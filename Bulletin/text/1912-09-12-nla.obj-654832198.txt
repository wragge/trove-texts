The Irish
Quite the most readable book on Ireland
is My Irish Year, by Padraic Colum (Mills
and Boon, per Sydney Book Club). The
Ireland this Irishman writes of is merely
Catholic and Peasant 'lreland, and in this
localised strip of country the author views
the life chiefly in its agrarian aspect. But
he claims that the Catholic peasantry are
not merely the bulk of the Irish population,
but, roughly speaking, the historic Irish
nation. The life described is utterly strange
to Australian readers. He shows how the
marriage customs arc largely responsible for
emigration. For instance, Bridget, the
second daughter of an Irish farmer, has to
emigrate to America to earn her dowry;
without it she could not marry in her own
class. She could stay and marry a laborer
without a dowry, but not a farmer’s son.
So off she goes to become a servant in
America, to come back some day and marry
a farmer in Ireland. That is, if one will
have her, for a dowry is not earned easily
or quickly. Half of the Bridgets are never
heard of again. Out of 40 young men and
women who leave Ireland, most of them
intending to return, 36 don’t.
The sort of speech with which the Irish
dramatists have familiarised us occurs on
nearly every page.’ Colum states that this
picturesque imagery, infused with a sense of
rhythm, is the common speech of the
peasants. Incidentally, he prints “The
Tinker’s Curse” :
“The Tinker never goes under a roof.
Here’s what the tinker says when he passes
your house and mine:—
You build houses! Ay, like the crows, you put stick
and stick together.
May I see a scatter of sticks and the kites a-chase
through the wood!
You live man and wife, you say, like the goats, two
and two a-tether.
For fear ye would reach to the hedge-tops, and
the wild taste- get in your blood!
But there are more blistering curses re-
corded —one bard curses his three enemies
in every one of 26 Verses, mentioning them
by name, with a variety of invective super-
bly Irish. Here is a nice little “rann” :
May a messenger come from the high place of God,
To bear up your soul to a throne— V
But a robber be robbing him on the way back,
And your fall be as dead as a stone. *
May your tables be laden with gold and with jewels,
And your hands be upon them for proof,
When the Devil whips in by your' beggarly door,
And tears your red soul through the roof.
The author has made a delightful collec-
;ion of peasant love-songs. Here is the man
to the woman: —
O Una, O maiden, 0 friend, and 0 golden tooth!
O little mouth that never uttered an injustice,
I had rather be beside her on a couch, ever kissing
her,
Than to be sitting in Heaven on the chair of the
Trinity.... -
O fair Una, it is you that set astray my senses;
O Una, it was you who went close in between me
and God;
O Una, fragrant branch, twisted little curl of the
ringlets,
Was it not better for me to be without eyes than
ever to have seen you?
And here the woman to the man: —
And farewell henceforth to yon town westward
among the trees; it is there I am drawn early and
late. Many is the wet, dirty morass and crooked
road going between me and the town where my treas-
ure i 5.... 0 Paddy; are you sorry that I am ill, and
do you think bad of me that I am going to the
I churchyard ? O Paddy, of the bound black hair, it
is your mouth that is sweet; and until I go under
the ground, my affection will be on you for your con-
verse with me..,.And Oh, dear Virgin, what shall
I do if you go from me? I have no knowledge of
your house, your haggard, or your stacks. Ah, faith-
ful was the counsel that my people gave me not to
elope with you, for you have the hundred twists in
your heart and the thousand tricks.
Or Sappho in Ireland: —
I am sitting tip
Since the moon rose last night,
And putting down a fire
And ever kindling it diligently ;
The people of the house are lying down,
And I am by myself;
The cocks are crowing,
And the land is asleep but me.
That I may never leave the world
Till I loosed from me the ill-luck,
Till I have cows and sheep,
And my one desire of a boy.
I would not think the night long,
That I would be stretched- by his smooth white
breast,
And sure I would-allow the raoe of Eve after that
To say their choice thing of me.... The curse of the
Son of God
Upon the one who took from me my love,
And left me by myself
Every single long night in misery.
And, O young boy,
I am no material for mockery for you ;
You have nothing to say
Except that I am without dowry. You are not my
love,
And my destruction, if I am sorry for it ;
And if I am without cattle,, I am able to lie alone.

Eardley Turner objects to a “Red Page”
statement that Zangwill is “the latest liter-
ary recruit to the drama.” He states that
Z. had a one-act piece produced in London
25 years ago, and has been busy since, find-
ing a ready market in the U.S., and during
the last five years has had a play running
every season in America. But the conten-
tion was that his recent plays, The War
God and The Next Religion were his first
contribution to “the modern drama of ideas.”
That contention stands.
Fiction
The Red Page
The main objection to fiction is that so
often it is fiction. The novel presents
characters purporting to be real; for a few
chapters you accept the author’s premises
and takes his carefully constructed
puppets on trust. The hero is at
first a decent enough chap; but the
crisis comes, and' he behaves with a
heroism that instinctively you know
could not exist in real life, while the heroine,
beginning as a mere pretty woman, develops
into a subtle, complicated piece of psychol-
ogy that certainly does not exist in
your suburb. Of course, if you want fic-
tion, you can always depend on getting it;
but if you desire a basis of truth, the solid
earth _ beneath you, few fiction waiters will
give it to you. No matter how realistic
they are, their heroes and heroines are a few
inches taller, by a few subtleties finer, than
even the most heroic individual you happen
to know. They are even more heroic than
yourself. The fictionists will tell you that
this is their trade, to depict imaginary
characters; but no mature reader can go on
being interested in beings whom he knows
■'do not, and cannot, exist except in the illus-
trations of the average novel.
Take a novel like The Green Vase , by
William R. Castle, Junr. (Dodd, Mead, per
Dymock’s Library). This is a book with an
original plot, admirably written. There is
the crude, ambitious, good-fellow husband
and the cultured bride, taken to live in South
Boston, in a house with lace curtains and a
hideous green vase, the gift of a Philistine
Uncle John. There is the cultured 'aristo-
crat who loves her. An accident happens;
the wife is supposed to have been killed, but
is rescued in a senseless condition by the
other man. When she recovers conscious-
ness months afterwards, she finds herself
apparently the wife of the other man. She
has lost all memory of her past. Her child
—her husband’s child—is born, and the
alleged husband takes her away out west.
The woman does not love the man; all her
affection is for her child. The man conveni-
ently dies after six years ; and the real hus-
band conveniently arrives, woos his unsus-
pecting wife again, re-marries her, and
takes her back to the house of the green
vase. The sight of that atrocity restores
her memory. And the crudeness of her hus-
band has disappeared. After her supposed
death he had recognised his lack of culture,
and had succeeded in making himself the
man she had wished him to be. He remains
the one real person in the book. The wife,
a mere snobbish, foolish, cowardly girl, is
presented to us by the author as a divinity
of complex mentality—the rather nauseat-
ing American worship of the woman in fic-
tion. Both she and her lover have been
etherealized and sublimated out of recog-
nition as part of our common humanity.
#
Nineteen years ago, on the appearance of
her brilliant Ships that Pass in the Night,
Beatrice Harradan’s name suddenly fore-
shadowed great literary possibilities. But
none of her succeeding novels, though show-
ing honest workmanship, sustained the hope
of her first book. Now in Out of the Wreck
I Rise (Nelson, per Dymock’s Library), she
shows the same qualities that gave her
Ships such popularity. The novel starts
brilliantly, with the threatened exposure of
a celebrated dramatic agent, whom his
clients find to have been regularly appropriat-
ing huge amounts of their royalties. The
dramatic agent has not fallen through a
temporary weakness: he is temperamentally
a clever thief; and no attempt is made by
the author to palliate or excuse his crime.
Nor do the two women whom in the past he
had subjugated by his dominant personality,
and thrown aside, make any excuses for
him. In a revival of their old jealous
rivalry they set to work to save him—
though both know that the sacrifices they
make are doomed to futility. One of the
women, a Jewess, who deals in antiquities
and jewels, is herself a professional cheat.
Both women are drawn with a masterly
hand, and the complex character of the
dramatic agent is admirably and convinc-
ingly presented. There is also a strange
clergyman, who seems merely a woman’s
abstraction —purely fictional. The book
does not end : the suicide of the dramatic
agent is an admitted failure of the author’s
craftsmanship. - The style is delightful. The
effort of the author seems to be to prove
that the failure of the man’s life is necessary
to develop and enrich the lifes of all that
he has come into contact with. The very
wounds that he has inflicted are shown to
be the beginning of the healing of their
souls. Out of his wreck they rise.
Algernon Blackwood continues on his
chosen path. His latest volume, Pan's
Garden (Macmillan), is a collection of
nature stories ; but his Nature is consciously
alive, just as it took visible form in his
preceding book, The Centaur. ' This time
we have stories dealing with the “group-
soul” of such things as a forest, the sea,
fire, snow, sand, a township and clay.
“The Man whom the Trees Loved,” for in-
stance, begins on the note: “I wonder
whether a tree in any lawful meaning of the
term can be —alive. I remember some writ-
ing fellow telling me long ago that trees
had once been moving things, animal organ-
isms of some sort, that had stood so long
feeding, sleeping, dreaming, or something, in
the same place, that they had lost the power
to get away.” Then comes a statement by
Prof. Darwin, president of the Roval Soci-
ety, suggesting that “we must believe that
in plants there exists a faint copy of what
we know as consciousness in ourselves.”
Prom this historical premise it is but a step
to the suggestion of a group-consciousness
in a forest.
“Behind a great forest may stand a
rather splendid Entity that manifests,
through all the thousand individual trees,
some huge collective life, quite as minutely
and delicately organised as our own. It
might merge and blend with ours under cer-
tain conditions, so that we could understand
it by being it, for a time at least. It might
even engulf human vitality into the immense
whirlpool of its own vast dreaming life. The
pull of a big forest on a man can be tre-
mendously and utterly overwhelming.”
So. set the scene in a lonely cottage sur-
rounded by a forest, with the great herded,
mass of the trees wanting to “get” the man
they loved, protected only by a cedar
tree, and you have, all the eerie properties
with which Algernon Blackwood can so
shudderingly play.
And if trees have a group-soul, why not
sand? Suppose there were big souls, so
huge and complex that they could not ex-
press themselves in a single individual, but
needed an entire group for manifestation?
“In the lower ranges of humanity—cer-
tainly in animal and insect life—one soul
is shared by many. Behind a tribe of
savages stands one Savage. A flock of
birds is a single Bird, scattered through the
consciousness of all. They wheel in mid-
air, they migrate, they obey the deep intelli-
gence called instinct —all as one. An ant-
heap is a single Ant; through the bees
spreads the consciousness of a single Bee.”
Why not, then, the group-soul of a large
flat thing like the desert? Away to Egypt
and evoke the ancient intelligences of lost
Atlantis, and by the right incantations make
the Desert stand on end! How an artist is
caught in this stupendous experiment is
told by Blackwood in Sand, with a magic
not second to that of The Garden of Allah.
*
Again, if a human soul, at the moment
of death, can return to that which gave it
life, that which it loves best, why not the
apparition of a group-soul? In “The De-
struction of Smith,” the authbr comes peril-
ously near farce in his extreme application
of this idea. Ilis apparition, his ghost, is
no_ single soul, but the soul of a whole town-
ship. A man named Smith founded a min-
ing township in. America. While he is away
on a hunting trip he becomes conscious that
something has happened to his beloved
ship. And in that lonely camp his companions
see. the tremendous ghost of Smithville,
which had been suddenly wiped out by fire,
roaring across the sky, returning to the soul
of the one man who had given it being.
“The personality of the town, set free and
loosened in the moment of death, had re-
turned to him who gave it birth, who loved
it, and of whose life it was actually an ex-
pression. The Being of Smithville was lit-
erally a projection, an 'emanation of the
dynamic, vital personality of its puissant
creator. And, in death, it had returned on
him with the shock of an accumulated power
impossible for a human being to resist. For
years he had provided it with life—but
gradually. It now rushed back to its source,
thus concentrated, in a single terrific mo-
ment.”
Of course, the soul of burnt-up Smithville-
(loss of life, 3000) exploded Smith. The
moral seems to be not to found townships.
But this is the only story in this weird eal-
lection that “lets dotvn” the reader. The
others, granting the author’s premises of
group-entities—of which there is some
scientific probability—carry sufficient surface
conviction to allay the reader’s suspicions,
and make them admirable examples of a new
form of ghost story. A most readable and
interesting book.
**
Sequels are always a mistake. Elsie
Lindt tier (Lane), the sequel to Karin
Michaelis’s striking book, The Dangerous
Age, is a catastrophe. There was a hitherto
untouched theme in that noteworthy book;
but the heroine grows wearisome, and'a trifle
ridiculous, in her continuous harping on that
theme. Her later life is scarcely interest-
ing. She travels, adopts a child from the
gutter, tames him and sees him started on
the road to success on a farm, and feels for
him the mother-love that all her life she had
missed. But, as in the previous book, she
has too much time to think ; only in her care
for her adopted child and her new interest
in the lives of her friends does she find relief
from her sterile selfishness. But the book
is carelessly written, and her observations
have none of the originality that made her
first book so interesting. Exit Elsie Lindtner
and her obsession, with relief.
The Matador of the Fire Towns
(Methuen) shows Arnold Bennett’s mastery
of the short story. The title story has
about it the atmosnhere of great art: this
story of sordid happenings to commonplace
persons—“mean, harsh, ugly, squalid, crude,
barbaric”—has in it “the true, fine, romantic
savor of life.” Bennett has the sense of
true romance, .as. Conrad has defined
Romance. But it is chiefly in the tragic
stories, and not in the “frolic” stories, that
Bennett has the sure touch of the mature
artist. His knowledge of life, his shrewd-
ness, his genial humor, are to be found in
these light-hearted frolics, such as “Catching
the Train” and “The Long-lost Uncle,” but
the slightness of the plots too often detracts
from this amiable fooling.
J*
The novel which is rightly said to mark
the flood-tide of the genius of Anatole
France, La Rotisserie de la Heine Pedauque
appears in translation in Lane’s sumptuous
edition of this author’s works as At the Siqn
of the Reine P6dauque (per Lockley Li-
brary). This work—not meant, of course,
for babes or flappers-Mntroeluces us to the
Rabelaisian Abbe, Maitre Jerome Coignard,
the pax-ent, in his turn, of such a hero as
William J. Locke’s Beloved Vagabond. And,
as Locke, in an excellent foreword, says, of
all. France’s heroes we love most this scape-
grace Abbe.
“Even were he a layman we should call him
a pretty scoundrel; but, priest that he is, we
have no words wherein to summarise the
measure of his fall from grace. He drinks,
he brawls, he cheats at cai-ds ; he cannot pass
a pretty girl on the stairs but his arm slips
round her waist; to follow in Pandarus’s
footsteps causes him no compunction; he
“borrows” half a dozen bottles of wine from
an inn, and runs away with his employer’s
diamonds. At first sight he appears to be
an unconscionable villain. But endow him
with the inexhaustible learning, the philoso-
phy. the mansuetude, the wit of Monsieur
Bergeret, imagine him a Sylvesti'e Bonnard
qualified for the personal entourage of Pan-
tagruel, and you have a totally different con-
ception of his character.”
The story of the adventures of the narra-
tor and this great-hearted scoundrel affords
the author full scope for his learning, his
naivety, his quiet irony, his broad and genial
philosophy. The Abbe and his pupil are
taken into the service of an alchemist, where
the youth finds adventures and the AbbC
good philosophy and good liquor. One esca-
pade is gloriously and unctuously told—the
strange drunken supper of four ill-assorted
individuals. Swift follows an elopement,
pursuit and the death of the Abbd, who makes
an end as edifying as that of ITalstaff—from
whose recoi-ded death the author is not
above borrowing well-known details —and
the youth, bereft of his teacher, finds in a
book-shop the quiet so. dear to a scholar’s
soul. The book is a virile, sanguine tour de
force. Humor broad and ironic, philosophy
pagan and devout, and a sense of life har-
monising the whole outlook, create for us a
chai’acter unforgettable.
The only golf-expert on the staff, the Reli-
gious Editor, now being on his annual six
months’ vacation in Paris, this office is un-
able critically to review The A.rt of Golf, by
Joshua Y. Taylor, with a chapter on the
evolution of the Bunker, by J. H. Taylor,
ex-champion (Laurie) ; but the book seems
to have the usual allowance of photogi’aphs
of hard-faced men swinging sticks, and, con-
sidering the poorness of golf-links soil, the
crop of bunkers seems remarkably encourag-
ing.
Mary Gaunt, whose book, ALlone in West
Africa, recently reviewed here, is having a
big sale, hopes to do for the Northern Terri-
tory what she did for the black continent—
prove that the white wotnan can adapt her-
self to life in the tropics without discbm-
fort or ill effects. She intends to ride
through the whole of the Territory, and
from her experiences produce a book which
should be as informative and as interesting
as 'her reeent work.
Sumner Locke, the author of Mum Daw-
son, Boss —that bright piece of Australian
humor —On-our-Selection brand, but up
to sample—follows with further cheerful
chronicles of her back-blocks family. This
time it is The Dawsons’ Uncle' George
(N.S.W. Bookstall Co.). The worst feature
of this school of humor, of which this is an
excellent specimen, is that it paints the back-
blocks as the scene of such continuous orgies
of hilarious happenings that there is a dan-
ger that the cities will be depopulated in the
rush for the bush.
A valuable statistical volume is the re-
written new edition of Porter’s Progress of
the Nation (Methuen), brought up to date
by F. W. Hirst, editor of The Economist.
The Nation is Great Britain, an admir-
able survey of all that nation’s leading
trades, accompanied by official statistics,
chapters on foreign commerce, on coinage,,
banking, insurance, postal developments, in-
ternal transit, the growth of national wealth
and capital, etc., is of immediate value to
the world.
The sevenpenny novels (9d. here) of
Heinemann ( per George Robertson, Syd-
ney) are well worth purchase. A list of
five samples, excellently produced in cloth

Soldiers of Fortune (R. H. Davis), The
War of the Worlds (H. G. Wells), The Gall
of the Wild (Jack London), The Bondman
(Hall Caine).
The late Andrew Lang, translator, scien-

it takes the British Museum Catalogue 16
pages to enumerate, will not be long remem-
bered. He did so many things so indiffer-
ently well.

Beauty’s Favourite.
The article which excels all others
in improving the beauty of the skin
is naturally and deservedly beauty’s
favourite. This has been the
acknowledged and honoured
position held by Pears’ Soap for
nearly 120 years. It won, and has
maintained that position by virtue
of its complete purity, and by the
possession of those special emollient
properties which soften, refine,
and impart natural colour to the
skin. No other soap possesses
these qualities in such a pre*
eminent degree as
PEARS
Matchless for the Complexion.

Brain-fag
When the delicate mechanism of your
brain is disorganised by worry and over-
work, so that you are incapable of con-
centrated thought, “Wincarnis” will
speedily revitalise your poor, over-strained
nerves, and give you a delicious feeling
of renewed mental energy that will enable
you to think quickly—plan effectively
act promptly. No man can think
with a worn-out brain. But here is
Vvincarnis,” ready at a moment’s notice
to stimulate your brain, nourish your
starved nerves, and give you back your
old-time mental activity.
Anaemia.
The pallid complexion—the transpar-
ent skin—the lustreless eyes—tell, only
too plainly, the story of insufficient blood.
But “Wincarnis” will soon give a bright-
ness to the eyes, and coax back the roses
to the cheeks. And as you take your
“Wincarnis” you will find yourself, day
by day, getting stronger—brighter—
healthier —as the grandly nourishing
qualities of “Wincarnis” create a fund of
rich, red blood and send it dancing
through your veins, to carry health,
strength and nourishment to every part
of the body.
Sleeplessness
Only those who suffer from sleepless-
ness realise the intense misery of the in-
cessant tossing to and fro —the agonising
wait for daybreak—and the feeling of
utter exhaustion in the morning. Sleep-
lesness is due to a disordered state of the
brain cells, therefore, although the body
may be thoroughly worn out, the brain
is in such a highly-strung condition that
sleep is impossible. A wineglassful of
“Wincarnis” taken just before retiring
will soothe that highly-strung brain, and
ensure you an uninterrupted and sweetly
refreshing night’s rest.
Convalescence
In prolonged convalescence after a
severe illness, the effect of “Wincarnis”
is almost magical. From the first, and
after each succeeding wineglassful, “Win-
carnis” imparts a delicious feeling of
renewed vitality. And day by day the
patient gets stronger and brighter, the
appetite improves, and the blush of health
returns to the cheeks. A wealth of rich, red
blood is created which circulates through-
out the body, and rebuilds the worn-out
tissues, revitalises the weakened nerves
and braces up the system so that the
whole body pulsates with renewed life.
fgh
The above are but four of the many cases in which “Wincarnis” is of such inestimable value as a nerve food, a
blood-maker and a recuperative tonic. This is why so many thousands of people who at one time were suffering
from Debility, Depression, Anaemia, Sleeplessness, Brain-fag and Nervous disorders are to-day in the full en-
joyment of vigorous health. Will you try just one bottle of
fg
AN ALMOST MIRACULOUS RECOVERY.
Mr. Stott, of 8 Crosby Street, Holbeck, Leeds, wrote us that his aged grandmother was down with Chronic
Bronchitis and a Weak Heart, and so ill was she that all the relatives were summoned to the bedside. She ex-
pressed a wish for “Wincarnis,” which was immediately procured, and within half an hour of taking the first
■dose of “Wincarnis” the struggle for breath ceased, and from that moment she began to mend. Five days after-
wards she was able to get up and sit near the fire.
Wincarnis is sold by all Wine Merchants, Licensed Chemists and Grocers.

A Melbourne citizen was lately farewelled
with a gold watch presentation on the eve
of his departure on a trip abrawd. In his
long, unnecessary speech he covered all the
ground from Dan to Beersheba, dragging
in references to his native land, his fore-
fathers, school days, college, travels, aristo-
cratic friends and acquaintances, employers,
fellow motorists, intentions, probable move-
ments, and other more or less relevant
matters. Then he sat down. The only
thing he forgot was to thank the audience
for the watch.

“Peruvian Rubber Atrocities —Horrible Revela-
tions.”—Scare cable headings, scanned hastily in the
tram.
Of rubber horrors in Peru I read without a tear;
I am not grieved exceedingly—l’m hardly pained, I
fear.
In vain with far atrocities they ply us in the dawn ;
Man’s inhumanity to man makes countless thousands
yawn.
N.s.w. CONSTANT READER.
July Pearson’s has some ecstatic puff-
paragraphs about its forthcoming serial,
“The Recipe for Rubber,” by Ralph Stock,
with strenuous pictures (samples given) by
Norman Lindsay. The tale has run its
course in The Lone Hand, and has for some
time been out in book form! Australian
stuff must be popular in England if a pro-
minent magazine like Pearson’s is willing
to use it at second-hand in this way.
The Fisher Government has encouraged
the importation of pretty well everything
but widows; and now Bramwell Booth, boss
of the Salvation Army, proposes to complete
the list by shipping out loads of sighing
ladies in sad, black garments with black-
framed portraits of the deceased in their
trunks. Fisher’s non-committal answer,
when asked if he intended to adopt the new
Booth’s proposal, leaves the question
shrouded, so to speak, in croom (which is
part crape and part gloom). Widows vary
considerably as regards disposition, looks
and wage-earning capacity; but in the aver-
age they are saddened, hard-up ladies of
limited business experience, who have lost
the first blush of youth. The field of useful-
ness open to the somewhat-faded widow is a
small one. She is unable to swindle on the
Stock Exchange, or go mining; she can’t be
a professional footballer, or fight under
Mclntosh management, or be the flying
angel attached to a steam crane. These and
many other less picturesque jobs are closed
to her on account of her sex, and age, and
faded condition. The kitchen is her most
promising sphere. If she is prepared to fill
the apron of departed Mary Ann. and man
the deserted washing-up tin and dustpan,
this country will gladly give her a nail to
hang the departed’s picture on, and listen
sympathetically to her reminiscences. It is
healthier to have the housework done in a
spirit of youthful gaiety ; but if there is no
gaiety or youth available, the imported lady
of grief is welcome to groan over the gas-
stove and go sighing after the dust like a
lonely midnight wind. But the Australian
sunlight, that champion dissipator of sorrow,
may revive her so much that she will refuse
to consider anything but an engagement, in
the chorus. Andrew Fisher, should think
deeply before he orders any foreign widows.
“Chudah” writes from Bethlehem: —
The Chief Rabbi-ship of England, in succession to
Adler, is not filled, although a year has elapsed. A
Hebraic writer in the last Contemporary Review
tips five men, and the first one is Dr. Joseph Abra-
hams, of the West Melbourne Synagogue. There is
no Chief Rabbi in Germany, France, Austria or the
United States.' Consequently .it is. argued that none
is required in England. Adler was intensely conser-
vative. He was supposed to control Australia, and
threatened to cut both Sydney and Melbourne off in
consequence of independent Synagogic practices, such
as ladies singing in choirs, sexes sitting together, and
the introduction of the English language into the
service. Montefiore leads the Reformed English
Jews, with synagogues in London, Manchester and
Bradford. Lord Rothschild heads the Conservatives,
with a body called the Great Synagogue. This de-
mands a Chief Rabbi, and he must be English. What-
ever the danger may be, there is more hazard now
than at any time of Jewry falling to pieces. Maybe
only Russian persecution holds it together. Liberal
Synagogues are just becoming Christian churches of
the free and easy type to which many churches are
reduced. Higher Criticism of the Bible makes in-
roads corresponding to those in Churchianit.y.
“San Down” speaks a piece, fragment or
scrap:—
It is quite likely that, when Wootton, senior, made
his assertion (cabled 29/8/’l2) that the English
Jockey Club stewards are “hounding” his son Stanley
the jockey, out of the racing game, he was entirely
correct. The stewards invariably perform this act
in the case of any lad who gets a bit above himself —
which accounts for the circumstance that the British
jock, however successful and affluent, is about the
most humble, self-abasing, forelbck-dragger on God’s
green earth. The classic example of the exercise of
the wiping-out prerogative was the case of Tod Sloan.
Sloan’s extraordinary success in the saddle in the
late ’9o’s, revolutionised the flat race riding game in
England, and earned him a fortune. It also gave him
swelled head. He dined ostentatiously at restaurants
like the Savoy (sacred to the upper classes and the
corps de ballet ), gave glittering and highly-alcoholic
parties at his hotel in London, and, worst offence of
all, he gambled freely and publicly. I have often
seen Tod arriving, in the large barouche he used to
affect, with three gaming pals, at Lingfield, or one of
the other courses within driving distance of London,
and only putting aside the cards as his conveyance
stopped at the gates. The word went round that he
was backing his own mounts. Of course he backed
his own mounts, as do 90 per cent, of the crack
riders of the present time. What was never charged
against him was the far more serious offence of
laying against the horses he steered —a common habit
in the days of the “jockeys’ ring,” which burst
shortly before Sloan went to England. Anyhow, it
was decided that he should go. His gaming proclivi-
ties were rhentioned casually as the reason. The
real explanation was, probably, his rash act in bid-
ding at Newmarket for a yearling when a representa-
tive of King Edward was in the ring, and after the
animal. Also, there was the waiter-felling episode at
Ascot. However, no reasons were ever officially
given for his extirpation. That is the way with
turf-rulings in England, for the most part. The
Jockey Club decides that such and such an action
is “for the good of racing,” and the thing goes.
Tod was noiselessly wiped out. To be . wiped out in
England is tantamount to being wiped out everywhere
that big racing flourishes, and Tod has not figured
aboard a racer at any important meeting since. If
the Jockey Club stewards have a down on young
Wootton he is doomed in the capacity of race-rider.
In any case, his narent will but hasten the downfall
by making a public outcry about the lad’s troubles.
The Jockey Club has shown repeatedly that it cares
about as much for the enraged clamor of the popu-
lace as the Spanish Inquisition did for the chidings
of foreign heretics. The Wootton family’s best hope
of evading the trouble that apparently threatens is
for each and every member thereof to remove his or
her hat, and kneel reverentially before addressing a
person of title; for the whole crowd to join a
Christian Temperance and Anti-Gaming League;
and for them all to be very, very ’umble as regards
clothes, deportment and social habits. Incidentally,
it would be a subtly astute move to gag Father
Wootton when in the presence of newspaper reporters.
In fact, this would probably be the most effective
manoeuvre of all.

“ It is impossible to over-estimate the import-
ance of the teeth and mouth both as factors
of health and as sources of disease. Every
neglected decaying tooth in the mouth is
a well-spring of poison in the body.”
Odol does more than cleanse and
beautify the teeth; it preserves them from decay;
it refreshes the whole mouth to the point of exhilaration,
keeps the gums healthy and free from tenderness, and
delightfully perfumes the breath.
And by a remarkable property, peculiar to Odol alone,
it permeates the mucous membrane of the entire oral cavity
j
with its antiseptic elements, leaving the mouth proof
for hours afterwards against the attacks of injurious bacteria,
which, if not guarded against, inevitably destroy the teeth.
Until science produced Odol the world was without a
dentifrice that was capable of completely preventing or
arresting dental decay, but when it was found that Odol really
did this, its success became a matter of course, and quickly
spread over every civilised region. Millions of bottles are
now sold annually, and every month the sale largely increases.

gf
hg
FAT PEOPLE. Excess fat
injures your health, impedes
your movements, and makes
you the butt of your unfeel-
ing normal - weight friends.
People who have been fat,
and are now reduced to nor-
mal, think other fat people
ridiculous.
Not alone does excess fat
injure your health and en-
danger your existence, it ab-
solutely destroys your figure
and makes you a ludicrous
sight. Why do you stay fat?
“FATCURE” positively re-
moves excess fat, and will re-
store your spoiled figure to
decent and pleasing propor-
tions, and is always a sure
and lasting cure for obesity
and corpulency. A few doses
improves your breathing won-
derfully, and the course of
treatment will permanently cure you.
Is the only successful and. at the same time,
harmless, fat-reducer that has ever been dis-
covered. Its efficacy has been undeniably de-
monstrated in thousands of successfully treated
cases. It is totally and absolutely non-poison-
ous, and can in no wise work any injury to the
general health; though it often reduces excess
weight by as much as a pound a day.
THIN WOMEN.
If you are flat-
chested, thin, run
down and scraggly-
even if you never
had a nicely-rounded
bosom, Dr. Falliere’s,
Flesh-food will build
you up and develop
your figure. Does

your mirror mock you? Flesh-food will remove
the faults in your figure by rounding out and de-
veloping the deficient places. Put up in Tablet
form, it is easy to use and pleasant to take, and,
if desired, may be taken secretly. Taken under
our directions, it will work wonders for your ap-
pearance. Results guaranteed in every case ac-
cepted.
In many cases bust measurements have been
increased by over ten inches, and the weight
over five pounds weekly. Other cases have
shown an increase in weight of even a pound a
day. The average bust increase desired is about
six inches, and is readily accomplished.
FLESH-FOOD offers relief and development
to the thousands of chronically thin women who
have despaired of ever possessing a presentable
figure. It is a nerve and tissue food treatment
that adds weight and permanent development to
attenuated women. Thousands endorse it.

VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Whiskers of George.
The wide world wears a shaven chin,
And bare and cold appear to me
The rigid lip and visage thin
Forlorn of manly mystery;
I dream of whiskers in the sun,
Wild whiskers flaming down the world,
And manly jaws that would not shun
The hair that nature round them curled.
Ah, beard to beard at windy Troy,
The foemen shook the shining spear;
What razored fool or hairless boy
In such a battle might appear?
Their armor clanged, their voices threw
Defiance in tremendous words,
The while like fencing wire outflew
Jaw-growths entangled in their swords.
Goat-tufted merchants of the prime
From Tvre and Carthage pushed their
ships,
And Israel’s prophets wove sublime
The whiskers of Apocalypse ;
And up and down the living world
Were splendid jaws that would not shun
To wear their hirsute flag unfurled
Flaunting defiance at the sun.
Thor beat his hammer on the cloud.
And flashing in the tonmost height,
While thunder bellowed long and loud,
His face adornments split the night;
The Goth and Vandal southward sped
Their conquering arms by land and sea,
Vaunting o’er kings and nations dead
Their chin-mats red with destiny.
Then the glad maid in street and hall
Walked on bright feet that only feared
The rapture of a sudden fall
Through tripping in her lover’s beard ;
The times seemed vbry bright and fair
From Babylon to Astrakhan
When cataracts of rolling hair
Fell earthward from the face of man.
Ah. bare and cold appear to me
The rigid lip and visage thin
That, lorn of manly mystery,
Surmount the harsh and shaven chin ;
But some kind fate that guards my
Has sent George from his Queensland
home
All bearded like the morn of Greece.
And whiskered as was purple Rome !

The Price of Peace.
After the battle, through the night,
We rode along the line of fight.
And one there was whom men had caught
To kill him for the lies he taught;
The lies that nursed in sluggard ease
Our fenceless land, our naked seas.
“He was the first to fly,” they said,
“And left his hearthstone to its dead.”
But ere they tore him limb from limb,
We horsemen laid our hands on him;
And all along the tortured track,
Careless of death, we led him back.
We showed him where his rafters stood,
Tops black with flame, roots red with blood.
With butchered babe and shame-slain wife
We stabbed his eyes as with a knife.
And in that place of dreadful shade,
We left him to the Peace he made.

The Visionary.
I set my heart on a single end,
I pledged my life to a certain cause;
The world against me —I did not bend;
High mountains fronting—l would not
pause.
I gave the best that my soul could give—
The morning hope and the nightly dream ;
“My star.” exulting. I cried, “shall live.
Shall brighten man with its lustrous
beam !”
Old Time limped by on his worm-bored staff.
And, sidewise eyeing me, shook his head ;
The world passed on with a mocking laugh :
“What fool yells yonder?” the wise men
said.
T borrowed the painter’s magic brush,
The zealot’s, fire and the poet’s thought;
Like some high peak in the dawn ablush,
Alone in a roseate glow I wrought.
How fared I? 111, in truth—so ill
That I, myself, am moved to iest- —
To think that one so weak of will
Should tread the stars in glorious quest.
I failed, and all my splendid youth
Is spent with all its great desire;
For me remains this homely truth —
One log can never make a fire.

Premiums.

tion to-day condemning the granting of the maternity
bonus in the case of illegitimate children, on the
ground that it was really offering a premium to vice.

I love these worthy foes of Sin,
And bend on them my curious gaze
To see their brains revolve and spin,
And mark with what resounding phrase
They beat the Devil andTiis ways.
What maids are these with notions queer.
Whom want alone keeps from the
slough—
Who’ll cry with rapture: “Lo, ’tis here,
The babv bonus,” and avow,
“So we can all be wicked now”?
Consider, holy men, the creed
Based on a Saviour’s sacrifice,
And tell us, is this splendid meed
To sinners all, your Paradise,
Also, a premium to vice?

THE INDICTMENT OF ANDREW
FISHER, FISCAL SINKER.
More than once, of late, The Bulletin has
felt called upon to remark that capital is
fleeing out of Australia, and it now notes
that the process is going on with increased*
velocity, if such a thing be., possible. It is
not a case of some disgusted or anguished in-
dividual selling a few gas shares, and going
away with the proceeds in his carpet bag;
or realising on some scrappy suburban mort-
gages, and sending the money to be invested
in real estate at Slocum-on-the-Wollop, in
the county of Slummockshire, 'England.
Things of that sort are liable to happen any
day, and they don’t create a rinnle that is
wortk 9d. on the surface of events. It isn’t
even a matter of some English bank, or in-
surance office, or land company, or bull-and-
cow-and-grass corporation, putting its capi-
tal into a liemid form, and sending it for in-
vestment to Paraguay or Tripoli or the Val-
ley of Jehoshaphat, where democratic legisla-
tion ceases from troubling, and the minimum
wage is at rest, and the only troubles are
occasional revolutions, and massacres, and a
tendency on the part of brigands to put the
Let of capitalists in the fire in order to make
them say where their money is hidden. The
country has been hearing of that sort of de-
parture for years past, but the event has
never happened in any large sense, though
the Tory press wept bitterly over it, and
has urged Australia to reconsider its ways
in time, and to treat the absentee with
respect and even kindness. The present
flight of capital is a real and obvious affair.
It is serious. Even if every English bank
and finance co. and pawnbroker} - that is
doing; business in these parts gathered up
its assets and fled —a thing which is often
foreshadowed but which never comes to
pass—it' would be of less importance than
the matter now, under consideration. The
amount involved would be smaller, and at the
worst Australia would be getting rid of bor-
rowed capital, which costs a fearful amount
per annum in interest and dividends. In
other words, this country would be paying
off old debts. The calamity of the hour is
that Australia is getting rid of its own capi-
tal. And, by doing so, it is discouraging
well-paid local industry; discouraging local
employment and settlement and population ;
offering a helping hand and a leg-up to the
foreign sweater and cheap laborer, and non-
unionist, and nigger; doing a grievous wrong
to White Australia; and making the country
more and more dependent on the extraneous
Cohen.
* * * *
. During the last few years the constant up-
ward movement of wages has made the tariff
more and more inefficient. It never was
very efficient, but when it was created it
made some pretence of covering the differ-
ence between Australian high wages, short
hours and comparative newness in the manu-
facturing business, and the lower wages,
longer hours and greater experience of cer-
tain foreign competitors. But when Aus-
tralian wages were persistently raised, and
hours were, in many cases, shortened, while
customs duties continued the same, and the
cheapest variety of foreign competitor re-
mained almost as cheap as of yore, the tariff
became a glaring failure. Within the last
few months there have been marvellous de-
velopments in Australian commerce. This
country, as has been mentioned on many occa-
sions, is a deeply-indebted place. It has
followed the primrose way to the three balls
of Lombardy until it has to pay between
£14,500,000 and £15,000,000 a year in inter-
est to. its foreign creditors, merely to pre-
vent its indebtedness from becoming any
worse than it already is. That is to say, if
it can export, in goods (which include silver
and all the base metals) and in gold, about
14£ million pounds worth per annum more
than it imports, and can do this without
reducing its local stock of money, it is pay-
ing its way. If it does better than that it is
reducing its debts. If it does worse than
that it has started a downward movement
which, if the movement isn’t checked, will
lead to low wages, long hours, poverty, hun-
ger, failure, pauperism and insolvency.
The foreign trade returns for the first
seven months of 1912 are now available.
They show that exports have somewhat dim-
inished, owing to poorer seasons and, in some
degree, to lower prices. A lot of people have
been clamoring for decreased cost of living,
and if the selling prices of this country’s
exports continue to go down they will get
it. The returns also show that imports have
increased far beyond the country’s capacity
to pay for them. The only visible reason is
that Australian wages have risen so far, that
the tariff, which hasn’t risen, no longer gives
the Australian worker an advantage; in fact,
that there are, outside Australia, low-wage
and long-hour artisans, or extra-expert arti-
sans, whose goods can pay the miserable
little duties and still undersell those of the
Australian. This is the record up to the
end of July

The statement may be complicated, yet
the principal features are obvious enough.
During a period of seven months the Com-
monwealth, by reason of its foreign debts,
requires to export, in goods and gold, about
£8,500,000 more than it imports in order to
keep its accounts square, and it requires to
do this without seriously reducing the local
stock of gold, unless it proposes to prepare
the way for a panic and a crash. During
the first seven months of 1911 the Common-
wealth failed to meet its obligations, so far
as' the mere export and import figures go, by
about £9,000,000, but as the exports of gold
didn’t nearly equal the production of gold,
the deficit was of little importance. The
country didn’t actually pay its bills; still it
had in hand the means to pay most of its
bills. But during the first seven months of
1912 the situation was different. The im-
ports increased immensely. The exports of
goods decreased. The , f gpld> production went
down disastrously and the gold* export went
up amazingly. With it all, imports were
much further in excess pf exports than they
were last year. Generally speaking, the
position is thus: So fgr as the year 1912
has 'gone, Aii’stralia has failed to meet its
obligations by /dmewhe.re between £8,000,000
and £9.000.001), and yet it has exported
much mure gold than 1 it produced. Conse-
quently. the banks have exhausted, or
gregtly reduced, (he, stocks of- money they
aoeff.mulated in London in the days when
Australian wages were not so, high, and im-
ports were not so' 'enormous, and when the
tariff held the balance more evenly between
the high-wage Australian and' the low-wage
Englishman. Fijrther, the banks have re-
duced their local stocks of coin to a serious
extent, just when the Australian output of
the precious metal is falling; and if the de-
mand for gold keeps on at the present rate,
and the output of gold diminishes at the
present rate, there is nothing ahead save
another great smash, and another long
dreary spell of poverty. The Australian
Governments’ have been already driven to <
the old, shiftless device of raising money in
England at high interest in order to keep the
boom afloat. And when somebody who wants
to borrow locally, even on the best security,
in order to develop the great natural re-
sources of Australia, and make money for
himself, and. incidentally, give employment
to the high-wage and short-hour worker, goes
to the local financial institutions, he is gen-
erallv met with the cold shoulder and the
hostile eye. So much gold has gone away
to pay for the goods of the sert and the
“scab” that the financial institutions are
holding on hard to what remains for the
protection of their depositors. If their cash
resources get down much lower, they must
begin to call in their advances. And that
means forced sales, and slump, and closing
up of industries, and poverty,, and pauper-
ism, and soup kitchens, and relief works, and
sand-shifting jobs, and all the old misery
over again. # #
The Australian Labor Government lias
“sunk the fiscal issue,” and declines, for
the present, to interfere with the tariff.
There is no reason why it should interfere
with the tariff if it can, while leaving the
tariff alone, find some means of checking
the outflow of gold, and the increase of
foreign liabilities, which arise through the
influx of more foreign goods than this coun-
try can honestly pay for. . The tariff ,is
neither a gospel nor a fetich, It is in-
tended to give work and good wages to the
people, and to put the, country into such a
position that it won’t require to pawn its
soul and its' prospects and ifs children to
the outside money-lender. If these things
can be achieved without a tariff, then that
institution is superfluous, and is of no more
value than a roofless dog kennel without
sides or a dog. Unfortunately, while the
Australian Government leaves the tariff
alone, it offers no other remedy for the pre-
sent difficulties. It is a slave to dry old
shibboleths that were evolved when the
Labor party had no prospect of securing
office. In the days when these precepts were
constructed, the party didn’t expect to bear
the responsibility of running the country, so
it merely provided for the easy job of criti-
cising the people who ran the country.
When the Labor men were not required to
carry the political burden, it was easy
enough to be neither Protectionist nor Free-
trade, nor anything else, just as a monkey
need have no views on naval tactics. But
the situation is difficult when the crowd
which refuses to take any responsibility for
the customs policy of the country has seized the
responsibility. Fisher and co. are people
with no fiscal opinions, who collect a salary
for having fiscal opinions. So far as this
matter goes, they are getting wages under
false pretences. In the struggle to avoid
committing themselves, they profess that
they are willing to raise duties when they
obtain power to raise wages to correspond,
which profession, considering that wages
have been going up for a long time, while
duties have been stationary, is the thinnest
kind of hypocrisy. It may save the face of
the Labor Government, but it doesn’t save
its character. The charge against Andrew
Fisher, the apostle of Labor and high wages
and short hours and White Australia, is
that, under his rule, this country has
become, more than ever before, the employer
of the slave, the sweated workman, the low-
wage workman, the long-hour workman, the
nigger, the Chinaman, the non-unionist —in
fact, the employer of everybody who is
repugnant to good Labor principles. These
accusations rest on the import returns, and
if Andrew Fisher has any evidence to
show to the contrary, it is time that he pro-
duced it.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Cost of an Unpatriotic Railway.
Further light has been thrown of late on
the lamentable Northern Territory railway
scheme, and it hasn’t tended to improve the
business. A new and unpleasantplement of
cost has been added to the matter. Even
before the new factor came in, the case
looked like a shameful sacrifice of the in-
terests of Australia to the interests of a
weakly-led political party. The Common-
wealth is pledged to the completion of the
transcontinental railway from Port Augusta
to Port Darwin —pledged hot only according
to the terms of the agreement whereby it
acquired the Territory, but by, the patriotic
necessity for opening up, settling and garri-
soning this great isolated possession, and
giving it, for defence purposes, .the shortest
possible line of communication with the
cities whence it may look for assistance in
time of need. But a party wants to substi-
tute for the short road to Adelaide a much
longer road to the inure remote and less im-
portant city of Brisbane, with a vast exten-
sion to the still more remote city of Sydney.
This line, instead of traversing the high
temperate tableland of the Territory, is to
invade the lowest, hottest and least promis-
ing parts of the Two eastern States. In fact,
it is to leave the Territory undeveloped. The
scheme is a purely State grab for Federal
unearned increment, but there are suffrages
behind it, and, under the party system, these
are not to be lightly disregarded. To keep
faith means losing votes in two States ; to
break faith also means the loss of votes,
but not so many votes. From a party stand-
point, the safest device, for the time at least,
is to be ’non-committal, to hang the matter
up as long as possible, to wait on the, chap-
ter of accidents, .and to leave the defence of
the North —the point which, by reason of
its nearness to Asia, wants defence most of
all —to chance or Providence for an in-
definite time longer. The railway can’t be
built from the south without the Govern-
ment committing itself as to the route, and
thus arousing the bitter animosity of some-
body. But it can be built from the north,
by way of a pretence at doing something,
down as far as the parting of the ways
without precipitating the quarrel, and if this
little bit of work is done gradually enough,
the very awkward decision may be post-
poned for quite a long while. That is the
course that it is proposed to adopt. No
doubt, as The Bulletin pointed out last
week, there are many objections to this
device from a patriotic point of view, how-
ever well it may suit party exigencies. So
long as the line is unfinished, which seems,
by present signs, to be a state of things
that will last for many years, building from
the north is merely supplying to any strong
enemy, who may secure Port Darwin and the
sea, so much more mileage of convenient arid
valuable and isolated- railway, whereby he
may overrun the country without any. possi-
bility of troops from the south coming to
oppose him. Six hundred miles of line
built from the south would carry Aus-
tralian soldiers well into the Territory,
while the invader at Port Darwin
would only have the present 145 miles
of railway to help his operations. The same
bit of work built from the north as an iso-
lated undertaking would give the invader
745 miles of line to assist his operations,
while the Australian troops wouldn’t have
a yard of iron road in the Territory at their
disposal. The southern idea is building for
Australia, while the northern one looks more
like building for Australia’s enemies to suit
party exigencies. And in addition to all
these drawbacks, it is now pointed out that
the unpatriotic method will be vastly the
more costly. It involves humping men and
stores and heavy material half-way round
Australia by sea, and then by rail, in order
to reach the scene of action, and paying
special wage rates because of the remoteness
and isolation of the job. Even on easy coun-
try where there are no private landlords to
be bought out, the invoice is estimated at
£lO,OOO a mile, which is about twice the
original guess. The Parkes-Condobolin
(N.S.W.) line, of similar gauge and also
over easy country, was built for ,£2085, and
the Dubbo-Coonamble line for £2516 per
mile. Making all allowance for the greater
cost of a railway that is to carry express
traffic, it is reckoned that the policy of
building from the north instead of the south
—building for our enemies instead of for
ourselves —is going to enhance the bill by
£3OOO per mile. Some very remarkable bills
are born of the Party Government system,
but this is a devil of a lot to pay for thi?
privilege of fixing a great work so that the
enemy will have, for many years, the bes(
possible chance of getting hold of it.
o
The Censure Vote that Failed.
There used to be—possibly there still is—
a saying among the simple-minded Metho-
dists of Wales and Cornwall to the effect
that a good man can afford to be a great
deal wickeder than a bad man “because the
Lord forgives much to His elect.” Conse-
quently it was the good man who sold the
worst adulterated goods, and had the most
dubious weights, and against whom it was
most necessary to lock the fowl house at
night. It may be that there is a similar
idea in politics, and it is held that the honest
party can afford to look more politically dis-
honest than the dishonest party, because it
has its honesty to fall back upon. The good
man of Wales is the Methodist Church mem-
ber. and the honest man of N.S.W. politics
is the Labor member. These reflections are
based on the fact that a motion of censure
propounded in the N.S.W. Assembly re the
case of Nielsen, M.L.A., was rejected with
great promptitude and by a fair majority.
Yet the Nielsen case doesn’t look credit-
able. That politician skied his portfolio
over a difference with his colleagues in the
matter of leasehold v. freehold. The part}
is committed to the leasehold principle, but
Nielsen considered, rightly or wrongly, that
his colleagues were, beginning to temporise
and hunt for the line of least resistance. A
man who threw up his portfolio on a point
of doctrine might vote against his party, on
the same point, and the Government majority
wasn’t large enough to endure shocks of
that sort. Or he might resign and stand
again as a man who had differed from his
party. In that case, the men he had differed
from might allow him to. be re-elected as an
Independent, which,, as matters stood; Would
probably, have been political suicide. Or they
might have put up a candidate against him,
and split the old Labor vote ; and, seeing that
the Labor majority at Yass in 1910 was only
408 in a vote of 5818, that proceeding .would
probably have made a present of the seat to
Wade, That would, almost certainly have
been political suicide. There is no direct
evidence that the party considered these diffi-
culties, but the fact remains that the posi-
tion was desperately awkward. And when
Nielsen was sent to the United States on
a rather hazy and indefinite mission, and a
very reliable enemy (Waddell) was in-
duced to pair with this very unreliable
friend, the position of the, : McGowen Gov-
ment was greatly .improved. Nielsßn
absent, but paired, with an opponent,
was equal to an assured supporter;
while Nielsen present was noth If Nielsen
had gone away to serve N.S.W. in the United
States on a salary, he would have liad to
resign his. seat, and the seat might have been
lost, and Waddell could not have paired
with him, for when he resigned there , would -
have been nobody to pair with.'. - But he
could, and did, go away with ah allowance
for expenses and retained his seat. The allow-
ance seems to be the magnificent stuu .of
£4 4s. (sometimes mentioned as £4) a day,
which makes £2B or £29 a week. There is
no evidence to show that Nielsen’s <?Nt
penses amounted to this or anything like
it; certainly the published record (if. { his.
travels doesn’t suggest that they did. And
if his “ex.’s” only amounted t<6 (say) half
his allowance, then the other half was pra<; !
tically ‘ salary,,,whatever ;it might be’’,called.
Then some people, possibly of an ejefra 'Un-
appreciative ’■ or . crudcly-hostile; : sort, reckon
that £1 a day for expenses plas ;tl^)', 'Parlia-
mentary salary, that Was going on all the
time, would have been good value- for the
work done, so -far as that wprk >hasfapneared.
Of course, the proceedings of the McGowen
Government were quite legal. In fact., this
writer can find nqthing in the;,letter of the
law to ■prevent it sending Nielsen,’ or any
other member to Byrock with £lO a-day for
expenses to study 'the dust- problem for the
hidden cause of anthills. But the business
doesn’t look pleasant, and if the N.S.W.
Labor Government finds its tombstone over
this affair, there will be no great cause for
astonishment.
The Alleged Degenerates of England.
Thus Dr. Forbes Winslow, the eminent
mind specialist, in a recent deliverance on
England :
The mental condition of the people is most dis-
quieting. Degeneracy is alarmingly on the increase,
and crime is becoming markedly more prevalent.
And, after all, what else can be ex-
pected? There are now in England and
Wales (or there were over a year ago
—doubtless the number has increased)
619 persons to the square mile, the popu-
lation having almost doubled in 50 years.
This represents the greatest case of
crowding on earth save that of Saxony, and
if England is taken by itself it would, per-
haps equal Saxony. Overcrowding in itself
leads to degeneracy. The births in lull


numbered 897,100 —a considerable number
of them, as in all countries, and especially
in densely peopled ones, the progeny of
people who should never have been allowed
to marry. As a set-off to this, 302,722
people emigrated (this is still dealing with
the case of England and Wales alone), and
as these wanderers almost all went to places
which have a more or less rigid system of
inspection, they, whatever their drawbacks,
must have represented a fairly good sample
of the material available. That leaves an
alarmingly large proportion of the inferior
material to breed and multiply under loose
and casual laws. Almost every European
country has loose and casual laws on the
subject of marriage, but no other country,
save perhaps Italy, has England’s record for
emigration, and that has a material bearing
on the case. It is a matter of simple arith-
metic. If 300 people are born, of whom, as
a general thing, 25 are more or less unfit,
that makes 75 desirables to 25 undesirables.
But if 34 of the former emigrate (and they
have to at least pass desirables, to be
allowed to emigrate to any place worth going
to), that leaves only 41 desirables to 25 un-
desirables, and the proportions become
alarming in the present, and still more un-
promising in the future. There are four
special features in the case: (1) The emi-
gration from England and Wales has grown
steadily, till last year it reached a record
figure. (2) The system of examination has
grown more and more strict in the places
where most of these emigrants go to, there-
fore they probably now represent, more than
thev never did before, the pick of the nation.
(3) Despite all this emigration, those who
remain behind are more and more crowded,
which isn’t good for them. And (4) there
never before were so many philanthropic
agencies at work, struggling to keep the unfit
alive, so that they may reproduce their
species, and hand down their debilities and
misfortunes to future generations. So it is
hardly wonderful that the insane of England
and Wales are increasing much faster than
the population, and that the chest measure-
ment of the British soldier is a diminishing
quantity. In Scotland and Ireland there is
still room to breathe, and swing a cat, and
grow a chest. Scotland has 160 people to
the square mile and Ireland has 136. But
England and Wales, with 619 people to the
square mile (they had only 344 in 1861),
and especially England, which is much the
more densely peopled of the two, are ceasing
to be good places wherein to raise big, healthy
folk of the kind who take an heroic size in
waistcoats. When population is being
crowded out, and yet onlv the better speci-
mens are allowed to go, something must
happen to those who remain behind.
A Sanctuary for Crooks.
Last week there died, in Sydney, an old
gentleman by the name of Cook, who was
able to recall a mass meeting of the citizens
and a subsequent deputation to Governor
Fitzroy, with the object of protesting
against the despatch of more convicts to
N. S. Wales. The convicts are still arriving,
but instead of coming from England they
hail mostly from the United States. And,
nowadays, hardly anyone protests—not even
the police or the State Law authorities.
Over six months ago this paper drew atten-
tion to the fact that a Yankee criminal
named Bower had been sentenced to “five
years in Australia,” by a U.S. Judge, or
sludge, or something, for robbery with vio-
lence. His record, according to the San
Francisco papers, was a bad one —“gun
practice,” jffie local term for shooting with
intent to kill, being apparently an absolute
hobby of his. The boat on which Bower
left his native land, to begin the expiation
of his crimes in this country, was known to
the N. S. Wales authorities. He didn’t even
take refuge under an alihi. The way was
clear and easy for those whose duty it is to
handle such matters, to head off this emin-
ently undesirable immigrant, demand that
he should write a piece in Choctaw or Ro-
mance or some such bizarre tongue, and in
the likely event of his failing, bump him
back to the country which had the ill-fortune
to produce him, as provided for by. Aus-
tralia’s admirable Immigration Restriction
Act. That was the course which The Bul-
letin urged six months ago. The authori-
ties elected enthusiastically to do nothing.
As one result, Edward Ryan, an inoffensive
burgher of Rozelle, was last month violently
assaulted and robbed by Bower, his cash
loss being £25. Also, since the only means
of livelihood of persons of the Bower breed
is robbery and kindred enterprises, various
other citizens have possibly to thank official
remissness for the loss at his hands of their
property and mayhap their very lives. In
Ryan’s case he was caught, but how often
he did the deed and wasn’t caught it is im-
possible to say. When a private individual
omits to perform some obvious duty and
thereby causes serious financial or bodily
dhmage to another, the Law leaps on him
with no uncertain feet. Thus, one who was
injured, through falling into a publican’s cel-
lar, owing to the flap of the same being left
off, .would have a sound and extensive claim
against the. owner of the beer-vault. On the
same principle private individuals who are
subjected to painful assaults and pecuniary
losses because of the gross carelessness of
State officials in regard to matters within
their province, have an equitable right to re-
dress against the State —or, better still,
against these negligent officials in their pri-
vate capacitv. Edward. Ryan, the victim
of Bower, Yankee thug and robber, should
clrtainly get his £25 back from the law,
official who ought to have administered the
Act but didn’t, together with a solatium for
the physical and. mental and other damage
he has endured, .since none .of his misfortunes
would have occurred had the said official
taken the trouble to do those things which
he is there to do. This paper would vastly
like to see the above point raised in some
fdrm. or another, if only for the reason that
it might tend to coerce the police into grap-
pling with at least one feature of the exist-
ing crime-wave. According to Svdnev Tele-
graph (6/9/T2)
A gang of-notorious American “crooks” of various
degrees of lawlessness, is in Sydney, and its num-
bers are being augmented with the arrival of each
American liner.
Where is the sense' in a country admitting
nptorious “crooks” and such like undesir-
ables when it has an elaborate mass of legis-
lative machinery expressly constructed to
keep their sort out;
Bespattering a National Principle with
Party Mud.
A significant and unedifying business is
the insistence by the bitterer Tories of Aus-
tralia, and by the anti-Australian press, on
every conceivable item that is calculated to
cast discredit on the system of; compulsory
service. After the first few yelps of protest
the idea of compulsory “training” instead
of “service” was accepted with something
like enthusiasm. Gradually, however, it
seems to have dawned on certain party tac-
ticians that there was something to be done
in the way of an alliance between anti-
militarism and capitalism. A careful selec-
tion of professedly hard cases among the
cadets who are prosecuted for shirking drill
is being made. One of the latest was that of
a lad who said he had to keep, clothe, feed
and wash and possibly boil a family of
allegedly vast extent. It included, if this
writer remembers aright, six aged grand-
mothers and eight small brothers and sisters
under one year of age, together with droves
of bedridden uncles and aunts. Harassed
by his domestic duties he starkly refused to
drill; though one opines that friendly neigh-
bors would cheerfully have undertaken suffi-
cient baby-washing, etc., to have left him
free to attend to his military duties for
about li hours per week, had he been seri-
ously disposed to fulfil the same. The pathe-
tic plight of this virtuous youth was indus-
triously held up to public view in virulently
anti-Labor sheets. The magistrate almost
burst with misery in the act of imposing on
him a nominal fine. The recalcitrant child-
minder intimated his intention of going to
gaol sooner than pay the unjust impost, and
withdrew proudly in an atmosphere, as it were,
of suppressed cheers, and bowling his
halo in front of him as if it were
a hoop. For several days Toryism
kept him in a niche of the sort occupied
by the Drummers of the Fore and Aft, the
Deck who stood on the Burning Boy, and
other juvenile heroes. By these means, and
by innumerable hints and innuendoes regard-
ing the tyranny and futility and “un-Bri-
tish” (whatever that may mean) character
of the system under which they are called
upon to serve, Australia’s future defenders
are being encouraged to mutiny and ma-
ligner. In pursuance of what,looks like a
deliberate* plan of campaign Onslow.
M.L.A., for Waverley, recently abandoned
the local:;volunteer regiment in which he
held >a harmless commission that would feed
out of the hand. He put on much nup—the
thing that becomes'dog when it is grown
up ; and exnlained last week in Sydney, as
he lias explained with wearisome iteration
elsewhere, that he left: the service because
he considered his “sword” was “stained” by
association with the infamous compulsory
system. His sword may not have been
stained with blood on a dozen battlefields,
but such as it is Onslow will not see it
blotted by. political crime. Yet this bellow-
dramatic fustian is unlikelv to deceive the
discerning. If a Liberal Administration had
been responsible for Australia’s present Re-
fence system, it is a Dreadnought to a toy
rowing-boat that Onslow Would not have
considered that his hardware was polluted
by its connection with what he now calls
“conscription.” Similarly, if the Laborites
had not put the Defence Act on the Statute
Book, the papers which tried unavailingly to
prevent Labor putting any legislation on
any Statute Book, would not now be so
concerned to discredit the measure. In
brief, the whole agitation which is at pre-
sent in progress against compulsory service
is the outcome of our demented Party Gov-
ernment system. Politicians like Onslow
and partisan newspapers of the Sydney
Telegraph stamp think they see a chance
of pinking the enemy through the latter’s
defence legislation. That in so doing they
stand to emasculate the only defence system
Australia is ever likely to have (for whatever
the changes in detail the broad principle
that military service must be compulsory is
going to stand) does not perturb these
agonising patriots one iota. They are so
absorbed being loyal to their party that they
have no time to worry about loyalty to Aus-
tralia.

Art, Letters, the Drama and John Hop.
Dear Bulletin, —The other day a Sydney
paper announced with smug self-satisfaction
that: —
The police are maintaining a vigorous censorship
of all moving pictures exhibited at the numerous
shows now established in the city and suburbs. As
a result of their careful watching, and the speedy
investigation of representations made by citizens,
many decidedly undesirable presentations have been
prohibited by the Chief Secretary, and other pictures
have been improved by the elimination of objec-
tionable scenes.
Parenthetically, it should be explained that
the paper referred to is one which con-
sistently visualises the police as a body of
Admirable Crichtons who not only could do
no wrong, or make a mistake, but who would
never by any chance, or conspiracy of events,
or concatenation of circumstances, allow,
permit, countenance, or be cognisant of any-
body else doing anything wrong, or unusual,
or irregular! It is the paper which always
carefully prints the full name, degree and
status of every cop, slop or John Hop who
may be in the vicinity of any corpse-finding,
runaway, football match, funeral or motor-
car collision; the paper that always keeps
“heroic conduct,” “magnificent coolness,”
“admirable presence of mind,” and similar
gurgitative superlatives in type, and which
always applies them to the presence and con-
duct of the Force upon all conceivable —and
a vast number of inconceivable —occasions !
Now, what I want to know, is, Why the
police are to be made censors of picture—or
any other shows? Also, who made them so?
Is a policeman ex officio a competent judge
and critic of Art, Letters and the Draum ?
Is he, necessarily, able to distinguish Use-
majeste from common or garden treason,
ribaldry from blasphemy, or indecency from
suggestiveness? Has he the brains, educa-
tion, experience, tact and culture denied to
999,998 out of every million persons—-which
alone should constitute the qualifications for
censorship? Is he born with them, or are
they handed to him with his first uniform,
or what? Does Day or O’Callagiian con-
duct a special School of Criticism, which all
probationers attend and triumphantly emerge
from, stuffed with knowledge of codes, classi-
fications, technique, ethical distinctions, legal
dittos and moral dittos? Are these para-
gons of policemen prepared to condemn at
sight and prohibit the film of “Hamlet,” “La
Tosca” or “Pink Dominoes,” while passing
the film of “The Worst Christian in
Katoomba” or the “Passing of the Star
Boarder?” Because, if so—and apparently
it is so, very much so! —Australians have a
right to know why. If our police can safely
be accepted at their own valuation, or at the
valuation of the aforesaid Sydney journal,
why then we ought to hold a national
Policeman’s Day to adequately express our
bursting pride! Also, if (as we are assured)
our slops are so eminently capable and
worthy to act as cepsors of Letters, Art and
the Drama, their ,pay should be instantly
raised fourfold,ifijt' least. Otherwise, we are
degrading ourseßmh by sweating a Peerless
Body—or else (lie John Hops are philan-
thropists of the largest size. Other countries
pa v their Censors of Plays anywhere from
£B5O to £2OOO a year—and even then' the
censors don’t always give satisfaction, not
even to the newspapers! Our censors are
getting only a few paltry bob a day, and how
much of the genuine, informed, critical
faculty can you get for a few bob a day?
Outside of Australia, that is. Here, appar-
ently, we are getting it-—tons of it —but how
much longer is such under-payment to be
tolerated by this enlightened community?
We pay our censors of boxing a better figure
than the intellectuals in uniform who “guard
our morals” for us; because, perhaps, while
any ordinary constable is de facto a compe-
tent critic of Art, Letters and the Drama,
fight-critics must be at least sub-inspectors!
Hence it is, too, that the most “prohibitive”
Chief Secretary Australia ever had was a
house-painter by trade. Awaiting patiently
some authoritative assurance on these points.
—Yours, etc., Clarence O’llagan.

Smash!
Dear Bulletin, —Consider the latest Mel-
bourne horror how it happened !! A
train leaving Spencer-street, Melbourne, f6r
Coburg suburb travelled op the Williams-
town line for a short distance, but immedi-
ately after passing the signal-box at Frank-
lin-street. it turned to cross the line of “cou6-
try” rails: running midway between the
aforesaid Williamstown line and that?which
runs direct't.o. CobUrg. The train from Flem-
ingtbn Agricultural Show Ground travelled,
as the Flemington racecourse trains travel,
on the central line, and was coming into
town whilst the Coburg train was outgoing.
And’ just at the crossing points the two
engines met face to face. The train for
Coburg, it seems, was a few minutes behind
table time. Had it been a fhw more seconds
late' the- train from Flemi ngton would bnVe
cut into the middle of it instead of striking
the .engine, .Given the combination of cit-
eumstanees that led to this disaster —the
lateness of one or other train, and the dis-
regard of a'signal by, one or other driver, or
a failiire in the working of a signal—a more
or les§ horrible-accident wgsvery likely jite
occur. \Vhy do vtralns-for Coburg leiivo
Soqhger-stredt oti the ; Williamste>wn instead
of the Cdhurg and !-run w-hatiseems To
be a prep’psfefoiisly unnecessary rink in prov-
ing the . route of “country” trains? : Some
excuse for the workers“ concerned in this
accident is evident in tile statements pub-
lished next morning. We are told : “It is
the general practice for the Coburg train to
cross from the Williams town rails and over
the country rails to get on to the line for
Coburg.” For this dangerous general prac-
tice the Commissioners who sanction such
traffic management are responsible. Again:
“Show specials follow the same route as
Flemington race trains, running through
North Melbourne, as a rule, on the Essen-
don (or country) rails. On the up or home-
ward journey, especially during ‘rush’
suburban hours —that is to say, after 5
o’clock —-each special is passed along from
one section to the other with the greatest
caution.” The “rush” hours had not begun
when the accident occurred, so the greatest
caution would not be considered necessary.
But the fact that caution —small, medium or
great—is expected of train controllers at this
point is an admission of its dangerousness,
for which the Commissioners are responsible.
The question that occurs to every layman
critic is, “Why does the train for Coburg
start its journey on the direct line to Wil-
liamstown, seeing that the Essendon and
country lines (which, at Melbourne’s great-
est holiday times, are required for a rapid
service of special trains ) run between the
direct lines to Williamstown and Coburg
respectively?” The explanation, apparently,
is that the Railway-Commissioners were not
content to have the terminus of the northern
suburbs lines as of yore at Spencer-street
station (which is the terminus for the Flem-
ington show and race trains), but decided
to book Coburg passengers at Flinders-street
in order to establish direct competition with
the tramway service to that unfashionable
district. Possibly one result of last week’s
tragedy will be the abolition of the perilous
Coburg train service between the two metro-
politan stations. Passengers for Sydney or
any other big city have to book at
Spencer-street. Passengers from these places
are turned out at Spencer-street. What is
good enough for the inhabitants of Ballarat,
Bendigo, etc., ought to be good enough for
the denizens of Coburg or any other northern
suburb. Because there was a trifle more
money per annum to be made by starting
the Coburg trains on the Williamstown line
at Flinders-street, the Railway Commission-
ers have been unnecessarily jeopardising the
crowded special trains that run to and fro
Flemington on 30 days of the year, not to
mention the lesser risk that other trains on
the country line are exposed to by the cut-
across system. It is all very well for these
autocratic colleagues and officers of the de-
parted Tait to say: “The junction was pro-
perly locked. When the junction is locked,
and the signal given for one train to cross,
the conflicting signals are supposed to be
locked.... no system can provide entirely
against the possibility of error on the part
of railway officials,” etc., etc. In this case
there ought not to have been any junction,
or signals, or locking and unlocking. The
system was- rotten in that it provided the
signalmen and engine drivers with a possi-
bility of error. It was especially rotten in
that it created this danger to the special
trains that run crowded to and fro Fleming-
ton during many hours of many days in; the
year. The sin of running Coburg trains
across the country lines below Spencer-street
is a scarlet sin, and the Commissioners com-
mitted it. Not the engine drivers and signal-
men. As for the rottenness of the rolling
stock which is invariably used for Fleming-
ton specials—the stinking second-class tinder-
boxes which cost the public thrice the normal
first-class fare to ride in—the Commissioners
lack the impudence to offer any excuse. The
Commissioners can only shrug their shoul-
ders and say “Sorry” when a passenger is
found dead in a crumpled railway carriage
because it —the carriage, not the passenger—-
was about 25 years too old to stand the
shock of a collision. —Yours, etc., O.K.

The Weaklings,
“Henri Singemoine’s” letter: —
A glaring defect in the character of the McGowen
Ministry is its tendency to fraternise with, and on
occasion to humbly take advice from, the enemy.
The Ministry or man or other entity which habitu-
ally does this is bound to fall, especially where the
enemy is not exactly bursting with chivalry, and the
McGowen Administration has duly fallen in, not
once merely, but many times. Take its recent atti-
tude towards the Farmers and Settlers’ Association.
The F. and S. Assoc, is a frankly partisan body, com-
posed almost entirely of bovine hayseeds, in whose
eyes anyone professing Democratic principles 1 is on
the same plane with a dangerous malefactor. Yet,
the other day, Ministers gave the F. and S. confer-
ence a fictitious importance by attending its delib-
erations and speechifying at great length. Also,
they allowed Railway Commissioner Johnson to do
the same thing, and he showed his appreciation of
their idiocy by delivering a smart attack on
McGo\VEN-ism and all its works. Shortly after-
wards a Farmers and Settlers’ deputation called on
the Minister for Lands. On , this occasion, Beeby,
with unusual bluntness and horse-sense, requested his
visitors to cut out the political aspect of the Lands
question. (As Beeby and his Government stand immut-
ably for leasehold, and as the F and S. crowd had just
previously, by resolution, committed itself irrevo-
cably to freehold, the, reasonableness of the Minister’s
attitude is plain. Neither side could have convinced
the other on the broad nrinciple of the Lands ques-
tion, had argument raged for months; and it was
only business, therefore, to get, without purposeless
delay and. recrimination, to those subjects which
might produce some tangible results.) Beeby’s re-
ward for attempting to humor the absurd bucolics, in
the first instance, was an enraged attack in about 14
different quarters, and wild cries concerning Labor’s
oernicious habit, of “stifling free speech”—as though
it is a 'Minister’s duty to offer himself as a target for
all the verbal electioneering matter that his foes
feel like projecting at him.
The more recent attitude of the Ministry, in the
matter of Speaker Willis, is another example of the
same enfeebled tendency. Willis considered it ad-
visable, the other day, to fling the Sydnev Telegraph
out' of the N. S. Wales Assembly. It is not denied
anywhere that, in taking this step, Willis was within
his legal rights—as much within his rights as a bar-
man is who flings an objectionable citizen out of his
bar. Of course the usual old howl arose to the effect
that the Speaker’s action constituted the '“suppression
of. free speech.” The Telegraph actually had the
■nerve to tell its readers that Willis had caused it
“to be prevented from publishing the proceedings in
Parliament.” It is perhaps unnecessary to mention
that none- but a lunatic would swallow such com-
plaints as these 1 . Neither Willis nor anyone else
anticipated for a moment that the ejectment of the
Telegraph reporters would debar that paper’s readers
from getting precisely the same amount of Parlia-
mentary-news as they had been wont to achieve in the
past,. All that the treatment-meted out to the Tele-
graph amounted to, was a salutarv warning or grave,
public rebuke—the same sort, of penaltv that the
stewards at a well-conducted race meeting hand a;
jockey who is making trouble, by his refractoriness,
among the other lads. The Telegraph was solemnly
censured, and that, was really: all there was to it.
The question the’ McGowEN-ites ' might well have
debated before allowing themselves to be rushed by
Liberalism into a measure designed to “clip the
Speaker’s -wings;” as a Liberal sheet exultantly put
it, was: Had Willis reasonable justification for the
step he took? In this writer's opinion he had.
Uncle.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
London, Friday.—Professor G. Elliott Smith —a
graduate of Sydney Universitj', and now professor of
anatomy at the University of Manchester-—read a
paper before the anthropological section of the
British Association on the “Evolution of Man.” 'He
regards the orang-outang, the chimpanzee, and the
gorilla, not as ancestral forms of man, but as unen-
terprising members of man’s family. “They are
simply men,” the Professor argues, “whose . ancestors
chose physical strength rather than intelligence as
their means of livelihood.”- — Cable.
“The time is not yet ripe, ” he said,
And leaped upon a i, , gh.
Our tailed and hairy father fled
Upon the ground to seek his bread.
And where is Uncle now?
Some twenty thousand years ago,
Two hairy apes fell out;
The first was quick, the second slow;
To ev’rything he chattered “NO !”
And rolled his head about.
His head sloped backward from his brows:
Each arm was like a flail;
He liked destruction, sloth and rows,
And did his thinking in the boughs
While swinging by his tail.
He would not trust himself upon
The flat and treeless ground ;
His red eyqs in their sockets shone
When down the trunk his twin had gone.
And run off like a hound.
That was the parting of the ways;
It happened up a tree
In dim and unrecorded days ;
But lie who at the turnstile pays
Our Uncle still can see.
He glares behind the iron bars,
And cracks nuts with his jaws ;
Our self-respect it slightly jars
To think our ancestry he tars
With grimy, apish paws.
But, sad to say, he did not stay
Completely up his tree;
Long after Pa had gone away
His grandson, on a valiant day,
Came down the earth to see.
A thousand years or so behind,
He followed Father’s track;
And ever on the scornful wind
The voice of him with terror blind
Rang out: “Come hack! Come hack!”
He hobbled on from age to age,
Too frightened to return;
He went in horror stage by stage—
A coward slinking in a rage
To some mysterious bourne.
He altered as he went along;
His hair began to fail;
His mighty limbs were not so strong,
And something else he felt was wrong....
Alas! Where was his tail?
When he caught up, he sought a bough
Whereto his feet might cling;
And, as men know, he has it now.
(The Upper House, you will allow,.
Now holds this ancient thing.)
“The time is not yet ripe!” Of course.!
He fears that he will" fall!
Still down the ages, mad and hoarse,
It sounds with undiminished force-
The ling’ring ape’s recall! .

WHERE
EVERYBODY
GOES
It is just a year now since he embarked on the
stupendous job of altering one of the most disorderly,
inebriated and blasphemous of Assemblies into a de-
cently-behaved institution. Changes of that magni-
tude take a deal of accomplishing, even under the
most ideal conditions. Willis, in his efforts at re-
form, has been hampered consistently by that section
of the press which usually refers to itself as “re-
sponsible.” The Liberals in the N. S. Wales Parlia-
ment have answered automatically to whatever
promptings in the direction of violence and outrage
they received from their party newspapers. They
were informed, bn the day previous to Willis’s elec-
tion, that “of all the tempests that have swept
through the Legislative halls of the State, none will
equal the one Mr. Willis will face when he presents
himself,” etc., etc. Of course there was a riot, and
Willis had things thrown at him, and narrowly
escaped personal injury; just as there would be a
riot in a street or pub mainly frequented by Liberals,
if, in similar circumstances, someone got up on a
stump and mentioned that Willis was coming, and
that trouble was inevitable, and hinted that if, unfor-
tunately, the approaching traitor was torn to pieces,
it would be, after all, something of a boon to the
State. The morning after the uproar in the Assem-
bly, the Telegraph remarked complacently that the
whole affair was “humanly inevitable,” and on those
lines it has proceeded ever since.
The Telegraph has lately been making use of pre-
cisely the same incitements to Parliamentary violence
(no less effective from the fact that they were covert
and wary) as it?employed to such good purpose last
year. The moth disreputable spirits in the House
were getting busy in the desired direction, accord-
ingly. Willis was offered the choice between mak-
ing an example of the real offender, and letting the
Assembly drift back into the condition of chaos and
anarchy that characterised it before he took charge.
He made a bold move, and the journal which has all
along done most to foment strife went out briskly on
its ear. No Government which favors the mainten-
ance of law and order in the Assembly should have
objected to that occurrence, and what the McGowen-
ites were doing in the same galley with the Liberal
press in the matter is a mystery. To the writer it
appeals as yet another lamentable example of their
inability, as a party, to appreciate the right time
to turn starkly on the enemy and tell him to go to
Hades with his bogus and intelligence-insulting
grievances.

From the business paper of the House of
Reps:—
Mr. Bamford : To" move. .. .when any article or
paragraph appears in a newspaper reflecting upon
the. good conduct or integrity of a member which,
in the opinion of the said member, is calculated to
prejudice him in the eyes of the community, and the
member affected, by personal explanation or other-
wise, declares that the statements so made in regard
to himself are '.erroneous, misleading and injurious,
and the House in good faith accepts such statement,
no representative or representatives of the newspaper
implicated be allowed within the precincts of Parlia-
ment House unless, or until, the explanation or con-
tradiction made by the aggrieved member be given
in the aforesaid newspaper prominence equal to that
given to the offending article or paragraph.
And what about two more provisoes: (1)
That there must not be a three-column ex-
planation in reply to a three-line paragraph;
and. (2) that the reply must not be any
more dreary or less readable than the asper-
sion? Every editor will speak feelingly on
the first point, anyhow. Many an aggrieved
individual with a weak case sends a tankful
of MS. in reply to a charge that is no bigger
than tuppence, and when it simply can't get
in he explains to his friends that a c’rupt
press shut out his overwhelming refutation
because if it * had been published it would
have covered the Archimedean lever with
shame.
“F.C.,” from Melbourne :
We were coming back from the Show, and had got
clear of Flemirigton, and were running at an easy
pace down to Spencer-street. Behind was tne Hur-
ried day, with its dust and wind; before us the
evening meal, the fireside, or the theatre. The
compartment was comfortably filled, and conversa-
tion ran lightly round. All at once there was a
jerk, rather a violent jerk, and those facing the
engine were pitched head-first into those opposite.
While we were struggling, with just a dim feeling
of fear or doubt, there came a horrible, rasping,
tearing sound, as of some giant hitting a streetful
of wooden houses with an axe. Shivered glass flew
against our faces, the partition behind us ripped and
cracked, as we came to a dead stop—in perhaps 10
seconds. Then, for just as long as one could supnort
it, a deathly stillness—a silence of helpless fear.
After that, moans and screams, a wild scramble
through doors and windows, where possible. Many,
as they got out, though quite unhurt, ran 20 or 30
yards away from the wrecked train before they
stopped. Some sat down, their heads in their hands.
Others felt themselves, as though to be sure there
wasn’t a leg or arm missing. They went back and
looked at the wreck, shuddering. Help there was;
plenty. In less than an hour the last sufferer was
safely bandaged up in hospital. But few of the
survivors gave any help. They couldn’t. They
could hardly think or talk sanely till they got over
the memory of that ripning, smashing noise and the
awful silence that followed it. But for two of us
there was no fear, or pain, or suffering—nor any to-
morrow.
A certain Professor Smith, once of
N.S.W., and now of Manchester, in Grime-
land, has propounded an interesting theory
about the large apes. An old idea -was that
man descended from them, and that the
present apes are certain superfluous material
that remained —in other tvords, that a suffi-
ciency of ape was used up to make all the
man that -was required, and there Avas a cer-
tain amount of ape over Avhich never changed
or varied. Smith’s view is that the ape
really is man-—that he represents a branch
of the family which chose to develop its
muscles rather than its brains, anu owing to
the fact that the two sections stuck each to
its special line, progress caused a wide, con-
spicuous divergence to set in. The process of
separation began very early. When Adam
sat in his office in Cain-street, Genesis,
devising the first wild cat, he looked through
the window and saw his brother Mandril
coal-heaving on the wharf. So profound
thought ran in one family, and profound
coal-heaving in the other. But at last man
invented machinery and appliances and com-
plications, and lie found that they were
cheaper than his hulking, hairy, idiot rela-
tive, and, besides, the hairy relative was too
clumsy, and broke the machinery. So, as
the natural reward for long service, the sons
of Adam gave the sack to the children of
Mandril, and told them that they would be
shot if they w<?re seen about the' place, and
the children of Mandril fled without their
back salary, and took to the woods. Thus
did thfei gorilla differentiate himself from
the counterjumper, and they remain unlike
to this day—especially in the matters of
tight boots, hair oil qnd affability.

“Passers-by,” a new play by Haddon
Chambers, was produced last week at Syd-
ney Royal. Like so many modern dramas
of British origin, it features one of the 12J
millions of unemployables with whom the
United Kingdom is understood to be afflicted.
Samuel Burns, when urged to work, objects
feebly that the thing is impossible, work
being “for workmen.” He has never had an
opportunity to learn the art, and does not
wish to, any more than he desires to wash or
shave. He drifts into the piece, off the rain-
swept streets, at an early stage, and at the
finish drifts back whence he came to resume
the frozen hell on earth which is his life.
Even that sturdy optimist, the dramatist,
does not attempt to adumbrate a happy fin-
ish for Samuel. He is simply indicated
hopelessly, like some dreadful oleograph in
a gallery of old masters, and then an effort
is made, as it were, to forget him, and be
cheerful again. Which is strikingly illus-
trative of the way society at large, in the
Cold Country, treats the simmering volcano
that is forever being fed by persons of the
Burns stamp. With the exception of the
social misfit, who has no real connection
with the action of the play, the characterisa-
tion is commonplace and unconvincing. Pine,
the intolerantly conservative man-servant, is
employed to throw up, in high relief, on the
one hand the splendid broad-mindedness of
his superiors, as regards the lower orders,
and. on the other, the squalid and uncivilised
habits of the submerged. He is but a faint
shadow of a human being. The time is
surely ripe • for the death and burial of the
ancient convention which insists that all
stage servitors shall be the lineal descendants
of Thackeray’s incredible Jeames von Yel-
lowplush. There may be thoughtful, philo-
sophic, poverty-stricken, intellectual and
withal contented and humble old cabmen
such as Nighty in London. However, the
writer, as the outcome of years of experi-
ence of this class, makes hold to doubt it.
Nighty is another conventional stage figure
of the mendacious order.
“PASSERS-BY," AT SYDNEY ROYAL.
Harcourt Beatty as Peter George Miller as
Waverton. “Nighty" the Cabman.
The plot is simple, and with the addition
of a few grains of credulity, may be swal-
lowed by any carper. Peter Waverton
“wrongs” his step-sister’s governess. The
distracted girl flees in disorder into the vasty
unknown of business life, and Peter, though
he tries desperately, is unable to find her —
London, as it is explained shrewdly, being
.“a large place.” So he gets engaged after
seven years, to another. The wronged lady
comes and coughs violently on his doorstep
by night. She does not know it is his door-
step, though he is a figure in society, and
though she has never ceased to adore him.
She merely recognises that it is a doorstep.
He brings her in, and learns for the first
time that he has a son. After a certain
amount of sentimental-by-play, the girl to
whom he is engaged gives him up with a
sportsmanlike goodwill that borders on the
hilarious, and he clasps the faithful ex-
governess to his errant chest.
* * ? *
Harcourt Beatty grapples valiantly with
the trying role of Waverton. He does well in
the emotional scenes, but so far as creating
the desired atmosphere is concerned, he fails.
As this paper has remarked before, Beatty’s
striking mannerisms handicap him in the
portrayal of a modern young man of fashion.
The flashing eye, the convulsive workings of
the brow, the lip writhing in scorn —all of
which are brought into action on the scan-
tiest provocation—would be received with
stupefaction and stern disapproval at (say)
the Bachelors’ or White’s. They might go
well enough at the Green Room Club or the
Savage, but then the Waverton type rarely
visits such resorts. Miss Hilda Spong’s rep-
resentation of the governess is full of quiet
charm and pathos. Some fine character-act-
ing is done by Robert White, George Miller
and A. J. Patrick ; and Miss Bessie Major
and Miss Dorothy Cumming are altogether
admirable.
* * * *
When a bogus company promoter finds
such an easy proposition as Battlesburg, he
is not likely to leave the place till he has
got every dollar in the till; and J. Rufus
Wallingford shows no .(signs >df departing
from Sydney Criterion for months yet. He
must have made some hundred millions of
dollars out of his covered carpet tacks since
his arrival in Australia.

The Bulletin is disappointed. It was
promised “sensations in spasms” and “whirl-
winds of surprises” at “Her Forbidden Mar-
riage,” at the Adelphi, on Saturday; but
during the whole five acts there wasn’t one
sensation which could lawfully be accused of
being, a “spasm”; and the “whirlwinds of
surprises” all subsided to gentle breezes of
expectations. The plot is the old, weather-
worn one of the villainous gent, who wishes
to marry a wealthy girl, s who doesn’t want
him, and, with the necessary melodramatic
complications, marries someone else. Then
all would have been satisfactory, and the
audience could have gone home, but the vil-
lain decided to have another attempt, and
contrived to dump the hero —the girl’s hus-
band—into gaol, and proceeded to become a
nuisance. But just as he had almost suc-
ceeded in being a profound bore, the hero
escaped from gaol and—then the “house”
went home. There is for about 2| hours
out of three a very noticeable superabund-
ance of “funny man,” and writer recommends
a generous use of shears—or, if there are
no shears handy, cannon would do, or a
crocodile, or a mad elephant, or poison, or
Judgment Day—to exterminate about 98 per
cent, of him. The other 2 per cent, might
be stunned. Hugh Buckler is a big
success as the inventor-hero, and brings down
the house, in his argument with his rich boss
by exclaiming, “Well, it’s Labor against
Capital, and, take, my word, Labor will win,”
which it does. Violet Paget gaits the entire
sympathy of the house as the wealthy maiden
aforesaid. The treachery is divided among
three: Jennie Pollock, as the second wife of
Sir George Lancaster; Godfrey Cass, the
villain’s understudy; and Charles Lawrence,
the villain proper, who allows himself to be
flouted, time and again by the stipendiary
humorist. Each is remanded for sentence.
Elwyn Hervey, as servant in the house of
Lancaster, does nothing in particular, but
does it well.

When the English mail is a day or so late,
the supply of films for the Sydney picture
shows doesn’t come to hand to time, so the
shows have to get along as well as they can
under the circumstances. And that means
that they have to make a choice from their
old stock. Thus, on Monday, the J. D. Wil-
liams co. couldn’t stick to its promises,
though for the rest of the week the original
programme will be followed. All the same,
on Monday each of the four Sydney theatres
had a very good series to unroll. The second
edition of the Crystal Palace is still proving a
big draw. The machines are changed each
fortnight, so there is always something new.
Neptuna, the young American swimmer, who
is putting in a season in a glass tank, is still
drawing well.

At the National Amphitheatre one Hugh
Huxham is presenting a band of serenaders.
They are habited as Pierrots, but in other
respects are the same old Serenaders that the
world has known from the days of Old Cas-
tile down to those of Manly Beach. Gilbert
Lauri’s turn, “In 1950,” is amusing, and Roy
Redgrave and Mab Paul appear in a cheerful
playlet. For the rest, the Olracs, Victoria
Cross, and Mabel and Malfe continue to
decorate the bill.

The Tivoli bill had nothing fresh to say
last week-end. The balancing Schenck
Brothers were mentioned with pride, and
Minnie Kaufmann, trick cyclist, was referred
to with arrogance. Juggler Chinko was
trumpeted loudly as “wonderful.” and Rich
and Rich were hurried to the footlights as
“real racy comedians.” Then the jolly
Sprightly girls were confidently presented
and the public were called upon to admire
Jessie Stuart’s voice. But, after all, the fact
remained that none of these performers were
quite new, and the novelty which is the spice
of entertainment was lacking.
“The Girl from Wayback” is still holding
the frying-pan up to Nature at the Palace,
and shows no disposition to cease. The
managerial advertisement speaks very-highly
of her, and asserts that the season is boom-
ing. The loud, gong-like note of a falling
frying-pan will probably not be heard until
the indignant voice of the next show is raised
in argument at the stage door.
The “Nightbirds” fly from Her Majesty’s
(Sydney) on Friday evening. Next night
(Saturday) “The Chocolate Soldier” returns,
and storms the Pitt-street roost as gallantly
as any farmburner, for the sake of the
golden eggs laid in the pay box by the cack-
ling public.

Simonides.
At Adelaide Royal, the Anderson co. has
turned from the romance of the Beggar-
Maid Princess, which, though steep, not to
say perpendicular or even overhanging, was
credible, to that of the telephone-wire' and
the faked idol, which aren’t. The title,
“When London Sleeps,” is conscientiously
altered to suit one lurid third-act scene,
“While decent London Sleeps.” The vari-
ety houses have wisely strengthened their
programmes on the showy or athletic side.
The three Alginas are back at the Tivoli, and
Vivian and Alton continue to assault and
batter each other. The musical side is very
strong, too. At the King’s, Marguerite and
the Hanleys are back, and several American
mixed pairs exchange amusing insults.
Wirths’ circus has just established itself at
the old Exhibition for Show week, which
promises to be a lively period. The dhief
picture houses are strongly dramatic —apart
from their reproduction of Wattle Day and
other local scenes: West’s with the Zenda-
like drama, “The Black Chancellor”; the
Empire with “Comrades in Arms,” or the
two enemies who stop shooting each other
to shoot jointly at savages ; and Wonder-
graph with the spy-and-fetters thriller,
“Saved from Siberia.” The last-named
house has also been showing the adventures
of an escaped panther, who proved a far
better low comedian than most humans who
haunt the filmy stage at present.
At Melbourne Princess’s, where seasons
come and go like shadows on the sands of
time, a revival of “A Girl’s Temptation” is
promised by the Marloughby management
for Saturday next. And one week of that
alleged record-buster will close the present
season, it is said. Meanwhile, .“Brought to
Ruin” continues to carry the ill-fated Baby
of the girl who fell from the washtub to
become the victim of an eminent Iv.C. The
authoress, of which sad sweet story is the
same British matron who committed the
bellowdrama which .will ensue on Saturday.
It seems . about time for an Australian
woman-writer to steep her pen in impro-
priety and scribble off a four-act play en-
titled “A Flapper’s' Folly, or How Bella
Won the Bonus.”
** * *
Also, the Bijou will change its bill next
Saturday. “The World, The Flesh and The
Devil” is the reigning attraction, but it
doesn’t call for the services of a packer on
the. staff. Hence an Announcement Extra-
ordinary of “The Magnificent Liar,” which,
on the word of the advt., has been secured
at enormous cost.
For one. more night Hugard, the Human
Target, will keep the good old flag of Wiz-
ardry flying at Melbourne Athenaeum Hall.
Ilugard is the audacious deceiver who pro-
fesses to. expand his breast to catch the
ball-cartridge,, and a bloodthirsty populace
is. rolling up in the Amin hope that a bullet
will lodge in the magician’s meat instead
of falling harmless on his dish.
A few remarks upon the Arion Society’s
production of “Merrie England” at the
King’s can stand over for a week. The first
performance of Edward German’s “straight”
opera happened last Monday, and its charit-
able mission will be completed to-morrow
(Friday). On Saturday the Bert Bailey

Flappers spent some tearful moments at
West’s Palace, Melbourne, on Saturday, when
“At the Last Moment” was given a run.
The film hails from Berlin or thereabouts,
and contains about half a mile of hugger-
mugger ending in yards of death-bed a la
Mimi and Camille. A large piece of Turk-
ish mystery was “The Three Sultanas,” a
Pathe colored picture of a bad old Sultan
who, after long and expensive polygamy, is
gradually convinced that one wife is better
than 9S, and talks less, and wears fewer
clothes. “Their Golden Anniversary” flick-
ergraphed a dear old story that attracted the
multitude; and “The Spirit Awakened” re-
counted the tale of a good, Kerristian youth
who paid off a mortgage by self-denial and
prayer—partly one and partly the other,
but chiefly" both.

During Show week bloated audiences, com-
posed largely of the country’s backbone and
bo ness, filled Melbourne Royal, where “Ben

bellowdrammer steeped in the odor of sanc-
tity. The story of the Semitic youth who
upset a piece of parapet on the gaud Mayor
of Jerusalem, and was arrested by the Roman
fire brigade_ on a charge of bigamy for the
sake of the insurance, is followed with a fair
amount of interest, considering its scrappy
and spasmodic nature. Although dull during
its lapses into theatrical piety, the drama is
not lacking in human interest. Some of this

Now is the ninth week of “The Quaker
Birl at Her Majesty’s, Melbourne. Last
ume this paper looked in to inquire about
its health the co. that had been more or less
successful on the first night of the campaign
was frivolling exactly as before. The audi-
ence, too, laughed at the same jokes which
were received with general cacchination when
the season was young. Success, in these
matters, runs in a circular groove, whilst
I ather Time ticks off each lap on his slate
and rings his bell for the final.

A number of the very naicest amateurs
have conspired to act on behalf of the
M omens Hospital at Her Melbourne Mai
next Saturday afternoon. Or, perhans thev
conspired to seize upon the hospitX’as an
excuse for their dramatic action. Anyhow
they are going to play “The Cassilis Engage-
ment, a comedy from which characters of
a -low order are rigidly excluded.

Among the swag of pictures at the Prah-
ran Lyric (Vic.) last Saturday evening, was
“The Turning Point,” a sermon for husbands
who lead the tight life and spend a lot of
their nights apart from their wives. In the
picture the young wife teaches her lord a
lesson by ipeans of a bogus note and a tear-
ful baby, and he promises to reform and go in
for early bed for the rest of his mixed
career. “Love’s Test” gave precious moral
tableaux of two young people who regard
true love as more important than a moun-
tain of dollars. In the end, of course, they
get both. That is the way things go in
books and dramas and films. In real life
people give up dollars for love, and the love
goes, while the dollars stay away. Time
rolls on, and the miserable desire for the
plunks gets the young couple down. They
revile each other because they sacrificed the
rocks for a shadow. They see the splosh in
their dreams, and the brass in their waking
hours. They grow slovenly and prematurely
middle-aged, and take to living in cheap
boarding-houses, and breakfasting in bed, and
drift into scandal and curl-papers and faded
wrappers and red noses. In fact, they find
life extremely flat, like salt that has lost its
savor, and when they think of their early
romance they would fain kick it all round
the backyard, but the lack of a commodious
backyard in a hash tower makes that impos-
sible.
Premier Peake says his Government in-
tends to complete Adelaide Parliament
House, so that it may stand as a monument
in marble of a fixed determination to uphold
State independence and State Frights. He
has since stated that instead of building the
new wing in solid marble, like the old part,
the Government will merely face the walls
vAh a veneer of marble “to save expense.’’
So the monument of State. Frights is to be
a whited sepulchre—ra pine circumstance
with a cheap veneer—a lady with a painted
face —a tlfing that is granite and Queen
Anne in front, and lath-and-plaster and ash-
barrel and Mary Ann behind.
“Galleryman” says:—
Last week, > in Melbourne Divorce Court, a plasterer
named John JThomas Smith asked for a divorce from
his wife on the ground of desertion. The wife, who
was 29 last birthday, lived with her husband only
five days, smoked, used hostile expressions and stayed
out at night. When Smith married he was a
widower, with seven children, and the unblushing
bride was a widow with none. Mrs. Smith delivered
a short address to the household before she finally
left. It was this: “To Hades with the lot of you!’’
Counsel for said they had “scoured the
country” for! respondent, without coming up with
that swift lady. The name of this lawyer, who per-
haps joined >nn the chase, was Woolf. The five-day
wife was giyen another chance to get a husband,
which seems, rough on the possible husband. I hold
that she should have been disqualified, and struck off
the roll and her certificate suspended.
“Mr. Ocky”: C. L. Forrest, Victorian ex-
M.L.A., who shuffled off this mortal coil a
few days ago, after haying reached the 74tli
timestone, was in Parliament as member for
Polwarth almost continuously from 1886 to
1911, when he gave it best and made a halt
to consider the state of his health. He was
rather a strange individual —a big Scotch-
man, who said little and smoked a great
deal. Indeed, I have never seen him without
a cigar. He was not much of a politician,
but he was generous and honest. Forrest
never once delivered a real speech in the
House. As an early settler he had some
rough experiences, and, of course, was in the
gold rushes (some of the stones for the
Eureka stockade were taken from his
claim). Forrest (Vic.) is named after him.
It is his only child.
The jubilee of McDouall Stuart’s trans-
continental march was celebrated only just
in time. Whatever a man’s constitution may
be, half a fcentury after he has done any big
work may find him pretty much on the edge
of things. Adelaide banqueted the survivors
of Stuart’s ’party on July 26; and on Sep-
tember 2 the besl known among them was
dead. Pat Auld Was not only with Stuart,
but also with Finniss when the first capital
°f the Northern Territory was selected at
the mouth of the Adelaide River. After-
wards he did very well for himself with the
Auldana vineyard and in a wine and spirit
business in Adelaide. Pie was a prominent
amateur actor and huntsman, and when he
got elderly it was one of the sights of the
local hunt to see him dismount, climb a
fence, and then call his pony, which jumped
over after him. George Auld, the well-
known rowing man, is his son.

AT POVERTY POINT.
“Stargazer”: It is false pretences to call “Ben
Hur” a play; it being merely a procession of events
with colored illustrations. It is a pieture'.film drajrta-
tised. You jump from one chromatic happening to
another, and the dialogue in between is of little
consequence. It is often allowed to become ex-
tremely dull, when preparations for the next climax
are somewhat delayed, and it is always superfluous.
With the present staging, “Ben Hur” might as well
be a dumb show. In fact, its interest would be
considerably increased if every performer were smitten
speechless at 8 p.m. There is not an incident in it
that needs to be told, which remark the gifted man-
agement may take as inferring that the action is
very “telling.”
Last week the industrious Miss Margaret Basker-
ville made a spread of her artistic goods at her
studio in Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, and a few
people mottled her show with the small red wafer of
commendation. The display contained the usual
platitudinous studies of fruit and flowers and one or
two figure subjects for the sensitive eye to ache about.
And it was interesting in including Bft'. of the late
Tummy Bent in clay, the object being a model for
the ultimate casting of that deceased hustler in
bronze. Bent, as Miss Baskerville sees him, looks
like an ex chef-d’oeuvre in human architecture. A
head that is a fairly passable likeness of Tom sits
nobly, rather than bull-neckedly, on a figure clothed
in a perfect frock-coat and unimpeachable pants.
The right hand clasps the usual rolled document, the
left is outstretched in conventional affability, and
the whole pose of the thing expresses; the dignity of
a picture in the Tailor and Cutter. But where
Miss B. has been most idealistic is in giving Tommy
a front of elegant contour. In life Bent had a pro-
vision department that sagged most obtrusively. But
his' sculptress has shored up his bingey by lining
the interior with the woodwork of a barrel (stuffed
with oddments), and has obtained 'an embonpoint
that is something more than a picture.' It is almost
a poem. Posterity will get a beautifully incorrect
notion of Thomas Adolphus Bent from his bronze
memorial at Brighton.
“Floater”: Gregan McMahon talks of giving Mel-
bourne more Shaw during his next Repertory season.
“Man and Superman” is foreshadowed, provided
McMahon can find a means of presenting Shaw’s
glacial hell and other scenic effects —including a full-
sized motor-car—on the limited of the Athen-
aeum Hall. Also, there is a possibility of the newer,
and considerably heavier, “Getting Starried,” being
submitted to Gregan’s patrons. Aljl will depend,
however, on the sweet reasonableness of one or two
players who want to be the entire show, whatever it
-is, including hell and the backcloth and the foot-
lights. They were given fat parts in the past, with
the result that the fat has gone to the top part of
them.
The amende honorable, or some such ceremony,
was made recently by a soulful-looking artist of the
Kirkby Lunn Company, who had been motored to
Healesville in order that he might inhale the wattle
perfume while drinking in Australian scenery. Dur-
ing luncheon he was introduced to a bunch of mis-
chievous girls, and rapidly found his limited stock
of v Ze Englis’ was being worked overtime. Pre-
sently the climax arrived in the shape of a query as
to his opinion of the Australian girls. With upturned
eyes, he declared they were the “most vol-wp-tuous”
he-had ever seen. A male friend whispered that this
could hardly be regarded as complimentarv, and the
visitor hastily explained that he understood the term
meant, “beaii-ti-ful,” adding, with great earnestness
that, if he had “offended m’amselle, he was b
sorry. He accentuated the Great Australian Adjec-
tive with charming empressement.
London Gaiety Theatre has just lost its Hibernian
housekeeper, Mrs. Tierney, aetat. 80. She was George
Edwardes s nurse. All the gaiety girls, from Nellie
barren downwards, knew her. The most notable feat
?rTT he L, lfe Consisted in turning the late Edward
VII. (then Prince of Wales) out of the Royal retir-
ing room at the Gaiety. She mistook him for a
waiter, or a dustman, or something.
A few Victorians of emerald hue have received
warning from Dublin of an “All Irish Show,” which
is, to _open in Melbourne before Cup time, and tour
therefrom. Mainly it will be a cinematograph picture
exhibition of modern matters and ancient monuments
m the land that is preparing to celebrate Home Rule.
Ine pictures include a “selected colored series of
Irish round towers, crosses, Celtic doorways, abbeys ”
and antiquities in general. A concert company will
deal only with Irish music and ballads. Other
national features of the show are hinted at, but not
particularised. Evidently the idea is to strike the
Home Rule spirit in Australia at boiling point, with
a show which will be interesting and educational

The alleged salaries of not a few music-hall per-
formers must be swallowed with salt; still,., the
wages paid to the top-notehers are amazing. ' The’ Bir-
mingham Theatre Royal Co. has just recoverei!U£ ! sso
and costs from an insurance co. It secured Wilkie
Bard for its Christmas pantomime, and insured
against the risk of his non-appearance through ill-
health for £5O for each performance at which he
failed to transpire. He was attacked by quinzy and
missed 11 performances. It came' out in evidence
that Wilkie’s contract with the theatre provided for
eight performances per week, at a salary of £225.
But it is. a case of making hay between showers, and
England is a wet climate. Wilkie is just now at
the top of the tree, but he may be an extra turn at
a guinea a night ere long, and after that he may be
a scene-shifter.
Oswald Stoll, the Melbourne-born rusher who runs
the London Coliseum and a score of other variety
theatres of less renown, has issued a proclamation
against the Sunday opening of the picture palaces.
He is not keen upon the opening of the regular
theatres and music-halls on Sundays, preferring to
spend the Sabbath in his library or his garden
(Oswald is something by way of being a semblance
of an author), but he believes in fair play all round.
A million people, he says, pay for admission to the
picture palaces every Sunday, and, the amusement
fund in their pockets is depleted to that extent, to
the detriment of the theatres and the music-halls
that are not allowed to open. That state of things,
he contends, is not cricket. It is hitting the drama
below the belt, and amounts to a kick in the
stomach. Nominally the Sunday receipts at the
picture palaces go to charities, but that is a mere
blind. Out of £60,000 taken at the London picture
palaces on Sundays during a given period, only
£6OOO went to charities, and charities were very
lucky to get that much.
J. M. Barrie is not a hustler in the matter of
play-writing. He takes his time, and that is why
his work is always so neat and polished. Four years
have passed since a new full-sized play from his pen
was produced in London, but now we have the defi-
nite promise of one ere long. Charles Frohman
announces that he will present a ' three-act drama,
by Barrie, in February. Frohman is also having a play
specially written by that old Sydney boy, Haddon
Chambers, who, he adds, “is now living in a little
riverside cottage, in order to concentrate his attention
on the work.” Frohman says Chambers’s new piece
will be “of somewhat stronger texture than ‘Passers-
By, although the comedy element will predominate.”
“Hullo”: Pleased to learn that ip New York meio-
drama has died of poor circulation and the failure of
box-office receipts. According to a recent book,
moving pictures struck the death blow. Only seven
theatres in New York were presenting melodrama in
1905. Now three are devoted to the film, two to
“H, e . s 0 ue > one to vaudeville, and one to drama in
Yiddish.

Eric Maxon, as the hero in “Ben Hur,” does most
of his love-making in armor, with the result that
Miss Dorothy Dix, who is appearing as Esther, sus-
tains many severe bumps and abrasions from contact
with the metal. —News item.
Sweet Esther has a dinted nose,
A scratch or two upon her chin,
Upon her head two bumps repose,
Her pretty ear is twisted in.
These towers of blood and iron, no doubt,
Are excellent in war, but when
The game is love, the kind of men
Who’re in demand are soft and stout,
With not a trace of iro-n about.
Ben Hur involves in metal holts
The daughter of Simonides,
He jabs her cheek against his bolts,
His gauntlet gives her hand a squeeze,
And breaks a nail. His buckles hurt,
lie hugs her to his steely breast.
Imprints upon her lip his crest,
The gods no sympathy assert
For Benno’s mangled bit of skirt.
Upon the stage chain-males are not
In hot demand as lovers now,
For Esther has a little lot
Of damages upon her brow,
Where gorget rough and visor ill
Have scraped and bruised the surface oft.
In Love's canoodling sweet and soft.
Poor lass, she feels that she is still
Enamored of a rolling mill!

Adelaide hotelkeepers are not likely to
follow Sydney’s lead in abolishing the coun-
ter-lunch. They mostly lay it out from 11
till 12 only—having one o’clock dinners com-
ing on —and find it no great expense, though
a good deal of trouble. But the chief point
is (as they tell the Adelaide dailies) that
the unemployed, or “Domain loafer,” is
practically unknown in that city, and nobody
wants to make a meal off the “snack.”

An Anglican church, costing about £5OO,
has just been built at Lismore, near Cam-
perdown (Vic.), and in the published list of
donations to the building fund there appears :
“Society for the Propagation of Christian
Knowledge (London), £25.” This is a
British society that exists to. spread the
gospel among the heathen. Lismore is .in
the heart of the Western District, which
is one of the most fertile sections of the
Commonwealth. It is the home of the
squatter, and swarms with motor-cars. Yet,
to build a little wooden church, it goes cap
in hand to Bull for a subscription. Is it
any wonder that a large section of Bull-
Land regards us as uncivilised? It is pretty
certain that the subscribers to the S.P.C.K.
think that their money is spent for the
spreading of Good Tidings amongst the
blacks, and that Lismore is a collection of
mia-mias round a head-house, instead of a
collection of squatter homesteads.
Very often you can hardly see the dead
whale for birds, and this seems to be a case
in point. When the late Dr. Black, of Mel-
bourne, died, he left sundry properties, in-
cluding that choice city site, Queen’s Walk,
on the corner of Collins and Swanston
streets, to certain beneficiaries, to whom an-
nuities were to be paid up to March 13, ’OB.
Then the trustees were ordered to sell the
properties and distribute the proceeds.
Queen’s Walk, however, though valuable,
proved unsaleable at a decent figure, so the
trustees held on. Certain, beneficiaries asked
the Supreme Court what it thought about
their action, and Justice Cussen opined that
the trustees were right, and could keep on
paying annuities till the blessed Walk, or
Run, or whatever it is, was sold. Five or
six expensive barristers, instructed by as
many firms of equally expensive solicitors,
took a hand in this argument. Two bene-
ficiaries, however, were dissatisfied with the
decision, and took the Full Court’s opinion
(Justices Madden, Hood and Hodges). The
Pull Court listened to the arguments of an-
other half-dozen costly gentlemen learned in
the law, and opined that Justice Cussen was
wrong, and that the trustees should sell at
once and divide up the estate. But it ap-
pears that these two conflicting judgments
both stand on the records, which, to the legal
eye, is untidy and improper, and liable to
create a dangerous precedent. So “it was
suggested” to the beneficiaries that another
Complete Court should be asked to formally
upset one or other of the decisions, and put
matters in straight legal trim ; and last week
Justices a’Beekett, Hodges and Hood listened
solemnly while nine erudite and costly poten-
tates argued the tremendous point afresh.
The Court reserved its decision —while the
legal profession retired to get its second
wind. There still remain the High Court
and the Privy Council, and, if the matter is
delicately handled, and the estate lasts, quite
a lot of excitement may yet be squeezed out
of the late Black’s savings.
Just in the middle of Victoria’s Police
Chief O’Callaghan’s recent expatiations on
the merits, popularity and general satisfac-
toriness of the “force,” the monthly examina-
tion of candidates happened along. Of the
192 applicants called up, 76 had either got
better billets, or couldn’t be bothered to turn
up. That left 116, 82 of whom were rejected
through failing to reach the physical standard.
Remained 34. of whom nine couldn’t pass
the simple educational exam. The 25 rem-
nants, or superior dregs, then stood before the
doctor, who fired out four. So of the orig-
inal 192 only 21 finally arrived at the honor
and glory of a baton and 6s. 6d. per day.
The worst of it was that, no sooner had these
21 got into the force, th,an they began, with
others recently joined, to consider how they
could get out of it. Their pay is so low
that even the most casual unskilled laborer
would scorn it. Their present lodging—
Russell-street barracks—is a comfortless,
unhealthy and unclean place, and their board
or mess contribution has lately gone up from
£2 15s. to £3 10s. per month per man. They
had got as far as the preliminary arrange-
ments for forming a union when the wild
O’Callaghan heard of it, and gave every man
in the barracks two days to . state, in writing
whether (1) he had given any information
to the press regarding the condition of the
force; (2) whether he wished to resign from
the force. The absurd Questions were framed
so that O’Callaghan could flaunt the answers
in the face of the public as proof that every-
thing was as it should be; and he got the
replies he anticipated with great unanimity.
But 97 out of the 105 dwellers in the bar-
racks tacked on a rider which O’C. would
rather have done without, to the effect that
they were “anxiously waiting to see what the
Government intended to do, as present condi-
tions and pay were unsatisfactory.” If he
wasn’t so superfluous, O’Callaghan would be
an amusing cuss.

The habitues of Melbourne’s Anglican
Cathedral are discussing the recent erection
of a mixed bathing font in that sacred, edi-
fice. The new bath, intended for total im-
mersions of adults, is a memorial to the late
Bishop Goe, and as a cathedral fitting it is
said to be. unique. Baptismal fonts in
general are shallow basins, suitable only for
washing or sprinkling the head of the bap-
tisee. The Goe memorial is expected to be
in great demand during the hot months.
Grown-ups who were baptised in infancy but
have forgotten what it felt like, are booking

sweet things in bathing gowns for ladies are

currency. A facetious
paymaster of the 73rd
has the credit of hav-
ing applied the terms
“sterling” and “cur-
rency” to the imported
and the native born
respectively. The
phrase is not now in
use. At one time “Cur-
rency Lass” and “Cur-
rency Lad” were used
as publichouse signs.
On the S.W. corner of
Hunter-street was once
the Currency Lass,
and on Brickfield Hill, many years ago. was
another, while there was a Currency Lad in
Market-street. To-day there is a Currency
Lass on the Glebe-road, and no doubt some
old towns in the interior still cherish the
sign. It is said that the original potentate
of the S. M. Herald never smiled again
after receiving a letter which described him
as “Mr. Fairfax, opposite the Currency Lass
Inn.” 4
A gentleman of color is complaining bit-
terly to the Adelaide papers of the wild rush
made by the women of England for his hand.
He wrote to some public body up in Lan-
cashire, where they used to have “purring”
( i.e., kicking) matches, saying that he could
do with a wife; and that was enough. He
got 24 applications by the first mail, and
tried to consider them in turn. By the next
mail, which was last week, he got 86, and
he began to feel worried. The prospective
brides range in point of age from 18 to 50.
and many of the letters and photos, enclosed
show them to be apparently refined and
assuredly comely. (He produced these “ex-
hibits” to the reporters.) He admits that
he had absentmindedly described himself as
chef at the Grand Central Hotel, whereas
his real position there is somewhat lower.
Still, he has a position and a reliable wage.
But the fact that over a hundred women
could be found in a week, ready to rush
across the world to an unknown colored in-
dividual on his own mere statement that he
could support a wife, speaks volumes for the
condition of affairs in the Cold Countrv.

Masses of wattle —golden, black, silver and
Cootamundra —brightened up Melbourne s
streets on September 2. The shimmering,
feathery blossom lends its pale gold to decor-
ation, but true Australians do not need to
wear it to remind themselves of its existence
and meaning. The blossom looks loveliest
where Nature put it. but of late years many
citizens have helped Nature. In Yarra-
side suburbs, where but a few years ago in-
digenous shrubs and trees were held of no
account as compared with imported and
mostly deciduous plants, one now sees Aus-
tralian acacias and eucalypts by the hun-
dred. Though its term of transcendent
beauty is but brief, the Cootamundra wattle
revels in such luxuriance of blossom that it
comes easily first favorite. After it, the
golden wattle, the blue gum and sugar gum
are frequent. Of late, the gorgeous scarlet
flowering gum has come into. notice. The
marvel is that the precious pioneers passed
over these beautiful evergreens for imported
frauds like the untidy. soil-impoverishing
pinus insiynis. or dispiriting winter skele-
tons like the elm, oak, beech, etc.

“The original skirt was the fig-leaf in the
Garden of Eden, and the women of to-day
are apparently returning to a somewhat simi-
lar fashion.” —Extract from■ cabled report of
a sensational Minneapolis (TJ.B.A.) sermon.
What Eve wore, women little care;
They scorn what Paris doesn’t wear.
A fig-leaf suited Mother Eve,
And now her daughters take French leave.
THE VILLA STANDS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mrs. Morton depicted the condition of Carlton as
infamous. She discovered rows of tiny two-roomed
hovels, erected in the back yards of more pretentious
houses, and often a third row of huts built in the
diminutive back yard belonging to the second row.
The owner of some pretentious residence has cut up
his back yard into pocket handkerchief allotments
for the erection of hovels. The authorities never in-
terfere with him. None of these dreadful dens has
a bathroom. You may stand at the back door and
touch the back fence. —-Melbourne Age.
Behold the Villa —how it stands !
Upraised, as ’tis but meet, on gentle hillock,
Vine-girt, with lovely shrubs and flowers embosomed,
With deep verandahs pent, and choicely fronted
With gleaming pillared portico,
Behold! It stands.
Hark to the strain that streams from out the Villa !
Some sweet Sonata or some chaste Nocturne
The dainty daughters of the Fatted Household
Pour from the grand piano ; and, at times,
Some radiant Girl, whose voice is all of Faery,
Rolls out a flood of song.
Behold again the Villa !
This time we gaze upon it from the rear,
And ask ourselves what slice of squalid slum,
What grievous, fever-haunted Ghetto hovel,
Has been transplanted by some Djinn accursed,
And dropped, to shame the spotless, shining mansion,
Hard by its backmost door.
A two-roomed hut, poor serf of that proud palace,
In lowliness bows down
And licks the heels the Villa fine exposes
As from a lordly gown ;
And lo ! some feet to rear of that same hovel,
Behold another hut
Of rotting timber and of rusty iron,
Devoid of paint anfl reeking all of squalor,
And bidding welcome to the fiends of Typhoid,
Stands out in grime.
No witching burst of music therefrom issues ;
At times a laugh inane,
Or maudlin burst of bawdy song outrushes,
And fouls the ambient air ;
I wot the filth that hapless humans live in
Creeps in by slow degrees, till, like a lichen
It crusts their very souls.
But Villa folk must lie full soft and riot,
And Villa folk must pass their days at ease,
And portly Wealth must go not short of purple,
And stately ladies languish as they please.
Wherefore it is but meet that human middens
A compost rich should breed,
Where Pride may raise the myriad scarlet blossoms
That root in human need ;
And so it comes that, girt by huts and hovels,
Which meekly pay a tributary toll
And call the Mansion Master of their soul,
The Villa stands!

FILLING THE CHURCHES: A BLOW
AT VAUDEVILLE.
Minneapolis, Monday Evening.—Rev. G. Morrill
in his sermons, denounces women’s fashions in, such a
manner that his church is crowded every Sunday
The original skirt, he says, was a fig leaf from the
Garden.of'Eden, and apparently the women of to-day
are returning to a somewhat similar fashion. The
ministers shows lantern slides to prove, how immodest
are the styles now in vogue.—Recent cable .
THE REV. ENTERTAINER : "The next slide,
dear br-r-rethren, will reveal the last sta«e
of transition from the costume of to-day to
that of Eden , some ” (Shrieks of im-
patient applause.)
“Monkoarns,” being suddenly incited by
the rush of nothing in particular, and having
no more cause to write on the undermen-
tioned matter now than any other day, ,ut
simply feeling that the Time is Ripe, holds
forth :
Somewhat about Melbourne bookshops, drinkeries
of the Pierian stream. Memory hardly goes behind
the rivals Robertson and Mullen. The yarn is that
Squatter Moffatt sent an order to Robertson, “Please
forward one ton books,” when he expected to enter-
tain the Duke of Edinburgh. There was also once
a rival, W. Robertson, in Elizabeth-street, as book-
seller. G. Robertson began in Collins-street East,
above the Athemeum ; Buzzard and Vale were i i
Bourke-street East; Vale went to Ballarat; Cade
was in Collins-street, a little west; Stephens fallowed
him ; Coppin was in Caple’s shop when he received
the staggering news of the loss of Brooke in the
London. Dwight, top of Bourke-street East, about-
next to the V/hite Hart, was the principal second-
hand man. Bennett, lower down Bourke-street, kept
up a good rivalry. His wife was very -able, carrying
on while he bought books ,in England. Charlwood
and Sons were in Bourke-street, near the Herald
office and post office. They did not care so much for
books, as for theatrical printing, which they pretty
well monopolised till Shaw, Harnett and Co. stepped
in, slicing off the Theatre Royal business for a time.
Charlwoods also dealt more in plays than any firm.
Muskett took over the bookselling business. Davis,
in Collins-street, is more recent. The secondhand
line has considerably brightened of recent ’years, with
fresh dealers coming in. I had almost got through
Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark, both in new
and old, Arcadian .Cole.
“Pessimistic remarks from “J.R.”; The
Panama Canal looks like bringing a heap of
trouble on the tJ.S. Already the tolls ques-
tion has enraged the Powers, and filled the
earth with ravings on the subject of Yankee
chicanery and sharp practice. Then there is
the question of competition with Suez. Ac-
cording to a recent cable:—
Professor Emory Johnson, the Panama Canal ex-
pert, told an interviewer that if the Panama propo-
sition was to be a financial success, the tolls must
be lower than those of Suez. Even lower tolls would
not withdraw from Suez the greater part of the
Oriental, trade, because of Suez’s greater traffic op-
portunities, etc.
It may be taken for granted that the Suez
Canal was immensely cheaper to construct
than that of Panama, and it is certainly
cheaper to maintain. It has no locks, and
little, if any, rock-cutting. It can be wid-
ened and deepened to almost any desired
extent by the simple process of dredging. No
one yet knows what the Panama Canal will
have cost when it is finished, and no one has
the _ remotest idea,
within a few millions
of dollars, how much a,
year it will cost to
maintain it. It should
also be remembered
that the vast work
runs through country
where earthquakes are
well nigh as common
as thunderstorms. How
would a serious ’quake
affect the heavy earth-
work and rock-cut-
tings of the Canal?
Disastrously, mayhap.
It is certain that only
the most capable engi-
neers will be put in
charge of the works,
but the enormous arti-
ficial lake which is
necessary to feed the
locks must always be
a source of danger in
the rainy season, and
will need constant
watching. On the At-
lantic side, the Canal
opens into the Carib-
bean Sea, where ports
are few and naviga-
ti o n dangerous.
Whether the Canal
will, in any case, be
used by many ships
beside the toll-free
Lj.S. coasters is very
hard to say. If not,'
the U.S. taxpayer will
find himself saddled
with a maintenance
bill that will make
him sit up and speak firmly through his nose.
The Argus, having considered the possi-
bility of some peculiar development in the
Australian race, grudgingly admits that our
people may vary from the old stock, but
almost tearfully advises us to be careful what'
we are about. “Of course, we are desirous
of cultivating to the utmost the qualities
which best suit life in this land. The action
of environment must tell on the mental and
physical character of our people.” But the
Argus goes on to trust in the good sense of
the people to see that the developments are not
ot such a nature as to make us a nation
apart from the grand old nation from which
we sprung-” Plainly what is wanted is a
hasty Bill to Retard the Progress of Racial
Development. If not we may wake up some
morn nig, and find ourselves distinctively and
definitely Austmligin. Not English, or Irish
or Scottish, or even British, but just Aus-
tralian. The English became English the
Bermans German, the French French, but
the Australian must remain a tadpole, or
capital will leave the country.
“Henry Horsecollar” writes:—
Where do our friends the Germans come in as re-
gards the washing habit? Dr. Quine, of Manchester
(England), has given an estimate to the Royal Sani-
tary Institute s Congress re the frequency of the
National Wash. He nuts Scotch people first, then
(2) Englishmen, (3) Irishmen, (4) U.S. women, (5)
English women (6) U.S. men, (7) Frenchmen, and
(8) Germans, let, at many hotels, where all--these-
nationalities can be observed, he reckons tfi at, any
day, about 1 per cent, of the guests have .a bath.
A MATTER OF HALF A CROWN,
HENRY: “ Stay, Rupert,’ I would hate; speech
with thee,”
RUPERT: “Nay, Henry, too well I know
speech is silver. ”
Therefore, the whole lot of the guests will get bathed
in 100 days, or (roughly speaking) 3$ times a year
—a case of 3i baths per annum per individual.
Now, if the Scotch folk at the head of the list are
notably clean, and wolf more than their share, of
such wash as is going, how much wash is left for
the travelling German at,the other end of the list?
Then there are people of smaller nationalities. \yho
don’t supply enough travellers lo enable an hotel 1
average to be made —Greeks, Chilians, Portuguese,
Danes, Spaniards, etc. If any of these races wash to
excess, as excessive wash is understood in England,,
the miserable German must dry-blow himself on his
travels. At the very special hotels the rates are
higher, but Dr. Quine’s estimate was that, at the
best, one guest in 20 has a bath on any given day,
and 19 do not. If that is the best result where there
is abundance of hot water and a roomy vessel to 101 l
in, what is it likely to be in homes where there is
only a bleak receptacle and a rush of bitterly cold
water? And what is it likely to be in homes where
there is no receptacle at all? The Englishman, says
Quine, washes less • as he grows old, but even while
he is still young enough to go about.,, he doesn’t
appear to make an heroic splash. Therefore, let Aus-
tralia hold on with both .hands to its blessed inheri-
tance, and establish all over this country a Society
for the Promotion and Preservation of AVashing. It
should make' war on houses without baths, promote
water.-conservation and better water supply for coun-
try towns, .encourage the expulsion of dirty people
from trades unions, Shakspeare societies, Orange
lodges hnd other institutions, insist on frequent and
intense washing in gaols, lunatic asylums, orphanages,
bp'ardihsvschools, monasteries and the like, and endow
Turkish baths. There is nothing more beautiful than
a well-endowed Turkish bath. It might even, found
the AVash Church, with a broad creed, and affiliate
it,, with any other existing sect that is prepared to
accept; the Wash doctrine, and walk in beauty ac-
cordingly. Then there is a wide field for the hosing
o‘f sundowners at country police stations, and other
possibilities too numerous to mention.
The peacefully-disposed anti-militarists in
Maoriland have been at it again. Recently’
they created a disturbance by turning a fire-
hose on a meeting convened to discuss the
military training scheme. Now they have
robbed Christchurch of one of its warlike
treasures. Until recently a pom-pom which
had been captured in the alleged Boer war
rusted proudly in Queen’s Square. The
mass of old iron got on the anti-militarists’
nerves, and they petitioned the local council
to have it removed. The loyal council of
course refused, and, one day, Christ-
church woke up to find that the gun,
which had been chained down to a concrete
base, had been chiselled from its anchorage
and shoved into the Avon River. The Avon
isn’t a very deep river, and if many more
things are thrown into it the scenery will be
spoiled.
Interesting fragment of evidence in Mel-
bourne District Court: “You say the de-
fendant tore your dress off, pulled out a
great deal of your hair, threw you down,
dragged you about the yard, and hit you with
a clothes-prop ?” “Yes, sir. He was most
discourteous.”
"Side-Lights” talks in his sleep:—
One of the bad old
sea-conventions which
will have to go short-
ly is the four-hours-on-
four-lioiirs-off watch
system. Hobody knows
who hasn’t tried it
the horror of never
having more than 31
hours’ .sleep on end.
It may be said lightly
that a man can turn
i» again after his four
hours duty, and sleep
for another 3J > hours.
Sometirnes he cap;
contrariwise, som e-
I imes he can’t, because
he isn’t bu.ilt that
way; While this Ar-
rangement is, bad for
the men before the
stick, it is unadulter-
ated Sheol for the
officers. In fine weather
the watch can prick
for a soft plank and
snatch a Snooze q n
deck, but the safety lof
the ship, and the
wakefulness of the
lookout and helmsman,
depend on the officer,
and he has to kejep
awake somehow. In
bad weather the sleep-
want isn’t so desper-
ate ; but in fine wea-
ther, when the ship ;is
droning smoothly
along, , a man some-
times needs to stick
pins in himself to keep
awake. An additional
danger lies in the fact
that,/ aboard most ,of
the bi g liners, tH e
officer, no matter hqw
useful, is not eofii-
pelled, to take h'i s
quota of sleep. So if
there is an alluring
girl in the vessel
(say), and he has the
romantic sentiment, he
devotes the greater
part of his four hours
, , , off to her, and goes on
watch even drowsier than he otherwise might
have been. If only the passengers knew of the
touch and go struggle between complete stupor
.and wastefulness in the mind of the man responsible
for their safety, and the narrow margin by which the
latter wins .and holds the ship from straying off the
course, and falling over the fence, they might be less
undisturbed in their slumbers. Jack Afloat doesn’t
kick ,or curse; too hard at the 12 hours duty he is
expected to put in, but he does clamor for some
time-adjustment • that will enable him to sleep like
other hvpnaji beings. There isn’t even the excuse of
, urgency., -to ■ justify the present uncivilised state of
affairs. Like Party Government, all-night Parlia-
mentary ’sittings, -etc., it has drifted. down to us
from the Dark Ages, and no one has had the sense
to wipe it out,
Dr. Quine, a writer on sanitation, speaking
at the Sanitary Congress in England the
other day, said the bedroom basin was the
only washing vessels used by 40,000,000 of the
people of the United Kingdom. lie might
have added that millions don’t run to the
but wash at a tap, or else leave it alone.
Ihe doctor adds that the clergy are notori-
ously infrequent bathers. If cleanliness is
next to godliness, the parson must be. at least
two removes.

THE GOOD, OLD-FASHIONED STYLE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Cancer, consumption and the communion cup
formed the triple argument of Dr. Neil McDougall,
"’ho argued at the annual meeting of St. DaVid's
Presbyterian Church, Christchurch, Maoriland, for a
change in sacramental methods. He quoted the
British Medical Journal on the danger of germ-
transmission from mouth to mouth—and urged that
the common cup be replaced with individual ones.
Mr. Duncan Macpherson, City Missioner, differed
from Dr. McDougall—quoting St. Luke—and urged
members to continue in the good old-fashioned style.
—Daily pager.
Mr. Duncan, called Macpherson,
Urges each communion person
When he joins the giddy Wowsers with a smile,
Not to try and use his gumption
To dodge cancer and consumption,
But to catch ’em in the “good old-fashioned style.”
Do not stop, beloved brother,
For in many, many other
Ways the present age the good old saints would rile ;
And they’d curse in desperation,
Should they find no Christian nation
Is now working in the ’’good old-fashioned style.”
M e can’t now, beloved brother,
Catch a party of another
Church and truss him up to stew in boiling “ile,”
And-the thumb-screws and the racks, too,
And the “boot” and melted wax, too
Oh! mv heart weeps for the “good old-fashioned
style.”
In these days a common person—■
Bow it must annoy Macpherson—
If they amputate his head or test his bile,
M ill have, nurse and doctors messing
Round with antiseptic dressing.
Ah-h! ’twas different in the “good old-fashioned
style.”
Oh ! to get some tar a-hoiling—
Never mind about it soiling—
Or a red-hot bar or furnace-heated file,
Stick ’em on the bleeding stump, Mac ;
Let the beggars howl and thump, Mac,
Just remind ’em it’s the “good old-fashioned style.”
Once the wretches shrieked and shouted,
And no earnest Christian doubted
But that all the horrors all the blessed while
Were by Providence provided—-
We’d be damned if you or I did
wl 'th that dear “good old-fashioned style.”
{Give vs back, 0 Lord , our “good old-fashioned

“Hogg” : Montfort l’Amaury, in Seine-et-
Oise (France), has leaped into fame. A wealthy
resident left the handsome manager the sur-
rounding estate and a fortune for the use of dead-
beats, paupers, swaggies and sundowners of every
description. He bequeathed his possessions to the
unwashed, the dosser, the loafer, the sleeper-out and
the chicken-snatcher. They have been flocking to the
favored locality from every point of the compass,
and the municipal authorities are tearing their hair,
Cursing the testator, nd wondering how to stop the
invasion and get rid of the plague. That is exactly
what the testator desired and contemplated. The
municipal council offended him by cutting down trees
and effecting various other supposed improvements
around his estate. He swore to be revenged upon
them, and now in the Elysian Fields or Hades or
wherever he is, he is doubtless laughing at the
success of his valedictory jest.
A MODERN SIR GALAHAD.

“Wal” : For a country that has only had
a few years experience of life as a part of the civil-
ised world, the Commonwealth’s dependency of
Papua has a variegated population. The figures of
1911 show the following:—

“Other countries” comprise a motley lot, there
being a sprinkling of Afghans, Arabs, Cingalees and
nondescripts. Over two-thirds of the mob are em-
ployees of the various mission societies. Some of
them are married to Papuan women, and have added
a number of weird mixtures to the color scheme of
the population. What the hash will be like in
another decade is hard to say.
Dear Bulletin, —Don’t see that Vigi-
lans” (B. 8/8/T2) has any just cause to spread
the wet blanket of his disapprobation over the
scheme to develop the agricultural lands of the Daly
River (N.T.). Because, in old times, C. B. Fisher
and others were badly advised in trying to rear
bullocks on the raw, sour grasses of the coastal
region of the Territory, and because no one has
since rushed the locality with a capiel farm, or a
goat-breeding outfit, or a pig ranch, or a mule cor-
poration, or a scheme for raising wild cats, there
is no reason why the country shouldn’t be useful
for something else. As a matter of fact it is. I
consider the new Administrator is wise in turning
his attention to the agricultural possibilities of the
Daly River lands. The flood-plains of the Lower
Daly are probably the pick of the agricultural lands
of the Northern Territory, being second neither to
the Adelaide River country nor to the rich region
of the scrub-lands further north. Furthermore, it
isn’t far from the nearest intersection of the railway
at Brock’s Creek, and an outlet by water (river and
sea) has been provided by Providence. The man
who knows the Daly River region better than any
person living is J. H. Niemann, of Pine Creek. He
lived there for some years, and is a man of big in-
telligence, an optimist, a good Australian, and a
white man through to the heart; and the close
settlement of the wonderful Daly River country was
the dream of his life when I first knew him. That
raw coastal region that won’t produce bullocks will
grow cotton and sugar-cane, and tobacco and hemp, and
most other sub-tropical products in profusion, in-
cluding all the fruits and vegetables necessary to
a white man’s wants. It will also grow white
babies if it is required to. It is in the matter of
cotton plantation that Dr. Gilruth has probably
got his eye glued on the Daly River. Cotton has
grown there, in a half-wild state, for years. Bushes
of cotton ( Gossypium Barbadense ) grew at the back
of the ruined R.C. chapel, and otherwhere about the
ancient settlement, that were planted by missionaries
many years ago. These never received any atten-
tion, and were choked with weeds and couch-grass
and fathom-high marshmallows; yet they continued
to bear cotton, good and plenty, and they never had
a pest on them. And, what is more, the astounding
vegetables withstood periodical scorchings from fierce
grass-fires each year. At the Howley I saw per-
ennial cotton bushes (again the good old Gossypium
Barb.) that were Bft. high by 20ft. or 30ft. in
circumference. They were covered with fat bolls,
and looked as if their surroundings suited them right
down to their roots and up again. My conclusions
were that the climate was everything, and that the
quality of the soil, providing it was well drained,
was a matter of indifference. So, doubtless, not-
withstanding the sneer of “Vigilans,” Providence
and Dr. Gilruth may yet make a “do” of the Daly
River district. —Yours, etc., Mallarapoonie.

“Gip” : What seems to me to yell aloud to
science, Heaven and the Ohapman-Alexander mission
for elucidation is the iron determination on the
part of frogs to haunt particular spots. One dinky
little green chap has, to my knowledge, been sitting
on a window-sill for the last three months, and
another of my acquaintance chose the top of a bath-
room shower for his roosting place. But the most
pertinacious frog I ever knew was a native of Graf-
ton. He was a large and portly amphibian, and he
chose as his squattage the washstand of a person in
the Government ' service. To squash the creature
appeared an obscene act, but when, after being ten-
derly removed on a towel and gingerly thrown out
by a hind leg, the thing still returned to its perch,
it became necessary to resort to violent methods.
Throwing it at passing ferry boats proved of no
avail, and attempts to smite buildings a mile distant
with its objectionable presence had a similar result.
The faithful animal was always back on his beloved
washstand. Putting it in a box, the desperate and
haunted tenant took it for a long ride in the train,
a long walk along a strange road, a long row across a
pleasant river, and a quiet stroll to the centre of a
lonely and forsaken peninsula. The man returned
alone. The frog didn’t get back for quite eight
days.
“Warrumbucca” : You meet a decent bloke
or cove in the bush now and again. The other day
I avoided navigating my team through the paddock
of one of these phenomena, though it would have
saved much distance. Next morning I met him.
“Why ther Hell didn’t ver take the team through
me blanky paddick?” he asked kindly. “Well,” I
said, “the horses were a bit weak, and the going
looked soft, so I took the hard track.” “Daman-
blarstit, man,” he said, with true Old World cour-
tesy, “haven’t I got any blank blanky horses to give
ye a pull, curse and blank me?” “Righto!” I
countered shamefacedly, “I’ll know better next
time.” “An’ you oughter know better!” he thun-
dered affectionately. “What in Hell else am I
blanky well here for?”
“Tiaki” from Maoriland: What part of
Parnell or Sydenham has “Tamumu” (B. 8/8/’l2)
l’hoster-Plirasered in order to glean his zoological
and ornithological “facts”? Let me tell him that
the Maoris had a peculiar species of dog the like of
which has not been found in any other part of the
world ( kuri ruarangi). It is improbable that even
the earliest white settlers ever saw one. Abel Tas-
man, possibly, saw the last of them. They were
BY DEGREES.
“Jimmie Pannikin ” : Some queer immigrants have reached the North Cowst of N.S.W;
but the limit came to light a few days ago. The boss told him to bog in and learn to milk,
and the new arrival offered no objection. "Buthe said, "I'm afraid of these ere knows.
What abaht gitting me first lessons on a calf.” The boss dropped dead or thereabouts.
something like mongrel sheep dogs, with abnormal
heads, foxy ears, and short, bushy tails. They were
used to hunt birds with, and were great pets. Their
bark was a weak “au, au,” and they would not
bite even a Wowser or a Tamumu. Ilenare enjoyed
the flesh as a delicacy, and the pelts as a motor-
coat ( ihupuni ). Furthermore, they would not go
wild, and could not be driven away from the scent
of the shark stews with a gatling gun. Again,
“kuri” does not mean dog, it means beast. “Kar-
arehe” is the Maori name for dog. Evidently
“Tamumu” is like the people who think that
“poaka” is borrowed from the white man’s “porker.”
Cook found place-names among some of the islands,
such as “pa-puaka” (pig pen) and “puaka ngun-
guru” (grunting pig). He also found stronger evi-
dence than that. He found the pigs themselves.
Perhaps “Tamumu” got his dog evidence in the
same way that he procured his moa information
(B. 20/6/T2). There is no evidence that any
Maori ever saw a moa. Ilenare has no feather mats
from the big chicken, and most of the old shark
consumers believed the moa bones to be the remains
of giant predecessors. Others thought them to have
represented some huge beast. The N.E. coast
Maoris alone recognised them as fowl. Human re-
mains have been found pillowed on moa egg-shells,
but they may have been the frames of the ancient people
(tangata-whenua), who inhabited Moaland before
Henare demonstrated his military-training system
to them. They also had canines, so “Tamumu” will
see that this country has been well dogged even
before Caesar was shortened and christened.
“Eddyson” : Permit me to enter Lai Lai
(Vic.) for your just-inaugurated slowest district
competition. Not for nothing has it won its vaude-
ville reputation as the place where irresistible languor
and immovable lassitude meet and mingle. I have
spent four years in Lai Lai during the past three
months, and I have found everything excessively
gradual there, with the exception of the waterfall,
and there was some hesitancy even about that. Dur-
ing my stay the watch I was carrying had an attack
of backward paralysis, and I employed an afternoon
hunting for the time. None knew the time, nor wanted
to. They knew it was time, and unripe, and that suf-
ficed. My concern in this matter was plainly regarded
as the mark of a restless revolutionary. Amongst
others, I questioned a tired man who was growing
onions—or rather sitting on a mossy bank waiting
for onions to come up. No, he didn’t know what
o’clock it was. “Do you never know the time in
Lai Lai?” I asked pettishly. “Oh, yes,” he replied.
“I got a poplar in me back yard, V when it begins
to bud I know the spring’s cornin’.”
“Tamumu”: In the grey manuka wastes,
north of Auckland, which form the greater part of
the gum country, the cocky who takes up a section
finds that bush suitable for fencing timber is extremely
scarce. On his 100- or 200-acre section there is
not, as far as the eye can see, a single tree or log
from which even the shadow of a post could be got.
But, hidden by perhaps only two or three inches of
soil, are giant kauris, as sound as the day on which
they crashed to earth. They are easily located by
means of the gum spear. Thereafter, it is merely
a question of clearing away enough of the encircling
clay to enable the crosscut to be brought into action,
in order to get fencing timber galore. Why the
good timber is all below ground, and mere scrub
or penny herbage above, I cannot tell. Perhaps
there is a curse on the country.

THE TWO LAST MEN IN THE CITY: “Now,
the question is, which of us is to (his)
shee the other one ’ome?”
“Lantana”: I should like the opinion of
the sainted Bruntnell and the sin experts of the
Ohapman-Alexander troupe on the case of William
Jenkins. William was sitting in his home when a
yearning for beer assailed him. Did he fight it
down by means of prayer- and hymn-book? Nope.
He simply put on his hat and hied him to the
nearest pub. As he returned, gratified, if not actu-
ally sozzled, he heard a crash. Entering the house
he discovered that the whole of the plaster ceiling had
fallen on the precise spot where he would have been,
if he hadn’t yielded to the yearning above
mentioned, and fallen a victim to the Demon Alco-
hol. If any professional soul-salver can wrest me
a moral out of this happening, I pledge myself,
here and now, to stand him three (3) milks.
A SUNSET EPISODE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We cursed her —and we pitied her,
The Sunset’s daughter, who,
Up north, where white men seldom were,
Was wed to Kandal Dhu.
He found her at the Quandong Bore,
As fair as he was brown,
Due north five hundred miles, and more,
From quaint old Sunset Town.
Up north she saw him as a King,
When first he came to woo ;
Down south he was a Colored Thing—
Detested through and through.
She saw the white men pass, and gaze
With fierce hate in their eyes;
She heard the thin-lipped bitter phrase
Flung at her sacrifice.
The white girls passed her by, and turned
Their eyes across the way
(White pride decreed that she be spurned,
Though thrice as fair as they).
They did not speak; ’twas understood
That, changeless, on each tongue,
For her who smirched her maidenhood
Contempt unspoken hung.
She saw the great White King who might
Have claimed her as his queen,
Had she pre-seen with wisdom’s sight
The proud, glad, Might-Have-Been.
But no repentance could repay
One half the debt she owed;
And God gives back no yesterday
To her who breaks His Gode.
But came a day when Summer burned
The shrivelled grass to grey,
And Kandal Dhu again returned
Along the Great Lone Way.
Red blew the dust across the plain;
The mad-capped mirage shone;
He steered his hunchies home again—-
But Kandal’s bride was gone!
We asked no questions, and were asked
No questions in return ;
Each face was as the Sphinx’s masked,
Each mouth a silent urn....
The shutters drawn... At whose request ?
Well, let those tell who care,
That we who knew the least knew best
Who paid one white girl’s fare.

PATRONISING PARTY: “I hope you are nice,
well-behaved boys."
THE NIPPER: “ I’m not too horrible, Mister,
but Jim, he's a blit herer."
“Eryander” : Amongst* all the prevailing
talk about “compulsory service,” I haven’t heard
any reference to the one-time perfect Zulu military
system. At 10 years of'age every lad had, so to
speak, to join the ranks as a kind of squire or
weapon-carrier to some adult relative, and no Zulu
man was allowed to marry until he was 35. Up to
that age he had to nut in six months of every year
in military training—Special kraals being set apart
for that purpose. The men were nearly all of splen-
did physique and dauntless courage, and nothing
but modern diStance-slaughtering-methods could have
prevailed against such a magnificent hand-to-hand
fighting force. The Zulus knew the value of begin-
ning early, ' and even the magazine-rifle couldn’t
stop them, as long- as there were any of them left
to come on.

sible, sir! Why, we

THE VICTIM : “ Well,

“Spud”: For long stayers in the scrap-
ping line, I have no hesitation in nominating turkey
gobblers. I am possessed of an Ottoman hen.
I reared her from her bright young egg-
hood, and watched her
grow in beauty day by
day; Until at last she be-
came a maiden turkey in
her prime, and towards
the end of August she
turned lightly to thoughts
of love. Nor were her
pinings vain, for two gob-
blers belonging to my
neighbor got their field
glasses on her, and were
smitten by. her winning
ways and the music of her
voice. They lost no time
in calling, and strutted
before her admiring gaze,
feathers puffed out, wings
trailing, tails spread. But
one young buck grew tired
of displaying his manly
beauty, and attempted to
hold her hand. He was
immediately assailed by
the other aspirant for the
fair damsel’s claw. Then
ensued a fight magnificent
to behold. I was time-
keeper and referee. They
battled chest to chest,
sometimes with necks en-
twined or backs inter-
locked. In spite of iny
cries of “time,” they re-
fused to break, and
scrapped away for lhr.
31min., with never a
smoko. The end came
when the older and more
drinky fowl dropped to
the ground. The success-
ful candidate gave him a
feeble final punch in the
neck. Then he attempted
a strut of triumph, but
succeeded only in an un-
steady wobble, odd feath-
ers puffed out and half a
tail spread. In the mean-
time the sweet cause of
the row had retired to
her virtuous couch on the roost and had blown her
candle out.

“Billy T.”: Discovered two cement bar-
rels in a secluded part of Albert Park, Melbourne,
when taking an early morning run last week. They
were joined together lengthwise, and in a specula-
tive spirit I put in the boot. They parted and a
small, embittered man wriggled out of the northern
one. His legs remained immersed in the southern
keg. “Blime!” he wailed, “ain’t a Hinglishman’s
’ome his carsle?” It was a doss. The assisted im-
migrant indoors had devised a smart clip to keep the
home from bursting, so to speak. He confided to me,
with many a harsh comment on the worthlessness of
’Orstralians, 1 that he couldn’t go out and look for
work for fear of his abode being stolen.
“Montalex”: “Yalgun” (B. 22/8/T.2) is
right. The blue-tongued lizard is not venomous.
I have been bitten by the brute myself, and suffered
only the ordinary inflammation. And now let me
rise to point out—-for the n-th time—that no Aus-
tralian lizard is venomous. Some of them certainly
“look the part,” but no one of them enters such an
obvious external caveat as the Mexican heloderma,
the only venomous lizard known to zoology. This
creature, which —unlike the snakes —injects its
poison through the lower fangs, has korridum for
an appropriate surname, and has a skin like a bad
case of nodular leprosy. The West. Bornean Dyaks
attribute venomous powers to the “sidak,” a small
lizard of the monitor family (to which belongs our
gohanna), but, after dissecting a couple of dead
ones to make sure, I allowed a live one to bite me
My prompt demise didn’t happen.
* * * *
“Bromide”: Touching this bike-in-war
controversy, it is borne in on me that “Machete” is
but a carpet bushman, or George-street backblocker,
or something similar. Had he had personal traffic
with the remotenesses of this vast land, he would
have met plenty of men who bestride or push bikes,
loaded with swag, billy, water-bag and tucker, over
all sorts of country—roads or no roads —and think
•nothing of it. A shearing-shed at roll-call nowa-
days looks as if a city bike shop had got adrift in
it, so many of the metal steeds are there in evi-
dence. They weren’t carried there on the shearers’
backs, and the roads to the sheds aren’t wood-
blocked either. Granted, that where the country is
absolutely rotten, the bike-proprietor does a bit of
pushing; the fact still remains that he does an
immense deal of riding. The practice—carpers not-
withstanding—is going to have a notable effect in
the defence of Australia some day. The bush biker
travels light. F’riftstans, the men of the Greenhide
Push in N.W. Queensland are quite happy if they
start out on a long prospecting trip with a bag of
flour, some tea and sugar, a 21b. tin of baking 1
powder, tobacco, rifle, 200 cartridges and a lump of
greenhide. So rationed they are capable of main-
taining themselves for months. Now, these chaps
or bloques knock about nearer the place where the
trouble is likely to be than any other crowd, and
they are going to count if trouble comes. And there
are thousands like them elsewhere. It is certain
that they will be right up in front in time for
the first scrap, and they will accomplish the feat by
the aid of their bikes. With horses, water will be
a big trouble up .North unless there has been a
decent rainy season. A couple of dry years may
mean little or no grass. The bike man has no need
to worry over such things. A drop in the bag sees
him to the next water-hole easily. No! you
mightn’t be able to charge a position on bikeback,
but you can do more with a cycle in dry country
than with a horse—and, there is many a dry. stretch
to travel over before Australia is taken.

“Snooker”; The untutored Australian
savage shows himself a subtle reasoner on occasion.
Thus, when “Billy” defeated “Jimmy” for the abori-
ginal , 100yds. championship of Mudanmuck Gully
(first prize a bottle of rum), James claimed half
the prize. “ ’Ow th’ devil can yer claim ’alf th’
rum?” yelled Dungav’s chief backer, “’E won
orright.” James spat vigorously, and replied, “Him
bin win orright, Boss, but if I not bin running who
could ’e win from, Boss?”
“George Street”: The climate of Great
Britain is a sorrowfu 1 fact. To describe as the
true home of a white race a country which can’t
keep decently dry for one Test match out of three,
looks like insulting the white man. to the extent of
suggesting that his true habitat is mud. No one
in Australia who knows the British winter tries to
pretend that it is cheerful, but as winters go it
is decency itself to the awful thing which does duty
there for a summer. Nor can it be argued that the
splash of recent years, and of this year in particular,
is phenomenal. Even the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle
has its seasonal reports spattered with wet clay,
and anyone who likes to look up the weather
records for the 20 or 30 years which closed the
eighteenth century, which are to be found in
White’s “Selborne,” will begin to feel damp and
cold all over with sheer pity for the contemporaries
of Captain Cook and Robert Burns. British poets
sing like mad about the flowers of May and the roses
of June. The vegetables are there all right, but
all evidences point to the sober fact that they must
be picked, and always did have to be, picked,
by persons who held their umbrellas over
the blossoms and got their feet wet in
the grass. The proof that Britain is not even
second-class as a home for the white man is to be
found in the fact that the said white man is not
amphibious, and that he suffers in a sore-souled and
twisted-bodied sort of fashion from all the rheuma-
tism which may happen along. Tropical. Australia
is sometimes warm and sometimes wet, but if a fair
comparison be made between it and the land of the
Ancient Britons, the vagaries of its climate over a
period of years, when all put in a heap don’t
amount to the actual misery often concentrated into
a single day in the Cold Country. Yet that same
Cold Country, as a white man’s home,, is reckoned
worth building enormous fleets to defend, and the
Australian Government doesn’t think enough of the
real white man’s country, called the Northern Ter-
ritory, to go ahead and build a straight line of
railway for its development and protection. By-
and-bye, perhaps, when the' remnant of the white
race is trying to keep warm in the neighborhood of
the South Pole, the place their fathers wouldn’t
keep may come to be regarded as a lost Paradise,
which the flaming sword of Asia guards against
those who shudderingly chafe their toes on the ice-
bergs of despair.
“Ganesha”: Rosie was a very ancient
aboriginal lady. She lived in the Far North, in the
land of pearl and gold, swamp and jungle, sweat
and sunset and silver-lead, ant-hills, coral, finches,
emus, snakes, railways that aren’t there, explorers,
prospectors and cattle duffers, horses and cattle,
absentee politicians, station-managers, sundowners,
lonely pubs and telegraph wires. But she paid no
attention to such trifles. She was old and somewhat
neglected by the tribe. After the feast she was thrown
a kangaroo rib c a bit of gristle, but never any tit-
bit, such as a nice piece of wallaby liver or stewed
worm or baked snake. And Rosie was an epicure.
Luckily she was a gifted woman; a natural ventrilo-
quist. When the food , was too suggestive of a four-
penny restaurant Rosie got struck with a brilliant
notion. She announced sadly to the callous tribe
that the spirits of the bush were calling her, and
one night she wandered away. She found a suitable
hiding place, and kept very still till some men of
the tribe came forth to look for her. They called
and shrieked, but for a long time Rosie preserved a
mysterious silence. Then, at last, her voice came
put of a strange place, high up in the. atmosphere
where there wasn’t anything. It made the statement
that the bush spirits had taken her away because the
tribe was no plurry good, and didn’t know how to

treat a venerable lady. They asked her to come
back, but the voice said it would see them blowed
first. The medicine men were geatly perplexed at
the magic, and when Rosie’s voice broke out in a
new place in the ether, repeating the sorrowful tale
with variations, they left for home in a hurry.
Later on, Rosie arrived, looking shaky and scared,
and very innocent, and repeated the simple legend
how she had been taken away by the spirits of the
bush, and she prophesied how dreadful things would
happen if she were not with the tribe. After much
pressure from the elders she agreed to stay on for a
bit. And the tribe then recognised Rosie at her true
worth, and filled her up with the most ancient ami
valued eggs, and turkey ragout, and dugong oil, and
other delicacies. Rosie was very fat when I chanced
on her, for whenever the tribe had moments of for-
getfulness a far-away look would come into her eyes,
and a casual reference be made to the spirits of the
bush.
STAUNTON’S FARM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In Staunton’s paddock the stumps are grey,
The logs lie scattered on every side,
At the will of the wind the grasses sway .
From dawn to the quiet evening tide.
’Tis little enough of shade is there.
When the sun shines down from a cloudless sky,
The heat-waves rise on the quivering air—
Twisting the long grey fence awry.
And all day long through the sleepy scene
O’er sand and pebbles a creek runs east;
A few trees dotting the place with green
Give shade and shelter 1 to bird and beast.
It’s better at dawn when the magpies call
And robed in crimson the morning breaks,
Then rosy tints on the landscape fall,
And, stretching its limbs, the land awakes.
A crow sits watchful upon a gate,
His smooth plumes shining like sable silk ;
At the milking-yard the cattle wait
With fresh white tribute of morning milk.
Then Staunton, mounting his horse, rides forth
To view his paddocks, and Staunton’s son,
With axe on shoulder, goes gaily forth,
For work is waiting and must be done.
And Staunton’s wife —has she time to turn
With so ’'much to shape and so much to trim—
With bread to bake and butter to churn,
And the honey to strain and the milk to skim?
And Staunton’s Mary, the tall, the sweet,
With the rounded arms and the peach-like bloom ;
It's little she idles—with hands and feet
Flashing and flying about the room.
Rich beauty, raining from radiant skies,
Has graced her, making her pure and fair,
With the deepest blue of -the sea in her eyes
And the darkest dusk of the night in her hair.
AVith farewell lights on the western steeps
The sun goes down, and with cooling hand
And a touch that soothes —the twilight creeps—
A thing of greyness athwart the land.
Then, all toil over, the man and wife
Sit mutely musing on thirty years,
Filled full of trial and toil and strife,
And love triumphant through sighs and tears.
And Alary’s voice in the twilit room
Soars high like a jewelled bird that flies,
And all is hushed in the scented gloom,
And muteness dreams ’neath the arching skies.
“Come home, come home!” ’tis the last bird calls.
On hills of silence, on creek and plain.
Dew-wet, soft-breathing, the darkness falls,
And golden stars in the heavens reign.

DIRGE OP THE VANISHED SYDNEX
COUNTER LUNCH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The corned beef torn as if by dogs.
The slashed and riddled cheese.
The gnawed and nibbled feet of hogs,
Farewell! Farewell to these!
Farewell to the disordered bread!
Batter we’ll see no more!
Strew crumbs upon each mourner's
head.
Strew bones upon the floor!
No longer will a pot of beer
Suffice for every need,
For prog has grown too blessed dear,
Each one must BUY his feed.
The merry days are past and gone
When Bung kept open house.
And spread good food to lure us on
To banquet and carouse.
How many times have we not stayed
And eaten of his grub,
Swelling before him unafraid
To show we liked his pub.
With hands and mouths stuffed full of
lunch.
Our strong jaws working well.
Remember how we used to munch
And how we used to swell"!
Remember what a jolly crew
We used to gather there!
Each with a pot of wholesome brew
Would take a hero’s share.
The little parties that we had!
Aye, there’s the hardest rub!
This saving regulation, lad.
Has broken up our club!
We thought he HIKED to see us eat—
To watch us gaily stuff
With crumbs and bones about our feet,
Until we’d had enough.
But now we know that ev’ry plate
We piled with bread and ham
Was sauced with bitter rage and hate.
And poisoned with a “damn.”
Ah, well! His scorn we never knew;
Our grief he shall not see:
We long enjoyed, O cheerful crew.
His hospitality.

PERSONAL
ITEMS
Alfred Green, the Launceston solicitor who
died recently in his 75th year, was one of
the oldest citizens of Tasmanian’s northern
capital. He was a devoted churchman, and
established a record by attending Holy Trin-
ity parish church for 70 years—ll as a
scholar, 17 as a teacher and 42 as secretary.
He was official scribe at the time of his
death. Launceston was his birthplace, and
he spent all his life there, and saw about as
much of the great outer world as a barnacle.
JIMMY BLAIR, Queensland's new Minister
of Public Instruction.
The death recently of publican Stutt, of
Doncaster, near Melbourne, removed a politi-
cal identity of the early days. In the early
’7o’s he owned a hotel in upper Bourke-
street, which was the rendezvous of every
live politician of the time. There was a
private menagerie in the yard, and the resort
came to be known as “Stutt’s Lions,” several
cages of those animals being included in the
collection. He represented Grant in the
House just before Peter Lalor. Later on, he
acquired the pub at Doncaster and another
at Box Hill, a few miles across country.
He .retired from business recently and was a
notable figure in the pretty picnic region.
Though a very old man, he was remarkably
vigorous until near the end, and his flowing
board was generally sighted fluttering be-
hind a pair of the smartest horses in the
district.
The recent death of a V ictorian land-
owner of vast acreage and tremendous Tory
principles recalls the beginning of the
family. It was founded, many similar
families, by a convict who married a convict
woman. Under Britain’s maternal care
Australia was then a country where any de-
cently-behaved resident could be a large
landowner for the asking. Britain supplied
it with a population of convicts who, in
many cases, grabbed as much territory as
they desired —on ticket-of-leave —and thus
helped to form the fine old Anglo-Australian
aristocracy which has ever blocked the way
to closer • settlement, and is now denouncing
Labor legislation as a tyranny of class
over caste. Apply the X-rays to the back-
bone of the Commonwealth’s Tory party,
and you find the emblem of the broad arrow
embedded in the centre of it. These haughty
notabilities are fond of posing as men who
rose by their own endeavors, and they often
say that if the men of to-day had the same
grit as OTJII fathers had they could rise just
as WE have done. It is too thin. The
country doesn’t nowadays give a man 50,000
acres for being a criminal.
“0.K.” writes
The late J. S. Butters represented Portland in two
Victorian Parliaments prior .to 187 0, and didn’t
leave even a footmark on the shores of politics. It
was after Portland had done with him that he went
to Fiji and gave moral instruction to old King
Thakambau and his dusky courtiers for four years.
He appointed himself Speaker to Thak’s Parliament,
and shook things up. As an entertainer of visiting
Australians he went the whole hog. Tradition says
that on one occasion'he gave a dinner party, at which
each white guest had a colored handmaiden to wait
on him, and then, like a Roman Emperor bidding
each guest take away the golden dish on which he
had eaten his “scran,” he loftily presented each guest
with his particular charmer- —for they were all
charmers in the best Fijian sense. However, the general
tone of the dinner-party was adverse to the host’s
resolution, and some of the older gents went so far
as to accuse Butters of bad taste when they returned
to Melbourne. There were Wowsers, of a sort, even
in those purple days of yore. In fact, I expect there
were Assyrian Wowsers in the glad, mad, bad days of
Asshurbanipal.
“E.C.” : After two years of almost unin-
terrupted suffering, Brother Judkins, of Vic-
toria and Maoriland, has at last met the
death he had looked in the face so long.
Judkins was no brilliant genius, and he was
handicapped by poor health, an undistin-
guished appearance, and an impossible name.
Yet he succeeded by pure energy and bog-
ging-in. He was no Wowser; he fought,
for all he was worth, the drink evil and
social evils of other sorts; but sectarianism
troubled him not. Had he been less of a
social and more of a political reformer, he
would have left a much deeper and more
lasting mark than he did. Yet within his
limitations he was a whole-hearted worker.
Teacher, tutor, missionist, auctioneer, lec-
turer and semi-journalist, he wasted but
few of the short days of his 43 years; and
the public appreciated his energy and hon-
esty of purpose.
A. S. Meek, who collects birds and butter-
flies for Walter Rothschild’s private museum
in England, left Sydney last week for Papua
and other islands to pursue the bloodthirsty
and elephantine beetle. He has just come
back from England, where he signed a new
contract for the obliteration of coleoptera
and such like. He is .also to bring back
stuffed germs and broken-down flies. In the
course of his struggles he will visit 37 differ-
ent islands, and make collections from each,
lie an offer from a second Roths-
child ;to collect fleas for his museum. This
Rothschild has the finest assortment of dead
and bashed and squashed fleas in the world.
Meqk declined the flea engagement. He pre-
to hit something nearer his own size.
The slaying of a flea, especially if it is a
married flea with a large family, is too much
like Jack Johnson hitting a feather-weight
when he isn’t looking.
Albert Dorrington, an Englishman who
spent a few years in Australia (it was un-
derstood by some folk here that Dorrington
was merely a pen-name, and that the real
designation was Bob Smith), has written
an article in the Contemporary Re-
view about the alleged soualor and misery
of the far inland settler. Dorrington was
an electro-plater, or something of the sort,
with a fine turn for literature, and a great
streak of imagination. He was really , a city
product, and, so far as is known, Parramatta
was his western limit by land. Still, lie
once did a sea trip to Eden. One of his
romances was laid on the Palmer Goldfield,
and his hero used to climb a hill in the even-
ing, and look with misty, longing eyes out to
sea. In the present case, Dorrington’s
gift has not failed him. He describes his
modest building allotment on the rail-
way line at Waitara, about nine miles from
Sydney, as if it were a dingo-infested region
out in the boundless wilderness, rather than
a place to which peaceful old commercial
gentlemen plodded home at night with hand-
bags.
“Rope Boy” writes :
Peter Bowling has been nominated as the N.S.W.
South Coast miners’ general secretary. He appears to
be keen on getting the job, an active canvass having-
commenced on his behalf a few hours after the death
of the late secretary. At a meeting of the Delegate
Board, a week or so back, Peter's eloquence induced
the delegates to appoint him acting-secretary until
the election takes place. Some of them are now
asking themselves if they have dealt fairly by the
man who looked after things during the late secre-
tary’s illness. It is current talk throughout the dis-
trict that Peter can talk the head oft most of the
delegates on the Board. His propositions are nearly
alwavs carried; but when they are placed before the
lodges for consideration, they are generally rejected.
Whether he can persuade the Southern men into tak-
ing him on trust as their general secretary remains
to”be seen. 1 guess his actions lately, in not bowing
to the will of the majority of the Miners’ Union, will
have to be explained; and we are told they will be
explained to our perfect satisfaction. In fact,
according to reports, Peter is able to explain any-
thing.
“Vie.”: F. W. Armytage, senior, of our
Western district family, has just passed
away. His father, G. Armytage, landed in
Sydney in 1813, and then went to Tasmania.
In 1836 he crossed to Victoria, in the brig
Henry, with a smattering of sheep, and
landed at Williamstown. He put his flock
with Judge Tedder’s, in charge of a son, T.
Armytage, who had been an articled clerk to
Gellibrand, the lawyer, compiler of Bat-
man’s famous truck with .lika Jika, the
alleged nigger chief. Gellibrand and one
Hesse went out exploring, and are still
missing. T. Armytage and party went to
look for them. Thev followed the Barwon
River west for 30 miles, where the tracks
were lost. Presumably Gellibrand and Hesse
were snatched up to Heaven. A policy of
£ll,OOO on Gellibrand’s life was paid, yet
there were rumors that that legal gentleman
had “gone nigger,” and was living in a nude
state among the Binghis. F. W. Armytage
lived at Woolomanata, near Geelong, till lie
moved to Como, South Yalta. Owned at
various times Mossgiel and Nocoleeehe, in
N.S.W., arid Norley, Thargomindah and
Ealbertie, in Queensland. Much interested
in frozen meat. With G. Fairbairn and H.
Cunningham he sent the first successful
shipment in 1879 by McEacharn’s steamer
Strathleven. Armytage owned most of the
cattle shipped. He married a daughter of
Staughton, of the Werribee. Three sons
survive.

Last year no less than seven
Australasian Anglican bishops,
who had handed in the gaiters
and . -o. shovel hat with the
rigging on it, were on the re-
tired list. The R.C. bishop
dies at his post, and when he is
buried his remains help to ele-
vate the surface of a continent
which is a great deal too flat in
its natural state. But the Angli-
can prelate mostly leaves his
job in his declining years and
goes to England. Last year
there were 35 retired Anglican gaiters from
various parts of the world, all above ground.
What the church wants in Australia is

but the remark 'Will bear repetition.
“C.A.8.”: Monsignor Carroll, who de-
parted for Paradise on the last day of Aug-
ust, had some ; quaint ways. He disapproved
thoroughly of the purse-of-sovereigns habit,
and never accepted a farewell bean from one
flock to help him on to the next. He was
absolutely Wowserish in his horror of love’s
young dream in dark places. About 30 years
ago, when in charge of Mount Carmel
parish, he arranged to have the evening de-
votions at four instead of seven, so that
the return of the worshippers should be
made in broad, unromantic daylight. On
another occasion lie organised a moonlight
picnic in aid of his church, which (Iho
picnic*) began at four o’clock and ended be-
fore -nightfall. He was a kindly old soul.
An objection was once lodged against an
aged member of his choir, who continued to
bray, though his voice had long departed.
Quoth the Monsignor cheerfully: “Oh, now.
now, we must be indulgent! Why, he sang

Ellis, who now hangs out in Mel-

might be expected in the case of

after the manner of most good
writers, never possessed the com-
mercial instinct, and how affluent
that is anybody may guess. It would
'greatly assist his later years if the
N.S.W. Labor party would pay him
the salary that has been owing to

By one who knew him: —
Only one thing could be said in serious disparage-
ment of the late Judkins as a plucky enemy .of the
gambling „apd .liquor law-breakers in Melbourne.
.He on one occasion accepted information Grom
Wren’s Tote, party which he used against. Sam
fGHlott, thereby serving the Wren purpose, which was
to intimidate Premier Bent by bringing .about an
.“exposure” of his ministerial colleague. A news-
paper published certain revelations concerning
Gillott and his city property at the same time that
Judkins delivered his sermon on the . same subject,
.the matter for both attacks being supplied to; both
parties by Wren’s agent whilst serving the scheme
of the Tote proprietor. Juddy didn’t diminish his
fury against the Tote, but in thus conniving with his
enemy, as it were, the little man cut a rather • mean
figure. Finally, the Tote was sun pressed, a resmt due
partly to the Judkins agitation. Also, Sunday
trading at the pubs was scotched, if not quite ex-
terminated, by the energetic moralist. The difference
between Jud and the common or prowling wowser
was very considerable. lie was a legitimate cham-
pion of Government moral law, rather than a canting
preacher of the social moral laws which are made
by hypocrites orily to be broken by sinners at large.
Even the genuine Wowsers are unpractical in their
snuffling demands for Reform. Judkins was the
practical reformer who did something, and the hand-
some cash testimonial which came to him on his
death-bed, when he could do no more, was largely
a public gift to a decent sort of Australian.
GENERAL WADE, V.C.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was a source of worry to the Liberal whip that
he could never catch the Caucus napping. Yet, when
the chance came yesterday—when a number of Gov-
ernment supporters had gone away to the races and
there was a possibility of putting the McGowen Min-
istry out of office, the position was blundered stra-
tegically.—Sydney Sun.
He folded his arms in the front of his benches ;
With eyes like the eagle (or was it the bat?)
He frowningly stared at the enemy’s trenches
And watched someone filtering talk through his
hat ;
Alert and alive as a mid-winter adder,
He waited his moment to sound the advance,
And send his brave men with guncotton and ladder.
Good General Wade had left nothing to chance.
Great siege guns of gas in his day-dream were bang-
ing ;
His strategist’s brow was all furrowed with
thought;
While gamely liis leaders were spouting and slanging,
Campaigns of the future were plotted and fought;
He brooded apart like a genius tremendous,
Whose scheming and planning had worked to a
close,
Just waiting around for the finish stupendous—
The abject surrender of hollow-cheeked foes.
And so the long day to its darkening wended ;
The frontal attack never faltered or died ;
But when kindly, Night on the riot descended,
Some private remarked in a frantic aside
That, while the bombardment of Wade’s dogged
forces
Was raising a dust and a wearisome din,
The gallant defenders were off backing horses
And General Wade could have marched his men in !
A knell for the hero expensively sleeping !
Twine cypress and poppies to make him a wreath !
In front of the fortress his vigil he’s keeping,
A mantle of utter abstraction beneath.
A prayer for the fallen, for gfeat is their tally,
And say a few more for the leaders who don’t!

valley,
Mayhap he will wake. But he probably won’t)

At latest advices the Australian Govern-
ment’s note circulation was £9,346.220. In Canada,
thanks to the method of requiring the banks to hold
a fixed proportion of their cash reserves in Govern-
ment paper, it is about £23,000,000, and yet
Canada, unlike Australia, allows the banks to issue
their own notes alongside the Government paper.
Probably if Australia adopted the Canadian idea, it
could raise another £10,000,000, and if it applied
even half of that to a sinking fund, it could start
redeeming the State debts at the rate of about
£175,000 a year, which, with compound interest,
would represent a wonderful amount of good money
made out of nothing before we are all dead.
The Freetrader who scoffs at the idea of
giving Protection to the little industry because it
employs for a start only three men and a boy, ought
to turn up the record of the Broken Hill Prop.
Twenty-six years or so back that concern began with
a small furnace, into which it emptied its surface
ores, mixed with foreign coke and a bit of lime-
stone scraped together from anywhere. The product
was silver-lead bullion, which was sent to America
for treatment. Then somebody got the idea that a
handy market was waiting for silver and lead in
China and India. A refinery was started at Port
Pirie, and W. R. Wilson took a spell from horse-
breeding to open up the trade with Asia. When the
refinery started it was found that the ore contained
enough gold to pay a lot of the expenses. Naturally,
Uncle Sam hadn’t mentioned anything about the
gold ; that sort of thing is one of the blessings of
Foreign-trade. After a while the furnaces were added to
so largely that it became worth while to develop the
coke-making industry in Australia. This is now a
big thing, and the production of valuable by-products
is gradually being developed. As the locally-trained
metallurgists got more experience, they wrestled suc-
cessfully with the underlying sulphide ore. Thus, the
production of zinc concentrates was started, and now
the zinc output is worth three times as much as the
silver output. The treatment of zinc resulted in the
discovery that eucalyptus oil was specially suitable
for the flotation process, and dozens of movable oil
distilleries are at work among the peppermint
scrubs of the baclcbloeks. Incidentally, thousands of
tons of sulphuric acid are produced from the sul-
phides, a portion of which goes in the manufacture
of artificial manures—another new and important
Australian industry. As the co.’s knowledge of zinc
metallurgy increased, the distillation of zinc (spelter)
was undertaken, and that meant the manufacture of
clay retorts in Australia. Now the B. H. Prop, has
two further developments in hand. First it proposes
to extract the zinc which has been run off with the
lead-smelter slags, and when that is done the residue
will be valuable for use as a flux. To feed the fur-
naces after the ironstone capping at the mine had
been exhausted, it became necessary to open up
ironstone quarries, and with the sulphide ore from
those sources it is now proposed to establish the
iron and steel industry. Iron, steel, zinc, gold, oil,
sulphuric acid, coke and by-products, with a valuable
lift to a dozen other industries —all began with a
little 30-ton pot, just over a quarter of a centurv
ago. And the Freetrader reckons that the little in-
dustry isn’t worth encouraging because it is little,
just as the baby isn’t worth bringing up because it
isn’t full-grown.

Like almost every other concern in the stock and
station business, this old-established N.S.W. co.
thought it saw a short cut to fortune by making
advances on pastoral securities. The borrowing
mania of the late ’Bo’s had made money so plentiful in
Australia, and credit was so easily secured, that prices
naturally boomed along just as they are booming
now. Then John Cowshusband and Sandy Mcßull
wanted their money back in a hurry, so the boom
broke and prices tumbled down among the wreckage.
In the struggle to pay interest on extravagant pur-
chases, country was overstocked. Just about that
time the rabbit curse began to cry aloud, and when
even a moderate drought looked in there wasn’t
enough feed for sheep and rabbits, so both lots died by
the million. Thus Pitt, Son and Badgery could not
find some of their securities when they went to look
for them, and a long struggle to make good the
losses ensued. The table shows the latter vears of
the struggle—no dividends and copious writings-off.
The next tahle shows how various items have moved
during the last 12 years:—
1900. 1909. 1910. 1911. 1912.
Overdrafts .. £55,741 £43,896 £17,311 £29,272 £16,354

Goodwill .. .. 25,000 Nil Nil Nil Nil
As late as 1900 advances, foreclosures, etc., amounted
to £87,087 ; by 1909, these were reduced to
£34,744. As the co. got out of its back country
securities, no doubt at written-down values, it put
the money into office, store, sale-yard and similar
accommodation in and about the city. This is all
lumped now at £129,156. The biggest items doubt-
less are city freehold and Flemington saleyards. The
former are no doubt good property; the latter are
more doubtful, owing to what the chairman referred
to as “the agitation in favor of the removal of the
yards, which is unnecessary, and the absolutely un-
warrantable expenditure by the Government of about
£200,000” —that is on the Homebush abattoirs, etc.
Nowadays the co. devotes its attention almost entirely
to the selling agency, and the slump in profits for
the year is due more or less to the shortage of sup-
plies, including the wool clip, the result of the
drought. Also, wool fell a trifle, and that means a
shrinkage in the commissions, which are on a per-
centage basis. Of the dividend shown for the past
year, Is. per share, or about 6 p.c., is a bonus. This
money is not actually paid out, as a call of Is. per
share is made at the same time. This brings the
shares up to 18s., leaving 2s. to be called. A total
of 6s. has been got in in this way during the past
three years.

The Sydney harbor passenger traffic is catered for by
four companies—two of them all gold, the other two
heavily alloyed. This is one of the other two. Serv-
ing a district getatable by tram from the city, it
some time ago thought it saw an escape from slow
starvation by pushing into the charter and picnic
business. In that connection it launched out into
fairly large purchases of harhor foreshores. The
struggle to pay interest on the big capital cost was
keen enough before the Federal land tax arrived.
After that, the directors began to look around for
buyers. By an extraordinary bit of luck they, like
other subdividers, have been favored by a Sydney
suburban land boom. Hence, as the directors put it,
since the termination of the half-year we have dis-
posed of the Pearl Bay property, at a figure that
will leave a very satisfactorv increase towards t li e
current half-year’s profits.” Pearl Bay is in Middle
Harbor, just inside the Spit. The co.’s other big
property is at Clontarf, where an excited person
tried to spill the Royal Edinburgh’s gore 43 years
f™.-. The co.’s paid capital is £30,000. Its lia-
bilities, £14,374. This money and the reserves
(which include £13,716 of share premiums) are
almost entirely represented by ship properties,
£45,685, and freehold properties, wharves, etc.,
£34,894. The profit and loss account bumps all
expenses, “including depreciation,” into one line.
Whether the amount written off is adequate or other-
wise, this paper can’t even guess. Consequently it
doesn t know whether the profits as shown in the
accounts are under or over the mark. They may

that depreciation is pretty liberally allowed for, so
the profits may be quite as good as they look.

Thomas Elder is dead these many years, and R. Barr
Smith, though happily still among the living, has
been long out of the management of this co., though
he still has by far the biggest individual interest
in it. The directors are, however, men who know as
much about the wool growing and pastoral mortgage
professions as the original partners did, which is to
say that nobody in South Aus. knows more. Elder’s
Wool and Produce Co. used to be in 20,000 shares
paid to £2 10s. each and liable for another £7 10s.
Gradually the vicious habit of shuffling wool, etc.,
into a bale, and sending it to Europe to be auctioned,
was abandoned in favor of local sales. This meant,
in many cases, the financing of the growers; conse-
quently the old Elder co. was metamorphosed, and
80,000 new £lO shares were issued, on which, for
many years, only £1 15s was paid. As the business
grew the prudent old gentlemen who run this con-
cern called up first 15s„ then 10s., and last year
another 10s. This makes the shares paid to £3 10s.
The past year’s 10s. call was got in on March 1; in
the table it is assumed that the whole of the new
£50,000 has earned dividend as from that date. A
good many pastoral cos., bitten by the rabbits,
droughts and other mischievous insects of the early
’9o’s, have been shy ever since of squatting advances.
Apparently E., S. and Co. are prepared to still risk
it. Anyway, as the next table shows, in addition to
“bills receivable and advances on produce shipments,”
the company has £1.898 750 represented by “other
advances, goods, etc.” Under almost any circum-
stances there would he considerable risk for share-
holders in this business, hut the risk in this case
is all the greater because the bulk of the necessary
capital is provided by outsiders, who will want 20s.

So far as the share capital is concerned, the risk is
of course greatly reduced through the fine reserves
that have been accumulated. Though the dividend
for the past year is just in excess of the amount laid
by, the total dividends for the past 11 years are
practically the same as the lav by—dividends
£250,625, lay by £248,631. And as the table
shows, a large amount of profit has also been written
off. This writing-off, shown in the table, is exclusive
of sums by which the premises and plant account has
been clipped down; £ 2534 went that way in the
past year. The co. is in a business where heavy
losses are liable to happen under anything but super-
human control, but the management appears to be
providing for risks wherever the ordinary human eye
can detect them.

Some of the remarks which The Bulletin made
six months ago about this concern’s dividend badly
want making over again, and the further increase
in the amount of the div. lends them emphasis. In
the first place the mortgage remains just where it did
at July, 1911. It isn’t the monster it once was, but
it still stands at £45,000. The last time a bit was
hewed off the incubus was when the paid-up capital
was raised from £lOO,OOO to £125,000, and there
is but a moderate amount of credit to be got by
paying off liabilities with fresh capital. It is much
more to the point to shift them out of earnings, and
to judge by the Mutual Store's great lack of liquid
assets there is no immediate prospect of doing much
that way. On July 31 the institution owed £1746
to its bankers, and had, to set against that, £l5OB
cash ( £l2OO of it in London). So it really had
no loose cash at all, the debit balance being £238.
Its other more or less liquid assets were accounts
owing by customers and others, £29,819 ; against
which the society owed £21,497 to creditors and
customers', and £329 for unclaimed dividends. It
had absolutely no investments apart from the busi-
ness (and, as already mentioned, the business carries
a £45,000 mortgage) ; and it had no cash except
what it owed to the bank. Also, out of the great
absence of cash at the end of the half-year, there
was the trifle of £6250 to be paid to shareholders.
A concern which is thus trading up to the last penny
of its capital and its borrowings isn’t justified in
paying 10 p.c. Its profits are certainly increasing,
but the dividends have increased so much faster that
the amount laid by this half-year is less than it has
been in any half-year since July, 1906. The re-
serves have grown, but they certainly don't seem to
keep pace with the needs of a growing institution.
It is hereby suggested that it should be made a cast-
iron rule that £2OOO a year be paid off the mortgage
out of earnings, even if the dividend has, for a time,
to be cut down one-half. The saving of interest
would make this method more profitable in the end,
especially as interest rates are on the up-grade.
When a concern which has its shop in pawn, and
which doesn’t seem able to shift a penny of the lia-
bility out of earnings, puts up its dividend eight
times in seven years, it is taking too many chances.
In a business of this sort, the most important
point is the fair valuation of the stock and plant.
As regards that matter, it is impossible to offer an
opinion. Hitherto the store has taken stock every
half-year, and has found the process costly. It now
proposes to take stock only once a year. The matter
is of no real importance; an annual stocktaking by
an experienced pessimist might be much better than
a half-yearly one by an optimist. And if the amount
saved is applied to the reduction of the mortgage,
the new method will almost certainly be an improve-
ment.

This is a company of long standing. It is nominally
aged 12 years, but it is a reconstruction and en-
largement of a previous concern which dated back to
1879, and that was, in its turn, a reconstruction of
a much older fire and life concern, which grew so
large that it split in three. Very rich, very re-
spectable, solid and fat is the Victoria. Business
comes to it by reason of its solid old name, and it
doesn’t need to get up a vulgar perspiration run-
ning after business. And it is a good class of
business, too, which surges in at its doors, hence the
gorgeous dividends. The Victoria doesn’t aim at
mere size with any great intensity, but to some
extent size has come to it, as shown in the following
figures:—

It isn’t half the business that might be done by a co.
with such a reputation had things been pushed, but
a trifle like that need hardly worry a body of share-
holders, whose 36 p.c. is fairly regular. The re-
serves are of the stone-front or large bow-waistcoat
order—almost entirely Government securities, real
estate, and fixed deposits in banks of the carefully
selected variety.

Somewhere about 11 years ago, when we were all a
good deal younger than we are now, this society had
an heroic wash-up, and wrote off half its capital, and
wrote down its assets, and fixed its old depositors for
five years on a 4 p.c. basis. The amount of capital
which disappeared in that calamity was not exactly
shown, but it was not far short of £50,000. Since
then a portion of the lost capital has re-appeared,
because property values have recovered, and proper-
ties have sold for more than their written down
value. These recovered amounts have been placed to
reserve fund ; in fact, out of the £15,133 added to
reserves between January, 1905, and July, 1912, no
less than £11,504 was merely a return of sums
previously written off. The directors were so lavish
with dividends that the amount added to reserves
out of current profits was hardly worth mentioning.
It is now proposed to restore some of the lost capital.
Each share of £2 10s. paid up is to be split into two
£1 shares fully paid, and one £1 share paid to 10s.
By a simultaneous 10s. call and 10s. bonus, the latter
share is to be made fully paid at the expense of
the reserve fund. This will reduce the reserve by
about £9560, and correspondingly increase the
capital.
Some further figures concerning the Standard
follow:
Julv, ’Ol. July, ’ll. Jan., ’l2. July, ’l2.
Liabilities ..£37,015 £35,877 £36,182 £42,244
Advances .. 19,998 80,388 95,486 105,317
Foreclosures . . 72,305 30,973 19,932 17,990
Cash, etc. .. 2,778 234 340 171
The position is very strong in one respect, inasmuch
as the shareholders’ funds represent nearly £79,000,
while the liabilities to the public are only £42,244.
Only the sort of slump that would arise through
an invasion by the Huns could push down values to
a point at which the depositors would be seriously
endangered. In another sense the position is rather
weak, inasmuch as, in the desire to incite business,
all the capital, the reserve fund, the contingency
fund, the deposits and a trifle of £2200 borrowed
from the bank have been shoved into advances.
Liquid assets are nil. So, if the depositors are
struck by the coming depression, and start to with-
draw heavily in order to buy boots for themselves, it
may become a case of realising securities rather more
rapidly than is profitable.

In February a “special dividend” of £4OBO was paid,
and, later, 4080 new shares at par were issued to
present holders, so really the new shares were a gift,
a slice being taken out of reserves for the purpose.
This proceeding raised the capital from £40,800 to
£44,880. In spite of the opposition of the Govern-
ment quarry, the profits continue to forge ahead,
with the boom, of course; but when the building
boom bursts, or fades a trifle, this co.’s profits, like
those of most construction cos., may come down to
earth with something dimly resembling a thud. The
possible horse-power of that thud can, to some extent,
be judged by the figures for 1905. However, even if
the next general slump is worse than the one of 10
years ago, this co. won't feel it nearly so severely,
being in a much better position to stand a knock.
Co. owns quarries at Guildford, Prospect and
Emu Plains, and for each ton of material taken out,
writes off a small sum ; so that, when the quarries
are worked out, the shareholders won’t be left with
a worthless hole in the earth carrying a large book
value. Quarries, plant and machinery stand now in
the books at £42,318, as against £41,823 12
months ago. In the meantime large additions and
improvements have been made, so it looks as though
quite sufficient is being written off. The next table
shows the progress of the co. in another direction:—

Liabilities.. .. ..£7730 £1,086
Liquid assets .. . . 4076 12,738

Sales of sand, gravel and blue metal have taken a
big jump during the half-year. As at December,
1911, the sales were £17,9i0. At June, 1912, they
were £24,054, an increase of £6144. But when the
bad times come, and pater familias isn’t so particu-
lar about the appearance of the garden path, and the
100 or so municipal councils can’t afford to repair
the roads, things won’t be so cheerful.

Bonus and dividends are, as usual, deferred till the
December half-year. The profits for the six months
show a big improvement, though big profits in a
co-operative concern don’t always mean good man-
agement. A co.. which shows a very small surplus
at the end of the year may be better managed than
one whose returns are very fat. In one case the
suppliers are given the highest possible price for their
produce: in the other, prices may be cut low to
swell the dividends. But this co. appears to be pretty
well managed. Commissions show a healthy increase
from £4057 to £4640 for the six months. Liabilities,
mostly amounts owing to suppliers, total £22,268;
and the principal assets are cash in hand £11,017,
and sundry debtors (amounts owing over the last
two weeks of the half-year—payments being made
fortnightly) £20,003. The capital, as is generally
the case in co-op. concerns, is very small, being only
£ 995 ; but the reserves are very solid, so the posi-
tion in that respect is safe.

The average profits for the past three years are a
good deal better than those of the first three in the
table, but not as much as they appear to be,
because the capital has been just doubled since 1900.
It now consists of £123,305 in ordinary shares and
£76,695 in preference, less a few pounds of unpaid
calls. Kaiapoi is one of the most highly reputed
woollen manufacturing concerns in Australasia, and
its products are popular. Yet it had to pay 61 p.c.
to get even preference capital, and after it has paid
that much, and a strictly moderate 7 p.c. to ordinary
shareholders, all that is left over could be comfort-
ably tucked into a vest pocket. Compared with
banking and other branches of pawnbrokery, the
manufacturing business has so far little gilt on its
gingerbread in these parts. Fortunately this co.
doesn’t now have to shoulder any vast amount of
debt, the new capital having been used to reduce
liabilities. The next table shows that aspect of the
matter and a few other things:—
1900. 1910. 1911. 1912.
Capital . . £lOO,OOO £150,715 £198,760 £199,940

Stock . . 118,388 139,847 149,342 154,379
By far the biggest asset is stock, which includes raw
materials. This item cannot be checked in any way,
and the management’s estimate has to be swallowed
whole. There have been such things as errors in
stock-taking, and investors have to risk that. This is
one reason why it is far safer to take a general view
of a few years’ profits than to go wholly on one year s.
The substantial amounts shown as written off have
been in reduction of property and plant book values.
The allowance for the past year was a shade over 4
n.c. —though vou don’t learn much from thnt. seeing
that freeholds, which may depreciate very little, and
nlant, whic'i may denreciate verv much, are tied up
in one bundle. However, the accounts leave a satis-
factorv impression, and manufacturers of this class
of goods have always the country’s growing disposi-
tion to use more of its own products running in
their favor.

The great advance made in the construction of In-
ternal Combustion Engines has now been further
demonstrated by the fact of Petrol, Benzine, Kero-
sene and heavy Oil Locomotives being brought into
daily and successful commercial use. The machines
are thoroughly reliable, and are cheaper in very
many instances than steam or electric locomotives.
Messrs. Ironside, Son and Dyckerhoif, of London,
have supplied a great number of their famous “New
Century'’ locomotives nearly all over the world, and
their machines are even working continuously and
safely in “gassy” coal mines. W. and J. Lempriere,

The year’s record by the Pioneer tin mine
at Bradshaw’s Creek (Tas.) reveals that Cecil G.
Evan tills in his solitude well. He always flirts out
some up-and-doing record, and this tune he lets
lie-ht into the reserves of the Pioneer and the new
Argonaut leases. Since 1900 the Pioneer has cut out
4 979 600 cubic yards of drift for 4333 tons of black
tin the average being 19501 b. per cubic yard. This
average compares with 15931 b. won for the past
year. Compare these figures with the reserves, which
total : Stream Tin
Cub. Yds. per Cub. Yd.
In the Pioneer .. 4,298,000 .9801 b.
In the Argonaut .. 1,142,600 .993 „
There is thus 5,440,600 cubic yards, averaging
9861 b. of stream tin per cubic yard to work. The
estimate is based on bores cut, but Cecil G. has
always been lucky in hitting the general average
with his drill. Of course there is a vast difference
in an average of .9801 b. per cubic yard and 1.9501 b.
obtained in the past from the Pioneer; but as
work goes down the lead a lot more drift has to be
handled. It is hardly possible that costs will drop
much below the last year's run of 4.971 d. per cubic
yard, but the installation of the belt conveyer may
help a bit that way. The Argonaut carries shallow
ground, running up to 12ft., and, therefore, should be
a cheap proposition. A lot of the drift is expected
to run to ljlb. of stream tin per cubic yard, and
balance should pan out at about 0.81 b., so that pro-
fits seem to be safe. The beauty of the situation to
the owners is that tin is wanted the world over, and
there isn't any new field rushing out supplies to
break the market. Last year’s work at the Pioneer
gave a gain of £55,510, or, deducting office expenses,
a net profit of £53,114. This, cut up at 4s. 9d. per
share in divs., allowed £5OOO to be written off
plant, £1915 to be paid for taxes, and enabled
£18,551 to be carried forward. Co. has £12,250
of liquid assets, and owes £5158, so that it won’t
perish over the attempt to equip the Argonaut. This
little table explains how the Pioneer has so prospered
of late years:—

Another mining engineer’s views:—

formation of the newer and larger company:—
lodide’s quarter interest
2400 fully-paids at £lO ..£24,000
1200 contributing at £2 .. 2,400
£26,400
Balance of payment (either in shares or
cash) to original owner of quarter-in-
terest. . .. . . . , . . . . 6,000
Purchase of remaining three-fourths in-
terest (in cash) .. .. .. .. 50,000

Total purchase price .. . £109,400
Nominal capital, 15,000 shares at £lO .. 150,000
Working capital .. .. .. £40,600
The quarter-interest of the old lodide Co. is thus
valued at £32,400, mostly in shares, while the three-
quarters interest is valued at £50,000 cash. Pro-
moter's cut is 2300 fully-paids and £4OOO cash.
From the published portion of Fawcett’s report the
following is to be gathered: The mine is shallow,
the bottom level being only 90ft. deep, with the
deepest winze, 20ft. below that. Ore is lead car-
bonate and free oxides of silver, with patchy gold
contents; gangue is silicious ironstone; width of
deposit not proved, as only the hanging-wall is de-
fined. Above the 60ft. level the ore is estimated to
be 12,500 tons, “worth, approximately, £8 per ton
gross value in lead, silver and gold.” Purchase of
the mine recommended as a sound mining venture.
Well, it may be. But there is not one solitary
assay given in the issued report, on which the public
are invited to apply for shares in the new company.
The size of the block of ore reserves isn’t mentioned
either, the only statement being that the 60ft. level
is 100 ft. long. The ore may extend to the grass
roots, or it may not; but even if it does, the block
would need to average 20ft. to 22ft. in width to give
the tonnage stated. Most, if not all, the work has
been done near the hanging-wall only, which appears
to be the richest side. The reserves are admitted to
be not “blocked-out,” i.e., exposed on four sides, but
in one magnificent sweep they are made out as 12,500
tons, averaging £8 per ton ; or, rather to be “worth”
that much, which might be interpreted by the un-
suspecting that the ore reserves are valued at
£lOO,OOO. What is their actual value? Cost of
mining and treatment, etc, is nowhere to be found,
but a line may be taken through the return from a
parcel that has already been sent away to Cockle
Creek. From 4000 tons of lode material 1280 tons
were sorted, and, according to the report, “netted
the sum of £9BOO, after deduction of railway freight
and all smelting charges.” Not a word about the
road freight, or the mining or the development charge.
To put the matter as favorably as possible, deduct
only (say) 15s. (too low to be realised) to mine the
4000 tons = £3OOO from the £9BOO, and the result
works out at a profit of 345. per ton of lode material,
which is the crude ore. Now, it is not at all likely
that the crude ore, yielding the picked parcel, was
any poorer than that left in the mine, and the
chances are that it was a good deal richer. But
allow that it was a representative sample. The block
of 12,500 tons would at that rate be worth £21,250.
It is true that lead has risen since the parcel was
sent, but the rise cannot be depended upon. And
there is nothing to prove that, in valuing the reserves
at £8 per ton, lead was not taken at the present
figure of well over £2O, for the basis of valuation
is also not stated. Anyway, there is a big difference
between £21,250 and the purchase price, leaving the
working capital out of the question. That the mine
is becoming poorer in depth appears to be indicated
by even the present shallow workings, as witness the
indirect testimony of the report. At the 90ft. level
there is a comparatively rich patch of ore, for 150 ft.,
valued at £6 Bs., but even so, it is suggested that
this ore should be concentrated to £9 or £lO per
ton by the rejection of half. This means leaving
£2 16s. to £3 16s. in each ton discarded, and is
pretty abundant proof that costs are exceptionally
high. It takes high-class ore to stand a 42 miles
journey by road and over 400 miles by rail, with a
stiff smelting charge waiting for it at the end of the
trip. The mine may be good, but not, on present de-
velopments, for £150,000.

The Junction North (Broken Hill) shows
some improvement in metal recoveries, particularly
8 * Its profits depend considerably on the nature
buying and selling contracts, particularly the
latter, for the J. North concentrates carry an unusu-
ally high proportion of zinc. The returns for
August were: —

31 507 55.7 32.6 14
For the four weeks 2094 tons of lead concentrates
were produced, containing 1134 tons of lead and
68,0340 z. silver, and, if present high prices are taken,
the gross value runs to £31,184 (lead £2O, silver
2s. 6d.). lor six months to the end of March, 8731
tons of lead concentrates were produced, containing
298,0000 z. of silver and 5764 tons of lead, also
2688 tons of 40 p.c. zinc concentrates. The output
of zinc concentrates is now in full swing—from 1200
to 1400 tons per month —and the zinc contents have
improved to 42 p.c. The most striking feature is an
increase in the production of silver in lead concen-
trates, which is now equal to 590 z. per ton of lead.

At Baker’s Creek mine (N.S.W.) stoping
has been started above No. 11 level on Smith’s Reef.
The drive is in 116 ft. The same reef has been driven
46ft. in No. 12 level, and the reef averages from 6in.
to 9in. thick. Forty-four tons of stone were crushed
from No. 3 reef for 50oz. of gold. Tributors made
a final clean-up of 36 tons for 2640 z. The manager
has nothing to say as to whether there is any pros-
pect of the Baker’s Creek co. obtaining any of this
rich stone. The fact that the co. had to make a call
while some of the tributors were crushing small lots
of stone worth from 7oz. to lOoz. per ton was gall-
ing. The sharemarket is anything but strong, and
there are probably some forfeited shares.

Q.E.D.: The Junction North S.M. Co. ap-
pears to be out of order in making the move it has.
In an exactly similar case, Bisgood v. Henderson’s
Transvaal Estates ([l9oB] 1 Ch. 743), Lord Justice
Buckley in the Court of Appeal (Eng.), the highest
court for dealing with such matters, gave this de-
cision: “In my opinion any attempt so to define the
constitution of the'co. as that the members shall in
an event be liable for a large sum, is a breach of
the Statute, and ultra vires. Any clause which Can
be used to maintain a scheme which imposes upon
a member the alternative of accepting liability
for a larger sum, or of being dispossessed of his
status as a shareholder upon terms which he is not
bound to accept, is, I think, ultra vires Also, the
J.N. has not yet gone into voluntary liquidation, nor
can it so long as it is in debt.
Harvey Patterson, of the Broken Hill Pro-
prietary, is an admirer of the big Iron Knob flux
quarry in S. Australia, which has already supplied
the Port Pirie smelting works with 680,709 tons of
ore. Cheap methods of transport have to some ex-
tent exploded the idea that the contiguity of iron
ore to coal is essential to cheap production of pig
iron. But cheap transport went hand in hand with
the steam-shovel mining of friable ore, large 40-ton
trucks, broad-gauge railways, and rapid loading and
unloading of steamboats. Low costs, for Obtaining
the raw material, and assembling the ore, flux and
fuel at the furnace are obviously essential. Assum-
ing that pig iron is to be produced at 50s. per ton,
and that ore from the Iron Knob will give a furnace
extraction of 66 units, it is evident that, if the cost
of carrying the ore from the mine to the furnace were
only 10s. per ton, it would still equal 30 p.c. of the
whole working cost on pig iron at 50s. per ton, for,
under the most favorable conditions, it would require
l'J tons of ore to produce a ton of pig iron. Ore of
50 p.c. grade would make the cost of carriage, at
10s, per ton, exceedingly burdensome. This isn’t
said to belittle the splendid deposit in S.A., but
simply to show that the contiguity of iron ore to
coal in N.S.W. or Queensland is an enormous advan-
tage.

The Grafton copper mine (N.S.W.) is
doing some prospecting in the hope of refreshing its
ore reserves. This mine names its levels alphabeti-
cally. “A” level has been driven a total of 1340 ft.
At 1320 ft. solid ore of good quality was passed
through, but very soon afterwards the ore channel
became considerably mixed. At the 1340 ft. mark the
ore commenced to make again, and 9in. of sulphide
was showing in the face. There are other places
that show encouraging prospects. The smelter treated
243 tons for the week, for a return of 34 tons of
matte, containing 14J tons of copper. A new bottom
was smelted into No. 1 furnace, which absorbed some
of the copper. This accounts for the return being
below the usual grade. For the previous week 115
tons were smelted for matte containing 11.3 tons
of copper.
* * * *
Mount David (N.S.W.) is opening the
shoot of stone discovered in its south-east level from
the new shaft. This was driven 75ft. from the
crosscut, and for a distance of 25ft. a good-looking
quartz vein was exposed, carrying gold. A winze
has been started, and the manager estimates the
stone shot up is worth 25dwt. per ton. Some years
since a good shoot of stone was opened from a winze
below the old workings, so there is a chance that a
still deeper shoot of payable stone may be dis-
covered from the new shaft.
Amalgamated Hill End (N.S.W.) had
such a good-looking run of quartz in Phillipson’s
north level that it seemed, while the driving was
going on, highly probable that the good stone would
extend upwards for a considerable distance. But a min-
ing “certainty” very often is, after all, only a sport-
ing chance, and Phillipson’s reef is an instance, for
the rises and stopes Over the level show an erratic
reef of variable size and value. It is quite possible,
though, that the good stone met with in the level
may extend downwards, but that remains to be
proved. The present outlook is overcast because of
the erratic nature of the vein overhead.
Brilliant St. George (Charters Towers)
closed its half-year with a credit of £2538. Stoping
has been carried out on the vein of stone (a cross
reef with a north and south trend) at the 1450 ft.
level. This vein varies from 3in. to 18in. in thick-
ness. Fifty-seven tons crushed at the rate of £9 3s.
per ton, but the profit was only £220. Costs are
very heavy. This co. has recently crushed another
50 tons for £9 11s. 9d. per ton. No. 6 level ap-
pears to have a fair chance of picking up this cross
reef. There are 144,000 shares.
* * * *
Brilliant Extended (Charters Towers*
made a profit of £lOB4 last month, which is an
improvement for the previous return, which only
gave £266, and before that the Extended was making
a loss. Last month 2740 tons were crushed, and
2700 tons of tailings cyanided. The total yield was
£5BlB.
* * * *
Brilliant Blocks (Charters Towers) has
not succeeded in cutting the footwall reef worked by
its neighbor, the Brilliant Deeps. Its crosscut is in
a northerly direction from the shaft, and is in more
than 600 ft., so is beyond the estimated distance. The
Deeps, next door, found some difficulty in picking up
this footwall formation in their No. 2 level, and it
was only after sinking some distance that the vein
of quartz opened out. The Deeps estimate that they
have 300 ft. of backs above No. 4 (2540 ft.). Brilliant
Blocks is, however, encouraged by the fact that No.
4 level took a south-westerly trend, and has conse-
quently been approaching the Blocks’ boundary at an
angle. The chance of striking the reef at the 2000 ft.
level depends very considerably on the point along
the boundary cut by the crosscut. Shoots of payable
stone alternate with blanks.
* * * *
At Croydon (Q.), Viles’s Block crushed
691 tons for 12020 z. of gold ( £2 14s. 2d. per oz.).
This makes the crushing worth £3255 ( £4 4s. per
ton). A dividend of 3d. per share ( £600) has been
declared. Cuthbert’s Content is crushing 400 tons of
stone.
* * * *
The O.K. (N.Q.) is getting busy in its effort
to find the fortune which it reckons the old improvi-
dent co. didn't look for too earnestly. The water is down
to the 200 ft. level, and is expected to be all out in
a week or two. Trouble is being handed out with
acid water, bad gases and collapsed workings. The
80ft. level is completely blocked with fallen ground.

The Mount Oxide Options, after passing
on its large baby to the new company, has another
prospective entrant for the beauty show. An option
has been secured over a tin-bearing area at Stannifer
(y.), reported to be rich as well as large, carrying
21b. of tin to the yard.
* * * *
High lead and zinc prices are responsible
for a re-trial of the Lady Duff, at Stannary Hills
(Q.). A local syndicate is now working the show.
A 50-ton parcel has been sent to the Chillagoe smelters,
and a weekly output of similar tonnage is expected.
The lode is said to be 25ft. to 30ft. wide, where
worked at present, and outcrops a long distance on
the surface. Ancient history says the ore used to
average somewhere about £lO, but it took more than
this to cover the freight alone before the construction
of the Cairns railway.
* * » *
Hampden-Cloncurry (Queensland! main-
tains an average of 12 p.c. copper. It smelted 3750
tons for 454 tons of blister, containing by estimation
450 tons copper, 1640 z. gold and 58740 z. silver.
The ore is mostly silicious at the Duchess, so a tram
line is being pushed out to Mount Sylvia ironstone
quarry to facilitate the hauling of fluxes. Some of
the so-called pyritic ore in the Oloncurry district
contains a lot of silica, so it isn't true to its name.
Calcite (containing lime) occurs in some of the
mines, notably in the Great Australian, but generally
there is an excess of silica, so that large quantities
of barren flux have to be used.

Croydon (Q.) is the most northerly gold
field in Australia, and its better half, the Golden
Gate, is so flat and sandy that Mulligan, the veteran
prospector, expressed his surprise at the discovery
of a rich reef in a “swamp.” There are other sur-
prising things about Croydon, for the gold is usually
heavily alloyed with silver. Cuthbert’s Content
mine crushed 1686 tons for 57320 z., but the crush-
ing was only worth £9246, so in this instance the
“gold” was worth under 355. per oz. Costs, includ-
ing development, ran away with £5794, leaving a
balance of £3452.

Amalgamated Monkland and Glanmire
(Gympie) continues to sink in search of black slate
floors. To a depth of 'lo7sft. no great thickness of
slate had been met with. The black color is sup-
posed to be due to carboniferous or organic matter,
originally deposited when the slate was formed. This
carbon of black slate appears to enrich any reef that
may pass through it, so at Gympie nothing is ex-
pected unless the dark-colored slate is met with.
The Great Northern, a gold mining con-
cern in the Warning Finger of N.Q., seems to have
lost its teeth and grown to pension age. Its latest
effort was a 48-ton crushing, which took nine weeks
to get out, and the result was 91oz. odd. A few
men—mostly in pairs—are scattered among the levels,
but the results would hardly raise a shout, even of
drinking water. No. 4 north level has a 4ft. reef,
which is as hungry as a Domain beer-hum. Still, it
used to hold its head very high. Its last dividend
was a ss. one on 10,000 shares, which brought its
total dividend score to £1 17s. on £1 shares. But
its last bit of profit dividing was done seven years
ago, since when the concern has grown a “down-at-
the-heels” appearance.

The Federal reward lease (160 acres),
situated 25 miles N.W. of Oloncurry (Q.) has been
sold to W. Orr for £6OOO. This lease was men-
tioned in the warden’s report as a hopeful prospect-
ing proposition. While under option considerable
work was done just above water-level, and 30 tons of
ore assaying approximately 40 p.c. copper were ob-
tained. * Some hundreds of tons of high-grade ore
have been shipped from this claim during the past
four years. Oloncurry has not shown any conclusive
sign that large bodies of payable ore exist below
550 ft.
* * * *
Waihi (Maoriland), after producing
£9,997,266, is in trouble over its mine, which has
been idle for 17 weeks, partly because of a labor
dispute and partly because the ore reserves have
been seriously depleted. The hydro-electric power
scheme has been suspended in order not to draw too
heavily on the reserve fund, which, after deducting
£BO,OOO for electric power, stood at £90,000. In
Maoriland, 367 shareholders, holding 30,455 shares,
are in favor of investing money in other mines, while
173 shareholders, representing 15,195 shares, are
against the proposal. Possibly, an amalgamation
with the Waihi Grand Junction is in the air, for the
latter has shown improved form, just when the future
of the Waihi itself became overcast. The hydro-
electric scheme, instead of helping the co., became
a burden. In 1910 Waihi shares were skied up to £lO.
They are now down to 355., and the 2s. dividend
doesn’t help Waihi out of the slough. In 1910, be-
fore the big slump, 450,689 tons of ore returned
£926,100, but since then the returns have gradually
dwindled. The past is glorious, but the prospects
for all the Waihi mines are speculative.
* * * *
Woodlark Island (Papua) is showing bet-
ter form as a reefing field. The Woodlark King, for
six weeks, put through 128 tons for 1198 oz. An
average of over 9oz. per ton isn’t bad from a reef
that measures 3ft. wide in the sink. Another crush-
ing of 60 tons, put through Slater’s mill, averaged
15dwt. per ton. There are other ' good shows on
Woodlark, and the battery at Bushai is at present
crushing good stone. The Rulamadau mine, for a
run of six weeks, crushed 1463 tons and cyanided
1000 tons, for a total return of £lB3O. Nothing is
said about profit, and as a 2d. call has been made,
the co.’s finances probably show considerable lee-
way.
* * * *
Poseidon Alluvial (Vic.) got its new issue
of shares off like hot cakes. Finances are now lev-
elled up, though there will have to be another call
or two before dead work is done with and the lead
tapped from the new shaft. Still, the word goes
round that the right crowd intends to flutter the
flag over the show. What haps it then so long as
dealing is lively and a new market counter pro-
vided. All the Poseidon has done so far has been to
prove a rich, narrow run of wash and a rippling bow
of water. This was in the top part of the lease.
Now the gamble is whether the same values exist
in the main gutter or if the claim is a squib.
Groat Southern, Butherglen (Vic.), is
reminding all and sundry that the field still has a
kick left in it. The day was when the Chiltern
Valley and the Great Southern chased one another
on the dividend list. But the Chiltern Valley is
practically moribund, and so manager Thomas, in
the rival show, has been left to whip his claim into
vitality. A patch of 3090 z., as the result of three
days’ work, has helped him on the job, and, coming
on top of the previous higher average returns, gives
a bit in hand to the Great Southern Board towards
a Christmas box. In the south workings the gutter
makes towards a tributary, and this may be helping
.yields. As the co. has only a short length of the
lead at the end of the mine, enrichment is needed to
the north in order to keep up the returns.

Capt. Teddy Aides is off from Melbourne
to Asia again to land another big tin god. He goes
to pick up the Henzai Basin, which has hung heavily
on the hands of a Melbourne crowd for more than
a month or two. The genial Teddy pledges his bank
balance to put up a dredge, to cost a modest
£20,000, should he elect to pouch the property.
One or two Melbourne mining experts tell tall yarns
about the claim, so everyone counts on Teddy clinch-
ing a deal. The ground has a newly-fledged neighbor
with an unpronounceable name. That, too, has been
floated off with the aid of Sydney and Tasmanian
tin men, who are represented by Jammy Pratten
and Palfryman. Teddy is credited with having a
finger in that pie also.
From all accounts, a rude awakening
awaits the Melbourne co. recently formed to make
money out of the old Augusta, at Laverton (W.A.).
The shoot in the property has only the length of
half the width of George-street, Sydney, and as
practically all that can be seen of it has been rooted
out and development neglected, the 10-head mill
now in course of erection is apparently being in-
stalled to treat ore which the co. hasn’t got.
Shareholders are advised to look into things.
* * * *
Hope’s Hill, at Southern Cross (W.A.),
is now earning a bit of money for a party of work-
ing miners. Years ago some £32,000 was won by
a company. Then the shoot of gold began to show
a serious falling off in value, and gave such poor
results that the show was closed down. Trouble-
some sulphides are also said to have hastened the
demise.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, September 9, 1912.
My Dear Arini.—
The G.-G. Denmans came back from their
Queensland jaunt with healthy shins of pale
tan and ecstatic memories of “cutting out”
beasts with crumpled horns and flaring in-
dignant eyes at Malvern Downs. Ma-
genta, the property of the Fairburn
Pastoral Co. (the Fairburns own land
about the size of a large English county),
where the Denmans also rested the soles
of their riding boots, has a palatial home-
stead and the usual absentee landlords.
Manager Charles Maclean, in charge, and
Mrs. Mac (she was a Miss Hood, of Bris-
bane, with a youngish uncle well known as
Polo Hood) made the welkin ring and the
domestic board groan under the fatted beast
for the vice-regal visit. Magenta, by the
way, is mostly a sheep walk on the fringe
of cattle country. The Gee-Gee and the
Nutting were up by the light of the
morning star to gallop over to Logan
Downs (another Fairburn property) in re-
cord time —a 60-mile sprint. They spent the
remnant of the day swallowing the cham-
pagne air Outback, buying ponies, etc., and
trotted back next morning. If the viceroy
had been born earlier and in a different
station of life, he should have made a good
Mahratta or Pindaree, or a fine recruit for
Sim Bolivar’s cavalry.
During the recent Denman exodus to the
Northern State, Don Walter de Barttelot de
Gee-Gee and his tall, fair lady stayed on
the outer brink of bricks and mortar, some
miles beyond the palm trees of Brisbane.
The Collins homestead was the place. Here
they became so firmly rooted to the soil as
to become quite good imitations of the in-
digenous article. The Barttelots tore them-
selves up by the roots to hurry back, that
they might shed a farewell tear in the sor-
rowful House of Eviction, in Sydney.
From about 200 miles west of Rockhamp-
ton to any spot under the sunset (Q.) the
squattocracy in skirts has now taken seri-
ously to the ride astride. The Denman
lady set the fashion about three weeks ago,
and I hear the old leather-horned offence is
being torn out by the roots, and orders for
the long gentlemanly jacket and etceteras
are falling on local tailors like leaves in a
westerly gale. For rough bush tracks, with
the frequent and treacherous log under their
horses’ hoofs, bushwomen often used to do
by stealth the ride astride, which they now
perform under the public eye, as the correct
balance of power. For some years women
have practically admitted that they have
legs, so that some of Mrs. Grundy’s ancient
horror at the thought of a female form safely
poised in the centre of the saddle, instead
of dangling yards of habit on one side of
her sweating beast, is passing into the place
of forgotten follies.
“You are soon to have in your midst,”
scribbles an earth-tramping friend, “aviator
Busteed as an instructor in the art of flying.
He is most successful, and handles his
machine like a magician. I trusted my only
girleen to his care for one flight, and never
felt nervous for a moment as they floated
into cloudland.”
Mayor Clarke has called a meeting in the
vestibule of Sydney Town Hall for Monday
afternoon, September 16. The cause is the
proposed new institute for shellbacks in New-
castle. Afternoon-tea and musical items will
be used as levers to support the charitable
when they hand out a coin or promissory
note for the new building, through which
the rising tide will not burst into the even-
ing hymn. Governor Chelmsford, Sea Field-
Marshal King-Hall, his Washup of New-
castle and a few important clerical gaiters,
including his Anglican Legs of Sydney, will
heave their sympathy at the meeting - .
A London correspondent remarks : “I saw
Miss Elizabeth Jenkins, formerly of Roslyn
Gardens Kindergarten College" (Sydney),
imbibing deep draughts of learning from
various scholastic conferences here. She
also hovered on the rim of the Eugenics
gathering, which drew together a wonderful
assortment of thinkers who thought in
several languages.”
Invitations have been out for a week or
two for the wedding of Miss Constance
Drummond and Captain Bruen, R.N. Sep-
tember 14 is the date. The Admirable King-
Hall and his lady are in charge of the festive
gathering at Admiralty House. This is to
be the champagne postscript to the legal
sailor’s knot, which is to be tied in the Dock-
yard Church, Garden Island.
For the final farewell hop (October 4),
given by the popular Denmans in October,
guests are requested (unofficially) not to
wear black-edged swords, or cocked hats at
half-mast.
Danish . Consul Marcher, who has been
anchored in this port for many years, is off
to his native Jutlarid, in a fortnight or
thereabouts.
Six feet four inches of elongated humanity,
named Broome P. Smith, F.R.G.S.. recently
blew into this town from West Africa, and
adjacent mosquito-bitten wilds. Smith is
loaded to the Plimsoll mark with lantern
slides, and may lecture to White Austra-
lians on black missions and similar heathen
diversions.
Miss Ilka Marich has decided to wear her
orange blossoms on October 2, in St.
Philip’s Church. The groom-to-be is Mr.
A. E. Forster. His mother, by the way,
has given the bride-elect her blessing and a
dashing motor-car. Ilka is a popular
maiden, and the eldest daughter of tlie well-
known music-warehouse magnate, P. F.
Marich, of this Babylon or hutch.
. A correspondent sends an infuriated scrap
from a remote waterside suburb: “Is it a
fact that the Attorney-General’s wife, Mrs.
Holman, is getting four guineas a day as
expenses for her forthcoming inquiry into
the state of Mrs. Britannia’s cottage loaf?’.’
Better ask Mr. Holman.
The fierce, hard fist of coincidence recently
smote artists Joe Wolinski and Bruce Rob-
ertson in the same place—the doorstep of a
picture show. In 1910 the Australian
brushers bumped into each other near the
front latch of the Royal Academy (Lon-
don). Wolinski, with some of his wares under
one arm. presumably smiled the perky smile
of one who then had a picture hung on the
sacred R.A. walls, the season being in full
bud. A week or so ago they met again—same
kind of bump —before hanging day at the
R.A. Society’s rooms, Sydney. Mutual re-
clamations. Robertson’s etchings mostly
have a Scotch accent, and a warm brown
complexion. The National Gallery has
bought two of these reminiscences of his 15
years of wanderings in foreign climes.
Sydney’s ex-Mayoress Allen Taylor got
away with a diamond fence or tiara for her
hair the other afternoon. Lady Chelmsford
handed over the glittering bauble on the
part of a number of Sydney committee
dames, who took this method of expressing
their burst of gratitude. Though ex-Mayor-
ess Taylor was rough and ready in her rule,
she had a capable grip on the business of
every charity meeting, and she managed the
Orphans’ Smallclothes Association, and such
like, with a mailed fist (a la Kaiser William)
when necessary. Also, when opposition
arose, she could be a foe in shining armor.
(This is also from Kaiser William, and it all
arises from the fact that I incautiously ate
some Frankfurt sausage yesterday.) Her
ability for flogging together the loose ends
of disjointed chatter that dribbled away the
time of a committee meeting was never dis-
puted. The sensitive Squirmed under the
vigorous rounding-up of the large municipal
lady, but the business in hand was pushed
into the right place. Charities of every
brand of religious belief were very glad to
pocket fat cheques as the indirect results
of the City Mother’s stern “Be quiet, you
women!” The ex-Mayoress handsomely
earned a public recognition of her good,
though somewhat loud, works.
Private Sec. Vernon, of the G.-G.’s staff,
is alleged to be an amateur mummer of some
size. He is also suspected of a strong lean-
ing to writing playlets or curtain-raisers by
the stealthy light of the midnight gas-jet.
One Cecil Leys, whose parent edits the
Auckland Star, is snatching a spring holi-
day in this sea-girt city or partial Venice of
N.S.W.
Star-lady Mary Proctor was the guest of
the Pioneer Club on Friday afternoon. In
this exclusive haunt, dedicated to the por-
traits of ancestors who did something for
themselves or for this yriung country, and
did for themselves with considerable cash
success, modern cakelets and tea of five
minutes’ brew, appeared for Mary’s benefit.
(N.B.—A scoffer wants to know why a
pioneer cake or ancestral sandwich didn’t
grace the feast.) The Pioneer Club, having
presented the starry visitor with a waratah
and some yellow-cheeked primroses, retired
into dignified oblivion, and asked the lady
to favor them with a few stellar observa-
tions. After doing her best endeavor to
dodge the heavenly “shop,” Mary got to the
end of her chat, and was asked to get back
to where she started from and side-track the
Milky Way, or something of the kind. So
Mary, under her best hat, pursued the South-
ern Cross before the anxious eye of the
Pioneers and their canvas ancestors.
Mrs. Essie (Jenyns) Wood sends a glow-
ing foreword about her new home in Surrey
(England), and the garden that is going
to bloom under the hand of Kelway. “It
is on the summit of Kingston Hill, 25min.
by car from London.... from my bedroom
window in the moonlight I can see the fal-
low deer feeding in Richmond Park....”
Coming back to mere mundane shows, after
trailing a poetic pen across tall Canterbury
bells, buttercups and daisies in the early
morning dew, Mrs. Essie lets herself down
gently on to the tourney at Earl’s Court:
“It proved to be more of a society function
than anything else.” We know that kind of
entertainment here, at which the ;f alleged
quality of the guests is more swollen than
the cash receipts. “In my party were Marie
Corelli, Mr. Alex. Wilkinson and daughter
Ly 01....”
Mrs. George-Cornwallis West organised
the tourney. Queen Alexandra peeped out
of one of the towers, and serene highnesses
of every rank —solid silver and merely
electro-plate—were perched high above the
blast of trumpets from the vocal tubes of
armor-clad knights. Lady Dudley and her
eldest daughter, the handsome Honor, were
amongst the farthingales and ruffs present.
The Princess I’less, though not the Queen
of Beauty (this golden apple was reserved
for her high and mightiness of Curzon),
dazzled the male vision, riding on a charger
wreathed in crimson roses, with a haughty
train of princes and hereditary blue-blooded
grand dukes prancing on their serene saddles
in the rear. When society had admired
itsplf for some hours, it retired to dance
till the early morning milk foamed on the
Court’s back doorstep, and the early morn-
ing cat came home surreptitiously via the
scullery window from a garish night on the
chimney pot.
The Anglo-Indian, whose health wants
letting out to a temperate climate for repairs,
is said to be getting his foot on to Westralian
sod in considerable numbers. Usually he is
a desirable immigrant, with a pension, a
devilled liver, and a penchant for curried
bones and pith helmets. Something like
200,000 Westralian acres are said to be
passing in small to medium land-hunger lots
to the ex-Indian official.
When the average elderly Anglo-llelmet or
Indo-Pugr-aree (by the way, I stop here to
remark that once, in the long ago, a Hindu
university is said to have held long discus-
sion as to which was the oldest war-cry,
“Erin-go-bragh” or “Indi-go-bloo”) retires
from the Indian sun to the bleak air of, say,
a terrace house at Clapham or Bloomsbury
Square, his death rate is sudden and satis-
factory to the Pension Department. But
ex-sahib Tiffin, with the ingratitude of his
tribe, has discovered that the genial warmth
of Australia prolongs his life to an inde-
terminate old age. Instead of dying in his
native. Cold Land, he basely lives here on his
Imperial pension. Hence the sulky smile of
the Pensions Paymaster on the shores of the
Thames, near Barking and adjacent to Peck-
ham Rye. ,
The long and joyous A.D.C. Burnham
was steeped in private theatricals, till he
bounded off to golf in an adjacent State.
When he rebounds he’ll hunt round for the
name and address of the charity which “The
Importance of Being Earnest” is going to
finance. October 2 is the date. At present
two able-bodied civilians have vainly tried to
drag the inner meaning of his mumming
from the careless Burnham, who only knows
that it’s in aid of lost children, or lost ball,
or lost memory, or lost something or other.
(Lost Government House does get on its
inmates’ nerves.) As a matter of fact, the
show is for “‘The Ministering Children’s
League,” and the place is the Standard
Theatre. A.D.C. Curwen, from the Gov-
ernor Fuller kindergarten (Vic.), is
going to lend his aid to the charity show.
Miss Dorothy Luscombe, the tall and
straight, and Miss Ruth Lumsdaine, another
good-looking damsel, will also support the
Burnham play-acting. Montague Stephen
is reported to be almost professional' in his
part.
The Australian Wild Flower Show, organ-
ised by the Girls’ Realm Guild in this town,
will open its petals on September 26. The
Town Hall rafters will roof exhibits from
every State in the Commonwealth.
Curator Maiden, of the local Botanic
Garden patch, is lending his learned- aid to
the historic vegetation section of the coming
flower show. Australian floral mummies, in
good preservation (gathered by Joseph
Banks and Solander, on the primeval shores
of Botany Bay), will take an airing during
the progress of the event. ’ These ghosts of
the past were ’sent to England, arid after-
wards hunted back to their native land to be
secured under official lock and key. Leich-
hardt’s expedition to the interior will be re-
presented by some botanic wraiths with
phantom leaves. Tassy’s verdant isle sends
along a large consignment of wild flora. Port
Darwin contributes a water-color sketch or
two of its aboriginal blootiis- —a warm blaze
of tropic beauty. Queensland tourist bureau,
with a keen eye to business, is advertising
its luscious native fruits. Westralia is, hur-
riedly rushing into competition with its
amazing wild flowers. Mrs. Ellis Rowan
once stalked these gorgeous blooms with ant-
like industry. N.S.W. has already, through
her medium, a bowing acquaintance with
vivid patches of purple and yellow on beds
of dusty red earth under skies of gold and
amethyst.
The. port of Newcastle in'this State- is
beginning to clamor for a new Seaman’s
Institute. Apparently it has some cause.
The following hair-lifting description culled
from a Newcastle paper, was written in
July last by two officers of the s.s. West-
minster. “After spending weeks in a
Russian port on the confines of civilisation
(etc.)....we attended service at the Sea-
man’s Mission on Sunday evening last.” I
pass over various details of the Rev. Haire’s
cruise.on a wet Sunday in search of a con-
gregation, and boil down the climax. “We
arrived very wet, but glad to see a fine
assemblage of young rrien from the shipping in
the harbor.. . . .The rain was driving con-
tinuously through the doors and windows
and running in streams over the Institute
floor. When the tide rose higher, the floor
commenced to heave up with every sea that
rolled underneath, and fountains of water
spurted up through the holes eaten by rats/’
A harrowing description of the riotous con-
duct of the whole Seaman’s building, which
staggered up and down and round about its
moorings, and was generally so unseaworthy
it ought to have scuttled, completes this
deep-sea wail.
The R.A. Society has just added to its
show (Vickery’s Chambers) a line collection
of medallions and statuettes by a clever Aus-
tralian, named Dora Ohlfsen. This artist
and sculptress has been flitting between
Dome and I’aris for some years, and is
soon on the wing again. Her work is a
whole staircase or so above the average.
Plaster, bronze and white metal are her
materials. The faces, mostly in profile,
stand out in bold outline. They are, in the
majority of cases, foreign faces—stiff, mili-
tary gentlemen, very trim about their beards
and high in the collar, and Italian ladies
with a coronet or other high-class earmark
tucked away in the corner of their medal-
lions. A plaster relief, “The Awakening of
Australian Art,” suggests the idea that
though Art (a graceful nude with a well-
grown sun rising behind her) is rather thin,
she is lithe and full of vital energy. A shep-
herd droving his flock, a bronze medallion
of Mary Anderson and some Roman beauties,
are clever enough to be snapped up on sight
by Those Who Know. A delightful, though
rather sulky flapper, “Marthia” (Rome), is
obviously troubled about many things, but
not about her family crest, which is ram-
pant in one corner of her medallion. The
Dora Ohlfsen style is cold, sharp in detail,
and almost perfect in technique.
The Women Painters’ Show, a young
and hardy annual, will trim the R. A. Soci-
ety’s walls in October. Members are at pre-
sent swathed in working overalls, and pursue
the oily way behind wind-proof studio walls.
I mention the wind, which has been westerly
and prevalent in these parts for some days,
in italics. It has torn the female temper to
shreds by removing spring millinery off the
person of the wearer at the rate of 60 miles
an hour. Like the ancient Hebrews, we have
rent our garments. Worse still, we have
rent our best hat. Sometimes after being
blown off a sivift dog got it, and when last
seen the animal was fleeing with his mouth
full of hat arid barks.
Florence Rodway is ankle-deep in pastel
portraits of young children for the coming
exhibition of petticoat brushes. A small sub-
ject taking a breathless bite out of a piece of
toffee or other toothsome bribe, while the
artist removed her eye for one moment, was
a breezy snapshot for the camera that wasn’t
present the other afternoon. Bernice
Edwell, caged high up against the sky-line,
is hard on the trail of the miniature. The
work of some well-known Swedish women
painters may pass the Wilson’s Promontory
lighthouse in time for the October oil-and-
water rally.
Artist Blamire Young is said to have sold
£6OO worth of mist and moonlight effects at
his recent exhibition in this city. Hans
Heysen, the Adelaide man who gets a golden
sunstroke through his glowing bush idylls,
is reported to be too busy to look another
commission in the eye for at least 12 months.
Art, judging from these and other signs arid
wonders, may be said to be looking up in
this continent. The influx of Longstaff last
year, followed by the Bunny raid on the
cheque-book of the Pelf-made man, may have
excited the parochial market. The local oil-
tube is bulging out to better results, any-
how, whatever the first cause may be.
The British public is turning round to bite
the hand of one of its oldest and most ivy-
clad traditions —a fatted calf of a tradition
which grew up on the premises and played
with the children. It used to believe that
the. more venerable anything was, from a
lyric tenor or a bottle of wine to the heredi-
tary indigestion of the Tweenwayes family,
the better it was bound to be. So long as
the public favorite had enough strength in
his legs to totter to his front strip of plat-
form. the senile decay that, ate up his vocal
chords was regarded as a passing weakness.
To-day new favorites at Covent Garden are
pushed to the front by powerful patrons
every season. This year an Italian tenor,
Martinelli, was the darling of the duchesses.
McCormack, however, had conquered the
press and public. Critics who used to carp
admitted the upward leap of the burly John,
and the favorable influence of the Australian
season on his stage manner. John was
booked for “Tosea” with a young and radiant
soprano, Agostinelli (another new favorite
just chipping the applause off her first sea-
son in London), as the anguished heroine.
The typhoid germ, or whatever wild beast it
was, hit McCormack below the belt (at least
a large and ravenous-looking animal was ob-
served trying to climb on his bed, and though
it fled into the darkness when assailed with
the fireirons, some people, who got a hurried
back view of it, said it was a germ). So
Martinelli had the great opportunity.
The “Ave Maria” (with ’cello and fiddle
obligato), composed by May Summ'erbelle.
with its long-drawn “A —men” at the close,
is an acceptable addition to sacred song
portfolios.
May the Fates be good to you, my Arini,
VANDORIAN.

Think of it—a recital by the man who never knew music,
who couldn’t play a note, who doesn't realise what a clef

Chopin or Sousa!

is transformed into a splendid pianist —a special dispensa-
tion is granted, from all study, from all exercises.
No longer a foreigner to music, no longer an alien in the
land of melody or a stranger to harmony—for you can play the
Pianola

home. Make the treasured concert an
always-to-be-enjoyed affair. Place your-

for you. Glance at the suggested pro-
gram shown above. You can play the
most difficult compositions Avith the grace

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, September 9, 1912.
My Dear Yarrie, —
Wattle Day painted the town yellow on
Saturday and Monday. Saturday excursion-
ists raided the wattle groves close to Mel-
bourne, and straggled back to the city in
detachments clasping branches of the
national flower. On Monday, matrons in
command of squads of girls held up the com-
mercial world in the name of sweet Charity,
- the youngest sister of the three, but, accord-
ing to Scripture, much more important than
Faith and Hope. Mrs. Forrest, an ardent
lover of Australian flowers, was in the van
of the celebrations. She has a suite of
rooms at the Grand, and «o many helpers
descended on her quarters that the manage-
ment gave them a quarter of the tall build-
ing, and a side door all to themselves. Dinner
was laid in the board-room for the tired
workers.
The Royal Agricultural Society has spent
thousands since last year on its grounds,
ihe paths have been altered, and the grit
that gets into one’s eye is of a distinctly finer
quality than of old. Another large stand
has grown up, and the society promises a
sequence of new stands till, in due course, a
vast amphitheatre will form and help to
block the winds that rage over the grounds
from the north. Though laggard, hitherto,
in regard to tree-planting, something is being
done this year.. Poor little gum trees, two
or three feet high, cower inside wire-netting
cages.
New brick pavilions gladden the Agricul-
tural Show Grounds in place of the unstable
tents of past years, and the indoor exhibits
are, in consequence, better displayed. There
is a special new building expressly for show-
ing women’s work. This year it was filled
with jam jars, and glass cases of pallid-
looking cakes. That cakes were not truly
lepresented, I m sure. The average coun-
try girl can cook well, as a rule, and can
whip up a batch of scones or cakes while a
town maiden murmurs “Fancy.” Possibly
the best cooks were too busy to compete.
There was a really horrible exhibit of
needlework careful, beautiful work wasted
on hideous patterns and worse colors. It
merely illustrated the value of a live Arts
and Crafts Society.
Shop people are agitating for a general
public holiday on Show Day, so that the
man or girl who sells ribbons can have the
same freedom as the bank or office worker,
ihe shop people have only Saturday after-
noon, and reach the showground between two
and three o’clock of the last day, when ex-
hibits and animals are being prepared for a
hurried removal before the five o’clock clos-
ing.
The a^er railway accident, many
ot the Show exhibits added a partly-maimed
assistant to the picture. Men not seriously
enough hurt to warrant losing pay-money
turned up to work with decorations of crossed
plaster strips and bandages, to show where
the aged rolling stock had hit them.
T ,here was no member of the Common-
wealth Parliament at the Show luncheon, on
Thursday. Prime Minister Fisher sent a
letter of apology, which was read out at
toast time. The chairman called upon any
federal member in the gathering to respond
tor the Government. There was no response
from any corner. And no wonder! Last
year. Prime Minister Fisher, whilst speaking
forcibly, was boo-hooed by some highly-
placed but unmannerly squattocrats—a bar-
baric act when one remembers that he was
there as their guest. This year, they would
possibly have emphasised their indignation
by pelting him with chicken bones, if he
had come to remind them that they were
still surviving the ruinous results of Labor
legislation.
Mrs. Edwards and Mrs. Cumming, whose
husbands are persons of the first importance
m the Automobile Club, gave a smart tea-
party on the platform above the lines of
motor-cars. The guests came aloft, sighing
with envy of the cars they passed, and com-
forted themselves with tea and gossip. Mrs
Chester Manifold took her fruit salad and
thought out a new, closed-in car, warranted
to defy the winds of the Western District.
Mrs. Syd. Day, just back from Sydnev.
sported a tricky black and white suit; and
Mrs. Stoddart languished in ermine. Hostess
Mrs. Pvdwards wore lace and orange in a
clouding of mole-colored ninon. Mrs Cum-
ming was in blue and black. Club men
with the long-distance motor look in their
eyes, wandered aloft for tea and talk, and a
bunch of flappers flirted in and out of the
near-by cars.
The Victorian Artists’ Ball happens on
feeptember 20. Some enthusiastic artist-
women are painting a frieze for the balcony
showing early . English people on parad'e.
U is to be a not of costumes from the sth
to the 15th century.
The fine table salts of St. Kilda Yacht
Club came inland last week to the local
lown Hall, and invited the prettiest seaside
maidens to Turkey Trot and Two Step. The
girls stepped and turkeyed with enthusiasm.
-Liie club has not frolicked in this sociable
manner for years; but it has a reputation
for doing things exceedingly well. There
was no sign of vice-royalty. The present
Governors are sadly deficient in water en-
thusiasm. The bounding gee, not the
bounding wave, is their pet weakness.
Last week, the directors of the Melbourne
Steamship Go. invited a# number of people
to come and feed on the Dimboola, the gor-
geous new boat just added to their fleet. The
weather broke down in the fore legs shortly
before the party; but it did not seem to
balk the guests, who sped eagerly through
the wind and rain in cabs and motors, and
clambered up dripping, swaying gangways to
bunting-sheltered decks. David York-Syme
and Captain Roy gripoed the hands of the
brave adventurers on arrival. Mrs. York-
Syme, a sister to our own George Reid,
smiled welcome from the midst of a regal
velvet dress. Wattle blossom and hidden
electric radiators gave a very good imitation
of spring in the enclosure, and a brisk band
kept its spirits up by blowing incessantly
on the. promenade deck. Tea cheered up
the visitors, and exploring parties took obser-
vations of the shining newness of the ship.
Lily Barrett and her pal, Miss Nyulasy,
were lately entertained, unchaperoned and
alone, in the Melbourne Club—the only
ladies. (except the char-peeress) who have
been inside the sacred portals for 20 years.
On Wattle Day, after the two had shivered
valiantly on the mat for an hour, watching
the sheltered members, the secretary invited
them in and entertained them. The im-
promptu invaders bagged a donation from
Governor Fuller, and sundrv tributes in
gold and silver from the Most Expensive, on
their way through the lounge. Their pil-
grimage extended even to the lawns and ivy-
covered walls of the enclosed garden at the
back, whereof the outside world had
almost forgotten the existence. About 20
years ago, the members gave a ball and
erected a marquee in this garden ; but the
weather turned to a flood of rain and nearly
washed the tent away. The experiment was
not repeated, and the calm of the social mon-
astery had not been disturbed by feminine
voices until the Wattle Day girls burst in.
For the moment the privileged pair are the
envy of their sex. They wear the air
which corresponds to that of the plumbers
who have been attending to taps and drain-
pipes at a convent.
What is Art with a capital A? The late
Mr. R. Jenkins (of the Yic. Artists’ So-
ciety) apparently considered that the ulti-
mate aim of Art is to engender an attack of
hay fever. An inspection of his paintings at
Melbourne Athenaeum has enforced this con-
viction. The exhibition is well timed: it
was opened during Show week. The gentle
agriculturist who looked in might easily have
imagined himself back among recently-de-
serted. fields and pastures old. The great
majority of the pictures treat of agricultural
subjects, and Hay is mentioned in the titles
of seven of them. The moderate prices at
which the products of the late Mr. Jenkins
are catalogued give the exhibition some of
the charm of a bargain sale.
The big Poster Ball, in aid of the Girls’
Training Home, rolled successfully last week.
The vice-regals came in full force, and a
Gaud Mayoral party lurked in the offing.
The Maddens and Forrests were also afoot.
The young Grices and Fairbairns and the
young Ryan maiden, who has just “come
out,” helped the show along; but the Staugh-
ton widow could not appear because of the
death of Mr. Armytage. A number of other
people—principally Grices, Armytages and
Staughtons—stayed away for the same rea-
son. Mrs. Cyrus Barlow’s set won a prize
for originality. Her people were dressed
mostly in towels —200 yards of them. (I
refer, of course, to the towels. Any person
who conducted 200 yards of people to a
public dance would be pelted to death with
blanc mange, and buried beneath a cairn of
cream pull’s.)
The original members of the Decimal Club
celebrated joyously on Tuesdav, September
3. A London member of the Club, Mr. Rus-
sell Sheppard, helped in the merrymaking,
which commenced with dinner at the Ori-
ental, continued at “The Quaker Girl,” and
ended hilariously at the Savoy.
Mrs. Robert Harper had songstress Kirkby
Lunn to tea, at Myoora, on Wednesday after-
noon. . Toorak’s Very Best People assembled
to criticise and compliment the melodious
visitor. She displayed perfect amiability
and an enviable sable pelt over ebony crSpe
de Chine. A. power of visiting country
Showites admired her immensely. The
Albert Miller lady sported new draperies, and
Mrs. Hodges trailed in a spring-like silvery
setting. Daughter-in-law Henry Harper
arrived, in grey tones and bright smiles, to
second the efforts of the hostess.
The Peter Mitchells dropped into this dusty
city during Show week, with London and
New York luggage labels all round them. Peter
immediately lost himself in the Show crowds,
leaving Mrs. Peter to unpack and shake out
a brand-new library of foreign clothes, which
had been designed in Paris and built in New
York. She has a particular novelty, to wit,
pleated skirts. {Do I hear the shade of
Grandma remarking: “Tush! Novelty in-
deed! Why I wore them myself!”)
Willie Harper’s motor, dusting homeward
from the Show along the difficult and dirty
Flemington-road, got disastrously involved
with a cyclist, a tram, a fence and a front
door. (It missed a dog, a traction engine, a
parson, a fire brigade, a policeman, the solar
system and a cow, also most of the Cosmos ;
and it just grazed the Past and knocked a
mere splinter off the Future. But it hit every-
thing else real hard.) Whilst trying to avoid a
tram, the motor ran down the unfortunate
cyclist. Then the car became terrified and tried
to escape indoors. It stove in the portal, but
luckily did not injure its crew, and they re-
sumed their homeward way in a taxi.
The cyclist travelled by ambulance to a hos-
pital. And the staring householders won-
dered how the prevailing burglar was to be
foiled until such time as a carpenter repaired
the damage.
Eitel, a member of Dr. Mawson’s Ant-
arctic band, has been in Melbourne energeti-
cally gathering funds. His pretty but rather
sad and anxious-looking wife is with him,
also, a jolly, red-haired, petticoated young-
ster, who sprints all the time after Dad, and
records passing events with a camera.
The widow Chenery’s boy, Augustus, is
to leave mammy for matrimony. The girl
of his choice is Connie McKechnie, daughter
of the Wallaloo squattocrats.
. Dame Best has added twins to the popula-
tion. Knight Robert has been one of the
most energetic battlers for the Baby Bonus,
and now he has lost £lO, because the Baby
Honorarium Bill isn’t yet passed.
J. T. Chia, the dapper official sec. to the
Chinese Consul-General, employs himself
some of these bleak nights in delivering his
lantern-lecture on Old and New China at
suburban halls. Last week the Ilaw-Haw-
thorn branch of the A.N.A. gathered in the
local Town Hall to hear Chia talk of the
native land he escaped from when he was a
youth. Unlike touring foleign devils, who
go only where the population is thickest, the
Consul’s sec. represents China as a countrv
yelling for further development. It has a
“barren North,” like the Commonwealth,
and Chia quotes a Yankee authority,
who argues that the country’s 400 mil-
lion inhabitants could be multiplied by
five, and still find cabbages and breath-
ing room for all. China-night at the
Hawthorn Hall was in the nature of a racial
demonstration. The lecture had a musical
setting, the vocalist being Mrs. Quing Foo
and the pianist Miss Lucy Ming, who sported
the _ A.N.A. gold medal for instrumental
music.
Rumor seems to have definitely decided
that Mr. Chia, of the frock-coat and bell-
topper, will marry Unie Russell, not in
China, but here in our midst. She went to
Europe with her mother on three years’
leave of absence from Dad, but now, after
only six months, they are returning. The
bridegroom-elect proposes to settle here, it
is said. Or to take his blonde Unie to Eng-
land, maybe. He and his brothers , were
educated in England, and, during his subse-
quent sojourn in Pekin, he was director of
the English section of the University. His
culchaw won the maiden’s heart. Moreover,
the family is richly gilded. Chia pere, the
lekin merchant, is understood to be a mil-
lionaire, or even more so, and the young man
who darts. about Collins-street, in immaculate
attire, is in a sure-footed position to support
a wife.
Another local baritone—George Cowley—
is giving a recital, at St. Paul’s Chapter
House HaH, on the 28th. Maggie Stirling
will help the programme, also a basso and a
lady elocutionist. By the wav, a little bird
whispers a doubt as to whether these halls
attached to houses of prayer are duly licen-
sed as places of public entertainment. But
perhaps they don’t need a license. Tickets
are sold at church doors in a quite ordinary
way, and although there is no compulsory
charge for admission to ordained buildings
the collection dish answers the same purpose.
Lalla Miranda, back from Queensland,
stayed in Melbourne for some quiet visiting
amongst her old friends, and a deal of dusty
but informative motoring round the country
bhe gave a dinner party at Menzies’, on
Monday night of last week, and departed on
the Orama, on the 4th. The deck in her
vicinity was fairly heaped with wattle and
violets.
The Glaciarium closed down on Saturday
until next May arrives with a shrill whistle
of draughts. All the energies of the neigh-
boring factory will be devoted, in the interim
to manufacture the stuff that dinks in
glasses, and preserves the ancient fish from
natural decay. The “Glassy” never before
closed so regretfully, and the season ended
with a boom week. On one night, hockey
powdered the ice into a snow field, as thp
Rink and Victorian inter-State skidders sped
«oi'«?i Tuesda y was devoted to sports
calculated to attract country people.. Wednes-
day was made joyous with a fancy dress
carnival, and so on till the end of the week.
A daughter of Marcus Clarke is arriving
here, care of aJ. C. Williamson show. She
has been in Fogland for numerous years,
and if pedigree counts for much in these
matters, she ought to be what daily iournal-
lsm and after-dinner oratory calls an
acquisition to the stage.” It was up to one
M a T ing Yv at least v of Marcus Clarke and
Marion Dunn to be a mummer or mum-
meress.
I \/r^ he i ct ? rs ’ Association matinde, at Her
Majesty s, last Friday, payboxed about £3OO
for the sick fund. The assisting mummers
played usher and doorkeeper parts as well
as stage roles. Grace Palotta, in a plain
o xt people to their seats,
and iNellie Wilson doled out checks and took
the motor wraps of the public. Leslie Hol-
•e a smar t ticket-taker, and Bertie
" ri ? ,’ in a commissionaire’s uniform, made
a whole tenner in tips during his rushes of
business. Some of the Repertory Theatre
gins, having gained experience on Wattle
Alonday, dealt profitably in sweets and pro-
grammes on Friday. One was driving a bar-
a es^e Holland enthusiast for one
ot the actor s photographs, and the buyer
was critically contrasting the picture with
the original, who happened to be standing
close by. \Vho is he talkin" to?” she asked
anxiously. “That’s his wife; she has just
arrived from England, you know.” “Oh!”
sighed the devotee. “Here! Take this back
and give me a Blanche Browne ! 99

. fhe most persistent piece-worker of them all —He
of the Scythe—has been grafting hard of late. On Mon-
day he mowed down “Pat” Auld, one of the McDouall
Stuart explorers. Deceased was born near Man-
chester rn 1840, and came to South Australia two
.lears later, when his father began business in Hind-
iey-street as a grog merchant, and commenced the
planting of the Auldana vineyard. When “Pat” left
school he entered the Surveyor-General’s office under
the late G. W. Goyder, and in 1802 he traversed the
continent under Stuart. With B. TV Finnish he did
further exploring in the Territory, and then turned
ms attention to such trivialities as the wine trade,
tne local Hunt Club and various societies and asso-
ciations. Only four of the McDouall Stuart explorers
now remain, and Mr. Auld's last public appearance
was at the McDouall Stuart jubilee banquet, about a
month ago. _ A week ago the State Government pre-
sented to him, through his son, a gold watch, in re-
ness” ’ services as a hustler in the wilder-
Another old identity was reaped at Gumeracha on
the same day, viz., Dr. J. R. Stephens. He was born
in Cornwall m 27, and came to Australia, from
Canada, in 50. Teaching and doctoring he wan-
dered through various parts of the State, till he
finally settled at Gumeracha, 20 years ago. One of
his daughters is the widow of the late Speaker
Holder.
And on Thursday, Mrs. Barlow, whose husband has

There was a net profit of £lOO from the recent

The Anglican Svnod and the W.C.T.U. Convention
are both sitting here at the time of writing. The
former is to blame for a seething mass of callow and
sombrely-clad curates. They spend much of their '
time consuming ‘clerical lunches” and “Synod teas.”
In the intervals ritualism and compulsory militarv
training are being preached to death.

telhng itself improving li—l mean anecdotes. A way

woman told how she had cured a minister of the
tobacco habit.” He reeked of the weed, and she
reproved him sternly. He was an appalling reeker:
in fact, he reeked so powerfully that she found no iov
in being near him. Six years passed, and she smelt
—4 mean saw—him on a tram. And lo! he was
infinitely more beautiful than hitherto. She edged
closer He still remained beautiful. She was
amazed. Boldly, firmly, she removed her handlcer-

Of Chemists, 1/3, 2/9 and 4/6.
Angier’s Emulsion is both healing and strengthening It
not only soothes and heals the throat and lungs, but it promotes
appetite, aids digestion and builds up strength. For unwards
of twenty years it has been prescribed by the medical profession

POLITICAL
POINTS
A POSSIB LITY OF THE FUTURE.
Mr. D. R. Hall (Minister for Justice) mentioned
that the Discharged Prisoners’ Aid Society had made
several proposals in connection with the matter of
prison reform, and one of these was for a prison
newspaper for the benefit of confinees. — S. M. Herald.
Scene, a prison. Time, any old time ahead.
Business, election of an editor for new lag
meat rag.
Spokesman (to some mute inglorious Chidley):
"Dear brother, in conferring the editorship
of this, our valuable meat-wrapper, upon
you, we have only one request to make, i.e.,
that you keep it like Casar’s wife, beyond
reproach.”
The second week in October is to be Aus-
tralian Manufacturers’ Week. Then a special
effort will be made to fill the shop windows
of Australian cities with Australian goods,
and to convince the person who says We
Can’t Make Things Here, and the individual
who alleges that \ve Can Get Them Cheaper
From Abroad, and the party who declares
that The Time is Not Yet Ripe, that this
country isn’t necessarily born quite dead.
Sydney Labor Council recently had a
spasm of worry over the alleged dear-food
problem, and proposed that the Australian
Government should be asked, among other
things, to suspend the import duty on meat.
Presumably, it had a brilliant idea about
importing beef from London.
When the House of Reps, has nothing
better to do, it potters along at an oft-
adjourned discussion re the proposal to make
Sydney, instead of Yassberra, the Federal
capital. Now, according to the bond, the
capital and at least 100 square miles of
territory must be Federal property. Is it
proposed to hand Sydney over to the Com-
monwealth and start a new State metropolis
at DandalooV
It would seem, from a last week’s police-
court case, that there is a regular trade in
Lascar-smuggling in Sydney. The evidence,
showed that the fee charged for introducing
one of these murky undesirables to N. S. Wales
is £2O. Also, it transpired that the P. and
O. Company alone had lost from 300 to 400
colored seamen and firemen in recent years.
The Customs officers claimed that the two
citizens who played the leading roles in the
court case above mentioned were responsible
for a good proportion of these cases, and
their theory so impressed the magistrate
that he handed them fines of £lOO apeice,
the maximum under the Act. It will do to
go on with, but no punishment that has not
a dash of hard labor in it will really fit this
crime.
THE FACT OF THE MATTER.
Good arguments might be advanced for augment-
ing the outgoing on Defence, the Postal Dept., N.
Territory. Baby Bonus, etc., but can it be done out
of revenue? —D.T. and other Liberals.
The Old Girl (wildly): “Tain't that I
objects t’ yer spendin’ so much; but it's
y’r himpudent an' hindependent hattitood
to'ards a dear ole friend uv th' family's
that hannoys me, so there!"
John Bull’s commissariat lines are
being rapidly, peacefully and auto-
matically cut by the increase of the
world’s population. Replying to the
complaints that Maoriland cheese was
ousting the Canadian product on the
London market, the Kanuck Agricul-
tural Minister stated that, owing to
the rapid increase of home population,
all the- cheese manufactured was re-
quired for home consumption.
N.S.W. still sticks manfully to the
policy of dragging everything to Syd-
ney. Between 1906 and 1912 the num-
ber of electors on the Federal rolls
increased by 262,462 —144,924 in Syd-
ney and suburbs, and only 117,538 in
all the spacious country outside, an
area about half as large again as the
German Empire. It seems hardly
worth while to have a spacious coun-
try when its rulers haven’t spacious
minds to match.
Two items from Sydney Telegraph (Sep-
tember 29) :
Mr. Wade was not present in the Legislative As-
sembly last night, on account of slight indisposition.
During the discussion on the Gas Bill, the member
for Bega (Mr. Wood) came into conflict with the
Speaker, who ordered his removal from the cham-
ber.
Mr. Wade was absent through indisposition ;
Mr. Wood through disposition.
The one cashier at the Customs in Mel-
bourne is an overworked person these Rev-
enue Tariff times. His receipts for the day
are likely to be £30,000 or more, in 600 or
700 different payments, and the checking of
all those accounts is a good day’s work. Evi-
dently something will have to be done in this
little matter of Government business. It Is
a question of higher duties or more cashier.
They are an economical crowd in Victoria.
Some of the railway carriages which per-
ished in the recent accident outside Mel-
bourne were left-offs from the. old Hobson’s
Bay Railway Cos. —things a whole genera-
tion of age, and calculated to crumple up like
a walnut shell eaten by white ants. Appar-
ently Victoria means to run these ancient
vehicles right into the station that is marked
“Judgment Day.”
The wonderful Ordinance by which land in
the Territory was to be let on perpetual
lease with a liability to have the rent raised
almost any day has already burst, and some-
thing new is to be substituted. The original
folly was practically born dead. The most
hopeless feature of it was the proviso that
town lands should not only be re-appraised
every 14 years, but that they should be
liable to re-appraisement at all manner of
intermediate times whenever any public
work raised the value of the soil. To this
there were obvious objections. The estab-
lishment of railway workshops, for instance,
alongside a high-class drapery might en-
hance the value of the land and raise the
rent, yet do great damage to the drapery
business. The arrangement looked too much
like a tenancy at the landlord’s discretion.
The pastoralist might not mind the insta-
bility of things quite so much. If the rent
became impossible, he could drive away a
very large proportion at least of his im-
provements on their own four hoofs. But a
six-storey business blopk is a fixture, and
to put it on top of a bit of land that was
liable to rise up at any moment and hit
the lessee in the eye, so to speak, would be
impossible. In fact, the proposed method of
dealing with N. Territory towns was calcu-
lated to make it dead certain that there
would never be any.
“Trotter” : The monarchs
of England occupy niches in
Canterbury Cathedral. It is
not exactly known when
these effigies began, but only
four niches were left after
William IV. had been
propped up. Queen Victoria
refused to go up,, because, as
anyone may imagine, there
was a legend that the mon-
archy would only last till
the niches were filled. Her
successor did likewise —so
there are the four blank
spaces. The question is
whether their being empty
makes any difference. The
stautes of Brutus and Cas-
sius were more apparent in
the Roman Forum through
being absent.
ONE RACE—ONE LOAN.
[For The Bulletin.]
“We are all one race,” said Mr. Steinberg, with
a smile. 1 —Sydney Evening News item.
Rejoice, ye patriotic scribes —
Australia is becoming known!
United with the Found Two Tribes —
One Race—one IOU—one Loan !
N.s.w. O.C.C.
The Turkish element must have annoyed
all patriotic ice-cream vendors immensely by
the big splash it made recently at Adelaide.
For several years it lias had an “Ottoman
dinner,” but this time it added the unveil-
ing of a picture of the late Federal Minister
Batchelor, who helped a lot of Syrians to
get naturalisation here. Andrew Fisher
went over to perform the ceremony, and
there was a tremendous after-dinner toast-
list, with Governor Bosanquet, Vice-presi-
dent McGregor, Parson Bevan, Butler
(C.P.W.), and Editor Sowden among the
speakers. The appropriate sentiment, “The
Ottoman never will be sat upon!” was unac-
countably omitted.
FARE SCALING IN GENOA.
In an encounter between three men who refused to
pay tram fares at Genoa, and the police and tram
officials, two policemen, one fugitive and the con-
ductor were shot dead.
Perci Da'counti da' Jump saves his fare again.
Apropos of the recent Federal squabble
re day labor, it is just 50 years since Queens-
land gave up that particular system in favor
of contract methods. The latter continued
in vogue until 1902, when financial exigencies
compelled the Philp Government to cut down
expenditure and curtail the profits made by
private contractors. The late John Leahy,
a Private Enterprise apostle to the core, was
the man who re-introduced day-labor into
Bananaland. And it worked well while
John had his eye on it. Yet though John
was a good sort of business man, his eye
wasn’t an unprecedented organ. It was
just a plain ordinary eye.
N.S. W. SPEAKER WILLIS.
South Aus. has gaily authorised another
£2,000,000 worth or so of railways and sun-
dries to be built out of loans. So Cohen,
the weary Titan with the hooked nose, is
expected to shoulder the burden again.
The Argus says of a recent Women’s Na-
tional League meeting that the speakers were
all “of the feminine gander.” A goose con-
vention.
“Lex” writes
Notice has been given by a N.S.W. Labor member
of a Bill to restore E. D. Meagher to his old job as
a solicitor and proctor of the Supreme Court.
Meagher was struck off by the Court (rightly or
wrongly) just as many other Gentlemen One have
been. If he alone is restored by Act of Parliament,
while the cases of other men are not even inquired
into, it can only be because he is a Labor member
and his party is in power. There is surely a weak
point in the logic somewhere!
S.A. Works Minister Butler has declared
in a casual wav that under the present Gov-
ernment navvies do 20 per cent, more work
than they did when Verran was Premier,
and the Verran party foams considerably and
demands evidence, which isn’t forthcoming.
Still, there are possibilities in the case.
Verran’s ganger was driving a Government
supporter,, who could always withdraw his
support if requested to shovel an excess of
dirt in a given time, The present Govern-
ment is mostly driving an Opposition sup-
porter, and having no hope of getting his
vote it doesn’t care how much dirt he
shovels, provided he doesn’t shovel too little
dirt.
The absurdity of Party Government looks
as if it were at last beginning to be recog-
nised. In N.S-W. it was necessary to invent
Speaker Willis to save the situation. In
Tasmania one man holds absolutely the bal-
ance of power. In Maoriland things are so
divided that any hour may bring forth one
of those political crises which, when they
arise, make a big hole in the public pocket.
The most economical sort of general election
costs the general public in hard cash more
than on an average it pays for a Sunday din-
ner, while the temporary dislocation of bus-
iness must indirectly add enormously to the
bill. Yet, while Party Government remains
there is always a general election in sight,
and J. Smith may at any time, and to serve
no earthly good purpose, be asked to plump
down his hard earned cash to run a show
which at best isn’t equal to the poorest
sort of flickergram. And the cash cost of
frequent and useless elections isn’t the worst
feature of Party Government. The facts of
the case were brought out strongly by
N.S.W. Minister Beeby, in his recent speech
at Nyngan, when he declared that —“So
acute has become the division in party poli-
tics to-day that in cases where a non-party
vote would record 90 per cent, in favor of a
certain thing, because there happens to be
a party system, one party, while believing in
the thing the other party is advocating, re-
gards it as an accepted duty nevertheless to
prevent it being done, for the simple reason
that the other party has brought it forward.”
If the Holman-McGowen crowd was cap-
able of rising to the height of its plain public
duty, the fact that one of its number has dis-
covered the comic-opera nature of the game
now being played ought to offer good pro-
mise of reform. Labor parties used to talk
about Elective Executives and a Referendum
with Initiative while they were in opposi-
tion, but their memories have a way of fail-
ing when once they reach office.
THE CYCLONE.
[FO RTHE BULLETIN.]
Mr, R. O. Blackwood, president of the Vic. Em-
ployers’ Federation, in his address at the annual
meeting, went so far as to say that we are nearing
the edge of an industrial cyclone, which must bring
about general devastation. One particular section
Of the body politic seems determined to destroy the
others. If he were in a position to advise the
workers, he would urge that they should not make
the conditions so hard that Brains and Capital will
be forced to go elsewhere. —News item.
The cyclone that is coming,
Saith the Profit fat and hearty,
Will bescatter the illusions
Of the Socialistic Party.
When he talketli in a high tone
Of the vague, uncertain cyclone
Our eyeballs bulge with horror and our flesh begins
to. creep ;
When he thumps the Tory tabor
And predicts the doom of Labor
We can feel ourselves already lying prostrate in a
heap.
Brains and Capital will leave us,
Stewing slowly in our graA'y;
All our industries will perish,
And our means to build a Navy
Will be swept away and sky blown
By the fury of the cyclone
Which is coming to this country as a judgment from
the Lord ;
Yet it might have been prevented,
If the workers had consented
To be governed by the wisdom of a gentle Wages
Board.
No tongue can tell exactly
Just the date of that to-morrow
When the hungry working classes,
Crushed by unavailing sorrow,
Will be talking in a dry tone
Of the devastating cyclone
That swept the fields of Labor and brought Unions
all to smash ;
But the dismal time is coming
When the Industries now humming
Will be finally abandoned by their parents, Brains
and Cash.
Then, like orphans on a doorstep,
They will stare at one another —
Yea, like little ones bereaved
Of their father and their mother;
And the hopes so vain and high-flown,
Of the days before the cyclone,
Will haunt them whilst they babble bitter curses on
the names
Of the fatal, old-time leaders,
Pertinacious mischief breeders,
Who wrought ruin to the workers by their Socialistic
Aims.
VICTORIA,
O. K.

HEARTBURN.
DR. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT PILLS
FOUND MOST EFFECTIVE FOR
THIS DISTRESSING COMPLAINT.
Heartburn is a symptdm of indigestion,
and consists of a most distressing and gnaw-
ing pain in the stomach, often with sour,
acid belchings, nausea and fainting. When
the food is only partially digested, it gives
Mr. E. B. Garland.
From a photo.
rise to an accumulation
of wind or gas gene-
rated from the excess
of acidity from the im-
perfectly-digested food.
To overcome this com-
plaint, plain food should
be taken sparingly, and
a course of Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills,
which will strengthen
the digestive organs and
remove all acidity from
the stomach. These
pills do not merely allevi-
ate the trouble, but vet
at the cause, and thus
permanently overcome the trouble.
Mr. E. B. Garland, “Henbury,” Ruthven
Street, Waverley, Sydney, states: “For some
considerable time I have suffered greatly
from heartburn, indigestion and liver and
kidney troubles, and at times the pain would
be very great. I was recommended by a
friend to try Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills.
I started on a course, and found on con-
tinuing that they gave me great relief, and
although I have had a return of the symp-
toms, a dose of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills never fails to put me right, and restore
me to health again. We always keep a
bottle handy in case of need. I have pleasure
in sending you this testimony, which you
may use as you think proper. I have recom-
mended Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills to
many friends, who now always use them.”

SPORTING
NOITIONS
At time of writing, the life of Australia’s
clever and daring aviator, Hart, of Parramatta, is
hanging by a thread. He was making one ot a
series of trial flights with anew type of mono-
plane designed and built by Mr. D. K. Sandiord
and himself. It flew' beautifully, and they were
both delighted with the model, which promised a
speed of over 70 miles an hour with ease. The
engine was not new, it was the same well-proved
and trusty Gnome that he had used on all his other
aerial craft. On Wednesday evening last week he
was returning from a successful flight, and was
about 200 ft. from the ground when the engine seemed
to stop. The machine gave a dangerous dip, and
Hart apparently tried to use the planes, but failed.
Then tiie aeroplane plunged madly, head foremost
for the ground. It was thought at first that he must
be dead, for the front of the aeroplane w'as buried
in the earth with the force of that terrific dive. But,
fortunately, he was not. Both legs were broken, his
skull was fractured, and he was covered with cuts
and w'ounds. Considering the ghastly nature of his
injuries, it is a marvel that he is alive, but he
made excellent progress, and though his condition
is most serious, there are strong hopes that he will
pull through. Yet if he does recover, he will
almost assuredly be lame, and in all probability his
flying days are over. A man whose skull has been
fractured must confine his aviation to the theoretical
and terrestrial sides of the business.
If anybody has experienced any difficulty
in finding Mclntosh of late it is not owing to rush
to the head over his latest and greatest plunge. The
solemn truth is that he is hiding, with most of the
Australian and foreign teams for the great tug-of-
war. The trouble is that the rest of the teams have
objected to the Parramatta Pygmies, and the sport-
ing firmament is full of angry Heckenberg. Nine
international teams went on strike when they heard
the Pygmies were going to put the family into the
tussle. They held a solemn meeting, and sent a
most emphatic and strongly worded “NO,” but never
a word of “Why Not.” When this was made public
50ft. of Heckenberg leaned over Sydney and hollered:
“Whaffor?” And then old Parramatta awoke from
the dead, and with an alderman and an ex-Mayor
striding magnificently in the van, swooped down on
Mclntosh, with the Parramatta Pygmies in the rear ;
and all day long the noise of battle roared amongst
the joists of the Stadium’s new roof and fled city-
wards on the wintry wind. So Mclntosh and his
minions fled and hid themselves; and nothing but a
ruling from Willis, the Mighty One, the Dread, will
bring them back from the vasty deep.
“Bloggs” : It would be interesting to know
the point of view of referee Scott, of the Stadium,
as regards fouls. Does he consider them meritorious
actions? Or does he think that a little fouling now
and then is good for the boxing game? Or does he
consider that every pug should be allowed his first
foul —not to mention ms second and third —in every
contest that jie wages ? All these hypotheses are
arguable on the form displayed _b.y Scott in the last
three fights witnessed by this writer, at the Stadium.
In the jxeileher-O’Donnell scrap the Yank found him-
self losing. He accordingly, with the utmost delib-
eration, smote O’Donnell below the belt, the U.S.
theory being that it is more honorable, as well as
less painful, to lose on a foul than a knock-out.
O’Donnell yelled with anguish; the referee cau-
tioned the offender; the mill proceeded. In the
next round Kelleher fouled his adversary twice more,
and with obtrusive frankness at that. On his smiting
below the belt a fourth time, Scott did what he
ought, by the rules, to have done a round earlier,
and wiped Kelleher out. In the McCoy-Til fight, one
may fairly say that Til’s chances of winning were
rendered hopeless by nothing more nor less than his
opponent’s foul tactics. His eye was laid open by
McCoy’s head at an early stage, and he was roughed
illegally right through the disturbance. Jack Read
is ordinarily a fair fighter. Encouraged, possibly,
by the license allowed in the foregoing contests (a
license, by the way, that Snowy Baker would never
have tolerated), he mishandled Hock Iveys, last
Saturday night,- in an outrageous fashion. After
Keys had been hit low three times, the following
occurred (vide S. M. Herald, 9/9/’l2) :
“Read’s corner sent him in to make up leeway.
He started roughing, and in the breakaway struck
Keys low in the groin. The veteran bent beneath
the blow, and then, straightening himself up, with an
effort he went after Read. Keys never seemed to get
his full strength back again, and weakened gradually
as the round progressed.”
Yet, at the end of a match in which, by the ad-
mission of a vast majority of the local sporting
writers, and practically the whole of the Stadium
audience, Keys outpointed Read in all but three or
four rounds, referee Scott indicated the latter as
winner. The question arises: Do fouls count for
points to the fouler in Scott’s opinion? To the
writer it seems that the opposite should be the rule.
If I couldn’t bring myself to do the right thing, and
starkly disqualify a boxer the moment he earned
such punishment, under the laws of boxing, I would,
at least, register against him as manv points for
each illegal action, as though his adversary had
scored a knock-down. The present laxity which re-
sults in a fair, chivalrous boxer, like Keys, losing
to one who has fought him foully is going, if it is
persisted in, to afflict Australia with the manners and
customs of the U.S. prize ring. And once that hap-
pens, the Wowser will pass local boxing the slumber-
stroke amid general applause.
* * * *
Referee Arthur Scott made a mess of
things again at Sydney Stadium when he gave Read
the verdict over the elusive and polished Ilock Keys.
For fully 14 rounds Keys won handsomely; but as
everybody knows, Keys is far from robust and lacks
stamina. Towards the end he tired visibly, and the
stronger Read did get some of his own back. But
the old master of Australian boxers made him look a
perfect novice, hitting him when, where and just how
he darned well pleased. Read, aware that as a boxer
he had no chance, tried roughing tactics, and well
earned the warnings he got. The wonder is he
didn't get more than warnings. Of course, had it
been a fight to a finish Read would have eventually
won through sheer attrition of the enemy; but it was
not a fight to a finish. It was a scrap of 20 rounds,
for 14 of which Keys absolutely outpointed his
younger and stronger rival, only to find that in the
opinion of the referee the six last rounds in which
he did not have altogether the best of it made the other
14 kick the beam. The referee’s billet is a putrid
position to hold. It’s hard to watch for breaches of
the rules and keep a tally of the points he mentally
awards each bruiser, and have the account all made
up ready to deliver to the fighters and the public
immediately the last gong goes. It is no wonder
referees do make mistakes, but rather that they don’t
make more. But. there seems to be a general con-
census among fight fans and scribes that Mr. Scott
made an out-size bloomer on this occasion.
The brief, brilliant, sudden-death rush in
and around Sydney for the Rugby League’s City Cup
has already reached the final stage, and the decisive
battle will be played off next Saturday, between the
two unbeaten teams, Glebe and South Sydney, at the
Agricultural Ground. The two teams qualified for
the final when South Sydney overwhelmed North
Sydney by 16 points to 11, and Glebe downed Bal-
main by 11 points to three. Curiously enough, the
Glebe-Balmain match was regarded as such a fore-
gone conclusion that it drew only about 6000 people,
while over 10,000 rolled in to the Sports Ground to
see South and North Sydney decide which should go
overboard in a game which popular fancy regarded
as anybody’s. Asa matter of fact, North Sydney
put up a better losing game than Balmain, or ooutn
Sydney put up a worse winning one than Glebe —
whichever way the 'ball follower likes to take it. The
Glebe-Balmain struggle started with a see saw action
out of which Glebe generally came off best, and, at
any rate, always succeeded in preventing its enemy
scoring. So the first half ended in favor of Glebe
with five points, while Balmain had not scored. After
the resumption Glebe put on three more and led by
eight to nil. Things looked hopeless, and then more
hopeless still, when Glebe soared to 11 without Bal-
main breaking its egg. It was not till the shadows
were lengthening that Balmain made its first real
effort, and went howling through the ranks of Glebe
as though they were men of straw, and scored a try.
The kick for goal was a failure. Going again, Bal-
main secured and let loose another passing charge
that seemed to have the Glebe defence flabbergasted—•
and then the whistle went, and Balmain was out of
the City Cup by 11 points to three. South Sydney
accomplished what Balmain failed to and hauled
the game out of the fire at the tail end of things.
South started well, and rolled over the Northmen
till its score stood eight points to North’s two.
Then North, which, with the wind in its favor, had
failed to do anything to write home about, came up,
like a giant full of tonic, to face a gale that blew
right down its neck. Before long North was leading
with nine points to eight, and the flabbergasted
South began to wilt visibly. Hereabouts the cheery,
not to say tremendous, remarks of the captain had
the same effect on the team as cuss words on bul-
locks, and the Southern men gave a great heave, and
tried to drag the bogged game out of the mire.
Some of these football captains have a fine flow of
rhetoric. But North continued to progress, and lifted
the score to 11, with South still stuck at eight.
Here the South’s captain made an extra effort, and
tore the heavens like a garment with his shrieks of
encouragement. The South team gave an extra heave
and the dray began to move. Presently South was
leading with 13 to 11. Another desperate charge
through the shadows, just as the hand trembled on
to the hour, a try secured, and a hurried shot at
goal which missed; and South had won with 16
points to 11.

The final of the Rugby Union competi-
tion between Western Suburbs and the runner-up,
Glebe, saw the Western crowd lose its collective
head. It had Glebe beaten again and again, but
over-eagerness caused it to kick too hard and with
bad aim. It charged wild ; it lost its judgment and
mulled its defence by clawing frantically when it
should have, been polished and serene and looked
carefully before it passed. Still, for quite a long
while, the ferocious hunger of its front division for
the leather fairly smothered the Glebe back machine,
and reduced it to impotence and gibber. Glebe,
having won the toss, took advantage of the wind
that was raging; but all the same did not make
much apparent headway. It was a whipped team if
the Western crowd could only recover its thinking
apparatus. West couldn’t, so it half-time Fate
wrote the score Glebe three to nil. It was a magni-
ficent piece of work scoring that try. A charge, a
punt, a recovery, and then a two-man pass. When
Western Suburbs got the wind behind them the hearts
of the Glebe barrackers sank. But Glebe played better
than ever, and made some fine dribbling rushes. West-
ern Suburbs saved the situation several times by forc-
ing, and then Glebe secured another try, and stood six
to nil. It was close on time when a lucky accident
gave West a try, which was converted. This put
fresh hope into the Western heart, and valiant
attempts were made at field goals, any one of which
would have saved the situation; but they failed.
The whistle blew on Glebe as the premier team for
1912 by six to five.

The wild struggle of the Soccer ’haliers
for the Gardiner Cup is drawing to its close. Only Bal-
main A and Sydney A remain in, and by Saturday
night one of them will be dead. These two knocked out
Cessnock and Garden Island respectively on Saturday
last, and cleared the field for their Armageddon,
from which the conqueror will emerge champion of
the State. After that there will remain only the
Association and Rawson Cups to be decided. Owing
to the Gardiner Cup semi-finals there were no matches
in the other two Soccer competitions on Saturday.
Balmain’s stamping of Cessnock was severe and de-
cisive, but not brutal, although the actual play was
considerably marred by rough work, which resulted
in one man, Marshall, of Cessnock, being carried off
with a broken leg, and two men being pitched off
for mistaking the game. They took it to be Red Indian
instead of Soccer. Cessnock had all the worst of the
opening, playing in the teeth of a stiff breeze. But
it made no difference when ends were changed, and
Balmain won by four goals to nil. The tussle be-
tween Sydney and Garden Island was a nearer thing,
for although the Island could not score, it managed
to prevent Sydney getting home more than twice.
Although not so wild and woolly as the Balmain-
Cessnock riot, it was as willing as.anyone could wish;
and was played with a disregard for the conventions
that would have made even Chidley blush about the
leCT V *
The Sydney Messengers, it seems, are not
the only goal kickers in Australia. Dr. A. C. Wilton,
of Adelaide University Club, holds the S.A. record
this season, with 49 kicked to his own cheek. A
very creditable performance.

A beantifnl crowd, tallied at 40.133, of
whom 24,451 “parted” £1540 3s. 6d., witnessed
the downfall of Geelong and the recrudescence of
Carlton on Saturday, in the Vic. League’s first semi-
final, on the Metropolitan Cricket Ground, Melbourne.
The episode promised a joyful and exciting con-
clusion, but in the second quarter driving showers
of rain and hail swept away all hones of first-class
play. The first quarter ended evenly enough—Carl-
ton 21 to Geelong’s 16 points—and in the second
term the Geelongites put in a sustained attack that
should have won the game outright; but erratic
kicking, somewhat excused by the disconcerting rain,
gave them only nine behinds, in as many minutes,
when they should have had at least six more goals.
That was, in effect, the Seasiders’ last effort, for
Carlton perceived that it had miraculously escaped
a great disaster, and thereafter bogged in with suffi-
cient vigor to notch point for point, while in the
last term the Old Blues put on goal after goal with
such apparent ease and precision that the final score
—Carlton 71, Geelong 43 points—by no means dis-
closes the relative strength of the teams. Briefly,
Geelong failed because it had no system and
because it couldn’t kick, the lofty punts of
its “backs” being pleasing to inspect, but
of as little use to the side as the erratic shots of its
forwards. Carlton, on the other hand, has but little
more organisation than Geelong, and its ’bailers lack
vim, but its forwards know how, to make the best
use of their chances, and its backs understood the
art of clearing their goal effectively.
On the North Melbourne ground. North
and ’Wick, re-playing their indecisive semi-final of
two weeks before, perpetrated a feat unique in noot-
ball records, as far as this writer knows, and which
sent the barrackers wild with delirium Wicks
team was exactly the one that “drew on the tormei
occasion ; North made two changes. I* rom the start
North took the lead, and by half-time had an ad-
vantage of 14 points; but after the interval Wick
set to in earnest, and steadily accumulated goals
and behinds, till, at lemon time, it had five goals 11
behinds to North’s five goals nine behinds. it
wasn’t enough to swear by, and when, on resuming,
North gained a goal, ’Wick had to bog into the
battle afresh. It got a goal and a behind, then, with
a three-point lead, set down to stalling off North s
attacks. But North couldn’t be successfully stalled ;
it broke through three times, and though it couldn t
commandeer the earnestly-desired goal, it got the
necessary three points to draw once more —and then
the bell rang. Scores: Six goals 12 behinds all, as
compared with six goals nine behinds at the first
draw. There are rumors of a protest, one of ’Wick s
behinds being claimed as a goal; but the Ass. will
probably ignore the matter and order the boggers to
rush to battle once more. There are still two Satur-
days to spare before the cricketers seize the ground,
and as last week's 20,000 crowd paid out £268, the
Ass. will view the third trial of strength with a
friendly eye.
* * * *
The N.S.W. Rugby League will, after all
the skite about it, have to face only a deficit of
£lB5 6s. Bd. (wonder what that lawyer charged the
6s. Bd. for) to make up on the cost of the wander-
ing Kangaroos least year. Of the expenditure of
£6597, fares (12300) and “allowances’’ to players
( £2108) swallowed the bulk of the boodle. The
League has immense moral satisfaction, though, _in
the thought that the deficiency was caused by paying
the team a decent allowance. And verily, I say unto
you, that the howl of a footballer’s wife in the
night, complaining of insufficient allowance, is
mightier than a bad season to bust a league’s mana
with the public. The League has played the better
part, for of a truth £lB5 6s. Bd. is a bagatelle, and
not much of that.

The Victorian Cricket Association scored
heavily last Saturday when, without warning, its
emissaries appeared at the Melbourne Cricket Ground
when the football semi-final was in full blast, and
distributed 25,000 copies of a pamphlet entitled “The
1912 Australian Eleven in England. A Few Facts
for Fair Minded Sportsmen.” The other side soon
got wind of the nature of the publication which was
being distributed, and frantic efforts were made to
stop it, some remarkable persons appealing to the
police and park rangers to heave the distributors
out. The pamphlet is brief and to the point. It
shows, for instance, that of the nine matches played
before the deluge set in the Australian XI. won
six, lost one and drew two. Which compares with
the doings of preceding Xl.’s as follows: —
Year. Won. Lost. Drawn.
1912 ..6 1 2
1909 2 3 4
1905 5 1 3
1902 .. 4 1 4
Comment would be superfluous.
The results of the Test matches in England in 1012
are as follows:
Batting Bowling
Won. Lost. Drawn. Average. Average.
England ..4 0 2 25.19 14.26
Australia .. 2 1 3 27.66 23.65
S’Africa ..0 5 1 17.21 30r17
And yet that marvellous organ of public opinion, the
Age, said : “The batting averages make poor ‘reading’
(they were only the highest of the lot), and the
bowiers have proved very uneven.” (Their average
was better than Africa’s.) Some of the individual
performances are shown to beat the band. Bardsley
is the first Australian to score 2000 runs on two
occasions in England. Macartney scored his 1000
runs in record time. Matthews is the only bowler
in the world who has achieved the “hat trick” twice
in one test match. And Bardsley’s batting average
is the highest ever secured by an Australian willow
wielder. It is sad to see a paper like the Age de-
scend to hawking stale fish and trying to push trade
by misrepresentation.
* * * *
G. R. Hazlitt, one of the best bowlers and
most startling fieldsman in the Australian XI., will
on his return from England remove to Adelaide,
where he will be a master at St. Peter’s College.
He turned 30 the other day, but is only seven years
old at cricket. He was picked as a bowler
against Jones’s team in 1907. He failed with the
ball, but otherwise covered himself with glory in
his first Test, when he dislocated his thumb in a
marvellous one-hand catch in the slips. When Aus-
tralia wanted over 70 to win Hazlitt, with a not-
out innings of 30, did a lot towards it. When he
left he was a master at King’s School, Parramatta,
and a mighty tower of strength to Central Cumber-
land. He will not be available for the South Aus-
tralian XI .till after a few months residence, but as
it is the law it must be obeyed. A son of veteran
actor Hazlitt, he is naturally a rover.
* * * *
Till Saturday last, the Kent fixture
wound up the list of matches that really
matter, but play (the same old deluge) was
impossible till Saturday, when, strangely, Greg-
ory lost the toss. The County declared with
six down for 170, of which the Test all-rounder
Woolley amassed 82 by furious driving which out-
jehued Jehu. Hazlitt grabbed four for 42. Aus-
tralia’s effort realised 177, and the srame ended in
the usual draw before a miserable 1000 spectators.
The last three items on the programme, Combined
Surrey and Middlesex, Lord Londesborough’s Eleven
and the South of England, are all mere fake and
padding, and of no real consequence. They merely
prolong the agony till September 11, but have no
more claim to inclusion in the real merit averages
than the Universities, Scotland, Durham (a second-
class countv), and “An” England Eleven. Concern-
ing Australian averages, England was the only real
Test. S’Africa was a softer snap than many a countv.
And when the informative acid is applied with
respect to the English matches alone, the leading
Australians take this order:—
BATTING.
Not Highest Aver-
Innings. Out. Score. Runs. age.
Macartney .. 3
ICeHeway 4 1 61 107 35.66
Bardsley 3
BOWLING.
Aver-
Overs. Maidens. Runs. Wickets, age.
Minnett .. 10.1 3 34 4 8.50
Hazlitt .. 113.3 36 218 12 18.16
Whitty . . 110 42 252 12 21.00
Minnett played only in the final match, and bowled
only in the first innings. Hazlitt bore the brunt of
the attack in all three matches, and the Greasy
Leather medal goes to him, while Macartney dons
the dripping willow wreath. As Minnett was laid
up earlier in the tour with strained thigh muscles,
he shall have a soft cushion. In the general averages
for matches of any importance (against England,
S’Africa, first-class counties and the M.C.C.), Macart-
ney tops the batting with 34 innings, one n.o. ; highest
score 208. total 1748; average 52.96. Bardsley has
38 innings, five n.o. ; h.s. 184 (n. 0.), total 1586,
average 48.06. None of the others averaged 40,
though all did well some time or other. Macartney
also heads the bowling in these 26 merit matches.
Trundling in 16 of them he captured 25 wickets for
442, average 17.68. Maclaren was tried in only
seven, but he grabbed 19 wickets for 344, average
18.10. Then come the two who did all the hardest
graft of the tour—Hazlitt, with 20 matches, 70
wickets, for 1328 runs, average 18.97 ; and Whitty,
with 21 matches, 69 wickets, for 1417 runs, average
20.53. Minnett, in 16 matches, took 30 wickets for
619, average 20.63.
At Caulfield last Saturday, a few of the
unready cracks of the Cup betting market had an
outing in the Memsie Stakes (nine furlongs), a w.f.a.
event which is worth £4OO to the winner. The
Parisian, Bobadea and Broadsword went out un-
backed, and ran accordingly, which suggests that
there is no fear of either of them being overwound-
up for their big engagements. Wolawa and the im-
ported Eudorus appeared to be genuinely fancied, and
may have disappointed their trainers The Derby
colt, though backed down to two to one, was beaten
by Captain White and Rathlea, finishing not many
inches ahead of Eudorus. The winner’s brilliant
performance gives him a chance for Caulfield Cup,
presuming that he can stay the distance; and, in
any case, the Captain should be a reliable trial
horse for his stalwart stable companion, Uncle Sam.
Sydney lacrosse semi-finals for premier-
ship honors were apples of Sodom for Eastern
Suburbs, which, through the season, had only once
smelt defeat in 16 matches. The chance of Sydney
Club against the Suburbs was snuffe'd out—even as
the King-street girl snuffs out the attentions of the
horny-handed wharf-laborer. All of which goaded
Sydney to frenzy. So the men who are fined if they
throw a tram-ticket or a bumper on the pave tucked
their ears into their sweaters and bogged in mightily,
and tore the greatness from Eastern Suburbs by
seven goals to five. In the other section of the
semi-final realm, Petersham romped over Balmain by
10 goals to four. So Sydney and Petersham will
take charge of the earth next Saturday for the glory
of the onion-net pastime.
Leichhardt and University clashed in the
final for Sydney Baseball premiership. The students
were alleged to have forsaken all other studies for
the week in favor of glorified rounders. But evi-
dently baseball is more than a theory, and the worthy
burghers of Leichhardt arose and chewed up the
budding lawyers and immature surgeons by 13 runs
to six in a nine-innings game. It was a very convinc-
ing judgment—the sort from which there is no
appeal.

The race follower who likes to take
his and her pleasure amidst garden-lilce sur-
roundings is reminded that the Victoria Park Racing
Club’s meeting will transpire on Wednesday (18th).
The course is in perfect order, and, as everybody
knows, Victoria Park is the garden of N.S.W. ; a
green, flower-strewn paradise amidst the drifting
sand of the desert of Zetland. It is always beautiful,
but now in its spring verdure of young grass and
fresh flowers, it is superb. Owners and trainers are
informed that entries close on the stroke of five this
afternoon (Thursday), and the weights will be.
declared at 6 p.m. on Saturday, which will give the
scientific punter plentv of time to practise the baked
roll method of divination. The programme holds
seven races and the added money is £500.*

The 18 cyclists who faced the howling
breeze with icebergs on its bosom (one couldn’t
honestly call it a zephyr), and the roadway of float-
ing dust in the N.S.W. Cyclists’ Union individual
road championship at Homebush, Sydney, on Satur-
day, earned a leg-in for the next set of
V.C. medals which may be imported. At the end
of 19 miles the strong head wind had caused nine
weary ones to fall by the roadside. At 30 miles only-
three strong whirlers in their agony were sticking to
the game and showing their teeth against the wind.
The final rush was a struggle between C. Hooper
and S. Edworthy (last year’s winner). Hooper won
with a few lengths to spare. D. Kirk, the only other
plugger to weather the gale, filled third place about
100yds. to rearward.
Time has moved quickly in the motor
manufacturing trade. An interesting antique exhibit
at the Melbourne motor show last week was a trio
of buggy-cars and a petrolised tricycle, dating back
to 1900, or thereabouts. The Vacuum Oil Cos. had
collected these curios. Dr. Syme, of Lilydale, brought
out the tricycle. Thomson, of'Armadale (Vic.),
built one of the four-wheelers, and drove it from
Sydney to Melbourne a dozen years ago, and Dr.
Syme again was the exploiter of a four-cylinder
Mors car in 1900.

I’d start at once to equip myself with a knowledge
which would serve me throughout life.
Knowing how to defend yourself is no load to
carry, but it makes up for no end of lack of weight
in a personal encounter.
Supposing you got into a “rough up” (and there’s
no knowing when you will), think how handy it
would be to you—what increased confidence it
instil—how you could keep your opponent
off. Think of the satisfaction of “peppering” him
at will.
Well, then, this very handy knowledge can be ob-
tained quickly and easily by my system of teaching
and can be learnt at your own home.

“Messenger”: The other day I listened
furiously while the deputation from the
Council of Churches protested to Prime Min-
ister Fisher against the so-called “bonus for
babies” being granted to mothers of illegiti-
mate infants, on the ground that it would
“encourage immorality.” Are these church-
men really so simple as to suppose that any
woman will undergo the pain and danger of
maternity for the sake of a fiver? And do
they really imagine that girls will yield
more readily and frequently through the
knowledge that, if the infant arrives, they
will collect one hundred shillings wherewith
to bid the “respectable” world defiance? I
guess that half the Church feeds regularly
on thistles, and that the curate with the
cold in his head was quite right when he
cried out “Let us bray.”
“Chasuble”: The Sydney Church of Eng-
land Synod, in common with all the others
of Australia, has again been dinging it in
about the shortage of clerics. Here is the sim-
ple remedy. Announce that the Archbishoprics
of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide
and all the fat bishoprics and church livings,
will be strictly reserved for Australians.
Then the clergy won’t care if they start on
poor wages, for there will be possibilities
ahead. Young men will come forward,
as do the barristers and medicoes. What a
roar there would be if the Chief Jus-
tices, or any kind of Justices, in Australia
were fetched from England! And if the
office boy understood that he would never
be more than an office boy, what inducement
would he have to lick the stamps with en-
thusiasm and conscientiousness?

A. KEEN, Master.
PEACOCK and GODDARD, 3 South Square,
Gray’s Inn, London, W.C., for Rickerby and
Son, Cheltenham.
NOTE.—The above-named intestate, Ann Haines,
died a spinster on the 22nd March, 1909.
The said Jane Splain was the daughter of James
Haines and Mary (Cove), his wife, of Cirencester,
Gloucester, and is believed to have married —•
Splain, a schoolmaster, of Minety, Wilts, and to
have gone to Ireland, and is believed to be dead.
The said William Haines was the son of James
Haines and Ann (Guest), his wife, of Cirencester,
Gloucester, and went to the United States of America
in 1851, and was in Ohio in the years 1861 or 1862,
since when he has not been heard of.
The said Ann Haines (formerly Guest) was mar-
ried to James Haines at Circencester, Gloucester, in
the year 1825.
The said William Roberts was a son of William
Roberts and Ann (Haines), his wife, and was born
at Charlton Kings, Cheltenham, in the county of
Gloucester. He went to New South Wales about 40
years ago. sinee when he has not been heard of.
“Prop-tick’’: It was smart work to get “Ben Hur”
on the Melbourne stage the first night (Saturday).
The whole box of dice only arrived from Invercar-
gill at two o'clock the same afternoon. A dozen
horses aboard, to be rehearsed, hundreds of tons of
scenery and props. The Williamson management
had arranged with the Union Steamship Co. to push
the s.s. Maunganui. Ten hours were saved on the
trip, despite adverse weather, but it took 150 extra
tons of coal. Work from the wharf was done with
clockwork rapidity. Same on Royal stage. AH
ready at 6.45, just an hour before up-curtain.
“Ami’’: G. R. Ireland, recently alluded to, was
the favorite amateur Melbourne star, in parts like
Claude Melnotte, with the Garrick Club. Becoming
a professional, he was succeeeded by Batten, a credit-
able Hamlet, while the popular low comedian was
Bagster. Afterwards the Histrionic Club sprang up,
with such as Levey, Bruce, Philp and Fox. Ireland’s
first professional show was as Sir Eglamour, in “Two
Gentlemen of Verona,” at the Royal, under Brooke’s
management. The cast included Brooke, Heir, Laip-
bert, a comedian named Wigan, Ellen Mortyne and
Sirs. Heir. Miss Mortyn had first appeared in “The
Unequal Match,” and then in a piece called “The
Daughter of the Stars.” Ireland at once established
a good position. He was in the glorious company
engaged by Simmonds for Jefferson, including Heir.
Lambert, Holt, Stewart, Fitzgerald, Dunn, Mrs.
Heir, Rosa Dunn and Mrs. Phillips. What fine pro-
ductions were “Our American Cousin,” “The Octo-
roon” and “Cricket on the Hearth.” Better still
for Ireland was his association with Barry Sullivan,
at the Royal, for about two years. Ireland had the
misfortune of not being so supple as men like Tither-
adge, Cathcart and Harwood.
The matinge performance at Her Majesty’s (Melb.),
engineered by the new Association of Ac-tors on be-
half of their unborn benefit and pension funds, was
not verj' attractive in the programme, but it got a
lovely advt. through being boycotted by the com-
bined theatrical trades unions. Melbourne Argus
gave the boycott a full column report, the burden
whereof was commendation of the free, noble and in-
dependent anti-unionists who had come to the rescue
of the Cause, and would “assure a splendid
success for the matinee.” The announcement that
Grace Palotta, Andrew Higginson, Bantock and co.,
would act as ushers, ticket-sellers, gallery packers,
etc., was almost pathetic in its tacit suggestion that
such “larky” mummery on a matinee occasion
amounted to a checkmating of the Theatrical In-
dustries Association. The combined forces include
the Theatrical Employees Association, the Musicians’
Union (to which all the principal theatre orchestras
belong), the Supernumeraries Union, the Billposters’
Union, and two organisations of stage performers.
Already it is in the power of the T.I.A. to smash
the Association of Ac-tors by threatening to boycott
the managements which employ them. This first
move was directed merely against the honorary man-
agement of the A.A.’s first benefit performance. It
was not expected to prevent the matinSe show from
happening, but it was bound to prove to the Com-
bine the futility of offering direct opposition to the
interests and principles of trades unionism. In pro-
moting the anti-trades union Association of Ac-tors,
theatrical managers were looking for trouble. If
they persist, they will surely find what they are
looking for.
“Wonga”: “Get-Rich-Quick Wallingford” affords a
good example of the sacrifice of verisimilitude to
the exigencies of the stage—with special reference to
the matinge girl. In the book, on which the play
now running at the Sydney Cri. was founded, AVali-
ingford is a typical Fatman, an unromantic citizen
of vast vest-space and stolidly impressive manner.
On the boards he is a slender beauty-man, whose
glib impudence vastly allures the inexperienced
maiden, but would inspire a U.S. business man, how-
ever bucolic, with a desire to ring up the police
and intimate the discovery of a new Fiji uncle.
Wallingford, as he appears at the Cri., is charming,
but Wallingford as he might have appeared (i.e.,
as the personification of Fat), would have been in-
structive. Also, he would have been a novelty. Come
to think of it, the fat, respectable, urbane confidence
man has not been exploited behind the footlights
in the way he deserves.
Charles Frohman’s revival of Pinero’s “Amazons,”
at the London Duke of York’s, is playing to such
big business that it could easily run to the end of
the year if only he could keep a grip of his three
Amazonian beauties, which he can’t. Marie Lohr
is under engagement to join Gerald du Maurier’s
company at the Wyndham Theatre in October;
Phyllis Neilson-Terry has an important part in Beer-
bohm Tree’s new spectacular pageant, dealing with
F. Drake and the Spanish Armada; and Pauline
Chase has to re-visit America, before once more re-
suming the r6le of Peter Pan in London at Christ-
mas.
Chung Ling Soo, the Scotch-Chinaman conjurer,
must have an industrious press agent in his employ,
judging from the number of paragraphs about him in
the papers. Here is a simple one:—
“Chung Ling Soo, whose magic and mystery are
one of the leading attractions at the Hippodrome,
makes his profession the absorbing interest of his
life. At Barnes he has his own engineering* works,
where all the appliances connected with his illusions
are made. When ifi London he is at the bench by
n,r )c in the morning, working and experimenting
until the time for his show. ‘Work with me,’ he
said, ‘is a monomania. I can’t be easiful.’ On a
voyage to Australia, nearly four years ao-o, after two
days of enforced inactivity, he appealed to the cap-
tain to find him work. For the rest of the six weeks
he was stoker, artificer, cook, steward, carnenter
scenic-painter and entertainer. At Fremantle the
passengers were so pleased that they presented him
with a silver cigar-box.”
And this country entertained Donald Chung un-
awares, with no idea that he was a marvel who had
cooked for a big liner all the way from London.
Some theatre items from London: Madge Tither-
adge is to have a big chance in New York (starting
this week) as Juliet to Lewis Waller's Romeo. Mrs.
Forbes-Robertson (whom Australia knew as Gertrude
Elliott) is Cleopatra in Bernard Shaw’s revised play
of that name. Beerbohm Tree, staging a iew play
about Drake, has declined to collar the hero’s part
himself; “my reticence is due to a modesty which
has been forced upon me by wisdom.” “Every-
woman” is being given an English setting, for pro-
duction in London. “The Third Degree” has been
rechristened “Find the Woman.”- “Bunty Pulls the
Strings” has run for a year, is being played nine
times a week, is to go on indefinitely, and has four
touring companies out in Britain and eight in the
U.S.A.
The latest freak of the “Rehearsal Co.” in London
was a performance of seven scenes from “Twelfth
Night,” with all the characters played by women.
Among the male characters the lady Malvolio was,
seemingly, less successful than the Lady Toby Belch,
who made-up remarkably well and hiccupped and
roared rather like a real Toby. Doubtless a less un-
convincing performance could have been perpetrated
by a company of men—but such an assertion of
“equality of the sexes” would be resented by Suffra-
gettes. Since lovely Woman stooped to emancipation,
it isn’t advisable to tell her that any sort of her
sex can be more naturally imitated by a man than
any sort, however drunken, of his sex, can be mim-
icked by a shemale.
“S.T.S.”: I am beginning to be rather sorry for
Carey, sen., in “On Our Selection” (the play). What
has he done to qualify as a villain, anyway ? True,
he wanted his own money back, which is the un-
pardonable sin in melodrama. But old Rudd was
stony-broke, and ought to have filed his schedule
long ago. In putting in an execution Carey was
only getting ahead of the other creditors. Further,
Carey had applied for a nice bit of local land which
he could make good use of; and Dad, who couldn’t,
put in for it and got it—out of mere spite, to all ap-
pearances. Further still, young Carey was inclined
to make a fool of himself with the penniless Miss
Rudd. However, he got killed in her house, and the
family, firmly believing that her other lover had
done it, committed flat perjury to screen him. They
get great applause for this. Carey, sen., gets hisses
for being anxious to see his son’s murderer arrested.
Being (as I suggest) a simple and rather amiable
old gentleman, he carries the warrant about in his
pocket, and is induced by a regular uncle-from-Fiji
trick, to tear it up himself. Then it turns out that
someone else committed the murder, so, apparently,
it didn’t count and becomes a humorous matter; and
old Carey is finally kicked out, literally kicked over
the doorstep, off the ground, by a comic Irishman.
I submit that he is the most innocent, maligned
sufferer, miscalled Villain, in the history of the
stage.
“Busk”: A few tags. Pinero is anxious over fit-
ting casts. For the small part of a dissipated young
fellow m “The Benefit of the Doubt,” he found the
exact individual, with a face that had been leading
the pimpled life. Call him Pharaoh Tompkins. But
Tompkins, on the strength of such a beautiful en-
gagement, turned teetotaller, and became beautiful
to look upon. ‘“Oh. where are your pimples ?” asked
Pinero, like the artist who invited the ragged, dirty
little crossing-sweeper to his studio. The boy’s
mother fetched him along nicely dressed, and cleaned
up, and the artist tore his hair. Pope Pio Nono
was appealed to by a Knight of the Order of St.
Gregory the Great for leave to subscribe to a
golden crown, for Fanny Elssler, the danseuse.
Pope: “Oh, you may, but, I say, is a crown a proper
for the feet?” A gag introduced in Sheridan’s
Rivals was Bob Acres trying in vain to cram upon
his head a fashionable cocked hat. Says a friend:
That’s only to carry under your arm.” Bob: “A
hat for the arm! Damme, that’s rum.” Crummies,
acting King Lear, made two shies, in vain, to get at
one sentence. First: “How sharper than a serpent’s
child it is to have a thankless tooth.” Second: “How
sharper than a serpent’s thanks it is to have a
toothless child.” Charles Kean alwavs substituted
b by m. As Shylock, he said: “You take
away the beans by which I live.” Dampier had to
struggle against this tendency.
REVEALED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Upon the stage the other night
He strode in garments rather fine,
His constant cigarette alight—
Itself a most suspicious sign.
But he was really good to see,
And in the gods’ department we
Were wondering who the man might be,
Until with curling, cynic lips
He dared to sneer at fish and chips!
The sad-eyed heroine was there,
Deserted by her love, alas!
She nibbled poor but honest fare
Provided by the comic lass.
With high silk hat upon his head,
He turned to where the lady fed.
And bitter were the words he said.
We knew him vilest of the rips,
For he had sneered at fish and chips !
The gallery with yells of hate
Beset him, for the foe was found.
He stood revealed, a profligate,
A murderer and lying hound,
A man who’d burn, or steal, or kill
To work his own malicious will.
I hated then, I hate him still,
The blasted toff whose loathly quips
Were coldly cast at fish and chips !
VICTORIA.

The Nearest Railway Point
to the Jenolan Caves.
Described as “the wonder Caverns of the World/’ the Jenolan Caves
have greatly popularised the Blue Mountains with Tourists from
every part of the World. The wonderful formation of Nature—a
source of interest and delight to lovers of beauty—consists of a
cavern chain, littered with huge, fantastic stalactites in glittering
limestone. Each section presents a new and unique formation, and
a visit to these Caves will fully compensate the Tourist for his time
and expense. Connected by road to the Railway, the Caves are
easily visited in one day from Mount Victoria.
Mount Victoria, 77 miles from Sydney, is the radiating point for a
number of Beauty Spots, and possesses an unlimited field of interest
to the seeker of pleasure or health. The Climate is exceptionally
fine; the air fresh and exhilarating, and extremely bracing after the
enervating effects of the Summer heat of the Metropolis.
“ THE IMPERIAL ” —Mount Victoria’s most up-to-date Hotel—is
an ideal home for the Tourist. Purchased by the present Proprietary
in October, 1911, over £7OOO in improvements have been spent upon
the property up to the present. The “Imperial” has its own Light-
ing Plant; its own self-contained Sanitary arrangements and Water
Supply, and the finest Motor Garage outside Sydney.
Although not the largest Hotel on the Mountains, it stands second
to none for comfort and convenience. There are 50 beautifully
furnished Bedrooms; a magnificent Dining Hall, excellent service
and first-class cuisine. Summer Tariff —from November to April:
10/- per day, or £3/3/- per week. Winter Tariff—from May to
October: 10/- per day, £2/10/- per week.
MOTOR TO THE CAVES. A regular Daily Service is run from
the “Imperial” Hotel to the Caves, returning the same afternoon.
The famous “Ttala” Cars are used by the Management, thus making
the trip especially comfortable and interesting. Return fare to
the Caves, 30/-.

HOW “ANTINEURASTHIN”
REMEDIES NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.
It is, in the first place, essentially a food —not a
drug stimulant.
It is a food that feeds the whole of the nervous
system with those elements the lack of which in the
structural tissues constitutes the neurasthenic con-
dition.
It is so easily assimilated that in one hour it is
fully absorbed, thus creating quickly a renewed
mental and physical vigor. This is not mere stimu-
lation, but is really the sensation produced by the
actual assimilation and storage of those refined ele-
ments necessary to nerve comfort and vigor. This
is not —as in the case of tonics and stimulants—a
mere transient whipping up, but an actual addition
to the nerve structure and nerve strength of the in-
dividual. A FREE TRIAL

Britisher (Westralia) : (11 You seem
rather to approve of Freetrade, yet you applaud
Canada, which is much more Protectionist than Aus-
tralia. (2) If the U.S. “high tariff” admits a small
quantity of manufactured goods, it may be because
there are certain goods that it doesn t want to keep
out. The U.S. has a free list, like other places. (3)
You say that Canada has borrowed abroad
£275,000,000 in :-x years (1906-1911), and its
boom shows that borrowing is a good thing. Dear
friend, every place booms while the borrowing mad-
ness is on. That was why Charles Surface, the
spendthrift and borrower, was so much better dressed,
while the loans lasted, than his brother Joseph. (4)
You ask, “Has any State a sinking fund?” Certainly.
The one you are in has a big sinking fund. (5) You
proudlv quote Chiozza Money as a sort of final court
of appeal, and enclose his remarks on the stagnation
of Australia, and sav that the great C. Money “should
require no introduction to us.” He doesn’t. He is
the ass who mistook one year’s increase of population
for ten years’ increase, and not having sense enough
to verify his impressions by looking up a book of
reference, he said things which made him a subject of
mirth. Didn’t you recognise the blunder?... .Billo:
What is wrong with The Bulletin’s statement that
the average school history (the only one that many
people read) is a fraud? It always strains facts in
the interests of patriotism, and it is full of lies or
half-truths inserted to save space, because the facts
would require too much room and too much elabora-
tion. Take three popular school book items at
random: (1) The Roman troops were not withdrawn
bodily from Britain and the island abandoned ; (2)
It wasn't the imposition of a new tea-tax, but the re-
duction of an old tax from Is. to 3d. per lb. that
brought about the Boston tea riots; (3) In the
Armada scrap the English fleet was the stronger of
the two in almost every way. The third represents
the patriotic lie, while the others are the half-truths
that save space and explanation. And there are
hundreds more. ... O’Regan: What are you complain-
ing about? The Bulletin said that it “didn’t
especially blame the Professor of Music for publish-
ing your song. If it resembled ‘Adoration,’ he
might be able to make sense of bits of it.” Have
you the front to say that “Adoration” is so
poor that nobody can make sense of any of it ?. .. .
H.McD.: In the opinion of this office you are a
horror. If you can’t improve your handwriting 700
per cent., your style of writing 900 per cent., and
the ideas on which you base your pars. 20,000 per
cent., in the name of the holy w.p.b. take to some
more lucrative hobby. . . .Madge S.: As you are a
lady we can hardly call you what we might call you
if we were less civilised than we are. In fact, we
rather like you, but do try and write a little bit
legibly. . .liinkabillian: “Plainly and brutally,” then,
the verses are bad, and the alleged ideas have not
yet come to hand. There is no bread-and-butter in
them. Look at this in print:—
Wattle we do,
’Neath Austral’s sky blue
In the hours of our Natal day
We crown right as might
By day and by night,
To reign on for ever and aye.
. ...L.G.G.: Pretty bad verse even of its kind, and
the kind is not high in the lyric scale. .. .R.-H.M.L.:
We like the closing lines of your attack on “Woman”
She’s mother, or she’s sister,
Aunty, cousin or niece
To every son or mister
Of whate’r creed or race.
She’s been the grace an’ love
Of all the sons of men
Since God said Adam, here’s your dove,
She’s our guiding star since then.
....The Sawdust King: Not up....Longy: Verse
awful. One par might do. .. . Epacris: “Red Heath”
is too indecent for this paper. Only religious jour-
nals can afford to publish information like that....
J.L.8.: We admire “Thoughts under a Gum Tree”
more than we can say. Don’t know what’s it about,
but this stanza nearly killed the Religious Editor:—•
Drugged by the Marine Magician,
Tasted we of Love’s fruition,
Dreamed we of supreme ambition,
Walking on a wave-washed shore.
Now, my fevered invocation
Brings, of love, no incarnation,
And alass 1 my avocation
Unimportant, as before:
Deeper I in aberration
Since those love-blest days of yore.
. ...H.G.: “Man and His Environment” is a very
elementary effort. Anyhow, this isn’t a physics class,
although, if you can make physics interesting we
might throw out the latest camel yarn to make room.
But judging by this effort you’re not able Imma-
ture Moll: The venerable age of the first of your
“Sundry Cynicisms” which caught our eye (re the
wages of gin being breath) filled us with suspicion
and misgivings, so that we dropped the rest hurriedly
into the wicker oubliette. .. .N. 8.: The “gin breath”
jest was invented in this office. The venerable man
of the staff did it when he was a junior sub-editor
long, long ag0....J. Aw: Nicely rhymed and beau-
tifully written, but not the sort of stuff that appeals
to us. It is too Chapzanderish, for one thing....
J.R.F.: A sad, bleak day, cheered only by two purple
features, viz. (1) the intimation of an infuriated
poet, whose ballad had been severely sub-edited, that,
in revenge, he would never darken our doors again ;
(2) the dropping of your illegible and carelessly flung-
together and in every respect maddening contribution
into the w.p.b... ~.Ivevea: By your own showing the
bogus New Hebrides planter is too palpable a Fiji
uncle to be worth exposing. .. .E.L.: We print the
opening sentence as some faint tribute to the splen-
did opulence, dignity, rotundity, etc., of your style:
“Your esteemed correspondent Randolph Bedford in
one of your issues last year remarked that the Wil-
low Trees in Tasmania were bare of foliage for
several months, as this appeared to me not to be in
line with the usual accuracy of his statements I have
taken careful notes this year with regard to the loss
of verdure on 10 trees within a radius of eight miles
with the following conclusions, six trees had / lost
their leaves (not by any means all but you could see
the branches peeping through) by the 4 July, and
four by the 7th, while seven had regained their
coats on the 23 August, and three on the 28th, the
day of writing”... .Alok (or again it might be
Anak or Maud or George Y.) : An invitation to eye-
strain, pure and simple. Wherefore, since we have
only two eyes, and they but weaklings, your inebriated
looking screed was flung aside, practically unread.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CONTRIBUTORS.
K.U.F.: The picture would hardly have crawled
through even with a new idea attached. What ceme-
tery did you dig that joke out of ? It amounts to
body-snatching. .. .Laurence: The point has escaped
us.... Dunn: It is possible to overdo the low-cut
lady and the high-heeled woman. Your figures are
shrieking impossibilities.... A.W.: The jest is almost
a record for futility... .D.P.: Bear-skin proposition
turned down for obvious reasons, besides its age. The
yarn of the two stutterers is an early PuNCH-ism....
F.G.: The trouble lies in the painful obviousness of
the gag. And the picture arouses no boundless emo-
tion.... Mary G.: Too amateurish. If you are a
young school girl then they show enough early pro-
mise to suggest that, with good tuition, you may
do something. If you have your hair up and are on
the electoral roll, they show a sufficient absence of
late promise to justify you in leaving the job alone.
If you are in the midway or flapper stage, you will
have to toss up.... J.A.E.: There is neither vice nor
virtue in them... .E.H.: The gag is feeble, and the
aged husbandman, with the voluminous tailed coat
made of wood, has got his beard on crooked. The
rest of the picture isn’t very annoying, but the cross-
eyed man who stands head and shoulders over the
bashed and dinted crowd seems to need some explana-
tion... .A. W.: The senseless quip, of course, accounts
for Maud’s mad expression, but where is her other
leg?

Bp
Sir Charles A. Cameron, C. 8.,
M.D., etc.,
writes: “Taking an interest in all
subjects relating to food, I have
procured samples of Sanatogen
and subjected them to experi-
ment. . . .
“In my opinion, it is the or-
ganic phosphorus which makes
Sanatoggn of such value. . . .
A series 'of experiments proved
that Sanatogen is easily and com-
pletely digested. 1 have arrived
at the conclusion that Sanatogen
is a substance of the highest
nutritive value, containing as it
does a large amount of organic
phosphorus—that is, phosphorus
which is offered to the tissues in
exactly' the form in which it can
be easily absorbed. It is an ex-
cellent nerve food.”
“The Medical Times”
says: ‘ ‘ There is no doubt what-
ever that the nutrition of patients
taking Sanatogen improves won-
derfully, due, in all probability,
to its being easy of assimilation
and to the organic absorbable
phosphorus which it contains.”
A thousand times this number of Physicians endorse
SANATOGEN
The Royal Tonic Food.
Over fourteen thousand practising physicians have recorded in writing their high
opinion of Sanatogen, and many thousands more are daily prescribing it with the
most beneficial results in cases of debility, brain fag, lack of vitality, sleepless-
ness, disordered digestion, poverty of blood and various wasting diseases.
Can you ask for more convincing testimony of Sanatogen’s value than the
fact that it is thus publicly endorsed and recommended by practically the whole
medical profession ?
Among the original letters in praise of Sanatoyen which are filed for public
inspection, there are many from world-famous physicians whose names stand
for the highest scientific achievements. Their advice, and the example of
distinguished men like those mentioned here, it is safe for you to follow.
Irresistible as this evidence is, the reader can only realise the wonderful
revivifying effects of Sanatogen by taking it himself when his nervous system
and bodily strength have been undermined by overwork, worry or disease.
WRITE TO-DAY FOR FREE HEALTH BOOK.
You can buy Sanatogen at any chemists. Write to-day for a free copy of
Dr. Andrew Wilson’s diealth book, “The Art of Diving.” Please mention this
paper, and address your postcard to:
A. WULFING & CO.
G.P.O. BOX 1960
SYDNEY.
Prof. Dr. C. A. Ewald,
of Berlin University, writes: “I
have used Sanatogen in a number
of cases, mainly of a nervous or
neurasthenic origin, and have
obtained excellent results.”
Mr. Hall Caine,
the celebrated Author and Dram-
atist, writes: “My experience
of Sanatogen has been that as a
tonic nerve food it has on more
ilian one occasion done me good.”
Mr. W. Rhodes,
the famous Yorksnire Cricketer,
writes : “I have given Sanatogen
a good trial, and found it a
splendid tonic.”
Mr. A. G. Hales,
the famous War-Correspondent;
‘‘ I find my health benefits by
every tin of Sanatogen. It re-
vitalises a man, and is not a
drug.”

THE DAGO MENACE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In 1915 there would bV seven Dreadnoughts be-
longing to various South American States 1
—Cheerful news item.
Oh, the Dago’s partly white,
And sometimes he can fight,
And sometimes he lives on garlic, fish and sago ;
His drink is lemon-squash,
Now and then he’s known to wash—
And 4/ou’ll have to speak respectful of the Dago 1
Oh, the Dago’s often cheap,
And he sweats while we’re asleep—
I don’t think he goes to bed, although he may go !
'Neath the counter he will snooze,
’Mid the fish- or fruit-refuse—
Still, you’ll have to how politeful to the Dago!
He’s both ignorant and slow,
And we often tell him so!
And his anger is the rage of a virago—
For he’ll maim, or take a life,
With his swift and sudden knife!
But you’ll have to take your hat off to the Dago!
lie’s a liar, it may be,
And a fool, perchance, is he,
Who thinks that images of wood and clay go !
But he bristles up his fur,
At the sight of Death astir
And you’ll have to act obsequious to the Dago!
Yes ! —it’s not a pleasant thought
For a Race that dreadeth nought—-
To think St. Jingo second to St. Jago !
But, unless you make things hum
That’s about what’s going to come,
And —Australia will be ivaiting on the Dago!

Like the Commonwealth, the Cold Country
is afflicted with those dreary things that are
called “conferences”; but from recent files
of the London papers it looks as if the de-
plorable state of Bull’s alleged land defences
has shocked even the leathery “Nonconform-
ist Conscience.” At the AVesleyan assem-
blage, held in July last, the report of the
committee on the (more or less) “Religious
Observance of the Lord’s Day” (just as if
the Lord didn’t own all the days!) urged the
conference: —
To omit from its resolutions the paragraph
calling upon the young men of Methodism to hold
aloof from the Territorial Force until the regula-
tions regarding Sunday rifle practice were altered.
Ten or 15 years ago the said conference
would have shouted at the top of its monkey
shave for nine hours, and then hurled forth
the carnal recommedation to the joyful
sound of “Washed in the Blood!” But,
after nine minutes of discussion, the badly-
scared Methodies “unanimously agreed to
this course /” The fear of a future German
edict that would compel it to sing. “Ha
welche Lust, Soldat zu sein!” (“Oh! it’s
grand to be a Soldier!”) at strenuously un-
pleasant Sunday Afternoons, worked this
miraculous metamorphosis. Consequently,
the good young Methody will carry his gun
on the Sabbath, uncursed, in merry England.
But I should like Jimmy McGowen, Our
Mister ’Olman, and all other peace-and-
propriety, anti-Sabbath-ci(bbage heroes to
mourn with me awhile oyier the passing of
another Grand Old Institution. Also,
Pearce might chew on the hymn-book for a
time, and then tell us that, as our father
John Bull is now -following after strange
gods, we, too, may imitate J. 8., and the,
Swiss, and the Germans, and the French, and:
a few more without being prosecuted
for fracturing the blessed Sawbath ! I don’t
suppose that the Lord will offer any Per-
sonal objection.
The Bulletin’s “Old Soldier” re-enters
the lists : *
“Miles” (B. 22/8/T2) misunderstands me. I did
not suggest that .the bayonet is useless in modern
warfare. My sole contention was, and is, that it is
less useful than a number of other things. And it is
these things that the cadets must be taught in the
scant time at their disposal. Nowadays, a line
of infantry must get very close before it can
charge. As far back as half a century ago it was
proved that steady infantry, armed with muzzle-
loading rifles, would stop an advance, even in ex-
tended order, at 300vds. I have seen it done more
than once. Now, steady infantry with magazine
rifles could not be approached within 600yds. over
open ground. A great deal of the fighting in Man-
churia was among high crops, where both sides were
hidden] It must also be remembered that the Japs
were pressed for time, especially after the invest-
ment of Port Arthur, and they no doubt sacrificed
their men recklessly to save time. In the days of
Brown Bess, infantry would engage at 60yds. apart,
fire one or two volieys, and then the line that was
least shaken would charge with the bayonet, a-nd
sweep the other away. Now the infantry will engage
at 800yds. or 1000yds. Tange, the extended lilies 'ap-
proaching each other by rushes, or creeping frpm
cover to cover, firing continuously, and protected by
their artillery. We have it oh the authority of the
commander of the artillery of the Prussian Guard,
that at Gravelotte he was unable to get his 60 guns
within 2500yds. of the French position on the ridge
of Bazeilles: “I was forbidden by the imperative
voices of 6000 chassepots,” he said. As an indica-
tion of what happens during the storming of en-
trenched positions, Nanshan, cited by “Miles,” is a
very good example. The works were manned by
3000 Russians, and the line of works was 4000yds.
long. It was attacked by Oku with 39,000 Japs.
Says Major Maurice in the “Cambridge Mod.
Hist.” :
“As the sun was setting, the infantry of the 4th
Japanese division, wading breast-high through the
ebbing tide of Kinchow Bay, turned the Russian left,
and at last secured a foothold in the position.”
The works had been pounded all day by some 70
or 80 guns, and, presumably, the 3000 Russians had
not much strength remaining in them, since they
left 700 dead behind in the works.
What I question is not whether the bayonet is
worth while, but whether there is time, in the 64
hours annually allowed for drill, for the lads to
learn bayonet drill in addition to the three essential
M’s—Marching, Musketry and Manoeuvre., By all
means teach not only bayonet drill, but fencing and
single-stick. They are excellent in their way. Butt
add another 36 hours to the drill required, so that
the essentials shall not suffer. You cannot teach a
soldier anything that may not be useful to him some-
times on service. The difficulty is to find time to
teach him everything.
“Adelaide”: A rustic tragedy in Shak-
speare’s day. (Its only connection with
Australia is that it appears in the chronicles
of Theberton, a Suffolk village whence
came Light, the founder of Adelaide, which
now has a flourishing suburb of the same
name.) It appears in the diary of the local
park-keeper :
Item, the Mundaye before Mvchaelmes da.ye cam in
a dogge of Johnson’s, the schoemaker, and kyllyd ij
dooes, and then the dogge was take up, and I sende,
to hym to wete wether he wold have the dogge
agayne, and he send word naye, and then I hynge
him upon a tree.
Poor old dogge! These were cold days for
the bowe-wowwe animal.

HILL-CLIMBING
is only one Fine Feature of Dalg'ety Cars
In the Austrian Alpine Contest, the Press Car was a 38-h.p. DAIMLER (one of the Dalgety
Agencies), ancl the Special Correspondent writes, in the Autocar, as follows: —
“We had to cross the two steepest passes in the Alps, viz., Tauern and Katschberg. The Tauern is
nearly 6000 ft. high, and the Katschberg well over 5000 ft., but it was the gradients rather than the altitude
that we found to be the major obstacles.
“Our 38-h.p. DAIMLER made light of its task, and ascended with ease, but chiefly on the bottom speed,
which of itself indicates the severity of the ascent. Some 30 miles from the start, we struck the Loibl Pass.
The height is well under 5000 ft., but as an ascent it is as stiff a proposition as could be conceived. In the
first place, the gradients themselves are probably from one in five to one in six. My fellow-passengers,
indeed, averred that the rise was worse than that of the Katschberg. In the second place, hairpin bends
were numerous and all extremely rough, whilst, in the third, the road abounded in humps and gullies. The
climb was extended oyer kilometres, and of this distance the major portion was appallingly steep. After
our experience on Tauern and the Katschberg, however, we had no fears whatever for our SILENT
KNIGIIT DAIMLER.
“As regards steepness, however, the Loibl may not be in actual figures auite as high as our friend
the Katschberg—l cannot pledge myself that it is not—it is certainly not child’s play, and I should be sorry
to tackle it with any car in which I had not the completest confidence. This we fortunately possessed, and
were amply justified. The car sailed by in triumph, passing every other that was within measureable
distance, and we reached the summit without a falter. We turned to the descent with the certainty of
having something equally steep in the way of gradient, as the valley lay visibly below us at an enormous
depth. The road nroverl just as rough and badly graded as on the ascent, and both by reason of the
caniveaux and the steepness of the valley, we went down against compression with one or two others, and
the lower gears engaged and the clutch in. The DAIMLER SILENT KNIGHT engine, by the way, confers
exceptional advantages in this respect.”

To Kill Hair.
ELECTROLYSIS AT HOME. APPARATUS
i Returnable when done with.
SuMtfuous hairs on the face or . arms can only be
got rid of in one way. The roots must be dissolved
by electrolysis.
The well-known Mme. Tensfeldt, one of the most
noted beauty experts in Britain, has for some years
been, supplying to ladies, unwilling to pay the ex-
pense of repeated treatment for superfluous hair, a
portable and simple apparatus, for home use. Thanks
to the clear explanation which Mme. Tensfeldt sends
with it, ladies can use it for themselves before a
looking-glass, or a servant or freind can apply it.
The apparatus is charged for one year, and it works
perfectly, without pain or shock, while absolutely
destroying the root of each individual hair. Success
is guaranteed.
Home electrolysis is not like the pastes and fluids
with' which ladies have, until now, had to be con-
tent. These substances burn the hair but do not
touch the root; the hair drops out—dead. The root
is completely dissolved, and it is impossible that
hair should ever grow again from the same root.
The Tensfeldt Home Electrolysis outfit will be sent,
carriage paid, to any part of the world for £5 55.,’
international money order or banker’s draft, payable
in the United Kingdom ; and when the apparatus is
done with it can be returned, carriage paid—pro-
vided it is sent within six months—and an allowance
of £1 6s. in cash will be sent immediately in ex-
change for it. The address is Mme. Tensfeldt, 120 a,
I'rinees Street, Edinburgh, Scotland,*

IN BANANA LAND
David Bowman, like the sons of Geo. 111.,
didn’t last long enough to come into his king-
dom. Asthma and other miseries have
broken him up, and he retires to the position
of a private member, leaving his mantle to
T. J. Ryan, of Barcoo. Even his worst
enemies wish the retiring leader well.
•‘Don Q.”: “Suspending the operation of
the Act” is a chronic habit with Digby Den-
ham’s crowd. Last year a Bill was passed
to deal with the vendor of adulterated boots
and shoes. It was ordained that pieces of
old cardboard and decayed newspapers
should no longer masquerade as leather, and
there was a general air about the ordain-
ment or ordination that bespoke real earn-
estness of purpose. But Denham wanted to
be as kind as possible, and gave the sellers
of shoddy six months in which to get rid of
their existing stocks. Then, in reply to an
influential deputation of importers, he pro-
mised, to extend the term for unloading the
rubbish for another six months. Finally,
whpn faced by a second and more determined
mob of foreign traders, he agreed to con-
sider the question of repealing the Act alto-
gether. Similarly, in the matter of the
Wages Boards and Factories Act, Minister
Barnes boasts that his Department has com-
pelled 59 sweaters of industry to refund a
sum of £l7OO which had been filched from
employees by illegal retention of wages. By
the look of things, 59 persons have to thank
the “suspension of the operation of the Act”
that they are not where some other people,
who steal £l7OO or even 3s. sid., so often
find themselves.
“Jup” speaks his mind :
The sacrifice of Ken Grant marks the beginning;
of the end of the Kidston influence in Queensland
politics. Grant was a bad man to lose and Blair is
a poor one to have acquired. The newcomer has the
place-and-power hunger to a marked extent, and the
Ministry is divided enough without the introduction
of fresh trouble. In spite of a paper majority for
the Government of 22, the malcontents reduced it to
two oh a division on the Industrial Peace Bill.
Appel, whose handling of the general strike foolish-
ness excited general derision, is understood to be
marked for slaughter. Meanwhile, Blair and Macart-
ney are palpably wondering why Denham hangs on
to a job that they could fill so much better them-
selves.
“Kobbi”: One result of the Macgregor’s
sojourn in Bananaland’s gem country, a
while back, was the sparkling exhibit at
Brisbane’s recent show. The value of
stones shown in the rough, cut and mounted
stage is estimated at £6500. Every color
was there. One exhibitor alone had 200 oz.
of gems, cut and uncut, while most of the
“biggest to date” stones on the field were on
view, including the one that Macgregor got
in the course of his alleged toil. Tracking
back on the long-dried pages of the inky way,
I found that gems were discovered in Queens-
land as far off as ’75, and that some of
the earlier shows were in full going order in
’SI. An attempt, 10 years later, to estab-
lish a European market fell as flat as a mess
of pottage thrown at a distant telegraph pole.
In 1900 there were only 12 miners at work
on the field, but now about 550 grub out a
living there. Then this slab of truth fell
on my intellect and made me leap. Most
of the stones are sent to Germany to
be cut. Isn’t there anybody in Australia
cannMe of making a lapidary’s wheel go
round?
APPEL ,
Queensland 's

Secretary.
William Clarke, of Brisbane (Q.), bas
been raking in sundry odd and anci-
ent corners, with a view to classifying
the yarns re the end of Ludwig Leichhardt,
the explorer who tackled a job that was
much, too big for him. A scrap or flinder
of evidence torn off the tail of the garment
of Possibility comes from one Walsh, now of
Broomehill (W-A.). Walsh avers that once
when he was camped on Slashers Creek, a
stream which trickles or dries into the
Thompson (W.Q.), an old fatherly nigger
told him that when a boy he had seen three
dead white men on the bank of Lake
Buchanan. They had come from the west,
evidently making back, and Buchanan is
salt. The nigger had never been on horse-
back, and when it was suggested that he
should mount a gallant steed and show
Walsh the scefie of the find, he dispersed in
dismay. Still, all dead white men are not
Leichhardt, any more than all old cannon
found on the Barrier reef were thrown over-
board by Cook, or all saplings near Cook-
town are the tree that Cook’s old ship was
tied to. Another point of interest men-
tioned in Clark’s memoirs, published in the
Courier, deals with Colin Archer, one of
that ilk who knew good squatting countrv
when they saw it. Colin Archer, after
taking a hand at the squatting business,
turned his tracks back to Norway, where he
designed and built the Fram, of . Nansen
fame and failure. So, after all, Australia
had a hand, though a very remote one, in the
discovery by Amundsen of the South Pole
(since Amundsen aforesaid used Nansen’s
Fram).
, The letter of “F. 8.” :
In the opinion of Governor Macgregor, the recent
General Booth was the greatest man of the nineteenth
century. Said he: “According to historians, the
two greatest men of last century were Napoleon and
Bismarck. One deluged Europe with blood; the
other cursed civilisation with armaments. Mr.
Booth relieved as much misery as the other two
men caused. ’ My humble idea is that Macgregor
ought to have more sense. Booth was a religious
parasite. He dared -not denounce the real causes of
the evils he saw around him for fear of offending
the rich people from whom he derived so many sub-
scriptions. So he banged-the big drum, and pounded
the loud tambourine, and put a sor.t .of porous
plaster of piety on the external symptoms, and made
the outside of the platter clean, and whitewashed
the sepulchre. Pauperism, hunger, misery and in-
sanity grew around him, and he did nothing to
diminish them. He tried to establish a servile race
of religious fanatics ; and he believed, not in making
the masses independent and self-reliant, so that they
wouldn t need Booth, but in a vast system of what
he regarded as charity, with Booth as the glorified
centre thereof. A completely successful Booth would
have made the world a gigantic workhouse, with a
rug drum at the front door and a big snuffle at the
back. Napoleon I. and Bismarck certainly, by their
military devices, led to the killing’ of a lot of people
who would have died in any case. But, so far as
their social policy went, they aimed at making
the masstes independent, solvent and upstanding.
Booth was only great on benevolence, which is a
device by which rich sweaters! and monopolists give
a trifle of ill-gotten money to a hook-nosed middle-
man and gam credit thereby. And the hook-nosed
middleman gives the money to the poor, if they are
sufficiently pious and humble and obedient to the
hook-nosed circumstance. And thereby the poor are
taught habits of dependence and pauperism, and
there is much applause for the hook-nosed intervener,
and for the rich loafers and sweaters and rack-
renters who handed him the funds. The verdict is
that one Napoleon nr Bismarck, or even Robespierre,
is worth many Booths, T '
The Recipe.

QUEENSLAND.
F. BORN.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, September 7, 1912.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
It was a rejuvenated and invigorated
.Viceroy who returned to us on Wednesday
morning from the wilds of Central Queens-
land. From all accounts he had been having
the glad time of his vice-regal life, chasing
the panting kangaroo, and pursuihg with
the sinuous whip the bounding bull and the
aerial and spiral cow. Evidently such peace-
ful occupations are 'good for Governors who
begin to feel the strain of wearing a cocked
crown, and ought to be regularly prescribed
as a tonic for weary greatness. Lady Den-
man also looked much better for her sojourn
amid green pastures and still waterlioles.
Lady Barttelot was motored to Pinkenba by
the Collins lady, under whose roof she had
for some days spread her blankets.
The Denmans and their suite scattered
away from our city per Lucinda, and in-
stead of the whole awed and solemnly happy
population turning out to speed the parting
guest, the only witnesses of their departure
were one aide, two soldiers, a lonely Premier
and a silent Speaker. Someone had, as
usual, blundered, and the chill of the proceed-
ings was rendered the more Antarctic by the
fact that things were meant to be quite
otherwise. The G.-G. had himself expressed
a wish to shake the entire population by
what it lifts its tea-cup with before leaving,
and no one had remembered to tell the public
to come along and be shaken. It was a
splendid opportunity missed, but six noisome
rubbish carts, lined up along the route to the
wharf, tried their utmost to make things
cheerful. In spite of everything, however,
George Five’s understudy said he was
pleased with us, and wanted to visit our big
State again, and have another look at his
friend, the prickly pear.
The Wee Macgregors have only twice
shown us the light of their countenances
during this week. They attended the Mater
Misericordise ball on Wednesday evening,
and visited the United Service Institution
on Friday afternoon. On the latter occasion
the Wee solemnly removed the duster, towel
or other drapery that hid from view the
classic countenance of George V. The effigy,
bust or ornament thus released from obscur-
ity is the gift of Mr. Guelph himself.
The Mater ball was well attended, though
it lost a number of its usual supporters
owing to the fact that the medical staff' of
the Goodna Asylum had a dance arranged
for the same night. The latter was an hilari-
ous affair, and a number of enthusiasts from
town who helped it to hilare brought their
weariness of eye and limb home by special
train in the younger hours of the morning.
The Denham lady and Mrs. Arthur Pierson
were the chaperones.
On Monday night, Mrs. Arthur Earl and
daughter Ruby entertained a clump of the
Younger Set at a “small and early” in honor
of Miss Mary Coates, a Sydney girl who has
been wintering with them. The only other
leap which happened this week was the
Arcadians’ ball on Friday. It was a thrill-
ing affair, and the garments worn carried a
cheerful suggestion of the world, the flesh
and the Beelzebub.
A local “holy Willie” has been working up
a feeling of shocked unhappiness over the
alleged indelicacy of the representations of
well-known paintings and statues at the
Empire by Henriette de Serris and her clever
company. Whether on account of his stric-
tures, or in spite of them. Henriette is getting
crowded and appreciative houses.
The scent of the wattle which filled all
Adelaide-street with sweetness on Tuesday
night proclaimed to a wondering universe
that the Women’s Club was on the rampage,
and meant to do its little best to promote
the observance of an annual Wattle Day. A
committee was appointed. Mrs. Lou Bond
and Mrs. Frank Little spoke pleasantly on
the national flower theme. A youthful male
contributed a very long and extremely de-
tailed paper on the various forms of the
bloomy vegetable, and then everybody got to
work seriously on the supper. Some songs
helped the programme through to a quiet
finish.
The Toombul branch of the Q.W.E.L. met
at Eschenhagen’s on Tuesday afternoon to
compel Miss Elsie Munro to become the
owner of a gold wristlet watch. The lady
certainly deserved all she got, since for nine
long years she has served the branch, either
as its treasurer or secretary. On the occa-
sion of the presentation, cups foamed or
sizzied with fragrant tea, and Mrs. Hutton,
Mrs. Stirrat and Andrew Petrie said plea-
sant things to the recipient of the gift.
Mrs. W. T. Robertson gave a big At Home
at her pretty Indooroopilly home, lona, oh
Thursday. Her garden was a joy to heart
and eye, and an excellent band was coyly
hidden under the branches of a sheltering
palm. The hostess, a lady whose dress sense,
or instinct, or feeling is highly developed,
wore a white lingerie frock, a large Tuscan
hat and a cloud of veiling garlanded with
fuchsia flowers. About 200 of our Very
Vest People drank tea and nibbled cake, and
then the whole mass of guest left in a hurry
and a cloud of dust to catch the train to
town.
Very few of the usual devotees were at
the races, and as far as frocking is con-
cerned, it was a coat and skirt day. The
weather was dusty and gusty. Among the
ardent racegoers whom I saw blown over the
lawn were Mrs. Jack Fihelly, Mrs. Peter
Murphy, Mrs. Buchanan, Mrs. Charlie
Buchanan, Mrs. Frank Wilson and a small
assortment of other female persons.
Dr. Harold Bourne and Nurse Brown
(lately of England, but at present reading
temperatures at the General Hospital here)
have conspired together to tempt matri-
monial fortune, and there is a matter of the
same kind reported between Muriel Duff and
one Norman Anderson, a feeder of sheep or
oxen in the Gladstone district.
One of our weddings of the week was that
in which Ethel Kennedy, the eldest daughter
of A. S. Kennedy, of the Education Depart-
ment, swore her plighted curse to Clement
VVethered, of Glenugie Station (N.S.W.).
and a similar nuptial bargain was struck
between little Miss Russell, of Bowen Hills,
and Burrell Gray, who successfully combines
the avocations of chemist and all-roi'inc’
sportsman. _ A pestle-and-mortar, a bicycle
and a full-rigged yacht occupied front seats
on the Wedding cake.
Anyone who owned, or hoped to acquire,
any sort of interest in a Scotch ancestor,
hurried to the Exhibition Hall to-night and
endeavored to obtain the best seat for his
money. It was a braw Caledonian nicht,
and every item on the programme was thrift-
ily applauded. Miss Bessie Fraser, from
your aged and untidy city, was the star
performer. The boy and girl members
of the noted dancing tribe of King are
hereby awarded generous bouquets of
thistle and wild haggis for the part
they took in the uproar. A pipe band
also contributed to the gaiety of that por-
tion of the Scotch nation assembled, and a
small dog, which might have had a Gordon
setter among his distant relatives, tried hard
to assist the melody. He was ejected with
violence.
Yours imperishably,
Australia Jane.
The inclusion of James Blair in the Den-
ham Ministry, and the departure of K. M.
Grant therefrom, is by no means a com-
fortable change for the Q. Premier. It con-
firms the oft-stated charge of the undue
potency in the Ministry of the South, and it
leaves the Centre, North and West, about
75 per cent, of Bananaland, with only one
representative in the Cabinet. In fact,
Denham’s Government becomes mostly a
Queen-street Ministry, which is the old
trouble over again. It would not be sur-
prising, under the circumstances, if Towns-
ville and Rockhamption again joined forces,
as in the days of yore, to combat the southern
influence. What the ambitious and able
men of the Liberal party (of whom Forsyth
os the foremost) will say to the elevation of
Blair, who is only a recent recruit, may well
be imagined. Grant’s exit deprives Denham
of his most popular Minister. The clouds
are thickening round the Q. Premier’s head.
Alas ! for Denham !
Doomed to the hardest task of man alive —
To make three billets do the work of five.
David Hay Dalrymple is now humping his
swag among the stars. He died at the age
of 72. His early career doesn’t matter much,
for he was just the usual kind of business
man, mayor, etc. The day of his greatness
commenced when Plugh Nelson made him
Secretary for Public Ignorance in 1895. He
was also in the Byrnes Ministry, the Dick-
son Ministry, and the first Bob Philp Min-
istry. .As a speaker he was good; as a con-
versationalist he was excellent; and as a
humorist he wasn’t too horrid. Regarded as
a Minister,, some people said in the bitter-
ness of their hearts that he might have been
improved upon, without wrecking the Con-
stitution or knocking the bottom out of the
country’s prospects. He took little or no
interest in his work. There is still told a
vile and mouldered tale about a time when
he held the two portfolios of Agriculture and
Public Instruction, and had to receive two
deputations in one day. To the first, which
dealt with the bucolic industry, he gave a
vague and general assent. That is to say,
he looked at the ceiling and said “Oh, yes.”
The Public Instruction deputation came on
afterooon, when disgust at the whole
Ministerial job had eaten into Dalrymple’s
soul. He listened t 6 it as one buried in
great abstraction, thep sat up suddenly, and
looked at it with the . sort of eye that 'Solo-
mon used, when he said that all was vanity*
and told it in a general way that he would
endeavor to get the duty taken off guano,'
and that he recommended forest conservation
and ringbarking. Then he left by a back
door, and the deputation fainted standing,-
and walked out like a, teacher in a dream.

The Complete
Works of Guy
De Maupassant
Issued to Subscribers only
. . by
The Standard Publishing Co. Pty., Ltd.,
Publishers of the Complete Works of
Shakespeare, Balzac, Dickens, Scott,
Thackeray, etc.
IT is a literary event of more than ordinary im-
portance that The Standard Publishing Co. are
able to announce the issue to subscribers of a
complete and admirable translation of the entire
Works of Guy De Maupassant. 1
Henri Rene Guy De Maupassant is by well|nigh
universal consent the greatest short story writer in
all literature. It was when Baudelaire translated
the short stories of Edgar Allan Poe that the French
attempted to achieve mastery in one of the most
difficult forms of art. < , H .
Maupassant and Gautier alone improved upon their
teacher. But Gautier's chief fame rests Upon his
poems and his romances. Maupassant produced a
series of little masterpieces, which are unsurpassed
for ingenuity of conception, for perfection of detail,
and..fpr an almost miraculous adroitness in .the' pre-
sentation of character and incident within the' 1 tipiest
limits. The unwinding of one of his stories .igf one
of the fascinations of literature.
His stories deal with innumerable details of the
human comedy as it presented itself to Maupassant’s
ever-observant eye. He has given us strange tales of
travel and adventure of weird mystery and aw.esome
dread, and of the pure comedy that iS'. never; far
absent from human circles. ~ ;
Only a few of these masterpieces have found t Heir
way into English print. Strangely enough,, this is
the first collected edition which has ever appeared in
England. It has also been left for the Publishers to
make this edition more complete than the authorised
French edition. V.
This Standard . Edition, in fact, contain? .-many
stories and sketches which have actually neVer been
republ shed in France, and are now for the first time
rescued from the oblivion of the magazines, in vrtiich
they originally appeared. /
THE GENERAL FORMAT. —The Standard Edition
is an endeavor to produce a set of the vi Complete
Works of De Maupassant, which will conform ip the
best dictates of style and art.
the ILLUSTRATIONS. —There are thirty through-
out the set, from original drawings by 1 noted French
and American artists. A -number were executed by
De Maupassant's friends —who declined compensation
—contending that it was an honor for them to show
their admiration in this way for his works.
THE PAPER. —The paper used in this edition was
specially made, and is, therefore, of one color and
quality throughout. It is a pure antique, with
deckled edges. ') j;
THE PRINTING. —The printing was ,-done . f|om
original type and not from plates. This (ensures a
special clearness. A new font of French Elzevir
type, bold and elegant in design and to r«ad,
was specially cast for and used in this edition.
There are good margins to every page.
THE BINDING. —It has been our to secure
simplicity and quiet elegance in the bindings. .The
books are handsomely bound in Blue Vellum Cloth,
With distinctive brown and gold title labels.
ANALYSIS OF THE SEVENTEEN
VOLUMES.
IN THE FIRST FIVE VOLUMES the 'ahtlior pic-
tures, with marvellous skill, the virile noyijl tv: of
country scenes, and the comedy and tragedWpnder-
lying the whirl of Parisian life ,in fashiohhßfc: ,draw-
ing-roonis, in studios of art, in greenrooms ojtyppera
and theatre, and in the Quartier Latiii of students
and grisettes. 1 j
THE SECOND SECTION OF FIVE VOLUMES
contains the Romances which caused Tolstoi to hail
De Maupassant as the supreme realis,t ahd romance
writer of his century. Here are found, the' daring
explorations of his subtly intelligent .mind into; the
emotions of the heart of womankind.
THE THIRD SECTION OF FIVE VOLUMES em-
braces the Dramas, Poems and Travels, the _ last-
named sparkling with gems of description-—Meisson-
nier-like pictures in words —of Spanish, Italian,
siean and Oriental life. The shorter Romances fare
also included. t
THE FOURTH SECTION contains stories belong-
ing to no one particular phase of life, unless it piay
be human passion. Love and laughter, tragedy and
tears run side by side in these two volumes, the last
of the series. f
AN APPRECIATION.
Elbert Hubbard writes: — j
“This man never wrote to please the rabble. He
wrote because he had a message for the world,, and
because Divine Energy forced it through his
De Maupassant wrote with the conviction • that: in
life there could be no phase so noble or so mean, so
honorable or so contemptible, so lofty or so low, as
to be unworthy of chronicling ; no groove of hinjjan
virtue or fault, success or failure, wisdom or Jolly,
that did not possess its own peculiar psychological
aspect, and, therefore, demanded analysis. If occas-
ionally some intellectual pigmy, after reading,
screams in falsetto, please remember, spontaneity
and mediocrity are never kin. A WARNING: ’Those
of you who find enjoyment in blue-milk, brain-wander-
ings should never seek De Maupassant..-' You, will
be disappointed. You will not be able, to-digest nor
assimilate the strong elixir of his mint!, so it will
curdle in your gullet—-then it’s you for mental con-
stipation.” V;, .' C'.y ;

Dear Sirs, —
I am writing to let you know how pleased I am with the Aerogen Gas Machine which
you installed at my home, “Clydesdale,” about three months ago. Everything has been
most satisfactory, the machine proving very simple to work, and also very economical.
Ihe light is excellent, both for ordinary use in the house, and for the billiard table. I
will be only too glad to personally recommend it to anyone.
Yours truly, (Sgd.) GEORGE G. KISS.
•‘Yamala,” Frankston,
Dear Sirs, — January 3, 1911.
I send you herewith my cheque for the Aerogen Machine which you supplied to me, as
per your account enclosed.
The light is perfect, and the installation the simplest possible and most convenient.
We find that anyone can manage it with care and complete safety, and it has brought a very
definite joy to my house here in the complete banishment of the kerosene lamps. Our
servants are content, and the cost seems likely to be much lessened.
With many thanks, Very truly yours, (Sgd.) JOHN MADDEN.

For Twelve Months Hands and Lips
Burned and Itched, Sleep Seemed
Impossible, Used Cuticura Soap
and Ointment, Calls the Result
“Marvelous, Cheap and Quick.”
“I suffered dreadfully for twelve mou,_
with eczema and chapped hands. I tried all
medicines recommended by my friends which
all proved failures till I
took my father’s ad-
vice and tried Cuti-
cura Soap. On going
to bed at night my
hands and lips used to
commence to bum and
itch something terribly
and sleep seemed im-
possible as it caused
terrible pain and suf-
fering from the bleeding
and itching, and in the
morning my hands and
lips were all over blood.

“So I took Dad’s advice and tried both
Cuticura Ointment and Soap. I bathed in
Cuticura Soap before retiring for the nig]it
and then treated my face with the Cuticura
Ointment. The result was marvelous, won-
derfully cheap and quick, for in a, month all
trouble on hands and face had disappeared,
“The eczema that my little sister, five
years old, suffered so much from was in her
head. My mother U3ed to apply the Cuticura
Ointment to the scalp on going to bed, which
cured her in a fortnight. My little brother
had a frightful cut on the foot three inches
long and Cuticura Ointment cured it; he
bathed it first and applied the Ointment
afterwards. Marvelousl So you can see the
use of Cuticura Ointment and Soap in our
house is much appreciated, the Soap is also
a beautiful toilet soap.” (Signed) Miss Ida
E. Leary, “Oakwood,” Queens Road, Five-
dock, Sydney, N.S.W., Dec. 19, 1910.
Cuticura Soap and Ointment are sold

An Interesting:
Experiment.
If you would like to see the alteration Grey
Hairs make, just lay a piece of paper over each of
the two halves of the above portrait. The Grey
“ half” will then be seen to have the appearance
of 45 years of age, whereas the other half looks
only 30. Dr. B. Allen’s (U.S.A.) Mexican Walnut
Stain will make all those years of difference if you
are grey or prematurely grey. It is perfectly
harmless, easy to apply, and will quickly restore
the hair to the natural shade of youth, or younger
years.

Those who are troubled with falling hair, dandruff,
baldness, itching scalp, etc., know full well the
humiliation that they cause. There is no need, how-
ever, of such conditions. These troubles can be
quickly overcome by my True Hair Grower.
1 am not an advertising quack, but am a business
man. My hair began to grow thin about the time
I reached the age of thirty. When I had reached the
age of thirty-five the top of my head was quite bald.
1 had considerable pride, and sought for something
to cause renewed growth. I invested in every pre-
paration that I could see or hear of, and here let me
say that not only did I try all the English so-called
restorers, but those of Continental Europe. I also
visited specialists. My experimenting cost me many
sovereigns and considerable time —yet the hairs came
not. I had given up the idea of ever growing hair
again. One afternoon, while enjoying a brief busi-
ness respite by an Alpine trip, I fell in with an old
collegiate chemist, whose hair was particularly plen-
tiful. I jokingly remarked that I wished he could
spare some of his hair for my benefit. This lead him
to tell me that he understood the human hair as well
as a good dentist understands teeth. He wrote out a
formula, and suffErested that T have a quantity of the
compound prepared. I did this a few days later. I
was astonished to see the hair coming forth after
several applications, and within six weeks my head
was covered by a firm, yet soft, black growth of hair.
Since then the hair on my head has been as luxuriant
as when in my school days. Having arranged for
the legal right to do so, I have for some time been
privately selling this marvellous hair-growing com-
pound. I hold over one thousand letters from people
who have actually grown new hair through the
medium of my true hair grower. I do not pretend
to say it is the only hair grower in the world —I am
not interested in decrying others —but I do assert
that it is the most reliable, and in the end by far the
cheapest.

The big steamers still continue to shout warnings
at Australian ports that they are coming, and likely
to continue doing so. Word has been sent along of
the new Union S.S. Co.’s Niagara, which has been
launched at Clydebank, and will probably steam into
its stall, ready to pull out on the first Canada-Aus-
tralia trip about the beginning of next year. It has
a length of 522 ft. and a depth of 374 ft., and its
'gross tonnage will, it is reckoned, figure out some-
where round 13,000 to 14,000 tons. Four of its
boilers are being built to eat coal, but bunkers and
ballast tanks are being constructed so that it can
use them for oil stowage if the oil boilers prove up
to expectations, and if liquid grease can be obtained
at a fair price hereabouts. Its sea speed will be
about 17 knots, so it will be right up amongst the
fliers of these waters. Of course, this 13 or 14 thou-
sand-tonner is small compared to the White Star’s
new 18-thousander, expected here presently, and it
is a Lane Cove ferry alongside the Cunard’s Aqui-
tania and the German lmperator, which will run to
45,000 and 50,000 tons. But the Niagara is a large
■size in ships for the Union Cos. It goes to show the
sure tendency to build bigger boats every year, and
the day is fast approaching when even Sydney will be
turning over plans for deepening its harbor (always
•regarded by the Sydneysider as “The Finest Harbor
in the World”). And then Melbourne will be sitting
out on the deserted pierhead watching the Ships that
Pass in the Night to some of the real deep water
ports that at present are left out in the cold.

“Barney O’Hea”: How is this for an up-to-date
sample of wedding notice advertising?—
“SNOOKE-SIIORE.—On the 21st inst., at the resi-
dence of the bride’s parents, by the Rev. Silas
Slim, James, eldest son of John Snooke, to Maggie,
second and dearly beloved daughter of John Shore,
undertaker, corner Thomas and Nede streets;
telephone 93.”
Out of consideration for the bride I have slightly
altered the names, but the notice is otherwise just as
it fluttered from the press in one of the most teetotal
regions of Maoriland.

“Rubberneck”: These Australians will insist on
going to the fringe of civilisation at the call of gold.
J. S. Hartrick, a Victorian mining engineer, has got
home from a trip through Mongolia, where he went
to look at a quartz reef for a Hong Kong sliindykit.
He went to Ho-char-di, 650 miles nor’-west of
Pekin, travelling in a Chinese cart without springs
and drawn by mules, and the track he travelled upon
was worn down to bedrock by the traffic of cen-
turies, and hadn’t been repaired since the days of
Confucius. The gold occurs in a dyke. formation,
which has been worked for untold ages in the most
primitive fashion. The ore is carefully chipped, and
only the chips that show gold are crushed —in a
mill made of two hard stones, upper and nether
like an old flour mill. After this struggle the stuff
is washed in wooden dishes, and 5 per cent, of the
gold is recovered, while 95 per cent, goes into the
tailings. The gold is put into quills and sent for
sale to Pekin, where it fetches 30s. an ounce
although it is worth 80s. The auriferous belt is said
to be nearly 300 miles long, and is very rich in
places. Yet the pig-tailed incompetent has never,
since the dawn of history, got far below the surface,
and he has never scratched much more than a bare
living and burial expenses out of the business.

“Searchlight”: On Dorrigo (N.S.W.) there is over
£5,000,000 worth of valuable timber easy of access.
The promised railway should reach it, and any
amount more, but every year of delay sees the poten-
tial £ s. and. vanishing in smoke. In other words, it
is burned off. At ieast, an amount equal to the
whole cost of the railway has gone skyward in the
last dozen years. One pine tree, recently cut, pro-
vided timber and to spare for a five-roomed cottage.
“The Pariah”: McClusky, cow-owner and Liberal,
was a passionate believer in Private Enterprise. He
spurned the great co-operative Butter Cos. in his
vicinity, and sent all his grease to a private agent in
Melbourne. His returns were small, and, when he
wrote complaining, he was told that the butter had
arrived in a soft condition. He worked his chilling
plant harder than ever. In vain. After four y ears
he took a holiday, and attended the market. There
was his butter, looking surpassingly good. He
bought it at Is. 2d. Next day he called on the
agent. “Your butter was rather soft this week,”
said the latter brazenly. “It only brought Bsd.”
Then was a torrent of Scotch wrath emptied upon
P. Enterprise, who eventually got out of the fuss by
agreeing to pay top market price over the whole four
years. Mac took his butter to another nrivate agent,
curiously enough. I’m not sure I don’t pity that
agent.
* * * *
“John Dishragge”: Some weeks back I made some
observations on this page re the subtly degrading
influence of washing-up on manners and conversa-
tion. I also mentioned that myself and wife were
inserting cries for help (at the usual rates), in the
helpful morning paper. Well, they were answered at
last by a fresh-faced daughter of old John Bull, and
we are not going to wash-up our dishes any more.
Not the same dishes, anyhow. Miss Bull, who, we
guess, got her washing-up training in an iron
foundry, is retiring next week in good order, leaving
our little collection of china in ruins. Last night
I drank in care-free, picnic fashion out of a
billy lid, after coloring it with milk out of a pickle
bottle. I don’t exactly know how she managed it;
but I know the last vegetable dish, the big meat
dish and five large plates succumbed during the ava-
lanche, which drowned the doctor’s best story last
Friday night. A dropping fire of isolated crashes
kept up till the remains of the last cup had been
rattled on to the dust-pan, and reverently interred in
the dustbox. Then an uncanny silence descended on
the house, and we ceased to jump and cry out. Yes-
terday the dresser contained only a pannikin and a
tin plate; and she dropped both of them in a sad,
experimental way, before she came in, and told us
in an injured tone that she’d be leaving.
AUSTRALIAN OR IMPORTED?
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
At a meeting of the Prahran City Council, the
finance committee recommended that the tender of an
English firm for the supply of a steam road-roller be
accepted.—Carried.
Before all else we must be cheap,
This gospel let us scatter
O’er land and sea, with steady sweep —
What do our workmen matter!
For why should local industries
Be foolishly supported?
I'm tired of hearing words like these,
Australian, or Imported ?
We always love a pantomime
Which English wit produces,
We knqw the worth of Yankee rhyme
And Garvice has his uses;
An aproned Bishop spreads the Word,
From Houndsditch straight escorted,
To doubt his value were absurd —
The tr-r-uth must be imported.
A councillor in old Prahran,
Of local funds controller,
A sound, commercial, whiskered man,
Must hire an English roller.
“Why should we spend a golden pound,”
In righteous wrath he snorted,
“To thump this quite, unhallowed ground ?
I move we vote ‘lmported’.”
And so our weary way we take
In bondage to the alien;
How should we ever learn to make
A good thing marked “Australian”?
Our very Councils bear the brand
That shows their views distorted;
We want our Local Bodies manned
With solid weight, imported.

When food prices go up it is very profit-
able in the aggregate to a country like Aus-
tralia with a surplus of food to sell, but it is
a cold time for one like Britain, which buys
most of its victuals abroad. Thus the Brit-
ish Board of Trade has scratched its dome-
like forehead, and estimated that Bull paid
£55,564,000 more for his imports (most of
the rise being on victuals) in 1911 than he
would have paid if the prices of 1900 had
been maintained, and received £19,177,000
more for his exports. Consequent dead loss
to Bull over £36,000,000.
The S. M. Herald, talking about the
proposed Newcastle ‘(N.S.W.) steel works,
threw a brick at its Joss: —
To take steel rails alone, the quantity of these
which will be required all over Australia is enorm-
ous. Already we have to import most of those we
use from abroad, and we are forced to pay an
exorbitant price for them, in addition to the heavy
item of freight...It is ridiculous to suppose that we
cannot make steel as well as others, or, when every-
thing is taken into consideration, as cheaply.
It is “ridiculous to suppose,” etc. Still,
hasn’t the S. M. Herald been doing just
that kind of “suppose” ever since it was
born?

PUMP GUN
Solid Breech, hammer- |
less. The only pump
gun made bottom ejecting.
The big advantage of this
important feature is appar-
ent to every sportsman.
There is no opening at top,
sides, or rear—ONLY AT
BOTTOM of solid breech.
No dirt, rain or other for-
eign substance can reach
tlie working parts. The
solid breech also protects
the shooter’s eyes and face
irom all possibility of in-
jury that might result
from defective shells,
etc.
W ithout question, the j

able pump gun ever used

THE NEW FEATURES OF THIS REGISTER.
Nine separate totals In pounds, shillings and
pence of different kinds of transactions and of the sales of different
assistants, in addition to grand total of all cash sales.
Amount of each cash sale made by each assistant is
automatically added into a separate total. Every time a sale is made
the amount is added to the total previously shown for that assistant.
Every penny received for cash sales is recorded twice by
this register—on the adding wheels of the assistant making the sale
and on the “secret” or grand total adder. A printed record giving full
particulars is made at the fame time.
Amount in pounds, shillings and pence received in payment of
accounts is shown on another set of adding wheels. This obviates the
necessity of going through dockets or cash book to find how much money *
has been received on account—the total is ready at all times.
Total value of all goods sold on credit is recorded separately. A
glance will show the amount of credit business for the day or to date
from any stated time. This record enables the shopkeeper to see at once
what his total turnover has been.
Every penny paid out is added to previous total amount of
disbursements.
Think of the advantages of having all these separate totals and of
being able to obtain such valuable information by merely turning a key
and glancing at the records.
THESE ARE SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENTS.

ARE YOU
DEAF?
It you are deaf, or going deaf, von will be glad
to hear of a simple and scientific device which will
restore your hearing, no matter how old you are.
there is no mystery or secrecy about it ; we describe
it tully and explain just how it acts.
You use spectacles as sight magnifiers, and in the
same way you may use this sound magnifier as an
Sl*? weak hearing. But, unlike spectacles, the
ivilson Common-sense Ear-Drums are invisible and
comfortable. You can’t tell you are wearing them.
No one else can, either, because they are not seen.
They rest the ear nerves by taking the strain off
them—the strain of trying to hear dim sounds.
What a blessed relief to have done with that
tiring strain!
Being made of the purest and softest Para rubber
they cannot be felt, even when the head rests on a
pillow. For the same reason, a blow on the side of
the head will not hurt the ear. In fact, they pro-
tect the ear, the tender inner parts that are so
senstive, from cold winds, dust, sudden and piercing
sounds.
So that you may clearly understand why these
facts are true, and why the Sound Magnifier restores
the hearing, we give an illustration of one as it lies
in the ear. You will notice that the Sound Magni-
ed
&<?
1?
fier is shaped
like a trumpet,
and so con-
veys even the
faintest sounds
right to the
natural ear-
drum. Being
of the softest
rubber, it can-
not hurt the
ear. It fits the
orifice of the
ear with preci-
sion and com-
fort. The di-
vision that
runs across the
mouth is to al-
low the remo-
val and inser-
tion of the
Ear-Drum, and
to brace it.
Th e shape
of the Wilson
Ear-Drum has
been chosen
after years of
experience a s
the best adapt-
natural'eardrum. fai " tesi ’' S ° Und righV " do ' 7n “ *>“"&*
P £ S r Who a , re ? early deaf > it: is not only
E 1"!/" have P?o ple shout at them, but it hurts
,'7 hen , a « e oomes the ear-drum some-
times gets thickened, or loses its tightness, and
shouting does not act properly on it. It only
makes a confused and tiring noise. But the
bound Magnifiers concentrate the sound in the best
spot for perfect hearing.
Of course, if you have lost the hearing-nerve
completely, or were bom deaf, we cannot pretend
to cure you. Only a miracle could do that, in spite
or some of the absurd claims made to-dav. But if
you can hear the faintest sound, do no"t despair.
You will never regret trying the Wilson Ear-Drums,
n e have letters to show you from deaf people in
Australia and New Zealand, who have been cured,
and you can be cured, too. You may wear the Ear-
Drums day and night., and take them out whenever
you wish. Children can wear them (we have spe-
cial sizes for children from six to twelve). Even
a child can insert and remove them without the
least danger.
The price is £1 (the fee for a doctor’s single
visit). This includes a pair of drums (they
are only sold in pairs), a fine nickel remover and
also an inserter. After the first pair is bought you
may purchase a single drum at any time for Bs.,
but the pair you get at first will last quite
two years. Do not ask for a trial pair. We do
not send them out on trial, and so they are never
secondhand. Use the Order Form below, and the
Outfit will be sent you at once, with the fullest
instructions. Don’t delay, but have the comfort of
good hearing as soon as you can.

IT MAKES YOU SHUDDER!
No matter how dainty food may be, or how carefully prepared, it ;s
simply repugnant to you if your stomach is out of order. That dull pain
in your stomach causes you to simply loathe the sight of food—you cannot
eat, and yet you want something and don’t know what. When you do eat,
you suffer tortures afterwards. Do you realise what will happen to you
if you continue in this way? Your body will become depleted and any;
sickness is apt to take hold of you. If you escape such evils, you will do
as lots of other dyspeptics have done—die of exhaustion.
YOU POSITIVELY CAN AVOID ALL THESE TROUBLES BY TAKING
DR. SHELDON’S DIGESTIVE TABULES.
The reason why any wholesome food is not properly digested is
because the stomach lacks some important element of digestion. Some
stomachs lack peptone, others are deficient in gastric juice or hydrochloric
acid. The one thing necessary in any case of poor digestion is to supply
those digestive elements which the stomach lacks, and nothing does this so
thoroughly and safely as DR. SHELDON’S DIGESTIVE TABULES.
They digest what you eat, thus giving the stomach a rest and assistance
until it is restored to its normal action and vigor.

One of these Tabules will digest 1500 grains

They are a genuine tonic, because they bring
about in the only natural way a restoration of nerve power, a building up
of lost tissue and appetite, by the digestion and assimilation of wholesome
food.

Buck Up!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I AM growing bald and ancient, old
desires are fading fast;
When “the boys” get on the warpath
I have got to up and scud;
For while Youth may be Time’s master
there’s a day that dawns at last
When Time ranges up beside you and re-
marks : “All Flesh is Mud.”
But to me it doesn’t follow that because we
drop the pace
That we need to be downhearted and to cut
joy from the bill.
There is no place for the geezer with the
all-is-over face
Save a cold and cheerless section in the bone-
yard on the hill.
There’s a little cosy corner in a tucked-in
pub I know,
Where the racket never finds me when I
want to steal away;
There’s a flash of eyes and liquor that re-
flects the long ago;
And the girls are in the smoke-wreaths —
dear, lost girls of yesterday.
I am back again with Mollie on the star-
track by the sea;
I can smell the ti-tree’s blossom; I can see
the true-love star;
I can hear the crooning water —all the
thrills come back to me,
Where I dream with pipe and whisky in the
corner of the bar.
All the gay and careless spirits of the festive
days of old,
They have scattered to the four-ways and
the stranger fills their place—
Some are lost and some arp married, some
are sleeping in the mould,
While their tankards iie unneeded where the
spider spins his lace.
But I keen mine brightly polished, and I
pour the golden beer
(Though I can’t pour what I’d like to for
the morning means a head),
And I drink the old toast standing: “To the
joy of being here” —
For I’d rather go on crutches than be posted
with the dead!
Don’t go crawling to the graveyard with a
tear-drop in your eye—-
What you’ve done you’ll have to pay for
when you pass beneath the sod —
Better see life out in comfort; you can bet
that by-and-bye
A tale of all the joys you missed will cut no
ice with God.

BILLY B.
Down for the Farmers’ Con-
ference.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ terrible lucky. Three weeks more,
and it would have been all u-p, as the saying
is. I was in the township, and Sarah telly-
phoned in: ‘Ninety points and still going
strong. Mine’s a trip to Sydney.’
“Sarah hadn’t been one to go much on
politics, but after that when she knew that
the Farmers’ Conference was coming, I
never saw so dreadful anxious a girl to save
the country. And Dad was always the man
to give ’em a few points. I kin talk, you
know. Once when Holman was touring, he
called in for a bit of 'tucker. Of course, I
chipped him, and when he was pushing his
plate away, he says: ‘Sir, you’re a terrible
hard man to argue with.’ That’s me. So
we’re down to the conference.
“Terrible handy things tellyphones is
in the country. The Government runs out a
main trunk, and then drops spurs two miles
each side. The cockies hitch on, dozens of
them. There isn’t what you’d call much
privacy, but yer get used to that. ’Most,
any time you can pick ’er up and listen to
’em gigging all round. We have tellyphone
concerts in the evenings. Somebody has a
new piano-piece, and there’s a bloke 30 miles
away who’s a daisy on the bushman’s bag-
pipe, and there’s phonygraphs all ways. We
do things all right.
“But it’s a terrible starved service. The
tellyphone is the tellygraph as well. There’s
seven or eight stations on our trunk line.
When you want to send a tellygram, you
take it in to a station which is most likely
a store. Perhaps somebody else will be gig-
ging along the line, so your wire has to be
hung up on the tellyphone. _ It’s the same
if, say, you were sending a wire to me. The
operator at the end of a trunk would talk
it over the tellyphone up to our store, and
the storekeeper would holler it back to him
so’s the township wouldn’t miss anything.
After that, it’d be hung up on a rail or
dropped on the floor, waiting for somebody
to call for it. There’s mostly hobnail boot-
marks on our tellygrams.
“I’m not going much on the conference.
Most of them seems to be just opening their
heads, and letting the wind blow their
tongues about. Still, we’ve all got them set
about the freehold. Nobody can kid us with
their perpetual leasehold. Lu Triffles, the
Minister for Agriculture, comes round with
his tongue in his cheek. He starts chippin’
about his department. Terrible handi-
capped, he says, because there’s one officer
working here, and another officer working
in some other place. ‘And the worst of it
is,’ he says, ‘we are paying rent for these
offices.’ Upsets Patten, our boss-cocky. ‘Oh,
payin’ rent is good for you,’ says ’e. ‘Keep
on doing it in perpetuity,’ ’e says, ‘and it’s
surprisin’ how you’ll come to like it.’ He’s
a hard seed.
“Not that there’s much straight-out rent-
ing in the wheat country. The share system
has choused the other clean off the premises.
It’s a fairer go, too. Say you’re the land-
lord, and I’m the share cocky. You throw
in the land, the seed and the fertiliser; I
chucks in the labor and the working plant.
Of course, there are a few extras either way.
F’rinstance, you supply the bluestone for
‘pickling.’ We whack.the harvest, whatever
it is, grain or hay. Mostly we put up half
the wheat bags each, and the boss cocky is
supposed to provide shareman’s quarters and
a horse paddock, with water for the stock.
“It pans out just about middling for the
share cocky if things are middling. If he s
a goer he can bung in 300 acres easy. Sup-
posing it’s a 10-bushel harvest; that means
eight bushels for the share cocky, or 275. an
acre. So his little cheque’ll be £405. Ot
course, that isn’t all bunce. There’s chan
for the working stock, and there’s a few
chips taken off the plant. Still, a man can
make a pretty good start on not much capi-
tal ; and if a bad season hits him, it only
hits him for his labor and his horse feed.
“If the Government wants to do a bit foi
us hayseeds, it might find out what’s the
matter with wheat sacks. We’ve been pay-
ing 7d. and Sd. apiece for the little three-
bushel Chapmans. You just sit down and
figure it out, and vou’ll find the cocky is
paying about Is. 3d. in the £ for the mere
envelope to wrap his harvest in. I know plenty
of men, ‘hard doers,’ whose bag bill last year
was 3s. 6d. an acre —just about as much as
they’d be expected to pay a fatted landlord
if they had one. Somebody wants to say
something about this _ robbery. At present
we’re not dead certain who the thief is.
Here is a job for Lu Triffles.
“I still hear ’em telling the pale young
man at the typewriter to go on the land.
They seem to reckon he can go on the land
with a hoe and a wheelbarrer. It ain’t
so easy. If a young bloke wants to make a
decent living out of wheat, he’s got to bring
in not far short of 250 acres. He can’t do
that with a hoe and a barrer. He’ll want
a plough, harrows, cultivator and drill to get
the crop in, and he’ll want a harvester to
get it off. These will run him into close up
£3OO. And they won’t shift themselves.
He’ll come a mucker if he starts in on stiff
land with less than seven horses, and when
he’s bought their harness, they’ll run him
into close up another £3OO. By that time
he’ll be finding that he wants a dray, most
likely a waggon, and when they talk waggons
they mean anything from £75 to £lO5, and
don’t blush about it. It’s very good to tell
the young ribbon salesman to go out and
be a hardy yeoman, but. unless the young
man has a father that the bank manager
is polite to, they might almost as well tell
him to be a fried egg.
“But it’s all right when you can get
going. There’s not the profit in many things
that there is in a good season. It’s hard
tack, but we’re getting into the way of
mixing it with other things, and there’s
plenty we talk about besides wheat and the
price of corn sacks. When she got me fairly
on the string, Sarah comes up to me and
says, ‘Dad, didn’t yer give that yearling
Jersey heifer to me?’ As like as not I did,
so I couldn’t argue with her. A few days
later she says, ‘Dad, I sold the heifer. Cousin
offered £4 for her, but I said five. Then we
agreed to split the difference, as long as he
made it £4 17s. 6d.’ That’s why I’m hang-
ing around here. Sarah reckoned she could
do 20 grand ooeras on the money, and if
you looked somewheres in the e-allery you’d
find her, with a packet of sandwitches in one
pocket, and what’s left of Molly’s heifer in
the other. Terrible fond”—

Sunday.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I WONDER what devil invented Sun-
day? Now I come to think of it, it
wasn’t a devil, but no matter. Any-
way, I’d like to tell him what I think of it!
Sunday’s the hardest day in my week, and
I’m tired for six days after it. I’d like to
meet a week that hadn’t any Saturdays,
Sundays or Mondays in it. I’m always
sleepier on Sunday morning than any other
morning; so is everyone else. It’s almost
as hard to get the rest of the family up as
it is to get a new dress. I don’t know about
my temper, but I do know about the tempers
of the rest of the family—my word, I do.
Before breakfast is over the mailman
comes with the weekly mail. Everyone
fights for letters and papers, and the house
begins to look as if a paper-chase had been
held in it. I skim hurriedly through my
letters while Himself keeps up a running
commentary :
“Um —wool’s down! Got the returns of
those weaners. Struck a beastly bad mar-
ket. Where’s Friday’s paper? Dash my
skin, where have my glasses gone? I wish
someone wouldn’t put papers over every-
thing.”
He goes and plumps into a verandah chair
while I tidy letters away and screw up
papers in a frenzy. There’s the house to
tidy, the dinner to cook, quite a million
little things to see to, and only a few hours
to do them in. I want four hands and 120
minutes in each hour on Sundays.
Whilst I am hurling the beds into day
attire and banging brooms a voice calls out
from the verandah. I have been well
brought up, so I fly out and snap:—
“What d’you want?”
An injured smoky voice answers: “No-
thing. I only called out to say the King has
had toothache.” I don’t say anything, but
I aim a kick at the cat. However, the cat
has learnt that Sunday morning is no time
for foolery, and leaps hurriedly.
As I am scurrying to put the bread in
tins I feverishly wonder what pudding I can
make with no butter and one egg. Then the
voice comes :
“What’s the date?”
“Don’t know,” in a frayed manner.
“Why the devil don’t you? Bless my
soul, anyone ought to know the date. This
ink’s nearly dry—just fill it, will you? I’m
busy! Who’s been tidying this table. My
block’s gone. Oh, here it is. Wish you’d
leave things alone.”
I feel I want to hurt something, so I slam
the butter between the pats and scrunch it.
“The mailman’ll be along soon. My let-
ter’s not written, and I can’t find that
cheque of Brown’s to send to the bank.
Where the blazes is the cheque?” So the
voice bawls with a jerk.
“It’s on the file,” I bawl, also with a jerk.
“Damn it, why didn’t you leave it where
I’d put it in the drawer,” he yells, and a
drawer shuts violently. I am too tired to
say that I found it stuffed in the pocket of
the trousers that were put out to be washed.
Just as I am making the inevitable bread
and butter pudding Himself demands string.
Then I have to keep my thumb on the string
while he ties it, and, of course, I move my
thumb, and there is an explosion.
He has a long conversation with the mail-

Colic, Diarrhoea, and Dysentery
Are diseases that require immediate attention. In almost every neighbourhood
someone has died from these diseases before medicine could be procured or a
physician summoned.
Those who rely upon physicians often find that they are away from home when
most needed.
Every family, and especially those who reside in the back blocks, should keep
at hand a bottle of Chamberlain’s Colic & Diarrhoea Remedy.
No physician can prescribe a better medicine for the purpose for which it is
intended. It is invaluable for both children and adults.

man. Then he comes back for morning tea.
Why hasn’t a morning more hours? He
drinks his tea at leisure, but Igo about
doing odds and ends, and carry the cup with
me and gulp at intervals. Oh, the odds and
ends that eat up so much time!
Then I put the bluish leg of mutton in the
tin with islands of fat, and shut it up to
sizzle and roast. And I wish it was the
universe I was cooking.
We’re expecting people in the afternoon.
Himself likes people, lie says they make a
break. They do! I slap up scones for the
sacrificial feast, and, in between basting the
spluttering leg, try to make our one living
room look less sordid. I ram purple petunias
and mignonette into the vases, and put the
shabbiest things in the darkest corners.. The
world wouldn’t be such a bad place if. we
didn’t have to put a good face on things
until the face becomes a fixed and ghastly
grin.
Dinner time finds me hot and tired, with
the red of the fire and the heat of a simmer-
ing temper in my cheeks. "Himself nas a
good appetite. It never balks nor shies, but
takes its fences flying. It can take one
variety of meat and three vegetables in its
stride. He can’t understand why I don’t
wolf greedily, too, after spending a morning
rushing about in a heated kitchen full of
smells. Then he takes his third cup of tea
out on to the verandah that he may drink it
leisurely.
Lightning is a snail to me on Sunday
afternoons. The plates are stacked half-
dried. The kitchen is hurled into a sort of
tidiness. I rush off to my room to wash off
the surface dirt. When lam scrabbling up
my hair Himself bawls out that the Browns
are coming. My heart goes down to the
bowels of the earth, but my fingers run
races.
I manage to meet the Browns on the ver-
andah with a stiff, tired smile. lam vilely
conscious of a hastilv-flunv on, awry dress,
and hands still red from abluting. We say
it’s hot or it’s cold, and how’s Billy and
Tommy and father, and everything Brown
that grows. Oh, these Sundays, for there’s
nothing ever to talk about, and one gets
tired of inventing lies about one’s neighbors!
I’m almost glad when it’s time to get
afternoon tea, because I can say “damn” in
the kitchen, and only the cats can hear, and
they’re used to it. I grin at the little
Browns, and give them weak tea to spill in
their saucers and cake to drop on the floor,
and I say how sweet they are, and pray for
bed.
By the time my head is splitting and I’m
on the rim of hysterics they go, and it seems
to me that most of me goes, too. As lam
gathering up the fragments of the feast,
Himself comes in to say that Smith is
coming!
I say it’s hot or it’s cold over again to
Smith, and how are his sheep and his grass
and any other Smiths. Then I feed the
fowls, and throw some water over the few
struggling plants. Then I get tea. Then
I wash up!
While Smith and Himself smoke and talk
on the verandah I try to look at the paper,
but I’m too tired to take it in. No wonder
women haven’t much “grasp.” Later on,
Smith comes in, and I try to talk while Him-
self has brief and spasmodic slumbers.
“Have you been to town lately?” I ask
Smith.
“Not lately,” he says.
Pause.
“Are you going into the Show?”
“I don’t think so.”
Pause.
“Did you see about that railway acci-
dent?”
“Noticed somethin’ about it?”
Pause.
Himself having an interval of wakeful-
ness.
“Has Downs struck water yet?”
“Not yet. He expects to in another 20ft.”
Pause.
Nearly desperate, I get supper.
Then at last Smith goes— goes —he goes.
Himself yawns loudly and goes off to bed.
I clean up. wash everything, set the table for
the morning (’cause it’s Monday), skim
pans, fill up kettles, wind clocks, sort out
clothes for the first copper. Then I also go
to bed.
And that ends Sunday. Washing day

The Tale of ’Enery.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THIS story, supplied by “Mossy Camp-
bell,” is so touching in its ill-spelled
and unpunctuated beauty that it is
shoved right in :
Mr. “Enery” Bingham, “pushite,” factory worker,
walked down the old familiar alley for the first
time in six months, to tell the truth “Enery” had
been “High and Dry” for that enforced, period at
the expense «f an impartial goverment. he chanced

The Freetrade Rabbit Pie.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It (Australia) has endeavored to put down sweat-
ing and long hours and poor pay and black and yel-
low labor on its own premises, while keeping the
door open, or at least more than half open, to the

sins that the Australian manufacturer isn’t allowed
to practise.— Bulletin (6/6/’l2).

“It was here that I give up me Freetrade
fer good ;
An’ I set about riggin’ a fence—
Jest a sort o’ low tariff of barbwire en’ wood.
(I admits I was long gettin’ sense.)
‘Now this,’ reckons I, ‘will keep most of ’em
out,
While ut lets just a few of ’em in!’
You will note, all along, I ’ave not the Past
doubt,
I was keen upon savin’ me tin.
“But I’d come to icknowledge that breedin’
the pests
Was a false an’ mistaken idear;
So I poisons me own, an’ I digs out the
nests
Till I got me place pretty well clear.
But me chock-an’-log fence was a sight fer
sore eyes!
It was far frum Pertection, I owns;
Fer I still hugged the notion, of eatin’ cheap
pies
That was bred be McPherson an’ Jones.
“An’ them rabbits was cheap —you might
think I was dense,
But I couldn’t deny they was cheap.
So still they come in through the gaps in
the fence,
An’ took ’alf o’ the grass from me sheep.. ..
Then sudden, one mornin’, it struck roe —
fair whack !
An’ I seen ut as plain as could be:
Wot about all the grass that them rabbits
took back
To McPherson an ’ Jone% an ’ McGee?
“There was Sanderson’s rabbits consumin’
the feed
That belonged to me bullicks an’ sheep!
An’ here was me helpin’ ’em ! Thinkin’ I’d
need
Of a bunny or two on the cheap !. ...
I was solid Pertection in less than a week,
An’ me nettin’ was up in quick time;
An’ now, you will notice, me bullicks is
sleek,
An’ me mutton, I tell yeh, is prime.
“So you take ut frum me.... (Woah there,
Ginger, yeh c0w!)”....
Ses old Cullen, the cockie, ses he:
“I’m a certain an’ solid Pertectionist now,
Fer I’m sick of the bunny that’s free.
‘Low Tariff’ is lettin’ in rabbits to eat
The grass that you want fer yer sheep,
An’ doin’ in chances of raisin’ good meat
In the hope of a pie on the cheap.
“An’ if these politicians ’as got any sense —
(An’ I’ve ’eard as there’s some with a
head)
They will give over patchin’ their chock-an’-
log fence,
An’ put up new nettin’ instead.
Fer I’ve found that the nettin’s the sensible
way,
An’ I’m happy an’ prosperous now,”
Ses Cullen the cockie, he ses to me. “Hey!
Git on with yeh, Ginger, yeh cow!”

makes the following claims upon your attention :
1 — It uses cheap lamp oil (such as kerosene), and other residuals.
2 The oil is injected directly into the cylinder, thus dispensing with unre-
liable and inefficient vaporisers.
5 is very simple in construction, there being no electric ignilion or other
complicated mechanism.
4 Its speeds are such that electric generators and centrifugal pumps may
be coupled direct.
5 No skilled labor is required, the supply of fuel and lubricant being all
the attention necessary.
