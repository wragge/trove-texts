WAY OF ADELAIDE
Though it has long been the custom
in England for lawyers to write their
reminiscences, and has resulted in
many fascinating books, Australian
legal men rarely do so, still less attempt
a biography as A. J. Hannan, Q.C.,
has done in The Life of Chief Justice
Way (Angus and Robertson); and for
that reason alone this book should be
welcome.
Hannan's difficulty in it is that Way
was a great and good man; and if a
great man is an admirable, indeed a
compulsory subject for a biography, a
good man is very hard to write about.
Born at Portsmouth in 1836, in
poverty-stricken if not precisely humble
circumstances as the son of a minister
of the Bible Christians (a small
Methodist sect), Way emigrated to
South Australia at 16. He started as
junior clerk in a lawyer’s office, swam
daily and exercised with the dumb-
bells to keep himself fit, qualified for
practice as a lawyer within five years
and, partly as the result of his ability
and ceaseless industry, partly through
his principal's death, which enabled
him to purchase the practice, soon be-
came a leader of the bar in Adelaide.
He was made a Q.C.; entered Parlia-
ment and became Attorney-General;
usefully appointed himself Chief
Justice (which Hannan says was
sensible of him); was appointed
Lieutenant-Governor; and finally, after
a most fierce battle with the partisans
of Sir William Windeyer in Sydney,
a rival for the post, was appointed
Australian representative on the
Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council.
All his life he remained loyal to the
Bible Christians. All his life he was
engaged in the most useful public
activities—chancellor of the University
of Adelaide, a founder of the Adelaide
Children’s Hospital, a pioneer breeder
of Shropshires, a promoter of the
Adelaide Zoo. He married, for the
first and only time, on his 62nd birth-
day; and he said in old age that the
one branch of literature in which he
would have liked to succeed, had he
taken it up as a career, was the writing
of hymns.
What on earth was Hannan to do—-
to make a sizeable, readable biography
—of so exemplary a character?
There is, in fact, quite a lot that
can be done in such circumstances.
Dr. Johnson was also (more or less)
an exemplary character, and look what
Boswell did with him.
It cannot be said that Hannan fixes
steadily upon Way so remorseless and
ironic an eye as Boswell kept upon
Johnson; which is by no means incom-
patible with respect and which is the
best way to bring the subject of a
biography to life. But you do get
glimpses, both amusing and majestic.
There is, for instance, the very
human touch when, on returning to
England for a holiday. Way called
incognito on his relatives and got them
—not recognising him—to talk about
him. There is his rapture at the opera
in London and his curious visit to a
music hall “to see how that kind of
business is done.” There is the
interesting change in his outlook when
the young lawyer who did not wish to
be “transported for life” developed
into the South Australian patriot very
indignant with English politicians who
were not sufficiently interested in Aus-
tralian affairs.
There is the fact that the students
at Adelaide University found him
“garrulous and pompous.” There is
his asperity with counsel pleading be-
fore him, and even with brother judges,
when age made him increasingly
irascible and absent-minded. There is
the scene with the Secretary of State,
Lord Knutsford, when, in the full tide
of Way’s dignity, he called on him to
get more knighthoods for South Aus-
tralians—Way considered his reception
was
....much more frigid than I
received from many much more dis-
tinguished men. At the very begin-
ning of our official interview I
placed him quite in the wrong. He
began by stating that our interview
must be short. I said, “I quite
understand how your Lordship's
time is engaged. It is my duty to
pay my respects to you, and, having
done so, there is no reason why I
should detain you further, and I
have the honour of wishing you good
morning.” He was profuse in
apologies and told me many confi-
dential matters, and I did not get
away until the third time I rose to
take my departure.
Apart from such glimpses of per-
sonality, there are other special points
of interest which can always be
expected to enliven a legal biography.
There are, for instance, the fees; which
Hannan certainly discusses with proper
relish. There are the cases in .which
Way was involved; and if he seems to
have been confronted with rather a
dull (though sometimes legally import-
ant) lot of cases—or if Hannan does
not dwell sufficiently on this aspect of
his subject—once again there are lively
moments. However one passes-over his
first case about a horse, his more
important battle about the Moonta
coppermine, and even the famous
Corset Case when such painful allega-
tions of fraud were made against
prominent Adelaide citizens, for the
royal commission of 1883 which dis-
covered such appalling facts about the
reformatory-hulk in which boys were
imprisoned at Largs Bay and the
almost equally distressing facts about
the Lying-in Home for unmarried
mothers on North Terrace.
On our first visit to the hulk we
were struck with the pallid and dull
appearance of the boys. This we
attribute to the depressing conditions
and wearisome monotony of the life
on board, and largely to defects in
the dietary and want of open-air
exercise. There are no masts and rig-
ging to serve for means of physical
training. As the hulk is roofed-in,
forward, the poop is the only place
where the boys can get the light and
sun necessary for health. From
January, 1882, to the end of 1883,
the boys’ going on shore seems to
have been stopped altogether, except
at intervals of six or seven months.
When, at our request, Dr. Toll and
Dr. Clindening visited the ship,
thirty of the boys did not touch the
meat, and most of these took only
part of the cold and indigestible
pudding served out to them.
Finally, a legal biography can be
enlivened by anecdotes of other legal
men, politicians, etc., who came into
contact with the subject; and here
Hannan has some truly remarkable
characters to bring forward and some
notable battles to relate; Sir John
Jeffcott, South Australia’s first judge,
who had killed a man in a duel and
lay under a charge of murder which
was never brought to court; the excit-
able Judge Boothby who believed that

After experimentation with other types of piping,
experienced land men invariably come to one
conclusion ■ — there’s no really satisfactory sub-
stitute for Steel Pipe.
Steel Pipe, for instance, is not susceptible to
damage by stock, fire, rodents or termites and
can, therefore, be laid above ground saving
trenching costs.
In addition it has greater strength, longer life,
and can stand greater pressures. Steel Pipe is
easy to handle or store without fear of breakage,
and is adaptable to innumerable uses.
Why take risks with other fragile, easily damaged,
shorter-lived types of piping!

INDUSTRIAL PEACE
/~\NE of the most heartening develop-
ments for industry and one of the
most disheartening for the Com-
munists and careerists of the Australian
Labor Party and union agitation-bodies
is to be found in the report of the
Commonwealth Department of Labor
for 1959.
That year was an all-time record for
industrial peace since 1933 in terms of
absolute figures an easy all-time
record, having regard to population
and the strength of the work-force.
There has been a steady drop over
most of the last decade in the loss of
man-days through industrial disputes.
Over that period the average yearly
loss has been slightly over two hours
and 40 minutes per worker, and last
year the figure was only one hour pet
worker. The year’s figure was not much
more than a sixth of the average for the
19405; and over what it was in the
decade before that, or in the 19205, it
is better to draw a veil.
If the coalmining and stevedoring
industries were left out the remaining
industries would have chalked-up only
40 minutes’ loss of time per worker last
year. When it is reckoned that these
employ only about 45,000 people
against a background of a total
unionised work-force of about two-
millions—plus, of course, a large num-
ber of employed who are not members
of unions—it seems fairly easy to
pinpoint the conditions under which
industrial strife continues.
These two industries, both well-paid,
well-organised and providing rewards
and conditions far above those pres-
cribed by the actual law, are still the
centres of most dissent, an excrescence
on the smooth surface of industrial
peace.
Even they, of course, are not living
up to their shocking records in the
past. Last year their losses were only
half those of 1957, itself a record low
year. But their leaders are still the
most militant in Australia.
In N. S. Wales, which employs
about 13,000 men out of the 20,000 in
the black-coal industry in the Com-
monwealth, the man-day loss last year
represented 90 per cent, of the whole of
that of the black-coal industry of the
Commonwealth.
Queensland and New South Wales
accounted for two-thirds of the loss of
man-days among the 26,000 employees
in the stevedoring industry.
Next to coal and stevedoring the
engineering and metal industries were
the worst offenders —25 per cent, of the
total time lost, with the food, drink
and tobacco industries next with 15
per cent.
TT is remarkable how, come rise or
A fall in idleness through strife and for
other causes, the order of disorderliness
persists among particular groups.
The overall figures do not tell the
true story of the peacefulness of
industry as a whole, because in every
branch of employment the large con-
tinuous stoppages all are achieved —
and that is the right word —in unions
which have Communist control or
Communist leaders.
The two small industries—in man-
power—of coal and wharf labor are
notorious for Communist domination
or control over them. And their leaders
are continuously engaged in making as
much strife as possible.
Some metalworkers and transport
unions are in the same position, but to
a lesser degree.
The strikes and stoppages which
take place in them are linked in pur-
pose and under the same plan of dis-
ruption of the economy and of defence
through hampering steel production and
major transport and fuel production,
which are tied-up with heavy industry.
The hotel and food industry has a
large Communist ingredient in its
leadership. And unfortunately the
A.C.T.U., with which the N.S.W.
public servants have now agreed to
affiliate, is also a happy hunting-ground
for these Moscow agents who never
tire in the promotion of dissatisfaction
and trouble for the employers and in
promotion of their own revolutionary
aims.
The days are gone, of course, when
seven of a Labor Prime Minister’s
war-time Trade Union Advisory Com-
mittee were Communists. Those were
the roaring days when a deliberate
policy produced chaos in the coal
industry—days during which E. J.
Ward was prepared to allow the wholly
Communist-controlled Miners’ Federa-
tion to run the industry to its own
satisfaction. But Communist influence
in Labor politics is still strong and
strengthening.
As J. M. Riordan, general secretary
of the Federated Clerks’ Union of
Australia, wrote recently in an Ameri-
can union journal, the “political wing
is, generally speaking, careful to mirror
the industrial wing,” being “careful to
the decisions of the industrial
movement.”
Mr. Riordan declared that “the Com-
munists significantly have concentrated
their strength in unions covering indus-
tries which have economic importance
—where a strike is capable of having
its effect on national economic policy.
Federally they control the unions cover-
ing the dockers, the seamen, the railway
workers, a large number of the heavy-
industry and mechanical-engineering
workers, many building - industry
workers and coalminers.”
He wrote that their strength in the
A.C.T.U. was such that they “were not
unhappy with any decision reached at
the September congress of the A.C.T.U.
and were delighted with the vast
majority of them.” They are now in
a position in which they themselves
are in growing strength in the A.C.T.U.
congresses and virtually in control in
conjunction with their underground
and fellow-traveller memberships.
HTHEY are at present capitalising the
A disorder of the Labor party follow-
ing the appearance of Dr. Evatt’s
sectarian red-herring to cover-up the
implications of the Petrov affair, and
are the only stable political force in
the Labor movement.
They are benefiting by the emergence
of the same sort of strong Left-wing
that wrecked Labor in the days of Lang
and Scullin, with some State branches
of the A.L.P. giving their acquiescence
to unity tickets and such-like devices
and to Red infiltration of political
branches of the party.
To quote Riordan again:—
Because of the political situation which
flows from [the A.L.P. split of 1954-6]
and the emergence of strong Left-wing
—Communist in certain States—forces
in the Labor party, there are, unfortu-
nately some, who for a variety of rea-
sons, think it politically unwise and
unfashionable to be strongly anti-Com-
munist.
If Labor is not careful this wave of
rising Red influence will drown its
organisation or leave it marooned on
the Communist raft, since the rank-
and-file, with increasing prosperity and
improving general education, is drifting
rapidly away from the Communist
ideals of revolution and becoming
every day more inimical to the Com-
munist policy of bringing capitalist
countries to economic wreck in the
interests of Moscow policy. The capi-
talist type of economy is becoming so
good to the workers that thousands of
them are still voting Labor only be-
cause they are punch-drunk from years
of A.L.P. earbashing.


FISK OR PEDESTRIAN?
[“Six weeks of negotiations by 88 nations collapsed last week when rival coastal-limit plans failed to get the
two-thirds majority at the Law-of-the-Sea Conference.”]
“Unless they make-up their minds pretty soon I’ll be starting to grow feet and toes!”


PLAIN ENGLISH
Coral Sea Reflections
Coral Sea Week has come round once
more with its welcome and courteous
incursions of United States high officers
and new ships showing the flag and
commemorating the significance of the
Coral Sea battle.
This year Admiral Hopwood, Com-
mander-in-Chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet
with headquarters at Pearl Harbor, is
the principal American guest, and the
atomic submarine Halibut, the largest
afloat and armed with the Regulus missile,
the piece de resistance.
The Coral Sea battle is historic in that
it was the first engagement of magnitude
fought at sea between contending fleets
at a distance through the use of air-
power. But it has already receded into
the background of the history of naval
progress.
When it took place the prophets were
certain that it marked the end of security
for Australia, since fleets could now place
themselves out of range of radar off
Sydney Heads and destroy the city with
their aircraft.
Today virtually nothing is out of
range of aircraft or sounding-devices or
radar. And the atomic submarines armed
with Regulus missiles (which are only
intermediates) are in process of being
superseded by bigger and better ones
with Polaris missiles which may presently
—but not yet—be able on the surfacg
to hit a target from 1500 miles away
with an H-bomb warhead, and from a
lesser distance submerged.
Already it is being suggested that
these new battleships of the deeps may be
the weapon to end all war. But, like
gas, all they may be is weapons to end
themselves.
If they are not now fully detectable at
long range it is only a step before they
will be. Radar and detection methods
have made just as great strides as
weaponry —the other day, within a very
few flying-hours, British nuclear bombers
mapped the whole of the coastline of
the Mediterranean Sea with sharp detail
and under all atmospheric conditions,
from great height; and to electronic-
detectors of modern kind a 6000-ton
submarine with an atomic plant is a
very detectable object.
The human race is naturally warlike.
When it has no other way to fight it
fights with what it has to hand, and no
mere thought of destruction will deter
it, because it is always buoyed with the
hope that it can be more destructive
than the other fellow.
A post-war survey of w.hat happened
to France on the Somme and Verdun
deterred neither the Germans nor the
French from developing a yearning to
have another knock at each other after
World War I, and it will not deter them
again, Moreover, the maintenance of
conventional forces is warrant that no-
body in authority believes in the shibbo-
leth that any war can be ended with a
few atomic bombs.
The Russian victory on the eastern
front in World War II and the Korean
affair taught that expendable manpower
is still the world’s greatest and final
weapon in war, great or small. And the
time is perhaps not very far off when the
realisation of this will be general.
Perhaps it is already general sub-
consciously in Moscow, and perhaps this
has something to do with the softening
attitude of the Kremlin (if there is any
softening) towards capitalism and the
West.
It may have dawned on Khrushchev
that in placing Communism on the throne
in Peking, the Kremlin has created a
Frankenstein monster and that Mao’s
aspiration for 25-million trained men
expressed some years ago has objectives
beyond those of taking-over southern
Moscow itself, with places West, might,
as of long ago, be on the Chinese
itinerary. And Russia and the United
States, now- the world’s deadliest com-
petitors in advancing the art of war,
might soon be giving each other bases
for mutual protection.
S. Africa and Commonwealth
Whatever else happens about South
Africa, it would be a world disaster (as
Mr. Howard Green, Canadian Minister
for External Affairs remarked in a debate)
if the Union were cast- or driven-out of
the British Commonwealth. It would be
doubly difficult if the Commonwealth
broke over the color question, which has
become one of the ugliest weapons of
Communism. The technique of rising to
power on the misfortunes of backward
people has been cultivated to the limit
by Moscow.
There are few people outside South
Africa who do not disapprove of South
African policies, though most of the
horror is being voiced by some who care
least for native welfare apd everything
for the uses to which the situation may
be put.
If South Africa were totally Boer, or
even if the majority of its white electors
could be guaranteed to be permanently
on the side of the present Government,
it would be a different matter. The
Afrikaans people could settle their own
differences with the Bantu.
There is, however, a very large non-
Dutch population, the greater propor-
tion of it British in blood and much of it
settled for four or five generations in
the Cape and Natal area. There is a
huge amount of British capital invested
there. Both the British and the British
capital would be marooned after a break.
There are strategic ports and South
African defence to be considered. And
there is a tradition of sentiment in favor
of the U.K. which must always survive
among South Africans, despite the Boer
wars ; a sentiment born of the common
sufferings of colonists in a Larsh and
dangerous land and of common effort in
war.
Australians who know their history of
World War I are unlikely to forget that
the agonies of the A.I.F. at Pozieres,
Flers and in the surrounding country
in the battles of the Somme were matched
by those of the South Africans at Del-
ville Wood —Delville Wood, which
formed one of the flanks of the Aus-
tralian Corps after the summer battles
of 1916, and which is now a hallowed
memorial to the South African dead,
legally part of the Union of South Africa.
It has been made plain by Mr. Louw,
who represents the South African Union
at the Prime Ministers’ Conference in
London, that even if the vote at the
referendum for a republic breaks the
connection of the Union with the British
Crown, the South African Republic will
be anxious to stay in the British Common-
wealth. It would be fodder for a lunatic
asylum if it did not, since it has nowhere
else to go for alliance or even relation-
ships. It would be flung straight into the
hands of native fanatics if it were driven
into isolation.
Those who know South Africa are
inclined to think that time and patience
will bring a solution of the present prob-
lem, perhaps sooner than expected.
Many of the shouts of horror are coming
from people who fail to remember that
it is only a generation since what is called
apartheid in the Union was generally
practised by all colonising nations. Even
today India, whose voice is hoarse
with indignation, is having great difficulty
in abolishing the old caste systems which
originally were racially based, no doubt,
and which declared a large part of the
population “untouchable,” or low-caste
and tainted.
Vale "Red Robbie"
Few of the thousands of soldiers who
knew him could have told you his
Christian-name, and they would have
scouted the idea that it could be Horace.
To the troops, to his friends and to his
enemies Lieutenant-General Sir Horace
Clement Hugh Robertson was always
“Red Robbie.”
He was a fighting-man with all the
attributes of the redheaded. When there
was an enemy he fought him and made
everybody in his vicinity fight both the
foe and himself. When there was no
enemy he fought anybody who was
available.
Born in October, 1894, he went from
Geelong College to Duntroon, and from
Duntroon very hurriedly to the 10th
A.L.H., which he accompanied to Gal-
lipoli and thence to Sinai and Palestine
He led the 10th Light Horse in their
historic charge at Magdhaba in
1916, and by the time he was 23 he had
been mentioned twice in dispatches and
had won the D.S.O.
After the war he came back to Staff
Corps duty, became Duntroon’s Director
of Military Art, making the Course
almost as eventful as a minor campaign
in Africa.
He emerged as the first Commandant
of the Seventh Military District (Dar-
win), and in World War II ran the whole
gamut of promotion from Brigadier of
the 19th Infantry Brigade in the Sixth


Division in Libya to commander-in-chief
of the First Australian Army Northern
New Guinea, where he accepted the
surrender of the Japanese, whom he
paralysed with the piercing stare of his
monocle.
In Japan in 1946 he succeeded Sir
John Northcott in command of the
British Commonwealth Occupation
Force where, for five years, he followed
his life-long habits of combat with every-
body in view—he had had at least one
memorable engagement with Blarney.
Always a soldiers’ general, his troops
in the Occupation Area were among the
smartest in the world, and the Japanese
were more subdued within his jurisdic-
tion than elsewhere, for he made it quite
clear to them all that they were a con-
quered people who must conform to
his views of deportment and reform.
He was Administrative C.-in-C. of the
British Commonwealth Forces in Korea
1950-51.
Retiring into civilian life after his final
military service as G.O.C. Southern
Command in 1953-54, he became a com-
missioner of the Victorian State Savings
Bank.
Whatever his faults, and however hard
he was sometimes to live with, he was
a fine soldier, a fine leader and trainer
of men and a fearless propagandist
whenever he had a purpose to serve.
Only on April 25 last he was in Bris-
bane, where he told the Queenslanders
that their way of celebrating Anzac Day
could be an “unhealthy growth” in
democracy ; that thb all-day celebration
had something morbid about it, and
that the Queenslanders were out of step
with the rest of Australia in their method
of observing the day.
Three days afterwards, on his return
to Melbourne, he was taken to Heidel-
berg Hospital and died suddenly at the
early age of 65. His is one of the names
that is already a legend in the annals of
the two Australian Imperial Forces.
What's Impairment?
[From ‘Collins Street”J
If the Victorian Liberal and Country
party accepts the latest inroad on civil
liberty proposed by Cabinet, and a bill
is passed permitting a new charge of
driving while impaired by alcohol, it
will, no doubt, lead to some changes in
Parliament House itself.
It may even lead to the closure of
the bar, robbing Parliament of much of
its legislative spirit, since it seems to be
generally accepted in forensic medicine
that one drink impairs some persons’
driving, and there is no reason to presume
that Parliamentarians are more hardened
drinkers than other sections of the com-
munity ; some, indeed, in my experience,
have been visibly affected in the
apparently less dangerous business of
guiding legislation.
The Cabinet also proposes to get party
approval for the use of road-blocks, to
authorise the use of breathalysers, to
remove the keys from cars the police
consider may be driven by persons
affected by drink, to employ more police
and to undertake a full-scale education
campaign.
There is no evidence to suggest that
this Cabinet, and in particular this
Minister, Arthur Rylah, Chief Secretary
and Attorney-General, are less under the
thumb of triumphant bureaucracy, as
Professor Bland phrases it, than other
Governments.
At what stage a person’s driving be-
comes impaired and at what moment it
passes from impairment to “not under
proper control” (that is, in fact, drunken
driving) can hardly be defined.
It will be left to magistrates to decide.
It cannot be claimed that the decisions
of magistrates are completely satisfactory
or at all uniform ; and impairment is a
hairline issue on which to reach a de-
cision that can gravely affect a citizen.
It would be a criminal, not a traffic,
offence, and the Liberal Parliamentarians
would be wise to throw it out.
Road-blocks which have been experi-
mented with in Melbourne suburbs have
proved to be extremely irritating to large
numbers of drivers; breathalysers,
although their use will be voluntary, can
be negatived by the use of coffee-beans
or similar aromatic stuffs; and the seizure
of car-keys could be justified only if the
zeal and integrity of the police had never
been in question.
Sea-dogs in the Manger
Seamen who have been taking the law
into their own hands by invading a
shipping company’s office in Melbourne,
wrecking furniture and property, demon-
strating in other ports and holding the
Arbitration Commission up to ridicule,
claim to have been unjustly treated by
Mr. Justice Foster, who ordered a reduc-
tion in their penalty-rates for weekend
work. In granting a new award on
February 1 the judge provided for in-
creased rates of ordinary pay and various
other worthwhile benefits, but reduced
weekend-rates on the grounds that they
had become excessive.
Running true to the form experience
has taught must be expected from
Communist-controlled unions, the Sea-
men’s Union is prepared to take all the
improvements granted by the commis-
sion but cries blue-murder at the part of
the award that goes against it.
In publicity put out by the Seamen’s
Union the impression is given that sea-
men are being required to work for
2s. 2|d. an hour on Saturdays and 4s.
an hour on Sundays. What is not
explained to the public is that all men
working at weekends must be given a
day off during the week for every Satur-
day or Sunday worked. The effective rate
for Saturday work is thus 10s. lljd. an
hour and for Sundays 13s. l|d. an hour.
If equivalent time-off is not given within
a definite period and at a prescribed port,
additional penalty-rates are paid.
The riots and demonstrations were
sparked-off by the fine of £3OO imposed
on the union for disobeying a court
order not to strike. The real grievance
behind their behavior is that the new
award (and the penalties) make it
unprofitable for them to continue their
pleasant little game of having it both
ways. It was becoming almost standard
practice to hold irritation-strikes on week-
days and for the men to recoup them-
selves financially by weekend work at
high rates of pay—the weekend work
being forced upon shipowners in order
to catch-up on schedules disorganised by
week-day stoppages.
In the strangely colored vision of their
Red bosses it is tyranny to deprive them
of this privilege.
Command and Obey
One of the banners carried in the near-
riot by seamen in Melbourne read:
“Wharfies and Seamen Stand United.”
They do not. The wharfies were at
work, and there is some evidence that
they are bored with it all.
They may be forced into fresh out-
breaks in this Communist plot to create
as much 'industrial havoc as possible in
an effort to save the faces of the Com-
munists who lead the Victorian A.R.U.,
but experienced men on the Melbourne
wharves say there is not a watersider-
who would not like to work on Sundays.
The seamen’s quite indefensible be-
havior involved swarming, 500-strong,
through the offices of the Adelaide
Steamship Co., smashing telephones,
turning over desks, knocking over type-
writers, and demanding to see the chair-
man of the Australasian Steamship
Owners’ Federation, after they had
marched through the city.
They had ample time. They had just
embarked on a 48-hour stoppage which,
combined with the effects of the rain-
storm and the Anzac Day holiday, had
brought about the worst congestion in
shipping since the war, with 62 ships
without labor in Melbourne, not to men-
tion other capitals.
The men dressed in caricature of the
arbitration judges were in fact symbols
of the sort of tolerance in which we live,
but it was, nonetheless, a quite remark-
able demonstration, all in all, of the
power of the Communist official over the
emotional mob.
As an illustration of the torpor with
which Melbourne authorities view Com-
munist arrogance, not even an official
comment was made on the march until
the Press reported from Sydney the de-
scription of them by an Ironworkers’
delegate to the N.S.W. Labor Council as
“thugs and Chicago gangsters.”
Then Premier Bolte announced that he
had asked the Police Commissioner to
take “firm action to uphold the law
against this type of offence.” The sig-
nificance of this is that the police have
to be asked to “take firm action” against
mobs storming into offices and damaging
equipment. It is understandable only if
previous instructions had been given
to handle them gently, if at all, when
they were rampaging around city build-
ings.

pOWDERED glass in food will . not

How glad the wealthy F. B. Falkiners
would have been to know that!
Thirty years or so ago on their station,
Tuppal, you would have seen a remark-
able sight; their four children, 13 years
to 6, at 4 o’clock on a Sunday afternoon,
seated round the dining-room table eat-
ing large plates of oatmeal porridge.
They had earlier been allowed to make
toffee, which had been poured into a
big tin plate from which, when cold,
it was undetachable. There was heard a
great hammering ; small pieces of toffee
were brought to the grown-ups; the
children finished the rest. It was then
discovered that for a hammer they had
used a large cut-glass decanter-stopper,
and that all the sharp angles and edges
were ground off. Phone-call to doctor
13 miles away: he would come; mean-
time, “empty their stomach-contents.”
Nurse did this over a bath. Doctor
arriving, examined stopper and ' pre-
scribed thick porridge. The four scared
and possibly now-hungry children ate it
without a murmur. George, of Haddon
Rig, was 7 or 8 ; does he remember?—

“Lecteur”: Young men do strange
things in university cities at the begin-

student lathering and shaving another in
a crowded 9 o'clock rush-hour tram one
morning this year. Every time the tram
lurched we expected to see the standing
barber cut his seated, betowelled cus-
tomer’s throat. These actors only had
to snigger once and the spell would have
been broken, and they would have been
cast from the conveyance as public
nuisances. Their self-control was some-
thing to see. A hare-brained stunt, I
suppose, but it just shows what you can
get away with if you keep your head.

“Red Face” : Six-year-old son found

hour later son came back: “No, Daddy,
it didn’t fit the bank, but it fitted the

street from a construction project. The
foreman said she was repairing a friend’s
house, levelling a badly-holed veranda
and replacing old wooden steps with
concrete. Containing almost a ton of
material, though without a professional
finish, her job could out-live the house.

“Beam”: One minute the family were
all together looking at the model trains

about going to a policeman should he
get lost. And there he was. “They gave

“Brick E”: One of the questions in
the mid-term quiz at our technical col-

be built into brickwork with certain
features uppermost. To my amazement
the word “uppermost” mystified third-

stood up and asked for an explanation.
All looked relieved when it was given,
Marking the papers later I found the
correct answer had been given in all
cases ; but two of the embryo brickolo-
gists (as I once heard a student designate
himself) had worded the correct position
as “downermost.”

“D.”: The one-day strike in Sydney
by hotel employees revived those sad
post-war years when quenching a thirst
meant queues, lengthy waits and currying
the favor of barmaids. In the strike
many pubs closed because there was no
one to dispense the amber, but some
employees did defy the strike-order, and
the hostelries they staffed were rushed.
It was in one of these that I was having
a middy when a striker from another
pub ordered a schooner from the beer-
dispenser. \ When he had been served he
belligerently chided the lass for working.
Puffing out her ample statistics, she shot
at him, “Listen, brother, if it’s good
enough for you to bloody-well strike

damned-well good enough for me to keep
on serving! Got the message?” Evi-
dently he did: he melted into the mob.

“Dud”: “Wynbal’s” story (B. 30/3 / ’6O)
of the soldier hidden by the W.A.A.F.s
had a parallel in 1916 when the troop-
ship Suevic, loaded with troops, was
steaming down the N.S.W. coast ana a
stowaway was discovered on the mess-
deck. The C. 0., for the first time in his
military career, didn’t know what to do
with a person dressed in khaki and all
insignia and looking woebegone, because
she was a woman. Mona West will
always be remembered among men of
War I as the only woman to get
past the eagle-eyed M.P.s on the gang-
way. Put ashore in Melbourne, she was
also the omy woman to thrust the war
news from the front pages.

“Tabba”: “Sanasi’s” remarks (B.

Mackay woman with such a house so
cluttered underneath: “When my son
got married and built a house he put
it on low blocks because, he said, you
always tend to hoard rubbish under high-
blocked houses. Then when my daughter
married she and her husband said the
same thing and built a low house, too.”
The poor woman pointed to the bric-a-
brac under her house and added: “Now
they find they haven’t room for odds-
and-ends, so what do they do? Bring it
over and stuff it under Mum’s place;
that’s what!”

so he’s gone off to spend it. He never
works when he has any money.” Bill
is young, unmarried, owns a car and is
completely carefree. He and the car just
take-off to the other side of the State

that his job awaits him on his return —-
or another, if he cares to make a change.

“Hamish”: Calling at the travel-
agency on a busy Saturday morning, he
announced that he had come to pay
for a booking for travel to Sydney by
bus, and that his name was Murphy.
After a long search

calls the worried
clerk said that they
could find no trace
of the reservation;
to make sure, he'd
rebook it. This done,
Mr. Murphy paid-up
and left the office. In
a few minutes he was
back again. Strug-
gling through the
mob, he said to the
booking - clerk “Do
you know why you
couldn’t find that
booking of mine?
My name's Murphy-

one weekend people noticed four lads,
dressed as bodgies, driving a horse and

like phoning the police, but the lads
explained that the old chap was in bed
sick, and they were collecting »the bottles
for him. Their collection was a record
one, and not only did they sell the bottles
and give the money to the old chap, but
they looked after his horse while he was
sick.

mates claims that
peeled prawns sold

Chinese or Indian,
as peeling would
make the Sydney

eye on any oysters

fit their shells. Just

ideal breeding-place for the insects his

in which he breeds 50,000 tropical fish.
He rmvst be coining money ; my

there is plenty of demand for them from

“Ardoyne”: When my son’s old car

acquired a third of the same make that

had the required fittings changed over

the bargain-bomb would provide all the
spare-parts either of us was ever likely
to need. That was a month or so ago.
Now, the garage is so chock-a-block
you can hardly turn around in the place,
let alone drive a car into it; the back-
yard looks like a wrecker’s dump—and
there’s still a lot of bomb to be dis-
membered. I never realised before how
compactly a car is built. If anyone’s
got an aircraft-hangar he doesn’t want,
I’m in the market: I simply must have
space for those precious spares.

“A survey made by top Hollywood executives

Led-to-the-slaughter look so livid.
As well, it could
Strike Hollywood
(Where wedlock’s stresses get their

The tune must needs
Contain the seeds
Of future conjugal contentions.

The fire so hot
That fillum-moguls here are meaning.
Thespis is served
Best when it’s verved,
Not by a blaze, even a whopper,
But crackling fire
From gun for hire
As baddie shoots with sawn-off
chopper.
This babe whose cry
Brings tear to eye
By swaddling-clothes is never fettered ;
She weighs around
One-hundred pound
And quite revealingly is sweatered.
The howl she gives,
Executives
Shudder to hear when, quite erratic,
The huff she’ll get
And walk off set,
Making her exit so dramatic !

“LUCKY"
by
GEORGE CLIVE
Almost midnight; Cor-
poral Bororo, prone in
a patch of bushes, gave
his whole mind and
body to listening. From the
European club, some 100 yards
away, came light and laughter,
the clink of glass and bottle.
Otherwise the little island of
Samarai, headquarters of the
Milne Bay district, appeared to.
sleep under a skeleton moon.
Cautiously, Bororo parted
the leaves in front of his face
and gazed steadily at dim
pencils of light 20 yards ahead.
Was that the chink of coins, a
quic kl y suppressed oath ?
Bororo slowly turned his head.
Behind him crouched eight
constables, ramis and sulus
navy-blue and scarlet-edged,
navy-blue berets, darker patches
in the darkness.
Now, thought Bororo, now!
The slightest whisper of air
escaped his teeth. With his
free hand he signalled his troop
forward.
Well as it was done, it was
not quiet enough. At the first
movement, a sharp whistle
pierced the darkness, and a
shout of “K araharaga!”
(Quickly!).
The racing, barefooted con-
stables flung themselves at the
hut in front.
Inside, the lights went out; a
table crashed over, and before
Bororo could put a hand on
the door, another door had
slammed.
“Goddam!” snapped Bororo,
wrenching the door open.
The beam of his big torch
revealed an empty room, lit-
tered with cards and coins.
“Round the back, you four,
quick! And you find the man
who whistled!”
But it was too late.
Oill Summers, the Samarai
-*-* district-officer, was speak-
ing into the phone in his office.
“You found them, did you?
You did . . . Oh, bad luck!
Right, thanks for telling me.”
Cradling the receiver, the
district-officer waved his first
visitor of the day to a chair.
In white shirt and long
trousers, with a small silver
cross on the wing of his collar,
the Reverend Wallace balanced
his pith helmet on a bony knee.
“What can I do for you,
Reverend?”
“It's gambling!” snapped the
clergyman. “It’s got to be
stopped, Mr. Summers! Lucky-
playing is spreading every day.”
“That’s interesting.’’ Bill
Summers . sat-up and reached
for a pencil. “What have you
heard?”
“A lot,” said the clergyman
portentously. “It’s spreading,
and they’re playing for money;
big money, too.”
“Yes, I know that,” said
Summers. “Legally we can't
touch them if they’re not play-
ing for money. But do you
know anything specific? Who
are the ringleaders? .Where do
they play? How high are the
stakes?”
“My source of information
is not very definite —as a matter
of fact it’s my cook-boy, but
a sterling lad —anyway, this is
my parish and I’d like to ask
you what you are doing about
this evil practice?”
“Well,” replied Summers,
patting the papers on his desk
to locate his cigarette-lighter,
“it's like this, Reverend. As
you know, all gambling is
against the law, but provided
that the stakes are reasonable,
and by that 1 mean stakes that
the players can afford, we
seldom try to stop it, because
we know we can't.”
As he saw his visitor stiffen-
ing angrily, he added, “That’s
in normal circumstances, but
in this case, at present, I agree
with you. It’s not just small-
scale, friendly gambling. These
people are learning so much
about everything, and many of
them are becoming so prosper-
ous that it is only to be ex-
pected that some smooth pro-
fessional operators will emerge.
That is what we think is
happening with gambling here
now.
“I was talking to Inspector
Mackenzie as you came in. He
told me that last night his men
raided a deserted servants-
quarters that he believed was
being used for a big game.”
“With what result?”
“Not a sausage. They’re
well organised. They had an
alert cockie to warn them, and
we suspect they are using both
touts and urgers to bring in
the suckers. Anyway, they
were off the mark like light-
ning.”
“But, Mr. Summers, these
people are my flock and they
are being corrupted. I can tell
you that his Lordship the
Bishop is most dissatisfied on
the strength of my reports.”
“I know that. He spoke at
some length in the Legislative
Council and my boss lit a
rocket. Have you any con-
structive suggestions?”
“Well, no I haven’t,” con-
fessed the visitor, “but I’m
sure that my cook would have
some fruitful ideas. I’ll talk it
over with him and let you
know.”
“Yes, do that, Reverend.
I’ll look forward to hearing
from you,” said Summers with
synthetic enthusiasm. “Good
morning.”
A s his visitor left Summers
reached for the telephone:
“Police-station, please; Inspec-
tor Mackenzie . . .
“Hullo, Mac. Bill here.
Life’s not so good today . . .
gambling again. Port Moresby’s
on my neck and now the
mission here is lighting a fire.
Anybody would think we were
on a percentage . . . Can you
come up with a bright idea?”
“As a matter of fact, Bill, I
have had one, but I’d rather
not discuss it on the phone.”
“Good. I’ll come round and
see you in a few minutes.”
The jail at Samarai fronts
the sea, with only a coral road
between it and the sea-wall it-
self. The barbed-wire prison-
enclosure, flanked on three
sides by the corrugated-iron
huts of jail and barracks, had
the police-station on the fourth
side. The back-door gave on
to confinement, while the front-
door opened onto the wide
waters of the Coral Sea.
Inspector Mackenzie carried
none of the marks of the
traditional cop of fact or
fiction: no hard, shallow eyes;
no clumsy bulkiness of body.
Dark, slender and quick-
moving, he led his police with
the dash he had earlier dis-
played in leading a flight of
Spitfires, and now, as then,
owned the single-hearted devo-
tion of his men. He wore a
Sam Brown belt 'over well-
starched khakis.
Mackenzie rose quickly from
his chair and leaned across the
table to shake hands. “Hullo,
Bill. Here’s the bright idea:
headquarters has agreed to
lend me a senior n.-c. 0., some-
one really good, who is not
known around here as a police-
man, to work undercover here.”

Syngman Rhee has resigned as Presi-
dent of South Korea, but it took a near-
revolution, a request from Parliament and
the suicide of his Vice-President to bring
him to the point. At 85 he says he wishes
to become “a plain citizen.” If he had
done that five years ago his statues
might still be standing and his reputation
and prestige as the Father of his Country

Nominations for the Queensland elec-
tion closed on April 26, with 232
candidates submitting their names. This
number was subsequently reduced by
one with the withdrawal from the Con-
damine field of R. L. Rennick, who had
nominated as Independent Country-party
candidate. His withdrawal makes Con-
damine a three-cornered fight: Labor,
Country party and another Independ-
ent C.P.
Government parties (Nicklin’s Country
party and Morris’s Liberals) are contest-
ing 75 of the 78 seats in the enlarged
House of Assembly. The A.L.P. (led
by John Duggan) is also running 75
candidates ; the Q.L.P. (former Premier
Gair), 58; the Communist party, 6 ; and
there are 17 Independents. Only two
seats are uncontested —Cunningham and
Isis. Speaker Fletcher and Education
Minister Pizzey, both Country-party
members, hold the seats.
Apart from these two the only seat the
A.L.P. is not contesting is the Liberal-
held Toowong. The Government parties
are not opposing A. Coburn, Independent
member for Burdekin, and in Port
Curtis, now held by J. Burrows (A.L.P.),
they are leaving the running to another
Independent, D. H. Neill-Ballantine.
Warrego was to have had a Country-
party candidate, but he got to the
starting-post too late to lodge his nomina-
tion ; it will now be a straight-out fight,
between A.L.P. and Q.L.P. —rather to
the dismay of the A.L.P. occupant of
the seat, J. J. Dufficy, who had been
expecting a three-cornered fight. Polling-
day is May 28.

H.M.A.S. Perth, sunk in the Java Sea
in 1942 in a gallant fight against great
odds, will not be disturbed, Acting
External Affairs Minister Barwick told
the Reps. He said that as soon as the
Government heard that negotiations were
going on between Japan and Indonesia
for salvaging for scrap a large number
of sunken ships, it had taken steps to
ensure that the Perth was excluded from
the list.

Labor’s A.L.P. Senate pre-selection
ballot result was a nasty slap in the
face for Arthur Calwell and his moder-
ates, for the Left-wing succeeded in
ousting John Ignatius Armstrong, Senator,
Deputy-leader in the Senate after 1951,
Chifley’s Minister for Supply and
Munitions, Minister in Charge of the
Royal Visit in 1948, and a former
Labor stalwart in the Sydney City
Council. The selection went to Fitz-
gerald, a white-haired boy of Dr. Evatt,
defeated in 1955 as M.H.R. for Phillip ;
L. Murphy, a piotege of the Left-
wing ; and D. McClelland, of the execu-
tive of the A.L.P., and a Left-winger.
The winners formed a complete Left-
wing ticket, and it was all done by
cunning use of “minority tactics.”

A Sydney judge has urged women
to use their “power of nagging” to
stop their husbands from driving under
the influence of liquor. All very well;
but on the other hand, if the wives didn’t

influence.

/"''alwell, in one of his typically well-
misinformed statements on defence,
had this to say:
The St. Mary’s ammunition factory
cost some £26 million, but will never be
used at full capacity except in war, if then.
By this sort of reasoning fire-brigades are
a waste of money because they aren’t
used to full capacity except when fires
break out.

The Turks, who really know how to
riot, are under curfew because the
students of Istanbul University and
others want to replace Menderes, the
existing Prime Minister, with Ismet
Inonii, commander of XX Corps in
World War I, Chief of the General Staff
1920, Prime Minister 1923-37 with a
slight break, President 1937-50. Only
76, he has several years to catch-up on
Syngman Rhee and Dr. Adenauer, but
he seems a strange champion for youth.
However, in the 1920’s Istanbul had a
gatekeeper, Zaro Aga, who was authen-
tically 157 and who had fought at the
siege of Acre in the Napoleonic wars.

Refuting the prophecies of the
calamity-howlers about the changed form

more ex-servicemen turned up to march
than in the previous year, and in the

Sporting fixtures were affected by the

Settlement in Cyprus is delayed be-
cause Eoka has split. Gangs of armed
and masked men, assumed to be the
supporters of Archbishop Makarios,
wrecked the Grivas party’s newspaper
during a violent quarrel about the size
of British bases. They beat-up the
leader-writer and have been holding-up
paper-deliveries at pistol-point because
the journal has been un-Christian enough
to say hard words about the Archbishop.
Democracy promises to be lively in
Cyprus when the freedom millenium is
achieved, even if it's not genuine.

J. F. (“Lachie”) McDonald, who at one
time was a Bulletin representative in
Melbourne and afterwards correspondent
in South-east Asia for the “Daily Mail,”
has become the centre of a political
storm in New Zealand, where in recent
years he has been editing the “Bay of
Plenty Times.” From there he was lately
appointed N.Z. Government Trade Com-
missioner at Hong Kong, but before he
could take-up the job he was success-
fully challenged by a civil servant on
appeal to the Public Service Commis-
sion : which means that the civil service
objects to the appointment of outsiders.
The N.Z. “Herald” commented, “The
right of appeal becomes a contradiction
in terms if it is so loaded in favor of
the appellant 4s to make the civil service
a closed shop.”

Work on the establishment of a steel-
works at Whyalla (S.A.) is to be speeded-
up, Premier Playford said last week. This
has been made necessary by the increased
demand for steel. Playford said that
many of the steel-making processes
would, under the expedited programme,
how be in production well before 1965.
Steel output would be “much beyond”
the 400,000 tons originally planned.

N. S. Wales A.L.P. Conference begins
in Sydney on June 11 and one wily
measure is a motion put forward by 24
branches, all curiously moved by a single
thought—that it is wrong for M.L.C.’s
to hold senior portfolios. That is what
Downing reaps from his opposition to
the appointment of Dr. "Evatt as
Chief Justice and Maloney from his
falling-out with Ernie O’Dea and other
union pannikin - bosses. The fact that
these resolutions are on the agenda-sheet
suggests that some people in the party
are not optimistic about abolition of the

Sydney’s discarded trams have been
proving hard to dispose of, and someone
up Coonamble way got the idea of offer-
ing a dozen or so of them to aboriginal
families in the district who are now
“housed” in disgraceful humpies. Then
the welfare association struck a snag
in the form of building-regulations which
make the minimum height for ceilings
Bft. The tram-ceilings are 7ft. B£in. high.
So far the authorities won’t consider
relaxing the regulation, although the
shacks now used by the abos. have only
about sft. standing-space.

Tn the Arbitration Court last week
Comrade J. F. Hill complained that
Melbourne “Age” had mentioned in
reporting his appearance as counsel for
the Seamen’s Union that he was secretary
of the Victorian branch of the Commu-

him, he said. Can anybody imagine
Menzies feeling “smeared” at being
referred to as the leader of the Liberal
party? Or Calwell at being branded as
Labor’s leader?

It is astonishing what a difference
power makes to the holder. The loudest
jeers of Communism have always been
reserved for titles and honorifics, but it
is noticed that in the joint communique
of Nehru and Chou En-lai the latter has
no objection to referring to himself as
“his Excellency.” The outcome of the
talks was expressed succinctly by Nehru:
“Both sides were unable to convince each
other and we remain unconvinced.”

Councillor Cox, chairman of Mel-
bourne City Council markets-committee,
who has been suspicious for some months
that a cartel is fixing prices at the Vic-
toria Market, announced that a sub-
committee would investigate the truth
of his suspicions. Within hours the
Labor and Country parties were demand-
ing either a judicial committee of in-
quiry or a royal commission and
deriding State Cabinet for not appoint-
ing one. There’s no one as keen to jump
on the bandwagon as a politician in
Opposition.
Professor Oliphant writes from first-
hand knowledge of pressure - groups
maintaining a second-rate outlook at
Australian universities. Still, there’s some
first-class spending on education. Next
year Victoria will spend more than £5O
million, compared with less than £5 mil-
lion in 1945-46. This year Victorian
Government expenditure on education
per head of population is £l4 11s. Next
year’s will be £l6 9d., a solid achieve-
ment indeed by the educational pressure-
groups.

A unity-ticket in the elections for the
Central Gippsland Trades and Labor
Council has been successful, and all the
moderates have been tossed-out, “giving
the Communists,” said one of the de-
feated unionists, “control of Victoria’s
power supplies.” Vic Stout, secretary of
Melbourne Trades Hall Council, pulled
his usual round-eyed look for reporters
and gave out his usual gulf: “I can find
no evidence of a unity-ticket.” Then he
said how pleased he was with the result.

Roy Morgan’s Gallup Poll has come
up with another surprise in Victoria:
55 per cent, in favor of 10-p.m. closing,
38 per cent, for 6 p.m. and seven per
cent, undecided. The poll, which was
accurate almost to the decimal-point on
the six-o’clock vote in the 1956 referen-
dum, does not give reasons for the change
of opinion ; but these are probably Judge
Fraser’s recommendation in favor of 10
p.m. and the increased travelling, inter-
state and overseas, enabling Victorians
to see that what the wowsers predict is
poppycock.

“E.A.F.”: In the compliments paid to
Arthur Calwell on achieving Labor
leadership one fact has not received
sufficient recognition. He has reached
his goal in spite of being handicapped by
the second name Augustus, which is a
heavy burden to bear, particularly during
one’s formative years. If one’s first name
is Augustus one can call oneself Gus
and brazen it out, but if it is the second
name one’s schoolfellows regard that as
a form of concealment and take delight
in bringing it out on all the wrong occa-
sions to the mortification of its owner.
That Calwell has reached his high
position without being embittered against
his fellow-man and with no impairment
to his sense of humor is decidedly to his
credit. As an E. Augustus F., I should
know.

Those who may know say that a solid
section of Heffron’s Cabinet is keen
to agree to extend the Wynyard Piaza
lease to 99 years (from the present 40),
but Billy Sheahan and others are dead
against it. Heffron promised a short time
ago to leave the final decision to caucus.
That was bad in principle, but he’s likely
to be kept to his promise. Meanwhile
Opposition-leader Askin is to be given
a chance to run his eye over the files
of negotiations between the Railways
Department and the lessees.

ITEMS
Appointed to succeed Dr. W. A.
Westerman as chairman of the Tariff
Board, Sir Leslie Melville is Vice-
Chancellor of the Australian National
University at Canberra and a member
of the board of the Reserve Bank of
Australia. A former board-member of
the Commonwealth Bank, with the duties
of economic adviser and assistant-
governor thrown in, he was an executive-
director of the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development and of
the International Monetary Fund from
1950* to 1953. As Professor Melville,
before he went to Canberra, he was a
well-known Sydney personality and
Commonwealth Bank identity, as well as
a coffee-house debater on all manner of
subjects. \

Honorary adviser-in-music to the
Royal Marines, conductor-in-chiqf of

be here two months, on the invitation of
the A.B.C. Born in 1895, he started-off
in 1910 by winning the A.R.C.O. Sawyer
Prize, and four years later was organist
at Melton Mowbray (Leicestershire)
Parish Church. He served in War I
with the 27th Durham Light Infantry,
went back to Melton Mowbray at the
war’s end, conducted his own composi-
tion, “Impressions on a Windy Day,” at
Queen’s Hall Promenade Concert in
1921, and from then on he's been con-
ducting orchestras all over the world.
In addition, he was a member of the
B. Brains Trust, and he’s president
of the R.S.PC.A.

Appointed to the Peter Nicol Russell
Chair of Electrical Engineering at Sydney
University, Dr. W. N. Christiansen is a

worked on radio-astronomy with the
C. 1.R.0. for the last 12 years. A
Fellow of the Australian Academy of
Science and an associate-member of the
Institute of Electrical Engineers, he
designed what’s regarded as the most
powerful instrument available for study-
ing the sun —they call it the crossed-
grating interferometer.
Bulletin contributor David Maxwell
Fienberg —he wrote “Meeting the
Mokolkols,” which ran as a serial last
year—hails from Western Australia and
is the grandson of Barney P. Fienberg,
one of the pioneers of the Murchison
district. Born in 1916, he graduated
PATROLMASTER
from the Westralian University in 1937
and joined the New Guinea Administra-
tion as a cadet patrol-officer the same
year.
In 1941 he set out to be a gunner in
the A.1.F., but ended-up in A.N.G.A.U.
as a long-range-patrol specialist attached
to various A.I.F. and U.S. formations,
and finished the war a captain with the
M.C. and a “mention.” Immediately
after the war he did periods on second-
ment in Tanganyika and at the Colonial
Office, and then a stint as lecturer at
the Australian School of Pacific Adminis-
tration, before he went back to the
Territory as Senior Native Authorities
Officer and started organising native
local-government councils. These are not
the municipal sort of bodies, but hybrids
evolved to suit conditions in the Terri-
tory —they maintain law and order, levy
direct taxes, build schools and establish
aid-posts. They also launch projects for
economic development—for instance,
near Rabaul the council-system was used
to start the Tolai Cacao Project, which
now operates 17 modern cacao-fermen-
teries and markets a healthy proportion
of the Territory’s fast-growing cacao
exports. In 1952 Fienberg was sent to
the U.N./for two years as the Australian
nominee in the Trusteeship Division of
the Secretariat. Since returning he has
been caught-up in Port Moresby as an
executive officer in the Department of
the Administrator.

Back on a fourth visit, Canon Julian
Bickersteth, chaplain to the Queen and
resident canon of Canterbury Cathedral,
was chaplain and history-master at Mel-

went overseas as a padre and won the
Military Cross. In 1919 he became head
of St. Peter’s College, Adelaide, stayed
until 1933, then returned to England,
but in 1948 was back on tour here and
in other countries raising funds for the
restoration of war-damaged Canterbury
Cathedral. While in Perth on the present
visit he was able to spend a day or two
with a former pupil, J. H. Reynolds,
Warden of St. George's College.

horses for shows and rodeos George
Graham, who called at The Bulletin
while in Sydney for Anzac Day, went
to War I with the old 9th Battalion,
collected a Blighty, and while in London,
before being repatriated to Australia,
was one of the guard-of-honor to King
George V at the opening of Australia
House in 1918. A subsequent role of
a similar kind over there was acting as
standard-bearer to the Australian Con-
tingent at the 1937 ex-servicemen’s
parade in London ; and further on, in


1955, he was in the party of Old Diggers
who revisited Gallipoli to re-enact the
Landing and were guests of the Turkish
and Greek Governments and entertained
by the French and Belgians. A Primary
Producers’ Union branch - president,
which gives him the freedom of shows
in Australia, he’s shortly going overseas
again, first to England, where he plans
to take in as many agricultural shows
as he can, and then to Rome for the

“Laddie” farewells a charming and
gallant personality:
Passed on at Moss Vale (N.S.W.), William
Dalton Wormald —“Jimmy” to all his many
friends, and a member of the English side of
the well-known Wormald family.
Having flown in England since 1920, and
on the R.A.F. Reserve, he tried to join the
R.A.A.F. while in Australia, but was told
“they did not want old gents of 34.”
So, as a qualified mechanical and electrical
engineer, he enlisted in the Royal Australian
Engineers as a sapper, and left in the Queen
Mary with the 2/4th Field Park, 9th Divvy,
and was in the advance in the Western Desert
through to Mersa Matruh.
He was wounded at Mersa Matruh, invalided,
and later became partly crippled. After the war
he would “go walkabout” in his car, cover-
ing hundreds of miles and was well-known
and welcomed by a large circle of cobbers
in many towns, mostly over the southern areas
of N.S.W. He prided himself that, though ai*

the rock-wall, and there he was! On
the reef-edge; a big grey fellow, fast
asleep, head tucked under his shoulder,
the tide coming in lapping his feet.
“You're no ladybird !”
Although our careful approach was very
quiet he woke-up. He looked tired,
forlorn, weary to the point of exhaustion.
I said: “What is he?”
Other Half said: “I don’t know, but
he looks as though he’s come a long
way ; we’ll call him ‘Voyager’.”
Under our careful watch he slept till
midday, then took the water and
paddled along the edge of the beach.
We thought of the good old Staff of
Life bread. Half-a-loaf, tossed over
the stone-wall, disappeared in a matter
of seconds. We thought of greenstuff
(the garden was full of lettuce); half-a-
dozen lettuce went the way of the bread.
Then, replete, he took-off up the river,
and we thought: “He’s gone!”
We spent some hours poring over
Cayley’s What Bird Is That?, but we
couldn’t find the answer to “What bird
is this?” We thought he had gone, but
about 8 p.m., when the moon was coming
up, he announced his return, “Dar-dot-
dar,” starting-up all the dogs down
Middle Harbor. Pandemonium!
Early next morning he was in his old
possie on the reef-edge. We decided he’d
come to stay. A whole loaf of bread
and half-a-dozen lettuce. After breakfast,
he did his toilet, meticulously combing
and preening himself, had a casual,
exploratory swim along the beach and
the small rock-reef, came ashore, and
went to sleep.
In the air he was majestic, powerful!
We’d see the “landing-gear” come down
—pink webbed feet. He’d hit the water
and leave a long “V” of wake behind
him (Rose Bay flying-boats couldn’t do
better).
We noticed he’d drink the saltwater,
shake his head, and spit it out. We
chipped a hole in the rock-reef above
high-tide mark and filled it with fresh-
water and, with the food placed close,
he soon discovered it. We held him
thus for a few days, and every day was
Christmas (from Voyager’s angle at
least) ; and then the inevitable dis-
covery. Slug-guns, air-guns, shanghais
—juvenile “sportsmen” of the genus
Homo had arrived. Something had to
be done. He was hunted, harried and
chased for three days.
A cunningly devised wire-net trap,
complete with the food and water,
coaxed him into captivity, and we took
him to Taronga Park—the ignominy of
it! We felt like traitors —lower than
low! But it was for the best. Subse-
quent inquiries revealed that he was an
Emden Goose and, put in a Taronga
pool, he found a mate. Jubilation.
We visit him every couple of months
and, believe it or not, when he sights the
half-loaf and the lettuce we are greeted
with the old “Dar-dot-dar, dar-dot-dar!”

“B. A. Ker”: I had always found
Arthur Upfield’s observations of the
Australian scene accurate, but I shied
at his description, in Death of a Lake,
of the brick chimney collapsing in the
homestead conflagration. That just
doesn’t happen. I can count at least a
dozen slab, weatherboard, and fibro
houses I’ve seen burnt-down, and the
chimney remained standing in every
case. Why shouldn’t it? There’s nothing
in a chimney to be seriously damaged
by fire. A chimney my Dad built is still
puffing merrily—in its second house. The
first house was burnt-down and the
present cottage built around the still-
standing chimney.

“O-Twit”: Most country storekeepers
agree that without cash-customers they
couldn’t carry the credit-buyers. Much
the same applies to country doctors,
though they have a more intimate know-
ledge of family affairs and accept the
situation with more understanding. Pay-
ing an account one man was offered the
consolation by his doctor that the money
would be going to a good home. “I’m
glad,” he replied with a wry grin. “It’s
been well cared-for where it came from.”

“Shamuseen”: In sign-language the
Torres Strait binghi can outdistance and
beat for time a crack Navy signaller
using semaphore or Aldis-lamp. I was
supercargo on one of my company’s
luggers when, at greater-than-hailing
distance, we passed another of our craft
sailing westerly in the direction of our
headquarters trading-station. As the
sailing-schedule of the sighted craft pro-
vided for a trip round the eastern islands
of the strait', I was mystified as to her
departure from sailing - orders. My
puzzlement was shared by Mairu, my
native skipper, who, however, in the
space of seconds sought and got informa-
tion. First waving to his vis-a-vis on the
other vessel to attract attention, he
cupped his head in hands and slowly
twisted it from side to side, whereupon

the other dusky skipper stepped to the
foremast, and in exaggerated gestures
pretended to write on the mast, pointed
in the direction of the 20-mile-distant
Thursday Island, then towards our head-
station of Badu, and finally towards the
east. Mairu decoded immediately. The
other skipper was carrying an important
letter from the Thursday Island authori-
ties ; he had been instructed to return
to his home-station and from there pro-
ceed for the eastern islands.

“True”: Unlucky though it was for
some barracker, for a Horsham (Vic.)
ruckman it was no ill wind that blew a
lOs.-note into the middle of the game.
He took only a second to pick up the
note and stuff it safely down his sock,
sure of a dividend on that day’s play.

HOW WENT THE CAPTAINS?
You think I cannot helm a ship ?
Go to! I know my vessel well,
Her powers are the extension of
My native sense; I hear her bell
In sleep and at the shock of dawn,
I heed her flexile timbers move
With easy music as the waves
Impel allegiance and love.
We’ll leap the gulfs and learn the seas
As striplings learned them in a time
When ships were lions on a leash,
And chanties wilder than a rhyme . . ,
When sirens had a spell to rouse
The briny alien in the blood;
When men had proper wisdom of
The fume of waters at the flood.
You think I boast? I tell you plain
My heart upon the plan is set,
Not courage but a fever drives
My forces outward from the net
Of land and humans, and the grip
Of hands too warm, the jealous ties;
There comes an hour when heaven is
No more or less than candid skies
And friendless winds and shouting seas,
And hard defiance of the prow . . .
I have discovered what I am,
I know my sort of metal now ...
Not courage ; but unbreakable
The need to be the self alone,
To give the self to harsher truth,
To clothe in truth the sullen bone.
How went the captains ? like a host
High-mounted on their sharp disdain.
How went the captains, seabird-grey
And tall with fury out of Spain!
How go my loves ? I do not care,
But wish them luck and bid farewell;
l take no loves with me. And pray
My foes most cordially in hell.
The wit grows sick of protocol,
The winds blow clean through flesh and
fog,
Now sunlight down the channel streams,
And lively tidings in the log . . .
We’ll hunt red suns and flying moons,
The ship will track her certain star,
We’ll top the wave and thrash the storms
From southern spit to Africa.
God speed the captain and the ghost
That comes alive behind their host . . .
God speed the self that finally
Hath no more fear of man or sea.

“Lastitia”: Native women’s clubs
instituted in New Guinea villages could
lead to feminine emancipation, and even
to divorce, which could be expeditiously
managed if the ladies take a leaf out
of the book of one Torres Strait islands
matron. Marital affairs hadn’t been
going well, but I was surprised when
Masala told me she had “altogether
pinish diborce” her somewhat shiftless
spouse. Asked how she had managed
the formalities, she declared trium-
phantly: “I pinish tear up marriage-
paper ! ”

“0.G.”: “Ceg’s” par. (B. 30/3/’6O)
reminds me: When the Duke of Windsor
(then Prince of Wales) visited Malaya,
“You re Welcome to drop in any time for a cup o’ tea.”
a big exhibition was staged in Singapore.
Gold and silver art-work, lent by the
Siamese Government, was brought under
strong military escort to our ship at
Bangkok. When we anchored in Singa-
pore an ordinary-looking Chinese clerk
came aboard, produced documents, took
delivery of the treasure, placed it on
the floor of an ordinary open sampan,
and sat in the bow while a coolie rowed
him ashore. To the same exhibition
was sent a troupe of Dyak dancers from
inland-Borneo. At sea they were shown
the engine-room, allowed to feel snow-
clad refrigerator-pipes, and each received
a piece of ice. When they reached the
deck the ice had become watery, so each
man solemnly placed his piece out in
the sun —to dry.
* * * *
“Eidu”: The weight of the large sun-
flower had bent the stalk over, so that
the flower rested face-down on a fence-
post. Rain had filled the deep cup of
its reverse with water, in which were
revelling in turn, civvies, sparrows,
starlings, peewees and a dove. I’d sug-
gest to Sydneysiders that if they want
to bring the lovely little finches to their
gardens they should grow one of the
giants—the little chaps love the seed.
“Yakipan”: A Dutch friend assures
me it is standard practice in Holland
and Germany to hang a bunch of
greenery from the roof of a newly-
erected house (B. 30/3/’6O). The custom
is time-honored. With the greenery in
place, the builders adjourn to the local
inn, where the master-builder turns it on.
Anyone who has had anything to do
with the building of the house sees the
green signal and hurries off to join the
party.
* * * *
“Emel”: The learner-shearer, toiling
over a tough sheep, looked up as the
boss-of-the-board came up holding a
double-handful of grass. As he dropped
it at the tyro’s feet the trump drawled:
“Just a little snack—that sheep will be
hungry before you’re finished with it!”
* * *
“Dido”: Mentioned “bush biscuits” in
front of my two lads and tried to explain
what they were. Under their coercion I
inquired at the grocer’s—“ Yes, certainly,
madam ; we still have them.” But, oh, so
light and crummy! They’re the same
shape perhaps—but no bushman could
do a day’s work on a packet these days.
* * * *
“Peter Simple”: When a young peewee
that frequents my garden pounced on
some cheese that I’d tossed to him he was
immediately dive-bombed by his parents,
who’d been watching from a nearby tree.
Thinking they were jealous of the easy
tucker, I tossed them some, too, but the
offering was ignored. The same thing has
happened at least half-a-dozen times, and
the only way I can get the youngster to
accept his daily ration is to place it under
an old outside table where he’s protected
from air-attacks. His parents, having
taught him to fend for himself, may feel
that he shouldn’t develop the bad habit
of accepting the dole from humans.


TThe conclusion of a long legal battle
has spelt a win for well - known
Northern Territorian Joe Kilgariff.
When Joe’s sister-in-law, Miss Monica
Minahan, 'decided nine years ago that
the time had come for another first-class
hotel at Alice Springs she met with
strong opposition to the granting of
another licence, necessitating an appeal
to the High Court, which ruled in her
favor. Then a succession of building-
worries brought Joe into the picture.
Joe knows quite a lot about the trouble
inseparable from getting anything con-
structed in the Territory, for he built
hotels at both Barrow Creek and Tennant
Creek ; but when he gets his teeth into
a problem something usually gives way,
and as a rule it isn’t Joe’s molars. He
got the building up (cost about £150,000),
and then went after the licence. Granted;
and within a few hours the beer was
flowing.
I first met Joe Kilgariff in 1927, when
he was the licensee of the Alice's only
pub, the Stuart Arms. Five of us landed-
in one night from Bega (N.S.W.) after a
gruelling trip over the Depot Sandhills
and nine crossings over the Finke River.
Those sandhills and crossings took some
negotiating in a 1924-model car, even
with matting. And were we thirsty!
We knew beer was going to be dear,
for we had paid Sam Irvine 4s. 6d. a
bottle for it back at Blood's Creek, and
that was the price of a bottle of rum in
those days almost anywhere in N.S.W.
outside the Far West. So we decided that
three bottles would be our limit, and drew
straws to see who would shout. Joe
produced the three bottles, and the loser
handed him a fiddly. He picked it up,
looked at it, turned it over and laid it on
the counter. One of the party remarked:
“It’s quite good! ” “I know,” said Joe ;
“but just add another seven-bob —beer’s
now nine-bob a bottle.”
Later, when the Granites Rush broke-
out, Joe loaded a lorry with beer and a
refrigerator and set off for the field,
selling the whole consignment at £1 a
bottle. Like the late Tim O’Shea, of the
Katherine, Joe has always been a fighter
for the Territory, and now looks as if
he has put the coping-stone on his hotel
activities with the new Riverside Inn. My
only regret is that I wasn’t there for the
opening.

“Jaygee”: Eradication of mistletoe
won’t unduly affect the mistletoe-bird.
Although mistletoe-berries are the chief
berry-food of these midgets, they also
consume quantities of pollen and nectar,
which accounts for their alternative
monicker, flower-peckers. I’ve watched
them feasting ravenously on the insigni-
ficant flowers of creeping maidenhair-
fern in my garden.

“Fair Mac.”: My old-time seafaring
mate insists that the disposal of an in-
criminating corpse (B. 30/ 3 / ’6O) consti-
tutes no problem at all, even in port.
“Yes, yes, dear, but I'll have to ring-off now — there's a queue
Waiting outside."
When the bodies of those prohibited
Chinese immigrants floated to the surface
of Sydney Harbor a year or so ago he
was positive that the smugglers who con-
signed the departed to the deep were
lilywhite amateurs ; dispatched with the
proper anchors, the late-lamented would
have remained in Davy Jones’s custody
tili the sea dried up. Concrete suits or
the similar corpse-sinkers of American
crime-fiction? Nothing of the kind!
Merely an ordinary bucket lashed fore
and aft. Filled with water the homely
utensils carried the body to the bottom ;
then the movement of the tide or wash
from ships’ propellers would cause the
buckets to turn on their sides, the edges
scoop into the mud—and no stronger
anchor, for its size, could be found.
W T hen a crew-member was missing in the
good old days, he declared, the wise ones
counted the fire-buckets. If two were
missing there was no doubt as to the fate
of the absentee.

“Colmac”: Our dove-colony in the
orchard has for years been informing
us, in their persistent cooing, that
“Castor-oil’s good.” But time marches
on. Latest contingent has told us, very
plainly, that “We rock and roll!”
* * * *
“Bert the Carpenter”: It’s happened
three times on jobs I’ve been on. The
building would rise to the second story,
then somebody would ask “Where the
hell is the staircase to go?” A look at
the plans would reveal that it had been
forgotten. Few contractors really mind
that sort of thing; if one spots a
blunder in the plans, he usually keeps
quiet about it until it’s necessary to pull
down something already built to correct
it. This is known in the trade as an
“extra,” and the contractor is entitled to
charge-a pretty stiff price for it. But in
one case where I saw a staircase for-
gotten, it gave the boss and all hands a
good laugh into the bargain. The house
was one which a leading architect had
designed as his own home!
* * * *
“Trying Yet”: Honest to a degree, the
islanders of the North would never steal
money or any valuables ; but there is
no hope of recovering headache-powders
(which they love), cigarettes (for which
they have an enormous craving and
capacity) or picture-books. Sent some
Bible picture-books for hospital patients,
I lent them to the nurses first; but was
never able to get any back.
* * * *
“Beam”: The patient had been sent
to a Sydney specialist by a country
doctor. She was wary as she faced the
unfamiliar. The specialist read the letter,
and remarked that the country doctor
was his brother, thinking to put the
patient at her ease. She sniffed. “I
know,” she said. “He told me before he
sent me down here. And all I can say is
I hope you’re as good a doctor as he is! ”

THE M.L.C .—EQUITIES AND INITIATIVE
Although it was a share-
holders’ meeting, policy-
holders in the Mutual Life and
Citizens’ Assurance would have
been impressed by the regard
which the majority of share-
holders and , all the directors
and trustees showed for policy-
holders’ interests when the
controversial vote was taken on
the alteration of the M.L.C.’s
capital arrangements last
Thursday in Sydney.
At the same time they could
easily have been bewildered by
the organised obstruction, by a
minority of shareholders, of
proposals by the directors
which aimed at widening the
interests and profit prospects
of shareholders generally with-
out encroaching on the rights
of policyholders.
The-' board's proposal re-
quired the sanction of 75 p.c.
of the shareholders voting. On
a poll the disputed motion was
lost.
The board’s proposal, in
brief, was to raise nominal
capital from a million to five-
million, and* it asked share-
holders for the right to issue
shares to other than present
shareholders without seeking
existing shareholders’ specific
consent at the time of issue.
The nominal-capital increase
was carried unanimously.
Objections to the second pro-
posal came from a minority
of shareholders, and their claim
was (a) that shareholders had
already forgone much of their
equity in M.L.C. profits in
favor of policyholders, (b) that,
though the company’s life busi-
ness had expanded greatly over
the past 20 years, shareholders’
participation had remained
comparatively static, and (c)
that the issue of further shares
to outsiders, for takeovers or
otherwise, would reduce the
equity of present shareholders
without the prospect of any
great increase in profit-earning.
It was contended, in favor
of the proposals, (1) that take-
over facilities in the form of
share-issues at a premium were
a necessary financial instrument
at the present time; (2) that
share - premiums received
through takeovers could be-
come available for financing
bonus-issues, whereas reserved
profits are taxable if distributed
as bonus-shares; (3) that limita-
tion of shareholders’ percent-
age equity in profits has meant
that bonuses to policyholders
have been made more attrac-
tive, with the result that much
more life-assurance business
has been written, and there has
been a much greater volume of
profit; and (4) that share-
holders, in the long run, have
benefited from their profit-
taking temperance rather than
losing by it.
It was made clear at the
meeting that any takeovers
through the issue of share-
capital would represent assets
of the general branch, which is
separate from the life depart-
ment, and profits from general
insurance belong to share-
holders.
r T"'HE granting of the share-
issue powers seemed to be
something which could be
scarcely denied to the board,
even if, at some future time, a
more liberal dividend policy
might be initiated.
The M.L.C.’s present paid
capital is £1,000,000. It was
raised from £200,000 in 1939
by two bonus-issue s —of
£500,000 and £300,000 respec-
tively. Dividend for 1959 was
ss. lOd. per £1 share, or 29.1
p.c. on the present capital. The
£1 shares recently sold for £ll
each.
It would be difficult to argue
these days that any more capi-
tal should be sought from share-
holders for the purpose of
furthering the life-assurance
section. Share-capital is neces-
sary in a life-office only to
provide funds to cover initial
establishment charges and to
provide a management struc-
ture different from that usual
in a purely mutual life-office.
In the M.L.C.’s case its capi-
tal has served both purposes
well. Its management over the
past half-century has been of
the keenest order, and its
bonuses have been such a spur
to even the biggest mutual
offices that they have stimulated
life-assurance as a whole
throughout Australia.
The answer to the criticism
by sharebroker M. R. L. Dow-
ling that the M.L.C.’s capital
has remained “'static” is that
the only use for more capital
by the M.L.C would be to
employ it in the manner pro-
posed by its board. And this
Mr. Dowling strenuously and
successfully opposed.
r T'HE M.L.C. has always set it-
self a hard budget to achieve,
and this policy has kept the
management and staff on its
toes. It has the most stringent
basis of actuarial valuation of
any Australian office; itguaran-
tees O.D. policyholders an ex-
pense-rate of under 15 p.c.; and
it has similarly been willing to
take a lower percentage of
profit for shareholders than it
was originally constitutionally
entitled to take so long as the
end-result was that an ensuing
larger life-department income
more than compensated share-
holders for temporary dividend
abstinence.
In its self-imposed dividend
moderation the M.L.C. has, in
a way, got in ahead of what
the Federal Government did
compulsorily to the trading-
banks. There profit - margins
have been so restricted that the
trading- banks have been
obliged to go into the hire-pur-
chase business and other side
activities in order to sup-
plement their permitted in-
come. If, through its own
financial prudence, the M.L.C.
has avoided obnoxious legisla-
tive profit-limitation it should
not be denied the facilities for
takeovers which the trading-
banks have been so readily
given by their shareholders.
It is provided in the articles
of association (1944 and 1954
amendments) that not less than
85 p.c. or (unless the div. to
shareholders at least equals

'T'here is always a danger that
A when a business or financial
enterprise grows to large
stature, having won public con-
fidence and amassed large re-
serves, it will become “in-
stitutional” —that is, it will be
run more with the interests of
the staff immediately in mind
than those of the shareholders.
There is no evidence whatever
that this is happening in the
case of the M.L.C. It is still
one of the world’s keenest life-
offices, and that is something
which should be very comfort-
ing to shareholders in view of
the onslaught that U.K. life-
offices are in process of making
on the Australian life-assurance
market at a time when even
the corner grocer may be ex-
pected, any day now, to be
offering free term-assurance to
every customer who buys more
than two packets of breakfast-
cereal.
It is to be hoped that before
long shareholders can be per-
suaded to take a more en-
lightened view of the M.L.C.’s
position in a changing finan-
cial world and that the board
will set out as a matter of long-
term policy to do this, in the
meantime stating the case for
the constitutional alteration in
mere detail and giving share-
holders more time to study the
pros and cons.
[The directors’ request for
power to issue shares, at their
discretion, to other than pre-
sent shareholders, required
approval by 75 p.c. of the votes
cast at the meeting.
The poll, declared on Friday,
showed that 9281 votes for the
resolution represented 601,226
shares. There were 3859 votes
against the motion, 'represent-
ing 209,068 shares.
The “aye” vote was thus
70.7 per cent., and failed by
4.3 p.c. to reach the necessary
percentage.]
Return to the Quay
A bid by L. J. Hooker Cor-
poration, Ltd., for the
3000 £lO shares in the Sydney
Exchange Co., Ltd., at the rate
of £2OB 6s. Bd. for each share
(all payable in cash by Septem-
ber this year; or, alternatively,
1831 fully-paid Hooker ss.
shares), sets a cash price of
£625,000 on the Royal Ex-
change, Aaron’s Hotel building,
the post-office, the Bistro
premises, etc. It is a fine site,
fronting Bridge Street, with
Pitt Street and Gresham Street
at the sides.
Hooker’s propose to put
up a big modern hotel,
but to reserve space for the
wool-exchange in it; this ap-
pears to be necessary under the
terms of the old Crown grant
by which title to the properly
is established.
The deal follows the sale of
Feltex House, in George Streer
near the intersection with
Bridge Street, for £282,000, and
the completion of several multi-
storied financial buildings near
the corner of Pitt and Bridge,
with others now going up. The
huge A.M.P. building is on the
move. Lend Lease Corp. has
a £2O -million “Rockefeller
Centre” project in hand, and
has big plans for The Rocks
area.
All around the Circular Quay
area new skyscrapers are rear-
ing ; and just across the
water at Kirribilli similar acti-
vity is going on with big home-
unit buildings.
The Quay is staging a spec-
tacular comeback, and it may
not be long before the Harbor
again becomes a major ferry-
traffic artery as the high-density

The Boom in B.H.P.
B.H.P. £1 shares hit
90s. last week there was
general wonderment. The div.-
increase is now stale news, and
there has been no official state-
ment as to the terms of the
next new capital-issue. The
only certainty is that there will
be another new issue before
long, and that Australia’s ex-
pansion continues to create an
increasing demand for steel.
After a slow getaway follow-
ing World War 11, B.H.P. is
now briskly increasing its pig-
iron and ingot-steel capacity,
as well as spreading the range
of its secondary manufactures.
Output of ingot-steel by B.H.P.
and A., I. and S. during the
1958-59 term was 3,192,680
tons. This compares with a
capacity of 1,750,000 tons in
1947; in that year, however,
production fell 500,000 tons
short of capacity because of
strikes and shortages of labor.
By the end of 1964 it is ex-
pected that output will rise to
5,250,000 tons, assisted by the
proposed steelmaking plant in
S.A.
This would represent a lift
of about 70 p.c. on the 1958-59
figure over a space of five
years. It may be taken that
profits should rise in something
of the same proportion, and
that with B.H.P.’s policy of
financing a considerable part
of its capital-outlay—and there
will be big additional capital-
outlay before the 70 p.c. lift is

Unity Life Assurance, Ltd.
TTnity Life Assurance, Ltd.,
formed by a combination
of U.K. companies whi c h
already are active in fire and
general business in Australia,
will enter the Australian field
on July 1.
Chairman of Unity Life will
be Blake Pelly [who is also on
the board of Mary Kathleen
Uranium and is chairman of
Rio Tinto (Aust.)]. His fellow-
directors are Eugene Gorman,
Q.C. (deputy-chairman), Sir
Jack Stevens, and F. J. O.
Graham.
Founders of the new com-
pany are Allied Assurance Co.,
Ltd., Phoenix Assurance Co.,
Ltd., The London and Lanca-
shire Insurance Co., Ltd., and
The London Assurance. Other
associated companies will bo
shareholders.
Unity Life’s authorised capi-
tal is £2-miilion, of which
500,000 £1 shares have been
issued at a premium of £1 each.
The premium has Jjecome a
development reserve which will
be used to strengthen policy-
holders’ funds.
Mr. Pelly says 11 other com-
panies also had taken up shares
in Unity Life, and that the co.
would have a potential 12,000
agencies throughout Australia
when it commenced business.
He added: “We know that
Australian life offices already
provide a very efficient service,
but we intend to add variety
and sophistication in the
benefits we shall offer to
clients.”
R. R. M. Morgan has been
appointed general manager; G.
L. Melville is consulting actu-
ary; and G. J. Proctor will be
administration manager for the
company.

Stage and Music
Sargent and Campoli
The performance of William
Walton’s Violin Concerto at
the Town Hall on Saturday
night, by the Sydney Symphony
Orchestra under Sir Malcolm
Sargent and with Alfredo
Campoli as soloist, adduced
proof in plenty that, although
this contemporary work is no
threat to the established four
top expositions of the form,
it may'at least claim an honor-
able place in the next four.
It is, first and foremost, a
potent challenge to the soloist’s
technical resources, throwing
at him almost everything in
the violinistic bag-of-tricks,
from some truly devilish
chordal arrangements to sus-
tained double-stopping, har-
monics and spiccato ; and, as
these are chiefly concentrated
in the middle presto move-
ment, the agility of mind and
finger is at the service of
furious tempo.
But Walton has also achieved
a complementary brilliance of
writing for the orchestra ; and
although he is short of serene
melody he has much biting wit
and tone-color.
In short, it is a highly-spiced
and exciting piece, and in
Campoli the composer had a
convincing advocate of his
cause ; one who, as well as
bringing an almost youthful
zest to the more exacting
phases, drew from the low
string in the brief lyrical
sections a tone .of ravishing*
beauty. Sargent held the tonal
balance between the solo
voice and that of his forces
with a master-hand.
The symphony was Vaughan
Williams’s “London,” and here
Sir Malcolm really showed
the razor-keenness of his mind
and the extent of his grasp of
contemporary English music.
It might be argued that this
is the best symphony ever
written by an Englishman, just
as the claim might be sus-
tained that Vaughan Williams
is the best English composer
since Purcell.
It is a symphony which
improves with every hearing ;
indeed, it is not to be fully
appreciated untjl after several,
for it is a big musical canvas
teeming with miniature por-
traits, some of the finer
points of which can escape
one at first performance. The
evocative aspect aside, it has
agreeable melodies, a flood of
gorgeous harmonies and pul-
sating rhythms. The conduc-
tor, giving full value to the
latter, pounced hawk-like on
individual and grouped instru-
ments for their entries and
built some notable climaxes.
But the performance will be
chiefly remembered for the
beautiful diminuendos
achieved, the king of them
occurring in the epilogue—a
shading-away by the full
orchestra to a whisper of
sound that yet retained a bell-
like clarity.
The Brahms “St. Anthony
Chorale Variations” was the
third work. Sargent showed
his dynamism to great advan-
tage in the livelier of the eight
variations; yet it was the
introspective eighth which
proved most artistically satis-
fying. In the finale, with its
wonderful ground-bass mode
and its tossing-around of theme
and counter-theme, the work
of high strings and brasses was
outstanding.

Phillip Street Revivals
With selections from a six-
year repertoire, a company
from Sydney’s Phillip Street
Theatre is going on the road
for J.C.W. to Melbourne, Ade-
laide, Launceston, Hobart and
Brisbane: “Phillip Street Re-
Vue” is what those towns are
to get.
To a reviewer seeing this
crowd for the first time, the
show didn’t have quite the kick
and bite Cyril Ritchard and
Hermione Baddeley used to
give Farjeon’s little-theatre in
London, maybe because some
of . the pieces are not being
done by the players they were
first written for, or maybe
because topical revues, like
topical verse, fade with time.
Still, most of the big pieces
went off well: “Soap Opera”
(McKellar-Donovan), washing-
day to an opera-medley; “Swan
Like,” with the premiere dan-
seuse falling for the prince’s
offsider, and the horrible dance
of the goslings; “Bread, Love
and Teddy-bears” (McKellar-
oFrazer), the skit on low-life
dramas with Italian stars; and
“Cinderfella on Ice” (Mc-
Kellar-Donovan), where Cin-
derella is a boy who suffers a
sex-change into a lovely prin-
cess.
Lyle O’Hara was most mem-
orable in “Heavenly Centaur”
(McKel la r-Dono van- Mulcahy),
maybe because you saw most
of her as the front part of a
centaur, and had real verve in
the pops-parody, “Walking Be-
side Myself” (no author), and
the burlesque drawing-room
aria, “Rose” (Mulcahy).
Jill Perryman was insolent
and outrageous iir“The World
is My Ashtray” (McKellar-
Mendoza) and “April in Fair-
banks” (Mendoza), about the
delights for the tourist of snow-
bound Alaska.
Max Oldaker was suave
about the attractions of “Tas-
mania” (McKellar -IVlulcahy)
and the “Kookaburra” (Mc-
Kellar-Mulcahy) whose laugh-
ter reminded him of you; Bar-
bara Wyndon was fey in
“Harpy” (McKellar) about the
Lass with the Things in her
Hair; and Rod Milgate, in
“Golden Hair” (McKellar-
Donovan-Mulcahy), was a
somewhat sedate cowboy whose
girl with her teeth out and wig
on the rack reminded him of
his rrta. ’i
One includes the authors of
these pieces because it is cheer-
ing to realise that such com-
petent and often brilliant
writing is being done for the
Sydney stage as a matter of
course, and at a profit. That,
in the Australian theatre, is
like stepping out of the ice-age
into the bronze-age. (T h e
mont-age was pretty good, also
the dress-age.)

Genesians’ Double Bill
Breaking the lengthy silence
of their Kent Street premises,
the Genesians have placed
themselves firmly-back into the
Sydney theatrical scene with a
pair of well-mounted produc-
tions by James Lang—Sheri-
dan's “The Critic” and a sfage-
version of Dylan Thomas's
radio - feature, “Return
Journey.”
It is customary for reviewers
to express doubts about the
wisdom of adding sight to the
sounds out of which the radio-
writer makes his art; but
Thomas’s haunting account of
his search through bombed
Swansea for the Dylan of his
Welsh childhood and youth
loses little of its magic by
objectification particularly
when it is done as sensitively
as it is here, with the traffic of
images neatly ordered and the
narrative spoken clearly and
feelingly by John O'Hanlon.
The incidental players, how-
ever, would have done better

to leave the tricky Welsh
accent alone: after all, the
piece is nearly timeless and
placeless.
The same O’Hanlon seemed
to find the Thomas charm hard
to shake off, for he carried a
bit too much of it across into
his otherwise satisfactory
Dangle in “The Critic,” Sheri-
dan’s exposure of the vanity of
theatrical vanities of his time
(and, most likely, of ours).
Barry Jenkins, as backbiting
Sneer, and Martyn Corbett, as
Puff, the 18th-century public-
relations man, had flair and
style, though both seemed a
shade too preoccupied with the
comic possibilities of period
mannerisms.
The first act of this play is
still very much alive, and the
company brought it off at
exciting pace; but Sheridan’s
long second-act parody of the
hollow and fake-Elizabethan
conventions of heroic tragedy
in his time needs cutting and
quickening for audiences to
whom these conventions are
too remote to need so circum-
stantial a trouncing.
The music was wittily
arranged and directed by
Patricia Quin.
❖ ❖ ❖
Another Brecht
If those involved in the
North Sydney Independent’s
current treatment of “The
Caucasian Chalk Circle’’ have
read either of the two books
or any of the countless essays
about the East German play-
wright Bertholt Brecht and his
“epic” and “didactic” theatre,
they don’t seem to have digested
much of the information there
contained.
Stripped of the “live” music
which makes so much of
Brecht’s biting charm, Jean
Stuart’s production shuffled
along after the text, with many
rumblings and scrapings in the
prolonged darkness between
scenes (Brecht wanted to let
the audience in on the
mechanics of performance, but
this surely wasn’t what he
meant), eccentric lighting and
a bewilderirtgly uneven cast.
Set in feudal Georgia, the
play concerns a servant-girl
who rescues the baby son of
an assassinated Governor and
endures all kinds of hardships
and humiliations to protect it
in a time of civil war. Peace
restored, the child’s fugitive
mother returns to claim him,
and a village rogue whom the
fortunes of social chaos have
turned into a judge settles the
dispute by a test not unlike the
one Solomon applied in another
famous case; the moral being
that a child, or any other
property, belongs by right to
those who serve it best.
Like the earlier “Good
Woman of Setzuan” (briefly
noted here in a University pro-
duction a few weeks ago), it is
a modern social parable de-
rived from ancient Oriental
theatre and jtold episodically.
This method of construction
has its gains and losses. It
enables Brecht to make many
distinct and separate points as
he goes along ; to achieve an
impressive effect of breadth
and movement; and to indulge
his obviously remarkable gifts
for the sketch, the incident, the
“turn” (he had much of his
theatrical training in the Ger-
man cabarets of the ’twenties).
But, as in the present play, all
this can overload the thin line
of the story, and even expertly
produced it could be tedious.
One knows what Brecht was
getting at: we are told that he
wanted to prevent people from
becoming too involved emotion-
ally in the action of a play; to
watch it as they would watch a
game of football or tennis —
enjoying it deeply, yet never
ceasing to judge it as a per-
formance —to be sceptical at
all times of the points it makes.
For a playwright with social
messages these are honest and"
admirable aims; the danger is
that too much can be lost in
pursuit of them.
It is sometimes remarked,
for example, that Brecht sel-
dom seriously opposes another
point of view to the one he is
making; that he simply illus-
trates as fully as he can. This
is proper enough to a parable;
the question is whether a
parable, lacking the excitement
of true dramatic argument or
examination of character, and
with folksiness just around the
corner, can be wholly satisfac-
tory in the theatre.
Without seeing a production)
that is fairer to Brecht’s inten-
tions than the two we have
had so far, we can only guess
at the answers. One thing
however, is already certain—
the power of Brecht’s language.
Sometimes terse and stabbingly
clear, sometimes scaling up into
lyricism, sometimes breaking
into richly evocative verse and
song, it brings back to the
theatre an expressiveness it has
long suffered the lack of.

Travelling Scholarship
There is no reason why the
N. S. Wales Travelling Scholar-
ship these days should not go
to a painter of abstracts; it
is a likely form for a young’
talent to appear in.
But even in an abstract-
painter surely you need to
know, as you do with Picasso,
that he has developed from
a basis of sound draftsman-
ship ; and of that there is no
evidence whatever in the huge,
lively, swirling, heavily-deriva-
tive abstracts on which Michael
Taylor has been awarded this
year’s scholarship.
The award to this painter,
who may have promise enough,
as he certainly has energy, is
a mistake ; as also is the rais-
ing of the age-limit to 35: the
young student of unquestion-
able promise may now be
permanently cut-off from this
great opportunity.
The entries are on display
at the N. S. Wales Gallery. A
sounder choice would have
lain amongst the works of
Owen Mackenzie Tooth, Vin-
cent Arnall, David Rae,
Frances Ann Smith or Susan
Wright.
♦*+
Turners
Also at the N. S. Wales
Gallery are the Turners from
the Tate. Painted when the
artist was over 75, they are
by no means the best of his
work ; in fact, the gallery’s
own small radiant Turner, to
say nothing of the masterpieces
in the Louvre or the Soane
collection, is much more to
the point. But they are
Turners, and one or two speak
clearly enough.

“Canberra” is a triumph of British functional
designing. She is the largest ship P. & O. have ever
built and the largest Harland & Wolff have built for P. & O. since
the first in 1880, the 3,502-ton “Rosetta.”
Her 85,000 horsepower turbo-electric engines to drive her smoothly at 27* knots are
also by Harland & Wolff.
Harland & Wolff are “the world’s largest shipbuilders,” their shipyards at Belfast producing by far
the world s greatest annual shipping tonnage.

tolerably competent; but in the
remaining third there is a great
deal more sensitivity, both in
feeling and in the handling of
wash. Such paintings as “Water
Frontage,’’ “Valley Farm,”
“Water - worn,” “Footbridge”
and “Quiet Lagoon” capture
Sydney waterways as well, or
almost as well, as anyone could
do it; and the richer and smaller
“Paper Palms’’ is really a fine
bit of greenery, stone and light.

At Sydney’s Clune Galleries,
Gerald Lewers seems to be
going through an experimen-

needs since he had so sure a
grip of form and rhythm in
his stylised birds and other

abstract as in the fountains,
or still from Nature as in his
surprising tessellated owl or
his prawn turned into a gong,
his work is nearly all as
delightful as it is distinctive.

increased steadily in recent years, but at
a rate considerably below that necessary
to enable full utilisation of installed
plant-capacity. Even before Goodrich’s
arrival the Australian motor-tyre industry
operated at less than 90 p.c. maximum
capacity. The problem has been aggra-
vated in the past 12 months by Japanese
rivalry on Asian and African markets.
Tyres previously shipped abroad have
now to be disposed of in Australia.
Olympic Consolidated Industries, Ltd.,
as one of the five major tyre-manufac-
turers in Australia, has found diversifica-
tion a stabilising factor, even though the
group produces over one.quarter of all
tyres sold in Australia.
The Olympic team comprises:
Olympic Tyre and Rubber Co. Pty. —manu-
facturer and marketer of all types of tyres,
tyre-retreading materials and plant; factories
at Footscray (Vic.) and Geebung (Q.).
Olympic Cables Pty.—manufacturer of many
hundreds of types of cable for commercial,
industrial and domestic purposes; factory at
Tottenham (Vic.).
Olympic General Products Pty.—manufacturer
and marketer of rubber and plastic products,
including floor-tiles, transmission- and conveyor-
belting, plastic tubing and footwear-soling
material; factory at Footscray (Vic.).
Beaurepaire Tyre Service Pty.—operates a
nation-wide chain of more than 60 service-
stations and retreading factories in Victoria,
N.S.W./Queensland, S.A., W.A. and the A.C.i.
, Explastics Industries Pty.—marketer of
thermal insulation materials, Onazote and
Isolite, produced in the Olympic General
Products factory.
Last year Olympic continued vigorous
exploration arid development of markets,
at the same time modernising and expand-
ing existing plant and machinery. Nylon-
cord “premium passenger” tyres were
introduced. Turnover, though not dis-
closed, was higher, and profits responded,
despite increased costs. Retail - outlets
were widened, reflecting a growing dis-
position towards tied-retailer outlets in
the tyre game. An important contract
was signed with the P.M.G. Depart-
ment whereby offshoot Olympic Cables
will supply almost all of the £3-million
coaxial cable required for the planned
telecommunication link between Sydney
and Melbourne. Olympic Cables is the
largest manufacturer of electric cable in
the Commonwealth.
Up £46,483 at £1,208,896, latest result
is reckoned after providing £818,063 (up
£4226) for taxation and £636,580 (up

At 17.1 p.c. on paid capital, allowing for
the 6 p.c. prefs., the result compares with
16.5, 14.6, 16.4 and 21 p.c. back to 1955,
and illustrates gradual recovery towards
pre-’56 levels. Ord. div., steady at 9 p.c.,
took £582,798 ; reserves rose, in all,
£567,883 to £4,177,265.
In 1955-56, 1,500,000 6 p.c. prefs. were
issued at par. With the exception of
168,000 ss. ords. granted vendors of an
acquired business in January, 1959, there
have been no other share-issues since the
co.’s formation in 1953, when Olympic
Consolidated Industries, as a-holding co.,
exchanged scrip with shareholders of the
then 20-year-old Olympic Tyre and
Rubber Co. on a two-for-one basis.
High levels of capital-expenditure were
maintained last term. Investment in fixed
assets over the past three years aggregates
almost £4y million. The latest balance-
sheet shows freeholds up £795,306 at
£3,504,396 ; plant up £469,047 at
£2,938,099. Replacement value of fixed
assets is said to be much greater than
that shown in the books.
A larger turnover, plus expansion,
brought a rise in the overdraft by
£743,397 to £1,166,618 ; creditors rose
£373,590 to £2,240,730; and deposit
finance at £1,148,316 was £833,141 above
the preceding year’s figure. Debtors, on
the other side, at £3,768,804 were up
£435,812. Stock at £7,860,894 was up
£771,708. All told, theoretical working
capital declined £742,423, and yet at
£5,658,018 is still conclusive measure of
Olympic’s strength and financial fibre:

otherwise the picture remained much the
same as in 1957-58.
A.E.1., Ltd., had its beginnings in
Australia in 1898 as ~ the Australian
General Electric Co., a branch of the
General Electric Co. of New York ; then
in 1931 General Electric Co. and several
English electrical-applianced producers
formed a proprietary of the same name
to run an Australian offshoot. In 1955
the American interests sold-out to Asso-

holders in the English parent are such
big-timers as Metropolitan-Vickers Elec-
trical Co., Ltd., British Thompson-
Houston Co., Ltd., and Edison Swan
Electric Co., Ltd.
The A.E.1., Ltd., group controls three
subsidiaries: Australian Electrical Indus-
tries Pty., Arrow Switches (Aust.) Pty.,
and Hard Metals Pty., Ltd. Its factories,
located in N.S.W., Victoria and Queens-
land, put-out a wide range of transmis-
sion and generating equipment and
domestic appliances. The group also dis-
tributes Ekco TV-receivers.
The well-established and intensely
competitive Australian electrical-goods
market is a difficult one. The co. has not
shown much earning-muscle from the
beginning as a public co.
Borrowings from the English parent-
associate have been consistently large.
The Australian co.’s first balance-sheet
(1955) disclosed inter-group borrowings
at £545,940. At October 31, 1959,
amounts due to associate cos. were
£3,070,402. This represented a drop of
£431,805 compared with the previous
year, but bank accommodation (£436,261)
made its reappearance simultaneously,
after an absence of two years. Un-
secured loans went up by £300,000 to
£350,000.
Interest payable on loans must have
been a burden on earnings all along,
even though the parent obliged by waiv-
ing its interest-charges (last term £29,686,
after tax) for the second year running.
During 1958-59 A.E.I. “successfully
commissioned” major plant and equip-
ment for several important industrial
undertakings to the estimated aggregate
value of £4,000,000.
However, TV-sales proved disappoint-
ing. The original AEI - Ekco TV-
receivers, based on an English model,
had technical peculiarities rendering them
unsuitable to Australian conditions.
Newly-designed models have since been
introduced, but have encountered diffi-
culties in Sydney and Melbourne where
the market is close to saturation.
In Brisbane and Adelaide the TV-sales
were doing better, and the co. claims
“a reasonable share” of the market.
Prospects in Perth are said to be “equally
good.” On the whole, the co.’s TV-
venture thus far has not come up to
expectations, and from the sharemarket
point, of view the same can be said of
the whole enterprise.
Pre-tax consolidated net profit for the
year ended October 31, 1959, was £44,693
higher at £475,984. After writing-off
£257,097 for depreciation (up £78,521),
paying all other expenses, providing
£187,396 for tax (up £9948) and deduct-
ing £15,362 minority interests con-
solidated net profit was £33,354 higher

capital, compared with 6 p.c. in the
previous term, 7.7 p.c. in 1957 and 9.1
p.c. in 1956.
The steady 5 p.c. dividend absorbed
£200,000. Reserves received £73,226 and
amounted to £512,441 (free of intan-
gibles), after appropriating £25,000 to
cover expenditure incurred in “over-
coming certain manufacturing difficul-
ties” encountered with one of the co.’s
products. There was “redesign” trouble
in the preceding term.
Apart from the increase in borrow-
ings, which totalled £4,561,663 (plus
£1,004,235 creditors) at October 31,
1959, the main balance - sheet move-
ments affected current stocks (down
£308,589, but still high) and debtors, etc.
(up £784,283). Book-value of fixed
assets was £207,291 higher at £2,968,712.
Paid capital remained unchanged at
£4,000,000 in 20s. f.-p. ords., each backed
by 225. 7d. of net tangible assets:

The major part of modernisation and
expansion at the co.’s Sydney works is
complete. The new heavy transformer-
factory at Keon Park (Thomastown,
Vic.) commenced production early in the
current term.
In the traction-motor field the co.
“encountered difficulties with one cus-
tomer.” Legal proceedings were insti-
tuted by the co. in July, 1959.
“Further major orders” were received
for transformers and switch-gear from
electricity authorities in all the States
and the S.M.H.E.A. Victorian railways
have placed a large order for mercury-
arc rectifiers.
A.E.I. has also secured a £4,500,000
contract for power-generating equipment
for the new Hazelwood power-station
(Vic.).
“There is every prospect of 1960
proving a more satisfactory year'’ than
the last term. How far more successful
remains to be seen. A.E.I. undoubtedly
possesses a good organisational frame-
work and valuable U.K. connections.
So far it has encountered many, if
predictable, difficulties. The immediate
benefits accruing to Australian share-
holders have been quite modest.
At the last sale in Sydney the 20s.
ords. fetched 225. each, much the same
as their net visible tangible asset-backing.
The immediate yield is 4.5 p.c. on the
basis of an unchanged 5 p.c. div.-rate.
Adelaide Chemical and Fertilizer Co.
'T'he greater use of chemical fertilizers
has been one of the prime factors
in achieving increased agricultural pro-
duction in recent years. Since 1948-49,
output of superphosphate went up by an
annual average of 5 p.c. Production of
ammonium-sulphate increased by about
10 p.c.
To keep pace with long-term rises in
demand, production - capacity of super,
manufacturers is being extended. Pro-
jects to install greater processing,
bagging, bulk-handling and storage
facilities, completed or commenced in
1958-59 in Queensland, S.A. and Vic-
toria, amounted to about £1,000,000. In
N.S.W. facilities for sulphuric-acid pro-
duction are being expanded and will,
among other things, provide for in-
creased output of superphosphate.
The Adelaide Chemical and Fertilizer
Co., Ltd., is one of the three producers
of super, in S.A. (The other two are
Cresco Fertilizers, Ltd., and Wallaroo-
Mount Lyell Fertilizers, Ltd.) The co.
also manufactures commercial acids and
chemicals.
About ten years ago, sharply in-
creasing demand for sulphuric-acid had
led to a concentration of efforts on the
extraction of sulphur from local pyrites,
because rising imports of American
elemental sulphur caused a drain on
dollar-resources.
In a venture to make S.A. self-sufficient
in sulphuric-acid, the State’s three pro-
ducers and the B.H.P. formed a joint
subsidiary, Nairne Pyrites, Ltd., in 1951,
to mine pyrite deposits at Nairne (S.A.).
Paid capital was £200,000. Each partner
sunk-in £50,000. Later on, the three
fertilizer-cos. formed Sulphuric Acid,
Ltd., centred at Birkenhead (S.A.), to

Commonwealth and State
Governments assisted with
large loans. The Sulphuric
Bounty Act, 1954-57, provided
for payment of a bounty on
sulphuric - acid produced in
Australia from native pyrites
and lead-sinter gas during the
five years since July 1, 1954,
at the rate of £2 per ton when
the- landed cost of imported
brimstone was £2O 10s. a ton.
The rate fluctuated by Is. 9d.
for each ss. by which the
landed-cost was above or below
that figure.
However, the bounty re-
ceived “has been insufficient
to equate fully” the price of
acid produced from pyrites
with the price of acid manu-
factured from brimstone. The
Tariff Board completed an in-
quiry in May, 1959, recom-
mending that the Bounty Act
be extended for another five
years and the subsidy be pay-
able on an altered basis. This
would have aided Sulphuric
Acid, Ltd.
These findings were rejected
by the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment, and a fresh inquiry
was ordered. The Government
feels it is inappropriate to
“continue to pursue the policy
of encouraging the use of
sulphur-bearing material of
Australian origin for the pro-
duction of sulphuric-acid.”
Recent relaxation of import-
restrictions may result in
further problems, but the Gov-
ernment has stated that it does
not intend to avoid its obliga-
tions to assist producers who
had made heavy capital-outlays
when it was felt advisable to
stimulate domestic production,
Nairne and Birkenhead
ventures “have been unable to
p a y an y dividend or interest on
the investment” in them. On
the production side, the output
of acid an d the mining of
pyrites during last year “was

After paying the increased 6
p.c. pref. div. (£9000), the
earning-rate on the doubled
average ord. capital was almost
10.8 p.c., compared with 25.6
p.c. in the previous year. A
better comparison is provided
by ignoring the bonus-increase.
The ord. div. was paid at the
forecast 8| p.c., absorbing
£66,667. At the beginning of
last term £200,150 assets-

reserves were capitalised to
provide the one-for-two bonus

ord. capital to £BOO,OOO in

Mechanisation and extension
of plant is proceeding. A new
storage-building has been com-
menced at the Port Adelaide
works. The trouble with
pyrites-mining is a nuisance,
but not all that important for
the co.’s long-run prospects. If
necessary, the plant can be
altered to produce sulphuric-
acid from brimstone, although
this would involve some addi-
tional capital-costs. However,
the original investment wasn’t
wasted.
Rising costs of raw materials
and S.A.’s price-control remain
the co.’s principal problem
Given favorable economic con-
ditions in the State’s pastoral
industry and a good season
the 1959-60 sales should im-
prove, though miracles can’t
be expected.

Mount Isa Bonus
A ustralia’s leading copper-
producer, Mount Isa Mines,
Ltd., proposes a one-for-three
bonus issue, stockholders regis-
tered May 4 to participate.
The issue will be made, for the
most part, from assets-revalua-
tion reserve —assets of Mining
Trust, Ltd., absorbed last year,
have been revalued—but also
in part from the co.’s stock-
premium account. Involving
9,499,565 ss. stock units,, the
issue will lift paid-capital from
£7,124,674 to £9,499,565.
Directors do not reveal div.-
intentions after the bonus.
However, profit to June 30 last
would be equal to 41.8 p.c. on
the enlarged capital, leaving
ample margin for maintenance
of present div.-rates.

MAORILAND FINANCE AAN INDUSTRY
Wellington, April 26, 1960.
Tt looks as if the Korman
group, Stanhill Consoli-
dated, Ltd., of Melbourne, may
play a considerable part in New
Zealand’s future.
Early last year Factors, Ltd.,
in which Stanhill holds a sub-
stantial interest, acquired all
the £750,000 ordinary capital
of the New Zealand firm,
Holeproof Industries, Ltd.
In February this year the
group announced that it in-
tended to form the New Zea-
land Development and Manu-
facturing Co., Ltd., to process
the products of an iron-and-
steel industry—rod, wire and
pipe. The new co. would have
an authorised capital of £2O
million and an initial paid
capital of £3 million, 60 per
cent, of which would be sub-
scribed in N.Z., the remainder
being raised in Australia, the
United Kingdom and the
United States. A conference
of underwriters for this ven-
ture is expected to be held late
in May.
At the end of March it was
reported, unofficially, that the
Government had decided that
the Korman group would have
a substantial interest in the
New Zealand Iron and Steel
Investigation Co., Ltd., a non-
profit-making organisation to
be set up to establish whether
iron and steel can be produced
economically from N.Z. iron-
sands.
It was reported, again
unofficially, that the Govern-
ment would hold £127,500, or
51 per cent., of this co.’s
capital of £250,000, and that,
of the remaining £122,500, to
be held by private enterprise,
the Korman group would find
£62,500, or more than half. It
is understood that, if and when
the operating company is set
up, the allocation of capital
will be proportionate to that
held in the investigating com-
pany.
This proposal has aroused
considerable opposition from
N.Z. industrialists, and the last
word may not yet have been
heard about it.
C.M.C. Takeover
Meantime, the Korman
group has shown that it means
business by taking-over the old-
established firm, the
Colonial Air: anition Co.,
Ltd., at a cash price of
£779,000. The business will in
future be controlled by a
wholly owned subsidiary of
Holeproof Industries, Ltd., to
be called Factors Develop-
ment, Ltd.
The purchase was announced
as part of the Korman group’s
long-term scheme for an inte-
grated -iron-and-steel industry
in New Zealand.
The Colonial Ammunition
Co. was founded 75 years ago.
It has supplied the Govern-
ment with ammunition during
the South African War and
both world wars.
Since World War II the co.
has ventured into many new
fields in addition to ammuni-
tion and cartridges for sport-
ing guns. It is now concerned
with such divergent items as
crown seals, lipstick - cases,
plastic water-piping, alumi-
nium-foil dishes and lamina-
tions for electric transformers.
The Korman group plans to
increase the range of the co.’s
products and to expand its
activities in several directions.
Mr. Hilel Korman said that
emphasis would be placed on
the manufacture of plant,
.machinery and automotive
items essential for New Zea-
land’s economy and for export.
In the financial year ended
June 30, 1959, the Colonial
Ammunition Co. earned a net
profit of £69,839, which was
equivalent to an earning-rate
of 14.7 per cent, on share-
holders’ funds of £475,299,
which included paid capital of
£81,025. A dividend of 20
per cent., absorbing £16,205,
was paid for the year. The net
profit was reached after pro-
viding £66,000 for taxation and
writing off £12,703 for depre-
ciation.
Shareholders’ funds at the
last balance-date of June 30
amounted to £475,299, includ-
ing paid capital of £81,025
(since increased to £82,000).
A Chevron in Auckland
Advancing simultaneously on
a second front, the Korman
group announced that a con-
tract had been signed in Hono-
lulu for the erection of a
Chevron Hilton Hotel in Auck-
land and that the construction
of another Chevron hotel in
Christchurch was contem-
plated.
The news followed a report
that £22,500,000 (Aust.) will be
spent in the next three years in
improving and extending the
Chevron chain of hotels, in
which the Korman group has
a big interest, and that Hilton
Hotels International, of Hono-
lulu, will manage them all.
Incidentally, the Chevron
Hilton plan for Auckland was
announced a few days after a
project for a tourist hotel of
international standard at Bas-
tion Point was shelved by
Tourist Hotel (Auckland) De-
velopment, Ltd., a promotion
company made up of Pan
American Airways, Ltd., New
Zealand Breweries, Ltd., and
Dominion Breweries, Ltd. Sub-
sequently, however, Sir Ernest
Davis, a director of N.Z.
Breweries, said that more than
£250,000 would be spent in
converting Auckland’s Waver-
ley Hotel into a first-class
tourist hotel conforming to
latest overseas standards.
Whakatane
At Whakatane board’s
annual meeting in November
the chairman said that the third
cardboard machine, with an-
cillary equipment, would cost
more than £2 million. It now
appears that it will cost nearly
£3 million.
Of this sum £715,000 will
come from an issue of 520,000
ordinary stock-units at 7s. 6d.
premium, £1,250,000 from a
debenture loan and £1 million
from the company’s own
resources. Ordinary capital
will be increased to £1,520,000,
preference remaining at
£600,000.
The new stock will be offered
to ord. stockholders in a two-
for-five ratio and to pref.
shareholders in a one-for-five
ratio.
There is precedent for the
participation of pref. share-
holders. In 1951 the co.
issued 229,499 ords. and
150,000 prefs. at a premium of
6d. These were offered to both
ord. and pref. shareholders,
who were invited to apply for
as many shares of either class
as they wished.
The market found no fault
with the premium on the com-
ing issue. The shares, which
had been selling at 435., sold at
455. 6d. and 445. (N.Z.) after
the announcement.
On the basis of a cum-
rights price of, say, 455., the
theoretical value of the rights
would be 12s. 6d. New shares
costing 40s. would yield 4 per
cent, from the current 8 p.c.
dividend.
The 5 p.c. cum. pref. shares,
which participate with the ords.
in divs. to 7 p.c., have been
selling lately at around 235.
They could be worth about
255. 6d. An investor who
bought them at that price, cum-
rights, and sold the rights at
12s. 6d., would have shares
left costing him 235. and yield-
ing £6 Is. 9d. p.c. from a 7 p.c.
div. (all prices in N.Z. cur-
rency).
Whakatane’s consolidated
net profit last year was
£202,460, after provision of
£331,255 for depreciation and
£237,587 for tax. The 7 p.c.
pref. div. took £42,000, leaving
£160,460 to cover the 8 p.c. ord.
dividend twice over. The chair-
man reported last week that in
the first nine months of the
current year there had been “a
very satisfactory improve-
ment” in results.


WALLACE WURTH—
Power Behind Government
By "OBSERVER"
At the University of New
South Wales on April
27 Sydney solicitor
Geoffrey Cochrane
Remington, whose own story
was told in B. 23 /12/ 59, quoted
from Emerson when he deliver-
ed the Occasional Address to a
distinguished audience at that
University’s degree - conferring
ceremony.
He said that “an institution
is the lengthened shadow of
one man.” The University of
New South Wales, he said, is
the substance of the shadow of
one man Wallace Charles
Wurth.
Professor S. H. Roberts,
Vice-Chancellor of the Univer-
sity of Sydney, had said much
the same thing when the degree
of Doctor of Laws, honoris
causa, was bestowed by that
University on the same Wallace
Wurth.
“It is given to few men,”
he said, “to be able to say that
they founded a university and
saw it grow on lines specific-
ally designed to meet the needs
of the technological and scien-
tific age in which we all live.”
When he retires as chairman
of the Public Service Board
next January, however, Wallace
Wurth will have even more
than the creation of a univer-
sity to his credit. He will have
ended a distinguished career,
without parallel in the public
service, both inside and outside
the ranks of civil service.
'T'he man who, as Director-
General of Manpower
during World War 11, had more
power over his fellow-men
vested in him than any other
Australian before or since, was
born in 1894 at Mud gee
(N.S.W.), where his father was
a schoolmaster. He won a
bursary to Sydney High School,
and after schooling started-off
in the Department of Lands in
1912.
Came War I, and he served
in France with the 7th Field
Ambulance, stretcher - bearing
in a series of the battles in
which our troops took part —
Pozieres, Mouquet Farm, Flers
and Ypres notable among them.
Going into the second Battle
of Bullecourt with the 27th
Battalion on May 3, 1917, he
was one of the early casualties
of the appalling 7000 the three
attacking Australian divisions
were to number before that
battle ended.
After hospital, Wurth was
back in time for the great offen-
WALLACE WURTH
sive of August 8, 1918, which,
for him, kicked-off from the
aerodrome in front of Villers
Bret, and didn’t end until the
Hindenburg Line was breached.
He finished the war with the
rank of sergeant.
X)ack then to the Lands De-
partment, shortly afterwards
transferring to the Department
of the Attorney-General and of
Justice, where he had his first
dealing with the legal affairs
on which he was to become a
leading authority.
It was here that G. C.
Remington, a then recently
admitted solicitor, met him in
the course of a working-day
and so began a friendship that
has lasted a lifetime.
“Even as a young man,”
Remington has recalled, “there
was a sureness and ring of
confidence about him that was
noteworthy. What impressed
me most, though, was the
alacrity with which he attended
to my request at the time. He
was not afraid to make a
decision, even then, and to him
red-tape was anathema.”
In the post-war years Wurth
studied law, graduating with
honors at Sydney University in
1924. The skilful manner in
which he conducted himself in
the courts, his understanding of
all aspects of public-service
working, and his predilection
for getting on with the job were
there noted right from the start.
To those attributes he added
another very useful accomplish-
ment—an ability to write short-
hand at a speed few others
could match. In fact, it was
this ability—evidently rare in
the public service at the time —•
that first helped focus attention
on the young law-student from
the A.-G.’s Department. He
can still keep up with the best
of them.
His stenographic skill
brought assignments as private-
secretary to James McGowan,
the State's first Labor Premier,
and to Attorney-General D. R.
Hall and George Fitzgerald,
Minister for Justice and Solici-
tor-General in the Holman
Administration.
'T'hose were no more than
A casual appointments, but
they did have the merit of
bringing Wurth to the notice of
the powerful political figures
for whom he worked. Equally
important, he could observe at
first-hand the inner workings
of government and the peculiar
elements that go to make-up
the character of a politician.
J. T. Lang, during the third
term of his stormy tenure as
Premier, came to know and
respect him when, at the lowest
depth of the depression, in
company with C. W. O'Tye and
F. J. Creasy, he formed part of
a three-man committee Lang
appointed to report on the
administration of food-relief
and medical-benefits.
He came under a closer sur-
veillance when, in 1932, he was
appointed Industrial Registrar
and Assistant Under-Secretary
of the Department of Labor
and Industry, the former posi-
tion involving judicial func-
tions.
When Lang was swept from
office and the U.A.P. took-over
the Treasury Benches, the new
Premier, B. S. B. Stevens, set
what was to become a fashion
in subsequent Premiers, no
matter what their political
color, in seeking the counsel of
Wallace Wurth in various
aspects of government.
Probably Stevens, who had
been ja Public Service Board
inspector, knew better than
anyone else the capabilities of


his former colleague. More-
over he knew of his integrity
and utter detachment from
politics.
It came as no surprise when,
in 1936, Wurth was appointed
a member of the Public Ser-
vice Board, nor when, three
years later, he became its
chairman. At 43 he was the
youngest appointee to the top
job in the State’s Public Ser-
vice.
The twenty-one-year term he
has held that office is also a
record —a stretch of years in
which he geared the public ser-
vice to the exigencies of the
war-effort and expanded it to
cope with the bustling post-war
boom. And always, as one
Premier succeeded another,
Wurth has moved at the
back of government.
■II7HEN, in 1941, Labor went
back into office —to remain
there ever since—there were
those close to the Government
who were curious to see how
Wurth, the protege of Stevens,
would get along with Premier
McKell.
The new Labor leader, how-
ever, knew of old that Wurth's
insistence on a public service
free from political interference
indicated no political allegi-
ances. Indeed, he made a
bolder use of Wurth than either
Stevens or Mair had done. An
unprecedented step, he took
him along to Loan Council
meetings and Premiers’ Con-
ferences, as McGirr, Cahill and
Heffron, in their turn, did after
him.
Wurth became, in effect, a
legacy of government and the
guide, counsellor and friend of
the men who ran it. He still
holds the unique distinction of
being the only chairman of a
State Public Service Board to
attend those Commonwealth
meetings.
\X7ar, when it came, provided
* ’ Wurth with an opportunity
to exercise hi s remarkable
powers of administration on a
wider scale, although he did not
appear on the national scene
proper until the middle of 1941.
Writing of the problem of
preparing Britain for a possible
war, Sir Arthur Salter, himself
formerly a civil servant, had
suggested that the existing
administrative machinery was
“probably not adequate either
to carry out the part of the
work which falls to themselves,
of to take the required initia-
tive to see that private enter-
prise makes the arrangements
which it alone can carry
through effectively.”
In Australia, at least, that
proved prophetic. Although
much was talked about the
application of lessons learned
from World War I, with assur-
ances that this time the nation’s
manpower would be more dis-
criminately used, total war was
something of Hitler's making—
a boot into which all previous
experience did not exactly fit.
The Menzies Government,
drawing on “the bitter experi-
ences of 1914-18,” was prompt
in issuing a provisional list of
“reserved occupations” which
barred the way to the armed
forces of the men who were
otherwise required for the war-
effort. Its first venture into
war-time controls over labor
was the establishment of the
Department of Supply and
Development and the Depart-
ment of Munitions.
Then, following the first war-
time election (1940), the
Department of Labor and
National Service was intro-
duced.. It absorbed some of
the functions of a resentful
Department of Munitions and
left it with others. The first
signs of confusion, overlap,
duplication of effort and inter-
departmental jealousies were
apparent to an eye discerning
enough to see them.
r T"'HE Tower of Babel was just
beginning to build.
To the banner of the Wat
Effort came flocking men from
industrial, commercial 1 and
economic fields drawn into
Government work, either by
appointment to promotions in
the public service or by nomi-
nation to advisory committees
of various types.
An incredible number of
committees and advisory boards
sprang-up, all of them making
demands on the labor-pool, all
heaping conflicting interests on
an administration none too sure
of its capacity to bear such
extra loading.
Although the original plans
for the Department of Labor
and National Service included
a national employment-service,
little progress had been made,
largely owing to the passive
resistance of the State authori-
ties, who did not welcome the
Commonwealth’s proposed in-
vasion of this field.
The Prime Minister trod a
circumspect path around these
Constitutional niceties until,
in July, 1941, with the war
nearly two years gone, he an-
nounced the appointment of “a
Director of Manpower Priori-
ties and Chairman of the Man-
power Priorities Board.”
'T'here was never any question
as to who the appointee
would be. Wallace Wurth was
chosen without demur or delay.
His deputy-chairman was Sir
Carl Jess (chairman of the
Manpower Committee), while
R. C. Wilson and P. J. Clarey
were appointed as employers’
and employees’ representatives
respectively.
When he called his first meet-
ing Wurth appreciated that one
problem confronting it was
clarifying its own functions and
powers. He needed no gift of
clairvoyance to see the chaos
resulting from the division of
control over manpower and
lack of a nation-wide system
of employment-exchanges. He
knew that he had to bring
order to that chaos.
It was here, at this exact
point in his history, that Wurth
displayed a rare gift of states-
manship. Appointed for a
tentative three months only, the
Priorities Board’s main purpose
was to investigate and advise
on “manpower questions gener-
ally”—pretty vague terms of

reference. It had no authority
to act, but was free to advise
any who might care to listen.
Wurth saw the need for a
central authority to channel
and direct the nation’s man-
power to the war-effort, and
he saw the Priorities Board as
a means of achieving that end.
During the board’s brief
existence he drew-up the blue-
print of what was to be, early
in the following year, the
Directorate of Manpower,
which, when it came, was, in
effect, the Manpower Priorities
Board with power to act. He
had honed the thin edge of the
wedge and had not hesitated to
use it.
There still remained, how-
ever, the resistance of the
States to such a measure —a
resistance that fortunately was
short-lived.
The fall of Singapore
hastened the Premiers to accept
the Directorate of Manpower.
They suddenly ceased to worry
about the sovereign rights of
the States when, as the first
bombs began to fall on Dar-
win, the “phony” war stood
starkly revealed as the total
war everyone had been talking
about.
They agreed in January,
1942, to its commission; the
support of the trade-union
movement having already been
secured through informal
discussions arranged by the
Department of War Organisa-
tion and Industry.
Wurth, personally, was most
acceptable to the trade-unions.
They had known him as far
back as the days of McGowan,
and, if further endorsement
were needed, there were Curtin,
McKell and Clarey to speak
for him.
Tn announcing the Govern-
A ment’s decision Prime
Minister Curtin explained that
a new national register would
be compiled, the British system
of protected establishments
would be adopted, and the one
manpower organisation would
handle all these matters, as
well as the placement of labor
and the granting of exemptions
from military service.
Into the hands of Wallace
Wurth was given power over
the Australian citizen that had
no precedent, nor has it been
duplicated since. He had the
right to direct any person to
engage in employment under
the direction and control of
any employer, or to do any
work he might specify.
“T h e Director -General,”
thundered Minister for Labor
E. J. Ward, “can now control
the voluntary enlistment of
men and women in the same
way as he is able to control the
compulsory call-up of males,
and can retain in civil employ-
ment persons who should not
be permitted to enlist.”
The reconciliation of Com-
monwealth and State require-
ments was one of the first issues
to be settled. Wurth, in a brief
period, had to reconcile the
Constitutional difficulties and
weld the existing parts into one
employment organisation, fill-
ing in the gaps with rapidly
extemporised structures and
spreading the ramifications of
the organisation through the
length and breadth of Australia.
It was a task calling for a
universal knowledge of indus-
try, of Constitutional law and
the complexities of government
at all levels. It called for the
drive of a general, the detach-
ment of a judge and, because
it touched family-life so acutely,
the understanding of a Solo-
mon.
For his part, the acquisition
of such sweeping powers in no
way disturbed the customary
urbanity of Wallace Wurth.
He had worked in the public
interest too long to regard his
new trust as other than a
complex problem of admini-
stration.
With power enough to com-
mandeer any office-building
from which to direct opera-
tions, he gratefully accepted
space which Hunter Street
accountant Con Ho'rley, in a
patriotic gesture, offered him.
Later he moved to the “Sydney
Morning Herald” building fur-
ther down the street when an
office vacancy occurred there.
The multitude of tasks under-
taken- by Wallace Wurth as
Director-General of Manpower
are too exfen s i v e to be
enumerated here. To those
implicit in the announcement
of the Minister for Labor
and National Service, however,
a few may be added to give
an idea of the wide sweep of
them. They ranged from con-
trolling the efforts of the
Women’s Land Army to those
of prisoner-of-war work-forces;
from the use of troops for the
preservation and harvesting of
crops to the zoning of shearing.
Because this mild, bespec-
tacled man understood the
human factor in a now-aroused
nation’s concept of total war,
he did not overlook the little
things that made the war and
the austerity campaign, when
it came, endurable. It is said,
for instance, that his quick eye
and quicker action saved a
chemical from going on the
prohibited-list that would have
denied Australian women their
lipstick.
Tn 1942 it became painfully
apparent that Australia was
undertaking more than it was
capable of performing and was
committing its resources of
manpower and materials to
undertakings it could not hope
to fulfil. The conception—
later in that year, in October—-
of a rebalancing of the war-
effort, consequent to the arrival
of more U.S. troops into the
country, had already been an-
ticipated in the establishment
of the War Commitments Com-
mittee, following a review of
manpower by War Cabinet.
The Government felt that,
with such numbers in the forces
and in munitions, the position
should be looked at by an in-
dependent authority. The func-
tion of the War Commitments
Committee was to make recom-
mendations on matters of major
policy arising out of the man-
power-programme as a whole,
particularly in relation to the
commitments of the Service,
Production and Procurement
Department and the extent to
which manpower shortage
would limit the fulfilment or
defer the completion of the
total war programme.
Onto Wurth's shoulders was
added this extra responsibility.
He was appointed chairman of
an impressive committee whose
members comprised the three
Chiefs-of-Staff (Lt.-General Sir
John Northcott, Vice-Admirai
Sir Guy Royle, Air-Vice-Mar-
shall Jones), Essington Lewis
(Director-General of Munitions
and Aircraft Production!, E.
G. Theodore (Director-General
of Allied Works), Sir Giles
Chippindall (Director-General
of War Organisation of Indus-
try), and John Nolan (Chair-
man, Standing Committee of
Allied Supply Council).
One aspect of the situation
appealed to the whimsical side
of Wurth’s nature. Before
settling down for business it
was his humor to look across
the table at the splendid uni-
forms of the Chiefs-of-Staff
and wonder what they might
think if the three chevrons he
had worn as a sergeant in the
First World War could magic-
ally appear on his arm.
Tn October, 1943, Curtin an-
nounced that, following a
report from the War Commit-
ments Committee, 20,000 men
were to be released from the
Army to civilian industry (over
and above routine discharges)
and a similar number from
munitions and aircraft indus-
tries; 15,000 to rural industries
and an appropriate number to
be allocated to food-processing.
Also, munitions-programmes
were to be subjected to further
revision, and it was decided to
abandon the manufacture of
tanks in Australia, a project
that had already absorbed
much and yielded little.
In his drastic trimming of the
forces, and subsequent juggling
of the nation’s manpower,
Wurth had to make his recom-
mendations in the face of
hostility from those whose
commands were most affected.
To the Chiefs-of-Staff a reduc-
tion in the numerical strength
of the fighting-forces was
heresy, as a reduction of his
work-force was to the Director-
General of Munitions.
Despite the opposition front
within his own committee
Wurth went ahead, coaxed
agreement from his colleagues,
and made his recommendations
to War Cabinet.
It is significant that Curtin
never did other than accept
them.
A member of the Australian
Food Council since 1942,
Wurth maintained his hold on
the Public Service Board of
New South Wales throughout
the war.
Not surprisingly, the pressure
at which he worked in carry-
ing out his several commissions
told on his health. Towards
the end of 1944 —with the end
of the war already in sight—he
resigned from the Manpower
Directorate and the War Com-
mitments Committee.
Like other public - spirited
men who accepted high posts
at the Commonwealth Govern-
ment’s behest, Wurth received
no monetary reward over and
above his salary as chairman
of the Public Service Board.

years, it should be added, he
directed his considerable
energies to the task of gearing
the public service to the chal-
lenge of the State’s remarkable
expansion, building-up a work-
force of nearly 50,000 in the
process.
'T'he University of New South
Wales came into existence
because Wurth, who had seen
from the inside the intricate
workings of a nation at war,
got a good insight into the
importance of technology in
the science of modern war.
He fell to thinking of the
value to the nation of a univer-
sity that would train the tech-
nicians and scientists that any
future war, to say nothing of
peace-time commerce and in-
dustry, would demand. That
most people refer to it as the
“University of Technology”
proves that he made his point.
In present N.S.W. Premier
R. J. Heffron, then Minister
for Education, he had an
enthusiastic ally. Together they
planned and brought into exist-
ence the University Develop-
mental Committee, of which
Wurth became deputy-chair-
man. In July, 1949, he became
its first Chancellor —an office
he has held ever since.
The University of New South
Wales now ranks as third-
largest in the Commonwealth.
With a college at Newcastle, it
has established university-
courses in various country
centres.
From a standing start, but
driven forward by the dynamic
Wurth, it now numbers nearly
8000 students engaged in tech-
nological and scientific pur-
suits. Some £2-million yearly
is required to sustain it; within
the next three years capital ex-
penditure of £l-million yearly
will go towards its further
growth.
As well, Wurth has given
what assistance he could to
Sydney University. He estab-
lished its first professorship in
Town and Country Planning,
and he made possible the estab-
lishment of its full-time Chair
in Psychiatry and its permanent
staffing.
Due to the accumulative
effects of years of overwork,
Wurth suffered a coronary
occlusion in 1956. When, after
an absence of three months, he
returned to work, he was
ordered, with a Canute-like
regard for probability, “to take
it easy.”
His answer was to fling him-
self into his work with a vigor
that bespoke a determination
to make up for lost time.
Within months he was down
with a heart-attack.
Once more, having been
again forced to pause, he threw
himself with renewed vigor
into his work, refusing to heed
these sharp, successive warn-
ings that he was no longer in
his prime. He shrugged it off
with a philosophical, “When
your time has come, it’s come.”
The extraordinary thing about
it is that Wurth, four years
after the event, enjoys excellent
health and is working as busily
as ever.
He took a trip overseas in
1957 “to look at official matters
that required attention.” He
travelled at his own expense,
using part of his accumulated
leave in the process. Charac-
teristically, he spent a deal of
time abroad making a study of
university finances and the
financial management of uni-
versities . . .
Wallace Wurth is president
of the Board of Trustees of the
Australian Museum, president
of the Nielsen-Vaucluse Park
Trust, member of the Soldiers’
Children’s Education Board,
member of the Australian Pro-
ductivity Council, member of
the Prince Henry Hospital
Board.
Asked why he belonged to
so many institutions, apart
from how he found time to
work for them, the softly
spoken Wallace Wurth gave
answer: “There was some pre-
meditation about it, I’ll admit.
Truth is, I’ll be retiring in
January. Have had to give up
tennis, wasted money trying to
learn golf, and gave up bowls
in 1919. Must have something
to keep me occupied when I
retire.”


Rise and Fall of a Demagogue
McCarthy’s Five Tears
IN English history one would have
to go back nearly 300 years to Titus
Oates and his Popish Plot to find
an atmosphere similar to that created
in the United States in the early 1950’s
by the activities of Senator Joseph R.
McCarthy. American history could
show nothing else like it on a national
scale, though on a miniature stage the
grotesque drama of the Salem, Massa-
chusetts, witch-hunt of the late-17th-
century had the same elements of accusa-
tion without proof and incredibility in
retrospect.
At the beginning of 1950 McCarthy’s
name was unknown outside the United
•States and almost without meaning in
the 47 States of the Union that weren’t
Wisconsin. A few months later the word
“McCarthyism” had passed into currency
all round the world, and in 1953 Adlai
Stevenson, returning from a world tour,
was able to say, “In all countries they
know of him and in all tongues they
speak of him,” And not much that they
spoke of him was other than bad.
Discussing this phenomenon in Senator
Joe McCarthy (Methuen & Co.) Richard
H. Rovere, Washington correspondent of
the “New Yorker” and U.S. correspon-
dent of London “Spectator,” says:
From a distance McCarthy may have
looked, by some odd reversal of optical
principles, larger than life and of greater
consequence than he ever really was.
But he was large and consequential enough
in those years, and he was, in any case,
the first American ever to be discussed
and described as being himself a menace
to the comity of nations and the strength
of alliances. He was the first American
ever to be actively hated and feared by
foreigners in large numbers.
“I’ve Gotta List”
■CiRST move in the chain of events that
-*■ brought McCarthy on to the world
stage and made his name a byword was
a speech delivered at Wheeling, in West
Virginia, on February 9, 1950, about
three years after his election as Senator,
in this he claimed to have in his posses-
sion a list of 205 names which he said
were known to Secretary of State Dean
Acheson as being members of the Com-
munist party, “and who are nevertheless
still working and shaping policy in the
State Department.” The charge was
promptly denied by the State Depart-
ment, but McCarthy continued to repeat
it in various places and in different
forms, revising the 205 to 57 and then to
81, but without naming any individual
or producing the list he claimed at
Wheeling to be holding in his hand.
A sub-committee of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee condemned him for
making irresponsible and untruthful
accusations, but that didn’t deter him
from continuing to repeat them and it
didn't prevent a growing number of
people from believing him.
As a member of the Senate Appro-
priations Sub-committee he launched
continual attacks on alleged Communists
or Communist sympathisers in the
Roosevelt and Truman administrations
and in June, 1951, accused General
Marshall, who had been U.S. Army
Chief of Staff in World War II and
later Secretary of State, of being involved
in a conspiracy to weaken the United
States in its relations with Russia. That
he had not a skerrick of evidence to sup-
port his accusations meant nothing to
McCarthy.
The Washington “Post” expressed
the opinion early in 1952 that
“McCarthyism would disappear over-
night if Eisenhower were elected,” but
by May, 1953, McCarthy was talking of
the past “21 years of treason,” which
meant he had tacked Eisenhower’s first
year of office on to the Roosevelt-
Truman reign which he had previously
described as “20 years of treason.”
Cohn and Schine
TIE was by then at the height of his
power and, as chairman of the
Senate’s Permanent Sub-committee on
Investigations, had assumed powers to
investigate the executive branch of the
Government.
Charges of espionage, sabotage and
subversive activities fell thick and fast.
His two young henchmen, Cohn and
Schine, were by this time assigned the
task of marshalling his “facts” and
fashioning the bullets he was to fire.
There were allegations of espionage and
sabotage at the Army Signal Corps in-
stallations at Fort Monmouth, then en-
gaged on important work in connection
with early-warning systems, and of dis-
loyalty in the State Department’s “Voice
of America.”
Then Cohn and Schine dashed-off for
a quick trip round Europe, the purpose
of which was obscure when they left
Washington and no less so when they
got back, but which apparently had the
effect of reducing the staffs of U.S. lega-
tions and agencies in the various capitals
to something like the state of nerves
that afflict office-boys when the auditor
comes along to check the petty-cash.
Shortly after this Schine was drafted
into the Army, and shortly after that
the Permanent Sub-committee on In-
vestigations was considering (a) the
Army’s charges that McCarthy and
Cohn had sought preferential treatment
for Schine (his exemption, or failing
that, an immediate commission with
assignment to the chair-borne brigade)
and (b) McCarthy's charges that the
Army was using Schine as a “hostage”
to get him to drop the Fort Monmouth
investigation.
These proceedings were televised and,
says Richard Rovere, “nothing like the
Army-McCarthy hearings had ever been
seen in American history.”
As a spectacle of a political character
enacted before an audience, there has never
anywhere been anything to match it. The
audience alone was almost beyond belief —
upward of 20 million at a time ... .The
hearings ran for 35 days, or 187 hours
on television, and several times 20 millions
saw long stretches of it.... This audience
had not been shanghaied. The compulsion
to look came from the drama itself....
No deliberate or commercial distraction,
conceived and executed by professionals
at great cost, has ever gripped the atten-
tion as this interminable, plotless,
improvised, amateur production did in
early 1954.
This vast audience saw and heard
McCarthy enact the end of his peculiar
reign of tyranny. They saw him rant
and bluster, shout, sidestep, snarl, hurl
accusations and innuendoes, contradict
himself and in general show complete
contempt for law, truth and decency.
in Rovere's opinion the hearings
accomplished three things of value.
McCarthy was prevented for the dura-
tion of the hearings from “further acts
of destruction.” He was exposed before
the whole country as a seditionist.
Finally a Senate opposition was created
against him, where previously he had
been tolerated through fear.
The reports of the sub-committee
weren't made until 10 weeks after the
hearing closed —and they weren't very
conclusive, but “long before they were
written it was evident that the hearings
had led to a new situation.” McCarthy's
sub-committee had ceased to be his
creature and the Fort Monmouth investi-
gations “had been killed.” And the
Senate itself was preparing censure pro-
ceedings against him for contempt of
the Senate, contempt for truth and
habitual contempt of the people.
The committee urged the Senate to
“voice its disapproval” of McCarthy’s
conduct and on December 2, 1954, it
did so by 67 votes to 22. “Not exactly
a vote of confidence,” said McCarthy,
“but 1 don't feel I've been lynched.”
Downfall
I ynched or not, remarks Rovere, he
was finished. In the two-and-a-half
years that remained for him—he died at
48, his end apparently hastened by drink
—he did nothing of importance and made
no real effort to stage a comeback. Some
of his followers still believed in him,
but it is doubtful whether he had ever
believed in himself. Rovere's picture of
him is not of a man fighting for a
mistaken cause or using wrong methods
in a right cause, He had no cause at all
and no ultimate goal. Usually he had
no plan even for tomorrow. His pose
was of a burning anti - Communist,
eager to expose a conspiracy against his
country, but in his five years of power
he showed a complete disregard for the
laws and safety of his own country and
his activities, by bringing the vaunted
freedoms of the United States into con-
tempt, probably did more to help the
Communist cause than to combat it.

RED MILL RUM.
Randwick Tatt.'s
Jack’s Count has now had
five starts in six weeks for a
second and two successive wins
—at Warwick Farm and at
last Saturday’s Tattersall’s Club
meeting at Randwick. For his
previous owner, M. J. Mood-
abe, Randwick trainer Tom
Smith, who still prepares the
gelding, won six races, while
earlier in New Zealand the son
of Count Rendered had scored
four wins. He’s now raced by
veteran racing identity Louis
Moss and Sydney businessman
Malcolm Rich, who got him
for lOOOgns. at auction. They
expect him- to go well in the
10-furlongs £l5OO Wagga Gold
Cup on Friday, May 13. Both
his Warwick Farm and Rand-
wick wins were in middle-
distance events, and Mulley
didn’t have to use much vigor
in either.
As a topnotch lightweight
jockey Jack O'Sullivan won the
1933 Melbourne Cup on Hall
Mark, the same year’s Cantala
Stakes on Carefree, and he also
landed a Caulfield Guineas on
Theo and Metropolitans on
Regal Son and Sir Regent, and
now as a trainer he has had
his first Randwick win with
Investigate, who landed a
plunge in Saturday’s Maiden,
backed from 14’s to 4-to-l
favorite. Sellwood had Inves-
tigate handy all the way, easily
beating Prezor and Circular
Quay. Bought for a modest
300gns. at the 1958 Randwick
yearling-auction, the winner is
by Brimstone (E.) from the
imported mare Shirin Villa by
Walvis Bay from New Abbey
by Cygnus. Pedigree-lines
include two winners of the
English Derby, Trigo and
Tulyar.
Rosebery trainers G. Mc-
Cahon and S. E. Nicholls had
dual acceptors at the Tatt.’s
meeting, and each of them
picked the right race to win,
Grecian Vale landing the Den-
man Stakes for McCahon and
Sea /Hound the Welter for
Nicholls. With apprentice J.
Coffey’s 51b. allowance Grecian
Vale was well in at only 7.8,
and the Denman wasn’t much
of a field, either. Sea Hound
was ridden right out by J.
Thompson to just get there in
a six-horse blanket-finish. He
has now won 10 races at up
to a mile, but that seems as
far as he cares for.
J. Collis, who bought a
brown filly at the recent
Randwick yearling-sales should
be feeling optimistic after
Gayl d i a n e’s win in City
Tattersall’s Maiden for two-
year-old fillies. Both are by
Port Vista (imp.) from Honesty
by Burhan Ali (imp.) from
Fidelity by Constant Son (imp.)
from Wolverine by Woorak,
indicating a speedy line.
Honesty is a half-sister to
A.J.C. Anniversary Handicap
winner Crusader, while Fidelity
won the V.R.C. Maribyrnong
Plate and other races, including
the A.J.C. Easter Plate.
• • • •
Raced by A. O. Romano,
Count Rego started equal-
favorite for City Tattersall’s
Novice Seven and ran home
an easy winner over Glenbeth
and Royal Pilot in fast time
for Novice company, 1.23 7/10.
Count Rego was well placed
all the way in the big field
and was not pushed-out at the
finish. Trainer Harry Plant has
had trouble with the colt, a
nervy type, but there should
now be more wins ahead. A
son of Rego (imp.), Count
Rego was the first foal of his
dam, Shetland, who’s by St.
Magnus (imp.) from Border
Lass by Gay Lothario (imp.).
A win for three-year-old filly
Glenbeth shouldn’t be far off.
She could develop into a stay-
ing type with more experience.
Winners at last week’s
Hawkesbury meeting included
Top Form, a, brother to El
Khobar, a New Zealand
sprinter who won £12,207 in
stakes in Australia before
going to America, where in
one race at Hollywood Park
he got over six furlongs in 1.9.
Top Form was the third suc-
cessive winner from the Morrie
Anderson Rosehill stable, the
other two being Prince
Boissier and Fire Flair.

At Moonee Valley
Soon now we will be look-
ing for jumpers with Grand
National prospects, but it is
no good putting Star De Feu,
runaway winner of the Bulla
Hurdle at the Valley last
Saturday, in that category. On
his breeding Star De Feu ought
to be able to get any distance.
He is by Enfield’s son, Red
Fury, who won the Caulfield
Cup in 1948, from Kooyong,
who is by Son O’Mine (imp.)
from Thumbelina, who traces
back to Gozo, who sired the
full-brothers Gaulus and The
Grafter, who won the Mel-
bourne Cup in 1897 and 1898.
But Star De Feu will not go
much beyond two miles, and
it’s unlikely that his owners,
Terang farmers C. and W.
Mclnnes, will enter him for
the big jumping races of the
winter.
• • • •
Last Monday week Mel-
bourne was to have its first-
ever race-meeting on Anzac
Day, but rain washed-out the
meeting. Many regulars there-
upon went to Geelong, and
noted Rising Rocket’s 10-
lengths victory in the Handi-
cap. The trip served them
well when Rising Rocket won
the Fawkner Welter at the
Valley. A five-year-old gelding
by Helios (imp.) from Uner-
ring by Caithness (imp.), he
revels in heavy going, and his
trainer and part-owner R. H.
Benyon foresees more wins
ahead during the winter.

Quite the most impressive
performance at the Valley was
Sweet Wendy’s extraordinary
effort in the second heat of
the Moreland Handicap. At
the three-furlongs George
Gavine, a Scottish-born lad
who had not previously ridden
a winner in Melbourne, had
her absolutely last. He then
asked her to pick-up the field,
and at the home-turn the filly
had gone so fast that she had
only two runners in front of
her. In the short straight she
careered right away to win as
she liked. Russell Wallis, who
trains Sweet Wendy for the
cosmopolitan team of G.,
Taranto and P. Chressos,
expressed confidence after the
race that the filly would win
classic honors in the spring.
She might, at that. Her sire,
Sweet William, was a good
middle-distance performer in
England and had such stout
strains as the blood of St.
Simon and Son-in-law in his
veins, while her dam, Stygian,
is by Solar Bear from Schwart
by Drake. With such an
inheritance, the Oaks, for
example, should be an ideal
target for Sweet Wendy.
Mrs. Rupert Steele’s chest-
nut gelding Young Flame was
after his fifth win in a row in
the first division of the Somer-
ton Handicap (two-year-old
colts and geldings), but the
heavy track upset a courageous
effort by the Empyrean young-
ster. Carrying 9.0, he had a
stern tussle with King Dassie
from barrier to within half-a-
furlong from the post, but just
when he had beaten off that
rival, Frank Treen brought
Golden Acres along to land
the money. Brian Courtney,
who is having a wonderful
season, and who trained a
treble before the day was over,
prepares Golden Acres for Mrs.
P. M. Maddocks and Mrs. V.
F. Tresize, who race the
youngster in partnership with
L. McArthur - Smith.’ By
Pamphilos from Worrofield, he
will win better races.

The going was so shocking
at the Valley that no horse won
a flat-race with more than 8.0;
and, despite his poor perform-
ance in the 13-furlongs Strath-
more Handicap, if Mac is
taken to Adelaide for the Cup
he will be worth a piece of
anybody’s money. Buzzie won
the Strathmore because this
seven-year-old Bustard gelding
seems to have webbed-feet.
With only 7.2, he sloshed his
way through the mud and beat-
off a strong challenge from

There will be at least three
races at the Centenary Mel-
bourne Cup meeting sponsored
by Commercial interests. The
trustees of the George Adams
estate, who are the proprietors
of Tatt.’s lotteries, were first
in the field and will subsidise
a £lO,OOO mile race. The
W. D. and H. O. Wills people
were next to come to the party ;
they will be behind the £6QOO
Hall Mark Handicap—it was
their good luck that the name
of a very good moke should
coincide with the name of a
very good smoke. Next is the
Stephen King firm, Victorian
distributors of Black and White
whisky they’re subsidising
a picturesquely interesting
event: a £3OOO race for country
horses, to be known as the
Black and White Provincial
Cup. All told, there will be
over £lOO,OOO waiting for
owners of placed horses at the
big Cup meeting.
The Trots
A couple of really brilliant
two-year-olds stole the show
at Harold Park last Friday
night. One of them, Soho
Rose, broke the Australasian
track-record in the first heat of
the N.S.W. Sapling Stakes,
beating Call Up (who had
already won five out of six
races for youngsters) by three
lengths. Soho Rose!s time of
2min. B.6sec. for the mile was
I.2sec. faster than Eden Monaro
in 1958. Crack Victorian colt
Opal Chief began brilliantly,
set his own pace, and won the
second heat comfortably by 3|
lengths in 2. lOf. He already
had in his list of wins the
Bathurst Debutant Stakes, the
“Ha! Ha! I bet -THAT hurt y'r hand!"
Melbourne Breeders’ Plate and
the South Australian and Vic-
torian Sapling Stakes. If he
wins the final he will have
completed the grand-slam of
two-year-old classics. The first
five placegetters in each heat
contest the £2OOO final this
coming Friday night.

on May 1 with Gonzales still
on top of his throne as pro.

putting the V.F.L. season back
a week. However, the two

were a great success: 40,000
saw top-dogs Melbourne nar-
rowly defeat St. Kilda, while
30,000 packed the small Fitz-
roy ground to watch the home-

dently took a step ahead with
the V.F.A. match between
Coburg and Brunswick —first

on a Sunday. The fixture
attracted 17,000 —easily the
biggest crowd to witness an

It had been having a snooze

CIVIL RIGHTS MOUSE
The Civil Rights Bill lately
passed by the U.S. Senate
“after nearly two months of
mountainous labor” is seen by
the “New York Times” as
“something more than a
mouse’ : “It isn’t a bill that
will cause any sudden revolu-
tion in voting-patterns in the
South, but it is a bill that does
open the way to a greater
Negro participation at the
ballot-box than ever before.
Since the right to vote is the
heart of democracy—just as
respect for the individual is its
soul—any measure that ensures
an extension of the franchise
is a forward step.
“This the Civil Rights Bill
does by empowering Federal
judges to appoint referees to
register Negro voters in areas
where local officials are
obstructing the voting-process.
“This is about all it does
do, except to make interfer-
ence with Federal-court orders
a Federal crime and also to
tighten-up the law in bombing
cases.
“Efforts to include even the
mildest school-integration pro-
visions have failed, so that as
the bill goes back to the House
for what is expected to be
speedy acceptance in its present
form it is a modest measure
but not a valueless one.
“However, it is difficult to
understand how the President
can be ‘happy’ with this bill,
as Senator Dirksen reported
him to be. Acceptable, yes ;
but it represents less than the
Administration originally pro-
posed and less than the
Administration might have
obtained had the President
been willing to fight a little
for it, or to express himself
more vigorously on the moral
questions of civil equality.
While moderation on these
issues is proper and necessary,
avoidance of the issues can
never solve them.”
The Manchester “Guardian”
is even less impressed by the
bill than the New York paper.
Above all, it notes, the bill
“contains no declaration that
the Supreme Court’s ruling
against segregation in the public
schools is the law of the land.
That is an important conces-
sion to Southern opinion.
“Ever since the Supreme
Court handed-down its finding
Cartoonist Cummings, in London “Daily Express,” sees a possible result of the
British Government’s decision to abandon its Blue Streak missile.
against segregation Southern
Conservatives have claimed
that it was acting un-
constitutionally, since it was
changing the law under cover
of interpreting it. That claim
is one of the most effective
weapons in the armory of white
supremacy.
“Many ordinary white
Southerners respect the Con-
stitution as much as they loathe
integration in the public
schools ; and they are only too
happy to be told that in oppos-
ing integration they are not
really defying the Constitution
but only a Supreme Court
which has itself stepped
beyond the bounds set by the
Constitution. The Administra-
tion’s bill would at least have
tried to scotch that particular
piece of double-think; the bill
which the Senate has finally
passed will allow it to flourish
unchecked.”
On the bill’s provisions for
protecting Negro voting-rights
the “Guardian” argues:
“White supremacy in the
South is built on the ballot-
box ; in theory, a measure
designed to give the Negro
equal access to the ballot-box
could do more than any
Supreme Court decision could
to end the humiliations of
racial inequality. If Negroes
could vote, politicians would
have to curry favor with them,
Eventually, in counties with a
Negro majority, Negro poli-
ticians might even be elected
to office.
“Unfortunately, the bill
which the Senate has just
passed will not in fact end the
white monopoly of political
power ; at best it may modify
it a little more. After all, it
is hard to imagine that Senator
Russell would have said that
he regarded this proposal as
less obnoxious than the other
sections of the Administration's
bill if he thought that it could
lead to genuine democracy in
the black belt of Georgia.
“The mills of litigation
grind exceeding slow; and
only the most determined and
patient- of would-be Negro
voters are likely to find their
way to the new Federal
referees. In spite of all their
liberal protestations, Senators
Johnson and Dirksen have
settled for a legislative mouse
—and it is not a mouse that
roars, although it may frighten
people south of the Mason-
Dixon line.”
Conference Conflict
T ondon “Time and Tide”
r-' examines a little-known
but important African
conflict:
“On April 7 the All African
People’s Conference opened in
Accra, the capital of Ghana,
and on April 11 the Afro-Asian
Peopled Solidarity Conference
opened in Conakry, the capital
of Guinea.
“The All African People’s
Conference, which was
launched by Dr. Nkrumah in
1958, a non-governmental
movement of nationalist
parties. The present chairman
is Tom Mboya, of Kenya, and
the aim of the organisation is
independence for the whole
of Africa. There is a growing
rift between its conception and
that of the Afro-Asian People’s
Solidarity Conference, which
is also non-governmental, but
which includes nationalist
parties of Asia, the Middle
East and Africa ; Russia and
China are also officially repre-
sented.
“Since Colonel Nasser
launched the A.A.P.S.C. in
1957 the secretariat has become
largely Communist-controlled,
in contrast to the more
nationalist A.A.P.C.
“The A.A.P.C. was originally
scheduled to hold its meeting
on February 1, following
immediately after the last
A.A.P.C. meeting in Tunis in
January. The fact that this
meeting would have conflicted
with Ramadhan showed that
the Moslem members of the
secretariat had not been con-
sulted. Finally the date was
postponed until April 11.
Immediately after this date


Fcuffli In iAc
Fniure
On Mother’s Day next Sunday the people of
many nations -will honour in a spirit of kindred
devotion the mothers that gave them birth.
This modern institution for the reverence of
mothers is, in its way, a miracle of love: that the
greatest human force for right and virtue in this
world springs from the influence of a good Mother.
It was ever so. We have only to look at the
origin of the word “Mother” itself to see how,
with slight variants, it has coursed through the
language of the great civilisations; as though one
word had been put on the lips of Man to express
the sacredness of motherhood.
Across the European languages, past the
Anglo-Saxon, beyond the Latin and Greek and
Persian, we find “mata” in Sanskrit, that ancient
tongue which is believed to be the source of the
Indo-European forms of speech.
And what is its simple expression for us on
this special day of the year? The wearing of a white
flower; the bearing of a gift, or the remembrance
of a Mother who is gone from our sight.' 1
This is admirable. But it is only one external
aspect of an emotion that is deep within us, and
the power of which should be inspiring us not for
a day but for a lifetime.
The true test of our sincerity in the observance
of Mother’s Day is how well we live our lives to
the noble standards to which our Mothers have
directed us by their teaching and example.
The enormous strength of a Mother’s influence
can never be measured, any more than the full
force of human effort since the dawn of time can
ever be gauged or guessed.
But its effect can be seen in every age, in
every nation.
And my wish to the living Mothers of Australia,
who have sacrificed so much, for their families, is
that they will spend a happy and a hallowed
Mother’s Day.
y
was fixed the A.A.P.C.
announced their conference
for April 7, hoping thus to
steal some of the thunder from
their rivals and to undercut
the Communist propaganda.
“The Communists are now
making an all-out bid to cap-
ture the leadership of the
nationalist movements in
Africa, and in particular they
are concentrating on the trade-
unions.
“Training-courses in trade-
unionism for Africans are
being given throughout the
Soviet bloc. In East Germany,
for instance, one such course
turns out 40 potential trouble-
makers every four weeks.
“The Tunis Conference of,
the A.A.P.C. indicated the
nature of the Communist
strategy and showed that the
conflict was about to develop
more openly than hitherto.
Colonel Nasser’s adherents
tried to condemn Communism
as the ‘new colonialism,’ but
Soviet-directed manoeuvres by
Communist sympathisers man-
aged to take the term ‘new
colonialism’ and give it the
meaning of ‘the economic
colonialism with which the
imperialists are trying to
replace their political colonial-
ism in Africa.’
“Communist policy is when-
ever possible to smear and
undercut the leadership of men
like Tom Mboya, whom they
regard as ‘moderates,’ and
throughout their writing and
thinking Soviet planners clearly
show that the ‘theory of non-
violence is a dangerous error.’
“The present situation in
South Africa, with indis-
criminate violence towards
Africans, is grist to the Com-
munist mill, and there are
whispers that the ‘volunteers’
who were called for to fight in
Algeria may be useful else-
where, once they are trained.”
Latin American
Relations
IN an article in the British
quarterly “The World To-
day,” Andrew Marshall ex-
amines some facts and prob-
lems of Western relations with
Latin America:
“From an. international poli-
tical point of view it could be
said that in a sense the Latin
Americans are the largest bloc
of uncommitted people in the
world. They also represent 20
votes in the United Nations,
and while the Latin American
bloc has hitherto tended to
side with the United States and
the Western allies in any major
issue, today Latin Americans
are showing a growing degree
of neutralism.
“During President Eisen-
hower’s visit to Brazil, President
Kubitscheck, for instance, in
referring to the ‘conflict for
influence’ between the two
major Power- blocs in the world,
implied unmistakably that
Latin Americans were feeling
more and more aloof about this
struggle.
“This is not, perhaps, strictly
true, for Latin Americans, by
their heritage and upbringing,
tend to think of themselves as
essentially part of the Western
world.. But here again the
trouble is that they feel the
United States, in particular,
tends to regard this allegiance
as a duty.
“In the past few years more
of these countries, even includ-
ing Mexico, have been looking
towards Europe for invest-
ment and technical assistance
in an effort to lessen their
dependence on the United
States, with which they are
becoming increasingly im-
patient.
“Last year Cuba, for in-
stance, made a concerted effort
to strengthen her' ties with
Britain; and in fact in the year
since the Fidel Castro Govern-
ment took-over Anglo-Cuban
trade has almost doubled. But
Britain’s refusal, towards the
end of last year, to sell to
the Cubans 15 jet-aircraft
which, they maintained, they
needed for defence and would,
in fact, exchange for piston-
engined Sea Furies which
Britain sold to the Batista
regime, has changed Cuban
outlook towards this country.
“And it was not only Cubans
who shook their heads sadly at
what seemed to be the British
Government’s subservience to
the [U.S.] State Department.
While a great many thinking
Latin Americans are often dis-
comfited by Dr. Castro’s per-
sistent outbursts against the
United States, many more feel
that American interests which
prospered under the Batista
regime would like to see the
Castro Government crash.
Deep down inside they also
believe that this is something
that the State Department
would like to see too:
“Political aspects apart, the
problem of financing and pro-
viding the technical aid for the
prodigious pace of Latin
American development is one
which even the United States
could not now shoulder alone.
These are problems for the
Western Powers if the Latin
American countries, perhaps
without fully realising what is
happening, are not to find

themselves being drawn into
the Soviet orbit. And Russia,
with her offers to barter the
tools of development which
Latin Americans cannot always
afford to buy, for goods which
they cannot sell in the West, is
already getting her foot in the
door.
“There are Latin Americans
who would like to see Britain,
for instance, take up at least
part of the role she once played
in helping to lay the founda-
tions of these countries’ politi-
cal and economic future. (The
Cubans had evidently hoped
that Britain might exercise her
good-offices in the nature of a
mediator between them and the
United States.) It is obviously
a tali order for Britain; yet, is
is too tall?
' “While the British Govern-
ment is clearly anxious to see
closer trade-ties with that part
of the world, British interests
still tend to regard Latin
Americans as irresponsible
peoples ruled by inept Govern-
ments. Yet a closer look at
the achievements of countries
such as, for instance, Brazil,
Venezuela, Argentina, Mexico,
Peru, and Chile, which are the
scene of some of the most
imaginative development under-
takings in the world, makes
nonsense of such judgments.
“The Germans and the
French hold no such miscon-
ceptions. While they are build-
ing-up stakes in the future of
this new world, Britain is often
lagging behind: thus Latin
Americans have begun to feel
that it is not that she is no
longer interested in them but
that she cannot now face the
competition.
“Britain today provides
about 5 per cent, of what Latin
America buys abroad. As an
investor she is virtually at the
bottom of the list. A Soviet
trade-drive could damage
British interests far more than
it would those of, for instance,
the Germans.

enced a series of transitions,

did, by reason of their fast-
growing populations alone, the
result would be a social up-
heaval bigger perhaps than even
in Africa. Many of them could
become economic slums, and
their peoples fully appreciate
this.
“That is the reason for what
may often seem their extrava-
gant anguish for progress. If
they cannot get from the West
the means to develop and im-
prove the lot of the awakening
masses they will seek it in the
East. For Latin America, too,
the past decade has been an
era of change. The next decade
will be one of even greater
changes; and what these will
be will depend very much on
how the West looks at Latin
America’s problems and aspi-
rations today.”

No Talk in May
London “Economist” sees
the agreement to adjourn
the 10-Power disarmament-
talks at Geneva throughout the
month of May as “neither
startling nor disconcerting”:
“Before the Summit Con-
ference (May 16) the Geneva
delegations will have to ponder
such evidence as they have
obtained about each other’s
views and the possibilities of
progress, and prepare reports
for the Heads of Government.
After the Summit Meeting,
they may have to digest its
results (if any).
“A sceptic might deduce that
the main effect of the Summit
will be to impose new delays ;
but then nobody at Geneva
seems particularly in a hurry.
“Certainly the Russians are
not to be hurried. In four
weeks of debate, Mr. Zorin
steadily refused to get down
to brass-tacks. He fluffed
rather badly on April 8 by
announcing a ‘new’ formula
which proved to be, in M.
Moch’s words, ‘the same salad
with more Russian dressing.’
He has stripped the Soviet
proposals made last September
of what little specific content
they had.
“It turns out that Mr.
Khrushchev’s ‘four-year’ time-
table will in reality last a good
deal longer than four years ;
that priority is not after all
to be given to conventional
disarmament; that if the con-
ference were to accept the
Russian terms tomorrow no
immediate measures of dis-
armament would follow ; and
that the Russians have not yet
really begun to think about
the problem of determining
the size of the armed forces
that they would still leave in
existence after ‘general and
complete’ disarmament.
“Yawning though the? gaps
in the Western plan are, the
five Western delegations have
at least tried to discuss con-
crete steps to be taken. Their
frustrated suspicions that Mr.
Zorin is merely marking-time
are understandable.
“But no provocation can
quite account for Mr. Herter’s
lapse when he told [a] press-
conference that he found the
Russian desire for a longish
adjournment ‘puzzling.’ The
decision to close-down for the
whole of May was a common
one. The American delegation
and the State Department were
left red-faced by this evidence
of faulty liaison between
Washington and its men in
Geneva.”
Franco and Don Juan
YI/riting just prior to the
April 23 reports that
General Franco intends to
restore Spanish monarchy
this month, a “New York
Times” leader - writer con-
sidered the problem of
“whether the future king—
presuming there is one —is
going to be the father, Don
Juan, or the son, Prince Juan
Carlos”:
“General Franco has for
some years shown a preference
for Juan Carlos. For one

r
thing, the Prince is still
only 22 years old and by
the Spanish Constitution can-
not become king until he is
30. This would give the
Caudillo another eight years
without having to bother about
the monarchy and the monar-
chists. For another, the Gener-
alissimo has hoped that the

able to dictation than the
father, and would agree to

THE WRONG KEY.
carry on the Fascist-type
Government which the Gene-
ral favors.
“Don Juan has managed to
hold his own in the subtle and
clever dynastic game he has
had to play. He has always
insisted that the monarchy
must be above parties and
movements, and in that way
has resisted General Franco’s
efforts to tie him to a Falan-
gist future. He has been dis-
creet, patient, silent and hard-
working.
“Prince Juan Carlos would
certainly not want to supersede
or cross his father, who is the
head of the Spanish Bourbon
house. Thus, through all the
manoeuvring Don Juan has
kept his position as the man
who will be King of Spain—if
there is a king.”
Commenting on the value
of a Spanish monarchy to
Europe at large, London
“Economist” notes that “if a
peaceful evolution inside Spain
away from Falangism were
possible it would obviously be
in the interest of the Western
countries which have been
progressively admitting Spain
into the circle of their econo-
mic organisations in the last
few years.
“Indeed, there have even
been reports suggesting that a
satisfactory solution of the
succession was one of the
conditions laid down when
Spain was admitted to the
Organisation for European
Economic Co-operation last
year.
“The Spanish Government
still hopes for the full Western
badge, membership of Nato ;
and there was much disap-
pointment in Madrid when
the fuss over the plan for
German bases set this hope
back.
“In the United States the
visiting Spanish Foreign
Minister, Senor Castiella, has
been putting the Spanish case.
Against the argument that the
admission of Spain would dis-
credit the West and give legiti-
macy to the present (after all)
Fascist regime, those who
favor the move suggest that
the Western Powers would be
in a better position to guide
Spain when Franco goes if
Spain were fully in the
alliance.
“But would they? The very
numerous Spaniards who hate
the regime might by then have
identified Nato with it; and
the search for change might
cause them to look else-
where.”
Meanwhile, notes “New
York Times” columnist C. L.
Sulzberger, “Franco broods
about Don Juan’s suspected
‘liberalism.’ Says he: ‘The
domination of the Liberal
party put Spain 50 years back
vis-a-vis the rest of the world.
That is why Stalin said Spain
was the European country best
prepared for Communism.’
“And, also meanwhile, the
Communists themselves make
feverish efforts to penetrate
the discontented Spanish
masses. Most of these have
little use for Moscow. 'But,
frustrated and impoverished,
they crave for the change they
cannot have. And fearfully
they remember how Europe
once went to war on the issue
of Spanish succession.”
Dragnet Digest
London “Economist": “The
Middle East was the bad fairy
of the 1955 Summit. Passed
over in the discussions then, it
soon proved its powers to wreck
the infant hopes that were
nurtured there; before the year
was out, the Soviet arms-deal
with Egypt signalised the open-
ing of a new and dangerous
phase in Middle Eastern affairs.
By that stroke the Russians
asserted their claim to become
once more a power in the
Middle East, and now, five
years later, the claim can no
longer possibly be ignored. No
new Summit Conference or
chain of conferences can get
far in making the world a safer
place unless it tries sooner or
later to establish some form of
accord about a turbulent area
that regularly sets the great
Powers by the ears.”

Alastair M. Dunne tt, in Edin-
burgh “Scotsman”: “Berlin is
part of the West’s conscience.
To betray it is impossible, and
even in their blackest moods
the Germans know this. Where
they oppose us is in believing
that any slightest nod of recog-
nition towards the Eastern
regime would lead to erosion
of Western authority and the
swift engulfing of Berlin. This
is the implacable view repre-
sented by Chancellor Adenauer.
In the meantime, everybody
likes the Berliners, if that is
enough.”

the padre to convince him
that we are trying, but I
wouldn’t dream of mention-
ing this because he’s got
the habit of leaking everything
to his blasted cook.”
The inspector murmured:
“A boy named Gideon, about
nineteen, not long from
Moresby. Well, the Bulolojll
be in in a few minutes. I’m
going down to see her dock.
Coming?”
Grabbing his cap, the inspec-
tor said as he passed the police-
men at their desks: “I’m just
going down to the wharf. Shan’t
be long.” •
"C very six weeks the big
island - vessel calls at
Samarai on her run from Aus-
tralia. As usual the wharf was
packed. Some families were
returning from leave and others
were going away. Most of the
rest of the population found
occasion to be there, to see
people off, to meet old friends,
to gather for drinks on the cool
and spacious after-deck.
The wharf was busy with the
comings and goings of trucks,
teams of grimy stevedores,
raucous with shouts from
above and below and whistles
as the cargo-nets swung their
loads from the spider-legged
booms. A peppering of pale
and brightly-clad tourists
bobbed eagerly round the
sellers of native wares.
As he strolled through the
ordered confusion, Mackenzie
found an enormous figure
blocking his path. The man,
dressed only in a ragged old
pink rami, strangely secured
by a broad leather belt, thrust
a double-armful of grass-
skirts, beach-shells and pan-
danus-work, hand-bags and
mats firmly under the nose of
the trim khaki-clad inspector.
“What do you think you’re
doing?” exclaimed Mackenzie.
“I want you,” replied the
hawker, looking down at him
with a peculiarly intense stare,
“to come over here a little by
the Customs shed and see
all these somethings I have to
sell.”
While he was talking the man
started to move. Gently but
irresistibly the inspector found
himself urged in the desired
direction. As they went he
wondered why a grown man
should be selling curios,
usually the province of mis-
sion schoolboys and girls. He
also noted that while he had
spoken in Motu, the lingua
franca of the south, the big
man had replied in pidgin, the
northern language.
“Why do you do this?” asked
the inspector calmly. “And
why is a strong man like you
selling skirts and mats?”
“I am not a businessman,”
said the hawker, and his face
split in an infectious grin. “I
am Ulilio.”
“Oh. . .” returned the inspec-
tor flatly. “Who is Ulilio?”
The big man’s face fell. He
was plainly surprised and hurt.
“Ulilio,” he whispered. Ser-
geant Ulilio. The big Police-
master at Rabaul sent me to
find these men no good.”
“Oh,” said the inspector,
embarrassed by the man’s
obvious disappointment.
“How could I know? The plain
clothes tricked me!”
‘I only wanted to tell you
I am here. If you have orders
for me, Corporal Bororo will
find me.”
Mackenzie looked again at
the massive chest and took in
the disciplined carriage and
easy movement. Ulilio’s dis-
guise as a mission schoolboy
was wildly improbable, and the
policeman’s faith in his scheme
began to disappear. Ulilio
seemed a poor choice.
“AH right, sergeant, carry
on. I must go back to the
boat now.”
The big man leaned forward
with an urgent whisper: “You
can’t go yet. People have seen
us talking and you have bought
nothing. Buy this grass skirt.”
The inspector recoiled at the
thought of a uniformed-officer
and an old-timer at that carry-
ing a grass skirt in public.
No!” he said hastily.
“Give me something small.
That table-mat will do. Can
you change this pound?”
“I am sorry, sir,” said the
disguised sergeant disarmingly,
as the note was firmly tucked
behind the leather belt. “That
is my best mat and the price
is one pound!”
Walking back along the
wharf with the garish-colored
mat tightly rolled in one hand,
Mackenzie subdued his just
anger at being bilked out of at
least 15s. with the thought that
he might have underestimated
Ulilio.
Ulilio entered into the
spirit of hawking with zest.
His personality and salesman-
ship were such that his stock
was sold at grossly inflated
prices. Even then, camera-
spangled tourists eagerly photo-
graphed him in various poses,
which he was prepared to hold
indefinitely for a small con-
sideration.
T Julio’s successful selling
had been observed by
many local people, among
them one Gideon, a well-
dressed and plausible youth;
like Ulilio, a foreigner to
Samarai. He explained to
Ulilio that he came from the
village of Hanuabada, near
Port Moresby, and worked in
Samarai as a cook. Today he
had made the Bulolo’s arrival
an excuse for leaving his
employer a cold meal.
Gideon said he was sorry
he couldn’t take Ulilio to meet
his friends in Samarai, but
these were city men and well-
educated. They played cards
in the evening, while Ulilio, he
suggested, from his stumbling

use of the Motu language,
must be a bushman.
“Cards! ” Ulilio showed
both interest and disappoint-
ment. “I’ve always wanted to
learn. I have played Lucky
a little. Do you think they
could teach me?”
“We could try.” Gideon
looked as dubious as a man
could when his heart was sing-
ing. “Come with me. I’ll
show you an old house. Then
I must go. You come back
there at ten o’clock tonight.”
This suited Ulilio well, as it
gave him time for a secret con-
ference with Bororo.
/”Vnce again Corporal Bororo
and his men lay hidden in
the bushes, but this night his
heart was at rest. The big
sergeant from the north was
one of the party in the hut and
Bororo waited calmly for the
agreed signal.
Inside, the two professional
gamblers were big-eyed with
amazement.
This big bushman, after one
or two mistakes natural enough
in a learner, seemed to have
more than the traditional
beginner’s luck. It wasn’t that
he won all the time, but
he won the big pots. When
the stakes had been doubled
and re-doubled he would
innocently ask, “Is this ace
the right card to play?”
A puzzled Gideon watched
enviously as a big brown hand
once again scooped up the
money from the table and
tucked it behind a broad
leather belt. Gideon had not
lost much, but he had lost all
he had. He was only there to
make a fourth. His job was to
bring the pigeons to the pluck-
ing. He was wondering when
the professionals would really
set to work when the big man
rose to his feet.
“Thank you too much for
schooling me. Your money is
finished and I must go now.”
“Wait, wait,” groaned the
leader of the gamblers. “It’s
true that you have all out-
money now, but you must let
us try some more. We will
bet with this watch and that
shirt.”
“All right,” agreed Ulilio.
“We can try some more. That
is a nice watch, but first I
must go to the small house.”
No sooner had he slammed
the back door noisily behind
him than the professionals
leaned close across the table
to plan new tactics.
Hardly had they started when
their cockie’s sharp whistle was
followed by a shout of “Kara-
haraga!”
One man switched off the
light and they flung themselves
at the backdoor, to find it
bolted from outside, with some
heavy weight against it.
Corporal Bororo and four
men rushed in at the other door
and grabbed the gamblers.
“You —you’ve been playing
cards for money! What’s your
name?”
“Cards, corporal Yes, we
have been playing cards, but
we are poor men and we have
no money. Look”—and he
confidently pulled out the
empty pockets of his shorts—
“.there’s no money here at all! ”
After all the planning and
sleepless nights, Bororo
was furious at being cheated of
his victory. “You wait here,”
he snarled, “my officer will be
here soon and this talk is for
him.”
As the inspector approached
the hut, a dark form drifted out
of the shadows: “Psst! Police-
master!”
“Hullo, Ulilio! Has Bororo
got them?”
“Yes,” whispered Ulilio,
“Bororo is holding them, but
things are not the same. I am
sprry too much, but they have
lost all their money and so we
can’t court them for gambling.”
“Blast!” exclaimed Macken-
zie. “We’ve been working for
weeks and now we’ve got them
they have no money! ”
“True, sir, but I was taught
that the law is the same every-
where. In Rabaul town, when
we find a man with no money
and no job we put him in
jail.”
Mackenzie grinned in the
darkness and strode towards
the hut. Inside, Bororo
glowered at the three gamblers,
who, full of injured innocence,
stood against one wall.
“Well, Bororo, so these men
were playing cards, and here
are the cards, but no one has

any money . . . Yes, Bororo,
but have they jobs?”
The youngest player jumped
forward happily.
“Oh, yes, I know you,
Gideon. You can go. Now,
you two, where do you work?”
After they had been arrested,
Mackenzie took off his cap, and
unbuttoning his epaulettes,
slipped his badges of rank off
and tossed them into the cap.
“Very- nice work, Bororo,”
he congratulated the corporal.
“Take these back to the station.
I'm going to the club.”
'T'hrough the smoke and the
noise of the club Macken-
zie immediately spotted the
district-officer playing billiards.
Collecting a drink en route, he
strolled over and took him
aside.
“Well, we’ve got them, Bill.
I’ve just come from the raid
and they're pros, all right, from
Moresby. Funny thing,, they
had no money, but it doesn’t
matter —we’ve got them cold as
vagrants.”
“That’s good,” mused Sum-
mers; “have you any idea what
happened to the money?”
“Not for certain,” replied
Mackenzie, avoiding his eye,
“but the plainclothes-man, one
Sergeant Ulilio, leaves by the
first available transport.”
The next morning found
Bill Summers behind his file-
littered desk as usual. Again
the visitor’s chair was occupied
by the skinny figure of the
clergyman, who was saying:
“I’ve had another letter from
his Lordship, stating that he is
extremely vexed by the pre-
valence of organised gambling
and asking me to report regu-
larly to him. Is anything being
done?”
“I am happy to be able to
report that it’s all wrapped-up,
padre, and the credit should go
to Inspector Mackenzie. He
imported . a plainclothes-man,
who got into the school. Last
night the police were able to
raid them. The two men
arrested have been identified as
professional gamblers from
Port Moresby. Amazingly they
had no money, but since they
are not employed here they’ve
been charged with vagrancy; so
that’s that!”
“Two men arrested, you say,
and the plainclothes-man makes
three. I understand it takes
four to play ‘Lucky.’ ”
“Yes, there was a fourth.”
Summers looked down at his
writing-pad to hide the glint
in his eyes: “A man called
Gideon. He wasn’t arrested.
He was the urger who brought
the suckers in, but he wasn’t
a vagrant —I’m afraid he’s your
cook!”
Without a word, the clergy-
man got up and left, closing
the office-door more loudly
than was necessary.
“ . . . and I hope,” thought
Summers, to himself as he
reached for the next file, “that
you tell that to the Bishop,
too!”

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
N.Z.’s problem is how to
make use of the Welfare State
amidst the particular problems,
many of them economic, of the
present day. Theoretically, the
Welfare State should release
energies and abilities for ends
which will ennoble and develop
society as a whole rather than
induce the lethargic, unhappy
State which holds sway at the
moment.
Power at present is in the
hands of those who find it an
embarrassment. With little
direction or guidance, and even
positive obstruction, . coming
from above, the paralysis,
which is partly caused by the
New Zealand Attitudes
I feel that David Ausubel’s
The Fern and Tiki —an un-
fortunate title for a piece of
severe social analysis—is a
more important book than Pat
Lawlor has indicated (Red
Page 13/4/’6O). Admittedly it
is in some respects intemper-
ate and, read as a whole, could
be oppressive. But it is the
first time New Zealand society
has ever been examined in
such a way, and the strength
of the book lies in the valuable
insights with which it is strewn.
To Ausubel, N.Z. is an ad-
vanced Welfare State with an
essentially mid-Victorian social
ideology, and he takes pains to
show this relationship at work
in various spheres.
Several important institu-
tions, such as the secondary
schools, also embody mid-Vic-
torian ideals, and Ausubel’s
statements about the import-
ance of the doctrine of Original
Sin in the handling of the
young in N.Z. touch on one of
the most negative aspects of
N.Z. life and its gravely puni-
tive character.
Ausubel may be charged with
failing to suggest a remedy and
with allowing his argument to
peter-out and lapse into com-
fortable American social-
science jargon; but in some
parts of the book a direction
is indicated.
The secondary schools could
be a potential instrument for
cultural change and social
amendment. Many institu-
tions, such as the Chamber of
Commerce, might adopt a more
effective social credo than their
present one of social poise and
likeableness; the Plun k e t
Society needs to be over-
hauled.
Ausubel shows how the
present structure of conformity
is upheld by the newspapers
and by many State-run organi-
sations, so that responsible and
independent thinking is dis-
couraged at every level.
“And, furthermore , I'm getting a crick in the back from
booking you blokes in THESE things!”
fossilisation of ideas, spreads
downwards.
It is not the Welfare State
which is the villain. Those in
charge of it don’t know what
to do with it. N.Z. has become
a comfortable club whose mem-
bership-demands are not too
high. But there is nothing to
say that eventually the Estab-
lishment will not come under
new management. —J. M.
Thomson (N.S.W.).
“Airline Trouble”
A pity the Canberra con-
tributor of “Airline Trouble”
(B. 6/ 4 / ’6O) should have
merely followed the daily press.
The decision that both
T.A.A. and Ansett - A.N.A.
should buy Electra aircraft
must have been, in the final
event, a Federal Government
decision. Way back, before
Ansett ever thought of buying
A.N.A., he had placed firm
orders for two Electras with
options on two more. This was
when the aircraft was only on
the Lockheed drawing-boards.
To support the orders a sub-
stantial deposit was required
and paid.
Subsequently the Federal
Government saw fit to buy a
fleet of Lockheed Hercules air-
craft to re-equip the R.A.A.F.
transport-command. It’s im-
portant to realise that in these
two types of aircraft from the
same stable many parts —par-
ticularly engine-parts—are in-
terchangeable.
With the Electra flying, and
proved as a new conception of
airliner, the Federal Govern-
ment ordered a fleet for
Qantas and, overruling the
New Zealand Government’s
desire for Comet 4’s for TEAL,
ordered Electras for that line
also.
That the Comet was ideally
suited to this type of operation
must be appreciated to see the
overall picture emerging; and
the picture must be viewed
through the eyes of a Govern-
ment with limited funds for
defence, and still remembering
the chaos caused through try-
ing to operate armed forces
equipped with dozens of dif-
ferent types of aircraft, trucks
and so on.
T.A.A.’s request for Cara-
velles now must be viewed in
this light—quite apart from the
fact that the economical opera-
tion of pure-jet aircraft as
opposed to turbo-prop aircraft
is not yet possible on short-
haul work, which comprises
the greater part of the domestic
airline-system. It is obviously
impractical to buy expensive
aircraft to specialise on certain
routes, such as the Melbourne-
Perth run, at this stage of the
country’s development.
The Canberra writer com-
ments that Ansett, when com-
paring the two airlines, “omits
from his letter, however, that
his company has had £9 million
of Government bac k i n g.”
Where he got these figures
from is a complete mystery;
the Government has never at
any time given any financial
backing to Ansett or Ansett-
A.N.A.
The true picture is that in
the recent re-equipment of the
airline, since the purchases are
from the dollar-area, inter-
national monetary requirements
make it necessary for such
sums to be guaranteed by the
Government. In the event of
financial failure, and the con-
sequent inability of Ansett to
pay for his aircraft, then, and
only then, would the Govern-
ment come into the picture.
So instead of two Govern-
ment-subsidised airlines, as
claimed, we have only one.
Ansett-A.N.A. is entirely
financed from small share-
holders in Australia, such as
the present writer. It is in
competition with a Govern-
ment department which still
retains thousands of miles of
air-routes in the Common-
wealth in a monopoly hold.
Nobody can operate these
routes in competition without
the permission of the Minister
of Civil Aviation. Ansett-
A.N.A cannot operate any
route or service without dupli-
cation by T.A.A.—as in the
case of New Guinea, where
Ansett filed his application to
operate many years ago, before
the takeover of A.N.A. He
was refused, but it did at least
have the salutary effect of per-
suading Qantas to operate
pressurised modern aircraft
on that route, in place of the

Food for Peace
Six years ago Father Ken-
nedy Ttlcker, Superior of the
Anglican Brotherhood of St.
Lawrence, extended his welfare
work for the aged and needy
to Asia’s starving millions in
his Food for Peace campaign.
In that short time, as the
initial handful of supporters
increased, his scheme has con-
tributed £A7OOO to Asian relief.
Small as this is in comparison
with the enormous need, it has
had value far beyond what the
actual money indicates, for
preference has been given to
self-help projects of health- and
food-promotion.
The Swiss liaison-officer for
the scheme, M. Pierre Oppliger,
reports from India that benefits
provided include a water-supply
for a village hospital in Nepal;
vitamin-tablets for the patients;
part-payment for the X-ray
plant so needed among the
undernourished, T.B. -prone
population; powdered-milk for
village school - children; sup-
plements to the scant, meatless,
starchy diet and daily glass of
milk upon which youths in a
voluntary work-camp had been
subsisting; assistance ✓to the
Y.M.C.A. in providing homes,
care and education for India’s
enormous army of homeless
boys; free treatment for in-
digent patients at Vellore
Hospital in South India; and
food and equipment for the
Laksnmi Ashram girls’-school
in northern India.
Help has also been given to
a group of trained Australian
graduates who, living and work-
ing among Indonesians, are
training young people there to
grapple with the many prob-
lems of new nationhood.
Here, says Father Tucker, is
Australia’s opportunity to help
less-fortunate neighbors, and to
fight as energetically for peace
as through two wars. His
Food for Peace campaign, he
firmly believes, “is the pattern,
plan and the priceless in-
gredient of a positive way to
peace.”—M’Lou (Vic.).
Pensions and Insurance
“Farinmail’s” view that a
national-insurance scheme is
the proper remedy for the
present problem of fairly ad-
ministering the old-age pension
(B. 13/4/’6O) is one I’ve heard
expressed by many other
people.
Such a scheme was actually
prepared in 1938, and although
in the first stages it dealt with
old-age pensions only, it could
have been expanded into more
comprehensive terms.
The 1938 scheme was
shelved, and I don't know what
has happened to it; but I
remember the terrific political
opposition it received.
Had the scheme matured, the
funds which would have
accumulated can be imagined ;
but, more important, many
pensioners on the present
scheme would have been re-
ceiving pay under the 1938
scheme, whilst the number of
older members would be
dwindling towards vanishing-
point.
I had some experience with
the 1938 scheme, and I’m con-
vinced that, with modifications
suitable to the times, it could
and should be reintroduced to
ensure that the rising genera-
tion will eventually receive a
pension free of political interest
or interference.
The present system is stupid
and wasteful; it is also unfair
to pensioners and the nation. —
Tatch (N.S.W.).
Tell “Farinmail” there aren’t
very many people about today
“who made their [sufficient]
money in the days of low
taxation” and who don’t need
the old-age pension. The system
of high taxation has prevailed
for a long time now and will
last for a long time yet.
The cessation of the means-
»test would not “impose a heavy
burden on the working popu-
lation.” Here is one of that
group who’d consider it some-
thing from Heaven.
The means-test is a tremend-
ous deterrent to saving. In
this tourist - area of North
Queensland we daily see and
talk with many elderly caravan-
ning couples, a 11 declaring
frankly that they are dissipat-
ing their savings for two
reasons: first, to qualify for
the pension; second, because
the death-duties would other-
wise get them anyhow.
These people point out that
in the U.K. the means-test
ceases to apply at age 70; that
in some countries it doesn't
apply at all; and that even in
Australia it doesn’t apply to
some groups—for example, the
blind.
“Farinmail’s” argument that
unemploymen t-pay is not
drawn by the employed is no


more relevant than its opposite
—that both the maternity-
bonus and child-endowment
are not subject to a means-test.
“Farinmail” can draw his
fire-insurance, without a test,
any time his house is burnt-
down; and he ought to be able
to draw his pension any time
after reaching his 65th birth-
day. — Benbow (Q.).
“Farinmail’s” arguments not-
withstanding, I am proud to
number myself among the three
out of every four Australians
who think that the means-test
should be abolished.
I’m told that many, if not
the majority, of members of
the House of Representatives
hold views similar to those
voiced through the latest Gal-
lup -Poll, but the financial ad-
visers to the Government main-
tain that the country can’t
afford the cost. To my mind
this is sheer balderdash.
Perusal of the Federal Bud-
get for any of the last few years
will show that a not-inconsider-
able proportion of revenue
collected from taxpayers is
spent on capital-works which
should rightly be financed out
of loan-money. On this point
Federal Treasurers both present
and past apparently agree, but
they state that loan-money is
not available. Why? Because
insufficient inducements are
held-out to investors to sub-
scribe to Commonwealth loans.
For instance, why has Aus-
tralia been offering English
and American investors over 5y
per cent, on their money while
the local investor is offered only
5 per cent?
I maintain that if interest-
rates on Commonwealth loans
were raised and/or they were ,
made more attractive in other
directions a very much larger
"I think he's getting that seventy-year itch."
proportion of the cost of
capital-works could be financed
by loan-money, thus freeing
more than enough revenue to
meet the cost of abolishing the
means-test. —F. E. Bland
(N.S.W.).
South Africa
The present problems of
South Africa are not likely to
be solved by answering the
question who was there first —•
Bantu or whitemen. However,
“D. Empson” is surely wrong
when he tells us that the an-
cestors of the whites in South
Africa “were there before the
Bantu came down from Central
Africa” (B. 20/4/’6O).
Perhaps it all depends on
what you mean by “Bantu” and
“South Africa.” I understand
“Bantu” to mean members of
those tribes in Africa all of
whom speak much the same
language—Bantu (coming from
their word “abantu,” meaning
“people”). And “South Africa,”
I suppose, means that part of
Africa south of the Zambesi,
or at least, that part now in-
cluded in the Union.
When the Dutch established
the first white settlement in
South Africa in 1652 they came
into contact with two native
groups—the Hottentots and a
diminutive race they called
“Bushmen.” Both were yellow-
skinned and weak, and the
Dutch were able to subdue
them without much trouble.
Land was bought from them
with “tobacco, beads, brandy,
bread and other trifles,” and
they were forced into slavery
by the Dutch. The population
of the Capetown settlement in
1714 was given as 988 “free”
adults and 1418 slaves.
The Bantu were a much more
aggressive people, particularly
when their land was threatened
by an invader who believed
that God had ordained that the
blackman should serve the
whiteman as a slave.
At the time of the first white
settlement the Bantu were to be
found in South Africa, between
the Drakensberg Mountains
and the Indian Ocean. Here
lived both the military Bantu
(Zulus, Matabele, Kaffir, etc.)
and the more peaceful Bantu
(Mashonas, Bechuanas, etc.).
Gradually the white settle-
ment expanded eastwards to-
wards the Bantu territory until
by 1778 whites were in the
vicinity of the Great Fish
River, 450 miles east of Cape-
town. In that year Governor
Van Flattenberg, after a con-
ference with one tribe, agreed
that this river should be fixed
as the boundary between the
Europeans and the Bantu. —

DAIRY ECONOMICS
By R. A. PRICE
HR uddigore ” does well to em-
phasise (B. 23/ 3/ ’6O) that
many dairyfarmers are in strife
because of small farms and
ever-rising costs. But I believe
the number ,of completely
hopeless farms is small—per-
A grazier’s wool-clip is
of vital concern not
only to the grazier
himself but also to
every thinking Austra-
lian. Very little thought
is required to realise
that our n a t i o n's
economy and future
prosperity is linked
with her primary indus-
tries. It is therefore
gratifying to note ■ that
wool prices generally
are maintaining, and in
fact increasing their
high level. Also of
concern to every grazier
would be a too high
lamb mortality rate,
since every lamb lost
means decreased pro-
duction. The Elastrator
Rubber Ring method
of Castration and Tail-
ing considerably reduces
the risk of fly-strike
because Elastrator
Rubber Rings leave no
open wounds. Without
doubt Elastrator
Rubber Rings provide
the safest, surest and
most humane method
of Castrating and
Tailing your lambs.
haps much smaller than the
number'of discouraged farmers.
Wrung-out farms in unsuit-
able -districts would be better
closed-down—not kept going
by subsidies. But subsidies are
sound if they tide industries
over temporary setbacks like
establishment-costs, or keep
them going for their national
value, and if the high cost is
spread over all those who
benefit.
In other words, the granting
of subsidies presupposes that
expense will be justified in the
future, when conditions change.
A subsidy should work as an
investment to allow an in-
dustry to improve itself until
it is efficient and self-support-
ing. If there is no real chance
of improvement, there’s no
point in applying a subsidy or
investing any more money.
If a farmer cannot plant
five acres of a mixed, legume-
rich pasture —such as sub-
clover and ryegrass or lucerne
and Rhodes-grass—at a cost of
less than £4O, then the farm
must be in a bad way! If the
farmer is not aware of the
merit of such a planting, then
our general education and agri-
cultural extension-services are
at a pretty low ebb!
Depending on the value of
milk, the rainfall, the quality
of the cows and the quality or
otherwise of the grazing-pro-
gramme, the return from five
acres would be £6O to £l5O
better than from native grasses,
and this would go on for five
years or so,_ with an annual
fertiliser-cost of £5.
The increased return gives a
margin for further develop-
ment of pastures, and 30 acres
of improved pastures, on a six-
year rotation, should make
even a small farm more hope-
ful. After five years of pasture
the odd year can be used to
gather a cash-crop or a fodder-
crop for ensilage, grain or hay.
Once a man gets good pastures
established, which the cows,
harvest mainly for themselves,
he finds his costs falling and
his income rising, but one of
the best results of the grazing
of legume-pastures is the im-
provement in soil-fertility. A
year of cropping will show this,
as 1 well as giving increased
health and production to the
pastures themselves.
The other main condition
for success is that the cows
must be able to respond to
better feeding. Culling must
be heavy and based on produc-
tion-figures. It is a cardinal
error to put on more cows than
the feed can fill to capacity or
the man can handle satisfac-
torily. On far too many farms
the number of cows could be
reduced by at least a third —the
worst third—and an increase in
net income would result.
Lately “Hoard's Dairyman”
(U.S.A.) gave some figures
which illustrate this. R. C.
Hoglund, agricultural econo-
mist at Michigan State Univer-
sity, calculated that a dairyman
with average cows, doing an
average job, can double his
net income by improving the
quality of his cows, by adopt-
ing the best (feed) production-
practices and by possibly add-
ing a few more cows to use the
extra feed that might be pro-
duced. But changing to a
larger farm with more cows
has a relatively small effect on
net income when average cows
and average production-
methods are used:
A dairyman with 25 cows each
producing 10,0001 b. milk a year,
using average. forage-production
practices, can increase his net
income by about 1100 dollars
[£soo] a year- by adopting improved
forage-methods. Merely expand-
ing to a 48-cow herd, without
improvement in forage-quality,
would add only 400 dollars [£lBo]
to the net income. Higher invest-
ments and expenses such as hired
labor eat-up nearly all the increased
gross income. Where forage is
of equal quality, the net income
from 25 cows each producing
13,0001 b. milk a- year is greater
than that from 48 cows each pro-
ducing 10,0001 b. a year.
The keywords are “quality”
of feed and stock and “net in-
come” to the farmer. By
“quality” in feed is meant a
mixed pasture rich in legumes,
which is grazed or cut when
protein-content is at its highest
—when only a tenth of the
plants are in bloom. “Net in-
come” is the money finally,
available to the farmer as in-
terest on his investment and
payment for his own labor and
management, after all produc-
tion-costs have been met. This
is the figure that counts—not
the size of the farm or the
number of cows on it.
About Bloat
“J.H.S.”: I read Dr. Whittle-
stone’s ideas about bloat (B.
13/4/'6O) with interest, but
can't help feeling that a lot of
fuss is made about a problem
quite easily handled by any
farmer who really lives with
his cows.
For years our pasture around
Penrith (N.S.W.) has been an
excellent producer of bloat

from September until the end
of May each year. I have
found that however much rye,
phalaris or paspalum I have
with the clover, certain cows
go for the clover and bloat
daily, sometimes twice a day.
If I arrive at the dairy in
the morning to find 10 per
cent, or more of the herd
somewhat swollen I just push
all those affected into the
feeders, where they eat their
normal ration of dry feed. I
milk those that are not bloated,
then put them in their turn to
eat their ration of dry feed.
By the time the bloaters have
finished their feed the others
have been milked and fed.
The bloaters have by then
subsided, are milked and go
out, sometimes to bloat again
in the afternoon.
I find, too, that by admitting
the herd to the feeders from
1.30 p.m. to 1.45 p.m. any
that are bloated subside after
eating their feed. If, as some-
times happens, I am delayed
by the telephone or visitors
and get to the dairy later than
1.45 p.m. I give a dose of
Anti-Foamal down the throat
of the odd cow that feels too
uncomfortable to eat, and all
is well again.
Before I learned to handle
bloat the practical way I used
a troacha and canula. Once
was enough—the cow died of
peritonitis. I then tried my
method of dry feed with Anti-
Foamal for the odd one too
far gone, and have never
worried since. Theorists say:
“Cull the bloaters,” “Spray
the pastures with r oil,” etc.
But I have founcl that the
bloaters are among my best
producers, and no practical
farmer can afford to cull them,
any more than he can afford
the plant and expense of spray-
ing pasture when it is not really
necessary. I have found that
to produce milk profitably
here, which I have done for
about- 12 years, cows must
always have dry feed twice
daily, its quantity and quality
with the state of the
'pasture.
New
Sheep-marking Tag
“Myall”: An improved plas-
tic ear-tag for marking and
identifying sheep has been in-
vented by C L. Rockford, of
Dunkeld (Vic.), who has named
his brainchild Studmaster.
The tag is an arrow-shaped,
round-edged stud, which won't
change position or catch on
fencing or other obstructions.
The tapered nose makes normal
shearing possible without loss
of time, and there’s no risk of
infection to the ear.
To give wide scope for data
the tags come in a range of
20 colors, with numerical mark-
ings of 1 to 100 and upwards.
The base of the tag can carry
any property-markings, a differ-
ent color can be used for each
year of drop, and tagging in
the right or left ear can define
sex.
Colors can also represent
pasture-tests, wool-tests, pad-
dock-rotation and family-strain,
and help in other tests. The
tag is color-fast, durable, and
light enough to prevent, a
ewe's ear dropping when in
lamb.
Length of the tag—l-in. be-
tween inside edges—allows for
a natural lanoline build-up
between ear and tag-faces and
permits free circulation, which
in turn eliminates the risk of
dermatitis forming round the
area.
The tag cannot be removed
from position without damag-
ing the ear, will remain clean,
can easily be seen during draft-
ing, and readily establishes
ownership in mixed flocks.
And fitting it on is very easy.
Soil Conservation
In B. 30/3/’6O a statement in
an article of mine was subbed
to read:
I have had the opportunity of
studying some of these methods
[of the Soil Conservation service]
over the past five or six years; in
my opinion they have proved
completely useless.
What I wrote was:
I have had the opportunity of
studying some of these methods,
over the past five or six years here,
notably some contour banks on a
property in West Brookton area.
In my opinion they have proved
completely useless, and I am pre-
pared to demonstrate why I think
so, after five years of watching
them.
Thus, I did not say, as the sub-
editing seems to me to suggest,
that Soil Conservation methods
were (all) completely useless.

School Project
“Ailsey”: Bega (N.S.W.)
High School has made history
by starting its own small farm
in conjunction with its course
in agriculture.
A dairy-herd is being estab-
lished with a top-quality heifer
from each principal breed,
objective being the studying
of yields and quality. One
heifer lately won the over-six-
months and under-12-months
class in the open Guernsey
section at Bega Show. This
calf was a gift from the famous
Bodalla Estate.
The school hopes to insti-
tute a fourth-year course next
year to help students who
intend to take-up farming
when they leave school.

buyers in the future of the
Australian beef-cattle industry
was proved by the purchases
they made, selecting the tops
of the excellent catalogue and
bidding undeterred for what-
ever they wanted. But these
bids were eclipsed when Fairy
Mead Sugar Co. took Milton
Olympic 2nd for 7500gns. and
earlier in the sale when Milton
Fantasia 3rd was bought for
Dalgety's, London, with a
December bull-calf at foot, for
4000gns.
Orchard Sanitation
“Fruit Cocky”: After a
heavy fruit-season, growers
don’t usually go round looking
for non-essential work: but
quite a number of tedious jobs,
often referred to as “orchard-
sanitation,” seem to come up
from this time on, and they
don’t always get the considera-
tion they deserve.
A measure often neglected in
stone-fruit blocks is destruction
of brown-rot “m umm i e s.”
These can often be seen still
hanging on the trees long after
harvest, and are the main
source of infection for follow-
ing seasons.
Scraping the butts of apple-
trees and pear-trees in search
of codling-moth grubs is not
generally necessary since the
advent of modern spray
methods. However, it still pays
to sample a few trees to investi-
gate the “catch,” and trees close
to packing-sheds (favorite tar-
gets for moth) should not be
missed. The shed and its con-
tents—particularly used fruit-
cases—are worth some atten-
tion, too, but rarely get it.
During pruning, when pow-
dery mildew is present, in-
fected shoots should always be
cut, and ought to be burned.
At this time also borers in
plums and cherries can be
attacked with a wire probe and
a squirt of D.D.T. concentrate;
carbon-bisulphide, or kerosene.
This doesn’t often get done,
unless you carry the necessary
gear around when pruning.
Perhaps the most important
advance in orchard-sanitation
will be when it ultimately be-
comes possible to control black-
spot of apple and pear with a
single operation in late autumn.
This may not be so very far
ahead. In recent years the
N.S.W. Department of Agricul-
ture has experimented with a
high concentration of phenyl-
mercuric-chloride in a spray
just before leaf-fail. The idea
is to kill-off the overwintering
fungus on the leaves, and so
do away with the following
season’s infection at its source.
In 1956 every apple-tree in one
small isolated orchard-district
was treated on these lines, with
most promising results.
There are two hurdles —cost
and the need for universal
adoption. What’s the use of
getting rid of your own black-
spot, just to have fresh spores
blow in from next-door?
Artificial Insemination
“Windy”: Investigations into
artificial insemination are
turning-up some startling
figures.
A large cause of loss to the
dairy-industry—calculated at
over £5 million —comes from
failed production, calves that
aren’t born and cattle which
have to be sold because they
won’t breed. This figure
doesn’t include the value of
time wasted and money spent
on “cures” that fail.
Contagious abortion was
once mainly responsible for
infertility. Thanks to Strain
19 vaccine, abortion has been
subdued in most dairy dis-
tricts. In Queensland, investi-
gations have shown that
vibriosis is now the most
common cause of shy breed-
ing and its attendant ailments.
This is spread by the bull.
A whole herd can be infected
before anyone recognises the
cause of the trouble. Although
antibiotics will stop vibrio,
once the disease appears in a
herd it spells strife in a \ big
way. A lot of time and money
will be spent before it is finally
cleaned-up.
This is where artificial
insemination comes in. At
several centres in Queensland
artificial-insemination stations
have been established, where
bulls are kept under the closest
supervision. Consequently, any
semen coming from these
centres can be unconditionally
guaranteed to be absolutely
free from disease.
Results in these districts
have been most encouraging.
Artificially-inseminated cows
have conceived quicker and
the rate of shy breeding has
greatly declined. Even cows
that had been difficult to get
into calf before have been
successfully inseminated.
It will, however, be some
time before every district has
artificial insemination.
First, there’s a shortage of
suitable bulls. It’s not enough
to have a disease-free animal;
you need one that will not
lower the production-standard
of herds. This means you must
use a bull of high production-
potential. Production - stan-
dards of all herds in a district
vary; some are low, others
very high. Consequently, while
a bull may satisfy 75 per cent,
of the herds as far as pro-
duction-potential is concerned,
it may not satisfy the other
25 per cent. And the higher
the production-potential sought
*the more difficult it is to get
bulls.
Secondly, the number of
skilled operators is limited.
Contrary to general belief, it
requires a skilled person to
make a success of the job and
save return-visits, which are
costly and waste time. The
REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(21/4/’60)
South-eastern Queensland shbuld have good rains
during May, heavy in the south-eastern districts and
moderate in the central highlands and along the Maranoa,
though elsewhere falls may be poor. The rains are likely
to continue in the eastern half of the State during June,
with flooding on the coast south of Mackay.
N.S.W. should have general rains during May, with
heaviest falls on the Central and South Coasts, on the
Southern Tablelands and part of the South-west Slopes, and
in the central-western districts. Serious flooding is likely
in the eastern half of the State. The rains should continue
in June, with possible flooding ih the central and southern
divisions.
Victoria should also have general rains during May,
with heaviest falls in the west-coast districts and in East
Gippsland. Patchy rains should follow, with general rains
again in September.
In the agricultural areas and along the west coast of
South Australia rainfall should be good in May, although
falls may be poor in the interior. There will probably be
patchy rains in June, with good falls in Jul^.
Moderate rains are likely in the agricultural areas of
Western Australia during May, with good falls about the
Fortescue and West Gascoyne. Around Eucla and in the
north-east falls should be moderate, but elsewhere they are
likely to be poor.

Department of Agriculture
bull-proving in Queensland
has shown the worth of arti-
ficial insemination ; indeed,
Queensland results have been
more than comparable with
those obtained in overseas
countries which have been
working on the problem much
longer than Australia.
The theoretical problems
have just about been ironed-
out, but there are still some
practical ones that cause head-
aches. One of the biggest is
to decide when a cow is really
in season. This may sound
strange, but many farmers
have been tricked by a cow's
behavior and thought it was
ready for the inseminator when
it was not. Then it is necessary
to decide which is the best
time to inseminate. When the
cow is coming on? At the
height of season? Or when
the cow is going off? Farmers
have to be trained to keep
accurate observations about
these things, otherwise they
may find the game expensive.
There are other problems
gradually being sorted-out.
Chilling the semen will allow
it to be kept for several days
—long enough to get it to
most farms, and investigations
have proved that, if you have
a really valuable bull and want
to keep semen for some par-
ticular purpose, deep-freezing
will preserve the live sperms
for several months. This is
important when importing
semen from another State.
If it’s doing nothing else,
artificial insemination is get-
ting farmers more interested
in keeping records about the
breeding-habits of their cows.
This will stimulate an added
interest in herd-testing which
is the basis of all herd-
improvement.
The Chisel-plough
“Aerogenes”: I back what
P. A. Yeomans (B. 30/3/’6O)
claims for the chisel-plough.
On shale and clay soils, with
the mouldboard-plough we
used to bring up a little clay
each ploughing, which had to
be weathered and converted to
topsoil, thus increasing the top-
soil depth.
Now we use a disk-cultivator
for the top layer and a chisel-
plough for breakingmp the
clay beneath; Not only does
the soil take in moisture in
large quantities, but it also
gives it out more freely, due to
better penetration by the roots
as the topsoil “grows” down-
wards.
Whatever the state of the
surface, we disk first, so
that the chisel-plough will go
deeper, but this might be too
loosening for a light soil.
“Tillage'’: I have just been
looking at some chisel-ploughs
at our local Show, and I would
still like to know what real
difference there is between these
implements and those we used
to call “scarifiers” or some-
times “grubbers.”
These, like the chisel-plough,
tore the ground with narrow
tines, but did not turn it, as
does a mouldboard or disk.
They were made in various
types —rigid, spring-tooth, and
some stump-jump. Some were
strong enough to rip the ground
to as great a depth as anything
used today, though most were
intended for shallower work.
Vertical Mulching
“Eaude”: In wet seasons the
number of peach-trees which
die of waterlogging is a serious
problem around Shepparton
•(Vic.) Here the main soil-type
is about Bin. of light sandy
loam separated by a clay sub-
soil up to 2ft. thick from the
underlying sandy-clay loam,
which is more permeable.
Ripping through the clay
gives temporarily improved
drainage, but heavy rain or
irrigation soon washes back
clay-particles to block the
drainage-cracks ripped through
the subsoil.
The Horticultural Research
Station at Tatura has been
experimenting with vertical
mulching to find some long-
lasting stabiliser to keep the
drainage-cracks open. In thjs,
Tatura follows the lead of
Purdue University (U.S.A.),
where in 1956 chopped crop-
residues blown into vertical
slots made by a subsoiler were
found to increase the infiltra-
tion and drainage-capacity of
soils.
Vertical mulching does more
than open the soil for drain-
age. It stimulates bacterial
action and greater root-growth,
which in turn helps towards a
more open soil-structure. The
combination of decaying
organic material with moisture
and air gives greater stimulus
to soil-bacteria, often extending
this stimulus beyond the ripped-
up area. Dry organic matter,
like straw, especially if a soil-
sterilant is added, gives longer
and more effective drainage.
Chemical stabilisers, like gyp-
sum, also keep the broken soil-
masses open and promote bac-
terial action,
At Tatura, straw, sawdust
(both with and without steri-
lant), gravel, gypsum, and
prunings are being tested as
stabilisers. The idea is to find
out which best prevents water-
logging in wet seasons; which
increases the permeability of
the subsoil most; and which, in
already loosened clay, best
promotes ro6t-growth for the
further opening of the soil.
Skeleton-weed
“Wimra”: Though the Vic-
torian Lands Department has
controlled all known areas of
skeleton-weed throughout the
Wimmera wheatbelt, new areas
of infestation are being dis-
covered as press and radio pub-
licity makes more farmers
aware of the menace to their
districts.
To help the department in its
campaign individual land-
holders should find out what
skel e t o n-weed looks like,
promptly notify the department
when they find any of it, and
co-operate in all efforts to get
rid of it. At present, when the
weed is already seeding, the
department's enforcement of
the Vermin and Noxious Weeds
Act comes too late for effective
control of new areas this
season, which means greater
difficulty in coping with next!
season’s prolific growth.
There is, too, a disquieting?
suspicion, amounting to prac-
tical certainty, that skeleton-
weed is being introduced and
widely spread through uncertU
fied clover-seeds from N.S.W.
The department may have to
insist more stringently that
only certified seed be sown in
future.
Meanwhile, at the March
conference of the Victorian
Wheat and Wool Growers’
Association in Melbourne, West
Wimmera delegates pressed for
greater research, on a national
scale, to combat the skeleton-
weed menace. A Yaapeet dele-
gate advocated a Government
subsidy on the weedicides
needed.
Millet
“Jock”: Round about
Tumut-Gundagai they produce
about two-thirds of the millet
grown in N.S.W., and at £2OO
a ton it’s a good sort of crop.
Most of the growers are
“small” men; areas average 20
acres, with one or two farms
covering 110 acres.
A co-operative factory at
Tumut deals with 90 per cent,
of the harvest, turning out
some 8500 brooms a year.
This year about 90 per cent,
of the Tumut crop (recently
harvested) will be threshed,
cleaned, baled and seeded by a
machine imported from the
U.S. The pig and poultry in-
dustries mainly use the seed,
and lately it has been found
useful as sheep- fodder.

Information Sought
Instructions for drying mush-
rooms, and a recipe for mushroom-
ketchup ?
Mushrooms are difficult to dry
successfully, as they tend to liquefy
during the process. Remove stalks,
then place mushrooms in a strainer
and dip them quickly in and out
of boiling-water to kill pests and
moulds. Pat them as dry as
possible with a cloth, spread out
on white paper, and dry very
slowly in the oven at not more
than 150 deg. F. Pickling might
suit better: choose button-stage of
growth, wipe clean with a cloth
dipped in salt, set in a pan with
mace, salt and pepper, and as the
juice comes out, shake well. Let
them remain on the stove until
juice is absorbed again, cover with
vinegar, simmer slightly. When
nearly cold put into jars which
have been sterilised by heat, and
tie-down. For ketchup, wipe
mushrooms clean, place in layers
in an earthenware-dish with salt
between each layer, cover with a
damp cloth of several thicknesses,
stand in a warm place for 36 hours,
then mash and strain. To each
quart of juice add loz. pepper-
corns and boil for 30 minutes;
add loz. each of allspice, whole
cloves, -joz. crushed root-ginger, 1
blade of mace. Simmer for 15
minutes. When cold, strain and
bottle.

What gave rise to the passing of
the Statute of Westminster, and
did it affect the status of both
Dominions and Colonies ?
The Statute of Westminster was
passed in 1931 to give effect to
resolutions passed at the Imperial
"Don't take any notice of him — he's just going
through a stage!"
Conferences of 1926 and 1930, and
to the “Balfour Declaration” that
“they [Great Britain and the
Dominions] are autonomous com-
munities within the British Empire,
equal in status, in no way subordin-
ate one to another in any aspect
of their domestic and internal
affairs, though united by a common
allegiance to the Crown, and freely
associated as members of the
British Commonwealth of Nations.”
Its main provision was to render
the Colonial Laws Validity Act of
1805 inapplicable to statutes passed
by a Dominion legislature after 1931.
By the Act of 1865 any colonial
law is invalid to the extent to which
it is repugnant to any Act of
Parliament having reference to the
particular Colony; since 1931,
however, Dominion legislatures
have the power to amend or repeal
any such Act in so far as it is
part of the law of the Dominion.
No Act passed after 1931 by the
Parliament of the U.K. will be
deemed to extend to a Dominion
unless the Act specifically declares
that the Dominion has consented
to the enactment. Finally, the
Dominions are given full power to
make laws having extra-territorial
validity. The statute, didn’t affect
the status of the Colonies.

Abortive bid and weird convention.
Yet, flexible, he quickly learns
To play the systems that you mention.
Not for him: “A bid review, please ?”
Nor endless trance at bid or play.
When defending, he at once sees
What to save and throw away.
Always noting discards dropping:
Never missing clear “high-lows”;
If failing stoppers, always stopping
Short of clearly-doomed three-no’s.

With poise, employing every one.
No noisy choosing which to use
Or loathsome boasting what lie’s done.
Not inflating utter bust
With giddy psych, confusing all.
Not undermining partner’s trust
With misbegotten overeall.
Never leaping gaily gameward
When a partial will suffice.
Never nagging, bragging, lagging,
Never snarling, always nice.
This paragon of song and fable:
May his species flourish ever
Does he often join our table?
Never, never, never, never.

For those who favor the
larger forms there are two
symphonies as far apart as the
Poles in theme and treatment.
The bigger is the Sibelius Fifth.
Listeners who may have shied-
off the Finnish composer
through being exposed to his
icy-crags - and - chill -winds
Fourth and Seventh will find in
this H.M.V. disk (OALP
music which breathes rather
the warm air of s u m m e i
Bohemia than that of the gelid
far-north. It is full or rich
harmonies and has some note-
worthy melodies, and, like all
Sibelius’s music, has great
strength. To this is added a
rare cheerfulness and a rhyth-
mie buoyancy, and it is beauti-
fully played by the 8.8. C.
Orchestra under Sir Malcolm
Sargent. Tossed-in for good
measure on the reverse is “Poh-
jola’s Daughter,” which, rated
as a _ “symphonic fantasy,” is
really a tone-poem in which the
Finn, as in so many of his other
attractive essays in this medium,
draws on Nordic mythology
for his inspiration.
The other symphony is the
Tchaikowsky Fourth, a Coronet
pressing (KLC 2696), also on
mono. The first movement,
like Beethoven’s Fifth, is domi-
nated by a Fate-motif, but the
Russian here was no match for
the German; it is, in fact, one
of his weakest symphonic inspi-
rations. The other three move-
men(? are much more p | easing ,
and in this reading by the New
york philharmonic, with
Leonard Bernstein conducting,
there is some exquisite string
and woodwind playing, which
re aches its zenith in the Scherzo
( g j ven over largely to violins
playing pizzicato) with the
voices of the reeds having their
say
philips have released two out-
standing disks from Deutsche
Grammophon which will make
the mouths of any music-lover
watei% f or as we ll as being
played by a pianist of brilliant
attainments with an orchestra
w hj c h can hold its own with
most of Europe’s best, the
works c h oS en are (with the
possible exception of the “Em-
peror’’) the best-loved of all in
the p i an o-concerto literature.
They are t her Schumann A
Minor and the Rachmaninoff
Second. The keyboard - tone
con jured by Svjatoslav Richter
comes out with tinkling-crystal
sharpness, t h e phrasing is
superb and the collaboration
b y the orchestra (the Warsaw
philharmonic under Wislocki)
of the greatest refinement. The
Schumann has been contained
on one side, so that there is
room on the reverse for three
other popular numbers by the
same composer: the Introduc-
tion and Allegro Appassionata,
OP. 92; Toccata in C Major,
and the Novellette in F Major.
This disk is LPM 18597. No.
LPM 18596 is the Rachmani-
noff, with the second band of
the reverse side devoted to six
of the composers most appeal-
ing Preludes.
Previous attempts to put
sacred choral music on records
haven’t met with great success,
but Capitol has notched a
winner with a fine selection of
religious numbers g r o u p e d,
under the title of Holy, Holy,
Holy (P-8498), on mono. Sung
with great devotional fervor by
the Roger Wagner Chorale,
with singers and the Capitol
Symphony Orchestra directed
by Wagner, it includes an ex-
cerpt from Bach’s “St. John’s
Passion,” the well-known “Jesu,
Joy of Man's Desiring,” the
Bach - Gounod “Ave Maria,”
the stirring title-song and Sul-
livan’s “Onward Christian
Soldiers,” and “The Holy City ’
and “The Rosary.”
For Coronet Andre Kostela-
netz and his Orchestra give a
sparkling account of all the
infectious bohemian gaieties of
Offenbach’s Gaite Parisienne,
a potpourri of some of the
most tuneful airs wrought by
this greatest of the light-
operetta wits. Appropriately
the record’s reverse side is
Carmen Highlights, by Bizet,
who got his first start by
winning a competition for
operettas sponsored by the
same Offenbach. This attrac-
tive record is KLL 1616.
For Philips, George Szell and
the Concertgebouw Orchestra
of Amsterdam have put on a
45 r.p.m. excerpts from Schu-
bert’s Rosamunde (400 059
AE). It comprises the Entr’act’
music and the ballet-music, two
of Schubert’s most charming
contributions to the theatre.

Little Pops
From Coronet a couple of
seven-inch 45’s heading for the
hit-parades. Sink the Bismark
(K 5376) is sung by Johnny
Horton, who popularised “The
Battle of New Orleans,” echoes
of which can be detected amid
the gunfire of this opus. Des-
cribed as inspired by the film
of the same name, it has a
pleasant lolloping lilt more
suited to a cowboy-rustler feud
than to a sea epic. Turn the
platter over and once again you
get Johnny and his banjo, this
time telling “The Same Old
Tale the Crow Told Me.” Clas-
sification of both items: rock-
’n’-roll young-folk song.
Less cheerful, but probably
just as much destined for the
top, is John D. Loudermilk's
two-sider “Tobacco Road” and
“Midnight Bus” (KS 372). The
burden of the former seems to
be that it’s a lousy dump, but
there’s no place like it though
nobody knows why. Of the
latter —well, it appears that
John D. mislaid his girl on the
late bus, which would seem to
be a very good reason for buy-
ing a jalopy and avoiding
public transport in future.

The past week was an exciting one,
the focal-point of gaiety being the func-

General, Viscount Dunrossil, and his wife.
In the quietness of the stately private
drawing-room at Government House
presswomen were received by Viscountess
Dunrossil, who delighted them with her
gracious manner, charm and quiet
elegance. The Viscountess is very easy
to talk with, and she showed an endless
interest in all things Australian. The
rich Scots burr in the Governor-General’s
voice is an asset to his speeches. It was
heard at the reception given by the Gov-
ernment of Victoria and in his witty
speech at the luncheon given in his honor
at the Town Hall by the Lord Mayor.
Queen’s Hall, Parliament House, was
seen to great advantage on the night of
Parliament’s reception to the Governor-
General and Viscountess Dunrossil, when,
red-carpeted beflagged, it was also
beautified with tall urns of gold and
white chrysanthemums. The Vice-Regal
pair were received by the Premier and
Mrs. Bolte, and the latter presented the
Viscountess (whose white delustred satins
were embroidered with crystal beads) with
a sheaf of white rosebuds and delicate-
mauve orchids. Mrs. Bolte’s choice was
a sheath-frock of aqua-blue ribbon-lace
encrusted with crystal beads and pearls.
Among the many lovely gowns noticed
Was the brilliant-red velvet chosen by
Lady Jungwirth ; the blue crinoline worn
by Mrs. Arthur Rylah; Mrs. N. G.
Wishart’s deep-mauve satin brocade;
Mrs. Guy Bakewell’s black taffeta which
flared from the knees in a deep frill; and
the black ensembles worn by Mrs. Edgar
Brownbill, Mrs. John Galbally and Mrs.
C. O. Fairbairn.

Focal-point of the decorations in the
Town Hall, when the Governor-General
and Viscountess Dunrossil were guests-of-
honor at a civic luncheon was the replica
of the Dunrossil coat-of-arms. This, com-
pleted shortly before the luncheon, was
set on a deep-blue velvet backdrop be-
hind the official-table. Hundreds of
tawny and pastel-toned chrysanthemums,
autumn-leaves and greenery decorated
the banqueting hall, and on individual
tables were pink roses, carnations and
nerines. Lady Dunrossil chose a shimmer-
ing satin-finished shantung frock in dove-
grey tonings and a tiny hat wreathed with
strawberry-red roses. A sea-green light-
weight woollen frock was worn by the
Lady Mayoress with a velvet toque in
paler green. Mrs. Bolte chose a moss-
green linen tweed suit and a matching hat
swathed with satin. A burnt-orange
velour hat was worn by Lady Lowe with
a beech-brown woollep frock.
Mrs. Lance Reichstein, of Toorak,
wife of a city councillor is on the Board
of Management of the Try Boys Society,
the executive of the Ethel Nilsen Day
Nursery, the Your Opportunity commit-
tee, and the Toorak and South Yarra
branch of the Eye and Ear Hospital
Auxiliary. She is one of the two ticket-
secretciries for the gala-premiere of “Ben-
Hur” at the Metro on May 11, all pro-
ceeds of which will go to the Victorian
Institute for Deaf Children; her tele-
phone-number is 20 3858. The other
ticket-secretary is Mrs. K. Nesbit
(BX 4909). Mrs. Reichstein is keen on
racing, reading and swims a lot in the
summer. She is also noted for the ele-
gance of her ensembles. John Warlow

At Douglas Cox’s collection of spring
and summer fashions, shown at a cock-
tail-party at Ciro’s, it was made quite
clear that florals are out and elegant
Italian prints are in. The newest shades
are the earthenware colors —soft pottery-
beige, stone-grey, golden-sand and burnt-
orange—all most becoming. Most of
these .prints shown were in cotton, with
a sprinkling of pure-silk but still in the
soft, refined print. Cotton-crepe, a new
fabric, was seen in an afternooon-frock
in olive-green, brown and white print,
and featuring a slim draped skirt and
moulded bodice. The most striking
sleeve-treatment noticed was the full,
loose-hanging lantern-sleeve. The button-
through shirtmaker-frock will be even
more popular during the warmer months
and even goes into the more dressy class.
Another interesting fabric was a Swiss
reversible-shantung. A cotton-shantung
in blue-haze tonings made a delightful
afternoon - frock, and cotton - hopsack
printed with pink-tapestry roses on an
olive-green background featured a pin-
tucked neckband and sleeves. Feminine,
soft and appealing was a printed pure-
silk frock for the young girl. Double
unpressed box-pleats fashioned the skirt,
and it had a softly-pleated scoop-neck-
line and short inset-sleeves. The print
was a contemporary floral in a quarry-
shade. Most unusual was a Ketti woven-
cotton day-frock with the clever use of
embroidered stripes forming the box-
pleated skirt, with a panel of green-and-
gold-satin stripes making the shirt-front.
Very flattering to a suntan was a cotton
day-frock made with a full-circle skirt
and buttoned-through for easy launder-
ing. The print was large white squares
on deep-chocolate. There were coy little
pastel-cottons for the teenager, while
others were boldly - patterned with
barbecue - motifs. One of the most
attractive was a pale candy-pink cotton
with a U-shaped bib-bodice edged with
eyelet-embroidery.

Guests from New Zealand, inter-State
and country came to St. Peter’s Church,
Toorak, when Gwenneth Frances,
younger daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Percival Hodge, of Portland, was married.
Her gown of white pure silk shantung
was cut on Princess-lines, and her three-
tier tulle veil fell from a curvette of tulle
leaves. She carried a prayerbook and
a spray of gardenias. The matron-of-
honor, Mrs. M. Edwards, wore a short
mulberry-silk frock with a matching hat
and carried yellow roses. The bride-
groom, the younger son of Mrs. E. M.
Butler, of Randwick, Sydney, and the
late Mr. Butler, had his brother Dr. John
Butler as best man. Reception was at
Myoora, Toorak.

To celebrate Japan’s National Day
(the birthday of Emperor Hirohito) the
Consul for Japan, Mr. N. Nomoto, and
Mrs. Nomoto entertained more than 400
guests at a cocktail-party at Menzies’.
They were assisted by Vice-Consul H.
Iwasaki and Mrs. Iwasaki. Both Mrs.
Nomoto and Mrs. Iwasaki wore colorful
national-dress, as did the many Japanese
women at the party. With the Consul for
France, Mons. Le Bas de Plumetot, was
his wife, who wore a Christian Dior
trapeze-coat of deep-brown faille with a
full-crowned cap of blossom-pink. Mrs.
G. C. Molyneux chose a slim-fitting rose-
pink woollen frock and a grey-and-black
satin toque. With her black ensemble
Mrs. Hamilton Sleigh wore a toque of
tulle in varying shades of blue.

The third exhibition of Flowers For
All Occasions arranged by the University
of Melbourne Flower Group and held
in the Town Hall, was officially opened
by Lady. Herring. Four States—N.S.W.,
S.A., Victoria and Tasmania were
represented by flower arrangements, In-
cluded in the 200-odd exhibits was one
by 15-year-old Louise Johns, daughter
of Mrs. J. Johns, president of the group.
There were international exhibits this
year, with the wives of the Japanese,
German and Chinese Consuls contri-
buting. Among official guests were the


premier’s wife, Mrs. Henry Bolte ; Lord
Mayor Bernard Evans and Mrs. Evans ;
University Chancellor Mr. Justice Dean
and Mrs. Dean; Deputy-Chancellor C.
Gilray and Mrs. Gilray; and the
patroness of the group, Lady Thomas.
SYDNEY
Three first-nights in a row kept theatre-
goers busy this week. First was the
"Phillip Street Revue,” which shortly
goes on tour of the capital cities.
Apart from the wit and liveliness of this
show, there is interest for women also in
,the wonderfully striking dresses designed
for the girls in the cast by Peter Hurst.
Next followed “The Caucasian Chalk
Circle” at the Independent, a show of
completely different calibre. By Bertholt
Brecht, it is a parable from an old
Chinese legend, and argues, judgment-of-
Solomon wise, that the person who takes
the best care of the land is the person who
should own it.
Then on to the Genesians’ happy re-
opening after seven months inaction, with
a remarkably clever production of Sheri-
dan’s “The Critic,” preceded by a drama-
tisation of Dylan Thomas’s “The Return
ilourney” as a curtain-raiser. Actually,
;?ood as it is, the curtain-raiser makes the
(evening a little too long, for “The Critic”
'piles amusement on amusement so richly
that it is a pity to have it spoilt by
worries about whether one is going to get
away in time to catch the last train.

Miss Muriel Downes, the visiting
[English cordon bleu, was guest-of-ho’nor
at the delightful dinner-party arranged
by the committee for the Harlequin Ball
to aid the Mater Hospital. (The ball is
to be held at the Trocadero on June 8.)
Dr. and Mrs. Tom Bateman welcomed
the 200 guests, who strolled through the
gardens (illuminated by the moon and
the fairy-lights) of the Residents’ House
at Wollstonecraft. Included among the
guests were Mr. Justice McClemens with
his daughter Dollis and son Gus, Dr.
H. M. Saxby with daughter Sue, Mr. and
Mrs. George Martin, Dr. and Mrs.
Derek Bracken, Dr. and Mrs. Justin
Fleming. It was a particularly well-
dressed affair, and one specially noticed
Mrs. Fleming’s American-model cocktail-
ensemble of jade-green and gold brocade,
the short jacket matching the simple,
elegant line of the dress..

The opening of the conference of the
Country Women’s Association was as
impressive as ever, with a Town Hall
crammed full of bright and efficient-
looking ladies, a Lord Mayor in full
regalia (Aid. Jensen, who opened the
conference) and a Chancellor of the Uni-
versity (Sir Charles Bickerton Blackburn,
who was the guest-speaker) also in full
rig. It was quite a sight to behold. Mrs.
Jeff Bate, president of the C.W.A., pre-
sented an equally impressive report. She
stressed the voluntary nature of the
Work done by members, and it was cer-
tainly inspiring to hear that during the
38 years of the association’s existence
assets to the value of £969,383 had come
from the hands of women who work on
a completely voluntary basis.

The Women’s Auxiliary in Australia in
aid of Dr. Barnardo’s Homes, which has
been established for only five years now,
has gone on from strength to strength
during that time under the presidency of
Mrs. Rupert Scammell. At the fifth
annual meeting during the week Mrs.
Scammell presented a cheque for nearly
£5OOO to Sir Iven Mackay for the homes.
It was announced that Lady Dunrossil
has given her patronage to the auxiliary
and that Lady Oliver is the new vice-
patron. Miss Betty Archdale spoke on
“Population Problems” at the meeting,
and Mrs. H. C. Showers proposed the
vote of thanks.
An interesting visitor to these shores
is Miss Myfanwy Jones, who will be
travelling round Australia and New
Zealand for the next 18 months or so.
Miss Jones plays the clarsach (small Irish
harp), but she is not Irish ; and although
her name is so Welsh-sounding, she comes
from London. Nor does she sing to this
harp as Mary O’Hara does ; she recites
poetry to its accompaniment. She has a
wide repertory of poems, such as those
by Walter de la Mare, but she also has
special brackets of verses relating to (for
instance) gardens or (much asked-for)
cats.
Miss Jones also plays the big harp, but
when travelling the clarsach is obviously
preferable. If you take your Irish harp
to a party someone is almost certain to
ask you to play.

One conference that could have been
guaranteed to run on the most adequately
oiled wheels was that held at the Ritz,
Leura, last week. Then 40 private secre-
taries, all absolutely the top girls in their
class, met together under the aegis of the
Australian Institute of Management to
study problems peculiar to secretaries to
top-management. Miss June Wingrove,
chairman of the conference, explained
that all the subjects discussed would take
a practical form. The students would be
asked, for instance, to seat in correct
precedence a number of distinguished
guests at a dinner which their boss was
giving, or to compose suitable letters of
congratulation, regret, or complaint,
according to need.
Mrs. R. J. Webster, who before her
marriage was personnel-director of a
large textile firm, gave the opening
address on self-development. Lectures
on memory-training, protocol and plan-
ning, and reporting of meetings were
given by Mr. J. Stephens, Mr. A. M.
Lake, Mr. J. B. Reid and Miss Stella
Swinney.
☆ ☆ ☆
Architect Harry Seidler was guest-of-
honor at the luncheon of the Women
Writers’ Society, and Mervyn Horton
came along to hear him, the only other
man in a feminine assembly. Mr.
Seidler said that the general town-
planning pattern of Sydney was most
alarming, and showed his alarmed audi-
ence how inner districts such as Mc-
Mahon’s Point could be re-developed by
multi-storied blocks of units with vertical
zoning which allows for the tallest build-
ings to be at the back, and every unit
having a view of the water. Miss Beryl
Guertner presided at the luncheon, and
Mrs. Dorothy Catts proposed the vote
of thanks.

The first entrant in the 1960 Red Cross
Silver Bride contest is Mrs. A. J. Ayliffe,
of Goulburn, who is the wife of the
Deputy-Mayor and a keen worker for
Red Cross. She will, like all entrants
in this contest, be celebrating her silver-
anniversary during 1960, and has been
living in Goulburn since her marriage
in 1935. The prize for this contest is
a 10-weeks’ cruise to India and Indo-
nesia for two on Royal Interocean
Dutch Line.
Juliet Rolleston wrote her book, “Pink
Is for Girls,” when she was only 16 and
a schoolgirl at Parramatta High. Novel-
writing for relaxation is not common
among students in the Leaving Certificate
class, but Juliet found it so, and suc-
ceeded in her examination with two first-
class honors, three A’s and one B (in
chemistry). The book, published by
Angus and Robertson’s last week, is light-
hearted, gay and witty. Juliet now lives
with her family at Newport (N.S.W.) and
is studying first-year arts at Sydney Uni-
versity.
The illustrations for the book, by
the way, are by another young woman,
Astra Lacis, who came to Australia with
her parents from Latvia in 1949 and, after
she left school, spent five years studying
at the National Art School in Sydney.
Astra says that she has always wanted to
be a book-illustrator, and even at school
in Latvia (she was born in Riga) she
would illustrate her compositions and
textbooks. Her illustrations to “Pink
Is for Girls” have a lively charm which
suits the mood of the book.


the other South Australian judges were
not validly appointed and who, also
believing that there was no proper
Attorney-General in South Australia,
on one occasion discharged all the
prisoners in the Criminal Court; Way’s
former partner, Gwynne, and Judge
Randolph Isham Stow, both of whom
objected so much to Way’s appointing
himself Chief Justice that they would
not speak to him out of court; Mr.
Justice Cooper, who, though he did
not approve of barristers wearing wigs,
complained, “If indeed anyone is
justified in wearing a wig it is myself;
for in summer I am tormented with the
flies settling on my bare head”; the
conflict with Windeyer’s partisans over
the Privy Council appointment and,
in the course of it, the wonderful scene
that occurred when Sir Langdon
Bonython of the “Advertiser” called
on the Premier, Kingston, whom Way
had called “a vindictive, malicious,
unforgiving scoundrel.” to get his
support for Way (which, in the end, he
gave):—
He was not merely surprised ; he
was dumbfounded. By this time he
had left the chair and was dancing
round the great table, both acting
and talking like a wild Irishman.
“Help the little begger I never
will,” he affirmed. “If you had come
to tell me how I could thwart his
ambitions, spike his guns, or upset
his plans I would have been your
man. Have you forgotten the speech
at Marion when, in spite of being
Chief Justice, he attacked the Gov-
ernment? I am absolutely astounded
that you should come to advocate
any claims that he may be supposed
to possess. I am his enemy ; not his
friend.”
Too often Hannan misses his oppor-
tunities to bring in color of this kind;
too often, in place of it, he quotes long,
tedious orations; he does not wholly
redeem Way from his magnificent
respectability. The book is patchy.
But it should be absorbing reading in
South Australia; valuable to lawyers
anywhere; and, for its patches of color,
its human and historic interest, moder-
ately attractive to any reader who is
prepared to tackle it patiently.
Waterfront Novel
A knockabout life in the backblocks
leading-up to being wounded on
Bougainville, then commercial art and
pulp-novels in the city, led to Ron
Tullipan’s joining the Waterside
Workers’ Federation and so to Follow
the Sun (Australasian Book Society),
a novel about w’narfies loading sugar
in a north-Queensland port.
His hero has been “following the
sun” from ports as southerly as
Hobart, and has' returned to this
Queensland sugar-port where the desir-
able young daughter of a wharfie who
has gone into the shop-fitting business
is waiting to get her hooks into him.
But on the plane into the port he meets
one of the port pubs’ barmaids, a
youngish widow with one child. He
helps her get her child back from her
husband’s family of Italian farmers
and becomes her lover.
Meanwhile his best friend takes
exception to a former mate's becoming
a panno., a pannikin-boss —i.e., a
waterside foreman —trips the foreman
on the ship, is sacked, becomes closer
and closer friends with the widow's
little son, stages a furious fight with
his ex-friend the panno. in which he
is accused of using his loading-hook;
is tried at law and acquitted.
The whole cast is then assembled in
a large, stable, old house to wait-out
a cyclone which wipes-out the panno.-
foreman’s half-built home. The young
widow, chasing her son from the wreck-
age, is struck down by it, and in hos-
pital states her preference for the hero's
best friend. This leaves the hero only
the desirable daughter of the shop-
fitter and the job of secretary to the
union at that port.
Tullipan has learned the lesson of
waterfront solidarity far too well to be
able to stand off and look at his
characters as O'Grady-Culotta did in
“A Weird Mob”; when he writes
tongue-in-cheek it is as you might say,
sotto voce: —
The judge [at the loading-hook
trial] inserted a number of ten-
minute recesses to consult his books
.... But in the public gallery, a
section of the court crowded with
watersiders, it was whispered that
the judge was actually going to the
telephone to Feceive his orders....
But on this occasion the slanderous
whispers were ultimately proven
wrong because the judge in his
summing-up most specifically put
the words “Not Guilty” into the
mouths of the jury. So it would
seem that the majority of whis-
perers in the public gallery were
perhaps more accustomed to the
proceedings of an industrial court.
If Tullipan’s dialogue is not as amus-
ing as Culotta’s, or as precise as that
in Morrison’s short-stories of Mel-
bourne watersiders, his is a more
serious picture of “the worker” than
Culotta’s and more large and complete
than Morrison’s. The reader is shown
the union hall, the union-officers at
work; the watersiders at work and in
the bars; the watersiders marrying,
building themselves fibrolite houses,
getting their sons into offices and pro-
fessions; and especially the hitherto
easy-going wharfie. under the lash of an
ambitious wife, forcing his authority
as foreman and widening the gulf
between himself and his former friends.
The picture of Edgar the panno. is
perhaps the best thing in the book:
he has to bear the strain of relations
between men and employers, the
torture-point of the industry. Tullipan
is fascinated by him; his hero helps the
panno. first, as a friend, to build his
house, and finally sees him, in despair
in the wrecked house, with disgust.
Trying to Get On, one gathers, might
have been forgiven him; riding his
authority was his crime.
All-in-all, it is a fresh and authentic
study and a readable story, represent-
ing the lives of a great many more
Australians who are not watersiders.
"Lower Depths”
The dust-jacket of Weidenfeld and
Nicolson’s new edition of Maxim
Gorki’s Lower Depths indicates a
recent revival of interest in this play,
not only on stage and television in
London, but also in Japan, where it
was filmed in 1957 with local charac-
ters and setting.
The Japanese interest is significant.
Although Japan has for long been
developing Western eyes, its cultural
premises are still very different from
Europe’s; and plays capable of cutting
so far across the differences must be
rare. “Lower Depths” —even in the
present, sometimes limping, transla-
tion-can be seen to have this quality.
In the first place it deals clearly and
directly with questions that are basic
to aIL organised societies—What is
truth? What is freedom? What is the
value of human life? This much
would be enough to ensure a continu-
ing and varied interest in it; but there
is the added appeal of its near-perfect
matching of form and content.
On the surface Gorki’s approach
seems almost crudely simple. By
locating his inquiry in a dosshouse in
a time of depression he is able to pre-
sent a gallery of characters with various
social backgrounds who have been
stripped down to the rawest level of
existence. Here in the lower depths,
where the only outlet downwards is
death, all men are equal, and false
attitudes are useless or worse. Here a
man exists only on what is essential
to him.
Beneath this simplicity, however,
there is a subtle and complex design.
As Moura Budberg, the translator,
notes in her introduction, the play is
in essence a polemic against the philo-
sophies of both Tolstoy and Dostoevski
—as embodied in the characters of
Luka, the saintly wanderer, and
Kleshch, the fatalistic tradesman —and
a triumphant expression of Gorki’s
own estimate of man through the
character of Satin, , the educated
gambler:—
A man can believe or not believe,
it’s his own affair. A man’s free.
He pays for everything himself. For

his belief, his disbelief, for love, for
intelligence. That makes him free.
Man, that’s the Truth. What is man?
It’s not you, nor I, nor they. No,
it’s you, it’s they, the old man,
Napoleon, Mahomet —all in one
.... In this are all the beginnings and
all the ends.... Man. It’s a mag-
nificent word. It has a proud ring.
Man. We have to respect man, not
pity him, not demean him by pity.
But the characters are much more
than symbols: as they cross and
recross, each imparts through speech
and action a rich individual humanity
and an intense personal response to the
central conflicts. The ideas come
memorably to life, and the dosshouse
becomes a world. Modern drama can
show few finer examples of the play
of ideas which is also a play of
character and situation.
The present edition also contains
photos from film- and stage-produc-
tions, and the text of “On the Way to
Lower Depths”—a prologue on some
of the characters which Gorki wrote
in the ’twenties for a Russian film-
version that was not. however, made.
Two Humorists
Everybody who has ever tried to be
funny must have the greatest sympathy
for Alex Atkinson, who has collabor-
ated with Ronald Searle in U.S.A. for
Beginners (Perpetua Books); for, to
make a book of it, Atkinson had to
write at least 40,000 funny words about
the U.S.A., whereas all Searle had to
do was about a dozen cartoons. Faced
with this most harrowing assignment—•
and never, so he says, having been to
the United States —Atkinson tries and
tries (how he tries!) to be funny: —
And in a little place in Minnesota
I didn’t cause the slightest ripple of
excitement when I put down my
nationality as Zulu in the hotel
register. The hotel clerk was the
only one who showed any interest.
He asked me if we were still pestered
with kangaroos in China, and told
the chef to rustle-up some astrakhan
| for my supper.
The amazing thing is that some-
times, chiefly when he is cracking at
the appalling proliferation of tourism
which has for ever befouled the Ameri-
i can outback (and is rapidly destroying
i Australia’s) he is, in a painful way,
amusing:—
l Each year they spend a few weeks
!in their summer place—a prefabri-
cated log cabin in the Adirondacks
with a deep-freeze and a fully
j equipped cinema for showing home
movies. (“When we’re at home we
can see ourselves playing ball in the
Adirondacks, and when we're in the
Adirondacks we can see ourselves
playing ball in Central Park.”) Here
they hunt for bears, catch catfish and
swap yarns round a communal Eezi-
Bild campfire with friends and busi-
ness associates from back home who
also have log cabins.
He is also funny enough on the
equally painful subject of American
food (“Strawberry jam with a double-
decker sandwich of home-cured pork
and crayfish”); but, on the whole,
apparently basing his tour on Ameri-
can guide-books, he just goes on and
on, and the total effect is rather like
an American “1066 and All That,” but
plodding and mechanical.
Flying at ease through all this, either
because the artist doesn’t have so much
work to do or because he happens to be
touched with genius, is Searle at his
grimmest and best and gayest, toler-
ably happy when he can faithfully
illustrate the text with fat businessmen
asleep on the sands but happier still
when he is free to let loose his love of
fantasy and baroque decoration in the
wonderful hillbilly, the Bad Man with
twenty six-shooters, the ten identical
cowboys all doing an identical perish
in the Painted Desert, and the old-timer
from the Yukon riding his horse into
the bar of the soda-fountain.

recipes for use. Beautifully produced
and decorated by Pixie O’Harris, this
book is a useful and practical guide for
anyone who has enough space in their
garden to grow herbs, and for those
who live in flats and are game to experi-
ment indoors. The recipes make your
mouth water.

The Gold - rimmed Spectacles:
Giorgio Bassani (Faber). This intelli-
gent novella, written by a young
Italian and beautifully translated, tells
two stories apparently unrelated yet
complementary. There is the personal
tragedy of a doctor in pre-war Ferrara,
whose medical reputation is beyond
reproach but whose morals make him
a ludicrous outcast. The counterpoint
is the tragedy of the narrator, a young
man from a prosperous Jewish family,
who gets to know the truth about the
doctor at the same time as he recog-
nises how the tide of anti-Semitism
is bound to sweep-away the founda-
tions on which his life has been built.
