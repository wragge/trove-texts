The Poet as a Teacher
Far back in the lost years the poet anc
prophet were one in the people’s thought, an-
one name covered the two ideas. The ancien
Celtic world—through which we get our onl
authentic glimpse of the ancient Europear
world—had a single term to cover bntl
science and poetry; and as the science o
the sixth century taught in Irish school
included the doctrine of the spherical natur
of the earth, it was a pretty large term
Poetry was, in fact, as wide in its applica
tion as philosophy became in the M.ddl
Ages. From Plato to Darwin is a long
step; yet they were both philosophers. Simi
larly, the vines of the Romans could include
such widely-sundered persons as the early
tribal soothsayers and Virgil, the Mantuan
farmer-poet. To-day, in spite of all changes
something of the prophetic idea still clings to
the iroet and someth.ug of the scientific idea
also'. The public demands in a mild way
that the man who sings its songs shall aisi
foretell its future and probe the inner secrets
of life; and it is beyond all dispute that
in a rather indefinite way he really does
these things. Modern instances are con
stantly quoted. Emerson —only occasionally
a poet, but a very striking one when he
found his inspiration—wrote of the worm
that, looking upward, longed to be a man
and so anticipated Darwin by a decade 01
two in his theory of evolution. Tennyson fore-
told with a remarkable accuracy the coming ol
the aeroplane and the airship at a time when
the futility of the original balloon was most
evident. Wordsworth antedated the English
acceptance of the idea of the reincarnation
of souls—an idea which is definitely part of
the creed of John Masefield. Coleridge—in
prose—hinted at the present Irish Free State
before Catholic Emancipation was far on its
way, and when even the repeal of the Union
appeared a hopeless dream of wild enthusi-
asts. Ilenry Lawson, in his “Star of Aus-
tralasia,” gave a detailed description of
much that happened in the Great War. All
these examples are striking enough—indeed,
they are far more striking than the acknow-
ledged prophetic utterances of Isaiah and
Daniel —but it is to be observed that only
in two instances do the utterances referred
to come from the poets in their highest and
most inspired moments. It is rather in his
indefinite but real feeling for the future
that the poet still links up with the ancient
seer. Keats, Shelley and Coleridge all be-
long more directly to our age than to then
own; Shakspeare, in spite of all -who try
to explain him, is far better understood in
Sydney to-day than he was in London in
1598.
It is in this sense that the poe'ts are pro-
phetic, reaching out living hands from the
past and pointing to us and far beyond us.
It is in this sense also that the poets are
teachers ; for no poet worth his ink deliber-
ately sets himself to conduct a school of life.
He is, first of all, the singer, the weaver of
rhythmic thought into forms that express
himself and Ibis views of things that; come
within the scope of his mind. As all emo-
tional thought began rhythmically, and to a
large extent continues rhythmical, the high-
est exponents of rhythmical thought must
be in some sense the world’s best thinkers.
Where the best thought touches and influ-
ences ordinary thought there is education,
improvement, mental refinement —something
that goes to further evolution of the soul
and lifts man a little higher in his develop-
ment from the animal. The high ethereal
song of one generation may easily become
the daily bread of the next; and so the least
didactic of all poetry in end teaches most.
The poet is in reality a paradox, in that he
is of all human workers the one most closely
related to life, and at the same time appears
to be most out of touch with his immediate
surroundings. He is a foreigner to many
in his own age; a good citizen of the age
he does not often live to see. He is no re-
former, but the voice crying in the wilder-
ness" to make straight the path of all reform.
DAVID MCKEE WEIGHT.
The Middle Passage
Of all the trackways of the Seven Oceans
none bears a name more sinister than that
sea-lane between the Guinea coast of
Africa and ■ the West Indies, which men
once called the Middle Passage. For over
200 years the ships that ran this passage
carried West African negroes, sold f.o.b by
their chiefs or captors, and re-sold in the
West Indies to lifelong drudgery. The mer-
chants in the “trade” were mostly Liverpool
firms of high standing. There is a groat
Liverpool shipping firm whose house flag is
flying in Sydney Harbor as I write, which
Was. founded on the traffic—a traffic upon
which I venture to speak with a little autho-
rity, since, less than 100 years ago, my
own family was prominent in it.
The slave-ships ran from the Mersey to
the Guinea coast. There they filled with
their merchandise, and made their landfall
at Barbadoes or Jamaica. Thence, after
temporary cleaning, they went back to Liver-
pool to refit before starting again on their
round. When Mary Gaunt, that very good
Australian who years ago became famous
by her studies of West African conditions
fell ill with war-work, the doctors sent her
to Jamaica, richest and most individual of
the West Indian islands. Not till sh e took
up residence there did sh e realise that this
was one of the final landing-places of those
lost thousands whose people she had known
so closely in her West African journevs.
In Where the Twain Meet (John Murray)'
she has built up for us, with slight digrps-
sic.ns into descriptions of scenery and small
gossip, a story of the slave trade as it was
in the days before the Abolition Act of 1832
There are horrid glimpses, too, 0 f the trade
in its dying days, after the British cruisers
had been unleashed to stop the traffic Con-
ditions were then indeed far more appalling
than in the days when slaves were recognised
merchandise.
In her opening chapter, Mary Gaunt tells
what a lot of us have desired to know
this many a year : how an Australian womai
first came under the clutching influence o
the Guinea coast. As a child she was take
to England (her father was a Victoria
County Court Judge) and stayed with i
Liverpool family which had been conneetec
with the trade. The house was full of \V es
African curios, and the domestic atmospher
was heavy with memories of the dead pas
—how well I know them! There and the
the little girl resolved to some day see th
West Coast for herself. Now, in Jamaica
her West Coast knowledge linked up wit;
that lying ready to hand, and in this boo
we have a story which is worth a tliousant
of the fleeting if vivid glimpses that Marrya
and the author of Tom Cringle’s Lo
have afforded us. There are many book
dealing with the story of the Middle i’assage
written by surgeons, mates and other ship
board officials. There are, too, volumes by
Jamaican officials and clergy and an occa
sional one by such visitors to Jamaica a
Matt Lewis, still remembered as tli
author of that rather hectic story, “Ros
ario, the Female. Monk.” On these books
which Jamaica apparently hoards, Marj
Gaunt fed. The result is a chronicle of las)
and brand, coupled with iniquitous cruelty
concupiscence and murder. Of murder
especially, for five times in 200 years the
Jamaican slaves rose in rebellion, and once
again, in the ’sixties, the free blacks revolted
with results that many living Australians
will remember. Eyre, the Australian ex
plorer, was then Governor, and only his
strong hand prevented a repetition of the
horrors which are known to-day as Ilayt
and Domingo. How he was broken on the
wheel of the Nonconformist conscience is
a commonplace of mid-Victorian history.
There were “humane” slavers. Qne-eyec
Captain Hugh Crow was famous because he
could run the passage with losses of only
one or two per cent. His method was to
wash the slaves daily, give them th e very
best of food “and entertain them with musi-
cal instruments.” When we consider that,
in the days when the trade was legal, the
space allotted a male slave—ironed to the
deck—was 4ft. high, 6ft. long and Ift. 4in.
across, it is not hard to realise that daily
washing was desirable. As to food, on most
ships the slaves had yams and horse-beans
once a day, with a pint of water. This in
the tropics, with, perhaps, two or three
tiers of slave-decks, each with four feet
“head room” ! As exercise, after meals they
were compelled to “jump up and down in
their chains, being otherwise whipt.” Sing-
ing was also encouraged. Of another sort
was the Gloria. She ran short of water, and
the slaves died in such quantities that the
hatches were battened down on dead and
living._ The crew died so fast that the char-
nel ship had to be abandoned by the survi-
vors. There is the story of a captain, told
by one Clarkson, who flogged a 10-months-
old because “it sulked and refused to
eat. ’ He then dipped it in hot water to
heal its hurts, and, observing that the skin
and nails of its toes game off in the pro-
cess, humanely had them wrapped in
cloaths steeped in oil,” and chained the
child to a log on deck. Next day, observing
that it still refused to eat, he flogged the
child again, and then the obstinate little
devil died on him,” as we would say in
Australia. But perhaps the outstanding
story of the tale of horrors is that which
concerns a slaver captured after the Aboli-
tion Act, by H.M.S. Medina, off the Gambia
River. She was fresh from Liverpool, and,
though her cargo was suspiciously scanty’
she had no slaves or slave-fittings on board!
and could not be detained. Soon afterwards
the Medina’s officers Were told that there
had been a young quadroon girl on board
‘wife ’ of the captain. Her discovery would
have meant the loss of the ship, so her
husband tied her to a small kedge-anchor
and dropped her over as the boarding-officer
came up. “Thus,” says the diarist of the
crew, who has preserved the story for us
destroying not only the woman, but his
own unborn flesh and blood.”
, P.! cheerful book to go to bed with*
but it throws a clearer light on the men-
tahty of our forefathers of a century or so
ago than even “The Beggar’s Opera.”
J. B. HIGGINSON.
Bitter-Sweet
Gilbert Mant (R.P. 23/8/’23) makes a
plea for the greater recognition of Walter
De la Mare in Australia. He cannot speak
too highly of the beauty of his poetry, the
gossamer-fine finish of the workmanship. But
he dismisses his prose in two lines, and
makes one statement strange to understand :
h roni his writings one imagines that he
has never come in contact with the ugly
things of life.” Where, then, has De la
M, are i c i irne ? the cynicism sprinkled through
/ en i? irs °^„ a Midget,” the blackness
ot The Return, the mingling of pathos
and grotesquerie in “Miss Duveen,” the
extraordinary bitterness of “The Almond
iree ? And, above all, where has he won
his tenderness and pity? Those are flowers
that sunshine alone can never nourish There
are years of tears and world-knowledge be-
hmd such trifles even as “Tit for Tat” and
Andy Battle. ’ For all its pretty nonsense
plenty of sorrow helps to make up “Peacock

It is always the fantastic, the mystical, the

;, el i he , ls concerned with, the curtain
that divides the Unknown from the Known

amazements of transparence, rather than the
secrets it conceals. This is shown by the
subjects he chooses, as well as by his treat-
ment of them. In his novel, “The Return,”

This reduced reproduction shows
the famous pale green packet of
20 “GREYS"
a commonplace, “decent’ man, weak and
drowsy from the after effects of influenza,
falls asleep in an old graveyard dose to t e
mined tomb of a suicide who is afterw.aids
hinted at as an 18th-century mixture of
Don Quixote and Rousseau. The rebellious
spirit of the long-dead adventurer tries to
escape into the passive frame of the sleepei,
and succeeds to the extent of impressing his
own sinister appearance on his victim, whose
tragedy is that the likeness will “work in.
In “The Vats” two wandering friends, idly
discussing the mystery of Time, come sud-
denly upon some vast immemorial relics, that
“wore that air of lovely timelessness which
decks the thorn, and haunts for the halt-
woken sense the odor of sweet-brier; yet
they were grey with the everlasting, as are
the beards of the patriarchs and the cindery
craters of the moon.” There is no incident
in this “story,” scarcely any definite thought :
but in its profound and tranquil feeling and
in its eerie dream atmosphere it is better
than Poe at his best. “The Looking-Glass”
tells how a lonely consumptive young girl,
watching her last Spring in a garden said
to be haunted, discovers that the ghost is
herself. That is all. But what a clearness
of fatality there is in the presentment of
that baffling garden—“the clearness, as it
were, of glass, of a looking-glass, which con-
ceals all behind and beyond it, returning only
the looker’s wonder.” Like “The Keys of
Morning,” “Mistress Fell” and “The
Truants” —
Ere my heart beats too coldly and faintly
To remember sad things, yet be gay,
I would sing a brief song of the world’s little
children
Magic hath stolen away —
this short sketch voices De la Mare’s passion-
ate appreciation of Young Life, linked always
with his passionate awareness of Death in
Life. Again, in the title story of his latest
publication (“The Riddle and Other
Stories”), he has picked out the same grim
puzzle and dealt with it so gently that it
takes on the tenderness of a fairy-tale. In-
deed, there is more than a touch of Hans
Andersen’s glamor in the spinning of this
heart-breaking little allegory of the not-alto-
gether-terrible nearness of Youth and Death.
“The Memoirs of a Midget” are written
in the first person by surely the strangest
heroine in fiction. Here is no dwarf or
cripple full of resentment against fate, but
a tiny, very human young womak of exquis-
ite beauty, “a pocket Venus,” not, indeed,
self-satisfied, but supremely' satisfied to he
herself, critical and a little disdainful of the
clumsiness of the ordinary people who would
treat her as a toy. It is De la Mare’s longest
and fullest novel, and gives us a gallery of
many portraits besides the sharp-tongued,
dreamy-minded Midget herself and lovely
Fanny Bowater, with her curiously honest
cruelty; and of those other pictures we can
always expect in his prose or verse, vivid im-
pressions of places and occasions. His de-
scriptive work is wholly satisfying. Gilbert
Mant imagines him “deliberating for half a
lifetime over the right word to express a
thought.” The result is that his epithets are
so sure that hosts of phrases once read find
a place for ever in the memory: “The lustre
of lean tapers in dark eyes” ; the listening
birds, “their sidelong beaks in silence lean”;
“Even her hands upon her lap seemed satu-
rate with sleep” ; the cat’s “black head split
like a pomegranate as lie yawned his dis-
gust” ; “Softly as thistledown the days
floated into Eternity.”
As a teller of tales De la Mare is an
artist in the tenuous medium of evasion and
suggestion. His subtlety is sometimes a
little over-refined, so that his works are not
free of exasperations for the reader; but
those are more than compensated for by
originality and many beauties. One note of
sadness is insisted on throughout with wist-
ful irony; the tragic way we humans will
—perhaps must —misread and misinterpret
one another. None can convey more deli-
cately than he the futility of our efforts at
self-expression, or at comprehension of an-
other’s stumbling words. The mask of fea-
tures, the distraction of eyes—those mis-
named windows of the soul —the very inflec-
tions of the voice that would convince us,
help to cloud and distort. “You just hide
in your—in your own inside!” one of his
characters says despairingly, as each of us
must say to our nearest and dearest, again
and again. De la Mare can make us see
fair scenes at will, he can sing and joke
sweetly and with enjoyment, hut, continu-
ally, quoting his own words once more, be
“cries softly and bitterly the solitude and
desperate estrangement of the world.”
ELSIE COLE.
John H. Nicholson and “Halek”
Emily Bulcock (R.P. 16/S/’23) on
“Halek” and its author turns my mind back
to 1896 and my association with John El.
Nicholson, who decorated me, unworthy as I
was, with his Order of the White Stone. I
think I was its first and probably its last
member, for, though fond of symbolism,
Nicholson was too restless and unworldly to
persist in any attempt of propaganda. I
can see him before me—impulsive, impatient,
irritable, in his mental moods like a cat on
hot bricks. If ever man wrestled with the
Devil he did it in his fretful efforts to con-
quer the flesh, which to him was synoymous
with bad temper and Heaven knows what else
besides. He was the imperfect Halek and
sought to be the perfect Halek —and the
seeking was the tragedy of his life, as I see
it. It’s a terrible thing to choose an Ideal
you cannot have or be. Perhaps Nicholson
found peace in his latter days, but Emily
Bulcock’s references do not suggest it.
He was a really remarkable man in
that he had the soul longings of a St. Fran-
cis of Assisi and the bodily frailties of a
Faust: I have never met a man in whom the
spiritual struggle itself was as devastating
and unconquerable. Alas, that so much he
grieved about mattered so little! In the
days I speak of he was trying to teach me
grammar; but grammar “bored him stiff”
when he was with one, like himself, more in
tune with tire infinite and in search of the
Absolute than interested in syntax and the
rest of it. So our grammar lessons were
fearful and wonderful visionings and excur-
sions. Yet the man’s intense love tor
purity of diction and simplicity of style was
so great as to be tempestuous if its sensi-
tiveness were wounded. He literally
writhed when words jarred his melodious ear.
I next met Nicholson while I was over-
seer in the Brisbane printery which tui ned
out the second edition of "Halek.” I saw
that all his heart if not his life was in his
book. It was an obsession —a spectacle ot
devotion never to be forgotten by the nn-
pressionable young fellow I then was. lhe
author preceded the story itself with letters
relating to “Halek.” When the work was
finished the “Red Page” notice of it made
him smart dreadfully, because it said slight-
ingly something about these letters being
puffs as if of a patent pill.
On re-reading the letters it is interesting
to find high commendation from W. E. Glad-
stone, and the opinion of the Rev. G. D.
Buchanan (who counted considerably in his
day) that “when all the little books, writ-
ten for little minds, shall be forgotten
‘Halek’ will stand as the dream of a seer
whose vision of life came to him in the wilds
of the Australian bush Multitudes yet
unborn will be thankful that John H. Nichol-
son lived, dreamed and wrote.” Mr.
Reginald Id. Roe, then master of the Gram-
mar School, refers to “Halek” as “a literary
work, a ‘well of English undefiled’ ” and
Roe knew the good from the bad. The
author, by the way, let me take the copy of
the English edition supplied to us as “copy”
for the second edition. He had made a fair
number of emendations with a painstaking
care that evidences the thought he gave to
polishing his sentences. The corrections are
an attractive study. Minor ones show that
"Art which raises him” is altered to “Art
which can elevate him.” “For I truly love
you” gets the adverb excised. “It seldom
happens” is made “it is seldom,” and “was
just introducing him” becomes “was on the
point of introducing him.” “Wonderful
mountains” is changed to “far-off moun-
tains.” “The wonderful windings of a song”
is lengthened to “the wonderful windings of
one clear voice that pealed forth from the
hymn of praise as though it would pierce its
way to the very stars.”
“Halek” is full of prose poetry. May one
quote
THE SONG OF HALEK.
I call to the maid whom I named long- ag-o Turoni.
She sat in the- Temple, her white-haired father beside
her. I gazed on her face, and my soul filled with
love.
I am singing to thee —Turoni.
Unknown to me was her dwelling; what was her
name I knew not; only her beauty I knew, arid the
gentle grace of her movements. Only one look did
she grant ine before she departed.
I am seeking for thee —Turoni.
Many around me love and are loved in return;
many a song is sung in the light of a beautiful eye.
But I sing alone, and the tone dies out in the dark-
ness.
I am waiting for thee —Turoni.
Only in dreams do I see thee; my love has lived
only on hope.- Show me a token to tell me I hope
,riot in vain. My heart is weary with looking and
longing for thee.
I love thee alone —Turoni.
There is a noble dignity in the note on
which the romance closes: —
This then is the book which I wrote at the com-
mand of Alphariz the Prince of Sahitam; and I pray
him that reads it to believe that I have always en-
deavored to write honestly and truly concerning
such things as 1 have thought worthy to he related.
It is, I think, likely that “Halek” will
live —though one never knows. Francis
Adams paid homage to its literary craft.
Otherwise its defects seem to me damaging.
Beautiful in manner it is commonplace in
matter. At times the jiathos is very near
bathos, as when enjoining exercise or moral-
ising on food and drink. The depicted pil-
grimage is a pious one, without the virile
strength and allegorical glory of Bunyan’s
book. “Halek” is somewhat Sunday-school-
ish, and is redolent of the philosophy of the
one-time British Workman. Not greatly
mystic, it hardly misses being obvious like
a tract. “It could have been written only
by a man of spiritual genius and of deep
Christian experience,” said the Rev. Hugh
Jones, M.A. But I make bold to say that
these very qualities prove limitations to the
realisation of the great conception our Saint
John had of a didactic work profound in its
truth as much as magnetic in its beauty.
The theology of “Halek” is far too prim and
particular even for its times. Largely auto-
biographical, it is interpretative of a man’s
worries with the mechanism of church-bound
conventions. It is chiefly concerned with
the effeminacy characteristic of little sins.
Had Nicholson’s thought been wider his book
had been greater.
R. S. ROSS.
A Satchel of Books
The Booh of a Benedict, by Duncan Swann (John
Lane). A sort of a diary of a London man-about-
town for a year. Written with much quiet humor.
Nothing- to get excited about; but pleasant company
for an hour or two.
Laughing Water, by Emil Droonberg (John Lane).
A crude tale of the Canadian nor’-west, of value
only for some apparently faithful pictures of the
life lived by the remnants of the Indian tribes
in their reservations.
Buggies of Red Gap, by Harry Leon Wilson (John
Lane). A cheap (3s. 6d.) English edition of this
American writer’s entertaining story of the adven-
tures of the Hon. George Vane-Basingwell’s valet
first in Paris and then at Red Gap in the Western
States. It is the work of an artist, and there is a
chuckle on every page.
Saturday Nights, by F. W. Thomas (Putnam’s).
Brief stories and sketches originally contributed to
London Star, most of which are worth reading for
the author’s flashes of humor and frequent felicity
of expression. He does best in his pictures of village
types, and sometimes turns a flashlight on to a
group’ of Sussex yokels with all the skill of Sheila
Kaye-Smith.
Gypsy Royal, Adventuress, by Mary Marlowe (Col-
lins, London). This Australian writer’s best up
to the present. The story, which has a strong
theatrical flavor, is easily told, and the characterisa-
tion shows a close study of types. Gypsy Royal
herself is an engaging young person, but the hero,
John Oliver, only measures up to f.a.q., and perhaps
that's all the authoress meant him to. * A book to
be put on your list of Christmas presents.
JJistoire de la Literature FranQaise C&ntemporain ?,
by Reiri Lalou (from F. W. Preece, Adelaide), begins
v.ifh the “masters of Parnassus” —de Heredia, Sully
Prudhoinme and their friends —and has something to
say about every prominent figure who has appeared
in' the writing world during the intervening half-
century. Even journalists like Clemenceau and
Gustave Tery get a mention. Possibly on the prin-
ciple that the reader is expected to know all about
the genuine Olympians already, Flaubert occupies
three pages of this book, and Andre Gide —who is
deader to-day as a novelist than his idol Wilde—l 7
pages. However, in a volume of nearly 700 pages
containing hundreds of criticisms, many of a most
challenging description, it is inevitable that all tastes
should not be suited. What Lalou’s work does
is to provide a highly-colored panorama which must
interest all students of French literature, and which,
with its admirable index and biographical list, will
be found priceless for reference purposes.
Babe', by John Cournos (Wm. Heinemann). This
is Cournos’s third printed attempt at depicting the
naive impressions of one Gombarou, a migratory
Russian-Yankee journalist. He was released in “The
Mask,’’ his life in the thirsty continent was covered
in “The Wall,” and now “Babel” deals with his
brain-fevers in Paris and London. A futile love
affair with an uncertain damsel threads exasperat-
ingly through alternate patches of fine writing and
fogged impressions.
Punch and Holy Water, by John Freeman (Hurst
and Blackett). Captain Ernest Wylie, ex-soldier
and gentleman of fortune, is buzzing around Poland
in a motor-car, and encounters' a beautiful Polish
madame with a bad Bolshevik husband who perishes
perfunctorily on the last page to allow the lady
to leap at the English hero with a cry of joy. But
before the wedding bells ring in the sweet English
village where Ernest was born, the reader has a good
fill of peril and adventure. Freeman has a masterly
indifference to probability which will enable him to
outpace Oppenheim and similar chroniclers in the
long run.
Lanterns of Horn, by Mrs. Evan Nepean (John
Lane). Another of this author’s Stuart stories —
in a foreword W. J. Locke describes her as a de-
scendant of the Stuarts; apparently of that Char-
lotte Stuart who comes into the last pages of this
book: “Wise Charlotte Stuart, who walked open-
eyed through the stews [of Whitehall], holding
ever to the straight path, dreaming no dreams, but
spinning out of the tangle of that evil place a
web of the finest texture, her own great love for
Charles 11, the passion she kept clean. ’ Mrs. Nepean
has toiled tremendously at the sordid history of
Charles’s Court, and, though the glamor of the
handsome blackguard has captured her, she still
presents a faithful picture of “the stews” and of
manv of the characters (mostly disreputable) who
helped to make them. But if you expect thrills,
as you reasonably plight, you will be disappointed.
The Life of Shackleton, by Hugh Robert Mill
(Heinemann). In writing this book, illustrated with
many photographs, Dr. Mill, an old friend of the
explorer, has had the assistance of Lady Shackleton
and access to her private papers. It is a very com-
prehensive performance, though naturally more of
a eulogy than an analysis. Still it is possible, read-
ing between the lines, to arrive at a conclusion
which is not new —that, though Shackleton was a
leader who commanded the confidence and in many
cases the affection of his officers, he did not always
get along very well with his lesser subordinates;
and when he was making the preparations for his
last voyage he wrote in great joy to a friend that
he was taking “17 officers, no A.B.’s, all men
keen on work.” His own enthusiasms were tre-
mendous ; he was utterly fearless; and he worked
prodigiously. On the other hand he loved the lime-
light and popular applause ; he made promises rashly;
and his business, incapacity amounted almost to
genius. After his successful Nimrod expedition he
made a triumphal progress through Maoriland
and Australia, and, though funds were short, he
gave away practically ali the money his lectures
produced. Later, in S. America, when his finances
were even more strained, he scattered his money
with just as little thought of the future. He was,
in short, what so many other outstanding Irishmen
have been: hasty and impetuous; intolerant of re-
straint ; generous to a fault; fond of the spectacular ;
optimistic to-day and brooding to-morrow, yet throw-
ing himself wholeheartedly into whatever labor it
produced; courageous without having the least con-
sciousness of it; given to homesickness, yet an in-
veterate wanderer; and in his home-life a model
of all the virtues, if we can delete from the cata-
logue of essentials the capacity for settling dow n
to relieve his family of financial worry and anxiety.
A last word from Hugh McCrae:
Mr. McKee Wright and myself agree upon one
point, that a private conversation should not ue
made a subject for public discussion. It was be-
cause I thought Mr. Wright had taken my unprinted
word, and used it as a means to trounce me in the
Red Page, that 1 wrote a reply to Interesting-
Poetry.” Mr. Wright, however, has now cleared
my mind of this false impression, and I oner him
my regrets. Yet I still remain at odds with mm
in regard to certain comments upon my declaration
that there exists hardly a verse of mine which »us
not been suggested by something Norman Lindsay
has done before me. Mr. Wright argues that this
remark is “finely generous, but, on internal evidence,
it is not true.” I do not mean that every picture
Norman Lindsay draws will find its counterpart in
some single verse that I have written. My lines
do not contain separate metrical translations oi
“The Garden of Happiness,” “Scherzo,” “Unknown
Seas” or “The Comedy Ends,” but, generally, 1
have drawn largely upon the spirit which has given
these pictures to the world. I have yet to learn
that it is a mistaken courtesy to acknowledge the
medium through which we discover our highest emo-
tion. Some find it in the sun, the flowers, tne
grass, in warm hands and quickened hearts, as does
Mr. Wright himself; others in crowded rooms, with
painted flesh, with fans twirling cigarette smoke
over tables of luxury, and with a deluge of money;
others, again, meditate upon death and images of
despondence. I myself am inclined to mingle
among the nature-worshippers, and I seem to win
more, and to win more easily, in the companionship
of a friend so perfectly in accord with my own feel-
ings. The comparison Mr. Wright makes between
the writer and the artist, in this instance, is
injudicious, because it would appear to put two
people into rivalry for place, whereas the only
rivalry between them is one founded upon a basis
of mutual affection. Finally, with regard to
D.M.W.’s adaptation of a new title, “Secret Poetry,”
a sentence from Seneca, very little altered, shall
give him his answer: “A mail may write without
ostentation, without envy.”
“Wilfrido”: The Hawtliornden Prize has gone this
vear to David Garnett for liis “lady into Fox.” I
can’t think of it as the most promising imaginative
literary work of the year. The story is unusual,
but not brilliant. A lady is turned into a fox
and, growing more and more foxy and (naturally)
less ladylike, finishes up by being done to death
in her worried husband’s arms by a pack of hounds.
The prize is worth £lOO and is accompanied by a
silver medal, the design of which is taken from
the best medal struck during the year. Miss Alice
Warrender is the donor. The competition opened :n
1919 when Edward Shanks was adjudged the winner
with his “Queen of China,” a volume of poems.
It looked as if the bards had a lien on the Hawthorn-
den when 1920 saw John Freeman successful with
his “Poems, Old a nd New” ; but Homer Wilson, the
novelist, scored with her “Death of Society” a year
later. Poesy won again in 1922 with Edward
Blunden’s “Shepherd.”
“Bad Australian”; Contributors have dealt with
the distribution of The Bulletin from the horizon-
tal point of view; it seems to me that the paper
scores as well when viewed from the vertical. It
is common knowledge that the Diggers left the
red cover in the Jordan Valley, at a considerable
distance below sea level. I can vouch for its pre-
sence in a camp on the slopes of the Volcan San
Pedro, in the desert of Alacama, S. America, 13,000
feet above sea level. I have studied the Wild
Cat column near Potosi (14,000 ft.), considered the
truths and otherwise of Abo. yarns in La Paz
(12,000 ft.), admired the poetic genius of “Bellerive”
on the Uspallata Pass (13,000 ft.) and away back
about ’l5 I saw a copy near the head of the Hor-
cones Valley, Mt. Aconcagua (17,000 ft.). That is
about as high as any warm-blooded publication ought
to venture.

ONLY when you realise what tremendous results
can be achieved with the CASE Tractor will you
get an idea of its utility and economy. Take a
practical instance—one of hundreds which could be
quoted.
A New South Wales Farmer writes ;
"In 23 days the 15/27 Case Tra&or ploughed 380 acres
at a cost of 1/8] per acre for fuel used including benzine,
oil and kerosene. It displaced three eight-horse teams
representing a saving in fuel versus chaff of £5B and
about £2O in wages. The Tractor gave no trouble it
was a pleasure to handle.”
Is it any wonder that progressive farmers throughout Australia are preferring the
mechanical power of the CASE to the older method of horse power ? The results
obtained by the CASE mean better farming, a saving of time, labour and worry, reduced
expenses, increased profits. Convince yourself that the CASE Tractor is the power you
need for your farm. There is a size to fit your need. Write for Catalogue .

Cold Storage in your Home without Ice
~ f
m
Condensed Specifications.
Briefly, the plant consists of an insulated cabinet, a
power-driven compressor, expansion coils, brine
tank, ammonia condenser and cooling-water tank
with circulating pump. The cabinet measures over
all sft. ti-n. wide x sft. high x 2ft. 4in. deep. There
is no room for details here, but we quote the con-
clusion of the
OFFICIAL REPORT FURNISHED BY
Messrs. Ferrier and Dickinson, Ltd.,
Consulting Engineers, Sydney.
“To sum up, it is a substantial machine with
very fete working parts and of simple design. It
has an efficient scale or dirt-trap and strainers,
also a, good delivery vessel. These vessels are
wrought, not cast. There is no so-called automatic
gear to get out of order, and given the ordinary
amount of care due to any machine it will do good
service.
“The machine need not be run continuously, as
the brine tank takes up the heat developed in the
cabinet while the compressor is stopped. The
compressor is patented and is constructed on well-
known mechanical principles, the adaptation of
which constitutes the patent .”
PEOPLE who live outside the ice-delivery radius have long
waited in vain for a satisfactory cold-storage plant. For
althougn the ammonia-compression system is recognised as
the best system known for producing refrigeration, its application
to small units for household use has not previously been
accomplished with complete success. There have been, of course,
many attempts to market a plant utilising a substitute for anhydrous
ammonia, such as carbonic acid, sulphurous acid, "frozen air,”
etc., but the road is strewn with these failures. Now, however,
The “0.G.” REFRIGERATOR
(Ice-less)
which is an Australian patent and of Australian manufacture,
introduces a simple, safe, efficient and trouble-proof plant which
will give continuous refrigeration at very low cost. It can be used
both by the city-dweller and by the man “out back o’ Bourke.”
Once installed there is no operating expense, except the power to
run the compressor (about Ih.p.) an hour or two per day.
To the women in country homes who are continually fighting
an uphill battle to keep meat, milk and other foodstuffs fresh
during the long, hot summer months
To their menfolk, who know so well the relief contained
in a long, cool drink after the day’s toil in blazing sun and parching
dust
To hotel-keepers, club-stewards, soft-drink dispensers, butchers
and others whose service is most appreciated when coolest
rendered
Even to those within reach of a regular ice supply, who
recognise the advantages of dry cold and low running expense,
which this plant offers as compared with the wasteful and insanitary
melting-ice system
To everyone, in fact, the “D.G.” Refrigerator will prove an
absolute boon. We have a leaflet just off the Press describing the
plant in detail. Ask for one promptly, so that you may install for
this summer.

A canopy more gentle than the sky,
And steal with carpet of the blooms they
shed
The noise of any footsteps that pass by j
A street where time is measured by the tail
Of tiny bells that never seem to die,
But, silent tolling, charm the ear of all
With color music evtm when they lie
In powd’ry legions on the fragrant earth ,
A street where innocence and majesty
Unite to give a wondrous beauty birth—
A beauty fraught with sunlight on a sea,
The peaceful shadows of a mountain stream,
The eloquence and quiet of a dream.

Around the horns, as cynic Fate had planned.
We are no more to Fate than a voice heard
Calling the aeons by creation’s wheel;
No more, no more to Time than a midge slain
Within a sunbeam by a migrant bird,
Or than a star, crunched under God’s great
heel,
Glimmering to darkness in the vast Inane.

DARIUS.
The Choice.
So stony-rough, so steep and stern it lay,
The path that I must climb till close ot
day .
The cloudy dust uprose, the air grew chill,
And I was in the shadow of the hill !
But as I toiled along all wearily,
Above the path a young rose smiled at me;
Alluring, fair, it seemed, this queen of
flowers,
The guardian 1 of some gate of dulcet hours.
And then I looked and saw beyond, the gate
A thousand roses in their royal state,
About a garden where was ample room
For all the flowers of all the world to bloom.
Above the blossoms, fragrance, spiced and
rare,
Like purest incense rose upon the air.
The soft, seductive atmosphere was blent
With many a delicate, delicious scent
That held me in enchantment of delight,
Till right itself seemed wrong and wrong
seemed right.
Intoxicated, thralled in every sense
Until I scarce knew why I came, nor whence,
Soft on my ear there fell a magic sound
Which seemed to echo all the garden round.
It was. I think, the roses’ hearts that sang!
The passionate, voluptuous chorus rang
Adown the garden, and the list’ning trees
Murmured a bass of solemn harmonies.
Shrill grew the music. Creatures lithe and
wan
Chanted and danced the emerald sward
upon ;
And the red roses in their singing swayed,
Caressing, luring; but I grew afraid.
Great wrong it were by folly or mischance
To mingle in that old, unholy dance.
The price of dalliance who but I should pay,
Who wandered from the hard, the chosen
way ?
Stern was the Path and stern the Law for
me —
Dare the vowed pilgrim stay for revelry?
I turned away but never could forget....
Ah, no ! I hear the roses singing yet!
N.S.W.
MARJORIE QUINN.
Nectarine.
A vessel for sweet syrups hid therein,
Packed tightly in the dappled crimson skin,
And swaying in the slow, hot noontide
breeze,
Like comfits hung on old-world Christmas-
trees,
In orchards where grey Time forgets to spin.
He lets the wheel lie idle ’neath his hand,
Leashing the moments in a flower-wide band.
The bobbins are unwound, the thread
hangs slack,
No peering forward and no looking back —
Time draws a poppied breath in Lotus land.
Far off a lazy farmyard bird complains
With drowsy cackle ; and from sleepy lanes
A rumbling cart-wheel deadens on a rose
Some hedge left trailing. Here the nec-
tarine glows
Forgotten sunlights and white autumn rains
That toiled to shape it out of earth and dew
To spreading flower. A scented sac it grew,
An envelope for luscious essence, swung
The bright green patines of the boughs
among.
Incense for Spring on every wind that blew.
Now Nature rests. The fruit is ripe, the
grain
Full-eared. Soon shall long shadows reign
Over the bending lances of the grass,
The reds and greens into grey sameness
pass;
But on NGht’s lip these fragrances remain.
QUEENSLAND.

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1923.
THE DAY OF THE DICTATOR.
It is instructive to observe the change of
front that Conservative opinion here has
executed in respect of the egregious Musso-
lini. When he first announced that Liberal-
ism had been overdone, and he was there to
bury Freedom, Toryism was edified. The
Conservative is naturally suspicious of free-
dom, and more particularly of free speech
and a free press—two fatal institutions from
the standpoint of privileged individuals who
want to make money or otherwise acquire
power by methods which do not admit of
criticism. Half the Empire’s war fortunes
were grounded on measures like our War
Precautions Act. Mussolini’s stock only
slumped here when he disclosed himself as
anti-British, a thing he Avas bound to become,
being an adventurer and a non-Britisher, the
moment it suited his book. Ethics do not
influence vigorous -opportunists of the Musso-
lini type, who, in pursuit of their ambition,
would destroy England or any other country
as readily as they Avould freedom. Musso-
lini’s Spanish imitator, Rivera, happened
to appear when the Italian anarchist had dis-
credited himself in the eyes of Australian
Imperialists, and so he is suffering in the
esteem of the daily press by repercussion.
Yet he is what his model began by being—
a reformer, an upholder of piety and virtue,
and one who is prepared to assert his convic-
tions by martial law, which, as British
Judges have often remarked, is no law. There
is nothing novel about the methods of either
potentate. In censoring political opinions
and the press they are merely going back
to the period when Montesquieu and Rous-
seau had to publish most of their works in
foreign countries, and in censoring morals
and religious beliefs to the age when those
who did not conform to the views of those
in powder were hanged or burned. Our war
censorship—senseless as regards keeping
either the enemy or the public in the dark—
had similar origins; and the compulsorily-
signed newspaper article, which is Labor’s
contribution to freedom of public discussion,
dates back to the middle of last century.
All such devices have been tried countless
times by distracted nations, and presently re-
jected as fatal to peace and prosperity.
Tyranny can no more cure a nation’s sor-
rows than cocaine can heal a wounded heart.
* * * *
The application of these remarks to Aus-
tralia lies in the fact that pocket Musso-
linis and under-sized Riveras are push.ng
to the front in all directions, while in the
resulting confusion there is a real danger
of the greatest asset bequeathed to us by
Britain—-namely, that legalism which is the
basis of freedom—being made into the thing
of scorn it has become in the chief Latin
countries and in Russia. As showing how
far we have gone in the direction -of Lenin-
ism, the S. M. Herald, which before the
World War had Liberal proclivities, recently
published the following :
Is absolute freedom of speech such a good thing
as is so often claimed for it? The fact is, although
too many of us are apt to forget it, that free
speech is both undesirable and impossible with
civilisation constituted as it is at present. Speech
must be guarded, guided and confined.
The text was the determination of the Rev.
ff C. Foreman, of Sydney Methodist Mis-
sion, to engage in street preaching in cer-
tain nominated areas, and had special refer-
ence to his claim that “a term in gaol was
preferable to surrendering a cherished right.”
It is easy to be humorous , at the expense of
idealists. Sydney Sun was extremely wag-
gish concerning this clergyman’s somewhat
hackneyed reference to “our priceless inheri-
tance of liberty of speech.” But, however
voiced, the principle remains, and it is in
no sense a subject for derision. In point of
fact the Rev. H. C. Foreman would not
have been derided by this section of the press
nut that his case happens bo be also that of
J- S. Garden and his fellow-Oommunists.
Garden put his view of the matter with
characteristic truculence:—
The Communist party intended to organise 500
oi the working-class, who would be prepared to
get upon the platform in the streets and ausert their
beliet in freedom of speech, and the 500 would be
prepared to go to gaol in support of their rights.
Plainly a dangerous, or at best objectionable,
character, and one who merits the gag,
since tarring and feathering has not yet been
acclimatised in this country. The suppres-
sion of the gentle Foreman— who, it is to
be observed, proposed to speak only in nomi-
nated areas, so that there could be no ques-
tion of interference with traffic—is merely
incidental to the disciplining of the noisy
Garden; but the wild justice of absolutism
is not concerned with fine distinctions. Once
proclaims that freedom of speech
shall die, it must be castor-oil all round for
those who dispute his whim. It happens
sometimes that deeds of absolutism are popu-
lar—though that does not make them any
less rotten and dangerous. Mussolini and
the late Stambuliski delighted the anti-
socialists of Europe by some of their illegal
acts, and Rivera is no doubt being applauded
by the Catholic Church for his barrack-
square way with Spain’s rationalists. The
deportation of the Irish envoys pleased 95
per cent, of Australians, in the sense that
the blusterous and bad-mannered pair had
become so unpopular by the Gnie action was
taken that few minded what despiteful thing
was done to them. Yet the deportation of
those who preach republicanism, or even
anarchy, is alien, to the spirit of our Con-
stitution, and trial by Board is abhorrent to
it. The latter is simply a form of the
il rench Tribunal des Conflits —a body which
is guided not by legal principles but by the
opinion of the members as to what is expe-
dient for the State —and as such it is as
much out of place in a British community as
the I rench assumption that every accused
person is guilty. The post-war tendency to
do wrong that good may come of it, to be
unconstitutional in the name of constitution-
alism, and to commit illegal acts in the cause of
legality, has encouraged “Captain-Chaplain”
Wilson, M.L.A., to try the Ku-Klux-Klan
° a , e a l r T ead - v hate-sundered State of N. S.
Wales. Needless to say his stated intentions
are of the best. Religion, purity, sobriety,
Christian charity and all the civic virtues
are to be inculcated by the Klan—if neces-
sary, as in the U.S.A., with the utmost vio-
lence. What, of course, will happen, if
the calamity ever arrives, is that certain sec-
tions only will be dealt with. Mussolini
does not thrash or dose anti-socialists, though
plenty of them undoubtedly deserve it;
Rivera will not be found hanging his friends’
unless they begin voicing tenets which hap-
pen to be of assistance to the other side;
and Ku-Klux-Ivlansmen are not heard of
chastising one another, though it would be
absurd to assume that all the righteousness
or the U.b. is monopolised by themselves.
* # * *
The alternative to this state of affairs is
the system which was good enough for us
before the war came and upset our sense of
political and ethical values. It may be un-
desirable that a Garden should be* allowed
to advocate anarchy, but it would be 10,000
times more so if it were ever established
that speech on public questions was to be
“guarded, guided and confined” by Gov-
ernments. We owe every important right
we enjoy as citizens to the assertion, genera-
tion after generation, of the opposite theory;
and we will begin to lose those rights as soon
as the bureaucrats are able to blanket free
speech in the press or on platforms. It is
not necessary to look back further than the
war years for proof. A censorship which
was initiated nominally to curb pro-German-
ism and its effects soon came to be a weapon
for use against anyone who disapproved of
the colossal follies of Hughesism. Similarlv,
while it is regrettable that persons should
get drunk, violate the liquor laws, commit
adultery or otherwise infringe the decalogue,
it would be immeasurably worse if, as in
America, private-enterprise moralists were
to set up inquisitions to discourage lapses of
the sort. The reformers may call themselves
what fancy names they please, but they are
anarchists just the same—not theorists like
the futile Garden, but practical ones—and
they must breed faction fighting as dirt
breeds flies. Under legalism, which pre-
vailed throughout the civilised world before
most of the nations went mad, every human
activity, from public speaking to private
crime, was provided for by certain fixed
rules. They were not perfect rules, inas-
much as they did not give ideal results in
every case. But they served on the whole —
as was likely, seeing that they represented
the massed wisdom and experience of some
30 centuries. To compare the jerry-built
codes of Fascism, Klanism, etc., with the
constitutionalism which their originators aim
to subvert is like comparing vice with virtue,
order with riot. This is so if only because
the ruffians or buffoons behind such move-
ments are not inspired by the passion for
abstract justice which gave birth to British
legalism, but by class or religious hatred,
and above all by a determination to gain
money and power for themselves.
TWO REDS—OR ONE?
Ex-Treasurer Lang, of N. S. Wales, did
something the other day towards clearing
up a vexed question—that concerning the dif-
ference between the Red Objective adopted
at more than one Labor Conference, and
accepted, to save their political necks, by
Theodore, Dooley and the party leaders
in general, and the Communists’ Gory Objec-
tive. The two are so much alike that it is
a common impression that there are not two
but only one. It transpires, however, that
there is quite a difference between them; and
estate-agent Lang explains how: —
The press is all astray in imagining that the
present objective of the A.L.P. is the same as the
objective of the Communists. The latter accepts
the method of revolution, while the A.L.P. objective
adheres to constitutional means. The difference
is vital.
So far from indicating any difference, this
seems to be a disingenuous admission that
there is no difference in the terminus aimed
at, the only variation being in the means of
locomotion. Whereas one end of the crowd
reckons that it will have to get there with
bloodshed, the other, being possibly scared
lest the blood should be its own, hopes to
arrive without.
# * * #
The Red Objective, whether meant to be
arrived at constitutionally or any other old
v/ay, is the one which the Russian revolu-
tionaries adopted, to the country’s great and
picturesque disaster, and which Russia is
steadily getting rid of. Practically the whole
Communist system has already been scrapped.
P'eople buy and sell in the old way, the pro-
cess of trading only through a public depart-
ment, as in the days when the State owned
the whole apparatus of distribution, being
hopeless, for the process proved impossibly
slow, and the egg went bad in transit. A
vast number (perhaps the majority) of the
nationalised industries have been leased or
sold, because direct State ownership of the
means of production produced pathetically
little. The recognition of private property
is being resumed. The magnificent issue of
paper money secured on “all the public and
private assets of the community,” as the
good old phrase goes, is to be burnt or other-
wise dismantled, and replaced by the old
sort of currency that capitalists believe in.
But, however tired Russia may be of the
Red Objective, the article is still supplied
for foreign consumption. A message came
some time ago from the Third International
at Moscow, advising the Communists of Aus-
tralia to wrap the cloak of hypocrisy round
their spectre of bloodshed, and v get into
Lang’s more polite Labor movement, and
take possession of it from within. A sus-
picion that many of them are in may explain
the earnestness with which elderly stagers
who seek to avoid the tumultuous battle-
field seek to prove that such folk can’t get
in. But it really seems to matter little
whether they get in or not. If by any wild
turn of fortune the revolutionary Objeetion-
ables seemed like attaining success, the con-
stitutional Objectionables would presumably
join in rather than be left out of the Soviet
and the profits. And if the overthrow of
civilisation was being achieved by “consti-
tutional” devices, it isn’t likely that the
“dinkum” Communists would insist on a
wholly superfluous appeal to arms.
It may really be argued, seeing that the
Objective is Red in either case, that the
revolutionary and bloodsheddy party is the
less unpleasant of the two. If Labor secured
a majority in both Federal Houses, and
established the first Red Government, there
would be far too many “constitutional”
possibilities ahead —always provided the
Government had strong leadership, plenty of
courage and faith. There are all the usual
opportunities in the way of altering the
franchise, and the stalwarts of the party
would joyously alter it on the Russian plan,
which has proved a very serviceable one—
at any rate, the same old crowd appears to
be in office for life. There is nothing in
our Constitution against gerrymandered!
electorates for the Lower House, stuffed
electoral rolls, ghost voters or ballot-boxes
with sliding panels. The men who put the
momentous document together wholly forgot
to provide that the ballot-box shouldn’t slide
or perform other conjuring tricks. It is
not so certain as it might be that the North-
ern Territory couldn’t be subdivided by
virtue of Clause 121, and admitted as a
group of States, under “such terms and con-
ditions, including the extent of representa-
tion in either House of The Parliament as
it [Parliament] thinks fit,” the “condi-
tions,” internal and otherwise, being calcu-
lated to provide a nice group of pocket con-
stituencies for Red members. And there
would assuredly be nothing unconstitutional
about unlimited paper money. It is a com-
mon and comfortable saying that Australia
will never have a revolution, but it is pos-
sible to have a revolution which is no tech-
nical revolution, and yet has all the worst
earmarks and consequences. And in the
day of triumph a mild, plump and constitu-
tional house-ageift, who has been playing
with fire and Red Objectives, may find
himself driven to do dreadful things, or else
lose his political head, to say nothing of
his house-agency. The two Red crowds are
differentiated by the fact, among others, that
the bloodshedders lack the astuteness to see
much hope of a front place among the con-
stitutionalists, while the constitutional Reds
don’t want a front place at any barricade.
The pleasing feature about the real Com-
munists is that their methods tend to make
them tangible. If they start their Com-
mune in the orthodox way, and come pour-
ing along with all the panoply of war, any-
body may legally and constitutionally fife
his gun into the thickest of them. On the
other hand he couldn’t fire his gun at Lang
without breach of the peace, and possibly
contravention of the Dog Act. All which
considerations lead to no conclusions in par-
ticular save that: (1) There has never be-
fore been a Red Government in any part of
the British Empire; (2) there is going
to be one soon, unless the Objective is a
ridiculous “dud,” for Labor will drift back
to office in due time while the community
is asleep; and (3) the results can hardly
avoid being- interesting.
A NEW HOPE?
Appalling as is the disaster that has over-
taken Japan, it is early days yet to decide
whether the catastrophe will solve or inten-
sify Japan’s most urgent problem, the
pressure of an increasing population upon
the means of subsistence. As far as the
economic loss is concerned, the amazing
prosperity of France is witness to what two
or three years of only comparative peace can
do to restore ravages. It is quite possible
that the wholesale destruction of the huge,
shambling slums which, rather than the im-
posing foreign-style business quarters, were
the real cities of Yokohama and Tokio, will
give such a stimulus to national industry and
effort that the new Japan will outdistance
the old in a very short space of time.
I can still feel the black wave of depres-
sion which overwhelmed me when I first
landed in Japan and wandered through the
streets of Kobe as its industrial workers
were pouring from their homes towards the
factories. I had come in quest of the
country of Lafcadio Hearn, and from
Kobe I went to Osaka and from Osaka to
Kyoto without finding it. It was not till
I had fled to the sacred island of Miyajima,
where the ancient picture is kept more or
less unsullied, that I was able to find an
approximation to the orthodox conception.
There is a murky grandeur in the great
brick hives of European industry; the piti-
ful congeries of flimsy wooden shelters which
house the industrial population of Japan
suggest a tribe of helpless children entrapped
by an ogre. These incredible * dwellings,
which at first sight are apt to be mistaken
for woodsheds or wash-houses, each consists
of one room, with a five-foot door and a
single window. For sanitary purposes
every community of a hundred is supplied
with an open pit, and there are two public
taps for every 1300. When the juvenile in-
habitants of these death-traps die, they are
put into boxes and burned at the public ex-
pense. Yet these tenements are palaces
compared with the tunnel-slums of Tokio.
These travesties of human homes consist of
rows of 12 or 20 compartments, arranged
like sleeping-carriages on a railway train,
and each compartment contains families of
four or five persons. In this arrangement
there is even less privacy than there is in
a Dyak long-house, as each compartment
opens into the next, and between the separate
rows of tunnels there is a space of only
18 inches. It is from such quarters that
girls and boys emerge to work 70 or 80 hours
a week in the modern' factories. There are
actually landlords to own these hovels, and
they are profiteering landlords, too, since
they have not scrupled to increase the rent
m recent years by 300 per cent.
The population question is not at all a
question of whether Japan can replace the
lives she has lost. The latest researches of
biology enable us to get a clearer view of
the phenomena involved and help to dispel a
lot of ancient misconceptions. Animal fecun-
dity, human or otherwise, is always immensely
greater than its- fertility. If there were no
oyster-wars, oyster-earthquakes, famines and
pestilences, then the great-great-grand-
children of a single oyster would number
3b with 33 noughts after it. The elephant
is the slowest breeder amongst mammals, and
yet if all the progeny of an elephant-couple
survived there would be 90 million descend-
ants, in less thah a thousand years. If
one can imagine a nation of a million people,
half male and half female, all compelled to
marry before they were 20 and permitted to
produce only two children, of opposite sexes,
and then made to commit suicide after the
birth of their children, one has conceived of
a people whose numbers would remain
fixed from one generation to another. If,
however, each couple were allowed to have
an extra half a baby, then in a century the
population would have increased to
3,050,000. If another half-baby were
added the population would 'multiply to
nearly eight millions, and if four children
were allowed it would increase to 32 mil-
lions. If the family allowance were
increased to five per couple, then our hypo-
thetical nation of a million people would in
a hundred years multiply to nearly a hundred
millions, and that nation would probably
have to expand its territories or perish.
Luckily, human history shows that these
terrific statistics are never realised. When
there is need for an increase in population
the increase occurs almost automatically,
and generally stops when the economically
desirable figure is attained. Wars have
been blamed or praised for restricting popu-
lation ; but the countries which have waged
the most wars often show the greatest in-
crease. Famine, floods, pestilences and
other natural catastrophes have also been
alleged in explanation of the phenomenon.
China suffers in a superlative degree from
all these, yet the wastage is always very
easily replaced. If these were the only
checks it is obvious human fecundity would
long ago have made the globe uninhabitable.
The cdntrol of human reproductive forces
has plainly not depended on irregular fac-
tors. It has been a conscious process
operating in every tribe which valued its
heritage of noble living, in the hut of every


sturdy peasant whose fields have fed gen-
erations of decent families. It bas taKen
; i hundred forms, as abortion, contracep
(ion, infanticide and abstention, but the de
liberate and voluntary restriction ot the size
of the family in the interests of the general
well-being has been its guiding motive.
What, then, are the causes of oyer-popu-
lation V For over-population certainly does
occur, sometimes as a temporary phase anti
sometimes as an abiding national character-
istic. It is possible that India is o\ er
populated, but comparisons with Europe are
beside the question. In Europe 2M peop e
to the square mile are considered the leasiDi
maximum in agricultural areas. ). u . Ln ia >
owing to the lower standard of living,- a
thousand people can accommodate themselves
on the same area. China is the clearest e -
ample of over-population. In that country
contraceptive methods are frowned upon, it
is a moral duty to bear children. At the
same time, the population only relatively
responded until recently to that incentive.
To-day there is an orgy of reproduction,
with the result that population now presses
upon subsistence. Female infanticide is
practised, but the trouble has gone too tar
for it to be a remedy. It only removes
those surplus mouths for which there is no
food whatever, leaving the remainder in the
half-starved condition which lias become
chronic with them. Here we find the true
cause of over-population. The people have
lost hope. Any standard of living which
may once have existed is submerged m a
sea of misery. The community descends
perceptibly in the scale of civilisation, until
it reaches a stage where neither hope nor
fear operate to make it worth anybody s
while to restrict the frenzy of reproduction.
In countries, however, which still have hope,
vigor and ambition, the standard of a decent
existence is jealously guarded, and as soon
as it is endangered measures are taken, not
at public meetings, in pious resolution or
legislative acts, but in every home, to redress
the balance. Imperial designs have.no in-
fluence on the process. French mothers
remain indifferent to the fervent appeals and
the dire threats of French patriots; and
private conviction supports them, whatever
public opinion may have to say about it.
The application of all this to Japan’s case
is obvious. If reconstruction in the stricken
country means merely the replacing of the
old slums with new slums, if the need for
greater production is translated into longer
hours and shorter pay, if the mothers of the
next generation are still to work 14 to lb
hours a day, then the problem of the Pacific
may well be intensified, for a people without
hope will be a prolific people. If, on the
other hand, the nascent Liberalism and the
struggling trades unionism of Japan seize the
opportunity which is in front of them and
try to create a society with a standard ot liv-
ing which is worth preserving, then Japanese
mothers and Japanese fathers will endeavor
to preserve it by taking into their own com-
petent hands the problem of the Japanese
birth-rate.

Persons who needed a British soldier or

In theorv King George exercises even

nowers which ante-date the period when, m
Coke’s phrase. Henry VIII. became a
noble hieroglyphic of the Crown.” In prac-
tice a modern king, like a modern Governor,
must act in all things on the advice of his
Ministers. Not only is a Governor expected
to refrain from overt acts of a political
nature- he may not make any remark that
can be distorted into the expression of a
political opinion. The late Governor David-
son aroused a storm ot exasperated protest
amongst the professional loyalists of the
National party by stating the apparently in-
nocuous truism that Labor had shown itself
“loyal ” This was taken to be an interfer-
ence in party politics—the theory of certain
hefty young anti-Laborites who shirked the
war and of certain elderly anti-Laborites
who’made fortunes out of it, being that their
side has a monopoly tof the Empire spirit.
There is reason at the back even of such
pieces of effrontery as this. Referees are
not wanted at Government House. De-
cisions on political issues, even chance re-
marks that may be taken to savor of deci-
sions, are fiercely resented. The King of
England—who was born in the country oyer
which he rules, has lived there all his life,
and has been intensively educated in its
political and constitutional practices—is foi
bidden to thrust his knowledge upon the iukis
of the State. Why, then, should that faint
shadow of a king, an imported Governor, who
knows nothing of his temporary realm be-
yond what he has been able to pick up m
his vear or so of office, be encouraged to pre-
sent himself as a despot, “exercising great
power with discrimination, but without bias
and without fear”? Actually, he b what
this daily paper, which upholds his outworn
office, says “no Governor worth the name
should be” —a “rubber-stamp. And rubber-
stamps are over-dear at £lO,OOO a year these
hard rimes.
Australian Marketing in England.
From David Berry, a London authority on
markets and marketing:—
“L. Ree” (B. 5/7/’23) disapproves of my sugges-
tion (B. 14/6/’2S) for an Australian export bonus
instead of a British tariff preference to develop
Australian trade with Britain. He suggests that
Britons could reduce their costs of living by re-
moving or lowering the duty on Australian dried
fruits. That would mean transferring the duty
to other commodities, for the same amount of taxa-
tion would have to be found, and it is doubtful
whether Australian dried fruits would be any lower
in price with the duty removed or reduced. He is
sarcastic about my disclosure of the too-heavy taxa-
tion on Britons at home. Doubtless he cannot
envisage anybody in a worse economic plight than
himself. He is possibly one of the men who have
been taught by uncommercial politicians to look
to the “rich uncle” to give him a fresh loan
every time he has to pay off the old one, instead of
meeting it by honest taxation. He is certainly one
of the men who think that Britain still
possesses somewhere a long and inexhaustible stock-
ing. The sooner he loses that idea the better.
Several thousand millions sterling of war and other
debts are owing to Britain, which none the less is
the only . nation on earth making a really serious ,
effort to pay its external debt. If all the nations
that owe money to Britain Were to begin merely
paying the interest on it there would be more
income in Britain to tax, and the present income-
tax of 4s. fid. in the £1 could be reduced by Is.
in the £l. The big saving would enable Britons
to stimulate their trade, absorb a part of their
huge army of unemployed, and consume more goods
——including foodstuffs from Australia. Britons at
home bore the greatest strain of the Woild War -
naval, military and financial —and to-day, by way
of compensation, they are allowed to bear the
brunt of the world’s economic strain, including the
pinching and the starving to live. Yet “L. Ree,”
instead of thoroughly examining proposals showing
how Australia could help herself and Britain, too,
wants the overloaded Briton to carry a still heavier
burden, merely in order that residents of Australia,
Maoriland, Canada and South Africa may have a
still easier time.
Australian dried fruits are making headway because
they are better in quality than Greek or Californian.
But to get a firmer grip Australian exporters must
grade for color as well as size, and they must ram
home their superiority by- an effective publicity
scheme. The Greeks are feeling the draught blowing
on - them from Australia, for their London selling
organisation, in order to try a bluff or a check, is
seeking at the moment of writing to levy a trade
“t a x” of 2 p.c. on; all Australian dried fruits sold
bv British dealers as a condition of supplying them
with the Greek stuff that, in quantity at any rate,
still dominates the market! Heavier supplies from
Australia, graded as suggested, and • landed at a
market price by aid of the suggested export bonus,
would hit the Greeks still further, and make the
Californians sit up. It was a n Englishman, a strong
Imperialist, who organised the British market for the
Greeks before Australia took to exporting currants
and raisins. There are to-day keen business brains
in London, British and Australian, anxious and
determined to help Australia to get a firmer hold
on the market. They are commercial men who know
the markets thoroughly, and who should be trusted
to handle the trade without State interference be-
yond the assistance of the bonus.
Australia’s canned fruit supply to Britain every
vear is equal to about 10 or 12 days’ consumption.
■To wet the millions of pounds that annually find
their way from Britain to California, Australian
eanners and exporters need something more even than
a bonus. The Californians have, got the bulk of
the British market because, first, they have studied
its requirements thoroughly; and, secondly, they have
an efficient selling organisation in London that in-
sists on their exporters sending only a consistent! v
high standard of fruit- California’s best cannot beat
Australia’s best, and if Australian eanners will get
together and insist that all their exports shall be of
the highest grade rigidly maintained, putting a
heavy hand on the less efficient and indifferent, they
can win the British market. Empire sentiment will
swing the market in their favor. Australian laboi
asCi i St i„ the fight—to their own and Bntisn
labor’s ultimate benefit—by withholding any further
demands for wage increases in the orchards and ca -
neries for a period of three to five years 1 recently-
read an extract from a speech at a meeting of the
Californian exporters’ organisation stating t - A
would have to improve their methods still furthe
to retain their export trade. M ho are they afr.ud
of? Obviously, Australia. _ ,
Some eanners who have sent inferior stuff to
Britain from Australia in the last few years, to g
no further back, have rendered their great country
a costlv disservice, the effect of which can only be
wiped out by the setting up and maintenance_of
high standard of quality, guaranteed and rigidly
Thread in The Bulletin that Australia took
£26,000,000 worth of goods in one year Horn the
United States, and sent only .feG OOO’OOO worth
return Might I suggest that this £-0,000,000
balance be closely overhauled by Australian com-
mercial men, free from party politics to see how
much of it can be diverted to Britain? Any piac-
Hcal suggestions that would result in increasing
Britain’s exports to Australia would inevitably lead
to greater demands in Britain for Australian expons
bv the ordinary process of trade exchange.

The Ma State’s Railways.
w nv South Wales railways represent 851
millioiis of the State’s borrowings, and
tramways stand for 9| millions;the ot ler
qo millions are invested in jobs, frauds, ocm
merits and sundries. So the railways are
the most solid and tangible assets that good
ij lyr,. has to show for liabilities that aie
fast apjroaching "The £200,000,000 mark
Tliev now comprise, barring any increas*
since the just-issued annual report was
written, 5318 miles of line. Of this total 3134
miles comprising 54 separate lines or sec-
tions’ don’t pav working expenses and inter-
est and 27 of the 54 don’t even pay working
expenses The biggest bulk loser, the good
old Demondrille-Blayney concern, dropped
£123,004 inside the 12 months; while the
most interesting losers by measurement were
the Lidcome-Regent’s Park and 1 assilern-
Toronto branches, which each lost over ioOUU
per mile in the same time. One interesting
investment, a 6i-mile fragment in the
neighborhood of Tottenham, earned £OB and
lost £ll5B, while another, in the Cobar
country, earned nothing and lost £l7. <5-
There were 84 more miles of money-losing
track last year than in the year before, and
the loss (£1,106,881, or £353 3s. Bd. per mile)
was £108,464 more. During the 12 months six
new lines or bits, equal to 203 miles, were
opened for traffic. Two of them are just
paying expenses, but not interest on then-
cost. The other four pay neither working
expenses nor interest. The loss was
£61778, with hopes of more when a full
year’s figures are available. Needless to say,
none of them made a new port available to
save the remote farmer the cost of some or
the interminable distances. The report
laments considerably about the drought; but,
then it is the policy of the Department to
beguile settlers out into the drought by build-
ing lines to the Never-Never country, pro-
vided it is that part of the Never-Never
which is so placed that it must trade with
Sydney or not trade at all. It is also the
policy to discourage settlement in the better-
watered coast country north and south by
refusing it the use of any port save Sydney,
which is often too far away to make the
growing of things a payable business, bo
the Department deserves any drought that
may come its way. Five years railway-
building at the pace which the single State
of N.S.W. accomplishes as a matter otcouise
would complete the South-to-North railway,
make the Northern Territory available for
settlement by bringing it within halt-a-weeks
journey of a big settled population, open a
new short route to Europe and Asia and
begin to make an end of the 1 . T wl li t » hed T
dreary gag about the “Empty North. In
fact the scraps of railway (mostly money-
tetag scra“4 which N.S.W. has built in the
last dozen years would not only fill in the
missing link but suffice for a whole
transcontinental route from sea to sea. ret
parochial Pumblechooks invariably talk or
this simple but all-important work as some-
thing really beyond the capacity of the whole
Commonwealth, and almost too staggering loi
the Empire, if the Empire was moved to take
a hand at it. It is to the credit ot the
N S W. Commissioners that they actually
made the system as a whole pay its ™ay--
bv the plain and inevitable process ot chai»
ing up the losses of the increasing array o
bad lines to the better ones. Wherefore these
results appear:—
Average Charge per Ton per 100 Miles.
1918 .. 7s. 9 cl. j 1921' .. 9s. 2d.
1919 .. 7s. lid. | 1922 .. 11s. 6d.
1920 .. Bs. 9d. i 192 d ... 13s. 4d.
It isn’t the kind of thing that encourages
“settlement” —in the country, anyhow. In
fact N.S.W. Statistician Smith, reckons that
the Ma State had 1,348,987 fewer acres
under crop in 1922 than in the record year
(1916), and 4700 less people engaged in
rural industries of all sorts than m the
record year (1912). Still, if damphool rail-
ways are persistently built in damphool
places by damphool politicians who are out
for advertisement and votes, and the work is
done with money borrowed when the puce
of money is sky-high, someone must be the
victim paying.
A New Idea in Centralisation.
Profoundly inspired by what is supposed
to be the near prospect of shifting the
Federal Parliament to Canberra, 1 oderal
Minister Chapman has inaugurated a move-
ment for getting all the Parliaments theie.
He proposes that Australia should be one
dominion, with a single Legislature,
programme allows for municipal bodies ot
on? sort or another, but the intermediate
bodies—the State Legislatures—are to go.
There being no more States the equal repre-
sentation of them in the Senate must go too
The plea advanced is that there wdl be a
"reat saving of money 7 if all Australia s
managed from a head office—as the Northern
Territory is now. The Territory, with no
Parliament to pay, and a mere civil servant
instead of a Governor and all the blessings
of centralisation which Australia enjoyed a
century ago and is to enjoy again i
Chapmans can bring it about, is, however,
run at about six times the average cost per
inhabitant of the States. This awtul result
is partly because the population leaves, the
unified, centralised place, but the liabilities
don’t. The next bright example of advance-
ment and economy should be found m VV est-
ralia. With only about one-thirty-sixth the
amount of Parliament and Governor to the
mile that Tasmania pays for, things
might reasonably be expected of Westialia.
The visible result is that the place costs
twice as much per inhabitant ( nearly £-3
vearly) to run as Tasmania does, and oU
per cent, more than the States’ average.
And in the way of attracting country settlers
on to its vast areas this State, which is, bar the
N Territory, the nearest thing we have to
the embodiment of Chapman’s centralisation
dream, is away down at the bottom ot evei -
thiiig The prospect of making all Australia
save a bit round the capital another
N. Territory, or. even another Westralia, is
therefore unattractive.

The Draggled “Mother of Parliaments.”
Sydney Telegraph, which has a large
capacity for not suggesting a remedy, spoke
a few words the other day on “Assembly
Manners,” and then gave the matter up.
There is probably no worse mannered gathering
• \xmvlrl than a meeting of the -Legisiaiiv e
in nf N S Wales. Members of it lie about
with the soles of their feet facing
T,c hamioer the roo f, and the House
blv not be, etc., etc.? . ACi
That question was being asked more than 40
vears ago; but nothing lias been done, and
nothing seems any nearer being done,, and
anyone* who suggests the doing of anything is
still reSrded by pedants as a pernicious
sample of the wild folk who want to take
•‘heroic measures,” and rush in , before the
time is rioe.” But, though nothing is done,
several things have been suggested. One, is
that a candidate shall be a person who has
passed an examination in the English lan-
guage, in history, political economy and the
rudiments of Australian law. If it is held,
as it has been in the past, that proof of the
possession of expert knowledge Quite need-
less in the case of a lawmaker, then, for the
sake of consistency, it should be made
necessary also in the case of a Judge,
one time the difficulty of the ignorant legis-
lator was got over in part by having mem-
hers with a property qualification. home 01
them were dismal samples of bigotry, ancl
few were sorry specimens of human empti
ness; but the majority had a fair education
simply because they had money with which to
buy knowledge, and leisure to acquire i •
When the nefarious property qualification
for members was abolished, an educations
test should have taken its place; but un-
happily it didn’t. Another proposed im-
provement is the total prohibition of the
secret elections known as pre-selections, wi n
their corruption, bribery, stuffed ballots, am
general reversion to the worst days and ways
of political roguery. They tend to limit the
popular choice to the most thick-skinned, loi
the atmosphere where pre-selection is in its
highest state of development is repellent to
the better type of citizen, and p arliament
itself is becoming hardly less repellent, home
good might be done if ‘‘privilege was abo -
ished. At present one member can say
things about another inside the House which
would be civilly and criminally actionable it
said outside. If, as between members, the
inside of the House was made the same as
the outside, and subject to the same code o
good manners, a change would be bound to
become noticeable. And a fine disciplinary
effect: should be produced if, when the lion,
but unbearable member for Patterson s Curse
had to be removed, the same as if he was
time-payment furniture in arrear, the re-
moval was for seven days, no smaller sen-
tence being allowed, and included, as a mat-
ter of course, the loss of seven days’ wages.
Some vigorous reforms on these lines might
easilv make the draggled and intoxieated-
looking “mother of Australian Parliaments a
model institution, instead of there being no
worse mannered gathering in the world. l>ig
reform has to be achieved by heroic measures.
Matters don’t tend to improve of themselves.
Rather things tend the wrong way, and man,
except that he may progress in luxury, is
really a downward animal. When affairs
become very bad with some section or insti-
tution of man there is, with luck, a heroic
reformation and an uplift, failing which that
particular human section or institution goes
over the cliff. In Australia there is quite
a perceptible movement for the abolition ot
State Parliaments, to be followed by the last
possible thing in the way of retrogression—
an attempt to govern a whole continent by a
coterie of Parliamentary engineers, gathered
in a hamlet set among the by-ways of the old
Ma State. It is in its origin aN. S. Wales
movement, mainly because the accumulated
rottenness of 40 o'r more years, and tne_steadj
increase of incapacity, have made I arlia-
mentary government there a matter of special
contempt. It stands none too high in other
States, for the loan habit lias made the
people sluggish of mind like drug fiends, and
has sapped their self-reliance to the limit;
but by fairly general agreement Old Legisla-
tive Mother is over the odds.
Bootlegging in Australia.
In the U.S.A. the attempt to make the
nation sober by prohibition has resulted m
many becoming drunkards who would
have remained sober under the old regime,
and in a small way the same phenomenon is
to be observed in various parts of this coun-
trv Early closing and the jazz craze have
combined to bring this to pass. In pre-wai
days a man did not think of liquor beroie
starting for a public or semi-public function.
Easy access to a reasonable amount ot now-
ing bowl was taken for granted. 1 heatre
patrons who wanted a refresher between the
acts were accommodated at handy bars,
while at club or other dances, m town halls
and the like, spirits were provided in rooms
set apart for the purpose and patronised only
by males. For the rest the guests were
offered weak claret-cup during the dances,
and if the affair was particularly expensive,
champagne in limited quantities at suppei.
Half a bottle of wine per guest was recog-
nised as the maximum if deplorable scenes
were to be avoided. Under this arrangement
practically none but dipsomaniacs . became
alcoholic casualties. Six o’clock closing gave
birth to the theatre flask and the habit oi
taking it neat instead of with soda. # When
jazzing became an almost nightly affair with
a large section (a Sydney daily remarked
last week that it is a dull business girl these
times who does not jazz at least twice
a week), the control of dancing passed
largely from the hands of private ball com-
mittees into those of business men and
women. With the change came an altered
outlook on the drink question. The hosts
and hostesses of the past had been concerned
from every point of view, to supply as nttl.
as possible of the cup that inebriates. the
dance-hall, dance-cafe and night-club specu-
lators found that it paid to provide as much
drink at extravagant prices as was com-
patible with keeping their concerns sobei
enough to escape the attentions of the police.
The farce known as “ordering the stuff be-
fore 6 o’clock” can be performed over a
telephone, by special-messenger delivery, or
otherwise, and in cases where the patron is
known it may be dispensed with altogether.
In those not infrequent cases where the
supervising police are known, the gestuie
mav be dispensed with by dancers who are
unknown. The liquor is brought to the place
of revelry in motor-cars, or stored ready loi
use with the owners’ names attached. Neces-
sarilv, a certain risk is involved, and, as m
the U.S., the drinker lias to pay the price
Many dancers are naturally anxious to avoid
this- and for the purpose the theatre flask
is brought into play. It is not necessary for
the purposes of the present writing to take
more than one aspect of the theatre-flask
convention in its application to jazz-halls. A
decade ago the social male did not carry
whisky or brandy in his hip pocket, because
he could get it at dances without impairing
the appearance of his clothes. His partner
could quench her thirst with a mixture
which, unless doctored was incapable of
producing intoxication if swallowed by the
bucket Nowadays, at nine-tenths of the re-
sorts frequented by the festive young the
ladv’s choice lies between wine or whisky
bought at hotel prices, and theatre-flask
spirits in the possession of a male friend.

Some girls are capable of nipping strong
drink, evening after evening, and emerging
from the conflict with an engagement-ring
and no craving for alcohol. Others, again,
are resolute enough to refuse to drink under
any circumstances, and to go on doing it.
There is a residue, however, and a big one,
composed of girls and women who, in such
circumstances, become whisky-addicts as
readily as they would become cocaine or
morphia-addicts if drugs were continually
pushed at them. These are among the vic-
tims of our present instalment of prohibi-

Titles.
Last week, for the first time in the history
of N. S. Wales, the Assembly declared by a
substantial majority (39 votes to 24) “that
the granting of titles is contrary to the
sentiment of the people, and that the resolu-
tion be conveyed to the King through the
Governor.” That a motion of the sort was
not passed years ago, and acted upon by
the Imperial authorities, is only to say that
Parliament in some respects is thoroughly
unrepresentative. Ninety-nine electors out
of every hundred regard the local traffic in
knighthoods with the measure of favor they
accord a doubtful drain. Excluding the
war knighthoods, which had nothing to do
with the politicians, almost every major deco-
ration of the last 10 years in N. S. Wales
has gone either to a nonentity or to a person
of unsavory reputation. The reason is that,
with a few exceptions, the “honors” were
bought. The bribe usually takes the form
of a donation to the Nationalist party funds,
though individual high officials with a pull at
Gowning-street may also have to be “en-
couraged’ to do their best. Labor has not
been above raising the wind on such lines
m the pastand it may fairly be suspected
or only striking its fine attitude now because,
for various good reasons, there is never likely
to be a tenth as much profit for Macdoneil
House in K.8.E.-hawking as there is for the
National Club. It may be said that the citi-
zens m general are not injured, while great
parties may be saved from insolvency, under
tins system of selecting persons for the high-
est distinction not on their merits but by
reference to th e size of the bribes they are
prepared to pay. The answer is that any
convention which places a smear of corrup-
tion on the people’s Government is an
affront to the people, and a wrong to the
,^ e wishes of Australia were con-
siffted by its Parliaments similar resolutions
to that carried in the N. S. Wales Assemblv
would be passed in every State House of the
Commonwealth and by the Federal Parlia-
ment. But this is not likely to occur unless,
as m the N. S. Wales case, by accident. The
Pi 11 '*-/ machines—and particularly the
Nationalist machines—will see to that.
Tawdry Modernness.
*?• *''• Ci.iffwell on a sign of the times:
Education lias run a little mad. Atop of world-
wide troubles, resulting from the rise to noise, if
not to fame, of the half-educated in Egypt, South
Africa and India, comes frequent and recurring news
of schemes (usually fathered by those well-meaning
mischief-makers the missionaries) to carry schools
(and it may be presumed Sunday-schools) through
the territory of the warlike Masai in Central Africa,
and to multiply higher schools throughout China.
Despite Commonwealth immigration restriction
measures, the number of American negroes—or, at
any rate, tinted Americans and British Americans
to be seen in Australian city streets is growing.
With horn-rimmed or rimless pince-nez, smartly
(sometimes flashly) cut clothes, white vest-slips,
yellow gloves, swagger-sticks, stylish hats and colored
silk handkerchiefs peeping just the correct distance
from breast pockets, they are average “men about
town” in everything but face and the size of hands
and feet. The Masai warriors of 20 years hence!
Now, a Masai buck on his native heath and in
the traditional costume of his tribe is a dignified
figure, even though his costume be little more than
his shining black skin. So is the Chinese, the Japanese,
the Indian, the Australian aborigine, the national
of any country which carries its race in its features
or color. Put him in European garb, and he becomes
a figure of fun when he is not a figure of tragedy
the tragedy of a lost dignity. Is there anything
more pathetic than Binghi in the dirty denims and
lousy flannel undershirt of so-called civilisation?
Education has hastened too fast. Spread without
sufficient forethought and with no ordered plan among
the “new-caught, sullen peoples,” it carries the
brand of the pinchbeck and the tawdry. It has
spread before it and its recipients are ready. Its
signs arouse the subconscious antagonism and con-
tempt of the originator for the imitator. Sensed
by the imitators, the antagonism stirs antagonism;
the contempt breeds the hatred of envy—envy for
the not quite attainable.
Compulsory education of their own people among
more advanced Caucasian nations has made for
general betterment, but it has brought its problems.
The biggest one is that of the half-educated—youths
tossed out into the world with learning only enough
to enable them to read titles at the “pictures,”
the race-columns of the dailies and the frothy stuff
served up in their “class” papers; to have “high
notions” about their place in human destiny, and
to have a dislike of being biddable; amenability to
discipline, moral or industrial, being classed as
weakness. They are not educated enough to know
that they don’t know, the worst ignorance of all.
These half-learned are at the root of most of the
troubles of the modern social state. They make more
difficult all industrial, political and social problems.
They are the drag on the ideal of an educated
democracy. These men and women, however, have
in more advanced nationalities (such as those which
make up the British commonwealth of dominions
and the higher European peoples) the advantage of
inheriting a centuries-old freedom and appreciation
of the relative fitness of things necessary to con-
tinue an ordered social state. Other peoples have
not —especially those which have suddenly had their
centuries-engrafted Orientalism veneered with a film
of Westernness, put on in the same unforeseeing
way as their devastating European or American
clothes. The new knowledge is all top-hamper. Its
roots are in sand.
So arise the unrests which seethe in India, Egypt,
New China, California, British Columbia, Natal, the
Southern States of U.S.A. —wherever a white civili-
sation has been plastered upon a colored stock. A
sermon and a prayer for White Australia!
Education, of course, must be. The world will
never, willingly, go back to the excesses, the cruel-
ties, the bestialities which were noi'mal among the
peoples “half-devil and half-child - ’ the white man
feels it is his burden to upraise; but the new khow-
ledge has been conferred without judgment. Britain,
the greatest coloniser and greatest manager of sub-
ject and ignorant peoples, is most to blame ; for the
Briton is not imaginative—especially that Briton
who marches in the van of altruistic pioneering,
the missionary, and drags the other pioneer, the trade
agent, in bis wake. His first thought is to put
the rescued into English clothes and to set him
down to English schoolbooks —and so swelled head
sets in.
Before the problem of the half-educated colored
man becomes too big to handle, a grip should be
THE REFERENDUM IN QUEENSLAND.
THE TEAPOT: "Here, I haven't got to heat two people, have I?"
THE REFEREE : Too true, you have. If you knock out Pint Pot, you've got to face Sly
Grog. And nobody has ever knocked him out yet."
taken of the education problem as it affects inferior
peoples. Not a cheap imitation of the European
must be the aim in view; but for each people whose
destiny is entrusted to (or, as is more often the
case, has been adopted by) an educating and uplift-
ing’ nation, an ideal adapted to the people marked
for benefit; leading them to a betterment within
themselves, not to one intended for a quite different
race and civilisation. The world would then be saved
from the spectacle of “imitation white men” which
now represents the high-water mark of modern cul-
ture among non-Caucasians emancipated from native
ignorance.
And, above all, cultured or non-cultured colored
nationals must be kept out of high-idealed homo-
geneous Australia. Never was a nation so fortunate
in having around it so many examples of what to
avoid.
“Fifty Per Cent. Australian.”
On one of the neglected industries:—
The Brisbane Diggers have set an inspiring example
to other branches of their organisation, the
R.S.S.I.L.A. When the Tariff Board visited .their
city they sent along a deputation, with the request
that Australia should be freed from the vicious
foreign monopoly of the moving-picture market. Kerr,
M.L.A., who was a lieutenant in the A.1.F., spoke in
favor of a fifty-fifty arrangement, as in Germany,
where for every foreign film allowed in a native film
has to be exported. “Let ‘5O per cent. Australian!'
be our motto,” said Major Maddocks. The chairman
of the Board promised “serious consideration” of the
branch’s request, adding that he “realised the meed
for more Australian films,” and fewer of “the per-
nicious productions now being screened.”
There was a counter-deputation of “film-renters,”
and another of showmen. One of the former asserted
that the American film-producing companies have
no interest whatever in the screening of pictures in
ustralia. ’ They may have no interest in the screen-
Vl g ’. ln the sense that they don’t • own cinema
heatres, but they have a whole lot of interest in
the pictures. That was revealed by Massy Greene,
when Minister of Customs, in giving his “reasons” for
he non-imposition of an ad, valorem, duty. Among
other things Greene protested his inability to assess
the value of films imported by companies “whose
parent houses are in America,” and which “remitted
all profits to the parent house.” One of these com-
panies, and that the largest in the trade, recently
invited the pubile to believe that it was as “per-
meated with the Australian spirit” as the Digger
himself. A Sydney M.L.A. came back with the state-
ment that 9708 of its 10,000 shares were held by a
New York corporation, and 50 by its American-born
manager, whereupon the subject was dropped.
A positive copy of a foreign picture, advertised in
Australia as “a million-dollar film,” may be struck
off in the country of origin for £4 or £5 per
1000 ft. Arrived at Sydney, and ready for exhibition,
subject to the Censor’s scissors, it is passed through
the Customs on payment of £6 ss. per 1000 ft.
Thus the duty on a positive of Chaplin's four-reeler
“The Pilgrim,” which, on top of its huge American
profits, will pull in thousands of pounds in Aus-
tralia, would amount to £23 at the outside. Hence
the impossibility of producing Australian pictures
on any large scale. Not only is foreign stuff allowed
in at a rate of duty which amounts to a legalised
fraud on the taxpayer (the last Commonwealth Par-
liament ratified the impudent swindle, although
Blakeley, Mahony, Riley and Dr. Maloney pro-
tested against it), but the crudely-framed Common-
wealth and State income-taxes fall lightly on the
Australian profits of Chaplin, Fairbanks, Mary
Pickpord, Adolph Zuker, Carl Laemmle, and
other foreigners who have never seen Australia;
heavily on those of distinguished native-born enter-
tainers like Melba and Oscar Ascpie, w’ho spend
their money in the country. Ad valorem duties
on oil-paintings and the like have helped to estab-
lish a profitable market for the Australian artist,
who, in many cases, used to have to go abroad to
earn a living. Ad valorem duties on cinematograph
films would be correspondingly beneficial to native
talent in the moving-picture field, and the financial
results would be immeasurably greater. Most of
the Australian screen-actors and -actresses who have
made good in America were employed in this country
by the J- 0. Williamson firm. Potential equals or
betters may be working for the same firm (cer-
tainly the typical Williamson chorus-girl has a lot
more dash and charm than the average Yankee film-
lady), but in the absence of Protection, such as
the Australian artist enjoys, there is lack of oppor-
tunity. The Williamson concern is associated with
a film-importing and exhibiting amalgamation in
which, according to its own statement, over three
millions are invested. Two years ago this amal-
gamation announced that it was building “three
million-dollar theatres,” in addition to the 80-odd it
already controlled; also, that it owned, at Rush-
cutter’s Bay, Sydney, in “a situation ideal for the
making of motion-pictures,” the “finest studio and
laboratory in the Southern Hemisphere.” Having
installed such an outfit —one capable of being used
for “every known method of animated photo-play, and
of coping with the requirements of the biggest
casts” it had decided “to locally produce films in
a big way. Not (of course) with the object of mak-
ing money, but with the idea of encouraging Austra-
lian talent and industry.” This noble design has
not been realised. The zeal of the high-minded
authors has doubtless been chilled by the discovery
that there is no ad valorem dutg or restriction on
imports. Parliament should repair the omission.
•
A week or two ago old-age pensions were in-
creased a few shillings a fortnight by order
of the Commonwealth Parliament; where-
upon the living allowances granted to aged
parents of soldiers who died in the Great
War were cut down by a corresponding
amount. It was a paltry thing to do, and
all the more paltry because the total num-
ber of people affected cannot be more than
about 200. Evidence of the dependence of
these parents upon their soldier sons was
given when the son made over an allotment
to them ; and it was considered a fair thing,
when the soldier died, to grant a living allow-
ance as a supplement to the Old Age Pen-
sion, in order to supply a comfort the parents
might have enjoyed if the soldier had lived.
The additional grant of pension was made to
meet a recognised advance in the cost of
living; but, in effect, Repat. says that, while
every other sort of old-age pensioner shall
benefit, the parent of the dead soldier shall
not. Whoever conceived the brilliant idea
is out of place in that department; and if
the Minister who approved of it isn’t by this
time disgusted with its paltriness, it is to be
hoped he soon will be. Or cease to be a
Minister.

“T.P.”: Db. J. A. Leach, president of the
Royal Australasian Ornithologists’ Union, is
stumping Victoria as a ’Varsity extension lec-
turer, organising a crusade against the
iniquitous overseas traffic in our fauna. These
three advertisements in the English Agbicul-
tubal Magazine just to hand should make
every decent Australian look up the nearest
Parliamentary representative, State or
Federal, and kick him into action
(1) 11. E. Rogers, Liverpool, supplies king parra-
keets at £l2 a pair; blue-bonnets (the mallee
“buloke”), at £2O a pair; Port Lincoln parrots,
£lO a pair; crimson parrots (common), ££> a pair.
(2) G. Ik Chapman, London, supplies king parrots
at £5 se. each, or £lO a pair; crimson, 455. each;
Adelaide rosellas, £6 10s. a pair; white cockatoos,
£2 each.
(3) Gamage’s Zoo. Dept., London, announces the
recent arrival of 10 kinds of Australian birds.
How many tens of thousands of our bush-
adorning, life-giving birds died wretched
deaths before these advertisements became
possible? The parrot is one of Australia’s
most gloriously distinctive features, but ex-
perts abroad list 12 species as being “doomed
to early extinction,” and the foreign scalping
parties now at work, under the complaisant
grins of don’t-give-a-dam’ Governments, have
special instructions to, if possible, snare the
lot before our people wake up. In 1913 there
were adequate safeguards, and it was only
recently that bird and beast protectors be-
came aware of the fact that in that year the
regulations were abrogated. Fortunately,
the war paralysed shipping facilities for
the time being. The fur trade, 1919-21.
was responsible for the following skins:
Australian opossum, 4,265,621; ring-tailed
opossum, 1,321,625; native-bear (koala),
208,671; wallaby, 172,588. What has the
native-bear, for instance, done that he should
be so ruthlessly butchered? Leach, in his
capacity of school inspector, has recently
travelled thousands of miles through the
bush of Victoria without seeing a koala,
where _ once there were he
is a highly-trained observer. In the latest
report of the American Museum reference is
made to. the “appalling destruction of mar-
supials in Australia, which is losing its
native animals more rapidly than any other
country.” Won’t Australia do something be-
fore it is too late?
The statement that the N. S. Wales Public
Service Superannuation Fund, though only a
little more than four years old, is rotten and
insolvent, and that the Railway Fund is more
rotten and generally worse, is a surprise by
reason of the magnitude of some of the
figures mentioned, but hardly otherwise. A
previous Public Service Fund, to which con-
tribution was compulsory, came a disgraceful
cropper after 11 years. The Reid Govern-
ment started to cut down the service, and
compensated many of the retrenched out of
the pension fund, which was plain misappro-
priation. When the depleted concern was
almost on its final limbs a rumor went
through the service that repudiation was im-
minent. At this crisis an offer was made
that public officials might cease to contribute
if they forfeited their pensions, in which
case they would, when they left the service,
get back the amount they had actually paid
in, with 3 per cent, simple interest. A great
number made the sacrifice in panic, because
they believed that further subscription was
only paying money to thieves. After that
episode it might almost have been expected
that care would be taken to have the founda-
tions of any future funds sound; but the
habit .of untidiness, procrastination and
financial shortage seems ingrained in politi-
eal circles. And, to make matters worse,
the Australian politician has a queer idea
that the rules of arithmetic don’t apply to
him that two and two will make five when
ho wants them to. Most of the people who get
into Bankruptcy arrive there through that
same obsession. And so do about half of
those who are in gaol.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The abiding lesson of the broken-down
Ruhr occupation is that passive resistance,
considered as a means of defence against a
resolute invader, is worse than useless. Ger-
many gave the thing a thorough trial, and has
abandoned it as an unbearable calamity.
Red Russia would probably have suffered the
same experience if the Allies hadn’t broken
the Hun after Trotsky’s surrender to him at
Brest-Litovski. Yet passive resistance has
been recommended to Australia, by pigeon-
livered cranks who have crept into the Labor
party, as a cheap and effective substitute tor
an army and a navy.
Victoria has floated a £9,000,000 conversion
loan in London, and Treasurer McPherson calls
the operation a “success.” It is a success in
the sense that the bill lias been renewed
for 19 years, with the option of payment in
nine, but McPherson prudently refrains
from going into details. One of the loans
which had to be met was for £‘>,ooo.ooo at
34 p.c.; another for £4,000,000 at 34. p.c.
The rate of interest on the conversion issue
is 5 p.c. and the price £99. Perhaps
McPherson saved a bit by converting a
short-dated post-war loan, on which he has
been paying £6 7s. 4d. p.c., but the whole
transaction will add quite £lOO,OOO p.a. to
the Victorian interest bill; and, in the
absence of the hard economy which the case
insistently calls for, that means so much
extra taxation.
The Fuller Government has been placed in
an awkward position over its defeat on the
resolution against the bestowal of titles. It
would move a rescinding motion if it thought
there was any hope of success. But a
majority of the members, faced with the
brutal obligation to vote on this issue, would
not dare to disclose themselves as favorable
to it. They know that most of their con-
stituents look on the system as snobbery and
foolishness at best, and as a sordid swindle
at worst. By playing for safety National-
ism has (1) to notify the Downing-street
people that N. S. Wales wants no more
titles, and (2) leave it on record that the
people’s House has said so. And a
knighthood has been promised to a recent
Nationalist convert, in the Council for finan-
cial and other services rendered.
Lang, the solemn N.S.W. Labor leader
—the same who, when Treasurer in the
Storey-Dooley Government, increased the
income-tax by £1 p.h. in his first year of
office and who would have tacked on
another £1 p.h. in the second year if the
electors hadn’t intervened —proclaims him-
self a Socialist, and proud of it. “The
A.L.P. welcomes the most vigorous and ad-
vanced Industrialist who works along sane
and practical lines to the socialistic goal,”
he said the other day. About the time he
was saying it Larcombe, one of Theodore’s
lieutenants, announced in the Brisbane Par-
liament that, in working along Government-
railway lines to the socialist goal, the Labor
Ministry had dissipated another £1,495,000.
That was the railway deficit in 1922-23; in
1921-22 it was £1,743,000, and in 1920-21
£1,739,000, the total for eight years of Labor-
rule being £9.902,000. Earnings last year
were 25 p.c. short of expenditure. The
difference came out of the taxes, as usual.
The Lawson-Allan Coalition had a narrow
escape last week of being bumped out on a
snap division, a fate which overtook, the
Bowser Ministry in 1918. And the issue
was no more important than the appointment
of a select committee to inquire into the
Gas Bills. Allan, who is supposedly Law-
son’s equal-in-all-things, was in the Parlia-
mentary Library at, the time, and mistook
the division-bells for a call in the Uppah
Chambah. Superbus Wettenhall, whose in-
clusion in the Cabinet has caused so much
C.P. anger, had gone home; other Liberals
and Cockles were lukewarm or “different.
Dunstan, Downward and Carlisle (Cockles)
and Deany, Morley and Baird (Liberals)
crossed the floor. Lawson won by to
but had Labor been there in full force he
would have been defeated by 27 to» 2d. Of
the dozen Cockies who are allegedly Minis-
terialists only four voted with the Govern-
ment and another who turned against Law-
son was Baird, for whom the Premier took
so many blows in his first Cabinet. Cotter s
interjection “Get the rolls ready!” came as
a nasty reminder to members that Lawson
can claim a dissolution if the numbers are
wrong on the next vital division.
It is a sort of anomaly that, in Australia,
Governments profess to own the railways,
and the aggregate result is always a loss,
while in the United Kingdom they don t own
the railways, and yet the central and local
authorities, in the latest year for which
figures are available (1021), made
£10,800,000 out of them by taxation. It
taxes were made a charge on Australia s
Government lines, just as they would be m
the case of Private Enterprise, the results
ought to be even more interesting than those
we have now.
The Queensland Government has a bill
on hand which will give a well-earned shock,
so far as its territory is concerned, to the
blatant herd of insurance-company pro-
meters. r i?hese parties, mostly operating
under the untidy laws of N.S.W., are a pros-
perous scandal of several years standing. It
is proposed to shut out new proprietary life
offices from the Northern State altogether,
the deposit required from others is to be
multiplied by five (maximum £50,000), and
from fire and marine offices by two (maxi-
mum £20,000), which will give the Treasury
a bit of trust money to play with. But tor
the laziness of Federal Ministries, their
blighted indifference, their lack of dignity
and lack of a sense of duty, the Common-
wealth authority could remind the folk at
THE OLD GATE’S A-SWING.
“At the seven-mile post on the Deniliquin-Moama railway a Victorian Minister for Railways has
cut the first sod of N. S. Wales earth where Victoria will build a railway.
Brisbane that insurance is as much a
Federal affair as customs, paper money and

the grass. But if the Commonwealth does
nothing it can’t, with any show of decency,
prevent a State doing something.
When the N.T. Administrator penned his
last and gloomiest report, the population
totalled 3291 (there were 2252 whites and
1039 of assorted colors), and 12 p.c. were
receiving Government rations. The Darwin
school was a League of Nations in little;
among the pupils were 54 British, 8 Greeks,
3 Spaniards, 44 Chinese, 9 Malays, 4 quad-
roons and 2 half-castes. Sixty-nine inhabi-
tants passed out during 1922—a1l males, and
11 died of old-age!
“Galleryman,” from his perch:—
One feature of the Vic. political situation is the
growing unpopularity of McPherson. Oppositionists
are increasingly hostile, and, rather to his amaze-
ment, he is being sniped by “independent” or dis-
gruntled Government supporters. Of course, a man
with a somewhat self-conscious air of being a public
benefactor is bound to incur enmity, but McPherson’s
worst offence is that he has produced half-a-dozen
surpluses. A Treasurer can’t do that in Australia
and retain the esteem of his brother-politicians.
There are signs that Lawson is not now so infatuated
with the idea of basing his programmes on the finan-
cial policy of his colleague. Much rubbish has been
written about the Premier’s “loyalty” to colleagues,
but when he had to choose between his “loyalty” and
his billet he dropped all the men who had been sub-
jected to press criticism, though he had announced
that he would stand by them to the last cfitch. So,
if the unpopularity of McPherson threatens the Gov-
ernment’s existence, Mac will have to go. Perhaps
he will have a decorative exit into some more illu-
minated sphere.
Nobody can accuse the N.S.W. Auditor-
General of habitually violent language, but
now and then he indulges in what might be
called a reproachful attitude. This is from
his last report: —
In considering the interest. bill it must be re-
membered that certain works on which loan moneys
have been spent do not return anything like the
interest paid upon the loans. ,
Certainly! The railways are supposed to be
permanent and reproductive, even though
some other investments may be dubious. And
last year over 26 million pounds’ worth of
Ma State’s railways were only £4 los. lUd.
p.c. short of earning their keep—the interest
paid on loan money was £5 4s. 4d. p.c. and
the interest earned 10s. 6d. And the oldest
line has only been doing that sort of thing for
59 years.
Lately two Government grazing blocks of
19,000 acres each were gambled for in the
Cloncurry (Q.) district, and 616 people took
a ticket in the sweep. And it wasn’t a
record by a long way. This sort of thing is
supposed to represent an acute demand tor
land (just as the rush for tickets in Tatt.’s
represents an acute demand for horses), a
fierce desire to “settle,” and the need for
breaking up big estates. To some extent it
does. The rest is just a craving for easy
money. The successful applicant for 20,000
acres' or so pays about £lOO, and doesn t
necessarily begin to reside for six months.
There are generally people who are anxious
to give something handsome for the half-
year’s agistment rights; and by the end of
that time it is always possible to arrange
something else. The winner of the sweep
may then settle; if he is a shopkeeper, or a
bank clerk, or a sailor, or a bed-ridden female,
he probably doesn’t.
The most plausible suggestion up to date
for getting a new variety of M.P. is to re-
quire that every candidate shall qualify by
the possession of a diploma showing that he
has passed a fairly stiff examination in poli-
tical economy, history, the rudiments of law
and a few other subjects. The world nas
been accustomed to religious, residential,
financial and age qualifications for law-
makers, and ability to read and write has
been insisted on, but anything like a solid
brain qualification would be new. It would
lead to this country being advertised over
the globe, and might even help the deveiop-
ment of our wonderful natural resources.
One can never tell where these wonderful
natural resources will break out next.

Repulsed in Britain, the Communists have
applied for admission to the S. African Laboi
party, with the now-familiar result. In
announcing it the S.A.L.P. said that it relic
on evolutionary, not revolutionary, methods,
that it believed in representative institutions
as against a foreign Internationale with
whiskers on it, and that, having seen a R
revolt in progress on the Rand, it would
rather have democracy with order than dic-
tatorship of the proletariat with violence.

From a former union secretary :
At the feast of unreason and flow of bosh on .Eight-
hour Day it was remarked that Sydney Trades Hal
had cost £BO,OOO, of which £17,000 is still unpait .
This was quoted as “an instance of the apathy of the
present-day unionist.” But the apathy isn t a ne.\
development if the Trades Hall debt has any bear-
ing upon the matter. In years now remote, a site in
Dixon-street was granted for a Trades Hall by /*
Government that was after the Labor vote. To this
E. W. O’Sullivan added some more earth with a
Goulburn-street frontage. Then came the eight-hour
art union, the profits of which were devoted to the
Trades Hall fund. At no time has the Sydney union-
ist distressed himself by laying direct gifts on the
altar of his Temple of Toil- But he used to e
really enthusiastic about his Eight-hour Day proces-
sion. In 1890, for instance, 2500 wharf-laborers,
3300 seamen, 500 painters (the entire membership),
500 Balmain laborers, 400 boilermakers, 40b stone-
masons, 500 stewards and cooks, and 800 coachmakei's
marched through Hie streets. There was nothing
like those numbers in Monday’s show, although
nearly all the unions have greatly increased their
membership.
The public grows weary of the
meeting of Mrs. Lang, of Sydney (with he*
old fish-basket), and Mrs. Fuller, of Sydney
(similarly laden), and their statements m
the press that both of them are no political
lady, and barely a female. Why don’t they
get a soap-box apiece, and address the gib-
bering multitude in Bathurst-street during
the lunch-hour, and be orthodox?
“Cartot”: It is easy to make out a plau-
sible case for the removal or lowering of the
present prohibitive duties on imported sera
and antitoxins. The argument most tre-
quently employed is that medical science
should have no obstacles of any kind placed
in its way. Nevertheless, the removal ot
the import tax would be little short of a
calamity. By its aid the Commonwealth
Serum Institute has been able to provide the
community with serological preparations
which have proved the equal of all and the
superior of many of the foreign-manufactured
therapeutic agents; and the Institute has
put many preparations within the reach ot
people for whom they were out of the ques-
tion before the duties were imposed.
“R. 8.,” from S’Africa
The wisdojn of Australia’s Alien Immigration
law is witnessed here in Durban. Natal imported
coolies for sugar plantations without any provision
for returning them. So they practically all remained,
and the result is that Durban lias a bigger popula
tion of Indians than white people, and well-to-do
Indians are buying property in the best parts of
the town. Fine dwellings in fashionable quarters
are occupied by Indian merchants, who are whirled
about in expensive motor-cars. In every town in
Natal the bulk of the business is done at coolie shops,
and white people buy there without shame. Alreadx
parts of Durban look like Bombay; and, as usual,
the financial glitter of some of the Hindus makes
too many white women careless about the color
line.
DEFENCELESS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The harvest ripens on the hills- for whom?
Oh, careless child of sunshine, do you know?
Forevision you the dice that Fate shall thiow,
Or guess the pattern of the unmade loom?
1 hear a mocking voice within the gloom,
Like thunderclap of bloodstorm in the brain:
“Lift up a louder voice and ask again,
And wait the answ'er at the doors of Doom!”
And so I w'ait and watch the paltry mass
Of puny politicians, spouting rot,
And people gorging at the lotus-tree.
The harvest ripens on the hills. Alas,
1 see the golden guerdon guarded not,
And. mark the staring eyes beyond the .sea.

7 p.c. on £50,000 of prefs.
In 1915 Perdriau’s commenced paying 124
p.c. divs. on £130,000 of ordinary capital.
Now, after a couple of difficult years, the
same rate is resumed on £548,487, and
7 p.c. is paid on £50,000 of prefs.
But this took all except an odd £8
of the profits disclosed by the direc-
tors, and meanwhile no visible addi-
tions had been made to reserves. It is im-
probable that the management lias distri-
buted practically every penny of the year’s
earnings; it can almost certainly be taken
for granted that something has been dropped
into inner reserves. An examination of the
published accounts does not, however, throw
any light on the matter; the behavior of the
cash position has been obscured by the rais-
ing of new capital, which went into works
extensions, and the amount of the deprecia-
tion allowances is not disclosed. That
everything is going well is emphasised by the
announcement, issued on the same day as
the directors’ report, of a proposal to capi-
talise £54,849 of reserves, giving one fully-
paid bonus ordinary for every 10. As there
is less than £20,000 of general reserves, in-
cluding the P. aud L. balance, most of the
bonus issue will be provided by the
machinery, plant, furniture, fittings and
vehicle reserve, thus confirming the "Wild
Cat’s” suspicion of previous years that the
amount held in that account was additional
to the actual requirements for wear and
tear and replacements. In the introductory
table the annual votes to that specific reserve
have always been treated as profit and the
total included with reserves. At June 30
there was £46,893 lying there, giving total
net reserves of £51,802 after deducting
£15,000 represented by goodwill. AVhen the
new shares have been issued, visible reserves
will be £3047 short of the book value of good-
will.
The following comparisons show how the
business has expanded since 1915 -
1915. 1920. 1922. 1923.

The pending bonus issue is the first in the
co.’s career; unlike other rubber-manufactur-
ing concerns there have been no reconstruc-
tions or other re-arrangements to swell capi-
tal account: directors'and shareholders have
been content to take a good average rate of
dividend and develop the business steadily on
sound lines. Shareholders’ faith is shown by
the increase of capital from £130,000 to
£598,487 in eight years by subscriptions to
new share issues at par. In every respect
the Perdriau co. looks very comfortable nowa-
days, and though visible reserves are not
large the directors have probably re-
inforced the weaker sections of the business
in the many prosperous years. The ease
with which the co. shook off its troubles dur-
ing the period of slump and depression was
evidence of how conservatively the manage-
ment had controlled affairs during the period
of rapid development.

Prior to reconstruction in 1920 goodwill had
a book value of £15,000; since then it has
been £25,000. In the table it is not
treated as an asset: reserves are shown less
the funds represented by goodwill. However,
that item is only a minor one in a balance-
sheet which now totals £567,676; the
most important factor is the earning
capacity of the co.’s own knitting works and
of the mills for manufacturing wool-tops,
yarns and worsteds in which it has invested
so much of its capital. The enterprise is
an old one: a score of years ago the A.K.M.,
a small proprietary, was manufacturing
knitted goods from imported yarns, and by
1910 had blossomed into a limited liability
co. so that new capital could be found for
extensions. The business developed steadily,
and when war conditions cut off supplies of
raw materials the directors took advantage
of the opportunity to extend the co.’s inter-
ests to yarn-spinning. The Yarra Falls
Spinning Co. was registered as a proprietary
in 1918, the knitting concern taking up
88,334 £1 fully-paid shares. This co. has
spent nearly a half-million on combing and
-spinning works, and the knitting co.’s hold-
ing at June 30 last was £222,950. The enter-
prise has made excellent progress : the first
yarn was produced towards the end of 1919,
and early this year about 25,0001 b. was
being manufactured per week, and output
should be increased in the next few months
when additional plant is installed. In this
way the enterprising directors solved the
problem of securing ample and regular sup-
plies of materials, and at the same time
helped the development of an industry which
is essentially Australian. The spinning co.
has given employment for a half-million of
capital and a labor team of 600 ; meanwhile,
the knitting co. has expanded its turnover
to more than 2000 dozen garments per week.
The following comparisons of balance-
sheet figures show how Australian Knit-
ting Mills, Ltd., has expanded since the
spinning enterprise was established :

The figures tell their owu story. The intro-
ductory table sets out in detail the triumphal
record of the business from shareholders’
point of view. The results are more glitter-
iug because large amounts of new capital
have been introduced each year and have not
helped profits for the full periods covered by
the accounts. And the co. is probably doing-
even better than the profits disclosed by the
directors would indicate. Besides the visible
reserves of £31,017 (£56,017 less £25,000
represented by goodwill), there is a depreci-
ation reserve account holding £16,834, which
may not be all required for replacements.
There may also be undivided profits in the
spinning co. which has so far passed on only
mild divs.: 1922, £9218 (5 p.c.); 1923,
£14,605.

The all-in profit for the year—that is, the
net profit from trading, plus the return from
investments and visible additions to various
reserves —was the smallest since.l9l3. The
net return from steamship' operations was
probably the leanest for a much longer
period. The coastal trade has been abnor-
mally dull, and that trouble was aggravated
by further wage increases and the strike on
the Maitland coalfield. The directors give
the net profits as £31,610, but in. the intro-
ductory table £3239 dropped into the insur-.
anc-e fund and £1278 net additions to other
specific reserves (depreciation, special re-
newals and replacements, etc.) have been
taken in. The Melbourne S. S. has, for the
time being, to be regarded as an investment
co. as well as a coastal trader, because there
is nearly £288,000 of funds in Government
securities, fixed deposits, mortgages and
shares in other cos. Assuming- these invest-
ments turned in an average of only 4 p.c.,
the shipping end of the business, in which
£483,000 or so of. funds has been invested,
produced only £24,600 last year. All the
profit visible after delving in every corner
of the latest balance-sheet represented a re-
turn of only slightly more than 4J p.c. on
shareholders’ total funds. Nevertheless, the
usual 10 p.c. was paid on ordinaries, the size
of reserves in relation to: capital making
that rate available. In war-time the co.
showed very fat earnings, and four steamers
were sold at the height of the boom in ship-
ping values at prices greatly in excess of
their written-down book values. Between
1915-19 £136,000 of reserves were converted
into scrip; but the accounts still show
£337,915 of accumulated profit helping to
earn divs. for £340,000 of ordinaries. Con-
sequently, net earnings of only 5J p.c. pro-
duce 6 p.c. for the £26,000 of cum. prefs.
and 10 p.c. for ordinaries. The co. is, there-
fore, well equipped to weather the unfavor-
able conditions which have been ruling in the
coastal trade.

In 64 years to June, 1921, the surplus of
readily realisable assets over and above all
outside liabilities moved ahead £375,433,
while the book value of fixed assets declined
only £78.218. Since then theCoolana (2197
tons), Ellaroo (7000 tons) and a powerful
tug, the Tooronga, have been added to the
fleet, fixed assets having expanded £168,431,
with a decline of £142,190 in the liquid
position. Even after making those addi-
tions to the fleet, all liabilities, the whole
of the pref. capital and £216,000 of the
£340,000 of ordinary capital were covered
by gilt-edged investments, stocks, book debts
and cash. That left £128,000 of capital re-
presented by a fleet with a book value of
£437,135, freeholds (at cost) £43,677, and
wharf-plant and odds and ends written down

The published accounts include with the
year’s surplus the £l2lO of premiums on
new shares, but as earnings from under-
writing and investments cover div. require-
ments, and a few pounds more than the
share-premiums are put into reserve, the pro-
cedure is of no consequence. The past two
years have been unfavorable for the co.; as
with most others, losses have been abnormally
heavy. The Federal Mutual cut costs a few
points last year, and' that permitted under-
writing to show a margin of £l7BO on the
right side. Interest from investments and
other income gave £3621, making the total
of £5351 shown in the table. The div. rate
was brought down three points to 7 p.c.,
but that took all except £192. Even 7 p.c.
would not have been earned had new shares
not been sold at a premium, because, the
volume of insurances having increased,
under ordinary conditions portion of the
year’s surplus would have been re-
quired for increasing- the reserve for unex-
pired risks. However, share premiums
covered practically all requirements under
that head. On the basis that 40 p.c. of a
year’s., net-premium income should be ad-
equate to re-insure all outstanding risks, at
June 30- the Federal Mutual needed £37,643.
Actual reserves were only: £l3B short of that
amount.
The latest accounts closed the Federal
Mutual’s 11th year, and, notwithstanding the
lowered values of many incurables, and the
strenuous competition for good risks, the
management has continued to expand the con-
nection. dross premiums amounted to
£175.195 last year, compared with £148,888
for 1922. Nine years’ underwriting is re-
corded in the next table : :

The one weakness of ; the Federal Mutual is
that funds have not kept pace with the larger
business, notwithstanding all the new capital
raised. Funds equal to 150 p.c. of the last
year’s premium income give reasonable back-
ing to policies; this co.’s capital and reserves
are only 118 p.c. of the past year’s net revenue
from insurances, the £111,209 of funds being
about £30,000 short of standard proportions.
However, there is £221,112 callable on the
shares subscribed, though uncalled capital
is not the surest backing. In view of the
fact that the placing of new shares at a
premium is not likely to be so easy now that
the div. rate is down to 7 p.c., the directors
should consider whether, in the interests of
prospective expansion of the business, a call
of a couple of shillings is not desirable. That
would make finances snug, and, provided risks
are carefully weighed, under normal condi-
tions reasonable divs. should be -earned, par-
ticularly as 5 p.c. and more could be got from
investment of the new funds in public securi-
ties.
In other respects the Federal Mutual is
comfortable. It was floated on sound lines;
there was no promotion consideration or ex-
cessive flotation cost, and divs. have been paid
regularly since the close of the fourth year.
Liabilities, apart from unexpired risks,
amounted to only £4384 at June 30. Assets
totted up £l2l ~130 —public securities and
(*ash, £48,713; mortgages and investments
(nature unspecified), £25,643; premises and
equipment. £24,001 ; and book debts. £23,173.

Ordinaries are on the div. list again. Beard,
Watson’s was reconstructed at the top of the
war-time boom, and when values slumped
only a handful of reserves was available to
effect the adjustment of values necessary to
take in stock at replacement cost. The direc-
tors consequently had to call on 1922’s earn-
ings. That writing-down, of course, helped
to make the better profits for the past 12
months; they were beaten only in 1920, and
had the directors then anticipated a collapse
of values they would probably have regarded
portions of that year’s profits as nominal
only, and not used them and all other accumu-
lations for a bonus-scrip issue. Owing to
the reconstruction, the improved profits give a
comparatively small return on capital; the
amount available for ordinaries when the two
lots of prefs. had had their bite was only a
trifle more than 94 jj.c., so there is not much
visible margin over and above the ordinaries’
8 p.c. Whether , the business will expand
to give profits larger than those for the past
year is a matter the market has to take into
consideration. Of course, the present rate
of div. is very sweet to old holders, whose
scrip was almost doubled. Besides, the
present market value of their shares offers
them an excellent return on their original
investment.

The co. was not always such a money-
spinner as it has been in recent years; after
paying 10 p.c. p.a. regularly, there was a
cold spell of three years, following the col-

premises were purchased by the directors at
a reasonable figure, and the high-class fur-
nishing business was developed in good style
during the flush war years. Paid capital

1914 had expanded to £117,066. The fol-
lowing comparisons show balance-sheet move-

df the Australian Provincial Assurance Asso-
ciation :
As && hartie is mentioned somewhat prominently
id a iiar. (B. 20/9/’ 23) relating- to this Association,
i dsfe to be allowed to draw attention to an inaccu-
racy Which, although apparently slight, is unfortu-
nately liable to do a certain amount of harrfi to my
staff and myself.
the paragraph reads:
the fire and marine branch, which John Goodwyn,
formerly Insurance Commissioner for Queensland,
established a few years ago to December 31 last
had registered a deficiency of £67,878.
hast year’s balance-sheet shows this amount as the
establishment account of the fire, marine and acci-
d'eht department. Of the amount some £20,000
represents commission bn personal-accident business
charged against the accident section in the years
1821 and 1922, but not actually paid away by the
Association; and a further £12,000 represents a
share of the Association’s general overhead charges
for the years 1921 and 1922, which a new depart-
ment could scarcely be expected to shoulder in the
early stages of its development.
I aril satisfied from our departmental figures that
ttife Association’s actual outlay on the transferred
fire; fiiarilie and accident department will not exceed
£40;00t) at the date of transfer, which figure in-
cludes dh estimate of £5OOO for • outstanding claims
and for Unexpired preniium reserve on tile
recognised 4C» p;C. basis, which is, however; Seldom
atteiiipted by new cos. In their early stages.
this latter item automatically disappears at the
date of transfer, leaving a net outlay of £20,000
to represent the cost of organising ten branches in
Australia ahd Maoriland and the production of an
inbbrfie bf over £iOO,OOO in gross premiums in less
than three years, a result, I will venture to say,
which any Controlling officer having any experience
of building up a fire, marine and accident business
froth scratch would pronoufice quite satisfactory.
In CbnclUsion, I wish to make it clear that this
letter is not written in any Controversial spirit; or
with ariy idea of questioning the decision of the
directors to revert to the original life and accident
programme of the Association. They were obviously
within their rights in coming to this decision, and
as a policy-holder and a shareholder I hope that their
decisibn will prove ultimately to be the right one.

Eal’le Herman, who figured prominently in
a series of Sydney floats some years ago, and
was afterwards called into court to explain
many strange happenings, is again in the
liifieiight. Herman was associated with
the recent Waldorf-Astoria (Hotel Mac-
quarie) flotation, which collapsed suddenly
when several of the provisional directors
decided to drop out. He is also on the
Board of Carter’s Hill gold-mine, Rockley
(N.S.W.), which lias lately been a storm
centre. On September 26 the directors by
majority vote decided to shift the registered
office of the co. into auditor J. T. Walton’s
stable. The dissenting directors are bucking
against the change and are calling a meeting
of shareholders.

The Sulphide Corp. is nibbling at the
B. H. Junction mine. The two properties
are a mile and a half apart, but railway con-
nections give a convenient unloading station
alongside the Central’s bins.. The Corp. s
Central mine will have a limited production
when operations recommence, but with Junc-
tion ore, though low-grade, it could keep its
mill going to capacity. The Sulphide s pre-
sent manager (James Hebbard) was an early
manager or the Junction. #
B H. Block 10 seems to have done better
than expected since Alex. Campbell exposed
its parlous state. Amalgamated Zincs debt
is expected to be wiped off the slate soon,
and there may be a little to dole out bo share-
holders at the end. # #
Yerranderie silver-lead field, in the moun-
tainous country 40 miles from Camden
(N.S.W.), has been brought into prominence
again by the profitable operations of the Sil-
ver Peaks mine. It has been a very productive
little field: between 1901-15 20,387 tons ore
yielded more than 2i million ounces silver,
4930 tons lead and 40050 z. gold, the total
fetching £242,371. Transport is the big
problem * the ore is carted to Camden on a
switchback road. Going from Camden it
rises 1600 ft., then falls 1300 ft., and ends
at the mines with another climb of liOOft.
Since 1922 motor-lorries have been com-
peting with horse-teams, but freight runs
into about 50s. per ton. One show recently
paid £3OO road-freight for a fortnight s de-
liveries. The ore goes to Port Pirie for
treatment. t t
Ivalgoorlie mine bosses and the sole sur-
viving firewood co., which has a monopoly,
are still haggling over the price of fuel. The
former pressed for a reduction of Is. per
cord, but when the Government reduced
water charges and brought “200.000 tons of
developed low-grade ore into the region ot
payability,” the firewood co. put up prices Is.
per cord. But it hinted that if the mine bosses
supported its application to the Government to
throw open certain heavily-timbered reserves
between Kalgoorlie and Norseman, and 1
the Government granted the concession tire-
wood in unlimited quantities would be made
available at the reduced price. The request
was not seriously considered by the mine-
managers, who are now said to be inquiring
whether Collie coal in pbwdered form could
not be used as fuel. It could, oi course;
but it is doubtful whether the Golden Mite
cos. are prepared tb fade the expenditure
necessary to remddel theif plants tor coai-
burnin-. 4 #
Attempts are being made, both locally and
in London, to provide capital to reshrrect
the Lancefield (W.A.). Hundreds of thou
sands of pounds were raised by Hoover,
Govett and others to work the mine. Really
a million’s worth oi gold was won, butsnaie-
holders gbt nothing; refractory ore, expen-
sive treatment methods and (at times) wait
ferent management ruined the original co.
and its reconstructed successors. A syndi-
cate of mine-managers then took a hand ana
did very well for a while, but ultimately tne
proposition beat them. The show has one
of the longest ore-shoots in the West, but
under present conditions the grade appears
td be below pay mark; # *
It turns out that the “ci'eep” in the Li°yd
George workings had been expected for soi -
tveeks. The broken natufe of the cotmtrj'
makes effective timbering a work of art in tne
L.G., because broken country won t hold.
A subsidence of 18in. is a serious affaiir when
the thousands of tons of overburden pressing
on the timbers are. taken into the calculation,
The creep occurred in the hiidway or eastern
open-cut, and the ptessure cut off the south
-workings ftoin trucking operations for a few
days, A general dislocation of policy fol-
lowed, the battery being reduced to two shuts,
and, sweetening ore from the south end en-
richment not being attainable) the poor stopeS
of the north end only remain to draw upon
until things are put ship-shape. In the south
winze the reef went Very flat to the east at
80ft., so the second level will be driven at
180 ft. instead of at 200 ft. # „

on the Carlton lease, adjoining the Lloyd

“C.A. J.”: Mention of the Redemption
mine, Cooigardie, recalls memories. lhe
show was discovered by a street-preacliei
named Mitchell. He was a tall,. gaunt man
whose voice was heard nightly m Bailej s-
street for a couple of years, and he was
accompanied by another young man of sum
lar proportions. They were known as the
“Southern Cross” or “The Heavenly Point-
ers ” Mitchell regarded his find as a gift ot
God, and lie placed his pious young friend
in a position second only to his own. Early
crushings were fair and consistent. 1 e
stories told by the miners were maay and
humorous ; notices were plastered th, l? ’ ' O J t

alcohol and all other sins, and th e Redemp-
tion became to be known as The Refoima

Of course, the shares have been good
gambling counters, and some of the wise ones
have no doubt made a bit that way. L. Han-
sen still runs the show, and is now cioss-
cuttin* west at No. 4, where he is on the
track of the Middle reef, which is badly
crushed out of shape. No. 5 level north is
in the same disturbed zone, and both McMil
lan’s and the Middle reef at No. 6 are poor
Nearly all the stone sent to the mill of late
has come from No. 8 level. The reef is big,
but its quality poor: 5651 tons gave only
14500 z. However, Hansen perseveres, and,
knowing how Daylesford values peter out at
depth, he is going mostly for extensions of
the Ajax and Middle reefs in the shallower
levels. He proposes to gamble at No. 9 by
prodding into the belt of slates which, in
other levels, carried all the payable quartz.
While Ajax North struggles, its neighbor,
the Ajax, is out with another bob div., much
to the joy of the ring which pooled scrip in
the early' days of the last boost.
With the shallow ground giving fairly good
returns, Cock’s Pioneer, Eldorado .(Vie.),
has not had to make the calls anticipated
earlier in the year. It has pulled through
well, the latest accounts showing debts ot
£17,714 off-set by £24,769 of liquid assets.
The present paddock will be worked out next
month; then money will flow out to re-
assemble the plant on the new barge and
get on to the gold-bearing drift. From the
last two runs 404,700 c. yd. drift gave
35340 z. gold and 481 tons tin oxide. The
average was 8.38 d. gold afld 3.83 d. tin a yd.,
or about lid. poorer than the previous block
treated. With water short, the co. was lucky
to get through with a tiny Working profit
of £229. After providing for depreciation
P. and L. was £233 on the wrong side,
Profits from the balance of the paddock
should s»oon put that right; although the old
miner scooped the 50ft. and 70ft. floors pretty
Well bare, he left a strip of wash which, With
good stuff coming from 90ft., should furbish
profits. A lot of boring has been done down
the gutter, and although costs there will be
heavier, (Collins House looks forward to Jack
Wharton’s promise that good returns should
b e won from the deep runs of wash as soon
as the plant can get at them.
Vic.’s Secretary for Mines lias broken a
bettle over the new State battery at Mary-
borough. The plant should not have been
a charge on the State, but in recent years
all the alluvial patches in the Cabbage Gar den
have had to be spoon-fed. Out of the Duke
and Majorca leads millions have come, but
the district hasn’t a shaft 1000 ft. deep on
one of its many reefs. Nor has it the pluck
to do serious alluvial work on the Homebush
gutter, which gave £400,000 of gold, but
nowadays has not a single pump rattling.
Operations on the Normahby field (N.Q.)
have taken a turn for the better. The Billy
Hughes’s new shows, the Bruce and Resur-
gam, have been giving some ounce stuff, and
this month the battery should handle about
100 tons. Some ore raised from the Grant
mine is also to be carted to the battery
for treatment. The co. continues to prospect
new finds; a shaft is down 7ft. on the Spider
reef, between the Bruce and Resurgam shows,
and some 4oz. stuff has been sighted. Mean-
while, better ore has shown up at 80ft. in
the Marquis, which is expected to give some
battery-feed at an early date. Other finds
near the battery are also being tested, and,
with the help of Government grants,. the Billy
Hughes still has hopes of unearthing some-
thing which will reward it for its energetic
prospecting and its earlier disappointments.
The Canary, Kangaroo Hills (N.Q.), chirps
that “everything is satisfactory.” The main-
shaft is down 20ft. below the bottom, level,
and is in a “good quartzite formation.” .The
sinking of this shaft has drained the winze-
workings, thus permitting a resumption of
.ore-raising there. The south drive at 126 ft.
is now in 37ft., with a foot of formation
showing in the end. The latest crushing of
51 tons-odd yielded If tons black tin, wortn
approximately £220.

Walter Colley has been seeking the most
suitable plant with which to equip the Rus-
sell and Johnstone River (N.Q.) dredging
propositions. His sampling gave high values,
and if average recoveries are anything like
his estimates the co. now in process of flota-
tion should be on a good thing. Assuming
only 75 n.c. of Colley’s values are recovered,
the Russell proposition would return 3s. gold
and 44d. tin per yd. There are approxi-
mately* 340 acres available for attention. The
Johnstone River claim runs into about 200
acres, most of it free from rocks and debris,
and Idwt. values should give good returns
from an efficient plant.

Bux, the Badak boom float,. continues its
interest in Korneo oil. is theie al
right, but the Dutchman takes good care
that only his own folk handle it. Bob Boyd,
Bux’s original prospector, got traces on the
l’etoerau River, but owing to floods he
brought only a minute sample back to Mel-
bourne. Dyne did not have the same luck,
and the gas he stirred up in the mud ot
the stream was the same old gas from rotting
vegetation which is pretty plentiful in the
Commonwealth. Dyne dismisses two of the
concessions south of the river Ketoengau, but
says that boring should be done on No. -
block, where there is a favorable anticlinal
structure. This area is on the river Petoe-
rau and Lvne thinks it would be as well to
cling to block No. 1 alongside as a position
area. He considers that a reservoir should
be got at 3000 ft. to 3500 ft. down on No. 2.
He would also like to give the Sai River
blocks, 21 miles -west of No. 2 concession, a
trial • he likes the nrospects of striking oil
at. about 1200 ft. So his visit gives two
spotting chances. The rest will depend upon
the Dutchman, whose law permits the
foreigner to locate oil, but only provides for
compensation by the East Indies Government
for the ground. This is poor comfort. Lyne tells
Bux not to spend a guilder till the co. has a
definite pledge that it will be allowed a direct
interest in any strike. If a promise is ex-
tracted the next thing will be to float a
£lOO,OOO co. Both the Standard Oil and the
Anglo-Persian have tried to secure interests
in Borneo oil areas, but the Butch Shell
crowd have beaten both John Bull and
Brother Jonathan badly when titles came to
be discussed. It will be odd if Bux should
win where the big fellows have failed.
About 40 oil “concessions,” covering prac-
tically the whole of Westralia, have been
granted, but only on two, Freney and Okes.
has any boring been done. A few others have
been inspected by “scientific expeditions,
and glowing reports have been issued from
time to time about prospects. But beyond
that they have done nothing except to apply
for exemption and further exemption. Lessees
everywhere except in the Freney and Okes
areas are shepherding their holdings in the
hope that oil will he struck by one or both
of those ventures.
Australian Oil Corp. is preparing for its
campaign to prospect by drilling its IQ.OOO
acres around Dunn’s bore, Beaudesert (Q.).
The A.0.C., which has issued 100,000 con-
trib. shares, is no-liability, but is shortly to
be reconstituted as a limited liability co.
Mersey Valley Oil, the Speck proposition
in which Russian oil-geologist De llautpick
stakes his reputation, and of which ex-Prime
Minister W. M. Hughes is a director, pro-
poses to instal three further deep-boring
plants. The public has subscribed more
than 34,000 shares, and efforts are being
made to place others, at par, to give funds
for “thorough development.”
Adelaide Oil Exploration Co., which “cut
gas under enormous pressure in its eighth
bore-hole in Tasmania —g sure indication
that drilling is being carried out by it on
an oilfield of great extent”—is also seeking
additional capital.

ploit than we expected him to be. Ihe
reason came out when he was questioned by

hard to look interested at first, but presently
I happened on a page where I had to, try
harder'not to look embarrassed. The picture
was clearly that of a lady who would soon
have a claim for £5 against the Common-
wealth, but the incongruity of it was that
she was in all the bravery of wedding finery,
veil and orange blossoms and all. “Auntie
Polly,” said one of the daughters com-
placently. Then she became explanatory.
“Auntie never got a chance to be taken until
a month before little Dave was born, and
then a photographer came along. It gave her
a chance to get snapped in her wedding

agreed that she was very lucky.

do with their charge. Ascertaining that Jus-

tion.. The captain, when she apparently
made her last plunge into the void the other
day, was making his first trip on her bridge.
Previously three other seamen had lost their
lives on the vessel. Incidentally, she was
the second of her name, the first having been
torpedoed by the Germans off the coast of
Spain in 1917. During the war tinfish
entered the vitals of 12 other ships of the
Hogarth line, to which the Baron Blantyre
belonged. The casualties amounted to 50
per cent, of the strength.
“Iford”: The scant honor a prophet too
often gets in his own country has a curious
illustration in the recent small-pox outbreak
at Gloucester (Eng.). The irony of it lies
in the fact that there is no 18th-century cele-
brity of whom Gloucestershire professes to
be prouder than Dr. Edward Jenner, the dis-
coverer of vaccination. Jenner’s home town
was Berkeley, less
than 20 miles from
the county capital,
and here, at the
beginning of the
present year, the
centenary of his
death was cele-
brated with the
usual talk about his
priceless services to
humanity. A few
months later Glou-
cester came into
the limelight with
the worst small-pox
epidemic recorded
in the ILK. for
very many years,
and official investi-
gat i o n disclosed
that nowhere in
the country have the
vaccination laws
been more con-
tem p-t uously
ignored. Yet these
laws are so mild to-
day that nobody
need have his child
vaccinated if he
makes a declaration
within four months
of the date of
birth that he con-
scientiously believes
it will be prejudi-
cial to the child’s
health. It almost
looks as if popular
prejudice against,
or utter indiffer-
ence about, vacci-
nation is stronger,
after a hundred
years, where there
arc statues to its discoverer than in any
other part,of the British Empire.
“Sol Mala prop” considers the Ku-Klux: —
The story used to go that the term was simply
an imitation of the noise mado by the cocking of
the old muzzle-loading gun, that sound being often
the first news that the prospective corpse got of the
Klan’s arrival. Later pedants quote the Greek
lcuklos (a circle), though the Australian kooka-
burra (an ass in a tree) looks about as appropriate.
A great deal has been written and spoken lately in
Australia about the merits of this U.S. institution,
and about its aims and principles. The probability
is that the principles are just as lofty as can be
expected of any organisation which goes snooping
round at night with guns and masks and aliases.
As to its aims, it seems sirnnly to aim at the victim,
and leave him or his executors to guess why. It
may be out to prohibit something or to abolish
something, or it may be that different bands of
reformers go out and prohibit different things in
different places on the spur of the moment, or it
may be that the whole business is only homicidal
mania and a sort of blood-drinker’s dream, and a
running amok. Sinn Fein also went round a good
GETTING DOWN TO CASES.
“Blobs is in hospital.”
“A case of nerves?”
“ No—many cases of whisky.”
deal at night, but everybody was told quite clearly
what Sinn Fein wanted. Ku-Klux is so non-explan-
atory that some people fancy it is taking a long
shat at the Pope; some think it is, in part at least,
a revival of the original Ku-Klux, which was Southern
secessionist and anti-nigger, and the nigger is mostly
a Methodist; and a few unwise bigots hail it as a
social-purity move and an uplift. A very strong
possibility is that the rank and file know very little,
but that, if the leaders can secure power by
terrorising the forces of the law, their intentions
will then be explained by instalments, and will
prove remarkably like those of Lenin and co. in
their younger days, before they began to be dis-
illusioned. Seventy years ago the “Know-Nothing”
party captured a fair number of seats at a U.S.
Congressional election. It got its name because
every member, if asked by a non-member what
the party aimed it, said everybody would find out
when the new crowd got. into office. As it never
got in, its motives remain unexplained to this day,
yet it was quite a big institution for a while. If
the Know-Nothing or Blank Cheque crowd had
taken to midnight : outrage it might have been an
early Ku-Klux.
“Jesmond”: The most casual Digger I
ever met was using his own razor on the
shattered remnant of his own leg. I waited
til! he had fished out about of hone from
below the hip before rating him for his
foolishness. "Aw,” he replied, “I boiled me
razor, and, any rate, I reckon I know more
about me own leg than all your ruddy doc-
tors.” Possibly he did, for the operation
he had just completed usually meant a month
or so in hospital, whereas he lost only a
couple of days over it.
-X- * * *•
“Pink Tape”: Everything was in train
for a Sydney suburban wedding when an
uninvited guest intruded liis frame into a
party held the night before the event. He
pushed his way through the crowd, and
offered the bride-to-be his hand and heart.
It soon transpired that it was no Young
Lochinvar stunt; the articles proffered were
very much second-hand, and the profferer
was the husband the lady had divorced five
years before. Yet, when he proclaimed that
the woman he had since married was dead,
and he was" prepared to give her the old job
of cooking his meals and darning his socks,
the pull of the old love proved too much for
the intending bride. In subsequent proceed-
ings connected with disorderly conduct that
were ventilated in a police-court, it appeared
that it was not the jilted ’groom but his
brother who took umbrage at the arrange-
ments being upset. A curious magistrate
probed the ’groom’s feelings. “I thought I
might as well let things go,” he explained.
“It looked to me as if he had a prior claim.”
“Flicker”: In a Red Page review of a
couple of Munro’s Scottish stories (B.
2G/9/’23) mention is made of present-day
people who, unable to forget the Massacre
of Glencoe, Pstill swear srood round Gaelic
oaths” when the Campbell name is brought
up I’ve met some of them. In Egypt I be-
came cobbers with a Maorilander, a Macgregor,
whose opinion of the Campbells was wonder-
fully blasphemous. One day I rallied him
about it, and said that I thought he must
be about 'the only one left now who kept up
the old feud spirit so strongly. He laughed.
“I’ll introduce you to a mate of mine to-
night,” he said, “and then you’ll see if I’m
the only one.” We met the mate, and
“Here’s a friend of mine, Macdonald,” said
my pal. Macdonald started to put out his
hand. “Trooper Campbell.” The Mac
donald’s hand dropped to his side. “How
do you do?” he said stiffly, and walked away.
“Randolph Rentless”: For the usual
offence a Sydney Court dealt last week with
“a finely-dressed woman.... She landed in
Australia from England 12 months ago, and
had married, her husband being a man of
weak intellect. She had carried on a sham
business as a dressmaker under the style of
Babette and Co.” :
Bill Young, was a palpable target
For guns who were keen on their game.
He married 'a Pommess from Margate
Who had no immaculate fame.
She came here to live
And her hand promptly give
To one who would lend her his name.
While the immigrant stream keeps on flowing
Unchecked* such a chance is not rare.
Bill Green was the simple “and Co.” in
The business they started right there.
And the sign of their trade
Was the dresses s'he made
Which she wore with an empress’s air.
REMORSELESS.
THE PEACEMAKER: "Go home, Mr. Bliggit;
go home and make it up with her Give
her some flowers!”
MR. B. (full of determination): “Never!
Not until I can stick 'em on 'er coffin!”

Romance smiles gladly on our lives
Whilst love the heart stirs itchingly,
And so we make those ladies wives
Who treat us most bewitchingly.
We give them our domestic toil
To do; but, ah, how mockingly
The knowledge comes, our dreams to spoil,
That Susie’s sewing shockingly.
Or we may find the dearest girl,
Once infinitely cuddlesome,
Is certainly no household pearl—
That Maud 'is mighty muddlesome;
That Lizzie loves' a lazy life
And leaves the house a rookery;
Or it is better have no wife
Than Carrie’s careless cookery. <
Ah. these are facts we do not face
In passion’s sweet felicity,
When love alone seems ample grace
For future domesticity.
In spite of all romantic fuss,
Love’s mockery smites chillingly
Upon the souls of all of us
When wives will not work willingly.

“T.P.”: Acting-Director of Education
Alfred 'Fussell ( Vic.) has made the pace a
welter during the temporary absence of his
chief Frank Tate, in the Cold Country. His
latest idea is to make the cheaper postage
a means of advertising Australia in the U.iv.
through the nippers. He has chopped the
State into 20 sections, and each is to pour
picture-cards and letters into the lap of a
named Director of Education in England,
who has promised to distribute the missives,
thus avoiding double-banking. Each of
100,000 cards will deal with Australian land-
scape or some branch of our industrial
activity. The originator of the scheme points
out to teachers and children that “in many
parts of England true Australian conditions
are unknown,” and he has hit on a promis-
ing plan for dispersing a little of the dark-
ness.
MAKING SURE.
"If I propose to you, will you say Yes?"

“F.A.”: “Deco’s” par. re the efficiency of
the Glasgow tramway system. (B. 10/9/ 2d)
reminds me that a little while back an en-
thusiastic Sydney tramway official wrote to
a contemporary at Chicago asking how the
tramways in the porky city managed to cope
with the morning and evening rushes of pas-
sengers. The reply came in the shape of a
photograph of a. “trolly” car whose exterior
was entirely obscured by the human mass
which hung about it from pole to footboard.
Beneath the picture were the two words:
“Like this.” #
"Splinter” : I don’t know whether any dis-
abled Digger ever got a pension without
applying for it (B. 20/9/’23), but I am
personally acquainted with one who was re-
ceiving a pension, and whose conscience _be-
r~m to prick him because he had no physical
defects to warrant it. Accordingly he re-
quested the local quack to certify that he
was iu robust health, so that the allowance
might be discontinued. The certificate was
EH?
THE SWEET YOUNG TRING: “Really a splendid photo of Geenge-I think it's really
clever of them to he able to do it!
sent along to the proper authorities; the
answer arrived a few weeks later m t e
shape of an intimation that the pension had
been doubled, and that the recipient should
be careful to collect arrears. The only ex-
planation I can offer is that the Department,
concluding the Digger was mentally un-
balanced, considered he was entitled to a
bit more.
“Old Blue” : Touching bayonet wounds and
the like. During the 10 months’ waiting be-
tween the first and second attack on Gaza
night raids on the Turkish trenches were fre-
quent. Doctors and surgeons in the casualty-
clearing stations were surprised and puzzled
bv the fearful wounds that Turkish prisoners
carried after these stunts. Inquiries made
later on showed that the Scotties, supplied
with brush-hooks to .clear a way through the
tangled masses of prickly-pear fences, had
hopped in with our raiding parties.
Social note from the Gulf Country
A mail contractor married a local maiden the
other day. The Police Magistrate tied the knot »n
the presence of the local police force and the rest
of the population. When the pair were fairly
hitched, the best man rushed for the first kiss. He
got it; but he also got a straight left to the nose
and a right chop to the jaw from the ’groom. It
was only with great difficulty, that he wgs coaxed
back to sign the register. The party then moved
towards the car, and one of the fair sex threw a
handful of rice on the bride and another on the
’groom; whereupon she was landed an open-hander. ,
The rest of the onlookers closed their rice bags.
The party drove off in the car, dropped the bride’s
father and the best man at the pub,- the brides-,
maid at the wedding breakfast, and the newly-
married couple at their future home. After the
guests had waited an hour and a half for the happy
couple to come to the feast, it was decided to send
the car for them. The driver and the bride con-
vinced the ’groom that the breakfast was in their
honor, so he put on his best suit again and came
along.

‘“O. McKay M.”: “Sturt” notes (B.
13/9/’23) that Judge Poole’s direction to a
S.A. jury that a verdict of “Guilty, but with
no felonious intent” cannot be accepted in a
bigamy case was confirmed on appeal. Gen-
erally speaking, the Law requires proof of
evil 'intention as well as wrongdoing; but
this is not always so in bigamy. English
Judges have laid it down (although the
U.S.A. law is different) that in actions of
this character the accused’s honest belief,
formed upon reasonable grounds, that his
first wife was dead, is, if borne out by. the
evidence, a sufficient rebuttal of the charge
of felony. Nevertheless —and this was
the point" in the case under review—similar
belief that the first marriage was dissolved,
by divorce or was invalid from the outset
affords no answer to an indictment tor
bigamy. In the Adams case, ui an action
somewhat akin to that to which Sturt re-
fers, a Vic. Court went so far as to hold
that evidence which aimed at showing that
the accused person had bona fide believed er
first marriage null was inadmissible. *
‘‘Coot” : For the Plucky Youngster Stakes
let me enter Alfred Eric James Clohesy, aged
14 of North Melbourne. He was employed
a*-’ a brick and tile works feeding a pug
wheel.” Starting the machinery one morn-
ing his right leg was caught between two
cog wheels, and smashed into a pulp. lion t

gone into the country for a few days. Three
hours later he was dead. <
“Schnorrer”: Cables in the dailies last
week referred to financial help rendered by
the Australian Jewish communities to the
starving Jews of the Ukraine. The story ot
the Ukraine during the last four years is teat,
of a catastrophe which dwarfs wars and
earthquakes; and in the case of the Jews
the terrors of
rac i a 1 massacre
have been added to
the slaughter by
famine and pesti-
lence. It has been
computed that
there are at least
a million and a
half children who
have lost their
parents, and hun-
dreds 6f thousands
of frantic parents
who don’t know
where to find their
children. , A har-
vest has now been
reaped, but the
struggle to exist on
cereals alone is
bringing fresh dis-
ease. Relief
societies, chiefly
American, have
done what they
could for the
stricken country,
but it is little
enough. People’s
eyes are drawn to
more spectacular
horrors; but
when the full story is told it will be realised
that the overwhelming of the people ot the
Ukraine is the most awful chapter in all
modern history. #
“Dormant”: A generous section of his
shirt protruded over a snake-skin belt, his
watcliguard, was made of quandongs and
traybits, and his ziff appeared to be a likely
place for sparrows’ eggs. After walking twice
round the outside of the Melbourne Show-
grounds, he appealed to me with a request
to be directed to tli e entrance. I pointed
out. the turnstiles. “Gripes,” he said, Ive
been looking for slip-panels; I thought them
blokes was spielers playing some new game.

“Oxmead”: It is the practice of some
Judges to affect or even vaunt ignorance of
tilings that can’t be gleaned from law books.
In Perth the other day it was being argue
before the High Court that a Jap was en-
titled to be placed on the electoral rolls be-
cause the present-day Japanese aie not
“aboriginal natives” of the country they in-
habit. The same point has been raised
(quite unsuccessfully) on behalf of Japanese
ciaiming civic rights in the L.S.A.; ana
there must be plenty of Australian school-
boys who have heard that Japan is supposed
t / have been originally occupied by a whis-
kered brand of primitive man who was
driven away into remote parts when the an-
cestors of the samurai and the geisha arrived,
just as the ancient Britons were hunted
into Cornwall and Wales by Jutes and
Danes and Angles. Federal Chief Justice
Adrian Knox, however, having never had
his attention officially directed to the hairy
Ainos, regards them as gnomes or pixies.
“The ordinary man in the street, ho
assured counsel at Perth, “never heard ol
the Ainos, or, if he did, he is different from
me, for I never heard of them until they
were mentioned here.”

“Flicker”: A new danger is threatening
the pronunciation of young Australia since
Premier Barwell imported a large ml “ber
of teachers from the Cold Countij. The
new arrivals hail from various places between
Zummerzet and Geordieland, with an occa-
sional Cockney for good measure, and in
some schools the influence of the dialect is
quite perceptible. Young Billjim and Bill-
jemima, too —at first imitate “the Pommy
just for fun. but it soon becomes a habit.
One small kid lost marks in a dictation test
recently because she wrote “coomin’ ” in-
stead of “coming.” And last week I saw a
crowd of youngsters listening eagerly to
young Jim Hardcase giving a recital of their
teacher drilling a squad. “ ’Awit!’ howled
Jim. “Stahnd still, laads !” “Cawn tye keen
quoiet?” and so on. Of course we must have

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
rocks to reappear on lower levels,.
When Pharaoh ruled Egyptian sand ?
And thousands at his lifted hand
Arabs and Nubians and Yids
Toiled hard to build the Pyramids,
Some water mixed with silicates
Was trickling down our eastern States,
And when it came to porous ground
just filtered through without a sound.
It left a shining opal there
Where green lands turned to red despair;
And sealed the summer’s bright desire
Within a heart of stormy tire.
Through all the ages nothing hid
The huge blunt-pointed pyramid,
Beneath it went the slave and king
And gaped to see the foolish Thing
That stood through every shining season,
Built up without a rhyme or reason,
A nioraiment that failed to keep
Its master-prisoner safe in sleep—
Vain as the desert sand-drifts blown
About its base of wasted stone.
And here the little opal shines.
It holds the skies, the green of vines,
The yellow autumn sunset glow,
Bright peacock lustres, glint of snow
And sudden fires like those that shone
On walls in falling Ilion.
Red in a flaming orange zone,
It seems like passion turned to stone.
The heavy, stupid pyramid
May prop up Egypt’s azure lid
As long as life and time shall last
To sneer at all its idiot past;
But this small, tender, fiery gem
Set in Australia’s diadem
In some remote and rainy spring
And under desert sandstone hid
Is larger than the pyramid.

F. M. B. (“Dahn”) Fisher, one-time Min-
ister for Customs in M.L., and son of George,
a quaint old political figure of other days
in the Rickety Isles, has landed the job of
Agent-General for British Guiana at a
salary of £2OOO p.a. He made his home in
the Cold Country some years ago, and since
then has been heard of at this end mostly
from the tennis-court. A few months back
he toured the West Indies in the interests
of the 1924 Empire Exhibition in London.
Fisher is a good lecturer and a fluent
speaker, with a tendency towards incisive
epigram which in his political days brought
him audiences but lost him votes.
“Uramao” : W. C.- MacGregor, Maoriland’s
new Judge, is the fifth that Presbyterian
Dunedin has given the Bench. He is the
son of that Scotch Dr. MacGregor who shep-
herded souls in Oamaru a quarter of a cen-
tury or so ago—about the time David McKee
Wright was pontiff at the Congregational
Church in the same street. Gladstone, when
in need of advice on prospective legislation,
sometinies sent for hard-headed professors
o? Edinburgh ’Varsity to come to London
for a talk, and it fell to Dr. MacGregor
several times to go down and discuss things
with the G.O.M.
J. F. Duff us, formerly Liberal member for
Port Fairy in Vic. Assembly, died at Cam-
berwell last week. His claim to fame was
that, as a Koroit publican, he beat Bryan
O’Loghlen at the general election in 1894,
when the country rose in indignation and
withered the J. B. Patterson following.
After that he was in and out till Labor
wrested the seat from him 15 years ago;
and that was the last the House saw of
him.
Richardson, of Geelong, the latest to take
the archaic job of unofficial leader of Vic.
Uppah Chambah, is a long wav behind such
predecessors as Sargood, Cuthbert, Wynne,
Davies, Manifold and Baillieu. He has a
lean and self-denialish look, lacks vision, and
his tendencies are w’owsery; but he is the
best available in a House that is crumbling.
Richardson is holding on to his £250 a year
as vice-chairman of the Railway Committee
to; supplement his member’s screw of £2OO.
As a sop to Pennington, Lawson’s ex-
honorary Minister

Harry Levien, formerly “Father of the

in the Six-and-eightpence profession last
week. He had his first and perhaps biggest
legal job when he was solicitor for the de-
fence of Sleath, Ferguson and the other Broken
Hill strike “conspirators” 30-odd years ago.

Want was for the defence, and Coffey, after-
wards District Court Judge, prosecuted. Both
died long since.
King O’Malley, though politics know him
no more, remains an energetic citizen who
does not confine his operations to one State.
His object in life these days is to provide
people with homes at moderate rents, with
himself as the landlord; and he has made
considerable progress. His latest scheme,
worked in conjunction with the American
architect Griffin, who came this way to lay
out the Federal capital, is in connection with
a “garden suburb” on the shores of Middle
Harbor (Sydney) ; and they had the luck to
find an ideal site for their experiment.
“Nogrum”; On the Balonne River 60
years ago, where the town of St. George
(Q.) now stands, four brothers named
Roberts—M'atthew, Mark, Luke and John
—drove in their pegs. To-day there are 86
Robertses in the township, and Lord only
knows how many other direct descendants.
The Robertses are known to the storekeepers
by the Christian name of the head of this
or that branch; for instance, the children
of Jack Roberts are called “Bill Jack” or
“Elsie Jack,” and of Bob Roberts “Harry
Bob” or “Mary Bob” and so on. So a new
set of hyphenated or bird-perch names is
well on its way.
The recent, death of Dr. Jeffrey Bird, of
Northcote (Vic.), snaps a link with the days
before Melbourne had a Medical School of
its own and had to import its practitioners.
Bird looked after Northcote’s aches for more
than 40 years and had one of the largest sub-
urban practices in the State. Despite his
age, few of the younger generation of saw-
bones kept more closely in touch with
advances in medical science.
Dead in Adelaide, at 85, C. A. Sobels, one
of the old German stock which came to Aus-
tralia about 1847. and had such a big hand
in building up the southern State. His
whole life, from his arrival at the age of
8, was given to the family profession of
wine-making. He lived for 50 years in the
country town of Watervale, where his firm,
During and Sobels, worked up the famous
Springvale vineyard and cellars.
“Xox” flicks a whip:—
J. H. Prowse, M.H.R., whip of the Federal Country
party, who is chairmaning the Navigation Act Com-
mission, is a partner with his brother in a big
Westralian wheat-farm, and holds divers other in-
vestments. Prowse was an insurance manager in
Perth, where he was mayor once or twice, but his
knowledge of farming has mortgaged his mind to
the exclusion of many former interests. Once he
was a rifle-shot and a cricketer, but Methodism is
now his only relaxation, apart from an occasional
game of bowls or tennis. Withal he is a pleasant
man and susceptible to a genuine hard-luck story.
But as a rank Freetrader he gets himself into the
most illogical tangles, and when taunted with mak-*
ing a remark at variance with some previous argu-
ment, it is one of the joys of Parliament to watch
him frenziedly turning up Hansard to see what he
really did say.
It is claimed for Mrs. Edward Hill, who
was born at Blacktown (N.S.W.) 102 years
ago, that she is the oldest native-born in-
habitant of Australia. Before she came for-
ward Mrs. Sarah Lumley, of Harris Park,
who is a mere 90, had the limelight upon her.
Mrs. Hill belongs to a branch of the wide-
spread Pye family.
“Bill Bowyang’s” story of a hard-doer:—
Tom Greers, who passed out recently in Dutch
New Guinea, was one of the early adventurers of
the Torres Strait pearling grounds. He sold his
luggers in ’B9 and went prospecting in Papua, but,
failing to find gold, bought a small schooner and
sailed around to Hollandia. Here he joined De
Jongh, a Dutch orchid hunter, and after many thrill-
some adventures they were attacked by wild bush-
men towards the end of 1890, near the Charles
Louis Mountains. De Jongh and their natives were
killed and devoured, but Greers, whose handsome
yellow beard was a novelty to the savages, was
taken to a village 30 miles inland. Here his
right leg was removed at the knee with a hoop-
iron knife, with the idea of preventing his escape.
Three weeks later, Greers, using a forked stick as
a crutch, got away into the scrub and eventually
met a party of Javanese bird-of-paradise hunters
near the coast. In his later years, Greers scoured
the interior of Dutch New Guinea for orchids for
a Yankee collector, and also did a good deal of
prospecting. He was a Cornishman and ended at 84.
A Melbourne motor-lorry a few days ago
put a sudden end to the existence of Samuel
Lazarus, whose chief claim to fame was that
Jie had been the foreman of the jury which
convicted Ned Kelly in 1880.
A regular patriotic contributor to the well-
being of Australia is the wife of schoolmaster
T. R. Mason, of Mendooran (N.S.W.). Mar-
ried 26 years, the couple have had 23 child-
ren. The eldest is 25, and 17 others are
living.
A recount of the preferential votes for the
Speck constituency of Bass (Senator J. B.
Hayes’s old seat) has put in George Shields,
brother of the runner-up in the Senatorial
by-election. The new member is having his
second term as Mayor of Launceston, and
assisted at the funeral of the “city man-
agership” there.
Brinsley Edward Lane, of Mayfair sta-
tion, near Winton (Q.), who died the other
day at 71, was one of the pioneers of N.-W.
Queensland. He was born at Orqnge

The humorist of the Vic. Leg. Assembly is E. C.
VVarde, the plump and affable Labor member for Flem-
ington. Warde has a bright but merciful wit; but,
though he stands out boldly in the conversational flat-
ness of his surroundings, he is really not in the
class with John Gavan Duffy or the late J. L. Dow.
Major ALEX. RUSSELL, who has gone
away with Prime Minister Bruce as un-
official private secretary.
Nor ia he as apt as E. L. Zox, the little man with
the blameless waistcoat. Zox was ever conscious of
the phonetic relationship of Zox to Vox, and one of
his earliest mottoes was “Zox populi, Zox Dei.”
One day when he was having an early bath at the old
Spring-street residence of the State Parliament, a
fellow-member, also in pursuit of a wash, heard the
splashes and said “Who’s that?” Immediately a pink,
white-whiskered face, followed by a glowing torso,
peered out of the door and solemnly answered
“Zox et prwterea nihil.”
Australia got back a Rhodes scholar with
the batch of immigrants who came on the
Ormuz. This was F. B. Richardson, the
Tasmanian, who acted as welfare officer on
the ship. He was an “outside” student;
and, having spent his time at Oxford on
chemical research, goes back to his job with
the Electrolytic Zinc Co.
“T.O.JL.”: Thomas Shine, who has died in
Sydney at 78, was the only policeman I ever
heard of who turned publisher. But first,
tiring of his slow promotion in the bush, he
tried tin-mining. His publishing business
was mainly in portrait reproduction—many
of them steel engravings by H. S. Sadd, of
Abbotsford (Vic.). A notable lot included
the N.S.W. Chief Justices down to James
Martin’s time and a group of the R.C.
bishops of the ’eighties.
S.A. Governor Bridges’s yarn of the Aus-
tralians in S’Africa told to the Veterans’
Association in Adelaide
They were beautiful horsemen, those bushmen, and
always beautifully mounted. I. think they were the
finest lot of fellows I have ever met. I have a
very clear recollection of a sergeant named Warby;
I believe he had been a horse-dealer \in Australia,
when they got into Johannesburg it was intense!'
cold, and no firewood was to be had. But Warbv
was a man of resource; he promptly removed tin
door from some magnate’s mansion, and made a
fire "jtli that. Naturally the owner remonstrated,
but Warby had the “grand manner,” and merely
replied: ’‘Apparently you don’t know who we are.
We are the Imperial Light Horse, and we general!''
light our fires with grand-pianos.”
“The Deacon”: Just-dead Donald Free-
man, who began life up Grafton way 82
years ago, when fences and selectors were
alike unknown, could recount many a tale
of brushes with natives. intent on spearing
the life out of the shepherds and the
sheep. One of his earliest recollections was
seeing an old shepherd on Bald Hill being
done to death with spears, and about the
same time a man named Meldrum and Mrs.
Mason, with her family, were wiped out.
Withal there was plenty of sport in those
days, and young Freeman was in great de-
mand for riding the squatters’ thoroughbreds.
Later on he made a bit of cash carrying to
the Vegetable Creek tin-mines, and finished
up as a farmer at Headman’s Creek. Inci-
dentally, he found time to marry a wife and
bring up 11 children.
“Imlay”: For many years Mr. Martin, a
patriarch of Towamba, on the N.S.W. South
Coast, has kept a coffin by him ; but though
he is now 104 he hasn’t had a chance to use
it yet. It has not been the same coffin all
the while, for several times when a wooden
overcoat has been wanted in the district he
has given his up. But he has always had
another made as soon as possible.
THE MINX.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now colored banks of sweetness
Breathe all about the town;
By buildings grim and hoary
Spring blossoms tell their story
Of happy days, their fleetness,
And how they take us down.
Fair Mays and Mabs and Jennies
With “fiances” or “blokes'’
Lift rapturous young noses,
So mignonette and roses
Set free the friendly pennies,
The shy half-crowns out-coax.
And now the sunbeams prancing
Enchant each sober street;
The tiddler at the corner
Forgets to be a mourner,
His. jig-notes set a-dancing
Rejuvenated feet.
’Tis Spring’s the time for wooing,
For recklessness and fun!
There’s life left in the oldest,
There’s pleasure for the coldest;
Come, let’s be up and doing—-
Come, let’s be up and done!
For Winter’s last grey ember
Has dwindled to eclipse;
Imperiously pretty
Sweeps down upon the city
Expensive Miss October,
“I must have!” on her lips.
Of all the months that bless us
Most feminine is she;
With smiles and saucy trifling,
One hand our pockets rifling,
She’ll flatter and caress us
And rob us shamelessly.
Oh, fathers, friends and lovers,
You cannot dodge your doom!
Pay out, it’s no use quaking;
Tn costly colors breaking,
From hosiers to glovers,
The drapers are in bloom:
With delicate devices
Shop windows lure and shock,
Where filmy garments glimmer
And jewelled slippers shimmer;
Though fiendish are the prices
How heavenly “the stock”!
October laughs: “Why, bless me,
Even Heaven has donned fresh blue!
I’ve done with winter wrappings,
With furs and velvet trappings;
You’ve simply got to dress me
Fkiiu head to foot anew!
“The modern Mrs. Grundies,
To whom each woman kneels,
Decree a burst of spending
For joy of cold days ending;
I must have georgette undies,
1 must have Louis heels.
“For tennis, balls and races,
For clubs and auction-tea,
I want ‘creations’ chiefly,
But still, to put it briefly,
From lip-stick to shoe-laces,
I want whate’er I see!”
Gay eyes, gay skies are sunny, ■ V
Sweet, airs, sweet lips speak clear.
Oh, husbands, clutch your purses,
Breathe secret prayers and curses,
The Month of Spending Money,
The Minx of Months is here!

“The Overlander”: Here’s another long-
distance performance. About a quarter of a century
ago one James White, after finishing his breakfast in
Broken Hill on a Tuesday morning, saddled his
hack, a big Sir Oliver animal (the breed was well-
known on out-back race tracks in N.S.W.), and
headed him north for Terapera station, on the Wil-
son River, about 80 miles beyond the Queensland
border. He jogged his pracl along day and night,
with the exception of an occasional break of no
longer than half an hour to give the animal a
feed at obliging carriers’ waggons. He arrived at
his destination in time for 6 p.m. dinner on the
Thursday, three clays after leaving the Silver City—
and the distance was about 320 miles. One of
White’s bush friends, whom he met on the third
morning out, inquired when he left the Hill, and,
when told, said “Garn, your horse looks too fresh.”
The questioner is still alive; but the heroes of the
journey are both dead. White weighed over 12st.
“Arrilcurra”: “Almurta” (B. 6/9/’23) is
the only one whose contribution about the Ragged
Thirteen isn’t a poor guess. He is certainly right in
crediting Sandy- Myrtle (Alex. McDonald) with being
the leader. The nearest the mob who went by that name
ever got to C. Queensland (where all the guessers
reckon they started from) was somewhere along the
O.T. line about Barrow or Tennant’s Creek. Leigh
Creek (now Copley), in S. Aus., 370 miles north of
Adelaide, was the starting-point, and anyone who
limited the names of the mob to 13 would stop a
long way short. Jim Woodford was another of the
original members, many of whom dropped- out and
were replaced as the trip proceeded. I got my in-
formation from Sandy himself, and Jimmy Woodford
certified to the correctness of it. Tucker for the
mob was got by paying for it —-sometimes —but mostly
by means of forged orders on station managers and
storekeepers, or by the direct-action method in the
ease of meat. Many a bullock fell to the rifle of
one of the mob, and no one was game enough to do
anything. Even to the policy the Ragged Thirteen
were law-abiding citizens —although, according to
Sandy, they didn’t offer any challenges to the police.
There were some good men in the force in those days.
To take Sandy’s word for it, they were a mob of
toughs and thieves and bandits —but there was a
strong element of the comic-opera bandit about them.
While there is no doubt that they were an ugly crew,
ready for a fight if a fight was necessary, yet no
white woman was frightened or boundary-rider or
lone bushman scared at the passing by of the
“Thirteen.”
“The Toiler”; About. 40 years ago on a
Lachlan (N.S.W.) station they had a number of
square iron tanks filled with water and left at vari-
ous places to supply the men in dry times. A
boundary-rider struck one of these tanks that was
nearly empty, and, as he could not reach the- water,
he tilted it slighty on one side and got into it. His
horse, smelling the water, put its head into the tank
and was unable to withdraw it. The man, who was
nearly smothered by the horse’s breath, was obliged
to hack the animal’s head off With his pocket-knife
to save himself.
“Pick”: Sheep display much uneasiness
and do a lot of searching for water when first shut
off f|, om a drink; but then they settle down and
appear contented with-
out it. I once saw
the overseer of Bibben-
luke station (N.S.W.)
take a mob of ration
wethers to the rive:
to drink, after they
had spent six weeks
of a wilting summer
in the waterless shear-
ers’ paddock. The
Woollies simpiy jumped
the stream and greedily
tore into the green
weeds along the banks.
Only one or two sipped
at the water. Goats,
too, can keep off the
booze for , any length
of time. Qn Merriman
Island, in Wallaga
Lake (South Coast,
N.S.W.), a herd of
from 20 to 40 goats
lived for years. There
is no fresh water nor
any catchment on the
island, which is only a
few acres in extent.
The perfumery existed
on drifting seaweeds
principally, and except
in rainy weather never
had water. Yet they
were always fat and
flourishing.
“Yarrum” : The new hand, going out early
one morning to work with the boss, noticed that
Cocky. carried a gun. Asked what he was going to
shoot, the boss said ’possums. “Bute ’ -said-Ghoom,
“there ain’t no ’possums about at daylight.” “No,”
he was told, “but there’ll be any gorsquantitv when
we are getting back.”
* * * »
“Jimmy Possum”: “Blunder-Buss’s” re-
ference (B. 30/8/’23) to two fellows who riskily
cooked a damper in a pile of ashes left by a ’roo
shooter reminds me. A w’hile back a Bananaland
doctor was mystified by the illness, of a man whose
symptoms indicated arsenical poisoning. The
patient, a ’roo shooter, insisted that he became ill
after eating a damper which he had cooked himself.
Sawbones put the sick man through a severe cross-
examination, eliciting the fact that he had cooked
the damper in the ashes of his camp fire. This
gave Pills- an idea. “Did you throw arsenic into
the fire at any time?” he asked. After thinking
awhile, the patient declared he hadn’t. “But,”
he. added, as an after-thought, “now you come to
mention it, the flamin’ - -poison- tin boiled over one.
day when I was makin’ some wash to paint th'
skins.” And that cleared up the mystery.
“Paroo Peter”: Recently on a station in
W. Queensland a white leghorn rooster was executed,
preparatory to Sunday’s dinner, and, on being opened
up, was found to contain a fully-developed egg, with
shell and all intact. The womenfolk wore superstitious
about it, and the roohenster never reached the table.
AN ASTONISHITNG AGE-
KNOWALL (at breakfast-table): "More than 6000
elephants a year go to make piano-keys
WIRE WHISKERS: "Spare me days! It’s wonderful, young feller, what yer can train
animals ter do.”
“Wart” : “Billy Brolga” (B. 6/9/’23) asks
if any Abo. has tried to catch a wild duckling
alive in the water. I have caught a young black
duck alive by swimming after it. A party of us,
fishing in the Lake River at the back of Cveßsy
(Tas.), disturbed a fully-fledged mountain duck that
could flutter for about 100 yards. These birds are
not much good for the pot, but they are about the
handsomest of Australian ducks, and one of the party
wanted a specimen for ,a pet. After a few attempts
at flight the youngster took to the water and evaded
us by diving. He settled in a pool aboht 50yds.
long, 15yds. broad, and in some places 10ft. deep.
We surrounded the pool and threw sticks—-not to hit,
but to try to shepherd him close to our landing-nets.
But it was no go, and at last I took off my clothes
and dived in. When the duclc came up near me
and dived again, I dived after him. The air
bubbles caught in his feathers fnade him luminous
in the green water. He went up stream like a
miniature torpedo, but made no attempt to dodge-
apparently instinct told him that he was quite safe
from pursuit under water. After he had gone some
distance a few feet from the bottom, with me a few
feet from his tail, he squatted down between two
rocks, and allowed me to put my two hands round
his wings and bring him to the surface. Then he
struggled; but it was too late. We took him to a
farmyard at Bishopsbourne, where there were dozens
of queer pets, but he refused to be tamed; he would
hardly touch food, and after a few weeks pined
away and died. Then I was sorry I’d caught him.
One can usually tame birds caught very youiig; but
when they are old enough to have had a taste of
freedom the odds are 10 to 1 against.
“8010 Creek”: This is a good season for
bower-birds. E. Nubiing, a member Of the Ornitho-
logists’ Union, who spends a lot of his time; study-
ing the satin bower-birds in the N.S.W. National
Park, has registered 75 bowers there this Spring—
the largest number he has found yet. At one
place there are half a dozen within a few yards.'
In fact, a start has been made with the flat, or,
rather, the semi-detached habit. Two bowers have
been built together, the one central wall of sticks
serving for both. This labor-saving device is some-
thing quite new for bower-birds. As most of the
park was burnt out last summer, there are plenty
of the small dead sticks of which the bowers are
built.
“Bill R”: “FY7” (B. 13/9/’23) hungers
for information about the aboriginal sling. It was
made with a long rope of stringy-bark, and had a
smooth, grooved stone tied securely at each end. It
does not appear to have been in general use among
the tribes, but the grooved stones are often found
around the old Binghi camping-grounds by Lake
George (N.S.W.). Very old residents of the locality
say that the sooty hunters used the contraption by
whirling it among the legs of fleeing kangaroo mobs,
arid that often the animals were hobbled and brought
down in that -way. Poet Henry Kendall was evi-
dently aware of the device when he wrote The line
“The nullah, the sling and the spear” in his “last
of His Tribe.”
“Mag”: “Jim Carew” (B. 30/8/’23) is
astray in saying kingfishers build mostly in the
hollows in big trees near the water’s edge. In Q.
they build miles from water—on the next-door
neighbor’s clothes-line post, for instance. The blue-
and-white bird called by boys the land kingfisher
prefers for its nest a white-ant nest on the trunk of
a tree, and not always a vacated nest, either, as
“Paul C.” (same B.) suggests. The water king-
fisher has a dirty-red breast, and is the one alluded
to by “Yarrum” (B. 2/8/’23). This bird builds
only in the banks of fresh-water creeks. The nest
is usually concealed by the drooping foliage of trees,
and is exceedingly hard to find.
“Jacky Roo” : A Charleville (Q.) cobber
of mine wants me to call “Barcoo” (B. 6/9/’23) a
liar for saying that the wool-carrying motor-lorry
has come to stay in Western Bananaland. My friend
quotes the experience of Tom Andrews, known every-
where as “The Road Hog” and owner of the crack
horse-team in the West. Tom experimented with a
motor-lorry in 1920, and made a few unprofitable
trips-r-and: the thing has been lying for two years
at the Nive Downs pub, 77 miles from Charleville.
Tom has gone back to his neddies again, and swear-
by ’em.
“Bouragi”: Not all the missionaries make
their Papuan brown sheep wear clothing, as my
friend “Fuzzy-top MeNorth” suggests (B. 6/9/’23).
The Anglican Mission has never insisted on more
than the waistcloth, and that only in public. I re-
THAT'S HOW.
“So you've married agon, 'are you. 'Ow do
you find yer ’ usband?"
“Mostly by lookin' in the pubs."
commend “Fuzzy-top” to read Anatole France's
“Penguin Island,” and learn how the Devil tempted
the naked but innocent Penguin people to their ruin
by dressing a pretty young female in a full feminine
equipment which he brought with him for the pur-
pose.

SIGNS OF SPRING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Long, shaggy hair from my old cob is falling,
The mud no longer gathers on his legs;
And in the yard the liens are cackling, calling
My wife to gather eggs.
Then comes the scent of jonquils from the garden
Where violets shyly try to make a show ;
Kach day the beds so quickly set and harden,
I wonder how things grow.
A spreading tree, with branches hanging lowly,
Rests on the fence beside my lucerne patch,
Where one or two old cows are making slowly
Against the bole to scratch.
The ground is thick with caterpillars crawling,
That crunch beneath my bluchers as I walk ;
They banquet where the capeweed’s lush and sprawl-
ing,
And legve the tattered stalk.
Our spotted cow, that lately went a-roaming
(She'd always yield a gallon and a half),
Returned as I sat smoking in the gloaming
And brought a lanky calf.
Out in the bush, where lies my daily duty,
Half-feathered magpies vainly try to fly;
The hills are grand, in silent, sombre beauty,
Outlined against the sky.
The spokes of wheels on sulkies shake and rattle
And rap a noisy greeting- to the sun;
They sound like some old harpy’s ceaseless tattle
Against an absent one.
Poised on a leaf a butterfly is dreaming.
Bright-winged as any dancing maiden’s cloak;
And overhead galahs are harshly screaming—
A crow begins to croak.
A big brown fly slips from my luncheon hamper,
Where rest the cuts of juicy roasted meat
Between crisp flakes of white and buttered damper—
I’ll look before- I eat.
THE ALTERNATIVE.
“Yis, sorr, wurrk is scarce, but Oi got a job last Sunday that
brought me in a pound."
"What—you broke the Sabbath ?”
"Well, sorr. 'twas was ar us had to be broke."
A giant moth breaks from its cocoon prison
And hovers low before it makes a flight,
While ants swarm on the log from which I’ve risen,
The kind that always bite.
Out on the plain the dust has lost its binding.
And rolls before each breeze that passes by ;
And here and there a willy-willy’s winding
In spirals to the sky.
The tinge of red has left the women’s noses;
The freckles are appearing one by one;
But cheeks are still as pink as. the new roses
That droop beneath the sun.

“Jay Aye”: When fishing for bream in
the Glenelg River (Vic.) my companion, a Mount
Gambier (S.A.) publican, landed a remarkable “40
pounder.” He had cast a hand-line and, having had
a bite, pulled in to rebait. As he did so, we noticed
something glittering in the clear water, and for
some seconds my cobber’s heart was in his mouth,
in casting, the line had formed a half-hitch around
his diamond scarf-pin and extracted, it unnoticed,
fortunately, the hitch held and the pin was recovered.
“Phew!” he said, with relief. “That pin cost me
4 0 quid.” y
“D.F.”: That marsupial which might have
been a kangaroo (B. 13/9/’23) figures in the frontis-
piece of a work published at Antwerp in 1593 by
the widow and sons of Cornells de Jode. The beast
has a body rather like a goat’s, with a short tail, a
head like a deer, and four legs all much about the
same size. Between the front, legs is a pouch with
the heads of two young ones sticking out of it. An
earlier edition of the same work about 1580 does not
contain this; strange beast. Of course the American
opossum, which is a marsupial, was known to the
Spaniards before this, but it is a little creature
about the size of a cat.
*****
“Numbugga”: For many years a genial
old butcher in Warialda (N.S.W.) has been daily
accompanied on his rounds by a white cockatoo. Cocky
generally flies ahead and announces himself from the
gate. When the boss is delivering in Kelly’s Gully
(four miles distant) the bird is often 10 minutes ahead.
I have seen Cocky fly through a band of wild brothers
era route. He seldom 'rides on the cart, and his
trips are strictly business ones, as he never accom-

“Bouragi” : “Gregor’s” account of Papuans
as torturers (B. 6/9/’23) does not fit in with my.
experience or the written records of such an obser-
ver as William Macgregor. As a conscious torturer
the Papuan does not exist in Sir William’s volumi-
nous reports, or in the experience of any of the
more reliable Papuan officials of this or other days.
The only resemblance to deliberate torture I can
recall was At Mambare Beach, after Green’s murder
at Tamata in the ’nineties. An old white miner,
who had fled down river in a panic, climbed into a
bushy tree, and the natives who followed him,
in disdain, ; ordered a lot of small boys to stone
him out. When the poor old bird was brought
down, he was killed and eaten. Certainly the North
Eastern Papuan will break a prisoner’s legs to keen
him from running away, till there is time to eat
him comfortably, just as they break the wings of
birds or the legs of animals for a similar reason.
I am sure there is no idea here of torture for
THE LOGIC OF BLACK BROTHER

B OORI: “ No, boss; only one together. I bin find three ’nother phella
mixed up alonga one pig belongin’ to ole Jimmy Young.”
torture’s sake. Such dismemberment of the living
as “Gregor” describes is unknown in British Papua,
for blood :; is never wasted, if possible,’' and the
Papuan is; quite beyond understanding such elabo-
rate surgical processes as artery tying. The corpse
when cold is most neatly cut up and prepared for
cooking, and though hungry Papuans occasionally
will throw a half-stunned pig on the fire to singe
him, they; are far too appreciative of the chefs art
to ruin such an esteemed plat as a man, or prefer-
ably a young woman, by such crude methods. They
would as soon think of drenching the delicate
course with Worcester sauce.
“Westo”: Among the prodigals I’ve found
a man of vision. He is a bachelor on a selection
near Yeulba (Q.) from which he periodically sallies
forth in search of work to help things along. In
WHERE HE DREW THE LIRE.
Mrs. Mossman (to tramp) : “You say you are starving, and
yet you keep a dog!”
Hungry Henry: “ Spare me days, mum, I can’t eat me dorg !”
his absence the four dogs he keeps for mustering
time are chained each to the leg of a useless
horse which the selector has shot for the purpose.
I saw the canines after such a three-weeks’ debauch.
There was plenty of dog, but little horse. The
SOS had evidently been sent out, as the owner was
on his way back to perpetrate a" further massacre.
This man may one day solve the superfluous horse
problem with which Queensland is now afflicted. .

“Old Timer”: Does the Council -know a
better way than the follow-ing to poison ia dingo ?
Shoot a parrot, pick it up with a’ : piece: of clean
paper (do not touch it with the hands), .ride past
a beast the dingo has killed and drop the parrot
beside it. Warrigal prefers parrots to meat. If the
first parrot goes you know the dingo is- .returning
to his kill. Then get another parrot, opefi its head
and put in as much strychnine as will, stay on the'
point of the small blade of a penknife, tying the
head together with a piece of cotton. " After.: the::
dingo eats the parrot he starts:, ory the kill, jdies
near it —and the bonus is safe..

“Centre”: The largest and - fiercest
“dingoes”—they’re really all crossbreds—are to be
found in the northern and central parts of Bananaland.
Some years ago,
while belting dense
scrub about 25
miles north of
Gympie, I had
trouble with a
huge yellow-coated
brute in the'clear-
ing. He .seemed
to resent my being
there, and slowly
advanced towards
me with- the hair
along his neck and
back standing on
end, and his teeth
shO w i n g.' My
mate arrived op-
portunely, and the
dingo, hearing him
coming up behind,,
was off to one side
like a shadow. The
same brute treed
my mate for sev-
eral hours. He had
a black slut run-
ning with him that
time, and they
camped below the
tree and howled.
My arrival with
the Winchester stopped the concert.

“H.E.R.”: “Carisbrook, Jun.’s” par. (B.
23/8/’23) re cattle making hardware shops of their
stomachs clears up a mystery of my youth. Just
near my dad’s house in outer Rockhampton a steam-
roller was left one night. In the morning it had
disappeared and was not heard, of again. Now I
can remember distinctly two cows at dusk com-
mencing to lick the oil oozing down the engine’s
sides.
“Wandi”: “Yarrum” (B. 6/9/’23) says
“the Murray cod did not get its name from the
big river, but v\as so called after Terence Aubrey
Murray, who first turned it loose in Australia.” The
Murray cod (Oligorus mac-
quariensis) is indigenous
to Australia, and is not
found anywhere else. Its
habitat is the Murray-Dar-
ling system and the head-
waters of the Clarence and
Richmond rivers. About
50 years ago the big fish
was placed in Lake George,
where it did well, and in
the Yarra (Vic.), where it
was a failure. The cod is
a perch; so also are the
so-called black bream and
silver bream caught in
fresh waters, about which
there was some argument
in the Council recently. A
Murray-Darling abo. name
of the cod is “murree,”
which suggests that the
river may have got its
name from the fish, and
not the fish from ibe
river. The specific name
suggests that either the
type fish'was taken in the
Macquarie River or it was
named after Governor Mac-
quarie. The “black bream”
is called the Macquarie
perch; and I have found
that fish more abundant
in the Severn River than
anywhere else. There
is also the Murray
perch (like a small cod),
which belongs to the Mur-
ray River; and the golden
perch, or yellow-belly, the
prize fish of the Way bn ok
—in the Paroo, Bulloo,
Ward and Barcoo waters.
The pride of the Richmond
and Clarence, next to tne
cod, is the silver-perch.
•“Wolf”: Many years ago, on Wallaga Lake
(N.S.W.), I saw the late Bill Rumph with one barrel
shoot two black ducks on the wing, flying in opposite
directions; and though both birds fell dead, they
were picked up quite a quarter of a mile apart,
which should .give some idea of their velocity. Bill
appeared to focus about 20ft. ahead of each bird.
* * * *
“Gnip”: On the subject of the uncivilis-
ableness of dingoes, let “Two Seas” (B. 6/9/’23)
get an eyeful of this. On July 3, 1916, H.M.A.S. En-
counter was anchored in Cambridge Gulf, about 10
miles from Wyndham. A crew of Binghis came
alongside in a queer contraption, with a pure-bred
dingo on a chain, which they presented to our curio-
hunting skipper, Captain Claude Cumberlege. The
animal was most ferbeious, and the abos. had to chain
him to one of our Q.D. guns. A week later he was
let loose, and only had one fault—he would persist
.in padding silently about a foot astern of the ship’s
pet goat, much to that animal’s annoyance. In Dar-
win he got in the ditch somehow —I don’t know
whether he jumped or fell in, but, anyhow, he headed
straight for the beach. We watched him land and
said “Good-bye, Dingbat.” An hour later the quar-
termaster fished him out on to our gangway. On
arrival in Sydney he was given to the'Zoo. During
his sojourn, in. the ship he became as tame as any
dog I’ve known. If “Two Seas” doubts this, he
knows where to go for confirmation —Captain Cumber-
lege would not take much finding.
“B. Wire” : Talking about dogs counting,
what about my black-and-tan Jock as a starter?
I was bringing some killing wethers to the yard, to
draft off a score of merino rams which were boxed
with them, and when we got close up I went ahead
to open the gate, leaving Jock to bring the mob
along. Approaching the gate he gave a yap at the .
rear. The wethers, to a sheep, shot ahead of the
rams, and Jock, nipping round the wing, out in
between the two lots, let the rams go, and yarded
the wethers.

“Jay Aye’s” hard case:—
lie “Almurta” (B. 6/9/’23) on the Ragged
thirteen._ When employed in a bank at HergoM
Springs, in the ’eighties, I knew Sundy Myrtle (Alex-
ander McDonald) very well. He was then engaged
in the grog line. With a heavy express buggy,
drawn by four horses, and loaded with kegs arid
cases of spirits, he would start on his journey on
the overland telegraph line. He made no attempt to
hide his calling. On one occasion two policemen
were present when he started from the hotel. The
sergeant asked him in a jocular way what he intended
to do with the grog, and back came the prompt re-
ply: “Why, sell it, of course, you blanky fool.” An
Adelaide detective specially brought up to follow
Sandy was, unknown to him, a listener. The ’tec.
smiled to himself, and reckoned he had an easy job.
But, careless as Sandy appeared to be, he took no
risks. He would sell to no one he didn’t know well,
and those who knew Sandy would have shot themselves
sooner than give him away. He told me that once
he had sold clean out at a race meeting at £1 a
bottle, after a supply of water had been added to
his stock. On his return from a trip he would enter
the bank and empty a greasy old canvas-bag of its
contents, mostly station orders and cheques, “Count
’em up, lad, and let me know what I’m worth,” he
would say, and then make for the hotel. Once I
made a mistake of £lOO and reported the amount to
be £2BO. “Thought there was more. But no mat-
ter, have a drink,” was the only comment. Lator
when I told him of my error he chuckled “That’s
better; have another drink.” After several weeks t .f
hard going, during wKmfi half'his money would be
spent, he would set out for Port Augusta to finish
nis holiday and lay in a stock for the next trip. In
spite of his failings he was a grand old chap, and had
not an enemy in the country.

“Gecko” : Tell “Billy Brolga” (B. 6/9/’23)
that the simplest way to catch wild ducklings in
shallow pools is to take up an observation stance
close to the rim of the pond; then each time the
quarry breaks the surface, clap the hands instantly
and loudly. The duckling, disapproving of such un-
called-for applause, immediately descends without
having had time to take in fresh air. If the clap
is repeated each time the plunger bobs up for a
blow, in less than five minutes he will throw in the
towel, and the correct time to wade in to secure the
prize is when the exhausted squab refuses, or is un-
able, to respond further to the “clap-trap.” P.S. —
Should you want to keep and rear the brood, place
the panting mites when first secured in a shaded
receptacle (say a sugar-bag) for at least a 15-
minutes’ breather before tramping off with them;
otherwise they certainly will not recover from the
severe shock.
“32 x 40” : The best sleeper I ever met was
during the 1912 drought. I was droving 20,000 shorn
wethers across the Aramac Desert, and had shoved
the lot in a break one night on Aramae Greek. A
jaekeroo was put round at the back of the break as
a special precaution; nevertheless when I woke, at
about 3 o’clock, I found that every hoof had got out,
passing over a bit of ground Bft. wide between the
sleeping jaekeroo and a wire-fence which had been
used to make one side of the camp.

“Billy Brolga”: While some horses, like
some humans, have an enormous capacity for work,
and are often cruelly Overwrought as a result, others
have no stamina at all and are not worth owning.
Turned up her toes at 14 years the other day, a
saddle mare of mine who’d knock up on a warm
day in about 10 miles with less than 12st. aboard.
Twenty miles was the most she could stand at any
time, and she had to be handled with care to last
out that distance. Yet her mother often carried
me from daylight till dark ’roo shooting in rough
country, and then would be frisky enough for a
bolt or a buck. A strained heart as a result of
rough handling in the breaking-in probably has a
lot to do with the softness of some horses.
“Sarah”: On the North Coast (Q.) there
are two distinct patches where timber died in
the 1901-02 drought in a manner similar* to that
described by “Pick” (B. 16/8/’23) ; only in this
case practically everything that was on tie ridges
died —ironbark, gum, blue-gum, bloodwood and
stringy-bark all passed in. The only thing that
survived was what is commonly known as. Scrub-box,
or supple-jack. On the patches now one.' can see
tall dry tree trunks amid a mass of wattles.
* * * *
“Orion”: “Paul C.” (B. 30/S/’23) can’t
have used a gun much, or he wouldn’t have said
that the green-leek is the swiftest flier. At a fair
range, with the bird flying side-on, you’ve only
got to fire just in front of the beak, and Leelcy
will pitch out of the mob. The bronzewing-pigeon
and the swift require at least a foot of latitude to
bring them down; while, as for a pair of:-widgeon-
ducks racing before the wind, you’ve got to be
mighty quick on the draw to get the two shots
in, and you must fire fully a yard in front of your
bird, or there will be no roast duck for to-morrow's
dinner. . .
* * * *
“Yarrum”: For durable timber I don’t
think the ti-tree growing around Lake Macquarie
(N.S.W.) can ho beaten. At Belmont last week
I saw posts of it that had been in the ground for
40 years. They hadn’t started to decay, and the
buried portions were, if anything, better ‘than the
rest. Boyd Bros., of the lake, built a schooner
A HAIR-RAISING EVERT,
“Do you have to undo your heard before yon
clean your teeth, grandfather?”
some time ago and decked her with ti-tree. When
cleaned up that, deck was as white as the wings of
a gull. For flooring-boards, too, it hasn’t an equal.
The pity of it is this timber is being destroyed
ruthlessly by vandals. I’ve seen a galoot cut down
a big tree for the knee of a rowing-boat.
JOY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Though you lost your old tin match-box
When the cattle wheeled and broke,
And for many weary hours
You’ve been dying for a smoke,
When you’re nearing home at sundown
And, across the ten-mile plain,
You sight the roof where someone waits
To welcome you home again,
lou may think there’s naught so pleasing
In your uneventful life
As the cry of “Here comes Daddy!”
From the kiddies and the wife.
But when you’re longing for a smoke,
There’s no joy like the zest
"With which you find that grimy match
In the lining of your vest.

A cold wind blew over liandwick on Satur-
day, and a colder and dustier one on Mon-
day, and the wise bird carried a heavyweight
length of plumage to retire into while flutter-
ing in the Antarctic zone in front of the
stands. There were furlongs of monkey fur,
skunk and ermine that looked particularly
good to her who was in organdie, hut those
who had the fur generally had also the fat,
and the dream in muslin drew consolation,
and curved her lips into a smile even though
her teeth chattered in her rosebud mouth.
Organdie was the wear of the young; and
marocain, crepe silk and the utilitarian
crochet were the chosen of the smart weight-
for-age entrants in the frocking contest.
Green and brown were the Derby Day colors,
and Paisley, which the initiated tell us is a
fade-out in the London fashion-market, seems
just to have caught our fancy. It was
everywhere; in stamped, not woven, designs,
of course. And quite as übiquitous was the
crinoline hat, mostly almond green. But
herein lies danger. If you haven’t (and
how many of us have?) a roseleaf com-
plexion, or one of those golden skins through
which the pomegranate color flushes, keep
away from the almond-green hat! Rand-
wick on Saturday might have been an out-
going liner just passing the Heads, judging
by the multitude of seasick-looking lasses
who billowed about the stands. The leaf-
browns and bronze tones were kinder; and
black, mostly in georgette, beautifully pleated,
was as sure a winner as dear David. Shoes
were of the sandal-and-strap variety, and
mostly black, and one joyous pair of red
Morocco flashed past, as arresting as a blithe-
some chord struck in the middle of a Funeral
March. Capes—silly, delicious trifles of
pleated georgette and crepe de Chine —were
everywhere; and sunshades wore ruffles and
were of the tiniest diameter.
There were no vice-regals on Saturday, and
lots of the Davidsons’ personal friends stayed
away; but apart from the gubernatorial pew
the stands were crowded to overflowing.
Tired policemen worked at the totalisators
keeping the queues in order, and the god-
desses of fate who push the ticket of fortune
or disaster towards you through the little
windows couldn’t take a minute off 1o feed
a little powder to their fevered noses. Heaven
pity any one of them suffering from hay-
fever !
The frocking was bright and emotional,
but never rushed up to fever heat; the only
two who threatened to hurst the mercury
were Annette Kellerman and the lady like
a reincarnated Cleopatra who cooled off the
temperature of her frocking (the skirt draped
so that it resembled a harem skirt when she
walked) by the coolness of its grey coloring.
Round and round this lady’s head was
wound a grey veil that fell, after giving a
yasmak effect, to the hem of her skirt.
Annette looked as if she had plucked the
family ostrich, tintexed the crop pink and
mauve, and ruffled the result into a Pavlova
stage effect. Up in the Official Stand George
Lambert combined business with pleasure,
and sketched the horses’ nostrils. Of course,
it might have struck some artists to do this
during the trial runs, but of such is not our
George. Oscar Asche brought his weight to
bear in the Members’ Stand, and Eve Grey
clothed her golden-haired slimness in brown
linens. Mrs. Malcolm Mackellar was one of
the good lookers, in frocking of a subdued
tone, surmounted by a shady hat of burnt
orange. With her was Dorothea Mackellar,
rather extinguished under a treacherous
almond-green hat. Mrs. Gordon Wesche
trimmed her navy crepe with strings and
strings of cockleshells or their baby sisters
that the Paris designer is so fond of for
the moment.
Mrs. Dalton, from Orange, wore her hand-
some vellum lace frock without sleeves at
all; Eadith Walker flew brown that held a
glint of tangerine; Mrs. Baillieu (Mel-
bourne) brought a young Shackell niece,
auntie in navy silk richness, with a brown
shaded plume that simply dripped money
about her navy crin. hat; fresh-taced niece
in black pleated georgette with a small hat
composed of russet ribbon. Mrs. Otway
Falkiner was another of Melbourne’s super-
dressers. Mrs. Nelkin—-Lesley Madden
aforetime —vibrated under a flower-laden
hat; and Mrs. Pat Osborne, who was with
her, gummed her faith to black. Elizabeth
Onslow sported orange tones, and the blonde
Margaret Osborne’s choice was black and
white. Surgeon John McKelvey’s wife rose
triumphant above lettuce-green frocking, but
she in her wisdom had chosen a white hat
wreathed with gardenias, which flower
bloomed again at the girdle of her frock.
Mrs. Tom Rolin, in silver-grey, was another
eye-arresting figure; so was the newly-
returned Mrs. Claude Parbury in nut-brown.
The dwindling Navy was represented by
the Commander Craufurds, the Nelson Clover
couple, and Captain and Mrs. Danby. The
Neil McDonalds’ youngest chick was in fluffy
pink; Moira Brady and Eileen Waley were
other good-looking youngsters, and among the
youngest married set Mrs. Dundas Allen and
Mrs. Oscar Ireland (she was popular Una
Barton) were winners.
Monday saw the Lieutenant-Governor
Cullens receiving in the vice-regal compart-
ment ; the lady's all-black was made with a
flowing cape effect, and daughter Ailsa
girdled her white frock with a sash of bold
design. The Spencer Bruntons were con-
sistent punters, and Mrs. Sep Levy’s sand-
colored smartness defied the dust. Mrs.
Lachlan Beaton and Ruby Adams were two
of the week’s best frockers; Dame Alice
Chisholm and Mrs. Earle Page both backed
the popular golden-brown; and good-looking
Mrs. Jim Gordon subdued the glory of sap-
phire-blue frocking with a smartly-neat grey
hat.
If it had been a private dance or a big
society flutter for charity, the trusty Rolls-
Royce would have served as the private bar,
and all would have gone merry as a mar-
riage-bell. But being a Nartists’ ball, the
first hour of morning brought a raid to the
basement of the Town Hall and three arrests
for sly-grog selling. That matter hasn’t
been decided yet; but meantime pass the
arnica and the cold cream, for nearly 3000
of Sydney’s dancers, masked and in fancy
costume, crowded into the municipal halls
of purity last Thursday, and as the going
was willing, both above and below stairs,
there’s a long, long trail of bruises bo be
anointed.
The decorative effect was as though the
city fathers’ preserve was doing a shimmy
over the Prodigal’s return. The place was
bedizened with cubist mask and mad, glad
friezes dazzling to the eye. Here fled Folly
with a motley train. Nymphs and satyrs,
models and wowser gentlemen consorted in
a grddy whirl aloft,. while a jade god looked
down impassively on all. Balloons and
streamers gambolled in the riggings, and the
Lieut.-Governor Cullens called a vice-vice-
regal blessing on the sausage-and-cheeso
supper in the basement.
D. H. Souter, an awe-inspiring cannibal
chief, was entirely disguised, excepting for
his burr-r-r, behind tattooings, a Caliban
crop of hair, and a jazz garter that clove
the wilds every now and then with a high-
voltage baby-rattle. His chief headsman
bore aloft a menacing banner which read,
“Yes, we have No Bananas!” and in his
train came hibiscus- and bead-clad lasses—
graceful daughter Ailsa one of these. Mrs
Lyster Ormsby tripped merrily in some
parrot-hued fringing, although her husband,
billowing along as a red-bearded missionary,
was destined for the stewpot that the clan
swung and clattered. Writing-girl Blanche
d’Alpuget, with her lustrous black hair hibis-
cus-wreathed, and some of father’s island
mats for covering, made a fascinating
Samoan. With her she brought a slim young
cousin swathed in a Spanish shawl. The
Pat Levys came, she as a bathing-girl. The
Gayfield Shaw couple slipped back into the
Pompadour period, secs. Mrs. Ellis St. John
and sister Parry were twin witches, and
tiny Mrs. Willie McMillan was the perfect
brownie. There were bare-backed ladies
whose front armor must have been sustained
by faith and a postage-stamp. There were
pierrots and pierrettes, and free kisses and
free beer, and Frank Morton with a daugh-
ter as an exquisite lady of old Pekin. Hand-
some Dr. Dakin captured another heart or
two, and didn’t even know it. Jack Lindsay
was there eating an onion-and-beer supper
in the basement, and so many other Austra-
lian poet laureates that they probably real-
ised the road to Fame was more crowded
than they had thought.
There were ladies in tiger-skins, and a few
tigers in ladies’ skins. “Cabaret Girl” Madge
Elliott arrived after the show, and nearly
put out the lights with the glitter of her gold
cloak and a towering flame-feather head-
dress. Dulcie Deamer flung a leopard-skin
about her, and wasn’t the only one who had
a few “spots.” Some other girls flew pre-
historic costumes; one -of them showed
through her legs the blue blood in her veins.
Roy Agnew made his dancing debut as
Sandy McNab, and the Kambala Miss Rose-
bys and Mrs. de Beaupuis made a stately
group from Seville. Among the Spanish
grandees mention must be made of Alathea
Solomons, who suggested magnolia-scented
nights, guitars, stilettos, red heels and lace
fans. There were pretty girls and lots of f.a.q.
men; and everybody wasn’t drunk. One
lofty newspaper person objected to meeting
butchers and small tradesmen; but what does
it matter if you pay cash?
And, best of all, there will be something
like £l5OO to hand to the St. John Ambu-
lance Society.
For convenience sake, the Lieut.-Governor
Cullens have shut up TTegoyd and gone into
residence at Government House; and Dame
Margaret and the children, with the faithful
Miss Henderson, are putting up at the cot-
tage in the grounds till the Euripides sails
on the 24th. Dame Margaret’s first outing
since the funeral was taken the other day,
when Commander Craufurd lent his steam
launch, and the family spent what will pro-
bably he their last day on the harbor. Mrs.
Alexander Gordon and her kiddies went to
the hilly-tea drinking. Probably Daphne
and Diana will be saddest of all the day they
pay their farewell visit to the two small
tombstopes erected by Sir Walter in Govern-
ment House grounds to'the memory of the
pets that died last year—to Brflce, the
Scotch terrier, on whose tablet is inscribed,
“We understood each other. He was a loyal
Scot!” and to the cockatoo that the family
brought from the Seychelles.
Viscountess Jellicoe and her chicks paid
one visit to the threatre while passing
through Sydney on their trip to China. They
called in at “Smilin’ Through,” mainly to let
Lucy Jellicoe have a word with her old
school-friend the Forbes-Robertson girleen,
whose stage name is Anne McEwen.
The really swish flutter of Friday night
was the dance at the Rose Bay Golf Club,
given by the Colonel Macarthur Onslows bo
introduce niece Margaret (she’s a bud of
the Macquarie Grove branch of the Camden
clan) to society. The flowers were wonder-
ful, great bowls of tulips glowing amidst the
more pallid anemone and arum-lily. The
hostess wore black satin and lace, while
daughter Elizabeth and Margaret both ruffled
in pale-blue taffeta and silver. Among the
200 or more guests were tribes of Knoxes,
Osbornes, Horderns and Macarthurs. One
of the most graceful frocks was worn by
Mrs. George Vivers, who glittered in gold
lace over silver-grey satin. Barbara Knox,
in crepe drapings the color of a crushed
raspberry, was another striking figure. The
vivid Mrs. Alfred Turnbull glowed like an
amethyst, and Mrs. Claude Parbury clothed
her blondeness in black. Black seemed the
favored shade even among the younger set.
The second dinner-dance for St. Luke’s
crowded the Wentworth on Friday evening.
The big ballroom held hundreds: hither came
all society that wasn’t at the Macarthur
Onslow flutter. The hospital’s secretary,
Frank Lamb, gambolled in a green-and-yellow
paper cap that, like Mary’s flock, carried
tails behind it. The Wade lady, who was
president of the ball committee, could not
come, but was represented by her daughters,
Mrs. Young and Mrs. Kerr, in grey and
mauve silk; Mrs. Roystone Davey, tvho is
one of St. Luke’s strongest supports, finished
off her handsome trappings of black and
silver with long pearl ear-rings; Hugh Deni-
son was with his lady, who draped the glory
of a Paisley shawl over black georgette.
Matron Taylor had slipped into a mauve and
grey shimmer; Dr. Kate Knowles was in
black; and the Storey lady, who was one of
the ball’s vice-presidents, wore her lilac-and-
pink paper cap as effectively as a girl in her
teens. Mrs. Arthur Allen and Mrs. Hemsley
were other handsome frockers.
There were no frills about Molly Owen's
wedding to Ted Knox the other day. Sim-
plicity was the keynote of the bridal fnock-
ing, though St. Mark’s, Darling Point, was
crowded with fashionable elect to watch the
riveting of the two well-known Sydney
families. The middle aisle had been turned
into a lane of peach blossom, and between
the delicate blooms Molly walked on father’s
arm in a lace frock the color of a stretch of
sand ; the crinoline hat that hid her blushes
was the same shade, and thereon an almond-
green plume waved a benediction. A pearl
necklace, which creamed about her throat,
was the bridegroom’s gift. The two mothers
wore black georgette frocking, and so did
Mrs. Percy Owen; the bride’s sister, Mrs.
Din Garvan, supplied the touch of color in
the sombre wedding group with crimson
pipings on her ivory crepe de Chine. Mollie
is the second chick of the H. P. Owens, and
Ted is the elder son of Mrs. Tom Knox, of
Bellevue Hill. There were no bridesmaids
and no reception ; but the day before Mrs.
Din Garvan had hostessed a party over 100
strong at the Rose Bay golf house.
Art-critic “Bill” Moore induced poetess
Dora Wilcox to take another plunge into
matrimony on Monday. (Her first husband
was the Belgian Professor Ilamelius.) St.
John’s saw the quiet little ceremony, which
was in Canon Beck’s hands.
Lady Forbes-Robertson told a story against
herself at a tea-party given for her during
the week at the Mary Elizabeth by a group
of women-playwrights, poets and inky way-
farers. “Do tell us, Lady Forbes-Robertson,”
gushed one of the youngest guests, “what
you consider the most romantic gift of your
career!” The slim lady with the simple
manner replied, with gravity in her tones
but laughter in the eyes under the shady
hat: “Ah, yes, there’s what I call nay jewel
song!” ‘Yes?” breathed the inquirer. “Once
after a performance a young man came to
my room and insisted on pouring out on my
table a stream of magnificent gems. He was
entranced with my art. He begged leave to
call on me to-morrow. He implored my
acceptance of the gift. Next day I had a
caller, but not the young man. It was his
mother. In the most polite way in the
world she requested the return of tne jewels.
I was rather embarrassed, but I brought
out the jewels and handed them oyer, ex-
plaining that the young man had insisted on
my taking them because he was an admirer
of my art. The lady took a rapid mental
inventory of the jewels, then gathered her-
self together for departure. ‘Your art!’ she
moaned. ‘Ah, my poor son, he is quite
mad!’ ”
A long generation of Sydney women inter-
ested in stitehery has known “Mrs. Bennett,
of the Arcade.” The lady, who had gone out
of the business of recent years, was the
widow of Christopher Bennett, and he was
the mechanically-minded brother of Samuel,
the founder of the Evening News. They
had two sons and a daughter; and it was at
the North Side residence of the daughter,
wife of barrister H. G. Edwards, that the
lady died a few days ago.
The big flutter to help the Hospice for
the Dying in the Town Hall on Monday
threatens to eclipse all other fancy-dress
dances of this season.
At the “Shore” F§te on Saturday from
8 to 9 p.m. Fred Popplewell (professional
golf champion of N.S.W.) will give a lec-
turette, illustrated with niblick and brassie.
Putting competitions will be on all the after-
noon.
The Leah Scott supper-dance at the Went-
worth on the 16th promises to be a glittering-
affair. Artistic circles have taken up the
idea of helping the Sydney singing girl to
continue her studies in London, and artist
Minns’s energetic little wife is behind the
big push. The artist himself is helping with
one of his exquisite water-colors, which is to
be auctioned for the fund.
The Girls’ Realm Guild is spreading a
festa 333 feet in the air next Tuesday, when
the roof of Hampton Court will be turned
into a sort of Oriental market. Lady
Forbes Robertson, who lives on the* premises,
is taking the automatic to the roof at 2.30
to open the function.
A Brisbane postscript:—
His Ex. went to the Exhibition concert hall to
hear Walter Kirby ard to witness the debut of
convent-reared Alma O’Dea, who, in a pretty cream
frock, contraltoed to the satisfaction of the multi-
tude. Among those who listened with him were
the Pitt Riverses, Sir Gerald Lenox-Oonyngham, Miss
Lenox-Conyngham, Michael Rogers and Capt. Harry
Hammond; while in the hall were the Chief Justice
and Mrs. McCawley, the P. J. Symeses, Dr. W. N.
Robertson, the Malcolm Camerons, Father Lane, Mrs.
A. P. Greenfield and Mrs. Kathleen Watson Dearden.
Mrs. Greenfield tea-ed Walter Ivirby at Lennon’s
amid roses and pink and white poppies, strawberries
and cream, and a band. The M. Cameron, Lane,
Wallis, Mark Harris and Forrest dames, Dr. Brunnich
and Father Lane helped to sw r ell a musical and
Sociable crowd.
Chaplain Herrington and his wife, who are heading
for Maoriland, had a send-off from the parishioners,
who handed her a black opal brooch and also gave
her daughters gold brooches w'ith Queensland gems.
Katie Cannan got a travelling clock and a big
bouquet from her pupils at her farewell shivoo, ana
her brigadier-general brother thanked the donors.
Thelma Robertson is taking over her classes. Mora
Stanley scored a manicure set and Miss Pianist Ste-
wart a jewel-case. Oriental dances and a “Babes in
the Wood” number, in which the babes were almost
babies, were charming items, and some of the High
School girls kicked eurhythmies.
Thomas Mcllwraith Taylor has seen his last
daughter, Melody, become a bride, the man in the
case being Mortimer Clark, of Talgai. St. Paul’s
Scotchbyterian Kirk was the scene of the transfor-
mation. Melody was in white and gold tinsel
brocade, and had a train of old Limerick with a
tulle veil and a silver coronet. Erica McConnell and
Joyce Darvall bridesmaided in cloth of gold. H.
Mort, of Franklyn Vale, best-manned, and J. Ban-
nister was groomsman. The Norwood Browns staged
the wedding breakfast.
The late Judge Virgil Power’s daughter May was
married the same night at St. Stephen’s to Leo RVap,
late A.I.F. This bride w'ore white brochS, with lots
of real lace. Brother Virgil Power gave her away,
Alan Lennon was best man, and the guests w r ere after-
wards feted by Mrs. Virgil Power.
Mrs. T. J. Ryan had a lot to do with the success
of the ball in the Trocadero to help the children’s
hospital. Sir Matthew went with Mrs. Pitt Rivers,
Miss Lenox-Oonyngham ar.d Capt. Hammond.
A Union Jack hid the casket in which old Captain
John Wilkinson journeyed to Toowong on the 28th.
He had been many years in the deep-sea trade anti
had a deal to do with the lighthouses along the
Bananaland coast. Timber-merchant Danniells, of
Cedar Creek, passed out at about the same time.
He had a mill at Canungra and was 91 at the end.

Melbourne’s Lost Dogs growled when
Mrs. Frank Clarke sent out cards for a
whirl for the night of their benefit ball, but
there was a louder snarl against some of
the best-known people on the ball committee
for joining the opposition trots. Luckily the
crowd roiled up in force to the ticket-
office and saved the threatened frost,
was a well-staged affair, for which chief
credit goes to the Montgomery sisters and
Maud Harvie, Mrs. Arthur Payne and head-
master Adamson. Gertrude Dix, in floating
black crepe panellings, and partnered by
L. Quinn, ran away with the fox-trotting
awards. Quinn, an English importation
now earning his crust on the Herald, has
made a habit of jazz prize-winning, no matter
with what partner. Irene Vanbrugh, con-
voyed by C. Hallard, blew in 20 minutes
before the witching hour, looking particu-
larly nice in crgpe draperies of tender green,
with green and gold swathing her well-
pcised head. She simply radiated cheerful-
ness, and soon showed that she was on inti-
mate terms with all the latest, dance-steps.
A bouquet of wild flowers was awarded her
by the committee, who also handed posies
to the Montgomery sisters. They, by the
way, are tripping across seas next month
after seeing the younger sister’s horse, Mari-
gold, do his dash, at Flemington. Mrs.
Payne was all a-glitter in crystal tulle, and
Miss Harvie a symphony in palest grey.
Gertrude Campbell Hogg’s stately beauty
shone out from a priceless setting of rare old
lace with trailing back folds of satin brocade
When she exchanged vows with the Percy
Austins’ eldest hope on Saturday afternoon.
The 200-year-old mesh had been lent by
Mabel Lilley, who had further loaned her
great-grandmother’s gold posy-holder to con-
tain the bridal forget-me-nots. The bro-
caded train had originally backed the wed-
ding finery of the bridegroom’s mother, and
the rich Limerick lace which veiled her
golden head was lent by another family inti-
mate, Mrs. Francis. Sister Edith, as brides-
maid, organdied in Spring-like green, which
frothed wmitely in the upper deckings; and
she had her fair head tucked into a black
picture-hat. The Rev. Pelham Chase, as an
old friend of the family, helped All Saints’
vicar Jones to adjust the knot. All the
young things twittered with excitement when
the bride fluttered down the aisle with an
unexpected string of pearls rivalling the
whiteness of her neck; the bridegroom had
hung them there during the register-signing
interval. Subsequently cake and confetti
were handed out at the Campbell Hoggs’ St.
Kilda residence.
With a pretence of seriousness, a daily
suggested Melba for the Agent-Generalship.
The notion was not original; Tommy Bent,
when Premier, said that as Nellie Mitchell
wasn’t available at under £25,000 a year, it
had been decided to continue Taverner in
the job.
One feature of the Melbourne Show this
year has been a model of a bush home. The
standing committee of the New Settlers’
League has sponsored it, and members have
been on hand to talk with any new settlers
who turn up to inspect. The model cottage
shows many “home” devices that the pioneering
women in Australia have used. The most
important item of all is, of course, the
national kerosene-tin. The household use of
this shiny container is marvellous. Every
kind of dish, bucket, scoop and flower-pot
can be hammered out of it—even whole
houses, while kerosene-tin chimneys are
dotted all over Outback.
Generally speaking, this year’s Show has
been intensely practical; and, in spite of
some shocking weather, the total attendance
for the nine days reached the 300,000 mark
of the previous year. Apart from the tricks
of the storm in the Show’s early days, the
only sensation provided was the discovery
that as good a way as any to color the few
white feathers that will creep into the black
leghorn’s tail is to dip them in tar. At any
rate, the birds that were treated with black-
lead failed to live up to their disguise, and
more than one prize card had to be removed
from a pen.
The Lauchlan Mackinnon dame passed out
the other day at Crediton (Eng.), where
the Argus knight has leased the Devonshire
homestead of the late Redvers Buller. Her
loss will be a cruel blow to him, as his im-
paired health had been her first consideration
for some years past. The poor lady had just
written to say the invalid was finding the
Devonshire air the best tonic he had yet
tried. She was a Miss Bundoch, and
was the adopted daughter of Lauchlan’s
late uncle (the first Argus Mackinnon), whose
wife was her aunt. The two Mackinnon
daughters are there to comfort their father, and
his only son is contemplating a trip across
seas early next year.
Aimee Shackell and cousin Sunday Bail-
lieu budded attractively at a picturesque ball-
party, staged by their respective mothers at
the Shackell homestead, Yailima, in the far-
end of Toorak. Little Aimee suggested an
ode to Spring in her pinky tulle flouncings
enmeshing rose petals, and cousin Sunday
was a fairy princess with her slim elegance
enfolded in silver lace belted with brilliants
between narrow lines of green. Mrs. Shackell
hostessed handsomely in inky satin, bright-
ened with jetted effects, while Mrs. Bail-
lieu wore an alluring smile above bronze-
beaded drapings, which were poised at the
waist with many-colored flowers. Mrs.
Shackell, the elder, also black-satined, came
to see grand-daughter Aimee enrolled as a
grown-up.
A whole platoon of Baillieus joined in the
revel, and S’Arthur Robinson and his wife
brought daughter Nancy. Mrs. Frank Clarke
danced in green silk, which started somewhat
late in the shoulder regions. Mrs. Charlie
Lyon radiated in pink brocade, and Mrs.
Leslie MacPherson looked stunning in misty
black. The Louis Nelkin pair, who trotted
off next day for the Sydney race carnival;
Guy Madden and his little wife, who now
threatens to outrun her husband in plump-
ness; Mrs. Jack Baillieu, who is convoying
niece Aimee Shackell to Sydney for the social
whirl; Mrs. Eric Harrison, in mauve drap-
ings ; the Rupert Downes pair; Keith Mur-
doch and Tommy Cochran —all were active
in the dance-arena.
The youthful Malcolm Maslin pair are
not dissembling their pride in their parental
dignity. The son is the first male Maslin
of his generation. His first outing was to
•see Auntie Peggie Mills, who is spending
six months in bed because of a bruised bone
in her spine. Later on he will be taken up
to the Maslin acreage in the Ma State, where
he will be reared among the gum-trees. The
infant is a great-grandson of the late Col.
Tom Price on the distaff side of the house.
The Zacutti dame was responsible for the
jazz evening which enlivened Austral Salon
circles the other night, when the crowd
whirled for the Japanese relief fund. The
interior of the Salon was a blaze of the
club colorings—blue and gold—but the blue
had been left out of the supper decorations.
Gertrude Summefhayes made herself re-
sponsible for the lilting one-step music. The
organiser, all black-velveted, brought daugh-
ter Alva, who was flounced in raven geor-
gette. Mrs. Quinnell beamed appreciation
above moonbeam effects on a black backing.
The Fordyce Wheeler pair have broad-
casted invitations for the marriage of daugh-
ter Brenda and William Bates at Toorak St.
John’s on November 1.
Here is a photo of Gwen Barringer, the
South Australian water-colorist whose recent
Melbourne show was frequently hidden
three-deep, and whose pictures in the Society
of Artists’ exhibition in Sydney got a pat
on the back from The Bulletin the other
day. Mrs. Bar-
ringer started
to draw at the
Adelaide
School of De-
sign, and after
becoming
thoroughly ac-
quainted with
a box of colors
worked for
some months
under Hans
Heysen. The
influe nee of
Heysen is vis-
ible in some of
her gutnscapes,
in which she
often reveals
the same lyric
enjoyment of a
perfect day;
but in the pre-
sentation of
studies of industrial energy she is asserting
herself in a new field and is producing
strangely thrilling symphonies of muscle and
iron. She has painted considerably in N. S.
Wales, but all her best out-door work has
been done in the Mount Lofty ranges, and,
later, on the Onkaparinga River, where her
husband has a snug nest.
The crowds and the weather smiled on
the Alfred Hospital fete in the hospital
grounds on Friday and Saturday, and £9OOO
is expected to rattle into the institution’s
money-box. The Irvine dame, in brown
tailorings and a blue-ribboned hat, spoke the
opening blessing, and later made a tour of
inspection under convoy of ex-Senator
George Fairbairn and hospital sec. Mac-
dougall. Every suburb did its bit for the
cause, and the ’Varsity meds. ran a jazz
palais. The flower sector, promoted by Mrs.
Ntorman Hamilton, of Brighton, was at-
tached to the Toorak effort, which included
the raffling of a linen-stocked cabinet. The
Barry Thompson and James Angus matrons
staged a gorgeously-dressed Egyptian revue
in the adjacent drill-room, under the direc-
tion of Albert Harris; and Dolly Castles
Finn, Dolly Stewart, Cecil Parkes, Mrs.
Ed. Dyson, Pat Dunlop, Norman Lee and
others provided pleasing song intervals.
A whole lot of tourists will regret the re-
c®Dt Passing at Cheltenham Benevolent Home
of Pat McVeigh, who probably knew more
concerning the mountainous country beyond
Warburton than any other living person. In
4 , < l t l ys of the Sold rushes to Wood’s Point
and Matlock he built a hotel about 20 miles
from n arburton on the track to Wood’s Point,
but for many years now it has catered mainly
tor tourists engaged in the walk from War-
burton to VValhalla. McVeigh retired from
business on the death of his wife a few years
ago, but continued to live in the locality.
This is how Langham’s camera saw Miss
Rosalie Virtue, a little bundle of nervous
force, physical energy and organising power,
who is the Education Department’s super-
visor ot physical training. Under her
guidance the
kiddies of 2000
schools exer-
cise and dance
their way to
health with no
thought of the
fact, so pain-
fully driven
home in the
o 1 d physical-
jerks system,
that they are
curing them-
selves of cur-
vature of the
spine or house-
maid’s knee.
During the
Prince’s visit
she ran the
big show on
t h e M.O.C.
ground, and
when Halsey
dragged him away to a bigwigs’ function,
Edward P. protested to the little organiser-
in-chief : “Oh ! I do want to stay with you
and see these jolly little kiddies go on with
their dancing.” And he meant it, too. Last
year she fixed up the training of the thou-
sands of girls for the big stunt at the great
Jubilee Exhibition. How she runs things
from the Murray to the sea is a mystery,
but she seems to get through with a laugh
and a wave of her capable little hand.
Mrs. Henry Rosenthal helped the Queen
Vic. Hospital appeal with an afternoon of
cards, tea and song in her roomy Toorak
reception parlors. It was a topping affair,
and the brightness of the musical fare pro-
vided by the J.C.W. firm almost made one
blink. George Kensington was in command
of the constellation in the drawing-room sec-
tor, and manager George Smith buzzed round
to see that all went well. Little Josie Mel-
ville sang a couple of “Sally” duets with
Herbert Browne; Hughie Steyne and Cecil
Bradley also gathered in whips of applause;
but chief musical honors were scored by
Neville Towne’s tenor. Later on the crowd
surged down the ballroom to hear Ada Reeve
in. a couple of numbers. The Norman
Brookes and Cleve Kidd matrons added to
the returns with a flower-laden kiosk in the
hall, while Mrs. McCallum Neil and Mrs.
Marriott were actively engaged in the raffle
section,; and there were squads of girl-helps
on duty at all angles. An attractive trio of
youthful Rosenthal daughters lent the
family butler and his underlings aid in pass-
ing the tebcakes. The eldest sister, Elva,
who is packing for a Colombo trip, radiated
in striped silk, bibbed with white net; Olive
was in sprigged muslin, and little Margot
fluttered like a buttercup in yellow. Their
mother draped her beautiful figure in silk of
Paisley colorings under a black picture hat
effectively backed with an immense blue
plume.
The name of the next Gaud Mayor will
have to be announced next week, but it
couldn’t be identified at the Agricultural
Show. It was concealed under an alias . If
you asked a knowing old alderman which
of his partners in gastronomy was going to
wear the chain of hoffis he would answer,
“Touchango” or “Hardtosay,” neither of
which is a proper name within the meaning
of the Act. Why these city fathers should
so furiously rage together (in secret) con-
cerning the election of a Gaud Mayor is sup-
posed to be a question with a knighthood
in it. One of the candidates is likely to be
so keen on getting the precious titular dis-
tinction that a terrible backstairs struggle
is inevitable. That accounts for betting on
the result.
Mabel Sharpe, whose capture by Chinese
bandits was reported a few days ago, is
well known in Melbourne and Sydney, where
she has many friends. She is a native <ot
Westralia, but went to China some years ago
with the C.1.M., and has been stationed in
various places, including the province of Ho-
Nan and Shanghai.
The Queen’s Hall sheltered the farewell
lecital of Dallas Fraser, the English girl
’celloist, who is returning to her homeland
after some musically active months in this
city. An interesting programme, with a
Yalentini sonata as its weightiest number,
showed the usual latter-day avoidance of
popular items. Miss Fraser, who has fine
interpretative intelligence and a facile tech
nique, plays with a pleasing sincerity which
clears the pitfalls of tricky effects; but her
music is lacking in the temperamental asser-
tiveness necessary to stir one’s emotions —un-
less one simply compels the stirring. In an
unaccompanied bracket of Bach trifles one
sensed an original strain which, if it finally
materialises, should carry Dallas Fraser to
the top. Rita Hope supplied a sympathetic
piano backing.
Dan White, founder of the Chamber of
Manufactures, handed in his checks at St.
Vincent’s Hospital last week. He was 27
when he arrived from Roscrea, Tipperary,
62 years ago. He worked as a journeyman for
seven years, and then, with a capital of a
couple of hundred, founded a coachbuilding
business in Swanston-street. He prospered,
but lost everything in the land-boom period.
Then Jimmy Moore, the timber-man, came
to the rescue, and Dan, like a burnt-out
settler, began afresh. He did very well, too,
and bubbled as genially as ever.
The Albert Miller widow has landed back
from a brief survey of America, where she
was joined by her daughter and grand-
daughter, Mrs. Alan Currie and Joyce Rus-
sell. They had been tripping in England,
and were among the Australians who bobbed
to Royalty at the Spring season Courts.
Che Russell damsel was to have stayed over-
sea for a time, but the illness of stepfather
George Blackwood brought her hurrying
back.
William Burrell, one of our finest accom-
panists, has been suffering from an injured
hand for some weeks, and is now tortured
by the fear of having his career marred by
the loss of a thumb. As he earns his crust as
an organist he will be faced with disaster
indeed if the surgeon’s knife has to be
called out.
Mrs. Harry Payne fed a big feminine
gathering on tea, cake and chatter
the other afternoon at her Toorak place,
where a big potted tree of white wistaria
provided the chief decorative triumph. Mrs.
Payne hostessed in dove-grey hangings, glad-
dened with beads, and daughter Ella’s smile
arose over cloudy blue, circled midway with
many colors. Everyone who is anyone was
there, of course.
A little gossip from Adelaide: —
Lady Bridges (his Ex.’s sister, Miss Philippa
Bridges, and Mr. Winser with her) turned up to
hear Prof. A. T. Strong lecture on “Beowulf” for
the Victoria League. Prof. Mitchell, from the

Helen Scott Young was married the other day to
Whitford, son of the C. H. AVinnalls, of North Adel-

discarded the orthodox white for primrose georgette

On Ballymena’s A.J.C. Derby, as on
Etivoli’s and Oupidon’s, a bookmaker game enough to
lay 5 to 1 the field a month before the race, and to
go on with the game till barrier-rise, would have
made a pot of money. The risk, such as it was,
would have been justified by the fact that rank out-
siders had triumphed three years running, and by
the knowledge that there would be a numerous field
of youngsters whose staying-power was doubtful, and
who, in their preliminary trials with the colors up, ex-
hibited baffling form. But there are no such bookmakers
lbout nowadays, For all the boosting he gets from
■redulous reporters, whose ears he fills with apocry-
phal yarns about the prodigious amounts he loses or
lands to lose, the Sydney metallic ian is as poor-
■pirited an odds-craniper as there is ini captivity.
Anyone wanting to back King Carnival or The Monk

When this pair lost

different performances,

orite at an equally false
price. And when the

ton it was 3 to 1

Mcßook won, of course
—he couldn’t help it—
but his profit would
have been far greater
had he departed from
his close-fisted custom
and offered the public
fair odds.
Ballymena’s success was worth £6320 to his
M.L. owner, H. J. Knight. The son of Nassau-
Medley is by no means first-class, but he had been
raced into capital condition —much better than that
of some of the other starters —aiid McCarten’s good
riding did the rest. This young man has no superior
among the Sydney horsemen, unless it is the
veteran Pike. In a rough, bumping race he &ku-
fully avoided the trouble which Shrapnel. Leonardo
and' Lady Valais struck in large quantities, and
landed his mount a winner by half-a-length from
Shrapnel, with heads between the pacemaking King
Carnjval and Lady Valais. Rahiri and Tarleton
had every chance, but failed to come on.
At Moorefield on September 22 licensed banditti
were offering 20’ to 1 The Hawk and Rapine for the
Epsom and Metrop. double. One a horse on the
small side (and none too sound at that) with Sst.
71b., the other a young four-year-old with 9st. 31b.,
and a big field to beat in each case. It was day-
light robbery, but such is the inevitable consequence
of the mad embargo on the publication of current
prices. A dav or two after Moorefield The Hawk de-
veloped a cold and shaped poorly on the track. His
price thereupon lengthened a bit, but on Saturday it
shortened to 5 to 1, Duke Isinglass being at >
Bardoleur at lO’s, Vodka and Claro at 12 s, and
Polytheist at 16’s. Badly placed early in the
proceedings, The Hawk finished a close fourth, and
pulled up a very distressed steed. Plainly he wasn t
himself. But, fit and well, he could never have
beaten Claro, as the race was run. In a previous
effort at Randwick the imported horse (he is by
Clarissimus-Harmonica) had shown exceptional speed
after being left at the post. Here, young Cracknell
got him away with the field, and he had the others
settled a furlong from home. Galloping the mile
in lmin. SSsec., he was two lengths to the good of
the Victorian three-year-old Quintus (alleged to be
a 100-to-l chance—he paid £8 7s. on the tote), and
another Victorian in Polytheist, with Oranian and
Bardoleur nearest to The Hawk. Claro is trained by
Williams, and owned by the party who races under
the name of “Wolseley,” and the stable landed a fair
stake.
The w.f.a. Spring Stakes disposed of Rapine’s pre-
tensions to favoritism for the Metrop., and inci-
dentally gave punters a trustworthy tip. David
(evens) got home handily from the beautifully-fit
Rivoli, with Purser a good third, Sir Andrew a
close and fast-finishing fourth, and Rapine next. On
this form Sir Andrew, with 81b. less than weight-for-
age, looked to have a great chance in the 13-fur-
longs race, more especially as the white-faced
chestnut was in perfect shape, but there was rather
more public money for David and Oranian, all three
being returned by the gentleman who collects the
s.p. quotations at 8 to 1. Barosca set a pace that
broke up the non-stayers and the animals which
hadn’t done a preparation, and at 10 furlongs, or
thereabouts, two-thirds of the field were hopelessly
licked. Not so the Victorian four-year-old. Given
his head approaching the home turn, as in the A.J.C'.
St. Leger, he led all the way up the straight, and
won by four lengths in the Australia n - record time of
2min. 43isec. David, finishing gallantly under his
big weight (9st. 131 b.), although the great old horse
had been galloped on, cut the outsider Comptroller
out of second money, and Wallace Mortlake, Oranian
(unlucky again), The Cypher and Rivoli were next.
Sir Andrew is owned and trained by James Wilson,
who bred him, and was thoroughly attuned for the
trying ordeal, whereas some of the Randwick-trained
horses were half-fit. He was ridden with excellent
judgment by Jones. # # #
If the Tullamarine Handicap, at Caulfield,
was regarded as a Cup test for Switch, the result
could hardly have gladdened the stable’s heart. Old
Paratoo, from Adelaide, had a lot the best of the
weights, to be sure, but the ancient battler beat
Switch quite easily. Caserta’s third was encouraging
to Caulfield Cup backers of stable-companion Whittier,
and the Woorak four-year-old showed that there was
nothing wrong with him by winning a six-furlong
sprint with his mouth open. Whittier has a large
following in Victoria, but Saturday’s meeting at
Flemington may reveal a possible conqueror, not to
mention the last day at Randwick.
“Head-Collarer”: “The Deacon” (B.
20/9/’23) brought a smile to my weather-worn phiz
by questioning my knowledge of pony-racing. i
saw the birth of the putrid business in N. S. Wales,
and did a bit of pony-flogging myself on the old
Driving Park, later the Agricultural Ground. One
of my contemporaries jumped his steed over three
fences and bolted out of the gate. There was a
writ waiting at the scale, with a deluded punter
or feed-merchant behind it. I was also present at
Botany when a mannikin, coming up the straight,
leant over and grabbed the favorite’s bridle, running
the astonished steed into a corrugated-iron fence.
And the games that used to be played at Lillie
Bridge ! In one case, pony and boy went flying over the
fence, as the result of a well-judged bump at the
turn; in another, a jockey left a trail of shot
round the track, and was disqualified for weighing-in
short —the shot-bag had been nicked to provide the
result. For a few months I acted as confidential
clerk to the trainer of a big string. Each cf his
ponies ran in a different name —a mug-puntcr's
generally—but the man who gave the “death-knock
chat’’ for the stable was an obese bookmaker. To-
day, in a lane behind a factory in a Sydney industrial
suburb, I saw two girls, one a bookmaker, the other
her clerk, making wagers with the factory-lizzies in
the lunch-hour. Instead, as “Deacon” suggests, of
having the little knowledge that is dangerous I
know too much about a game that is rotten through
and through.

Facing a boisterous north wind and clouds
of dust, H. Hayden, the N.S.W. veteran, put up a
wonderful performance in annexing the Victorian
Marathon in 2hr. 58min. lOsec., which beats W.
Murray’s previous Victorian record by 38see. All
the runners had a rough passage, and Hayden was
very groggy near the finish, but sheer pluck kept
him ahead of Parcell, the Queenslander, and Murphy
of Malvern (Vic.) Harriers, who were second and
third. Parcell led the procession for a considerable
distance, but weakened over the last bit. Murphy
ran strongly throughout.
Phil O’Shea has made a habit of register-
ing fastest time in the Timaru-Christchurch (-M.L.)
cycle race. He has done it on six occasions, but
it took him 6hr. 00 l-ssee. last month, as against
shr. 14min. 58sec. in 1913. However, the 34-year-
old Digger had to contend with a stiff wind. O’Shea
has won the race twice (in 1909 and 1913), and
filled fourth place four times. He has as good a
right as the next man to the title of Australasian
road champion, having recorded fastest time in the
Warrnambool-Melbourne race last year.
Knocked out by the Filipino Villon in the
fifth round of a hair-raising fight at Sydney Stadium,
Packy McFarlane, the Newcastle featherweight, had
to be taken to the hospital, and was still there at
the moment of writing. He is the second Newcastle
boxer to undergo this experience in the last few
months, the other being Jack Johnson; and Collins,
from the same town, has been disqualified and de-
prived of his share of the purse as a result of
inquiries concerning his meeting with Eagel, the
American. Luck and Newcastle pugdom have parted
company. » * *
“0.K.”: Clarence Weber’s return to the
wrestling mat was chiefly due to the discovery that
the physical-culture business which he started with
friend Rice, 20 yearn ago, was losing the advantage
of his previous notoriety. Melbourne had begun to
think of Clarence Weber as a light of other days,
a retired athlete whose pupils gave a demonstration
at Melbourne Town Hall once a year. That he was
really a better wrestler, and a finer figure of a
man, at 41 than when he abandoned the title in
1913 was known to hardly anybody outside his
school of muscle culture. Want of eombativeness
and lack of advertising spirit had been against
“Clarrie” from the start of his career. Old Mel-
bourne sports, who can look as far back as the time of
Professor Mi ler, have remarked on the little that
statuesque Weber has made of his strength, versatility
and appearance, as compared with what the huge,
ungainly champion strong-man of long-ago did in
keeping his name before the public. Clarence Weber
was a mild-mannered boy of 16 when he let himself
be inspired by his chum Jack Rice to take up physi-
cal culture .on Sandow lines. Rice was a wonder-
ful case of physical development in an originally
weak-framed man, and he saw the business possibili-
ties in his tall friend. In 1903 they started their
school, and late in the following year Rice urged
Weber to tackle Buttan Singh, who offered a prize
to anyone capable of living on the mat with him.
Weber being difficult to throw, Buttan throttled him
into submission. Then Hackenschmidt came to Aus-
tralia and gave Weber a few points, whilst express-
ing the opinion that he needed only a little “devil”
to make him unbeatable when he was fully matured.
However, he grew sufficiently aggressive to have his
revenge on Buttan Singh in 1906, when he was 24
years old. He was only required to defend the
title six times in the next seven years, for he in-
variably made pork and beans of his opponents.
Now he is prepared to take on all-comers again.
JOE WALLIS, Sydney Stadium referee.
“15-30”: The state of British tennis may
be gauged from the fact that in an international
match with Denmark the English team has been
beaten by four matches to one. Yet, there are
English tennis-writers who still counsel the youth
of the country to play the gentle baseline game
cultivated by the vicah and the curate when the late
Albert Edward was young. Four years ago in Sydney
we saw' members of an English Davis Cup team
producing a style of tennis that antedated that oi
the Dohertvs. There was Lowe, entrenched on the
back line and wound up to keep the ball bouncing
backwards and forwards for about 60 or 70 strokes
for every point. This exhausting business was
exemplified by Beamish, a graceful doubles player,
who also stuck to the baseline when his partner was
serving, and who was apparently quite uneducated
in the habit of standing up to the net to stop the
inevitable rain of sharp-angled returns. As for the
American tandem formation, in which a man guards
the net in a position on the same side of the court
from which his accomplice is serving—this is designed
to compel a sharp-angled backhander to return to
the server or shoot down the alley from an un-
comfortable position—-the English have apparently
novel - heard of it. It is strange, by the way, that
the orthodox experts) talk admiringly of the Dohertys,
though the two brothers shattered a long-established
tradition by playing brilliantly from every part of
the court.
» * * *
“J.H.” (London) : I don’t agree with
“Linesman” (B. 5/7/’23) that the English tennis
barracker is lacking in sportsmanship. Ihe alleged
bad form of “numerous well-dressed females in
“applauding Suzanne Lenglen’s errors” quite escaped
my notice during the fortnight I spent at W lmble-
don. Certainly, there was applause for hopelessly
outclassed players putting up a fight against the
incomparable French girl, but it was perfectly, natural
in the circumstances and not, a bit malicious. 1
have the best authority for thus writing—Suzanne
herself. . „
“Linesman”: Writing of the Australian
tennis-match with France, Schlesinger mentions that
Anderson beat Lacoste largely by running round to
hammer backhands off his forehand. This) discounts
the yarn that the Cornsalk had developed a reliable
backhand shot, and suggests that, if the young Frencn-
man had put sufficient pace into his backhand returns
to prevent Anderson taking them on his forehand,
the latter would have had a much rougher spin.
It is amazing to me that men of Anderson s calibre
are content to remain mere forehand fighters, ihis
weakness, which is almost frequent enough to be
national among Australian players, has lost I atter-
son numerous matches ; but I fancy the reason why
it gets so little attention in this country is that
there are few, if any, men brilliant enough to
expose it. Among our top-notcliers only O H'ira
Wood and Mclnnes are safe on the backhand, and
I count on the latter’s facility in this department
of the game to make him a deadly opponent in two
or three years’ time.
❖ * *
“0.K.”: The news that Wilfred Rhodes,
the old Yorkshire player, headed English bowling
averages for the season, brought tears to my eyes.
I seemed to hear again an early gramophone record,
dated Heaven knows when—“ Mr. C. B. Fry proposes
the toast of Cricket.” The speech was delivered in
a studied University accent, and was accompanied by
loud cheers at the right spots. It began with an
apologetic declaration that the toast might have been
proposed by a greatah cricketah, and there were
shouts of "denial. “Yes, gentlemen,” the speaker
proceeded, “there are many greatah, but I yield to
no man; no, nor to any woman —not even to my little
daughtah—in love of cricket. And when I say that
I mean not the cricket of Wilfred Rhodes and Victor
Trumpah, but the game universal. The game of
the village green, the Australian bush, the South
African veldt, and wherever the English language is
spoken. Gentlemen, I foresee the time when cricket
will be the bond of union among the nations; when
the only guns will be made by Moir and Gunn, and
the only cannon-balls be Wisden’s specials. Gentle-
men, I give vou Cricket —the bond of union, the basis
of understanding, the Game of Games!” A good man)
years after the putting of that record on the gramo-
phone, or whatever it was called at the time, the
World War came to pass. As regards the name of
Rhodes the speech is still up to date,
*** \ , *
“Machete”: “Percy Pawnticket” (B.
20/9/’23) can’t have played much cricket if he won-
ders why the cricketer doesn’t like going home in
his flannels after a game. In the Australian climate,
above all others, playing flannels are unpleasant wear-
ing after a hard afternoon’s running about. Even if
there is not a shower available, a change into dry
togs is a relief, apart from the danger of a chill
entailed by riding home in the cool of the evening
on a draughty tram, with wet clothes drying on one.
“Stellsby”: Tell “P. Pawnticket” that cricketers
get out of their flannels as soon as the match is
over because they would hate to be mistaken for ten-
nis knuts.
* * * *
Jack Gregory’s appearance in the Manly
XI is the most interesting feature of Sydney pre-
miership cricket. Against Mosman the big fellow
bagged 3 for 65, but the slow wicket took much of
the sting out of his bowling. With the bat he
made 39 before being run out.
* ir * *
S.A. Cricket Association now has 2100 full
members, and will not admit any more till further
accommodation is ready. It has bought five acres
of land out at Athelstone, to make sure of a supply
of the black soil of which the remarkably durable
Oval wickets are made. Ernest Jones, the old inter-
national express bowler, has been made a life mem-
ber ; so have the retiring committeemen, Harold
Fisher and Harry Blinman. The latter was a
great batsman in his time, perhaps the best who has
never got into a Test match. He ran Giffen and
Lyons hard in the old Norwood club ; but an appear-
ance for the Rest of Australia about 1885 was the
highest he ever got.
“J.H.” (London) : Features of the Eng-
land v. The Rest match at Lords were the bowling
of Maurice Tate, the abject failure of Hendren and
Mead, who have been doing wonders in county cricket,
and the appalling fielding of the English side—they
dropped 14 easy catches. Tate is a right-hand
medium-paced bowler of the Barnes type —“the man
we have been looking for,” say MacLaren and Warner.
F. T. Mann, picked as captain solely because of
Social qualifications, handled his side very badly.
Fender is obviously the man to captain England, but
he is not •persona grata to the M.C.C. mandarins.
Jack Hobbs is atilt a master; but his stamina is
going. Nowadays he tires easily.
“Wink”: I don’t want to take any credit
from Hendren’s feat of equalling the records of Fry
and Hayward, by scoring 13 centuries in a season
(B. 13/9/’23), but of C.B.’s total six (106, 209,
149, 105, 140 and 105) were made in consecutive
innings. In another season Fry- scored 135,
125, 229, 110, 96 and 105 in succession
for Sussex, and in between managed 68 and 72 for
the Gents, against the Players. C. H. Titchmarsh,
who phiyed so well when here with MacLaren’s
amateurs last season, is the only person who has
beaten 13 centuries in a season. In 1913 he made
21 hundreds for Hertfordshire, which is, however, only
a second-class county. W. G. Grace is still un-
approached as a run-getter. During his career he
made 217 centuries, 126 in first-class cricket. On
several occasions he hit a thousand runs in a month.
In 1896, when 47, he took up his bat for the first
time on the 9th of May, and by the 31st had compiled
1000 in first-class matches.
There were 55,660 people at the second
League semi-final, between Essendon and South Mel-
bourne, and it was a fine contrast to the first.
Neither side had much to swear by till near the
end, but the rcd-and-whites lasted the better and
collected 74 points to ’Don’s 57. Stockdaie added
twio goals to his season’s tally and now equals the
66 record of Dick Lee and Jim Freake; and he
still has one game to play. In the second Footscray-
Port Melbourne war, ’Scray got on top early and
gained the pennant, despite some fearsome rallies by
Port towards the close: ’Scray 52, Port 38. Trainers
and ambulance men were kept busy throughout, and
twice the Law had to threaten arrest for common
assault.
“Tickle”: Though there are not nearly
enough houses to-go round in Melbourne, Jim Walsh
could have his wish in any suburb and on his own
terms. He is just now the most-soiight-after foot-
baller in Victoria, for with Yarraville, the first-grade
junior team he captains, he has kicked 133 goals,
which easily beats Dave McNamara’s 107 for Essen-
don Association in 1912. Against Prahran’s second
XVIII Walsh got 23 goals, and. against Carnegie
he booted 20. Yarraville have supplied the League
with many champions, among them Andy McDonald
and O’Brien of Carlton, Tandy of South, and Farrell
and Campbell of Essendon. v
“Riverina”: M.L. football followers are
grinning over an action of Southland's dour Rugby
Union executive in Invercargill. It has hitherto been
the custom to take visiting rep. teams to the Bluff and
regale them with Stewart Island oysters. But a
football-writer who had forecasted a triumphant tour
for the N.S.W. team sourly ascribed the Blues’ heavy
defeat by Southland (31 to 9) to overfeeding in
Bluff bivalve-joints. Thereupon the executive met
in solemn conclave and decided that in future oysters
would be off the menu. “They’ve cut out the chief
inducement to travel south!” growled an All Black
up north.
The September floods played strange tricks
with sport in Adelaide. The Oval was literally
under water on the morning of a semi-final footbail
match ; but fire-brigade pumps were used on it, and
it cleaned up quite respectably for the afternoon.
At the Port rifle-ranges, targets were blown down,
and ‘ adjournments required. Holliday, of S.A., lead-
ing in the competition for the King’s, required only
42 to win at the final distance, 900 yards, and looked
a good thing; then the storm got hold of him. and
he scored 3. So the winner was W. W. Harris, of
the Post and Telegraph Club in Melbourne, a war
veteran who manages to attend all important shoots.
POSSIBLY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“It was a busy day in the ring, and possibly the
fielders had something to the good when thoughts
were turned homewards.” — S. M. Herald. (Two of
the winners started at 20’s, two at 12’s and two
at 10’s.)
A busy day! It was, so help me bob 1
The'wild w’ind blew and blustered round the course.
The punters, a voracious, seething mob,
Assailed the ring in overwhelming force.
Take it from me, ours is no weakling’s job.
With yelling odds my throat is strained and hoarse
And choked with dust. But, between me and you,
It’s possible I’ve earned a bob or two.
I may have made a trifle, and I trust
I have, although I can’t be certain yet
Till wins and losses I have time t’ adjust
And my accounts in black and white to set.
A chap who has to battle for a crust
Through seven solid hours of shout and sweat
Can never tell for certain how things go.
The bag seems heavier, but you never know.
No red-hot favorite triumphed, that’s a fact,
To make us ringmen grit our teeth and damn,
But nothing either cantered home unbacked
To help hard-working bookies skin the lamb.
They had some friends at 20’s, Cataract
And Golden Crock. Lucerne and Oriflamme
Started at 12’s. At 10’s Peruke and Paul
Went lout. And don’t forget we laid them all.
Tipsters, ’tis true, were seldom more at fault
Or public form more hopelessly astray.
Still, tales of punters’ losses should with salt
Be taken. All that you can safely say
Is that from noon to eve without a halt
We’ve borne the heat and burden of the day
And there’s —no cert, but just a likelihood
We’re heading homewards something to the good.

“Ex-Dig.”: Tilney, the returned soldiers'
rep. on the Repatriation Commission, is a
Sydney man. Before the war he was in the
head office of the Telegraph Department.
General McGlynn, now superintendent, was
there also. Deputy-Commissioner Barrett,
now in Sydney, was a grocer in Port Pirie
(S.A.), and the D.C. of another department,
was a cook.
Gone where the good commercials go, Fred
Milsom, secretary of the Tas. C.T.A. since
he gathered a number of bagmen together at
the Launceston Hotel 23 years ago and saw
the association launched. At first lie did
the job honorarily, but when the Commer-
cial Travellers’ Club was opened and the
association blossomed into a big body, he
dropped his wholesale agencies and became
paid secretary. He was 60 at the end.
Pemberton Billing, who used to get his
name in the cables more often than most lay
politicians when he was a member of the
House of Commons, threw in the political
towel in 1921, and returned to engineering.
The immediate result has been a number of
patents in regard to gramophones—one is a
record that can be folded up and carried in
the pocket. The inventor has secured back-
ing, and he proposes to come and make his
goods in Melbourne.
“Bill Bowyang”: The train from Bowen
to Proserpine (N.Q.) was held up through
a novel cause one day recently. The contrac-
tor brought the mails from the post-office to
the railway-station and stacked them on the
platform before the mail truck. Soon after-
wards a goat happened along and devoured all
the labels. When the damage was noticed
the postal staff were aroused from their slum-
bers to _ open the bags and ascertain their
destination. The train didn’t get away till
an hour after time.
A recent jury at Richmond (Eng.) found
that the deceased committed suicide through
worry over inability to pay his income-tax,
and the Coroner remarked that that had
become quite a recognised cause, ranking
alongside drink and religion. One insidious
peculiarity of the income-tax ns that it isn’t
levied on what a man has, but on what lie
had last year. Another is that, in a busi-
ness of big profits and big losses, the tax,
over a series of years, may easily be more
than the income. It seems curious, but it
happened to more than one Australian pas-
toralist in the late exciting times.
“Hamer” : Recently I had occasion to make
inquiries concerning three families whose im-
mediate founders were all settled on the land.
The result was startling. The children num-
ber 12, 11 and 9; and of the 32, 19 were
boys. All were born and bred in the coun-
try. Two of the 19 I found had become
policemen, three tram employees, one a “com-
mission agent,” four shop-assistants or sales-
men, two small storekeepers, one a horse-
trainer, three laborers, one a caretaker and
two. Harbor Trust workers. There wasn’t
a single farmer or farm-worker among the
lot; and only one of the daughters had mar-
ried a farmer. What is perhaps as notable,
these children of large families have gone
out of that business, too. Between the lot
of them they have only 41 children, and the
largest family is three.
“Centurion” : “W.H.R.H.’s” remarks about
the increase of Capetown’s colored popula-
tion (B. 18/9/’23) sets me thinking of the
old port’s curious Malay quarter. . The
Malays were originally introduced by early
Dutch _ settlers, and, pegging out, a quarter
of their own, gradually became a big unit
in the population. The women, who are
good-looking until they begin to run
to flesh, which is almost always early,
keep to the Malay costume, and the
community generally has a reputation
for good behavior. Queerly enough, the
Malays used to monopolise the fish-
ing and cab-driving industries, two that
are seldom associated. By all accounts
they still combine the two trades, although
the hansom-cabs of other days have given
place to taxis. Strict Mohammedans, there
has been little intermarriage with the white
or the Hubshi, and they remain a people
apart.
“Wessel”: Proposals for the systematic
use of aeroplanes for exploration work in
Australia are said to be viewed favorably by
Colonel Brinsmead, director of civil aviation
Professor Gregory once remarked that we
have better maps of the moon than of parts
of Australia. With ’planes it ought to be
possible to make a rapid survey of large
areas. Plying conditions are good over much
of inner Australia, and there are usually fair
landing facilities. Hitherto, explorers even
when equipped with camels, have usually
spent most.of their time hunting for water.
The job should be much easier if done from
tlie air; and in view of the miracles performed
by ’planes in carrying water in the deserts
between Egypt and Palestine during the war
it should be quite feasible to bring supplies
by plane when a particularly arid bit of
country seems worthy of closer examination.
Aircraft, too, would make it a lot safer to
examine country where the abos. are hostile
t£ eac herous. The auriferous region south
ot Tanami (N.T.) is one tract which has
been very little prospected owing to this rea-
son, combined with its remoteness and desert
character.
T. 0.1.” about some pioneering:—
John Medwin Black, financed by Captain Robert
Towns of Sydney, was the discoverer of the Ross River
(y 0» mentioned by “Cobba Cobba” (B. 30/8/’23).
That would be in 1862. Black, when in Melbourne
preparing to return to -Cleveland Bay, looked up an
old friend named Ross to go with him. The latter
was employed, as manager I think, by Spiers and
Rond, at the Piazza, the refreshment bars in front of
the old Princess’s Theatre in Spring-street. George
Fawcett, then lessee of the Princess’s, begged to be
allowed to accompany the little party, and he, Black
and Ross remained in Queensland. They built the
first house for Capt. Towns, and named the place
Townsville. Fawcett—who had three brothers, George,
Tom and Sanford, actors like himself—in after
years became the oyster merchant of the town. The
late W. H. Ford, with a concert co. on the way to
Ravenswood diggings, found him and his wife camped
on the shores of the bay, where later he left his
bones. The river (or creek) was named after Ross.
The object of Capt. Towns in sending Medwin
Black to Cleveland Bay was to find a port of
communication with large squatting propertied which
he held up that way. He had cotton in his eye
at the same time.

♦
“Mis’ Nell o’ New Orleans,” third of the
Vanbrugk-Boucicault production?, at Mel-
bourne King’s, comes within the category of
j American trick plays. Written for the iead-
| ing lady, it leaves her to explain at the finish
that everything of importance which has
just happened was arranged by herself be-
forehand. To use her own conventional
Amei-icanism, she had “stacked the cards.”
A variant of Aunt Ellen in *The White-
haired Boy,” the lady has returned to pic-
turesque New Orleans after 30 years or so
of life in Baris, with the intention of play-
ing all-pervading heroine in a domestic
drama entitled “The Spoof, the Fake and the
Fiction.” That is not how Nellie Daventry
explains the situation, but it will pass. The
victims and accomplices of her whim are
Georges Durand, a peppery Creole gentleman
who hiis married and lost his wife since lie
loved lively Nellie in her pre-Fanisian days;
white-haired Bere Clement, who also adored
the lady at the time, and gave her fianed
(Georges) justifiable cause for suspicion;
Felix, the adult son of Georges aforesaid;
and Delphine Falaise, an adopted relation of
Nellie’s. Other characters are a pair of tire-
some niggah servants, and a wholly uncon-
vincing young woman, first presented to the
audience as an immoral person in pink, but
eventually revealed as Mis’ Nell’s confiden-
tial maid and accomplice. Unseen aiders
and abettors in the leading lady’s “frame-up”
are sentimental glee-singers and a tenor
i serenader, who repeat certain melodies heard
30 years earlier in the same garden under
circumstances Mis’ Nell desires to recall bo
her old sweetheart’s mind. The volatile lady,
it will be observed, stage-managed the whole
dam’ show. The sinful word is permissible
m this place because it is one she freely
uses for laugh-raising purposes.
It goes without saying that Miss Van-
brugh is a huge success in her fine fat part.
Even the hardness of her voice and style are
suited by it. Her quizzical humor is entertain-
ing, her frequent lapses into mock heroics—
well, no actress of her finish and polish could
be other than brilliantly successful in such
easy work. Only when she descends to
MELBOURNE TIVOLI.
Enter Herschel Henlere, the Paderewski
of vaudeville.
ultra-sentimentality is the effort in her act-
ing strikingly obvious. The play gives her
many reminiscent situations. When Irene
Vanbrugh displays herself in her gown of 30
years earlier you get whiffs of “Smilin’
Through.” Her matrimonial position at
the finish is that of “Lady Frederick,” and
when she and the boy she has bewitched re-
turn, dead beaten, from futile journeyings
in quest of a parson, you have the picture
over again of Madge Elliott and her young
man in “A Night Out.” Then do you ask
yourself whether many of these amusing but
utterly theatrical “straight” comedies might
r>bt as well be musical, spectacular and
'/erpsichorean V Dion Boucicault’s study of
the kindly priest is good work, though often
his part is reduced to piffle. Hallard, as
Georges Durand, gives an excellent interpre-
tation of the courteous, choleric Creole gen-
tleman, required to retain a measure of
respect despite misrepresentation through-
out two acts. Martin Walker does pretty
well in the not-easy part of ybung-man
Felix. Janet Eccles, handicapped by a
weak speaking voice, makes a capital start
as Delphine, but afterwards the plot treats
her cruelly, and she fades into futility. A
picturesque setting of an old garden in New
Orleans suffices for the three acts of this
likeable entertainment.
s:; »!: * *
Melbourne has been sentenced to a fort-
night of “Katinka,” at Her Majesty’s, with
Gladys Moncrieff in the part which she ex-
pressed more tenderly in 1918. Frankly,
Gladys’s besetting buxomness makes one cling
more to the memory of her
earlier self. Also her singing is only mod-
erately beautiful, and occasionally seems
tired in the upper register. Cecil Bradley
is another who is rather short and plump
for active service as Mrs. Hopper, in which
character the late Florence Young was
so bright. Claude Flemming, as the Grand
Duke, who formerly preoccupied John Ral-
ston, appears to have a disposition to melan-
choly, probably produced by the cut of his
Russian whiskers. Reg Roberts doesn’t
sound like a fugitive from a heavenly choir
in voicing his heartbreaks to the l’obust
heroine; Leslie Holland has Knopf perfectly
ironed and creased, while keeping him within
the bounds of probability; and Stigant is the
alleged American millionaire who tries to
be gay on a mere pittance of personality.
However, the main feature of the show is
the lack of youth and freshness in the cast:
the array of such matured principals as
Flemming, Stigant, Roberts and Holland,
not to mention the patriarchal John Forde,
suggests some sort of commemorative re-
union.
* * * *
Allan Wilkie commenced the third week
of his Melbourne season on Saturday, with
another demonstration of imbecile jealousy
as the fat-headed Leontes of “The Winter’s
Tale.” There are no soft effects in the
actor’s orgy of accusation, but when the
Delphic oracle pronounces emphatically in
favor of his Queen, his voice gets as near
to tenor in its sorrow as a massive bari-
tone can. Here Wilkie is weakest, because
his contrition sounds falsetto, whereas he
scores in the baser moods because his natural
tone is fitted for the expression of raucous
hates. The tragedian has hardly done any-
thing better than in Leontes’ first spasm,
when coarse suspicion is gnawing his vitals.
More, than ever Frediswyde Hunter-Watts
exercises her doleful sweetness as Hermione
and later as Berdita. The consequence is
such a conception of beautiful speech, aug-
menting the illusion of impregnable chastity,
that the scandal of Leontes’ charges becomes
all the more dumbfounding. Leslie Man-
nei-s keeps a stiff back as Bolixenes, but there
is an occasional blissful note in his diction,
suggesting how iute-like it would grow in the
r6le of Romeo. Lorna Forbes, as Baulina,
earns approval for speaking out in a straight,
forthright manner at Leontes; and the infant
Bhyllis Scully is a pleasure as Mamillius.
Rr.zetakers among the horde of sundries are
Norman Lee and Vincent Scully for their
noble calves, and Blumpton Wilson for his
picture of Berdita’s alleged father. During
the current week Wilkie is repeating his Shy-
lock for three performances, and on Saturday
hurries back into history as King John.
At Melbourne Royal the popularity of
“Sally” is attested by two matinees a week,
and the poor orphling continues to learn to
dance the fandango in an asylum.

The reckless irresponsibility of “Rockets,”
at Melbourne Balace, will be discontinued on
Friday. Next nivht the co., with others,
will break out at the Brincess’s in “Bretty
Beggy,” which title, The Bulletin fancies,
was once associated with a comedy in which
the late George Musgrove starred Nellie
Stewart at the same theatre. But Hugh
Ward’s production of “Bretty Beggy” will
be a musical show, with Charles Austin and
the Bounds sistern as bill-toppers.
* * * s:
A phenomenon who refuses to play stiff
in a baseball game is the hero of “Trifling
with Honor,” at Hoyt’s, Melbourne, this
week. The rich girl who finds in poverty
the salvation which brings her to prosperity
and the Wedding March is exposed in her
invincible purity in “A Daughter of
Luxury.” Hoyt’s also have Bebe Daniels
playing an orphan as a duplicate of Little
Bright Eyes in a bathetic subject, “Nancy
from Nowhere.” Majestic supporters are
buying a look at “Only a Shopgii'l,” who, of
course, has an incredible capacity for sacri-
fice as well as a Best Boy and a Heart of
Gold. This film, however, is not so dis-
appointing as “The Fourth Musketeer,”
wherein a wife takes the right turning when
on the verge of a lush moment with a hand-
some devil. At the Britannia “The Wall
Flower” shows how the left-over can take a
first prize in the Matrimonial Stakes. It
is a tense week at the Melba. “Flames of
Bassion” is peeling the paint off the walls.

At Sydney Criterion the gale of mirth
is still blowing with boisterous velocity while

Nearly all of “The O’Brien Girl,” at
Sydney Opera House, is simple and
unambitious, wherefore the absence of
a first-class singer is not felt to any
distressing extent. Mamie Watson, the
leading lady, is a tall, slender blonde, with
beautiful eyes and hair, and an accomplished
actress withal. Sydney has abjectly sur-
rendered to her charm. June Roberts and
her sister Dorothy are slick dancers, and the
willy-willy branch of their art has two vigor-
ous exponents in Hazel Harris and Westley
Bierce. The humorous stuff is in eminently
capable hands —those of May Beatty, who
gets round, with astonishing agility consider-
ing that she has entered the heavyweight
class, and Mark Daly, whose methods are
quiet and all the more effective on that
account. Others who help are Ena Dale, a
sopi’ano; Ley land Hodgson, a baritone:
A lick Mcßherson and Lou Vernon, two old
friends; and Ireland Cutter, who does a
silly-ass part, is recommended to mercy on
the ground that he didn’t write the plav.
Lastly (and perhaps this last should have
been first), the girls of the chorus and ballet
do consistently good work.
Quarantine,” with the ’board-skip elope-
ment that is so dexterously frustrated and
the honeymoon that isn’t one, will remain
among the pleasantest memories that Law-
rence Grossmith leaves behind him when he
goes. The play has real Wit and humor to
carry it along, and there are some delightful
minor characters on the Angostura’s passen-
ger list.

There is nothing new to chronicle about
‘The Cabaret Girl,” at Her Majesty’s, Syd-
ney, except that her vivacity is as exuberant
as ever, and her gladsomeness shows no sign

Sydney Tivoli artists had a tough pro-

Colin Colahan goes to the Baris art-shows:
Art in Paris is in the most extraordinary con-
dition. The Artistes Prangais and the National are
in about the same condition as the Royal Academy—
inept. But then there is the other crew—the Autumn
Salon, the newly-formed Salon des Tuileries, and,
lastly, the Independents. This lot seem to have
realised the inefficiency of the Academic crew, but
have simply replaced academic inefficiency by reck-

lessness and extravagance. The Independents and
the wilder ones of the Autumn have attained the
limit of grotesqueness. Meanwhile Paris, scared out
of its life of repeating the blunders it made over
Manet and Corot, accepts it all with puzzled toler-
ance-shrugs its shoulders and says “One never
knows!”

"Fax”: G. 11. Mulcaster completed his
term in and turned his back on Australia
last week, and Bellamy, of the “Bulldog
Drummond” co., was his fellow-passenger.
Mulcaster leaves behind him the memory of
one of the few really haunting scenes one
gets in drama. Nobody who had the pleasure
of seeing the man in “A Faithful Heart”
could help being impressed by his rich speak-
ing tones and air of restrained emotion when,
after holding the house dead silent for about
half a minute, he looked at his young daugh-
ter, and asked, “Blackie, do you know who I
am?” The situation was purest melodrama
—and simple realism. Given a first-rate
actor, as Mulcaster was, in the part of a
self-respecting citizen confronted by a daugh-
ter whose existence had just come as a sur-
prise to him, and the scene must be thrilling.
“Baskerville”: The Firm has temporarily
abandoned the idea of remodelling Melbourne
Majesty’s. It was thought that the place
wouldn’t be ready for the threatening panto,
season, which will be followed soon after
by the Melba Opera Co. It w r as an easy
matter for Hugh Ward to convert the Palace
and Princess’s, since these playhouses were
not earning their keep when lie took them
over, and he was, therefore, not concerned
with the prospect of a huge loss of revenue
during the weeks of alteration. The posi-
tion is different with Her Majesty’s. That
has always been a popular house, and, on
account of its size, is one of the principal
links in the chain for the touring musical
shows. When it drops out of commission,
as it inevitably will next year, J. C. W..
Ltd., will have to do some hard thinking to
keep its usual companies on the road with-
out clashing. One can’t blame the Firm for
pondering lengthily over the problem which
closure would entail.
“Plasmon”: The daily press, which is
always ready to descant in its leading
columns on the power and glory of Shaks-
peare, is generally most perfunctory in its
attentions to Allan Wilkie. Condemned to
appear in obscure theatres, Wilkie can never
hope for the presence of the star critic if a
fashionable premiere of a tenth-rate revue is
happening elsewhere. Even when there is
no competing attraction, the absence of
the great man is obvious enough to be noticed.
It is Wilkie’s ludicrous fate to be “criticised”
by tired understudies, who regard the job as
an ordinary bit of reporting, and turn out
a par. full of empty cliches —so negligible
as a piece of criticism that it is lucky to
escape being huddled up among picture-show
boosts. This neglect, of course, is not due
to any disregard for divine William. It is
wholly inspired by the unimportance io.fi
Wilkie. If that earnest Scot only changed
his name to Ward or Tait, and hugely adver-
tised a lavish performance of, say, “Cymbe-
line,” at one of the big metropolitan theatres,
the Hazlitts of the dailies would turn into
their dress-clothes and rush to the show, con-
sumed with the momentousness of the occa-
sion.
“Norbell” : Some recently-imported vaude-
ville turns that have failed to click in Aus-
tralia remind me that Harry Rickards was
the daddy of all our vaudeville entrepreneurs.
He was that unusual theatrical bird, the slick
performer with a nice judgment of the draw-
ing powers of the other fellow. He was not
infallible, but he made few mistakes. This
knack of picking stage-winners cannot be
learnt. It is innate. ’Arry began life
“bound” to a firm of engineers at Bow, but
did not finish his apprenticeship, and soon
drifted to the ’alls. His first appearance was
at Wilton’s Music Hall when he was only
16. Not long after that he got an engage-
ment with Charles Morton, “the G.O.iVi. of
the variety stage,” his first big hit being
“Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines.” He
was nicknatned “Captain Jinks” in those
far-off days.
“Wilfrido”: Fryn Tennyson Jesse, the
author of “Quarantine,” is of Cornish ex-
traction and a great-niece of Alfred Tenny-
son. Her husband, Captain Harwqqd; is
connected with the stage, but she is better
known as a poet and a novelist than as a
playwright. Her “Happy Bride,” a book
of poems, was published in 1920, and her
powerful novel, “Secret Bread,” had, I re-
member, a glowing review on the Red Page.
“Fly-man” : “Renquillian” (B. 20/9/’23)
on actors and politics recalls that Billy
Hughes once did a bit of supering with
George Rignold. It is alleged that that is
where he learned “blue, blithering blazes.”
Jack Storey’s early ambition was to be ah
actor-r; a daughter inherited the taste and
has appeared. Gunn, S.A. Labor leader, is
more than a fair amateur. “Jim” Dooley
learned from Walter Bentley how to eloeute
and pose long before politics knew him.
A slight impediment in his breathing stopped
him. Holman, of course, is an actor and
the son of a. finished actor. Sir William
Don, I think, is the only' actor who ever left
our stage definitely for Parliament. Walter
Bentley, as Walter Begg, once contested Car-
narvon (Q.), but failed.'
From the Cockneys’ I’.P.: —
Among- new plays promised for early production
is ‘‘Blinkers,’’ which has a journalist for a hero.
The newspaper man is to be impersonated by George
Tully, whom Australia knows as a very capable
actor, and the leading lady is to be Elizabeth Irving,
daughter of the late H. B. Lizzie is a distinctly
promising Miss of 19. She has scored in several
Shakspearean r6les; and made a hit in “Olivia,”
M . G. Wills’s stage version of, Goldsmith’s “Vicar
of Wakefield,” brilliantly produced for an earlier
generation by. her grandfather at the Lyceum 58
years ago.
Charles Hawtrey’s death didn’t stop the run of
“Send for Dr. O’Grady,” at the Criterion. Hawtrey’s
part is being admirably played by Clarence Blakiston,
who appeared with Nellie'Stewart in “Sweet Nell”
and other Australian productions. It is Clarence’s
first big London part, and he is rising 60.
After starting somewhat shakily, and without bene-
dictions from the critics, “Bluebeard’s Eighth Wife,”
at the Queen’s, has settled down into an established
Success, having 400 performances 'to- its credit.
Norman McKinnel has mostly been the John Brown
of the production, though Godfrey Tearle took his
place for a time. Madge Titheradge has been
Momfe throughout.
“Renquillian”: “Second Murderer” (B.
2G/9/’23) and “Jacky Roo” (B. 13/9/’23)
need not jump on male choristers so hard.
Consider male solo-singers, especially con-
cert and operatic leads. How many of them
know what to* do with their hands? On a
concert platform a sheet of music often pro-
vides a life-line, and even then some wring
MOST UNPROFESSIONAL.
THE ARTISTIC ONE: “I only want the pass-
age-way scrubbed, Mrs. Mogys, so I
wish you would be careful anti not spill

THE ARTISTIC ONE : “Yes, but you'll leave a
nasty clean spot."
it as a laundress would a piece of
washing; others swap it from hand to hand
or grab it as if it were an unwelcome bill.
On the lyric stage, in the hands of many
male leads, a sword, a sceptre or a tennis-
racquet is very seldom carried as it should
be. Henry Bracey and Wallace Brownlow
are two pleasant memories of ho\y the thing
ought to be done. I remember one star for
whom Props, devised a “kicking-strap” a
black-silk bridle from the top of his hessian
boot to his scabbard, to keep it from “sprag-
ging” him. Yes, the voices we are producing
are good; but the acting! That is why
dances and dresses and scenery ad lib. have
to be requisitioned.
THE COMIC-MAN.
“Don't you think he's funny?"
“No, I can't take him seriously."
“ J. 8.”: “Namoi” (B. 13/9/’23) doubts
whether Nellie Stewart appeared in the
“Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star” panto, of
1873 at Melbourne Royal. I am not sure if
Nellie played in that production, although I
saw one performance of it, but she did
appear, with sisters Docy and Maggie, the
previous year (’72) in “Riquet with the
Tuft,” the first panto, produced at the Royal.
Djqcy and "Maggie were cast as two of the
rival princes, and Nellie as one of a bevy
of Silver Champions. J. R. Greville was Old
Mother Shipton, and Jenny Bryce Mother
Bunch; Dick.- Stewart and the Leopold
brothers were also in the cast. Nellie had a
part in Robertson’s “Society,” which imme-
diately preceded the panto. I do mot know
if this was her first appearance on any
stage, but it was certainly mine in a theatre
audience.
“Caisar’s Ghost”: Although not generally
credited with literary ability, John Cosgrove
has written (and sold) more pitcher scen-
arios than any other man in Sydney. May-
be it is evidence that he has no literary abil-
ityanyhow, Cosgrove began writing picture
stories when Spencer was turning out Aus-
tralian photo-plays, and has never been cured
of the habit. One of his plots is being
filmed now.
“J.F.H.” (Lond.) : Misguided efforts are
being made to induce Lillie Langtry to re-
turn to the theatre. Nearly a half-century
has passed since she became the reigning
beauty of London, a pedestal now occupied
by Gladys Cooper. In 1881 the Bancrofts
persuaded her to go on the stage, and next
year she organised a company of her oWn.
playing Lady Teazle, Rosalind, and Kate
Hardenstle (in “She Stoops to Conquer”).
She was never above the amateur standard,
but the public swarmed to the Haymarket
and the Imperial to gaze at her fine figure
and features, and gossip about her friend-
ship with the then Prince of Wales. I re-
member seeing two comedians at this period
at the Paviliori, Piccadilly Circus. In the
course of some knockabout business, one o?
them, got up as a Iydy. fell on the boards.
That was the cue for the ruffian to shriek,
“Go and tell the Prince of Wales Lillie Lang-
try is on the floor.” Those howls of Cockney
mirth haunt me still. It is Marie Lohr’s
husband, Anthony Prinsep —he is joint-man-
ager of the Globe —who is trying to beguile
the dame, now a septuagenarian, back to the
footlights. The play selected for her is
Somerset Maugham’s “Our Betters.” Lillie
declares that she is undecided about the
Prinsep offer, which doubtless means that
she wants to accept it.
“Phiz”: It might appear from a refer-
ence to Ellis Irving in the Sundry Shows
notice of “King Lear” at Melbourne Play-
house (B. 20/9/’23) that the young man
had borrowed the name for professional pur-
poses. As a matter of fact, Irving is his real
name, and he is very proud of it.
“0.K.”: An item of theatrical news con-
cerns James Quin who, as a Melbourne
Gallery student, won a travelling scholar-
ship long, long ago. When Robert Court-
neidge was here with the Gaiety Burlesque
Co., imported by George Musgrove, he be-
came friendly with -young Quin. The
scholarship-winner was about to go to Paris
to study. A couple of years later the actor
renewed his acquaintance with the painter
in the Parisian Bohemia, and only lately
they met again in London. Courtneidge is at
work with Thompson, the “Arcadians” libret-
tist, on a dramatic version of Henry Mur-
ger’s “La V’ie de Boh&me” ; and Quin has been
asked to devise the costumes and designs for
scenery. The drama will happen next year.
“Second Murderer”: When O. P. Heggic
was a young man playing the Messenger in
“A Message from Mars,” he wasn’t so hyper-
sensitive as "Columbine” (B. 27/9/’23) found
him. One night, at the end of Act 2, where
the Messenger bids the world good-bye ami
sails off for his own planet, the hoisting
apparatus got jambed when Heggie was our
of sight of the audience. Up the
hanging “cloths” and rows of electric “bor-
ders” he dangled precariously at the end of
a piano-wire. It took 15 minutes to get
him down, and then he wasn’t nearly so
perturbed as the mechanist.
Burst of enthusiasm from Auckland :
The Bulletin’s Melbourne critic has remarked
on May Beatty’s clear-cut diction and other admir-
able attributes of her art. The explanation is that,
unlike the tired damsel of present-day musical
comedy, May was trained in a school that worked.
Joining Tom Pollard’s Opera Co. as a kid of 8
or 9, she grew up in the company, which, 20
years and more ago, toured the length and breadth
of M.L. It would drop in at the Thames and pul
on 10 operas in a fortnight, then move on to Auck-
land for a month, playing 15 pieces in that period;
after which it would ramble round one-night villages
with a different show nearly every night. Tom
must have had 50 plays in his repertoire, and in
many of them Miss Beatty had to learn, not one
part only, but two or three. It made for versatility;
it entailed hard work. I have myself seen her play
tho title-role in “Olivette,” “Madame Favart,”
“Fallen,” “Belle of New York,” “La Perichole,”
“La PoupOe,” “Maritana,” “Patience,” and “Bohe-
mian Girl” ; as well as Stella and -Griolet in “Tam-
bour Major” ; Cliopinette, Yvonne and Paul in “Paul
Jones”; Bettina and Frittilini in “Mascotte”;
Buttercup and Josephine in “Pinafore”; Casilda,
Gianetta and Tessa in “Gondoliers” ; Germaine and
Serpolette in “Les Cloches de Corneville”; Molly
Seamore and 0 Mimosa San in “Geisha” ; Kitty
and Clanside in “In Town” ; Fifi in “Chinese
Honeymoon,” lead in “Fortune Teller,” “Daughter
of the Regiment” and “Fra Diavolo”; several
panto parts; and Topsy in “Uncle Tom’s Cabin.”
And that by no means completes the list. I never
once saw her loaf on the job. Whether it was
a small part or a lead, grand opera or low’
comedy’, Miss Beatty always played it for all that
was in it. And everyone in the theatre knew what
she said and sang. A royal welcome awaits her in
her native land if “The O’Brien Girl” ever gets away
from Australia.
“Thersites”: To be King Lear entails a
tremendous physical strain. When I went
round to see Allan Wilkie in the interval, I
found his abundant white whiskers sagging,
and the actor underneath them gasping—
nearly all out, in fact. Just then Clyde
Meynell, of “The Firm,” blew in. Noticing
Wilkie’s exhaustion, he remarked breezily:
“Chatty old chap, Lear, isn’t he?” Even
the dresser smiled.
“Nella”: The fact that “Katinka,” with
its “Rackety-coo,” “Skidikiscatch” and .so
on, has just reached London (B. 27/9/’23),
indicates that we do sometimes get in first.
The comic opera is by Otto Harbach and
Rudolph Friml, the two Americans who were
also guilty of “High Jinks” and “You’re in
Love.”
“Thersites” : Talking of embarrassing acci-
dents on the stage. We were all (more or
less) dashing officers of the Inniskillings
(period, George the Third) at a regimental
ball on the stage of Melbourne Princess’s—
it was in the third act of Belasoo’s “Sweet
Kitty Bellairs.” Our 0.C., Colonel Kimby
McFiontan, was Harry Ashford, an English
actor, with a Falstaffian equator. While we
were dancing a (more or less) stately
gavotte, Ashford bowed a trifle too low.
There was a noise like the bursting of a
paper-bag, and the corpulent Colonel’s white
satin sine qua lions (by Alias, London) were
hopelessly disintegrated. He couldn’t leave
the stage without spoiling the story, so we
smothered him up, and pinned him together.
He carried on under jury rig until it was
his turn to go off; then he made a dignified
exit backwards. “What’s wrong with him?”
demanded Nellie Stewart, in a surprised
undertone. The Bishop of Bath and Wells
whispered, “He danced so hard he’s lost his
breath and pants.”
“D.F.” : I stick to David Burn as Aus-
tralia’s first dramatist (B. 6/9/’23). He
said so himself in the dedication to Lady
Franklin of his volume published at Hobart
Town in 1842. It was printed by R. Tegg
for W. Pratt, and included four plays, be-
sides a number of fugitive pieces in verse
and prose. One .of the plays was “Regulus,”
a tragedy based on the first Punic War; an-
other, “De Rulleeourt,” dealt with the French
invasion of Jersey in 1781; and a third had
the Britain of James I. as a setting. Then
there was the farce “Our First Lieutenant,”
a sort of faint forerunner of “Pinafore.”
“Second Murderer”: “I Was Dreaming,”
interpolated in “Ma Mie Rosette,” owes its
paternity to Aug. W. Juncker, and not to
Packer, as has been stated. To my mind,
the finish to it supplied by Leon Caron was
totally unnecessary. The second act of “Ma
Mie” is really grand opera. When Charles
Kenningham played Vincent George Mus-
grove said he was the only tenor wffio had
ever sung the music as it was written.

1 never listen, for I know
That men were born to come—and go !
I’ve no objection to a kiss,
A second’s featherweight of bliss;
But kisses long and kisses hot
Have meaning, and I like them not.
A heart intact’s a joyous thing,
Its owner with the world can sing;
And to it men of many climes
Will bring their roses and their rhymes!

The Bulletin
150,000 Miles on Country Roads,
and still running well.
Gentlemen, —I have been running a
12/16 Wolseley Car for the past ten
years, and during this time have covered
150,000 miles, all on country roads.
The car has given me every satisfaction
and is still running well.
Yours faithfully,
( Sgd.) J.H.S.
Endurance.
There is no necessity to write off
75 per cent, of the value of your car
in two years —if it is a WOLSELEY.
The WOLSELEY does not break
springs and have to be towed in. It
keeps on running.
Work it out this way!
Allow 10 per cent, for depreciation
each year, and at the end of ten years
you have your WOLSELEY still in
good order and standing at nothing
in your books.
The post-war WOLSELEY is even
better than the one quoted in the
letter which appears above. It is the
logical choice of all who want a car
of power and beauty that will give
lasting service.
NEW REDUCED PRICES:

ence has the defect of being an old 0ne....E.0.

part.... 8.M.0.: Too long for its small point....
Augustus W.: That’s right. Lash into them: —
We are the League of Nations,
We are tlie .mg lour oi me World;
We build round this Earth fortifications,
So no more War shall behold.
Britain said “no more wars—■
r Half the land of the World is mine.”

.. . .Senojo: Futile. .. . J.H.L.: Doesn’t make much

hears.

swallowed 17 cocktails. .. .Old Colonist: Yes, Ger-

to good; sorry the verse isn’t A.T.A.: Misses,
but not by a mile. . . .Q.R. : “The Great Lover” is too
imitative.... V .B. (Hawthorn): “Tvnau” is not what
we’re hungry for Pavlo: A bit off our beat
Mombak: One slice of the moving tragedy:—
The burglar stalking down the road
Was carrying a heavy load,
For he was going to his lair
To deposit his gold and silver ware;
A policeman on his nightly round
Suddenly hears a stealthy sound
Of footsteps on the opposite side,
As if their sound they sought to hide.
Walking over to investigate
Who was out so very late,
The miscreant stopped arid fired
Hitting the policeman in the side.
The cop, nothing daunted; his revolver dropped
And in deadly grips with the burglar, soon was locked,
Till gripping his villainous throat
He was trying the miscreant to choke.
A deadly knife-thrust the miscreant freed,
And fleeing left the policeman to bleed.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.

“Esmond” : W.A. is determined to grow
cotton, notwithstanding that heT'preliminary
attempts to do so have been rather disheart-
ening. About a year ago the Government
tried to encourage experimental planting by
distributihg seed freely, and by guaranteeing
a price for the stuff raised.' Also, acting
upon the advice of a Queensland expert, it
selected some blocks of land near Derby, and
then hurried a dozen returned soldiers'on to
the land, setting them the difficult task of
clearing and putting in a crop before the.
summer rains. The Derby cotton scheme,
like too many of the State’s enterprises,
proved a failure, and when Colonel Evans, a
British cotton expert, paid a brief visit ’to
W.A. he condemned nearly everything that
had been done in the way of selecting cotton
lands and growing experimental crops. Yet
two men up north at Wyndham have recently
grown, without departmental assistance!
three tons of good-quality seed-cotton from
15 acres planted. This lot has been snapped
up by the Government, and goes to the Em-
pire Exhibition.

Ensures
Beauty
to Skin
and Hair
Be a Rexona Girl!
It Means Health
and Beauty.
Rexona Girls are world-famous for their beauty. To
be a Rexona Girl is to use only Rexona Soap, and enjoy
that natural beauty of the skin and hair which cannot
be imitated, but can be obtained by its regular use.
Ordinary toilet soaps do not assert this influence.
Many of them contain free alkali, which tends to dry the
skin and destroy its delicate texture. Even the best of
such soaps can only cleanse, they cannot heal and protect
the skin.
Rexona Soap contains the same soothing, healing,
antiseptic balsams as Rexona the Rapid Healer, the
value of which in the treatment of skin affections is
known throughout the world.
Simply use Rexona Skin and Facial Soap regularly
once or twice a day, and see if it does not quickly soothe
and cleanse the pores, lessen the tendency to pimples,
and leave the complexion clear, fresh and velvety.

“Ringer”: In the cheap horseflesh com-
petition this should about win. The North
Queensland Register reports that Harry
Green, of Manuka station (N.Q.), recently
bought between 400 and 500 head for £1
the lot, or, say, a ha’penny a head.

“0.P.H.”: Accepting a recommendation
by U.S. expert Graham, the Vic. Govern-
ment is going to spend £OO,OOO in remodelling
Maft'ra beet-sugar factory to enable it to
turn out 400 tons a day when the annual
campaign is on. Graham’s report was about
as long as a three-decker novel, with as
many sections as a New iork Sunday
journal.
* * * *
“Adamascus”: The Bananaland State
sugar-mill at the Tully River will be erected
by Walkers, .Ltd., of Maryborough, whose
tender of £389,000 was the successful one.
It is estimated that £270,000 will be spent
m wages, and nearly all the remainder in
Queensland. The new mill, with a crushing
capacity of 150,000 tons of cane per season,
will oe one of the largest in the State, and
should be working by the end of 1925.
* * * *
“Granny Smith” : Victorians are interested
to see how the newest attempt to sell apples
by the dozen instead of the pound will work
out —Railway Commissioner Clapp is the re-
former this time, having ukased that the
plan shall be adopted at his refreshment-
rooms. It is only two years since the last
experiment was made: a few shops hung out
placards, but I don’t know r of one that stuck
to it for more than a fortnight.
“Jimmy Possum” : That selector at Pullen
Vale (Q.), quoted bv“Jackeroo”(B. 23/8/-’23),
will be turning his jumbucks into his cotton
patch once too often. Both cattle and horses
will eat cotton-plants readily once they
acquire a taste for them, and sheep wili
hardly be an exception. I know a case in
which a Bananaland cocky turned his milk-
ers into his cotton patch, which had become
over-run by weeds and grass. When the
cows had mowed down the grass, etc., they
tackled the cotton, leaving cocky only the
stumps of the plants.
* * * -*
“Geo. Rich”: The bonuses paid in N. S.
Wales and Queensland for dingo scalps (B.
30/8/’23) read like downright sweating
beside the W.A. rate. In South-West
Groperland—where the dingoes destroy
nearly as many sheep as the blowflies
—the bonus is £3. The Vermin Boards pro-
vide two-thirds of this, and the Government
the other quid. To collect the bonus the
trapper must put in a four-inch strip of pelt
with the scalp and tail attached thereto.
Inter-State trade in dingo scalps would be
profitable—but dashed risky.
“Westo” : The Maoriland Government has
a rival in its destruction of public property.
The Queensland Railway Commissioner
periodically destroys all his damaged or obso-
lete tools, tarpaulins, etc. Many cockies’
stacks could be saved and bush huts built
with the discarded impedimenta. But Autho-
rity won’t listen to it. The object, of
course, is to prevent any Crown-branded
material lawfully entering private hands,
since this, it is claimed, would make detec-
i tion difficult in the case of theft of new
material. But if all railway material were
branded and numlered the railway sleuths
ought to be equal to the problem.
“Mendelian”: At Flemington (Sydney)
abattoirs is an officer known as manager of
the animal-foods department, one W. 11.
Paine. When the meat ring has annexed
the carcase of a beast, and the horns, hoofs
and hides have gone somewhere else, there
remain blood, entrails and offal. This used
to be disposed of any old way, to boiling-
down works, pig- and poultry-farmers, etc. -
but Paine has changed all that. He ex-
tracts the tallow, markets the best of the
bones, and reduces what isn’t fit for pig and
food to a valuable manure. Even
the water with which the mess is washed
up is being experimented with to discover
if there isn’t some commercial value in it.
“Aerial” : I am not so sure about machine
telegraphy outing the hand-operator. Recent
Murray Multiplex performance certainly
doesn’t suggest it. In America, the birth-
place and trial-ground of most of the
machine systems, hand-working is being
largely reverted to. Machine telegraphy is
fluky, and no wonder. The Murray type-
writing system necessitates a literal
thunder-shower of dots—approximately 209
separate impulses of current per second. It
takes five of these fleeting impressions to
make each letter or character, and some of
them start from one end and some from the
? ther - r £ wo dots from Sydney and three
from Melbourne make B at Melbourne. The
splendidly-insulated copper circuits of
America failed to carry this lightning skurry.
What chance have the long, indifferently-
insulated Australian lines of handling it?
Our telegraph poles are of a type that went
out ot date 20 years ago. There are approxi-
mafely 00,000 between Melbourne-Sydney
and Sydney-Brisbane, and down every one of
them, particularly in wet weather, these
pinpoints of current escape. The result is
mutilation, repetition and delay. On the
mechanical side consider the flickering rush
of the .tiny steel fingers that make, break and
space current at a 200-to-the-second clip
Ihe staggering avalanche of dots is split
into eight streams, four each way, each
stream depending for guidance to its proper
destination (its particular receiving type-
writer) on the precise similarity, both as
to rotating speed and _ position, of two dis-
tributor-wheels 600 miles apart, this being
the telegraph distance between Sydney and
Melbourne or Brisbane. Let the two wheels
differ ever so slightly and the incoming
letters go to the wrong typewriter. All eight
channels, or streams, are affected. I have
had two years’ experience of the Murray, and
defy anyone to prove it anything but a
costly, if interesting, futility. Seeing that
the comparatively simple and robust Wheat-
stone automatic was never a success on
Australian circuits, there is not much hope
toi the freakishly complicated Murray sys-

Studebaker Light-Six 5-Seater Touring Car— Australian Body, £455; Imported Body, £475.
A world- wide reputation
for quality
Studebaker’s seventy-one years in business have de-
veloped high ideals which in turn have built an en-
viable world-wide reputation for products bearing the
Studebaker name.
Wherever motor cars are used, the name Studebaker
signifies a dependable six-cylinder automobile of the
highest quality and value.
Studebaker cars are made in three chassis types and
twelve body styles. Your inspection of these cars will
readily disclose why Studebaker was the choice of more
than 110,000 discriminating buyers in 1922, and over
80,000 motor car purchasers the first six months of 1923.

Edward Hawson, manager of the Perpetual
Trustees Co., of Tas., recently rounded off
42 years as committeeman and treasurer or
the Speck’s Royal Agricultural Society. This
Marathon specialist also won through to his
golden wedding the other day. He is 80
now, and his back is still straight.
A long-forgotten public identity has blos-
somed once more as head of the N.S.W. Sol-
diers and Sailors’ Fathers’ Association —Syd
Smith, who held office in the Parkes and Reid
Ministries (he was Ma’s first Minister for
Agriculture) and was P.M.G. in the Reid-
McLean Federal Cabinet. Four of his sons
fought in the war, and one was killed.
A persistent gunman but singularly bad
shot is in trouble in Adelaide. Several years
ago he served a year for shooting his wife.
Recently he quarrelled with her—they had
long been reconciled —and she went to the
Adelaide Hospital. Almost immediately he
called there to see hei% and, being allowed an
interview, emptied his revolver at her as
she lay in bed. And still she lives.
A youngster who should make old bones,
if there is anything in heredity, has been left
by the Stork in the Orange (N.S.W.) district,
Its four grandparents are still alive, and so
are three of its great-grandparents, and all
of them are Orange natives and residents.
The Orange-Blayney district has a severe
winter climate, but it breeds ’em tough. At
the funeral of an old lady who died at 103
years at Blayney lately there were five
mourners of over 90.
A cabled yarn that royalty advised Melba
to promptly correct anybody addressing her
otherwise than as “Dame Nellie” recalls an
incident in the Yic. Council of 13 years ago
Balfour rose to move that J. M. Davies be
elected President in succession to Wrixon.
The be-whiskered Jenkins was clerk, and it
was necessary to address him. “Mr. Jenkins,”
began Balfour. “Sir George,” corrected Jen-
kins. The House gasped. Balfour begged
pardon, and began again. So there’s a pre-
cedent.
St. Stanislaus’ College, Bathurst (N.S.W.),
has been celebrating its half-century. When
it opened, in 1873, the teacher of its senior
class was C. J. Coveny. Educated at Stoney-
hurst and Cambridge, he travelled all over
Europe before returning to his native coun-
try, and became in the process a linguistic
expert. He was a barrister by profession
but not by practice, and gave himself to
literature and art. A good deal of his black-
and-white work is in the files of the old
Sydney Punch.
“P. Pawnticket”: The collection-box is
being rattled again by the Sydney A.L.P.,
members of branches having been asked to
pay a shilling levy. Only once in its his-
tory has the A.L.P. been well ahead of it.
When the conscription campaign was raging
a number of employers, fearing the effect on
their staffs, created a secret fund to fight
the proposal, and the money came pouring
in. Currency was so plentiful that a lot
was left over when the campaign had been
fought and won. But numerous fancy jobs
were created, and it didn’t last long.
“Cobba Cobba” : Government Meteorologist
Hunt is paying a visit to all the storm-warn-
ing stations along the Queensland coast, and
expects to have apparatus as far north as
Cairns in apple-pie order before the next
cyclone season. His arrival in Cairns will
finish a journey right round the coast of the
Commonwealth. He is impressed with the
advantages of the Willis Island station, and
is hopeful of shortly having wireless com-
munication established with Lord Howe
Island, about 200 miles to the east of Port
Macquarie. With the help of these he
expects to do far better work in storm-fore-
casting than has been possible hitherto.
“Columbine”: There is a story of Mrs.
Pat Campbell which doesn’t appear in her
memoirs. She had exhausted the patience of
the management then employing her, and it
was resolved that sh e should not be permitted
to play—for one night, at all events. Accord-
ingly she was refused even the right of entry
through the stage-door. But the resourceful
dame was not so easily thwarted. Arriving
early at the box-office, she bought a ticket
for the front stalls without allowing her face
to be seen. By this means she succeeded in
reaching the stage, and her street costume
chanced to be appropriate to the part. The
happy understudy was just preparing to step
into the scene when she felt herself firmly
brushed back between two fire-buckets The
dinkum Mrs. Pat took the applause.
“T. 0.1.”: Henry John Chisholm, who died
at Darlinghurst (Sydney) the other day, was
at one time P.M. at Yass. His father was Cap-
tcnn Archibald Ohishiolin, of the Indian Army
whose wife was a daughter of the Northamp-
ton philanthropist William Jones. In 1839
Captain Chisholm came to Svdney op sick
leave, and when he returned'to India left
his family behind. Mrs. tlhisholm devoted
herself to assisting friendless females, who
'Y 1 e . re coming to the colony in shiploads. Up
till 1845 she had provided homes for 11,000
immigrants, including many men. In 1846
Captain Chisholm returned to Sydney and
took his family to England, where ’ Mrs.
Chisholm lectured on immigration and immi-
grant ships. In 1854 she revisited Australia
and stayed for 12 years. Both she and her
husband, who shared her philanthropic work
died m 1877, within five months of each other’
he at 82 and she at 67. H. J. Chisholm en-
tered N.S.W. Public Service in 1859.

“Mrs. Cowan, introducing a bill in the W.A. Assem-
bly to make women eligible for judgeships and
Ministerial positions, referred to the incongruity of
appointing a man Minister for Motherhood, as had

A topsy-turvy business when Labor’s ruling brother-
hood
Made ramping, bellowing McGirr the Minister for
Motherhood.
Invidious a s his title then, I’ll bet he likes it rather
less
Now he’s an outcast from the clan, disowned and
lone and fatherless.
I wonder if, when next he seeks a seat wherein to
plant his hide
And gets it in the neck, they’ll call the voter’s act
infanticide.

Constance.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
W'HEN infant grass had come, to
The ground where sorrow kneeled,
And Spring with holy tenderness
The wounded clay had healed,
There came, meek-winged and weary-eyed,
Beneath the sapphire dome.
An angel saying, “Constance died
Last year and is not home.
Beneath the lifted veils of light
The tall watch-seraphs stood
And gazed upon the morning white,
And saw that it was good ;
The golden vials, seven on seven,
Filled with the dew of prayer
And faith upheld the walls of Heaven,
But Constance was not there.
Then rose the five search-angels brave,
And went at God’s command
Low down to seek a little grave,
Grown green in Murmurland.
And thrice they beat upon the sod
And thrice they whispered low—
“ Come, Constance! You are late for God;
And’ it is time to go.”
A pleasant wind went through the grass,
They heard its murmur clear —
“Oh, lift your wings and let me pass,
For Constance is not here !
She stands a while in Sliadowland ;
And you may trace her tears,
Pearl-grey upon the cold, wet sand,
Between the fading years.”
Then passed they down by hidden ways,
Through rifts of broken light.
Into the shadow of the days
Beneath the peak of night;
And Constance trembled, stooping low,
From broken steps of prayer.
Into the vault where sad men go
To breathe the dead, black air.
“Up, Constance! New bride-blossoms break
Upon the almond rod ;
The rainbows linger for your sake.
And you are late for God !”
She did not turn her golden head.
Like grey mist was her tone —
“Although God’s flame be murder-red,
I will not go alone.
“They cast my love to black despair;
And till his soul be free.
My voice will hang on broken prayer,
And God may wait for me.” _
The five search-angels rose again,
They crossed the crystal wall.
And came with drooping looks of pain
To God and told Him all.
But the veils of Heaven were lifted still,
And the watchers white and dumb
Stood wondering of a woman’s will;
But Constance did not come.
Till a bolt of God screamed down the air
And made a flame of light.
Wherein were ladders of white prayer
Out of the thickest night.
And Constance, leaning on her love,
Came up with meek, calm eyes,
As the necks of angels craned above
To see the ransomed rise.
And the trumpets made a holy song
For that great thing Heaven saw —
The Lord, omnipotent and strong.
Triumphant o’er His law !
N.S.W.
DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
“The Sins of the Fathers.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HM HE march had been long and arduous
Though past noon, the tropic sun
still beat down in unrelenting fury.
The heat danced in shimmering waves over
the bone-white coral sand, and struck up at
the eyes of the white man who trudged wear-
ily at the head of the column. To the. left
stretched the sea, its broad expanse faintly
rippled by fugitive breezes playing hither
and thither over the surface, but never reach-
ing the shore. To the right was primeval
jungle—dark, forbidding, impenetrable. Here
and there clumps of coco-palms tossed their
heads above the tangled undergrowth, and
in the distance, barely discernible through
the blue haze, towered a majestic, unnamed
peak of the Owen Stanley Range.
The carriers, their brown, almost naked,
bodies bathed in malodorous sweat, wilted
under their loads, and, sulkily mutinous,
kept to the appointed path, under the taunt 3
and jeers of the native police. Presently the
white man called a halt.
“No use overdoing it,” he reflected, as
with grunts of relief police and carriers
dropped their packs, and, squatting on their
heels, sought a brief respite from the rays
of the sun in the shadow of the bush.
Sergeant Sinapa opened a green cocoanut
and passed it to the white man. He drank
listlessly. Was this the eighth or the
eightieth he had consumed since dawn? Pah!
How he loathed the sweetly insipid stuff!
“We stop Joe’s place night-time, Tau-
bada?” asked the sergeant.
“Yes.”
“Ah-h-h! Good fella place, Taubada.
Plenty kai-kai, plenty”—-
“That’ll do!” said the other shortly.
Patrol-officer John Bolton, though new to
the Papuan magistracy, was not a man to
gossip with his non-coms., particularly with
one who had already betrayed an unmistak-
able tendency to presume on that strange,
indefinable bond which exists between the
Papuan magistrate and his native police.
Bolton glanced at his watch, then rose
stiffly to his feet.
“All right, sergeant,” he called. “We go
now. Karaharaga!” (Step lively!)
Under the lash of Sinapa’s sarcastic
tongue, equipment was buckled on, packs
were adjusted, the patrol was hustled into
some semblance of order, and with Bolton
still in the lead the weary march was re-
sumed.
* * # *
Joe Grainger, owner of Gabubu River
plantation, clenched his fists, and there was
a truculent gleam in his eye as he moved
towards his disreputable visitor.
“I’ll give you two seconds to hop. off this
verandah,” he snorted. “My girl isn’t for
the likes of you, you dirty little beach-rat
“Spare me days! Yer ’ot, Joe!” Billy
the Baker scratched his unshaven chin with
an exceedingly dirty forefinger. “Blime.
I’m white, ain’t I? And Laura’s a ’arf-caste,
ain’t she? Strike me lucky, Joe, I’m payin’
yer a compliment, that’s wot I’m doin’, if
y’ only knoo it!”
Grainger winced at the sneer in the beach-
comber’s voice.
“Get out of my house, damn you!’ lie
muttered. His hand reached out towards the
rifle-rack, and the beachcomber beat a hasty
retreat down the steps.
“The flamin’ old goat!” he mumbled, as he
shuffled to the gate. “ ’E’ll be glad of the
likes of me for a son-in-law before e’s
through.”
Laura Grainger, the pretty 18-year-old
daughter of the old planter, was desired of
many men. She was half-caste, else
Grainger had been spared the importunities
of degenerates of the type of Billy the Baker ;
or of evil old men like Sam Lee, the Chinese
b&che-de-mer man; or of Tony Ventella, the
dissolute Dago trader at Ivuabulu. Of clean-
bred, clean-living men of his own race, Grain-
ger knew not one who would seek his daugh-
ter’s hand in marriage. Not even the rever-
sion of the valuable Gabubu property would
tempt the kind of white man Grainger had
in mind. Laura was half-caste. It simply
wasn’t done.
Grainger, his eyes fixed moodily on the
palm-tops as they swung languidly in the
breeze, groaned in bitterness of spirit. Laura
was bone of his bone, flesh of his flesh. He
had never thought of the future, never real-
ised that Laura had become a woman, nor
of what the coming years might hold for
her. Billy the Baker! Sam Lee! Tony
Ventella !. .. . God, what a poor, blind fool he
had been!
The old man roused himself and rose from
his chair. He moved slowly through the
deep, cool living-room to the back verandah.
The garden was a riot of color. Stately
palms mounted guard over a diversity ot
flowering shrubs. The brilliant purple of a
flowering bougainvillea stood out against the
sombre green of its foliage. Grainger’s eye
rested fondly on the figure of his daughter
swinging gracefully in a netted hammock,
slung between two slender betel-palms. Sud-
denly he stiffened.
“Laura!” he called angrily. “Are you
chewing that filthy betel-nut again?”
“I’m only trying it, dad,” she replied.
“Trying it!” Grainger snatched the lime-
pot from her unresisting fingers and crushed
it to fragments beneath his heel. “Laura,
girl, how often have I asked you not to give
way to such beastly native habits?”
The girl pouted mutinously.
“I’m half a native, dad,” she muttered
sulkily. “Who cares what I do?”
“Your daddy cares.” All the anger had
gone out of Grainger’s voice. “You’re half-
white, too, lass,” he said, and he took her
in his arms hungrily.
“Sail-lio-o-o!” A deep-throated roar from
the river-bank broke the silence. Laura ran
lightly to the edge of the garden.
“Dad!” she called over her shoulder,
“there’s a Government patrol on the other
side. It’s your stuck-up friend Mr. Bolton,
I think.”
Grainger laughed.
“That’s fine,” he said. “Sing out to Mairi
to get the canoes over and bring them across.”
Half-an-hour later Grainger and the girl
were at the Gabubu landing shaking hands
with patrol-officer Bolton.
“You look all in. Jack,” the old man said.
“You ought to divide that beach march into
two and take it easily.”
“There’s nothing easy on this trip, Joe,”
replied Bolton. “I'm after Ventella. Wanted
for murder. Sinapa is at the village getting
carriers for to-morrow. We leave again for
Kuabulu at daylight.”
Grainger whistled softly, and led the way
to the bungalow.
“I’m glad you’ve got something on Ven-
tella at last,” he said. “The swine’s been
playing hell in this district for years. Bailed
me up last week and wanted to marry Laura,
damn him !”
Bolton looked shocked, but the girl laughed.
“I think he’s a funny little man,” she
said, and her eyes sought Bolton’s mockingly.
The tropic twilight merged swiftly into
night. The fronds of the coco-palms
rustled soothingly together. The party
had dined early, and Bojton, white-clad in
immaculate drill, lay at ease in a softly-
cushioned lounge. Grainger sat dozing in a
chair near by. From the compound came the
rhythmic beat of native drums. Bolton’s
carriers, plentifully supplied with Govern-
ment tobacco and gorged with Government
rice, were making a new song, glorifying the
strength of their bodies, pitying the madness
of all white men, and defying the anger of
the sun-gods. Laura Grainger sat at the
piano, her fingers passing idly over the keys.
Suddenly the music took on a new note.
Bolton rose quietly and tiptoed to the door.
He started back with a feeling of repugnance.
The girl was half-crouched over the keys,
crashing out a wild, barbaric air. Her face
seemed strangely distorted, her eyes wide
and staring, and her body moved to and
fro sensuously, keeping time to the savage
tune.
“Good God !” gasped Bolton, “she’s set the
old-time dance of the Gabubu head-hunters
to music!”
From the back verandah came the soft
“pad-pad” of naked feet moving to dance-
steps on the palm flooring. Bolton could
have sworn that he recognised the face of
Sergeant Sinapa in the gloom. The music
ceased. The girl looked up, and again Bolton
was conscious of her eyes—half-bold, half-
mocking—smiling into his. Then she was
gone, and Bolton saw her no more that night.
When he returned to his seat Grainger
was awake.
“I want to talk to you, Jack,” he said.
“It’s about Laura.”
Grainger possessed the gift of vivid narra-
tion. He told Bolton of his early struggles
at Gabubu, of the bad old days when human
skulls decorated the ridge-poles of the village

Story.
Are You as Wei I as
You Should Be?
It isn’t right for one to always feel tired, weak—all worn
out. Yet how many folks are constantly ailing, though
seldom sick enough to be in bed! Are you one of these
unfortunates? Do you suffer daily backaches—feel dull
and weary—nervous and dispirited? Is your health
slowly slipping away? It’s time, then, you were finding
the cause. Quite likely it’s your kidneys. A cold, strain
, jn j • ii or overwork lias slowed up your kidneys and brought on
that dull, dragging ache that soreness, stiffness, lassitude and weariness. You may have headaches,
dizzy spells and annoying kidney irregularities, too. Don’t wait for serious kidney trouble, but help
the weakened kidneys with Doan s Backache Kidney Pills. Doan’s have helped thousands. They
should help you. Ask your neighbor I
A MAN’S TESTIMONY.
Mr. A. H. Francis, 192 Union Street, Erskineville,
Sydney, says: “As the result of an attack of influenza a
member of my family suffered terribly from kidney
trouble. The symptoms were various, the most trouble-
some being pains across the smhll of the back. This
ailment was very trying, especially so as every move-
ment seemed to make the suffering more acute. No
position was comfortable, the ache keeping up practically
night and day. One day we were advised to try Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills, and they proved a blessing, six
bottles driving the pain out of the back and restoring the
kidneys to a healthy state. Doan’s Pills are a marvel-
lous kidney remedy, and I am sure sufferers from back-
ache cannot do better than take them. I consider they are
a boon to humanity, and I am never without a bottle in
the house.”
Two years later Mv Francis says : “The cure referred
to still holds good, no signs of kidney trouble having
returned, a fact that Droves Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills give lasting benefit.”
TWO SYDNEY
PEOPLE
CURED OF
BACKACHE
AND KIDNEY
TROUBLE.
A WOMAN’S TESTIMONY.
Mrs. W. P. Ritzau, 364 King Street, Newtown,
Sydney, says: “For years I was a great sufferer from
kidney disease. I have been treated by doctors and in
hospitals, and tortured with operations. After fifteen
months in one hospital I came out a thorough cripple;
I was so ill I was advised to go back into the hospital,
but my husband would not let me go. I was recommended
by a friend to take Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and
commenced using them, carefully following the directions.
These pills have cured me. I can now get about and
do my work, and the pain has completely left me. My
cure is wonderful, for mine was really a very bad case.
Since my cure my uncle has used the remedy and they
have effected a complete cure in his case also. Our
experiences prove that Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are
a positive cure for kidney trouble.”
Eight years later Mrs. Ritzau says: “I have still
the same good opinion of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.
When I feel a slight return of my old complaint I take
them, and they never fail to put me right.”

huts, and death stalked in the jungle; of the
days before the “Big Government” brought
law and order amongst the bloodthirsty sav-
ages of the coast; when the life of the white
man depended solely on his own good
right arm. He told of his early difficulties
in financing the little plantation, of his mar-
riage to Laura’s mother, and of how she had
died in bringing her child into the world. It
was a record of splendid achievement, of
success won against odds which would have
beaten a lesser man.
“I’m an old man now r , Jack,” Grainger
concluded; “a rich old man. And Billy the
Baker—and Ventella—and Sam Lee, the
Chow, are pestering me about Laura—and
think they’re honoring me bv offering to
marry her!” ’
The old man laughed bitterly.
“Listen, Jack,” he said suddenly. “There’s
five thousand in cash and a half-share in
Gabubu for the man I want for a son-in-
law.”
He paused.

into the mountains; spent weeks alone with
crude savages, and all but ruined his health
in the process. fetul, the image of Joe
Lrainger s dark-eyed daughter obtruded on
his mind and dominated his thoughts almost
against his will.
Many moons came and went before Bolton
was again detailed to the coastal patrol,
When he met Grainger at the landing, the
old man looked thin and worn,
“Had a lot of fever lately, Jack,” he ex-
plained in answer to Bolton’s unspoken
question. “And I don’t seem to throw it off
like when I was younger. You’ve still got
Sinapa in the force, I see.”
“Yes,” answered Bolton. “He’s my
smartest non-com.”
“Maybe.” Grainger seemed unimpressed.

Bolton retired early, and relaxing comfort-

He recognised, with a start, the voice of
Sergeant Sinapa
Then, for a time, there was silence, broken
only by the soft rustling of the palm fronds
and the muffled boom of the surface on the
distant reef. He heard the sound of the
gate-latch quietly lifted and dropped; a
short laugh, and then the soft “pad-pad” of
naked feet running towards the river. Bol-
ton rose noiselessly from the bed and tip-
toed to the «lge of the verandah. A feel-
ing of horror gripped him, as he recognised
Sergeant Sinapa and his host’s daughter
running swiftly in the moonlight towards an

Grainger felt himself seized with a blind

friend—abusing an old man’s hospitality.
and desecrating the sanctity of his home
“Bolton!” he shrieked hysterically,
“Come back! Oh! you swine. Come back'

His eyes roved aimlessly, helplessly to
rest at last on the rifle rack. He seized a
.303 with trembling fingers, and, steadying
himself against a verandah post, sighted
carefully and pulled the trigger. As in a
dream he heard the report, and saw Bolton
throw up his arms and drop. Then he
sagged heavily against the verandah rail,
There was a sharp crack, as the flimsy sup-
port parted, and he fell heavily to the
ground.

Angels.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BESIDES myself, I am not aware of
any other man who has seen actual
angels. Half a bottle of Lower
George-street claret and a tiny lump of
sausage soon brought me into touch with
these ethereal beings.
I had made my way along Balmoral Beach
to a curve in the sand not ordinarily fre-
quented on Monday afternoons, and there,
stretched upon my poor stomach, dreamed
of McKee AVright playing green hymns upon
a beautiful Red Pageolet. The sausage and
the hymns and the claret lifted me out of
my shining furrow, and I felt myself being
borne swiftly through the air. The wind,
caused by the speed with which I travelled,
deafened me ; and my house among the rocks
grew to be a mere star’s egg hatching in the
sun. South Head and North Head lowered
their horns across the water, threatening
each other like bulls, while the syren of a
hidden oil-boat helped the illusion with its
queer approach of assonance to a challenge.
All at once I began to come smoothly
down, as you may sometimes see an old
gentleman ride a bicycle with nicest precision
along a slippery declivity. When I had
descended so far that my feet answered to
the touch of the waves, I took off my shoes
and socks in order to enjoy the full benefit
of the sensation. It was amusing to find
that I stood upon only the skin of the sea,
because I didn’t advance on the billows, but
rode up and down in one place, with the sea-
god, inside, moving under.
It was then that the angels came....in
full afternoon, with bright light everywhere.
Not suddenly, nor in a troop ; but as indi-
viduals, each making a separate entrance.
They had no wings, they were without haloes,
and all of them were as naked as Norman
Lindsay could have desired them to be.
The first one to appear was a young man
of a beautiful countenance with widely-
opened eyes ; he sprang, wet and glittering,
from the back of a dolphin, which returned
into the sea directly after it had been de-
livered of . its charge. The angel swam in
the air, using his arms, not after the manner
of wings, but with good, lusty side-strokes,
turning liis body in the sun with glorious
alternations that sometimes put his magni-
ficent breast into shadow, and, again, re-
vealed himself like a golden idol flashing
through Apollo’s hand.
What a contrast I must have represented
—and how disadvantageous to myself—bob-
bing up and down on a rather restive water,
my shoes tied about my throat by their laces,
and beginning to feel a little cold on account
of having forgotten to put on my winter
singlet!
The angel rose high, made a snap at a sea-
gull, and then flew off in the direction of
Maoriland.
I was very sorry to know he had gone, be-
cause I hated being alone, but a shadow over
the foam about my feet caused me to gaze
up again.
An ugly. Asiatic-looking creature, with a
shaven head, sat cross-legged above me; he
was fishing, and his thread passed in such
close proximity as that it would often press
against my cheek. Once I took it from be-
hind my ear and swung it off, tingling in the
swift wind ; but he didn’t appear to notice
anything. After a while he drew up into
his arms a lovely long lily from the sea; this
he fastened about bus waist, I suppose the
better for its carrying, as when he rose pre-
sently in flight he ordered his hands with
so rapid a motion as must have destroyed
anything delicate lie clasped in his fingers.
Next came a pretty maiden, who pouted:
she called me “Plagiarist,” and said I had
stolen “Ragged Softling” from Shakspeare.
I asked where I could find it among his
plays and poetry, but she, dissolving towards
the Fortunate Islands, disdained to answer.
One with black hair (most terrifying)
cried out “Ba!” and accused me of having
traduced his grandmother. Indeed, he grew
so annoyed that lie broke and was consumed
into ashes before he reached the water.
Then there were three little girls who
danced in front of me, very happily; they
had a dog with them which ran up the sky.
exactly like a spider running to the middle
of his net. They all flew after him, and 1
could hear them pushing and scuffling out
of sight, till, suddenly, the dog burst a hole
in a cloud, and rolled head over heels right
into the Pacific. The little girls laughed and
let down a rainbow with yellow and white
chains, so that he scrambled out again, all
dripping with water, and returned into
Heaven. The children picked him up, and.
waving their hands to me, faded from view;
but, before I could be sorry for this, an ex-
tremely amiable lady-angel put into my hands
a _ large, black umbrella, vrhich she said
might prove useful for a protection against
sunstroke. I thanked her as well as I
might, for by this time I was beginning
to feel a little sick on account of the motion
of the waves, which was increasing every
minute.
How I reached the shore remains a mys-
tery. But when I awoke during the late
afternoon I was still queasy; and the um-
brella? Well, notwithstanding that I have
advertised six times in the newspapers, no
lady-angel has so far put in any claim for it.
