The Red Page
The Plight of England
In England After the War Charles F.
G. Masterman, P.C., has produced a work
of great interest. No other post-war volume
I have read has portrayed so vividly the con-
dition of Britain’s middle classes, of her
returned “heroes,” of her surviving aristo-
cracy, of her ruined industries and her un-
employed millions.
An aristocracy exists, says Masterman,
for the purposes of war. But the French
aristocracy had perished or lay hidden in
the Faubourg St. Germain; the Austrian
had rotted through superstitions, inbreeding
and the gaiety of Vienna; the Russian was
both pleasure-seeking and incompetent. On
the other hand, the chivalry of the Gorman
Empire went out to war as of old, and, forti-
fied by a carefully-trained apparatus of in-
tellectuals, was able for nearly five years
to keep half the world at bay without one
really decisive defeat. The British aris-
tocracy possessed no such educated machine,
but it exhibited the old qualities of courage,
devotion, care for the men under its charge
and character which put new life into the
forlorn hope. “Remember,” said an oincer
to embryo subalterns of the governing class
—“remember that when the day ot battle
comes, you are in charge of 25 men, not <ct>.
What happens to yourself does not matter
at all.” And the flower of this aristocracy
perished heroically. ~ , _ , .
The Great War killed also English feudal-
ism—not by confiscation, but by taxation,
wiping out the old land-owning system which
extended from 1066 to 1914. In one year
one firm of auctioneers disposed of the area
of an English county. Noble castles, majestic
residences pass under the hammer daily.
Half Rome and many of the great cities of
Italy have been raised from the stones of
buildings which were the glories of _ the
Roman Empire. Such a fate may await m
coming years the historic houses of. Britain.
Ruskin once told the English squires that
they would yet have to fight for their land
against legal seizure by the operations of
the new-enfranchised Parliament. He dated
this seizure about 1880. Actually it has
come 40 years later. .
The grinding-down and the grinding-out
of the English middle classes occur simul-
taneously. Richford, a typical Mdddle-Class
suburb, has its standards, its clean streets,
its decent clothing, Its agreeable manners.
Just on its borders, and always prepared
seemingly to engulf it, are those great masses
of humanity which accept none of these
standards, and Richford feels such an appre-
hension and disgust for these hordes as
existed between the white and negro m the
Southern States of America. Naturally, it
is staunch Tory, and always provides volun-
teers to “blackleg” every tram or coal or
municipal strike. But the civilisation of
Richford had been built on the belief that
a sudden doubling in prices was impossible
in this lifetime. Before the war the suburb
lived a little beyond 'its income. Since then
prices have doubled; taxation has trebled,
and Richford sees itself approaching the
abyss. First, the general servant goes, and
mother becomes the drudge of the family.
Next the villa takes a lodger. A little
later meat diet gives place to farinaceous
foods—-cereals, lentils, etc. The children
are taken from school earlier, and the arri-
val of a new baby is regarded as a disaster.
In one of Masterman’s cases the husband
“gives up half his smokes,” walks to save
half his tram-fare, sells any old article not
required. This Middle Class is the Intelli-
gentsia of England; yet this body is perish-
ing of cold and hunger, and no Government
lifts a finger to save it.
Then with regard to Labor, the most
outstanding feature common to the docker
in London, the mine-repairer in the Rhondda
and the sliiphand of Glasgow is a sense of
absolute disbelief in the goodwill and good-
faith of those ruling him, whether they are
Lloyd George or the “bleedin’ mawsters.”
The core and centre of these embittered
groups are the returned soldiers. “It’s a
rotten old country to go through hell for
and to lose two brothers for,” was one com-
ment. “Millions the company ’awve made
during the war” is the fixed belief of the
South Wales miners. “The Kaiser we licked
buys himself a castle and we that licked him
we have nowhere to lay our heads,” cries
a speaker on Glasgow Green. One notable fact
about the leading men in British labor circles
is that “almost all those adequately equipped
for the business of life found their original
stimulus in the activity of church or chapel.”
They completely disbelieve the miraculous
parts of the Gospel narrative, and have no time
for the doctrine of Christ’s divinity, but
express admiration for His character and
teaching. Those behind them have a store of
strength and patience of which England may
well be proud. “How little on the whole
they demand of life and how little life gives
them!” It is a fact which cries “Shame on
us!” that the golden time for myriads of
English workers, particularly woman, was
during the war. Thousands of families
found themselves for the first time in their
lives well-fed, well-paid and well-cared for.
This continued for nearly two years after
the war; then suddenly the whole thing came
to an end like the sudden stopping of a
clock. This redeemed population, owing to
world reactions, fell in a heap into the abyss
of unemployment, where it remains to this
day.
Towards the close of his study Masterman
devotes a chapter to babies. “An increasing
number of millions in Britain and elsewhere
are acquiring knowledge which means a com-
plete and deliberate defeat for Nature’s de-
mand for limitless fecundity. The old argu-
ment of ‘unnaturalness’ carries weight no
longer... .To the demands for numerous
fresh children for cannon fodder the women
of Europe will give one reply: ‘You say we
must breed children to be killed in future
wars. We say that if you cannot avert such
wars we will breed no children. Let the
race perish that acquiesces in such criminal
lunacy!’” The trouble is that it is the
middle classes and the better-to-do workers
who are ceasing to breed while the propaga-
tion of the slum-dwellers and the unfit goes
merrily ahead. And can a C 3 population
build up an A 1 nation?

Jade and Reeds
I Some years ago, when a little book called
“The Lute of Jade” appeared in the “Wisdom
of the East” series, a great many English
readers woke up to the fact that Chinese
poetry was more like English poetry in motive
and method than that of any non-European
country. At first it seemed that this might
be due to the translator, Cranmer Byng.
Some of us remembered how in Young s trans-
lation of Sophocles many phrases and
cadences were astonishingly like Milton ; and
like Milton, not because they were m the
original Greek, but because the translator
was himself soaked in the great English poet.
A comparison, however, of the alleged trans-
lations from the Chinese with translations
by the same hand from the Persian went far
to convince us that the things which hau
arrested our attention in “The Lute of Jade
were really in the original. Now in 1 lie
Lost Flute (Fisher Unwin), rendered into
English by Gertrude Lauglilin Joerissen from
the French of Toussaint, who trans-
lated from the original Chinese, we have an
anthology of lyrics in English prose which
easily maintains all that was suggested by
“The Lute of Jade.” These little bits of
prose suggest the very fragrance and deli-
cacy of Chinese song, and make us feel that
we are away in no dark places of the Asiatic
mind, but in ways as green as our own, and
as full of air and sunshine. Not only is this
so, but we also note, from the dates given,
that similar qualities are found in the verses
written in the 13th century b. 0., and at the
present day. Several modern lyrics of men
still living are included ; one is actually an
address to a European lady.
Perhaps It is the historical aspect of these
little fragments of thought and color that is
the most attractive of all. Here is the ex
ample which gives its title to the book: —
In long, black lines the wild geese cross the sky.
In the trees one sees the deserted nests. Winter heavi-
ness seems to have settled upon the mountains.
Close to my fountain I found your flute of jade
which you lost last summer. The tall grass had
screened it from our searching. But now the grass is
dead, and the flute lay gleaming in the sun.
I have been thinking of our love which has lain
so long buried under our scruples.
That was written by Chan g-Wou-Kien. who
is just 10 years younger than Roderic Quinn.
And here is the “Song of the Whitened
Heads” :
Over and over you told me, “We shall grow old
together. Together at the same time, your hair and
mine will turn white as the snow on the mountain,
white as a summer moon.” To-day, Seignior, I have
learned that you love another, and with broken heart
I say adieu. . .
One last time let us pour out the same wine into
our tw'o cups. One last time sing me the song which
tells of the dead bird under the snow; then I will
set sail on the river Yu-Keon, whose waters divide
and flow to the east and to the west.
Why are you weeping, young girls about to marry ?
Perhaps you will marry a man with a faithful
heart, a man who will tell you sincerely, over and
over, “We shall grow old together.”
That, with its exquisite appreciation of life
values, was written while Egbert, the West
Saxon, was struggling for a chief place
among the English.
But what about the “concrete image ’ which
has lately been so insisted on as the basis of
all poetry? Here is an extract from the “Le-
chi-kin,” an anthology covering the ground
from the 13th to the Bth centuries b.c., which
makes its direct appeal to the artist who sees
in form: —
At the Western Gate of the city, maidens light and
undulating as the clouds of Spring are laughing.
But I disdain their charms, for in her white dress
and under her thick veil my friend is far more
graceful. ,
At the Eastern Gate of the city, maidens radiant
and beautiful as the flowers of Spring are dream-
ing, but I disdain their charms, for in her white
dress and under her thick veil my friend is sweeter
still.
Listen, William Shakspeare!
Bring me no more flowers. Bring me cypress
branches in which to plunge my face.
Listen, Alexander Pope!
Give up study, and you will be saved much
vexation.
Listen, Austin Dobson and Locker-Lampson!
The birds chirping in the trees awaken me. Already
the sun has warmed the awning of my window. I
stretch myself, but close my eyes again. My blanket
has a delicious warmth. My pillow is as soft as
heart could wish.
It is a moment, above all delicious, w'hen I am
incapable of thinking. I no longer know whether I
am old or young. I do not even know on which
side of the room my bed is.
It seems to me as if the seven openings in my
head no longer existed, and that my wife will come
and take me for a big butterfly-grub waiting for
the coming of Spring.
That was written in the time of Charle-
magne.
Behind all these prose translations it is
possible to hear the rhythmic cadence of
words in an unknown tongue. We cannot
but feel that the translators have, done their
work curiously well, and that in the original
there is something which only Europe and
China could think. And so utmost east and
west draw together, cutting out an infinite
number of things that speak in another and
less defined language of the soul.

Where Ignorance Is Wise
It seems difficult to argue on music with
a man who admits he is entirely ignorant of
its structure, and does not want to be en-
lightened. On the other hand, if his state-
ments (R.P. 10./l/’24) were allowed to
stand, readers might conclude that it has
been left to Mr. Lester Way to discover that
the generations of music-lovers, who have
admired and appreciated good music, have
been entirely wrong, and that the true in-
wardness of music was only beginning to
dawn upon the world since Mr. Way’s dis-
coveries.
It is, therefore, desirable to emphasise
again that there is no music without “struc-
ture”—it is at the root equally of a child’s
song and of a fugue. Music, more than the

other arts, is reared on a physical basis.
Ratios and numbers are its essence, work-
ing on tliis arithmetical foundation, the com-
poser conveys his sentiment, his emotion,
his thought. The clearer his construction,
the clearer liis intention will be made mani-
fest. But the perception of the artist’s idea
is an intellectual process, and full {esthetic
enjoyment depends upon the degree of each
person’s education and comprehension.
That, however, does not prevent the un-
educated from enjoying bad art. Some jieople
will be pleased with a mere dab of color; a
picture with faulty perspective riiay charm
others; some will be satisfied with a cup
having defective curves, or admire a building
of wrong proportions. As long as these
people do not pose as art critics, there is no
reason to interfere with their enjoyment.
Mr. Way’s own words are that all lie per-
ceives of music is the sound it makes. Now,
as sound without structure is simply “noise,”
a foghorn should give pleasure to Mr. Way.
But hold! Do I say “pleasure”? I should
have said “provocation” ! Music, he states,
gives him no pleasure, but “provokes” him,
and serves to bring out his torturing pas-
sions, etc. If the function of all art is not
to give pleasure or joy, what does it give?
Here Mr. Way offers no suggestion, and his
idea of a musician being a vendor of plea-
sure is no different than if he called him a
vendor of provocation.
According to Mr. Way, music is the toy
of the aristocracy. Yes, but the aristocracy
of the intellect. In all ages that class alone
has been able to discriminate between the
good and bad in art, and has guided the
public to appreciate and encourage genius.
The rank and file of humanity always follow
their intellectual leaders, and it may be said
the degree that a people has become per-
meated with the sense of the beautiful is an
index to the worth of that people’s civilisa-
tion.
Mr. Way’s hair-splitting on “theme” and
“subject matter” in reference to Shakspeare
is irrelevant, for the simple reason that the
two terms are equivalent, and in his allu-
sions to Pope and Dryden he wanders away
from the point at issue.
As to the classics, here also Mr. Way
admits that he knows nothing of their true
worth, and yet lays down the law and pro-
claims that on rare occasions he has “heard
music that was art, and art of a very fine
sort, too.” Coming from a self-avowed musi-
cal illiterate, this sounds farcical.
To conclude this somewhat long-drawn-out
controversy, let me quote from the celebrated
case Whistler v. Ruskin, when the Attorney-
General (the Sergeant Buzfuz of the
day) asked Whistler: “Do you think, now,
that you could make me see the beauty of
that picture?” and Whistler replied: “No!
Do you know, I fear it would be as hope-
less 'as for the musician to pour his notes
into the ear of a deaf man ?”
ERNEST WUNDERLICH.
The Old Eternal Gods
Between Norman Lindsay’s and Wallace
Nelson’s observations (R.P. 20/12/’23) let us
try to find more accurately Shakspeare’s orbit
and his place in it. As Nelson points out,
Lindsay falls from an aerial platitude into
the bottomless pit of superstition when he
declares that “only a Shakspeare has a right
to criticise Shakspeare.” This was the very
error the Romans (in another field) made
with their Caesars. In deifying Julius and
Augustus Caesar they only built pedestals for
a Tiberius and a Heliogabalus. The latter
logically carried the cult to the same bottom-
less pit when he deified his horse.
That Shakspeare could do and did a lot
of hack work goes without saying. For ex-
ample, the Dirge in “Cymbeline.” If that
be not Shakspeare’s own hand, no matter
who his collaborators in the play, then no-
thing is Shakspeare’s, and Bacon may bid
for the laurels again. Take only a few lines
of it:—
....the ruddock would
With charitable hill (O bill sore-shaming
Those rich left heirs that let their fathers lie
Without a monument) bring thee all this.
It is absurd to argue (otherwise anyone
can argue on any absurdity) that there’s
more than one hand here. Yet the lines
within the brackets, though fine in senti-
ment, are typical of every error a poet or
dramatist can make when nodding, or,
rather, fading away into dreamless slumber.
Nevertheless, such is the supreme beauty of
the Dirge itself that it inspired Collins to
the hopeless task of imitation by way of
homage to it. And so almost everywhere
with Shakspeare, except perhaps in his son-
nets and songs. But to read him with the
pencil in hand is not to love or revere him
the less, but rather the more. Blind love
nine times out of ten is fool love, and often
the lowest of all tributes to the object of
one’s affection.
So far Wallace Nelson helps us in finding
the true orbit. But there he flies off at a
tangent. “After all,” he says, “there is not
a very great difference between the mind that
wrote Hamlet and the mind that understands
it and enjoys it.” If that be true, then the
mind of every admirer of the dome of St.
Peter’s at Rome is on equality with Angelo’s!
Every Philistine will bow down in homage
to that kind of cheap image and offer cheaper
incense to it. He proves nothing who proves
too much. Then Nelson goes on to deal with
what he calls Shakspeare’s “platitudes.” A
politician, he says, would be hissed off the
platform for uttering such a one as this:—
....To thine own self be true,
Thou eanst not then be false to any man.
Personally, I would like to be hissed into
immortality (as Burke was) if only I could
imagine or say a thing like that. Wherein
lies the platitude? Only in the universality
of the truth conveyed in it. That’s genius
—the unfailing hallmark of genius. Every
universality, as soon as it is so expressed
and perceived, becomes a platitude. And it
does so because of its universality. One
might well refresh one’s mind with a dip
into Anatole France on this very subject.
The highest mountain peaks on the earth
are, compared with the size of the earth’s
circumference, but as the tiny breaks on the
surface of the round orange. Never-
theless, Mt. Everest is Mt. Everest;
and so is Shakspeare Shakspeare. And
as to Nelson’s opinion that with Shaks-
peare it was only or all a matter of expres-
sion—well, then, any scene-painter with a
few pots of color can “take off” “The
Madonna of the Chair,” and the difference
between the result and Raphael's is only one
of “expression.” One must always be on
one’s guard against the tyrannies and fal-
lacies contained in words, and especially in
the word “expression.”
A. S. L.
Venus and the Primitive Beast
In these Freudian days one cannot but
have a slinking respect for anyone who
makes so magnificently generous a self-
exposure as David McKee Wright in his
article “Dogma and Poetry” (R.l\
17/l/’24), attacking our Anthology, “Poetry
in Australia 1923.” As to his denunciations
of the preface by Norman Lindsay, I could
not possibly hope to imitate his stertorous
jeremiads, and so am quite willing to allow
him to convince all to whom righteous uproar
represents an argument. There is one part,
however, which I would like to analyse, as
it touches a curious point in relation to
David McKee Wright himself. He notes
with glee that Norman Lindsay, speaking
of the expectation of a great poet in Eng-
land, remarks that this poet “would carry
a dying age back to vitality of Mind, and
rid us for a little of the primitive beast in
Man triumphant over all vital issues in
Life and Art.” McKee Wright then applies
the criterion of the Primitive Beast to the
Anthology, to his own great satisfaction.
What is interesting here is that he completely
misses the meaning of the term, and demon-
strates indubitably as the alleged Primitive
Beast, not the anthologists, but himself.
Hate is the basic emotion of all primitive
organisations. Havelock Ellis in his lately
published “Little Essays of Love and
Virtue” has a strangely subtle passage in
whieh he points out that Passion is not a
primitive emotion, but that Hate is. “It is
more Passion we need, more Passion,” he
cries in emphatic repetition. I do not ask
McKee Wright to try to understand this,
for by his own demonstration he himself
stands for all mat is opposed to Life and
Passion, and therefore allied to Plate.
What is Passion? The automatic response
to sex in the animal is not Passion. It is
merely the unconscious, unmeaning reaction
to external stimulus and a periodicity of
the blood. Whatever dreams of desire, what-
ever laughter and delight in the embrace,
have been added to sex by man remove it
to a happy heaven of beauty which is the
furthest ascent from the animal. Could a
dog or a wharf-lumper get an emotion of
loveliness from a marbled kiss of Rodin’s?
Could McKee Wright be stimulated by the
golden body of Titian’s Danae? Obviously
not.
How, then, it may be asked, can the animal
react even with hatred to a thing which is
furthest removed from it? The simple
animal of course will not, because the ex-
pression of Beauty’s sensuality will not
touch it at all. But where the animal has
become “refined,” tamed, etiolated, and its
natural simple functions damaged and re-
pressed, it will turn with a snarl on all that
defines an active condition of beauty, i.e.,
wherever the image of beauty is related to
the action of life: where, for instance, the
emotion of Love is translated directly to the
touch and ecstasy of actual bodies, instead
of mere talking about Love. For the re-
pressed animal will fight to the last against
all that would force vitality and passion
upon it, since, as it has no self-knowledge
and self-control, it knows in the dark strata
of its subconscious that if it abandons itself
to an emotion, it will become irresponsible
and return to the blood-lusts of the jungle
from which it has so lately escaped. The
poetry it will favor then will be that in
which it talks about abstract virtues, abstract
emotions and all the little tendernesses that
give it a feeling of good-will, generosity and
humanity. For it needs these things. In
short, its poetry is that of David McKee
Wright.
If this drawing-room sentiment which
seems so innocent in its castration, and which
indeed claims to be noble, dominates Life,
then vitality must disappear and all brutal
impulses, instead of being kept under, let
loose.
Therefore when Kenneth Slessor, in the
pages so chastelv announced by McKee
Wright by their bare numbers, gives a de-
lightful picture of Sterne wooing a girl with
gay imagery of beauty such as
breasts
Like ivory fruits, unbared a bending-trice
Whilst Janatone leans over apricocks
To bite their stalks off—aye, and silken knees
Reveal’d in twinkling foams of dimity
When Libertine winds run under maidens’ frocks —
And when those frocks are tugg’d, small naked
shoulders
That suddenly rise from ruffs of Mechlin lace,
Veined with sly, riotous roses, then subside
In quicksands of wild Sattin and bubbling silk....
he has brought to birth a myriad dreams of
Love, added to the futurity of Life an ascend-
ing stimulus, decorated with that intensity
the kisses of a myriad girls to be. Let
David McKee Wright keep on writing
prettily for the horde of repressed savages.
Poetry such as the above comes from a con-
dition of Life and goes to a condition of
Life of which he can only know the exis-
tence in such blind responses to Hate as that
to which, in the name of injured decency
and outraged virtue, he has here given utter-
ance.
JACK LINDSAY.
A Satchel of Books
Uncommon Sense, by John Blake (C. Arthur Pear-
son). “In this book one of life’s successes tells
you how to succeed.” It is a fine collection of the
obvious and the platitudinous, and the worst failure
camping in the Domain to-night would probably
have written it better.
The Evil Vineyard, by Marie Hay (Putnam). An
unwholesome story of a haunted house, which drives
its archaeologist owner mad and kills him while
he is in the act of murdering his young wife—only
she happens to have been led out of her bed oppor-
tunely by her benevolent spook, and so lives to marry
the other man. The sort of yarn that is best left
unread.
Typical Australian! Scenes, by W. D. Walker, B.Sc.
(W. K. Thomas and Co., Adelaide). A folio of views
reproduced from illustrations which accompanied
several articles in the Adelaide Observer dealing
with trips to Central Australia and the west coast
of Australia. There are interesting glimpses of life
in the far interior —bird and animal pictures—and
some fine snaps of porpoises and seals. The notes
supplied and a brief introduction giving a few salient
facts about the Commonwealth make the brochure
well worth posting overseas.
The Man About Town, by “A.P.H.” (Heinemann).
A collection of London Punch sketches which deal
amusingly with golf, yachting, charity, theatre-going,
divorce and other diversions of the idle rich.
Gramophone Nights, by Archibald Marshall and
Compton Mackenzie (Heinemann). Thirty-one pro-
grammes, with brief notes on the numbers. Few
people may want to follow these programmes as
they stand —most people will want variety, and not
an evening devoted entirely to, say, Spanish or
Gothic or Oriental music. Hut there is good advice
about needles, records, etc., and gramophone enthusi-
asts who want something more than jazzes will
find the little volume a big help in the choice of
a “library.”
A Perfect Dap, by Bohun Lynch (Collins). This is
a book for uxorious husbands. It pictures with in-
finite detail the delight of a man awaiting the return
of his wife who has been absent seven months. He
stai'ts off with a beautiful description of a summer’s
morning in the West Country of England, and then
regales us with the trivialities of his experience
whilst his expectation warms up for the coming
Event. The yarn is a bridegroom’s lyric, but is
saved from sloppiness by a capable craftsman’s taste
for words.
Shetland Pirates, and other Wild Life Studies, by
Frances Pitt (Geo. Allen and Unwin). Another
volume on the lines of this observant author’s
“Woodland Creatures” and “Wild Creatures of Gar-
den and Hedgerow,” in which she talks entertainingly
and intimately upon birds and mammals of the British
Isles. The Shetland pirates of her title are the
great and Arctic skuas, those winged capitalists of
the North who let the gulls do the fishing, then so
scare them on the wing that they disgorge their
catch in mid-air for the skuas to scoop up before
it reaches the water.
A Vision of Morocco, by V. C. Scott O’Connor
(Thornton Butterworth). This is the man who wrote,
years ago, “The Silken East,” which brought Burmah
so realistically before its readers, and, more recently,
“The Charm of Kashmir,” a singularly colorful travel-
book. In this latest volume he achieves another fine
success. Morocco, that amazing mixture of Yester-
day and To-day, with its romance and tragedy and
its indomitable spirit, left untouched by the sweep
of civilisation at its very gates, is here put on the
printed page in a masterly fashion. The author
brings to his task, not only a keen observation and.
a telling descriptive poyver, but a fine historical
sense combined with a poetic appreciation of color
and romance. A delightful volume, from every point
of view.
The Ladies of Lyndon, by Margaret Kennedy
(Heinemann). The theme is the cruelty and shallow-
ness of fashionable society, and the wisdom of
scorning it. Sir John Clewer owns Lyndon, and
marries a beautiful girl of his own class whom he
worships. He loses her love and dies in loneliness.
His brother, James, treated for years as mentally
deficient, marries an uneducated housemaid, de-
velops into a painter of genius, and is happy lead-
ing the life of a cottager. The illiteracy of Dolly
Clewer is overdone, and the affection of her bril-
liant husband for antimacassars and second-hand
gramophones is somewhat incredible, but these are
spots on the sun. In malicious humor, in charac-
terisation, and as a picture of English county life
this novel ranks with the best work of the authoress
of “The Caravanners.”
The Proverbs of Goya, by Blamire Young (Jona-
than Cape). Blamire Young here sets out to demon-
strate, with much asperity, that Beruete’s inter-
pretations of the Master’s etchings are ridiculous.
Young takes the plates one by one (they are admir-
ably reproduced), and tells the world for the first
time in a hundred years what message Goya in-
tended to deliver through them. Blamire Young
loves liberty, and hates militarism and religious
bigotry, and if we are to accept his view Goya
waged angry war against these things by means of
his drawings. It may have been so, though the
military authorities and the Inquisition officials of
18th-century Spain probably had as sharp eyes for
insubordination in art as he has. Anyhow, his
theories are extremely interesting, and they prove, if
nothing else, that Biamire Young can write as well
as he paints.
Mary Magdalen, by Edgar Saltus (Brentano s).
This is a welcome reprint of Saltus’s little known
story of the Crucifixion, written in the colored
staccato style which appeals so strongly to lovers
of good prose. Saltus commences his narrative from
the death of John the Baptist, cleverly picturing the
life, the vices and the superstitions of the time,
and ending up with the tragedy of Calvary on a
strangely alluring note of sadness and desolation.
Christ, 'Pontius Pilate, Herod, Caiaphas and Mary
herself are drawn to the scale of historical compari-
son, and one of the features of the book is the
terrible wooing of Mary by Judas a wooing in
stealthy, sidelong phrases that over-rate the intelli-
gence of the man.
One of the Guilty, by W. L. George (Chapman
and Hall). This story of one Owen Prendergast,
graduating through stamp-box thefts into the higher
ranks of crime, is the nearest approach to a popular
shriek that this usually thoughtful writer has yet
given us. Prendergast, however, isn’t any gallant
of the highway. He helps a little slum girl only to
abandon her ruthlessly when he is in danger of
capture, and he pursues blackmail, burglary and
bucket-shop swindling with an automatic ferocity that
makes his subsequent confession in the police court
all the more incredible. What is more astounding is
that a delicately-nurtured damsel, whose education
and instincts would ordinarily be revolted by his
awful record, should ultimately marry him after he
has done five years, though she had previously dropped
him for another when she believed him an honest
man. Many of the scenes are pure melodrama.
Decline of Western Civilisation, by Oswald Spen-
gler. The fact that 200,000 copies of this book
have been sold in the German, and that an English
translation is on the market, may impress the
Teutonic mind with a sense of Spengler’s import-
ance as a teacher; yet the world at large will
probably judge the value of his work by its Prussian
color. Spengler foresees a near future when “mighty
armies of professional soldiers will hold sway and
powerful personalities will appear, even as in the
days of the Roman Empire, when ancient culture
was decaying..., A new form of Christianity will
be evolved in Russia during the next few centuries,
and this may be the beginning of a new civilisation,
which will take the place of our own.” A man
who slaves at writing a book in order to persuade
us that the kingdom of militarism and “supermen”
is at hand is surely permeated with the spirit that
pushed the Kaiser into his World-Conquest War.
A truer prophet would probably foretell the coming
annihilation of militarism from the air. How are
mighty armies of professional soldiers to hold sway
when the destruction of whole communities shall
be possible by a few hundred young men who exploit
the inventions of engineers and chemists? No
prophet is worth considering who ignores the splen-
did possibilities for civilisation of aeroplanes and
poison gases.
The Saar Question, by Sydney Osborne (Allen and
Unwin). The author repeats many of the arguments
used in his “The Upper Silesian Question and Ger-
many’s Coal Problem.” The French are in the Saar
by virtue of Article 45 of the Versail.es Treaty “as
compensation for the destruction of the coalmines
in the north of France, and as part payment towards
the total reparation due from Germany for the
damages resulting from the war.” The Saar Basin
may be overwhelmingly German, as Mr. Osborne
asserts; or it may contain 150,000 French sympa-
thisers, as Clemenceau and others have claimed; it
may approve of French rule or hate it. Such ques-
tions are of merely academic interest now, since
the presence of France in the Saar is an accomplished
fact. The Treaty provides for a plebiscite at the end
of 15 years, to decide whether the French shall go or
stay ; and since Clemenceau himself did not claim that
the Basin was more than a fifth Gallic, it should not
be difficult to forecast the decision. Meantime it is
queer logic for the author to present the French as
coal thieves. The Germans systematieallv destroyed
the mines in the Nord and Pas-de-Calais. It is
no more than bare justice that those of them who
are in a position to make partial repayment
should be required to do so, and it will be a bad
dav for the pacifist principles held by men like Mr.
Osborne should the opposite principle ever be
established.

knows that early fallowing is the best means to that
end* To fallow economically and efficiently he needs
abundant power, and it is this problem of power that
emphasises the importance of the CASE Tractor*
Kerosene Farm & General Purpose Tractor
Every farmer can appreciate the advantage of a strongly built tractor
that will develop the horse power the CASE 15-27 does* It offers
numerous advantages over other tractors of similar power—it is specially
adaptable for plowing, discing, harrowing, seeding, etc. —it delivers
maximum pull at the drawbar* It will work satisfactorily in heavy soil or
when field conditions are unfavourable* It will do the work of two 8-horse
teams, yet it can be operated by one man, and all the work associated
with horse teams eliminated* It can be worked day or night—in hot
or cold weather* All the belt work on the farm can be linked up to
the CASE* It is specially built to stand the strain of farm work, and
being light on oil and fuel, is econo-
mical to operate. For easy manipula -
tion and general usefulness on the farm,
it excels in all classes of work. Investi-
gate the CASE Tractor proposition and
secure the power needed for Summer
fallowing and all your farm operations.

The Blue Lagoon.
I came upon a pool as still as air—
A blue lagoon, cool-chaste as moonlit jade.
My footsteps on the brink no echo made,
And there was not one murmur anywhere..
The quiet dusk unbound her soft, brown hair,
A noiseless leaf fell through the cool, green
shade;
And one long slender shadow seemed to wade
In soundlessness across the stillness there.
I felt a cold breeze touch me and depart;
There was a phantom rustle at my ear —
A ghost’s thin voice that whispered “Death”
to me.
I heard my own soul tapping at my heart;
Yet as I turned to leave that place in fear
A snow-white lily opened languidly.

The Last Manuscript.
The poet fire that burned in me of old
Is dead. The last time has my pen been
dipped.
My brain is fever-hot, my heart ice-cold;
I am a finished, folded manuscript:
A pretty stanza scribbled by a child;
A rhythmic verse of growth ; one single line
Of wondrous poetry; and then a wild,
Mad satyr-song of women, haste and wine!
After the death that I am waiting for,
Slip me in my long wooden envelope.
Address to “Heaven,” so I’ll be exposed
To judgment by the last great Editor:
And then endorse, with all due lack of hope,
“If Heaven cannot use, find stamps enclosed.”

Herding.
Were I a shepherd boy in Arcady,
Herding my flocks upon the mountains
there,
I should have brought my little reed with me
To play my joyous heart out while the fair
Red poppies grew to languish at our feet—
For the hot sun they courted, far too frail.
And, homeward ’neath the moon, we’d hear
the sweet,
Soul-rending cadence of the nightingale.
But here I see the ramparts of the hills,
Pink-faceted, with lines of sepia cleft;
I cannot make reed-melody that thrills,
Or sing wild lays.... all that is wisely left
To the soft-noted butcher-bird, who turns
His sleek, pied throat up to the am’rous
sun,
Which with a deeper golden ardor burns
Until the songster’s gamut has been run!
And while the hungry cattle stray and graze
We crouch among the lucerne’s springy
green,
Face downwards, where the slender flowers
raise
Their purple heads above our own to lean.
Ah! sweeter than the shepherd’s tuneful lay
Or bird-song under moons of Arcady,
And kinder than all suns that kiss and slay,
Is your companionship, my dear, to me!

A Duet.
We heard the ocean murmuring
At midnight, faint and far,
Across the lake’s enchanted ring,
Beyond the shadowy bar.
Pale was the night, with drowsy heat
On lake and shore and sea,
A night of spells, of silent, sweet
Primeval mystery
Till on the lake the half-moon cast
Her shining boomerang,
While still from out the lonely vast
The ocean softly sang.
Dream islands woke beneath that moon;
And from a secret tree
A strange bird trilled a reedy tune
In challenge to the sea.
In all the quiet nothing stirred
The opal lake along,
Only the ocean and the bird
Who answered song with song.
The bird sang; and like silver rain
He scattered near and far
His reed-notes to the sea’s refrain
That called beyond the bar.
And as he carolled down the track
Under the magic sky,
The Southern Ocean answered back
The bush bird’s lonely cry.

Passed On.
The days are full of yellow light,
The evenings grey with unshed rain;
The moths come fluttering in the night
Against my window pane.
The cheery lamp has set a glow
About my papers and my books;
The ■worn year’s breath is thin and slow
And still he peers and looks,
And asks me why they do not come—
His happy friends of quiet days—
And why my lips have grown so dumb
When others blame and praise.
Old year, the hours will close your eyes
At midnight, when the dark hills rest,
And leave you with the ancient wise,
Hands folded on your breast.
Oh, clamorous heart! Oh, fretful pen!
Oh, dreams on seas that touch no shore!
The withered years and voiceless men
Pass on and close the door.

THE EMPTY NORTH.
The North cannot be kept empty for an indefinite
period. Something must be done. Lord -Lever-
hulme’s advice to import Asiatics is a policy of de-
spair.”—Rev. J. S. Needham, in St. Andrew’s Cathe-
dral, Sydney.
Australia has been haunted of late by a
rather intense soapboiler, who has explained
to us many things. It appears that we
should go solid for Freetrade, so that we
may prosper as Britain is doing and as Ire-
land has done from time immemorial, and
not be dead-broke like the United States ; and
we should also import the same weight and
bulk of silks and jewellery and lace and
women’s hats that we export of wheat and
wool and lead, because it is unpayable policy
for the ships to return half-empty. We
have also learned from the eminent visitor
that the wealth of the United States has
really not been made by the great manufac-
tures of the White North, where they make
Ford cars and the like, but by the humble
nigger cotton-picker in the South; wherefore
we should go and do similarly. And the
lordly sojourner has discoursed much about
the dangers of our Empty North, which he
wishes to fill with a garrison of ignorant and
non-combatant colored folk—if they were
any other sort of colored folk they would
take the North as soon as a fair number of
them were imported, and keep it for them-
selves. In fact, the windows of Heaven
have been opened, and it has rained advice.
There has been no lack of rejoinder, of
course. Politicians like Pkatten have told
the honored visitor that Australia is going
to be kept white just the same, and pastors
like Needham, quoted above, have said that
something must be done. The misfortune is
that the White Australia crowd is a feeble,
fitful congregation, without half the direct-
ness of its opponents. The black-labor lot
simply want to lift the barrier and let the
colored multitude in, under indenture, or
promiscuously, or both ways, and the colored
multitude, being just across the way, is wait-
ing to come. Equally simple and obvious
devices for attracting white settlement exist,
but even if they are shouted by megaphone
in the ear of the professional patriot his
general answer, if there is any answer, is
Asquith’s historic “Wait and see.” Also
he says that the question is a very big one,
and that “heroic measures” are to be depre-
cated, and that it is necessary to proceed
along strictly constitutional lines, which
somehow always seem to be perpendicular
and inaccessible lines, when they don’t actu-
ally overhang. Meanwhile in England a
Government has arrived which is likely to
abandon the'Singapore naval base, and leave
the hegemony of the Western Pacific to
colored folk, and which says plainly that it
takes no interest in White Australia. At
the same time White Australia has vanished
out of the local Bolshevik Labor objective,
and it has become possible for an aggressive
trades-union leader in this country to declare
against it and still retain his leadership.
* * * *
If a tide of any sort is moving in North
Australian affairs there is a serious possi-
bility that it is moving in the wrong direc-
tion. There is no end to the chance of
irredeemable disaster, by hostility from with-
out, or treason within, or both, until the
White North, as distinguished from the
Empty North, is made sufficient of an accom-
plished fact to close the argument. Some
very large doings will be necessary to bring
this about, and the first essential is that the
people who babble about getting white popu-
lation in the North, and attempt nothing but
the negative policy of keeping black popula-
tion out, should recognise what these
doings are. A party with no pro-
gramme at all gets nowhere. To have a
goal in view without the ghost of a definite
scheme for reaching it is merely a matter of
pious aspiration, which is equivalent to a
general craving for Zion, or the moon, or the
Millennium. Three practical steps which
may be specified are these: —
(1) The establishment of a standard-gauge South-
to-North railway—the line which is a leading feature
of the long-delayed and much side-stepped agreement
of over a dozen years ago.
(2) The establishment of a system of freeholds in
the Territory, wicn whatever precautions may he
considered necessary against the aggregation of mon-
ster estates.
(3) The creation of at least two new States m
Tropical Australia to begin with.
To which some thoroughly sound patriots
would add:—
(4) The abolition of the Canberra Federal capital,
and the establishment of an Australian metropolis in
the tropics, where the metropolis of a white tropical
Commonwealth should be if the people intend to
show that a white tropical settlement is possible,
and is not a silly delusion to be jeered at.
People who never get beyond pious yearnings
may say that even Nos. 1, 2 and 3 constitute
an impossible programme; but at least it is
a programme, and probably the only definite
one on the market. Its impossibility can’t be
proved unless a strong and definite effort is
made to carry it out. At the worst it is
better than the familiar and helpless wail
that “something must be done.”
* * * *
The railway is included because, as already
mentioned, it is specified most definitely in
the bond, and breach of faith isn’t supposed
to bring success, a matter of which eminent
clergymen who preach in cathedrals are well
aware. Another reason is that railways are
a recognised method of shifting troops and
war material, as well as settlers, machinery,
produce and sundries. This applies especi-
ally to inland districts (and the best parts
of the N. Territory are inland) where the
Government auxiliary craft Ilachel Cohen
can’t go, even if that ill-starred ark hadn’t
been lately reduced to ashes. The basis of
the freehold proposition is that the desire
for actual ownership, to say nothing of the
desire for a flutter in land values, appears
ineradicable, and that the small leasehold
seems to attract hardly anybody and to make
a permanent settler of nobody. As far as
can be seen there won’t be time, before the
nigger comes, to teach any appreciable popu-
lation to like the tenant system. It brings
in a mere shred of revenue, whereas the sale
of farms might yield something, and a Gov-
ernment with 335,000,000 unsold acres can
afford to part with a farm or two. The idea
of turning Northern and Central Queensland
into separate States, as the beginning of a
much larger scheme of subdivision, rests on
the evidence of Australia’s past, and there
being no scrap of testimony on the other side
the evidence holds good. Wherever a State
Government and capital have been estab-
lished population has gathered in force on
and around the spot, without any wild and
reckless spending of loan money to bring in
settlers, and there has been no similar gather-
ing anywhere else. The capital may be cold
or warm ; it may be on a world-famous har-
bor, as happened to Sydney or Hobart, or it
may be a great deal too many miles up a
ditch-river, as in the case of Brisbane; it
may be dry or wet; it may be close to rich
mineral deposits or remote from them—yet
provided the place is a metropolis it becomes
a centre of population, and a starting-point
for further settlement. And starting-points
are made no other way. Rockhampton and
Townsville (or Gladstone and Bowen) might
be fast attaining to the dimensions of Bris-
bane and Adelaide but for the greed or
apathy of politicians who say that their
city, itself the result of Separation, is a
great place, and that they don’t want any
more like it. The whole secret of stagnation
and failure and mysterious paralysis is that
even the men who live and have their notori-
ety by their sham devotion to the ideal of a
White North declare by their actions that
tropical Australia and the upper 400 miles of
temperate Australia are too hot and un-
healthy for a white legislator to pass bills
in. Wherefore Tories and globe-trotters and
soapboilers laugh White Australia out of
court —and with reason.
BRITISH LABOR AND THE
COMMONWEALTH.
An unpleasant truth which Australia can-
not face too soon is that it is by no means
popular with the workers of Britain. A
vague dislike of the overseas dominions has
been a tradition with radicalism in the
United Kingdom for generations. We stand
for many of the policies that the Liberal-
Labor section most distrust —notably Protec-
tion and an aggressive form of nationalism.
English immigrants have not been cordially
received in some quarters here, and the most
unpleasant incidents have been recorded, and
exaggerated, by the English press. Above
all, we have had the misfortune to be
adopted by the other side. Our offence is
complete in the eyes of many from the mere
fact that we have won the approbation of
the London Morning Post and the
National Review. The A.I.F. was the
innocent means of exacerbating the Lib-Lab’s
traditional hostility to the hard-fighting,
hard-borrowing, flag-waving, nigger-spurning
white units of the Empire. The Diggers
were made much of, not to say spoiled, by
rich English people who did little or nothing
for the much more necessitous Tommies.
Wherever the highly-paid Dominion troops
went they sent up the prices of the little
luxuries that mean so much to soldiers on
active service, and the British rankers were
the chief sufferers. W. M. Hughes went
out of his way to associate Australia with
High Toryism, and Prime Minister Bruce
followed suit during the late elections. And
now Toryism appears to be as dead as
Ivaiserism. The altered situation is bound
to have a serious' effect on Australia’s world
position; and the change comes at a crisis
in history.
* * * *
In the days when Britain was an island,
not only geographically but for purposes of
defence—the R.N. was then supreme in all
the seas, and British credit stood second to
none—it was an obvious and innocuous piece
of strategy for a great political party to
make a plank of Jingoism. The Tories could
safely defy anyone to attack the Dominions,
for no foreign nation would have been so
mad as to do so. The position now is that
the balance of power, which did so much
for so many years to keep the peace on the
Continent, is gone. Relatively to the rest of
the Western World France is more power-
ful in all but wealth than it was in the time
of Louis XIV., when Spain had begun to
decline, Sweden was exhausted and Germany
and Austria dismembered. She is supreme
in the air, as well as on land, and, as was
the case in the 17th century, is capable of
giving a good account of herself on the sea.
Britain has nothing in the way of territory
that France needs. But a number of dis-
ruptive influences are at work which threaten
to destroy the understanding come to between
the two nations in face of the menace of
an arming Germany, and the closer bond
which was formed on the battlefield. French
and English, as Hamerton pointed out half
a century ago, are naturally antipathetic:
they have been at loggerheads for so many
centuries that veiled hostility has become a
habit with majorities on both sides of the
Channel. Nothing uncovers latent hostility
so effectually as financial indebtedness; and
France, the thrifty, business-like nation
which, above all others on the Continent,
aspires to be regarded as an “honest broker,”
owes Britain more money than she can pay
—or more, anyhow, than she means to pay
for the time being. But perhaps the most
perilous factor in the case of a proud race
like the French, who have just recovered
their prestige as fighters after 50 years of
shameful eclipse, is their military predomi-
nance. A nation easily persuades itself that
the forcible spread of its particular culture
is for the benefit of humanity. The British
Empire has been taking up the “white man’s
burden” for generations with that ideal in
view, to the annoyance of Indians, Egyp-
tians and other pacifist peoples. Italy’s
“sacred egoism,” Pan-Germanism, Pan-Islain-
ism, Japanese and American Imperialism
were, or are, all expressions of the same
theory. The French claim that they are in
the Saar, amongst other things, for the bene-
fit of the inhabitants, and they go further
than Britain lias ever gone as regards Egypt,
and affirm that when the referendum pro-
vided for by the Versailles Treaty is taken,
the Saar natives will declare for French as
against German administration and culture.
Now, British Labor is dead against France’s
policy in Germany; and as for the promi-
nent Liberals in the Cabinet, whose influence
is expected to be on the side of moderation,
Lord Haloane is aggressively pro-German,
while Lord Parmoor is the author of many
bitter pamphlets protesting against the
administration of the occupied regions. On
the other hand, the French have not the re-
motest intention of relaxing their hold on
Germany. A sentence from a leading article
by Senator Gaston ,Tapy in a current Echo
de Paris provides the Icit motif of thou-
sands of pronouncements that are being made
all over France to-day:—
it is intolerable, after the sacrifices of France and
England, that our enemies, though beaten in war,
should by means of fraudulent German manoeuvres,
triumph in peace, arid, with their industries, mercan-
tile marine and commerce freed of all imposts, be-
come masters of the world.
Here is a situation that might involve Bri-
tain in another war, or an almost equally
fatal climb-down, and if either comes to
pass what is to happen to Australia?
There is no difference whatever between
the motives, methods and morals of a nation
and those of the average adult male within
the nation. Every virile race wants to be
rich and powerful, and has thought out ways
and means of achieving its ends, which it is
only debarred from putting into operation by
the national equivalent of a police force.
There are, of course, saints in every society,
scrupulously upright folks who would not
take a mean advantage of a neighbor, how-
ever urgent their need happened to be; and
similarly there are pacifists in every nation
who would rather see their fatherland perish
in want and ignominy than go to war for its
requirements. But the majority are preda-
tory animals who look on a rich fool as a
fit object to provide them with money, and on
an unarmed country with valuable natural
resources as a place designed by Providence
for the application of militarism. Aus-
tralia, except for the glorious period be-
tween the birth of the R.A.N. and the death
of the A. 1. 1., has played the part of a casual
and somewhat inept youth whose vast posses-
sions would be at the mercy of any stranger
of an acquisitive turn of mind but for the
protecting hand of a heavy parent in the
shape of British Toryism. With the noisy
old Empire party in total eclipse, and with
men at Downing-street who in the field of
foreign affairs are reluctant to bluff much
less fight, the Commonwealth is entering on
an entirely new phase. We may be called
on, for example, in the near future, to main-
tain the White Australia doctrine, of which
both Liberalism and Internationalism
strongly disapprove. To yield a point on
such an issue would only mean fresh de-
mands, leading along a fore-ordained road to
national death. The other alternative is to
put ourselves in a position, militarily,
navally and financially, to talk resistance
w’hen the time comes, as come it inevitably
must.
THE STEEL GUITAR.
About 15 years ago a young Hawaiian was
amusing himself by playing a guitar when,
unthinkingly, he picked up a piece of steel
and found that, by running it back and
forth upon the strings, a sound was pro-
duced that both interested and pleased him.
His subsequent experiments led to the de-
velopment of the steel guitar. The natives
of Hawaii had always been a music-loving
and musically-gifted people, playing upon
many of the instruments of the Old World,
and playing, too, upon the instrument that
was peculiarly theirs, the ukulele. But
upon the advent of the steel guitar these
were cast into the background. The new
guitar became the characteristic Hawaiian
instrument. To be sure, others were suc-
cessfully learned and played by the islanders.
The ukulele remained in general use. But
thoughts of the guitar and its haunting airs
soon became inseparably coupled with
thoughts of Hawaii.
The invention of this new method of play-
ing the guitar may seem to have been a
mere accident and its popularity but a
vogue. I think, however, that it has a
deeper significance. Prior to the advent of
the white man, Hawaii held a race of people
promising in many ways, unique in some,
and absolutely delightful. Food on their
islands was plentiful, so that they had never
learned the hard lessons of hunger, nor had
they developed the harsh characteristics of
a struggling community. All was accepted
with a childlike trustfulness. Climatic con-
ditions were the most generous, teaching
these people that life was an easy and very
pleasant game. Their instincts were kindly,
joyous, singing instincts. They sang, and
their songs were as the songs of birds. They
danced, and their dances were like the frolics
of happy children who had learned with
candor naive and unashamed the lesson of
sex. Of all the Polynesian peoples they
knew the least of war. Beauty was then
normal atmosphere, trustfulness their out-
look. . , , . ,
Then came the white man with his Bible
and his rum, his schemes and his greed. How
was this trustful, singing population to com-
bat him? How was it to fathom his schemes
or anticipate his treachery and greed? The
Hawaiian contemplated him with wonder-
ment and then with dismay. Food strangely
ceased being plentiful, and, for the first time,
the natives knew hunger and want. They
were taught that the scanty dress in which
of old they had revelled, delighting in the
contour of the human form, was insufficient
and indecent. They were taught to want not
only clothes but many other things _ which
could be procured only by that magic sub-
stance, money. And so their lazy gaiety gave
place to a life of work, and the whip of the
modern slave-driver taught them intimida-
tion. Thus they wondered and were dis-
tressed.
After a while cities miraculously appeared,
and many of the Hawaiians. found them-
selves, quite unaccountably, living in little
square boxes that cramped their bodies and
strove to cramp their spirits. And factories
came—marvellous structures that caused
more intimidation. And big ships swam in
and took some of the people away; and
the Chinese, those peculiar people who
w r orked in the fields from early dawn to dark,
came in amazing numbers. Later on the
Japanese, too, and they acted like the white
men. Everywhere the Hawaiian saw his
beautiful garden turned into a workshop, and
with a pain at heart lie realised that the
workshop was not his.
For the Hawaiians, as a people, found no
place in this new order. They could not,
like the Japanese, mimic the hustling white
man. They had no aptitude for that pro-
longed labor and perseverance which won
for the Chinese their place in the islands.
They did not even take greatly to the vices
of the white man. Nor did they feel the fire
of rebellion as other subjected people have.
Their bodies were made for ease and for
the joys of simple dances. Their hearts were
tuned to beauty and soft harmony. Their
souls w T ere like the souls of little children
who have always danced and played and sel-
dom fought or struggled. These islands had
been their plavground, but now they were
a workshop, and in it the natives had no
place. They were not even a problem. They
were simply ignored.
But still there was a song in the hearts
of the natives, and still there was wistfulness
there. They had no political leaders. They
had no mouthpiece to give voice to their
yearnings or to their despair. So they made
songs, and much of that spirit found voice in
their songs; but words could only suggest it.
and songs seemed very clumsy. They had
the ukulele, and it had filled their needs
quite well before this new emotion came; but
now it, too, was insufficient. They had the
instruments of the outer w r orld, many of
which made charming sounds; but none gave
voice to what w r as in their hearts. In an
atmosphere of hopelessness, a race of men
and women was bursting with a wistful, a
pitiable longing for beauty and care-free
joy, but they could find no voice for its
expression.
That young Hawaiian with liis fragment
of steel and his guitar really discovered a
voice through which a race could speak its
longing and despair. The music of other
races lias been played upon the Hawaiian
steel guitar, and no doubt it has sounded
well, but it has never seemed to harmonise
with the instrument. The music of Hawaii


has been played on other instruments, but
they have never seemed to fit the music.
There has alwmys been something which
the music wished to say that the instrument
could not quite utter. But let a true son
ot Hawaii play his own native music upon
the steel guitar, and the guitar will sing. It
Avill become almost articulate. 111 long,
slurred, droning notes, notes that linger in
sweetness as the lover lingers over his fare-
well kiss, notes that droop with a lament
as if the lover kneAv he could not ever return
but is Avistful, clinging to hope—in such
eloquent tones this instrument will speak the
spirit of the race whose name it bears.
The apparent accident that led to the dis-
covery was really the result of the search-
ing of the unconscious mind of the race for
a medium through w’hich it could express
its new-found emotion. The Hawaiians
seized upon it so suddenly and made it theirs
so completely because it and it alone ex-
pressed that emotion to the full. So from
almost every dwelling-place where Hawaiians
live on those once beautiful islands, now
being made ugly by slums and factories, there
rises at nightfall the voice of a race: a thin,
sweet, wailing song—a song of wistful long-
ing in an atmosphere of despair.
LESTER WAY.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Search for Paradise.
Ramsay Macdonald is about to begin the
unpleasant process of disillusionment. He
piously aims at the abolition of unemploy-
ment pay (now’ about £50,000,000 per
annum), to be brought about by the states-
manlike process of making it unneces-
sary ; also lie wants to do the necessary
and thing with the housing pro-
blem. Noav, these matters have not
been wholly neglected in the past; and the
result has not always been wdiat w r as anti-
cipated. Lloyd George, in his first Budget
(1909), lay in wait for the builder, and
heavily taxed the profit made by the sale
of houses; likewise he ivent baldheaded for
Unearned Increment. Building before that
time had been rather overdone for a while,
and it was reckoned that one-twelftli of the
existing domiciles were then empty. But
after that it diminished, not AA’holly owing
to w’hat AA’as done, but partly because of
what was vaguely but fiercely foreshadowed,
and by 1914 there were signs of scarcity.
Later there Avere more signs. In 1915 rents
w’ere fixed at the pre-war standard, Avhere-
upon the stoppage became practically com-
plete. In these circumstances the State in
1919 took a hand in earnest, and local bodies
put on a spurt, though some of them had been
m the house-building line for many years.
The London County Council is, in fact, the
biggest landlord in London. Yet some people
have gone so far as to speculate whether it
wouldn’t liai’e been better worth while to
arrest the slump in manufactures even by
abandoning Freetrade, inasmuch as the sudden
rush of cheap houses, like the rush of cheap
imported clothes, doesn’t seem to have helped
the poor much. Ram,say Macdonald hasn’t
explained his plan, if he has a plan, but
possibly it is connected in some way with
the proposed levy on capital. What recep-
tion he Avill get remains to be seen. It is a
deplorable fact that in some city localities
the people simply Avant more homes, and
Avould consider better ones as something of
a bore, regarding better drink, or more for
the same money, as preferable. Glasgow,
which is generally quoted as the last British
w 7 ord in the Avay of bad housing, really shows
very little sign of discontent on that account.
It is addicted to dark, four-storey tenements,
one approached by a common entry and
stair, and the other stationed behind and
approached by a commoner entry, which is
reached through the first common entry. In
other w’ords, they flock in pairs. There may
be 16 or 20 domiciles in a tenement, includ-
ing some underground, and the rent of the
topmost and backmost and w’orst one used
to be, in some instances, as low’ as 2s. 6d. per
week and taxes. Taxes included poor rates.
Talk of the expropriation of the ground landlord
has little interest for the inhabitants, except
as a matter of principle, for each person’s
share in him is represented by a very small
amount of whisky per week. Even in the
time of high w’ar-wages there was no per-
ceptible revolt against the old peaceful Avay
of life. Yet Glasgow has had, for at least
50 years, a municipal department devoted to
the improvement and reconstruction of the
city; and the present position there
isn’t hopeful for a Prime Minister who has
to take all England, Scotland and Wales in
his stride. One trouble is that something
else besides good nearly always proceeds out
of these schemes of reform. The Lloyd
George scheme is a case in point. The
reason why the busy little man arrived so
suddenly like a shark falling out of a clear
sky is said to have been What Happened To
Gorringe. Gorringe paid a few hundreds per
annum to the Duke of Westminster for
the ground on w’hich his shop w’as erected.
When his lease w’as expiring he was in-
formed that he could have a renewal if he
paid £4OOO a year rent, made the Duke a
present of £50.000, and put up palatial new’
premises, to be forfeited to the Duke w’hen
the new lease expired. Lashing out with the
tail of the Welsh Dragon at this iniquity.
Lloyd George only grazed his Grace, but he
scared the small house-maker badly. And the
result was such that at one time the compul-
sory taking in of lodgers was seriously advo-
cated. The difficulty is that life is such a
complex affair —the life of the slums as much
as the life of the palace. Ramsay Mac-
donald’s country, from the condition of
which he presumably gets his inspiration,
is. for example, a place of small houses and
large distilleries. Just before the war there
were 142 distilleries in the United Kingdom,
and 113 of them were in Scotland. It wrns
in a great Scotch city in those happy days
that an Australian, exploring the by-ways
on a Sunday, remarked in wonderment to
her chauffeur that five out of every seven
women seemed to be drunk. To which Angus
Mcßrose replied genially; “You come along
in a couple of hours, ma’am, and the other
two will ha\ r e repaired the oversight.” By
all the rules, the improvement of the housing
ought to improA-e the people; but experience
suggests that the, reformer who thinks it
AA-ill make all the difference is going to be
bitterly disappointed.
Cotton and Costs.
Queensland has a Producers’ Association,
and the Dalma Scrub cotton-growing branch
of it makes this contribution to the tremen-
dously important.- question whether Australia
(and especially Northern Australia) is to
have another industry :
The A.W.L T . is ‘claiming through the Arbitration
Court a wage of £4 10s. per week of 44 hours and
keep for cotton pickers, and £3 10s. and keep for
employees engaged in clearing and preparing land
for cotton. Allowing £1 per week for keep (it is
very doubtful Avhtjther the class of food and accommo-
dation demanded, by the union can be supplied for
£1) the wage amounts to 2s. 6d. per hour for
cotton picking and a little over 2s. per hour for
other work. Detailed below is what the cost of pro-
duction of cotton will be if this wage has to be
paid; and Australia can judge for itself the fate
of the industry.
The details of the cost of production as here set
forth Avere not compiled by one grovrer. They Avere
discussed arnd agreed upon at a special general
meeting ot the Producers’ Association held for the
purpose, and are published by the Association as
the cost of cotton production in Dalma Scrub, if
the A.W.U. claim is granted.
From these figures it is seen that to produce and
handle a 10001 b.-to-the-acre croj? of cotton off an
area of 15 acres at the rate of A\?age and under the
conditions claimed by the A.W.U. Avill cost £33 Is.
per acre. The total value of the cotton produced at
sd. per lb. is £2O 16s. Bd. The grower Avould
thus be losing £l2 4s. 4d. per acre.
The cost is divided into three sections :■—

The folloAving is an extract from a resolution
carried by the meeting:—
That the cotton-growers of the Dalma Scrub Loc.ll
Producers’ Association are emphatically of tire opinion
that the fixing of an aAA'ard for the cotton industry
should be held oA’er for at least tAvo years to en-
able the cotton industry to ljccome securely estab-
lished, and strongly urge the District Councils and
Council of Agriculture of the Queensland Producers’
Association to take all possible action to attain
tins end.
The following resolution Avasi also carried:—
That this L.P.A. advocates paying lid. per lb.
for cotton picking, 75 per cenjt. to be paid as work
progresses, and the remaining' 25 per cent, on the
completion of the contract; this payment to he
made on the understanding thrit the area is picked
in a dry, clean and workmanlike manner.

Lenin ami Rollespierre.
Lenin, the Robespierre of the Russian Re-
volution, has gone to Ms' account. He was
luckier than RobuspierEre, and his ascend-
ancy lasted longer , but in other respects his
history closely uvsembles that of the Sea-
green Incorruptible. Each was a merciless
fanatic, the god of whose idolatry was a
doctrinaire —Rousseau in Robespierre’s
case; Marx in Lenin’s. Endowed with the
gift of the gab and with a reputation for
probity, each 'became the darling of the city
mob. Raised by the mob’s favor to a fore-
most place in the Revolution, each sought to
ram the theo rics of his favorite writer down
the nation’s throat. Lenin’s opportunities
were, of course, greater than thosie of “the
pure-mindcrl lawyer from Arras,” and his
Extraordir ary Commission is computed to
have removed 15 or 20 times more unbelievers
of the riev,- gospel than Robespierre’s Revolu-
tionary ■'Tribunal —flic, latter’s briskest guil-
lotine re cord was a mere 1285 heads in six
weeks. I Jut, generally speaking, their methods
were identical, and so were their results.
Rousseauism fell in France ; Marxism has
been abandoned in Russia. The Muscovite
Revolution, like the Gallic, was started by
the m iddle-class and captured by the city
proletariat. It has lasted till now only be-
cause (1) the Allies defeated Germany in
1918 (but for that \Russia would now’ be a
German colony), and (2) the land w r as
take n from the noMes and divided among
the/ peasants. Thereupon the peasants fought
for* the Red Government against the aristo-
cratic Koltchakb, Denekins and Wran-
ciHls, wdio would liav<e restored the earved-
uf) estates to the fiormter owners, just as the
French peasants fooightt for the Jacobin Gov-
ernment against tine emigres and the foreign
armies that supported their cause. Peasant
proprietorship, the one, enduring achievement
of the French Revolution, will probably be
the one enduring achievement of the Russian
Revolution. Yet nothing was farther from
the intentions of the dead Lenin. His object
in sanctioning the division of the land was
to establish Coramunisim in agriculture; but
the peasants rejected Coommunism, even as
the French peasants rejected the fantastic
measures imposed on them by the Paris dema-
gogues AA'hose beads wore full of Rousseau,
It is one of t he ironies of history that the
French prolet mat got nothing out of their
Revolution sa re the imperishable infamy of
th& crimes cc /mmittetf, during their ascend-
ancy, whereas the peasantry got the land and
became the most powerful and most conserva-
tive section of the French people. And the
same effects are arriving in Russia. Scoun-
drels have enriched themselves during the
dictatorship of the proletariat, and ruffians
have exercised the power of life or death, but
the fruits of the doomed experiment as regards
the toiling masses are enormous misery and
bloodshed, and the odium thereof. On the
other hand, the peasants have become men
of property, and are destined, as in France,
to be the power behind that “capitalistic
imperialism” which is the Communist’s pet
aversion. In the ordinary relations of life
Lenin, like Robespierre, seems to have
been a decent and likeable character. It bas
never been alleged against either that he
was a corrupt impostor like Barras, or an
insatiable sensualist like Trotsky, or that
he loved cruelty for its own sake, like the
butchers of the Terror and the Cheka. But
the career of each blood-bedabbled dreamer
shows how mad and bad a thing it is to
ignore human nature, human experience and
evolutionary processes, and try to run a
country according to fixed ideas derived from
books.
*
Russia and the Australian Farmer.
“Chant Pagan,” who stayed behind when
the war was over:—
It is time Australia and Maoriland began to realise
hoAV this Russian business is going to affect them.
Not politically. That side of it has been threshed
out until it is doubtful if anyone now reads the
Russian “news” in the papers. But economically, in
this way. Ninety per cent, of the Russian people
are peasants. That is, they are either farm-folk or
have something to do with farming. They are almost
all unable to read and write. And they are totally
non-political in the sense that we understand
political. But they have got all the land, and they
have got it for nothing. They pay neither rent to
an owner nor interest on a “monkey.” They pay
no rates, for the reason that they have got none of
those things for which we pay rates. And they pay
no taxes, for the reason that very few can be
gathered—the most .valuable thing millions of them
own is the big oven on top of which they sleep.
Now, Avhat is going to happen to the price of farm
produce when they get reorganised and start putting
it on the AVorld market in the same way as they did
before the war, they lacking those big overhead
charges anti being able to produce at a cost Avhicli
leaves us hopeless ? And they are being quickly
organised, thanks to German aid.
The Avay things went was something like this. The
Bolshies were the smallest political party. But they
.had the advantage that they spoke a common idiom
ot political shibboleths that was understanded of
all. They made a coup , d’etat, and it was a case of
vae victit ; the vie Us in the case being their fellow-
townsmen of other political opinions. They then
went along to the peasants, to whom any head of
the State is just that and nothing more, and they
said: “The land is common.” (Bravo.) “It belongs
to the people, to all of us.” (Loud bravos.) “It
belongs to you.” (Bravissimos.) So far good; but
they then tried to make it clear to the farmers that
they must work the laiid for the common good, and
feed the Avliole of the population by their efforts.
But that \A-as an apple off another tree. The farmers
said “Oh, no. The land belongs to the people.
There is plenty of it. You come along and take
your share of it, and groAV your own food.” And
that, without any organisation, or forethought, or
effort, put the Bolsheviks to the pack. For the Bol-
sheviks are all townsmen, mostly industrialists. Many
of them hate country life like poison, aud look doAvn
on the countryman as a “boob.” Others kiw
nothing about it. Others are in Bolshevism for Avliat
they can get out of it, or to satisfy revenge, or for
the thousand and one reasons that send men to join
political parties. But they are all quite united in
being most umvilling to go and groAV their oavh
Avheat, spuds and mutton. Noav, in the late war
there Avere all the sorts of government that have
ever been invented, but there Avas not one of them
that kneAv hoAv to prevent the secretive farmer from
eating as much as he liked of stuff of his oavu groAV-
ing, or to make him groAV as much as he could —
nothing Avill do that except self-interest, patriotism
or religion. lloAvever, they tried hard, but they
failed. Farm folk are secretive; and they have big
areas at their disposal the ins and outs of vvhich
only they know, and Avhich it is impracticable for a
stranger to search. I have lived on the fat of the
land on an English farm, when the toAvnsfolk were
starving for fat and sugar. I Avas on the march
through Belgium to Germany after the Armistice, and
I always found that, if the farm folk learned I Avas
one of them, then all sorts of things mysteriously
appeared for me to eat. Things like rabbits, and
pork, arid eggs, and mushrooms, and eels, and fish.
I was in Austria Avhen Vienna Avas being fed at
gigantic cost by America, yet, by keeping to the
country districts, and not being too “flash,” I
managed to do fairly well.
And so the Bolshies have found that it is neces-
sary to revise, their creed. No doubt it was a very
good creed; but it “don’t always act proper.”
Meantime the peasants have got all the land —not
only their own share, but also that which the towns-
men will not and cannot work. The only thing they
know is that they are going to stick to it. And
the Bolshies have also taught them that it is wrong
to pay rent of interest, and that was a thing the
smallest intellect quickly grasped. So it is found
that the only way to make the farmers work and
sell is to inoculate them Avith a Iwant for luxuries,
a thing hard to do with a people who are naturally
frugal and lazy. It is said that the farmers want
ploughs, implements, etc. So they do; but the Rus-
sian farmer is not far behind his fellows in other
countries in the invention of makeshifts, and he is
quite ready to potter about, growing just enough to
feed himself. To work hard to get a neAV plough to
grow more to feed other people doesn’t appeal to
him at once. Still, the Germans are at work, and
iii this business of organisation they are pastmasters.
If Russia produced all it could, at a price which
Avould satisfy the non-rentpaying, non-interest-pav-
ing, non-ratepaying, incredibly cheap-living peasant,
no other wheat-exporter to Central and Western
Europe could live against the competition. But the
surplus, though large, is not colossal, though it will
inevitably grow, and perhaps grow A’ery rapidly.
And that is Avhy England will not grant Protection
to cereal foodstuffs. The leaders of English public
opinion (the powers behind the throne who direct
mass psychology Avithout the mass knoAving it) no
doubt already foresee the time when they Avill be
able to take advantage of Communist doings in
Russia, and buy wheat at half a crown a bushed
and butter at a shilling a pound.
But where do Australia and Maoriland come in?
_
The Honorable Member.
The appalling ignorance of some politicians,
not to mention the appalling manners of
others or the same politicians, has led to an
occasional demand that every candidate
should be required to show that he. had
passed an examination in at least the fringes
or outskirts of certain necessary subjects. He
should know some political economy, it being
a subject which deals with loans, national
bankruptcy, irredeemable and other paper
money, banking, insurance, deficits and sink-
ing funds. He should know enough Austra-
lian law to save him from making laws that
are made already, and be acquainted, with
some history. The worst elements in the
worst House that Australia possesses took
no notice till a N. S. Wales country Labor
league put the matter on its programme, and
then there was an awakening, which iucluded
some at least of the kind of member that it
is most necessary to get rid of. Several said
that the idea was absurd, if not impossible,
unless voters were also required to pass a
test. A number fled for refuge to that silly
idea, which is equivalent to saying that doc-
tors should not be required to pass a test
unless all prospective patients pass a
test also. Nevertheless, as a matter of fact,
the need of an educational test for electors is
becoming very evident; and in addition to
the weeding out of the grossly ignorant voter
the necessity for the weeding out of the
criminal voter is evident also. There was
the usual plea by the member (it was Cann,
M.L.A., this time) who “had to go to work
when he was 12,” and who said that “it
would not be fair to impose such a test on
candidates who had not had the advantages
of a good education in their young days.” If
the salary of the politician is everything, and
the good government of the country is
nothing, it would not be fair. But the indi-
vidual who missed his early training has to
find the necessary qualifications somewhere
in later life before he can become a doctor,
dentist, barrister, solicitor, actuary, State
teacher, chemist, attendant on sick cows, and
in some countries before he can be a town
clerk or a property agent. And that takes
no account of architects, surveyors or even
policemen. If Cann, M.L.A., hasn’t used, or
won't use, the leisured and well-paid ease of
so many Parliamentary recesses to read up
for a fairly simple examination, then it is
time he Avas written off as lacking in the
mind or the industry for his position. It Avas
pleaded, of course, amid the rally of injured
and indignant politicians, that bad charac-
ters don't last in the Legislature, being found
out and, at the ensuing election, shot out. But
a growing idea is that it is the best men who
don’t last, because they can’t endure the
Avorst men’s language and habits, and that
the only reason why part of the present
assemblage isn’t in gaol is that one member
can’t proceed against another for criminal
libel so long as he only misbehaves inside
the House —the one place where man can
be the whole hog with impunity. (If this
absurd “privilege” was abolished criminal
proceedings AA’ould naturally follow; for the
civil law, Avith its wearying lack of finality,
has become too expensive.) The right of an
ignorant and roAvdy electorate, possibly with
a strong criminal taint, to elect and retain
a member of its own sort would be indubi-
table if he governed only his own constitu-
ency, or, in other words, if every member sat
and legislated and interrupted by himself.
But as the M.L.A. for Push Hills runs every
other constituency just as much as he runs
Push Hills, other constituencies have a right
of complaint. It isn’t to be supposed that
an educational- test would completely elimi-
nate the hopeless vulgarian, but the acquisi-
tion of knowledge and the love of knowledge
are such refining influences that it Avould
shift the great bulk of him.

The Inevitable Tariff.
It is depressing to have to admit that the
British position greAV worse in 1923. Im-
ports Avere £95,000,000 more than in the pre-
vious year, for the Hun is crawling all over
the British market again. Exports of Brit-
ish-made goods Avere £10,000,000 less, partly
because there was less to export, partly be-
cause the Hun is crawling all over Dominion
markets as well. Under the absurd “pre-
ference” arrangement any article of which
the workmanship is one-quarter British and
three-quarters Hun comes into Australia as
British and gets preference. It is believed
that goods which are four-quarters Hun are
coming in freely under fraudulent British
marks, and also getting preference. British
imports last year were £273,000,000 more
than the exports, and as J. Bun, hasn’t the
income from foreign investments that he once
had the situation is difficult. If the
£273,000,000 of excess imports, which ex-
plain the extent to which .LB. has lost con-
trol of his oAvn British market, were replaced
by real British-made goods, the unemployed
would be working overtime, and the
£50,000.000 a year of pauper relief would
be saved. The transfer of that heap of Avork
from foreign factories to native ones was
the Avliole gospel of Baldwin at the election ;
but complications arose. The majority of
the people, including a great many of the
Labor party, probably believe that strenu-
ous Protection would save the situation; but
the Jack Jones section would hate to have
it saved that way. This shouting end of
the narty wants the capital levy. above all
things, though on that question the thinking
end is already full of doubts. It begins to be
apparent that if there Avas a levy and a
forced sale of factories, mines, castles and
estates to pay it, Yankees, wdio seem to own
all the world’s spare wealth, would be the
only possible buyers, and they would get the
goods fairly cheap in the absence of com-
petition. If the Yankees didn’t come in and
purchase England, the levy might break
things up a great deal and produce little,
and what it did produce would be more or
less balanced by the decline in next year’s tax
returns. Then Protection Avould probably
come, being more badly required than ever.
It appears to be merely a matter of having
Protection without the levy or Protection
after the levy, unless revolution comes in-
stead. The party’s craving to “recognise”
Russia certainly implies revolutionary ideas.
It isn’t a matter of resuming trade, for trade
Avas resumed a long time ago, but of holding
out the hand of friendship to a bloodstained
military despotism, and tacitly admitting its
right to repudiate hundreds of millions of
debt due to British subjects. But even if
there was first a levy, in the course of which the
Freetrade cotton-spinners of Lancashire were
sold up. and then some kind of civil commo-
tion helped by Bolshevik money and influ-

the same.
Matters in Which the Speck 1s Ahead.
Melbourne and Sydney had just begun a
chorus of indignant protest against the out-
rageous sentence of seven years given by
Justice Crisp, of Tasmania, to a maid who
laid “pinched” her mistress’s diamond ring,
when arriving Tas. dailies revealed that the
sentence was really one of seven weeks. A lot
of ill-founded as well as premature criticism
of Tas. criminal law and its administration
featured the outcry. Actually in that domain
Tas. not only need fear no comparison with
sister States, but may even teach them a
few salutary principles and methods. Thus
in this recent case the maid had pleaded
guilty before the justices in the lower court
to an indictable offence. In such cases the
Speck’s law provides that the prisoner need
not be kept waiting until next Criminal Ses-
sions. As there is only sentence to pass,
accused may be taken before a Judge in
open court, without, however, scarlet or
ermine trappings, and without the summon-
ing of jurors, witnesses, etc. After hearing
a brief statement of the circumstances, and
inquiring (as Crisp, J., did in this case) if
anything can be said for accused, sentence is
passed. In the case under notice accused
committed the offence on January 1. She
will be through her sentence in February, by
which time, had she been a similar offender
in another State, she would be preparing,
owing to vacation and other circum-
stances, to breast the bar before scar-
let and ermine, to say nothing of
the hosts of jurors, witnesses, counsel, and
the morbid public interested in the Sessions
list. And, although pleading guilty, she
would be lucky if she received sentence before
a tired, disgusted and perhaps angry
Judge had listened for a fortnight or more
to details of crimes of every variety. Tas-
mania’s departure from old practice in this
matter is undoubtedly a forward step. On
the other hand, it clings with tenacity to
the traditions and practice of trial by jury
in cases where Not Guilty is pleaded. Tas-
manian newspapers would not dare to pub-
lish one-tenth of the comment on pending
criminal cases that sometimes appears in
mainland journals. Trial by press, instead
of trial by jury, would get no encouragement
from the public and severe discouragement
from the Bench. Nor would the Victorian
system of allowing “the Crown” to know in
advance the names of all likely jurors, with
an unlimited right of challenge, while giving
accused an eleventh- or twelfth-hour know-
ledge, with a limited number of challenges,
commend itself in the island State. Vic-
torian practice requires accused himself to
challenge. Some Vic. Judges have even
questioned his right to the assistance of his
legal adviser in challenging. Tasmanian
!Judges offer no such obstacles, and even
allow the accused’s counsel to do the chal-
lenging.

The Dearth of Good Tradesmen.
From the Sec. of the Federated Jewellers,
Watchmakers’ and Allied Trades Union of
Australia:—
I read with keen interest the article about
Trades Guilds (B. 27/12/’23). The writer drew
attention to the sorry fact that numbers of lads
sent to learn a trade never get the opportunity to
become proficient ; as one lad put it, he would
never be more than a mucker-about. But I must
challenge, so far as my knowledge goes, the follow-
ing statement: “The business of the unions is to
oppose apprenticeship.” The proportion of appren-
tices allowed in the jewellers’, watchmakers’ and
opticians’ trades is very liberal; but our union
was not satisfied with fixing the proportion only
—we tried repeatedly to have inserted in our
awards compulsory training in a technical school.
Further, we desired that at stated periods they
should be examined by a board of experts. On
every occasion we were informed that Wages Boards
had no power to include matters of this nature.
We then interviewed the Factories Department,
emphasising the necessity for such legislation. We
could get no satisfaction; the requests were con-
tinually pushed to one side. AVith reference to our
watchmaking section, we as a union were so con-
vinced of the necessity of having workmen so
trained that they would be capable of handling such
a delicate article as a watch that we called for
designs for a certificate of competency, to be pre-
sented to apprentices who had finished their term
and had passed certain examinations; but in this
endeavor, as in the others, our good intentions failed
because of no Government support and the indiffer-
ence and callousness of the employer. The fault
rests mainly with the employer. All he troubles about,
as a rule, is to get a lad to learn one branch of the
trade and specialise him in it. He does not
bother whether, when the lad has served his time,
he will be an all-round tradesman. This is ! the
result: if the fashion should change (which often
happens in our trade) and the line stops being
made, the employer decides that the man is no
more use and consequently casts him aside. Another
lad is put into his place to learn some other line.
So we get our muckers-about. It is no good the
employers trying to put the blame on other shoulders.
That they cannot find good tradesmen is undoubtedly
their own fault ; and until they decide to improve
their methods of teaching, this condition will con-
tinue to the detriment of Australian industries.

Dear Bulletin, —One more of those sketchy
and ghostlike ideas for promoting settlement
in the North (from the fertile quill of retired
Major-General Eames this time) appeared
the other day in the press, and it is under-
stood that a “movement” is forming. The
proposal is for the “inauguration” of a “com-
prehensive campaign to occupy, develop and
settle” valuable areas. The proposition is
to be “carried out on a big enough scale by
the organisation and discipline of voluntary
white migrants on army lines, and by estab-
lishing equipped community centres at
selected points, and detailing to each such
centre a trained nucleus of white settlers
and their families.” An essential is that
the show shall be carried out “on business
lines in a big enough way, with up-to-date
community centres, equipped with power,
light, water, sewerage, and those facilities
which can be obtained in most centres of
about 14,000 inhabitants.” There is more
to the same effect —in fact, there is one sen-
tence of 80 words to the same effect. The
scheme isn’t exactly New Australia, and it
isn’t exactly Kendenup, and it isn’t exactly
Paradise, and it differs from the soldiers’
hen-farm settlement at Bankstown. But I

understand in a general way that a velvet
carpet is to be laid down, or is to lay itself
down, in the wilderness; and on it are to
appear tables laden with the fruits of civilisa-
tion and the flowers of culture. It is an
idyllic picture, including the offhand allusion
to “centres of about 14,000 inhabi-
tants.” I believe there are exactly a
dozen centres of 14,000 inhabitants, apart
from capital cities and their suburbs, in all
the Commonwealth. My own ideas about
the North will, I fear, appear crude by com-
parison. I would like to shove the blanky
railway through from the South, where labor
is cheapest, and I would sell farms along
it to help pay for it, and to attract settlers.
The settlers would have to depend on horse-
power at first, and use kerosene-lamps and
drink out of the creek, and throw the slops
anywhere. When I had got 40,000 or 50.000
inhabitants I would advertise a new State
and a capital that wanted building, so that
there would be a rush of bricklayers, swind-
lers and other inhabitants. The city itself
would be Government ground, but I would
offer suburban land for sale at fl per foot,
as Private Enterprise is doing in N. S.
Wales outside Canberra, in the hope that
the supply of fools still held out. At the
other towns on the railway I would offer
land at as much as I could get. There would
be no “equipped community centres at
selected points,” like base hospitals or gather-
ings of holy monks, but prospectors, mining
sharks and company promoters who brought
in outside capital would be encouraged. In
fact, my idea is to rush things in a coarse,
low-priced sort of way, without any dashed
halo or any blamed old heavenly music in
it.—Yours, etc., Sol. Malaprop.

N. S. Wales- achieved a Labor daily last
week, and the only publication to assail it
was the Worker. Industrial troubles, like
other malign organisms, breed in darkness,
and one of the functions of an honestly-run
Labor daily should be to shed light. Only
on the assumption that every strike, just
and unjust, hopeless or otherwise, must be
beneficial and creditable to the workers, is
it possible to endorse a policy of perpetual
obscurantism. So that a permanently effec-
tive Labor paper, a paper concerned to gain
a reputation as a straight-dealer rather than
as a mere propagandist organ, would tell
Demos when he was wrong as well as ex-
pose and castigate capitalism. A suspicion
of some such tendency was one of the griev-
ances Sydney Worker had against its new
comrade. The other objection was that the
bantling had not faced the world a fully
armed warrior. Labor Papers, Ltd., has
been after the cash to fulfil this high aim
for over a decade. A good deal of the funds
have gone into Macdonell House —an attrac-
tive club for Parliamentarians and. city
Labor officials, but useless to the rank and
file of the proletariat army. And there was
still no hint or hope of the early arrival of
the paper. In these circumstances the
attempt to spike the guns of the Labor
Daily can be nothing but another mani-
festation of the discreditable blood feud
which has been raging for so long
between the Montagues and Capulets
of the workers’ movement in N. S Wales.
Macdonell House seems to care not one
straw whether or no the humble toiler in
factory or field has his case presented to
the world* Unless and until its bosses can
possess and manipulate a gramophone of
their own the whole working-class movement
is to be gagged—if they can have their way.

“Tauwarra” on Papua and the Navigation
Act:—
Papua's economic future is indissolubly connected
with the question of shipping. In pre-war days three
overseas shipping cos. found profitable employment
in the Papuan trade. Pi-eight rates were low;
planters had free access to practically every import-
ant market, and even the dwindling sandalwood and
beche-de-mer trade w-as kept alive by a subsidised
service between Thursday Island and Papuan ports.
In those days Papua was still in the pioneer stage.
The volume of trade was small; the territorial
revenue was but a fraction of what it is to-day,
and no plantation of any importance had then reached
the producing stage. In 1901-02, when Papua was
still administered by the Colonial Office, the shipping
(foreign-going) entered and cleared at Papuan ports
amounted to 97,000 tons. By 1906-07 —the first
year of Australian control —the total had increased
to 159,000 tons. From 1906 until the outbreak of
the World Wax- the record was one of steady and
consistent progress. The shipping cleared and entered
in 1913-14 amounted to 359,000 tons; the volume
of trade totalled £335,000;. territorial revenue in-
creased fourfold; the area of plantations rose from
1400 to 43,000 acres, and in every other aspect of
development the results achieved under the Australian
regime were striking. During the war years progress
was naturally retarded; but by 1919-20 the comer
had been turned, and Papua promised, in spite of low.
priees, to reward the patience of Australian inves-
tors and the bullocking labor of the small planter by
a steady and increasing flow of dividends. A more
inopportune time for imposing artificial restrictions
on Papua’s overseas trade could not possibly have been
chosen; yet this was the time selected by the
Hughes Government to proclaim the Navigation Act.
The result of the “blockade” is indicated in the
following table: —-
1919-20. 1920-21. 1921-22. 1922-23.
Overseas ship-
ping (tons) . . 59,189 67,624 74,206 77,676
Vol. of trade . . £693,222 £657,442 £525,941 £494,875
Papua to-day is in a worse position as regards ship-
ping facilities than it was in the “bad old days” of
British New Guinea, when (1901-02) 97,000 tons
shared a trade valued at £152,000 ; and it is
immeasurably worse off than it was 10 years ago,
when 359,000 tons shared a £335,000 trade. More-
over, in 1913 planters and passengers had a choice of
four routes operated by three distinct cos., while
to-day they are restricted to one line trading exclu-
sively with three Australian ports. The ostensible
objects of the Navigation Act are to foster the
development of the Australian mercantile marine,
and to secure to the Australian seaman working con-
ditions and a standard of living equal to those enjoyed
by his countrymen ashore. They are objects with
w hich no good Australian will quarrel; but if as
applied to Papua they can be gained only at the cost
of Papua’s economic ruin, the wisdom of continuing
the experiment may well be doubted.

Randolph Bedford on two critics: —
Mr. O. C. Cabot (B. 17/l/’24) is an ass and the
foal of an ass. He talks of Providence sending a
political cataclysm to blow the Government off the
Queensland Treasury benches —all other things having
failed, including bribery and four elections. I regard
myself as an Indispensable Australian no more than
I regard Mr. Cabot as a Desirable Immigrant; and
Australia’s standard of desirable immigrants is low
at that. As for “Sobretodo,” why are my proposals
for Austral-American trade “wildly impossible” ? My
proposals for Austral-American or any other foreign
trade are for reciprocal treaties cutting out British
or any other preference. American law does not for-
bid the establishment of foreign Government (or any
other kind of foreign)undertakings. “The opposition
of the gigantic food trusts” applies effectively only to
cases where railway transport is required and the
private railroad systems of the U.S. work in with the
trusts. My proposition is for the establishment of
shops in the big populations of Eastern U.S. sea-
ports—Boston, New* York, Jersey City, Baltimore and
Philadelphia—where railroad transport would be negli-
gible. “The improvement of our products” alone is
valueless. Vested meat interests in Britain give a
black eye to Australian meat, whatever its grade, and
vested interests anywhere will continue to do that
until the grow'er sells in his own shops. The man
who is really “delirious” is Mr. “Sobretodo,” who
“ventures to assert” a great deal of nothing.

It looks as though the article on “Inter-
national Copyright and the U.5.A.,” by ex-
Senator J. H. Keating, published in The
Bulletin in August last, may materially
help on the cause of Australian authors,
artists and playwrights. Recent communi-
cations from both Britain and U.S.A. show
that it has served to focus the attention of
those interested in both countries; and it is
stated —not officially yet seemingly reliably—
that the current session of Congress will
witness another attempt to bring U.S.A. into
the International Copyright Union. The
bill, it is stated, will this time leave no man-
ner of doubt on the matters particularly
referred to by the Australian ex-Senator.
With U.S. piracy of Australian works ren-
dered absolutely illegal in that country, we
may view with more equanimity the steady
flow of American books into the - Common-
wealth, and set ourselves in train to return
the compliment—or whatever it may be.

Great Britain remains the world’s most
notable example as a land of big estates.
“Who’s Who” alleges that the Duke of
Atholl “owns about 202,000 acres,” the
Duke of Sutherland “about 1,000,000 acres,’’
the Duke of Hamilton “about 157,400 acres,”
and so on. One buttress of the Freetrade
cause is the bogey that Protection may bring
more power and arrogance and increment to
the landed peerage; yet the country never
screw*s up courage to compulsorily buy them
out. so that it may have a free hand. It
disposed of the big Irish land-owners (where-
upon Ireland took to Protection at the first
opportunity), but. its own crow r d remains.
Lloyd George’s whole early life was a bitter
attack on country landlordism, which was the
only kind lie knew; and his first budget,
when he became Chancellor of the Exchequer,
contained three new and intricate land taxes
wffiich were to undermine the dukes, if it
didn’t bring them crashing to the earth. The
row* he made was so convincing that the
Peers thought the last day had come. They
threw out the Budget, and in the ensuing
scuffle their House lost its veto,, and the
taxes were passed, after all. A time, how'-
ever, came when the department which col-
lected them cost £760,000 a year, and the
yield was a little over £76,000, and then they
were abandoned amid general mirth. So the
Welshman, being no financier himself, now
toddles behind Ramsay Macdonald, perhaps
hoping that his “levy on capital” may have
better luck.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The Ramsay Macdonald Cabinet con-
tains a peer (Parmoor) who was a Conser-
vative M.P. for 14 years, another (Haldane)
who was a Liberal M.P. for 27 years, and
a third (Chelmsford) who was a Tory mem-
ber of the London County Council before he
became a Colonial Governor. Then there are
three ex-Liberal politicians (Buxton, Wedg-
wood and Trevelyan), another ex-Governor
(Olivier), an intellectual (Webb), three
members of the Coalition War Ministry
(Clynes, Henderson and Walsh), and the
least radical of all trade-union secretaries
(Thomas). Try to imagine that lot address-
ing each other as “comrade” and drinking
to the Revolution !
The war-wheat pools were officially “final-
ised” in Victoria last month, and the other
three wheat States are also busy “finalis-
ing.” But a recent Privy Council decision
suggests that the process may drag on for
years. The S.A. growers have never been
satisfied that the State Government is exempt
from responsibility for the damage done by
mice and weevils to the grain pooled in
1916-17. They financed one owner in bring-
ing a test action for damages. Counsel for
the Government urged that it could not be
liable for damages in any ease, and the ques-
tion of fact was hung up till this preliminary
legal point had been settled, as an appeal
was certain whichever way it went. It
seemed to be a toss-up, and the wheat-
owners have won it, two out of three. S.A.
Supreme Court said Government could be
liable; the High Court reversed this, and said
it couldn’t; the Privy Council has now re-
versed that, and re-established the first de-
cision. So now the case goes back to Adel-
aide to be re-tried on the practical question
of whether the Government was actually
guilty of negligence or not. The claim may
amount to anything up to two millions
sterling.
The new British Government threatens to
make some history even before it meets Par-
liament. The business which apparently
appeals to it as most urgent is the recogni-
tion of Soviet Russia. It is quite possible
to trade without accepting the other fellow
as an equal, just as it is possible to sell
bottles without marrying into the bottle-o’s
family. Previous British Governments re-
fused to go further than selling bottles : Ram-
say Macdonald proposes to do the marrying
by forgiving the Soviet for stealing an im-
mense quantity of British and French money.
Agent-General Fihelly was quickly off the
mark with a threat that Queensland may
likewise repudiate if many more remarks are
made about repudiation; and if the Mac-
donald Government, by recognition of Rus-
sia, makes repudiation respectable, how will
it be able to condemn Queensland?
Economising in Tasmania is necessarily
poor gleaning, but every little counts. The
same with taxation : no State can tax her
citizens so much higher than the State next
door as to promote an exodus of population.
Treasurer Lyons now proposes to push Tas-
mania’s limit up another 10s. a head or
thereabouts. This will omy account for
about one-third of the expected deficiency
for this year. The Commonwealth must
come to light with the other two-tliirds
(about £200.000), or Tasmania, Lyons says,
must put up the shutters. The forecast
issued by Treasurer Lyons for the period
ending June 30, 1924, is: Expenditure,
£2,695,057; revenue, £2,398,399; deficit
(1924), £296,658. To partly meet the un-
cheerful situation Lyons asks Parliament to
authorise the raising this financial year
(only five months to go) of the following
new revenue :
Income-tax, profits on property sales . . £B,OOO
Disallowance of 5 per cent U.V. and
Federal land-tax . . .. . . 20,000
Increase in companies’ rates .. .. 16,000
Increased rates on individuals .. .. 37,000
Land-tax . . . . . . . . . . 26,500
Deceased persons’ estates (say four months) 6,000
Liquor-tax (say six months) . . . . 12,000
Stamp duty on cheques .. .. ... 3,000
£128,500
And as the Lyons Government has just
stalled off a no-confidence motion and got its
financial proposals into committee by 18 to
8, it looks as if Tasmania has at last got a
Government prepared to risk the wrath of
the electors. Which is something, anyhow.
Gregory, M.11.R. for Swan, lias become in-
volved in the domestic dispute which has
divided the Westralian Cockies. After
vainly intervening as peacemaker, he
espoused the cause of the three C.P. Minis-
ters and their followers, for which offence the
Farmers’ executive will shortly declare him
“black,” or politically infected with' red rust,
ENOUGH TO GIVE ANYONE THE HUMP.
“The position is desperate,’ declared Labor-Premier Lyons in the Tasmanian House of Assembly.
"The Government, therefore, proposes to increase income, land, companies and liquor taxes and death
and stamp duties sufficiently to yield an additional £128,000.”’
THE CAMEL (with a groan): “Here, have a heart! This is the last straw!”
PBEMIER LYONS: “Not at all. You only think it is, Jehoshaphat — there’ll he lots more
before you and I get through.”
or something of the sort. An enforced con-
vert from “Liberalism,” Gregory has never
stood well with the rural organisation, and
he would have been opposed in that quarter
at the 1922 election if he hadn’t been gravely
ill. The opposition will arrive next time, and
Earle Page won’t regret it, for one.
Just when some kindly people in Eng-
land were building a bridge for Queens-
land Premier Theodore, by suggesting that
the Privy Council should be asked to
decide whether the raising of the pastoral
rents on a huge scale was in disregard of
the terms of the leases—the idea, of course,
being that Theodore would put the leases
on their old footing and disgorge the ill-
gotten money should the decision go against
him—Agent-General Fihelly waved the big-
gest stick on the premises and yelled that
“people who insist on talking of repudia-
tion” may be taught what repudiation
really is—in connection with the pending
loan-renewals, of course. Then the young
man pulled on his hat and lit out for New
York to meet Theodore and presumably tell
him to bite Uncle Sam’s ear hard.
Mclntosh, M.L.A., leader of the S.A.
Country party, and an irrigation expert, on
the position as regards dried fruits: —
In London at the present time currants are £52
a ton, sultanas £5O and lexias £4O. It costs £25
a ton to get the fruit from Port Adelaide to London;
this leaves the grower a balance of from £l5 io
£27 per ton. It is estimated that it costs £2B
per ton to produce the fruit, and that doesn’t include
interest. In other words, London sales of the best
graded fruit are returning less than the cost of
production.
Such is the condition of an industry into
which thousands of returned soldiers were
hurried by the loan-debauched Governments of
three States, regardless of whether their pro-
duce would find a market. Regardless, in-
deed, of everything except votes.
When Hughes was bidding against Labor
for the soldiers’ vote in 1919 lie scooped
the pool by the heroic offer to the legions
of a gratuity of 27} millions in the shape
of bonds, payable by the taxpayer in 1924.
Some £19,000,000 must be raised towards
shifting this dead horse in a few weeks, and
Treasurer Earle Page implores the six State
Treasurers not to rush loans on the market
till his trouble is over. His outlook is none
too cheery, even if they oblige him ; and the
prospects for those traders, manufacturers,
etc., who want accommodation are even
worse. In the war years the Government
got into the habit of holding up the banks
whenever it was short of money, and as the
plan has been continued they have to be
always prepared to buy off the bushranger.
Which leaves much less available than there
should be for the regular customers.
The futility of the pacifist notion that
nations -whose interests conflict may be made
to trust one another by mutual visits was
quaintly exposed in Sydney last week. The
Japanese warships came up the harbor using
the lead—a service survival from the period
when warships frequently entered unknown
harbors. At least two daily papers pro-
ceeded to draw the deduction that the Japa-
nese were in quest of information to be em-
ployed against the Commonwealth in war-
time. Yet anyone can learn every physical
fact about Port Jackson by expending a
few shillings on an Admiralty chart, and
Dymock’s are advertising an ‘ Australian
Directory, Comprising the Coasts from Cape
Leeuwin to Port Jackson, ’ which is a further
mine of information. The Japanese sailors
arc bound to be irritated at the inhospitable
aspersion and contemptuous of the mentality
of the papers responsible for it, while many
Australian readers who are not sailors will
doubtless take the absurdity for tact and
retain an uneasy impression that the Com-
monwealth visitors are getting ready tor an
immediate invasion via the Heads.
Scaddan, once Westralian Premier and
now Minister of Mines, and Railways, lately
spoke bitterly about Protective duties:
lie quoted an instance where the Federal Govern-
ment had added to the cost of plant imported by
the Westralian Government 50 per cent, duty, -or
which the State had to pay with borrowed money
obtained at a high rate of interest.
Westralia’s loan estimates for this year are
£4,474,065, or, say, £l3 per inhabitant.
And here arc some other figures covering the
year 1921-22: —
Average of
Westralia. Six States.
Factory wages per head .. £l9l 18 10 £179 4 10
Employees’ share of each
£lOO value of output . . 29 19 9 21 4 0
Employees’ share per £lOO

facture . . . . .. 65 1 7 52 i <
Value of output per employee 623 0 0 810 0 0
Value of output per
inhabitant . . . . 33 17 7 oS u
The unpleasant but unavoidable inference is
that the Westralian, inflated and corrupted
by heavy borrowing, has become an unsatis-
factory industrialist. Employers don't rush
to Westralia to build “plant,'’ so long as
there are other places to go to. And that s
why “plant” has to be brought 'from outside.
One of Monday’s cables mentioned “the
introduction in the French Chamber of
Deputies of a bill imposing a surtax of 20
per cent, on the bills of foreigners tempo-
rarily residing in French hotels and pen-
sions.” It will bring a grin to the faces of
the Protectionist opponents of Britain’s new
Government. One of Macdonald’s main
planks is the winning over of the Continen-
tal nations to a belief in fiscal disarmament.
But taritfism, like soldiering, is in the bone
and marrow of the French. They even have
customs barriers between their chief cities
and the country districts that supply them
with farm produce.
From the water-front: —
Sudden action has followed the Arbitration Court’s
concession of preference to the Sydney wharfies’
union, the men known as “loyalists” having been
sacked wholesale. It is the ultimate fate of all
strikebreakers, although those who helped the Gov-
ernment against the 1917 ■ holdup were told they
were patriots whose services would never be for-
gotten. An attempt was certainly made to strengthen
the “loyalists” by drafting returned soldiers pre-
pared to accept wharf work into their organisation ;
but the returned men and the “loyalists” didn t
mix well. Feeling some sort of responsibility to
those who, in spite of the 1917 promises, have been
thrown out of their jobs, the Fuller Government
found work for 48 of them—rsomething on the old
sand-shifting lines, digging mud out of Cook’s
River at Tempe to pile up a new bank ; but stand-
ing ankle-deep in mud for a bob an hour less than
the rate they had been getting is not regarded by
the men as a fulfilment of the old promises. So
there are no “loyalists” now.
“Probably the only country in the world
that insists upon its politicians passing an
education test is Uruguay, and no one ever
heard of any legislative good coming out of
that country,” says Sydney D.T., discussing
the suggestion that would-be Parliamen-
tarians should be required to pass an exami-
nation in, among other things, economics.
But wasn’t it Uruguay where, a feuf years
ago, duelling was made legal, to enable mem-
bers of Parliament to call one another to
account for personal abuse used under cover
of privilege? Uruguay at least has done
something to discourage the. luxuriance of
the language of its Davidson-McGirrs.
The Brisbane tramways were taken over
by the Government from their British owners
at no fixed price, and with no definite agree-
ment as to when a price would be fixed.
The Act merely said that the Trust would
name a tentative figure, and pay per cent,
pending settlement. This arrangement began
on January 1, 1923. No tentative value
was ever fixed, but last August, which was
some weeks late, the Trust ambled along
with a few thousands on account. When
Theodore left for England matters were still
in the air, and the Trust was late again, but
expected to amble some more one of these
days. It may be a well-intentioned female,
but its frock is always open down the back,
and it never gets the breakfast dishes washed
till after lunch.
Who is it maintains this class-conscious-
ness which is alleged to he such a curse of
modern times —at the bottom, for one thing,
of the worst of labor troubles? Labor organ-
isers of the Red variety talk most about it;
but, honestly, who practise it more—they or
the people who like to let the world know
that they are bosom friends of Sir James
and Lady Smith-Jones and are quite in the
habit of dropping in at Government House?
A FACER FOR LLOYD GEOROE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Thomas Henley has written to the Lord Mayor of
Sydney requesting to be dissociated from the move-
ment for getting Lloyd George to visit Australia,
on the ground that the ex-Prime Minister has been
recreant to the best interests of the British Empire
by helping the Labor Party into office.”
Wizard of Wales, no end of us were yearning
To see those kindly eyes, that massive brow,
To hear that voice upraised in accents burning.
Ah me, how slender are our chances now!
The enmity of Communists and such you
Might face unmoved. But won’t it sear your soul
To learn that Thomas Henley wouldn’t touch you—
Not with a ten-foot pole?
Time was when mobs of Jingoes flocked to groan you
With animosity that knew no bounds ;
Time was when titled landlords would have thrown
you,
Had they their will, like horsemeat to their hounds.
Serene you kept your way, through many a bliz/.anl
Of odium, to see a nation dote
Upon your name. Why did you spoil it, Wizard,
By getting Henley’s goat?
In Britain's hour of trial, from the beginning
When did your spirit flag, your zeal decrease?
Who else was half as prominent in winning
The war —although you couldn’t win the peace?
But, Wizard, though you’ve been (and evidently
Aspire to be again) your country’s pet,
Ere booking for Australia think intently
On this (God send the cables break it gently!):
Tom Henley has you set.

In only one other year—and that was at the
peak of the war-boom —were profits larger.
Too much importance should not be given that
happening, though, because 1923 profits may
have been assisted by the writing-down of
book values of stocks at the previous balance,
when the softgoods importers were “windy’
regarding the prospective volume of trade and
the prices they could get for their goods in an
unusually competitive market. After the
1920-21 slump P., L. and B. reserves slipped
back £62,500 so that values might be re-
duced to a sound basis, and in order to pay
usual divs. on prefs. and 7■> p.c. on ordinaries.
The next year showed a margin of only
£3211 over and above the same div. rates.
The worst fears of the bigger importers, how-
ever, were dispelled when prices hardened
slightly and the Commonwealth recovered
sufficiently from its mild depression and a
bad drought to continue as an active buyer.
Indeed, the softgoods houses experienced re-
markable luck when they were heavily loaded
with dear stocks during the period of
slump, because, thanks to the scattering of
loans, raised by State and _ Common-
wealth Governments for public works
and for war gratuities, etc., the spend-
ing capacity of the big cities was not
seriously impaired. Since the big houses un-
loaded most of their heavy and costly stocks,
their greatest difficulty lias been to adjust
selling to erratic prices caused by variations
in values at buying centres and by the com-
petition of middlemen forced to cut _ prices at
the dictation of the banks. Casualties among
the smaller fry in York-street and Flinders-
lane have been numerous: but even some of
the bigger houses, which hesitated to reduce
prices and clear stocks, have had a gruelling,
and some have lost trade which they may
never fully recover. Possibly the concerns
which did cut losses at the beginning and re-
stored their trading to a sound basis bene-
fited to some extent by others’ misfortunes.
Not all losses in the softgoods trade were
made on stocks, though; there were fail-
ures among retailers who were more or less
financed by the warehousemen. Only a couple
of: weeks ago one big suburban Sydney store
was forced into liquidation. P., L. and 8., at
its latest balance, showed £352,917 in sundry
debtors and bills receivable.
The regular run of 6 p.c. divs. down to
1917 suggested that there was not much in
this co. for its shareholders. However, the
actual return was better, because £161,192
of the £250,000 of ordinary capital was issued
for goodwill at the beginning. When the
business was turned over to the present co.
it was stipulated that ordinaries were not
to receive more than 6 p.c. until reserves of
£lOO,OOO had been accumulated and were re-
presented by investments wholly outside the
business. The latest accounts were the 22nd
lot since the co. was established on its pre-
sent basis, and besides having £lOO,OOO in
an external reserve —Government securities,
railway stocks and debentures, etc.—£l2s,ooo
had piled up in a general reserve fund, all
of which was employed in the business.
Taking into account the £10,568 balance at
P. and L. after payment of divs., there were
visible reserves of £74.376 over and above
the amount which would be required to write
off goodwill. Compared with only 10 years ago
the £250.000 of ordinaries have £76,000-odd
more funds helping to produce divs. Ordinaries
also have the use of a lot of money which is
very cheap nowadays : £350,000 of “A” prefs.
and £150,000 of “B” prefs., both taking only
6 p.c. p.a., and £230,000 of first-mortgage
debenture stock, which is not redeemable
until 1950 and carries only 4| p.c. The co.
thus lias the use of £730,000 for which it
must earn £40.925 p.a., an average rate of
less than 5J p.c. p.a.
The next table shows the movements of
balance-sheet figures since 1914 and during
the past three years:—
Liabilities.

Investments and
cash . . 114,242 125,542 133,109 108,362
The feature of the comparisons is that,
though £150,000 of new capital (preference)
has been raised since just prior to the war,
and £75,000 of reserves have accumulated,
the co. is depending on outsiders for £412,603
more. The accounts do not disclose how the
total of £677,946 is made up, but no doubt
the bank figures for a large amount. No
matter how “tight” money may be, York-
street and Flinders-lane importers seem
always to get a good hearing from the banks.
Last year the directors had an independent
investigation made of premises in the four
capitals ; they were valued at £200,000 more
than the book figures.

Reserves are treated as nominal partly
because in the table the amounts set aside
for depreciation (total now £5000) and for
contingencies (£1000) are included, but
chiefly because the extent of true reserves
depends on the actual worth of quarries and
plant. On these values also depends the
backing for much of the paid capital. The
co. is in much the same class as a mining
concern ; values of properties and equipment
depend largely on the demand for the pro-
duct, and it is on the outlook for profits
rather than on security for capital that, the
enterprise must be nteasured as an invest-
ment. For its first two years, with the
blue-metal business booming, the co. has
made £9OOO-odd over and above the amounts
required for 10 p.c. divs. on both prefs. and
ordinaries, and after providing for taxes.
This has permitted the writing-off of £2575
of flotation exes, (leaving a balance of
£1287), given the reserves already detailed,
and left a balance of £427 for the current
year’s P. and L. account. The present co.
was established to take over three quarries,
the Minnamurra and Bombo, both on the
N. S. Wales South Coast, near Kiama; and
the Prospect, near Toongabbie, not far from
Parramatta, which was originally owned by
the Emu and Prospect Gravel and Road
Metal Co. The public was offered £50,000
of 10 p.c. prefs.; these funds were wanted to
help finance the purchase of the Minnamurra
property and to equip the Bombo. Evi-
dently 42,095 shares were taken up; but
holders were given the option to convert into
ordinaries within two years of the date of
issue, and at the latest balance pref. holdings
had been reduced to 38.195, with an increase
from 70,616 to 85,593 in ordinary shares on
the year.
Though the co. has done very well, results
have not come up to the anticipations of
the prospectus. According to that docu-
ment £16,000 net profit was being earned
while the Bombo quarry was only partially
equipped, and the promoters expected an ex-
pansion to “well over £25,000” when that
proposition got into full swing. However,
shareholders cannot complain at the present
profit earning, which shows a big margin
over and above 10 p.c., and as additional
plant is being installed at Minnamurra to
produce all gauges of metal in demand, and
as the new machinery is designed to cut
labor costs, perhaps the co. will do better if
the current good market is maintained—it
seems likely to be for some years. Inci-
dentally. Minnamurra is declared to be the
best-equipped blue-metal quarry in the Com-
monwealth. There is still £16,275 of the
nurchase price of that property outstanding.
Balance-sheet figures for the two years have
been as follows :
1922. 1923.
Minnamurra purchase .. £20,925 £16,275
Overdraft . . .. 5,996 1,614
Other creditors . . ... 5,052 6,518

Stocks 3,325 3,651
Book debts 23,845 25,735
Cash and sundries.. .. 1,055 909
Liabilities were down £7566 on the year, but
£11,077 of new capital was required to effect
that improvement and to put in addi-
tional plant. The deposits worked by the
co. are so large as to be practically inex-
haustible. so there is no immediate necessity
for creating a sinking-fund to provide for a
return of capital when metal supplies give
out, unless, of course, the properties are held
under leases which may not be renewed. On
that point no. information is available.

Last year was easily the Lamson-Paragon
co.’s best: before taking £lOOO for a stall
fund, but after making provision for depreci-
ation, etc., profits gave almost 25 p.c. on the
£75,000 of paid capital. "All factories,” the
directors say, "contributed to the most satis-
factory result.” Additions to the Sydney
factory are nearing completion, and business
in Melbourne has so expanded that factory
extensions are contemplated there, too. The
Westralian branch in the previous financial
year was amalgamated with a stationery
business and converted into a separate co.:
the parent holds £13,334 of shares in it, and
they returned 7 p.c. for the past 12 months.
The latest accounts are the 14th lot since
the present co. was formed to take over a
proprietary which had run the business for
nearly 30 years. The expansion in 10 years
is shown in these comparisons : —-

At October 31 there were £31,000 or so of
reserves to assist £75,000 of capital, and
most of the profits accumulated had been
sunk in the business. The co. was very
snug: all outside debts amounted to £8339,
and they were easily covered by cash assets.
Here are balance-sheet comparisons going
back 10 years :

Ten years ago goodwill stood in the books at
£7OOO, but the whole of that intangible asset
has been written off out of profits. Perhaps
there was some goodwill consideration in the
Westralian float, but it is too small to be
of any consequence. Since 1913 the book
value of fixed assets has advanced £43,976
and liquid assets (including shares in the
W.A. co.) £27,336. Meanwhile outside debt
has been reduced £4855- The total of net
tangible assets had, therefore, grown £76,167
by October 31 last: new capital contributed
£44,870, and the balance of £31,297 repre-
sented the strengthening from surplus pro-
fits. Put another way, in 10 years the co.
did so well that, after having paid good divs.,
surplus profits exceeding paid capital at the
beginning of the period were left in the busi-
ness.

This little Bendigo trustee co. is in its 14th
year, but so far shareholders have made
very little out of minding dead men’s shoes.
Paid capital is £11,780. The div. rate from
the beginning has averaged only 4 p.c., but
£3404 of surplus profit has been laid aside
after meeting preliminary costs and the ex-
pense of developing the business. The man-
agement does not disclose the book value of
the estates entrusted to it, but every annual
report announces an increase in the total.
The early years of a trustee co., however,
cannot be expected to produce much of a
harvest; generally it is a matter of looking
dignified and businesslike so that the man
with investments may be induced to “men-
tion” the office in his will. Then the manage-
ment must sit back and wait until he is
obliging enough to die. This little office has
received a bunch of notifications intimating
that its services will be employed later on, so
if it behaves itself as a trustee co. should its
business will develop steadily. Mean-
while. work has become so onerous on the
Board of six that a seventh director was re-
cently appointed, a merchant joining two
graziers, a gentleman, a lawyer, an investor
and an auctioneer to assist in attracting the
goose that will lay the golden divs. For the
past 12 months commission and interest earn-
ings contributed £3157; exes, took £2063.
The earnings of the co.’s own funds are
small, because practically the whole of the
capital paid in at the beginning went into
Yic. Inscribed Stock, that being the guaran-
tee demanded by the Act. In addition to the
£lO,OOO there, the only other revenue-
producing asset is £4600 in Commonwealth
loans. Altogether the eo. now has £15,000
of belongings to guarantee its good be-
havior, and there is £11,780 more callable
from shareholders.

Profits in the table are very different from
those presented by Profit and Loss accounts.
If figurings there be taken seriously, it would
seem a marvel how the office could have
regularly written cheques for the 10 p.c.
divs. Here are the profits as announced by
the accounts for five years: 1919, £20,963;
1920, £21,393; 1921, £23,642; 1922, £24,118;
1923, £25,000. In that period a couple of
pounds more than the total net profit dis-
closed has gone into shareholders’ pockets.
However, those were the balances left “after
making provision for depreciation* etc., etc.”
The extent of the depreciation allowances
has not been disclosed, and nobody except
those right inside can tell whether more than
sufficient has been laid aside to provide for
renewals and for wastage of assets. Move-
ments of liquid assets in a balance-sheet usu-
ally partially reveal the effect of the lay-by
for depreciation, etc., but in this instance so
much has been spent on the collieries in
recent years that comparisons are not help-
ful. The differences between the profits in
the table and those stated by the directors
are the additions to various reserves, which
the Board has not counted as profits. Here
are reserve movements since 1919:
1919. 1920. 1921. 1922. 1923.

In five years an average of more than £lO,OOO
p.a. has gone into these four accounts, and
that means the lay-by of a trifle more than
4 p.c. p.a. on present capital after giving
shareholders 10 p.c. regularly. It can be
taken for granted that the amounts dropped
into the insurance reserve and the contin-
gency account have been just as. much true
profits as the additions to the dividend and
general reserves.
For many years paid capital was £lOO,OOO,
but 10 years ago the flood of inner reserves
rose so high in the office, and div. prospects
looked so bright, that capital was doubled
by writing up assets. In 1920 £25,000 of
scrip was offered at par—it was promptly
snapped up by proprietors—to pay for new
equipment for the Wallsend and Pelton col-
lieries. In the past four years the book
value of mines and equipment has expanded
£71,926 after unspecified amounts have been
written off. They are on the . books at
£367,196, nearly half as much again as paid
capital. However, owing to the large re-
serves the co.’s position is very snug:—

Liquid assets . . 97,447 110,575 71,921 63,414
Investments, book debts and cash were
£28,374 larger than all outside liabilities
when the final div. had been extracted.

How Policy, the London insurance news-
paper, views our boom in life flotations: —
Australia is at present experiencing quite a glut
of new life offices. It would seem as though most
of these new cos. have been evolved by a process
similar to the formation of some of the heavenly
bodies. An internal eruption seems to take place in
small offices, and officials break away to form minor
concerns. Many of these concerns can only have
the experience of a comet —a flash, and then^gone.
N. S. Wales Mines Department is once
more passing on to the public the pick ot
the information gleaned by its officers. Some
excellent work was done in the “Mineral
Resources” series years ago, but probably
because Treasurers refused to make money
available for the one Department which pays
its way and performs good service in
opening up the “vast natural resources” the
politicians talk so much about, publications
have been severely restricted. Even the De-
partment’s annual report is only half the
bulk it used to be. Of course, a few other
things have been issued —E. C. Andrews s

Broken Hill is plugging along steadily with
lead at a high price, and big profits are
coming in. Mexico has again been enjoying
a famny scrap, and as production there repre-
sents a big portion of the world's output, the
disturbance must have a big influence on
the metal market. Matters at the Hill as
regards labor are quiet, excepting that the
union is worrying the cos. to remove some of
the 21 specified diseases from the examining
doctors list. The cos. had to adopt a policy
of strict medical examination of all new-
comers to prevent penalisation under the
various Compensation Acts. Unfortunately,
some genuine cases were overlooked in the
hurry to clean things up, and some deserving
old hands were denied compensation pay-
ments, while others with very short employ-
ment records made a good thing out of it.
Generally the whole business is irksome to
both parties, and there is room for a
commonsense compromise.

The North managed to boost its output
immediately after the British mine was pur-
chased, and is now hauling about 5000 tons
weekly. No sign is seen yet of any consoli-
dation of work and treatment which was
talked of as the immediate policy when the
British was taken over. That show is
Plugging along in the same old way with
Oyril Emery still at the helm, and is making
handsome contributions to North profits in
the present metal market. North shares
have been very much in favor lately in anti-
cipation of an increased div. There is no
doubt that present load prices would enable
George Weir's bonanza to make a liberal in-
crease on last year’s div. rate. The com-
bined output of ore from the North and
British mines is about 32,000 tons per month
at present.
James Hebbard is trying boring to get
down to the seat of the fire in the Central,
which is giving him as much trouble as ever.
It is quite evident that it will be a long
time before the Central can be re-opened.
Meanwhile, the newly-acquired Junction is
being worked for an increasing output, and
the ore is being milled at the Central, to-
gether with some old slime.
The Central fire is not likely to worry
the South much; the precautionary measures
adopted by Fairweather and his staff seem
to have been effective. However, the seep-
age of immense quantities of water from
the Central is both troublesome and costly
to the South. A large part of the under-
ground workings is submerged and inacces-
sible for the time being owing to this influx,
and the South is continually pumping and
bailing.
Good progress is being made with the new
plant at the Zinc Corp., and it should soon
be running. The Corp. has put up a very
good performance since resuming mining last
year, the grade of the ore liaving been very
/nuch better than usual. With a lead assay-
value of between 16 p.c. and 17 p.c., good
metallurgy and favorable costs, the co. is
making good profits.
Proprietary is treating its own and Block
14 ore with its new all-sliming process, but
it is rumored that gravity treatment will be
resumed to some extent.

Gretamain Collieries, Ltd., which was
floated in Sydney in 1922 to take over 800
acres of coal-lands six miles from Cessnock
(N.S.W.), has issued its first accounts. The
purchase price payable to the vendors was
£33,000, in 25,000 fully-paid £1 ordinaries
and £BOOO cash, the latter being a refund of
expenditure on development by the vendors.
In addition, £21,500 cash was to go to the
owner of 683 acres of freehold, £10,750 of
it to be paid in instalments spread over two
years. The public was offered 80,000 con-
tribs.. but it subscribed only 30,355. Con-
sequently, to open up and equip the colliery
the directors had to go outside for funds.
Against £54,917 of paid capital as at Novem-
ber 30 last —all except £438 of the contrib.
issue had been got in—£lB,9l2 had been
raised by debentures, £11.500 was the balance
owing on the purchase of freeholds, and £938
was due to sundry creditors. Debentures
for £38,275 were issued, and £19,363 was
callable at the balancing-date. Develop-
ment in the main tunnels has shown “coal
of first-class quality of an average thickness
of about lift, free from bands.” The I|-
mile branch railway connecting with the
East Greta Co.’s line has been completed;
sidings, a gantry and screening platform
have been constructed; a large dam has been
completed, and trucks have been purchased.
Boilers and hauling machinery are now in
course of erection, so at an early date pro-
duction will commence.
Following the find of favorable formations
in the South Lucknow (N.S.W.), Lucknow
Pups now flatters itself that it has some-
thing which may lead to better things. In
the 114 ft. level a winze has got on
to a oft. body of stone in which are two
veins of calcite, each a foot wide, and a lot
of mineral showing. The next move is to
trace the formation to the contact of diorite
and serpentine, if it lives there, because only
in that position in past Lucknow experience
were the bonanza values found in the spurs.
A. P. Penman has given a favorable opinion
of a low-grade gold proposition near Tum-
blong (N.S.W.), on the Cootamundra-Tumut
railway. ' A 15-acre lease held by E. C.
Neave lias been optioned, and further areas
secured. Penman states that the tormation
is massive quartz and ironstone, with small
bands of slate. It forms the crown of a
hill rising 100 ft. “Sufficient evidence is
available to state definitely that the deposit
is at least two chains wide and several
chains in length. The general average as
disclosed would approximate 8 or 10 dwt. per
ton.” The show can be worked by open-cut.
Recently C. Lonsdale Smith took charge
of Dumbrell’s Bygoo, near Ardlethan
(N.S.W.), and soon afterwards he informed
the directors that every available ounce of
tin-bearing material had been gouged out,
and that the finding of other pay-shoots de-
pended on development. The directors are
out to raise the required £2OOO by offering
200 £lO debentures carrying 124 p.c. interest.

No. 2 float on the Mount Isa field is
Mount Isa Prop. Silver-lead, Ltd., which is
being formed to take over half a dozen pro-
mising leases, including the Out-on-Her-Own,
Even Break, Ibus and Argyle blocks. The
co. is in 400,000 shares of ss. each, of which
280,000 are reserved. H. B. Jamieson, of
Sydney, is the secretary, and V. J. Saddler
and J. Milliean are first directors.
A pretty squabble has developed in Queens-
land over the large territory (3600 sq. miles)
reserved by the Government as a “State area”
for oil-prospecting. The 60 miles square
lies immediately north of Roma, and is
generally conceded by geologists to offer the
best prospects for commercial pools in
Queensland. The Government has done
nothing during the past two years, and at
least four applications have been refused
recently by the Mines Department fnr
blocks within the reserve wanted by
cos. or groups ready to put plant
on the ground and start work imme-
diately. It seems a dog-in-tne-mangcr
policy, particularly in view of the Lander
Co. having been permitted to enter the
charmed area. Possibly the Minister is now
waiting to see how the Lander gets on with
its Orallo bore, but even an optimist would
not dare to gamble on a strike of payable oil
in a first bore in what, after all, is not
yet a proved oil region. No one could com-
plain if the State was putting down test
bores, but the Government refuses to under-
take that work, and will not allow anyone
else to do it, with the exception of the Lander
Co. Among the applicants for ground are
the Australian Oil Corporation, for whom
Dr. Jensen, as consulting geologist, has
selected an area, and a wealthy group for
whom ex-State driller Arthur Moore has
picked a site. Moore went to California at
his own expense last year to gain the experi-
ence for this venture.

Rumors of good gold started a rush to
Batavia, an inaccessible field on the Cape
York Peninsula (N.Q.), where some of the
diehards still hang out and occasionally strike
good patches of the yellow metal in leaders
in rotten granite. An official disclaimer
settled the matter, and the 37 miners on
the old field will miss the excitement of a
pack of greenhorns bursting in on their
solitude.
Derek's tin, Stannary Hills (N.Q.), will
shortly be getting busy on its large low-
grade reserves, the installation of a further
10 head of stamps, winding plant and com-
pressor having been completed. A good
water supply is assured, and the co., after
a bad spin, should make up some of the
leeway while tin is at a handsome figure.
The You and Me lode will give large quanti-
ties of 2 p.c. ore.
Tyrconnell (N.Q.) rather disappointed its
supporters at the intersection of the main-
and cross-reefs at No. 6 level. At No. 5
values were well over the ounce where the
reefs met, but in No. 6 they had declined to
12dwt., and the gold was of poorer quality.
Values 40ft. from the rise improved to
lodwt.

The arsenic treatment works at the Sun-
down mine, West Ballandean, near Wallan-
garra, on the N. S. Wales-Queensland border,
are being taken over by O. C. Roberts, and
will be operated in conjunction with the
arsenic works at Wallangarra. The Sun-
down mine prior to 1918 was worked for tin
and copper only, and the arsenic w’ent to
waste. Later the arsenic beeame a by-pro-
duct. Now it is the other things that will
be the by-products.

G. P. Doolette’s death recalls some West-
ralian mining memories. “G.P.” was one of
the little band of Adelaide speculators who in
1893 backed W. G. Brookman and S. W.
Pearce in their prospecting trip to Westralia.
When capital was needed to develop the
Great Boulder and prove Brookman’s asser-
tion that it was worth millions, Doolette was
sent to London, and after a hard battle got
the necessary cash. The flotation was an
epoch in the history of the State’s gold-mining.
The original syndicate formed in 1893 con-
sisted of 15 shares of £lO each, of which five
went to the prospectors. Five years later
the market value of the syndicate’s holding
was set down at about 9} millions sterling,
which, with the amount already returned to
shareholders, made a total of £13,646,750.
Doolette's perseverance and powers of per-
suasion were the means of bringing hundreds
of thousands of English capital to the West-
ralian goldfields, and his success caused
many other alleged “Boulders” to be placed
on the London market. In the case of one,
which was floated on three boxes of speci-
mens, the London directors at their first
meeting cabled to the manager to instal a
battery and commence crushing without de-
lay. Back came the laconic reply: “Return
the reef.”

London having found a few thousands to
diamond-drill at Wiluna (W.A.), Adelaide
is marshalling its brigade of call-paying cos.
for an invasion of the field should results
prove satisfactory. Some months ago Jack
McDermott offered, on behalf of Collier and
others of London, to raise and expend
£300,000 to work the Gwalia Consolidated
and other shows, provided the drill struck
the values he anticipated it would and the
State Government built a railway to the field.
The Government finally agreed that, if bore-
hole results were all right and McDermott
found the working capital, it would build the
line. The bores now about to be put down
will be under Government supervision, and
a few months’ drilling should determine
whether Wiluna will be resurrected.

Loch Fyne, Matlock (Vic.), spent nearly
£5OOO at the mine, and a couple of hundreds
otherwise, in the half-year to November 30,
but it won only £l6 of gold. Some backers
became wearied of paying the calls required
to persevere with the search for stone for
the battery, but others were found to lift
the forfeited scrip and give the co. a few
pounds again. They are being encouraged
by mine-manager J. V. Lake, who declares
that “the outlook is more promising than at
any other time” since he took over from
John Friel. Work during the six months
was concentrated on a " formation sighted
near the shaft in the previous term. In
driving 36ft. Lake went into 2ft. of stone,
and gold showed in rising 89ft. He then
decided to go back to the crosscut from No.
1 level, which was already in 200 ft. Within
Bft, the formation came in, and for 75ft. a
promising body 3ft. to 4ft. wide has been
exposed. Pay-shoots are still absent, but a
big prospecting field has come within range,
and. should several “ifs” of Vic. mountain-
mining develop favorably all the recent call-
paying won’t have gone for nothing.

Since the 1906 boom, interest in gold-
dredging in Maoriland lias gradually faded
out. Many of the propositions drifted with
more or less success until the drhdges became
too old or proved inefficient to handle deeper
ground. One of the last attempts with Aus-
tralian capital was at Rimu, in the South
Island, but the ground proved too severe for
the plant. This area has since been success-
fully handled by an American co. with a
powerful Californian dredge: for 1922
1.147,790 yd. worth 9d. per yd., were handled
for a recovery of 10,1630 z., worth £44,802.
The dredge is now treating 200,000 yd. of
sixpenny ground per month at a working
cost of 3d. A Sydney crowd led by W. A. Free-
man is impressed with the possibilities of a
large modern dredge in a portion of the
Clutha Valley, one of the few dredging areas
still available in M.L. Other enterprises have
done well in the narrow gorges below the
area under consideration: the Hartley and
Riley paid £79,625 of divs. on a capital of
£6300, and the Electric £116,350 of divs. on
£26,000 paid capital. Attempts were made
in deeper ground, but the wrong dredges were
put to work. Rights were recently acquired
over a likely area by the Clutha Syndicate:
W. Leitch and party and C. N. Taylor
(M.L.) ; W. A. Freeman, L. V. Waterhouse,
Frank Hambridge and F. Leverrier (Syd-
ney) ; and F. V. Stanley (Taiping). The
syndicate is promoting a development co. of
£lO,OOO in £1 shares, in which it takes 5000
fully-paids and £440. The area is definitely
known to carry values, but the question is
whether the average is payable. The co.
proposes to scout-bore 250 acres, and, if re-
sults are satisfactory, to close-bore 1500
acres.. That work will establish whether
the installation of a powerful dredge
capable of handling 200,000 yd. per month
would be warranted. It is a good gamble
for a big prize; the average depth of the
ground is 60ft., and 1000 acres averaging
only a penny per yd. more than working costs
would turn in half a million or so of profit.

Ronpibon (Siam) has had the general experi-
ence of dredge construction costing more than
the estimates. Instead of the £68,200 anti-
cipated, £115,000 Avas required by the time
the plant was assembled and erected at Ron-
pibon. The whistles will blow on February
11, and Siamese territory to the extent of
125.000 yards per month should be turned
over. Borings have given from lib. to 31b.
per yard, and at three-quarter capacity, in
the pound ground, a monthly profit of £3OOO
is expected in the present tin market.

VISITOR (to sweet mother): “And how does your

MOTHER ( wearily ): “Sound asleep.”
An echo from Mt. Rennie:—
The death of the Presbyterian Rev. T. J. Curtis
recalls an incident in connection with the Mount
Rennie affair about which The Bulletin was so
concerned in its early days. Nine young men were
found guilty of the crime and sentenced to death,
that being the penalty imposed by the Act. Of the
nine, three were reprieved by the Executive, the
fate of the remainder being left in the hands of the
Governor, Lord Carrington, but recently arrived.
Public opinion was divided strongly on the question
whether, in view of the youth and ignorance of the
condemned, the extreme penalty ought to be exacted.
Deputation after deputation waited on his Ex., among
them many public men, including Henry Parkas.
But a fear that clemency would tend to encourage
that class of crime set another section against any
mitigation. The day before the date fixed was one
of great excitement in the city, with throngs of
people going to and from Government House. Late
in the day his Ex. announced that he had reprieved
two of the six. This left two lads of 19 and two
of 17 to die. The night before the executions 1
was at Darlinghurst Gaol, and, passing through the
open space in front of the governor’s residence, saw
Nosey Bob, the hangman, sitting on the bank of a
grass lawn, smoking his pipe. I spoke to him about
the arrangements for the morning and referred to
the two reprieves. One might have expected some
expression of relief that thus much of such a task
had been spared him. Instead, he complained of
the trouble he had been put to in making accommo-
dation for six; and now it all went for nothing.
Then, with an uncanny pride in his office, he com
plained that these reprieves would rob him of a
record—only four in a row instead of six!
The following morning the executions took place.
A special scaffold had been erected in a wing of
the gaol, where a number of corridors leading from
iron galleries came to a sort of focal point. Outside
the gaol some two thousand persons had congregated.
Inside, crowding the iron galleries, and w T ith the buzz
of anticipation that precedes the opening of a play,
were gathered the “ticket-holders” to a number
well over a hundred. It might have been a public
instead of a so-called private execution. But as the
procession from the cells came up the corridor
leading to the scaffold, the buzz of voices ceased,
and the silence of approaching death rested on the
place. By the side of each of the condemned walked
his spiritual comforter. With the prisoner Read
a slight, boyish figure—was Mr. Curtis, which of the
two the more blanched of face it was hard to say.
Each lad was taken to his appointed place. Read
stood motionless, his eyes closed, his face turned
upward. Then the minister spoke. The boy about
to die had given him a written statement to be
held sacred until after his execution. In this he
declared his innocence and said: “I will enter into
the presence of God with a clear conscience, know-
ing that I am innocent.” Then came a touch of
inspiration, it seemed to me: Mr. Curtis turned to the
white upraised face of the boy and kissed it. Then he
drew aside and covered his own face with his hands.
What followed will probably never be blotted from
the memories of those present. The hangman and
his assistant adjusted the ropes and the bolt was
drawn. The weights of the prisoners and the
proportionate distances of the drops had been mis-
calculated. The neck of one only was broken; the
remaining three were slowly strangled.
The same day I saw Mr. Curtis to obtain from
him the declaration. The interview was in the manse
at Redfern, and I shall never forget the breakdown
of this earnest, nerve-strained man. He had been
with the boy almost continuously and had no doubt
of his innocence, yet could not save his life. I read
the declaration, and it, with the minister’s deep
conviction, has ever since left in my mind a doubt,
never to be solved, whether that morning I had not
seen an innocent lad done to death.

“Howitzer”: I know a returned soldier
who cured himself of what looked like an
incurable injury by trying to blow out his
brains. Wounded badly in the head during
the war, he returned a shattered wreck, and
after four years of ineffectual treatment,
despairing of a recovery he decided to take
the shortest way out of his troubles. The
bullet entered above the right ear
arid came out on the top of the
head, leaving him alive but uncon-
scious. A doctor operated and re-
moved some bone which was press-
ing on the brain. The ex-Digger
recovered—-and now enjoys excel-
lent health. The surgeon’s explana-
tion is that the operation eliminated
a splinter of bone left in the old
wound, which had caused all his
previous trouble.
♦ * *
“Anaf”: At one time synovitis
was the ambition of every A.I.F.
malingerer, and many were the
methods employed to produce the
real thing or something that would
pass for it. A hospital orderly,
who thought he knew’ something,
offered to set up a genuine case for
£5. A couple of Diggers paid over
the money, and he injected into
the. knee of each a hypodermic
syringeful of soft paraffin, with
the ghastly results that might be
looked for when neither syringe nor
needle had been sterilised before-
hand. One of the men lost his leg;
the other became a permanent
cripple. Before this they disclosed
what bad happened and a court-martial gave
the orderly three years. In the hands of a
skilled operator the method might have re-
sulted in the simulation of synovitis, since
the paraffin would not have been absorbed,
but would have remained in the tissues.

“Macquarie Street” attends Lenin :
No definite information ever leaked out concerning
the mysterious illness of Vladimir Ulianoff, better
known as Nikolai Lenin, though a little over 12
months ago we were deluged with cables of dubious
veracity that he was dead, that he wasn’t dead, that
lots of people wished to Heaven he was dead, that he
hadn’t the slightest intention of dying, etc. From
his sudden extinguishment in the Moscow hills,
whither he had dragged his weary body in search
of health, it can be deduced that the doctrinaire
tyrant suffered from arterio-sclerosis. The disease, I
take it, which put him hors de combat with regard
to administrative business a year ago was cerebral
haemorrhage, and I have arrived at this diagnosis by
sifting the misleading cables. And he was put out
of administrative business because he could no longer
make his commands understood owing to the nature
and position of the lesion. The haemorrhage hap-
pened to take place in the region of the speech
centre, so that, in addition to right-sided paralysis,
he suffered from aphasia as well. That illness effec-
tually put a stop to the workings of Lenin’s extra-
ordinary brain; and as loss of speech accompanied
by hemiplegia is regarded as the most lamentably
miserable physical condition to which humankind can
be reduced, worse even than the last stages of
CHOOK, CHOOK!
“And I asked for a Spring chicken, darling!”
“Yes, dammit, hut they needn’t have sent it all spring!”
phthisis or cancer, his most implacable enemies,
could not have wished him a more horrible or
deplorable affliction. The cerebral haemorrhage
theory is borne out by Lenin’s sudden decease.
That he was able to travel recently proves that the
paralysis of his leg had improved somewhat; this
is often seen in chronic hemiplegia, the arm move-
ments and the aphasia remaining unaffected. The
lengthy period of illness, accompanied by motor
inactivity, rigidity and wasting, would inevitably
lead to an increased friability of Lenin’s cerebral
arteries, so that the fresh attack of bleeding which
ended his career at 54 would excite no surprise in
medical circles. Sudden death is the rule in cases
of haemorrhage into the Pons varolii, a part of the
brain adjacent to the centre for respiration. Presi-
dent Harding, it will be remembered, died from the
same cause.

“10-2-4” : One of the most invidious jobs
in Sydney, from the standpoint of self-
respecting Government servants, is surely
that of the policemen who are detailed to
catch restaurants suspected of breaking the
liquor laws. These officials do not go as
detectives, but as provocative agents. They
are required to be liars before they can
prove a case. Often the waiter is reluctant
to serve them, and then it is their anti-
social business to break down his scruples;
to remind Mm of the agonies suffered by
thirsty diners; to hint at great rewards if
he complies; to point out that rival estab-
lishments are not so pernicketty. If the
business were dignified by a spice of danger
it would be less ignoble. A policeman, for
example, who made up as an affluent drunk,
and risked a crack on the head with a bottle
by taking a walk by night through Surry
Hills might both win commendation for his
courage and rid the community of the worst
sort of pests. But the veriest rabbit can
disguise himself in his notion of faultless
evening attire, and posture for an hour or
so’ at a hotel as a dissipated man of wealth.
If this unsavory work has to be done by
somebody, it should be handed over to females
with no particular reputation to sustain,
and to men of the same character who are
outside the Force and have no hope in life
of ever being admitted to it.
* * * *
“Dr. Nil” clears up a mystery:—
I think it is fair to the memory of the late
Judge Gordon (S.A.) to mention the following facts.
About a year ago a man was convicted, in Adelaide,
of his second serious offence against girl-children.
He was brought before the acting gaol surgeon for
the latter to decide whether he was fit to undergo
a flogging to which he had been sentenced, in addi-
tion to a term of hard labor, by Judge Gordon.
The surgeon certified that the man was “fit,” so
far as he could tell. Later on, but before the date
fixed for the flogging, the surgeon was asked to see
the Judge, who explained that the law left him no
option as to the, sentence in second offences of this
nature. He questioned the surgeon as to his
reasons for certifying the prisoner as “fit,” and
stated that he had been much concerned as to the
man’s capability of standing a flogging. After
careful reconsideration by the surgeon and the Judge
they agreed that there was a doubt as to tile man’s
“physical fitness,” and a medical certificate was
made out accordingly. As a result, the flogging
part of the sentence was remitted; but it
was agreed that it would be unwise to
make this known just then. My reason for
writing this now is that a Bulletin paragraph
mentioning the case remarked upon the “savage
sentence.” But because the Judge was an exceedingly
humane man, and because The Bulletin was such
an old friend of his, he was, 1 know, much distressed,
and yet felt that he must put up with the impli-
cation of having become “savage” in his old age
rather than make it known that he had done any-
thing to keep the sentence from being carried into
effect.

“Roundsman”: A minor bigamy case in
Melbourne has raised again the question
whether woman is an accountable animal.
The second wife, who was a clerk and of some
education, signed a document, apparently for
her “husband’s” protection, setting forth that
she knew he had a previous wife living—at
least, the document was produced and she
acknowledged the writing. agreement the
pair never lived together. He didn’t supply
her with money and a palatial home; he
didn’t even buy her a motor-car on terms.
He rented a room in a cheap street, and in
the cheap street trouble soon arose about
the alleged vanishment of jewellery. She
may have married for the sake of intellectual
conversation, but there is no evidence that
he had any. If she took her rather uncertain
bargain for the sake of his name, there is

the difficulty that she didn’t legally acquire
the name, and if she had it wasn’t Mont-

ously accused of owning the fatal beauty of
a young Greek god. Even the Court, which

happen) to inquire about the jewellery which
had vanished from the mean street, was a
trifle dazed over the matrimonial side-issue.

I saw her in a tram the other day,
A tabby that I told you of before—
The one wot threw the glad on Anzac Day,
And warmed me frozen spirit to the core;
A-’angin’ to a strap, ’er white arm bare,
And gleamin’ like a tombstone wet with dew,
And ’neath a bonzer ’at ’er dazzlin’ ’air.
A bloke was siftin’ down. I takes me cue.
“Escuse me, Dig.,” I ses, “this crowded car
Was never meant for man to take ’is ease.
Fair woman is the weakest sect by far.”
“All right,” ’e ses; “there’s room on both me
knees.”
'Er beauteous cheek was quickly flushed with red,
’Er bonzer eyes was flamin’ up a treat,
And all me hot blood rushes to me ’ead.
I grabs ’is ear and jerks him to ’is feet.
“ ’Ere, what the ’ell” ’e starts, “lmshi, yer
rat,”
1 ses, “toot sweet! This ain’t no movie play.”
’ls ’arf-cooked eyes was ’id by blobs of fat.
“All right, yer swine,” ’e ses, and slinks away.
Me tabby settled in the vacant chair,
And ’angin’ to the strap I takes me fill
Of starry eyes and ’eaps of golden ’air,
And bonzer clothes with many a nartless frill.
“I’m sorry ’e annoyed you, miss.” She spoke—
’Er voice like silver music seemed to me.
“Hoh, not at all,” she ses; “’twas quite a joke,”
And then I asked ’er if ’er nights was free,
she smiled a bit at this and screwed ’er glove,
And then, ’er eyes was filled with mystic light.
“I ’aven’t seen,” she ses, ‘Why Women Love.’ ”
And so we fixed a meet for Thursday night.

“2nd Divvy’s” disclosure :
Lord Cassillis, who is visiting Australia and M.I-.
on Masonic business, is the only earl who ever kicked
me out of a town. It was just before the last
bombardment of Bailleul, and our visitor was Town
Major. The battery was behind Messines ; the O.C.
decided to celebrate the arrival of his D.S.O. by an
outing, and I was one of two officers detailed to
participate in the revels. A Digger, in charge of
a cook’s cart and a pair of mules, accompanied us
to pick up and convoy back various provisions and
drinks —especially drinks. After dinner at the Bail-
leul Club, and further refreshment at the bar, the
Major was ready to call on a couple of \ .M.C.A.
youths whom he knew slightly and disliked. The
Y.M.C.A. officials returned no answer to our leader's
peremptory knockings, and only upon a shouted
threat from him to burst in by violence and place
all present under arrest did they at last admit us.
A lamentable scene ensued, the holy lads being
alternately cursed for not providing drinks and for
omitting to stand smartly to attention. In the midst
of the uproar, one of them must have telephoned to
the Town Major, for suddenly, out of the darkness
of the unlighted street, we became aware of the
presence of a small but sinister figure in kilts and
a tiny Glengarry cap. His words are burnt upon
my brain. “You will leave my town, Major Blank,
which you have disgraced.” He strode to the front
doorstep and pointed with his stick. “Your motor-
car, I see, is here. You and your officers will enter
your car, and you will drive whence you have come.
At once!” We peered past him and saw the cook’s
cart. “At once !” The situation admitted of no
argument. With a shifty salute the Major stumbled
down the steps and was half lifted, half pushed into
the enlarged box on wheels which was already over-
stocked with brussels sprouts and bottles. We
followed, the mules started in response to a roar
from the driver, and as we banged away over the
cobblestones the minatory figure of the Earl was to
be seen in the doorway like an avenging angel at
the gates of Paradise. He believed to the last, I
fancy, that we executed our hegira in a Rolls-Royce.

was simply sent there to acquire that polish
expected of one who was to hold the King’s
commission; in fact, the training was gener-
ally referred to as a “knife and fork course.”
There certainly was a wide gulf between my
customary dixie-laden scramble for stew at
the cookhouse call and my first dinner as a
cadet at Oxford. Through the venerable
cloisters we marched in file, and took up our
positions outside a studded oaken door; then,
preceded by the college president—who stayed
in residence throughout the war —we entered
a huge dining-hall, with mullioned windows
and lofty walls adorned with oil portraits of

bygone dignitaries. Dazzling was the orderly
array of cutlery on the spotless table linen
before us, imperturbable the faces of the old
college retainers standing stiffly to atten-
tion. A premonitory knock from the presi-
dent’s table on the dais; a stream of Latin
beginning with “Benedictus benedicot”
we bowed our heads at what we took to be
some form of grace—and presently we col-
lapsed into our seats positively sweating from
the strain. Our meal over, we were obliged
to remain seated till a further grace was
offered. But we soon began to grudge the
holes those dinners made in our limited even-
ing leave, and after the first few nights it
was not uncommon to see, long before
the concluding grace, three or four cadets
crawling out on all fours through the door-
way, while their seated table-mates would
assume grotesque attitudes in their efforts
to screen the clandestine exits.
“Riverina”: The Egyptian
climate has remarkable preserv-
ing properties. Rambling over
the old battlefield of Tel-el-
Kebir, on which the British
fought the Arabs in ’B2, we in-
spected the breastworks erected
by the former. Although com-
posed of nothing more substan-
tial than alternate layers of
rushes and sandy earth, they
were still quite sound. W e
pulled out handfuls of the
rushes —intact after more than
30 years. Incidentally, in the
litter of human bones, sun-
baked equipment and broken
water-bottles we found scores
of bandages, apparently smeared
with oil or ointment; and it
brought home vividly the hard-
ships endured on those old cam-
paigns to find that most of these
bandages were patched. Re-
membering those unsheltered relics I am not
surprised at Tnt.’s furniture being still
pretty serviceable.

“Topee”: Sgt. Dan Mulligan used to con-
duct the R.C. party from our detachment to
Bishop Couppee’s church at Vunapope (late
German New Guinea). One Sunday a Bel-
gian priest was officiating, and there being no
acolyte present, Dan volunteered his services.
All went smoothly till the time came for
pouring the consecrated wine into the chalice.
It was at this point that habit became too
strong for Dan. His whispered “Father, say
whin,” was audible all over the sacred
building.

were some shudder-

hand Jack Ketches

raw hands nowa-

“Saaedi”: Squatter Soakitup, though a
convivial character, is yet very much of a hard
head. When McSapling, the stock-agent at
Woolbale, had a mob of 3000 wethers for sale
he unfortunately forgot this latter fact while
remembering the former. Soakitup was
accordingly well oiled in Woolbale at the
agent’s expense before the pair started out
on the 20-mile trip to inspect the wethers.
Arrived at the yards Soakitup climbed the
fence with difficulty, and, getting in amongst
the jumbucks, eyed them with enthusiasm.
“Enormous sheep,” he exulted; “beautiful
—hie—sheep.” The agent smiled smugly.
“Yes, they’re a slashing good line, Mr. Soak-
itup,” he agreed. But now a change came
over Soakitup’s countenance. He stared
suspiciously at the animals. “There aren’t
any wethers like those I can see in the whole
world!” he wailed. “You’ve overdone it,
McSapling. You made me too drunk.” And
he wouldn’t buy ’em either.

“Sammas” : Litchfield’s sketch, “The Color
Scheme” (B. 10/l/’24), depicts a Hebrew
clothier wearing an embroidered cap (offi-
cially known as a “yamalke”) over a face
almost bare of hirsute adornment. This is
irreconcilable with Hebrew usage. The
really orthodox Jew never doffs his head-
gear even at the table or during ablutions,
but he would regard it as an infinitely greater
crime to shave his beard. Should he desire
to doll himself up he is permitted the use
of scissors, the facial effect generally resem-
bling a discarded hairbrush left out in the
rain. Tradition also affirms that a Jew must
not carry a handkerchief on the Sabbath Day,
but must secure it to his wrist —a most em-
barrassing' scheme for a ’flu season.
It would stagger many to learn of the great
number of Jews in Australia who cling
doggedly to these quaint practices of their
forefathers, despite the derision invited there-
by. I know of many women of the faith
who will tramp for miles to secure meat
killed under the hygienic supervision of
Jewish specialists. This, however, is a pre-
caution which Gentiles will emulate some
day.

“C.”: “Hero worship endures for ever

I shared a bunk with a small boy at our
swimming baths, crowded in expectation of
a visit from Arne Borg. Small boys were
as thick in the water as tadpoles in a pool.

straight, opstanding little chap with

"I was in the club room. He was a tidj

folded his towel and placed it on the bathing
costume. This done he looked up and
squared his shoulders, then turned to go,
but before doing so he glanced back at me.
There was a touich of glory on his face as
he said it: “And he wiped himself in my

The confession! of “H.K.W.’s” mate Jim:
Jim took a long while to oil up the tractor on
his first morning on the farm after a trip to Sydney,
so I had plenty of time to ask him how he got on.
“Oh, all right,’’ said Jim, “in the smoke. But
things wasn’t too good when I started for home.
I cut it too fine gettin’ to the Central, and if me
old port hadn’t ha’ been dead light I’d ha’ missed
her. Before we got to Strathfield two well
mockered-up blokes knew pretty well all about
me. After a while they says, ‘What about a game ?
I didn’t want to be unsociable, and another chap
from the coumtry joined in too.
“It wasn’t long before I jerried that the two
flash blokes was on the make, and I started wonderin’
how I was goin" to get out. One of the chaps asked
me how far I was goin’, and the other says, ‘Oh,
our friend’s goin’ to Singleton—there’s plenty of
time.’ That gimme an idea. I played all I knew
—and won for a while. Anyway, when we pulled
up at Hornsby I was in thirteen quid. Then, with-
out takin’ me port, I said I’d be back in a second,
and bolted.’’
“Good-o!” I said; “so you showed a profit.”
“Profit!” snorted Jim. “After I ducked, the
other country chap squeals like a bagful o’ cats,
and the two flash-uns helps him. So the police
lumbers me and bungs me in and charges me
with being the crook. Yes, and it cost me all I
had and a fiver besides that I had to wire home for.”

“Xamilc” : Cribber’s wound was no record,
but the way he acquired it annoyed him ex-
cessively. Recalled hurriedly from leave
when things began to work up for Romani,
he was exchanging shots with a Jacko patrol
when one of the latter pinked him through
the thigh. The bullet struck a 10-piastre
piece in his trousers pocket, and, carrying
the coin with it, so shattered the thighbone

THE GIRL: “Is she very pretty?”
THE MAN: “ Rather! Why, when she steps
on to the tram the advertising is a total
loss.”
that when Cribber got to Cairo it was found
necessary to amputate the limb. The M.O.
was full of sympathy. It was the coin that
had worked all the mischief, he pointed out:
the bullet alone would probably not have
touched the bone at all. “Just my blanky
luck!” grumbled Cribber. “It’s the first
time I ever come back from leave with any
money in all the years I bin at the blanky
war. Shows yer the danger a man runs
when he saves money!”
TO ME FROM ME—WITH LOVE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
’Tis many a Christmas present’s fate
To languish on the shelf ;
But, oh, I do appreciate
The things I give Myself.
For buying Me some little toy
For which I know she’s grieving,
I thus can taste the double joy
Of giving and receiving.

. Ramsay Macdonald’s origin was just as
humble as Abe Lincoln’s. His father was a
farm laborer, but he received all his moral
training from his grandmother, with whom
He graduated as a strong Presbyterian
thinker. As a lad he cleared out from his
dour glens and went to London, where lie
caught a small clerk’s job at 12s. 6d. a week,
find robbed himself of sleep to pore over the
literature that subsequently colored his poli-
tical feelings. He even delved into the
sciences as a student at South Kensington,
hud for a while was a pupil teacher. Then
came a political secretaryship at 30s. a week,
and this turned his eyes to the House of
Commons. Journalism in Labor and Social-
ist organs added to his income, and his life
definitely changed for the better when he be-
came secretary of the British Labor partv
in 1900. He came to Australia in 1906, and
lie has been to South Africa and India; so
he has some personal knowledge of the size
of the Empire. Bar the late Lord Salisbury,
who had a very brief experience of the Bal-
larat gold diggings 70 years ago, Macdonald
is the first British Prime Minister to dis-
cover the Dominions for himself.
“JIMMY”. ASHTON, artist, of Adelaide, the
biggest force in the paint world of South
Australia for the past hundred years
or so.
“Fedor”: Lenin was the son of a former
Russian State Councillor who, under his
real name of Ulianov, figured frequently in
the political crime-sheets of the crumbling
Empire towards the end of last century.
Ilis brother, Alexander, was hanged for
alleged participation in a plot to remove
Alexander 111. in 3887. and the police nour-
ished dark suspicions about another brother,
Dimitri, and two sisters. Lenin himself
tv as always in trouble. For playing a front
part in an anti-Govermnent riot he was
kicked out of Kazan University, and after-
wards was sent to Siberia for three years.
Later on his restless demand for the Mil-
lennium earned him the honor of being ban-
ished from Russia, to which he never re-
turned openly until 1917. In his 17 years
of exile he toiled with unremitting frenzy for
the revolution. In the peace and quiet of
Switzerland he planned the ideal Commu-
nist State, and broke the record for mid-
night oil in the preparation of pamphlets in
various languages which he had acquired
during his wanderings. With all the short-
comings of a political dreamer, he was still
a remarkable character. The way he took
hold of Russia when Kerensky failed is proof
of a personal magnetism and power un-
assisted by physical or oratorical graces.
Moreover, he had the rare reputation ot
being disinterested. lie had ever lived like
a monk, and his rise to a position unique in
its possibilities never altered the astonishing
simplicity of the man.
John Fowler, Chief of the C.I.D. in N. S.
Wales, believes that no detective can be great
unless he has a
hobby, which ex-
plains why he him-
self spends his
leisure hours pot-
tering about a
P y m b 1 e orchard.
John Fowler is a
Scot, but not a
dour one. He was
a kirk pillar, and
still looks like a
good elder ; but for
all that there are
few crooks whose
history and weak-
nesses and idiosyn-
crasies are not
stored away in his
capacious brain.
FRANK GROVES,
M.L.A. for Dande-
nong, who as Vic.
Government Whip
has the ticklish
fob of keeping
a majority for
Lawson.
G. P. Doolette always kept up a senti-
mental interest in Adelaide, where 30 years
ago he was a leading tailor and hatter, and
he left instructions for his ashes to be sent
back there. His death has uncovered a heap
of reminiscences of the finding of the Golden
Mile at Kalgoorlie by W. G. Brookman and
S. W. Pearce, sent across by a syndicate
(10 shares of £l5 each, with five free shares
to the prospectors) got up in Adelaide by
Doolette and George Brookman, both of
whom acquired much wealth and eventually
titles. It fell to Doolette to proceed to Lon-
don and finance the properties there, and
he succeeded so well that he never came
back except for a visit.
Jago Smith, who died at his Bathurst
place, Hawthorne, last week, aged 81, was
the “father” of the N. S. Wales Legislative
Council and the oldest member of the Union
Club. A tall, spare man, who during the
latter part of his life always looked 20 years
younger than he was, he possessed charm and
brains and might have done as well in poli-
tics as his fellow squire, George Fuller. But
all his interests centred in and around his
native city. He married a daughter of the
original Dr. Macliattie, in whose honor
Bathurst’s chief open space was re-named
Macliattie Park—it had been Dailey Park.
They breed stayers in the West, and Jago
Smith would probably be alive to-day but
for a motor accident some years ago in which
his brother-in-law —a son of the old doctor
and himself a doctor —was still more seri-
ously injured. In his day Jago Smith was
one of the best shots in the district.
John Fitzmaurice, principal of Abbots-
holme College, Killara (N.S.W.), who died
of heart failure on Monday, was a remark-
able combination of schoolmaster, business
man, patriot and press-agent, Ilis qualities
worked harmoniously together, like the parts
of a well-made engine, and the result was a
swift forward movement by his school. He
began in 1917 by offering scholarships to the
boys of a dozen men who would join “Car-
michael’s Thousand.” In 1920 he followed
this with 50 two-year scholarships, carrying
free board, residence and tuition, to the sons
of dead Diggers. Next he extended the
scheme to 50 orphans nominated by Repat.,
and when he died he was arranging to im-
port 50 sons of English soldiers who had lost
their lives in the Great War. The origi-
nality no less than the worth of this variety
of patriotism was a great advt. for the coi-
lege, and the class of boys he attracted did
still more to raise the prestige of the place,
which should have been a money-maker of
late years. But, in any event, money was
not Fitzmaurice’s main object. A single man,
who was only 41 when the end came, he was
understood to have all along had enough to
keep the wolf from the door without working.
“Iford”: The English public schools and
universities have contributed their quota to
the first Labor Ministry. Lords Chelmsford
and Parmoor are both products of Win-
chester and Oxford; the former, as F. J. N-
Thesiger, captained the Oxford cricket XI
in 3890. C. P. Trevelyan, who is Lord
Macaulay’s grand-nephew, represents Har-
row and Cambridge. Sir Sydney Olivier
was at Tonbridge and Oxford. Noel Bux-
ton graduated at Trinity, Cambridge. Josiah
Wedgwood was at Clifton. Lord Haldane
laid the foundations of his store of learn-
ing at two universities, Edinburgh and Got-
tingen. Even Eton has an alumnus among
the Under Secretaries in the person of
Arthur Ponsonby, whose first official job was
that of page-of-lionor to Queen Victoria.
Sighted his last target, at the early age
of oS, Tom Morphy, winner of a North
Queensland King’s and representative of his
State in several big rifle matches. As a
member of the Commonwealth team that
beat the Englishmen at Melbourne three
years ago, he was well up in the averages.
A chest complaint was responsible for the
early death of the. crack Towers shot.
Tom Creer, just dead in Adelaide at 67,
was Tasmanian by origin and a born miner,
who chased all over Australia and M.L. for
good prospects, and built up a big reputa
tion. He was Well known at Broken Hill.
Norseman, Kalgoorlie and a host of smaller
fields. It was on his recommendation that
the Adelaide directors exercised the option
they held over the Golden Hope at Hamp-
ton Plains.
Australia’s oldest Oddfellow, Peter Barker,
has died in Brisbane, aged 98. Peter first
saw Australia about the middle of last cen-
tury, when he went gold-digging at Ballarat.
Subsequently he skippered many vessels trad-
ing along the Australian coast.
Himself a sixth-generation Australian native,
young James Thornley 111., of the Upper
Murray, is one of the children best-blessed
with living grandparents in this or any coun-
try. He has seven. His father, James
Thornley 11., and liis. mother, nee Rial, are
alive. So are James ll.’s father, Albert James,
and his mother, and so are Albert James’s
father and mother. On the distaff side Wil-
liam James Rial and his wife are still going
strong, and so is William James’s father,
James. And the whole seven look good for
several years yet. James 111. is nearly two
years old.
As miner, prospector, timber-getter, kan-
garoo-shooter, orchid- and plume-liunter,
George P'enrose, who was murdered by
natives of Dutch New Guinea, knew the
mainland and adjacent islands of Papua
well. He was among the first to peg out a
claim on the Lakekamu field, and later,
while prospecting in the rough country be-
yond, was “not at home” to a visit of the
Kukuku tribe—little known and less liked
liillmen, who are the most dreaded of all
Papuan cannibals. Years of experience in
handling and working the New Guinea
natives gave Penrose a good name among
them, but it availed him little when the nigs
felt like doing a little killing.
Passed aw r ay in her sleep, Mrs. Ted Glee-
son, a large-hearted little Queensland bush-
woman. As Mary Hind she was a quarter-
century ago the North’s finest horsewoman,
and a host of blue ribands and champion-
ships came her way. In 1900 she gave a
great exhibition of fencing on Venus, a
big, black, high-mettled mare of the late
Frank Daley’s. A collision with a run-
away in Flinders-street, Townsville, resulted
in the horse she was riding being killed, and
her own collar-bone broken. Yet a fortnight
later, with her arm in a sling, she rode the
big bay hunter Normanby to victory at the
Townsville show.
Kyneton (Vic.) is mourning the death of
Hugh Rawson, who had been one of its pillars
for 55 years, and was its M.L.A. between
1892 and 1900. When he beat Charlie
Young by 119 votes his supporters regarded
him as a hero for “achieving the impos-
sible.” He was in the House while Shiels
had his meteoric reign, while J. P>. Patterson
muddled through for 20 months amidst bank
crashes and retrenchment, while George
Turner minded the Treasury for five years
and three months, and while Allan McLean
(with Shiels and Iceberg Irvine as hench-
men) had an innings of 11 months. Then
he was ousted by Reggie Argyle, who raked
in a dozen more votes than he. Into his
eight years of Parliamentary life Rawson
crowded enough incident to discourse on for
the rest of his days.
Paid his last call in Melbourne, Harold
Hawkes, one of the good fellows of the
mining world. A native of the Speck, he
commenced his mining career on the alluvial
tin diggings of the east coast, and after-
wards saw service in the metalliferous mines
of the west coast. Next he went to Africa
and became general manager of the Cham-
pion Group in Nigeria. His father, still
living, was once owner of the Bismarck,
Ruby Flat (Tas.), and manager of the Arbal
Harold was 42 when the call was made.
J. J. G. BRADFIELD, monarch of Sydney’s
Harbor bridge—at the moment he is busy
sorting out a tender to recommend.
The Last Post has sounded in England
for Major-General Alfred Edward Marchant,
son of an Adelaide man. Me started active
service in the Soudan when he was only 2.1,
and was through the South African
argument. He happened to be on board
H.M.S. Calliope when she gave Westport
(M.L.) coal its great advertisement by
steaming out of Apia Harbor in the teeth of
a hurricane which strewed Samoa with the
wrecks of other ships. During the last 14
years he has been an A.D.C. to the King.
George Clowser, sec. of Vic. Public Works
Department, was worsted in a light with
heart trouble last week. The sudden call
that Minsogue, ex-Under-Treasurer, got in
dowser’s room in February last year gave
him a shock, and caused him to brood over
his own ciondition. He was only 61; and.
as he had not taken life or work very seri-
ously when his world was young, there was
an interval of 42 years between the bottom
and the top rung. His happiest years were
when he was a pay clerk, making visits
with his bag of money to reclamation a ; nd
road camps, carrying also a revolver which
was a butt for jocularity. The fBOO-a-year
clerk was a king among men; the £9OO-a-
-year permanent head a stoutish heavyweight,
outwardly cheerful, but a secret worrier.
Promotions is not always what it looks from
afar.
“0.P.H.” holds a political autopsy :
The passing of a daughter of Dicky Richardson in
a Melbourne suburb revives memories of her dad, one
of the old-time Vic. politicians, who had his ups
and downs. He first secured election to the Assembly
50 years ago, and got office under Berry in 1880.
The report of a Btoard on a land matter at Fish Creek,
Gippslartd South, caused him a few years later to
resign his Executive Councillorship, and it was the
dream of his life to get it back, and the prefix of
“Honorable” with it. J. B. Patterson came to the
rescue in 1893 by making him first an hon. Minister
and then Minister for Railways. That was the un-
doing of him. The public rose up and smote most
of the Cabinet and Parliamentary followers of J.B.
in 1894, and the'House knew Dicky no more. Shiels
described the Patterson Ministry as “doubly-Dicky ’
when Richard Richardson and Richard Baker were
included, and he proved a true prophet. The fall
of Baker meant the rise of Irvine, but Richardson’s
successor, Walter Grose, was a nonentity; and was
dropped when the House was reformed 20 years ago.
Put in his last report, at Wellington
(M.L.), Colonel J. R. Purdy, surgeon and
Director of M.L. Military Services during
wartime. Meningitis was the cause. Dr.
Purdy, who came from London, shared with
his practice an enthusiasm for collecting old
books and china.
G. E. Emery .has been made general man-
ager and Alex. Cooch assistant-manager of
Vic. State Savings Rank, and they will drop
the old titles of Inspector-General and Chief
Inspector. The bank has grown enormously
under Emery’s direction. Masonry helps to
fill in his spare hours, and he is one of the
State’s best after-dinner talkers. Cooch, as
investigator, ran a fitoe comb through Vic.
public service a few years ago.
Tom Gilchrist, sec. of Vie. Railway Com-
mittee, aims at the clerk-assistantship of
the Assembly. The Railway Committee
will, however, try to keep him by persuad-
ing Lawson to give him seniority and salary
at least equal to that of the Parliamentary
job. Gilchrist was State political and de-
partmental roundsman for the Argus be-
fore he crossed over to the Parliamentary
staff via Hansard.
THE DEATHLESS DEAD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Leave to theil- poppied fields the empty graves
That ybti have peopled with imagined dead ;
Seek them iio nloi'e beneath the distant waves:
Listed, the future echoes with their tl - ead“
fetiil will they live when ail the fulsome breath
Of penny politicians is fbrgot ;
Still will they live when kings go down to death
With their conceits and are remembered Hot i
Still will they live when all the futile sneers
Of puling, puny sots are heard no more ;
Still will they live when all the bitter tears
Have joined the salt spray of a sunny shore:
When on the brink God shakes His gaping sieve
And Time drops noiseless through, they still will
live.

ABORIGINALITIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
“Ko-i-Noor”: I agree with “X2X” when
he says (B. 27/12/’23) that a large number of our
plants contain hydrocyanic acid. It exists mainly
in the form of a glucoside, which can generally
be driven off by boiling, but not always. An
amateur chemist once undertook to drive a mob of
half-starved poddies about 20 miles over a water-
less plain. Half the distance was thickly infested
with thistles of a particularly poisonous nature, but,
being new to the plains, he did not know this.
When several animals knocked up, became swollen
and then died, after discharging a dark, evil-smelling
fluid through the nose and mouth, it dawned on him
that these were the symptoms of the deadly hydro-
cyanic-acid poisoning. He reached his destination
with 50 sick-looking poddies, the rest having passed
out on the way 7. When he got back, a wiseacre took
the trouble to tell him that any fool knew the:
thistltes were poisonous, and he (the wiseacre):
nearly became the terminus of a punch for his
pains. I can vouch for the truth of this, as I was
the drover. By the way, I nominate the
aforementioned thistle and young sorghum as
having a higher percentage of prussic acid in them,
than any other plant in Australia.
* * * *
“Ponipe”: The Daintree River, which
flows in a deep jungle-clad gorge through the
mountain ranges north of Cairns, bears a sinister
reputation for floods that are sudden and dangerous.
An old pioneer, dwelling now in civilisation hut
with his heart back in the Daintree scrubs, was
holding forth on the delights of an existence spent
along the banks of the turbulent stream. “And,
mind you,” he said, “it’s a healthy spot. Yes,
very healthy. No one never dies there; they all
gets drowned.”
“Black Boy”: The idea that kangaroos
can’t be shot from horseback is laughed at in this
part (Murchison, W.A.). Any number
of stockmen do it as a matter of course.
I have often seen it done; but more
frequently still have 1 seen ’roos shot :
from a motor-car. With good ground
and a fast car a ’roo will not run more
than a quarter of a mile. The fastest
I have seen one go is 30 miles an hour,
and at that pace he held the car (slowed
down for the purpose) for 100 yards. A
shot put an end to the chase. Shooting
’roos at such a pace is an easy matter.
To chase wild turkeys on a plain is
also a favorite pastime here. A turkey
that will rise about 200yds. ahead is
best. Put on full speed, and by the
time the bird has proper momentum the
par will be close enough. This also is
an easy shot. But when in full flight a
turkey will race right away from the
fastest car.
* * *
“H.L.S.” : Talking of greenhide,
the Paraguayans use a tremendous amount
of it; and when they want some for
anything special they pick a medium-
aged, medium-conditioned, even-colored
red steer. They stake the hide out in
the sun, and do not put anything on it.
When it is cut up they sometimes half-
tan it with kurupai-bark, three days being
sufficient. They use greenhide, apart
from making the lasso, for “coryuntas,”
which are strips about 12ft. long and
llin. wide, for tying the bullock’s horns
to the yoke, thus doing away with the
bows. Mortised poles and twisted hide
are invariably used instead of chains to
couple the teams together. The bullock-
waggons are tied to the wooden axles
witn twisted hide. And the same handy
•material is often used in bedmaking.
Sometimes the whole hide is just trimmed and
strapped in one piece on to the frame-work of the
bed; in others, it is cut into strips and interlaced,
the hair being left on and put uppermost.
* * * *
“Bill R.” ; I am sorry to find “Ita” (B.
27/12/’23> backing “Paul Cupid” in his libel against
the fastidiously inclined mong. Dogs are invariably
particular about their tucker, and though given to
dining off smellful stuff they disdain anything hav-
ing the appearance of dirt, and vigorously shake it
clean before eating. Every tyke claiming the small-
est respectability refuses the offal of any animal.
I have owned hundreds of nondescripts, big and
little, and of every social grade, in the rabbit-
extermination industry, but never knew one that
did not leave untasted the cottontail’s offensive
internal mass.
“Wyoming” (M.L.) : Apropos the statement
made by an Abo.-liar a while back that the African
mamba does not attain a greater length than 7ft.
and that the wriggler is not very formidable. I
enclose a cutting from the Bulawayo Chronicle
(27/10/’23) referring without surprise to a mamba
14ft. long. I may add that there is one on view
in the Cape Town Museum that tapes over 12ft.
YES, A WOMAN NEVER KNOWS WHEN SHE’S WELL OFF.
WIFE (reading the paper): “Here’s a man at Manly who (fives Ms wife a diamond neck-
lace. Nothing like that ever happens to me.”
HUSBAND (also reading) : “Well, here’s a man at Surry Hills who gives his wife a black
eye. Nothing like that ever happens to you either, my dear.”
There are two distinct 1 species, the black and the
green. The black is the most dangerous snake in
the world. It is very savage, very agile and can
travel with the head raised high above the ground
faster than any man can run, There is no known
case of recovery from its bite —-death in some cases
ensues in 70 seconds. This snake does not have to
•coil in order to strike—he can launch out right or
left with consummate ease when gliding at full
speed. Zulus and Basutos regard the cobra and
puff-adder (both deadly) With some measure cf
indifference; but they will not go near a mamba.
Australia has nothing as dangerous as the African
mamba or the South American “bush mastri.” Both
these snakes make unprovoked attacks.
I * * * *
! “Colub” : The 4ft. spring which “Aspro’s”
snake made to bite a horse on the lip (B. 6/12/’23)
is decidedly above the average achievement of the
ordinary wriggler. It all depends on how long the
reptile is. As a rule, it can strike a distance of
only about a third of its length, since it is necessary
for two-thirds of its body to be on the ground at
the time; and its jumping range is somewhat less
than this. It must be remembered that in such a
feat the snake is practically a dead weight, since
it cannot “take off’’ as the ordinary animal can,
but is compelled first to contract its entire muscular
system and then expand it' rapidly, moving directly
upwards rather than forwards. Thus, it is sub-
jected to a gravitational pull much greater than that
felt by the ordinary jumping animal.
* * * *
“Bad Australian”: “Centurion’s” South
American “gauchos” whom he saw drinking mate
in South Africa (B. 27/12/’23) were not a fail-
sample, as the majority of them were dead-beats
from the “Boca” or the cana dives of Rosario.
The true gaucho has about as much use for a sea-
trip as the Devil has for holy water, and knife
throwing is a rather unusual amusement with him.
There is absolutely no variety in the utensil through
which the mate is taken —the bombilla described
by “Leonard Matters” (B. 29/11/’23) is the only
kind I ever saw during a sojourn of many years
in Chile, Argentina and Paraguay. The out-back
Argentine takes mate at and between meals, and,
although he is about the heaviest consumer of meat
in the world, he rarely suffers from stomach trouble;
and, except in the case of V.D. subjects, he is
exceptionally free from the skin diseases and erup-
tions so common in the people further north, who
know not mate. Given a fair trial, I feel sure that
mate would do much to alleviate the suffering im-
posed on our western men by incompetent cooks,
bad bread and excessive quantities of ram, stag,
goat and galah consumed over long periods of time
without sufficient vegetable food to act as a
corrective.
* * * *
“Huffin-Guffin” : This is the season of the
year when limbs drop off bush trees from no
apparent cause. The calmer the day the more
likely is a big limb, tons in weight sometimes, to
be found freshly fallen. Redgum timber is most
susceptible to the habit. The young leaves are
now forming (perhaps the sap being up weakens
the timber), and a redgum forest is a very fine
sight. Apropos, the newchum settler should ba
warned not to camp under our gum-trees; it is
risky at any time, and particularly in the summer.
“Yoyang”: Shades of Marsden and Mac-
arthur! Not only did the Americans win the war
for us, but they also put the real quality into
Australia’s merino wool. Jack London, in his
“Little Lady of the Big- House,” has a hero, a
large ranch proprietor named Forrest, who breeds
cattle, horses, pigs, sheep, etc., from whose “glorious
Shropshire and Ramboullet-merino ewes the great
flocks of Michigan and Ohio” are descended. “Take
Australia,” says Forrest. “Twelve years ago I sold
three rams for 300 each to a visiting squatter, who
sold them for as many thousands each and ordered
a shipload more. Down there they say that lucerne,
artesian bores, refrigerating ships and Forrest’s
rams have tripled wool and mutton production."
Just how much do we owe to American sheep-
breeders ?
* * * *
Concerning Dobbin’s neckties:—
“Big,alia”: “Jacky Roo” (B. 27/12/’23) has
raised a point that has long been debated hereabouts
and has not been settled —and, what’s more, never
will be. Some time ago I invested my gratuity
bond in a pony and gig, and got a breastplate
among other rubbish that went in as harness. The
old hands predicted failure, though I noticed very
few of them stated a case. As overseer on public
works (mainly road jobs) 1 made it my business
to get the opinion of everyone that used a breast-
plate, and here are some of the answers: It’s
clean and cool; horse works freely; no scalds;
cheaper too; one breastplate wears out two collars
—and so on. I drove my pony roughly 120
miles last Easter —through hilly country—and he
seemed to enjoy the job. The second morning
he flinched and went the wrong way for a
yard or two, but after warming his shoulders he
was 0.K., and gave no further signs of flinching.
“Nugget”: “Jacky Roo” rather gives the show
away when he mentions that his nag “looks as well
as, or better than, the other blokes’.” In such
circumstances, the breastplate is a good substitute
for a collar; but it is only a substitute. As
soon as hard times come and Dobbin’s shoulders
stand out like badly-fitting sliprails, “Jacky Roo’
will find his breastplate has limitations. Compared
with a collar, its bearing surface is small, giving
NO GOLD-MINE OF TITS OWN.
PHILANTHROPIST: “It’s very sad. Perhaps
you are married, too?”
PTOMAINE DOSSER: “Struth! D'jer think
I'd waste my time cadgin’ off yous
blokes if I ’ad. a missus!”
it a tendency to rub the corners off the angular
type of prad. Unless the neddy is properly upho-
stered, the breastplate compels him to pull the
whole load with the points of his shoulders. If
Jacky has any doubts about the matter, let him
try shifting- a load with the point of his own
shoulder —or ask a neighboring cocky why he keeps
a separate collar for each of his nags.
(Continued on page 24.)
PIDGIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s a weird and wondrous language that they
speak in palmy isles,
Where the crafty sons of Asia lure the brown men
with their wiles,
Where you meet a score of races in some little
reef-side town,
With its manners rather shady and its morals upside
down.
Black and brown and white and yellow—there are
men of all the hues,
Short and tall and lean and rounded and as varied
in their views ;
And those peoples, fair and sable,
Know tiie ancient curse of Babel,
For the finer shades of meaning they are all content
to lose.
There the cultured city accent wastes its sweetness
on the air,
While in twenty tongues assorted men will talk and
beg and swear;
There are scraps of banished German, there are
phrases from Japan,
And the Chinese chatter shrilly as none but the
Chinese can.
There the swart Kanaka coolie chants beside his
island foam,
And the sweating tourist murmurs in the tongue he
brought from home;
Oh, it’s few indeed are able,
In those isles of modern Babel,
To converse with ease and comfort when beneath the
palms they roam!
But they have this wondrous language that is void
of form or rule;
It is slangy, it is lurid, and it isj’t taught at
school.
Though they call it “pidgin English,” yet its laws
can never vex,
For it bothers not with syntax and it gives no heed
to sex.
It calls everything a “feller,” whether stone or man
or maid,
SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE GEAR.
“Bobby, what are you doing to the dog?”
“He wants oiling, mum! He squeaks when we pull
his tail.”
And it speaks the word “belonga” every other word
to aid.
You need never toil to render
All the rules of ease or gender—
To such paltry tricks of grammar no attention need
be paid.
Of the dead they merely mention “feller sick belonga
stop,”
If he’s bald they say “’ini feller wit’ no grass belonga
top.”
It is “feller” day and “feller” night and “feller”
moon and sun,
While to every living “felletr” there “belonga”
more than one.
Black and brown and yellow people, and the various
shades of white,
All must use the talk of “feller” to be understood
aright.
Their more simple notions sharing,
In this blend of slang and swearing,
North and south have met together and have put
out Babel’s light.
If you come there as a stranger, wandering through
those tropic isles,
Where the flame of red hibiscus gleams along the
colored miles,
Where the coral and the palm-tree have inspired the
poet’s song,
And the beauty of the summer never fades the whole
year long ;
If you think that pidgin English is quite simple to
pursue,
So that, mixing slang and “feller” and “belonga,”
you’ll get through,
You will find you speak quite vainly,
For they say this one thing plainly—
“Me solly me no savee feller talk belonga you.”

“Prospector”: Those suburban pioneers
who harp on damper made with plain flour anc
water force me to grin. In 1883-84 I carried my
parcel around the Darling and Paroo country, and
soda and acid were almost universally used among
station “doctors” and “commercials.” Unless right
down on bedrock, battlers usually carried a tin of
soda and acid in the nosebag. I’ve heard ancient
whalers sigh for the old days when they built their
cartwheels out of plain flour and water; but I
noticed they invariably used the soda and acid, all
the same. 1 have tried all woods, and found gidgee,
belar and mallee the best; mulga and stringybark
the worst. The best and sweetest bread I’ve sampled
we baked in the big ash-heaps at the condensers in
the early days of Coolgardie. All the wood burnt to
a white ash, which would keep piping hot for weeks.
We put our dough between two gold-dishes, sunk
it a couple of feet into the ashes, covered it up—
and sat back confident of good things to come.
* * * #
“Nitric”: Muddy flood-waters have caused
a heavy mortality among the finny population of
the Mclntyre River, near Goondiwindi (Q.). The
river rose only five or six feet, and the water was
green, but fish up to 401 b. were deposited in
hundreds on the banks. Asphyxiated, of course.
A similar visitation occurred on the Langlo River
(near Charleville) four years ago. On that occa-
sion the water was black, due to the solution of
leaves and bark from the river gums. The niggers
long ago learned the trick of getting a haul by
muddying a pool with sticks, branches and human
feet. Unable to obtain the air they require, the
fish rise gasping to the surface, and are easily caught.
“Hopalong”: “Borom's” notion (B.
3/l/’24) that the natives of Tasmania, entered that
island from the south is highly improbable for
two reasons at least. One is that the land about
the South Pole is uninhabited by man. If, as
“Borom” suggests, a vast continent extended from
the Speck to the South Pole, the southern parts
(i.e., Antarctica) should still show signs of former
occupation. Between Tasmania and Antarctica there
are no islands suggestive of submerged mountain
ranges, as in Bass Strait and the Pacific. Then
the latter-day natives of Tasmania had absolutely
no knowledge of navigation. This suggests that
their forefathers did not reach the country by sea;
if they did, it is very remarkable that all ideas
of boats and water conveyance should have vanished
from their descendants’ minds.
“Rio”: The idea that Australians wear
red shirts dies hard in England. A recent illustrated
book, intended for a school prize or Christmas gift,
THE NECESSITY HAD PASSED.
PARSON: “And do you still always say your prayers, Jacky?”
JACKY : “Baal pray now, boss. No drive bullock now for old,
Jimmy Young.”
is called “Sons and Daughters of Australasia.” Its
colored cover depicts a boy and girl mounted on
ponies with a flock of sheep and a shepherd in the
background. Except for the boy’s red shirt, the
youngsters are possible, but the garments of the
shepherd are the limit. Albeit on foot he wears
tan top boots and riding breeches. Of course, his
shirt is red, and in his hand he grasps a long pole,
evidently the artist’s idea of the colonial shepherd’s
crook. But the climax is the figure’s headgear—
a solar topee with a wide chin strap.
ONLY A STUNT FOR A STEEPLEJACK.
THE FAT 'UN: “Not too good. Been suffering from insomnia.
Now the doctor's ordered me to try sleeping on an empty
stomach.”
THE OTHER 'UN: “ Wouldn’t risk it, old chap, full or empty.
Supposing you were to fall off?”
“The Rumpus”: Don’t you Easterners talk
any more about rapid growth. An open truck con-
taining blood-and-bone manure and some agricultural
seed was unloaded at a Westralian siding, and left
standing on a loop line. The truck had been
previously freighted with garden soil and had not
been swept out. A few of the seeds got spilled
on the floor, and a shower of rain completed the
intensive culture. Wheat, oat, barley, peas, pump-
kins, beans and weeds w T ere well on the . way when
a guard picked up the experimental plot on wheels.
The new Eden already had a colony of mice, centi-
pedes, ants, red spiders and, of course, the inevitable
snake. He didn’t notice any emus or kangaroos.
**’ * *
“Pohutu”: A few months back, when the
freezing chamber of one of the Port liners was
opened at Tilbury Dock, London, there was found
in it a nest containing a lady rat with a litter of
four healthy young-
sters. The whole
family had its winter
outfit on, and was
apparently none the
worse for its sojourn
in the artificial frosts.
Exactly the (opposite
experience befell some
rats in one of the
N.Z. Shipping Co.’s
tramps which put into
Lyttelton with her
midship bunker hold
afire. I was there
when the hatch-covers
were removed, and
after the initial cloud
of steam and smoke
had drifted away
about a dozen rodents
appeared on top of
the smouldering in-
ferno. The coal was
about 2ft. lower than
the coamings, and
some of the stowa-
ways • .had enough
energy left to leap to
healthier climes. The
bunkers had been
alight for several days before the hoses
began to transform the scant atmosphere into steam.
For a hefty grip on life, I think the rat easily takes
precedence over his feline enemy.
* * * *
“Condamine”: How long can a goanna
remain under w T ater? I have watched one resting
on the bottom of a waterhole for ten minute 3. I
thought he was dead, for no air bubbles came from
him, but he adjourned when I prodded him with a
stick.
“W.D.W.”: In
the days when Prof.
Stirling was director
of the S.A. Museum,;
one George X. had the
job of Assistant-Cura-;
tor. George was a
practical joker, and,,
knowing Dr. Y. to re
on holiday in the
Gulf, decided to cause
a stir. He notified
the press, the Gover-
nor and various heads
that a huge shark
captured in the Gulf
would be dissected at
the Museum at 10
a.m. on a certain date.
Meanwhile he rammed
an old coat with Dr.
Y.’s card in the pocket
and a pair of boots
down the brute's neck.
In the course of the
dissection, the assem-
bly was horrified when
these items were dis-
covered in the region
of the stomach. When
the death notices were
ready for print in the
dailies, the cheerful
George notified the
editors that lie had
been having one of his
little jokes. Shortly
afterwards this genius
made a really import-
ant discovery, but no
one believed him when
he announced it.
What he had discovered
was that the Aus-
tralian porcupine
( echidna) was a mono-
treme, like the platy-
pus, and not only was
it pouched, but that
it laid eggs which were
hatched in the pouch.
And, while we are on
the subject, has any
Abo. ever seen more
than one egg in the
echidna’s pouch ? Fur-
ther, does anyone know
what is the animal’s
natural food besides
ants? There are two
or three in the zoological department of the Adel-
aide University, kept there with the idea of study-
ing their habits, and they are fed on eggs moistened
with formic acid.
“ Jesmond”: Can any Abo. say why fish
will not bite when the wind is from the east?
Vic. fishermen will not go out in an easterly,
however slight the breeze. Many human beings are
out of sorts when the wind sets in the quarter
where Sol says “Good morning”; but why fish
should be affected is more than I can fathom.
* * * *
“Brumby”: A youngster surfing at Bondi
(N.S.W.) was stung by a foot length of thin worm,
made up of alternate black and white sections the
size of small beads. The tiny head appeared to
have a small hole or hollow in the centre, and two
distinct punctures about an eighth of an inch apart
were left on the lad’s arm, which was swollen
painfully for an hour or more. Can any Abo.
identify ?
* * * *
“8.V.E.”: I hate digging up a corpse.
“Baro’s” par (B. 22/11/’23) settled the damper con-
troversy; now “James Possum” (B. 3/l/’24) butts
in with a resurrection. The argument isn’t as to
what we call damper to-day, but as to what con-
stituted the original lump of indigestion. Edward
John Eyre mentions in his diary that he “mixed
Some flour with a little water and a pinch of salt,
and made a damper.” That was some time before
“Possum’s” dad made his.
» * * *
“M.F.” : In a farming district in the nor’-
vvest of Tas. a man working on road repairs was
savagely attacked by a wedge-tailed eagle and only
for an adjacent heap of road metal he would have
been badly mauled. As it was, there was some
desperate metal heaving before the eagle cried
enough. Two miles further along, on the same
day, what was probably the same eagle attacked a
draught-horse. The prad at top speed made for
homestead and stable, but, being aged, speed was
not one of his strong points. The great bird alighted
on his back and at once started to dine off Dobbin.
The owner of the nag saw the outrage at this stage
and called out to his son to get the gun, whereupon
the young man, with a charge of No. 3, promptly
brought the feathered horror down. He measured
7ft. 7in. from tip to tip of his wings. These birds
are scarce in this corner of the island, and their
habits are not widely known locally, so the district
is asking if they make a habit of attacking men and
horses.
* * * *
“Science III.”; A hen here who was in-
tent on increasing her kind retired under the
quarters and made herself very comfortable. The
dogs worried her a- lot, and a good few of the eggs
were broken, so she made up her quota where she
could. As a result, she has a happy band of 13 or
14, which includes chickens, ducklings, turkey lets
and one small crow —the Lord only knows where
she got him from. She has a very worrying time
keeping her brood together, because only the chickens
and the crow strike her own gait. The turkeys
persist in roaming all over the place, and the ducks
squat down anywhere, preferably in a puddle. At
feeding-time she works them into a corner like a
sheep-dog, and keeps the rest of the yard off while
they feed. The other ladies are inclined to be
unkind to her about the crow, and several old
dowagers have spoken sharply to her, but she insists
on keeping him in the family, and, although a couple
of months old, he doesn’t try to join his black
brethren, who caw derisively at him as he potters
around with his foster-mother. Anybody ever see
a crow raised like this before?
“Lindesay”: An argument about fencing
cropped up the other day. and the chap who was
drinking with me s < who pul up 80 a
day did well. I g attention to the
fact that such a pe either slow or a

Something with a bite in it: —
“Ko-i-Noor”: I don’t know what time-table they
keep to, but I can tell “Mordi” (B. 27/12/’23)
that centipedes do sting all right, and are very
venomous into the bargain. When I was a nipper
on the South Coast (N.S.W.) I was bitten on the
ankle. In about half an hour all of me within a
radius of about an inch from the spot where I was
bitten was a bright scarlet-blue and the leg had
swollen badly. The pain, was equal to that of
about a thousand bee-stings all in the one place.
It took the ankle six months to heal properly;
in the meanwhile, the place where the centipede
had operated completely sloughed out. By the way,
I nominate the centipedes of the South Coast as
the largest in the world bar those of Burmah.
“Nitellub”: “Mordi,” whom two centipedes re-
fused to bite, appears to possess an unnatural
amount of luck. About four years ago my brother
had one crawl into his coat, and he became aware
of its presence when it started tickling his arm
above the elbow. lie tried to get it out and was
bitten five or six times on the fleshy part of the
arm. He was in agony all night and semi-delirious
some of the time. The arm became very much
swollen and went blue, and it was about three days
before he could use it at all.
“El Dorado”: At a selection a few miles out, of
Bourke (N.S.W.) a mob of sheep became marooned
and had to be rescued from the flood waters.
PROLONGING THE AGONY.
DOCTOR : “And now about diet, you must cut
out bread, cheese, potatoes, beer, milk
puddings”
LONG-SUFFERTNG PATIENT: “ Look here,
doctor, d’ye think Em going to starve
myself to death just to live a little
longer?”
When the rescue party arrived it was noticed that
a battalion of centipedes had sought refuge on the
jumbucks. At first there was great reluctance in
handling the sheep, but after a while the first-
aid party was brushing the crawlers off as if they
were so many flies. I asked the boss how to
account for it, and his reply was that centipedes
in cold weather are as harmless as the sheep them-
selves.
“Ragar”: I have been bitten by a centipede, and
I’m not taking any chances of repeating the experi-
ence ; but, like “Mordi,” I have crushed the
squirmers against my bare ‘skin while sleeping out
in the Bananaliand bush, and once discovered the
mangled remains of one on my sock when I took
my boot off without being bitten. I’ve been told
bv more than one old swaggie that it is only the
female centipede that bites, the male being quite
harmless.
DROUGHT IN THE TOWNSHIP.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Another night has gone, a day begun!
Above, the iron mask upon the sky
Looms low and heavy from a bloody sun ;
And passing crows forget their sullen try.
A slow breeze stirs the veil of dead romance,
Hung brown and heavy in the morning heat;
Three dogs lie moveless in a seeming trance;
Grey debris chases fig leaves down the street.
Two cows —or one cow and another's ghost—
Lick hopefully about a drinking fount;
A mangy horse rubs hard against a post;
A wheezy clock begins a weary count.
So weeks of days as dreary have begun—
The same red sun upon the same grey flat.
Draw down the veil; seek not the guerdons won—
To-day will die; thank God at least for that'

show you how millions now get them.
Cleaner, safer teeth as well. You
will be surprised and delighted when
you make this test. We send it free.
That cloud is film
The dingy coat on teeth is film.
That film at first is viscous. It clings
and stays. Soon it becomes dis-
colored, then forms those cloudy
coats. The teeth's beauty is hidden
until you remove it.
Film also holds food substance
which ferments and forms acid. It
holds the acid in contact with the
teeth to cause decay. Germs breed
by millions in it. They, with tartar,
are the chief cause of pyorrhea.
A new day comes
No ordinary tooth paste effectively
combats film, so all tooth troubles
constantly increased. Then dental
science found and proved out two
effective methods. One of them
disintegrates the film, the other re-
moves it without harmful scouring.
Protect the Enamel
Pcpsodcnt disintegrates the film,
then removes it with an agent far
softer than enamel. Never use a
film combatant which contains
harsh grit.

The New-Day Dentifrice
A scientific tooth paste based on modern
reseaich, now advised by leadmgdentists
the world over. Two sizes.
Price: 2/- and 1/3
A new-type tooth paste was created
to apply these methods daily. The
name is Pepsodent. Now careful
people of some 50 nations use it,
largely by dental advice.
Pepsodent also multiplies the alka-
linity of the saliva. It multiplies the
starch digestants in the saliva. Those
are nature's agents for fighting starch
deposits and the acids which they may
form. In these ways Pepsodent is
bringing a new dental era to people
of every clime.

P[?]ers
The three grey seadogs from the Mikado’s
fleet slipped silkily into Port Jackson’s
waters on Thursday morning; and after a
friendly roar of welcome, each submitted to
its anchor-chain. Two of the vessels tied up
m Athol Bight, handy to the Zoo wharf,
and their crews have made Le Souef’s park
tlieir pleasure-ground for the week.
The State Government and the Civic
Fathers have spread the red carpet and the
least for our callers. There have been ban-
quets here, there and everywhere, and amid
the acres of plenty probably the foreign
guests hardly got one square meal, for who
among their hosts thought of including a
few Japanese dishes? Leader of the Opposi-
tion Lang declined his invitation to the din-
ner spread by the Government. Mr. Lang,
it seems, was overlooked when the invita-
tions were sent out for the cosy, intimate,
mid-day snack that the Earl and Countess
of Harrowby had with the State Ministry.
The luxury of entertaining a belted earl, his
countess and their daughter isn’t often en-
joyed in a democratic country, so, of course,
the guest list had to be exclusive; and
though no leader of a democratic party
wants to break broad with Debrett, still
lie’s got to show he believes himself the
equal of a page-full of earls and a tableful
of Premiers.
The Cullens had one of the rare dry after-
noons of the week for their garden party
on the terraces and lawns of State Govern-
ment House. Daughter Ailsa sustained the
big handshake in place of mother, who was
not well enough to come down from Leura.
Wedged in between her tall father and the
small be,-medalled Admiral, Ailsa was a
pretty sight in her sapphire-blue frock
girdled with cerise. Twinkling General
h inn recited the litany of the names from
the cards handed on to him by a tall dark
elegance who viewed the passing herds with
the air of one who, trying to sleep, men-
tally visions sheep jumping a gate.
Though dry, the day could not be called
fine, for the sun sulked behind grey clouds,
and the usually blue stretches of harbor were
a reflective greeny-grey. However, the
clouds did not efface the bright smile of the
visitors —perhaps the quickness of the smile
is to make up for their slowness in our
speech, for these sailors from Chrysanthe-
mum land are very polite. Nor did the
grey day affect the frocking. The Japanese
Consul and his graceful little wife were
among the early arrivals, his glory a tall
silk hat, while his wife crowned her nut-
brown frocking with something small and
brown draped with filmy brown lace. Pre-
mier Fuller's lady wore black lace magni-
ficently; and Mrs. Tom Bolin was a picture
m blues and greys. These two, who are
Junoesque, and the miniature Mrs. Sep
Levy, in amber tones, were the beauties of
the party. Mrs. Sep brought son Douglas’s
wife, a pretty slim thing in non-committal
mastic colorings. Naval-Commander Craufurd
brought his happy-looking lady, who wore
golden-brown frocking and millinery. The
knighted Hughes’s lady brought a" thistle-
down sunshade, and almost as fragile-looking
a daughter-in-law, who might have been an
illustration for a fairy story in apple-green
georgettes. Both the Papal Delegate and
Archbishop. Kelly gave their amethystine
capes an airing; while young Adrian Cur-
lewis put the apex on the afternoon’s glory
by wearing a resplendent silk hat and the
rest of it m quite the London mannah.
With the memory of the atrocious arrange-
ments for the last French war-boat parties
still fresh, those who were invited to the
Japanese at-home looked at their cards
rather doubtfully. But Admiral Saito and
his officers had made the very best prepara-
tions for their callers. The Admiral and
his staff stood at the head of the gangway
till the last launch-full had arrived. White-
uniformed officers took charge of groups of
visitors and escorted them over the ship.
Here men gave displays of jiu-jitsu; there
the wrestlers, looking like bronze statues, en-
gaged one another for the entertainment of
any who cared to look on. Even Australian
beer was provided as a suitable afternoon
refreshment. All the Consuls and their
wives, the Navy and its wife, and the prin-
cipal Japanese residents came to the party.
But among the fujis, marocains and organdies
the two little Japanese ladies who came in
their picturesque national dress looked most
in keeping with the cherry blossom and the
chrysanthemums that bloomed in the gayest
ot colored paper about the deck.
The at-home at Victoria Barracks was the
brightest function in the week's entente. The
president and members of the Staff Corps
mess were the hosts'; and Colonel Cox-
Taylor had seen to the arrangements. The
barrack square was dazzling with electrics;
so were the verandahs around the quarters.
Everywhere the flags of Australia and Japan
met the eye. Out in the grounds spreading
Japanese umbrellas roofed intimate two-
somes of chairs, and a long marquee shel-
tered food and nourishment for the multi-
tude. In the messroom there was jazz
after the long, long trail had wormed
past General and Mrs. Brand, Admiral
Saito, Ailsa Cullen and her vice-Governor,
the Fuller lady (in striking black raiment),
and Minister for Defence Bowden and his
wife; and in the grounds a number of the
brown seamen filled the night air with thuds
of falling bodies and the clash of bamboo
upon bamboo as they jiu-jitsued and
fenced for the onlookers’ entertainment.
Among the naval and military heads two out-
standing figures were those of “Fighting
Charlie” Cox and Colonel Lee, the latter the
oldest member of the Mess—he knew Dawes
Battery in 1888.
There was a sparkle in the air on Anni-
versary Day. The morning had a lilt to it, the
Harbor glittered like a sapphire in the sun.
and snowy sails gleamed on it everywhere. This
is the yachtsman’s great day, and he sees to it
that his gear and sailing kit are irreproach-
able. The Moldavia, the flagship, made Cre
morne gay with fluttering ensigns. Off Gar-
den Island and in Athol Bight lay the Japa-
nese cruisers—a big occasion for them, too,
the wedding day of their Prince, so they
spread extra bunting. The ferries flew flags
because of Governor Phillip, and every pier
and headland about the waters of Port Jack-
son was thick wfith boys—the old ones watch-
ing the sailing through their glasses; the
little ones fishing, coatless and bare of foot,
attached to pile or rock by a miracle or some
new force of relativity.
Father Piquet was there in charge of a
flock from the Rocks; and padres whose
collars were of all denominations, but -whose
eyes beamed with the one brand of kindli-
ness, had brought clusters of kiddies from
the ’Loo, and Chippendale and Surry Hills.
Wherever they came from the Wentworth
doors were flung wide to them, and the red
carpet down the Palm Court steps was trod-
den by 400 pairs of little feet, some of
them frankly bare, some more pathetically
in derelict footwear, but all happy. Up at
Government House there might be a vice-
regal garden party, but the social success of
Thursday was Mrs. Maclurcan’s gather-
ing ; and certainly no hostess ever enter-
tained more appreciative guests. The gor-
geous Punch and Judy show was applauded
with equal vigor by a small brown Samoan
dressed as an advertisement for a widely-
worn shirt; a slim half-Italian boy dressed
mostly in holes and a smile; and the rather
grim young humorist whose garb was a sack
ornamented with the metal tops of beer-
bottles. And the rapturous sighs of the
little girls at the glittering cabaret, and the
chuckles of delight over the lucky dip! Oh,
the small girl from Ultimo will have glori-
ous memories to talk over for weeks to
come with the dog she had insisted on bring-
ing to the party.
Say how d’ you to May Matthews, the
lady whose good-natured face is an index
to the warm heart beneath her coat. May
holds a job in the Department of State Aid
that keeps her
in close touch
wi t h the
orphaned
children of the
State; and on
her hours off
and her half-
holidays she
takes a ’bus-
man’s holiday
by sitting on
committees in
th e interests
of poor
mothers and
their infants.
She was one
of the founders
of the Sunshine
Club which
has made
dreams of days
at the beach
and in the
country come true for countless small girls
and boys of Surry Hills and the ’Loo. When
not indulging in these good works the lady
takes a keen interest in Labor politics, diver-
by activities on the National Council
of Women. The good Australian, who
among other things, is a J.P., sails for
Lurope and America in a month’s time • and
if ever she comes face to face with the
Lord Mayor of London or the Lord Provost
ot Glasgow, her remarks on the housing con-
ditions of their poor will surely make some-
body wilt.
The Lancashire lasses and lads had Lord
Leverhulme in their midst on the night of the
Lancashire Society’s concert and dance. He
danced all the jazz programme, but was
plainly bored during the concert till a Lan-
cashire recitation was announced ; then he
bustled round and fixed his acousticon. “Bol-
ton’s Yard’’ was the classic that caught the
exalted one's attention. Bolton is the Lever-
hulme native town ; and the reciter, an octo-
genarian, hails from Warrington, where the
corner-stone of the 100-million fortune was
laid.
Lieut.-Gov. Cullen doesn’t always wear the
wig in which Monte Luke’s camera found
him: this
past week he
has had to get
out the silk
hat which he
probably loves
less well. Yet
when the De
Chairs arrive
next month,
and the State
looks back
upon the
manner in
whic h the
Lieut. - Gover-
nor has done
all things
necessary, it
will say with a
little bit of
pride that its
own son was
a completely
satis factory
regent.
The time is approaching for Archgaiters
Wright to fling down the Church’s yearly
gage to the Royal Agricultural Society about
closing its doors on Good Friday. As a kind
of buttress, probably, the R.A.S. is building
itself a new grandstand of which the ingre-
dients are 1000 tons of steel and 10,000 tons
of Australian granite, and it will be ready to
hold its 7000 horsey enthusiasts by Easter
Show-time. This stand is a momentous affair,
and the Society had the G.-G., no less, to
unveil a tablet commemorating its erection.
While he was doing it on the wettest day of
last week, he unshrouded another tablet
marking the erection of the Hordern pavilion.
There was a great foregathering of men in
the basement wdien the G.-G.’s task w r as over.
Even Lt.-Governor Cullen with General Finn
faced the deluge; and Premier George Fuller
w r as another who applauded when Sam
Hordern handed over two marble statuettes
to Lord Forster as a souvenir of something
accomplished. Incidentally, it was men-
tioned that the gate money from last Show
totalled £87,100. So Legs don’t have it all
their own way. The fat bullock can attract
as w’ell as the shapely calf.
Talking of this stand brings to mind an-
other that is being built at the White City.
The tennis players followed the plan adopted
in connection with the great Albert Hall in
London, and to help raise the necessary
£12,000 sold seats in perpetuity for £lOO
each. Already 125 lrave been taken, so the
whole thing is paid for.
One of the first public functions to be
attended by new State Gov. Dudley de Chair
and his lady will be a ball on April 10 at
the Town Hall in aid of the projected Deaf
and Dumb Hostel. The British warboats
will then be in Sydney, and it is expected
that miles and miles of gold braid will be
present.
The Navy and the Army are out to make a
night of it on May 23. They are preparing
a United Service Ball, at which the blue and
gold of the Navy and the crimson and khaki
of the Military (horse, foot and air) will
form a dazzling show on the eve of Empire
Day. Major-General Brand has sounded the
rally for the first meeting in connection with
the ball.
Two English brides of the week linked up
with gold-braided ’grooms. Dorothy Lace, a
Devonshire lass, got her wedding over in the
early part of the week at St. Ann’s, Strath-
field. Her warrior was Major Baker, of the
31st Lancers, stationed in India. The Slys,
of Stratlifield, sponsored the match, and
spread the wedding feast at Glenuna. The
second English bride was Rose Dakin, of
South Kensington, and her defender is Sur-
geon-Commander C. A. Gayer Phipps. R.N.,
Director-General of Naval Medical Services
in Australia. St. Luke’s. Leura, harbored
the pretty wedding during the week-end.
Dr. C. Harvey best-manned, and Mrs. D. C.
Phipps hostessed the family wadding break-
fast.
Elocutionist Dorothy Nall became Mrs. It
B. Macgillivray, of Delhi. India, on January
12. The bridegroom, then manager of the
Mercantile Bank of India at Bombay, met
the Sydney girl while she w T as touring with
‘The Merrymakers.” She is the younger
daughter of the late Robert Nall, so long
news editor of the Telegraph.
Dorothy Howmll-Price, of Summer Hill,
slips into double harness to-night With Keith
Bentzer at St. Andrew’s Cathedral at 7
o’clock. There’s an orthodox flavor about the
union. Dorothy’s father was the well-known
padre, and Keith’s grandfather was Arch
deacon Bentzer, of Mudgee. Three oftW

Margot Cowan, who faces matrimony in a
climate where one practically forgets one has
a nose was given a handkerchief tea the
other afternoon at the Feminist Club. Dozens
of the exquisite trifles poured in, and were
banked up on a side table, to be gloated
oyer between drinks. The hostesses wm
S? nd Te M m- H ri‘f old .Yale and raven-haired
1 oulds. _ The girl of the moment wore
1 aisle,y silk frocking and a rainbow ribbon
hat, while sister Theo was in billows of leaf-
green georgette. The imposing Mrs. Mfl.
lard, who was Dons Gilliam, topped black
frocking by a liat that was almost entirely
a flaring green bow. Pretty Mrs. Chapman,
from Manly, was of the tea-drinkers: so were
Mrs. Lyster Ormsby and her sister, Louie
latham. The last, incidentally, will be Mar-
s,?eJ?kt>°r on Clavutu. Her young man
Gerald Hobbs, is another pillar of the Lever
industry, and he comes to Sydney to marry
Louie directly the newly-wed Symingtons
return.
Ellis Wynn, of Cliatswood. has just been
made happy by a whispered monosyllable
from Beatrix Stedman, of Wollstonecra.
whose grandfather, James Stedman, has given
thousands of Australians toothache.
All Darlinghurst—and that’s as cosmopoli-
tan a place as you’ll find —has been worried
over the illness of its beloved Dr. Weston
Maher. For years the little medicine-man
has looked tired out; often when a motherly
woman went to consult him about her own
pains she found herself giving him warnings
to look after his own health. Double pneu-
monia pounced on him some weeks ago, and
St. Vincent’s has been fighting grimly for his
life ever since. The danger corner was
turned last week.
The tenor Charles Hackett, who lias been
getting splendid notices in the English
papers, including liard-to-please London
Iktjth, has been engaged by Gravestock for
an Australian tour to commence in Sydney
in May. Hackett has had triumphs at
Covent Garden and the Metropolitan Opera
House, and is to sing this year at the Opera
House at Monte Carlo; and nobody not
already a success sings there. Hackett is
an American, but sings in English.
A Brisbane postscript:—
Well, Margaret Prior is married, Sir Matthew
giving the tall, fair bride away. She came to Air
tralia last year as Overseas Commissioner of the
Girl Guides, and met his Ex.’s private see., Michael
Rogers; and that was the end of her wanderings.
Michael is as dark as his bride is fair, and justifies
the old belief that there is a strain of southern
blood in Cornwall—Phoenician or some other. He
is the only surviving son of Mrs. Rogers, of Pervan-
well, Cornwall; and Margaret Prior’s father is of
Mostyn Rectory, Alfreton, England. The Girl Guides
gathered to make a guard of honor at St. John’s
Cathedral, and formed an arch with poles and flags.
The bride wore ivory satin with beautiful laee and
orange blossoms, Her veil was something in rare
old lace, and she carried a bunch of blue water-
lilies with yellow foliage and ribbons, and wore a
brooch of Queensland gems—one of her wedding pre-
sents from Queenslanders. Organist George Sampson’s
daughter Naera was the bridesmaid, in pastel pink
georgette, with silver tissue and pale-pink head-
dress. She carried a Victorian posy of pink and
blue, in red foliage, tied with pale blue ribbons.
Ivor Milne was best man. The ’groom’s archdeacon
cousin, Rogers, of Rockhampton, tied the knot.
There was a choral service, and Leadbitter played the
organ. Lieut. Turner, Lieut. Bowen and Alan
Devereux looked after his Ex., who held a reception
at Government House after the ceremony. Some
200 went out, and his Ex. gave them a cheerful
greeting in the drawing-room. Mrs. Falkner (Too-
woomba) and Vere Noyes (Brisbane) sent many of
the beautiful flowers, which were in crystal and
brass bowls; and where the wedding feast was set
Dorothy Perkins held her rosy own. The top lawn
saw the breakfasting. The figures on the wedding
bun referred to the meat trade and other pastoral
interests, in consideration of the fact that the love-
birds’ nest will be at Torilla station, outside Rock-
hampton.
In a setting of pink roses and asters, Kathleen
Hirschfield gave a tea to Marjorie Fowler. Those
who gathered were the Eric Vardrop, Hirschfeld and
Stark dames, Irma Dearden, Nan North, the Robert-
sons and Hawthorns, and Vivian Scott, of Hornet
Bank, who has just given her promise to A. J. Cot-
ton's son Victor.
Auchenflower and Albion tied for second place in
the rail way-station-gardens competitions this year,
seaside Pialba being first. Sir Matthew handed out
eulogy to those who planted a tree and digged a
well, accompanied by his own framed photo for the
winning staff.
Amid many a skirl o’ the pipes, the Brisbane
Caledonians had a concert in the time-worn Centen-
nial Hall. The bawbees thus accumulated are to
go towards buying a statue of Bobbie Burns. There
was a guid gathering, at which Jock Thompson (but
without his splendid kilt and cairngorm) sang,
and the head of the Cameron clan presided.
Phyllis Fox gave a tea for Jean Sinclair (who is
to change her name shortly), in a setting of roses
and honeysuckle and music.
Now Sir Matthew is off for a breather in Too-
woomba, where he will rest under the Rathdonnell
roof, as the guest of Dr. and Mrs. Aeneas.

The Harrowbys were accorded Melbourne's
civic blessing in the old Council Chamber,
and the guest-list had to be severely
pruned to fit in with its space limitations.
The thing teed off at 2.30 p.m., as the peer
and his feminine belongings were due to
board the Sydney express the same after-
noon. The star guests occupied the dais
with the Bruntons, and from it were made
known to each unit of the processing croco-
dile as it wriggled past the saluting base.
Mrs. Brunton’s inky marocains were bright-
ened with coral dressings on the front widths,
and she wore a black feathery hat. Lady
Harrowby smiled alertly from under a halo
of uncurled ostrich plumes frilling a grey
hat, and the crushed-strawberry upholster-
ings jarred somewhat with her presentation
hydrangeas. Lady Frances, the daughter,
was like a soft grey dove, except for a little
cape which doves don’t usually wear. She
had shaded her face with a rosy hat-brim.
Her floral, trophy was of red flowering gum.
In recognition, no doubt, of the remorseless
punctuality of our trains, nearly all the
speakers, including the visiting trio, said
their pieces as briefly and simply as possible.
Lady Harrowby cheerfully admitted that
her chief object in extending the welcome
hand to Aussie officers had been to bring
them in touch with a desirable class of
women. Lady Frances, who carries no side
at all, quickly frowned down one speaker’s
flowery suggestion that she had persisted in
her good work even to the point of boredom.
‘‘Tired, sometimes, perhaps," she interrupted ;
“but bored, never.” General Chauvel rose
at one stage to correct Lord Harrowby for
referring to the A.I.F. as having “rushed
in to help the British cause” ; his point was
that our lads were helping to fight their
own cause. (Loud cheers.) The official
group drank their pekoe at a table which
blossomed redly with gladioli; and then there
were songs by Annie Caddell and Helen Reid.
In the gathering were the Cabenas, who look
fit after their Colombo trip, and Premier
Lawson’s wife.
When the heads of Masonry gave Viscount
Leverhulme and Earl Cassillis a lunch at the
Oriental last week they found they could get
on better with the Earl —the soap peer’s
deafness is a great handicap at a table. The
son of a Scottish Marquis, Cassillis brightened
up when he noted the guid sprinkling of
Scots present, and was even provoked to spin
a couple of yarns which were no’ sae bad.
The ceaseless downpour which washed out
Saturday’s tennis menu failed to damp the
joyousness of the Kooyong Club House one-
step in honor of the visiting players. This
despite the fact that Norman Brookes,
Gerald Patterson and the Schlesingers were
amongst the missing. The theory was voiced
that Gerald had stayed away to save his
blushes, for a slow movie of himself in
action on the courts was screened during a
break in the dancing. It was the star turn of
the. evening, and, of course, frightfully inter-
esting from a scientific point of view. But
it was screamingly funny to the mere Philis-
tine eye. In his most dashing moments,
Gerald on the slow screen suggested a
marionette propelled at funeral speed by
wires; yet never even then did he strike an
ungraceful poise. Pink and blue flowers,
massed in mammoth jars, cheered the dark
Wooden panellings and furnishings of the
club rooms —the artistic handiwork of Vere
de Bavay, who had put in a strenuous day
there. The music was lilting, rollicking
stuff, which graciously forebore from drown-
ing the talking side of the jazz. Hone and
Mclnnes seemed to enjoy the dance floor as
much as the tennis courts, and Sandral also
had a good time. The S. Australian player.
Mrs. Rowm, was in black silk, and little Miss
iAkhurst, of N.S.W., smiled attractively in
frilly black. Pat O’Hara Wood’s tennis-
playing wife danced in waves of shjmmery-
blue taffetas. The Bafraclbugh pair were
present, she in blue chiffonery foamed over
with lace of the same color; likewise the
Frank Majors. Ronald Forbes and Joan Clap-
perton, the lady petalled in georgette of three
pale colorings, with her hips sashed to match.
The Albert Ground galleries were packed
to the last seat on Thursday afternoon for
the Hone-Anderson match. The South
Australian mislaid his confidence, • but
kept on smiling in the face of disaster. The
crowd barracked solidly for him, but he had
no hope. Edna Boyd won from little
Miss Akhurst, who everyone was glad to see
had put on a hat instead of a hair-band. In
this case the gallery threw the weight of its
sympathy on the N.S.W. girl. She played
the prettier game; but the Victorian lias the
strength and the experience. The vice-regal
visitor, Hester Pliillimore, who was to have
tried her luck in the mixed doubles with the
Thorold Grants’ daughter Nancy, scratched
after she and Noel Heath were outed in the
mixed doubles, but she came nearly every
day to see the contests.
Walter Manifold has now declared himself
physically unfit for further political service.
Four of his twenty-three years in Parlia-
ment have been spent as President of the
Council, and prior to this he acted as un-
official Leader of the House. The little
knight originally started out on a legal
career, but after earning the right to wear
horsehair head-dress he switched back to the
land, where he spent his days in true
country-squire style at Woollaston, a few
miles out of Warrnambool. Some years back
he transferred to a Toorak flat, and there
his wife, one of the best-liked matrons in
this State, died, tie still inhabits the flat,
and takes his drives abroad in a big grey
limousine.
Dirty weather didn’t prevent a great roll-
up for the first night of “The Barber of
Seville,” at the Playhouse, on Saturday. The
sight brought out Frank Rigo to admire the
phenomenon, and during a little speech he
expressed his gratitude and hoped it was a
promise of better times. If the little show-
should prosper during this week he may try his
luck at the adjoining Olympia while the Play-
house is otherwise engaged. The Olyjnpia is
not an ideal place, but, as the information
has been broadcasted) that Rigo has some-
thing to tickle the pfilate of the opera-lover
—for one thing, a very competent orchestra
of 30 —his crowd shouldn’t sing to empty
houses. He lias a particularly good draw
in Dawn Asslieton. Catty chatter on Satur-
day night suggested that Dawn was a late
afternoon, but she proved to have youth and
beauty and slim shapeliness.
Rupert Clarke, who put off his projected
Australian trip when his wife fell ill in Lon-
don, is now packing again, and the moment
the invalid is given a clean bill of health he
will bring her and the two boys back to their
native gum-trees.
The passing of Mrs. William Greene rvill
leave a wide gap. For over 40 years she was
the leading dance-teacher in this city, and
many of her pupils won) success on the stage.
And every year she has ’had a ball and danc-
ing display, the whole takings being divided
among charitable institutions. For almost as
long as she had taught she had lived at
Ellerslie, in Nicholson-street, facing the
Exhibition Gardens; and there she died,
after several months’ painful illness.
Little Gracie Lavers monopolised the
“Sally” limelight on Saturday night, when
the curtain rang down on her footlight career.
She is in for some whirling weeks with dress
architects and hat builders before _ keeping
her appointment w-ith Kingsley Baillieu, at
the “little church round the corner,” on
February 19. She is to be led to the sacri-
fice by her old friend Hugh Ward, while
Jack Chirnside, one of Percy’s sons, will
stand by the bridegroom.
Alec McCowan and Dr. Charles Iredale’s
daughter Dot, who will shortly honor the
contract entered into by them some time
back, have plenty of sheets and towels to
start their laundry bills with as the result
of a linen-tea staged by Mrs. H. M. Duigan
at Elwood. The hostess was in voile and
lace colored like a lightly-done biscuit and
circumferenced with blue, under a mauve
hat. The little bride-elect, in purply-blue
silk and a white hat, echoed Mrs. Duigan’s
How d’ye do’s, while Cynthia, the unmarried
daughter of the house, buzzed round in cream
silk frockings and a winning smile.
Here we have little Phyllis Best as she
smiled at Rembrandt’s camera. The 18-year-
old damsel,
having con-
tracted stage
fever in a
severe form,
has now
crossed the
footlights, and
got her bap-
tism of lime-
light in a
small part in
the final
Emelie Polini
show, “M y
Lady’s Dress.”
Phyllis, who is
the see o n d
daughter of
the ex-Senator.
is a brainy
flapper whose
sunshiny per-
sonality en-
dears her to
old and young alike. She smiles out on the
world from a halo of silky curls which almost
dazzle one by their goldenness.
Harold Austin has followed up his weight-
putting record at Cambridge freshmen’s
sports by winning the freshers’ heavy-weight
championship. He is furthermore being
spoken of in England as a coming cricket
blue. The massive youth was in Melbourne
Grammar XI, and was prominent in other
parts of the sporting arena. He is a son. of
the Ernie Austins, of the Western District,
and a grandson of the late John Macpher-
son, of Neerin Neerin. Others of the
Austin clan have come to the fore in the
world of sport, more particularly on the
golf links: one cousin, Mrs. James Gate-
house, is a lady champ.; and another cousin,
Mrs. William Bowie, the Bertie Austins’
daughter, can give Mrs. Jimmy a good game.
Harold’s cousins on the maternal side are
those Griffiths sisters who have loomed so
large in English gawfing circles of late
years.
This pleasing face, depicted by Rembrandt,
belongs to Nancy Horne, a musically-gifted
Cast lemaine
girl whose
voice and his-
trionic ability
came in for
much favor-
able comment
the other after-
noon when she
took her first
stage limelight
as Hansel at a
matiitoe per-
formance of
II u m p e r-
dinck’s delight-
ful opera at
the Playhouse.
Given her
chance she
should be
heard of later
in comic opera.
Her sweet-
toned mezzo
has been trained by Tlieophilus Roberts.
And Nancy- has a second string to her bow.
She is coming to the fore as a composer,
and is a keen student of composition under
Mona Mcßurney. Several of her songs have
already been heard from the concert plat-
form.
Mrs. James Angus, trailing diaphanous
black under jetted sheathings, provided a
musical Sunday for a large gathering of
friends at her Balaclava-road dwelling place.
It was primarily intended to gladden the
musical ear of her husband, whose eyesight
failed a few years back, as the outcome of
an accident. Dorothy Murdoch, in misty
black hangings, with paddy green side sashes
and silken slioon, unlocked her glorious con-
tralto at the head of a constellation of stars;
and young Vladinoff swept his fiddle-strings
with soulfulness. Supper was served in a
dining-room that was one large blush of pink
roses.
Robert Harper’s widow has successfully
weathered the doctor’** recent attack on her
appendix in Chelmer private hospital,
though she has still a long way to go on
the road to convalescence.
For the first time for more than two years
Government ’Ouse at ’Obart. has a tenant.
The new Administrator, Justice Ewing, is
now occupying 10 of the 55 rooms it con-
tains. He cannot afford to occupy it regu-
larly because of the cost of upkeep, which
has not grown any less because the place
has been allowed to go to rack and ruin
while it was vacant. The gardens are
largely weeds, and there was hardly a gate
on its hinges when the new occupant took his
first walk around.
Two of Uncle Sam’s big agencies for the
treatment of dental ailments in children
under 14, the Forsyth Institute and the East-
man Clinic, draw from newly-returned Otto
Bayer, of Colac, loud hosannas. The demon-
strations and practical instructions on how
to prevent tooth t e struck him as the'
most beautiful 'thing ne met on his travels.
Every school kiddie —at any rate, in the
cities 1 --now regards a tooth from which the
nerve has been taken as a whited sepulchre;
and the toothbrush drill which is part of
the U.S.A. school curriculum is followed with
the deepest interest. His wife and his daugh-
ter were with Mr. Bayer in his American
travels.
Sydney Sturt and his picturesque wife are
planning to disband their Toorak home and
leave for Rhodesia. Sydney, whose tailor-
ings are always immaculate, shed a Terri-
torial major’s rank when peace dawned, and
tied up with the W. J. T. Clarkes’ third
daughter, Nesta.
On a recent night, at the Seamen’s Mis-
sion rooms, the Harbor Lights Guild fare-
welled the parting chaplain and welcomed
the; new. The Rev. Gurney Goldsmith,
after 18 years in office, finds his health will
not allow him to carry on the good work,
but he will give the newcomer a hand until
.Tune. The Rev. J. R. Weller, who has come
down from Benalla to take over the chap-
laincy to Jack ashore, worked for some time
in East Greenwich, on the slummy outskirts of
London, and served as a British chaplain in the
Great War. Further farewells were handed to
Assistant-Chaplain Arthur Banks and his
wife, who are leaving for Hastings, where
the cleric will take charge of the Anglican
flock. Archdeacon Hindley took the chair,
but those chiefly responsible for the party
were the Misses Ethel Godfrey and Tracey,
two of Jack’s guardian angels in this port.'
That portrait of Melba in oils, which faces
the climbing visitor to the d.c. at Her
Majesty’s, is to-day about the least recognis-
able portrait that ever was. Rupert Bunny
painted it life-size, or even larger, at some
far-off time when the slimness of the song-
stress was accentuated by the dirt-gathering
length of her clinging white gown. But was
there ever a Melba who closely resembled
Rupert Bunny’s portraiture?
A note from across the Straits: —
When Mrs. L. F. Giblin, wife of our
Statistician, arrived as a Government nominee
on the Hobart Hospital Board, no opposition
was voiced by the men members to the
innovation. But they were not as gallant as
it would appear, for when it came to the election of
the oommittees Mrs. Giblin was defeated by five
votes to three for a position on the House Committee,
At this tlie Women’s organisations of Hobart are
very angry, because one of their chief reasons for
asking for the appointment of a woman was that
she might be on the House Committee, which has
the management of the internal affairs of the institu-
tion, controls the nurses and food supply, and so
on. Instead, they appointed the lady to the finance
committee. Which is so like men.
Sassiety in search of new sensations is
dropping back into the infantile. At the
Very Best grown-up supper dances the
guests must have squeaky toys as souvenirs
—bladders of weird shapes and colors that
are blown up and then collapse with a squeal.
■lt is delightful to see a large, elaborately-
dressed matron go into ecstasies and ex-
claim :“I am such a baby, y’know! I love
to hear it squeak!” One feels sure then
that culchaw is on the up-grade.
What helped to kill any chance one of the
applicants had for the £BOO-a-year job of
director of the Botanic Gardens was a “tes-
timonial” he sent from a supposedly influen-
tial friend. The point was stressed that the
applicant had the good taste to marry the
daughter of a certain politician. _ The subtle
suggestion that it would be naice to have
somebody who could be a real hostess when
the veribest called to see the latest
blooms didn’t appeal to 0. S. McPherson,
the Public Service Commissioner, or plain
John Allan, Minister for Lands. Those pro-
saic people preferred somebody who was on
terms of intimacy with manures.
Walter Lucas, some time Island manager
of Burns-Philp and now of the German New
Guinea Expropriation Board, is back in
Melbourne. It was Australia’s good for-
tune that he was at the Hague when a num-
ber of important protests were lodged by
island Germans against the Commonwealth’s
rulings. Lucas was a vehement anti-Ger-
man, by the way, long before the term
“Boche” was coined.
A line from Adelaide: —
All of our world that isn’t shivering through an
amazingly cool January on the hills or by the sea
is at Clare for the Polo carnival. In addition to
the senior and junior polo events • there was a
gymkhana that gave Phyllis Bray and Lilias Hawker
(both of them just back from England) first place
in a feminine bending race, and brought Mrs. S. H.
Ayers (he is the carnival's secretary, and works 96
hours a day to make the show the success it is)
first and Mrs. Lister Colley second in a ladies’ flag
and barrel race. The J. H. Morishes and Mrs. H.
Proekter, and the Dan Cudmores, Maxwell Fowlers
and F. W. Porters are amongst those who’ve gone up
for the fun; likewise one of the Ernest Good twins,
Fay, who has had the satisfaction of seeing fiance
Keith Angas do some excellent work for his team.
The Duncan Hugheses had a house-party at Hughes
Park, the A. J. Melroses one at Kadlunga, and Miss
Judge was staying with Mrs. Sidney Ayers. The star
item of the week, polo apart, was the R. E. H.
Hopes’ dance at Wolta Wolta —a cheery affair that
ran from dinner to breakfast.
The aerial wheel at the Semaphore struck
work for about an hour the other even-
ing, leaving those who happened to be in
its upper compartments suspended cheerlessly in
mid-air. But that’s nothing to the city man who
hung himself mid-way between two floors in an
automatic lift on a recent Saturday afternoon, and
would have stayed there till the charlady came
to clean the offices on Monday morning had not his
guardian angel inspired another tenant of the block
to forget his keys and come back in search of them.
He heard sounds of despair and blasphemy from the
lift-shaft, and organised a rescue party.
Bessie Davidson is one of the exhibitors at a London
show of paintings by British artists resident in Paris.
Of her two canvases, one'is an interior in oils, and
the other a water-color study of flowers. It’s the
firstktime she has shown in London.
Mrs. Darnley Naylor was hostess at the Womens
Non-Party Club the other day, when Mrs. King and
her daughter and Mrs. Street were guests of honor.
The two former hail from Westralia, where the
Women’s Service Guilds and the Australian Federa-
tion of Women’s Societies are their hobbies, and
Mrs. Street runs Broken Hill’s Country Womens
Association. All three are keen workers for the
League of Nations, too.
Freemasonry in Adelaide is going to have a proper
Temple at last. A North-terrace frontage of U'
feet has been secured, opposite the School of Mines,
and there a lOO'ft.-high building is to go up. The
plans show it simple and solid, with many offices
to let, besides all the latest ideas dor feeding the
brutes.

HUDSONS HEART
4? £/ie cs?ce CKearts.
In the late Autumn of 1915 came the
announcement of the Super-Six motor,
which marked a new era in motor
design.
Through the use of principles exclusive
to Hudson, chiefly the famous Hudson
Patented Counter-balanced Crank-
shaft, the Super-Six motor developed
7 6 brake-horsepower, where previ-
ously 46 horse-power had been the
maximum. This increased efficiency
involved no added size or weight.
The success of the Super-Six was
instantaneous —the public were quick
to recognise its advantages. More than
1 50,000 Super-Sixes have been sold,
and the satisfaction expressed by
owners is conclusive proof of Super-
Six performance, quality and value.
Since the advent of the first Super-Six motor many
refinements and improvements have, of course,
been made. But the basic Super-Six principles
remain unchanged, and every purchaser of a Hudson
can rest assured that in performance, power, appear-
ance and all-round excellence his car will be without
a peer.
“There are many sixes, but only one
Super-Six. 5

scientifically-designed balance weights—exclusive to Hudson
and Essex Motor Cars.

NOTIONS
"ON TOP" WITH
MICK SIMMONS
SURE CATCH TACKLE
Another couple of gallops, another couple
of furlongs and another jockey can effect a wonderful
transformation in El Dorado. In the January
Handicap, 10 furlongs, at Randwick on Jan. 19, the
son of All Black —Auraria’s Daughter finished a long
way behind the place-getters, Mont Clair, Note and
Stony, who are models of consistency. But in the
Anniversary Handicap, 12 furlongs, on Saturday, iie
fairly flew over the last quarter-mile and won in
clinking style from Kelso’s ill-starred little mare
(it was her fifth second in 11 weeks), and there
wasn’t much between Stony (a 2-to-l favorite) and
Mont Clair. He was meeting all three on worse
terms. Had he run at all decently seven days before
his price would never have been better than 3 to
1; as it was, 10’s were on offer early in the betting
and 6’s when the barrier rose. Perhaps Orrell, the
Newcastle horseman, was the greatest factor in the
sudden improvement. The profession being over-
crowded with light boys, it is the exception nowa-
days to find a jockey who can kick a slug along for
a mile and a quarter and then ride him unfalteringly
with whip and spur for two furlongs. Which is
what Orrell did.
There was a lot of mone}' for the Queensland
candidate Picardy, who had worked attractively with
El Dorado on the Thursday, but he never threatened
danger. Perhaps his 12-furlongs gallop on Friday
took a bit out of him, for he looked rather light.
Anyhow, the Queensland party couldn't have had
a bad day, for Laneffe (4’s) annexed the Flying
Handicap brilliantly from Wren’s Little Flower, to
whom he was conceding 411 b. and woo is supposed
to be a rod in pickle - for the Oakleigh Plate. An-
other impressive victory was that of Valdoona (3’s)
in the Adrian Knox Stakes for three-year-old fillies ;
it was a one-horse race from the home turn, where
Kilkenny Lass cracked up, and there were six

her as a two-year-old for 85 guineas.

Should Berrinbo be really fancied for the
Australian Cup a month from now, the hurdle-
racer will be an interesting proposition for punters
with leng memories. Time was when the Australian
tup was thought of as a likely mark for some gelding
who had been over the sticks, but of late years the
hurdle-racing entrants have usually been wiped out
of consideration before final acceptances came due.
Berrinbo is much more of a high-class racer —a
Quality” horse —than the average Grand National
champion. On the other hand, lie is smaller than
®ost of them, against which can be set the fact that
he is the more likely to appreciate the drop in the
Weights from hurdle- to flat-racing standard.

“0.K.” : One of the early Newmarket
Picks in Melbourne is Peithias, an English horse
who “broke his duck” at Caulfield t’other Saturday.
Iruly there was little in the performance to suggest
“victory in the hardest sprint race of the year,
diough there were speedv horses in the field' and
"(ithias won in good style. Probably he is now
a better, because he is a more acclimatised, animal
‘han when Elwood Fisher handled him, but it is
hot at aU clear that Lou Robertson has made
‘iithias more reliable than before. He is not
brilliant in appearance, nor has he seemed fond of
[he Flemington “straight six.” The stable backed
him on Melbourne Cup Day for the flutter that
"cue Cross won, and again he was backed heavilv
[°r the Standish on Jan. 1, when the struggle seemed
[oo much for his pluck at the finish. Peithias
[hashed sixth in the Strn’ish, old Blue Cross being
Pbced third. On paper he is not one to be rushed,
[he idea evidently is that at last he has begun to
[how what he can do. More likely than not he
[howed his best at Caulfield with a turn in the
'[arse, and will never do much better at Flemington
n an his respectable effort on New Year’s Day.
The batting on the first day of the Vic.-
N. S. Wales match at Sydney strengthened the im-
pression that trouble is ahead of the next Australian
team that strikes a wet season in England. Though
the start had been postponed for a day owing to
rain, the wicket was never really bad. Collins, one
or the opening pair, proved that by batting nearly
an hour for 16 ; Andrews, who went in second wicket
down, by playing the bowling like a book for just
on three hours. Had the outfield been faster the
Petersham crack’s 96 would have been worth 120
at least, and his side’s total would have been nearer
300 than 217. It is significant that nearly
all the runs were made by veterans who
learned their cricket before pitches began to be
covered in the interests of the offertory. Tne wickets
were well distributed among the Victorian trundlers:
Wallace, the fast bowler, who has improved, got
3 for 48 ; Hartkopf, 4 for 49 ; Liddicutt, 2 for 47 ;
and Carlton, the left-hander, 1 for 38. The last-
named had been included instead of Willis, a bats-
man, in the hope that the wicket would suit his
style of bowling, but it did not give him any
noticeable help.
The visitors’ ground fielding was good, but they
lost several chances, one very bad miss (Wallace
was the offender, and Liddicutt the sufferer) en-
abling Macartney to make 30 instead of 1. How-
ever, their catching wasn’t so execrable as that of
the home team. Mayne, going in with Woodfull, was
missed at 2 by Collins off Scott, and by Wall off
the same bowler. Then Love, succeeding Woodfull,
who fell for a duck, snicked his first ball into Wall’s
hands and out again. It should have been 3 for 2,
and a rot might have followed, whereas it was
1 for 41 when stumps were drawn. Thus favored by
the fieldsmen, Mayne stonewalled for an hour on
Saturday, 51 hours on Monday and 30 minutes on
Tuesday for 154 n.o. out of 345. His innings was un-
speakably tedious, but of priceless value to the side.
Ponsford’s contribution was 110, made in 167
minutes with the ease and sureness of a champion.
He is not the stylist Kippax is, but lie is a master
of leg shots, and his driving is superb. For some
inexplicable reason the Victorian selectors were un-
mindful of Ponsford’s powers until last year, but
when the Australian XI comes to be picked at the
end of 1924 he is certain to be one of the first
five. After Scott had rocked ’em in for four un-
lucky overs his weak leg gave way, and the brunt
of the bowling had to be borne by Macartney, who
rose to the occasion splendidly. On Monday’s plumb
wicket he bowled 208 balls, and not half a dozen
were loose ones. His final figures are noteworthy: 30
overs, 12 maidens, 36 runs, 3 wickets. On his
day—and this was one of his days—the great little
all-rounder is still one of the finest left-handers in
the world. In wiping out the adverse balance of
128, N. S. Wales lost three good wickets —those of
Bardsley, 0, Macartney, 35, and Andrews, 44 —and
it looked odds on Victoria when this page had an
appointment with a printer.
“O. Ren”: “Jamwood’s” pre-selection of
the next Australian XI calls for comment. Allow-
ing Gregory as the supplier of fast stuff, Collins
as skipper and Oldfield as ’keeper, the team will
need three good all-rounders, and I agree with
“J.” that Ryder, Kelleway and Arthur Richardson
are the men. Then a good opening batsman to
accompany Collins will be required, and as a left-
hander is desirable Bardsley must go in. Kippax
and Ponsford pick themselves, but the team lias
no room for another batsman who is only a bat, and
Woodfull must drop out. Of the two places left, one
goes to Mailey as the best “slow” bowler, and for the
variety which the attack desperately needs one
would like to see a left-handed bowler as No. 11.
That means Hornibrook or Whitty. When Hill
and Vic Richardson eulogised the Queenslander
neither had seen him put to it on “glass” wickets.
If questioned now, both, I am confident, would
admit that Hornibrook needs a lot more experience
on southern ovals. For that reason, Whitty should
go in, but Hornibrook must be sent to England.
You observe I omit Macartney. [Which is absurd.

SCOTT , the N.S.W. fast howler, who had
to leave the field after howling four
eventful overs against the Victorians.
Trekle : Herb Taylor, the South African
cricket captain, is in hospital with a serious internal
trouble and is unlikely to be able to tour England.
This is a heavy blow for a country already in the
rearward of fortune, for Taylor backs up his batting
with capital bowling, and is as good as his name-
sake, Johnny, in the longfield or at deep third man.
In 1909 he did well against an English invasion,
but in 1913 he became famous, by proving, when
hosts had failed, that runs could be made consist-
ently against S. F. Barnes. Opposed to Mann’s team
last year he batted so stoutly in the Tests that
critics pronounced him as good as his predecessor,
G. A. Faulkner, and ranked him among the 12
greatest batsmen in the world.
Tren : Australian cricketers dominated
the Lancashire League this year. Prank O’Keeffe, for
Church, was easily the best batsman, heading both
aggregates and averages with 525 runs at 37.5 ; and
Cuffe, for Lowerhouse, finished third in the aggre-
gates and eighth in the averages. This veteran first
got into the papers by doing well for Toowoomba
against Stoddart’s Englishmen in 1897. McDonald
was the star bowler, taking 112 wickets for Nelson
at 6.67 ; O’Keeffe was 26th, his 37 wickets costing 15
runs each. When the two crack Australians met for
the first time in England, Mae. topped with 57 for
Nelson, and O’Keeffe with 85 for Church.
R. STEWART, S.A. candidate for the Aus-
tralian golf championship.
Ping Pong”: The Vic. Lawn Tennis
Association’s preparations for a handsome gate in
Saturday were mined by the sudden return of J.
Pluvius. It was bad luck for the tennis authorities,
but some people took the visitation as Providence’s
reproof for profiteering’. The association had been
charging 4s. for a plain wood seat in the stand,
which was ridiculous considering the quality of most
of the tennis, and very near to highway robbery when
it is remembered that the benches are full of
splinters and are unprotected by awnings against
heat and rain. In the cheap section the unfortunate
populace paid 2s. for standing room only, but they
were asked for another sixpence, whilst the seat-
holders’ tickets went up to ss. for the semi-final, in
which unwise prophets had promised a rare go be-
tween Hone and Anderson, The much-advertised
battle lasted about three-quarters of an hour, and was
one of the most dismal exhibitions on record. Of
course, the L.T.A. couldn’t tell how the match
would turn out, but it was not entitled to charge an
additional bob for a backache in expectation of the
game becoming a thriller. The most extraordinary
thing about te nnis supporters is that they cheer-
fully risk tearing their clothes on unshaven hardwood
for twice the money the cricket enthusiast pays for
a civilised resting-place in a protected static!. I think
the L.T.A.Y. could do with some professional busi-
ness management. The blight of amateurism is over
all its arrangements. It doesn’t even know enough
to acquire a decent score board that everybody can
see, and apparently it can’t catch a wakeful score-
boy for love or mcnay. Also, its lack of umpires
is so awful that many of the rank , and file among
the competitors play their matches trusting to one
another’s honor in the matter of “outs.” As for the
infants who act as ball-boys, their unmitigated sloth
or industry—there seems to b'e no happy medium—
has put many a good man off his game.
“Linesman”: The man who should have met
Anderson in the final of the singles was lan Mclr.nss.
His success over Patterson in a long five-set struggle
was thoroughly well earned, even though Patterson
was hampered by turning his ankle in the early part
of the game. In this match, and in the one follow-
ing with the stocky N.S.W. colt, Jim Willard,
Melnnes showed tennis of Davis Cup quality. His
graceful, facile shooting of winners to all parts of
the court, and his disconcerting use of the difficult
lob-volley to out his opponent when he had lured
him to the net, proclaimed him an artist with the
racquet. Willard, who is among the Ma State’s
best, and who can be commended for his fighting
ability in troublesome situations, was made to look
like a beginner. Melnnes was superb. W ell-
armed on the backhand, and equipped with strokes
that lesser men take a lifetime to acquire, he pro-
duced tennis that is rarely seen in Melbourne. Yet
meeting his old team mate, Schlesinger, he went
down by three sets to one, failing ignominiously
against a man who, in the matter of technique, is a
ploughman wielding a shovel. It might be said for
Melnnes in excuse that his slender physique and nerve
failed after the solid warfare of the previous days,
but it can be safely urged that he lost on his own
errors rather than through Schlesinger’s superior
tactics. To my mind, Melnnes is the greatest
stylist in Australian tennis, and we have the example
of Brookes and O’Hara Wood to suggest that stylists
generally go far.
“15-30”: G. M. Hone, the towering South Aus-
tralian, who promised to do great things in the Aus-
tralasian tennis championships at Melbourne, filled
his press supporters with gloom by failing dismally
against Anderson. The prospect of seeing some high-
class play between the pair brought a big house to
the Albert Ground, but the feelings of the populace
broke out in an audible sigh as Hone industriously
double-faulted and piled up losers in misdirected re-
turns. If Anderson had been playing at his best
fhe argument would have proved a fiasco. As it
was, the tall Ma Stater did as he liked, only drop-
ping points on a few overhit drives and one or two
of Hone’s well-placed serves. All through the game
was unspectacular. Anderson’s cross-court winner
had retired temporarily for repairs, and since the
champion is almost as big a baby as Hone on the
backhand, the match degenerated into a forehand
exhibition, in which Anderson is almost unsurpass-
able anywhere. Furthermore, each man, fearful of
the other’s passing shots, doggedly scouted along the
baseline; so the connoisseurs were deprived of all
those pretty drop-shots and sharp-angled volleys
which make O’Hara Wood’s game so striking among
Australian singles players. Allowing for a bit of
nervousness, Hone thoroughly deserved his hiding,
especially as it was an answer to the transports of
the tennis claque which is ever prematurely convert-
ing goslings into swans. Hone is a young man
of great promise, but to hail him as an early
destroyer of Tilden is to see a Caruso in a musical-
comedy tenor. Until he discovers a reasonably effi-
cient backhand, he can’t hope. for international
honors. His stance for the receipt of service shows
his weakness. Like Anderson, he stands well over
to take everything possible on his forehand, thus
giving his opponent additional chances for centre
and side-lirie aces.
* * * *
“Anstruther”: Tennis is an interesting
game, but the little-known rule that a ball cannon-
ing off a net-post into court is still in play is
manifestly absurd and ought to be scrapped. Play-
ing against a young man the other day 1 returned a
hard one to his feet, and, making a wild swing at
the missile, he smacked it against the post, with
the result that it dropped back softly in reach of
my forehand. Assuming that it was dead, I let it
go, and had the point awarded against me. As the
net-post is outside the sideline, I should say that a
ball hitting it is an obvious “out.” The strangest
thing about the rule is that an umpire will enforce
it just to show his erudition, but will allow players
to hit over the net and foot-fault with impunity,
though both of these practices are strictly forbidden.
Hitting over the net is a common misdemeanor in
country tournaments, and even in first-class matches
offenders get off without a penalty.
The freshmen’s tennis singles at Oxford
this year—new men go into residence in October —
was won by Sumner of Adelaide, and he was in the
’Varsity team before the end of November.

“Jamwood” : Charlton’s victories over Borg
have lightened the task of the worried gents, who
have been collecting for the Olympic Games fund,
but a heap more money will be needed if the team
is to be worthy of the Commonwealth. Notable
absentees from the list of donors are the lawn-tennis
associations. It was hoped that they would collabo-
rate to the extent of sending their cracks to France,
even if it involved dropping out of the Davis Cup for
a year (the Davis Cup business has been overdone
anyhow), but they rejected the idea with polite
scorn. Australian sportsmen owe it to the Diggers
to cut a respectable figure in the country where they
left so great a name. This aspect of the case
might be considered by the lawn-tennis people. Of
one or two of these bodies it begins to be suspected
that their interest in sport and the sporting reputa-
tion of Australia starts and ends with the “gate.”
“Feather”; Subject to challenges and, presumably,
to ratification by the Olympic Council, the A.R.A.
has chosen the Murray Bridge (S.A.) eight and Bull,
the N. S. Wales sculler, to represent this nation at
Paris in the boat department. Before Bull’s passage
is booked, he may have to prove himself a better
man than Baynes (Q.), but the selection of the Murrav
Bridgers is not likely to be disturbed. They have
won the distinction on their merits, and are a
thoroughly good if not a great crew. Being steady-
going fellows, they can be trusted, when training,
not to let their minds dwell too much on Mademoi-
selle or the wine of the country; and being river
oarsmen, they will be more at 'home on the Seine
than would men from certain other parts of Aus-
tralia. Still, all streams are tricky, more or less.
* * * *
“Verri”: Sometimes when I read of re-
cords being broken 1 grin in delighted memory of
tne one record that stood in my name. 1. a youth
of 14, entered for the long-dive championship of a
Maori land town. There had been an obstacle race,
aim four large wooden tubs remained tethered at
intervals down the middle of the dock. Everybody
was there ; the Mayor made a speech, and the Bishop
applauded as we lined up and dived in. 1
bobbed up in a kind of dome, which I blinkingly
recognised as one of the tubs, so 1 paused a few
seconds, sank down, and came up in a fresh spot
The applause shook the adjacent hills. My mother
fainted, the Mayor thumped my back vigorously, the
schoolmasters all congratulated me furiously, and I
believe the Bishop kissed me. My record stood for
many a day; in fact, it was only lately broken by
an ambitious nephew who was determined to keep
the honor in the family.
* * * *
Archibald Bradley is again entitled to call
himself welterweight champion, having regained the
distinction, or whatever it is, from Tommy Uren
at Melbourne on Saturday. It was more of a wrestle
than a fight, the Queenslander rushing and roughing
the heavier man for an hour by the clock. But the
referee decided that he had landed most of the few
clean punches that get home.
* * * *
In his fourth meeting with the 4|lh.
heavier Godfrey, at Sydney Stadium, Bert Spar°-o
was handicapped by an injured right knee, and after
he had slipped and fallen cn it in the third round,
the Victorian did not box with his usual snap. How-
ever, his defence was fine and he was the better at
m-fighting, but Godfrey scored heavily with a per-
sistent and well-directed left. The thing went 20
sparkling rounds, and Godfrey was a good winner
at the end. There was £1731 in the house.
* * * *
“Wink”: Harry (“Ivo”) Crapp, the finest
umpire the Australian game of football has known,
is dead in Westralia. Crapp was lured from Vic-
toria to W.A. when in his prime. In both States
his prestige was unique, for always his decisions
were accepted by players and spectators' alike as
absolutely correct. He was the first man to accom-
pany a penalty with the reason for it. Charles
Brownlow has also left the game poorer by his
decease. He was vice-president of the Victorian
League and chairman of the Australasian Football
Council. In his youth he was a splendid oarsman,
and at football showed great pace and determina-
tion for Geelong ; but he will be remembered there
longer for his untiring work as secretary of the
cricket and football clubs. When ill-health recently
compelled him to retire from this joint office he
had held it for 35 years. A few days before he died
the football club committee voted him a weekly
pension for life.
A GOOD INNINGS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
"I've had a good innings”: he still was a sport,
that friend of my youth, when a-dying.
He d played the game fairly, a sterling good sort,
In all things he did he was trying.
He hit out at times whilst compiling his score:
Of rashness and caution a mixer;
>[ade his singles galore, then a boundary four,
Or blocked ere he went for a sixer.
He’d naught to bewail in the matter of luck,
Like batsmen who, timidly shaping,
Take only one risk ar.d get caught for a “duck” ;
My friend knew the art of escaping.
So, bearing in mind the philosopher’s creed
He’d learned in his battle’s beginnings,
He said what was true both in word and in deed—
“Oh, well —I have had a good innings.”
Having seen all the changes one wishes to see,
He thought of the joys he had tasted
In happy old times that were certain to flee.
Whether turned to his “profit” or “wasted.”
He knew that each day it grew harder to say
Which old times were losses or winnings ;
For pleasure you toil, and for pleasure you pay:
Enough, if you get a good innings.
Of fat luck and lean Brother Sport takes his fill,
Yes, just as it comes—he can’t pick it:
He plays on the level a game that’s uphill:
The right thing to do is to stick it.
The flesh may be weak, but his soul mustn’t tire:
His fat’nings he takes with his thinnings;
And he’s game to proclaim, when about to expire,
“Oh, well, I have had a good innings.”
VICTORIA,
O. K.

BUSINESS SEDAN
Recent improvements in the appearance and
equipment of this Sedan adapt it, more per-
fectly than ever, to family as well as business
use.
The body is swung lower to the road. A
transmision lock, knob-grip steering wheel, a
combination stop signal and tail lamp, and
other details have been added. Important
chassis improvements have been made.
Most important of all, perhaps, new spring
equipment throughout has resulted in a
degree of riding comfort which can only be
characterised as revolutionary.

THE INKY WAY.
"Wart”: The building in the grounds of Eardley
Wilmot’s residence in Elphin-road where Johnnie
Fawkner printed Launceston’s pioneer newspaper has
been pulled down. Fayvkxer’s Launceston Adtes-
tiser was first published on Feb. 9, 1829, and a
couple of years later sold to Henry Uowling, the
first printer of the Examiner, When bardie)
Wilmot bought the place where the old paper nrsi
saw the light, and built his residence, the creeper-
covered cottage was preserved. Johnnie tawnei
afterwards opened the Cornwall Hotel and then wen
across to start the first hotel and the first newspape
in Melbourne.
“Mailman”: Shareholders in the original Daily
Mail co. of Sydney, have reason to congratulate
themselves on the transfer of the paper to a '
proprietary. The Mail's first and only balance
sheet, presented about four months ago, obscured
everything except a discouraging situation, and an*
it had been accepted by shareholders, things got
worse. Now old scripholders will get one share i
a new co. for everv two they held in the ow,
so that their old £1 shares are still nominally wortn
10s. It was the best they could get after nine
weeks’ wrangling, and they eagerly grabbed tn
lifeline thrown out bv Albert Charles Willis.
“Hamer”: T. W. Heney, the new editor of Sydney
Telegraph, takes the control of a daily thunderei
very seriously, it was in the days when he would
probably rather have been what he was, editor c
the S. M. Herald, than Gov. -Gen. that he attended
a banquet and had a place by a stalwart produce
whose knowledge of newspapers was slight. doui
nalist, I think V” presently remarked the countryman,
to whom he had been introduced merely as a a i ■
tinguished journalist.” “Do you happen to write
Truth?” It was in the days when John Norton-
patches were quite purple, and the idea that he wa-
suspected of writing such things as Pin-pricks an
Prods” utterly spoilt the good fellow’s evening.

had travelled the Inky Way all his life, and was
associated with the Wingham Chronicle in the day?
when that journal was just “toddling.” Later he
went to Gloucester, and launched the Advocate.
To-day two of his sons steer that barque, and in spite
of droughts and long-winded subscribers make tnc
Harbor of Prosperity. Old-man Rye had two boy-
in the Big Scrap, and himself was of the fighting
breed. He materially helped to establish co-opera-
tion in the dairying industry of the Central Coas •

and, like all country journalists when their la-

“Intis”: T. W. Heney, who succeeds to the editor-
ship- of Sydney Telegraph, is eighth of the line-
or ninth if you include Watkin Wynne, who >»
earlier and harder times used to occasionally edit
as well as business-manage —and tenth allowing for

VIVE LE JOHNSON!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“I am not going to die until the whole world is
dry.”-— Pussyfoot Johnson.
I dreamed that my soul its bonds untied and streaked
through time and space
To the day when Pussyfoot Johnson died with a
beaming smile on his face,
And it found a world that had no use for malt or
hops or rye,
For barley-bree or the grape’s red juice—a world
that was sawdust-dry.
There was never a pub or a brewery, there was never
a sniff of ale,
Men drank iced water and frigid tea by tankard
and mug and pail.
Yet life flowed on with the same old din and the
sun serenely shone,
So I bought me the current Bulletin to judge how
that went on.
It seemed at first as blithe and glad as ever of old
I knew,
Except there wasn’t the ghost of an ad. for port or
mountain dew ;
But the smashing leader, the piquant par., the
ringing epithet
Were as thickly spread as I’d ever read in the days
when the world was wet.
’Twas not till I sought for Various Verse, and
looked and looked in vain,
That I realised with a smothered curse and a stab
of -poignant pain
There was never a line that wasn't prose I held in
my trembling hands
Between the place where the date-line goes and
that where the imprint stands.
There was never a rhyme where they rippled of
yore at the page’s head. Eftsoons
I asked of a chap who stood at the door and scanned
tlie week’s cartoons:
“Are The Bulletin bards on strike?” I cried. He
raised a pitying eye.
“What? Didn’t you know that poetry died,” he
Said, “when the world went dry?
“Into all the banks deposits roll since this Prohibi-
tion stunt,
And bookies collar a richer toll than ever from those
who punt.
It’s fine for the income-tax and trade, there isn’t
a shadow of doubt,
But the coves who the nation’s ballads made—poor
devils! it passed them out.
“No inspiration comes, they wail, for the Muse of
song has fled
Since none may quaff of the nut-brown ale or gaze
on the wine that’s red.
It’s queered,” he said, this caustic bloke, “for good
and all their lurk,
So they’ve all of ’em put their lyres in soak-
some even have gone to work.”
Then my soul returned with a hop and a skip from
those dreary days to come
When all the globe goes dry as a chip and all the
bards g« dumb,
When never a line is writ but prose and for verse
there’s never a place.
And out of a world clean purged of woes that cluster
thick round the bowl that flows
His task completed, Pussyfoot goes with a radiant
smile on his face.

“Mr. Pim Passes By,” at Sydney Cri-
terion, shows Irene Vanbrugh and Dion Bouci-
cault mistress and master of character-
impersonation and stagecraft, of art and arti-
fice. Mr. Pim, a cheerful and doddering
imbecile, drops into a prosperous Bucking-
hamshire household to convey the impression
in the course of conversation that Mrs. Mar-
den’s first husband, an objectionable person
who was believed to have accommodatingly
drunk himself to death in the Australian
bush, is still alive; and he re-appears at in-
tervals during the piece (1) to certify
(hat the gentleman he has resurrected lias
since been choked with a fishbone, and (2)
to explain that his atrocious memory for
names has led him to confuse two entirely
different characters. He is, of course, about
as bleating an impossibility as (say) the
curate in “The Private Secretary”; but
Boucicault handles the grotesque puppet with
such rare skill that the audience is presently
ready to go into fits of merriment
over a gesture and raptures of appre-
ciation over a senile grimace. Miss
Vanbrugh, as Olivia Marden, the wife
who meets every situation with delightful
aplomb, and in whose hands a husband, how-
ever little he may suspect it, is destined to
be as pliable as a pair of curtains, gives just
as easy and admirable a display of finished
acting. C. M. Hallard, as George Marden,
the rather pompous squire, dressed his part
better than he played it; but when a man

has to be torn with anguish in the intervals
of being interested in pigs, excuses may be
found for him. Miss Janet Eccles, as Dinah,
is as piquant and generally delightful a
flapper as this paper has seen for many a
day; Martin Walker, as Brian Strange, is a
reasonably effective lover; and Miss Lena
Ilalliday makes an assertive and downright
Lady Marden. The piece is preceded by
J. M. Barrie’s “The Twelve Pound Look”
as a curtain-raiser; here Miss Ethel Welles-
ley, as Kate (she reappears as the demure
waiting-maid Anne in “Mr. Pim”), shows an
aptitude and an archness that the audience is
quick to recognise, and carries off the honors.
Miss Joan Crossley is a remarkably attrac-
tive Lady Sims, and Henry Latimer makes
the best of the self-centred and woodenly-
designed Sir Henry.
“Kissing Time” is undergoing a brief re-
vival at Sydney Royal. Time has dealt
untenderly with some features of this musi-
cal farce of a French war-wife and her
filleul, but there is a double-first-class

HER MAJESTY’S.

part—that of the comic motorist caught up
in the conscription—for Frith, and only a
person soured by dyspepsia or by over-study
of State balance-sheets could resist his drol-
lery. Cecil Kelleway is also very good as the
sportive old colonel from Algeria, and Edwin
Brett gives a lifelike sketch of an army cook
on the jag. The two leading feminine roles,
neither of the first importance, are in the fair
hands of Madge Elliott and Nell Payne;
Madge’s osculatory dance with the hard-
voiced but agile-limbed Cyril Ritcliard lifts
the mercury several degrees. Floie Allan,
Marie Eaton and the dancers, Reita Nugent,
Dorothy Seaward and Jack Hooker, help to
make a tolerably bright show move briskly.
At Iler Majesty’s, Sydney, “The Merry
Widow” is still delighting the eye with
beauty anything but unadorned, and charm-
ing the ear with melody much less subtle
than that upon “A Grecian Urn.”

Pharus, the “nerve pressure” specialist at
Sydney Tivoli, who claims to banish human
ills, running from moulting eyelashes to in-
growing toenails, still appears in a
turn that is itself nine-tenths a weari-
ness of the flesh. The pick of the
latest arrivals are Joy and Juan, whose
dancing is flavored with a welcome ori-
ginality. The toe-tripping is performed
amidst Egyptian surroundings that are both
striking and artistic. Parrakeet-frocked
Estelle Rose unwinds a string of cliuckle-
some titbits, and to preserve the balance a
recitation of the sackcloth-and-ashes brand.

There is a bovrilised version of “Vanity
Fair” at Sydney Lyceum. Thackeray
mightn’t see eye to eye with the ad-man in
comparing Becky Sharp with Cleopatra and
Salome, but he would be considerably sur-
prised to find what a good job the producer
has made. “The Ninety and Nine,” which
occupies the other side of the interval, is
mushy. Hoyts show a widow tripping to
the strains of the Wedding March while her
deserted baby-son kicks his little tootsies in
the background; but years afterwards the
aforesaid nipper is a haven of refuge for
mamma. “The Acquittal,” at the same house,
displays a comic-opera screen-murder trial
with a timepiece as a -witness for the de-
fence. “The Dust Flower,” at the Strand, is
the prize “grafting” specimen this week;
and “The Covered Waggon” is engaged on a
short burst across the same screen. The
Empress tells us that “Times Have
Changed,” and the Rialto follows suit and
also warns the docile suburbanite who puts
a couple of bottles away for the Sabbath
that “You Can’t Fool Your Wife.” So long
as “Puzzlehead Marko” of “If Winter
Comes” remains at the Crystal Palace, dusty
sheiks will find it difficult to get a look in
anywhere.

Frank Rigo showed that his enterprise
deserved to flourish by brightly presenting
“The Barber of Seville” at Melbourne Play-
house on Saturday. His trump card is a
capital soprano, Dawn Assheton, whose
sweet effortless notes brought a crash
of applause with her first song. James
Paterson carolled bravely as Almaviva,
though in his opening serenade his
tenor seemed ready to leap off the spring-
board of a high note into frank falsetto.
A lack of w r armth and physique also dis-
possessed the Duke of his repute as a lady-
killer. Figaro was confidently handled by
Alexander Wright, a big plump man. Wil-
liam Reed bashed Tradition and left it howl-
ing for mercy by producing a Don Basilio
about seven feet high and wearing hair that
is only seen in a padded cell. But his engag-
ing baritone would be a passport to the
most exclusive musical circles: it was de-
lightful to hear a voice that was not sepul-
chral because it was compelled to come from
a great depth. Leslie Gordon, as Dr. Bartolo,
was a grease-painted vision of early dotage.
Athol R. Nowland was not overcome by his
responsibilities as Fiorello, while Olive Waite
implanted in the audience a strong suspicion
of the extreme youthfulness of the ancient
housekeeper, Bertha. Ezio Eost’s band de-
serves a whoie paragraph of pretty adjec-
tives all to itself.

The nightmare that follows a headache-
powder is still revealing Emelie Polini in
various wigs and moods at Melbourne King’s.
Emelie practically runs the whole gamut of
sentiment in “My Lady’s Dress” —from the
innocent archness of the Dutch flapper to the
gloomy adultery of the Russian female, who
seems to be dramatising her passion for the
Repertory Theatre. Undoubtedly it affords
a great evening for women who see them-
selves mirrored in one or more of the scenes,
while if it doesn’t arouse bachelors in
general it makes many a husband feel at
home.

“Sally” continues to work havoc with all
previous records at Melbourne Royal. To-
night will be the 164t1i performance of the
southern season, and the piece is doing so
well that the management is already wear-
ing a dazed look in expectation of being
forced to think up another souvenir.
With the return to school this week of many
of Hugh Ward’s enthusiastic supporters at
Melbourne Palace, there will probably be
some abatement in the demand for “Mother
Goose.” Maybe the management will, have
to withdraw the “Twice Daily” announce-
ment, a. change that will be welcomed by
Anastasia the Goose, who is beginning to
feel like the overtaxed heroine of an egg-
laying competition.
The argument anent the color of a pair
of stockings originally exposed by the Dame
in “Aladdin,” at Melbourne Majesty’s, has
taken a turn for the better, seeing that a
beauteous damsel is now using the hosiery
to advertise her instep and the curves above.
Otherwise there is no alteration to report
in the Williamson panto. Even the maniac
painters’ act in the lunatic asylum, which
micht admit of some variation, continues its
undeviating ambition of using a maximum of
whitewash with a minimum of humor. Like-
wise the voice of Hector St. Clair remains
as foggy as before. It seems remarkable
that a husky undertone like Hector’s can be
sold for real money, but the comedian
demonstrates that it can be done.
Little Nellie Kelly is still the choice of
enraptured males at Melbourne Princess’s,
though the siren continues to advertise a
vacancy for a soprano of larger range and
influence. And graceful Mamie Watson is
not the only offender on the vocal side. A
want of tuneful warbling is a general failing
in Hugh Ward’s otherwise handsome show.
•*" $ '!*
How a husband’s wayward affections re-
turned to the old address is the theme of
“The Inferior Sex” at Hoyt’s, Melbourne,
this week. To reach the climax of “The
Acquittal” at the same house the long arm of
coincidence has to dislocate itself, and for a
while will have to rest in splints. There is
a splendid originality about “Defying Des-
tiny” at Hoyt’s overflow theatre, the
Gaiety, on the other side of the street.
The hero is a young man who, when kicked
out of a town on suspicion of being a thief,
returns later with a forcliin to vindicate his
name and claim his girl. “Main Street,”
which hold the mirror up to portions of Sin-
clair Lewis’s novel, is refreshing in its free-
dom from gunmen and misplaced passions:
it is at the Majestic. “A Sailor Tramp,”
taken without interference from a Bart Ken-
ncdy novel, is appreciated for its English
nationality and the appearance of our old
friend Ambrose Manning in a leading pari.
“Sure Fire Flint” is boosting the motto
“Everything Waits for Him Who Comes” in
a breezy five-reeler at the Britannia. Tom
Mix, who has been somewhat peaceful of
late, is preparing an outlaw gan.g for burial
as “The Lone Star Ranger” at the Melba.
At Adelaide Royal is a new play, “The
Misleading Lady,” which gives Nellie Bram-
ley and Guy Hastings large chances as re-
spectively an American reckless girl and the
lover who tries “cave-man stuff” in carrying
her off. The leading picture in sight is
“Nero,” at West’s, sometimes spectacular,
sometimes thrilling, and finely acted by a
Franco-Italian crowd. That clever comedian,
George Storey, leads the revels at the
Majestic, _ "where also the xylophone gets
much music hammered out of it by the Mar-
imba Band. In the open—though the
weather is very various—Austral Gardens
and Williamson’s Garden Theatre compete
briskly against each other; the former has
engaged Edith Marshall, “Adelaide’s pheno-
menal whistling genius.”
“The Deacon” : Does anyone know how old
Tom Buckley, the Irish piper and actor,
really is? It is years since he was presented
with a souvenir on the celebration of his
60th year on the stage, and he admitted to
being 80 then. When Doone was trying to
get a hearing for his sugarv Yankee-Doodle
Irish plays he leaned heavily on Buckley
and the late Frank Cullenane.
“Thersites”: Real booze on the stage is
not a modern triumph of “producing.”
George Musgrove always had it, even at
rehearsals. In another management’s pro-
duction of “Camille” we began with oysters
and champagne, but the treasury couldn’t
stand the strain, and by the end of the week
we only had oyster-shells and cold tea. But
realism can be carried too far. Though
often justifiable, the use of genuine poison
for the villain is not encouraged.
“Sydolt” (Shangai) : “Wilfrido,” in my
latest Bully, says that F. Tennyson Jesse
is better known as poet and novelist than as
playwright. I went one night in London,
four or five years ago, to see a playlet of
hers that -was being staged with four other
one-acters at the Comedy Theatre; and the
memory of it has never left me. Eva Quin,
the Melbourne girl, who started her career
with Bland Holt, was the woman in the
piece, called, I think, “The Mask.” A Cor-
nish miner, hideously disfigured through a
mine explosion, is forced to wear a mask
to hide the mutilation of his features. His
young wife is planning to depart with her
lover, another miner. In the lady’s absence
from the stage to collect a few things for
the flight, the lover is surprised and killed
by the husband. Eva, from her bedroom,
throws, as arranged, another black mask,
which her lover is to wear, so that he may
be mistaken for the husband. The husband

picks it up and puts it on, transferring his
own to the dead man. Eva comes in; the
husband simulates the lover, and suggests
that they throw the body down the well. The
body is dragged out and disposed of. The
two reappear, and Eva is suddenly obsessed
with fear. Slowly she obeys the command
of the masked man to go to her room, the
light from which is the only stage illumina-
tion. Then the husband just as slowly pro-
ceeds to follow her. He stands in the door-
way a; moment, goes inside, and the door is
swiftly shut. Then a horrible scream, and
a quick curtain.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The wondrous Girl upon the Stage
Who dances now and then, and sings ;
The charmer of uncertain age,
The angel, lacking only wings,
Who treats a love-sick millionaire
As coldly as a down-and-out—
An inspiration for the fair,
A pattern she for all about!
This modest, sweet dramatic maid,
Bright paragon of purity,
What woman in another grade
Is half so lily-white as she?
And were one only half as sweet,
As spotless and as cireumspei t,
Would all the world be at her feet—
Or would she wither in neglect?
Chaste heroines who sing and dance —
The while the chorus ambles round—
Creators of a rich romance,
The stage their consecrated ground:
Pure, peerless Girls, with powdered necks,
Delightful frocks and dreams of hats,
They shed a glory on their sex —-
Who was it dared to murmur “Rats”?

Romance of Radio.
Though the past of radio is but as
yesterday , the records of its achievement
surpass the pages of romance .
Barely twenty-five years have
elapsed since the wizard of wireless
-—Marconi—succeeded in telegraph-
ing without wires over a distance of
a few miles.
To-day ether waves from giant wireless
stations encompass the globe, and radio messages
are flashed over great distances with the speed
of light, annihilating time and facilitating trade,
commerce and social intercourse.
Every ship at sea is a floating telegraph office,
handling radio traffic to and from all parts of
the world. A touch of the Morse key, and the
ether—invisible, intangible, immaterial—is set
vibrating, and its tremors awaken similar response
in instruments thousands of miles away.

“Mancam”: Gregan McMahon has an
ambitious programme of repertory plays in
hand for the coming season, and as the Syd-
ney Repertory Society cannot exist without
a large body of subscribers, it is obvious
that McMahon is skilful in persuading as
well as producing. For it needs a lot of
tact, plus the heart of a hero, to keep ama-
teurs together from year to year. McMahon
has had a wide and variegated experience.
He was four years with W. F. Hawtrey,
two with Brough, five with J.C.W., two
with .J. and X. Tait, and two or three with
Brough and Flemming; and his parts ranged
from Horace Parker in “A Message from
THE FAILURE.
“I've been working on that FitzProfitts
woman’s portrait for months now.”
“And isn’t it a success yet?”
“No. The darn thing is still like her.”
Mars” to Zou Zou in "Trilby.” He has
also “produced” for the Firm, anion a- others,
“The Laughter of Fools” (J. D. O’Hara) ;
“Little Damozel,” “Kindling” and “The Lie”
(Emelie Polini) ; “Old Lady 31” (Sara
Allgood) ; and “The Silver Fox” (Laurence
Grossmith). A Sydney man, he first mum-
med with the Uni. Dramatic Club in the
’nineties.
“Emilio Cospctto” : I have a gloomy fore-
boding that as soon as the J.C.W. opera
season gets going La Scala, Milan, will have
to shut up temporarily, and try to earn its
macaroni as a Home for Aged Faseisti. This
appears to be inevitable, for the Firm has
robbed the place of all its singers, stage-
directors, art-directors and wliat not, and is
to pay them such fabulous salaries that
they won’t like going back to two or three
lire a day, or whatever they get. Anyhow,
the J.C.W. press-agents are slowly unload-
ing the names of the captures, and it must
be an oversight if there is one who doesn’t
come "by special arrangement” from La
Scala, Milan. Yes, Signor Saltimbanco, the
great triangle expert, who has been twice
decorated by the Sultan of Yunnan; Signor
Oavaliere d’lndustria, whose achievement on
the cymbals once brought him a diamond
anklet from the Nizam of Fez; Signor Nes-
suno Sa, whose work on the drop-curtain
has not been surpassed by the champion of
Covent Garden or the New' York Metropoli-
tan —these and other immortals are hurry-
ing out from La Scala to show us how to
produce opera on true Italian lines. I grieve
for La Scala.
"Abbot IV : Rufus Ferguson, dead in Mel-
bourne of cancer in the throat, did good work
in minor parts with Musgrove's German
opera co. in 1907, the National co. at Mel-
bourne Royal in the following year, and the
J.C.W. production of "Madame Butterfly.”
Then he took his baritone to London, but an
injury to one of his legs kept him out of
an engagement for comic opera, the only
good one he was offered. Returning home,
lie filled the gap in St. Paul’s choir caused
by Horace Stevens leaving for the war-zone.
In younger days Rufus was an all-round
athlete, and members of the companies he
travelled with still talk of his skill with the
billiard-cue.
“Ex-Englishman”: Herbert Standing’s
death, at close on 80, is mentioned in the
English papers of early December. As I
remember him, he was a fine figure of a man ;
strikingly handsome, too, in spite of having
had his nose broken in a boxing match; and
was at his best in man-about-town parts
in comedies adapted from the French. He
was prominent in “Pink Dominoes” (about
1877) with Wyndham at the Criterion, a
play then considered rather shocking, though
it would hardly count nowadays. Frank
Celli, of the concert platform, was a brother.
“Topee”: I disagree with both “Borom”
(B. 10/l/’24) and “F.A.” (B. 17/l/’24) as
to the origin of “getting the bird.” The ex-
pression arose from the similarity between
the hissing of a hostile audience and that of a
dock of geese, and I recall at least one variant.
In my father’s stock company at Liverpool,
somewhere about 1805), there was an ancient
mummer named Birch. One night he was
hissed, and at the ensuing treasury he tendered
his resignation, protesting that he “hadn’t
trod the London boards for over 40 years
to be gandered in Liverpool.”
“Mancam”: The Siiakspeare Journal
has dug up the interesting fact that “King
Henry VIII.” was the first Shakspearean
production to run for more than a hundred
nights. That happened in 1855, when there
were 150 performances. An 1892 revival
lasted 208 performances, and Tree’s version,
at His Majesty’s in 1910, had to be shown
252 times. Not even “Hamlet” has
approached that record. Odd that “King
Henry VIII.” has not been done in Aus-
tralia since Genevieve Ward and W. H.
Vernon gave it in 1885.
“Norbell”: Touching “Lond.’s” mention of
the Old Vic. having produced all the plays
of the First Folio Shakspeare (B. 24/l/’24).
The series w r as begun in October, 1914,
when Matlieson Lang and Hutin Brit-
ton, well remembered here, played “The
Taming of the Shrew.” Ben Greet did
his bit, 1914-17; followed by George Foss,
1918-19 ; Russell Thorndike and Charles War-
burton, 1919; and Robert Atkins, 1920-21.
On November 7 last was celebrated the Ter-
centenary Festival with “Troilus and Cres-
sida.” “Titus Andronicus” was produced
just before that, with Jane Bacon as Lavinia.
The play had not been done in London for
65 years, and was merely put on to copiplete
the list. Lavinia was seen holding the basin
into which Tamora’s sons are to bleed, so
that their blood and bones may make a
pudding for their mother’s supper. The
management announced with pardonable
pride that not one single performance
of “Titus” had been given without a fit of
hysterics or two occurring in the audience.
The first night saw five impressionable
patrons carried out.
“Muljarra” : When Sydney sees “Tons of
Money” that palpitant farce will be served
with songs, dances and other condiments of
musical comedy. Which means that Dot
Brunton is to return to the musical stage, a
sphere she should never have left. Ward
himself is helping in the transmogrification
of the successful London piece, which hasn’t
been quite so successful in Australia. Most
of the musical-comedy hits he has been asso-
ciated with were “edited” by him before the
public made their acquaintance.
“F.A.”: An increase for wardrobe mis-
tresses is provided for in the new theatrical
log. There is no job in the business that
calls for more tact, judgment and control
of temper. Poor Mrs. Stitch is generally
working against time, and in a maze of in-
structions from principals and lesser lights.
At dress rehearsals her life is a burden to
her, and often she works in quarters that
the average shirt-maker won Id scorn. It's
nothing out of the way to see the harassed
woman going for her life amidst distracting
heaps of tawdry rebuilt rags, while im-
patient actorines allow her five minutes for
a job that would take an ordinary dress-
maker hours.
“Pat Bushie” : Passed out, at Newcastle,
Charles Ambler, who over 20 years ago
toured the Hunter district as a pioneer pic-
ture-show man, working his way up the
coast into Queensland. Then the return trip
would be made with a “change of pro-
gramme.” At the time of his death he was
District Coroner at Raymond Terrace.
“B.” : Let me add to “Abbot P.’s” list of
celebrities and others (B. 10/l/’24) who
appeared at the old Melh. Athenaeum.
There Lydia von Finkelstcin swathed her
figure in garments suggestive of Scriptural
pictures and talked knowingly of the Holy
Land. Albert Fredenthal chummed up with
THE RETORT COURTEOUS.
FIRST GIRL: “Did you make a hit with your new dance?"
HER FRIEND: “ Rather! The audience gazed at me open-
mouthed."
FIRST GIRL: “Go on! It is seldom a whole audience
yawns at once."
a piano on the creaky stage ; and one remem-
bers the pathetic round stomach of Herr
Pflcger, who gave soulful zither recitals.
Villiers, the war correspondent, was a com-
paratively unsuccessful visitor, but there was
some interest in Adelaide Detchon, the
American reciter, who was chaperoned by
Waif red Bendall. Frank Lincoln’s show,
entitled “Lincoln and Laughter,” of which
a caustic critic remarked that “one tried to
exceed the other in attenuation,” is almost
forgotten, though it was under the manage
ment of “Daddy” Lohr. Dr. Lynn, Dante
and Thurston, the conjurers; G. H. Snazelle,
the Ivennedys and the Corricks. Do Beaupuis
and Albert Mallinson were other tenants at
various times. And it was at the Athenaeum
that I hoard for the first time a Maoriland
songstress, who, unheralded and unnoticed,
filled in the blanks of Leslie Harris’s pro-
gramme. She was very sweet to look at and
very good to hear, Rosina Buckman.
“A.P.”: Have read numerous Poverty
Point references to baritone Verdi without
ever finding out what became of him. Rumor
tells of an appearance at Covent Garden,
but it was one of his off-niglits—they had
crept in before he left Australia in the late
’eighties—and he was discarded. His sport-
ing proclivities are said to have provided
him with a means of livelihood. Howard
Vernon heard that he went down in the
Titanic disaster. Anyone know for sure?
Verdi’s first Australian showing was at Mel-
bourne Opera House in 1879 as Rodolpho
in “La Sonnambula”; the rich-toned voice
lie then possessed was remembered by opera-
goers for years.
“Santander”: Pantomime is the Here-
after for dead jests. The other night when I
looked in at Melb. Palace two lads in the
O.P. wing were betting as to the color of
the eggs which the goose was laying in the
background. As I saw the long arm of
the stage-hand changing the eggs every time
the contestants looked away, it was borne
in upon my mind that the trick was pro-
hibited when Tiberius wore the purple, the
punishment being boiling lead. Yet, far
from resenting this undistinguished antiquity,
the audience is not only giggling over it at
the Palace, but is swallowing it in another
form at Her Majesty's. Here the tint of
the Dame’s well-filled hosiery is in dispute,
and the wretched turn brings more guffaws
than the latest bar-room tale of the chorus
girl and the curate.
“Thersitcs”: According to “M.R.C.” (B.
10/l/’24), I am in error in stating that
James Hay was a pupil of Charles Keii-
ningharn in W.A. Well, Kenniugham told me
he was. If the tuneful Hay was not a pay-
ing pupil he was a close personal friend:
and beyond question he had much good
musical advice and many useful professional
tips from the old Savoyard.
“Yoyaug”: Sydney’s first theatre was
opened on January 16, 1796. It was built by
convicts and cost about £lOO. Sidaway, an
cx-convict, was the contractor. As money
was scarce in those days, the price of admis-
sion could be paid in meat or flour if the
cash was not available. One of the first
benefits held in it was for the widow of a
drowned soldier. The house yielded £l2.
After building the theatre, Sidaway, it is
recorded, “became a respectable member of
society.” His playhouse was called the Syd-
ney, and its site is in the present-day
Bligh-street, then known as Beel-row.
“Portcullis”: In my view
the great weakness in “A
Night at an Inn,” the cur-
tain-raiser to “French Leave"
at Melbourne King’s, is in
the author’s attempt to sub-
stantiate the terrible power
of the god Klesh by produc-
ing the monster out of the
darkness beyond. As soon
as Klesh appears in the door-
way and captures the ruby,
the dread of the Unknown
departs and a seasonable
feeling of pantomime pre-
vails. It doesn’t take much
imagination to mistake Klesh
for gome gaudy Prince of
Evil in a panto, show, especi-
ally when the restored ruby
is indicated by a sudden scar-
let light in his brow. Dun-
sany could have indicated
the ruthless power of Klesh
by a tew words in the dia-
logue, and he would have had
a more shivery curtain by
having the rattled mariners
inexorably drawn outside,
whilst clutching tlie table-
cloth chairs or whatever else
might be handy,, in a futile
endeavor to save themselves.
The man who adapted
Jacobs’s weird tale of “The
Monkey’s Paw” for the stage
didn’t make the mistake of
materialising the Unseen.
The consequence was an
atmosphere of uncanniness
that never offered the crowd
the slightest excuse for a
titter.
“J.H.” (Lond.) : The general election hit
London theatres so badly that 10 with-
drawals were announced, including “Head
Over Heels,” at the Adelphi, “Katinka,” at
the Shaftesbury, and “What Money Can
Buy,” the newest Lyceum bellowdrama.
Great things were predicted for H. F.
Maltby’s new comedy, “Three Birds,” at the
Criterion, and the critics used up all their
superlatives, but it didn’t run three weeks.
Another dead one is “Our Ostriches,” ati
ineffable birth-control play, by? the indefati-
gable Marie Stopes. Marie was her own
press-agent, and every paper that reviewed
her “play” politely or otherwise —they mostly
did it otherwise —received a letter written in
her own fair hand ; but the public refused to
bite.
“Hamfat” dips into the past:—
If Park-street, Sydney, is widened, as is proposed,
the Criterion Theatre will disappear and Poverty
Point make another shift.- About 20 years ago, when
things theatrical were very slack, the Cri. was
within an ace of being sold for base commercial
purposes, but it was decided to remodel the old
place and give it another fly. A long list of theatri-
cal bankruptcies, including that of an American
musical comedy co., to whose aid the Yanks in
Sydney rallied nobly, was associated with this
playhouse, and one member of a partnership which
staged its tragedy there was sent to gaol. And
there were other tragedies. The Dacres were playing
at the Cri. when they decided that life had no
further attractions for them; and in Sydney’s first
experience of bubonic plague Ada Lee and another
girl member of a company which had hired the
Criterion died of the disease. That was the time
when a Sydney weekly published a full report of
the first-night performance which never took place.
Still the Criterion has long outlived its sinister
reputation among players and playgoers. Of recent
years the pretty and comfortable little house has
sported the “House Pull” sign as often as any other
show-place.
The Smiths begin at the bottom of the
fourth column on p. 1(121 of Sahds’ N. S.
Wales Directory for 1924, and there are 42
columns of them thereafter. The Browns
begin half-way down the first column on p.
SB2, and there are 26 columns of them, with
another 24 of Brownes. Of Joneses there are
19 columns, and 11 of McDonalds —which
beats the Kellys by four and the Harrises
by two. There are a lot of other interesting
things that the old house of John Sands
vouches for; and, as usual, it has done its
work uncommonly well.
HILLS OF HOME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“There are all sorts of comforts and nice surround-
ings in Park-lane, but it is not like home. Give mR
the sunlit slopes of Elizabeth Bay, Sydney." —lien
Fuller , music-hall proprietor.
Here, where the bells of Bow ring out, as of old,
Where sounds of revelry issue from Hebrew halls,
Where peers are poor (and horribly proud and cold)
And knights are as common as guinea-pigs—
London palls.
Abbeys, monuments, palaces, “storied flood,”
“(Antral roar” and the rest, of ’em—take ’em
away.
Blow your history, keep your Norman blood!
Gimme the sunlit slopes of Elizabeth Bay.
Tetrazzini, they tell me, can sing like a bird.
Here she’s right in the boom, but me she cloys.
What is her squawk to a homesick bloke who’s heard
The perfect song of the Sydney chocolate-boys?
I’d give all Covent Garden and Landon Ron.
And the Albert Hall for the sounds that 1 love so
well:
’ j'arss right along there.... One shillin’ seats all
gone.”
Ah, for the crunch of a shoe on a peanut shell!
Haply at home it’s “Standing Room Only” now.
There, jaded Tommies, freed from the cares of the
day,
Request the middleweight champ, to “stiffen the
cow.”
Heights of home —and home is a world away!
N.s.w.

its three minute intervals, someone
buys a Studebaker motor car.
Studebaker sales for the first 8
months of 1923 were 110,540 cars!

back country to the dense civili-
sation of England; from New York
to San Francisco and down to the
tip of South America—motorists in
every part of the world are buying
Studebaker cars. Studebaker’s wide-
spread popularity is not an accident.
It is the reward of a good product,

you’re right that the skipper of the Clan McTavish
when she was sunk (B. 17/l/’24) was Oliver and not
Wilson, and that only he and two gunners (lent by

some unusual qualities about its flight:—
I glanced above and saw a dove;
Far in the sunset glow.
If it could only speak
What could it tell, of the Sky and the Dell
And the journey our souls must go?
Far in the sky it flew,
Drifting with the wind,
Leaving me with thoughts anew,
Far, far behind!
An Emblem of Love, this bird is known —
Ah, if I could , fly the way it’s flown
And live the Life that has been missed for me,
Of troubles long endured, a burning soul not
cured,
And drift like the dove with the wind,
Over Desert Land and Sea 1

Sorry, but it won’t d 0... .Joyce L.: Let the “Ode”
flow: —
The life which accompanies wealth
Ofttimes is sought with sadness;
But the chief boon of life is health
And to crave aught else madness!
The great struggle for mere existence
Amidst, adversities diverse
Brings ,a joy the rich seldom sense.
And tends wrong thoughts to disperse.
The most glorious paintings we know
Are contrasts of light and shade;
In the life of the rich, there’s a sameness
That prevents such a picture being made.
If we all have our health and our strength
With minds unclogged by convention,
What need have we of spurious wealth
With incident pleasures not worth mention?
So to those who wistfully covert
Things which look good at a distance
I’d advise them their thoughts to divert
Nearer home, to a sweeter existance.

the intermediary speeds as well, the instant starting and the
regular, even power impulses that are of vital interest to the
motor car owner.

The Missing Pearls.
(By “PHLOX.")
<l d my pearls, my precious mascot
\P The necklet was given me by a
Roumanian prince, and I never
make a first-night appearance unless Wearing
it.”
Miss St. Julian, the celebrated English
actress an Australian management had been
fortunate in securing for a season, had only
arrived in Sydney the day before, with other
members of the company, and was making
her Sydney debut that evening. When she
retired for the night she watched her maid
put the precious pearls away. In the morn-
ing they were gone.
To the suggestion that her maid had taken
them Miss St. Julian turned a deaf ear. She
trusted Marie as she would her own sister,
A notice telling of the missing pearls aud
the reward offered for them was posted up
in the hotel. The head detective had just
remarked that it was one of the most baf-
fling cases he had met, when a hotel guest
came along with the startling information
that in the dead of night he had seen a very
beautiful woman tiptoe into Miss St.
Julian’s room, and just as noiselessly' tiptoe
out again with something in her hand. To
the detective’s inquiry as to what he himself
was doing awake at that hour of the night,
lie explained that the night being insufferably
hot, he had left his door open, and he had
seen the vision from his bed.
“Would you know her again?”
“Certainly, she had a wealth of golden
hair, a perfect complexion, and soulful grey
eyes. Sh—sh. There she is.”
“Miss Mountford, I believe?” inquired the
detective. “This is Mr. V T ernon. He tells me
that he saw you steal into Miss St. Julian’s
room about midnight.”
Miss Mountford laughed merrily.
“This is no laughing matter,” the detective
reminded her. “Were you in Miss St.
Julian’s room about midnight?”
“Yes.”
“What for?”
“To borrow something. Miss St. Julias
was asleep, so I took it.”
“Took what?”
"Oh, I’ll explain that little matter to Miss
St. Julian herself when I see her.”
“You know her pearls are missing?”
“Good heavens! You surely are not hint-
ing that I took them.”
“Well, there’s the circumstantial evidence,
and many a person has been convicted on
that. Miss St. Julian swears by her maid’s
honesty, and the hotel management swears
by its staff.”
"If the imputation were not so preposter-
ous, I should say you were insulting me.”
Miss St Julian then came to the door to
inquire if there were any developments.
"Oh, you’re there, Ida,” she remarked to
-Miss Mountford. “Assisting the detectives
I presume.”
"Well, the detective and this gentleman
have as good as told me that I took the
pearls.”
"Nonsense.”
‘But Miss Mountford acknowledges steal-
ing quietly into your room about midnight.”
"I went in to borrow something.”-
"What did you borrow?” asked the detec-
tive, eyeing her critically.
"I know,” said Miss St. Julian, “that
my tin of mercolized wax is missing, as well
as my pearls.”
"That’s what I borrowed, and your tin of
stallax as well, because my dressing-case has
been mislaid. I knew you wouldn’t mind.”
Of course not, but I did miss the merco-
lized wax after my bath.”
“What is mercolized wax and what is
stallaxasked the detective.
... “Mercolized wax,” replied Miss St. Julian,
is that wonderful preparation with which
we actresses regain our youthful com-
plexions. It does this by harmlessly remov-
ing the old, worn-out skin, thus enabling the
new skin underneath to show up. Stallax
we use as a shampoo to keep our hair beauti-
ful.”
"Dear me, that’s very interesting. But
you see what an invidious position it has
put you into, Miss Mountford. You’ve got
to prove to the satisfaction of the law that
you did not take the pearls at the same time
that you took—er—borrowed the mercolized
wax and stallax. You must not leav6 this
office until the mystery has been cleared up.”
Then I am under arrest. It’s monstfous.”
Miss St. Julian was wanted in afiother
e rection. Other detectives had been follow-
ing up another clue. The housemaid who
attended to Miss St. Julian’s room find a
porter in the hotel were soon to be married
and leave for San Francisco. Their respec-
tive rooms had been searched, but nothing
had been found. Still, Detective Murphy
wasn't satisfied. He again visited the girl’s
room.
"Why did you give the pearls to Jenkins?”
he asked her.
“I didn’t give the peai.s to Mr. Jenkins,”
she replied defiantly.
Murphy never took his eyes off the girl,
and presently her eyes wandered to a boot-
shelf m the room. Murphy lifted up the
loots, and several of the pearls which had
been unstrung dropped from the boots to
, floor. "Are all the pearls here?” he
aAced.
Yes, every one, and Mr. Jenkins knows
nothing about my taking them,” cried the
girl, sobbing violently.
I arrest you in the King’s name, Beatrice
Turner.
.r The ,, he , a<i detective apologised to Miss
lountford, apd at the same time advised
ner not to again borrow toilet preparations
nom a friend on the same uight that her
jewels axe stolen.— Advt. (-5

“Veedee FI.” : At least one man in Christ-
church (M.L.) has a poor opinion of the
strength of the Pussyfoots. He has just
paid £20,000 for a 20 years’ lease of a pub
which relies wholly on its bar trade for
profits.
* * * *
“Ulaid” : Apropos falls. My master-painter
is uttering the short-handed contractor’s
growl. One of his men has just fallen from
the third or fourth rung of a ladder and
broken an arm. “Carelessness!” he roared.
“It’s not safe now to let a man go up less
than 40 feet!”
* * * *
“Wart” : A rep. of Henry Ford has come
to Australia to consider the prospects for a
local factory. His first selection was New-
castle, but the frequency of labor troubles
there made him cast his eyes across the
Straits to Tasmania. He has been offered
a site, five acres in extent at Newnham, a
northern suburb of Launceston. Besides
comparative freedom from strikes he smells
cheap hydro-electric power there.
* * * *
“Henry Bateson”: It costs money to get
at timber in most parts of M.L., but the
record is probably held by the co. which
works the Kauaeranga Valley, in the King
Country. It spent £60.000 before a single
log was hauled out. Most of the money
went in blasting solid rock to widen an Bft.
channel into a 45ft. one. Yet the high price
of kauris has made the proposition a paying
one.
* * * *
“Ingomar” : Victoria is not the only State
where railway returns are reduced by motor
competition. In the Speck a daily ’bus ser-
vice is maintained over 200 miles from
Hobart via Launceston to Burnie, while all
over the island smaller concerns are keeping
goods and passengers off the trains and cut-
ting the roads to pieces. In the Huon dis-
trict the former incessant clamor for a rail-
way has died away with the arrival of this sub-
stitute. Meanwhile, the Government, instead
of making the roads self-supporting by charg-
ing proper license fees, merely complains
bitterly of the unfair competition of motor
traffic, and talks of closing down some rail-
ways.
* * * *
“Ashmead”: The recent progress of the
Tamar (Tas.) as a port has been pheno-
menal. Just over three years ago the Com-
monwealth tramp Booral called into the river
to pick up a load of wool; and since then
89 deep-sea boats have made a call. In the
year just closed 52 such steamers entered,
compared with 22 in 1922. Now that the
Porpoise Rock is out of the way, big ships
can enter the river. This Christmas the
Stanley Hall (4144 tons) from America
steamed right up to the Launceston wharves.
Where else in Australasia can a 4000-tonncr
be navigated for 40 miles from the sea?
With a length of 391 feet and a draught of
18ft. 6in. this boat negotiated the river with-
out difficulty.
* * * *
“Herodot” : Another attempt has been made
lately to locate the boxes of gold coin said
to have been removed from Government
House in Rabaul, and cached in a safe place,
just before the occupation of that town by
Australian troops in 1914. It’s a picturesque
story that will die hard. That there was a
large sum in gold in the keeping of the Ger-
man officials just prior to the arrival of the
troops is undoubted, but whether it was ever
abstracted from the Government offices and
secretly hidden is another matter. Certainly
the money never figured on any official list of
property taken over from the enemy, but this
is by no means to say that it is in subter-
ranean deposit. Some of the Germans had
plenty of opportunities for getting away with
it—and there were others.
“Lester Way”: “Te Babarantiko” (B.
27/12/’23) shows ignorance of cane-growing
conditions on the Johnstone River when he
says that “stand-over” cane increases in
value. Perhaps he is thinking of the N.S.W.
Northern Rivers, where it takes two years to
grow a crop. In the Innisfail district plant
cane is at its best in 12 or 15 months, and
ratoon cane comes much earlier to maturity.
If it is left longer than this it deteriorates.
In a normal year, with a rainfall of 150 to
200 inches, it does become “next to value-
less,” losing nearly all its sugar. Much of
it dies, too. One crop in this district stood
25 tons to the acre last year, was left over,
and this year cut only five tons to the acre.
As to stand-over cane being pest-resistant,
that is silly. No cane is pest-resistant in
itself. The cultivation does the resisting,
and a paddock of dying cane left uncultivated
for a full 12 months is a paradise for pests.

“T. 0.1.”: Re the shortage of coins of
small denomination in the early days (B.
17/l/'24), Tooth’s, the brewing firm, tried
in 1852 to relieve the situation. They
offered £lO,OOO for £5OOO worth of pennies if
delivered at the brewery in Parramatta-
street —now George-street West —by a certain
date. I cannot say if this handsome com-
mission was ever earned; perhaps some
reader can settle the point.
It is just as well sometimes to remember
that there was a war. The highly respectable
Adelaide shipping agency firm of George
Wills found itself in the. police court re-
cently for “allowing prohibited persons to
enter the Commonwealth.” The Hagen
arrived from Brisbane in October with a
crew of four British and 52 Germans; two
of the latter cleared out and are still miss-
ing. The fine in each case was £lOO with
£1 costs. *
“Henry Bateson”: In a recent Bulletin
“H.M.” declared that Australia’s first
church, at the intersection of Hunter and
Bligh streets, Sydney, was burnt down in
1793. It was opened in that year, and not
burnt down until 1798. The Rev. Richard
Johnson’s first sermon was a vigorous denun-
ciation of the Government —and a thing like
that demanded considerable nerve in those
days. But prior to the building of the church
services had been held in the open air and m
a carpenter’s shop at Parramatta.
“Top Rail”: Among queer army orders
(B. 17/l/’24) the one read out on board
ship on the eve of Anzac would take some
beating. I forget the rigmarole, but remem-
ber the definite admonitions about the neces-
sity of being courteous to the Turkish women
who would be found in the villages on Gallip.
I’m not quite sure whether one had to take
his boots off before entering houses, but
something had to be done with them. It
was a strange prologue to that little chapter
of the Book of Hell.
A cry from her uncle: —
I wish the rags that rhapsodise inanely on the
Sydney flapper would have a -lucid interval ahd
advise the object of their infatuation not to wear
black or brown suede shoes with light-colored
stockings. Even a shapely ankle looks untidy when
dabbed with shoe-polish, and forests of ankles so
dabbed and advertised have no claim to beauty.
In the course of mv researches in trams and ferry-
boats I have seen nasty splurges of shoe-polish as
far north of the ankle as the knee. I suppose it
is the result of the restless limb-movements which
are the fashion nowadays, but a stranger might con-
clude from the appearance of the average Sydney
business girl at 5 p.m. or thereabouts that she
spent the day playing “foots.”
“Harold II.”: The large number of drown-
ing cases in N. S. Wales this summer sug-
gests that the present generation knows less
about swimming than the last. Surfing is
responsible. Where people went into the
water for a swim they now go for a splash;
and even at the regulation swimming parades
for schools very little instruction is given
in the art of keeping afloat in deep water.
A beach official at Manly a while ago cal-
culated that no more than 3 p.c. of those
who go into the water there are swimmers;
and the habitual surfer who never -ventures
into a deep bath gets little chance of learn-
ing even the dog-paddle.
“Frescott”: Re lodge doctors (B.
27/12/’23). Once, while secretary of a
lodge of 26 members, I received an intima-
tion from our medical officer that he must
have his fee increased from 355. to at least
455. per annum. Thereupon I worked out
a scheme whereby members paid to a special
medical fund Bs. 9d. per quarter, and dis-
pensed with the retained doctor altogether.
When a member required professional ser-
vice he paid for it at the usual rate of 10s.
6d. per visit, and was reimbursed by the
lodge. At the end of the first year we found
that our doctor’s and chemist’s fees amounted
to £3O 10s., leaving us a credit balance of
£l5 10s., which would have gone to the doctor
.under the old arrangement. I admit there
are members who take advantage of being
entitled to free medical attention, but there
is a vast majority who do not.
“Yoyang”: The whaling industry began
long before Captain J. G. Collins came to
Australian in 1833 (B. 10/l/’24i. Gov.
Phillip, in a letter written in 1791, refers
to the prospects of the industry, and Mrs.
Macarthur, in the same year, placed it on
record that “spermaceti l whale abound on
our coast, and the couvict transports are
engaging in the industry.” Certain rights
had been reserved for the East India Co.-,
but in 1793 a British Act allowed whalers
to operate as far westward as 180 deg. east,
and in 1801 they were given further liberty
provided the ship’s journals were passed over
to the E.I.C. on their return to England.
An Act of 1802 went further, and permitted
British-built whalers to work in the Pacific
without license from the E.I.C. or South
Sea companies. Eight years later 19 ships
visited Sydney inside 12 months, of which
six were whalers. As early as 1799 a great
whale made its appearance in Sydney Har-
bor, where it attacked and capsized a boat,
drowning three men.
A tale from the West: —
A dismal story of going on the land has been .told by
a young woman to the Commission which is inquir-
ing into the tragedy of Kendenup, the bit of West-
ralia which was bought from the State at £1 per
acre or so, and so gloriously high-financed that
settlers undertoc* to pay up to £ll or £l2 for
the earth and the promised contingent advantages.
She and her husband came from England and found
Kendenup waiting for them. She had £543 and
her husband had money besides. They bought 64
acres of the new Paradise from an agent; also two
high-interest-bearing £lOO debentures, (The agent
stated in his evidence that he was to get 25 per
cent, of all the land-sale money and £5 for each
£lOO debenture sold.) The clearing of the land
was to cost only £3 per acre, but the price went
up. It had been stated by advertisement, the
witness testified, that Kendenup land had the habit
of producing 20 tons of potatoes per acre annually.
The agent said he knew very little about the quality
of the land, and didn’t know how the 20-ton tale
crawled into circulation. The average potato
yield for Westralia, from 1912 to 1922, was a shade
over three tons per acre. The depressed and mis-
fortunate _lady from England said she didn’t think
Kendenup would produce enough potatoes Tor seed.
And perhaps she was right, though she couldn’t
stay to find out, having only 6s. left.

The Home that was Never Paid For.
An Every-day Tragedy, in Three Chapters.
GEORGE CROWLEY.
INTRODUCTORY.
HERE are the facts of a little life
tragedy, the truth of which I- can
vouch for, although for obvious
reasons I have suppressed the real names.
I have come across similar cases many
times during my 25 years’ occupancy of the
chair here, but this case presented special
interest, inasmuch as I knew both parties
since their boyhood and girlhood days.
I make no comment, other than this: —
Those responsible for the guidance and
the destinies of the City Mutual are not
out, and never have been out, during the
45 years of the Society’s existence, for a
large business, irrespective of cost, irrespec-
tive of stability, irrespective of the bene-
fits of the past traditions of the grand old
Institution of Life Assurance, which, honor-
ably conducted, is one of the wisest, noblest
and most beneficent provisions in this world
of ours.
CHAPTER I.
On the 14th May, 1920, Bill Squires
applied to the City Mutual for a loan of
£560 to build a home for his wife and two
kiddies in a Sydney suburb —the land had
been bought three years before —paid for out
of their savings.
We lent the money at 6 per cent, for a
term of three years, repayments £5 monthly
covering interest, and repayment of princi-
pal.
The three years went over. Squires had
a decent billet, as things go, not too well
off, but fairly comfortable. He was earn-
ing £5 a week, and the repayments were
regularly made. The loan was reduced in
three years to £400, or a little over. He
asked for a renewal of the loan, and was
happy over the matter. He had gone some
distance in making a home for his wife and
kiddies —there were three of them now. We
approved of the renewal, but in the course of
conversation I suggested that he would be
wise to take out a policy on his life for,
say, £500, costing £12 per year.
He was 30 years old, and that was the
premium for a £500 policy with a bonus of
£15 or £16 added to the policy each year.
Bill demurred. £12 was a lot of money,
he said, and he had to pinch a bit as it
was. Ho didn’t want any further expense
than could be avoided.
“What makes you call the premium on
your life policy an expense?” I asked. “You
have a Savings Bank account I see. [He
had his book with him.] How much do you
pay into the Bank every month?”
“Well, sometimes £3, sometimes £4,” was
Bill’s answer.
“Supposing we say £3,” I answered, “that
is £36 a year. Do you call that a saving
or an expense?”
“A saving, of course,” he promptly re-
plied.
“Well,” I answered, “a saving of £12 a
year, that is £1 a month for a life policy,
is a much better saving for you and your
family than £12 a year -with the Savings
Bank.”
“Can’t see it,” was his curt reply. “The
money is in the Bank if I ever want it.”
“So it is,” I told him, “but it will take
you nearly 12 years, at £36 a year, to
accumulate the amount you must raise to
release your house.
“Now, just suppose, it is only a supposi-
tion, of course, that you died at the end of
two or three years, how much money would
you have saved? A little over £100. How
far would that go to pay £400?”
“You are the head of a big Institution,
Mr. Crowley,” he said, “with plenty of
funds. Why are you so anxious to get me
to take out a policy with your Company?
You have thousands of members already;
what difference does one make to you?”
“Don’t be a fool,” I said gently. “So far
as the City Mutual is concerned, it is a mat-
ter of indifference to us whether you assure
with this Society or not. We have over
40,000 members, whose policies amount to
more than ten millions of money, and your
£500 is like a pint of water in the ocean.
We don’t want your policy to help us along,
I merely suggested that it would be a wise
saving for you and your family if you took
a policy out.
“There are plenty of other good Com-
panies, take a policy, if you like, with one
of them. That will show you whether my
advice is in the City Mutual interests or in
your own interests.
“There is the Colonial Mutual Office, a
sound old concern, the National Mutual,, a
Company with great resources, the Austra-
lian Mutual, which already has something
like two hundred millions of assurances, and
is always hungering for more as if it hadn’t
enough cash on hand to pay for to-morrow’s
breakfast.
“There are other good companies as well,
for that matter, but the only reason I sug-
gested the City Mutual was that, in the first
place you have interests here already, and,
in the second place, it is generally recog-
nised by everyone, with any knowledge of
life assurance, that the City Mutual pays
its policyholders far and away the best
returns by way of bonuses in the Empire.”
“Well, that is a fair enough way of put-
ting the matter,” said Squires, rubbing his
hand reflectively through his hair. “I’ll see
May about it.”
CHAPTER 11.
26/5/’23.
Mrs. Squires came in a day or two later,
a comely little woman of 2 or 3 and 30
summers. .
Her little son of 3 trotted by her side.
“About this insurance, Mr. Crowley,” she
opened, “Bill’s agreeable, but I ain’t. First
thing we carat afford it.”
“Cannot afford to save £1 a month?” I
said. “Bill tells me you are a thrifty little
woman, and you save £3 a month.”
“But you carnt call life assurance a sav-
ing,” was her reply. “It’s an expense.
And with the ’igh cost of livin’ our ex-
penses is terrible as it is.”
“No better saving in the world,” I told
her. “From the day the first premium is
paid you are £SOO a richer woman, and
Bill is £SOO a richer man. That £SOO is
not available at the moment, that is true,
but it is there when you want it most.”
“One may pay in £l2 a year for 20 years,
though,” said Mrs. Squires, “and then be
no better off at the end.”
“Ever so much better off,” I answered.
“That policy will then be worth over £BOO,
and all you have paid into the Society would
have been £240.
“Now, if you had put this money in the
Savings Bank all the time, and had never
drawn out a penny piece, and you wouldn’t
do that, you know [she smiled as if she
understood], you would have saved up at the
end of that time, with interest added each
year, exactly £371/12/7.”
“That is all right the way you put it,”
said Mrs. Squires (she was a shrewd little
woman in spite of her lack of University
education), “but supposin’ we wanted a
couple er hundred pounds at a pinch, we
could draw it out of the Savings Bank, but
we couldn’t touch the life assurance.”
“Wrong,” I replied. “Wrong, little
woman. You could borrow on that policy,
without one penny of expense for valua-
tion fees, without one shilling to pay in legal
fees, procuration expenses, or anything else,
and on the security of the policy alone, over
£2OO, and get the money in five minutes.
Even then you would have over £OOO left, as
against the Savings Bank’s £l7l/12/7.”
I intended to be exact with the little lady,
and so I quoted to the penny piece.
I wanted her as a sort of pioneer to dis-
pel the dark and dismal ignorance of ninety
per cent, of her class.
She hesitated for a moment.
In the meantime young Bill had conceived
a violent fancy for a large blue pencil which
lay on my table.
Ultimately we pacified him with one of
Macßobertson’s Old Gold Chocolates. They
would keep any child quiet.
She still hesitated.
I knew there was something on her mind,
some sense of impending danger.
She pursed her lips and was silent.
“What on earth can be in your mind?” I
asked, after waiting fully five minutes,
“when you tell me that it is you who object
to the Dolicy and to this saving when your
husband sees wisdom in it. For your own
sake, for the sake of the home you possess,
and for the sake of your three little chil-
dren, Bill should have a policy on his life.”
Then she spoke.
“Well, I have a sort of feeling that if
Bill insures himself he’ll die.”
“Nothing surer in the world,” I said
gently, “we have all got to die.”
“But he’ll die sooner,” she said.
“Well,” I answered, “I do not know if
you ever go to the races, but if Bill assures
his life, the Society is laying odds of £SOO
to £l2, over 40 to 1, that if they issue the
policy Bill will not die. Not for a long
time, at all events.”
“I don’t know anything about races,” said
Mrs. Squires, “I never go to them.”
“Good,” was my answer, “and it would be
a good thing for Australia if less women,
aye, and less men, too, went to the races.
But what I wish to drive home is this, that
a life policy is a sort of certificate of long
life.
“You don’t know anything of statistics,
of course, but the records for the past
hundred years show that out of a thousand
healthy people at Bill’s age, 984 would be
alive this time next year.
“And unless Bill has very hard luck, he
will be one of those 984.
“Now that ought to make you feel comfort-
able.”
“Well, you have got me thinkin’, any-
way,” said Mrs. Squires, as she rose to go,
“I will go into the matter with Bill to-
night.”
CHAPTER 111.
2/7/’23.
She is still “thinkin’,” poor little woman!
Early in June we got a recurrence of the
’flu, and then on the 27th —the wet, cold,
boisterous day on which the Manly boat had
a narrow escape from foundering whilst
crossing the Heads —Bill, who should not
have gone to work at all that day—he still
had a temperature —caught a chill and died
from pneumonia three days later.
“A good thing for the City Mutual,” did
you say?
It is not a good thing for the City
Mutual.
Life assurance is the City Mutual’s busi-
ness, and the only business for which the
City Mutual, and other reputable offices,
exist.
It is not a good thing for anyone.
It is a bad thing, and a sad thing, and if
I had my way I would make if compulsory
for every man with a family dependent on
him to effect a policy, for the protection of
his wife and his family, with some sound,
reputable Company.

“I have used Rexona Soap to my
entire satisfaction, and find it
delightfully refreshing and soothing
to the skin.”
Miss GWENDOLEN’*: LEAVIS,
1 Commercial Road.
North Hobart, Tas.
Girls! N
Imagine your
Complexion Clear,
Rosy and Velvety!
Are you sometimes discouraged and feel
that your skin is unattractive instead of
being clear, fresh and smooth? If so, look
to the soap you are using.
Many soaps are more injurious to the
skin than actual neglect, for they contain
harmful alkali, which tends to dry up
the skin and destroy its delicate texture.
Rexona Skin and Facial Soap is a speci-
ally prepared skin soap, entirely free from
harmful alkali. It will do more to im-
prove your skin than you ever thought a
soap could do, for it .is medicated on the
same principle as the famous Rexona
Ointment. Thus it is able to exert the
hygienic effects of Rexona upon the skin
with every cleansing operation.
Simply use Rexona Soap once or
twice a day, and see if it does not
relieve the clogged pores, reduce the
tendency to blotches, redness and
oiliness and leave the complexion
clear, rosy and velvety.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SINK down into the deep, sea-maid Mer-
lane,
Deep in the ocean twilight, virgin fair!
Pillow your head upon its tawny mane
Of waving, wondrous, phosphorescent hair.
The last, lone, laggard petrel leaves the wing,
Ihe tide is full, the sea is murmuring.
Sink deep through cool green waters to your
bower,
TV here earth-eluding sleep is surely found;
Sink to the moon-briglit sands, where petals
shower
From rosy coral blossoming around.
One eunuch-daring star of all the host
Steals from Night’s harem like a love-lorn
ghost.
In keen hypnotic sleep I hearkened long,
By water-doors of your obsidian cave,
To a new voice raised in an age-old song,
Where noon lay purple on the unctuous
wave;
And when the grey, elf-eyed, cliff-haunting
hag
Blew a weird conch from her nocturnal crag.
At last, new-bathed from sleep, a wonder-girl,
I found you standing waist-high in the
weeds,
With skin of satin, creamy like warm pearl,
And under-tint of rose, such rose as bleeds
In Syrian temples from the veins of doves
That, lifelong, murmured only of their loves.
Your forehead had the lustre of a star,
A restless beauty of innumerous rays;
And each brow was an amber scimitar,
Curved o’er the fiery-hearted opal gaze,
Lidded and lashed as fond and heavily
As blooms that are cup-bearers to the bee.
Sight vexed me that it would so far disclose
But sweet conjecture, and no more impart ;
Sight vexed me like a maid before a rose
Longing to make it bleed upon her heart—
Half risen from the foam to be so blind
To all the shadow and the pool confined.
All the fair gain and forced relinquishment
Had so my body and my mind bemused,
I moved to enter your chaste, spumy tent;
I saw your pulses, throbbing and confused,
Flutter like spirit-birds in a fain stir
To break their net’s enmeshing gossamer.
Day after day, still worshipping, I hied
With all the ardor of a heavenly fool,
Punctual upon the inflow of the tide
That bore my love unto the trysting pool
From some unfathomed and mysterious grot
Of ocean coral or of meadowplot.
Day after day. . . .till at the first caress
Wonder, then dread, o’ercame and quenched
desire.
I saw and touched your scaly underdress.
Cold as a whelping seal fresh from the dire
Auroral floe —curved and encased within
A silvery armor trimmed with tail and fin.
Sink down. Merlane! Would I might sink
with you
To spring and summertime and harvest
home,
Upon mossed meadows where pearls hang
for dew,
And Tyrian curtains, with the meerschaum-
foam
Rolled back on nuptial beds, where never we
May wed, co-mingled, the marauding sea!
Daughter of some bronzed pirate, who, too
soon
Banished through liquid summer to his
death,
Espoused your mother of the tide and moon,
Begetting with a clutch upon his breath,
I may not wed you with a lust as bold
As his loud rapes and frays and forays old.
Ewn in the mad, libidinous final throe.
Down there among the wet, wild hyacinths
Clinging to reefs that jag the snarling flow
Above _ the serpent-stones of polished
plinths,
™® n ?trous tumult met the maid and man,
Rolled in eyed spawn of the Leviathan.
Y ho shall, upon a charger, bring me peace.
Aow that the wanton from my couch is
sped ?
an anodyne for love’s release?
0 dear Salome! dance me down that
head—
Grief s from his pillared neck, in sweet
mishap,
And nurse it, reeking, in your harlot lap.
In sullen, moody pride,that I abhor
He haunts the ghostly casement of the
mind.
As though I were his damned, inheritor,
Pollened by him upon a careless wind —
A tree that bears no fruit, yet still must grow
A clammy fungus for rare mistletoe.
™ u . ld iave l° ve( l .you. Rather even yet
This heated passion, suddenly grown cold,
Lives on, not with indifferent regret;
But ah. Merlane, the sea is wise and old
Co guard her courts from new adulterous lies
And keep them pure as your translucent
eyes!
Ilow must I mourn lost beauty of the south
And low Atlantean courts the richer grown
By your wet face and small pomegranate
mouth
And untressed hair, by vagrant currents
blown
Back from your brows of delicate marbled
white
Above your eyes’ swift javelins of light!
Sink deep, sink deep, where never glimmering
wraith
Or chill regret may haunt you with its
pain!
Bve of the Waters, may God ward off scaitli
£ rom you! You could not know, proud
t finned Merlane,
How close love drew to beauty at a glance
In that wide ocean of our severance.
And there in coral convents of the seas
With sapphire curtains hung, and win-
, dowed wide
To tossing kelp-fields and anemones,
Blown by cool zephyrs of the tropic tide,
forget how through vain dreams of land
and sea,
The serpent fangs still pierce Eurydiee ’
MAOBILAND.
DARIUS.
The Unblemished Impression.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
could have been more fan-
tastic than the awakening of Cap-
tain Albrecht’s love. He hadn’t
even set eyes upon the object of it. He fell
in love —into a passion of love—with a mere
sound: a voice, coming from somewdiere in
the oppressive, clammy darkness, saying
quietly “I refuse!’-’
His mind was not attuned at the time to
passion : his thoughts had been centred with
professional exclusiveness upon the storm
which he knew was coming. He had been
dozing in his hammock slung between the
awning stanchions of the poop-deck. The
voice had appeared to come from the dark-
ness beyond the rail, from the air, well above
the level of the water, and yet from some en-
closed space—as from a ship’s cabin, for
instance.
And there was absolutely nothing to be
seen.
He strained his eyes, but the darkness was
impenetrable even to his love-quickened
senses. He concentrated desperately on his
task. The safety of the ship—his beloved
little Prali—was forgotten. He simply
noted automatically, from the faint whisper
of the invisible water, and the feel of the
deck beneath his feet, “We’re swinging to
the flood,” and thought no more about it.
A second exclamation, “No ! No ! No !
Keep away from me!” fixed the location of
the voice beyond dispute.
It brought his thoughts (still wholly occu-
pied with love) back to the sea and the
weather. Not that he was in any way con-
cerned. The fiercest storm, arising at that
moment, Would have been no more than an
annoying distraction —an interruption to his
passionate desire.
He thought, “We shall foul each other,”
calmly, as though he ’ really rather wanted
his ship to drift foul of the towering shape
which he could now vaguely sense through
perhaps 20 yards of velvety blackness.
She had lain abeam of the Prali all the
previous day, this shape; and she was really
nothing more mysterious than a big West
Indian banana-carrier, the Toloa, come in
for water and a little cargo shortly after
daybreak.
Albrecht, on deck that morning when the
roar of her anchor-cable had broken the still-
ness, had remarked upon her closeness: “If
we swing inways to the tide slie’ll foul us,
I think.” And Derwent, the engineer, had re-
plied : “Would you like steam on the capstan
—to shorten in—just in case?” Such a pre-
caution would have been seamanly, perhaps;
but it wasn’t one which the Prah was in
any way obliged to take. If they fouled the
fault would lie with the Toloa. Albrecht had
decided. “No! We’ll be away to-morrow.
It’s not likely to happen in that time. Don’t
bother.” And now, in the dead of night,
with no steam at all in the Prah to drag her
out of harm’s way, this great fruit-boat was
sidling stealthily across the slack water to-
wards her; intent, apparently, upon carry-
ing away the, sea-boat on the starboard-after
davits or buckling her frail counter. And
Albrecht, master and owner, welcomed the
approach, because it brought that love-com-
pelling voice nearer to him.
Such is the glory of certain brief moments
in life.
The high stern of the fruit-boat was so
close now that Albrecht could actually hear
the swish of tiny wavelets—sole disturbance
of the slowly-moving ships—slapping gently
against her great rudder. Above the in-
definite blackness of her hull loomed the
bulk of something a shade lighter—the white
superstructure of her poop. The poop-deck
itself, terminated by the thread of the wliite-
painted ensign-staff, was a clear four feet
above Captain Albrecht’s head—almost
directly above him now. Below the poop-
deck, on a level with his head, winked a
row of solemn, enormous eyes—polished brass
flanges of portholes.
Beyond the murmurous lap of water the
approach of the two ships was made in
ghostly silence; slowly, yet with that stolid
deliberation of massive bodies which gives
the impression of swiftness. The whole affair
at a normal moment would have been fraught
with disastrous possibilities for the captain
of the. Prah. There would be damage and
confusion. His own pride would be hurt
because this monster would mishandle his
little craft, jostling her roughly out of the
way, ruining paint-work, smashing stan-
chions and davits and guard-rails, buckling
plates perhaps in her ruthless hurry to swing
her nose to the flood-tide.
But he didn’t think of this. He . stood
breathless for possibly a couple of minutes.
Presently, from one of the darkened port-
holes the blinding glare of an electric light
flashed full into his face.
Someone inside a lighted cabin had
wrenched the deadlight offhand had thrown
open the scuttle —to get fresh air, presum-
ably ; for, framed by the new-formed circle
of bright light, was the face of a woman—
the owner of the voice, without doubt —draw-
ing in great mouthfuls of air from the steamy
night.
The bright light behind her and the im-
penetrable darkness outside made her fea-
tures barely distinguishable. Yet Captain
Albrecht recognised her adorable beauty. Her
hair formed a halo of glory about her. Her
eyes gazed steadily into the blackness—right
into his face, it seemed.
He wondered how he could have heard that
entrancing voice of hers through the thick-
ness of the glass scuttle and the tightly-
fitting deadlight. Piecing tiny, elemental de-
ductions together, he decided that she had
been elsewhere when she had spoken, and
had retreated (“No! No! No! Keep away
from me!”) before some terrible danger into
the lighted cabin —probably a disused one,
because of the deadlight being over the port.
It was perfectly easy to imagine her lying
in her bunk, peacefully asleep, further for-
ward in the ship. A man—a little, thin-
lipped rat of a fellow, Albrecht conjectured
—had stolen softly into her cabin and had
evoked the protest that lie had heard across
the water. She had probably jumped up,
just as she was, and had run aft for safety.
All this guessing was unconscious—auto-
matic—-on the part of the captain of the
Prah. He was bereft of his senses, capable
only of trying to illuminate the darkness in

Severe Eczema Defies
Treatment by Specialists.
Speedily Banished by Zam-Buk.
Mr. J. P. Hannon, of 2 Hopetoun Street, New-
town, N.S.W., writes: —“I was a member of the
A.1.P., and whilst in Prance I Suffered from a
severe outbreak of Eczema on my legs. I was
treated by several skin specialists* in Prance and
in England, but in spite of all kinds of treatment
the Eczema grew worse and I Hound no relief
whatever. I was beginning to despair of ever
getting right again when I thougltt of Zam-Buk,
and after purchasing a box I was agreeably sur-
prised to find that even the first application afforded
some relief. 1 continued the regular dressings
with Zam-Buk, and 1 am glad to say that within a
week the fiery irritation had disappeared and the
skin healed completely.
“It is five years since Zam-Buk cured me of
this distressing complaint, and siiufe that time I
have not had the slightest return <of the trouble.
I can gratefully testify to the healing ptower of your
wonderful remedy, and in future will never be
without it.”

order to make plain the woman’s features,
by force of will.
She must have become aware then of his
presence, standing beneath the shadowy poop-
deck awning, hardly six feet away from her
—a big. blurred form dominated by a pair
of burning eyes.
The sheer force of his yearning for her
had, perhaps, some directing influence.
She started —an imperceptible movement—
and drew in a deep, sibilant breath.
Albrecht, in a perfect fever of excitement,
murmured into the deathly silence: “It’s all
right! He shan’t hurt you! I will save
you!”
The declaration of protection was really
rather absurd, considering that they were in
different ships—-separated for all their near-
ness by a world. Yet it had its uses, appa-
rently. It returned her attention to her dan-
ger—to the loathsome prowler from whom
she had fled into the lighted cabin. None
too soon. Behind her a door-latcli clicked
neatly. Followed the sound of a boot scrap-
ing over the combing of a doorway.
A suave voice murmured : “Ah, there you
are. my beauty! I thought I should find you
in here!”
The woman turned away from the scuttle
slowly, as if reluctantly, to face this invis-
ible man; and in turning she presented to
the watcher a view of her face from every
angle.
It was no more than he had expected. Her
beauty did not surprise or agitate him ; for
he was already agitated to the utmost limits
of his being in the expectation of magnifi-
cent perfection. His imagination had already
pictured her, just as God may possibly have
pictured the woman he intended to make for
earth’s first mistress.
She stood rigid on one side of the port-
hole. Albrecht could see just one shoulder,
draped with a ribbon of filmy white stuff; a
bare white shoulder-blade like a piece of
rippling satin ; the column of her neck; the
tawny glory of her hair. Beyond her in the
cabin was visible the head of a red, plush-
covered settee, and the gleam of a lot of
brass and white enamel. The man, moving
about somewhere stealthily, was still in-
visible.
Suddenly the woman spoke. “Not a step
nearer!” And Albrecht thrilled again at
the sound of her voice, low and musical even
in the crisis of her danger.
“My dear, you shan’t escape me—this
time!” replied the invisible man.
The woman moved slightly and disappeared
from view. Then she was heard to cry
out: “Oh, you beast! You beast! You
beast!”
The man spoke sullenly. “Not so much
noise, you little spitfire! You’ll wake the
whole ship !”
There was no answer; but in the
quiet somebody could be heard snatching
up something that rattled metallically.
“Put that down !” cried the man sharply.
Bare feet pattered quickly upon the corti-
cine flooring, followed by the larger sound of
booted feet running.
All this time the ships were drifting.
By stretching out his hands Albrecht was
able to grasp the brass flange of the port-
hole and lean across the water upon the
support it gave him. His scope of vision
was now much wider. He could see nearly
the whole of the interior of the cabin.
He recognised it at once as a sick-bay,
a ship’s hospital. There were two swinging
cots, the settee, and a big glass-topped table
in the centre. Round this the man —small,
dark, cadaverous, even as Albrecht had
conjectured—was chasing the woman, wiio
was struggling, as she ran, to open a polished
steel box, such as surgeons use to hold
their instruments.
It opened very suddenly. She snatched
at something inside it and then let box
aud all its remaining contents fall crash-
ing to the floor in a cascade Of glittering
steel.
“Put that down, and stop your fooling!’’
hissed the man, between labored breatns.
“D'you think 1 care for what you can do
with that silly little bodkin?”
Albrecht, drawing himself up, preparatory
to shouting “Stop” at the top of his lungs,
was himself stopped in his project by tne
sound of somebody sitting down heavily
upon the cabin floor. A second after, the
door opened. A flicker of white of the
woman’s nightdress in the blackness of the
doorway—the snap of descending darkness
as she switched off the light—and she was
gone. Somewhere in the inky darkness,
close to the red plush settee, the man was
breathing thickly.
Something above the captain of the Prah
started to crack and groan and splinter. It
was the Prah’s seaboat, still out-turned upon
her davits, taking the first impact of the big
freighter’s counter. Nothing else, in the
way of sea-sounds, was audible. Even the
slight lapping of water about the ships had
died away.
The night, even blacker than before,
seemed to be holding its breath. The heat
of it was stifling, like that of some gigantic
living animal dose by.
He looked up, not at the splintering sea-
boat, but because he sensed that the woman
had come on to the poop-deck of the Toloa,
and was leaning over the rail. She saw his
upturned face.
“What shall I do?” she whispered. “Can
you hear me? Tell me what I ought to do.”
“Will you trust me?” He could hardly
force himself to utter the question; because
he would take no denial of trust from this
woman.
She whispered again : “Yes ! I’ll trust you.”
“Then jump! Climb over the rail, and
jump ! I’ll catch you !”
Standing upon her precarious ledge out-
side the bulwark, she hesitated.
“No! I mustn't! That man.... 1 think
I’ve killed him!”
“Oh, never mind about him! You had
to—in self-defence!”
“No ! No ! You don’t understand ! I’m
wicked ! Oh, I’m bad !”
Albrecht protested, in a quivering voice:
“My heart! My heart! Don’t say such
things! You’re so perfect, my dear”....
Above him the splintering timbers of the
sea-boat cried out unheeded. The night
crouched, ready to spring—a smooth black
beast of foetid breath.
The girl, twisting her nightdress about
her knees, breathed sadly: “I couldn’t! No!
I must stay up here —away from, you. iou
would be disillusioned, if you knew me
I’m wicked”.... „ . _ ,
Forward, from the bridge of the Toloa,
somebody barked sharply: “Ahoy ! V\ hat
the Hell ship is that lying alongside my
quarter? Lie off!” And then again:
“Quartermaster! Quartermaster! Nip alt
with fenders! Lively, now! There s that
damned little packet swung foul of us;
“Do vou hear that? said Albrecht.
“They’ll discover you! Jump now, and 1 11
catch you ! You’ll be safe in my ship, they
shan’t touch you. I want you, dearest!
She whispered. “Yes! All right. 11l
jump! But I’m so wicked! And like this,
too ! You’ll be disgusted witli me”
At that very moment the night sprang up
at them. A sharply intaken breath that
drained every particle of air from the black-
ness about them, making the heart miss a
beat; a sickening pause; then it leapt, a
living thing, preceded by a line of ghostly
froth upon the surface of the oily water.
The girl hesitated, terrified. The single
flash of lightning which announced the
arrival of the tornado revealed her standing
erect, with one hand at her throat, literally
flattened against the rail of the Toloa by
the force of the wind, her filmy nightdress
spread upon the bulwark like a cloud.
The ships took the impact of the wind
each after its own fashion. The Prah, heavy-
laden, shuddered and settled her little
shoulders to resist it. The big banana-boat,
with practically empty holds, began at once
to reel away from its force. The two ships
fell apart.
Albrecht saw the danger. He roared:
“Jump ! Throw yourself off! Now, at once,
before it’s too late!”
The rain was upon them then. It fell
solidly, a deluge, so that in a second the
little poop-deck awning of the Prah was
gushing cascades of water upon Albrecht’s
shoulders.
The hiss of it drowned any sound the girl
may have uttered. She must have heard
Albrecht’s roar, though, because she imme-
diately cast herself off her ledge towards
the man she trusted.
But she was too late. Already the ships
were eight or ten feet apart. The sea-boat,
released from the grinding of the big ship’s
counter, hung drunkenly, nose downwards,
from the slips of the after davit. Albrecht,
leaning far out over the seething water,
caught, in his free hand, nothing more than a
strip of silk from the girl’s nightgown. In
the confusion of rain and wind and sea be-
neath him, he could not even distinguish the
splash she made as she fell.
He flung himself over the side after her,
the piece of silk still grasped in his fingers.
By the time he found her the squall had
blown itself out. The hissing rain had flat-
tened the surface of the water to a glassy
smoothness once more. The ships, now
parted by more than a cable’s length, lay
calmly parallel, their prows pointing stead-
fastly oceanwards.
Already the flood-tide was beginning to set
strongly. Perhaps 20 minutes had elapsed.
He reached his ship with his burden. The
starboard gangway was down, and he man-
aged to get the girl laid upon the lower plat-
form before heaving himself wearily out of
the w r ater.
The white engineer, Derwent, would have
picked her up; but he waved him aside and
carried her on deck himself. Across the
water lights were streaming from every part
of the fruit-boat. People were shouting, call-
ing a woman’s name repeatedly, giving
orders.
He took her below, and laid her in the
cot in his own cabin. Then he went to his
chest-of-drawers, took out a clean towel and
tiptoed back to her.
“I have had you in my arms an eternity,”
he said. “I’m not ungrateful, my dear! I
never hoped to be so happy in all my life!
I didn’t believe it could be possible!”
He dried her dead-white skin very ten-
derly. Then he put his arms under her shoul-
ders and kissed her cold lips.
Derwent, white-faced, met him at the head
of the companion-way.
“Can’t you get any life into her at all V
he asked.
“No,” said Albrecht. “Why?”
“Why? Well! Good God! Dead, then''
This is very terrible, sir!”
“No,” said Albrecht again. “Not terrible.
Derwent.”
He went over to the ship’s side where his
hammock was still slung, and leant over the
rail —just as he had done before, ages ago.
The rain was over. The awning still
dripped ; but overhead the stars were begin-
ning to shine through the wrack. The air
had the pleasant freshness of dawn in it, and
a clean salt breeze blew into his nostrils a
whiff of smoke from the Toloa’s funnel.
A steam capstan began to clank.
“They’re shortening in,” said Derwent.
“They’ll sail at daybreak.”
“Good,” said Albrecht. “Then you can
have steam for sea as soon as you can raise it."
“Aye, aye, sir! Will you signal the Toloa
—er—about the—er—corpse, sir?”
“No! I shall bury her at sea myself—
this afternoon. Tell the carpenter to have
that boat swung in and repaired.”
“Aye, aye, sir! I beg pardon—but I’m
very sorry—if you’re cut up—about—the
lady, sir!”
“I’m not,” said Albrecht. “Go below now
and do as I tell you.”
The young engineer went below to his
stokehold.
At dawn the Toloa proceeded to sea. At
five bells in the forenoon watch the little
Prah weighed and followed her. At three in
the afternoon Captain Albrecht buried the
woman Jte had loved.
DerwXjfc kept his own council, but he sus-
pected that under his sternly calm demeanor
Albrecht was hiding a terrible grief.
He was wrong.
The other’s moment had come—suddenly—
unannounced. He had lived it—and it was
gone.
And of it there remained in him an impres-
sion, not of tragedy or death or anything
really, strictly personal, but of a living,
passionate, triumphant moment, unhampered
by conditions of time or reason —a moment
snatched from Heaven; swift; complete;
satisfying.
It was better so.
