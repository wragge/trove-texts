THE MOUTH THE GATEWAY for DISEASE.
Scientists have proved conclusively that no fewer
than 38 different infections may be traced to the
human mouth as a starting fwint. The mouth thus
being the gateway for the entrance of disease, it
is here that precautions are most necessary.

all organisms which give rise to infectious diseases,
they keep the mouth in a sweet, healthy condition.

act as a bactericide in the 'mouth. This result is
likely to be gained, tor in the experiments tried

“The Butcher Shop”
There is in Maoriland a Board of Cen-
sors that plays strange pranks with litera-
ture. The authorities in the Dominion have
a peculiar, almost paternal, regard for the
morals of the book-reading public. I once
heard of a Customs official in ’Wellington
who made searching inquiry into the nature
of a book on dietetics called “Girth Con-
trol,” and of another who, with a knowing
look, demanded the production by an amazed
bookseller of “What Every Woman Knows” !
The latest work to code under the pater-
nal eye is The Butcher Shop, a Maoriland
novel by a Maoriland writer, jean Devanny.
It is to be burned by the public executioner,
or shot at dawn, or something of the kind.
The novel is reminiscent, rather, of a dis-
ordered nightmare following a boarding-house
supper of prawns; but it has its moments
for all that. Margaret, a domestic servant
on a M.E. sheep-station, captures the youth-
fill fancy of the boss, becomes Mrs. Barry
Messenger and bears her good man several
children. In the temporary absence of her
husband, the advent of a station-manager,
Glengarry, makes a new chapter in Mar-
garet’s placid existence. There is a brief
liaison, but Glengarry, on Messenger’s re-
turn, is, as most decent men are in similar
circumstances, rather ashamed of the busi-
ness, Not so Margaret, who talks loftily
about love —in letters of gold—and main-
tains that, although she must, as a good wife,
refuse to desert her husband and children,
she is entitled, as a good wife and by some
elastic code of morality, to eschew mono-
gamy. The arrival of Miette, Messenger’s
cousin, adds a complication. Miette is a
common little vamp with a promiscuous sex-
challenge. She finally conducts a sordid love
affair with a Maori who has-been persona
grata- at the Messenger household for many
years. Margaret is horrified; her home is
sullied by this unhallowed love, and she pro-
ceeds, without further ado, to raise Cain.
This is where Miss Devanny commences
to wallow in what our American neighbors
term “psych.-stuff.” But, as a reviewer in
the OnsEKVER points out, she has yet to learn
that “psychology and pathology differ in
more than a few letters of the alphabet.”
Subscribing, possibly, to Voltaire’s theory
that the superfluous is a very necessary
thing, Miss Devanny throws in, as extra
weight, a re-hash of a much-quoted ML.
crime, in which a laborer in delirium
tremens murdered, by request, his life-long
pal, the _ corpse-designate being also far
advanced in the stage of seeing puce tuataras,
the M.L. variant of pink lizards. On top of
that she supplies some revolting details of
the torture of a dog—so that Messenger may
show himself as a chivalrous defender of
dumb animals—and unsavory particulars of
the castration of sheep. By way of a final
bonne-louche there is the murder of Mar-
garet’s lover—by Margaret, and with a
razor, too.
The book is crude enough, Heaven knows,
but behind it all there is, for those who
choose to look for it, sincerity and a certain
grim strength. The action of the Board of
Censors, at all events, is quite unwarranted.
Intrigues of the kind described in “The
Butcher Shop” are served to us, world with-
out end, on the films, at the theatres, in the
newspapers _ and in most modern novels.
Shane Leslie’s “The Cantab,” which is in
circulation in the Dominion, has passages
(written, it is true, with polished phrases
and with due regard for the mot juste ) that
are, if anything, franker than Miss Devanny’s
most startling efforts. The same remarks
apply to Stephen McKenna’s “The Oldest
God.” And certainly no character in “The
Butcher Shop” goes to the length of having
special jewellery manufactured pour le nom
onl (one is modestly compelled to express
it fa- French)> as does the amorous Maudie
I*l The Cantab.” No, if “The Butcher
Shop had been set in Tunis or Tangiers,
Texas or Trouville instead of Taihape—a
dire place for the Rose of Romance to bloom !
the board would have blinked benignly
and murmured “Pass, friend !”
Miss Jane Mander, the M.L. writer whose
first novel produced, in its day, something
of a sensation, wrote me from London the
other day : “I cannot help wondering what
those gentle souls who have been horrified by
my books are going to say to their latest
author. They are not going to be allowed
to say, apparently. But Miss Devanny’s
publishers, Duckworth, will probably issue
two extra editions, or three, on the strength
of it all.

Why Authors Leave Home
As president of the Authors 7 Section of
the A.J.A., I was lately asked by Mr. Prat-
ten to present a concrete case for reference
to the Tariff Board; and with my colleagues
I have been preparing it. I think it will at
least take some answering.
In the past the Australian waiter and
artist have had to work for "whatever poor
pay they could get and wait for fame and
reward. What they want now, and are
determined to have, is a decent return, so
that they can keep themselves and their
families in comfort. So far, with the exeep-
lion of a few fortunate top-nptehers. their
return has been wretched owing principally
10 , . mass of literature, true and alleged
whien is dumped here and practically given
away, in some eases on the strength of
advertisements. The chief - offender in this
T% t! A e S A TUR -'i AY Evening Post, of the
Li.fe.A. Its gift price gets a circulation of
so many millions per week, the circulation
gets advertisers, and the advertisers pay for
the literary matter and leave a big profit
Iho magazine or newspaper published here
has to pay high wages to its workmen • hi<di
prices for its machinery; high prices for its
liaper. In return its circulation is practi
cally limited to the Commonwealth with its
paltry population of 6,000,000. How. then
under the present competition with the im-
ported stuff, turned out by mass production
smd often practically given away on its
advertisements, can the Australian'paper or
magazine pay its writers and artists anv-
l.ung approaching the foreign paper’s rates?
So long as this dumped foreign matter is per-
mitted to come in scathiess, the Australian
writer and artist must either starve in his
own country or leave it for a better one.
Ajistralian-born, I have been writing over
25 years in Australia. Financially, I would
have done very much better if I had taken
up bricklaying. Fortunately, I have not
depended on it.
Mow with regard to Australian writers
benefiting their country by creating an Aus-
tralian sentiment. The brutal fact is that
the Australian community won’t pay for it
so long as they can get the cheap imported
stuff, any more than they will pay a fair
price for a good Australian tool if they can
get a cheap foreign one. By shutting out
this dumped foreign matter, or, at least,
causing. it. to be sold at a price relative to
the Australian cost of production, work for
Australian printers, block-makers, etc., will
be largely increased, giving employment to
many more of our own men ; and plenty of
local money would be available for maga-
zines and newspapers specialising in lines
which have little or no representation at
present. This last fact should be specially
interesting to Australian manufacturers, be-
cause these dumped magazines advertise
foreign goods so lavishly that, so far as pub-
licity goes, his goods are at a heavy dis-
advantage alongside them in the Australian
market.
All that the Australian writer and artist
want is a fair deal. They are quite prepared
to let their work find its proper level in com-
petition with the imported work under
similar conditions; but they cannot turn out
their best work here when the competition of
dumped foreign stuff keeps their pay down
to starvation level.
ROBERT KALESKI.
Kathleen Watson: An Appreciation
By the death of Mrs. William Bearden,
better known by her pen-name of Kathleen
Watson, Australia loses a writer who, though
not native-born, knew and loved this country
well. The daughter of a Welsh parson,
most of her early days were spent in a small
village in Wales, but frequent visits to Paris
with her father, a witty and cultured man,
tremendously influenced her outlook on life.
In Wales she shared some of her studies
with the Cornwallis-West sisters, both
afterwards so notorious in the social life
of Germany and of England. Perhaps
of the three hers was the happiest
destiny. She came to Australia as a young
woman, and married an Australian interested
in timber. It was her familiarity with the
big forests which gave her an insight into
the splendor and majesty of the bush, an
enthusiasm which she often expressed,
though admitting that the spell and beauty
of our own forest-country had never yet been
adequately described in prose, poetry or
picture.
Of Adelaide, where she had her first Aus-
tralian home and where her two children
were born, she treasured many happy
memories. Melbourne, too, she liked greatly,
its briskness and energy according well with
her own nature. For many years before her
death, however, she had lived in Brisbane,
and, though she never complained, I know she
felt that the conditions were Sometimes
hard to contend with. She loved her own
home, with its .deep verandahs and tropic
garden, and hers was such a sunny nature
that only now and then, by some wistful
little half-jesting remark, one knew she was
not always, quite in the picture. “In the
midst of life we are in—Brisbane!” she once
wrote me. Of her illness she never spoke at
all. Only once, a few months ago, she
wrote: “I am now compelled to lead a very
quiet life, or else I should' have to lead a
much quieter!” Outspoken and frank to a
degree, she sometimes scandalised her more
conventional neighbors. The discarding of
shoes and stockings in the house and the
ract that once she attended the races in a
straw boater and sandshoes were facts which
were remarked where her wonderfully bril-
liant and witty sayings passed over the heads
of her neighbors. Hers was such a rare,
big-souled nature that she could not even
perceive pettiness or jealousy.
« Kathleen Watson’s best-known book,
Bite s Litanies,” is full of an underlying
sadness which few suspected in one of her
nigh spirits. It was a great disappointment
to her that her last book, “Henriette Says,”
met with so little appreciation from the read-
mg public. Australian in theme, it dealt
with the experiences of a French war-bride
ii] tlie bush surroundings of her new home.
Whenever I found anyone who had read
and appreciated the poetic little work I per-
suaded her to write, there and Ihen, and tell
of the enjoyment. These little notes of
enthusiasm for her neglected little literary
offspring were, I am gjad to remember, ii
real solace. She was a. most devoted and
understanding mother to her grown-up son
and daughter, and lived in their joys and
sorrows, as only a deeply sympathetic nature
can. She was not one of those who made
troops of friends”—.who worth while ever
d0 n £ i F er intimates know that the
ache of her loss is one which the passing
years will not ever altogether still.

DAVID JONES’
he is getting the minimum wage, can find
plenty of girls more than ready to get out of
the factory, the shop or the home. But xs
this difference of age of very great conse-
quence? Few women of any class care to
wait beyond the ages between 26 and 30
before marrying, and few who seek even pro-
fessional men have to do so. They find
husbands a few years their senior—in the
early thirties, say. So that most women,
even of the “educated” classes, marry be-
tween the ages of 23 and 27. If working
girls marry at 19 or 20 there is only a differ-
ence of eight years at worst. It is simply
dishonest of “R.S.” to make unfair use of
this difference by suggesting that “through
sheer force of this circumstance” the wife-
at-27 “cannot” have as many children as the
wife-at-20. Of course, in one sense it is
true —the wife-at-20 could have 15 children
if she resembled her grandmother; and if the
educated woman resembled hers she has the
tinn' and health to give birth to, say, only
10. In that sense the “sheer force of this
circumstance” of late marriage might be said
to affect the fertility of the two mothers. But
even the working-class, mother, at whatever
age she has married, is something of a curi-
osity in Australia to-day if she has seven
children.
“R.S.” attempts to meet this by suggest-
ing that they “do not indiscriminately beget
children without consideration of the future,
and of the advantages' and disadvantages,
financial and otherwise, under which they
will labor.” In short, “R.S.” sees an almost
universal practice of “birth control” amongst
the members of the educated classes, and an
almost complete absence of it amdng “lower”
classes. But this won’t do at all. Apart
from the fact that attempted contraception
is highly uncertain in its effects, even under
the best circumstances (as even Marie
Stopcs admits in her very restrained and
judicial “Contraception”)—apart from this
fact, we are asked to believe that whole
classes of women are sufficiently clear-
sighted, practical, unromantic and sexually
informed as to be able to use, from the very
marriage day, and with success, a highly
delicate technique, and that the women of
the lower classes have not sufficient egotism
and intelligence to relieve themselves of the
heavy burden of excessive child-bearing. Nor
can “R.S.” get out of it by suggesting that
sexual “improvidence” is the prerogative of
the “mental deficients” without providing a
much more plausible proof than any I have
seen that mental deficients are confined to
the poorer classes. No. It is impossible,
to attribute the smaller families of the edu-
cated classes either to “economic” causes
which demand later marriages, or to wide-
spread knowledge and effective use of diffi-
cult and faulty technical practices.
Nor are small families confined to the
“educated” ; they are the mark of the higher
social classes as a whole, and no one but
a fool, ignorant of either, would maintain
that a member of the moneyed classes (which
are our “upper”) is better educated, in any
comprehensible sense, than the average work-
man —in Australia, at any rate. In short,
both Henry Fletcher and “R.S.” have to
face the much bigger fact of the thinning of
the family as the social ladder is scaled.
The most plausible explanation that I
have seen was put forward by Charles
Edward Pell in “The Law of Births and
Deaths,” which attracted a good deal of
attention on its publication, and is getting
more and more from sociologists aq,d social
students in general. _ ,
Pell maintains, to put it briefly, that fer-
tility decreases with the rise in the standard
of living—with the command of comfort, of
superior food and of leisure, and the free-
dom from rigorous physical work. He sug-
gests that arduous lives mean fertility and
easy lives mean a tendency towards relative
sterility. He brings evidence in support of
his theory from all forms of life; from
plants, from insects, from the lower and the
higher animals and from man. He offers
very plausible explanations of the “rise”
and “fall” of peoples, the “decline” of em-
pires, and the emergence and disappearance
of social classes in ancient and modern times.
His contentious are heavily documented, and
lie has drawn upon a vast store of information
and statistics to back up his generalisation.
He shows, for instance, how his theory ex-
plains the disappearance of many noble fami-
lies through sheer absence of heirs (and
these are families in which one or two male
children are of supreme importance to the
parents, thus precluding any question of
“birth control”) ; he notes that the families
of, for instance, members of societies 1 opposed
to birth control are no larger than those of
convinced and professing “birth-controllers” ;
he manages to explain convincingly an enor-
mous number of conflicting and disconcert-
ing social facts.
In this connection it is interesting to
observe the evidence afforded by Roman
Catholics. Their religion expressly forbids
the use of contraceptives, and yet the same
phenomenon is observed among Catholics as
among non-Catholics; the higher we go in
the social scale, the greater degree of com-
fort and security enjoyed by successive social
classes, the smaller become the families.
So far, no theory has been advanced which
fits so many facts, or explains them so well.
It is not “education” that is the enemy of
fertility; it is “civilisation.” Perhaps, some
day, the full significance and importance of
this will he realised —it will be realised that
we shall achieve quality instead of quan-
tity in human material only by improving
the general level of comfort. Otherwise the
“superior” types will be a mere froth exist-
ing precariously on the surface of a vast
inferior proliferating mass.
Warren Graves.
John Donne
John Donne is surely the most neglected
figure of his calibre in the whole range of
English literature. His works are, indeed,
available' in some, though by no means all,
public libraries. In the shops, both new and
second-hand, his name is practically un-
known. For the last five years or more
I have made it a matter of curiosity to
inquire for his poems in every bookshop I
entered; and though the list includes the
celebrated seven second-hand establishments
in Charing Cross-road, besides many in
Edinburgh— surely the home of books —in no
one instance has my search been rewarded.
Yet this is the man of whom Ben .Tonson
said he esteemed him “the first poet in the
world for some things.” . .
Of the more intangible, intimate cliaractcr-
istics of Donne’s work no description could
even be attempted in anything short ot a
full-sized memoir. Such are his pessimism
that peculiar product of the Renaissance
return to classicism —his sensuousness, his
passion, his transcendentalism, his bizarre
wit, his naturalism, his metaphysical quamt-
ness, his mystic voyages to strange frontier
regions, uttermost isles where sensuality,
nliilosophy and devotion meet, or where
separately dwelling they rejoice or, mourn
over the conquests of ea*h other. ' )m
aspect of his remarkable poetry, however,
lends itself well to occasional comment, inis
is his genius as a shaper of unforgettable
phrases. Phrases of exquisite lilt, ot simple,
often naive, beauty, of startling precision,
of incandescent wit and passion—lns works
are starred with them as a November held
with daisies. Meandering through an un-
likely theme, or making your way through
an occasional arid passage, you come all at
once upon a little knot-garden of quaint
turns of thought, Or “feel the dewy drops
come cool and suddenly against the face
from an unexpected bower of delicate fancy.
None but an essentially poetical imagination
could be capable of a single touch of the
magic of words, the authentic, sheer magic,
of which Donne’s work affords scores of
instances. Without indulging in an excess
of enthusiasm, such as might legitimately
be engendered of the attractive subject, it
may be simply and soberly said that Donne
at his best is not only unsurpassed, but, in
his own strange, .esoteric realm, unsurpass-
abjt" seems, to those who know and love him,
the most natural thing in the world that
Donne should be largely preoccupied with
the two great themes of love and death. In
the three-score songs and sonnets alone
beside which there are the epithalamia and
numerous references in other poems to be
considered— the former gives occasion for such
splendid touches as these: “I wonder, by my
troth, what thou and I did till we loved i ;
love “makes one little room an everywhere :
“Till age snow white hairs on thee ’; “And
lovers’ hours be full eternity” ; “Who prince
enough in ofic another be’ ; “Who is so safe
as we? where none can do Treason to _us
except one of us two” ; “I long to talk with
some old lover's ghost. Who died before the
God of Love was born”; “The spider
love”; “Wliat miracles we harmless lovers
wrought” ; and of couplets :
Nor can you more judge woman’s thoughts by tears,
Than by ‘ her shadow what she wears.
And all your graces no more use shall have
Than a sun-dial in a grave.
I must confess it could not chose but be
Profane to think thee anything but thee.
For last quotations :
Studv me then, you who shall lovers be
At the next world, that is, at the next spring.
’Twere profanation of our joys
To tell the laity our love.
And the well-known passage from “The Sec-
ond Anniversary”:—
Her pure and eloquent blood
Spoke in her cheeks and so distinctly wrought,
That one might almost say her body thought.
From the fruits of Donne’s many and
varied musings on death, a subject he
approaches from almost every conceivab'e
angle, might be made another collection ot
wonderful phrases. Taking here and thei e
one from out a score,*we obtain half a dozen
such jewels as: “Death, else a desert, grown
a court by thee” ; “In her this sea of death
has made no breach” ; “Our body’s as the
womb. And as a midwife death directs it
home” : “So long as till God’s great V emtc
change the song” (which Saintsbury regards
as the finest line in English sacred poetry,
describing it as “a ‘Dies Irf and a V emte
itself in 10 English syllables ) ; And the
world’s busy noise to overcome, look so
much death as served for opium ; and that
sublime thought of death as but a groom.
Who brings a taper to the outward room.
This leaves altogether out of account the
three fine epithalamia, full of consummate
touches of imagery, and with one excellent
refrain, “To-day puts on perfection and a
woman’s name” ; the elegies (“To His Mis-
tress Going to Bed” is a forerunner, if a
line of descent can be made out between
sixteenth-century “metaphysical” poetry and
modern impressionistic vers fibre, of Wall
Whitman’s “A Woman Waits for Me ) ; the
divine poems; the 30-odd verse-letters (Drum-
mond of Hawtliornden records for us that
Ben Jonson “had by heart ’ a passage in
“The Calm,” part of an epistle written when
Donne accompanied Essex to the Azores in
1597 in an expedition to intercept the Span-
ish plate-fleet) ; the epigrams; “The Pro-
gress* of the Soul,” an unfinished satire,
using as machinery the Pythagorean doctrine
of the transmigration of souls; the satires
proper, besides various minor efforts.
Walking through a garden in summer, one
can but gather a handful from a living,
brilliant world of flowers, a pitiful tribute
by which to carry away the rich memory
of a cosmos of scent and color. So from
his own perusal of Donne’s poems one can
but offer to another a colorful, but bow
inadequate, nosegay of peerless phrases.
Donne must be read. And such is the pecu-
liar, subtle personality of the man it is
almost inevitable that those who read him
should either, as a great critic has said,
“scarcely be able to see flow any decent
and intelligent human creature could like
him,” or else “curb and restrain the expres-
sion of their love for fear it should seem
on that side idolatry.”

A Satchel of Books
Sally Warner, by Florence M. Irby (Angus and
Robertson.) A healthy Australian story for and
about young folk. Sally is a bush girl knowing
little of the world beyond the farm. Misfortune
visits the home and Sally marries in haste to repent
at leisure, but in the end love rights all. Scattered
through the novel, which moves brightly, are passages
showing an intimate acquaintance with the bush.
Apparently, a first novel and a promising one.
Faith and Success , by Basil King (Allen and
Unwin). There is something humorously American
in Mr. King’s quest for a faith “that would do
something for me here and now.” Discontented with
the conventional religious concept of faith, the
author endeavors to convert it into a dynamic force
which will act upon the practical affairs of life by
directing and stimulating individual effort to the
full expansion of its potentialities. As a psycho-
theological tonic for those who can take such draughts
it may effect its purpose.
The University of Hard Knocks, by Ralphe Parlette
(Angus and Robertson). “The menace of America,”
writes this author, “lies not in the swollen fortunes,
but in the shrunken souls that inherit them. It is
the educated, the rich and the worldly wise who
blunder most in the training of their children.
Poverty is a better trainer for the rest.” That in
effect is the burden of this collection of lecture notes
by an American professor, whose dictum is probably
true so long as you qualify poverty. This is an
Australian edition of what looks like another best-
seller. •
Mape, by Andre Maurois (John Lane). “In Mape
it never rains. 'Everyone plays all day in vast
garden's. Everyone is happy. The small children
choose their parents out of shops. At eight o’clock the
grown-ups are sent to bed and the little boys take
the little girls out to the theatre.” Such is the
conception of Franqoise of an utterly perfect universe
for small girls. Into this subjective world of
the imagination Maurois weaves the lives of three
outstanding personalities, Goethe, Balzac and Mrs.
Siddons. A very ingenious conception which allows
play for the fantastic imagination and yet analytical
powers of this writer.
The Venetian Glass Nephew, by Elinor Wylie
(Heinemann). As fragile and as full, of color and
design as the crystal of Morano. It tells how
Cardinal Peter Innocent Bon, with the heart of
a bov at the age of 82, is constrained by Luna the
glassblower to visit his establishment. There, in
an atmosphere of magic is given to him Virginio, a
figure of glass that takes on mortality. llow this
wondrouslv begotten nephew falls in love with
Rosalia, “more vital than spring roses or npeifcng
fruit ” and how she was constrained “to fear God
and love Virginio all in the space of five seconds,”
is told in a story of imaginative charm and beauty.

“Sydney Jephcott”: In a recent issue information
was asked about the authorship of the poem (usually
printed as A. L. Gordon’s) with the quatrain beginning
“Life is mostly froth and bubble.’’ One of Marcus
Clarke’s last contributions to the press was an
article on this very subject in the Leader about 1882.
He gave convincing evidence that the poem w r as
written by Mowbray Morris, afterwards best known
by his editorship of the “Badminton” series of
sporting handbooks. Clarke’s article was interesting
enough to have remained in my memory for the last
44 years.
Max Meldriun has not gone back to live
in France, as stated (B. 6/5/’2G), but is just on
holiday. After spending 12 or 18 months in Picardy,
where he hopes to get some good work done, he
will probably leave for the States on a lecturing
tour and will then return to Australia. That the
artist’s teachings have been abandoned bv many
of his students after “they gained experience is
arguable. He has no more experienced pupils than
Colin Colahan and Justus Jorgensen (in France),
John Farmer and A. Colquhoun, jun. (just returned),
Clarice Beckett and A. M. E. Bale, all of whom are
most sincere in their appreciation of their old
teacher. Those that have been abroad and seen
everything to be seen are indeed keener than ever.
For my own part I believe his logical views and
restraining influence are mainly responsible for the
normal state of Art in Australia to-day.
“A. It. Ward”: T. Jasper (R.P. G/5/’2G) says
that “Christianity carried out an age-long offensive
against the sex instinct, and in so doing strengthened
that which it hoped to decrease.” This calls for
an answer. The fact was that all round the
eastern Mediterranean the various peoples had a
goddess, known variously as Ashtoreth, Mylitta,
Astarte, Aphrodite, Venus, and probably as mam
other names as there were languages. But it was
evervwhere the same goddess, and the sacrament of
the goddess was adultery. The temples were staffed
with priestesses for the convenience of worshippers
who were unable to bring a woman with them. The
acid remarks of the prophets about “going whoiing
after the gods of the nations” was not a figuie of
speech, but a fact. It is true that the early Church
rushed to the other extreme, and the remedy proposed
if carried out in its entirety would have resulted
in the extinction of the race. Yet the provocation
was very great.
“Ida Lee” (Mrs. Marriott) from London:
“Ancient Mariner” (B. 31/12/"25) criticises some
statements in my book “Early Explorers in Aus-
tralia.” He writes: “I cannot accept Ida Lee’s state-
ment.... that Cook’s Endeavour flew the white
ensign as she nosed her way along our eastern sea-
board. What she flew was the red ensign.” He
follows up these remarks with another criticism.
“Again, the volume informs us that ‘on the night of
April 30—-by civil reckoning—Cook lost one of his
ship's company', Forby Sutherland.’ If this is
meant to imply that Forby took his last departure
on April 30 as civil time is now computed locally,
the authoress is quite wrong.” I forwarded the
cutting to Mr. W. G. Perrin, Admiralty Librarian,
who has sent me the enclosed letter, giving me
permission to make use of it. Mr. Perrin’s letter
is appended, and 1 shall be glad if you will print
it: “Dear Mrs. Marriott, —I cannot say for certain
what was the ensign flown by ‘Endeavour in 1769,
but my personal opinion is that you are both wrong,
and that the ensign'was blue. I think that H.M.
ships engaged on surveying duties flew the junior
(i.e. the blue) ensign, and that this was the normal
practice for all ships on detached duties and not
under the orders of a flag officer. Certainly the
contemporary water-color of ‘Resolution’ and ‘Dis-
covery’ by Webber (now here in the Library) shows
blue ensigns for both ships. On the other point
you are right. The writer in The Bulletin has
mistaken the astronomical day, which began at noon.
12 hours after the civil day, for the nautical day,
which began 12 hours before the civil day and 24
hours after the astronomical day. Thus p.m. of
May 1 in ship’s time 1770 would be undoubtedly
p.m. of April 30 by civil reckoning.—Yours sincerely,
W. G. Perrin.” "

Is it not strange that for hundreds of
years man has been scrubbing his face
with soaps containing soda, and has never
reasoned that under such treatment the
skin may suffer? Nothing is more ugly
than a face that looks raw. Shaving
soaps are always the same old method
of shaving. They are made with soda.
But now we have discovered SHAVE A,
the natural method, where no brush and
soaps containing soda are needed.
FREE SAMPLES
One can shave with Shavex in half the
time, and you will get a smoother and
closer shave than you have ever had,
and shaving will become a pleasure. Your
skin will look and feel like satin, and
your face under this treatment will look

required when using Shavex, for it is a

Crepuscule.
Noav do the little buds enfold
Themselves in cloaks of powdered gold.
The spider dreams upon his leaf;
The mouse, within the haycock slieat
1 )oth drowse, doth drowse
Beside his spouse.
Then, since no fairy stays awake,
Let us their good example take;
And, softly bedded on this rise,
Bid filmy sleep invade our eyes.

Inland.
I am so far away,
And the wintry sea is leaping.
A white Aving, a lone wing
Over the sand is sweeping.
I am so far away,
And the sea-grass hoav is thrumming;
And the wind calls, and the rain calls
“Little one, when are you coming /
The black piles groan and creak
(Oh, wherefore am I knowing’/),
And over the spits, the wide spits,
The creamy tide comes floAving.
The pale sea-berries hang
Where the tossed driftwood is tangled ;
And the red shells, the rose shells,
Lie where the shore is spangled.
Up on the salt-stung plain
Are the blue buds softly waking,
With the frail bells, the heath-bells,
Under the brushwood breaking.
Up from the crumbling cliff,
Where the wind and the water harry,
The deep calls, and the wild calls,
“Little one, why do you tarry?”
I am so far away !
So far, and yet I’m knowing.
O sad heart, O sea-heart—
God ! If I Could be going!

River Wind.
The river Avind is calling
Through the dusty city street.
With its towering sun-cracked buildings
And its window’s white Avith heat;
The river wind comes calling
And its voice is passing sweet.
It tells of dappled shallows
Where the whispering bamboos lean,
A wave of flaunting yellow'
Or a weft of emerald green ;
And in the deepest shadow
A patch of purple sheen.
Limpid waters at the dawning
And a pale enamelled sky;
Fiery blood-red tides of splendor
As the flaming sunsets die.
And a whirl of white Avings lifting
When the wild gulls dip and fly.
A tangled maze of shipping,
Or a crazy foreign tune,
Almond eyes and lemon faces
And the blue imperial noon :
Ships of war or trade or plunder
Stealing forth beneath the moon.
The river Avind is calling
Like a wraith, half-mockingly,
Through the dusty, crowded city;
’Tis a siren voice to me,
With its song of open waters
And the salt kiss of the sea!
QUEENSLAND.

The Wenving.
Weft of night and warp of day!
In a swift, insensate weaving.
Hoav the untiring shuttles play!
Warp of joy and weft of grieving, *
Crimson threads and drab and grey
Cross an ever-changing pattern,
Working cloth for clod or fay.
Cloak of prince or shawl of slattern.
Warp of day and weft of night!
Magic robes of month or season
Shine upon the startled sight,
Shine and fade in smooth unreason—
Warp of wrong and weft of right.
Worth true-hearted and specious showing,
Till the shadowed dark and light
Pass beyond all mortal knowing.
Warp of peace and weft of steel.
Spotless now and now bespattered,
Muddied o’er from helm to heel
Where the war-god’s wains have clattered!
Lord! Before the loom I.reel,
Of the restless years despairing!
Naked, Lord, behold I kneel
With no garment worth the wearing!

Freedom.
The cup was mine : I tilled it,
Then sold it for a song.
The field was mine: I tilled it,
Then left it overlong.
So now I lightly wander
With water, earth and fire.
Set free from need to squander
The spoil of my desire.
There shall be no more kisses
For duty held in fee ;
The winds’ unruly blisses
Hold better luck for me.
The roads shall know my singing,
The hedge shall know me'true
When the Avide earth is ringing
With things I need not do.

ONE COMMONWEALTH AND
ANOTHER.
It is safe- to assume that the outcome of the
negotiations between the Commonwealth and
the States for the straightening of financial
and other tangles will be unsatisfactory. If
last week’s conference, or a subsequent one,
doesn’t make it sufficiently unsatisfactory
the State Legislatures will proceed to sug-
gest amendments which will supply all the
confusion anticipated, and some over for good
measure. The Commonwealth began with
a Constitution under which it had far too
little authority, in matters of finance especi-
ally, and in most other matters. As the
States increased their debts from 200 to
600 millions in 25 years, and particularly
as they increased those debts from 400 to
600 millions in the final six years, and in
some cases acquired violent swelled head
with much spending, the rottenness of the
position became accentuated. Power of a
mild sort for the amendment of the Con-
stitution has always existed, but the one
reul streak of luck the Central authority had
in that line was when it got the right to
take over the entire State debts, or any por-
tion of them, instead of only the original
200 millions. If it had exercised that: right
to the extent even of taking over the small-
est debt per head in its entirety and a cor-
responding amount of the. others, and if it
had imposed a fairly solid redemption tax
to provide for repayment, it would have in-
spired_ respect and set its authority growing.
And if it had repeated the process when
there were enough new debts to be worth
taking over, it might have inspired more re-
spect. Unfortunately, it drifted into the
habit of being disregarded, and it has a weary
distance to go before it regains the influence
with which it began.
* * * *
As matters stand the Commonwealth can't
build railways to its own ports (outside the
N.T.) without State permission. It almost
certainly wouldn’t get this even if it asked,
and if it asked for and received authority,
the ownership of a number of petty isolated
branches, wholly dependent on adjacent
State lines for access, would lead to nothing.
As one consequence, three out of the four
good ports of N. S. Wales are practically
closed against Federal commerce. The Cen-
tral Government has no control over rail-
way construction or management or gauges
in its own States. It can’t even reach its
own capital if one big State refuses to fur-
nish the necessary train, unless it hires its
own vehicle and proceeds over the State
roads. It can’t subdivide States. Nor has
it any authority in the matter of State legis-
lation or the appointment of State Gover-
nors; and a State Governor isn’t a wholly
negligible institution, as shown by the case
of Bill Lennon and the abolition of the
Queensland Upper House, as well as some
other matters. If some Communistic State
Government decided, with the countenance
of its own Bill Lennon, to do without a
session of its one-House Parliament, or to
cut it down to a one-day sitting for the pur-
pose of passing the Estimates en bloc, it is
difficult to say exactly wliqt the people at
alleged headquarters could do about it.
When the A.L.P. Conference skipped a year,
and met next year only to be sent home
again by a minority vote, nobody appeared
able to do anything. The Commonwealth
is a long, long way from exercising, or pos-
sessing, or attempting to acquire the right
to prevent State Governments mortgaging
its subjects beyond the chance of redemption.
Instead it has itself lent them some 22 mil-
lions out of the proceeds of the note issue,
and financed them with some 75 millions
additional for land gambles under the head
of “soldier settlement.” Then the Federal
Old Man at Melbourne began to back his
State sons’ lOU’s in London on condition
that they didn’t clash with his own lOU, he
being in the business himself. The prece-
dents set up are so mixed as to create an
impression outside that in the last resort the
Old Man is responsible for his sons’ debts,
and that at the last resort the sons
are not responsible for his debts, nor
very responsible for their own either.
The Commonwealth has no land worth men-
tioning of its own for settlement purposes
save in the Territory, where it has plenty.
It might have built up a populous province
of its own there, but State interests forbade
the construction of the through railway.
Also, devices were fixed up by which no one
could buy agricultural land in the N.T., nor
lease more than a paltry area for purely
agricultural purposes. As for the miscel-
laneous powers which the Old Man possesses,
but doesn’t use because the State Govern-
ments have got into the habit of using them
and would be cross if disturbed, they are too
many to even mention.
* * * *
It is not easy to say which would be the
best point at which to commence the repair
of the ramshackle political edifice, but if a
party rose, or if some good and strenuous
Australian raised a party with a large re-
pairing programme, a beginning might be
made somewhere. Two other sections of the
British Empire are run on more or less
Federal principles, but their Central Govern-
ments never had the soft, indulgent way of
ours. Perhaps one reason is that tlieir
people had frequently seen war at their
doors, and had been hardened by tribulation.
Both in Canada and South Africa the Cen-
tral authority is the great railway owner.
The Canadian provinces may own railways,
as well as canals and telegraphs, but not
such as connect with those of an adjacent
province. The powers that be at Ottawa
may declare any variety of public works
national, and take charge. In both coun-
tries the provincial Excellencies are appointed
by the Governor-General, so there are no
irritating breaks when some political parti-
san runs the show on nurely partisan prin-
ciples. Laws passed by the minor Legisla-
tures in Afrikander-land require the assent
of the Governor-General, which means his
Ministers, as well as that of the minor
potentate. The Canadian provinces borrow
at will, but lacking railway construction as
a plausible pretext they don’t borrow so
much, and the Head Otfice Administration
doesn’t back the bills. The South African
provinces can borrow only irom the Old Man
at Pretoria, and every loan carries a sinking
fund. In each Dominion the provinces are
dependent on subsidies from the chief
Treasury for part of their income, and in
South Africa half the provincial expenditure
may be met from this source. It must not
be more than half, except that the two
weaker provinces receive a small fixed sub-
sidy in addition. The “fiscal independence”
of subsidised provinces like these naturally .
doesn’t enter into the question, and it is
possible that their lowly status makes for
peace and moderate living. The Central Par-
liaments of the other two Dominions legis-
late for many purposes which are here left
to the States, mostly because our Common-
wealth has _ been a yielding and ladylike
creature all its life, and their Federal control
of civil and criminal courts would stagger
the _ average Australian—until he got used
to it. With so many responsibilities the
Governments at Ottawa and Pretoria must
naturally keep tlieir hands on many sources
of revenue. They are doubtless very ordi-
nary concerns regarded as examples of all
the Christian virtues, but they have a cer-
tain upstanding quality which is better than
being Christian, and they are not addicted
to the doormat act in tin 1 same degree as
their Australian prototype.
WHAT “SECONDARY” INDUSTRIES
HAVE DONE FOR AUSTRALIA.
There are signs of a Foreign-trade recrudes-
cence in N. >S. Wales, and to a less extent in
other States. It may have just happened,
like a crime epidemic or a violent fluctuation
in the lunacy statistics, or it may be a premedi-
tated campaign. Working in its favor is the
sad fact that the Ma State is cursed at the
moment with a Government in which the
manufacturing element is practically, if not
wholly, without representation. The band of
half-baked theorists in power has an idea
that it is the proper caper to persecute
"secondary” industry by strikes and wild
enactments about more pay for loss work,
with a possible view to the ultimate “taking
over” of the factories and workshops on
Moscow principles. It knows, though, that
it isn't worth while persecuting the farmer
in the same way, for Moscow experience
showed that the “nationalisation” of agricul-
ture is hopeless. With the impression thus
made that local factory production is in for
a bad time, the Freetrade importing agents
for foreign factories have reckoned it a good
time to join in, and their output of printed
misrepresentation about “prohibitive tariffs”
and the like has boomed wonderfully. But
not everything is in favor of a successful
resuscitation of the disease. It is, for one
thing, impossible to swell our bloated im-
ports much without the country going bank-
rupt through the continued raising of ex-
traneous loans to meet surplus liabilities;
nor does it seem possible even to maintain
anything like the present rate of bloat with-
out the country going bankrupt from the
same cause, though not quite so soon.
**t * *
It is interesting to speculate as to what
might have been the luck of N. S. Wales if
Federation and a fairly sane, though insuffi-
cient, Protectionist tariff hadn’t arrived, and
if the State had remained true to separation
and the Shoddy Cause. It has advantages
which should make it better able than its
neighbors to exist despite the vagaries of
fools, scoundrels and importers. It is the
most populous State, though during the
palmy days of Foreign-trade it wasn’t. It
is so rich in minerals that it produces two-
thirds of the whole output of the Common-
wealth, though it showed no such activity
when the Cobden crowd ran the show. It
is pre-eminent in cows, sheep, wool and
wheat. It owns four out of the Common-
wealth’s 17 allegedly good ports, three of
them unused. In short, as places go in Aus-
tralia, which isn’t fitted by Nature to carry
a very dense human stock, it is just the
place where the so-called “primary” indus-
tries should have developed their capacity
for supporting a large civilised population
if the capacity was in them, and it had
plenty of commercial hot-gospellers to encour-
age its people to the effort. These are some
of the results:—

yard, Forests, All Fac-

It might have been a cold day for poor old
Ma if she had taken the advice of the bad
characters who surrounded her, and resolved
to stick to the alleged “primary” industries,
for population increased by some 935,000 be-
tween 1901 and 1924, and there were 654
fewer “primary” jobs to support them. The
area under cultivation, including artificial
grasses, increased threefold, but the people
who tried to live by cultivating it diminished
in 25 years from 77,600 to 50,000. A great
deal of the toilworn. careworn, impoverished
hand-labor of early days was replaced
by machinery, much of it locally invented
and locally manufactured despite the bitter
profanity of the Freetrade importing clan,
which says that all such apparatus should
be brought, through the medium of itself,
from the protected factories of iCanada and
the United States. If nothing of the sort
had happened N. S. Wales would be a poor
place, with some wool and coal barons and
a smattering of peasantry. Incidentally, the
Freetrader is still shouting incoherent pro-
fanity against Australian farm machinery,
or he was last week.
* * * *
Taking the Commonwealth as a whole, the
painstaking Statistician shows these as the
aggregate results for the eight years 1917-
24 inclusive:—
Gross output of manufactured goods. . £2,293,224,000
Gross output of “primary” industries,
including fish and minerals .. 1,878,843,000
Advantage for manufactures .. £414,381,000
On these figures it is difficult to see what
Australia would have lived on if it had
stuck to the raw-material game. The case
is worse than it looks, for it would have
been a poor lookout for the alleged primary
person if the “secondary” person hadn’t been
around in ever-increasing numbers to help
provide a local market for 55 per cent, of his
goods. Moreover, his trade would look infi-
nitely worse than it does if account was
taken of the fact that it is the factory artisan
who turns milk into butter and cheese, cane
into sugar, vines into brandy, much wheat
into flour, and some wool into tops, and if
the value of these and other services was re-
moved from the “primary” to the manufac-
turing list. It is possible to find figures
showing the aggregate value of the work done
in factories, barring the fact that the “pri-
mary” man takes credit for a fair amount
of it —that is, the value added by skill and
industry to the original raw material. In-
formation of that sort is scarce in other
lines, though it would be most interesting.
In many gold-mining districts, for instance,
the seed sown in the shape of calls and sub-
scriptions exceeds the value of the finished
product by a dreadful amount per cent. But
the net value set. down to the credit of Aus-
tralian manufactures (£758,121,000 for the
last eight years) exceeded the gross value of
the pastoral business by £56,000.000 and the
gross value of the agricultural output by
£146,000,000. And there is still abundant
room for, more factories—almost unlimited
room.
THE A. A. COMPANY.
It is a hundred years this mouth since one of
the most unaccountable blunders in Austra-
lian land settlement was perpetrated at Port
Stephens, when the Australian Agricultural
Quite unlimited as to optimism—sat
down on the shores of that beautiful and
neglected inlet with the intention of. making
a fortune for its English shareholders out of
land that produces magnificent timber, but
Js otherwise! hardly fit for a wallaby pasture.
Certainly, in these days, the rabbits think
very little of it. Practically the only things
naturally good at Carrington, where the
headquarters were established on the north-
ern side of the big haven’s inner basin, are
the view, the oysters and the tall trees. If,
in these days, a great corporation with
i 1,000,000 in capital were to locate itself
in similar country with the expectation the
directors of the A. A. Co. professed to hold,
the howl of laughter resulting would echo
round the Commonwealth, and they would
stand a very fair chance of prosecution for
something or other that would look like de-
frauding those who had invested their money
in its schemes. And yet, in 1826, the co. was
made quite welcome to select land on the
eastern side of the continent almost any-
where between Cape Otway and Cape York,
had a local advisory committee to do the
selecting for it, and was guaranteed practi-
cally unlimited free labor in working what-
ever estate it might take up. It is one of
the most curious stories in early Australian
history—how it came to be saved from the
results of its mistake, almost in spite • of
itself. If it had not been for the fact that
the British Government was tired of work-
ing the Newcastle coalfields unprofitably, the
highly successful A. A. ICO. would not this
year be celebrating its centenary, but would
merely be the subject of some speculative
paper to be read before the Royal Australian
Historical Society. It is difficult not to take
the cynical view that its local advisers did
not want it to succeed when they took up
the huge block of land between the Karuah
and Manning rivers, which was their first
choice, but time has amply demonstrated
that this proceeding was nothing other than
innocent foolishness.
The preliminary meeting held in London
in April, 1824, for the purpose of forming
the company announced its designs. It was
to be given a million acres of land, on which
it was “to form an agricultural establish-
ment for the purpose of raising fine wool
and, subordinate to that object, cultivating
the vine, olive, flax and other productions
now imported from the shores of the Medi-
terranean.” It was to encourage emigration,
and it was to relieve the Government of a
large part of the burden of finding employ-
ment for and supporting persons who had
been transported to Australia for criminal
offences. The Government was charmed with
the idea, modified it a little, and on June 21
passed “an Act for granting certain powers
and authorities to the company to be incor-
porated by charter to be called the Austra-
lian Agricultural Company for the cultiva-
tion and improvement of waste lands in
the Colony of New South Wales, and for
other purposes relating thereto.” There is
no doubt that, under the guarantees the
Government insisted on, the formation of the
company was a good thing for Australia, nor
is there any doubt that it has done .valu-
able work in pioneering during the century
of its existence; but it came very near to
being wrecked by the folly of its beginnings.
Surveyor-General Oxley had recom-
mended that it should take up land in the
newly-discovered country on the Liverpool
Plains, but, since it wanted a port for the
convenience and cheapness of water-carriage,
had suggested an alternative in the Port
Stephens district. The committee made its
first mistake by not insisting on the appoint-
ment jto the local management of a man
who had “colonial experience,” and its second
and worst when it permitted a “newchum”
like Robert Dawson to decide on the Port
Stephens location. Jesse Gregson, for
many years the company’s superintendent
and. its historian, has no illusions as to
these errors. lie points out how hasty and
superficial were the steps taken to secure
suitable country, and bolds the committee
mainly responsible.
In May, 1826, Dawson, with about 100
settlers and convicts, a guard of soldiers and
the stock imported from England (720 sheep,
15 thoroughbred horses and 12 head of
cattle), together with some that had been
acquired locally, established himself at Port
Stephens. Within 12 months the inevitable
happened. “Distracted between the proposals
of the English directors (who wanted to
add silk, tobacco, sugar and cotton to the
already long list of desired products), the
competition with private settlers for assigned
servants (which waS rapidly earning the
company great unpopularity) and the diffi-
culty of growing fine wool either on the
coarse coastal pasturage or in the rough
country inland, Dawson let the settlement
run to seed, and was in the end suspended
by the local committee. John Macarthtir,
himself taking charge for a time, came to
the conclusion that success was impossible,
and the enterprise was on the brink of
failure.” And then the prospects of the co.
suddenly took a change for the better. The
London directors got rid of the blundering
local committee, appointed Sir Edward
Parry, of Arctic fame, sole manager of its
Australian estate, and accepted the British
Government’s offer of its coal-mines at New-
castle. It was this latter piece of luck which
mainly saved the bacon. The co. received
a grant of 2000 acres of the Newcastle coal-
field, with Avliat amounted to a virtual mon-
opoly of coal-mining in N. S. Wales for 31
years. Sir Edward Parry promptly con-
demned the larger part of the Port Stephens
holding, and managed to arrange that half
of it should be exchanged for land elsewhere.
In spite of the indignant protests of Gover-
nor Bourke, and of many prominent land-
holders in the colony, the worst part of tin;
Port Stephens mistake was surrendered for
an equivalent area on the Liverpool Plains,
which became those magnificent stations
Warrali and Goonoo Goonoo. A new com-
pany was formed in 1850, composed almost
wholly of shareholders of (lie A. A. Go., to
take over the latter property, and it has
since been exploited by the Peel River Land
and .Mining Go. A directors’ report of that


time is a good deal more cock-a-whoop than
some of the earlier ones were, when it men-
tions that “the original capital of the Aus-
tralian Agricultural Co. will virtually be
paid back to the proprietors with an addi-
tion of £ls per share, while the company
will retain two valuable estates of more than
700,000 acres, the north shore of the harbor
of Port Stephens, its extensive property at
Newcastle and a coalfield of 2000 acres, to-
gether with a contiguous property of 2000
acres more.”
Half the acreage of Warrah and a large
slice of Goonoo Goonoo has been made avail-
able for closer settlement of late years, and
the company has given up coal-mining, but
it still earns a crust and a little butter for
its shareholders. And the “circle-dot” cattle
and the Warrah wool are still something
above the average. On the whole, the com-
pany deserves some gratitude from Australia.
The most unfortunate thing about its story
is that it seems to have left a sort of curse
on Port Stephens, for that splendid habor
remains much as it was when Sir Edward
Parry rilled its hinterland, with the disci-
pline of the quarterdeck, from Tahlee House
at Carrington.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Labor Becomes a State Frights Party.
In Australian Labor’s great days it was
vigorously Nationalist, but ever since it blew
out its brains in. 1916 it has been degenerat-
ing into a State Frights party. The final
stage of degeneration was reached at last
week’s conference in Melbourne, when the
Bruce-Page proposals for the separation of
Commonwealth and State finance were
opposed by four State Labor Premiers and
the deputy of a fifth on State Frights
grounds. From the good Australian point
of view there is little merit in the Bruce-
Page scheme. It would certainly terminate
the 255. per head payments out of Common-
wealth revenue which should have ceased
in 1920, but it would throw another impost
—that on Commonwealth loan interest—into
the existing chaos of Federal and State in-
come-taxes, Federal and State land-taxes,
Federal and State amusement-taxes and
death duties; also, by obliging the Federal
Government, which has tremendous war bills
to meet, to depend so largely on Customs
revenue it would endanger the national
fiscal policy. Another objection, and a very
important one, is that it contains no pro-
vision for taking over any portion of the
State debts. But that the thing should be
strenuously objected to by five State Labor
Governments, not because it is insufficiently
national, but because it isn’t unadulterated
State Frights, is enough to make Tui>or,
McGregor, Frazer, Batchelor, Hutchi-
son and other departed Laborites who were
good Australians turn in their graves'. The
four Labor Premiers and Lang’s deputy
McKell expressed the same bigoted provin-
cialism that actuated the Tories who drew
up the financial agreement or swindle of
1909. McKell garbled history as follows: —
■ It was never intended by the States that the whole
of the income from customs and excise should go
permanently to the Commonwealth. His own opinion
was that if it were thought for a moment by the
States that they Were to lose the whole of customs
and excise, it would have been doubtful whether the
people would have agreed to federation. John
Fohrest had said at the conventions of 1897-98 that
the division of this revenue was one of the most
difficult problems to be solved, and eventually an
arrangement was made for a perpetual payment
to. the States —as far as it could be made perpetual.
The Surplus Revenue Act was the outcome of a
conference of Premiers and the Prime Minister in
1909, when a definite agreement was reached. It
laid down that the financial relations of the States
and Commonwealth should be placed on a sound and
permanent basis. It was designed to assure to the
States a certain annual income now proposed to be
taken away. There was no mention in agree-
ment of a 10-year or any other period.
The reply to this rubbish is (1) that the
Constitution, as accepted by the people,
authorised the Commonwealth to retain
all the customs and excise revenue after the
expiration of 10 years; (2) that the agree-
ment or swindle of 1909 aimed at an amend-
ment of the Constitution guaranteeing the
States 255. per head for all time; (3) that
it was vigorously fought on national grounds
by the Labor party (not then a State Frights
body) and rejected by the people; (4) that
the Surplus Revenue Act was not “the out-
come of a conference of [Tory] Premiers'
and the [Fusionist] Prime Minister in 1909,”
but the outcome of a popular referendum and
election in 1910; (5) that it was passed by a
Labor Government and expressly limited to
10 years, which expired on July 1, 1920.
McKell and the four Labor Premiers were
welcomed into the State Frights fold by
Freetrade editors and Chamber of Commerce
importers, and quitted Melbourne with no
small opinion of themselves. But the Com-
monwealth Government could easily take the
shine out of them by announcing that there
would be no more per capita payments after
the present financial year, which closes on
June 30, and that it would be prepared to
consider applications for the taking over of
an equivalent amount of State debts, 44
p.c. liabilities for preference. That is what
a Commonw’ealth Grovernment with a modi-
cum of courage would do.

One Sort of Emigrant.
It was recently admitted by the Common-
wealth Minister for Migration that now and
again an emigrant who is not physically fit
gets past the British medical officers. He
does. A man who came to Australia from
England some time back with State assist-
ance was recently admitted to Goulburn
(N.S.W.) hospital in a collapsed condition.
He died very shortly afterwards, and an
autopsy, conducted by the local Government
medical-officer, revealed an extraordinary
assortment of chronic complaints in an ex-
treme form. His lungs had been attacked by
acute fibroid disease, the right one having
been completely destroyed, while the apex
of the left lung had also been affected. His
heart and liver were both enlarged to twice
their normal size and both kidneys were in a
diseased condition, one of them having ceased
to function. The thymus gland was swollen
to a marked degree, and the thyroid had
been attacked by G rave’s disease; further,
some of his bones had been affected by tuber-
cular caries. In short, there was scarcely
one of the more important organs of his body
which was not diseased, and practically all
these complaints were of fairly long standing.
What sort of medical examination could it
have been that failed to detect any of them.

Australian Steel.
If the historians go on labelling _ epochs
according to the most important material
used by man in the period, the time we live
in will be the Steel Age, just as the first
half of the last century, antedating BES-
SEMER's great invention, will be the Age o
Iron. There is not a civilised nation on the
globe to-day that does not give the making
and fabrication of steel a leading place amou»
its industries—essential both for purposes ol
defence and for peaceful progress. im-
portant nation is content to take a puicy
commercial view of the industry. Ihoug
it may be able to import supplies vciy
cheaply from nations possessed of superior
raw-material sources, it is considered unwise,
for a variety of good reasons, to submit to
such dependence. The chief reason, of course,
is that in time of war foreign trade is apt
to be dislocated, and a belligerent nation de-
pendent on imported steel would be speedily
disabled. There is also, in the case of nations
such as the United States, Britain and Aus-
tralia, possessed of rich resources in iron,
coal and limestone, the commonsense view-
expressed by one A. Lincoln, who remarked
that when his country imported 20 dollars
worth of steel America had the steel and
some other country had the dollars, whereas
if the stuff were made at home America had
the steel and the dollars. Yet it is scarcely
a quarter of a century since any Australian
ironmaster who talked about producing any-
thing but the most elementary forms ot steel
was regarded as a promising candidate tor
a mental asylum, and when it was confi-
dently asserted by men grown grey in the
iron trade that there never had been any
steel castings made in Australia and never
would be. To-day there are in the Common-
wealth 10 concerns that undertake the
smelting, casting and fashioning of the
metal, and between them they can
fill an order for anything that is made ot it,
and can produce it to any specification, ihe
coming of the electric furnace has been a
big factor in this development, and the Great
War assisted in a twofold way—by throw-
ing the Continent on its own resources to
an extent never before necessitated, and by
bringing about extremely important improve-
ments in production methods. The extent to
which the Australian industry keeps abreast
of the times is seldom realised, but it. is
none the less a fact that the Commonwealth
plants, taken generally, are at least as
up-to-date as any in the world. The prin-
cipal room for improvement is in the matter
of increased output. The industry employs
about 12,000 persons, and pays out three
millions a year in wages. That- is a very
good record for an infant, but it doesn t look
very big when compared with the field the
infant might grow to occupy. Australia im-
ports each year metal manufactures —mostly
steel —to the value of over 40 millions, The
total imports of iron and steel annually
amount to about 500,000 tons. There is no
item in the whole catalogue of such imports
that cannot be made in Australia. If the lot
were made here it would mean employment
for another 25,000 men, and a wages-bill
of close on 10 millions. Yet the seven Gov-
ernments of the country have all led the way,
at one time or another, in sending orders
abroad. It happens every week in more
than one State at the present time, and
many municipalities seem to have made it
an article of faith that Australian industry
ought to be discouraged. That atmosphere
must be banished —and in the case of the
steel industry it must be banished for rea-
sons affecting the very existence of the
nation.

The Cheese-paring Bill of Miser Pearce.
The Cheese-paring Bill of Land-Miser Pearce
for the promotion of ineffectual settlement
in the Northern Territory reached its second-
reading stage in the House of Reps, on a
recent day. Up to that time it hadn’t im-
proved. It appears that the leasehold or
perpetual-tenant system, with slowly-rising
rents, doesn’t push settlement even in Queens-
land, where there are railways, and certainly
it doesn’t in the N. Territory, where there
are practically none. It fails to attract the
small man, and apparently it. has no great
attractions for the medium-sized man, for
both in Queensland and the N.T. latest re-
turns (1923) showed a bigger area “occupied
by the Crown or unoccupied” than at some
previous date. Incidentally, “the Crown ’ is
a darned bad tenant. Agricultural man has
apparently the same unconquerable desire to
possess his own farm as to possess his own
wife, and, with due precaution against the
accumulation of great estates,. there is no
reason, apart from the chattering of street-
bred theorists, why he shouldn’t. In bitterly
reluctant acknowledgment of this fact, Min-
ister Pearce, himself a non-agricultural
product of the perpetual-lease academy
of thought, proposed to introducer the
freehold policy in the Territory with the
same intense caution as if it was a matter
of letting a tame gorilla hold the family
baby. • He has 200,000,000 acres of land un-
occupied, and 135,000,000 held under leases
which are running out, and any of which
could be resumed with moderate compensa-
tion. Out of this vastness he proposed to
allow the settler to buy not more than 1280
acres of Class 1 or 2560 acres of Class 2
land. First-class land in the Territory, bar-
ring the usual favored spots, isn’t particu-
larly first, and second-class land is very second.
And even first-class land is only fourth-
class if it is far enough away from an indus-
trial centre and from a railway or a bit of
navigable water. In fact, it may be only tenth-
class. Nobody contemplates the temperate
parts, or any other parts, of the great north-
central area as a region that will send its
surplus wheat or the like to the European
market at any date near enough to be worth
troubling about, and the proposed 1280 acres
is absurdly small for the sheep or cattle
business with some mixed farming thrown
in. TheN.S.W. Official Year Book mentions
that “the area to be purchased under residen-
tial conditions must not exceed 1280 acres
in the Eastern land division and 2560 acres
in the Central land division,” but what lias
applied in N. S. Wales, especially near the
coast, may not work in Central Australia.
The homestead farms of N. S. Wales are
much sought after (there have been 2551
applicants for one of them), and they flock
considerably round such promising spots as
Armidale, Grafton, Kempsey and Dubbo. In
1924 there were 3405 of them in existence,
and they covered 3,309,141 acres, so they
averaged 972 acres each. In 1914 the aver-
age size was 590 acres, but the idea of what
constitutes a living area has grown since
then. If either 590 or 972 acres is a fair
thing among the Northern Rivers of N. S.
Wales there is something grotesque about
the idea of 1280 acres in remote, unrailwayed
and almost roadless Central Australia. The
offer isn’t calculated to bring enough settle-
ment to pay for railways, or enough to make
the railways pay if they arrive. The ill-luck
of so much soldier-settlement arose out of
the effort to put 36,301 returned men (figures
to June, 1924) on too-economical areas, such
as hen-farms and fruit-farms in the Sydney
suburbs, at a cost of £35,000,000-odd. Aus-
tralia was once too lavish with its land. Now
it is afflicted with miserly theorists who hate
to part with any of it, and want to hoard up
the whole wilderness against a rainy day.
The Land of Topsy-turvy Politics.
“Cleveland”: Another reason for Labor re-
maining in continuous session in Queensland
is that the ballot is no longer secret—-it is
as open as anyone sufficiently interested in
finding out how, say, the public service voted
cares to make it. Section 51 of the Elections
Act, sub-sec. (3), says:—
Each ballot paper—
(a) Shall bear in the right-hand upper corner of
the face thereof a number which shall be machine-
printed or otherwise legibly marked thereon; and
(b) Shall be so numbered in regular arithmetical
sequence beginning with 1, so that no two or more
of them shall bear the same number.
This number is concealed by turning oyer
the corner of the ballot-paper and gumming
it down; and it is also pencilled in against
the name of the voter on the roll. This is
held to be a check against plural voting,
though how effective this can be is pro-
blematical after consideration of the follow-
ing :
1. The ballot-number written against the name of
an elector on the roll is accepted as conclusive
evidence that a ballot-paper bearing that number was
used by a voter at one booth; but it would prove
nothing in the event of half a dozen voters claiming
a vote in his name at half a dozen different booths
at the same time.
2. To trace that one particular ballot-paper might
necessitate ungumming the whole of the ballot-
papers in that box. It would also be necessary to
open up all the ballot-papers in the other boxes to
sort out the fraudulent ones, when the whole secrecy
of the ballot would be destroyed.
3. Anyone wanting to see how the voting went
could precipitate or create the conditions which
demand that the numbers be opened up, so that to
chase one duplicate vote they would have to open
up genuine ones until they found the original.
The result is that civil servants vote Labor
because of what they suspect would happen
if they were known to have voted otherwise.
They ‘also know that it is possible for their
vote to be divulged, because nothing is secret
once the secret passes from their hands.

How the Territory Is Ruled
“Anophele” (Darwin) : Twelve months ago
Senator Peakce, Minister for Home and Ter-
ritories, announced to the world that he nad
solved the problem of providing an efficient
coastal service for the Northern Territory,
and that the southern taxpayer was to bear
the cost in the form of a subsidy of £10,(31X1
a year for three years. It was to be a
super-service with every cog well greased.
Newspapers applauded, and _ new hands
accepted it at face value, while old hands
smiled and said “Wait and see.” When an-
nouncing that he had signed the contract,
Peakce assured Territorians in general and
coastal settlers especially that the time-
table as laid down was far better than they
had asked for, and he and they could now
sleep safe in the knowledge that whatever
might happen the service was assured. Pre-
sently the vessel arrived, and proved to be
a worthy old tub, but quite suitable for the
job. After a little friction between the owner
and Tom Walsh had been settled she made
her maiden trip along the coast, and, all
things considered, she gave a very satisfac-
tory service to the settlers, for here was a
vessel that actually ran to a time-table, and
did so for a matter of five months. Trade
improved and gave great promise of a heavy
increase, while the passenger accommodation
was availed of to its full capacity. Those
on the . soil put in a larger acreage, and in-
vestments were made in plant and gear.
Suddenly it was announced that the Decem-
ber trip was to be the last, for the owner
had decided that with the encouragement he
was getting he would replace the Kinchella
with a larger and faster vessel that would
be placed on the run immediately. Without,
so far as we know, a word of protest from
the authorities, the vessel slithered off, but
up to date no other vessel has arrived to take
her place, though there is a vague promise
that one purchased and refitted in Germany
and called the Mars, but to be renamed, is
to arrive in June or July. Now comes
word from every settlement along the coast
that a very serious shortage of supplies
exists, far worse than ever previously, for
the deluded settlers had short-ordered on
their usual wet-season supplies so as to have
fresh lots rather than stale stuff on hand
early in April. All was well with the ser-
vice, and deliveries were assured for early
in March, so they were told. Crops have
been harvested, and waggons and teams have
been waiting at the river landings for
months; in several cases settlers and team-
sters have been reduced to living on lily-
roots and other aboriginal diet to carry
them over until the long-overdue supplies
come to hand. Local firms have done their
best to cope with the conditions existing;
but on account of the presence of the Kin-
chella all other shipping of a decent tonnage
was allowed to leave the Territory, and the
only vessels available are the small mission
luggers and the private yacht of the medical-
officer, which have been placed at the dis-
posal ’ of the distressed settlers. The best
that these vessels can do, though, is a matter
of 10 or 12 tons, to be split up amongst
half a dozen, some of whom have come jour-
neys of up \o 200 miles for provisions. These
supplies are barely enough to feed the team-
sters and their helpers, and for them to
return to the homesteads without loading
would only increase the distress.

Australia’s Wool Gets Poorer.
Wool-men, especially the young
and untravelled, have laughed at the mere
suggestion of rivalry in the matter of our
tine wools —have pooh-poohed the idea of
Australia being ousted from her proud posi-
tion. On the other hand, men of vision and
foresight who have studied the position
in other countries are alive to the'
danger which the past two or three
seasons have precipitated into our hori-
zon. They have openly deplored the sense
of false security into which the majority of
our pastoralists have been lulled, but it has
availed nothing. It is not suggested that any
country at present can produce wools in any
quantity to equal ours for fineness and tex-
ture ; but South Africa and South America
have made wonderful progress of late years,
and at our expense. They have imported
heavily of our most famous studs, and their
docks generally are on the up-grade. On
the other hand, Australia’s wools on the
whole are growing broader. That our stan-
dards are gradually falling away is, I know,
disputed by some authorities; but it is a fact
realised by buyers. During the past season
this has been most marked. The reason, of
course, is obvious to close students of the
market. There is not sufficient difference in
price between fine and broad types to encour-
age the breeding of the light-framed, weaker-
constitutioned, fine-woolled sheep. The pas-
toralist naturally will follow the market:
and, candidly, he welcomes the tone for
broad, shafty wools. Not only does he
obtain a more robust, drought-resisting
animal; he is also returned more weight of
fleece per head. It is to be regretted that
a large number of breeders are obsessed with
this idea, absolutely ignoring quality. Until
there is a satisfactory line of demarcation
between fine and broad types he will con-
tinue to breed away, and this is where the
danger lies—he won’t know when to stop!
With these two important factors in mind —
the standards of other countries growing
higher, Australia’s lower —it is reasonable
to assume that sooner or later the two will
reach par; and then what? Where will be
our supremacy in fine wools? Our rivals
will have the advantage of closeness to Euro-
pean manufacturing centres, and wliat then
of our monopoly of the world’s markets?
There will, of course, be some superior par-
cels, but generally our super-lines will be a
thing of the past. Naturally there will be
a great re-shuffle, but the damage will have
been done. Our breeders will commence to
“cull heavy,” but how much longer will it
take to breed back than it did to breed away!
On Australia’s studmasters a grave respon-
sibility rests. On the sale floor this season
it has been a matter of comment that even
some of our most famous studs have com-
menced to fall in line with the general de-
mand for broad types. It is to be earnestly
hoped that others of our studs do not follow
suit, for it is certain that fine wools will
again come into their own—that the ratio
of values will right itself.

Endowments for New States.
If Australia possessed a Government with
much bottled-up energy, a good deal of origi-
nality, and a streak of the original devil in
its composition, it might make the financial
mix-up an aid to the subdivision of unwieldy
areas. It could do this by announcing a
policy of really liberal financial assistance
to thinly-populated infant States, the aid to
taper off by degrees as they accumulated
inhabitants. To make the scheme more tan-
gible the proposal might be put in the form
of law. No harm can arise through making
provision for the babies though they haven't
arrived, for they may come some day. There
is a certain absurdity in giving a per capita
allowance to Sydney, Brisbane or Perth,
but there would be none in a handsome grant
to New England, or central Queensland, or
north-west Australia. The idea would put
new life into Separation movements, and even
some of the Big City people might cordially
approve. Those of them who are not
absolutely anchored in stodge might realise
that some new State capitals, with all their
futures and all their booms before them,
with public works to build and a solid en-
dowment to start with, would be places
for enterprising men to move to. The strug-
gle to sell desirable “estates” on the far
outskirts of the present great cities grows
hackneyed. A fetich of the moment is the
separation of Federal and State finance, but
older communities than ours haven’t reached
that goal yet, and are not grieving over the
fact.

The House That Dreamers Built.
It is almost worth considering whether a
more pressing political reform than any
which the Federal Government has yet con-
cerned itself with isn’t the alteration, if it.
is possible, of the Senate from what it ?.s
to somethin? like what the men who framed
Australia’s Constitution designed it to be.
Periodically the Commonwealth Prime Minis-
ter and Treasurer, or either of them, meet
the State Premiers and Treasurers, or some
of them, to obtain the opinions of the latter
as to whether certain projected Federal
legislation will be agreeable to the States
and, if not, why not. Almost invariably, as
happened last week, it transpires that it
will be disagreeable, and a lot of dreary
wrangling generally terminates in nothing
particular being done or something being
dropped. These conferences in themselves
are a pitiful admission of the breakdown of
the machinery of Federation. Did anything
like them, one may wonder, take place in the
early days of American union or of Canad-
ian federation? If not, how is it that
trans-Pacific Constitution-framers built so
much better than ours managed to do
with so much more precedent to help them?
The Federal Government was never expec-
ted to go to State Ministers for infor-
mation about what the States might think
on this or that: the Constitution sought
to insure that they should have their inform-
ants on the spot—inside their Cabinets even.
The Senate was to be the States House.
The Government would pass such legislation
in the House of Representatives as it deemed

advisable in the interests of the Common-
wealth, and the Senate would review and,
if necessary, revise it, each Senator being;,
in intimate touch with feeling in his own
State, from the point of view of that
State. It was all so beautiful in theory.
How were the Constitution-framers to know*
that, after, possibly, the tirst Federal election,.,
no Senator who wasn’t a vigorous party
man would have any more chance of retain-.;
ing or gaining a seat than a Representative,,
if indeed he would have as much? Yet it
seems strange now, looking back, that men
used to the rough-and-tumble and tense fac-
tionism of Australian politics should have
complacently believed in the possibility of
a Chamber where State (or anything else)
would count for more than party. The
Senator has become little more than a dupli-
cation, or an echo, of the Representative.
His chances of election depend in no way
on his capacity to subordinate purely
Federal interests to State ones; they depend
little on any wider or deeper knowledge of
the State than he may have acquired by
stumping it as a constituency; what they
do depend on is being on the ticket of the
dominant party of the moment in politics.
Hence Federal Ministers no longer dream of
applying to Senators to know how certain
proposals are likely to strike certain States,
recognising that Senators are unlikely to
have any fuller knowledge than themselves.
Instead, they arrange conferences with State
Premiers and Ministers who, whichever side
of politics they may be on, may at least
claim to have their fingers on the pulse of
public opinion to some extent. Such confer-
ences are really excrescences on the Con-
stitution, which never contemplated them. Is
it possible, even now, to make the Senate
a States House' or something more nearly
resembling one? It certainly will be impos-
sible so long as it is elected as at present.
A solution might be offered that the State
Parliaments should do the electing if the
State Parliaments themselves were properly
representative of the people; but, constituted
as they are, that will hardly fill the bill, no
matter what other safeguards might be intro-
duced.

Melbourne had the biggest railway smash
since electrification last week, when a train
ran into a stationary one at Caulfield. Three
people were killed and 4S more or less
severely injured. Clapp's trains travel close
up to 45 miles an hour between stops, and
sometimes enter stations at a speed of 30
miles an hour. They have traversed half
the length of the platform before their speed
is as low as 15 miles. The control of
signals outside Caulfield is automatic, and
is alleged to be fool-proof, but within the
station area it is handed over to human
hands- and brains. There seems to be a
weakness here in a system which works
at such high speed, and with such a quantity
of human merchandise, that sometimes only
four-minute intervals separate trains.

Most modern industries are a chiaroscuro in
which the bright side is balanced and some-
times overbalanced by the dark. People
enthused over the development of the rubber
business and then discovered it was largely
built on the enslavement of miserable abor-
igines in South America. The shadow side
of the. arrangement whereby the housewife in
St. Kilda heats her electric iron by turning
a switch is provided by the condition
of the workers’ camps at Yallourn,
where the Vic. Electricity Commission
generates from brown coal the power
which keeps Melbourne homes sweet and
clean. In this rural retreat 400 people,
including women and children, live in frowsy
shanties of canvas and wood, or often ver-
minous cubicles in barrack form, each cubicle
measuring 7ft. by 7ft. and Bft. in height.
In this officially created slum there is no
system of scavengering. Nightsoil is in-
terred by the occupier in his own allotment
and the efficiency of the method is not high.
There is even doubt about the quality of the
drinking water, as the result of revelations
provided by a medical report, Arbitration
Judge Powers considered the men were en-
titled to compensation for being compelled
by a casual Government to live in an insani-
tary slum. So he ruled that until the Com-
mission created conditions of ordinary
decency at Yallourn it must pay its
workers two shillings a week above the award
rate. The amount could be increased with
reason, but it is a good precedent. Its appli-
cation to all slovenly Government concerns
and to private companies not sufficiently
regardful of their employees’ well-being would
probably cause some miraculous improve-
ments.

It might do the Powers no harm, while dis-
cussing compulsory disarmament, to note
what the great idea has done for Germany,
to which it was applied by force some years
ago. Under pressure of circumstances, Ger-
many agreed to submit to a whole lot of anti-
militarist measures. How well they have
worked is told in recent cables describing
grand reviews of two German armies. The

Ihe Australian has his droughts which re-
duce the productivity of the soil, but the
Japanese lias annual cataclysms whereby he
loses it altogether. The latest, a volcanic
outburst, removed 12 miles if one river and
jfivemiles of another and buried hundreds of
padi holds; but it was incidental to the
annual devastation, which is computed at an
600 human lives lost and
t 2 500,000 damage done. There is a popular
delusion that the Mikado feeds all his happy
tiiildren. That is wrong. Only about is
million-acres out of a total of 04 millions
aiTe cultivated, the rest being mainly scenery
for tourists. Intensive agriculture on the
fertile part, assisted by the nightsoil from
the* cities, makes it possible to rear three
people on each acre, but they are not reared
according to the Australian acceptance of
the word. Starved would be the verdict
of iSie farm-worker of Tin Flat if he were
askdd to accept the dietary of the tenant
farmer of Hakodate. Despite stringent
economy the country itself supports only 40
millions of its 56 to 60 millions; which is
why thoughtful sons of Nippon regard with
censotrious eyes the spectacle of the Philip-
part of the Dutch East Indies and
the Northern Territory in occupation of a
careless handful when their economists have
told them that these lands together could
accommodate 200 million people without
anybody intruding on his neighbor’s toes.

can procure enough for all his flocks, so the
practice generally is is to draft out the best
of the breeders and concentrate on keeping
them alive. In many instances these dying
flocks are the result of very many years’
patient attention by Australia’s pastmasters
in stock breeding. All for the want of about
350 miles of rail with few engineering diffi-
culties except an occasional river!

“Buttenderry” : It is extremely doubt-
ful if we could supply any great num-
ber of the once reputable “Waler,”
even if the demand still existed (B.
6/5/’26). Just as the car is responsible for
the lessened demand from India and “the
East” for that once great horse, so is it
largely responsible for the fact that we
now breed fewer of him. It is a case of
supply and demand. But only very indirectly
can the car be blamed for the present marked
inferiority of our horse-flesh generally as
compared with even 10 or 20 years ago. The
Bulletin has often referred to the hypoc-
risy which advances the “encouragement of
the breed” as a reason why practically
every Australian day should be a race-day,
so that aspect of the question need not be
referred to, though it has an important bear-
ing on the subject. Another reason for the
decline and partial fall of the Waler is
this. Before most of our big holdings were
subdivided it was not unusual for 40 or 50
brood-mares to occupy, with their lord and
master, a paddock consisting of as many
square miles, and comprising, wherever pos-
sible, many different formations of country-
mountain ranges ; plains ; stony, rough patches,
etc. These were absolutely ideal conditions
for both mares and foals, which early in
life acquired a sure-footedness, a robustness
of constitution and stamina impossible under
present conditions. Often the youngsters
would be drafted out as yearlings and put
into a still larger paddock, and rarely would
they be broken in under four, five, or even six
years old. Broadly speaking, small paddocks
are not conducive to the rearing of the
best type of horse. They lack the wide
variety of feed and country that helped to
make the Waler the horse ,he was, and,
used year after year, they are apt to become
“liorse-sick.” Then again, young "uns are
broken in and set to work at a much earlier
HOIST WITH THEIR OWN PETARD.
“Although the miners agreed not to work mines manned by non-union
engine-drivers, they are grumbling bitterly at the unfairness of having to
lose wages as a result of the engine-drivers’ strike.”
The Miner : “Gripes, toe ought ter scrag yer — chuckin’ stones
in and frightenin’ the fish!”
The Engine-driver: “Gam, I learnt it from yous.”
age than formerly, and the fillies, many of
which eventually become brood-mares, miss
those few extra years of freedom and ranging
the open spaces. It seems to me that to
get our horses back as nearly as possible
to their former excellence two things are
necessary: (1) Abolish pony-racing, which
is. wholly responsible for a type of animal
miscalled horse a weedy, herring-gutted
creature that resembles a kangaroo-dog but
lacks its stamina- —that is to be seen all over
Australia; and (2) give our brood-mares
and youngsters the paddocks that offer the
greatest possible areas and the most diverse
formations.

“Clin Tonne” : “Stockowner’s” debit en-
tries in the ledger of travelling stock
accounts (B. 13/5/’26) require auditing.
During W. G. Ashford's reign as N.S.W.
Minister for Lands the whole of the stock
routes, including water, camping, travelling-
stock and camping reserves, were overhauled
with a view to extending or curtailing them
as was found necessary. The work went
on steadily in Ashford’s time and during
Peter Loughlin’s first regime. “Ziff”
Wearne closed down on it. but not before
the job to all intents and purposes was
finished. Ashford was far-sighted enough to
amend the Pastures Protection Act to pro-
vide that the sole care, control and manage-
ment <>l the reserves which were retained
was to be vested in the Pastures Protection
lxiards, and the boards were empowered to
collect rates from travelling stock to im-
prove the reserves under their control. The
boards have an entirely free hand. The legis-
lation was experimental, but it has been a
big success. In the old days the Lands
department gave all kinds of leases over
the reserves, and some of them are still in
existence. As they terminate, the board
steps in and takes over. A board may,
with the approval of the Minister for Lands,
grant the grazing right over a reserve for
not more than 12 months with a view to
having it improved. The Department, liow-
ei ns l evc ! l on this practice, arguing
hat the boards should do the job themselves.
As these boards are elected by the owners
ot stock, Stockowner” and his brethren
lave themselves to thank if the facilities on
the routes are not up to standard.

“Canar” : “Carysfort” denies that the error
in compounding a prescription which resulted
in a recent Sydney fatality can fairly be
ascribed to the present archaic system of
pharmaceutical symbols (B. 13/5/’26). The
ruct rcraains that 'the signs for a minim and
a halt of the liquid preparation of the hydro-
chloride of morphine were mistaken for the
signs for 30 minims, the first of the two
symbols for a half being written in a way that
caused it to be confused with the figure three.
Of course, no experienced dispenser would
have made up a mixture with such a huge
dose of morphine in it, but there would have
been less chance of a mistake with the metric
system. I have known a two-drachm dose
to be mistaken for a two-ounce one, the
ounce sign closely resembling the drachm
sign. To say that Latin is used in prescrip-
tions because a ’scrip so written can be dis-
pensed in any country is to ignore that the
constituents of, say, a German prescription
mostly bear names different from those borne
by the same drugs in a French or English
one. And, despite “Carysfort’s” defence
ot Roman figures, doubts as to what a pro-
seriber has intended to indicate by them are
of daily occurrence. Less than an hour ago
I was shown a prescription in which the
*■” ?, f a 10-minim dose looked exactly like
a v ; yesterday I saw one where a “v”
cduld easily have been mistaken for an “x.”
I have dispensed thousands of prescriptions,
and found that scores of them contained pit-
falls for the unwary. In every instance the
trouble was due to the use of the present
system of symbols and figures.

"Foreign Devil” : Another “accident” has
happened to interfere with the peace of
Prince Kon Yi, of Korea, whose marriage
to a Japanese princess of the blood was sup-
posed to cement the union between' Japan and
Korea, but has never been viewed with any
enthusiasm by the Korean people. Kon Yi
was' taken to Tokio when he was 13, and the
marriage was then arranged; but on the eve
of its celebration his father, the Korean
emperor, died suddenly, apparently by sui-
cide—Koreans said that, as a patriot, lie had
sacrificed himself to stop the marriage, which
in the circumstances couldn’t, according to
Korean custom, be celebrated for three years.
Japanese mourning, however, lasts only a
year, and at the end of that time the mar-
riage took place. A child was born, and it was
carried, with its parents, to Seoul, where
it was anticipated that the populace would
greet the human symbol of the Jap-Korean
unity with loud cheers. Every precaution
was taken to make the welcome enthusiastic,
but the people were sullen; and when the
infant died suddenly it was hinted that its
death was the work of patriots determined
to remove what might in future be regarded
as a link with Japan. Recently it was
arranged, in order that the grieving parents
might have an infant born where it wouldn’t
meet sudden death, that the Prince and
Princess should make a world tour. Just as
it was about to begin the Prince’s eldest
brother, the nominal Korean Emperor, whose
heir the Prince is, died at Seoul —also sud-
denly. That means that the proposed trip
must be postponed for a year; and the Japs
show what they think of recent events by
heavily strengthening the guard upon the
Princess, who is now (nominally) the
Empress of Korea. Korea shares the in-
scrutability of “the East,” but it is pretty
cert : n that its real pacification has not yet
even begun.

POLITICAL
POINTS.
Maoriland is proud of the fact that it has
a net surplus of about £4,500,000. It is
always having surpluses, like the Common-
wealth. At the same time it is floating
another loan in London (£6,000,000 this
time), also like the Commonwealth. If some
treasurer could invent a surplus in some
kind of money which would be good to pay
interest with' abroad, people would rise up
and call him blessed —or else say that he
was mad.
James Elder, retiring Australian Commis-
sioner to the U.S., was banqueted in New
York, and he handed over the orthodox butter
on a lordly dish. “Americans,” he said, “are
all friends of Australia. The name Aus-
tralia is an ‘open sesame’ to all hearts.
Unluckily it doesn’t promise to be any kind
of a “sesame” for our wool-tops. When a
paltry consignment of those partly-manu-
factured goods appeared in Sam’s market a
collection of wool-millers spoke rudely at a
different sort of banquet, and declared that
they would get the duty made prohibitive if
the offence was repeated.
The stupefying influence of Canberra
got into Sydney Telegraph’s mind on
a recent Friday, and it published _a
leader about “The End of a Sordid
Chapter.” Its plaint was that, “had
the Federal Convention trusted the people
sufficiently to leave the selection _ of a
capital to the Commonwealth Parliament,
the chances are that the question would have
been settled years ago, and a great deal of
jealousy between the two leading States
obviated.” The conventioners are mostly
dead now, but they were good patriots with
one or two mean exceptions, and don’t
deserve to have that kind of defunct cat
left on their graves. They did leave
the choice of a capital to the Common-
wealth Parliament. It was busy, blundering
George Reid who allowed N.S.W.’s accept-
ance of the Convention to be upset by a
trick, and then induced the State Premiers
to meet and botch the Convention’s work.
Incidentally, in the process he lost Sydney’s
chance of being the Federal capital, but that
was just like Reid.
The Federal Government, besides borrow-
ing externally for itself 25 millions in tie-
past years, has made itself responsible
Expediency is contending with principle
for the determination of Political Labor’s
attitude to the proposed Constitutional
amendments. Principle whispers that the
party has hitherto stood for national con-
trol of trade and commerce and industrial
legislation, and that similar amendments
were submitted by the Fisher Government
in 1911. But expediency points out that
Labor is impotent in the Federal sphere
and likely to remain- impotent till 1931 at
the earliest, whereas it dominates five State
Parliaments, two of which have passed 44-
hour-week bills and olie has raised the basic
wage ss. a week. So it looks as if expedi-
ency will prevail. Labor grows remarkably
like the U.S. Democratic party. It has the
same Tammany infusion, the same bent for
flattering hyphenated elements of tlie popu-
lation,'and is developing the same love for
State Frights.
The Sydney Labor Government didn’t
bother to find out whether McKell had a
nodding acquaintance with the Federal Con-
stitution and the history of his own party
before it sent him to the Melbourne financial
conference. So the young man was in a
place where he could say idiotic things like
these: —
It was the war alone which made it necessary for
the Commonwealth to exploit the field of direct
taxation. He did not think that it was ever intended
bv the framers of the Constitution that the Common-
wealth should enter that field except in the case
of a great national catastrophe.
Whatever the framers of the Constitution
intended or didn’t intend, the Common-
wealth Parliament was given a free hand
as regards the imposition of taxes. More-
over, the field of direct taxation was entered
bv the Federal Labor Government which put
through the Land Tax Assessment Act four
years before the war.
Prime Minister Bruce has announced that
there will be an end of tax-free _ loans
because these “cause hideous inequities be-
tween people with large and small incomes.
While he is about it lie might consider the
hideous inequity of the income-tax without
exception on companies, and also mention
the subject to Lang and other State Pre-
miers. It would be necessary to charge a flat
* rate on that proportion of a company’s
profits which belongs to absentee sharehold-
ers, for they couldn’t be made to contribute
otherwise, but, apart from that, companies
should be exempt, and the shareholders be
individually liable only. When a man (or
an old woman) in N.S.W. has a right to
£3OO of the annual profits of a company,
that being the person’s sole income, it is
robbery to take £52 10s. of the amount in
State and Federal tax, and yet pretend that
there is an exemption for people of small
means.
The muddle which meddling Lang made
in the metal industries came to a character-
istic finish. He put N.S.W. State awards
on a - 44-hours-per-week basis without notic-
ing that he couldn’t do the same with
Federal awards, so the 48-liours men pro-
ceeded to strike against their own awards.
That was when Lang went to Queensland
for rest and quiet. The end was that the
strikers got their reduced working time with
correspondingly reduced pay, which means
one twelfth less pay and one-twelfth more
time to spend it in. They didn’t even win
assurance of a workless Saturday. The re-
duced hours are claimed as a victory by the
restless office busybodies who ran the foolish
strike, but the men are paying a heavy price
so that these people may “save face,’’ or a bit
of face —doubtless the cheek and the jaw.
THE ALLIES.
“There is an unholy alliance between the labor-union bosses and the Freetrade interests to defeat
Australian industries, the one fighting to secure harassing conditions and the othci for such a tarin
as will leave local industry exposed to unfair competition.
The Owners : “It doesn't matter who wins: that’s the that has to be beaten. Jamb

for large outside loans (principal and in-
terest payable in gold) on belialf of the
States. It not only serves out liquor to its
family, but patronises the bottle personally,
and it is acquiring a redness about its own
nose. The fate of a Government which took
measures to pay the foreign interest bill in
coin (its own coin) instead of in lOU s
would probably include the early sack, though
it might return. But it would start a ball
rolling, and it might, after the manner of
Latimer on the frizzle, light a candle which
would take a dashed lot Of blowing out.
It could rely on advertisement, astonishment,
admiration, execration and wild alarm, and
it might snatch a slab of deathless fame amid
the confusion. The supply of deathless fame
is limited, yet some is always available.
In the wrangle over the Federal Govern-
ment’s proposal to withdraw the per capita
payments, one man kept his head among
the shouting of the captains and stood four-
square to his lifelong principles. This was
Vic. Premier Allan, who, when the argument
was at its loudest, started from his slumbers
and suggested that the matter should be
postponed for at least another year. The
somniferous farmer-Premier is sealed beyond
reclaim to putting off till to-morrow the
things that should have been done yesterday.
Trying to flatter John Allan, some of his
friends have been suggesting that he should
appoint himself to the Vic. Water Com-
mission in succession to Dethridge, whose
salary was £1250 a year. Allan is not
biting. To begin with, lie is not eligible. No
member of Parliament can accept an office
of profit under the Crown (except a Sup-
reme Court Judgeship or the Agent-General-
ship) till he has been out of the Legislature
for six months ; and a shrewd head like Allan
would not chance a hand-to-mouth Ministry
keeping a £1250 job warm for him for a half
year. Bent was the only Premier who could
be relied upon to nurse a billet for a politi-
cal friend in that way. He offered to
“store” a County Court Judgeship for the
late J. E. Mackey (afterwards Speaker) if
he cared to earn it by becoming a private
citizen for six months, but, to his own
great disadvantage, Mackey preferred poli-
tics.
Interviewed by a Sydney paper, Mrs. Jock
Garden, the wife of the Trades Hall secre-
tary and chief yeller for the 40-hour (or
less) week, said that “Jock comes home only
to bed and breakfast.” So it looks as though
at his job Jock works anything up to 100
hours a week. It is time somebody explained
what jobs a man may work so hard at that
he can be home only for bed and breakfast.
No doubt Jock will explain that he is work-
ing for his fellow-man, but many a man
who wants to work 48 hours or more wants
to do it for his fellow-woman and his young-
sters, not to mention his fellow-citizens and
the nation. This nation is in greater need
of salvation than Jock’s trade-union cobbers
are just now.
The lack of co-ordination between the
various bodies charged with public services
in Sydney is disgraceful. Directly the Syd-
ney City Council had finished reblocking
Ilay-sfreet, the tramway people tore up the
blocks again in order to lay down a new
tramline; and the completion of a pavement
in any suburb is an almost certain sign that
the Water and Sewerage Board or the
P.M.G.’s telephone branch or the City Coun-
cil’s electric-light excavators will attack it
within a few weeks. The chaos means not
only a pitiful waste but a botched job when
the last workman has left it. But it all
“gives work.” and apparently nothing matters
half so much as that.
,\ preliminary conference on disarmament
met recently at Geneva to devise a scheme
for the general conference to follow. Forth-
with it made history by resolving .“to base
the limitation of armaments on the potential
power of nations to arm.” The meaning
seems to be that no nation shall go about
with more weapons than its people are able
to carry. Yet, considering the risks of sur-
prise attacks from without and of Bol-
shevism fomented within, some States doubt
if even these are enough.
New tramway lines are to be run along
College-street, connecting Park and Oxford
streets; along Bent-street, to make a loop
between the lines in Phillip and Bligh streets;
and along Alfred-street. _ Every lane in Syd-
ney will shortly have itS‘ tramline in the
desperate struggle with the problem of an
octopus city. In. the first quarter of this
year the trams ran an extra 50,602 miles
and carried 247,486 fewer - passengers than
during the same fraction of the previous
year; and although the gross earnings in-
creased by £3683, expenditure increased by
£33,279. It was with a desperate idea that
something had to be done that the Govern-
ment made its- proposal-to massacre private
’bus-owners; but it has deliberately added
to the problem it sought to solve by its liours-
cutting legislation.
Clapp’s cure for the level-crossing slaugh-
ter in Victoria is twofold. Country engines
are to be fitted with powerful headlights
which, on a flat stretch, will be visible 19
miles away and should give motorists time
to pull up, unless they mistake them tor
comets. Then there is to be a law making
it compulsory for drivers of vehicles to stop
before crossing. Who is to see that they do
stop isn’t yet divulged.
The shaving-brush from some insanitary
factory in Asia came in for more notoriety
in Vic. when a hawker was admitted to a
hospital with anthrax, apparently acquired
by shaving himself with one of his own
brushes —he was selling the rest to unsus-
pecting suburbanites. He had bought them
from a city firm cheap. The Federal Gov-
ernment has now made the blinding discovery
that it isn’t sure whether there is a law
restraining bowelless merchants from stamp-
ing “Made in Britain” on brushes from
anthrax-infected Asia and vending them.
While Labor members in the House of
Reps, were attacking the Government be-
cause it refused to accept a resolution which
would give every lead-swinger pension rights
—they wanted to push a good principle too
f ar —Lambert, of West Sydney, characteristi-
cally interjected that “the men who died on
Gallipoli were well paid.” Lambert is rather
representative of Labor’s misfortunes than ot
Labor, but it would be well if the decent
members of the party sat on him occasion-
ally. Lambert didn’t go to the war, and the
gibe that men who did and died were well
paid at 6s. a day comes particularly badly
from a man drawing £lOOO a year tor being
the sort of M.P. that Lambert is.
State Frighters were delighted at the spec-
tacle of McKell, deputy for Lang (N.SAV.),
Vllan (Vic.),' McCormack (Q.), Gunn
(SA.), Collier (W.A.) and Lyons (Las.)
putting their heads together and spurning
Bruce’s proposal that the States should swap
rhe capitation grant, to which they are not
entitled, for the Commonwealth income-tax
on individuals. Party
was forgotten in face
of what was regarded
as a common danger.
Edmund Burke _ said
that calamity is a
great leveller, and,
seemingly, Vic.’s Nat.
Cocky trinity (Allan,
Peacock and Eggles-
ton) found themselves
comfortable enough on
the Labor raft,
although there was a
stage at which Allan
and Eggleston looked
as if they would like
to test the swimming-
bladders Bruce offered.
If Bruce now snaps
his fingers at the
States, the Frighters
will do fearsome
things, or say they
will. Barwcll is said
to be ready to lead a band of mutineers m
the Senate. It would be a joyous thing to
see Barwell and Gunn on the same side.
Queensland’s Preference League is doing
good work. Speakers blow into a factory at
midday and urge the wage-earners to buy
Ipswich flannel and so on, and a preference
badge is on sale. Nearly one hundred papers
are shouting the propaganda, and the Gov-
ernment has given a grant to augment what
manufacturers put in.
The triumph of Zaghlul Pasha at the
Egyptian elections is another drop of trouble
in Britain’s brimming cup. Complete inde-
pendence is the aim of this tarbooshed Mahdi
and his followers, and. like their exemplars
of the Soudan, in attempting to bring it
about they are pressing forward* to another
—and this time a political—Omdurman. The
independent status granted to Egypt after
the war barely survived the double calamity
of rule by Zaglilul. a fellah of the fellaheen,
and that" typical Egyptian aristocrat King
Fuad. A further experience of Zaghlul will
result in a return to the old Protectorate
system, under which Egypt rose in 40 years
from a nation of slaves and taskmasters to
a community of prosperous peasant pro-
prietors and traders, with a top-dressing of
wealthy landowners; but much bother will
intervene.

This Adelaide-controlled show has groaned
under the tronbVes which have afflicted most
timber cos. in the past three years, plus a
few of its own*. Registered in 1909, the
co. worked a rich timber area in southern
Queensland, amd won a golden harvest from
War Service Homes contracts. These latter
took almost all the 1921 output; for that year
divs. were 25 lp.c. on prefs. and 20 p.c. on
ordinaries. (PVefs. are 5 p.c. cumulative,
but come in with ordst. for surplus profits.
They have priority rights as to capital and
share also in surplus assets.) When profits
were made they were branded out freely, which
explains in part the poor look of the past
three years. In Augmst, 1922, cutting rights
over a big Crown area expired, and five
months later saw tine end of the War Ser-
vice Homes contraiet;. According to general
belief, it is possible in timber-milling to cal-
culate pretty closely the amount of work
in a given area, which, market fluctuations
apart, arms a management with knowledge
which should insune shareholders against
nasty surprises; but this hasn’t been notice-
able in the case of Queensland Pine, so far,
anyway, as the original area is concerned.
In a later venture, «on which the co. is now
concentrating, more complex conditions pre-
vail. Development, of an area at Stroud
(N.S.W.), including the construction of a
light railway to Port Stephens, was com-
menced in 19123. By the end of 1924 the
mill and tramway were working, but it was
not till last year that full production was
reached. The proposition has not come uu
to expectations. Profits were expected to
accrue from 1924 output, but “considerable
additional alterfations” had to be made to
the mill, and exes, weue much heavier than
were figured oil Cosfis have gone up and
prices down, cottnpetitkm is keen, and the
harassed directors are now giving “full con-
sideration” to a report made by a Gipps-
land miller. The co. here has a freehold of
8900 acres, and cutting rights over 16 052
acres of Government lands. In 1924 Yarra-
man (Q.) mill proved unprofitable owing
to the usual cause, insufficient logs. The
mill and plant were sold at a loss of £6466
it stood in the booLs at the preceding balance
at £10,447. That blow may, however, be
lightened somewhat fif the co. gets good Drices
for its freehold, which is to be auctioned
shortly.
Chief activity now is at the Stroud area,
and last year s result was unpromising.
Although production was such that sales in-
creased from £20,990 to £43,006, a trading
loss of £3103 was sh own. But £12,286 was
written off for depreciation; so, allowing
for £254 reduction of goodwill (and includ-
ing the £735 for thge prefs.—declared, but,
like its immediate predecessor, unpaid) the
loss was really £15,3190. The cos.’s accumu-
lated debit at p. and 1. swells to £21,513
? h H h 100 it . em of £2284 increases
the £20,<9( of the introductory table. The
adverse result showed also in the financial
position, liabilities being largely in excess

Of total tangibles of £144,773, the Stroud
venture accounts for £127,943. The direc-
tors aren’t easy over prospects. Certainly
there have been a number of unfavorable
factors: higher costs, lower prices bad
weather, etc. “Strenuous efforts” were made
last year, without visible success- but it is
hoped this year, in view of the expert’s
report, that costs will be cut. although the
44-hour week won’t help. Pref share-
holders have two years’ divs. to collect. As
there are only 23,519 of them paid to 12s.
6d., they don’t present a staggering problem
if the board can get the co. on to a profit-
earning basis. The 110,879 fully-paid fl
ords. are a different proposition : they have
a wait ahead of them ; and it may be long
and weary.

Live management is pushing McDowells’
ahead. For years the co. ran its business in
leasehold premises, but the hunger of
property-owners and the competition in retail
softgoods forced the co. to seek a permanent
home in' the very busy neighborhood where
it has had its sign up for so long. Shortly
after the close of the 1925 accounts share-
holders were offered one ordinary at par for
each pref. or ord. held—BB,3o9. Actually
100,894 were issued ; so capital at February 28
reached £181,913 in 10,000 prefs. and 179,203
0rd5.(£7290 unpaid). The new money enabled
the board to buy the old-established business
of W. T. Waters, together with its King-
street freehold and a leasehold with 40 years
to run. The George-street property in
which McDowells’ have been since they
started was also purchased. The net result
of these big changes is that freeholds and
leaseholds with investments (mostly the
former, of course) figure at £177,422 and
mortgages at £62,500. As the two properties
abut, the co. now possesses a site of excep-
tional value for its purposes.
Balance-sheet figures stand as follows:—
1923. 1924. 1925. 1926.
Mortgages £62,500
Sundry creditors £9,243 £6,955 £456 9,347

Cash, etc. .. 2,402 13,135 14,754 34,854
There is only £9347 of floating debt, so the
financial position is snug enough. How much
of the composite item referred to just now
consists of investments the directors don’t
say; but it makes an untidy heap. With
so much of its capital sunk in bricks and
mortar the co. will not have such a free pas-
sage as in the past; but the purchase of
premises is practically forced on metropoli-
tan retailers once they attain size and acnuire
a goodwill, and it depends then on manage-
ment to offset the relative disadvantage. In
this case last year’s result speaks loudly of good
buying and quick turnover, for notwithstand-
ing the retarding influence of re-arrangement
of departments and structural alterations the
greatly increased capital was given 12| p.c.
for the time it was in the co.’s hands (prefs.
get 8 p.c.) and a comfortable sum was sent
to reserves. The profit was equal to 121
p.c. on the full amount of present ordinary
capital after providing for the prefs. That,
of course, isn’t enough to pay 12J p.c. on;
but the directors report “a wonderful ex-
pansion in business since the close of the
accounts” as a result of the additions and
the reorganisation, and if that doesn’t mean
124 p.c. (it probably shouldn’t) it looks
good for a very comfortable 10 p.c.

It was a wise move to double the nominal
at the peak Point in wool; of the
100,000 new shares created last year, 73,662
were taken up “at practically no cost to the
company.” Apart from the £18,362 received
(the shares are called to ss. only) the issue
n S % num ber of new clients to the co., for
the Country Producers is semi-co-operative.
Let the management has been able to treat
shareholders, as such, quite decently—last
year slO p.c. was the fifth of its line. Up
to 12 months ago the maximum holding of
shares was 200; it is now 1000, and with
good management producing good results the
dividend aspect is not likely to be overlooked
by clients. The refunds of commissions made
to consignors were on the usual scale: 30
p.c. on wool and 15 p.c. on produce and
stock.
A record quantity of wool was sold and
cattle were about recent average, but sheep,
although almost twice as many were handled
as in the previous year, were still under
earlier figures. The greater wool business
influenced gross earnings, which established
a record. These figures stretch back to the
co. s first year:—
Wool Gross

1926 .. 48,403 200,519 18,068 62,903
Lower prices ruling for most lines were more
than counterbalanced by volume handled.
Expenses were kept well in hand: gross re-
venue, less commission refunds, showed a
gain oyer the previous year’s £10,960, but
outgo increased by only £6157. That was
very good, and if it can be approximated in
the future the outlook for both clients and
shareholders—the latter are chiefly the
former—is rosy. The fact that the co. con-
fines its advances to wool and stock means
that it has less risks than the ordinary pas-
toral-finance houses, and the board intends
to keep to the field in which it at present
operates. The position at March 31 was
better than at the previous balance. A wool
sale just before the close of accounts in-
flated both debtors and creditors, yet the
latter were actually less than they were a
year earlier: £53,825 compared with £58,847.
The mortgage on the co.’s new store also
was £6331 less (£55,092). Book debts were
£114.452 as against £89.284. A holding of
£2OOO in Commonwealth stock has dis-
appeared. The co.’s land and buildings are
in at £93,302. The expansion of liabilities
ana debtors because of the wool sale just
prior to the close of the accounts makes an
exact analysis impossible, but it is obvious
that the improvement was quite creditable.
The co. is not likely to lose the new busi-
ness attracted last term so long as the man-
agement maintains its ptesent efficiency; and
consistent attention to reserves will ease the
stress of the harsh times which lie some-
where ahead.

That improved div. was based, of course, on
the fat earnings which were skimmed from
the remarkable prosperity of the opening
months of the term. Yet even 12J p.c. isn’t
anything to enthuse over considering the size
of reserves: after payment of the final div.
these amounted to £310,700—£60,700 in
excess of paid capital. The return to' share-
holders shrinks still further in view of the
additional fact that the ’co. had the use of
cheap debenture capital to the, amount of
£761,965 (£780,030 at September 30, 1924).
The co, has built very conservatively, how-
ever, and this list of assets explains in part
the small return on total funds:—
\ Public securities, etc. .. .. £275,327
Premises, plant, etc. ~ .. 84’046

Mortgages, foreclosures, etc. .. 864,391
Advances on wool and produce .. 33,596
Sundry debtors .. , . ... 422,236
Cash .. .. 4,848
The co. seems to be getting a poor return from
other things besides the gilt-edged stock.
It is possible, of course, that it is
providing against contingencies with both
hands. That would certainly be wise,
for prices for most classes of land have
been pushed to ridiculous heights in M.L.
of recent years, largely because “purchasers”
have been let in with hardly any capital to
speak of, and those who bought or added
to their old areas at the peak will prove a
problem to the financing cos. if nature or the
London moneylenders smack the Rickety
Isles. The assumption that the co. is doing
better than the figures suggest is supported
somewhat by the fact that the directors have
voted £6689 in the past two years to the
superannuation fund —the first visible appro-
priations for many years. Expenditure is
creeping up again, but taxation has been
lighter: the English corporation profits tax
has gone, which must have lightened last
year’s figure, and M.L. taxation was £9205
compared with £15,421 for the previous year.
Here is a four-years’ comparison:—

the risks attached to capital invested in the
country mortgage business, their return

the spring were unfavorable and a poorer

ported, Maonland’s known capacity to make

Again a shrinkage in profits; and again the
cause is a smaller return from the co.’s
holding in General Films. Erratic divs. from
that quarter have been the chief cause of
the m-and-out behavior of profits. Still
there was enough to enable this co. do pay
10 p.c., and as the average since the recon-
struction of the old West’s Pictures Ltd
in 1913 lias been 9§ p.c. shareholders have
been decently treated. In addition £28,468
has been accumulated, although only £219
was added last year. There is a “capital
reserve’’ of £37,888, which represents the
amount by which the co. discounted the face
Films holding, but that is ex-
cluded. Ihe co.’s own theatres appear to
be consistent in earnings, judging by the re-
ports, and should, indeed, show improvement.

Balance-sheet figures showed little change,
chief being an increase in the cash holding
to £1482. Of total assets of £33,902, £28,750
was in public securities and cash; £1450
loans on mortgage; £2163 advances to
estates, etc.; and £1532 in interest accrued
and fittings, etc. In the previous accounts,
furniture and fittings were in at £5BO, writ-
ten down from £BB2. Shareholders are m a
good position, and expanding business may
win them a plum or two later on. Clients
are protected by £31,725 of funds phis

The Wild Cat Monthly, to be published
next Saturday (June 5), contains informa-
tion of much value to investors for which it
is impossible to find space in these weekly
two pages. Originally the _ Monthly was
mainly a reprint of the “Wild Cat's” finan-
cial reviews; gradually it has gone far be-
yond that, and now, for example, lists prac-
tically every stock dealt' in on Australian
Exchanges, giving their present prices, the
dividends the cos. paid last year and for the
past three years, the return on an invest-
ment, and much other detail. Prospectuses
are dissected—among those in the current
number is the attractive debenture issue by
the Davis Gelatine Co. The idea behind the
Monthly is to give the investor, big and
little, all the trustworthy information that
can be gathered to assist him in lus choice
of stocks and shares —in short, to help him
to avoid dealing in haste and repenting at
leisure.

Motor Parking Stations, Ltd., is Sydney
Parking Station in a new dress. The earlier
proposition was withdrawn when strikes
and the Federal elections dislocated things.
The co. proposes to make a chain of parking-
stations and -garages, and, as a first step, to
buy R. C. Clark’s option over the Golds-
brougli, Mort building at Circular Quay tor
conversion into a stable capable of housing
935 cars. The premises are very substantial
and the situation good.. The idea is to have
shops on the street level and a restaurant
and dance palais on the roof. The purchase
price of the building is £lBO,OO0 —deposit
£25,000 ; annual payments of £5000; balance
at 15 years. Capital is £500,000 in £1
shares, of which 75,000 10 p.c. cum. prefs. are
offered; 150,000 ordinary shares on easy
terms of payment; 125,000 prefs. and 130,000
ordinaries reserved. But new prefs. beyond
the present issue may be put out only
under certain conditions. The promoter,
Roland Clark, is to receive £27,625 in cash
for his option and other services, of which
he is to devote £20,000 to the cash purchase
of fully-paid ords. Already 100,000 ords.
and 50,000 prefs. have been underwritten
on which the co. pays brokerage only. Total
capital outlay inclusive of interest is esti-
mated at £365.232, the first year’s require-
ments being £215,232. E. S. Wolfenden has
investigated the financial side, and other
aspects are reported on by experts. The
authorities are unlikely to permit street
parking to continue, owing to increasing con-
gestion. The property will always possess
a great value, and increment should be
steady. The Wild Cat, therefore, reaffirms
its previous opinion that the scheme is well
worth attention.

Renewed interest in the production of oil
from shale raises the question as to the advi-
sability of extending the bounty to oil derived
from coal. Evolution of low-temperature re-
torting Methods applied to coals, both black
and brown, in the United States and Europe
has reached the stage where commercial re-
sults can be shortly exnected. Especially
attractive are the high-volatile, low-ash, pure
coals of the N.S.W. measures; but hitherto
the difficulties in finding markets for coke
residuals has seriously retarded schemes for
coal-oil production.

George Weir, the man whose great faith,
backed by a few other virtues, has moved
mountains at the Broken Hill North, will
leave the general manager’s chair at the
end of the year; it is some consolation to
know that his faith has brought wealth to
himself as well as to others. On his recom-
mendation the very capable C. J. Emery will
succeed him, with W. C. Gall as mine
superintendent. Emery, whose title will, it
is understood, be “general superintendent,”
has graduated from a clerk’s stool; Gall,
who will be mines superintendent, is a highly-
trained technical man, to whom, as to the
retiring general manager, the North mine
is the world. Emery is a diplomat above
all things; though his front name is iCyril
he can referee a miners pnze-fight and do
a hundred other things that make him
“good cove” to even the reddest Keds^
Wiluna Gold Corporation had an enthusi-
astic roll-up in London the other day.
man Hamilton said that the co. held sub
stantially all the shares i>' a local coneerii
which was opening up the \V lluna m -
its behalf, and .he summarised, wy briefly
the “weighty evidence that led him to P -
that Wiluna would develop in the next yeai
or two into a very large gold producer, i ay
able lodes over 40ft. in width were men-
tioned. and the fact was noted that assays
made by Government officials were hi o ni.
than those announced by the company.
Finally the following opinion of general-
manager Vail, whose caution is noted, was
quoted: “The property presents an pppor-
tunity to provide an output in tonnage equa
to the combined mines of Ivalgoorlie, with
the advantage of one management, one treat-
ment plant, and one of everything which at
Ivalgoorlie is of necessity multiplied a num-
ber of times.... I confidently expect the
Wiluna mine will for many years rank with
the largest gold producers in the world, and
by the use of modern and labor-saving machi-
nery we will be able to treat ore at a profit
which would not pay working expenses under
the conditions operating at Kalgoorlie.

Brilliant Co. (W.A.) recently took The
Bulletin's advice and got a couple of reli-
able men to look at its show. These two
experts have since reported that the man-
agement is now efficient, that prospects arc
not bad, and that profits should be made m
the future. With a view of increasing these
profits certain recommendations have been
made in respect to development work and
plant. #
Collie coalfield (W.A.) plods along. Last
year’s output was 437,561 tons valued at
£363,201, and to get this 675 men were
employed. Five mines were worked, and all
the coal was machine-won. The field’s pro-
ducing capacity could be expanded consider-
ably, but at present the demand doesn t war-
rant any move in this direction.

Bill Hedges, boss of many things in the
West and ex-M.H.R., is about to build a
100-mile private line from Meekatharra to
the manganese deposits owned by a local
eo. of which he is chairman. The co. will
need a quarter of a million to complete this
work and reach the productive stage, and so
far paid capital falls considerably short of
that. As there is bound to be a long wait
for profits, the co. may find some difficulty in
getting the balance in; but it has good back-
ing, and the energy of the promoter will
mean something.

The old, old story. Two test crushings
from the disappointing Ives’ Reward ( vv .A.)
proved unpayable. Then “the employees
milled ore for themselves and did well. 1 In-
board declared it could not account for the
difference in results, and then, with a feel-
ing that something drastic must be done to
appease shareholders, it got rid of all hands
and is now seeking the approval of the State
Government, which is the biggest creditor,
to let the mine on tribute. As this might
mean picking the eyes out of the best ot
what is left the Government will be green
if it consents.

The Lawler shaft, Mt. Isa, from which the
Rio Grande lode is being tested at a depth
of 200 ft., struck heavy water before enter-
ing the sulphides. The significance of the
values in this crosscut is increased by the
fact that the ore is dense sulphide, although
zinc values have not yet been given. The
first six feet, averaging 16 per cent, lead
and 19oz. silver, is high grade, and as all
sulphides so far have been high ill zinc, it is
pretty sure that this metal will increase the
value of the ore. The Grande at 100 ft.
depth showed 35ft. of carbonate worth 12
pc lead. It is not likely that it will be
much different in size at _ 200 ft... but the
next week or two will elucidate that point.
Anything like 30ft. of sulphide ore of the
grade of the first Oft. of the crosscut will
make the Grande one of the plums of the
field. But values almost everywhere on the
field have been higher below water-level than
in the carbonate ore. Information regarding
core values in the Black Star bore should
be available shortly, and certainly not before
they are due.

Randolph Bedford writes :
“Long Tom’s” pathetic objection to my statement
that the Isa Board “has shown its sense of proportion
by giving away blocks of shares for leases which
by-and-bye it could have had for nothing” pre-
supposes that I alluded to outcrop leases. His
attempt to interpret my meaning as “these working-
men leaseholders will never be able to finance full
development of their leases” is merely impudent.
The leases I alluded to were “deeps” and “deep
deeps” with no hope of ore until 700 ft. in to
ease of the deeps and 1500 ft. in the case of tie
deep deeps. The holders of these leases were neither
working men nor prospectors —they were pig mei-
ehants. And the ridiculous price of £65,000 for
the Isa South—five chains of outcrop, two deeps and
two foot wall leases —was paid neither to “working-
men leaseholders” nor to “old-time prospect oi s.

Stannary Hills (N.Q.), which was a
thriving tin centre a few years hack, is icel-
ing very sick as a result of the failure ot
the Arbouin. This was a low-grade show,
but one of the biggest producers in N.Q.
The co. has dismantled its 30-head mill tor
sale, and as the Derek Co.’s plant has also
gone there are no local crushing facilities.
However, there are not many tin-prospectors
in the district. The Lass o’ Cowrie, the
rich show of Derek's, has been re-opened
in a small way, but no tin of any conse-
quence is being won. The ore has become
arsenical, so concentrates from there will not
he in demand. As all this has happened
while tin has been at the peak it is likely
that the shutters are up for good at the Hills
except for prospecting parties' parcels ot
concentrates.

The Great Northern stopes, Herberton
(N.Q'.), are looking well both overhead and
under the 300 ft. line. Sinking will shortly
be resumed below this level on the ore shoot.
The co. has just cleaned up 204 tons for
over 22 tons of concentrates, value approxi-
mately £3iuo.

Ravens wood Gold Mines (N.Q.) continues
to produce small tonnages of prill ore. What
it lacks in quantity is made up in quality,
for values in the Duke shoot frequently
touch 20oz. Actual returns are hard to locate
as slimes, concentrates and prill are seut
away for treatment. The reef in the
is averaging about 6 inches. No. 5 South s
11 inch of ore makes poor reading m that
direction; but a new make in No. 6 North
is a bright ray in a poor patch, ine co.
is sticking to the hanging-wall reef m No
level, which promises well. The reef there
consists of 6 inches of heavy mineralized
ore. The last consignment from the mine
included 67 tons of concentrates for Lurope.

The Castle Dredging Co., Kangaroo Hills
field (N.Q.), is sluicing; a recent run
while water was available gave o tons

residues were included in this lot values
are expected to be higher next run.

“In the open cut two men bored and fired
four tons of stone containing two tons o
55 p.c. to 60 p.c. antimony ore, reports H.
I. Jensen in his latest bulletin from the
(Queensland Antimony Co.’s lease at North-
cote (N.Q.). He added that a Mines Depart-
ment inspector was present. Atop °t a
this Jensen wired the Sydney office tor
approval to increase the mine team by 2 ,
and this was granted. In the No. .1 shaft
of the Black Bess lease specimens of free
gold varv from soz. to 10oz., and in Black
Bess No! 3 shaft 6in. of the lode is so rich
as not to require picking. The co. easily
got in its first £2OOO. on the new issue ot
90 000 4s shares, and will have a similar
wad to gather in eight weeks’ time. Mean-
while, though, if production corroborates Jen-
sen’s reports, the co. should be on the divi-
dend list. The market which had gone
beyond 10s. for the shilling paids did not
hold to the full ex-rights, but, although the
price slipped back, there was no collapse.
Old hands who would have nothing to do
with the float are puzzled. They know Dr.
Jensen’s reputation for seeing swans in
geese; but that doesn't alter the fact that
he may find a real swan some day.
Northern Territory Mining, N.L., one of
Arthur Clarke’s propositions launched at
Cairns (Q.), becomes Marranboy Tin Mine,
N.L. It lias been decided to exercise the
option over the Marranboy. the consideration
being £2OOO cash and £4OOO m fully-paids.
First payment of £5OO is to be made on
July 8, and thereafter £5OO half-yearly. The
properties comprise the Marranboy an | th«

goes with the mines. N.T. shares are con-
verted into 5220 £1 shares in the new co.
and a further 5220 (payable 6d. each appli-
cation and allotment) are being offered to
shareholders. The show is being worked
open-cut. Ore from development went 14
p.c., which is said to show .a small
2 P.c. is expected in the crushing being put
through when the mail left, and average
values of 3 p.c. are expected when the richer
portions of the mine are opened up. On an
estimate of 2 p.c. ore, the co. sees profits
in the proposition. Already cartage charges
have been reduced by the use of tractois.
The old Eureka was abandoned at the sul-
phides, but Walter Colley reports that the
ore is easily treated by present-day methods.

Mandated Development, Matapau, got oil
at 475 ft. in No. 6 bore. It was no gusher,
but about 10 gallons an hour oozed out ot
the sandy shale. The Bm. casing m No. 6
hole will permit of greater depth being
reached than in the other bores which were
found impossible beyond about bbutt.
10-barrel sample of the Matapau oil, gathered
from the other bores, arrived at the bydnty
office by the Mataram last week.

ponement of production, bucked from 455. to

lease, and believes that the end of August
should see tin oxide—but about 300 tons ot
that is already mortgaged by the growing

ends of poles, as in Japan ; clerks counting
wheatbags on the abacus, as in China; men
scratching their fields with the plough of
wood sharpened at one end which is depicted
on the bas-reliefs of Egypt. We drew up at
a siding with an unpronounceable name, to
let some freighted trucks shrouded in canvas
go by. One of the coverings was torn, the
wind blew it aside, and I read, in a dazzle
of red and yellow paint, the word “Aus-
tralia.” 1 rubbed my eyes; but there was
no doubt about it. Those farm implements
were the visible sign of tin* greatest adven-
ture Australian industry ever engaged in.
Here was the newest land selling manufac-
tures to one of the oldest, and the thing was
a whole lesson in racial differences. A fort-
night later the War killed the' enterprise
which Sam McKay, a brother of H.V., had
initiated as the result of a visit to Russia
two years before. The other day I visited
Sunshine, outside Melbourne, and it was still
flourishing. In Russia, I hear, the moujik,
in his new-found freedom, has gone back to
the wooden plough, and while he sits around
the fire through the long Arctic winter the
village storyteller recounts how in days ot
the giants a painted bird of steel and wire
used to fly from the far Southland and eat
up the peasant’s crops in a single night.

“X D.”: Death played one ghastly trick in
the Caulfield train smash. Young George
Beames was among those hurled forward, but
whilst others in the compartment were
thrown to the floor he was killed by jagged
beams from the telescoped carriage, and
thrown back into his seat again. There,
when the rescuers came, he was found sitting
with the book he had been reading open on
his knees and his head bowed over it, as if
he was still interested. The only difference
was that his body had slouched to one side
and jambed an injured girl against the wreck-
age of the window. She kept looking at tin 1
ghastly thing that was pinning her down,
and screamed until she fainted.

“Erua” : During the war a Maoriland nurse
on leave was visiting relatives on the west
coast of Scotland, and it was her custom to
bathe each morning in a small cove just
below the house. Going down to the water
one morning she noticed a calico-covered
parcel in the tide, and waded in to retrieve
it. The parcel was addressed in her mother's
writing to a brother in France, and was
the first intimation the girl had that some-
thing had happened to a vessel carrying
Maoriland mails. Although further inquiry
was made this was apparently the only parcel
to travel as far up.

“Q.G.S.” : I saw some Melbourne bailiffs
trying to seize a flivver whose fair driver
determinedly stood—or sat —upon the orde’-
of her going. The resistance she opposed
was entirely passive, but after many minutes
of unsuccessful argument the bailiffs retired.
Presently they returned with, another car,
hitched a cable to the axle, and, amid the
cheers of the crowd, towed the captive
merrily down Queen-street. The cheers re-
doubled when its occupant suddenly gave
the wheel a turn or two and jambed on the
brakes, swinging the bailiffs’ car into the
gutter. The conflict started during lunch-
time at Little Collins-street, and I unfor-
tunately missed the next two or three hours
of it. But passing down Queen-street late in
the afternoon I found myself in at the death,
so to speak. The captured flivver was now
opposite “the Lane.” But the lady still re-
mained at her post, like a feminine Casa-
bianca.

in the Stockade by Trooper
King, it was placed in the

afterwards stolen. Nowa-

always worked upon the
office or factory lady-killer
who, when, he arrived, was
given a message to ring up
a Paddington number (the
Zoo was at Moore Park in
those days) and ask for
“Jessie.” With pride in his
new conquest he would set
the 'phone in action, only to
be treated to some biting
sarcasms from the Zoological
Garden’s officials, to whom
die joke, as it spread, became a nuisance.

“Retired Volt" : Talk about coincidences!
Nowadays London ‘■‘prefixes” its cables to
all parts of the world. Thus a message pre-
fixed “JR” goes direct to Shanghai, while an
“AO” gofes forthwith to Sydney. London
wrongly prefixed a wire to India and it
turned up in Maoriland. When the head
office discovered its mistake it ordered the
Dominion to cancel tne message, but M.L.
said it couldn’t, since the message had been
delivered and accepted. After 4S hours of
argument across the globe, the facts were
sorted out. En route the office of destination
had ' got metamorphosed into something
resembling a Maori place-name-. An intelli-
gent p.m. remembered a man of the ad-
dressee's name who owned a sheep station
50 miles away. As the wire said something
about £lOO coming to the recipient it was
accepted with alacrity. It turned out that
the receiver in Maoriland was the brother
of the rightful owner in India, and had
named his 'sheep station after his relative’s
tea estate in Assam.

“P,M.” : M.L. butter factories are behind
the times in their treatment of condemned
cream (B. 20/5/’2G). A regulation in Vic-
toria directs that any cream below the second
grade shall be mixed with kerosene, stirred
and returned to the supplier. As for return-
ing a can with a rat in it, that isn’t always
possible. Unless the rat or mouse, has been
a week dead, he will be at the bottom of
the can, and if you don't: hit him with the
pump when you draw the sample you don’t
see him till the cream is tipped through the
strainer and he rolls out last. When tip-
ping cans in quick succession a rat often gets
into the strainer amid thick cream, and you
can’t identify the can which held him. In
addition to rats, mice, sparrows, frogs and
lizards, I have found various articles in
cream —cups, plates, pannikins, soap, a
bread-knife, a soup-ladle, a bunch of grapes,
half a brick, a piece of clay and innumerable
spoons. A grader in a Gippslanjl factory
recently struck a can of cream which had a
peculiar flavor, though there was no trace
of any" foreign body in it. Unable to diag-
nose the trouble he sent back a second-grade
ticket marked “Foreign flavor.” “By cripes,
that grader’s a shrewd head,” said the cocky
when the driver handed him the ticket next
day; “I just put a newchum Italian on
milkin’ and he smells him right away!”

“Mako”: Wartime meetings? A Maori-

his surname, a very uncommon one, called

first cousins. It was their only meeting,
both being killed the first week, but the two
families have been in touch ever since.

to run a rough survey for subdivision pur-

virgin country belonging to the A. A. Com-
pany at Ward's River (N.S.W.J. The other
day he was asked to locate one particular
peg on his original survey, upon the position
of which depended the right of access to a
road and an outlet for much valuable timber.
Clements started out back from the home-
stead. Six miles out we found all the blazes
gone; floods, too, had silted earth over the
pegs and had washed away the stones ringed
around them. “Well." said the surveyor
reflectively. “30-odd years is a long way to
go back, but unless I’m much mistaken she’s
about here”—and he jabbed his knife into
the grass, cutting a We all looked

“Herodot”: When a person dies in Sydney
nowadays the death announcement is the sig-

the effects of the deceased. Recently a friend
of mine died, and on the day after that on
which the advt. appeared in the S. M.

lobking individual who wanted to purchase
her husband’s wardrobe. Two others fol-
lowed the next day, while by the post she
received several circulars from persons who
offered to buy even his tyoots —at a price.
But the limit was reached by a furtive,
frowsy person who explained that his mis-
sion was to see if the deceased had possessed
a set of false teeth, gold or platinum pre-
ferred. and if they were for sale.

THE NEVER-TO-BE-BEATEN PRINCE.
“The Prince of Wales entered a fashionable dance club, where the band immediately played one of his favorite airs, ‘I Wonder where Baby Is To-night.’ The Prince
insisted on eight encores, whereupon the band determined to tire him out It played continuously for balf an hour, while the Prince danced on merrily. The band finally
gave in breathless.” — Oable.


“TRES BIEN!”
said the Frenchman, positively, after tasting Orlando Port. And when a Frenchman, naturally jealous of his country’s wine
reputation, bestows such emphatic praise—well, the wine must be good.
Further confirmation of its quality was forthcoming at the last Sydney R. A. Show, where G. Gramp & Sons were
awarded special prize for most successful exhibitor, also champion and two firsts for Port.

“Sturt” : The last act of a motoring trag-
edy was entered on last weeek at the Crimi-
nal Court in Adelaide, when a well-known
hotelkeeper surrendered to his bail and was
removed in custody to start 12 months’ im-
prisonment. Driving his motor-car on
December 1, he was mixed up in a fatal
accident; the jury said it was his fault and
inexcusable. The case has been stoutly
fought for him twice more, but neither the
Appeal Court nor the High Court saw
reason to disturb the verdict.
* * * *
“Geoloin” : All of us in the boarding-house
were a little sceptical about Hill’s claims
to be a litterateur in his spare moments;
even when he appeared with a newspaper
clipping and remarked in his star-boarder
manner that this was his latest press con-
tribution I doubt if anyone was convinced.
But when a few days later he produced a
cheque for 255. and mentioned that he had
just received it in payment for that par-
ticular contribution, all our doubts vanished.
Here was evidence that nobody could sneer
at. “If ever I get a cheque for a par,” said
Sim enviously, “I’ll frame it.” Hill, rather
to our surprise, approved the idea, and. dis-
placing the screen beauty from her environ-
ment, inserted the cheque, and hung it over
his dressing-table, with some remark about
the first-fruits of journalism. A few weeks
later Sim and I were stuck for beer-money
two nights before pay-day. “What about
that cheque of Hill’s hanging wasted on the
wall?” said the Tempter, and we fell. It
was no trouble to us to get a blank cheque-
form, and we made such a colorable imita-
tion of Hill’s cheque that you couldn’t have
OURED.
“So he’s given up taking a spot?”
“Yeh. Rolled home once and saw two of his ma-in-law.”
told the difference behind the glass. A few
days later while at work I was told I was
wanted. On going out I saw a very angry
publican and a big John Hop putting the
second degree on Sim; they looked as if
they were saving the third for me. How-
ever, after a lot of qmoodging and explaining
and promising to make good the damage, we
got the publican to listen to reason, and the
.John turned out a good sport. It seemed
that the cheque we had taken out of Hill’s
frame was the same kind as the one we had
replaced it with.
* * * *
“Looey Cans” : The queerest cargo I ever
helped load was a consignment of pilgrims.
We took them aboard at Tjilijap (Java),
bound for Jaffa. Our boat was a tramp of
good class, specially fitted out for the job,
which must have been a highly lucrative side-
line for the owners. To the deck crowd it
had no special appeal; a vast smell of the
East hung over the ship like the curse of
the albatross over the Ancient Mariner. The
bos’n was the only
man who scanned
the pilgrims with
an appreciative eye.
Hadji was easy
loading; he brought
little aboard except
a wild hullabaloo
cf noise and a life-
time of savings,
the latter securely
belted around his
body. A change of
clothes had no at-
traction for him.
The voyagers were
drafted into ’tween
decks, where tiers
of wooden bunks
were rigged, and
the overflow found
parking under the.
awnings on the
well-decks. Soon
we were dipping
into the soft mon-
soon swell on our
long plough n.-w.
Through the days
of steaming heat
many of the pas-
sengers began to
sicken. Those who
died were lowered
over the side at
night, from the
after-end of the
well-deck, and the
extension light,
through the bos’n’s
bulkhead port, was
the means whereby
the friends or rela-
tives were able to
sew the canvas
shroud and super-
vise the interments. For the illumina-
tion “Bose” got a dollar (Singapore) a
throw, and the money was always on the
brief, too.
* * * *
“Verri”: Some of the censors, blessed
with a sense of humor, could not resist an
occasional annotation. One youthful Digger
placed in his letter a long-cherished one-pound
note, asking his sister to buy their mother
a birthday-gift, “if you ever get the money.”
She got the money safely, and read in small
writing on the letter margiii, “It was a great
temptation, but the censor is proud to say
he resisted it!”
* * * *
“Spare Corp.” : I don’t know who had the
shortest term of soldiering (B. 27/5/'26),
but the First Bri-
gade held a man
with only a few
hours’ line service
who proudly car-
ried eight wound-
stripes on his
sleeve. If he
wasn’t hit by some-
thing on his w r ay
into the line, he
always got it be-
fore he had been in
more than five
minutes. The pro-
ne s s became s o
monotonous that
after his eighth in-
jury—a hole in the.
flesh of the arm
which came to him
when still a kilo
from the line—a
charge of “self-
inflicted wounds”
was laid, but no-
thing was proved
against him. The
wounds being all
slight, this Dig-
ger’s army life was
a perpetual holi-
day, and his habit
whilst on convales-
cent leave of mop-
ping up feminine adoration filled with
bitterness cobbers who spent weary months
in the trenches.
“Herodot”: While an expensively-dressed
young man was looking over a tray of highly-
priced diamond rings in a Sydney jeweller’s
shop, the assistant suddenly noticed that one
of the rings was missing. He promptly re-
ported the matter to his bosses, and after
a fruitless search the police were ’phoned for,
the customer being politely but firmly re-
quested to await their arrival. Presently
a couple of'detectives were giving the suspect
his choice between allowing himself to be
searched and accompanying them to the sta-
tion. Muttering protests about the indignity
and a probable action for damages, lie took
the former course. The ’tecs small-combed
him from head to heel in a private room
without any success, and there was no-
thing for it but to let him go, while the firm
wondered whether it had not had something
new worked on it. The suspicion was jus-
JUST SAVED HIM.
“I believe that’s my Billy over there making wild love to your wife.”
“By gee, so it is! If you weren’t here I’d go over and punch the
blighter on the nose.”
tified, but it was not till monfhs later that
the detectives discovered from a communica-
tive member of the underworld how it had
been done. While the assistant’s eye was
wandering for a few seconds, the customer
had stuck the ring with a large piece of
chewing-gum to the under-side of one of the
show-cases, where it was almost inconceiv-
able that anyone would look for it. Some
days later a confederate called in, and in
the course of some pretended business re-
moved the ring from its hiding-place.
* * * *
“F.S.”: I hear that Mr. Clapp is meditat-
ing putting up a new slogan, “Fools become
Angels at Railway Crossings.” I suppose
something must be sacrificed in these days
of speed, but I still have a sneaking affec-
tion for the old days of dignity and leisure
when the following warning used to be
attached to the horse-trams in Paris: “It
is expressly recommended to Messieurs the
travellers, descending, not to abandon
the shelter momentarily provided for them
by the vehicle they have just quitted until
after they have satisfied themselves that no
other vehicle coming in the contrary direc-
tion is in proximity.”
* * * *
“Hamer”: Evidently different tempera-
ments find different reactions in the death-
hour (B. 27/5/’26). Though on three
occasions I have mentally said good-bye to
this good old world, there was never so much
as a streak- of mental anguish caused by the
panorama that rose before me, although
faults and follies of a lifetime were plain
enough amongst the other things. On one
occasion a shell burst almost at my feet;
the man behind me said afterwards —he
thought it a joke—that I remarked quite
calmly, “Well, here’s the finish!” The time
between the burst and my extraordinary sur-
prise at being uninjured could be reckoned in
a fraction of a second ; but the past flashed
according to specifications. Yet the only
“mental anguish” came with the surprise,
followed by an absolutely panicky desire to
avoid the next shell. Perhaps the “death
remorse ” is . a reward to half-finished
sinners who have left so much white on the
canvas of their lives that the black spots
show up horribly.
* * * *
“Magma”: It is quite possible that the
chemical reaction caused by sugar and salt
water should be fatal to various forms of life
in the Port River at Adelaide (B. 22/4/’26).
“X2X” objects that sugar consists of only
carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. He is correct
only as far as pure sugar or sucrose is con-
cerned ; the sugar that was burnt at Glan-
ville refinery was raw sugar, stored on
account of the Queensland Sugar Pool. Be-
sides the above-named elements this also con-
tains potash, lime, magnesia, soda, carbonic
acid, sulphuric acid, salicylic acid, phosphoric
acid and chlorine. The same effects as those
recorded by “Adelaide” in the original par.
can be seen at many of the Queensland sugar
mills.
* * * *
“E;s.” : Tea, mild and all as it is, caused
one of Australia’s earliest industrial troubles.
It was at the end of the (Chinese war of
IS3B that the Orwell, from China, made
Port Jackson, heavily loaded with the green
variety, then new to this country. Squatters
made haste to replenish supplies from the
cargo, but their hands took an intense dis-
like to the color of the staple beverage, many
of them rolled their swags and departed,
vowing that they wouldn’t drink the
stuff. Then somebody circulated a story
that the Chinese had hatched a conspiracy
for the wholesale poisoning of the bar-
barians. Squatters peered anxiously into
each other’s faces, looking for symptoms of
a hasty finish; riders and pedestrians would
be stopped with the query, “Are any of
them dead yet on the next station?” But
the “painted” tea, though noxious to un-
accustomed palates, proved harmless; and
when the hands returned next year, so used
had they become to the Pekoe that another
tea-strike almost threatened when the ordi-
nary vintage was found to be again on tap.
* * * *
“P.M.”: Dummy trees weren’t the only
fakes rigged up in Prance (B. 13/5/’2G).
I knew a flying officer whose hawk-like eyes
discovered a battery of four 12in. guns which
moved ont of cover to fire and then slid back.
He duly reported his find, and the artillery
emptied an enormous quantity of ammuni-
tion into it. After the German retreat we
went up to have a look at the remains. The
battery consisted of four drain-pipes rigged
up on a swivel affair of posts and wires
and covered over with branches.

“C. Bumpkin”: The involuntary feat of
the Duke of Medina Sidonia in 1588 was
emulated by a four-masted barque which
swam into Port Phillip very rusty and GO
days overdue the other morning. Starting
from the Baltic on December 19, she struck
heavy weather in the Bay of Biscay, which,
after stripping her of her clothes, drove her
clean round the British Isles. This was
nothing, however, to the performance of a
sailing-ship that set out from Melbourne for
Bunbury (W.A.) during the war. After

WHEN WINTER SMILES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The breaking dawn is like a mist of gold
When day comes thrusting through the clouds of
night;
The placid air, serene and crisply cold,
Is as a wine of infinite delight;
Gone are the storms; the sun, with dazzling feet,
Dances on dew-wet sward and drying tiles;
Life for its tempests past seems doubly sweet
When winter smiles.
The cheerful chirp of birds is like a shout
Of gladness from an earth that hails the sun
Whose glancing beams, thrown lightly round about,
Through dripping leaves in rainbow joyance run;
The flowers uplift their moisture-laden heads,
The glow of sparkling light is spread for miles;
The world all thoughts of cold oppression sheds
When winter smiles.
How carelessly we spend the days of spring,
Let summer’s wasted hours expend their glow!
When winter brings its gloom, its frosts their sting,
A wan regret for lost delights we know.
Yet though the chill of age benumbs the veins,
Still live some days whose sunny touch beguiles
To warm the spirit with the joy that reigns
When winter smiles.

John William Israel supplies another ex-
ample of the man who, like Dickens's cab-

him from falling down. He continued at
work, although 75 years old, until recently
he was given extended leave as a prelude to
retirement; and now he is dead. Israel's

Commissioner to Uncle Sam's dominions.
contribution to the winning of the war was
•sage financial advice to Commonwealth
Ministers, who learnt to rely upon the
Auditor-General as a wizard of figures. He
started life with the Tasmanian Railways,
arid after being a stationmaster as a mere
youth transferred to the Tasmanian Audit
Office and was Auditor-General at the age
of 45 —remarkable progress in a State in
which, in those days, the man without a
white beard was regarded as an irrespon-
sible youth. Immediately after the forma-
tion of the Federation he was snapped up
by the Commonwealth for the job he held
right up to the time of his death.
Dead at 39 Professor Bernard Muscio, a
great scholar, clear thinker and modest
gentleman. Philosophy was his specialty,
and it is just four years since he succeeded
Professor Anderson in a Challis chair at
Sydney. He came from the Manning River,
and as a student of Philosophy and Logic
his was probably tlxe most brilliant career at
the Uni. After winning the Woolley Scholar-
ship lie became a lecturer at Cambridge on
experimental psychology, and wrote pretty
extensively on industrial psychology and in-
dustrial administration. His widow, a daugh-
ter of one-time Deputy-Registrar-General
Pry, is one of the clear brains working on
Sydney committees in the cause of Woman.
As far as the original ironmasters are
concerned, Death has now wound up the
firm of G. and C. Hoskins; the grave last
week swallowed George, the elder brother,
and Charles died a few months ago. George
learned to be an engineer at Ballarat, and
it was he who started the business in Sydney.
It was the younger brother who pro-
vided the ambition for big things which
expanded the business into the vast concern
now existing at Lithgow and elsewhere;
but the brother in the background, paying
close attention to the practical side, made
up the balance in an ideal partnership. He
did not give up his work until seven years
ago, when he was 70. A quiet man and well
read, he was a generous giver of the wealth
the firm’s operations brought him.
Alec Peacock, already heavy and getting
to look venerable, found himself in familiar
surroundings when attending the conference
on finance in the House of Reps, chamber.
Por 12 years lie sat there as member for
Clunes and Allandale before Federation ;
and during the third session of the Federal
Convention (1808) he was there again as
one of Vic.’s 10. It must have been this
familiarity which emboldened him to say
“damned” in the sacred place—-lie declared
that any higher income-tax would make the
States “damned unpopular.”
Ned Hogan has been elected Leader of the
Opposition in Vic. Assembly as well as
leader of the Labor Party, so now he will
be entitled to the £2OO a year allowance
provided by law. The only thing he has
made a noise abflut up to the present is the
apathy shown by the Ministry to Labor’s
suggestion for the appointment of a com-
mittee to investigate the fcause of the mid-
summer forest fires and the failure of the
Forest Commission to check them.
The last king but one to be bitten by the
lower animals was Alexander of Greece,
and his death, caused by a monkey, paved
the way for the restoration of disreputable
father Constantine. Disreputable father, and
disreputable brother who followed, paved the
way for a tottery republic. The last king
to be bitten is Haakon of Norway, who got
mixed up with a dog. This gives his maj-
esty a fairly wide choice, including hydatids,
distemper and rabies. Hydatids are quiet
but disagreeable, the possibilities of dis-
temper are uncertain, but a king who has
rabies barks all over the palace and bites
the Court.
Recently The Bulletin noted that it was
personal pressure by Cardinal Mundelein on
Archbishop Mannix that induced the latter
to take his latest trip. Now Mundelein has
instructed Dr. Mannix by cable to prepare
and preach the star sermon at the Chicago
Congress on the object of the gathering: “The
Eucharist as the Organ of Peace.”
The passing in Sydney recently of A. G.
Dobson, who held an expert’s job on the
N. S. Wales railways, recalls that his father
was Austin Dobson, famous as a writer of
graceful formal verse, and author of the
Limerick about the young lady of Niger who
smiled a.s she rode on a tiger. Several Eng-
lish writers, including Kipling, have had a
shot at re-writing that masterpiece, but they
haven’t been able to improve on it.
“N.M.H.”: The smithy in which young
H. V. McKay s first harvester was built still
stands at Drummartin (Vic.).
G. A. Iveartland, who has left a name be-
hind in divers ways, has passed over the
range at Preston (Vic.), aged 78. Mount
Iveartland in Central Australia; a plant, the
Gardenia keartiandii; and a bird, Keartland’s
honeyeater. will provide him with immor-
tality on this earth. In between “comping”
for the Age for 50 years, he found time to be
an enthusiastic naturalist and to accompany
the Calvert expedition to the Sunset State
and the Spencer expedition to the N.T.
The S. Aus. education service had two
conspicuously musical families, the Mcßrides
and the Kennedys. and they combined when
Kauri Kennedy (though he was of a Sydney
branch of the family) married Dorothy Mc-
Bride—Lauri is now John McCormack’s
concert colleague. The head of the Mc-
Brides, W.J., who was a school inspector for
many years, had most to do with organising
Adelaide’s annual “thousand-voices” concert.
He finished a useful life last w r eek, aged 74.
Frank Mack, who applied to pastoral and
agricultural work the principles of indus-
trial efficiency, reckoned the later years of
his life were “bucksliee” handed to him by
kindly Fate. Whilst travelling on aP. and
O. liner years ago he fell overboard one dark
night. Fortunately his fall was seen, and,
the liner being hove to, he was rescued. He
went to Narromine 40 years ago and taught
the people of the Western Plains that theirs
is wheat-land. He planted up to 0000 acres
in a year, and, besides, bred aristocratic
sheep. Nearly all his employees were ancient
inhabitants, Mack’s idea being that a man
was a new hand until he had been with him
20 years.
A hero of his day was James Shute, who
was a clerk in the Wellington branch of the
Bank of N.S.W. in 1891 when a robber
arrived and invited him to put up his hands.
Instead Shute leapt at the intruder, and,
having beaten him in a rough-and-tumble,
ROLAND GREEN, cx-Digger and M.H.R.
for the Richmond (N.S.W.).
chased him. He didn’t catch him alive —
the man suicided to avoid capture. The in-
cident brought Shutc to the notice of his
chiefs, who rewarded him with a managerial
job, and thereafter promotion was steady.
He died at Hurstville (Sydney) the other
day.
The next Melbourne Eight-hour procession
will lack James Wnrdloy, yrlio, in spite of
his 110 years, took his usual place of honor
at the last oiiting, not having missed a single
show since the movement he helped to start
was inaugurated. Wardley, many years pre-
sident-of the Bakers’ Union, had 21 children,
and 17 of them are still going strong.
An ancient murder mystery is recalled by
the death, at 92, of Edward Brennan, one-
time Governor of Beechworth (.Vie.) Gaol.
A man named Slack was found dead in a
house at South Melbourne with a razor in
his hand and suicide w r as ascribed. Barnes,
a professional housebreaker, serving a sen-
tence for some small offence, was heard by
Brennan murmuring “Poor old Slack!” in
his cell. Further inquiries brought the
tender-hearted homicide to the gallows.
Gone out suddenly in New York to acute
appendicitis while on a holiday trip, Father
Frank (“Plugger Bill”) Merner. Born just
on 50 years ago in Victoria, and educated by
the Christian Brothers, he finished up at the
Cardinal’s College, and very soon became
one of Victoria’s best-known R.C. lecturers
and organisers. Especially was he a sharp
thorn in the sides of the Irish clergy, with
his slogan “Australian clergy for the Aus-
tralians.” In pursuance of his principles
lie w T as the prime mover in founding the
Manly Union, composed of ex-students and
pledged to support Australians. He was
first editor of the official organ, Manly, and
ran it successfully for years. Only a little
man, with the. Pauline bald head, but as
full of energy as a bomb.

Made the Great Voyage last Thursday, Cap-
tain Walter J. Snadden, one of the best-
known shipmasters on the coast. Born in-
South Auk. in ’7O, he went to sea in sail,
and rose to be master under most of the
shipping cos. in the Commonwealth. At
the outbreak of war he was put in command
of the ex-enemy vessel Altona, renamed Con-
argo, and performed a fine bit of seamanship
in taking her through the Straits of Magellan
and up to the United States with one of her
propeller-blades missing. After this his love
of "small vessels came to the top, and he
joined the tug Heroic for her voyage to Eng-
land for the Admiralty. In the Mascot, an
old crock of a schooner, he made a voyage
to the Solomons, and suffered badly from
malaria, from which he never recovered. With
Captain Lawrence and other shipmasters he
founded the Merchant Service Guild, which

W e ( ! ul y record he ever made was
that of bemg the most smashed-up skipper in
Australia. Ills record of fractures included
various ribs, two toes, a wrist, two fingers
and compound fractures of the right hand,
light thigh and jaw. But perhaps his nar-
rowest escape was as mate of the lost Dor-
rigo off-the Queensland coast last April. His
widow is a Tasmanian.
“Eat of the wangai [native plum] and
you will come back again,” says the Torres
btrait islander to the visitor. One who
apparently chewed some of the fruit in his
younger days, Father Chester, of the Pas-
siomst Order and son of one of the first
Government representatives at Thursday
Island, goes up from Sydney every year
with the south-east breeze and puts in his
vacation in the Strait. Though he will not
see 60 again, he is still active enough to go
cruising round the islands in a small cutter
and renew acquaintanceship with the old
hands who remember the days when the first
expedition, led by Chester, senior, went
across to New Guinea.
Written his last prescription, Dr. John
Bridges Mason, of Launceston (Tas.), who
died on the eve of his 92nd birthday. He
was the oldest member of the Royal College
of Surgeons, Edinburgh, and probably the
oldest medico on the Australian register.
After being at school with Joe Chamberlain,
he came to Australia in the ’fifties for the
benefit of his health, joined in the gold rush,
and was present at the Eureka Stockade
riots. After returning to England to take
his degrees he came back, and his was the
first red lamp on the Gympie (Q.) goldfields.
The “Hobbs Millions” are to have another
spin, the claimants having held' a meeting
and resolved to renew their activities, though
two previous missions to England produced
nothing. There are some 500 claimants
(Australia is the home of claimants), and
the pile, is estimated at £4,000,000. John
Hobbs, silk-weaver, of England, left the
nucleus of the fortune to his brother, Robert
Hobbs, farmer, of Australia, and his law-
fully-born children; but Robert Hobbs is
recorded to have been married in 1815, and
all his nine children were born before’ that
date. They were ruled out as “natural,”
and wdien R. Hobbs died in 1839 the money
went out of the family. The claim rests on
the theory that the Dobbses were. secretly
married by a priest before they began to
acquire a family, and that they re-married
in 1815 for murky reasons. If the priest
can be found, and he might still be a vigor-
ous man of 150, there are certainly possi-
bilities.
“T.P.”: Many years ago a shock-headed
boy was brought for a professional opinion to
the Rev. Ralph Brown, a Wesleyan parson,
H. W. JAMES, of
Melbourne, Federal
president of the
National Roads
Association .
of Victoria, whose
side-line was phre-
nology; he drew
up charts, and lec-
tured far and wide
on “Heads and
Faces.” Brown
went nap on this
particular young-
ster. “A future in-
ventor and mechani-
cal expert,” was
his verdict—“the
finest head I have
put my fingers on.”
The boy was the
late Hugh Victor
McKay, of Sun-
shine Harvester
fame.
Australia is likely to make acquaintance
with an old ommy who was as notorious —
especially at this end of the world —as any
one man in the Big War, if the yacht Comet,
which is taking a party of tourists round the
world, comes this way. Graf von Luckner,
who made Australasian history when he
commanded the raider Wolf, is the Comet’s
skipper. Although regarded as a beastly
pirate during the war, when sinking Eng-
lish vessels and keeping cleverly out of the
way of the pursuing warships was his daily
occupation, Luckner made himself pleasant
to some of the captives with whom he came
into contact, and once, when lie took a cap-
tured British vessel into a Brazilian port, he
bound up his right arm in a sling so as to
avoid having to sign any false declarations.
He had some respect for scraps of paper.
PAID.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Air. Lambert. (N.S.W.) said he did not like a
man who ‘skited’ about his war service. He would
say ‘Treat soldiers well, but do not allow them to
loaf on the community. The ex-soldier was paid
for his job and paid for it well. The men who
died on Gallipoli, they were well paid.’ ”
The men who went through Hell for us, who bled
for us and fell for us, .
Whose bones are on Gallipoli and many a foreign
field,
Deserve, the whole array of them, the best that
you can say of them;
In giving them their meed of praise, to nobody
I yield.
They have a sort of claim on us—to question it
were shame on us—-
When jobs are going ’tis only fair their merits
should be weighed;
But with such duty binding you, excuse me for
reminding you
That even those who died for us were excellently
paid.
They ploughed through blood and flame for us, they
won a crown of fame for us ;
With hungry seas to west of them and frowning
crags to east,
They faced a realm—the might of it! But there’s
no need to skite of it,
Their glorious deeds we still recall, one day a
year at least.
And some—ah ! war’s black, hatefulness !—will never
know, our gratefulness.
And many, a man will limp through life, a wasted
frame and frayed ;
They stood in bloodiest strife for us, they grudged
nor limb nor life for us.
’Tis comfortable to reflect that, all of them were
paid.
They struck for all that’s dear to you. But, unlike
some more near to you,
Remember they were never forced to strike for
higher pay.
Good jobs they had and stuck to them. And so I
wish good luck to them,
And may remunerative toil in peace-time come
their way.
Still, while their deeds may fire a chap, too loud
heroics tire a chap ;
Beware of overdoing it when the butter on is
laid ;
Although they went through Hell for us, and valiantly
fell for us,
’Tis just as well to keep in mind the fact that
they were paid.

ABORIGINALITIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES-LINSEED OIL
GRATEFUL THAT HE STOPPED WHEN HE DTD.
COUNSEL (who has made heavy weather of it): “I’m sorry I
couldn't do more for you.”
CONVICTED CLIENT: “Don’t mention it, governor. Ain’t five years
enough?”
“S.N.R.”: I Wish Allan W. Dawes’s
charming “Bellbirds on the Prince’s Highway” had
appeared in “Aboriginal ities” some weeks earlier,
for then they would have given me as mucli pleasure
and more peace of mind. While holidaying at
Eden recently, I motored, as recommended, to view
historic Boydtown. An ominously intermittent yet
persistent squeaking, which I interpreted as coming
from a broken ball-bearing in some part of the car’s
innards, robbed the outing of much of its interest
and instruction. Where would I get a car’s vitals
attended to in Eden —and there were 400 miles to
home ? Back at the hotel I expatiated at length.
One man laughed. “All motorists get that trouble
there,” he said. “Don’t worry—you’ll find the
squeaks have gone for good when you take the car
out in the morning. It’s the bellbirds. They call
that part Bellbird Hill.” Incredulous but hopeful,
I “tried her out” before resuming our tour next day.
Too right—the car no longer had any bee (or bird)
in its bonnet. Those bellbirds on the Prince’s High-
way had affected me differently. But, then, I’m no
poet.

“Country Ped”: Prickly-pear will grow’
anywhere all right. Eighteen months ago I cut a
slit in a small leaf, or rather leaf-stalk, and hung it
by a piece of string to a nail on the school wall.
Save that it gradually but very slowly shrivelled,
I saw no change in its appearance until the other
day, when I noticed it standing out from the wall.
I turned the exhibit over and discovered two leaves
about 3in. long and lin. wide growing upwards
from two “eyes” near the bottom edge. After this,
I reckon that any Victorian farmer who has a
prickly-pear hedge on his property should be regarded
as an enemy of the State,
* * *, *
“E. J.H.”: It may interest “Bouragi” and
“Feng-Shui” to learn that there is one corner of
Australia in which concubinage and marriage be-
tween whites and native blacks are flourishing insti-
tutions. I refer to the n.-w. corner of Eyre’s Penin-
sula (S.A.). Here all sorts of mixtures are to be
found: white men more or less married to full-
blooded native, half-caste and quarter-caste women:
half-caste women to quarter-castes and so on.
There are scores of the children of such unions in
the district. Nobody seems to mind. The newly-
appointed manager of a station once went into resi-
dence accompanied by his wife —a full-blooded gin. In
time to come there is bound to be a considerable
population of hybrids, the offspring of these unions,
in this part of Australia.

“X2X”: The custom of adding charcoal
to dubious meat in order to “purify” it, referred to
by “Wingella” (B. 13/'5/’26), is a most dangerous
one. The smell of tainted flesh is the warning that
ptomaine bodies, or animal alkaloids of high toxic
powers, have been formed in it, and while the char-
coal may remove any unpleasant taste or smell from
the meat by absorbing, the gases to which it is due,
the ptomaines are left unchanged, and as capable as
ever of getting in their deadly work. Some years
ago a Victorian ease of ptomaine-poisoning by tainted
meat, in which seven persons were affected, was
caused in this manner.
* * * *
“Jcdbfr” : Many years ago an old aborigi-
nal on the Daly River (N.T.), famed for his bush
lore', pointed out to me
whilst we were cross-
ing a depression several
small pipe-like forma-
tions that protruded
from the ground a
couple of inches, with
a narrow breathing-
hole in the centre, lie
told me that under-
neath was a turtle who
had dug himself in dur-
ing the wet season and,
the ground becoming
hard, was now unable
to move; to prove it,
he dug one out with
his yam-stick. He then
told me that “By and
bye big fellow goanna
come along an’ listen
alonga hole. Suppose
turtle no more dead,
him dig him up and
show turtle alonga
waterhole.” I passed on
and forgot the incident
until recently it was
brought to mind. While
travelling in the same
district I came across
a goanna industriously
scratching in a lew,
open patch of country
about 10 chains from a
stream. On sighting
me he made off, and
I decided to wait in
shelter and watch. Two
hours later the reptile
returned, and opera-
tions were resumed.
Presently a half-baked
turtle the size of my
tropical hat staggered
out of the excavation
and dizzily shook itself.
Then the go. ran away
a few yards, returning
to snap at the turtle,
which at last followed
him. I brought up
the rear in time to see the turtle take a header
into a waterhole and the friendly go. disappear into
the jungle.

“11.Y.E.”: At the end of March, on the
conclusion of a fairly heavy fall of rain along the
South Coast of N. S. Wales, I observed a vast number
of spine-tailed swifts, so many that they seemed to
fdl the whole blue space overhead. Some of the
birds were “hawking” insects comparatively close
to the ground, and others flew at a moderate height,
but the majority of the birds were sailing, circling
and, at times, hovering at such a distance above
that they were dwarfed almost into invisibility.
They were assembling in great companies pre-
paratory to their migration to their nesting grounds
abroad, a trifling journey of from 3000 to 4500
miles—trifling, anyhow, to a bird which on high
gear can easily do 200 miles inside the hour..
* * * *
“Black Tracker”: Because a pure-bred
dairy bull that cost £5O went mad and killed the
man in charge, the owner at first decided to destroy
it, but later sold the
beast for a fiver. The
buyer, a retired drover,
operated, and the bull
became as docile as a
poddy calf. He simply
cut the small muscles
on either side of the
front legs. This pre-
vented the animal
throwing its full weight
on the forelegs when
about to charge, and
consequently it lost
confidence in its powers
of attack. The surgery
did not, however, in-
terfere with the bull’s
utility work, and it is
now doing good service.
“Guchulain”: At
Barralier (N.S.W.)
the other day two
sheep turned up that
had been missing eight
years. Lachlan Lang,
of Wombeyan Caves,
their owner, had given
them up years ago,
knowing that they had
strayed into the moun-
tains, Both the wan-
derers had a 20in. un-
broken fleece, from
which grass was grow-
ing freshly. When killed
and dressed, one
weighed 721 b., the other
70. Some of the grass
sprouting from the
wool was three inches long.
* * * *
“Ben Zine”: I don’t know what some may
do, but the Norwegian whalers who have lately
called at southern M.L. ports don’t use motor-boats
as “chasers,” nor despatch their catches with elec-
tricity (B. l/4/’26). The “chasers” I have seen
are steam-driven boats of sufficient speed and power
to accomplish both the chasing of whales and the
towing of their carcases to the mother-ship. A
harpoon-gun is placed forward in the bows, and the
harpoon itself contains near its point a bomb which
explodes upon the weapon penetrating the whale's
body. This gives the monster a quick despatch,
after which air is pumped into the internal cavity
of the capture, making it incapable of sinking.
* « * i *
“Kriz”: The Nor’-Westralian gins had
their hair shingled long before the white woman
thought about it. But in the gins’ ease tribal
needs made the demand, not Fashion. When there
was a shortage of suitable grasses for twine-making,
human hair was substituted. It is very uncommon
to see colored sister in the Nor’-West with long
hair, but some years back a big native and two
well-built gins were brought to Broome from Wynd-
ham to stand trial for the murder of a white man.
One of the two had a head of hair fine, long and
glossy black; the other’s was cut very short, and
from the look of it the cutting had been lone
with a piece of broken glass.
# * * *
“Soda”: “Wingella” acclaims gum-arabic
for the curative treatment of diarrhosa. Certainly
it forms a thin film over the' intestine walls, but for
how long ? Diarrhoea usually (and almost always
in the Tropics) is due to bacilli. You have to kill
them or keep the eomplaiyit. Gum-arabic does not
kill anything. The bacillary condition'—in fact,
any dyssenteric condition—means an abnormal flow of
intestinal secretions. That flow must be stopped
and an astringent medicine fs the only thing that
will do it. Gum-arabic is not an astringent. The
best bush medicine for such a complaint is an In-
fusion of red-gum, Kino eucalypti, the W.A. variety,
which, besides being demulcent —as is gum-arabic—
is astringent and an intestinal antiseptic. This gum
has no equal in bush therapeutics; in fact, by its
merits and the persistence of Ed. Mayhew, of Perth,
botanist, it has found a place in the British Pharma-
copoeia.
* ■« * *
“Cadaver” : On Chillagoe (N.Q.) field, in
the golden long ago a miner died on Saturday night.
Sunday morning early a party of diggers left to
“sink the shaft,” with the corpse to follow. The
country thereabout is steep, almost an unbroken
succession of gorges, and the.. buryingrgrQund .was
some distance away. The pit finished, and a piece
of timber cut for a head-piece, the miners sat back
to wait.- ' “Bill’s late,” said someone. Bill was
the departed, and time dragged. Using the head-
piece for a winning-post, two men ran three dis-
tances for a tenner a side, while the mourners
wagered on the result. A miner hacked himself
to clear the grave endways in a standing jump, and
won. In the middle of a well-conducted clog-fight the
extemporised hearse came in sight, and three cheers
rent a cubic mile of space. But Bill wasn’t
aboard. The driver was too drunk to be astonished,
or even interested. Evidently the deceased had
slipped off the dray at some steep point and
ricocheted from rock to rock into his last long
resting place at the bottom of a gorge to which it
•was impossible- to follow him.
SOMETHING TO DO WHAT SHE LIKED WITH.
“Stop crying, you big baby!”
“I won’t. It’s me own cry.”
“Mars”: Yarns about old-time teamsters
tapping liquid cargo (B. 6/5/’26) remind me. Old
Tom Jones, in the pre-railway days, was driving his
team from Barcaldine loaded with supplies of all
kinds, including two cases of brandy. On his way
he met two cobbers, and to celebrate the occasion
decided to hand out some of the liquor. Carefully
removing the nails of one of the cases he invited his
pals to help themselves. At the end of the bout
all that remained was the case and a dozen empty
bottles. Gathering the dead marines, he replaced
them and carefully closed the case down again. Then,
placing it on the track, he drove his waggon over it,
picked it up, and resumed his journey. A carefully
prepared account of the “accident” did not go down
with a suspicious publican. “Well, open the case for
yerself,” said Tom, “and see if everything ain’t
there.” The publican turned over the smashed case,
and minutely examined its shattered contents. “Satis-
fied?” queried Tom. “No,” came the unexpected
reply, “you forgot to put the corks back.”
BEASTLY INTERFERING.
“Hey! Come out of that. Bathing is not
allowed here.”
“Pardon me, I’m not bathing. I’m drowning.”
“Narara”: “Morice” (B. 29/4/26) is
wrong when he says blue-eyed parents never have
brown-eyed children. I knew a German family who
lived on the Hawkesbury. Both parents were typical
fair-haired, blue-eyed Teutons. They had eight child-
ren. Six of them were of pronounced Teutonic type,
but the other two, were apparently throwbacks to
some ancestor. The third child, a girl, was dark
skinned and had brown hair and brown eyes. The
seventh was a boy. He was dark and had odd eyes,
one brown and one grey.

A REAL NEED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“There are times when one feels the limitations
of our language.”
The memories that phrase invites!
What words are there among
The splash, thei jar, the stabbing lights
(I’m quoting H. G. Wells), the heights,
Arid so forth, of our English tongue
To cheer the wight whom Fortune deals
Some stroke his hopes to mar?
Or really ease the first, fierce pangs
Of him who vigorously bangs
A hammer on his thumb ?
Is there relief in “Oh!” or “Ah!”
Or some such exclamation ? Bah !
He might as well be dumb.
So when he’s well and truly narked,
What is a bloke to say?
What vent for him whose shin is barked?
For, as Bob Acres! once remarked,
The Damns have had their day;
And Shaw has made of “bloody” quite
A trivial thing and tame.
’Twould seem the wretch consumed with woe
Who cuts his chin or stubs his toe
Or loses all his splosh
Must cry aloud on Moses’ name,
Or in his agony exclaim
“Jehoshaphat!” or “Gosh!”
Maybe with vigor undeterred,
Though few his glory note,
There swears alone, unseen, unheard,
Some master of the sizzling word
In solitudes remote.
Fate keeps him like a treasure hid
Till, with elation meet,
This marvel, from whose mighty tongue
Amazing synonyms are flung,
With some invective terse
Shall supersede old terms effete
And give the world a new, complete,
Soul-satisfying curse.

“Really”: I support “Wilga’s” defence of
the starling (B. 15/4/'2O). I know a number of
Vic. Western District squatters who consider this
bird their best ally. In 1907, when starlings were
practically unheard of there, one squatter placed
800 sheep in an 825-acre paddock in November,
feed being then abundant. By February they were
starving, owing to the depredations of a plague of
grasshoppers. The starlings appeared shortly after-
wards, and grasshoppers have since been almost un-
known. The same paddock will now fatten 900
sheep from November to February regularly each year.
Another friend of mine, an orchard'ist near Ballarat,
never shoots a starling, though hundreds are seen
about his orchard—facetiously called “The Starlings’
Retreat.” Occasionally the family have frightened
the starlings away from the part of the orchard
nearest the house, but now they fly there unchecked,
as in that part the apples in the absence of the
birds were infested with codlin-moth, whilst at
the other end, where they were undisturbed, there
was not an infected apple to be found.
“Azac”: The starling, according to “Wilga,” de-
stroys “millions of the larval of blowflies.” The
only systematic investigation ever undertaken in
N. S. Wales to determine the value of birds in com-
, bating the blowfly in sheep was carried out by J.
B. Cleland (Dept, of Public Health), J. H. Maiden,
ex-Government Entomologist Froggatt and others
about eight years ago. In those investigations
special attention was paid to the starling and the
sparrow as suggested enemies of the blowfly. The
stomach contents of 73 starlings -were examined.
Grasshoppers were found in five, wireworms in two,
cutworms in 34, flies in four (not definitely identified
as blowflies), psyllids in one and scale in one. The
authors in summing up the evidence stated: “Neither
the starling nor the sparrow apparently plays any
definite part in controlling the blowfly pest. The
starling does marked harm to fruit gardens and does
some harm to crops. It does some good in destroy-
ing certain insect pests, such as cutworms, when
they are present in abundance and perhaps other
food is scarce.” Against the starling is also the
fact that it interferes with the breeding-places of
many insectivorous birds more useful than itself.

“Tamornie” : When carrying casks of rum
in Vest Queensland years ago. we did not, unless
the occasion was one of great need, interfere with
the hoops on the casks or even use a gimlet. We
stood the cask upright and poured a billy of boiling
water on the end. In the morning the fluid was
more than strongly flavored with the rum.
* * * *
“Larrapinta”: You can’t beat the bush
cocky for improvising tools. I called in to see one
a few weeks ago, and found him examining the leg-
of a horse held in a crush-pen. It
was budl.v swollen, with a gash in
it about 4in. long. I expected to
see some of the usual bush surgery,
but was wrong. His daughter ap-
peared with a tray, on which were
a basin of sterilising solution con-
taining some surgical instruments,
a basin of lysol and a small medi-
cine chest. After washing his
hands, Whiskers took a hypoder-
mic syringe, injected a local
anesthetic above the wound, and,
as soon as it was numb, shaved
the hair from around it. Then
he opened it up with a scalpel,
cleaned and syringed it out, and
sewed it up neatly, using an
interrupted suture every half-inch.
A bandage completed the oper-
ation, and the prad was then
turned loose. In response to my
questions he said that he had
studied veterinary science in the
school of Commonsense under Pro-
fessor Blanky Necessity. He had
made all the instruments except
the pair of scissors and the
hypodermic syringe. The scalpel,
lance, tenetone and other knives
he had forged from the shanks of
broken metal drills; the tweezers
he had cut out of an old saw;
the needles were the ordinary
household articles, ground flat,
heated, and then bent into shape
and re-hardened. He had copied
the shapes and patterns from the
illustrations in a surgical-instru-
ment catalogue. They certainly
did him credit, being very well
made, and ground and polished
till they looked like silver. The
knives were as keen as razors, and
the whole outfit was an object-lesson to the
tobacco-knife and tar brigade of vets.
* * * »
“The Rumpus" : I wasn’t aware that an
octopus could travel on land until I witnessed one
on the move at Flinders Bay (W.A.).f We were
after small rock-crab for groper-bait, and as we
approached a stretch of sand a filmy white object
shot across and sought a hiding-place under the
ledge of a rock. Soon I had a crab-spear at work
probing for it, and feeling something impaled on the
point I gently withdrew it to find one octopus feeler
wrapped around the end. Presently a head emerged
to see what was doing, and instantly receded on
sight of me. The arm let go the spear and vanished.
Again I prodded and after many misses dragged the
octopus into daylight, where 1 pinioned him through
the back into the sand. All his feelers shot to one
side and tore at the sand to pull .his body clear,
and so strong was the tug that his body began to
tear through. Finally he managed to escape, and,
badly lacerated, rushed towards the water with
amazing speed. At the edge I grabbed with my bare
hand and hurled the escapee into the air. The cap-
ture weighed 61b. and made splendid bait.
“Centurion”: If “Sport” (B. 13/5/’26)
wants to get the knack of wing-shooting with a shot-
gun, he can’t do better than take up the method
followed by British bird-shots. Let him keep both
eyes open, look at the bird and not along the barrel,
swing the gun with the target, and—this is all
important—continue it after pulling the trigger;
A DARK ACE IN BETWEEN.
“’Ad a drink lately, Bill?”
“Not fee years."
“'Ow long?”
“Well, must be all of ’alf a’ ’our.”
don’t check, whatever you do. This will give far
better results than the ancient method of aiming
ahead of the bird and chancing his flying into the
Another important matter 'is that of
judging distance and not wasting cartridges at im-
possible ranges. Forty yards is a fair thing for most
guns, especially with densely-feathered birds like
ducks.
“Twelve Bore”: With a rifle one takes a steady
aim, holds his breath and presses the trigger. Not
so with a gun fired instantly it touches the user’s
shoulder. After the war many of us took up
our sporting guns again. Personally it was some
time before I got out of the habit of taking steady
aim and following the mark, and I never got a hit
until the old instinct returned. There is no set
rule for cross shots; experience only will give a
“sport” the knack of hitting without an aiming
pause. Few men combine efficiently both rifle and
gun shooting.
“Buttenderry”: In my opinion the essential to
successful fast side-on shooting is to shoot
ahead of the target, the distance being deter-
mined by three things: (1) The speed at which
the target is moving, (2) the distance it is from the
gun, and (3) the “spread” of the gun itself. To be
successful a shot at a black-duck or teal coming
round a bend, with the wind behind it, has to be
directed well ahead. Many good shots follow the
target with the gun before firing (to follow after
is useless), but, personally, I prefer snap-shooting.
After all, 'it is mainly a matter of getting to know
your gun, and then practice.
“Bill R.”: Following with an aim is absolutely
futile when the quarry is a wallaby, hare or rabbit
fleeing in the : scrub, or a bird darting among
bushes that allow a space of only a yard or two into
which to shoot. To become successful at hitting
moving objects under all conditions a gunman must
practise the knack of snap-shooting-—that is, throw-
ing his gun upon the object and firing simultaneously.
After a good many wasted shots the art becomes
instinctive. But to become an expert the game’s
mode and rate of progression have also to be studied.
The long-tails travel in bounds and the time to
knock them is when they lob. Hares run straight,
but their speed must be correctly judged to send
the shot a sufficient distance across in front of them.
Rabbits dart from side to side, and the expert
sportsman gets them, as they commence a course
in their zigzag. He always shoots under an approach-
ing flier and over one that is going away.

“E.S.”: Has anyone ever heard a sound,
even a whisper, uttered by our stately jabiru? It is
known as. the bird of silence, and thereon Black
Brother appends a legend. A long time ago the
bird was a garrulous fowl and a stickybeak. He
spied on the blac-kfeHows’ secrets, and went about
chuckling and prattling like a gossiping old woman.
One day he hid in a tree above the bora ground,
where the initiation rites were being performed, and
subsequently told, what he had seen to two gins. The
men soon heard of it, for the gins started to babble
like the brook. The bird was captured and sentenced
to have a piece of his tongue bitten -off by the
carpet-snake. When the reptile took hold, having
pretended that he wanted to look inside the jabiru's
fine long beak, the bird’s huge mandibles shut down
with a snap on its head. That is why the carpet-
snake’s head is flat, and the jabiru “can’t talk urn”
any more.

“Xamilc”: The Abo. scribe who recently
stated that scrub cattle had been known to take
cover like rabbits when pursued has come in for a
good deal of chaffing. Twenty years ago in the
dense turkey-bush, pine and vine scrubs of the upper
Warrego (Q.), it was quite common, after starting
10 or 12 head, to find
the crashing and tramp-
ling dwindle to an un-
canny silence after the
first 400 yards. Track-
ing would then dis-
close single beasts
tucked away under
clumps of thick bush.
These cattle were mus-
tered with the aid of
“coachers,” i.c., a
quieter but still lively
mob driven behind the
trackers. The scrubbers
were wheeled into these
and the whole sent
along “hell for
leather.” If the wild
mob split into ones and
twos, as they invari-
ably did, or broke
singly from the
coachers, each man
took a beast—a clean-
skin for choice—threw
it, either from horse-
back or on foot, after
running it a while, and
tied its hind legs to-
gether with a strap.
Then the coachers were
brought to each 'beast,
and after the station
earmark had been put
on with a knife and
the points of the horns
sawn off, it was let
up and held with the
others. The wildness
of some of the beasts
was such that they refused to eat or drink for
days after capture, while others appeared to break
their hearts, for they dic-d within a few hours.
* * # #
“Moreton”: Out-back Bananaland shire
councils are complaining of the tactics of stock-
owners who in dry seasons turn out their old horses
to graze on the roadside grass. The councils impound
the strays, feed them for a month on the common, then
sell them at auction, without reserve. The owner
does not claim his animals, since he would have
to pay pound and agistment, fees if he did so, but goes
to the sale and buys them for 6d. or is. a head,
and then turns them loose again. It’s a cheap way
of getting feed. At Bauliinia one man bought eight
horses for 7s. If the old crocks are so infirm that
they have to be destroyed, the council has to pay a
man to shoot them. In some cases the owner has
had the hide to apply for the job of destroying his
own unclaimed horses, and has been paid 10s. or
15s. for doing it.
AN EASY ONE.
“A reunions bloke just asked me teas there
anything caused more misery than
drink.”
“And what did yer say to him?”
“'Course! A blanky thirst like mine.”
“Machete": Queensland is making great
use of motor transport in the Western areas. Apart
from goods services, trucks holding 80 to 100 sheep
now tail mobs that are being shifted from drought
country, and the weaklings are picked up as they
drop out and carted on to feed and water. The
motor-lorry is aiding, too, in the distribution of
feed over wide areas of eaten-out country. The
ground is covered at a good speed, the hay, lucerne,
etc., being tossed out en route and spread over
paddocks which would have taken horse teams days
to cover.
BUSHLAND TREES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The mulga clump and the ti-tree glade,
The wattle and oak and kurrajong,
They serve our needs with blossom and shade
And gladden our hearts with festive song.
Gay magpies carol and bellbirds call
By road and river, by range and lake;
And kings of the forest are gum-trees tall
When the sunlit world is wide awake.
Red roofs that blaze on the harbor heights,
Tall steeples and towers and market domes,
The curtained panes and the softened lights
That brighten the halls of peaceful homes
Wake no regrets in the wayward souls
Who quaff the wine of the mountain breeze —
Their hearts are cheered by the campfire coals
When night winds rustle the highland trees.
The swaggie drifts on the river routes;
They hold him under a lifelong spell.
They echo the fall of his broken boots;
The scent of his pipe they know full well.
Each camping tree is a wayside inn
Whose name he fashions with fancy free;
To-night he sleeps at the “Harlequin,”
To-morrow he dines at the “Wishing Tree.”
Out in the West, where the red sand rolls
In billowy peaks to a garish sky,
The vision comes to the outcast soids
Who follow the gleam though death be nigh.
Over the ridge with quartz ablaze
The fossicker’s pick-point cracks and drums;
His hopes are out in the mocking haze,
His home is under the salmon gums.
The trees are sad when a grey world grieves;
They share its measures of shouting joy,
While birds build high in their dancing leaves
Above the reach of the boldest boy.
They croon the wisdom of ages past,
While sweethearts promise and pledge and sigh ;
When the lost wayfarer fails at last
They call him into their shade to die.
When torrents gusli from the nimbus cloud
Which rolls and scuds from the tropic North,
When rivers storm with a flood-song loud
And the fire-tongued lightning flashes forth,
When sheep are swept on the currents swift;
And homes submerged in the swirling tides
The staunch trees gather the souls that drift
And hold them safe till the flood subsides.
SEE?
“Hullo, old chap, you’re looking well.”
“Yes, just had my sight attended to.”
The clean limb cracks and the trunk recoils
And the plundered leaf too quickly fades
•On slopes where the axeman’s blade despoils
The grandeur of leafy colonnades;
Then scourging winds, in a demon flight,
Drive startled flames from a smoking pyre,
Till anguish screams through the scarlet night
And the forest falls to the blast of fire.
But soft rains heal and the brown seeds spring—
Young leaves shall gather the dews of morn—
While hope rides over on wind and wing
And lark-song swells from the fields of corn.
Full praise must spring in the wiser heart.
The saplings bend in the fragrant breeze;
And lights of joy in our eyes shall start
When the blossoms wake on the bushland trees.

All The World Has Taken
The Incomparable Chrysler To Its Heart
The Chrysler Six is remarked
every time it exhibits its dash-
ing appearance on road or
highway. The contrast be-
tween it and other cars is so
marked that the desire to own
one is bred then and there.
But that desire is as nothing
compared to the delight
induced later on. For the
Chrysler is just as far beyond
comparison in performance,
roadability, ease of handling
and durability as it is in looks.
That discriminating people
have taken the Chrysler to
their hearts is no surprise at
all—it is a very natural thing.
They are almost extrava-
gantly enthusiastic about the
Chrysler because the Chrysler
has shown them long-lived
motoring delights beyond all
comparison.
Ask any of the distributors
listed below to demonstrate
for you the Chrysler’s many
advantages.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
SAY-
Kayser
GLOVES
The undergrads stayed demurely at home
for their Commem. frivols this year, and a
dull party it was. However, hundreds of
girls, mothers and small children hastened
across University Park from noon onwards
anxious to get a good possy for the passing
of the procession. To this came the Norge
touring the North Pole, Russia’s Hysterical
Choir, amazingly decrepit Yellow Crabs, and
stalwart beauty-girls who might take a prize
if judged by Stadium standards. The archi-
tects, as the good boys of the family, were
the funniest. Smugly they stood, haloed
and be-winged, their gowns draped decor-
ously about' their legs, singing hymns, and
reciting the senatorial “Thou Shalt Nots.”
Not unnaturally, two flappers in zebra-
spotted hose, preferred the vets.’ show. In
this caravan rode prehistoric grizzlies whose
chief nutriment seemed to be hops. Gentle-
men with ruddy noses leered into the faces
of the crowd, and gentlemen in Greek tunics
who had obviously lost the key pattered
songs of their own; and still other gentle-men
in Roman Saratogas (they’re the same as
Cronulla shorts) tripped and skipped in time
to the erratic wanderings of Sir Dudley do
Swear’s chariot.
For the first time in this Letter’s memory
a troop of Mounted Police has attended a
function on the North Shore. So the small
boy and girl over the water saw' something
better than the movies on Saturday, when,
with these modern centaurs clattering before
and after, the Governor-General and his lady
drew' up at the gates of the Mater Hospital.
The opening of the new wing was Lord
Stonehaven’s first official job of the kind on
the Shore, and every representative citizen,
from the Boy Scouts to the Mayor, was out
to receive him. The Scouts formed an avenue
for the vice-regals up to the front door,
where they were delivered into the hands
of the Mayor, Chief Secretary Lazzarini and
G. E. Bryant, and (as the first shall be last)
Dr. Dan Kelly and Mother Paul. It was a
big day for these two. They have watched
the Mater grow from little more than a cot-
tage, he as its chief surgeon, she as head
of its nursing sisterhood. Archbishop Kelly,
who arrived a little late and a little breath-
less, did the handsome thing by their Exes,
in his introductory speech, and the G.-G.,
with graceful references all around, declared
the wing open. But it was Dr. Dan, very
earnest and not at all oratorical, w T ho said
the word that lingered in the memory:
“Cancer can be cured if taken at its first
stages.” The new wing, which has cost
£30,000, has accommodation for 100 patients.
A stranger dropping in to the Wentworth
the other night might have thought the popu-
lation of Balmain lived by taking in each
other’s doctoring. There were doctors
all the way up the long ballroom at
the dance for the Balmain and District
Hospital, and of these not the least was
kindly and enthusiastic Dr. Porter, who once
“walked” the Sydney. The seats of the
mighty were presided over by Mrs. R. L.
Ilittman, her black velvets embellished with
autumn foliage. Mrs. R. J. Donaldson and
Mrs. A. W. Summerbelle were others who
worked energetically to keep the flag flying.
Dr. Kate Ardill Brice sat with her husband,
who abides by the law —he’s a solicitor.
In jubilation over his admission to the six-
and-eightpenny pasture the two surrounded
themselves with friends and breathed in the
incense of a high silver basket brimming
with blooms.
Monday was a murky day, but inside the
Wentworth it was glittering Toyland. F'elix
the Cat came to the Marionette party, so of
course luck attended this venture for the
Girl Guides’ funds. The Governor-General’s
chicks Ava and Ariel were among the hund-
reds of happy youngsters present, and not
only won a prize in their quaint Kate Green-
away rigs of laundry-white satins, with
wreaths of the rowan-berry in their hair,
but Ariel, having changed into more work-
manlike garments, showed her Scotch ances-
try in a sword dance right in the middle
of the floor. The State vice-reine smiled
over a table at which sat daughter Elaine,
who was president of the success, and clever
Marion Russell, whose fingers had evolved
the Magnetic Lucky Dip Cottage from a
packing case. An embryo Pavlova scintil-
lated in a tip-toe dance, and caused great
argument between a small Elizabethan page
and a sturdy Alsatian peasant. “Go on,”
said the latter finally, “she isn’t real—she’s
just wounded up.”
Green and gold were the caps and green
and gold the balloons that floated on the
pool of jazz when the girls of St. Brigid’s
made merry at the Ambassadors. The dance
was the sixth yearly foregathering of the
Convent’s old girls, and the list of names,
read like a convent register: that is to
say, it included names that savored of every
tribe and nation, from the Scot to the
Chosen. The frocking, as youthful as the
dancers, was short and frilly, and had a bias
to pinks and blues. Here and there gold
flashed through the foam of georgettes like
an acrobatic goldfish, and one girl sported
a shawl woven by Mrs. Noah during the wet
spell-—it canned on its birds of the air and
sophisticated-looking fish. The president of
the dance, Miss. E. Correy, brought dignity
and black georgettes to her duties and
hostessed a big party.
There was a dinner of memories and
broiled chicken in Miss Bishop’s rooms on
Saturday evening, with Kenneth Mackay,
C. 8., as the guest of honor. Light Horseman
Colonel Vernon was in the chair, and near
by were other chiefs of the S. African Asso-
ciation. Old stories of the veldt were retold,
including a tale of an A-Battery man, now
gone beyond the call of the reveille, who
went forth armed with a sword to slay the
battery’s breakfast. This breakfast was a
movable feast any old time between noon
and three in the afternoon. At dawn or
earlier there was a matin cup of coffee,
after which the Aussie gunner pulled in his
belt and moved on, a scrap with Boers
being a frequent appetiser before the first
meal of the day. Gunner Blank, having
pursued and slain a likely looking pig for
a hungry battery, had the ill-luck to
make the horrid melee on the very place
chosen by an explosive British artilleryman
known as Colonel Lyddite for his breakfast
camp. The memory of good old gunner
Blank and his pork and the tremendous
uproar the British Colonel made about it
was honored in silence, as w T as the memory
of many another who sleeps under African
daisies.
That the Marrickvillo Hospital has an
enterprising women’s auxiliary was shown
by the extraordinary success of a dance at
the Ambassadors the other niglit. The in-
stitution wants to sprout a new wing or two
which will cost about. £20,000. Therefore,
as usual, when it’s a question of raising a
large -sum in a short time, the hand that
rocks the cradle was asked to rule the whirl.
Somebody on the committee had imagination,
too. On each table stood a basket of flower
favors —heliotrope and lavender, rosebuds
and pansies—and on payment of a small
sum each Don could treat his Donah to one
of the sweetings and lead her out into the
posy dance. Health-brokers and their ladies
were on every side, and the dressing was
sumptuous.
The musical and the theatrical world of
ibis continent herewith can greet an old
friend. He is
George Portus,
and for over
80 years he
has been in
the show
game. As a
youngster he
worked with
the J. C. Wil-
liamson man-
agement when
the great man
himself played
parts; and of
Harry Rick-
ards, for whom
he to ure d
many a show,
he has a fund
of good stories
—all to the
Cockney show-
man’s credit.
His most re-
cent overseas adventure was the managing
of the Newcastle Steelworks Band through
England, where the combination simply
lived on a diet of prizes. Now George is
concert manager for Beale’s, and is enthusi-
astic about the development of Australian
talent and concert deportment. “What does
it profit a man to have the voice of an arch-
angel if he stand like a trussed fowl?” is
his favorite admonition.
The Philistine who dropped into the Adyar
Hall the other afternoon to gaze on the ex-
position of Theorhythm found on the stage
a gentleman in a cerulean-blue tunic who
claimed to be a tree. He seemed to have
taken over Anthony Hordern’s old war-cry,
“While I live I’ll grow,” as he undulated
from toe-nail to finger-tip. Theorhythm is
said by its exponents to assist both in the
pouring out and the control of the divine
force within us that we call Creative Art.
Without its aid the artist is in danger of
becoming over-temperamental and maybe
decadent. Perhaps this is all so; but it
would be unpleasant to roost in a flattery
where the upstairs family persisted in being
trees. They might even take it into their
heads to become nesting birds, and then
think of the uproar there’d be night and
morning! Oscar lvusak was the graceful-
enough interpreter of the aspirations of the
leafy fronds; and Enid Lorimer, high-
priestess of the drama at the Balmoral
Amphitheatre, loosed a melodic voice in a
play of Yeats’s. This lady has to perfection
the play of arm and wrist known as the
Shakspearean gesture, and her voice is as
honey eaten to the murmur of violins.
Vice-Chancellor Mungo MacCallum,Knight
of the Midnight Oil, has a distinguished-
looking lady,
you’ll admit.
Th e Ma y
Moore studios
made the pic-
ture alou g-
side in a half-
ho u r san d-
wiclied in be-
tween two of
her many pre-
sidential jobs,
for the lady is
a confirmed
president: the
Aslifi e 1 d In-
fants’ Home,
the National
Council an d
the Sydney
Day Nur-
series run
smoothly un-
der her hand.
The Univer-
sity Women’s Settlement work and the
Teachers’ Central Registry are two more of
the councils and committees of which the
clear-thinking lady is a member.
Another of J. F. Archibald’s gifts to
art and the public will take concrete form
shortly; the money he set aside for a memor-
ial fountain commemorating the union of
French and Australian soldiers in the war
became available in September, and will
amount with accrued interest to £14,000.
That ought to be sufficient to provide a fine
bit of work. The Commission, according
to the terms of the bequest, is to be given
to a French artist, and the trustees, with
the assistance of Bertram Mackennal, are
now considering what part of the Botanical
Gardens they will requisition as a site.
Devotion to the scenes of her childhood
caused Miss Margaret Harris to cling to
her home at Ultimo while factories and
warehouses grew all around her; and it was
there, in William Henry-street, that the 82
year-old lady died last week. Matthew and
John, both Mayors of Sydney, were her
brothers, and she is the last of the family
of five who called Dr. Harris, the original
settler of Ultimo, great-uncle. Alany chari-
table causes will miss her; and drab
industry will continue its march over the
little oasis of old-time rusticity she so
long preserved. Not only did the indomit-
able lady refuse to acknowledge the march of
Commerce, but she determinedly ignored the
arrival of the motor. Until the end she
went about her engagements in a carriage
drawn by two white horses, on occasion
driving even as far afield as the Ryde Home
for Incurables—one of her pet charities.
By a curious irony, her last journey to Rook-
wood was by motor.
The heavenly choir will certainly find
a solo part for Sydney Pick, who heard the
call last Sunday. He was the first singer
in W.A. to be made a licentiate of the Asso-
ciated Board of the Royal Academy and
Royal College of Music. Unfit for other ser-
vice, he went to England during the war to
work upon munitions, and became principal
bass at the Glasgow Cathedral, and, subse-
quently, principal baritone at Ripon Cathe-
dral. Returning to Australia he secured the
same position in Perth, and, later, when he
came to Sydney, at St. Andrew’s; but it was
as bass soloist that lie helped to make a
triumph of the St. Andrew’s choir’s per-
formance of Bach’s “Passion” at the end
of last March. Very few singers are gifted
with such a voice, allied to fine dramatic
perception.
Harriet Bennet’s passing from “Lilac
Time” to “Rose Marie” was to have given
Opportunity (spelt with an “Oh !”) to Marie
Bremner, the Melbourne girl who, only 18
months on the stage, was to step from
understudy into principal role for the Maori-
land tour. But the gods who govern theatri-
cal destinies have decided to keep Marie in
Sydney as understudy, again to Harriet Ben-
net. Adela Crane takes the part of Lili for
the M.L; tour.
W. E. Booth, treasurer of the Shaks-
pearean Society, played the heavy father the
other day when two of his daughters ap-
proached him each with an engagement ring
on the left hand and a young man held by
the right. Youngest chick, Elsie, presented
lan Wark, D.Sc.: the eldest, Carrie, led
forward Leo Eubenstein. Leo is of Back
Creek, Henty, and lan hails from Middle
Park, Melbourne. Before the Booth family
settled at Mosman, Scone was its postal
address.
The pretty youngest daughter of artist
Ellis St. John has just said the word that
entitled Spencer Brignell, of Narrandera
and Sydney, to bind her with the usual
diamond seal.
Wedding-bells of special interest to Ful-
lers’ Lilliputians are likely to ring whilst
they are in Sydney, which will have an
opportunity of seeing something in the
nature of a toy wedding. Two of the mid-
gets, Willie Blasero, who is 25 but no big-
ger than a normal eight-year-old child, and
Melita Yorona, who is 19 and about the same
size, have decided to make their responsibili l
ties a mutual concern. They have “showed”
together for four years, but Cupid sped his
dart while they were on the way to Australia.
Another note from New York tells of the
engagement of Samuel Chotzinoff, accom-
panist to Jascha Heifetz through his Aus-
tralian tour, and Pauline Heifetz. Pauline
was the elder of the two heavily furred and
richly diamonded flappers who sat in the
front seats at brother’s concerts. The
younger girl lias already married into the
millionaire class. Chotzinoff of the long
overcoat is now a musical critic on the New
York Times.
The friends of well-known journalist Miss
O’Connor are arranging a testimonial tea-
party in her honor next month. The Mayor-
ess and Mrs. John Barlow will be pleased to
hear from any of Miss O’Connor’s friends
who are anxious to participate.
Already Miss Sarah Hynes has her com-
mittee lor acquiring a portrait of Airs. Ellis
Rowan shepherded. Mrs. A. G. Thomas pre-
sided at the first meeting at the Women’s
Club one day last week, and it was decided
to ask every woman’s organisation to take
part in the movement; £5OO is the objective,
and as a committee is to be formed in each
State and in Maoriland and in Papua, the
amount should soon be in hand.
Elsie Prince is still wanting everybody to
be happy, including the babies of St. Mar-
garet’s, so on June 10 she will lead off in
a happy cabaret at the Ambassadors. A
notable of the afternoon will be the doll
dressed as Nanette in the nifty red bathing-
suit that lady wears nightly at St. James’.
That Old Boys’ Union which goes through
life pushing a regular steam-roller of initials
before it, the S.C.E.G.S., will disport at the
Ambassadors on Monday, July 5, be the
weather fair, foul or vegetarian.
This year one Movie Ball is moving up
town, and its select address will be the Am-
bassadors. The date is July 20, and the
Sydney Day Nurseries will benefit. Tickets,
one guinea; and the number strictly limited.
Sounds almost like something at Bucking-
ham P’alace, doesn’t it?
Brisbane’s postscript:—
Arnold Weinholt interested a big roll-up of
members of the Geographical Society and others in
the teachers’ room at what was once the old Trades
Hall with stories of lion-hunting in Africa. He
had some excellent snaps and lantern-slides of both
the noble beast and the not ignoble native —bushman
and Basuto. At the close of the lecture, Dr. J. P.
Thompson announced that a Fellowship of the
Society would be presented to Captain Weinholt,
who had enabled the society to send to England a
map of hitherto unmarked country. Dr. Robertson
alluded to the Queenslander’s part in the war in
German East Africa, where he did exceptionally good
work as a scout and interpreter. Dr. Taylor, the
president, also spoke, proving that in Queensland a
man in his 85th year can still be interested in
exploration.
Deputy-Governor Lennon opened the Crystal Palace
with a poetical quotation on the occasion of the
Citizens’ Ball. The new ballroom has a daffodil
and rosewood color scheme. Black cats and daffo
dils and rosewood balloons were the decorations,
with chrysanthemums to deck the supper tables, and
the Seamen’s Institute funds. will benefit by the
shivoo. Mayor Jolly, who had the support of his
wife in black satin, thanked Mr. Lennon for his
presence and his poetry.
Eddie Cahill and George Brooke, whose concerts
are dated for June 1 and 5, have had a series of
•welcome-home parties. One of the most elaborate
was given by Mrs. A. P. Greenfield and Mrs. R. D.
Eve, when the place-cards bore the smiling faces of
the two wanderers and the fun at Lennon’s ran
into the small hours.
A dance was set by moonlight aboard the Warrego
when Commander and Mrs. Mutton and E. F. Gunner
Smith, R.N., received, amid a blaze of colored
electric lights. Palms and ferns decorated, a
band played, and there was a buffet supper.
The Women’s Club wore scarlet for its monthly
reception, when Mrs. Wedd, in black ottoman silk
over grey, presided. Mabel Zillman arranged the
musical programme and Merna Gillies played all
the accompaniments. There waS a guessing competi-
tion.
It was very windy for the Brisbane Thousand race
at Albion Park, and furs and heavy coats were
plentiful. Mrs. C. E. Sligo was in reseda, and
Cecily Cadell Garrick in green and grey. Mrs.
George Cryle wore brown, and Mrs. E. K. Tully,
Miss Cecil Palmer and Mrs. Glyn Connolly favored
navy. Mrs. Percy Reay was in black satin.
At Auchenflower bowling-green on the same day
president and Mrs. Southern were at home to a large
gathering. The Dep.-Governor, with Fred Ryder,
was there. Black and white, the club’s colors, deco-
rated the club house, and roses the tea tables.

Moonee Valley racecourse attracted what
must have been very near a record attend-
ance for a winter meeting on Saturday after-
noon. Dressing, though mostly top-coated,
was unusually cheery, and a good deal of
vivid millinery was shown. The lawns had
to compete with costumes of every tone of
green, and most of the other colors of the
paintbox were represented in feminine attire.
In the saddling-paddock sere and yellow
leaves fell from trees nigh bare upon hats
that were positively scornful in their bright-
ness. Almost every suit had its bit of fur,
mostly ’possum, it is to be supposed; but
a few lovely wraps and coats, palpably of
much more exalted origin, took attention off
the gee-gees occasionally. Only two pairs of
Russian boots were sighted, and in neither
case was the experiment successful. One lass
wore her tall snake-skin footwear in con-
junction with what was almost, but not
quite, a riding-dress. In the other case the
flared coated frock of the moment brushed
patent-leather tops. The Tallis lady sported
a wine-liued suit, trimmed with mink, and
a velour hat; Dr. Walker Sinclair’s wife
dared the cold in trim brown leather jacket
and hat and pleated plaid skirt; Mrs. James
Purves was a study in golden-brown tones,
and daughter Valerie was in Veronese red
(doth, her hat sprinkled with white beads.
Crimson draperies peeped beneath the black
wrapping of Mrs. Ben Cox to match flame-
like millinery, and Mrs. Rogers Thomson
cheered dark apparel with rose red velours.
The Firm did “The Mikado” very well,
maintaining the very best stage traditions
of Japanese costume, landscape and house-
decoration ; and a big first-night audience
at His Majesty’s loudly proclaimed its appro-
val of the familiar melpdies. The kaleido-
. scopic pictures made up of gorgeous kirns
and gay fans, backed by lacquered pagodas
and cherry-trees abloom, were always effec-
tive and delightful. The three little giggling
maids from school (whore singing appa-
rently was not a compulsory subject) flut-
tered around in bright raiment, Yum Yum
wearing pink, Peep Bo azure blue, and
Pitti Sing lemon and gold; the trio made
a charming group. But the make characters
got the plums of the wardrobe. James Hay,
as Nanki Poo, sang of his shreds and patches
in white silk tights and a short coat of
striped blues over a crimson one. As the
Mikado’s long-lost chick, he faced his parent
in a flowing robe of white satin and maroon
velvet with seismographic wriggles in black.
Minnie Everett, as producer* added another
laurel wreath to her collection, and was
hauled out from the wings to take charge
of some pretty flowers when the floral-prize
distribution took place. Strella Wilson saw
the show from a managerial box.
Berwick echoed to the horn of the hunter
on Empire Day. A special train brought a
large consignment of gee-gees, maidens in the
attractive riding-kit of the moment, and men
in those scarlet coats which the English, who
wear them till they fade, call pink. About
150 huntresses and hunters dashed across
country in pursuit of Reynard, and the run
was followed by many motorists. After the
kill the Lionel Grimwades spread the tea-
cloth at their home and feasted many of the
hunters, the rest finding the four-o’clock
beverage at the railway-station. All the well-
known hunting families were represented,
numbering, of course, the Emblings. Mrs.
Dale and Ruth, Gwen Johnston and dad,
Joan Chirnside, Joan Nee/bigin and Mary
Bates. A. T. Creswick figured as master,
and Norman Wood as huntsman.
Seeking fresh worlds to conquer women
have commenced the invasion of men’s clubs.
Taking the line of least resistance they
1 licked on the Bohemian. There aren’t any
Bohemians nowadays, and the club that
flaunts such a title is naturally peopled by
folk who would be deeply shocked if they
met either male or female of the extinct
species. The women, about 45 of them, wear-
ing their gladdest rags and arrfied with com-
plexion-repair outfits, were invited to dine
one night last week, and afterwards there
was bridge. It has since been decided that
this sort of thing is to happen once a month.
Confirmed occupants of enormous chairs in
less enterprising clubs arc said to be getting
alarmed and talking bitterly about the thin
end of the wedge.
Members of the Alliance Franeaise met in
the black-and-gold room of Cocker ton’s to
dine and dance and welcome the newly-
arrived Vice-Consul for France, Monsieur
Bourguin, who takes over the reins here
during the absence of the Consul. The Con-
sul for Belgium, Rene Vanderkelen, and P.
Frossard, of Switzerland, were there with
their respective wives; Mrs. Vanderkelen
in a simple gown of dull black satin, and
the Frossard Madame in tissue of varied
hues lined with jade green. The two sisters
of the Alliance’s secretary, M. Kerry, were
attractively clad in black velvet and lace.
Cliastleton, a Toorak mansion hencefor-
ward to be devoted to the purposes of public
entertainment, commenced its new mission
by housing a dance and card-party for the
Children’s Hospital. The house formerly
was the home of “Barrett,- the maltster,”
but the scarcity of servants has driven the
family from the old fireside. Several of the
younger set ran the party and made it not
only fashionable but a financial success.
Aimee Shackell and Jean Lawrence, the
latter a glow in soft pink and silver, were
ticket-secretaries, and Kathleen Currie, a
study in pink with a shower of petals about
the liem-line, looked after the treasury.
Nancy Irvine, daughter of the Lieut.-Gov.,
showing a glimmer of silver beneath beaded
apparel, was prominent in a band of helpers
that included Helen Lempriere, in flouncings
of flame hue floating from an anchorage of
silver tissue; Marney Clarke, in naiad-like
drapery of green ; and Mary Winter-Irving,
in a frock of rose tone.
The Stage went to the rescue of the Church
when principals of the “Mercenary Mary”
co. helped to entertain the guests at a tea-
drinking, with bridge, at the Oriental for the
parish church of Deepdene. Florence
Hunter, whose frock featured the up-to-date
combination of black, green and gold with
headpiece of black felt, sang, and Mai Bacon
appeared with success in the role of auc-
tioneer, dressing the part in black with
incrustation of red leather. The affair was
engineered by Doris Winter, who wore
Quaker-like apparel of grey with touches of
white, and Patricia O’Day, who appeared in
a smart frock of myrtle green cloth with
beige-liued collar aud cuffs and millinery
in tune.
Members of the Women’s Automobile Club
parked their cars at headquarters the other
evening and indulged in a rubber or two of
bridge. The tables were seasonably titi-
vated with mauve chrysanthemums and gum
foliage. The president being a ’flu victim,
secretary Mrs. H. G. Pattinson, in a steel-
beaded gown, and the fair-haired Mrs.
Maurice Patkin, in chenille embossed in
many colors, crankc-d up the function.
This maiden snugly clad against wintry
breezes is Maisie Bennett, who is to play the
1 itle - role in
“The Bride of
Gospel Place,”
by Louis
Esson, which
will have its
premiere at
the Playhouse
on June 9.
Though one of
the very
youngest of
the Pioneer
Players, she is
yet well known
in Repertory
roles, and has
handled with
success such
varied parts as
La d y Tun-
bridge in “The
Young Person
in Pink,” Mrs.
Alv i n g i n
Ibsen’s “Ghosts.” and Daisy Odiham in Gals-
worthy’s “The Show.” The Dickinson-
Monteath studio is responsible for the attrac-
tive picture.
Melbourne String Quartette's latest con-
cert at the Assembly Hall included a nice
performance of the Haydn I) Minor, a
really well-finished presentation of a compo-
sition by Louis Ilattenbach, and a very
spiritless and faulty version of Brahms’s
F Major Quintette, responsibility for which
was shared by pianist Edward Goll. It
looked as if Brahms had been sacrificed to
Hattenbach at rehearsals. The veteran
’cellist’s quartette was a neatly harmonised
piece of work with plenty of sentimental
melody of the sort beloved by those who
cuddle up to the second biggest fiddle. The
audience gave it a warm-hearted reception.
Players of the Repertory Theatre Society
gave a capital reading of Sean O'Casey’s
‘ Juno aud the Paycock” at No. 9 for the
benefit of the English-Speaking Union.
Juno’s miseries begin with a drunken, blas-
phemous idler of a husband “wid all the
airs of a Paycock.” Edith Appleton, as
Juno, and Irene Webb, as the daughter
who went astray, carried off the laurels
of the evening. Helton Daniel (who read
the part of the Paycoek’s bosom pal) after-
wards said a piece about the work of the
Society.
Professor Skeats took the chair at this
gathering, and Mrs. Skeats, who wore black
with relief in red and blue, extended a hand
to members. Mrs. Richard Gipps, who sec-
retaries the section of the E.S.U. respon-
sible for such performances, wore ivory satin
decorated with posies of varied hue and a
glint of gold. Mrs. Watson-Robertson had
grey lace over grey brocade, and Carrie
Haase was swathed in cream cliarmeuse.
Not many governesses have had the varied
and delightful experiences of an English visi-
tor, Miss Waddell, who last week showed her
water-color paintings in the rooms of the
Victoria League. These pictures, done with
the attention to detail of a miniaturist, de-
pict scenes in England and as far afield
as the Bosphorus. Miss Waddell for some
time lived in the palace of the Turkish heir-
apparent at Constantinople, where she
taught the royal offspring and initiated their
parents into some of the mysteries of Eng-
lish. For four years she taught the daugh-
ters of Sir Gerald du Maurier, and she has
happy memories of years spent in Belgium.
William James, the pianist who has won
recognition in his own land by the sheer
merit of his
contribution s
to the Toti
dal Monte
concerts, is
married to the
lady here
pictured in
pensive mood
by a Ruskin
camera. She
hails from the
Balkan pro-
vinces, and is
very proud of
her pure Slav
b i r t h. As
Saffo Av a, a
soprano vocal-
ist, she gradu-
ated from the
Milan Conser-
vatoire, carry-
ing off the
Verdi scholar-
ship. She has since appeared in opera, and
has filled musical comedy parts at the
Adelphi and Ambassadors Theatres in Lon-
don. As a child she sang before Roumania’s
musical and literary Queen Carmen Sylvia,
and has as a memento of the occasion a
diamond brooch with the Royal coat-of-arms.
A small son and daughter take up most of
her time at present, but she looks forward
to appearances on the concert platform in
an adopted land which she finds very friendly
and beautiful. )
The Gregor Woods, who come home by the
Malo’ja, ran across Grace Palotta in Paris
looking as smart as ever, wearing her grey
hair untinted and her face unpainted. The
lunched together at a little hotel in
Barbizon, where R. L. Stevenson put in
several years. Grace, these days, has her
home at Montreux, and had come to Paris
for a shopping week.
St. Albans, the famous Wilson racing-
stable, situated some miles out of Gee-
long. where .Tim Wilson and later W.R. used
to distribute hospitality and information to
a chosen few, has become the country home
of Mr. and Mrs. Raymond, who bought it
when they first came from N. S. Wales.
They moved in last week after a few neces-
sary renovations.
Not more than two months have elapsed
since Mrs. Hutton left her home at Kew and
took her nice daughter Lai to Hongkong.
Last week friends were advised of her daugh-
ter’s engagement; and this week they were
cabled that the wedding would take place in
Hongkong on the last Saturday in May.
The bride is the youngest daughter of the
late J. C. Hutton, and her bridegroom is
W. K. Reynolds.
Dorie Brown, who -went to England to
pursue her medical studies and became a
full-fledged M.D., was married at Bradford
to Lieut. Selwyn G. C. Rawson, R.N. The
bride is the youngest daughter of the late
Air. and Mrs. I). F. Brown, of this city.
Dora Wi,seller, who went east to become
Mrs. .T. Ryan, seems to inoculate girls who
go over a-visiting. All have returned leav-
ing their promise behind them. The last
one is already packing her suit-case for an
early wedding and a life in a plantation
shack. The Ryans, after roughing it at
Selangor, have moved on to Perak, a much
more comfy place. They’ve started a family.
Has woman’s tender heart gone the way of
discarded locks and the skirts that used to
swish the instep? Here is the Red Cross,
which lives at 42 Latrobc-street, Melbourne,
sending out an SOS for a few hundred
warm pull-over sweaters for sick soldiers.
The winter is here, and sweaters aren't.
Some of the women who have read this Page
have had a seance with the knitting-needles,
and their names arc blessfed, but more helpers
are urgently asked for.
Villers-Bretonneux showed that it hadn’t
forgotten its obligations to the Common-
wealth the other day, when the Mayor of
the pretty little town where Australian sol-
diers stemmed the German advance in 1918
convened a special meeting to discuss the bush-
fires in Gippsland. Only sympathy came out
of the proceedings “because of the lament-
able state in which the town still finds itself
as it struggles painfully to rise again from
the ruins of war” : but no doubt the sym-
pathy was genuine.
A four-act drama by Louis Esson, “The
Bride of Gospel Place,” will open the third
season of the Pioneer Players." The piece,
which deals with the life of the Melbourne
underworld, will be staged at the Playhouse
on June 9 under Leo Burke's direction, and
will be the 18th Australian work to be pre-
sented by the society. Further material has
been promised by Vance Palmer, Spencer
Brodney, Katharine Prichard, L. L. Woola-
cott, Gerald Byrne and Stewart Mackay, so
the mission of this patriotic organisation is
not likely to peter out.
There was some work in minor ways that
went almost unnoticed in connection with
the terrible Caulfield train disaster. , A
fruit-seller, with his stall outside the Caul-
field station, shut up shop immediately and
converted his cart into a temporary ambu-
lance. A fine 12-year-old boy volunteered his
assistance, to an ambulance-bearer, and not
only carried out the injured but sat with
them in the ambulance when they were taken
to the hospital. He had no first-aid know-
ledge, but he had grit, and the human sym-
pathy which turned him into a tender, useful
assistant.
Australia lost a good son and a fine fiddler
when Dick Jackson, of Melbourne, died at
Kobe, Japan, last month : his mother got the
bad news the week he was expected home.
He was only 34, and in his youth was Stef-
fani’s most adored pupil.
Twenty ex-presidents of the Vic. State
Teachers’ Union, at a crowded valedictory
at Anzac House, were honored by a hallful
of enthusiastic present-day dominies. Presi-
dent Stewart presented an inscribed medal-
lion to each veteran. Major Robin, who
presided over the destinies of the peds. in
the troublous days of 30 years ago. responded
for the lot; and things went with a swing
which spoke volumes for the gratitude of
the teachers of 3926 for the labors of the
men who stood at the helm in the last
generation.
Frank Tate, Director of Education, after
a strenuous year’s toil, which included steer-
ing the Superannuation and Teachers’ Bills
through Parliament, suffered a partial col-
lapse, which was intensified by an organis-
ing rush through the country districts. He
called in Dr. Frank Tate, who ordered his
protesting parent to bed for a fortnight. The
director pleaded the urgency of office work;
but the son replied: “You cannot play with
this neuritis. Lay up for 14 days at least!"
And. quoting something from his favorite
Shakspeare concerning a serpent’s tooth
and an ungrateful child, the father turned
liis face to the wall.
Dr. Gavin McCallum, who was one of our
representatives at the International Congress
of Surgeons at Rome, has, with Mrs. Gavin,
arrived in London ready for a little recrea-
tion. Their stay in Rome was not lacking
a thrill, since they had tea and talk with
Mussolini on several occasions, and were
close at hand when he became a target for
a demented woman.
Sister Adelaide’s busy week-
It has been a week of concerts —the Orpheus
Society, Richard Watson’s benefit (with him at his
best, and Toti dal Monte and her company to listen
to him) and Dal Monte’s own concerts in the Town-
Hall. For her first she was all flame and silver,
with a froth of ostrich feathei's to border her scarf
and • a bandeau of dull silver leaves in her hair.
Illness kept away Lady Bridges, who misses few
concerts; but her daughter was there with a party
that included the mayoral Bruces’ daughter, Legh
Vi user and Captain Brooke. The songstress tea-ed
with Lyceum Club members one morning.
Girl Guides have had a week out, with Miss
Behrens to lead them, Lady Bridges an all-day visitor
at the Brighton camp, and her daughter as one of
the campers. From Brighton Miss Behrens will go
to the Lakes, where she will have as her hostess
Mrs. Keith Bowman, one of the hardest workers
for the movement in this State.
The Babies’ Hospital, at its 13th annual meet-
ing, announced a total of nearly 400 cases for the
year, with 61 deaths —nine mothers out of ten wait
till their offspring are in extremis before taking
them to the hospital. A new nurses’ wing will
clear the way for accommodation for 40 more babies.
Mrs. H. C. Cave takes the place of Mrs. Teesdale
Smith on the committee.
The committee of the" Lady Victoria Buxton Girls’
Club, headed by Mrs. Charles and Lorna Todd, has
in hand over £lOOO of the £5OOO needed for its
new premises. In its 2S years the club has done
incalculable good in providing a home and a meet-
ing place for girls who otherwise would have been
literally homeless and friendless, and in the whole
of -that time its devoted matron, Miss Mills, has
refused to accept a. penny of salary. With an
example like that to stimulate them it's up to the
public to open its purse.
There was a mayoral reception for the English
University debaters, shorn of two of the guests by
the inconsiderate attentions of ’flu. They have
dined at the Robert Ifomburgs’, too, with half a
dozen damsels to meet them.

Let a British' Car reflect your pride of ownership.
FOR the first time in history the journey
from CAPE to CAIRO has been
accomplished by motor-car. Once
again the apparently impossible has been
achieved by CROSSLEY CARS. No other
car in the world has ever completed this
gigantic task. Thirteen thousand miles through
unknown country where no roads exist, through
veritable seas of mud, across rivers and over
the desert. More than once the cars were-
completely submerged, but the journey always
went on to its final triumphant conclusion.
1 his is the kind of service all Crossley Cars are
built to give. They succeed where other cars
fail. In this Cape-to-Cairo journey they have
demonstrated again their extraordinary quality,
their soundness of design, and their strength.
All Crossley Cars are built to one standard—
the highest. Whether you are interested in
the popular 15-30-h.p. (R.A.C. Rating 15.6)
from £495, or the 19.6 (the car which broke

NOTIONS
The fl totalisator at Adelaide’s Victoria
Park declared’ some stunning dividends on the first
day of the A.R.C.’s Birthday Cup meeting. \\. B.
Carr’s Peace Dove started the good work by returning
the tidy sum of £ll 25.; and then in succession
came £25 13s. on Royal Aides in the Adelaide
Stakes; £9 10s. on Golden Form in the Steeple;
£22 6s. on Rerlacre in the City Handicap; £BO
2s. on Sherwood Beau in the Toorak Welter, and
£l6 3s. on Frances Tressady in the Parkside Stakes.
In each race a second dividend was paid (it was
split in the Welter, there being a dead-heat for
second) ; and MeShortodds wouldn’t lay , those prices
in a hundred years. Redacre, -whose win was worth
£7OO to K. D. Bowman, besides what he collected
from the tote, is a four-year-old gelding by Denacre,
who won the City Handicap himself in 1922 and 19 -i 3,
out of Cerise and Green. He is nothing much to look
at, but he left the barrier smartly and was never
headed, Cash Box and Mentellini being- the closest
of his 16 opponents at the finish. Neville Percival,
the Perth jockey, had the mount, and won on Royal
Aides and Sherwood Beau as well.
* * * *
The Sydney bookmaker, who bought Fuji-
san after the A.J.C. Easter meeting got his money
back on Saturday, when the leggy Valais—Lady San
bay won the Queensland Turf Club’s King s 1 late
at Ascot. Though doubts were expressed as to whether
Fujisan could) go a mile and a quarter, he went out
solid at 5 to 4 on and came home on the bit in
2min. sjsec. Shrapnel was second favorite, but the
Queensland horses Lady Shepherd and Tabragalba
filled the minor places. T. M. Ahern’s Highfield
Regulator gelding Highland repeated his 1925 success
in the Stradbroke Handicap, for which he was backed
for a big stake down to 9 to 2 ; the outsider Dalcyse
and Fair Exchange were second and third respectively
and the six furlongs were left behind in lmin. 13sec.
Pike rode Fujisan and Highland, but failed to get
Mingelo (6 to 4) home in the Hamilton Handicap,
that awkward customer going under to imported
Heloise (5 to -1), and Albius. Another hot favorite
in Wee Glen (5 to 2 on) was vanquished, after a
great finish, by Piastoon in the St. Leger, Sydney-
trained Sum King being third. Piastoon is _ a son
of the 1912 Melbourne Cup winner Piastre, who has
done well at the stud with the limited chances which
Australian-bred stallions, with very few excep-
tions, get.

Those who went to Moonee Valley (Vic.)
on Saturday with the Grand Nationals in mind were
impressed by the form of Shanti (4 to 1) in the
Federal Hurdle. As- on the previous _ Saturday,
Autrolite was a short-priced favorite, and six furlongs
from home he was out 12 lengths, but Shanti finished
in great style and beat him by six lengths, with
Kingmaker 10 lengths behind Autrolite. Shanti, who
is by Sea Prince—Tuning Fork, was not of much
account on the flat, but looks like. tui ning out a
really good hurdler. He has 9st. 6lb. in the Rational.
Claude Grice’s Blackstone gelding Master Mariner
was a hot favorite for the Commonwealth Steeple,
but came a “purler” at the second fence, and the
grey gelding Mandleman (10 to 1), jumping beauti-
fully throughout, ran home an easy ryinner from
Needlework (6 to 1) and Namera. The V.R.C.
handicapper has raised Mandelman only 21b., to
9st 91b. in the G. N. Steeple. The seven starters
for’ the Mt. Alexander Handicap, 12 furlongs, were
an ordinary lot. The Woorak—Perdita gelding Olola
(7 to 4) on whom Cairns rode a beautiful race, just
got there from Janotmigne and Imitator. He was
the only favorite to win.
'* * * *
Fancying that a mile and a quarter would
bother a' horse who had succeeded at six furlongs
a week before, MeShortodds incautiously yelled Ten
to one Egerton” when betting opened on the Moore-
field Handicap at Kogarah (N.S.W.). Jimmy Barden
and his followers piled the money on until the
price was reduced by half, and, ridden by another
of Barden’s smart apprentices, the upstanding son of
Sir Dighton—Marqaet won all the way, Hinchmbrook
and Inia’s Boy following him to the judges box.
MeShortodds lost on that race, but he had his familiar
skinner in the Flying Handicap (a regular pitfall
for punters this season ac Moorefield), Factor (Repu-
tation-Oinnamon) bobbing up at 25 to no takers,
and returning £3 5 Bs. lor o“ 1 , ..v t
paid two other divs. And Sir Felix (1 * xVolter

If The Governor is as good as Melbourne
judges say he is, he ought to be a fair thing
the A.J.C. Hurdle at Randwick next Monday. He
has lOst. in the Randwick event, 2lb less “an in
the V.R.C. Grand National, so he must be reckoned
well treated, as the Flemington handicaps are on
a lower scale. Piratic (list.) and Kenwoo •• •
81b.) may be his most troublesome opponents on the
A.J.C. course and Honan and Bunting Wallace should
be handy in flat races during the meeting.
* * * *
Few Newcastle punters- had gains to set
against their coal strike losses after the Cup meeting.
Most of the races wait to outsiders, and all
doubles crashed when The Epicure (33 to 1), dis-
carded as worthless long after his victory m the
1923 Doncaster Handicap, won the Newcastle Mue
from Unumgar and Pennyform. Then Donald (25
to 1), who had failed in the Mile, collected the
Newcastle Cup, with Lady Lizzie second and old
Pennybont third. Donald, who won at Randwick
last month, is pretty good, but perhaps the best
galloper at Newcastle was the three-year-old Mag-
oona (Magpie—Earloona), who was successful each
day. Unfortunately he is short of an eye, so his
racing will be restricted to Newcastle and the few
other parts of Australia where one-eyed competitors
are not ruled out.
* # * *
“Hasen”: The compulsion placed by regis-
tered Melbourne race clubs on bookmakers to lay both
straight-out and for a place, if so requested, is not m
force on associated courses. But it seems that some
associated fielders have dared to follow the dreadtul
practice, to the horrified disgust of their kind.
Says Melbourne Sun of the last Ascot (unregistered)
meeting:—
“Two bookmakers have continued to accept each-way
wagers from backers. The popularity of this method
of wagering gave these fielders, it is claimed, an
unfair advantage over the straight-out ringmen, and
a deputation [of bookmakers] asked the management
to prevent the win-and-place men from operating,
The request was granted and bookmakers resumed
operations on a straight-out basis.”
Apparently, no one at the pleasant little gathering
thought it worth while to consider the matter of the
“unfair” disadvantage to punters. But the place-
betting sharks, who offer evens a place or worse
about an 8-to-l straight-out chance, must have given
a mild huzza.
* * * *
“Gilroden”: At a down-the-line meeting
in Melbourne an unobtrusive punter, on handing up
his ticket for collection, had £6O counted out to
him before he fully realised what was happening.
Sadly he pushed it back with “This isn t mine,,
I only had a quid on Roughasbags at five to one.
HE RECOVERED.
RUGBY CAPTAIN : “I [?]ol y’ t' drop that three-quarter.
FORWARD: “Well, didn’ I?”
R.C.: “Yeh, but th' cow's up again!”
There was a hurried consultation; then McShort-
odds grabbed one hand and his offsider the other
while they gurgled such words as white man,
“dinkum sport” and “a gen’l’man, Bill, a genlman.
But I lingered and heard what they said when
the honest man was out of sight. It began: Well,
of all the ruddy mugs”....
* * * *
“Hotham”: The proposed betting-tax in
Britain has brought down a barrage of objections
from gamblers and wowsers. Mostly it is on lines
familiar enough in Victoria when a Tote Bill
threatens; but a new note is struck occasionally.
One of these, in an article in the Nineteenth
Century, deals it out to the tote, which it calls a
miraculous scientific invention” used m the Aus-
tralian colonies.” This “reduces gambling to the
level of mental deficients, and brings betting within
the powers of the inmates of the lunatic asylum.
All you have to do is to buy a ticket with ( the
name of your fancy on it ' from a clerk, and put
it in a slot in the machine.” This, by some mys-
terious process of the higher mathematics, at once
announces to the onlookers the total amount staked,
the odds, and everything else that has gone into
the machine.” A vivid description, but in his
haste the observer overlooked the apparatus foi
exuding the dinkum oil which is necessary before
a ticket can be purchased,
* * * *
Competing in the Walker Whisky Stakes
at Liverpool (N.S.W.), Buckley’s bitch Black Bess
inflicted a defeat (his first) on Happy Batchelor.
But digging in to get round on the turns she tore
off a toe-nail, and it was a very sore-footed grey-
hound that limped to slips to oppose Two Ones m
the semi-final. She forgot her injury when the
hare was released and Two Ones never scored. In
a long lead to the hare in the final Connie, who had
conquered Eyeshade, the Vic. Derby winner, hung
to her opponent like a coat of glue, but approach-
ing the hurrying quarry Bess drew out, led a bare
length, got the better of the exchanges and the
flag. In the Sires’ Produce Stakes, 5 to 2 was the
biggest risk the books were prepared to take about
Bit of Cheek, Buckley’s representative. She sur-
vived till the semi-final against Sea Mark (25 to 1
at card-call and 6 to 1 in the course). The outsider
then ended a series of brilliant courses by outing
the second favorite, Good Kick. The storm of howls
that greeted Judge Scully’s decision in the Fire-Bit
of Cheek course nearly blew him out of the saddle.
Yet it was transparently correct. The crowd was'
deceived by pocket bias and the angle of view.
• * *
Bookmakers are bad judges of a fighting
man, and when it was announced that a Sydney
penciller had brought one Teddy Seidman from the
U.S. and matched him with Ignacio Fernandez,
guaranteeing the Filipino £2OO, thick-eared punters
deemed it a good opportunity to get a bit of their
own back. Seidman scaled Bst. llAlb. to the Manila-
man’s Bst. 81b. when the pair shook hands at the
Stadium on Saturday night, but the thick-eared
brotherhood cheerfully laid 4 to 1 on Ignacio, and
the money was always theirs. The short-armed
Seidman was out-reached, out-boxed and out-classed.
Fernandez jolted the face off him with left jabs,
and Teddy’s right cross was too slow to have caught
a tortoise, let alone the panther-like Filipino. In
the fourth the American created shrieks of merri-
ment by suddenly leaping in the air and stamping
stormily before the foe. Fernandez smiled sadly and
smote him on the port lamp right in the middle of
his Cherokee schottische. Teddy’s only asset was his
gameness. He was floored several times and was
twice carried to his corner, but though a bleeding
wreck at the end of the 12th he was stoically
preparing to take more punishment when Wallis,
after a parley, pointed to Fernandez as “The winner,
gentlemen!” The poor attendance was another com-
mentary on the folly of the aforesaid bookmaker
and the bad policy of matching two aliens.

Martin Ludecke (12st. Bflb.), a Swiss
grappler who came to this country by way of Panama,
made a successful Australian debut by defeating Billy
Meeske (12st. 13f1b.) at the Melbourne Stadium.
Meeske gained first fall in the third round by a
perfectly applied body press, but was severely tossed
in the following session, as the result of a crutch
hold, and was rocky when he resumed. He was
pinned again in the seventh by a combination scissors
and body press, and a lot of people left the Stadium
vowing that they would back Ludecke against the
best of the Yanks due in Melbourne shortly. Still
the man who bets on a wrestling match is a mug.

The Vic. League tribunal disqualified
several offenders last week, three of them Collingwood
men. But the ’Woods-
men have a second 18
almost as good as the
first, and, visiting Gee-
long on Saturday, they
gave the premiers a
doing, having 75 points
to Geelong’s 44 in the
third quarter and 75
to 68 at the end; Gee-
long played finely in
the last term. Most
of the 30,000 at the
M.C.C. ground expected
t o see the Richmond
Tigers demolish the
Melbourne Fuchsias,
but on the day the
Tigers were mere pussy-
cats, and Melbourne
scored 122 points to
their 89, Davie, Mel-
bourne’s smart forward,
booting nine goals, St.
Kijda, having licked
South Melbourne and
Fitzroy and almost
beaten Geelong, had
great hopes of downing
Gssendon, but found the
job one for a far better
team: ’Don, 85; St.
Kilda, 38. ’Roy man-
aged to beat Carlton,
5,8 points to 48 ; South
Melbourne got home
from North Melbourne
by the skin of its
teeth and 2 points—
-75 to 73; and ’Scray
pulverised Hawthorn,
100 to 67.
The sixth round of Sydney League foot-
ball gained interest in being the final flutter before
the selection of the team to meet Queensland at the
Cricket Ground on Saturday next. The South
Sydney-Western Suburbs game was accounted an
easy thing for South, but the premiers had to go
all out ta win by 15 points to 2, West’s superiority
in getting the ball from the scrums keeping the
clever South Sydney backs from developing their
attack till late in the day. Glebe, a greatly lm-
proved team, beat Eastern Suburbs by 19 to o,
Toohey, the winger, scoring 13 of his side’s points;
Newtown vanquished St. George by 23 to 12, anc.
Uni. met unexpectedly stiff opposition from the
weak North Sydney side, but got home by 21 to 18.
In the Union game, the defeat of Randwick by
Western Suburbs was not anticipated, especially by
Randwick, but the Westerners won well by 18 to 8.
Randwick’s forwards again showed disinclination for
the hard work in pack and ruck, and the speedy backs
got few openings. University, with Ross in magnifi-
cerit form at full-back, defeated Eastern Suburbs by
17 to 11, and Glebe-Balmain was hard pressed by
North Sydney, ending with 22 to 17. Wilson, the
North Sydney half, played a remarkable game, and
outshone A. C. Wallace, who had an off day, particu-
larly in defence. Manly’s solid forwards proved too
stiff a hurdle for the lightweight Y.M.G.A., as the
Villagers’ victory by 28 to 8 indicates. The Soccer
folk had something of a record week-end, four of
their five games being drawn. The one win was
emphatic enough, Bajgownie overcoming Eastern
Suburbs by four goals to nil. Among the Australian-
rulers, Western Suburbs retained their unbeaten lead
by outing Newtown, 9 goals 11 behinds to 6—B.
“Past" Grammar’’: An English cable indicates that
better times may shortly dawn for “colonial” ex-
ponents of the Rugby I.eague game. For some
years after the visit of Baskerville’s Australasian team
to England Aussies and Maorilanders, including some
of the original All Blacks, -held fat jobs in the
Northern Union clubs of Lancashire and Yorkshire.
Then it was laid down that a “colonial” would have
to live two years in Britain before being allowe"d
to play with a Northern Union club, and the Aus
tralian League authorities, anxious to keep their
men at home, reciprocated. Now Wigan has asked
that the two-years’ qualification rule be abolished.
As 16 other clubs have endorsed the request, the
rule will probably go, and League stars on this
side will be prepared to consider offers for their
valuable services. ,
“Centurion”: The Rugby Union promises to turn
out a remarkable back team against the Maorilanders.
Ross, the Uni. full-back, who performed so finely
against the All Blacks in Sydney last year, is a
certainty for his possie. To the three-quarter line
which did so well beyond the Tasman —Crossman,
Reid, Morrissey and Bowers —A. C. Wallace may be
added, while Palmer, the Glebe winger, promises
additional fleetness. Tom Lawton will be available
for the five-eighth position; in fact, half-back is
the only place lacking a star candidate. All the
foregoing, save Crossman, are solid enough for any-
thing M.L. can offer. The Union selectors have
made it plain that they are looking for kill-’em-and-
eat-’em forwards. Piano-players and ladies’ maids
are not desired.
* # * #
“Kir”: “FY7’s” reference to barefooted
toeballers (B. 13/5/’26) recalls a long-ago Rugby
game in out-back N.S.W. A belated player, arriving
dressed for the fray, jumped off his panting steed
and took his place as a front-row man in the scrum.
He swung for the ball, and agonising yells came
from the opposing centre-forward. lir his haste the
late-comer had forgotten to remove his spurs.
After registering their second victory of
the tour at the expense of Oxford, by an innings
and 13 runs, the Australians tackled a South of
England side at Bristol, which is a wetter place than
most in a rainy season. The match was regarded
by some critics as of more than ordinary importance,
a sort of trial canter, as it were, for several English
“probables” and “possibles” in the Test matches.
And certainly several of both were there. Sandham,
Hendren and Strudwick are all well in the run-
ning, and the stock of Parker, Gloucester-
shire’s left-hand bowler, who regularly takes his
200 wickets every season, has been appreciating ot
late. But playing Strudwick and Parker, as well
as Tate and Macaulay, would give England such a
depressing batting tail that the selectors are more
likely to look round for a wicketkeeper who can make
a few runs, such as Lyon, Smith or Whysall, and a
change bowler who can score as well as take wickets, like
Kilner of Yorkshire. Chapman, the dashing hitter,
improved his chance of international honors, but
Fender didn’t, and Gibson, who was out here with
Maclaren’s team and who has been lost to cricket
of late years in the Argentine, failed to scintillate.
Of the game it may be said that the Australians,
after dismissing their opponents cheaply enough, made
a poor batting show themselves till half the side
were out. Then they found two men to do all that
was wanted, as they have never yet failed to find
them at need. The South made 211, with Chapman
compiling 89 merrily, Hendren 62 more stodgili
than is his wont, and the Jam’s wristy nephew _-8.
Macartney, with 4 for 41, and Gregory, with 3 tor
40 bowled best. Of the visitors’ opening batsmen
only Woodfull (69) did himself justice, and when
Andrews partnered Ryder with 6 wickets down toi'
151 the scratch side must have been feeling fairly
cheerful But it was Ryder’s and Andrews turn
to “knock the cover off,” a task which they per-
formed with great thoroughness, adding 1/7 and
both remaining n. 0., the Victorian with 108 and
the N. S. Welshman with 74. This left the side
in an unassailable position, and as rain prevented
any play on the Friday, it stayed there. It really
looks as if it would be difficult to over-estimate this
team’s batting strength, for of nine men anyone
may make 100, and down to the 11th 50-Would Me
no surprise. That is, perhaps, against any bowling
but'the very best England can find. The problem
that at present faces England is that, to find a really
strong bowling side, the batting will have to be
sacrificed.
There were some more batting pyrotechnics against
Middlesex when -Collins resumed his habit of toss-
winning. It wasi perhaps the first shirt-front wicket
the Aussies have sampled, and they took full advantage
of it piling up 489. Bardsley made his best score
so far with 70, Collins replied effectively to the
detractors who were beginning to suggest that he
might consider dropping himself for the first lest,
bv getting within one of the century, and Andrews,
164 is described as “the best knock of the tour.
If Tommy started poorly, he is coming with a rush
now. Macartney and Gregory helped with 44 and
45 n.o Queerly enough, even against this welter
of runs there was one outstanding bowling per-
formance, that of Allen, the Sydney-born Eton-and-
Cambridge fast bowler, who had already been picked
for England v. The Rest. He could capture no
wickets the first day, but he carried all before him
on the second, getting Andrews caught at short-leg
and clean-bowling Ryder, Oldfield, Gnmmett and
Everett in rapid succession. Clearly the English
selectors mean to have at least one fast bowler in
the Tests, and the youthful Allen looks the likeliest
to fill the bill at present. He seems to have the
no-ball habit as markedly as Scott for he bowlea
six of them in taking his five wickets for 65. After
a life at 2, Stevens made a century for Middlesex,
but a draw was the best the side could hope for on
Tuesday morning wdtli 6 doWn for 233.
“Centurion”: Dr. “Robbie” Macdonald, who, as
lion sec of the Leicester county club, entertained the
Australian XI, is a Queenslander from Brisbane. A
dentist by profession, he has devoted most of his
existence to cricket, which, since his Brisbane
Grammar School days, he has regarded as a worship-
ful mystery rather than a mere game. Even when
lie went after an American degree he chose Philadel-
phia, because cricket is played in that city. A very
correct if slow, batsman, Mac. did Queensland good
service in inter-State and other big games, and by
sheer force of will converted himself from the most
incapable of fieldsmen into a really good one. In
later years he settled in Leicester, and played for
several seasons in the county XI, of which he is
now the guiding official.
THIS ONLY WAY.

The Australasian Journalist, a maga-
zine of which the general public knows little
because it circulates almost exclusively among
the 1700 members of the A.J.A., will in
future appear twice a month instead of once,
Sid Pratt, general secretary of the A.J.A.
will continue as its editor.
R. W. Kenderdine, who for three years was
general president of the A.J.A., has been
presented by the organisation with a few
knick-knacks in appreciation of his sterling
efforts for the men and women of the craft.
Kenderdine will go to Canberra next year
with the Federal Hansard staff.
Brian C. Fitzpatrick, a young man who
is well known to readers of .The Bulletin.
has packed his bag for England, where he
proposes to storm Fleet-street. Fitzpatrick
is one of the literary giants of Melbourne
Uni., who varies the writing of learned dis-
quisitions by recording the ’Varsity news for
the Age.
“Steele Rudd” (Arthur Hoey Davis) is
again an editor. He is conducting the Shop-
Assistants’ Magazine, a production which
declares that, while it is not the official
union organ, its policy is to economically
and industrially assist the 50,000 shop-assist-
ants in N. S. Wales, and at the same time
to further the interests of employers. Th<-
announcement that deserves a special cheer
is that it is looking (and paying) for work
by old and new Australian writers. The
price is sixpence, and there’s a story by
Steele Rudd in every iksue.
“Harold Hardupp”: W. G. Conley, gen-
eral manager of the S. M. Herald, got a
seat at an official luncheon a while ago beside
a bespectacled man who could hardly see
his plate, even with his glasses, and was
likewise deaf. Getting into the discussion
of newspapers, he deplored the use of small
type. “How do you like, the type in the
Herald?” asked Conley, always keen to
“feel” his public. The deaf man inclined
his eair attentively, and then looked sharply
round. “Well, I’m surprised to hear you
say it, Mr. Conley,” he said, "but of course
it is tripe!”
“Chip” : Zaue Grey’s trip to Australia has
only been deferred. I have word from him
that he will be here next year. Personally
I doubt whether his M.L. impressions will
inspire a work of fiction, for practically all
his time was spent in sport. But when
speculating on what he is likely to write
about us or anyone else, it should be remem-
bered that he is the author of “The Vanish-
ing American,” a book of permanent value,
as well as all his wild and woolly western
yarns. For all his popularity, Grey does
not court publicity, and only desires to be
let alone to follow his sporting tastes.
"Cascade : Tom Clark, who is leaving
the assistant-editorship of Melbourne Herald
to become managing-editor of London Daily
News, is taking with him Max Murray as
descriptive writer. Murray is the, young
man who left the Herald ' and worked his
way around the world on a windjammer with
five bob and a typewriter. The story still
lingers that when he re-appeared in Mel-
bourne Keith Murdoch and Tom Clark, both
fond of stunting, fought Theodore Fink for
the honor of offering him the good job he is
leaving. With him goes Mrs. Murray, re-
cently Miss Dougal and the kiddies’ “Mar-
gery Daw.”
"Tlomfrey Beale”: Died the other day at
St. Peters, Sydney, Alexander McKenzie
( ameron. He left Scotland at an early age
with a sound education and saxpence, and
worked his way round the world by editing-
newspapers, grafting on cattle-boats, mining
and anything else that came his way. About
40 years ago lie took over the now-defunct
Valgett (N.S.W.) News, and steered it for
a decade along a path intermittently rocky.
When the N. S, Wales land scandals were
at their zenith he carried the fiery cross of
exposure through a great part of the State
—dealing especially with the exploitation of
the ’Ol Act—and paying his own expenses.
His hobby was astronomy, and he published
several books on the subject.
"Retired Volt”: Queer telegrams? This
story is true, if tragic. A talkative tourist
had returned from Japan with the blinding
information that several millions of the
population were registered ladies of wheezy
virtue. The. Sydney press-agent, hard up
for topics, included this lush bit of news
in his last message for the day across the
Tasman, and the bored Australian cable-
clerk, after sending it. added in parenthesis:
“Burns-Philp arranging special excursion
steamers immediately.” A sleepy operator
in Maoriland wrote it all down, and handed
it over, and it was duly distributed to the
associated press of the Shaky Islands. One
provincial paper even printed it. Result,
for an offence against public morality and
decency, ride regulations, the Sydney' clerk
was sacked, and for omitting to count a
message before delivery the M.L. lad was
degraded. Both dashed good operators, too.
I knew them.
“Sixenate”: The publicity man, as we
know him, is a modern development, scarcely
two decades old; but he is pushing into
everything. A recent, lawsuit in Egypt shows
that one of him was hired to heip change
the form of government there. He was an
American named Folk, who was offered by
Zaghlul Pasha 5000 dollars a month to run
an Egyptian independence publicity cam-
paign, with £lOO,OOO in the event of success.
Folk died, and his widow declares that,
Egypt having become a sovereign and inde-
pendent State, Zaghlul owes her, as her hus-
band’s executrix. £120,000 for the crossword
puzzles, slogans, missing-word competitions
and other details of modern publicity work
which were no doubt employed in the great
cause. It seems mean of Zaghlul to haggle
over the amount, but probably be meant by
independence a political condition in which
he could thrust his hand freely into the trea-
sury, and pay such trifling accounts without
feeling the drain personally.

Australian audiences, though prone to
hearty applause, sometimes decorated with
“Encore!” have become curiously decorous
in their methods of showing pleasure; the
turbulent shouts which poured down to the
performers at the end of the “Totem Tom
Tom” song-ballet at Sydney Majesty’s on
Saturday were like a breath from the old
days. “Totem Tom Tom” in itself is suffi-
cient to make “Rose Marie” a success. The
evolutions of 48 ladies of the chorus, each
one bizarrely costumed to represent a totem
pole, are artistically designed, working up
to dazzling “pictures” with humor in them.
It is, indeed, the sumptuous circumstance of
“Rose Marie,” upon which the Williamson
management claims to have more
money than upon any other production to
date that is its highest recommendation,
although the music of Rudolf Frimi and
Herbert Stothart is also good. There are
two acts, each divided into five .“scenes,’’
some of them described as “impressions.”
In one of these—a group of men sitting round
a campfire, the limelight thrown upon them
through a transparent front cloth —the sense
of surrounding foggy darkness is well con-
veyed, and is helped by the voices of people
unseen who speak out of the darkness. A
murder scene played in pantomime, with
music from the orchestra in excited staccato,
is another innovation which works well;
and the two biggest scenes, the Totem Pole
Lodge, Kootenay Pass, with its perspective
of rugged mountain, and the ballroom at
Chateau Frontenac, Quebec, are finely done.
The action might have been made to finish
in the climax in the ballroom; the scenes
that follow are mere stage-pictures, artisti-
cally worth while, but slackening the high
note of popular approval on the curtain-fall.

and Oscar Hammersteiu decided that the

melodramatic plot is the thing that least
matters, and kept only enough of it to string
the ballets and songs on. It is early appa-
rent that Harriet Bennet has no middle
register in her art; she veers from pathetic
grief to smiling charm. But her Bose
Marie is an appealing part, although she
played it with a distracting French
accent; and with Reginald Dandy (Jim Ken-
yon), who was robustly successful, she made
of the “Indian Love Gall” one of the items
that roused the packed» audience to those
vociferous shouts already noted. But there
is a touch of incongruity here and there—
as in her appearance in a sleeveless light silk
frock in a scene wherein the other characters
are muffled in furs and scarves. Stephanie
Deste, nearly naked in one of her appear-
ances, put a lot of fire into Wanda, the
Indian girl. Frederick Bentley, who had the
job of serving humor which was very tame
in spots, with the best of it already made
familiar by vaudeville pirates, worked hard
as Hardboiled Herman without success until
the second act, when he scored well. Lou
Vernon, who has made rapid progress during
the last year, was one of the chief successes as
Emile La Flamme; and the others, who in-
cluded the deep-voiced George Bryant as the
Indian. Black Eagle, were adequate.

The Cossacks have gone; will we hear them again
In songs of the Volga and of the Ukraine?
They had baritones shaded and tenors in alt,
And a deep, rumbling bass like a voice from the vault;
They told us of robbers and men of the barge,
And on church themes and soldiers were wont to
enlarge.
They were bells, bayonets, vodka, viols and flutes,
And high-voltage dancers in tall Eussian boots.

The voice with which Toti dal Monte
charmed Australia a year ago will fill Syd-
ney Town Hall with melody and an applaud-
ing public on Saturday night—also on Tues-
day and Thursday next.
George Gee has established himself as a
favorite at Sydney Tivoli, and shares the
chief honors with ventriloquist Coram; but
there are several bright newcomers, of whom
the Ghezzis deserve mention as a pair who
have succeeded in putting something new
into an acrobatic turn; in fact, they don’t
show a single one of the stale old tricks.
Peggie Dawes and I-teg Glennie supply grace-
ful dances, and Brian Lawrance, “the Boy
from Eton,” has a voice that would bring
applause even if he wasn’t a cherub.

Arrived at Fuller’s Theatre (Sydney) on
Saturday, Hector St. Clair, whose pants fit
him in very few places, and who wears only
one eyebrow. After getting laughs by the
methods usually associated with such regalia
and indulging in some naughtinesses of the
nursery order, he produced a well-resined
fiddle and played like an angel. Rayna Car-
bette, who is of Russian extraction, sang
some ditties of British and American origin;
one with blue edges. Harold Walden scored
laughs with songs of a meditative character,
tastefully accompanied by himself on piano
or mandolin, and the four little Kellys
reached down into their repertoire and dug
up a charming little programme. Jim
Gerald’s revue, “Oh, Mum!” was marked
by some smart dressing, good singing and a
solid backbone of fun provided by Gerald
in a dame role.
# * H*
“Bluebeard’s Seven Wives,” now in Syd-
ney, is a picture with au appeal to people
who don’t like “the pitchers.” It is a satire
upon the fillums and their much-boosted
identities, providing uproarious comedy for
those who don’t care about the satire, but
more entertainment for those who do. Du
Val, who “makes stars as he needs them”
(he is obviously Cecil de Mille), picks up an
out-of-work bank-clerk, who is turned into
a film star after being transformed for pub-
licity purposes into Don Juan Hartez, a
Spanish nobleman, induced, at great ex-
pense, to consent to act for the screen. The
production of “Romeo and Juliet,” renamed
“Purple Passions,” in such a form that “mil-
lions saw it without suspecting that it was
adapted from a play by William Sliak-
speare,” is one of the ticklesome touches.
$
The fun is fast and fatuous in the screen
version of “What Happened to Jones,” the
old laughter-raiser first introduced to Aus-
tralia by the Willougliby-Geach co. The
Lyceum supports this with “His Majesty
Bunker Bean.” Hoyt’s provides heart-throbs,
served with the kind of exotic New York
scenery in which film-fans seem to revel, in
“The Best People,” a vulgar screen story
which gets some comedy from the marriage
of a society girl and her brother to a chauf-
feur and a chorus-girl, and in “Hell’s Four
Hundred.” “The Wanderer” continues to pack
’em at the Prince Edward. Another Aus-
tralian picture, “The Pioneers,” made by
Ray Longford, starts at the Lyceum _on
Saturday; and a further local production,
“Those Who Love,” is shortly to be given
a showing. It is the work of three sisters
who are daughters of Dr. J. M. McDonagli,
of Sydney. # # #
On Saturday “The Mikado,” accompanied
by an army which had anticipated the find-
ings of the disarmament conference in
“THE MIKADO,” AT MELBOURNE HIS
MAJESTY’S.
Pooh-Bah (Sydney Granville), Yum Yum (Patti Rus-
sell) and Pish-Tush (Lance Fairfax).
Europe, tramped upon His Majesty s stage
in Melbourne, and in the extremely capable
hands of Bernard Manning gave an interpre-
tation of his godhead that would have made
every samurai in Japan write letters to
the Tokio Times if he had seen it. Sydney
Granville, as Pooh-Bah, concentrated in his
person all the nepotism which, democratic
States now scatter through various depart-
ments; Charles Walenn, as the Lord High
Executioner, showed a reluctance to lop
heads, which is coming into fashion once
again; and James Hay, as a wistful Nanki
Poo, bestowed kisses (unimaginable insults
in Japan, where they are cut out of all
imported films) on the cheeks of Patti Rus-
sell as Yum Yum. Effie Armstrong and
Mabel Gibson were the rest of the trio of
Oriental butterflies; they fluttered accept-
ably, but failed to sing as richly as some
lepidoptera who have gone before them.
Strella Wilson, too tall and definitely pro-
portioned to be a butterfly, was absent and
missed. The Pish-Tish of Lance Fairfax
was the most harmoniously gifted of the
choir.
* * * *
Nippon, as interpreted by Minnie Everett
and the brothers Coleman, was a very high-
keyed landscape, as befitted an era when .the
only smoke in the air came from the pipes
of amiable philosophers; and the music
matched it. Sullivan set a fashion in Orien-
tal melody which has been a rather dreadful
burden since, and Gilbert fathered the de-
portment of a Chinese sanitary coolie on
his Japanese ladies; also the Japanese pot-
hooks exhibited on Saturday won’t be found
in any standard dictionary, nor should they
be read from bottom to top; and the skulls
of the male chorus failed to hide their
Nordic origin. But these were minor details
in a show as artlessly happy as a. kid’s first
picture-book, and as elegantly witty as an
Oxford Union debater. The only people who
took the giggle seriously on its first appear-
ance in London were the Japanese. If
there were any present at its - resuscitation
on Saturday they probably regretted that
their country could not be transmogrified
overnight into the gay little cosmos invented
by G. and S.

Melbourne entrepreneurs made this Page
a liar in two places last week by changing
their minds at the last minute, the official
explanation being intense Public Demand
for More. Frank Neil’s collection will, m
consequence, start asking “Are You a
Mason?” at the Palace, and the Kings will
tell “What Every Woman Knows,” on Satur-
day. “Leave it to Jane” replaces “The Bad
Man” at the Royal on that date too. At the
same time the Auditorium will be called
upon to find room for Percy Grainger, the
world-famous Australian pianist. A Colonial
Song” of his own composition will be a star
item. At the Princess “Mercenary Mary”
reigns as if for ever, although “Betty Lee
is believed to be rehearsing her coronation.
“The Best People” continue to bo blest at

Beresford Fowler’s Little Art Co. released
“The Wild Duck” at the Queen’s for
the first time in Melbourne on Saturday.
This specimen of peculiarly. Scandinavian
fauna reveals Ibsen in a comic mood: Hjal-
mar Ekdal has been compared to those his-
toric asses, Falstaff, Malvolio and Sanclm
Panza. Beresfdrd Fowler gave him thought-
lul treatment. Admirably strung together,
the piece is brisk of speech, and, although
the symbolism and the metaphysics dear to
this playwright’s psyche are present, they are
not allowed to trip up the action's sprinting
feet. Betty Rae, Ruth Connabere and Eric
Donald, among others, were satisfactorily
in the picture. June 7 will be another open
season for the bird.

Gautier’s canine bricklayers have left Mel-
bourne Tivoli, presumably in quest of a State
with a 44-liour week. Lee White and Clay
Smith remain the most important items in
a moderate bill. The lady’s drowsy charm
and the publicity of a long suit in bank-
ruptcy attract a sympathetic crowd, which
also has an inexhaustible reservoir of laughs
for the spectacle of “Mo,” in the Shaks-
pearean phrase, voiding his rheum on Bluett.
The frequency with which “Mo” performs
this insanitary piece of business suggests
either lack of imagination or excessive sali-
vation.

Melbourne Bijou has Win and Windle,
burlesque dancers, the (Harris family of
inveterate musicians, the Charleston demon-
strators and the cycling Brocks to make
up a fairly cheering evening; and the Moon
and Mprris revue co. has produced from
somewhere a couple of passable sketches to
fatten a rather attenuated second half. Still
the adiposity isn’t- equal to the late George
Reid at his best.

At Hoyt’s, Melbourne, this week, Pola
Negri, in “Flower of the Night,” has a mine
stolen from her and the vigilantes help her
to re-burgle it in an exciting manner. Those
who like lighting and a very frabjous woman
will flock to see this film. A quite close
approximation to Rider Haggard’s “She”
is being unrolled at the Majestic. The hoo-
doo connected with the mysterious lady had
an echo in real life, the American star
engaged to play the part fighting a lawsuit
with the British producer over it. The suc-

Poverty
Point
“Avon”: Percy Grainger, the American-
naturalised Australian-born pianist, comes
back now in the heyday of a reputa-
tion that is based in about equal parts on
exceptional pianistic ability, originality as
a composer and a talent for publicity. His
mother discovered very early that Percy was
destined to be famous, and she devoted all
her cleverness —and she was a very clever
woman —to making the dream come true.
The boy finished his training at Leipzig
under Carl Reinecke, a delightful old chap
who had been married four times and had
more daughters than he could keep track
of. But the big event in Grainger’s
musical life was his meeting with Edvard
Grieg, greatest of all Norwegian com-
posers. What Liszt did for Wagner,
Grainger has done for Grieg. He has taken
the Norwegian’s work on to the concert
platform and forced the public to appreciate
its beauty. The tragedy of the pianist’s life
was the death of his beloved mother, who
fell out of the window of a New York sky-
scraper a year or two ago. As a pianist
Grainger is not the emotional typo, though
his playing is full of life. It is enough on
that score to say that he plays Bach admir-
ably. He is full of new and revolutionary
ideas about music. It was he who suggested
a super-pianoforte in which quarter-tones
should be sandwiched in between the notes
of the existing scale; lie is a champion of
jazz and the saxophone and the reverse in
all respects of the musical snob. He took
out naturalisation papers in U.S. in 1917
in order to go across the sea as a bandsman.
He played the saxophone. He is 44 and
unmarried.
“Ces”: A Bulletin contributor’s idea
that Britain and Australia should co-operate
in the production of films has a fair prospect
of being realised. In England a British
Empire Film Institute has been formed
under Asquith’s chairmanship, and with the
blessings of George Five and Baldwin, to
encourage the making of films depicting the
life, literature and history of the Empire.
A related scheme is a production company
with a capital of £1,500,000. A representa-
tive of the co. has been touring Victoria in
search of a site for a studio. The specifications
comprise 1000 acres near mountainous country
and within easy reach of the sea, and Heales-
ville lias been selected as a likely spot. The
co. hopes to get financial help from the
Federal Government. That, of course, is
out of the question, but tariff assistance
should be forthcoming, especially if the Bald-
win Government will reciprocate.
“Wigs”: Litigation over “No, No,
Nanette” (B. 27/5/’26) is not confined to
this country. An American touring manager
named Dan Arthur has sued the better-
known H. H. Frazee for 25 p.c. of the profits
of “Nanette,” claiming that “His Lady
Friends’.’ was. the “libretto foundation” of
the musical piece. Dan won the first round,
but I suppose he will be kept busy until the
final court of appeal has had its say, especi-
ally as Frazee’s earnings are mentioned at
two million dahlers.
“Goldilocks”: Harry Muller, remembered
by old hands as the obliging youth who,
as clerk for the agents of the theatre at
Palmerston- North (M.L.), looked after
visiting companies, is making Australian
vaudeville history. Fullers snapped him up
as a manager for their companies, and he
grew in importance on the house-front until
lie went to America as representative of
Tivoli circuit interests. Muller has now
booked up the Santray Band, which is a
variety show in itself, the complete turn
running 30 minutes. Wherever it goes in
America it is advertised like a big film
(“billed like a circus” is out of date nowa-
days), and Muller is considered to have
done a big stroke in inducing the combina-
tion, which has 17 performers, to come to
Australia. The inducement is said to be
£BOO a week, by far the highest fee for any
vaudeville turn on an Australian circuit to
date.
“Curtain-raiser”: Australian plays have
never been plentiful, but of late years they
have been harder to find than a clean street.
Louis Esson has come to the attack with
“The Bride of Gospel Place,” which Mel-
bourne Pioneer Players are to do their best
with at the Playhouse on
June 9. It is described by
its author as four acts of
low life enacted in an all-
night restaurant, an under-
world Bacchanalia and a
hospital ward, and the char-
acters are thieves, pugs,
touts and pretty ladies.
Sounds interesting, and not
very real-Australian. But
W. B. Yeats once remarked
of the Victorian playwright
that he made good dialogue
out of idiomatic speech, and
the speech promised in this
case is dinkum Australian.
“A.G.M.” (Lond.) : Gladys
Mon crieff, who stepped on
to the London stage with
very little preliminary advt;,,
made a notable personal tri-
umph. Every worth-while
critic in London praised her
singing, her acting and her
appearance. More than one
admitted that “Riki-Tiki,”
the new musical play selected
for her debut, would have
died swiftly but for the sav-
ing grace of her work. When
one recalls the reticence of
the connoisseurs on the early
appearances in London of
such ultimate favorites as
Myra Kemble, Nellie Stew-
’ art, Hilda Spong, Ethel Hay-
don, Mabel Lane, Florence
You n g, Alice Crawford,
Pattie Browne, Fannie Lid-
diard and other gifted
artistes, Miss Moncricff
should be highly gratified by
the “best press” ever accord-
ed to any Australian debut
except that of Amy Castles.
And the audience anticipated
the critics. Now that Gladys
has got over a very natural
nervousness, she is singing better, and if the
libretto can be invigorated with a little
humor, “Riki-Tiki” should have a run at the
Gaiety.
“Wood’s Green” (Lond.) : Seymour Hicks,
in deploring the dearth of really good actors
on the English stage, names Cyril Iveightley
as among the first half-dozen. Even now
this artist bears an extraordinary likeness to
his mother, Mrs. Keightley, the very tall and
slender lady who up to her death about 10
or 12 years ago used to be pointed out in
Sydney and Melbourne as the original of the
heroine in “Robbery Under Arms,” whose
sensational ride through the bush was a
thrilling episode from real life in the bush-
ranging days.
“A.G.M.” (Lond.) : Australians will have
a kindly memory for Jean Forbes-Robertson,
the timid novic'e who first tried her stage
wings in Adelaide and who within the last
year has done some excellent work in the
London theatres. “Don .Tuan,” an earlier
play than “Hassau,” by .Tames Elroy
Flecker, was staged at the Court Theatre
on the last Sunday in April, just to show
once more that England lost by his untimely
death a potential dramatist and poet of the
first rank. In this production Miss Forbes-
Robertson was the ugly sister, and, inci-
dentally, acted her first love scene. Of many
striking tributes, one of the most notable
was from the Daily Telegraph, which said:
“Alone of all our young actresses she has
the great gift—of being-able, almost without
moving a muscle, to show you her thoughts.
If she goes on as she has begun, the highest
honors of her profession will soon be within
her grasp.” Her father and mother watched
Jean from a box on the first night.
“Schnorrer”: Jacob P. Adler, known as
“the father of the Yiddish stage,” is dead,
in New York. Born in Odessa 71 years ago,
Adler introduced Yiddish performances to
London when they were banned in Russia
in 1883. Five years later he went to
America, where in New York alone there, is
a population capable of keeping Yiddish
theatres going all the year round; but he
returned to play in London from time to
time. Jacob Gordon, the best known of
Yiddish dramatists, wrote many of his plays
specially for Adler. One of the latter’s
greatest successes was made in the Jewish
“King Lear” —the title is given, in irony, to
an old man who allows his daughters to domi-
nate him—which was recently produced at
the Maccabean Hall, Sydney, by the Yiddish
Dramatic Society.
“Chorus Gent”: Frances 'Alda, leading
soprano at the New York Metropolitan
Opera House for the last decade, is a grand-
daughter of, and received her early training
from, that Madame Fanny Simonsen who
kept opera alive in Australasia for more
than a quarter of a century. I once inter-
viewed Madame and her husband in a humble
enough lodging in Devonshire-street, Sydney;
the stars of those days were not half as pre-
tentious as far dimmer lights of to-day. She
was an old lady then, old enough to have a
daughter who, after taking her mother’s
place during an operatic tour, made a last
THE DIFFICULTIES OF HER JOB.
“Oh, it’s ever so much more difficult to he a had woman
on the stage than in real life, I tell you.”
“Nonsense, darling—on the stage it’s only acting.”
“Yes, hut the stage had-woman has to act so that no
one in the play will recognise her as had while
everyone in the audience does.”
appearance in “Maritana” at Melbourne
Bijou in 1884, and then went to England to
study for 18 months under Marches! She
left the stage when she bec..me Mrs. George
Sclireiber, and settled down in Melbourne.
Fanny, another daughter, who took the name
of Frances Saville, made a reputation and a
fortune in Europe, and now lives in the
Riviera. Some of Madame’s talent also
descended to Frances Alda’s mother, but
two sons had no particular bent for music
and went in for plain commerce in Mel-
bourne.
“Goldilocks”: There arc no stage stories in
Seymour Hicks’s book on Australia, but he
could have told one at least. In his Sydney
co. there was an ambitious neophyte who
was fitted with a small part for which he
was supplied with pants of a pattern that
made them pure comedy. The laughter
evoked by the first sight of the grotesque
bags was so great that it overshadowed the
reward for one of Seymour’s own sallies.
That Simply Isn’t Done, so Hicks straight-
way told the recruit that the comic pants
would in future be “cut.” At the end of
the performance he heard that the youth
had thrown in his part. Sending for him,
Seymour asked kindly—though something of
an egotist he can be kind enough—what the
trouble was. The novice’s face was flaming,
and he seemed on the point of weeping as he
burst out: “You said to me to-night, ‘To-
morrow you will get out of those trousers.’
Well, 'Mr. Hicks, I’m not going to do that
for anybody!”
“Hamfat”: James Sylvestre Ryan,, the
mystery-man among Australian actors who
have sought fortune in America, just missed
a reappearance in Australia, although it
would not have been personal. A J. C. Wil-
liamson man who spent seven months in
America on the Firm’s business took a special
run to see a play of Jimmy’s on “Silver
King” lines. It had made something of a
hit, and the Williamson chap thought it
might be of use in Australia, but he decided
it wouldn’t. As “Narranghi Boori” Ryan
wrote some capital light verse for The Bul-
letin and republished it in “Splinters on
the Wall.” None of his old Bohemian pals
would be surprised to hear that lie had writ-
ten a dramatic best-seller.
“iCfesar’s Ghost”: One of the last acts
of Franz Kneisel, founder of the Kneisel
Quartet and regarded as one of the finest ex-
ponents of chamber music in the world,
was to write a highly laudatory report about
the progress of his pupil, the Sydney boy-
violinist Harry Klass, who went to America
on the advice of Kreisler. The report was
received on the morning of Kneisel’s death.
“Ctesar’s Ghost”: Jack Cosgrove’s views
of the jokes that might be played upon other
members of the co. and the audience often
caused managerial wrath, but the jester was
incorrigible. In one play the heroine had
been giving the usual synopsis of previous
events to make the action of the play clear.
“But why do I tell you all this?” she asked,
according to author’s direction. “Well, we’ve
fjoi to let the people in front know what it s
all about,” said Cosgrove calmly. The lady,
glaring wildly at him, followed with her
next line: “Oh, I had to tell yon. I had to!
“Of course you had to,” said Cosgrove
serenely; “it’s in your part.” The manage-
ment forgave him in time, but the heroine
never did. She used to cut him in the street.
Art and Architecture: —
An extraordinarily interesting show has been got
together by the Institute of Architects at the Educa-
tion Gallery in Sydney. Although visions are given
of towering buildings now in the making, plans and
specifications, interesting to those in the business,
are a very minor part of the exhibition, which passes
from model houses to the things that should go into
tliefn, even to books and craftily-worked ornaments.
One can feel a twinge of envy for the surroundings
of L. V. Waterhouse, of Neutral Bay, whose house,
with its wealth of artistic detail and romantically-
designed garden, is appropriately described as his
“home-place” ; and then pass on to designs for fire-
places, staircases and artistic furnishings. Of the
buildings to be erected in Sydney the fine lines of
the School-teachers’ Federation Club premises, appa-
rently to go up in Young-street, attract attention
with its luxurious interiors ; and work by architec-
tural students is also most interesting—Raymond
McGrath, whose design for “A Town Club in
Elizabeth-street” and a building with metal sheath-
ing, and Albert Barnard, who as a fifth-year student
at the Technical College has made a splendid design
for the National War Museum, in particular. A
model of Shakspeare’s Globe Theatre, made by Harold
Carter, the son of artist Norman Carter, with the
help of his father, makes another interesting ex-
hibit. The book section, containing art productions
of the Nonesuch, Ricardi, Beaumont and Julian
Presses, shows the printer’s art at its best. A page
of one of these books is a picture in itself, compelling
admiration. There is, for instance, «one booklet issued
in 1923 by the Nonesuch Press at 55., which now
has a value of three guineas a copy; also “The First
Chapter of Genesis,” with cubist illustrations by
Paul Mack —title-pages, headings and tail-pieces all
admirable. In this section alone one can browse for
an hour.
Impressionist work by Paul Henry dominates the
show of “Eight Contemporary British Artists” now
at the Macquarie Galleries, Bligh-street. Imagina-
tion and fine treatment of broad color effects is shown
in “A Village in Connemara” ; the masses of cloud
in the background are treated with vigor, and the
play of light on the village itself, with, the sur-
rounding heavy shadows, is very effective. Francis
Dodd, showing well-arranged effects in “Winter
Morning, Russell-square,” and Charles Cundell, who
works in a mass of detail without inconveniently
crowding “Les Andelys,” do well also in oils, but
the water-colors of Francis Dodd, Ethelbert White,
Muirhead Bone and Randolph Schwabe (whose etch-
ings are good, a “Portrait of Francis Dodd” especi-
ally so) are crude and harsh, although in “Halt-
ing” Schwabe achieves something of the effect he
is evidently seeking. Francis Dodd’s etchings are
attractive, but Job Nixon’s taste for the bizarre
leads him to draw what look more like nightmares
than any real scenes in this mundane sphere. And,
except in “Cave Dwellers,” he draws them badly, too.
The elfin fancy of Ethel L. Spowers is shown in
20 water-colors, a pen-drawing, and color and plain
woodcuts at the Grosvenor Gallery, George-street.
The work is, as a rule, gracefully decorative and
pleasing, although there are occasions when the
artist fails —the faun in “Nymph and Faun” has a
dreadful face. The child studies are the best. “Little
Red Riding-Hood” opens the door of her grand-
mother’s cottage with just the right hesitant expec-
tancy ; the boy sitting on the verandah looks through
“The Bamboo Blind” at his playmates outside, and
there is youthful joy and a fresh breeze blowing in
“The Lost Balloons.” A green night-light view of
“Collins-street” and “The Staircase Window” are
others well worth a visit.

Zame and address must appear on the MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will he returned
unless stamps accompany.
M.H.H.: The simple explanation is that
-i manufacturer can protect such an upended name
as “Allaru” but not “Uralla” D.M.E.: It still
bumps too badly.... Aparita: You’ve left it very
late in the day and haven’t made much of a job
of it even then....Culex: Too late Mag: Over-
flow ery for the subject.... Madeline H.: Doesn’t quite
earn its space... .E.P. Trundle: As froth it is good
enough, but Tile Bulletin wants the beer R.H.H.:
Not a very interesting picture of our sister....
J.H.L.: It has a downright movement ' like that of
an axe chopping potatoes:—
A man with a bee in his bonnet
" ho’s the subject of this little sonnet
Has a mania against strong drink
From which topic he does not shrink.
He argues it out in his church
IV here all boozers he tries to besmirch
Against the advice of his deacons
And the scandal of all the most meek ones
What will hap to this poor witless fool
Who’s of wowser the veriest tool?
He’s a victim of merest obsession
Which spells for the most retrogression.
....Eleanor W.: You spoil it by introducing the
commonplaces of the prayer meeting H.P.S.: The
intention is good; the verse isn’t E.A.S.: Far too
crude... .Doris H.; Wooden and trite H.D.M. (or
something else) : Nearly always alphabetical rhymes
are the last resort of the person who has nothing
to say and no skill in saying it W.M.W.: Mourn-
ful and with no lift in it.... Long Jack: No use
in that form.... Athol R.: The theme is weak and
some of the lines run away with the metre
Gerald W.: Your fears are justified. It is a long
way off—.N.K.S.: Nicely done, but too slight....
Leone R.: It can hardly be called verse.... N.W.
(Maryborough) : All slight in theme and not strongly
done....M.S. (Tootool) : Not up by some distance
....Augustus W.: Glad to hear from you again.
“Regret” stands quite alone in its class:—
If I only could recall the few years gone by
When I loved a Maid and she loved me,
the Mistake we made would never be
In our Courting, Loving displayed.
O could I only recall the times gone by,
the wrong I done would be put aside;
with Love in a happy home, we could abide;
But I left her in a Misunderstanding dismayed.
O could I hold her only once in my Arms
and tell her of Love in me to believe,
hoping that I did not her deceive—
No, not for all the World and its charms!
Dearest, if this Verse should come to your View,
think of my vain Regret. I write to you.
May your Eyes shine bright your heart beat true—
my thoughts of are many, and words are few.
. ...M.S.A.; Doesn’t win u 5.... Johnny W.: • Yarn
about how you took down the confiding drunk doesn’t
strike us as very amusing. .. .Sayso: “The Appendix”
is cut 0ut.... J.S.: If the tumbling cascades of
“The Little Mountain Spring” had really said any-
thing, it would have had a good chance... .Imp:
Your paean about “Sin’s Delight” recalls a curate
going gay on a bun D.T.H.: One set is blank
verse, but not well enough done; the other is
blanky, but not verse.... Cain: Do you really think
that a finish on “Hell” spelt with a dash is a
big enough joke to carry 36 lines? Signal A.:
A nude thought like that needs to be clothed in
artful verse... .D.H.R.: “Mailman’s Horse” suffers
a little from staggers, but might find a collar else-
where. .. .H.R.M,: “The Tree” is too mechanical
a vegetable for us... .H.D.8.: It needs something
to explain what the unmusical native name repre-
sents. Is it river, rock or just plain boojum ?....
Ller: Too slight... ,B.E. (Willoughby): Very un-
convincing. .. .K.K.: “Dad” agrees too easily in the
first instance; the rest is not bad... .D.U.D.: You
do not make clear enough what it is all about
M.H.S.: “Over the Back Fence” is unpleasant with-
out being amusing... .Fred M.: The self-confidence
trick does not lay hold quickly enough... .R.W.S.:
Dreary... .R.D.C.: The tin tale is thin and not very
interesting Aidrick: It hasn’t the skill...'.
L.N.H.: The lines are short-weight... .8.A.N.:
Watch your feet; before the end your muse became
a centipede.. . .R.McD.: “Wintev Wind” is blowing
back to you. .. .Gidgi: “Dirty Billy” would be worth
a par if you definitely located his old address
W.M.L.: While we are naturally flattered at being
regarded as the right channel for your “Thanks-
giving” to go to Headquarters, it has to be sent
back. Yet both only just fail. .. .Dix: Crude writing
is the fly in “The Ointment”... .H.A.L.: “The
Crossroads” is very ordinary blank verse at best
and the matter is old commonplace. One line is
about 2-2 in. out of scansion... .R.W.K.: Neither
yarn is convincing.... Askarri: The disease is over-
stated and the remedy suggested looks like being
a disease itself A.W. (Deep Creek) : All miss....
Henry F.: The sanatorium verse is ill-done....
Stewart T.: The parable is too difficult.... Bertha
V.: The matter is slim enough to make every flapper
jealous... .Fan: Don’t attempt to rhyme “court”
with “wrought” this weather. Leave it till every-
thing is limper.... J.A.T.: Doesn’t get there
J.H.C.: The golden-calf incident would be better
if it kept in step and had a little more in it....
Phene: Not up by some distance J.K.8.: Ditto.
... .Roger H.: Not the sort of thing we care for... .
Omer: You use phrases without knowing quite what
they mean. “Higher critics” have nothing to do
with literature... . E.M.: There is nothing like
exposing vice in forceful fashion:—
As hydrophobia dogs they come,
They wag the tail and hath a grin
Until they safely housed within.
The Devil stirs them up for gain.
O when they find there’s none remain
They bare their teeth for vengence reign.
They roam the world on gentle tags,
Their inerds hid with classic rags;
They make believe they’re spotless, pure,
As centrifugal keeps them sure.
The truth is bold and love is great,
Man dinkum took them for a mate.
Harry M.: “Shearer” has philosophised in the
same way too many times H.J.8.: Has a few
flaws, but we’re sorry there isn’t room for it.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
A.H.T.: Wash too muddy for reproduction....
K.G.: Still an* amateurish indecision about the
linework.... D.H.: Don’t worry about the size; how
to improve your drawing should be your chief
concern.... Ink: The angler who informed the in-
quisitive onlooker that he was only drowning -worms
has passed our way before V.P.: The pickpocket
needs operating upon. Gaze at his right shoulder
and twisted back .T.S.A.: The effort to faithfully
reproduce the midwife’s corpulency was at least
heroic... .K.W.C.: How jvell you balance things!
While the goamia up the tree is as large as a
crocodile the hungry abo. has been artistically
reduced to the size of an African pygmy... .T.8.M.;
Dare not expose those efforts to the cruel eyes of a
pitiless world... .R.M.: What is that protruding
from the water—an oar, a crutch or a periwinkle.

markable for its power to expel this
germ danger, eradicate disease, and

soon takes “the fire” out of a wound,
reduces swelling, and allays irritation
and inflammation.
4. Because Zam-Buk has opened up a
new era in skin-healing with its herbal
origin and its notable freedom from
lardy fats and coarse or insoluble
mineral drugs. Zam-Buk is termed, a
“complete solution” and is thus readily
absorbed by the pores.
5. Because Zam-Buk is a complete “sur-
gery in a two-inch box.” Use it for
superficial injuries and deep-seated
skin disease, and rub-it-in where
directed for sprains, colds, chills,
rheumatism, and any other embroca-
tional purpose.
6. Because Zam-Buk attains the 100 per
cent, standard of healing efficiency.
First-aid experts have known and
trusted Zam-Buk for a quarter of a
century.
7. And, finally, because the regular use
of Zam-Buk by every member of your
family mpans better skin health all

“Six and Eight”: I know a N.S.W. soli-
citor who never locks his safes; he merely
closes the doors, shoots the bolts and hangs
on the door-handles notifications that bur-
glars needn’t trouble to use gelignite. There
isn’t much inside but title-deeds, and Parch-
ment reasons that no thieves would be
bothered with them. Generally speaking, the
cash held by solicitors is negligible, and it
is cheaper to risk the little rather than pay

“Sturt”: Prof. Wood-Jones, back at Adel-

We had much to learn, were making no effort to
learn, and did not greatly care to be taught. It was
humiliating to be told that, were our pelts from
Flinders Chase to be properly prepared and graded,
they would certainly be regarded with suspicion by
the trade, since Australian pelts were not. wont to
be so marketed. To be ill-prepared, ungraded and
badly marketed is the hall-mark of this particular
item of our produce.
A nice reputation for our casual ways to
bring us!

probably have to go to old pictures to

herding the leisurely hordes of jumbucks

has lately been put on the road. Loads of

on foot takes them two and a half days.

vice is too big for its job? In Victoria a
detective-sergeant who has spent years in
criminal work has just been transferred on
promotion to the charge of a station as a
sub-inspector, his long experience as a detec-
tive being thereby absolutely wasted. The
same stupidity obtains in other departments.
The clerks in. the service, about 1100, are
grouped in one seniority-list, and divided
into six classes. I know of one case where
an officer with long service in the Penal
Department was promoted and transferred
to a branch of the Taxation Department.
* * * *
“Clerk” : For the first time a really suc-
cessful wireless test has been made on a
moving train in Victoria. The luxurious
“Norman” car was, fitted with a seven-valve
set, and engineer Calcutt got without diffi-
culty from all inter-State broadcasting sta-
tions while the train was doing upwards of
50-m.p.li. The volume .was loud enough to
drown extraneous noises (which have marred
all previous attempts to cage the waves in a
Vic. railway carriage on the move), and
interference from the car-lighting dynamo
was eliminated by a special current filter
and trap slung to the under girders. It
shouldn’t be long before flic parlor-car on the
Sydney express is fitted •with aerials.
* * * *
“J.8.H.” : The objection taken to the un-
trammelled importation of trashy American
literature might well be extended to the in-
vasion, of American “songs.” I recently re-
ceive/! a circular from a “song agency (Inc.)”
in the U.S.A. inviting me to send “lyrics”
to be set to music by the institution’s tame
Tschaikowskys. It was pointed out that such
a collaboration might lead tg vast profits for
all concerned—provided the trifling prelimi-
nary of five dollars for a registration fee
paved the way. Several specimen “lyrics”
which had turned out great successes were
enclosed for my encouragement; and if I
wrote my honest opinion of most of them I
should have to do it on a sheet of asbestos.
* * * *
“Hamer”: Cyril Blackett, whose father
was the architect who-’dcsigned St. Andrew’s
Cathedral, Sydney, has quoted a couple of
early instances of church support for local
industry which there seems a tendency to.
forget nowadays. The harmonious bells of
St. John’s, Glebe, were made in Sydney by
William Taylor; but local industry wasn’t
given even a thought when the University
carillon was under consideration. At St.
Saviour’s Cathedral, Goulburn, are three fine
large windows, two made in Australia and
the third imported. Bishop Thomas used to
point them out and ask for a guess about
which was the imported one. When the
guesser was wrong, as mostly happened, the
good bisli would sound the loud timbrel for
the /""firalia he loved so well.
# » « *
“Really” : Onion-growers have this season
been among the most fortunate of Vic.’s
farmers; the prices reached their highest
for years. Remunerative as these crops
have been, the profits have been small com-
pared with those obtained from growing
onion-seed. The seed from the Beeac dis-
trict has achieved a wide reputation, and
large parcels have been forwarded to all
the States and beyond them. One farmer
from 10 acres obtained over two tons, which
he sob I ay* to 10s. per pound.
*## - *
“Miro” : After long and fierce altercation
the Auckland City Council has decided to
banish the kerb-side pump, and the bowser
with a line of thirsty cars awaiting their
turn will soon no longer he a disturbing
sight to its rivals. Increase in city traffic
and a disinclination to encourage kerbstone
business were the causes assigned for the
prohibition; after six months all motorists
will have to do their shopping inside, after
the manner of ordinary folk.
* * * #
“Hobnobster”: Booksellers make big
profits on the sale of impoi’ted fiction and
plays, and it may be alleged in extenuation
that this acts as a mild stimulant to local
talent. But when anything from sixpence
to five bob is added to the price of cheap
reprints of the classics and text-books that
no attempt is made to print here, it is over
the fence. The booksellers are allowed a
substantial margin by the publishers, and
import their hooks in big quantities, which
must mean a big saving in freight. Yet 15
hooks I recently imported from England in
three lots, paying money-order poundage and
parcels-postage (Id. for two ounces), I found
so cheqp that I could sell them at the same
price as charged in the shops and show a
handsome profit.

“Goodnight”: Are there any authentic
cases on record of triplets reaching maturity
and having a marked resemblance one to
another?
“J.’s Ass.”: Queer names? Well, here in
Maoriland we have a Dr. Doctor. That
wouldn’t be so strange if he hadn’t married
a Nurse Nurse. The double must be a
record.
“Coot”: In the list of items included in
the first supply of stationery sent by the
N. S. Wales Government to Port Phillip
appears the very significant “20 fathoms of
red tape.”
The grimmest, joke of Queensland politics
is that the electoral affairs of the State,
with its gerrymandered electorates regularly
returning a Labor majority on a minority
vote, are controlled by the Department of
Jqstice.
Samuel Lunn, M.8.E., universally known
as “Sammy” while he lived, has had a monu-
ment to his honor placed in the Soldiers’
Cemetery at Adelaide. It carries a bronze
medallion of his head, and was unveiled
lately in the presence of a big gathering of
Diggers and nurses by W. F. J. McCann,
local president of the R. S. and S. L. Lunn
was the finest beggar in a good cause that
Adelaide ever knew.
E. H. Peake, son of a former S.A. Pre-
mier, has returned to Adelaide as Sergeant-
at-Arms in the State Parliament, after a
long term in the Agent-General’s office in
London. His place in the Fog will be taken
by A. H. Greenham, who holds a commerce
diploma of Adelaide Uni., and has been in
Government service ever since he was 15
(he is 31 now), except for four years of
war-time stretcher-bearing.
“Pick”: The ancient Sydney-side abo.
Rickety Dick, to whose memory “Five
Corners” suggests a Historical Society tablet
(B. 20/5/’26), hasn’t gone into the shadows
entirely uncommemorated. In my collection
of curios is a copper medallion, the size of
a halfpenny, struck at the Sydney Exhibition
in 1873. On the face side is a native’s head,
with the name “Rickety Dick” and the date.
On the reverse side a pair of ’possum have
displaced the kangaroo and emu as sup-
porters of the Australian coat-of-arms.
Arthur Fullarton, the new secretary of
the Queensland Chamber of Manufactures,
was until recently on the other side of the
fence. For over five years he was secretary
of the Federated Clothing arid Allied Trades
Union. He hails from Orange (N.S.W.), and
had business experience as manager for his
father in Sydney and partner with his
brother at Gunnedah before taking on liis
union job. Lately he has come into promi-
nence in connection with the Queensland
Preference League; and as the league is
backed by the Government, Fullarton won’t
have to play a lone hand in pushing forward
Bananaland’s manufacturing industries.
“Centurion”: Houston, a Liverpool mil-
lionaire, fled to Jersey to dodge British tax-
ation, and his death there may provide King
George with some spending silver, if he likes
to go after it. The British Government
would have collared at least 40 per cent,
in death-duties out of Houston’s £7,000,000
had his domicile been in the U.K.; under
the feudal law of Jersey, the King may enjoy
the use of the property for a year and a
day, Houston having left no heir. This
privilege is his, not as King of Great Bri-
tain, etc., but as Seigneur of Jersey, which
is a fief du roi. One Sydney paper, by the
way, gave the latter phrase as the address
where Houston died. Even if he has to let
go the property in 12 months, G.lt. could
make quite a lot of play with seven millions
in that time.
“Hopalong” : The Queensland Unemployed
Workers’ Insurance Act provides some queer
anomalies. No extra allowance is made for
a man whose daughter or sister keeps house
for him, but a nian living with a woman not
his Avife (although his Avife may be alive)
is paid at the married rate, and he is also
paid for any of her children. Again, if a
man leaves work through illness he is not
entitled to any sustenance until he has re-
covered and is fit to re-commence work, but
if he is taken sick subsequent to his lodging
an application for sustenance payments are
continued. Finally, if a man leaves work of
his own accord, no matter for what reason,-
his sustenance is deferred for six Aveeks or
longer, but so long as he is sacked he is
allowed to lodge a claim right away. These
are only several of the many inequalities
which should haAre been remedied before now.
The Chidley doctrine showed signs of
crawling out of the grave when Harry
Meatheringham made an appearance in the
North Sydney Police Court in sleeveless
shirt, shorts and black slippers. The police
objection was not to his attire, but to his
possession of copies of “The Answer,” Chid-
ley’s book, which they regard as obscene, and
hoped had vanished for good, though second-
hand booksellers still exhibit it shamelessly.
.Chidley’s mantle (or dismantle) fell on his
secretary, Shirlaw, when he died. Shirlaw,
who looked very like Chidley save for his
leader’s magnificent physique, took refuge in
a big, old house fronting Berry’s Bay which
its inhabitants called “The Abode of Peace.”
There, with some disciples, he formed a
settlement on communistic lines. Later,
however, he took to conventional clothes, even
to a hat. The latest apostle, Harry Meather-
ingham, is more outspoken, and has had a
couple of spells in gaol.
“C.M.”: Re “N. or M.’s” account of the,
late Mrs. Jane Quintal, of Norfolk Island
(B. 13/5/’2<>), Joshua Hill’s revolution took
place in 1833, four years before the lady
Avas born, so all that she could recall was
hearsay. Her father’s ordination was due
to the sponsorship of Admiral Moresby. He
undertook all expenses, both on Nobbs’s
account and for his daughter’s education in
Valparaiso, and he brought them back to
Pitcairn in 1853. There was no actual en-
gagement between Jane Nobbs and Captain
Chads (the Admiral’s flag-captain), though
the affair would doubtless have come to that
but for the interception of their correspon-
dence—probably the work of Nobbs himself,
who may well have been opposed to such
a mixed alliance. Captain Chads, who never
married, in after years became au admiral.
He and Mrs. Quintal exchanged messages
and presents about 50 years later, when all
misunderstandings were explained. Nobbs,
by the Avay, was the illegitimate son of the
Marquis of Hastings.

write and let you know .what
a wonderful ointment Rexona
is. For years I suffered from
Eczema and could not get any-
thing to give me relief from
this awful skin trouble. 1 had
doctors’ and chemists’ pre-
scriptions of ointments and
lotions, but everything seemed
to irritate more, so I decided
to try Rexona Ointment, and
after two weeks’ treatment
received great benefit. 1 shall
always recommend Rexona
Ointment to all who suffer in
the same way as I did, and
will always keep a tin of it
in the house. It is worthy of
the name—The Rapid Healer.”

The Ballad of Holy Aengus.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
_ j- Q tale is this the friese-clad lierds-
l\ J men tell
/ V About the sheepfold, leaning on
•A " their crooks;
Oak-hound, the men of prayer have kept it
well,
Written thrice blessed in their holy hooks.
In Innisfail the gods were dead,
Their temples patched with moss of shame,
A thousand winters’ slaughter red
Heaped scorn on each forgotten name.
The sliipmen burned, the sliipmen slew,
Black voices cried along the night,
Smutted with blight the lean crops greiv,
The men of battle fell in flight.
A thousand years the harvest failed,
Men ploughed the sod with bitter siveat,
Wild women for thjeir first-born Availed
And all the world with tears was wet.
Queen Hertha bore the king a son,
A child unlike his father’s face;
She turned her on the bed to shun
The darkness of its puny face.
The midwives came, the midwives went,
Queen Hertha wept her sorrow dry,
Then rose upon her arm and leant
Above the babe with hungry eye.
They heard her lift a sudden Avail.
“What thing is this that ye have done?”
The midwives’ cheeks were terror pale—•
“0 queen of joys, it is thy son.”
“My son is dark, and this is fair,
My son is like a herdsman’s brat,
This child has glory on his hair,
A thing that kings may marvel at.”
The youngest, midwife looked askance,
The eldest midwife fearful spake,
“Nay, Queen, he hath his father’s glance;
’Tis from an evil dream you Avake.”
The queen gazed strangely on the twain.
“And did I dream? And is it true
That for reward of mother pain
This child is mine Avitli eyes of blue?”
The eldest midwife said, “In sooth” ;
The youngest midwife trembled sore.
“By the king's head, speak ye the truth,
is this bright thing the child I bore?”
The midwives SAvore before the bed
The changeling babe Avas liertha’s child.
Some happy tears the mother shed,
Then clasped it to her heart and smiled.
The king came knocking at the wall,
A heavy fear was on his face,
He stooped his shoulders lean and tall
To come within the quiet place.
The child lay on the queen’s round arm,
Its dimpled cheek was fair to see.
“The white birds guard thy soul from harm
Who bringest such a gift to me!”
The gods of Innisfail were dead,
About their altars Avaved the weed.
The autumn Avoods Avere dripping red,
A murrain smote the steer and steed.
Queen Hertlia’s babe to stature grew,
An idle lad of dream and song.
And still the sliipmen burned and slcav
And all the ruined world went wrong.
The king with wounds upon his back
Fell as he fled before the foe;
Tall spearmen put the vale to sack,
The queen died naked on the snow.
In byres and caves about the land
The broken men of Innisfail
Crouched beast-like, fearing the red hand
Of morning on the coming sail.
Young Aengus, reared on Hertha’s lap,
Blew through the woods a hunter’s horn,
Or heard the heavy heron flap
Across the black bogs in the morn.
A song was his of thrushes’ Avings,
Of bees that murmur on the whins,
Of happy tears the south wind flings
Along the Avorld when spring begins.
Good heart had he of all things Avild,
The bracken made his easy bed,
The torrent streams through rainbows smiled
Down-leaping from the mountain’s head.
The gods were dead in Innisfail,
About their altars waved the Aveed;
Why came their faces stern and pale
To taunt his sleep Avitli dreams of deed?
He dreamt of arms and spear and shield,
Of loud fights clanging doAvn the land,
And of a sword none else could wield
Blood-reddened in his master hand.
Above his waking hung a mist,
A soft, grey mist on stone and tree,
And on the lonely air he Avist
A sound, of Avizard minstrelsy.
Doavii stept from out the shining cloud
A woman in that lonely place ;
Her step along the moss Avas proud
And all the spring Avas in her face.
“And who art thou?” young Aengus said,
“And wherefore art thou made so fair?
For surely now the gods are dead.
Though glory shinetli on thy hair.”
Up spake that maiden of the dawn :
“What dost thou here Avitli idle how?
The ships along the shore are drawn,
Thy last men-kin are slain below.
“Gird sword and shield and hie thee down
To bear with men thy master part;
The glory of a new renown
Shall flame within the people’s heart.”
Her voice was like the summer south ;
She armed young Aengus for the fray,
She set a kiss upon his month
And pointed him the seaward Avay.
A hundred men of Innisfail,
Lean men, with fear and famine bold,
Upon the shore-sands wet and pale
Warred as their fathers warred of old.
A thousand bearded sliipmen strong
With laughter smote their spears aside;
The thin shaft twanging from the thong
Rushed fledged with death along the tide.
Between the black rocks and the ships
Young Aengus to his people came,
A kingship on his close-set lips,
A glory on his head like flame.
They saw, they wondered: at his shout
Their spent blood rose in sullen heat.
Like men of stone their ragged rout
Stood firm the stroke of doom to meet.
Tall Aengus strode across the sand,
His sword made lightnings in the wind.
The ridge of battle ’neath Ins hand
Broke red and left a death behind.
The wild, lean men of Innisfail,
Like wolves upon a yielding prey,
Drave hard the spear on shield and mail,
Holding their blood-trail through the fray.
Fear made the shipmen’s courage cold,
Along the trampled sands they fled;
The morning touched Avitli faery gold
The broken armor of the dead.
King Aengus strode above the slain,
No more the stricken land made wail—
The white gods were alive again
To work the good of Innisfail!
The thrushes sing, the white sheep graze,
A holy light the corn has kist;
The herdsman lifts a hand and prays
To Aengus in the mountain mist;
N.S.W..

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HE tilted cart, drawn by the hairy -
I footed, two-paced horse, waited be-
fore Deneen’s store in Quartpot
Creek for the goods that made it a travel-
ling emporium to the farms and orchards
anywhere from the Upper Settlement to
Granite Mountain; yea, even unto Billycan
Creek. Mickey, the tall, thin youth of
tAventy avlio would never groAv up if his
squeaking little voice were the only promise
of his maturity, stood in the cart, packing
the ordered goods at the back and leaving
general stock for sale in the forAvard com-
partment ; and Denny Deneen, ready for the
day’s adventures with the tilted cart, stood
at the tailboard as the long grocer brought
the orders and Mickey checked them.
“Two packiges for Soper; three packiges
for Lawson; one packige for Ilyde; two
packiges for Talty; one box. one packige tor
Cleghorn—l say, you’ve left out Clcghorn s
medsin. Where’s ' the' order ? Here _ y'are—
Dozen salts, two bottles Liver Invig rator,
two boxes pills an’ three bottles Nerf I onic.
Where’s the medsin. Mr. Scott?'
“Mr. Deneen told me not to put them in,”
replied the long grocer.
“So I did, then,” said Denny. “He’s not
havin’ them.”
“By cripes, Mr. Deneen. He’ll go off pop !
He got outer me like billy-oh lars time I
forgot 'em.” .
“I have something else for him, said
Denny. “Bring you out that little packige on
me desk, Mistlier Scott. Y’ see, Mickey,
ould Clegliorn's a loafer, an’ now lie be a
patent-medsin dhrunkard. The Liver Invig -
rator is nearly all gin, an’ the Nerve lonic
do have a pound of slitricknin in it, an the
ould loafer get his dhrink that Avay. Lis
alkyhol they will have, then. The little
child and the taytotaller get their alkyhol
’atin’ sugar an' lollies, an’ ’twould be hard
for a man to get forrarder on lollies—would
have a man ate a quarthcr of a ton of lollies
before he Avould get one hiccup, mind you.
’Tis the way ould women get the kick m
their dhrink that would be total abslitainers
all their lives, by din-inkin' patent medsms
wit’ 20 per shent o’ gin in it, then.
An’ when a poor ould woman wit
a tired back have a dhrop o’ Mother
Squoogle’s Elixir of Loife —an a good
second-nlate’s nip is all it is—’tis she would
take her wan leg out of the grave an wave
it round in great enj’yment. ’Tis alkyhol
is in all t’ings, Mickey—’tis in the air an.
sea-Avater, an' in threes an’ slitones; air
the taytotaller that would not get himself
cremated AA’it' alkyliolic wood would have
himself buried in alkyliolic clay. Tis in all
Nature. Mickey, an’ ’tis in my hotel, too, an
that’s more important, then.”
“Well, if it’s all so nacli’ral, why don t
you let him have it, Mr. Deneen?”
' “Ali, ah, ah! Mickey, me poor lad,
’tis the difference betune raw slipirit in
patent medsins an’ good slipirit in hotels
an’ betune takin’ a dhrink in company for
love of your fellow-min an’ lyin’ down lone
under the verandy an’ dhrinkin’ wit’ the
flies, an’ your childer out workin’ in the
field to keep you. Dhrink is wan of the
good t’ings of life for the enj'ymint of min
afther their Avork he done; an’ old loafer
Cleghorn have no work; so no patent med-
sins shall he have ayther.”
“All right, but lie’ll go crook on me.”
“An’ he won’t, then. I’m goin’ Avit’ you,
an’ takin’ out the pills, an’ a new nice pink
medsin I have ; an’ me advice, Mickey—me
good advice.”

Over the well-known road went the hairy-
footed horse in his other pace, which was
not walking in his sleep. To the accom-
paniment of the noisy Avelcome of the small-
est Clegliorns, who knew “cart-day” as avcll
as the hairy-footed horse did, Mickey drew
up at Clegliorn's gate, and the horse stopped
dead, and immediately stood at ease on the
near hind-foot. As the children ran to
the cart to act as glad animals of burden
to the home, Cleghorn came after them,
slowly, as if he hated movement —as if he

NEW EDISON REALISM
Challenges the world!
Where but in the New Edison can you find
reproduction as real as the living artist ?
The New Edison is in truth the living artist—so clear, so sweet, so true is its
Re-Creation of the artist’s performance. Edison music is the music of life,
exquisitely rich in qualities too subtle to be given a name.
Claims are easily made, but Edison alone presents the dramatic test of Direct
Comparison between Edison artists and their Edison records—heard by
millions of music lovers and critics everywhere. No phonograph but the
New Edison has dared present such a test to a discriminating audience.
To show our belief in the New Edison, we offer you the opportunity of hearing
it in your own home in direct comparison with any machine, new or old.

had been at Broken Hill and wore half a
ton of lead in each boot. He stopped at the
tailboard of the cart, looked into the shaded
interior and asked for his Nerf Tonic.
“Mickey didn’t bring you the ould stuff,
Cleghorn. ’Tis no use to you,” interposed
Denny.
“No useter me? Why, Mother Sqqoogle’s
’Lixir of Life suits me splendid.”
“Now, Cleghorn, you don’t know. There’s
been the Gov’mint Analyst lookin’ into
patent medsins, and he find that if they’re
dhrunk long enough by a man, a man will
die in great agony and distliress of moind,
an’ blue slipots will come out on him all
over.”
“Go on! No fear! Will it?” said Cleg-
horn, much impressed.
. “ ’Twill, then. ; All of thim patent mod-
sins will roon a man soon or late.”
“I can’t go without me Nerf Tonic.”
“ ’Tis tlirue fo ! r you—an’ I brought you
a good wan; a betther'wan than anny of
thim. ’Tis so shtrong you would take a
tablespoon full uv it t’ree-four times a day.
But ’twon’t work on you unless you have
exerchise.”
“Work? Me nerfs wouldn’t stand it!”
“Not work! Just exerchise; and’ then
you will live to be a terr’ble ould man.”
“Me wife took a lot of exercise, an’ she
died.”
“ ’Twas too much uv it, an’ the wrong
sort she had. ’Twasn’t exerchise she had,
’twas shlav’ry. > Toilin’ aud moilin’ an’
sewin’ an’ washin’ an’ stitchin' an’ eliilder.”
“I ain’t never had any luck,” said Cleg-
horn, his long upper lip sagging as his self-
pity increased. “Never no luck, not since
the Irish blight put me out o’ Tasmania.
Not a dam’ bit o’ luck since Jimmy was
born !”
“ ’Twas look enough that he was born at
all,” replied Denny sternly, and then changed
his tone that he might, retain the confidence
of his victim. “Now, you can cure your-
self of your tlirouble in Free mont's. Give
me that packige, Mickey. Open if, an’ give
me the bottles wit’ the pink Nerve Tonic
in it.”
"It is a nerf tonic, then?" said Cleghorn.
“Too thrue it is. ’Twould tonic all the
nerves betune here an Boggabri. There it
is! See that pink shtuff? That’s the ould
original ’Lixir of Life. This is what you do.
You take a tablespoonful; then take your
exerchise.”
“Walkin’ about?”
“No—that’s no good. You see, me poor
man, this tonic is very shtrong. If you don’
get into a shweat afther it, die you would —
dead as the calf Bill Puttifoot killed a-
T'ursday.”
“Would I—true?”
“Thrue as thrue! But gettin’ into a
shweat do be dhrivin’ off the poison that,
the tonic will wake up in you. Now, to do
that an’ get into a shtrong pershpiration
would do you good; you have to exerchise
hard for t’ree-four hours, an’ do you know
what’s the best exerchise you would have?
’Twould be wit’ a shpade or a hoe or some
such t’ing amusin’ yourself down here in
the catch-crops.”
"Has there been many killed be the Nerf
Tonic I ’ad before?”
“Hundreds of them. You would take your
pink tonic, then you would have your excr-
ehise in the catch-crips; back you would
come in two-t’ree hours an’ take your medsin
ag’in an’ your dinner, an’ back to work—
exerchise, I mean—an’ then your medsin
again, an’ your shupper; an’ then off to
your good bed.”
"Gimme the bottle,” said Cleghorn, con-
vinced but tearful as he accepted the tragic
duty of conquering inertia—“l’ll try it.”
“Take a dose here now, an’ begin the
threatmint, an’ I’ll tell Jimmy.”
Cleghorn took the bottle to the house to
open it as if he were going to execution, but
determined against making a scene on the
scaffold; and Denny, following him to the
orchard, found Jimmy Cleghorn bent to his
work of hilling-up the potatoes.
“Jimmy,” said Denny Deneen, “your
father has a new medsin. If he don't, per-
shpire afther takin' a dose ’twill not do him
anny good. Bee you that he pershpires.
Jimmy. Give him a hoe an’ let him hill-up
the shpuds.”
And then Denny winked, and Jimmy,
slowly understanding, winked back again.
Cleghorn came slowly. from the house
wiping his mouth, and as he arrived in the
potato rows they saw a pink sediment on his
lips. He took the hoe that Jimmy tendered
him, bent his back and groaned as he began
to hill-up. The cure had begun—Deneen’s
Nerve Tonic had entered on its work.
* " .* * #
In the fulness of time and aided by the
superstition of the pink tonic, Cleghorn came
to dig the potatoes he had hilled. His face
was a wholesome red; he had hardened, yet
gained weight. The earning of his bread by
the sweat of his brow and of all the rest of
his body made him eat that bread with a
keen appetite he had not known before.
Even the sagging upper lip seemed to be
firmer; although it. had been more than
usually tremulous in the first month of
his servitude. He still had no initiative; in-
deed, he would never find that; but Jimmy
was there as director of works, and Cleg-
horn, the father, did as he was bid, although
he dropped any task in hand on the moment
that four hours had elapsed since his last
dose of the pink tonic hnd the time was ripe
for another. He ate like a hungry man,
not as an insatiable and unappreciative
glutton; and at night he ate his supper
silently and betook his weary bones to bed
and slept like a tired child. Jimmy was so
eased by the new help that he worked gladly,
and no longer doggedly as a willing horse
over-spurred and over-burdened, accepting im-
possible tasks despairingly, but completing
them somehow. He laughed at his work,
and he and his father were surprised at
suddenly regarding each other not as slave
and battener, but as mate and mate.
And then one day before Deneen’s travel-
ling store was due for a visit the robust
patient found himself on the last dose of the
pink tonic. The discovery brought with it
a sense of injury and loss ; but he went to
work among the cabbages content to carry
on the cure to the last possible minute. At
midday, when the dose Was due, he found
he had missed something, and lay down on
the old colonial sofa on the verandah—
again Cleghorn the sick man.
Then lie heard Mill.v calling the family to
dinner, and replied that he did not feel well
enough to cat. But the hearty smell of the
corned beef and .the cabbage was too much
for him, and he arose and washed himself
by the well-head and came to the table com-
plaining, and then, seeing his enemies on his
plate, attacked them boldly with knife and
fork,
He felt better after dinner, and new habit
drove him to work again. He lusted for his
tonic in the evening, but supped heartily;
and so to bed, seeing that nothing could be
done to ward off the impending tragedy until
Deneen’s cart delivered the tonic to-morrow.
Next day as he worked in the tomato-rows
he was called back to hope by the cry of
the small sentries, self-posted to give early
news of the travelling store.
At the first cry that told him that salva-
tion was nigh, Cleghorn threw down the hoe
and ran to the gate. Denny Deneen, sitting-
on the front of the cart, saw him and
laughed aloud.
“Luk at him, Mickey. Luk at him. Ould
man Cleghorn be running like a greyhound
extinded for the hare. ’Twould kill the heart
of Uncle the Bellman if he see Cleghorn
runnin’ like your big, tall shot-tower of
a horse, Mickey.”
Cleghorn came to the cart, and Denny,
who had not seen him for a month, felt
himself a great doctor because of the
patient’s improvement.
“You luk like a wOrrld beater, Cleghorn,
me man,” said Denny. “Arrrms on you like
a blacksmit’, an’ your eye bright an' clear.
The tonic is makin’ a great man of you. me
man.” ■
"I ain't got none," replied Cleghorn, ignor-
ing the flattery—-"I ran out yestiddy after
brekfus’. I s’pose you brought some?”
"I did'not. The wan fact is that there’s
no more of it, an’ you don’t want anny.
You’re cured.”
“1 ain’t cured. I tell y’ I ain’t,” said
Cleghorn, set on remaining uncured until his
nerf tonic were produced.
“You're cured, I tell you. ’Twas work
that cured you. Workin’ in the cabbages
an’ shpuds. Luk at you now!”
“That’s tonic done that.”
“Tonic? There was no tonic but; work
and pershpiration. The shweet pink shtuff
I gave you was but colored wather an’
shweetenin’! I med it meself in me office
in the shtore.”
'“Colored water, was it?” said Cleghorn
savagely. “You pulled me leg! You took
me down !”
“I pulled your leg to make you shtrong,
and I took you down to build you up.
What's your quar'l wit’ that?”
“Bycripes! I’ll never forgive you. Years
ago I was rooned in Tassv be Irish blight,
an’ now you you’re Irish blight; that's
what you are. I’ll never forgive a man that
took a poor bloke down.”
He left the cart almost as quickly as he
h'ad come to it. They saw him hurrying
through the orchard to his place in the
tomato-rows, and then Denny laughed, as one
well pleased at the. spectacle of ('leghorn,
made doubly energetic by rage, slashing at
the weeds in frenzy.
“Dinner’s ready, Dad.’’
Cleghorn straightened himself and wiped
the Adamic sweat from his forehead. He
went slowly to the soap and towel at the
well-trough, and quickly to his meat.
“I’ll never forgive that, Dencen," he said,
cutting at the boiled pumpkin as if he
wished it, had been the heart of Denny. “He
pulled me leg with colored water. Took me
down with his tonics. Irish blight he is—
same that rootled me in Tasmania with me
spuds. Irish blight!”
"Fat your dinner, Dad.”
“Did he say anything after I left the
cart. Milly ?”
‘‘lie said he supposed you’d stop working
now you know about the tonic.”
“He did, did lie? I’ll s’pose him. I’ll
show him. He thinks he’ll pull me leg
again t' get me t’ give up work, does he?
I'll show him.”
Back in the catch-crops Cleghorn did his
man’s job with enjoyment of it mixed with
hatred of Dencen.
“Took me down with colored water.” said
Cleghorn to the catch-crops. “Irish blight!
Poor cow me! I'll show him.”
The tonic of effort reacted upon him. He
wiped his forehead again and began to hoe
another row.

The Road to Berrima.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Down the road to Berrima
While we gaily fare,
Pleasant is the country round,
Sweets of scent and sweets of sound
.Rising everywhere.
Back we send the thrushes' song,
Lilting all together,
Winds a-tune and hearts a-tune,
On a merry day in June,
With the golden weather.
Shine the miles to Berrima,
Till in truth it seems,
Bordered all with leafy trees,
That the road has memories
Happy as our dreams.
Yon a hawk drifts to and fro,
Yon a peewit hies;
Free of wing, they know no care.
Free, like them, we also fare
Under radiant skies.
All forgetting days that were—•
Days of dread and danger—
Down the miles we take our way,
Meeting never, garbed in grey,
Rogue or bold bushranger.
Light of foot we tread the miles,
Light of heart together,
Singing all Tra-la, Tra-la,
Down the road to Berrima
In the golden weather.

The Most Efficient Mower on Earth.
THE
“ATCO”
ALL-BRITISH PETROL MOTOR-MOWER.
the "wccr
petrol
mower
The “ATCO” will make a very strong appeal to those faced with the necessity
of keeping in order large areas of turf, i.c\, secretaries of cricket, golf, lawn
tennis, and bowling clubs, proprietors of estates of an acre or more, members or
park committees, hotelkeepers, etc.
It is fitted with a 2|-h.p. engine, which develops more than sufficient power
both to propel the machine and operate the cutter, thus requiring only one attendant
for guiding purposes. , ...
The running cost of an “ATCO,” thanks to the scientific precision of its
construction, is remarkably low. An operator can very easily and completely
cut 1000 square yards of turf on a fuel consumption of a quarter-pmt of petrol
and oil mixture. ' •
A twin silencer and an extra exhaust pipe (turned sideways to avoid annoy-
ance to operator) ensure,;..ejctra quiet running of engine.
Sold in two sizes—t6-inch cutters, £TI; 22-inch cutters, £lO5 complete.
Printed matter supplied with pleasure on application.
