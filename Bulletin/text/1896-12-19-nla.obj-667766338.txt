THE RED PAGE.
The Butchered Brontes.
Balzac’s remarkable story of the Succubus may
serve as one type of sex-sacrifice. Reverse the
pose: and the story of the Cretan Minotaur and
the maidens will serve as the other.
Most people know that sex has no place in the
lowest organisms through which, in their own or
kindred forms, we trace humanity’s ancestry.
Sex was life’s happy later-thought; born, as we
imagine, of the vital principle’s constant struggle
for intensity. Hence division in order to increase
the shock of union, on the principle that atoms
repelled to an intolerable point attract. The
greater the polarity the stronger the magnet.
Doubtless sex has advantaged life on its way to
the climax of intensity. Judged by any abstract
standard, it has doubtfully advantaged the average
individual form of life. So many pleasures :so
many pangs : and numerator cancels denomina-
tor into the sum as before. The life-result is
intrinsically the same— x always—only it is x
raised to humanity’s power.
But whether sex be ill or good for the average
human individual, for the exceptional individual
it is almost always ill. Se is pitilessly sacrificed
to the race, sis hopes of individual perpetuity
to the perpetuation of the common life. Mar-
riage is literally and physiologically a prior death
—the individual’s Calvary for the communi-
ty’s, the race’s salvation. The Succubus still
destroys the most brilliant of our youths : to the
Minotaur is still delivered every year a tribute of
the choicest of our maidens. Natural; and
therefore well and right from the race’s point of
view : to mend, as men have tried, is generally to
mar : yet how many bright aspirations, hopes of
progress, mental triumphs, glorious poems, are
trampled under the little pink feet of the army of
babies 1
These thoughts recur with Charlotte Bronte’s
life-story, once more partially told in Clement
Shorter’s “Charlotte Bronte and her Circle.”
The book itself adds little to our knowledge of
the family. It appears to have been undertaken
partly with the object of whitewashing Char-
lotte’s father and husband, and it succeeds in leav-
ing them mfioh as before. Another object was
seemingly to decry the well-established theory that
Charlotte was a woman like others—as in the
matter of M. Heger—and to give her the decent,
respectable character suited to the daughter of
one parson and the wife of another. The gist is
a numerous collection of unpublished letters, of
which Mrs. Gaskell skimmed the cream. The
remainder one is glad to see, though they have no
very great intrinsic interest. And Shorter adds
a biographical commentary on the journalistic
level, always with a brief for the defence of the
parsons aforesaid.
The book is issued by the religious publishing
house of Hodder and Stoughton, which is the
recognised print-vehicle of parsons from “lan
Maclaren ” downwards, and which issues a
monthly magazine, The Bookman, edited by Dr.
Nicoll, a Scotch ex-parson, to the main end of
booming the publications of the firm and its par-
son-allies and evangelical acquaintances. The
Bookman began well, with a show of independ-
ence, but latterly'the twang of devotion to piety
and the publishers—or the publishers and piety—
has sent it into the regions of literary discredit
where Gladstone roareth and the Nonconformist
conscience mourneth for its first-born.
It was written the other day that to get a genius
you want from one parent a good-quality blood
with plenty of red corpuscles, from the other a
food-quality brain and a touch of nervous disease.
'he Bronte family, perhaps the most characteris-
tic genius-family of which there is record, fills
these conditions admirably. The father was a
lusty Irishman, who wrote verses himself. The
taint of degeneracy was in his blood : he showed
insane tendencies, drank, was morbidly cruel to
his wife. The story of the sufferings of that poor
creature is one of the most affecting in literature.
She was not strong—rather delicate, indeed, and
of consumptive constitution; yet she seems to
have been normally healthy, and in the pleasant
Cornish sunshine of her birthplace might have
led a long and happy life. The Rev.
Patrick Bronte, as curate -in • charge of
Haworth, took her to a cheerless home on
the borders of a bleak Yorkshire moor,
with a graveyard on two sides of the house, and
not a soul near with whom she could have friendly
intercourse. There he murdered her by sexual
abuse; and, after producing six children in seven
years, the poor tortured wretch died horribly of
cancer supervening on physical exhaustion. In
the intervals of her child-bearing the Rev. Patrick
Bronte threw the babies’ colored shoes on the fire
in a fit of temper, or cut her silk dress into shreds,
or, when he was in a worse rage than usual, took
to firing off the pistol which night and day he
kept constantly by him. “Coldness, neglect,
tyranny, cruelty ” are Wemyss Reid’s words for
the conduct of the master; “habitual dread”
his phrase for the attitude of the slave.
And the clerical brute actually upbraided her
for having so many children ! If the poor
creature had turned and shot the Rev. Patrick
Bronte with his own pistol, she would have done
rather less than her duty to herself and her chil-
dren and humanity. But she was only a woman,
alas ! —patient and uncomplaining ; and, as she
fades lingeringly out of existence, in the agony of
her cancer, we hear her asking gently now and
again to be lifted up in bed that she might watch
the nurse cleaning the grate—“ because you clean
it as we used to clean it in my old home in Corn-
wall.” One feels keenly the want of faith in God
in circumstances like these. It would be such
a consolation to believe in a Deity who would
toast the Rev. Patrick Bronte.
Shorter’s whitewash doesn’t even begin to make
a white mark on him. It amounts to an assertion
that Mrs. Gaskell took an untrustworthy ser-
vant’s gossip; that another servant loved the Rev.
Pat; and that Charlotte’s husband, the Rev.
Arthur Nicholls, speaks highly of him. In a
word, Shorter answers precise, detailed charges
with side-issue generalities—and the charges re-
main. The Rev. Arthur also, Shorter says, has
been much maligned. He has been called cold
and unsympathetic, whereas Charlotte herself is
in superlatives about his love and kindness.
II«re again the answer is inconclusive, for loving
feminine self-deception is so common that we see
daily any wife of any husband blind to
qualities the very reverse of loveable. There
is no doubt that Charlotte, like her
mother, was a martyr to her sex. But her mar-
riage was more merciful : it did not torture her—
it killed her plump. She died nine months after-
wards, of an illness connected with childbirth.
Weak by constitution, in fact, and with such a
history of headwork, she was unable to bear the
strain of maternity. This is the penalty which
women pay for extraordinary intellectual power.
In proportion as is diverted to nourish the brain
the blood which maternity demands elsewhere,
the result is sterility, as in the case of George
Eliot, or death, as in the case of Charlotte Bronte.
When Charlotte married at 38 she was in fair
health, and had before her perhaps half her
career in literature. She threw away life and
fame because she could not resist the importuni-
ties of a man whom she states expressly that she
did not love ; and so one of the most gifted
geniuses of the century was sacrificed in endeavor-
ing to perform an act of reproduction achieved a
dozen times over by the commonest female clod
among her husband’s parishioners !
The Rev. Arthur Nicholls was a substantial
Scotchman selfish, of cold manners, rather
stubborn. His character commanded respect, but
his disposition did not invite affection. He was
not at all the man of Charlotte’s dreams, as she
candidly avows. Why, then, did she marry him ?
For a complexity of reasons. In the first place,
she was 38, and lonely, and tired, and heartsick
of the sombre, drinking, pistol-shooting father.
In the second place, the Rev. Arthur looked
like a • terribly sincere lover: he wept, grew
visibly thinner, and would take no refusal.
Charlotte couldn’t help being impressed: surely
with such a man, she thought, if with any, will
I find happiness. Perhaps the father’s bitter
opposition to the match helped to bias Charlotte
in favor of it. And finally, she looked forward
into the loveless, lonely future, and—in great
ignorance of what marriage meant, yet with many
intellectual misgivings—decided to take the leap.
There is no reason to think that the Rev.
Arthur treated his wife otherwise than kindly.
Like many others of his type, he was a very decent
fellow as long as he got his own way, and Char-
lotte gave him his own way. Her head could
never have approved of him ; but her heart began
to regard him with affection which deepened into
something like love. The sex-awakening of a
woman of 38 is apt to produce a passion which,
if it be fairly treated, gilds the marital hori-
zon for some time. As the years pass, the
Sleeping Beauties grow more and more inclined
to overlook small personal objections to the
Princes who burst through the hedge of
briars. Charlotte’s married life had not time to
become unhappy. When illness took her, her
husband made a most kind and devoted nurse—
which was quite in character. And when she
died he returned to keep company with her old
father until the old father died in his turn. Those
six years of voluntary martyrdom ought to wipe
out the memory of the deficiencies of the Rev.
Arthur Nicholls —for which, in any case, he can-
not positively be blamed.
These things, among others, are proofs that
literature is made on physiological principles ; and
that a family doctor —who can point to one page,
and say—“ Scrofula !” to another —“ Eupepsia ! ”
and to a third—“ Phthisis ! ” —should be easily
the best of literary critics.
Items.
Fiction-criticism in Lond. Times is of the
most incompetent published. Frankfort Moore—
who has not seen Australia —never tires of re-
iterating how the knowledge of Australian life
shown in his “From the Bush to the Breakers”
was praised by the Times as much more accurate
than that of “Rolf Boldrewood.”
Melb. Argus is “ Rolf Boldrewood’s ”
faithful flatterer, and when even Melb. Argus
condemns it there seems no need to wade through
R.B’s “The Sealskin Cloak’’—the last produc-
tion of one of the industrious local publishers’-
machines. Besides, the S.Q. looks dull, and
stodgy, and guide-booky, and all Melb. Argus
says it is. Words have a blessed physiognomy of
their own which tells the expert observer at once
whether there is anything behind it. “ Observer ”
—not “reader”—for the printed page yields its
secret to the eye before the mind has grasped an
image or a thought. Sometimes a stupid-looking
person is really intelligent, but a page is always
as stupid as it looks. Only, as every page has a
different face, you mustn’t judge the book by a
glimpse of one.
“Teufelswelt,” an anonymous epic pub-
lished by Sebastian Bach, Melb., is as tedious as
ten cab-horses yawning in unison. People should
preach in prose : it saves time and temper and
much wear and tear of the Muse.
Coventry Patmore, who died the other
day at a long age, was a poet of some tender
thoughts and gracious phrases. But he lacked
scope and strength—ranging for a distance on the
heights of this characteristic couplet—
Mildred's of Earth, yet happier far
Than most men’s thoughts of Heaven are—
and climbing no higher.
Dec. number of The Austral Light, a
Melb. Catholic magazine, is specially sent for re-
view. This magazine always jumps painfully in the
hobbles of its creed, and this number is not so
good as some which have preceded it. George
Dunderdale’s article on “The Land and the Way
we Lost It ”is pithy, informed, and readable. P.
Moore writes interestingly on Art, and somer-
saults to an uninteresting religious peroration.
The remaining contents are dull or worthless.
Saturday Review : “ With all hia bril-
liance and accomplishment, Stevenson never pos-
sessed a style, certainly not a poetical style, which
could rank with that of the finest masters. His
incurable habit was to use language dispropor-
tionate to his matter, words raised to just one
power too high, to borrow a phrase from mathe-
matics. It was so adroitly done that no one could
call his style inflated ; but there was always mis-
sing the sense of reserve, of power waived.” Or,
as The Bulletin has more pithijy put it, the Man
was never quite big enough for the Phrase.
The Ballad of the Barber.
Here is the tale of Carrousel,
The barber of Meridian-street.
He cut, and coiffed, and shaved so well,
That all the world was at his feet.
The King, the Queen, and all the Court,
To no one else would trust their hair,
And reigning belles of every sort
Owed their successes to his care.
With carriage and with cabriolet
Daily Meridian-street was blocked,
Like bees about a bright bouquet
The beaux about his doorway flocked.
Such was his art he could with ease
Curl wit into the dullest face ;
Or to a goddess of old Greece
Add a new wonder and a grace.
All powders, paints, and subtle dyes,
And costliest scents that men distil,
And rare pomades, forgot their price
And marvelled at his splendid skill.
The curling irons in his hand
Almost grew quick enough to speak,
The razor was a magic wand
That understood the softest cheek.
Yet with no pride his heart was moved ;
He was so modest in his ways !
His daily task was all he loved,
And now and then a little praise.
An equal care he would bestow
On problems simple or complex;
And nobody had seen him show
A preference for either sex.
How came it then one summer day,
Coiffing the daughter of the King,
He lengthened out the least delay
And loitered in his hairdressing ?
The Princess was a pretty child,
Thirteen years old, or thereabout.
Sh ■ was as joyous and as wild
As spring flowers when the sun is out.
Her gold hair fell down to her feet
And hung about her pretty eyes;
She was as lyrical and sweet
As one of Schubert’s melodies.
Three times the barber curled a lock,
And thrice he straightened it again ;
And twice the irons scorched her frock,
And twioe he stumbled in her train.
His fingers lost their cunning quite,
His ivory combs obeyed no more;
Something or other dimmed his sight,
And moved mysteriously the floor.
He leant upon the toilet table,
His fingers fumbled in his breast;
He felt as foolish as a fable,
And feeble as a pointless jest.
He snatched a bottle of Cologne,
And broke the neck between his hands 5
He felt as if he was alone,
And mighty as a king’s commands.
The Princess gave a little scream,
Carrousel’s cut was sharp and deep ;
He left her softly as a dream
That leaves a sleeper to his sleep.
He left the room on pointed feet;
Smiling that things had gone so well.
They hanged him in Meridian Street.
You pray in vain for Carrousel.
AUBREY BEARDSLEY
Ernest Favenc’s boys’ story, ‘‘Marooned
on Australia ” (Blaekie), makes excellent timber
for local Xmas-boxes. There is a happy surfeit of
adventures among the 17th-century “ Indians ” of
Westralia, with a fine array of fresh corpses when
they front the Mongol invader. And every
decent boy smelleth the battle afar off, and saith
among the trumpets Ha, ha ! The author dedi-
cates “ to the memory of Edmond Marin de la

both an ardent geographer and an enthusiastic
student of the history of the Austral Continent.”

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir, —Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my, case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney."
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Gough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
success. I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured.—J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tamworth, N.S.W.”
“We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearue’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”—Signed
by Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong, and
69 other leading residents.

Dr. Gibbons
Having completed his New and Centrally-situated
Electrical & Consulting Rooms
Will be Pleased to Welcome his Friends
and Patients at
137 Elizabeth-street, SYDNEY.
Dr. GIBBOUS,
Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS Sc SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those Who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing symptoms, namely :—Frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fullness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shouldei-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
[ mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, Ac.,
&c., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually, to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.
On Receipt op 6d. in Stamps He Will Send,
POST FREE,
A COMPLETE MEDICAL WORK,
fully describing how all private, nervous, and
skin diseases may be quickly and permanently
CURED, without loss of time and money. This
book will be of great assistance in making you
thoroughly acquainted with these diseases so
common in these colonies, and may enable you to
restore some poor sufferer to health and happiness
after having lost all hope.
ONE POUND is Sufficient to Send
for Remedies necessary for the Cure of
DEBILIT Y,
And should be enclosed in the first letter.
Remember, “ Procrastination is the Thief of
Time.” If, therefore, you experience any of the
symptoms enumerated above, DO NOT DELAY,
your case requires advice, and you can either call
and consult the Doctor personally, or, if you
reside at a distance, you can sit down quietly,
in the privacy of your own chamber, and write out
a full description of your case, and send it by post.
DR. GIBBONS
will then write you a candid and straightforward
opinion. If, in writing, you do not feel compe-
tent to fully describe your case, send 6d. in
stamps, and Dr. Gibbons will send you, post
free, the Latest Edition of his Celebrated Work,
in which you will find a list of carefully-prepared
questions that will assist you in giving a true
description of your ailment.
NONE NEED DESPAIR,
as in every ease undertaken by Dr. GIBBONS
A Permanent Cure
is absolutely assured.
Dr. GIBBONS uses none but the very purest
remedies, and never, under any circumstances,
prescribes Mercury in any form.
PATIENTS are reminded that their LETTERS
ARE DESTROYED BY FIRE
immediately they have been read and answered,-
and that their cases and names will remain a
secret between the Doctor and themselves.
Dr. GIBBONS has documentary evidence of
having thoroughly CURED Thousands of Cases
during the extended time he has practised as a
Specialist in Australia.

“ If I were asked which single medicine I should

without it, and its general applicability to the
relief of a large number of simple ailments forms

Did you ever read about OLD SCROOGE and
the XMAS CAROL?
What was OLD SCROOGE like before he saw
MARLEY’S GHOST ? A miserable wretch,
begrudging a starving cur a lick out of the gutter,
the children their Xmas feast, and all mankind its
Xmas enjoyment.
What would you be like if you didn’t see
ANTHONY HORDERN’S
XMAS SHOW.
Not so bad as OLD SCROOGE, surely, for he
was a bad case indeed. But you would not, nay,
could not, be happy. Your heart would yearn
for something, and you wouldn’t know what. You
would be low-spirited, snappish, and bilious. There
would be no brightness in your eye, no elasticity
in your step, your weary feet would, be heavy as
lead, your flesh would fall away, and instead of
the sleek, WELL-GROOMED CITIZEN, a lean,
woebegone, CADAVEROUS PANTALOON
would OCCUPY YOUR PANTS and wear your
skin. Friend, don’t risk it, make a point of seeing

CIRCEAN TYPES.
1. —The Strange Woman.
Two types of Temptress you may chance to meet,
As forth you fare, on pleasure bent, my son.
An open trafficker in shame is one,
Who hawks her dubious wares from street to street.
Oft warm and true, a service not unmeet
At times she renders, though depraved, undone,
And lost, men deem her. Scorn her not ; yet
shun,
0 shun her and her kisses rotten-sweet!
Poor waif ! Not blameless, yet not all to blame.
Think : for a paltry coin she gives herself—
Her body and soul; the simulated breath
Of love ; her woman’s crown, her honest fame.
Pity the slave of Passion or of Pelf,
But seek her not. Her ways go down to death.
2.—And the Familiar.
No soiled dove, self-sacrificed is she,
The second Temptress with the Judas-kiss ;
But of the baleful serpent tribe, whose hiss
Is heard not till the victim, no more free,
Is held by strong, hypnotic witchery.
A flirt —a harlot of the mind —is this
Who deals in base, dishonored bills of bliss,
Yet robs her dupes of more than harlot’s fee.
0 doubly, trebly shun her ! Lewd and vile
At heart is she, though free from outward fault;
A Circe, without Circe’s saving salt
Of healthy lust. The lover whom her smile
Enslaves, einbrutes and hardens, never more
Tastes peace, or joy, or love’s delicious store.

LIFE.
Life is the wild and restless sea,
And Death the moveless shore
That hemmeth Life eternally,
And past its border none may see
Until for evermore.
Life is the caged bird’s joyless plight
By bars encircling bound ;
Death opes tbecage : with sweet delight
The captive soars in upward flight
And spurns the leaden ground.
Life is the sombre night and cold
Illumined by the moon ;
Death is the rising sun. Behold !
The shades are back for ever rolled,
Grief ever bringeth boon.
R.S.L.M.
STILL WATERS.
My dainty little Puritan,
How would you take it if a man
Dared to offend you ?
Your face—l may not call it sly—
But there’s a hint—l’m hanged if I
Can comprehend you !
O should I trembling trespass make
And kiss you for your own sweet sake,
I wonder whether
You would reprove that stolen kiss
Or tempt me into more than this,
Or—both together?
Yic.
WYVIS.
TO KITTY.
Sweet Kitty, with the sable hair,
And eyes as azure as the heavens—
Why do I carry everywhere
A mind at sixes and at sevens ?
Saying, “ Inimitable Kitty,
Can she be loving as she’s pretty ? ”
Often the wind-glades on the sea
Waver in momentary directions,
Unsettled as you seem to be
In your adorable affections ;
And as they blow and faint alternate,
Their meaning—no one can discern it.
Let the great tempest rise—and lo !
The ocean trembles to its oozes,
Stirred, all its elements overflow
In torrent that repression loses ;
So might it be, delicious Kitty,
Were you more loving and less witty !
Love shall breathe on the sleeping bud
That you have never found within you,
The leaves shall drown you in a flood
Of limpid witchery, and win you
Into a sweet surrender, Kitty,
That’s neither gratitude nor pity.

SATURDAY, DECEMBER 19, 1896.
The Democratic Victory.
The Maoriland general election has passed
over, and the Seddon Ministry remains in
power and is prepared to meet its third con-
secutive Parliament with what appears to be
still a solid working majority. It is a
seriously diminished one, it is true; but the
marvel, according to all the precedents of
party Government, is that there should be
any majority at all. The regular course of
proceedings is that each new Parliament
brings with it a new Cabinet. The Govern-
ment which gets such a solid majority to
begin with as Ballance and Seddon started
with in 1891 is rare ; the one which keeps its
advantage through the whole term of Parlia-
ment is still more rare ; and the one which
goes to the country and returns with a still
larger majority to last through a second Par-
liament is so unusual as to be a political
phenomenon. As to the Government which,
after serving through two complete Parlia-
ments, comes back successful to start a third
term of office, such a thing is almost beyond
precedent. In the regular course of events
the Ministry is decisively thrown out at the
first opportunity, and replaced by the other
party, which is also thrown out at the first
opportunity, the customary attitude of the
public being one of disgust at both parties,
tempered with a feeling that possibly the one
it hasn’t lately seen so much of may be a
shade less disgusting than the other one.
Therefore, the situation in Maoriland either
means that the Seddon Ministry is, in public
opinion, about the best Ministry on earth,
or else that the Opposition is such an un-
speakably loathsome Opposition that its
iniquity puts it almost outside the pale of
humanity.
* * * *
The signs are, however, that this is the last
Parliament which will be bossed by Seddon,
Mackenzie and Co.-—at least, for the present.
The solid Vxovernment majority has gone
down from about 25 to something like a
dozen, and, though the independent members
may raise the figures to 15 or 16, still the
Ministerial phalanx is evidently not quite
what it was. Unless something great and
unexpected arises to revive the jaded enthu-
siasm of the community, the 12 ought, in the
ordinary course of things, to disappear alto-
gether at next election, and the Tory party
should come back to power with a staggery
majority of one or two, and lead a precarious
existence for a while among the flesh-pots
and the portfolios. The Seddon Ministry,
to all appearance, is beginning to die slowly
of sheer weariness—the disease that every
Ministry dies of when it survives all other
casualties. A Ministry of archangels would
peg out from exactly the same cause under
the same conditions. If a Government is so
much above the average in honesty, brains,
enterprise, and democratic instincts that it
gives no tangible cause why the public should
want to get rid of it, it is still bound to die
at last because the community grows tired of
its mere continuance. The names of its
members, their portraits in the papers, their
voices on the platform, all become a cause of
offence ; the large “ S ” in front of the name
of Seddon and the big “ M ” before the cog-
nomen of Mackenzie grow to be a public
wrong, because people have seen these initials
so often ; and their owners have to go because
the human soul abhors hash and manna, and
everything else which is too often repeated.
Therefore The Bulletin opines that the
Seddon Cabinet is at last on the down-grade.
* * * *
Still, despite these probabilities, the pros-
pects of the Tory party in Maoriland are
miserably poor. It has come back numeri-
cally stronger than it was ; but, then, the
Government-party consists of those members
who are agreed to stand by the Ministry, and
the Opposition, while it includes all those who
are willing to oppose the Ministry, isn’t
necessarily agreed to stand by anything.
Also, it is still a long way from anything
even dimly resembling a majority. The head
and front of the Opposition is the old Tory
party which denounces all that Ballance
and Seddon have done, yet which got back
alive from the elections partly, at least, by
promising not to undo the alleged evils these
leaders accomplished. A Tory party which
exists partly on the votes it gets for being
wholly anti-democratic in theory, and partly
on those it gets by promising to be somewhat
democratic in practice, is good enough while
it is in Opposition and has nothing to do, but
when it comes into power and has to
adopt some distinct line of action, it
must alienate one or the other half
of its ragged regiment of supporters.
Another scrag-end of the Conservative
party consists apparently of the more aggra-
vated and incurable Prohibitionists. Their
vote was for sale to whichever party would
promise to grant the most desperate variety
of Prohibition, and as the party which is in
power and has to redeem its pledges imme-
diately can never promise so much, as the
party which is out of power and therefore
can’t be put to the test, the Tory faction
naturally bid the highest. The Ministry
had to pay cash ; the Opposition had merely
to give its promissory-note payable in three
or six or more years, and therein lay all the
difference. But when the promissory note
falls due the Cold Tea following must
get Prohibition or its vote will be lost, and
Prohibition means great loss of revenue, and
loss of revenue either means more taxation
on the poor which will alienate the popular
vote, or more taxation on the rich which will
make the Tories themselves desert the Tory
party, or immense borrowing which will lead
to more trouble later on. Therefore the
Cold Tea vote is another item which may
help later on to put the Seddon Ministry out
of power, and yet may make its successors
presently wish they had never been born.
Apart from these leading elements the mot-
ley party includes the casual individuals
whom Minister Seddon has quarrelled with
or Minister Mackenzie has aimed pickle-
bottles at in the course of their lengthy
official career, and all these together make a
brave show on the Opposition benches, but
as material to make a new Government out
of they are somewhat wanting in cohesion.
* * * *
Other matters also tend to strengthen the
Opposition in the present and do very little
good for it in the future. Maoriland is not
a solid community like N.S. Wales or Vic-
toria. It began as a number of separate
provinces, each with its Superintendent, and
its little farthing Legislature, and its capital,
and its finance, and its debt, and its Works
Policy, and all the rest. The provincial
feeling survived the abolition of the pro-
vincial system ; it survives to this day, in
fact, and is not likely to wholly wear out for
another quarter-century. All the larger pro-
vinces rage considerably against each other
over matters of finance, and the impossi-
bility of pleasing all alike accumulates a
steadily-increasing grievance on the head of
every Government. What is demanded is,
in effect, that each province shall get its
exact share, or rather more, of expenditure
according to the amount it says it contributes
in direct taxation and land, postal, customs,
excise, and railway revenue ; also that the
loan moneys shall be distributed with the
same ghastly accuracy. Therefore, the old,
rich provinces complain of undue expendi-
ture to open up the poor and new ones, and
the new ones want to know why the pro-
vinces which got all the money in the past
should also get it all in the future ; and
balance-sheets are produced showing that
every separate province is the most ill-used
one in the whole group. Finally, the repre-
sentatives of the more desperately aggra-
vated provinces begin to go into Opposition,
it being always understood in Maoriland that
the Opposition, when it comes into power,
will do absolute justice all round and fully
satisfy everybody. The longer a Ministry
is in office the larger grows the provincial
difficulty, and the louder the demand that the
Otago Central railway, and the Canterbury
Midland railway, and the North Island Trunk
line shall each be finished first, and that
every province will get all it wants before
any of the others get anything. And the
Seddon Ministry, having been in office longer
than usual, is beginning to get the provincial
difficulty on its hands in a very bad shape.
* * * •
Also, there are other political troubles
peculiar to Maoriland which every Govern-
ment collides with sooner or later. It has
the only war-debt in Australasia, and, as a
war-debt is represented by no revenue-pro-
ducing assets, thusadds seriously to the burden
of taxation. It was never blessed with the
splendid land-revenues enjoyed by some of
the other provinces, for a considerable por-
tion of its lands remained in the hands of the
native race, whereas the other provinces
annexed their soil bodily and proceeded to
turn it all into money. This reduced the
sources of revenue and further increased
taxation. The province has the same desire
for railways and other public works as its
neighbors. It doesn’t want further borrow-
ing, because it still remembers how Grey
brought it within half a hair’s-breadth of
default and insolvency. It doesn’t want
more taxation, being already, for the reasons
set forth above, the most heavily-taxed pro-
vince of the group. As a consequence, there
is probably, in Maoriland, a more intense
demand that the Government shall make
bricks without straw—good bricks and plenty
of them—than there is in any other of the
provinces. And the Maoriland Opposition
promises to make the bricks—it is in favor,
it says, of less taxation and the abolition of
borrowing, and a vigorous Public Works
policy, and a steady reduction of the public
debt—therefore, the dull, illogical section of
the community will probably drift in time to
the Tory standard. This is good enough in
the present, but as the Opposition proposes
to reduce taxation on its own special class—
the rich—and hardly dare levy more taxation
on the poor, it will almost certainly have a
huge deficit to struggle with whenever its
turn of office comes round, and its beautiful
programme is hopeless for the-simple reason
that a pint bottle won’t hold two quarts
under any circumstances.
* * * *
It is still possible, of course, that the
Ministry may survive this Parliament, and
that, the election of 1899 may give it another
majority like that of 1893. There are always
chances for a Ministry of such energy and
ability as that of Richard Seddon ; and its
present position is remarkably good. The
Bank of N.Z. is gradually righting itself
under State management. The State Land
Bank is doing well and seems likely to do
better. The Government’s policy of acquir-
ing and cutting up big estates is achieving
wonders. The B.N.Z. Estates Co. difficulty
is approaching a settlement; the Colonial
Bank scandal has died of inanition ; the
worst of the Midland Railway trouble seems
over; and ex-Treasurer Ward has gone
under, in a ministerial sense, with less
disaster than was expected. If all the State
enterprises keep on prospering, as they seem
practically certain to do, and the Old Age Pen-
sion and the State Fire Insurance schemes
can be carried through and prove as success-
ful as the rest of the Government’s under-
takings, it will be difficult to avoid recognising
the fact that the Seddon Ministry, despite
its faults, which are many, has more enter-
prise and genius and democratic instinct and
mana and good luck than any other Ministry
that ever existed in Australasia. Again, the
chapter of accidents has gone well with the
Government hitherto, and may continue to
do so. Its great stumbling-block, the Cold
Tea party, may prove, after all, to be only
a temporary accident. The Opposition
can hardly go on for ever without announc-
ing some sort of a policy ; it can’t live con-
stantly on the hazy statement that it
advocates the “restoration of confidence”;
and it can hardly present any policy which
won’t disgust some part of its motley follow-
ing. In fact, all the chances are in favor of
the Democratic Government remaining on
top for another six or twelve years—save
one, its own old age. That is a disability for
which there is absolutely no remedy.
The Efficacy of Prayer.
At the C. of E. Diocesan Sj'nod, held at Auckland on
Oct. 25, Archdeacon Willis moved : “ That the Bishop
be respectfully invited to ask the clergy of the diocese to
order a form of prayer to be used in all churches for
God’s good guidance to the people of the colony on the
occasion of the approaching general election for the
House of Representatives.” The President heartily
approved the motion, which was agreed to.
It is well that such things should be noted and
pondered, for they press home a fact of which we
are too apt to lose sight: that the forces of ignor-
ance and superstition are still immense, and that
even now, with all our civilisation, given but a
little concentration of those forces under the in-
fluence of enthusiasm or panic, but a little weaken-
ing of the defences of intellect, and the scanty
domain of science and enlightenment, so hardly
won, might once again be swallowed by the
wilderness of barbarism, as civilisations as grand
and but little less extended have been swallowed
up already. It is little more than 100 years since
the last heretic was burnt alive in Spain ; it is not
yet 200 years since Mrs. Hicks and her nine-year-
old daughter were officially hanged in England
for witchcraft; and assaults upon supposed witches
and wizards, occasionally rising to murder, as in
the recent Irish case, are not uncommon even
now. And though our children are taught to
ridicule the Chinese fashion of preventing the ill-
effects of eclipses by banging gongs to frighten
away the devil who is eating the sun, when
Halley’s comet appeared in 1456 it was regarded
as the dispenser of war, pestilence and famine.
By order of the Pope the church-bells of Europe
were rung to scare the monster away, and an
additional daily prayer was added to the supplica-
tions of the faithful. Whereupon (says Draper) the
comet slunk away into the abysses of space, terror-
stricken by the maledictions of Callixtus II L>
and did not venture back for 75 years. The faith-
ful were duly congratulated and comforted by the
assurance that, as in previous instances relating to
eclipses, droughts and rains, so also as regards
this “ nefarious” comet, victory had been vouch-
safed to the only True Church.
* * * *
The only true church and all the other true
churches have nowadays tacitly resigned jurisdic-
tion over comets and eclipses, though they
still claim considerable authority in the matter
of droughts and rains. The eternal and omni-
potent God is permitted even to send the earth
revolving round the sun, which He was prac-
tically forbidden to do by the bull of Pope
Paul Y. denouncing the Copernican doctrine.
As regards the Universe, there is not much doubt
that the Almighty is really almighty. But
when it comes to a question of sending a shower
of rain to Wagga Wagga, Omniscience is still re-
peatedly shown that it does not know its own
business, and Omnipotence works subject to the
advice and instructions of the Rev. Jeremiah
Blazes and his colleagues in the ministry.
» * * *
When you come to consider it, “ the efficacy of
prayer” is indeed a remarkable thing. Even
Christian children are nowadays taught that the
earth is one of the most insignificant of planets
chipped off a comparatively insignificant sun. But
they are rarely taught to try and realise the dimen-
sions of the solar system, or to understand that
other systems so far transcend ours as to reduce
it to microscopic absurdity in the great scheme of
things. Our sun is about 92 millions of miles
away from the earth—so far that, seen from
the sun, the earth is a mere speck, a dust-
mote so tiny that the dot upon this i, held
a couple of feet away from the reader, appears
several hundred times larger. Yet the very
nearest of the suns which we call stars, orbs
which crowd the heavens, orbs to which our sun
is hardly more than a gas-light, is 230,000 times
farther from us than the sun —more than 20,000
million miles away. And far beyond that stretches
an infinity of suns and stars until eyes and tele-
scopes can pierce no farther. Yet when an infini-
tesimal animalcule, on this infinitesimal earth,
wants a shower of rain, he has only to flop down
on his knees, and the Lord of all the Shining
Universes will dart like a meteor through infinite
space to do the bidding of the Rev. Jeremiah
Blazes!
* * ♦ *
More, He will turn back this universe to do
it, and snap the chain of cause and effect which
stretches from now to infinity. Eor the universe
is governed by universal law. In all human ex-
perience that law has never once been broken.
The moisture which the sun evaporates from the
sea is determined to the last drop by the heat of
the sun and the extent of the sea and the sur-
rounding conditions, and these to the last iota
depend upon precedent conditions, and these
again upon precedent conditions, and so back-
wards through eternity. The height at which
clouds are formed, the direction of the winds
which float them over the surface of the land,
the spot at which the clouds will condense into
rain, these are all a part of the inevitable result of
causes themselves the result of preceding causes.
While the law of cause and effect holds—and no
other physical theory is rationally conceivable —it
is as impossible for God Himself to create, to make
out of nothing, a single drop of rain as it would be
for the meanest of the emmets who pray to Him.
* * * *
Similarly with the election of representatives to
M.L. Parliament. A voter is what he is, partly
because his father and mother were what they
were, and because their fathers and mothers were
what they were, and so on backwards to infinity.
And he is partly what he is because he has been
educated in a certain way, and fed on certain
foods, and has been subjected to this and that in-
fluence as he has gone through life. In a word,
he is the product of heredity and environment, and
his heredity and environment having been so-and-
so, his conduct in any circumstances must be such-
and-such. There is no room for the interposition
of Deity, unless Deity breaks the first of its own
laws—the law that effect invariably follows cause,
and corresponds in nature and extent with the
nature and extent of the sum-total of causes.
Constituted as a man is, and moved by the motives
which do actuate him, he cannot help voting for
the candidate for whom he does vote. It is logical
and intelligent to bring fresh influences to bear
upon him, to give him fresh motives, with the
object of turning his vote in any particular direc-
tion, but appeal to God to effect a sudden and total
change in the character of a “ bad ” man, so that
he will vote for a “good” candidate, would be
supremely ridiculous-even if it were proved that
there is a God after the pattern of the churches,
and that He had taken a specific interest in human
affairs.
* * * *
The fact is that the reign of law is acknow-
ledged even by the superstitious in proportion to
their knowledge. It is only when causes are
obscure, or not comprehended, that Divine inter-
position is sought with regard to effects. It is
comprehended even by pious people nowadays
that a comet is merely a star moving in a regular
and calculable course, and probably no civilised
person, religious or not, dreams of praying to God
to alter its course as religious people prayed in
1456. But little is generally known of physical
science, and pious shepherds, as ignorant as their
flocks, have no scruple in praying for an alteration
in the quantity of moisture evaporated by the sun
from the sea, or an alteration in the rotation of
the earth upon its axis which would cause a wind
to bring clouds over Wagga Wagga, or Warwick,
or Mount Gambier. And it is well-understood by
shepherds, at least, that discredit must not be cast
upon religion by praying for things which will
furnish a definite test of whether prayer is effica-
cious or not. If you pray for rain all over Aus-
tralia, a shower is bound to fall somewhere ; but if
Archdeacon Willis, who moved the resolution at
the Dunedin synod, fell down and broke his leg,
he would certainly not pray to God to come and
set it. That would furnish a definite test of the
value of prayer; but it is recognised that there is
no use in asking God to set broken legs. The
Archdeacon would send for a doctor right away.
Yet it would probably be a good deal easier for
God to miraculously set a broken leg than to
miraculously alter the constitutions, and disposi-
tions, and brains of a large number of M.L. elec-
tors.
* * * *
In 1881, when President Garfield lay dying,
every Christian in the United States was ordered
to pray for his recovery. Such a unanimous blast
of prayer went up as very seldom went up on


this earth before. And Garfield died. The
other day all the Christian Endeavorers in the
U.S., more than 100,000 strong, prayed for a week
together for the conversion of infidel Ingersoll.
Precisely at the same hour every day they all
went down on their marrowbones and wrestled ler-
vently with Satan on behalf of Ingersoll.
Ingersoll watched the farce humorously, re-
gretted the waste of time, and announced at the
close that he was rather more of an infidel, if any-
thing. In all cases where the results of prayer
can be appreciated, they are uniformly nil—as is
to be expected. As there are at least two chances
in any given contingency, it is obvious that prayer
must sometimes seem to win. There are two or
three faith-hospitals in England, and admission
was once sought to one of them for a patient with
the broken leg which Archdeacon Willis would
take to his doctor. “No;’’was the. reply, “we
only take chronic diseases.” That is, the faith-
cure is only applicable to cases in which the
patient may get better anyhow, without opera-
tion.
* * « *
Savages and children (who are savages), and
the very ignorant religious (who are also savages)
put the faith of the calculating praying-man to
shame. Savages pray for definite objects, and
whack their God over the head when He does not
grant them. Little Johnny prays for a kite, or a
ball, and is grievously troubled when the Omnipo-
tent makes no response. And very ignorant
religious people, who really believe in their Bible,
and do not pick and choose its doctrines to suit
their convenience, don’t take their sick to the
doctors, but call for the elders of the church to
pray over them, as enjoined in James v., 14. The
patients frequently die (there was a case in S.A.
recently), and then the professing Christians of
the land denounce the real Christians, and fine, or
imprison them, for holding a faith in prayer which
they have given up themselves because they know
it’s no good. And then these same professing
Christians go and pray for rain, or for the conver-
sion of stupid or wicked electors, and prove that
their own ignorance is just as dense, only a little
less Scriptural. Prayer as an aspiration, as an
ecstasy, as an unburdening of the soul to the Un-
known, is not irrational, and is apparently bene-
ficial to certain qualities of the complex thing that
we call human nature. But prayer as a petition,
as a begging, prayer for rain as a lazy man’s sub-
stitute for irrigation, prayer for a new heart for
M.L. electors as a substitute for education and
social and sanatory influences, is utterly useless
and ridiculous.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Naval Squadron Swindle.
In 1887 a wave of lunacy passed over Austra-
lasian legislatures. Several leading politicians
had been bought and sold at the Imperial Con-
ference, which decided it was time Australians
began to share the burdens of the British Em-
pire; and when they came home they did their
best to secure acquiescence in the shameful bar-
gain of the Naval Defence Bill. Only in one
province, Queensland, was there substantial
opposition. Backed up by the dutiful Courier,
MTlwraitii used the Bill as an election cry,
and denounced an agreement which “ will
not only bind us down for a term of
years to pay tribute to Great Britain,
but will also implicate us in the risks
of war which she runs with other
nations.” Then “Betsy and I made up,” the
Griffilwraith arose in all its ignominy, and
Queensland passed the Bill four years late.
This measure, to which Australasia’s Imperial-
istic legislators were bribed and cajoled to
assent, is probably the most foolish compact
ever made in the history of these provinces.
All our war risks come through Britain ;
Britain’s sole concern is to protect the hundreds
of millions of British capital here invested ;
yet we must actually invite attack from
Britain’s European enemies by paying annual
tribute to support a British squadron ! The
seven leaky-boilererl vessels, of which four
attend the Melbourne Cup and three rust
continually in harbor, cost £700,000 to con-
struct, and in these days of 2| per cent.
Consols this represents to J. Bull an outlay of
£19,250 per annum. He charges Australasia 5
per cent, on the capital cost, or £35,000 per
annum, so that £15,750 goes towards a sinking
fund to help pay of! the original cost. This
charge is quite independent of up-keep, for
which Australasia pays £91,000 per annum
additional. We pay for the maintenance of the
vessels —repairs to hull, machinery, masts,
yards and rigging; we pay for ammunition
and torpedoes ; we pay for victuals,
stores, and medicines—-the sailors’ pants,
and the gold lace on the officers’ caps.
And in return what have we ? The
right to say not one little word in control of
either men or ships. The Admiral of “our
fleet ” gets his instructions, not from us, but
from the British Admiralty ! This is not
taxation without representation ; for it is
worse—it is taxation for somebody else’s re-
presentation. In six years, we have al-
ready paid away £756,000 more than the
whole squadron cost—and nothing to show
for it ! There is a promise that the fleet is to
remain in Australian waters—a very safe pro-
mise, seeing that they who made it can break it
when they please ! How much exactly would
that promise be worth in time of war ? One
cheerful Admiral has told us that Australia would
probably be best defended in the China Seas. An-
other suggested that “our squadron” might be
w'anted to reinforce the British Channel fleet !
And now it is reported by cable that a pro-
minent British statesman has said that, in case
of war, the British Admiralty will use “ our
fleet ” where it pleases. We may have it in
time of peace when it isn’t needed for Aus-
tralian defence; in time of war, when it is
needed to save our cities from attack, we have
it on the best authority that the fleet we pay
for will probably be away helping to save
Hingland from invasion, and we will take our
chance. Luckily, this wondrous agreement lasts
only four years longer. But it is cunningly
drafted : it is to persist unless specific notice is
given by the Australasian Parliaments two years
before the date of termination. The fact that
notice ought to be given grows more and more
conspicuous every day.
A Large Legal Muddle.
Anyone who carefully studies the N.S.
Wales Landaninkum Tax Act must come
to the conclusion that the lawyer is the worst
lawmaker going. The proverbial coaeh-and-
four enactment is a fool to this lawyer-made
statute. There are gaps in it which would take
a furniture-van and a mob of brumbies without
stretching. For instance, section 42 provides
that the Commissioners, before proceeding to
give notice to taxpayers, must complete an
assessment-book, which, under section 31, must
contain names of owners and descriptions of
land to be taxed, with full particulars. Having
completed this book, the Commissioners may
then proceed to give notices, &c. How, at pre-
sent, not half the information required for this
book has been obtained, so that it cannot
possibly be completed. As a matter of fact, it
is alleged that no such book has ever been com-
menced, so that all notices sent out so far are
probably illegal. This appears to be a gap
which admits of a large amount of traffic. The
point as to the Court of Review seems to indi-
cate an equally wide thoroughfare. Section 44
gives taxpayers who have received notices of
assessment to which they object 30 days within
which they can appeal to the Court of Review.
Now, a large batch of notices was issued on
October 23rd, yet no Court of Review was
gazetted until November 18th, leaving only
four days instead of thirty in which taxpayers
could appeal. Landowners “ out back ” could
not even get the announcement of the appoint-
ment of the Court until after the time in which
appeals could legally be lodged had expired.
This must break the Act all up if any attempt
to enforce payment is made in such cases. Even
an Australian Court of Equity would issue an
injunction against any such unjust action.
The promise of the Commissioners to regard
objections as notices of appeal is a breach of
the Act. When Parliament says appeals must
be made to a Court of Review, no little tin god
in the Public Service can set that aside and say
appeals can be lodged somewhere else. The
question of notices opens up still another rent
in this charming Act. Under section 47 the
tax is payable on a date to be gazetted, and the
Commissioners may sue for the amount if not
paid 60 days later, or, under the amending Act,
00 days later. The Commissioners gazetted
October 23rd ns the day on which the tax must
be paid. They can therefore sue on January
21st. Now, not half the notices are yet
issued, nor can the balances be completed
for some time, probably not until January.
But in any case all taxpayers who do not get
their notices next week at latest cannot have
their 30 days clear within which to appeal.
This must upset the legality of all late
notices. The idiotic flaw in the Act which
makes “the present ” Customs Chief Powell
first Commissioner, with no provision for
resignation or further appointments, makes
a fitting climax to the muddle. No won-
der lawyer Makinson is going to fight
all 115 cases entrusted to him, that Rhada'
manthus Heydon has already been briefed to
fight a test case, and that the whole Loranorder
party is going about arranging coaching teams
to gallop through the Act. Altogether, as the
early and late notices under the land-tax are
obviously illegal and the middle ones very
doubtful, the situation is about as muddled as
it can be. And this is how lawyers make law.

Wanted—A Crown Defender.
A certain unconsidered aspect of the Glen-
brook (N.S.W.) tragedy is worth considering.
Suppose one of the victims of Butler or
Harwood or whoever it was—there is no legal
proof yet against anyone in particular, but
it certainly was someone, and for the purpose
of this argument he may as well be called
Butler as Cholmondeley or Mephistopheles
—suppose the aforesaid victim—a man with-
out money or influence—had come on top
in the struggle and killed that man of many
aliases in self-defence. The absolutely correct
and right-minded thing under such circum-
stances would be for him to give himself up
and tell his improbable tale to the police. He
would be locked up. The police and detectives
would hunt up his antecedents and probably
prove ugly circumstances in his past history.
Being locked up, he couldn’t search for
evidence to disprove them, however false
they might be. Also, he couldn’t, in his
cell, dig up the dead man’s past career,
on which the whole case would hang. The
detective force engaged for the prosecution
might hunt up the smellful record of the corpse,
but as its business would be to find evidence
against the prisoner it would more likely leave
the matter alone. There is no detective force
provided on the side of the defence, so the
matter would continue to be left alone, unless
the prisoner was rich enough to hire a special
detective service of his own. The rest of the
story unrolls like a panorama. Trial—the
charge (supported by the police, detectives,
Crown Law department, State Prosecutor,
police-witnesses, and the evening newspaper
horror) being that the ruffian in the dock had
treacherously murdered the benefactor who
provided all the money for the prospecting trip,
and otherwise befriended him. Evidence to
prove that the prisoner, or someone else of the
same name, had previously been in trouble for
assault and other things. Unless the prisoner
is called Phlxynotrms it is almost always
possible to mix him up with the misdeeds
of some other person of the same name, and if he
is named Phlxynotrms it can generally be
shown that his real name is Smith, and the
previous convictions of Smith are as numerous
as the sands on the sea-shore. Found guilty—
there being no evidence on his side except his
own entirely uncorroborated statement, which
was too preposterous for belief. Sentenced to
death amid general execration. Hanged amid
ditto. That is how things would almost cer-
tainly have gone in New South Wales ; there-
fore, the man who kills another in self-defence
where there are no witnesses would do well to
bury him deep and silently beneath the wattle,
and then light out at his best pace for parts
unknown. The chance of the other man, if he
had killed Butler in a disagreement down
a gully, would have been almost as bad as
Butler’s if it is proved that he killed the
Other man. And if the other man hadn’t
killed Butler, but merely crippled him
with a shovel in self-defence, he might have
been tried in the same way, and Butler’s
evidence against him might have made his con-
viction all the more certain, and he might
have been hanged for attempted murder just
the same. Until there is a Crown De-
fender as well as a Crown Frosecutor, and a
detective force to work up the defence as well
as the prosecution, the inadvisability of the
other man leaving Butler —or whoever it was—
alive when once he got on top is sufficiently
evident, and the advisability of finishing him
off with the shovel, and making him as unrecog-
nisable as possible with the crowbar, and then
planting him very deep down under a grassy
mound, sticks out conspicuously. The man
who takes any chances with Australian criminal
law, unless he has much money behind him, is
a madman or some new kind of suicide.
The “Meejum.”
In a recent issue The Bulletin explained,
in re the U.S. Presidential election, that it
didn’t believe in the silver craze of the Bime-
tallic League, and since then a storm of litera-
ture about the “ meejum of exchange” has
raged around this office. Most of the “ meejum ”
cranks write to say that they are sorry for The
Bulletin’s ignorance, and state that it is going
back on democratic principles because it doesn’t
see why any community should pledge itself to
buy the product of the bloated silver-mine-
owning capitalist at more than its value. The
following is an extract from about the most
coherent letter of the heap :
I am sorry to see The Bulletin joining in the chorus of
“Yah” against. Bryan and his followers. If ever there
was a “ Fat Man ” party in existence it is the party which
has partly bounced and partly cajoled the electors of the
United States to vote the M’Kinlky ticket. I am certain
that your attitude is the result of misapprehension, espe-
cially on the currency question. Few writers go deeply
enough into the currency question to get to the root of
the matter. The world’s currency should have expanded
with the world’s expanding trade. Had it been left to
itself, that is to say, had both gold and silver continued
to be coined into money of full debt-paying power, the
currency would have thus expanded. The demonetisation
of silver in 1873, however, contracted the world’s currency
by nearly one-half when it most needed expansion.
Hence the fall in prices whioh makes industry in gold
standard countries unprofitable and causes capital to be
unemployed.
The Bulletin is deeply grateful to this and
several dozen other writers who are sorry for
its ignorance, and offers a few suggestions in
reply. (1) Silver was not demonetised in 1873,
as the silver cranks persistently allege. One or
two countries abandoned, or partially aban-
doned, the silver standard then, or about then ;
others did it previously; some, like Austria
(1892), France (1870), and India, did it later ;
some, like Mexico and China, stick to silver to
this day, and the United States actually ex-
tended the silver currency after ’73. The
“crime of 1873” is only a catchword, and a
pretty thin one at that. (2) “ The world’s cur-
rency should have expanded with the world’s ex-
panding trade.” Well, it did. Commerce more
than doubled between 1860 and 1890. The world’s
supply of money also more than doubled.
“ The demonetisation of silver in 1873” (which
didn’t happen) didn’t contract the currency ;
the currency went on expanding. (3) Also, the
great recent fall in prices began in ’65, not in
’73; the fall from ’65 to ’7O was far larger,
taking the world all over, than that from ’7O
to ’B3. Further, this paper doesn’t see why
the masses should barrack for the silver Fat
Man any more than for the gold Fat Man. The
silver Fat Man says he represents the cause of
the poor, but every Fat Person who wants to
use the poor for his own ends says the same
thing, and it wants to be supported by better
evidence.
The discovery of the bodies of Preston and
Weller, the carefully-buried victims of the
Glenbrook assassin, has moved quite a lot of
people to moralise over the old, threadbare
maxim that “murder will out.” It is a com-
forting maxim in a sense, and tends to keep up
a belief in law’norder and establishes a sort of
idea that Providence personally lends a hand
to hunt up the assassin, but it is a rather stupid
maxim all the same, and rests on no visible
evidence whatever. All the public really knows
is that the murders it knows of do come out ;
the murders it doesn’t know of naturally don’t,
because if they did come out it would know of
them. The two bodies which have been dis-
covered in the neighborhood of Glenbrook are
evidence, of a kind, that murder will out; the
innumerable bodies which haven’t been found
at any number of other places are equally good
evidence that it won’t. The fact that no one
knows whether there are any bodies at these
other places, wherever they may be, is con-
fronted by the equally solid fact that no one can
prove there are not, and, unless someone can
prove there are not, then the comforting maxim
goes bung. All the evidence is that murder
simply takes its chance of coming out, like any
other crime. It comes to light very often
because the gun makes an awful noise in going
off, and the bloodstain is large and red and
obvious, and the remains are cumbersome and
heavy and take a long time to decay. And it
very often doesn’t come to light, inasmuch as
in 1894 there were 25 known murders in New
South Wales against only six convictions, and
how many murders there may have been which
were not known is mere guesswork.
Victorian Assembly’s attempts at insolvency-
law amendment are getting the usual kind of
opposition from “ respectable ” Fat Man in the
Council. The Lower House was for ruling
that no uncertificated insolvent should be en-
titled to obtain credit to the amount of <£2o
without notifying his insolvency to the firm he
was dealing with. Cornelius Job Ham “ con-
sidered this most un-English legislation, even
though it was in the English act,” and Fat Man
collectively would have none of it. He refused
to draw a line at the higher amount of
,£5O. Nothing less than full rejection of
this un-Hinglish British clause would satisfy
him, so the clause was struck out. An uncer-
tificated insolvent, under the present law, is
allowed to trade upon the ignorance of any mer-
chant who may happen to be unacquainted with
the gentleman’s commercial past. When the
gentleman has obtajned all the credit he can
get in his seeming character of a “ good mark,”
he is at liberty to stop payment again
without filing his schedule. An uncertificated
insolvent cannot be made any more bankrupt
than he was before. He stands on velvet as
regards his new creditors. They trusted him
at their peril. The law that operates against
an ordinary trader doesn’t operate against him .
He’s all right. And the Vic. Leg. Council,
being mainly composed of sanctimonious shuf-
flers and persons of weak, money-making intel-
lect, desires to preserve the uncertificated
insolvent from any sort of obligation. The
Council, in short, was asked to pass a clause
requiring a wholesale purchaser of goods to
state privately an all-important commercial
truth about himself when there should be
urgent reason for its private announcement,
and Fat Man, otherwise the Council aforesaid,
cried “ Truth be damned ! ” What the Hupper
’Ouse requires is a Bill to make truth a penal
offence.
The collapse of the Labor-party at Dunedin
(M.L.) election is another proof, on top of
thousands which went before it, that no cause
is much good which hasn’t its own press organ
to keep it before the public. Pinkerton and
Earnshaw, the two defeated members, were,
with the exception of the Victorian, Tren-
WITH, about the straightest and ablest
Labor politicians in Australasia. Earnshaw,
some years ago, beat the heavy and antiquated
Larnach out of sight. It was as big a surprise
as when the late Goliath was homicided by a
certain youthful party who is still at largo. In
those days Labor had an organ of its own in
Dunedin, but that little journal pegged out
from want and neglect about ’93, and ever since
the local press has been wholly Tory. For
three years the Dunedin papers have carefully
“educated” the people in the ways of the
National Hass, with the result that Dunedin
has gone back to Scobik Mackenzie and that
other battered campaigner, Henry Smith
Fish. Considering how weary the country was
years ago of Mackenzie and Fish, the resur-
rection of that pair of tired failures is a
remarkable episode.
Sad are the political uses of agricultural
shows. At Whittlesea (Vic.) the other week a
few local Tories gave their voice of the country
its annual shout over the show luncheon. One
Walsh, addressing himself particularly to
half-a-dozen of the fattest graziers in the dis-
trict, said : “No one present would think of
claiming for the present Parliament that it was
a reflex either of the wealth, the industry, or
the intelligence of the country.” It had made
awful strides towards Socialism (murmurs of
“ Down with dynermite ! ” from several choice
specimens of wealth and hintelligence), and
would have burst up the country but for the
wisdom of the Hupper House, which “ re-
flected in the truest sense the feelings and
interests of the best portion of the com-
munity.” This excited consumer of pro-
vender having sat down, Robert Harper
rose (and Staugiiton, M.L.A., after him)
to acknowledge that Walsh’s remarks,
although severe, were quite justified. Parlia-
ment, according to Harper, does not represent
the people— i.e., “ the best portion of the com-
munity,” and he is quite sure that many of their
proposals are not in accordance with the people’s
wishes, &c., &c. The Whittlesea game is
worked at every place where horses, cattle, pigs,
and poultry assemble and meet together once a
year. It is the game which J. B. Patterson
worked during his brief burst of champagned
Government, and it has become so notorious
that an agricultural show nowadays is thought
of as a function whereat dumb animals are in-
troduced casually in the interests of other
animals who want a chance to get their land-
owning sentiments unduly reported.

The drollest opponent of early-closing on Satur-
day seems to be a Vic. Leg. Councillor named
Melville, who asks : “Is the Government
going to deprive the people of the enjoyment
of Saturday night in the way they have grown
up to it ? ” The “ people ” referred to by this
lamentable creature are Melville, M.L.G., and
all others who, under previous conditions, have
been able to walk abroad on Saturday evenings.
For their enjoyment the shops ought to remain
open as of old. They have grown up to what
Melville would call the cheerful blaze of gas
that glorifies late shopping, even as the Saxons
of 800 years ago grew up to the habit of ex-
tinguishing all lights when Curfew sounded.
It would astonish Melville, M.L.C., to learn
that the history of civilisation is one eternal
story of some people being deprived of the chance
to do something which other people had long-
time objected to. Sunday was the great day for
public sports in Merrie England, and the toil-
ing population grew up to enjoy themselves
accordingly, but the Government ordered the
blessed Sabbath to be kept holy, since when
small shop assistants have been expected to
work and pray without any weekly burst of
recreation. Yet, if The Bulletin were to ask
Melville, the Scawtchman, whether it was
right of the powers that used to be to suddenly
deprive the masses of their old-established en-
joyments, Melville aforesaid would answer
“ Yes.” In his opinion the Lord disapproves
of Sunday sports. Well, in this journal’s
opinion, the same Lord is in favor of a uni-
versal Saturday half-holiday, notwithstanding
the fact that Melville, M.L.C., hasn’t grown
up to it.
Dear Bulletin, —St. James’s Gazette calls
attention to the humbugging system of London
Postal Department in delivering on telegram
forms the city “ telegraph ” messages which are
transmitted from office to office by pneumatic
tubes. These pneumagrams, it is contended,
should be charged for at certainly not more
than 50 per cent, of the genuine wire rates ;
also, the original paper lodged by the sender
should go right along to the addressee, instead
of being re-copied at the receiving office and
delivered under false pretences by a telegraph-
messenger. In Paris it has long been the prac-
tice to deal honestly with tube correspondence,
and the complaint of the cockney newspaper
begins to be echoed in Melbourne, where the
fraudulent farce of issuing a “ telegram ” copy
of a document that was partly blown anil
partly sucked to its official destination is in
harmony with other post-office scandals lately
brought to light.—F.

Zola’s “Therese,” the last great effort of
the Potter-Bellew co. at Sydney Lyceum, was a
really great affair. As an artistic but rather
verbose combination of devil, nightmare and de-
composed green spook it lays over most dramas
badly. It is the story of a young couple who
marry in Act 111. (when the bride proceeds to un-
dress on the stage), but between her and her hus-
band there constantly arises the vision of her late
husband—a weedy, babbling creature whom they
drowned jointly a year before, as an impediment
to their love. His spectre has haunted them ever
since, and it haunts them worse as time goes on—
a spectre with two inflamed eyes above a thin red
nose, and a thin catarrhal nose above a loose,
foolish, slouchy mouth and a green necktie. The
spectre grows specially active on the wedding
night; the happy pair talk about him with shud-
ders as they wander round each other half-dressed
in the bridal chamber, and about how they shoved
him under, and how unpleasant he looked when he
was found a week later, and how his ghost takes
its dripping walks at night to see them. The
deceased’s mother, stepping in casually, hears the
story, and is struck all of a heap with paralysis.
* * * •
Thereafter they make a happy family of
four; the newly-married couple, the ghost, and
the speechless paralytic who can only glare. The
husband and wife degenerate rapidlyin this society.
The husband becomes drunken and unshaven —a
shaking ma,ss of nerves and starts and jumps ; he
grows uncivil, and doesn’t change his collar re-
gularly. The beautiful Therese gets to be slovenly,
cross, and unkempt and knotty about the hair.
When she lays the table for the evening meal of
the drunk and the ghost and the general paralytic,
she dashes the plates anyhow on the untidy cloth
and throws the spoons promiscuously at anything,
and drops the thin soup around as one in an angry
dream. They curse each other over the meal, and
talk in shuddery whispers about the bloated state
of the late husband when he was fished out of the
water. Through all their married life they have
really talked of nothing but the bloated state of
the late husband. When evening falls and the
ghost begins to actively pervade the premises, and
the only light is the baleful glare in the eye of the
paralytic, they threaten to murder each other
and have their regular evening family con-
vulsions; and tie themselves in knots on the
carpet in the presence of the soup and the
ghost and the frozen mother. The gentleman
decides to give himself up and be comfortably
executed, and the lady helps him so enthusiasti-
cally to rush otit of the room on his way to the
police-station that they get jammed in the passage.
Then they each decide to kill the other, but it
doesn’t come off. So the shadows deepen, and
they call each other more dreadful names, and
gibber worse than ever about how they pushed
the late husband’s foolish head under water —and
at this moment the paralytic mother recovers, and
uses such _ awful language that they hurriedly
commit suicide. The one falls dead with his head
to the north and the other falls dead with her
head pointing to the south, and the ghost of the
decomposed one is laid, and the horror is at rest.
* * » *
Whatever Mrs. Potter cannot do, she cer-
tainly can do the dreadful Therese admirably.
The unutterable gruesomeness of the character
seems to suit her, and she rises to heights, or
depths, or something, that she has never reached
before in this country. The gruesomeness of the
other character seems to suit Kyrle Bellew equally
well; they degenerate beautifully together, and
have mutual family fits on the carpet in a manner
that is both powerful and impressive. The re-
mainder of the very small cast —said remainder
being Wilson Forbes, Oily Peering, Berkeley,
Mrs. Hill and Miss Polly Emery—is generally
satisfactory. “Therese ”is hardly likely ever to
be a popular play, but there are more creeps and
shudders to the square inch in it than in almost
any other place outside Bedlain, and that is at
least something.

Good old “ Called Back,” at Sydney Royal,
is doing rather better business than might have
been expected considering that the drama is now a
long way past its first youth. It depends merely
on Paolo Macari, and Rignold’s Macari is, in some
respects, a gratifying conspirator. He is large and
heavy and slow ; some of his speeches are
delivered with wearisome deliberation, and at
times it becomes a matter of wonderment why
any intelligent Czar should employ so painfully
gradual an agent. G. Rignold putting his feet
down with a solid clump in the paths of vice is
indeed an impressive spectacle. But even with
these drawbacks Paolo Macari is a finished ruffian.
There is high art in his leer, and his scowl,
and his soft insinuating voice, and his
large, wormy smile, and his impressive
crawlsomeness, and though he wouldn’t
Bhine much as a real spy because he has gallows
and grease written large on his countenance, he is
all in the way of a stage spy that could reasonably
be asked for. The fact that he is the villain,
however, is much too conspicuous ; his big black
eye-brows and moustache, and his mass of black
hair, and his murky hat, and his big, sombre
frock-coat, and the absolute blackness of his whole
outfit make him look like a huge blob of ink upon
the landscape. No one could look so desperately
black without being a sinner of the worst descrip-
tion. Plimmer’s hero is very good indeed all
through. The new heroine, Miss Emily Hughes,
is a moderate success ; she is pretty, and as
the deranged girl in the limelight she makes
a graceful picture, and there are patches of
strength in her rendering of the character, and
also patches of the other fellow. The Bulle-
tin hangs up its judgment until it has further
considered Miss Hughes. Miss Eanny Reynolds,
as a widow decorated with gin and peppermint,
and the clever Miss Watts-Phillips, are two dis-
tinct successes. Also good old Stirling Whyte,
the personage with the wail in his voice, is about
the most conscientious old man who ever tottered
with a long white beard along the road to Siberia.
The biggest scene in the piece is that in which
Stirling Whyte in his casual rag and his long
white hair and with a dishcloth on each foot
throws himself up in the Siberian atmosphere like
a great quantity of snakes, and curses Macari
with that robust curse which finally takes him in
the back in the last act. And the second best
scene, in The Bulletin’s opinion, is that in which
Macari in a garret unbends his great mind by
thinking aloud about cats.
* * * *
The “ Milk White Flag,” at Her Majesty’s,
originally put up for one week only, struck so vast
a patch of luck that it was extended to three.
To-night (Thursday) is now advertised as the.very
last, but as the boom still continues it is impos-
sible to say for certain that some more new
arrangements won’t be made at the eleventh hour
and the “Flag’ be further prolonged. The
reason of this great boom is not wholly apparent.
There is a vast amount of gold lace and military
hat in the play, also a lot of detached wit, a good
deal of interesting satire, some respectable music,
and various other things. Still it is a great deal
of something about nothing, and a very limited
quantity of nothing at that; it hasn’t even a
semblance of cohesion; and there is a serious
want of feminine interest in it. The corpse on
ice has something to do with its success, and so
has the Napoleonic Conor, and the melodious
whistle of Frank Lawton holds it up materially in
a rather weak place, and the irrelevant high-kick
of Bessie Clayton fills another great void where
otherwise the cold wind of criticism would blow
through. Further, the co. rushes its absurdity
along with a whoop and a bang which leave no
time for serious-minded contemplation, and among
all these reasons the “Milk White Flag ” is a big
success for no cause in particular. Having
got which lucid remarks off its chest, The Bulle-
tin devoutly trusts that its readers know what it
means a good deal better than it does itself. After
vigorous consideration of the “Flag,” no paper can
be expected to understand its own meaning to any
extent. The most distinct feeling which
Hoyt s comedy-sparkle leaves behind is a vague
idea that one has been humorously kicked on the
head by a horse in an opium-vision.

Carl Hertz has returned to Sydney Tivon,
which is now crowded up with talent. Coleman
and Alice Leamar are on hand at one and the
same time. Those breakneck artists, the Vaidis
Sisters, who are whirled round up by the roof
hanging by one tooth to a flying trapeze, and who
walk head-down wards like the domestic fly on the
ceiling, are also there, and are still at the pinnacle
of their glory. It is a pretty high pinnacle, too,
and if one of the sisters falls off it and comes
down head first

James MacMahon’s cinematographe in
Pitt-street, Sydney, is as healthy as ever. The
other cinematographe has removed from the Cri-
terion to new quarters at 478 George-street, and,
so far, the demand for cinematographe seems to
keep both shows going. All the little casual shows
which come from no one knows where, and rage
for a brief season at Xmas-time, and then vanish
again, are also beginning to be heard of, but these
necessary evils are hereby let off with the usual
caution.

A swell Hebraic amateur co., mostly
named Levy and Cohen, and partly described as
Abrahams, and also alluded to in places as Marks
Baumann, gave three representations of
Mikado ” last week at Sydney Criterion, in aid
of that deserving charity, the Moses Montefiore
Jewish Home. The general result was better than
that of most amateur co s and quite as good as
the work of some alleged professionals. The
chorus was above par, and though no one stood
out like a tower among the leading characters, the
co. maintained a general level of decided respect-
ability. In fact, it might play “Mikado ” a few
more times without the sudden death and burial
of anybody becoming urgently necessary.

The new Sydney Palace of Varieties
(it hasn’t yet opened) seems already to be the scene
of considerable not and disorder, and the manage-
ment is reported to have been throwing itself out
of the unfinished building with a good deal of
enthusiasm. Sometime last week a very large
stout gentleman advertised that he was lessee of
the premises, and that the opening would take
place on the 26th, and a smaller stout gentleman'
with a soft hat advertised that he was the lessee
and that the opening, irrespective of what the
other stout gentleman might say, was fixed for the
19 th. Two different managers were also announced.
Each of the conflicting parties was understood to
say that he was the only authentic stout gentleman,
and that the other one was entirely bogus, and
that his signature wouldn’t be recognised
Finally, however, the trouble seemed to
simmer down at least, only one advt. appears
now—and the opening is fixed for the 19th ;
and what it was all about is still practically a
mystery As there are no teeth-marks on the ear
of any of the parties concerned, a certain amount
of decorum was evidently maintained, even when
the trouble was at its worst.
** * *
Brough’s season at Melb. Bijou is conclud-
ing with a trial gallop of “ Nancy and Co.,”a farci-
cal comedy in one medium-sized first act. followed
by three brief outbreaks of madness. Augustin
iJaly, the Murkan manager, whilst evolving
Nancy and Co.’" from his inner consciousness of
a dozen other such comedies, introduced a some-
what original leading-lady part for the famous
Miss Ada Rehan. This is the character (here
played by Mrs. Brough) of a soulful young
matron who—under a masculine alias, and
unknown to her husband—collaborates by
Post with a young man in writing a play.
When she gets news that their joint effort is about
to be staged, the authoress comes along in a state
of excitement to reveal her identity to the
astonished other fellow, and a secret interview
between them leads to a whirl of compromising cir-
cumstances. The literary lady in question is not
too improbable to be humanly interesting, the
other characters are lively fictions, and the rush of
events travels on old familiar lines at express
speed. Sometimes the fooling is almost exquisite.
Here and there, on the other hand, a conjic situa-
tion seems puerile rather than droll, but, taken
for all-and-all, this is a promising entertainment,
likely to improve rapidly in effect when the B.
company has it well under control. Seven Mel-
bourne performances and further rehearsals should
give “ Nancy and Co.” a fair chance to become a
big success in Sydney. It was already a consider-
able success last Saturday.
Mrs. Brough offers a sufficiently natural
suggestion of Nancy Brasher, the clever warm-
blooded woman in love with a commonplace,
jealous husband. Also Harry Roberts, making
his debut with the company, drops easily into his
place as Nancy’s literary partner. His style
might be a little lighter and broader, but it
couldn’t be more pleasant and unforced than at
present. In fact, Roberts appears certain to go
on and prosper exceedingly in the new engage-
ment. Titheradge devotes himself chiefly to
hunting for imaginary proofs of his wife’s mis-
behaviour, and kicking at the doors of eccentric
chambers where somebody is hiding from his
wrath. Brough is a baffled amateur detective and
disseminator of false suspicions in a long brown
coat. Certain other principals flit around pro-
miscuously, or sit concealed under rugs ; and
scenery for the four acts is supplied by a couplß of
•inexpensive interiors.

“One of the Best’' has progressed, favor-
ably at Melbourne Royal these last few weeks.
Bland Holt’s gaudy drama came in a time of hot
weather when the average spectator gave his
patronage under protest, and the effort of follow-
ing the plot was rather too much for him, but
since the temperature began to abate the reputa-
tion of the braw Heelan’ leg-show has risen
steadily. On Saturday the drum and fife band
played with great intensity to a crowded house,
therefore “ One of the Best ” may be expected to
feed the managerial exchequer until Xmas. It is
full of items which improve on acquaintance. Bor
instance, Mrs. Bland Holt, bringing desi>atches for
the hero in the ta-ra-ra pocket of her “ rationals,”
appears to get nicer every time one sees her. The
military manoeuvres on foot work more smoothly
and the supers, as a rule, betray a growing interest
m the fate of Walter Baker, who, for his part,
seems less painfully conscious of his undressed
limbs and overwhelming headgear. Moreover, the
fact that there are no battles, murders, or gallant
rescues attached to the present Royal panorama is
so utterly astounding that it can’t be fully grasped
within the limits of a first visit, and a person
needs to go twice before feeling certain on the
point.
#* * *
“ Stars of All Nations ” retired sadly from
the Princess’s last week, leaving the stage free
for a fortnight’s rehearsal of the Firm’s Xmas
annual. A terrible freak of variety-show was
perpetrated towards the close of the “ Star’s ”
season. A stoutish little lady in a green-satin cos-
tume sang a ditty concerning a little yaller coon,
and, when the refrain had been sundry times re-
peated, an irrelevant boy, popping up by private
arrangement in a private box, sang it once again
without accompaniment from the orchestra.
The boy, who was a poor little vocalist at his best,
cracked on the top note, but, under any musical
circs., the spectacle of the green satin lady getting
assistance from this unexpected quarter (at the
Princess s, of all theatres) would have given public
sentiment a shock. Luckily, there wasn’t much
audience on hand to witness the act of sacrilege.
* * * -*
“ Matsa, the Fire Queen ; or &c., &c.,” is
the name finally bestowed upon the Firm’s panto-
mimic extravaganza, and, judging from the length
of the title, a fortnight’s rehearsal will be found
rather too short than otherwise. Further parti-
culars next week.

At Melb. Opera House the boys, also the
adults, have taken very kindly to Chirgwin, and
that old-established study in black-and-white is a
large success. Time has robbed the tall Kaffir of
his original leanness, but all his other characteris-
tics remain as before. He sings fetcbingly through
his nose, and is an artist on manv instruments ;
and in several particulars. Chirgwin, as a lot of his
present admirers will remember, has given the
same sort of entertainment for about 20 years
without exhausting his popularity, so it is prac-
tical ly useless to question his cleverness. Only
the fittest survive to any great .extent on the
public stage.

Les Frferes Eclair, the excellent “ crocodile and demon ’
of hitzgeraid’s circus, write to protest against a Bulle-
tin comparison between the work done by Mdlle Clotilde
Antonio and their more muscular selves. The sin of this
journal lay, apparently, in the remark that young Clotilde
(who appears at the Palace Theatre, Sydney, on Saturdavl
performed at Melb. Princess’s the same business as the
Eclairs accomplish and more besides. Now, if the young
lady does not walk head downwards with her body curved
like that of the alligator aforesaid, and does not support
herself by her teeth like the demon in question, The Bul-
letin will gladly call itself a liar. Anyhow, this life is
too short for drawing nice distinctions’ between feats of
contortion.
One of the cavalry horses cast for a part in Bland Holt’s

The sudden disappearance of Arthur Garner’s name
fromadvts. of the new variety-show at Melb. Princess’s
was very generally remarked. At the outset this out-of-
place enterprise was all Garner; then it became less
Garner, and finally the ex-Triuinvir faded right away.
Brough, when he engaged Arthur Roberts, wanted
sister Laura to play a boy-part, but the young lady
couldn’t persuade herself to wear trousers seriously, not
even in farcical comedy. As Little Billee, in the “ Trilby’’

other sex.

Clifford Ferley, Melbourne’s prize theatrical benefit
organiser, who has more enthusiasm to the cubic inch
than others to the cubic ton, has just received from the
police department a certificate for heroism displayed in
assisting four policemen to capture a gang of roughs and
midnight prowlers in Russell-street. Cliff, violently
arrested the ringleader “ on his own,” and held him in an
iron grip till the police came up and handcuffed him.
Cliff ought now to organise a testimonial benefit to him-
self, under vice-regal patronage, as a mark of public
esteem of his bravery.
The weird drama recently staged at Her Majesty’s
(Sydney) isn’t by a long way the first snake drama Aus-
tralia has seen. The lamented Johnny Hall took to this
branch of art once, and staged a production in which Alt.
Boothman had a desperate hand-to-hand encounter with
18 feet of infuriated python. It was Boothman’s great
scene, and the first night he waded in so desperately that
he cut the snake to flinders and emerged covered with
glory, applause, blood and mangled boa-constrictor. The
management remonstrated privately about the excessive
damage done to the animal, and Boothman promised to
be more careful of the next one. Second evening Alf.
and the new serpent charged each other, and the former,
again carried away by the situation, reduced his an-
tagonist- to unrecognisable sausage-meat inside 16 rounds.
Then the management decided that it couldn’t afford
to keep Boothman supplied with a new serpent every
night, and changed the bill.
South Australians curse the present drought for more
reasons than one. All over the blighted land amateur
dramatic eo’s are hurling “The Curse of Drink” and
“ Ten Nights in a Bar-room” at unoffending citizens, who
are prevented from killing the performers because the
proceeds are “ for the distressed farmers.” Why Heaven
has seen fit to kill the farmers’ cattle and wither the crops,
and yet spares the amateur actor, is an inscrutable
mystery.
There is one Sydney man who curses long and loudly
the cineinatographe. In his amiable, husbandly way he
took his wife to see the cin. (new abbreviation), and in the
Sunday afternoon disembarkation scene at Manly, his
better half saw what she believed to be her husband com-
ing ashore with another lady. To be the more convinced,
she saw the tableau fully half-a-dozen times with the aid
of opera-glasses. The accused male indignantly denies
everything, but, as he cannot prove a complete alibi for
that particular Sunday afternoon, and his wife won’t
entertain the idea of an “ extraordinary likeness,” there
is a big storm in the once happy ’ome. The possibilities
of the cin. as a worker of mischief to supposedly upright
people are. great.

The private depositors of the Queensland
National Bank have a really solid grievance against the
Government for the “ assistance ” it rendered to that
dreadful institution. Roughly speaking, the Govern-
ment has £4,000.000 in the institution ; the public about
±'4,500,000. But the Government has a prior claim, there-
fore all the loss falls on private depositors, unless the whole
of the private deposits are insufficient to cover it; at all
events, private deposits have to be exhausted first. The
Q.N. directors have fooled away, so far as is known, about
one-third of the deposits. Presumably they fooled away the
Government and private money with the same beautiful
facility; therefore the situation is as follows : If there
had been no State support the deposits would have
been about 41 millions, and when the directors
‘blewed” one-third of it there would be three
millions left, or 13s. 4d. in the £. State support gave
these fatuous directors B*4 millions to play with instead
of 4*4- The loss of one-third therefore makes nearly three
millions gone. The State’s prior claim saddles the whole
of this on to private depositors, therefore State support
reduces their assets to about 6s. Bd. in the £. If there
are more revelations to come, which is quite possible
the whole of the private deposits may be swallowed
up in the general shortage. If there had been only pri-
vate deposits to deal with even the most awful directorate
on earth couldn’t have stolen or fooled away quite all of
them ; it must have left enough to pay a dividend some-
where. Supposing the general deficit runs to 11s. in the
£, however, the whole of the private depositors’ money
will go in making good their own and the Government’s
deficit.
The Government got the same rate of interest as
private depositors, and the private depositors were com-
pelled to guarantee repayment of its inonpy to the extent
of every cent they had in the bank without receiving any
payment for this stupendous risk. Government “sup-
port ”in the past just about doubles their loss. Which is
one solid reason why any Government should start a State
Bank, and keep its money there at its own risk. No State
has any right to go round swindling private depositors in
this fashion.
The Bulletin hereby retracts everything it has
ever said about the advisability of keeping the Q.N.B.
afloat. A complete return shows that there are 7702
private holders of interest-bearing deposits to the amount
of £4,180,000. Of these 4430 depositors and £2,719,000 of
the money belong to England. Therefore, the proposal
to hand the institution over to the depositors only means
creating another English bank in Australia, and
increasing the permanent mortgage of J. Bull on this un-
happy country. There are already five Australasian
banks bossed in London : the Union, Australasia, E.S.
and A., London, and National of Maorilaiul. The Q.N., if
the proposed arrangement is carried out, though its
nominal head office will probably be in Brisbane, will
make six. And considering that there is already a great
deal too much British financial institution in this country,
and too much British mortgage, and too much tendency
to have everything done for us by our dear brother Bull,
the Q.N. Bank had better shut up and end its utterly dis-
creditable career for good. Other Australian banks have
lost their capital and reserves, and yet go on ; but so far
every one which acknowledged its inability to pay its de-
positors has shut up and the directors, as a rule, have been
tried —and acquitted. Even in smellful Melbourne the
law went through the form of trying Davies and Loader
and their colleagues. Therefore, precedent, so dear to
the soul of every Upper House, demands that the Q.N.B.
should close up’ and that directors Hart, M.L.C., A. H.
Palmer, K.C.M.G., M.L.C., Morehead, M.L.C., and Web-
ster should be proceeded against forthwith. If they
object, all Tub Bulletin can say is that the spec-
tacle of three M’s.L.C. refusing to follow precedent and
demanding “ rash and experimental legislation ” in their
own interests, is a lamentable affair.

Brisbane Worker publishes what purport to be
extracts from two speeches by Minister Tozer as reported
in Hansard. On 4th August, ’96, Tozer is represented as
saying: “ I have had sufficient confidence in the Queens-
land National Bank to leave my money in it. The best
proof I can give of the sincerity of my belief that the bank
is solvent is that I risk my all in it.” The second extract
represents the same Tozer on Ist December, 1896, saying :
“ I have not the slightest pecuniary interest in connection
with that bank.” If both these extracts are solid fact,
then there is something touching in the picture of Tozer
solemnly attesting the solvency of the wretched bank,
and stating that he was backing his opinion with a good
part of his fortune ; and then the same Tozer, a very short
time afterwards, getting clear of the concern that he had
such beautiful confidence in. If Tozer really assured the
public that his faith in the Q.N. Bank was so vast that he
trusted it with his hard-earned pile, and other people
trusted it on the strength of that assurance, and then
Tozer got out silently and left them still trusting, what
kind of a moral claim have these people upon Tozer sup-
posing anything goes wrong?
One thrilling proposal made by Finney,
M.L.A., in Queensland Parliament was to the effect that
the State should accept from the Q.N. Bank a composi-
tion of 13s. 4d. in the £ and call things square. This
would mean dropping over a million, and Treasurer Nel-
son, with the fear of his next financial statement before
his eyes, sat on the proposition instantly. Also Dickson
objected to it on the ground that such an arrangement
“ would create an impression that the bank couldn’t pay
20s. in the £.” Which was a gorgeous piece of bluff.
The report of the Govt.’s own committee of inquiry
says distinctly that the Q.N.B. can’t pay 20s. in the £ or
anything like it.
* * * *
Thus the Capricornian (Rockhampton) on the
Q.N.8.: “ But the man in whose hands lay the manage-
ment of the bank till the beginning of the present year,
and who therefore was primarily responsible for all
errors, has passed beyond human reach." Again, dear
friends, the man who is dead !
* * * •
The case of the Dominion Banking Corporation,
of Melbourne, was unearthed again the other day in the
law-courts. The Dominion was a very strange and awful
bank which died an unnatural death. It had a nominal
capital of £3,000,000 in 600,000 shares, but only 70,000
seem to have been taken up. The co., in fact, seems to
have been mainly C. H. James, the long-haired “ Father
of the Land Boom,” who held 68,179 shares out of the
70,000. When it burst, a meeting, which was naturally
almost wholly 0. H. James, appointed a liquidator and
gave him absolute power, among other things, to “com-
promise all calls and liability to calls.” Thus the liquida-
tor (largely appointed by 0. H. James) received (partly
from C. H. James) power to accept from 0. H. James, if
he felt so inclined, a halfpenny in the £ of his
immense liability. The liquidator called on 0. H. James
to pay up £171,399, and James, it is alleged, hasn’t done
so up to date. Until James pays the shareholders will
probably get just about nothing, as the other shareholders
amount to practically nil and are largely insolvent.
Therefore, an English creditor, who had over £20,000 in
the hopeless institution, asked Judge Hood : (1) That the
co. should be wound up under supervision of the court,
instead of by the liquidator so largely appointed by C. H.
James ; (2) that if C. 11. James doesn’t pay up his calls he
be made insolvent like any other individual, and asked to
explain where his property has gone to. The court, how-
ever, didn’t seem to like laying a hand roughly on the
“ Father of the Boom,” but it yielded so far that if
the liquidator proposes to compromise with James
the aforesaid English creditor shall have due notice, and
may be represented at his own cost in any argument that
ensues. Which is very comforting.
The full balance-sheet of the London Bank of
Australia proves to be quite as bad as the cabled sum-
mary represented. The result of the half-year’s opera-
tions was a net loss of £232, and, as the bank also paid a
dividend of 554 per cent. (£4728) on preference capital, its
funds decreased £4960 as the result of six months’ work.
Why any dividend at all was paid, seeing: there were no
current earnings to pay it out of, is not very clear. This
leaves only £10,936 to show as the accumulation of three
years, during which the original capital has received
no dividends. The contingency account (which is really
the reserve-fund of the old bank set aside to meet losses)
has been gradually fading for some time, and now
the remaining £331,000 is deducted from the assets in one
fell swoop. This, according to the report, is done “to
meet the requirements of probable legislation in Victoria.”
As the only probable legislation in Victoria which has anj r
apparent bearing on the case is the Companies Bill, pro-
viding for more stringent audit, and the Credit Foncier
Bill, this is rather unaccountable. The London Bank is
now negotiating for better terms from its reconstructed
depositors, and, all things considered, it seems to want
them.
* * • •
Vic. Commissioners of Audit report that for
the year ended 30th June, 1806, the Victorian public
debt decreased by £372,000, and the annual interest bill
was reduced by £11,544. This sort of thing is so wildly
unusual in Australian finance that it ought to be framed.
* * * *
According to the Commissioners of Audit, the
Vic. revenue received during last financial year was
£6,458,000; ordinary expenditure during same period
(not counting £250,000 in reduction of public debt),
£6,006,000; surplus, £452,000. That is how things would
have panned out if the accounts had been kept on N.S.W.
Premier Reid’s “ cash basis,” and if Turner had been on
the same dodge he would have had much the larger sur-
plus of the two. G. Reid’s finance is mostly small dodgery
with a view to making things look sound when they
aren't.
• • * *
For the first five months of the present financial
year the N.S.W. revenue has been £220,000 less than for
the corresponding period of last year. Also, so far ex-
penditure is £168,000 ahead of revenue, which looks bad
for the promised surplus.
Of the N.S.W. 3 per cent, local stock .£207,000
was taken up in October. Then for November the sales
only amounted to £54,000. Treasurer Reid, however,
still reckons on getting £1,000,000 a year. When J. Bull
was content in ’95 with £3 4s. per cent., £3 per cent, cer-
tainly ought to be enough for any common, degraded
cornstalk.
* * * *
The Maoriland local .£500,000 loan at was a
success, though with no great margin. The amount
offered was £508,000, and the loan went off at a small
premium. The direct saving by local flotation is about
£7OOO in expenses, the cost of remitting the half-yearly
interest, and the Bank of England “ management ex-
panses ; ” also, there is a further indirect saving through
the retention of £17,500 a year interest in the country.
Further, the Government retains the right to pay off the
loan at any time between 1907 and 1922, which gives a
margin of 15 years for conversion. Considering that the
last M. L. loan floated in London had to be fixed for 50
years, and taking all the other circumstances into account,
Maoriland seems to have done quite as well in the local
market as it did in London.

That heart-breaking institution, the Sydney-
Permanent Freehold Land and Building Co., is recon-
structing some more. It first reconstructed in 1891,
getting its deposits extended for a lengthy period at 5 per
cent. Then it reconstructed again in 1895. It agreed to
pay the half-year’s interest, falling due 24th March, 1895,
in six half-yearly instalments of Bs. 4d. per cent. Future
interest was to be reduced to 2f, per cent., and, for two
years, payment at even this reduced rate was to be sus-
pended, the amount due being added to the principal.
Payment of the principal was postponed indefinitely.
Now, by way of a third reconstruction, the institution ap-
parently admits that it can’t even pay the small instal-
ments of that old half-year’s interest, which has been due
ever since March, ’95, and it proposes that its recon-
structed deposits shall henceforth bear no interest at all,
that interest now due shall be added to principal, and that
the principal shall be repaid at the rate of Is. in the £ at
any time between now and the end of the world, when
there is enough money on hand to provide the Is. afore-
said. The Sydney P. F. L. and B. Co. owes £134,000 of
deposits, and its £250,000 of alleged assets apparently
yield about 1 per cent, all round. As the chairman says
that liquidation wouldn’t pan out for more than 17s. in
the £, it would seem that even he reckons that £llO,OOO
of the assets are only paper-value. Taking it all round, a
reconstruction which stops payment of all interest and
fixes the principal indefinitely is about the largest order
on record. Even Jd. in the £is at least a great deal more
definite.
* * * *
The balance-sheet of Melb. Grand Coffee Palace
shows a profit for the half-year of £534, which is rather
over 1)4 per cent, per annum on capital. This is so much
better than some recent returns that the half-yearly
meeting ought to have been a cheerful affair, but a gloom
was cast over things by a shareholder who denounced the
balance-sheet, and alleged that the co. had really
made a loss. He also demanded an immediate winding
up, but was badly defeated. The rest of the meeting was
largely row and personalities, and indignant explanations
by a person named Murphy. As the malcontents were
left quite unsatisfied at the end of the meeting, it is ex-
pected that at next half-yearly gathering proceedings
will be opened with an axe.
* * * *
The National Trustees, Executors, and Agency
Co. (Melbourne), one of the very few Vic. trustee com-
panies which has always kept its head above water, pre-
sents a very respectable balance-sheet. The profits for
the year, after providing £l6 for depreciation of the
tables and chairs, and the" big iron safe, &c., in the office,
are £2986. Then in the insane desire to keep up its
record the board pays the usual 10 per cent, dividend
(£3000), and consequently a prosperous year’s work leaves
it £l4 to the bad. Last year the net profit was £3OOl,
and the same dividend left it just £1 to the good. The
year before the net profit was £2813, and the same 10 per
cent, dividend left it again £lB7 to the bad. Conse-
quently, the National Trustees have gone backwards
£2OO in three good years solely through the 10 per cent,
mania. The co. has £30,000 capital and a solid reserve of
£23,400, but £43,000 of these funds are invested in mort-
gages, which are always a more or less uncertain item.
Also, there are considerable risks about the trustee busi-
ness, which require a large margin to cover them, and
apart from everything else the payment of dividends
which are not fully covered by current earnings is a fool
of a business at ali times.

N.S.W. pastoralists are beginning to feel bad in
these lean times over the exorbitant charges of the Sydney
woolbrokers. The situation is a complicated one. Sup-
pose a clip of 200 bales, each 4001 b., or 80,0001 b. in all,
to be worth absolutely 6,' t d. per lb., or £2083 6s. Bd. In
the first place, the seller is charged one-eighth of a penny
per lb., or £4l 13s. 4d. Then the buyer is charged one-
eighth, or another £4l 13s. 4d. The next trouble is that
the buyer at auction must go up by bids of a farthing per
lb., therefore, if he is prepared to give only 6Jd. net he
must necessarily bid only 6d., and the odd eighth of a
penny thus sacrificed means the loss of another £41135.
4d. Then on the £2OOO actually realised by the wool there
is a deduction of 1) per cent, commission, or £3O. Con-
sequently, the account sales pan out as follows Value
of wool, £2083 6s. Bd. Less £41135. 4d. charged to seller ;
£41135. 4d. charged to buyer and deducted by him from
his bid; £4l 13s. 4d. further deducted by buyer on ac-
count of rule limiting him to farthing bids ; £3O commis-
sion ; net result, £1928 6s. Bd. In other words, charges
amount to 5)4 per cent., and another 2 per cent, is casu-
ally lost by the wayside, as it were, making 7)4 P er cent,
in all. On very low-priced wool the selling charges alone
run as high as 10 per cent. No wonder the pastoralist is
beginning to kick against the wool-broking iniquity.
A. J.S. Bank shares {£7 10s. paid up), buyers,

The “ restoration of confidence” again.
Evidence in the case of the late City Treasurer
of Sydney, Arthur J. Speer, charged with the embezzle-
ment of £725, disclosed the extraordinary fact that an
account (called the City Treasurer’s account) had not been
audited by the official auditors or anyone else since 1890.
Speer alone had absolute charge of it and gave no state-
ment of it to anyone, the auditors not even knowing of
its existence. This, it was pleaded, was the usual custom.
The account was one into which contractors’ bonds and
over-paid rates were paid. The total deficiency was said
in evidence to amount to about £2500.

The record of Block 14 for the year indicates
plenty of energy. For 11 months the mine sent away
46,000 tons of mineral products, of which 10,601 was car-
bonate ore, 13,733 sulphide concentrates for smelting,
8274 sulphide slimes for smelting, and 11,538 tons concen-
trates for shipment.

The Junction continues to take out far more
than a fair proportion of the richer ore —absolutely more
shipping ore, in fact, than milling ore.

Block 10 made a net profit last half year of
£5740. The co’s financial position is fairly strong; its
surplus of liquid assets (mostly “ sundry debtors ”) is
£26,583. The cash in hand at the end of the half-year
was within £5OO of enough to pay off liabilities. The
zinc tailings, which it is proposed to sell, are not taken
credit for—and very rightly, though they do average
12oz. silver and 5 per cent, lead per ton. It is the 34 per
cent, zinc that damns them.

This year’s Broken Hill dividend-total will
amount to £540,000, independent of Tarrawingee,
Stephen’s Creek (B.H. Water Supply, Ltd.), and divs. in
respect of sales of properties outright. Of this total, the
B.H. Prop, is, of course, by far the largest contributor,
with £432,000 against its name ; then B.H. Junction with
£55,000, ai.d Block 10 and Block 14 with £20.000 apiece.
The just-started Junction North has scattered £12,000.
Official figures for Broken Hill are, so far, avail-
able for only nine months of this year : to the end of Oct.
the output actually exported was valued at £1,286,877.
Each quarter showed an advance on its predecessor : the
third quarter’s figures were just over £450,000. The
British has got to work in the fourth quarter, and the
Block 10 and Central new mills have been set going in
Nov., so that this last quarter’s outturn should leave the
half-million well behind. In which case, the year’s
exports will reach £1,800,000. Up to the end of Nov.,
this proportion had been more than maintained.

An attempt is likely to be made to get some of

The Victory mine, Purnamoota (near Broken

Orange (N.S.W.): “ The Prince of Wales mine

Highland Mary, Swamp Oak, N.S.W., owned

possession they have crushed 1147 tons for 35570 z., and
are now running through their final crushing, from which
it is said about IOOOoz. are expected.

The New Bushman’s mine, Parkes (N.S.W.),
can barely keep itself out of the mud. From the last
report it would seem that even 50 tons of poor ore brought
down the average of a six or eight weeks’ crushing. It
must be hard up for an excuse. The vein in the winzes is
looking well, but as these are below the bottom level, the
shaft must be deepened before it can be worked. It will
also, sooner or later, want a new shaft entirely. It would
be interesting to know how Messrs. Baxter and Saddler
came out of this magnificent amalgamation.

518 tons, 3470 z. This is about the lowest average the
mine has shown for many years. No profit in this, as
indicated by the price of the shares. When is that
English concern, the Garibaldi, going to crush ? What,
too, has become of the Baker’s Creek Extended ?

The nominal capital of Westralian mines on the
London market is £66,261,000, and the dividends thereon
for last two years were £292,000, equal to about five shil-

about half-a-dozen mines, four of which are now dead or
thereabouts.

The Forrest Govt, rose to the occasion in dealing
with the jumping of the Hainault co’s lease. It was de
dared forfeited by Govt. Gazette notice for non-payment
of rent. The shares of this London Co. fell at once from
£2 to 10s. The London papers teemed with references to
the insecurity of mining titles in W.A. A panic was
threatened. No delay was allowed. A Cabinet meeting
was held, followed by an Executive, and the forfeiture
was annulled. The trouble, it was alleged, arose by mis-
take. But what about the jumper? Under the law he
came into legal possession. He was not a jumper in the
ordinary sense. The moment a lease is thus declared void
it is Crown land, open to anyone, and having gone into
possession he has a good cause for compensation against
the Govt.

Coolgardie : “ Ten tons of stone from the Fre-
mantle Consolidated returned 1870 z., and before the

capital. Much better to get gold out of London than out
of the mine !

The Lady Loch mine, Coolgardie, has lots of
newspaper defenders in London. “ There is not one atom
of truth in the rumor that the reef has cut out," says the
Mining World. But is it not a cold-blooded truth that
the rich chute which produced nearly 3000 oz. from 800
tons is exhausted ? If not, why have the shares fallen
from ±'3 15s. to 265. ?

Cue (W.A.) “ Victory United —145 tons, 3680 z.”
Splendid if it can be kept up. The haphazard crushings
of nine-tenths of W.A. mines have helped to knock the
bottom out of the boom. Calculations were based on the
regularity and uniformity of toe Band returns. Now it
has dawned on Bull that the continued presence of a bat-
tery is more than the average W.A. mine can stand.

Modest Maryanski, mining expert, got himself
into a state of excitement over the finding of telluride
of gold in the Boulder Main Reef mine. He says : “It
Betties for ever the doubt that existed, all over the world,
as to the continuity in depth of the rich ore bodies en-
countered at Hannan’s. The rich gold of the 80-called
lode formations has come from the decomposition of the
telluride of gold. The discovery will improve, immediate-

future of gold mining in the colony, and will result in a
new mining boom, but on a sound and solid basis.” It is
always the new boom that’s going to be solid. The old
boom is always tacitly admitted to have been rotten. But
what has become of the bodies of rich telluride in Block
46 and other mines found many months ago ? Modest M.
seemed to have been unaware of their existence. M.M.’s
declaration has caused another telluride shriek by news-
papers.

Ironclad M. Co., Pilbarra, W.A. : “The chair-
man said there was nothing to do but to wind up. Nothing
had been left undone to make it a profitable venture, but
the property had proved valueless." Another great news-
paper mine.

At last the Fortune of War mine, W. A., has

know at present is, what has become of the other mines
examined and recommended by these great experts, par-
ticularly those around the General Gordon, the scrip of
all of which are at an alarming discount.

Croesus No. 1 North: “At the 100 ft. level the
lode is 25ft. wide and averages from 5 to 7oz. to the ton.”
Then why in Heaven’s name don’t they crush ? News of
this sort is never believed now till supported by a crush-
ing, and it is a waste of money to send it, and of space to
print it.

Lake View, one of the few great mines found in
Westralia : 720 tons, 19190 z., also producing 10 tons of
concentrates, worth 350 z. to the ton. The sulphurets
found in opening up the 200 ft.-level are good enough to
ship, and above there is a big body of ore which, for a
great length, will mill an average of 3oz. It should become
a very big producer in a few months.
Great Boulder, 708 tons, 21220 z., distinguished

A cheerful report of the Kangaroo mine on the
Murchison : “ A premature and primitive battery, erected
nearly two years ago, only crushed a few weeks. The
mine has had much exemption, and was almost jumped

and the whirlwinds have distributed these well over the
country.”

The half-yearly statement of accounts (to 31st

elegantly-printed publication in an eau de Nil tinted

liquid assets, and proclaims the manager’s comforting
belief that the property will be a “highly payable mine”

The share market closed weaker than at Nov. 1, but with
some promise of recovery for Xmas. The biggest yield
was Brilliant’s—3o39oz. from 2634 tons, paying a 4d. div.

An odour as of violets, which renders
drowsy the atmosphere of Collins-street, Melb.,
at Saturday “ Block ” time, has been a source of
much puzzle lately. The secret is a new lady’s
cordial, which is simply gin flavored with orris
root. This revelation knocks the basis out of
much amatory poesy.

Old dead Governor Phillip’s statue was

while two bronze allegorical figures attached weigh

“ The Bowlahmine tragedy. Bullet extracted from Smith’s head at the

that the murderer will recover. He has been placed under surveillance,

that he would yet ‘cheat the hangman.’”

cal figure of the I O U for the borrowed money
with which the bill was paid apparently hasn’t
yet come, and the fact that the interest will weigh
at least eight tons on the chest of posterity isn’t
once alluded to. The two allegorical figures which
haven’t turned up yet are said to represent Agri-
culture and Commerce, but this is probably a mis-
print for Agriculture and Cohen —the latter being
a delicate allusion to the fact that the money was
borrowed in Hingland.

Just before the Maoriland election, one
candidate was openly accused of cruelty to his
wife, and a hurried meeting of his supporters was
held to consider how to refute the calumny. Then
a committee of about 120 lady electors sat in
secret, and cross-examined the candidate’s wife as
to his habits, customs, morals, and general pro-
ceedings. Also, it is alleged, on bad authority,
that they inspected the lady carefully all over in
search of footmarks and welts. Finally, they
reported the charge to be wholly groundless, and
all was well once more.

Melb. Social Purity Society lately raised its
periodical wail about that tender, misguided bud,
the local flower-girl. This time, however, it re-
ceived a bad shock. One interesting child in short
frocks and with flying hair proved to be 23 years
of age, married, and the lawful mother of two
bounding infants. And the society was just ask-
ing for legislation to compel her parents to keep
her off the cruel streets, and to send her to bed
every night at eight.

Dear Bulletin, —What think you of an
undertaker’s hearse being seized on the way to the
cemetery for debt ? This happened in a far West
town not so long ago.—D.S.
A Sydney news-
paper promulgates
the idea that “ main-
tenance men” (i.e.,
men who cannot or
will not support their
wives) are, when in
Darlinghurst, on the
debtors’ side of the
gaol. That is not so.
The “ wife-starver ”
is shaved,shorn, and
dressed like the worst
criminal in gaol. The
warders know noth-
ing of a m a n’s
offence, the uniform
making all equal.
The only advantage
a wife-starver has is
that he cannot be re-
moved from Darling-
hurst to any other
gaol, because he may
at any moment be
eligible for release.

The grievances
of Melbourne tram-
employes smoulder
continuously. Long
hours and short pay
excite universal dis-
content. The trams
have been working
long enough now to
supply the older
hands with samples
of the quaint diseases
that lack the nerves
and joints of the
man who spends half
his time on a jolting
car. Varicose veins
afflict a large percen-
tage of the conduc-
tors. “ Look here,”
said a conductor to
the writer, the other
day, producing a bag
of flour from under
the seat, ‘‘ I have to
carry this about with
me now. Many of
our fellows have to
do the same. When
the veins get very
bad, we dab on a

Just about the time when Staughton,
M.L.A., drew a scornful distinction between the
Vic. Liberal parties and “ respectable people,”
Mrs. Staughton entertained the 400 leaders of
“ respectability ” in honor of Miss Jessie Staugh-
ton’s formal introduction to their mystic circle.
An instructive gathering. The crowd didn’t in-
clude a single believer in one-man-one-vote nor a
solitary supporter of land-taxation, but they all
agreed in thinking that the voice of the (best)
people is the voice of God. It realised the
Staugh tonic conception of what a Liberal party
ought to be, and The Bulletin herewith chal-
lenges the Victorian Labor members to organise
anything like it.
Whatever precautions may be taken to
prevent diseased animals from conversion into
human food, the public has small show of getting
its breakfast sausage free from germs so long as
butchers pursue their present practice of buying
their wrapping-paper from all and sundry. The
writer recently saw a beef-retailer hand sixpence
to a small girl in return for a considerable bundle
of old newspapers, some of which had the muddy
marks of hob-nailed boots upon them. The man
of meat made no inquiry, and took the dirty foot-
prints as a matter of course. It suggests a sub-
ject for a poem : “Footprints on the Meat.”

Again the hapless Boulia (Q.) climate.
The winter just passed was exceptionally bitter,
and now —seven days in succession the ther-
mometer rises to about 110' in the shade. Also,
some of the local stations have had no rain for two
years, and the chief Chinaman hung himself lately
in despair.

Man caught coming out of a Sydney pub.,
on a Sunday, with a bottle of whisky
sticking out of his pocket, and accusing
constable swore it wasn’t there when he
went in: “Yer Worship, the bottle was
left over at the stables, across the road,
the night before, for me, and I forgot to
take it home. I came for it on the Sun-
day morning, and then went over to the
pub. to see a sick horse.”!!! Beak
Isaacs said it was the most extraordinary
thing he had ever heard that “a man
like Brown should forget a bottle of
whisky on Saturday night, remember it
on Sunday morning, get it first, and go
straight over to the pub. with it —in his
pocket.” But the lawyer was “great,”
and the witnesses were many, and
“down went M‘Ginty ” in the person of
the constable. Verdict for the sick horse.
The Adelaide hospital trouble attained its
second birthday recently and is still going strong.
The latest contribution to the tale of woe is a
pamphlet by Professor Watson, in which he de-
nounces the alleged ignorance and clumsiness of
the new doctors. Said pamphlet is brightened
and lit up and illuminated, so to speak, with
raw-meat pictures of operations said to have
been performed by the new staff. To some out-
siders these sketches are merely slabs of rather
awkward-looking flesh mostly upside-down, but
the writer seems to imply that they are serious
evidence against the present management, and he
whoops accordingly. Meanwhile, the public, among
whom the dreadful thing has been extensively cir-
culated, is inclined to kick. When a medico, in pur-
suance of his own private grudge, spreads this sort of

document all over the city, and any man is liable to
come home at night and find the fire out and the
baby black in the face and his wife in hysterics
because she has been scared by the sudden arrival
of a tract containing sketches of “ innards,” it
seems to be carrying the thing a little too far.

The Adelaide hospital row has burst up
the Adelaide medical school, and turned it into a
mere nursery appendage to Melbourne Univer-
sity. For the future, the Adelaide school will
only teach the first two years’ work of the Mel-
bourne course, and then export its budding Galens
to the Victorian school.

If a teacher of cycling can give evidence in
a Melb. court without having to divulge his pre-

allow to, say, a professor of the banjo or concer-
tina ? He, probably, would be permitted to
whisper his narrative from behind a screen. Or
impart it downwards through a funnel from a hole
in the roof.

Another strange instance of predatory
somnambulism is recorded ; this time from Queens-

outcome of hypnotic suggestion or not isn’t yet

The Glenbrook (N.S.W.) murderer, who-
ever he might be, seems to have had ideas on the
matter of economy. At least, the theory is that
he made his victims dig their own graves, the
deceased-that-was-to-be pegging away under the
impression that it was a shaft, not. a tomb, and
that he was looking for gold. Then, when the
hole was deep enough, there was a bang and a
corpse and the thing was done. There was no
weary grave-digging afterwards with the un-
pleasant deceased fixing the digger with his glassy
eye all the while; no heat and worry and perspira-
tion ; no hunting for new spots when the grave
bottomed on hopeless rock before it got a foot
down, no haulage of the remains. The deceased
simply dropped into the place he had prepared for
DREAMS.

And the dream-scape rosy seems,

Thank the Lord they are but dreams.

Since the discovery of the two bodies at
Glenbrook, it would seem, from the statement of
the oldest inhabitant (as set forth in the evening
papers), that Butler has lately been seen in almost
every part of Australia, and that, in each case, he
was along with a mate who has since gone a-miss-
ing. Every man who hasn’t been seen lately is
now understood to have been buried by Butler,
and there is a general desire to dig up all N.S. W.
in search of the victim. In most cases the oldest
inhabitant recognised Butler by his portrait in the
Telesraph, which made him look just a shade
less villainous than the delegates to the Bathurst
Convention. Meanwhile, if anybody at all
resembling him is arrested and brought to Sydney,
he will have a bad time, for the 1827 people who
were nearly going out prospecting with Butler, or
any other stranger, are excited enough to swear to
anybody, and everybody that anybody has nearly
gone prospecting with anywhere in Australia at
any time in the last three years or more, is Butler
just now, to all intents and purposes.

These graves in the Blue Mountains empha-
sise the fact that the great stumbling-block toinart-
istic homicide is the body. What is urgently needed
by the murdering fraternity is a handy chemical
compound which will reduce the human frame to
a pound or two of dust and reject the three-fourths
of water which helps to compose the bodily avoir-
dupois. When this is accomplished, it will only
be necessary to pour the latter down the sink, and
the dust can bo jammed into a tin, and shied over
the fence as one goes to the picnic.

Where the tragedy is there the wild-eyed,
long-haired, long-nailed man with the rapt ex-
pression and the book under his arm is gathered
together. The Glenbrook mystery was hardly
two days old before prophetic-looking individuals
began to haunt the detective office and shako an
impressive claw in the air, and offer to go into
a trance and reveal everything. There was a
reward of .£lOO awaiting the person who located
Lee Weller’s remains, and the seer witli the far-
away expression in his eye had only to dis-
cover .him and earn the money, but this
simple expedient never occurred to the
tribe. They preferred to argue the matter
with unsympathetic policemen, and try to
get hot, cross, aggravated sergeants to listen while
they told about the trance they intended going
into, and the things they meant to see when they
got into it, and the body they proposed to find in
the gully that they were going to locate, provided
someone would only listen to them. There are
twenty or thirty infallible advertising prophets in
Sydney alone, and not one of them seems to have
done anything towards earning that .£lOO re-
ward and the big advt. that would have gone
along with it. Trie prophets are a dreamy, un-
business-like crowd.

Tasmania has but
one village - settlement
experiment, started a
couple of years since by
a committee of ladies
with Parliamentary in-
fluence. By various de-
vices—one being a “bird”
ball, for which birds were
slaughtered and stuffed
to decorate the costumes
of the promoters —the
ladies have raised £4OO
from the general public.
Parliament has planked
down in all =£Boo. Legis-
lative Councillors profess
to deprecate the “spoon-
feeding ” of the five or
six families comprising
the’Settlement, but agreed
to the latest grant of
.£2OO, because the bene-
volent ladies aforesaid
assured them that their
bantling was “ such a
little one.” The settle-
ment is stuck on the
bleakest, barrenest, most
God-forsaken spot in the
country, and is generally
admitted, in and out of
Parliament, as being
utterly incapable of pro-
ducing a crop of anything
barring bricks or suicides.
Failure being therefore
assured, Fatman displays
commendable readiness
in the matter of Parlia-
mentary assistance.
Meanwhile, thousands of
acres of magnificent agri-
cultural land are kept
locked up pending the

A few years ago a party of miners, some
miles from Maryborough (Vic.), made a hair-
raising discovery. They were sinking in what
they thought was virgin ground when they broke
into an old drive —or rather the bottom of their
shaft dropped out, and they fell into it with a
sudden bump and curse. When they gathered
themselves up and looked round they found they
had company there—seven or eight dead men,
mostly bones. One theory is that their shaft fell
in on them an age or two back, and they weren’t
missed. Another is that an adjacent old-time
shanty-keeper hocussed them to death, robbed
them, buried them and then filled up the shaft,
and they weren’t missed. Either way they were
not missed, for there was no record of their disap-
pearance. After all, when 3i million people

Varley’s Searchlight is reported to be
dead or dying. It was a desperately pious little
paper, which saw incurable wickedness in every-
body except Varley and his little crowd of saints,
and its whole story was that everybody was Lost.
When the public ascertained, on reading the first
number, that everybody was Lost, interest waned.
Nobody could be more Lost than he was in the
first issue, and the subject was exhausted, and
Varley’s mission was used up. When a paper
damns everybody in one number, it leaves nothing
to say in the next one, except that everybody is
still keeping that way.
A certain Australian Judge, who is rapidly
getting himself disliked, recently opened the
criminal-court at a country town where he was
informed there were no prisoners to be tried,
“ This,” remarked his Honor, “ either proves that
the district possesses an unusually high moral stan-
dard, or else there is nothing in it worth stealing,
or else the police are not active enough to catch
the criminals.” Then the local inspector turned
dark purple with indignation and rose to remon-
strate, but while he was doing a preliminary choke
or two his Honor had departed.

ache cure and love-potions, the discovery of lost
property, and several other methods of gathering
in their daily crust. Yet they are a singularly
seedy-looking couple.

A Prahran (Vic.) widow of 50, who an-
nexed one of Tattersall’s smaller sweeps and did
not keep the fact to herself, received three offers
of marriage within the fortnight following the
Cup, two being by letter from utter strangers, who
described themselves as “ possessing a little means,
of loving disposition, and generally considered
handsome.” The wily widow wasn’t taking any.
The handsome snake with a loving disposition
generally elopes with the servant-girl.

Illegal burials are a valuable source of
revenue in some Sydney suburban municipalities.
Certain of them have graveyards which have been
officially closed because they are already over-
crowded with dead, and because the germ-infested
cemetery, in thickly-peopled localities, is a, serious
danger to the living. The fine for burial in a
closed cemetery is £ 5, which money goes to the
municipality, and sometimes the revejrue from
this source runs as high as =£2oo a-year. No local
official attempts to prevent burials in a closed
cemetery; the funeral may be conducted as
publicly as you like, and as often. Then, when it
is all over, the authorities hold out a significant
hand for the £5, and hope that you will come along
and plant some more relatives there shortly.

Of t\St/n(J An
“PAIR GIRLS AND GRAY HORSES.”
(A TOAST.)
To all fair girls ! For the sake of one
Whose bright blue eyes wore awhile my star,
Whoso hair had the rich red gold of the sun
When his kisses fall where the leaf lips are.
To all fair girls ! How the red wine gleams
To the glass’s rim as it gleamed that night
In the jewelled hand of my Dame of Dreams—
Oh ! jewelled fingers so soft and white !
To all fair girls ! Turn your glasses down,
Here’s “Blissful bridals and long to live ! ”
And if I am slighting your eyes of brown,
Oh, gipsies born of the night, forgive !
To all gray horses! Fill up again
For the sake of a gray horse dear to me,
For a foam-fed bit and a snatching rein
And a reaching galloper fast and free.
To all gray horses ! For one steed’s sake
Who has carried me many a journey tall
In the dawn mists dim when the magpies wake,
In the starry haze when the night-dews fall.
To all gray horses ! Now drink you deep,
For red wine ruins no rider’s nerves :
“ Light work and a long, long after-sleep! ”
As each gray horse in the world deserves.
Fair girls and gray horses ! To each his way,
But golden and gray are the loves to hold;
And if gold tresses must turn to gray
Gray horses need never be turned into gold !

Russia, China, Turkey, Italy, &c., are not Federations. They
are still more grossly corrupt. Therefore, want of Federa-
tion causes corruption. You say, “Federation is an ex-
cuse for borrowing some more millions.” Well, aren’t we
borrowing some more millions all the time whether we
are federated or not? J. HTlveen (Sydney) : Nearly

field, none could stand a shower of liquid fire.” Glad to
meet you, brother. We also are discoverers of a new' mode
of destroying rabbits by dropping patent tombstones on

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, Dec. 15, 1896.
Mr Dear Myee—
The Austral Wheel Race Meeting on the Melb.
Cricket Ground attracted more women this year
than ever, and as a dress-show it is rivalling
Flemington. Most of the frocks, however, wasted
themselves on the desert air, or words to that
effect, for the wearers sat perched and jammed in
the grand-stand all the afternoon, and didn’t have
a chance to promenade. On the final day the
lady-enthusiasts filled the members’ reserve and
the “cow-shed,” and spread themselves all over
the surrounding landscape to such an extent that
they had to he politely “ moved on ” from the
smoking-stand. Every man, woman, and child in
the little village down South is cycling mad ; the
race-winners are heroes, and the woman who
boasts that she knows C. Kellow to nod to is
gazed at with respectful awe. Among the well-
dressed thousands on the stand on the “ Austral ”
day was a little actress in a dress like a wax
matchbox —all stripes and plaids—the betrothed of
a well-known professional cyclist.
It is ordained in the Book of Fate that bicycle
sports are always held in a raging wind, worrying
all the women’s fringes out of curl, giving their
hats a drunken list to leeward, and generally
taking the starch out of their appearance. Except
for that drawback, Sydney Bicycle Club’s races on
Saturday were bright and festive. The new stand
entered unobtrusively into existence without any
formal opening, although there was a general im-
pression that somebody ought to have risen to the
occasion with speeches and champagne. Lady
members should be grateful for the new structure ;
it is an artistic two-storeyed pavilion of red brick,
with stone staircase, leading to a green lawn in
front. Members, on Saturday, seemed to be too
bashful to be the first to tread the grass, and it
was deserted. There are large afternoon-tea-rooms,
with grass frontages, placed at the back of the
stand on both floors, so that one can have a cup of
tea without being huddled into a cellar, as in the
old-style refreshment-room. Staircases to the top-
floor are breezy; on Saturday, those ascending
and descending performed an involuntary serpen-
tine dance with their skirts, and felt glad if they
had coppers or reconstructed deposit-receipts in
their pockets to act as sinkers.
Saturday at Sydney Lyceum saw the first night
of Zola’s Therese ” ; the management evidently
counted on the naughty author as a draw, for his
name was printed on the programmes in large
capitals. It was a ghastly, creepy, crawly per-
formance, the sort of play that makes you feel as
if there were a mouse running about the floor, an
extra-sized tarantula taking his hairy way down
the wall, and a beetle clawing the back of your
neck. The plot is flavored with Hamlet. Kyrle
B. and Mrs. Potter plan to murder Mrs. P.’s
husband, and subsequently marry like Gertrude
and Claudius. Mrs. Hill, as mother-in-law,
doubles the parts of Hamlet and the Ghost; as a
galvanised corpse in a bath-chair who has been
paralysed on suddenly learning her daughter-in-
law’s guilt, she has a rdle horrible enough to be
stuck in an Amurkan burlesque and labelled
funny.” The situations are “real”; so is Kyrle’s
remorse, which is obviously heightened by a tear-
ful regret that he didn’t “do for” the whole cast
while he was about the job.
Mrs. Potter was weirdly Potteresque about the
hair, which was twisted into twin nobs on the nape
of her neck. There was no Worth in the bill.
Ther&se wore only one pretty frock—blue muslin
with an iip-to-date fichu and long sash-ends of
black chiffon—and that she took off in view of the
audience ; her dessous were white (I am glad to
hide my blushes behind a little French in recalling
the frank revelations of act 3). When Laurent
also proceeded to disrobe, an interested audience
noted with concern that he wasn’t wearing any—
I’ve forgotten the French for “ braces,” so I can’t
describe any more. Going out, I heard a man
wish he could turn a garden-hose on the whole
show.
Two conspicuous weddings occurred in Sydney
on the 9th. Miss Gaden’s marriage with Mr. j.
Thompson Brown enveloped St. John’s, Darling-
hurst,%m a high-scented atmosphere of flowers and
perfumery, and a rustling whirl of satin, lace, and
feathers. The knot was tied in a bower of foliage
and lilies, in which the clergyman smiled blandly
like a jack-in-the-green. The bridegroom is im-
ported from Scotland, and is taking his bride fora
tour around Australia in the congenial mosquito
season before settling down.
Wedding No. 2 was more uncommon, being a
Jewish ceremony, which implies standing under a
gorgeous velvet canopy like a four-poster, held aloft
by four supporters, smashing a wine-glass, and
being united to a man with his hat on. Miss Rosa
Gotthelf was married to Mr. E. Hallenstein at the
Grand Synagogue, all Potts Point being assembled
as lookers-on.
A suburban church essayed to raise some neces-
sary coin last week by a concert which worked out
on highly original lines. Tableaux—strictly proper
groups, of course—-of a semi-religious nature were
arranged, and suitable music was to be played
while the pictures were showing. But they turned
on a worldly young man at the piano, and the
reverend showman looked pained when for appro-
priate tunes to the first “ tablow,” “ Faith, Hope,,
and Charity,” the performer hammered out, “I
believe it, for my mother told me so,” and “ Could
X only back a winner,” and ‘‘Please give me a
P™ny. ” Then the limelight fell on “ The Horrors,
of War After the Battle,” and the secular person
out “ More work for the undertaker.” All
the “tablow” were accompanied in the same
flippant strain, but the promoter of the entertain-
ment felt his hair rise at two girls, sisters of a
legal luminary, who did a turn —and a very clever
turn, too—imitating street-singing boys clad in
ragged shirts and pants, and with bare feet realis-
tically dirt-smudged. Next time that Bethel
makes a raid it will probably fall back on the
orthodox Berlin woolwork scramble or “cake
fair. ”
Colored dinners are now the Nicest form of
hospitality. A “ pink ” bean-feast means candle-
shades, flowers, and silk fixings all of rosy hue, with
lots of cochineal in the cookery. The vermilion
insect is innocuous, so anything in that tint is all
right. “Yellow” repasts are shaded in saffron,
also harmless, though physicky to taste. But a
“ green ” banquet must make the guests think
hard and run over in their minds all the dyes cal-
culated to give a verdant hue, from angelica to
arsenic. Green soup may owe its tone to spinach,
but green chops and steaks only suggest decom-
position. And fancy the effect of green lamp-
shades on the complexion ! As tertiary tints and
minor tones are now fashionable, wan, seasick-
looking revellers may be next invited to feast on a
color scheme of verdigris, sulphur-yellow, or hell-
blue.
Badge-wearing is spreading to the S. Pacific.
The lady-principal of a girls’ school in Apia,
Samoa, opened a few years ago by M. E. Jersey,
is visiting Australia and giving facts about the
spread of the good work among the dusky belles.
The poor girls are now deprived of their cigarettes
and asked to join an “ anti-smoking league,”
signifying the same by wearing a white ribbon
badge. The school-marm doesn’t explain how
the badge is fixed on ; perhaps they stick it to
their chests with glue. A Samoan girl looks so
pretty reclining on her mat and smoking her little
bit of twisted tobacco leaf. But the principal,
bred in the soul-stifling atmosphere of middle-
class provincial England, decrees smoking a deadly
sin, and forbids it along with the dances and all
the other island frivolities.
Veils are now being “downed” by some doc-
tors who claim to have discovered death-dealing
germs in the few inches of net that look so fragile
and are rather warmer on the face than flannel.
If a man wants to find out what discomfort a
woman will suffer for the sake of keeping her hair
tidy, let him tie a bit of gossamer round his face
and wear it down town on a hot day. Veils are
one of the small tortures of life. They want so
much fixing. I know a girl who always gives her-
self an hour to put her veil right, and then some-
times the spots get wrong and a large black dab
on the eye makes her look as if she had been in a
street fight, or a patch in front of her smile blackens
a front tooth.
The newly-announced Govt. House engagement
of Captain Ferguson to the Hon Margaret Brand
makes his Ex. father-in-law elect to -£ 14,000 per
an. Moral for a Governor with marriageable
daughters : Always have opulent aides.
From Kalgoorlie I hear of an energetic woman
who successfully can vassed for the recent Mayoral
election in a highly novel way. H. G. Parsons,
the winning candidate, employed a hugely fat
black-gin dressed in bloomers of sacking canvas,
bright green blouse, yellow sash, and vast hat with
scarlet feathers, to travel through the town on a
bicycle distributing handbills.
A recent Westralian bridal was blighted owing
to the temporary disappearance of the groom. He
had a “ touch of the sun,” and in his delirium
wandered far afield, so that it took him some days
to find his way back home. His bride had taken
his defection pliilosophically, and economically sold
the wedding shew-bread to glorify another bridal
feast. When the lost one turned up there was no
time to purchase another frosted mound ; and,
besides, it was felt that the groom might have an-
other vanishing attack, and it was hardly worth
while to stake much expensive cake on so unreli-
able a performer. So they celebrated the wedding
with a shilling “Canterbury.”
There is nothing so hideous as a mode too old-
fashioned to be smart and too new to be antique,
so, although the action of “Called Back,” played
by the Rignold co., at the Royal, is dated in the
sixties, the ladies of the cast wisely drape them-
selves to date. Emily Hughes, as Pauline, has
two fashionable frocks—the first, a practicable-
looking white silk crepon, with yellow stripes,
prettily fixed up with flimsy chiffon, and white
hat (a garden-party effect); the other is a pink
satin evening-gown. In her mad moments, she is
■clad in regulation-white flowing draperies; a
stage-heroine never disgraces her “store-clothes”
by lunacy, but always keeps a special gown for
going mad in. Mary Vaughan (Miss Watts-
Phillips) has many changes of raiment; her
prettiest is a pale-blue brocade, with a guinea-a-
yard effect. Rignold, as the oily Macari, has a
picturesque brigandish cloak and a musical Italian
■cadence in his voice, and the Siberian exiles shrink
from the knout and grovel naturally—in their
■dirty old coats they look nearly as ragged as
Domain-loafers, and much cooler. On Monday
night, a budding Lawton in the gallery contri-
buted a gratis whistling-accompaniment to the
■orchestra, which was much appreciated by the
■other gods.
Three newly-wedded couples, whose new-found
bliss doesn’t date back further than last week, all
ran up against each other, much to their mutual
■embarrassment, at the same honeymoon resort a
■day or two ago. All had elaborately announced
per society pars, their departure on a large and
dignified tour, and when they collided about a
half-crown train-ride from the city the situation
was really painful.
The prophesied rise in the matrimonial market
is still booming. This week’s flutter was the
wedding of Miss Pearl Lamb and Mr. Wm. Allen
at St. Mark’s. Points about this ceremony differ-
entiating it from others were no bridesmaids and
many gifts from Govt. House, including some
vice-regal upholstery, millinery and jewelleiy.
Shops are full of Xmas novelties. Many are
the same old novelties, but some are really new.
People give queer presents. I think it’s rather a
broad hint to present a friend with nail-cleaning
apparatus. Yet “ manicure ” sets are popular as
gifts, and more and more elaborate each festive
season ; one is continually meeting elegant little
silver trays containing polisher of “shammy,”
silver box of powder, curly nail-scissors, and
other implements the use of which is
“shrouded in mystery” to plain folk, ac-
customed to do the business with a threepenny
nail-brush and a cake of brown Windsor.
A hint to fan-purchasers: fans are dwindling
to the tiny size affected by our grandmothers ; at
’Ome fashionables now flutter diminutive makes,
much bespangled. A snake-skin leather belt is
now considered a toney gift. If any young man
wishes to delight his best girl with an offering of
gloves, they should be of white kid with black
stitchings.
A ghoulish yarn from Bananaland. Townsman
died and undertaker was called in. Sorrowing
family ordered an expensive oaken, silver-plated
coffin. Subsequent to funeral bereaved widow
called on undertaker and explained that deceased
hadn’t left enough to pay for his interment. So
the coffin-seller arose by night and went to the
cemetery with two of his men, and exhumed the
body, casting it back into the grave minus the
shell, which he took home with him. This is not
an encore verse for “ More Work for the Under-
taker,” although it reads like one.
On a large passenger-boat, a few days out, a
confused man wandered at dusk into the wrong
cabin, and was bewildered to hear a faint voice
from the upper berth say “ I’m so glad you’ve
come. You’re later than usual this evening,
aren’t you ? ” He stammered something, and a
sea-sick old fright popped up her head, gave a
shrill scream, and fainted with horror at seeing a
man in her cabin. Next day the trespasser apolo-
gised for everything he hadn’t done, and the old
maid explained that she was so nervous that a
steward came in every evening to screw down the
dead-light for her. “ But why scream at me more
than at him?” the man asked after thinking hard
for a few moments. “Oh, it’s quite different,”
replied the old lady, tossing her head snortfully,
“ don’t you see, he’s only the steward.”
When Nice Australians die they go to South
Kensington. They may not be actually corpsed
when they go there, but, as J. C. Neild bitterly
remarks, they might as well be dead for all the
notice they attract. The nooent waterspout of
oblivion overwhelms them. So in order to feel
less blotted out they make up parties of their
fellow-cliquers on the mail-boat, and put on
their best clothes to go to the Imperial In-
stitute, where they sit in the gardens with a
far-off gaze, not having yet got the ocean out of
their eyes. They look exactly like the people
you’d avoid on the deck of a liner; and they say
“Oh, how pretty ! ” when the colored lights are
switched on, and stroll into the galleries of the
unuseful pile of buildings, and note with royal
thrills murky shadows alleged to be photos.. of
royalties on china labelled “Specimens of photo-
ceramics, taken by H.R.H. the Princess of
Wales,” and observe dusty trophies of “ big game
shot in South Africa by Lord Toodles ” ; and the
lady-reporter from the Antipodes prowls around
and puts them all into the British Australasian
as “ prominent Australians,” along with ex-
colonial bishops, governors, and other magnates.
And that pleases them mightily. But the view
of things antipodean exchanged by bishopesses,
governoresses, and so on when they foregather in
a South Kensington boudoir, no one knoweth.
Writes my Melb. correspondent:—
“ Coolgardie brides, who have only experienced
winter-time over there, have hitherto written
home to Victoria that the climate was ‘heavenly.’
Now they are in the first swelter of summer, and
their letters are less pleasant reading, what with
the costliness of laundry-work, the plague of field-
mice, blue-bottle flies, and, worst of all, the willy-
willies.
“ A girl who arrived there to be married saw
her first sand-storm during the marriage cere-
mony. The building filled with red dust; the
bridegroom and best man rushed to close the doors
and windows, and the parson changed the strain
of his prayers to a frantic petition for the safety of
the roof of his new church. The bride was
inclined to talk of ill omens until they cheered her
up with the news that it was quite ordinary W. A.
weather. Her forebodings returned in full force
when she came out of church, and saw that, of her
neat home, which had been finished all but the
windows, only the stumps remained.
“ The latest fad of Vic. Govt. House ladies is
swimming, and they go in for this amusement
with vigour in the early morn at Kenny’s Baths,
where a couple of bathing-boxes are set apart for
them. Lady B. arrays herself in a vivid scarlet
serge bathing-dress elaborated with white braid,
but a breathless public learns that Mrs. Freeman-
Thomas depends on the bathing-house proprietors
for her suit, and encases herself in the unlovely
blue serge garment in which countless others have
probably disported themselves. His Ex., as sas-
siety is interested to hear, gravely mops up his
ample vice-regal person with the towels served out
by the establishment and struggles into his vest-
ments entirely unaided.
“ The snappiest cycle girl in Melb. is a fair un-
known who wears an exquisite white cloth habit
with silver buttons and white cap, and who
carries, even against fearful odds, a white moire
parasol. The way she manages to steer her course
through the city traffic with one hand, bearing
aloft her shade with the other, her fair face be-
wreathed in smiles, baffles mere prose description
and turns all other cycle girls jaundiced with
jealousy.
“On Wednesday evening last, at the St. Kilda
Town Hall, the Societa Dante ruthlessly under-
took to present an emaciated version of “ II Bar-
biere di Siviglia,’ which by interpretation meaneth
our oM friend the Seville barber, he of the velvet
smalls and light tenor voice. Three Rebottaros,
' f, and Sig. Buzzi were in the
cast, and their Ex.’s and half Melb. society in the
audience. An over-anxious orchestra mistook
.Baronet Clarke s party for the vice-regal ones and
eni?>h U f ed ‘ n he i o udlence with a fanfare and an
emphatic ‘ God Save. ’ When the only folk legally
qualified to be God-saved did arrive the musicians,
staggered by their previous misadventure, hailed
them with a very still, small volume of sound and
without any fanfare whatever. His Ex. took the
whole performance very somnolently and in a
heavy and resigned spirit. His Ex., however,
takes most things in a rather massive spirit.
<l The, last performance of the ‘Stars of All
-Nations took place on Saturday night. The
dressing of this company is something to be
lemembered. The ‘ Winterton Sisters ’ change
twice in their short turn, wearing lovely pale
blue, accordion-pleated silk skirts and poppies
on their first appearance, and pale grey and pink
roses in their mandoline dance. There is a shy
modest manner about these two sisters which is
very taking, in contrast with the quarter-inch-
boiler-plate ‘ cheek ’ of the every-dav music-hall
young person Miss Lottie Moore, in her sketch,
iVlistaken Identity,’ looks good enough to eat.
Her costume is a lovely wallpapery-green bro-
cade silk skirt, piped with yellow, a bodice of violet
velvet with diamond ornaments, aglittering girdle
of the same jewels, underskirt of black silk and yel-
low flounces, green satin shoes and green silk stock-
ings, which show to great advantage in her flip-
flap at the end. Miss Clotilde Antonio doesn’t
wear much, but her lavender silk tights and frilly
b reneh-lace trunks are also refreshing. Miss
Winifred Johnson is a dazzling person in pale-blue
silk blouse crossbarred with black velvet, and
dark-blue velvet skirt. The gentlemen of the com-
pany are rather less gorgeous, except Mr. Lee in
the uniforms of the various monarchs of the ‘effete
civilisations ’of the Old World. Taking them all
round, however, in the matter of clothes they are
a stupendous organisation.
A Tasmanian correspondent writes :
“Launceston went in for a dizzy cycle fete
lately. It passed off very well. The scene
was the little square, somewhere about the
average size of a boomster’s garden at Toorak—
the little square with its lawns and fountain, and
with the tiger and bear scraping themselves
against the iron bars of their shabby domains,
where hundreds of white rats and black rats
scramble in and out of their weatherboard villa.
In this time-honored, unimproved dot of a public
garden some 2000 people contrived to congregate
(at great danger to life and limb owing to numerous
reckless cyclists and cyclistes) and had a real good
time as good times go in Tasmania. The only
accidents comprised a Chinaman knocked down
by a bike and a lady’s eye blackened by the
cork of an exploding hop-beer bottle. We are not
a murderous crowd in Tasmania.
Yours affectionately,
CLEO.
The Bulletin’s Xmas number this year
was the largest and best yet issued, and it also
put up the largest circulation record to date.
For several years past the supply has given out on
the morning of publication. This time, by very
largely increasing the supply, a special effort has
been made to satisfy all demands. A very few
copies are still available.
The coming Tasmanian elections will, if
the local pious party can manage it, turn largely
on the question of Tattersall’s sweeps. The good
men of Vandemonia hold that Tattersall’s inno-
cent little gamble is brother to Sodom and Gom-
morrah, and they will ask the electors to cast out
Adams before he brings the divine wrath down on
their little insular fly-speck.
Arthur Streeton’s exhibition of paintings
in Melbourne threatens to excite a rush of Sydney
artists with goods for sale. The local gallery
trustees have secured “The Purple Moon’s Trans-
parent Light ” for =£lso, little Dr. Springthorpe
invested .£5O in “On the River” (what wouldn’t
he give for a soulful treatment of “On the Bike”!)
and other Streeton pictures have found purchasers.
The collection, which numbers about forty charac-
teristic specimens of the visitor’s charming work,
is exhibited at 88 Elizabeth-street.
A considerable circle of friends lament the
loss of Benjamin Dennison, actuary and secretary
to the Mutual Life of New York in Australia.
Mr. Dennison was a man of rare ability, without
a trace of assumption, and one of the best of good
fellows to those who knew and appreciated his
worth. He was a pupil of Ralph Price Hardy,
the distinguished actuary, and came to Australia
some fifteen years ago in the service of the Colonial
Mutual. Soon after Major Rennie established
the Australian department of his company Mr.
Dennison joined his staff, where he remained
until his death. He had long suffered from lung
disease, and passed away peacefully early Sunday
morning.
How is the Bulli Colliery Fund getting on ?
When last heard of, there were some .£30,000 to
credit, and probable claims worth, perhaps,
.£5OOO, leaving a prospective balance of possibly
=625,000, and a tidy billet for somebody to mind
it. What’s the matter with erecting the Bulli
colliery balance, after probable claims have been
actuarially provided for, into a National Mining
Relief Fund, and helping the day-to-day sufferers,
like those at Stockton? Your average trustee
seems so anxious to do business on the best mathe-
matical principles, and to keep his office, and his
secretary, and his office - expenses afloat as
long as possible, that those for whom the
public subscribed the money, those who should be
the recipients of charity on the instant, when they
want it, are killed off, or learn to provide for
themselves, before the Board has done enquiring
into their cases. Public money for charitable re-
lief is subscribed to be spent, not to be kept on
hand and put out at interest, and the sooner the
average trustee gets this into his head the better.

ENO A BLESSING IN EVERY HOUSE.
—Eno’s “Fruit Salt.” —A lady writes
thing, medicine or food, ceased to act properly foi
at least three months before I commenced taking
it; the little food I could take generally punished
me or returned. My life was one of great suffer-
ing, so that I must have succumbed before long.
To me and our family it has been a great earthly
blessing.” Sold by all chemists and stores. *

upon Westralia and fiercely whale the six
families.
A Melb. brass-plate :
A. PATTERSON,
Teacher of Baxjo.
Louis Becke’s latest photo, from London
reweals that once gaunt and piratical-looking
genius as a prosperous-looking personage with a
tendency towards a double chin.
Professor William Miller, 50 years old on
Dec. 13, is one of the very few athletes who meet
their jubilee trim of figure, virile and vigorous.
Most of them by that time are pot-shaped, and
beer-bloated, and bung generally.
J.P. : “ Vhat vhas you plead? Troonk
aber not troonk ! Dot vhas do say, kildy aber
notkildy?” Accused: “Guilty.” J.P. : “ Vined
abound, aber der rising ov der goord.” For of
such is the kingdom of political jaypeedom in
N.S.W.
N.S.W. Labor Bureau boss Joseph Creer
merely smiles at the numerous press attacks on
his capacity. But he is driven to the verge of in-
sanity, when inspecting relief-works, by his con-
stituents’habit of whistling “Pretty Joey” till
the locality seems a cockatoo training-school.
Lawyer Geake, the absconding embezzler
who was landed back at Smellbourne last week, is
said to have been guilty of most exemplary conduct
on his return journey. Geake was a whale for divine
service, and, under police supervision, he led pas-
sengers and crew in prayer and thanksgiving.
Poor Lee Weller, on his last birthday,
wrote his autograph in a friend’s birthday-book in
front of the verse : “ We walk by faith, not by
sight.” Then he seems to have walked by faith
after his mate into the gully at Glenbrook, and by
not keeping that energetic prospector in sight he
was dropped with a gun from behind.
Melb.: “A life-size statue, badly muti-
lated or dilapidated, apparently of the public-
spirited and benevolent Ormond, adorns the yard
of a firm of gravestone choppers, and seems to
have been taken down froin somewhere. May I
suggest that it could profitably be traded off on
some English provincial town as the Prince of
Wales?”
Victoria’s prize fat woman —she weighed
24 stone —died peacefully a little while ago at
Dunolly, aged GG. The local paper proudly men-
tions that the upper part of her arm was a yard in
circumference. The illness of this substantial
lady commenced with a sudden fainting-fit, and
eleven friends with difficulty got her to bed, which
she never again quitted.
Deakin has a marvellous memory for
figures. His three hours and 20 minutes’ speech
on the Water Commission’s report —in all, accord-
ing to the Hansakd calculation, he spoke 28,200
words —was delivered from only a few scrappy
notes, roughly prepared. It was full of figures,
but he seemed to carry them nearly all in his head.
He smashed up the Water Commission, and did it
easily, though, as that body consisted of the most
mildewed and muddle-headed set of duffers that
could have been picked from the Assembly, the
feat was comparatively easy for Deakin.
GAINING EXPERIENCE.
NEW ARRIVAL : “ In this countwy, whcah sheep are bwed for the fleece, would it not be
more pwofitable to allow the tails to gwow?”
OLD STAGER : “ Well, sonny, you see the droughts out here in this bloomin' country drive
the jumbucks to desperation with the cussed thirst, and if we didn't cut the tails
of they'd bite ’em in the dry weather and bleed to death."
Matthew “Mercantile” Davies is said to
have been the hidden wire-puller who conceived
and engineered the translation of Vic. barristers
and Vic. attorneys into amalgams. Attorneys
were barred from the Supreme Court bench, the
only gate thereto being the Bar. Matthew’s
ambition was a judgeship, therefore the amalga-
mation. Had not the boom burst when it did,
Matthew would now likely have been sitting in
the seat of Johnnie Madden, and he may get there
yet, thanks to gall and pertinacity.
The latest move to restore confidence in
the hapless Q.N.B. isthe appointment of Norman to
the Agent-Generalship. That popular old warrior
possesses some 63 shares (uncalled capital, .£126)
in the Q.N.8., and it is openly averred in the
Bananaland journals that the spectacle of the
ex-Govemor with his 63 shares tied round his
neck, lecturing Bull on the glories of Bananaland,
will inspire a confidence, etc., etc., etc.
The curse of Butler ! Butler No. 1, the
notorious alleged murderer from Maoriland, was
recently awarded a long sentence in Melbourne.
Butler No. 2 was the Sydney divorce-case male-
factor. Butler No. 3 is badly wanted over the
Glenbrook (N.S.W.) murders. Yet the Sydney
and Mel*>. Directories only show one column of
Butlers against three solid pages of Smith, and it
is only once in a decade that any great criminal is
named Smith.
Westralia’s ex-
Govemor, Napier
Broome, who has
died at 54, always
looked on himself
as a badly-treated
man. Even as a
schoolboy, he
thought himself
badly treated. Yet
he got a fair share
of good turns. His
official appoint-
ments in Mauritius
and Australia were
gifts from unseen
hands. It is said
his wife, who was
the widow of an
army officer, and a
sort of Mrs. Mellon
occult wonder-
worker, engineered
him into official
harness. Promo-
tion was frequently
promised, but he
took every friendly
advance with a bad
grace. He versified
a lot, and sulked
a lot, and growled
about his hard fate
and the miserable
recognition awar-
ded him, and even
a few months ago
abandoned his post
at Trinidad with-
out leave of the
Colonial Office. He
was at one time a
writer on London
Times.
King O’Malley, M.P. (S.A.), the much-
advertised ’Murkan lightning streak insurance
drummer, recently got a verdict' against the wart-
cure man, who threatened to burst him up and
aim him out of Parliament. The S. A. public will
now be very glad to have a prolonged rest from
both parties. A Society for Being Tired of
O’Malley would be a huge success in Adelaide just
now.
A jamful. address by the officers of the
Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society to Leslie
J. Park, on his recent appointment as general
manager, fetched a historic reply from the recipi-
ent. Mr. Park’s burst of thanks closed with a
quotation from Richelieu —“ What was my art —
Genius some say, soma fortune—Witchcraft some
—Not so—my art was justice.” The Bulletin is
glad to think that the genial city gent, in the
modern bell-topper disclaimed all pretensions to
Witchcraft.
VIEW OF FIVE DOCK BY NIGHT.
“Five Dock streets arc still in darkness, except on those nights when a
friendly moon hangs her lamp above. Some time ago, it will be remembered,
the Gas Company, in consequence of heavy arrears of rates, sent some of their
men to the borough and cut off the supply of gas to the public lights. The
aldermen met and considered the position, but could do nothing. The Gas
Company desired payment, and the council had not the necessary funds to
meet the demand. A statement of account was asked for by the council, and
furnished by the Gas Company. Then the Mayor (Alderman J. Croker) and
Aldermen Rodd and Ghest waited upon the company, and a lengthy discus-
sion ensued, but in the absence of payment of the amount the company declined
to restore the supply of gas.”
In the earliest days of Melb., Sam Hordern,
the founder of the Hordern family, ran a cooperage
on the site of the present General Post-Office.
The notorious
Gipsy Smith
(bushranger, &c.)
was arrested on
his arrival in Aus-
tralia in the old
days by that clever
ex-convict, Detec-
tive . The
charge was a seri-
ous one, both men
were armed, and
things looked like
a fight, when Gip-
sy, looking hard
at his captor, said:
“Good Lord,
Jack, is this how
we meet after
twenty years ? It
is a d— — hard
world this.” And
so it was. Both
men had worked
together in Eng-
land and had
“ been sent out ”
for the one job,
and after twenty
years thus they
met. Gipsy got a
long sentence, but
he was true to his
word and never
told what he knew
about his old
friend the detec-
tive.
N. : “ Bis-
marck’s career has
been an unbroken
line of frauds, end-
ing with one last
month. Yet he is the clergy’s idol, because he
says religion inspired him all through.”
Baronet Read, ex-Governor of Darling-
hurst prison, successfully resists all pressure to
return to his ancestral halls, and whiles away his
pensioned leisure within a stone’s throw of his
late official residence. Sir John is a County Clare
baronet, with an early-developed liking for police
duty. He retired from the English police force
with a pension, and secured another pension, of
nearly =6400 a year, from N.S. Wales when he
handed over his charge of the gaol. The baronet’s
son, another N.S.W. pensioner, is also reluctant
to quit Australia, but when the title of tenth
baronet falls to him he is likely to re-gild his crest
and return to his devoted barony.
Poor Clark Irving used to describe ex-
Judge Windeyer’s address to the Sydney I ni-
versity electors at his first contest. The Judge
tramped up and down the platform, stormed,
roared, wept, and generally aroused the feelings
of the electoral undergraduates. “ I heard, said
barrister Irving, “all the noises in nature, from
the barn-yard to the desert.”
The Dean Curse was in full blast the other
day at Cooma. Meagher, who lost his practice
and his seat in Parliament through it, was putting
up at the local hotel, having come to inflict his
dreary lecture on the Cooma population. And
John Asbury, Mrs. Seymour’s long-lost husband,
was putting up the same day at the lock-up oppo-
site on a charge of helpless old age and beggary.
Melb. Undertaker Sleight, who was the
other day undertaken himself, was jovial to the
end. Only a week before he died he met a well-
known solicitor, also passing through the Valley,
and offered to bet a funeral against the drawing
up of a will, that he would last the longest. The
man of law won, and now it dawns on him that
the dead undertaker can’t bury him, so the bet is
irrecoverable.
Poor Jimmy Mirams’ latest gleam of pros-
perity was quickly extinguished. The ex-Premiei
Permanent secretary was hardly started in hi*
Collins-street stationery shop when the Argus
people came down on him with a thud for unpaid
law costs in his abortive libel-suit. Then a line in
the daily papers announced that the little man’s
estate was compulsorily sequestrated, and Mirams
and his umbrella go down once more in the deep
commercial waters.
Hall-Jones, the new M.L. Minister for
Works, was a serious incubus on his party at the
recent election. He is a stodgy, lifeless, conscien-
tious orator, whose speeches are a waste of figure*
droned out in the voice of a wind sighing in a
valley of dry bones. Hall-Jones has a good, hard-
working brain, but when he is put up to charm
the electors, and proceeds to blow dry facts across
the plains of Canterbury, he is a heavy-weight for
any Ministry to carry.
Ex-Mayoress Yates, of Onehunga (M.L.),
has been defeated for the Mayoralty by 133 votes.
Mrs. Yates’ regime was chiefly noted for the long
and determined strike of the poundkeepet and the
inferior quality of the illumination in Onehunga’s
solitary lamp. Moreover, all the louts of Auck-
land and Onehunga used to roll up at council-
meetings to boo-hoo and throw road-metal on the
roof, and this kind of notoriety made Onehunga
grow tired of lady Mayors.
Dr. Balls-Headley, Melbourne s doss
women’s doctor, has been selected to write the
chapter on the causation of the special diseases of
women for the great “English System of Medi-
cine,” now issuing. The doctor, who is chief
surgeon of Melb. Woman’s Hospital, lately pub-
lished a treatise on the evolution of the diseases
of women, which has shaken up the world of
medicine pretty considerably, and badly punctured
many old medical traditions.
Dr. C. J. Martin, who has just resigned
the demonstratorship of physiology at Sydney
University to become lecturer thereon at Melb.

Mr MURRAY SMITH wisbedto say a|
tew words The Government reminded one of thej
baron in Sir Walter Scott’s novel who j
went out m the morning to hunt, and was
joined by two companions, one representing
his good angel and the other his bad angel.
The one urged him to wise courses, and the
other to predatory mischief; and the baron
followed the bad angel until his cup was,
full and his doom was fixed. He would* not;
point out which was the bad angel of the
Ministry, but its good angel might be found!

POINTS
Under the head of “ State- Aided Insol-
vencies ” somebody raises a reasonable question in
the Melb. press. Ought not a civil-servant who,
in the face of a fixed salary, files a schedule which
deserves no sympathy, to be turned out of his
billet to make way for another fellow who won t
systematically bilk the shop-
keepers? Every salaried ser-
vant who pays his way is taxed
to help supply the deficiencies
of those who don’t. That’s
an unavoidable law of retail
trade which the Government
could soften somewhat by
checking insolvency among its
employes.
A HARD CASE.
(Sunday morning in Pitt-street, as Christian
Endeavorer passes on.)
BILLY (log.): “Gumbo, what did him parson
pfeller say?”
CUMBO: “Him say ‘ Cumbo, my brudder, you born
in sin, ’but I say him no fear; Cumbo born
in Mullengudgery. ”
An exchange announces that R. D. Meagher
will oppose Crick in West Macquarie at next
general election.
On the Manuka (M.L.) electoral roll one
woman-voter has registered herself : “ Occupa-
tion : domestic slave.”
A Melb. Tory
The Socialists’ creed is formulated in the shibboleth,
“ each man according to his needs,” whereas in'the main
the present rule is “ each according to his deeds."
In 71 years (1825-1895) there have been
only three when there were no hangings in New
South Wales. The spreading gallows tree is a
busy institution in Botany Bay.
The “ Freetrade League of Victoria ” states
that its total receipts for the last two years have
been .£lO4 9s. lOd. The great Freetrade revival
doesn’t pan out much in solid cash, anyhow.
A candidate for a West Coast (M.L.)
County Council announced that he was in favor
of “ the abolition of the duty on smoked fish, pro-
hibition of blow-flies, free coal to settlers on the
Nine-mile Beach, and a supply of apple dumplings
for stray dogs.”
London Morning Post wonders how
alleged Freetrade Premier Reid can attitudinise
as an anti-Chinese legislator—who, by that atti-
tude, proclaims himself a Protectionist. The Post
doesn’t know what curious two-legged comedians
there are in N.S.W.
They let the Gentleman One down very
easily in Holy Adelaide. The other day “ the
case of , a practitioner,” was called ; ——, a
Cractitioner, having adhered to money that didn’t
elong to him. Ordered to be struck off the rolls
if he didn’t pay up in a given time ; if he does re-
fund the money, will remain a practitioner as
usual.
N.S.W. Premier Reid went on his mission
to Queensland, and, for over a week, the papers
reported how he was steadily eating and drinking
his way over the province in the cause of Federa-
tion. Now an abrupt telegram reports that
Queensland is going to leave things just as they
are. Considering all the good victuals that have
been put into the business, this is by no means
the sort of thing-Australia looked for.
It was alleged the other day, in Sydney
Insolvency Court, that a bankrupt had for six
years occupied a house in Woolloomooloo, rented
at 50s. a week. In 1890, six months after he began
to occupy the property, it was resumed by Govern-
ment for some purpose or other, and as no one
ever demanded the rent thereafter, insolvent natu-
rally didn’t pay any. Apparently, the N.S.W.
Government is a very poor rent-collector.
Ash, law-partner of Premier Kingston, is
the most stubborn antagonist of the S.A. Govt, in
all attempts to ameliorate the condition of the
workers. Recently Kingston spoke of “Ash’s
ingenious objections to everything designed to
benefit humanity,” described him as “ the incarna-
tion of selfishness,” and accused him of “ putting
Private Greed before public good.” Yet the pair
join amicably together to take the fees of clients.
Ash the other day had one poor unfortunate wit-
ness under examination for 10 hours.
According to T. Davis, M.P., there are
240 alleged “ clubs ” in and around Sydney, where
the “ flowing bowl ” flows unrestrained
every Sunday. This writer knows of at least
three clubs on the books of which his name
appears as a “ registered member.” He has
never been in two of them more than once
—in fact, he couldn’t go straightaway to
one of those two—and has been only three
times in the third, which he “joined’’six
months or so ago. He paid no entrance
or other fee, but signed his “registered
membership ” in a book kept for that pur-
pose, after having been duly vouched for as
“straight” by his introducer. The only
drawback to these “clubs,” from a Sunday
“professional ” point of view, is that every
now and again the alleged proprietor gets
harassed by the police, and the “club”
changes its address, so that, unless a de-
sultory “member” keeps in touch with its
befallings, he may one Sunday walk a couple
of miles to where it was, only to discover
that the locality knows it no more. But
why bother about “clubs” when Sunday
drinks can be got in every other hotel in
Sydney ?
Queensland Minister Tozer reports
that up in the gay and drinky North a
Govt, official has been suspended for six
months, for being in a tangled condition
and galloping through the town with a wo-
man’s bonnet on. They are growing par-
ticular about smadl trifles in the North.
There was a time in that riotous land of
snakes when a Govt, official could gallop
through the town with hardly anything on
save his unblemished character, and no one
dreamt of suspending him. The present
writer remembers an occasion when three
perfectly nude Govt, officers—a P.M., a
sub-inspector of police, and a C.P.S. —were
jumping for drinks in the back yard of a
North Queensland pub., at 2 a.m., but that is too
long a story to tell just here.
Now that Duncan Gil-
lies is coming back to Vic-
toria and talks of re-entering
politics, it is worth while re-
minding a short-memoried
feneration what sort of man
)unc.an is. In 1890, when
the boom was just about
bursting, dear old Gillies
brought in a Bill for build-
ing =£14,500,000 worth of
new railways about 800
miles in all—in the already
over-railwayed province.
Then the House, seeing that
railways were going round,
rose unanimously and every
man demanded lines all over
his electorate, and presently
it found itself seriously con-
sidering the construction of
4400 miles of railway with
>£77,000,000 of borrowed
money. And Duncan, to
all appearance, had no
serious objection to going
right on with the whole
stupendous job; but a panic
fell on the Assembly, and it
fled in terror from its own
monstrosity, and the great
scheme died of inflation.
The proposal to reduce
N.S.W. Civil Service pen-
sions 15 per cent., even if it
were square and honest, is a
miserable shuffling of the
trouble on to the morrow.
The Superannuation Fund
amounts to about .£489,000 ;
it ought to be about
£3,000,000. If all the pro-
spective pensions were can-
celled, and the contributions
came in just the same, and
no payments were refunded,
as provided by the late Act,
to officials who have with-
drawn from the fund, and
the existing pensions were
cut down 40 per cent., the
Fund would crowd through.
Or it would crowd through
if present and prospective
pensions were cut down
about 70 per cent. The 15
per cent, reduction is only
a device to make things last
Reid’s time, so that his suc-
cessor will have to find the
£2, 500,000 or do the actual
repudiation.
The Maoriland Chief Justice has decided
that the “tied” public-house system is illegal
according to a very old statute, which prohibits
“ unreasonable restraints on trade.” If the tied
house system can be abolished the great beer
industry will totter on its foundations, and the
Great Australian Thirst will get an amazing
shock.
The legal trades-union of Queensland has
just, so to speak, put another row of spikes on
the gate and extra broken bottles on the wall.
The new rules for admission make it practically
impossible for another toiler, like Pat Real, to
ornament the Bench.
Two of N.S.W. Co-
lonial Secretary Brun-
ker’s sons are in receipt
of Govt, salaries. E.
Brunker is in charge of
the Customs office at
Morpeth, and draws
=£3Bs per year. G. W.
N. Brunker is local man-
ager of the Govt. Savings
Bank, and also draws
£5O per year as secretary
to Maitland Council.
The voice of Fink,
in Vic. Assembly :
If the banks, with their
careful and economical ad-
ministration and skilful man-
agement, could not make a
profit of 1 per cent, the
business could only be car-
ried on by Government at a
great loss.
That strange, wild cachin-
nation in the distance is
supposed to be the voices
of Drury and Longmuir,
the Men that are Dead,
howling at Fink from
another and a better
world. And the hollow
echo from further back
is the cackle of poor old
ex-banker, Jimmy Mun-
ro, in his little wooden
house-agency office,
where he sits and thinks
of his defunct institutions
and wonders where ’e are.
John Haynes pro-
poses in next session of
N. S. W. Parliament to
move for a Royal Com-
mission to inquire into
the current prison sys-
tem. If the Commis-
sion be appointed, it is to
be hoped that it will re-
commend the abolition
wholly of penal servitude,
and the substitution of
industrial servitude. The
dull, brute mind which
condemns a man to purely
afflictive labor while work in any Govt, depart-
ment needs to be done is the material out of which
the irreclaimable criminal is easily manufactured.
The Leg. Council Committee, which is
vainly trying to unravel Adelaide Hospital tangle,
terminates its existence with the prorogation on
Dec. 18, and as, at time of writing, it had disposed
of two witnesses after three weeks’ work, it has a
hopeless task on hand. In all probability it would
take six months of daily sittings to examine all
the parties concerned, and then no one would be
much the wiser. The Hospital squabble has now
got into such a tangle that no one really knows
anything about it.
THERE WERE OTHERS.
“ Well, you needn't get so high and mighty about it — you’re not the
only girl who won’t marry me!”
Poor old John MTntyre, leader of Yic.
Opposition, has only one answer for every new
proposition—that the matter should be postponed
so as to give time for sufficient consideration. If
old John came across one of those glaciers which
flow three inches in a year, his first idea would be
to suggest that it should avoid undue precipita-
tion.
This is the sort of stuff that the dreadful,
weary O’Malley embalms in the pages of S.A.
Hansard (vide report of proceedings on Wednes-
day, Dec. 2): “ The Hon. Member (Mr. Solomon)
has discharged the loose expectoration of his
intellectual bowels on my democratic head ” .
A PAINFUL SUBJECT.
KIND SHEPHERD : “ You don't attend Sunday-school! Haven’t you been
taught to pray to your Father in Heaven? ”
LITTLE LISA (suspiciously): “No. Muvver told us never to breave ’is
name after 'e was ’ung.”
The Australian Star on Maoriland elec-
tion : “The country had had enough of Mr.
Sneddon and socialistic experiment, and was
resolved to get back to those principles whereon
the colony had been established.” Anybody who
has heard of the recent downfall of anybody
named Sneddon will please communicate with
this office.
Almost the only point on which the M.L.
Tory party committed itself definitely was that
the urgent need of the country was “ the restora-
tion of confidence and faith in the future as a pre-
liminary to the restoration of general prosperity.”
In short, the Tory party stated boldly and con-
fidently that it was m favor of a beautiful greenish
haze trimmed with giraffe sneeze cut bias.
A Hobart lodge chemist the other day
received a prescription signed by the lodge doctor
—“Port wine, ter die.” When referred to
the nearest pub. to have it filled, the lodge mem-
ber (a Rechabite) actually got indignant, and,
when asked how he expected a chemist to supply
him with a bottle of port and medicines also at
the munificent lodge rate of l£d. per week, fell to
language.
The Seating in Shops Bill was under dis-
cussion in the S.A. Assembly, and the clause
which directs that “suitable” seats shall be pro-
vided for women employees was being talked
about. “ What is a ‘ suitable ’ seat ? ” asked
M‘Donald, M.P., whose past career has not been
very consistent. “Well,” answered Kingston,
“the Treasury bench is a suitable seat for
Ministers, but some members appear to be quite
content with a rail.”
Hot Weather Dyspepsia.
Hot weather dyspepsia is easily recognised by
heaviness and pain in the stomach after meals,
loss of appetite, languidness, bad taste in the
mouth —especially on rising—flatulency in stomach
or bowels, headaches, and constipation. These
symptoms of indigestion indicate that the liver is
torpid ; and in fact in a hot climate one’s liver is
the barometer of health. This is why Warner’s
Safe Cure is popular in Australia. The following
letter from Mr. W. B. Carah, wholesale and retail
tobacconist, 232 Swan st., Richmond, dated Sept.
16, 1896, is one of thousands the vendors of this
medicine can produce; “About twelve months
ago I had a very bad attack of influenza, which
left me with severe pains in my back, terrible
headaches, and not only loss of appetite but also
sleep. I consulted a medical man, who told me
that my liver was very badly affected and my
system out of order, and consequently prescribed
for me, but to no good. A friend of mine advised
me to try Warner’s Safe Cure. I bought a bottle.
After taking it I was nearly well, so I kept on till
I had only got through my third bottle when I
was completely restored to perfect health, and
have had no return of the unpleasant symptoms
since. I have also recommended it to a great
many friends with successful results. ”*

Judging by the orders received, this year’s
Xmas Bulletin will circulate over a larger extent
of the earth than any previous issue and will
cover more ground than any other paper ever
published in this hemisphere. It is a monumen-
tal specimen of journalism, and the misguided
person who hasn’t read it has missed something
the like of which he will never see again—until
Xmas, 1897.
The Yic. Government is endeavoring to
push a Usury Bill through Parliament. It pro-
vides that 8 per cent, shall be the maximum inte-
rest on landed security, 10 per cent, on all other
security, and, where no interest is specified in
writing, 6 per cent, shall be the highest rate
allowed by law. Every loan is to be made in full,
the practice of deducting a bonus being absolutely
prohibited. A thick voice can already be heard
in the distance denouncing this as another beastly
interference with the liberty of the subject.
Dear Bulletin, — Be poisoning on W.
Q’sland stations. The food provided for shearers
on some stations consists largely of fermented
jams, damaged flour, rice, sago, and rotten pre-
serves, bought up at auction sales at Brisbane by
station agents at the lowest prices, and sold to
shearers at top prices. Frequently, as a result of
using this unwholesome food, the men become ill
and develop poisoning symptoms. The authorities
invariably jump to the conclusion that the wicked
unionists are to blame, and overlook the proba-
bility of the station itself being a wholesale
poisoner.—C.C. Clermont.
Victoria proposes to reduce the member-
ship of the Assembly from 95 to 80, and of the
Council from 48 to 40. Probably Vic. will be
very sorry for this move later on. It will make
the constituencies larger, therefore contests will
be more expensive, and the Fat Man will have a
better show. As a partial counterpoise, however,
when there are 40 M.’sL.C. instead of 48, there
will at least be a slightly better chance that they
may all fall down in a fit at once, or be struck by
lightning simultaneously, and thus give the
country a much-needed rest.
The S.A. Government’s Land for Closer
Settlement scheme is a fearfully and wonderfully
cumbrous affair. Instead of the Government
obtaining power for the compulsory purchase of
largo estates where land is wanted for settlement,
it is provided that, if an owner has more than
Jl5OOO worth of land, anyone wanting a farm may
select, in his mind’s eye, a piece of the surplus
soil. Then he may arrange with the owner as to
price. The whole land-settlement difficulty lies in
the fact that the big owner won’t sell at a reason-
able figure, or won’t sell at all, and, as the land-
lord can block the negotiation by asking -£l5OO an
acre, the present arrangement doesn’t seem to help
things much. If they agree, the selector can ask
the Government to resume the land at the price,
and the Government will send the matter to the
Land Board to report upon when it is sufficiently
rested. Then, if the report is favorable, Parlia-
mentary sanction will bo asked for, and, when it is
granted, the Government will buy the land for
cash and lease it to the applicant on moderate
terms—provided both parties haven’t died of old
age in the interim, and assuming that all this cir-
cumlocution doesn’t cost much more than twice
the value of the property. The lonesome agricul-
turist who wants to take up a few acres under this
system will need the patience of the immortals.
At one of Stout’s riotous meetings at Wel-
lington (M.L.) a lady elector interrupted the
speaker. Whereupon there rang through the hall
the cry of “Chuck ’er ou-u--u-u-ut! ’' She sub-
sided, therefore she wasn’t chucked. But if woman
is going to take to politics in real earnest she must
grow accustomed to be seized by the collar and
the waistband and scuffled down the front steps
with her hair down and her bonnet over one eye,
when she interrupts a hostile meeting. So far
only one woman has been chucked out in Maori-
land politics, and as an act of courtesy she was
ejected by some members of her own sex. Then,
instead of bombarding the building with road-
metal from outside, which is the orthodox thing
to do, or shoving her umbrella through the glass,
she went away crushed and weeping.
It is a poor, sad, thankless job to run a
strictly party newspaper, and have to prophesy
before each election that the return of your parti-
cular gang of thieves is absolutely certain, and
then to explain afterwards that the awful licking
which ensued is really a “ great moral victory. ”
The last two weeks before M.L. election were
filled with a unanimous whoop from the Tory
press that victory was assured, and there would
be a huge majority, and the two islands would
both be wiped up with Seddon, and all was over
except the drinks and congratulations. It had
said the same thing in ’9O and ’93, but this time
the event was really coming off. Then the disas-
trous thud of the Russell-Stout party was heard
all over Maoriland, and next day all the tired
editors started to explain that it was really a
“moral triumph,” and that they were perfectly
satisfied with the result, and the country was
really yearning for a Russell Ministry, but owing
to various causes, &c., &c., and the beastly cor-
ruption, &c., and the unblushing effrontery and
bribery, and the B.N.Z. swindle, and Ward’s
overdraft, &c., the voice of the country had been,
&c., &e. But in 1899 the outraged nation would
rise as one man against Seddon and dash his head
against, &c., &c., &e.
Mclb. Australasian wants, in the Tory
interest, a reduction in the membership of Vie.
Assembly. In the old days, according to the
Argus’s weekly edition, “ when the Assembly
consisted of 79 members it did its work ever so
much better than it does now. The debates were
brief, but real and effective.” In the Tory idea
everything old was good, and everything new is
all wrong. Consider the record of these brief and
effective old Parliaments : The first session of the
first Parliament represented a year and three days’
continuous jaw. Parliament No. 2; first session, 11
months and one week; second session, nine months.
Third Parliament had one 11 months’ session and
one of ten months. Fourth Parliament, only one
session of twelve months’ continuous shriek. Fifth
Parliament put up a record, inasmuch as it had five
sessions in one year and nine months, and did
nothing, and it had two complete sessions in 4|
months. Eighth and ninth Parliaments had an
eleven months’ session each ; tenth Parliament sat
continuously for months; eleventh
ment had also a session which went straight on for
over a year of incessant yell and execration.
That brings the record up to 16 years ago. And
the Australasian yearns for the brevity and
effectiveness of these good old politicians who
talked each other to death for twelve and fourteen
months at a stretch, and did nothing but throw out
Ministries at the rate of 20 in 26 years; and it
says that the men of to-day are too diffuse and
don’t stick to business.
Dear Bulletin, —There seems to be a
demand in Europe for Australian snakes’ heads,
which are now being exported pickled in gly-
cerine in considerable quantities. To what use
they are put I don’t know 1 Can you inform me 7

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Jack Lyons made 72 in a club-match on
Adelaide Oval, on Nov. 28. This score came just in time
to make the big man a certainty against N.S.VV. on
Dec. 19.
* * • *
S.A. team against N.S.W. on Adelaide Oval,
Dec. 19, will consist of G. Giffen, Jones, Hill, Darling, A.
H. Jarvis, F. Jarvis, Lyons, Reedman, Travers, Evansand
Bailey. Jarvis had a tight squeeze to get in the team, as
M‘Kenzie is considered quite his equal behind the sticks.
Evans and Bailey are new players of promise, the latter
particularly being a fine batsman. The team is perhaps
the strongest S.A. ever put in the field, especially in
batting.
* * * *
The little crowd of 3000, who came to see the
corpse on Sydney Cricket Ground last Saturday, went
home disappointed; the lily-white amateurs couldn’t ride
fast enough to make an accident possible. The new track
could be much worse than it is, but its good time won't
arrive until a big cash-amateur field is going hotfoot for a
real fat purse. Then the crowd will be able to rub its
hands gleefully and sing, “ More work for the undertaker,
’nother little job for the tombstone-maker.” The track is
hard-and-fast, and the cashmen should break both necks
and records on it.
The sum of one shilling sterling was charged for
admission to the ground, and another for the grand-
stand, and the amount of sixpence for a programme—in
all, 2s. 6d. It was the worst half-crown’s worth that any-
body will get for the money, unless he pays the same to
go in again this Saturday. Some three of the amateur
cyclists could ride fast enough to keep warm, but as these
generally waited for the slow ones to make the pace,
racing was rather absent. The slowness was somewhat
relieved in the Novelty race, by making the men dis-
mount and run, wheeling their machines backwards.
Seeing two gophers run would have been quite exciting
compared with most of the performances.
The three Sydney men, Cameron, Hamilton,
and New, were the only ones who had a notion of lifting
her up, and these three, in the interprovincial three-men-
aside team race, came clean away from the Vic. and
Queensland riders in the last lap. Cameron won the
Jive-mile and Hamilton the One-mile championship.
Part of the programme was a so-called “ exhi-
bition ” of pole and high-jumping by an Irish athlete, M.
M. Roseingrave ; it mostly consisted of M. M. It. hitching
up his green pants and passing' remarks, in a somewhat
soprano voice, to his countryman, Malone, who kept
flourishing a stick, after the fashion of an excited Kil-
kenny cat brandishing its tail. To bill Roseingrave’s
efforts as “exhibition” is an obvious and miserable
dodge, because the young man from the green country
can't pole or high-jump worth a straw. The amateur
pole-jump record is lift. 9in., whereas the Roseingrave
“exhibition” scored only Oft. Klin. ; similarly, the ama-
teur high-jump is 6ft. s|in., while the Roseingrave
best is but sft. Oin. Roseingrave’s business is long
jumping, hurdle-racing, pigeon-shooting. But to get him
to do an}' of these things even as “ exhibition,” is about
as sensible as to get the hairy-legged young man to play
twos-and-threes by himself, or to play a game of cricket,
or leap-frog, or football. Any of these things would be
just as diverting as watching a man who can’t pole-jump
fall on the jumping bar and break it in two. Bomehow,
people who run sporting meetings always act on the basis
that the public is a great and universal ass which will
come to see anything. And the public is just now show-
ing by its judicious absence that it is beginning to under-
stand the shallow tricks of the sporting-people.
* * » *
The people who knew all about it for once fell
in simultaneously with the general public over the final
heat of the Austral. Not 10 people in Melb. considered it
possible that Kellow and Walne could make up that cruel
gap of 80yds. and catch the field, and certainly not one of
those 10 would have for a moment believed, prior to the
event, that the Austral of '96 would have been accom-
plished in 2min. 29secs. Kellow’s win was the result of a
combination of skill, pluck, and sound common sense on
the part of him and Walne, and of the utter drivelling
silliness of the men on the out marks. The latter, relying
upon Jackson to rush away as he did the previous Satur-
day, made no arrangements about pacing, and when the
Avoca miner failed to jump to the front they simply
pedalled along at an easy speed looking blankly at one
another, and allowed the enterprising couple behind to
catch them up.
The judging of the race was a fitting consumma-
tion to the other exhibitions of imbecility given by the
M.B.C. officials during the meeting. Whether Walne or
Clinton finished second no spectator has the temerity
to say, but no person in any position in the ground
could avoid seeing Elliott pass the post a full length and
a -half behind both. Yet the judges awarded Walne second
place and Elliott third, evidently never having seen
Clinton at all.
The real quality of such cyclists as Kellow and
Walne is only properly apparent when it is remembered
that last year Crisp won his Austral in 4ni. 42sec., starting
from 255yds. This time Kellow was on 15 and Walne on
20, and they finished first and second in 4m. 29sec. On
an unbanked grass track and with a big field to get round
this is not too bad.
* * * *
A Melb. daily, piqued at being unable to get
full particulars as to gate receipts at the Austral meeting,
has ventured to wonder what the M.B.C. intends to do with
its profits. Tins Bulletin broached this subject a vear ago.
Thus far the prosperous club has not even equipped itself
with a good, substantial-marking board. The amateurish
arrangement fixed up in the centre of the M.C.C ground
on the first day of the recent corroboree broke down
ignominiously on the second d«y, and the winning num-
bers in the Austral final, as proclaimed on the ordinary
cricket scoring-board, were not clear to people in the far-
away grand stand. A half-crown gate fee should cer-
tainly entitle one to a fair chance of knowing who’s who
when the judge gives his decision, especially when the
judge’s decision—as in the case of Elliott’s “ third ” for
the Austral—happens to contain a flagrant mistake.
♦ * * *
Kellow is, seemingly, the levellest-headed biker
in the Victorian crowd. The long man struggles for coin,
whilst smaller and more verdant contemporaries, of the
Parsons class are pumping themselves out in pursuit of
trumpery championships. His handicap performances
speak for themselves. Last New Year’s Day there was a
t'loo stake to be captured on the M.C.C. ground, and
Kellow took the trick judiciously. For the next 10
months he did nothing calculated to excite popular
admiration, but then came a plump little £5O prize at St.
Kilda. Kellow scored again. Victor}' on that occasion
meant a reduction in his start for the Austral—he was put
back from the 30 to the 15yds. mark—but a half-century
in hand was worth £3OO in the bush, anyway. The result
proved that he lost nothing by being put back. Kellow won
the Austral from 15yds. Being now the hero of the hour and
in top form, it was well to improve the shining- hour by
taking- the M. 8.0. Plate, so liellow duly gathered in
another £4O stake. From four races he has drawn £490.
Wise individual. The other fellows can toil for “ cham-
pionships,” with £2O attached, in scratch events. As soon
as a liiy sum of money is seen hanging to a crown of glory
long Kellow will have a good go for the diadem.
* • • *
The Bulletin has received from Barroni, of
Melb., a very fine photo, of O. B. Kellow, winner of this
year’s Austral.
* * » *
Kellow, the Austral winner, before going into
*the cycle business did eighteen months of dry-blowing and
pick-swinging in Westralia. Walne, the second man, is a
bridge carpenter. A constitution built up by hard work
stands to a man in a big contest ; Bilmartin’s great
physique is the production of years of heavy toil.
♦ * * *
The moral of this year’s Austral is that, in order
to win, a man must have a pacemaker. Kellow and Walne,
the back men, agreed to pace each other lap and lap
about; they tossed for choice of turn ; Kellow won ; Walne
began the severe work of pacemaking. Then, as the
field was caught in the three laps, Walne paced two laps
against Kellow’s one, and was necessarily the more ex-
hausted. Kellow subsequently nipped the £3OO first prize,
with Walne second ; but had the pacing turns been re-
versed, the finishing positions might have been reversed
also. Before the race Kellow wanted to “ whack it” with
Walne, but the latter would consent to only a £5O saver.
Supposing that Elliott, or Jackson, or Clinton had had a
pacemaker, where would the scratch men have been.
• * * *
Melb. Age, which has been an insane barracker
for Parsons, passed some ridiculous comments on the
riding of Walne and “ the champion ” in their Austral
heat—the one that Jackson ran away with. Parsons’
chance, according to the penny oracle, was ruined by the
awful selfishness of Walne, who waited behind “ the
champion ” instead of pacing him. Owing to the publi-
cation of this balderdash, perhaps, the man from Banana-
land paced Parsons for all he was worth when they came
together again in the third heat of the M.B.C. Plate, and
the result was as before. Walne, who lost many yards by
running wide, finished second ; Parsons couldn’t live with
him when the pinch came. Subsequently Walne (10yds.)
ran a respectable second in the Austral final, timed 13sec.
faster than last year's. In 1895 the overrated Parsons,
starting from scratch in the Austral final, never got near
to the winner, wherefore it may be reasonably assumed
from inter-annual time-test, as well as from latest “ form,”
that Walne can beat Parsons on their respective merits in
a two-mile handicap provided there be sufficient cash in-
ducement for him to do the deed.
* • * •
An all-important difference between horses and
cyclists has to be considered by racing tipsters. The horse
doesn’t know whether he is racing for £lO or for £3OO,
whereas the man does know, and, according to the value of
the stake, he is apt to lose his perve or otherwise.
Backers of Jackson for the Austral could see—if they had
intelligent eyes—that the red-hot favorite racing anxiously
in the final was not the same Jackson who had won his
preliminary heat without once looking over his shoulder.
The boy MTnnes was another palpable sufferer from
nerves.
* * * *
The forthcoming Martin-Parsons matches are,
on latest evidence, a good thing for Martin. The strong
plugger, after his two months enforced rest, is in the
rosiest of health, and his track-work is consistently
excellent. Parsons, on the contrary, is “ streaky ’’—bril-
liant to-day, dead-slow to-morrow. The distances are :
One mile (unpaced), five and ten miles (paced). Martin
will have A 1 pacing. The betting at present is 4tol on
plugger Bill. The pair, like Gaudaur and Stanbury before
their match, are “just like brothers.”
* * * •
R. Lewis, Megson, and Payne, the three N.S.W.
cyclists who went all the way to England to get well
beaten, when they could have got as well beaten by stay-
ing at home, have duly returned to Sydney. The doings
of the three make slow reading. Lewis started four times,
fell twice, lost four times ; Megson started six times, fell
thrice, lost five times ; Payne started seven times, fell
four times, lost seven times, and was suspended for
“ arranging a race.” The belated youths had a dull time
in England, for between the climate and their falls upon
the cement tracks they spent their days in rains and their
nights in plasters.
* * * *
Said that Parsons is suffering from inflamma-
tion of the intestines, first induced by iced drinks in
America. What is really the matter with Parsons, how-
ever, is the result of being frozen out in so many races
of late.
* * * *
Ken Lewis is still there with his splendid sprint,
winning the mile and five-mile international scratch
races at Adelaide last Saturday, and downing Relph, the
new Englishman, the Midland Counties champion. Lewis
sprinted away from Martin the last time the pair met.
He has perhaps the best-proportioned physique of any
cyclist in Australia : he weighs 9st. 121 b, stands sft. 9in.,
and measures 40in. round the chest. He comes of an
English father and Irish mother, and is an all-round man
—cyclist, boxer, swimmer, footballer, buckjump rider,
&c. He has put in plenty of solid work on farm and
station. He is 24 years old, and during the nine years he
has been cycling he has won altogether some £llOO.
* * * *
The great and only Bilmartin shortly intends to
start tandem, and will take to his loving heart the pretty
daughter of a Ballarat chemist, who is also the niece of
a well-advertised parson. The lady is one of the tip-top
musicians of the goldfield city, and, as Bill himself can
warble a little on occasions, she will probably piny his
accompaniments in future. The above statements will
be duly contradicted in next week’s Bulletin. The ap-
proaching marriage of a great man like Bilmartin is
always announced and contradicted a few times before it
really comes off.
* * * *
On the bike, as at every other kind of athletic
contest, a good big man is better than a good little ’un.
The big man is beginning to come freely into the fray.
Bilmartin grows beautifully less by comparison, and
Parsons—why, that pale young man will be nowhere
before he’s five-and-twenty.
* * * *
Tasmania has the bicycle-craze badly. The
latest victim is the Solicitor-General, who collided with
another bikist, and had to sacrifice two good Supreme
Court briefs because it was incompatible with his dignity
to appear in court with two black eyes, enlarged nose,
disarranged scalp, and considerable gravel-rash.
* ♦ * *
At ’Ome Lord Durham is on the warpath re the
vagaries of handicappers. In N S.W. some owners and
trainers have petitioned the A.J.O. committee with re-
gard to the patchy performances of their well-paid official.
A glance at the weights for Villiers Stakes and Summer
Cup will show any judge of weight-adjusting that there is
great room for improvement in the handiwork of the
A.J.C. official handicapper. Lord Durham’s suggestion of
two handicappers working conjointly deserves more than
a passing thought.
**. * *
Astronomer (Castor—Frailty), who cost 1575g5.
as a yearling, won his first race at recent Randwick
meeting. He is a horse likely to train on into a good ’un,
and, with but 7st. 61b. to carry, he should be near winning
the Carrington Stakes on New Year’s Day. Whv the
handicapper only raised him 61b. for his victory is un-
accountable.
« » * *
Fleet Admiral (Richmond—Footstep) has started
from Adelaide to Sydney, where he is to take part in the
valuable December Stakes. This fine-looking brother to
The Admiral was second in Maribyrnong Plate and third
in Nursery Handicap at recent Flemington meeting, so
that a great race should be seen between'him and Patriot
in which the latter may just get the better.
* * * *
A M.L. tote-record was put up at recent Can-
terbury Jockey Club meeting, when, in three days,
£47,076 were put through the machine ; previous record

One curious feature of the smellful Perturbation
case was trainer Teddy Power’s morning telegram to the
ua. l Racing Club stewards, announcing that he had
sold the horse, and would be in nowise responsible for its
performance a few hours later. Power’s telegram sug-
gests a suspicion that something crooked was likelv to
happen—and, if so, why ? J ‘

ness as though nothing had occurred. But where’s the
good in such petty improved regulations, as long as'three
out of every four trainers and jockeys are unpunished
offenders who deserve blotting out for evermore 9
* * * *
The Y.R.C. seems not very anxious for an
enquiry re the alleged attempt to “ stiffen ” Thunder
Queen for the Oaks. A bookmaker’s name is mentioned
and two versions of his ill-fated misdemeanour have gone
the rounds. One yarn states that he administered a dose
personally or by proxy, to a horse in mistake for the mare,
whilst the other narrative declares that Thunder Queen
was properly hocussed, but too late in the dav for the
drug to achieve its mission. Behind these misty rumors
stands the large, unalterable fact that Ikey Mo in general
fielded against Thunder Queen for the Oaks as though he
knew she couldn’t win, whereas on paper the favorite
couldn’t very well lose. The story of the nobbling is sup-
ported by the eloquent testimony of figures in sundry
books. Nevertheless an inspired turf authority thinks
it “extremely doubtful if anything will come of the
matter.”
* * * *
The results of two principal handicaps at Rose-
hill last Saturday point to the undeniable chances pos-
sessed by Balance, Sabretache, Moorefield and Cartridge
of winning some substantial prizes at the approaching
Randwick meetings. The military double. Cartridge and
Sabretache, “on paper,” looks well for Villiers Stakes and
Summer Cup.
* * * *
The long-suffering flatite at Randwick pays his
shilling and gets very little for his money. Scratchings,
starters, &c., are to him an unknown quantity, as no
information on these very important racing points is
vouchsafed him, barring the few almost indistinguishable
hieroglyphics displayed at end of members’-stand in the
sacred lawn. Flatites don’t, as a rule, run to binoculars,
so a board, on which starters’ numbers and riders’ names
are legibly exhibited, should be provided by the rich
A. J.C. for multitudinous shilling patrons.
* * * *
I lattites at Rlemington don’t pay for admission,
yet grumble and are listened to. Their brethren at Rand-
wick do pay the humble shilling, don’t grumble much,
though they have legitimate cause to, and their interests
are not studied in the least. Surely before approaching
big summer meetings the A. J.C. authorities might have a
board erected with the horses’ numbers legibly displayed
for the information of the many shilling patrons who can-
not sport binoculars to decipher the numbers exhibited at
end of members’ stand in lawn.
* * * *
Dear Bulletin, —It is true, as “S.S.” writes,
that the V.R.C. derives a little money from the Plat at
Flemington. But the few flattites who contribute towards
the support of the show are not the grumblers. The cry
for a grand-stand gratis, and the suggestion that refresh-
ments ought to be thrown in, comes from the deadheads.

Of all the Merry Christmases that will in-

effectually prevent gravy on the ceiling, or stuffing

Dear Sir,— l have suffered from Indigestion, Dys-

the last five years, and have tried several so-called
cures without getting relief. I have also been under
the treatment of six doctors, but without effect. See-
ing your advertisement of Wahoo in the papers, I
thought I would try it, and, though not expecting it
would do me any good considering my age (63 years),
I found your Wahoo simply marvellous. I had only
taken a few doses when I got relief, and now feel in
better health than I have for many years.
Yours truly,

CHAT WITH AN EX-DE-
TECTIVE.
NARROW ESCAPES OF A RETIRED
OFFICER.
Mr. Richard Wood was not at home when, says
an interviewer, I rang the bell at his residence,
Norfolk House, Cornwallis-street, Hastings, but
whilst I was inquiring he was pointed outcrossing
the road. His hale and hearty appearance, ereet-
ness of stature, and cheeriness of manner, seemed
almost to belie the fact that ex-Detective Sergeant
Wood was, as he subsequently told me, turned
sixty-five, and that many years of his life had been
spent in active service, exposed to all weathers,
and engaged in arduous work such as cannot fail
to tell on the physical frame. I asked a few
questions about his experience.
“ Yes,” he said, “ I was often exposed to risk.
Sciatica being my chief trouble. I had suffered
from it off and on for about fifteen years, and a
little while ago I was very bad with it. I think
no man has ever had sciatica worse than I have.
When I was in the police-force I have lain on the
floor all night in the police-station, and they have
had to bring me home in a cab.”
“A short time ago I hear you had an excep-
tionally bad attack! ”
“Yes, and my wife thought that I should not
get over it. My case seemed hopeless. You can
hardly name a medicine that I have not taken.
But these Pills that cured me as soon as I got to
know them—Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale
People, I mean —are nothing like other medicine.
I was induced to use them through reading of the
wonderful cure of a woman at Dungeness, and,
having done so, I consider they are the medicine
for any person ailing. I feel quite a new man.
The Pills have put new nerve into me. I used to
have a good nerve at one time when in the police-
force, and wanted it for some of the jobs that I
had to do. The continuation of this sciatica and
rheumatism —I also used to suffer from pains in
the head —tended to weaken my nerve. But now
I have got the nerve to go out and hit a lion. The
sciatica and rheumatic pains have entirely gone
from the hips and shoulders and other parts.”
Further interrogated, the ex-detective said he
regarded the Pills as “the best medicine that is
made.” He was now equal to walking almost any
distance—could walk to Eastbourne, 1(5 or 17 miles.
Perhaps Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale
People never had a more enthusiastic endorsement.
Mr. Wood was only too anxious to tell in his in-
teresting and intelligent manner of the tine remedy
! he had proved Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills to be, as
they are in all the many disorders which arise from
an impoverished state of the blood and nerves,
such as anaemia, pale and sallow complexion,
general muscular weakness, loss of appetite, short-
ness of breath, pains in the back, nervous head-
aches, early decay, all forms of female weakness,
\ hysteria ? paralysis, locomotor ataxy, sciatica,
palpitations, low vitality, and wasting from any
cause.
Dr. Williams Pink Pills are obtainable from all
leading chemists, or from the Dr. Williams’ Medi-
cine Coy., N.S.W., Sydney, who will forward
(post paid) on receipt of stamps or post order, 1
box for 2s 9d, or for 14s 9d.

COMPLETELY CURED HIM,
Mf. T. J. Clune, of Walkerville, Ade-

“Six years ago, I had an attack of
Indigestion and Liver Complaint
that lasted for weeks; I was unable
to do any hard work, had no appe-
tite, food distressed me, and I suf-
fered much from headache. My
skin was sallow and sleep did not
refresh me. I tried several reme-
dies and consulted a doctor, with-
out obtaining any relief; finally,
one of my customers recommended
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. It helped me
from the first, —in fact, after taking
six bottles I was completely cured,
and could eat anything and sleep
like a child.”

The Salvationists are going into the food

said Commandant Booth, the other day, “he
thought that they would be able to show a model
hotel, a model restaurant, where a man for a
penny, or possibly for a halfpenny, would obtain
the wherewithal to stay the cravings of hunger.”

“Papa’s Hair.”
A gentleman has sent us the following “ A few
weeks ago I bought a bottle of your ‘ Papa’s Hair,’
and it has acted with the most satisfactory results.
Previous to doing so, my hair had a mousey color
streaked with grey. The dear children would trv
to count papa’s grey hairs, but, because of the
number, could not succeed. Being only 44 years
of age, I determined to improve my hair, and tried
your ‘ Papa’s Hair,’ and am pleased to write that,
though at first there seemed little difference, gradu-
ally the hair regained its original color (there was
no dyeing whatever) and it is now strong and glossy.
I asked my little daughter this morning to count
my grey hairs, but when looking for them she cried
out— 1 Why, papa, there are no white hairs; mamma
must have pulled them all out.’ ”
This Preparation is not a Dye, but acts gradu-
ally on the Roots of the Hair, and restores Grey
Hair to its natural color and lustre.
No preparation will make hair grow better than
“Papa’s ILair.”
It effectually prevents the formation of Dandriff,
as it is called, the presence of which always denotes
diseased action in the cuticle of the scalp, causing
premature baldness, or a falling off of the hair. °
DIRECTIONS.—WeII shake the bottle, and with
a small piece of sponge rub into the roots of the
hair, night and morning, till the hair is restored to
its natural color ; afterwards apply twice a week.

N.S.W. District Judge Coffey holds that
police evidence as to statements made by un-
defended prisoners should not be admitted unless
the policeman has warned prisoner beforehand
that the statement may be used. The distinction
here between a defended and undefended prisoner
is not clear to the eye of reason; but it is rather
anomalous that the law does not oblige a police-
man to warn, and that about half the N.S.W.
Judges say he should warn and half say the re-
verse.

But few of noted specialists have sprung into pre-
eminence and an immense practice as Surgeon Langston,
a resident and practitioner at 121 Collins-street, Mel-
bourne. His name has become almost literally a house-
hold word; almost every" other man you meet has a
wonderful story to relate of some almost miraculous cure
he has performed in are acute or chronic case of long
standing, where other physicians have failed. He ad-
dresses himself in particular to cases that have baffled the
skill and science of other doctors. His name is a suffi-
cient guarantee of a perfect cure of every case he under-
takes. Consult him this day. It may save you much
mental and physical suffering, and add golden years to
your life.
YOUNG MEN.
You will find this distinguished doctor your best
friend and benefactor. If you are troubled with weaken-
ing dreams, unrefreshing sleep, a tired gloomy feeling, and
loss of energy, ambition and self-confidence, which im-
pair both your body and brain, and absolutely unfit you
for study, business, or the proper enjoyment of married or
single life ; if you are suffering from these or similar symp-
toms you know the cause. Do not allow false pride and
sham modesty to deter you in seeking relief. Before it is
everlastingly too late, consult this reliable old specialist,
who thoroughly understands your trouble, and can treat
it with unfailing success.
MIDDLE AGED MEN.
There are many of you afflicted with weak, aching
back and kidneys, loss of mental and physical power and
vigour, wasting weakness, and not unfrequently accom-
panied by an impairment of the general health. In justice
to this celebrated specialist it can be truthfully stated that
in all such cases of middle aged men, as well as of young
men, his success has been almost invariable.

troubles of every kind, name and nature,

A clergyman, on a holiday trip, visited a
blacks’ camp for the purpose of teaching the
Lord’s Prayer to the heathen ; having repeated it
many times to them, he wished them to say it
after him. Old gin (loq.): “ You bin yabber,‘gib
um daily bread,’ ‘ gib um daily bread.’ Why not
gib it more plour ? ”
Dan. O’Connor writes to The Bulletin
that a statement reprinted from Sydney Tele-
graph, to effect that, at Bathurst Convention,
“ Mr. D. O’Connor, M.L.C., filled in the ten
minutes that remained before the adjournment for
the garden-party in praising Bathurst and every-
body connected with it, as well as the speakers
who had preceded him,” is “ grossly false.” As a
matter of fact, Dan. says his speech was as con-
cise and pertinent a reference to the Federation
cause as time would allow, and “several promi-
nent gentlemen waited to congratulate ” him
upon it.

Australia, consists wholly of new matter in prose

“ The origin of organic heart-disease in
nine cases out of ten is rheumatism.” —New York
Medical J ournal.
N. S. W. Labor Minister Garrard declares that
the local unemployed are nearly absorbed, and in
proof explains how hard it is to get men to go
“scrubbing” to the Bogan. Does a kangaroo
willingly run to be shot ? Does a man earnestly
beg to be sent to starvation, destruction—Sheol ?
The fact that 100 fresh men can be got every fort-
night to heave mullock about at Botany Sewage
Farm for 6s. per day, and that Randwick Relief
Works and that hell on earth, Shea’s Creek, are
kept going all the time (to say nothing of the 900
that Sydney Benevolent Asylum is feeding), is
proof that the unemployed will for a long time yet
sit heavily on the chest of the jolly and fat
Cabinet.
The Eye-sight measure sent per post by
the inventors, Messrs. Greenfield and Barraclough,
the well-known opticians of George-st., Sydney,
is a wonderful little contrivance which will enable
eye-sufferers in the country to ascertain the data
necessary for obtaining proper spectacles. The
subtler forms of sight-defect cannot, of course, be
measured by the instrument, but it is thoroughly
effective for the more usual forms of eye affection
such as long sight, short sight, old sight. Full
particulars from Messrs. Greenfield and Barra-
clough. *
R. Temperley, a North Coast (N.S.W.)
journalist, lecturing in Sydney the other day,
reiterated that the whole of the Northern sugar
district was “slowly but surely drifting from a
flourishing white man’s territory into a district
of Hindoos. Leaving the Clarence district
out of the question, there were 500 colored
people on the Richmond and Tweed alone,
and even on the Clarence River black faces
were not uncommon. In one mill on the Tweed
River were now employed 200 kanakas.” This
colored labor was not employed in the Colonial
Sugar Co.’s works, added Mr. Temperley, who,
like every other Northern trader, has to be careful
what he says about the big monopoly. No ; but
the C.S.R. Co. crushes the cane grown by black
hands ; and it has imported thousands of coolies
for its black-labor mills and plantations in Fiji,
established in deliberate competition with the
North Coast farmers, for whose interests it pleads
so pathetically with the white side of its face.
THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
°f opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems.*
A certain recent butchery—which con-
sisted in the demolition of an aged couple in their
own house, for no visible purpose—has got strangely
mixed up. The assassin left nothing behind him
which looked like a clue, therefore the nearest
badly-dressed man was arrested, and a witness
was found to swear profusely against him. Never-
theless, the case broke down for want of anything
like reasonable evidence. Then the wife of said
witness learned, or thought she did, that he had a
previous partner still living, and that she wasn’t
his wife, and in her wrath she rose up and de-
nounced him as the real culprit. The local authori-
ties are consequently in a complicated situation.
The wife’s evidence is reckoned good against her
alleged husband if she is not his wife ; if she is
his wife it isn’t. Therefore, the first business is to
find the alleged first wife, and convict him of
bigamy, and then convict him of murder on the
evidence of the alleged second wife, unless she
repents before then and retracts everything she
has said. As no one has yet contrived to lay
hands on the first wife, if there is such a person,
things haven’t got fairly started. Until she is
found there is no visible evidence on which to
arrest the suspect on a charge of bigamy, and
until the bigamy is proved there is no good legal
evidence on which to arrest him on the other
charge. Therefore, he walks about at large, and
the local force is fast going off its head with worry
and suppressed excitement.

Blow, my bujly boys, blow ;
Shout the good old packet’s praises—
Blow, my bully boys, blow.
Lively Loo from Boston sailing,
All the girls were left bewailing
Blow, blow, my bully boys, blow.
Left and right the guns went banging, whistles
tooting, bells a-clanging ;
Lots o’ gilt to that trip hanging,
Worth the risk and worth the fight.
Timbers ripped and sails all tattered,
Wheel-house smashed and starn-post shattered,
This same planking blood-bespattered,
Hiram Brown got through all right.
Lively Loo she took my' fancy—
Blow, my bully boys, blow ;
So I shipped with Captain Clancy
Blow, my bully boys, blow.
• Wind abaft—a lively breeze —
Sailed away to China seas—
Blow, blow, my bully boys, blow.
When the Yanks had finished shooting,
Hiram Brown she went recruiting—
That dark trade her skipper suiting
In the year of sixty-eight.
Changed her flag and got new papers,
Alter’d down to funnel scrapers,
But she starts her same old capers,
Seemed they couldn't run her straight.
Sad we left our loves behind us—
Blow, my bully boys, blow ;
To be true they iong enjoined us—•
Blow, my bully boys, blow.
But we found in foreign places
Welcome smiles on fairer faces—
Blow, blow, my bully boys, blow.
Blackbird cargo, soon she’d gathered—blackbird
cargo, tied and tethered—
Rain and storm and wind safe weathered,
Sou’ by East away she slips;
Maybe cargo wasn’t willing, when with snowy
sails outfilling,
And the bo’sun’s whistle thrilling,
Squared away that pride of ships !
Oh ! our skipper was a daisy—
Blow, my bully boys, blow ;
Drove the whole fo’castle crazy—
Blow, mv bully boys, blow.
So wo left him ruck and rumbo
In the harbor of Colombo —
Blow, blow, my bully boys, blow.
On and off the coast o’ Chili, Hiram Brown she
kept until he
Made us think he’d gone quite silly,
But one night a schooner come
Right ’longside, and making fast, sir,
O’er our side in haste she passed, sir
(With a look-out on the mast, sir),
Six-and-eighty casks of rum !
“ Lively Loo” was heard no myre on— l
Blow, my bully boys, blow :
Went one night a dark lee shore on—
Blow, my bully boys, blow.
Sharks, they ate the old man’s nose off,
Bit his ears and then his toes off'
Blow, blow, my bully boys, blow.
Schooner on her way is going, when our skipper,
cute and knowing,
Sets that rare old stingo flowing—
Taps a cask and treats his men ;
Steam’s got up, she makes right down there to
some small plantation town where
Niggers black and niggers brown there,
Served their Dons (for nothing)—then
Longshore lasses came to greet us—
Blow, my bully boys, blow.
Bumboat men were glad to meet us—
Blow, my bully boys, blow ;
Sold our togs to buy bad liquor,
Pawned my pants and popped the ticker—
Blow, blow, my bully boys, blow.
Got our casks ashore at first, boys ; guess that job
would raise your thirst, boys ;
Maybe one or two was burst, boys,
Though for that we didn’t stop ;
Landed niggers next right slickly, ranged those
casks on wharf corrictly,
Then (obeying orders) quickly,
Perched a nigger each on top.
Got another ship to sail in—
Blow, my bully boys, blow ;
Went to Arctic Ocean whalin’—
Blow, my bully boys, blow ;
Struck a ’berg one night and sunk it,
Cold as ’ell, but couldn’t funk it—
Blow, blow, my bully boys, blow.
Then our skipper, sleek and smiling, in a manner
most beguiling, *
Law and commerce reconciling,
Mounts upon a cotton-bale,
Joking with the senors lightly, speaking Spanish
there politely,
Calm and cool, collected,-sprightly,
Starts a lively auction sale.
Saw a “ right whale ” busy “ spoutin’ ”
Blow, my bully boys, blow ;
“There she blows,” the look-out shoutin’—■
Blow, my bully boys, blow ;
“ Lower away,” and off we goes, mate,
Sticks a harpoon in her nose, mate—
Blow, blow, my bully boys, blow.
Each rich Don who wanted labor understood his
planter neighbor,
So their troops, with gun and sabre,
To arrest us did not come ;
Whilst our captain grow elated as the bids were
elevated,
And the same, you'll guess, related
More to nigger than to rum.
Off she goes and us behind her—
Blow, my bully boys, blow ;
Got a calf, but never mind her—
Blow, my bully boys, blow ;
Down she dives, our lances shunning—
Keeps the harpoon-reel a-running,
Blow, blow, my bully boys, blow.
So each buyer quick would figger out the value of
the nigger,
And the auctioneer would snigger
When he threw the barrel in !
Guess that cargo paid her owners : likely they were
psalm-song groaners,
Scripture-text and proverb moaners,
But they winked at tricks o’ sin.
Up she comes, and right beside us—
Blow, my bully boys, blow ;
Goes about-now, woe betide us— ■
Blow, my bully boys, blow ;
Turns her tail gee-whoop and thrashed us,
Into fifty pieces smashed us—
Blow, blow, my bully boys, blow.
Hiram Brown’s been o’er and under, cross the
seas in storm and thunder ;
Some rough night she’ll go asunder,
And Old Nick will have a lark.
Jack’s poor lass will be a griever—
Haul her in and hitch and heave her ;
Guess next trip the rats will leave her—•
She’s as old as Noah’s ark.
Missed the coxswain as we wallowed —
Blow, my bully boys, blow ;
Angry whale poor chap had swallowed —
Blow, my bully boys, blow.
Second boat, she saw her spout then,
Killed the whale and cut him out, men—•
Blow, blow, my bully boys, blow.
There’s the guy-rope rigged and ready !
Got your hatches broke already ?
Let her zip ! Hey, winchman, steady,
Case o’ hardware marked “ B.A.’’;
Longshore loafers down below there,
You’re too denied infernal slow there !
Hook away, and up ye go there !
Yankee packet’s in, hooray !
Vankee packet’s down the river—•
Blow, my bully boys, blow ;
Fifteen hundred bales to give her— l
Blow, my bully boys, blow.
Wey-hey-ho! Wey-hey-Ho!
Fill her up and let her go—
Blow, blow, my bully boys, blow.

The Journal op Cutaneous Diseases tells
of a Venezuelan lady, who had contracted leprosy,
being regularly visited by an American lady
friend. Before the Venezuelan lady died, her
American lady friend was a leper; before the
American lady died, a favorite nephew living in
her house had to be removed to a lazaret.
Another woman who had once been a lazaret
attendant developed the disease 14 years after
leaving the post. In a N.Y. case a woman had
acquired the horror through living for a year next
door to a man afterwards found to be a leper.
Leprosy (mat pake) was introduced into Hawaii
in 1838 by a Chinese cook in a native family. In
less than 10 years all the family and many friends
in their set had it; now Hawaii is one huge lazar*
house.

Chat with an Ex-Detective.
HARROW ESCAPES OP A RETIRED OFFICER.
Mr. Richard Wood was not at home when, says an in-
terviewer, I rang- the bell at his residence, Norfolk House,
Cornwallis-street, Hastings, but whilst I was inquiring he
was pointed out crossing the road. His hale and hearty
appearance, erectness of stature, and cheeriness of man-
ner, seemed almost to belie the fact that Ex-Detective
Sergeant Wood was, as he subsequently told me, turned
sixty-five, and that many years of his life had been spent
in active service, exposed to all weathers, and engaged
in arduous work such as cannot fail to tell on the physical
frame. I asked a few questions about his experience,
j “ Yes,” he said, “ I w’as often exposed to risk. Sciatica
being my chief trouble. I had suffered from it off and on
for about fifteen years, and a little while ago I was very
bad with it. I think no man has ever had sciatica worse
than I have. When I was in the police-force I have lain
on the floor all night in the police-station, and they have
had to bring me home in a cab.”
“ A short time ago I hear you had an exceptionally bad
ittack?”
“ Yes, and my wife thought that I should not get over
t. My case seemed hopeless. You can hardly name a
medicine that I have not taken. But these Pills that
pured.me as soon as I got to know them—Dr. Williams’
pink Pills for Pale People I mean—are nothing like other
medicine. I was induced to use them through reading of
he wonderful cure of a woman at Dungeness, and having
lone so I consider they are the medicine for any person
fling. I feel quite a new man. The Pills have put new
lerve into me. I used to have a good nerve at one time
i’hen in the police force, and wanted it for some of the
obs that I had to do. The continuation of this sciatica
nd rheumatism—l also used to suffer from pains in the
ead—tended to weaken my nerve. But now I have got
he nerve to go out and hit a lion. The sciatica and
heumatic pains have entirely gone from the hips and
houlders and other parts.”
Further interrogated, the ex-detective said he regarded
he Pills as “ the best medicine that is made.” He was
ow equal to walking almost any distance —could walk to
astbourne, 16 or 17 miles.
Change of Life.
DIZZINESS AND SHORTNESS OF BREATH CURED.
What Dr Williams’ Pink Pills will do for women at the
cnange of life is shown in a case reported in the Dewsburv
(Eng-.) Chronicle. It is that of Mrs. Benjamin Smith
who lives at Hanover-street, Dewsbury. The chance of
life had left her weak and miserable ; with constant pains,
dizziness, and shortness of breath on the slightest, exer-
tion, together with chronic rheumatism in the head and
eyes. The pain in her head was too acute for words : she
got no sleep either by day or night; and her agony was at
times so great that it took two people to hold her in bed.
A skilful doctor was called in, but did no good. “My
cheeks would swell up as big as saucers,” says Mrs
*!.• ’ ‘™ y eyes were as red as fire, and there was no
getting rid of the pains in the head. I also suffered from
ssliifjishliverinda weak heart, and at times mv eye-
sigbt was so bad that objects before me seemed but dim
shadows, and there were none of my friends who looked
for my restoration to health.
I saw an account in a newspaper of a cure similar to
mine through the use of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, and mv
husband urged me to try them. Before two bottles were
used the pains had disappeared as if by magic, and the
continued use of the pills for a little more than a month
has left me enjoying as good health as ever I had in mv
life I consider Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills a blessing, and
as I know there are thousands of women who suffer in
silence from troubles having the same origin as mine I
am grateful enough for what they have done for me’to
tell my story in the hope that some suffering sister mav
be similarly helped, and you have full permission to pub-
lish what I have told you, which statements can he veri-
fied by any of my neighbors,” This wonderful remedy is
offered to the public with a full confidence that there is
no disease arismg from a watery or impoverished con-
dition of the blood, or shattered nervous forces, which it
will not cure if the directions are faithfully followed and
the treatment persisted in. Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for
Pale People are not a patent medicine, but are a
thoroughly scientific preparation, the result of years of
careful study on the part of an eminent Edinburgh
University physician, and they were successfully used by

Repeated expression of gratitude for a marvellous
a Weybrid S e lady attracted the attention of a
Surrey Times reporter to her extraordinary history. The
result wa s that the reporter proceeded to a pretty little
lodge just off the high road, at St. George’s Hills Wev-
b ridge, where he found Miss Bartlett. She said : “ I was
very ill indeed, but now, I am glad to say, I am quite well
I was quite weak and bad, so that I could not do anything.
I was almost helpless. I could not get any sleep at

An Interrupted Ceremony .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Heard at a distance, the strains that filled the air
round the little iron shanty were musical enough,
mellowed with the softness of tongues that lisped
through an unknown language :
He is a rock in a weary land,
A wea-ry land,
A wea-ry land,
A shelter in the time of storm.
Parson Phillips, glancing in at the door of his
little mission house, could not forbear an amused
grin across at the “lady-teacher” as Kanaka
Georges loud wail of “wea-ry land” rose high
above all other voices in the glory of a newlv-dis-
covered tenor. Miss Ross did not smile. This
work among the Kanakas was an intensely earnest
business with her. Her eyes shone proudly
out from her thin sun-bleached face at the
two long rows of scholars on either side of
the table. I hey sat very close together, with their
elbows stretched over the rough pine boards, and
their black heads clasped in their hands. As the
hymn ceased she hurried forward with a pile of
paper books. 1
You must let Mr. Phillips hear how well you
can read now,” she said. “Will you begin,

and twined distracted fingers in his black

And—it—came—to—pass ” -
Miss Ross was still alert and interested when,
the class over, the Kanakas filed out of the hot
murky room, stumbled nervously over the door-
step, and passed out of sight on to the dark road
George was still airing his tenor, and his mourn-
a land ” echoed with the departing
the* liX’ S J le f a v lk h r eavil y into a chair and
the light died out of her face. She looked old
and careworn and unutterably weary. The hot
moist night air filled the little room ; the heat of
the sun still lingered on the iron roof and walls.
1 he mosquitoes buzzed angrily round her hand as it
pushed the hair back from her forehead. The torn
thumb-marked books were scattered on the table •
there were dusty footprints on the floor. It was
all very sordid and mean, now that the glamour of
zeal ha,d passed away. She was so tired of it all
so tired but she dared not give in, for had she
not resolved that all her life now must be one
on f act °* reparation. She started to her feet
and began hurriedly to tidy the room, to push
back the forms against the wall, to collect the un-
Hm!, fXh S ui 6 da !' ed , not rest > rest meant
time foi thought, and thought meant ! Oh
God it was hard. Had she not repented, and
was she not giving up her life to others, and yet
she cou] ( ! not once forget her great sin. For-
get Were there not even now times when her
heart was broken with the remembrance of a
™' a V grass-grown mound, and her whole being
filled with a passionate longing to hold in her arms
a tiny form that had never rested in them, and to
gaze into a little face her eyes had never seen.
. S V ’ w< ,'r e there not wild moments when
she felt she could abandon all and give up her soul
tor the pressure of one man’s lips upon hers and to
see those eyes look love into her own ? Then she
would start up and work feverishly in her little
house, or, if it were night time, she would fall on
“er knees and force her mind to concentrate itself
on wild prayers, until her tired brain relaxed and
she woke hours later to creep, cramped and
shivering, into her bed.
She was glad, after such a night, to wake to the
knowledge that it was Sunday morning, and that
on that day at least there was small time for in-
truding thoughts. In the morning there was the
church-service, and then came exhausting Sundav-
school teaching in the heat of the afternoon.
Although it was July, the day was a still one, and
the crowded school-room was oppressively close.
She was struggling to make her story interesting
and to keep little heads from nodding when she
was called away.
Miss Ross,” said the Parson, “there’s a poor
chap got smashed up in a dynamite explosion at
the mines m Woody Island. Gould you go to him ?
T>n C f ll ii t P ossibl y £ et away till after evensong, but
111 follow you then.” .
How soon can I go ? ” said Miss Ross, putting
on her hat. °
‘ The boys are getting a lugger ready now. It’s
a long walk when you reach the island, but I’ll
send George and his wife with you. She is a
£'J n ° bl woman and as good as a man in a boat.
Ihey will carry my little medicine-chest and any
comfort you can think of.
“ft’ B , 3, sad story, his,” he went on as they
walked down the hill, ‘ ‘ and it shows what vicissi-
tudes men go through in this country. He was
once private secretary to a Governor, and a great
dandy, as I remember him fresh from home. He
went the pace a bit, I fancy. Rutherford his
name is.
Miss Ross stopped short. “ What ? ” she gasped
the blood rushed to her head—“ what? ”
Phillips looked at her.
. “P° y° u klloW him ? ” he asked curiously. She
bit her lip to stay its trembling. “I used to
once, she said.
“But you will go to him?” said the man
anxiously, as she did not move.
Yes. she said after the least possible hesita-
t’on - „ 1 will go,” and her step never faltered as
she walked down the hill.
* * » *
It was midwinter, but the names of the
seasons are of small account in the latitude of
Woody Island. It was midwinter, and the island
lay m the dazzling blue water, burned and parched
and panting for rain, with the heat mist dancing
above the red soil, giving a hazy indistinctness to
the brown, coarse grass and the stems of the screw
palm and stunted ti-tree.
The dust and sand rose in a cloud before the
woman s feet, the heat scorched through her shoe-
leather. On all sides among the scrub rose the
grey rock-like ant-hills, jagged and solid-looking,
like so many rough-hewn tomb-stones, making it
h i ■,/ olle to believe them the work of so tiny
a builder. It was a dreary, sun-scorched road,
with occasional minute patches of shade from the
yellow-blossoming wild cotton-tree, where the
leaves were glued together in ominous green
bunches, warning the wary of the swarming green
ants on every twig.
Ihe familiar old hymn tune was running in her
head and her steps kept time with its refrain—“a
wea-ry land, a wea-ry land ” —as she struggled on
footsore and half-exhausted. The Kanaka and
his wife sauntered easily some dozen yards behind
her. How and then they said a few words: and
once a laugh floated forward to her ears, and the
incongruity made her start. Her heart was throb-
bing until each breath was difficult. At last, at
last she was to meet him again—him who had
brought so many years of misery upon her, but
who had once loved her ; for whose sake she had
committed the unpardonable sin winch no years
of repentance and self-sacrifice could expiate, and
yet whom she forgave and loved still, as women
ha y e don e before} and will do till the end of time
He had left her to bear alone her time of agony*
and her shame and misery, and now he was
dying, and m his turn was lying uncared for and
alone. A wea-ry land, a wea-ry land.” She set
her teeth as she stumbled over the sharp stones or
sank m the hot loose sand.
* * * .
All had been done that was possible, and
he lay there with closed eyes—dying. The woman
b n Sld ® hlrtl . and Ilfted his hand to her face,
i ij iii passion she pressed kisses oh it and
held it to her cheek. The blood had rushed to her
face, and her eyes shone strangely. She was young
again. Then he looked up at her, at first with
heavy, dazed eyes, and then with a look of recog-
nition. The end was near and he had outgrown
surprise. 6
Gwen™ ! ” 116 Said in a w h> s P er j “ dear little
And then, as she knelt and trembled before
niin, the past became clearer.
I was a brute to you, Gwen ! ” he said in a
stronger voice “ a damnable brute. Poor little
girl, have you had a hard time ? ”
A great sob burst from her—a sob filled with the
unspoken misery of years. She could say nothing,
but she clutched his hand more tightly in her
shaking fingers. “ Poor little girl ! ’’ he said again
and his eyes close-d. She held some spirits to his
lips and gently wiped the damp from his face, but
tor long he lay motionless, while she crouched at
his side, watching and waiting. The evening
~ a^ d ’'I 1 ® room became dark. A man
shuffled to the door on stockinged feet, and gave
her an ill-cleaned hurricane-lamp. The light shone
dimly through the smoked globe and made flicker-
mg shadows. Ihe flies awoke and buzzed round
i . And then he looked at her again, and raised
himself on the stretcher.
„ “There still, Gwen ? ” he said, with a smile.
xou won t leave me now, dear, will you ? I
wish I could do something for you, just to make
up, he said wistfully, “ but nothing can mend
the past. Ah, Gwen, if I could only marry you '
But Pm dying, old girl.” J J
At his words she started forward, and gazed
eagerly into his grey, drawn face. Her hands
were clasped beseechingly, and her words came in

any difference to you now. Marry me, and let me

running down her cheeks. The man looked at
her wonderingly. “ But I am dying, dear. I

. Ah, wait a little—a few minutes more, beloved !
just a few minutes more ! ” She raised his head
till it leaned on her breast, on the heart that was
throbbing to suffocation.
To her it was an eternity before she heard a
qmck step outside and the opening of the door.
Rutherford heard it, too.
We won t have the burial-service just vet

give us holy matrimony.” Phillips thought he
was wandering and looked inquiringly at the

Writes- J . Bull, jun.,” to The Bulle-
tin:— The average out-back Australian is a
curious animal. He mostly lives in a two-roomed
hut with a hole in the roof to act as a chimney. A
small stool stands outside the back door with an
mu tln -dish and a piece of soap at the end of it.
lhe whole family washes out of this dish, and
when water is scarce the one dishful does until
the end of the week. There is usually a water-
cask alongside the house out of which the fowls,
dogs, calves, and the average Australians drink
whenever they feel dry. The boss of this hut is
usually called a selector ; this is because he always
selects a bullock from a neighboring run whenever
his beef-cask gets a bit low.” Which latter re-
mark is perilously near poor Walter Cooper’s his-

and repaired her by filling the space between the
disconnected ends with mashed bone.”
