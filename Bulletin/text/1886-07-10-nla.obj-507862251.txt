SATURDAY. JULY 10. 1886.
A n old acquaintance masquerades this week
in unaccustomed guise. “ Plain Bill,” late
of the Soudan, now figures as the “Right
Hon. William Bbde Dalley,” the only
member of Her Majesty’s Privy Council in
the Australian colonies. The alleged
honour thus conferred has been hailed with
a burst of maudlin enthusiasm from the
Australian daily press, and on all sides con-
gratulations have poured in upon him, the
Plain William of days gone by. The
unique nature of the distinction has been a
subject of ceaseless comment, and Mr. D al-
ley is held up in marked contrast to the
whisky knights and the motley horde of
miserable C M.G.’s who loaf at every street-
corner in our Australian cities. To us it
certainly appears that in this respect, and
in this alone, the new Privy Councillor de-
serves the warmest felicitations. It is some-
thing to escape the badge of Sfc. Michael
and St. George, especially in these degener-
ate days when the spurs of knighthood
jingle behind the counter of the corner
grocery, the corner grog-shop, and the
corner loan-office, and the honour is won
by aldermanio gluttony instead of on tbe
battle-field. The Brummagem nobility of
Australasia is the vanguard of British
Jingoism, and the titles which its members
sport with so much complacency have, as
rule, been conferred in order to confirm
their loyalty to the moth-eaten traditions
by which it is hoped to bind the man-
hood of the colonies for good and all
to the effete and decaying aristocracy
of Great Britain. The colonial knights
are almost without exception traitors
to the cause of Australian Democracy.
They have been bought, and the miserably
low price paid for them has marked the
contempt in which tney are held. But in
some few cases a barren distinction has been
offered in gratitude for favours gone by
rather than in payment for favours to
come, and this is Mr. Dalley’h case. The
unusual honour with which he has been
distinguished marks at once the greatces i
of his services to Britain and the crushing
weight of the calamity he brought down
upon Australia. It is the “ Man of Soudan ”
whom the Sovere’gu delights to honour,
and the “ Man of Sedan ” whose title
sounds strangely like his—the man who
threw away a glorious empire in a single
summer day—never made a greater blunder
than that to which Mr. Dalle? owes his
elevation.
* * *
“Save me from my friends” are words
which the new Privy Councillor might
well use in his unaccustomed position. He
is in name a Liberal of the Liberals, and yet
the Globe, the journal which is supposed to
be the voice of the Radical party in New
South Wales, sinks into abject Toryism, and
is forced to drag its idol down to its own
level, as it congratulates him upon the
distinction he has achieved.
“ He knows nothing,” it says, “ of Australian
interests when they clash with the projects or
necessities of the Empire. . . . Mr. Dalley
has throughout keen the councillor of the Em-
pire, and not the Australian politician. His posi-
tion is perfectly intelligible and eminently satis-
factory when compared with that of some other
statesmen who blow the trumpet of Imperialism
one day and twang the horn of local interests the
next, and stili make boast of a patriotic consis-
tency. The only possible logical positions are—
for ChESAR or for self. Mr. Dalley goes for
CLesar, and obtains Cjesar’s reward. ”
Nothing could be truer than these words,
and no condemnation could be more crush-
ing either to the politician cr the patriot.
Yet this blighting anathema is meant as
praise. “He knows nothing of Australian
interests when they clash with the projects
or necessities of the Empire,” and yet the
man of whom this is written is himself an
Australian, conspicuous among the trusted
representatives of the Australian people,
and the guardians of their honour and their
liberty. The proudest boast that can be
made on his behalf is that he has fanatically
sold his country, and done his best to make
a whole continent subservient to the tra-
ditions and prejudices of the Empire, the
instrument to be utilised in its unjust
quarrels, and the weapon with which it is
to enforce foreign tyranny aid prop up
brutalising despotism. Only the blind and
bigoted devotion which here masquerades
under the name of loyalty could excuse in
MR. T. WILLMETT.
President of the North Queensland Separation League.
even the slightest degree the atrocious
wrong which Mr. Dallev committed when
he called upon free Australia to aid in
riveting fetters on the oppressed tribes of
the Upper Nile. And yet, strangely enough,
Australia glories in its shame, and glories
in the man whose blundering brought this
shame upon its head. Mr. Ballet went for
CLesab, and CLesab has thrown him his re-
ward as a bone is thrown to a dog. His
elevation is the result of an undertaking
which history will declare to have had but
one redeeming feature—the pitiful, degrad-
ing, contemptible failure, which saved a
national disgrace from becoming black
enough to be designated a national crime.
* ♦ •
No one can doubt, however, that Impei’lal
selfishness has done well when it selected Mr.
Dallev for a rarely-cooftrred honour. In
the opinion of our British rulers every man
has his price, aud ttiey naturally considered
that such a man as tbis would require some
higher reward than that generally dispensed
to colonial statesmen. For orce, however,
they were wrong. Mr. Dallby’s whole
course of action we believe to have been-
the result of sincere conviction, and for that
reason we declare his political existence to
be a dire national calamity. If he could be
bought in the cause of Australian demo-
cracy, his brilliant talents would make even
his venal services well worth any price that
his colony could pay, but he is not for sale,
and the man who throws away his country’s
honour and interest for conscience sake is a
living disaster inflicted upon the land. He is
an Australian by birth, and yet he is more
thoroughly English Jingo than almost any
Englishman in the British Isles. Brought
up under an Imperial regime, he has breathed
jn, from his earliest youth, the worst form
of Toryism, like tbat bumptious autocrat,
Sir Jambs Mabtin, and many others who rank
among the shining lights of Australia. He
has learned t > worship the system of British
monarchy through viewing it from afar
off, where only its glitter is visible, and the
misery on which it is founded islost to sight.
His loyalty is widely different from the
ignorant, brutal Toryism which debases the
Legislative Council of New South Wales,
and while a grander, it is a tenf m re
disastrous sentiment. But his priv**..
acter as a high-minded, generous man, a
cultivated gentleman, and a worthy patron
of literature, will have an effect in his new
position which would probably be alto-
gether incomprehensible to the majority of
Englishmen. The simple fact that he bears
a title conferred by the Queen will, among
the ignorant, do much to lift these
“ honours ” from the mire of contempt
and public derision into which they had
hopelessly sunk. The mere circumstance of
titles being conferred on such men as
Graham Berry, the Radical renegade, and
Robert Stout, that strange compound cf
Liberalism, Toryism, blatant infidelity, and
noisy tcetotalism, who is dragged as a cap-
tive at the chariot-wheels of his sturdy
Treasurer, to say nothing of many ap-
pointments [of a still more question-
able character, was beginning to open
the eyes of the colonists to the fact
that honours are distributed not to
those who have served Australasia well and
truly, but to such as promise to be pliant
instruments in the hands of the London
lords and princelings. The fact of Mr.
Dallev being named a Privy Councillor
marks no departure from this unvarying
rule, but the private character of the man
whom the Queen delights to honour, will
serve to make people think the tinsel bribes,
which are so profusely distributed, are
something else than a badge of degradation
after all. The act is merely a part of the
unceasing, and so far very successful, Jingo
conspiracy, by which it is hoped that Aus_
tralian bone and sinew, to say nothing of
Australian wealth, may be utilised “in
time of need ” to prop up the ruined tyranny
of which Britain is already weary. Lord
Cabington’s appointment as Governor of
New South Wales is another item in the
same scheme, for the colony had become
disgusted with an almost unbroken suc-
cession of useless viceregal shadows, and it
was felt necessary, [by [way of reconciling
this nation to the chain, to send out some
one whose social qualities would make the
people forget the utter worthlessness of the
system of imperial Government which he
represents. >
m • e
The new Privy Councillor has long since
lost all claim—if he ever possessed any—to
rank as a representative Australian. The
man who bears such a title must be the
leader of the coming generation, not merely
the voice of that which is fast passing
away ; and the principles on which Mr.
Dallby’s whole career has been founded
are a sort of which even his contemporaries
are tired, and from which his successors will
turn with disgust. To the future Australian,
the political bigotry, which is now termed
loyalty, will be as incomprehensible as the
mysteries of Obi; its adherents will be
classed with the gallant fanatics who fought
to maintain intolerance and tyranny in the
days of the Stuarts. For the present, how-
ever, Australia Is governed to a great extent
by men who are English either by birth or
sympathies—by the class who howl for the
throne and the “good cause” of the
Empire at municipal gorges and “loyal”
gatherings, and of these Mr. Dallev is an
advanced type. But the time is fast ap-
proaching when there will be in the Aus-
tralian colonies 500 Australians to one
Briton, and 1000 Republicans to one who
either cares for or sympathises with Im-
perial England. It is the dream of madmen
that this great continent, animated with
the strength and enthusiasm of youth, and
with resources sufficient to build up a dozen
mighty commonwealths, should consent to
be bound for ever to the festering corpse of
monarchy, and should obey for ever an
absent and invisible Sovereign who claims
its allegiance on tho score of traditions
wnion grew in dark ages at the remote
antipodes. Not even Mr. Dallby’s unques-
tioned ability, nor the ability of a hundred
such statesmen as he, could ever bring these
transplanted traditions to vigorous growth in

tmid a multitude of weightier considera-
ns there is also a ludicrous side to the
w Privy Councillor’s sudden elevation,
uong the supporters of his policy the
tion seems current that in his new posi-
m he will bring his experience to bear
,on the concerns of the Empire and take a
ble position among British statesmen,
is convenient, in this moment of tem-
rary elation, to forget that the Privy
)unoil is almost as obsolete and quite as
iwerless as that of the famous Ten which
tied in mediaeval Venice. Nearly a life-
ne has elapsed since the Queen summoned
gether the 200 white men who are sup-
ped to guide the destinies of Great and
reater Britain, and even then they met
at to give advice but to listen to the an-
mnoement of Her Majesty’s set purpose,
id to bow in solemn acquiescence. Mr.
alley has been promoted to the rank of a
mncillor who gives no counsel and who
ould not be listened to if he did; he has
sen “graciously” appointed to the billet of
voice crying in the wilderness, with the
spress understanding that he is not to cry
md enough to be heard; and he has the
rivilege at state ceremonies of walking in
ront of Sir Judas Bbrby, and some distance
ehind that respectable though rather
loodthirsty nigger, the Shah of Persia^
7ho in his rank of a knight of the
jar ter will elbow Mr. D alley to the
ear. But while his position as a dead
louncillor is humiliating, to be a live one
rould be utterly ruinous. It may be plea-
ant to imagine that the appointment has
iesn made because Her Majesty feels the
irgent necessity of having at least one
>rainy adviser to prop up her throne; but
upposing that such were the case, Mr.
Dallby would require to bolster up the
’eeling Empire by means of the Eastern
Extension Company’s cable, at an annual
lost which would utterly wreck his for-
tunes. The one chance of greatness which
tiis position offers lies in the possibility that
some day a terrible catastrophe may sweep
Bff the Cabinet, the House of Commons, and
the balance of the Privy Council at one fell
swoop, and, in that case, Victobia and
Dallby would between them run the
Imperial machine until further orders.
But this contingency is, after all, rather
remote, and until it occurs the Right
Honorable W. B. Dallby will wield no
m»ore potent sceptre than did Plain Bill of
|;he Soudan.
• * •
On the whole, therefore, we are not jubi-
ant over Mr. Dallby’s elevation. We do
aot for a moment suppose that the new
aonour will make his Jingoism a shade more
pronounced —indeed, to do so would be
hardly possible—but the hope of such a
reward as he has obtained will buy venal
men body and soul to the unpatriotic party
which desires to sacrifice Australia on the
altar of Imperial Federation, and waste Aus-
tralian blood and wealth in the unjust
quarrels of England. Rather a thousand
times would we have seen the title which
Mr. Dallby now holds conferred on one of
the grovelling, whisky-selling, whisky-drink-
iug K.C.M.G.’s. Further, we would be among
the first to congratulate Charley Roberts
on his elevation to a dukedom, or the newly-
laurelled champion blatherskite on a pro-
spective marquteete, feeling fully convinced
that the honours on had been well be-
"eCdWoll- but we decline to felicitate William
Bbde IKllby on having stooped to earn, or
stoopedto receive the title which has been
fastened’ike a badge of servitude round his
neck. He had two courses open to him,
and he deliberately chose the worse. It was
in hispower tc he one of the B reat Baders of
a party which would insist on the adoption
of a policy of and progress in Austra-
lia, and claim tor us the right to abstain
from sheddinghlood in unjust quarrels-a
right enjoyed hy the great American Re-
public, the mightiest commonwealth the
world has ever seen, which celebrated the
110th anniversary of its emancipation
from I imperial chains a few days ago—but
he preferred to be known as the man who
first aroused a spirit of;military aggression in
the colonies, and who taught the lesson that
glory was to be obtained by attacking the
feeble and the oppressed. He went for
CLesab, and truly he has gained Cesar’s
reward.
The Freedom of Contract.
Thus an out-spoken correspondent;—“ Your views
on the rights of labour question are altogether
wromr Every Labourer has the rmht of making
a contract for his labour, and any unions made to
ston him from doing this are opposed to the Con-
stitution, for Parliament itself cannot make a law
to take away from a man his freedom to make
any contract he likes.”
The mistake of our correspondent is a very
common one. It is frequently stated that no law
can prevent a man from doing as he likes with
his own, and that he has full liberty to make any
contract or agreement he chooses. But in reality
£bls liberty is in complete subjection to the laws,
and the State does restrain its exercise when pre-
judicial to the putllo good. Thus a man has no
power to make a contract which shall prevent
another from engaging in business, although the
latter for consideration 'may wish to make such
an agreement. A limited restraint is all that can
be effectually imposed. Thus, if A signs a bond
purporting to restrain him from re-engaging in
business under a penalty payable to B, such a bond
without qualification as to place is void and worth-
less. Freedom to make such a contract does not
exist, for it is against the public policy that men
should be restrained from trading. Nor can a man
bargain away his equity of redemption at the time
of making a mortgage, and any contract or agree-
ment for that purpose is entirely void. A com-
moner Instance of the restriction of the liberty to
make a contract is noticed in the interposition of
the law to prevent a person from purchasing
liquor except between stated hours. The publi-
can’s freedom to contract with purchasers for the
sale of his goods is strictly limited by laws made
for the general welfare of the community. The
fact is that this freedom of contract, like all other
liberties, can only be exercised when it is not re-
pugnant to the policy of the State.
* * *
Touching the right of unions to interfere with
this liberty of the individual, we would atsist our
critic by quoting the S.F. Argonaut in his favour
as follows:
“ The labour market, like all others, is governed
by the law of supply and demand. Capital should
not be permitted to forestall it by any conspiracy,
nor Labour to interfere with it by any .organi-
zation.”
In each sentence here plausible words ooncea]
actual facts. It is presenting a false analogy to
speak of the labour “market.” A market is a
place where buyer and seller meet on equal terms
Neither is obliged to contract, and will only do so
upon favourable terms. The value of commo-
dities in such a case is regulated only by supply
and demand, and the prices vary accordingly. But
Labour and Capital are upon quite another foot
ing. The workman is compelled to sell his ser-
vices, for he rarely has resources which enable
him to exist even for a short time in Idleness. The
employer, on the contrary, can; look up his money
for years in any one of a thousand investments,
therefore he is able to dictate terms to those who
would obtain employment. The price of labour is
regulated by the cupidity of capitalists and the
necessities of the workman. Starvation pangt
force the latter to accept starvation wages; and
the prospect of huge profits induces the capitalist
to pay what are now regarded as high rates. The
so-called “ labour-market ” is a meeting of thost
who must sell with those who are free to buy oi
not as they choose. The one class is plainly inde
pendent; the other acts under the fierce compul
sion of necessity. And the greater the necessity
of the worker, the more miserable and inadequatt
is the sum he willingly accepts. It is to the interest
therefore of the employers that the sellers oi
labour should be reduced to starvation, for everj
advance on the road to destitution means a corre-
sponding reduction in the wage demanded. Under
such circumstances the agreement between thi
parties is not a contract; it is a surrender of the
weak and helpless to his Inevitable conqueror.
And when men relied upon this “ freedom of con-
tract ” and fought slngly.it was found that thost
of their comrades who were destitute of resources
accepted for their labour terms not in accord
with its productive value, but in proportion t(
their own distress. The wage in this case was thei
made the standard by which all labour of thai
class was measured, and the whole body of workei i
were brought down to the level of the mosi
destitute among them. It became apparem
then that the vaunted freedom of contract
■was a delusion. Fair contracts can onl;
be made between parties equally Independent
and mntil Labour is organised and federated, it
will never meet its present enemy but future ally
upon equal terms. Labour must organise or b<
rrushed. Capital already is, and always has been
organised; the union of its members is effeotet
br their possession of money. No capitalis'
would be generous enough to knowingly giv
more to his workman than others of his class au
giving under similar conditions. That men oi
the contrary are, or were formerly, s.parate units
is consequent upon the fact that the wage each li
forced to accept must be measured by his owi
proxlmltyito starvation, not by the sum his more
fortunate fellows may be enabled to obtain
Capital is organised naturally, and until Labour 1
artificially consolidated, the freedom of its con-
tract with its present opponent will be similar t
that which France enjoyed when, with her territory
in the possession of the Prussians, she contractet
to pay away her milliards to the conqueror.
• • ■
To return to our correspondent. He asserts tha
law cannot take away a man’s freedom to mak<
any contract he likes. It will probably be news t(
him to know that in meet parts of the Brltisl
territory a workman is not permitted by an;
■ document or bond, to sell to his, employe
his right to sue for compensation if he 1
injured by negligence or fault 'of the master,
The law recognises that the weaker party must b
protected against his own necessitous condition
and just as it prevents a mortgagor from sur
rendering his rights of redemption, so also i
denies to a workman any freedom to contrac
away his right to claim compensation for injurier
h e may receive in his ma ster’s service. The rea •
son of the interference is similar in each case
Were the mortgagor or labourer, free to re
nounce bis right to redemption in the one case, oj
compensation in the other, his necessitous condi
tion would enable the other party to force him tc
do so. Until Labour is organised it will ever be
weaker than its federated antagonist— Capital.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Judas of Radicalism.
The Bulletin's cartoon on this hero does not
affect to praise Sir Graham Berry, K.C.M.G., hut
all who have followed the career of that exceed-
ingly clever politician will admit that the allusion
to a traitor who hanged himself 1850 years ago is a
perfectly just one. Sir Graham has yet to receive
36 other pieces of silver tinsel. These wi
he obtained upon introduction to “ Wales ; at
jingo meetings when he prophesies Imperial
glories ; at gatherings of the holders and wor-
shippers of wealth ; and at sumptuous banquets
given by rich Tories and toadies. Even in his
titled degradation, contempt for tte man must be
mingled with pity for his fall. No Colonial poli-
tician has ever had fairer assurance of a noble
career. Gbaham Berry, the Radical, held the
political future of Victoria in the hollow of his
hand. He could have laid the enduring foun-
dations of a magnificent Democracy ; he might
have secured to all the rights for which he so
eloquently pleaded when he was singled out as the
exponent of Radicalism in Victoria. But with
power came the lust of Imperial honours: he won
the victory only to betray the cause. Conservatism
was his Cleopatra— he vanquished it in fight
only to be overcome by its allurements. Hence-
forth Sir Graham Berry will be a prominent
figure in Australian politics, for his treachery does
not deprive him of his undoubted talents, but he
has stooped from the high pedestal which he once
occupied; he will be merely a toady among
toadies, a groveller among other grovellers-that is
the sum of the price for which he has betrayed the
Gospel of National Greatness. He might have
been a Washington —he is now only a shade
above Heaton.

Nominee Meddlers.
The Legislative Councillors of New South Wales,
as if bent upon demonstrating their worse than
uselessness as a part of the Constitution, never
lose an opportunity of proclaiming their senile
imbecility and political bigotry. If a spoke can
be put in the wheel of progress a majority of fos-
silised drivellers in the Council can be confidently
relied upon to do it; if a useful reform Is desired
the Nominee Chamber stands ready to deny it
every time. But during the last fortnight the
councillors, exhilarated by their mischievous suc-
cess in the past, have gone a step farther and com-
mitted political sacrilege by interfering with a
measure, the Stamp Bi'l, imposing taxation. The
English House of Lords, strong in the conscious-
ness of hereditary power, would not dare to do
this. The principle affirmed in the 14th ceniury,
that the power of taxation Is dependent upon re-
presentation of the persons by whom the tax will
be paid, is strictly regarded by the peers,
and their own exclusive right over money
bills is most jealously guarded by the Com-
mons. The Lards may throw out, but may
not alter or amend any measure Imposing
taxation. Yet, in spite of the example set by
these English Lords, New South Wales councillors
whose term of mischievousness is limited to the life
of each nominee, presumptuously dare to impose
taxation upon people whom they never repre-
sented. And the action of the members of the
i epresentatlve chamber is but little less culpable.
They saw their privilege trampled upon by nomi-
nees of the Alexander Campbell type, yet did
lothing to resent this arrogant impertinence be-
yond laying the Bill aside and introducing
another in its place. They betrayed rank cowardice
when they should have ttood firmly on their
lights. The amendments made by the Council
g hould have been struck out, the Bill restored to its
original form, and returned to its antiquated muti-
1. tors. Accepting the rebuff as they did, the mem-
b rs of the Assembly have established a precedent
v. hich will be used against them when the inevit-
able contest between nominees and representa-
tives takes place. The incident is disgraceful to
both parties. The arrogance and apathy, inso-
lence and cowardice displayed therein, compete
openly for the public contempt.

Vale, Von Mueller—Vale, Hayter !
T as new regulations of the Victorian Civil Service
a-e making a happy despatch in the cases of many
officers whom Mr. Gillies’ benighted Govern-
ment will never be able to replace. A number of
g ntlemen holding Important positions are to be
“ sacked ” at the close of 1886, on the ground that
they have attained the age of 60 years, and among
f am we find with amazement the names of Baron
V >n Mgblleb, the Government Botanist, who, as a
sc : entlst, is known all over the civilised world, and
Mr. H. H. Hayter, the famous Statist. Wiih re-
gard to the former, it is possible the rulers of Vic-
toria, whose own botanical knowledge does not
extend far beyond tomatoes and irrigated cab-
fa ges, regard him simply as a bloated aristocrat
■with a mania for vegetables, but it will probably
b 3 a few centuries before the services of another
suoh man are placed at the colony’s disposal.
Tie vast stores of knowledge possessed by
the Baron would have gained him a high
position in any country in Europe, and there
ho might have become a centenarian if he
pleased, without being displaced, but in Vic-
toria he has been for years throwing his pearls
b f ore —Tvell, the animal is so well known that it
1 not worth mentioning, As for Mr. Hayter, he
1, the only statist of note in Australia, and the
t (Acuity of replacing him is shown by the fact
that in New South Wales a similar officer was
s ught for during several j ears without success.
Even now that Mr. Coghlan has been ap-
pointed he finds it necessary to consult
the gentleman whom Mr, Gillies is so
anxious to get rid of, in order to gain an insight
into the work required in his new position. Un-
f jrtunately, however, the new rule does net seem
to apply to Premiers, cormorants, governors, and
.other officials who might be easier spared than Mr.
jfIAYTER or Baron Yon Mueller, otherwise there
•might be some hope of sending Mr. Gillies him-
self into private life one day to the great relief of
the sorrowing nation.
Got ’em Again.
A fierce attack of Imperial jimjams still
afflicts the majority of Australian newspapers and
politicians. It became epidemic just before the
Soudan coup, and, fomented by the gift of Im-
perial distinctions, titled Governors, and the flat-
tery of Jingoism, has now, we are certain, reached
its crisis, it is impossible for us to believe that
Lord Carington, even with the aid of all his sec-
retaries, can officially utter anything more out-
rageous and absurd than his speech on the occa-
sion of the American celebration banquet, nor
can we believe that the Right Hon. W. B. Dalley
will ever succeed in piling a future Pellon upon
the Ossa of Monday night. It was only to be ex-
peeted that the Governor should judge upon
he evidence of an American crowd who
jheered the Prince of Wales, and the added
es imony of State messages, that America is fer-
vidly anxious for an alliance with England, for his
very position and rank teach him to overlook the
bought of a nation and Interpret their sentiments
by the number of hats thrown in the air. Royalty
s always assured of the devotion of the people,
and all evidence favourable or otherwise is tor-
tured to support that confidence. Carington
hears that a few]Americans cheered “Tummy”; he
concludes, therefore, that the whole American
people want “ Tummy” to reign over them. This is
Royal reasoning, and therefore befits Carington.
And Dalley fol'owed in the same illogical,
omotional style. With a comprehensive glance
which refused to be restrained by facts and the
plain deductions therefrom, he prophesied an early
union of the two nations, England and America,
and, taking a still higher flight, he added:—
“Upon the Entrlish-speaking peoples of the
world the duty will be cast sooner or later of
maintaining—nay, commanding—its peace, guard-
ing its liberties, and perpetuating lt« Institutions.
(Cheers.) They comprise already 330 millions of
the people of the world under opr own empire,
and more than 60 millions of Americans.”
This is splendid balderdash. Love of freedom
urged the Pilgrim Fathers to emigrate and settle
in the States; the same sentiment lei to
the rebellion by which Independence was
won; and it is still the same cause which makes
Germans, Irishmen, Frenchmen, and Englishmen
flock to the Great Republic. The intelligent
Ameri.an imtlnotiveiy looks to England as the
abode of national and class tyranny. He knows
that in the pursuit of Imperial glory the most
brutal outrages have been perpetrated, and a heavy
burden of debt laid upon people who care
nothing for the honors of war and only desire
peace. And he turns to his own home, and re-
members that either he or his ancestors have come
there simply that they might be able to eijoy
freedom and the blessings of peace. Such
boons he would not exchange for oceans of
Imperial glory. British glory means the butchery
of hapless patriots in the Soudan, Burmab,
and elsewhere: it includes the oppression of the
tolling millions of India. What classes of Ameri-
cans do our Imperial orators expect to yearn for
an alliance with England ? Are they ihe 10 millions
of negroes who know that their enfranchisement
was delayed by English money, arms, and doc-
trine; are they the 8 millions of Irish descent who
regard England with a hatred, which distance
modifies but cannot remove; are they the 13
millions who are of German and Dutch parentage;
or are they the native Americans who regard their
Republic as the hub of the universe? Which of
these would be will’ng to join with England to
help keep the universe in order?

His journalistic career commenced on the Atlas
in 1847, and he was also connected with the Empire,
the Daily Telegraph, and Kivebina Herald.
He was noted for having possessed one of the
largest assortments of political opinions on record,
and for having supported at different times almost
everything and everybody under the sun. But he
always maintained the opinions which were upper-
most in his mind for the moment, with vigour and
honesty, and energy, and his loss will be much felt
both in political and liteiary circles.
The election of a woman as a church-

“ The Foxes Hava Their Holes."
Chuistianity with comfort is the motto of ser-

did not, mark jou, stay to enquire whether it was
the churchwardens, and not goats, who had
camped in the verandah. Perhaps he was afraid
to discover that the churchwardens were goals
This is mere flippancy, however. What we wish
to point out is tha" when the manger-torn Foun-
der of the Church, of which this fastidious
gentleman ii a minister, remarked that “Foxes
have their holer, and the birds of the air their
nests, but the Son of Man hath not where (o
lay his head,” he would not have despised the
shelter of that same “two-roomed slab building”
at which His servant (what a wealth of sarcasm
lies in this phrase I) turned up his reverend nose.
But then the religion He came to preach had not
developed into a business in His days. Those who
espoused it were told to take up their cross-not
their cookirg-stoves and grand pianos and Amerf-
can trunks-and follow Him, Such an invitation.
If addressed in these times to those who now re-
present themselves as his followers, would be
received either as the utterance of a harmless
lunatic or the joke of a low comedian of the
drollest type. Yet we wonder where Christianity
would now be if its promoters had been men of
thii kind. It might posdbly have a paragraph
to itself in an ecclesiastical dictionary, but
it would have no living memory among men.
The Pauls, and Peters, and Timothys,
and Silases, and Judes, and Jameses, who built
it up and made of it an Ark of Refuge in the
shoreless ocean of unbelief—a celestial citadel Im-
pregnable agaicst the gods of gloom-did not
study their personal comfort much when they
went out preaching, or “shake the dust off their
feet ” when the only accommodation they could
obtain was a cow-shed, not to speak of a two-
roemed slab building. They did not stipulate
whin they answered a "call” to some distant dia-
trict, that a “ parsonage ” fitted up with the latest
improvements and adorned with Pompeiian pot-
tery and curtains of Syrian purple, also a
well-filled larder and a cellar crammed with
Massio and Falernian should be ready for
tlumon their arrival. They asked no questions,
but simply got up, put as much black bread
and onions as it would hold into their wallet,
and-went. If they hsd to go by land they walked,
when nobody would give them a lift: if by water,
they went as stowaways, when nobody would give
them a free passage. This was the way in which
the Christian Church was built up. But, it may
be said, now that it is built up, even to the very
gilded erors on the steeple, there is no further
need of Its ministers practising self-denial or de-
priving themselves of their little luxuries. Cer-
tainly there is not—as far as its ministers are con-
cerned. They have nothing to fear in the shape
of reproof from those above them. All—or nearly
all—are tarred-with the same brush. The Lust of
Life is strong upon them, and not to be conquered.
There are some few noble exceptions—men who
have sacrificed rank and riches to work without
fame and without reward, save such as springs
from their own approving ccnsc'ence, in dismal
deserts or squalid slums -but they are far too few
to make our generalisation incorrect. Yet per-
haps these few are found sufficient to save the
Christian Church from being swept away even as
were the Cities of the Plain-a Dead Bea of obli-
vion lying motionless over it for ever. But the
practice of some of the virtues they preach—
charity and self-denial partlcularly-lf not con-
sidered essential to clergymen in these times, is
most surely essential to the Church. It is already
totter’ng from steeple to basement, and unless
some great Architect arises to strengthen and
gradually renew it from the foundations, it will
some day fall in upon itself with a crash and bury
Its fat priests and pompous hierarchs and sleek
psalm-singers under a cairn as big as the Blra
Nimroud. Of course we are speaking metaphori.
cally now. But the plain English of the affair is
that all these will have to go around one day and
hunt for their hash instead of being fed up like
prophets as they are at present. That day may be
far off—which causes us to say that the existing
race of dervishes need not live in slab-buildings or
do without their wine at dinner and their fresh
jsint every day with four or five kinds of entrees
and ail the rest of their little comforts. The
church will last their time. But they are making
it exceedingly rough for tfecir successors.

It is a severe blow to Australian loyalty to

one of his sons instead. In the end the choice will
probably be between Battenberg and Prince

vote for the blighted Battenberg. He would feel

Sir Charles Dilke has been more Turkish

with Miss Shiel, a very handsome Irish girl, they
separated on the morning of the wedding at the
church door, the bride saying, jauntily, “ Good-

meet at tea,” and on her death, some year and a

a process not then in vogue.
The Protestant world affectionately re-
members that it owes a revelation to Leopold Von
Ranke the illustrious historian, news of whose
death was cabled to Australia a few weeks ago.
Half a century since it was fondly believed that
Protestantism was everywhere gaining on Catholi-
cism and that with the spread of enlightenment,
what Protestants regard as “The clouds of super-
stition” were blowing away. It was Von Ranke who
taught the world that the fact is the very reverse,
and that during the past 250 years Catholicism has
gained on Protestantism. At the middle of the
seventeenth century the Protestants probably out-
numbered the Catholics; to-day, the latter are
probably more numerous than the former by 20
per cent. Two hundred and fifty years ago the
peoples of France, Austria, Southern Germany,
Poland, Belgium, and Hungary bade fair to become
Protestant, and Protestantism had a fighting
chance in Spain and Italy. Now all these countries
are solidly Catholic, and there is no more chance
of winning them over to Protestantism than there

The other day Lord Rosebery paid at auo-

landwriting of Robert Burns; at the same sale
Sir Robert Jardine bought another such book for
$10 guineas. The book was described in the cata-
ogue as original MSS. by Burns; but it has since
been discovered that of 16 pieces of prose and
verse in one book four are merely copies, and in
the other, II pieces out of 17 were merely tran-
scribed by the poet for reference from the Scots’
and London magazines and other sources. Since
this disclosure the vendors and the purchasers
have come to an amicable arrangement as to the
value of the books, for even considered only as
specimens of Burns’ penmanship they are of con-
siderable value. Here, by the way, is a little

The blighted affections of the human inside
form an asset which It is very difficult for even a
lawyer to value. Those of Ann Eliza Coy, of Mel-
bourne, have been estimated by a jury at £lOO,
and, to all appearance, she got very good value*
Ann Eliza is a widow, aged about 50, and the man
who rent her trusting heart is a dipsomaniac
baker who has got past 60 milestones on the road
of life, and who is alleged to be subject at times to
visitations from snakes, blue devils, dogs with

“Sir Henry Parkes was entertained at a Champagne Banquet at Orange on Saturday
night. Healso attended divine service on Sunday Morning.”
nothing romantic about the proposal or the
attendant love-making. The baker had been
drinking rather freely from a brandy-flask, and he
simply thumped his charmer in the spine and
intimated he would be hanged if he did not marry
her. The matter was settled a few days later, and
the first privilege Mr. White enjoyed in his new
position as an engaged man was that of paying 7s.
in the £to the lady’s creditors. Then the baker s
daughter interposed, and told the fat enslaver that
her father had been discovered with the servant
girl on his knees, but the old gentleman repelled
the insinuation and expressed a hope that his hair,
would turn mouldy if It were true. His hair did
not turn mouldy, but on the 34th March, the day
when two fond hearts were to beat as one for tho
first time, he was too ill to undergo the ceremony.
From this moment things went wrong, and the
glow of love froze to the consistency of Ice-cream.
The baker was summoned for an unexpected dress-
making bill, and a loan of £6 which the widow
negotiated with him lay heavily on his vitals By
the 13th June all was over, and when Mrs. Coy
demanded of the hoary swain some explanation
of his faithlessness, that snow-topped deceiver
finerely said It was owing to bad counsellors and
“snakes.” Perhaps it dawned on Mrs. Coy chat
the snakes in question would be rather had com-
pany in the event of the marriage ever being con-
summated, to say nothing of the yellow dogs, ihe
striped alligators, and the rest of the fanciful,
ever-changing menagerie in the amorous baker’s
head; at all events, she dried her tears on
finding that her Intended held back, and
consoled her sorrowing heart by the issue
of a writ for £5OO. In the witnesr-box, how-
ever, the defendant said he was quite willing to
marry “the woman.” He was nearly always
drunk, but if she did not object to that, her baker
was all her oftn. But the plaintiff’s lawyer Inti-
mated that the time for such a settlement had
gone by, and Ann Eliza Coy would never again
pour forth her treasured affections at the feet of
an old snake-haunted lover, with an enlarged
liver, a husky voice, and a grown-up family- Ic
was for the jury to estimate the va l ue of what she
had lost, and the jury, after studying the ruins of
the baker, summed him up at £RO. Possibly they
knew their own business, but the estimate seems
an extravagant one, and it is not a little strange
that a colony should be so deeply In debt when it
possesseatoafcers to the value ot probably £1.000,000
scattered like an unearned increment over Its
territory*

The feeling of intense irritation which has
been aroused in Queensland through the proceed-

antagonist, but the plucky little Gaul felt that he
was maintaining the honour of his fatherland and
fought gamely to the last. Finally, being pinned
down, he fixed his teeth in bis enemy s hind leg

A prisoner at Avenel (Vic ), fell sick the

hole. We knew a man once, who, when serving a
long term in one of H.M.’s prisons, starved him-
self with the idea of eventually squeezing between

The life of a Chinese journalist is very
precarious. Wongtzl, a yellow scientific writer,
has been sentenced to lose his head because, in

emperor is dead in that country the first job is to
forget him, and anybody who attempts to call him
to mind la liable to come to grief. The system is
worth adopting in other lands, and the only pity
seems to be that people cannot forget living
potentates as well as dead ones. It is about al
they are good for. In Australia, lots of the
aristocracy quite lose their heads over mere
lords and governors. We are glad the Prince of
Wales isn’t coming.
Mr. Field Barrett, of the Australian

mously that “strict morality” is essential to
membership. In these days of so-called Christian
disclosures it is almost unaccountable that an
otherwise harmless body of young men should
seek to Introduce the element of “ strict morality”
into their midst. It can only result in an all-round
collaring of the cash and a general “bust.” Not
that the Australian Natives' Association would be
badly missed. If it attained any strength, we
should be inflicted with a counter demonstration
in the form of a New Chums’ League, or a Non-
Native Brotherhood.
The Bishop of Ballarat is supplying a long
felt want by delivering a course of lectures on the
Seven Dreams of Zichariah. For many years past
the people of Victoria have been literally howling
for information about Zachariah, and now they
are getting it. We have been Induced to look up
the subject, and we find that Zachariah went to
bed after a heavy supper of Hebrew hash, and
dreamt, among other things, that he saw a “flying
roll,” which he interpreted to be a curse—a sort of
balloon curse, as it was floating in the air—and it
is on this roll that the bishop is now expatiating.
Our own opinion is that the document in question
was the North Queensland Separation petition, but
we will wait to near the orthodox explanation be-
fore we commit either ourselves or Zachariah. The
Ballarat man with the mitre gets about JEIOCO a
year for expounding dead Jews, so, after all, the
affair is his business, not ours.
About the best free ad. on record appears
in a late issue of the Tenterfield (N.8.W.) Record.
Little Brown, of Tenterfield, son of big Brown, of
the same town, is home from school for a little
recreation, and has brought with him bis copy-
book, a map of Australia, and a drawing of some
cats. These productions have been exhibited ty
the fond parent to the editor of the local journal,
and that gentleman devotes a good-sized local to
the subject. Young Brown will now swell round
that small settlement in the character of a youth
of “culchab,” and will probably develope as one
of the best prigs in the back-blocks. We have
seen several youths do the same on much hss pro-
vocation, aud nothing but a course of judicious
and carefully-assorted caning, together with a
little exercise at chopping the family firewood on
cold mornings, saved them from acquiring artistic
tastes which might have lasted for the remainder
of their lives.
The Sydney D.T. editorially asserts that—
“ Speaking in a general way, we should siy that
more uncompromising rectitude is shown by get-
ting up and leaving the church (before the ser-
mon), while the time-hallowed ecclesiastical con-
ventionalities are best preserved by maintaining
your seat and quietly slumbering there,” Arguing
on the same premises, the evident deduction is
that the apex of rectitude would consist in the
negative virtue of not going to church at all.
A yarn from the land of the Darling.
Dwellers in that region of goats, rum, and kerosene
tins, butchers, bakers, yea, even editors, and not
even forgetting solicitors, have their periodical
fits of painting the town red. During one of these
periodical freaks of local industry an enterprising
resident hit upon the truly original and touchingly
beautiful thought that he had once upon a time
owned a cheeyild I His long-lost cheejild I and he
pined to caress it again. So he clutched his little
spade, laid in an assortment of red rum and white
pookethandkerehiefs, hied him to the cemetery
and paddocked round for children. He prospected
a grave, put a shaft down, and panned up the re-
mains of some other man’s child. Then the owner
of that other sepulchre appeared on the scene and
remonstrated with a brick.
Something is going wrong with the calcu-
lations of the Tory prophets with regard to Ire-
land. Instead of the brutal Catholic desolating
Ulster, it seems to be the frantic Orangeman who
is shedding fractured skulls over that part of the
habitable globe. On the 4th June, 3000 Protestant
workmen attacked 100 Catholics employed at the
docks, and after savagely assailing them, drove
them into the water, where one was drowned.
Another “ religious ” item comes from Auckland.
A man named Caffrey, the master of a trading
cutter, the Sovereign of the Seas, shot Robert
Taylor and then put to sea. He was soon pur-
sued, and the usuai long stern chase is now taking
place. The cause of the deed was that Taylor
broke off his daughter’s engagement with Caffrey
some time ago on account of the latter being a
Catholic. Rum and religion promise to keep the
police busy, but at the present moment religion ift
ahead.

Holt’s Madness.
Edward Brown Holt, who passed lately
from a bank-manager’s parlour to a cell in Parra-
matta gaol, is reported to have gone out of his
mind. An official investigation into the matter is
now being made. It may be remembered that
the first year of Holt’s imprisonment was to
have been spent in solitary confinement, and
although he was not removed to Berrima, where
this class of punishment is usually inflicted, the
public were informed that he was to duly undergo
It in Parramatta gaol. Whether or not he be
actually mad, and whether, if mad, the Insanity
has anything to do with the punishment he re-
ceived, we do not at present eaqulre. But we ask
what was the use of giving a man like Holt 12
months’ solitary confinement ? What was the use
of giving him any solitary confinement at all?
Steady work would appear to have been the
fitting thing for his condition of body. Steady
work would also have been the healthiest
occupation for his mind. The worst use to which
a man can be turned is to hang him. The next
bad use to make of him is to condemn him to com-
pulsory idleness of mind and body. Tne cost of
our prison establishments is very great. Last
year the labour of prisoners in N.S.W. amounted
to only £40,000. Out of 2563 prisoners only 1842
were employed. In New York, out of 3000 con-
victs, only 400 were unemployed. Two years ago
the prisons of New Vork were self-supporting,
and were it not for certain false Democratic
notions seizing on the Legislature they still would
be so. After deducting tne earnings from the ex-
penditure in San Quentin, each prisoner is found
to cost the State cents per day.
mm*
When a man breaks the law enlightened
satisfaction is obtained by making him yield
compensation. If ho steals money from the
community his four or five years in prison
should obviously ho years of work. Prison dis-
cipline is, however, crammed with fads. As the
disciplinarians are mostly able men their fads
are the more dangerous. They turn them into
fixed principles, and bring every kind of subject
under them. Hence they make the community
whom a culprit defrauds support that culprit
while he sits idle with his arms crossed in a cell.
Nor is the time he sits thus the only loss. About
every fortnight he has to be doctored up with
stimulants. When he gets strong enough he Is
sent back to sit idle with his arms crossed for
another term. That is called discipline. Econo-
mically, it ia vicious. Personally, as regards the
prisoner, it is, administered thus, often calamit-
ous. There a man like Holt sits in his white-
washed cell. No sound reaches through the thick
stone walls He has no space to walk about.
There is no work for him to do. There is neither
book nor paper to read. A pitcher of water
stands beside him. All the food he gets per
day is 16oz. of bread. Daylight crawls along. He
sits there staring. Night comes slowly down. Ha
sits there staring. Once m 24 hours he is taken
out. He hears an order which he interprets to
mean that he la to draw a canvas bag over his head.
The bag falls down to his shoulder. Small aper-
tures exist for seeing and breathing. Lo, he
marches—Holt marches—up and down, up and
down, or round and round—a ghastly speetacle of
what gaol faddists can make ofamanl What is
the use. we ask again, of turning a man into this
raree «how for nobody to see? Would it not be
better for him, for us, for all, if he were kept at
good, hard, steady work ?
m * *
We are not here arguing for the complete
abolition of solitary confinement. In some cases
it may be of service. The Quakers, who were the
first to introduce it as a fixed element in prison
discipline, demonstrated its advantages. But they
set themselves, in their American settlements, to
observe its influences, and soon invented qualifi-
cations. There are violent and unruly minds that,
thrown back on themselves, may be able to recog-
nise in the silence of the cell that their existence
is running on false lines. Mr. Justice Williams, of
Victoria, defends solitary confinement on the score
of its salutary effects on hardened criminals. Holt
was not, at any rate in the disciplinary sense of the
term, a hardened criminal. But even with har-
dened criminals there should be no rule of fad.
The antecedents of the men should be taken into
account and the effects of the discipline on them
carefully noted. When, not long ago, certain
borough councils were granted prison labour, the
prison officials made a lengthened study of the
antecedents and temperament of every convict
they let out to work. Why not show equal care
for a prisoner on his way to the silent cell ? A
hardened criminal, constitutionally lawless and
hostile to society, is not so very certain
to grow better by being forced to look in
upon himself for 30 days out of every 60,
or six months out of 12. That much is ad-
mitted on all hands. One may improve, hut
another may be liable to people the vacuity about
Mm with wild faces like his own; the silence about
him he is liable to fill with cries of desperation
and revenge. There can be little doubt that pre-
disposing causes to insanity are thus supplied.
There can be no doubt that if there be latent in-
sanity in the system, this sort of punishment de-
velopes it. While, then, admitting that, under
careful administration, solitary confinement may,
in certain oases, be employed with advantage, we
can discover no motive beyond a senseless attach-
ment to a routine of fad in committing Holt to
the silent cell. Give the man work, but in the
name of humanity, do not wantonly drive him
mad.
BY FLOOD AND FIELD.
Tall scoring was the order of the day on
Saturday in the Sydney football field. For the Gar-
diner Cup, the Goidons romped over theßedferns
on the Agricultural Ground scoring, by 28 points
to nil; and the University team beat Newtown on
the latter’s ground by 19 to nil. On the Association
irrouiid] which was open for the first time this
season for inter-club matches, the Burwoods
knocked pieces off the Arfomas by 15 points to 6,
the feature of the game being the admirable place
kicking of Harris, of Burwood. Among the
Juniors, the Double Bays were on the warpath
again, and "did” Randwickby 4 points to nil; the
Larett-s beat the Manlys, and the Cammerays
were jubilant over the ttnshing they gave the
Harrowgates.

Champion Foley and Newton’s combina-

In the boxing art may be looked forward to in the
series of entertaiments to come off in Foley’s
Hall, commencing next Saturday. The opening
night will icclude a set-to between the clever
Peter Newtoa and Lees, who recently de-
feated Pdrnan, and is said to be a much-
better man than when he last boxed before the
Sydney public. Several other good bouts are set

the eld war-horse, sniffs the battle in the distance,

We cannot compliment the Melbourne
Cricket Club upon its grab-all policy in competing
against Shaw and Lilly white la the bringing out
of an English team to the colonies next season.
It was an open secret that the two English pro-
fessionals had such an objeci in view, and, eon-
side ring the shabby way they were treated by the
Australian Eleven during thsir last venture, it
would only he a fair thing to give them a show in
a future attempt. No better or fairer sportsman
than Lillywhite exists, and it is to be hoped the
M.C.C. may reconsider their decision, more espe-
cially as overtures had already been made to some
of the leading players by Shaw and Company.
mm*
Colonial cricketers, as a body, admit that
our excellence in the game was mainly brought
about by the visits of the earlier Bngllsn Elevens,
but let a colonist even hint to a fair-piay-lovmg
Britisher that we have repaid the favour by what
we Australians have shown them in our trips to
the oid country, and he stands a fair show of
being wolfed without salt. Who has not noticed
the listless lazing feeling of professionals of old
compared with their brethren of the latter days ?
They used to remind us of old Charley Laurence’s
blacks, who, when they took a wicket, squatted on
the field until Charles set them going again with
his foot. How the old boys who used to he com-
pletely nonplussed by slow Googlers, with the
least bit of stuff in them, must open their eyes
when they see Joey Palmer or Tom Garrett put in
a real fast one with a three or four inch work on
it. Before the advent of our boys in England,
Jem Lillywhite and old Sotherton, with their
sugar doodles, were the bosses of their day, but
neither of them would get a wicket now in a
month of Sundays. Let us hope to hear no more
of the cant, when we again drub the Britisher,
that he taught us all we know. The account is
squared.

The principal event on the recently issued
programme of the Sydney Bicycle Club annual
meeting is the 10 miles’ championship, which was
carried off last year by C. R. Wood. This year
Wood will have to win it on his merits. If he wins
it at all, as hia opponents will in all probability in-
clude Con Dwyer, the present champion at most
cistancr-s; F. H. Shackleford, the late champion,
who has been taking a rest, and ia going into train
log for the event; Busst; “ English” Brown, and
other good riders from Melbourne; Tregonning,
the Adelaide champion; Langdown, the Maori-
lander, who ia reported to have done some wonder-
ful times on inferior tracks on a 60-lnch machine;
and Tasmania and Brisbane will also bo repre-
santed. In addition to this race there is a mile
scratch invitation race, and the Mlllbrook Chal-
lenge Cup, two miles, and, aa these are three
representative distances, the winner of the best
two may be looked upon as the amateur champion
of Australia.

The Sydney B.C. have received a big
knock, however, in the fact that the Sydney
Lancers have fixed upon the same day, 14th
August, for their athletic meeting, and as their
intrepid Colonel has serious intentions, we under
stand, of competing in the tent-pegging, and per-
haps a couple of other events, the S. B.C. may bid
good-bye to the Bong Tongers, who are sure to
rally round the gubernatorial Colonel and his
gallant “ Lancahs.” It is a pity the Lancers and
“ bike ” men cannot come to an understanding
with a view to a postponement on one side or the
other.

tution, and the place was again packed on
Saturday night. A wrestling match was on the
card, but it found smill favour with the audience,
who thought it slow work to see a man of Con-
nor’s calibre playing with a couple of men whom
he could have eaten in the time he allowed him-
self to throw them four times. Should Muldoon,
Acton, or other of the American wrestlers come
out, the Sydney public might acquire a taste for
the sport, but it would hardly be safe to try a
repetition of Connor’s show. The box of the night
was between Kelly and Fuller, who fought them-
selves to a standstill in four rounds. Kelly is a
determined, good-tempered boxer, whom we fancy
will develope into a good man should he improve
his infighting, which at present is wild and uncer-
tain. Pablo Frank and M'Carty made a poor show
of the plenty-action little-execution kind. Dooley
and Fogarty were billed for four rounds, the for-
mer undertaking to knock his opponent ou f , but
Fogarty did not put in an appearance, though the
doughty Michael was on the spot and eager for
the fray.

The following is the latest phase of the
John L. Sullivan-Jem Smith affair, as given by a
Yankee paper:—“lf the plans which have been
laid, and which the American champion is a party
to, are successfully carried out, John L. Sullivan
will fight James Smith, the British champion, in
England, inside of three months. The men are
anxious to meet. During his career, Sullivan has
made many influential friends, men who taka
great interest ia prize-fighting, but who do not
wish to figure in connection with an affair of the
ring. Among these, it is said, is Albert Edward,
Prince of Wales. Two weeks ago three prominent
friends of the American champion sent a com-
munication to the Prince asking his intervention
in order that the men might fight without danger
of interference. Sullivan’s proposition is that he
shall go to England provided it can be guaranteed
that he can meet Smith in a private room with
only 20 spectators, the stakes to be 10,000 dollars
aside. It is intended that five of the spectators
shall be Americans. The expectation is that the
Prince of Wales will affix his seal to the letter,
thus insuring fair play, and it is even believed that
he will be one of the spectators.” By the way,
John L. is once mere reported to have entered
into an engagement to visit Australia, this time
under the management of Frank Lane, late a
member of John T. Raymond’s theatrical com-
pany. This rumour will, doubtless, turn out to be
no nearer the truth than those previously cir-
culated.

The erstwhile crack, Malua, has joined the
noble army of benedicts. He has gone to the stud.
The Australians have not done badly so
far in the English tour, as the following statistics
will show. Of the 14 matches contested they have
won slx-against Oxford University, Gentlemen
of England, Derbyshire, Lancashire, Middlesex,
and Lord March’s team ; been beaten twice, by
Lord Sheffield’s team and Surrey ; and have played
six drawn games with Nottingham, North of Eng-
land, Cambridge University, Gentlemen of Eng-
land, the Players, and C. J. Thornton’s team :
For a year or more'Australian ’cyclists
have smiled a superior smile when told how Dan
Canary can climb on his bicycle in 75 different
ways. You can't stuff a Sydney youth who rides a
bicycle. No, sir! And when he reads about Dan
riding on the big wheel alone, he slowly closes
one eye as Indicative of unbelief. But a greater
than Dan is even now in our midst, and our head
is spinning yet from watching his superb dex-
terity. W. 8. Maltby’s preliminary exhibition at
Botany proved that notone of the wildly impro-
bable feats credited to Canary and Kaufman is
impossible, for he did them all before our eyes in
Smith’s historic pavilion. Booth and Kingsley
were small apples to him. Lightly running
out his gleaming Rudge—a 48 inch, all-mckle
machine-he vaulted into the saddle, and
with arms folded on his chest, careered from
side to side with a wavy motion. Then, with-
out touching the handles, he slowed up and
stood motionless the wheals at an angle; next,
with a sudden jerk, he reversed the wheels to the
opposite angle. Throwing both legs over the
front he propelled the machine by the rim of the
wheel. He rode it in front of the handles, and
then turning round with face to rear he rode it
backwards. Crouching down on the small wheel,
he rode with the propelling leg inserted between
the large wheel and the backbone. In the ordi-
nary position he w?nt twice round the building,
with the small wheel sticking in the air behind,
like a new and enlarged kind of “ improver;”
then did the same backwards. He waltzed the
Rudge gracefully, and hejspun it round like a tee-
totum. He stood upright on the saddle, with one
foot on the handlebar. He lowered himself down
by the side of the machine and rode sitting on
one pedal. He threw down a handkerchief,
rode to if, stopped, picked it up, and
went on. Climbing down the spoke, he
laid the bicycle on its side, then turned it upside
down, mounted the pedals, pulled the machine up
from under him, and rode away. Up to this point
he had never touched the ground since first
mounting. Now, unscrewing the head and de-
taching the backbone with its little wheel, he
mounted from the pedals and rode the large wheel
alone with fork and handles, then let go the
handles and rode without them. Next, betook
the fork and handles off, mounted tne wheel,
which was now divested of everything but pedals,
and guided it round with his hands on the rim.
Finally, lifting hands off, he rode without them.
Maltby’s show was a revelation to Sydney cyclists,
and it may furthermore be now announced that
Maltby dresses in black velvet tights, and that he
is so young that he hasn’t started whiskers yet.

A suit for £2OOO damages has been insti-
tuted against the Chicago Nhws by Charley
Mitchell, the English pugilist. Recently J. J.
M’Carthy, a county commissioner, sued that paper
for libel for saying that he had mistaken his call-
ing and should have been a pugilist, and intimat-
ing that whenever he had a mill In a saloon some
one was robbed. M’Carthy was very angry at this,
and wanted to know the author of such a state-
ment, and the paper, a few days ago, in an
editorial. Ironically stated that Charles Mitchell
was the authority for the statement, and Charles
is now going bald-headed for repair of his dam-
aged reputation.

Mitchell and Burke met in another of
their “draws” at Chicago on May 10, whensooo
people exchanged their dollars for a clever exhi-
bition of boxing. Matters were pretty even until
the ninth round, when Mitchell forced the lighting
from the start and landed blow after blow on
Burke’s ribs and face. Burke also got in several
hits but they were Jlght. Mitchell was strong in
the tenth round and Burke was knocked against
the ropes at the very start. From that time on
Mitchell forced his opponent all over the ring.
Towards the end he got in a savage blow on
Burke’s face. The police then Intervened, and the
exhibition was stopped, the referee deciding it a
draw, although the audience howled its disap-
proval.

The It st of the races, one mile, between

George, came off at Madison-square Garden, New
York, on May 15, George went away with the
lead, and held it until the last turn was reached,
when running round the Englishman, Myers drew
level. Then ensued one of the most exciting
struggle? ever seen. Both men turned on all
steam, running at top speed, shoulder to shoulder,
until 25 yards from the goal, when the American’s
phenomenal speed carried him to the fore, and
George's last desperate effort failing, Myers
landed the event by about sft. The time was
4min. 32 2-sseo .At a banquet tendered to the win-
ner, Myers, in reply to a toast dubbing him

The eccentricities of amateur jookeyship
provoked a scene at the last Caulfield Y.A.T.O.
meeting. There were four starters far the Vic-
toria Gold Cup, a two-mile steeplechase—gentle-
men riders. Slight odds were laid on Blackthorn
(ridden by Mr. W. Glasscock), 8 to 1 was taken
about Roulette (owner up), and at the last moment
some money was put &n the very moderate Fickle
(owned by Mr. G. Glasscock, and ridden by Mr. O.
Glasscock). The fourth horse was unmentioned
and unnoticed. On form the race was a match
between Blackthorn and Roulette, and so it
proved, until—by a most singular mischance, con-
sidering the experience of Uis rider—Blackthorn
galloped past the gap leading into the straight run
home, carrying Roulette with him. The latter’s
rider appeared quite innocent of the mistake he
had made until Mr. W. Glasscock suddenly turned
round and made for the right course. Meanwhile
the other Mr. Glasscock, on another Mr. Glass-
cock’s Fickle, had taken the proper turn and was
making steadily for home. His brother brought
the favourite up hand over hand, but alasl Fickle
just won by a length. As for Roulette, he had been
put quite out of it by Blackthorn’s little mistake.
A hurricane of bootings greeted the brothers
Glasscock on returning to scale. The “demon-
stration” was mainly confined to the people on the
fiat, while the upper ten maintained an ominous
silence. An attempt to get up a counter-cheer
failed. Perhaps the outsiders were rash in jump-
ing to sinister conclusions. . Perhaps they attached
too much importance to the fact that Mr. W. G.
turned in his saddle when he was making the last
bend for home and carefully surveyed the position
of the field. Taken in conjunction with his sub-
sequent little mistake that minute survey was
somewhat unfortunate. The reporters of the
dairies are discreetly silent about it.
Even Sir Henry Parkes cannot resist the
prevailing infection. The Freetraders mu st argue
from facts, and as the facts, such as they desire,
are not obtainable, they, with the aid of brilliant
imagination, succeed In evolving them. Sir Henry
has, therefore, only followed the traditions of his
party In stating that " the coachmakers of N.S.W.
have beaten the American buggy-makers out of
the colony.” This Is a magnificent Preetrade
“fact,” but is no more reliable than the Kiama
ghost for all that. The truth is that N.S.W.
buggies are, on the average, far inferior to those
of Victoria, and still more inferior to the American
importations. So far Is this inferiority acknow-
ledged, that the few local manufacturers report
great depression in their trade at the present
time, induced by the excessive importations. This
is a specimen of “ Freetrade fact.”
One of the most fashionable of Australian
fads is the burial-ground fad. They have it worst,
perhaps, in Melbourne. The same people who
stroll complacently along by the side of foul,
open, drains have many sanitary misgivings about
living near graveyards. To the Londoner, accus-
tomed to see hundreds of tombstones, packed as
close as herrings, in the very busiest parts of the
metropolis, this Melbourne dread of the dead
must appear somewhat eccentric. When tne Vic-
torian Government granted permission for Arch-
bishop Goold to be put away in the vault of the
Roman Catholic Cathedral, people spoke sadly of
dangerous precedents and possible pestilences.
Great Scott I the English authorities have been
dropping corpses underneath old Westminster
Abbey, in a densely-populated locality, for cen-
turies past. Round about Bow Church, the
Mansion House, and the Guild Hall, there are
dozens of narrow streets containing sites of
churches, past and present. Each of these
churches did have, or still has, a little yard
attached to it, and every yard has received its full
complement of dear departed ones. When a
church gets very much in the way, it is
de-oonsecrated (a very touching ceremony I)
and pulled down. Then a magnificent monu-
ment is erected to the nameless dead ’uns
who slumber thereabouts in the shape of a
red brick six-storey warehouse. But all this reck-
less indifference to the abiding places of their
ancestors doesn’t prevent Londoners from enjoy-
ing a very healthy death-rate. What human
being stands a better chance of turning the cen-
tury than a placid Grosvener-square dowager?
Longevity is one of the privileges of an existence
in that favoured spot, flowing with milk and
money. Statistics might be quoted to prove the
statement. Yet, listen to this—Grosvenor-square
and Grosvenor-place are built on the very fields
wherein were deposited the victims of the great
plague of London I Tens of thousands of bones
are rotting in plague-pits under Jolly old family
mansions. And what has been the result ? Largely
increased ground-rents have followed on this en-
richment of the soil. The Melbourne outcry
against the sanitary condition of graveyards has
little foundation in fact. So little, Indeed, that we
are inclined to fancy that many occupants of the
local cemeteries are now occupying the healthiest
homes they ever had in their lives.

Fijian Christianity.
The latest " Christian” murder committed m
Fiji says vary lit'le for th s tvnooss of missionaiy
enterprise in that group The difference between
the modern Bib'e assassination and the old-
fashioned heathen homicide, we may explain, is
that the convertei nigger tells lies afterwards,
and says he did not do it, while his unconverted
progenitor used to mash up his enemy as a matter
of business, and then return in triumph, and
point out to his friends the marks on the
chief end of his club, as something to he
proud of. Lately II men who were fondly eup-
P'im ? d to be shining lights in the soantily-claci
native church conspired against their chief, a so a
pet lamb in the mission flock, and by means oi
wrath and violence, combined with knobby sticks,
treachery, and hard bumping, they feloniously
converted the said lamb into mutton. their
tri il it appeared, the Ordinary P jian religion is a
kind of spiritual shandygaff, consisting of cm
part Bible and two parts fetish and timber-god,
and to the latter, wo presume, the crime maybe
ascibcd. The Pdyncsians attend church in the
morning, and how down to their own sandal wood
deity in the afternoon, their devotion to the latter
being much the more reliable sentiment of the
two. The eleven murderers of Bull Bureia.
the missionary merino already aUuded to,
wore led by a sorcerer, in whose power they
sem to have placed Implicit faith, and
whom they dared not disobey. These rr vo-
litions open an unexpected prospect for gen-
tlemen of the white-choker fraternity whe
may be disengaged and on the outlook for a
stony field of labour, for there is evidently still
much room for the use of evangelical dynamite
jn blasting out the rocky superstitions which ft ran
the foundation of Fijian religion. Most people of
Australia fondly Imagined that the wooden ged
had long sicca been split into post and rail fences,
and that the sorcerer of past times now passed the
plate and gathered intheoocoanuts of thefaithfu',
while the ex-cannibals of the congregation sang
gemekird of naked dcxology, hut these latest
revelations have altogether spoiled this cheerlul
theory, and apparently we must raise another
scrlption for the souls of the heathen, and start
1 he whole sacred j sh afresh.

The “ Woman in White,” at Sydney Opera
House, is a decided success, but its many devia-
tions from the text show that the usual difficulty
has been experienced In turning a splendid novel
into a good drama. The existence of this difficulty
of course implies no censure on the playwright,
for the most brilliant writers for the stage oaten
find themselves heavi'y handicapped when they
essay to compress a lunatic-originally lisued in
three volumes—into the compass of four parts,
with a preliminary yell through a vestry window.
Even our friend George’s brilliant attempt to
turn Paul’s Epistle to tne Ephesians into an Aus-
tralian bush-drama, by inserting a gang of coiners
and a runaway bullock-dray, met with a very
limited success, and yet the abilities of George
and of Paul as apostles and comedians are un-
doubtedly of a very high order. The “ Woman in
White ” is announced, however, as the joint pro-
duction of Wilkie Collins and Wybert Reeve, and
posslblva few ot its inequalities may bo due to
the d ffarenca in style of the two authors The
position of a ooliaborateur la a thankless one at
the best, but the difficulties of joint authorship
are often lessened by allowing the bigger man of
the pair to write the leading parte, while the other
composts the dialogue for the character whose
dead body ii found lying in the middle of the
stage when the curtain rises for the limit act. As
this individual does not generally say much, any
divergeaots in the manner of writing are thus
rendered almost imperceptible.
* ♦ *
Very few are unacquainted with the story
of the “ Woman in White.” The drama, however,
is constructed by mangling up the original tale
with a circular saw, and then piecing together the
amputated fragments of the characters until they
become at times almost unrecognisable. Anne
Catherlck appears in the first scene nursing a
Russia-leather pocket-book, which Sir Percival
Glyde takes from her and flings into Woolioo-
mooloo Bay. He then burglarises the parish church,
and, alter the fashion of most stage villains, he
tells the tale of bis debts and bis wickedness to a
table and two hard-bottomed chairs, while the
window above his head yawns at the recital until
It threatens to dislocate the lower jaw of the sash.
Walter Hartwrlght sits on a damp tombstone out-
side while these events are in progress. Count
Fosoo appears later on and takes Anne Cathe-
rlck to his motherly bosom, which is almost
as capacious as tint of Abraham. The wily
Italian is dressed in the patriot flig of the
Southern States, cut bias and trimmed with
unfathomable wickedness, and he leads Sir Per-
cival Glyde on to murder and abduction and em-
bezzlement and other acts of discourtesy which
are highly reprehensible To right-minded men.
therefore, the Count is a disappointment. Con-
sidering the influence he exercises over the
baronet, he might be expected to heave that in-
dividual right over the jasper fence into Paradise,
but, instead, he turns the coat-tail ot scorn on his
better self, and drags his companion to a watery
grave. Maiion Haleombe, the sister of Lady
Glyde, stands nobly forward to protect that perse-
cuted lady, but considering the men she has to
deal with, it would have been more to the point if
she had chased them with an axe into the neigh-
bouring hills. Waiter Hartwrlght, a virtuous
drawing-master, aids her in this good work, but he
is not of much value. We have met with men of
bis profession whose abilities were such that they
eould draw anything Irom a crowded house to a
cat’s-meat cart, but Walter can do neither. Retri-
bution, however, descends on the Count from an
unexpected quarter; avenging Fate throws a
half brick at him in the last act, and he sleeps
With his fathers under the Shadow of a
packing-case la a furnished house in St. John’s
Wood. He is cool and collected, however, to the
last, and even when mortally wounded he looks
carefully around till he finds a favourable spot on
the dusty carpet where he can lie down and
shuffle off this mortal coil la peace. He had such
difficulty in discovering a soft place that we half
expected at one time he would be reduced to die
up against the wall, or to perish standing erect
amidst the Japanese brlo-a-brac, but this sacrifice
of human dignity was fortunately averted.
* * *
Wybert Reeve gives a splendid rendering of
Fosoo, and the only fault that can be found is that
he does not die soon enough. The audience watch
his portly figure in the last act as he goes out to
“shoo” a tom-cat off the back fence, and when
they hear two shots fired they naturally conclude
that he has hopped this terrestrial twig, and will
be seen no more. But after the rest of the charac-
ters have gathered together and conversed for a
short time on various important subjects, the
Count unexpectedly rises in the east, and, hanging
on to an onion-net in the doorway, looks around
with the saddened air of a man who has just
missed his tram. Then he comes in slowly,
takes a formal leave of his friends one by one,
and sits down dead on the Kidderminster carpet
to wait for the arrival of the undertaker. A little
more agility in dying would make Mr. Reeve’s
rendering as complete as could be desired. Miss
Myra Kemble, in the double character of Anne
Catherlck and Laura Glyde, was almost faultless,
and in the very first act her back hair took the audi-
ence by storm. Mr. Brian Darley, as Sir Percival
Glyde, showed that he possesses considerable
auallfloations for being a villain, and we would
only remind him that It is better to be a successful
villain than an unsuccessful Saint. We have tried
both and we know. Miss Emily Fitzroy presented
too many personal attractions to answer the
novelist’s description of Marion Halcomb, but she
was one of the most attractive features in the
performance; and when we mention, in conclusion,
that Mr. Hoyt wore a pair of light trousers, our
notice of the drama is tolerably complete.
•* * *
The name of Hugo’s Buffalo Minstrels,
now playing at the Sydney Princess’s, is one which
recalls the mind to happy memories of a vanished
childhood. We wiped our eyes with the tail of the
programme as we thought of that long-past era
when we were accustomed to read Fenimore
Cooper and others of that ilk, and when our
greatest ambition was to be a Buffalo Bill or a
Noble Savage, or a Deerslater, and hunt the
bounding alligator or the ferocious boojum on the
prairies of America. Hugo s buffalo, however, is
a peaceful animal, and its horn is reserved strictly
for musical purposes. It is difficult to distinguish,
indeed, between the buffalo and the buffalo-
hunters but we remember, in the penny novels of
our youth, that the latter used to paint very ex-
tensively, and were spotted with all sorts of
colours Perhaps this torma the criterion on the
stage as well as in the wilderness.
• • •
The performance at the Princess is a con-
siderable improvement on the ordinary mil of
minstrel entertainments. The jokes ot the two
downtrodden Ethiopians who wield the bones and
the banjo had a certain charm, for they were all
either much older or much newer than the average.
The most ancient dated from the time when David
was editing the Psalms, but it was well received all
the same. The dancing, too, was a good feature.
Mr. Hugo apparently knows the popularity
of human logs In such an entertainment,
and all the rhyme and melody which can
be extracted from 22 of them is made tolerably
conspicuous. Fred Garnett, the contortionist,
however, is the greatest favourite with the
audience, and his performance leads us to think
the lobster must be a nobler animal than Is gener-
ally supposed, when a man who approaches so
nearly to its boneless condition evokes such unani-
mous applause. From our position it was difficult
at times to follow bis antics, but so far as we could
see, he crawled twice down his own throat, head
foremost, and came, out again at the back of his
neck, and then varie'd the amusement by bringing
his feet over the top of his hair and tying bis legs
in a knot to take the place of a cravat. He also
walked on his spare rib and on other parts of his
anatomy, which were never meant to be walked
upon, and in other ways he showed a degree of
elasticity which more than equals that exhibited
by a tom-cat when a friend endeavours to extract
him from an ash-barrel by the tall.
* * *
The attendance was the best we have seen
at the Princess for a considerable time, and that
wilderness, which has so longjbeen irrigated with
free passes only to bring forth a scanty crop of
deadheads, now promises to blossom once more.
But we cannot help thinking the public will one
day grow tired of Ethiopians and long for a
change. Even the patient Moses, after 30 years ia
the wilderness, grew weary of manna, and when he
studied the menu at dinner one day he was over-
heard to say something to Aaron which sounded
like “ D—n that hash.’ For this reason we would
suggest as a startling novelty the introduction of
a Cnlnese bones or some auoh variation, as a
change on the unvarying diet of hashed nigger
which has been so long endured by this long-
suffering generation.

The Stofel family still hold the stage of
Sydney Royal. John and his daughter mingle
their laughter and tears, and the audience follows
their adventures with sympathy. The only stick—
if a sedate and stately lady will permit such a term
to be applied to her—ln the Dutchman’s household
is Mias Watt-Tanner’s Susan Stofel. Susan Is
John’s second wife and Lizzie’s stepmother. It is
Intelligible that she may feel herself at some little
distance from the heart of the domestic life. It is
not, though, her duty to accept total exclusion.
Susan alts an apathetic onlooker while father and
daugater are interesting one another. Were she
only a visitor she would manifest more com-
munity of sentiment. Mies Watt-Tanner’s affected
isolation and frigid reserve are, perhaps, intended
to enhance, by contrast, the vivacity of Miss
Maggie Moore; but, if so, it is not good art which
destroys the natural life of one character to secure
all eyes for another.
* * *
Possibly, also, an attempt to pourtray a
not uncommon type of step-mother has some-
thing to do with It. But the Stofel household was
not the place for this class of person. It is too
often a fact that the step-mother is an incubus on
the family-circle. The grown-up young people
look askance at her. They take her to be filling
boots which, once empty, they want to stay empty
for ever. Her husband, when the family are
around, addresses her under a sense of timidity
and restraint. He is effusive enough when the
coast is clear, but when his daughter with the
bangles is present, or when his hoodlum of a boy
with a faint smell of cigarette-smoke on bis
breath is about, he behaves with diplomatic cau-
tion and prudent reserve. In time this treatment
stamps a character on a young second wife.
However frank, Ingenuous, and impulsively
affectionate she may naturally be, she Is
chilled into seclusion. The minx with the
bangles and the c'garettish hoodlum jockey
her to the outside of all family communion.
Hence she is often a stranger at her own fireside.
Externally she looks cold, because internally she
has been frozen. It la in such cases we like a
woman to call up her militant qualities. We like
to hear of her stepping boldly on to the centre of
the hearthstone some morning and Informing the
cautious diplomatist that henceforth she will be
mistress of the whole concern. It will, in the
long run, we think, be better for herself, better
for her timorous husband, and better for the
captious young people, if valorousiy she will do
this.
* ■ *
But suchastep-mothercannotbe conjured
up in the household of John Stofel. An adequate
reason for the apathetic demurenesa of Miss Watt-
Tanner s Susan can, therefore, only be found in
the author’s conception of the character.

At the Sydney Royal Standard, Rufus
Dawes and the other carefully-assorted mur-
derers who make up the convict gang promise,
like the ancient Pharaohs, to live for ever. Since
the piece was first put on the boards. Captain
Frere has died more than 20 times, but he always
comes back from—well, the exact location is his
own look-out—in time to be cut off in his flower
once more. There is a worn spot on the boards
of the stage where he comes down with a thump
every night and gives up the ghost, and a crowd
still gathers regularly to witness the performance.

It must, in justice to Mr. Alfred Dampier,
be stated that he has evidently never intended to
use for dramatic purposes the late Mr. Marcus
Ciarke's novel," His Natural Life,” without taking
into consideration the moral claim of the author's
widow to a royalty. We have evidence that Mr.
Dampier has sent Mrs. Clarke a cheque for £l3,
representing a royalty of £1 per night for the first
twelve nights ot the drama’s run In Sydney; and
we are assured that Mr. Dampier only awaits Mrs.
Clarke’s acknowledgment of the amount named to
forward another cheque of similar proportions.
Considering that Mr. Dampier is not legally bound
to pay Mrs. Clarke a single penny, we are ef
opinion that he is acting in a most honorable and
liberal manner.

Professor S. 8. Baldwin, at the Sydney
Gaiety, is doing good business among the ungodly
Sabbath-breakers. Mnsie, singing, and an elo-
quence of which the Professor has a patent, con-
stitutes the attraction. But, after all, it is mourn-
ful to behold men paying their shillings for
diversion, when, consequent upon the keenness of
competition, they can obtain salvation for next to
nothing.
* * * *
We could only find time for a hasty glance
at the Gaiety one night this week, and we found
tne Widow O'Brien in a truly distressing position.
She was suffering from an agony of sea sickness
on board the good ship Bristol, which was rolling
in a stiff breeze, and (we mention this with a
blush) she was dressed mainly in a life belt, cut
low at the neck and rather short in the skirt.
Evidently she had just sprung from her couch,
and it is a matter for congratulation that in her
haste she was not reduced to attiring herself in a
coal-scuttle or some even worse article of apparel.
This is the first occasion when we have seen an
evening-dress life-belt in use, and, considering
that the fashionable style of the present day con-
sists in the absence of so many things once re-
garded as essentials in a lady’s dress, it occurred to
ns that it mghtbe more generally adopted with
advantage. .

“ His Natural L'.fe ” (George Leiteh ver-
sion) is crowding all parts, save the magic circle,
of the Melbourne Royal. Sundry little devices
were devoted to giving this gruesome trifle a good
send-off. A mysterious somebody sought to
legally restrain the Triumvirate from producing
this great work on copyright grounds. Tbat
abortive law-suit will return a good deal more
than 60 per shent on the outlay. Then, as a special
lure for the gods, a cold-blooded police-inspector
" ran in ” the perambulation convict supers, told
off for advertising purposes. There was genius in
this last stroke, and it has earned its due reward.
Each Melbourne larrikin drops in about three
t mes a week on an average to feast upon the
horrors of Port Arthur. The convicts, in a word,
are the marrow of the show. Some clever scenes
and magnificent impossibilities of plot go for
something, but the gentlemen in yellow bring the
money; dress circle, of course, excepted. A
little circumstance, which occurred on the opening
night, may partly account for the lukewarm re-
ception accorded to “ His Natural Lire ” in this
quarter. The artless little daughter of one of
society’s brightest ornaments was looking at Gab-
bett and Co. with childlike Interest. She waited
until there was a deathly silence la the house
before enquiring: “Is that how grandpa was
dressed when he got to Sydney? ”

“A Scrap of Paper” constitutes the bill
at Melbourne Bijou. The art of manufacturing
natural complications out of nothing at all has
been brought to perfection by Victor Sardou.
“A Scrap of Paper,” even in its English garb,
strikes us as a masterpiece of ingenious audacity.
A little more all-round audacity in the Bijou com-
pany would make it go 19 to the dozen. Signora
Majeroni plays the principal part as the author
meant it to be played. Mr. H. N. Douglas repre-
sents an eccentric globe-trotter in a style which is
csrtainly unconventional, and frequently funny.
One or two of the others are fairly good, and two
or three of them are rather otherwise Perhaps
too much versatility of genius is expected from
the company. The next production is “Marie
Antoinette ” Now, between airy French comedy
and sober historical drama there is a great gulf
fixed.

Under the motto of “ refinement without

audiences as crowded as those which rally up to a

fair section of the bill. Coghlan p ere knocks saw-
dust out of the Japanese bag-pipes, an alleged
musical instrument, which is pleasant enough for
a short spell, but when prolonged becometh as
distressing as a nine-hour oration by the Padding-
ton Apollo. It is just about a fair thing, though,
to say that Mr. Coghlan does not unduly prolong
the melody. Coghlan fille does the sand-smashing

J. R. Rogers, manager for Miss Minnie

most original and effective means of advertising
his show, and has recently proved his own undeni-
able claim to the money. His last move shows
that he knows more about the art of obtaining
cheap ads. than anyone in the universe can teach
him. And he carried out the Idea so cleverly, too.
He just sat down’and wrote this bloodthirsty note
to a member of the same company“ Mr. C
Arnold.—My contempt and hate for you is such
that only death can satiate. I feel that such curs
as you are unfit to live. Name a place and time
and let us go in a room, lock the door, and only
one can come out alive to tell the tale.—Your
enemy, J. B. Rogers.” Then, of course, Mr.
Arnold, with a deep respect for the laws of the
country, rushed off and laid an information
against the gore-seeking Rogers, and special pars,
went the round of the Press, and sub-leaders on this
attempt to revive duelling in England were in half
the London papers. Then the case was called in the
police court on Monday, and an adjournment
granted till Thursday, thus leaving the matter in
suspense for three more days. On Thursday
there was no defence offered by Mr. Rogers, and
his thirst for gore having apparently evaporated,
he meekly apologised and submitted to be bound
over to keep the peace. He even by hla counsel
went so far as to say that he had no intention of
fighting a duel, and as Mr. Arnold did not feel any
animosity, the case was easily settled. This adver-
tisement by duel is a magnificent idea, but it may
be considerably overdone. Mr. Rogers would do
well to bury his “ contempt and hate ” within the
bounds of his own bosom in future.

His Story.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“ My name ?” (He was wizened and wrinkled and
grey,
And poverty-painted and old;
His dirt-armoured head on his blanket he lay,
And this Is the tale that he told)
" Well, boss,” (and he straightened his back bent
with years,
And his tangled hair waved in the breeze,
The wind whistled in through the eaves of his ears
And the splits of his pants at the knees.
His “bluey” was colled like a boarding-house
duff.
And his hilly-can stood at its side;
His jumper, worn through—the original stuff
Was cobbled with moleskin and hide.)
“ My name ” (and he drew forth a whip from the
swag,
And shook out the knots from the strands
That yet were unplaced) " Is Tommy the Lag
Then carefully spat on his bauds.
The yarn seemed to hang, so I threw him a pliig,
And his eye brightened up In a trice;
Beatitude played round the sundowner’s mug,
And his Jaws went to work like a vyoe.
Tobacco-juice trickled in drops from his chin
And fell on the hair of hla breast,
It seemed to transport him from damper and sin
To a land of ineffable rest.
1 thought it quite likely he’d chew for a week,
As he plainly took time by the year;
When, listlessly hooking the plug from his cheek
And inserting the same in bis ear.
He motioned me near, with a jerk of his head*
To a seat at the foot of the tree—
A stringy-hark, all but a branch or two dead—
It was just such a ruin as he.
I waited, expecting to hear from the “ vag.”
Some old tale of our criminal scum;
But he Just grunted out: “Yes, I’m Tommy tha
Lag—
Can you lend me a ‘ boh ’ for a rum ?”

The Girl.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We wander on from day to day,
Where rugged bills are grim and grey—
No matter where our footsteps stray
A thousand rocks impede;
Aye, followed by relentless Fate,
Whose myrmidons inveterate.
With mandates at each turn await;
As ruled the ancient Mede. ,
No matter when or where we g&ie
With tired eyes, no cheering rays
Shine through the overhanging ha2e
That all the scene enfolds;
The night comes on, the day is done;
The moments stalk past one by one,
We wonder if, beneath the sun.
The world one pleasure holds.
But when, as if some magic hand
The truant airs of summer fanned,
Bright sunshine breaks upon a land
Where brooks of crystal purl;
And, lingering where their waters flow 1 ;
A smiling wreath of flowers blow
That seems to but, you then may know
We’ve dropped aorosi the girl.
J.P.B.
The wreck of the Cahors on the Queensland
coast almost a year ago has been well nigh for-
gotten, but in recalling the subject it is hardly
needful to commence by mentioning that a sub-
scription was raised. Nobody was drowned on the
occasion in question, but money was wanted to
present a testimonial to the crew and officers of
the rescuing steamer, and as this was a mere luxury
it is quite unnecessary to say that cheques came in
freely. They always do on such occasions. The
average Anglo-Saxon citizen cannot live without
getting up subscriptions for some purpose or
other, but through a kink in his intellect his
liberality is at its brightest when organising a com-
plimentary dinner to a dog whose hind leg has
been cut off by a circular saw, and he descends to
coppers in the ease of a widow with five small
children who wants a leg of mutton for the family
dinner. Hon. Pat. Perkins was one of the ship-
wrecked company, and he took the lead in “raising
the dust.” Having been wrecked so often
before, he knew, of course, exactly what
to do. A good share went to the captain
of the Burwah, who looked on from his
vessel’s deck three miles away, while his men
did the dangerous work of taking off the Cahors’
passengers, and then the liberality stopped. It
was resolved that the rescuing crew did not
deserve to share the spoil, as they bungled and
delayed a good deal over their work, and it has
been finally decided to get rid of the balance by
dividing it among those who were save! from a
watery grave. This idea possesses all the charm
of novelty. It marks a new departure when the
reward goes to the man who is dragged out of the
water, not to the man who did the dragging.
Perkins, it is proposed, shall have a gold
medal, because he got up the subscription;
an individual named Butters has been awarded
another because he helped Perkins to make a fuss
about the affair in the papers; and a third falls to
the share of a steerage hero for his agility in get-
ting into the rescuing boat. Smaller rewards, we
suppose, will be given to the man who lay down
and howled in the lee-scuppers, and the gentlemaa
who tried to start a hymn to keep up the spirits of
the passengers. Any surplus which remains after
all these items are settled is to go to the Ly-ee-
Moon fund, which, it is devoutly to be hoped, will
not be administered on similar principles, else
Captain Webber will get the lot.
Hint for Mr. Dampier Make one of the
“ Natural Life ” convicts say that he does not care
to be hanged so early in the morning, as he feel®
the cold too much. Then the Rev. Meekin can
turn round and say, “It will be hot enough for
you presently, my man.” It is an old joke, but
would take well, and, iu the words of Alfred,
“give pleasure to all.”

Adelaide, the City of snuffle
The city of Adelaide is suffering from a rush of
morals to the head. The purified saints down
there have come to the conclusion that the poverty
and depression from which Sr nth Australia suffers
have arisen through the dissipation of unregener-
ate clerks, and have been sent as a special judg-
ment for the sirs of bank-aristocrats and over-
blown Civil servants. Good men have attempted
a reformation by peaceful means, hut all
in vain. A Vigilance Society has been formed,
and its ranks have been mainly recruited
from among the prigs, the cads, the busybodies,
the snufllirg hypocrites, the wall-eyed Pharisees,
and the bilious, greasy saints of the community.
It is backed up by the various religious organisa-
tions which recruit the gaols and practically rule
the cliy and the colony, and with their aid the
members have exacted a pledge from ihe majority
of employers to dismiss any servant whom the
Ylgllants may report to have been seen entering a
public-louse or a gambling-hell, or otherwise
doing what the saints think ircorsistent with
Christian conduct. No Vigilant need be long out
out of a billet, for he has only to hunt up the
man whose place he thinks would suit him,
get him reported, and insert himself in his
stead. Adelaide is suffering from a reign of
terror, ard hardly any clerks or warehousemen
now venture to tppear in the streets during the
evenings. Few men dare effend the meanest
skunk (we mean saint) who grerses the wheels of
this machine of monstrous tyranny, and the open
blackguards of the Vigilance Society live in a rosy
dream of free drurks, free lurches, and black-
mail, while ihe paltry coward pays eff old scores,
which he dare not openly wipe out, by reporting
the man who pulled his prying ncse in the long-
past days of childhood. It is unsafe now to go
into a hotel for tinner, as the Vlgllants at once
conclude the visitor Is tent on surreptitious
whiskies, and it is still more dangercus to greet a
lady in the street, for the saints do not know a
lady when they see her and at once set down the
case as one of wickedness and “mashing.” For-
tunately, however, the members do not find their
life one of unalloyed bliss. Now and then they
make the mistake of tackling someone whose
position makes him independent of their criti-
cism, and in such a ease the Vigilant discovers
that his lot is a sorrowful one at the best.
Several have already teen kicked down-
stairs, or at least they have been kicked
while standing at the head of a staircase, and
afterwards fell down of their own accord, which
amounts to very much the same thing both to the
kicker and ihe klekee. Others have been dropped
from windows or other high places; and a few,
while In pursuit of their avocations, have been
spanked with the cane of the ungodly, or knocked
down among congenial garbage in the gutter,
ard have afterwards taken their bruised and
miserable way homeward, singing drearily "Thy
rod and Thy staff they comfort me,” But in spite
of these acts of discourtesy, the society assidu-
ously pekes its brass-tipped nose into the haunts
of dissipation, and sniffs round after dark in the
entrance-hall of the gambling den, or the beck
yard of the hotel, trying to scent out the decaying
carcase of moral depravity. Its ranks are filled
with the brothers and cousins and other near rela-
tives of the eclipsed angels who are now breaking
stores at Dry Creek Gaol, and a good lot of the
members labour incessantly in embozzllng their
employers’ cash by day and lying away other
men’s characters by night after a hard day’s fraud
is completed. No remedy has yet been discovered
for this atrocious tyranny, and unless the citizens
of .Adelaide organise a band of Mohawks to wallop
the Vigilance Society into pulp, it is hardly likely
a cure will epee dlly be found.
Disloyal Sydney.
“York Herald,” writirg in the B.M. Herald,
complains bitterly tf the want of external loyalty
in Sydney. Among his grievances, be notes that
only one Cabinet Minister attended the review on
tbe Queen’s birthday, that the levde was a very
thin muster, tlat the members of the Government
did rot give dinners to celebrate the occasion,
that tbe city was rot illuminated—“rot even a
Brunswick Star” being visible—that the people
leave the theaties while the Natioi al Anthem is
being played, and that men do rot diff their hats
cn band-days in the gardens. “I should like,” he
says, "to see such a thing occur in Berlin or
Yienra; there all hats go <fl is If by an electric
shock, ard tbe men’who refuse would in a few
secords be interviewed by the secret police, who
are always present on such occasions.” The
author of this (ffensive piece of flunkeylsm is
seemingly desirous to see some such systemintro-
duced lito N.S.W,, and does net comprehend that
he is two centuries behind the age. Possibly he
thinks himself so small and contemptible an
animal that he should grovel before a fellow-
moital just because the latter wears “a Bruns-
wick Star,” and if so let him grovel by sll means,
but he will do little geed by asking the people of
Australia to join him. There are men who find
their true level in the sewers and in the mud,
and it is waste trouble to attempt to lift
them cut. Butitiswoith while for bare-headed
loyalists to remember that theroyalty of Britain is
only a golden calf which the people have setup,
and which they are now thinking of pulling down
again. The secret police of Berlin and Vienna
would be more profitably employed running in
German swindlers and Austrian “drunks” than
hunting up men who refuse to take off their hats
to a brass band and a national anthem, and the
Miristerial dinners, of which “York Herald”
speaks, would be given to the starving, homeless
poor rather than to rich celebrities, if loyalty
were a sentiment belonging to living humanity
instead of a mere specimen of brutal selfishness
andtoadjism. The illuminations, the feasts, the
reviews, and the whole ceremonial of the Queen’s
Birthday in England mean additional taxation and
hunger and misery to the lower classes, and the
less we have of such loyalty in Australia the
better. “ York Herald” is a poor miserable crea-
ture, as David Buchanan would say; but what a
mean Institution must be the newspaper which
allows him to waste its space 1

THE “PEERESS” AND THE SYDNEY PAPER.
The Town and Country Journal,, of Sydney,
Is the proud possessor of “ A Peeress ’’ who
writes society news fr->m London, and fh's Udy a
latest epistle Is deveted to the Prince of Wales,
the elderly German boy who fas waited so long
and ratiently for the reversion of the T mperal
bluchers. Tf e first Impression left by a p rusal of
this article is that the peeress’s name is Jtflfe les.
She takes a back-stairs view of her royal subject,
atd deals chi< fly with the Prince’s debts, his
favourites, hi- presents of diamond latchkeys, and
other topics en wb ch even anonymous peeres et
do not generally dilate, and regarding which ever
an ordinary duke would, at any rate publicly, ! ffe t
ignorance. “If the Prince is not young,” she
says, “has he not all the follies of youth?” And
then she quotes as follows:
“ There’s no botte m, r one.
In my vo’uptucusness; ycur wives, ycur
daughters,
Your matrons, and your maids cou'd not fill up
The cistern of my lust.”
The hind of peeress who drags in lines like these to
ornament her letter, we are indlm d to think was
made for the express purposeoi filling up a c stern
with a good deal of water on top of her—only
we would be sorry for the cistern. When Bob
Ingersoll said “ an honest god’s the nr blest work
of man,” he doubtless had this lady in view
and wanted partlcular’y to build up a deity
who would not be in any way responsible for
her existence. Those who would bow to a female
who thus knocks the bottom out ol Shakespesre
and drags the bard down to grovel at the feet of
Wales, would stoop to kiss the hand that washes
royai shirts, and wr uld try to preserve for a life-
time the mark of a kick received from the hootol
a Prince’s flunkey. But the peeress goes on from
bad to worse, and from worse to very worst. She

proceeds to relate tales of men who “ have seen
the Prince drive up alone in a hansom, to an im-
proper door, in an improper square, at an im-
proper hour; and whose tailor has stumbled at
dead of night upon H.R.H. lurking upon tbe
sartorial stairs—a pretty wife being, of course,
ensconced somewhere in the plebian bower.” There
is something rather “ plthian,” by-the-bye, about
the peeress s spelling—but perhaps she is an im-
ported article from A ustralia. But we decline to be-
lieve thateven theaveraice British nobleman would
relate these things to a lady, though the British
costermonger might. Yet the peeress herself ieeis
it necessary to draw the line somewhere. She in-
forms us that the prince was in the babit of giving
to his favorite ladies presents of diamond latch-
keys, and that the ladles in question wore these
gifts openly, though all knew them to be the
symbol of royal favour ; but she discreetly draws
the horse-cloth of silence over the rest of the
story, and merely wonders in cor elusion that, “in
a luxurious age, virginal marriage on both sides is
not oitener tried for the mere sake of its luxury ”
Comment must stop here. The only wonder which
Is likely to consume her readers is that a peeress
who has dived so deep into the recesses of human
depravity, and who returns from a shetl ot
familiar wickedness to d:sh up a stock ot as-
sorted stories, raked in from the borderland of
obscenity, in the columns of the Town and
Country, has not long since been kicked into
some region darker and deeper than the Yale of
Slddlm. And yet this mass of unfathomable mush
and grovel is a Sydney journal’s idea of “ society
news.” The article which contains these items
ends with an essay on loyalty, and eulogises the
prince because he is “a typical Englishman,”
and no worse than many others. The
spectacle of such a prince, propped up by
such a peeress and in such a paper, is edify-
ing. An Indian legend tells how the earth is sup-
ported by a tortoise, and the tortoise by a serpent,
while the serpent himself is supposed to dance
on his tail in thin ethereal vapour, but even the
position of the globe, precarious as it must be ac-
*2 r * in^ fo tb s theory, is emiable compared with
rwL'' f ‘ pillared by the Town and
country peeress.” And in one respect the
parallel is remarkably close, for both the barren
earth and the barren Prince are supported by
r « an<l in ea °h case the reputes seem to
fctrord a very ur certain pedestal.

“SIR GRAHAM ” FISTS FOUR OUT OF THE THIRTY PIECES OF SILVER.


Woman Items
The average servant-girl has an incurable
“ down on her ’uppers.”
Woman is not much of a philosopher, but
she is proverbially a clothes observer.
Men often boast that they are self-made ;
women never do. Modesty and false teeth and
hair often go together.
An English paper says the number of the
Fhah’s wives has been “greatly exaggerated.”
Shah I That’s what all bigamists say.
“ Never marry a woman unless she is so rich
that you would marry her if she were ugly, and so
handsome that you would marry her if she were
poor.”
Apropos of President Cleveland’s marriage
to Miss Folsom, a Yankee paper suggests thatthe
Senate should call for the documents leading up
to the lady’s appointment.
Federation is going mad. Even the iailors
are at it, and federal trousers and shirts are adver-
tised. Probably the divided skirt will next appear
under the new style of the “federated petticoat.”
The most comprehensive apology extant
is from the Adelaide Begister : “I John
M'laurin do hereby apologise for anyihirg that 1
said centernirg Miss Monk, as it was without
foundation.”
A man in Auckland, N.Z., had a wife who
ran away from him with another man. Be gave
chase, snd came up with the covple in time to
shoot at them. He shot his wife, wounding her
seriously, but missed the man. For this he may be
hanged ere of these fine mornings. His name is
Luny, and it fits him.
Bride: “ I must have your advice, doctor;
my husband gets the nightmare every night, and
frightens me to death.” Doctor: “You have gone
into housekeeping, I presume.” Bride: “Yes, we
were married last week.” Doctor: “And you
attend to the housekeeping duties yourself ? Well,
hire someone else to do the cooking.”
The Kynelon Guardian reports a wed-
ding, where out of six groomsmen not one
would venture to respond to the toast of “The
Bridesmaids.” A Miss Hookey esme to the rescue
and delivered the necessary speech. It was a pity
Nelld was not there to fill the hiatus with some
nine-hour observations about ad valorem duties.
A lady bookmaker, strangely designated
“Copper Top,” plies her vocation at Silvexton,
N.8.W., and is believed to make a good income hy
means of the pencil. Her success shows that her
“top” is neither ccpperncrwood, aid by her guile-
less smile and seductive manner she generally
succeeds in doing a large trade at tolerably short
odds. And yet there are people even now who
tay that woman is a downtrodden creature.
A cuiious charge was brought at Hay
(N.8.W.) ihe other day sgairst a Chinaman. He
was accused of concealing his wife In a brewery
with what purpose was not slated. The common-
sense of the magistrates revolted against this
ridiculous charge. If he had concealed himself In
the biewery they would have understood it. But
to conceal his wife 1 Not even a Chinaman would
ce fcolisb enough to do that-unless he had a
heathenish desire to flavour the beer with her.
He was acquitted.
The Dames of certain of the British Prim-
rose Habitations have hound themselves by reso-
lution to etchew all foreign dress fabrics and con-
fine themse Ives entirely to English materials. Thus
it is a lair contest now between politics and
fashion—Beacontfleld and Worth. We are ready
to bet cur only ticket for the next service of song
that Conservative predilections won’t influence
worth BnckhiJl’s Baby when a spring bonnet has
to be procured for cne of the aristocratic dames.
A woman’s heart may incline to primrose politics,
but her whole soul is centred round a daisy of a
bonnet.
The custom of vitiiol-throwing still remains
fashionable In France. Madame Carpentier, we
read, flung half a pint of the acid in the face of
an obnoxious concierge. He lest an eye and a
large portkn of his nose, and his mouth will re-
main a ghastly gash for the remainder ot his days.
The lady get five years’ imprisonment. They have
queer notions of justice, the se Gallic cousins of
ours. Never mind, the concierge has one eye left
wherewith to look upon la Joelle Carpentier roast-
ing before a slow fire in the Pit of Tophet If he
is permitted to haste her with kerosene they will
at last be qults.
From the Avenel correspondent ot me
Seymour (Vic ) Express “Cupid has been busy
at his mischievous tricks in and around Avenel
lately, and no less than four happy couples are ex-
pected to sacrifice themselves on the altar of
Hymen before the merry month of June has been
lost in the prismatic hues of memory.” What Is
your opinion of that now ? Is it not neat, and
elegant, and poetic? Isn’t there a sort of classic
ring about it suggesting white-robed processions
and flowers and flubs and the rest of the acces-
sories to ancient hymeneal high jinks ? And yet
the writer probably earns his living by scooting
round for kangaroo-scalps.
The latest from Ireland: —A lady, about to
dismiss her hack-car, went through the usual pan-
tomime necessary to find her pocket, it being in
the now fashionable part of her frock. As all
nautical men know, “a stern chase is a long
chase,” and the jarvey’s patience became ex-
hausted. “ Begorra,” he said, “ when your Lady-
ship’s honour has done scratching yourself, maybe
you will pay me me fare.” The foregoing story is
from that organ of the British aristocracy, Yanity
Fair, and so is this:— A well-known member of
society, who is noted for his deafness, was riding
in the Park the other <J ay on an old and favourite
mare. He was accosted hy a friend, who at first
tailed to make him hear, liaising his voice, the
friend said, “Howls your wife?” “Allright,”
was the reply; “ feel her legs, they are as fresh as
the day I got her.”
Amid the hurry and rush on the deck of
the sinking steamer Oregon, at least one brave and
noble woman came to the front. The vessel was
settling down, the men were making for the boats
In a haste that threatened to change to panic, and
the cry of “women first I” which was raised by
the officers failed to shame them into anything
like chivalry. But the whole scene was changed
in a moment when one lady stepped out from the
crowd and said she was "in no hurry,” We can
only hope George Darrell will never, never come
across that woman. All honour to her, hut we
don’t want to see her under the influence of
George’s genius transformed into the heroine of
an Australian bush-drama with a forger for a hus-
band, and then meet her again in the second act
on the deck of a burning steamer, and hear her
say she is “in no hurry” just as the treacherous
villain of the drama comes up to chuck her over-
board. George, we appeal to you as a man and a
brother to let that woman alone.
Our dear old friend and brother, J. A.
Dowie, has tsken up a new line. His faith-healing
business dropped away to nothing of late. Either
the faith or the healing wasn’t quite up to the
mark—perhaps both. Anyway, J. A. D. wanted a
new outlet lor his zeal, a iresh field for his labour.
He found it in the pub. Mrs. Dowie is toiling in
the same vineyard. She gees round to bars
Saturday nights, armed with the breastplate of
righteousness and a few tracts, and exhorts lost
ones to give up “hot scotches” and seek
only the water of life. When she arrives
at “thirdly and lastly” the landlord usually
slings her out. Boniface complains that Mrs. D.
never orders anything for herself. Put the wily
John Alexander intends to meet this difficulty in
a practical Christian way. He has warned mine
hosts that, in the future, his wife will call for such
refreshments as she may desire. She will drink
lemonade till she explodes if the Lord's work re-
quires such a gaseous self-sacnfloe. And observe
his awful threat; “In that case she and such
Christian men as may accompany her will make a
much longer stay than the brief visits they now
pay.” This is a black outlook for the trade. Two
hours of Mrs. Dowle and her Kerristlan friends
means premature decay, insanity, and death fcr
any landlord who isn’t stone deaf.
Sir Stafford Northoote—now Lord Iddes-
leigh—was always a respectable old simpleton,
and of late he has degenerated into a driveller.
We read that, in an after-dinner speech, this super-
annuated Tory said “he could confirm, with the
fullest force, the words of Mr. Isaac Disraeli,

and father ought to bean author.” Bosh I Nobody

happiness as the wretch who paints his missus

with the Are-Irons. Nobody can write a love-story
until milliners’ bills and babies have knocked all
the romance out of him, or faithfully depict a
father’s love, until he has turned his only son out
of doors. Man or woman is only capable of hand-
ling skilfully the sweet subjects of love and wed-
dings when such things have become mere reminis-
cences to him or her. Young bachelors and
spinsters throw off hysterical gush when they get
on to the love racket, and are too much up in the
clouds to discuss everyday life and commonplace
realities in a practical way. It was no giggling
virgin who created Hetty Sorrell. Thackeray and
Dickens were middle-aged fathers before they
could analyse the boyish passions of Pendennis
and David Copperfleld. The most delicate shades
of human nature are only visible to a cynical eye,
and your true cynic la the much-married man or
the matured wife. We have spoken.
Romeike, that London genius who clears
about £lO,OOO a year by supplying statesmen and
others with newspaper-cuttings, has just turned
his attention to a new line of business. A few
weeks ago he was pestering half the professional
men of London by asking them to explain why it
was they were failures. Now he proposes to open
up a lucrative occuf>atioii for the aristocratic un-
employed by establishing an Escort Supply
Agency. His plan is to keep cavaliers “on tap,’
so to speak, for use, as required. Ladies who re-
quired an escort,could then go to this establishment
and choose a cavalier, just as they would go to
llvery-'tables to hire a horse. Prices according
to appearances and ancestry. Younger sons of
peers would not be allowed to go out at less than
£5 per diem, or£l an hour. Next quality, “ super-
fines,” would be let for £3105., or 10s.; high toned
escorts, for £1 a day, or 3s. 6d, per hour, and ordi-
nary escorts for Is. 6d. an hour, with the usual large
trade discount on wholesale transactions. Decora-
tions in accordance with a fixed tariff. Escorts to
be dressed by the best West-end tailors. All fares
and tickets to be at the cost of the hirers. This
opens up an Immense field of usefulness; and
what pleases us most is that it offers a premium
to manly beauty, which now will have a tangible
monetary reward. If editors are unappreciative,
the beauteous writer will easily find more re-
munerative employment. With becoming modesty
we thank heaven that we are now independent of
the Archimedean lever of the universe.
The “ Woman’s Rights” champions in Vic-
toria are preaching certain little doctrines which
ought to “go” uncommonly well among younger
members of both sexes. A lady, for Instance,
spoke of the desirability of Edwin and Angelina
having their swim together in a quiet sort of way.
We fancy that aquatic gambols of this description
are a long-felt want. In our young days we wit-
nessed a swimming entertainment at Brill’s Baths,
Brighton (Eng.) One of the performers was a
young lady, fair to look upon and somewhat scan-
tily clad. She swam all round the bath (almost
within arm’s reach of the audience) with one leg
out of the water, and we can honestly declare that
the pleasing feat will ever remain one of our most
dearly-cherished remembrances. In those primi-
tive times the daring thought of accompanying
that young lady on her journey was quite too ad-
vanced to be entertained. But now the subject
has been fairly broached we can find courage to
say that “swims together” would be very nice.
If Angelina went through the manoeuvre just re-
ferred to, Edwin’s matutinal plunge would possess
hitherto undreamt of attractions for him. We can
answer for Edwin, and as the ladies desire the
suffrage as a means of bringing about such charm-
ing social innovations, we would like to give ’em
ten votes apiece. What candidate on the hustings
could answer “no” when a brown-eyed, slender-
waistea electress enquired if he was “ in favour of
swims together ?” Ne’er a one. And, by the way,
we also call to mind—this also occurred in our
youth—the case of a young woman who. did go in
for one of these mixed swims, In the Thames, Itr
was touched upon in a comic song of the period—
“ Mary Dixon she bathed with 300 men.'’*"'" ”
LOh, good gracious !” “
Poor Mary was “ run in” over the job. She was in
front of the age. The world was not ready for
her. In Australia, at the present moment, Miss
Dixon would be revered as an enlightened, prac-
tical advocate of 'Woman’s Rights. "
The custom of renting houses in flats is
spreading widely in England, and an enterprising
publisher, who wishes to be well ahead with the
Christmas trade, has prepared a card to meet the
times with the inscription, “ God bless our Flat.”
Rather a good specimen of narrow-minded
Christianity. The front parlour below may depart
into outer darkness, and the third floor may be
consigned to Sheol, so long as the second storey
can manage to appropriate any Divine blessing
that may be going.
A tender-hearted lawyer is generally re-
garded as a novelty, and when such an Individual
turns up he deserves a gratis advertisement.
Blanche Coulson, a young lady whose morals were
too large for her, was indicted in London in 1883
for stealing a ring from a Hindoo, and her charms
so worked upon the bar that they subscribed half-
a-crown each for her defence. Eventually she
was acquitted, and Mr. Woodgate, the tender-
hearted lawyer already mentioned, having heard
that she desired to reform and return home, gave
her his address, with an Intimation that on calling
she would receive the money for her travelling
expenses. He did not see her afterwards, but the
sum was paid on his account, and there the matter
was supposed to end. But meanwhile the be-
wigged monster who sat on the Bench had heard
of the transaction and considered it necessary to
interfere. The accusation he made was not very
clear, but in an Indignant letter on the subject he
charged the lawyer with Immoral beaevolenee
coupled with Christian charity of a kind calculated
to promote a breach of the peace, or some equally
hazy cflence, and sat upon him more heavily for
endeavouring to give a helping hand to this poor,
soiled, repentant Magdalen than he probably would
had he been the original cause other downfall. The
name of this legal luminary, we may mention, was
Peter Henry Bdlin, not Dogberry or Barabbas, as
the reader might otherwise suppose. His letter
evoked a reply, in which the facts of the case were
fully stated, and, as the judge, in his maudlin
epistle, had threatened to call the attention of the
senior member of the bar mess to Mr. Woodgate’s
conduct, he was called upon to retract and apolo«
gise for that historic document. But his Honor
then took refuge in an attitude of masterly inac-
tivity. He did not proceed to call the attention of
the Bar to the young lawyer's act of atrocious and
brutal benevolence, nor did he apologise for hav-
ng insulted him because he performed an act of
kindness which the judicial alligator on the bench
was unable to comprehend or appreciate. Finally,
after waiting three years for some kind of repara-
tion, the barrister resorted to an action for libel,
and Mr. Edlin, suddenly awaking to the fact that
he had acted under a misapprehension, ex-
pressed his regret, and retired with his forensic
tail between his legs. The importance of
this finale cannot be overrated. It has now
been established that a full-grown citizen in
England may give a penny to a blind beggar
or perform a similar act of kindness, with-
out a Judge having any right to call him bad
names on that account, unless, indeed the official
acts under a misapprehension, and should he so
act, he may be called upon to apologise at any
time within three years after the occurrence. It
also shows that a judge is not necessarily a gentle-
man, though it does not prove beyond question
that he is necessarily a hog, and it adds one more
to that long list of precedents which bristle up
like a forest of pines in that Valley of Desolation
called the English law.
Mr. Howard Vincent, who, the other day,
visited Australia with his rich wife, is now a mem-
ber of the Commons, and in opposing Sir Joseph
Pease's motion for the Abolition of Capital
Punishment, seems to have ventured upon some
remarkable statements. Hanging, he said, has
been found necessary in well-nigh every State in
every generation. Now, as a matter of fact, there
is hardly any state in Europe, save England, where
many criminals are sent to the scaffold. In France
death is still the penalty for murder in the first
degree; but the unwillingness of French juries to
convict is notorious, and very few are condemned
to death. In Prussia, again, although capital
punishment exists, and the sentence of death is
often passed, the only criminal executed in recent
years was Hodel, the man who fired at the Emperor
in 1878. The Emperor is known to have so
strong an objection to signing death-warrants,
that in passing the sentence of death the
Judges feel that they are doing no more
than recording it, and that it is certain to
be commuted. In Austria-Hungary death is the
penalty for premeditated murder; but of 816
cases in which guilty was found during the 10
years, 1870-9, only 16 were carried out. In Belgium
the penalty of death is retained ; but no execution
has taken place since the accession of the
King to the throne. In Russia the penalty of
death has been abolished for more than a century
for all cases except high treason, and the substi-
tuted punishment of the knout has been done
away with since 1863. In Denmark premeditated
murder is punished with death ; but no sentence
is considered definite until it has been confirmed
by the Supreme Court. It must then be taken
into consideration by the Council of Ministers, and
finally submitted to the King. Capital punish-
ment has not been inflicted in Denmark more than
once or twice since the year 1863. In Sweden
only one death sentence has been carried into
effect during the last 20 years. In Spain the
distinction is made between assassination and
homicide, and punishment by death, although
never abolished, has often been temporarily sus-
pended ; and the same may be said of Italy. In
the Netherlands the death penalty was abolished
many years ago. and the number of murders has
dropped to one-half. When, therefore, Mr. Vin-
cent replies that hanging is common throughout
Europe he says what he would find it difficult to
substantiate. The British races seem to like the
hanging and flogging system ; but is there after
all any evidence whatever that the hangman and
the flogger are public benefactors ? Tae idea that
hanging must be retained as an institution in Eng-
land and Australia simply involves the assertion
that British civilisation is a fraud—that the British
race is lower, meaner and more brutal than the
balance of civilised mankind.


BEWARE I
Unprincipled persons, Jealous of the success of
Warner’s safe cure, and utterly unscrupulous as
to the means employed to compass their selfish
ends, advertise in the public prints that their
nostrums will cure Kidney and Liver Diseases.
Such a result was never heard or thought of until
it was believed money might be obtained by trad-
ing on tne fair name and fame of Warner’s safe
cure. Any person of intelligence knows that Vile
Whisky Bitters will not, never has, nor ever can
cure diseased Kidneys or Liver. The raw liquor
in these cheap decoctions acts as fire on the delicate
tissus of the inflamed and congested organs, and
makes their victim infinitely worse. Yet what do
these human vultures care ? Nothing! It is ‘your
money and your life ” with them. There is but
one known specific for Kidney, Liver, and Urinary
diseases, and that is Warner’s safe cure. It has
been subjected to the most severe tests in three
continents, and incontcstibly proved to be all it is
represented by hundreds of thousands of grateful
men and women. As you value your health, shun
all vile worthless Whisky Bitters as you would so
much poison.

RATHER I
Major-General Richardson has been making
a tour of Inspection among the country volunteer
corps of N.S.W. “ He found great fault,” says a
rustic contemporary, “ with the Murrurundl corps
on the score of cleanliness.”
Why, Major-General Richardson,
We are surprised that you
For such a cause as this is should
Make such a phillaloo.
We know that, when we once explain,
You will regret, and rue it—
They wear their dirt as armour-plate,
And you can't kill them through it.

The incumbent of a church on the Blue
Mountains, N.S.W., appears to cut salvation
rather fine. He announces Bible classes for men
on Sundays at 3 p.m., for women at the same hour*
and for ladies on Wednesdays. Apparently it
would not do in that parish for the women and
the ladies to get mixed, but the present system,
commendable as it may seem to thegaifer apostle,
must have some serious disadvantages. How is it
possible, for instance, to know when a woman
ceases to be a woman and becomes a lady,
or when a lady, who is not a woman,
sinks sufficiently in the social scale to become
one ? The line, of course, must be drawn
somewhere, but between the lower ranks
of the ladies and the upper strata of the women,
there must inevitably be heartburnings and
jealousies, and then what a delicate point it must
be to effect transfers from one class to the other.
The small “storekeeperess” probably ranks merely
as a woman, but if her husband makes a lucky
speculation at Gympie or Sunny Corner she will, of
course, go up to the higher grade, and the sudden
rise may lead her to “ put on frills,” and make her-
self obnoxious* But imagine, if it be possible, the
feelings of the lady who attends as usual among
the silver-plated saints of the community on the
Wednesday after her husband has gone up Phlllip-
street as far as the Insolvency court and is re-
quested to come on Sunday Instead and take her
place with the women. Some good might be done
by establishing an intermediate class for females,
which, like purgatory, would form a half-way
station between the women who are not ladies
and the ladles who do not appear to be women*
but this would involve the episcopal doxology-
man in new difficulties. A clergyman who draws
such fine distinctions generally marks the line of
demarcation by taking off his hat to the ladies, and
merely nodding to the women, but how would
he salute the females so as to designate
their exact position ? A Christian smile might
perhaps answer the purpose, and, as there are dif-
ferent grades even among females, the smile
might be enlarged and stretched out at the
corners to any extent, provided the parson did
not turn himself outside in. We note with regret,
too, that there is no class for gentlemen at this
precious parsonage. The women’s husbands seem
to come up to the scratch sufficiently to keep a
class going for men, but the male ladles are in the
background. As for the inoumberanoe (this is a
printer’s error—wo wrote incumbent), it is not
stated whether he is himself a man or a gentle-
man. Very likely he is—only a clergyman.

A country exchange, in speaking of Lord
Carington’s Mudgee wallaby-hunting exploits, re-
marks delightedlyHis Excellency became
readily familiar with quart-pot and tin-plate,
which he manipulated like a true bushman.”
This Is a matter for national rejoicing. A lew
lines:—
One of the saddest obituary notices we
have yet seen is that which appears In the Auck-
land Herald on Edwin Balnbridge, who was
killed in the volcanic eruption at Rotorua <N.Z >
Nearly half a column is devoted to telling how he
nobly lost his life by staying to pray, instead of
either running away like the more timid, or aiding
to save others as tha braver of the residents—
both Maori and European—did; and finally the
writer sums up by saying:—“He'was a youth of
much promise thus lost to a world which j seeds
such men as he, and may need them more than
ever. A keen sportsman, a pood rider, and a devout
Christian, he has gone to the better land." Perhaps
two-thirds of this crowning eulogy might have
been omitted with advantage. Why a keen sports-
man and a good rider should necessarily fetch the
Better Land is a puzzle. Wedoat know for certain,
but it seems hardly probable th at there is much
riding up there, and tho only chance appears to ba
that Balaam’s ass may have got inside the golden
gate, and the man who wrote this obituary notice
may be going, so as to make a pair. The whole
paragraph is strikingly, like a quotation from the
speech of a Federal officer, who perorated thus in
honour of those who fell during the American
civil war: “ComradesI we think of those who laid
down their lives in this glorious cause—not dead*
but at this moment before the Great White
Throne-er-er-er galloping round like the very
devil.”

An unparalleled affront was put upon
Governor Loch at the last Caulfield meeting.
Fortunately for the dignity of the Crown, the
incident passed unnoticed, even by tho lynx eyes;
of the Melbourne reporters. Fortify us with a.
“nobbier ” of neat brandy and we will endeavour'
to explain. The Gov. drove down to the course,,
accompanied by his little son, and attended by his
hade ds kong. We love to adopt the regulation
Court Circular niceties in touching upon these*
little matters. But to resume. Sir Henry, son,-
and satellite duly made their way to the grand-
stand, and the gubernatorial drag remained in the
enclosure. Actuated, probably, by a wild spirit of
Republicanism (or colonial beer), the Governor’s 5
orderly — Heaven forgive him !—conceived the
daring scheme of mounting on top of that drag to
get a good view of the sport. Tho wretched man
was dangling his legs from the box-seat when the*
heagle heye of Sir ’Enry suddenly took in the >
situation. Our own blue orb was on the great.;
man at that awful moment. He appeared to reel .1
with suppressed passion, but by a supreme effort-
of self-command he kept his noble legs. Presently
we observed his Excellency’s bloodless lips moving
convulsively in close proximity to the agitated
ear of his official myrmidon. In the twinkling of
an eye the hade de kong was alongside of the
drag, and in another twinkling the presumptuous
orderly was on terra firma, vainly endeavouring
to hide his diminished In his helmet. What
happened to the orderly on returning to quarters
we are unable to say for certain, but there are
grounds for presuming that he was torn limb
from limb and buried at four cross roads without
military honours. In a sense we are sorry for the *i
man. He didn’t perhaps know that he was doing
anything so very out of the way in perching him-
self outside the drag and gazing down upon the
multitude. Loch’s orderlies have acquired a
haughty contempt for the multitude since
one of them sent a decent working man
to prison for jeering at him. Perhaps you
remember the circumstance. The bold warrior
was riding over Prince’s Bridge, Melbourne, when
the disgusted son of toil said, “ Who's this on
’orseback, putting on such a lot of side
That outspoken criticism was punished with a
shameful sentence of imprisonment. How subtle
and how wonderful are class distinctions 1 The
orderly who cm sit on a working man isn’t per.
mitted to sit on His Excellency’s kerrldge.

The obituary verses perpetrated by the
corpse poet of the Sydney Evening News are
rising to the dignity of a national catastrophe. A
few days ago he got a contract to muse over the
remains of Alfred Cain, who died 12 months ago,
and, in answer to the call, he hunted out six of his
best slop odes, and ran them in to comfort the
bereaved household. The sloppiest of the six
was as follows:
“ Poor Alfred gone I I saw him go;
I stood and heard him speak,
And when I heard his dying words
I thought my heart would break.”
Why did he not sit down to hear him speak ?
Moreover, it would greatly Improve the rhyme if
the last two lines could be altered to read
He used to work when here below
“ For eighteen bob a week.”
We have also been in mourning for a dear friend
lately, an old and attached bookseller, who used to
call round regularly and ask us to subscribe for a
family blble complete in 12 parts, and on hearing
of his loss we at once hired the olßoe-boy to strike
his lyre in honour of the deceased. He has just
handed in the following maiden effort, which we
will back against the Noose for any money that
may be wanted
We are weeping for our Daniel,
Who died last week at Stanwell,
Up in Queensland, where the kangaroo the wild
ba :ana chews.
He was aged 37,
And our hearts with grief are riven,
For he’s gone to rest with Abraham and all them
ancient Jews.
We would point out on behalf of the office-boy
that his lines contain a number of solid and valu-
able fact regarding the departed, which the
Nooze poet entirely omits. He explains briefly
and distinctly the name and age of the late book-
canvatssr, and the place and time of his death, and
finishes up by affording a clue to his present
whereabouts. He also expresses, with deep
pathos, the anguish we are suffering at his loss,
while the deep funereal gloom which might other-
wise grow painful in Its intensity, is tenderly and
delicately shaded by the outline sketch of the
Queensland kangaroo chewing the banana in the
back-ground. The sympathising smile of the
uncultured marsupial shines out amid the gloom
like a brass-headed nail beaming in the roof of an
old hair trunk, and the whole verse is instinct with
the fervour of true poetry. If the Nooze could
hire a bard like this to write its half-crown obitu-
ary “ads.,” the death column might be made a
success.
WALKER!
South Australia’s sons were naughty,
Fraud was common through the land,
Till this faithful-feeling forty
Took their comrades’ case in hand;
Christian men were sent to prison
(Think of Crooks’and Walker’s case \)
But forty saviours have arisen
For this very favoured race.
Sin may, like a shadow, darken
Other districts, it is true;
But the Lord will surely hearken
To these earnest, pleading few;
Satan (sometimes called the Devil)
Still may reign in distant parts—
Never more shall thought of evil
Sully South Australian hearts.
You, who might have grilled In Hades-
Tortured by infernal fire—
Bless these gentlemen and ladles
When you twang the golden lyre;
Think, you might have found damnation—
Sweltered in sulphurous shade—
Save for prayer and supplication
Offered up in Adelaide.
When you chorus “Jubilate”
(As you will, without a doubi),
Don’t forget that p'erio party
Which has brought sour biles abo.t;
As you fly around in glory,
Innocent of fleshly talntr,
Tell your friends the simple story
Of those forty faithful saints.
SONG TO THE SILENT CIRCLE.
Ye “ circle ” swells, who sit afrai i
To mark your approbation,
Like other folks of lower grade
And greater animation,
Take heart 1 and clap your lily hands—
You never need be frightened—
'ns done, it seems, in other lands
By people more enlightened.
Her Gracious Majesty the Queen
(May Time new comforts bring her!)
Was—note the fact—distinctly seen
To clap a concert-slngcr;
And, after such a gorgeous leftd,
’Twere only right and flt-o
That you should emphasise your breed
By doing ditto ditto.
We>e studied oft your languid style,
Observed (with stealthy snigger)
How e’en the spectre of a smile
You didn’t think “de rlgger”S
In vain did prime donlt sing
And mummers make mugs at you—
Applause you didn’t deem the thing,
SO) still as statues, sat you.
But now you've heard the latest news
We shall be seeing shortly,
A revolution in your viewi
On customs that are courtly;
You’ll emulate is your applause
The gods in all their glory;
You will, you will, you know you will—
It’s done by Queen Victoree.
Yes, this is news to make us vain—
And who dares say ’tls not ?
That our Lord Governor should deign
To drink from a quart-pot—
To drink from a quart-pot, and eke
To eat from a tin-plate—
Thank Heaven, that this news unique
Has not arrived too late I
To think that one whoso ways belong
To other spheres than these—
One who by lords and aides-de-camp
Is Served bn bended knees—
Who eats ffond golden dishes, with
Bright Jewels set therein—
In fact, our very owil Lord Smith
Should condescend to tin I
Then rise and cheer w 11116 you can stand,.
Though demagogues may frown»
This act has made us loyal, and—
We grovel to the Crown.
And when there comes in f attire days*
Another hour of need
To England, shall we not, sirs, raise
More troops for her to bleed ?—
You bet we will. And blazing on
Our banners you shall spot
These words: “Remember Carington,
The tin-plate and quart-pot.”
AUSTRALIANA
A Mr. Bawler took a prominent part in a
Sydney conceit last week.... The much-respected
Inspector Waters, of the Sydney Police, who died
suddenly last week, was one of the 50 men drafted
about 1852 from the London force for service in
N.B.W At Glen Innes, according to a local
paper, the two burning questions just now are the
Second Coming of the Lord, and the Joint Stock
Bakehouse. These items do not seem to have any
special connection, but they are bracketed to-
gether all the same.... The Queen, a “toney”
English paper, publishes a list of "Australian”
agents, and then adds, separately, those ; in
“Queensland.”.... Sydney E. News tells us how
they tried in America to cremate a man whose
head wouldn’t burn. He couldn’t have been an
ex-member of the Sydney Corporation
A witness in a Melbourne ass*ult case complains
that he was hit on the head with “ some nard sub-
stmce,” Perhaps he expected to be brained with
the butt-end of a pillow... Charles Christian, a
grandson of the Bounty mutineer, died in Norfolk
island on Queen’s Birthday.. .About 700 men are
now on the Croydon.... A large number of "dis-
tinguished Australians" were "commanded ’ py
Queen Victoria to lunch at Windsor Castle last Mon-
day. A private cablegram received on Tuesday
states that they have teen commanded not to
lunch there anv more J. G Chiopendall died
last week, aged 79, He entered the Government
service at the age of 19, and was the first
gaoler in Bathurst, which position he held
till about 15 years ago, when he retired. What a lot
of floggings the old man must have "assisted" at..
We read in a London paper that "among the many
celebrities assembled at a big reception given by
Mrs. Beerbohm at Glanricame Girdens, Miss Am y
Sherwin (‘the Tasmanian Nightingale’) delighted
her auditors with her charming voice ; she is one
of the few ladies who look pretty whilst singing.”

cause in a district which boasted two parsons and
a multitude of lay Christians no one couid ne

An Auckland Freethought paper calls on its
readers to pay up on the plea that “ He who giveth

the plays attributed to him, as when young he
“possessed all those qualities which in the present
day constitute a dangerous larrikin. A youth like
Shakespeare would be a hero in Woolloomooloo.”
A correspondent of a Sunny Corner journal
says he has traversed the United states, Mexico,
and Alaska, but ho never saw a desert like “this

THE GLORIOUS FOURTH.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
This is a Jubilee, a day of joy I
For freemen all;
This day did Liberty—that virgin coy—
At Freedom’s call,
Erect, o’er thraldom's grave, on blood-fat earth.
Her temple grand,
Whose glowing altar flames keep warm each hearth
Throughout your land.
This day did Tyranny retreat before
Virginian blades;
This glorious day meet, on your peaceful shore,
Eleven decades;
This day the haughty Norman’s claws were
clipped—
Disastrous
This day the bird of freedom’s shell was chipped;
Hal', glorious day!
Sprung from the self-same nook of sea-girt earth,
Of one stout race;
Just after you won Freedom was our birth;
We fill your place;
Our day to seek the upward path you trod,
Comes on us fast;
Nor need we armed walk, red-hand, rough-shod,
Those days are past;
Columbia h all 1 A sister sends you cheer.
And happy days;
May peace and plenty crown each generous year,
And mankind’s praise;
Thy health! Kepubllc great, with glory fraught,
Place these poor lays,
A tribute to the deeds your hands have wrought
Among your bays.

Mayor Young is getting old.
The bakers in some parts of Victoria are
unitin? to raise the price of bread. Some of these
days 11 will be a baaer s dozen instead of 13.
The Fourth of J uly turned up on a Sunday
this time, and, of course the flare-up tookpla. e
on the day following. Wonder If the Day of
Judgment will be similarly postponed should it
occur on a Sabbath ?
From S.M. Hebai/d :—“ A.B.G.—Return
or write at once. All financial matters settled
satisfactorily.—Y.Z.” We presume that this signi-
fies that the old woman has once more squared his
beer-score.
A lot of papbrs object to the test question
put to each candidate tor membership of the Aus-
tralian Natives' Association: -‘Areyou moderately
moral ? ” on the ground that “ moderately mora 1 ,’
under the circumstances, leally means'‘mode-
rately immoral.” We, however, are glad to see
the Australian natives display evidences of cau-
tion. Immoderately moral men, like Crcots,
would so very often disgrace the Association by
getting into gaol.
An individual who calls himself “ Gerald
Finch- Hatton,” and who was for some tlm<? a
public nuisance In Sydney, appeared amongst the
drunkards at the Brisbane Police Court last Mon-
day. Gerald, who alleges that he la a 8® of the

NSW. Crown solicitor with his chest stloklrg out
and his Hatton. Mr. Williams steadily regarded his
illustrious visitor for a moment; then, clapping
on his own tile, said, "Now, sir, we are on an
equality—what can I do for you ? ”

A very enjoyable ball was held in Sydney
Town Hall on Monday evening, to celebrate the
110th anniversary of the Declaration of American
Independence About 400 were present, and, as
admission for two people cost three guineas, the
committee had no reas m to be dissatisfied on the
score of attendance The general arrangements
were extremely good. The supuj was both sub-
stantial and elegant, recherche refreshments were
plentifully served during the evening; the pro-
grammes were most tasteful, and the music, by
Needs’ band, was admirable, and played through a
programme of 30 dances. Tin vestibule was
decorated with ferns and pot-plants, and American
and Australian fltga were gracefully draped about
the walls. The places of rendezvous were well-
arranged. Etch bore the name of an American
State or city printed in large letters on a con-
spicuous il ig. and at each of these rendezvous was
a gentleman who acted as master of ceremonies.
The ball was announced to take at nine
o'clock, and punctually at that time Lird and
Lady Carington arrive!, accompanied by Miss
Wheelan, Mr. Wellington, Pi., Captain Sheriffe
and Lord Bertie, A.sD C. Th-y were received by
Consul Gridin, and the bend struck up the
National Anthem The first set of quadril es was
firmed by Lord Carington and Mrs Cnipman
vls-a vis to Consul Griffin and Lady Canngton,
the sides being taken by tne Mayor and Miss K. ffilo
and Mr. Kahlo with the Mayoress. The toilettes
worn by the ladles were of an extremely handsome
description- Am ingst the vis tors were the Bight
Hon, W. B. Dailey. Sir Patrick Jennings and Lady
Jen tings. Mr. and Mrs. C. J. Kcberts, the Hon.
J. Fletoner, Cady and the Misses Manning, G neral
Furlong, Captain Lake. RN., Mr. and Mrs. John
Purvps Mr. and Miss Hogg, Mrs. Gullett, Mr. and
Mrs. Fischer, Miss Traill. Mrs Burrs, Mrs. Moulton,
&o. Lady Carington wore a quiet and tasteful dress
of pale pink, with beautiful diamonds in her hair;
Mrs. Chlpman, a lovely dreis of rich white satin,
relieved by primrose velvet; Miss Young, the
Mayoress of Sydney, a pretty pink dress; Miss
Kahlo, all white ; Mrs. M Quade looked cMc In a
costly white dress composed of beautltul soft
figured Bhk and train oc terry velvet ; Miss C ara
Manning looked well in a pale-blue satin and tulle,
Miss Guilett wore an old gold satin, veiled with
nut-brown tulle, and an uncommon necklet of
rnlnutn rosary b°ads ; Miss Mai ien, pal 3-blue f atin,
Mrs. Ferrlday, old gold satin and rich black lace ;
Mrs. Andrews, pure while satin and pearls ;
Mrs. Coates, an elaborate gown of pale pink
and blue silk, with back draperies of pale
blue broche, pink aigrette in her hair; Mrs.
Fischer, handsome black lace dress, with a
spray of natural flowers on the corsage, Mrs
Lakeman. pale-blue satin, trimmed with white
lace; Mrs. Moulton, a much-admired dress of
dull green velvet, with pale-green plumes tailing
over the right shoulder. Not a few ladles compli-
mented the Americans by shoving stars and
stripes somewhere about their costumes, one lady
having the p-etty flag painted on each end of her
sash, whilst Mrs Chlpman showed her nationality
bv her fan. The only drawbacks of the ball were
that there were few uniforms in the room, and
that the ladles cmslderably outnumbered the
gentlemen.

Mr. Horatio Gilbert Parker’s first dramatic
and humorous recital was given at Sydney Town
Hall one evening last week, and, with the help of
Lord Carington, attracte I a large audience. As at
least some few peonle really went to hear Mr.
Parker, and not to stare at vice-royalty, it was too
bad that the gorgeous Ushers engaged dido t give
as many as tin y could a show—or rather a hear.
The ushers aforesaid teemed to delight in crowd-
incr everyone into the worst seats* declaring* the
■while that all the rest were occupied, despite the
point-blank contradiction afforded to their impu-
dent assertion by rows of vacant chairs in the best
part of the hall. People unavailiogly made ear
trumpets of their hands, but even then Mr.
Parker’s elocution was almost utterly lost. Those
who were able to hear, however, were unanimous
in praising the entertalnment-which, when It is
given again, should be carefully kept out of
Sydney Town Hall.

A Fancy Fair, in aid of Christ Church
organ fund, was held In the vestibule of Sydm-y
Town Hall, on last Thursday, Friday, and Satur-

and with the help ot the parishioners, the baziar
has proved a great success. The stalls were
arranged '.about the vestibule, and were presided
over by Misses Garnsey and Greville, Misses Z illner,
Miss Knight, Mrs Buck, and the Misses Wilkinson.
The affair was a very pretty siaht, and its attrac-
tions were much enhanced by the fancy-dress cos-
tuoiss worn by the stall-holders. The fiower-girls
were especially irresi tible.

The Sydney Philharmonic Society gave
Kowalski’s “ Ycrcingetorlx ” in the great hall of
tne University, on the evening of Thursday, July
1 The work has been performed in Sydney be-
fore. and will probably be heard again. The hall
was packed-even standing room’was ecarce-and
M Kowalski was gratified by the compliments of
Lord land Lady Cailngton at the finish of the con-
cert. Miss Saville looked nice in a ruby and pink
satin dress, and sang her solos as it she ha! really
made a study of them. Mias Mountcastie also
warbled sweetlv. but Mr. Halle well was hardly
himself. Mr. Vernon Keid, who seemed some-
what troubled about the curls on his alabaster
forehead, was in good voice; and the choruses
were fairly given. Amongst the orchestra, despite
the presence of many of the best performers,
things were by no means perfect. The composi-
tion IB certainly worthy of better treatment, for,
as was evident to all musicians, Id is really a very
tine work. Mons. Kowa’ski conducted, and Mr.
Klvers Alpress led the orciestra with his accus-
tomed ability.

On Wednesday, 30tfi ult, Miss Marian
Chadwick, eldest daughter ot Mr. Robert Chad-
wick, of Arlington, ndgec’.ifle-road, Woollahra,
was married, at A'l Saints' Woollahra, to Mr. N.
Newberry, of Sydney Grammar School. The
church was most beautifully and tastefully
decorated with green fo iage and rare flowers-tbe
work of some young lady friends ot the bride—
nnd a lovely arch of flowers just at tbe entrance to
the transept was greatly admired. At two o clock
the bride entered the church leaning on her
father’s arm. She was folioved by two small
ri urea and four bridesmaids, the bridegroom and
bis best man, Mr. Whitfield, being ready to receive
them The Primate, assisted by the Revs. W.
Mort W. M'Arthur, and Mr. Helton, performed
the ceremony. The service was choral. The
bride’s dress was composed of heavy white bro-
eided velvet and white satin, the bodice laced in
iront and finished eff with pearl lace. Tne
usual long tulle veil and wreath of orange-
blossoms were worn on the head, with the
addition of a beautiful diamond and pearl
nln the gift cf the bridegroom. The four
bridesmaids were attired exactly alike m
becoming and pretty frocks of white china silk,
with panels and waistcoats of heliotrope satin. The
ema'l bonnets were soft white drawn tube, with
bunches ot heliotrope, and each young lad y carried
a bouquet of heliotrope, maidenhair ferns, and
rosebuds. Miss B. Cruickahank was chief brides-
maid, the other three being Miss Nellie Manning,
Mi a L Busby, and Miss Armstrong. One of tne
fwo sliall pages, was master Herbeit Chadwick,
dreaded in a fanciful costume of tmavy blue vel-
vet with large white lace collar. The otter page
wore a handsome black velvet suit, as the bridal
nartv left the church, M ss Woolley played the
••Wedding March." The guests then adjourned
to Arlington, where refresamenta were served. The
■wedding presents were numerous and handsome.
Tne guests, of whom there were many, Ineluded the
Primate, Sir W. and Lady Manning and the Misses
Manning, the Rev. W. Maoarthur aid Mlaa Mac-

Mr. Weigal), &o. Mr. .and Mrs Newberry left for
their honeymoon to Moss Yale, amidst good
wishes, pretty slippers, and showers of rice. The
bride’s travelling-gown was navy-blue material,
braided with black, small black bonnet, with
scarlet feathers.

No luncheon was provided at Liverpool
races last Saturday, and thin was, of course, a great
disappointment and annoyance to those who had
gone without picnic baskets. It seems, though,
that nobody in particular was to blame for this
oversight which was due to some hitch in the
Licensing Act. The weather was simplyEperfect,
and the course in grand order. The ladies were
not numerously represented, but still some half-a-
dozen prettv dresses were to be noticed. A grey
plush overall, with large rod buttons and rei cord,
was noticeable; and a pretty dre e w .8 composed
of pale-blue frisi cloth, artistically draped at the
back, the front panel and vest being of bronze-
coloured velvet, small bonnet and parasol to
correspond. A handsome gown was royal-blue
plush trimmed with grey-feather binding, small
grey bonnet ornate with bin? aad crimson velvet
bows.

In The Bulletin’s “Social” column this
week is described a “swagger” marriage that
took place in Sydney last weea. It is satlsfec.ory
to find that here we understand how the knot
should be tied in style America is far behind us
in this as in other matters. For Instance, the
President of the U.S. of America, who rules some
50,003,000 folks, got married last month. This inci-
dent created some slight interest m social circle?,
and had been talked of as quite an event tor
several days previously. It dees not take much to
be an event in America. A Potts Point wedding
held in the States would keep the Union lively lor
months beforehand. However, Mr. Cleveland got
mrrtied to Miss Folsom Only 36 parsers were pre-
sent at the wedding, and as they merely included
the great officers of the Government, they went
for to account in the show. But the bffirns
dresses did. There was a time when men eminent
for politics, literature, and art, were worthjmen-
tloning. But that sort of trash is over.
say Tennyson or Lowell—is nothing compared to
his wife’s drees. That’s something to be proud
of. Any man might dp "oopy” like, ‘‘ln
Memoriam,” or 11 the Blglow Papers, oat
where's the man who can own a wife who can
show a dress that will make her the best-hated
woman In (he room ? You can count them all on
the toes of a wooden leg, That’s the true test of
“ worth.” Pope, and he knew a thing or two,
distinctly tells as that —
“ Worth makes the man—the want of It the fellow;
The rest is all but leather or prunella.”
And so it ought to be. ’ The President, in this
case, is dismissed in one line; we are told he ‘‘was
pale and nervous;” and then betakes a back
seat for the rest of the show, and makes way for
some 25 columns of matter descriptive of the
dresses worn by Miss Folsom—her mamma, aunts,
and female hangers-on. We don’t understand
much about these things, but Miss Folsom
seems to have-worn enough clothes to have
thawed the North Pole had it been dressed in
them. The company, after the parson had done
his best, went to the supper-room, and while the
guests were eating, Mrs. C. slipped out and got
info travelling dress. “She allowed herself 40
minutes to make the change, but before that time
a trunk was brought downstairs, and she and Mr.
Cleveland followed, and with the whole company
running after them and throwing handfuls of rice
at them as they fled from the corridor. The bride
wove a travelling drets of dark-gray silk and camel
hair. A border of narrow white stripes half a
yard deep trimmed the skirt, and the draperies
were of the same fine stripes. A long double-
breasted waistcoat, trimmed with cut-steel but-
tons, opened over a vest of white stripes, and a
square plaston of gray velvet fell from a high
rolling collar. With this she wore a large English
hat of gray straw, lined with gray velvet, and
trimmed with stilt rows of Plcot ribbon. Dark
gray undressed kid gloves went w.th the cos-
tumes.” The gifted reporter pursues the victims
to their honeymoon-quarters, and tells all he can
about the place. But we do not care to loliow.

Are the Victorians desirous of a change
In their fiscal policy ? At the election held last
week for the representation of the Wellington
Province in the Legislative Council, the Liberal
and Protectionist candidate, Mr. David Ham,
obtained a majority of 700 votes over the Conser-
vative and Freetrader, Mr. T. D. Wanliss. Tee
result Is more than usually significant, as the elec-
tion was taken on the ratepayers' roll alone, man-
hood-suffrage voters having no voice in the
creation of the Victorian upper House.
When Mr. William Clarke, M.L.A. for
Orange, found he was not included in the last
Dibbs Ministry, he endeavoured, after the re
assembling of the present Parliament In November
last, to form a new party. He soon discovered,
however, that he did not enjoy the unbounded
confidence of his fellow-members. He then ap-
pointed himself the leader of the “ hay and corn”
party, and tabled a motion In favour of putting a
tax on foreign produce, and he also told the
Government that the proper way to make
up the deficit was by means of ad valorem
duties. The same William Clarke who proposed

te lookfnv forward to a of the go“d old
blue-shht days of Bendigo and Ballarat, and still
they go. Nor la it any wonder they want to
recall these bygone times. The sun shone
brighter then, the whisky was purer, the
Presbyterian Synod was meeker, and things
were happier all round. Sir Graham Berry
was running a small general store about that
period, and giving over-weight with the flour and
potatoes—at least people said so; Sir Henry Parkes
was selling jumping-jacks, tops, and yellow
wooden monkeys, and was a humble but respected
citizen; and Sir Julius Vogel was writing up
“ drunfes,” dog-flghts, marriages of storekeepers
daughters, and other interesting items, in his
capacity as a very small man on a very small paper.
It is the memory of these things that Is sending
the present generation to dig for gold and
K M.C G.-ships at Kimberley, but their prospects
seem hardly so bright as did those of their pro-
genitors.
Editors are fond of calling the Press the
pulpit of the present day. They also allude to it
as the “ Pillar of Morality, and the Buttress of
Virtue.” But a Gippsland editor is an editor by
himself. He says what he thinks, and cares nothing
for the unwritten laws of literature For Instance,
a girl living a Jong way from Warragul (Vic.)
“cleared out,’ from her foster-mother the other
night—through a back-window, too—and against
that foster-mother’s will came clattering on horse-
back into Warragul, and forthwith got married to
the galoot of her choice. Wb»t does the editor of
the Warragul Guardian say ? Does he don the
black cap of condemnation ? Does he hold her up
as a shocking example to other self-willed young
women, and prognosticate that she will have cause
to repmt her headstrong act? Not he. Ho just
pats her on the back and crows about her through
a good part of a column, winding up with this
depraving sentence:—" Of course, our readers will
join with us in admiring the pluck of the young
lady, and so will her fester-mother in less than a
month, we would venture to bet.” And yet we
presume that is a pape which is read bv the fire-
side and left around on the family gin-case. There
n r w is cn editor who has no regard for the respon-
sibilities of his noble profession. Yet we can
haid y blame the poor fellow. QJpnsland is a
sparsely-populated place, and he naturally favours
anything which will tend to increase the popula-
tion—which, of course means subcorlbers. H© is,
we think, a very far-seeing man in this case, how-
ever.

BM’LY AND THE M.P.
“ These are mine,” said an old gontloman, enter-
ing of the hotels near Circular Quay. “All
right,” said Emily, the barmaid. ‘‘Just be careful
not to charge me with them twice.” “That Is
something I never do,” sa’d Emily. “You had
better not overcharge me, because I keep all the
drinks in my head.” “I k*ew that before you
ssoke. Are you a member of Parliament?” “Yes.”
“ Anyone can tell that ,j nst by looking at you. If
all the members would stick to Anheuser Busc i
St. Louis Lager Beer and drink nothing else they
would have a clear head and do more business for
the country.”
Clergymen, Lawyers, Editors, Bankers
and Ladies need American Hop Bitters daily, for
nerve force. Read
The Great Northern Hotel, Cbarlotte-
place and George street, is unapproachable for
cheapness, combined with good quality. The
motto is—Small profits and quick returns.*

It used to be customary to send judges for
the High Courts of Calcutta out from England, and,
of course, they knew no Hlndostani. One of them
was instructing an interpreter to tell a murderer
(atmut to be condemned) “to make bis peace with
God. that he was found by a jury guilty of a crime
al?ke detestable to white and black men, that no
hone of mercy csuld be held out, &c., &0m and
mav the Lord* have mercy on his suul. This is
what the interpreter said: “ Suno soor, nundara
Kfi fansi hogaV’-r Listen, pig. on the 15th there
will be hanging.’’) The judge remarked that the
vernacular was a very comprehensive language.

The strictest examiner may try every test of touch

** * Bochesteu, June 1, 1883. “ Ten Years
ago 1 was attacked with me most Intense and
deathly pains In ray back &nd—Kidneys
“ Extending to the end ef my toes and to
my brain !
“ Which made me delirious!
“From agony ! ! ! !
“ It took three men to hold me on my bed
at times !
“The Dectors tried in vain to relieve me,
but to no purpose.
Morphine and other opiates !
“ Had no effect!
“ After two months I was given up to
die ! ! ! !
“ Wnen my wife
heard a neighbour tell what Hop Bitters had
done for her . she at once got and gave me
some. The first dose eased my brain and
seamed to go hunting through my system
for the pain.
The second dose eased me eo much that I slept
two hours Something I had not done for two
months. Before I had used five bottles, I was well
and at work as hard as any man oouid, for over
three weeks; but I worked too hard for my
st.engtb, ana taken a bard coll, I was taken with
the most acute and painful rheumatism all through
my system that was ever known.
“I called the doctors again, and after seyera,
weeks they left me a cripple en crutebei for llte!
as they said. I met a inend and told him my case,
and he said Hop Bitters had cured him and would
cure me. I coohed at him, but he was so earnest
1 was induced to use them again.
In less than four weeks I threw away my crutches
and went to work lightly and ki pt on using the
nltters for five weeks, until I became as we 1 as
any man liviog, and have been so for six years
sloce.
It has also cured my wife, who had been
sick for years; and has kept her and my
children well and healthy with from two to
three bottles a year. There is no need to be
sick at all if U ese bitters are used.
J. J. Bebk, Ex-Supervisor.
“ That poor invalid wife, Sister, Mother,
“ Or daughter ! ! ! !
“ Can be made the picture of health !
with a few bottles of Hop Bitters !
“ Will you let them suffer!!!!”
Prosecute the Swindlers !!
If when you call for American Hop Bitters (see
green twig of Hops on the white label and Dr. Soule's
name bhwn in the bottle ) the vendor hands cut
anything but American Hop Bitters refuse it and
shun that vendor as you would a viper; and If he

(S)
Are admitted by thou-
sands. to be worth a
Guinea a Box for bilious
and nervous disorders,
such ,as wind and pain
in the stomach, sick
headache, giddiness,
fulness and swelling
after meals, dizziness
and drowsiness, cold
chills, flushings of heat,
loss of appetite, short-
ness of breath, costive-
ness,scurvy, blotches on
the skin,disturbed sleep,
frightful dreams,and all
nervous and trembling
sensations, &c. The first
dose will give relief in
twenty minutes. This is no fiction, for they have
done it in thousands of cases. Every sufferer is
earnestly invited to try one box of these Pills, and
they will he acknowledged to be
WORTH A GUINEA A BOX.
For femal.es of all ages these Pills are invaluable,
as a few dos'es of them carry off all gross humours,
open, all obstructions, and bring about all that is
required. No female should be without them. There
is no medicine to be found to equal BEECHAM’S

of the systesa. If taken according to the directions
given with each box they will soon restore females of
all ages to seund and robust health.
For a weak stomach, impaired digestion and all
disorders of the liver, they act like “ MAGIC,” and a
few doses will be found to work wonders upon the
most important organa of the human machine. They
strengthen the whole muscular system, restore the
long-lost complexion, bring back the keen edge of
appetite, and arouse into action with the ROSEBUD
of health the whole physical energy of the human
frame. These are “ FACTS ” admitted by thousands
embracing all classes of society; and one of the
best guarantees to the nervous and debilitated is,
Beecham’s Pills have the largest sale of any patent
medicine in the world.

culty in Breathing, Shortness of Breath, Tightness

Some take their pleasure o'er ihelr pipe,
Some love the wine-cup’s ruddy glow;
But all who’d highest joys partake.
Earth’s very ohiefest joy would know,
Should see the champion cutter wield
The shears for Messrs. Summerfleld.*
Many ladies are reluctant about buying
the best of crockery because of the alleged care-

Carnrick’s Cod Liver Oil & Milk
PEPTONISED (DIGESTED.)
Highly recommended by the Medical Profession throughout the world as being
the best remedy for Coughs, Colds, Bronchitis, Scrofula, Wasting
Diseases, Consumption, General Debility, over-tased brains, &c., &c.
It will produce an immediate gain in flesh and strength.
Can be taken when all other forms of Cod Liver Oil are refused.
It contains about equal parts of tho best Norwegian Cod Liver Oil and concen-
trated fresh rpilk, both peptonised (digested).
The peptonised milk disguises the unpleasant taste and smell of the oih and
makes it as sweet as cream; very palatable and most nourishing.
Invaluable for children, and will agree with the most delicate persons, causing
no return or unpleasantness.
One trial ■will satisfy anyone of the great value of this new and unique pre-
paration. _ . ,
The reconstructive or nutritive properties are five times greater than the
plain oil or anv other Emulsion, hence it is much cheaper.
Both the Oil and the Milk being digested, the whole will assimilate, whereas
in Cod Liver Oil and other Emulsions (being undigested) only a small
proportion is of any value. It is the most nerfect Emulsion ever
made, and the only one of digested Cod Liver Oil and Milk.
Analysed and recommended by the first Professors in Europe.
We also manufacture the above preparation combined with Hypophosphites
of Lime and Soda. SOLD BY ALL CHEMISTS.
THE MALTINE MANUFACTURING CO., LIM., LONDON.
Important to Mothers Mums
Carnrick’s Soluble Food for Infants, Invalids,
and Aged Persons, is the most nutritious, palatable, and easily-digested Infant’s
Food ever manufactured, containing fifty per cent, of the solids of milk (digested),
and fifty per cent, of the finest wheat, converted into soluble form.
A most perfect food. The nearest approach to Mother’s Milk ever made.
It is unequalled for the formation of fat, flesh, and bone, and increasing
the vital forces so necessary to health.
Specially recommended in cases of Marasmus, Diarrhoea, and Cholera
Infantum, and where the digestion is defective.
Children fed upon cereals or cow’s milk alone very often remain weak, and
suffer from softening of the bones, and when attacked by infantile dis-
orders are unable to resist the inroads of disease.
“CARNRICK’S SOLUBLE FOOD” is invaluable for Invalids
and Aged Persons (who cannot digest farinaceous food), as it is rich
in nutritive and easily-digested albumenoids, thus increasing both flesh
and strength, and restoring the vital forces.
It is most convenient for use,being in a powdered form, and will keep indefinitely.
When boiled and stirred for three minutes it is ready for immediate use.

The triumph of mechanical skill in the watch
makers art has just received itslpremier exempiifl
cation by the new series of Waterbary watche
which arrived by the Mariposa on Thursday las
During the past decade immense strides have bee
made in the direction of cheapening the cost o
horologlcal Instruments of all discretions, a
though in a great many cases at the sacrifice
their accuracy; but the idea of a really reliabl
and durable watch for the ml lion.ataprioewithi
the reach of all, originated with and has been per
fected by the Waterbary Watch Company, th
practical outcome of whesa researches is shown 1
their present improved "E” series of watches-
the fourth which tha development of modern
science, and their indomitable enterpise has le
them to I-sue within the past seven years. It i
not many years since the dream of a handsom
reliable watch which would record the flight o
time with unerring accuracy, and which would a
i ,a? ame tlfoe be obtainable for the comparative!
trifling sum of thirteen shillings and sixoenc
would have been laughed at as thoroughly im
practicable and U opian ; but to-day it is n
stretch of imagination but a solid imperisbabl
fact that the Waterbury ” has become synony
th ® whole habitable world, with re
Jlability, strength, and beauty, and a prim© incen
tive to punctuality in commercial, professional
scholastic, and social life. In these high pressur
times, when the attention of thousands of think
ing men is directed toward shortening the hours o
labour, and when the keenness of home anc
foreign competition renders it of the utmost im
portanoe to secure the greatest output of work
within the recognised hours of business, the pos-
session of a thoroughly reliable timekeeper en-
tirely ceases to be a fad, a convenience, or a badge
of respectiblllty, but an absolute essential to suc-
cess. The man who misses his trains, trams, or
steamers; who neglects his appointments, or loses
track of his minutes; who regulates his actions
by a faulty, erratic watch, soon finds himself left
out of the ride of prosperity, and never comes
within 000-ee of his successful ne'ghbor, the only
secret of whose success is that he carries a Water-
bury, and lives “ on time.”
In an action for necessaries in the Supreme
Court of Great Britain, it was long ago decided
that a gold watch was not a necessity.—A Water-
bury, price thirteen and sixpence, always shows
the correct time, which is after all the great de-
sideratum of a watch, and a hundred guinea
jeweled movement cannot possibly do more,
although it often fails to do even that.
The clerk, the assistant, the artizan, the miner,
or the laborer, who is habitually late, soon gets
into bad repute, loses employment, or at least de-
stroys his chance of promotion; and the thread-
bare excuses, “ Didn’t know the time,” or “ Watch
was wrong,” are no longer tenable, seeing that the
value of a week’s lost time is frequently sufficient
to buy a Waterbury. Every man, woman, and
child who desires to avoid or get rid of the annoy-
ance, uncertainty, and discomfort of carrying a
watch they cannot entirely depend upon, should
purchase a Waterbury, even if they have to dis-
card their much more expensive but faithless ap-
pendages, as many of our bankers, merchants,
railway and Government officials, inspectors of
ponce, and railway contractors have already done.
Remember that the Waterbury is a keyless, stem
watch, unequalled anywhere for accuracy and
reliability, and for the strength and beauty of its
finish; price, thirteen shillings and sixpence. In
this connection it may be well to utter a note of
warning. Although we arc producing 1000 watches
per day, or
313,000 WATCHES
a year, we have been so far tolally unable
to keep pace with the demand, as tho entire
absence of stock and cessation of advertis-
ing for tho past three months amply testify;
and this circumstance has induced unscrupul-
ous imitators to flood the market with de-
cidedly Inferior watches, which have been
offered as Waterburys, at much lower prioiSto
court sales. The reputation of the genuine
Waterbury is world-wide, and buyers should be-
ware of any watch offerel them by interested but
unfortunate dealers at any other than the regular
advertised price as a Waterbary, or Equal or
Nearly Equal to one.

jpiIRB AND FURY.
Fire may mean the last wax match which has
wriggled away amongst the fluff into the farthest
corner of the lonely traveller s vest pocket, and on
which his sole dependence is placed to get the pot
of tea he hankers after when his day’s journey is
done. Or it may mean the “ d sastrous confla-
gration ” caused ny the “devouring element” so
familiar to the readers of the daily papers. But
when the owner of the property comes home and
discovers that everythitg he had in the world has
bean burned to cinoeis, except a red-haired baby
and a three-legged dog. he sits down on the newest
heap ot cold ashes and remembers that he might
have avoided the whole tribulation had he used
Snowflake” Oil instead of the low-test rubbish
he bought at auction, because it went cheap. Then
comes fit No. 3, accompaaied by verbal tornadoes
and acrobatic performances on hi a hat. That is
fury—the natural result of his own folly.

Points
Mulhall, in his book “ Progress of the
■World,” says America has added £1(15,000 000 to its
wealth annually during the last 35 years.
On dit that General Boulanger, French
War Minister, meditates overthrowing the lie-
public and installing Comte de Paris as king.
IT Jaw-Bone Neild says that some of the
colonial beer is “ of very questionable quality and
does much harm.” Yes, it makes men talk a lot.
The Speaker of the N.S.W. Assembly has
ruled that the words “ political schemer ” are not
in order. Whole heaps of members now will miss
their proper designation.
SPA Sydney M.L.A. declared last week that
he had heard more nonsense during the debate on
the Customs Bill than he had listened to in all his
life before. Why, certainly. J. C. Neild spoke
for nine hours.
Labouchere. in commenting upon the use-
lessness of the English nobilitv in general, and of
most of thp Knights of the Garter in particular,
p'easanily draws attention to the decoration of
Lord Fife, a thistle worn upon the bosom, and asks
if the earl has ever done as much service to the
world as a costermonger’s jackass.
Parkes’ unqualified support of Home Rule,
and his statement to the effect that he’s only
afraid Gladstone’s scheme doesn’t go far enough,
is described in the Sydney E. News as “r. diabolical
bid for political patronage.” And yet Parkes is
allowed to remain at the head of the spineless
band of mlserables who form the now decimated
Orange faction in the NS. W, Assembly. Verily
the Orangemen like to be kicked and spat upon I
This epigram is from London Punch:—
“ LUCDS A NON LUCENDO.
“Loyal ? Nay, Ulster, you, for very shame,
Should cede your long monopoly of that name.
Loyal to whom—to what I To power, to pelf,
To place, to privilege, in a word, to self.
They who assume, absorb, control, enjoy all,
Must find it vastly pleasant to be “ loyal.”
In the N.BW. Assembly last week, Mr.
Dibbs rose to order because Dan. O Connor had
been speaking for 20 minutes and had not touched
the subject. This was really very foolish of Mr.
Dibbs. No one who knows Dan. ever expects him
to touch the subject at all. How can he lower
himself to ad valorem duties while Dimasthlnaise
is a character in history '{ Mr. Dibbs is too ab-
surdly commercial to be a critic of “ orathry.”
The London Times, it is cabled, charac-
terises Gladstone’s election addresses in Scotland
as “senile.” Recently, when the G.O.M. was run-
ning the Irish Coercion Bill through the Com-
mons, the Thunderer described the People's Wil-
liam as “ a man of extraordinary mental energy
for his years.” To paraphrase an old couplet;—
“ The Times cares not how great you be
If with the Times you don’t agree.”
The recent victory of the N.S.W. Govern-
ment over the ad valorem trouble seems to have
knocked several of the enemy even sillier than
they were before the battle. The “Jay nil” one,
for instance, declared that if he thought he would
have ever lived to see such a disastrous day he
would have died a hundred years ago; and Jaw-
bone Neild complains that “the Government have
a silent majority to support it, who, like dumb
sheep, applaud everything their leaders say or do.”
At the N.S.W. Burns Club’s last meeting,
a pleasant old gentleman named Teller related
how in the early political days of Sydney “a man
who was a candidate for Parliament had a re-
quisition drawn up in his favor which, on exami-
nation, was found to contain the names from the
tombstones in the neighbouring churchyard." No w-
a-days the people who lie under and are lied over
by tombstones don’t draw up Parliamentary re-
quisitions. But they vote at Parliamentary
elections.
The Melbourne Advocate thinks it is in-
advisable to allude by name to members of Parlia-
ment in the House, and points out that if an hon.
gentleman is simply described as the individual
who “was found guilty by a select committee of
taking money when a member and a Minister,” it
would answer all purposes. Unfortunately the
description is almost as vague as that of ‘ John
Jones, of Wales.” Even if people spoke of “ the
hon. member who was drunk last night,” or the
“gentleman who was kicked,” misunderstandings
might arise.
The believers in hereditary legislators
Would find their theory rudely jarred by a con-
templation of the two Parkes—father and son, in
the N.S.W. Assembly. The father a strong, fluent,
and vigorous speaker; the son a stammering,
illogical, and tiresome twaddler; the father a
statesman, the son a political duffer. There is as
much difference between them as there is between
Brickhill s Baby and Professor Miller. Genius of
whatever kind is very seldom a hertage It is a
pity, though, that geniuses cannot transmit that
to their sons—they can seldom bequeath anything
else.
Newspapers all the world over are report
fug with considerable gusto how Herr Most, the
German-American Socialist, was brought into
oourt “ handcuffed to a thief.” We have not the
honour of Herr Most’s acquaintance, but as his
grievances seem mostly of a political character,
wo suspend judgment on him till the Millennium.
Apropos of the thief and handcuffs, by the bye, we
invested 63- the other day in an old copy of the
Beersheba Times, which was for sale at the Tract
Society 's premises, and we came across an item
there about someone who was crucified some time
ago between two thieves. You can't judge a man
by the company he keeps under compulsion.
In an English suit, wherein the plaintiff,
Dr Pankhurst, claimed damages against a news
paper which published the report of an election
speech reflecting upon his character, Justice
Grantham, in summing up, said :—“The jury
would remember that they were not dealing with
the publication of a newspap?r in days when there
was ample time to carefully scrutinise every line
that appeared in it. It could not be said that the
publication of the full report of the speech could
do harm, because it had enabled Dr. Pankhurst to
know exactly what had been said, and gave him
an opportunity of denying it if he had thought
flt to do so.” Thus Is the English libel law
ameliorated by common sense. We could do with

becoming a matter of considerable moment to our
Victorian friends. Of the two leading Melbourne
papers, the protectionist Age is in an especially
delicate position, whereas the Akgus can afford to
air its c nsistency by denouncing “those half-
hearted politicians who are justifying ad valorem
duties ” That these denunciations are genuine
can be inferred from the following extracts from
a recent paragraph in the same paper:-“ The im-
position of 5 per cent, ad valorem duties by the
N S W Parliament is very seriously affecting the
trade of Victoria with that colony in reference to
soft goods and hoots and shoes. . . It Is also
found that the N.S.W. merchants are now so
favourably handicapped that In several Instances
Victorian merchants have had to withdraw tra-
vellers from the Riverina and outlying districts.”
Hence these Argus tears. It is a true Federal
grief, too. The “leading journal” bewails those
ad valorem duties on behalf both of N.S.W. and
Victoria. Especially the latter.
We hear that the seat for Canterbury in
the Commons, now held by Mr. Hennlker Heaton,
was offered to several other ambitious gentlemen,
who refused to accept it on account of a certain
just cause and impediment. In other words, their
means—c r their lavishness—were not equal to their
aspirations. It appears that the previous two or
three Conservative candidates who contested the
scat were unable to pay the reckoning, and the
consequence was a very heavy list of debts. The
story goes that at the late general election Canter-
bury was a certain Conservative seat if the pa> ty’s
debts were paid up, acd that the local Tory
authorities showed, in the first place at all events,
a strong disposition to stall off all candidates who
were not prepared to do the handsome thing—
which was a matter of £4OOO. Among those who
refused the tempting offer was Mr. Richards, the
barrister, who twice unsuccessfully opposed Brad-
laugh. Mr. Heaton was ultimately selected and
all his Australian friends can hope is that his
abilities were considered to be of so high an order
as to obviate the necessity of his “ parting.”
The aristocratic contempt which the
Sydney dailies and their appendant weeklies have
for the claims of labour is consistently shown In
their articles dealing with the so-called “ shearers’
strike.” To call the existing difficulty with re-
gard to shearing a “strike” is in itself an injus-
tice. The men have not thrown up their work
nor have they broken any agreement. They have
simply refused to enter upon a contract to do
work at a less sum than they have in other years
received. At Dunlop station, where the strike la
said to have begun, the men had not started work.
They came prepared to shear for a certain price,
and when a less price was named in the agreement
they refused to sign. That was the extent of the
alleged “ strike.” We do not propose to deal with
the peculiar equities of the q uestion beyond point-
ing out that the excuse of the squatters for mak-
ing the reductions was that wool had fallen, and
that the men should bear a portion of the loss of
profit, and that, wool having risen, the loss has
already decreased. Therefore, the squatters now
can hardly claim to get the resulting profit of the
rise out of the wool as well as out of the shearers.
They cannot expect to fleece the men and sheep
together.
Thus Vanity Fair “In all probability
the Government will fall to obtain from the
House of Commons a renewal of the Arms Act in
Ireland. The Radicals have always been against
it ; the 86 Irish members will of course vote
against it; and these will now be reinforced by
the Ulster Members, who, with their English and
Scotch sympathisers, will probably bring a
hundred votes. In view of this Act lapsing, many
inquiries are being made at Birmingham and else-
where as to a quick delivery of rifles and other
arms. Every man and boy in the North of Ire-
land will be armed at once. Inquiries are also
being made for Gatling and Nordenfeldt guns,
and the Orange Party are preparing to torpedo all
their harbours as a protection sgainst Gladstone’s
and Parnell’s gunboats, which may come North in
quest of taxes and rent which the boys of Ulster
will never pay to Parnell’s Parliament. The gar-
rison of Belfast is now composed of Scotch
soldiers, who certainly will not sympathise with
the Rapparees from the South. Lively times are
coming.” Thls'kind of brag seldom precedes any-
thing solid. It is very easy to advertise for 30,000
Boflelds, but it requires a much higher heroism to
raise the money to pay for them.
“ Lord” Wolseley has, it seems, not denied
that he said he would resign his commission to
lead the Ulster Orangemen; his disclaimer was
only to the effect that he had not publicly said
such a thing. Truth says it’s time Wolseley
should withdraw Into private life—"he is just the
sort of tool whom a Court or a Conservative
Ministry would use for a coup-d’etat, and with bis
swagger, his poor military performances, and his
greed to be rewarded for them, he always reminds
me of one of Napoleon’s coup d’ itat generals. He
may be a safe man as regards our enemies, but he
is by no means a safe man as regards our civil
liberties.” Truth also prints a sarcastic review of
Wolseley’s military achievements“ How humor-
ous, with its bit of pathos, too, Is the scene at
Balmoral on the afternoon of Tel-el-Keblr, as de-
picted in your Queen’s ‘More Leaves.’ To the
Royal Family, palpitating with suspense, comes
Wolseley’s ruggedly truthful telegram, telling
how Arabi’s position was ‘ most bravely stormed
by the Guards and Line,’ and how the Duke of
Connaught- [N.B.—Connaught never was In action
at all.—Ed. B]-‘behaved admirably, leading his
brigade to the attack.’ The women embrace, with
tears of pride and thankfulness. The retainers
gather around a table set with ‘ whisky and
glasses.’ Then the sublimated gillie steps from
behind his mistress’s chair and bellows for ‘ Three
cheers for the Duke of Connaught, the Hero of
Tel-el-Kebif 1’ To have produced this scene, even
at the expense of the derision of a nation and an
army,mustsurely be Wolseley’sproudest trophy.”
“ Anglo-Australian,” writing to the Syd-
ney E. News, evidently from an Orange lodge,
warns those concerned in the recent big Sydney
Home Rule meeting to repress their jubilation,
and tells them to remember that the success of
the affair was due to the “clemency” of the
Orangemen and Co., who stayed away on the occa-
sion. “Anglo-Australian” then carefully pro-
ceeds to let the yellow cat out of the bag by
shrieking; “ Has anyone ever given It a thought
of what an Irish Parliament means? Why, it
means Roman Catholic ascendancy in Ireland I”
From an Australian standpoint, the Protestant
ascendancy system in Ireland, after a pretty long
trial, doesn’t seem to have been a wonderful suc-
cess. “Anglo-Australian’s” threats as to what
Orangeism wifi da in the future don’t amount to
much. When the Irish agrarian question comes
to be settled up, as it must ultimately be, with a
strong Radical hand, the so-called loyalists of
Ulster won’t fight—they won’t even try to fight.
Those same “Loyalists,” when the Disestablish-
ment of the Irish Church Bill was brought in,
were, in the event of its passing, to rise in rebel-
lion and kick the Queen’s crown into the Boyne,
and generally smash all before them. Well, the
Church was disestablished, and those loud-
mouthed warriors did not even “ line a ditch,” nor
did they attempt to kick Her Majesty’s Crown.
They were quiet as lambs, and it will be just the
same when Home Rule comes along. Perhaps it
will be as well to remind people of the exact state
of the Ulster representation in the Parliament
just dissolved. Thirty-three members: IT Nation-
alists and 16 Conservatives. M’Cartby was de-
feated in Derry City by 39 votes, and Mr. Sexton,
another Home Ruler, in West Belfast, by 35. If
we leave out Belfast and Derry, we find that rural
Ulster returned to Parliament IT Nationalists and
11 Conservatives. These facts should be borne in
mind by those who blather about “Loyal Ulster.”
The municipalities of Melbourne and
suburbs are jumping at every convenient oppor-
tunity of overriding the Factories and Shops
Act. This provided for the early closing of most
places of business, and was created in the special
interest of the feeble-bodied women and feeble-
minded men, co-classifled as 11 drapers’ assistants.”
By acoident, or design, the a.ct was loosely drawn
up. To the municipalities is granted the power of
extending the hours of drudgery, upon the appli-
cation of a majority of shopkeepers in any par-
ticular line. Perhaps it would be impossible to
spot any individual man more inimical to en-
lightened social legislation than the average coun-
cillor. A full council meeting, in fact, may be
described as the apotheosis of money-grubbing
and slave-driving. The very few broad-minded
citizens who do aspire to what are satirically
termed “ civic honours,” usually get chivied out
of the charming circle by their gibing, jobbing
colleagues. In the hands of these petty despots,
then, it is not surprising that the Victorian Fac-
tories and Shops Act promises to become
a dead letter, unless the faint-hearted em-
ployees who make the money combine to
coerce the full-bodied gentlemen who spend it. In
the city of Melbourne proper the early-closing
clause was promptly suspended on the petition of
what claimed to be a majority of the master
drapers and clothiers. The councillors rubbed
their oily palms together, and granted permission
to these kindred spirits to keep open as long as
they liked on five days of the week and half as
long again on Saturdays. The majority,' cackled
the Argus, were groaning under the yoke of this
hateful Kadi cal act. However, a careful enquiry
into the matter has disclosed the fact that the
petition—eagerly accepted as an excuse for over-
working a few hundred men and girls—was not
signed by a majority of the employers. Something
less than 30 per cent- of them appended their names,
and of these names live were the creation of some
body’s brain. The worthy Mayor and his paunchy
satellites are now busily devising some means of
wriggling out of the present difficulty. With the
help of the Daity and the Argus they intend to
crush the aspiring shop-assistmts, kerhum what
ma-a-y.

were almost unknown on the Australian coasts,
and yet never lost a single life. But were you,
during the'said good old days, ever compelled to

And did you, on arrival in port, after being with-

have to either start right away in her or else risk

nothing of forfeiting your billet altogether ?....

merely because the present dock isn’t big enough

Lord Carington, we understand, is thoroughly
disgusted at the unseemly squabbling which has
taken place over the payment of his reception

heartily congratulating the Evening News upon
the cowardly way in which it has trimmed and
