“Geon” based “Daynide”
has been chosen as the
upholstery material for the
Tierstack seating installed in
the new Member’s Stand at
Moonee Valley Racecourse.
The flexibility of “Geon”
based vinyls assists in
withstanding constant use,
and the “Daynide” is
specially coated to stand up
to occasional exposure to
extremes of temperature and
rain. “Geon” based vinyls
allow a wide range of
upholstery colours, in
attractive combinations
as shown.

“Pan Am’s extra Atlantic and Pacific flights
helped my business trip. In just two weeks I covered
five European cities and the Far East!”
—says Mr. Kenneth Elliott, Shirt Manufacturer, of Melbourne
“I flew from New York and chose
from scores of Pan Am flights, ones
that suited my movements. I’ve
never seen so many flights across
the Atlantic—day and night! It’s
the same across the Pacific! From
Hong Kong I could fly Pan Am
eastwards or westwards around the
world!”
Businessmen fly Pan Am for fast,
convenient business trips. But Pan
Am’s world-wide connections and
choice of flights help tourists too!
With more time to spend in pleasure
spots, there’s no need to rush sight-
seeing to catch flights. On the
ground, or in the air, Pan Am offers
superior airline service all the way.
To plan your itinerary, call Pan
Am or your Pan Am Travel Agent.
They’re ready to help you wherever
you fly. And on Pan Am, you’re
with the world’s best travelling
companion . . . Pan Am’s Priceless
Extra of Experience.
First on the Pacific-
First on the Atlantic...
First in Latin America...
First ’Round the World...
You’re better off with Pan Am—

MASTER-KEYED SYSTEMS
A Master-Keyed System is one in which each
.lock has its own individual key, which oper-
ates that lock only and no other, but where
each lock is also built to a Master-Key which
will open all locks in the group.
Within a Master-Keyed System, if required,
certain locks may be grouped in a section
Keyed-Alike to a given Service-Key, and still
subject to the Master-Key.

GRAND MASTER-KEYED SYSTEM
Each lock has its own individual key which
operates that lock only and no other, but the
locks are divided into two or more groups.
Each group is subject to its own Master-Key,
which opens all locks in that group, but no
other group.
However, all locks are also subject to a
Grand Master-Key which opens all locks in
all groups.
As with Master-Keyed Systems, Keyed-Alike
groups may also be included in G.M.K. Systems.

National Notebook
Tea and Politics
pRiNCE Hubertus zu Lowenstein-Wer-
*■ theim - Freudenberg of the tradi-
tional reigning family of Bavaria in-
sisted on our sharing a cup of tea with
him in the lounge of Sydney’s Australia
Hotel on the occasion of his 58th birth-
day. “It is my pleasure to buy cups of
tea while in the British Commonwealth,”
he said, handing the waitress a tip. “I
do, however, prefer mine black, like
coffee.” Between sips, he talked of Hit-
ler, World War Three, the Common
Market, Quebec Separatists, Dr Aden-
auer, Chancellor Erhard and the British
Elections. Prince Ldwenstein left Ger-
many in 1933 forecasting the ruin of
his country under Hitler. “I thought I
would be away for only six weeks, by
which time I hoped the little monster
would have been finished. I returned
from America 13 years later. I met Hit-
ler once after a youth rally I attended.
He was a disgusting man. Talked
atrocious German with a horrible
accent. Ugh!”
Now a special adviser to the German
Federal Government, Prince Ldwen-
stein describes himself as a public re-
lations man. “I explain Britain to the
Germans and Germany to the Britons.
I am now doing that to the Australians.
Next time I visit this part of the world
I shall stay longer, I hope. There is
much to be said and done here”. Still a
leading supporter of the Christian Demo-
crats, the Prince is gloomy about the
prospects of another world war. “It
could happen. Especially in Europe.
Khrushchev is talking propaganda non-
sense when he says it is only the econ-
omic war he wants to win. Already,
since World War 11, he claims to have
won 70 minor wars. None of them were
economic.”
Former Chancellor Adenauer re-
mains the Prince’s Number One post-
war German. “Such a mild-mannered
man. Never raises his voice. And so
very wise as well as well-mannered. Er-
hard is very promising, too. We have
high hopes in him. We trust him im-
plicitly. If he can equal Adenauer in
stature it will be wonderful for all of
Europe.” Quebec Separatists are dis-
missed by Prince Ldwenstein as “pub-
licity - seeking sensationalists,” though
he worries about Communist influence
on them.
He has more to say about the Com-
mon Market. “We hope to get Britain
in before too long. My grandfather,
Lord Pilbright, had the germ of the
Common Market idea when he was
first secretary to the Board of Trade in
Britain. It is essential to foster it. Of
course, a lot depends on the outcome
of the elections. . . .”
For the Record
11/e learnt from visiting scholar Mr
" George Rylands that the complete
Shakespeare on record fills 139 discs,
each with a playing time of 50 minutes.
So in the time that it would take you
to play them right through (we worked
it out at 4 days, 19 hours, 50 minutes,
and we hope we’re right) you could com-
fortably fly to London, take in Olivier’s
“Othello” and fly back home again.
This point of view is not to deter any-
one from buying Shakespeare records.
According to Mr Rylands, who has spent
most of the last four years supervising
the recordings for the British Council,
Australia is per capita the best buyer
of them. “Most of them go to schools,”
he said. “I suppose it’s because you have
so little theatre here. Most private buy-
ers buy their favorite play or plays. I
suppose nobody would say ‘Lord, I
simply must have “Cymbeline”,’ but
actually the plays that are hard to read
are so much easier to hear.”
Mr Rylands said he had arrived in
Australia “totally exhausted” after join-
ing in the celebrations in Britain of the
400th anniversary of Shakespeare’s birth.
He is a Shakespeare man from way back,
from as far back as 40-odd years ago
when he was a Cambridge undergradu-
ate. Since then he has advanced the
cause on two fronts as a Fellow of
Kings College, Cambridge (the British
Council, which brought him to Australia
for lectures and recitals, refers to him
grandly, if rather tactlessly, as “perhaps
the last of the old dons of the great
Cambridge tradition”) and in the theatre.
During the war he directed Gielgud in
“Hamlet” and “The Duchess of Malfi”
and has since 1936 been associated with
the New Arts Theatre, Cambridge,
which was built by economist Maynard
Keynes.
Having got the Shakespeare record-
ings behind him Mr Rylands is now
working on the series of poetry readings,
from Chaucer to Yeats. But in this the
poets are cut down to sides Words-
worth gets three, Shelley and Keats one.
Most recently he has been doing sections
of Milton with Michael Redgrave as
reader.
The Shakespeare recordings were
undertaken, he said, without much
money. The first recordings were done
in an old building in Cambridge, a
building so ancient that it creaked in
the wind, and with the sounds of Ameri-
can air force planes breaking the sound
barrier overhead. Later they had moved
to Decca studios in London. For the
readings Mr Rylands used some “names”
Gielgud and Ashcroft do Beatrice
and Benedict but most of the readers
were his former students. “First-class
actors are often poor readers, and
second-rate actors can be excellent poetry
readers,” he explained. One economy
was to try to tape thunder during a
storm for “Lear”, but it hadn’t worked.
Bananaland Ballet
When 2000 people cheered its per-
formance in Brisbane's Festival Hall
at the end of the city’s Warana celebra-
tions, the Queensland Ballet Company
felt that at last it had come of age. The
company is the only professional State
company, it seems, in Australia, and its
successful season came only a few weeks
after the Elizabethan’s Australian Ballet
Company had finished a season of not
very good business in Brisbane.
It was the Queensland company’s first
appearance on a big public stage—and
they only just made it. Three weeks
earlier a fire had burned down the com-
pany’s little theatre and taken with it
all the props: costumes, scenery, shoes
and all.
Charles Lisner, who built up the com-
pany from scratch, worked around the
clock organising the making of new cos-
tumes, which included expensive velvets
for “Francesca da Rimini”, and a lot of
tutus, which cost around £3O apiece.
Only a few weeks before, Charles
Lisner had been saying happily, “By
sheer hard work our dancers’ techniques
now need a bigger stage than we have
at the Academy Theatre.” Surveying
the theatre’s charred remains, with
burned ballet shoes floating in turgid
puddles of water from fire hoses, the
wall-sized practice mirror lying in frag-
ments about the wrecked stage, he ad-
mits he had not meant fate to take him
so literally.
Lisner built the theatre with money
raised from classes he started in Bris-
bane 11 years ago. He simply arrived
and put up his shingle. He was then a
dedicated young man of about 25. He
had been in London, dancing at Covent
Garden with Sadler's Wells, now the
Royal Ballet
The Lisner family came to Australia

one computer that's going places
This is the IBM System/360. It was launched on 14th April, 1964 and has met
With instant acceptance among Australia's greatest organisations. Why? Because
it is the product of a dramatic breakthrough in computer technology. It is a single
computer that encompasses the entire range of data processing problems of
commerce, science, engineering, communications and control. It is the greatest
Single advance in the history of IBM Data Processing.

from Paris in 1937 because, Charles
Lisner said, “My parents had seen one
war sweep Europe and they did not want
their children involved in the next one.”
He was nine when they arrived in Mel-
bourne.
His plan when he came to Brisbane
was ambitious. At his HQ in rooms
in Duncan Street, The Valley, he set out
to build a non-profit company that
would employ dancers full-time and let
him create new ballets. The Academy
Theatre opened in 1959. The Lisner
Ballet Company now could give small
seasons in its own home. When it turned
professional two years ago it became the
Queensland Ballet Company, under vice-
regal patronage. Profits are ploughed
back into the company.
The company has five full - time
dancers. As Lisner planned, there is
full-time employment and four weeks’
paid holiday, almost unheard of in ballet
companies. None of the dancers is
under contract. Says Lisner, “They are
free to go. Harold Collins in particular
has had tempting offers. Male dancers
are scarce.” Their devotion to him is
complete. Collins has been there since
the first days.
Valerie Brunne is another of the
original class who is still there. Lisner
married her in 1957. They have two
children, who can take up ballet “if
they choose”. Mrs Lisner takes her
share of classes. The Lisners do not
start children under the age of seven.
The classes are serious and dedicated.
There are no annual concerts with
Little 80-Peep costumes and scamper-
ing fairies and no one on pointes before
ten.
The greatest luxury Charles Lisner
could think of would be another choreo-
grapher. Like comedians’ gag-writers,
they are scarce and expensive. Mean-
while, he is his own choreographer. He
has done 20 new ballets since the com-
pany began, necessarily restricted be-
cause of the limited number of dancers
—2O, including the corps. Lor the same
reason they cannot tackle a full-scale
classical ballet although the repertoire
includes all the great pas de deux and
other classical fragments.
VL2UV
years ago the University of
A NSW decided it had to do something
about what it still refers to as “the
explosion of knowledge” and reach the
swarm of seekers after higher education.
It began by using a scheme so far un-
tried outside the North American con-
tinent. Some old RAAL radio equip-
ment was bought, a makeshift studio
With curtains blanketing extraneous
sounds was built and in 1961 the first
Radio University began broadcasting.
Today the equipment is modern, the
studios equal to any in the ABC and
enrolments have grown from 333 to
more than 3000.
Difficulties of transmission strength,
with resultant limitations in range, and
prohibitions of the Broadcasting Act
are still there. Compared with the
national stations’ 20,000 watts, VL2UV,
as it is known officially, operates on 300
watts. Its wavelength entails conversion
of most sets and it is forbidden to use
music or anything which might clash
with the role of commercial and ABC
radio transmissions.
It does broadcast an impressive list
of series in bridging courses, post-
graduate and extension studies and
graduate studies. How effective this has
been is seen in the response from in-
dividuals, private and public organisa-
tions and many outside the range of the
station to whom tape-recorded versions
of the course are sent. Recently a
request came from Singapore for a
course on the new Companies Act. It
appears that Malaysia is about to enact
legislation similar to this country’s.
Manager of the station, Mr H. G.
“Henry” Morgan, is an engineering and
arts graduate. Head of the division is
Associate Professor Eric Broadbent. “So
far,” Mr Morgan told me, “the station
has not only covered all its expenses,
but we have shown a profit.”
Income is from enrolment fees
usually around £2 a course but not
all who listen are enrolled. The intending
student is sent copious notes on his
subject and informed how to convert
his set. Broadcasts, all of which are
first taped, are made every night in
Sydney. Recently a branch was opened
in Wollongong which operates through
a local station twice a week.
“Some of the courses are really wide
in scope,” Mr Morgan said. “We have
one on automation made with the co-
operation of the United States Informa-
tion Service. This entailed preparation
of a 183-page booklet. Not all are as
extensive, but all are carefully prepared
to be as valuable as possible. The
course on automation has such speakers
as Sol Barkin of the Textile Workers’
Union of the United States speaking on
the challenge automation holds for
labor.
The wide range of subjects in the
Radio University series, which now
number around 50, includes Theatre and
Drama, currently being given by Robert
Quentin and Tom Brown, The Child in
the Home, Radiation and Safety, and
The Problems of Adolescence. The
service also helps students attending
University classes bone up on subjects
on which they need more complete
knowledge or in which they have some
particular weakness.
Obviously dedicated to the idea of
using radio and later television in the
interests of education, Mr Morgan spoke
of the need to make people aware of
what is offering. “The racks are full of
edited tapes that can be sent out to
groups who get together for a particular
study. All they require is a tape recorder
and the very modest fee for enrolment.
We send them the notes and they take
it from there.”
THE MOUNT RENNIE GANG RAPE
ffij^ulLetCn
78 Years Ago: December 4, 1886.
VTine human dingoes have been
’ found guilty of glutting their foul
appetites on one miserable little girl.
The evidence against the majority of
them placed their complicity in the
crime beyond the region of doubt,
and the verdict [guilty] eminently satis-
factory to those of the general public
who have ventured to read the re-
volting record of proceedings in Court.
But though the result of the trial will
receive public approbation, it is im-
possible that some of its un-British
incidents can escape the strongest
censure.
On Saturday night the prisoners
passed out of the Judge’s control; their
fate then rested with the Executive
Council. [Judge Windeyer had sen-
tenced them all to death.] But while
their case was still sub judice as far as
the latter body was concerned, the
daily papers of Sydney did not hesi-
tate to endeavor to prejudice that
decision by publishing bloodthirsty
leaders invoking the full penalty of the
law against the men. It is an anomal-
ous thing that this should be per-
mitted. If one of these papers had
ventured to publish such articles while
the case was before a jury, they would
certainly have been fined; but when
the lives of the same criminals depend
upon the decision of a Council which
in at least all other matters is strongly
susceptible to popular influence, the
floodgates of sentiment are opened
and a torrent of argument, invective
and appeal pours upon the Executive.
It is a disgrace to the Australian politi-
cal system that the lives of men under
capital sentences are made the shuttle-
cock of political parties, and a thing
to be openly wrangled over by hysteri-
cal newspapers and designing politi-
cians.

PLAIN ENGLISH
Mr Wilsons Promises
Tt/fR Harold Wilson’s victory in the
UK general election will arouse
more concern in Australia than a
Labor win under the late Mr Hugh
Gaitskell would have done, even if
only because British Labor has always
been a party with guts that tries to
deliver what it has promised, however
much one may dislike the promises.
Assuming Mr Wilson’s narrow major-
ity allows him to govern, at least for
a while, his domestic promises are of
no direct concern to Australians, but
his foreign policy certainly is.
The most worrying is the probable
policy of the new Government in
Asia. First, the Labor Government
is likely to work actively to bring Red
China into its “proper place” in the
United Nations in contrast to the
Conservative policy of merely voting
perfunctorily for China’s admission.
This in itself would represent a great
success for China’s diplomacy and en-
courage pro - Communist forces
throughout Asia. Secondly, however
committed British Labor is officially
to the idea of the British Common-
wealth, a Labor Government is likely
to be cooler than the Conservatives
about British military commitment to
Malaysia. Any British cut-back here
would not only doom the Malaysian
idea but, by encouraging US advo-
cates of withdrawal from South Viet-
nam, could dramatically increase Aus-
tralia’s insecurity.
More generally, we can reasonably
expect an increasing tension between
Britain and America. Labor directly
opposes the US policy of making
West Germany a full military partner
in the Western alliance and of re-
unifying Germany. Mr Wilson may
even favor an agreement with the
Soviet Union to keep Germany div-
ided in order to protect “common in-
terests” and may therefore recognise
East Germany. He also advocates a
Central European “nuclear-free zone”,
which would certainly weaken West
Germany.
Mr Wilson has also opposed the
BS plan for a “mixed-manned”
nuclear fleet in Western Europe as
“provocative” to the Russians and
opposes British participation in any
plan for European unity. One pro-
gramme in Labor circles is an
arrangement with France whereby
Britain stays out of any European
union but receives preferential trade
treatment from the Common Market
a plan that would surely sour
Anglo-American relations and have
economic dangers for Australia.
New governments, of course, often
turn out to be more conservative
than they promised to be, especially
one with a tiny majority, but, in the
case of British Labor, it would be
foolish to rely on this. Whatever
genuine reforms it may or may not
launch within Britain, its foreign
policies offer little basis for optimism.
Probably the most internationally
A famous speaker at this week’s
Communist-front Peace Congress in
Sydney is Dr Linus Pauling, the
American scientist who has twice had
the Nobel Prize. On his arrival at
Mascot, Sydney, last week he nat-
urally enough ridiculed the foolish
and unnecessary decision of the Fed-
eral Government to refuse visas to
the Mayor of Leningrad and Arch-
bishop Alexei of the Russian Ortho-
dox Church. But he then went on to
say: “Any congress that wants to be
dominated by Communists had better
not invite my wife and me . . .
In the last decade and a half, when
I or anyone else talked about inter-
national co-operation and peace, we
were attacked for being Communist
or pro-Communist.”
No one doubts Dr Pauling’s siq-
cerity or his scientific ability. The
point, however, is that he has been
the most outstanding scientist in every
major Communist “Peace” front in
the United States since World War 11.
He is the very model of the fellow-
traveller, of the type who willingly
adds respectability to Communist
frauds. He signs Communist petitions,
he speaks from Communist platforms,
he has his speeches published by
Communist Presses. He has, however,
never been heard to say one word of
criticism of the Soviet Union, of
Soviet terrorism, or of the lack of
freedom for Soviet scientists, although
he “has the honor” to be a member of
the Soviet Academy of Sciences
which, as an instrument of the Soviet
Communist Party, has purged many
scientists “guilty” of free inquiry
and although he was also vice-presi-
dent, under the Communist F. Joliot-
Curie, of the World Federation of
Scientists. While he has criticised
most American actions against Soviet
But Not Dr Pauling
war-mongering, including American
policy towards Cuba, he found no
occasion to criticise Mr Khrushchev’s
placing of missiles on Cuba. He
sponsored a conference in sup-
port of the American atomic spies,
Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, and
organised a Soviet-inspired petition
to the United Nations in 1957-58
against nuclear tests without any refer-
ence to inspection safeguards, at a time
when the Soviet Union opposed even
token inspection.
At the 1960 World Congress against
A and H bombs in Tokyo, British and
German delegates and genuine pacifists
from many countries walked out in
protest at the Communist manipula-
tion of the Congress but not Dr
Pauling. In 1960, too, the Sane
Nuclear Policy in America purged
itself of Communists, who had heavily
infiltrated the Policy—but Dr Pauling
resigned in protest and spoke at public
meetings in support of the Com-
munists. In Sydney, one can be
absolutely confident that if any of the
non-Communists attending this week’s
Conference walk out in disgust at the
Communist manipulation they must
surely witness, Dr Pauling will not
walk out in protest but will stay on to
defend the Communist organisers.
It is clear from the record that if Dr
Pauling does not seek out Communists
to offer his support, they certainly
seek him out and use him freely. This
does not make him a conscious agent
of Communist imperialism, but it
means that his stature as a scientist
is totally irrelevant to his stature as
a political commentator. Politically he
cannot be taken seriously except as a
dangerous man who, naively or other-
wise, is doing his best to help those
world powers that are the most
immediate threats to world peace and
freedom.


THIS AUSTRALIA
Is Sir Robert Tiring?
The warhorse’s last gallop?
J. RENSHAW
SIR ROBERT MENZIES
From ALAN REID in Canberra
fTTiE December 5 Senate election could
see Australia’s outstanding political
warhorse in his last dramatic gallop.
The warhorse Prime Minister Sir
Robert Menzies is a veteran per-
former, scarred from innumerable
battles, undefeated since 1949 and still
the undisputed champion of the Federal
arena.
Currently the possibility of the depar-
ture of the veteran from the political
scene he has dominated so masterfully
and overwhelmingly for so long is be-
ing discussed. This in itself is not im-
portant. It is always being discussed.
When Menzies drops out of politics the
gap will be as large as his stature, and
he is a big man. But there are features
to the present discussions that mark
them as different from the usual idly
speculative discussions with which minor
politicians beguile their time.
These discussions are not taking place
between minor politicians. They are
taking place between men more con-
cerned with practical possibilities than
with speculation. These men are not
guessing in a random fashion about the
shape of things to come. They believe
that a shape could be starting to emerge
already.
Furthermore, their discussions con-
cern not what may happen some time
in the future but what may happen in
the early part of next year.
There are things happening to Sir
Robert’s health that suggest he could
be considering departing public life once
he has moved into his seventieth year.
He will be 70 on December 20 this year.
There are also things happening in
politics to support the possibility of Sir
Robert's departure.
He has reached a unique position in
Australian public life. He has held the
Prime Ministership for a record period.
In spite of his long years in office, the
electors in 1963 gave him a huge
majority to carry on for another three
years. He dominated the Liberal Party
and consequently the Liberal-Country
Party Coalition Government over
which he has presided since 1949 so
completely that if ever he decides to
move out it will be because of his own
decision, or at the behest of the voters
at an election. He is unshakeable within
the Government and has another two
years to run before his majority in the
House of Representatives could be re-
duced by the electors. On previous form
he could expect a further three years in
office even when those elections come
around.
But there is evidence that the war-
horse is tiring. This has manifested
itself in two ways over recent months.
On the personal side his health has not
been as good as it once was. Though the
doctors repeat that there is nothing
really serious about his illnesses (the
present is stated to be only a cold) the
fact is that he has had to absent himself
from his desk four times since he defied
his doctors’ orders in June this year.
Also, worried about Australia’s isolation
in an area of the world in which omin-
ous signs of tension were showing up,
he flew to Washington to see President
Johnson and on to London to partici-
pate in wearying, difficult talks at the
Commonwealth Prime Ministers’ Con.
ference.
The miracle is not that he has
occasionally been sick recently. It is
that he has been so well in view of the
exhausting programme into which hi
immediately plunged on his return fron
abroad and from which he has yet not
let up. He is a man with a stronge sensi
of duty who drives himself remorse
lessly. In the last few weeks he has been
in Adelaide one night, Perth the next
in Sydney the next and so on, carrying
commitments that would leave men hall
his years physically spent and exhausted
It would seem that Sir Robert is moving
to a point where he will have to con-
sider quitting or cutting down on the!
number of his commitments.
However, he may decide to carry onl
and to cut down on the number of his
commitments. This would be quite
proper. Other Prime Ministers before
him have followed this policy when they,
found the strain beginning to tell as in-1
evitably it must. But Sir Robert takes
the view that the nation’s leader is not
only an administrator: he must also be
the man who is available to grace im-
portant functions and to give to the sec-
tions of the community that are looking
for guidance and advice the benefit d
his experience and views. If he finds he
has to limit his activities in these direc-
tions, Sir Robert could well use this as
a justification to make a decision on
whether he should or should not carry i
on in his present post.
HPhe tiredness that inevitably accompan-j
ies illness in the years when you are
no longer young and resilient enough
to shrug it off overnight has manifested
itself politically since Sir Robert’s re-
turn from his June journey abroad. The'
Government's sense of timing has uih
doubtedly gone off in recent months
No Government could have won the
debate on The Voyager. When a war-
ship is sunk in an accident no legerde
main can transform the tragedy into ii
triumph. But the debate was badly mis- !
handled. Virtually taking the attitude
that the Opposition had no right to ques-
tion naval administration and the Gov-
ernment's responsibility for it, the
Government offered itself almost maso-
chistically for more wounds than it
need have sustained.
In my view, a less tired Menzies
would never have permitted Cabinet k
make the decision that probably did
more to get a catastrophically hostile!
vote for Victorian Liberal premier Bolte
in the recent by-election for the Vic-
torian Upper House. Admittedly, when
Cabinet decided that the Commonwealtl
would not co-operate with Victoria t«


collect the Victorian State Income Tax
which Bolte had announced, his budget
Cabinet did not announce the decision
publicly. The decision “leaked”.
But Sir Robert is no dewy-eyed
novice in politics. He knew what was
at stake for Bolte and that if Bolte lost
the by-election he would lose control of
the Victorian Upper House and be left
in a position in which a combination of
hostile Country Party - ALP forces
could send him to the voters at a time
when his political stocks were depressed.
Sir Robert normally would have defer-
red the decision until after the by-elec-
tion and thereby eliminated any pros-
pects of a “leak”. But the decision was
taken and Bolte’s prospects of winning
the by-election disappeared.
Tiredness must also have contributed
to the timing of the decision to take
Commonwealth control of intra - state
airlines. The aviation dogfight in
NSW had been going on for a long
time with the Renshaw Labor Govern-
ment backing East-West Airlines against
Airlines of NSW (an Ansett subsidiary)
in the reallocation of State air routes.
The Commonwealth was dragged into
it, only indirectly, not by its own
action but by a court decision which
said almost in passing that the Com-
monwealth had power over intra-state
air routes as well as interstate air routes.
Superficially there was no political
reason for Sir Robert and his ministers
to rush into the fray. They could have
stayed out and considered their position
until the dogfight was decided, leaving
Mr Renshaw (who also has an election
coming up) to carry any embarrassment
that might accrue from an arbitrary use
of power to strengthen one non-Govern-
ment, profit-making organisation against
another non-Government, profit-making
organisation.
The Commonwealth had not exer-
cised control over intra-state air routes
for decades. It could have gone along
for a few months more, preparing its
position and case more adequately
than its parliamentary presentation sug-
gests it has, without anyone being in a
position to accuse it of dragging its feet.
Instead, the Menzies Government
bought into the fight and, as so often
happens when the former bystander
intervenes, it is the intervenor who is
now on the defensive and who might
now suffer in the disappearance of pros-
peets of a Senate seat in NSW.
There are other examples of how
the Government’s timing has been off
recently . . . Menzies could recover of
course. He is a master at plucking a
win from seeming defeat. Though his
physical resilience is obviously not what
it was, his political resilience is extra-
ordinary. But there are those who be-
lieve that the Senate elections par-
ticularly if he pulls them off brilliantly
against the odds that probably his tired-
ness has done as much as anything to
build up could be by choice the last
trophy that he will add to his impres-
sive political collection. Years ago he told
a Press conference at which I was
present: “I would not like to be in poli-
tics much after seventy.”
The next few months and probably
the outcome of the Senate elections be-
cause he undoubtedly would prefer to
depart in triumph rather than after a
setback will be decisive. Menzies has
a deep regard for proprieties. If he de-
cides to pull out before the next House
of Representatives election he would un-
doubtedly do so early next year so as
to give his successor a period in which
to establish himself as a national leader
before the elections that are due in 1966.
VICTORIA
Why Bolte Lost
Country Party victory
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
Although its candidate polled only
11,000 of the 138,000 votes in the
much-publicised South Eastern Province
by-election and seemed likely to lose
his deposit, the G. C. Moss’s Country
Party early last week claimed a victory.
It believed that by recommending no pre-
ferences, it ensured a sufficient leakage
to ALP candidate, Cathie, to ensure his
defeat of the Bolte Government's candi-
date.
An ALP win will make the num-
bers in the Legislative Council 17 all,
and restore to the Country Party the
balance of power position it had used
G. C. MOSS
as a whip over the Bolte Government
for the past nine years. CP leaders
made it clear that this had been their
object in the by-election, and firmly dis-
claimed any intention of joining the
ALP to refuse Supply in the Upper
House and force a general State election.
The result was a bitter blow for
Henry Bolte. Gaining an 18-16 major-
ity in the Upper House in the June
election, he had looked forward to pass-
ing contentious legislation previously
held up by the Country Party, notably
on redistribution and traffic offences.
He had prepared the unpopular kind of
Budget, which a Premier only risks
when he thinks he has three years be-
'fore facing electoral retribution. To be
plunged into a by-election was a catas-
trophe.
In the by-election, nobody could ac-
cuse the Liberals of political finesse.
There was little serious effort to combat
the ALP’s claim that the Budget meant
a double tax assessment and double tax.
The backing and filling between Menzies
and Bolte on income tax was most
damaging. The Premier’s TV session
was obviously prepared in advance of
important later developments and lost
thereby. It was a poor campaign.
The DLP lost ground and ascribed
H. BOLTE
the losses to: the appearance of a
Country Party candidate for the first
time in 15 years; to resentment among
its rank and file at the Bolte Budget;
and to its not using TV since it had to
conserve its finances for the Senate elec-
tion. The Country Party, which will
not have a candidate in the Senate
election, spent lavishly on TV.
ALP leaders, Stoneham and Calwell,
claimed a great swing to Labor, but the
Labor Hour, more modestly and realis-
tically admitted that the people voted
as they did, because “their pockets were
hurt”. Still the result must have made
the Menzies Cabinet have second
thoughts about the Senate election.

BETTER BUJLT -BETTER BACKED
COMMUNISTS
The “Notorious Man”
Laurie Carmichael's methods
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
T aurie Carmichael, secretary of the
Melbourne district of the Amal-
gamated Engineering Union, and a key
figure in recent Victorian strikes, would
lose no sleep over the bitter attack made
on him by Federal Minister for Labor,
Bill McMahon. On October 14, in the
House of Representatives, McMahon
called Carmichael “a notorious Com-
munist and one of the most evil men
in the trade union movement in Vic-
toria”.
A dedicated Communist for 20 years,
Carmichael came up through a nursery
for more than a few well-known com-
rades, the Shop Committee at Williams-
town Naval Dockyard. Communists have
been freely employed at the dockyard
for years, yet a few weeks ago a party
of high-school girls sketching nearby
were interrogated by security men and
their drawings confiscated.
Carmichael won the secretaryship of
the key Melbourne branch about six
years ago. He owed much to the power-
ful support of W. Butler, a member of
the Victorian ALP Executive and a dele-
gate to the ALP Federal Conference,
who justified his backing by claiming
politics should not enter into union elec-
tions.
Carmichael’s determination and dedi-
cation led the Communist Party to ap-
point him leader of its forces on Mel-
bourne Trades Hall Council, when, some
time ago, former leader Clarrie O'Shea
of the Tramways Union defected to
Ted Hill s pro - Chinese Communist
breakaway group.
Carmichael has been prominent some-
where in nearly every big Victorian
strike this year and is a particular thorn
in the sides of the Australian Council
of Trade Unions and Melbourne Trades
Hall leaderships for his adept manipula-
tion of disputes started at the shop com-
mittee level. The ACTU has thundered
in vain against such undisciplined stop-
pages, and Federal Minister McMahon
might have been echoing opinions held
about Carmichael in some ACTU
quarters.
W. McMAHON
L. CARMICHAEL
The Carmichael formula has been:
• Stoppages called by shop commit-
tees, in particular workshops or
factories.
• Broadening of the stoppages to
large proportions, justifying refer-
ence of the dispute to the Trades
Hall Disputes Committee.
This committee consists of half a
dozen Trades Hall officials plus two from
each union involved. As Carmichael has
the numbers on the Disputes Committee,
reference of a dispute to it, in effect,
places it in the hands of Carmichael and
the Communist Party. It is noticeable
at committee meetings that at each
move all eyes turn to him and he issues
the orders quietly but without conceal-
ment. He has claimed credit for the
stoppages which extracted £2.6 million
from the Bolte Government for incre-
ments and service grants.
Although his union has a minority
of members involved in the GM-H
strike, Carmichael took it over early
in the piece. He broadened it from
a dispute on wages in the foundry sec-
tion, on which the firm says it was
prepared to negotiate, to a general
demand for a £3 a week increase.
To cut off rank and file moves for
a return to work, he manipulated
committal of the strike to his pet
body, the Trades Hall Disputes Com-
mittee. The moderate leaders of the
Vehicle Builders' Union, whose members
are mainly involved, then referred the
dispute, when it became Federal by other
States being involved, to the ACTU to
get it out of Carmichael's hands. But
he was still sitting pretty.
Albert Monk and the ACTU, so often
jeeringly referred to by the Reds as
the “graveyard of strikes”, could not
afford to send the men back to work
empty-handed. The contrast with Car-
michael's gains from the fight against
Bolte would be too great.
Hence the ACTU had to keep the
strike going until GM-H became more
complaisant, which suited the Commun-
ists. Then, if anvt’nina were gained, they
could claim the credit for Carmichael’s
original militancy.
The undoubted arguments GM-H
workers have for better conditions, in
the light of the company’s flourishing
profits, cannot obscure the ugly fact that
capitulations by the Bolte Government
early in 1964 to State Electricity work-
ers and recently to other State workers
could deal the Arbitration system a
crushing blow.

will serve three purposes. First, it will
increase production facilities, already

The whole of the British and Ameri-
can motor industry in Australia is con-
cerned about the influx of lapanese
cars on the home market but particu-
larly BMC which, because of the types
of car it produces, is probably the most
affected of the big three.
Managing Director of BMC in Aus-
tralia, Mr Bill Abbott, told The
Bulletin that the threat of Japanese
imports had not played a major part
in deciding the expansion about . 18
months ago. However, since then, the
growth of these imports had shown the
need to be in a more competitive posi-
tion.
The £7 million will be spent over the
next four years in Sydney, Melbourne
and Brisbane. Mr Abbott said half
would be spent on buildings, plant and
equipment and the rest on tooling to
increase the local content of the Morris
850 (Mini Minor) and 1100 series to
about 95 p.c.
Increasing the local content to about
90-95 p.c. will enable BMC to compete
more effectively not only in range and
styles but also in price. Its newest
model, the Morris 1100, is about 67 p.c,
Australian content. The popular Mor-
ris 850 is about 58 p.c. Most of the
foreign content is engines and engine
parts. j
BMC also said it would add another
car, the Morris 1800, to its range in
late 1965 or early 1966. Here again
is another counter to the Japanese,
Modelled on the successful Morris 1100
lines the 1800 could pose a threat to the
Holden. Initially it will have about 45
p.c. local content but the company
plans to raise this as quickly as possible.
SOUTH AFRICA
The Sachs Case
Does he fit the bill?
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
T istening to Mr E. S. (Solly) Sachs at
the Assembly Hall, Melbourne, the
other night one had to remember he
came here by invitation of the local South
Africa protest, not of his own accord. In
all senses he was an invited guest. It
was left to the others like Labor Senator
S. H. Cohen, QC, and Dr A. R. de
Crespigny, Lecturer in Politics at Mon-
ash University, and a former South
African, to do the hot-gospelling and to
S. SACHS
B. SNEDDEN
the waterside workers and clergy in the
audience to do most of the cheering (nd
that it was very loud or brave).
If there was a Left-wing feelirig about
the whole affair, Mr Sachs, wearing a'
bright red tie for the occasion, behavecl
in a most exemplary manner, hardly men-
tioning the question of the money foil
South Africa protest which the organisers
were keenly interested in, and in no way
giving the idea that anything more than
social justice for the oppressed colored
people in South Africa was involved.
Yet compared, say, with his TV appear-j
ance on his arrival at Essendon Airport
when Sachs gave a striking impression
of fervency and freshness in a mannei
which could have got most of the coun-
try behind him, here at the Assembly
Hall it was quite different.
He seemed to be struggling all the

time to put across a poorly documented
case; even if very genuine, his references
to oppression in South Africa were
pathetically out of date (he hasn’t been
there for thirteen years) and his emotions
got the better of them in their recital.
One was not alone in getting the im-
pression he was putting on an act, which
those close to him told me was simply
not so. Apparently he has been over-
whelmed by his reception here, particu-
larly by the wharfies, who have even
gone on strike for his cause. On the
platform he has suffered from anti-
climax.
Sachs is hypersensitive to the talk
about his still being a Communist or
that his anti-apartheid blasts and the
campaign for sanctions against South
Africa are in any way connected with
possible designs the Communist coun-
tries may have in Africa. On the other
hand he seems in no way apologetic on
the score of his former Communist affili-
ations, even if his publicists themselves
don’t mention them.
Their emphasis is more on his work
as General Secretary of the Garment
Workers of South Africa from 1928,
when he sought to abolish discrimina-
tion between whites and non-whites, his
25 years on the South Africa Trade and
Labor Council and as treasurer of the
South African Labor Party and workers’
delegate to the International Labor
Organisation in the early post-war years.
As an opponent of apartheid from the
beginning Solly had to defend himself
41 times in South African courts until
he was virtually banned from the country
and sought refuge in Britain.
Today he gives the appearance of the
research worker suddenly summoned
from the cloisters, expected to fill the
role of brilliant propagandist. Some-
how he doesn’t quite fill the bill.
Sincerity and dedication are sometimes
not enough to sway an apathetic world,
even if Hannan Swaffer once saw Sachs
as “a brave crusader who, in his unre-
lenting fight for the underdog, has de-
fied tyranny and risked both life and
liberty”.
iy|EANwhile in the Federal Parliament,
the Attorney-General, Mr B. M.
Snedden, referred to the case of Sachs
and Dupreez (reported in South African
law reports, Witwatersrand Division,
1946). Snedden told the House that Cal-
well had objected to his statement that
Sachs had sworn in evidence that he was
a Communist.
He said: “I quote the following pass-
age from the judgment of the trial judge
on that occasion—‘The plaintiff in evid-
ence admitted that he was a Communist.
... I am thus of the opinion that the
plaintiff not only spread Communism but
that by making use of the “Garment
Worker” for that purpose he did so
improperly’.” (The “Garment Worker”
was the official organ of the Garment
Workers’ Union of which Sachs was the
secretary.)
When Calwell asked Snedden if the
case he had referred to was the same
one in which Sachs received £3OO dam-
ages and in which those who maligned
him had to pay £ll,OOO in costs, Sned-
den said the damages award was £3OO
but he had no way of knowing the
amount of the costs.
Just before awarding the damages the
trial judge had said of Sachs: “He was
untruthful when he stated that South
Africa was not in his opinion ripe for
sowing the seeds of Communism. He
was not candid in explaining his change
of front in regard to the war when
Soviet Russia became one of the allies.
He made improper use of the ‘Garment
Worker’ for the purpose of spreading
Communism.”
WESTERN AUSTRALIA
Multi-Murderer
The silence of
the Anti-Hanging Committee
FROM A PERTH CORRESPONDENT
Western Australians have shown
any enthusiasm to fight to save
multi-murderer Eric Edgar Cook from
hanging in Fremantle Prison at 8 a.m.
on October 26. David Brand’s Govern-
ment believes: “Justice should be allow-
ed to take its course.”
Anti-capital punishment principles by
the public have been over-ridden by the
E. E. COOK
D. BRAND
residue of fear that Cook spread over
Perth for eight months last year, and
compassion for this pathetic hare-lipped
man, for years a burglar and peeping-
tom before he finally became a mur-
derer, cannot stand up to other emotions
of the case. There is more than a
sneaking suspicion that Cook is insane,
but even the Anti-Hanging Committee,
that rallied at the time of Brian Robin-
son’s execution for shooting a policeman,
has shunned this issue.
Lawyer - politician John Wheeldon,
chairman of this group, says: “It is
difficult to argue merits of the abolition
of capital punishment when people are
pointing to a specific case. We are not
leading a campaign for Cook, for we
cannot hope to save him. But we are
resolved to continuing the campaign
against capital punishment.”
The dilemma of Western Australians
is articulated by Rev. Ernest Gundry
Anglican chaplain to Robinson during

the few days before he hung a
man whose indictment of hanging and
the primitive Fremantle Prison caused
a great deal of heart-searching. Rev.
Gundry said: “If there is a case for capi-
tal punishment, this is one. This man is
a pathological case and a complete mass
of spiritual corruption. If there was any
reasonable prospect given, even over an
indefinite period, of some kind of
rehabilitation, then I would be sure
hanging was wrong. But I’m not sure this
may not be the merciful thing. The other
side of the argument in total effect is
the carrying out of such a sentence.
The closer you are to it, the more foul it
becomes. Hanging has a huge effect
on those immediately concerned, apart
from morbid excitement it creates in
vast numbers of people.”
The Cook case goes back to 1958
when divorcee Pnena Berkman was
butchered in a South Perth flat. Cook
also confessed to the murder of society
heiress Jillian Brewer, also butchered in
a flat at Cottesloe, but deaf-mute Darryl
Beamish failed to prove his innocence
of this murder in a High Court appeal.
Similarly, Cook failed to convince the
court that he, not John Button, ran down
and killed Rosemary Anderson, 17,
Button's girl-friend.
Weeks of fear began on the night of
January 26 last year when Cook shot
and killed student John Sturkey, 18, in
bed. The same night, George Walmsley,
55, went to the door in answer to a
knock in the middle of the night and
was shot dead. Two people in a car
were wounded. Accountant Brian Weir,
29, had a vital part of his brain shot
away. Several weeks later the strangled
body of a Native Welfare Officer, Lucy
Madrill, 24, was found near a West
Perth flat. In August, Shirley McLeod,
18, university student, was shot dead
while baby-sitting.
Cook was arrested on September 1,
after an old couple had found a hidden
rifle. Police booby-trapped it and grab-
bed Cook when he returned for it in
the middle of the night. He was sen-
tenced to death in November for the
Sturkey murder.
ON THE WATERFRONT
Lonely Court
Useless solutions
FROM J. C. HORSFALL IN MELBOURNE
Tt all made the Arbitration Commission
look a lonely and academic rallying-
ground for industrial causes: The absence
of a ready-made channel for immediate
negotiation on an industrial dispute in
one industry—automobiles; the failure
of an experiment to establish effective
channels in another—stevedoring; and
Parliamentary taunts about the over-
riding influence of Communist leaders of
key unions.
For while the ACTU and General
Motors-Holden’s were waiting for some-
body to put a negotiating table between
them, and the Government was showing
reluctance to try for a settlement of the
motor workers’ strike, the Australian
Stevedoring Industry Authority reported
that the Industrial Relations Committees
set up last year by an agreement between
employers and waterside workers and
now operating in 26 major Australian
ports had proved worse than useless in
settling industrial disputes on the water-
front.
With the Authority taking this view the
whole arrangement looks to be in jeo-
pardy. The agreement can be abrogated
by either of the parties on one month's
notice from the 12th of next month.
“There is little to indicate,” stated the
Authority in round terms, that “the
Committees are fulfilling the role en-
visaged for them. There is no evidence
that they have had any significant in-
fluence in reducing the incidence of dis-
putes on the waterfront or in improving
the overall standard of industrial rela-
tions. In some ports, it appears that the
functioning of the Committees has had an
adverse effect on efficiency in the in-
dustry. Criticism of their operation is
widespread among representatives of
Employers and of the Federation at the
port level.”
At the time the agreement to set the
committees in motion at all Australian
ports was signed last year the Waterside
Workers’ Federation gave notice that
nothing in it abrogated its right to take
strike action when “the Federation or
a branch decides as a matter of prin-
ciple that it has no other alternative.”
This reduced to patent ineffectiveness
Clause 7 of the agreement which states:
“once a matter has been brought to the
attention of the authorised representatives
of the parties or the industrial relations
committee, work shall continue without
interruption, in accordance with the
award, but subject to the protective

clauses of the award until a decision has
been reached either by the representatives
of the parties, the Industrial Relations
Committee or the Board of Reference,
which decision shall be acted upon by all
concerned.”
Despite the conflict between this clause
and the Federation’s reservation, the
Minister for Labor, Mr W. McMahon,
still apparently held out high hopes of
good results when he said last December
that “provided all parties are prepared
to bring their problems to the Commit-
tees with a spirit of tolerance, a willing-
ness to see each other’s points of view
and a determination that reason and
common sense will prevail”. The hopes
proved pious. “The main reason for
the lack of success,” states the Authority,
“is the failure on the part of members
of the Federation to observe Clause 7
of the agreement.” They had given
firm notice of their intentions.
In the result, in the 253 recorded dis-
putes in the port of Sydney between 11th
December and lune 30 this year work
ceased 222 times and resumed on the
same shift on only 93 of them. In Mel-
bourne the incidence of stoppages was
even worse, 146 disputes over a similar
period and 142 stoppages, work being re-
sumed on the same shift on 108 occa-
sions.
While the Authority says there have
even been stoppages in protest against the
Industrial Relations Committee decisions
and procedures, it blames both sides for
the generally sorry performance. Late
arrivals of members at meetings, un-
availability of authorised representatives
of the parties, by-passing of the com-
mittees, and a general lack of confidence
in the committees with each side fixing
the responsibility on the shoulders of
the other, all contributed. “In Sydney,” it
states, “when disputes occur after 5 p.m.
on an ordinary working day or at any
time at the weekend, the Federation rep-
resentatives will not attend.”
The existence of the Committee has
even undermined the position of port
inspectors, the report says. “In the past
when a dispute occurred on a job, the
general practice was to telephone for a
port inspector whose opinion was accep-
ted on the majority of occasions. Since
the Committees commenced to function
there has been a tendency on the part
of some job delegates at the ports to
resent and object to the presence of the
port inspectors at jobs and to refuse to
have any dealings with them.” The Com-
mittees’ only important success men-
tioned by the Authority is the settlement
of a dispute in Sydney over the loading
of bales of wool.

FROM DISCUS
rpms is the week of the might-have-
been, the week the athletes and
officials return from Tokyo, the reporters
ask pertinent questions, and the answers
sort out the wise, the foolish and the
arrogant.
Some of the officials will say that their
team did its best under the circum-
stances; some will describe things they
have learned and mention the improve-
ments that can be made; others will
blame everyone in sight; and some with
tight mouths will forget they had their
hands out to the public two months ago
and will snap, “No comment”.
The Dawn Fraser issue will be given
further airings. Will the Swimming Union
discipline her? She was both the heroine
and, as the officials and some sports
writers see it, the black sheep of the
Games. She broke rules and set a bad
D. FRAZER with I. KONRADS
example for the young swimmers. One
Sydney sports column has already con-
demned her.
Dawn Fraser broke a possibly well-
intended but fatheaded rule that all
swimmers competing during the next two
days must miss the march and stay away
from the opening ceremony. She
marched, and two other girls saw the
ceremony, seated. Most of the Ameri-
can girls were in the stands, with no
visible effects on their performances.
No one bothered to recall that Dawn
Fraser has given to swimming more than
20 officials and rule makers could in 20
years. This year, almost alone, with
Murray Rose excluded, she is Australian
swimming to the rest of the world. Most
of us would not care if she broke a few
minor rules along the way.
But, as has happened before, the Swim-
ming Union will demand an apology from
her, regardless of the fact that the Union
has more trouble than most other sports
put together, and that there must be a
reason for that.
There is one basic reason. Most swim-
mers are children. Most of the time they
are guided by their coaches. Every few
years, during a Commonwealth or Olym-
pic Games, they come under the strict
parental control of the officials. The
coaches know they must allow for tem-
perament in hard working athletes. The
swimming officials will never do so.
Their intelligent attitude can be sum-
med up in the remark of one gentleman
that Dawn Fraser signed an agreement
to observe the two-days rule, and if she
had objected to it she should have with-
drawn from the team.
In few sports do the competitors vote
to elect the State and Australian officials.
Only other officials have the vote. This
can lead to both an entrenched clique and
a high degree of power. In most sports
this power is exercised sensibly, but not
in all.
Watch and listen to the officials’ com-
ments this week. They will be excellent
guides to some of the many things wrong
in amateur sport in Australia.


Around Melbourne
A CENTURY COULD BE JUST AROUND THE BEND
I>ack on July 14, the date of our
44th derailment for 1964, Mr Bolte
said that he had every confidence in
the Victorian railways. “Indeed,”
said he, “they are the best in the
world! At the time there was con-
siderable doubt as to whether we
would score a century of derailments
for the year, we were making barely
six derailments a month. Since then
we have picked up magnificently and
now, to coin a phrase, we should bolt
it in. Just as we were going to press
there were three in one day, at 8 a.m.,
9 a.m. and 10 a.m., to bring the
year’s total of 85.
That night the Labor and Country
Party Opposition launched a censure
motion, a dull and unrewarding
affair. Mr Meagher, the Transport
Minister, pointed out that we had
only one derailment for every nine
million miles travelled, then he came
out with one beautiful line which
should always be preserved in the
cutting books: “In 1962-63 the miles
covered by the railways increased in
‘leaps and bounds’ to over 207 mil-
lion truck miles.” The Country
Party called for an open inquiry into
the railways but they have no chance
of getting it.
What’s really wrong with the Vic-
torian railways?
Back in 1949 the Hollway Govern-
ment brought out Mr John Elliot,
now Sir John Elliot, the British
transport expert. He said the main
thing wrong with the Victorian Rail-
ways was politics. In his report he
wrote that the VR suffered from “all
the frustrating defects of a machine
bound hand and foot by parliament”.
And be said it was fantastic that a
railway should have to provide cheap
ra t e s to the various sections of the
community as an obvious subsidy. If
the Government wanted to subsidise
the wheat grower, then it should pay
the casb direct to the farmer. The
result was > he said > “muddled eco-
nom y atld a semi-bankrupt transport
system”. In his opinion the VR
should be ab!e to run lts own affairs
of politics, like the SEC.
Now 15 years later the situation is
beautifully unchanged. According to
the last annual report the railways
were carrying superphosphate at an
average of 2.14 d. a ton mile, barley
at 2.86 d., wheat at 3.34 d., and oats
at 3.43 d. These are fantastically
cheap prices, rates which would
barely pay for the axle grease. Mr
Bolte, though, wouldn't dare to put
the goods traffic on true paying prices
for fear upsetting the country vote,
and in particular the Country Party,
which has now won back the balance
®f power in the Upper House,
Meanwhile, the bankrupt railways go
short of £96 million, to pay for the
tyP e of modern railway trucks needed
to sto P 100 derailments a year,
Ar W private organisation can pay

The Rape Cult
Like the Bourbons , learning nothing , forgetting nothing...
By GORDON HAWKINS
(Senior Lecturer in Criminology, University of Sydney)
In 1886 when 15 youths raped a
16-year-old girl at Mount Rennie in
Sydney’s Moore Park, Judge Sir Wil-
liam Windeyer sentenced nine of them
to death. The case and the sentences
imposed provoked a storm of contro-
versy. Many agreed with Sir William
when he expressed the hope that “no
maudlin feeling of pity will save you
from the death you so richly deserve”.
But there were also protests, public meet-
ings and petitions demanding reprieves.
In the end only four youths were hanged.
Tl T,. ha \, been . O n " mber ° f refer '
ences to the Mount Rennie case in recent
weeks as heavy sentences for gang rape
have been imposed by Mr Justice
Co hns and Mr Justice McClemens an
Sydney Central Criminal Court. Yet
the only moral that has been drawn by
editor,aland letter writers is that todays
mass rapists are lucky they did not live
80 years ago”. This may be true, but it
is trivial. The historical parallel has
other more significant implications: Per-
haps the principal lesson of history in
this context concerns our own persistent
ignorance. One leading newspaper,
under the heading “City in the Shadow
of Shame”, editorialised to the effect that
“our whole community cannot but be
humiliated by these shameful events”.
It is not clear exactly what was intended
by all this, but there are grounds for
mortification, not least because we know
very little more today about the pheno-
menon of gang rape than our ancestors
a century ago.
Of course there have been the ex-
pected demands for corporal punishment
and castration. And the customary
phrases—“depraved young animals”,
“cowardly sadistic assaults by packs of
louts”, “unbridled licence, degradation
and bestiality”—have been aired. Nor
are such expressions of public indigna-
tion altogether undesirable or inappro-
priate. A society in which violent crime
did not provoke a hostile public reaction
might be more comfortable for violent
criminals. It is likely that it would also
be more dangerous for the rest of us.
But indignation alone is not enough;
and u is disturbi that it is s 0 often
expressed in terms which t that
, jke the Bourbons we bave learn J nothing
and forgotten nothing. It is true that we
know iittle . But eve n the little we
do know seems either no , t 0 have becn
disseminated or t 0 have met with an
invincible refusal to learn.
'
Perhaps the most egregious example
of this is the perennial myth about the
unique effectiveness of corporal punish-
ment as a deterrent. “The threat of
physical punishment may be a greater
deterrent to the wolf pack than the most
severe jail sentence” ran one editorial.
And five days later a twenty-year-old
wolf pack member asked Mr Justice Me-
Clemens if he could be flogged instead
of being sentenced to “a long, humiliating
term in prison”. He added that he
thought corporal punishment would act
as a deterrent to others. The judge re-
fused his request on the ground that he
would not be a party to any punishment
which degrades the person who inflicts it.
One regrets that he did not also refer to
the overwhelming evidence regarding the
ineffectiveness of corporal punishment
presented in two celebrated English re-
ports—Report of the Departmental Com-
mittee on Corporal Punishment (1938)
and Corporal Punishment: Report of the
Advisory Committee on the Treatment
of Offenders (1960). It is true that with
regard to castration the evidence is
rather more equivocal. But some Ameri-
can studies suggest that it aggravates
psychopathology and may in some cases
increase rather than decrease the possi-
bility of abnormal and criminal acts. _
There is on the other hand some evi-
dence that lon « P nson sentences do deter
Potential offenders. Of course those
upon whom exemplary punishments are
imposed do not relish the experience,
But neither do the victims of gang rape.
Moreover it should be remembered that
se x offenders, other than the grossly
pathological, customarily receive favor-
able consideration for parole. This is
because there is considerable evidence
that they repeat their crimes much less
frequently than other types of criminals
and that parole violations are very low.
With regard to rapists second offences
of any kind are rare; and of those who
do repeat the majority commit crimes
other than sexual. The FBI reported
some years ago on recidivism in twenty-
five types of crime; drug addicts have the
most recidivism, then larceny, drunken-
ness, burglary; rape is nineteenth.

said that no clear cut research work has
been done in regard to the problem of
gang rape. Three comments, however,
may be ventured. They go further than
the evidence warrants perhaps, but are
based, in part, on personal experience
with this type of offender.
In the first place it is notable that in
a recent case involving four young men
evidence was given that one was a mem-
ber of a family marred by ill-treatment
due to the father’s excessive drinking.
Another had an alcoholic mother and a
father who had deserted the home; he
was cruelly ill-treated for many years by
the man with whom the mother lived and
frequently forced to seek shelter with a
neighbor. A third was the child of di-
vorced parents with a bad family back-
ground. The fourth —an Aborigine-
had a broken family and no parental con-
trol. No doubt many have survived
similar circumstances without becoming
criminal. But there is also no doubt
that such backgrounds typically result in
personalities which are hard, bitter, con-
scienceless and egocentric, with little
feeling for the rights of others. More-
over, the incidence of parental cruelty
and rejection in the cases of violent
offenders of all kinds is far too high to
be merely coincidental. Explanation is
not the same as exculpation, but if we
are concerned with controlling the
future rather than moralising about the
past or the present the most obvious
prophylactic measure would be the in-
vestment of resources in the prevention
of cruelty to children.
Another comment which is relevant
here concerns the nature of the
offence. It is a sexual offence. It might
seem otiose to mention this. But some
psychiatrists who explain non-sexual
crimes such as arson and burglary in
terms of sexual motivation have suggest-
ed that the reverse may hold for certain
types of aggressive sexual offences. Yet in
most cases it is surely unnecessary to
seek for occult motives. Forcible rape
has always been typically a young man’s
crime. And, because of the reluctance
of many victims to report it, it is pro-
bably more common than we realise.
Nor is its prevalence really very sur-
prising. The attitude of most adults in
our society to sex is so inconsistent,
repressive, and anxiety-ridden that it is
remarkable that morbid sex development
is not more common. Some years ago
a British Attorney-General opening the
prosecution in an obscenity case said:
“The book deals with what everybody
will recognise as an unsavoury subject—
gratification of the sexual appetite”. One
consequence of treating sex as unsavoury
is that it becomes associated with other
unsavoury things such as violence and
crime. And perversely whilst millions
of paper backs in which sexual behavior

is linked with force, violence and cruelty
circulate freely, works in which it is
associated with pleasure, affection and
love are banned. Most children with
reasonably secure homes and affection-
ate parents are resilient. But until
adult attitudes become more sound and
wholesome we must expect sexual
maladjustment in juveniles, in some of
whom the sexual drive will be expressed
in menacing and violent forms.
Penally, it is important to note that
gang rape is a group activity. It is not
unusual for violent sex crimes by juve-
niles to follow this pattern. Studies of
sexual deviation in California have re-
vealed that over half of the most serious
and aggressive sex offences committed by
delinquents in San Francisco were gang
motivated. Rapists incidentally are not
usually hypersexual and frequently they
are inadequate and even effeminate. In
the gang feelings of inferiority and in-
adequacy are exhilaratingly dissipated.
Moreover, the victim of gang rape is
degraded and placed in an inferior posi-
tion which satisfies the offenders’ desire
for dominance. Gang rape serves the
double purpose of relieving sexual ten-
sion and allaying the fear of women.
The term “gang” is misleading. The
groups involved seldom bear any resem-
blance to the gangs with leaders, initia-
tion rites, definite membership, and
temporal continuity so common in books
about juvenile delinquency. They are
commonly fluid, unorganised, loosely
structured, promiscuous combinations.
These loose, leaderless, impermanent
associations have little group loyalty as
witness their readiness to indulge in
mutual incrimination in court. They are
frequently held together by little more
than the fact that it is only in the group
that individuals find the courage and
mutual stimulation necessary for carry-
ing out the anti-social activity which
expresses their resentment and releases
their frustration. The individual who
initiates a particular orgy usually has no
powers of leadership or status in the
group at all.
Such groups, however, represent a
considerable danger to society and do
far more damage than solitary offenders.
Indeed it is commonplace that in groups
individuals commit crimes which they
would not commit alone. Most research
in the field of juvenile delinquency has
been concerned with the individual
delinquent or the gang proper which is
a relatively rare phenomenon. It is time
a serious attempt was made to study
such collective delinquent activities as
multiple rape, vandalism and other forms
of hooliganism; and to obtain detailed
data on the structure and functioning of
the groups which precipitate and sustain
them.


A Morning At Bishopscourt
“Something like a reformation is coming ”
By PETER HASTINGS
Aspring sun shone warmly on the
garden at Bishopscourt. The yellow
sandstone of the old building
glowed in the sunlight. It was a perfect
Sydney morning. A gardener called off
the Archbishop s dog intent on sniffing
my legs, and a Spanish servant ans-
wering the door indicated by energetic
signs that he possessed no English but
that I should follow him. Dr Gough
was dictating but waved me courteously
into the long baronial library where I
had interviewed him three years ago
for The Bulletin. A little greyer, per-
haps a little thinner too, at 58 he is as
handsome as ever, and as courteous, the
voice as high-pitched, the accent as clip-
ped, precise and English.
He looked both well and confident. A
great deal of water, we agreed, had flowed
under the bridge. And now? “Well this
is home, you see. The more I go back
to England the more I realise that this
- is where I belong and where I want to
stay. I have friends in England, of course,
but this is home. And besides . . . it’s
as if England were floundering. Too
many people in England now seriously
refer to the ‘post-Christian world’. A
world of gross secularism and material-
ism? I think there’s a change coming,
though. Something in the order of a
reformation.”
And Bishopscourt was also home? The
Archbishop gave a wry smile. “I don't
know that it is. It’s far too big, you see.
And y OU can 't get domestics. We've got
Fernando,” he jerked his head towards
the door, “but willing as he is he can’t
speak English, you know that if we are in
the drawing-room we have to walk forty
yards for a glass of water? It’s not at all
comfortable. My wife and I were in-
trigued with your story about The Swifts.
Enormous house, isn’t it? I suspect the
Cardinal won’t really live there, you
know; he’ll move back to the Presbytery.
We had afternoon tea there too, shortly
before you did. He has no servant prob-
lem, of course, which my wife noted. Of
course, he has the nuns to help him.
He’d need it too in that great house.”
He paused reflectively. “It’s a bit dark,
that house, although it has one or two
nice things in it.”
State Aid
sphere was a knock at the door. Fer-
A nando came mutely in with coffee
and biscuits. Talking of the Cardinal re-
minded me, I said, of the problems of
State Aid. “Problems?” asked the Pri-
mate. “Oh yes. There are problems
all right. What confounds me about
the Press, you know, is the way they
cheerfully assumed that I was opposed
to State Aid when I hadn’t stated what
my position was. As you know I told
Synod that I favor State Aid for those
schools which wish to avail themselves of
it. Standing Committee had approved it,
and some schools have already applied
for it. Incidentally, you were wrong
three years ago in describing Synod as
a Church “cabinet”. It’s really Synod in
action when Synod’s not in session. Of
course Synod can revoke the decision of
Standing Committee, which makes things
a little complicated. The motion before
Synod to prevent Church schools apply-
ing for State Aid was carried last week.
But as Metropolitan I’m in favor of it.
It’s up to the schools after all.”
And the syllabus? The Archbishop
went smoothly on. “What we say is this:
this is a Christian community, and there
is a duty upon us to teach the basic facts
of Christianity to our children for a half-
hour period a week. It’s simply not
enough to bracket it with Mohammed-
anism or Judaism and say it’s just an-
other religion. It’s not. It’s Christianity.
Now I don’t think it’s too hard to find
a teacher in each school who will teach
the basic facts about the birth of Christ,
His life and death. As for comparative
religion, by all means have that as part
of the social studies syllabus. I’m not
against that. But this business of teaching
Christianity is very important. In the
outlying parts of the Diocese we now
have 100 clergymen spending between
20 and 30 half-hour periods a week at
schools teaching basic Christianity and
neglecting other duties to do so. We have
600 lay men and women doing the same

thing to take the pressure off the clergy
and we could use double the number.”
Homosexuality
"TWidently His Grace felt that the
" young were very much in need of
instruction. “Of course.” And that he felt
many of the youth in this country were
in a parlous condition, as he had re-
cently put it, “in a mire of sexuality.”
He grimaced. “Perhaps I should be more
discreet. I thought to myself only
the other day when Malcolm Sargent
observed all those young people who
went to Hastings and those other south
coast towns to play the fool, that they
were a minority. What about the thous-
ands of young people who queued for his
concerts? I thought it was a very good re-
mark.” Perhaps it was not so much that
youth today was necessarily more im-
moral than at any other time, but more
tolerant? Homosexuality, for example ...
“I’m glad you brought that up,” His
Grace interr pted, “I want to say some-
thing about that. Many people think we
are lacking in sympathy for homosexuals.
Not at all. I regard them as unfortunate,
suffering from a disease like alcoholism.
But, you know, it still cannot be toler-
ated. As Bishop Goodwin Hudson said
just before he left—we cannot tolerate
evil just because it’s fashionable to do so.
I’m quite sure that if a lad, and there
are doubtless many of them, has un-
fortunate tendencies that way then he
feels he can indulge them because youth
and society are tolerant of them. If
society was not tolerant of homosexual-
ity the same boy might struggle man-
fully with himself and guide his affec-
tions along normal channels.”
And was not youth also scornful, in-
tolerant and irreverent, which was some-
times mistaken for having immoral at-
titudes? There are, for example, maga-
zines ... “I don't think that the sort
of stuff that has appeared in magazines is
just irreverent. It is also dirty.” Not even
satirical? “I appreciate the point you
make,” said the Archbishop, “and it may
be as you say, but I am not convinced
that it was not primarily immoral and
dirty in intent.”
Did His Grace find any incompatibility
between his obvious convictions that the
Western world floundered in a grey tide
of secularism on the one hand and the
growing impetus of the move towards
church unity together with what might be
called signs of a religious revivai on the
other? “I did not mean to sound so
absolute,” he replied. “There are signs of
religious revival. I noticed that in Eng-
land; a desire to do away with religiosity
and churchianity. Of course I don’t go as
far as the Bishop of Woolwich but I do
think the Church needs not only a new
image but streamlining. Have you heard
of the Paul Report? It is a splendid docu-
ment. It suggests, for example, that Par-
son’s Freehold should become Parson’s
Leasehold. You know how hard it is to
move a clergyman from his freehold? In
fact only for blatant immorality or for
heresy which is extremely difficult to
prove. What’s being suggested now is that
a parson stay in one place for, say, 10
years and then move on. I tossed this
suggestion out at a meeting here some
little time ago and it got a surprisingly
warm reception.”
And church unity? “My goodness,
how far it's come in the three years
since I’ve seen you, although there are
some like Bishop Muldoon who pour
cold water on unity. He came and
talked to us once, you know. He was
very intelligent and, of course, we
were able to ask him the big question
which I couldn’t put to the Cardinal,
whom one can't embarrass as principal
bishop. It was quite obvious to me that
the Roman position hasn’t changed all
that much. They still want us to make
the big move. They don't quite seem
to have realised that both sides have got
to give way.” Was the validity of Angli-
can orders still a problem?
Anzac Day
“T/hs-A-vis Rome? Yes. Do you know
" I spotted something here with the
Cardinal. You know this joint Anzac
ceremony? The first year the Cardinal
arrived in ordinary clothes while I wore
a cassock. He did it again the following
year. I’m quite certain it has something,
everything in fact, to do with the validity
of orders. Nor does the Cardinal join
in the ceremony as a religious one. A
layman says prayers as you know.
However, things are changing. Asking
Protestant observers to the Vatican
Council is proof of that.”
Did the Archbishop of Canterbury,
representing, as he did, great theological
scholarship and a distinct Anglo-
Catholic position, have much effect on the
unity movement? “I’m sure he does.
Although the Anglo-Catholics are a bit
touchy on validity of orders these days.
Church unity being in the air they are
sensitive to any suggestion that Anglican
orders are invalid. I’ve asked Dr Ramsey
to visit Australia. I thought about it quite
a bit. He’s a man very occupied with
fundamental matters of faith and belief,
a great scholar and a holy man. There-
fore, he’s not everyone’s cup of tea.
But I watched him at the Toronto
Congress last year and he was a tremen-
dous hit. He quite became the natural
leader of the Congress not merely be-
cause of his position as Canterbury but
by reason of his mind and capacity.

the first story? His Grace seemed reluc-
tant but finally told it.
“There were a couple of sailors in a
train, going from Portsmouth to London
on leave. In a corner sat a young par-
son listening with mounting concern to
these two describing how they would
paint the town red with wine, women and
song. The parson was itching to put his
oar in when one of the sailors looked up
from a newspaper and said to his friend:
‘Bill, what’s sciatica?' The parson
grabbed his chance and before Bill could
reply he leant over and said, ‘That's what
you get after wine, women and song.’
The sailor looked up and said, ‘ls that
so? Well it says 'ere that the Archbishop
of Canterbury’s got it’.” His Grace
paused. “You can’t imagine how glad
I am that 1 didn't tell that story! - ’


Luigi, Infantino Terribile
" Making music is like making the atom bomb "
By J. C. KAYE
Luigi Infantino, the tenor, is here
again, travelling the Australian
circuit, molto vivace. Sing, fly,
sing . . . Luigi is in Perth one minute,
Adelaide the next, on to Melbourne in
a flash, then away to Sydney and the
north. No comparable hunk of musical
Sicilian (15 stone, sft Bin., 45in. chest)
has ever moved so fast across our
intervals.
Luigi has changed little, his fans will
be unsurprised to know, since he was in
Australia in 1955, 1957 and 1961. He
wears horn-rimmed glasses off stage, but
his hair is as black and crisply curly as
ever it was, his smile as quick and vast.
The fluent gestures, the miming and
mockery are still those of the true Italian
extrovert. And with his vivacity still
is the suggestion of sleepiness, so that
when Luigi suddenly rubs his eyes like
a child, you know you should leave.
We saw him in Dick Lean Jnr’s office
of Stadiums Ltd at the Southern Cross
Hotel soon after he came in from
Adelaide. He looked a bit crumpled,
but had a bright little carnation in his
buttonhole. Where had he been since
last time? Luigi’s hands indicated the
world North and South America,
Europe . . .
He is able to spend only a few weeks
a year in Rome with his wife, the actress
Sarah Ferrati, and their daughter,
Monica, 12. In Rome Mrs Infantino is
playing “Who’s Afraid of Virginia
Woolf?” It’s a hit.
When I asked if Monica were destined
for music or the boards, Luigi was
adamant: “No. I want she do nothing,”
he said. “Be a good girl. Good house-
keeper.”
He did not think the child could have
an over - romantic view of theatricals.
“We talk pretty disgusted before her,”
he explained.
Fast travelling leaves the gregarious
Luigi feeling lonely. There is little time
for people, good big friendly meals, and
companionable songs. “No friends, no-
body,” he said with an immense shrug,
as if tossing dust off his shoulders.
He needs people, and he enjoys
admiration. He mimed an incident in
Perth, or was it Adelaide? where a
woman came up to him, flung her arms
around him and wept. “I wonder what
is the trouble. Her husband, he is dead
perhaps?” The husband was not dead.
The woman was an English lady who
had heard him in London, and was
moved to see him here in Australia.
On Australian musical ability, Luigi
agrees with Maurice Clare, the Scottish-
born violinist who has just quit his job
as concertmaster of the Victorian
Symphony Orchestra. Too much in Aus-
tralia is second rate.
“Me, I studied solfeggio six years.
Making music is something serious. It
is like making the atomic bomb.”
Critics do not always agree with
Luigi's interpretations at his recitals, but
the war he had with one or two of them
here in 1955 has never broken out afresh.
“I never, never come back here. Not
for 300 years. I tell the world, too,” was
Luigi’s outburst nine years ago. But he
didn’t mean it, really.
The postal official’s son from Racal-
muto remembers poverty. He is rich
now “Thanks God”, as he says. He
has farms and villas. He feels the years.
"I am 42. The middle of my life.” But
there is no thought of retiring.
TV has been an enemy. Picking up
a record of La Traviata from Dick
Lean’s desk Luigi said: “I sold a million
copy. And Barb'seville another million.”
But that was before the Years of the
Box. He doesn't even like appearing on
TV. He needs the live people out there.
Rich or not he has his money worries.
From his wallet he pulled his receipt for
one night at the South Australian Hotel
in Adelaide. I noticed the amount was
£5/15/-.
“Very heavy,” he said. “Good hotels
abroad, not so dear.”
He voiced another complaint about
Adelaide. Over there he had to try out
four accompanists before he found a
good one.
Mumbling to himself, he mimed his
brush with one applicant, using the desk
edge as a piano.
Frankly, Luigi Infantino is just as
happy to do his own accompaniments.
He can play the violin, saxophone, flute
and bugle.
Luigi in fact is just a big, life-loving,
singing sort of fellow. And in these
moody days he’s a tonic.
Singer in Exile
South Africa “just one big prison "
By CHARLES SRIBER
66 I’d like to go home,
but ...” Miriam Makeba lifted
her slim arms and let them fall
hopelessly, “how can I? Things are get-
ting worse, not better and I can see no
hope of anything changing immediately.
Certainly the UN doesn’t appear to in-
tend doing anything.”
The diminutive South African singer,
who is here for a season at Chequers, sat
curled up on a divan in her Sydney
hotel room eyeing me with brown eyes
that seemed just a little wary. “And if
I did go back and risked gaol, where
could I sing?” Since the success of the
musical ‘King Kong’, the South African
Government has made it impossible for
an African artist to perform outside seg-
regated areas. Recently they organised a
trade fair intended to show the Africans
all the modern advantages of the country.
They toured hundreds of miles into the
villages demonstrating all kinds of electri-
cal gadgets.
“Most of the villages didn't even have
electricity so there wasn't much point in
that. Anyway, to publicise these affairs
they had Africans performing for their
own people, but outside these areas
they’re not wanted.”
Since her rise to world fame, Miriam
Makeba has tasted something of a life
vastly different from that she remembers
as a child and young girl in South
Africa. But affluence seems her least con-
cern. She has appeared free for such

A Keith Courtenay keeps its crisp new look longer than any other suit
varied causes as the Red Cross, the late
President Kennedy’s birthday celebrations
and the National Association for the Ad-
vancement of Coloured People.
Miriam Makeba's professional career
began in 1954 when a musical group
heard her sing at a benefit for the Afri-
can National Council. Known as the
Black Manhattan Brothers, they invited
her to join them and for three years she
toured all over South Africa and as far
afield as the Belgian Congo and Rhodesia.
Remember Sharpeville?
A revue company, styled African Jazz
and Variety, signed her up for a
further tour and it was while singing with
them that visiting American film-maker
Lionel Rogosin heard her and asked her
to take the lead in the semi-documentary
he was making. Without too much con-
sideration she agreed. Rogosin and his
company departed and she was signed to
play the lead in the first all - African
musical, “King Kong”. This was to ex-
plode like a fire cracker throughout
South Africa.
The film in which she had featured
was acclaimed at the 1959 Venice Festi-
val and won an award. But to the South
African Government it was seen as a
blow at apartheid and a criticism of con-
ditions under which Africans lived. Miss
Makeba came under fire and when New
York impresario Max Gordon offered
her an engagement, she left for the
United States.
She gives the impression that leaving
her homeland was not easy despite the
persecution she might have faced. “My
aunt and her three children were killed
at Sharpeville and I suppose there was
little future for me, but it wasn’t easy.
When my South African passport expired,
the authorities refused to renew it. For
six months I was without official nation-
ality.”
But besides winning accolades in New
York she was also travelling extensively
in Africa. “I sang at the African Unity
Conference fete and Mr Tom Mboya
spoke to the Tanganyikan Home Minis-
ter, Mr Kambona. He gave me a Tangan-
yikan passport.”
She studies the news that comes out
of South Africa assiduously but her
face clouds as she speaks of it. “I can
see no hope. Things are getting worse,
not better. Every day the laws are being
tightened. As far as I can see it’s just
one big prison and even the people who
are not gaoled might as well be. What
are the people doing? What can they do?
This 90-day detention law makes so many
crack. They know it can be extended
indefinitely and there are ways of making
them talk about others who might have
plans for freedom. Under torture during
those 90 days, plenty open their mouths
and talk.”

THE PRINCELY HOLIDAY
The ‘Till” and the Public
“Too much communication, not enough research "
By PATRICIA ROLFE
Flr Gregory Pincus’s arrival in Syd-
ney a few days ago made the after-
noon paper posters as “Pill Man Here”.
A follow-up interview the next day got
another poster, “Birth Pill for Men”,
although there was nothing in the story
to bear out this claim. But this welcome
provided some contrast with Dr Pincus’s
previous visit three years ago.
Then he came unheralded, gave a
paper similar to the one he gave on
“Physiological Effects of Cyclical Ad-
ministration of Progestin - Oestrogen
Combination” at the Post - Graduate
Federation in Medicine symposium at
the weekend, got reported in the medical
journals, and then departed for the
United States.
Dr Pincus in the past three years has
become resigned to the fact that he is
working in a field which arouses great
public interest and he feels that the
public should be told what is going on.
“Communication is a great problem,
whether between scientists or between
science and the public,” he said. “Be-
fore the war I used to work in my
laboratory and perhaps give a paper a
year. Now I could be giving papers
every day of the year. I rather feel that
at the moment there is too much com-
munication and not enough research.”
Over - simplification by the layman
doesn’t worry him unduly, and he put
down the number of inches he had been
given in the daily Press to “Australian
hospitality”.
Dr Pincus, who is credited with being
one of the discoverers of oral contra-
ceptives for women, said that he believed
the products now available in variety,
and particularly a new preparation with
lower drug content, were effective and
adequate. However, this did not mean,
so far as he was concerned, that research
was at an end.
“We believe that oral contraceptives
are biologically beneficial,” he said. “But
we still must study the long-term effect,

Tunnelling in progress, Snowy Mountains Scheme.
Partners in a mountain problem
Rock drills with air line hose,
Tunnelling through the Great Dividing Range poses extra tough problems for the contractors
on the mighty Snowy Mountains Scheme but Dunlop Industrial Products Division have
been able to assist in many ways.
Dunlop have provided extra light weight, yet extra tough nylon air line hose for rock drills;
hoses for water; belts for muckers; wire braided hose for hydraulic equipment and conveyor
belts to shift the aggregate at construction sites.
Dunlop is well represented elsewhere. In Tasmania a special tear-resistant conveyor belt was
used in tunnelling operations that established a new world record at Poatina.
Dunlop conveyor belts and Wedgropes also play a big part at Tinaroo Dam, Queensland.
With all this Dunlop engineering come the men of the Dunlop Technical Service, on-the-spot
working partners right from the planning stage.
Wherever great national development projects afe in action so is Dunlop.

It sounds ridiculous, but frankly, we’re looking for a name to
describe Avery Labels. Some people call them self-adhesive . . .
... others refer to them as pressure-sensitive, or self-sticking.
In point of fact, all are quite correct, but don’t go far enough.
For instance:
Avery labels require no moisture or glue to stick down □ Avery
labels are applied with just the lightest pressure of the finger
□ Avery labels can be stuck on wood, glass, paper, plastics,
metal or any clean smooth surface □ Avery labels are made of
paper, foil, acetate or cloth □ Avery labels are made in two types
PERMAGRIP for permanent adhesion and KUM-KLEEN
for temporary adhesion.
Avery labels are manufactured in Australia under franchise by:

what happens when they are taken over
a long period by a large number of
women. At present our group is doing
controlled experiments on 10,000
women in the United States and Haiti,
but we must also see if present prepara-
tions are suitable in other societies, such
as Asia and Africa. And we still must
see what we can find which will satisfy
the Catholics.”
Dr Pincus said that he and the rest
of his group had never had any official
communication with the Catholic Church
on oral contraceptives. “And, of course,
the Catholic Church is not opposed to
experiment,” he said. “They learnt
their lesson with Galileo. I feel that I
understand the Catholic attitude to
human life, but I think its opposition
to oral contraceptives is based on a
biological misconception and on scien-
tific attitudes which are no longer
tenable.”
Dr Pincus is not over-anxious to lap
over into sociology or psychology. “I’m
a physiologist,” he insists, but he felt
there were still answers which science
had to find to social and personal
problems. “For instance, there is a
study going on in Pakistan at present,”
he said, “trying to find something which
we can give to women who can’t count
to 21, who would not know when a
month began or ended and who do not
understand menstruation. There may be
a pill they can take after intercourse.
Even primitive women must recognise
that as something which has happened.”
Teenage mothers of seven
TAr Pincus said that although an effec-
tive formula had been found, science
still had to find out how oral contra-
ceptives achieved their purpose. “That
I find fascinating,” he said. “At present
a study on animals is being made in
London to see if the drug works on a
centre of the brain, but to date we really
know nothing, nothing of how the whole
thing works.”
Dr Pincus said he had not begun
research as a young scientist with fertility
control as a definite goal, but now he
believed he could not have achieved any-
thing which could have brought more
satisfaction. “After seeing Puerto Rican
women with seven children at the age
of 18 1 can’t believe otherwise,” he
said.
“However, we do tend to think of
fertility control working in a democratic
society in which people have freedom of
choice. Asian officials have said to us,
‘Can’t you find something to mix in
their food, then they’ll never know.’
That’s the sort of attitude 1 don’t like.”

"MAD MAL" THE MODEST MOD
Oir Malcolm Sargent has drawn
attention to a new switch in
teenage tastes. At this year’s Fondon
promenade concerts, he said, no fewer
than 300 girls were carried out swoon-
ing. As he put it, “The Beatles are
not having things all their own way.”
Behind this news is a remarkable
breakthrough by classical music
among the under-20 public. Record
shops report booming sales of Beet-
hoven platters. In Britain another fac-
tor has been the strong appeal of Sir
Malcolm himself for girls. He did
not mention this —he is modest to
a fault but many of them say that
“Mad Mai” (as they call him) is
dreamy and wild. While he was con-
ducting Wagner, a fan screamed “He’s
the Ringo of the Nibelungs!” and
fainted dead away.
As might be expected, teenagers
who have begun to dig the classics
regard the tastes of their elders with
youthful intolerance. Parents who like
to listen to Elvis Presley or the Rolling
Stones are now contemptuously
termed “squares”. There are quarrels
at breakfast time over the choice of
radio programmes. A Sydney mother
was enjoying You Really Got Me,
as rendered by The Kinks, when her
16-year-old daughter turned the dial
to a station playing the latest Wolf
Mozart hit. The mother protested, but
the pert girl merely replied: “It's time
you got with the Salzburg Beat.”
The new trend took the teenage in-
dustry more or less by surprise. Radio
stations such as 2SM, where the Good
Guys spin discs around the clock, are
busy converting to the classical reper-
tory. Popular jocks like Murf the Surf
have to brush up on musicology and
counterpoint in their spare time.
I asked Rob Hedges, the ace turn-
table compere, what he thought of
the change. He was enthusiastic. “It’s
the biggest thing since the folkies came
in,” he said. “You’d be surprised at
the reaction we get. Yesterday I played
the Meistersingers overture it’s on
the flip side of Gene Ormandy’s new
Tristan FP. Do you know, the station
switchboard was jammed with calls.
The kids really go for that Bayreuth
Sound.”
At Rob’s invitation I sat beside
him in the studio while he presented
his session, Tops of the Ops.
“Hello, you classical cats!” he said
cheerily. “You’re with 2GX, the Sym-
phony Station, and have we got music
for you tonight! All the big ones from
the Top Eighty. Here to start with is
a number that’s climbing fast in the
charts Art (Fingers) Rubinstein
plays Fred Chopin’s Polonaise in A
Flat. But first I’d like to remind you
that for full-flavored satisfaction you
can’t beat Burlington's Choc -a -
Blocs ...”
Show promoters are riding the
boom. I spoke to Mike Pizarro, of
Inca Services, who brought the Schu-
bert String Quartet and other teenage
idols to this country. “There are all
sorts of angles to this game,” he said
thoughtfully. “We did very well with
our Beethoven wigs, for example. I’m
thinking of launching a Brahms beard.
At present I’m negotiating to bring out
Otto Klemperer and his group. Otto
is a bit scared the kids will tear his
shirt off and souvenir his socks and
that sort of thing. But I've promised
him police protection right from the
airport.”
There is, of course, a more disturb-
ing side to the classical mania. Holiday
resorts have seen some ugly brawls
between rival teenage factions. Gangs
of Bach and Handel devotees, known
as Baroquers, arm themselves with
fence pickets and fight it out with the
Mods, who are keen on Stravinsky and
Schoenberg.
I asked the Rev. Norman Biggs,
well-known for his social work among
adolescents, to tell me his views on
this problem. He staunchly defended
the average teenager. “The delinquents
are a small minority,” he said. “It is
unfair to suggest that young people
in general are driven to violence by
classical music. I am broad-minded
about it. In fact, I encourage boys and
girls to play their Bach and Stravinsky
records at our church fellowship
evenings. Their behavior is not a bit
worse than when they used to play
rock-and-roll.”
My own opinion is much the same
as Mr Biggs’. The present craze for
works like Beethoven’s Emperor Con-
certo, I believe, is fundamentally
harmless. It offers an outlet for youth-
ful high spirits. After all, the parents
of these young people had their own
musical fads once. They were “sent”
by numbers like Chattanooga Choo
Choo and Elmer’s Tune. It did not
slop them from growing into the
decent, normal citizens they are today.

OVERSEAS
Why Khrushchev Fell
Mishandling Mao
From EDWARD CRANKSHAW in London
TlThen the first intimation that a great
" leader is about to retire is the un-
explained taking down of his portraits
from the public places of Moscow, it
looks more like Soviet bloody-minded-
ness than Soviet clumsiness. Somebody
got the order through to those picture-
hangers very efficiently and very swiftly.
But even if the Soviet leadership is
feeling bloody-minded about Mr Khrush-
chev it does not mean that they will im-
mediately reverse all his policies and
start threatening the West with the
horrors. All along, Soviet opposition
to Mr Khrushchev has been more based
on his manner and his timing than on
what he has actually done. There was
fierce opposition to him for allowing the
de-Stalinisation in 1956 to go so fast
that it encouraged Poles and Hungarians
to revolt. There was fierce opposition
on, apparently, a more limited scale, to
some of his major essays in Russian
gigantomania, the Virgin Lands cam-
paign, the Grow-More Maize campaign.
There was fierce opposition to his gentle
treatment, his encouragement even, of
rebellious writers.
The Cuban adventure tarnished his
image badly. There has been fierce op-
position from managerial tycoons dis-
placed or weakened in the course of the
great reorganisation of industry. There
has been frequent distaste at his bluster-
ing, bullying, over-familiar ways, his
lack of Russian Gravitas (which will
be supplied to perfection by the boot-
faced Mr Brezhnev). There has been
fierce opposition to his insistence on put-
ting consumer goods before heavy in-
dustry and, among the military-minded,
for his run-down of the Soviet conven-
tional forces and their supplies, and his
reliance for defence on rocketry.
Western visitors insist that he is greatly
beloved in Russia. I don't know how
they feel able to pronounce on this.
Certainly he has managed to appeal to
the peasants, the first time a Soviet leader
has done this since the collectivisation.
But in doing so he has alienated the
workers in the towns, by Stalin compara-
tively pampered—if freedom from starva-
tion counts as pampering. The disastrous
harvest of 1963 had far more serious
effects than is generally realised here.
Russian housewives, 20 years after the
war, several years after Khrushchev had
told them they would soon eat better
than the Americans, were bitter about
the queues for bread and sugar in which
they once more found themselves.
Khrushchev had so intimately associ-
ated himself with the promise of richer
times that it was hard for him to find a
scapegoat of the traditional kind. The
Agricultural Revolution was to have been
Khrushchev’s success: its failure could
be only Khrushchev’s failure —and an-
other excuse for his opponents to get
rid of him.
What was the immediate cause? Was
it Khrushchev’s Chinese policy? In a
limited sense, probably yes. But not, I
think, because many of his colleagues
were outraged by his alienation of China
as such. The trouble, surely, was in
Khrushchev’s handling of the Chinese
quarrel.
Nobody could have objected much to
his original forcing of the issue at the
Moscow conference of the 81 parties in
November, 1960. The one man most
likely to have viewed Khrushchev’s par-
ticular way of carrying on with more or
less total disapproval, Mikhail Suslov, an
old Stalinist of impeccable antecedents,
lent himself to the quarrel in the early
days to the extent of personally organis-
ing the Soviet attack.
Much more questionable were Khrush-
chev’s later forcing tactics and the way
in which he trod so roughly over the
susceptibilities of the fraternal parties—
the Poles, above all, within the bloc; the
Italians, above all, outside it—as to pro-
duce an incipient mulishness on their
part which, ignored, soon flared into
something like open revolt. This dissent
crystallised round Khrushchev’s demand
for a December meeting of selected Com-
munists to prepare for the grand all-party
meeting which would formally pronounce
anathema on Peking. To date, only 12
parties had replied in a favorable sense.
And something must have been very
wrong with Muscovite authority when it
could not prevent the Italian comrades
from publishing, in spite of Russian pro-
tests, Togliatti’s so-called testament criti-
cising the Russians for their regular pre-
tence that all was going well inside the
Soviet bloc, and the inevitably regular
exposure of the falsity of these claims.
Khrushchev’s successors, Leonid
Brezhnev, a tough, energetic but dull-
seeming man with absurdly heavy eye-
brows; and Kosygin, a gifted technocrat
and administrator, are exactly the choice
one would have made to succeed Khrush-
chev had he died a natural death. Tn a
sense he had made this choice himself.
It can be assumed that these men are in
broad sympathy with his general policies.
Brezhnev is a post-revolutionary ap-
parition who never fought at the barri-
cades. Kosygin held his own under
Stalin as the boss of an exiguous light
industry. He gets on well with Western
businessmen. Neither of these will start
a war, but they may decide, under the
influence of the military, that Khrush-
chev has been dangerously weakening
the armed forces and has put out too
many hostages to fortune in his con-
viction that the US does not want a
war.
They will not immediately make
friends with Mao Tse-tung. Without a
total and dramatic repudiation of
Khrushchev and all he stood for this
could happen one day, but not yet —-
they cannot do this. But Mao, if he
wishes to, can now say without losing
face that his main object, the destruction
of the renegade Khrushchev, has been
achieved though the Khrushchev

They all choose SELEX DECAL window transfers. Why?
Making transfers is a job for experts. To satisfy quality-conscious clients,
a transfer maker must be capable of doing the finest printing —litho,
letterpress, or screen. He needs a plant almost hermetically sealed against
dust, and temperature-controlled to prevent stretching and shrinkage.
Another requirement is an expensively-equipped laboratory staffed by technicians
Who can test the flow properties of different inks under different conditions...
lacquers and enamels too; establish what light does to different pigments;
determine the longevity of clear varnishes, the tenacity of hundreds of
different adhesives. He must have ruthless quality controllers and a racy
organization that gets the transfers into the advertiser’s hands before the
Campaign breaks. It takes expertise and a big operation. It takes Selex Decal
the largest manufacturers of transfers in the Southern Hemisphere.

Mao’s Bomb
Overshadowing the
Jenkins affair
From GEORGE McGANN
in New York
"Doth Washington and United Nations
** headquarters, New York City,
reacted with remarkable unanimity last
week to the startling developments in
Russia and China; the ouster of Khrush-
chev and the explosion of the first Red
Chinese atom bomb occurred within 24
hours of each other and are regarded
as being directly linked.
It was obvious that Moscow knew the
explosion of the Chinese atom bomb
was imminent and had probably been
advised of the exact hour and place in
advance. After all Dean Rusk warned
Americans 17 days earlier that the
Chinese explosion was not far off. The
Central Committee met in Moscow and
moved to beat Chinese Communists to
the propaganda punch, as it were, with
its political fait accompli.
Delegates in the United Nations build-
ing agreed the detonation of the atom
bomb not only marked China’s ascension
to new world stature, it signalled the
start of a determined effort to “blast its
way” into the United Nations. One
member of the Japanese delegation
(which has consistently voted with
United States against Red Chinese mem-
bership) remarked: “This explosion will
induce almost every Afro-Asian country
to insist Red China be admitted this
year.”
In America the two developments are
expected to enhance President Johnson’s
already rosy prospects of success against
Senator Goldwater on November 3.
They have left the American voter with
the thought he would only be adding to
the risk of an already perilous situation
by “changing horses in midstream” and
putting a new man in White House—
the third in little more than a year.
The timing of the twin blows from
Moscow and Peking was particularly
fortuitous for President Johnson, since
the news completely overshadowed the
sensational Jenkins affair which had
burst upon the country only the day
before, the disclosure that the President’s
close personal aide for 25 years, Walter
Jenkins, had been arrested for the second
time on a homosexual offence would
ordinarily have played straight into
hands of Senator Goldwater. Moscow
and Peking seemingly conspired against
the Goldwaterites.


“YOU STACK THE DISHES.
I’LL STACK THE CHAIRS.”

Picking
The Cabinet
“You have to put your
stuff over ”
By LORD ATTLEE
TJaving won the election, Harold Wil-
son’s first big job is to choose his
Cabinet. In a way it is more difficult
than winning the election, because in
choosing his Cabinet the Prime Minister
is on his own, and carries the can for his
mistakes. Once the appointments have
been made, he is going to be stuck with
them for a considerable period.
The qualities of the ideal Cabinet
Minister are: Judgment, strength of
character, experience of affairs, and an
understanding of ordinary people. A
Cabinet is not a place for eloquence
one reason why good politicians are not
always good Cabinet Ministers. It is judg-
ment which is needed to make important
decisions on imperfect knowledge in a
limited time. Men either have it, or they
haven’t.
Strength of character is required to
stand up to criticism from other Cabinet
members, pressure from outside groups,
and the advice of civil servants. It is
also necessary when policies, on which
the Cabinet has agreed, are going through
the doldrums, or are beginning to fail.
General experience of affairs is most
valuable: experience of organisations, of
groups and societies, or of business and
industry. (Businessmen, however, while
good in Cabinet, may not be good in the
House of Commons, not used to explain-
ing and defending their courses of action
to the public: this is essential, and is the
reason why men like Woolton failed.)
Cabinet Ministers are no good if they
cannot put their stuff over in the House
——sell it, explain it.
Young men cannot be expected to have
much experience, but this need not ex-
clude them from the Cabinet. Harold
Wilson was in the Cabinet at the age of
30, and was a model of what at that age
a Cabinet member can be. He had con-
siderable knowledge of a particular field,
stuck to it and didn’t talk too much, did
not try to impress, was not afraid of his
seniors, was on top of his civil servants,
and when he spoke did so with authority.
Gordon Walker was also in for a short
time. I can give him good marks, too.
It is a curious thing that nearly every
Cabinet throws up at least one man,
of whom a newcomer might ask: “What
is he doing here?”
He is there because he is wise. You
will hear a junior Cabinet Minister be-
ing told by the Prime Minister, perhaps.
“If you are going to do that, old boy,
you would be well advised to have a
talk with X.”
The ability to talk attractively in
Cabinet is not essential. Being able to
put a case clearly and succinctly and
simply is what counts. The Cabinet is
certainly not the place for rhetoric.
Though an excellent head of department
and a conciliator of genius, Nye Bevan
used to talk a bit too much occasionally.
The occasions when he talked too
much were when he got excited because
he felt that our policies were falling short
of the pure milk of the word. This goes
for most such interruptions, and a Prime
Minister should try to avoid these time-
consuming expressions of guilt or
electoral fear —by trying to reassure
from time to time the pure in heart who
feel the Government is backsliding.
However, you cannot choose people
according to what makes an ideal
Cabinet Minister. In the first place, you
must choose people with regard to keep-
ing balance within the Party. This need
not be overdone. It is a matter of demo-
cratic common sense, not of craven
below-the-scene manipulation. It would
not do to have all trade unionists in a
Labor Cabinet, or all constituency mem-
bers, or all middle-class intellectuals, or
all ornaments of the Co-operative Party.
Some working-class trade unionists are
in fact honorary members of the intelli-
gentsia (Nye again), while I have known

Charlie Trevelyan, for instance—the
ate Sir Charles Trevelyan, elder brother
>f the historian and a former-Education
Minister).
A Prime Minister must also bear in
nind the Party’s view of a man’s
apacity, because this could be crucial
n getting through unpalatable policies
ast. But he must also have his own view
)f him, and not part with it easily This

int, how the Opposition behaves to him.
Nobody at his peak was more powerful
han Baldwin in his Cabinet. Baldwin
at for hours listening in the House.
When Lloyd George stopped going to
he House, his grip weakened.
Another factor which limits a
Premier’s freedom of choice is per-
sonality. Herbert Morrison and Ernie
Bevin did not hit it off together.
I could not have Herbert as Leader of
the House, for which he was well fitted,
with Ernie also on the home front as
Chancellor of the Exchequer. This was
the balancing factor in Ernie getting the
Foreign Office. As it happened, he
proved to be a great Foreign Secretary.
Nor does a man always get the job
he wants, or which you would best like
him to have. I disappointed Chuter Ede,
who wanted to be Minister for Education,
because I wanted him for the more dif-
ficult task of Home Secretary. Chuter
never complained, but just got on with
it. Your two or three main jobs must
go to your two or three main men.
Ability is not conclusive standing in
the Party must be considered. Not that
men popular in the Party should assume
they have a predestined right to office.
I do not like this Shadow Cabinet
business. It may lead a man to think he
is an authority on a subject and there-
fore a certainty for that department
when the time comes. Besides, men
should not be encouraged to specialise
too much: there is too much of that
already. The Prime Minister should be
understood to be the only certainty for
a job: everybody else should be
ultimately at his disposal.
Ministers should not be allowed too
much freedom in appointing their
deputies or junior ministers. It makes
for empire-building, and may engender
yes-men.
The three key jobs are Foreign Sec-
retary, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and
Minister for Defence. You need big men
for all three, men with brains and guts.
The Foreign Secretary, above all, must
be able to stand up to pressure from
members of his party, lobbies and the
volume of work. He must have no
favorites or betes noires among the
countries of the world, and be strong
enough to deal with anybody who tries
to impose one on him. Diplomats are
a clever lot, and a Foreign Secretary
need know no language except his own:
Ernie Bevin didn’t even bother to pro-
nounce M. Ramadier: he always called
him Remedier. But he must know what’s
going on.
The Chancellor must also be a strength
and standing in the party, able to
influence his spending Ministers and tell
them where to get off. He needn’t be an
economic expert — the main thing is to
know enough to stop economists blind-
ing him with science. And the Minister
for Defence must be neutral to all ser-
vices and show it—not, of course, the
neutrality of an all-round ignorance, but
of motive. He needn’t know much about
war, or care for it particularly.
Too much knowledge is a dubious
asset. For instance, an excellent Minister
for Agriculture was Tom Williams, who
was no expert at it: Tory landowners in
the job have accomplished little.
The Cabinet usually meets once a
week. The Prime Minister shouldn’t
speak too much himself in Cabinet. He
should start the show or ask somebody
else to do so, and then intervene only
to bring out the more modest chaps who,
despite their seniority, might say nothing
if not asked. And the Prime Minister
must sum up. It is essential for the
Cabinet to move on, leaving in its wake a
trail of clear, crisp decisions. This is what
government is about. And the challenge
to democracy is how to get it done
quickly.

Down to the sea
in ships...
BRAMBLES HELPS FOSTER
A NEW INDUSTRY
The revitalising of small industries is essential to
national development, and any exhibition of enter-
prise on the part of any section of Australian busi-
ness or industry to foster national development
should be recognised.
Pearl shell carrier “Kuri Pearl" on sea trials. The ship was con-
structed by Carrington Shipways Pty. Ltd.
The small ships construction industry is one
which has developed dramatically. Due principally
to the ingenuity of naval architects Eken and
Doherty, an impressive number of small ships have
recently been launched in the Newcastle area, which
may well have been lost to overseas shipyards.
Just afloat! The .self-propelled oil-fuel bunkering bitrge "Esso Bee"
built by A. B. Rea Construction Pty. Ltd., Cockle Creek.
Eken and Doherty examined closely construc-
tion methods employed on steel-hulled ships during
the two World Wars. From their studies they
evolved methods of small ship design and fabrica-
tion based on the scale lofting method and forms
capable of development. This fresh approach in
ship design has enabled structural engineers and
small shipyards in the Newcastle area to under-
take the construction of vessels which would have
been traditionally regarded as the province of the
well equipped and larger shipyards.
The Brambles Group shared in this enterprising
venture through its steel merchandising unit, M &
B Steel & Engineering Supplies Pty Ltd. With
modern steel handling facilities at both Newcastle
and Sydney, the firm was able to assist in every
way through the supply of steel requirements;
fostering the growth of this promising industry.


The Record goes to the Heavyweights...
A 70-ton crane girder on a Brambles low loader at Newcastle. The girder was consigned to Whyalla.
The Brambles Industrial Services heavyweight
floats of up to 74 wheels can claim as many records
as some of the great heavyweights of the boxing
ring. So often a heavy haulage job presents a new
problem; the load’s a little longer, a little heavier
— but every time the experts see it through.
Twelve recent loads aggregated more than 1,000
tons and, as the pictures show, were lifted at
widely separated points in Australia.
Brambles broke another record in moving a
pressure feed heater to the recently opened Vales
Point power station, near Newcastle. The job
began at Whyalla in South Australia, where a
74-wheeled road transport carried the largest single
load to leave Whyalla by road. The pressure feed
heater was 90 feet long and weighed nearly 72
tons. Eleven bridges between Whyalla and Port
Augusta had to be by-passed en route. Brambles
earthmoving equipment spent three days construct-
ing deviation tracks past the bridges. At Port
Augusta, the load was transferred to rail transport.
Brambles Industrial Services at Newcastle carried
the heater from rail at Wyee to the power station.
The pictures on this page tell the story of some
of the other heavy loads carried by Brambles
recently.

Recent weeks have seen the passing of three
valued staff members of Brambles Industrial
Services; two at Newcastle and one at Port
Kembla.
Cecil John Ernst, aged 55, was Transport
Superintendent at Newcastle. His manly char-
acter commanded the respect and friendship of
his clients and men. Appointed by the late Mr.
Allan Bramble, a pioneer of the company, Cec
was a representative opening batsman and
wicketkeeper for Newcastle in his leisure hours.
Charles Frederick Jaeger, aged 62, was one
of the old school of transport workers and an
expert in timber haulage and heavy lifts. Charles
was a popular and enthusiastic bowls player of
recent years.
George Somerville, aged 55, spent ten years
with Brambles at Port Kembla. George was
widely known and respected for his ability in
handling extra wide and long loads.
Sympathy from the whole of our Brambles
family is extended to the families of all three
men, who served the company well.
Specialised Export
Brambles in Sydney handled an
important “pilot” export to Hong
Kong for Stanton Pipes of Australia

Stanton’s received an order for
300 tons of cement-lined pipes for
delivery to the Hong Kong Public
Works Department. Brambles pro-
vided transport to ship’s side, export
documentation, sea freight and other
customs and shipping requirements.

winning another overseas market so
vital to Australia’s Export Action.

Three fork lifts of CHEP Pty Ltd, were called in to overcome a problem
on Sydney's new Gladesville Bridge. Paving slabs had to be lifted into
position after the hand railing had been erected. CHEP fork lift tracks,

Low Church:
Sydney Synod Split
Liberal v. Conservative Anglicans
By C. ASHTON
There can be little disagreement that
last week’s meetings of the Anglican
Synod in the Diocese of Sydney
jvere among the most turbulent in
Synod’s history. Because of this turbu-
lence the waters are still muddy. Some
tlergy and laymen believe the meetings
showed a continuance of the winds of
change towards “liberalism” in the
Diocese. The pessimists among the “lib-
erals,” say it has been a black month for
all non-Conservative Evangelical Angli-
,cans in New South Wales. Others believe
the most significant development was the
split among the Conservatives, who
openly clashed and no longer presented
the frozen wall of unanimity character-
istic of the heyday of the extreme Low
(Churchmen when their controlling
fody, The Anglican Church League,
fras mentioned only in hushed awe.
Over the whole scene sat the enig-
matic figure of the Archbishop, Hugh
Rowlands Gough. He suffered a reverse
when Synod turned its back on his most
courageous recommendation by rejecting
all forms of State Aid for diocesan
Church schools.
Here the Conservatives gained a great
factory. They knew that Standing Com-
mittee had adopted the recommendations
of the committee established by Dr
Gough and chaired by the Headmaster
of Shore School, Mr B. H. Travers
recommend" tions that Synod recorn-
mend the acceptance of the Federal
(science grants but accept no more unless
a referendum were held. They also
knew that Synod traditionally was
against State Aid (a fairly common
attitude among Evangelicals who tend
to be suspicious of anything that may
help the Roman Catholic Church). By
(252 votes to 203 Synod turned up its
nose at the Federal Government and
also at Dr Gough, who had said only
on Monday that he was unequivocally in
favor of accepting the Federal offer.
Was this purely a conservative vic-
tory? Not entirely, because others of
the more “liberal” group also suspected
the Federal offer and they felt there
Was some anxiety about the Travers
Committee’s conclusions.
: Then there was the vocal support for
|he anti-State Aiders from no less a
person than the senior coadjutor bishop,
the Rt. Rev. Clive Kerle, who said he
would not be “pressured” into accepting
State Aid. And, finally, Mr Francis
James of “The Anglican” newspaper
formed a strong though perhaps unholy
alliance against State Aid with Dr
Broughton Knox and the Rev. Donald
Robinson, of Moore Theological College
—men with whom he usually has little
in common.
It was in the debate on the diocesan
Promotion Department that the split
among the Conservatives became most
apparent. One well-known Evangelical,
the Rev. John Ross, of Liverpool,
launched an attack on the “narrow-
mindedness” of the Moore College
approach. He said many Moore College
graduates did not love people. The heat
over Promotion was caused by a Stand-
ing Committee recommendation that the
department be allotted £l5OO for its
work in the coming year. Last year
Standing Committee sought £3OOO, but
the Conservatives ganged up and threw
out financial aid entirely. This year
Bishop Kerle moved that the sum be
increased from £l5OO to £3OOO and
this was carried. The liberals interpreted
the result as a major step forward.
To what extent can these conclusions
be accepted? Another clergyman, of the
liberal school in Synod, feels that a split
among the Conservatives does not neces-
sarily mean a gain for the liberals. But
he does regard it as “a good sign”. Some
laymen say merely that there is a shift
of power at the top of diocesan admin-
istration, and that a new “party”
an Archbishop’s Party is developing,
while at the same time the diehard Evan-
gelical tradition will be maintained.
The pessimists in Sydney are to be
found mainly among the Middle to High
Church group, which appears to be
gaining strength, despite the tight hold
of Moore Theological College on the
flow of new priests into the Diocese.
These people include a number of
Moore College clergy who have rebelled.
They also include a large number of
Anglican laymen from other dioceses,
both in New South Wales and other
States, who come from a liberal Church
tradition and say they feel largely dis-
franchised in the Sydney Diocese. They
point to the election of Bishop Clive
Kerle, a dedicated Evangelical, as the
new Bishop of Armidale, and say that
what has been a middle-of-the-road
diocese may well become a second
Sydney on the northern tableland. These
gloomy Sydney Anglicans point also to
the appointment of new rectors to the
leading Eastern Suburbs parishes of St
Mark's, Darling Point, and All Saints’,
Woollahra, both of whom are acknow-
ledged as Low Churchmen of the Moore
College brand and this is strange in
Darling Point, which, churchmen say,
used to be regarded almost as High
Church and was expected to appoint a
well-known liberal, even if he had to be
brought in from another diocese.

High Church:
Onward and Upward
Not only in the "better suburbs "
By R. THOMAS WILLIAMS
Tue date is August 15. It is 7 a.m.
The scene is an historic old blue-
stone church, not 300 yards from
the heart of downtown Melbourne. St
Patrick’s Cathedral is only the width of
a street away. Inside the church, a priest,
deacon and sub-deacon, in richly em-
broidered white and gold eucharistic
vestments are celebrating High Mass.
The notice on the church door says that
the Mass is for the Feast of the Assump-
tion of the Blessed Virgin Mary. A
troupe of servers, a thurifer and other
acolytes in scarlet cassocks and white
cottas are assisting the priests. The air
is thick with the pungent smell of
incense. The congregation piously make
the Sign of the Cross at the required
times, and genuflect as the Holy Name is
said. A bell is rung to call the people
to adoration at the consecration of the
Blessed Sacrament.
Paintings of the saints and the
Stations of the Cross hang on the side
walls. A stoup stands near the entrance
so that the congregation may sign them-
selves as they enter and leave the church.
In the south-east corner is a con-
fessional. In the north-east corner is a
Shrine dedicated to Our Lady. The altar
is the focal point of the church. It has
a frontal of heavy wine-red material. On
it, beside the Altar Cards and the Missal
Stand, is a large crucifix. Behind it is
the Tabernacle. Six tall, thick candles
signify that a Solemn Mass is in progress.
A statue of Christ, with outstretched
hands is above the altar in a sumptuous
apse.
To the casual onlooker, only one thing
indicates that the church is not Roman
Catholic—a pile of “The Anglican”
newspapers on a bookstand in the
entrance porch.
The church is Saint Peter’s, Church of
England, Eastern Hill, since last century
the unofficial centre of Anglo-Catholi-
cism in the Diocese of Melbourne, and
symbolic of a Movement within the
Anglican Church which has grown signi-
ficantly in influence and popularity since
its beginnings in the first half of the
19th century.
Unlike Christ Church St Laurence, its
counterpart in Sydney, St Peter’s is not
an isolated outpost in a largely “Low”
Church diocese. The Liturgical Move-
ment is not uncommon in Melbourne,
and there are more than a dozen “High”
churches in the suburbs, supplemented
by at least an equal number in rural
dioceses. (The Liturgical Movement is
the contemporary name applied to the
restoration of Catholic doctrine and
ritual to the Anglican Church.) At
Brunswick, an inner Melbourne indus-
trial suburb, Saint Cuthbert’s Church is
on a par, if not “Higher” than St Peter’s;
and All Saints’ and St James the Great,
are two churches of “High” reputation
within walking distance of each other at
the seaside suburb of East St Kilda. At
Alphington, a north-eastern suburb,
St Jude's Church has a similar reputa-
tion.
Contrary to some lines of thought
within the Church of England, (and
without) the Anglo-Catholic churches are
not, generally speaking, situated in the
better suburbs where they would be
claimed as “status symbols”! The
“highest” of the churches —St Peter’s
and St Cuthbert’s—-are certainly not
situated in, or surrounded by, exclusive
suburbs. In fact, St John’s Church,
Toorak, and Christ Church, South Yarra
could hardly be described as “high”
church. An exception to the rule, how-
ever, is St Andrew’s in the fashionable
bayside suburb of Brighton, although it
isn’t as “high” as some churches.
To most non-Anglicans, and indeed
to some within the Church, the Liturgical
Movement is all very mystifying. But
judging by the present situation it seems
obvious that the Movement is increasing
in appeal and popularity. One of the
newest churches to be built in the Mel-
bourne diocese is All Saints’ at Foots-
cray, another industrial suburb, and
every indication has it that the church
will be another outlet for the Liturgical
Movement. Coincidentally, nearby St
George the Martyr’s, West Footscray,
was once the parish of the Reverend
Geoffrey Taylor, the present Vicar of
St Peter’s, Eastern Hill, and he, of
course is a dedicated Anglican Catholic.
Father Taylor was inducted and installed
as Vicar of St Peter’s in July following
the retirement of Canon Farnham May-
nard (author of “The Continuity of the
Church of England”) and he has pledged
to continue to see that his church, “is
a bright and shining light for the Catho-
lic Faith in Australia, and beyond”.
On Sunday mornings at High Mass ini
St Peter's, it is hard for newcomers to
imagine that they are in an Anglican
church. Among the congregation are
nuns from the St Kilda Convent of the
Sisters of the Church, who run St
Michael’s CEGGS, and the service is
from “The English Mass”, not the
familiar Book of Common Prayer. “The
English Mass”, was especially compiled
for St Peter's, and closely follows an-
cient and traditional liturgical form, 1
The Eleven O’clock Matins are relegated
to 8.45, jammed in between the eight
o’clock and 9.30 masses. Evensong
becomes Solemn Evensong, and is usu-
ally preceded by a procession complete
with banners and incense. When the
Prayer Book is used, the 1928 Version
suffices, although officially it has been
rejected by the Church of England. It
was an abortive attempt by moderate
high churchmen to broaden the scope
of the Prayer Book, with the addition
of two new services, and alternatives to
the 1662 forms of Matins, Evensong and
Holy Communion. As well, it contains
more Collects, Epistles and Gospels, etc.,
for an increased number of Holy Days,
and has cleaned up ambiguous rubrics.
Jazz Mass
A familiar figure at Mass, usually as
Deacon, is the Reverend Doctor Barry
Marshall, Chaplain of Trinity College,
University of Melbourne, another for-
tress of Anglo-Catholicism. The students
at Trinity occasionally stage a Jazz Mass
(now well-known by courtesy of the
ABC) which replaces the 8.15 a.m. Mass
on Sundays, and this illustrates in a
way that there is nothing stuffy or iron-
thumbed about the Liturgical Movement.
It also serves to point out the assurance
of continuity for the Movement, especi-
ally with such ardent followers among
young people. Even in painfully “Low”
Church Sydney, St Paul’s College at the
Sydney University is under the watchful
eyes of its warden, Father Peter Bennie,
whose devotion to the Movement is as
well known in his native “High” Church
Brisbane, as its climate.
The Australian Church Union strives
to keep the fires of Anglo-Catholicism
burning brightly, along with the Confra-
ternity of the Blessed Sacrament, whose
Superior in Melbourne (Ward of St
Mary) is Father Geoffrey Taylor. As
well, the “Parish and People” Movement
helps stimulate interest in Anglo-
Catholicism, but on a less intellectual
and theological plane. Its top suppor-
ters include Father Bennie and Dr Mar-
shall. The ACU recently celebrated the
success of the Liturgical Movement,
with a Solemn Eucharist (polite term for
High Mass) at Christ Church St Lau-


rence, Sydney, “in commemoration of
the Catholic Revival in the Church of
England”.
The various religious communities
within the Church of England in Aus-
tralia, although not well-known outside
of it, help emphasise its “Catholic
image”, and thus indirectly, and some-
times only by the fact of their existence,
aid the growth of the Liturgical Move-
ment.
Liturgical Movement
The Sisters of the Church, the Holy
Name and the Sacred Advent, the
Brotherhoods of The Good Shepherd,
St Andrew, St Barnabas, etc., and the
Societies of St Francis and of the Sacred
Mission, are all helping to firmly estab-
lish and give maturity to the Liturgical
Movement.
As the Liturgical Movement increases
its expansion in Australia, it will at the
same time bring with it many problems.
—problems which the Church in
England is already encountering, and
not without uneasiness. Just one
example is the appointment of a “high”
church priest to an Evangelical parish,
or vice versa. The difficulties and pre-
judices which could arise are not difficult
to foresee. And when the Church finally
gets around to publishing the long
awaited Australian Prayer Book, con-
troversy is sure to arise from both Anglo-
Catholic and Evangelical camps—one
condemning the Book as too “protty”,
and the other voicing its objections with
the standard catchcry “popery”. These
and many other difficulties which are
stire to arise will have to be met with
calmness and commonsense on the part
of the Church hierarchy, for the future
of the Church of England will be at
stake.
These divisions within the Church of
England are often the source of much
amusement, puzzlement, and sometimes
of concern to non-Anglicans and Angli-
cans alike. But a statement made in

“The co-existence of these divergent
views within the Anglican Communion
sets up certain tensions, but these are
tensions within a wide range of agree-
ment in faith and practice ... we
acknowledge them to be the will of God
for us, since we believe that it is only
through a comprehensiveness which
makes it possible to hold together in the
Anglican Communion, understandings of
truths which are held in separation in
other churches ... If at present one view
Were to prevail to the exclusion of all
others, we should be delivered from all
our tensions, but only at the expense of
missing our opportunity, and our voca-
tion.”

Oz Defence Appeal
SIR. —Without reflecting on the merits
of the case one way or another, there
are many people who feel that the young
defendants in the Oz appeal should be
entitled to the most expert legal assist-
ance. Such assistance is necessarily ex-
pensive and beyond the means of the
editors of Oz. There are probably many
people in the community who would
care to offer practical and immediate
financial aid. Therefore the undersigned
are launching an Oz Legal Defence
Appeal. All donations should be made

Eric Butler
SIR.—Mr Eric D. Butler’s letter (The
Bulletin, 17/10/64), denying that he
has penned anti-Semitic articles and pam-
phlets can only be described as dis-
ingenuous. It is true that in the post-
war period he has dropped to some
extent the extremely crude approach
which typified his pamphlets of the
early ’forties, e.g., “The part played by
Jewish International Finance in the estab-
lishment of the present Slave State in
Russia has been dealt with time and
time again . . . This menace of collectiv-
ism, or bolshevisation, which now
threatens the entire civilised world, is
essentially Jewish.” (“The World Govern-
ment Plot Exposed!”, p. 6.). Does he
mean that he has now repudiated his in-
famous work “The International Jew:
The Truth About The Protocols of Zion”,
published soon after the close of the
Second World War. “The International
Jew” has no logic other than hatred of
the Jewish people. Readers are told that
Christ was not a Jew and that all Jews
should be deported to Madagascar. Mr
Butler also alleges that “Hitler’s policy
was a Jewish policy; it helped further
the declared aims of International
Jewry ...”
Let us now look at Mr Butler's more
recent “The Story of Twenty Years of
Character Assassination” (1960), in
which he repeatedly suggests that the
“International Jews” started the Second


World War (p. 17). Mr Butler continues:
“I do want to make it clear that the
constant repetition of the statement that
the Germans murdered six million Jews
is without doubt one of the most frighten-
ing examples of the successful use of the
big lie technique ...” (pp. 17-18.)
The unsigned articles which appear in
Mr Butler's two journals— “New Times”
and “Intelligence Survey” contain the
same vicious nonsense. Here are just
three examples:
(1) “Ever since their active participa-
tion in the crucifixion of Christ the Jew-
ish leaders have worked ceaselessly to
undermine the Christian faith. Today the
Zionist Jews, who have played a domi-
nant role in building up the international
finance system, use every convenient
instrument to further their ends.” (“New
Tmes”, 26/9/1947.)
(2) “What is meant by the word
gentleman does not exist among Jews.
The genuine Jew fails in this innate good
breeding by which alone individuals
honor their own individuality and respect
that of others.” (“New Times”,
12/9/1958.)
(3) “ . . . Jews provide the biggest
percentage of Communist agents and the
smallest percentage of anti-Communist
leaders . . . The very fact that every
effort is made to ignore the vital role
played by Jews in the Communist espion-
age systems, is of itself striking evidence
of the widespread belief that Jewish
power is no myth. People who attempt
to discuss national and international
politics as if this Jewish power does not
exist, are either very naive or they are
very frightened.” (“New Times ’,
16/6/1962.)
In addition, Mr Butler’s two journals
cite approvingly long extracts from such
well-known anti-Semitic journals as “Can-
dour” (UK), “Common Sense” (USA),
and “Canadian Intelligence Survey”.
For thirty years, Mr Butler has pushed
the line that the Jews control both Inter-
national Communism and International
Finance, with the aim of destroying
“Western Civilisation” and setting up the
Jewish-dominated World Slave State. The
Jews are also held responsible for both
World Wars in this century, the Russian
Revolution of 1917, the Great Depres-
sion of the 19305, Hitler's rise to power,
the disintegration of the British Empire
and the establishment of the Teague
of Nations and the United Nations. To
buttress these fantastic arguments he falls
back not only on the writings of
other well-known anti-Semites, invariably
described as “militant Christian Patriots”,
but also on the forged “Protocols of the
Learned Elders of Zion”, copies of which
adorn the shelves of his Melbourne book-
shop.
It is specious for Mr Butler to deny
that he is anti-Semitic.

REVIEWS
MUSIC
The Italian Vice
By JOHN SMALL
Macbeth. Verdi. Elizabethan Trust
Opera Company. Elizabethan
Theatre, Sydney.
Five British Concerts. Sydney.
TjV>R Verdi, unlike Wagner, opera is
essentially about human beings. In
his works, as in most Italian opera, the
voice takes pride of place, and the
orchestra's role is restricted to providing
an accompaniment for the arias, duets,
choruses, and to giving emphasis to
events on-stage at other times.
This approach has its dangers. The
typically Italian vices are to treat the
set pieces as vehicles for vocal display,
to ignore their dramatic function, and
to subordinate the orchestra so com-
pletely to the voice that the accompani-
ments have almost no musical interest.
These tendencies can be found in
Verdi's “Macbeth”. Some numbers are
almost grotesquely inappropriate from a
dramatic point of view—notably the
music accompanying Duncan’s entry,
and the assassin's chorus. The orches-
tra is often treated perfunctorily,
merely to provide a kind of Alberti bass.
But “Macbeth” transcends these limi-
tations, thanks to Verdi’s superb drama-
tic sense and inventiveness as a melo-
dist. In his hands, set pieces become
nodal points in the drama. This
applies even to the waltzes with which
the first two acts conclude. The fact
that the music of these pieces is hardly
“appropriate” becomes largely irrele-
vant when set beside the dramatic im-
pact that Verdi’s melodic power gives
them.
In this respect, and in his use of the
orchestra for dramatic effect outside
the set pieces, Verdi's methods remained
unchanged throughout his career. What
makes “Falstaff” greater than “Mac-
beth” is not a capitulation to Wagnerian
ideals by Verdi in the half century that
separates the two operas, but Verdi’s
greater mastery.
The producer’s function in “Macbeth”
consists largely of the thankless task of
keeping the singers well down-stage, and
making sure that the tableaux do not
become completely immobile. Stefan
Beinl did this well, and gave the pro-
duction an effectiveness which makes it
rank after Haag’s production of “Cosi
Fan Tutte” as one of the most accom-
plished of the Trust’s current season.
He was assisted by an imaginative set,
which divided stage space up effectively
(although it was insecure and awkward
for the singers to walk on).
Musically, the production maintained
the level of achievement set throughout
the season. Neil Warren Smith was
outstanding as Banquo, and Robert
Allman, who played Macbeth, sang ex-
cellently. As Lady Macbeth, Tais Taras
displayed little acting ability but an im-
pressive voice. The orchestra, under
Walter Stiasny, was generally reliable.
HThe series of five British concerts
A arranged by the ABC for Sydney’s
British Fortnight contained some of the
best and some of the dullest music heard
at concerts this year. Most of the dull
music—among which was Delius’ effu-
sive cello sonata, some decorous and
ineffectual settings of Shakespeare by
Finzi, and a constipated song cycle by
Vaughan Williams —came from the
twentieth-century, and a casual listener
could well have got the impression that
modern British music is generally unin-
teresting and not very forward-looking.
This underlines the fact that the
modern music selected for this series
of concerts was not representative of
what the best British composers have
been doing in recent years. There was,
for instance, no music by Searle. Tippett,
Hamilton, Rawsthorne, Rubbra or
Tutyens, any of whose works would
have been preferable to those mentioned
above, if only because the music of these
composers is still practically unknown
here.
However, a number of the other
modern works performed were of great
interest, including Britten’s terse, ener-
getic cello sonata, splendidly performed
by James Whitehead and Lance Dossor,
and “A Knot of Riddles”, by Bliss, the
performance of which ought to encour-
age renewed interest in this unjustly
neglected composer, whose gifts are in
many ways like Britten’s.
The most “advanced” works per-
formed were Peter Maxwell Davies’ “O
Magnum Mysterium”, and Harrison
Birtwistle’s “Music for Sleep”. The lat-
ter work consists of three songs set in


fairly conventional style, with instru-
mental episodes that leave timing to the
performers. Generally, the choral
writing sounded monotonous compared
with the lively instrumental sections,
whose effect seemed to have been much
more carefully calculated: and all the
music, choral and instrumental, sounded
thin-textured. However, the techniques
used in the work made it of great inter-
est, especially as it was written for, and
performed by, schoolchildren.
THEATRE
Mediocrity
The Roaring Twenties. Her Majesty’s
Theatre, Melbourne.
TJarry Wren’s “Roaring Twenties”
topples into sentimental mediocrity
with a series of disjointed acts, most of
which, individually, would raise only a
few heads in a nightclub.
There is but the sketchiest attempt
to marry any of the numbers, sung and
danced by a leggy but unenthusiastic
chorus, with the “Twenties” theme.
Bill French, uncomfortable in his new
stage role, lends what support he can,
and Tony Weston, a bright Londoner,
battles energetically with his blue-tinted
material.
On the credit side goes an outstand-
ing slackwire act by the Feller Brothers
and Dodo, the prodigious tap dancing of
Barry Munro, and Eddie Garson’s ven-
triloquy. A pity he must steal lines
from top American comedians.

‘T'he Royal Family” is a collection of
A satirical situations contrived from
the lives of Richard Burton and Eliza-
beth Taylor by Kermit Schafer, an
American radio and TV producer. The
props are the most obvious and mostly
tedious. Liz’s many husbands, her
money, her adopted religion and Eddie
Fisher are used to the fullest extent in
this performance by a mediocre group
called the Triangle Players—Dick Ster-
ling, Ray Baumel and Gina Wilson
tvho receive predictable laughs from the
recording-studio audience.
John Ashe says disarmingly: “I can't
sing for nuts, but brother do I like sing-
ing.” The accountant from Townsville
recorded a dozen satirical bush ballads
for his album “Come in Spinner”, which
is also the title for a song of praise for
our national gambling game. There are
flamin’ fights and the flamin’ boose and
the flamin’ Kellys, but nothing really
wild to match the flamboyant, primitive
reverie of a Chad Morgan composition.
John Ashe’s songs are more in the tra-
dition of Gunn’s Gully and will find wide
acceptance as samples of Australian bush
comedy. The cover photograph shows
a group of two-up players, masked for
legal security.
Frank Ifield, another Australian but
better known in the cities, sings a col-
lection of old favorites for his “Blue
Skies” recording: “Blue Skies”, “Dark
Moon”, “You Came a Long Way from
St Louis”, “Tumbling Tumbleweeds”,
“I’ll Be Around”, “My Blue Heaven”,
“Sweet Lorraine”, “I’m Sorry”, “Who
Cares”, “Make it Soon” and “I’ve Got
You Under My Skin”. Ifield has a plea-
sant, clear voice and is one of the few
who can change to falsetto without
making one's flesh creep.

TTobert Hossein, already established as
an actor, has branched out he
directs “Les Scelerats” as well as starring
and collaborating on the screenplay.
For his first excursion into direction
Hossein has adopted a pace only slightly
faster than that of a glacier. Except in
the dismally unconvincing wild party
sequence—Hossein is no Fellini his
actors, himself included, move as if
swimming in treacle.
A pair of rich Americans living in
Paris so fascinate a French girl that she
gets herself employed as their maid of
all work. But she finds that their appear-
ance of confident happiness is a sham:
the beautiful wife is a neurotic drunkard
who accuses her glum husband of being
a killer or, as Michele Morgan’s
English is fluent but accented, a Keeler.
But by the time we're let into the secret,
we really don’t care very much.
Michele Morgan’s sensitive, under-
standing performance, and her great
physical beauty, irradiate the film, even
if they can’t quite manage to bring it
to life. Hossein seems too preoccupied
with his new directing job to spare much
effort for the role of the long-suffering
husband (whose habit of ostentatiously
drinking milk must have been a constant
irritation to his alcoholic wife).
Hossein’s use of the clumsy device of
an off-screen narrator is pardonable to
some extent, since Perette Pradier, play-
ing the maid through whose eyes we see
the tragic drama, is incapable of any
expression but dumb surliness; so it’s
useful to hear the disembodied voice
explaining “Louise thought . . . Louise
realised . . .”.
The credit titles of the mysterious
film “One Plus One” divulge nothing
but its name and that of its producer-
director Arch Oboler, and the informa-
tion that it’s presented by something
called Fluorite Ltd. It’s a collection of
“real-life” sketches illustrating some of
the conclusions of the Kinsey Report,
and is very moral and very badly acted.
I don’t know where this was made, or
when—after all, who talks about Kinsey
nowadays? And where on earth is a
19-inch screen referred to as “king-size
television”?
“To Trap A Spy” must be the world's
most expensive television pilot—feature
length, and in color. A new series
starring the same people, called “The
Man From U.N.C.L.E.” has recently
made its debut on American TV.
Judging by this film, it is as improbable
as the James Bond stories or “The
Avengers”, without any of their irrever-
ent humor. But Don Medford’s direction
is efficient and sleek, and Jerry Gold-
smith’s musical score lends an un-
deserved excitement to the proceedings.

relationships between shapes and colors.
His output is not large (the sketches and
collages tend to be used as padding) but
he has taken a long look at every piece,
and each one repays a long look.
For the most part he derives his
shapes and compositions from the ever
fruitful landscape. However, there is no
haze in this landscape. Everything has a
clear edge, though rarely a straight one.
Thus are assembled in very strong,
sharply outlined contrast and bright
color the basic geometric elements of
nature, the circle of the sun or a water-
hole, the line of the horizon, the angular
shapes of rocks and trees. But at this
point the landscape bows out. Keys
concentrates on balancing his form and
color. He approaches large shapes as
closely as their tension created by their
outlines will allow, or he sets them wide
apart so that they intrude on and move
the central space. Occasionally what to
him is variety to others will seem repeti-
tition, but on the whole it is thoughtful
work which succeeds in communicating
the ideas which prompt it.
Exhibiting with David Keys is the
potter Peter Laycock, whose stoneware
is quite well-known even though this is
the first time he has shown it in a gallery.
It is admirably simple, unpretentious
pottery (Laycock insists that it is craft
not art) designed for domestic use and
priced for domestic budgets There is
no need to be solemn about whether it
is craftsmanship or artistry. One could
not ask for more cleanly shaped, grace-
ful objects for daily use. Generally the
more decorative glazes are less pleasing
than the quite plain pots, but in all his
work the forms are finely judged and
executed.

HPhe second part of Bob Raymond’s
A documentary on Britain had much
the same virtues and faults as “Britain
Today”. Deftly assembled, visually
pleasing (though not as impressive as
the first) and never less than interesting
to watch, it was finally unsatisfying: the
individual segments never added up to
a clear picture of Britain’s future.
Raymond spent too much time on
speculation as to the result of the general
election, which at the time of viewing
was Britain almost literally tomorrow,
and on interviews with the rival leaders,
making the windy promises of politicians
the world over; and the producer con-
centrated on the aircraft industry to such
an extent that it seemed to be the onljj
one Britain had.
On the other hand, some important
influences in the nation’s development
were barely touched on. The influx of (
colored migrants was passed over lightly
with the information that some people
liked them and some didn’t. The con-
gestion on Britain’s roads was airily dis-
missed with some handsome shots of
new, half-empty motorways (taken pre-
sumably at an offpeak period) no 1
reference to the mile-after-mile traffic
jams that occur on any public holiday.
The sequences about the necessary
revolution in education were tantalisingly
short. Particularly interesting was the
interview with the headmaster of a
modern co-educational school, who said
firmly that the school had “no moral
problems”, although pupils stay there
up to the age of 18.
He dismissed the interviewer’s attempt
to sell him the Australian idea of Parents
and Citizens’ Associations with a scorn-
ful: “It’s rather a case of the tail wagging
the dog, isn’t it?”
The programme also included inter-
views with the two inevitables, Malcolm
Muggeridge and the Duke of Bedford.
Neither had anything very stimulating to
say, but His Grace, in speaking of thej
modern breaking-down of class barriers,
gave a fine example of old-fashioned
snobbery. “I was brought up among
the servants,” he said. “That’s why I
can understand the man in the street.”
“Studio A” continues its chequered
career, showing little improvement for
all its changes of producers and com-
peres. Australian television producers
don’t seem to have the flair for variety,
programmes, and are still hopefully
stringing together songs, dances and
comic turns in the hope that somehow
they’ll add up to a show.
A prime fault is in the over-elaborate
sets, particularly for dance numbers; and
the choreographers still seem to live itn
the days of Busby Berkeley and Alber-
tina Rasch. Overseas choreographers
(notably Danny Kaye’s Tony Charmoli)
have shown that an appearance of lavish-
ness and elegance comes from a combi-
nation of simplicity and imagination —
not to mention dancers who are wellj
trained and above all properly rehearsed.
One recent “Studio A” show was
an evocation of the ’twenties (again!),
and though there were some competent
performers, there was a sad lack of
style or wit. The latest compere is Dave
Reid, a bumbling, puppyish fellow
pathetically anxious to win approval
But he hasn’t the talent to rise above
some ancient material that might well
defeat even a Kaye or a Silvers.

AUSTRALIAN BOOKS
Heroes, Villains and Sacred Cows
A survey of publications on sale
during Australian Book Week
By LEONIE KRAMER
rTHE latest battle of the books, provoked by Penguin Books’
rejection of Geoffrey Dutton’s anthology “Australian New
Writing”, smacks more of gang warfare than responsible
literary debate; and the criticisms uttered by the Penguin
reader, Francis Hope, must make even the most patriotic of
us, especially on the eve of Australian Book Week, take stock
of our realisable assets. If we do so honestly, we will
immediately have to make one admission. This has not been
a good year for fiction. With the exception of George
Johnston’s “My Brother Jack” and Peter Cowan’s “Summer”,
very few novels of merit have been published.
Yet 1964 has been, for all that, an exciting one for readers
of poetry. It has seen the publication of Angus and Robert-
son’s two - volume anthology, edited by
T. Inglis Moore and Douglas Stewart, which,
it has just been announced, is also to be
published in the United States. Then there have been individual
volumes of poetry of unusual interest.
A selection made from these volumes, supplemented by
poems from writers who have not published books this year
—■ say Judith Wright, A. D. Hope, Rosemary Dobson and
Vincent Buckley, to name a few would satisfy the most
fastidious critic. It would also, I suggest, find interested
readers not only in England but also in America and Canada.
It does not seem to me necessary to spring to the defence
of Australian writers in this controversy, because the fault
is not with the writers, but with their critics, many of whose
assumptions will not bear inspection. One of the most
unfortunate aspects of the present argument is that it has
raised yet again, and in particularly ludicrous form, the
question of world standards. How long must we go on
invoking this mythical measure? Mr Hope claims that
Dutton’s anthology does not measure up to world standards;
at the same time, admitting ignorance of Australian
literature, he takes his own standards from “The London
Magazine”, which, to say the least of it, is to set one’s literary
sights dangerously low. He then taxes Australian writers with
the “vices of parochialism”; yet strangely enough, from this
side of the equator, the charge of parochialism seems entirely
appropriate to “The London Magazine”. The trouble is that
people Who talk about world standards in this way more often
than not mean, as Mr Hope seems to mean, the standards of
the world they know. But if the phrase “world standards”
means anything at all, it does so only in terms of the kind of
notion Matthew Arnold had in mind when he talked of “the
best that has been known and thought in the world” a
standard in one’s own mind derived from experience of the
best literature, a standard which ought to make Mr Hope
sceptical of the local values upon which he bases his judgments.
This affair marks, too, the recurrence of another critical
malady which has far too long afflicted this country the
creation of heroes, villains and sacred cows.
At present our longest-lived sacred cow is
Patrick White. Along with A. D. Hope,
McAuley, Judith Wright and Randolph Stow he escapes
Mr Hope’s attack. Now it does not seem at all obvious to
me that because all these writers have written well, they must
be expected never to descend from the sublime. In the rejected
Dutton anthology White is represented by his short story
“Down at the Dump”. I do not happen to think that White
is a great short-story writer, or even a particularly good one;
and I certainly think that “Down at the Dump” is one of the
worst stories he has written. I am surprised at Dutton choosing
it; still more surprised at the Penguin editor and reader praising
it; and tempted to wonder whether by any other name it would
have smelt quite so sweet.
In short, my concern is not for our writers. Those who
deserve to survive will survive without any assistance from
their critics. My concern is for the strange and inconsistent
noises which are now being made in the name of criticism.
Where one should find reasonable discourse, one finds instead
name - calling, the creation of hierarchies and premature
canonizations. But in spite of it all perhaps we can still enjoy
Australian Book Week. We might be at the bottom of the
class this coming week, but with criticism the way it is at
the moment, we could easily be at the top the next. And
anyway we kept the Ashes.

11/hen the last historian has raked
through the cold ashes of field-
marshals’ and politicians’ memoirs, diplo-
matic documents and official military
chronicles the most convincing picture
of what the First World War was really
like will still be found in a handful of
books of which “Her Privates We” is
one.
Frederic Manning’s novel is a remark-
able tour-de-force. Manning himself
Was an expatriate Australian, a scholar,
delicate in health and “fastidious to the
point of foppishness”, who enlisted as a
private in a British infantry regiment. He
had nothing in common with his com-
rades in the ranks. Their language,
their philosophy of life and the environ-
ments from which they came were
utterly alien to him. Yet no other writer
ever evoked with such understanding the
battered, unconquerable human dignity
of the ordinary soldier in the most abys-
mally degrading conditions that soldiers
were ever called upon to endure.
When “Her Privates We” first ap-
peared in 1930 it was hailed as one of
the few great war books in any language.
That was the immediate reaction of cri-
tics who had shared the experiences of
the then anonymous author, “Private
19022”; men who had stumbled with
him across the shell-cratered landscape
of the Somme, huddled with him in
waterlogged trenches, picked lice from
their clothing with him, drunk with him
in estaminets, suffered with him the
same long periods of stupefying boredom
punctuated by moments of agonising
fear. In the voices of Martlow, Shem,
the Weeper and the others Manning’s
contemporaries heard the ghosts of their
dead mates and the echoes of them-
selves. It was this extraordinary authen-
ticity that set the book so high above
most war fiction. It is the same quality
that makes it still so moving today.
“Her Privates We” is one of those
novels, few and far between, that haunt


the imagination long after the last page
is turned. Ot no work of fiction pro-
duced by World War II could that be
said.
Manning's story is the simple account
of the experiences of a group of infantry-
men during the Somme offensive of
1916. The Somme has been justly
described as the graveyard of Kitchen-
er’s volunteer army. During those five
summer and autumn months Britain lost
400,000 men in bloody and futile efforts
to break the deadlock on the Western
Front. Regiments were losing their old
territorial character as the first flood of
Derby Scheme conscripts poured in to
fill the shattered ranks. With them came
officers who were, well, hang it all, not
quite ... A revolution in British military
tradition was being forged on the anvil
of Mars. Only the generals remained.
Manning’s characters are survivors of
the old brigade, though why they volun-
teered few of them can now say. King
and Country have become the catch-
words of a civilian world, a world from
which they feel completely detached.
Time has become almost meaningless,
measured out not by weeks and months
but by spells in the front line and spells of
apathetic torpor or drunken forgetful-
ness at the rear. They have given up
speculating when the war will end.
Perhaps it will never end. War has
become normality and the only way to
cheat death is to cop a good “blighty”
wound.
Private Bourne, the central figure, is
obviously Manning himself —an educa-
ted, sensitive, introspective man who has
been impelled by some unexplained rea-
son to avoid a commission and enlist in
the ranks. He is something of a pedant
and an intellectual snob, though his
snobbery is directed at his superiors
rather than his comrades. Bourne knows
that by rights he should be among the
gentlemen and in the end, shortly before
his death, he grudgingly consents to
apply for a commission. In the meantime
he has no compunction about filching
wine reserve pour les officiers because, as
he explains, the average officer wouldn’t
know the difference between a decent vin-
tage and the roughest vin ordinaire.
Private Bourne, the square peg who
has deliberately planted himself in a
round hole, could, in fact, be a distinctly
unsympathetic character. He might have
been merely effete, enjoying the delicious
coarseness and vulgarity of the herd.
But he is not. There is no hint of
patronage in Bourne’s attitude to his
companions. He is amused by them,
occasionally bewildered by them, but his
dominant emotion is one of deep affec-
tion and respect. In them he senses the
real stuff of humanity, and he sees them
all as rich and sharply-defined indivi-
duals.
That to Bourne-Manning is the
miracle —that men driven to their fate in
monstrous uncomprehending masses still
remain separate identities, each man
carrying his private hell of fears, his
hopes and delusions. No doubt it is a
naively obvious view, but Manning
makes out of it one of the noblest testa-
ments to the human spirit ever written.
“War is waged by men; not by beasts,
or by gods,” he says. There was beastli-
ness enough on the Somme battlefield;
bodily filth and mental degradation
enough; savagery enough, too. But,
though men were destructible, man was
not. Perhaps that is one reason for our
nostalgic interest in wars of the past,
especially the war of 1914-18, the last in
which a man and not a weapon was the
real modulator of the conflict. We have
only too much reason to fear that the
next war will prove that man is destruc-
tible as well as men.
Manning had a fine ear for dialogue
and his characters emerge in their
speech as vividly credible human figures.
And it is all done with scarcely a four-
letter word. The men are too tired for
heroic gestures, too tired even for anger
except in fitful spasms when they see a
mate disembowelled by a shell or the
promised rum ration fails to arrive.
Their conversation is a monotone of
minor grievances; mud, rats, smells, ver-
min and sergeant-majors are worse foes
than the Hun because omnipresent. Yet,
from this unheroic soldiers’ argot, Man-
ning builds up gallery of portraits that
a lesser artist could not achieve in pages
of psychological explanation.
GEOFFREY SCOTT
From an Unknown
Country
Australian Poetry, 1964. Selected by
Randolph Stow. Angus and Robert-
son. 15s.
Tn compiling “Australian Poetry, 1964”,
Randolph Stow has taken the more
honorable of the alternatives open to
editors. He has aimed at good verse
rather than a good anthology.
A novelist and poet himself, Mr Stow
obviously has no need to play those card-
shuffling games whereby editors give
themselves delusions of creativeness.
Apart from the modest placing of his
own contribution at the end, the volume
shows small sign of being arranged at
all. Equally, I feel sure, Mr Stow has
disdained the editorial infirmity of pur-
pose which tries for a “representative”
selection. Fifty-one poets (possessing
between them fifty-two names the
blurb discloses that Gwen Harwood and
Francis Geyer are one and the same
poet) have contributed one, two or three
poems each. Greatly to Mr Stow’s credit,
the resulting collection reads much more
like his answer to “What sort of poetry
do you enjoy?” than an attempt to reply
to some pointless sociological enquiry
along the lines of “What sort of poetry
is being produced in Australia today?”
Whether, without help from the title,
I would have recognised these poems as
Australian I strongly doubt. Naturally,
there are allusions to Australian flora,
fauna and topography. Spinifex decorates
the red-ochre landscape which Roland
Robinson describes in a poem which
makes a rather cave-painting effect
almost as though the poem were
executed in red-ochre. Nan McDonald
invokes the unmistakeably Australian
Burragorang almost liturgically, and
almost succeeds in turning it into one
of those places like Camelot and Atlantis
whose existence is extra-geographical.
Indeed, I have no idea whether Burra-
gorang does geographically exist.
However, such evidence of Australian
subject matter is no longer conclusive
evidence of Australian workmanship.
Australian painters (one of whom is paid
in this volume the charming tribute of
Ray Mathew’s slender, tender lyric, “For
A Blackman Drawing”) have made the
Australian landscape, together with the
myths which brood over it like a climate,
universal property. Australian mythology
might today as readily inspire a foreign
poet as the Greek legend of Galatea
has inspired David Campbell to a pair
of verses which are among the most
interesting in the book, because they
employ intellectual complexity which
makes me hope their author may be
prospecting the way back to the emotion-
in-intellect method of metaphysical
poetry.
One fact about the Australian land-
scape which might not emerge from Aus-
tralian painting but, most insistently,
emerges from this book is how much of
it is suburbs. (Even so, Australian fiction
and theatre have probably already made
this plain; indeed, one poem here speaks
of “The Patrick White or Barry
Humphries country”.) From the “Sub-
urban Sonnet” by Miriam Stone to J. R.
Rowland’s telling simile “streets like un-
made beds”, the collection seems
obsessed by suburbs much more so
than, I would guess, a comparable Eng-
lish collection would. I do not believe
that Australian towns can have more
suburbs than English towns have, but I
suppose they may have less of any-
thing else.
Only Chris Wallace-Crabbe’s “Terra
Australis” propounds a theme uniquely
Australian the theme, in fact, of
universal culture’s not being quite uni-
versal; the poem transcribes the dis-
concerting sense of time-lag and space-
lag about inheriting a culture built by
“Luther and Cromwell, Socrates and
Marx” in a continent which three out
of the four of them never dreamed of.
For the rest, this seems to me simply


The one volume encyclopaedia of
all nations. The most authoritative
and up-to-date work of reference
on world affairs, it contains the
latest information about the rapidly
changing political, economic, social
and allied conditions in the world,

raphers, journalists, business men,

verse in English. About a fifth of it is a
touch mild and genteel for my taste;
but, then, in a world where people at
least believe they haven’t time to read,
all reading matter has at least to appear
condensed, and lyric poetry has had
thrust on it functions which used to be
performed by mild and discursive essays.
1 could persuade myself that the pre-
ference these poems show for strictish
metres and the high proportion of (more
or less) ballads (including one by
Charles Higham about that now
thoroughly universal myth-hero Jack the
Ripper) reflected an Australian habit of
singing folksongs in unison, but I think
they more probably reflect Mr Stow’s
poetic likings. I can detect no rhymes
which betray the Australian accent as
some of Keats’s betray his Cockney
accent though I think I detect from
one final line that its author mispro-
nounces “apostate”; it’s only by stressing
the word incorrectly that I can get five
feet out of “The neutral sun, the smiling
apostate”. The only linguistic discovery
the poems as a group suggest to ‘me is
that “whore” (I don't imply through any
prevalence in the Australian fauna) is a
more colloquial word in Australia than
in England, where, like most words not
pronounced exactly as they are spelt, it
is tending to become literary. (This last
observation is probably not true of Scot-
land, where the language of the Bible
is said to be colloquial still.)
It is of course a high compliment to
say this volume should be read as poetry
rather than Australian poetry. What the
best poems in it deserve can be bor-
rowed from one of them a poem,
short and simple as a poem by a child,
in which Charles Osborne incarnates a
childish (but woe to all adults who have
lost it) sadness about the moment when
a bird is shot. Mr Osborne has called
this “Folk Song From An Unknown
Country”. All good poetry comes from
no known, geographical place but from
the unknown (yet instantly recognisable)
country of the imagination. Ten or so
pieces in this collection could properly
bear the title “Poetry From An Un-
known Country, 1964”.

Ross Campbell. Shakespeare Head
Press. 17s. 6d.
|f the jacket did not proclaim “Paddo”
to be “one of the funniest books to
recall hard times in Australia” and if it
did not further raise one’s hopes with a
Unique Unk White vision of Sydney
backyards, one might not feel so let
down. Gratifying as it would be to
announce the appearance of a new Aus-
tralian humorist, the sad fact is that there
is barely a smile in the book.
Physically slight and with little point
or substance, “Paddo” is at least easily
digested. By page 124 it is all over and
one’s appetite—presuming, one has an
appetite for boyhood reminiscences—has
not even been whetted. A light diet is
all very well, but Arthur Staples has left
the meat out of the pot.
In twenty-one brief and loosely con-
nected anecdotes, Mr Staples (drawing,
presumably, on his own experiences) has
attempted to recapture the atmosphere
of growing up, when times were tough,
in the Sydney suburb of Paddington.
And to a limited extent he has succeeded:
the sights and sounds and people of city
life in the ’thirties are here, but so
sketchily recorded as to leave little last-
ing impression. To create an illusion of
life, this type of first-person narration,
whether it be fiction or autobiography,
requires a meticulous selection of signi-
ficant detail. Here the detail is honest
but on the whole so commonplace that
it is as if Mr Staples has struck an
average. We recognise the voice of the
boy, Mick Ryan, but he too emerges as
a type rather than an individual like his
more illustrious prototypes, Huck Finn
and Peter Grimble. In his use of the
vernacular, the author is uneasy and in-
consistent, and the stylistic intensifica-
tion which distinguishes good narrative
and dialogue is missing.
Ross Campbell writes: “I live with my
wife and four children in a suburban
home of 15 squares, including myself.”
Don’t be deceived. Mr Campbell is no
square; on the contrary, he is as “hep”
as anyone around —except perhaps his
children.
A regular contributor to the Sydney
“Sunday Telegraph” and “The Australian
Women's Weekly”, his humor is gradu-
ally creating a folk-lore of Australian
suburbia in microcosm. Not being a
Sydneyite I never see the “Telegraph”
and only get a peek at that distaff
national institution, “Women’s Weekly”,
at the dentist's, where I just have time
for the girdle ads before my name is
called. My introduction to Ross Camp-
bell was therefore, an earlier collection
of his humorous pieces intriguingly en-
titled “Daddy, Are You Married?”, the
publication of which was, as far as I
was concerned, an occasion for cheer-
ing. Here at last, was a worthy successor
to Lennie Lower. “Mummy, Who is
Your Husband?” continues the riotous
day-to-day doings at Oxalis Cottage as
well as discussing such important topics
as notes for the milkman, the packaging
of shirts, and the whereabouts of plumb-
ers in winter.
If brevity really is the soul of wit,
the insistence on short sentences and
paragraphs by the popular Press should
suit the humorist. Ross Campbell adapts
the convention to his own purposes and,
by careful choice of words, he jolts the
reader’s imagination to fill in the gaps.
In the very first piece, he writes: “They
were Norm and Haze. She was wearing
mauve matador pants, and he was in a
two-tone sports coat.” There is no need
for further description. We recognise
these two and are not surprised when
(while a guide describes the beauties of
the Harbor) Norm puts a headlock on
Haze and she bites him playfully on the
hand.
As in the previous volume, Mr Camp-
bell chiefly concerns himself with the
domestic scene, and particularly with the
children—Theodore, Lancelot, Little
Nell and, a recent addition, Baby Pip.
With a minimum of whimsy, he sets
down those out-of-mid-air things that
children do say but which few writers
are able to report without losing the
magic. When Little Nell is told by an
exasperated teenage sister to go and play
with Diana Waffle, she explicitly says:
“You like blowing me up out of every-
thing you do in the whole house.” And

Rabbit, Run
The Year of the Angry Rabbit.
Russell Braddon. Heinemann.
235. 6d.
The Livin’ is Easy. John Tranter.
Oldbourne. 20s.
TI/Ir Braddon is an Australian writer
who lives in England. Homesick-
ness may take strange forms; in his case
it has found expression in the production
of a humorous but horrendous fantasy.
“The Year of the Angry Rabbit” is the
year in which Prime Minister Kevin Fitz-
gerald, aroused from slumber one morn-
ing by a grazier mate with a hectoring
request to do something about the rabbits
that are eating up his property, sets the
scientists to work to discover something
more effective than the poisons hitherto
known.
The experts comply with a will, and
what results is “Supermix”. It does its
job rather better than expected. Not only
does it wipe out rabbits but it can kill
people, and there’s no antidote to the
virus. Overnight, Australia becomes the
possessor of a weapon to which there is
no counter, and Fitzgerald, a paladin of
the post-Ming era, emerges as World Dic-
tator. Laying down the law to the uni-
verse, he imposes his Pax Australica.
He is a realist who understands that
there has to be some outlet to bellicose
drives, so he arranges for limited wars
among the eager Powers to be waged
on a restricted battlefield in Central Aus-
tralia. When ancient combatants get
obstreperous he is not above depopula-
ting the Channel Isles or the Falklands.
But, alas, there is a flaw. A super-
brand of rabbits, as big as alsatians,
makes its appearance, and a full-scale
war, including national call-up, has to
be waged against them. By ill-luck
their infection spreads to the human
enemy, region by region the continent
has to be evacuated and, when at last
all is silence, the poor old Aborigines
come again into their own.
This, you might say, is the Australian
tall story to kill all tall stories. It is
written with professional assurance and
plenty of dash, but it is not as funny as
it might be. The protagonists—Fitz-
gerald; Alfred Hill, the grazier; the
wretched scientists and soldiers —are two-
dimensional cartoons of local archetypes,
operating in an environment whose con-
tours are drawn with a tar-brush.
“Bludgerton” is the name of Alf Hill’s
infested homestead, and the rest fits the
same pattern. All this is amusing
enough as a gusty skit on a Dad-and-
Dave civilisation, complete with its
familiar type of politics, but it could
have been more. Somewhere along the
line imagination, if never invention,
peters out.
Tucked away in the story may be a
moral, but, if so, it’s a trifle hard to
define.
It is all too simple to define in “The
Livin’ is Easy”, Mr Tranter's maiden
effort as a novelist. It sums up to the
truth that there is more in life than
making money. Richard Brandt, a
rising young American executive, is sent
by his firm to Australia to broaden his
experience. Getting on is his only creed.
Passed on to Melbourne, he meets a
decent, old-time manager, David High-
lander, whose story is told in flash-backs
to the point where he is about to get the
bullet. As was to be demonstrated,
Richard's Achilles heel is bared before
the last chapter: love cures him of the
Pierpont Morgan complex. A minor
hero, Joel Truman, hates the rat-race
from the start, and love does the right
thing for him, too.
There are hints that John Tranter
may write a better novel soon, but he
will have to learn to see people more
originally, and their conflicts from
within. He certainly will have to rid
his characters of their oral compulsions.
What they do when they smile or grin
is nobody’s business: one even “only
extends one side of his mouth” in the
(oft-repeated) process.

Jewish Migrant
Distant Land. Judah Waten. F. W,
Cheshire. 255.
Toshua Kuperschmidt is a Polish Jew
** who arrives with his newly married
wife in Australia in the 19205. But
“Distant Land” is not at all a documen-
tary of migrant life. Melbourne is there,
the names of suburbs and shops occur,
but Melbourne and the country town
Joshua settles in are scarcely evoked;
there is little attempt to suggest atmos-
phere, description is often perfunctory
and the documentary reality of place and,
brand names is there as a kind of short-
hand.
Of course it is more than just that.
One of the novel’s fine achievements is
the absorption of very real, factual de-
tails. “But when he read in the Press
that the Prime Minister had rebuked the
writer H. G. Wells for criticising Hitler,
that the English Foreign Secretary had
written a letter to “The Times” to deny
aspersions of Jewishness and to proclaim
that he was an Aryan, whatever that
might mean . . .” These are there not
just as background, nor to give a sense
of the period; they are very much the
subject of the novel. The theme is not
being an immigrant in Australia, but
being a Jew in the twentieth-century.
“For a Jewish boy, Joshua had been for-

tunate in getting admitted to the high
school.” And in his assumptions of the
limits and possibilities open to a Jew,
Judah Waten is very like James Baldwin.
Baldwin in “Another Country” writes
about the problems of Rufus, but for
Rufus the real problem and the cause of
all the others was being colored. His
possibilities for personal fulfilment and
for personal tragedy were dictated by
that fact. Similarly in “Distant Land”
Joshua, whom all his relatives in Poland,
the first line tells us, thought “quite
remarkable” is never able to achieve his
promise, because of that fact of being
a Jew.
But Baldwin's vivid, emotional, rhe-
torical, urgent prose, his range of image
and metaphor, the sweep of his writing,
are the direct opposite of Judah Waten's
limp, stilted, unemotional statement. His
style, easily absorbing newsreel details,
is one of sad acceptance.
“‘Just one tiny matter more’, he said
after a pause. ‘Kuperschmidt is a long
lame. Would it be such a blow to you
if you called yourself Cooper?’ ”
But with the sad resignation, always
there is a tension between the simple
statement and the burning feeling, a ten-
sion between what is said and what is
omitted.
The style has its limitations. Control-
led statement can lapse into bare sim-
plicity. “It seemed to Joshua that his
three children represented three worlds.”
Told this starkly, limitations in the novel
are suggested. It falls into a classic
Marxian dialectic. The thesis Joshua —
artistic, aspiring, ineffectual, concerned
with his people; his wife Shoshannah the
antithesis—businesslike, active, making a
fortune in the war, arranging her child-
ren’s marriages. They are less indi-
viduals than types. And their child-
ren represent three worlds, with Benja-
min providing the obvious synthesis. He
has his father's social concern, but ex-
tends this out into the world, marrying
a gentile. Because for the Jew in the
twentieth-century the traditional closed
society is not enough; he must make a
new alliance on a social, not a racial,
basis.
The novel is saved, though, from
schematicism by disclosure of the per-
sonal failure of Joshua’s life. He leaves
Poland with hopes, and in Australia sells
spectacles to country farmers; his wife
saves for him to go to university, but he
never does. Always he remains unful-
filled, a failure. And hopes for the
future lie not with him but with Ben-
iamin. He comes to accept the rightness
of Benjamin's decision to marry into the
gentile world and work with it —but
foshua himself is too old for this. At
(lie end Joshua is near to death; but “the
sun was just rising.” The future is
hopeful with Benjamin’s generation.

Grief, Fear and Loss
This Real Pompei. Poems by R. A.
Simpson. Jacaranda Press. 225. 6d.
"D. A. Simpson is one of the most pro-
-“-*1 minent of a recently arrived group
of Melbourne poets. The poetry of the
now ageing Sydney school tends to be
sensual, evocative and concerned with
direct and simple emotions. The younger
Melbourne group is more bland and
abstract in utterance, more self-analytical
and avoids anything that is dinkurn-
Aussie. It worries about commitment
on moral and social issues. Having a
Sydney bias myself, I am tempted to ask
whether seriousness of intention always
leads to seriousness of result?
Mr Simpson avoids much of the
Augustan 'self-consciousness of some of
his Melbourne contemporaries, such as
Evan Jones who states in one poem that
he “sings” about the man who “shapes
his chaos with a patient art”. (What
chaos?) Mr Simpson does not write this
sort of thing. He is more self-effacing.
He is haunted by grief, fear and loss of
faith. Moments of enjoyment are short-
lived. Thus “Fishing Trip on the Bay”
ends on a note of disquietude with the
line “evening emphasised that land was
far”.
One of the most satisfactory things
about this volume is the way in which
so many of the poems begin as a simple
depiction of scene or landscape and
gradually take on a spiritual significance.
This is generally done quite subtly. In
“After the Bush Fire” he writes:
Here where the fire came
Across a road toward the beach,
The trees have lost their claim
On leaves. The dead entreat.
Mountains near the sea
Are black. Although I’d now forget
Much of the past that burns in me,
The charred word is firmly set.
He is talking here, I think, about the
loss of his early belief in Catholicism.
This describes with poignancy the plight
of a man with a hunger for certainty,
whom no certainties now satisfy.
“Sleep-walker” is my favorite poem in
this collection, perhaps because it is the
most lyrical. It begins:
With childhood in your eyes,
You walk across the floor
To where the midnight lies
Beyond each open door.
The poem ends with him leading his
daughter back to bed:
A rhymester leading a face
Through regions of the dead.
Some of the poems are marred by an
excessive self-consciousness. I feel that
Simpson sometimes tries too hard to be
committed or involved. In “View from
My Garden” he asks, “How should I
act today . . . Where suburbs are peren-
nial?” In another poem he asks, “And
what would I have done?”
Some poems are also marred by the
current fashion for neutral diction. There
are too many words like “flaccid”,
“neat”, “peripheral”, “complacent”.
GEOFFREY LEHMANN
The Monster
The Life and Death of John Price.
Mr Justice John Vincent Barry.
Melbourne University Press. 50s.
I|/|r Justice Barry’s short book deals
with the life and death of the sup-
posed monster, John Price, whose fame
or notoriety rests mainly on the fact that
the allegations of cruelty against him at
Norfolk Island and his murder during
the 1857 uprising of convicts led Marcus
Clarke to use him as his prototype for
his horrible commandant Maurice Frere
in “For the Term of His Natural Life”.
This book is more an assessment or
judicial summing up than a biography.
And judges’ summings-up rest only on
whatever arid evidence is presented and
excludes deduction from facts not sworn
on oath at the hearing. And the validity
of the evidence depends often on the
nature of the witnesses. Much of the testi-
mony used against Price, both by Justice
Barry and Marcus Clarke, is that of
clergy and the hypocrisy of early Austra-
lian clergy who somehow felt themselves
aggrieved is more obvious than their
veracity in a whole ignoble roll of cases.
Richard Johnson, the first of them, paid
rum as wages but condemned the de-
bauchery it caused. The Revd Mr Fysshe
Palmer and his Scottish martyr colleagues
originated the legend of the wicked Rum
Corps after the wicked Rum Corps
officers had stopped them trading them-
selves with fiery arrack which they had
bought for a few pence and retailed at
pounds a gallon. The Revd Samuel
Marsden had an Irish convict lad flogged
from head to heel, literally till the bones
of his back were exposed, and that not
for any crime, but merely to tell “where
some pikes were hidden”. Nobody, in
fact, ever found any pikes. Yet the in-
human flogger accused the merciful and
gentle Macquarie (after he had stopped
his accuser from administering brutal
floggings), of inhumanity which produced
non-existent “graveyards like ploughed
fields”, full of apparently slaughtered
convicts.
I have no more faith in Mr Justice
Barry’s principal witness, obviously a
most erratic and eccentric character,
than I have in any of his unworthy fore-
runners in the art of traduction of
governors and commandants.
And I cannot discern in Price’s earlier
Australian life the consistency in in-
humanity with his period at Norfolk
Island and in Victoria that his assessor
professes to find proven.
The son of a Cornish baronet, a uni-
versity man, a magistrate with an urge
—which our author finds undesirable—
to learn in their normal haunts the
“kiddie” language which so many con<*
victs spoke, seems to me with his associ-
ations and his marriage into the humane
vice-regal menage of Sir John Franklin
to proclaim the “man of good parts,
with a light and easy way with him . . .
a man of courage and quick resolve”.
The system he was called on to ad-
minister at Norfolk Island was con-
ceived in a cruel age for the rigid control
and punishment of some of the worst
felons ever sent abroad from England,
so as to constitute transportation an
“object of dread”. He undoubtedly
ruled them with the cruel severity and
with all the Celtic passion of a frightened
and angry Cornishman. But Mr Justice
Barry seems not altogether just.

Exports
Australian Directory of Exports,
1964-65. Issacson. £5 ss.
EThis is Australia’s first comprehensive
A directory of exporters and export
products. It lists more than 1100 manu-j
facturers, merchants, wholesalers and
agents and gives a guide to more
than 4000 rural, mineral and manufac-
tured goods available for export. This
Directory caters particularly for overseas
buyers of Australia’s exports with a full
guide to established supply sources of
all goods and services. It also gives de-
tails on Australian conditions including
trade formalities, export and customs
procedures and regulations, exchange
and investment laws, and a full list of
Australian Government offices abroad.
This Directory will enable overseas buy-
ers to select easily those exporters who
can meet their needs. The current suc-
cess of Australia’s export drive made the
need for a directory of exports morei
pressing than ever before.
The Directory contains an alphabeti-
cal list of products available and beside
each product is a key number which
identifies a firm or firms in the alpha-
betical list of exporters wishing to export
the product. The list of exporters con-
tains details of each company’s structure,
lists its key executives, overseas agencies
and a list of products. The Directory
contains also a list of service industries,
such as advertising agents, banks, export
agents and airlines, and an index of
brand names.
There is also a general introduction
giving a brief guide to Australian politics,
economics, marketing practices, export
formalities and geography.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Ripples from the Auto Strike
Strikes in the automobile industry in Australia do not
& have such an obvious impact on the share market
because General Motors-Holaen’s shares are not listed on
the Stock Exchange. Nevertheless, it is worth drawing
some parallel with the strike at General Motors’ plants
in the US, which immediately sliced a couple of dollars
from General Motors’ recent peak market price of 10 li
dollars.
General Motors supplies more than half the cars made
in America and a strike against GM can ripple all the way
back through components makers to the suppliers of basic
materials like steel, paint, etc. The loss of purchasing
power of employees right down the line is fantastic.
Similarly, any sharp gain in wages can create a yardstick
which other unions can use as a weapon in their bargaining
with management.
General Motors-Holden’s dominates the automotive in-
dustry in Australia. Although it holds a smaller share of
the market than it does in the US, it still gets fairly close
to controlling a third of the market.
Because of GM-H’s high profitability in Australia, the
unions believe the company can well afford a £3 a week
increase in wages. As employees also have contributed
to GM-H’s profitability, they doubtless feel that direct
bargaining between management and labor, on the US
pattern, is fully justified and bears no relationship to the
rest of the automotive industry or other industries.
Unfortunately, this is not so. Both in the US and in
Australia, the gains of such a large body of workers auto-
matically would set a pattern for similar wage demands
elsewhere which, if granted, could not be absorbed and
would only lead to general price rises.
The inference, not always readily understood by the
public, is that the automotive industry here has become a
major economic factor affecting many ancillary industries,
including hire-purchase, tyres, petrol, motels, roads, and
so many inter-related activities.
Today, whether we like it or not, the prosperity of the
motor industry rubs off on to everyone, not forgetting the
tremendous revenue it supplies in the form of direct and
indirect taxes. GM-H shares cannot reflect the situation
in the market, but there should be many others who would
be affected if the strike at GM-H plants is prolonged.
Competitors may gain temporary sales at GM-H’s
expense, as they have done in the USA, but they still must
face up to the problem of higher wage structures once
the GM-H strike is settled.
Scurrying for Credit
A Sydney bank manager last week said he had never
had such a clear directive from head office than the
latest instructions to refrain from new lending on cars,
land and share investment, or other “non - essential”
borrowing. Indeed, with existing overdrafts being ’super-
vised carefully (and offenders told to get down below their
overdraft limits), the credit situation must become very
much tighter within banking circles.
The seasonal call-up of trading bank deposits into
Statutory Reserve Deposits will continue. The general
impression among businessmen is that if you are not set
now, you will have great trouble in obtaining credit between
here and Christmas.
Finance houses say they have had numerous loan
requests from new clients but, in this tighter situation,
they must give priority to old clients who rely on them
as a regular source. The impression is that the finance
houses, after raising their public borrowing rates, are also
following a higher interest rate structure in their lending,
thus conforming to the general trend of dearer money.
The flexible interest rate weapon, being wielded with
more expertise by the Reserve Bank, is being felt more
keenly throughout industry. Of course it has been very
strongly reinforced this time by the influence of higher
taxes, labor shortages, increased competition from imports,
and the need to employ larger working capital today than
a year or two ago.
Bright Shade of Lipstick
An English accountant, Mr L. J. Matchan, whose com-
pany makes contraceptives and is not unduly worried
about competition from the “pill”, hit Sydney last week
and predicted that his Australian offshoot, Cope Allman
(Australia) Ltd, would make £300,000 net profit on a
paid-up capital of £140,000 this year.
Activities of the local Cope Allman group are mainly
in the manufacture of lipstick containers, (holding 85 p.c.
of the market), injection moulded plastic products, custom
jewellery, cosmetic packs, plastic containers, etc. But no
contraceptives.
To get Mr Matchan in perspective, it is necessary to
know that he has been very active in the cosmetics field
for many years (as an employee of Max Factor and
Revlon), and his company has been very successful in
virtually cornering the market in lipstick containers. So
much so that he claims the Cope Allman group controls

100 p.c. of the market in France and South Africa, 90 p.c.
in the UK and (through Popolare Metal Stamping Co.
Pty Ltd), 85 p.c. of the local market in Australia.
To enter Australia on a public company basis, the
Cope Allman group paid Bs. 6d. cash for the 2s. 6d.
ordinary shares of PPW Holdings Ltd in August this year.
Into this “shell” the group is pumping the expertise it has
acquired in making lipstick containers. Capital, naturally,
is dominated by the UK group and the prospect of things
to come evidently was translated quickly into the 2s 6d.
par value shares, which have jumped to around eight times
par value at around 20s.
It doesn’t end there. The Australian company controls
71J p.c. of the Cope Allman company in South Africa
(which is reputed to be doing well) and will also be
responsible for a new company being formed in India.
It took many years for Cope Allman to get the knack
of making acceptable lipstick containers on a mass produc-
tion scale and at a favorable
price. Therefore, this very pro-
fitable section of the business
provides a good profit margin
and defies competitors.
With more lipstick users
coming of age every day Cope
Allman seems to have a nice
little market to itself, without
counting the other products it
manufactures, some of which
(like adhesives) may be added
to the local range at a later
date. It also is the third largest
maker of aerosol valves in the
world.
Capital will probably remain
tight, with big wads of shares
held by the UK group. Also,
on UK experience, the group is
bonus prone and likes to ex-
pand by takeover (it has 50
subsidiaries in the UK).
Key operating company in
Australia is Popolare Metal
Stamping Co. Pty Ltd, which
was taken over in 1963

and is now merged into the PPW Holdings shell. Import-
ant profits will accrue to the Australian company from
the controlling interest in Cope Allman South Africa Ltd,
which has 30 subsidiary companies and is quoted on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange.
So, even without contraceptives, Mr Matchan’s group
has given notice it is going to make a big splash, profit-wise,
on the Australian market.
Sick BOP, UK Style
Oackground music to the election battle in Britain
included the very discordant note which screeched
that Britain’s balance of payments had worsened and
probably would reach a record £stgsoo million for the year.
A drop in invisible earnings, a large outflow of long-
term capital, added to the more obvious visible trade
deficit, prompted speculation that the incoming Govern-
ment would need to introduce import controls.
This alone prompted an increase in import orders as
a precautionary move by importers who decided to
anticipate possible restrictions.
Some financial experts suggest that Britain should
borrow money to tide her over her balance of payments
problem and so offset the adverse effect of stockpiling bji
importers. Such a situation underlines the urgency of nev|
trade outlets and explains in no mean terms the hard-sell
of the British Exhibition recently held in Sydney.
Sales to the Common Market have declined. Britain
sadly needs to boost her exports to other areas to offset I
this trend. The motor trade is still achieving good sales'
and exports to the USA have improved. But new and exist-
ing markets must be expanded quickly to offset the sick
balance of payments figures.
Doubts on “Compo”
is not well with workers’ compensation and the com-
plaints don’t only come from the insurance companies,
whose experience with claims has proved so profitless. The!
lawyers and industry are also
joining in. J
Much of the legal attitude!
was summed up with great*
clarity by the Chief Justice of
NSW, Mr Justice L. J. Herron,
in his Alfred Rainbow mem-
orial oration. The idea that
needs to be implemented, he
said, is that industry, which
profits from human labor, must
pay for its human losses.
Yet some scheme of comp-
rehensive social insurance
could well replace the prevail-!
ing methods of
for industrial accidents. At the (
very least, Mr Justice Herron
argued for uniform laws
throughout Australia, hazard-
ing the view that “the social
service power of the Common-
wealth is wide enough to sup-
port a general workers’ com J
pensation law”.
The late Judge Rainbow ap-
parently believed that a system
of compulsory insurance provides an unnecessarily large
amount of litigation and that the Legislature has failed to
stimulate the adoption of effective safety measures in
industry.
He maintained, too, that the system of adjudication of:
claims by courts is expensive and inefficient —posing as anl
alternative administrative tribunals. Some lawyers are
beginning to assert that the determination of claims by
courts has far from led to a clear, certain and just body
of case law.
Workers’ compensation premiums for the whole of Aus-
tralia last year totalled £43.7 million. That was part of thei
direct cost of what the Metal Trades Employers’ Association
calls the “hidden giant” of Australia’s cost structure.
The direct burden of industrial accidents hits employers
through premium charges (which have just been increased),
common law liability and a host of safety items. Indirect
costs may actually be a good deal higher, through damaged
equipment, replacement of employees and production
losses.
More than 250,000 NSW workers have been injured at|
work in each of the last three years. Both insurance and!
safety precautions need considerable reappraisal.


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
The ACTU and Wages Policy
Strikes, over-award payments and labor turnover
At a time when it could have been
thought the ACTU would be more
concerned with the position of low wage
earners, whose recent £1 increase in
wages is being eroded by higher prices
and taxation, we find Mr Monk and his
men coming in behind the GM-H strike
to get a flat increase of £3 a week in
wages of workers including those already
in the higher flights of earnings. This
is a mockery of the avowed principles on
which the unions approach the Arbitra-
tion Commission. It underlines this
column’s view that the main arbiter of
wages in this country is not the Commis-
sion but the open market.
This view was recently supported by
J. E. Isaac, Professor of Economics at
the University of Melbourne, in “The
Australian Financial Review”. “Over-
award payments have become an import-
ant part of wages,” stated Issac; they
“provide the momentum for the general
level of wages in the absence of award
adjustments.” It is possible to go fur-
ther than this. ACTU support for the
GM-H strike is a full demonstration that,
in conditions of over-full employment as
at present, the absence of award adjust-
ments has little to do with pressure for
high over-award payments. More, the
pressure for higher over-award payments
is on all the time and now, thinking itself
to have employers at its mercy in the
tight labor market, the ACTU has lost
sight of the little wage earner in its
obsession with thumping for the big ones.
In fact, Isaac hints at this. Looking
a little ahead he thinks it is a safe bet
that “even if award wages are held
(steady) for the next year or two, aver-
age earnings will keep on rising and
taking up most, if not all, the appropriate
increase in productivity”. It is highly
unlikely award wages will remain steady
over the next two years (Hawke v.
Robinson will be on again next February
for sure) and in the likely event of fur-
ther increases in award wages, pressure
for higher over-award payments will be
on all the time, willy-nilly.
In any event, the crucial point, as
Isaac puts it, is that “if wage restraint is
required anywhere, it is not merely in
the Arbitration Commission, but more
importantly, in the market”. And in
Stying this Isaac does not exonerate em-
ployers for their part in facilitating
w ages increases in the open market. As
he says, “the big problem in these times
°f full employment is not only the pres-
sure for over-award payments but the
apparent willingness of employers in
many areas of industry to pay them”.
This can certainly be said without preju-
dice to present instances where employ-
ers are putting up resistance against
claims for higher over-award payments.
Even the Victorian Chamber of Manu-
factures (in its latest bulletin) doesn’t put
the whole blame on employees and the
unions for increasing wages costs by the
over-award payments route. The
ALBERT MONK
Chamber speaks of “labor auctions”
among employers, a labor enticement
process in which soliciting by advertise-
ment and other means, offering skilled
tradesmen “highly disproportionate”
wages, boomerangs. What actually
happens is that competition for labor
forces other companies to offer equiva-
lent or higher enticements, which in
turn lift labor costs and accelerates labor
turnover over wide areas of industry; so
that, as the Chamber puts it, “the com-
pany starting the sequence can find itself
paying higher wages without having
made a gain in the number of skilled
workers it employs”.
This phenomenon of high labor turn-
over is, of course, just as big a feature of
periods of full employment in Australia
and elsewhere as rises in over-award pay-
ments. The Tariff Board stated in its
1960-61 report that comparative figures
for Australia and Britain suggest “pro-
duction costs in Australia may be more
adversely affected by labor mobility
than are production costs in Britain”.
Statistics of labor turnover in Austra-
lia are not very up-to-date. Those issued
last week relate only to the month of
March this year, when separations
where employees left jobs on their own
initiative for the month were 4.7 p.c. of
the average number of employees com-
pared with 3.5 p.c. in March, 1963.
The two industries whose labor turn-
over increased more than the average
were engineering, including extracting,
refining, engineering, metal working and
electrical equipment (up from 3.5 to
4.7 p.c. of average employees) and food,
drink and tobacco (from 3.5 to 5 p.c.).
In vehicles, including manufacture, re-
pair and assembly of motors, ships and
aircraft, labor turnover rose from 3.7 to
4.6 p.c.; in textiles and clothing from
3.1 to 3.5 p.c.; paper and printing from
2.2 to 3 p.c.; and in chemicals and oil
refining from 3.1 to 3.6 p.c. While turn-
over in non-manufacturing rose by
slightly less than in manufacturing in-
dustry, that is from 3.6 to 4.7 p.c., its
overall percentage was 0.1 p.c. higher.
To get a comparison with a previous
period of full employment it is revealing
that for March, 1960, when the previous
boom was developing strongly, voluntary
separations from employment averaged
over all industries was only 4.2 p.c. of
average employed workers during the
month compared with 4.7 p.c. in March
this year. The latter looks to be the
highest so far recorded by the Statisti-
cian, though it must be pointed out that
in most years he has confined his com-
pilation of figures for labor to only one
month in the year.
For manufacturing industry in March,
1960, the voluntary separation rate was
4.2 compared with the present 4.7 p.c.
and for non-manufacturing industry 4.1
against the present 4.7 p.c. Comparing
industries, engineering was the same 4.7
for both months, but in all other indus-
tries except clothing and textiles (down
0.3 p.c.), it was higher in March this
year than four years earlier. Apropos
the GM-H strike, most significantly
vehicles showed a rise from 4 to 4.6 p.c.
between the two months.
Going on these comparisons it might
be inferred that the industrial pot is
nearer the boil now than it was in March,
1960 (opinions differ when that boom
reached its zenith, but it might not be
too far from the mark to say, September,
1960, when the stock exchange took its
first big knock; others—but not myself—


may prefer November, 1960, when the
authorities finally woke up to the
dangers).
As for the other phenomenon, over-
award payments, there is no ready means
of assessing if these have increased more
this year than they did in 1960. Per-
haps a rough guide can be obtained from
the movement of the margin between the
basic wage and average weekly earnings
in the two years. In 1960 the biggest
quarterly increase in the gap was in the
March quarter, when the seasonally ad-
justed index of average weekly earnings
(all industries) increased by 5 points to
137.5 (1953-54=100) while the basic
wage was unchanged.
The biggest recent increase in this in-
dex in any quarter was 3.2 p.c. in the
March quarter this year (when the basic
wage was unchanged). In the following
quarter (June) this index rose by only
0.4 p.c. (the £1 increase in the basic wage
was not reflected in this). It remains to
be seen whether for this cycle the gap
between award and over-award payments
reached its peak in the March quarter;
it is impossible to predict the effect of
present strike pressures on it.
This is also the case with industrial
disputes, which are a rule of thumb
index of such pressures. Counting in
those indirectly involved, the number—
-603,279—0f workers affected by indus-
trial disputes in 1960 was the highest
since the war and compared with only
237,471 in 1959. Up to June (two
quarters) this year the number was
288,003, or just below the 1960 rate.
With the current strikes at General
Motors-Holden’s and of transport work-
ers in Sydney and Newcastle, not to
speak of the recent tram workers’ strike
in Melbourne and the industrial dispute
at Mt Isa, the 1960 figure should be sur-
passed before the year is out.
“CROESUS”
Purifying the Stockbroker?
Fingers in a variety of pies
an Australian business audience it
might sound academic to suggest
that stockbroking here should be purified,
that stockbrokers be made by law to con-
fine their commercial activities strictly to
the performance of the broking function,
give their ancillary business functions
away and become brokers pure and
simple.
Academic or not, public and brokers
alike have been alerted to the suggestion
often enough as criticism has been made
of the incongruity of stockbrokers, in
their role of chairmen of listed com-
panies, addressing shareholders on share
market prospects, and others having to
explain their innocence of reasons for
contrary price movements in the shares
of companies of which they are directors.
The stock answer of brokers with
fingers in a variety of financial pies out-
side their broking firms is that they are
men of integrity, who can be expected
never to take pecuniary advantage of
privileged information in their possession.
This, however, completely begs the main
issue. Mr Baron Snider MLC amply illus-
trated this recently in the Victorian
Parliament in questioning how stock-
broker-directors cut themselves in half,
shutting out of their minds the know-
ledge they acquire about companies as
directors when to the best of their ability
and with the best intentions of imparti-
ality they are advising clients on the
merits of a company’s shares.
Even if stock exchange members are
in my experience invariably men of in-
tegrity, consideration has also to be
given to the staffs serving them. Anybody
with an inside into the workings of a
broker’s office will know that, careful
SIR lAN POTTER
though principals may be in cloaking in-
side information from the staff, it is
virtually impossible to keep the cat in
the bag all the time. There are too many
chances it will get up to the hot tin
roof. In some guise or other it is more
often than not on the cards that dealings
in the market will be inspired by it ahead
of the general public. The bone is
being pointed at anybody in saying thi
only stating what is fairly obvious. Stoch
brokers’ staffs don’t have to take tf
pledge. Ideally, then, brokers, like tf
general public, should not have access j'.
privileged information.
Opinions differ on whether broke
directorships provide the main scope f (
abuse. This depends a good deal on tt.
degree of intimacy between the compat
and the broking firms. Usually broket
are taken on to company board
mainly for their ability to open doors t
channels of finance, including undet
writing as well as capital raising. Theii
genera] expertise in finance is thrown 1
in for good measure. They thus have ac
cess to the fullest information about i
company, particularly when their under
writing of an issue is involved. Perhapi
it's harder to get much closer to the fact!
about a company at the particular time c;
an issue.
On a term basis, however, the closest
tie-ups would be those between broken
and their own financial offshoots. There
are any number of such relationships,!
most of them being between the biggest
brokers in Melbourne and Sydney and
finance and investment companies, ii> N
eluding short-term money market, under
writing, commercial discounting, factor]
ing and so on. \
Admittedly the number of listed com-
panies in this area is fairly small and thi
markets in their shares are not habitual!
sensitive. This is not to say that the]
don’t have spasms for instance, thi'
slide in the shares of Australian Unites,
Corporation, the holding company oft
complex of lan Potter and Co.’s financi
offshoots, after the debacle in Australian
Factors in which it had a big interest]
and Second Century Corporation, a
finance (mainly factoring) creation ol
Wm Noall and Son, whose shares tumb
led recently ahead of the disclosure o|
a loss by the company. Both these listed
companies involve broker-directorships
A straight-out debarment of broker*
from being directors of their finance ofi
shoots is not the answer. The reason t
that the operations (and probably thf_
success) of most of these offshoots de
pend to a large extent on their dost
gearing with the stockbroking firms con
cerned. Nearly all of them owe theii)
origin to the inspiration of the principal!
of their stockbroking associates. The)
have grown to impressive stature in
cases largely as a result of that associa-
tion. Even their day-to-day working usu-
ally involves a close tie-up. It is not s(
much a matter of legal form as ensuring
a modus vivendi. Personalities come intc
it strongly.
The brokers behind most of thes4
finance offshoots are rare birds of thi
likes of Sir lan Potter and' Mr Staniforf

NDS.NB
Ricketson. You simply can’t just pull
finance eagles of this type out of the air.
Maybe they can now give away more
money than the big figures they make,
yet we owe a debt to them for the
development of sophisticated finance
facilities here which now rivals those in
the financial centres overseas and without
which the country would be a lot poorer.
To cut them off from directing their fin-
ance offshoots, particularly their money
market and underwriting companies,
would be cutting off our noses. In any
case, to debar stockbrokers from their
boards would not necessarily close the
channels of information to them.
Whether as directors or merely as associ-
ates they would be bound to be intimately
conversant with the activities of such
companies.
If something needs to be done to purify
stockbroking in this direction a possible
solution could be to eliminate public
participation even indirectly through
listed holding companies in the finance
offshoots of broking firms. A good many
of them, in fact a majority of the short-
term money market companies, already
conform to this. But a large number
. don’t.
It will be said, of course, that such
a step would not eliminate the main
avenue through which brokers acquire
intimate information about companies,
that is through underwriting. This raises
the question whether brokers should be
debarred from underwriting and a further
one, who would take their place? This
brings us up against the hard fact that in
present circumstances there is no fully-
grown alternative, such as there is in
London, say, where underwriting is the
preserve of the merchant banks and
similar investment finance houses.
In recent years a good start has been
made in the development of merchant
banks here with, say, the Development
Finance Corporation in Sydney as the
leader of the independents. Some in-
dependents like Anglo-Australian have
already thrown in their lot with big
broker-sponsored brothers, like Austra-
lian United Corporation. Indeed, the
trend in underwriting looks to be towards
closer links with brokers’ offshoots and
thus with brokers, rather than the other
way round. This throws us back to what
Mr. C. T. Looker, a broker-director of
Australian United Corporation, told The
Bulletin last week, reliance on the in-
tegrity of brokers even if this does not
quite resolve Mr Snider’s problem of
how a broker-director cuts himself in
half.
Royalty Links
CHEMICAL HOLDINGS LTD
is arranging greater activity in local
markets by negotiating with several US
industrial groups for further royalty
agreements.
Chairman Mr A. C. Hatrick, dis-
closing this in the company’s annual
report, says the agreements will cover
the manufacture of additional products
both in the chemical and engineering
fields. Earlier this month ACH an-
nounced it had completed a manufac-
turing and distributing agreement with
a division of the Textron group of the
US to produce and market a wide range
of industrial and building fasteners.
In the report, Mr Hatrick says Reich-
hold Chemicals Inc. (Aust.) Pty increased
turnover and operated profitably, des-
pite very competitive conditions through-
out the chemical industry. Another sub-
sidiary, Die Casters Pty, introduced a
more selective policy regarding new
products, to maintain an “acceptable”
level of earnings.


Fire Insurance Headaches
Part of a world-wide pattern
Fires, which in 1963 caused £3O
million damage in Australia, are
becoming an increasingly large
headache for insurance companies. Last
year’s figure was £lO million higher
than the previous year and represented
a far higher loss per head of population
than in Great Britain, where fires cost
£3B million for a population nearly five
times our size.
Although the proportion of claims to
premiums has not reached the ridiculous
stage it has in motor vehicle insurance
(see last week’s Bulletin, pages 62 and
63), insurance companies say the
business is becoming less profitable each
year as claims eat out a larger and larger
part of income.
In 1958-59, premium income was
£30,642,000 and claims outgoings
£9,370,000, or roughly a third. The
latest figures available are for 1962-
63. In that year premiums totalled
£36,923,000, while claims reached
£13,203,000, more than a third of the
income.
This, say insurance companies, in-
dicates a trend towards more costly
fires and greater frequency. Although
they would not say definitely that
premiums could rise, the impression was
given that there could be an upward
adjustment of the basic rate which has
stood for many years. The rate is
applied to the value of the building or
contents. As the value increases, so the
premiums become more expensive.
One of the reasons for the big fire
losses last year was the Townsville sugar
terminal blaze, which has been estimated
to cost in the region of £6 million,
The Australian Fire Protection As-
sociation, a non-profit organisation which
has as its aims dissemination of informa-
tion on fire protection devices and
education of the public on fire protection,
says the rising cost of fires in Australia
i s part of a world-wide pattern,
“There is clearly a need for a greater,
continued understanding of the fire
problem and for the education of every
section of the community in the import-
ance of the individual’s part in mini-
mising fire losses.” The Association’s
rep ort reveals there was one fire every
seven minutes in Australia last year,
Damage totalled just under £600,000 a
week.
A serious feature was the number of
fires j n buildings housing large numbers
Q f people. There were fires in 3500
houses and flats, 40 hotels, 28 hostels
and 37 schools. Pleasure craft were
burnt out at the rate of at least one a
week.
Fire protection devices which, when
installed, can give the insured up to 50
p, c . discount on premiums, operated at
a high degree of efficiency. Automatic
sprinkler systems, successful in control-
ling 2 30 fires last year, were 99.67 p.c.
effective. Automatic alarm systems were
}QO p c effective
The causes of these fires, says an
American expert, are three: “Men,
women and children » True , because the
basic cause of a fire must always relate
to the human factor. Smoking in bed,
burning fat, a dropped match or a
cigarette, kerosene heaters, solvents used
too close to naked flames all these i
causes and more involve at least on/
person.
When determining premiums, insur- (
ance companies closely study the firj
risk involved. Country insurance is
usually higher than in the city because
of unreliable or non-existent water,
supplies and the distance of a fire
brigade. All insurance risks are assessed
on the construction of the building, the
resistance to fire of materials used, the l
presence of fire - fighting equipment
(usually applicable to industrial build-
ings) and the purpose for which the
building is used. Dwellings, of course,'
pay lower premiums than, say, service
stations, where the fire risk is greater
because of the presence of highly in-
flammable materials.
Fire insurance is a big gamble for
both the insurance companies and the
individuals. One big fire could wipe out f
30 years’ profit. The individual’s gamble
is on how much to insure, or whether to
insure at all. An insurance assessor told
The Bulletin there was an alarming
amount of under-insurance. “House-
holders will insure either the building
or the contents, thinking that the one
policy covers all risks. This is due to
ignorance on their own part and very;
often it is the fault of the insurance!
salesman who neglects to point out the
limited cover. In industrial fire in-
surance there is a similar situation. The
only way to get complete coverage in
industry is to insure fully.
“If the businessman does not buy
complete cover he may be subject to
average if there is a fire. This means
that if he has a building worth £lOO,OOO
and he insures it for only £50,000, if
there is a fire which causes £ 10,000\
damage he is likely to be paid only 1
£5OOO. Here again ignorance and neglect
often cause under-insurance. Under-
insurance can also be caused by not
taking into account appreciation of the
building’s value.”
The assessor estimated that 30 p.c. of
all people buying fire insurance fail to“
cover themselves fully.
Although fire insurance companies, in
days gone by, owned and operated theit
own fire brigades they, today, are
highly resentful of the fact that they
have to support the Government-riu\
fire brigades. Throughout Australia they'
pay between 70 and 75 p.c. of the cost
of running fire brigades out of their
premium income. In NSW last year 236
insurance companies and 43 self-insurers
(mainly large companies) contributed an
average of 17.53 p.c. of their premium
income, or £2,679,577, to pay 75 p.c.
of the fire brigades’ costs. I

The Government and municipalities
and shires contributed £446.596 each to
bring the NSW Fire Brigades’ revenue
from contributions up to £3,572,769.
In 1962 insurance companies and
owners paid £2,717,819 (or 18.41 p.c.
of their premium income) while Govern-
ment and local government contributed
£453,036 each to make total contribu-
tions £3,623,891.
This charge on the companies, said
one director, is “iniquitous. Australia
is the only country in the world where
it is made. We feel it is unjustified, as
the fire brigade is available to every-
one, whether or not they have insured
their property. It would be more equit-
able if the Government paid the total
cost of running it and taxed people
according to the rateable value of their
property.”
Another insurance company took the
issue a step further. “Since instructions
to firemen are to save life first and
property afterwards, why not levy a
charge on the life insurance companies?
To me it seems only fair that the Clj
of running a fire brigade should be L
insurance spread the cost among j
many people as possible.”
TMe increase in fire claims, said
spokesman for one large con'pany,
partly due to the public’s greater awar,
ness of just what a fire policy can 4
“They may not take care to cover ever]
thing, but when there is a fire you cs
bet they’ll claim everything they <4
under the policy they have bought. Tty
has led, to a certain extent, to a largt
number of deliberate claims. Althoiij
there is no conceivable way of extract
ing figures on this, and in many casi
bogus claims cannot be proved, I
sure that many more people nowadai
are depending on insurance to replaf
things. And it’s so easy to drop \
cigarette on a lounge. Even if negligence
is the cause the policyholder is stij
entitled to payment.” j >
Fires in industry, one company feety
are becoming more commonplace dur
to automation and mechanisation. Whet
the human element is not so necessarj
fires are not noticed as quickly an(
before an automatic alarm or sprinkle;,
can go off quite a bit of damage ma. v
be done. More vigilance and faster
responding protection systems wou.
help cut down the incidence of the
fires.
Mr N. C. Strother Smith, director t
the UK Fire Protection Associatio;
points out that more industrial fires staf
when premises are unoccupied tk
occupied. “For every two fires costing
more than £lO,OOO between the hows
of 6 a.m. and 6 p.m., three break oil
in the 12-hour night period.” He sat
education of employees into just whl
can cause fires and possibly a blank!
ban on smoking would be a wise move
He slates industrial premises with
protection systems (sprinklers, fire R
sistant doors, fire alarms) where tlf
systems are not maintained or eve
ignored. “There is, for example, liti
value in fire resisting doors if they’i
propped open for convenience durin
the day and left open at night ... 1“
modern, open-plan factories, some for
of compartmentation to restrict f
spread, and roof venting to disper
smoke and heat, certainly have a vifc
part to play.
“In all these cases, however, guidart
is available from experts once the initt'
decision has been taken. The f®
brigades and the insurance companii
are also at hand to give general advic
and management should take the oppo l
tunity their experience offers.” He adc
that fire protection is the duty 1
management. “It should supervise
prevention and set the pace in educatitfj
employees more widely.”

HIGHLIGHTS OF
WESTERN MINING CORPORATION LIMITED
ANNUAL MEETING
CHAIRMAN REVIEWS COMPANY’S MANY ACTIVITIES. At the annual meeting
of shareholders of Western Mining Corporation Limited which was held in Melbourne
on Wednesday, September 30, shareholders adopted the Annual Report and Accounts,
re-elected retiring Directors, and later unanimously passed a resolution offering a
limited number of shares to executives and senior staff of the company at 15/- per
share, the same price as those being offered to shareholders under the new issue
of shares.
The Chairman, Mr. W. D. Brookes, in his review of the company’s many activities,
covered the following points.
FINANCIAL RESULTS
Income for the year was £78,000 higher
than in 1962/63.
Dividends paid during the financial year
were unchanged at the rate of 1/- per
fully paid share. A further dividend of
6d. per share, the first for which 1961
New Issue shares qualified, had been paid
since the end of the year.
The Directors had revalued some of the
Corporation’s investments. A holding of
3,402,778 fully paid £1 shares in Alcoa of
Australia Pty. Ltd., previously carried in
books at cost, had been revalued at par,
resulting in the creation of a new Invest-
ments & Investigations Reserve of nearly
£3 million.
WMC’s interests in Great Western Con-
solidated N.L. were not written down
pending further realisation of Great
Western’s remaining assets. When estab-
lished, the loss sustained by the Corpora-
tion on these interests will be written off
against this Investments & Investigations
Reserve.
Western Mining Corporation’s sharehold-
ings in Central Norseman and Gold Mines
of Kalgoorlie had not been revalued in
any way. The book value of these invest-
ments is £1,241,000 compared with the
present market value of £3,868,000.
Profits previously set aside to Investments
& Investigations Reserve were transferred
back to Profit and Loss Appropriation
Account with the result that that account
at the close of the year contained almost
£1,100,000 of tax-free profits. When
income accrues from either Alcoa or Iron
Ore operations that amount could be used
to pay dividends exempt from Australian
income tax in the hands of shareholders.
GOLD MINING
Great Western Consolidated N.L. ceased
operations during the year, and in conse-
quence the Group’s gold production
decreased about 17% to 247,363 fine
ounces from 851,063 tons of ore.
The closing down of Great Western Con-
solidated was further evidence of the
economic squeeze on the gold mining
industry, brought about by the fixed dollar
price of gold (a price last set 30 years
ago) against steadily increasing costs. It
was pleasing to see that the Common-
wealth Government realised these diffi-
culties and the Treasurer had recently
stressed the logic of an increase in the
price of gold to the International Mone-
tary Fund meeting held in Tokyo.
Until a substantially higher price for gold
was established it was imperative for the
Commonwealth Government to continue
to assist the Australian gold mining
industry. Consideration should be given
by the Commonwealth to some appro-
priate increase in this assistance to offset
recent increased cost levels.
Central Norseman Gold Corporation N.L.
Development of footage in ore was 11.5
dwt./ton over 55 inches. Since the end of
the year to 11th August, 1964, 26% of
development on shears was in ore averag-
ing 16.0 dwt./ton over 61 inches.
Ore reserves increased from 610,000 tons
averaging 10.0 dwt. per ton to 670,000
tons averaging 10.0 dwt. per ton.
Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie (Aust.) Ltd.
The expansion programme was now com-
plete with the exception of the consolida-
tion of the crusher plants, which had been
deferred. Commencement of production at
the Mt. Charlotte mine was delayed, full
production not being reached until recently.
Ore reserves at 31st March, 1964, were
982,000 tons of refractory ore at Fimis-
ton, averaging 5.7 dwt./ton and 3,830,000
tons of free milling ore at Mt. Charlotte
and Fimiston, averaging 3.4 dwt./ton.
GOLD PROSPECTING
Kalgoorlie Southern Gold Mines N.L.
Field work during the year was limited
to preparations for a geophysical survey.
A programme for further drilling had now
been formulated and proposals for financ-
ing this drilling were being considered.
Western Australia
Investigation by geological, geophysical
and geochemical methods of ore potential
in the region surrounding Kalgoorlie and
in the Leonora district is in progress and
it is expected that this activity will be
continued for some time.
Victoria
Geophysical prospecting at Stawell dis-
closed several anomalies and some of
these were drilled during the year. Min-
eralised lodes of the Mundic type and
narrow quartz reefs were intersected, gold
values being low. Latest drilling had indi-
cated the existence of a parallel anticline
to the east of the old field, in which the
rock types were similar to those in the
worked out area of the field.
IRON ORE
The first contract for the supply of Aus-
tralian iron ore to the consortium of ten
Japanese Steel Mills was signed by our
Managing Director, Mr. W. M. Morgan,
in Tokyo in December last year.
WMC are 50% partners in the first con-
tract from Koolanooka Hills area with
The Hanna Mining Company, one of
U.S.A.’s largest producers of iron ore,
and Homestake Mining Company, a large
gold mining company in the U.S.A. with
many mining interests.
WMC had negotiated a further agreement
whereby the three companies entered into
an iron ore exploration and development
partnership covering the whole of Aus-
tralia, including the Corporation’s reserves
in the Yilgarn district of Western Australia.
WMC’s voting rights in the partnership
remained at 50%, although its percentage
of interest was 37%,
WMC now had the advantage of being
relieved of expenditure on iron ore
exploration for some time, and would
manage the exploration and development
activities and any iron ore ventures which
eventuated.
ALUMINIUM
Alcoa of Australia Pty. Limited continued
its construction programme during the
year. The alumina refinery at Kwinana,
W.A., began production in November,
1963, and the capacity of the Point Henry
smelter was increased to 40,000 tons per
year by the end of 1963. The extrusion
plant of the fabrication section at Point
Henry commenced operations in the fourth
quarter of 1963. Large rolling mills and
associated equipment were now being
installed to reduce aluminium ingots to
sheet, plate and foil.
The power station and auxiliary facilities
at Anglesea, Victoria, were now being
designed for 150 megawatt capacity instead
of the initially planned 100 megawatts.
The increase in capacity would provide for
future expansion of Pt. Henry smelter.
Shipments of Kwinana alumina to Japan
commenced during the year under a long
term contract with Mitsubishi Chemical
Industries, a leading Japanese company
operating a new aluminium smelter on
the West coast of Japan, and exports of
aluminium metal from Point Henry have
been made already to Asian and European
customers.
A vigorous marketing team was active
on the local scene and overseas, and WMC
looked with confidence to the future of
Alcoa of Australia.
COPPER
Geophysical anomalies located while pros-
pecting for copper in the Moonta-Wallaroo
area of South Australia are followed up
by geochemical testing.
Exploration for copper in the Moonta-
Wallaroo area of South Australia con-
tinued in partnership with Broken Hill
South Limited and North Broken Hill
Limited. Besides continued geophysical
and geochemical surveying, several dia-
mond drill holes have been drilled to test
anomalies located. On the eastern end of
a long anomaly south of Kadina one of
the holes intersected 27' 6" of lode
material, averaging 1.2% copper, at a
vertical depth of about 750' below the
surface. A deflected hole from the same
parent hole intersected 26' 0" of lode
material averaging 1.8% copper.
TALC
Sales of talc by Three Springs Talc Pty.
Ltd. were higher than in the previous year.
LOAN FROM U.S.A.
In conclusion the Chairman said that a
loan of U. 5.52,350,000 (equivalent to
A£ 1,050,000) had been negotiated on
satisfactory terms from the Chase Man-
hattan Bank U.S.A., with the approval
of the Reserve Bank of Australia.

MARKET POINTERS
Whence the Institutions?
Their absence and a market drift
A lthough brokers’ circulars have
been hammering out a wide list of
buying suggestions, the share market
seems to be defying these exhortations.
Certainly there are better buying
opportunities today than there were
some weeks ago. But it seems that many
of the institutions are holding off during
this period of tight money and, until
they return to the fray, there is some
justification for expecting the market to
drift.
This has been suggested here evt
since the Federal Budget.
* ★ *
A factor possibly overlooked in ||,/
present situation is that any pressrn
on bank clients could result in some sell
ing of equities to bring overdraft Uini
into line.
Nevertheless, those with liquid fund
doubtless will find buying opportunity
in a tight money situation, particular $
among the rights issues.
Any forced selling of rights shou\
be watched closely, with a mind j
bargains.

Earning rate of 20.9 p.c. is good, bij
with a big issue coming up and a divi
dend yield of only 2.3 p.c., it is placing
a high price on the future. The stab*
lising factor, of course, is the tighf
holding of such holders as ICIANZ

tries.

profitability, but probably because of 4
425. 2d. net tangible assets backin
which some believe may be of some a
traction to a prospective bidder. Will:
out inside knowledge, it needs courag
to gamble on this sort of thing.
★ ★ ★
TTnited Holdings Ltd, the insurant
group, has been so strong in tk
market that speculators are now sugges
ing that something better than a bonui
could eventuate. That could only meal
a takeover. \
Maybe some expansion-minded com 1
petitor, nursing the problems of higl
claims in the general accident busines
could consider a merger to save e 1
penses.
★ ★ ★
Another reminder of the remarkal-
incidence of bad debts is Depoi
and Investment Co.’s report that i
general manager and nine branch man
gers had been superseded or replaci
and three branches shut down. As po-
of its reorganisation, D & 1 plans to se-
ifs city premises in Castlereagh Stre<\
to obtain greater liquidity. After writ‘s
off £l.6m. in bad debts and making
provision of £935,893 against furth
losses, the total bad debt position
stated at a staggering £2\ million.
If it hadn’t been for the strong asse
position built up over the years, it f
doubtful if the group could have wit j
stood such a battering. \

On Solid Foundations
Jennings also fair to shareholders
A . V. Jennings’ plan to raise £770,000
via an unsecured note and a pre-
ference share issue is the main plank in
the firm base which directors appear to
be laying for the future. Now, when a
buoyant building industry has lifted this
company's performance to unprece-
dented levels, moves are being made to
create buffers against those times when
trading is not so active.
Last week’s annual report revealed
that, at June 30, the assets and liabilities
of all but two of the 24 subsidiaries were
transferred to the parent company. This
move is the culmination of two years’
planning. The idea is to carry out opera-
tions on a more closely knit divisional
basis rather than under a medley of
subsidiaries, many doing similar jobs but
in different areas. The board expects
that greater efficiency will result from
this move.
Another foundation for future profits
laid in 1963-64 was the establishment of
a permanent office in Queensland and
the introduction of private housing oper-
tions in NSW. At present, house con-
struction provides 29 p.c. of the group's
turnover. General building contracts are
most important, however, providing 53.4
p.c. of turnover, while the manufacture
and supply of timber, hardware and
aluminium building products account for
the other 17.6 p.c.
Shareholders no doubt feel a little put
out to see £770,000 being raised without
any call on themselves. Around
£520,000 of this will come from 7i p.c.
unsecured notes. If a one-for-six issue of
ss. shares was made at ss. premium, the
same amount could have been raised for
a charge of only 6 p.c. after profits
(assuming the 12 p.c. dividend rate was
maintained on higher capital). Following
a record 1963-64, with sales up 40 p.c.
to £l7 million and profit up from
£281,000 to £356,000 (30 p.c. on aver-
age capital), a share issue would have
been nice icing on the cake.
But there are many other factors to
be considered. Not the least of them is
the one-for-four premium issue made
only last April. This, combined with the
dividend lift from 11 p.c. were the most
palatable aspects, for shareholders, of the
1963-64 cake. A director of the com-
pany told The Bulletin that the board
felt it might be unfair to call on share-
holders again so soon. That is disputable,
of course, but what weight his view has,
combined with the weight of further
considerations, leads one to conclude
that shareholders are being treated very
fairly.
Sounder Motelier
Tnvestors in motels will be heartened
by the news that Motels of Austra-
lia has earned a record profit. The
actual increase on 1962-63’s result of
£355,952 was only £24,344, to bring it
up to £380,296. It is evident, though,

lU dged earning rate up from 13.1 to
p 5 p.c., dividend has been cut to 10
l c a move directors foreshadowed at
[he last annual meeting. A total of
£116,406 (compared with £77,758 last
year) was provided for tax. Depreciation
provision was slightly higher at £109,082
(£105,237).
Directors said the improvement in pro-
fits was entirely due to increased motel
revenue. Number of guests accommo-
dated in the company’s TraveLodge and
Caravilla motels jumped from 633,177
lo 771,135. A higher earning rate has
been budgeted for in the current year
dependent on higher room revenues.
. Motels of Australia’s result is a step
in the right direction. As pointed out in
The Bulletin of September 26 (p. 64),
however, motels generally are more of a
long-term investment.

the shares and is leaving them at 6s. 3d.
for the time being.
\ Clean Bowled!
(Tt appears that the first catastrophe
p- from the over-capitalised, over-sup-
plied and once over-rated indoor bowling
industry may be close at hand. The rapid
expansion and avid enthusiasm of the
various operators has created a situation
where too many lanes have been provid-
ed for too few bowlers. So the earning
rates of many are proving inadequate.
Those who were first in the field rode
the initial “novelty” crest well, but now
they are settling back while some later
entrants look as if they will be hard-
pushed just to get off the ground.
I Last week’s annual report from Bowl-
O-Matic is ominous. It revealed that cer-
tain loan commitments cannot be met.
By arrangement with lenders, principal
repayments for last April to next Decem-
ber have been deferred until 1965, when
the position will be reviewed in an at-
tempt to “negotiate more realistic repay-
ment conditions”. The company is based
in Geelong (Vic.) and also operates a
centre in Dandenong.
At June 30, deferred liabilities (com-
prising mortgage loans, mainly payable
within a year, and a director’s loan also
payable within a year) totalled close on
£470,000. Current liabilities were nearly
£lOO,OOO. Against this, there are current
as sets of only £ll,OOO and fixed assets
°1 £924,000. During the year, its second
°ffull operation, £33,000 was lost com-
pared with a profit of £32,000 in 1963,
which equalled 7.1 p.c. on capital. Being
Aery conservative, company chairman T.
W Higging describes the effect of the
result on the loan position as a cause for
“considerable embarrassment”.
His description appears to fall rather
short of reality when one considers that,
forgetting write-offs and capital loss pro-
visions, the 1963-64 trading profit was
only about £4OOO. The main factor
causing the overall loss was the £36,000-
odd written off after the sale of a Frank-
ston property and after incurring costs
on other proposed centres which the
board subsequently decided not to
develop. Bowl-O-Matic’s chances of solv-
ing its current problems, let alone ever
earning at a respectable dividend-paying
rate, seem rather remote.
Revenue has been severely cut back
thanks to the fact that 1963-64 saw 92
new lanes opened in the metropolitan
area and the provincial districts near
Geelong.
Meat for Thought
HThe profit drop reported by Tancred
Bros comes after a half-yearly
announcement of difficult trading condi-
tions, a situation most meat companies
are experiencing after the cut in exports
to the US and generally higher livestock
prices.
Directors made no comment on the
lower result, confining themselves to re-
porting that profit was down from
£216,588 to £194,170 after higher tax
of £144,968 (last year £135,693) and
depreciation of £50,653 (£36,260). Earn-
ing rate moves back to 45.7 p.c. from
51.2 p.c. Dividend is held at 15 p.c. for
the third consecutive year.
Real reasons for the drop will not be
known until the balance sheet is released.
It will be interesting then to see what
remedies directors intend to take. The
European market has been suggested as
a counterbalance to reduced American
imports of Australian meat. Whether
it will completely compensate remains
to be seen.
The ss. shares are hovering around
18s., where they yield 4.2 p.c.
Coffey s Yo-Yo
Alan Coffey Motor Investments,
one of Melbourne’s unfortunate
Ford dealers, has suffered another year
of violent fluctuation. Profit dropped
from £32,000 to around £5OOO and no
dividend will be distributed. Last year
the payout was lifted from 5 p.c. to 8
p.c. after profit had jumped from the
£25,000 earned in 1962.
In the four years from 1961 to 1964,
earning rate has yo-yoed from 4 p.c.
to nearly 10 p.c., to 11 p.c. and now 2.1


AUSTRALIAN UNITED CORPORATION LIMITED
Address by the Chairman, Sir lan Potter, to the Shareholders at the
Annual General Meeting of the Company on Friday, 9th October, 1964.
It is with p.easure that I submit to
you a mo.ion for the adoption of the
seventh annual Balance Sheet and sup-
porting Accounts of Australian United
Corporation Limited, together with the
Reports of the Directors and Auditors.
The Consolidated Net Profit for the
year ended 30th June, 1964, is £551,296
compared with £613,756 for the previous
year. Of this profit, £506,734 remains
to Australian United Corporation after
allowing for the interests of minority
shareholders in the profits of subsidiary
companies; the comparable amount
last year was £564.539.
An interim dividend of 5% on the
Ordinary and Preference capital was
paid on 24th March, 1964, and the fixed
dividend of 5% on the Preference
capital was paid on 12th June, 1964. A
final dividend of 5% on the Ordinary
and Preference capital has been de-
clared payable on 9th October, 1964.
The total dividend requirement for
the year under review was £172,676
which reflects a full year’s distribution,
at unchanged rates, on capital substan-
tially increased during the course of
the previous year. The comparable
figure for last year was £138,437.
The Consolidated Net Profit for the
year ended 30th June, 1964, remaining
to AUC, after allowing for the interests
of minority shareholders in the profits
of subsidiary companies, covered the
year’s total dividend requirement
approximately three times and as a
consequence an amount of £334,058 of
the year’s profits was added to the un-
appropriated profits of the Group.
Shareholders will have noted from
the Report of the Directors that, fol-
lowing the appointment of a Receiver
of the property of Australian Factors
Limited, the Group’s shareholding in
that Company was eliminated from
the Accounts. This was effected by
writing off the cost of the investment,
less provision for appropriate taxation
allowances, from the unappropriated
profits of the Group.
After allowance for this substantial
write off of £199,500 and for the in-
creased dividend requirement and for
certain other additions to and deduc-
tions from unappropriated profits re-
ferred to in the Report of the Direc-
tors, the balance of the unappropriated
profits of the Group carried forward
to the current year is £1,323,414 com-
pared with the amount of £1,194,763
brought forward from last year.
I shall now refer to the Consolidated
Balance Sheet.
There was no change in the Paid
Up Capital of AUC during the year.
The Reserve on Consolidation has been
reduced by £128,751 principally as a
result of the progressive disposal of
assets of Sargood Gardiner Limited
during the year; this was foreshadowed
in my last address to shareholders. I
have already referred to the increase
in unappropriated profits at 30th June,
1964, and to the writing off of our
shareholding in Australian Factors
Limited. The net result of these move-
ments is a slight increase in Total
Shareholders’ Funds from £5,368,114 to
£5,386.971.
Current Liabilities increased by
£3,742,643. This reflects a rise of
approximate.y £4,000,000 in Deposits
which followed an increase in the per-
mitted level of loans accepted by our
subsidiary operating in the official
money market. Against this, £181,650
of the Registered Unsecured Notes of
Sargood Gardiner Limited was repaid
and Provision for Superannuation and
Long Service Leave was reduced by
approximately £50,000 on retirement of
a number of Sargood Gardiner Limited
employees. Bank Overdraft increased
by approximately £96,000 and Provision
for Taxation fell by £87,085.
Inves f ments in quoted securities in-
creased by £219.542 and in unquoted
securities by £564,340.
Advances increased slightly from
£2,530.230 to £2,602,540.
Current Assets rose from £26.246.529
to £29.784 673 largely as a result of the
increased portfolio of Commonwealth
Government- Securities carried by our
money market subsidiary following the
lift in permitted operating levels, to
which I have referred earlier. Stocks
on Hand and Trade Debtors fell sub-
stantially as these assess in the
accounts of Sargood Gardiner Limited
were realised.
The reduction of approximately
£300,000 in Freehold Properties is the
net result of the sale of certain prop-
erty owned by our subsidiaries Aus-
tralian United Projects Pty. Limited
and Sargood Gardiner Limited and the
acquisition of this building in which we
are meeting today. Specific Mortgages
have increased by £300,000 which is the
amount we have borrowed on long term
and at a favourable rate of interest
against this building. Substantial re-
ductions in the cost values of Plant,
Motor Vehicles and other Equipment
arose from realisation of Sargood Gar-
diner Limited assets of this nature.
Before passing from the Consolidated
Balance Sheet I should refer to our
portfolio of Commonwealth Govern-
ment Securities which is by far the
largest of our assets. This portfolio is
comprised entirely of short-term Com-
monwealth Government Securities
which support loans accepted by our
subsidiary operating in the official
money market. Shareholders will be
well aware that movements in interest
rates affect the day to day market
values of Government Securities and,
with this in mind, your Directors some
years ago established from taxed profits
an Investments Fluctuation Reserve to
meet losses which could arise if, as a
result of a substantial run down in
deposits, it became necessary to sell
Commonwealth Government Securities
at a time when market prices had
fallen below amortised prices due to
an upward movement in interest rates.
The Investment Fluctuation Reserve
has been added to each year since it
was established and at 30th June,
1964, stood at £203,000. During the
period under review it was decided that
the existence of this substantial reserve
made it more appropriate to value the
portfolio at amortised value rather
than at the lower of amortised or
market value as had been the practice
in the past. Shareholders will recall
that during the last quarter of the
1963-64 financial year interest rates on
short-term Commonwealth Governmei
Securities were moved suddenly ail
sharply upwards and, as a consequent
the market values of those securitiq
fell by substantial amounts. It was to
meet such a situation as this that you]
Directors established the Investment
Fluctuation Reserve and shareholder
will have noted from the Consolidate
Balance Sheet that the existence o'
the Reserve enabled us to absorb \
significant fall in market values ai
30th June, 1964, and still show an ex
cess of £106,301 in the market value of
the portfolio over the figure at wh»
it is carried in the Balance Sheet.
I shall now review briefly the opera
ations of our main subsidiary ant
associated companies.
Australian United Enterprises Pty.
Limited.
This subsidiary, in which the bull
of our equity investments is carried'
increased its portfolio of quoted securi-M
ties during the year from £3,577,783 tr
£4.402,491. At 30th June, 1964, the mar
ket value of these securities m
£5,458,056. Investments in security
which are not quoted also rose from
£788.338 to £856,189.
Dividend income was slightly higher,
than last year and adjustments to this
portfolio during the year again realise!
a surplus.
Australian United Underwriting Co.,
Pty. Limited
The period under review was notice
able for the limited amounts raised b
semi-governmental authorities from tli
public market. Nevertheless, this sub
sidiary was actively engaged through'
out the year as a sub-underwriter oil
industrial and commercial issues. SMf
lar conditions have continued into to
current year and we expect the volumi
of underwriting to increase in th(
present monetary situation, especiall!
in the private sector.
United Discount Company of Australia
Limited. I
I have already referred to the effec'l
of the upward movement of short-tern
interest rates in the last quarter of thf
year on the market value of the port
folio of this subsidiary which operate
in the official money market. For tli
first nine months of the year UDI
operated satisfactorily but the sudde:
and sharp lift in rates in the fine
quarter of the year placed it, in con
pany with other dealers in the officis
market, in the position where the mar
gin between the income from its port
folio and the cost of deposits was ver;
considerably narrowed. This had s
marked effect on the year’s result
which, though profitable, were belo?
those of last year. >
Your Directors welcome the remova
of fixed limits on the permitted boi
rowings of dealers who are now free ts
exercise their own judgment as to thi
appropriate level of their operations.
I again stress the need for greate.
flexibility in the type of security whid
dealers in the official money marke
are permitted to hold and I am pleasei
to observe that the authorities are cur
(Continued on next page)


p.c. Unfortunately, shareholders find it
hard to gauge what results will be like
in the future. Even interim reports are
of little help as one half year or even
any one month can be vastly different
from any other. Directors appear to be in
almost as bad a predicament—dividend
decisions are always kept until the full
year’s results are before them.
The main thorn in the dealer’s side this
year was a loss suffered in January and
February on the clearance of the 1963
Falcons. However, directors say the
new model, introduced in March, has
made each month profitable right up to
September last.
Shareholders are nevertheless feeling
apprehensive about the current year.
With Ford not holding a particularly
strong grip on its market share and BMC
planning a massive onslaught (involving
another family sedan) within twelve
months, it’s hardly possible to feel any-
thing but apprehensive as far as Alan
Coffey is concerned.
Steel Imports Again
A not-so-bright note in an otherwise
happy annual report is J. Murray-
More Holdings Ltd's announcement that
it has again became necessary to import
steel to meet customers’ needs.
Apart from this, directors say the
1963-64 year was blessed with buoyant
(Continued on page 72)
rently examining the possibility of
establishing a market in commercial
paper. It would seem appropriate also
that the Reserve Bank should be per-
mitted to buy and sell Treasury Notes
rather than be restricted to its present
role of re-discounting at a penal rate
as agent for the Treasury.
Australian United Acceptance Limited.
This subsidiary continues to provide
facilities for short-term commercial
and industrial borrowers. During a
year in which, for the greater part,
an unusually high degree of liquidity
existed, its opportunities were some-
what limited. Nevertheless, its resources
were fully employed and it operated
profitably.
Australian United Projects Pty. Limited.
In my address to shareholders last
year, I referred to the part played by
this subsidiary in planning the develop-
ment of a major building in Collins
and Elizabeth Streets in the City of
Melbourne. I am pleased to be able to
report that during the year these plans
were completed and work is currently
proceeding with Embank House in
Collins Street. This building, which it
is expected will be completed towards
the end of next year, will become a
feature in the commercial heart of the
City of Melbourne.
AUC received a 50% interest in the
equity of the development company,
Embank House Pty. Limited, in ex-
change for its interest in the land on
which the development is taking place.
Australian United Development Pty.
Limited.
There was little change in the in-
vestments of this subsidiary during the
year. It continued to operate profitably
though on a lower level than last year,
mainly due to the fact that last year’s
earnings received the benefit of several
special non-recurring dividends from
companies in which AUD has interests.
Investors Services Limited.
This Company, in which AUC is
associated with the Commercial Bank
of Australia Limited and Messrs. lan
Potter & Co., manages the Australian
Capital Fund, the Second Australian
Capital Fund and the Australian In-
come Fund, all three of which showed
satisfactory results for the year. In
May, 1964, a new investment trust, the
Collins Street Fund, was opened by In-
vestors Services Limited to provide in-
vestors with a balanced return from
fixed interest and equity holdings. As
a consequence, the total volume of in-
vestments managed by the Group has
been extended considerably
Glanvill Enthoven & Co. (Australasia)
Pty. Limited.
This Insurance Broking Company, in
which AUC holds a half-interest with
Glanvill Enthoven & Co. Limited of
London, has continued to widen the
scope of its operations. An important
development during the year was the
acquisition of the old established insur-
ance broking firm of Holland & Sons
Pty. Limited in Sydney.
Sargood Gardiner Limited.
During the year the trading assets
of this Company were progressively
liquidated and liabilities were paid out.
The principal assets remaining are two
valuable freehold properties in Sydney.
Steps are now being taken to change
the name of the Company to Australian
United Finance Limited and I feel sure
that under its new title this subsidiary
will prove to be a very useful member
of the AUC Group.
General.
I think shareholders will agree that
1964 has been another successful year
for AUC. It is true that in some direc-
tions our activities were less profitable
than last year but, as I have reminded
shareholders in the past, this is to be
expected from time to time in a
business such as ours.
Though the current year will no
doubt present its particular problems,
your Directors view the future with
confidence in the knowledge that the
condition of the Group is sound and
that it has strong and active associates
at home and abroad. AUC is therefore
in all respects equipped to play its part
in the further expansion of the Aus-
tralian economy which lies ahead.
Economic Prospects.
The outlook for the Australian
economy is indeed a good one, although
our present degree of prosperity has
its embarrassments. We have reached
a stage of full employment and as a
consequence the pressures on wages and
on the cost structure generally are
considerable. This situation has been
foreseen by the authorities and com-
mendably early steps were taken
throughout 1964 to introduce some
moderating influence in the rate of
expansion. In the financial year 1963-
64, the Australian Gross National
Product increased by 9% which,
although largely due to exports, never-
theless was very clearly a rate of
growth that could not be maintained in
a period of full employment. In order
to dampen down excessive growth, the
Reserve Bank has made several calls
on the trading banks and has indicated
to them and to the fringe banking in-
stitutions that the volume of loans
should be limited so as to minimise in-
creases in the level of aggregate ad-
vances outstanding.
Concurrently with the activities of
the Reserve Bank, we have seen this
year moderate increases in taxation
and a substantial rise in interest rates.
It is probably the first time in Aus-
tralian financial history that the in-
terest rate has been used as a direct
deterrent to expansion. It cannot be
claimed at this stage that it has suc-
ceeded in its objective, and it is to be
hoped that it can be established that
the end has justified the means. Such
arbitrary movements of interest rates
by official action must unfortunately
do a great deal to undermine the tech-
nical efficiency of the Australian money
market.
It is to be hoped, therefore, that the
efforts of the authorities to limit the
effect of the present upward pressure
on costs will prove successful in the
relatively near future. In this respect,
I am not without some optimism. Ever
since 1960, the Australian economy has
been wary of too rapid an expansion,
and has shown a growing degree of
responsibility for national stability.
This is reflected in the present high
level of savings in a community that
is fully employed, with no real pros-
pects of a reversal in the ruling state
of prosperity. Provided limitation of
spending in the private sector is not
counteracted by augmented expendi-
ture in the public sector, there seems
to be no reason why the present up-
ward pressures should not be contain-
ed. The pressures may become great-
est in the period immediately ahead,
but on the present level of imports it
would not be surprising if there was
some reduction in the stimulation that
Australia has received in the last two
years from the buoyant state of its
balance of payments.
It would be wrong to take the view
that the problem is other than the
need to check the rate of growth. We
are not experiencing or facing boom
conditions. An “acceptable” rate of in-
crease in the Gross National Product
of 4-2% to 5% would still call for very
great economic activity throughout the
community. If we can limit the tempo
of expansion to that level, we should
achieve the twin objectives of prosperity
and stability. It is in this atmosphere
that your Directors look forward to
the months ahead with considerable
interest in the knowledge that the Cor-
poration should find ample outlet for
its resources and for the services that
its organisation can offer.
Staff.
Your Directors again wish to place
on record their appreciation of the
work done by the staff and I am sure
shareholders will join with me in
thanking them for their continued
loyalty and efficiency throughout the
year.

into the current year and all subsidiaries
are still achieving increases in sales.
Equally satisfactory profits should be
earned this year.
The 20s. shares appear fairly priced

Resolved Dilemma?
Tt is rapidly being accepted in many
quarters that city hotels, especially
in Sydney and Melbourne, are in for a
tough time unless some sort of rationa-
lisation or rejuvenation is quickly insti-
gated. However, last week’s annual
meeting of the Windsor Hotel, Mel-
bourne, suggested that this particular
company may not have to be subjected
to such drastic measures.
Of course this may be glossing the
picture over somewhat, as the hotel
building itself has already undergone
considerable alteration and extension,
during which profits have suffered to no
meagre extent. Combining this factor
with the general bad times, earning rate
has declined from 19.8 p.c. in 1960 to
14.4 p.c., 12 p.c., 4.6 p.c. and recovered
to 6.9 p.c. in 1963-64.
Nothing can alter the fact, though,
that the latest lift in earning rate and
the lift which is likely again this year
are largely due to reducing the influ-
ence which occupancy rates have on
profits.
At the meeting, shareholders were told
that trading had further improved in the
first quarter of the current year. Results
from the banquet rooms and bars in the
new building had been up to expecta-
tions in 1963-64 but occupancy was
generally disappointing. So, despite the
poor occupancy, it seems that profits
will improve this year.
Does this move by the Windsor herald
the beginning of a new era in the role
of hotels? The possibility is logical. A
losing battle is being fought as far as
occupancy is concerned. So a shift in
emphasis to better bar conditions, pro-
viding reception and convention facili-
ties, creating a licensed-restaurant type
dining atmosphere and maybe even pro-
viding entertainment seem fair enough
ways to remove any hotel from the
current dilemma.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Confident But Rather Overpriced
Pye Industries basking in light of remarkable 1962-63
fpHE market in Pye Industries Ltd
*- shares remains very confident
despite the reduced earnings in the year
to March 31, 1964. During October
the shares have added another Is. 6d. so
that, at the time of writing, the last sale
took place at 225. 6d. On the occa-
sion of the last article about fifteen
months ago the price was 10s. Bd. (on
a comparable basis), so an appreciation
of 111 p.c. has taken place.
There are a number of good reasons
for the stock's popularity, based on the
nature of its products. Through Tecnico
Electronics Pty. Ltd. (a wholly owned
subsidiary), it seems that Pye will be
producing a range of precision electro-
nic equipment in addition to printed
circuit boards and it can be assumed
with a certain amount of confidence that
this industry has considerable growth
prospects in the next decade or so.
The Bendix-Tecnico group consists of
Bendix-Tecnico Pty Ltd, which produces
specialised equipment for government
departments including the defence
forces and for the airlines, and Bendix-
Tecnico (Automotive) Pty Ltd, which
produces carburettors, fuel pumps, oil
filters, air filters and other components
for the automotive industry.
Nevertheless, the Pye Industries’
group tends to be regarded as mainly a
producer of household equipment, par-
ticularly of television sets. It may well
be that the emphasis is changing,
although it was stated in the address to
shareholders in 1962 that “Pye Indus-
tries Ltd’s contribution to the group
profits again represents the more sub-
stantial part of the total”. In that year
the net profit from trading of Pye Indus-
tries was £122,612, while the same item
for the group was £377,923 (i.e., Pye
Industries’ profit apparently represented
32.4 p.c. of the total). The following
year this percentage appears to have
become 42.6, despite the fact that the
directors’ report for that year states:
“Trading of the parent company was
maintained at a satisfactory level, but
profits were affected by the writing-off
of bad and doubtful debts amounting to
£239,333”.
Co far as the last year to March 31,
1964, was concerned, the directors
point out that the results of the parent
company are not comparable as mer-
chandising activities have been trans-
ferred to another subsidiary. However, it
may perhaps be .of interest to look a little
closer at the parent company’s figures
for the three years up to and including
the year ended March 31, 1963.

Tax provided 121 87 198
Investment income—from subsids. 5 57 102
—from others 5 12 23
These figures, in my view, indicate
not only the cyclical nature of the
durable consumer goods side of the
group—particularly as it seems likely
that the 1964 figures were down again
—but also the increasing contribution
to profits being made by the subsidiary
companies and the investment in “other
companies”. This latter investment con-
tributed nearly £37,000 in 1963-64,
thus showing an increase of nearly
60 p.c. over the previous year.
It must be admitted that the figures
shown in the above table do not dis-
close the situation, since they indicate
only the income which has been re-
ceived from the investment and in Pye
Industries’ accounts this income is
described as “interest received”. If it
can be assumed that the difference be-
tween the consolidated figures and the
parent company’s figures for net profit
before tax, depreciation and interest
represents the subsidiaries’ contribution,
the pattern is even more dramatic. The
trend is somewhat similar in the “minor-
ity shareholders’ share of profits”.

Naturally these figures can only be
taken as a guide. Despite the fact that
it seems probable that the profitability
of the subsidiaries’ activities also de-
clined in 1963-64 there is now probably
far less dependence on the household
electrical goods industry’s fortunes than
previously. But it is difficult to deter-
mine the extent to which past profits
have been due to the finance companies.
The extent to which this side of the busi-
ness could have grown in recent years
might be judged from the volume of
fixed interest borrowings, including
short-term deposits and the interest
paid on fixed term loans.

The directors’ address of 1962 states
that “the profit contribution from these
companies in the accounts under review
is small” and “current figures are en-
couraging and a steadily increasing flow
of profits from these companies may be
anticipated in the future”. While, as
mentioned earlier, the 1962-63 figures
were apparently affected by bad debts
incurred in the parent company, one
could perhaps feel that the fall in pro-
fits in 1963-64 might have been due in
part at least to the problems which the
finance companies had to face in that
year.
current prices, the shares show a
dividend yield of 2.2 p.c. and an
earnings yield of 6 p.c. The present price
seems to be based on the per share
earnings of 1962-63, which would make
the earnings yield nearly 9 p.c. This
seems to be a more realistic figure,
having regard to the fluctuating nature
of earnings and the very slight growth
which has occurred in dividends per
share. Furthermore one cannot disre-
gard the possibility that the 1962-63
year may have been an exceptional year
in many ways.
All factors considered, I would feel
that the shares could be overpriced at
225. 6d., although they were certainly
very attractive fifteen months ago at an
equivalent price of 10s. Bd.. even with-
out the remarkable short-term apprecia-
tion which has taken place.

(Incorporated in New South Wales)
CHAIRMAN'S ADDRESS delivered at
THE FOURTEENTH ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
OF MEMBERS OF THE COMPANY, 9th October, 1964
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am pleased to be able to report to the Fourteenth Annual
General Meeting that the Corporation has completed another
successful year’s trading.
This has been achieved despite fluctuations in the general
economy. However, the current economic conditions indicate
a controlled growth in the prosperity of the nation in which
we are well equipped to participate.
Certainly, indications are that the current year will maintain
our progress. This situation should prove satisfying to share-
holders and investors.
FINANCIAL:
During the past year the Corporation’s net tangible assets
increased from £1,663,200 at 30th June, 1963, to £1,741,133
at 30th June, 1964, In accordance with my announcement of
dividend policy at the Annual General Meeting in 1963 your
Directors are recommending a final dividend of 5% which
will make 10% for the year. The result achieved during the
past year was pLeasing because, to some extent, profit was
affected by your Directors’ decision to accumulate liquidity
in anticipation of the maturing debenture currency of
£1,250,000 on the 30th June last.
It will be noted in the Directors’ Report contained in the
Balance Sheet that redemptions of debentures were at a lower
rate than provided for. However, your Directors believe their
policy on liquidity was prudent in all the circumstances.
Accumulating liquid funds must and did restrict opportunities
for lending, thereby affecting profits. As maturities for future
years are more evenly spaced, this situation will not apply to
the same extent. However, our policy of adequate liquidity
will be maintained as a sound security factor for investors.
Net profit of the Corporation amounted to £227,635. This
figure was arrived at after providing for tax £68,343, allow-
ance for depreciation £22,076, and after writing off all known
bad debts.
The payment of 10% dividend will absorb £149,319 and the
Directors have recommended that £50,000 of the remaining
balance in the Profit and Loss Appropriation Account be
transferred to General Reserve.
OUTSTANDINGS:
During the past year, your Directors continued their strict
policy of maintaining sound security and control in all
accounts.
The result of this policy is that the Corporation’s shareholders,
debenture holders and note holders have been given a very
high degree of security in support of their investment. As
the Consolidated Balance Sheet shows, the Corporation’s out-
standings at 30th June, 1964, stood at £17,173,316 against
£16,791,134 at 30th June, 1963. Of the outstandings,
£12,563,102 was secured by Long- and Short-Term Mort-
gages while £3,354,608 is on Hire Purchase and Secured Loans
with £1,255,606 on Mortgages and Other Receivables where
charges not written in.
NEW FUNDS:
The debenture issue recently closed by the Corporation was
most successful and we have now opened a composite deben- E
ture and note issue which, we believe, will be similarly suc-f
cessful. I
A pleasing feature of your Corporation’s debenture and note}
issues is the continued and steady support of the investing!
public which has been maintained over the years. \
With the confidence of the investing public in the Corpora-)
tion and the satisfactory collections from borrowers, the.
Corporation is able to maintain steady lending and profit-
able trading.
EXPANSION:
During the past financial year 1 am happy to report renova-
tions to the Corporation’s building, from which our business!
in Queensland is conducted, were mainly completed.
Early in 1964, the Corporation entered into negotiations for
the purchase of a building known as B.P. House in Adelaide
for use as our State Branch Headquarters. It will become
available for occupancy soon.
Ideally situated in the centre of Adelaide’s commercial area,
it should lead to more rapid expansion of operations there.
Contained in the Balance Sheet before you are photographs
which we consider will be of interest to the shareholders,!
showing the Corporation’s properties in various capital cities.
BUSINESS TRENDS:
I am happy to announce that on the sound basis of
established by the Management of the Corporation, we con-
tinue to experience no difficulty in the lending of funds to
borrowers with sound security.
The problem of bad debts has been largely avoided by the
policy of your Directors in concentrating on real estate fin-
ancing and a selective acceptance of hire purchase agree-
ments. Furthermore, close surveillance is maintained on all t
accounts continuously.
Every account in the ledgers is examined by the Corpora-
tion’s auditors at various times throughout the year. This
ensures that any bad debts are written off and taken into
account in the Profit and Loss Account.
A computer has been placed on order and on installation is
expected to assist considerably in the processing of debenture
and note registers as well as simplifying a number of othei
accounting procedures.
We have noted the policy statement issued by the Governoi
of the Reserve Bank and the Corporation will adjust its
trading policy to assist the authorities in maintaining a stable
economy.
CONCLUSION:
From what I have stated to you and from the accounts before
you I am certain that you will share my confidence in the
Corporation’s future and that we may look forward to further
progress in this current financial year and the years ahead.
I know you would, therefore, wish me to convey to the staff
your appreciation of their loyalty and efforts for a job well
done.

Chairman of Directors.


BHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Rarely Any Boredom Here
Holding the shares of Ralph McKay
tjtHERE are two basic reasons lying be-
A hind the success which has branded
1962-63 and now 1963-64 as “best ever”
years for Ralph McKay Ltd —a buoyant
agricultural industry and an expanding
[xport trade. The first has always been
'the vital factor affecting profits and
always will be. Only in the last three
«kars or so have exports become impor-
tant, too, suggesting a healthy trend as
jfar as the future is concerned since, in
'times of poor local demand, export sales
: may well prevent serious setbacks.
The group is centred in Melbourne,
Where the parent and three subsidiaries
were incorporated—Welch Perrin Indus-
tries, Welch Perrin and Co., and Ralph
■McKay (Aust.). The latter is a revamped
Aversion of Hampton-McKay, a vice and
small tool manufacturing venture entered
into jointly with C. and J. Hampton Ltd,
k Sheffield, England. Local competi-
tion proved too deadly for the company,
so, after suspending production, RM
purchased the English interest. Last
March the name was changed and the
.subsidiary is now operating “satisfactor-
ily” as a manufacturing and marketing
unit for agricultural wheels and rims.
An associate, Wheels and Rims Aus-
tralia Pty Ltd, is owned equally by RM,
Dunlop and Olympic. In 1963-64, pro-
fitable operations were achieved for the
first time. In fact, demand reached a
stage in the latter six months where
around-the-clock production was neces-
sary. Output is not entirely for agricul-
tural use, but is for general trucks, trac-
tors, cranes, etc.
Under the Welch Perrin flag and that
of another subsidiary, Port Implements in
Adelaide, production is centred on discs
and coulters for agricultural implements,
forgings (for general engineering), circu-
lar meat knives, pressings, stampings,
cultivator points and tynes, harvesting
machinery and several other agricultural
implements.
pROM this list, it is quite obvious that
steel supplies are nearly as important
1° the company’s prosperity as the
.seasonal conditions affecting the rural
industry. Company chairman Mr Oscar
McKay emphasises the importance of
re gular and adequate local steel supply
when he reviews the group every year.
The poor results of 1961 and 1962, apart
from the depressed economic conditions,
Wer e, in addition, a reflection of RM’s
.need to import stee'l in those years.
1 Apart from the general disruption this
caused, profit margins were also cut
because imports were more expensive
than the local supplies. Of course, part
of the solution to this is stockpiling,
which is exactly what RM does. Hence
the extremely high current asset figure
and the very liquid working capital posi-
tion shown in the accompanying table.
But stockpiling never solves the problem
of a local shortage completely, nor even
remotely if things get really bad. No
matter how serious the situation has
been, a certain amount of disruption
must result afterwards when stockpiling
has to be resumed.
According to Mr McKay, improved
manufacturing efficiency was another
factor helping profits in 1963-64. Com-
bined with the sales lift, ,it absorbed the
added costs of the basic wage and an
extra week’s annual leave for employees,
for the time being. Thus, he describes
the prospects for 1964-65 as “good, sub-
ject to normal seasonal conditions, but
higher costs and increased taxation must
impose an added burden”. Continuing,
“The supply of Australian-made steel
must always be a major factor in the
efficient running of our plants and I
sincerely trust sufficient materials will be
available to us during the year”.
’C'xport sales made “a very important
contribution” to the 1963-64 effort
and this should be the position in the
future too. If nothing else, they provide
the group with a means of stabilising
profits in bad times at home and boost-
ing them substantially when both the
export and local markets prove demand-
ing. At present, activity and research is
high in this field and several new outlets
should be opened up this year. It appears
that considerable success may be scored
m New Zealand especially. Steps have
been taken there to establish a manu-
facturing division, mainly for potato
machinery.
What, then, does the company offer a
prospective investor? Initially, it must
be remembered that fluctuating earnings
will be as much a characteristic in the
future as they have been in the past. This
feature will be toned down gradually,
however, thanks to exports and the
shares which Borg-Warner acquired in
1960 (they comprise £160,000 of the
ordinary capital shown in the table) in
exchange for technical information. Un-
fortunately it must be remembered, too,
that agricultural prosperity and steel sup-
plies are the two vital items over which
directors hold no control. So any pros-
pect for complete stability in the future
is non-existent.
Still, stability is something which a
lot of investors are not primarily inter-
ested in. There’s rarely any boredom
while holding RM shares. In fact, the
present shareholders are hoping for
capital benefits from the company very
soon. Several items of the group’s
financial set-up point to this.
tpiRSTLY, there have been no share-
A holders’ issues since 1955-56. Moves
have been made for other purposes, like
Borg-Warner and the 1959 Welch Perrin
takeover. This does not alter the fact
that shareholders have had a lean time
for almost a decade, following on from
what could be termed an “issue-rash” in
the years immediately after listing. In
1951-52 and 1952-53 two separate ones
were made at a 7s. 6d. premium. Quiet
times in 1953-54 and 1954-55 were well
and truly made up for in 1955-56 —
two-for-five at par, a share split, then a
four-for-five bonus.
Needless to say, such moves brought
about drastic earnings setbacks. In fact,
dividend had been 20 p.c. prior to 1955-
56, when it was cut to 10 p.c.; then 8k
p.c. in 1956-57 before a climb to the
present basic rate of 12k p.c. in 1959.
The issueless period to date has un-
doubtedly been due partly to the lessons
learnt in those years. Now the picture
is different.
Some observers have even given time
to bonus thoughts now that reserves
have climbed to be almost as big as paid
capital.
Yet hopes should really go no higher
than a cash issue and probably that
would be at a premium. Dividend could
be maintained easily seeing earnings have
now topped 30 p.c. The NZ project
and extensions planned for the Mel-
bourne and Adelaide plants will all re-
quire cash. The 1963-64 dividend lift
from the basic rate of 14k p.c. does not
lessen issue chances. The extra 2 p.c.
comes from a tax-paid reserve account,
not from profits.
Hence, the sum for dividends in-
cluded in the table does not involve this
extra payment, just the normal 12k p.c.
plus a six-month dividend on the Borg-
Warner scrip which only ranked for divi-
dends from January 1 last. The earning
rates shown have been calculated on
capital including Borg-Warner's £160,000
contribution, even though it did not rank
for dividends until this year.
However, detracting from issue hopes,
Mr McKay has said that, apart from the
special 2 p.c. dividend, funds should be
reserved for future growth. Does this
imply that expansion will be financed
without shareholders’ help? Possibly it

does. Such was the case in 1961. The
table shows that the big jump in fixed
assets that year was financed entirely by
loan capital. This debt has been reduced
every year and there should be no
trouble in eliminating it altogether by
the due date, 1970.
Thus, there is considerable confusion
at present over the chances of Ralph
McKay making an issue. The market
price reflects this. At 19s. and yield-
ing 3.3 p.c. from the dividend, prices
are too high to provide income attrac-
tion and yet not high enough if an issue
is considered as more-than-likely. Any
sharp price jump now will indicate that
an issue is on the way.
So far, a buoyant 1964-65 seems to be
on the cards. Close scrutiny of the
interim report will prove valuable and
investors should keep an eye out for any
wind of agricultural and industrial pro-
blems affecting the company. In the
long run, capital benefits will definitely
accrue. For the immediate future, pros-
pects are in the balance.
KEITH HARRIS AND CO. LTD
Most Fruitful of Issue
Ohareholders of Keith Harris and Co.
Ltd should have no complaints with
the results of their company— three
bonus issues in the past four years is
no mean achievement and on each occa-
sion directors have maintained dividend
payments on the higher capital.
The latest issue is on a one-for-four
basis. Previous issues, in 1960 and
1961, were both on a one-for-six basis.
Keith Harris and Co. was formed in
1933 and converted to a public company
in 1948. Stock exchange listing fol-
lowed a placement of a parcel of ss.
shares at Bs. plus brokerage. Paid-up
capital at this stage was £75,000 in
15,000 20s. 5 p.c. preference shares and
240,000 ss. ordinary shares. In 1957,
the preference dividend was raised to/
7 p.c.
Since flotation the company has been
particularly generous to shareholders,)
They were able to participate in three
cash issues, all at par, between 1950 and
1959 (5-for-12, l-for-2 and l-for-3) and
then the bonus issues. Assuming that a;
shareholder obtained 100 shares on the
original float and took up all his entitle-
ments, he would now hold, after the
bonus, 475 shares worth on current
market values about £BOO, quite apart
from the dividend income received.
The company is one of the largest sup-
pliers of pure and synthetic flavoring
essences, edible color powders and other
preparations for the food and drink
industry. It also makes highly specia-
lised perfumery compounds, cake orna-
ments, disinfectants and essential oils,;
and imports allied products from over-
seas. It markets through branches in all
States, as well as conducting an export
trade with the Pacific Islands.
Expansion has been careful and re-
warding, both for the company
shareholders. In 1960, it acquired Jus-!
frute Ltd, of Gosford, by a share issue
at a substantial premium. Most of this
premium was redistributed to share-
holders as a bonus later in the year.
Similarly an issue of 82,500 shares to a
Swiss associate, Firmenich et Cie, pro-
vided the basis for the 1961 bonus. The.
Swiss firm subsequently sold its interest
in 1964 and has gone into Australian
operations on its own account.
The latest acquisition, the Tom-A-Tol
group of companies which manufactures
similar products, was also made by a
share issue at a premium. This, together 1
with other capital reserves, has financed
the latest bonus.
The company is in a particularly
healthy state. The latest balance sheet,
made up to June 30, shows reserves
totalling £473,447 prior to the acquisition
of the Tom-A-Tol group. Net assets
backing of each ss. share was 13s. 7d.
Liquidity is particularly high, with

£108,559 in cash and £90,522 on fixed
deposit.
Profit for the latest year continued the
rising trend begun in 1956. At £123,665,
equal to 42.8 p.c. on capital, it was
almost twice the £65,388 earned in 1961.
The 1963 profit was £100,660, equal to
36.4 p.c. on capital. Dividend for the
past three years has been a well-covered
\U p.c. and directors expect to pay
this rate after the latest bonus.
Turnover in the latest year was again
a record, with sales of factory products
showing further gains in every trading
location. Gross profit margins were
maintained on the increased business.
Accounts of the Jusfrute subsidiary
covered 15 months, in order to bring it
into line with the rest of the group. The
extra three months’ contribution had
little effect on overall results, as the
period from April to June is the slack
period in the citrus fruit processing in-
dustry.
During the year the extensions to the
factory at Thornleigh were completed.
Work was begun on a new factory at
Gosford over and above the substantial
amounts spent on new equipment during
the year.
The shares are currently selling at
42s. cum the bonus issue, equivalent to
about 33s. 6d. ex-bonus. At this price
there appears little in them for short-
term capital appreciation, but they could
well be locked away for the long term.
A cash issue is most unlikely, yet the
company’s strength is such that within a
few years another bonus could well come
to light.
The reserve position is strong. General
reserve stands in the books at £425,000,
more than equal to the present capital.
Even after the bonus issue, net assets
backing of each 10s. share is 26s. 2d.
The shares are currently selling at 40s.
cum the bonus issue, equivalent to
36s. 4d. ex bonus. Even at this level,
the shares are a good lock-away propo-
sition.
J. BLACKWOOD AND SON LTD
Bonus Prospect Comes Good
IThe recent one-for-ten bonus issue by
J. Blackwood and Son Ltd did not
surprise, as the company has been a
prime bonus prospect for some consider-
able time. In fact, even after this issue,
capital reserves are still sufficient to
sustain a two-for-five bonus.
handles a wide range of
merchandise including copper, brass and
other non-ferrous metals, steel plates,
sections and pipes, pipe fittings, valves
and plumbers’ brassware, engineers’
handtools, precision and small tools,
engine packings and jointings, bolts and
nuts, rivets and screws, welding equip-
ment and general engineering and plumb-
ing requirements.
The major part of its business is done
in the industrial centres of Sydney, New-
castle and Port Kembla. During the
latest year it extended its activities to
Canberra by the acquisition of an
established business, W. R. McKerrow
(Holdings) Pty Ltd, , plumbing and
building supplier.
The only other operating subsidiary is
A. E. Baker and Co. (Holdings) Pty Ltd,
°f Parramatta, acquired in 1961. Until
the 1963-64 financial year, this offshoot
did not make a very large contribution
jo group profit. The parent company
« still the major operator of the group.
Capital growth since flotation has been
fairly slow, with the only cash issue to
shareholders being a one-for-two at par
in 1959. The acquisition of A. E. Baker
and W. R. McKerrow were both
financed by share placements at a pre-
mium. It was these premiums which
enabled the company to make the bonus
issue. Paid up capital since the bonus
stands at £419,384.
The past year has been a record one,
with sales up 12i p.c. to a peak
£2,885,648. Two years ago they totalled
£2,330,832.
In line with this rise in sales, profit
for the year was also a record —-
£104,624, equal to 28.4 p.c. on average
capital employed during the year. The
newly acquired subsidiary contributed
only two months’ results to this figure.
In the previous year, profit declined from
£96,339 to £91,318. Nevertheless, the
25.8 p.c. earning rate gave a wide cover
to the 16 p.c. dividend paid each year
since 1959-60.
The latest accounts show the company
to be in a very strong liquid position.
Stock is down from £664,997 to
£621,819, while trade debtors are higher
at £614,555 compared with £509,765 a
year earlier.
Trade creditors are more than doubled
from £123,281 to £259,271 and bank
overdraft is almost halved from
£254,941 to £128,695.


Company Meeting:
TWENTY-NINTH ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
25th SEPTEMBER, 1964
At this, our Twenty-ninth Annual General
Meeting, it is my pleasure to report to you on
the Company's activities for the twelve months
ended June, 1964.
Balance Sheet Comparison
Briefly commenting on the report attached
to the Balance Sheet, I think the figures present
a creditable performance in view of the con-
ditions that prevailed, during which period most
Finance Companies with ample funds available
introduced strong competition by reduced rates
and more liberal terms. Our figures confirm
the diversification referred to in past years and
indicate a rise in turnover which resulted in
15.6% increase in gross outstandings, whilst
the Group Consolidated Net Profit, after tax,
amounted to £401,633, or 9.23% increase on
last year, the percentage of net profit to
ordinary capital (after payment of preference
dividend) rose to 17.46%.
Taxation of £171,519 has been provided at
the new increased rate and is £45,535 higher
than last year.
From the accumulated profits of past years,
we have transferred from the Profit and Loss
Appropriation Account to the General Reserve
Account the sum of £149,931; this brings the
General Reserve Account of the Parent Com-
pany to a round figure of £400,000.
Dividends
Dividends amounting to £35,000 were paid
on the due date to our Cumulative Preference
Shareholders and an interim dividend on
ordinary shares of 5% was paid in April, 1964
It is now recommended to pay a final dividend
of 7f per cent on the Ordinary Capital amount-
ing to £157,500, which, together with the
interim, makes a total ordinary dividend of
121 per cent for the year. This is for your
confirmation.
Survey of Year’s Trading
On occasions I have mentioned that trading
in the Finance industry was becoming highly
competitive and this state of affairs certainly
persisted during the year under review.
• we Y er > there is no sign of any abatement
in this situation and, in fact, the move of one
large Finance Company, who during the year
reduced car rates, has brought about a general
reduction of finance rates for those well-known
makes that command a large share of the
market. Fortunately, our policy of diversifica-
tion into other avenues of finance has reduced
our dependence on Motor Car Hire Purchase,
although competition continues to be strong
in all sections.
Nevertheless we were able to maintain our
position and the increased volume of business
was also reflected in a rise in net outstandings
of £2,601,358, i.e., 14.4 per cent, at 30th June,
1964, as compared with the corresponding date
last year.
The results submitted to you were arrived at
after writing off ascertained bad debts and
increasing the provision for doubtful debts to
£126,660.
In terms of business written, the current year
has opened promisingly and indications since
the 30th June last are that a steady, but per-
haps moderate, increase should be maintained.

Fund Raising
Our No. 6 Debenture Issue for £500,000
closed on October 15 of last year with total,
subscriptions of £1,887,650; the No. 7 Issue,
also for £500,000, was opened in December, 1
1963, and closed on the sth June, 1964, with
applications totalling £2,000,000, this being the
maximum amount acceptable under the Pros-F
pectus.

Capital Increase <
As mentioned in last year’s report, 12,326,
shares of 5/- each were duly allotted at par ■
to the Mercantile Credits Limited Staff Retire- ,
ment Fund, and this caused the increase in the;
paid-up ordinary capital to £2,100,000.
Following on a recent Press announcement, (
it is indeed a happy day for me to confirm that ]
announcement by stating that we have a new ,
and valuable partner, namely, The Hongkong'
and Shanghai Banking Corporation, who have
taken a 40 per cent equity interest by sub- ]
scribing for 5,600,000 shares in the capital of i
the Company at a premium of 2/6 per share.L
May I quote these remarks, viz.: “The Hong-’i
kong and Shanghai Barking Corporation, with ,
its Head Office in Hong Kong, was established'
in 1865 and has become the centre of a Group
which is a complex network of international
banking, with a comprehensive chain of over
150 offices stretching from Casablanca through
the Near, Middle and Far East to Tokyo and
in San Francisco, New York, London, Paris
and Hamburg.” ,
Their present paid-up capital and published
Reserves are just on £2om. Sterling, i.e.f
£25,000,000 Australian, and at December, 1963,
their assets amounted to more than £Boom.
(Aust.).
I welcome them as a powerful partner and
I am sure that the association over the years 1
will be of great benefit to both of us.

address, you will receive a short history of this
famous Bank, which 1 know you will read with

Our Role in the Economy
As you are no doubt aware, Mercantile
Credits Limited is a member of the Australian 1
Hire Purchase and Finance Conference, and I.
(Continued on next page)
THE HONGKONG AND
SHANGHAI BANKING
CORPORATION
The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation was founded in Hong Kong
by a group of merchants representing the
foreign mercantile community with trading
interests in Hong Kong, China and Japan.
The Bank opened for business on 3rd
March, 1865, branches were opened in
Shanghai and in London shortly after-
wards and a world - wide network of
agencies in the principal ports was estab-
lished during that year. A branch system
was developed as the growth of business
justified such expansion. The Bank was
the first British bank to open an office in
New York in 1879, in what is now known
as Thailand at Bangkok in 1888, in Ham-
burg in 1889, and it is the oldest surviv-
ing British bank in Japan and in France.
The Head Office of the Bank has been
in Hong Kong, except for the period from
December, 1941, to April, 1946, when the
Flead Office of the Bank was in London
owing to the Pacific War and 36 of its
42 branches were in enemy hands. The
sequence of events in China following the
end of the Second World War culminated
in the winding up of its business in that
country, but it still maintains a small office
in Shanghai.
Although the Bank has been represented
in San Francisco since 1865, first by
agents and then by its own office from
1875, it was not until 1955 that it
established its own subsidiary. The Hong-
kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation
of California, which enables it to engage
in domestic banking business in that State.
In 1959 the Bank completed the acquisi-
tion of the entire share capital of Mer-
cantile Bank Limited, an old established
bank which traces its origin back to 1853,
and at the end of that year had acquired
almost the whole issued share capital of
The British Bank of the Middle East,
which has a 49 per cent interest in the
Bank of Iran and the Middle East. In
1960 a subsidiary company, Wayfoong
Finance Limited, was formed to take over
its growing hire purchase finance business
in Hong Kong.
The local bank, founded in Hong Kong
in 1865, has become the centre of a
Group which is a complex network of
international banking with a compre-
hensive chain of over 150 offices stretch-
ing from Casablanca through the Near,
Middle and Far East to Tokyo and in
San Francisco, New York, London, Paris
and Hamburg.

think k can safely be said that the status of
ij, e Conference as an influence in the Aus-
tralia 0 economy continues to be respected.
, jhe state of the economy in Australia is the
climate in which the finance industry lives and
(breathes. This climate has been very variable
the past few years, changing quite rapidly
from conditions of boom and inflation to
recession and “squeeze” and then to today’s
pore controlled growth and development.
f The finance industry has a part in setting
he economic climate, but also suffers from
its vagaries.
Nowadays the industry takes a more mature,
esponsible and realistic view of its place in
he economy, an attitude which serves a double
mrpose.
This maturity helps set a climate in which
ihe industry works most efficiently and profit-
ably, and at the same time helps to dampen
‘put or forestall those aspects which can damage
: br inhibit it.
i With the economy generally, there have been
'many changes within the finance industry in
/the past few years.
1 As in other industries, costs are rising and
efforts are being redoubled to try to keep costs
;to a minimum. Even so, overall industry profit-
ability has fallen to a point where finance
companies’ average net profit in relation to net
[outstanding balances is 1.8 per cent. In 1956,
'this figure was about 5 per cent.
There have been changes too in the con-
ditions governing the finance companies’ access
to funds, and the industry is paying much more
attention to the intelligent management of these
unds and the protection of those who sub-
icribe them.
i At present there is somewhat more than
£450 million lodged with finance companies in
deposits, notes and debentures.
Borrowing periods tend to be longer and
there is now a tendency for interest rates to
rise, following the generally lower rates of
the past three years.
However, it is unlikely that this increase
will result in a rise in lending rates. If it
comes at all, this increase is more likely to
be the result of spiralling overheads including
Stamp Duties.
The industry has been carrying out a cam-
paign aimed at educating Australians in the
wise use of instalment credit. This education
campaign, encouraging high deposits and short
repayment periods, has been welcomed by
many sections of the community, including the
Treasury and the Reserve Bank.
Today there is more and more emphasis on
the word “service” in our industry, and we
at Mercantile Credits feel that this must react
to our own benefit as well as to the benefit of
our clients.
Executive and Staff
0° 3rd July last, the Managing Director,
Mr M. D. Thompson, completed 25 years as
ar! employee of the Company, and I take this
opportunity of recording the Board’s apprecia-
°on of the long and loyal service given by him
during those years.
The Board’s appreciation also goes to all
e Mcutives and staff who played their individual
PWs to make possible the year’s results now
Emitted to you. I am sure you will concur
these remarks.
I now formally move the adoption of the
and Report as tabled and, when this
oa s been seconded, the matter will be open
lor discussion.
D. C. CAMERON,
Chairman.
SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Time for Great Rejoicing
And taking some real profits, too
tpHE last few months have been
A difficult ones for both share traders
and investors. My praise goes to those
who have experienced otherwise.
As for myself, I had just stumbled
along, hesitant to make any major move.
So when the portfolio rose almost £5OO
last week, it was a time not only for
great rejoicing but an opportunity to
take some profits.
A. G. Sims jumped to 6s. 4d. after
the chairman stated that there would be
a return of capital when the remainder
of the Morts Dock property was sold.
With prospects of further increases in
profit, the earning rate on the lower
capital should become quite respectable.
In due course the shares should rise a
little further. I’m happy, though, to
accept a profit of £73.
Another stock that showed a good
jump was Tableland Tin. The subject of
tin has been discussed frequently in this
column since the beginning of the year.
Early in the year the world tin price
rose to £stgl2so per ton, came back
almost to the £lOOO mark and then
blazed upward to the present price of
£stgl6so. As a defensive measure I sold
off 200 Tableland to give a profit of £5O.
Other notable rises were Malleys (up
Is. 6d.), Treloar (up Is.), Protector rights
(up 35.), and even Commercial Guaranty
(up 5d.). Now that this last stock is
almost above my average purchase price,
I’ll ease myself out in the next week or
so.
On the buying side this week was
Cope Allman, Westralian Oil and
Ansett.
Cope Allman (Australia) Ltd is the
new name for the reconstructed PPW
Holdings. Last financial year PPW
showed a profit of £22,000 from its
coal hopper trucks and investments.
Now, in its new form, directors expect
profits to rise almost fourteen times!
Boy, that’s real growth! On the new
capital of £140,000, the estimated earn-
ing rate is 210 p.c.
Fortunately the directors do give
some genuine reasons for this expected
profit jump. Firstly the subsidiary Cope
Allman (South Africa) Ltd, which is 7li
p.c. owned, should earn about £150,000.
Then the largest of the local subsidiaries,
Popolare Metal Stamping Co. Pty Ltd,
is expected to earn about £75,000. The
other local subsidiaries should make up
the balance.
To get sufficient spread, the shares
were placed with employees at 20s.
just eight times the par value of 2s. 6d.
A high price, but with an earnings yield
of 25 p.c. you can’t go far wrong. I
managed to buy 200 at 21s. 3d.
My interest in Westralian arose when
it announced a profit of £69,000. The
year’s fall of £31,000 seemed to take
the market by surprise as it knocked the
price down to 2s. lOd. Is. below the
peak for the year. Yet in the interim
report it was specifically stated that
serious flooding in the mining area of
Yoganup in the first quarter of the year
would materially affect profits for the
year.
With the assurance that this flooding
will not occur again and the prospects
of both ilmenite and zircon looking
good, it seemed an excellent time to
come in. I purchased 2000 shares at
2s. lOd.
The last purchase for the week was
the 1000 Ansett’s notes at an average
price of 6s. 3d. The turbulence of the
Dubbo trip has shaken the Ansett
market, causing more than a few people
to bail out. If you’re an Ansett share-
holder you have to learn to live with
these political upheavals. Temporarily
I'm joining the group to find out
whether actions speak louder than words.
Transactions for the week were:

THE MAN
ON THE LAND
Breeding Better Cattle
Imported or local stock?
as long as anyone can remember
A it has been taken for granted that
to improve beef and dairy cattle you
must import stock from the British Isles.
Lately this theory has been questioned,
not by stud breeders so much, but by
scientists who believe that the quality of
Australia’s cattle could be vastly im-
proved by breeding from within.
Now is a good time to investigate this
theory, because for ten years imports of
live cattle have been prohibited because
of the fear of introduction of foot and
mouth and other diseases. As far as the
great majority of beef breeders are con-
cerned, the import ban is total and is
likely to remain so.
Breeders of dairy cattle, though, may
import certified disease-free semen for
breeding by artificial methods. This, at
the moment anyway, is largely an aca-
demic point, because of the difficulty of
getting certified semen. Nevertheless it
illustrates the difference in attitudes be-
tween the beef and the dairy breeders.
The “big three” in beef breeding are
the Shorthorn, Hereford and Angus
Societies. They are opposed to artificial
breeding whether the semen is obtained
from overseas or locally. Some of the
smaller beef societies, such as the Gal-
loway Society, are not against artificial
breeding and regard it as a logical
method of building up herd numbers.
This has resulted in a certain amount
of friction between the owners of the
newer breeds and the established breeders
of the “traditional” British breeds. Until
such time as imported semen is available
in any quantity, there is hardly a case to
be argued.
The breeders of the British Isles are
generally reluctant to export semen for
artificial breeding abroad because they
would prefer to have the buyers come to
their annual sales and bid up for live
cattle. They would like to see Australia
lift its import restrictions and argue that
improved veterinary facilities would safe-
guard the health of Australian herds.
Zealand has partially lifted her
restrictions and NZ buyers were
active in Britain earlier this year. New
Zealand is a competitor with Australia
in the export of beef, particularly to
Asia. It will be interesting to see
whether the renewed imports of stud
stock by NZ result in better quality
meat for export in two or three years’
time.
If New Zealand is able to produce
vastly improved cattle by renewing im-
ports from the British Isles, then there
may be moves here to follow suit. Until
that happens, however, the import restric-
tions are likely to remain in force.
Improvement therefore must come
from within. Can it?
One man who thinks so is Professor
John Francis, of Queensland Univers 1
“There is no great need to import cat
either British or tropical breeds,” he d
“While there are some outstanding c ]
overseas that would benefit our trop!
breeds, we have sufficient good J
to develop commercial stock suited,
the northern environment. Probably!
lot of Brahman and Santa Gertrij
breeders think differently. Yet the saa
applies to British breeds. It is not nel
sary to make importations.”
Professor Francis, who is professoij
preventive medicine at the Queensla
University’s faculty of Veterin
Science, has a supporter in Dr J. S,,
Barker, of the department of anil
husbandry, Sydney University. Speah
at the recent conference of the Austral
Society of Animal Production, he sj
“Renewed importation of cattle fj
overseas could well suppress the natu
ability of our cattle to adapt themsef
to conditions in Australia. There j
definite signs that our cattle herds lij
gradually been changing to adapt to j
climatic conditions. Animals whose t
cestry can be traced for a long timcf
Australia appear better equipped to sta
up to a hot climate, for instance, til
more recent imports.” ]
trouble with academic opinion
often, that it is some other bloj'
cattle that are under discussion,
schism between the academic and 1
“traditionalist” is an unfortunate fad
life, particularly in the case of t>
cattle.
Generally speaking, academic opin
favors artificial breeding and da
breeders point to remarkable imprt*
ment in herds over recent years thrn
the use of AB. If the stud beef breet
do not accept AB it is difficult to
how they are going to get real herd
provement. As they are (the major
anyway) against both AB and impil
the belief that what the beef breet ■
really want is a “closed shop” is grow
in academic circles.
The recent Melbourne Show ;
pointed this situation nicely. On
one hand, the beef breeders prov
evidence of progressive thinking
holding an informative beef sympos
and a progeny-test competition,
the other hand, the judging provi
evidence of the friction within the b?
breeding world.
The judges of the “big three” bre
came up with the usual
pleasure to judge”, “would hold t l
own anywhere in the world”, and so
But the newer breeds, Santa Gertru’
Murray Grey and Galloway, were d
gated to a ring which was off the m
arena and the judges’ comments w
hard.

%e academic sense all the judges’ com-

-a) There are two sides to this. It must
Always be remembered that breeding is

Traditional beef breeders do seem to be
Reaving themselves wide open to criti-
cism. This is the practice of foster-
mothering beef calves on dairy cows.
311 It is fairly widespread, particularly in
'the “big three” breeds. Many commer-
cial farmers have complained that in
buying foster-mothered bulls they are
Reaving too much to chance. The fat,
Tut on as a result of rich milk from the
a nairy cow, hides a wide range of faults.
4 Beef breeders justify this practice by
laying that it results in an animal of the
growth possible and therefore
Vindicates the maximum strength of con-
stitution. That is a bit like saying that
ba boy is of a strong constitution if he
grows fat on a diet of sweets and ice
cream.
One South Australian breeder entered
some young Shorthorn bulls at Mel-
bourne Show which had been reared in
the paddock on their own mothers.
Regrettably they came nowhere.
Nearly £1 million will be spent next
year by the Australian Cattle and Beef
Research Committee. This money comes
from the recently imposed slaughter levy.
It is a small levy compared with the
wool levy, but the principle is the same.
Executive head of the Cattle and Beef
Research Committee is Dr M. C. Frank-
lin, who has been seconded from the
CSIRO. The committee includes repre-
sentatives of the Australian Wool-
growers and Graziers’ Council, the Aus-
tralian Wool and Meat Producers’
Federation, the Department of Primary
Industry, the Australian Agricultural
Council, the CSIRO and the universities
engaged in beef research.

Blow to NSW Wheat-growers
Rejection of compensation for storage
n V[ew South Wales wheat - growers
3 r received a serious setback when
jthe Australian Wheat Growers’ Federa-
tion rejected a proposal for compensa-
tion to be paid to growers for wheat
I stored on farms, when the silos were
unable to receive it.
t Wheat-growing organisations in NSW
ehad been reasonably confident that the
(Federation would have realised the
i plight of its growers and made some
j recommendations to the Australian
; Wheat Board.
However, the Federation did make a
lame compromise by resolving to ask
jthe Wheat Board for supplies of fumi-
gants to be made available to farmers
Tor wheat stored in approved storages.
Delegates and observers from NSW
left the conference with a bitter taste
in their mouths and the feeling that they
had been “ganged up on” by South
Australia, Victoria and Western Aus-
tralia. Queensland was the only other
State that backed NSW in its proposal.
A previous meeting of the Federation
rejected a request for compensation of
3d. per bushel for wheat stored on the
farm for two months or over, when the
Grain Elevators Board was unable to
i receive it, and if delivered on demand
‘ n good condition.
The urgency of some form of relief
[ becomes more real as the harvest draws
i c |° ser. So, at the Federation meeting,
| P wheat-growers of NSW simply ask
ror the approval of the principle of
farm storage compensation without set-
ting a figure.
The shortsightedness of the other
States can be partly attributed to the
fact that their rate of expansion is no-
where near as fast as that of NSW and
Queensland. Last season was the first
time that Victoria had ever filled all
her available storage space to capacity.
NSW has been struggling for some years
to get enough storage built, but the
harvests just keep on expanding faster
than new silos can be erected.
Wheat production is now expanding
at such an alarming rate in NSW that
there is every likelihood that the esti-
mates of over 140 million bushels, pre-
viously described as presumptuous, may
well in fact become a reality. There is
every indication that the coming harvest
is going to break all previous records.
In the past five years the NSW harvest
has jumped from about 60 million bush-
els to an all-time record of 122 million
bushels last year. NSW and Queensland
grew nearly half of the total Australian
production between them.
With this mighty expansion, or better-
termed sudden explosion, in the harvest,
the construction of silos is fast being
left behind. Leading wheat - growing
organisations in NSW have been advo-
cating for months that farmers should
make some sort of storage available. It
was called short-term or “buffer” stor-
age, but with the current reports of a
record harvest and indefinite overseas
sales the length of time the producer
has to store it may be extended some-
what.

new Holden Station Sedan. Think of sparkling
performance that’s far and away smoother and
quieter, thanks to Holden engines’ seven-bearing
crankshafts and hydraulic valve lifters. Or a luxury
Red Carpet Ride that really irons out the bumps.
And then think of an absolute cavern of a load area
that just swallows up picnic baskets and beach
umbrellas and water skis . . . ana gives you more
