The Red Page
Strindberg
Died on May 14, of this year, aged 63, the
Swedish genius August Strindberg, the
greatest intelligence in Europe. To English
literature he has been little more than a
name: only now are his works, which num-
ber more than 50 volumes, beginning to
trickle through in translations. Available
already are a volume of plays, comprising
The Dream Play, The Link and the two
parts of The Dance of Death (Duckworth),
The Father, a play, and The Confession of
a Fool, an autobiographical novel. Strind-
berg was a bitter hater of womankind—in-
deed, a bitter hater of his race, the sternest
of realists, the most sinister of pessimists.
His works include historical plays, sex-pro-
blem dramas —at one time he had plays run-
ning simultaneously at six Parisian theatres
—five autobiographical novels, works on
chemistry and alchemy,, poems, volumes of
short stories dealing intimately and realisti-
cally with marriage, scores of pamphlets and
articles.
Born at Stockholm, Sweden, in 1849, the
son of a mesalliance between a Shipping
agent and a barmaid, Strindberg learnt
early the miseries of poverty. The two
parents, the seven children of the marriage,
and the two servants lived in two rooms,
and the family always appeared to the boy
like “a prison in which two prisoners
watched each other, a place where children
were tortured and maids brawled.” His
school life was equally unhappy, his early
struggles were chequered with failure.
Without the money to buy books or even
fuel, he had to relinquish his medical studies
at the University of Upsala, and return to
teach in the very school in Stockholm where
he had suffered as a pupil. In turns he was
a telegraph clerk, editor of an insurance
paper (for which he learnt the higher mathe-
matics), tutor, actor, daily journalist,
librarian (when in order to compile a cata-
logue he learnt the Chinese language). At
23 he wrote a five-act historical play—-a
complete failure that flung the man back
on doubts of his genius. At the age of 30,
however, his novel, The Red Room, a bitter
satire on society, brought him notoriety.
But he had married, at the age of 26, an
actress—and from this, the first of three
disastrous marriages, dates his bitter mis-
ogynism that was to dominate all his work.
Strindberg was always suspicious of any
attack upon his personal rights, and the
claim of the New Woman to possess rights
of her own he regarded with fanatical ap-
prehension. According to an article in a
recent Fortnightly :—
The typical Strindberg woman is a fiend
with the physique of a Madonna and the
soul of a vampire, who sucks dry the life-
blood of her heroic ’ victim. The typical
Strindberg man is a Samson shorn of his
strength, writhing in the toils of some Deli-
lah, protesting vociferously, and yet taking
a morbid delight in his own bondage.
His volume of short stories, entitled
Marriage, an orgie of the blackest pessim-
ism, deals realistically and with the deepest
seriousness with the problem of unhappy
marriage. The book was confiscated, and
criminal proceedings brought against the
publisher, on the charge that it spoke offen-
sively of rites held sacred by the estab-
lished religion of Sweden. This was but
a pretext; Strindberg, like Chidley, had
spoken too freely on questions of sex moral-
ity. The author took his publisher’s place
as defendant, and was acquitted. The
second part of Marriage appeared two years
later. Under the influence of Nietzsche his
attitude toward woman became an allegation,
not only of moral and mental, but of bio-
logical, inferiority. Even in his latest works
he holds that woman is an intermediary
form, standing betVeen the man and the
child —a view held by Weininger. About
this time
God, Heaven and Eternity had to be
thrown overboard if the ship was to be kept
afloat; and.it had to be kept afloat because
I was not a10ne....1 became an atheist as
a matter of duty and necessity.
Strindberg’s The Father has been hailed
as his greatest play. It has more condensed
gloom and horror to the square inch than
the whole of Ibsen. It shows a malignant
wife gradually driving her husband to in-
sanity. His most widely known play is
Miss Juliet, in which the eternal Strind-
berg duel of sex is intensified by the duel of
class. As one critic says:—
In the 50 pages of this play, with its
three characters of the woman, the butler
and the cook, which observes rigorously the
Aristotlian unities, every element of the
highest and gravest tragedy is introduced
with the most accurate and natural psy-
chology.
Another critic remarks that it embodied
some startling experiments in form, and has
undoubtedly exercised a distinct influence
on the subsequent development of dramtic
technique.
The Confession of a Fool lays bare the
tragedy of his first marriage. Strindberg
wrote it in French, and consented to its
publication only because the money was
absolutely necessary to him. This “phe-
nomenal piece of official sexual autobi-
ography,” it is said, successfully scandal-
ised the whole continent of Europe.
In comparison with this book, The New
Machiavelli is but the tamest Sunday school
reading, and the romantic confessions of
Mr. George Moore the merest healthy pranks
of robustious youth....lt stands out from
the whole of European literature as the
superlative masterpiece of suspicious love
and monstrous morbid hate.
Another great novel followed, By the
Open Sea. Then the tremendous creative
efforts of these years resulted in the inevit-
able mental breakdown. Literature no
longer appealed to him; he studied chemis-
try, and suffered from the most acute mania
of persecution. He wrote religious dramas,
and his mad Dream Play; he dreamed of
proving the transmutability of the elements.
Though not ever actually insane, he had to
retire to a private sanatorium. But he
recovered. In 1887 he started writing again,
and with a new spirit that startled those
who had held him lost for ever.
Then followed 10 years of production so
amazing that it surpassed his previous high-
water mark both in quality and quantity.
....More and more as he pushes on from
one height to another, he manages to fuse
the two offices of artist and moralist without
injury to either of them. His view of life is
still pessimistic, but back of man’s earthly
disappointments find humiliations and suffer-
ings he glimpses a higher existence to which
this one serves merely as a preparation....
In the closing line of his last play, he pleads
for mercy as one who has suffered more, than
most “from the inability to be that which
we will to be.”
Among his many activities of this period
must be mentioned the theatre he built for
the staging of none but his own plays. There
he experimented in the simplification and
standardising of scenery, until at last some
of his plays were given with no other acces-
sories than draperies. In these last 10 years
he wrote 29 dramatic works.
His life ended in quiet and peace, the old
man, surrounded by his children, of whom
there were five from his three unhappy mar-
riages, hearing only the, echoes of the storms
still raging about him, devoted to music,
fond of flowers. And his fame is constantly
growing; his name is mentioned with those
of Ibsen and Bjornson. Indeed, Ibsen pro-
phesied that Strindberg would be greater
than he.
The volume of Plays, translated by Edwin
Bjorkman (Duckworth), has a useful bio-
graphical notice, from which some of the
facts above recorded are taken, and a chron-
ological list of Strindberg’s chief works.
The dramatist explains that in The Dream
Play he has tried to imitate the discon-
nected but seemingly logical form of the
dream. Anything may happen; everything
is possible and probable. Time and space do
not exist. The characters split, double,
multiply, vanish, solidify, blur, clarify. But
one consciousness reigns above them all —
that of the dreamer; and before it there are
no secrets, no incongruities, no scruples, no
laws. The prologue takes place in the
clouds, where the daughter of Indra goes
down to visit the earth. The play begins*
in a fantastic scene, with a discussion be-
tween the daughter of Indra and a glazier.
And the scene changes again and again all
through the play, each time to something
more fantastic. There are lawyers, actresses,
officers, bill-posters, ballet-girls ; and each is
changed into somebody else. The daughter
marries the lawyer in order, to experiefice
Hell. And her refrain runs through this
weird play, “Men are to be pitied.” Strind-
berg has marvellously succeeded in convey-
ing the grotesqueness of a dream.
The Link, a one-act tragedy, is more sub-
stantial stuff. The link is the child that
binds together the father and mother who
have arranged to be divorced. They decide
'before the trial not to accuse each other in
order that the court may not take away
from them both their child. They have
mutually agreed that the mother should
bring it up on certain conditions. But
during the trial they lose control of their
tempers, and give vent to damning accusa-
tions of guilt. The Tesult is that the child is
taken from both. In the bitter fight between
them there has been only one loser—the
child. (The psychology of this pitiable
quarrel is wonderfully indicated. When the
baroness asks her husband if he thinks she
had ever loved him, he replies:—
“Yes, once, at least. When I had been
faithless to you. Then your love grew
sublime. And your pretended scorn made
you irresistible. But my error caused you
to respect me, too. Whether it was the male
or the criminal you admired most, I don’t
know, but I believe it was both —it must
have been both, for you are the most typical
woman I have ever met There is room
in me for both love and hatred, and while
I love you one minute, I hate you the nekt.
And just now I hate you!”
The Baroness asks: “Are you thinking
of the,child also?”
The Baron replies: “Yes, now and al-
ways! And do you know why? Because
our love has taken flesh. He is the memory
of _ our beautiful hours, the link that
unites our souls, the common ground
where we must ever meet without wishing
to do so. , And that is why we shall never be
able to part, even if our separation be -e-
dared ' Oh if I could only hate you as I
want to ’
4 j A , i hain-htc! mn+nni
And the end reaches the heights oi mutual
bitterness. YVhen the mother says that she
will that night shelter in the pastor s barn, to
whose house the child has been taken by order
of the court, so that she might sleep near
her child, the father retorts: “You hope to
sleep to-night—you?”
&
Ihe Dance . of Death shows again the
misery of an ill-matched pair. In the first
part the husband has made himself so hate-
ful to the wife that when he is seized with
an apoplectic stroke she exults at the end of
her long misery. But, as always, lie dis-
nnnmnte w He revives ind the first Dart
appoints her. lie revives, and me nrst part
ends with the husbands cynical deeis o to
celebrate their silver -wedding. And into
this mbnage has been dragged a decent man,
Curt, whom the evil of both husband and
wife, their eternal hate and malignancy,
drags down to evil, too.
The second part shows us a new husband,
, „ win,' ziootiv
born again after his close fight with death
a \ampire engaged in sucking the blood
from everyone with whom he comes into
contact. The daughter of these parents and
the son of Curt continue the sex duel, the
utter ruin of Curt is methodically arranged
by the vampire husband, and the one gleam
of hope comes when the daughter wakes to
the knowledge that S he Mvcs the ruined
man s son. And the husband is at last
finally stricken down, and, in his helpless-
ness, the malignant wife takes her revenge
for her life-time of slavery.
Alice : At last that tongue is checked!
Can brag no more, lie no more, wound no
more ! You, Curt, who believe in God, give
Him thanks on my behalf. Thank Him for
my liberation from the tower, from the wolf,
from the vampire. (With her face close to
her husband’s.) YVhere is your own strength
now? Tell me? Where is your energy?
(The husband, speechless, spits in her face.)
Oh, you can still squirt venom, you viper—
then I’l tear the tongue out of your throat!
(Cuffs him on the ear.) The head is off,
but still it blushes.! (Pulls his beard.)
Think only that justice exists on the earth!
Sometimes I dreamed it, but I could never
believe it. Curt, ask God to pardon me for
misjudging Him. Oh, there is justice!
And the last words of this dreadful man
are: “Forgive them, for they know not
what they do!” And the wife admits:—
While we have been talking here, the
image of him as he was in his younger years
has come back to me—l have seen him, I
see lum—now, as when he was only 20—1
must have loved that man!
Curt: And hated him!'
Alice : And hated!—peace be with him !
A terrible play. And this is the sort of
drama that is hailed as proper for the stage
by the leaders of European thought! In
what an idyllic back-water do we live in
rustic Australia!
vr ,.,. , . . „ ,
Much industry and a minimum of method
have gone to the making of In Praise of
Australia, an anthology in prose and verse,
by Florence Gay (Constable 55.). In her
proem the compiler apologises too much. “I
remember to my sorrow that I was pledged
to weave my garland of thornless roses.
Stirred by some tragic picture recalling the
fiery breath and arid deserts of a drought-
stricken continent—a veritable vision of dry
bones—the masterpiece had, perforce, to be
cast by, lest my readers should complain of
threnody in place of psean.” Well, she
needn’t have worried ; Australia can stand
the plain truth—-that, for instance, it is not
a drought-stricken continent; and her ex-
cuses and omissions are more damning to the
foreign reader than the evidence procurable
could ever be. The selection of extracts is
done on the most haphazard method. An
indication of the value assigned to her
selected authors is given by the number of
times each is quoted. Thus, Carl Lumholtz
has 20 extracts, Ada Cambridge 15; from
her own works the compiler deems 13 ex-
tracts necessary, A. F. Calvert gets 12, and
A. W. Howitt, Gilbert Parker and N. W.
Thomas 11 each. Then comes Boldrewood,
Poster Fraser ( !), Professor Gregory, the
Rev. C. H. S. Matthews and J. E./Tennyson
\\ oods m that order. An indication of the
author s sense of proportion is that she puts
i oster J raser and C. E. W. Bean on the
same page and on the same subject. I lor-
ence Gay may be pardoned for the eagerness
With which she gives space to her own work,
but not for the choice of extracts on histori-
cal subjects that have been superceded by
later writers.
If there is anybody who still wants to
read Ruskin, Everett’s Library (7d.) can
supply her with Sesame and Lilies, and three
other of his works at the same price ( per
George Robertson), cloth binding—a marvel
of cheapness.
The New Sex
Gertrude Atherton’s heroines abound in
brain ceils. Julia France (Murray, per
Sydney Book Club) is a superwoman de-
stined for greatness, who becomes a leader
of the suffragettes, and after the usual Ather-
tonian conflict between her brain cells and
her femaleness, decides to take the man and
let the suffrage go. She is married off as
an innocent girl to a rake, the heir presump-
tive to a dukedom. The duke marries and
begets an heir, and Julia’s husband goes
mad. When his confinement leaves her
free, after years of agony, she joins the
suffragettes, and becomes one of their cap-
tains. Gertrude Atherton believes in these
women who bite live policemen in order to
get a vote; but out here, where women got
the right of entry to a polling booth without
the painful necessity of having to bite even
a curate, the disproportion between the
means and the end seems absurdly large.
To the Australian woman the vote is of as
little importance as it is to the Australian
man. Of course Englishwomen should have
the suffrage; it will do them no harm —nor
anybody else —judging by the Australasian
result. But the chapters in which the author
analyses the psychology of the suffragette
are of great value. She sees in this raging,
suffraging woman a new sex—“women that
are approaching closer and closer to that
exact balance of masculine and feminine at-
tributes which, when attained, will give
them the one perfect happiness, setting them
free, as it must, from the present curse of
the race, the longing for completion.”
“The one perfect destiny seemed to her to
be an utter independence of soul and body
and mind, the power to cultivate every
faculty toward a state of development in
which one human being, having in perfect
balance the highest potencies of both sexes,
should stand alone, indifferent to all extrin-
sic aid. And this perfect balance could be
attained only by woman, unhampered as she
was by the animality of man.”
“The suffragettes,” says one character,
“are like no other women under the sun—-
nor any sun that has ever shone. They’ve a
new group of brain cells, and something new
and big is coming out of it.... They’ve got the
same look those old leader-martyrs had vrhen
chained up to the stake and waiting for the
faggot. The same grim, patient mouths, the
same clairvoyant eyes, as if looking straight
at the unborn millions liberated by the
martyrdom of the few. Their enthusiasm is
cold—and eternal. They are as deliberate
as death. There are no better brains in the
w0r1d....1n short, they’re a new force let
loose into the world ; and the geese outside
put them down as hysterical females.”
And to Julia: “They did not look like
women at all. They looked pure brain, sex-
less, selfless, ruthless... .Truly a new force
unleashed. Were these the immortal
women?”
Fortunately this new sex, though complete
in itself, is sterile. But Julia was also a
female—-she couldn’t help being female with
her gorgeous hair. There is a Californian
knight who slays the dragon of sexlessness
that guards her soul.
“And he kissed her.
“ ‘You can kiss me again,” said Julia,
after a moment or two.
“‘I thought so.’ And he kissed her for
several minutes.
“ ‘You look quite different,’ murmured
Julia, finallv.”
So, despite Gertrude Atherton, we may
consider Julia finally lost to the suffragette
cause. There is no case on record of any
other man wanting to kiss a suffragette for
several minutes.

Recent shilling Methuen reprints include
John Boyes, King of the Wa-kikuyu, by
himself, and A Little of Everything, an
anthology from the writings of E. V. Lucas.
Richard Delian’s Between Two Thieves
(Heinemann—copies from. Dymock’s Lib-
rary and George Robertson, Sydney). —700
pages of rapid romance and hustled history,
interspersed with realistic pictures of war-
fare and valiant exposures of the social con-
ditions of the Victorian era —-will .while
away a lazy fortnight. The story is too
tremendous for detailed description; it com-
passes the long life of its romantic hero;
the stage is crowded with characters his-
torical or plain; and the style is a patch-
work of imitation Dickens, Meredith, Car-
lyle and Anthony Hope. The author wished
apparently to expose the machinations of
the British army contractor, and took for
her scene the Crimean war; she also wanted
to paint an idealised portrait of Florence
Nightingale and to show the horrors of
army life in the England of those days. On
top of this she placed her gorgeous French
hero, involved him in a grotesque Zenda ad-
venture, gave him a realistically described
liaison, and won him back to the heights of
altruism by his love for Florence Nightin-
gale. The book is one splendid splurge,
lurid, inchoate—a patched tapestry in the
making of which there is much cleverness,
and a lavishness that is not art but the
overflow of the excessive vitality of the
author. From this book and The Dop Doc-
tor it seems .possible to “place” Richard
Dehan as a popular novelist, the probable
successor —on, of course, a higher plane—of
Miss Corelli.

has an immediate effect in stimulating
the activity of the brain and promoting
additional keenness and increased vigor
to the whole mental system, thereby
ensuring the brain-worker against future
breakdown.
A Wea Ith of Health to Everyone
To everyone whose health is not as it should
be —to those suffering from Anaemia, Sleep-
lessness, Weakness, Brainfag, Lowered
Vitality, Exhaustion, Nerve Troubles, or who
are merely “rundown”—'“Wincarnis” offers a
wealth of renewed health and a progressive
upbuilding of vitality and vigor that will
make the whole system pulsate with new
life. Over 10,000 doctors recommend
“Wincarnis.” Will you try just one bottle?

if plain) face will, combined, give you
an advantage socially over your pretty-
faced but scrawny friends.
It is the refreshing firmness
and delightful fulness of the
feminine form that captivates,
and it is the woman who is
most correctly developed who
monopolises the endearments of the op-
posite sex.
By following our advice, thousands of
weak, thin, run-down, anaemic women,

complaints, that make women miserable.

Helsingfors.
White and pure by the Northern Sea in the
Arctic day it lies,
Fairer far than St. Petersburg, and greater
in Finnish eyes ;
By snow-drift and floe-drift where the dis-
tant bergs are grand,
And the ice blink and the northern light.
like a frozen fairyland ;
And still they cleave to the Swedish church,
the Norseman of the Norse,
In, not a collection of greasy huts —but the
city of Helsingfoi's.
Big and blonde, and with flaxen hair, and a
grin for his downs and ups,
And a womanish seeming alfection, unknown
to an Englishman, in his cups,
Was Oscar the Russian Finn,
who came to dcse lands to dwell,
And he’d brought his widdered old varder
with him, and his words began with
V e-ell.
Dusty and hot, and the sweat that rained
from their foreheads made ’em blink,
Two strong teams wrought in a tug-of-war
in the Darlinghurst Skating Rink;
One was British, and we were there to pull
for the South like sin,
But the foremost man in the foreign team
was Oscar Ackmann, the Finn.
Ere the word was given, a blooming Swede
stood up in a front-rank chair,
And, “Pull for all Finland, Oscar,” he cried,
“for your father’s sitting there!”
“Turn him out! Sit down ! ! You're drunk,
yer blank !” the gallery yelled as one, _
And the big Swede slumped in his chair
again—but Sweden’s work was done.
We hauled and we heaved like five men
each, but Oscar hove like ten,
And a Forest Devil of largest size was the
thing we needed then.
For a bundle of whiskers in front row chaii>
—as rough as the mountain gorse —
Was yelling, in Finnish, “Pull, Oscar!
Pull! for the honor of Helsingfors.”
The old man howled till his old voice broke.
and the cracked voice rose to a scream,
In desperation, “Bool! Oscar ! Bool! Dere’s
a Russ, in der English team!”
’Twas a damned Finn lie! but we couldn’t
speak—it was played low-down on us —
We pulled for Australia and England, too,
but Oscar wanted the “Russ.”
Well —oA r er we went —he’d have got us all —
and that’s how we lost the day—
As someone explained to our ignorance as
we wiped the sweat away.
But we shouted for Oscar till he shed tears
—’twas a most un-Enalish fuss —
We even treated the old man, too, while
cursing his phantom “Russ.”
The Irish praise was unprintable, and the
Scottish a Language Test —
And the Welshman spoke in his native
tongue, so of course we gave him best.
Said Britain : “Bai Jove” : said the Bush :
“My oath!” and Sydney spoke with a
vim:
“It’s no use pullin' a Blanky Bloke when his
old ’un pulls for him!”
How often and often in peace and war —
how often by board and bed—-
Do the spirits of our dead parents pull—
the absent and the dead !
I don’t infer that they’d raise a Russ —at
least not in the realms above.
(Though I think that the shade of a love
would lie for the sake of a living love.)
My father’s picture hangs on the wall, and
his father-in-law’s as well.
One was a Bushman, and one a Norse from
the seaport of Arundel.
They were true men: —true, on the tracks
they came, whether by land or sea.
And I sometimes trust, in the Worst of times,
that one of them pulls for me.
White and cold by the frozen sea, in the
Arctic night it lies.
Fairer far than St. Petersburg, and greater
in Finnish eyes.
By snow-drift and floe-drift, where the dis-
tant bergs are grand.
And the ice blink and the northern lights,
like a frozen fairyland.
She cleaves to her ancient customs still, and
thrives on her frozen shores,
With her still, white lights in the Winter
nights—the city of Helingsfors.
HENRY LAWSON.
A Touch of Autumn.
There is a touch of Autumn in the air,
And on the lawn the silver sheen of frost;
The sun, a little later, finds us where
We lie and dream of Summer —who is lost;
She slipped away—we did not see her go,
But merely noticed that she wasn’t there;
Then on a sunless beach someone said, “Joe,
There is a touch of Autumn in the air.”
The evening sea is grey. The tailor’s ad.
Is shouting “Winter!” in unwilling ears,
And telling us we must he w'St-Aily clad.
(This ere poor Autumn on the scene ap-
pears !)
Quite well she knows swift Summer will
come back
To say farewell some twenty times or so ;
Reluctant as a star to take the track,
It nearly breaks her warm young heart to
go.
We go no longer for the morning swim;
Our bathing suits a banquet make for
moths;
The evenings, too, are bleak and rather dim,
And on the beach the unshot breaker
froths.
We light the lamp for tea and gently shun
The draught that seems to come from
Scott’s South Pole;
The heat is over, and the cold’s begun :
I must ring up for half a ton of coal.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking
some care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; tile official always is.

THE FINANCES OF THE N.S.W.
MINISTRY.
The N.S.W. Government has reached the
end of the third month of the present finan-
cial year, and has also about reached the end
of its third year of office. It can’t be said
that its Ministerial reputation improves as
it grows older. It started well, but, so far
as can be judged by the evidence, it couldn’t
stand prosperity, and it promises to end
very badly. Its finish is likely to be that of
the person with a bad conscience, who sees
horrible visions on his death-bed. Appar-
ently it has settled down to a conviction
that, so long as an Administration calls it-
self “Labor,” it can be more bigoted, more
extravagant, more utterly regardless of politi-
cal decencies, more recklessly indifferent to
its alleged political principles, more Tory, and
more of a backslider than any of its Conser-
vative predecessors. The number of its
alleged axioms that the McGowen Ministry
has gone back upon is something “over the
limit.” It was pledged to reduction of bor-
rowing, and it has borrowed more madly
than the maddest of those who went before
it. It was also pledged to snend loan money
onlv on works that would pay full interest
and sinking fund, and it has been as blankly
indifferent to the payable or non-payable
character of its works as any Ministry could
be. It was supposed to have ideas re de-
centralisation, yet it nlayed the game of
congestion, in the interests of the private
landlords of Sydney, as shamelessly as any
of its forerunners. It believed, theoretically,
in the State ownership of land, yet, when the
chance came to it to create new State-owned
cities, at ports where new cities are urgently
needed, its belief in the State ownership of
land was, seemingly, as purely theoretical as
its belief in many other things. It was,
nominally, hostile to monopoly, but it fought
in the interests of the Sydney landlord mon-
opolist all the time. It even tried to give
the landlord —including the absentee land-
lord —special exemptions and advantages
under its Income Tax Act. Its policy in-
cluded the abolition of the State Governor,
but it didn’t attempt to abolish him. In-
stead, the Premier addressed him in terms
of fulsome eulogy, and expressed a hdpe that
he would long continue, and, meanwhile, his
Government made war on the Federal Gov-
ernor-General, which was no nart of its
contract. The McGowen combination was
pledged to the abolition of the State Upper
House, yet it made no move whatever in that
direction. It was supposed to be avainst
the wretched Tory device of Party Govern-
ment, yet no Cabinet ever stood by Party
Government more enthusiastically. It has
been anti-Australian and anti-Federal all
the time, and it is no part of its mission
to be anti-Australian or anti-Federal. It
showed itself a hungry seeker after office
when it broke the agreement made with
Speaker Willis for an early dissolution of
Parliament. _lt was supposed to stand for
absolute political cleanliness —cleanliness
not only in fact but in appearance. Yet a
time came when it had. an angry and unman-
ageable supporter on its bands, and it sent
him away, with about £2B a week for “ex-
penses,” plus his Parliamentary salary, to
report on turnips, or irrigation, or some-
thing almost equally indefinite.
In short, the present N.S.W. Government
appears to have convinced itself that, so
long as it calls itself “Labor” it may do
almost anything with impunity. It doesn’t
matter how many Labor principles or ideals
it throws overboard, provided it sticks to
the name. Most of its members, judged by
their deeds, are small, narrow-minded paro-
chialists, who have no more sympathy with
the big ideals of the party than have
Gregory Wade or Bruce Smith. They
follow their own limited views, and take no
account of the national policy which
they are supposed to represent. It looks as
if they lacked even the largeness of vision
which would show them that they are out of
step. Perhaps they can’t realise that it is
possible for them to be out of step so long
as they stick to the name. They are sugges-
tive of the Polish Republic, which bad no-
thing republican about it except the title.
As already mentioned (before this tale
began to digress so extensively), the present
N.S.W. Government has reached the end of
the first quarter of the financial year. Also,
apparently, .it has very nearly reached a
financial crisis. Although there are some
theories concerning economy in the party
programme, the McGowen. combination has
been an affair of heroic expenditure. As
late as the year which ended at June, 1907,
N.S.W. was paying out money (revenue
money and loan money) at the rate of
£13,000,000 or £14,000,000 per annum.
Now it is spending at the rate of about
£27,000,000 per annum, and the increase is
too sudden. The public income has gone
up, but it hasn’t risen to correspond with
the outgoings. During the past three
months (July-September, 1912) the revenue
was £148,654 more than for the corresponding
period of 1911, while the expenditure in-
creased by £625,293. The ordinary expendi-
ture for the quarter was £1,072,836 ahead of
the revenue, so a deficit is being piled up at
the rate of over £4,000,000 per annum.
That is a magnificent sort of business, and
it is hardly possible for it to go on long
without a breakage of some sort. The
State can’t increase its customs and excise
revenues, for these things are not under its
control. It can’t increase its land revenue,
unless it goes back to the nefarious habit of
jobbing away the freehold of the public
estate; or unless it breaks away from the
old congestion policy and the old subser-
vience to the Sydney landlords, and starts to
establish State-owned cities at the good
deep-water ports which are now neglected
and deserted. It can’t force up the railway
and tramway returns by any sudden and
violent process. In fact, though the revenue
from the railways and tramways for the
July-September quarter of 1912 was £66,557
more than for the corresponding quarter of
1911, expenses were rushed up by £288,362.
So the net receipts showed a decline of
£221,775, and, despite all the loan expendi-
ture on new works, affairs were on the down-
grade. There are only two visible ways out
of the difficulty. One is to meet the deficit
out of loans, and trust to Providence. The
other is to increase taxation. Yet, if the
deficit goes on at the rate of the last three
months, it would be necessary to multiply
the State taxes threefold in order to fll
the gap. And a community which finds its
taxes increased threefold all in one act is
liable to become angry, and to throw things
about.
* * * *
There remains to be considered the beauti-
ful and wonderful loan expenditure. This
comes under two headings—expenditure out
of loans already raised, and expenditure out
of money temporarily borrowed from trust
funds, and to be repaid later on, when loans
become available. The expenditure out of
loans already raised, for the July-September
quarter of 1912, diminished by £15,398, as
compared with that of the corresponding
quarter of last year. It did this because
money is so hard to find, even at an increased
rate of interest. The expenditure of money
temporarily borrowed from the trust funds,
and to be replaced when loans can be raised,
increased by £510,432. The actual loan
money spent for the quarter was £1.842.131,
which means that the cash of Coiien is
being poured out at the rate of over
£7,200,000 per annum. In the bad, wicked,
extravagant days of Toryism, before the
reforming and economising Labor Govern-
ment came into office, the loan outlay once,
but only once, got nearly up to £5,000.000
in a year —the year when the Government
resumed the plague-stricken section of Syd-
ney. At other times, between £2,000.000
and £3.000.000 was a fairly steady figure.
Joey Carruthers got the amount down, in
his last year of office, to a shade over
£1,000,000. Looking at these. figures, The
Bulletin sometimes feels inclined to apolo-
gise to Carruthers —even to Carruthers —
for some of the things it said about him.
Compared with McGowen he was a good
Democrat, and compared with him
McGowen is a bitter Tory, and a miserable
slave-monger. The person who is least like
a real Democrat is the one who sells the
community to the usurer, and in that respect
Premier McGowen is the worst sample
that N.S.W. has possessed up to date.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Another Result of 20 Per Cent.
Protection.
Customs Minister Tudor, as well as other
Laborites, got a further warning of trouble
ahead when, last week, the largest match
factory in Australia, situate in his electorate
of Yarra, closed down, and 400 employees
were thrown idle. This factory, a new and
most up-to-date affair, with special dining-
rooms for the convenience of the employees,
and a miniature garden and lawns for their
delectation, was built but a few years ago,
and cost, with plant, etc., £150,000. It has
paid fair wages, as things go—from £2 10s.
to £3 10s. to men, and from £1 to £2 to girls.
It made wooden matches, as well as wax, at
first; and though the earlier lots turned out
were of poor quality, they speedily im-
proved, and of late have been as good as, if
not better than, the imported. But —that
£150,000 worth of splendid brick buildings
and intricate machinery cost a good deal more
when in its place in Church-street, Rich-
mond, than it would if erected in the Cold
Land; consequently, there is a larger sum to
be earned annually to pay interest on outlay
and make up for depreciation. Also, the
wages of the employees—2os. to 70s. per
week—are somewhat higher than the 7s. and
Bs. per week paid in the Cold Country. But
the Australian match-makers had to sell their
goods at no higher price than the imported—
3s. 6d. per gross for wax, 2s. 6d. per gross for
wooden matches, wholesale —and they found
they couldn’t do it. So they first quit mak-
ing wooden lights : now they have shut down
altogether. Their expenses on plant, main-
tenance, etc., were higher than in England;
their raw material cost more, and the wages
they paid were three or four times as large ;
so, naturally, presuming that Australia
wanted its own matches, and was capable of
making them, they expected Protection
against the foreigner. They got it! Listen!!
‘’Matches and vestas of all kinds, in boxes
of 100 or less, Is. per gross of boxes, 6d. per
gross if manufactured in the United King-
dom.” Sixpence per gross, equal to 20 per
cent, on wooden, 14 per cent, on wax
matches! Just here a sidelight on Austra-
lia’s preferential tariff glimmers across the
scene, so to speak. Most people have noticed
that of late the words “Made in Sweden,”
which used to appear on most of the boxes of
wooden matches —and they are the most used
here—have disappeared, to be replaced by
the words, “Manufactured in England.” It
is a typical trade dodge, but the blessed con-
traptions are turned out in the Tandstickor-
fabrik, Nordkopings, or elsewhere, just the
same. Then they are sent to England to be
labelled, thereby getting into Australia under
a customs duty of 6d. per gross instead of
Is. But whether the pipe lights are made in
England or Sweden or Vienna or Japan
matters little ; they are not made in Austra-
lia. You cannot pay interest and mainten-
ance expenses 50 per cent, higher, and a
wages bill 300 per cent, larger than the for-
eigner does, on a 20 per cent, tariff. So 400
persons are thrown out of work, and £150.000
worth of machinery and buildings stand idle.
v
A Franchise Matter.
At the time of writing, it looks as though
the Greater Sydney Convention Bill is des-
tined to be thrown under the table, or cast
into the dustbin, or otherwise discarded.
The Legislative Council has jibbed at the
wideness of the franchise that is proposed
under the Bill. The opinion of “Liberal-
ism” on this question was tersely voiced by
the S. M. Herald, as follows: —
The Legislative Council was justified in taking the
view, which it did by an overwhelming majority,
that the persons who should elect the members of
the convention should be those primarily interested
in municipal government.
It is doubtful if the Convention would have
done the Greater Sydney movement any ser-
vice had it materialised. It would have
been composed, inevitably, of persons of the
suburban alderman breed —loquacious drap-
erlings, hustling little grocers, and other
citizens with the maximum of push, and the
minimum of imagination and civic know-
ledge. It is likewise doubtful if the Govern-
ment ever seriously intended that the Con-
vention should be established, just as it is
questionable whether it is any more enthu-
siastic, at heart, in the matter of a Greater
Sydney than any of its predecessors in
office. So no great calamity will have
occurred if this particular sop is withdrawn
from the watchdog of city unification. The
circumstance which clamors loudest for hos-
tile comment is the Tory attitude on the
franchise question which appears, as above-
mentioned, to have slain the Bill. A consid-
eration of the duties that must be under-
taken by a Greater Sydney Council goes to
show that all classes in the city, and not
merely a privileged few, are vitally con-
cerned in every step leading up to the for-
mation of it; just as all classes will be con-
cerned in the business of electing it later
on. Sydney’s civic parliamentarians must
do far more, when the present herd of small
municipalities is wiped out and the whole
control of the bloated harbor-side city is
handed over to the one central body, than
peer casually into untended gutters; worry
about the spilling of tram-tickets on the
streets, and attend to such-like trivialities.
Taking a line by the rest of the world’s mg
progressive cities the council will shortly
after its establishment find itself in control
of the entire gas and water supply, in addi-
tion to the electric supply which it attends
to at present. It will run the metropolitan
tramways, and construct and administer an
underground tram or railway system. It
will probably instal, and run, its own tele-
phone service. It will take over the Art
Galleries, libraries and museums, erect
baths and washhouses broadcast, and con-
duct them on up to date lines. It will build
a harbor bridge, and attend to the tremen-
dous development that will follow automa-
tically on the North Shore. In due course,
it will follow Glasgow’s excellent example
and institute a civic Public Health De-
partment. Also, it will put the chronically
insolvent and ineffective metropolitan hos-
pitals on a business basis; build model
lodging houses of a sort suited to the cli-
mate ; and erect meat, fruit, vegetable and
other markets after the style of the admir-
able fish markets that are now in the hands
of the council. Incidentally, it will continue
the present campaign in the cause of city
beautification and improvement, and street-
widening ; and it will settle down to cope
with such a rotten road problem as has not
faced any band of City Fathers, outside the
remoter parts of places like Korea and
Senegambia, for half a century. It is plain
lunacy to argue that the folks who have to
attend to concerns of this magnitude must
be responsible only to a comparative hand-
ful of property-owners. In the natural
order of things they are going to have a
province to look after. It takes a N. S.
Wales Liberal to contend that persons with
such responsibilities should be elected on
parish lines. •

Main Roads —and Votes.
The Country Roads Bill, which Premier
Watt has just laid before the Vic. Assem-
blv. with a glad smile to his country sup-
porters, is, in effect, little more than a
sop to that insatiable animal, the land-
owner. Briefly, it provides for the appoint-
ment of a Road Board of three —a chair-
man, at £BOO a year, and two assistants, at
£6OO each, none of whom is to engage in
any other employment-—to carry out such
surveys and investigations as may be neces-
sary ; to ascertain what shall be main roads,
what material is available and what may be
the best method of construction ; obtain infor-
mation from municipalities; purchase plant
and materials, and make roads or get them
made by the local councils. The Board is to
oe appointed for five years, and during that
time it may bust up £4,000,000 ! It is sup-
posed to spend £400.000 a year on construc-
tion, and a similar sum on maintenance; but
if it spends a trine less one year it may blew
so much more the next. Of this, the muni-
cipal councils are to find half where it was
formerly their duty to find the whole,
though they never did it. The coin, of
course, is to be borrowed, by the issue of
stock or debentures, and the sponsor of the
Bill, Lands Minister McKenzie, estimates
that an additional 2d. or so on the rates
will bring in some £70,000 a year, enough
to pay the municipalities’ half-share of in-
terest and sinking fund. Which is cutting
it fine with a vengeance! .The provision
that the local bodies shall pay half will
doubtless prove mere hypocrisy and sham in
the end. Country local bodies in Victoria
are shameless log-rollers, shameless repudi-
ators, and shameless bankrupts. Probably
they will meet a, quarter of their liabilities,
and then demand further grants. The horse-
leech’s daughter was a country land-owner
in Victoria —at. Kyabrara for preference.
She owned a big area of land, and raised
cows and didn’t pay her water rates'.
What Parliament Has to Put Up With.
Any old idiocy is good enough for Parlia-
ment. If the allegedly enlightened;; modern
democracy doesn’t state that paradox in
so many words it habitually does; so by im-
plication. It has never risen in scandalised
annoyance and demanded the. abolition of
the Party Government system. Yet this is
a grotesquely unbusiness-like way of con-
ducting the affairs of a State. If anyone
came before the directors of, say, the
Hordebn firm with the proposition that this
concern should be run on such lines, he
would be firmly ejected from their presence
as a lunatic. In no successful private ven-
ture in the world’s history have the prin-
cipals been accustomed to take vacations of
tremendous length, and in the intervals work
little by day and much by night, with occa-
sional spells of hard labor lasting well past
the small hours of the morning. Parlia-
ment never works in any other way than
this, and the democracy gives the insane
practice the approving endorsement of
silence, if nothing else. And then there is
that other imbecile old convention, which no
Parliament is ever without, and which no
public-spirited citizen lias so far attempted
to shoot or poison or dynamite, or even kick,
namely, the legislative wag. The more dis-
reputable and ill-mannered a political party
is ; the lower the general level of its mentality
becomes; and the less inclined the public
grows to take it seriously, the more of this
variety of nuisance it tends to develop.
That is an axiom, the truth of which has
been established often, not only here and in
the United Kingdom, but in the French
Deputies, in the German Reichstag and else-
where. The N. S. Wales Assembly is abso-
lutely teeming with obstructive funny men.
There is nothing of the rapier about their
humor. It is almost entirely a matter of
crude insults, joyously projected at all and
sundry—the wit of the pushite, bowdler-
ised to a certain extent owing to the exig-
encies of Parliamentary procedure. Occa-
sionally it isn’t even bowdlerised, and then
the wag goes out on his ear, mayhap, and
the press talks next morning as though
a brutal outrage had been done on

from the dailies of the last day or so, indi-
cate the futile, not to say criminal, way in
which the community’s time is squandered
by its law-making low comedians: —
The Minister for Works: I beg to move that the
question be now put.
Mr. Fitzpatrick: You pro-Boer! Pro-Boer! You
ought to be taken out and shot!
The Speaker: The honorable member for Orange
has made use of an expression that is offensive to
the Minister for Works. I call upon him to with-
draw and apologise—the hon. member for Orange.
Mr. Fitzpatrick: To what expression do you take
exception, Mr. Speaker.
The Speaker : That the hon. member ought to be
taken out and shot.
Mr. Fitzpatrick : I withdraw, Mr. Speaker; it
was merely
Opposition Members: Apologise, Fitz!
The Speaker: Unless the hon. member withdraws
and apologises without any reservation, I shall have
him removed when the House has divided.
Mr. Fitzpatrick: Oh, yes, have me removed.
Other Hon. Members : Put us all out.
The Speaker: Order! The hon. member for Middle
Harbor—-the hon. member for Gloucester —the hon.
member for Petersham —are all disorderly.

when I was removed. I had a lunatic to deal with,
said Mr. Wood. .
Mr Griffith protested that it was most improper
to refer to the Speaker of the Assembly in that way.
“I said I had a lunatic to deal with,” said Mr.
Wood. “If you choose 1 to fit it on him you can.”
Also, some more :
Mr. Fitzpatrick’s methods again brought him
under the Speaker’s notice, until finally he (the
Speaker) said: “If the hon. member doesn’t address
himself seriously to the question I’ll have him re-
moved.”
Mr. Levy here laughed.
“Also the hon. member for Darlinghurst is out of
order,” said the Speaker severely to Mr. Levy.
“Oh, you can .” Mr. Fitzpatrick was about
to say something, but threw down his papers on the
table in disgust.
The Speaker called the Sergeant-at-Arms to remove
Mr. Fitzpatrick.
That hon. member, with some heated remarks,
went out as the Sergeant approached.
It would be a simple matter to fill
a couple of pages with these tragic
imbecilities. If Fitzpatrick isn’t ask-
ing questions about counter-lunches, or
Cohen isn’t inquiring archly into the
Speaker’s ancestry, it is in most cases be-
cause Onslow is blithering about the pos-
sibility of someone “tearing down” the
Union Jack and “spurning it underfoot,”
or because one of the other accredited jest-
ers of the Wade party is being convulsing
on some other lines. People who hold up
the State’s railway business by heaping
obstructions on the lines are punished. It
would be unsafe to so interfere with the
engineer of a ferry steamer as to hamper him
in his job. Broadly speaking, no one may
deliberately place obstacles in the way of
anyone who is following a legitimate calling.
Always excepting, of course, those who are
trying to do the things in Parliament that
they have been commissioned by the electors
to do. Them, any cheap, practical joker is
at liberty to obstruct; and the purveyor of
gutter gibes and backyard abuse has a
charter as wide as the State to air his gifts
to their detriment. It is almost as prejudi-
cial to the conduct of business as the Party
Government system, and it is as senseless
as the mace. In a really thoughtful and
practical-minded community all such mani-
festations would be treated like notifiable
diseases.
More Encouragement for the
Monopolist.
As a result of the High Court judgment,
last week, in the interminable old Sugar
case, one of two undesirable things is bound
to happen. Either (1) the Commission will
be withdrawn and the public will never
know whether the Sugar Co. was an altru-
istic body or a commercial brigand, or (2)
the Commission will pursue its labors, and,
by so doing, produce a world’s record in
the way of litigation. The Sugar Co.
claimed that the Royal Commissions Act
was invalid; alternatively it argued that, in
any case, the Commission had no right to
put certain questions to the directors of the
Co. The Court has found that the Act is
valid, but- that a huge class of questions is
inadmissible under it. No questions may be
asked in the first place, concerning “the in-
ternal management of the affairs of the
company.” This, of course, is another
manifestation of the bizarre work of Aus-
tralia’s demented old acquaintance, the
Trade and Commerce clause. It was de-
cided in Huddart Parker and Co. v. More-
head that the Commonwealth has no power
to touch the internal affairs of any
trading corporation once the same has been
established. For the rest, the co. need not
answer any questions, put by the Commis-
sion, concerning:—
(1) Its operations outside of the Commonwealth
except as they relate to the conditions of carry-
ing on the sugar industry irrespective of the persons
by whom it is carried on; (2) matters relating to the
value of particular parts of its property, except such
parts as are actually employed in, the manufacture
and production of sugar within the Commonwealth;
(3) details of salaries paid to its officers, except as
far as they are relevant to the actual cost of pro-
duction and manufacture.
The point where the opulent Sugar Co.,
which has plenty of funds to fee lawyers,
scores lies in the fact that no one is
entitled to decide, in the last resort, as to
what questions are, and what are not, rele-
vant, but the High Court. The probable
procedure will be that the directors will
appear before the Commission; refuse to
answer the first query that strikes them as
awkward;' submit to be fined ; and then
appeal to the High Court for a prohibi-
tion. After the expenditure of a stupendous
amount of time and money, the Court will
give a decision one way or another, and the
next long act of the wearisome old farce
or Chinese opera will begin. Meanwhile
(unless the Sugar Co. is, as a certain sec-
tion claims, an unusual philanthropist
which battles like a tiger to have his good
deeds kept dark), the public will continue
to pay too much for its sugar, and for all
those articles into the composition whereof
'sugar enters. _ It strikes this paper as a
scandalous thing that a matter of the above
description should have been settled by a
casting vote of the Court. As Justice
Isaacs remarked:—
* .They (the Judges) were asked to determine the
rights, of parties as they would be in events which
had hot yet arisen, which might never arise, which
depended on reason and the discretion of Royal Com-
missioners themselves.
Ip .his temperamental bias against all demo-
cratic legislation, Chief Justice Griffith
has jumped, so to speak, about three miles
before reaching the fence. Justice Higgins
aptly describes the suit as “an extraordin-
ary device to elicit the opinion of the Court
by anticipation.” This was a case, if ever
there was one, in which the Chief Justice
might have said: “I sL. 1 decline to inter-
fere at the present stage. I will not usurp
the function of another branch of the Gov-
ernment, but will wait and see what ques-
tions are put by the Commission, and what
bearing they have on one another, and on
the law as it stands.” C.J. Griffith didn’t
take that reasonable course, seemingly,
because his mind is so cast as to render him
incapable of seeing the case for Australia,
as against any private corporation, big or
small.

The Honesty of the Daily Press.
“Lex” on the above large subject:—
The smug assumption of uprightness which char-
acterises Sydney’s two morning sheets has induced
a large section in N. S. Wales to credit them with
an honesty which is not theirs. This, and the facts
that (1) the world—and more especially the world
which takes Liberalism seriously—is largely com-
posed of fools, and (2) that the sheets in question
perpetrate their dishonesties warily and with a cer-
tain skill. Two excellent examples of a tendency
which is painfully common were afforded last week.
The Sydney Telegraph (4/10/’l2) wrote concern-
ing- “the Federal Government and the Vend case.”
It gave Attorney-General Hughes particular Hades.
The point taken was that Hughes, trickster that he
was, intended to use the vend fiasco for purely politi-
cal purposes, i.e., to assist him. in the coming Re-
ferendum campaign. Why doesn’t he appeal against
the High Court’s verdict? Wailed the Telegraph:—
“The answer is that the people are to be trickily
asked to grant something else under the name of
power to legislate for the suppression of trusts and
combines that amount to deliberate conspiracies
against the public interest. Such an appeal would
be grossly disingenuous and misleading.” Etc., etc.”
Now, in the very interview with Hughes on
which this attack was based it was clearly stated
that the Government did intend to appeal. The
Telegraph left that part out of its report (both
the Melbourne morning papers printed it, by the
way), and relied on being able to inflame its readers
against the dastardly Laborites, by virtue of the
said readers’ congenital dulness, and readiness to
take wild charges for granted.
The following day the Herald wrote on the
“Powers of Royal Commissions.” A most significant
feature of the High Court’s judgment in the Sugar
case was the fact of its being not a majority judg-
ment, but a decision arrived at by means of the
C.J.’s casting vote —which is as different as chalk
is from dynamite. Yet, here is the way the Herald
discussed the matter: —
“In the sugar industry Commission case, on which
judgment was given yesterday, the High Court de-
cided, by majority, that the Commission had ex-
ceeded its powers.”
The general public will never know that while
Griffith, and Barton held that the Commission had
exceeded its powers, Isaacs and Higgins thought
directly opposite. For the general public is an ass.
And in that fact lies the local dailies’ greatest
strength and influence.
The Wowser by the Sea.
The mixed bathing question burns fiercely
at South Melbourne and thereabouts, and the
Victorian State Labor party is spraying the
conflagration with kerosene. The Albert
Park branch of the P.L.C. censured a couple
of South Melbourne councillors for having
voted for a restriction of mixed washing
facilities in the open, whereupon one of the
censured parties stated that, although he
had previously advocated the mingling of the
sexes in the sea, “members of the Labor
party” had been some of the shocked resi-
dents “who requested him to assist in the
endeavor to minimise the Evils carried on
along the beach.” But the councillor who
voiced the indignation of Mrs. Grundy
weakened his defence by going into details.
He spoke of one summer night last season
when there were “as many as 30,000 people
along the beach. A complaint was made by
a respectable citizen who had been bathing
with his wife that two whites and a half-
caste had behaved in a most degrading man-
ner.” Now, in a 30,000 multitude of bathers
there are bound to be a few uncommonly
loose, lots as well as an immense majority of
Public Opinionists, and when Public Opinion
is shocked it can always cure its cause of
complaint without restricting its sphere of
action. The incident of three naked persons
inviting censure in the middle of a crowded
thoroughfare wouldn’t call for the closing of
the street. Public Opinion would chase the
nuisance away, if a policeman was not avail-
able, and would be on the alert to prevent
recurrence of the Evil. It might even run
a tram-car over the nuisance. The majority,
like Truth, is mighty and must prevail, if
there is any fight in it. Mixed bathing at
South Melbourne or anywhere else is just as
decent as the average morality insists on
making it. If the indecent members of a
30,000 crowd sort themselves out and
assemble and meet together to practise an
average immorality on their own it is up to
the police to raid their meeting and run
them in, damp and unashamed. Official re-
striction of the hours of mixed bathing on
the plea that it is calculated to “bring a
blush to the cheek of the most hardened sin-
ner,” and contaminate “the sacred character
of any man’s daughter” any time outside of
certain hours, is an illogical reflection on the
moral force of Public Opinion which has a
physical police force behind it. To abbre-
viate,. in the alleged interests of Decency,
the time when a lot of decent people want
liberty to mixed-bathe is an absurdly un-
reasonable thing to do. Practically it is a
concession made by vote-seeking councillors
to their narrow or nasty minded constitu-
ents who object to mixed bathing because
their godfathers and godmothers would have
rather died than go bobbing up and down in
the sea together. A few aggressive Labor-
ites of the South Melbourne district have
chosen to regard it as a new political griev-
ance, or a municipal insult to the Party, or
what not, but as a matter of fact the trail
of the Wowser is over it all. And the Wow-
ser is found in all political parties, like
sciatica, dandruff or corns. He is found
alike in the Trades Hall and the Employers’
Union. Indeed, wl en they are both scream-
ing against the iniquity of wage-earning on
the Day of Rest the politics of the Wowser
and the Laborite are identical.
Dens of Mystery and Imagination.
“Hashisch-Eater” writes: —
What a futile person is the Rev. Yarrington, of
Sydney. When Chief Secretary Flowers offered to
give him unlimited assistance to rescue white girls
and women from opium dens, by making it
impossible for them to find dens to get
rescued from, the Rev. Yappington declined,
on the ground that, if he turned informer,
he would have to give up being a missioner, and
would be unable to save any more women and girls.
The fact that there would be no fresh cases to save
didn’t appeal to Flappington a scrap. Saving them
is his business, and, presumably, to wipe out the
dens would be to take his job away, as without dens
there could be no job. It was a pretty poor case,
but Yarrington hadn’t sense enough to let it alone,
and get out of the muddle as unobtrusively as pos-
sible. He wanted to create an effect —every parson
being at heart a stage-strutter. He apparently had
no available dens to show, although he alleged he had
rescued white women and girls from them. So
he took a reporter round with him, although
a plain-clothes policeman would have been a
better ally. But the expedition was a failure. The
cleric showed no opium smokers toiling to verify his
statements; neither did he produce even one Flossie
with a dreamy eye and a far-off expression. He
merely wandered round some malodorous streets, and
introduced the reporter to some beldames who said
the locality reeked of opium sometimes. Apparently
Yappington felt he had been a failure, for he took
the pressman out yet a second time, put hirii in the
way of buying, through a woman, a bob’s worth of
opium, and drove him to drink in a low-down pub.
Unfortunately, the reporter forgot to say if the
reverend excursionist took a slight sensation himself
■ —-that would have been an interesting item.
Then Yappington remarked sagely that as he had
shown women could buy opium, it was only reason-
able to suppose they smoked it. Yet any fool can
buy castor oil, but it doesn’t follow he smokes it.
With that cracked deduction the Rev. Flappington
closed his case.
Did the Rev. Claptrappington ever see a woman
in a Sydney opium den? An opium den is a place
to which any recognised member of the community
of smokers can go and be supplied with parapher-
nalia and drug. A moment’s reflection will convince
anyone that such a place cannot be a deep, dark
secret, or it would get no custom. It is like a pub.
It must be known to be profitable. And if it is to
pay it must appeal to two classes—-people whose
normal surroundings are too respectable to permit
them to smoke opium in their own homes, and people
whose lives are spent in hotels and board and lodg-
ing houses, and who would not be permitted to
smoke on the premises. There is nothing difficult
about opium smoking; and it can be done in the
sanctity of the home much more comfortably than
it can in the den. So the habitues of the den must
belong to the two classes mentioned. And if the
drifting population can find the den, then the police
cannot remain in ignorance very long unless they
wish to. That degraded white women live in the
Chinese quarters is a matter of common knowledge,
but it was not opium smoking that took them there.
The inference of the Yarrington circular is that
white girls go to the dens to smoke, and being taken
advantage of in their helplessness while under the
influence of the pipe, sink gradually into a state of
concubinage with their destroyers. The truth is
quite the reverse. Utter demoralisation precedes the
arival of the white female at the Chinese quarter,
and opium smoking is a trifle to her other iniquities.
It is not till the system has become accustomed to
the opium fumes through consorting with a Chow
who smokes in his own home, that any white woman
becomes a votary of the pipe; and, anyhow, the
Chinese do not encourage their white companions to
smoke. It is quite unnecessary, and destroys their
usefulness. The appeal of the Rev. Yarrington for
funds with which to rescue white girls from opium
dens is a sort of business that has always been a good
coin-getter, and is used on a gigantic scale in the
United States. But it is like the raising of sub-
scriptions for the conversion of the Jews. No Jew
worth having is ever converted; but the subscrip-
tions go on —have gone on for years.
A sudden idea strikes me just here. Why not
sort of combine the two movements, and take up a
subscription, to be spent in the rescue of Chinese
women from Hebrew opium dens ; or start a mission
to induce Jewesses to pledge themselves not to use
the poppy weed, and to put down the sale of opium
in pawnshops? I don’t suppose any opium is sold
in pawnshops, but I am prepared to take on the
mission at a fair salary, and devote the rest of my
life to it.

For the first three months of this financial
year Australia’s Customs revenue shows an
increase of £416,860 over the first quarter
of last year—£4,024,078 as against
£3,607,218. Yet Prime Minister Fisher in
his budget speech estimated a decrease for
the year of £199,199. Evidently Fisher
overlooked what the framers of the present
tariff missed —that the higher the wages in
Australia the less the effective Protection
here against countries where wages have
remained stationary, or have only risen
slightly. Thus, the 35 and 30 per cent.
ad val. on boots that was fairly protective
when wages were 455. per male adult
loses much of its effect when a Wages
Board tells the boot manufacturer he must
pay 545., as happened in Victoria. That
is where a permanent Tariff Board would
come in. There would be no re-opening of
the whole tariff question with miles of
weariful speechifying. The Board would
get information from factories’ inspectors,
have a word or two with boot manufac-
turers’ representatives and boot-emplovees’
dittoes, note what the public was paying
for the imported articles, and fix the tariff
accordingly. Also, it could quickly vary
the tariff as the conditions varied.
♦
“Harrison O.” writes, using his heart’s
blood as ink :
Is Tariff Reform ever coming? During the past
twelve months 126 applications have been made
for revision of Australia’s present well-nigh useless
duty schedule, and Frank Tudor cannot get into his
office without stumbling over a deputation. He
always asks the latter the same question, viz.: “If
we give the manufacturers increased Protection, what
are the workers going to get?” In the first place, the
workers will get work. In the second place, they
will be in a position to demand increased wages,
which, in many cases, they cannot do now, without
the danger of crippling to such an extent the in-
dustry in which they are employed as to cause them
to lose their jobs altogether. The manufacturer
cannot fairly be asked to increase wages when he is
not selling his goods; for the simple reason that
goods of a similar class are being purchased from
the foreign sweater and brought into this country.
Returns for the first six months of this year show
that, for the first time since Federation, imports
are in excess of exports. In 1010 the value of this
country’s exports exceeded :i(s imports by over
fourteen million pounds, but this year (up to the
end of June) exports amount to £34,831,541, while
imports have reached to the astounding value of
£37,689,580. This represents money paid to the
foreign sweater. Various deputations that have
waited on the Minister for Customs during the last
few months have quoted figures in relation to the
particular industries which the deputationists repre-
sented. Take, for instance, the boot and shoe in-
dustry ; or, rather, what might be an industry under
proper fiscal conditions. During the first seven
months of this year, £75,002 worth of footware was
imported into Watt’s State alone, as compared to
£46,270 for the corresponding period last year.
Among the requests for increased Protection was one
made by both employers and employees connected
with the straw hat industry. In 1911, straw lids
to the value of £87,511 were imported from the
Cold Country, to say nothing of large quantities from
Italy and elsewhere. Instances of this kind could
b«i quoted ad infinitum, to Show the ineffectiveness
of the present tariff; which is not a Protectionist,
but a revenue tariff. The Federal Budget assumes
a continuance of a £14,000,000 income from the
tariff. No scientific Protectionist tariff would yield
anything like £2 16s. per head of the population.
It looks as if one of the reasons why-the present
Government is opposed to tariff revision is. that it
fears a decrease of revenue. In'the meantime, the
foreign non-unionist is gettirig wages that should be
going into the pockets of the Australian unionist;
and the Australian manufacturer is being allowed
to suffer for the benefit of the distant foreign
sweater. The Australian Labor Government, which
has affirmed the desirability of preference to union-
ists by refusing adequately to protect the products
of the local unionist, is giving what virtually
amounts to preference to foreign non-unionists.
The Leader That Was Pushed.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The People’s Liberal party has now pledged itself
to fight for Protection with all its heart and soul.
It proclaimed its resolve, and Mr. Deakin got out.
The Duke of Plaza Toro did much the same thing.
—Melbourne Age.
Once on a time a general whose name is
handed down
To the present generation as a name of
high renown—
Once on a time this general—l trust you
understand
This happened years and years ago, and in
a foreign land.
This general once stood before his army,
thinking hard;
And he talked about advancing, but he
didn’t move a yard,
For, to put the matter plainly, though he
knew his cause was right,
And desired to be the leader, yet he didn’t
want to fight.
He bravely talked for hours and hours of
tactics and defence —■
(In good sooth, he was a leader of un-
doubted eloquence) —
Till his soldiers grew impatient, for they
spied afar the foe,
So they started marching forward, and the
leader had to go,
Though he begged for time to elocute, they
forced him to a walk ;
Then they broke into a double, and he
hadn’t breath to talk.
If his soldiers start to push him—well,
what can a leader do?
Thus he led his army forward —of necessity,
’tis true.
Oh, they forced him to a run,
And the firing of a gun
Gave him qualms about the business, but
he couldn’t change his mind.
He’d have dearly loved to pause
And orate about The Cause,
But he had to keep responding to the pres-
sure from behind.
Then he yelled a battle-cry,
And he waved his sword on high,
But he mournfully reflected as he viewed
the foemen’s horde;
Leadership may be all right
While the foe is out of sight,
But, like the pen, the silver tongue is safer
than the sivord.
The fight was won. That general, his heart
swelled up with pride,
Delivered speeches eloquent to his victori-
ous side;
And his peroration hinted they should rest
while they’d the chance;
But the army wanted more of it and urged
him to advance.
’Twas here the general resigned to join an-
other band
That didn’t yearn to go and fight the battles
of the land.
’Twas a calm, reposeful army, and that
leader suited well;
For it let him talk of fighting while it sat
and took a spell.
He was leader of the tired,
And he never was required
To go ranging o’er the country to attack a
savage foe;
And whene’er he thought it best
To sit down and take a rest,
Well — it’s rude to push a leader when he
doesn’t want to go.
And, if by some mischance,
He should mention an advance,
They would let him talk about it and ap-
plaud him very hard;
They would hail him as the man
Who by right was in the van;
But they’d grab him by the coat-tails if he
sought to move a yard.
Give attention now, my masters, to this
general’s career ;
He was affable and eloquent, but let me
mention here
This happened very long since—twenty
thousand ■ years or so ;
For now, we know, a leader leads before
he’s forced to go.
But if, perchance, at any time, a leader you
should find
Who objects to moving onward till he gets
a push behind.
Far better shift him from the front; his
place' is never here;
And let him join the other crowd —the
Army of the Rear.
Let us have a moving army, let its leader
be a man
Who doesn’t need a shove behind to keep
him in the van ;
And if he halts to elocute, let’s shift him
off the track,
And put him ’mid the baggage-carts and
lumber at the back.
There to seek a reputation with the busted
and the bushed;
For no man may seek for honor who insists
on being pushed.
And he who seeks to lead must keep ahead
a yard or so,
For —-it’s rude to push a leader when he
doesn’t want to go.
For a leader of the lcind
Who requires a kick behind
Isn’t any sort of leader, when non come to
think of it;
And the generals we need
Are the fellows who can lead —
The men who know the track to go, and
tackle it with grit.
Wherefore, when you hear the talk
Of these fellows who would balk,
While they flood the land with eloquence
till mentally you’re bushed.
Just remember, words and air
Seldom lead to anywhere,
And reflect upon the story of the leader
that was pushed.

Concerning an amateur outfit: —
“the Importance of Being Earnest” was acted
twicp last week, in Sydney, by a capable lot of
amateurs. The writer did not notice any ageing mem-
ber of the audience shedding the furtive tear that
bespeaks the aching heart. Yet there must have
been some imaginative ones to whom this production
brought sadness —the vague yet acute depression that
the woman of 35 or so when, amid the
lumber.of some remote garret, she lights unexpectedly
upon’ one of the hideous straw hats in which she
bicycled in younger, happier days. “Charley’s
Aunt,” “Our Boys,” and so on, produce no such
effect, for they belong to any old epoch. Wilde’s
comedy is racy of his brief period—a period when
a certain type of London young man was accustomed
to denounce his foes fiercely as “horrid,” and acclaim
his;friends as “quite charming”; to worship a bowl
of roses in what his idol, the Master, would term
“a luxuriously appointed apartment” ; to dress half
a dozen times a day; and to well-nigh burst in the
effort to be whimsical and scintillating. They are
gone, these bizarre lads —gone like the snows of
vester-year and velocipedes and Queen Victoria and
dreps-improvers. Last week they and their associ-
ates lived again for a bttle while, and the return
from the tomb was a thing of interest and in places
an artistic triumph.
“The Importance of Being Earnest” is one of
those plays which amateurs of the right sort do better
than many professionals. The mere idea of the
finest of amateur combinations in “Hamlet” (say)
or even “The Face at the Window” is displeasing,
not to say intolerable. But the adramatic quality
of this particular Wilde comedy is right into the
amateur’s hands. There is no fevered action to tempt
them to fall crashing over their own feet. The
i nsensational environment is one to which they are
accustomed. No harm is done if self-consciousness
causes them to underolay a trifle. Staginess of voice
and diction —fatal in such a play—are not among
the offences to which they are liable. They have a
dozen or more natural assets which help them to
produce the needed atmosphere. Which probably had
a good deal to do with the success of last week’s
Charity show. Mrs. Langloh Want was a most nat-
ural and restrained Lady Bracknell —a character
which the writer has, in his time, had the misfor-
tune to see represented as the conventional stage
mother of title: i.e.. as a species of well-tailored
low corned an. Miss Dorothy Luscombe (Gwendoline
i'airfax) and Miss Ruth Lumsdaine (Cecily Cardew)
shone refulgently as often as they appeared. They
wore just the fair, well-bred, humorous, glittering
and utterly inexplicable maidens whom Wilde de-
lighted to portray. Captain Burnham was hardly
lady-like enough as Worthing. He allowed himself
an occasional virile shout or howl, which would
have scandalised the aesthete of 20 years ago. But,
take him for all in all. he performed in workmanlike
style. Captain Curwen (Algernon) was less explo-
sive, and to that extent more convincing. All the
leading' characters dressed according to the last
shriek of the fashion of the moment. A daring
anachronism something analogous to clothing the
wrecked mariners of “The Tempest” in modern
yachting suits.

This paper viewed the Great McEwen in
his lair at Sydney Town Hall, last week, on
the night it (the paper, not the hall) went
to press. Hence the tardy notice of his
show. To those who delight to see their
fellow-humans publicly debased, and to those
who rejoice at the spectacle of the popu-
lace plunged in what is mostly known as
“innocent merriment,” the labors of McEwen
will appeal., vastly. He gets a dozen or
more Qi.tizeps on the platform, and at a.
\yord ffbfty him they immediately behave
like members of the N. S. Wales Opposition.
The majority of the onlookers are diverted
thereby to the verge of hysterics. Through-
out the exhibition the writer was oppressed
by grief at such ruthless martyrdom of
man’s self-respect, and likewise by carking
doubts as to the genuineness of the hypno-
tism. Speaking in the jargon of the drama,
the subjects seem to over-act. Their
antics, their facial convulsions, their wild
leapings all call for drastic sub-editing if
they are to carry conviction to corpus P”t
a bright thought occurs : Perhaps McEwen
has no time or use for carpers, and merely
lays himself out to convulse Hie multitude.
If that is his aim the man who decries his
show is either blind and deaf or a liar and
a malignant knave.

“The Chocolate Soldier” is to be fired to-
morrow night, as the result of a court-
martial presided over by Generalissimo and
Chief Corporal Hugh Ward, in the unavoid-
able.absence of Honorary Sentry-box J. C.
Williamson. The vacant stage allotment at
Her Majesty’s (Svdney) will be filled on
Saturday by “Dorothy,” who will be charmed
to reintroduce Lurcher and other provincials

That astonishing female, “The Girl from
Wayback.” will retire from Sydney Palace
on Friday evening, in order to make way
for Magician Jansen, who opens a two weeks’
season on Saturday. This is a good time
of the year for a magician, thoimh a
might be better. The person who thinks of
backing a horse for the Cup badly wants
some wonder-worker to show him how to do
the deed to advantage. At the same time,
the thing may be overdone. The reason why
the Israeli fish Cup is no longer run at
Jezreel is that the old prophets foretold the
winner too regularly, and Pekah found the
market forestalled.
“The Woman,” the great graft drama
which begins cheerfully at a telephone
switchboard, and ends in heartbreak and
hysterics, is still harrowing the feelings of
people who attend Sydney Royal. The
moral of the play is still under considera-
tion. One idea that may be deduced from
it is that, if you acquire and hide away a
family skeleton when you are young, ir will
surely find you out in later years, should you
become of sufficient public interest to make
your family remnant worth investigating.
Therefore, it may be best to take the bones
out of the cupboard early, and walk down
the street arm-in-arm with them, and intro-
duce them to your friends, and get the busi-
ness over. Another device is to hang the
scattered framework by the heels from the
outer battlement of your office, • with a
placard attached: “This is My Skeleton;
Come and Look at it.” In that way you
also get it over. Many a man Ims Oear°d
the way to greatness by shovelling the family
ghost into the street in good time, and getting
the business over.

Eight Hours Day in Sydney didn’t do the
city picture shows any harm, and before
eight o’clock each of the J. D. Williams
theatres was packed. The chief attractions
at the Crystal Palace were “The Black Cat,”
an Apache-cim-love yarn of much tonnage,
and “Williams’s Weekly,” wherein the Ep-
som and Derby were re-run for the benefit of
those who were at' the motor gymkhana,
while the motor show was re-shown to those
who were at the races. The second edi-
tion of the Palace was also crowded, and
the automatic machines worked overtime to
keep up with the rush. At the Colonial
“Nellie the Lion Tamer” proved that lions
are easier to tame than men. In the
“annexe” at the Crystal Palace a trick swim-
ming competition is proving very refreshing
when the thermometer is at SO.
“The Queen of the Redskins” is to be
treated similarly to the vice-regal Denmans,
and has been given notice to quit her Sydney
residence, the Adelphi, to-morrow night. On
Saturday “The Girl Who Took the Wrong
Turning” (supposed to be identical with
“The Girl Who Got Off the Wrong Side of
the Tram”) will explain just how it hap-
pened. Ethel Buckley will make her re-
appearance. possibly as she who went round

The “Get-Rich-Quick” audiences at Syd-
ney Criterion are mainly masculine. Get-
ting rich quick is a masculine job. That is
why there are no female bookies.
As surmised in this column some months
back, the Williamsonian idea of a new
theatre in Adelaide uas mt been carried
out. The land was bought—on North Ter-
race, opposite the railway station—and the
plans were prepared; but the venture
stopped there. It would have meant cut-
throat competition with the Royal, and now
it is announced that Williamson has
acquired a lease of the Royal from next
year. Other managers are to get any spare
dates at that house, much as they do at
present. The other theatres hmr>g ell ci(-her
variety or pictures, the little Royal will
continue to have its monopoly of drama;
though there is still talk, as,, there has been
any time for years past, <>C someone being
bold enough to build a larger opposition
house. The existing one, under the rule of
Wybert Reeve, and then Pollock, and, lat-
terly, the Pollock-Myers combination, has
done good service to the drama. Meanwhile
the strenuous Mclntosh has descended on
Adelaide to inspect his new purchase, the
Tivoli, and has instructed Marcus—who
continues his job as local manager, as for
so many years under Rickards—to pretty
well rebuild it, at a cost of some thousands.
It is to continue the variety business, but
the old, unnecessary First Part is to be
dropped.
Adelaide King’s has a strong bill, with the
real Chinese Peehillis, Vousden (back again
after long absence with his Irish ventrilo-
quism), Curran (who shows how one can
be not only athletic but graceful after losing
a leg), and two silent comedians, Phil and
Phlora (she is good, and he is a bit more
than that). Also, the Corrick family and
the Brennans are coming in. The Royal is
running a second week with “The Sins of
Society”—Hugh Buckler, Violet Paget and
co. _ It is melodrama, but not of the
“tripe” order. Bather it is Drrrv F
drama, and the Derby-week crowd has been
rushing it- At the Tivoli are Burns and
Bentley dancing: and another Bentley
(Thomas) being Pecksniff and Svdney Car-
ton and other people, out of) Dickens ; and
Borneo Gardiner whistling- like several
birds; also, the Keltons continue to maC'
music like angels n.e.i.. and Walker and
Sturne do things incredible yet funny with
tennis-racquets. West’s Pictures are star-
ring the historical romance of Murat and
the kingdom that he held for £1 bit and lost
in hysterics. Wondergraph and the Empire
both have a remarkable film of a burning
shin and a cargo of loose lions. It is worth
seeing twice because when a cargo of lions
is loose the result is worse than when a
cargo of poets is tight.
It is some time since a drama so
frail in plot and so starved in incident as
“Sweet County; Kerry” has eventuated at
Melbourne Princess’s. There was sufficient
incident in “The Wearing of the Green” to
make that harmless, unnecessary impertin-
ence bearable; but songs, dances, the manu-
facture of horseshoes, and the presence of a
large quantity of Jive stock on the stage do
little to mitigate 'the monotony of the present
calamity. The vacuous and vaporous first
act, in which the mild young village black-
smith takes the best part of half an hour in
asking for the hand of swate Norah, deserves
to be burnt by the common or monotonous

his usual lines ; that is to say, he makes him
like a young sdftgoods clea-K with a iuo,e

than he sings, which must! not be regarded
as reckless praise. This paper will refrain
from making the uncomplimentary observa-
tions it could make in regard to several
other performers, and will content itself
with a word of praise for Miss Edna Keeley.
The lady’s American brogue or Irish twang
is by no means displeasing, and she is very
charming as Dan’s mavourneen acushla ma-
chree, or words to that effect. The plav
is fairly well staged, except for the violently
green grass, which makes it impossible for
one to take the Drews’ farm seriously. On
Saturday next “Molly Bawn” is to be ex-
ploited at the Princess’s.
Children need have no hesitation in taking
their parents to view the story of "The
Extension Table,” which was delicately nar-
rated at West’s, Melbourne, last week. A
more improving fable this journal has never
studied; in fact, the yarn’s plain plea for
the sanctity of the ’ome and the frequency
of babies recommends it as a tract for circu-
lation among the Best People. “Vengeance
is Mine” was the title of a. yarn crowded
with German realism and domestic details.
In one part of the film a lady photographer
suddenly weds, and, at a judicious interval,
passes through a period of some embarrass-
ment. Happy to relate, when this report
closed, both were doing well.

A lion got loose on the screen at the
P’ran Lyric (Vic.) last week, and the yens
that greeted its debut almost drowned the
sweet strains from "the superb Lyric or-
chestra.” The animal was apparently the
instrument of one Moreno in wreaking his
dull and dreary vengeance on a party called
Fuentes, and before the beast was laid out
with Mauser bullets in its innards it had
nearly sacked the Fuentes household and
given the family a devil of a fright. As a
mixture of bellowdrama and wild animal
“business” the film was not bad, and the
cleverness with which the lion carried out
the plot of Moreno argues a degree of braini-
ness that makes it a Willie Kelly among its
kind. Another tale towards which this
paper adopts a reverent attitude was
“Broncho Billy’s Gratitude,” wherein
Broncho is weaned from evil courses by the
usual, persuasive friendship of the usual,
clinging child.
The label of “Last Nights” has’been laid
athwart the shining armor of “Ben Hur
at Melbourne Royal. Its preponderance of
piety over sport disqualifies that queerly
composite drama for running further than
October IS. By the time that Melbourne
has drained the bitterness of another Caul-
field Cup the bill is to be changed to “The
Whip.” and the rowdy machinery of the
Roman chariot race will serve to fake the
result of the Two Thousand Guineas con-
test on Newmarket Heath. Persons desirous
of knowing how lepers were cleansed of
yore are herewith exhorted to hurry up to
the Royal ere “Ben Ilur” passes out. The
Bulletin has failed irreligiously to get the
true hang of the miracle ip the last act, but
the lepers get cleansed, anyhow.

“On Our Selection” is now in the middle
of its seven-weeks’ season at Melbourne
King’s, and the rush to the booking office
and the pay boxes abateth not. A dozen
reasons, more or less, have been suggested
to explain the vogue of this loose-limbed
farcical-drama, yet nobody seems to have
remarked its glorious lack of industrial pur-
suits. Work is often talked about as some-
thing that happens in the neighborhood
when weather permits, also Kate goes away
for a time to earn her living in Brisbane.
But the prevailing spirit of the Selection
is one of indifference to the Labor Cause.
Even Dad, when he announces his deter-
mination to start again, gives no inkling of
his agricultural and dairying plans for the
future. Uncle Rudd, though described on

Apart from Miss Jessie Stuart, a “vocal
comedienne” of inconspicuous ability who
hardly justifies her importation to this
country, all the turns at Melbourne Opera
House are more than a week old. The best
of the performers just now are silent peonle,
whose actions speak louder than words.
Minnie Ivaufmann’s eloquent acrobatics on
her normal bicycle and on her long-backed
ditto seem to shout a challenge to all the
other lady cyclists in the profesh. And the
wonderful work of the Schenks speaks for
itself: The Schenks must have started at a
very early age to put their heads together.
Ten years ago when they were first intro-
duced to Australia as “Willie and Charlie”
(having been booked by Rickards four years
previously), they were head balancers for
the most part, and they used to ascend and
descend a steep incline with their domes of
intellect in close touch. Since when they
have so developed their equilibristic powers
and strength in general that there is nothing
left for them to do but to form one continu-
ous perpendicular Schenk with their finger
tips.

McMahons Repertory Co. concluded their
season last week with one consecutive per-
formance of St. John Hankin’s comedy,
. The Return .of the Prodigal.” The Prod.,
in this modern parable, is the hopeless bur
harmless younger son of a pushing commer-
cial -gent named Jackson. He was born
tired and non-acquisitive, whereas his bro-
ther Samuel is loaded to the muzzle with
business energy and push. When the Prodi-
gal returns to his British parental abode
from Australia, after doing in the £lOOO
with which he had been expected to so and
lose himself, he proposes that he shall hence-
forth eat the bread of idleness on an allow-
ance of £s.a week, or be a glaring disgrace
to the family. Brother Samuel advises the
old man to shell out and keep the family’s
respectability” undefiled. The cheerful
young waster regards his allowance as an
unwilling tribute from his relatives’ snob-

bery, j: but the sneer seems rather hoggish,
anyhdw. On the other hand, Samuel is
quite humanly correct in terming his bro-
ther a blackmailer. Hankin’s comedy,
smartly but not brilliantly dialogued, pre-
sents a number of conventional characters
under conditions orthodox and otherwise.
And fr was interesting, in spite of the dismal
waits'rbetween acts, and the sombre tone of
what* should; have been a bright perform-
ance. The prodigal son (F. K. Norris)
took himself too seriously, and his stodgy
conception of the character clouded the
humor of the principal scenes. Further-
more, the young lady who played Stella was,
in a.polite, way of speaking, too nervous to
do herself justice—not to mention the neces-
sity for doing justice to the part allotted
her.
Wirths’ circus is coming to Melbourne
once again—on October 12. Some attrac-
tions have been added to the show since last
year, and a number of new odors are said
to be discernible in the fine capacious smell
of its inseparable accomplice, the menagerie.
The National Amphitheatre advertises a
holiday bill this week, the leading artists
being Les Bow, the Waldrons, the doggedly
humorous Billy Watson and Romanolf —he
of the violin. A critical person or sneerer
might contend that the above resembles any
other old workaday bill, but the present
writer is not, that sort of character.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“Melb”: Brennan’s National Amphitheatre is
turned into a picture-show. Its firm will make an
attempt to whip Melbourne in the line. Meanwhile
the Gaiety, of the same lesseeship, is transformed,
Challenging Mclntosh’s Opera House, The Gaiety is
absolutely giltted, made into a new and luxurious
resort. First part abolished. Reminds me of the
horrible old London Drury Lane style, when “George
Barnwell” used to be acted before the pantomime.
And Charles Kean would act “Hamlet” at the Prin-
cess’s before the Christmas pantomime. What heaps
of material playgoers got for their money. The
curtain rose at seven and fell at 12, except when it
stayed up till 1 a.m.
“Busk”: “florodora” appears again in Melbourne
Her Majesty’s. “Tell me, pretty maiden, are
there any more at home like you?” Hawley, the
great turfite, . fell in love with an English lady in
Rome. To his dismay he found she was married.
She saw through his trouble, and gently conveyed a
hint that she had a sister in England prettier and
cleverer, yet as like herself as one pea is like an-
other. They might have been twins, like the pair
who became Lady Lytton, wife of India’s old-time
viceroy, and Lady Loch, wife of Victoria’s old-time
Governor. Hawley married the sister, who really
excelled specification.
“Oldest Inhabitant”: Apropos Dolores Drummond,
otherwise Mrs. Sprague and Dolly Green(B. 3/10/’l2).
George Goppin’s Olympic was opened in the mid-
fifties of last century, by Jacobs the Wizard. It
was converted: into Turkish baths in the mid ’sixties.
I saw Dolly Green at the old Princess’s in Spring-
street in the late ’fifties, and certainly not in lead‘
ing parts. §he may have played in the Old Ironpot
(the Olympic) in the opening year, but not in the
lead with Brpoke.
. “Motley” : With a goodly knowledge of Australian
circus managers, I cannot figure out the William
Burton referred to in The Bulletin (3/10/’l2)
Possibly he .was a brother or relative of the well-
known Henry Burton, and associated with him in
business. The managers in Australia, to my know-
ledge, have been Abel, Ashton, Bailey, Barlow, Bird,
Chiarini, Cole, Cooke; Cousins, Eroni, Fitzgerald,
FOlis, Gardijjer, Hayes, Harmston, Hyland, Malcom,
Matthews, Noble, Rowe, St. Leon, Sell, Taylor, Wal-
haHa, Wilson and Wirth. Henry Burton had a son
VV alter, a dashing equestrian, who died earlv. Henrv
started his National Circus in Victoria in 1851, and
was known all over the goldfields, and generally
throughout. He occasionally showed in Melbourne
suburbs, but only once to mv knowledge in Melbourne
city, and that was in the Theatre Royal (1860). For
many years he kept an hotel at Redbank (N.S.W.),
and a host of of this paragraph will remem-
ber him Under adversity he had to yield the pub,
and finished,:! I think, at Coppin’s Old Colonists’
Ho ™ e ’ “1 Melbourne. My last meeting with him was
on the Nort&fcote-road, near that place.
Once in a way the giddy stage lady meets the

C i r< T?‘ ,-r e ca^fie last week mentioned the murder
or Miss Frances Dudley, of the ’alls (presumably a
seno- chronic ), by a “toff” who was escorting her
m a taxi-cab. Being merely a maddened member
of the educated classes that such ladies treat as
jugginses, he fired three revolver bullets into his
angel. Had he been a brother member of the pro-
fesh he would have blackened her eyes and left her
ln tears. It is safer for lady variety artists to sport
with the devil they know than the devil they don’t
know. Also, it is safe)? for the devil who knows them
to sport with them than the devil who doesn’t know
them rhe first devil wallops them, and is fined. The
second deviL sometimes gets hanged, and it is awfullv
uncomfortable to be a hanged devil.
~ appears that the most successful verbal joke in
the recent music-hall show, before Royalty, in Lon-
don, was George Robey’s. George was not shy over
appearing before the, other George, as most of his
rivals were, and scored accordingly. Anywav his
jape that went’ best was about his letters, opened
t ! rne ,;, most of them from my old
friend the Count—Count Rendered.” The aristocratic
audience took the point in an instant, and laughed
consumedly. It had Been There. 8
“Vulcan”: September 12 was to have seen Arthur
Collins’s first production of “Everywbman” at London
Drury Lane, with H. B. Irving as Nobody. This is
Irving’s “absolutely first appearance” at the ancient
institution, and his part will probably be a much-
bloated version of Eardley Turner’s local representa-
tion. Collins signalised his (11.8.'5) advent by
handing the book of the piece to Stephen Phillips for
revision. This, according to The Stage’s Noo Yark
critic, is “a wise move,” the play being “not of the
highest literary merit, and the verses do not scan in
many places.” How did this escape the local dailies’
literary and dramatic omnipotence f—or did it, like
Cisneros’ flat notes, only hit them after the box-
office had ceased from troubling and the last advt.
was at rest?
“Adelaide”: One of the most pathetic things I
have met on the variety stage happened lately at
the King’s, Adelaide. A pair of patter comedians had
a song making fun of certain stale old jokes. They
poured especial derision on “100 dollars per. Per
week? Per-haps.” So far, so good; hut within hair'
an hour another pair of patter comedians (who evi-
dently hadn’t been listening) came forth and worked
off that very jest, with a touching confidence in its
freshness and laughter-moving qualities.
“GET- RICH- QUICK WALLINGFORD
AT SYDNEY CRI.
The comic hotel landlord (James Manning)
discharges his stenographer (Josephine Cohan).
Hero hurrying to the rescue.
Talbot. Ltd., opens a dramatic season at Sydney
Palace on October 26, with productions quite new
to anywhere and some others quite new to Atisr
tralia. The opening production will be “The Un-
seen Eye,” a new Australian play by Randolph Bed-
ford. It hasn’t a gum-tree in it except on a front
cloth of Federal House, Melbourne. It is equally
innocent of bushrangers, convicts, noble squatters
and villainous station managers. Neither is there
in it a, black-tracker who says “Massa,” or a lady
who returns to her childhood’s home with her hair
down in the third act, remarking wildlv that she
has been betrayed. There isn’t a baby in it either,
or a woman with a past, or a scoundrel in a blue
waistcoat. But out of .such things as a fraudulent
bank and a conscientious director, and two other
directors who are quite the reverse, and a cynically
humorous and cold-blooded and extremely dishonest
stock _ exchange operator, and the weariest loafer in
the six States, the author makes-three scenes and a
few joyously funny interludes. Madge Mclntosh is to
head a .company which will do her honor, and the
production is in the hands of the meticulously
thorough George Bryant.
Some Thespians make money and manage to keep
it. The late Edward Terry, a famous comedian, left
£44,066. Other fortunes left by notable showmen
are: Augustus Harris, £23,677; Frederick Hobson
Con the stage Fred Leslie), £16,113; W. R. A.
Stirling, £16,227 ; Wilson Barrett, £30,862 ;
George Wilde Galvin (known on the stage as Dan
Leno), £10,994: Herbert Edward Storey (Herbert
Campbell), £4477 ; John Lawrence Toole, £79,984;
Henry Irving, £20,527 ; George Grossmith, £19,628 ;
Emily Soldene, £BOO and the wonderful old bonnet.
Toole s big asset was not the- result of theatrical
work. His lease of Toole’s Theatre, which was re-
sumed for public purposes, brought some £70,000.
“Cockaigne” : Announced that a London theatre
Just abolished its “claque.” Didn’t know it
had one. The “claque” was a solid body of people
paid by the management to sit in the middle of
the house and lead the applause. : The idea still does
regular business in Paris, but in England it is prettv
well confined to the music-halls,-Where it is paid for
by the performers themselves, and not by the pro-
prietary.- It raises the choruses of songs, and keeps
things moving generally. Experience of “claques”
improves one s opinion of them. No frauds <min
support in this way in Paris, and in London foreign
singers find, the assistance of a ..little hired applause
absolutely necessary t. 6 create an-atmosphere in wnieh
they can really do (heir best. When the awful frost
which invariably wraps the British stalls is con-
sidered. a small “claque” right in its frostiest and
most languid centre might add to the enjoyment of
everybody. Deadheads are no use for this pur lose.
They never applaud, but assume a superior attitude,
and try to sneer down the enthusiasm of those who
paid their fare. The deadhead is called a “humnh”
m the land of the Ancient Briton. It is a cofiinv
land of monosyllable, and one which the rival man-
ager can use with crushing effect. Term originated
with one Humphreys, a “wangler,” or dealer in
deadhead tickets.
“Pass”: Who writes the dramas and comics to be
acted before the flicker camera here? Also, what sort
of prices do they get for the job? I’ve heard all
sorts of fabulous figures mentioned as having been
paid to the screen-play writers, and so .1 was tempted
to have a go at it myself. 'Wrote a sample play and
took it to a local firm which manufactures its own
films. The firm took it, and considered it, and re-
considered it, and then shook its* head and con-
sidered it. Finally decided that there might be
something in the business,- and that it would have
the thing pictured. How much did I want for it ?
I’d no notion what to ask, so said modestly that I’d
leave it to the co., and if the pay was good enough
1 could shove in some more plays. The co. said that
it was always open to buy plays, arid couldn’t get
enough, and how about a quid for this one. I stag-
gered back overwhelmed by the munificent offer, and
when I got my breath again said that the co. could
keep the play and the pound and go to Iceland. I
want to know if I struck a crowd afflicted with
strangulation of the pocket-book, or is £1 a drama
the recognised rate?
There is a Mr. Nella Webb. He is, like Mr. Mar-
garet Cooper, a manager for his wife. The person
with the singing wife is a motorist of some note.
He raced in the Gordon-Behnett Cup three years ago
—piloted his own car and' killed nobody, not even
himself. Which, for Gordon-Bennett racing, is some-
thing of a record. If Sam McVea were hafjdy, Huge
Deal Mclntosh might fix up a sprint between the
charioteers, and get therefrom much valuable adver-
tisement.
Plain Bill Holloway (Heaven knows his acting was
plain enough/), step-dad to the brilliant and beauti-
ful Essie Jenyns, now lives in retirement in Surrey
(England). Bill and his retirement are of absolutely
no importance, and Surrey isn’t of much importance;
but this item is inserted to oblige a very old and
illegible contributor who has been dead some time,
leaving three large grandmothers and a small family
aged 60.
“D.M.R.”: London advices tell of the success of
Eric Stone, a youth who has suddenly sprung into
prominence as a vaudeville entertainer in the black-
and-white line. At the present time he is doing big
business with a caricaturing stunt at, the Alhambra,
and is booked for months ahead. Stone, whose real
name is Balderson, is a Victorian, who started his
career under the guidance of Charity Nuttall, and
some of his early efforts appeared over the pen name
of “Bald.v” in The Bulletin of seven years ago.
Later he went to New York, and subsequently drifted
to London, where he set up shop as an advertising
artist. Stone possesses the saving grace of humor,
and the Times, Sketch, Daily Mail, and equally
weighty journals prophesy big. things for him.
“8.J.”: A company of Lancashire- players is (or
was when the mail left) providing ■ what is alleged
to be the best acting seen in London for some time.
Its strong suit is what a large section of the press
describes as an “unpleasant” drama, called “Hindle
Wakes.” A mill-girl indulges in love-making with
her employer’s son. This gent, had been on the point
of wedding a damsel in his own “social sphere,” and
in spite of his protests that his amorous adventure
with the mill-lady was oply “a bit of fun,” the
parents of both agree that he mifist make her An
Honest Woman.. The lady, however, flabbergasts the
two families by refusing to become “honest,” on the
ground that she neither loves or respects her partner
in illicit merriment. He is anxious to do the Right
Thing, but when he asks her if she does not love
him, she answers: “Love you? -Good heavens, of
course not. Why on earth should I love you ? You
were just someone to have a bit of fun with. You
were an amusement —a lark. .. .You wouldn't .pie--
vent a woman enjoying herself as well as a man, if
she takes it into her head:?” So she returns to the
mill, and the episode is closed with such a bang
that the handle of the door comes off.
“Screen”: Little Eugene Deed, the popular Fools-
head of the biographs, was killed while monkeying
with a motor to make a comic picture. His brother,
almost a double to look at, has just, entered upon
the same line of parts, but, alas! it is only Harry
Irving after Henry Irving. Genevieve Ward, back
from South Africa, was asked by the interviewer if
she had not a lion adventure to relate: “Oh, I for-
got, the lion came straight for me. I opened mv
umbrella, and”— “Yes, I know; it fled.” “No*,
fell dead.” In a Victorian country town, the other
day, a cabhorse fell dead of heart disease or some-
thing at the sight of one' of Wirths’ elephants.
“Harrison O.”: “Billy Moore, of Melbourne,
and Bohemia, has scored a three-quarter
column interview in the Pall Mall Gazette
(London), also a big heading, “The Drama
in Australia.” Furthermore, five other' papers
have written about him. In fact, if the inducing’ of
folks to spill ink in his regard did but connote’
wealth, William would be a Croesus. He seems to
have struck London just when the time is ripe. The
aged place has had seasons of Irish, Scawtch and Lan-
cashire plays, and appears disposed to give a hearing
to any new thing in the dramatic line. “Bill” has
one-act plays written by himself, Louis’ Esson,
Blamire Young and Katherine Watson, and hopes to
get some of ’em on at the Halls or as curtain-
raisers. He himself is with Granville Barker, and
will take part in that mummer’s coming production
of “A Winter’s Tale” at the Savoy.

The beaks of Melbourne District Court
sat in judgment, last week, on the case of a
loaf of bread with a mouse inside it, which
was supplied to a lunatic asylum hospital.
One question was whether a mouse can
enter an unbaked loaf in a live state, or
must be placed there, alive or dead, by a
malicious baker before the dough is cast
into the oven. Another complainant having
declared that another loaf from the same
bakery contained “a hairy lump like a patch
from a brush,” the Bench convicted de-
fendant of selling bread which was “un-
wholesome.” After all, the real cause of a
deceased mouse or a brush patch in his daily
bread makes no odds to the person who
buys the loaf. He can only proceed against
the salesman, who, like the hero in the
bellowdrama, declares himself the victim of
a plot to blast his reputation. And here
we. have a suggestion of new dramatic pos-
sibilities. An artless master-baker has the
villain for a rival suitor in the matter of
the heroine’s affections. Villain bribes a
dissolute baltehouse assistant to insert a
dead kitten in a certain loaf, which he (the
V.) duly purchases. Cuts open the bread
and divides the kitten; sends for Health
Inspector, who prosecutes the gentle hero
for selling unwholesome loaf. Hero is
fined five guineas and costs. Villain says
to heroine : “What think you now T of your be-
loved baker-r? Ha! ha!” Dissolute bake-
house assistant staggers in and confesses
the truth with his dying breath. Opportune
policeman jots down confession on the fly-
leaf of his helmet, and arrests the villain.
Title of drama, “The Bread of In-no-cence.”
“Cosmopolite” writes: —
I had looked for more enlightened things from
N.S.W.’s Government than its Early Closing
Bill. This measure deserves, in my opinion,
to be kicked carefully, ruthlessly to death.
It is the thin edge of the wedge of Wow-
serism, the beginning of the end of all revelry
—in fact, it is a monument of short-sighted folly.
The proposal is not the progressive one it is repre-
sented to be; in its essence it is reactionary. Its
effect will be to drag us back to the days when the
curfew bell rang out. And the draggage is unneces-
sary. If the aim is to prevent sweating, that can be
achieved by other means than arbitrarily shutting
up business places which the public need. For
example, by enacting that no one shall toil in them
for more than eight, six or four hours, as the case
may be, in the 24.
Modern Sydney requires not an Early Closing Bill
so much as a Never Closing one —provision being-
made, always, as aforesaid, that no employee should
be prejudiced thereby. If the harbor-side city is going
to take any sort of a place in the world it will re-
quire to cast off the shackles which the Social
Purity folk and the Anti-Beer persons, ijud others
of that calibre are affixing to it. Take its music-
halls. They are the most dingy and sordid places
conceivable. A music-hall should be a big, airy re-
sort, with wide padded seats and spacious gangways.
Smoking should be allowed in the auditorium, and
before each chair should be a stand to hold
a glass, flagon or beaker of drink, alcoholic
or otherwise. Sydney’s halls are not like this, be-
cause, for some obscure reason, they are denied
those rights, as. regards smoking and drinking,
which are freely accorded to local residential clubs,
and which music-halls in other parts of the world
have always enjoyed. Sydney’s supper-rooms are
but tenth-rate places. Why ? Chiefly because the
feeder is denied drink after 11 p.m,, and is emptied
out when your true-blue, all-night reveller is just
thinking of beginning to get merry. Sydney won’t
begin to attract a big- moneyed class from overseas—
despite its perfect climate, its unique surf-bathing
and its other attractions —till it makes legislative
room for the all-night restaurant. And there are
about two dozen other all-night institutions that are
just as essential to the bounding affluence and
prosperity of a great city as all-night trams and
all-night street illuminations. What the Govern-
ment needs to get out of its head is the old, burst
theory that sweating can only be obviated by early
closing. As an outcome of our present-day” indus-
trial machinery, early closing legislation has" become
quite needless. The modern trader is rigidly pre-
cluded from sweating, irrespective altogether of when
he takes down or hoists his shutters.
THE. REVELATION.
THE YOUNGER : “Well, dear, you must have
been indiscreet in some way to let him find
out that you padded.”
The ghost of Pope poked a shadowy nose
into Sydney Quarter Sessions, the other
day, and gibbered in tones of sepulchral
triumph : “There, didn’t I tell you ‘A little
learning is a dangerous thing’?” The Law
was requesting Ray and Fagan to explain
concerning certain allegedly stolen marsu-
pial skins, and it was while one defendant
was questioning the other in order to clear
his character that the much-deceased poet
lobbed in with this hackneyed old dictum:
Fagan: How long have you known me ?
Ray: About six months.
Fagan: Where did you first meet me?
Rav: In Tasmania.
Fagan: What town ?
Ray: Christchurch. ( Laughter.)
Fagan: Christchurch' is in Maoriland, not in Tas-
mania. ( Laughter .)
Ray: Well, in Auckland.
Fagan: That’s in Maoriland.' (Laughter.)
His Honor: Do you, or do you not, know the prin-
cipal towns in Tasmania?
Ray: No, your Honor.
His Honor: How long were you there ?
Ray: Twelve months. (Laughter.)
Verdict of “receiving” against Ray. And
doubtless the shade of the knowledgable
Pope was 2in. taller when it got back to
wherever it dwells these days.
A HEN RALLY.
ALGERNON : “I see that the ladies—haw—
predominated at the meeting against the—
haw—proposed eviction of our Governor-
General from his harbor residence. ”
PATRICIA: " Yes, indeed! The Labor monsters
would deprive us of our garden parties and
conversaziones ."
“Chasuble”: . There was an instructive
brush at the Presbyterian General Assem-
bly, in Melbourne, last week. A new hymn
book was decided on, and Parson Fulton, of
N.S.W., wanted to amend “There Is a
Fountain.” He said that the line, “the
dying thief rejoiced to see,” appeared to him
a libel. The correct word for that male-
factor in the Greek might be either “bri-
grand” or “patriot.” “Nonsense!” ejacu-
lated Parson Walker, of Ballarat. Barked
Fulton: “You don’t know your Greek ! The
word is not ‘thief’ !” A third cheery mem-
ber, by way of easing the tension, or casting
petrol on the flames of debate, remarked,
“Put in ‘bushranger,’ and make it distinctly
Australian.” The deadly earnest Walker
failed to detect the joke. “Yes,” he
stormed, “and make us the laughing stock
of the world!” Moderator Rentoul closed
down on the holy affray by calling for the
vote. There were shouts from all sides for
the retention of “thief” ; so the younger gen-
eration will go on wondering whether a
possibly noble person embezzled or merely
burgled, or rose in noble and patriotic in-
surrection. Barabbas, by the way, was a
Robber (with a canital “R”) —a sort of
Robert Bruce or Suliote or Beggar of the
Sea, or Night-Rider. John of Gischala
commanded the Robbers at the defence of
Jerusalem, and fought splendidly. Then
there is the heated discussion over Mary
Magdalen. The name has been firmly
pinned on to Flossie, but there is not the
slightest proof that Mary was that sort of
person at all. “Seven devils” is another
misunderstood term. It does not mean a
truckload of kicking fiends, but “dreadful
affliction.”
* * * *
The daily papers just reek with valuable
information at times. Thus the Herald.
announced last Friday :
The registrar of pensions at Mudgee received an
application for a baby bonus from a woman with
a baby in her arms.
Surely it didn’t expect the woman to have
the baby hanging down her hack !
What is the greatest possible age for a
veteran? The wonderful United States is
still paying pensions to the widows of vet-
erans of the war of ISI2, and of the ancient
hash-up with Mexico, while pensioners of
the Civil War, which ended almost half a
century ago, are in thousands and thou-
sands. Now it is announced that a crowd
of Garibaldi’s old heroes want to fight for
Greece against the Unspeakable. And
Garibaldi’s European career was mainly
between IS4S and 1567. Is the immortal
Bill Adams still to the fore?
“Y.Z.” on baths:
Re the astonishing
adaptability of the
English. Now that
the hoary myth con-
cerning the Britisher’s
passion for his “cold
tub” has exploded, the
race, by its accredited
spokesmen, has discov-
ered that there is little
virtue in an “all
over” wash, after all.
Presently, I am very
sure, one of the na-
tion’s Thinkers will
lay it down that
hyper - cleanliness i s
really a vice, and a
malign symptom of
effeminacy, and of a
tendency to do all
these things which
are least “British.”
Nor will the Thinker
have any trouble to
impose his view on
the vast majority of
the race, which is
supposed to wash,
but doesn’t. I still
have shuddersome re-
collections of a dear,
old, white >• capped,
fresh - faced, scrupu-
lously neat female of
the London landlady
persuasion, who re-
mained my ideal of a
clean, healthy, frag-
rant, lavender-scented
Englishwoman for
about 2§ hours. I met
her at 4 p.m. on a
warm June day; at
6.30 I asked her
where the bathroom
was. Said she: “But
haven’t you just come
from sea-bathing at
Brighton?” I owned
up, but explained that
ray last bath had been
that morning, and I
was hot and dusty
after the train journey.
She reeled as though
I had struck her. “Gracious Heavens!” she cried.
“In my family one bath a fortnight is con-
sidered sufficient. People must surely be very
dirty who need more.” Yes, I should say
the folks who speak the tongue that Shakspeare spoke
will adapt themselves to their new reputation as
listless washers with some ease.
Then, again, there is the realm or field of sport. The
Briton used to regard himself as the world’s master
at every form of athletic exercise. Latterly, he has
been going downhill as an athlete. The culmination
occurred in the Olympic Games, when J. Bull was
egregiously licked in pretty well every event. Now
the nation is discovering, seemingly, that there is
some peculiar virtue in being beaten at games and
things, and that on the whole its shocking failures
are something to be proud of. The note was
superbly sounded by the Saturday Review, which
advocated, in a recent issue, a scornful retirement,
on the part of Britain, from all international compe-
titions of a sporting character. As the Saturday
regards it, these things have degenerated. Men train
for them with meticulous care. Also, they specialise
most villainously. Those who enter for mile races
decline to compete in the caber-tossing events;
scullers eschew the tennis courts; sprint champions
do not enter for the high jump ; and so on. All of
which is from the Saturday’s viewpoint, loath-
somely “un-British” ; in fact, not to put too fine a
point on it, rankly and shamelessly American. And
so it arrives at the conclusion that an English gentle-
man cannot he a champion athlete. It must be a
comforting thing to be as adaptable as that —some-
thing like being a Christian Scientist in Sheol.

A MEDITATION AMONG THE BOTTLES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The registration of barmaids, which has just been
completed, marks another step in the progress of the
no-lioense movement. No women, other than those
now employed in hotel bars, will in future be allowed
to serve drinks to customers. —Maoriland paper.
In a quiet place of bottles
At the grey and solemn dawn,
E’er the earliest sunshine mottles
Liquids with their corks undrawn,
It is good to sit a-musing
Till the wheels that grind the day
Set their myriad spokes abusing
Peace along the dusty way.
Pubs at early morn are handy
When the thirsty native craves
Soda potions mixed with brandy,
And the large, clear pewter saves
Souls and throats that dryly languish
At the world’s large morning door.
With a half-repentant anguish
Wrought in joy the night before.
Here may simple observation,
Cold, impartial, hold her court,
Judging from her lofty station
Bitter fortune at her sport;
Tyre is dead, and Rome in ruin,
Mocks the greater day gone by—•
Tears for these are somewhat few in
The unheeding public’s eye.
Alexander sleeps, and Csesar
Fertilises herb and flower,
And our own brief days of ease are
Running down with every hour.
Where is all the beer men cherished
In the years of long ago?
Lost, and gone before, and perished,
As the whisky, too, must go.
Nay, the pub itself may leave us
With the joy that cannot stay,
As when errant lips bereave us
Of the loves of yesterday;
Solemnly we walk in trousers,
Fearing all that yet may be,
When the holy, whiskered Wowsers
Save the world with cheerless tea.
Lo, the girl who wipes the glasses,
She is numbered, marked and known,
Doomed to vanish as the grasses
By the Summer winds o’erblown ;
None may in her footsteps follow,
Keeping watch our drinks above,
Teaching thirsty hearts to swallow
Draughts of whisky blent with love.
What, goes next ? Our world is rocking,
Rocking to its liquid base,
Fate, with hard, dry laughter mocking,
Snaps her fingers in our face!
Here this quiet place of bottles,
Opened in the early morn,
Fills with such a fear as throttles
Gladness e’er its smile is born.
See, the sun is up and doing,
Spreading gold along the street,
And a little wind is wooing
Bees to honey they can eat;
Flames the rum to ruby glory,
Glints a diamond in the gin,
While I ponder on the story
Of the death of glad, wet sin.

Judge Russell, in Adelaide Insolvency
Court, has been calling attention to the
folly of farmers in loading themselves with
debts for costly machinery they only use
about once a year. The insolvent under
his miscroscope at the moment had, practi-
cally without capital, taken up 2300 acres
on mortgage, got his stock on bill of sale,
and his agricultural implements on hire-
THEY HEVER ARE.
“ He’s not a bit like the man I should have
married. ”
“No. That's the worst of , husbands , isn't it?"
agreement. Then somebody ashed him for
a little money, and he burst. It is right for
farmers to desire a complete plant of. their
own, said RusseiT mildly—if they can pay
for it. If riot, why not try co-operation,
and move ploughs and reapers from one
farm to another?
“Brass Button” appears for the de-
fendant :
“Mr. Ocky” pours sarcastic remarks and indigna-
tion (B. 3/10/’l2) on the skipper of the Comboyne
for having stuck to his ship when he knew it was
sinking, and he waxes eloquent on “this absurd display
of alleged duty.” it's up to “Mr. Ocky ' to learn
something of what lie s talking about, and then to
do a profound Asiatic grovel and apologise, bumping
his head on the doormat in the process, and next to
sit in the ashes under the grate and consider the
evil of his ways. After that ne should go out and
sleep in the dog kennel. When the Comboyne smote
the breakwater at Port Kembla (N.S.W.), and the
skipper found that it was making water rapidly, he
gave prompt orders for the boats to be got ready.
He head 1 his steamer for the beach, but in a few
minutes ic was plain to him (and to the cook and
the slushy, as “Mr. O.” says) that the ship was
going down fast. He ordered the men into the boats
and sent the boats away. They got off safely, and
the captain and the engineer stayed on board, kept
the engines going, and the ship headed for the shore.
It was a race against time and the incoming mois-
ture, and it was such a close finish that the Com-
boyne finally came to rest in sundry feet of water,
due cantain and the engineer were washed off the
bridge. The engineer couldn’t swim, but got a grip
of the funnel top, which was a foot or two above
the ,roof of the sea. The skipper struck out for the
shore. The boats discharged the bulk of their human
freight, returned, and found the Old Man plodding
hard. He ordered them to go on and look after the
engineer, because he thought he could finish the
journey, while the engineer might get washed off
his precarious perch. No lives were lost and the
steadier sank m a place which made salving a fairly
easy job. “Mr. Ocky” asks: “Why, then, should
the captain remain behind, unless he was determined
to go to D. Jones with the ship?” Because sea
captains make a hobby of trying to save their ships,
and because owners do have some desire to see a
vessel on the fyeach instead of sunk in deep water,
where salving would be difficult or impossible. If
the captain and engineer had left when the crew did,
the Comboyne would probably have been a total loss,
instead of being in dock at the present moment.
“Mr. O.” may hold that no ship is worth the
price of a man’s life, or that the chance of saving
- the one isn’t worth the chance of losing the other.
But it ought to be some satisfaction to the travelling
public (do not let the comp, set this up as the
“drivelling public”) to reflect that a captain who
takes big risks to save his ship is likely to do
the same to save his passengers. Most would
rather be at sea with a man of that calibre on the
bridge than with a prompt deserter in charge. A
man who deliberately risks his life to save his vessel,
and risks it again to send help on to another man,
deserves something better than ignorant abuse. I
hereby sentence “Mr. Ocky” to spend 24 hours in
silent and humble meditation on the Moore Park
tip, if that institution still exists.
It seems to be np
to the wonderful
Council of Churches,
which recently con-
demned the mater-

centive to immoral-

ly whom or what it
represents; or whe-
ther it speaks for
anybody save Peck-
sniff. Heap, Chad-
band, Mawworm and
Co. Since it pub-
lished it s ridiculous
notions the Anglican
and Methodist offi-
cial church papers
have disowned its
views. They state
that it is unthinkable
that any girl would
barter away all that
she will lose by im-
morality for the sake
of a five-pound note,
and point out that
though the law com-
pels the father of an
illegitimate child to
pay up to £lO for
pre - maternity ex-
penses and a vastly
larger sum towards
the child’s mainten-
ance, nothing has
been said by the
blessed Council of
Churches about how
these payments are
am incentive to a girl
to go a-trolloping. Is there really any
Council of Churches? Or is it merely a
self-appointed committee of snufflebodms?
“S.'S.”: George Turri, the Melbourne
patent expert, writes to the Age suggesting
that the Australian capital be called “The
City, of Love;” Says he: “I can think of
nothing more noble or more glorious than
for it to be said of some future Australian,
‘He is of the City of Love, where all the
people are as good and as happy as people
can be.’ ” Yet I fancy Philadelphia is the
City of Brotherly Love, or the City of Love,
or the Shanty of Brotherhood, or something
of the sort, and it is little the better for
it. And Valparaiso is the Vale of Paradise.
And there were Ptolemies in Egypt with
surnames like Philopater and Philometer
and Philadelphus, mostly because of the
relatives whom they murdered. And two of
the worst cities you can imagine are Holy—
holy. Home and holy Jerusalem. (There is
no city of Holy Moses, by the way.) Fur-
thermore, all our troubles are said to have
begun in Eden ; and in England the “Abode
of Love” became such a scandal that the
parson who ran it had his job torn from
him. No, let us avoid sentimental names.
They lead to the devil.
QUITE PLAIN.
HE: “I wonder how it is a girl can't catch a
ball like a man."
SHE: “Oh, a man is so much bigger and
easier to catch."
“G.V.W.”: A naval item from London
Times of 1795: —
There was a very hot press on the river on Friday
night last, when several hundred able seamen were
procured. One of the gangs, in boarding a Liver-
pool trader, was resisted by the crew, when a des-
perate affray took place, in which many of the
former were thrown overboard, and the lieutenant
who boarded them killed by a shot from the vessel.
The story is interesting in that it throws
a side-light on the ancient methods of a
country which didn’t believe in conscription.
Britain has never tried a volunteer fleet in
a big engagement, and the only first-class
campaign in which its purely volunteer
army figured was that of the Crimea. On
that occasion the brilliancy of British arms
was only eclipsed by their splendid failure
to achieve anything.
‘‘Bosun’s Mate”: This startling item ap-
peared recently in the dailies: —
The Board of Trade attributes the loss of the
North Briton, on March 5, to insufficient freeboard,
and points out that 20 lives were sacrificed for an
additional 130 tons of freight. The Board recom-
mends revision of the rules altered in 1906.
The North Briton foundered off Ushant,
and all hands, save one, were drowned.
For years Britannia ruled the waves in
every sense, and the British load line
founded by Samuel Plimsoll was a guaran-
tee that the ship that carried it was im-
pervious to over-loading. Ten years ago
other nations began to adopt Plimsoll marks,
except the Yanks, whose Lumber fleet still
arrives unmarked. The German and Nor-
wegian ships were allotted lower marks
than the British, and a clamor was made by
the British shipowner against the injustice of
foreign ships in British ports being allowed
to load deeper than British ships. Accord-
ingly, the British Government in 1906
called an international congress together to
discuss freeboards. The congress adopted
the continental load line as against the Bri-
tish. As soon as the agreement was rati-
fied the cables hummed with messages all
over the world from British owners to their
oversea agents commanding them to ar-
range for the necessary alterations. They
couldn’t even wait for their vessels to re-
turn to their home ports, but grabbed at the
chance to cram in more cargo straightaway.
The Board of Trade, if it dissented from
the new way of calculating freeboards, never
said so as far as is known. If the loss of
the crew of the North Briton is due to the
lowering of the load line a serious position
has to be faced.
“Belaying Pin” : “Dungaree” is right in his
denunciation of the Kembla Harbor and the
perils thereof. The N.S.W. Navigation De-
partment is asking for a big tragedy there all
the time, and has only missed it by
some hairbreadth margins. One cap-
tain has just missed crashing into
the breakwater five times in two
years, and another almost ran
through the gap left by the washing
away of the breakwater lights. A
lead of, say, two green
lights -on the shore, near
the Northern Break-
water, could easily be
placed so as to clear
both breakwater and
islands, and yet be in
such a position that the
glare of the electrolytic
works would not dazzle
the navigator’s eyesight.
I presume this is some-
body’s business, and if it
is anybody’s business,
why does nobody look
after it?

“Mr. Ocky” : The Port
Phillip Bay steamer
Edina, which has figured
prominently in evidence
taken by the t not-before-
it-was-wanted Victorian
Commission on Marine
Life-Saving Facilities, is
one of the oldest work-
ers; afloat. It began by
carrying stores for the
soldiers engaged in the
Crimean War. ?, It was
in the first flush, more
or less, of comparative
youth when it joined the
Geelong-Melbourne ser-
vice, and it still dodders
daily between these cen-
tres. It is onD half of
its old self (the remainder died of old age, or
fell off and was lost or something )p but the
portion that remains is a good sea-arK, all
things considered. The Excelsior once met
the Edina in Port Phillip, and was severely
worsted. It sank with a hole like a crater
in its chest. I fancy another mishap
to one or another of Victoria’s bay boats
is nearly due, and am hoping that the present
Commission will have got in some effective
work in the way of excommunicating the type
of small boats which is suspended from rusty
pulleys that won’t work, a,nd abolishing the
brand of lifebelt which is provided with rot-
ten fastenings, before the horror occurs.

This item was crowded out of the Corres-

Every now and then the Grand Council of the
“Answers to Correspondents” column (President,
Henry Horsecollar, Esq.) decides .that sortie darned
contributor, who has thrown himself on the intelli-
gence of the court, is over the odds and Into the
basket. Usually he is some, long-distance, corres-
pondent with a baffling question, such as (T) “How
do you-weave barbed wire into belltoppers ?” or (2)
“How many centurions did Csesar kgjck before he was
killed?” or (3) “Has a cow ever been known to
climb a tree?” The council is generally Informed
that the money or beer of two constant or incurable
contributors is hanging in the balance, and that a
full and satisfactory answer will be looked for with
passionate attention. Say, the Religious Editor is.
handed the query wrapped round the usual compli-
mentary bottle of rum. He knows' that it is no use
reeling to the ordinary reliable authorities for
guidance. The dictionary, “Statesman’s' Yfe.ar; Book,”
“Hansard,” “Who’s Who,” “Whitaker’s .'peerage,”
“Statistical Record,” “Dog Tax Return for: 1886,”
“Dr. Foote’s Plain Home Talk,” “Confidences of a
Retired Barmaid,” “Report of the Commission on
Boiled Owls”-—none of these standard works’ are of
the slightest use. Nor do the booksellers know of
any tomes that would be likely to help.' The
thing to be done, if the matter is taken seriously, is
(a) to get some barbed wire and try and weave it
into a belltopper, or (6) to ask the Roman down at
the oyster saloon if he ever heard anything about
Cassar kicking centurions, or (c) to buy a cow and
try to coax it up a tree. Alternatives are ( z ) to
pass the query on like a cronk coin to the helpless
public, or (?/) throw it angrily in the basket. As
a rule the basket wins. But the rule is going to be
broken on this exceptional occasion., A
(he calls himself “Badangora”—accent presumably
on the first syllable) hungers to know “Does the
living population of to-day exceed in number those
dead and buried since history accounts for human life
on earth?” Then he adds sweetly, “Would like to
see answer in your next issue.” The Religious Editor
knows from bitter experience that a plain “Yes” or
“No” will not satisfy “Badangora” any more than
a sausage-roll will satisfy a ravenous tiger. Before
the issue after next could get out he would be clam-
oring for the exact figures. The Bulletin library,
does not include “Vital Statistics of the-Hittites,”
or “Baby Mortality in Crete under the Minoan Civili-
sation,” so no solid details are available. If any-
body has the figures, the Religious Editor is pre-
pared to share his bottle of rum with that person.
It is a simple problem in six propositions: (I)
How many people are alive? (II) How many people
are dead? (Ill) Have all these people remained
dead, or are some of the people who are alive now
the same people who were previously dead? (IV)
If so, how often have they been dead? (V) Do the
dead people include the people who ought to have
been born, but weren’t? (VI) Do the live people
include those who ought to be dead, but aren’t,
Accurate information on these points will be thank-
lessly received.

“Moorabbinite”: I think emus mature

The Lost Sheep, a text worn threadbare
in the pulpit, is now informed with all the viri ‘ J
of real live news for the Melbourne dailies, an
led Tommy O’Callaghan, Victoria’s police chief, i
deny emphatically that he said “Damn in cp nnec
tion therewith. Weeks ago, William and Donald
McMillan, who were laboriously turning the ma e ■
into wool, reported the loss of 5000 sheep from en
station near Kaniva. Sleuths were put upon e
trail of the jumbucks. These were two ebony sleutns
—black trackers from Dandenong —and one pale
sleuth, a Melbourne detective. Sleuths or
they lost the trail of the 5000, and returned to Mel-
bourne. Then Donald McMillan waited upon Jack
Murray, Chief Secretary, and upon Tommy O Cal-
laghan, in order to instigate further search. As ar
as Murray was concerned, the plea seems to have
been met with a snore, and McMillan’s clever imita-
tion of Little 80-Peep did not get an encore.
Wherefore the despondent shepherd hied him (shep-
herds always hie them, according to the pastoral
poets) to O’Callaghan, and expressed certain opinions.
According to the Argus, O’Callaghan (who had re-
cently lost his collie dog Jess, which might have
aided in the search), said, “Damn your opinion.
McMillan then left 'for the mallee, avowing his in-
tention of securing black trackers from Queensland.
Questioned by the Herald, next day, O Callaghan
flatly denied that he had ever said, “Damn your
opinion.” He further explained that the sheep had
been lost three months ago, and that their tracks
would have been obliterated by recent rain. Where-
fore the 5000 are still wandering, and nobody (ex-
cept perhaps the thief) knows the place of their
pasture—not even O’Callaghan’s dog Jess. Much
trouble might have been saved, perchance, had Jess
been consulted in the first place. But it is a relief
to know that the Chief Commissioner did not say
“Damn.'

“Jimmie Pannikin”: I n<”ree with the
contentions of “Bromide” (B. 12/9/’l2), re the
bike-in-war. Outback and Still-Farther-Out, the
vehicle has been quite a feature for some years. The
Outbacker travels light, or heavy, as it suits him. I have
often met a party of shearers, camped for tucker-time,
with their bikes all set up in a mulga garage. The
bike is the machine for the grilled and gritty battler
Back-o’-Beyond. The male teachers at White Cliffs
used to ride thus from Opal City to Broken Hill, to
attend their examinations. Of course, when the
seasons are good, and the plains are a perfect para-
dise, the horse is largely used; but in the grassless
times, the iron animal plays a big part in transport
West-o’-Sunset. Even in the time of my sunset
sojourn, the pack-bike was not uncommon. The
rider had a huge, heterogeneous heap of things
strapped on, over and under and round his second
jigger, which was attached to the riding contraption
by a curious contrivance of the outrigger variety. I
used to think that the time would come when the
wool would be biked in from the Far-Farther-Out
stations to the big Trickle, on dray bikes, but I soon
learned that the white men could, and did, manage the
awful-odored camel better than the Afghan. The
Camel Corps and the Cyclist Corps will Be of enor-
mous value some day out in the Open Spaces.

“Kimbolton”: My Westralian township
bears a name like a beer-logged person hooting
huskily for Charon’s ferry. But for all that it was a
dusty paradise—until a
German sailor drifted in
with an awful contrivance
like a discolored, over-
grown pear, with a curious
little spout on the bloated
end. The pathetic for-
eigner used to blow into
the spout, and the result-
ant coos and gurgles fas-
cinated some of my towns-
fellows. Being pressed to
explain his disturbance, the
ship le s s mariner said
mournfully, “he blay mooch
petter mit a troom for
gombany.” Some depraved
genius thereupon got to
work and made him a
drum out of a sawn-off ce-
ment cask and a sheep-
skin; then he. made a side
or “kittle drum” out of
more sheep-skin and a
nail “kag.” Two canni-
bals volunteered to play
them, and the uproar was
soon swelled by a concer-
tina and a brass whistle.
When they are all . going
together the result is wild
and drunken. The original
outrage is the worst, be-
cause it suggests a super-
animated lark or nightingale trying to carol while
submerged under a feather bed. The only remedy that
I can see is to kill the German.
At Boori (Victoria), during the floods of
September, an Italian rouseabout took his life in
both hands and swam across a turbid flood to an
island, on which two frightened school children had
taken refuge. There he fixed up a small raft, and
by the aid of skill and luelc and good old Roman grit,
he piloted the youngsters in out of the wet. The
little boy and girl were part of the family of a pro-
vident boss cocky. Next day Julius Caesar received a
note and a small parcel from the grateful parents.
The note expressed gratitude, and said Mr. Blank
was reluctant that a brave fellow should be at any
loss because of the great service rendered his family,
hence the accompanying gift. The' parcel contained
a very second-hand pair of Blank’s pants. There was
no second-hand shirt, and there was a total absence
of old boots.

“Tumumu” : In the Bay of Plenty (M.L.)
a million and a half acres of country have come to
to be known as the Cattle Disease Belt. Cattle and
sheep will do well enough there for two or three
months, but after that period they begin to fade
away, and finally decline to worry about breathing.
There is plenty of good feed, analysis shows nothing
wrong with the water, and post-mortems reveal no-
thing in the way of active disease. There are no
poisonous herbs about, and no parasites have yet
been discovered that could account for the gradual
starving of the stock. Yet the fact remains that
stock removed in the early stages of the trouble,
described as “bush sickness,” speedily recover on
other pastures. The general idea is that some ele-
ment is wanting in the soil, and to fully test this
there are rumors that an experimental farm will be
started by the Government in the district. At
present land-owners are losing their normal amount
of repose through worrying over a problem which is
as distressing in its way as the thirst of Invercargill
or the unredeemed pledges in the pawnshop of
Cohen.
“Chloe” : Seeing that spinsters are crying
out against the baby bonus, I should like to re-
spectfully draw the attention of Prime Minister
Fisher to some of the aboriginal marriage laws of
the North-West. There, as soon as a man arrives
at the marriageable age, he is given his bride as
appointed by the chief; but he must, at the same
time, choose from among the passS, superfluous
women of his mother’s tribe one or two super-
numeraries. No woman is thus beyond the age of
hope. On De Grey station, a good-looking native
Lothario refused to take any of the ladies offered
him as partners. He remained a sinful bachelor in
spite of tribal commands, his post as chief house
boy affording him protection. At last, his atten-
tions to nice married gins brought about so many
storms that the boss told him to choose a wife of
his own and settle down. Somewhat unwillingly he
picked out a pretty half-caste, and attempted the
sedate life. But Mrs. Lothario proved to be lazy,
greedy and abusive. She was an expert grub- and
frog-catcher, but she cooked and ate her prey as soon
as she caught it, and only gave her hungry husband
hot retorts and other unedibles of the kind. When
the worthy matrons remonstrated with her, she re-
minded them of little affairs they had had with her
husband, and told them to feed with the dogs. Re-
proof was wasted on her, and she grew in greed and
impudence, till the Lothario household became so
lively a scandal that it threatened to demoralise
the whole community. At this stage it was decided
that monogamy as practised by Lothario was a
failure, and that Sally, an old widow, ugly to the
last degree and lame, should be understudy to the
wilful bride. When the change was decided on, the
bridegroom happened to be incapacitated by rheuma-
tism in the feet, and it was the revolutionist’s duty
to bathe and anoint the afflicted members night and
morning. But after a week’s nursing she found it
too dull altogether, and abandoned it for the delights
of frogging. One peaceful eventide, on returning
home full of frogs and amiability, she found Sally
in possession, bathing Lothario’s legs and tenderly
anointing them with painkiller supplied by the boss.
She took in the situation at a glance, also the
triumphant and scornful glances of all the other
black cats. So Mrs. L. seized the biggest nulla in
the camp, rushed at Sally, and laid her flat with
one dreadful blow ; then she breathed hard through
her nose like an enraged Amazon, and waited for the
onslaught. It didn’t arrive. But, in its stead, an
adoring husband came humbly forward and clasped
her to his coal-black chest. Poor old Sally subse-
quently tottered up to the house to be treated for
a broken head and heart. The head quickly healed,
but she had to take a “walk-about” to let the storm
of gossip blow over. Mrs. Lothario, from that time
forward, was a reformed gin and a perfect wife, for
there was always Sally waiting hopefully in the
offing.

A BALLAD OF DEAD CHINAMEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was high noon on the Broome Port ; and a tall
ship at the pier;
A lazy, squalid, swearing crew tugged at the winch
and gear;
As to the ship a motley squad—yellow and black
and brown—
Caine tumbling down the steep path from the pie-
bald, drunken town.
And one of the squad from Broome Town was a
Chinese, brown and old,
With a face like a shrunken football, and skinny
hands and cold.
His eye-slits winked and fluttered, as lie glanced
from side to side,
And his fingers clutched a belt of gold that lapped
his yellow hide.
For ten years, and ten years more, he had moiled
and scraped and saved;
In twenty days he would see again the land that his
spirit craved.
Three weeks to the lights of Hong Kong—-and the
stink of the i. Hong Kong slums
Would stir his heart, as an Austral heart stirs at the
scent of gums.
There were six men on the pierhead that blistered
beneath the sun,
With one that waited the tide’s rise and the tall
ship’s warning gun.
And slant eyes glint at the yellow stakes, and the
claw-like fingers fold
On what had lined the waist-belt of the Chinese lean
and old.
There’s a gun’s roar at Broome Port that shakes the
trembling ship;
And a Chinese grey as the evening sea, boards with
a tightened lip.
He walks the deck, with his empty belt, as the crew
calls “three times three” ;
And he climbs the side of the tall ship and slides
into the sea.
There’s a dead man at Broome Port, and he lies be-
side the pier;
And the fishes nose at the empty belt that swings in
the water clear.
Out from the pier a tall ship glides, ’neath a sky of
molten brass;
And into a den at Broome Town six gabbling brown
men pass.

“Snell” : Everybody was astonished when
Bill Bell, of Crisscross, went up to Melbourne. Bill
had been dumped down on his 300-acre farm for 15
years, and had rarely been seen off it. There was
no wander-lust in Bell. Everybody was astonished
when he came back with a wife. She was a small,
portly, dark-eyed dame of 44, and the whole matter
had been arranged through a correspondence bureau
—-marriage by letter, two guineas, and find your own
stamps. The new wife had been in charge five weeks,
when the eldest daughter of the bride arrived with
six other children. This must have been a happy
surprise for Bill, as he ran out and fell down the
well, and remained in a state of stupefaction for
several days. He had hardly recovered, and was still
shy of noises and sudden movements, when one morn-
ing he precipitated himself into the house with the
playful airs of a madman bent on homicide. “Ki-
merel” he yelled. “Kimere, you, ’n' tell me whatsa
meanin’ o’ this.” He dragged Mrs. Bell to the
front. Down the dusty track from the station was
marching a shouting band of 60 children, with a
jaunty gentleman in black, ornate with Wowser
whiskers, merrily swinging a gamp in front in his
capacity as drum major. “Woman! Woman!”
yelled the frantic Bell, “what’s this mean ?” The
band was the Sunday-school from . Happy Valley
bound to the picnic ground at Blue Lagoon. But
Bill Bell contracted fever and was a-bed for nine
weeks.
“Sir Octopus”: I see that a question has
arisen as to whether the Holy City of S.A. is, or is
not, infested with toads. I don’t know. I offer no expert
zoological information whatsoever to help out the eop-
troversy. But I first approached the Holy City on foot
—that was in my younger days, when I hoofed it
gaily over interminable roads—and for miles and
miles before I reached the S.A. capital I kept meet-
ing finger-posts. And the inscription thereon was
TOADelaide.

A rather uncommon whale was recently
captured on the Maoriland coast. One of the M.L.
Whaling Co.’s boats landed an 80-footer, and dragged
him to the boiling-down works. Then they pro-
ceeded to cut him up, put him in the pot and wait
for the dividends to boil out. But they didn’t
get a teaspoonful of oil. The whale was more
arid than Canberra. A post-mortem showed that he
had been previously shot, but not caught, and had, as
a result of the wound, contracted a form of blood-
poisoning, which had: the effect of drying up all the ,
oil in his system. In fact, he was in the same cate-
gory with G. Reid’s dog.
AFTER TAKING.
AGENT : “ The fact is, ma'am , there's too much
beer drunk in this house."
TENANT: “Fat lot you know. It's all drunk

Mystic burial item from Tweed Times
(H/9/’l2) :—-
The obsequies were in the hands of Mr. A. Riley,
and gave every satisfaction.
Who got satisfaction out of the obsequies? The Re-
mains? Mr. Riley? Abraham (he of the Bosom)?
Or is the assertion a base attempt to cast aspersions
on the popularity of deceased, and a callous sugges-
tion that his acquaintances were delighted to see
him interred ?
THE CHOICE.
STREET PREACHER (with hopes of a plethoric drunk): Choose whom ye will serve?
Brother , what choose ye?”
PLETHORIC DRUNK'S FRIEND (cheerily): “O ' e chews beer, Mister."
“E.C.” : The civilised man and the savage
are equally absurd when they are confronted with the
unfamiliar. Wherefore I would advise “Pick” and
one or two other scoffers at the bush “newchump”
to shut up or close down, and cultivate the virtue
of humility. While
travelling through
Queensland, some
years ago, . I struck a
well-known township
in the Central Dis-
trict. I had been
staying a few, days at
the hotel when ' the
first motor-car that
had ever tooted into
the place whirred up
to the front door. Nat-
urally the townspeople
turned out to inspect
the horseless vehicle.
But when blue vapor
commenced to spurt
from the stern, they
stampeded and waited
at very respectful dis-
tances for the explo-
sion. It reminded me
of the scare created at
Monrovia (West Coast
of Africa), when the
first steamer entered
the harbor and an-
nounced its arrival
with a scream of the
siren. It took days
to coax the terrified
niggers down from the
bush. What is the
difference between
motor-ear and siren ?
I would dearly like to
put Past Grand Mas-
ter “Pick” into a to-
tally different environ-
ment —say on board a
windjammer beating
round Cape Horn.
Then his “newchump”
might push him scorn-
fully on one side, and
clamber aloft to beat
frozen canvas with his
bare hands. “Pick”
and his friends really
shouldn’t adopt such superior attitudes unless they
know everything on earth and are “newehumps” ,at
nothing. That is to say, I would have them practise
humility, and adopt the gentle reproachful tone I
am using at present. That will do.
“E.S.S.”: Duck is a title generally ac-
cepted as a sufficient recommendation that the bird
wearing it is good game ; but Australia’s two largest
ducks are purely ornamental, and no better ,to eat
than a' tom cat or a bar of soap. They are the
perna, or mountain. duck, and the musk duck
(called by the aborigines godara and beralla). The
first-named is the larger, often reaching 27in. in
length, a handsome chestnut-colored bird, with
green head and neck, and white, green and chest-
nut tintings on the wings. The musk duck is ithe
oddest person in the duck tribe, and . has , many
peculiarities distinguishing him from all relatives
and neighbors. He has a huge head that, seen at
a distance, resembles the top-dressing of a Fijian.
Most of, his clothes are, brownish-black, but he is
also ornamented with buff and white. His most
noticeable feature, however, is the broad, greenish-
black lobe or wattle tucked under his chin like a
child’s bib or feeder, which distinguishes him from
his wife. That lady is smaller than her consort, and
less astonishing of aspect. Musky has great notions
about the rights of property, and will allow no
other duck to trespass on his feeding preserves.
Being a marvellously smart diver, he beats the
flash of the gun; and shooters who know they can-
not hit him, and don’t like the smell of him even
if they could do so, merely throw pieces of pro-
fanity at him and pass on. You can hardly persuade
the musk-flavored person to use his wings at any
hour between dawn and dusk. What flying he does
—and it is pretty poor business—is undertaken at
night to avoid hawks, eagles, and other sorts of
winged hunger that can dine even op musk.
The boodoo, or blue-billed duck, which has black
and chestnut plumage and a light-blue nose, is also
a great diver and a bad aeroplane. The musk duck,
like the grebe, carries its young on its back, and
mumma and dadda divide the job between them.
They feed on worms, water leeches, mussels and
aquatic insects. They use a nest of dry weeds lined
with down from the mother’s breast, and fix up the
hatchery in a hollow stump or a bank of reeds.
The pink-eared duck, which wears a white spot on
the end of its nose and has barred markings on its
waistcoat, sacrifices its plumage in a similar way,
but it steals a heron’s or crow’s nest to save the
bother of carrying building material. When it goes
out for a stroll it takes the precaution of wrapping
the eggs in soft white down. I know a lot of other
things about ducks, but this is enough to go-on with.

"G.A.A.’ (Perth, W.A.) : On the fresh-
as-paint verdancy of the average Jimmy Grant do
I enthusiastically agree with brother “Snell” (B.
25/7/’l2) and “Pick’,’ (B. 22/8/’l2). But the
simple, scions of. John Bull cited by “Snell” and
“Pick” are Bernard Shaws and Solomons compared
with a shock-headed, open-mouthed Yorkshire yokel,
whose hoofs hit the Fremantle quay a couple of
Orient boats back. Yorky’s appalling brainlessness
and general goatocity led him to hit beautiful bother
early. Promptly a pretty party of Perth pirates
palled in with Yorky, and he returned to the Im-
migrants’ Home at dewy eve, stone, motherless broke.
The labor register showed a vacancy yawning at
far-away rural Wagin for a farm-hand, and thither
by express train was Yorky franked. Yorky’s spark-
ling genius didn’t take more than a jiffy to impress
his • employer—a member of Parliament, by the way
—and toil demanding a minimum of brain was ap-
poi tinned Yorky. 11 e got busy'—in his own way.
In sheer desperation the boss cocky next day armed
Yorky with a pony and spring cart, and escorted
him to a distant paddock, the instructions being that
the land which a while back had been cleared of
heavy fallen timber, should be cleared of the small
Wood that had fallen during the early winter. Yorky
spat on his tremendous paws and waded in. He was
left to his toil for the rest of the week, the cocky
in the meantime being away at Albany. The follow-
ing- Monday he rode across' to where Yorky’s piles
of wood were rearing heavenward. Yorky, who was
found pottering about, soon made it apparent that
he had some news of prodigious impbrtance to im-
part. He had made a great FIND. Tremulous with
excitement he told the cocky of the discovery of an
eldorado of “luvlv blocks.” Breathlessly he led
the way to a deserted mia-mia, round which fresh
cartwheel tracks were scored. Peering in, the aston-
ished cocky’s viewed Yorky’s “find”—a pile of sawn
painted pointed blocks. Recovering his wind, he
swore horribly. A new agricultural spur railway
was to pass through the paddock in a month or so,
and Yorky had pulled out and stored for removal
TWO AND A HALF MILES OF SURVEY PEGS ! ! !
“Eddyson”: I consider Billy Eight the
hero of the recent Goulburh (Vie.) floods. Billy
was previously unheard of, and he-is not likely to
reappear, but justice shall be done to him here.
McColl was the first to heals, from. William Light.
McColl was perched on the hoof of .his 1 house at
Bqewick, and had his arms full at the time, being
occupied with the task, of keeping- the head of a large
family above water. Hearing shouts, he looked over
the side, and discovered a total stranger clinging to
his water-spout. The total stranger had a jaded,
clay-colored cow in tow, and was having all he could
do to restrain the disconsolate animal from drift-
ing. “1 say, inis”- - he cried. Then he went
under. He came up again, spouted two yards off
flood tide, and tried again. “I say. mister,” he
yelled, “do you want to buy a cow?” McColl waited
till Billy’s head reappeared, and answered: “No
thanks, I’ve got as much as I can hang on to as it
is.” “Goo’ day!” cried Billy, and went off after
his cow, still clinging to the rope, lie .turned up
next at the Old Store, on River-road. The store-
keeper was sitting on one chimney. Ilis wife was
sitting on the other, Billy secured a perch on the
verandah. “Good day, mate,” he said ; “do you want
to buy a cow?” The storekeeper explained that it
was no time for dealing in stock, and Light got
afloat once more. The old yellow bovine was a
valiant swimmer, and Billy was floating aft, tethered
to her tail, when she reached Gardener’s. “Wanter
buy a cow?” said Billy. Gardener, who was roosting
on his stable, was very short with Billy. He said
he didn’t want any “flamin’ cow.” When next seen,
Billy was snagged in the fork of a tree, to a limb of
wh'ch his cow was tethered, and he was trying to
sell, the frequent and exuberant milker to boatmen
and parties on rafts. No takers. Eventually he
towed his salvage beef to Cates’s farm, most of
which was high and dry, and Cates bought the animal
for £9. Then Billy passed out of cognisance, and
has since escaped recognition. The cow belonged to
Oates, of Gooli; and William had merely made its
acquaintance coming down stream. He was a man
who lost no chances. Such a man would have sold
a dog ,to Noah in the middle of the deluge.

“Eddyson”: Gower was bringing his
motor gingerly along the sodden bush road, when he
noticed a woman about 100 yards ahead, pushing a
small boy into the track. The small boy stood,
with his arms extended, in the way of the car, and
the woman backed off against the fence, in cover of
a clump of saplings. Gower pulled up. “Mister,”
began the boy, “me mother wants to know” “Say
‘please,’ ’Enery,” called the woman in admonitory
tones. “Please, mister, mother wants to know”
“Would yeh be so kind,” corrected the mother.
“Please, mister, mother wants to know would yeh
be so kind ez t’ come up to the house?” “Most
important,” said the woman. “Most important,”
added ’Enery. Gower jumped from his car, and went
to the diffident female by the fence. “Of course I
will come,” said he, “if 1 can be of any service.”
“I’m sure I’m very much obliged,” the woman said
tremulously. “ ’Opin’ we ain’t givin’ you too much
trouble. But it is important in a way of speakin’.”
“May I ask what is the matter?” “It’s that Ben.
Ben’s my husband. He’s a norful trial, sir. You
wouldn’t believe. Well, if you don’t mind, sir, it
seems he's a-hangin’ liisself again.” Gower did his
best sprint up to the house, and cut Ben down, and
Ben recovered. But it was a very close thing for
Benjamin.
THE WEST WAY’S CALL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The west ways call! Ah, hear the ring
Of hobble chains ? The drovers fling
A careless greeting down the track
And ride toward the runs out back ;
And lonely hearts are left, and cling
To hope that summer days will bring
The way ward, rovers back, to, sing .
The west way’s call.
But one sad heart is fearing,
And trembling hope has taken wing.
For stark amid the tree-boles black,
By rotting swag and withered pack, '
Her lover lies. “Where is Death’s sting?”
The west way’s call!

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Beside the dreaming ranges the river runs for aye,
Along the dreamy gullies the light and shadows play,
While sinks the crimson splendor that decked the
dying day.
Oh! when we rode at twilight beside the singing
stream,
By many a murky hollow, alternate gloom and
gleam ;
Then' Life was something rarer than a barren, empty
dream.
The sunset bathed in glory the purple range’s brow,
Among the grey woods hoary we heard the breezes
sough,
When first .was told the story by lips long silent now.
The wandering breezes heard it, the wild bush birds
could tell,
Where winds the tangled pathway along the bracken
dell,
But mountain breeze and mountain , bird can keep
their secret well.
I fain would Tide at even along the olden ways,
Until the lights of Heaven above the blue range
blaze,
With but grey wraiths beside me of long-forgotten
days. .
Forgotten golden noontides and Summer dawnings
dead,
Great eves of purple splendor with the great white
1 '' stars' o’erhead, 1 ' ,
Soft greying skies of Autumn and sunsets royal red.
The ranges stand as ever, the river runs alway,
But Life’s short grief and gladness are nothing but
a day,
A gleaming after darkness—then darkness falls for
aye.

An exhibition of the designs for an Art Calen-
dar. instituted by Messrs. Wooden Coffin and |Co.,
Ltd., undertakers was opened jesrrrdat at the
Royal Art Society’s rooms by the Lord Mayor.
At the distribution of the awards various
speakers spoke highly of the enterprise and
public spirit shown by the firm in thus encourag-
ing Australian art, and, incidentally, high-class
funerals, it is presumed.
Our artist was among the competitors, but, for
some inscrutable reason, his design was turned
down. Here it is.

DR, J. R. M. ROBERTSON, of N.S.H.
South Coast Collieries.
Adelaide has lost two veteran citizens.
1000* 1 ™ Martin was a Cornishman since
lhod, but an Adelaide man since 1853. He
built up the big softgoods business of Bur-
lington House (now a limited co.). and had
a large family. There are sons in Sydney
and London, and S. Africa. James Shak-
speare was more in the public eye. He was
organist of a leading Congregational church
m Adelaide half a century back, when the
pipes were considered Popish, not to say
devilish, and the introduction of an anthem
nearly broke up the congregation altogether,
lie claimed to be descended from the bard
Ills only brother, City Inspector of Ade-
laide, secured the name of William; but
James did his best by calling his home
Stratford Villa.”
It is commonly reported that King
O’Malley will drop his Ministerial job at
the end of this Federal Parliament. He is
a very rich man. He possibly begins to re-
cognise that as a Minister he is a very great
failure. His stock of jokes is about used up.
His wonderful cowboy hat is worn out, and
all his efforts to buy another of the same
size have been a failure. His salvation is
assured by his connection with the Water-
lily Rockbound Church of Cock-and-Bull
Methodists of Saskatchewan, of which he is
a full financial member and a prominent
hMf'hack, with a front seat and a record
of 117 not out. So why should he not enjoy
a well-earned rest?
A movement is on foot in Melbourne to
erect some modest memorial over the un-
marked grave of S. T. Gill in Melbourne
General Cemetery. Gill was an artist
whose sketches are now sought after and
bring long prices. Some specimens are in
the Mitchell Gallery. He was unfortunate
in having looked upon the wine when it was
numerous; and in dire distress ended his
days on the steps of the General Post
Office, Melbourne. Half a dozen lines an-
nounced the fact. The lapse of years has
brought back memories of the dead artist,
and it is suggested that those among the
lawyers of Chancery Lane who bought
Gill’s sketches (he sold at a nominal figure
when the need for drink money was strong
upon him, and his customers were mostly
lawyers) should devote some of the un-
earned increment to throwing a big stone
at Ins memory. Not that it will do him any
good.
S. M. Herald added a biographical note
to its cable re Earl Roberts’s birthday cele-
brations last week. Its history expert did
it—the master touch is unmistakable. Con-
sider this:—
He first saw active service during the Indian
Mutiny of 1863-1868.
The Mutiny broke out in 1857. Roberts
immediately got a billet as staff-officer in
the Punjab. He was wounded in July of
that year during the operations against
Delhi, but was fighting again in September.
Lord knows what put the years 1863-IS6B
into the Herald’s head. But a paper which
declared (last Friday) that the tension be-
tween the Turks and their neighbors had
broken put into active shooting “on the
Babylonian frontier” is capable of mar-
vellous things. It probably fancied that
Cyrus had fired a big gun last Thursday
at Nabonidus.
From the Oldest Inhabitant: —
“A portrait of the late Andrew Clarke,” savs the
Anaus, “is to be offered to the trustees of the
.National Gallery. The late Andrew Clarke held the
position of Agent-General for a number of years.”
And that appears to be all that the Argus knows
about Andrew Clarke. He was son of an old-time
Governor of Westralia; was Commissioner of Public
Works in Victoria in the ’so’s ; was member for Sand-
ridge in the first Parliament, and was the father of
Local Government, being the author and Parliamentary
sponsor of the Act under which municipalities were
established. He was commissioned to form a Gov-
ernment by Henry Barkly, but could not get the
human meat together. Clarke had the unbounded
support of the working classes. He advocated the
abolition of property-qualification for Assembly can-
didates, and was the first to propose trunk railways
After leaving Victoria he held many high Imperial
offices, including that of Governor of the Straits set-
tlements. As an engineer officer he carried out im-
portant works in many parts of the globe. Yet it is
only as Acting Agent-General that the Argus remem-
bers him.
“8.J.H : 0.” ; Australia has a Bernard
fehaw of its own, duly mentioned in “Who’s
Who.” Our Barney is a son of Edward
Garr hhaw, who was a distant relative of
1 shaw s people. G.B.S.’s sister, Lucy Carr
bhaw, inherited one of the familv names.
E. 0. Shaw came from J. Bull’s Other
Island, and settled in Tassy in the early
days. His son, the Bernard who is the ex-
cuse for this par, enriched the world by his
presence at Glamorgan, Tassy, in 1836 (20
years before the super-person), and was, in
his day, the Pooh Bah of the Flyspeck civil
service. At various times he held the jobs
of Goldfields Commissioner, Commissioner of
Mines, Secretary of Mines, Commissioner of
J. Hops, P.M. at Hobart, and Commissioner
of the Court of Requests. He retired in
1904, and is now said to be rioting in
church work; being one of the pillars or
supports of the Anglican faith in the Apple
Isle.
“Monkbarns” in a reminiscential mood :
A few notes on Redmond Barry, who crossed swords
with the Judge Willis firebrand. Barry’s old house
in Bourke-street West, Melbourne, is about to be
pulled do%vn. A tine mulberry tree that the former
owner, planted still remains. Barry, who became a
•Ju<y?e, was a great citizen. Ilis statue stands in
front of the Public Library, and gazes in the direc-
tion of the University to indicate that he founded
both institutions. At his little West Melbourne
house, 70 years ago, he delighted to lend books to
anyone who would come for them, and even encour-
aged the toilers of that day to read in the house it-
self. The land on which the old building stands was
auctioned by the N.S.W. Government in 1838 to one
Dubois for £4O. Barry arrived from Sydney by the
s'ip Parkfield with brother barristers Croke and
Brewster, in November, ’39. On the arrival of the
trio, Arden, in the Melbourne Gazette, announced
that the settlement boiled over like a bush cauldron
with the scum of fierce disputes which pettifoggers
stirred up with their vile chopsticks. Arden was an
ill-tempered man, and his meaning was clear even if
Ins figures were a trifle mixed. In ’39 Barry bought
a block next to the one sold to Dubois. He
appears to have lived there for a while in a little
shanty, but in 1843 he bought out his neighbor for
£l6BO. Dubois had made over 4000 per cent, on
h s investment in four years. Barry then built a
house and lived there until 1852, when he sold the
whole turn-out to Dr. O’Mullane for £12,000. The
unearned increment business was still going strong
He then went to live in Carlton, at the place which
was afterwards sold for the Children’s Hospital, and
finally shifted to Clarendon-street, East Melbourne,
where his mansion could be recognised by the pillars
that held up the front door.
A NECESSARY DETAIL.
ENRAGED EMPLOYER: “Here, take this penny!
—and buy some brains!”
OFFICE BOY : “ Yessir. An ’ wot kind o' brains
do you require!”
Oom Bill Lyne, who has broken up all
medical theories by twice recovering when
the chances were about 1000 to one against
him, got back to his old place in the House
of Heps, last week. William should now
back a horse for the Melbourne Cup, or take
shares in a wild cat. A man with his luck
should make money out of almost any old
horse or any old cat.
“XI.” It is remarked that a regular
cunning dodge of sycophantic courtiers is
to curry favor with a monarch by deery-
his predecessor. This is already practised
with General Bramwell Booth. The latest
English newspapers inform me that he was
the real mainspring of the Salvation Army,
poor old Dad being only the figure-head.
In the gorgeous entry of Barnum’s Show
at Cincinnati, the lovely Queen of Beauty
was drawn on her car of glory by two
richly caparisoned giraffes, two ostriches,
two elephants arid two camels. All humbug.
These animals were tied on and decked
with chains of roses, but all the real pull-
ing was done by a poor old concealed horse.
General Booth represented the magnificent
animals, while Bramwell was the hidden
nag. So the concern is better off than ever.
Only lumber gone. The Edinburgh
Review, just to hand, leads off with an
article on India, proving that it was King
George alone who quenched all the sedition
with his presence. Queen Mary, Asquith,
and the Queen Dowager implored him not
to go, but he would. Greatest monarch on
record, and King Edward is the second.
This follows on to Sidney Lee’s proof that
Edward’s boasted diplomacy was all hollow,
and the press formed a conspiracy of lies.
Remember the efforts to stamp out all mem-
orv of Victoria when Edward ascended the
throne.
Another badly involved ex-Premier (lia-
bilities 18000, assets negligible) has been
added to the list —- Cornthwaite Hector
Rason, a knight, who ran things for a
minute or two (36 weeks and three days, to
bo exact) in Westralia. Cornthwaite was
a striking example of the kindly way Aus-
tralia treats a certain class of Englishman.
He was the son of nobody in particular (in
fact, his father was a naval surgeon), and
he was born in England 63 years ago. He
reached this country at the age of 23, and
lived in a sort of way by being a sort of
agent. His chief asset was .an air of im-
portance. But Responsible Government
came in Westralia, and the gold boom came,
and Cornthwaite Hector rushed things. He
became M.L.C.; then MX.A. When For-
rest went out. Westralia had 10 new Gov-
ernments in 11 years, and every politician
save the dullest became a Minister one' day
or another. Cornthwaite Hector had a
portfolio in a seven months’ Ministry, and
another in a 25 months’ Ministry; and then
he became Premier for nine months. His
political incapacity was a jest, and the
cheerful view he tofik of his embarrassments
was a cause of innocent merriment. But he
snatched a knighthood, and hurried away
to London as Agent-General. Now the
greatness has departed. He says that “help-
ing others” was one cause of his downfall.
The Bulletin never happened to be
around when he was “helping others,” but
Australia is a large country, and he might
easily have done it without this paper hear-
ing of the circumstance.
“Plain White” discourses : —
1 confess it without shame —1 am dead tired of
Johnson. I do not now refer to Railway Johnson or
Alligator Johnson —though I am also tired of them.
I am speaking particularly of Fore and Aft Johnson,
the long, black hitter of live meat, who retires from
the ring every other day, and is so dark that he can-
not be distinguished from his own wearisome shadow.
I have always refrained from attending the long
I dot’s public bangings of white men; but I find that
1 cannot escape him in print. Every morning, and
pretty well every evening, I find this pestiferous
Johnson posturing in the cable column —either retir-
ing like the shadow of a great grief, or advancing
like ignorance to ob-
literate the world. I
have even conceived
a dislike to the esti-
mable gentleman who
has been principally
responsible for bring-
ing Johnson out here.
It is the sort of dis-
like one would have
for a magician who
possessed the awful
power of bringing on
the dark with one
wave of his cheque
book. Have you no-
ticed how the public
intelligence sort of
wanes as soon as
Deadly Nightshade in-
vades the country ? I
don’t regard him as
a man at all, but as
a malign influence, or
an intellectual blight,
or Ten Nights in a
Coal Cellar. I have
seen Black Jack on a
starless night or a
bright summer day,
and I must say he
was restful to the eye.
He looked like a rent
in a circus tent on a
fathomless chasm. I
should say that he is
capable of making a
good living by wear-
ing an all-day electric
advertisement. All the
same, I object to
Johnson, especially
when he retires more
than three times a week. Once a week is quite
enough.
“Herman Hogg” : I have just heard, iu a
bush retreat where I am recuperating, of
the death of Judkins. He meant well, and
was full of energy, and his worst misfor-
tune was his name. I remember when he
first began to loom up in Australian affairs.
Ihere were two paragraphs about him in
the paper. The lady-writer was a brilliant
"ress-woman, yet she didn’t drop to the fact
that a man could have a name like that.
Hut she thought she saw possibilities
about the new apostle. “There should be
some copy in this man,” she said to the
sub-editor. “What’s his name, and where
and how and why did he get the nickname
ol Judkins/” “Why, Judkins is his name,”
howled the sub. “Great heavens!” said the
lady-writer, and she walked out backwards,
tripping over the doormat in her retreat.

—Evidence in breach of promise case.
When a maid meets a gent., and there’s time to be
spent,
They are on for a quiet flirtation ;
And he flirts at his ease, never dreaming that she’s
Doing many a grim calculation ;
While he’s passing the time, she hears wedding bells
chime,
And decides what the house will have in it.
Oh! the thoughts of a girl down Time’s avenues
whirl
Ere Love’s clock has been ticking a minute !
(A tremendous and Fate-laden minute!)
When he’s paid his third call, and his hat in the hall
Signals mutely, “Stand off!” to relations,
There is never a doubt what he’s calling about,
And the post warns the tribal out-stations ;
Ev’ry female with glee asks, “When is it to be?”
While the lady involved keeps on smiling;
No announcement as yet—but she’s spinning her
net
While her lover the time is beguiling.
(Well, he thinks that the time he’s beguiling!)
But the trifler at last feels that something’s been
cast
O’er his head. (’Tis the net she’s been weaving!)
And he shudders to think that he’s right on the
brink
Of the altar. ’Tis time to be leaving!
Then he makes up his mind to get out—or, resigned,
Lets her coax him the very short distance
That remains to be done ere the two are made one—
And she gives him the needful assistance!
(Make a note of it, son, if she thinks he’s the one,
She will render him ev’ry assistance!)

This institution is one of the very few in which the
reserves are well ahead of the capital. Paid-up capi-
tal is £175,000, and reserves are £214,324. It is
an evidence that there is money to be made by run-
ning a small, condensed institution, in which every-
thing is under the manager’s eye—when he is the
right kind of manager. The head office is at Hobart,
and there are 15 branches, all in Tasmania. If the
general manager owned a good flying machine he
could reach the most remote office within two hours.
Outside Tassy the co. merely does exchange business
through agencies. It hasn’t even a London office
of its own, though the Australian Bank of Com-
merce and the Royal of Queensland go in for that
luxury. The profits are very handsome, being equal
to £l9 13s. 7d. p.c. per annum on the paid-up capi-
tal, or £8 18s. lid. p.c. per annum on capital and
reserves combined as they stood at the beginning of
the half-year. The deposits are £1,854,353, as
against shareholders’ funds amounting to £389,324,
which is a very moderate proportion of public money
as compared with the bank’s own resources, and
makes the position of the depositors very solid in-
deed.
Some other figures are as follows:

The net earnings reached their highest figures at
February, 1911, since when there has been a con-
tinuous falling off. This has arisen partly through
increased expenses (probably even in Tasmania sal-
aries have to be raised now and again) ; partly
through increased taxation ; and partly through loss
on the bank’s holding of British Consols. Why on
earth a bank with not even a London office should
want to hold Bull’s rather lamentable securities it
, r< sa y> but presumably it was done because
the business looked old and solid and loyal and
lory and respectable. This is the record for four
recent half-years:—

Loss on Brit. Consols 4,000 4,800
£20,133 £17,221
Even that doesn’t represent the whole loss, for
there was another writing off of £4OOO previously.
Thus the bank’s holding of British Consols ( £160,000
paper value) has stood successively at £136,000.
£132,000, £128,000 and £123,200. Even now the
Consols are valued in the balance-sheet at £77
while the market price at time of writing is down
to about £74, so there are more losses to be
provided for. Whether its British patriotism led the
Commercial Bank of Tasmania into any other losses
it is impossible to say. Though London is com-
pletely off its beat it rushed into the breach, and
bought up £24,000 worth of the famous National
War Loan. This item disappeared out of the bal-
ance-sheet at August, 1910, but whether it was got

“The directors think they are now justified in eom-
plymg with the repeated requests to increase the
dividend to the rate of 7 p.c. per annum.” Per-
haps. The profits for this half-year are above the
average, but one half-year’s figures are no guide to
«s e ( s ha i°i OW ' ,A S „ at June > 190 “. th e profit was
£6348, at June, 1908, it was down to £1831: and
1 * ] vas £2718. Certainly the extra
* J?’ c ' u only , c ; a s for £5OO per half-year, but the
table shows that on only four occasions since 1904
has a sum greater than £5OO been carried to re-
serves while on five occasions the co. hasn’t been
equal to the 6 p.c. Still, the co. is very solid in the
matter of liquid assets. In fact, its liquid assets
are so considerable that it seems to be carrying too
f ° r , the , size , of its business?
Possibly it hopes to launch out some dav, and be-

sibilities. In good seasons the river trade is a verv
good asset, and should grow. This eo. does what a
good many shipping cos. do not do —it allows a
very liberal amount for the depreciation of its ships,
as this table shows:—

Liquid assets. . 24,624 48,156 56,688 61,260
Thus, it seems that all the perishable assets have
been liberally written down. The liquid assets are
something quite unusual. This co., with £lOO 000
°f P a 'd-u p capital, has £50,000 of bank deposits,
£2354 on current account, and £8906 due to it
by debtors. And all it owes to creditors is £6271

almost as well be called the Newcastle and Hunter

During the half-year the co. has done one emi-
nently commendable act. Hitherto its dam at Water-
loo has stood on leasehold property, and the lease
has been set down as a big asset (£11,253) in the
balance-sheet, with a sinking fund against it. The
property has now been purchased, which makes the
position much more definite. As a natural result the
co. is now much shorter of cash than it was six
months ago. This is the position:—

The company calls its reserves £36,409, but on the
other side there st 11 remains the same old paper
01 £°° dwi U item, described as “Parliamentary Rights
and Concessions, £15,000”; and by disregarding
The Bulletin brings the actual reserves to
£21,409, as shown in the table of figures. Whether
this is a true and genuine estimate it is not pos-
sible to say. The two largest items among the
assets are Plant, Mams and Expenses of Installs-
tion at cost, £99,738,” and “Freehold Property and
Buildings at Cost, £30.626.” Apparently this
means that, out of £159,187 worth of assets' (nom-
inal value), £130,364 is represented by properties
at cost Now the freehold land may increase fn
value, but, despite expenditure on repairs, the
plant, mains, expenses of installation and build-
mgs wh-eh constitute a much bigger item, are
liable to grow aged. The reserves consist of “Re-
newal and Contingency Account, £19,982” (after
deduction of the paper item already mentioned) and
Z ? f < a d Qa P 9 r ° fit ’ , £14 , 27 - Probably a good part of
the £ 19,982 is already gone to pay for the ancient
whiskers that have accumulated on those big items
which are put in “at cost.” Still the bus ness keeps
up well, and earns good profits. The last half-
years returns are at a better rate per annum than
anything the co. has earned since 1907.

The trifle written off is a matter of repairs and
alterations, and nothing further has been done at
writing down the value of the leasehold. The bal-
ance-sheet shows the wasting assets and the amounts
written off them as follows: —
Original Written Present

There is .apparently no fixed rule in the matter, and
the writing-off is very casual. It is understood, how-
ever, that the co.’s lease has still rather over 50
years to run, so the matter isn’t as pressing as it
might be. Also the co. has little reserve fund
to fall back upon, and it isn’t wild or reckless in the
matter of dividends. The huge overdraft that was
incurred some years ago to pay for repairs and altera-
tions has been wholly wiped off, and the co. now owes
only £94, and has liquid assets and cash worth
£1033. So the position is fairly strong.

This is a business which bobs gaily up and down with
the seasons. A rush of imports brings grist to its
mill, even though they may be bad for local in-
dustry, and may be bought with borrowed money.
A big harvest, and a rush of wheat and wool and
meat exports, is good for it. It is a cheery gamble,
with big profits and small profits interspersed. Last
half-year was poor, es//eially if it is compared with
the glories of June, 1907 ; but still a decent dividend
half-year was poor, especially if it is compared with
liquid assets. Leaving out ship property, plant,
slips, stores and such like, it has progressed in this
fashion:—
June, 1907. June, 1912.
Cash and deposits .. ..£12,694 £27,900
Debtors 2,458 1,998
£15,152 £29,898
Less creditors.. .. .. 1,942 975
Net cash £13,210 £28,923
The paid-up capital is £56,000, so the reserves and
the stock of liquid assets are very strong by com-
parison. During the half-year which ended at Decem-
ber 31, 1911, the co. made a loss of £1093 through
a collision, whereas this half it seems to have struck
no special disaster. Therefore, the fluctuations in the
business are even more violent than they appear in
the table above: for the second half of 1911 the gross
profit from the purely shipping business was £5124,
while for the first half of 1912 it was only £1902,
which is almost a record for poverty. But, as already
mentioned, it is a violently up-and-down sort of trade
at all times, and when a co., even in a hungry sort of
period, can earn 5 p.c. with something over for re-
serves, and a fair allowance for depreciation, it isn’t
doing badly.

For the seventh time in 16 half-years this co. has paid
a dividend larger than it has earned, and to do so has
taken a cut out of reserves. As a result, the reserves
have only been increased by £1666 since January,
1905. Just now, when every co. should be strength-
ening its position as much as it is able, to be pre-
pared for the bad times which seem to be approach-
ing, this co., like a lot of others, is weakening itself
by declaring bigger dividends than it can safely
afford. Certainly the reserves are very healthy, being
very little short of the capital ( £67,500), but this,
is no excuse for extravagance. However, the co. is
; n a very strong position financially, as this table
shows: —
July, 1907. July, 1911.
Liquid assets .. .. £21,234 £23,114
Liabilities .. .. 1,322 1,352
£19,912 £21,762
So in five years the co. has (1) paid all dividends,
(2) paid for renewals and repairs, and (3) added
£lB5O to its surplus of liquid assets. Gas sales are
not leaping ahead at any tremendous rate, and have
only increased from £10,311 at July, 1907, to
£11,015 for the past six months. Still, shareholders
and creditors need have little immediate fear for their
safety.

The Amalgamated Zinc (Broken Hill) has,
during the last three years, become the largest pro-
ducer of zinc concentrates. Incidentally, it has also
become a fairly large producer of lead and silver.
Its zinc concentrates assay 49 p.c. zinc, 6 p.c. lead
and 9oz. silver, while its lead concentrates —of which
992 tons were produced last half-year—assay 53.2
p.c. lead, 35.80 z. silver and 17 p.c. zinc. Having
half a million shares, its profits mainly depend on
the price realised on its annual output of some
70,000 tons of zinc, contained in concentrates, and
only partly recoverable as metal. For the past 12
months spelter has averaged from £25 18s. 2d. to
£26 11s. 7d. It is stated in the report that every
£1 rise on the price of spelter above £22 (on
which monthly calculations of profit are based) en-
hances the half-yearly profit by £11,500, but it is
well to bear in mind that in order to get that in-
creased profit the Amalgamated has to turn out
70,496 tons of concentrates, containing 34,000 tons
of zinc. This practically means that the co. gets
paid for only a small proportion—about one-third—
of the increased value of zinc contained in concen-
trates. Similarly, a fall of £1 in spelter would not
diminish the half-year’s profit by £34,000, but
only by £11,500. If the fall in price were calcu-
lated on 34,000 tons, a drop of £4 per ton in
spelter would extinguish, the profit. Amalgamated
Zinc paid its first dividehd ih November, 1910, and
up to date has shelled out £225,000 (9s. per share).
In less than three years nearly a million tons of
zinc tailings have been treated as follows:

6 „ ~ June, ’12.. 259,452 70,496 49‘1 „
996,117 287,504
The Amalgamated had also a surplus of liquid assets
on June 30 of £78,869, exclusive of 465,000 tons of
tailings, costing £104,326, that have been paid for
out of profits. It was explained at the half-yearly
meeting that the cash reserves, totalling £133,359,
to equalise the revenue and to act as a sinking fund’
against depreciation, were represented bv surplus
assets and tailings paid for. As a matter of fact, the re-
serves are locked up in the co.’s business, and are
mostly represented by heaps of tailings. The pre-
sent output is at the rate of 3000 tons of zinc con-
centrates per week (say) 150,000 tons a year, con-
taining (roughly) 72,000 tons of zinc. So the
Amalgamated is a very heavy producer, and its pre-
sent rate of dividend ( £75,000 per half-year) is
practically equal to £1 per ton of concentrates.
The profit last half-year was £106,175, compared
with £130,903 for the previous term; but there is
£21,634 to be received as a final settlement on con-
centrates.

The ore reserves at Harden gold mine
(N.S.W.) are barely sufficient to keep the mill going
for another month ; after that there is the option of
liquidation or re-construction. For many months
past the co. has only managed to keep on its feet
owing to the paternal interest shown by Messrs.
Freeman and Horton, the vendors, promoters, general
managers and chairmen of directors rolled into two.
The amount owing to them is £2500. For the year
a loss of £3542 was made, including £2139 written
off for depreciation of plant. Capital charges
amounted to £3778, and these look like a dead loss,
too. Pumping troubles are perennial with this co.;
the recently-erected electrical pump was to solve the
problem, but only added to the trouble. Pumping
costs were about 11s. per ton of ore treated. The
chances of re-construction depend upon the results to
be achieved by diamond-drilling at the No. 6 level;
but the co.’s finances will not be able to stand a
lengthy period of exploration, as it means heavy
expense to keep the mine open, leaving out of con-
sideration the cash needed to search for the lost
values.
* * * *
For 12 months to June 30, the Harden
mine (N.S.W.) crushed 9741 tons of stone. The
null return was £9204 (18s. lOd. per ton). Con-
centrates sold for £5289, and the cyaniding of
sands realised £2166. The average was about 36s
j’ 01 ' ton of ore, but the Harden is a wet mine, and
the heavv flow, together with some imperfections in
the pumping equipment, were mainly responsible
for a loss on working account of £354*2 . The official
report is pessimistic. It pictures the mine as being
nearly exhausted of payable stone. Last month’s
crushing was 918 tons for £2170, which is at the
rate of £2 7s. 3d. per ton, and when last heard
trom the battery was treating payable stone. It is
proposed to bore the deep levels, in the hope of
picking up a payable shoot of stone with the diamond
drill.
*.* * *
Junction North (Broken Hill) is driving
north at No. 12 level on the ore body, which is show
ing good sulohides. Last half-year No. 12 level was
driven on the footwall 67ft. northward, making a
total of 526 ft. along the datum line. This explora-
tion of the lode adjoining the B. H. North’s boundary
is interesting just now, in view of the splendid de-
velopments in, the North. Many theories have been
put forth to account for the sudden disappearance of
3i e "Unction North lode. The schist rock in which
the lode formation occurs is subject to folding, and
the lodes appear liable to considerable displacement.
It is only recently that important lode formations
were discovered in the British mine. The rapid
widening of the North lode at 1250 ft. has also
added years to the life of that mine. Owing to the
widening of the lode and its dip westward, the
Junction North secured a greater length of ore, as
its levels became deeper. The continuity of the ore
at the end of No. 12 level has yet to be determined.

McLean’s Mallee Hen claim. 11 miles from
-’■ld]^ I,a n (N.S.W.), continues to look well at the
165 ft level. The face is showing 3ft. of stone, some
of which is equal to the rich stone recently crushed
at Wvalong. The last lot of 60 tons was put
or of smelted gold, an average of
slightly over 16oz. per ton. All the crushings from
this claim have been rich, and so far nothing to
compare with it has been discovered in the locality.
Kenny s claim, nine miles north, sent nine tons into
Wyalong for a return of 14oz. of gold, and another
show, nine miles to the south of McLean’s Mallee
rlen mine, is said to be shaping well.

In a vague sort of way, Ivlug, 8., M. and
Co.’s head man, let himself go about me firm s mines
jn* the. West the other day. The Lake View and Star
looked" good for another five years. The shutting
down of the Lancefield was unfortunate. Oroya-
Black Range was fading, but its stable mate, the
Yuanmi, was promising, and the Marmont option
at Meekatharra being taken by the Great Fingall, and
rtot the Lake View and Oroya Exploration, as pre-
viously mentioned. A good advt. was also given to
Holman’s pneumatic mill, installed on the Mountain
Queen, and a word or two was added about the
possibility of the refractory Transvaal, lately added
to the former co.’s holding, proving payable.
Boulder Perseverance still backslides. De-
velopments for the half-year ended June 30 failed to
keep pace with the mill. Actual reserves showed a
decrease of 3.3,857 tons, compared with the figures
for the previous term, with a slight falling off in
the average to hoot. The probable reserves, which
are mostly below payable grade, however, remain un-
changed.

Some Melbourne people have optioned the
Edna May, at Weston’s (W.A.). One crushing of 170
tons has already been treated by the owners for an
average of 24ldwt., and another of 250 tons is wait-
ing its turn at the mill. The reef has been proved
down to 71ft., where 7oz. stuff was recently obtained,
and some “over the ounce’’ ore is exposed. The dis-
trict in which the show is situated, however, appears
to lack permanency.
* * ♦ *
More trouble appears to be in store for
Marvel Loch shareholders. The mine being too
backward in development to enable a regular tonnage
for the mill being economically obtained, working
costs are soaring, and, in order to get on with the
work of opening up, further calls will be necessary.
Two directors are now on their way to the mine,
and if they have the real interests of the show at
heart—its finance and sound working—they will rise-
to the occasion and tell the whole truth and nothing
hut the truth when they return.
The fate of the option held by Hamilton
Yeo and others on Great Victoria (W.A.) trembles
on a balance. The lode is quite as big as the local
paper and neighboring optimists say it is, but so far
values have weighed out a hit light. About 9000 tons
have been raised and treated to date, and 7000 tons
of this averaged 12s. 6d. over the plates, with 15s.
6d. per ton hidden in the tailings. Judging by the
option holders’ sampling, however, there seems to be
good, ground for suspicion that the ore from which
thip result was obtained was picked, and, therefore,
not the real average of the mine. Further tests are
made, hut the chances of a deal being effected
are, doubtful.
What amounts to a truce has been ar-
rived at in connection with the Kalgoorlie wages
question. The present agreement, which provides a
minimum of 10s. per shift for surface hands and 11s.
for underground shovellers and truckers, expired
automatically on the 30th ult., but automatically con-
tinues .-until a month’s notice is given by either party.
As neither side wants to have a row, no such notice
has been given, and the present arrangement will, in
all probability, be continued until the end of the
year. By that time an amended Arbitration Act is
expected to be on the statute hook, and the prorrmt
and peaceful settlement of industrial disputes made
as-easy in the West as divorce.

8.. M. and Co. are persevering with ore
experiments at Gwalia Consolidated (W.A.), and
hope some day to make a bit for shareholders. At
present between 70 and 80 tons are being treated for
an average return of 9jdwt., which, on a big
monthly tonnage should, they claim, give a fair
profit. Meantime, wrinkles of worry and other care-
worn signs are beginning to show on their counten-
ance.
Whim Well (W.A.) copper production
mounts up. The last shipment of 2600 tons realised
£15,069, and another consignment of 4500 tons,
which is expected to realise £30,000 or over, is
now on the water. One or two others are being
loaded. Co. also has its eye on the shows around
Ravensthorpe that ruined the Phillips River Co., and
is,negotiating, for £lOO,OOO to begin where the other
crowd left off. Half of this amount has been
secured, and the balance is said to be assured.
To date Great Boulder has recovered
£8,148,387, and paid £3,825,550 in dividends.
Its; next door neighbor, Golden Horseshoe, has pro-
duced about £150,000 more, but has paid three-
quarters of *h million less in dividends. These two
mines head the list of production and distribution in
the West, and after a fair-sized gap are followed by
the Ivanhoe.
“Mundic”: (a) The best-known text-
book on general mining is “Ore and Stone Mining,”
by Sir C, Le Neve Foster and Bennett H. Brough,
but the following deal with special branches: Crane,
on “Ore Mining-Methods” ; Storms on “Timbering and
Mining” ; and Sanders, Parlee and McDonald on
“Mine Timbering,” Also, “West Australian Mining
Practice,” by E. D. Cleland, is worth reading, (b)
You do not mention whether you wish to purchase
outright or to have machinery erected on terms.

All the men came out of the North Mount
Lvell because they considered that some of the
ground between 700 ft. and 850 ft. levels was danger-
ous. It is obviously the duty of the co. and the
authorities to have a thorough inspection, and it
would be better to have more than one opinion. The
recent fall of ground and the consequent death of
three men, at a spot considered to he safe, is an
emphatic protest against an incautious policy. The
high price of copper has been counterbalanced by the
rise in costs and the low average extraction. The
half-year ending September 30, 1911, closed with a
net profit of £69,033. Copper sold at £57 2s. 3d.,
something like £2O below the recent average price.
During that half-year the average extraction per ton
of crude ore was 2.7 p.c. copper, 1.560 z. silver, and
13gr. of gold (0.02700 z.). For 12 weeks to Sep-
tember 4 the average was 2.08 p.c. copper, 1.360 z.
silver, and 14gr. gold, and under recent conditions it
requires more ore to produce a ton of blister copper
than it used to. Copper may he 50 p.c. higher in
price, but average extraction of metals is 25 p.c.
down, and costs are up, so the half-year closes in a
dull atmosphere.
“Kobbi”: Mount Morgan, an increasing
consumer of coal, has long been on the lo °k°ut Wr
something of its own in that line. Some few y
ago it tried the Columbia, a coal show in L.y.,
eventually had to turn it down as being No .K
Then it encouraged with its patronage the Blu ,
Colliery (Q.), which was struggling at the time to
prove that it had coking coal on its premises, but
eventually the coke ovens grew cold with non-success.
A little' later the Morganaire Co. guaranteed to
take yearly 25,000 tons of coal for three years from
the Dawson field, when the proposed State mines
there of Wullie Kidston’s making were linked with
steel and sleeper to Mount Morgan. But that line
having just recently been stopped, by order ot the
money market, the co. has again to turn its head
in another direction. The place now hit upon under
option is the Mammoth, on the Mackenzie River—
the offshoot of the Bluff Co., which was badly frost-
bitten by the cold report of the recent Admiralty
test. A 500-ton parcel will be taken out. the
seam “has an average thickness of 17 ft. of clean
coal”-—at least, so say the vendors; and vendors were,
ever like Brutus, “honorable men.” Mount Morgan is
also operating on the Frenchman’s Plain Mine, near
Blackwater, eight miles from the Mammoth, and a
trial parcel will be raised there also.
Hampden-Cloncurry delighted its backers
last month (Sept.) with a splendid yield of blister
(728 tons) containing by estimation approximately
721 tons of pure copper, 3220 z. gold and 76730 z.
silver. The month’s smelting was 4335 tons of ore —
579 tons in excess of the August run —and the re-;
turn was 481 tons of copper, showing an average
of slightly over 11 p.e. per ton of ore, the balance
of the copper (approximately 240 tons) was from
matte that had accumulated at the works. Since
smelting was resumed in July, some £BO,OOO worth
of copper have been extracted from 9906 tons of
ore. There is approximately £3 worth of precious
metals in Hampden copper, but against this refining
cost would run to about £7 per ton. Hampden
depends on the copper maintaining a high price, not
only because costs per ton of ore are high, but also
because of the big number of shares issued. Hamp-
den has been lucky, first in obtaining the Duchess
mine and some other shows at a low price, and
because it starts a smelting campaign after careful
preparation, with fine copper at £BO. These are
advantages not to be sneezed at.
* ♦ * *
Brilliant Extended (Charters Towers, Q.)
is out of favor. Contributing shares have been sold
down to 2s. Last month’s profit was £1345, fol-
lowing £lOB4 for August and £266 for July. For
September 2676 tons returned £4BlB, and 2500 tons
of tailings were cyanided for £1174. The Extended
has the deepest levels on the field, and will try its
luck down to 3000 ft. The sinking is on poor
stone at present, which fact, together with the
limited reserves, is the cause of the share market’s
neglect of Extendeds. There are 250,000 shares,, so
a small profit, of a few shillings per ton on 30,000
tons of reserves isn’t much to depend upon. Still
the Extended is a neighbor of the B. Deeps, so, like
the latter, it may find a payable shoot in some
corner. The rise from obscurity of New Brilliant
Freeholds and B. Deeps was only brought about
after 20 years of hard prospecting.
* » * *
During September Mount Elliott (Q.)
smelted 5848 tons of ore, and the converters yielded
624 tons of pure copper, 10650 z. gold, and 1187 oz.
silver. The run is up to expectations, for it was
officially stated that some reduction in the monthly
output was probable. Since June 30 the average
has, been 689 tons of copper per month, which is
miles ahead of anv other four months in Elliott’s his-
tory. This is Elliott’s third year, and the returns
are a big improvement on those of 12 months s nee,
when the run for September, 1911, gave 5554 tons
of copper. Backers of Elliotts are hopeful of de-
velopments in new .mines, purchased or under oution.
The Trafalgar mine is decidedly the most promising.
No. 1 shaft, at the north end, is down 69ft.; present
width, sft. ; value 81 p.c. Another shaft, No. 1
S., is down 96ft., with 5 p.c. ore over a width of
6ft. The Hampden Consols is forward'ng about
40 tons per day to Elliott’s smelter. The deepest
level is in nearly 400 ft. from the shaft, the face
showing 2ft. of ore, value 8 p.c. The new shaft is
down 71ft. #
Brilliant Deeps (Charters Towers, Q.)
are quoted lower since it became known that the
half-vear (Sept. 14) ended with an overdraft of
£4170. Expenditure has been heavy and must con-
tinue so. The chairman filled his speech with a de-
scription of development work, the most important
item being the deepening of a new underlie shaft
or hauling winze from No. 4 to No. 5 level. A
crushing of 402 tons since the half-year closed gave
£2696, and if this show continues to crush stone
worth £6 per ton, with 10 head of _ stamps, the
debit will soon be wiped off. St'll, it is difficult to
fix a date for the payment of the first dividend, for
there is so much work in hand that the original
scheme to continue No. 4 west and connect with the
old workings on the hanging-wall reef has been put
back. In fact, the top or hanging wall reef is un-
developed, and likely to remain so for some time to
come. The crushings may be expected to increase
when the new underlie shaft is connected with No.
5. No 5, when last heard from, was showing 3ft.
of good stone at the end, but prospects are rather
capricious. No. 4 has been driven 300;t. on the
reef. No. 5 has been on payable stone for 100 ft.
Reef proved above No. 4 170 ft.

After being in a state of suspended ani-
mation for a decade, the Beaufort district, near
Ballarat (Vic.) is mildly booming, with the Peacock
trail over all. The Hope mine brings all this joy.
It hits out near Trawalla. An eight-man party went
boring for deep ground in the best of hope, because
of the rich shallow runs followed in converging gul-
lies higher up the valley. It bit deep ground, and
wash has been opened up in a top and an under
level; 164 fathoms yielded 5480 z. The Hope now
has a block of wash 350 ft. by 200 ft. opened up, and
values as high as 50oz. to the fathom have been
reached. Yields like these have brought company-
mongering sharks round in great force. Already
there is a West, a North, a South, a West Extended,
an Extended and a Die Hard flutter. The market
men who have jumped in comprise most of the
smarties of Ballarat. So lively times are reckoned
on. The eight original Hope people have taken
nice profits already. They gracefully permitted
Fred Holst to lift 10,000 shares at a “quid,” out
of their original pad of 32,000 shares. As work in
their lease was started only in November last, they
won’t grumble at the short time in which their one
star Hope has crystallised into a three star £lO.OOO
deal, with which to flash out on the lawn during
Cup week. The Beaufort gold is shotty, without the
big specs are typical of the Poseidon and Oath-,
cart gutters.
* * * *
Davlesford (Vic.) Ajax group isn’t flour-
ishing like the green bay tree. The wind went out
when the North Nuggetty bladder was pricked.
September returns from the Ajax mines went
23230 z. from 4483 tons, but in the yields was a
little nest-egg of 4450 z. from the North N.’s mineral
dump and reserves. Ajax, instead of 30dwt. dirt,
has got down to 4fdwt. stuff. Yet there are plungers
who hope that the mine will make better weather
working to the north. Meanwhile, only a com-
bination of sympathy and market popping keeps
scrip off the tiles. As was expected, the crowd that
engineers Ajax did its best lap before the initial
yield; which broke away from the North Nuggetty
example of making the pace later in the race. Cen-
tra Is now have a flat make. There’s no spring in it
with only lOdwt. dirt being milled from other parts
of the mine. So the punter won’t respond. Dayles-
ford mining just now isn’t half as fashionable as its
mineral waters.
* * * *
Captain “Teddy” Miles has at last left
his Melbourne retreat for Burma. Before he went
he lodged a wad of scrip in the Henzai Basin ana
Tenasserin cos. in his safe deposit locker. there,
too, presumably went the little agreement with the
Sydney crowd which admires him and follows his
mining tips. Henzai Basin is in Tavoy, Burma, and
is a big claim with a big river. Miles is understood
to have whispered to himself that he s durned if he
doesn’t think he has hit another Tongkah.
* * * *
Walhalla (Vic.) people and the machinery
merchants who hold plant in some of the mining
derelicts of the htiu don t agree over the cost of the
plant to be erected on the Consols shaft of the old
Extended Co.’s lease. Monthly calls of 6d. were too
stiff for the old hands, and so it looks as if the
plant will have to find its way back to the Yairra
Bank factory. This ends the hope of deep mining
on the north part of Cohen’s reef, unless Great Ex-
tended should hit a shoot of gold in its tunnel.
* * * *
Mount Lyell Consols and Wallaroo (S.A.)
has been crosscutting at the 250 ft. level, and after
passing through 20ft. of low-grade stuff has struck
a seam of better ore on the hanging-wall side of the
formation. It is early to form an opinion as to
the value of the strike, but there has been a good
deal of speculation in Adelaide. Since the better
class of ore was reported shares have more than
doubled in price.
* * * *
The Australian-owned Tongkah Compound
(Siam) produced 67 tons (150,0801 b.) of tin oxide
last month from 62,750 cubic yards of dirt. Taking
the average price of concentrates at £l2O per ton,
the total value is £22,680, which is a splendid re-
turn from 191,750 cubic yards of dredging stuff.
The working costs, when the last report was issued,
were considerably below 6d. per cubic yard. At
that rate the dredging of 191,750 cubic yrards has
been done for £5OOO, and black tin concen-
trates can be produced at a cost of between £2O and
£3O per ton. The working profit for three months
has probably exceeded £17,000, irrespective of the
royalty to the Siamese Government. Under its
agreement the co. has to stack the stones obtained in
dredging on the surface, but returns equal to 2s. per
cubic yard make it easy for this concern to shell
out 2s. per share (div. and bonus).
* * * *
“Praxiteles”: The stupid dislike of numerous Aus-
tralians to using local products is nowhere shown
more clearly than in the boycott of Australian marble
by stonemasons, builders, monumental masons and
architects. In the Benambra district of Gippsland,.6o
miles as the crow flies (and no crow ever flew 60 miles
for a feed) from the reputed Federal capital, lies un-
touched the finest deposit of marble ever known in
the modern world. The old sculptors and builders of
the ancient world civilisations used up the known
deposits of the best marble then worked in Egypt
and Asia Minor. And what they didn’t use the sands
of time covered up. The famous antico jellico, em-
ployed by Phidias, the sculptor, exists at Benambra,
and if it existed at Carrara, in Italy, it would be
worth £lO,OOO per ton. At Benambra, you can get
10,000 tons for £1 if you care to pay for the quarry-
ing and carting. But there are 50 other varieties of
variegated marble of every shade used in the decora-
tion of St. Peter’s at Rome and the Congressional
Library at Washington, the finest ancient and the
finest modern edifices, lying idle and worthless at
Benambra. The Federal capital might be more
cheaply built of this marble than of brick, and it
can be just as easily and cheaply carted there as the
water, the future citizens of Yassberra will be sucking
up out of the dry soaks and buying from the water
distillers of the next century. And Benambra is not
the only marble deposit boycotted and beaten by pre-
judiced architects and graveyard men, most of whom
still come from Aberdeen. The time is ripe to kill
a lot of people who don’t like Australian goods, and
the men who slander Australian marbles should be
among them. » * *

“Ah Too Soon”: One of those genuine long-felt
wants that nobody is likely to fill is the manufac-
ture of counterfeit coins to throw to barrel-organists
and German bands. “Bad money for bad music” is
a home-made motto which I have never been able to
put into practice. On several occasions I got a deal of
satisfaction by throwing down a few steel tap-
washers whenever a dismal noise broke out in the
street below my window. But I was forced to stop
it after a maddened Italian had rushed up the stairs
and attempted to assassinate the tea broker on the
floor below by hitting him with the monkey. The
broker retaliated by pitching the organ over the stair
railing. It landed on its heavy end with a crash, and
started to play “The Last Rose of Summer” back-
wards. All this time the organist was dancing the
Caramba and the Sapristi, and hitting the tea
person with the stunned monkey. It might
have ended in a tragedy if the broker had not, with
great presence of mind, rushed courageously
up the stairs amidst a perfect hail of tap-washers,
and monkev clothes and hair and aimed by his
murderous adversary. It cost me the price of a new
monkey and a’ suit of monkey-ruined clothes to square
the affair. If I had only possessed a handful of
counterfeit coin the Italian would have instantly
ceased, and rushed away to pass some of the
rubbish. Then a kindly Judge would have given him
five years, the executioner would have obliterated the
monkey and organ, and all would have ended hap-
pily-
* * * *
“Kim”: The big Combine is a sort of Republic, or
rather despotism, in itself. I have toiled both for a cop-
per combine in the nor’-west of this State (W.A.)
and for a timber combine in the sou’-west. Their
methods were almost identical. The copper co. owned
all the adjacent boats, mines, railroads, pubs, stores
hasheries, and the butchery, bakery and undertakery.
The timber co. ditto, except that it owned forests
(miles of them) instead of mines. Both cos. had
doctors, midwives, etc., to usher the embryo toiler
into this world; also, they provide the latter with
work when he grows up ; and hand him soap, medi-
cine, food, clothes, shelter, and a little money oc-
casionally. And, finally, they bury him when his
hour strikes. Possibly, as a result of climatic con-
ditions, where the sou’-west co. builds a church, the
nor’-west concern mostly builds a pub. The combine’s
employees intermarry largely, after the fashion of the
ancient Jews. They are suspicious of strangers,
docile, reliable and industrious. The combine’s over-
overlord distributes .justice, and acts generally after
the fashion of the feudal chief, baron or suzerain.
WHOOP!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The erection by the Government of huge loco-
motive works in Ballarat will be regarded as the
“Phoenix rising out of its ashes.” It may be in-
teresting to mention that the celebrated Phoenix
Foundry at Ballarat, which was practically closed
by the Government of the late Thomas Bent, at one
time employed between 700 and 800 hands. The
company built locomotives of an aggregate value of
£1.250,000, while the total wages paid to em-
ployees amounted to £547,000. The establishment of
the foundry was one of the results of the Protective
policy of the State, and the first locomotive building
contract was secured during the Ministerial regime
of the late Francis Longmore —Melbourne Age.
Blow! Blow the blackened forge and set the anvils
ringing! . V , .
The bad old crowd are telescoped—the brighter
days are here!
Once more along the lines our engines will go
swinging,
And Hope will get its steam up at the budding of
the year!
Steam! Steam around the curves and sing their
joyous thunder!
The silver lines stretch straight ahead —the giants
race and sway,
Show to all the Fisher crowd where lies their fatal
blunder,
And we may have Protection ere the rumble dies
away!
Slam! Hear the shutting doors of industries
neglected !
The trade is going from our men—this madness
may not last!
Swift come the leaner times and we are unprotected!
But Wisdom on the engines travels this way very
fast!

A
WOMAN’S
LETTER
Sydney, October 7, 1912.
My Dear Arini. —
. Maoriland’s Governor Islington lays down
his seal of office, or whatever it may be,
early in December, and strikes this port
about the 16th of that month. Thence he
moves . forward in the Orsova to Colombo.
Hurrying ashore, he leaps as one man into
a great Indian investigation. Islington is
president of the august Board of Inquiry
which is going to prod the depths of chaos —
otherwise the unwieldy, carelessly classified
Indian Civil Service, which bulges all over,
and is getting heady in its upper storey and
decayed in its cellar.
Ex-Cabinet Minister McNab (M.LC who
dotes on the dry bones of history, has torn him-
self apart from the Mitchell Library in this
town, and departed for Melbourne. The
books . are now being carefully counted, for
historical works have such a fascination for
McNab that even his spotless reputation
doesn’t save him from suspicion.
Engineer S. .Tickell, of Palmerston
North (M.L.), has been swallowing infor-
mation and municipal dust in this village
for about two months. He is president of
the Institute of Engineers in his residential
isle, and steamed back to that nice-looking
land on Saturday.
A large contingent of Maorilanders, who
were jogging home on October 5, prayed
hard that something unexpected would melt
the hearts of the Huddart Parker Co., and
delay the departure till late in the afternoon.
The chance of. losing their money at Rand-
wick was denied them. Repeated ringing-
up of the hard-worked ’phone only dragged
forth a firm statement that the craft would
go to the tick of noon. Then the ’phone be-
came “engaged” with violence, and shot out
sparks of no information with its accus-
tomed vigor. Next Saturday Maorilanders
have a larger hope of going bankrupt on the
bob-tailed nag if they’re booked to depart
on that date. The Dominion animal is a
irequent entry at this Spring Meeting, and
the outgoing barque for Wellington on the
last race day will probably hug the wharf
till every M.L. quadruped is slung into his
stall aboard.
Even the dull face of George 111. seemed
to take a startled expression akin to intelli-
gence, as his oiled optics stared out of their
gilt frame at the Denmans’ farewell dance.
"We who are about to die, salute thee,
Caesar,” suggested a friend, as we looked at
the rose arches that spanned the double-
jointed ballroom. Pink, creamy white and
blood-red, their scented heads nodded
through lattice frames that turned the beau-
tiful old house into an arbor of delight.
Giant waratahs stood at attention on the
verandahs. Heavy rain had spring-cleaned
the cheerful stars, and they wore their best
sparkle for the Great Good-bye.
Government House was crammed to its
last extremity on Friday night. Society
which amuses itself all the year round is
not acutely distressed at the loss of a dance
or two in Macquarie-street, and it wore its
best clothes with its accustomed gaiety.
But a few of the unfashionables present
wore sorrowful, hang-dog countenances.
The Governor-General, rather down in the
mouth in spite of his gorgeous attire,
dashed lus medals in a State trek down the
ballroom. Her Ex., crowned with dia-
monds, shimmered in ivory satin, with a
*d° u d l a( ? e draping her graceful shoulders.
Ihe official Lancers was not without its
humor, as the. efforts of the Flag-Lieu-
tenant to navigate the Admiralty lady
through the tortuous chain cleared the feei-
mg of De Profundis in the air. Lady Ful-
ler’s fair head over-topped the Admiral, her
partner. Mayor Clarke tore round in his
heavy mantle of office, and perspired visibly
under wads of fur. The tall Barttelot lady
elided through the State dance in a film of
black with a gleam of gold near her white
neck.
Moving round the ballroom came a
crowded throng of all shades of politics.
Ministers of the. Crown, having given the
Crown a nasty kick in the brim, sent along
hurried or urgent reasons for being unable
to be present. Their suffering country
needed their presence elsewhere, and the
TT?Mi- gie l lim P ed down one by one. Speaker
” lllis showed more courage, and bore the
curious glances of the throng with much
fortitude. Various Osbornes, the Jim Gor-
dons (she was the handsome August bride,
Cladys Bowker), the Anderson Stuarts just
back from the microbes of Europe (care-
fuliy initialled by the learned Stuart), the
■) A. Hogues, the mournful Senator Gould
a «d a pretty daughter, Mrs. W. Macleod
f Mosman), Mrs. Richard Arthur and two
daughters, from the same leafy heights
the Luscombes (Victoria Barracks). Dan-
gars, Knoxes, and tons of other large fry
rose to the surface to get the air from time
to time. Government House was so full on
firiday night that, like the little boy at the
end of a bun-fight, if you stuck' a pin
through its middle, it might have burst.
Sydney is full to its chimney pots for
the great carnival of the Horse. *On Satur-
day the Derby and Epsom gave sporty
dames plenty of fun for their money. The
modest half-crown sweep of a few years
ago has almost fled from the grandstand,
and horsey women back their fancies in
mere gold, and sigh for the totalisator, so
that the backing may be done with less
stress of diaphanous raiment. Agar
Wynne’s colt Cider snatched the Derby
Stakes, and Hartfell won the Epsom by an
eyelash or two.
Derby Day grew a chilly breeze in the
shade that sent a shiver through the gossa-
mer finery of the elect. Wise women
dragged fur stoles round their transparent
bodices, and the Denman lady,, sitting snug
inside an ermine coat, was the envy of the
lightly clad. Race-coats were worn with
comfort by those who owned them, but, on
the whole, a wisp of gauzy muslin or lace
showed the female form with alarming
frankness. Coats and skirts in thin summer
suiting chiefly ran to white and blue, and
were much affected by those damsels who
can have their measurements chalked by
high-priced tailors.
The Clarke contingent (Melbourne) in-
cluded Rupert, Russell and co. Miss Sylvia
Ffrench, from the southern State (the girl
who didn’t go to England with Melba
though everything pointed that way) is
trailing expensive frills across the present
fray. The Madden tribe (also Victorian)
is here in its accustomed strength, and foots
the festive round with the elegance of Mrs.
Anthony Hordern.
Lingerie frocks are a pleasing extrava-
gance _ this season. The good-looking Bren-
nan girls, Florence and Adble, though partly
disguised under the roofs of huge summer
hats, were recognised on Derby Day in mus-
lins with large ornamental holes firmly
worked into their frivolous bodices. Mrs.
Harry Osborne demonstrated the beauty of
black the other race day. The Kelso Kings
followed the Horse in all his leaps and
bounds in Very Correct Clothes.
Mrs. Dick Horsfall, in a lime-colored cos-
tume, rather raced away from competition
on Derby Day. The Gordon Wesche lady
also clings to this indeterminate shade with
success. Whites (the Muswellbrook people)
and stacks of country folk, out for sport,
paced the saddling paddock to flatter the
satin-skinned dandies of the course, in their
private apartments.
The madness of the Hat always comes to
a head in a racing carnival. A foot or so
of violent vegetation, standing up to the
Randwick breeze, was one form of floral
frenzy. The ostrich tail sticking out like a
feather-duster a yard or so (more or less)
behind the cranium, is another expensive
freak of this week of Hoofs. In clothes,
there’s a new peaked offence, which is rather
like a lace and silk bed coverlet, if you wear
one corner wiping up the street. Trains on
skirts are stealthily creeping in again.
The peaked tunic, which had its
pointed tail trodden on with enthusiasm
by hurried racing men at Randwick, is the
sly _ forerunner of the old sartorial scavenger
which picked up the city scraps in its hem.
There was a time when inquisitive people
rushed to count the debris which a long-
trained lady left behind when she Stepped
languidly into a cab or carriage—the mate-
rial her frock had gathered as she walked
in all her pride up a street which was even
more neglected than it is now. A nice old
gentleman of my acquaintance tells me that
the biggest abandonment of debris he ever
saw in this line included a banana-skin, half
a pork pie, a quart of dust and a broken
coal-scuttle. That was in his garish youth,
when the jest was still fresh.
The private dance at State Government
House, the other week, was carefully stage-
managed by Aide Dumaresq. Girls who
palpitated beforehand in the dressing-room,
lest, knowing nothing eligible in dancing
pumps, they might droop as wallflowers, were
pursued by partners all the evening. The
backslider who tried to dodge Dumaresq’s
X-rays glance was routed out of his accus-
tomed reverie about the beauty of his socks,
etc., and rushed into action before he had
time to collect a good excuse—hence the
nimble feet of the habitual non-dancing
man.
The new brand of brocade appears to be
a special form of temptation in a soft satin,
with floral posies scattered on its alluring
sheen. It flops into the figure almost as
close as the writhing folds of charmeuse.
One of the handsome Anderson girls, alway
clutching fashion by its forelock, wore a
fascinating floral digression the other even-
ing, with a hint at a filmy panier falling
over its flowery way.
Miss Georgie Neild, greatly daring, has
taken the panier—genuine puffed article —
to her slim person. She waltzed gaily enough
at the farewell Government House party, in
a _ frivolous combination of Dolly Varden
hips and pink shimmer that arrested the
wandering eye.
Dora Olilfsen, the Australian native who
pursues Art in Rome and Paris, lent her
picturesque appearance to recent dress
parades. She is a slim young woman with
an Old Master trick of bagging , her coiffure
m raven bandages, and she slowly spreads
her artistic conversation over a wide area
of Time and Space.
Seoul, in Korea, is reported to have taken
to Y.M.C.A. gatherings with serious intent.
A gentleman with the mixed name of Sey-
mour Rhee is named as the first native per-
son in these parts to swallow the degree of
Ph.D., and he will pass on the results to an
unlettered but listening generation, as
a Y.M.C.A. pedagogue. Wasn’t it a Queen
of Korea, by the way, who refused to believe
in the “peaceful intentions” of the Japs,
and found no good reason to retract her
opinion V This lady was so hurriedly burnt
to a cinder —her nightclothes being soaked
with kerosene —by the peaceful person with
the almond eyes, that she failed to leave
any personal record of her views on the
Y.M.C.A. and similar bodies which seek to
smite her quaint brown subjects-that-used-
to-be with the Shorter Catechism.
At the Charity Fete amongst the velvet
lawns of Ginahgulla (the James Fairfax
mansion on Bellevue Hill) the sale of
fresh eggs was so rushed by housewives
that a new idea dashes to the front. Fod-
der is apparently the most marketable pro-
duce a sale of work can offer to the public.
The YAV.C.A. was the cause of this festive
display of assorted goods. Whether the
eggs were laid in the grounds, “by com-
mand,” or whether leading hens took the
matter into their own feet and organised a
benefit, doesn’t matter twopence. The fact
that £3OO, or thereabouts, can be scooped in
at one afternoon’s sprint for cash (chiefly
owing to a well-supplied forage department)",
ought to put the eternal bazaar promoter
off the track of rags, pen-wipers and illum-
inated texts.
The “Town and Country Matrons” ought
to have given a dance in Paddington Town
Hall before this reaches you. Also
the Tony Horderns and the members
of the Australian Club. Prime sheep
and fat cattle ladies gave such a joyous
hop in this town, during the last frenzy of
race week frocks, that the city dames sat
up and apparently took notice. The amal-
gamated blend of local tramcars and coun-
try mutton is the result.
So sure were some of the butterfly maid-
ens of two Australian Club balls being in
the wind a few weeks ago, that one light-
hearted damsel told me she’d made up her
mind to send a firm refusal. “Two balls
meant slicing up the people asked, into a
frumps’ party _ and a smart dancers’ hop.
I’ve no luck in these matters, and would
have been stranded at the Mothers’ Meeting
Ball —but there’s only one, after all —and
I’m g-g-going!” Some of our resident no-
bility, gentry and others, who belong to the
Australian Club, are amongst those who
are giving a smaller hop, hence the exploded
error.
In spite of its advanced age (84 years)
“The Female School of Industry” is limping
briskly to the front in search of extra cash.
It celebrated its hoary birthday not long
ago with an annual report that hinted at a
gloomy tightness in the money market, and
a profound need for Help. On Oct. 29
Society will toil in the sweat of its lace
handkerchief for the Female Orphan who
is trained at the School in the art of Roast
and Boiled. Mrs. Alex. Gordon is going to
lend her sweet voice to the occasion (in the
Concordia Hall), and tableaux by the Very
Nicest People will be laid on at frequent
intervals.
St. Philip’s Church was draped with
arum lilies for the Forster-Marich wedding.
Draped is the best word to fit the dense
masses of white bloom that rioted in fields
of shiny green foliage. After the knot was
firmly tied, the company bustled off to the
Australia, where the joyous tongue of con-
gratulation wagged furiously. Where it
couldn’t wag in the flesh it telegraphed, re-
gardless of expense, from all over the Com-
monwealth.
The attractive-looking bride, Ilka Marich,
was so heavily laden with presents that a
trained Eye was detailed to watch the silver-
ware—valued by one mercenary visitor as
worth about £650 14s. llfd. The odd money
was just thrown in for luck by the person
of figures. Great thoughts often run in
couples. While the employees of Paling’s
(where the bride’s parent, Mr. Marich,
reigns as over-lord) were buying up all the
cutlery that could be conveniently stored in
an oak chest, as a gift to the lady, the
bridegroom’s employees were doing exactly
the same deed for their tetrarch. Mr. and
Mrs. A. E. Forster will set up .their wig-
wam with knives enough to cut most of the
beef in Homcbush market for the next 20
years or so.
The troubles of a bridegroom don’t always
end with catching an old shoe upon one ear,
and getting away with a few pounds of rice
and confetti down his spine. When A. E.
Forster was gaily driving his charming Ilka
from the Australia the other afternoon, he
struck a new by-law which is liable to stand
up suddenly at any street corner, and hit
the groom who propels his own motor. An
unexpected arm of the Law appeared with
swift legs from nowhere in particular, and,
fixing the joyous young husband with his
eye, he (the arm) opened his mouth and de-
manded the chauffeur’s license. The dis-
tracted husband, who was doing his own
petrol push, hadn’t got such a thing about
his person. So the Voice of the By-law
demanded it so much the more. When the
crisis was climbing up to an acute angle, a
sudden friend dashed into the argument, pro-
duced a chauffeur’s license, and reduced the
Law to a peaceful state of mind. The
conduct of the friend and the sudden col-
lapse of the By-law into pulp were so sus-
picious that a practical joke is more than
suspected. Still, it shows what can happen
to a motor-driving groom who thinks that a
boot full of rice is his only woe.
The wit of Oscar Wilde flashed across the
old Standard Theatre the other night, in
“The Importance of Being Earnest.” The
whole seating accommodation had been sold
out so long before the first night arrived
(the amateur cast repeated the dose on Satur-
day) that the Ministering Infants’ League,
or' whatever charitable excuse the per-
formers had for their flutter into grease-
paint, must have seized quite a tidy eheqque.
The friendly soul who sent along a ticket
for this revel will, I hope, be rewarded in a
Better World with a complete outfit of polo
ponies, for the prospect of standing through
three acts and two waits of not more than
half an hour each seemed to have a large
yawn in the middle. The prospect, other-
wise, was alluring.
Though Burnham, A.D.C., of the Gee-
Gee’s staff, throws about six feet of shadow
on adjacent grass, he’s like Peter Pan and
has never grown up. The joyous youth
of this amateur mummer bubbled up through
a capital performance as John Worthing,
the fashionable stray, who was mixed up
with a manuscript (when too young to de-
fend himself), and left in a hand-bag. This
dashing young sport made such discreet
pecks at the atmosphere when stage tradi-
tion insisted on his kissing the girl, Gwen-
doline Fairfax (Dorothy Luscombe, when
she’s not playing at play-acting), that his
male friends in the audience laughed with
distressing ostentation. Maddened by a
loud “Ha-ha-ha” that dogged his love
scenes, Burnham rushed at the kiss as if it
were a polo goal, and finally took it at a
gallop.
Curwen, A.D.C. on the staff of Governor
Fuller, made a bolder attempt to get within
a quarter yard or so of pretty Ruth
Lumsdaine in his first love scene. He was
Algernon Moncrieff —not nearly such a sar-
torial perfection as John Worthing—and she
was Cicely Cardew in the rollicking per-
formance of Wilde’s play. Curwen soon
gave up any pretence of being above his busi-
ness, and made love with a heartiness that
was quite consistent with the drama as
played at the Adelphi. Mrs. Langloh Want,
apparalled like a French fashion plate,
pitched her experienced stage voice with in-
cisive distinctness as the Society Mamma
Bracknell, and Montague Stephen (who
borrowed his clerical togs from a friendly
parson), though rather annoyed by the
presence of his own hands, was agreeably
articulate. The Governor-General was
marched up t > his seat by a bodyguard of
two dames. Mrs. Langer Owen, the pillar
of the Ministering Children’s Freak, was
top lady in this stampede. Miss Gwen
Davies, one of the promoters of the money-
taking amateur show, was quite clever as the
drab-colored Governess Prism. The curtain
had a fierce argument with its roller after
the first act, and frankly refused to come
down. Then did Peter Pan Burnham giggle
on his garden seat, while Algernon Curwen
poured out a superfluous cup of tea to fill in
time.
Kirkby Lunn has lured the public ear to
listen to her lay, at a steady output of coin
of the realm. Her matinde song, on Friday
afternoon, dragged the multitude to the
Town Hall, with a huge demand for seats.
The decorative bead, as a bitter test of
the temper of the patient Griselda who sews
it on, is a trimming that now wanders up
and down the most extensive frocks. Each
bead, about the size of a boot-button for
choice, is separated from its mates by quar-
ter of an inch of space. Thps it climbs
over every avp“ Me portion of the drapery,
and must car a violent rush of “language”
to the dressmaker’s apprentice who has to
stitch it in its right furrow. Kirkby Lunn
clothed herself in some soft shade of wine-
colored satin at the Denmans’ party, and
was heavily beaded from neck to toe.
Dr. Morrison, the famous Australian who
specialises in China, has followed the best
traditions of light fiction. lie married his
pretty ex-private secretary, Miss Jennie W.
Robins, in London, a few weeks ago, without
any glare of limelight.
Yours in the week of the Flying Hoof,
VANDORIAN.
The Oldest Inhabitant writes about
pubs:—
The corner at which stands the Cambridge Hotel,
Market and Castlereagh streets, Sydney, was recently
sold for £20,000. The corner has been occupied by
a pub for 70 years, the drinkery being known most
of its days as The Travellers’ Rest. The old house
stood a little way back from the alignment (as most
very old pubs did). Its first landlord was Roger
Murphy: its last, as The Travellers’ Rest, John
Higgins. Forty years ago the occupier was John
Rudd, who rivalled Daniel Lambert in size. Up to
the year 1880, on the opposite, or S.E. corner, stood
a similar inn, but of much older date, The Globe
Tavern, dating from the ’2o’s. It was the house
from which Watsford’s coaches ran to Parramatta.
It ceased to be a pub in 1880, when John Frazer
built a house for Government use as a post office,
afterwards removed to the Q.V. Markets.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, October 7, 1912.
My Dear Yarrie,—
Society is indebted to the Grice clan for
an object lesson in how to drag a Governor
into one’s little family matters. Last week
the dailies solemnly reported the fact that
Governor Fuller, attended by his trusty
Wilberforce, went to the Chapter House at
St. Paul’s, “on behalf of the family of Mr.
James Grice,” and presented the Cathe-
dral Chapter with a portrait of the late Mr.
Richard Grice —In oils. If the Chapter had
any special reason for wanting a picture of
the deceased Mr. Grice, and if it was a work
of art worth having, the family of Mr.
James Grice did the Chapter proud in pre-
senting the souvenir. But wliat —in the
name of the Anglican Church!—had the
State Excellencv to do with this Griceous
gift? If he .made a few feeling remarks
about the original of the portrait he had to
be primed with his facts by his secretary.
He didn’t know the Grice lie was speaking
of, or the Chapter he was talking to. And
if lie was making the presentation in a
“vice-regal capacity.” he must have won-
dered what would be his next performance
i n the Grice ■ cause.
Oom Bill Lyne, who was welcomed back
in the House of Representatives, last week,
looks fresh and well in the face, but is
rather shaky on his understandings, and has
lost his surplus figure. An attentive valet
follows him about in his hotel, and doses the
patient at intervals with stuff froin a phial.
Prime Minister Fisher and his handsome
wife motored the convalescent round the
town to see the sights and improvements
which have been during his long ill-
ness. Mrs. Lyne is not in Melbourne with
her lord.
South Yarra hopped joyously at a dance
given by Mrs. Ernest Keep to celebrate the
budding of her daughter, who easily out-
frocked all contemporary debutantes by
wearing her -Presentation gown of silver
brocade. The youngster was at the last
Court held by George and Mary and Alex-
andra. Mrs. Keep, a notable frocker, was
dressed softly in Persian-cat grey-blue,
touched lightly with black. Witchwood, the
family residence, looked its name when fes-
tooned with shaded lights. The moon was
present by special arrangement. There was
a delightful absence of clouds, the family
having been measured for a clear sky by a
heavenly tailor; and the air was still —by
accident. The garden paths were covered
with felt so that the trains of the walkers-
out could be dragged round anywhere. The
Smart Set brdu&ht its youngest daughter,
and every available dancing young man was
coaxed to the scene without winkers. Gerald
Auckland’s handsome daughter Helen was
rival debutante to the gorgeous and feath-
ered Presentation maiden. She wore the
simple white chiffon of a blameless dress-
maker, and put baby roses in her hair
Aancy Isaacs, who acts as associate to her
father. Justiee Isaacs, found time to attend
the butterfly function in rose pink satin.
The Governor-General Denmans, on their
final retreat froin Sydney, this week, were
to motor to Bendigo for the races, and put
up at the Lansells’ show house, where the
retainers stay for ever. I understand the
most recent Mary Ann on the distinguished
premises arrived with her tin box 10 years

The old Fifth' Infantry Regiment, which is
now, under the new regime, the 64th, has the
distinction of being the City of Melbourne’s
•a Footguards—or something of that
kind. The regiment has the right of keeping
its colors in the Town Hall, and its officers
just yearned to have the flags up for the last
civic dance. However, there was some red-
tape difficulty, and red-tape is a very grad-
ual snail, and it failed to disentangle itself
in time.
Correspondence is raging in the British
Australasian regarding the decoration of
the new Commonwealth exhibition hall in
the fetrand. It has been decided that 20
panels shall be decorated by Australian ar-
tists resident in London, and the names of
Fox, Bunny, Lambert, Streeton and Coates
have been suggested. Now, Bill Moore, art
critic of Melbourne Herald, has written to
ask why Australian artists resident in Aus-
tralia should be excluded, and mentions such
men as Norman Carter. Ambrose Patterson,
Charles Wheeler and Max Meldrum. An-
other correspondent thinks the thing will
look like a patchwork quilt if one man isn’t
allowed to do it all. The problem is to be
thrashed out at a meeting at which every ar-
tist resident in London will be permitted to
vote. Then, when each one has voted for
himself, no doubt they will rescind the reso-
lution and start all over again.
The pious and assorted gathering at
Bishopscourt, last Thursday afternoon, con-
tended bravely with a boisterous and gritty
wind. Mrs. Lowther Clarke, in a meek
black and grey costume, and the Archbishop,
with his legs carefully tied up in new
gaiters, stood on a carpet beneath the his-
toric gum-tree, and shed Christian smiles all
round, lawn-sprinkler fashion. The Fuller
yellow gas engine disgorged his Ex. encum-
bered with white spats, and her Ex. in a
green gown that shrieked defiance at the
lawn and all the bushes in the garden.
Auntie Phipps, under a hat sinfully trimmed
with ospreys, walked behind in the care of
Help Wheatley and Secretary Wilberforce.
Prime Minister Andrew Fisher, with his
best plug hat like a mountain on his head,
squired Mrs. Andrew, who looked impressive
in a pleated coat of ninon over blue satin and
an ostrich head-dress. Dames Wrixon,
MacMahon and Forrest, with Bigjol t in
attendance, added their combined we 1 "' tto
the gathering; and Dr. McFarlane," in a
blazing red toga, stood out like a bushfire
against the flock of black-coated brethren.
Mrs. Hodges sauntered in with some of the
Best People after the vice-regal mustard
chariot had oiled furiously from the scene.
Dr. Helen Sexton, after devoting some
part of a well-earned holiday to the Scotch
lakes and thereabouts, decided to climb a
Jvrolean mountain, ere returning home bv
the Trans-Siberian route. She is expected
back at her Melbourne consulting room by
the end of November.
The beautifully groomed Herr Lang is
about to journey back to the Fatherland’s
Black Forest, lhe elegant Herr, who can bo
classed as a scent psychologist, has been busily
engaged sniffing our native flora and judging
its value from a commercial point of view.
During his various wanderings, the learned
calm of local curators and botanists was
rather broken up by his thirst for informa-
tion—a thirst which they were not always
able to quench.
Contrary to the gossips’ expectations, the
Grey-Egerton baronet refused to be left
alone in_ England during his wife’s Cup
visit. He and his daughter, accompanied
by his wife and her daughter, have arrived
together, lhe frocking of the three ladies
of the party was the talk of the ship on the
voyage out; I understand it represented the
verj last possibility in expensive simplicity
Also, Mamma showed up as a tireless chape-
rone, never leaving the dear girls for a wak-
mg minute. (As a ship is all corners, this
must have necessitated some sprints at
times, even suiWiosing that she had some
sort ot honorable understanding with her
charges.) Papa is a tall, soldierly-looking
man, who looks as if any command he
rapped out wouid make somebody jump.

into the modest flatterie at Fairlie House,
where they are renting Mrs. Oswald Watt’s
portion of the abode. After a few hand-
shakes with relatives and friends, Miss

opening night. The odor of moth balls and
camphor hung in the air, for the event pro-
vides the one chance of the year for riring
the bath-gown tvpe of concert cloak that it
preserved reverently in tissue paper by
home-loving people. The Liedertafel pro-
vided a singing pageant called “Merrie
England, wherein Miss Treweek, of Mel-
bourne (a former South-streeter of distinc-
tion), was leading soloist. The late Fred
Heard by the way, came out to Australia
originally as a South-street adjudicator.
Dr. Tom Murphy, of St. Vincent’s Hos-
pital and Bendigo, was married, on Wednes-
day of last week, to Miss Victoria Noonan.
The altaring was done at St. Patrick’s,
after which the party crowded into taxis
and skidded over to the Grand Hotel for the
breakfast. The bride tripped up the joyful
scarlet carpet that covered the steps, with
her soft white train and veil looped jauntily
over her arm, and very trim ankles and
slippers on view. Two plump and pretty
Bendigonian bridesmaids in white, tied up
bon-bon fashion, with soft, wide ribbons of
blue, deserted the independent bride with
great cheerfulness, , and gave all their atten-
tion to their respective groomsmen and the
hang of the streamers on their little prim-
rose bouquets. The young bridegroom looked
as happy as could be expected in tbe regu-
lation high silk hat and long-tailed coat. A
few intimate friends helped at the toasting,
and, later, waved good-bye to a smartly-
tailored bride and her willing life-slave.
A matrimonial engagement shining with
the high lights of intellectual polish is now
the talk of college quarters. The high con-
tracting parties are Edith .Morris, of the

Following on the opening, last week, of
the new State Geological Museum (an
Aladdin’s, cave of interest near the Trea-
sury ) f Minister of Mines Mcßride formally
welcomed the new Director of Geological
Survey, Mr. H. Hermann, to his rocky
corner. The retiring E. J. Dunn, was at
the same time affectionately patted out with a
silver salver presented by the officers of the
Mines Department. Old chief Dunn was
with the Department ’way back in the early
days, from 1864 to 1871. He left for private
practice in South Africa, but was drawn
back by the Victorian Government five years
later, and has delved industriously for it ever
since. He was appointed Director of Geo-
logical Survey in 1904. Hermann, the new
man, recently married Flo Solomon, a pretty,
dark-eyed girl from a seaside suburb.
The waning Gaudess, Mrs. Davey, last
week spread her presence over the meeting
of the Ladies’ Work Association, the club
which finds a market amongst, the rich, and
arrogant for the work of poor but resource-
ful women, who would rather perish than
approach the rich and arrogant in person.
Dainty sewing, skilful lace mending, and
preserve-making of old-time “stillroom” fas-
tidiousness are the Homeworking Ladies’
chief lines. An exhibit of their work is to
have a place in the Arts and Crafts show,
which opens in the Town Hall next month.
Edna Armytage has come home for the
race-time revels, bringing in her train some
of Bananaland’s squattocracy as guests for
the horse carnival. Aileen Bell, who is
granddaughter, or great-granddaughter, or
something of the late Joshua Peter Bell,
knight (the famous man who built a moated
fortress somewhere about Toowoomba), is
liand-in-glove with Miss Edna. The two
girls have three dressmakers and a tailor
supplying them wPh clothes. The Army-
tage girl has been wintering up north with
Mrs. Lumley Hill, the joyous young widow
who inhabits Bellevue station, near Bris-
bane, and has just had a vice-regal visita-
tion.
Irene Young, a small, black-eyed sprite
of a girl, daughter of the Yetholm Youngs,
is to be married this month to Dr. Duguid. a
young Scotsman who came to Australia to
wed and remained to practice. Whilst
motoring through the country, Duguid dis-
covered a doctorless waste, and immediately
hung his brass plate and red lamp on a
gum-tree. He is a clever surgeon, and when
a patient came to him with a broken back
and his head torn off and sent ahead of him
in a truck, the new medico treated the ruin
with great success, and .restored him to his
friends in perfect repair. The ruin, as a
matter of fact, has since been returned to
I arliament, and the truck stands outside
I arliament House as incontrovertible evi-
dence. Now the Mallee has so much work
tor Dr. Duguid that he has hardly time to
get married, and he certainly hasn’t time to
commit bigamy.
As usual, the G.-G. establishment will in-
uulge in a. Cup-time round of frivols consist-

group will dance, and the largest herd will
walk about the grass at its own expense and
enjoy _ the blissful sensation of being inside
the vice-regal palings and outside the vice-
regal strawberries.

At a drawing-room meeting, arranged to
furnish the plate chest of the new Inter-

asked to contribute a spoon or fork. The

it looked like the samples of an old and
successful burglar.
Nancy Grice, the keenest sport of a sport-
ing family, had a spill just at the close of

a brambled fall on his cheerful face.

At last some definite effort is to be made to regu-

are asked to keep to the right, and not to hold
long conversations in the middle of the pavement.
Ihe Mayor is almost apologetic in announcing this
innovation, and swears that the police who give the
move on order will be gentle and tactful—sugges-
tive rather than mandatory. As things are, people
who. are in a hurry usually walk in the gutters—
leaving the road free for cyclists and motors, and the
pavements for mothers and their offspring and peram-
bulators. It is the custom of the matrons to pull
up their caravans and exchange confidences one with
another, what time would-be passers-by climb the
perambulators or walk over the prostrate forms of
the infants. If the Mayor is a man of his word,
these athletic stunts are henceforth doomed.
Captain Walker, who is no longer A.D.C. at Gov-

Lieut. Moncrieff (Navy, not Army) acts as stop-
gap.

Superfluous Hair in Australia.
ITS INCREASING PREVALENCE TROUBLING
LADIES. A WOMAN’S CLEVER DEVICE FOR
MEETING THE DIFFICULTY.
For some unknown reason the growth of superfluous
hair on the face and arms of comparatively young
ladies is becoming far more frequent than it used to be.
Women under 30 have been noticed with quite visible
hair on the chin or upper lip; and after 30 it is
the exception, rather than the rule, for the face to
be entirely free. Thick hairs on the awns are, especi-
ally to brunettes, a great source of distress when in
evening toilette.
There is no sort of depilatory which can be used
without aggravating the trouble; for the moment you
destroy the hair it begins to grow again, and, of
course, the tip of the new hair is as thick as the base
of the old hair, and each use of the depilatory makes
the growth coarser.
By an ingenious invention, perfected by the well-
known Edinburgh specialist, Mme. Tensfeldt, ladies
can destroy the hair roots for themselves, each in the
privacy of her own room, with the certainty that no
hair can by any physical possibility grow anew from
the same root. The new self-treatment apparatus
works by electrolysis, and is used by thousands of
ladies at home, and compared with repeated sittings
at a beauty-parlor it is really much more economi-
cal. It does not give any shock, nor can the curreiit
be felt. A slight prick—less marked than the sensa-
tion which would be caused if the hair were pulled
out —is all that is noticed; but the root is dead tot
all time! The apparatus costs only £5 55., carriage
paid; and when done with can be returned within
six months, when £1 ss. will be paid out in exchange
for it. The address is Mme. Tensfeldt, 120 a Princes
Street, Edinburgh, Scotland, to whom remittance
should be made payable.*

POLITICAL
POINTS
“E.D.”: The Jaypee system of Victoria
is a maddening thing for lawyers, litigants
and public. A case was heard in a Mel-
bourne police court a few days ago. It
lasted all the morning, and when the horse-
hair for the defence finally sat down and
wiped the sweat from his brow the chair-
man of the bench said: “Sorry, but the case
will have to be adjourned until next week
for a further hearing, as we are divided.”
Six of the usual type of Jays were on the
bench, and there was no way of dividing
them unevenly except with an axe —the way
Solomon nearly did to the infant in Pales-
tine.
“B. J.H.0.”: The Watt Government,
w T hich is never tired of throwing bouquets
at itself for its efforts to populate Victoria
by bringing immigrants from abroad, sternly
discourages any attempt upon the part of
its employees in the police force to populate
the State from within. The Victorian John
Hop commences his unpromising career on a
wild, mad remuneration of 7s. a day. In
two years he jumps to 7s. 6d., and in an-
other two years he makes a further leap to
Bs., and if he is a single Hop he is provided
with quarters. On the other hand, if he
acquires a Mrs. J. Hop, and, possibly, one
or more young Hops, he receives an allow-
ance of sixpence (one zack sterling) per
day, in lieu of quarters, fuel and lighting.
The John who takes unto himself a missus
under these circumstances is a cove whom
it were base flattery to call a chump.
THE WATCHER.
The Board of Trade attributes the loss of the
steamer North Briton, which occurred on March 5,
to insufficient freeboard, and points out that 20 lives
were sacrificed for an additional 130 tons of freight.
The chap who attends to freeboard and similar
marine details.
The Jonah-and-the-Whale section of the
East Melbourne (Vic.) electorate lost its
chance of returning gassy little Weedon to
the local Assembly in place of Earthing,
when the contest was artlessly advertised as
Beer v. Bible. So many people lean politi-
cally towards Beer, in preference to Bible.
Moreover, it was felt that little Weedon had
nothing save his frock-coat and belltopper to
associate him with the Sacred Book.
Premier Watt’s plea for constructing
railway workshops at Ballarat and Bendigo
(Victoria), at a cost of £BO,OOO each, is a
move for the encouragement of decentralisa-
tion. And immediately his Cabinet had de-
cided on the step, Geelong and other country
centres wanted to know why they weren’t to
be decentralised likewise. While he was
about it, Watt might as well have carried out
the decentralisation policy thoroughly, and
have built the State shipbuilding yard at
Portland or Westernport, instead of Wil-
liamstown. Decentralisation is a good deal
of a joke. The fixed idea is that, so long
as the congestion of Melbourne isn’t seri-
ously interfered with, Watt may decentralise
till the cows come home.
The Greater Sydney measure, just passed
through the N.S.W. Mutilating Chamber,
had a bad introduction by Flowers, M.L.C.
He was abjectly apologetic. Ilis strongest
argument was that “No great harm could
take place” by the passage of the Bill. He
went on to say that “he wanted frankly to
admit that he was not vei M * much
enamored of municipal government.” Later
on, when asked elementary questions upon
the objects of the Bill, he made the brilliant
remark, “I desire to express myself in
favor of nothing.” The measure had to be
explained by Carruthers and “Tom”
Hughes, who certainly had read it, which
Flowers plainly hadn’t, and who understood
the idea, which the Minister plainly didn’t.
Most Government measures, nowadays,
when introduced by Flowers, are explained
by Hughes, or Ashton, or MacLaurin, or
somebody else who afterwards votes against
them.
ON THE ART OF INGRATIATION.
....Money is tight....If we do nothing to at-
tract and to reinspire modern capital, we may he
quite certain that it will not come....It will natur-
ally go where most is done for it....No doubt it is
not a bad thing that money is tight.—S. M. HERALD.
THE INCORIBLE KID : “Ah, if only I could
inspire 'im with sufficient confidence t' come
'ome an’ stay with me! ”
The increase in the importation of human
bodies to Victoria, during the past few years
of “immigration policy,” has not kept pace
with the increased intakes of other foreign
goods. These have swollen from £l2 to
£l6 10s. 9d. per head of the population be-
tween 1906 and 1911. the total value of im-
ports last year being nearly £3,000.000
greater than the exports. The
value of money orders and
postal notes issued in Victoria
was about 34 per cent, higher
last year than in 1906, but
what this has to do with the
prosperity of the State only a
statistician can surmise. No-
body knows. The extra trans-
mission of money by post may
mean that an increased num-
ber of friends at a distance
are liard-un. The fact that
imports have greatly swelled,
whilst exnorts have slightly
diminished, suggests that Victoria in gen-
eral is not making its fortune, anyhow.
The S. M. Herald’s unfortunate his-
torical and geographical expert—presum-
ablv the one who writes articles about how
Cook was the original discoverer of Aus-
tralia —got in early on the day of trouble.
He reported the firing of the first shot “on
the Babylonian frontier.” Now, in what
part of the Herald’s backyard is the Baby-
lonian frontier?
Higgs, M.H.It., made a new departure
recently when he attempted to move a vote
of censure on the Opposition, While he was
reading his motion, the Speaker said
“Order” six times, and Groom said “Chair”
twice. And after Higgs had finished, the
Speaker “named” him once, ordered him to
sit down once, made him apologise once,
said “Order” three times, and told Higgs
once that he was disorderly. One of the
reasons why Higgs desired to censure the
Opposition was “the notorious lack of har-
mony between its leaders.” Which is
humorous so long- as Higgs, the Protection-
ist, makes his bogus pretence of harmonising
with Hughes, the Foreign-trader.
“A r m e s” : The
British Territorials
are on the wane.
Present strength
only just over
250,000. while the
establishment should
be 313,288. The force
boomed somewhat
about two years ago,
and Haldane w a s
jubjlant, but it al-
ways fell hopelessly
short of the estab-
lishment. In this
year and the next
there will be 175,000
free to resign if they
chodse. Turning
back even to Hal-
dane’s introduction
of the system, there
will be found an un-
dercurrent of feeling
that it is a last re-
sort prior to Univer-
sal Service. It will
be the salvation of
the nation to have
all the aristocrats
and hooligans mixed
up. The English
idea, which must be knocked on the
head, is that soldiering, the noblest duty
of a citizen, is only fit for a drunken black-
guard. There are even London publicans
who refuse to serve a soldier in uniform.
Officers are ashamed of their official clo,
and go about in mufti whenever they can.
British amateurism will never cope with Ber-
man professionalism on equal terms.
A cable message of last week read thus:
“Five large cotton mills in Lancashire have
amalgamated, with a capital of £1,500,000.
French financiers promoted the scheme.
But for the two Victorian Judges, Isaacs
and Higgins, the Australian High Court
would be a place of ancient views. Griffith
is a splendid lawyer, but his politics belong
to the Middle Ages. Barton’s politics are
anparently a reflex of Griffith’s. Now that
O’Connor (who is about half-way between
Griffith and the 20th century in his outlook)
is sick, the court is equally divided on many
matters. It has its flying machine end and
its Noah’s Ark end. The casting vote be-
longs to the Noah’s Ark end.
This is Oakes, N.S.W. Tory candidate
for the Senate, on King O’Malley: —
Now, take Mr. King O’Malley, the great “Christian .
and Democrat,” as he styles himself —the Minister who
steps out of the train and. grasps the nearest porter
warmly by the hand, saying, “ Wal, Brother! -so
that the unthinking may say, “What a fine Christian
and noble Democrat O’Malley is!” Mr. O Malley
divides humanity into two classes —-white and black.
He has no time for black. Then he divides
the whites into “workers” and “non-workers ’
—and he says he has no time for the “non-
workers.” Mr. O’Malley next divides the workers
into unionists and non-unionists —and he has no time
for the non-unionists. Finally, he divides the union-
ists into two more classes —those who believe in King
O’Malley and’those who don’t. He has no time for
those who don’t.
“II.II.” : Looking at the map of the pro-
posed Greater Sydney, it is a question if
the business hasn’t been overdone and
turned into a sort of jest. The suggested
area to be ruled by the new Council ex-
tends away up the coast northwards past
Narrabeen. goes out north-west into the bush
far past Hornsby, and west beyond Parra-
matta. Still it doesn’t extend to Katoomba
or Gosford, so matters might be worse.
The law of “adverse possession” has
raised a weird sort of situation at Toorak
(Melbourne). A piece of land in Wash-
ington-street was Claimed by the Australian
Deposit and Mortgage Bank, and also by
Thomas Henry Craine. who pleaded “ad-
verse possession” ; i.e., that he had occupied
the territory without his title being ques-
tioned for a sufficient quantity of years. The
High Court decided in Craine’s favor. It
seems, though, that Craine erected his fence
2i)ft. from the street alignment, and as his
occupation only entitles him to the portion
of which he took actual possession, he has
no right to the 2ft. 6in. street frontage.
This belongs to the bank. So, apparently,
if Craine wants to get on to his property
he has to get the bank’s permission to tread
on its property, or else he must arrive by
aeroplane, unless the bank can legally pre-
vent him from whizzing through the atmo-
sphere immediately above its real estate.
If it can, it is difficult to see what Craine
can do.
The Federal Minister of Customs had his
“attention drawn” (good old phrase!) last
week to the fact that Australia’s one big
match factory has had to close, and that
several hundred fairly well-paid work people
are now not paid at all. When the average
wage was only about three times that paid
in England the concern struggled along
with its little scrap of Protection, but when
the Wages Board raised the minimum for
men another 9s. a week, and the tariff re-
mained the same, the industry naturally
perished. The Minister’s reply was mem-
orable. He would do nothing for Australian
industry or; Australian workers. Said he:
“I feel that, if we opened any one question
the whole tariff would have to be re-
opened.” And why, it may be asked, is this
wretched loafer paid a big salary as Tariff
Minister except that he may re-open the
tariff when it requires re-opening? Tudor’s
plea is practically that he prefers to let in-
dustries perish and people be unemployed
because, if he doesn’t, he will have to sit
up and attend to the work he is paid for.
WHEN THE SPEAKER IS DEPOSED.
Mr. Willis says he wilf leave the Chair with honor.
Assassination of Julius Casar Willis.
The N.IS.W. Government, which nowa-
days seems to be a tired and sloppy body,
Pas discovered that under its Early Closing
Bill no newspapers could leave the office to
catch the country trains until 7,30 a.m.,
which would make the paper so late in arri-
val at outlying places that it would look
more like a weekly than a daily. Or, rather,
the Government was told of this fact, and
then it made the discovery. So it is going
to repair its hurried and perfunctory
scheme. It seems to be always repairing
some hurried and perfunctory scheme or
another.
Now and then there comes into this
world an infant cursed with low-comedy
parents who think the offspring a handy
mark for their mirth. Hence there was one
Australian infant, born about the time of
the first Federal referendum, with a father
who was an enthusiastic unionist and also
a member of a cavalry volunteer regiment.
And he tried to name the kid Federation
Australian Horse Smith. The same kind
of humorist was very prevalent in the early
days of U.S. literature, and he had a habit
of inventing slouchy heroes and calling
them “Tipperton Tipps” or “Slopperton
Slopps.” Now Minister O’Malley, of
America, feels a desire to call the Austra-
lian metropolis “Captaincook,” after the
manner of these South African monstrosi-
ties, Harrismith and Ladysmith. As a
mere matter of euphony Brucesmitli would
be better; and Brucesmith was partly re-
sponsible for the dreadful place, while Cap-
taincook wasn’t. But why not call the
metropolis Bumble, inasmuch as it was
created by parochialism, assisted by mean-
ness, spite, lying, jealousy, and all the other
smaller emotions?
JANE HOP: HIS JOB.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A batch of 17 constables was “carpeted” before In-
spector Canty for allowing their rooms at the
Russell-street police barracks to be in an un-
tidy condition. The specific charges concerned
the presence of three dead matches under one con-
stable’s bed, a piece of orange-peel under another,
dust on a policeman’s locker, and not having the
window-blind at the regulation height. The punish-
ment of Inspector Canty consisted of a severe repri-
mand, with a warning of more drastic action for a
repetition of the offences. —Melbourne Argus
That Summer morn is gloomy when
The foully-burgled citizen
Mourns frenziedly for what is not;
For heirlooms in the melting-pot—
Gold spoons and silvern wedding-plate,
Chaste salver, boshter trophy-cup....
While, on the job that cannot wait,
Jane Hop, cop-housemaid, tidies up.
When Burglar Bill ascends to see
What lies beyond the balcony—
What treasure-trove is hidden there,
Jane Bobby, sweeping, doesn’t care;
And all the screams of startled shes,
The groans that go with the garrote,
Jane Hop, who toils on bended knees
At scrubbing-duty, fails to note.
What though there’s trouble brewing where
Bill Burglar with new candle-grease
Anoints the carpet on the stair,
Jane Hop’s the man to keep the peace.
Peace, perfect peace, beyond a joke!
Poor hope that Jane will douse that glim
While yet the boss, peace-keeping bloke,
Can find a slushy job for him!
VICTORIA.

LUMBAGO.
RELIEF OBTAINED FROM DR.
MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT PILLS
AFTER PHYSICIAN HAD FAILED.
Mr. P. H. Quinn, of 29 Bay Street, Glebe,
writes “My occupation taking me out in
the wet, I contracted a cold some time ago.
and it settled in the system, causing me to
suffer severely from lumbago. I was under
a doctor, who said I was suffering from
rheumatics round the heart. I, however,
came to the conclusion that he was not cor-
rect, so thought I would doctor myself, and
started on Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills.
At times I suffered such pain that if I sat
down I could not straighten myself up, ex-
cept by degrees, but I was pleasantly sur-
prised to find Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills
were doing wonders. I started on two at a
time, and then afterwards reduced the dose
to one. I do not suffer at all now, and
attribute my recovery to their pse. I use
about a bottle a month to keep me in good
health, and cannot speak too highly of them.
After a full meal I take one, which assists
the liver in its action, aiding digestion. You
may use this if you wish.”

SPORTING
NOTIONS
“K.” : The annual Horse Carnival begins in
Melbourne this Saturday at Caulfield. Among the
three-year-olds that may start for the Guineas there
is nothing with special pretensions to Derby favor-
itism except Ratheale, who is said to have gone
‘•light” of late; so, unless something wins very
easily, the prospects of Cider and Co. are not likely
to be dimmed: The Debutante Stakes is expected
to go to one of the visitors from Sydney. The Caul-
field Stakes' appears a good thing for Lady Medallist.
And if a promising Caulfield Cup horse is to win
the Toorak Handicap, it may be Uncle Sam, who
has nothing to fear from a penalty.
A portion of the £30.000 or £40,000 de-
voted to improvements at Flemington racecourse is
to be sunk in sewering, but above ground there will
to be a lot to show for the money when the Melbourne
Cup crowds assemble. On the Hill the long stand
has been lengthened considerably, and under the new
wing will be a vast cooling storage for womankind,
furnished with seats and a fine array of mirrors—a
place where the Sex can escape from the hurly-burly
and restore the glories of its early morning plumage,
or get out of the wet on a rainy day. This new
“lounge” strikes the top-note, thusfar, of Secretary
Byron Moore’s policy of making Flemington as at-
, tractive as possible to the feminine multitude that
cares least about the racing. Down below, on the
lawn stretch, a new grandstand has been erected,
which will offer a better general view of the course
than the original structure, though it is too far from
the winning-post to give its occupants a fair idea of
(he result of a close finish. Under thia stand will be
a circular refreshment bar of vast circumference,
enlargements of the old tea-rooms for non-members
and members are features of the V.R.C. im-
provements, and these increased facilities for
feeding under pleasanter conditions than here-
tofore will be duly appreciated on Cup Day.
Incidentally, Byron Moore has provided a
cloak-room for a couple of hundred waitresses, who
were formerly wont to plant their hats and outer
garments in any odd nook or corner. The scheme
of improvements in the course itself began at the
Stewards’ Stand corner, and the narrow end of the
Lawn leading to the Paddock has been widened by
the abolition of the unnecessary lane enclosure, along
which the horses used to return to scale after a race.
The old procession of perspiring gees is a thing of
the past. Only the three or four placed ones will
return to scale through an adjacent gate. By the re-
moval of the lane, a lot more space will be given to
th.e traffic that congests at the bottle-neck end of
the Lawn. Also, on the Hill the sightseers will get
more room from the shifting of the bookmakers away
from the front of the Stand to the far end of the
slope. Some 150 poles and boxes, each pole bearing
a bookie’s name on an iron tablet, testify in their
gaunt array to the public need for legalisation of the
Tote. On the Flat is another battalion of similar
.poles, and Lord knows how many unmarked spaces
are dedicated to Isaac Pilate and his Christian
brethren in the Grandstand betting paddock. This
increasing army of parasites will inevitably bemoan
its “losses” over the coming V.R.C. carnival, and
swell its aggregate banking account by about three
times the amount of money which a Tote would
'.yield to the club funds and the oublie charities.

Backers of The Parisian for the Mel-
bourne Cup have been relieved of further anxiety by
the scratching of that rare occasional champion.
The gelding’s weak spot is one of his heels, and this
developed a crack last week, for the third or fourth
time in his wild career. The Parisian is now in
his seventh year, and though, being a gelding, he
may remain a while longer in his racing prime, the
chances are he will be on the down-grade next
spring. He might have won this coming Cup, but
he can’t continue for ever to be the “best horse in
Australia on his day.” He had two days only in
the past 27 months, during which he ran 16 times,
and was 12 times unplaced. His other performances
were two thirds and two wins—Australian Cup and
Melbourne Cup. A very unsatisfactory record for
the best Cup horse in Australia.
* * * *
A record for close finishes was estab-
lished at Randwick last Saturday, which, for a one-
day six-event programme, will take a powerful lot
of beating. The two-mile Hurdle Race was won by
a length, the l-j-rnile Trial Stakes by about two ; the
Derby by three-quarters of a length ; the Epsom by
half a neck ; the Spring Stakes, 1J mile, w.f.a., re-
sulted in a dead heat, and the Kensington Handicap
of seven furlongs was won by half a length. And
then, if such closeness were not sufficient provoca-
tion of heart disease, relaxed throat and bunions on
the brain, the three principal events produced three
successive shocks of the specially irritant sort.
When it wasn’t the case of an outsider dashing out
of the ruck and gaining fast upon the well-backed
one nearly home, it was a short-priced nag bounding
from the rear after an apparently-winning favorite.
Thus, when Cider (Derby second favorite at four to
one against) passed Woiowa and Elystan inside the
distance, he looked safe enough to ease up and walk
in, but —“Cripes! Look at Harpist!” Hunter
White’s Sir Tristram-Choir Girl chestnut came so
fast from nowhere over those last few hundred yards,
that the followers of Cider shook in their shoes
until .their moke caught the judge’s eye—with
Harpist nearly at his girths.' And yet Harpist w.ent
out at 50 to one in that field of 13, and had he re-
peated the Tanami trick of two years ago, it would
have been severe punishment indeed for the fickle
crowd that forget how, only one short month ago, he
had dead-heated for second place in the Canterbury
Park Handicap. Shock No. 2 was the heavily-gilded
Epsom. Here, the Sydney familiar Gigandra (Ibex-
Mira), looking a picture of perfect condition, passed
the runaway Blairgour at the distance, and being a
very popular and widely-tipped third favorite after
Jolly Beggar and Popinjay, was vociferously greeted
as he came sailing majestically homewards, a cert, of
all certs. “But, holy Caster! Look at Hartfell!”
With a long, long run, and a strong, strong whip,
W. 11. Smith, the “Flogsring Finisher,” brought Mer-
ton’s alleged Metropolitan ‘‘good chance” (but
Epsom 25 to one against outsider), bounding along
to pip Gigandra in the last breath by half a neck.
Thgt shock was much worse and more enduring in
its. effects. No. 3 was yet another variety of shock.
This time, in the Spring Stakes, the 20 to one shot,
Aurofodina, owned by the same old Merton, and
steered by the long ex-Maorilander, W. Barnett,
cleared out from his nine classy opponents, and was
apparently romping home. When arose the cry,
“Lord save me soul! Look at Duke Foote!” Here,
for a change, was a three to one second favorite
swooping down like a storm on an outsider. At the
half-distance, “the Duke” was up with the Flavus
horse, but the other responded with just as mightv
an effort, and together down the straight thev fought
with Fate, and each caught a different judicial eve
simultaneously. Once every five years is often enough
for the occurrence of four such crowded hours of
suspense and shock. And they call it pleasure and
sport! Ye gods !
* * * *
“The Mug” whoops loudly, and, not alto-
gether without reason: “Mighty is the Law of
Averages, and behold, it hath prevailed! In last
week’s issue I warned the brethren of the sacred
order of the Punters that when a handicap is open—
aye, as wide as the pocket of a Freetrade news-
paper for 50 per cent, protect'on—as Saturdav’s
Epsom was, then the average winning weight was the
best guide a reasonable man might follow. Likewise
1 told how the average winning weight for 27 Epsoms
w*- 7st. 111 b. and a fraction. Hartfell, with 7st.
121 b,, was the nearest to it, with Biairgour, Sand-
bath and Malthusian on the 7st. 101 b. mark, and that
the winner would most likely come from that lot.
And yet Hartfell went out at 25’s and
won, with Biairgour third. No other scribe
even hinted at this nag, ‘He was only
going for the Metrop.,’ you know! But the
Law of Averages is no respecter of horse scribes.
Now, give ear 1 As to the Cups: Of 34 Caulfield
Cups run in 33 years—there were two in 1881 —
two must be ignored, as the distance in each was less
than the present one and a half mile ; and in one of
the other 32 years there was a dead-heat between
Bst. 91b. and Bst. lib. Counting that as one winner
with Bst. 51b., the average of the two added, 32
winners carried over one and a half miles 248 st 131 b.,
giving ap average winning weight of 7st. 101 b., and
nearly all of another pound. The nearest to the aver-
age at time of writing are Duke Foote, Eric, Bridge,
Posadas, Barlow, Havocorn —all at 7st. 111 b. Of
the 51 Melbourne Clips, five were won in early years
with less than the present 6st. 71b. minimum, and,
therefore, cannot be reckoned. The winners of the
other 46 humped 3645 t. 71b., which yields the aver-
age winning weight of the Melbourne Cup as 7st.
121 b., and nearly enough ounces to make another
pound. Bobadea and Danaus have 7st. 121 b., Seon-
ser, Matouree and Posadas have 7st. 131 b. Penalised
nags will, of course, drop out of the above groups—
and you takes your choice and pays your hard-earned
gilt.

The serial story of two owners and three
horses (one of which is a mare) was f rtbcr advanced
at Randwick on Saturday. Apple Pie, when raced
by Agar Wynne, ran into a place in the V.A.T.C.
Debutante Stakes, A.J.C. Doncaster and Epsom,
Caulfield, Melbourne and Australian Cups. When the
Ayr Laddie-Praleen mare retired, Wynne had hopes
of the Ayr Laddie-Light Heart horse, Hartfell, but
that noble steed in two successive seasons ran 10
seconds or thirds., winning but thrice, his best race
being the Moonee Valley Cup. So Wynne sold him
to Merton last November for 800 guineas, and trans-
ferred his sadly-abused trust and confidence to bis
two-year-old colt, Cider, despite the fact that he was
full brother to Apple Pie. Last season Cider won
three times and was twice second. On Saturday he
won the A.J.C. Derby for Wynne, and the next race,
the Epsom, was won by Wynne’s cast-off, Hartfell,
for Merton, who had scored wifh him a few weeks
previously at first time of asking. It is now up to
Wynne to have is lucky as well as good.
Mostly the men who sail along cheerfully
the morning after the race and ostentatiously pay the
tram fares of everybody thev know on the carj and
announce that they “won 50 quid on the Epsom,
but lost 20 of it on the last race,” are the ones who
were skinned clean. There were some men who did
win money by Hartfell’s victory, but thev didn’t
back him on the course. They were Parramatta
N.S.W. citizens, friends of aviator Hart, and when
the terrific smash occurred at Richmond, they saw
the tip, rushed into the betting club, and foremost
fell on Christian Galilee at long odds.
* * * •
Although there were four falls in the
Metropolitan to bring confusion on prophets and
punters, Duke Foote, the animal that carried the
public money at evens, in addition to 7st. 101 b. of
human meat and muscle, kept clear of the mix-up,
and justified the faith that was in him. Still,
Brown’s Piastre, with 7st. 61b. up, and Shuja, with
7st. (including penalties), made a game running.
But the Duke was It. The great crash took place at
the nine-furlong post, and Hartfell, Irish Figure,
Ocean Blue and Simla were spread out over the
course when they and the Duke were all running
level- Shuja went to the front, and Blakeney emerged
from the disorder (or upheaval of Ulster) and beat
Piastre for second place in the reformed procession.
The rest were more or less bunched together, with
Duke Foote on the outside, increasing his pace under
moral and physical suasion. So they travelled for
another three furlongs, when Blakeney begari to
fail, and at five furlongs to go Piastre took his place,
with Shuja making a furious exhibition in frdnt.
Still under suasion, Duke Foote galloped into third
place—on the outside; and into the straight they
happened, or wandered, or fled, or drifted, or flew.
Piastre appeared alongside Shuja, with Daniius, Duke
Foote and Ladies’ Man all bunched together, close
behind. Then Shuja fell back, and Duke Foote ap-
peared alongside Piastre, and they passed the Leger
together. The Duke was drawing away, inch by inch,
and the roar of the Gentile made the heart of Ikev
Aloysios stand still. Then Piastre came again, but
the Duke, responding to whin and spur, landed the
bacon with four lengths to snare, in 2min. 344 sec—
. faster than Malt King’s record of fast year.
Ladies’ Man was a length behind, second,; Piastre
third. But the right horse was in the right place,
for Shuja had gone out at anv old price at all, and
so had Ladies’ Man, while Piastre was good enough
for 10’s and Duke Foote’s for evens.
*** * ' i
Pnke Foote’s win of the Metrop. and Ins
dead-heat in the Spring Stakes sets at rest any lin-
gering doubts about the . soundness of the brute’s
understandings: Both races were over 14 miles, and
although there may be all sorts of doubts about the
prad’s willingness to step out Over two miles in the
bumping match known as the Melbourne Cup, the
Duke showed clear heels to the talent in the Metrop.,
and looked capable of running indefinitely. Parties
who have staked their monetary redemption on the
Duke’s chances in the Melbourne Cup, therefore,
have no reason to lose any sleep over the animal's
ability to account for the same herd that straggled
behind him in the Metrop.—so long as plenty Of
suasion is applied. But' there are others.
The Duke’s easy four-length win on Mon-
day has apparently hypnotised the horse reporter
and deprived him of the requisite degree of horse
sense to look at the matter from both sides and the
top and the bottom, and the other two sides. The
general chorus is now that it “is only a matter of
keeping well” for the Sir Foote-Ortelle horse to win
both Cups in a more or less leisurely style. Per-
haps he will —but pprbaps lie won’t. Writer's
opinion is that he will win neither Cup. Certainly coal-
baron John Brown's nag has done all he has been
asked to since he returned to action after 11 months’,
retirement. But his three wins and a dead-heat in
four starts were sometimes from fifth-raters and
sometimes from good ones that were either unripe
or unwilling. His dead heat in the A.J.C. Spring
Stakes, lj miles w.f.a., last Saturday was with
Aurofodina, who wasn't in the first nine in the
Chelmsford Stakes. Monday’s Metrop. saw him
spread-eagle a crowd of which some half dozen will
be a lot more eager for the fray by Cup-time at
Caulfield or Flemington, or both. The Duke, in
fact, was “ready early,” and has been out to win
every time in Sydney, while some of his opponents
have been ready but waiting for Melbourne, and some
have been running into form for the larger carnival
with the wider markets. The A.J.C. Spring meet-
ing is not the final goal of all Sydney owners and
trainers. And the Duke has to neet some Victorian
neddies of class who did not Join in the glorified
preliminary canter at Randwick. With 7st. 111 b.
and 7st. 71b. in the Cups, neither race was a “moral”
for him, but now that penalties lift his load to Bst.
11-lb. in the Caulfield, and to Bst. 31b. in the Mel-
bourne Mug, he compares more unfavorably than
ever with some of the others. In fact, each Cup
teems with probable conquerors of J. Brown’s moke.
And last, but far from least, there’s always the like-
lihood of a beast that carries tons of bullion being
pocketed, bumped and otherwise outed by one or
more that have no “earthly” themselves, but just
happen to be there for that express purpose. That
“prohibitive price” the average horse reporter bleats
about generally prohibits him having a fair run or
much choice.
* * * *
Just consider this howling, joke. On the
morning of October 1 seven Sydney trainers
(some prominent veterans among them) were so pre-
occupied with the trial races for two-year old’s that
rosy morning, and with Other preparations for the
Randwick gamble, that they forgot all about the
closing of the V.R.C. general entries that day.
Consequently the Allsop, Kelso, Scully, Rayner,
Burton, Tillett and Knight stables won’t be repre-
sented in any of the numerous “minor” events at
Flemington. Randwick-mad Sydney Daily Tele-
graph on October 5 snorts:—
“The penny-wise and pound-foolish system adopted
by the V.R.C. has been responsible for leaving
Messrs. H. Rayner, IV. Kelso, J. Tillett, J. Allsop,
J. Burton, E. H. Knight and T. Scully without a
representative in the minor races at the next Spring
meeting. The fact that the general entries were
to close on Tuesday last was not notified by the
club here, and in consequence the engagement was
unknown to the owners and trainers named. That
interest in the V.R.C. minor races must suffer by
the absence of representatives of the stables presided
over by the trainers named is obvious, and it behoves
the V.R.C. to be less cheeseparing in future. The
experience is too unpleasant to be courted again, for,
in addition to the loss of perhaps 50 or 60 entries,
th,e horses that would have been entered will not go
to Melbourne, and it is probable that their owners
and trainers, as well as their regular supporters, will
stay at home also.”
The “penny-wise and pound-foolish system” is, of
course, a gibe at the fact that the VJi.C. did not
advertise the date of the closing of the entries in
the Sydney papers. As a matter of fact, the Tele-
graph itself, on September 30, announced that first
forfeit for the Victorian Derby was due next day.
And the Australian trainer who forgets that the
general entries always close on the same day as the
Derby first forfeit is likely at any time to forget
to put a moke under his jockey before sending the
mannikin to the post.
* * * *
Many noble Romans —that is, sports, as
distinct from mere gamblers—consider that next Sat-
urday’s A.J.C. programme holds the choicest item of
the week’s flutter, for then will Trafalgar be seen in
action over two miles in the Randwick Plate. The
champion grandson of Carbine is now seven years
old. He won the R.P. at four, five and six years,
the last with 9st. 71b. up, in 2inin. 27sec. This is
bracketed as the Australian two-mile record with
Tartan’s Sydney Cup. But it should not be, for
Tartan carried only 7st. 131 b. After his last Rand-
wick Plate Trafalgar ran 15th in the Melbourne Cup
with 9st. 91b., but he had a worse passage than was
recorded, and this year, despite all his great record,
he has got in at 9st. 121 b. A fact that is worth re-
membering when weighing Duke Foote’s chances.
Unless the jockey is in the front rank
(and Lord knows how he gets there) scant praise is
wasted on him. Thus the S. M. Herald on the
7/10/’l2. “Both the owner and trainer of the Derby
winner on Saturday were warmly congratulated on
the result of the race.” Apparently, jockey P. F.
Foley is regarded as plain Mud. It was Foley’s
second mount in the A.J.C. Derbies, and of the 13
riders in Saturday’s tussle only R. W. Lewis and
\V. 11. Smith bore him company as steerers of win-
ners.
* * * #
Adelaide Hunt Cup this year went to
owner Kirby, M.F.H. in the Mount Gambier district
—S.A.’s “south-east.” Maxmillion and Texas were
most fancied, but Kirby’s Promoter came home alone,
and paid the useful dividend of £6 12s. in a field of
six. Weather warm and dusty—the first touch of
soring. In a smaller race, there was a dividend
of £73 ss. The Tote does hand out money gaily
when it gets going.
There was nothing interesting about the
S.A. football season except the end of it, and that
was due to the sporting but dubiously equitable way
they have under Australian rules. The top four
clubs on the season’s results play off in two “semi-
finals” and a final to see who shall be premiers.
Port Adelaide had not been beaten all winter, but
was reputedly getting stale, and also had several men
on the damaged list. West Adelaide had started the
season horribly, but was improving every week, and
had come a bad second. When they met in the final
West won, thanks to an amazing burst of seven goals
in the third quarter, and, also, perhaps, to a dislo-
cated jaw acquired by one of Port’s best men soon
after play started. Port’s first-on-the-season gave it
a right of challenge, but West , won again on the
second time of asking. Now people are beginning to
query the system. A team that can beat another
twice within a week is clearly the better side —at the
time. On the other hand, West lost five games out
of 15, and Port only two —the above two—out of
15. Yet the former are premiers. As the public
gets three (or four, this year) exciting extra
matches, and the clubs get lots of useful gate money,
the semi-final and final system is not likely to be
dropped. Yet it looks fairly rotten.
The Melbourne Cricket Club’s severalth
attempt to enter the pennant competition along
with the other 12 district clubs has once more come
to naught; The V.C.A. offered to give it a common
district with East Melbourne (which was rough on
East) ; let it keep its present players and take 10
juniors from other clubs (names of the 10 to be
stated) ; and pick and play public school pupils for
a period of five years—provided it gave up its
special representation on the Board of Control—
and the M.C.C. couldn’t see it. If the V.C.A. had
nous enough to fix up a genuine scheme of district
or electorate cricket, giving a fair chance to the
most junior team to work its way steadily to the
top, instead of confining the competition to the 12
clubs year after year, it would probably make dis-
trict cricket so popular that the M.C.C., as a cricket
club, would become a scoff and a by-word.
The cricket devotees of Sydney had an
elegant afternoon on which to complete the firsi
round of matches, in spite of the rain that splashed
down in bucket-sized drops on the Friday afternoon.
The wickets rolled out excellently; and both bats-
men and bowlers did well on them, the bowlers
having the advantage. Among the individual bats-
men, H, Cooper, of North Sydney, was easily best
with 110. S. Moore, of the same club, 81; Rev. E.
F. Waddy, of Parramatta, 71; and J. H. Bosward, of
Paddington, 59, all helped to make glory for the
willow-wielders. Among the bowlers, J. D. Scott,
of Petersham, was absolutely sensational, taking, on
the afternoon, six wickets for nine runs, and on the
whole innings seven for 27. H. Dupain, of Bur-
wood, rooked in seven for 65, which, though good,
was not sensational. Below that nothing was worth
special mention. The matches panned out thus:
University, which declared with seven wickets down
for 369, easily beat Waverley (133 and seven for
123) by 236 runs on the first innings. North Sydney
was too good for Central Cumberland (otherwise
Parramatta), with 280 for seven wickets (declared)
to 140 and four for 197, by 140 on the first innings.
Paddington smacked up 251 to Sydney’s 215, and so
got home with 36 to spare on the first innings. Bur-
wood, having compiled 197 and declared with five
for 84, failed to do more than secure a first innings’
win from Middle Harbor, which accumulated 124 and
six for 103. Glebe, having bashed 231 and lost one
wicket for 42, overthrew Balmain with 202 by 29
runs on the first innings. Petersham piled up 196
and 133 to Gordon’s 108, looked over the grass arid
remarked that as it was 88 to the good on the first

even so it was. - *
The hoofball season having been buried.
Victoria’s “flannelled fools” on Saturday betook
themselves to the various grounds and began wallop-
ing a small ball with a large waddy. The premier
club, Northcote, received East Melbourne, from whose
captaincy Peter McAlister has Just retired, and was
putting its men in and out in short order when the
gates of Heaven opened and stayed the slaughter,
East had lost six wickets for 139 when proceedings
were adjourned till next Saturday, in the hope, on
the part of East, that the moisture would continue;
on the part of ’Cote that it wouldn’t. In all the
games the skipper who won the toss went to the
wickets—and was speedily very sorry for doing so,
for unless the rain is repeated next week-end his
position is almost hopeless. EsSendon encountered
South’s fast bowler, ex-Tasmanian Facy, on his day
out and lost six wickets to him for 38. The resusci-
tated inter-Stater, J. F. Giller, took the other four.
Total, a miserable 80. St. Kilda had accumulated
28 for one wicket when the dampness drove it off
the ground. ’Roy’s bowlers, Cannon and Boulter,
ran through P’ran, even as a motor sprints through
a flock of sheep, for 79 ; Carlton toilsomely put to-
gether 103 for nine against ’Varsity, and ’Wood
made 108 for five against Melbourne, but this latter
game, not counting for the pennant, was, in effect, a
mere practice match.
Balmain struck its first great disaster in
the Soccer competitions on Saturday in the final
struggle of the season for the coveted Rawson Cup,
which would, had it won, have become its exclusive
property. Sydney put a very solid defensive team
into the field, and Balmain dashed itself to pieces
against the solidity thereof. The first half ended
without either team scoring, and then both went bare-
sark, taking turn about at attack. Sydney carried
one of its attacks through and scored. After that
it laid itself out to prevent Balmain equalising, arid
succeeded, so Sydney won the Rawson Cm by one
goal to nil. The defeated team is said to have been
almost afraid to return home. This ends First Grade
football for the season.
The new boat Kismet, mentioned in this
column last week, was not long in landing its share
of the plunder, which was duly appropriated on Sat-
urday last in the Sydney Sailing Club’s 18ft. handi-
cap. And it won by extra special sailing and craft-
manship, in one of the hardest races ever seen on
Sydney’s Beautiful. That past-master, G. Holmes,
landed the sturdy fighting boat Donnelly into the
second place 12see. behind Kismet and Bsec. ahead of
Nimrod.

This year’s substitute for the great Warr-
nambool road race, the rush for the Dunlop gold cup,
happened on Saturday over the 116 miles from
Camperdown to Footseray. Of the 229 entrants 164
started in rain and sleet, but with a fresh south-
westerly wind behind them. The limit men got away
at 8.30 a.m., and 45min. later C. Snell, D. Kirkham
and G. W. Bell left from scratch. Nothing of note
happened till, at 1.36 p.m., S. G. Perrett, of Cam-
perdown, with 22min. start, reached the smellful
suburb, 32sec. ahead of limit man E. Barrie, of
Richmond. Twelfth man in was C. Snell, of Euroa,
who covered the distance in 4hr. 53min. 55sec. —a
record for the distance. An unfortunate item, re-
mindful of last year’s Warrnambool bother, was the
lodging of a protest by Barrie against Perrett for
availing himself of the “pace” of a motor-bike be-
tween Werribee and Melbourne. At latest the Road
Board, which managed the affair, had not decided
the issue.
The second edition of J. J. Miller’s
Sporting Pamphlet came to hand this year some-
what earlier than usual. It has sometimes been de-
layed until the conclusion of the A.J.C. meeting, but
the extra edition in this case closes the list of Cup
horse performances at September 25, and states a
number of sporting “records,” which have been
created during the three months since the Pamphlet
was published. To the making of records there is no
end.

Not looking for trouble, but pos-
sessing that quiet confidence to look
after yourself when trouble does not
come your way.
You admire the pluck of a man who
takes a beating from the experienced
boxer. But do you admire his awk-
wardness, or the way he leaves him-
self open, or how he punches the air,
or the blackened eyes that advertise
his downfall for days afterwards? Or
do you admire watching the man who
plants his blows where they sting,
who evades wild rushes, and who
comes out of the fray unscathed?
Which part do you play? And
which part are you going to play in
future?

DUNLOP RUBBER CO.. *ll Statei & N.Z.
“Side Lights” : I suppose the passengers
of the Kaipara who have return tickets are
wishing hard that there was some way of
walking back from Auckland. Off the Aus-
tralian coast a S.S.W. wind brought a
boisterous beam sea on them, and the waves
commenced to Climb aboard and remove
everything that was removable and some
that wasn’t. The wind increased in the
night, and next day the seas set to work to
try and pull the ship to little pieces. The
steam-pipe casings were torn out by the
roots and the pipes wreathed round the
hatch coverings. The surgery door sus-
tained compound fractures and amputation,
and the surgery, the saloon and the officers’
quarters had a severe attack of water on the
brain and the best carpets. The doors in
the passage-ways vanished in splinters be-
fore the seas which galloped through them.
The gangway lashed to the side was pounded
into pieces, and the decks and chart-house
bombarded with the flying fragments, and
some more seas boiled through the saloon
and the ladies’ cabin. Then the skylights
were smashed, and a few more tons of damp
water fell through the roof. In the end
even the boastful traveller who is never sick
and loves sea journeys, wasn’t any sorry
when the ship crawled into port on the other
side with one lame leg and its ear in a sling.
It is a sad business sitting in a jolting
cab which is following a dead mate’s hearse
to the place of headstones. It is, in fact,
the only thing one true friend does grudg-
ingly for another. But it is terrible to
spend a sunny afternoon funeralising, under
the impression that an old chum is at the
head of the procession, and, later, to be in-
formed that a mistake has been made, and
that you have squandered your grief on a.
stranger. A Bulletin man lately had this
experience; and now he doesn’t know whe-
ther to be glad that his friend is alive, or
wild because he can’t be recompensed for
his wasted time and grief. The long arm
of coincidence was partly responsible. An
invalid friend was an inmate of a public in-
stitution in Sydney, and the same place
contained a total stranger who own'ed tire
same Christian and surname. The total
stranger died, and the wrong relatives arid
friends were notified. The burial was over
before the error was discovered. Sydney
has had one or two experiences of the sariie
kind recently, and people are seriously con-
sidering whether it would not be better to
abolish the crowning nuisance of life and all
its vyoeful apourtenarices. The chief thing io
be considered is: Can crowded Sydney do
without death? The general impression
seems to be that it can’t.
“Chudah” : Are the Jews disappearing, o r
going to vanish, or anything like that?’’
The pros for it are strong, and I haven't
met one lonely con. Two high German Jew-
ish authorities, Zollschau and Ruppin, agree
that Jacob is rapidly fading. Ruppin says
the vanishment can be stopped, but probably
won’t. Zollschau is certain that nothing
can stay the downward run to a cheerless
finish. When machinery and associated
capital collared the world, Judah collared
the capital and blossomed, sprouted w
otherwise; boomed. With the adoption «f
local dress, language and- customs, rever-
ence for old traditions began to go. Then
followed intermarriage with the Gentile, ami
the ruin came faster. First of all, only
Jewish women wedded the stranger. This
was a great Rothschild principle. Rothn-
children of the female sort could man v
Prime Ministers and Dukes and things, bint
males must select brides of the tent of
Jacob. Other Jews went further than tk«e
big financial family, and couldn’t see tic
use of a lot of cash if it wouldn’t buy tine
right to have any sort of girl whom the
owner might select. As a result, Ruppin
now writes: “We are in the last desperate
struggle avainst annihilation.”

THESE FAMOUS CATTLE
are then to be sold by Public Auction outright, and
WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST RESERVE. Every
animal must go!
203 FEMALE STUD HEREFORDS.
A LARGE NUMBER OF STUD BULLS.
THESE MAGNIFICENT CATTLE, founded upon
Mr. JAMES STUCKEY’S renowned Te Rangitumau
Herd, are practically all eligible for entry in the
English Herd Book.
They cannot be surpassed in the World for EVEN-
NESS OF TYPE, CONSTITUTION, EARLY MA-
TURITY, and GRAND RICH DARK COLOR.
THE TE RANGITUMAU-BUSHY PARK HERD
have had a memorable career. For many years they
have carried all before them in the Fat Classes, and
have more than held their own in the Stud Sections.
This is their
WONDERFUL SHOW RECORD!
Between November, 1905, and March, 1912, they
secured in the Stud Classes no less than 47 CHAM-
PIONSHIPS, 100 FIRST PRIZES, 48 SECONDS, and
19 THIRDS.
In the Fat Classes they were awarded 210 FIRST
PRIZES, 139 SECONDS, and 57 THIRDS.
The following are a few of the
TROPHIES WON BY THESE FINE
CATTLE—
Manawa Bowl, twenty guineas, won outright, most
points in Fat Cattle at Masterton.
Special at Hawera for Yearling Stud Hereford Bull.
Messrs. Barraud and Abraham’s trophy, £lO 10s.,
most points in Fat Cattle, at Manawatu; won out-
right several times.
Champion Prize, presented by Messrs. Pitt, Son
and Badgery, for Best Fat Ox, any age or breed, at
Sydney, 1909. The same bullock also won First
Prize for Hereford Fat Ox —any age—and the Cham-
pionship for Heaviest Ox on the Show Grounds. He
was only six years old !
A steer shown by Mr. Moore won outright a piece
of Silver Plate, presented by Hereford Association,
for best two-year-old Hereford Steer, also for best
three-year Steer (Hereford), shown at Wanganui,
Manawatu, and Masterton, 1911-12.
The cattle have been notably successful in Freez-
ing and Shop-bulloclt classes, thus showing their
qualities of EARLY MATURITY.

Scrubbing the surface of
the teeth with powders or pastes
does not thoroughly cleanse them;
it leaves their condition and that

“The Heathen”: There is no vanity like
the vanity of the new mission-made saint
with his Bible on his knee and a holy radi-
ance illuminating his spectacles and well-
soaped countenance. I have before me a
religious publication which contains the
photograph of a chimney-sweep in his work-
ing clothes, with his brushes by his side.
He is without spectacles and looks useful,
but is labelled “drunken.” On the next page
is the portrait of a scrubbed and scoured
individual, who, apparently, has just been
drinking deeply of the Word through
glasses. There are no brushes by his side,
and he is garbed in his best clothes. Also, he
is not labelled “drunken.” He isn’t even
marked “short-sighted—unfit for further
sweeping.” Here is the glassed-in saint —
the finished product of salvation arranged
for exhibition. No explanation is vouch-
safed as to whether he blunted his eyesight
with liquor or damaged it with the small
print of the good Book. It doesn’t even say
if he was saved by prodding something re-
sembling the Devil out of a chimney after
a specially lurid night with his old friend
the Drink Demon. A house cat can give a
pretty good imitation of the Devil if
prodded hard enough, and it is quite pos-
sible that it was some dissolute roof prow-
ler that shocked the flue brusher into doing
his smirk in front of a camera.

Emulsion
" Mummie, can I have my Scott’s now?”
Thus do the little ones learn to love
the emulsion that gives them stamina,
sturdiness and strength. Doctors
everywhere recommend Scott’s Emul-
sion. Nurses praise it. Mothers tell
how it made their children strong-
enabled them to overcome the many
ailments of childhood. These are a
few of hundreds of letters received.
COLDS—a mother’s proof
“ My son teas subject to severe chest colds.
He obtained relief from the first dose of
Scott’s Emulsion and the colds are now a
thing of the past. He looks the picture
of health and likes Scott’s Emulsion so
much. ” Mrs. L. G. Sheridan, 25 Bendigo

TEETHING TROUBLES
“ She suffered greatly while teething and
I was advised to give her Scott’s Emul-
sion. She improved wonderfully after
taking the contents of one bottle, and
instead of being restless and fretful,
she is now a bright, healthy child.”

Newtown, Sydney, N.S.W. 23.6.11,
DELICATE CHILD
" Her health was completely wrecked. 1
gave her Scott’s Emulsion, and from the
commencement there was a wonderful im-
provement. She now looks quite a dif-
ferent child and is strong and in all ways
healthy.” Mrs. Margaret Fraser, 4,

HOW “ANTINEURASTHIN”
REMEDIES NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.
It is, in the first place, essentially a food—not a
drug stimulant.
It is a food that feeds the whole of the nervous
system with those elements the lack of which ih the
structural tissues constitutes the neurasthenic con-
dition.
It is so easily assimilated that in one hour it is
fully absorbed, thus creating quickly a renewed
mental and physical vigor. This is not mere stimu-
lation, but is really the sensation produced by the
actual assimilation and storage of those refined ele-
ments necessary to nerve comfort and vigor. This
is not—as in the ease of tonics and stimulants—a
mere transient whipping up, but an actual addition
to the nerve structure and nerve strength of the in-
dividual. A FREE trial

A Weekly Reader of The Bulletin : If
you really believe in disarmament and trusting your
neighbors, don’t stay in Australia. Go and live in
Poland or Korea. Both these countries disarmed, or
neglected to arm, when they were independent, and
they seem to have been sorry ever since. Or if you
insist on living in Australia, start a movement
for the abolition of the police. Then, if we find we
can trust our own people, we may go further, and
abolish our military and naval forces, and trust
foreign peoples. .. .Peninko: Your suggestion that
Austerholm should be the name of Australia’s capital
is under consideration. But what is the matter with
The Bulletin’s old proposition of Kangaroosalem,
which combines our best local animal with a faint
suggestion re the person we have, borrowed such a
heap of money from. And loemu might be appro-
priate. It is a beautiful combination of our leading
bird and our notable unpaid bill. . . .C.A.M.: The
violin “branded on the inside of the back, ‘Antinous
Straduvarous, made in the year 1189/ ” is undoubt-
edly the work of Bill Smith, of Birmingham, or
Silas P. Rabbittutch, of Chicago (U.S.), or some
careless and illiterate impostor of that sort. The
violin-maker of Cremona spelt his name Antonio
Stradivari, and Death ended his labors in 1737....
L.S.K.: Can’t make out what you’re growling about.
To anyone who has had experience of the legal shark
either’ here or in the U.K., the charges you quote
appear so mild as to be almost fair and reasonable.
.... Suburbanite: The present scribe owns a first-
class ticket, and he rides second-class a good part
of the time for the sake of space. The ordinary
suburban train consists of 11 carriages—two firsts
and nine seconds ; and about 9 a.m. the first looks
like Sheol when the fire broke out and all the
demons rushed to the door and found it jammed.
(The door opened inwards.).... Old Digger: Thanks
for interesting libel. Most of those that reach us
are as dull as a suburban sermon. ... 0.P.8.L.: As
you don’t offer a single figure in contravention of
thpse which The Bulletin offered, but merely sup-
ply seven pages of loose declamation, you are hereby
written down as an ignorant and abusive ass... .
A Bit: Certainly. On the other hand, why not cut
down Australian wages to the English level, so that
Australia can make calico without putting on an
extra penny a yard ? The idea of the Labor Free-
trader is (1) that the Australian artisan should get
twice as much for his work as the English one ; and
(2) that he shouldn’t get any work at all unless he
can compete with the cheap English artisan, or wiui
still cheaper artisans.... Sir Octopus: “Pride and
Passion” doesn’t suggest things like that. Pride,
according to you, is a nice girl, who is rather deli-
cate and dislikes sunburn.... Frank Pemberton: “The
Ruby Ring” is a story about nothing, which ends no-
where. .. .Luke Warm: But why do the “white cows
wade all fat” ? Can’t they jump over it, or sidestep it,
or something?.. . .P.L.W.: A person who writes “lappy
lairs,” and expects us to print it as “jumpy liars’ 5 or
“happy hours,” or some other old way, is too care-
less to boil a potato satisfactorily, let alone make
verses on “Bobbin’s Head.”. . .R.H.: Send us some of
the “golden flouring rhime” when it arrives. .. .
Tingiri: “The Queen of the Sea” is correct, dull
verse, which any intelligent person could turn out
to the extent of about 700 stanzas a day. . . .Lothaire:
Catalogue received. “Manly’s lovely shore” noted.
Also that “pleasant scenes the fainting trav’ller
tease.” No use .Eraticus: Too dull even for scorn-
ful quotation.... Errant: Fleas not lively enough.
!We put them back... .H.C.F.: Moved by the office
Wowser, seconded by the Religious Editor, and car-
ried with enthusiasm, that your insult to “Four
Sisters” be, and is herewith, damned R.N.C.:
“Storm and Calm” unsuitable. . . .Hazy: No hope. .. .
L.T.H.: “The Prospectors” is too slight. .. .Amikus:
Cheerful verse until it begins to be obscurely ob-
scene. One small slab: —
O my girl’s a Bonzer
a snifter a Snorter
a peach and a gem of
The verry first Water
Her hair is like silk
And her eyes like the sea
her skin is like the milk
That you put in your tea.
In fact, we are willing to accept the statement that
the color of the lady didn’t differ much from that
of the sort of milk that you give to the cat
Manin: Good enough imitation of Fitzgerald, but no
use. ... .C.8.P.: Don’t know much about bending
glass, but we can give you a recipe for plum sauce
or a cure for rheumatism, if those are any use to
you. We have also a lot of ideas (rejected) about
snails, worms, crocodiles, politicians and things, that
you can have if you want them. If you really must
bend that glass, perhaps you could do it with a
t hammer; but better ask the publican next d00r....
| J.F.C.: Alleged pars, appear to be about nothing at
! all. .. .E.W.O’D.: That broken glass yarn is a good
j one. Hadn’t seen it for years until your paragraph
! arrived. .. .G.W.G. (V.): Fearfully sorry, but we are
! too busy to attend to such matters. Try a religious
I publication. .. .Amateur' (Iyalgoorlie, W.A.) : Gladly
seize the opportunity of passing the query on. Does
anyone know a recitation entitled, “The Face on the
Floor?” “Amateur” says that it tells how a great
but sodden artist sketches the women he loved next
to beer on the bar-room f100r... .John A.: There are
faint gleams in it, but you lack skill. .. .S.Y. (W.A.) :
You did well not to attach your name and address.
If you had supplied these particulars, The Bulle-
tin's Stipendiary Cannibal would have tracked you
across your native sandhills until he sighted your
camp. Then, in the cold light of some merciless
dawn, he would have stolen upon you and insisted on
your taking the poem back....M.D. (Q.) : But sup-
posing that you “climbed Ambition’s pinnacle to j
place and power,” and found the pinnacle too sharp :
to sit on? Anyhow, the person who gets up a pin-
nacle would need an arm like a deep-sea sounding-

The Jenolan Caves.
No traveller, however extensive his field, may have been, can claim a
complete education until he lias visited the Jenolan Caves.
The Jenolan Caves present a display of bewildering beauty to the
sightseer; the limestone crystals —of which the stalactites are
formed—sparkling and glittering like myriads of jewels in the rays
of the electric light.
In the early days, the Caves were only reached after a hard, rough
journey over bush tracks —now, one may step into a Motor at
Mount Victoria, and be whirled through picturesque gorges, over
good roads, completing the inspection of the Caves within a few
hours.
Mount Victoria —the nearest Railway Station to the Caves
attracts Tourists from all parts of the World. It is the centre of
many famous Beauty Spots, and is the radiating point of all the
Mountain Sights.
qq ie “IMPERIAL HOTEL,” Mount Victoria, stands second to none
for comfort and convenience. The furnishings are thoroughly
up to date; the lighting coming from the “IMPERIAL’S” own
plant; self-contained Sanitary System and Water Supply, and the
most modern Garage outside Sydney; excellent Service and first-
class Cuisine. Summer Tariff, from November to April —10/- per
day; £3/3/- per week. Winter Tariff, from May to October —10/-
per day; £2/10/- per week.
MOTOR
SERVICE
TO THE
CAVES.
Between the “IMPERIAL HOTEL” a]l( ] the Caves,
a fine daily Service of “Itala” Cars is maintained.
These Cars —famous for their power and speed—
leave in the morning, and return in time to catch
the afternoon train to the City.
Return fare to the Caves, 30/-

Sir Charles A. Cameron, C. 8.,
M.D., etc.,
writes: “Takingan interest in all
subjects relating to food, I have
procured samples of Sanatogen
and subjected them to experi-
ment. . . .
“In my opinion, it is the or-
ganic phosphorus which makes
Sanatogen of such value. . . .
A series of experiments proved
that Sanatogen is easily and com-
pletely digested. I have arrived
at the conclusion that Sanatogen
is a substance of the highest
nutritive value, containing as it
does a large amount of organic
phosphorus—that is, phosphorus
which is offered to the tissues in
exactly the form in which it can
be easily absorbed. It is an ex-
cellent nerve food.”
“The Medical Times”
says: “There is no doubt what-
ever that the nutrition of patients
taking Sanatogen improves won-
derfully, due, in all probability,
to its being easy of assimilation
and to the organic absorbable
phosphorus which it contains.”
A thousand times this number of Physicians endorse
SANATOGEN
The Royal Tonic Food.
Over fourteen thousand practising physicians have recorded in writing their high
opinion of Sanatogen, and many thousands more are daily prescribing it with the
most beneficial results in cases of debility, brain fag, lack of vitality, sleepless-
ness, disordered digestion, poverty of blood and various wasting diseases.
Can you ask for more convincing testimony of Sanatogen’s value than the
fact that it is thus publicly endorsed and recommended by practically the whole
medical profession ?
Among the original letters in praise of Sanatogen which are filed for public
inspection, there are many from world-famous physicians whose names stand
for the highest scientific achievements. Their advice, and the example of
distinguished men like those mentioned here, it is safe tor you to follow.
Irresistible as this evidence is, the reader can only realise the wonderful
revivifving effects of Sanatogen by taking it himself when his nervous system
and bodily strength have been undermined by overwork, worry or disease.
WRITE TO-DAY FOR FREE HEALTH BOOK.
You can buy Sanatogen at any chemists. Write to-day for a free copy of
Dr. Andrew Wilson’s health book, “The Art of Living.” Please mention this
paper, and address your postcard to r

J 7 BOND STREET,

of Berlin University, writes: “ T
have used Sanatogen in a number
of cases, mainly of a nervous or
neurasthenic origin, and have
obtained excellent results.”
Mr. Hall Caine,
the celebrated Author and Dram-
atist, writes : “My experience
of Sanatogen has been that as a
tonic nerve food it has on more
than one occasion done me good.”
Mr. W. Rhodes,
the famous Yorkshire Cricketer,
writes: “ I have given Sanatogen
a good trial, and found it a
splendid tonic.”
Mr. A. G. Hales,
the famous War-Correspondent:
“ I find my health benefits by
everv tin of Sanatogen. It re-
vitalises a mau, and is not a
drug.”
QUEENSLAND CLIMATE SEVERE.
“This climate is so severe with changes and damp-
ness that children easily contract colds and croup,
and I am never without a bottle of Chamberlain’s
Cough Remedy,” writes Mrs. L. J. F. Holt, Denham
Street, Rockhampton, Q. “My children have been so
benefited by Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy that I
have every cause to recommend it. It always cures
and cures quickly.”*
SOME MOTH-EATEN TENETS; WITH
SPECIAL REFERENCE TO A
CENTURY-OLD PREJUDICE.
A queer feature of the Australian Labor
movement —the cause which claims to be
several miles ahead of the battle van of
progress; and which represents itself as
standing for all that the world has evolved
in the way of daring political enlighten-
ment —is its dogged adherence to various
old and utterly busted fetiches. It harbors,
not in its ranks merely, but amongst its
most trusted captains, persons who, as re-
gards many of their opinions, belong away
back in the middle of last century and
earlier. Freetraders like Federal Laborite W.
M. Hughes, and any one of a dozen prom-
inent State Laborites that might be named,
are absurd anomalies in a party which is
out to fight: for decent industrial conditions,
or, in other words, decent wages. They
worship the god of Cheapness-at-any-Price,
an Early Victorian deity which, in the
United Kingdom and elsewhere, has been
shown repeatedly to possess feet of mud.
There is no. vestige of logic in the position
they take up in this respect. They denounce
sweating with infuriated eloquence in Par-
liament, and on divers stumps, and at the
same time encourage it strenuously by op-
posing bounties, by struggling tirelessly to
lower duties, and by playing, in every other-
way within their power, the game of the im-
porter of foreign goods which have been
manufactured on a starvation basis. These
people pose as friends of the local operative.
They assure him, at election times, that the
bettering of his financial lot is among the
strongest yearnings of their collective bosom.
Yet they do their utmost to keep his wages
down by standing in the way of that Pro-
tection which, in the existing state of the
Law, is an increased preliminary to increased
wages. Many of them are anti-militarists
and Peace Society enthusiasts, of the type of
that Thinker who argued, three-quarters of
a century ago, that, if Britain would only
disband its army, and scrap its navy, the
other nations would be so edified that they
would follow suit, and thus bring about the
millennium. Nevertheless, being as illogi-
cal as Women’s League members, they re-
main Unionists, and militant ones at that.
They do not urge a scrapping of the organ-
isation that has won so much for their order
in the past, and a blind reliance on the like-
lihood of the employers behaving like gentle-
men and philanthropists without compul-
sion. They know too much. Where larjje
and more or less remote and academic
problems such as War and Fiscalism, and
the ethics of the same, are concerned, they
spout the gags of the early part of last cen-
tury with much glibness and apparent con-
viction. But they ivould not apply- such
theories to. the immediate conditions of their
everyday lives for a fortune.
5 * * * *
This tendency to cling with unreasoning
trust and affection to the ideas of another
age is evident in a dozen different directions.
Take the question of pensions.. The Labor
party is ready enough to grant pensions to
the old or the infirm — : and rightly so. But
with weird inconsequence a goodly per-
centage of its members jibs at doing any-
thing of the sort in the case of State ser-
vants. Probably not one in 19 of the op-
ponents of a system which, under modern
conditions, has everything to recommend it,
realises that this attitude is a survival of
the musty, played-out old radicalism of a
century ago. Hostility to pensions was
the hall-mark of the democrat of Geo. lll.’s
time. The plank was a sound one in that
epoch. Corruption was -rife everywhere,
and nowhere more than in Parliament. The
bestowal of pensions by the Crown, with
the flagrant object of buyidg majorities in
the House, had attained the dimensions of a
howling scandal. Practically everybody,
barring the pension-holders, the pension-
givers or bribers, and - illiterates, was bit-
terly hostile to the' systeif. Those were the
days of William Cobbett, and the “Black
Book” (wherein appeared a list of State
pensioners, and the vast sums they were
tearing off the country), and the plainest of
plain speaking. Men of the stamp of
Holyoake handed on the torch; and to-
day, paradoxically enough, it is to be ob-
served blazing cheerily in the hands of Aus-
tralian Labor Ministers. They do not
flourish it because they have given this
matter of pensions to. State servants pro-
found thought. The simple explanation is
that a lamentable number of them are Cob-
BEN-ites and that they have adopted this
grey-whiskered old reform cry, together with
the equally doddering aspirations after uni-
versal disarmament, world-wide freedom of
trade, the brotherhood -pf man, the joint
recumbency of the Lion and the Lamb, and
the foregathering of the Jaguar and the
Rabbit, and the rest of the Early Victorian
Radical’s box of tricks.
As aforesaid, such doctrines do not run
in the present century. More especially
they are meaningless in Australia. There
is not the remotest probability of the State
pension system being used by the Crown in
these parts for purposes of corruption. On
the other hand, the hardship which the ab-
sence of anything of the sort, so far as the
Federal sphere is concerned, imposes on a
large class is obvious. A glaring example
is afforded by tfle position of the High Court
Judges. VTiile the State Judge draws two-
thirds of his salary in the event of illness
or old age smiting him, his High Court rela-
tive goes into unproductive obscurity with-
out a farthing. I .Chief Justice Cullen, of
N. S. Wales, for example, is paid £3500 a
year: if he developed some incapacitating
complaint to-morrow he would have a right
to £2300 a year, or thereabouts, till he died.
The Chief Justice of Australia —a citizen
w r ho has done his country good service in
his time, and a lawyer whom B. R. Wise,
K.C., after three years’ experience of Privy
Council work in London, described as “one
of the Empire’s greatest jurists”—has the
same salary as a State Chief Justice, and
nothing whatever when he retires or fails-
in health. Surely this is all wrong. It
may be argued that £3500 a year is a big
figure—a sum on which anyone should be
able to save. But, in the nature of things,
it isn’t enjoyed for very long. The recipi-
ent, if he is anyway worthy, has probably
been earning more than that at the Bar.
He has a standard of living which he would
find it difficult to abandon, and which, in
any case, the State has no right to ask
him to abandon.- Also, he doubtless has
commitments —a house to keep up, insurances
to pay, and so forth —which leave him little
margin for drastic economy. And how dras-
tically he would require to be to. save is
plain when one considers that he would need
to put by a third of his income for 10 years,
in order to amass a capital sum that would
bring him in £450 per annum. The Aus-
tralian soldier is in an immeasurably worse
position. ' Not only is there no pension
provision for him, but he is villainously
sweated into the bargain. A salary of
£5OO a year represents almost unthinkable
wealth to 99 per cent, of the military pro-
fession. The luckless Area Officer—the man
who is responsible for the efficiency of Aus-
tralia’s embryo army—has to do his duty
and elude the Insolvency Court on £3 a
week, a wage which many a navvy can knock
out without undue effort. The £5OO-a-year
man is liable to be compulsorily retired'while
still in his prime, for failing, to pass an
examination ; the Area Officer is practically
certain to be retired when the lads npw at
Duntroon are qualified to step into his -
shoes. And neither of them has aught to
look to thereafter but job-less poverty.. And
finally the Federal civil servant —-unlike the
State civilian, who has, at least; his State-
subsidised Superannuation Fund to fall
back on, when his years of productiveness
are ended —is as pensionless as the rest.
* * * *
It is seemingly impossible to convert a
hardshell Labor-Freetrader from the idiocy
of his ways, and the man who has the
Peace Society insect in his bonnet is quite
hopeless, and wholly immune to reason. But
the futility of fathering that other old
wraith of a dead-and-gone radicalism —viz.,
the anti-pension prejudice—should be pos-
sible of demonstration in the case of all but
the most irreconcilably Tory Democrats.
Putting aside the humanitarian aspect of
the question, and disregarding the equity
of the matter altogether, the system which
flourishes throughout the Commonwealth
services is rotten business. As regards the
Judges, it results in nationally valuable men
overworking themselves to the point of a
breakdown, or worse, because they cannot
afford to retire. It is unfair to them that
they should be impelled to this, and in the
end it is detrimental to the Commonwealth.
The business of the High Court is badly in
arrears, and litigants are suffering in con-
sequence, largely because of the ailing Judge
proposition. The country is bound ulti-
mately to lose, and lose heavily, by under-
paying its soldiers, and withholding nen-
sious from them. It is not in human
nature that many of the superior officers of
the unfortunates thus cast in a hard-up
state on the world, should be willing to
carry out the letter of the law in their re-
gard. Attempts will inevitably be made to
risrht a glaring legislative wrong by the
creation of all sorts of unnecessary billets
for eomnulsorilv-retired warriors. The
State will pay just the same, the only dif-
ference being that it will do if in the most
undesirable possible way. The solution is
for the Commonwealth to get into line with
the IMfed Kingdom, Germany, and the
other civilised nations in the matter of those
persons whose lives are devoted to the Ber-
vice of the State. They have as valid a
claim to spend their declining years in the
comfort they have always known as any
old age pensioner. It is questionable whether
they haven’t a stronger one. lhe scandal
of the under-pensioned Commonwealth
grows apace; in fact, it promises shortly to
be a more palpable scandal than that ot
over-pensioned Britain in the Waterloo yeai,
and thereabouts.
The Tale of the Woman.
The story of “Clarence O’Hagan”:—
I hate Cant. In the Sydney Industrial Court, the
other day, a Mr. Miller waxed beautifully -indignant
because it was proposed to fix the hours of shopgirls
at 46 per week. He rose up right there and said it
was wrong, and oppressive, and reprehensible, and
degrading, and generally undesirable. He went on to
say that H hours should be fixed as the limit, be-
cause to work them longer was most injurious to the
future wives and mothers of the workers, 7 andi then
I felt that Mr. Miller was not an apostle of Liberty,
but only a missionary of Humbug, and an advance
agent for his own brother Cant. There are 168
hours in a week, and the girl who has to hand out
gloves, ox tote coffee, or weigh-up chocolates, or sew,,
or clean, or measure-off, for 46 hours a week, has
122 hours left for sleeping, eating, gossip, _ surf-
bathing, dressing and philandering. Allow her a
solid and regular eight hours nightly sleep, and she
still has 66 hours for food, meditation, reading and
hair-curling—an average of eight hours daily with
10 left over for church-going, prayers and sundries. Not
too bad, is it ? But, when Mr. Miller’s dream for
her is achieved, and the girl becomes “a wife and
mother” in Israel (or Botany), what then? Here is
an average “wife and mother’s” daily programme:—
Rise 6 or 6.30 a.m. Light the fire. Breakfast
for the old man.
Lunch ditto.
Breakfast for kids (say three) and self.
Get kids off to school.
Wash up.
Do out house and make beds.
Wash (Mondays).
Iron (Tuesdays).
Lunch for three kids and self.
Wash up. Tidy kitchen.
Prepare kids’ tea ; ditto for self.
Prepare old man’s dinner.
Wash up.
Put kid's to bed.
Mending and sewing.
Retire to bed (if lucky) at 10 p.m.
In addition, there is the door to answer, hawkers to
deal with or chase away, the time-payment and rent-
fiends to meet, shopping to do, calls to receive and
make, priest or parson to placate; gas, water and
dust-inspectors to cope with ; wood to chop up, and
a dozen little odd jobs about the house which the old
man can’t or won’t do. If, on top of all this,
the “wife and mother” averages six solid hours
nightly sleep, she is exceptionally fortunate. Mr.
Miller and his sort are always academically solici-
tous for the Australian female, but as soon as she
becomes “a wife and mother” in Israel (or Colling-
wood) they cheerfully and uncomplainingly let her
work and slave for —not 1/6 —but about 126 hours a
week! Even the occasional “amusements” or “out-
ings” of poor Ma are one long wrestle with food,
parcels, trams and refractory kids! If Mr. Miller
had suggested that our girls should have to work only
70 hours per week after marriage he would have de-
served three cheers. As it is—he deserves about three
months, for canting.

“Mr. Ocky” : I have no desire to exhume a
dead argument, but I am somewhat concerned that
the windiest place in Australia (L have just escaped
from it) was not nominated in your recent competi-
tion. It is in the Western District of Victoria, be-
tween Birregurra and Dean’s Marsh, and it has no
name. The name has blown away, all except an
“e” and the fragment of a “z,” which still drift
hither and thither among the tangle of the gales.
Nobody lives there ;, the last inhabitant was a shining
light of the Methodist persuasion, and he was blown
out. There are no trees nor flowers nor grass nor
birds. Even the birds were blown away backwards,
clawing at the atmosphere with their feet as they
went. The old road has been blown into the next
county, and the railway deviates round this windy
region afar oil'. For 365 days in the year there is
nothing but wind between Birregurra and Dean’s
Marsh. I and 10 other men have slept, chained to
gether, at an angle of 45 degrees, leaning against it,
with our carpet bags for pillows, and it felt like
a restless feather bed. Once a big life assurance
concern lent money on real estate in this region, but
the wind blew the land from underneath the mort-
gage; and it blew the principal due north, and the
interest due south ; and then it blew the unearned
increment straight up; and nothing was ever col-
lected from that day to this.

PIKE BROTHERS LTD.,
BRISBANE.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, Octobee 5, 1912.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
In keeping with the wobbly traditions of
her sex, the Macgregor’s lady changed her
mind at the Ilfth hour, and, instead of
leaving for the Cold Country by the White
Star boat Medic, as first arranged, her pre-
sent intention is to sail by the Dutchman
Seharnhorst. En route to Melbourne, his
Bx. accompanied the missus as far as Wal-
langarra, where the parting words, etc.,
were spoken. Then the Cliiel handed his
lady over to the tender care of the 4ft. 84in.
gauge, and turned back for Toowoomba,
thence to visit the towns of the west.
He is being abetted by aide de Foxton, and
the Avorst is expected to be over by the 11th
inst., when the sporran will once more
resound in the glens o’ Brisbane.
The deadly orange blossom has been un-
duly prolific hereabouts lately. On Wednes-
day, Basil Bergin, of Tomoo Station, Mit-
chell, led to the altar Miss Madge Crowe, of
New Farm. The bride’s three sisters were
on hand to see fair play, and Mr. J. Walsh
and Mr. H. Bergin lent a little timely aid
to the ’groom. The wedding garment of
satin and lace was a thing of beauty and a
joy for the time being, and the presents
were almost sufficient excuse for the deed.
On Wednesday, one J. A. Cleeve, of Clay-
field, bound over Miss Constance Montifiore
to keep the peace of wedded life. The bride
m a very pretty girl, and the affair passed
off even more smoothly than does the usual
hitching. Another mating was that of one
Hayes-Good, of Victoria, to Miss Speedy, of
Ashgrove. Indeed, every day this week one
or more flustered ’grooms and complaisant
brides have been whirled down our well-
worn main street with a madly-leaping shoe
attached to the chariot, and, in one case at
least, a placard announcing to an applaud-
ing world: “Just Married.”
A very swagger affair was the marriage
of Miss Jessie Persse, a daughter of the
squatter monarch of that name, to Cecil Del-
pratt, whose paddocks rub boundaries with
the Persse lands. Limerick lace was largely
used in embellishing the bride, and the wed-
ding gifts included a bloated cheque from
pa Persse, who is noted for his generosity.
Mrs. Jack. Nixon Smith, who has just re-
turned from Fogland, was greeted by some
50 pals at an afternoon tea at the South
Brisbane croquet lawn on Thursday. The
usual infant butted in with the inevitable
bunch of vegetables, and Canon Hay added
clerical dignity to the ensuing food. Two
other trippers who have lately returned from
the land of insuffragettes are Dr. Lilian
Cooper and Miss Bedford.
SOMETHING WRONG.
THE POET : " Do you know that those last
verses of mine were inspired by your eyes?"
SHE: “Were they? Heavens! I'll see an
oculist at once."
Dr. Pulleine, of Adelaide, whose simple
taste runs to spiders, especially the species
that wears a trap-door on its mansion, is
here making further collections of shudder-
some specimens. A full-blown Swedish pro-
fessor, whose weakness is butterflies and
other tame creatures, has joined in the hunt.
The combined enthusiasts will brave the
pests of the Logan next week.
Mrs. Kingsbury has reason to pat herself
on the back since she and several other
toilers amassed £l2O at their recent f@te for
the Alexandra Home. The lady is now look-
ing round for any other cause that needs
a leg up. But the causes are requested not
to all speak at once, lest her energy that be-
getteth a move on for charity should be
overwhelmed in the rush.
The race meeting to-day was a very mild
affair. The atmosphere was filled with real
estate, gritted up fine, and those females
who wrestled with their garments and a
high wind on the, for once, dingy lawn,
were not wearing their finest feathers. One
of the smartest was Mrs. Bob McNab, whose
plain crepe frock and panama hat put many
a more pretentious garment in the place
where life appears to be a blank and a dead
end.
Yours remorselessly,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
“Kobbi”: George Jones, who passed out
at Stanwell, near Rockhampton (Q.), the
other day, at a great age, was a Blue
School (Herefordshire) boy. The Halls
(Wesley and Walter of that ilk) were
schoolmates of his, and he arrived in Aus-
tralia with them ’way back in ’59. But
Jones didn’t have the luck to strike Mount
Morgan, like the Halls, and so to the end
nothing of any importance Happened to
Jones at all.
Elections are but mild, anaemic things in
Bananaland these days by comparison with
the good old times. A mouldy issue of the
Courier tells how, when W. 11. Groom was
elected for Toowoomba in 1862, “as the
parties were retiring from the town the re-
spective processions commenced an attack on
each other, and a scene worthy of Donnybrook
occurred. Heads were cracked and distin-
guishing flags were taken and retaken, but
the principals quelled the disturbance.” So
it wasn’t complete harmony and love of law-
n’order before the advent of Labor, after
all.
A big rush of immigrants to Queensland
is just commencing. When the Denham
Government suspended the “Assisted” Regu-
lations, it was found that large numbers of
people were raising the whole of the passage
money themselves or getting it remitted to
Bntam by their relatives in Queensland.
Man,” said a Scottish new arrival to the
writer, “there’s 4000 empty houses in Glas-
sy and the folk are leavin’ in shoals.”
Bull’s country is about the finest land on
earth to get away from at present.
. to tbe s y dne y Evening News,
•>OOO Bulgarian boy scouts have offered
their services to do the work of reservists
who are ordered to the front, and, as the
News wisely observes, “Belgrade may now
see a strange sight.” If 3000 Bulgarian
boy scouts are so mad as to go to Belgrade,
there will be a strange sight—the spectacle of
all these maddened infants being arrested for
invading a foreign country. The Servian is
a short-tempered man, and he doesn’t like
0000 foreign boy scouts coming to his capi-
tal.
Quaint patch reprinted from an old
Coukier (1862) : “Our Port Denison
correspondent writes that McKinley the ex-,
plorer has just arrived from Port Denison.
Mr. McKinley is practically dark on the
subject of his expedition, positively refusing
to enlighten people.... He confesses to hav-
ing eaten seven horses and -me or more
camels. The whole party are in good
health, but considerably reduced in personal
bulk The men point to Mr. McKinley.
wh o> is geting quite jolly, and swear that
he is as hard as nails, and nothing can
aftect him.” Really a man who could look
quite jolly” after assisting to eat seven
horses or _ one or more camels must have
fairl y tough specimen. The camels
o 2 must have been of a very different
breed from those paraded nowadays by Ram
Bux in the Bakblox. Neither nigger, Chow
nor R. Bux himself will ever tackle them.
“Kohu” : Some highly-gifted person once
remarked that the calf is the father of the
cow, or words to that effect. Much-bor-
rowing Maoriland has long been, looking for
trouble, and, lately, has simply been run-
ning after it without hat, coat or um-
brella. Barring lucky accidents, there seems
pretty good reason to expect that it will
come up with the solid and unhappy thing
before the race has been continued much
longer. The calf, which in this case fore-
shadows or suggests or foretells the cow, is
an animal which haunts the neighborhood
of Whangarei, in the region north of Auck-
land. There the local county council wants
to borrow £1771, in excess of the overdraft
limit, from the Bank of Maoriland, and the
bank won’t touch the transaction unless the
coifncillorg sign an agreement to be jointly
and severally resoonsible. Up to the
present the councillors have remarked with
considerable unanimity that they’ll be
hanged if they’ll sign the thing, or words to
that effect.’ The' present position is that
the council ,ean’t pay to get its rate books
compiled,. and can’t get any cash until they
are compiled, and that, short of a miracle of
some sort, the works of the public machine
will come to a full stop, and refuse to
start again. Maoriland in the mass may
soon have the same cheery proposition to
face, with the bailiffs in, and the key of the
back door lost, and the water supply cut
off, while there is a fire raging in the best
bedroom, and not a drop of beer in the
water-bottle. Also, Cohen may not be
willing to lend enough to buy one more cray-
fish for supper on the several and joint

Back to the Middle Ages.
Every illustrated journal, every moving-
picture-show, is at present teeming with
representations of the funeral of “General”
Booth. When the cinematograph displays
the pictui-esque pageant, brilliant with ban-
ners, vivid with uniforms, and glittering with
the sheen of brass bands, the orchestra ac-
companies the procession with the pathetic
strains of “The h'lowers of the Forest” and
Chopin’s j “Marche Funfebre”; with the
triumphant harmonies of Beethoven’s
“Funeral March” and Handel’s “Dead
March” from “Saul.” No dead monarch,
at least in modern times, has received
grander or more impressive obsequies. No
hero of a thousand fights has been accom-
panied to his last resting-place with higher
honors. A king, princes, nobles sent con-
dolences to the_ dead “General’s” relatives,
and sympathetic commiserations to the
“Army,” bereft of its leader. Mercantile
firms and private individuals subscribed
large sums, in cases reaching four figures,
to a memorial, etc., etc. Now, what does
it all mean? The dead man has been lauded
by many, and decried by few. Journals

IMMIGRANT: " Why, ' there's not a
blade of grass nor a tree in sight."
FARMER : “ That's nothin’. Just

have given columns of valuable space to his
biography—mostly eulogistic. A few have
described him as a Moses of sand, a Ma-
homet of straw, a charlatan, a Cagliosteo.
All these epithets are probably undeserved.
One can understand the eulogies of the high-
placed and the wealthy. They naturally
countenanced one who diverted the “sub-
merged multitude” from the practical eco-
nomic problems of earthly existence by pic-
turing the problematical joys of a promised
Paradise. But the man himself is the
greatest problem of the movement he
created. He lived down opposition and tri-
umphed over ridicule. He outlived the ter-
rible criticism and scathing denunciation of
Professor Huxley. He coerced to his aid the
sanction of royalty and aristocracy, and the
monetary support of high-class philan-
thropy and trepidant commercialism. Not
a Moses or a Mahomet in any sense,
though, perhaps, a great deal of a Cagli-
osteo. His protoptype in history was, how-
ever, Petee the Hermit, and the movement
he headed was a recrudescence of the Middle
Ages. In a \ day of progressive democracy
he re-instituted the principle of mediaeval
autocracy. Emeeson says that if John
Smith were of the King breed, and wrote
over the door-beam of his house, “John
Smith, King,” folk would flock from all
quarters of the earth, and come to him to
be ruled. Among his submerged millions
William Booth found an empire awaiting
autocratic rule, and he ruled with a rod of
iron. But his empire has ended. The move-
ment was sporadic, and it has outlasted its
early enthusiasm. It has become formal
and creedal, and all creeds are the shrouds
of dead faiths. Moreover, it has not even
a self-believing Cagliosteo to inspire it.
But all this is far from the point. What
does it mean, this curious phenomenon of
successful autocracy, of unyielding surren-
der to the leadership of a single unit, in this
age of democracy, of science, or socialism,
of unionism, of communism? It means
that in every so-called great civilisation
the vast “under-dog” section of the com-
munity, to use Blatciifobd’s phrase, has
not yet emerged from a condition of culture
which was characteristic of the entire people
in the days, say, of Henby 11. or Richaed
I. of England. Booth’s influence over the
untutored and underfed and under-sanitated
was the influence of a Petee the Hermit, in
the epoch of the Crusades. His influence
has been altogether evil, inasmuch as it re-
riveted the clamps of authority on unde-
veloped minds. Cablyle considers that re-
sults only count, the methods that attain
results not at all. Extend the dictum—in-
fluences count, the motives that bring about
influences not at all. Booth’s influence
bad, and to be deprecated. Good in-
tentions are paving-stones for other places
than the infernal regions. 1
—T- ♦
“Hamer”: The clerk is no longer the hope-
less and helpless sort of person industrially
that he once was. In the Cold Country all
the people who lick stamps for a living have
been almost forced into the National Union
of Clerks by the National Insurance scheme
and the organisation has now hitched its
waggon to the star of 355. a week minimum
salary. This demand has roused the em-
ployers to make remarks about the ruin of
the country and the destruction of property
and other wild things which are already
being far more effectively done by Freetrade
In the Australian States unions are every-
where trying to stir things Up. Westralian
clerks have an opportunity of going before
the Arbitration Court, and are using their
advantage to hurl claims at the employers
which may cause them to lose sleep and'use
up much valuable time in profanity. In
Victoria the pen-pushers have nominally se-
cured a Wages Board; but as the thing is
mostly composed of employers and the
clerks have only a minute representation on
it, it doesn’t amount to much. Such a
Board, in true accord with Victorian senti-
ment and feeling, holds as feVv meetings as
possible, and looks upon work as the special
business it is not there to do. Still, the
moribund affair has accomplished one revo-
lutionary change in laying it down that
women clerks shall have the same rank and
cash reward as the men who fill similar bil-
lets. Even in Tassv the clerks are after a
Wages Board, but in N.S.W. the clerks have
still no sort of tribunal before which their
claims can be laid. The N.S.W. Union is
now so strong in numbers that it is saying
things threateningly to employers, and* in-
tends to secure improved conditions, with or
without a Board.
Malayan Bride-Song.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I’ll twine the gold of cassia buds
About your dusky hair,
And set red jasmine sprays to bloom
Upon your bosom fair.
Rose leaves I’ll strew beneath your feet,
And for our bridal bed
111 gather spicy mountain thyme
And lotus lilies spread.
A palace in the blue, far hills, t
Walled round with palm and vine, j
And old, rare jewels magic wrought
Shall soon, Yesese, be thine;
And I shall call you Forest Queen.
Ihe name I love the best,
When I have led my dream-girl home
lo our green woodland nest. f ;
No gem can match the velvet fires
That from your'dark eyes float.
Ihe lustre of the 1 pearl is dim V.
That lies against your throat, u
And when I hear your voice, Vesese.
-Lis a_s some happy dove
That mingles with the lark’s glad- song
A throbbing note of love.
Beside a silvered sea I wait;
A tender crescent moon
Has paved with light a gleaming track
I hat I shall follow soon ;
The little waves . race up the beach. I ;
Their voices faintly blown—
“ Come south-west wind! Come, fill the sail!
A lover waits alone !”

554 GEORGE STREET,
SYDNEY, N.S.W.
Slab of philosophy from Mrs. Bogue Ltjef-
mann’s Pali. Mall Magazine article, “A
Week on a N.S.W. Dairy Farm” :
The roving spirit which has become the second
nature of the Australian had not laid hold of this
quiet valley. Each inhabitant possessed “a stake in
the country” in the shape of a few acres of soil.
The pastoral life, with its monotonous, strenuous
duties, is the antidote to unrest. Nature, by exact-
ing that cows should be milked twice a day, has
done more to strengthen human character than all
the teaching of the moralists.
The cocky farmer, in fact, may be said to
be tethered to a beef-stake in the country!
But there is precious little rest for the kids
who —as the writer chronicles —walk to
school and back, three miles each way, and
milk “about 10” each, in what should be
their spare time. A “brave record,” she
calls it, and apparently does not mean to
be sarcastic. In fact, she chronicles with
approval the remark of a sweating employer
—“a sturdy countryman,” she calls him:
“I’ve got 11 children, and I’m praying for
a twelfth.”
♦
“The Bos’un’s” tarry remarks: —
The more I see of these so-called Labor members,
the more I deplore the inadequacy of the Dictionary
of Daily Curses. I had just used up all the available
Language upon that furious tortoise, Premier
McGowen (N.S.W.), when the report on the Navi-
gation Bill in committee at the Australian House of
Reps, blew aboard. As the Bill was originally
drafted, provision was made for a winter load line in
Australian water; but who do you think fought it
tooth, and claw ? No less than the two representatives
of Newcastle (N.S.W.). They urged—and both of
them Labor men, mind you—that, “in the interests
of the trade of Newcastle,” an exception should be
made in favor of coal cargoes , the worst of all
cargoes when D. Jones is ravening for a ship’s crew.
As a matter of fact, in the case of coals, the Plim-
soll mark should be lowered rather than raised—a
statement not based on scientific argument, but upon
the long list of ships which have gone to the bottom
with all hands, while carting fuel from Newcastle
across the afore-mentioned Jones’s sodden paddock.
Most of those vessels were marked in the highest
class at Lloyd’s, but I’m going into no long argu-
ment as to whether their loading at Newcastle was
the cause of their loss. I’m satisfied, let who else
be not. But what I do sav. and even bellow, is that
the _ loss-of-ships-to-say-nothing-of-lives rate will not
be improved if the winter load line is not in-
sisted upon. The trouble is that so many sailors
trading out of Newcastle, particularly those who
never return, have no votes. And who has the ad-
dress of the politician that wastes time on the dis-
franchised ?
Communication from “F.S.” :—
This is the glad time of the year when cows calve
and milk cheques are bloated enormously. For the
good of the milk cheque, the dairyman murders a
good 80 per cent, of the calves practically as soon as
they arrive. In the bad old days he used to skin
them, the hides (worth 2s. 6d. each) being the per-
quisite of his j>oorlv-paid employee. In these far
worse days the corpses are sent to the metropolis to
be converted into the succulent sausage—both Ger-
man and plain. The trade in these toothsome deli-
cacies has reached its height in the Victorian
AVestern District, where truck loads of dead calves,
from 24 hours to a fortnight old, and of all stages of
health and ill-health, are sent to Melbourne every
week. All along the line from Geelong to Port Fairy, at
practicaly every station, there are consignments of
the deceased and diseased waiting for the weekly
train. This year, owing to the high price of meat,
dead calves are bringing extra rates, and 12s. is a
common return. The dairymen are, therefore, hur-
rying the remains forward, and the Melbourne agents
are receiving them joyfully. There is a Board of
Health regulation that these calves must be at least
a month old before being killed, and must weigh
401 b. Not one in a hundred fulfils these conditions.
A few are a fortnight old when killed, but most of
them are slaughtered within a few days of birth.
Many, in fact, are killed within 48 hours of birth.
Any calf killed under a month old is practically “a
slink that is, its flesh is unset and unhealthy.
But the dairyman doesn’t care; he doesn’t eat it.
Instances of calves born dead being sent to market
are not altogether unknown. As for the weight test,
there are scores of calves in the Western District that
weigh 401 b. at birth. The flesh of these abomina-
tions is, of course, disguised with seasoning and an
admixture of other flesh when it is made into
sausages, so that the unfortunate consumer cannot
detect it. The trade has grown so important now
that if the city did not receive its big weekly con-
signment of slinks there would be a serious falling off
in the “meat” supply. At the same time, the trade
requires urgent attention—the sort of attention that
the John Hop gives.
*
“K.” writes:—
Apparently there is something very rotten in the
Victorian system of making-up the electoral rolls.
Old residents of East Melbourne complained last
week that they had been unaccountably disfranchised
as electors for the State, whilst Senator Millen de-
clared that the Commonwealth rolls contain about
100,000 names in excess of the total number of
Victorian adults recorded by the State and Common-
wealth statists. The deficiency may be due to the
carelessness of the disfranchised citizens, but the ex-
cess—if it is not Millen's mare’s nest—argues an
extraordinary combination of statistical inaccuracy on
the one hand or an amazing feat of roll-collecting
or “stuffing” on the other.
The other day a wife-deserter was
grabbed by the minions of O’Callaghan and
lodged in the Prahran (Vic.) watch-house.
One Curwen-Walker, J.P., thereupon broke
loose in this way :
It was a scandalous shame that accused, who was
a very respectable man, should have been placed in
the local watchhouse cells, which were a disgrace to
the Government. They might be suitable for de-
taining drunken men, but were unsuitable for detain-
ing respectable men. The badlv-lighted and -venti-
lated cells were nothing else than “holes,” and were
enough to make anyone who was detained there, for
even a brief period, ill.
It raises some interesting questions, such
as:—-
(1) Loeg; ’ this unusual J.P. consider that it is
a fair- thffig to put anyone, respectable or otherwise,
m reel Is which are a disgrace to the Government?
(2) Does he consider drunks less respectable than
wife-deserters ?
(3) Are drunks so lacking in respectability, any-
how, that it is a fair thing to immure them in iil-
ventilated cells, of so dreadful a character that any-
one who is detained there, even for a brief period
gets ill? ’
(4) Does he consider that these are proper refuges
even for forgers, burglars, and so-forth, taking into
consideration that imprisonment in insanitary holes
is no part of the-punishment which the law 'imposes
for such crimes? 1
(5) What is a respectable wife-deserter, and how
pocket? COmpare moral, V with a respectable pick-
W Does Curwen-Walker believe that the Prahran
watchhouse cells should not be altered into civilised
places so Jong as respectable people manage to keen
out of them, and, if so, why? *
An elucidation of such mysteries as the
above would go far to solve the ancient pro-
bieES},: J” llat is the mental fount and origin
of J’s.P. justice?
“Adelaide”: South Aus. is a pleasant
place for pick-and-shovel men just now.
The terms offered on the East-West railway
from Port Augusta attract everybody, and
private contractors for other railways—
which are rather frequent in the Central
State at present—find that men would
rather work on the big line, for the Federal
Government, at the same pay, than for them.
It is a steady sort of job, for one thing.
And there is the influence of the local mem-
ber to fall back upon if concessions are
wanted. The navvies’ camps may make or
break the local member for many a long day.
“Karee”: Brennan’s mono-rail, the con-
trartion which has shown its ability to do
120 miles an hour on its single rail, is com-
ing all right. It has now invaded Germany,
and a railw r ay is being built on Brennan’s
principle. And in Australia, where the
world’s biggest railway jobs are on hand,
the great inventor, who might possibly have
saved half the cost of our transcontinentals
and half the time required for the journey
across the continent, can’t even get a hear-
ing from the hidebound Governments.
The Chinaman is a dull and pigtailed
fraud at his best. Ilis lies may pass in his
own country, but they are not up to Euro-
pean standard. Thus 28 allegedly natural-
ised Chinamen have appeared at Melbourne,
within the last three months, demanding
admission, and showing papers which ex-
plained that they were old residents return-
ing from a brief holiday in Chowland. And
24 of them were sent back with shrieks of
mirth on the first moment of inspection.
The papers referred to old grandad Chow
aged about 70 or so, and each impersonator
was a gushing Chinese youth of anything
from 10 to 30. Even a Bulgarian would
know enough to be more plausible than that.
A lack of that minute attention to detail
that is supposed to constitute genius has
resulted in the bowling out of Stanley
James, of St. Kilda (Vic.), and in making
his name a by-word and a thing of naught
among men. Stanley, it seems, had a mind
to give the public a burglar scare—as
though the . force’s incompetence hadn’t
given it enough already—so he constructed
a fearsome narrative of a ferocious marau-
der whom he observed leaving his rooms
one midnight. He grabbed him by the heel,
but the burglar discourteously kicked him,
so he let go and threw a bath at his re-
treating countenance. This so annoyed the
marauder that he returned and chastised
Stanley, who retaliated. Then ensued a
tremendous struggle, in the course of which
the defender of the home —he was only a
boarder in a hash-foundry, but that doesn’t
matter —sustained many severe slashes across
the face, from a razor apparently. After the
riot had continued a space Stan retired in
disorder and got his revolver, which he
pointed out of the window and fired at the
vanished burglar. The Law didn’t seem to
find the tale too convincing, but the dis-
figuration of Stan’s countenance and the
reckless manner in which his gore had been
spilt were more than convincing, so the
Law put on _ a mysterious aspect and got
busy. It noticed that, though Stan’s room
was upside down, the ground outside the
window was tidy and nicely-raked; that a
filter just inside the aperture had somehow
remained undisturbed; and that the cuts
on the plaintiff’s chest and arms in no way
corresponded with those in his pvjamas.
So the youth was urged to tell all about it,
lest he be run in for wasting the Law’s
valuable time or something. After he had
published the true version of the matter, he
was “despatched to the hospital for medical
attention.”

On Face, Hands and Body. Spent
Night after Night Without Sleep.
Felt Like Scratching Herseif to
Pieces. Tried Cuticura Oint-
ment. Freefrom All Itching.
“For several years I have suffered with
eczema on the face, hands and body, and
when it - got very bad I would spend night
after night without any sleep, and at times
I would feel like scratching myself to pieces.
I tried several so-called remedies without
getting the slightest relief. One day I was
telling a friend of mine the pain I was suffer-
ing and she told me to try the marvelous
Cuticura Ointment. I did this and I am
very pleased to state that to-day I am quite
free from all such itching that is brought
about by that dreaded eczema.
“I will never be without a pot of Cuticura
Ointment in the house. Any one suffering
from eczema, burns, boils or any other
abrasions of the body could not possibly do
better than keep a pot of Cuticura Ointment
in the house.” (Signed) Mrs. T. J. Hazel-
wood, Islington, So. Australia, Dec. 9, 1910.
Baby's Face Like Raw Beef
‘‘My baby boy had a large pjmple come
on his forehead. It burst and spread all
over his face which soon looked like a piece
of raw beef, all smothered with bad pimples.
It was awful to look at. The poor little
thing used to scratch it and cry terribly.
I took him to a doctor but he only got
worse until I was quite frightened that he
would always be disfigured. Then I got two
tins of Cuticura Ointment, together with
Cuticura Soap, and in two months had quite
cured him. Now of course I use Cuticura
Soap for all my children. (Signed) Mrs.

10,000 FREE TRIAL BOXES.
Those who are troubled with falling hair, dandruff,
baldness, itching scalp, etc., know full well the
humiliation that they cause. There is no need, how-
ever, of such conditions. These troubles can be
quickly overcome by ray True Hair Grower.
I am not an advertising quack, but am a business
man. My hair began to grow thin about the time
I reached the age of thirty. When I had reached the
age of thirty-five the top of my head was quite bald.
1 had considerable pride, and sought for something
to cause renewed growth. I invested in every pre-
paration that I could see or hear of, and here let me
say that not only did I try all the English so-called
restorers, but those of Continental Europe. I also
visited specialists. My experimenting cost me many
sovereigns and considerable time—yet the hairs came
not. 1 had given up the idea of ever growing hair
again. One afternoon, while enjoying a brief busi-
ness respite by an Alpine trip, I fell in with an old
collegiate chemist, whose hair was particularly plen-
tiful. I jokingly remarked that I wished he could
spare some of his hair for my benefit. This lead him
to tell me that he understood the human hair as well
as a good dentist understands teeth. He wrote out a
formula, and suggested that I have a quantity of the
compound prepared. I did this a few days later. I
was astonished to see the hair coming forth after
several applications, and within six weeks my head
was covered by a firm, yet soft, black growth of hair.
Since then the hair on my head has been as luxuriant
as when in my school days. Having arranged for
the legal right to do so, I have for some time been
privately selling this marvellous hair-growing com-
pound. I hold over one thousand letters from people
who have actually grown new hair through the
medium of my true hair grower. I do not pretend
to say it is the only hair grower in the world —I am
not interested in decrying others —but I do assert
that it is the most reliable, and in the end by far the
cheapest.

“Pat O’Maori”: Maoriland is admittedly a country
of dreadful thirst. But the steps taken to mitigate
the baneful tendency can be overdone. It has latterly
become a custom of the furniture trade to mix pyri-
dine with furniture polish to prevent workers in the
household sticks trade drinking- the liquid for the
sake of the spirit it contains. Now, pyridine is a
drug which hits at long range, and without being
quaffed as a beverage. W. Manson, secretary of the
Auckland Furniture Trades’ Union, has in his books
the names of 27 persons who have suffered from it,
in greater or less degree, for periods ranging from 12
hours to three weeks. Further, the men so suffering
had to lose their pay, and received no sort of com-
pensation for the pain they were forced to endure.
Surely something simpler and less dangerous could
be mixed with the methylated spirits which would be
sufficient to make even a thirsty person in the saltest
and most arid region of Hades avoid the blandish-
ments of the bottle. When Younghusband took his
expedition to the high tablelands of Thibet, the cold
was so great that the water in the water-jackets of
the machine-guns became a mass of solid ice. In
order to keep the weapons fit for the slaughter of
any objectionable Asiatic thing which might come in
the road, the water-jackets were filled with rum, and
kerosene was mixed with the rum to tone down its
delight. Judging by the sort of compounds the
average chemist can put up to heal the sick, there
ought to be no great difficulty about finding a ter-
rific, but perfectly harmless, substitute for pyridine,
which would make it as unpalatable as liquid brimstone
or a glass of dry sawdust, or a flagon of assafoetida.

“D.M.W.”: Cash earned by the sweat of the brow
is likely to go further than that obtained from the
pawnshop. Where Cohen’s millions are being im-
ported those in charge of the coffers are inclined to
tr.eat them as they would free beer, and allow a good
deal to splash over on the floor. A few years ago,
when Maoriland Parliament House escaped from de-
struction by earthquake through being consumed by
fire, there was a considerable outcry against a pro-
posed expenditure of £lOO,OOO on a new building.
Since then Government House has been taken over
as a temporary resting-place for political fatigue,
and a new Government House has been erected in the
old asylum grounds. In one way and another,
£99,526 has already been spent without there being
any Parliament House to show for it, except, of
course, the patched ruins of the old building. An-
other £63,000 is to be spent in some more patching,
and then probably an earthquake, or fire, or revolu-
tion will come along, and there will be another call
for the expenditure of £lOO,OOO. After that, it is
reasonable to suppose, there will be further pre-
liminary expenses equal to about twice the alleged
cost of the whole, and a new crop of delays, hopes,
fears, explanations, complaints, questions and other
absurdities, before there is any sort of building to
show for all the expenditure and talk. And yet, on
a fair estimate, £30,000, well spent in the first in-
stance could easily have provided all that will be
needed in the way of Parliamentary accommodation
for the next century or so.

Some interesting items, from the report of a select
committee of the House of Commons, appointed to
inquire into the British Government’s Stationery
Department. Total annual bill for the supply of
paper, £337,000; printers’ bill, £350,000, divided
among some 200 private printing offices. John Bull
has no Government printing office, although he would
save a good deal of money by starting and running
one. Some of the best printing firms will -not tender
for Government work on account of “very bad hand-
writing” or “appalling copy,” as one of the wit-
nesses put it; months of waiting for the return of
proofs, and extravagant corrections. The committee
recommend type-written copy for the future. Note-
paper for M’s.P. costs £9OOO a year, plus £2OOO
per annum for the supply of a superior sort of paper
to M’s.P. with luxurious tastes. The committee
thinks this extra-expensive paper should no longer
be supplied. So does the poor taxpayer.

Dealing in rotten and partially rotten merchandise
is at best a sad, musty way of snatching a living
from the back lanes of Commerce ; but when a med-
dling Board of Health starts interfering on behalf of
the public stomach, it becomes absolutely precarious.
A day or so ago, a poor Sydney bankrupt told the
Registrar how he had been financially wounded by
the act of the Board of Health officials in wresting
from him 170 cases of currants, and hurrying them
away to the tip. They were alive with weevils and
jumpers, but were otherwise quite all right, and, after
stirring them up with a stick, he had hoped to get
51 docile casefuls out of the leaping confusion. How-
ever, a high-stomached Board had condemned the
whole football match or riot, and sent it off the com-
mercial field for life. He was sued for the price of
the jumping competition, contested the case, but lost
both it and the subsequent appeal. By that time his
affairs were suffering from blue ruin, and the out-
look was dark brown. The only thing that was
feeling better than it might have been was that
villainously illtreated receptacle, the public vest. No
sepulchre seems to hold so many awful secrets as the
public vest.
* * * *
“Vulcan”: Re the impending Transcontinentals, an
English paper tells of one George Gates, a Californian
inventor, who, in an effort to displace the extremely
temporary wooden railway sleeper, has evolved a
composite substitute, quasi-concrete, of “extraordin-
ary resiliency and durability.” In 1911 he sold the
patent rights to a syndicate of 11 Yankee railway
cos. for £3,500,000, and machines are said now to
be at work, each turning out 3500 of these composite
sleepers daily, with the prospect of completely scrap-
heaping the wooden sleeper within a few years. The
man who could drag money of that magnitude out of
a Yankee shindykit must have done it with something
extraordinarily permanent, cheap or revolutionary,
or the lot combined, and the matter might be worth
looking into.
“Ruru”: A Wellington (Maoriland) tram conductor
of fertile mind has invented a ticket-holding device
which is expected to make the lot of the fare-gatherer
a great deal easier than it is at present. The arrange-
ment enables the tickets to group themselves grace-
fully on the point of the little finger, so that the con-
ductor, while holding on down the corkscrew track
from Karori uy his front teeth, can pass out change
with a bent right hand and convey stoush to those
who insist on crowding the footboards with a
straight left. Short of holding the tickets with his
eyebrow, and administering change with his ear —an
arrangement which would leave part of his mouth
free to explain things to sight-seeing tourists —the
device seems to be as good as anything yet thought
of.
“Sir Octopus”: How frantic and unreasoning is
the eagerness of man to get into the new house which
Jerry, the builder, is perpetrating for him. I have
often noticed him sweeping the ground, or upending
superfluous stumps, while the foundation is being
laid. At night he makes it a practice to trip over
the building paraphernalia and bark his shins. On
the' first Saturday afternoon he brings his family and
friends to inspect the edifice. They improve upon
the builder’s work, and test it thoroughly with their
feet. The following half-holiday he devotes to muck-
ing about in his good clothes, and on the Sabbath
subsequent the family has a picnic in the ruins,
making various experiments to ascertain the effici-
ency of Jerry’s labor and material. Saturday after
half-holiday, and Sabbath after Sunday, for the super-
vening three or four weeks, he “does a bit towards
it.” Theh, one Lord’s Day, he camps there, arid
Bill presently brings the floorcloth in his cart. At
night they stand their pieces of candle on the mantel
shelves, and put in* nails where they may be wanted
on the walls. In the morning he goes to town with
hand-painted clothes, and (the farnilv having ar-
rived furnitureless in the meantime) he returns to
sit down on the floor to an evening meal of some
kind at about 10 p.m. Then, so to speak, he sleeps
on the dinner table, and, having washed at the tap
and towelled himself in a hurry with newspaper, he
once more (breakfastless) makes for the city. At
night, however, the new house is not like everything
in the garden, and but for the shrieks of children
whose toes have found loose tacks, and the odor of
the menu, you might think the establishment had
been erected 42 b.c. Thereafter he is “in.” and
the first keen rapture being over, the possessor of a
new-laid house gradually becomes like any other
human,

ARE YOU
DEAF?
If you are deaf, or going deaf, you will be glad to
hear of a simple and scientific device which restores
hearing, no matter how old you are. No mystery or
secrecy about it; we describe it fully, and explain
just how it acts. You use spectacles as sight magni-
fiers, and in the same way you use this sound magni-
fier to hear better. Unlike spectacles, the Wilson
Common-sense Ear-Drums are invisible and comfort-
able. No one can tell you are wearing them. They
rest the ear nerves by taking the strain off them —the
strain of trying to hear indistinct sounds. What a
relief to have done with that tiring strain. Being
made of the softest Para rubber they cannot be felt,
even when the head rests on a pillow. For the same
reason, a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
the ear. They protect the tender inner parts of the
ear, that are so sensitive, from cold winds, dust, sud-
den and piercing sounds.
So that you may clearly understand how the Sound
Magnifiers restore hearing, we give an illustration of
one as it lies in the ear. You will notice that the
Sound Magnifier is shaped like a trumpet, arid so con-
veys even the faintest sounds right to the natural drum.
Being of the softest rubber, it cannot hurt , the ear.
It fits the orifice of the ear
with precision and comfort.
The division that runs
across the mouth is to al-
low the removal and inser-
tion of the Ear-Drum, and
to brace it.
The shape of the Wilson
Ear-Drum has been chosen
after years of experience as
the best adapt-
ed to carry the
faintest sound.
Of course, if
you have lost
the h e a r i ng-
nerve co m-
pletely, or were
born deaf, we
cannot pretend
to cure you. Only a miracle could
do that, in spite of some of the
absurd claims made to-day. But
of you can hear the faintest sound,
do not despair. You will never
regret trving the Wilson Ear-
Drums. We have letters to show
you from deaf people in Australia
and New Zealand, who have been
cured, and you can be cured, too. You may wear
the Ear-Drums day and night, and take them out
whenever you wish. Children can wear them (we
have special sizes for children from six to twelve).
Even a child can insert and remove them without the
least danger.
The price is £1 (the fee for a doctor’s single
visit). This includes a pair of drums (they are only
sold in pairs), a fine nickel remover, and also an
inserter. After the first pair is bought you may pur-
chase a single drum at any time for Bs., but the
pair you get at first will last quite two years. Do
not ask for a trial pair. We do not send them out
on trial, and so they are never secondhand. Use the
Order form below, and the Outfit will be sent you
at once, with the fullest instructions. Don’t delay,
but have the comfort of good hearing as soon as you
can.

Do you know that you can cure
a Boil by simply rubbing it with
Dr. Sheldon’s Magnetic Liniment?
IF you have a Boil coming, you would do well to try Dr.
SHELDON’S MAGNETIC LINIMENT at once and note the
result. Rub the Liniment in well night and morning, and
you will soon notice the Boil will begin to
recede and disappear, and the skin will be
strengthened and purified so that no further
Boils will appear, as is often the case when
the skin is weakened by Boils in the first
instance.
If a Boil has developed, blood and matter must be
squeezed out, and the wound dressed with Dr.
Sheldon’s Magnetic Liniment. Persons suffering
from Boils should rub the parts affected thoroughl; j
twice a day with Dr. Sheldon’s Magnetic Liniment 1
This will prevent the growth of a whole crop of
Boils.
Banishes All Pain.

DR. SHELDON’S MAGNETIC LINIMENT will penetrate to your very
bones, soothe and subdue all pain, allay inflammation, and will purify and
tone up the skin, thus making, it less liable to affection from any skin!

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
-Vt"bw, A visitof from somewhere right
outside this Mundane Ball —
Do hot ask me where he came from,
tor that point’s not clear at all ;
For he might have been an angel, or he
might have come from Mars,
Or from any of the other of the fixed or un-
fixed stars.
As regards his mental make-up he was much
like you or me;
And he toured about the chantry* just to
sefe what he could see;
Well; this superhuman pefson was of most
inquiring mind*
And ’twaS noted, from his questions, he was
very far from blind,
And the striking thing about him was his
stern* compelling eye,
That demanded Truth ungarbled when he
paused for a reply.
And, despite the mental wriggles ,of the folk
he interviewed*
When they placed the Truth before bim she
was ab-so-lutely nude;
At bur Civilised Society he stored in some
amaze,
As he muttered his equivalent fob “Gosh !”
or “Spare me days!”
For our cherished modes and customs
knocked him sideways, so to speak.
‘•To solve,” said he, “this mystery, now
whither shall I seek?
For a sane and sound solution I must ques-
tion those on high*”
Said this extra-mundane being with the
stern, compelling eye.
Now, his methods were intelligent—quite
human, I confess,
For he started with our Politics, Religioh
and the Press.
Thus, he read a morning paper through, in-
tently, ev’ry leaf,
Then hied him out to interview the editor-
in-chief ;
“They say that Truth lives in a well,” he
muttered as he went;
“But her well is not an inkwell, T will lay
my last lone cent.”
It chanced he found the editor unguarded _
and alone
At the office of the paper—’twas the Morn-
ing Megaphone.
“Now, I take it,” said the visitor, “you re-
present the Press,
That great Public Educator?” And the
pressman murmured, “Yes.”
“Yet in yesterday’s edition I perceived a glar-
ing lie !
How’s this?” He fixed the pressman with
his stern, compelling eye.
Then the editor he stammered, and the editor
he “hemmed”
And muttered things like “Gracious me 1”
and likewise*\V T ell, I’m demned !”
But the lady Truth came tripping, all un-
dressed and unashamed:
“Oh, I own it!” cried the editor. “But how
can I be blamed?
There's our blighted advertisers and our
readers —Spare my grief !
But we’ve got to please the public!” moaned
the editor-in-chief.
“Now to interview a statesman and consider
his reply,”
Said this strange Select Committee with the
stern, compelling eye.
And the Honorable Member for Mud Flat
he chanced to find
In a. noble Spring-street building of a most
palatial kind.
And the Honorable Member viewed his visi-
tor with awe,
For he surely had the most compelling eye
you ever saw.
“Now, then, tell me,” said the visitor; “you
are a man of State,
And you blither on the platform of this
Nation grand and great;
Of this noble Land’s great, destiny I’ve heard
you talking hard,
But, whene’er it comes to voting, it s the
‘claims’ of your back yard.
Do you represent the Nation, as you often
say you do,
Or a hen-roost or a cow-yard, or a parish-
pump or two ?”
Then the politician stuttered, and the poli-
tician stared*
But to voice his patriotic platitudes he felt
too scared;
For the lady Truth insisted, and he blurted,
“It’s the Votes!
You must blame the dashed electors when
you see us turn our coats!
Our ' constituents control us. You must
please remember that.
And we’ve got to please the public!” whined
the Member for Mud Flat.
“Now to look into religion,” said the visitor.
“I’m told
I may get much information from a Wowser-
of-the-Fold.”
And he sought him out a Wowser of the
very sternest breed:
,f Sweet Charity, they tell me, is the key-
note of your creed.
And of mercy for the sinner* and of succor
for the weak
From the pulpit, on a Sunday, I have often
heard you speak;
Yet Charity is turned to Spite, and Scorn
becomes your creed
When they speak of giving bounty to weak
Magdalene in need.”
Then the Wowser hesitated, and the Wowser
rolled his eyes,
And sought in vain to call to mind some
Wowserish replies.
But the lady Truth came peeping, and the
Wowser cried, “O Lor!”
And hastily he drew the blind and, softly
closed the door.
“She is naked!” gasped the Wowser. Oh,
where are the hussy’s clothes?
If my dear brethren saw me now! Oh, what
do you suppose J”
“The Truth!” exclaimed the querist with the
stern, compelling eye.
“ ’Tis my flock !” exclaimed the Wowser. Oh,
I cannot tell a lie!
My flock of virgins sour and chaste and
matrons undeceived,
They would hound me from the pulpit if I
said what I believed!
I dote oil notoriety! The Truth, it must be
Oh Pve got to please my public!" moaned
the Wowser-of-the-Fold.
“Now, this Public; I must nail it,” said the
queer inquisitor. , ~ T ~
“ ’Tis the favor of this mighty god they all
seem eager for; ; ,
And tuey always strive to please him, and
his sentiments express .
In their Parliaments and l ulpits and their
organs of the Press. . i ,
And I’ll get a sure solution! if I have the iuck
to meet — , ,
What is this he’s called l—the Man, or
Bloque, or FelloW-in-the-Street.
A Fellow-in-the-Street was found, and typi-
cal was he, , . „
An eager hunter of the thing that men call
f. s. d. -
He wore a strained expression on his feat-
ures, dull and fiat, *
Also bifurcated coat-tails, and a little hard
found hat. . .
His talk was mainly platitudes, when it
wasn’t shop or horse,
And he had some fixed opinions and a bank
account, of course.
“Now then, tell me,” said the visitant,
“What are your private views
On your Politics, Religion and the Sheet
that gives Voti hews?
I have heard a lot abont yon, and a deal I d
like to knovt
Of why you work, and what you think, and
where you hope to go.
I feel assured that I shall find the Truth in
your reply.” . . .
And he fixed the fooolish Fellow with his
stern, compelling eye.
The Fellow hemmed and hawed a bit, the
Fellow looked about.
And the lady Truth smiled sweetly while
he murmured, as in doubt.
“Well, re-al-ly, my views upon these things
I can’t express-
You must ask our Politicians and the Par-
sons and the Press.
But as for me—well, candidly, you’ve got me
off my beat:
For 1 don’t know, much about it!” said the
Fellow-in-the-Street.
“ 'Tis the Circle!” cried the visitor. “ ’Tis
the same old crazy game
Right through the trackless Milky Way to
there from whence I came.
The Earth is round, the Moon is round, and
.Tupiter and Mars.
Their orbits all, and Saturn’s rings, and
countless million stars.
All throughout the constellations I have
journeyed, to and fro.
But; ev’rything goes round and round no
matter where I go.
All the Universe is circles ! All one tanta-
lising twirl !
Oh, is there nothing straight or square in all
this cosmic whirl?
And with these strange and cryptic words
the Being fled afar.
Back to his native hiding-place—his fixed
or unfixed star.
Some say his name was “Reason,” others
hold ’twas “Intellect” ; _
But, as for me, I have no views to voice in
that respect.
His motives seemed mysterious; I know not
how nor why;
I only know he had a stern and most com-
pelling eye.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BILLY GO WING and I were standing
on the steps of the South Australian
Hotel on North Terrace, looking to-
wards the old Adelaide railway station of
1895, and a man came up the ramp and
made a movement as of kicking a mangy
yellow cur, who had as many fleas as there
are in Constantinople in a good season. The
dog never got delivery of the kick, but the
mere anticipation was enough to make him
howl. He abandoned mustering his fleas
and ran westerly, looking around often as if
to say: “One of these days you’ll be hunting
your fleas, and then”
Billy Gowing regarded the kicker with
dislike and the cur with a sympathy not
easily to be suspected in a man made hard
by knocking against the sharp corners of
the world as he had been. He watched the
man disappear into King William-street, and
then he said :
“A canna bear to see cruelty to yin, o’
Gode’s dumb beasties ! I canna bear it!”
“Didn’t expect to find you so soft-hearted,
Billy. Weren’t you with a circus once?”
“i wis in charge o’ the wee elephants,
laddie! A groomed their injer-rubber bodies
an’ A manicured them, an’ pit on their
howdies for the r-ring, an A was valet to a
hip-po-tamus. But it didna make ma hearrt
harrd to Gode’s dumb creatures.”
“And weren’t you once breaking-in camels
at Port Augusta?"
“Aye—but that didna harrden my hert.”
“Did you break-in camels with prayer?”,
“No; wi’ nose-pegs, laddie; nose-pegs an’
chastisements —but not wi’ cruelty.”
“You called it chastisements, but how was
it spoken of by the camels?”
“Ye’d better askit them: but I ashume
they were aye ready to see that A was their
natural pro-veedence, chastisin’ them -ecose
A loveit them. A remember whiles A was
at Port Augusty there was a wee cummle we
ca’ed the Snake. He was gey fine an’ hand-
some, pairfectly black, an’ co’ered ower wi’
wee rings o’ black hayre. An’ in temper he
wus Auld Clootie himsel’.
“ ’Tw r as a harrd jobe tae pit his nose-paigs
on to him—he made that girnin’ and groanin’
an’ spittin’ his nasty green spittle, an’ his
eye white an’ cauld like an auld witch. But
we fixit his nose-paigs, an’ then we couldna’
brak’ him for a ridin’ cummle. So A pit him
in the pole of a fourteen cummle team that
was takkin stores to Farriny. The black
deil waited until the waggon cam’ to a harrd
piece of th’ rod in little brokken runs o’
limestane stannin’ up oot o’ the ground, an’
then he threw himsel’ doon an’ tore all the
flesh off yin side becos A wadna stope the
team, an’ they draggit him ower the stanes.
When the team had draggit a’ the flesh off

THE EVER-READY HEALER
AND PERFECT SKIN-CURE.
IN the course of her duties the nurse is
brought into contact with every descrip-
tion of skin disease. She is also brought
to fully realise the need for a reliable healing
balm which can be applied to diseased and
wounded skin with every confidence that
only good will result.
The fact that hundreds of nurses use
Zam=Buk in the course of their
duties is further proof, if such were
needed, that in Zam-Buk the public
is furnished with a reliable healing
balm and skin-cure, the purity and
power of which cannot be denied.
Below we quote the opinion of three of the many trained
nurses who have written in praise of Zam=Buk.

WOUNDED, INFLAMED HAND
THAT WOULD NOT HEAL.
Nurse Oprav, residing at 31 King Street,
Prahran, Melbourne, adds her name to the
already long list of professional practitioners
who speak in praise of Zam-Buk. “I suffered
from a terribly bad hand,” says the nurse,
‘‘which was caused through knocking it against
a door. Inflammation set in, my hand com-
menced to swell up, and the pain was so great
I could do nothing with it. I was out nursing
at the time, but I was forced to give it up. All
the remedies I tried failed to do any good, and
at the end of three months my hand was get-
ting worse instead of better. A friend advised
me to u§e Zam-Buk. The benefit 1 derived
from the first few applications was very encour-
aging. After a while the wound was cleansed
and purified, ' and the healing. process rapidly
set in. New healthy skin grew over the wound,
and my hand was as sound and strong as ever.
I recommend it to all.”

Colic, Diarrhoea and Dysentery
Are diseases that require immediate attention. In almost every neighbourhood
someone has died from these diseases before medicine could be procured or a
physician summoned.
Those who rely upon physicians often find that they are away from home when
most needed.
Every family, and especially those who reside in the back blocks, should keep
at hand a bottle of Chamberlain’s Colic & Diarrhoea Remedy.
No physician can prescribe a better medicine for the purpose for which it is
intended. It is invaluable for both children and adults.

his rubs o’ the near-side, he threw himsel’
ower an’ tore the flesh o’ his off-side inti)
whirrligugs. So we had to take him oot. o’
the team an' rest him for three months to
heal the wounds he made thryin’ to commit
sooioide.
"1 mind one day passin’ him in the pad-
dock. He chewed his cud an' split his tope
lup at me in derision. An' then I said to
mesel : ‘Gode gave man dominion ower the
beasts, an’ A’ll hae domeenion ower you, ma
black scoondrell, th’ morrn’s morrn.’
“By exercisin’ th’ patience o’ Jobe an' the
cunnin’ o’ th’ blude hoond the morrn we
threw the Snake an’ nose-paiged him doon
to his ain legs, an’ his legs were strappit.
an’ whiles he thried to groan he got his
mouth filled wi’ dust, so by-an'-bye he keepit
his breath to cool his brose. I pit on him a
patent new-fangled saddle A had from Port
Augusty, an’ A strappit. ma. new rug ower
it. An’ A cut me sax feet o’ nummher eight
fencin’ wire, an’ A twisted up nine inches
to a foot of the tope end to mak’ me a
liau’nle for ma hand. An A mounted the
Snake, an’ I give him a long an’ most
agonisin’ pull o' the reins so that he wad
ken a real mon was hangin’ to his nose, an’
then A gave the worrd to let loose his legs.
An’ then A caught him a fearfu’ whack ower
the offside ear to gie him his bearin’s.
“He uttered a scream like a burrnin’
horse, mon, an’ he jumpit up as quick as a
scaldit doggie. His heid was in the air as
quick as his sterrn nearly, an’ that’s no
cammle nature. An A was sure the Deil
was in him after that, the black wastrel.
He tore off blind an’ screamin’, an’ I guided
him to the gate, but he made fo' another
gate wi’ a cap piece ower it. The cunnin’
beastie wantit to scrape me off his back by
the cap piece, but 1 beent doon by the side
o’ his hump an’ got through. He ran on like
a ravenin’ tiger, tryin’ to dash ma brains
oot against the owerhangin’ branches o’
gum threes; but I pulled the nose oot of him
nearly, an’ beat him wi’ the number eight
fencin wire.
“Still gruntin’ an' groanin’ wi’ the Deil
in him I whippit him back to the homestead
yarrd, an’ he ran sideways through the gates
an’ thried to smash ma legs against the
possts. An' the Deil was roarin’ in him, an’
I said : ‘l’ll mak ye a Creestian before A’m
done wi’ ye.’
“In the yarrd there was a coolin’ house
for the milk, wi’ a, low doreway an’ the roof
thatchit wi’ rye strow. He made for that
at a. gallop to kill me in the doreway, but
he cud on’y get his heid in. an’ the cross-
pieec caught his hump, an’ he fell doon as if
he was poleaxed, and groaned an’ grinned an’
spat all over the hoose.
“A wasna feelin’ gey fine mesel’. Ma new-
fangled saddle wasna’ a success. Ma rug
slippit off, an’ the saddle was daen to me
what the number eight fencin’ wire was
daein to the wee cummle. But A wadna gie
in. I lambasted him ther wi' half o’ him
inside the milk hoose so that I had to gie
him all the beatin’ asterrn, an’ he wadna get
up. He just stayed there an' groaned, an’ I
sot on his back an’ I said: ‘ ’Tis you or me
for 't, yer black wastrel.’
“Ma arrm was tired so that A cud scarcely
liffit to ma heid, an’ I was thinkin’ A had
to gie in an] fa’ off his cursed back —becoes
A was too tired to get off. An’ then, as it
might be inspeeration, I liftit ma een to the
thatch, an’ the Lorrd pit it into ma mind to
be patient wi’ the beastie an’ gie him anither
chance to mak a man o’ himsel’. A oot wi’
ma knife an’ A cut a handfu’ o’ the thatch,
an’ A struck a match, an’ lichtit the rye
strow, an' when ’twas burrnin’ guid an’ fine
I pit it ahint mean’ warrmed him a wee.
“Mon! He cried like a Creestian, but he
had a harrd hert an’ he wadna gie in.
AVhiles the rye strow burned to ma fingers
I cut mair rye strow an lichtit again, an’ he
wadna gie in. I burned a’ the strow I could
reach wi’oot gettin’ oot o’ the saddle, an’
that wad hae made him the maister, so I
wadna leave the saddle.
“Jus’ as I was thinkin’ I must gie in A
got anither inspeeration. Wi’ the lower end
o’ ma whip I made me a hook, an’ I hooked
a big o’ th’ thatch an’ brote it near
ma hand an’ tore it oot an’ lichtit it. An’
at that burrnin’ the cummle bellered like a
bool. An’ then he stoppit the groanin’, an’
he backit oot o’ the milk hoose, an’ stood up,
answerin’ the rein, an’ A rode him roond the
yarrd, an’ hooshtaed him doon, an’ he went
on his knees like a bairn wi’ the big tears
in his een. An’ after that he was a good
felly—the best r’din’ cummle atween Fariny
an’ Porrt Augusty, an' he wad eat oot o’ ma
hond. Ah, a fine kind Creestian beastie was
the Snake; afther he had his wee bit chas-
tisement.”
“Rut —cruelty—Billy ?”
“No —no, laddie, no cruelty ! They’re
Code’s creatures —the same as you an’ me,
laddie.”

I once became the proprietor of a hornbill
in Papua—a sort of large, flat-footed crow
with a beak as large and hard and predatory
as the collective Ten Tribes who were lost in
Syria, and unfortunately were found in Lon-
don. I was very good to that hornbill; yet
he died, partly to spite me, partly because,
in ignorance of his usual dietary of rats and
cockroaches, I tried to make him a vege-
tarian with bananas. But Pat McGalty slew
his turtle, though the underlying cause was
an ignorance of the habits and food of
turtles and a desire for revenge growing out
of the erroneous impression that the turtle
was an ingrate and a slighter of favors.
“They do be queer tings, thim turtle,” said
McGalty to me. “Do you know ’tis like
killin’ a steel black beetle.”
“Is it, Pat?”
“ ’Tis truth I’m tellin’. An’ conthrairy
cross-grained pigs, that’s what they are, me
man. I’ll tell you, ’twas whin I had a hotil
in Barcaldin’. That do be a long way from
the coast, an’ he keem up be train. A frind
sint him to me—he capshered him on the
Grate Barrier Reef, an’ he w’as a. sulky
divil. There he had been on the thrain
thravellin’ like a Governor-Gineral in his
nice box wit sawdust in it.”
I said that a turtle hated sawdust—that a
grain of it under his flipper would make any
turtle discontented, and that a turtle’s idea
of happiness is to eat seaweed and cool his
tail in the Pacific.
“You said you didn’t know anyt’ing about
turrtles,” replied McGalty. An’ what should
you know about turrtles, to be sure?”
“Natural history studies.”
“Never mind yure natural histries! I will
give you exshperience—exshperience an’
facts. Lissen to me now. The turrtle came
to me hotil an’ I put him in the horse yarrd
wit about two fate o’ soft dried horse
manure to make his bed. Next morning he
was gone. We searrch for him, an’ we find
him thravelling. a great stage for him. He
was a hundred fate out o’ the yarrd an’ into
the sehrub. So I bought him a clothes-line,
an 'it cost, me tinpince it, did : an’ I put him
back into the horse yarrd, an' tied the
clothes-line to wan of his front arrums, an’
he thried to pay me by bitin’ me fingers off.
Thrit will show you what a discontintid
beast he was.”
“His flipper was easily bruised, l sup-
pose ?”
“Oh. yis. You would make excuses for a
murderer, would yourself. Well. I tln-eated
him like wan o’ the family, I did. I kept
two tables at me hotel in Barcaldin’ —a
shillin’ table an’ a half-crown table. An’
d’ye know this, me bold buck that would
make excuses for chross-grained turrtles—
we never sent that turrtle anything from the
shillin’ table. ’Twas all from the half-crown
table —cutlets wit’out a! tooth in them, nluni
puddin’. roast porrk, half av a duck, and
dhrumsticks av chookens, asparygus, an'
potato salad, an’ cream puffs, an’ apple
tarrts. An the ongrateful thing wouldn’t
ate! He crawled along on his nice l dhry
horrse manure, an’ whin y’wd go to him in
the morrnin’ he would tak his head inside
his house an’ sulk wit himself.
“An’, says I, ‘l’m the masther of the
house, an’ I’ll have nobody sulky wit me
under me own roof.’ So I took me head-
waither an’ a new American axe. an’ I win!
to the yarrd to kill him. His head was in
his house, but the liead-waither pulled out
a. shnake’s lent’ of it —his neck was about
tree or four feet in lent’ —an’ I lifted up the
axe to cut ’s head off. We put some of his
neck over a firewood billet an’ made him
comf’able to die, but the discontintid beast
he see the axe cornin’ down, an’ he pulled
his neck in as if he was coilin’ a garden-hos \
an’ I nearly cut off the head-waitiler’s hand.
What are yer laffin’ at? ’Tis no joke to cut
off the waither’s hand. ’Twould cost me
four hundred pound undher the Workmin’s
Compinsation Liability Act. So I got me
wife to hold his head out while I killt urn.
“I near cut off the pore woman’s hand,
too —poor Honora! She dhropped his head
whin the axe came down, an’ the cowardly
baste, he pulled his neck inside his house an'
he wouldn’t show an eye.
“Well, I t’ought an’ I t’ought. an' I
t’ought an’ I found a way. An’ i ses: ‘We'll
see, me buck, who’s the licensee av this
hotil—Pathrick Aloyius McCarty or Mister
Cross-grained Turrtle. We’ll see if you’ll
keep your head in your house whin I
wan’t to cut your neck off. me lad !
“I sharpened me new axe, an’ I kem be-
hind him while he was sulkin’, an’ I broke
through his roof —he have a. shell like cor-u-
-gated iron, me man. he have that. An’ whin
I was finished wit’ ’im the place was like th’
Twelft’ of July for blood an’ bones. An’ me
doin’ me best to make his life happy an’ him
sulky wit’ me in me own house.”
Even a turtle can be misunderstood.

The Dry Horrors.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AS we got off the ramshackle bone-
bruising r shanghai at Jumping Sand-
hills the burly publican came out of
the bar.
“Any of yous bloques for dinner?” be
asked.
“Yes,” said I, “we two and the driver.”
“Rightoh ! Acourse bein’ drooght time, I
kin only give yous goat or galah. Which’ll
yav ?”
“Goat.” said I.
“Galantine of galah,” said my mate. He
added : “We can’t tackle that tucker till we
wash some of the dust down our throats.
What’ll you have, Sandy?”
“A little whisky and a lot of water,” I
replied.
As we were drinking in marched a swag-
gie. He pitched Matilda into a corner, and
asked for a long beer. It was swallowed in-
stantly.
“Gis another two, boss,” and they were
also tossed off with marvellous suddenness.
The swaggie walked out and sat on the far
end of the long verandah stool-
“ He’s a bit of a beer-chewer, boss,” said
I to the publican.
“No bloomin’ fear. He’s rather a stiddy
bloke, but he’s sufferin’ fr’m th’ dry ’orrors.”
“The what?”
“Th’ dry ’orrers. Y’ see he's bin’ nout. on
a back station all through this drooght,
tank-sinkin’, an’ ’is innards is got all
parched tup. The firs’ beer only got down
tabout ’ere” (indicating the top button of
the vest). “Th’ seeon’ beer got a bit more
furder. Th’ intestins ov ’is throat sucks up
th’ beer before it gits a charnct ta. trickle
fur. Th’ third beer got near inter his stum-
mick. Presen’ly bits o' th’ beers will grease
’is swaller all th’ way down, an’ he’ll come
in fa. th’ fourth beer. That one ought ta git
right there- —if it does yu’ll see ’im smile
contented-like, an' ’e’ll arsk yous two an’
me tav a. drink with’ im. He never shouts
till th’ beer ’as reached ’is stummick. It’s
terrible cruel tav th’ dry ’orrers, because ya
carn’t git th’ leas’ bit a taste outer th’ first
three a four beers, an’ that seems a terrible
waste a good stuff. I hope yous two chaps
never gets th’ dry ’orrers.”
We cordially agreed.
As we were about to have a. second drink
the desiccated swaggie came in again.
“Have a drink, matey?” I asked.
“Not jus’ yet. I’m havin’ this fourth one
on me own. If it gits inter tli’ homestead
paddiek I’ll join yous.”
He called for a. long beer, which he drank
very slowly and deliberately. He stood still
as if thinking after he had drained the glass.
All at once he turned to us, his countenance
curiously corrugated with the broadest of
jolly, satisfied grins.
“Now, I’ll have one with yous, for th’
fourth beer has got through the sliprails.”
He had one with us. We had one with
him. The publican shouted. After that we
all went in to goat and galah, and had a
good meal.
“Mind ya,” said the swaggie, “I’ve had
for worse attacks than this one. Th’ boss
here kin tell yu that sometimes I have ta
drink fa th’ best part of a day before th’ hop
juice gets right home. I hope yous blokes
never git th’ dry ’orrers. They’re terrible
tryin’ ta th’ temper.”
