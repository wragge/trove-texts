HUDSON’S EUMENTHOL TOOTH
SECURES SOUND WHITE TEETH
Some practical reasons why Hudson’s Eumenthol
Tooth Powder should be used for the
Preservation of the Teeth.
BECAUSE it contains the Germicidal and Antiseptic virtues that
have made Eumenthol Jujubes famous the world over.
BECAUSE it is not only an Antiseptic and Germicide, but cleanses
mechanically, owing to the evolution of oxygen when in con-
tact with water or moisture.
BECAUSE it is the oxygen which whitens the Teeth so wonder-
fully, and wards off decay as no other preparation for the
Teeth can or will do.

The Red Page
War is War
Pliillip Gibbs, author of The Street of
Advent, lire., has written, so far, the finest
book upon the war. His aim in The Soul of
the War (Heinemann, 7s. 6d. in England),
is “to -reveal the soul of war so nakedly
that it cannot be glossed over by the glamor
of false sentiment and false heroics.”
A man with a pen in his hand must use it
to tell the truth about the monstrous horror,
to etch its images of cruelty into the brains
of liis readers, and to tear down the veils by
which the leaders of the peoples try to con-
ceal its obscenities. The conscience of Europe
must not be lulled to sleep again by the nar-
cotics of old phrases about “the ennobling in-
fluence of war” and its “purging fires.”....
The Germans have revealed the meaning of
war, the devilish soul of it, in a full and
complete way, with a most ruthless logic.
The chiefs of their great soldier caste have
been more honest than ourselves in the busi-
ness, with the honesty of men who, knowing
that war is murder, have adopted the methods
of murderers, whole-heartedly, with all the
force of their intellect and genius, not weak-
ened by any fear of public opinion, by any
prick of conscience, or by any sentiment of
compassion. Their logic seems to me flaw-
less. though it is diabolical....
Why be illogical and pander to false senti-
ment? Why not sink the Lusitania and set
the waves afloat with the little corpses of
children and the beauty of dead women? It
is but one more incident of horror in a war
which is all horror. Its logic is unanswer-
able in the Euclid of Hell. It is war, and
when millions of men set out to kill each
other, to strangle the enemies’ industries, to
ruin, starve and annihilate him so that the
women may not breed more children, and so
that the children shall perish of wide-spread
epidemics, then a few laws of chivalry, a
little pity here and there, the recognition of
a Hague Treaty, are but foolishness, and the
weak jugglings of men who try to soothe
their conscience with a few drugged tab-
loids. That at least is the philosophy of the
German war lords, and granted the premises
that war may be waged by one people against
another it seems to me sound and flawless in
its abomination.
Yet the book, brilliantly written, is no
book of horrors. There is chivalry in it,
humor in it, courage and bravery and hope
in it. Phillip Gibbs has been a year amongst
the horrors of the firing line ; he has been
again and again under fire; he has done
useful and dangerous work with the Red
Cross; he knows every mark of the beast.
And his record is actual: he is an eye-
witness who sees not only with his trained
eyes but with soul —a rather unusual Eng-
lish soul. His is a big book, a brave book.
Read it.
It was chiefly with the French army that
this correspondent was, for correspondents
were not encouraged by the British army.
He gives a vivid picture, not of the French
army, but of the men who make up that
composite mass. And his account of that
tremendous smashing attack of the great
German battering ram through amazed Bel-
gium and unready France is finely done.
He became so used to the exodus of the Bel-
gians before that mighty stream of grey
that: —•
I came to think the world must always
have been like this, with people always in
flight, families and crowds of families drift-
ing about aimlessly, from town to town, get-
ting into trains just because they started
somewhere for somewhere else, sitting for
hours on bundles which contained all their
worldly goods saved from the wreckage of
ancient homes, losing their children on the
roadside and not fretting very much, and
finding other children, whom they adopted as
their own; never washing on that wander-
ing. so that delicate women* who had once
been perfumed with fine scents were dirty
as gypsies and unashamed of draggled
dresses and dirty hands; eating when they
found a meal of charity, sleeping in railway
sidings, coalsheds and derelict trains shunted
on to grass-covered lines; careless as pariah
dogs of what the future held in store now
that they had lost all things in the past.
A sidelight on that great German south-
ern drive is that all this subsequent “Fight
for Calais” might have been unnecessary.
Gibbs found that
The ports of France had been abandoned.
They lay open to the enemy, and if any
Uhlans came riding in, or a German officer
in a motor-car with three soldiers to repre-
sent an army, Calais and Boulogne would
be surrendered without a shot .It is amaz-
ing to remember that in the last days of
August (1914) Calais was offered as a free
gift, with Boulogne and Dieppe to follow, if
they cared to come for them. Even
was to be abandoned as the British base....
The new base was to be m-.eii rurther south,
-at St. Nar<a:re.
jt
Of that heroic retreat from Mons Gibbs
tells the uncensored truth: —
The retreat of the British army—it is
amazing to think that there were only
45,000 men who had tried to stem the Ger-
man avalanche —was developing into a run.
Only some wild fluke of chance (the pious
patriot sees God’s hand at work, while the
cynic sees only the inefficiency of the German
staff) saved it from becoming a bloody rout.
lt was called a “retirement in good
order.” It was hardly that when the Com-
mander-in-Chief had to- make a hurried flight
with a mounted escort, when the Adjutant-
General’s department, busy in the chateau
of a French village, suddenly awakened to
the knowledge that it had been forgotten and
left behind (I heard the personal story of the
escape that followed the awakening), and
when companies, battalions and regiments
lost touch with each other, were bewildered
in dark woods and unknown roads, and were
shelled unexpectedly by an enemy of whose
whereabouts they had now no definite know-
ledge.... But the enemy was exhausted also.
Their pursuit was a chase by blown horses
and puffed men. They called a halt and
breathed freely, at the very time when a last
gallop and a hard fight would have given
them their prize—the flower of the British
army.
And there were desertions —there could
hardly not have been desertions. Boor boys
cold with the horror of this terrible war-
fare, who had “lost” - their regiments and
did not go to find them, telling “wild, in-
coherent tales, when cornered at last by some
cold-eyed officer in some town in France to
which they had blundered.” Some were shot
—the stern justice of war, but Gibbs, like
us, does not blame them.
Gibbs 'found Paris open to the enemy.
Paris had been girdled with forts on the
east
But on the western side there was next to
nothing, and it was a sign to me of the
utter unreadiness of France that now at the
eleventh hour when I passed, thousands pf
men were digging trenches with frantic
haste. Great God! that such work should
not have been done weeks before, and not left
like this to a day when the enemies’ guns were
rumbling through Creil and smashing back
the allied armies in retreat... .All the north-
west corner of France was denuded of
troops, with the exception of some poor
territorials, ill-trained and ill-equipped....
The forts on the western side of Paris would
not have held out for half a day against the
German guns.... Yon Ivluck had 24 hours in
his favor. He Joes not seem to have
known that the French army was in des-
perate need of those 24 hours which he gave
them by his hesitation.... Yon Ivluck could
have entered and held Paris with 20,000 men.
.... The Headquarters Staff of the German
army decided otherwise.
And Joffre’s genius, by a brilliant stroke
of strategy, which repaired all the errors of
the first six weeks of the war, dealt the
Huns a staggering and decisive blow.
J*
Extremely interesting to us, who have no
frontier but our own seas, is Gibbs’s exami-
nation of the influence of a frontier, occu-
pied by a foreigner, upon the psychology of
a people:—
The military training which is compulsory
for all young men, not only shapes their
bodies but also shapes their minds. They
know that they have been born of women
for one primary object—to fight when the
time comes in defence of the Fatherland, to
make one more brick in the great wall of
blood and spirit dividing their country and
race from some other country and race....
The difference between the intellectual in-
stincts of an island people and that of a
continental race was the cause of the slow
way in which England groped her way to
an understanding of the present war.
And, in order to bring home what invasion
was to France, the author merely localises in
London one of a hundred stories he had
heard. Let us localise his story in Sydney:
You leave your office in _ Pitt-street and
take the North Shore train to Waitara,
where your wife and children are waiting
dinner for you. At Roseville the train comes
to a dead-halt. The guard runs up to the
engine-driver and comes back to say that the
line has been blown up by the enemy. It is
reported that Waitara has been invaded.
Families flying from Waitara describe the
bombardment of that suburb. A part of
it is in flames. Many inhabitants have been
killed. Most of the others have fled:
You who were going home to dinner want
to set out to find your wife and children.
Your friends hold you back. “You are mad!”
they shout.... You have no dinner at home
that night. Your dinner and your home
have been burnt to cinders. For weeks you
advertise in the papers for the whereabouts
of your wife and babes. Nobody can tell
you. You do not know whether they are
alive or dead.
There are thousands of such cases in
France.
And Gibbs tells another story. A group
of English officers were, after 10 months of
war, thinking 'dL'lwlr homes in England,
because it was April. One man read out the
gay little letter of his pretty daughter, tell-
ing of her simple home-life. Other men gave
themselves away and revealed the sentiment
which, as a rule, Englishmen hide. But in
the room was a French officer, who sat very
still. At last he said:—
“It is good for you Englishmen when you
go back home. Those who are not killed
out here will be very happy to see their
women again. You do not want to die
because of that If I were to go home
now. gentlemen, I should not be happy. I
should find my wife and my daughter both
expecting babies whose fathers are German
soldiers England has not suffered inva-
sion.”
And this is not an isolated case. Has
anyone of us visualised the meaning of that
long black line that is marked on the maps
running from Switzerland to the English
Channel ? Gibbs pictures for us the
blackness of all those burnt and shattered
villages, for ten miles in width, on that
border-line of the war-trail: —
I wonder how many people, searching for
news of heroic bayonet charges or for thrill-
ing stories of how Private Smith kept an
army corps at bay, single-handed, with a
smile on his face, saw even faintly the flight
of all the fugitives from that stricken zone,
the terror of women and children trapped in
its hell-fire, and the hideous obscenity of that
long track across the fields of France, where
dead bodies lay rotting in the rain and sun,
and the homesteads of a simple people lay in
heaps from Artois to Lorraine?
In the field hospitals where Gibbs labored
he visualises more of the hell that is war:
The smell of wet and muddy clothes, coag-
ulated blood and gangrened limbs, of iodine
and chloroform, sickness and sweat of agony,
made a stench which struck one’s senses with
a foul blow. I used to try and close my
nostrils to it, holding my breath lest I should
vomit. I used to try to keep my eyes on the
ground, to avoid the sight of those smashed
faces, and blinded eyes, and tattered bodies.
.... I tried to shut my ears to the hideous
snuffle of men drawing their last breaths, the
long-drawn moans of men in devilish pain,
the ravings of fever-stricken men.
“Be careful,” said the nurse, as Gibbs
was helping to carry out a corpse. “He
might fall in half.”
3
There are, it appears, very few men who
are not afraid of shell-fire. There are fewer
who pretend that they are not afraid. Gibbs
describes the effect upon the faces of men
who liaA'e experienced it. Their faces were
dead. It seemed as if their vital spark had
been already put out by the storm of battle.
“Fear exists with the highest valor.”
Shell-fire is not an ordinary test of cour-
age. Courage is annihilated in the face of it.
Something else takes its place —a philosophy
of fatalism, sometimes an utter boredom....
In most cases a strange extinction of all emo-
tions and sensations, so that men who have
been long under shell-fire have a peculiar
rigidity of the nervous system, as if some-
thing had been killed inside them.... I was
conscious (under shell-fire) of great physical
discomfort which reacted upon my brain.
The noises were even more distressing to me
than the risk of death.... Shocks which
shattered into one’s brain and shook one’s
body with a kind of disintegrating tumult.
More awful was the noise of our own guns.
Every shell which they sent made one’s
body and soul quake with the agony of its
noise. The vibration was so great that it
made my skull ache as though it had been
hammered. Long afterwards I found myself
trembling with those waves of vibrating
sounds. Worse still, because sharper and
more piercingly staccato, was my experience
close to a battery of French cent-vingt. Each
shell was fired with a hard, metallic crack,
which seemed to knock a hole into my ear-
drums .... Three men out of six or seven,
a tough, hard type of mechanic, had to be
invalided home in one week. One of them
had a crise de ncrfs which nearly killed
him. Yet it was not fear which was the
matter with them. It was the intolerable
strain upon the nervous system that made
wrecks of them.... Men who have been in
the trenches under heavy shell-fire, some-
times for as long as three days, come out of
their torment like men who have been buried
alive. They have the brownish, ashen color
of death. They tremble as through anguish.
They are dazed and stupid for a time. But
they go back. That is the marvel of it.
They go back day after day, as the Belgians
went day after day No one with an
imagination ought to come out to this war.
The man who reads this book will learn
what war is. Then it is up to him quickly
to decide what steps he is going to take to
help win this war so completely that the
very word, with all its horrible implications,
will be banished from this globe.
•
A useful chronology of European En-
tanglements since 17.'/8 (Longmans, Green,
per George Robertson, Is.) has been com-
piled by Haward Chambers. The editor has
marshalled in order the chief alliances, trea-
ties, wars and transferences of territory
among the European Powers since that date,
in order to make the present situation more
easily understood. Astonishing that in so
many of these years that were unmarked by
great wars so many transferences of terri-
tory and regroupings of the Powers should
have occurred ! Apparently it was time
that Europe was shaken out of her condition
of unstable equilibrium.
The latest issues of the shilling pocket
edition of the World’s Classics (Milford,
Oxford University Press) are: Six Eliza-
bethan Plays by Contemporaries of Shake-
speare (one vol.), and two volumes of Pres-
cott’s History of the Conquest of Mexico.
Classics are works which everybody pre-
sumes everybody else to have read, which
naturally absolves anybody from taking the
trouble to read them. But sometimes they
aren’t any trouble at all.
In Longman’s “Technical Handicraft”
series {per George Robertson, 2s. 6d.) the
latest volume deals with :The Motor Car.
The mere lack of a car prevents this page
from giving this handbook the critical notice
that it presumably merits. ' mm
Scotland for Ever, a gift-book recording
the valor of famous Scottish regiments, antT
containing admirably reproduced illustra-
tions in color of famous historical battle
paintings, recounting the story of the Scot in'
warfare from Fontenoy to the veldt, is pub-
lished for the Glasgow Herald by Hodder
and Stoughton, for the ridiculously _ small
sum of 3s. Ridiculously small, that is, for
patriotic Scotsmen. All profits go to the
Scottish branch of the British Red Cross
Society.
-‘Harrison O.” wishes to intimate: —
“Arnold Bennett is not a dramatist,” declares the
Red Page (22/7/’l5). I wish to intimate, with a
due sense of responsibility, that I am getting tired
of these critical snorts to the effect that some of
the most successful modern stage writers —Shaw,
Barker, Barrie, Bennett and others —may be various
admirable things, but are “not dramatists.” There
seems to be a notion in some quarters that to be
a dramatist it is essential to observe the rules and
regulations of the Pinero-Jones-Grundy-Carton school.
It should be only necessary to name one play.
Milestones (in the making of which a minor dramatic
hack played a minor part), to. show that Bennett s
claim to be considered a leading dramatist is by
no means contemptible. This comedy was one of
the most charming and thoroughly artistic things
seen here for years, and the Red Page itseli has
said as much. Then there are The Great Adventure
—a good plot, several capital character studies and
clever, witty dialogue—and What the Public Wants.
Here are three plays that have earned bouquets
from critics and shekels from the public (I mention
the latter fact to show that they must possess some-
thing other than mere “literary’’ qualities), and yet
it is coollj r remarked that the author of them is not
a dramatist!
[This page never said that Shaw, Barker or Barrie
were not dramatists, and apparently Ham son u.
does not mean to imply that this page said ,lt.
Nor does this page think that a dramatist mus
observe the Pinero rules. But this page r ®P
that Bennett is not a dramatist. W hat the Pubne
Wants is just what its title implies—a play of the
Jones-Grundv-Carton school. In The Great Ad
tv re, an incredibly clumsy dramatisation ot a
Bennett novel, this alleged dramatist had to
practically eight acts in order to put bis P
story on the stage. It two delightful
characters—characters taken from his novel,
don’t know how much of Milestones Bennett did,
but the probability is not much. The minor dramatic
hack” who, according to “Harrison O. s ibide m
formation, “played a minor part m the codcoeUori’
has a record of plays both before he collaborated
with Bennett and after. Knoblauch «
credit The Faun, Kismet, and now a Q
original play, Marir-Odile. Pretty good for a mmo
dramatic hack ! When Bennett himsejf ■ _P r °
play up to the standard of any of these , in
lauoh’s, the Red Page will be pleased to heai agan
from “Harrison O.”J '?
GALLIPOLI, 1915.
,1 boxing tourney without gloves or a
referee;
A football match without an umpire or spec-
tators;
A game of golf with, steel balls and red
flesh for bunkers;
Another bout for the victor
And a grave for the vanquished:
This is War.
Drab vessels in a silken bag
Vomiting fighters and tubloidcd death;
Sea-salt rankling in raw, aching wounds;
A claioing at sand walls and stunted bushes
Minus the martial music and the pomp
That gather round great deeds in piping
Peace,
When Governors lay foundation-stones;
A tuneless medley of banal cries J
Ringing like clarion calls;
Torn tunics splattered thick with Asian
blood ;
The red sun glittering on reddened steel;
And the mad joy of the super-hunt;
Loud cries for Allah;
Shrill shrieks of the disembowelled;
The sullen flopping of the pierced of heart;
The fantastic stagger with the punctured
brain;
Humming pellets and the dolorous boom of
guns;
Husked throats and tired limbs;
The racked agony of men with slaughter sick
Who kill again;
This is Gallipoli’s hell-haunted coast
When Death slipped the leash V .
And a new nation stormed its legended
shores.
These are the fragmentary details that filter
through the Censor's office.
Deeds of men who succored dying sheep
And drove gaunt cattle along dusty roads to
water,
Or scored dull figures all day long in ledgers
Till Fate’s wheel turned ■
And made them warriors in ancient lands.
Men who faced an unknown hell
With a grin and a casual curse, - t
Men who hung on when the bottom seem-
ingly dropped out of things;
Full-blooded men who did a thorough job
Because it was their custom; %
Dead wen who bequeathed a word to rouse
sore smitten comrades
By Southern Seas
And mangrove swamps and mulga scrub
In the dark days to come '■ ,V;.
When alien hordes press on us;
The cry that will ring triumphant
From Storm Bay to the northern Gulf
In all the grim days of Australia’s travail,
Gallipoli! Gallipoli!

“There is no need to tell people who

wonderful results of
Clements
Tonic”
Mrs. Mary Ethel Hoare, wife of the
officer in charge of the Police
Station, Guildford, N.S.W., writes of
her recovery:
Police Station,
Guildford, N.S.W., 2/l/’l5.
CLEMENTS TONIC, LTD.
“My restoration to perfect health has been so wonderful
that I feel that I cannot let this opportunity pass without
letting you know for the benefit of other people the wonderful
results of Clements Tonic.
“For about five years I SUFFERED DREADFULLY FROM
NERVOUS BREAKDOWN and INSOMNIA. The least thing
would send my whole body into a tremble. I would shake all
over.
“I tried medical treatment, but I gradually grew worse.
I could not eat or sleep. I HAD GIVEN UP ALL HOPE OF
EVER BEING WELL AGAIN, when a friend advised me to
try Clements Tonic.
“There is no need to tell people who saw me two years
ago, and who can see me now, of the wonderful results of
Clements Tome, for from the first bottle I commenced to get
better, and after I had taken six bottles I WAS RESTORED
TO PRESENT STATE OF HEALTH, WHICH IS PERFECT.
. ' ol i are at Perfect liberty to make what use you think fit

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Two Fishermen.
Down in the cove at the dawn of day
Two fishermen cast their net;
The waters still as a mirror lay
With never a wind to fret.
With brown arms willing, each plied his
part,
And hauled on his weed-tressed rope ;
And each had a grey, grey doubt at heart
That jostled a glowing hope.
Alight with promise the eastern sky
Grew red as a new-made bride;
Its rose-hues gilded the hilltops nigh,
And kindled the sleeping tide.
The Sea. at times, is a fearsome foe,
And, at times, a gracious friend ;
And each man asked in that morning glow—
“ Now what will the great Sea send?”
On some she smiles through the golden days,
And frowns to the last on some.
For some her tide is at ebb always,
And at laughing flood for some.
The dawn-glow grew in the eastern sky
To a splendid miracle;
On cove and cavern and coast-cliff high
A wonder of rose-light fell.
A sea-hawk rose in a wheeling flight,
And a bird trilled sweet and thin;
And each man asked in the new-born light—
“ Now what will our net bring in?”
Then, all at once, at the song of the bird,
A breeze through the wood-ways ran ;
Around the cove a murmur stirred,
And a prattle of waves began.
The net drew nigh to the watching men,
And each had his heart’s dear wish —
A moment of thanks... .a shout.. . .and then
A turmoil of gleaming fish.
A blaze, a splendor on leaf and limb,
And lo! in the east the sun
Looked down on a world that watched for
him,
And a new day well begun.
N.S.W.
RODERIC QUINN.
Number Eighty-three.
Stern-fronting the suburban tide,
It stares across the dusty street,
And, closely hedged on either side,
Treads hard upon its neighbors’ feet.
Its curtained windows strove to hold
The secrets eager eyes would seek,
As some soft maiden’s wimple fold
Would hide the blushes on her cheek!
But every night a crazy thing,
When all the street was dark and late,
Would lift a drunken chant and bring
His lurching presence through the gate.
A poor, weak fellow, in whose life
Romance and Love were cold and dead;
Who faltered at the call of strife,
And dreamed his little dream instead.
Now, every man w r ho dreams must keep
One hand upon the bridle rein;
Lest high Resolve be lulled to sleep,
And every dream he dreamed in vain!
And there by day a fragile form.
All weak with weariness and pale.
Would walk to where the sun was warm
With one white hand upon the rail.
Or in that small verandah place
Would sit with half-averted head,
Lest men should learn it from her face,
Lest women-folk should see her dread.
Yet every man in passing saw
The message written plainly there—
The terror of the life she bore,
And for the life she soon would bear.
And never old-wife walking near
But knew the message written plain,
And dreamed again her bridal year,
And felt her love-child stir again.
To-day the watchers knew no trace
Of her, yet women passing nigh
Did pause awhile before the place
So they might hear a tiny cry.
To-night the echoing pavement bore
A drunken freight with ribald note,
Till, passing through the quiet door,
Fear choked the laughter in his throat.
And from that shadowed house he came
Wide-eyed and pallid with affright, .
Sobbing and calling her by name,
And stumbling, stumbling toward the
light!
MAORILANL).
BOYCE BOWDEN.
Fort Franklin.
I remember Franklin—
The South Channel, smooth and grey;
The hidden guns at practice
Beside the quiet bay ;
The gunners standing on the cliff
As the roaring dies. away.
And I think of the Dardanelles,
Where the gunners are to-day.
I remember Franklin—
The barracks in the moonlight,
And the ringing bugle
That said a brave good-night.
And I think of Gaba Tepe,
The broad trail of the fight.
And fallen men in the wheel-tracks
Where the guns went up the height.
I remember Franklin;
The night-tide creeping,
The hush after the bugle,
And the soldiers sleeping.

THE STORY ON A BRICK AND THE
SHOCK OF GETTING SOBER.
Though the shiek Amussaluff, who with
his tribe occupied the oasis of Mardin,
in the hinterland of Algiers, has done
duty as an Awful Warning often enough
since Arkelo committed him to verse
on a baked brick, Time has not yet spoiled
the story’s tragic point. Amussaluff and
his brethren, weary of the hardships of life
under the Ptolemies, wandered away into
the desert with their ox and their ass and
everything that was theirs. At last, stand-
ing on a high place, they saw before them
the palms and grass and water which meant
rest and comfort and safety. It was their
land of promise, and so they called it after
Mardin, the well-beloved. Here food
shoufd be theirs for the mere labor of sow-
ing and harvesting ; dates were in profusion ;
their little flocks would multiply, and all
would be well at last with Amussaluff and
his tribe. So they settled down at Mardin,
and at mid-day lolled in the shade of the
sheltering palm and yarned of the days to
be, and at night worshipped the wild cat.
Life was very good. In the fullness of time
ambassadors visited them from over beyond
and brought frankincense and myrrh and
oil; and though Amussaluff was doing
very well without frankincense and myrrh,
and though he had oil on the premises, he
bought these things in great quantity.
Then the ambassadors departed ; and before
three moons had gone caravans crept in
from north and east and west, led by strange
men with noses like the horn of a half-moon.
They brought with them musical instru-
ments, and plans of things called houses,
and tools to work with, and copper and brass
ornaments and robes of new design. Thus
the family and brethren of Amussaluff
and their sisterhood entered on to a higher
plane, and were instructed by the caravan
proprietors with the queer noses in
the art of getting oil and frankin-
cense and myrrh on tick. They left
their tents and dwelt in marble halls
that they still owed for, and reckoned
that Mardin was at last the hub of the
universe. But it happened that one day a
foraging band of savages arrived on the
high place over beyond Mardin, and, smack-
ing their lips, sat down until eve. Then under-
cover of darkness they fell suddenly upon
the marble halls that been built with lOU’s
and bolted back into the gloom laden with
maidens and loot. When the next cara-
vans turned up and heard of this, the leaders
raised up their voices and said that if
Amussaluff was unable to look after his
niarble halls and Ms maidens and musical
instruments, he had better move out. And
Amussaluff in his pride ran to get
his. scimitar, and his brethren ran to get
their spears; but the scimitars and spears
were old and rusty, and the tribe had for-
gotten how to use them. So Amussaluff
and his people were driven forth from Mar-
din, and their ox and their ass and accumu-
lated marble hall and myrrh were left
behind. Then Arkelo, sitting down and
weeping by the waters of a far river, told the
story of their wanderings, their pride and
their enslavement.

The Bulletin makes no excuse for dig-
ging this dried brick from its ancient dust
and throwing it at Australia, nor for asking
Australians how much longer they are going
to keep the historical parallel going? The
lines of progress from simple virtue to de-
moralising vice run so close that any diver-
gence is due to time and circumstance
alone. In everything that is fundamental
the story of M'ardin is the story of Australia
—except that Mardin is too dead to repent
and. Australia isn’t. Yet maybe the final
reminder has come to Australians, and come
with, bewildering emphasis. Are they going to
heed? Or. are they hoping to do just nothing
except wait till the war is over, in the fatu-
ous hope, that the trade in frankincense and
myrrh with the sons of Abraham will start
again at the old address, and that the palm
will continue to throw its grateful shadow
for the Australian to laze under when the
sun shines hotly? The citizen who enter-
tains any such idea is taking a snake to bed ;
for, whatever may happen, Australia is
never, within the life of people now living,
going to be quite the same place again. And the
time for shaping the public policy of the
nation in recognition of this is now —this day
and this moment. Every hour that it is
deferred makes greater the difficulties. Every
month of shirk is likely to bring a year of
trouble.
* * * *
In some respects the history of Australia
up to the present is one of noble achieve-
ment. There are many line records of
individual and communal accomplishment,
of high ambitious realised. The democratic
ideal, smirched though it has been by un-
worthy hands often enough, has been steadily
kept in view, with results that have given
Australia a place in the world and estab-
lished in the hearts of her children a firm
affection for their birthplace and a passionate
love of freedom. Yet the promises of an
earlier day have in many vital respects not
been realised ; splendid hopes have ended in
disappointment; the people have been led
away into the mulga to chase moths. They
have bartered with too many caravans, dealt
too long with the obliging hawker from far
lands; they have been guilty of prodigal
wastefulness, and have recklessly squandered
and pledged their heritage. They have
wasted time on sham fights about things
that were immaterial, embraced the pallia-
tive as if it were the antidote, sat down
contented to feast at the banquet of loan,
and cheerfully welcomed the unhealthy
bubble of boom and bloat. No level-headed
citizen of the Commonwealth who has
watched the progress of events during the
last quarter of a century—the steady accumu-
lation of debt, the chloroforming of the public
conscience with the anaesthesia of borrowed
gold, the timidity of politicians and their
treachery to principle—has ever had any
doubt about what the end was going to be.
Grave embarrassment was inevitable. A
ghastly war has only brought it along a
little sooner. Had it not been for the out-
rageous spree of the past, Australia would
to-day be facing her trial with serene confi-
dence to shoulder the burden the war casts
upon her. But the cost of the jag has been
the cost of a great war. So we are heavily
burdened before we take up the new load.
* * * *
The wooden-headedness of it all is almost
beyond belief —a great gold-producing coun-
try, which has been selling its public estate
by the million acres, with a public debt of
over three hundred millions, all contracted
in a few years, and those years years of
peace; one of the world’s greatest pastoral
and agricultural countries importing food,
and crying aloud for a little spun wool; a
continent larger than the United States of
America listening to its statesmen declaring
that unless they further pawn the future
the handful of inhabitants will not be able
to get employment; a place where two or
three cities are bursting and rural districts
look like moss-covered pumpkins! These
things—the outward and visible signs of a
democracy selling itself to Fat —would be
inconceivable were they not common know-
ledge. Meantime the people who have thus
pawned themselves and must carry a great
burden of interest carry also on their backs
seven Parliaments, all conducted on the most
sumptuous scale, and (with their trimmings
and trappings and imported figureheads) eat-
ing up about £12,000 a week ! Is this scan-
dal to go on? Are Australians going to
tolerate this abuse of the public purse and
credit until the crack of doom? Are they
going to sit down while they are made poorer
by waste of their substance, and plunged
more deeply into debt by the activities of
these plentiful agents of spending and bor-
rowing and taxing?
After 40 years’ settlement and development of the
territory flanking the Vale of Impossible Carnage
the population had grown on both sides to enor-
mous numbers. The elimate was salubrious, the
administration admirably efficient, the productiveness
of the soil and mines and forests unexampled anywhere,
and the output of the factories colossal. Immigrants
were attracted from all over the world ; the rate of
reproduction surprised even the university professors
in Russia. The new States quickly became more than
self-supporting—they added tremendously to the
riches and commerce of their, home countries. In
time the question arose if there was any need for the
two nations to keep up the war, and then it was
found that, partly owing to legal complications with
the syndicate running the gas barrier and partly
owing to the restricted powers of the Greenland
Government, there was no alternative but to main-
tain the struggle. Though the contract for installing
Hell had been drafted by the most reputable lawyers,
the two countries discovered that it provided for
permanent flames. In addition to this the Green-
land Government had discovered that, though it had
powers to start war and keep war going, it could not
authorise peace except through a Referendum; but
as the Constitution was found defective, in that
appointment of returning-officers was beyond the
Government’s authority, the Courts had ruled that
any Referendum would be a distortion of the national
foundations.
Meanwhile the shares of the Australian co. had
become unpurehasable except by Egyptian million-
aires.
After years of agitation the recalcitrant blubber-
refiners of Greenland were prevailed upon to sanction
an amendment of the Constitution, and after this had
been tested, communiques passed about the seizure of
the gas plant under the law of eminent domain. The
two Governments, however, came to the conclusion
that the best way out of the difficulty would be to
dishonor the syndicate’s quarterly drafts. This was
done on a prearranged date. So the syndicate cut its
loss at Zanzibar, dismantled the works, and the end
of a prolonged war arrived.
Great were the rejoicings. A thousand miles of
flag waved on the breeze, and patriotic speeches were
made from every parapet along the smitten Front.
* * * *
Thus it was that one day, Mary being dead, old
Billo’s thoughts turned lightly towards Love, and
spying a Greenland maiden prayerfully planting
daisies along the pipe line, he wooed and won her.
Thus was founded oh the bones of Old Africa a great
civilisation, brought into being by Private Enterprise
and Australian Research.
PEACE AND HELL AT 5 PER CENT.
An insane story about a great idea: —
The war between Tierra del Fuego and Greenland
had been raging for 17 years, when the Fuegans
received the first request from the Front for rein-
forcements, it being considered by the General-
Accountant Commanding that the men originally
drafted to the fighting- line were getting a bit old
and stale. The communication was printed in the
Cape Horn Vigilant next morning, and appended
thereto was an announcement that numbers 1001 to
2000 would parade for embarkation at 10 o’clock,
their wives, families and household effects to be
assembled at noon three days later, ample time being
thus allowed for packing and getting the washing
done. There was no flurry, no orating, no special
meeting of Parliament, no referendum, no Royal
Commission. Immediately after breakfast numbers
1001 to 2000 went to their divisional depots, and
before mid-day they were well over the horizon west-
ward bound. Three days afterwards two other tran-
sports carrying their families followed. The gaps in the
military establishment were immediately corrected;
industry underwent an automatic readjustment to
the neeessities of a dislocation long provided for. A
poet who wrote something about the last man and
the last shilling- was ordered by the Commissioner
for Keeping- Cool to sit on *an iceberg until he felt
better.
The Front extended across part of Central Africa,
running north-west a thousand miles from Zanzibar.
At the outbreak of hostilities both sides had rushed
to Africa, hurriedly dug themselves in behind barbed
wire, and proceeded to throw bombs at one another’s
burrows. During the first year there were one or two
casualties on either side from tonsilitis, but other-
wise the health of the troops remained good. As it
was impossible to see one another in the daytime,
the dug-outs being so extensive, and fitted with steel
doors, and as it was clearly useless to attempt night
attacks on account of the powerful electric-lights in
use and the doors being kept locked, the divisional
commanders were able to withdraw the soldiers for
rest and recreation. Towns sprang into existence at
the rear, crops were raised, industries and schools
established. The wives of the soldiers and officers
joined their husbands after the first year and the
combatants settled down to ordinary family life, each
man doing one shift a week in the dug-outs, these
being reached by an underground pipe line.
Towards the close of the second year emissaries
arrived from a company in a neutral country, bear-
ing letters of authority from- the combatant Govern-
ments to strengthen the line of defence. This they
accomplished by erecting a series of gas-retorts
outside Zanzibar, and running a 30in. pipe connec-
tion along the entire Front; From this there radiated
a 3in. service pipe to each dug-out, these being in
turn connected with a revolving service-jet mounted
on an aluminium parapet. The line of pipes, the
retorts and gasometers were vested in the company by
special Acts of Parliament passed in Greenland and
Tierra del Fuego, and safety from attack was guaran-
teed the proprietors by all the nations on earth ex-
cept Maoriland, where, owing to the return of the
mutton-birds, the people were too excited to enter
into the necessary recognisances.
The company, which had originated in Australia,
had up to this time supplied all Europe with its
patent defence plant, the equipment running along
the frontiers and seaboards of every country. The
company, in return for 5 per cent, on expenditure
and payment of all salaries, guaranteed to keep up a
full supply of inflammable gas at continuous pres-
sure not below 1701 b. per square inch. As this gas
could by the automatic igniting and projecting appar-
atus on each service pipe be distributed in a sheet of
flame having a temperature of 270 deg. Fahr. over
an arc coming within the circumference of the ser-
vice from the next pipe (they were at intervals of
1200 yards), it will be seen that when all the taps
were on and everything was in full blast the Front
was a fairly hot place. “War is. Hell,” the patentee
had remarked to his Board of directors. And they
made a good imitation of it.
* * * *
When the Tierra del Fuegan relieving force went
aboard the transport, each man found his berth by
the simple process of seeking one bearing the number
of his disc. In the cabin was a trunk containing
some spare teeth, a full-wardrobe of clothing suitable
for tropical wear, directions as to the town he was
to book forward to by rail on arrival at Zanzibar, a
transport coupon, a sheepskin waistcoat for use at
night, and the name and address of the superin-
tendent to whom he would report for service. Each
man knew of course that on arrival he would take up
work to which he had been trained and that the
contingent bad been composed with mathematical
accuracy so as to meet the requirements of civil and
military life at and about the Front. There was an
adequate supply of tailors, architects, butqhers, re-
porters, lawyers, and so on, all dovetailing into the
general plan with absolute accuracy. The Tierra del
Fuegans were not in the habit of leaving things to
chance or putting advts. in the papers for soldiers.
Private 972 (butter maker), writing in July, 2975,
to Punt a Arenas, Straits of Magellan, describes the
position as it was on his arrival at Town 3, plan 6,
subdivision 326: —-
Dear Gran’pa,—Having been inoculated at Zanzi-
bar against contracting cold in the head and been
fumigated, I came on here three days after landing,
having waited for the family. lam 720 miles from the
base. Sam is 200 miles further down, and Uncle
Tom in the next division further up, so I wl.”
Tom pretty often, and Mary and me will be able to
take the youngsters over to spend the day with him
sometimes.
We were allowed a week to settle down, and then
last Monday I took over the butter factory from Joe
Icicle, who has been running the place for seven
years. On Saturday our squad was taken over' to
the Front. We went to the tunnel-opening in a
motor, and after walking a mile reached the first
parapet-chamber. Nothing was to be seen except the
swivel stand-pipes, each with a little roof, dotted
along the hills on both sides. Next week I will com-
mence attending the gas inspectors’ series of lectures,
and after passing* the exam, will have a month a
year attending to two pipes.
The way they manage is to detach a man for a
month and place on him the duty of seeing that the
pipes are kept clean, the lighting apparatus in good
order and the telephone working properly. All the
rest is attended to by the, syndicate. It is easy
going except on the last day of each month, when
the fire is given a trial run from both sides. There
is no night work, because an attack by either
side would immediately bg signalled to Zanzibar by
the burglar alarms and the gas switched on by the
engineer on duty down there. This is a war of
engineers, and very interesting, but there is not much
notice taken of it nowadays, everything being readied
up to keep things quiet.
We are thinking of sending little Billy to the
school of design and Cissy to the millinery academy.
A big budget of news comes from home by wireless
every evening. I suppose I will be here about 10
years or so. The Greenlanders are said to be build-
ing another cathedral and two museums.—Good-bye,
BILLO.
THE WATER-WAGGON.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
From all secret vice, secret drinking and
other gratifications of the natural sneak,
from all backstairs work and from the
demijohn hidden behind the piano, good Lord
deliver us !
It doesn’t affect me much —at present —•
because I am on the water-waggon ; though
I know that the man who is constitution-
ally a teetotaller never does anything worth
while. The constitutional teetotaller is
rarely more than a sub-mediocrity ; he may
quietly endure like a woman, but he does
not greatly do; and the liquor habit, if it
be a disease, is at least not generally a dis-
ease of anaemia. In youth strength pre-
disposes to excess; in maturity and after,
instead of a patient endurance of ill, the
man who has heard the chimes at midnight
accedes to an appreciation of the grim
humor of life, which conquers regret; and
which is not much more than recklessness
grown a trifle weary.
Youth, hoping to learn only by happiness
and finding we learn mostly by pain, gets
the habit of self-control in the ratio of its
unimaginativeness. The imaginative youth
is too amazed with the tremendous miracles
of sunlight and health and the singing in
the blood to have much time for self-
knowledge ; an always-wakeful self-respect
is a dour colonist, and laughter kills him.
And so that there may .pot be a tyranny of
intellect and of life in its divinest expres-
sions, the highest human nature lias the
brake of its pet vice; to every pennyweight
of brilliance a pound of foolishness, so that
councillors, hucksters and other dull fools
may not be quite abolished from the earth.
Cunning beats intellect; the coward deals
a mortal blow to the brave principally that
cowards may not become extinct. The reck-
lessness of speech and deed in the
men so full of life-' as to be drunk
v ith it makes them so intoxicated
with blood and hope as to ask for
wine to add to the unschooled exuber-
ance of youth. To these —the only people
who add to life a new thrill and give to it
a new expression—the lesson of life is
long hidden; and that lesson is to be not
lifted up, to touch wood, to see always the
drawn sword, to take nothing for granted,
and to be ever prepared for change.
“And I did before the sun and moon what-
soever my heart appointed,” says the man
who is a law unto himself; and it is mere
luck that most of what we do is harmless
enough. As equipment to most men there
is youth, sunlight and friends; and where
these three be gathered together shall come
alcohol, the universal solvent, the ever-pre-
sent., so that even the monkish chemists,
looking for the philosopher’s stone, mostly
ended in discovering a new liqueur.
That the ill of its abuse fills the world
with misery for the helpless there can be no
question; and the careless nights of the
bon viveur and the w'ina of the summer can-
not greatly alter the tremendous balance at
debit. In itself it is such a good thing that
it takes mostly the best —the calculating
scoundrel and the mean sneak who works by
schedule must stay sober. Thus the teeto-
tallers, being generally—-at least mentally—
low-grade, see the ill but never 'the good of
it. There was never a genius who was a
teetotaller by birth and desire; maybe there
is a genius temperate because of a weak
stomach or a devotion to work; but all
great ability is at heart extremist; having
the defects of its qualities.
At its best alcohol is the palliation of life
that has only one youth. It meets beauty
and goodness but once, and parts with
them; the rich health of wine flooding the
heartsick with comfort so that man, weary of
lies and treachery, shall not quite turn him-
self away from human kind. Pathologists
may tell us that it is no food, but only a
spur to a tired horse. Men who have en-
dured long under the spur will not allow
the subject to be dismissed so glibly. Some-
where in the Bible is the allegory of the
trees trying to select a king: “And the vine
said unto them: ‘Should I leave my wine
which cheereth God and man, and go to be
promoted over the trees?’ ” And Solomon’s
wisdom knew the value of grog, the com-
forter : “Wine tha t maketh one the heart of
the king and the beggar, so that the mourner
forgetteth his trouble, and the ower his debt.”
It has become part of us; a transmitted
appetite of a many thousand years; and no
law beginning, “Be it enacted,” and full of
“Whereas-es.” shall ever kill a habit that
at the worst only calls for modification.
* * * *
Life has prepared a big brief against it;
the people who should be most protected,
women and children, and the simple and the
young, are overwhelming evidence for the
prosecution. It can demoralise the decent
workman into a brute in half a day; it can
make a sasre look like a satyr in an hour
or two. Plainly most of such effects can
be traced to bad liquor; but the slacking
up of fibre caused by the best of alcoholic
drink is a demoralisation the less only in
degree. The effect on me in youth was to


slack me up in the choice of companions.
People with whom I had not a thought in
common became interesting companions after
t<he third glass. When I contemplate the
sneaking rats of men I knew and thought I
liked, and from my perch on the water-
waggon look down on the memories of them,
I wonder if I were this man or another.
There was one fellow —dull, uneducated,
mean-hearted and sneaking. He had the
cowardly, slanting eye-white of a balky
horse, and a face that spoke of rottenness.
Yet I thought it honest. He could show
me many of the oily littlenesses of his want
of character, and yet I was not disgusted-
because to the foolish expansiveness of youth
was added the glamor of wine. And when
in mean streets you see children without
boots, and squalor in the houses of the
poor because of the devotion of the bread-
winner to liquoi’, these more tangible effects
of demoralisation make some of the lesser
prohibition-fanatics understandable.
But the remedy isn’t prohibition. It is
the insistence of good drink of light alcoholic
strength, seeing that an enjoyable teetotal
drink doesn’t exist. The drinking habits
which we have foolishly transported here
with the gorse and the fox and the rabbit
and sectarianism are to blame. They are
not the habits of the sober Latins, but of
the dull English—the most fat-headed of
men in their cups. The light wine and
beer; the open-air drinking with music; the
rigid supervision of quality—these are the
things which will make the Australian as
temperate as the Italian. Within two
generations. It can’t be done in less time;
and, in such a reform, the more haste the
less speed. The law is powerless ; because
the only power that can dragoon appetite
is the owner thereof. The liquor habit can-
not be removed in toto. But it may be
modified, and the public duty is to aid modi-
fication by making it a pleasanter function
than now.
Meantime, from my perch on the water-
waggon I pray that this wondrous virtue
of mine may not make me a Pharisee. It
did so last time. Years ago, on the way
to Glasgow, I cut out liquor until I should
return to Australia; and then the habit
stayed, so that I was a teetotaller for a
year after my return. I would have been
so until now' but that in Brisbane I became
afraid. In George-street, near Queen-street,
there was a derelict snoring in the gutter
at high noon. He was the original beer
tree: hop-suds were in his whiskers; beer-
bloat caused him to swell through his shock-
ing clothes; his lips were heated purple
from internal fires; the flames of alcohol
made an obscene altar of his nose. Some-
body had performed on him with a fist like
a chisel, and bark was missing from every
curve and corner of his face. His nose was
a i red as a port light, and a pelican might
have budded her nest in his hair. And the
smell of him was as the smell of a three-
penny bar at dawn. To a teetotaller of two
years standing he was an indecent offence.
I looked at him and walked off disgustedly;
not saying as I- should: “There but for the
grace of God lies Henry Worrall,” but:
“Why doesn’t the dog-cart take that fel-
low?” As I entered Lennon’s for lunch, a
friend looked out of the bar and asked me
to join him. I refused, and curtly, and
found myself beginning to think like a
Pharisee, ready to damn that derelict as if
I had been president of the Wowsers’
Union. It made me afraid. I took myself
forcibly back to the bar; and—the evening
and the morning were the first day.
* * * *
But, allowing for no return of the desire
to be a Pharisee, the perch on the water-
waggon is above the dust, and the team is
not weary. When the going is harder and
the team reaches a hill and there are half
a dozen village lads at the foot thereof ask-
ing me to come and play, I will, maybe, get
off the waggon and join the boys. That is,
if I am permitted by this insane desire of
the drunken teetotallers to close up every-
thing and hermetically seal all such places
as sell drinks not made of gas and acid.
In South Australia the referendum has
defeated itself by going to the extremity
of six o’clock; and so will the voice of the
wowser in N. S. Wales if it persists in its
demand for the same thing. For this is truth.
Breaking the law in company with a hundred
or two of other people becomes respectable.
And there is this that is worse. Sly-grog
selling increases in the ratio of the restric-
tions on sale; afid sly-grog is bad grog
nearly always. The restriction on liquor-
selling which knowledge of human nature
calls for is supervision over quality with
gapl for the mean murderer who sells adul-
terated grog._ In France or Italy any man
can get a license to sell liquor with the
ease of buying a license to keep a dog—
and they are the two most sober peoples of
the earth, so sober that a drunken man is
rare enough to make the circus clowns’ imi-
tation of a drunken Englishman a joke of
which the audience never wearies.
The “argument” that drapers have to
close at six woulej have some weight if a
man could drink pyjamas, and the statement
that tomato merchants must stop business
at 10 p.m. leaves out the very human fact
that an Australian rarely asks a friend to
have another tomato.
That section of the community which
would demand civil war if it were com-
pelled to drink beer is not by any means
the best section of the people. Its con-
tribution to the war has been shrieks de-
manding that the other fellow should go
and do. the fighting; reprobations of the
Australian and praises for the dear old
motherland which, with the dogs of Ger-
many. at her throat, won’t swallow the pill
of universal compulsory service, yet demands
the closing of Parliament, urges the calling
of J. Cook into the Government (after a
million or two of Australians had shouted
that it wouldn’t have the Quilp of Parra-
matta at any price) ; shrieks for the aban-
donment of football grounds, which help
greatly to the training, of a soldier: screams
for the closing of theatres, and for the aboli-
tion of the Sunday banana truck.
Still a man may be happy on bhe water-
waggon. yet think little of the mentality of
some who are his fellow-passengers and be
angry with the person who tells him he must
never walk again.
RANDOLPH BEDEORD.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Recruiting of Pound Notes.
There is not much time left to fill in appli-
cation forms for the new Commonwealth
loan- —the most attractive investment of the
gilt-edged sort offered in Australia fqr very
many years. The security is all that any
country can give. Behind it stands the whole
taxable wealth of Australia. In fact, seeing
that the money is being raised for war pur-
poses, it can be safely said that behind it is
the taxable wealth of the whole Empire. As
for interest return, such concessions are
offered on top of the nominal p.c. interest
that the investment will be worth approxi-
mately 5 per cent, all through ; apd, as a very
heavy income tax is almost certain for a good
many years, and since income taxes, both
State and Commonwealth, will not be levied
on income derived from this loan, the chances
are that for some time to come the return
will be worth well over 5 p.c. So much from
the money-grubbing point of view. There is
another aspect, of course —the patriotic. This
is tremendously important for two reasons.
There is an outcry that the young men are
not coming forward as recruits. As a matter
of fact they have not been coming forward
badly, since 12 per cent, of (he men of fight-
ing age have already enlisted and probably
another 2 or 3 per cent, are waiting to get
the harvest in, when they will follow. At the
same time thousands certainly are shirking
behind any old-excuse; and the absence of
sacrifice on the part of the older and richer
is the commonest excuse of all. If this loan
is not well subscribed a trench will be digged
for every young shirker in the country.
Every one who will not go if he can find
any sort of plausible excuse for holding back
will be provided with that excuse. This is
the Fatman’s recruiting. How will he
come up to the scratch on August
31? If he doesn’t come up well,
there is going to be a woeful slump
in recruiting of the other brand. If
he does, the recruiter will be armed with a
gun to blow the bottom out of the common-
est excuse heard hitherto. And then there is
the moral effect of every successful loan.
This is a war of exhaustion, and both sides
know it. The news of the success of an
Australian loan might not be headlined in
the papers of Berlin. The news of the fail-
ure of a loan certainly would be. If must
not fail. It must be a great success. And
the greater the success the sooner the war is
likely to end, and the lighter the burden or
taxation we shall have to carry.

Scaddan Blows Cold on Red-hot
Necessity.
Premier Scaddan’s sense of responsibility
in the matter of providing Australian forces
for the war is a remarkably blunted sense.
Said Happy John, talking to the commercial
travellers of Perth on a whisky-and-cigar
occasion:—
The people of Westralia have done their part as far
as enlistment is concerned, and it would be absurd
to initiate a recruiting campaign until it can be
shown that the State has not done its part in finding
men for the Front. At this moment there are more
men at Blackboy Hill than can be properly equipped
and cared for. When sending men to camp we
should first make certain that they will not have to
sleep in six inches of water, which, I understand,
has sometimes been the case.
Scaddan doth profess to concern himself too
much about the Federal Government’s busi-
ness, which is the care and equipment) of re-
cruits. Premier Peacock in Victoria didn t
stop to inquire whether the Federal Govern-
ment would do its duty before he proceeded
to do his own and give the other States a
lead in recruiting booms. Nor will any
other patriot. As for equipment, the de-
mand from Britain is for as many troops as
can be sent, “equipped or otherwise”; so
that in dragging in the lack of equipment
Scaddan merely provides the shirker with a
rotten excuse for loafing on better men. The
first duty of a State Premier is to encourage
recruits to come forward and be sworn in ;
his second duty is to encourage more recruits
to come forward and be sworn in. If the
lack of suitable camping space is then worry-
ing him, he has a third duty—to rush in
with offers of his local Government’s assist-
ance to the great Cause. To merely talk of
six-inch puddles of water and leave it at
that would be excellent policy if the Pre-
mier were one Von Scaddan who desired
to live up to his name. But sueh a Von
Scaddan wouldn’t be properly at the Pre-
mier’s office, lie would be more suitably
housed at a German concentration camp.
And what would not be tolerable if it were
said by Von Scaddan cannot be quietly
endured when it is said by John Scaddan.
The Law and the Pint Pot.
Two miles of petition urging that the pubs
in N. S. Wales shall be closed at 6 p.m.
having been rolled into the State Assembly,
the weary old controversy about beer and
drunkenness and morality and the moderate
drinker and all the rest of it) has bursty forth
once more. Bung has rushed up a wnggon-
loq,d of counter-petition, and about 50 poli-
ticians are frantically explaining their posi-
tion in the matter and struggling to find out
which way the cat is going to jump. There-
fore during the next week or two one of the
main subjects of whispered conversation
among the “statesmen” of N. S. Wales will
be how they can so handle this business as
to escape burning tfieir fingers. The ques-
tion of the hours at which the selling of beer
should begin and end is one of the innum-
erable problems that cannot be decided by
logic. The only guiding principle is the
public convenience and the general welfare.
The sale of steak stops at a certain hour, of
pills at a different hour, and of jam-tarts
still later. The hours are arrived at by
rough rule-of-thumb, the test of justification
not being that they are logical (because at
this point they are wildly absurd), but that
they fall into a. general scheme of regulation
without causing a serious upset. There is
nothing morally wrong in disposing of steak
at 10 p.m., and there is nothing morally worse
about “filling ’em up” at midnight than in
doing it at mid-day. And it happens, owing
to the exceptional character of the goods on
sale, that almost every argument which justi-
fies the cutting off of the supply of beer at
a certain moment can be used in favor of
turning off the tap at another. Broadly
speaking, the issue now is whether sobriety
would be encouraged by closing the hotel at
the same hour as the drapery emporium. It
is quite conceivable that it would reduce
the quantity of visible drunkenness. It is
certain that one result would be to change
the venue and make drinking common in
places where it is now uncommon. If all
the pubs were shut to-morrow a certain
measure of good would be achieved in one
direction —and a plentiful crop of worse
evils than those got rid of would be created
by the changed conditions. But a.s the ques-
tion on hand is wholly one of sobriety, why
not enforce the existing law at once —-to-day
- —instead of wasting time in futile, dis-
honest controversy about the clock? The
N. S. Wales Licensing Act provides stringent
penalties for serving intoxicated persons.
If these were enforced the early-closing
petitioners would not have a leg to stand
on, except the precarious one that people
have no right to go into hotels at all. And
why is the law not put into operation? Why
is it that in any street at any hour the
numerous drunk offends the nose and eye—
that in Sydney there are many hotels whose
mere existence represents a scandalous mal-
administration of law? It seems to this
paper that these are vital inquiries for Par-
liament to answer, instead of coquetting with
crude devices to cloak conditions arising
directly from rotten administration of a law
which, if honestly enforced, would achieve
its purpose. As things are now the com-
bination of unscrupulous traders, Ministerial
timidity and political dishonesty have created
a position in which the only alternative
offered is between countenancing this out-
rageous trinity and recklessly penalising
people who conduct their businesses and
themselves decently. The Bulletin holds
no admiration for booze in excess, nor has
it much enthusiasm for gassy waters. But
it feels called upon to remark that
the early closing of some drinkcries
is not nearly so important as their extinc-
tion, and that the shutting up of others
when the sun goes down would be tyranni-
cal, because unnecessary. The crux of the
whole matter is the : administration of the
law, and some of the unpicturesque indivi-
duals who are in charge of the gun ought to
be made explain the alarming dampness of
the ammunition. The really amazing thing
is why Bung does not get busy himself, for
it must surely be obvious to him that, unless
he does, somebody is going to get badly hurt
before the war is over.
When Holman and his Ministers can
snatch time from telling the other fellow
to go to the Front is a small health
matter calling for their attention. That is
an amendment of the Lunaey Act to pro-
vide for the admission of voluntary patients
to the hospitals for the insane. Numbers
of people, aware that their mental condition
is becoming unsound, seek to be taken in as
ordinary patients; lut as their malady is
not far enough advanced to justify certifica-
tion, they cannot be accepted. The unfor-
tunates are, therefore, compelled to remain
without expert attention until they become
well-developed lunatics. Frequently cases
that, if properly treated in the early stages,
would be curable, pass by this Bedlam-
hatched law to' the incurable. The needed
amendment, as well as one to allow patients
to be treated without compelling their resi-
dence in a mental hospital, have been
vainly urged for years by the Inspector-
General of the Insane in N. S. Wales. But
the hunt for somethipg else to put up the
spout with Uncle Lombardy has been so
constant that such trifles as the reduction
of the lunacy rates have had to stand aside.
Justice Rich’s report on the Liverpool
(N.S.W.) camp is, when all is sa'd and
done, a more scathing indictment of the
stupid Censorship than of anything else.
The scandals would have been barely possi-
ble had the press not been muzzled; cer-
tainly it is incredible that they would all
have been possible. In plain words, these
are the facts of the Censorship so far as it
is possible to tell them. The newspapers
engage men who have undergone a lifelong
training, and who, to begin with, have some
natural gifts for the job. Nine-tenths of
them are trained, among other things, to
The Little Homes.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We have heard the cheering, brothers,
We have heard the martial peal;
We have seen the soldiers marching
And the glint of sun and steel.
We have heard the songs, the shouting;
But, while forth the soldier roams,
Who has heard the weeping, brothers,
In the Little Homes?
We have seen the gay processions
And the careless, laughing erbwds;
We have seen the banners' waving
Out against the peaceful clouds;
Yet, while colors proudly flutter
Over noble spires and domes,
Who has seen the mourning, brothers,
In the Little Homes?
From the Little Homes that nestle
Where the smiling fields sweep wide,
From the Little Homes that huddle
In the city, side by side,
They have called the eager fighters—
Men who went with smiles and cheers ;
Pride of wives and pride of mothers,
Choking back the tears !
Women of the little homesteads,
Women gf the city slums,
They are waiting, ever waiting;
And the sound of muffled drums
In some stricken Home is echoed,
Where grey Grief is guest to-day.
And to-morrow? Nay, the others
Still must wait—and pray.
What the Little Homes shall suffer,
What the Little Homes shall pay
Must be more than sturdy fighters,
More than women’s grief to-day.
In the years that follow after,
Be our battles won or lost,
In the Little Homes, my brothers,
They shall pay the cost.
They shall pay the cost of glory,
They shall pay the price of peace,
Years and many long years after
All the sounds of battle cease.
When the sword is sheathed —or broken —
When the battle flag is furled,
Still the Little Homes must suffer
Over all the World.
Have you seen the old grey mothers
Smiling to the ringing cheers?
Have you seen the young wives striving
Bravely to hold back the tears?
Have you seen the young girl marching
By her soldier-lover’s side?
Have you seen our country’s women
All aglow with pride?
Then, shall we think shame, my brothers,
To give thanks upon our knees
That the land we love should hold them —
Wives and mothers such as these?
Women who still hide their sorrow
As their soldiers march away,
Turning brave and steadfast faces
To the light of day?
Oh, the Little Homes are cheerful —■
Little Homes that know no pride
But the pride of sacrificing
Loved ones to the battle tide!
They are many, many, brothers,
And their sacrifice is great.
Shrines are they and sacred places,
Where the women wait.
Aye, the Little Homes are holy
At the closing of the day,
When young wives must face their sorrow,
When grey mothers kneel to pray,
Facing, all alone, dread visions
Of the land the soldier roams.
Then God heed the sobbing, brothers,
In the Little Homes.
VICTORIA.

The Fatal Habit of Pulling Your Own
Leg.
The War Expert of the period prattles
about the Great Calamity:—
ENEMY LANDS IN NEW SOUTH WALES.
A Barren Triumph.
Tuesday. —At 7.15 a.m. on Monday the enemy’s
transports anchored in Broken Bay and an hour later
troops were landed, amid a rain of rifle fire and
shrapnel from our gallant defenders, at Soldiers’
Point, some three miles north of Newport. Our
men abandoned the Point for strategic reasons—
it being useless to the main objective, namely the
defence of Sydney—and fell back towards the
ocean.
INVADERS FIRMLY HELD.
Wednesday. —Fighting continued during the whole
of yesterday between Newport and Narrabeen. The
invader was repulsed with terrific slaughter in the
French’s Forest sector, though towards night-fail he
was suffered to occupy some trenches abandoned by
us with the object of straightening out our line.
The enemy continues to be firmly held everywhere.
NARRABEEN FALLS.
The Enemy Disappointed.
Thursday. —At 2 p.m. on Wednesday the invaders
stormed across the lake and invested Narrabeen.
They found but the empty husk of a town. There
was no beer at the public house; the papers of the
Progress Association had been removed; there was
not a tin of petrol or biscuits or sardines at the
post office. The foe is steadily losing morale and
there is an idea in well-informed circles that the
end is not far off.
ANOTHER TRIUMPH FOR OUR ARMS.
Appalling Slaughter at Brookvale.
Friday. —Furious at his repeated failures the
enemy rushed Brookvale, yesterday, in overwhelm-
ing force. Regiment after regiment pressed forward
in close formation, only to be mercilessly mowed
down like corn before the scythe. It was not war;
it was wholesale slaughter. Flushed with victory
we took up a strong position on the Manly-Fresh-
water line, dynamiting all soft-drink establishments,
refreshment rooms and Chinese gardens behind us as
we went.
ENEMY ENTERS MANLY.
Despair of the Ceneral.
Saturday.— At 10.15 a.m. on Friday the invaders
entered Manly unopposed. Their gain was a hollow
one. The contents of the shops, stores and hotels
had' all been removed. During the whole of the
preceding nig’ht the residents worked heroically,
dynamiting the wharves, surfing-sheds, picture-
shows and tram-sheds. The cab and other horses,
the motor : cars and all vehicles had been despatched
to Sydney by boat. The General, on taking up his
quarters at the leading hotel, said with a despairing
oath to one of his staff: “They have left us the
shadow,” He then commandeered some tinned
salmon from a neighboring boarding-house for his
tea—paying in bons which are believed locally to
be valueless—and on attempting to get some water
from a tap discovered that the municipality had
cut the fluid off. The old adage that it is unlucky
to invest a town on a Fnday is being recalled, and
gloom has settled upon the enemy.
THE DASH ON SYDNEY.
[Editorial in Sunday “Extraordinary”.]
The wild venture of battering a path to Sydney is
being persisted in by the enemy in the face of
unthinkable carnage. Despite continuous reverses of
a stupendous character their advance guards had by
lunch-time yesterday been flogged on by their
officers as far as The Spit at Middle Harbor. With
the exception of the advance guards and a com-
pany or so of engineers who are building a bridge—
the punts having been dismantled and sunk at the
first approach of danger—our enemies have been
repulsed in a decisive manner everywhere. Entirely
misconceiving the position, a few citizens have re-
newed the cry for the system of conscription. There
is no need whatever for any measure so un-English,
and so drastic. What though Sydney itself should
fall? We do not hint that it will. B.ut suppose for
the sake of argument it did. Has it any strategic
value? Does it benefit Us from the military stand-
point to hold it? Would the possession of it not
bo rather a handicap than otherwise to the enemy?
And is it not a demonstrable fact that our troops
could give a better account of themselves on the
wide, free plains between Parramatta and Penrith
—with the Blue Mountains to fall back upon in
ease of need—than in any city? These are the
questions with which the conscriptionist needs to
be faced. There is plenty of time in the future to
take, if necessary, to the system which has enslaved
our antagonists. It is certainly no moment for it
now, when, by universal consent, we are winning all
along the line.

“CALIFORNIA SYRUP OF FIGS.”
Harmless “fruit” laxative cleanses
stomach, liver and bowels without
griping or discomfort.
An acjd stomach, clogged with fermenting,
ill-digested food, means that the liver is not
doing its duty. Nature provided ripe fruit
juices to keep the liver up to its work.
“California Syrup of Figs” is a deliciously
refreshing fruit laxative which is always in
season. You can keep it at hand, and it
will be an unfailing friend whenever the
tongue is coated, bowels sluggish, breath
foul, throat dry or sore, stomach full of
wind, and head hot and aching. You can
take a dose whenever it is needed, as safely
as you could eat fresh fruit. In a short
while you will feel the benefit. The bowels
will be gently relieved, and the stomach
cleansed and sweetened qs the undigested
food is moved on and got rid of. The tongue
will grow clean again and the head will be
cooled and cleared. Therfe is no mistaking
the beneficial effects of '“California Syrup
of Figs.” Directions are with it for adults
and children of all ages. This pleasant
laxative is good for all, and cannot possibly
harm even the most delicate, but you must
ask for “California Syrup of Figs,” and look
for the name and trade mark of the Cali-
fornia Fig Syrup Co. All leading chemists
sell “California Syrup of Figs.” 1/11 and
1/9 per bottle.

A Left Hook to the Enemy in Two
Places.
Encouraged by the success of his navy
among fishing smacks and passenger steam-
ers. the gallant von Tikpitz last week em-
barked upon the desperate undertaking of
sending a fleet against something that could
hit back. No doubt it looked like a pretty
easy job to deal with the Russians in the
Gulf of Riga ; but, as things turned out, the
Hun’s share of the proceedings consisted of
a hard knock on the nose and the abandon-
ment of the best part of himself at the bot-
tom of the sea. The remainder apparently
dashed back to the Kiel Canal and screwed
another padlock on the gate. According to
the accounts available for public consump-
tion, the Bear grabbed the army that was
being transported to wound him in the
rear, and sank several cruisers and torpedo
boats ; while a submarine, stated to be British,
sent the von Moltke, a supei'-Dreadnought,
to join the Blucher and Gneisenau. Clearly
the sea is no place for. the German to trust
himself, and if the multitudinous rats that
are hiding round Heligoland could only be
dug out and flung into the open for a few
hours the Kaiser’s paysheet would be reduced
in short order. They had a substantial vic-
tory, however, with torpedoes over a couple
of America-bound passenger ships during the
week, and goaded Uncle Sam to a state of
fury. How much longer Sam is goi,ng to
remain on speaking terms with the skulking
brutes who prowl about handing out suuden
death to United States citizens has now
become a matter of merely languid interest
to the rest of the world. After all, if the
Yank takes it lying down—well, it is his
business! But he must be feeling about the
cheapest thing on earth just now. Of the
campaign by land good news has stuck its
head up at last. A successful movement
appears to have been made at Gallipoli,
where, after a, desperate fight, the Turk has
been pinned down to a new front, and in
such a position as to make him a mighty
anxious Mussulman. The losses in this
operation from Suvla Bay were heavy, and
Australia this week saw its longest casualty
list since the war began ; which is a remin-
der that 10,000 young men who have handed
in their names recently for enrolment have
forgotten to call round again. It looks as
if somebody could be usefully employed in
jogging their memories or warming their
feet. Big things may be happening directly ;
and the more men there are on hand then
the swifter will be the end and the fewer
Australians will be buried in a foreign
grave. On the Eastern front the situation
is still confused, with Ivan steadily falling
back, the German plugging on, and Petro-
grad vehemently denying any intention of
negotiating a separate peace. Whatever
may be going forward behind the curtain
there can be little doubt that the Russian
will feel more cheerful when he sees the
band of his friends definitely closing on the
Turk’s throat.
W. J. Russell, killed by accident at Pyr-
mont (Sydney) last week, was a Labor
stalwart who made great efforts to plant
his party’s standard in an anti-sosh strong-
hold. He tackled Spruce Myth in the Parkes
Federal division in 1918 and 1914, and each
time got closer to the flying Lib.’s coat-tail.
Russell was a good, hard, clean fighter, a
Big Australian, and only on the 36th mile-
stone when the crash came.
The three seats vacant in the Leg. Coun-
cil of South Aus. have, by give-and-take,
been filled without contest. They were all
pretty “safe” seats, anyway, so each side
could be generous with an easy conscience.
The chief result is to increase outside-the-
city representation. Instead of Klauer, an
Adelaide hotelkeeper, Labor sends Harvey,
a Moonta Mines man all his 46 years of
life, secretary of the Miners’ Association,
.and one of the best known men in the dis-
trict. He had previously had two unsuccess-
ful shots at the Federal House of Reps. The
other two new men are Liberals. The
northern miller Addison has been replaced
by Axorrow, ex-Mayor of Port Pirie, and the
Adelaide lawyer John Downer by Botterill,
a pastoralist from the south-eastern district.
Both Botterill and Morrow are Victorian by
birth, but South Ars. by long residence.

“STOP YOUR NONSENSE,” AT SYD-
NEY ROYAL.
Poverty Pointer (Fred Twitchin) and
David Burlesko (Henry Ford).
“Our Miss Gibbs” wears well. The short
revival-meeting which finishes this (Thurs-
day) evening at Her Majesty’s, Sydney,
proves that the musical old shoplady is still
full of hope and glory. The present version
has a number of new principals ; so a lot of
people who retained memories of gentle
Blanche Browne as Mary Gibbs hurried
along to make odious comparisons with
Thelma Raye, and found the newcomer all
ready and confident in a red wig. She has
a sweet voice, enough fascination to go on
with, and dances nicely. Derek Hudson,
who. loves Mary tunefully, in the proper
musical-comedy manner, is handicapped by
everyday clothes and a straw boater hat. His
type of good looks needs the barbaric cos-
tume he trailed and flung in “Gipsy Love.”
Leslie Holland, one of the survivors of the
original co., does as well as ever with the
idiotic part of the Honorable Hughie, and
carols the ancient “Yip-I-Addy” as though
it were still a live idiocy. Phil Smith is
consistently amusing as Timothy Gibbs;
Ethel Cadman is a decorative Lady Eliza-
beth Thanet; and Addie Lennard makes a
brisk and natural Madame Jeanne. The
aristocratic pathos of old friend Ban-
toek, as the white-haired Earl of St. Ives,
who quavers constantly “My boy!” is
delicious comedy. The show runs brightly
to Andrew MacCunn’s orchestra, and the
dressing is noticeably smart. “The Girl in
the Taxi” arrives on Saturday.
Business as usual at the Palace (Sydney),
where “The Royal Strollers” have ceased
from travelling and the weary get the best.
* * $
“Potash and Perlmutter” open their line
of exclusive Yiddish goods at the Criterion
(Sydney) on Saturday evening. The adver-
tisements speak very well of the firm.
“Stop Your Nonsense,” Beaumont
Smith’s mysterious success, continues to rage
prosperously at Sydney Roval. It is the
sort of happy show into which new things
can be fed at intervals, and no cheerful
playgoer can afford to leave it unwatched
for more than a week at a time.
Clemons and Dean, who have returned to
Sydney Tivoli after many days, bring with
them their old bright turn, and, as before,
the brightest spot is the Drunk dance.

Marlowdrama is “off” at Melbourne
Princess’s for an indefinite period, and
“Babes in the Wood” is “on.” Considered
as a huge hunk of crude frivolity at popular
prices, which begins early and ends late,
“Babes” gets criticism fairly down. The
hunk is so bulky that large bits of it might
bo chipped off and still leave value for the
money. There are lots of young legs, and
many gags that are old as the eternal veri-
ties, and up and down and round about the
medley runs the shapely figure of Carrie
Moore, who has lately renewed her early
sprightliness. Worse things than “Babes
in the Wood” have happened to the present
historian. Given a large, sharp knife, he
wouldn’t plunge it into the extravaganza’s
heart for Kultur’s sake* but would remove a
number of the excrescences, and cut out the
concealed citizen who plays the Goat. This
frequent intruder is about the saddest ani-
mal-impersonator under the broad canopy of
Heaven.

Carlton Chase, a matter-of-fact American
gent, who is dressed in tights and a tunic,
like a Stroller, but is supposed to be a con-
ventional comic baron of panto., remarks
from time to time that he hopes to repair
his damaged fortunes by marrying the Dame.
Although all sorts of absurdities have been
attached to the leading she-male in panto,
this is the first time a serious-minded Baron
has announced in a grave, commercial-
traveller manner that all will be well if he
can secure the Dame’s hand in wedlock. The
notion of Robin Hood setting the Royal bar-
don by rescuing the Babes from the Wood
is also a droll novelty, but it doesn’t equal
the Baron’s love-suit for real humor. The
two kiddies in the name parts are bright
little mummers, and their scene with Maid
Marion (Ray De Vere) is one of the happi-
est items of the show. The amateurish
young lady aforesaid is a dainty novice,
whose sweet voice is particularly effective
in-a duet with Carrie Moore. Dan Thomas
is an active, hard-working knockabout
Dame ; the Yiddish comedy of Bert Le Blanc
is frequently funny : and the patchwork sec-
ond act, which is practically all vaudeville
and revue and no panto, (after the opening
scene), introduces a catchy song by Gran-
ville Jones. Scenery and dressing of a

Both of the J. C. Williamson theatres in
Melbourne are changing the bill on Satur-

Royal, makes way for Muriel Starr and the
co. from Her Majesty’s. The transplanted
co. will appear in “Under Cover.” At Her
Majesty’s the Comic Opera Co. starts a
repertoire season of 12 weeks with “After
the Girl.” The pursued female is new to
Melbourne, and a run of two consecutive
weeks has been arranged for her.

“The Squatter’s Daughter” is back again
at Melbourne King’s, where the old reliable
bushrangers are keeping popular interest on
the boil. Miss Spriggins continues to
lament the blight of bush life on an exotic
English nature, while the trained Binghis are
still providing circus turns whenever the
bustling narrative falls down from fatigue.
Likewise the voracious ants of Bert Bailey’s
fancy maintain their awful appetites, accord-
ing to schedule, and the famous dawn, which
breaks in on the meditation of the pinioned
hero in Eucalypti Gorge, remains the same
achievement in amber and rose. Guy Has-
tings brings a big fist into play as the heroic
Tom Bathurst, and swaps hot words with a
new Dudley Harrington, endowed by E.
Bellairs with a full hand of sneers. Dudley
is the “mistake” in the life of Sarah Lynch
(Miss Lilias Adeson), who recounts her
betrayal in loud, undressed language moist-
ened with beer. Sarah -mentions that she
was a simple little bush flower once, but,
through Dudley and DeTrink, she became
something coarse and lurid like a beetroot.
Miss Lesley Adrienne is a not unwelcome
stranger as Violet Enderby, but she needs
more body and soul for the part. Moreover,
her voice never contains the canoodling note
of a love-lorn worshipper of bush manhood.
Miss Laura Roberts is an engaging picture
as Jenny Thornton. Miss Alfreda Bevan has
to bear the slings and arrows of outrageous
bullants as Virginia Spriggins; E. McDonald
and Arthur Bertram are niggers wreaking
their dreadful hunger on all the tucker pro-
curable ; and Jack Lennon (Ben Hall) hides
his acting behind a beard that flaps like a
sail. Bert Bailey himself is mellowing into
middle age in the character of Archie
McPherson, while Ned Duggan, as the parent
of Dudley Harrington, is a man of more
stummick and less discourse.

The Belgian Band, just now appearing at
Melbourne Auditorium, travels under the
disadvantage of a misleading title. It sug-
gests a foreign relation to Sousa and the
Besses, whereas it is rather a Belgian Or-
chestra, assisted by a piano and two
vocalists, of whom Goossens, the oaritone,
is a notably impressive artist. The “Band”
—2O strong—has a somewhat Sousa-like
conductor, confronting the audience instead
of facing the musicians. Three of these have
thus far emphasised their talent in solo per-
formances. Arthur Baroen gets a beauti-
fully distinctive tone from his ’cello ; Florent
Hoogstoel is a skilled performer, but not
a tender sentimentalist, on the violin ; and
Henri Penn, the pianist, plays a solo as
admirably as he treats an accompaniment.
The Band, in its orchestral entirety, does
hardly anything that it can’t do uncommonly
well. It is at its best, perhaps, in the
“Madame Butterfly” fantasia, the “Ab-
dullah” march, composed by conductor Meny,
and a thing by Lacombe. But in a reper-
toire which is changed eight times a week
the best wants a lot of finding.

stone-broke remnants of two royal houses
pursue a mournful existence, brightened by

“Cinderella” had a brief but crowded week
at Adelaide Royal. It is a good show, but
leaves no special impression. Dolly Castles
is a charming heroine, and Lupino ran a
good, old-fashioned harlequinade at the chil-
dren’s afternoon performance. The sudden
illness of Minnie Love gave Dorothy Firmin
a. quick promotion from spiteful sister to
principal boy. The Royal is empty for the

cessful season with a Bret Harte adaptation.

“The Cracked Tenor”: In the
scramble for boats when the Arabic
was torpedoed, Stella Carol, I see,
cheered up the other passengers by
singing gaily. This is the young girl
whom Amy Sherwin, well loved in
Australia, has trained for a concert
career. By chance, Amy heard her
singing in the streets of Hampstead
one Christmas : Eve—a 14-year-old
waif, 'seeking to ‘ earn a few pence for
a poverty-stricken home. Adopting
her. the Australian singer trained her,
and brought her out at a concert in
London a year or so later, when her
voice; a high soprano ranging to F
in alt, won great praise. She was on
her way to sing in U.S.A. when the
Gerhogs nearly sent her to the bot-
tom of the ocean. Stella Carol is
merely a stage name, chosen because
when she was’ discovered she was
singing Christmas kitties under the
stars.

“Harrison O.”: Why should “Stargazer”'
worry (B. 19./8/T5) because “Shaw has not

complain because the dialogue of the opera is
not as brilliant as that of “Arms and the
Man”? “The Chocolate Soldier” is not an
adaptation of “Arms and the Man,” but a
deliberate “unauthorised parody,” and it is
always announced as such, “with apologies to
Bernard Shaw.” The “Stargazer” attitude is
as unreasonable as would be that of a critic
who cherished a grievance because a parody
of “Paradise Lost” lacked the poetic gran-
deur and the mighty-mouthed harmonies of

The new ditty—in reality a fairly old one —
is concerned with a certain Mr. Riley, who
“keeps an hotel” and is “doing quite well” —
which is a pretty safe thing to say about any
man whom a pub keeps. Although it is sup-
posed to hail from the U.S.A. the song was
written 30 years ago by two brothers named
Barrett, of Manchester. The younger,
who was responsible for the “catchy” melody,
was at the time organist of the leading R.C.
church in Cottonopolis, and blossomed forth
a few years afterwards as “Leslie Stuart,”
the composer of “Floradora.”
“Yarra Ben” : I am with “Vic.” when he
says (B. 12/8/T5) that, in the matter of
plays, “the public only wants amusement” —
more especially in these fifing times of war.
And I am one of those who think that the
American concoctions supply the want. Per-
sonally I am quite as much amused with
“The Law of the Land” as with “Potash and
Perlmutter.” Also “Vic” is right when he
asserts that the public “never notices whether
a play is convincing or otherwise.” I know
a play that was quite convincing, but even
on the opening night the public never noticed
that fact about it. On subsequent evenings
it noticed it less and less. The proprietor
spent a fortune in advertising, but the public
never noticed that either. In fact, the
only genuine notice the show attracted was
the notice to quit which all concerned got
after a three weeks’ run! It was quite an
amusing play, too. I laughed at it every
night. I wrote it.

Are off to cold seclusion packed

' Upon the stage before your eyes
In crimson suit adorned with gold
In many acts of fierce emprise.
Alas ! I find the ladies fair
Are bored by such a show to-day.
For simulation they don’t care,
Though genius is brought to bear—
They want the re-al thing, they saj'.
“No art it needs, no subtle tact
To get cut up on field or seas;
But, sir, a hero fine to act
. Doth call fpr splendid qualities.
Yet look about where’er you be,
And soldiers’ portraits by the score
In window, case, or journal see,
And not one picture now of me!
By gad, it is a brutal war!”

Beach and assistants commandeered all mir-

success has been brought under the eye of
the military panjandrums. The idea, of
course, is not new. Years ago it was demon-
strated at Bisley (Eng.) ; but military

troops would ever get close enough to make
the thing of any value. The belief that
modern artillery was formidable enough to
slay' everything within five to 10 miles was
too strongly entrenched. The cognoscenti
having been proved hopelessly wrong, an
idea, similar to the one" used by Beach and
his mates, is now being worked oh by the-

“Boswell”: An original pair of jokers
occupied Judge Rootli’s attention in Perth
Criminal Court the other day. Hummerston
was a law clerk and ex-policeman; Jeffery, a
magsman for a tailoring firm. An old man
died leaving a suburban block of real estate.
HummeiSLpn discovered that, as the deceased
had boarded with his (Hummerston’s)
mother, he naturally owed Hummerston IST
for arrears. Therefore he drew up a sum-
mons, and accompanied the bailiff until Jeff-
ery came along. “That’s ’im,” remarked
Hummerston, and Jeffery was duly blistered.
In due course Hummerston went to the court
and secured judgment, the contumacious
deceased not materialising in defence, though,
of course, the bailiff swore the summons had
been served all right. Eventually the block
of land was sold in satisfaction of the debt
—-buyer, Hummerston, £25. Of this, £23 odd
was refunded to Hummerston on account of
the judgment, and he duly mortgaged for
£2O the land thus acquired. Later on Jeffery
and his cobber quarrelled over finance, and
Jeffery put (he police up to the joke. He
thus assured' Humnrerston’s arrest and his
own as well.; As all intestate lands in W.A.
are vested in the Chief Justice, the two were
charged with conspiring to defraud ’Sonah
McMillan. During the proceedings a mouse’s
head in a meat pie, for which a Perth
caterer had paid £lOO for sh-sli, traced its
course back to the two accused, and other
things as well. The result of the mix-up was
that the Bench remarked “two years each.”
One,or two officials are now leisurely looking
up the law about the disposal of intestate
estates and the mortgaging of dead men's
land.

Clifton Springs Hotel, near Geelong, now
being used by the Defence Department for
its Victorian convalescents, is in a green
and sequestered spot on the shore of Corio
Bay—no township; only beach, bush and a
private bar. There are several springs; all
different, according to the natives —chaly-
beate, dry ginger-ale, iron-and-quinine, and
so forth—but the flavor varies very little.
A pious and popular R.C. publican named

After this war the Englishman will know
a few more things about his blawsted
kawlonies. General Godley sends a story
on this point from the Turkish front. When
it was known that the Maori contingent was
moving up to the fighting line the General
received a hurried message asking the
strength of the contingent and if it required
special tucker. Knowing, as he explains,
that it is quite a common belief that the
Maoris are cannibals, Godley officially re-
plied that he “hoped there would be. suffi-
cient Turks taken prisoner or killed to go
round!”
A sensible Anglican parson made an at-
tempt, at this year’s meeting of the “House
of Mercy” maternity home at Walkerville
(S.A.), to rescind the Board’s standing re-
fusal to allow the maternity bonus to be
claimed in respect of births in the Home,
on the ground that it “places a premium
on immorality.” The bonus is not a prize,
the sensible parson said —it is an. assur-
ance that at a critical time mothers Can get
nourishment and care. The Home is giving
them just that; and then it declines the fair
recompense ! But the Bishop coldly squashed
common sense. This was “hardly the time,”
he said, to re-open the question. In other
words, the Bishop and his flock having
accused a great political party of paying a
premium on immorality, the accusation must
remain, just or unjust, until the war is
over! One can only suspect that the real
trouble is that the Labor party was respon-
sible for the bonus. _ These Labor fellows —
what does it matter if they do rest for years
under an undeserved stigma of paying a
premium on immorality!
“Eye Witness” at the Battle of Albert
Park:—
A company of recruits under a courageous young
officer inexperienced in actual ' warfare had a des-
perate and wholly unexpected' encounter with the
enemy in Albert Park (Melb.) the other day. The
squad was drilling energetically in the cold and
damp of an unpleasant morning, when suddenly the
foe darted out of ambush and charged with a
horrifying slogan and a lethal parasol. The gamp
took a purple private in the midriff, bayonet-wise,
and the private heaved a sigh, and turned it up.
He went over and lay writhing, till the insolent
enemy seized him by one ear and endeavored to re-
tire with her prisoner.in tow.
The German frightfulness of this drew a protest
from the commanding officer.
“Yah-h, fry yer ffee!” said the enemy.
“But my good woman,” said the lieutenant, “you
cannot get away with the soldiers of the King in
this manner !”
“Soljers iv the King, me ’at!” said the enemy.
“ ’E’b me ’usband, tha’s what he is, ’n’ ’ome he’s
goin’, see.”
She attempted to drag her prey through the mud
by. his elongated left ear, and Private Blank put up
a pitiful cry.
“i don’t care if,he is your husband, madam,” said
the lieutenant. “You must not interfere. Stand'
back!”
The enemy became terrible.
“An’ ,’oo ’re you,” she said, “t’ part an ’usband
from his wife?” and. prodded a button of-his tunic.
Then she returned to her original victim. “Ged-
dup ’n’ come ’ome,” she said. “Yeh lazy ’ound, come
’ome !”
“Won’t,” said the husband. “I’m goin’ t' the war.
It’s somethin’ if a man can’t have no pleasure of
his life. I’m goin’ t’ the war.”
“What!” squealed the enemy. “I’ll show you all
about goin’ t’ the war.”
She charged again.
“Two .men. fall out!” yelled the officer. “Seize
that woman!”
Two men fell out and tried to seize her. They did
no succeed too well.
“Two more fall out, and help to hold her!” cried
the lieutenant. “Six men hold her !. . . .Eight men !”
Eight men held the enemy with difficulty, and
the squad resumed drill while half the party pinned
their prisoner to the field of battle. This ignomini-
ous situation was maintained till one fair-to-medium
policeman arrived and relieved the military of its
responsibility.
THE SONG OF THE WOWSER' CRAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I ride no more in the Drunks’ Express,
Where travellers howl and rave;

Of scraps on the morning pave ;

With yells and a drunken song;
I take no part in a drunken fight,
Or anything else that’s wrong.

With chaps for a gay week-end;
I float no more through the window pane,
Which somebody's got to mend ;'

Nor my tail on someone’s knee ;
My innards have given up spoiling spats
Of passengers next to me.

“Piston”: This war, while doing a minimi
other things, may win a kinder thought for
the rough hands of the engine-room and stoke-
hole than most people have sent down to
them hitherto. Finch, skipper of the Whife
Star liner Arabic, sunk last week by a Gei>
hog submarine, is credited with saying that
the 20 engine-room ratings in the bowels of
his stricken leviathan deserved 20 Victoria
Crosses for the way they stood by their posts.
He more particularly mentioned the third
engineer and the electrical engineer, who
Carried on to certain death in the faint hope
of giving the passengers a chance. One has
only to look at the ’midship section of a big
Ocean liner to see what poor prospects the
engineers and their crews have in the event
of a torpedo bumping into the craft. But the
personal chance of life is habitually made
a secondary consideration to the chancC of
saving others by keeping steam on the ship;
for while there’s steam there’s hope. “The
Nelson touch” has not been inherited only
on the quarter-deck.
WOMAN’S WORK.
“You may say what you like, Charles, hut
if that child’s trousers had been cut on
the bias they would have set ever so
much better.”
IT'S ALL ILL-WIND THAT DOESN'T BLOW ANYBODY AN EXCUSE.
SHE: “Beast, you promised to come down directly after dinner, and here it's just gone
12 o'clock!”
HE: “Mosht unjust, m’dear, mosht unjust! For your sake, been (hie) helping the
offishers watch for shubmarines.”
One of the lntmors of the Tasmanian
recruiting campaign comes from Penguin,
in the- nor’-west. An Austrian ex-consul is
a prominent citizen, and local feeling was
all in favor of making him chairman of the
meetihg. He wasn’t, but it took all the
protests of the visiting speakers to prevent
it. 5,

The Anglican Cathedral at Jerusalem re-
cently 'received a visit from a Gerhog officer
in charge of a
squad of Turkish
soldiers. With the
manners of his
kind the Hun sat
in the bishop’s
throne and smoked
cigarettes, while
Privates Ibrahim.
Mahomet and Yus-
suf uprooted the
pavement in front
of the altar and
turned up the soil
to a depth of sev-
eral feet. Finding
not even a stray
thrum, the party,
which had gone to
loot and remained
to prey, at length
returned to bar-
racks, after warn-
ing the Cathedral
clergy to be
more careful in
future. The object
of the visit re-
mained a mystery
till it leaked out
that the Gerliog Intelligence De-
partment had been informed that
the bishop had made a cannon
before the altar. So he had, but
it was only a harmless elderly
parson who was admitted to a new
dignity, and who emits no more
asphyxiating gas than is produced
by the sermons of any other canon or dean.
By the way, Archbishop Clarke, of Mel-
bourne, is an honorary canon of Jerusalem
Cathedral.
That dot in Bass’s Straits, King Island,
is doing its bit, anyhow. It! has sent to the
war over 100 men, being above 25 per cent,
of the males over 18 years of age residing on
the speck. If the married males who, are
eager to enlist can get away, King Island
will be almost denuded of men.
Even Robert Blatchford :
I rap out the demand that the V.C. should carry
knighthood.
And The Bulletin raps back the demand
that, instead, knighthood should carry the
V.C. —and earn it.

The reckless women who go into the
middle of Adelaide’s streets to wait for
their tramcars have killed somebody at last.
As things happened, it was not one of them-
selves, but a cyclist. Pat Auld, wine mer-
chant, and son of the man of the same name
who accompanied McDouall Stuart on the
great first-across-Australia journey, was
motoring into town, and encountered the
usual throng. While he was trying to avoid
killing some of them a young fellow well
known on the lacrosse-field came cycling
in from a side street, and was fatally
bumped. Verdict: accidental death. No
wonder that an Irish constable lately re-
marked, when frenzied with point-duty in
King William-street: “An immoral town
this, entirely! Ye can not keep the women
off the streets!”
Holy Church is not sighing over the recent
defeat of widow McQuilkin, of Melbourne, in
a breach-of-promise court. Mrs. McQuil-
kin sued for £lOOO damages from Henry
Grogan. He practically pleaded his Protest-
antism as an excuse for not marrying the
staunch R.C. widow. This defence was too
strong for the attack, inasmuch as the lad.y
admitted that she wouldn’t have taken the
plunge without a special dispensation from
the Pope, and she couldn’t show any reason
why his Holiness, would be likely to strain
a point in her case. So Henry blew the
widow out. The result will remind Pro-
destans in general that a man of their sort
can get no damages from a rich Roman
fiance who throws him over because she
can’t convert him ; also it gives every daugh-
ter of the R. C. Church to understand that
she can’t collect financial comfort from a
Protestant suitor who declines to be con-
verted. If she lets him hug her on the
understanding that he will “consider the
matter of becoming a Roman Catholic,” she
is not entitled to consider it settled. Her
religious convictions simply serve the fickle
heretic as an avenue of escape, and that’s
all about it. In this case the fair com-
plainant had only herself to blame if her
expectations ran high. Grogan told the
Court that when he put the ring on the
widow’s finger he bade her not to regard it
as an unconditional engagement, but to
reckon that the contract would be absolutely
“off” if.either of them “found anything out”
concerning the other. A wiser widow would
have closed the interview with the remark
that her alleged admirer had already re-
vealed himself sufficiently.
“Sarto”: Albury (N.S.W.) has a Grace
Darling of its own. The other evening a
man was crossing the flooded Murray per
boat when one of his oars broke and he
drifted down the stream till he struck a
submerged tree and capsized. He hung to
the snag and yelled for help. His adjacent
wife, being informed of the danger of her
property, took a boat and lantern and all
her courage, missed the scattered snags
despite the darkness, and rescued her other
half just as he was considering what sort ot
excuse he would make to Father Peter for
waking him at so inconvenient an hour.
Lament of a man who . journeyed from
Kimberley to Perth to enlist, and who, after
a week in camp, was rejected for some ail-
ment detected by the doctor: —
I’ve more than once spent 23 out of the 24 hours
in the saddle. I haven’t seen a bed for eight years
or more ; I’ve had the stars for a tent for longer than
that. I’ve shot Toos and ’gators under all conditions
and in a'll attitudes, and haven’t often missed. I’ve
eaten nothing but the toughest ever since I’ve been
there. I’ve slept in wet clothes with water running
around me. I haven’t had a change for weeks, and
never chummed up with a cold. And now they
reckon I’m not fit to go to the blasted war! Spate
me, that’s a nice way to treat a bushman who wants
to have a go at the crowd that settled my
mate! Look, ask Pearce, will you, if he’ll pick the
toughest permanent man he’s got, and I’ll stand down
without a word if he’ll keep going with me for a
fortnight in the bush 1
“Fax”: The bitter cry of the patriot who
doesn’t want to be war-taxed has something
behind it when he is a £4 a-week husband,
with a young family attached, who com-
pares himself with a £3 a-week bachelor ex-
pressly exempted from taxation. No Govern-
ment can. tackle the task of-equitably treating
income values unless it starts by considering
the marriage question, and then proceeds to
view the individual in his domestic condi-
tions. There’s the “poor married man”
whose wife has £lOO a year of private in-
come which goes unscheduled, and who is
possibly the loudest bleater of the lot. There’s
the other benedict whose own personal ex-
penditure out of a small income boils down to
two-and-six per week for luxuries. And so on.
The bachelor on the limit line runs in all
shapes, of course. He may be a comparatively
gay dog, or the lean support of a widowed
mother. But, in any case, he isn’t the lawful
victualler and clothier of a wife and kiddies.
An income tax Act may shut its eyes to the
problem of how to differentiate between
married men and bachelors. But it can’t
close its ears to the wail of the small wage-
earner who has his quiver-full. The fact is
that a tax on bachelors demands a place in
the present state of things. The Govern-
ment which doesn’t conscript the jaunty £3
a-week shirker is in duty bound to make him
pay something towards the cost of the war.
“Moana”: The Arbitration award, which
made it a breach for a steamer steward to
accept a tip, came into force on the Maori-
land coast on August 1. But passengers are
still handing out small change, and stewards
are still grabbing it as greedily as ever. What
kind of men are these? They go to the Arbi-
tration Court and talk about the dignity of
labor, and curse tips and plead to be paid a
reasonable wage; and then when they secure
what they have been fighting for they throw
aside all their “dignity” and go open-handed
for tips as of yore. If they lose what they’ve
gained, serve them right.

THE LITTLE HOUSE UNDER THE HILL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Where Duke-street’s huddled shoulders stoop,
Near-by to Butler’s Stairs,
Its sign, which spoke of wider fields,
Came to you unawares.
’Twas set itself in narrow fields
Where tree and flower grew,
Before the ancient bricks uprose
That made the crowded ’Loo.
And close at hand the Very Best,
In mansions row decayed,
Were finely housed, and gardens grew
Where careless children played.
The “quality” moved up the hill
That looms above the ’Loo. .. .
But Potts Point long has lost its day,
And it is faded, too..
The boarder now has crowded in,
And put the Best to rout;
And they, with all their greatness, still
Are moving further out.
But in his own degree of caste
The hoarder, too, is vain ;
He views the crowd below the hill
With something of disdain.
As lie who lives at Darling Point,
Which now to hashdom rots,
Despises in his lofty heart
The very name of Potts.
The’Lillie House beneath the Hill
Has seen mutations strange—
The flow of Sydney by its door,
The tide of rapid change.
To-day the very sign is gone,
And yet there somehow stays
A pleasant memory of the ’Loo,
And of its better days.

CHEMIST TELLS HOW TO STOP
INDIGESTION.
SAYS USE OF PEPSIN LEADS TO
CHRONIC DYSPEPSIA.
“It is a wonder some of us have stomachs
left,” remarked a well-known chemist re-
cently. While all chemists sell a score or
more of stomach remedies for which there is
a wide demand, most of them are just pep-
sin pills, which aid digestion of the food that
is in the stomach at the moment. They have
no curative or strengthening effect, on the
stomach at all, and of course do not reach
or cure the cause. So the same people keep
on coming here and buying and using them
until they are real chronic dyspeptics. When
anyone really asks my advice, I swear by
and recommend ordinary bisuratcd magnesia,
which doesn’t digest the food at all. but acts
as an antacid and sweetens the sour, fer-
menting contents of the stomach. That stops
the pain, heartburn, sour rising', wind, float-
ing, fulness, etc.j in just a few minutes, and
the stomach digests its food without help or
trouble, which is the proper Avay.
“Doctors make mistakes sometimes, too.”
he continued. “My own aunt had all kinds
of trouble with her stomach for years. She
bought and used several styles of digestive
pills, but got worse right along, as naturally
site would. Finally she went to a doctor,
who nearly scared her to death by telling her
she had cancer of the stomach. She came to
me with his prescription, and told me what
he said. I thought it was nonsense. I
sent her to another doctor whom I knew
very well, and lie d'dn’t tell her anything,
but just gave her this same thing, bisurated
magnesia. She took it for two weeks, and
never has had any stomach trouble since,
and that’s three years ago. She’s my own
aunt, and I know this for a fact. Yes, a lot
of bis urn ted magnesia—note the name care-
fully, as other kinds are lacking in its pecu-
liarly valuable properties—is sold through-
out Australia. All the chemists have it, I
suppose, and all you take is half a teaspoon-
ful in a little water after every meal. It’s
all right.”*

Another useful Australian went to balance
his account when Joseph Th.ver died at
Lameroo (S.A.) recently. The improve-
ment of wheat was his specialty, and the
Commonwealth cannot estimate what it
owes to his experiments. Thirty years
ago samples of his crops' were famous, and
his home glittered with trophies won by his
seed grains. The dead agriculturist was
born at Mount Pleasant (S.A.) in 1839.
The loss of Lieut.-Colonel Frank Powell
is the biggest South Aus. has suffered in
Avar since Hubbe, commanding the Bushmen,
was killed in S’Afriea. He was not the
Colonel Powell familiar in Adelaide’s mili-
tary affairs for the past 20 years; that is
James, his uncle. Frank Powell was one
of the few old enough to be an officer in the
Boer campaign and young enough for active
service in this bigger affair. He earned a
captain’s rank during the time when He
Wet was being rounded up, yet was only
39 when he met his death last week in Gal-
lipoli, as colonel (and acting-brigadier) of
the so-called Light Horse. In private life
he was a fruit expert.

Of a soldier-parson who simply had to
fight -
Killed in action at Gallipoli, Everard Digges la
Touche, Anglican parson and lieutenant In the Aus-
tralian expeditionary force, aged 31. After winning
brilliant University honors in the ould dart —-he was
a Master of Arts and Doctor of Literature of Trinity
College, Dublin, and had held the Donnellart Lecture-
ship, one of the highest distinctions which that Uni-
versity can bestow —Digges ia Touche Came to Aus-
tralia five years ago as a newly-fledged parson in
search of health after a severe attack of phthisis.
Unfortunately, in his luggage came the sectarian
hatreds of his birthplace; and as he eouid riot keep
his shillelagh still for long, his name soori became
familiar as that of a doughty controversialist from
the Orange point of view. Even more than “Rome,”
the “High Church” Anglicans were to him like a
red rag to a bull; and coming from Ireland, where
“High Churchism” or “Ritualism” is practically
unknown, he was horrified to find that over the greater
part of Australia the “High Church” section of his
denomination was on top, and that even in Sydney
it was all his own party could do to hold the fort
against “Ritualism” on the one hand and '“Rational-
ism” (which he identified with “Broad Church”
Anglicanism) on the other. Digges sot himself to
turn the tide. After filling a couple of small charges
near Bendigo (Vic.) and at Glen Innes (N.S.W.),
lie became so well known as a leader of sallies against
“Ritualism” that Archbish. Wright brought him to
Sydney as diocesan missioner and lecturer to rein-
force tlie “Low Church” position. Digges threw
himself into the fray with all the energy which his
six-foot-three of vigorous manhood indicated, and the
“Rits” and the “Rats” alike had a bad time. He
assisted meanwhile in the training of students for the
Anglican priesthood at Moore College, Sydney; and
for a time he followed the inky way as chief contro-
versialist on tlie staff of the Church Record, a “Low
Church” weekly which has languished since he ex-
changed the surplice for khaki. As he was no
respecter of persons where his principles were in-
volved, he took an independent line in many matters
other than those for which lie had been brought to
Sydney, till it was an open secret in Anglican circles
that his relations with Archbishop Wright had be-
come very strained. They came near breaking point
on the declaration of war, when he enlisted in the
ranks in flat defiance of episcopal instructions. His
struggles to get to the Front were mentioned in a
recent Bulletin par. In spite of his pugnacity,
Digges la Touche liad a personality which completely
won the hearts of many to whom his opinions were
unspeakably detestable. He fought hard, but without
squirting venom ; and the twinkle in his eye robbed
the blows of half their sting. His frank, boyish
manner, with his infectious laugh and unfailing good
temper, made friends for him among his keenest
antagonists, and he was personally the very opposite
of the dour bigot which those who knew only his
fiery letters might have imagined him to be.
Maoriland Chief-Justice Stout lias been
weeping copiously from the Bench about
“young men going into hotels in the middle
of a great war.” Stout also wept when they
sampled the brew in times
of peace. In fact, the sight
of a pub blinds him with
tears at any time. And the
spectacle of a citizen at the
business end of a pewter
causes him such acute agony
that he immediately rushes
into a confectioner’s shop
for an acid-drop to put
under his tongue. That
done, he is ready to make
offensive remarks at Bung.
Yet there is a lot Stout
doesn’t know about malt
and hops. lie once laid
down with great weight the
dictum that a man was not
drunk so long as he could
ask for more. The rest of
the Full Bench knew better,
and with a reminiscent grin threw the
Chief’s theory into the dust-cart.
Private John Wren told the reporters,
when they said he might find it cold camping
out these nights, that he had been an
outdoor-sleeper for many years. Wren’s
dwelling at Studley Park, Kew, is fitted up
with a “room” having two walls and a roof,
and tin re he has taken the night air ever
since lie went to dwell among his fellow-
opulents.
The last man in the world to heat abotit
the war trudged into Invercargill (M.L.)
early this month, and, dropping his swag oil

marked that he would have been round

It transpired that at the beginning of July,
1014, lie stepped off the world by going to
Preservation Inlet, at
the extreme bottom
end of the South

handed prospecting
tour. He took 12
months’ tucker and
arranged with a
steamer to drop in
with another supply
in a year’s time. The
craft duly called, and
then the astonished
hatter learnt that
the biggest scrap in
all history was rag-
ing like fury and that
he was the last mail
on earth to get the
news. But he de-
served a better fate
than to be landed at

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“I am thinking- of I’at Martin,”
Said Phelim Burke to me,
With his droll ways and his laughter,
And his manhood young- and free ;
W e were blanket mates together
For a score of years and more—
-1 was Irish-to the marrow,
He Australian to the core.
“When the roads were hard to travel
And we perished for a bite
He would share his little with me,
And I always found him white;
He was kind as kind in sickness,
And in trouble true and stout—
A mate in Full-and-Plenty,
And a friend in Down-and-Out.
"Where the streets of Full-and-Plenty
Through the golden sunshine wind,
It s no lack of brother-friendship—-
Milk o’ kindness—that you'll find ;
And at every turn and corner
You will meet with greetings then
From the sweet eyes of the colleens
And the glad hands of the men.
“But if Down-and-Out’s your township,
You will find its people shy,
And it’s kicks instead o' ha’pence
That you'll get from passers-by;
l or it seems their human nature
Is a little warped the while,
And their smiie of glowing welcome
Is a very absent smile.
W ell, we shouldered on together
In a friendship frank and fine
That stood the stress of hardship
And the test of wet and shine,
Shirring here and fencing yonder,
Hr ringbarking, it might be—
Ah, God be with the old times!”
Said Phelim Burke to me.
“Twenty years without a quarrel—
Foul or fair, or wet or dry—•
Isn't that the kind of mateship
That can hold its head on high?
For, where two are long together,
I here the Devil gets to work.
And remember 1 was Irish,
Through and through,” said Phelim Burke.
“Faith, with Want himself the master,
And his bitter-hard demands,
And the crawling sweat upon us,
And the corns upon our hands,
And the need that aches within us
For a nobler, kinder state,
'Tis scant room that we, the toilers,
Should allow to thoughts of hate.
“Nay, ’tis brother-love that’s needed
(And ’tis that alone will live),
And the kindly hand in trouble,
And the kind heart to forgive;
And I often said to Patrick,
As we rested after work :
Trust the Future’; and he’d answer;
‘Aye, and help it, Phelim Burke!’
“And ’twas oft a-nigh the red logs,
While the flames leapt high and higher,
And the big black night about us,
And we looking in the fire,
That we mused for hours together
On the Forward March of Man,
And put forth our thoughts to help it,
And to purpose and to plan.
“Then,” said Burke, “the Big War started”—
And his blue eyes lighted up—
“ May the men who set it going
Sup and sup of Sorrow’s cup !
May they know the pain of parting-
And the bitter salt of tears,
And their lives be bowed and bothered,
And their years be haunted years !
“For, ’twas they that did the damage
With their murder and their might,
And their talk of World Dominion,
And their spoiling for a fight.
And they’ve got it —got it fairly,
And they’ll cry enough anon,
Though the Devil at their elbow
With a grimace spurs them on!
“T had known him twenty summers—
Since our roving life began ;
But I little knew my Patrick,
Or the makings of the man;
For the mood that came upon him
Was a restless, fitful mood;
And the war went working, working
Like red yeast within his blood.
“For the old, old strain was In him,
And he could not help hut fight,
And the army called and got him,
And he stole away one night.
There Were other roads before him,
hut he chose the soldier's way.
lie was brave, a true Australian,,..
And that’s all there is to say.”
“All, I’helim?” “Aye,” he answered,
And his face was grey to see —
“By the love of his dead mother,
He was more than mate to me.
He was mate and more, I tell y0u....
And he fell before the Turk. . . .
And at night I do be thinking
Of Patrick Martin Burke !”

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
The Victorian Motorbus Co., Ltd. (Mel-
bourne). —The first report of this co., cover-
ing the period from December 4, 1913, to
March 4, 1915, is a remarkable document.
The authorised capital is £135,000 in 90,000
fully paid 10s. shares and 180,000 contri-
buting 10s. shares. Though only 15,438 con-
tributing shares have been allotted (and
presumably that is all that have been
applied for), the whole 90,000 payable to
the vendor have been issued. The present
paid capital is £46.534, “of which £1534
has been paid up in money, and £45,000
otherwise than in money.” So far as the
accounts indicate, the co. has got nothing
tangible for this £45,000. At any rate, there
is no asset against it, the entry on the assets
side being simply “Amount payable to ven-
dor under contract in terms of prospectus,
£45,000.” Worse than that, the vendor was
to get in cash £1750. That is to say, he
was entitled to get more in cash than the
whole amount thus far paid by the public ;
and, so far as the accounts indicate, he
was not to hand over in return so much
as a wheel or a tin of lubricating oil. Of
course he hasn’t got his £1750 yet; but he
has had £525, and is shown as a creditor
for the balance. One ’bus seems to have
been bought at a cost of £650, and so unsuit-
able a purchase was it that thus far £307
has been spent on altering it. For the rest
£566 has been paid as a deposit on two
chasses. To buy one ’bus, alter it, run it
for a few months, and pay a deposit on two
chasses this co., with a capital of £46,534,
has got into debt to the extent of £1761 —
a trifle more than the one ’bus and the two
deposits cost. And besides the £1761 the
co. is indebted to the vendor £1225 and for
“outstanding directors’ fees, £875.” In other-
words, the unpaid and outstanding directors’
fees at the end of the cb.’s first “period”
amount to nearly two-thirds of the capital
thus far got in from the public! All that
can be said about a Companies law which
makes it possible for a concern to issue such
figures is that it is badly in need of drastic
alteration. Repeatedly The Bulletin has
drawn attention to the weakness of the law
which permits a vendor to take the full
amount of his promoters’ shares, whether
the whole or a mere microscopic percentage
of the shares offered to the public are sub-
scribed. It might be possible for a co. loaded
with 90,000 vendor’s fully paid shares to
pay decently if 180.000 shares were sub-
scribed by the public; but what chance have
the people who actually put up the money
got when, instead of 180 000 shares, all that
the public takes is 15,435?

There’s a lot of credit due to somebody. The
co. started with a capital of less than
£SO,OOO, of which £45,000 was, represented
by goodwill. Put in another way, less than
£35,000 of tangible assets had to earn divi-
dends for £BO,OOO. And they did it. The 10
p.c. with which the co. started was main-
tained without any difficulty whatever. Not
only was it maintained, but surplus profits
were accumulated until the whole of the
£45,000 which at the start was represented
only by nebulous goodwill is to-day repre-
sented by things that you can see and feel.
And the management has done more than
that. It has been paying 10 p.c. on £26,250
of new capital as well. And this isn’t a case
where anybody could have done it. Half a
dozen eating-shop cos. were floated in Sydney
during the last boom in industrials. This is
the only one which has been anything of a
success. Most of them have been shocking
failures.
Still you don’t always get rid of
goodwill by accumulating enough re-
serves to counterbalance the formal
goodwill item. Suppose you struck
a brilliant idea for growing whales,
and formed a co. with a capital of £500,000
to do it. taking £lOO,OOO for the idea, and
using £350,000 in building ponds at sea to
serve as nests for the hen-whales. True, the
goodwill would nominally be only £100,000;
but if the business refused to pay exes, the
£350,000 would as surely be gone as if it
were represented by goodwill. In other
words, there is a sort of goodwill represented
by the difference in the value of a plant or
premises to a particular co. and the money
it would fetch on liquidation. It is, there-
fore, advisable to see what a co.’s assets con-
sist of. In the case of Sargent’s here is the
list:—

r J_hat amount is made up as follows:
Capitai £106,250
Calis paid m advance . . 5,177
Reserves as above . . . . 2,697
Half-year’s dividend . . . . 5,208
In view of the fact that £22.000 is’in lease-
holds and £56,440 in furniture and plant it
cannot be said that the capital is in gilt-
edged securities. In fact, a large amount
ot the camtal is in assets which depend for
their value upon the continued profitableness
ot the business. And that again depends
upon management.
But even the exceptional management
Avith which Sargent’s has been blessed could
not have made such profits had not the con-
ditions of Sydney in particular been favor-
able. Last half-year they changed for the
worse, and the profits show the effect. The
current half-year will continue to do the
same thing, prices of necessaries being so
dear. And on top of that there is the ebb
ot our wonderful wave of prosperity. The
margin over.and above dividend has been so
wide, nevertheless,, that the co. may possi-
bly pull through without diminishing its divi-
dend.

Bjabilities have thus been reduced from
£l_Si)(jb to £101,458 in 10 years. Meantime
a trifle of the Cascade estate may have been
sold, and maybe a pub here and there isn’t
quite what it was 10 years ago. On the
whole, however, it seems safe to say that the
assets are worth quite as much as they were
10 years ago. If they are, the co. is obvi-
ously £21.108 better off, because that much
debt lias been wiped out. It isn’t progress
that is likely to bring the co. into conflict
with the traffic constables in Hobart; still
every £20,000 of debt that is pushed out by
undivided profit makes it easier to push out
another £20,000. The co.’s large holding of
unproductive land around its brewery,
coupled with the big debt (largely due to
that holding), has always stood in the way of
corpulent profits; and any new taxation
which comes along is likely to do this co.
more harm than most manufacturing and
trading cos. On the other hand, Aus-
tralia has tasted the beer and cider of
Tasmania, and begins to ask for more. Thus,
though the clouds hanging over most cos. in
the liquor business are pretty dark, there is
a speck or two of silver showing ahead of the
Cascade.

Surplus profits are not piling up reserves
at a conspicuous rate. It is highly probable
that the management doesn’t want them to.
\Vhen you know you shouldn’t be paying
any more than (sq.y) 10 p.c. dividend, and
when you have decided not to pay any more
for a few years, there is a type of director
that asks, Yv hat’s the use then of showing
profit much in excess of what is needed to
pay the dividend?” Such directors see one
very good reason for not showing things in
their rosiest light; if they did that, all those
having any dealings with them would reckon
that they were doing too well and might
yield a bit here and there without hurting
themselves. Of course, if directors feel like
that, there is, especially in a concern like
this, plenty of ways in which the surplus
can be disposed of. Stock-in-trade and book
debts may, for instance, be written down
wholesale; and nobody can trace it. And
excellent reasons can invariably be shown
for adopting that policy. In a stock of this
sort, valued now at £64,837, a Board can
claim that large provision ought to be made
for shrinkage in market value, wastages
etc. As a matter of fact, if substantial pro-
vision. is not made for contingencies, a co.
in this business is liable to find itself in
trouble on an exhaustive stock-taking. Some
years ago the biggest Maoriland drug co.
found that out when it overhauled one or
two of its branches.
Whether too much or too little profit has
been written off by the Australian Drug Co.
this paper doesn’t know. It will be sur-
prised, however, if too little has been
written off. In view of the large stocks in
hand on June 30, 1014, and the subsequent
rise in the price of chemicals, it will also
be surprised if, in addition to the profit of
£8921 shown above, a very substantial sum
was _ not available to lay by for contin-
gencies. At the present time stock and book
debts total £108,996. Four years ago it
was £116,741. That shrinkage may be due
to reduction of stocks, etc., or to writing
down out of profits. Apart from stock and
book debts the assets in 1911 were £16,902
and the liabilities (5 p.c. debentures, etc.)
£44,591. To-day the liabilities are £44,495,
but the assets other than stock and book
debts are £31,787. On the surface there
has been a solid though not startling im-
provement ; underneath it is possible there
have been also considerable changes to
strengthen the foundations.

* Subject to remarks hereunder.
The first year’s profit wasn’t really profit at
all, and some at least of the subsequent
year’s profit wasn’t profit either. It was
really revenue in excess of actual outgoings.
But in addition to the actual outgoings
there were contingent liabilities —liabilities
in respect of the unexpired portion of the
policies. The management of this concern—
one of the straightest and cleanest formed
during the company-promotion boom of
three or four years ago—doesn’t throughout
call the surplus for even the past year profit,
though on appearances a good deal of it
actually was profit. As the net premiums
for the past year were only about £3OOO
greater than for the previous year, it is
probable that £l5OO would cover the extra
unexpired risks, which would leave an
actual profit of oyer £2500. That is nearly
i p.c. on the capital. But the management
does the right thing in deferring dividends
a while longer and strengthening its un-
earned premium reserve. When that re-
serve amounts to 40 p.c. of the net premium
income—which at present will mean about
£lO,OOO altogether—the shareholders may
fairly get a bite.
As mentioned just now, the co. started
well. All its capital, less £4039 spent on
preliminary exes., was and still is repre-
sented by hard cash and investments; and
the interest earned last year was equal to
£4 3s. p.c. on the whole of the paid capital
(£37,976). This sound position gives clients
all the security they can reasonably want.
And, coupled with the quality of the man-
agement, it gives the shareholders strong
reason to expect that they have got into a fire
insurance concern which is going to live;
and when a fire insurance concern lives it
is usually very profitable indeed.

The slump in profits six months ago was said
to be due' to the war, but the directors were
then “pleased to report that good orders are
now in _ hand and profitable business is
assured.” Early in the next round drought
got its blow in—“several important contracts
which were in hand could not be completed
as no water was available to fill the pipes.”
But, rains having fallen, “the manufacture
and laying of the pipes is now being pro-
ceeded with.” The current half-year may
therefore show much better results. It is,
nevertheless, hard to see anything but a dull
time for this co. when the present jobs are
finished. The money that is put into wood-
pipes is nearly all derived from loans or new
capital issues; and loans and capital issues
except for war purposes are going to be very
rare birds presently. Later on," when men
begin to pour back from Europe, it is likely
that Australia will have to face one of the
biggest unemployed difficulties it has ever
had to grapple with. Whether any loan
money will be available then is uncertain.
Maybe, some may be raised at very stiff
prices; but every possible penny of it will go
into wages, and as little as possible into
materials. Fortunately this co. enters these
harder times with no great burden of debt to
hump through. Its liabilities of all kinds
total £18,844, which could almost be extin-
-B'uished by book debts. There is another
£43.036 in stock ; and no doubt a lot of this
will be realised in completing the contracts
referred to as in hand. Evidently the- man-
agement sees the wisdom of reducing stocks :
they were £52,079 12 months ago, and are
£9OOO less now. Apart from the stocks and
the book debts, the only other asset of any
consequence is property (freehold mostlv)
and plant, £34,232 wonderfully little con-
sidering the size of the turnover. This latter
feature is, of course, all to the good: it
means comparatively little capital locked up
in unfruitful assets during the dry times.

Last year’s drought didn’t have nearly such a
disastrous effect on the co. as the dry spell
around 1903 did. In the bad times that fol-
lowed that year it was found necessary to
write off £73,384 of the capital. But this has
now been returned, and the co. hands out an
111 p.c. dividend on the original paid capital
without any difficulty. Capital stands at
£165,114; but the co. has wisely built up
such very considerable reserves in the past
few good years that it has no less than
£202,840 in “freeholds, leaseholds, land anc,
plant” alone. And it has not gone very
deeply into debt in the process. Liabilities
consist of a mortgage of £17,654 and £31,919
of sundry creditors, while assets, apart from
the property item, include £29,070 of sundry
debtors, £19,580 of stocks and £24,776 of
cash and public securities. This table com-
pares this half-year’s position with that of a
few former years :—-
. June, TO. Dec.,’l3. Dec., 14. June, T 5.
Liquid assets. . £58,750 £119,073 £78,970 £73,427
Liabilities . . 16,204 25,495 60,325 49,573
Surplus .. £42,546 £93,578 £18,645 £23,854
There has thus been a pretty considerable
reduction in the liabilities in the six months,
but a reduction in liquid assets reduces the
six months’ improvement to £s2o9—which
is. of course, after paying the 11* p.c. divi-
dend and providing for actual additions,
renewals and repairs. Naturally the drought
and to some extent increased freights affected
the year s operations, as far as meat-freezing
is concerned; but there are good prospects
ahead of this branch, into which a lot of the
accumulated profits were put a couple of
years ago. Other branches will doubtless
be affected by the harder times that are
ahead of us; but there are not very many
cos. that can suffer a larger cut and still pay
a 10 p.c. dividend.

In view of the new interest taken in the
Australian metal business on account of
Germany’s past connection with it, it is
w °rth while giving this some space.
First, to get the amount written off out of
the way: it is made up, so far as the past
half-year is concerned, of £6520 to cover
depreciation and £6OOO put by to cover the
discount at which £200,000 of debentures
were recently issued. As usual, the profits
for the half-year are more or less of a
guess, and it takes a good guesser to hit the
bull s-eye just now. For instance, “metals
unrealised and concentrates on hand” are
valued at £222,000. Whether they will real-
ise that much or several thousands more or
several thousands less nobody can tell. The
management’s one advantage in guessing is
that the accounts are made up to June 30,
and the auditors don’t pass them till six
weeks later, and during that time a certain
quantity of the metal, etc., in hand on June
30 is actually disposed of. Even so, prices
are not finally settled, in some cases, until
months afterwards.
. Taking all the troubles of the half-year
into account, the result must bring a smile
to the face of people who lately haven’t had
much to smile about. No doubt there are
some people who, remembering how metals —
spelter in particular—aeroplaned for a few
months, expected that this, in common with
other Broken Ilill cos., would show colossal,
profits. Spelter was worth, for a time, over
£lOO per ton. But that was only because
these Broken Hill cos. couldn’t get their stuff
to market in the usual quantities, and the
Yankees, being then practically the sole
suppliers, played the game at which they can
beat the world. It is necessary to explain
again shortly what this co.’s operations are.
Its ore goes to the lead mill first, and a
first crop of silver-lead concentrates is har-
vested. Hitherto this disgraceful co. sold
its silver-lead concentrates to German metal
works. Now, having been nicely rounded up,
it has bought £200,000 worth of interest in
the Port Pirie works, and for the future
ui S i cro P of silver-lead concentrates is
likely to be smelted in Australia. These
concentrates represent about 20 per cent,
(weight) of the ore. Another 62 per cent,
consists of tailings ; another 14 per cent, of
slimes ; the balance—about 4 per cent.—is
also tailings, but there is very little metal in
them, and they are dumped underground
straight away. (This filling'takes the place

Efficient grinding is one of the many problems
that mine managers have to solve. The Hardinge
Conical Mills have proved to the Calumet and Hecla
Mining Co. that grinding is not such a difficult
problem ; they have installed 64 of them, and say
“the Hardinge Conical Mill is the most efficient
grinding machine we have yet gotten hold of.” If
they say this of the mills, it should be worth the
while of mine managers here to inquire about them.

wealth, and will be glad to forward particulars.* [1

of timber, of which a forest —all imported
was formerly used underground.) The object
of the first concentration is to get out as
much silver and lead as possible, and leave
as much zinc as possible behind. The tail-
ings contain about 17 per c-ent. zincthat .is
to say, about 73 per cent, of all the zinc that
was in the original ore is left in the tailings,
along with a little lead and a good deal ot
silver. It is this stuff —-for many years a
refuse—which the local zinc cos. handle, oo
far as this South Co. is concerned, the Amal-
gamated (De Bavay’s) Co. takes the current
output; the Zinc Corporation has bought the
stuff that was accumulated in the days before
the flotation process was operated. The
slimes (representing about 14 P-c- of the
ore) have been dumped, and there are 410,000
tons of them waiting to be treated by a modi-
fied flotation process when the war-dog goes
back to his kennel. They, by the way, are
worth about 11 p.c. lead, 6oz. silver, and 14
p.c. zinc, though much cleaner work than
that is done nowadays.
This co.’s “tailings,” then, containing the
bulk of the zinc, so to two local treatment
cos. What zinc doesn’t go to them is not
recovered at all: 12 or 13- p.c. of it, for
instance, is lost in the silver-lead concen-
trates. These treatment cos. re-grind most
of the stuff, get out as much of the silver
and lead as they can wash off (which isn t
very much), and then put the balance
through the flotation process. The result is
a zinc concentrate worth about 45 p.c. zinc.
This is the stuff all the trouble is about.
Nine-tenths of it has hitherto gone to Ger-
man smelting works —including German-
controlled works in Belgium. Liege lias for
years largely lived on Broken Hill. A hen
war started the bottom fell out of this busi-
ness. The Zinc Corporation shut down. De
Bavay’s made a better fight of it, and sold
a few parcels of concentrates, mostly to the
U.S.A., a little to France. Hence, while no
deliveries of old tailings were made in the
past half-year, De Bavay’s _ took all the
South’s current output. This greatly im-
proved the financial results. The deliveries
of tailings and the revenue credited to tail-
ings for the past three half-years are as
follows:—-
Old Tailings. Current Output.
tons. tons. Revenue.
June, 1914.. 36,373 107,019 £34,/94
Dec., 1914.. 8,312 69,943 24,1,9
June, 1915.. Nil 80,880 68,211
Thus the amount credited to Working
account from tailings in the half-year ended
June, 1914, averaged ss. lOd. per ton; in
the next half-year (is. 2d ; in the past half-
year 16s. lOd. But of the £68,221 credited
for the past half-year it is possible that a
considerable part represented surpluses real-
ised on the deliveries actually made in the
preceding term—receipts, that is, over and
above the amount then estimated as receiv-
able. In the aggregate we get this result.
For the half-year preceding the war 172,330
tons of ore and 36,373 tons of old tailings
were handled for a-gross profit of £146,756;
in the past half-year 130,320 tons of ore alone
gave a gross profit of £136,291. The result
is all in favor of the past term, so far as
profit per ton is concerned. The aggregate
profit was not, however, so large, because the
Port Pirie smelters were not able to keep the
mine going full time. Further, but for the
much larger revenue from zinc, the figures
would have slumped badly owing, apparently,
to the heavier cost of realising the silver-
lead output.
The figures for the half-year, since they
owe so much to the war-boom in spelter,
which was manipulated in the U.S.A., are not
any guide to the future. And it is doubtful
whether figures of earlier terms are much of
a guide either. A large part of the profit
of the past few years has come from zinc ;
and with the German metal business utterly
disorganised, as it is likely to be after the
war, it is doubtful whether a satisfactory
market will be available for ziuc concentrates
in quantity for years to come.

ated Smelters, Ltd., and another £99,000-odd
is earmarked for a further payment. In 12
months net liquid assets have increased by
nearly £140,000; but the whole increase is
in metal and concentrates; and practically
all the cash formerly in hand is now in con-
centrates, too. This explains the small dis-
bursement in dividends.

To the gross profits of the past half-year
you can, if you like, add £15,000 which has
been charged against revenue and applied
to a sinking fund to reduce the debenture
debt incurred in connection with the steel
works ; and to the gross profits of the pre-
vious half-year you can add £12,500 on the
same account. These amounts will be shown,
no doubt, 'as written off next year, deben-
tures representing this sum having lately
been repurchased and cancelled. The figures
are in any case subject to many explana-
tions. For instance, in the half-year to the
end of November last, no less than £34,885
was paid out in respect of brokerage, com-
mission and discount on the issue of deben-
tures ; and for the past half-year the work-
ing account shows that, whereas only
£56,307 is credited to iron and steel sales
and products on hand, salaries, wages and
expenses in that department amounted to no
less than £111,480. From this it seems that
well over £50,000 of preliminary expenses in
connection with this great enterprise were
charged against the past half-year’s revenue.
Had the co. done what it fairly might have
done aud written off these preliminary ex-
penses over a series of years, then it would
have been possible to show a gross profit of
about £102,500 for the November term, and
of £285,000 for the past term. From this
there would be written off in the previous
term (say) £45,000 for depreciation, etc.,
leaving £147,500 net; and for the past term
£55.000, leaving £230,000 net. It is pro-
bable tlipse figures give a fairer idea of the
position than those submitted in the
accounts. The co. has, however, preferred
to write off everything in the way of pre-
liminary exes, as it went along, and The
Bulletin isn’t going to complain. Fortu-
nately the war-price obtainable for spelter
has enabled the co. to do it and still show
splendid results.
The Broken Hill cos. when they met the
union delegates last Saturday offered them
a rise all round of Is. per shift, boys in pro-
portion, the advance to hold good during the
currency of the war and for six months
after. The delegates put the matter to a
mass meeting, which turned it down. The
owner of a cool head at the miners’ meeting
who made the democratic proposition that a
ballot should decide the matter couldn’t
even get a seconder. Labor used to say it
was a tremendous reform when onen voting
was abolished and the ballot substituted:
but union bosses still stick to the bad old
wav when it suits them. The demand for
higher wages is complicated by demands for
various other things; and it is nr baffle that
the lot will be rushed into the Federal Arbi-
tration Court. In view of the tremendous
uncertainty regarding future urines of
metals, the fairest thing all'round will be a
sliding scale.
Vegetable Creek, Emmaville (N.S.W.),
after avoiding water troubles for a long
period, has had Chandler’s shaft workings
flooded out. Two months may see conditions
back to normal. Little tin oxide is available
elsewhere on the leases, and production is
expected to drop 70 p.c. during this period.
Weary shareholders have been expressing
dissatisfaction, and the present trouble, being
largely due to a niggardly development
policy, is not likely to increase the Board’s
popularity. No prospecting of any value
has been carried out for a long while, and
the report furnished with yearly accounts
contained nothing new. The necessity of
boring to locate the lead has been recognised
for years ; and the advisability of installing
a rock-drilling plant depends solely on boring
results. Chandler’s block, which cost only
£2OOO, has proved an excellent proposition.
Working profits have been very satisfactory,
and some 400 tons of tin oxide are blocked
out. Yet practically the whole of the profits
go to Gordon Bros., the landlords of the
so-far unpayable areas held by the co. Three
years ago the Board was advised that as
Gordon’s ground had been proved by results
to be unprofitable under the purchase agree-
ment, it should be turned down unless better
terms were forthcoming. A few minor con-
cessions were obtained, but no reduction in
the total price (£25,000). The result lias
been that during the past three years Gor-
don Bros, have pocketed the profits, probably
none of which were obtained from their
ground. Until the landlords are got rid of
shareholders must stand aside. A continu-
ance of the Board’s recent policy will result
in the more accessible portions of the pro-
perty being worked out and the remainder
left unprospected.
Golden Horseshoe (W.A.) steadily im-
proves. The July yield from 24,434 tons
was worth £40,503. After chipping off
£27,812 for working expenses £12,691 re-
mained. Development absorbed £3177, leav-
ing a net surplus of £9514. For July last
year receipts were under £3OOO in excess of
expenditure.
Some of the men who were employed on
Chaffers (W.A.) when it closed are still
waiting for their wages. Exemption of
labor conditions will soon be up, and as
there is a possibility of the reconstructed co.
applying for an extension, the unpaid
workers have resolved to strenuously oppose
any such movement.
Officially it is told that the average of
385,000 cub. yards sluiced by Moline at the
Cock’s Pioneer, Eldorado (l ie.), was practi-
cally 104 d. per cub. yard —gold, 7.82 d.; tin,
2.62 d. per cub. yard. The actual area dealt
with was 3.76 acres. Although the plant
was doing its first run the efficiency was 844
p.c. of full time, which is not bad going. Of
course, 104 d. is below the estimate, which
was about 15d. per cub. yard. But Moline
ventures this explanation : 27 p.c. of the 70ft.
floor had been panelled out by the old
McEvoy Co., and the balance of the bottom
of the paddock was below the value of the
ground worked by that co. Hence the tears.
Overhead the other floors were up to expec-
tations. Losses in tailings did not go above
a penny per cub. yard. Costs can be pre-
sumed to range between 7d. and Bd. Accounts
for the half-year ended May 31 showed
a loss of £3833, but the co. hadn’t then got
in its final haul of tin and gold from the
70ft. floor. At that date assets were £2768
above liabilities, and that total must have
been fairly well swelled by final results. So
it can be said of the co. that, although results
weren’t up to estimates, a profit was made,
and few alluvial shows start off that well.
What J. L. Wharton calls a boring campaign
is now under way, and as half the country-
side is embraced in the Cock’s corner-pegs,
there is plenty of room left for an imagina-
tive effort as to what 20 millions cub. yards
of drift may some day yield.

Frenchman’s, Daylesford (Vic.), which is
suspected of having cut the lead of the good
old Hepburn mineral spring, might as well
close down for evermore. The other week
the Board issued a petition to the hopeless
shareholders for another shilling call (pay-
able in four instalments) for the purpose of
unwatering the shaft and renewing explora-
tions in the bottom level. This was aban-
doned as a worked-out proposition some
time ago, and the locals are hardly like to
throw any more traybits into the wet.

Gilmore (N.Q.), which after the manner
of tin shows made a brief splash in cham-
pagne and then got down to beer, and not
much of that, is still pottering about. Last
half-year (to July 22) it had an income of
£2138, which put the co. in funds again.
The profit was £992, and the bank balance
is now £970. The improvement follows the
picking up of rich veins and bunches in
the North Dolly Gray. Dividends are only
a memory; still the knowledge that £20,850
was paid on a capital of £9OOO keeps hope
alive.
Fred Tricks, of Queen-street (Melb.),lias
in hand the flotation of the Kingston Co.’s
Queen Margaret claims at Yeerongpilly
(Q.). Dick Eades has been doing the pro-
specting. At a cost of £l4OO he has sunk
a shaft 70ft., driven 185 ft. along the course
of the shoot, and done some sampling at
40ft. He tots up that this work proves
250,000 tons of 205.. ore. The main feature
of the formation is its width, so Eades
wants to go 250 ft. north and sink to 140 ft.
so as to pick the shoot up on its pitch. If
he is successful he can add another 25,000
tons to his reserves, and as costs won’t
average 10s. he looks for a decent profit.
The doubt is with regard to values. Ball,
of the Queensland State Geologist’s staff,
isn’t sure that there won’t be also a unit
or two of copper in the dense sulphides
underfoot. As Tricks is the fashion in Mel-
bourne just now he will carry the float
through. But he can’t reckon on an Edna
May in a low-grade deposit of the type of
the Kingston, which, by the way, he has
renamed Mount Taylor.

and making all other preparations for a
smelting campaign. The railway from Cl on-
curry (70-odd miles) is nearly through. The
total railage to Elliott’s smelter is about
140 miles, but ore which gives 10 p.c. can
stand this. The Kalkadoon has developed
two lenses to a depth of 250 ft.. and the
winze below the 250 ft. level also shows
very rich ore at 61ft. A prospecting
shaft known as the Lady Jean at Cuthbert
is at 54ft. carrying 12in. of ore worth 14 p.c.
copper. The financial position is compli-
.cated by the heavy payments of debenture
interest, for comparatively few bonds have
been converted into shares at par. The
debentures carry 7 p.c. interest. The future
hangs on the copper market.

John Brandon and Gordon Lyon have been
revising mine-engineer Clayton’s inspection of
St. Aignan’s, Misima, Papua. On their way
south it leaked out that they liked the show,
though they hated the climate. There isn’t
more than one face at St. Aignan’s, but it’s
350 ft. high and 40ft. wide! Conscientious
Clayton sweated over it all, and the Bran-
don-Lyon smile seems to confirm his estimate,
which wasn’t far short of 255. for a big block
of the face.
Hammering away with low air-pressure
Lyell Blocks (Tas.) early last half-year got
out to 61ft. in its drive north at 1300 ft. and
78ft. in the other south at 1200 ft. But on
April 2 the office lamp burst, and before the
fire was out the old compressor was con-
sumed, so the co. has been hard at work ever
since making calls and putting up a new
plant on the hillside. To cheer the dreary
way the Board selects the particular North
Lyell ore-bodies which it is going to get pre-
sently. At 1300 ft. the directors are after
that mine’s big 41 stope formation, and at
1200 ft. to the south they are hoping for the
Lyell’s 35, 36 and 37 ore bodies. As plant
and development accounts have mopped up
£63.000, nothing but big fish will be much
good.

A
WOMAN’S
LETTER
Sydney, August 23, 1915.
My Dear Arini, —
A small, thin man, with a face like an
oarly-Italian cameo, plus a large moustache.
On liis head a dented felt hat of the foreign-
tourist persuasion. On his arm a heavy
overcoat. The new Belgian musical overseer
of the Conservatorium, Arini. As he en-
tered his new workshop for the first time
on a gorgeous winter afternoon, he
looked as if he needed Australian sun to put
a color into his waxy-pale cheeks. An air of
gentle melancholy—no Belgian can smile
very readily these days—and a virile impres-
sion of intense nervous energy mark the
little musician. How utterly different from
Wiegand, our first imported City Organist,
who was Belgian too!
Y\ ild yelps and growling wails of tuning-
up preceded the Sydney musical fraternity’s
welcome to the new director. The event
had Slapoffski in charge. Mr. Verbrugghen
and his wife had arrived a day late ; hence
a postponement of the official welcome. But
no notice that the pasteboard requesting your
presence at the Conservatorium on Thursday
really invited you to the Technical College
on Friday reached some of the invited, in
consequence they ambled down to the former
address after the official handshake had
finished with a spread at the Ultimo College.
By chance they struck the Musicians’ Union
welcome just mentioned. A dinner at
Farmer’s and more speeches had to be borne
before Verbrugghen laid his musical brow on
Ins pillow that night.
Allies’ Day comes next. Plain citizens,
met to arrange preliminaries, filled the Town
1 fall vestibule to its last chair, and an over-
flow dammed itself up against the wall. Pre-
mier Holman put in the first appeal for the
Little. Countries that welter under the in-
vader’s heel. Chief Justice Cullen, Warmed out
of his frosty judicial calm, made an impas-
sioned effort to stir the pulse of those who
sit back and admire the Australia Day total,
instead of getting another move on. The
McLinen knight dealt out the names of those
chosen for the committee as though they
were good playing cards. Onposition-leader
Wade threw in his support. Russell French,
T. A. Dibbs and Richard Teece were de-
puted, as usual, to take care of the money.
Salvation-Army-officer Birkenshaw, in a
voice like the roaring of a gale through a
tunnel, made an appeal for the Hungry. In
the rear of the assembly a small treble pipe
kept inquiring, “Where is Mr. ?” The
name failed to reach the listening ear.
So the orator’s spectacles merely flashed her
way for a second, and knitting proceeded as
usual.
Kitchener may yet he driven to muzzle his
loquacious sister, Mrs. Parker. Her latest
outbreak of chatter was a naive remark to
the British Women’s Patriotic League.
“When I told him I was going to belong to
the League, he said, ‘Oh. well, I don’t think
it will do much harm.’ ”
The Commonwealth Naval Dockyard will
shortly he dressed in bunting for the launch-
ing of the Torrens. This craft is preceded
by a stately flourish of letters—ll.M.A.T.B.D.
Cm told it means “Huns! May All of Them
Be Devilled.” The new vessel takes the
waters on Saturday.
Colonel Quilter, the long Guardsman who
was so popular here as Lord Denman’s mili-
tary secretary, left a memorial at Coombe
Cottage. As Melba’s guest for a week-end
ho offered to lay-out an Early English walk
through the garden. In spaces between the
slabs he planted daisies, which are now
tossing . their pink-and-wliite heads on
“Quilter’s Walk.” • Fate thrust a sword into
the hands of a man who was chiefly con-
cerned about the color-schemes of sea and
*ky. Writing after tlis fierce thrill of meet-
ing the enemy-hordes in Antwerp he said:
"This is a horrible business—to kill, kill,
-ill till one is killed oneself.” His bullet was
waiting for him in Gallipoli, and he fell as
be. predicted.
The Women’s Labor Committee threatens
! > bombard Senator Pearce with many signa-
tures. They want to instal women-cooks at
Liverpool camp. On one point, at any rate,
I'he military may make its mind easy. The
lady-cook who knows her business is gener-
ally a short-tempered person who attends to
her saucepans. She’ll stand no nonsense and
no young-recruity “followers.” Nothing less
than six-feet of policeman for her!
Jack Steber. a Bank of N. S. Wales
youngster, has been mentioned in lan Ham-
ilton’s despatches. It seems that the order
came to dig in. Billjim wanted to “get to
’em,” and dash (I think it’s “dash”) the
digging in! Then Steber, a 20-year-old
sergeant, announced that his job was to see
that the digging-in was done, and one way
and another he got it done. He’s a Sydney
youngster, and connection with the Bank of
N. S. Wales runs in the family.
The State’s new fish shop, in Oxford-
street, established as a supplement to the
State’s four trawlers, was opened by Chief
Secretary Black, neatly dressed in a white
coat and apron over the usual masculine
duds. A phalanx of police kept the public
off the footpath in front of the big glass
windows. A band in the street gave hilari-
ous snatches if such ditties as “A Life on the
Ocean Wave.” But the noise disturbed the
oratory, so a vassal extinguished it. Mayor
Richards bought £lO worth of mixed scales on
condition that the money was handed to the
Allies’ Day Fund. This was agreed to, and
the bargains were sent off to a hospital.
After George Black’s speech, the Mayor got
a word in. “Mr. Black has forgotten to
mention,” said his Worship, “that these
premises were built by the City Council and
leased by the Government.” And if a per-
son named Cohenstein or something like that
had been there he might have got up and
said—“ And my Lord Mayor and the Chief
Secretary have both forgotten to mention that
I lent them the money for shop and trawlers
alike, and am going to have my little slice
out of every fish they catch and sell.”
Governor Strickland was another early
customer, and he sent his purchase to a hos-
pital, too. At his heels was General Finn,
in warlike array, dodging among the glitter-
ing pyramid of nanny gai, cucumber fish and
other scaly treasures. Frank Farnell, in the
offing, remarked .s otto voce that he wasn’t
taken seriously when he barracked for the
State getting into the fishmonger’s business
25 years ago. Mr. Stead, behind the counter,
jogged the memory of his official Chief in in-
formative asides, the Government orator hav-
ing lost his notes.
Since the opening, a roaring business has
been done, and another shop is to follow at
once at the Quay end of the city.
The first concert that new Conservatorium-
director Verbrugghen will hear in his terri-
tory will be the Symphony Orchestral affair
on August 28.
How lightheartedly the right young men
scamper off to the Front! General Finn’s
only son wrote that he “was delighted to be
going to the ball with so many of his friends.”
His bit of the great fireworks display is some-
where in Flanders.
The Australian infant is already inventing
new things to do for Allies’ Day. 'A. B. Pid-
digton’s youngster, aged nine, is the object
of fierce envy in juvenile society. He is giv-
ing a racehorse (think of it!) to the fund.
It is the gee-gee he won in an Australia Day
“art union.” A. B. Piddington is his Honor
of the. Inter-State Commission, and I suspect
the sinful raffle-tickets of the father are
passed on to the son. But, anyhow, the gift
has driven his youthful Sydney acquaintances
to schemes of terrific self-denial. One urchin
will give up eating butter (it has been rather
nasty since Auntie Sam’s efforts came this
way) if his distracted mother will reckon
how much money he can save by having jam
instead.
Young Merivale, the good-looking youth
who was so keen about polo in pre-war days,
has been killed at the Dardanelles. He was a
son of George Merivale, of Gibbs, Bright and
Co. Victor Meeks, only son of the firm’s A.
IV. Meeks, M.L.C., is on the way home on
sick furlough.
At Hurlstone, which is on the outer edge
of Ashfield, there is an Agricultural College ;
you can learn how to coax the surly pump-
kin and curl the barley’s beard within four
miles of Sydney G.P.O. It is a preparatory
school, and at the first call for a razor, off
the student is expected to pack to Hawkes-
bury or Wagga. The couple of hundred
rollicking youngsters in attendance had their
effort for Australia Day on Saturday. These
boys made a bazaar of it; held their sale
under the shadow of the silo; pasted the
bills themselves; did everything, in fact.
And there will he a plucky £lOO to hand over.
The Women’s Patriotic Association has a
housekeepers’ conference in view. This is
the first effort on the part of Woman to join
hands over the back fence and make a united
stand against waste in the commissariat.
Ulick Browne, the Queensland baritone, is
now employing his lung power to shout orders
as a machine-gun officer in a Welsh regi-
ment. Colonel Spencer Browne, who rode
away at the head of the Bananalanders’ light
horse, is of the same ancient family—lrish,
by the way, not Welsh.
Sydney yachtsmen no longer wait impati-
ently for the nor’-easter to blow the summer
season around. Commodore Alex. McCor-
mick, of the R.S.Y.S., is patching up break-
ages at the Front. Walter Marks is doing
blue-water patrol work in the North Sea.
Half the other skippers of the harbor’s mos-
quito fleet are in khaki. Amongst the
younger yachtsmen to fall in action was
Stewart Milson, of Kirribilli’s velvet lawns.
He was a grandson of the original Milson
of the Point, and a fine, strapping Austra-
lian.
Mrs. Herring, who used to be Florette
Murray Prior of these parts, is at present at
Hampstead. She followed hubby to Egypt,
but Baby Herring wilted there, so mamma
bundled off with her to England. Florette,
who had a pleasing voice in the years that
are dust, has been airing it again at patriotic
chansons in London.
Dean Talbot’s titian-haired bride, who fol-
lowed her husband to Cairo, went on to Eng-
land to stay with his belongings till the war
should cool off. But it still shows no sign
of cooling off, and Albert Edward Talbot has
been wounded in the Gallipoli antbed.
The laundries ought to offer a special song
of thanksgiving for the return of the white
petticoat. It’s just the same frilly nuisance
as of old, and calls for the tub as often as
ever.
Large contributions of dog are being offered
by enthusiastic owners to the sportsman’s
show in the Town Hall. Perhaps the
authorities will bind these animals over to
keep the peace better than they did at the
recent canine uproar in the Agricultural
Grounds. In any case, a lady weighing
anything over 12st. ought to be dissuaded
from attaching herself to a toy terrier so
long as her friend who is about one-third her
size is the only anchor to hold a mastiff or
bulldog. The affair is dated for September 4.
Lieut.-Col. Bob Owen, of a Bellambi
family, who has been wounded, was in the
British forces years ago. Then he retired
and took a military job in Maoriland for a
while. Later, he came back to his native
State, but buttoned on his war-coat again
when the Call came last year.
Vera Tasma, the handsome Hobart girl
who sang at the Tony Horderns’ patriotic
party the other evening, was a pupil of the
old Marchesi. The joyous soprano started
with the luck of attracting Melba’s
notice in 1909. After she had given
a successful account of herself at a
Royal Academy exam, in Hobart, examiner
Frederick Moore handed her a letter of
introduction to Australia’s skylark. Melba
was giving a few lessons to chosen favor-
ites in the Melbourne Conservatorium, and
pounced on the Tasmanian girl to add to her
pupils. Urging her protegee to go to Paris,
she next put her imperial hand to letters to
Marchesi and her special friend Madame
Sassoli. Vera had nearly four years’ study
with the veteran teacher, and had the unique
experience of being the quaint old lady’s
guest for part of the time. Evelyn Scotney, a
Melbourne soprano, was a fellow-pupil. After
putting a polish on her Italian by having
some lessons in Rome, Vera left Naples for
her native isle a few weeks before war
broke out. Her first teacher, Mrs. Emilie
Levy, gave the girl a contract to take over
her teaching connection in Hobart while
she had a year in Europe. That done,
the soprano came this way, and is likely to
stay here so long as the enemy is using his
torpedo and bayonet to vaccinate the babies
of Europe with his Kultur.
Pianist Yvonne Leverrier Charvin is
rounding up helpers for her concert on Octo-
ber 9. It’s a good date, for the country still
comes to town for race week. The proceeds
go to a Battalion Comforts Fund.
Artist Ruby Winckler writes from Boston
(U.S.A.) about a new publication for which
she did the illustrations: —
It’s to come out in the Pall without the very best
of my illustrations. This had to be left out because
Mrs. Vanderbilt’s little boy didn’t like it. His
mother is the authoress. I’d rather illustrate the
works of dead authors—they don’t give any trouble.
....The motif of another book I’m illustrating is
Peace —I’m dressing’ the Kaiser in a worried expres-
sion and a leopard-skin in one of the pictures....
The hot weather here outdoes anything we have in
Sydney, so I’m going to cool down for a week in
Maine... .The bathing here is dreadful after our Aus-
tralian beaches, and one has to be dressed up in
shoes, stockings, skirts, bloomers and goodness knows
what besides to satisfy the local notion of decorum.
Ruby’s illustrations in the Arabian Nights’
edition recently published in U.S. show the
gossamer work which we all admired when
exhibited in Sydney.
The long-haired Cherniavsky brothers, Leo,
Jan and Mischel, are going to fiddle their
way to Canada under the direction of Sol-
man. The trio leave Auckland for ’Frisco
this week. They’re booked for 74 appear-
ances in the Land of Salmon and Snow.
Thence they play a nine-months’ tour in
U.S.A. while Auntie Sam knits socks and dis-
cusses the strange ways of Wilhelm the
Pirate King.
What next, I wonder? This time it’s a
cake party in the Frank Davenports’ eyrie at
Darling Point on August 27 —for the usual
cause.
Persistent friends have pushed Mrs. Dan-
ger Owen away from her Red Cross stitches
for a few weeks. After 12 months’ strict
attention to socks and pyjamas the slender
bundle of energy tripped to Colombo in the
Morea.
Pretty Lizette Parkes, the one-time Baby
Parkes of Rickards shows, goes back to her
old haunt on the Hugh Mclntosh salary list.
Lizette is too Australian to make much head-
way against the swirl of foreign mediocrity
that floods the Australian stage.
City-alderman John Barlow’s only son has
fallen. A former Riverview College boy, he
represented the spirited type of Australian
who gives up everything to do his bit for Us.
Incidentally, also, to protect the shirkers who
bellow around football scrums. A host of
friends will sympathise with that energetic
committee woman* Mrs. Barlow, in her grief.
Miss D’Ebro, the tall ski-girl who cut such
a dashing figure at Kosciusko, has gone back
to Victoria. She got over the snow in the
sporting garb of the male creature. So she
can tell inquiring flappers what it feels like
to have no skirts banging round your ankles,
and as many pockets as you like.
Surgeon Charles MacLaurin, a brother of
the gallant Sydney man who was killed while
leading his men to a foothold in Gallipoli,
goes to the same address. Prince Alfred
Hospital loses a senior honorary it can ill
spare.
Having estimated the probable takings on
Violet Day at £2OO, the Savings Bank
people put two. youngsters on to the job of
counting the contents of the collectors’ boxes.
The youngsters were still counting and still
ejecting spurious coin at the end of last
week. About £2OOO is likely to be the total.
Some alien in our midst carefully dropped
a German mark into the good Australian
cash. But the loss is his. A collector
bought it, and good currency goes in its
place to the Soldiers’ Club.
Dr. Leslie Dunlop, an upstanding young
man who was in charge of Sydney Hospital
for a while, has been wounded in the head.
News came by last mail that he was then
on the exposed side of the Gallipoli hills,
tending the casualties at great risk. Ilis
brother, Dr. Albert Dunlop, was not far
away, but on the more sheltered slopes.
They’re sons of Dr. Dunlop, who used to be
well known in Queensland. He lately built
a home on the crags of Wollstonecraft.
A massage tea-party sounds misleading.
But no one did anything more strenuous than
farewell the lady kneaders at Farmer’s the
other afternoon. Miss Thomson, of Bur-
wood; Miss Lucy Rooke, of Hunter’s Hill;
Miss Yates and Miss Ivirkaldie —sister of a
nurse who has been at the Front for months
—were amongst those to whom good-byes
were said. In the middle of the entertain-
ment a breathless messenger arrived to say
that three more massage nurses were wanted
for service. So the company hurriedly took
stock to see whose kit-bags could be rushed
up the gangway in record time.
The Sydney Tech. College, which taught
Ruth Bannister the craft of wood carving,
has launched a sculptress on the world. Ruth
struck out for herself on original lines by
carving the stems of flowers as delicately as
hair-lines, and raised inches above the ground-
work. By chance (so she told me in the days
before she was famous, when she taught at
the dusty school at Ultimo), she followed
the trail blazed years ago by Grinling Gib-
bons. The lucky accident of having been
“discovered” by Lady Denman has kept her
chisel so busy in England that she has now
been ordered rest and country air.
Frances Quirk, the Australian girl who
had so many exhausting adventures in
Europe when war broke loose, is listening to
echoes of Italy’s great struggle from the peace-
ful shores of Lake Maggiore. Before pack-
ing up to leave Rome, Frances had an audi-
ence with the Pope—“a weary-looking, over-
worked prelate,” she says.
Orange has been sitting back to applaud
the efforts of its O.P. Society, which has
E. B. Dalton as president. The J.C.W.
people gave the society leave to put on “An
Englishman’s Home” for Australia Day
Fund, and the performance was entirely suc-
cessful.
Nelson Illingworth’s song recitals in the
Repertory are for the bandaged kangaroo.
They begin on September 8.
lan Maclaren, the imported “lead” wdio
made his first appearance here the other
week, is greatly daring. Not only does lie
shatter the illusions of the matinee girl bv
mentioning a daughter, but I fancy he caii
produce her at once if there’s any doubt about
the matter.
The full petticoat is the latest device to
force the thrifty woman into wider skirts.
We all remember this frilly nuisance as it
was four or five years ago. Now it comes
back in the old, hard, machine-gun crackle
of glace silk —an aggressive undergarment
which compels your attention. There seems
to be about five yards of it round the hem,
and Heaven knows how many ells in finely-
pleated kilted flounces.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.
Has anyone noticed that the most windy
objectors to “contentious legislation while
the war is on” are heated advocates of the
earlier closing of pubs? Putting merits
aside, is anyone prepared to call that propo-
sition non-contentious?

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, August 23, 1915.
My Dear Yarrie, —
Saturday s horse-racing at Flemington
was haunted by soldiers in the making—
young, keen-faced men in shapeless dun-
gaiees who looked on free of charge, because
they were camped on the grassy premises.
1 heir kitchens are perched on the Hill; but
they stopped the absorbing business of cook-
ing at intervals when the excited roars of
stay-at-homes warned them of an interest-
ing finish. The expeditionaries who were
not on duty had a good time among the
crowd. And if their presence didn’t make
S ?V 3e T °f our racin £ young men uncomfort-
able I don’t know what will. Some of them
hid tlieir working “blues” under regulation
khaki, overcoats, and wore woollen scarves
gracefully festooned round their necks.
Recruits are now so numerous that only the
luckiest have complete outfits.
The G.-G. was present as a matter of
pleasure in an ordinary sac suit and over-
coat. He missed a great chance by not
appearing in the fashionable blue fatigue
dress. Doris Blackwood and her friend Miss
Mandeville swam alongside his Ex., and a
couple of faithful Genthelps bounded and
barked at their heels. Our G.-G. is becom-
ing a real sport; for this Flemington meet-
ing was not a social outing.
With Marshall Hall dead, it seemed in-
evitable that Willie Laver should become
1 rofessor of Music at Melb. University.
Laver was vice-director under the late im-
ported Peterson, and after Peterson’s death
ran the show until Marshall Hall was
brought back from his exile in Europe. He
being now as dead as Peterson, there was
much talk of importing a third stranger.
This, however, blew out. The choice then
lay between Laver and Fritz Hart, who not
so long ago took charge of the other Con-
servatorium which Hall had established
when he lost his original billet. Laver got
the preference as a matter of course. He
carries more ballast, and he had the old
associations to recommend him. Laver got
his professorial grounding in Germany; he
went to Frankfort as a youth, and stayed
there seven years. But for the rest of 'his
life he has been Australian—and his brother
Frank was an Australian Eleven star. A
Frenchman or an Italian could have given
a new turn to musical thought in Melbourne,
but this was hardly the right time to get a
suitable man from either sphere. Laver will
do very well—if he remembers that in this
sunny land the soul of music looks for ex-
pression outside the solemn, solid master-
pieces of Wagner, Beethoven and Bach.
Tragedy followed close upon last week’s
inaugural meeting of the Soldiers’ Wives’
Union in Melbourne. The gathering had
chosen Mrs. Alec White and Dr. Downes’s
wife as its joint secretaries. Within a few
hours Mrs. White learned that her soldier
was missing; and, almost immediately, the
further news came that he had been killed.
Lieutenant-Colonel of'the Sth Light Horse.
White had been wounded in a previous
action, made a satisfactory recovery, and
was only back among the shrapnel for a
short period before he met his death.
Pleasant news has come to Mrs. Rupert
Downes, who is keeping the home together
at South Yarra in the absence of her lieu-
tenant-colonel at the Front. Dr. Downes,
after spending a warm three months with
the Third Light Horse Field-Ambulance in
the thick of the fighting, has temporarily
knocked off work on the Peninsula to carry
bricks at comparatively peaceful Lemnos,
where several hundred war-scarred patients
are striving to regain their feet.
Lady Helen Ferguson lately expressed sur-
prise at the sort of requisitions coming to
hand from Australian soldiers. An appeal
for "more billycans” completely baffled her.
“What are billycans?” she asked. When
nine people started to explain she looked more
puzzled than ever. But when somebody re-
called Lawson’s “While the Billy Boils” she
began to smell tea, and further explanation
was unnecessary.
The G.-G. and his lady went to hear the
Belgian Band at the Auditorium on Satur-
day night, and sat entranced in the balcony
from overture to Anthem. Our vice-regal
head —or rather the silver hair that adorns
it—has been clipped short in the prevailing
military fashion. What was lately a mass
of curls is now like a toothbrush. Isn’t war
terrible? Her Ex. had her black hair done
in a simple knot. Miss Mandeville wore
very pink cheeks and a coat with intense
blue drapings. A half-moon of diamonds
glittered in her hair. Aide Foxton seemed
to sway like a charmed serpent as lie lis-
tened to the Band playing waltzes. The
Belgians are a cheerful crowd with an im-
mense repertoire—two pages of close type
filled with numbered items, some of which
are as long as a Melbourne street. Meny
and his men are specialists in ballet music.
D&libe’s stuff gets a musical airing that makes
the local pundits’ eyes sparkle. Goossens,
the- young baritone, is rather colorless alone,
but tones up harmoniously when duetting
with soprano Alice ATceroy. This lady has
a loveable voice, and was prima donna at
the principal Belgian opera house before the
Hogs rushed in. On Saturday she was
draped in white satin, gold panniers and
silver lace. Of course, she had to live up to
her background of bright paddy green-uni-
form with scarlet frogs and buff curtain with
pink roses. The first violinist is serious to
an alarming degree; he has a long, high
head surmounted fcy grassy tufts of bristling
hair, and his eyes glare feverishly behind
powerful spectacles. His name is Florent
Hoogstoel—which is enough to trouble any
man.
South Aus. has had two big losses this
week: Rowell and Miell, both light-horse
colonels, are reported dead almost simul-
taneously. Both had their first training
against the Boers ; both returned to S. Aus-
tralia and the land. Rowell went fruit-
farming ; Miell was a northern wheat-grower
and a keen soldier of the muscular-Christian
type.
Apropos the marriage of Australia’s
sombre, visitor, the Rajah of Pudakota, to an
attractive Melbourne girl, whose mother and
sister will accompany the pair “abroad.”
Evidently there are great things doing at
home. The Asian (Calcutta), of Julv 24,
had this advt.:—
WANTED.
A .Landscape Gardener with practical experience is
required to lay out and maintain a compound of
about 100 acres for His Highness the Rajah of
Pudukkotta, G.C.1.E., at Pudukkotta.
Apply with testimonials and references to the
Darbar, Pudukkotta, Trichinopoly.
Still, the girl says she’s not going to live in
India.
Last week Alec. Forrest, nephew of
Bigjohn, entered into life partnership with
Miss Pearl Smith, lately playing “Dad”
Bailey’s, daughter in “On Our Selection.”
The tieing-up was so quiet that it seemed
like an outrage not to have done the job in
the deaf and dumb alphabet.
Major Loch and his wife are settled down
in loorak for a spell. The Major is a cousin
of the bearded Sir Henry, who ruled
this State, when your Johanna wore pina-
fores, and is here on a horse-buying mission.
Rupert Clarke lias been sending portraits
of himself in khaki to friends and relations
at this end. The portraits came from Eng-
land., but the original is now supposed to be
carting food for men and guns in France,
with the Army Service Corps, in which he
holds the rank of lieutenant.
Lady Northcote has taken some wounded
Australians and. Canadians to convalesce in
her lovely home in Kent. One of the boys
is “Moppy” McCubbin, who is anxiously
watching the results of expert massage on his
lame ankle, and hopes to be able to walk
again. The comfort and luxury provided by
the hospitable Northcote dame are described
by the letter-writers in superlatives.
After an eventful eight weeks of Turk-
potting Lieutenant J. M. Mathew, eldest son
of bushman-parson John Mathew, of Coburg,
has been bowled over with typhoid, and now
lies at Malta, “progressing satisfactorily.”
Young Mathew is a mining engineer, and
has had nearly as much Outback experience
as his father. He will probably be sent to
England for an autumn convalescence.
The supplying of rabbit-skin vests, to be
worn under the service tunic, has been one
of the chief jobs of the patriotic league
which is bossed by David Hennessy’s dame.
Beatrice Henty is at present handling the
league’s letters, and these include a recent
one from Admiral Patey, giving three cheers
for the rabbit-garment as being highly suit-
able for North Sea wear. Twelve rabbits
die to warm one sailor.
Black-and-white artist George Benson, who
went away from Melbourne with the First
Expeditionaries, writes that before the Aus-
tralian troops wore sent to Oallipoli, lie was
packed over to the Queen (presumably this
is the Queen Elizabeth) dressed as a ser-
geant of marines, the object being to give no
hint that Australians were coming along.
4\ hilst on the battleship Benson made
sketches of the coast for the use of the
officers who were to conduct the landing. His
letter has many amusing thumb-nail sketches,
including one of Philip Schuler, the Age
man, interviewing a wounded soldier in bed,
getting what Benson describes as “Next-to-
Dead-Men’s Tales.”
The executive committee of a certain
patriotic organisation nearly had a series of
brilliant fits on reading the report from its
most willing worker. He accused the mem-
bers of being a useless lot who appeared to
be there for decorative rather than useful
purposes. Then, tired of shouldering other
people’s burdens as well as his own, he
attached his resignation. The sort of
patriot he was tired of flies to pieces
directly a little advertisement has been wmn
They generally mean well, but thev have
no staying power. The “patriotism” of
that type is a fire of straw quickly burnt
out.
Young Grantham Anderson, a Melbourne
“Scotch” boy, has made a better-than-usual
name for himself in the R.A.M.C. in France.
He dropped private practice to go Red Cross-
ing at the very beginning of things.
Aubrey Officer, of the ostrich farm, has
left Kerang with blood in the eye for Turkey.
Brother Geoff., who started out two months
'ahead, struck trouble early, being badly
shrapnelled in the head. It’s a small world,
after all; for when Geoffy stepped into his
first trench he found himself beside a neigh-
boring farmer who had left here with the
second contingent.
Dr. Sandison Yule, who has joined the
army of surgeons on war-service, is a son
of Alexander Yule, that gentle old shep-
herd of Presbyterian souls who for so many
years ministered to a perfectly harmless con-
gregation at College Church, on the fringe
of the Melbourne University grounds, and
never once preached Ilell-fire during the
whole of his career. The Yules, father,
mother and three sons, were imported from
Aberdeen, decades agone, in the days when
even the smaller Presbyterian churches
couldn’t bear “sitting under” a mere Aus-
tralian ; and the importers’ plate-silver
proved to be plentiful enough to give each
of the three bairns a profession after his
own heart. The surgeon-laddie is the
eldest.
Latest dispatches from Adelaide: —
The wounded soldiers got their first taste of an
official welcome on Friday when they were motored
to the Exhibition and lunched by the Cheer-Up
Society. President Sowden was in the chair, and
the inescapable speeches were supplied by Premiers
and ex-Premiers and Colonels and Mayors. The
Cheer-Up girls, garbed in white, did the waiting,
and the hungry public smacked its lips in the
galleries.
The Mayor’s Patriotic Concert has been post-
poned to September 9, so that it may fit in with the
visit of the Munro-Fergusons, who arrive just in
time for Wattle Day.
Collier Cudmore has got a commission in the
Royal Field Artillery, in which noisy corps his
brother has been perspiring since January. Also,
the Ronald Angases have packed their trunks. He
has his eye on a motoring job at one of the Fronts.
The Victoria League runs a half-crown entertain-
ment for the Red Cross Funds at Austral Gardens
on Tuesday afternoon. A lecture by Lady Galway
on Constantinople is the chief bait. Clara Serena
is making arrangements for a patriotic concert at
the Town Hall, and there is to be a French day on
September 9.
Mr. W. B. Wilkinson has been made president
of the Commonwealth Club, in place of the late John
Downer. Which reminds me that the Fred Downers
are off to England for a year or so.
Thank Heaven, butter has suddenly dropped six-
pence a pound, and it is again possible to dash
lumps of it on hot toast without being madly ex-
travagant.
Died in the North Adelaide hospital on Thurs-
day, Major E. Feuerheerdt, of Crowar station, near
Lucindale, a man well known in the south-east as
a sheep-breeder and an Adam Lindsay Gordon
devotee. He volunteered for service some time ago,
and was offered command of a transport. But
when the offer came he was too ill to accept.
News has come through, this week, of the death of
Sergeant Leslie Gordon, son of the late James Gordon,
S.M., and himself a well-known lawyer. He had a
brilliant university career, and used to be in part-
nership with the late J. R. Anderson, K.C. His bro-
ther, Kenneth, who was also at the Dardanelles, has
for some time been “missing.”
Capt. Chabrel, also gone, was a son of an old
Indian civil servant. He was a St. Peter’s boy, who
entered the Military Staff College at Duntroon as a
cadet in 1912, and remained there till he reported
for service last October. He was second in his year
at Duntroon, and promised to make an excellent
officer. Two of his brothers are at the Front—both
as privates.
James Banks, of Dalgety and Co., is a poet of the
simple, direct, bush kind. He has published a song,
“To You,” dedicated to two young Bankses now in
the Dardanelles, and has made a big difference to
the S.E. end of the Red Cross Fund, which takes
the proceeds. “To You” is about the wattle and
the cattle track and the curlew and the girl; and
its musical setting is bright and tuneful.
Yon Goes, Consul-General for Sweden,
came over to Melbourne the other day,
apparently to decorate Pastor Iluttman with
some bauble conferred by the King of
Sweden. The little present from Gustav V.
was the Yasa order, and all the local turnips
went stolidly to the Swedish Church, which
is amongst the wilderness of factories on
the South Melbourne part of the Yarra bank.
Mrs. Jansen fixed up a musical programme,
and the audience congregated solemnly in
pews to listen. The scene reminded me of
a word-picture from an Ibsen novel —relieved
by a carefully screened-off array of bottles
and things in the vestry.
After producing four dozen repertory plays
for highbrows in years, Gregan McMahon
contracted Suppressed Ibsenitis or something
that can only be cured by rest, and lias been
ordered a long holiday. During his vaca-
tion _ the Club will go on with its patriotic
parties, but the theatre is out of commis-
sion for three months.
Pink and hearty Methodist-parson Sugden,
master of Queen’s, at Melbourne Uni., was
one of the most important features at the
Australian Methodist centenary celebrations
last week. He waved an agitated stick at
an enormous choir in the Town Hall, and
had _ a thoroughly good time. Sugden is a
’cellist, and his house is simply crammed with
talent. One daughter was musically-educated
at the Albert-street conservatorium, and
another went later to study the fiddle at the
Uni. Papa is a press critic of cruiser ton-
nage ; but his decisions are usually couched
in polite language and have never yet caused
a riot.
The Stuart Murrays are off to England.
Stuart is one of a firm which requires a
partner in Fogland, and he is going to be
that • partner. His wife is saying her fare-
wells in fetching black ; the outfit looks like
widow’s weeds, but isn’t. She is a good
amateur operatic singer, and will be on the
programme at the patriotic concert at Clive-
den on Thursday.
Minnie Love, just back from the Maori-
land tour of the “Cinderella” panto., has
followed the footlights fashion of parting
from her appendix. She is bearing the separ-
ation bravely in an East Melbourne private
hospital.
“Whither?” the three-act play written by
Mary Wilkinson, which was staged here a
while back by the Repertory people, is to be
produced by Miss Hornimann’s company at
the Manchester Repertory Theatre ; which, I
understand, is considered quite The Thing
in a literary manner of speaking. Miss Wil-
kinson, who plays a typewriter for Dalgety’s,
is naturally elated.
All sorts of tragedies in this war! A
Melbourne miss with money wanted to marry
a uniform. Her lad was only a student, not
a soldier, and the young man wished to finish
his medical course before enlisting. The girl
preferred to get her recruit at once ; but the
student reckoned he would be of more value
at the Front as a full-fledged surgeon than
as a fifth-year student, so everything was
“off.” Then the girl married Another,
who was already signed on for active service
and had no exams, to pass. Then the exams,
were pushed on, and the student finished his
task and enlisted. Now both youths are in
training at the same camp, and what might
have been isn’t.
King Edward’s Horse, which has one
reserve squadron in England and three
squadrons at the Front, is shortly to be
strengthened by the addition of that kindly-
uatured young man, Lauchlan Mackinnon.
All openings in the “home” squadron of
King Edward’s Horse are kept for “colo-
nials,” and the regiment is a favored medium
for turning out C.O.’s from raw overseas
material. Young Mackinnon’s customary
place is in the Akgus office, helping Lauch-
lan the Elder to general-manage the paper,
and drawing dividends from it in his spare
time.
Kreisler, the eminent fiddler who has been
shouldering a gun for Franz Josef in Galicia,
has found his musical ear immensely useful in
“determining the exact spot where an enemy
shell reached its acme of distance.” In his
just-published book, “Four Weeks in the
Trenches,” he tells all about it :: —
I recounted my discovery to an artillery officer
who thought that it would be of great value in a
case where the position of the opposing battery was
hidden, and thus could bo located. He apparently
spoke to his commander about me, for a few days
later I was sent out on a reconnoitring tour with
the object of marking on the map the exact spot
where I thought the hostile shells were reaching their
acme, and it was later on reported to me that I had
succeeded in giving to our batteries the almost exact
range of the Russian guns.
It is a very likely story, for you have only to
take the square of the distance between
Kreisler’s spot on the map and the landing
place of the shell, and divide by the cube
root of the trajectory, to obtain the exact
position of the enemy gun. If you’re too
busy, dear, just send the sum on to me. I’ve
got my 10 fingers left.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

‘ Bung”: Mention of sheep-droving per
motor reminds me of a performance of the late
Andrew Badgery, on his Cogenburgh station, near
Bungonia (N.S.W.). The station stockmen, headed
by Charley Muffett, a noted roughrider of the
time, were endeavoring to yard a mob of brumbies
from the Gundary ranges. Their horses were pretty
web blown, and the scrubbers were winning a
break-neck race for the wrong end of the wing fence,
when Badgery slewed his carriage and pair from the
road, and charged into the flutter. The paddock
was littered with logs and stumps, and there
were many collisions and wild jolts during the mad
tear-away, but the scrub wildings wheeled from the
dash and clatter coming in on their flank and were
yarded. I doubt if the mob was worth the wreck-
age.
* * * *
“Moana”: How’s this for a record? In
Southland (M.L.) the other day a farmer named
Cullen killed on his farm at Morton Mains a prime
nine-months-old pure-bred Leicester ewe lamb. When
dressed it turned the scales at 1181 b.
AN HER EDIT ARY COMPLAINT.
THE TEACHER: “Thompson, in the transla-
tion of your exercise there are words
missing in every sentence.”
ANOTHER BOY: “Please, sir, Thompson's
father’s the censor.”
“T.F.”: Sharks —who is on their visit-
ing list? Engineer Walker, of the Douglas Maw-
son, introduces them by hauling in a choice speci-
men off Trial Bay (N.S.AV.). The tape certified that
when standing erect it measured 21ft. The jaws of
the hungry brother were 2ft. across. Any bigger
than that ever landed in Australia?
THE ALIEN IN OUR MIDST.
BEERY PATRIOT: “Yer Weedin’ square’ead, ye’ve been singin' ’Och der Kaiser.’"
HATED FOREIGNER : “I aind't.”
B.P.: “Ye’ve been singin' ‘Gor’ Save the King,’ then, yer lyin’ ’ound!"
H.F.: “Nod at dall!"
B.P.: “Yer ain’t been singin' nothin’, then?”
H.F.: “Nettings.”
B.P.: I knew yer was one o' those silent sneaks. Take that, yer broodin’ Hun!”
“Clinker”: I hate to contradict a lady,
but “Biddy B.’s” par re kurrajong (B. 15/7/’l5)
is so far over the odds that I must. The statement
that a kurrajong will stand lopping three times in
IS months is a staggerer. It is a matter of common
knowledge that while the vegetable is benefited by
an occasional lopping, it requires from three to
four years to recover enough vitality to bear lopping
again. A method sometimes followed, not only on
kurrajong, but also boree and other edible trees, is
to flog the leaves off with a piece of wire. This is
not so easy as lopping, but it is not so severe ,on
the tree, and therefore can be done oftener. If
“Biddy B.” has lopped her trees as she says, I am
offering liberal odds that the majority of them are
as surely killed as if they had boen ving’burked.
Which, seeing that she appraises them at correct
value, is a pity.
“Pick” : There was nothing extraordinary
in “Axehandle’s” mates at Iviandra (N.S.W.) finding
their lost steed standing dead. In wet or cold, horses
invariably sleep standing, and a strong horse perish-
ing from exposure in that snowy region would rigidly
prop his stiffening limbs and keep his equilibrium to
the last. Dying without a struggle, as frozen
animals do, he would in all probability remain on
his legs until time or dingoes brought him down. At
Kiandra I have seen a whole hillside dotted with the
corpses of frozen sheep. They all retained the
appearance of sleeping animals.
“Clip” : “Wodji,” who leaped at “G.J.11.”
(B. 29/7/T5), landed in a heap. When he says
that even a small F.N. vest-pocket automatic pistol
kicks like a show buckjumper, I suspect that he
has gained his experience by viewing the weapon
through a shop window. I have used a .32 cal.
police model F.N., also the .32 cal. new model of
the same make, both of them for a considerable
time, and have found no recoil or tendency to
jump with either implement. The automatic is a
pleasure to use after the ordinary revolver. I have
never found the automatic jamb if properly cleaned
and oiled. Probably the lubricant “Wodji” uses
is not suitable for automatic pistols, which would
account for the way in which he alleges the gun
behaves, especially in the hands of a novice. Regard-
ing his remarks about an involuntary clutch to
stop the weapon jumping out of the hand, and so
firing another shot, all I can suggest is that he
might try a few lessons in the art of holding a
pistol.
“F.11.D.”: The station manager was
riding round the run, when he was overtaken by a
flash blackfellow who had a few days before been
put on to a job. Galloping up behind the boss
he gave him a hearty smack on the back, at the
same time remarking, “G’ day, Bob, ole fella. How
you bin gotten on?” The boss’s reply to the cor-
dial greeting was a punch on the nose that sent
Jimmy flying. A few days later the boss’s maiden
aunt, driving in to pay her nephew a visit, en-
countered Jimmy and asked, “Where Bob walk
about?” With a look of awe on his Belgiumed
face Jimmy said in a confidential undertone: “By
eripe, don’ you callem Bob. First time him
knock cm h out of you!”
AFFECTING HIS HONOR.
Mk. KIDSTAKES (to tired victim, who is just
preparing to escape): “I say, ole boy;
I can't sponge on you all day, you know.
Y ou must really lend me a sovereign, or
I positively shan’t let you ‘shout’ me
any more!”
aiTe ” : A layer of sawdust in a truck
is a good investment when loading weak horses or
cattle foi a long' railway journey. I have seen the
poorest animals taken hundreds of miles without loss,
when others in fair nick without this safeguard were
slipping and falling all over the enclosure and break-
ing things.

WHEN THE GIRLS BRING OUT THE TEA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
11l the clear September mornings when the sunshine
lit the dew,
And the wheat-lark carolled madly in a world of
green and blue,
Twas pleasant to be working, if you’d call it work
at all,
When the binder ran like music, and the crop was
clean and tall;
When the tireless fans turned slowly where the
stricken wheat-stalks swayed,
To the song of flying canvas and the rhyme of raeiuo-
blade.
Tet the joys of mowing mornings could never seem
to me
As the joys that came with evening when the girls
brought out the tea.
We'd see them coming slowly, with high lift of
little, feet—-
For they’d learned that in September there are grass-
seeds ’mid the wheat—•
With the burnished billy shining like a diamond in
the sun,
And their laughter sent before them as the herald
of their fun ;
’Moi g the farmer’s merry daughters, with faces
frank and brown,
We'd sometimes note a stranger with the pallor of
the town ;
I Cihaps a town-bred cousin, or a city friend, maybe,
Who d been asked to join in the revels when the
girls brought out the tea.
Oh, those banquets in the hayfields! They could
boast no fancj r wines ;
But we gladly dropped the pitchforks and we gaily
left the lines,
And came with haste and laughter and a thirst more
fresh and keen
Than e’er felt gilded diner for his loaded board, I
ween.
Hot cakes and black tea steaming, and, to make the
feast complete,
Just the girl you’d choose beside you with a hay-
sheaf for a scat.
And I'll say this for the hay-sheaf, for I’ve often
proved it true,
Though for one ’tis splendid seating, ’tis a better
nest for two.
Then the tea ebbed low and lower, while the sun
sank in the skies,
And the girls joined in the laughter with the sun-
shine in their eyes ;
Ah, the black tea seemed like nectar, for the which
high gods might pine,
Or Bacchus leave his vineyard, and the cakes seemed
food divine.
And the girls they were the sweetest that ever
loved to play,
For girls, like tea and “cookies,” grow sweeter ’mid
the hay.
And the sun ne’er kissed a jollier, nor dearer maid,
to me.
than the gill that shared my hav-sheaf and my
pannikin of tea.
Oh, the farmers envy no man as they wander blithely
round,
With reverent step and raptured, as of men on
holy ground,
M hen on their whispering wheatfields the golden sun-
shine glows,
M hen their tall stooks throng the hay-lands in trim
and crowded rows.
Ai hen they hear the clink of guineas in the song the
binders sing,
There are few among the farmers would change places
with a king;
But the richest man among them was a poorer man
than me
When I saw the white sun-bonnets of the girls that
brought the tea.

Eddyson : “I’ve told yeh manny’s the
time iv the uproarious blood feud iv the Grogans V
the Hogans. The same Hogan shtopped his father’s
funeral t’ fight a Farin', tearin’ battle wid Crogan,
’n’ was carried on ’n’ home in the hearse, bein’ too
sore throubled t’ walk fer a week afther.” Flynn
swirled the whisky in his glass, and then threw it
down his throat for the lack of a sink. “There was
a full score of noble ’n’ heroic contests bechune
Grogan ’n’ Hogan afther that, but the quarest iv
anny was the fight iv giants in the tunnel runs into
the hill be the crick et the fut iv Danny Clarke’s
home paddock, the same paddock Walther Hogan
was clearin’ iv the great rocks bestlirew it thick ez
curran s in a duff. There’s a terrible heavy rain-slitorm
come up while Walther be wor-rkin’, ’n’ the good
man ran t’ the tunnel fer shelter, ’n’ butt fair into
James Grogan is before him. “ ‘ ’Tis like a Hogan,’
sez Grogan. ‘Pitiful like a Hogan ’tis,’ sez he, ‘t’
be ever inthrudin on the quiet ’n’ privacy iv gintle-

a gintlemin?’ sez Hogan. ‘The Crogans I’m mis-
iortunit enough t’ be acquaint wid,’ sez he, ‘are pigs
to a man, n hogs at that,’ he sez. ‘Ar-gyment is
waste on yeh,’ sez Crogan, ’n’ forthwith delivers a
palthog on the ear iv Hogan. Hogan rips wid the
left, ’n' crosses the right t’ the jaw. ‘Wid them is
lackin’ in common dacency ’n’ the understandin' iv
Christians,’ sez he, ‘intelligent converse is out iv the
question." Crogan plugs his orathory wid a shtraight
left, ’n’ Ilogan parts wid the on’y tooth left over
frim the rare fight et his father’s funeral. There’s
not further remar-rks iv anny inthrest, Hogan bein’
too busy, ’n’ Crogan actively engaged wid matters iv
greater consarn. ’Tis an illigant scrap they have all
be their alone in the dar-rk tunnel, ’n’ how ’twould
have end itsilf the Lor-rd knows, but afther 10
minutes iv solid shloggin’ there’s a sudden ’n’
unan’mous cessation iv hostilities follyin’ on a natural
upheaval ’if a visitation iv Providence. The tunnel
have gone pitch dar-rk wid a treminjis roarin’ ’n’

exit fer Hogan ’n’ Crogan, the mouth iv the tunnel
bein' shtopped impenethrable, ’n’ James Crogan ’n’
Walther Hogan is pris’ners iv war-r. Mercy on their

past Hogan ’n’ others have been shtakin’ the millions
iv solid rocks the size iv a pig on the forelie id iv

a rubble wall the length iv his land. The rain is

rare live chance iv d.vin iv breathlessness ’n’ gineral
star-vation. Fer a han’ful iv minutes there’s nothin’

‘Walther Hogan, we’re dead men!’ ‘Dead V done

time in lnsthory a Hogan have agreed wid a Crogan.

sez Crogan. ‘Amen!’ sez he. ‘James Crogan,’ sez
Hogan, ‘we’re like t’ be iiar-rd done bj 7 , ’n’ the end

Crogan. ‘The time is ripe,’ sez he, ‘fer an offensive
’n’ defensive alliance bechune the Grogans ’n’ the

Grogan’s hand in the dar-rk, ’n’ they shook war-rmly.
‘Sincere is me wish ye’ll come out iv this alive,’ sez
Ilogan. ‘Same t’ yersilf, Walther, ’n’ manny of

THE GENTLE HINT.
WIDOW: "Do you know, you naughty man, that my daughter has set eyes upon you?”
VICTIM (flattered): “Has she, really?”
WIDOW: “She has, indeed! Only to-day she was saying, ‘That's the sort of gentleman
should like for my pa?”
“Horse Sense”: There is an old horse
that grazes about a Queensland bore-head, and, when
thirsty, sucks up artesian water which is far too
hot to plunge a toil-hardened hand into. He has
been doing it for years now, and has a tongue like
a motor-tyre. His boss swears the old nag started
taking an early-morning nip of hot water for his
indigestion.
“Rag” : If anybody wants the address of
the least-watered part of Australia, he can have
the Esperance-Albany and up to Norseman (W.A.)
trail. What little surface water there is—generally
in a ti-tree swamp —is invariably supersaturated with
tannin or other poison from reeds or dead vegeta-
tion. The only water fit to drink without previous
boiling is found in granite holes. The blacks there-
about are very nomadic. We found many of theii
wells away in the middle of dense mallee thickets.
Presumably the mallee, like the kurrajong, is a
reliable indicator that moisture is obtainable there-
about. Most of the wells were lined with stones,
and filled in with various detritus. In a dry spell
the ’roos used to dig in the mallee for a drink.
Strange to say, these good Australians are bigger
and more numerous along the Esperance-Albany coast
than I’ve seen anywhere else.

“Goody”: Maps of YVestralia show vast
lakes extending across the north Coolgardie desert,
but at most times one may walk over any of them
without damping one’s boots. For hundreds of
square miles Lake Barlee resembles nothing so much
as a great, level snow-field, so encrusted is it with
magnesia, gypsum and salt. At Lake Way, to be
sure, there is, or was, a sailing club, blit the boats
are—or were—planks mounted on bike-wheels and
carrying a sail the size of that used on a 10ft.
dinghy. To find water about 3ft. of fine chocolate
alluvium has to be dug through; and when reached
the liquid is super-saturated with salts. Much con-
densation is necessary before it is fit even for stock
to drink, and to use it with whisky would be a scan-
dalous waste.

“Boonn Blue” : Rc kurrajong and “Biddy
R.” (B. 15/7/’15). In Condoblin district (N.S.W.)
during the drought just broken we started to lop
about June, 1914, for 2000 sheep. (“Biddy” lopped
six months earlier.) In December, although drought
was at its limit all the time, we lopped (he same
trees (“Biddy” also lopped in December; so we
beat her by six months). This month the trees are
ready, if occasion required, to lop again. Our
horses have done well on this feed, including the
branches, and, for “Biddy’s” information, we have
found it quite safe for them to remain on the diet
for five or six months.
* * * *
Rutherglen”: Re the much-discussed
drought, a few observations in regard to the recovery
of pasture. Anyone who watched the grass paddocks
eaten down by the stock could not have missed being
impressed by the absolute bareness of the ground in
the summer and early autumn months of this year,
and have wondered how it was
going to revive. In March the fallow
and pasture land was bare, while
the grazing land in timbered pad-
docks differed only in possessing a
few sheltered grass-stumps; scarred
and lifeless. The quantity of
grass seed produced last ‘ year
must have been exceedingly small
on account of the dry conditions
and the close feeding. AVhcn the
rain came in May it was warm,
steady and prolonged, but weeks
passed and stock couldn't get a
bite of new grass. Yet the crops
came up even and vigorous, show-
ing that conditions were favorable
for germination. In .fact, seed
sown in June took no longer to
germinate than that sown in April
or May. The grass, however,
wouldn’t “come.” Why? It
seems to me that, apart from the
fact that the perennial grasses
suffered from close feeding, the
reason for the tantalising slow
growth was that the seed was
buried at varying depths, and none
of it was on the surface, and
most of it was more than a year
old. In a normal year there is
always a layer of dead grass and
decayed organic matter covering
the pasture-land in which the
recently-shed seed is lying ready
to spring into growth with the
first rain. We know that new
seed germinates more quickly and
better than old, and that grass
seeds require shallow planting.
In addition, the temperature may
have had an appreciable effect.
Though conditions throughout
May and June were favorable for
quick and frosts
were rare, the daily temperature
seldom rose above 60deg.—in
north-eastern Victoria, at any
rate.
“Sarto”: The best burning and heating
wood I’ve ever used is white-box. The other boxes
—red and yellow—are good, but not in it with
white brother, although I’ve known a yellow box
log burn throughout a week of incessant rain.
Stringy-bark is almost as bad as the dead finish, and
the dead finish is, without a doubt, apple-tree. It
wouldn’t burn even if it had a chance to fry the
Kaiser. I’ll say this for stringy—it makes the best
charcoal.
“O’MeK.”: In this wood-for-fuel argu-
ment all hands seem to have forgotten boree. Out
here (south-west N.S.W.), whei-e we have a fail-
variety to choose from, boree is ' easily first favorite.
It is especially esteemed by- the average Mrs. Wheat-
ear. Burning it over-night she is sure of a nice bed
of glowing coals to greet her on a frosty morning,
and its ashes are a splendid substitute for whiting in
cleaning- up the domestic hearth when the roads are
heavy and grocery supplies run out.
“Hitasun”: If the wrangle anent the
length of roots is not confined to Australia, I’ll
blow “Boronia” and his 104 ft. tentacle (B. 29/7/T5)
off the platform. On the word of the Chief of
Irrigation Inquiry,
U.S., roots of alfalfa
(lucerne) have pene-
trated through the
crevices into a tunnel
129 ft. below the field.
They may be expected
at Gape York any day.

THE WATER-WAGGONER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. Alderman Jaggs, a convivial man,
Was chief of the Dingoville flag-waving clan;
The hottest of patriots, fervid and true,
For the Empire there’s nothing that Jaggs wouldn’t
do.
He’d spout half the night,
Or get loyally tight
With toasting “The Flag!” in a favorite brew.
He brayed: “There's no sacrifice I wouldn’t make
For the dear Motherland when her freedom’s at
stake!”
Then a wowser named Binks had this cynical fling-:
“To saci-ifice boose is the popular thing!”
Jaggs thought it absurd,
But he stuck to his word,
And he publicly swore that he’d follow the King.
All Dingoville gasped at the wonderful news,
But they crowded to hear him deliver his views.
Yea, the speeches by Jaggs, as a High Rechabite,
Drew “standing room only” each Saturday night.
For he stormed, and exhoi-ted,
And danced, and cavorted—
As a comedy turn he was more than all right.
Bxit perched oxi his pedestal Jaggs lost his head,
Though not his reganl for the dope that is red !
To keep up his nerve as a temperance star
He frequently sampled a corpulent jar
Which he kept on the sly,
And when no one was by
lie sozzled in secret at Sullivan’s bar!
He’d taken the chair at the meeting one night,
When he challenged the whole congregation to fight,
And he started “Gorsave!” in a bibulous roar,
As the scandalised Rechabites broke for the door,
And he uppercut Binks,
Tried to shake him for drinks,
Then sobbed and collapsed in a heap on the floor!
Far from Dingoville, Jaggs now resides at Cow Flat,
And has pasted these virtuous rules in his hat:
“When you’ve published the news that you’re travel-
ling dry,
Never sample a tid. if a wowser is by.”
And this, above all:
“To prevent a bad fall,
When you ride on a water-cart, don’t perch too
high!”
QUEENSLAND.
NORMAN CAMPBELL.
Randolph Bedford’s yarn:—-
Jim Webb, of W.A., writes from Heliopolis; and
it was through reading his lettei-s we went out to
see Jim Nolan, known on a dozen mining fields, who
has a wild Irish-Australian nephew at the Dar-
danelles.
“I’ll tell you about Paddy,” said Jim, and then,
of course, he did nothing of the soi-t. Jim is too
like his brother Pat, who did many things and
preserved them in a fine memory. They were two of
four Irish brothers, boiin on the Loddon, who to-
gether pulled through the closest thing there is to a
perish from thirst recorded in Australia short of
actual death from drought. Pat Nolan’s - memory
was always a dividend payer—you had merely to sink
on him, put in levels evei-y 20ft., and never drive in
anything but payable yarns. Pat is still battling
away in the West. He hasn’t been in Perth since
1892, and little in even the goldfields towns, but
he still talks cheerfully of making the big wise that
the brothers nearly made with the Treasure at Pur-
namoota and of hobbling his horses out in the
garden opposite the G.P.O. at Perth. If he does, I
can see St. George’s Terrace foaming at the mouth,
and Mr. Roe fining- Pat £2OOO or -something with
costs.
Pat and Charlie Webb Were mates at Zeehan, and
the title of their residence area was disputed by a
local wowser—partly for his church, and partly for
himself. The wowser built a chui-ch on the block,
and then the parson came round to ask Pat and his
mate to do the graceful thing- and give up possession.
Pat, lying in his bunk, listened for an hour and a
half,-- and then asked the roof what the the
parson was talking about. Next day the mates got
some horses and pulled the church off the block.
Charlie Webb was arrested for stealing a church, and
sentenced to a month’s gaol. He did three days,
when the Attorney-General heard of the joke and
ordered his, release. There was the other case of
the Westralian gentleman who stole a 10-head battery
and got away with it for 100 miles. But that was a
“fair dinkum steal”; Webb’s church lifting was
merely facetious.
“Well, Jim, what about young Pat?”
“He’s all right; but did I tell you of our perish
on the ’Bidgee?. .. .Never mind if I did. I’ll tell
you again: ...”
“And Pat?”
“D’ye, remember when Charlie Webb kept the pub
at Pindinni ? Well, the other pub had a gramophone,
but Charlie went one better, and got a cash
register. Took all the tx-ade. White men and
niggers ’d come there to hear the thing registering
up a bob when they spent it.”
“I’ve seen a photo,” said Charlie Webb, “with
Madame Melba, the prettiest gin in Pindinni, at the
cash register, and John Foi'rest sittin’ on the
counter.”
“What was John doing there?”
“Not old Jack. John Forrest —a piccaninny—the
first half-caste born at Donkey Rocks.”
“What about young Pat?”
“There was two mates at Mt. Margaret. The
chap below fired. Fuses spittin’. Tells his mate on
the brace to haul him up. Braceman starts to haul.
They’re working too deep for the rope. There’s not
enough coils on the windlass, and the barrel slips
round inside the rope. Braceman hollers down: ‘P
that weak to-day, Bill,’ he says —‘come up hand-
over-hand, will you?’ ‘All right,’ says Bill, and gets
up without bustling, just in time. Good nerve that
braceman had.”
“And about young. Pat?”
“Oh, I’ve got to go and drive the cow home. But
I’ll tell you this much. If young Pat hasn’t
changed, God help the Turks!”
SPRING PUTS ON HER PINAFORE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Blossom-time is round again
Spite of grim old war !
Earth sex ins almost jolly when
Spring's bright pinafore
Shows amongst the orchard tx-ees.
Noiv’s the harvest time for bees !
Stroll along and hear their hum
As they climb and swing ;
Swiftly to the feast they come,
Carolling of Spring.
Honey for their secret store
Holds the blossom pinafore.
Wattles stand like towers of gold ;
But the questing- bees,
Loaded full as they can hold,
Leave the flaunting trees,
And on business bent alight
On the sweet banks pink and white.
Petals on the furrowed face
Of the patient earth ;
In the blue the white clouds race.
What a day for mirth !
And a gay wind sauntering by
Sighs and sings, “ You’ll never die!”
Spring has donned her pinafore,
Snowy-white and pink
For the millionth gay encore
With a roguish wink.
If I wore so well, then l
Would be convinced I’d never die !

Sensational Triumph for
De Witts.
Man 76 Years Old Cured of STONE in the Bladder.
Surgeon Amazed—No Operation. Cured 1913. Still Cured 1915.
Here is one of the most sensational and wonderful cases on record. It
is not an exaggeration, but just tire plain and tiuthful statement ot an old
gentleman, seventy-six years of age, wlio was cured of stone In the bladdei,
without operation, when almost all hope had been abandoned.
About four years ago this old English gentleman —Mr. C. -T. Watts is bis
name —was taken very ill with severe pains in the hack and a
burning, aching pain internally. He suffered badly from
urinary weakness. He became so ill and the pain became so
bad that he could not bend, or even turn in bed. Month after
month he tried all kinds of so-called remedies, including
“Kidney Mixtures” and “Backache Pills,” hut he got no
relief. He got steadily worse, until at the end of four years
he had practically given up all hope of being cured.
SECOND BOX-CURED.
One day he heard of the wonderful cures effected by He
Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills, and he went to Boots’ shop
in Caledonian Koad (the largest retail Chemists in the world)
and got a small-size box. He finished this box and
commenced on another. Before he had finished the second
box he passed from the bladder two large, awful-looking
rough stones and several small ones, all covered with sharp-
pointed crystals. This happened on December 30 1913,
about 6 o’clock in the morning.
Mr. Watts was so impressed with the size of these
stones, which seemed so extraordinary, that he took them
and showed them to a well-known doctor, who expressed astonishment that
such stones should have been passed without an operation, and especially by a
man of seventy-six years of age. . . .
Mr. C. J. WA TTS (from plwto.).
Mr. Watts, in writing the proprietors regarding this wonderful incident,
states:—“Many people might doubt the truth of this letter, but I am well known
in this district, and have only stated the bare facts. Apart from my own case of
Stone in the Bladder, I have heard of a lot of cases of Rheumatism, Gout,
Backache, Cystitis (Inflammation of the Bladder), and other kidney and bladder
complaints which have been cured by De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills.
DE WITT’S ALONE SAVED HIM.
“I live at 62 Huntingdon Street, Barnsbury, N., and if any-
body still doubts that De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills
really do cure, let them refer to me and see for themselves, for
I certainly think that others ought to know of this marvellous
remedy.
“I have heard of young people being cured of this
painful complaint, but a remedy which will cure a man of
seventy-six years of age is surely the greatest of all.”
Mr. Watts, writing on February 11, 1915, says: “I am
pleased to say I have had no further trouble with stone in the
bladder. I thank you sincerely for the wonderful cure De
Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills have effected in me—a man
nearly eighty years of age.”
Every chemist and storekeeper sells De Witt’s Kidney
and Bladder Pills at 2/9 per box, or 5/6 for one 2% times
as large—a great save. But you must be sure you get
De WITT’S in large blue and gold boxes, with special blue
seal on the cork inside.
To cure Kidney trouble of any kind you must posi-
tively get rid of the cause —the poisonous Uric Acid.
Remember, to do this, a real remedy must pass through
the kidneys and the bladder, and not through the bowels
as most kidney pills do. When you see the Urine
change to a muddy bluish color—a feature which dis-
tinguishes De Witt’s Pills from all others—you know
beyond all doubt that they have put their healing touch on the right spot —
the kidneys and the bladder. A wonderful pill—straight to the kidneys—
that is the reason why De Witt’s give such amazingly quick relief —every
time. A permanent cure follows in almost every case.

“Verse Carpenter” : If I could start afresh
I would not mess about with odes or sweat
over sonnets. I would apprentice myself to a
prosperous clianteysian and learn liow to
make the wild, simple, monotonous verse of
the sea. What a fool a poet is to toil like a
working jeweller when he can make a living
by stamping with liis feet on a specially
sanded floor and roaring something like
this: —-
Have you ever anchored in Port Phillip Bay ?
(With a Hay! Ha! Kiss my love hard!)
’Twas there that I met with sweet Mary O’Hea,
(And we’re off to Sacramento!)
She gave me a wink and I gave her one buck !
(With a Hay! Ha! Kiss my love hard!)
I cut a new quid and I hauled up the slack!
And we’re off to Sacramento!
Chorus.
Hay ! Ha ! Bully boys ! Whoo !
Wow! Yow ! One cent-o !
She gave me a wink and I gave her one back,
And we’re off to Sacramento !
And so on for several more verses. Every
time I read that the British tar works and
lives hard for low wages, it strikes me that
his employers ashore must be getting back on
him for howling things like that in his work-
ing time. Or perhaps lie doesn’t really howl
at all. The employers may perhaps bribe
men to write these chanteys and suggest to
the public that the tar sings them, with the
view of showing that lie’s a person who
deserves no sympathy.
Aslimead Bartlett, who has been stirring
Billjim’s mates with vivid stories from Gal-
lipoli, draws £3OOO a year and exes.—the lar-
gest salary ever paid to a war correspondent
within the memory of Fleet-street. He began
work at the Front for £lBOO a year, but
when he went, back to London in May he
struck a rise of £lOO a month. Incidentally,
the most highly-paid Australian censor, wlio
is free to slash Bartlett’s stuff with the rest,
draws £6lO a year.

“S.T.S.”: What can you believe in the
papers about the war? London Graphic,
of 26/6/T5. has a spirited sketch “by
Arturo Bianehini, our special artist with
the British expeditionary force at the Dar-
danelles,” of a cavalry charge in Gallipoli!
—“The Australian mounted infantry ad-
vancing in the face of a furious fire.” tie
has got the Australian uniform fairly well,
but every one is horsed —gun teams and all.
One had understood that there is not a horse
on the peninsula. Is Bianehini just an un-
usually shameless fabricator? Or ?
* * * *
Adelaide Register has struck, in a 50-
years-old issue, a “training-notes” allusion
to poet Lindsay Gordon, then known merely
as an eccentric State M.P. and a keen
sportsman:—•
The Steeplechase on September 21 will probably
be one of the most interesting events held in South
Aus. Those who frequent the Bay Road in the morn-
ing or evening- know whether or not Cadger can leap,
and whether or not his Honorable owner can keep
his seat over a fence. It strikes us very forcibly
that both the horse and his rider know very well
how to go across country, and are sure to take a
good place. But will Mr. Gordon ride Cadger him-
self ? Much may depend upon that.
Gordon, by the way, did ride the horse him-
self. But it didn’t win.
“Sammy” Samson, the only frequenter of
the reporters’ gallery at Federal Parliament
House who dares to wear a monocle, is now-
adays congratulating himself upon his suc-
cess in having a nephew decorated by
France with the Cross of the Legion of
Honor. Wing-Commander Samson, the man
who received the cross, bosses the naval sec-
tion of the R.F.C., and is now working over
the Dardanelles.
“J.F.IL”: A couple of prominent person-
alities have dropped out of our London inky
way. John Corlett. long-time editor and
proprietor of the Sporting Times, popu-
larly known as the Pink ’Un, knew every-
thing that was worth knowing about horses,
and his weekly article on racing had great
weight. Although the front page of the
. Pink ’Un was spiced with smoking-room
yarns, “Master” Corlett was really a very
religious person—on Sundays. At Maid-
stone, in Kent, where he had a country
house, he was a typical squire, acted as
churchwarden, and “read the lessons” regu-
larly. Alex. C. Kenealy, editor of the Daily
Mirror, who has also crossed the Divide,
was a son of the clever but cantankerous
Dr. Kenealy, Q.C.. who defended the Wagga
butcher-impostor of half a century ago. The
defence of the Ticliborne claimant, by the
way, turned the very able and erudite barris-
ter into a crank. He blackguarded Lord
Chief Justice Cockburn, the godfather of
the son just deceased, and behaved so out-
rageously that he was expelled from the Eng-
lish Bar. The boy started on the New York
Herald at 18, and accompanied Peary’s
first expedition to the Arctic. After seeing
the U.S.A. fleet through the war with
Spain, he came to London and joined the
Daily Express, from which he was stolen
by the Harmsworths, who placed him in
charge of the Daily Mirror, an early failure
which lie and Northcliffe between them
transformed into a thorough success.
“T. 0.1.”: The ancient Tahitian book
printed by George Howe has been sold in
London for £l7 ss. Another copy was dis-
covered in the British Museum. This is
not the first Australian book printed. The
“Standing Orders” —meaning Government
Orders—were printed and published in 1802
by George Howe. George was a prisoner of
the Crown. Three copies are known, two
being in the Mitchell Library and one in
the British Museum. The first Australian
proclamations printed were issued in 1795,
the printer being George Hughes, also a
prisoner of the Crown, and, worse still, an
amateur actor. In Van Diemen’s Land in
ISIS Bent issued a pamphlet, “The Life
and Death of Mike Howe, the Last and
Worst of the Bushrangers of Van Diemen’s
Land.” This was the first book printed in
Tasmania.
Mab Treeby, the clever girl whose wash
drawings are well known to Bulletin
habitues, still pushes on. She scores a full
page in the Summer Number of London
Sketch, one of the brightest of Bull’s illus-
trated weeklies.

“Boyd Cable,” the writer of so many
good pars, from the trenches and the artil-
lery-observation pigeon-lofts, is among the
good many who have had the pleasure of
reading of their wounds instead of suffering
from any. He writes in cheerfully that his
friends have probably been more pained by
the report than he by the missile.

“D.F.”: Sergeant Collier, till recently on
the literary staff of Hobart Mercury, has
had to climb through so many obstacles to
get a start for the Front that he reckons
the rest of the job will be easy by compari-
son. First he was told that if he had an
operation he could pass the medical test,
lie had it and put in a few weeks in hos-
pital. When he bobbed up again he was
passed out on his eyesight. He got a few pairs
of spectacles, and tried once more. One doctor
passed him and he went to the camp, where
another doctor told him he would not do.
But by this time he was used to that yarn
and took no notice of ii.

“In the evening the team was enter-
tained with a fiance.” said the up-country
paper in its report of the visit of a bunch
of footballers. It was a friendly thing to
do. But, alas, the courtesy was merely ex-
tended in the mind of the comp. In cold
fact the team was provided with a dance!
“T.F.M.”: About Gordon’s “From the
Wreck,” “North Terrace” (B. 15/7/T5) is
right. Gordon was not in the Mount Gam-
bier district when the Admella came to
grief, nor do the verses describe a ride
from Livingstone’s homestead to the town-
ship. The distance is only 15 miles • and
the ride described lasted from the middle of
the night until after sunrise, one horse being
ridden to a standstill and another to death.
But in regard to the identity of the man
who did carry the news of the Admella’s
plight to Mount Gambier. I decline to accept
the ipse dixit of “North Terrace,” or anyone
else, that it was one Peter Begg. The names
of the men alleged to have executed the
mission are as plentiful ns the breeders of
Gordon’s mare, but the reports appearing in
the Adelaide and Melbourne papers' at the
time have convinced me—-until supplied with
better evidence —that it was Cant. Germein,
Pie lighthouse-keeper at Cape Northumber-
land.
“Copy Boy”: The censor’s latest freak is
to forbid the mention by name of any
officer in letters from the Front. Soon the
public will be invited to consider itself
thrilled into enlisting by such messages as
this :
The brigade, under Brigadier-General ,
after several days’ hard fighting, has captured an
important Turkish position at . Unfortunately
the victory was not achieved without great loss of
life. Colonel was killed, and Major
severely wounded. For conspicuous bravery under
fire Corporal has been awarded the V.C.
War reports will, in fact, resemble a pic-
turesque account of a horse-race in which
the nags are not mentioned by name, the
result being given as “ ■ 1, and
(dead heat) 2.”
* * * *
“Quarter Single” : Much has been done by
the Australian Journalists’ Association to
discourage the cheap parson who undercuts
the struggling linesman by supplying news
items for nothing to the great dailies. He
is further discouraged by the war, which
restricts the space that otherwise his rev-
erence might occupy. So far so good, as
regards the prose writers. But what about
the holy “poet” who takes the bread from
the mouth of the professional jinglers. These
remarks, made more in anger than in
sorrow, are prompted by a screed of the Rev.
Alexander McCallum, which the Argus
prints. It purports to be either blank verse
or verse libre. It is neither. It is called
“Constantinople,” and is verbal driftwood
sawn into lengths and stacked. The stack
is a quarter-column high, and it is McCal-
lum’s second offence. The lines purport to
describe how the British race will absorb
Constantinople. The last log :
Already have we paid toll of our very best,
And we have not wearied of the task, nor will we,
Until we stand within the city that Constantine built,
And where the Saracens have so long misruled.
Side by side with their kinsfolk—whose quarrel this
is—•
There shall stand a sun-browned legion,
Who have made the quarrel theirs,
Because in their far-off southern homes they have not
forgot
That the right, given them to accomplish their own
nationhood,
Was clearly bought by the race who gave it them,
And willing comrades have the father and the sons
become,
That they, and all men, might breathe a free air in
God’s great world.
In the name of the Seven Holy Hatpins and
the Noxious Weeds Act, how much longer
will the Argus continue as patron of the
Tripe Dressers’ Union?
LAWSON’S DREAM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I dreamed I lay shot through and mu tilated,
And buried in the trench we filled again,
And all the heaps above the loved and hated
Were levelled down and flattened by the rain.
1 dreamed I saw the daily-paper posters,
1 watched the Sydney people stand and stare--
The Blankers, By-.loves and the Holy-Ghosters;
The Well-I-Nevers and Just-Fancies fair —
To see “The Death of llenry Lawson” printed,
In letters tall and black and fairly stout;
To read be died a hero, hear it hinted
That all his debts were paid—-the Bill Wiped Out!
I dreamed I lay beneath the briny ocean,
And mothers blessed my name with one accord,
And hearts I loved were moved with great emotion
To hear I volunteered to stay abroad ;
And how I cheered the still-faced doomed, and fed
them
On tales of hope, a “message from the sea.”
I dreamed the Lv-ee-moon’s sad hell had led them—
Had led a nation’s bells that tolled for me.
I dreamed my boyhood’s dream that long had faded,
To glow in clouds of selfish war at last;
I dreamed I fought in cities barricaded
With all my dream-companions of the past.
I dreamed I died for Justice and was honored
By all the sister nations near and far —
And woke -to thirst and reek and oaths and spittle ;
For these were day-dreams in a Public Bar.
n.s.w.
HENRY LAWSON.
THE PAPER FAMINE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Maoriland is threatened with a paper famine, and
the Dominion may be forced to return to primitive
methods of communication.
Let paper go ! On Brunswick brick
I’ll write the rhyme that pleases me,
And guarantee its passage slick
To generous posterity;
For if an editor decline
The happy lines that he has read,
What joy to rise with valor fine
And. hurl the sonnet at his head!
VICTORIA.

CROUP.
“ The most anxious time for parents is when their children have
croup. Unless prepared with Chamberlain s Cough Remedy they
must wait for the doctor, listen to the choking metallic cough and
watch their little one gasping for breath.
Croup causes a false membrane to form in the voice box;
until expelled the spasmodic choking continues.
nmKRLNin
COUGH BEMEBY
(MADE IN AUSTRALIA.)
given in frequent doses will loosen this false membrane and cause the child to expel it by vomiting.
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy is an absolutely safe and certain remedy for croup. If given as soon as
the child becomes hoarse or even after the croupy cough appears, it will prevent the attack.”

TARES THE FAT OFF!
99
LET US SEND YOU A FREE SAMPLE.
Over fat ® xcees i n i ures your health, impedes
D . your movements, and makes you the
People butt of your unfeeling, normal-weight
friends. People who are excessively fat never feel
well and vigorous like normal folks. You know this
Is true. People who have been fat, and are now re-
duced to normal, think other people ridiculous.
Excess fat also impedes the heart action, rendering
the functions difficult, and interferes with the breath-
ing. Not alone does excess fat injure your health
and endanger your existence, it absolutely destroys
your figure and makes you a ludicrous sight. Why
do you stay fat?
“TI-SARK.IN ”
positively removes excess fat and will restore your
spoiled figure to decent and pleasing proportions;
it is always a sure and lasting cure for obesity and
corpulency. A few doses improves your breathing
wonderfully, and the course of treatment will cure
you. It -is the only successful and, at the same
time, harmless fat-reducer that has ever been dis-
covered. Its efficacy has been undeniably demon-
strated in thousands of successfully treated cases.
It is totally and absolutely non-poisonous, and can
in no wise work any injury to the general health,
even though it often reduces excess of weight by as
much as a pound a day. On the contrary, improved
conditions in the general health become noticeable in
less than a week after its use is begun.
“TI-SARKIN” is not a patent pill sold regardless
of individual symptoms, but it is a scientific treatment
in each special case. Obesity cannot be cured by
drastic purging pills. They invariably injure.
Manager, Watvvorth Co. Cuprona* Tas.
Dear Sir, —In replying to your kind inquiry as to tin
permanency of my reduction from the use of “Ti-sarkin” I am
pleased to tell you that the results are far more satisfactory
than I ever anticipated they could possibly be. “Ti-sarkin” has
produced a wonderful improvement in my health and condi-
tion. When I began its use I weighed 13st. 31b., and I began
to lose weight after the first few doses, and continued rapidly
for the next three months, by which time I was quite satisfied
that I was thin enough, Before
taking “Ti-sarkin” my work was alway's a burden, but since my
reduction it is just the reverse, and now I am able to take real
Xileasure and interest in all about me. My friends all marvel
at my rapid loss of weight and vast improvement in my.
general health. They say they can scarcely' believe their eyes,
and they', as well as myself, feel very pleased, and your
methods gained many' warm advocates from the success in
my case.
I hope that many faltering women whose excess weight is
a burden to them, will be convinced by my' experience, and my
earnest advice to all my' fat friends is to have a course. Now I
eat heartily and enjoy my' food, and find no cause whatever
for complaint.
You are at liberty' to make whatever use you may choose
of this letter. Yours sincerely,
(Signed) Mrs. A. CARR.

tin year gone whin yer tame bogged hopeless on the
grass thrack t’ Chiffeny’s mill.’ ‘l’m remimb’rin’
ye well, man, an’ ye’re wcUkim t’ the dthrop iv
dthrink an’ the bit iv ’atin’; will yell come in?
Sure, ’n’ I’m beholdin’ to yell all th’ days iv me
life fer yer kind hear.rt an’ hospitality. Come in,
’n’ don’t deny me!’ He tuck Matty in an’ give him
good ay tin wid a round iv cor-rn bafe, an’ cabbage
biled in the juice, an’ slathers iv duff, an’ Brady
told iv the horse he lost, an’ was seekin’ the long
day. ‘Maybe ye’ve heard iv him, ye’ve seen him
’tis possible—a tall roan he is, wid wan white fut
an’ a Roman nose like anny Hebrew.’ Terry McCree
thought liar-rd, pickin’ his teeth. ‘A tall horse,’ he
sez, ‘ ’n’ a roan,’ sez he. ‘ ’Tis sorry I am, nothin’
iv the like hev come me way this tree years; but
ye’ll maybe look further. He niver went past, but
’tis possible he’s gone on, did yeh thrace him so
fill.’ ‘A man seen him dthrinkin’ be the crick wan
mile back iv Chewsdee,’ sez Brady. ‘Sorra’s me ’tis
on hunthred an’ more miles away he may be be
this. Would yeh lave me the loan iv the horse I
hear ditherin’ in yer shtable fer a day or two per-
haps, an’ a pound I’ll pay yeh.’ ‘Ye'll not pay me
anny pound, Mathew Brady,’ sez McCree. ‘Greatly
beholdin’ to yeh I am, an’ fer ten shillin’ ye’ll have
the baste, niyer a penny more.’ Afther dinner McCree
lining Brady t’ the horse, a fine, upshtandin’ neddy
he was, new dipt, wid a blaze down his face, an’
wan black fut, an’ McCree helpt Brady aboord, an’
wisht him well most generous. Fer two long days
Brady rid the horse fan- an’ wide, seekin’ the lost
prad, an’ findin’ nothin’ of him. Terry McCree
was thruly sympathetic an’ gen’rous—not a cint
more thun tin shillin’ did he take. Then Brady
wint home, an’ later McCree tuck his horse an’ sold
it to a daler frim Injia. For Terry McCree was a
man wid great knowledge iv the tinkerin’ iv a horse,
would clip him t’ change his gineral aspect, squirt a
thrifle iv par-rafin to a shlit in his skin t’ alther the
Roman twisht if his nose, an’ make a pug iv ut
maybe, t’ bl’acli a w’ite blaze on his face wid
chimicals, ’n’ tur-rn a white heel black in tin min-
utes. So ’twas not exthraordin’ry at all Mat Brady
rid his own horse two days lookin’ iv’rywhere for
the very wan he was ridin’.”
An agitation is being conducted by Mel-
bourne timber merchants in favor of re-
afforestation and the use of Australian tim-
bers. Some interesting allegations have
been made during the discussion. One is
that three-fourths of an area will produce
more grain or fruit with the other fourth in
forest trees than the whole without the trees.
This is putting the matter in a large, ex-
pansive way; yet it is well known in the
orchard districts around Sydney that gardens
which thrived when they were surrounded
by forest trees sent their owners up Iving-
street when the trees were hacked down.
Another allegation is that a blue-gum at 30
years will produce twice, perhaps three
times, as much marketable timber as an oak
at 160 years. Apparently this is mentioned
by way of encouraging Australia not to des-
pair because on subjects like national service
and protection the British head is mere sap-
wood for so many years.
One of the things that staggered Billjim
when he first got to Egypt was the system
of delivering the morning milk. The cow
proprietor drives Strawberry from customer
to customer, milking the required quantity
of juice into the family jug at the door.
There are points about this —the practice
cuts out some at least of the disabilities of
living in a country where no native ever
takes the trouble to wash anything.
“Ananias” : About Australian pine boxes.
For the alleged odor stinking fish are re-
sponsible. First lot were saturated with
Darling Harbor juice. I know. Helped to
make them. Age of pine has nothing to do
with the h.p. of the smell. Some smell
stronger than others. Dark short-grained
timber is worst. White ants shy at brown
variety. White is most plentiful; also free
from smell if dried in open air. Then fit
for food packages. If made up before
seasoning will go blue mouldy. Most scrub
wood does. Then it gives bad flavor to food-
stuff's.
At the big Addington market, near Christ-
church (M.L.), recently, a pen of fat Shrop-
shire-cross wethers brought £3 15s. per head,
which is the record price for butcher's meat
of the jumbuek variety so far this season.
Evidently chops are going to be 2s. each,
and you won’t talk about a man owning a
few sheep—you’ll talk about a sheep own-
ing a few men.
“Queensland Selector”: Meat-eaters are
growling that mutton is too dear. Maybe it
is; but the man who grows the sheep isn’t
getting much of the fat. We have just sold
2000 fat wethers (six months’ wool) for
10s. Last August we could have got 14s. 6d.
You see we are jambed for grass, and have
been obliged to sell. Other growers are in
the same hole, and buyers have closed on
150,000 sheep out this way at l'Qs. They
made an offer of 3s. for a line of dry ewes
on one station. The owners tried to get 55.,
but couldn’t. A big adjoining place has had
to take ss. (id. for sheep that were easily
worth Bs. Gd. to the buyer. While we put
a fat wether on the truck for 10s. and Is.
will land the sheep at Townsville (with a
pelt worth 35.). Sydney has to pay Is. for a
pound of chops! I will say this for the
middleman in the meat business: he is a
fair-minded shark. lie will bite consumer
and producer with equal unconcern.

INDIGESTION AND SLUGGISH
LIVER.
GOOD HEALTH RESTORED BY DR.
MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT PILLS.
SAYS BALLARAT LADY.
“For some years I was in a very bad state
of health,” writes Mrs. F. Cummins, of 10
Havelock Street, Ballarat East. “Indigestion
and sluggish action of the liver were two of
my worst complaints. I could not eat a
little of the lightest food without having to
endure awful pain and misery. I got very
weak and thin, and could hardly keep on my
feet at all. I felt very ill, and was com-
pletely run down until some months back I
was strongly advised to give Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills a trial. Having met with
so many disappointments from other patent
medicines I was delighted on finding myself
greatly improved and much better in health
than I had been for many months previ-
ously. After taking a bottle of Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills I could eat and sleep much
better, the pains and distressing symptoms
became milder, and by the time I had taken
four bottles I was well and strong again.
Y"ou may use this statement for advertising

POLITICAL
POINTS
Referring to the proposal to raise a tariff
wall against German goods, Customs Minis-
ter Tudor lately said he was not enamored
of it, his own idea being to “impose such a
tariff against everyone as would enable the
Commonwealth to establish its own indus-
tries. When that had been done the duties
against countries other than Britain might
be raised higher still.” It is an excellent
idea, the only drawback to it being that
Tudor’s party has no present intention of
carrying it out. It would be “con-
tentious legislation.” That is to say,
it would be to the advantage of Aus-
tralian industries and to the disad-
vantage of everybody else’s, and any old
excuse is good enough to hang the matter up
when only Australia’s interests clamor for
action.
CHANGING THE TUNE.
AMSTERDAM, August 11.—Lissauer's “Song of Hate"
against England is losing favor in Germany. The
Berlin TAGEBLATT has approvingly quoted from the
Cologne VOLKS ZEITUNG a letter from a clergyman
deploring the song, and urging its removal from the
books of the school children. — Cable.
THE KAISER: “Tam you! Vy you don’t sing
this like you used to?”
HANS: “ Pardon, your Majesty; hut ve tinks
this a Long Way to Tipperary’ vas
much more to der point.”
The murk which surrounds the gro-
tesquely mismanaged State trading concerns
of Westralia gets thicker and thicker. The
Government imported a manager for one
branch of its activities. After a couple of
years this man (according to Minister Ang-
win) had no idea whether it costs ten shil-
lings. ten pounds or the equivalent of the
Deficit to turn out any article from the fac-
tory lie controls. Naturally the officer has
been calling for an inquiry into these and
many other allegations; but the lion. Minis-
ter has chipped in with the assurance that
there is no need for an inquiry. Incident-
ally he adds that the other gentleman’s char-
acter is not “worth a struck match.” Yet this
is the individual of whom the Government

The agitation to close the Stadium continues, and
there is still some chance of its success. —News item.

remarked, not more than six months ago,
that he was the best servant in the State's
employ. If only half what the Government
says how is true, this seems a pretty dread-
ful thing to have said of the public service.
“Copabella” : As a young
man in England I was, of
course, a Freetrader, Freetrade,
like liberty of speech and our
old nobility, being one of the
bulwarks of the nation. As a
retailer of mostly-imported lines
I was, and am, naturally a
Freetrader here, too, the Free-
trade side being the one upon
which my bread is buttered.
But our dependence on overseas
is appalling. On the cheap and
simple commodities we import —•
washing soda (4s. Gd. per cwt.),
Epsom salts (155.), whiting
(4s. Gd.), bluestone (225.), car-
bonate of soda (Ss. Gd.) —the
freight is often more than the
value of the goods themselves.
With the shortage of cream of
tartar various substitutes for
“jump-up” are being used, most
of them dragged half-way round
the world from the U.S.A. One
of them is mono-basic sulphate
of soda, a cousin-german of
horse-salts. 1 Horse-salts are
worth about 3d. a pound; the
other Is., most of it freight!
When will we learn to depend
on ourselves —and not pay 9d.

The Bulletin observes with grief and
pleasure that while the Mayor of N’York
was in camp, training, burglars carried off
two carloads of goods from liis town house.
Grief at the burglars’ "rascality is over-
shadowed by pleasure at the news that the
Mayor of N’Yark is learning how to dig
a trench and throw a hand grenade —in
company, it seems, with “thousands of
young men who are spending their holidays
in training camp.” Uncle Sam has had to
suffer dreadful humiliations these last nine
months; and at this sign that he is mixing
military training with his burglary, Aus-
tralia gives him three cheers of encourage-
ment. Next to Sam himself nobody is so
interested in that training as the white
country on this shore of the Pacific.
The war is pushing the anti-Soshers into
all sorts of Socialistic things. Thus, having
cut down the hours during which hotels may
sell grog, Victoria's Government has now
introduced a co-ordinating bill whereby re-
bates of one-seventh of the fees paid are
to he returned to licensees, and their land-
lords are to he invited to return a similar
proportion of the rent. Should the landlords
be hard of hearing, as is possible, the
Licenses Reduction Board is to “settle the
matter on a fair and equitable basis,” and
there is to he no appeal. Now, if the State
orders the landlord to reduce the rent when
it cuts down the publican’s income, why
should every other rent not be subject to
revision, at any rate after every other act
of government which can affect: earnings or
outgoings?
At the Easier Labor confer-
ence, when asked by a delegate
if the Government would
tackle the Leg. Council dur-
ing the life of the present
Parliament, Holman countered
with : “When the Upper House
throws out any legislation that
will precipitate a crisis the Min-
istry will take up the gauntlet.”
(Cheers.) Cornered with “Will
yon pledge conference that the
crisis will be created before next
Easter V” Holman promptly
stated that the Government
“would push ahead with its pro-
gramme irrespective of what
the Council might think or do.”
(More cheers.) Meanwhile
plank No. 1 of the party pro-
gramme (“Abolition of the Up-
per House”), which would bring
about the biggest possible howl
of protest from the Council, is
of course ignored. The amend-
ing Local Government Bill was
expected to cause trouble this
session. Fat has plainly indi-
cated that it will fight the Bill
to the last ditch. But instead
of accepting the challenge the
P.L.L. Executive has issued a
circular to all branches of the
organisation, urging that peti-
tions be prepared and forwarded
to each House praying that the
Bill may be passed. Obviously
the bosses of the party are pre-
pared to do almost anything in
order to prevent such a conflict
with the Leg. Council as
might force them to attack that Chamber.
Instead of “Abolition of the Leg. Council”
the Holman policy seems to be really “Addi-
tions to the Leg. Council.” Membership is
such a cheap and handy reward.
One dead infant on the doorstep doesn’t
make a winter; but four of them discovered,
in Melbourne in one day suggest that the
snow-clouds are rolling up. Meantime
nothing is done in the way of providing the
Foundling Home where the little immigrant
might be taken in and no questions asked.
Australia, which wants population worse than
any other country on earth, is hurling its
adults into battle and sudden death, and is
offering only the cold doorstep to the infant
whose mother isn’t in a position to keep and
acknowledge it.
Justice Rich, the Commonwealth's Com-
missioner, condemned the Defence Depart-
ment for having no dentists with the A.M.C.
at Liverpool, remembering the tremendous
military importance attached to teeth. There
are a lot of other things the Judge would
condemn if he knew about them. A leading-
chiropodist with a vice-regal connection
lately wrote formally asking permission to
visit camp at week-ends and attend the sol-
diers professionally, free of charge or adver-
tisement. He pointed out that numbers had
called on him during their leave; but, being
unable to see him at cince, many were
forced to go away with their foot troubles
unattended to. Being a good Australian, he
was willing to go to the soldiers and give
them what they were willing to come to him
and pay for. He didn’t even want exes. In
10 days’ time the curt departmental reply
arrived—“lt is regretted that permission
cannot be given to carry out your profes-
sional services at Liverpool.” Seeing the
military importance attached also to the
foot, what excuse can there be for such
asininity ?
Premier Holman has somewhat revived
N.S.W. Public Service by stating that the
Government has not any intention of pro-
posing an all-round reduction in salaries.
Instead, it has been decided that no increases
are to be given to those receiving over £2OO
a year, and that officers promoted are not to
get additional pay except in unusual cases.
Also, Holman drops a dark and sinister hint
that the Government may ask the Service to
work a whole half-hour longer per day, from
4.30 to 5 pan. This “frightfulness” will bo
met with hardened stoicism by a minority
who seldom leave work until after five o’clock,
but it will bring home to the 4.30 stam-
peders the cold fact that war isn't all it s
cracked up to be.
THE MISSING LINK.
ZURICH, Monday.—Such a great variety of races
are included in the Russian prisoners that the Vienna
Academy of Sciences has voted a professor 4000
crowns "(about £160) to conduct anthropological
research.— Cable.
GERMAN COLONEI : “Der prisoners cos
ready.”
The first organised gang of pro-Germans
in Australia met at Berth recently under the
disguise of the Farmers and Settlers’ Con-
ference —meaning thereby that a few farm-
ers and settlers conferred, and a lot of
reactionary politicians, middlemen, im-
porters and such-like “primary producers”
met to throw dirt at Australia. The “con-
ference” opened with loud cheers for the
Empire and closed with veiled curses on
Australian industries. As an earnest of its
desire to help Australian industries and
Australian defence the first resolution,
which was strongly supported though ulti-
mately withdrawn, was to the purport that
while there are effective Customs duties on
agricultural implements members refuse to
buy machinery made in Australia. The
stupidity of the proposal is apparent to any-
body who knows that since high duties were
adopted agricultural machinery has been
cheaper than when it was practically duty
free. Then the conference passed a _ resolu-
tion to boycott German goods—not with pro-
hibitive Protection, which would make the
boycott sure, but. by the sort of honorable
understanding which everybody leaves it to
his neighbor to keep. This is the patriotism
of the Freetrader, who demanded the right
to “develop the Empire” in his own way—
and used liis “right” to develop the enemy
which was busy preparing to cut the Em-
pire’s throat.
DAZZLING PROSPECTS.
The Kaiser telephoned the news of the occupation
of Warsaw to the Kaiserin. There were excited
demonstrations. German civilians kissed the police-
men. — Cable.
CONSTABLE O'DOOLEY: “Faith, wait till the
bhoys gets to Conshtantinople!"
Every time any attempt is made now to
use the war as an excuse for shutting up
pubs early, the politician is reminded that
when the matter was submitted to S. Aus.
the people enthusiastically voted for the
shutters at six o’clock. What never is men-
tioned is that the shutters haven’t gone up
in S. Aus. at six o’clock yet aud are not
likely to for many a day, because, as soon
as the public was faced with the gloom, it
yelled, and resolutions were passed and
requests bowed in begging the Government
t<> exclude this and that portion. In short,
the S. Australian decided in favor of the
reform —for his sinful neighbor.
IN TIME OF WAR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Our fathers bled that we might be made free ;
Nor deemed they any sacrifice could be
Too great, could they, enheartened by God’s grace,
But meet the very Devil face to face
And hew their path to peace triumphantly.
As men they stood, nor bent a craven knee
To panoplied tyrant or autocracy.
When need arose, in any time and place,
Our fathers bled.
They laughed at death, and only feared disgrace.
No righteous cause but fired their stalwart race.
Their dying breaths were challenges. Shall we
Sleep ’mid ill weeds on paths that worthily
They cleared, or plead for pity to the base ?
Our fathers bled !
Ihe hour has come ! The clamorous tocsins sound.
Earth once again is Freedom’s battle-ground.
Our fathers’ sons now spill their blood like wine,
Meet offering to their sires. The foe malign
Tends Hell’s rank harvest in the fields around.
Shall we sit snivelling while cold Hate is crowned,
And Lust Imperial mocks us purple-gowned?
No! Not till Englishmen are meek as kine!
The hour has come!
Let like seek like. Herd ye with fatted swine,
Ye that malinger whimpering ! But mine
It is to sing to men. Hear it resound
From every camp and town where men are found,
From pillaged home and desecrated shrine.
“The hour has come!”

NOTIONS
Billy Longworth, one of the great swim-
mers of the Commonwealth and the world, didn’t mean
it when he told a press interviewer that he wasn’t
going to the war because he “didn’t believe it was
Australia’s quarrel.” His real opinion was expressed
this week when at Sydney he signed on for the
Front. Two other famed Australian swimmers,
“Happy” Eyre, the Manly surf life-saver, and young
Tommy Adrian, who showed Kahanamoku the way
home in a sensational handicap race at Sydney,
joined the colors the same day. With them went
Jim Randell, representative cricketer and senior-
grade Rugby player, and a special squad of athletic
lads from Manly where the mermen live. A. D.C.M.
has already gone to that village, and appropriately
to the son of one of the oldest inhabitants and first
barrackers for its surfing value. And, more appro-
priately, the medal and the mention in dispatches
was for an aquatic feat: young George Robey swam
out to a boat under fire and rescued the wounded
n\an who was adrift in it at The Landing.

Tennis-champion Norman Brookes is on
his way to England as a Red Cross commissioner
with Adrian Knox, K.C., chairman of the A.J.C.
The job is unsalaried, and there is no allowance what-
ever for expenses. Persistent rumors to the con-
trary have naturally caused intense fury in the
Brookes family circle at Melbourne. J. C. Parke, .who
beat Norman in Melbourne during 1912, as a member
of the British team which collared the Davis Cup in
that year, is just reported as having been wounded
at the Dardanelles. He is a captain in the Leinster
Regiment.
Lowe, of England, has drawn his first
blood by bagging the Queensland Tennis Champion-
ship .from Rice (4-6, 6-1, 6-1, 6-4). Rice and'
Todd took the doubles from Lowe and St. John (Q.)
in four sets, and Mrs. Ford adds another champion-
ship scalp to the fandangles at her belt. Wherefore
of four Queensland tennis champions, one resides in
England, three in N. S. Wales, and none in Queens-
land.

Ben and Marculfus, two of the early fan-
cies for Melbourne Cup, fought out a good finish
for the August Handicap at Flemington last Satur-
day. Ben is an imported horse, now in our 5-year-

youngster, but had otherwise shown no reason why
he shouldn’t be let into the two local Cups at 7st.
41b. and 7st. 31b. respectively. Marculfus has
7st. 61b. and 7st. 41b. for the same engagements,
and seeing that he ran Ben pretty closely the other
day when he was trying to give him 311 b., the son of
Positano —Diploma looks a better proposition than
the imported nag. On his appearance Marculfus
would pass for one of the very best. With the
colors up he has always seemed to want a lot of hard
riding, and the fact that he wasn’t raced at all for
16 months is nothing in his favor.

The two distinguished top weights from
Victoria —Lord Grey (12st. 51b.) and Rathfarnham
(list. 81b.) —gave their backers no hope in the
Adelaide G. N. Hurdle on Saturday. • Rathfarnham
hit one of the first hurdles hard enough to put him
practically out of the running, and Lord Grey,
jumping badly all the time, never got within striking
distance of the leaders. Wondergraph and Fatal
Error got the dividend places, and in a field of 15
runners they paid at the rate of 6 to 1 and 64 to 1
respectively. O blessed Tote, which often pays
backers of the second horse better than it pays the
spotters of the actual winner !
Cagou’s easy capture of the August Handi-
cap at Rosehill was his Jrst win for 16 months,
and it will set punters thinking of the flier he was
when he beat Alured and Aurifer for the Metropolitan
in 2min. 31jjsec.

Last week the A.J.C. (Sydney) carried
into effect its proposal to whittle another £lO,OOO
from its bank account for the benefit of various
patriotic funds. It was decided also that, if the
profits made during the year exceed a similar sum,
the surplus, or such of it as is necessary (there
needn’t be any doubt about it being necessary), shall
be expended in the same good cause. Since the war
started the big club has diverted over £22,000
from its funds into patriotic channels.

A punter or two broke into Sydney betting
circles last week, and backed Mountain Knight and
Sir Alwynton for the Caulfield and Melbourne Cup
double to win £37,000. It caused quite a flutter in
the clan of McNoses.
“L.D.” : Henceforth I am a staunch advo-
cate of the Tote, and if a punters’ fighting fund is
started in opposition to the alleged bookmakers’
defence fund, the reverend organiser can put me
down for a widower’s mite. At Leeton (N.S.W.) on
Saturday there was a race meeting, with six events.
The favorite won in each instance, and if a wild
plunger had risked a pound on each winner, he
would have raked in £1 11s. 84d. as his day’s win-
nings. Isn’t this a record ? But wait a bit. For
the programme of six races 11 horses stripped. There
were three runners in the first race (winner 6 to 4
on), two in the second (10 to 1 on), two in the
third (6 to 4 on), three in the fourth (5 to 1 on),
two in the fifth (50 to 1 on), and two in the last
(10 to 1 on). Yet the local paper remarks in an
aggrieved tone, “Before the last race the paddock
bookies shut up their bags and went home.”

Sister Satellite (The Welkin-Wilga),
winner of Fulham Park Plate, the first two-year-old
event of the Australian racing season, at Adelaide on
Saturday, was one of the high-priced equine flappers
at last yearling sales. T. S. Reynolds, who exchanged
1125 guineas for her, picks up £5OO of the outlay
very early. Sister showed Scampering heels to 22
competitors.

Besides Poaching (B. 19/8/T5) Banana-
land possesses two other horses which have been
earning extravagant oat-bags lately for themselves
and their bosses. Within three weeks Glint Lad
(Ladurlad —Glint) won Winter, Stand Plate and
Exhibition Handicaps at the Q.T.C. meeting and a
race at Albion Park ; while in the same time Nyarra
(True Blue—Apsley) picked up Albion Park “five
hundred”—running seven furlongs in lmin. 27fsec.,
Jsec. outside the State record —and Flying and Nun-
dah Handicaps at the Q.T.C. meeting.

Since Queensland racing clubs started to
pay full totalisator fractions, the dividends look like
the goods in an old-elo’ shop. A few of Saturday’s:
6s. lid., 275. 5d., 30s. 7d., 6:35. lid., 20s. 2d.,
255. Bd. 'the language of the pay-clerks is further
poisoning the iniquitous climate of the North.

Parliament doubts whether Perth (W.A.)
can afford to spend so much on racing, and has
appointed a select committee to look into things.
The W.A.T.C. balance-sheet showed last year’s
receipts at £50,000. This club raced on 17 days
and clubs registered with it filled in 27 days. Their
receipts, according to Honorary Minister Underwood,
who moved in the matter and claimed to know some-
thing about it, were another £50,000. Allowing
for the annual upkeep of registered bookmakers and
the cost of 300 horses in training, together with
what the 80-odd trotting meetings got out of the
public, Underwood estimated the grand cost in the
metropolitan area at about £400,000 a year. The
first obvious thing to do is to rule out the book-
maker ; and with him will go half the hangers-on
and whisperers. The State isn’t really any poorer
if a _ million pounds go through the totalisator
machines. The only difference is that Brown and
Smith have the money instead of Jones and Robin-
son, all four being plain citizens who saw wood or
make boots for a living. But if a quarter of a
million pounds passed through bookmakers’ hands,
enough would stick to keep the herd of non-produc-
ing parasites idle for months.

It is bard labor picking up cash in
Tasmanian horseracing. Last season 22 descendants
of Chiron—which headed the sires’ list —won 41
events, but the lot were worth only £2512. It’s a
long way to dissipation by that route.
*.*■■*■•*
Trainer A. Jordan had a great record in
the Apple Isle last season, when racehorses in his
care were first in 30 events. In the previous year
horses trained by him won 23 races, so the kind of
polish suitable for the prads of Tassy is evidently no
secret to him.
JOHN WREN, RECRUIT.
The Martagon stallion Martian, who
headed the list of winning sires in Maoriland last
season, has done the trick again this year, 36 repre-
sentatives of his stock having raked in £22,848 dur-
ing the just-closed racing year. This is a new
record for a sire in Loan Land, the previous record
having been held by Soult, whose stock gathered
£20,685 during the 1912-13 season. Buchanan’s
nag got his biggest lift through being the father of
both Warstep and Reputation, the two prads at the
head of the list of winning horses. They accounted
for slightly over £ll,OOO between them.

The great Jam Stakes, as described in a
S. Australian’s letter: “Among the lads are a few
who like a little flutter. I hit upon a plan. We
have a daily ration of jam. The boys back their
fancy as to the variety which will arrive each day.
As we have no money, we bet in biscuits. The
sergeant and myself run the book, which has been
very disastrous up to date. The following was yes-
terday’s result: 11 to 2 on plum and apple (any
make) ; even money marmalade (any make) ; 25 to 1
v. gooseberry (C. & B.’s), 33 to 1 v. apricot (C. &
B.), 33 to 1 v. black currant or strawberry (Hart-
ley’s), 50 to 100 to 1 agst. raspberry (any make).
As usual, the favorite won by 20 tons, finishing in a
truck all alone.
* * * *
Despite handicaps consequent upon Arma-
geddon, play in the Rugby League game in Sydney
this season has been up to its highest standard, and
lack of representative matches has been balanced
by the frequent brilliantly-spectacular club struggles.
No team has given finer displays in the N.S.W.
League’s history than Balmain, which on Saturday
left three fields as the winners of the senior-, seeond-
and third-grade competitions. In the senior-grade
match great hopes were entertained that South Syd-
ney would defeat the water-fronters and thus leave
the latter and the tough Glebe outfit to play off for
the caps. It would have been a mighty struggle ; but
Balmain had no special anxiety to make one of the
combatants. At the Agricultural Ground, in the
presence of about 15,000 people, Balmain went to
work on South Sydney determined to retain its
season record of no defeats; and, although
crippled towards the end by loss of men, it won by
7 points to 4. Further butchering Glebe’s hopes to
make a Balmain holiday, the latter’s junior team
won in its grade by whipping Glebe 9-3. And the
third-class lads of the harbor suburb won their com-
petition by outing Glebe 5-0. Now, having done
all this, what about the Front ?
The League’s senior place-list showed thus after
Balmain’s win on Saturday: Balmain, 26 points;
Glebe, 24; Newtown, 19; South Sydney, 17; Eastern
Suburbs, 12; Annandale, 6; Western Suburbs and
North Sydney, 4.
* * * *
Saturday’s games finished the first round
of Vic. League football and left Collingwood, Carlton,
Fitzroy and Melbourne to battle out the issue.
South Melb., up against ’Wood, made a feeble splash
in an effort to achieve a victory that meant the
displacement of Melb. But the team had no hope
from the start. At half-time it was 20 points in
arrear, and stayed thereabouts till the obituary notice
went up: ’Wood, 51 points; South, 33. There may
be a moral in the fact that South, which was second
last year and is now fifth, has been but little
weakened by the call to the colors, while ’Wood, fifth
last year and first now, hltSr seven of last year’s
players in khaki. The other games amounted to mere
practice matches, Carlton outing St. Kilda, Richmond
smashing Essendon, and ’Roy putting the eomeither
on Geelong to the tune of 121 points to 31. Geelong
was fourth last season, but is right at the tail of
the procession this time.
The Wallan (Vie.) football club,
like that of Wodonga (B. 5/8/’l5), has kicked the
ball out of bounds, and practically the whole of this
season’s team are now in camp. It was leading, a
long way for the premiership of the Midlands Asso-
ciation, and was sure of winning if it had had the
time to spare. Further, about half of last season’s
team has been at the Front ever since the famous
landing in Gallipoli on April 24. As far as Vie.
toeballers are concerned, no class of sports have
responded better to the call of their mates at the
Dardanelles.
* * * *
Red Watson, the Yankee lightweight who
has developed into a welter, assaulted Henri Demlin
so violently in the first hit at Sydney Stadium on
Saturday that the Belgian banged the floor with the
back of his head. The disagreeableness might as
well have ended there, but it didn’t. Demlin lought
back bravely, but had neither the skill nor the force
for the job, and the towel was hoisted in the seventh.
As a boxer the copper-topped Watson is not worth
a box of the Holman Government’s imported butter ;
as a puncher his emphasis seems to be something out
of the common. So far, however, he has not been
matched with anyone able to bash as generously in
return.

Upon his arrival at Brisbane a few days
back that tireless transcontinental motorist, Francis
Birtles, had criss-crossed Australia four times in the
same car, travelling 45,000 miles on his estimate.
Brisbane to Perth is the job now in hand. Whaffor ?
An argument in South Aus. as to
the date of the first race meeting in Australia
has led to the unearthing of a Sydney
Gazette dated August 18, 1810. Its evi-
dence on the i point is: “On Monday last the
subscribers to the Sydney racecourse dined
together to celebrate the anniversary of his
Royal Highness the Prince of Wales’s birthday.
. . . .The races are fixed for Monday, October
15, and three plates of 50 guineas each will
be run during the week, exclusive of several
by-matches, subscriptions, etc. This estab-
lishment, altogether novel to this country,
bids fair to acquire eelebrity and success from
the judicious arrangements under which it
has been projected. .. .Lieutenant-Governor
O’Connell, Lieut. Wright and Mr. Wiliams are
the stewards-elect for the present year.” Mrs.
Macquarie was patroness of the races, and
as such her health was toasted at the festive
preliminary proceedings. But before that
there had been races at Parramatta: the first
of which this paper’s Oldest Inhabitant has
any record was between two horses, Belfast
and Parramatta. Parramatta won. That
meeting—April, 1810—was, however, a mixed
one, and included cockfighting and a wheel-
barrow race. The meeting held in Sydney,
and referred to in the above-mentioned clip-
ping from the Gazette, took place on what
is now Hyde Park. The big event —the Sub-
scribers’ Plate —was won by Chase. O’Con-
nell, mentioned above, was the principal race-
horse-owner of the period. He was commander of the
73rd Regiment.
Tommy Uren and Jack Clune clashed at
Sydney on Monday to decide the State lightweight
championship—a rather negative sort of distinction,
by the way, except among amateurs. Both men
had acquitted themselves well in previous disturb-
ances, Clune by outing Jimmy Hill, the feather-
weight premier, and Uren by giving the imported
Granwell a lesson. This time Clune found that
bouncing in and bounding away led to nothing but
trouble, because Uren bounded after .him with both
feet and smote him hard and often with both fists.
That played out Clune, and in the eleventh the towel
saved him from the final clout. The winner’s next
argument will probably be with Herb McCoy.
* * * *
Lightweight Herb McCoy disposed of Jack
Read with ease and comfort at Melbourne Stadium
on Saturday. The pair weighed in at level weights
(9st. 121 b.), but the advantages were all with
McCoy. Ikey Mo said, “I’ll lay theven to one on
McCoy,” and Ikey, as usual, knew something. In
the early rounds the affair might have been
described as a tango-fight, wherein the pair bunny-
hugged in approved Bowery style; but in the sixth
call to arms McCoy cut out the ragtime and seri-
ously clouted Read on the jaw. Read took an inter-
val of 9sec. on the deck to consider the problem.
As he hadn’t made any headway in- the matter in
the seventh round his lieutenants took a hand and
“skied the wipe,” as they say at Toolak.
**■«■*
Eugene Corri, the world-famous boxing
referee, in recalling some of his experiences recently,
opined that the greatest amateur heavyweight he had
known was John Hopley, of .Cambridge University,
a son of Judge Hopley, of Johannesburg. According
to Corri, this pile-driver could hit as hard as a horse
could kick, and had the amazing record of always
outing his opponent within three rounds. “Once he
hit so hard that his victim was nearly put to his
last sleep. So great was the difficulty in restoring
him to consciousness that Hopley walked about the
place like a demented man, and vowed that he would
never again enter the ring. He kept his word, and
from that day no more has been heard of Hopley’s
sledge-hammer blows.” A sleep-producing wallop is
a great asset, but it can be overdone.
Reichenbach’s cycling record between
Darwin and Adelaide, 28 days 7 minutes, was not
affected by J. E. Fahey’s recent onslaught upon it. The
Victorian rider had bad luck early in the proceed-
ings. He was six days getting to Daly Waters tele-
graph depot (407 miles) owing to break-downs. On
the ninth day he pedalled into Powell’s Creek depot,
about 5.63 miles from Darwin, in the teeth of a
gale. Before reaching Tennant’s Creek more break-
ages put an end to all hope of a record, and now any
further attempt by Fahey will have to wait until he
returns from the Front.
* * * *
The Stevenson-Gray billiard match, now
dragging its weary length along in London, is evi-
dently as genuine as Gray’s recent go with Inman,
which ended in the youngster’s defeat. This time,
although the stake is only £5O a side, there is an
arrangement that for every 100 points he is ahead
when he reaches the 18,000 limit the victor is to
get an extra fiver. In short, they are playing for
50 quid and shilling points. Last week Stevenson
had 1000 points to the g'ood, but in a trial of endur-
ance he is not quite an Inman. A run of bad luck
or a mighty break by Gray may put him out of
form. And what form it is -on both sides ! In one
evening Stevenson totted up a 428 and a 419, and
Gray got a run of 562.

Lindrum and Williams are putting in a
fortnight of billiards at Alcock’s Room (Melb.) as
an object-lesson for amateurs who have been doing
their little best in the winter tournaments.
The closing fight for Sydney baseball
premiership on Saturday had a delightful sparkle.
Waverley met Petersham; but Petersham must first
have met a cross-eyed Chinaman, it was so unlucky.
Left-hand pitcher Gillies Campbell (Petersham), who
lias twirled so ably during the season, went to rags
in the second innings, and Waverley pasted him for
three runs. That brought Harry Dean (right hand)
to the slab, and checked Waverley’s freshness, so
that it scheduled only one run in the remaining
seven innings. At the end of the sixth innings
Waverley was four and Petersham three; and so it
ended. The last three innings saw great work by
pitchers Alan Kippax (Waverley) and Dean (Peter-
sham), which beat up barrackers into one long howl
of excitement. Waverley’s success lifts them upon a
ledge beside Paddington and Leichhardt as holders
of two consecutive premierships.
* * * *
There are some hefty baseball snifters in
St. George (Sydney) district. In a match on
Saturday, Rockdale defeated Arncliffe with the
hurricane scores of 44 to 38. Rockdale scored two
abnormal innings of 15 and 12, while Arncliffe also
helped itself to an innings of 15. A rumor is
abroad that the bodies of both batteries had been
seen floating in George’s River soon after the tragic
performance.

Manly (N.S.W.) has been the scene of a
mild outburst of bushwhacking entertainment
lately ._ The latest performance was an underhand
chopping match for £lOO a-side and the champion-
ship of N. S. Wales, between Heckenberg (the
holder) and a local axeman named L. G. Mclntosh.
Fifteen-inch blocks were sculptured, and the title
changed hands. Mclntosh, axeman, was then put up
against Higgins and Scully, sawyers, and beat them
through a 12in. log. He was 26sec. on the journey.
But Heckenberg isn’t satisfied, and has been accom-
modated with another bet of £lOO for a return
match.
'At Shepparton (Vic.) they gunned spar-
rows for the championship of the Goulburn Valley
(open to the State) one day recently, and A. Quin-
lan, last year’s crack shot, was again the winner.
His tally was 19 kills out of 21.

A coincidence was the recent winning of
the swimming championship silver cup of the Roe-
dean School, Brighton (Eng.), by the youngest daugh-
ter of Dr. Chappie, M.P. for a Scottish seat, and
formerly an enthusiast in swimming circles in Maori-
land, She beat 450 competitors, and is the fourth
girl in the family to get away with the silverware.

The Canterbury (MX.) Jockey Club has
decided to give the whole of its net profit for the
year ending April 30 next to local Patriotic funds.
Average 'yearly profits are £4OOO, but if there is
a slump the club will pay a minimum of £2OOO.
Which is. much more sensible than howling wildly to
have racing wiped out altogether.

“Ah Gee’’: William 11. of England was
murdered. Henry 11., though great, was
full of misfortune. Edward 11. and Richard
11. were both deposed and assassinated.
Charles 11. was one of our most despicable
kings. James II died in exile. George 11.
was a nonentity. John 11. of France was
beaten at Cressy, captured at Poitiers, and
died a prisoner; Napoleon 11. never reigned;
Francis 11. reigned only one year. Philip
11. of Spain was defeated in the Armacfa
tight, lost the Netherlands, and finally died
a loathsome death; and Charles 11. was an
idiot. Abdul Hamid 11. of Turkey was de-
posed ; Catherine 11. of Russia, very great
and very wicked, was assassinated. So was
Alexander 11. of Russia. It isn’t a list
to give William 11. of Germany much com-
fort when he wakes up with cold feet at three
o’clock in the morning.

sence as a corrective of throat and voice
troubles. Concluding that where there
is so much public recommendation there
must be merit, I decided to put your pre-
paration to the test. In my case it has
done all. and even more, than was claim-
ed for it.
I understand Hean’s Essence was
placed on the market to enable thrifty
housewives to make up cheap cough mix-
ture for family use. Permit me to say.
much more has been accomplished, for a
real boon has been conferred on -singers,
actors, teachers, preachers, public speak-
ers, and others, who may suffer from re-
laxed vocal cords or from colds, causing
congestion of the throat.
Wishing you every success, yours faith-
fully, ALLEN DOONE.

Maoriland Public Trust Office. —This
is one of the most popular bits of Socialism
in Maoriland, and is going to be one of
the most influential. It offers to do all
sorts of work as trustee, executor, agent or
attorney. The principal executive officer
is the Public Trustee, who is now subject
to the directions of a Board consisting of
the Minister for Finance, the Public Trustee
himself, the Government Insurance Com-
missioner, the Valuer-General, and the
Superintendent of State Advances, with two
persons outside the public service and ap-
pointed by the Government. In addition to
the work commonly performed by a trustee
co. the office takes charge automatically
of all intestate estates, of mental patients’
estates where no “committee” is appointed,
and of various public sinking and pension
funds. By recent legislation it may also
act as a custodian trustee; that is to say,
where there are private trustees, it may
“hold the trust property, invest its funds,
and dispose of the assets as the private
tiustees in writing direct.”
The office is making continuous and rapid
progress. The estimated value of all estates
and accounts in hand has increased from
£7,358,947 in 1910 to £13.580,936 in this
present year. The principal movements
have been as follows :
1910. 1915.
Mills and trusts .. ..£2,803,724 £5,271,616
Intestate estates . . . . 385,755 698,674
Mental patients’ estates . . 395,642 570,561
Sinking funds . . . . 1,438,877 2,508,574
Pension funds . . . . 536,609 1,442,772
The private estates in hand have just upon
doubled in number in the five years. The
“custodian” business alluded to just now —
i.i which the Office acts chiefly as investor —
is growing, too. It started with £162,362
in 1913 and is up to £250,064 now. Of the
total value of I lie trusts and accounts, the
amount received in cash or converted into
cash and now under the Office’s direction
is £6,932,203. This, with £250,214 of re-
serves, is mainly in mortgages, £5,482,326;
public securities (mostly local bodies’ de-
bentures), £938,684; cash and deposits,
£445,471. The very small amount in Gov-
ernment securities is worth noting: it
amounts to less than 2 p.c. of the total
value of estates, etc., under administration.
The Office is in no sense of the word an
agency for raking in money for hard-up
Treasurers. With over £5.000,000 to lend
on mortgage, and with the available sum
always growing, the Office has become a
concern of great consequence throughout
rural Maoriland. which is mostly up to its
shaggy eyebrows in debt.
The Public Trust Office goes further than
the private trustee co., yet no further than
the private trustee may have to go yet, and
as a matter of fact no further than the
life insurance cos. go now. It guarantees
in certain cases not only the invested prin-
cipal but also interest. Rather, it under-
takes to pay a certain fixed rate of interest
on moneys made available for investment
at the discretion of the Public Trustee —
not more than 5 p.c. on the first £6OOO and
4| p.c. on the excess. Whatever income is
received over and above the guaranteed
amount belongs to the Office, though that is
a feature which will have to be reconsidered
some day. As remarked above, the life-in-
surance office with any share capital behind
it guarantees principal and interest, and
guarantees the interest for many years in
advance ; and. after doing all this, it retains
for itself only a Small proportion of any
profit it may make. The time will come
when this Office may find it feasible to do
the same thing. Hitherto it has been quite
wisely more concerned about building up a
reserve fund than anything else. This fund
has been furnished out of profits, which
have moved as follows :
1908 .. £9,640
1909 .. 10,851
1910 .. 11,739
1911 .. 11,241
1912 ..£25,920
1913 .. 27,551
1914 .. 29,222
1915 .. 32,508
The reserves total now £250,213. This
constitutes the capital, though, besides that,
the whole taxable resources of the Dominion
guarantee the integrity of the Office.
* *. *- *
A suggestion to write down capital was
trodden on by chairman Bright at the Boul-
der Perseverance meeting in London. In
reply to a shareholder who thought that
the time had arrived for the £l to be re-
duced to 2s. 6d., John Bright’s son said
that the Board failed to see what advan-
tage was to be gained. First of all it
would cost money to do it, and if the mine
was not going to last the expense was not
worth while. The subject was allowed to
drop.
* * * *
Poor prospects at depth and increasing
cost of mining supplies have for some time
been a thorn in Boulder Perseverance’s side,
and now comes the news that its days are
officially declared to be numbered. At the
annual, meeting in London the chairman
said the time was approaching when develop-
ment work would be abandoned and the
ore reserves drawn on. Since then the out-
look has. if anything, become worse, so the
thieatened stoppage of development may
occur even sooner than expected. Ore treat-
ment. however, can be carried on for a few
years, as apart from the reserves blocked out
there are upwards of 250,000 tons of broken
ore in the stopes.
* * * *
Molybdenite, wolfram, scheelite and. in
fact, all the ores yielding tungstic oxide or
acid so useful for hardening steel, are in
special demand at present. Latest cables
from London give the following prices per
ton: —Molybdenite. £700: wolfram. £300;
scheelite, £300; manganese. £7 10s. The
Gpyw-pment is requisitioning all
supplies in hand -”1 a ,P onule ores.
Only about 10 tons or molybdenite were
hitherto raised yearly in , ,; , j ( ‘ ( ‘ n . s hin(l and

Shareholder: Much obliged. You’re
something of a prevaricator, all the same, seeing
that it’s three years since that co. was discussed at
all.... Mick M.: Many a worse yarn than “Tomkin’s
Grey” has been printed. Try again. There’s room
for stories with “cocky” color in them. . . .8.R.:
Nothing in them ; clearly not your line. . . .Oliver O.:
You can get that information from one of the Govt,
departments. ~ .E. Pullman: Meaning of the native
word “Kooyong”—will somebody oblige?....Galena:
Sorry, but the Wild Cat doesn’t advise as to share
deals....Q. Dee: That sort of yarn calls for name
and place.... Billo: You can’t raise enough • steam
for the long pull up Parnassus. .. .J. 8.8,: Good idea
rather badly knocked about.... S.D.: You long to
crush her slender throat like the delicate stem of a
flower; but you only stand like a lumbering gout
when you visit your lady’s bower. Well, it’s kinder
than crushing her slender throat, or kicking her in
the ribs.... Will F.: Try it on your own State’s
weeklies. A manuscript can travel cheaply and
never suffers from corns. .. .F.G.S.: The point has
been made before. In any case the poem gets along
on wooden legs. .. .Elias E. : Amateurish handling of
an old theme.... Tam (V.): Pretty poor stuff....
A.R.K.: You won't sell 11s any of your creaky „
puns. .. .Tim: Can’t you curse better than that?. ... -
Isaac McP.: A poet should never scuffle. . . .G. 8.:
The weak point about your idea is that readers refuse
to sing their newspapers. A lot of them wouldn’t even
know the air you have built it on. . . .Tipperary
Mike: Not worth while- —and why didn’t you attach
your address ?.... Anti-German: Satire is about 11
months too late. . . .Morrie: Clumsy. . . .P.P. (V.):
Sincere but dull. .. .Bellerive: From the Front: —
.. . .W.11.R.: Not marketable here. . . .S.D.: We don’t
like Robert or the way he tramples on his tobacco....
All Gee: Not enough in the idea and we are not
keen on imitations. ...E.S.: Perhaps prose is your
proper vehicle. You can’t make a smooth passage
with the poetic ’bus, at any rate. . . .Nicodenms: Give
Omar a rest. .. .William B. : Doesn’t reach high-water
mark. . . .H.lt.C.: Verses sunk in action. .. . Jas.
P. McE.: It lacks originality.... Gus G.: Revelry
came to a dismal end. . . .C.F.8.: No, there's no
wise provision of that sort, though the Government
was invited by this paper to introduce it. How-
ever, there are other concessions unknown to the
Imperial loan. . . .W.J.G. : The fact that he refused
to do his duty as a citizen and particularly as a
minister of the Gospel and tell the police where
these horrors were taking place condemns him either
as untruthful or worse. It’s an unlovely choice
whichever way lie has it. . . .Barcoo: He has, but not
to the Front. .. .Mick Kelly: None.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
Spall: How and when did you invent your terrible
system of lead-pencil furrows? The drawing is as
weak as the gag. ~ .G.M.D.: Crude drawing, and the
humor is very pale. . . .W.H.8.: Scratchy every way.
We dislike most the Kanaka prisoner with the mouth
of a sulky fish.... Lionel S.: The worst-drawn Kaiser
we have seen yet T.J.H.: Heavens, how you must
have worked over it! You even invented a new sort
of ear for one ol the drinkers. And yet it fails....
A.L.D.: Can find no use for the mad lizard or the
ladylike Turk. .. .William F.: No, thanks. .. .Jeff :
Hard labor in pen and ink—the wrong ink. . . .H.F.:
Very elementary stuff.
Listen to the yell for. reform as you
announce that, so far as the causes of in-
sanity in N. S. Wales could be ascertained
on the “physical” side, intemperance in
drink headed the list in 1914. And now
listen to the dead silence as you announce
that venereal disease was second on the list.
Private Enterprise is hard at work sharp-
ening tools to cut its own claws, and it will
want to know what’s wrong presently when
it finds it can’t scratch like it used to. It
got butter up to a wholesale price of 2s. per
lb. in the places where the fat is produced,
while London was buying at 138 s. per cwt. —
Is. 23d. per lb. Simultaneously prime beef
was selling in Bananaland at 44d. per lb.
wholesale, while none could be had in Mel-
bourne at less than about double that figure.
But in dealing with that noxious weed or
thistle or whatever the law calls it, the
despised rabbit, P. Enterprise has achieved a
feat that must have surprised itself. It
sold them at 2s. per pair in Melbourne, while
it had no less than a solid million put away
in cool stores; and at the same time it was
poisoning them by the myriad in the country,
80,000 being polished off in the Colac district
in less than a month.
“John Drayman” gives three pairs of
Tasmanian brothers a send-off: —
A week or two ago a 19-year-old brother of Frank
Green, Clerk Assistant in the Tasmanian House of
Assembly, solemnly tossed a coin with his 24-year-old
senior to decide which of them should go to represent
the family at the Front. Frank lost, whereupon the
youngster fled joyously into camp. But Frank,
although married and a happy dad, heard duty per-
sistently calling him, and after a fortnight he gave
in and enlisted. “He’s a bit young to go out on
his own,” he drawled, by way of excuse. Andrew
Inglis Clark, the son of the late Judge Clark, and
member of the well-known Hobart legal firm of
Finlay, Watchorn and Clark, enlisted as a private
last week. His younger brother, architect Con
(Conway, after Moncure Conway, who was a guest
in the house of the Judge when the stork called
with the baby), is already introducing some of his
favorite American styles of architecture into the
bomb-proof burrows of Gaba Tepe or thereabouts.
Another Hobart pair of brothers to set sail for the
Great Scrap are Henry and Ernest Baker, who both
graduated as slap-up reporters on the Daily Post.
A year or so ago Henry left the permanent inky way
and studied for the law, passing brilliantly and
annexing several University degrees. These six-foot
lads, after enlistment, were suspected of concealing
special qualifications for medical jobs, and were
promptly commandeered by the A.M.C.
ON A THREAD.
Where the air is full of bullets
O’er the strewn and gory dead,
Back return the gallant soldiers
From where their lives hung on a thread ;
While the sentinels their vigil keep’eth
Thro’ the dark and silent night,
Wearily the soldiers sleep’eth
Till the glimpse of daylight;
Amidst the din and crash of battle
While recklessly they charge ahead
Merry jokes are passed among ’em
While their lives hang on a thread.

HORLICK’S
MALTED MILK
IN BANANA LAND
Mclntyre Bros., of Christmas Creek, bor : .

Handsome does!
Dusty, drought-stricken Charieville, in the
wild and woolly West, has sent 234 men to
the Front without counting quite a number of
Charlevillians who enlisted in Brisbane.
When one considers the size of Charleville
this record is probably unequalled in the
mainland of Australia.
Brisbane workers celebrated the change ol
Government with the biggest strike which has
occurred in Queensland since the 1912 Tram-
way trouble. In defiance of the Industrial
Peace Act 600 sewerage workers are out,
and it is an absolute certainty that not a
man among them will be punished for break-
ing the law.
A learned Queensland Judge, reminiscing
in court recently, recalled the happy, early
days when you went from Brisbane to Too-
woomba by coach and learnt the great truth
that the drunker your driver the better he
could drive. Now old Queenslanders are
sitting back in happy expectation of hear-
ing some of the old drivers revive a few of
their yarns about former passengers who
travelled with a wig in the boot. One at least
of them could give a glorious account of how
on a journey that was wetter than usual the
Judge followed the wig.
The £25,000 libel action which the
Courier people started against John Wren,
the new owner of the Mail, has been settled.
John’s paper says:—
We have made the fullest inquiries into the mat-
ters dealt with by us in the articles, and now confess
we are perfectly satisfied that all serious charges
against the Courier or its proprietors or any persons,
including the committee of the patriotic funds, were
a misrepresentation of facts, totally unfounded. We
unreservedly withdraw and regret having made them,
and sincerely apologise. As a manifestation of our
genuine retraction of the allegations, and by way
of further evidencing our belief in the honest
administration of the funds, we cheerfully contribute
£5OO to the Courier patriotic funds, for allocation
as the proprietors of the Courier think fit, and under-
take to pay all costs and expenses. "L
The large, comprehensive apology is to be
advertised in 22 newspapers, and by the
time he has seen the last of the notices John
of Collingwood will probably be satisfied
that it is one thing to run a tote and quite
another thing to run a printing press.
When four mules wept to tne Show :-h
All the stubbornness of Australia has not gone to
the Dardanelles. Some of it was at the Show op the
day of the big ring events. Two girls in the :front
row decided to stand up, and, maybe in a spirit of
mistaken chivalry, their male escort got upoiujhejr*-
hind legs also. Then arose agonised cries of “Sit
down! Sit down! For Gawd’s sake, sit down! ”
But the Almighty’s convenience (if that was
what was meant) was not considered. So the crowd-
tried sarcasm. That having no effect, the audience
proceeded to despatch munitions to the Front. Rotten
bananas, fruitskins packed into' paper bags, trampled
sandwiches and lumps of earth flew like hail. Most
of, it missed the enemy and drove surrounding
neutrals to fury. One man, purple with suppressed slan-
guage, turned round to threaten, when a shell struck
him in the eye and he dripped assorted dessert. By
this time the ring events were forgotten or over, and
it didn’t matter if the asinine quartette stood on its
collective head. So the crowd broke up and headed
for a long, cool beer. “Happy days!” it said, and
blew the froth into the eye of heaven.
It would be hard to find a fighting family
to beat the lieids, of Graceville. for coolness.
A recent cable told of an Australian who
placed a sack on a bomb that had fallen near
him, and then sat on the sack. He was lifted
a few feet in the air, but sustained no
damage. The man to do this was a Keid,
who has since, alas! been killed. Five sturdy
brothers are at Gallipoli to avenge him.
Brisbane is quite likely to introduce no-
class suburban trains long before other States
seriously think of them. Abolition of rail-
way “classes” has been the fad of a well-
known engineer who has done a heap of con-
struction work in Queensland, and, directly
and indirectly, he has infected thousands of
Brisbane people who otherwise would never
have given the thing a thought. Labor hav-
ing come into power, Adamson is being
bothered to introduce the levelling reform,
though the engineer before-mentioned was
always careful to say that, so far as he was
concerned, the question was purely one of
economics which might just as properly be
introduced by Fat as by Lean.

J. B. Hall, Bananaland's Under Sec. for
Justice, who died a few days ago, was a
Scot of Stirlingshire, who, coiping .into
Queensland 59 years ago, became a genuine
Brisbaneite —-he passed his whole subsequent
life in the city. At various times he was
Principal Receiver in Insolvency, Curator
of Intestate Estates and Insanity, and also
Official .Trustee. In matters of insolvency
hg-Avas the State’s greatest authority. Per-
■'Sonally he was urbane, precise, accurate
and eminently reliable; and he passed out at
the eariy age of 64 years with as few enemies
as an honest man can have.
From a well-known Queensland nursing
“sister” at Heliopolis:—•
It is interesting to watch the Arabs pruning date-
palms here. They have a rope round their waist and
against the tree; plant their feet against the palm,
lean forward and jerk the rope up the tree, then lean
back and climb with the feet. It almost looks like
running up the trunk.
Substitute vine for rope and Warrigal for
Arab, and you have an accurate description
of the way Black Brother of Queensland
shinned up his tree trunk in the early days.
Who was the original and who the plagiar-
ist?
I Bade Him Go.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The grey gulls scream and mock at me,
The garish day is nearly done,
The while I watch the lonely sea.
He’s dead ! Ah ! none so brave as he !
But as I mourn my soldier son,
The grey gulls scream and mock at me.
Is this the end? It must not be!
I dream his w r ork is but begun,
The while I watch the ionely sea.
With shining eyes lie made his plea.
I bade him go. The fight is won.
The grey gulls scream and mock at me!
My fettered life chafes to be free,
As blood-red dies the sullen sun,
The while I watch the lonely sea.
I loved him so ! So happy we!
Ah, now the sky grows drear and dun,
The grey gulls scream and mock at me
The while I watch the lonely sea.
QUEENSLAND.
NORMAN CAMPBELL.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
' Brisbane, August 21, 19i5.
My Dear Tiiargomindah,—
His Ex. has been ill all the week with
either a bad attack of the ’flu’ or a visit from
his old uncharitable enemy, malaria. All
vice-regal engagements were cancelled, and
thus it happened that neither the Governor
nor Lady Goold-Adams was present at what
turned out to be one of the most eventful
meetings of the Red Cress Society.
I hinted to you in a recent despatch that
in Brisbane the piping times of peace had
departed even from the serene atmosphere of
the Geneva flag. Since then the Cross execu-
tive has received a letter from Lady Goold-
Adams, stating that she could no longer work
with the secretary, Miss ‘Macansh, who, in
consequence, resigned. Miss Cecily Carter
also resigned. Almost every person at the
recent meeting openly eulogised Miss Macansh
and Miss Carter, but regretfully decided to
accept the resignations because “the Red
Cross Society must be the first considera-
tion.” Also, it appears that the constitution
of the society requires the Governor’s wife
to be the State president. So a new secre-
tary was appointed.
Several members of the committee then
drew attention to some more or less vague
remarks made by the Governor when he
accepted the position of patron, and it was
decided to invite him to “out with it.” A. H.
Whittingham, M.L.G., therefore headed a
deputation to the vice-regal stronghold, where
it was learned that his Ex. objected to cloth-
ing being sold at the Red Cross rooms.
Object! I should think so. The grieved
remarks of a member who explained that the
clothing was sold only to soldiers on their
way to the Front, and that a cheap rate was
charged, aggravates rather than smooths
over the miserable business. If this has been
going on for long it explains the repeated
irate statements which have appeared in
Tommy Kangaroo’s letters to the effect that,
having purchased socks, singlets, etc., he has
found tender messages attached from their
makers who had meant them as gifts.
This has been a hustling week for the
Y.W.C.A. Helen Barnes, organising secre-
tary for Australasia, is on the spot, and is
exuding energy in the interests of a fort-
night’s campaign to raise enough money to
hold ' the Y.W.C.A. fort against the Old
Enemy (who, incidentally, makes a poor
showing when compared with Schweinblud)
for another 12 months. Three garden-
parties and one luncheon foray have hap-
pened in Miss Barnes’s honor. The Mayoress
was responsible for one on Monday, Mrs.
Badger for another on Tuesday, and ex-
Speaker Cowley’s wife followed suit on
Friday. The luncheon broke the monotony
on Thursday.
The Brisbane Golf Club was gay and
optimistic to-day when the members held a
patriotic meeting. About a hundred visitors
took part in the proceedings, and, as a
recompense for their efforts on behalf of
their country, afternoon tea was spread on
the lawn amidst bowls of the most beautiful
sweet-peas and larkspur.
“High Jinks” and “The Girl on the Film”
have been the intellectual fare of the week
at His Majesty’s Theatre. The N. S. Wales
tennis players were entertained at theatre-
parties on Tuesday and Friday nights.
The inter-State tennis this week did not
cause much excitement. Wednesday was to
have been a feverish occasion, but as the vice-
regalities did not appear, the huge crowd that
was expected refused to roll up and pay
out its money for only half the ’show.
Rain was all against the Civil Service con-
cert in the Exhibition Hall; yet tickets went
off like hot cakes and honey, and sports and
concert brought in over £lOOO to the Patri-
otic Fund.
Dr. Andrew Menzies and Mrs. Menzies
returned a few days ago from the U.S.A.,
where the doctor had been polishing up his
dentistry. They found the majority of
Americans pro-Ally, bu;t far too busy with
baseball to bother much about the war.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
“They call men who have gone to the Dar-
danelles heroes ; I call them murderers.” For
this Charles Jackson, of Brisbane, received
a sentence of three months. But, prima
facie, isn’t it really n case for medical treat-
ment?
More reflection on the Queensland climate.
Higgs, M.H.R., asking about the Literary
Pensions Fund, discovered that, while 10
beneficiaries had died, not one of them was
a Queenslander: all the people of that State
who had ever drawn money were still draw-
ing it. However, the dependents of literary
men who haven’t stored up riches are not
costing the Commonwealth a mint of money.
The pensions have been operative for a good
many years now, and the total passed out to
June 30, 1915, was £4403 —about as much
as Australia pays for its Governors and
Parliaments and Black Rods every three
days.
A Queensland Minister, after a recent
protracted Cabinet meeting on the Lucinda,
explained why it took so long to make so
little progress with Bills —“You see, it’s all
finance, finance, finance.” Banquo’s ghost
at every Cabinet banquet!
Nobody doomed to hear the exposition of
the Income Tax Bill in the House of Reps,
regretted that, owing to Fisher’s poor
health, the job of introducing the measure
fell to Hughes. Fisher has a capacity for
making dull subjects yet more dull, but even
the income tax was not heavy enough to
crush Hughes’s impish spirit. “Billy” con-
fessed that the schedule relating to income
from property was beyond him, but the
Commonwealth Statistician had luminously
explained a certain difficulty by remarking
that it arose from a “a variation of the
curve of the second degree.” At another
stage Jokook cried with heavy irony: “Go
on, we understand apl about it!” “Then
you have the advantage of me!” was the
prompt reply.

IMPORTANT
Look to Your Teeth.
There are no teeth like those furnished by
Nature. For service, comfort, and good
health, artificial teeth cannot be com-
pared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly- try to pre-
serve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap
and water are. useful - , but are somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttle-
fish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.
EJJDENTA TOOTH PASTE is scientifi-
cally prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect
the mouth (thus preventing decay).

To Kill Roots of Superfluous Hair.
Women annoyed with disfiguring growths of
superfluous hair wish to know not merely how
to temporarily remove the hair, but how,., to
kill the hair-roots permanently. For this pur-
pose pure. powdered pheminol may be applied
directly to the objectionable hair-growth. The
recommended treatment is designed not only
to instantly remove the hair also, but to actu-
ally kill the roots so that the growth will not
return. About an ounce of pheminol, obtain-
able from the chemist, should be sufficient.
Rustrous Hair.
A simple lotion that can be made at home,
and which will positively force the hair to
grow, is within the reach of everybody. It
stops the hair from falling" out, clears the
scalp of dandruff, and leaves a clean, tingling
sensation which is a sure sign of healthy
action. Get from chemist one ounce of
boranium and mix it with J-pint of bay rum,
adding sufficient water to make a This
quantity will last you several weeks, and is at
the same time both effective and economical.
Removing Her Skin.
The quickest and surest way to make a
good complexion out of a bad one is to actu-
ally remove the thin veil of faded or dis-
colored outer skin from the face. This can be
done, easily, safely and privately by any
woman. The process is one of gentle absorp-
tion.
Clot seine pure mercolised wax from your
chemist, and apply it at night like cold, cream,
washing it off in the morning. In a-few days
the liter no Tide in the wax will have absorbed
the disfiguring cuticle, revealing the fresh
young skin underneath; you will have a beau-
tiful, clear, natural complexion. The process
is pleasant and harmless, making the face look
brilliantly attractive and youthful. It also
effectually removes such -blemishes as freckles,
fan, moth patches, liver espots. pimples, etc
Every woman should keep a little mercolised
wax on hand, as this simple, old-fashioned
remedy is the best complexion beautifier and
preserver known.
Blackheads Instantly Go.
A very simple, harmless and pleasant pro-
cess is now used to remove blackheads and
correct greasiness and large pores in the skin.
You have only to drop a tablet of stymol,
obtained from the chemist’s, into a glass of
hot water and bathe the face with the liquid
after the effervescence has subsided. The
blackheads will then come right off on the
towel. The enlarged pores immediately con-
tract to normal and the greasiness disappears,
leaving the skin smooth, soft and cool and
free from blemish. But to make sure that
this desirable result is permanent it is advis-
able - the treatment several times at
intervals of; say, about four or five days.
Grey Hair Unnecessary.
One need not resort to the very questionable
expedient of hair dye in order not to have
grey hair. The grey hair can easily be
; changed back to a natural color in a few days’
time merely by the appjication of a simple,
old-fashioned and perfectly harmless home-
made lotion. Procure from your chemist an
ounce of tammalite concentrate and mix it
with four ounces of bay rum. Apply this to
the hair a few times with a small sponge and
you will soon have the pleasure of seeing youi
grey hair gradually darkening to the desired
shade. The lotion is pleasant, not stieky o:
greasy, and does not injure the hair in an?
way.
Naturally Wavy Hair.
Good stallax not only makes the best possi
ble shampoo, but has the peculiar propert;
of leaving the hair with a pronounced natura.
“wave,” an effect presumably desired by many
ladies. A teaspoonful of the stallax granules,
dissolved in a cup of hot water, is ample for
a luxurious head wash, and leaves the hair
with a peculiar lustre and fluffiness obtainable
from nothing else as far as known. It
is perfectly harmless, and can be obtained
from most chemists, although since it has
been but little used for this purpose it comes
only in Jib. sealed original packages, enough
to make up 25 or 30 individual shampoos. * f 1

“0.K.”: How quiet Victoria is about the
effects of the new licensing law! Thus far
the "wider * distribution of cash is-hardly felt.
Nor is the improvement in public health, as
the result of a lessened consumption of
whisky and the earlier hour at which boozers
go to bed, yet perceptible. Further, the
reduction in the number of police cases, and
the diminution in the weekly sum-total of
domestic assaults, batteries, financial diffi-
culties and general entanglements, has not
been officially estimated. Also, the improve-
ment in the health of barmen and barmaids
needs more time for development. Nobody,
in fact, sees any striking change impelling
him to discuss the new Act excitedly—no-
body, that is, save groaning publicans and
early-morning thirsters on the one hand, and
joyous housewives in . the other. The hotel-
keepers have distressing revelations to make
—always in strict confidence. The takings
of city pubs at the principal street corners
have dropped £3O a day, and more'than that
in some instances. Quiet suburban licen-
sees are mourning the loss of their old
early-morning trade even more deeply than
they lament the loss of two hours of ill-
requited drudgery at night. Some of them
talk solemnly of “chucking the business,” as
though they fear it may suffer from the
chuck and are loth to hurt it. In due
course, no doubt, statistics will show how
many extra hundred pounds a day and
thousands a week are helping to make the
world happy instead of inebriated. Mean-
while anyone can note a slight falling off
in the supply of grog blossoms that bloom
in the spring, the breath of scandal is less
pronounced than it was two short months
ago, beer, stains are less in evidence, and the
once disreputable “drunks’ express” is now
politely alluded to as the “last train home.”
Altogether a reformation so gentle, so unob-
trusive, that it has come to stay, because it
will be firmly established before anybody can
stir up enough enthusiasm to try to violently
kick it out.
“Rag”: Let me dash to the help of my
countrymen who cry aloud for more muni-
tions. Gather me all the* “dead marines”
and fill them to the depth of four inches
with bullets. Now lower into each a slim
cartridge of gelignite with a cap and fuse,
fill up with more bullets and seal with clay or
pitch. As a grenade nothing could be
handier and, on the end of a cord, it can
be thrown at least 30 yards. Short of
refilling the “marine” with beer I don’t
knpw a better use for it.
The Imperial Inventions Committee, of
which Admiral Fisher is chairman, has been
supplied with particulars of an instrument
hammered-out of the head of a Melbourne
man, Charles Winter, and called a sub-
marine locater. It is a sort of submarine
telescope, consisting of a box containing
special lenses arranged to give a clear view
of the floor of the ocean through at least
100 feet of water. The primary idea is to
locate sunken mines or submarines; but it
sounds like the forerunner of a machine
that will enable submarines to be spotted at
considerably greater distances. When that
arrives the first row of the shark’s teeth
will be drawn.
“W.C-M.” : Now that the tariff has been
definitely shelved, discounts allowed by for-
eign manufacturers to • Australian importers
have suffered a unanimous slump. Discounts
are notified by cable, and so get in ahead of
the shipments ordered at the old prices. But
the importer doesn’t let the public have the
goods at the old price. Not much! He
keeps his clerks busy costing the goods to
arrive, perhaps two months hence, at the
new cabled prices, which show a rise of
perhaps 20 p.c. on the invoice prices. Then
lie not only pockets that difference, but also
defrauds the Customs of a nice little bit.
It is time this game was stopped, and duty
imposed on the price shown, irrespective
of trade discounts. An increase in tariff is
marked by an increase in trade discounts;
a decrease in tariff by a decrease in dis-
counts. Every way the consumer pays
through the nose, and the Australian manu-
facturer continues to be regarded as a thing
accursed.
George Smith, Tasmanian Railways-com-
missioner, at one time managed for a private
company in Westralia. He and the generous-
souled Westralian traffic-manager Neil
Douglas, recently deceased, were both after
the Tasmanian job, but Smith got it. That
Smith is alive and Douglas dead is nro-
hablv a mere matter of climate. No Tas-
manian railwav-commissioner ever dies of
anything but old age.
“Square Jane,” from Adelaide: —
As a mere woman who does her best to help
along. Australian industry I have worn cashmere
stockings made in Australia, and purchased in South
A us., for some time. On a visit to Sydney recently
I desired to buy a pair or so. In Pitt and George
streets I visited six shops, most of which, inciden-
tally, showed placards urging the passers-by to be
patriotic, but I was unable to obtain a single pair.
Worse; with one exception I was informed-that Aus-
tralian wool did not wear nearly so well as that made
somewhere (or anywhere) else. Had I not already proved
the wearing value of the wool no doubt I would have
been persuaded by the very repetition to stand in for
the foreign goods. What shoddy some of this so-
called patriotism is ! And what hope has Australian
industry got against such traders except through a
tariff , which will £er.ce them to handle either Aus-
tralian g«ods or r.one at all?

Neuralgia and Poor Blood.
There are very few cases of neuralgia that
are not caused by a thin, run-down condition
of the blood. Almost the first thing the
doctor looks for in neuralgic patients is the
anaemic appearance.
There are two things to do for any form
of neuralgia. Apply heat to the affected
part to soothe the pain, and feed the nerves
by taking a tonic containing the elements
needed by them. Heat as afforded by hot
flannel, iiot water bags, etc., lulls the in-
flame nerves into temporary quiet. It does
not cure. Not until the nutrition of the
nerves is restored will the inflammation
subside and the neuralgic state be remedied.
Never under any circumstances should drugs
to deaden the pain be used.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills furnish to the
blood the needed elements, and the blood
conveys them to the nerves. The only way
of getting food or medicine to the nerves is
through the blood. Remember that.
Neuralgia is a general term. It means in-
flammation of a nerve. It is given different
names according to the nerve affected.
Sciatica is neuralgia of the sciatic nerve.
Applications of heat will soothe the pain in
all forms of ' neuralgia, and Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills will correct the condition that
causes it.
If you have neuralgia you can send to
your dealer at once for a box of Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills. A useful booklet on “Diseases of
the Nervous System” will be sent free, to any
address by the Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co.,
Sydney.*
FREE SAMPLES OFFERED
Free samples of the new laxative, Pink-
ettes, containing sufficient to give it a satis-
factory trial, will be sent to any reader of
The Bulletin mentioning this paper and
sending name and address to the Dr.
Williams’ Medicine Co., Sydney.
Pinkettes will be found an excellent laxa-
tive combination, that should really help to
cure that dangerous condition known as
constipation. When they are taken accord-
ing to directions they are designed to cor-
rect the irregularity so that the patient will
not have to take an opening medicine day
after day. They are a- safe family medicine
because they contain no habit-creating/
drug; they are daintily got up; easily given
to children and they act thoroughly without
causing sickness and griping.*

Beautiful Hair and lots of it —If you use Crystolis.
Here’s good news at last for men and women
whose hair is falling', who are growing bald and
grey, whose scalps are covered with dandruff that
nothing seems to keep away, and whose heads itch
like mad.
Good news even for those who imagine themselves
hopelessly and incurably bald, or who suffer from
hair or scalp trouble of any kind.
We have had granted to us the sole Australasian
rights for the great American discovery, Crystolis,
the new hair remedy that in America and Europe has
been called the most wonderful scalp discovery of
the century, having been awarded Gold Medals at' the
big Paris and Brussels Expositions.
Hundreds of men and women have written us to
tell of the phenomenal results obtained by its use.
People who have been bald for years tell how they
now glory in their beautiful hair. Others who. have
had dandruff all their lives say they have now a
clean, healthy scalp and that hair stopped falling
after a few applications of this wonderful new
treatment.
We don’t care whether you are bothered with
falling hair, prematurely grey hair, matted hair,
brittle hair, or stringy hair; dandruff, itching scalp,
or any or all forms of hair trouble. We want you
to try “CRYSTOLIS” at our risk.
We give you a binding guarantee, without any
“strings” or red tape, that it won’t cost you a cent
if we do not prove to you that “Orvstolis” will do
all we claim for it—and, what’s important, we have
plenty of money to back our guarantee. We have
deposited £2OO in our local bank as a special fund
to be forfeited if we fail to comply with this con-
tract. Out out the coupon below, and post it to-
day to Creslo Laboratories, Dept. 200-U, Malcolm

Non-SRid Tyres.
For the hard road -for the hot pace—for the long
grind—for true economy and service .
The success of Firestone Tyres has proved that the motorist
can have comfort, safety and the ** most miles per shilling.”
Firestone Tyres are preferred because of highest quality at the least
cost —as the greatest value, even though there are “cheaper' l tyres.
The rubber in them is supremely good. It has the quality of greatest heat-
resistance, of greatest wear endurance. Every Firestone Tyre contains an extra quantity
of this extremely good rubber.
The Non-skid lettering is an imprint of safety. On every highway of the world it
challenges the need of other anti-skid safeguards. It holds the standard for endurance
and economy. The letters prevent spin or skid in any direction, they radiate the heat
of road friction, insure perfect traction with gasoline economy, car-protection and
comfort beyond contradiction.
Firestone Tyres are made by specialists in the largest
exclusive tyre factory in the world. This year’s Firestone
output has increased 78 per cent. Firestone are tyres of
greatest strength, sturdiness and safety—
for the Price of Only Ordinary Tyres.
Leading dealers everywhere endorse Firestone quality, and
motorists praise Firestone service.

Still another big' cargo-carrier foamed into
Port Phillip one recent day, and apologised
for being late —there had been another land-
slide in the Panama Canal. _ That gash cut
by engineers in the neck of America looks
so little like a “permanent work” that even
a borrowing Australian politician might
hesitate to call it by that name. A genuine
old-man earthquake, and we may see the
ships of the world once more wallowing
round Cape Horn, about whose permanency
there is no doubt whatever.
* * * *
“F.H.”: “Matey” (B. 5/S/’35) alleges
that Tasmanian hardwood "ties knots in it-
self and wriggles like a snake as soon as the
weather gets to it.” My house has been
built for three years. The weatherboards
are Tassy hardwood. The ceilings through-
out are made of four-inch hardwood, stained,
and they look at least as handsome as oak.
So far there are no knottings, warps or
wriggles anywhere, and the same statement
applies to two large out-buildings made of
the same class of weatherboard as the house.
It’s all in the seasoning. Surely “Matey”
will find it difficult to convince himself that
the leading Australian jamah-handling firm
is crazy because it also makes a specialty
of Tasmanian hardwood —for building pur-
poses. What is required for the Tasmanian
timber —and for all other Australian build-
ing timber, for that matter —is a Government
biand indicating adequate seasoning.
“Yannathera: Being an arch-optimist
Martin had refused to sell his sheep in the
early days of the drought, and later he
couldn’t. Ilis run was a jumbuck boneyard
when an offer reached him offering 14s. a
head for all the mutton he could supply.
Martin wired back : “The Almighty has fore-
closed on the lot in the wool.”
“Poon Boon” : I want to throw a stone at
“G.J.H.” (B. 29/7/T5) who, when referring
to the railway from Swan Hill (Vic.) to
Piangil, in the same State, writes: “If Hol-
man bridged the Murray at Tooleybuc—
which is across the border, opposite Piangil
—he would be committing the heinous
offence of diverting the trade of that district
from Sydney (nearly 700 miles away) to
Melbourne (about 140 miles away).” I
hold no brief for Holman; but the N.S.W.
Labor Government has at any rate done
more towards border railways than Liberals
ever did. It was under McGowen that the
13 miles of line between Finley and Tocum-
wal were constructed, giving the settlers in
that part of sßiverina a natural outlet for
their goods. Then again the Holman Govern-
ment recently arranged with the Victorian
Government for the construction of a line
from Moama to Moulamein. In any case, it
in absurd to say that the N. S. Wales Gov-
ernment is afraid of losing the trade of the
country immediately north of Tooleybuc, be-
cause it never had it to lose. What trade
there is always went to Melbourne, mostly
via Swan Hill-
* * * *
“Devilfish” : A totally new kind of cross-
bred apple has been produced at Premay-
dena (Tas.). The tree was a Rome Beauty
grafted on a Senator stock, and the apple
was exactly half and half, a dark-red Rome
Beauty on one side and a striped and
streaked yellowish-red Senator on the
other. There was no melting of the one
color into the other, but a sharp line divided
the two. If it had been cut in halves the
most expert pomologist would have pro-
nounced the one half a Rome Beauty and
the other a Senator.
* •* * *
Another bright example goes wrong in the
feet. About four years ago Wellington
(M.L.) decided to have a municipal fish-
market. The thing promised well; but the
old difficulty of distribution soon arose —
mostly the result of this country’s extra-
ordinary determination to have everything
landed on its kitchen doormat. So the enter-
prise degenerated into a joke with its collar
undone and its hat on crooked, and the
city’s Health Committee now says that -it
must be either radical reform or the dead-
house. The capacity of Public Enterprise to
make a mess of things appears to be rivalled
only by the ability of Private Enterprise to
produce the same article.
“Lou”: I worked once at a eucalyptus dis-
tillery, in a belt of mallee scrub east of Ray-
wood (Vic.). It employed about 30 hands,
and the process was simple. The leaf was
cut with sickles, carted in and dumped into
large wooden vats or tanks, and pressed
pretty tight. The receptacles were then made
airtight, steam was forced in, and the foliage
sweated a yellowish crude oil. The oil was
afterwards refined. The pure article is water-
white, and the older the better. There are
by-products, but they are so far unexploited.
The leaf most sought after for medicinal
purposes is the common blue mallee. and the
shoots or suckers that sprout on an old
stump sweat the best results. More oil is
now used in the flotation process for recov-
ering metals than for any other purpose;
and for this work the oil from what is com-
monly called the peppermint-gum is pre-
ferred.

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its accion is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

Can you recognise her
from this Picture?
She is one of the most popular, as well as
one of the most beautiful, young ladies in
Australia. She has sent us her picture and
the following testimonial, and to the first
hundred persons who can recognise her from
this picture and send us her name, we will
send gratis, one full-size tablet of Rexona
Skin and Facial Soap (not a sample). So write
us to-day, if you recognise her, and be one
of the lucky hundred. Address your letters
to the Rexona Proprietary Company, 15
O’Connell Street, Sydney, and remember that
if you want more than one tablet of Rexona
Soap the price is 1/- per tablet, from any
Chemist, or post free upon receipt of the
price.
This is her letter to us: —
I cannot understand
why anyone should use a
skin food or face cream
when Rexona Soap
answers the purpose of
both so well. I have
found it simply delightful
to the skin, and as a
shampoo for the hair it
is truly wonderful.
I shall recommend it to
all my girl friends, and I
wish Rexona every suc-

OH, was it dream, or was it trance,
Or was it I was there, .
And saw the sickly sunlight dance
On steel-starred Sari Bair?
“Al-Allah!” through the battle smoke
Shrilled loud the Moslem cry,
And where the Crescent phalanx broke
Death’s ruddy stream ran high.
And “God for England!” fierce I prayed,
And “Allah for his own”
Prayed each behind the grisly blade
That stripped an English bone.
Oh. fear for him and pride of hirn!
Oh, love that slew despair!
Ye bore me swift as swallows skim
That day on Sari Bair!
Yea, heel and spur that clips the heel,
We clove that hiving swarm;
Where reddest ran his leaping steel,
I nerved his flagging arm!
Nor tigress of the jungled dark
With young beside her knee
Knew love so fierce or hate so stark
As burned the soul of me.
They struck; they fell; to Heaven assigned,
Their fighting souls flew free. . . .
I heard the sound of a rushing wind,
And the cry of the Banshee.
A hand of ice was at my throat,
A black mist on my brain;
He lurched, and even as they smote
I heard the call again!
I shrieked his name unto the skies,
Nor answer came to me,
But a flitting flame before my eyes
And the cry of the Banshee.
*■ * *
Oh, was it dream, or was it trance,
Or was it I was there
And saw Hell’s host of devils dance
On bloody Sari Bair?
And he? Alive? Nay, read again!
Before my frenzied eyes
I see him where the huddled slain
Sleep under Asian skies!
Not dead? Not dead? —O God of love
Who hast delivered me,
Stretch still Thy conquering arm above
Shell-torn Gallipoli!
The night watch pales to dawn of joy,
To rose has turned the rue;
An alien mother mourns the boy
My victor’s bayonet slew !
VICTORIA.

Willie’s Cemetery.
[For The Bulletin.]
A GREAT characther ’n’ all, the same
Willie Hogan,” said Flynn. “He has
long kep’ the cimmethry here, dig-
gin’ the graves whin graves was called fev.
’n’ tendin’ the dead fer a trifle iv five shillin’
a head paid quartherly.
“’Tis not an office iv great profit Willie
have ez head-warder ’n’ chief engineer iv the
cimmethry et Paddyswhack be reason iv the
fact ’tis customary fer the residents t’ remairx
alive to an extent onprecidented in histhry.
People would die twice a wake ilsewhere is
obshtinately tenacious iv life in Paddyswhack
’n’ vicinity, ’n’ Willie might be sittin,
out all weathers a month iv Sundays n
never a corpse come by, one way ’r the other.
“Willie is proud iv his cimmethry, fer all
that, ’n’ takes fine care wid the graves, dig-
gin’, ’n’ thrimmin’, ’n’ tittyvatin’ the same
wid all sorts iv conthrivin’. There’s nothin,
Willie wouldn’t decorate a grave wid, ’n’
never an oysther-shell is waste in Paddys-
whack, nor a fisli-tin navther, ’n all tlie
pebbles is gathered fer a mile round.
“Wan grave, the last shleepm place iv
Willie’s own poor mother —rest her soul -is
ornament wid ould horse-shoes, wove
pathern. Lar-r-ge draught horse-shoes n
small pony shoes is co-mingled graceful t
proiuce effects at wance artistic, ’n novel.
Yi’d come a great way t’ see it, I m thinkin .
“‘’Tis fer gold luck!’ sez Willie Hogan.
‘The sainted Ma was niver wan concerned
hersilf wid the care ’n’ holy upkeep iv her
soul whin livin’, ’n’ savin’ a small Mass
nothin’ could I do b’yond layin a lib ral sup-
ply iv horse-shoes to her grave fer luck. Ive
wan huntherd ’n’ ten ould horse-shoes fencin
her grave, ’n’ will that not bring her good
fortune Hereafther there’s no ha’porth iv
sense in omens ’r symbols ’r tokens at all,
Sos “Ould Tim Winter’s grave Hogan decorate
wid tin-lids. Ye’re thinkin’ wan tin-lid have
great ’n’ mar-r-ked similarity to annother
tin-lid. ’Tis a common impression. Till ye ve
seen Tim Winter’s sacred mound ye 11 never
drame iv the tremenjis divarsity iv tin-lids.
They’re all there, lids iv every tm ever was,
wove t’ rare designs wid amazin’ ingenuity, n
vet not widout jue decorum. Willie have a pro-
per sinse iv his sacred juties, n do he thnm
a grave wid brace buckles ’tis not irreverent
nor lightly conthrived. Willie Hogan would
scor-rn t’ do the like, givin him all credit.
“Dan Heeley’s grave is filegantly friscoed
wid cow-bells. Would annother man think
iv cow-bells ez decorations fer a grave evei .
‘N’ there’s Willie have conthrived it wid
tnar-rked success, ten bells up wan side the
head-slitone —which is iv red gum n _ ten
bells down the other side, most judicious,
wid wan big bell in the cinthre adjacent to
‘Rest in Peace,’ V six-’n’-thirty bells iv
manny sizes set to a design on Dan’s earthly

“Mary Kelly’s grave is done wid shmall
shells contributed be friends V relations
helped out wid thrifles iv the rhind iv the
lobsther. There! ’Tis in yer mind the lob-
sther’s a beetle wid a loose character n a
reppytation fer keepin’ late hours n loose
company, ’n’ never wan a man iv taste n
iudgmint would inthrojuce t’ the solemn
adornment iv a tomb ; but I’d have yeh know
’tis a nate, decoratif crather is the lobsther
in the hands iv an ar-r-tist iv tact the like
Iv me friend Willie Hogan ; n’ Mary # Kelly
have a char-rming grave upholstered in two
colors, the tones iv red, which is the nut. iv
the lobsther, bein’ intherjnced wid tellin
effect would bring ciirious people iv distinc-
tion miles t’ look at it.
“ ’Tis an impossibility, sez you, t do the
grave iv a Christian wid wire nails in a
manner will not cause the judicious t gneve,
’n’ ye’re wrong, so ye are. Willie Hogan have
inlaid the grave iv Tom Costello wid wire
nails ’n’ others of the species, ’n ye d see
nothin’ finer be wan iv the ould masthers.
Tom Costello was a carpenther in the flesh,
so ’twas appropriate n’ in orther t fresco
his grave wid nails. First, _ Willie covered
the grave wid a nate slilab iv har-rd wood,
then he mapped in his head an illoquent in-
scription, wid floral ador-rnmints, ’n’ he
wor-rked it out wid nails druv in the plank.
Wan year ’n’ wan month was Hogan doin’
it, ’n’ there’s no man dead have a finer head-
shtone to his name than the late Thomas
Costello, Lor-r-d love him.
“ ’N’ wan grave is decorate wid bullocks -
hor-r-ns, ’n’ wan more wid the ribs iv sheep,
’n’ illegant they are did yeh care t’ dthrop
in t’ Willie’s cimmethry anny day ’n’ look
over the same. Complimented he’d be, ’n’
glad t’ p’int out his masterpieces, him wul
the pride iv a true ar-r-tist.
“I’m tellin’ yeh most iv this is done fer
the joy iv the doin’, mor-r-tal endin’s t’ acci-
dents ’n’ ailmints being few. ’n’ far-r bechune
at Paddyswhack. Aven whin wan do die the
beraved relatives is soon gettin’ over the im-
pulse t’ pay fer the care ’n’ keep iv a fine
grave fer disased. But Willie works on, con-
soled wid the conviction there’s not annother
cimmethry in the six Shtates wid the same
variety iv inth’rest. ‘l’m wor-rkin’ fer fame,’
sez he. ‘Postlierity will honor me name,’ he
sez. ‘N’ contint am I t’ kape me cimme-
thry so ’twill be a glory to me in all the
ages ?’
“ ’N’ mighty jealous he was iv any inter-
ference wid his cimmethry. He put a sthrong
fince to it, ’n’ shooed off the goats, ’n’ then
Danyil McKenny died. Did annother man
die no wan would be bether pleased than
Willie Hogan ; but Willie is out of patience
wid McKenny, ’n’ is for refusin’ him dacent
buryin’ in Paddyswhack cimmethry. Man
alive,’ says he, ‘we’re a Godfearin com-
munity, ’n’ Home Rulers to a man, n
McKenny’s nayther.’ . . ,
“ ‘l’ll not admit him t’ me cimmethry, sez
Willie Hogan, whin the toime come, holdm
up the fun’ral at the gate, him wid a shovel
to his hand, too. ‘ ’Tis fer the buryin iv
thim iv the true faith,’ sez he. Go yer
’way,’ sez he; ‘me people woulcln t stnanci

“But Willie Hogan was over-ruled be

Paddyswhack cimmethry; n afther that
Willie is gloomy ’n’ distressed. Wherever
ye’d meet wid him he’s thro win out hints
there’s nothin’ iv peace ’n God s comfort left

Man Overboard.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE engineers’ steward raced up from
aft, yelling excitedly.
“What’s that? What’s that,
roared the second mate from the mess-room
d °°Man’ overboard, sir!” bellowed the
steward. . „ ,
The officer rushed out of the alleyway and
hurried up the boat-deck ladder, blowing his
whistle as he ran.
“Who was it?” said the bos n, emerging
from No. 3 hatch. .
“I dunno,” replied the steward, staring
over the rail as the steamer began to swing
round. “All I see was a ’ead bobbin’ in the
wake ’bout quarter of a mile astern. I see
’im wave ’is arm a couple of times. ’
The omission of boat-drill from the rou-
tine, combined w 7 ith the effect of successive
applications of paint, had almost cemented
the boats into their chocks, and the. seamen
worked themselves into a perspiring and
blasphemous passion over the resultant im-
mobility. Eventually, after the unknown
had been in the water for nearly an hour,
one boat was chopped free with an axe. It
was lowered, and the second mate was over-
whelmed by the frenzied volunteers. The
lamp-trimmer, posted in the mizzen rigging,
signalled directions to the outgoing boat,

ACCIDENTS are always happening in the
kitchen, in the dining=room, in tne garden,
at the children’s play, and during every kind
of work or athletic pursuit.
Directly Zam=Buk is applied to a wound or
sore it serves to alleviate the pain and
inflammation, reduce any swelling, and
prevent the place “taking bad ways.”
Zam=Buk also has splendid antiseptic
properties.
In a natural way belonging to the
natural extracts from which it is
manufactured, this balm stops
the growth of harmful microbes
that account for the festering
of a neglected or wrongly
treated sore, it kills or nul =
lifies all dangerous influ-
ence at once, and causes
the tissues, which it
has first made clean
in a medical sense,
to knit together
once more until
all trace of the
sore or injury
has gone.
Zam=Buk is
the ideal
healer for
daily
home
use.

Rusty Nail.
Poisoned Foot Healed.
Mrs. M. Delion, who lives
at 53 Little Albion Street,
Surry Hills. Sydney, says:
“One (lay whilst crossing the
yard I slipped, and a rusty
nail penetrated my and
caused a painful ' jury. Within
a few days blood-poisoning set
in, and my foot and leg began to
be extremely inflamed and swollen.
Night after night I would lie awake
in agony, and often the pain made me
cry out aloud. For some time I was
too crippled to get about, or do anything.
After reading about Zam-Buk I sent for
a large pot of the balm. I began to apply
dressings of Zam-Buk to the injury twice
daily, and it soon effected a noticeable im-
provement. My foot was freed of pain, the
swelling and inflammation were greatly reduced,
and the wound began to look a lot healthier.
“I persevered with Zam-Buk until the wound was
thoroughly rid of all had matter, and then it healed
rapidly and perfectly. I cannot speak too highly
of Zam-Buk.”
For everyday skin sores, flesh wounds and injuries, Zam-
Buk is a reliable healer to keep always handy. Of all
chemists and storekeepers, at 1/6 and 3/6 per pot.

and with stentorian shouts kept the watch-
ing crew on the after-deck well informed of
current progress.
They’ve got ’im !’’ he suddenly roared ex-
ultantly, and a yell of appreciation echoed
up from the rail-lining men.
As the boat approached, with a limp fig-
ure resting against the second’s shoulder in
the stern, the seamen made an enthusiastic
rush to man the falls. Five minutes later
the rescued man was being hauled inboard
in a bos’n’s chair. Several injections of
whisky soon straightened him up and he
was. left to sleep off the chill of the South
Pacific. The vociferous enthusiasm of the
crew seemed to give way to an air of depres-
sion, and strangely enough the collective
facial expression was one of almost criminal
disappointment.
Three days afterwards the steamer arrived
in Hobart.
A reporter, after being informed by
the rescued man of the recent incident, has-
tened to interview the alarm-giving steward,
lie found the steward in his bunk and
almost hidden from view by blankets.
“....and the chief officer gave you some
recognition of your smartness, I believeV”
concluded the reporter.
The steward pulled down his blankets and
exposed two blackened eyes and a bandaged
head. “Yes," he grunted. “’E gimme ten bob

Scene: The Temple of the Ages. Vast clouds hang
low under the domed roof, and frequent lightnings
flash, but there is a glare of white sunshine on the
porch beyond. The clouds occasionally break and
reveal portions of the magnificent arabesques on
the walls of the building, and through the mists that
creep over the richly-tiled floor dim forms are seen
huddled together in shapeless masses. As each voice
is heard the figure of the speaker is seen for a
moment with startling distinctness.
OICES, wailing: Oli! Oh! Oh! Woe

Voices, triumphant: The night passes; the

Ultimo and White Bay Power Houses, in addition to which we have
orders on hand for the insulating throughout of Perth, Melbourne

Should further argument be necessary, we append the comparative
