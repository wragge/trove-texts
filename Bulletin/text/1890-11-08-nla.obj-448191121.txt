Registered by the Medical Board of N.S.W. ; Late
House Surgeon to the Great Northern Hospital, London.
Specialist for the Treatment of Diseases
OF THE
Reproductive Organs and Nervous Complaints.
WHY I ADVERTISE.
I advertise because I consider it necessary that people
suffering from Nervous, Sexual and Chronic Complaints,
should be able to ascertain which
DULY-QUALIFIED PRACTITIONERS
make these Diseases a speciality, particularly as, under
the present law, any person can call himself Doctor or
Professor, whether he is entitled to do so or not; and these
persons exist, chiefly, because Duly Qualified Prac-
titioners have not occupied the field.
Dr. PERRY invites the fullest investigation into his
credentials, and gives his Personal Consideration to
bach Case, and in all cases tells the Patient the exact
nature of his complaint, the cost of a cure, and the time
it will take.
Dr. PERRY’S experience in the treatment of these
Diseases has been so varied and extensive, that he is able
to tell absolutely whether the case is curable or not, and
therefore is willing to
ò
Guarantee to CURE EVERY CASE he Undertakes.
VARICOCELE quickly and successfully treated without operation. DIABETES and TUMOURS treated by a
totally new method of Cutaneous Medication.
8®” Send for Dr. PERRY’S Work on Diseases of the Reproductive Organs, Diabetes, Tumours, Skin Diseases,
etc., containing many simple directions as to SELF-MANAGEMENT, the observance of which is, in many oases,
sufficient to place the Patient in a healthy state. All who are in any way affected should procure this work, and
thus have the benefit of his advice and experience. FREE ON APHLICATION.

THE WAY TO WEALTH.
The way to wealth is as plain as the way to market.
The majority of the wealthy men of Sydney, Melbourne
and Brisbane made their money by buying land in these
capital cities while it was low in price, and before these
cities were so large and populous as at present.
■W estern. Australia
is the coming colony. Her Capital City will become
a second Melbourne or Sydney.

OF THE
EYE,EAR, NOSE,
THROAT &c.
Diseases of the eye, ear, nose and throat
of a difficult and complicated character have
been cured by
Dr. G. H. RAYMOND,
The Eminent
Botanic Physician, Specialist & Medical Writer,
Even after the leading specialists and general physicians
and surgeons of England and the Colonies had experi-
mented in vain. A pamphlet of testimonials, opinions of
the press, and elaborate dissertations will be sent on
receipt of a penny stamp. Works acknowledged by the
Princess of Wales. Address-
-62 Wynyard-Square, Sydney-
A few opinions of the (Queensland Newspapers concern-
ing Dr. RAYMOND’S skill and Treatment
“This gentleman, after a stay of some four months in
Blackall, has returned to Clermont, where, on a prior
visit, he performed some clever auricular and ocular cures.
During Dr. Raymond's stay in Blackall he has performed
several grand cures, especially with the eye, and we wish
him success wherever he goes. In eye complaints the
Professor is perfectly at home; his treatment is simple,
decisive, effectual and lasting.” Western Champion
Blackall, Queensland, 1885.
“ We can vouch for a number of his cures, as the
patients have presented themselves several times to us for
inspection, and we believe that they are very lucky to be
able to see at all. The Professor is certainly a wonderful
man.’’— Norman Chronicle, Northern Queensland, 1885.
“ Prom personal knowledge, as well as abundant testi-
mony, we are in a position to state that Professor Ray-
mond has effected some marvellous cures.”— lluoiik.ndon
Ension, North-Western Queensland, 1885.
“We have seen several testimonials to Professor Ray-
mond's skill from well-known people in the town and dis-
trict.”— Daily Bulletin, Townsville.
“ His many permanent cures of very difficult, and in
some instances almost hopeless cases, have been vert
favourably commented on by the whole press, both in the
southern and northern portions of the colony.”— Cook-
town Courier, 1885.

No diseases cause so much misery and distress as those

Suffering from the results of early follies or ex-
cesses, indigestion, foul mouth, costiveness, palpi-

specks before the eyes, giddiness, weakened
memory, pains in the back and chest, varicocele,
diseases of the bladder, kidneys, or liver, rheuma-
tism, impure blood, weakening discharges, impaired

and thorough investigation of their nature, dis-
covered the safest treatment for their permanent
cure. Persons residing at a distance may be treated
at their own homes, without any interruption to

SM ORJi CERTIFICATE. —One of Thousands more.
Noble-street, Newton, Geelong,
10th December, 1888.
To 11. F. IvyoKLMANx, Esq.
Dear Sir,—This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. / consulted
more than one doctor, and during that time took a areal
quantity of medicine without it doing me the slightest
good, but I became worse every day, wasting a wag' until
I became a perfect skeleton. About February last 1 began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I
was expectorating every day, I became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. 1 agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. At the
end of three months I was taken bad one morning, and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time I commenced to improve, and
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, I am as well as ever.
P. KEENAN.

Justices of the Peace, for the Southern Bailiwick in the

This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to Mi
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY" YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.

though you be perfectly well its general inform-
lion and prescription may assist you in restoring
some poor friend to health even after his case has
been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tendant.
ONE POUND IS SUFFICIENT TO
SEND
for Remedies necessary for the cure of NER-
VOUS DEBILIT Y. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
gerous, it would be advisable for you to sit down
quietly in your chamber and write to the doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. He will
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
oponion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, send for his famous medical
work, the price of which is but sixpence ; enclosed
in the volume will be found a list of carefully-pre-
pared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
Dr. Richards uses nothing but the purest remedies,
and never prescribes mercury under any circum-
stances. The moment letters are carefully per-
used and answered they are destroyed by Are,
and patients may rest assured that their cases
will remain a secret between the doctor and
themselves. Dr. Richards has successfully treated
nearly 25,000 cases since coming to Australia, and
has permission from at least 10,000 persons to
show their written evidence of his success. All

“ You have given me life and living .**
Colonel Mapleson writes as follows:—‘‘Madame Roze
recognises in your preparation the precious Saline that
she found so invaluable when she visited New Orleans
during the last yellow fever epidemic, in order, by her
concerts, to raise funds for the benefit of the stricken
ones, who could not afford the necessary comforts, and
which the crowded hospitals were unable to supply to
thousands of applicants. Madame Roze was advised by
Dr. Barnes, of London, to take your Saline with her, and
we took several dozen bottles. I really believe it saved
oob lives.

Acts as a Gentle but Effectual Restorative ; Allaying all
tendency to Feverishness ; Invigorating the Digestion.
Acting on the Liver, Bow'els and Kidneys imperceptibly
but surely ; tranquillising the Nervous System, inducing
wholesome appetite and recuperating the brain power.
Its utility as a remedy in fevers, and as a cooling drink
in diseases of children, such as scarlet fever, measles, &c,,
has been testified to by the leading members of the
profession. May be had of all Chemists in glass-stoppered

DESCRIPTION.
The Platter or Bowl, marked
B, is the receptacle for holding
11b. of butter.
The Cover, marked A, is filled
with water at the top; as this
evaporates through the porous
cover, it produces a great degree
of cold, making the butter quite
HARD and FIRM during the
HOTTEST WEATHER.
OUR INSTRUCTIONS FOR
USE.
Soak the whole of the Butter
Cooler in clean water for twenty-
four hours. The butter can then
be placed in the dish marked B,
at the same time filling the hole
in the top with cold water.
The water must be replenished
from time to time as necessary,
but the whole cooler need only
be soaked once.

SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 1890.
Exit Carington.
The retirement of Baron Cakington from
the Governorship of New South Wales, pro-
duced what the Sydney daily sup-Press tries
to put on record as a series of spontaneous
outbursts of esteem, loyalty and affection.
He was balled and banqueted, dinnered and
wined, speeched and sung to. Churches and
theatres, orphan-asylums and night refuges,
sporting clubs, literary clubs, and clubs with-
out either energy for sport, or desire for
literature, metaphorically prostrated them-
selves before him, and in their several ways
paid homage to him. His departure from
Government House was a pageant. Sixteen
guns saluted from the Inner Domain. The
carriage-way was strewn with flowers. The
carriage which bore himself and his wife
was a moving flower-stall. Brigades of
cyclists wheeled in front; cavalry, equipped as
lancers, played escort; volunteers, engineers,
artillery, naval forces, mounted infantry, staff
corps, cadet corps, and numerous other
branches enthusiastically assisted. Windows,
balconies, and streets were crammed with
miscellaneous throngs. Cheers and music
alternately drowned one another’s uproar,
and as the train carried oft' the ex-guberna-
torial pair, a clamour of exclamation filled
the air.
* * #
Now, in sober earnest, what is the signifi-
cance of it all ? Is it to be taken that
the sincerity of the homage was equal to
its volume ? Is it to be taken that if
even a small portion of the homage was
sincere that portion was gained by the lofty
exercise of any high power either of Lord
Caßinoton’s head or of his heart? As an
English “ nobleman,” representing Royalty
in Australia, he possessed a ready-made
entourage, but that entourage stands pre-
pared to transfer the best of all it gave to
him to any man, similarly accredited, who
may succeed him. With it go the men in
red and the men in brown, the men of the
flashing sabres and those of the gleaming
brasses, the sleek-faced functionaries and
powdered officials, the politicians who
climbed eminences for a parting view, and
the swarms of husbands and matrons who
frequent Government House with designs of
ulterior personal or family aggrandisement.
Some of these worship Royalty or its simu-
lacrum as a present means of living. They
must bear the- sabre, or blow the bugle, or
spur the horse, or start the cheers. They
are the servitors of existing authority, and
if the Crown were smashed up and the Throne
burnt to-morrow their enthusiastic service
would be purchaseable by the reddest-capped
incendiary who might mount to the place of
pay. Of the rest, almost all give worship, if not
also for pay one way or another, then because
of frailty. Their opera-bouffe conception
of human life has stripped manhood and
womanhood of natural grace and dignity
and in their places has put fantastic socia
tricks of segregation and isolation, for the
cultivation and perpetuation of which palaces
of gilded idleness and inept brain-work must
be maintained. Take away those who worship
for pay, present or prospective, and those
who worship because they mistake theatrical
social transformation-scenes for the splen-
dours of existence, and how numerous are
Caring ton’s special crowd of worshippers ?
# # #
He has, still, worshippers, it must be
granted. He played his Australian life to
that end and was not wholly a failure. With
a familiarity which in a free country partook
much of the character of an insolence he
entered into half the houses in the land.
No catastrophe was too appalling to suggest
to him reserve. The widow whose husband
lay stark before her had her hand seized by
the peripatetic intruder ; the husband who
tried to cover his face so that his tears should
not be witnessed by those standing around
the corp cs of wife and child, had a hand
pulled away from his eyes and wagged up
and down in gubernatorial condolence. If a
mine collapsed and entombed the workers the
Baron inflicted his sympathetic presence by
immediate despatch, and if a mattress caught
fire in the factory of a cheap drapery
store he was there beside the burn-
ing horsehair with an equally lugubrious
countenance and an equally fervent pressure
of the fat palm of the suffering soft-goods-
man. W hen flood-waters threatened an in-
land village he got there and squeezed the
hands of the homeless inhabitants and helped
things generally by pushing the steam-engine
with the tips of his Ungers, and when a foot-
baller was kicked in the stomach he was
there with his carriage to carry the heavy-
limbed youth to his obscure home. If a
baby was drowned in a tub of water he
electrically dispatched his sympathy to the
mother, if he could not make an immediate
raid on her himself ; and if a newspaper-
office took fire he corkscrewed himself
through the crowd and picking the tufty-
headed proprietor out played pump-handle
with him to the edification of standers-by
and the gratification of copy-seeking re-
porters, Indeed, newspapers were his choice
children. For those of them that lay down
flat and let Government House walk over
their columns he displayed a large and
generous appreciation. He gave their
editors to know that they were the equals
and in some respects the superiors of old-
world editors, and that if they could run
away any time from their desks and drop in
informally upon him his delight would be
unbounded. This was not amiability thrown
away. If he gave £5 to a starving
family the metropolitan papers emblazoned
the item, and it was echoed and re-
echoed and re-printed around the land
until it became £5OO, If he attended
a school-picnic or cricket-match, a sheaf of
notebooks were ready to receive his golden
commonplaces. However platitudinous his
remarks, the columns were never too full to
give him space. Practically, he was accepted
as a deadhead self-advertiser. Deduct those
influenced by this flagrant lord-worship of
the metropolitan Press, and the crowds that
lined the streets and filled balconies and
windows will be largely cut into, as they
would be when the Barnumesque tricks and
devices of any other self-advertising, would-
be hero are laid bare to public gaze.

After all these deductions, the balance is
small. But can it be said that even this
balance worshipped because of Carington’s
lofty qualities of head or heart ? In the
sphere of the latter the showman instinct
preponderated, as we have seen. It ex-
hibited the bizarre incongruities, ludicrous
inconsequentialities and unconscious anti-
climaxes into which a man, eternally
efforting to make a splash, must frequently
ignominiously fall. But in the sphere of
head—we defy any man in Australia to say
that a weaker-headed Governor ever ruled
over New South Wales. There stands to
his credit not one evidence of conspicuous
mental power, not one evidence of innate
insight into the needs of a oreat occasion,
not one symptom of touch with a law that
lasts longer than written law. And he had
his opportunity ! Burning like a brand of
shame upon the face of his administration is
the flagrant national outrage perpetrated by
him, in his capacity of Governor and
Queen’s representative, when the four
Mount Rennie youths—all under twenty
years of age—were swung from the gallows
in Darlinghurst Gaol. His utterly puerile
conception of the conditions under which the
power reposed in him should be exercised
robs the Royal prerogative of mercy for ever
of respect in these Southern (Hands. He, a
mere political stripling, a stranger to our
skies and shores, allowed the massacre of
these boys when the experience of the
country, the knowledge of the country, and
the sane virtue of the country implored that
the death-sentence should be commuted to
imprisonment. Cahington had not the
brains to see that the honour of the
country, the justice of the country, the
reputation of the Grown, were involved ;
his intellect only went the length of show-
ing him that the distinctly mandatory
words in which the Royal Prerogative was
robed admitted of the exercise of some
form of discretion, and quibbling through
these words he directed his discretion to
the “ popular ” course—a course made
popular by the lies and suppressions of an
institution upon which lie ever kept his eye.
Mr. Dallky, P.C., warned Gov. Carington
of the monstrous error which would be
committed if the Royal Prerogative were
not exercised. That eminent barrister
declared, not hurriedly, but after going
through, the case and all its surroundings
minutely from start to finish, that the execu-
tion of the youths would be a crime against
the Constitution, and that Parliament, in
authorising the Criminal Code under which
they were sentenced, never meant its pro-
visions to apply to such a case as that in
hand. He pointed out that only in the
darkest days of Irish history was a trial con-
ducted as Judge Wi.ndeyer had conducted
the trial of those youths. He contended
that counsel and jury should both have
refused to proceed with the trial in the cir-
cumstances in which they were placed.
* * *
This article we mean principally for
English readers, amongst whom Baron
Carington will no doubt now strive to
pose as an ideal administrator of Aus-
tralian affairs, and we, therefore, are com-
pelled tj repeat a few facts already known
to our other readers. Barrister O’Mara,
who defended one of the prisoners, wrote
directly to the Governor, pleading that for
his part he had been driven to exhaustion by
the manner in which the trial had been con-
ducted. As an example, the jurymen had
been kept in the box for (with five hours’
intermission) thirty-eight consecutive hours
on the two last days and nights of the
hearing—that is, from 9 a.m. on Friday
to 4 a.m. on Saturday, and again from
9 a.m. on Saturday till past 11 on Saturday
night ! The foreman of the jury admitted
that they hurried to a verdict as one of the
jurymen was breaking down ; and it was
also known that had they delayed longer
over their verdict they would have been
locked up till the next Monday. It is to
those incidents Dalley referred when he
spoke of the darkest hours of Irish history.
It was as a lawyer, as well as a statesman
and an adviser of the Queen, that he implored
the application of the Royal Prerogative.
But Carington, the man who knew nothing
about Australia or her legislation, but
held the Prerogative in his keeping, acted
as the weak man desiring a reputation for
strength uniformly acts, and instead of reason-
ing out his position clearly, snapped down on
his royal possession. Sir Henry Parke,s also
implored the exercise of the Royal Preroga-
tive. He declared that the execution of the
youths would be a terrible mistake, and con-
cluded that in the interests of the country,
and on grounds of public policy their lives
should be spared. Others also spoke, but
Carington thought himself in a crisis when,
with the daily Press with him, and, as he
foolishly fancied the great body of the public,
he was safe to exhibit a firm hand. He had
a confused Executive at his side, in a broil of
personal jealousies, and about equally divided
on the merits of the case, and as no voice for
remission came from that quarter he locked
the Prerogative up and prepared to sign
the death-warrants. But he did not sign
all the warrants. At the last minute he
exercised the Prerogative in the cases of two
and signed for the other four. Why he did
it for two and not for all is to the present
day, on serious grounds, a mystery. Sir
Henry Parkes had said that there could
not be a reprieve of one without a reprieve
of all, and that if an execution took place
the voice of the country would m the future
condemn it as a national crime. Parkes’
prophecy had not long to wait. On the very
morning of the execution, but too late of
course for Carington to see the turn of the
tide, the Sydney Morning Herald, which
had been in favour of Carington making the
law take its course, published a leading
article in which it said “ that there was no
knowing why two were reprieved,” and
further on that “ no case had been heard of in
modern times in which English judges had
compelled juries in criminal cases involving life
and death to sit all through the night in spite
of repeated protests and requests for adjourn-
ment,”
* • •
There was an opportunity which comes to
a man seldom more than once in a life and
his conduct in presence of which is the touch-
stone of his character ! Had Lord Caring-
ton, fresh from the founts of British Justice,
been an intelligent observer of legal pro-
cesses in British law-courts, he would have
recoiled, with Dalley, from the judicial
behaviour which “ had no parallel outside
the darkest period of Irish history.” But
he had not been an intelligent observer, or
his brain was unfit to weigh the com-
parison ; otherwise he would have made the
method of the trial a sufficient reason,
as it was, from the standpoint of
any man of head and heart, for the
exercise of clemency. The very confusion
and division of voices among his Executive
would, too, have been a reason. The re-
commendation to mercy unanimously made
by the jury would have been a reason. The
assurance of one of the ablest and most
responsible of the legal parliamentarians
who helped to make the law, that Parlia-
ment never intended the capital sentence to
apply to cases of the description referred to,
would have strengthened the arm of mercy.
But Carington stood stone-deaf to reason,
with a death-grip of his prerogative and
a show of firmness which was but a weak-
ling’s obstinacy. He goes now to England,
with testimonials from mere society hangers-
on, and the vapid and vain ; but with the
Royal Prerogative dyed with needlessly-shed
blood, and its prestige irrecoverably ruined
in National Australian eyes. Had ho had
the sense of a man—not to talk of the
wisdom of a statesman—he would in these
times of threatened Imperial disintegration
have, at the expense of all other popularity
if need be, held high the bright ideal of
ideal British justice, and have shielded with
the prerogative of the Queen whom he repre-
sented the victims of a prosecution s 0
obviously barbarous and so much at variance
with the sentiments of civilised humanity
as expressed in the criminal laws of Eng-
land and of every other country undominated
by the laws and prejudices of a convict-time
residuum. That—and not a record of dancing
and pleasantly dawdling with the fashion-
able, the self-serving and the bilious—
would have inspired the democracy of the
South with a thrill of admiration for the
institutions of the North. Had Governor
Carington used his prerogative, thereby
smashing a Ministry and ruining a Judge, he
might have experienced some trouble. But
law, logic, humanity, would have all been on
his side, and he would have left Australia
regarded as a strong and truly noble Eng-
lishman possessed of a stern sense of the
right of all men to a fair and impartial trial
according to both the letter and the spirit of
British law. Lord Carington is a man with
a hard heart and a soft head. That is the
sort of idol which is worshipped by society.
The Coming Confiscation.
Dear Bulletin, —One of the striking charac-
teristics of the Australian is his tendency
to form himself into an association on the
smallest pretext, and appoint a president
and a secretary, and draw up a volu-
minous report, and thereupon start out in
pursuit of some undefined object which he
neither hopes nor desires to overtake, partly
because he has no distinct impressions regard-
ing its identity, and partly because he has no
idea what to do with it. The chief business of
the association is, therefore, to hire an office
and to nominate a sub-committee, and the duty
of the sub-committee is to look into some hazy
and unspecified sub-section of the original
problem, and to announce the result of its
investigations. The Australian Single - Tax
League has already done all these things, and,
as usual, the result is practically nil. The
Land Nationalisation movement has degenerated
into a Freetrade propaganda, and as the Free-
trade party is pre-eminently the party of Land-
lordism, it follows that the great upheaval,
which was to wipe the last landlord off the face
of this continent, is now an advertising boom
for the mighty proprietor Burdekin and others
of his kind. As for the lofty cause which is
the only excuse or apology for the League’s
existence, it is only a matter of theory and
hazy speculation ; and no solitary member of
the Single-Tax Association, or of the ring of
self-seeking traders who use the Association
to rush the sale of their cheap calicoes and
their imported pants, has ever offered one prac-
tical suggestion which promises to bring the
social millennium any nearer. The lam! is one
day to belong to the people, but how the people
are to recover the land no one attempts to
decide, and a band of reformers who dare not
face the one initial difficulty of then- own
boasted reform are of no more use to the world
than the buried kings of ancient Israel. Even
the apostle of the new faith broke down
ignommiously on this cardinal point of his own
doctrine. He demonstrated eloquently enough
that the earth belonged by right to all its
inhabitants, and that its usurpation by a
handful of oligarchs was an outrage upon human
freedom, but the means by which this ancient
wrong was to be repaired he left an unknown
quantity. The choice lay between confiscation
and compensation, and as he dared not openly
commit himself to either, Ids new religion was
left unfinished. And his professed followers
have never ventured to supply this deficiency,
for which reason the Single-Tax League is now
an aimless, purposeless body, which draws up
reports about nothing, and files them away in
oblivion.
• * «
When Henry George refused either to
advocate the recovery of the land by the sum-
mary process of confiscation, or its reclamation
by purchase, he opened the way for a third
alternative: —that the whole scheme on which
the prophet’s fame and fortune were built was
merely a sham and an imposture, and an adver-
tising dodge of the meanest type. And when
the landlords and land-stealers of Sydney met
together to dine and drink and fraternise with
the iconoclast who had threatened their down-
fall, they had already recognised that he was
only an empty weapon after all. For if the land
is to be bought back by the people for the
people’s use, on the system of re-purchase
which prevails now -whenever Government
wants to re-acquire private land, then the
landlord, who runs the Government and
greases the machine of State, will him-
self conduct the sale and assess the com-
pensation, and the empty inland deserts
which were given away in the early days of
Australian settlement will suddenly rise to
fabulous prices, and dismal mountain ranges
will assume the value of suburban allotments,
and slimy swamps will undergo a boom, and the
beginning of land nationalisation will also be
the beginning of national insolvency. The
country has already had some' experience, in a
limited degree, of the landlord’s ravening hunger
after compensation. When a few inches of soil
arc wanted for railway extension then the barren
paddock which was offered the day before in the
open market for £5O, is suddenly inflated to
£2OOO, with an additional £5OO for “ deprecia-
tion” of adjoining land, and £lOO more for
damage done toa certain post-and-rail fence which
is claimed to be worth its weight in gold; and yet
the results thus arrived at by one landlord arc
only a feeble effort of arithmetic compared to
the stupendous bill which would be totted
up by all the landlords of Australia, met
together to sell out at their own estimate to a
long-suffering nation. The farewell banquet
which the monopolists of Sydney tendered to
their alleged enemy was but a feeble expression

' notion, and the new iniquity under justice and
would be twice as costly and
Tfunous as the old iniquity of fraud and
monopoly and universal wrong.
* * *
In the face of this dilemma Mr. George pro-
duced a new and emasculated edition of his
old doctrine, and tried to strike a balance
between the effusive landlord who had taken
bim in the one hand, and the people to whom
he had promised a gospel and a revelation on
the other, After denouncing for years the in-
justice of private ownership of land and calling
for the restoration of the natural rights of man-
kind, he resolved that the injustice—so far as
it had gone —must be allowed to remain, and
that the rights of mankind should slide. The
land as it stands to-day, is to be the
property of the landlord as before; there
is to be no nationalisation after all, and only
the future increment is to belong to the nation.
But unhappily, there trill be no future increment.
So long as land is a commodity for private pur-
chase and sale and barter and exchange its
price will be merely what it will fetch in the
market, and nothing more. The city allotment
which is valued at £lOOO on the day when the
new system comes into force will be sold at
£lOOO fifty years afterwards, for if any surplus
over that amount is to go to the State the land-
owner will have no desire to obtain a surplus.
The patch of ground which is now rented at
£5O will continue to be rented at £5O. The
annual value of the buildings or other improve-
ments upon it will no doubt undergo a tremen-
dous increase, for these will be strictly private
property, and the tenant will be fleeced by the
new method to exactly the same extent as he
was under the old ; but the increment which is
the property of the nation will not suffice to pay
for the working of the Act in which the great
reform is embodied. And the reason of this is
plain and easy of comprehension. An oligarchy
of landlords rules Australia, not by force of
numbers but Ivy unblushing corruption, and so
long as this oligarchy exists every law which
upholds the interests of the people at the ex-
pense of the landlord will be dexterously evaded
and set aside. To abolish monopoly Ivy statute,
and at the same time to leave the administration
of that statute in the hands of the monopolist,
is too hopeless and imbecile a scheme to deserve
serious consideration. The Foreign-trade pro-
prietors who whooped for Henry George
appreciated it at. its full value, and expressed
their gratification accordingly.
* * #
Therefore, I come back to the old alterna-
tive and advocate it boldly ; the one alternative
is Confiscation of the land—Confiscation in its
baldest, widest, most unvarnished, and most
remorseless shape. It is over this alternative
that the philanthropic landlord has waxed most
elocpvent, and, as he dwelt on its iniquity, he
has grown flabby with pathos and damp with
unshed tears. The cause which aroused his
sympathies was not his own, but that of the
struggling selector, who went forth in the early
days to do battle with Nature in her dreariest
and least inviting aspect, and his grief at the
prospective loss of his own vast estates, gained
by fraud and chicanery rather than by honest
toil, was swallowed up by his grief at the
spoliation of the industrious masses. He drew
a moving picture of this weary agriculturist
labouring for a scanty subsistence in some dusty
desert beside the Lachlan or the Darling, and
1 emanded justice on his behalf. He sketched
us forlorn surroundings—the old log residence
with a ramshackle door hanging dejectedly by
one solitary hinge, the solitary laughing-jackass
mooning on a blighted tree, the post-and-rail
ence which straddled wearily over the eternal
P am, the hashed tin and the damaged pannikin
< eposited on a stump beside the gate ; and he
pointed out to his hearers that the stay and
support of the country hung out in that unin-
uing residence, and demanded in burning
mugnation if the men who had endured hard-
S ’P s * u °h as these in order that the desert
nig it be turned into a garden should be plun-
Jr P tbra old age by the Huns and Vandals

has created improvements upon it, and thereby
given it a new and greatly enhanced value.
The former of these will be confiscated to the
nation, and when the freehold has been ex-
changed for a leasehold, and most of the other
fiscal burdens removed, the plundered agricul-
turist will be a decided gainer by the exchange.
l>ut the destruction of the old monopoly of the
soil will fall heavily on the fatted absentee and
the millionaire proprietor—on the men who are
landlords and nothing more, who neither toil,
nor spin, nor produce anything which benefits
their fellow-men—on the class whose one busi-
ness is to gather in rents, and whose one
anxiety is to pile up the insufferable load of
their exactions. The professional landlord is
the only individual whose interests are seriously
menaced, and it is for the country to consider
whether he has ever done anything to deserve
consideration at his hands.
* # *
The Freetrade party in New South Wales
has seized upon the Land Nationalisation pro-
paganda as something exclusively its own,
under the pretext that the imposition of pro-
tective duties is essentially inconsistent with
the spirit of the movement, and having thus
borrowed the ignorant disciples of George’s
philosophy it has used them as an instrument to
carry out one half of the programme, and has
let the other half severely alone. In other
words, assisted by the votes of George’s
followers, it has successfully extinguished
local industries for the security of its
importing monopoly, and has left the masses, as
before, to bear the burden of taxation while the
landlord continues to go free. And in one
respect these softgoods apostles are correct in
their assertions : Protection certainly is incon-
sistent with the Single-Tax movement, but with
the Land Nationalisation movement it as cer-
tainly is not. The imposition of a protective
tariff combined with the abolition of land-
lordism may accidentally produce a larger
revenue than is required for the purposes of
Government, as these purposes are now under-
stood, but if so it will be only another step
upon the road of national progress. The whole
policy of modern statesmanship consists in
borrowing money and leaving the result to
futurity, and if the combination of Protection
and land-reform open a way for the extinction
of this insane method of finance there will be
abundant cause for gratitude. When the
accumulating surplus in the Treasury has made
Australia independent of the loan-mongers of
London, when it has abolished poverty by a
system of national insurance which will provide
for the old age of every citizen, and for his
children after Ids death, when it has constructed
railways and roads throughout the continent,
and reformed the foul-smelling cities where
typhoid and diphtheria accumulate, then it will
I>e time enough to raise the question of exces-
sive taxation. And then, if the Treasury is
still overflowing, the Government can be turned
into a dividend-paying concern, and distribute
a bonus of 10 per cent, among a people who
have hitherto paid much and received nothing,
and who would gladly welcome a temporary
reversal of the ancient conditions.— Titus Salt.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Kindly Offer.
The Morning Post, the favourite organ of
British Toryism and military incapacity, has
lately given birth to a new idea in which the
loyal Australian native will, no doubt, be
interested. For many years past the difficulty
of finding recruits for the British army has
been steadily on the increase. Glory, accom-
panied by beggary and a wooden leg, and the
prospect of a weary old age in the workhouse,
fails somehow to attract the incipient warrior,
and consequently the old “Shook of Gamp-
ridge ” presides over a dismal array of skeleton
battalions and paper regiments of dismounted
foot cavalry and unhorsed hussars, and every
year the forces grow smaller and beautifully
less. Under these circumstances, the Post
considers that the rampant loyalty of the
“Representative Australian” might be con-
veniently turned to account. The fatted
absentee, who lives on his rents and spends his
“ h ’’-less old age in making a painful exhibition
of himself for the benefit of “ sassiety,” is con-
spicuous for his devotion to the Crown, and as
his country has made a fearful ass of itself
before every titled individual who has visited
its shores, it is naturally assumed that this
escaped K.C.M.G. fairly represents the popular
sentiment of the nation. Hence the following
suggestion :—
Let some distinguished British regiment be quartered
in Melbourne or Sydney, and recruited from the ranks of
the stalwart Australian natives, who are far superior in
physique and soldierly qualities to the young men
enlisted at home.
This proposal, and a lot of military drivel which
accompanies it, open up a new prospect for the
“native.” Australia suffers a good deal from
attacks of martial fervour, but as yet it has
seen nothing of actual war. Its great super-
fluity of colonels and other veterans have never
experienced the joys of campaigning in some
tropical land of cholera and swamps, and
marching wearily -up interminable hills
under the weight of fifty pounds of bag-
gage in search of an invisible enemy, and
dragging over endless plains of dust and finding
nothing, and dining on bark and grass and old
tough jackal because the commissariat has
broken down, and trailing dejectedly through
eternal wildernesses in order to wipe out a
hostile Power, which consists of one dirt-caked
nigger far beyond the distant horizon. The
Australian has, unhappily, missed all these
things, and he knows nothing of the joys of
serving his beloved sovereign for one shilling a
day and a pound of bread and three-quarters of
a pound of meat, with two shirts and three
pairs of socks thrown in every seven years,
while he pays for his own underclothing, and is
charged £1 for a “sea-kit,” and is subject to
“stoppages” for tea, coffee, vegetables, salt,
pepper, milk, and sugar, and has to find his
own plate and basin, and to clean out the bar-
racks with his own soap, and to pay for library
and medical attendance, and other sundries. It
is of things like these that military glory is
compounded, but the poets who sing of war
somehow leave them out. About twice in a cen-
tury the British soldier gets a chance to have
both his legs shot off under circumstances which
live for ages in the history of his country, after
which he spends the rest of his life on crutches,
begging for coppers and being run in for
vagrancy; but in between these bursts of
glorious excitement and thrill there are long
years and years during which he scrubs floors
and brushes boots, and is an ignominious beast
of burden in a barrack on a net income of two-
pence a day and remarkably little to eat. He
has no scope for outbreaks of magnificent
heroism, and Ids patriotic fire is employed in
cleaning out the regimental dust-bin. But as
glory—especially of this order—doesn’t amount
to much unless accompanied by victuals, the
Australian has no desire to take a hand. Plain,
ordinary grub may be a subject for earth-bound
souls to contemplate, but still it is more im-
portant than fame, and it is better to have
steak and potatoes regularly than to be em-
balmed in verse and dead-broke. And, there-
fore, speaking on behalf of the “ stalwart
native,” the magnanimous offer of the Morning
Post is hereby declined with thanks.

Want of Confidence.
Last week a simultaneous vote of want of confi-
dence was moved in the New South Wales and
Victorian legislatures, and the old, weary
struggle between the men who hold office and
salary, and the men who want to hold both,
started afresh. In the Sydney Assembly, how-
ever, there is at least a definite principle
involved ; each party has a distinct fiscal policy,
and there is an important issue before the
nation ; but in the Parliament at Melbourne it
is only a question whether the old incapables
shall shuffie aimlessly along as before, or
whether the new incapables shall shuffle along
in their stead. There is no principle to be
discussed, for neither party has a principle—
there is no policy, for both parties have the same
policy, and it amounts to nothing. For fully
ten years the Victorian Legislature has drivelled
wearily over small parochial squabbles, and has
shirked every question which threatened to be
of the slightest use to humanity. Parliaments
have come and gone, and new Parliaments
have come in their stead, and crumbled
away in their turn by the incurable dry-rot of
commonplace stupidity, and still the same old
politicians have pounded out the same theories
of straw with a dismal iteration which has
neither beginning nor end. When a general
election takes place the nation merely drops its
ballot-paper in the slot and the figure moves its
jaw as before. The tremendous social struggle
which is going on throughout Australia woke
one bald-headed member from his apathy, but
when he endeavoured to arouse a passing
interest in the question the House drifted into
the refreshment-room and left him alone. The
great Federation debate which opened the
session died a natural death, because nobody
cared whether Australia was federated or not.
The national finances suddenly fell to pieces,
and the Legislature let them fall, and was too
exhausted or indifferent to pick up the fragments.
When the Assembly passed a series of resolutions
raising the pay of the railway employes the
Government drifted serenely on its way, and
took no notice ; and when it protested against
the infamous management, of the railways the
Government raised the salary of the person who
is responsible for the general muddlement, and
again nobody paid any attention. Some half-
dozen motions of censure were cast upon the
dead sea of politics, and were found again after
many days when everybody had forgotten their
existence. And now that the Gillies Ministry
are dead, the consequences remain about the
same.

Imprisonment for Debt.
Every now and then people are wakened up by
hearing of some unhappy individual who has
been arrested and confined for inability to pay
a paltry debt, and who has been left to rot and
moulder within the walls of a gaol until the
world has forgotten his existence, and he, in
his turn, has forgotten the existence of the
world, and on these occasion the Legislature
generally gives way to a little passing excite-
ment—-and does nothing. The matter, appar-
ently, lies outside the sphere of practical
politics; in other words, there is nothing in it
to steal, or blaspheme about, or to enable
one member to call another a liar, and
nobody can get a railway built on the
strength of it, or sell his ground to the
Government for eleven times its value. And as
these are the only matters which the Legisla-
tures really care about it naturally follows that
Mr. Bibbs’ motion in the New South Wales
Parliament for the abolition of this
ancient infamy was ignominiously shelved, and
the Bill which the Pahkes Government under-
took to introduce in its stead is postponed,
apparently, till the Greek Kalends. The law
of imprisonment for debt is supported by the
united force of Capital, for it enables the
capitalist to wreak a mean revenge on his
enemy as no other statute could do. It is a
scheme under which a citizen can be confined
indefinitely without a trial or a hearing of any
kind, and under its influence poverty is a more
fatal crime than forgery or assault with violence.
No one, of course, is shut up because he
is unable to pay a debt, for the law is
based on Christian principles, and to sentence
a man to imprisonment—perhaps for life—
because he is without money would be as
impious as to hang him for the same cause ; he
is merely sliut up for “ contempt ” till he pays
the debt, but despite t he glamour of hypocrisy
thus thrown over the proceeding, the result,
somehow, is exactly the same. No one is ever
enabled, through being shut up, to settle a
liability which he was unable to liquidate while
he was at large ; it would be as rational to hope
that flogging would serve as a cure for baldness,
or to chain up a black man with a view to mak-
ing him white. The measure is not in-
tended as a remedy for indebtedness, for
even the Law recognises the fact that
a man in gaol is much less able to pay his
liabilities than a man at liberty ; neither is it
meant as a punishment, for the code does not
acknowledge financial embarrassment as a
felony ; it is merely an unconstitutional act of
personal revenge which the usurer is allowed to
exercise upon his victim, and a partial survival
of the old system of slavery, under which the
debtor became the personal property of tile
creditor, to lie sold or otherwise dealt with at
his discretion, ft is one of those legal pitfalls
which serve to entrap the poor ignor-
ant ; the unscrupulous speculator whose debts
amount to tens of thousands lias never been im-
prisoned for debt within the memory of man, and
the wealthy swindler who will come under the
operation of this law is still unborn. The man
who drags out years in a debtors’ gaol Is
generally some foolish individual who failed
to realise in time that it was much cheaper to
steal £IO,OOO and be esteemed for ever after-
wards than to make an honest endeavour to pay
£2O and fail in the attempt. His liabilities, as
a rule, are a mere trifle, for a man who under-
stands the art of owing large sums of money
invariably hires a brainy lawyer to see him
through Ins difficulties, and gets his discharge
without paying anybody. He is also, in most
cases, a well-meaning and idiotically honour-
able individual, whose Christian stupidity pre-
vented him departing with all his available
assets for regions unknown. And his fate serves
as a solemn warning to men who have hitherto
attempted to be honest on a small, unobtrusive
scale, and have suffered from a morbid craving
to keep square with the world, whereas they
ought to have borrowed in an oily way from
everybody under the sun and floated bills all
over the habitable globe, and then cursed their
creditors from bed-time to breakfast.

“The proposition of the N.S.W. Attorney-
General,” says the S.M. Herald, “ to provide
legal assistance for pauper prisoners is so indis-
putably right in principle that the only wonder
is that it was not made long ago.” The reform
is, apart from the Attorney-General and his
colleagues, solely and wholly due to The Bul-
letin, which has for years past used the case of
every undefended but rigorously-prosecuted
citizen to advocate the necessity of this socialistic
measure. The Sydney Morning Herald
applauds the innovation— hut, it has never
advocated it ! Whatever is, is right according
to the S.M. Herald. It was right all through
the 50 years during which the S.M. Herald has
been in existence as a daily paper, to allow the
penniless pauper accuse to face his doom, some-
times with absolutely no one to say a word for
him or cross-examine the witnesses against him,
while under the most favourable circumstances
he had to depend on the gratuitous advo-
cacy, undertaken perhaps at half-an-hour’s
notice, of some stammering, well-intentioned
boy, or hopeless legal dead-beat. Now it
is right that the pauper should be pro-
perly defended at State expense ! We do
not often care to publicly claim credit for big
reforms of which we have sown the seeds, but
cannot help pointing out that we lately drew
attention to the disgracefully tardy provision
made for the defence of the murderer, Smidt,
and that the week immediately prior to the
announcement that State funds would, when-
ever necessary, in future be available for the
defence of capitally-arraigned prisoners, we
remarked upon the fact that an undefended
man had that week been tried for his life at
Darlinghurst, and notified on i intention of
thereafter invariably taking steps to collect
funds for all capitally-arraigned undefended
prisoners unless the State should come to the
rescue. The State has come to the rescue, and
the act is one for which every lover of humanity
and equal justice to all men will from the
bottom of his heart thank the Parkes Ministry.
Henry Varley, the alleged evangelist, take*
up his cross and testifies against the sinfulness
of Democracy and Trades Unionism ;
I observe that the lowering of entrance fees to the re
spective unions is taking place, and forbearance with
non-unionists advocated in order to the rapid absorption
of all workers into the ranks of trades unions. I trust
that these efforts will not succeed. The result could only
be a colossal monopoly, at once exacting, tyrannous, anil
oppressive.
Just so. When Unionism has combined all the
workers in one compact body then a gigantic
monopoly will be formed consisting of the entire
nation, and as the evangelist only appreciates a
monopoly when it is made up of a few capita-
lists he feels mad accordingly. A monopoly,
as he justly observes, is always tyrannous,
when it can find anybody to tyrannise over,
therefore the existing monopoly of land-
sharks, importers, landlords, and syndicates
tyrannises over the rest of the popula-
tion. Should the balance of power change
and all the workers combine to keep the
authority in their own hands, then it is pro-
bable that they will oppress the gilded loiter in
their turn ; in fact, there will be no one else to
oppress, for the worker will certainly not
oppress himself. Mankind is always on the
lookout for a chance to oppress somebody, and'
so long as there is any human nature left in
humanity this aggressive habit will not* die out.
Therefore, man has to decide between two
alternatives—either the worker on whom the
world depends for its prosperity, is to be at
liberty to oppress the idler, who is useless as
well as offensive, or else the idler must con-
tinue to oppress the worker as heretofore. In
other words, it is a question whether, out of
every thousand human beings, there is to be one
monopolist and 90!) slaves, or whether 990 men
are to share the monopoly and leave to the odd
survivor the alternative of either becoming a
worker like the rest, or an outcast. It has to
be decided whether man was made for the
landlord and the capitalist, or not, and if he
was, then it seems almost a pity that anvone
ever took the trouble to make him at all.
The M‘ Kin ley Tariff Act, recently passed by
the United States Congress, finally demolishes
a grand old Freetrade lie which has seen many
years of service in Australia. Ever since the
Freetrade organisation was first formed it has
preached the theory that America had grown
weary of the nefarious system of Protection,
and after many years of bondage was yearning
to cast off' the yoke and open its markets to the
cheap Chinaman, and the Hindoo, and every

Tin; great reaction declines to start. Every
nation which has tried the grand old nostrum
positively declines to try it again. America,
France, Germany, and Spain have all experi-

unanimously, and even England, where, a few
years ago, Protection was as extinct as the
mammoth or the moa, is growing weary of
poverty and hunger and low wages, and wants
to know why all her goods seem to hear the
trade-mark, “made in Germany.” The Free-
trade politician rests his case entirely on the
assumption that one-half the population of New
South Wales and about three-fourths that of
England are in exclusive possession of the light
of truth, while all the rest of the world is in
darkness, and he kindly volunteers to strike a
match and illuminate the earth. But somehow
even when he strikes his match the earth fails
to take any notice of the circumstance.

examination, while a large number never even
reach This test, but are summarily disposed of
by the recruiting officer as hopelessly unfit for
duty. The cheap freetrade loaf, made of im-
ported flour, which has all hut extinguished
the stalwart peasantry of England, is fast
reducing the nation to a mere gathering of
hollow-chested weavers and cotton-spinners,
and already the utter impossibility of finding
fighting material for the defence of the country
has led one Tory journal to suggest that London
should be garrisoned by Sepoys from Bengal
and by Sikh regiments from the land of the
Five River’s, while another wants to know if
Australia cannot be turned into a recruiting
ground for the benefit of a decayed race which
has sold its sons and daughters for the sake
of ready cash. Tn the old days England grew
tired of Protection, because under its auspices
the Tory landlord raised the price of bread and
exploited the nation for his own benefit. Then,
instead of abolishing the landholder—the
principal cause of the prevailing hunger and
scarcity—she invented the bastard system of
Freetrade, and thereby abolished the agricul-
tural population ; in other words, she attempted
to extinguish oppression by letting the oppressor
go and hanging his victim so that he might
escape further injury. It was a strange, in-
verted, upside-down policy, and the wildly-
gifted genius who invented it would probably—
working on the same basis-—have stunned a
rheumatic patient with a club to prevent him
feeling pain, or recommend flogging as an
appropriate cure for hidden grief, inasmuch as
the flogger’s mind would thereby be diverted to
other considerations; but Britain has never
altogether realised the stupendous dimensions
of her own fatuity, and when she fairly com-
prehends the depth and breadth and thickness
of that unexampled blunder which she made
some fifty years ago, it will be too late to
remedy the evil.

81C Macquarie-street North, Sydney, Novembers, 1890,
My Dear Moorahixda,—
The Citizens’ valedictory dinner to GovernorCarington,
at Sydney Centennial Hal), on 28th ult., was a thrilling,
spectacle in a halo of pot plants, and if, perhaps, the
balloon-view from the balconies did occasionally include
tilted soup-plates, dinner-napkins tucked under double
chins, and little green peas ranged along divers glittering
blades—still it was a thrilling spectacle. The board of
honour was set across the top of the hall (with the band
immediately behind, by the way, strumming “ Paul
Jones,” two feet off the tired gubernatorial tympana), and
the Guest, in evening dress with a ribbon order, satat the
right of the Mayor (in official robes) who had Gov. Hope-
toun on his left. Sir Henry Norman at Lord Carington’s
right, the sonsie Kintore, who was as pink as a shrimp, to
the left of the Governor of Victoria, with Cardinal Moran
in his picturesque robes on his left, while the Bishop of
Sydney, who was attired very rustily, was placed to
the right of Chief Justice Parley. The decorations on
the chief table were like an explosion in a dye-factory, and
the stiff fern-leaves tacked about on the hanging cloth
had the effect of cold tea-leaves from above. There
didn’t seem to be enough waiters to go round, and the
frantically floral menus were too sober in colouring. It
was a sort of stork’s feast for the Guest, too, who was
wisely temperate and nibbled rolls principally, and I
distinctly saw the distinguished victim make a
small grimace over his champagne. The orators
were very audible with the exception of Sir
Henry Parkes, whose neatly - proposed toast of
the “ Governor ” sounded like George Leitch heard
per phonograph, and everyone was glad, so far as mere
sound went, when Dibbs .took up the parable in his most
degage manner. Lord Hopetoun made a “ daisy ”
oration, as such orations go, though his calisthenics
suggested that somebody pulled a string to work the
figure, ar.d Lord Oarington’s statistical, sentimental and
non-committal adieu was received with much after-
dinner cheering and a snowstorm of waving serviettes.
Indeed, the enthusiasm all through suggested to your
Sappho that there is nothing like champagne in large
quantities for assuring three sustained howls for anything
under the sun.
If the scene on the floor was on the whole sombre and
suggested a inass-meeting of magpies, the balconies came
nobly to the scenic rescue, for though there were hundreds
of women present, all—save half-a-dozen—were in full war.
paint. Lady Carington, who was welcomed by a perfect
uproar and much waving of handkerchiefs, was accom-
panied by Lady Kintore, who sat at her left, Lady
William Robinson, and young Lord Inverurie, who
anticipated his fate by appearing in an Eton suit. The
vice-regal dress was distinctly special. Lady Carington
wore a trained dress in ivory-white satin brocade with
skirt panel of pearled net; elbow and sleeves of white net
and crystal beads, the turned-down collar lined with
llsse ; diamond ornaments, white gloves, and nosegay
(tied with blue ribbons) of cream roses, forget-me-not
lilies of the valley and fern. Lady Kintore sported a gown
in buttercup brocade draped over cream-silk, the
train having a kind of Centre panel of cream-silk
edged with two rows of gold galon; brocade bodice
with Maude Millet fichu in white chiffon, nosegay of
cream and crimson carnations, diamond pin in the hair;
Lady Robinson appeared in black brocade, the jupe of
jetted net, sleeves of striped jetted net, cluster of white
roses on the corsage, black gloves, row of pearls and a
hand of black velvet round the throat, pearl-and-diamond
crescent in the hair, diamond pendant, Japanese fan.
Then Mrs. Burdekin (the hostess of the galleries) wore
heliotrope armure with the jupe draped in fine lace,
jouane bodiee over a full front of lace, lace sleeves,
diamond necklet, cluster of white flowers on the bodice,
and nosegay in pale tints. Lady Innes wore chocolate-
brown and marigold, the sleeves of yellow silk; Miss
Saumaurez Smith, striped black silk with full sleeves of
black gauze, mantle in w’hite satin brocade with Medici
collar; Miss Broomfield, smoke-grey tulle and brocade,
with trails of scarlet poppies and scarlet fan ; Miss Nellie
Hill, pale-pink and apple-green silk. Most of the on-
lookers wore cream, pink or blue frocks, and so helped
the aesthetic aspect immensely. Coffee, cake and ices
circulated around the galleries, and a buffet was laid in
one of the chambers, where people refreshed themselves
on the way out. The gubernatorial ladies, the Mayoress,
and a great many others, left when the cigars began to
circulate below.
The bouquets carried by the vice-regal trinity were of
the smallest description—at most a dozen flowers bunched
anyhow, so, of course, tiny posies are now all the thing.
Men and women are always florally antagonistic. The
fashionable masculine button-hole is the size of a soup-
plate.
The valedictory public schools concert to Lord and Lady
Carington, held at Centennial Hall on 20th ult., was a
successful, crowded-out affair, where mothers waved long
limp handkerchiefs at the infants on the platform, and
proud fathers encouraged their darlings on the wild high.
C with ear-splitting handclaps. The platform, peopled
mostly with girl choristers all in white dresses with either
crimson or blue scarves, seated in rows one above the
other, the first row holding floral baskets, was most effec-
tive from the front. The s'nging (1500 voices) was pleas-
ing, but the cadets’ vocal march would have looked better
if boys of one height had been chosen instead of being so
selected as to run down in a scoop in the middle (however,,
they were most likely chosen for vocal qualities); and
the “ Federated Australia ” tableau, where young girls
representing the various provinces laid grain, fruit,
flowers, &c., at the feet of a typical Australia (Miss Alpon)i
formed a very effective picture.
The vice-regal party arrived punctually at eight Lady
Carington wore'a dinner dress of pale-blue, with folded
bodice and cluster of plush roses and leaves held by a
diamond star, diamonds in the hair, and came in with
Minister Carruthers, who carried the presentation bouquet
in cream roses tied with blue streamers. Lord Carington,
who seemed to be expanding visibly under the influence
of his near reprieve, brought Mrs. Carruthers in white
silk with black velvet braces and shoulder-knots and
cluster of pink roses. The vice-regal party included Mrs.
Windeycr and Miss Windeyer, who were in blue silk and
white lace fichu ; Mrs. Burdekin, in sunflower silk and net
spangled with gold sequins, corsage bouquet of crimson
roses; Sir Frederick Barley, and the Misses Barley in
black gowns; Mrs. Alfred Allen (hon. secretary to the
concert committee), in black velvet gown with cluster of
saffron roses ; and one or two others.
Last of all the farewell festivities was the complimen-
tary, ball to Lady Carington on 30th tilt, in the Centennial
Hall when the strange, weird element was largely elimin-
ated (as I predicted) though your Sappho did see a lady
sharing her chair with a gentlemen at the supper-tabic
and, one unconventional couple taking a short cut across
the dais while their “Excellencies” were in possession.
Nearly a thousand, attended, and there was a soothing
surplus of men that was very pleasant for everybody' but
the bifurcated wall-flowers themselves. The decorations
wore arranged on the same principle as the club balls,
immense palms everywhere, festoons of greenery and
wreaths of Lady Oarington’s favourite octiuotus*
and two little singing canaries were suspended on either
side of the dais. An excellent supper was served
in the lower chamber, and the table-decorations—large
hearts in cream and crimson roses were gasp-
ingly nice. And so were some of the dresses. Lady
Carington (who left rather early considering the ball was
held in her honour) wore heliotrope silk, chiffon, and
wisteria, diamond ornaments, heliotrope shoes, and im-
mense committee bouquet; Mrs. Burdekin, pcach-pink,
surah, and chiffon, with deep ruche of frayed silk round
the feet, caught with pale-pink flowers, diamond brooches
and necklace. Lady Innes wore a charming turn-out —
the train of striped buttercup silk, the front trimmed and
draped with fine tinted lace, sleeves and bodice trimming
of chiffon caught with yellow bows, magnificent diamonds.
Miss Burdett Smith appeared in white brocade, pearl
trimming, diamond necklace; Mrs. Carruthers, in ivory
silk en traine, black plume fan ; the Misses Holliday,
in yellow and white floral gowns respectively; Miss Bowker,
sap-green moire, shoulder-puffs of green moire with
pink chiffon butterflies, pink plume fan ; Lady Martin’s
diamonds lit up her gown of black-corded silk and jetted
lace. Miss Martin wore pale-blue tulle over satin and
clusters of saffron roses, bouquet of pink roses ; Miss
Frances Saville, jupe of cream brocade, train of pom-
padour brocade in pink and blue edged with pink and
blue ribbon tabs; Miss Barley, an effective frock of
black and white tulle ; Mrs. Yanderveer Greene sported
a Mephistophiles gown that carried all before it. And, let
me add, while among the “un-nervers,” that a scarlet
bag frock trimmed with villainously green fringe ; a pink
satin greenaway gown on a lady considerably over seven,
and the large, imposing creature in slick white satin that
increased her width to amazement-point, most harrowed
the instincts of your slim Sappho.
Mr. Percy Spence has commenced his contribution to
the Australian artists’collection to be sent “Home.” It
is a large canvas, to be called “To Fresh Fields and
Pastures new,” and will represent a weary shepherd lead-
ing bis horse and following a flock of prime merinoes
along-a very special thing in country roads.
The hair - raising - crime of “flailed Back” at Her
Majesty's, needs all the light and colour the management
can conveniently' throw at it, hence it is pleasing to find
that even madness doesn’t prevent a woman from ordering
the latest thing in hats from the milliner, and insisting
on having her shoes en suite. Kate Bishop—who, by the
way, looked like a magnified Nellie Stewart, and whom
we are all glad to welcome back—played Pauline in a suc-
cession of gladsome garments, and Watts-Phillips in the
silly part of “Mary Vaughan,” ran a good second. In
the prologue, Kate Bishop wears a grey corded silk coat
edged with a flounce of grey chiffon, the jupe of silk
looped to show an underskirt of grey velvet; long jabot
of grey velvet, the right side of the skirt having a pane]
pale-pink covered with grey chiffon flounces ; grey gloves
and shoes, and a picture hat in grey gauze and feathers
with a knot of pink in the crown ; Watts-Phillips is
in cream delaine figured Indian red, and Indian red rib.
bons tied in front. In the first act, Watts-Phillips
wears leaf-brown polonaise with sleeves, collar, and under-
skirt of brown silk striped with black velvet; rough straw
hat smothered in roses. In act two, Kate Bishop appears
in a charmingly becoming toilette—a yellow chiffon over-
dress edged with chiffon frills over a brocade jupe, a trail
of hedge-roses and leaves falling from the right shoulder
on to the skirt, elbow sleeves of chiffon open in front I
orownless hat of yellow drawn gauze edged with butter-
cups and leaves and trimmed with a cluster of hedge
roses—Watts-Phillips contrasting pale-blue silk chiffon
and passementerie with this handsome gown. In act
three Pauline returns to reason in a white mull pleated
under-dress edged at the feet with two rows of blue let-
tuce fringe and tied at the waist with a scarf edged with
blue fringe; trained over-dress of pale-blue silk with a
border of pink and crimson roses and leaves applique,
blue shoes. Watts-Phillips here wears a charming dress,
the jupe of pink chiffon edged with gold, the train of
pink armure, high shoulder puffs and scarf-tying in front
and hanging at the edge of the skirt of pink chiffon
finished with gold tassels, the front of the bodice embroi-
dered in gold.
I read that “the very latest fashion is to have the
visiting-card with a raised border,” and possibly some
foolish novelty-hunter may be induced to take it up
under a mistaken idea that the plain, square, paste-card
as thin as a wafer no longer remains the correct label lo
state your identity on. By the bye, I was cpnfronted the
other day with “ mourning ” paper with a sort of rakish
black cap across the right-hand upper corner of paper
and envelope. I was told that it was the “latest fashion ’’
and I tried to look as if I believed it, but it was a great
deal too dashing for the circumstances under which one
uses mourning stationery, and will only be utilised by the
hopelessly vulgar. Yet there are some unthinking people
who take a staring eccentricity on its own value just
because it is retailed by a “good ” shop.
One change “Wales” will notice about “Charlie” is
that he has now to hoist pince-nez when confronted with
print. But it might have been worse, for the gig-lamps
quite suit the Baron. Considering Lord Carington’s
juxtaposition to music at every social outburst for the
last five years, it’s a Wonder he isn’t forging homewards
with an ear-trumpet in his strong right hand.
The wedding of Miss Alice Wright (daughter of Mr. F.
A. Wright, M.L.A., of “ Sunnihilda”) with Mr Copeland
took place at St. Ann’s, Hyde,- on 29th ult., when the
floral decorations of the church were most tasteful. The
bride wore a gown in white corded silk and Valenciennes
lace, diamond star and anchor (the gift of the bride-
groom), and carried a lovely posey of white roses, lily of
the valley, &c. The four bridesmaids (Miss Ida and
Tilly Copeland and the Misses Hilda and Daisy Wright)
were in white mull and wore small while bats trimmed
with velvet and feathers. Breakfast was held in a marquee
on the lawn, Mr. O. R. Bibbs proposing the health of the
bride and bridegroom, and a reception was held in the
drawing-room. The bride’s going-away gown WM

crime of another “Jumbo”: We regard the noise
made in “sending-off” Gov. Carington as simply a
testimonial to the omnipotence of printer’s ink- as the
apotheosis of a big advertiser. Just consider for a
moment: If you go into hysterics and pelt a man with
flowers simply because he, though a lord, has been as
affable to you as a book-canvasser, what are you going to
do when the time comes to reward some unostentatious
the Australian nation? [Many communicationsheldover.]
London Speaker, in a review or Francis
Adams’ “Songs of the Army of the'Night,” says
that Adams can neither speak correctly nor write
grammatically (!), and that he is grossly coarse
and offensively irreverent. What has especially
angered the Speaker is the savagely eloquent
metrical address “To Queen A ictoria on her
Jubilee,” first printed in The Bulletin. Isn't
the Speaker edited by that most toadyish member
of a big literary clique—Andrew Lang?
The heart of M. Gambetta is missing. Its
history is an interesting one. When the post-
mortem examination of the remains of the great
Frenchman was made, under the direction of M.
Paul Bert, the eminent scientist and intimate
friend of Gambetta’s, when that superficial wound
in the arm which we all heard so much about, and
the fatal wound in the abdomen about which noth-
ing was said, had been probed, the heart of the
murdered statesman was taken from the body and
carried away by M. Bert for examination. In his
possession it remained for some years, and was
shown frequently to curious visitors at the labora-
tory. Four or five years ago M. Bert sent the
precious curiosity to Cahors, the birthplace ot
Gambetta, on the occasion of the unveiling ot a
statue of the statesman. Since that date it has
never been seen. M. Paul Bert, it will be reniem
bered, died suddenly in the East. He had always
said that he would have the heart of his fnenc

“A Night Off,” at Sydney Criterion, went
with a loud bang on opening night. The curtain
had to be drawn up three times at the close of the
third act on George Anson’s toga scene, and then,
the enthusiasm continuing, that kilted person was
compelled to take a call before the curtain. Anson
{his humour is not so broad as of yore) and Annie
Taylor are as good as ever in their original parts,
but the play all round is not so strongly cast as
when first produced at the Opera House. Made
up to resemble a washed-out and pared-down
Abraham Lincoln, the Professor Babbit of Robert
Brough is an undignified, idiotic, and weak-kneed
person for whom Rabbit would have been a more
truly descriptive cognomen. Mrs. Robert Brough,
like her predecessor, is scarcely girly-girly enough
as Nisbe; Emma Bronton is not sufficiently
imperious as the termagent Xantippa; Nellie
Mortyne does not suffer by comparison with the
original Angelica; Cecil Ward is scarcely light
enough as the Mercutio-Hke Mulberry; and Owen
Harris, as Damask (made up to resemble Tither-
adge) does not seem at home as a goody-goody
young man. Smaller parts—mere excrescences
that might with advantage be lopped off—are
creditably filled by E. C. Corlesse and W. F.
Olitherow. This play is in for a good run.

It is likely that the feeling of disappoint-
ment produced by Bellew’s Romeo is chiefly due
to the fact that he looks the character so
thoroughly that a high standard of anticipation is
set up only to be demolished when that stagey
person begins attitudinising and mouthing. There-
fore it is that his performance is less satisfactory
than the weaker impersonations of predecessors less
gifted physically and sartorially; therefore it is
that no eye is moist when a draught of “Rough
on Romeo ” takes him off quickly. The quarrel
scene with the nurse is Mrs. Potter’s best effort as
Juliet, and recognising that her lady of one love
has failed to hit Sydney Royal audiences hard,
that astute and business-like charmer will, on
Saturday, begin to impersonate “Camille,” the
lady of many loves, for three nights. “ She Stoops
To Conquer” will be put up next Wednesday and
on next Saturday “ Hero and Leander ” will take
the boards for a fortnight, and the season will
probably conclude with the devotion of two nights
to “La Tosca,” “Frou-Frou,” and “David
Garrick. ”

“Called Back,” at Sydney Her Majesty’s*
has so tickled the public palate, that “The
Merry Wives of Windsor” may not be required to
fill the gap between now and pantomime time.
The charm of the Macari of George Rignold—
an oleaginous, wheedling, sensual, perfidious
animal (reminiscent of an Italian tenor we once
met), is greatly due to the great gap that exists
between it and his usual direct, almost brusque,
manner. Anyhow, the impersonation has pro-
cured for him a renewed lease of popularity.
Manager Macdonald is gradually gaining strength
and though still a little shaky, has now assumed
full command in front.

At Sydney School of Arts, Harry Rickards
faces the music nightly with several new songs,
including “Nevermore,” a ditty likely to be
popular. The company has been strengthened,
numerically at least, by the engagement of Alma
Westleigh, a singer just arrived from London,
whose voice, small but sweet, has been carefully
trained, but whose method is too quiet for music-
hall business ; Emmie Morrison, a dainty little
Tyrolean warbler; E. B. Hogg, an invertebrate
contortionist ; and Frank Hawthorne, the Aus-
tralian mimic, whose imitations of Maccabe,
Greville and Bill Holloway, in particular, are
very good.

Ibbotfc, the only “man of mark” who did
not attend any of the Caringtonian banquets,
continues “to eat into himself for lack of some-
thing else to hew and hack,” at the rate of one
pound-and-a-half daily, and has now lost nearly
two stones in weight inside 14 days. It is a cer-
tainty that more sickness and probably misery is
caused by intemperate eating than intemperate
drinking, and we notice with pain that most of the
uever-touch-its never attempt to curb their
gluttony, and if not martyrs to dyspepsia are
eventually the victims of gout and apoplexy.

“ The English Rose ” started its blooming
career to big business at Melbourne Royal—a
house where a drama by any other name would
smell as sweet these holiday times. Sims and
Buchanan wrote “The English Rose” between
them, and the result is not particularly happy.
The poet seems to have aimed at producing a
serious Irish play, which the rhymester was to
lighten, but neither of them did his portion of the
work so well as he might have accomplished the
whole lot single-handed. Moreover, the central
idea of a priest finding himself the human
envelope of a ghastly secret under the confes-
sional seal has been already presented on the
Australian stage and savagely worried by the
press until there is no life left in it. Likewise the
circumstance of a supposed murderer being
rescued from the law is painfully reminiscent of
aii alleged Irish drama recently produced by
O’Grady. Also the finest pisantry in the world
shoot around exactly as they did a few weeks ago,
which is decidedly monotonous of them, and
finally the hero appears to pop up on the very
same horse that used to carry George Darrell’s
“ double ” over a five-barred gate. In London,
doubtless, the horse has been an interesting fea-
ture, but in Melbourne he comes as a drug on the
market just now. With Carbine fresh in their
minds’ eyes audiences have little or no respect for
the stage quadruped. By the same token, they
cannot pump up excitement over an invisible
steeplechase which seems to be contested in a
shrubbery at the wings. This sporting event may
stir the characters in the drama to their very
souls, but it falls flat on the characters who have
just returned from races they saw and had their
money on. Points in favour of “ The English
Rose ” are, firstly, its pretty and solid scenery, by
Brunton, Goatcher, and Hennings; secondly, its
freedom from brogue. The authors have avoided
comparisons with Boucicault, and nobody says
“ begorra ” to any serious extent, or inquires after
his mavourneen acushla and so forth. Quid
Oireland is, in fact, a good deal like London as
regards its inhabitants.

The now arrivals from “ home ” don’t add
materially to the acting strength of the company.
Laurence Cautley is a small cut of hero with no
apparent fund of dramatic force, and Harold
Russell is a stage villain to match. Miss Mary
Kingsley, however, seems to bring every qualifi-
cation except experience and confidence —a tall,
pretty young creature, strictly fresh and uncon-
ventional in style and manner of speaking. The
honours of the performance fall to Clyndes, who
comes out in the strongest part, while
Arthur Lawrence is sufficiently good as the priest,
and Christine Darrell plays a love-lorn melo-
dramatic female in a strange spirit. J. R.
Greville’s humour has not been affected, one way
or the other, by foreign travel, and a lot of other
people are generally speaking up to the mark, or
somewhere near it.
* * *
“Paul Jones” was received with open
arms at the Opera House, and when the mariners
bold chirped a shaky verse to the effect that they
had come back to stay the gallery betrayed strong
symptoms of joy. Nevertheless the mariners
didn’t seem such salt sea dogs as they were afore-
time, and if they bought a few fresh wheezes with
those bags of bullion, instead of throwing them at
Hudson, nobody would regret the investment.
Otherwise the show has lost very little of its old
attraction, although three changes from the
original cast bring nothing more than novelty to
the scene. Fanny Liddiard’s voice sounds thin
after the Burtonic organ tones, still she scores a
point by looking uncommonly like Kyrlo Bellew
at the end of the second act, Lena Salinger fits
herself fairly well with the sabots of Aggie Kelton,
and the Spanish lady with a red face can easily
divest herself of her superfluous colour.

“TheGondoliers,”at Melbourne Princess’,
is already the talk of the city, and will presumably
turn out to be the richest reef of Gilbert and
Sullivan that the management have struck.
Plenty of opportunities for hurling marmalade at
this gorgeous entertainment will offer themselves
as it rolls along its course, with more than one
member of the number hanging on behind. In
the meantime, a number of first-night patrons
will be relieved at hearing that Flora Graupner
has discarded the scarlet stockings which brought
her limbs too immediately under critical notice,
and has put them into deep mourning instead.
This is a change in the right direction.

“ Harvest,” at the Bijou, makes a deep
impression on that section of the community
which carries a heart into the theatre and yearns
for something more than a comic song, or a gun-
powder explosion. The story is apt, however, to
set some people writhing, and every now and then
a bulbous-nosed savage, who came in expecting to
see something funny, will glance uneasily at the
door as though fearful of a policeman swooping
down upon him with a warrant issued by one of
the sixteen wives cast off by him (the bulbous-
bokoed one) at various periods of his history.
“Harvest” is not the right play for individuals
of this stamp, who invariably slink away after the
prologue and sodden their consciences in rum. On
Saturday the B. and B, company appear in “ Im-
pulse,” with Maud Williamson and Fanny Enson
playing their original London characters, and
Titheradge back in the old place.

Down at the Alexandra things looks cheer-
ful for “The Land of the living,” where th»
“ visional effects’’ are understood to be run on
Pepper’s Ghost principles. There are two notable
touches of nature in this drama. One is a wash-
tub in which Ada Lee purifies the villain’s alter-
native shirt whilst moralising over the troubles of
wedded life. The other touch of nature is pro-
vided by a garden spade, wherewith the aforesaid
villain administers what appears to be a ghastly
crack across somebody’s skull. The spade and the
blow both appear genuine enough. Perhaps the
skull, which belongs to Walter Howe, has been
specially prepared for the occasion.

The Exhibition Hippodrome has rapidly
degenerated in public esteem, but at latest dates a
parachutist was ascending from the Wild West in
a balloon and descending upon chimney stacks and
church-steeples. As there seems a reasonable
chance of this intrepid individual meeting his
death business ought to improve. The worst of it
is that people can stand outside the entertainment
and see the gentleman die gratis. Other shows
are thick in Melbourne this week. At St. George’s
Hall they have the Phonograph, a Circus is some-
where about, the Waxworks and Cyclorama do
well, as a matter of course, and the two variety
shows at Gaiety and Victoria Halls get their shares
of the wandering multitude.

A little slab of Yankee criticism regarding
the well-known Fay Templeton: “ The coming
Fay was ethereal, pensive, sprite-like. The
arrived Fay was adipose, somewhat brazen. The
promised notoriety basked in the freshness and
swelled with the exuberance of youth. Her very
calves were vernal. The furnished notoriety
capered heavily in the light of other days, and her
protuberant physique was autumnal. One may
acknowledge on behalf of the theatre-going public
that the half-disclosed perfections of a sylph are
not without a fervour-stirring charm. But one
does not pare to see a dowager in tights. And
dowagerhood betrays itself not only in black silk
and side curls, but in fleshly lines. A sylph with
a stomach may be possible, but it is tedious. A
sylph may pose, but Heaven spare us when she
adiposes !,’ It is the pathetic old story over again.
There is no place in all this world for the fat,
elderly heroine, and earth has no fury like a cor-
pulent female scorned.

Manager Williamson has embellished the
dress-circle entrance to Melbourne Princess’ with
choice frames of autographed photos of Irving,

Oriental alderman all over. Only a few years
ago he was playing dashing young heroes in
dramas, and now he wears a beard ! Well, they
certainly were hair-raising productions.

A crowd of amateurs attracted large and

The Leicester Magistrates recently refused a license for
the appearance of little May Hannan in “ Hans the Boat-
man,” on the ground that her education was being
neglected. An idiotic decision, which reminds us that
Arnold was lucky to make his £5OOO in Australia—mostly
in Melbourne—before the Victorian law against infant
prodigies was enforced. A policeman would have to walk
on the stage and arrest May Hannan if she were appear-
ing at the Bijou nowadays.
Playing “ Chawles” at Dunedin Princess’—with Jimmy
Moore in management for W. and G. —Toole successfully
worked off his old clothes-gag, wherein, while wearing
the livery of a very much bigger man, a leg of the knee-
breeches drops to his ankle, and, he pretending it is an
accident, the people roar at his apparent misfortune and
simulated embarrassment. It is the veriest horse-play
and would deceive only a novice, nevertheless the Otago
Daily Times critic—not knowing what buffoonery this
high-class comedian ( vide S.M. Herald) is capable of—
devotes a-flfth of a column to praising “the singular
adroitness of the apposite remarks with which Mr. Toole
passed the mishap off after ineffectually endeavouring by
closing Ms legs to check the downward movement.” They
are awfully green at Dunedin, and that’s just how Toole
likes ’em. Worse than all, some of the stupid people on this
side, who should know better, clip the item.

An Australian medico having surreptitiously won the
heart of a “ private ” barmaid visiting his city in the care
of a theatrical manager, was surprised to receive a visit
from the showman, who thanked him for taking a some-

ticket for two at his disposal. The'lady, with her sex’s
hankering after the theatrical, not to be got rid of so
easily, threatens the showman with a breach of promise
action, and he, fearing exposure, knows not what to do.

It is said that Cardinal Newman once sent a note to
Braham—the great Jewish tenor, advertised to take part
in the annual "musical services at St. Mary’s for the benefit
of the Radcliffe Infirmary—interdicting his singing.
Braham took no notice ; at the appointed time in the pro-
gramme he stood up in the organ gallery, and filled the
church with his magnificent voice. Newman waited for
him at the foot of the organ staircase to demand an
apology for the invasion of his rights. The answer he
received was, “You did your duty, and I did mine,”
saying which, Braham brushed past him and hurried
away.

Here is an extract from a rondo in Luscombe Searelle’s
“ Black Rover ” (played in Australia as ‘ ‘ Isidora ”): ■
My darling Isidora !
Why do I love my darling so,
And long her face to see ?
Perhaps it is because I know
My darling she loves me.
And oh 1 ’tis bliss to feel that she is near,
And comes to me
Here by the sea !
Where I can whisper to my dear.
With nought to fear
And none to hear.”
Great poet, Searelle.

Shakespeare as is the poor old lady who pitifully

but they give a pleasant, homely entertainment, the sort
of show that attracts and gratifies the non-theatre goer.
The auld mon is a pawkie chield, who sings a comic song
and tells a funny story with considerable humour. Mrs.
Bairnsfather has evidently had much experience on the
concert platform, and Maggie B. has a particularly sweet
and sympathetic voice. Jock and Meg dance gracefully,
and Mr. Nunn fiddles acceptably. Fred. B. Norton
illuminates the front of the house.
It is now a subject of debate in managerial circles as to
whether the Beautiful and Artificial Actress or the Fine,
Old Crusted Comedian is the keener.
Gounod was to get a million of francs for conducting
sixty performances of his works in America. His travel-
ling expenses Were to be paid, and his hotel bills, with
those of his secretary' and servant, and the steamer
fares to cover his journey home as well as out. He was
also to have a share in (he “gate money” when it
exceeded a certain sum. He signed a contract and then
discovered that his health was bad, and that Mrs. Weldon
would probably make a fresh legal attack on him when
she got him on American soil. So he broke it, and now
he is involved in legal troubles independently of the inter-
ference of the litigious soprano.
An ambitious “ super,” whose soul hungered for the
applause he never got, had, on one occasion, a speaking
part of one line : “ The countess awaits you in the con-
servatory, my lord.” Every night he got this off differ-
ently, sometimes he was defiant, anon humble and always
impressive, yet never got a hand. He became desperate
and one evening after getting rid of his message : “ The
countess awaits for you in the conservatory, my lord,” he
inarched right down to the footlights a/id said: “ Let me
also add that the villain who would lay' his hands on a
woman, save by way of kindness, is unworthy the name
of Briton and a man.” He got a big round, likewise the
sack.

“The Diver’s Luck” is an enormously successful drama
this year in New York, the sensation-scene being at the
bottom of the sea. In the first act a millionaire and his
wife are drowned crossing the Atlantic, taking a valuable
box of diamonds with them to the bottom. Later on - the
villain cuts an Atlantic cable, and the hero dives to the
bottom to repair it, while the villain goes to pick up the
diamonds. Sensation with the bodies of the millionaire
and millionairess floating about—fight with an octo-
pus, disc.
“Agitate 1 Agitate !” used to be the cry of an old Mel-

for the star, who would hang around, loth to depart for
his dressing-room and miss that interesting piece of
guiver—a call before the curtain.

People I Have Met in Sydney.
A “ GUBBANA."
No. I.
DR. Lang, in his “ History of New South Wales,’’
tells an amusing story of old Bungary, the chief
of the Sydney tribe of blacks. The chief had a
great knack of showing how the different
Governors made a bow, but when requested to
make a bow like the then Governor he prudently
refused, saying : “ ’Top, ’top ; baal me do it that
yet; ’top nudda Gubbana come.” Bungary evi-
dently held it sound policy never to exhibit the
reigning “Gubbana.” But in those days “ Gub-
banas ” did reign, for weal or woe, in good earnest,
and stormed, too, very often. Then they dealt
out land, and in rum, so it was as well to keep
friendly with tnem, and Bungary was wise in his
generation.
But we have changed all that now. Instead of
granting us land and selling us rum, they give us
“taffy,” and sell us —well, I hardly know what
they do sell up unless it’s an aide-de-camp or two
now and then for our daughters. The rum was
comforting; as for the A.D.C. —well, let Mrs.
and time tell. I have only met two “ Gub-
banas ” in Sydney. The first, a worn-out diplo-
matist, with the musty flavour of the Foreign
Office clinging to him still —a man bound hand
and foot with red-tape—a round peg in a square
hole; but, de mortals nil nisi bonum, he and his
kind are, I suspect, dead to Australia for ever.
The second, a tired man about town—a man who
reminds me of times gone by, of times which
make one feel inclined tu sing, as did pretty
Nelly Bromley in “ The Creole ” at Toole’s Theatre
(only it wasn’t Toole’s theatre then)
Years do not make me see the clearer,
One feels of age at thirty-nine.
She sang niafy-nine, but it comes to much the
same thing, for now-a-days most of us begin to
feel a bit played-out at thirty-nine. Hereminded
me of times—not so very many years ago, after
all —when Kate and Susie Vaughan were in the
ballet at the Metropolitan Music Hall, long before
Fred. Wellesley made a fool of himself with Kate,
and Maude Branscombe and her sister were ditto
at the Alhambra. Before Florence St. John
deserted the Strand, and Mr. Smith (alias Lith-
Sow James) took to the gentle Marius. When
Jmily Duncan and her sister were still to the
fore, and gave those little parties not a hundred
miles from Winchester-street, Pimlico. Before
St. John’s Wood became so mighty respectable.
When Scott’s was crowded, and the'Globe a howl-
ing wilderness at night. When old Jenkins, the
tobacconist at the corner of the Haymarket
used to make a mistake and fill your glass
with champagne instead of soda, if he knew
you were not particular about your change, when
you stepped in to buy a packet of cigarettes for
pretty Minnie Douglas on your way to 87. Before
Connie Gilchrist came out, or Fail Cairns—
Heaven rest his soul ! —wore tail-coats. When
sprightly Nelly Farren was only about a hundred
years old, but still as young—and good, too —as
evet; and Lord Hopetoun was a red-headed boy
tied to, his mother’s apron-strings up in Linlith-
gowshire. Before ladies vyere allowed downstairs
a,t Eyaus’, and before the poor naughty “ Duke’s”
was shut and the Westminster Aquarium open.
Aes, he reminds me of these things, “ only that
and nothing more.” I don’t remember him in the.
lyorlds of. art, science, literature, diplomacy or
politics. But yet he suddenly burst upon an
astonished world, as full-blown “Gubbana” of
England’s, grandest colony, and all I can say is
“• que djiable aUait-il faire dans rette i/alere ? ”
• * *
The Colonial Office people seem to have in,
their minds just now, with reference to,
■ colonials,” Shylock’s words, “If you tickle
u,s, do we not laugh ? ” So. they tickle us
with a lord, and—we laugh, at least most of us
do. If the “ Gubbana ” can manage to tickle an
earldom for lii,mself out of us, why so much the
better—for him. They tickle us with a “Gub-
bana ” who has shaken hands with so many
people, that op his return to the “ jpother ”
country he may discover that unless h,e alters,
his style —which he will the ultra-refined
will npt shake hands with him. They tickled us
with a “G.ubbana” who had enough money left
of his own to be able to afford to, spend almost
the whole of the inpome he got frojn the colony
in the colony. They tickle us with a “ Gubbana ”■
who brings with him as aides-de-camp, a mini be i;
of young fellows who know yery little of the
World in general, and absolutely nothing of Aus-
tralia in particular. What dreadful mistakes
thpy might make to be sure, in granting the
oppn, sesame to, the kingdom of Government
House ! They might, fog instance, accept
a publican a,ud reject a sinner (in the
sense of having no money). Qpen their arms to,
the flashy daughters of a lady of somewhat lax
ideas on the subject of husbands, and plose the,
doors to quieter girls with purer mothers. Admit
a retired butcher, and exclude a retired officer.
“Pal” with gentlemen whose fathers helped to
make the roads, and overlook gentlemen whose
fathers helped to make history. Shut out the
mistress, and welcome the servant-girl (though
here they might often be acting wisely). Forget
the Oxford man who writes fop a newspaper, and
remember the Potts Point snob who owns it. In
Short, might make such, fppls of themselves
and their master, that all that is decent and wise,
and well-bred in,Sydney, might laugh in itssleeve
and keep aloof. I say they might do any or all of
things, but, perhaps, where ignorance is
bliss ’tis folly to be wise. They tickle us with a
“ Gubbana ’’’who, though lie may be q uite cm fait as
to what goes, on in Pall Mall, is in a state of blissful
ignorance as regards the Pacific. They tickle us
with a negative lord ; let them give us. a, positive
man,. They would fain feed u,s on sugar ; we are
pjd enpugh, to eat strong meat-.
A little tickliner is all very’well, but too much
makes people mad. We aye not all such fools Or
children to bedazzled by a coronet, np.matter how
amiable may be the man who wears it. We don’t
much care what our “Gubbana” wears, on his
head, so long ag he has brains in it. Bah !
lam positively getting serious, and certainly no
one who, knows him would dream of ta- ing those
highly ornamental “Gubbanas” seriously. So,
until the people at home get it fairly into their
heads that we really want someone useful, this
variety will do as well, or perhaps better than,
another. Jolly Nash used in those bygone days
of which I have spoken to sing a song of which'.l
can jvist remember the chorus. I hope New South
Wales, driven mad by too much tickling, will
never- be forced to sing it to Old England. It ran
this way;—
Don’t you be ridiculous ;
Don’t you come and tickle ns ;
Go and tickle someone else ;
You mustn't t ickle me.

The blushing moral policeman in charge
of the Carlton (Vic.) lockup found himself in a
complicated position the other day. He had a
prisoner on hand named Jemima Ann, or some
such name, who was in trouble for profane
language complicated by drunkenness and road-
metal, and he went into her cell to bring her
before the court in the customary way. But when
he opened the door the unprotected female inside
began to shriek, and next moment the officer shot
out again in a confused state of mind, and reported
to the bench that he couldn’t, produce the defen-
dant because she had nothing on. She hadn’t
buried her clothes for there was no place where
she could put them, and she hadn’t burned them,
and if she had shoved them through the window
tliey would be found lying in the yard—anyhow,
the clothes were gone, and nothing but an undis-
guised woman remained. Possibly she had eaten
her entire wardrobe, but the constable refused to
advance an opinion on this point. As it was
obviously impossible to consider the case in the
ordinary way, the prisoner was forcibly put to
bed, and then the magistrate entered the cell and
asked her if she pleaded guilty or not guilty, but
the distracted female returned an evasive answer
and asked him if his grandmother was a monkey,
and then as she started to burst out of bed again

the bench broke up and fled in dismay. Case

The series of attempts to. set fire to the
Palace Hotel, Melbourne, recall in their malignant
persistency one of the exploits of a noted N.Z. fire-
raiser of 2Q years ago, named Cyrus Haley. He
had been a well-to-do storekeeper, but being bitten
by money-hunger, went headlong into min-
ing speculation. These were the days when the
Thames goldfield was turning out 200,000 ounces
a, month, and when Tom Russell, now C.M.G.
and in London, was the Napoleon of the share-
market. Haley lost all he had in the vortex,
blamed Russell’s manipulations of the market as
the cause, and swore to be revenged,. Russell
had several thousand pounds invested in the N.Z.
Insurance Company and Haley decided to strike
Russell through that corporation. In a very few
months’ time nearly the whole of Queen-street,
Auckland, had been burnt, also the Choral Hall
and a vessel lying at the wharf, and the New
Zealand Insurance was a heavy loser. The place
was in a state of terror till at last’Haley was cap-
tured red-handed and sent up for a long temp
He broke out of Mount Eden Gaol, and before
being recaptured emptied a six-chambered
revolver at Russell through a window of the
latter’s palace at the Pah. Haley was then trans-
ferred tu Dunedin Gaol, from which he made two
escapes, but in the second passed in his checks
with a warder’s bullet through his spine. ‘
That awful accident to some person in
high life, which is always on the verge of taking
place, yet is averted at the last moment, and con-
sequently never comes off, has nearly happened
again without success. There is a dire and soul-
destroying monotony in the inherent cussedness
of that catastrophe which always misses fire, and
the latest incident is as monotonous as the rest.
Governor Hopetoun was attending a cattle-show,
and a cart-horse bolted right at him witli the
intention of pounding him into a squashy mass of
boots and pulp witli its enormous hoofs, and
jumping up and down on his corpse. Any ordinary
man would simply have stepped aside, and let the
animal pass, but the Governor was looking the
other way, and had no idea that death, clad in
hair and hide, was rushing down upon him. Then,
just as the awful tragedy was about to burst on a
horrified people in all its bloodstained naked-
ness, somebody gave his Excellency a shove and
sent him out of the way, and nothing took place.
Also the horse stopped before it reached the place
where Hopetoun had been standing, so that even
if he hadn’t been shoved out of the way there
would have been no incident after all. Later
reports revealed the fact that it was only going at
a slow trot, anyhow, and when the matter was
more fully investigated it was ascertained that it
wasn't there at all. Further, it transpires that the
Governor was at home in bed at the time, and the
only foundation for the rumour lay in the fact
that a Chinaman was nearly drowned in the bar-
hour two weeks previously. His Ex.’s escape,
however, has been the subject of much congratu-
lation, for even though there was no horse
accident it is felt that he might easily have fallen
out of bed and broken his neck, and his life was
only saved by the providential circumstance that
he stayed where he was,
Deal- Bulletin,—Noticing several head-
ings in several papers, and each phrased thus,
‘ Religious Persecution,” reminded me of a re-
bnke once administered by a judge to a barrister
practising before him. If you take the phrase
“Religious Persecution,” and turn it inside out,
yon must come to the conclusion that it means
the persecution of others by religious zealots.
Yet, it has come into common newspaper vogue
as bearing the interpretation, “The Persecution
of Religion,” which is a very irreligious sort of-
persecution. I noted this heading even in that
heavy critic of “ pure English,” the Argus, whose
philological lance (thick as a bludgeon) is so fre-
quently used to tickle vulgar errors. Well, about
my judge. He was presiding over a Court of In-
solvency, and a barrister was continually annoy-
ing him with the over-use of the phrase-“ This
honourable Insolvent Court.” His Honor bore it
with’equanimity for a time, but at last interrupted
the counsel with—“ You have a score of o
alluded to this Insolvency Court * e «
honourable Insolvent Court.’ That i
libel. This Court is not insolvent and if , a ? r ° ss
be honourable if it were.” The krrl t OU dll ’>
hint and floundered ahead. jVlost to °k the
English is pernicious. That wouldn’f WSpaper
much, but what does annoy is that most i matter

‘Take him from our

The people of Wagga, the
people of Broken Hill,
the people everywhere
revolt from the idea of
seeing murder in any
form at their doors, and
cry, “Away with it,
away with it, anywhere ‘
—to the farthest bounds
of the province—to the
farthest limits of our
country !” But it is a
fetich, to which they have
been born and bred—an
old, traditional fetich im-
posed upon them by the
ignorance and brutality
of a long line of rulers
and priests. It will die
with the death of ignor-
ant and brutal statecraft
and priestcraft, even as it
has died in the regener-
ated Italy of Beccaria.
Dear Bulletin, —The leading Australian'
papers have lately had cablegrams that a Bond'
street (London) jeweller had purchased some
500,000 acres of land from the West Australian
Government. You also refer to the matter in
your article on “ Foreign Capital ” (August 23rd).
The cablegram has caused great amusement in the
north-west, as the facts of the case are as follow:
Mr. Streeter, who owns a small pearling-plant
working on the N.W. coast, composed of the
smallest and worst luggers now in these seas, has,
through his manager, purchased the lease of
half-a-million acres of land from the West Aus-
tralian Government, the yearly rental of the whole
of which is £l2 10s., or in reality about as much,
perhaps, as it cost to send the cablegrams an-
nouncing the event. It is a desert waste of sand
and poor scrub, that would require 1000 acres or
more to carry one sheep. It has evidently been
purchased with a view to floating into a public
company. At present it is only used as a
rendezvous for the boats now employed pear-
fishing. If the land is leased the blacks can be
used by the lessee as hired servants , and are
used—that is, any squatter so named can sign--
“save the mark !”—the natives as £ ener ,
servants and make them work in any way '
pleases. There are at present about 100 beau
cattle on this important block, and one
is engaged.— Truth, Roebuck Bay, Weste
Australia.

Assizes, not over the criminal, but over the victim
—a woman, 84 years of age, who was done to
death by her daughter. After the tears, his
Honor awarded 18 months’ hard.
Bismarck having stated once that: “A
journalist is a man who has failed in his profession
in life,” it is suggested that the ex-Ohancellor’s
epitaph shall be:
He lived a Statesman.
He died a Journalist.
The now celebrated Col. Price organised
his Victorian cavalry in 1885. and they number
1000, which is to be increased to 1200, in two
regiments of 600 each, there being now only one
regiment. Price first made lus mark by organising
mounted police after the Kelly scare.
The report that O’Donovart Rossa had
started to make all honest living in the Whisky
trade is contradicted. He is engaged in trading
off a particularly loathsome brand of cigar, which
smells like Sodom and Gomorrah, and wrecks the
Constitution of the hated Sassenach.
The Prince of Wales was going witli his
gold-bug, banker Hirsch, for a jaunt to the latter's
castle, in Bohemia, but was positively threatened
off it by the Emperors of Germany and Austria,
there being no Jews received at the Vienna Court,
save a pair of Rothsoliildren, in a little-finger
shaking Way.
It is well known that Rossetti buried his
M.B, poems in the coffin at the feet of his wife ;
now it is said that, years after wlieh Rossetti
agreed that the coffin should be Opened for their
recovery, the friends whom he had deputed were
amazed to find “that the wonderful hlonde hair
had grown to her feet, ttnd formed a perfect net-
work of gold over the papers.”
The Age is of opinion that the qualities
which go to make a Wellington would probably
unfit a man to become a Chief Justice Higin-
botham. That’s true. The born soldier isn't a
born socialist by long chalks. In fact, on all
subjects except scientific slaughter the born
soldier is a good deal of a born fool. Caesar and
Napoleon to the contrary notwithstanding.
Old Moltke has been recently congratu-
lated on turning the corner of DO. Turenne,
killed at 04, was thought a worn-out veteran at
the age when Moltke began to creep into notice,
two years before Sadowa, and six before Sedan#
Metz and Paris. Radetsky, at 83, fought his
amazingly active Novara campaign of 1849.
Havelock got no show till 62, and Clyde was 65 in
the Indian Mutiny, his first action being
Vimiera, at 16 years old.
Mr. John Williams, the N.S.W. Crown
solicitor, who began practice as an attorney in
1842, has gone for a few months’ leave, and will
be temporarily succeeded by the astute Mr, Robert
Smith. When it was suggested that a N.S.W.
Supreme Court Judge should be sought for
amongst the attorneys, the Bar article being
scarce, Mr. John Williams’ name was bracketed
with those of the late Messrs. Stephen Campbell
Brown and E. A. Scarvell.
James Munro, the new Victorian Premier,
was born in 1832, and is thus 58. He started
Victoria Permanent Building Society in 1865, on
the model of the Edinburgh Scottish Property
Investment Co., and poor little Jemmy Mirams
was tempted to pot against kettle. At a Carlton
election Munro’s opponent bought up all the meet-
ing-places, and, therefore, teetotal Munro ran up
a new hall for himself, at a cost of £2OOO, because
he wouldn’t hold a meeting in a hotel.
Judge Boucaut (S.A.), the broad and
comprehensive policy man, comes into a nice not
of money by the decease of old McCulloch, whose
daughter he married, Boucaut is one of the most
fearless and unconventional of men, and has been
known to take off his boots and stroll down the
jetty at Glenelg to his yacht on a Sunday, right
through the church people. After delivering a
judgment in the Supreme Court on an intricate
case, he will go dowh to the bay, take off his
boots, and help » fisherman off the beach with his

POLITICAL POINTS
Nearly all Elections are “ bily” elections.
There is but one avowed Republican in
the Victorian Parliament.
Some portions of the Melbourne press ate
endeavouring to air the “ bloody shirt ” in the
present crisis.
“ A Medley of Intrigue” is what Premier
Gillies called the Victorian Opposition. But it
got there all the same.
The Sydney Single-Taxers are now on the
eve of open war with the Revenue-Tariff crowd by
whom they have been milked so long,

With the fall of the Gillies Ministry dis-
appears the last of the Governments which form-
ally approved of the Parkes scheme of “ Federation
under the Crown.”
“Parliament is largely what the reporters
make it,” says Chief Secretary Deakin. Then,
again, the reporters are exactly what their pro-
prietors (this term to be taken literally) make
them.
When the public gallery of the New South
Wales Assembly Chamber, which holds 120 people,
was opened to the public on the evening of the
no-confidence debate, 56 persons were found com-
fortably seated therein.
Chief Secretary Deakin is regularly played
out just now and has made a dying-swan oration,
snivelling over Gillies. Alfred had better take a
turn at table-turning, now they are turned. What
can he do ? Stick to Dunky ?
The Ballarat Trades and Labour Council,
anxious to be represented on the magisterial
bench, have submitted to the Minister for Justice
for appointment four names: one a mining engine-
driver ; another, a bricklayer; a third, a tailor :
and the fourth, a blacksmith.
Coalition rules both sides of the Victorian
Parliament now, that is to say, the Tories boss
both the Ministry and Opposition. It is laugh-
able to hear talk about the Labor Party having
extinguished Gillies. Victoria Permanent and
Federal Bank Munro the Labor Party !
During the course of the N.S.W, vote of
censure debate, Treasurer M'Millan observed,
“ more in sorrow than in anger,” that “ there is a
difference between true and spurious friendship.”
It doesn't take long for a colleague of Parkes to
become fully aware of that interesting fact.
The alleged Parkes Government pro-
gramme is to carry throngli the pending Public
Works proposals, the Rabbit Bill alld the
Estimates, go into recess until March, and then
submit a financial policy aking off £(500,000
Customs-duties, to be balanced by direct taxation.
On a deputation to the N.S.W. Govern-
ment, asking that certain iron pipes should be
made in the colony provided the figure Was not
much higher than that of the imported article,
were Messrs. J. E. Tonkin and Francis Abigail—
Freetrader members of the local Legislative
Assembly!
Sarcastically said Mr, “Jack” Hamilton
in the Queensland Assembly : —“ lam informed
that the Sheriff wrote across the memorandum
that he (the labour delegate who is charged with
having applied for the local hattgmanship) was
not sufficiently respectable for the position. I
■ think lie is sufficiently respectable.”
John Burns asserts that he has nevef
advised strikes, that they furnish a crude, suicidal
and brutal method of settling a dispute. Strikes
dislocate and demoralise trade, and he would do
away with them altogether. Hence he wishes to
transfer the conflict to the House of Commons and
to the ballot-boxes in the constituencies.
Gillies was Victorian Premier five years,
but M'Culloch had the longest continuous turn, 60
days more than Gillies, during the reign of that
great combination which, at one time or other,
included Higinbotham, Michie, Fellows (a month
or two), Heales (till he died), Francis, Verdon, and
Grant - who replaced Heales as Land Minister.
In the Victorian want of confidence
division the Government was beaten on a fairly-
called division by 55 votes to 35. In the N.S.W.
want of confidence motion the . Opposition was
defeated on a surprise division by 46 to 23. In
all such cases, divisions should be taken at an
agreed time in the interests of honesty and
finality.
Switzerland simmers in the same throes as
have been passed through by the American United
States, struggle between the Central Government
and local State Independence, but with this differ-
ence ; that in America the Democrats had a
reasonable fear of Csesarism, whereas the Swiss
Liberals rule centrally, and are resolved to rule
locally, all round.
The prospective attempt on the part of the
associated employers to bring to their knees, by
means of imported labour and starvation, the
370,000 members of the British marine unions, is
simply a mad scheme to incite an enormous body
of sturdy and resolute men, shut out by monopoly
from the sources of- production, to the use of
dynamite and the fire-stick.
After all, where’s the benefit in swapping
Premier Dunky Gillies for Premier Jimmy Munro?
Gillies is a Liberal hitched and harnessed on to
the Tories, like Pitt, while Munro is a solid,
bound - hand - and - foot -to - capital Conservative,
hitched on to the Liberal chariot. Never was
Liberal—look at his face, a building society
Mookbeeth, with hacked claymore.
The effete Constitution of Western Aus-
tralia is about to go down to its grave unwept,
nnhonour’d and unsung,” except by a small Tory
band. Its last dying kick, in the shape of
electoral conditions which have secured the disen-
franchisement of one-fourth o| the country, has
incited the incensed people to anake “Manhood
Suffrage ” the slogan of the first general election
under Responsible Government.
Coppde, the academician and poet, is a
sentimental socialist. At the brilliant entertain-
ments to which he is invited he is apt,
abstractedly, to inquire from the guests : : “If
they know their luxury is so many miseries ? Do
they ever think of it ? Do they think of it as often
as they should ? Do they think of it all?” It was
Coppee’s question which vwas asked in the
“objectionable ” leaflet circulated by the N.S.W.
Labour Defence Committee among the guests at
the Carington banquet the other night.
There is a remarkable paper in London
Spectator, to hand by last mail, on “Colonial
Loyalty and the Vatican.” The significant thing
in the article is a thorough recognition that the
Australian Republic, or, as the Spectator
calls it Democratic Federation, is inevitable.
Otherwise the trend is that Catholicism, as a
democratic and republican power, will gain
ground in Australia, as in the United States.
The writer points out that loyal priests are at a
discount. The article is decidedly one to be read.
Says Michael Davitt of the policy of his
new paper, The Labour World ;
The overthrow of landlordism will be one of its most
cherished ambitions. “The Land for the People,” and
not for any class, will be our watchword, and to this
battle-cry we will try and rally the democratic forces of
the three countries. The public ownership of land
mines, minerals, royalties, woods, forests, fisheries, sea-
shore rights and railways will be strenuously advocated.
The revenues derived from these sources must be devoted
to the good of the industrial community if we are to
battle successfully against the poverty and wretchedness
which class legislation and individualistic greed have
bred in the organisation of society.
Lady Dilke says the arguments of the
Capitalists and most of the clergy remind her of
“ a fond mamma who had two children—Tommy
and Maria. When mamma had a beautiful cake
or fruit, she used to call Tommy and say : ‘ Now’
Tommy, divide that with Maria in a Christian
spirit.’ That meant that he was to give Maria
the bigger half of the cake or the apple. Tommy
was a good boy, a very good boy, and he went on
bearing it for a long time, but at last he said :
‘ Mamma, mayn’t Maria begin to divide the cakes
now in a Christian spirit ?’ ” Capital has played
the Maria with Tommy the worker long enough,
and it is now Maria’s turn to give Tommy the
biggest hunk.
A person named Chapman has started to
deliver a course of lectures throughout Australia
on some hazy object or fact or animal which
threatens to undermine what he calls the “Pro-
testant succession” to the British throne. The
old Orange fanatic can, like Parson Madgwick
Griffith and Co., never understand that the
world has moved on a little since the siege of
Derry. There will be no British throne at all
soon, and no “ succession, ” and as the only duty
of the sovereign is to draw an enormous screw and
hunt up pensions for her sisters, and her cousins,
and her uncles, it doesn’t matter whether she is a
Protestant or a Mohammedan, or a cow-and-cat
worshipper, or an individual who attends Joe
Somes’ tabernacle. The matter isn’t of the
slightest importance, anyway.

Society
All the Governors of N.S. Wales Were
not sent on their way rejoicing as was Baron
Carington. Governor Ralph Darling, for instance.
In 1827, the Sydney Turf Club gave a dinner at
which certain disparaging remarks ahd unfavour-
able comparisons were made between Darling and
his predecessor, the band playing not “Over the
water to Charley” but “Over the hills and far
away,” when the Governor’s health Was proposed.
On leaving the colony no complimentary banquet
was tendered, but H.E. ’s opponents, lev! by W. C.
Wentworth, gave a free banquet at Yaucluse
where a bullock was roasted whole, and drink
distributed ad lib. As the ship Hooghly, with
Darling aboard, passed Yaucluse the assemblage
hooted and hissed most energetically.
* * #
Australian Governors’ wives should, re-
member the Bowen incident. The estimable lady
of that bucolic Governor went ’Ome for a trip and
on her return—well, “absence makes the heart
grow fonder” sometimes. And sometimes it
doesn’t.
* * *
“An accident of birth has made your
Governor Lord Carington,” said Gov. Hopetoun
at the big Carington banquet, at Sydney. But
should not the statement be reversed, thus : —“ An
accident of birth has made Lord Carington your
Governor?” How, for example, would this sound,
“An accident of birth has made Victoria’s
Governor Lord Hopetoun ?” Would young Hope-
toun really have the impudence' to stand up and in
snoh words convey the idea that he would have been
Governor of Victoria perforce of his own innate
ability, apart altogether from his inherited titles
and riches ? It is amusing to see how Governor
No 1 (you see we don’t put a bill-point after the ‘o’)
sticks to Governor No. 2.
* * *
Captain Helbert, in his speech at the Car-
ington farewell banquet, said he felt the greatest
diffidence in responding on behalf of the fair sex,
in that he was the only remaining member of
H.E.’s staff who had not had the good fortune to
be able to avail himself of the fair chances which
they saw in such profusion around them every day
and that night above them. (Laughter and “Oh !
oh !”) The gallant captain is widely credited with
being engaged to N.S. W. richest heiress, but he
evidently appreciates the proverb about there
being many a slip ’twixt the cup and the lip.
# # #
The S.M. Herald publishes a long article
which, after you pan out of it all about the
turquoise-blue sea, and the wooded walks and
grassy lawns of Government House, Sydney, and
the softly-breathed syllables and whispered vows
of youths and maidens, means that Lady
Carington has been a magnificent success as
a match-maker, and that a lot of the local
aristocracy will hereafter “link their happiness
with the thoughts of a noble name and join their
first appreciation of each other’s charms with the
opportunities lent them by a kindly and a willing
hostess.” Smooth, easy prophecy ! The N.S. W.
Greased Lightning Divorce Bill is now pretty well
through.
* - * *
Old Sir Alfred Stephen, when sworn in as
Acting Governor, of N.S.W., had thirteen guns
fired in his honor. As this expensive old gentle-
man enjoys a huge pension, it is surely rather too
much that the public should spend a lot of money
in senseless thunder-blasting to emphasize the fact
that he is reaching out his bediamonded fore-finger
for more perks.
* # #
The Perth (W.A.) Liedertafel have duly
serenaded Governor “Bill” Robinson, and that
troubadour enchanting is alleged to be preparing
a new part-song for his admirers—a song about
moons, and maidens, and lingering embraces, and
suchlike giddiness.
* * *
Baron Carington evidently rather fancies
the peroration of his citizens’ banquet speech, as
he has just shouted it verbatim into the phono-
graph. It runs: “Generous is the nation which
can thus speed (evidently a misprint for ‘feed ’)
its parting guests, and fortunate those guests who
found their welcome at once in adoption, and
whose farewell ‘ leaves half their hearts behind.’ ”
Was it “ hearts ” your Lordship said? Who-oop!
* # #
“ Cardinal Moran and Primate Smith
have,” we read, “exchanged cards.” From this it
would appear that the heads of alleged Christian
Churches are expected to be on purely wild-beast
terms and to view one another just as the savag e
Zoo. tiger views the snarling black panther in th e ■
cage beyant. If Primate Smith and Cardina
Moran really Want to be friendly, let them
exchange collections !

Carington, one of the plainer banqueters, Who was
about to stevedore peas into his mouth With his
knife, preceded active operations by putting both
hands to his jaWs, and after some little difficulty.

and alligator’s teeth. This hideous mass wa* calmly
placed beside him on the table to reflect its beauty
on the glitter around.

At the Sydney send-off banqdet to Gbv.
Carington Mr. Dibbs turned the gush-tap full on
and told his brother revellers that “ten thousand
bright eyes were looking down on them.” As
there Were only 1500 ladies upstairs watching the
animals feeding they must have averaged over six
eyes each —which somehow recalls the story of
Mr. Fox, who, upon one occasion, saw two
Speakers!) in the Housh o’ Commons!).
* * *
A prisoner With a moving tale to relate
appeared last week in a Victorian police-court.
He said that he and the policeman who ran him
in were in love with the same girl, but the maiden
turned up her nose at the officer and refused to
smile upon his suit. Then, by way of vengeance,
the debased “cop” hit his rival over the head with
his official club and arrested him on a charge of
assault, his object being to hug the lady at the
back door while the other fellow was in gaol. It
was a mean, low, beastly scheme, but sin generally
prospers in this world, and so the defendant was
locked up. And now in the visions of his dreams
upon his plank bed he sees a leering constable

or grinning at her over the back fence, and he lies
in a cold perspiration and asks where the thunders
of vengeance are stored, and if Nemesis is
altogether played out.

The very latest gubernatorial puff of the
new people who are about to move into
Government House, Sydney, is that Lady Jersey
“has a true woman’s heart.” We are now
anxiously awaiting advices touching her temper,
tongue, and other peculiarly womanly charac-
teristics.

The caretaker of the grounds of Melbourne
Gun Club has just been fined for cruelty to a
number of pigeons. This reminds us that certain
members and hangers-on of Sydney Gun Club
have not been fined, but have profited exceedingly
by their cruelty to a number of once gorgeous
“pigeons,” who have now not a feather to fly
with. Anyone who would hear an eloquent ser-
mon on the folly of backing the gun should learn
the life-histories up to date of certain “ flash ”
young monied Sydney fools who fancied they could
make money out of the Hebrews.

What is this noise we hear like the crack-
of a cocoa-nut? That noise, dear friends, is made
by the skull of a “ free ’’-labourer landing
“ whoosh !” on the pavement. He has just been
fired out by his grateful employer who, now that
he has done with him, pointed out that the so-called
two years’ engagement certain was all make-
believe.

Spagnoletti: “I object, on principle, to
Hospital Sunday. It is mainly a church-adver-
tisement, never thought of till the church was on
the down grade. Half the population don’t go to
church, so the scheme is half-and-half. Down
with charity altogether, supply it by taxation,
equally, and let’s have done with snuffle, Most
people give nothing, and there are those who give
more than they ought.”

“ Justitia ” (evidently a woman) Wants to
know how it is that so many men, who have
deserted and do not contribute to the support of
their wives and families, are retained in the
N.S. W. Government service ? The question is a
pertinent one.
* * *
There is serimlS trouble in Melbourne
between the Australian Natives’ Association
(male) and the Austral Salon (female). The Salon
is a shadowy and indefinite body with no par-
ticular object, and it is about as hard to fix as a
baseless assertion at the bottom of a pit; and the
Natives’ Association is a gathering without any
Visible purpose, which may be briefly described as
a sort of insane Moses after the light had gone
out. The Salon, however, has gone out of its way
to state that the average Native is an ignorant in-
dividual, blown up with his own conceit, and
vacant in his intellect, and it also hints that he is
lanky, vulgar, and incapable of any emotion, and
that he spends most of his time in passing resolu-
tions about his own greatness. Also, the Natives,
in their turn, are of opinion that the Salon is as
stupid as a shovelful of mud, and doesn’t know
enough to walk round a tree and find its way
homo again. As it is ungentlemanly to contradict
anybody, The Bulletin cheerfully accepts the
assertions on both sides.

Some lady cricketers seem to be training
down Richmond (Melb.) way, but the present
“form” of the angels is far from brilliant. The
bowling, as a rule, is about two yards off the wicket,
and if perchance a golden haired Spofforth manages
to put in a straight one, it is a case of “skirts
before” with the dimpled Murdoch, who never can
hit them when they come like that. A lack of
discipline is very apparent too, and the game
usually goes bung because everybody wants three
innings at once, or because they all want to go out
and field close to the solitary young man who has
wandered up to see the fun.
* # *
There is now an awful puzzle in Melbourne
over street-numbers. They have re-numbered the
city, but people are afraid to take off the old
numbers with which their businesses have been
long associated. Consequently nearly every place
has two numbers, widely different, and a source
of endless confusion.

What stupid things the parsons will say,

A miserable literary person at Bendigo
blew a poem out of himself on the occasional
Governor Hopetoun’s visit, and inflicted a copy of
the production on His Ex. The private secretary
forwarded the customary letter of thanks, and the

One of the most successful entertainments
of the year was given lately at a Victorian coup,
try town by the local branch of the A. N. A. The
branch being hard-upj it was resolved that every
lady should be required to pay for her ticket, and
as none of the ladies thought the Natives Worth
paying fr r there was a serious scarcity. One of
the Ideal barmaids turned up, for an enthusiastic
member had bought a ticket and given it to the
pretty girl at the hotel, and she had passed it on
to the ugly, red-headed girl with the bad temper
and the latter attended punctually. When she
realized the situation she called the principal
Native a thief and a monkey, and retired in dis-
gust. Then the members proceeded to waltz
wearily with each other, arid professed to be full
of hilarious mirth, but eighteen of them sneaked
off in the first half hour, and two had a fight, and
six got drunk, and at half-past nine the company
went home the back way and escaped into bed.

Now that the list of persons assisted by
the N.S. W. Relief Society during the late floods has
been published, it is openly stated that one of the
recipients drove to the local township in his buggy
to place his share of the spoil in the bank. This
man turns in an honest penny by letting monies
out at interest, Another recipient is the well-
known owner of some 40 head of horse-stock,
many of them being high-priced draught mares!

The latest pretty thing in feminine attire
is a green silk stocking with a serpent worked on it
in gold. The offensive beast is coiled round the
stocking, and his head is visible just above the
boot (which is at variance with the fact that snakes
descend trees tail-first). These circumstances are
presented without any attempt at comment. Our
soul is too full for utterance.

It seems extremely doubtful whether Lady

“Will Honeycomb,” taking his cue from

“Let him marry the gal! ” is the familiar

Melbourne girl lately surprised their Worships
amazingly. Bringing up a fellow for the support
of his infant son, she blankly refused his offer of
marriage, because she could not love a man who
had deceived her. This was quite out of the
depth of beakdom. She could give herself away
for love, but she could not sell herself for Respect-

Down in the Ballarat district a pair of
ardent lovers have tangled themselves up in a
religious difficulty which seems likely to terminate
fatally. He was a Roman Catholic, whilst she
was still clinging tight (spiritually speaking) to
John Wesley on the day when first they met.
They kept on meeting until the position of affairs
became harrowing to both parties, and they used
to weep over their diversity of faith and tear their
hair together by the light of the pale moon. It

was after one particularly humid leavetaking that
each of the lovers decided in secret to take up the
other’s religion and so remove the awful barrier
that had hitherto separated soul from soul. They
accordingly swapped beliefs and creeds unbe-
known to anybody, and then they wrote letters
desiring one another to meet at the old, old place
and come for a long, long walk, because they bad
something very particular to say. At the usual bliss-
ful hour they flew down to the trysting-place on the
wings of anticipation and exchanged hugs and
sweet mysterious glances on the usual liberal scale
until the maiden began to explain how she had
gone to the poll early that morning and plumped
for the Pope, whereupon the boy of her heart fell
upon the cold ground artel swote by John Wesley
that he wished he was dead, he did, because two
short oily brethren had snuffled him into their fold
on the previous everting- The fact that the old
barrier separates the young people worse than ever,
has laid then! both on beds of sickness, where they
will probably fade away like flowers unless the
spirit moves them to arise and flee to Atheism as
being the last refuge left them in the time of
trouble*

The Melbourne police have just, by some

possibility that a man who commits acts of pur-

centuries, but the law goes on sending the poor
wretches to the very place where their brain-

“ Pendragon ” gives the Heir-Apparent a
decided jar re His Highness’s alleged acceptance
of “benefactions” from that defunct toady, Sir
James Mackenzie, Speaking of the spurious
Mackenzie (who bought the name along with
certain Scotch estates) and the sneers that have
only appeared in print since his death, “Pen-
dragon ” says :—“ So far as his buying his way to
the smiles of a certain personage goes, it is, to my
thinking, far worse for a leader of fashion to
forget the obligations of his rank and position,
and become a pensioner and a parasite where he
ought to be a prince and a patron, than it is for
the successful trader or other parvenu who has
bis social ambitions to follow the shortest road to
their gratification.” Well, to The Bulletin’s
thinking, there’s nothing to choose between them.
What are the obligations of royal rank, judged by
the experience of ages past ? When was the
position of any prince other than the position of
a sponger ?

that in the next apartment, from vyhich they were

governess of a big neighbouring squatter, and who,
robbed of her slumbers and knowing them all
personally, could not fail to put down each witti-

bread of idleness accepted an engagement as can-

In the course of his duties he knocked at the door
of a dwelling in an Eastern suburb, and a lady
appeared who intimated that she was just then
dining. The canvasser passed on, but when some
distance from the house found himself collared by
a man who said he was a special constable, pro-
ducing his badge as proof, and arrested the can-
vasser. The latter was brought back to the house
and detained there till the special-constable had
finished his meal, then he was taken to the lock-
up and charged with “ knocking at my door.”

A N.S.W. police-magistrate was overheard

them.”
Within a few feet on one side of the splen-

Board !
Rev. Fraser was on the nail at the Sydney
Congregational Synod last week, in pointing out

The appointment of Mr. “ Teddy” Bramble
to the Telegraph-Inspectorship of the Northern
District of N. S. W., appears to be a good one.
“ Teddy” has no friends in high places, and hasn't
influence enough to secure the release of a vagrant
goat from the pound, but he is one of the very
best scientific electricians in the Australian public
service, and as a comic singer is second to nobody
in Sydney. The Bulletin is asking itself which
did the trick with the Minister—the singing or
the science?
Says the Queen of Roumania (Carmen
Sylva): “It is better to .confess to a physician
than to a priest. You tell the priest that you
detest mankind ; he replies that you are not a
Christian! The physician gives you a dose of
rhubarb, and thereupon you love your fellow-
creature.” Bah! Old Coroner Youl put it far
better twenty years ago : “ Many a man has been
plucked from the arms of Beelzebub and placed in
the bosom of Abraham by a blue-pill and a black-
draught.”
Marcus Clarke use 1 to tell an amusing
yarn about his friend, Clayton, the attorney, long
since departed. Clayton was hard as nails—a
regular marble or mahogany man—and ascribed it
to his practice of taking morning sun-baths i.c,,
perambulating, Adamite fashion, about a Garden
of Eden which he possessed beyond Oakleigh. He
persuaded Marcus to take a sun-bath, but they
were pulled up by hearing a ripple of silvery
laughter frqm-behind the bushes. Eves were out,
in full Parisian costume, of course, and narrowly
missed seeing the sun-bathers, wherefore Marcus
declared he wouldn’t sun-bathe nearer Melbourne
than Bullarook Forest.
Duncan Gillies, when Minister for Rail-
ways in the old anie-and-unti-Bevry Government,
had a penchant for champagne. He was affable in
those times, and used to “ include the reporter ”
singular number only—the Argus man. But
then every reporter who turned up used to say he
represented the Argus. If an Age man, con-
fessing himself such, showed his nose, it was—
“No, nothing to-day,” gruffly. But with Berry,
came Woods at the Railways, and exit Gillies,
Then arrived the Age men’s revenge. Woods,
like Patterson, stoked up with whisky, and secre-
tary Labertouche used to keep a watchful eye that
none but an Age man got behind the whisky-
screen. “ Those were the days!” sadly writes an
ex-reporter ; “ they tell me now that Gillies hoots
off—and almost hoofs off —any approaching press-
men. ”
The daily press is dangling as a frightful
example before the eyes of Unionists the body of

Dear Bulletin* —At Yetman police-court
(N.S.W.) on 21st Oct. 35 shearers —of which the
undersigned was one—were charged before Mr;
Lawson, P.M., and Messrs., W. Croaker and
Adams, Js.P., with unlawfully refusing to worki
Wo were fined £5 each, levy and distress, costs
4s 3d, and 3s professional costs ; in default 14
days. As one of the defendants expressed his in-
tention of serving the 14 days (or, as he put it,
“taking it out ”), Mr. Lawson stated that had he
been aware that any man had any intention of
“ taking it out ” he would have forfeited the whole
of the wages of all the men, and, he continued,
“if any of your number will not pay the fine, I
will do so nowand taking his watch from his
pocket and laying it on the table before him, said i
“1 now give you five minutes to decide, and
should you carry out your intentions I will now
forfeit the wages of every man.” The wages due
amounted to from £2O to £4O. When one of the
delegates gave notice of appeal theP.M. raised his
hand above his head and said (bringing his hand
flat on the table), “then plank down your
money.” Then the delegate planked it down
with a rap.— George Hawkins.
Is it Suicide?
Mark Twain tells the story : that at the inquest
held on the body of Buck Fanshaw- —who during
the delirium of a raging typhoid fever had taken
arsenic, shot himself through the body, cut his
throat, and jumped out of a four-storey window,
breaking his neck —the jury, after due deliberation,
sad and tearful, but with intelligence unblinded
by its sorrow, brought in a verdict of “ death by
the visitation of God.”
Buck undoubtedly committed suicide, and so
does every one who neglects the first symptoms of
approaching sickness and disease. Nature always
gives ample notice of any disturbance of physical
processes ; sometimes it is neuralgia, sometimes a
sharp shooting pain in the abdomen or side, or a
dull or throbbing headache ; no two persons get
the same symptoms. What you have to do is to
attack the first symptoms, for if consumption,
dropsy, cancer or Bright’s disease once gets a start,
you cannot stop its headlong course to the grave.
These are facts there is no disputing, for all the
medical skill in the world cannot do much for you
when real organic disease has set in.
We emphatically recommend Clements Tonic
because we know by personal experience and by
the evidence of influential and reliable people who
have used it that it will do good and prevent
disease. Clements Tonic is a medicine that
invigorates and strengthens the entire corporal
organism ; it does not only affect certain members
but strengthens the whole system, thus prevent-
ing the attacks of disease.
The Tumnt and Adelong Times says :
“ Clements Tonic certainly deserves the popularity
it has acquired, we have had proof positive, in
cases (under our notice) in this neighbourhood, of
its valuable properties.”
-Mr. T. Garrett, M.P., says, “I have taken
Clements Tonic with great advantage.”
Mr. John Plummer, (Fort-street Public School)
says, “Mrs. Plummer has frequently derived
great benefit from the use of Clements Tonic.”
Mr. S. IX Wood (Verger of All Saints Cathedral,
Bathurst), writes: “That he found Clements
Tonic a grand pick-me-up and it completely cured
him of low spirits, indigestion, giddiness and
humming noises in the ears.”
Mr. G. Swan, Junee Junction, who suffered
from debility, cardiac weakness and nervousness,
following on typhoid, took Clements Tonic and
says, “That after taking 6 or 7 bottles his health
was fully restored, and that he can now eat any-
thing and do any reasonable amount of work,
whereas before taking Clements Tonic he could do
none at all.”
Clements Tonic can be obtained from all medi-
cine dealers or from F. M. CLEMENTS, New-
town, Sydney.

cation to F. M. Clements, Newtown, N.S.W.;

On “dark nns”on “lavender,” “velvet” and “clover,”
Again have we been most delightfully “did.”
We’ve argued and quarrelled re “ morals” and “dead

And listened with awe to the fiend in the street
Whose repertoire chiefly consisted of “ red ’mis ”
With the wheezy finale, “Thanks, mine’s whisky,

We’ve cursed till the welkin is blue with profanity,
We’ve hurled at the tipsters much “ language ” insane ;
Of course, Ikey Moses’ chief trait is inanity,
But,somehow, he seems to have “got there” again.

There were thirty-nine starters, and Carbine won by three
lengths from Highborn, Oorreze being a length' away,
third, in 3min. 28Jsecs., a quarter-second faster than
Dunlop’s time in ’B7, hitherto the fastest on record. The
only thing that temporarily . reconciles an honest man to
the rotten state of racing matters, is the victory of a
heavily-weighted public favourite like Carbine.

The glories of vice-regality were decidedly off
colour at Flemington on Derby Day, but the sun shone
brightly all the same upon a large and fashionable Lawn
muster. Perhaps so many well-dressed and well-looking
women have never before shown up for the Derby display,
or perhaps it was that a slight reduction in the general
quantity brought the quality into greater prominence.
Anyhow, there was a dress rehearsal that promised a first
class show at the Cup, whereat the Oaringtons would
make their appearance and contribute a little necessary
“tong” to the Govingment ’Ouse party. Only in the
vice-regal box could the effects of the strike be detected
outside that sacred structure things wore an usually
festive aspect. A rise in the price of coal makes no odds
on a hot Derby Day, and if the people who usually punt
were content to let their “fancies” run loose because
business had been slack—well, that fact alone would
account for a considerable percentage of cheerfulness.
Even the successful backer is less jubilant than the man
who meant to have his pound on a loser but played for
safety at the last moment. It was wrong to say that the
Strike had made no difference to Flemington. It kept
hundreds from dropping their money quite as freely as of
yore.
# * #
The Admiral’s win was a triumph for public
form over public rumour. On paper-as The Bulletin
stated when discussing the Caulfield Stakes - nothing
seemed likely to beat Mr. Cook’s horse. Anon the
“ books ” betrayed a sinister anxiety to lay against the
apparent good thing, and so late as last Wednesday some
knowing individuals took odds that neither Titan, Gibral-
tar, nor The Admiral would start for the Derby. Whilst
the one favourite lost friends, the other—Annesley—gained
them, The Bulletin being of their number. The Ballarat
money came pouring in for the Neckersgat colt, until lie
threatened to start at nothing longer than 0 to 4. Then
The Admiral became very “ right,” and the people who
surmised that he was “wrong” had to eat their sus-
picions and seek comfort in the thought that he wasn’t
certain to beat the other horse, anyway. The public
favoured Annesley on the day, a circumstance which
shows how faith in Hales’ mounts has weakened since the
death of Mr. White. Had The Admiral been running in
the good old colours he would have gone to the post
even money chance.
* * *
After the event everybody knew that nothing
could beat the winner, yet many who saw the horse
•addled were disposed to think him less blooming, just
as they thought Annesley was more blooming, than on
the Guineas day, three weeks before. The latter, though,
never had his nose in front once during a slow run race,
and the cry that “ Neckersgats don’t stay” will not
explain his bad performance. Probably, Annesley is but
a moderate animal, and equally probably (this being
written before the Cup throws more light upon the
matter) the three-year-olds are moderate all round. The
ridiculous ease with which Carbine walked away from
Qresford and Loyalstone in the Melbourne Stakes, made
The Admiral’s victory at Caulfield seem smaller than it
looked at the time.
# # #
Whatever may have been the Derby field’s
“class” it is tolerably certain that the youngsters
saddled up for the Maribyrnong Plate were not brilliant.
None of them had been very highly tried, and public
opinion upon the whole crowd was indicated by the
betting-market. Harrington and Ascot, who had both
been beaten by the very mean-looking Submission at
Caulfield, were made favourites, merely because the
others—barring Yarran—had scarcely any followers.
Hales upon Corvette—wearing the arm-band usually asso-
ciated with a “second string”—was allowed to go out at
10 to 1, and nearly landed the filly (another Caulfield dis-
appointment) a winner. Betting' on a Maribyrnong Plate
has not been so light and languid for years past.
* * #
Chaldean walked around the paddock for an
hour or two on Derby Day, and, judging from what could
be seen.of him in his clothes, the horse would peel in
good condition for Tuesday’s race. Chintz looked very
so-so when stripped for the Stakes, and Melos was
generally thought to carry less muscle than he did a year
ago. Singapore moved more easily than usual, and may,
it the weather keeps warm, win a good race before the end
of the week.

Mr, “Titan” Brodribb pulled off some heavy
wagers on Saturday, and was understood to be a few
thousands in front at the end of the agony.

The Melbourne Cup is a noble institution for
the fatted bookmaker, but for the plentiful idiot
who backs the favourite and perpetually loses, and yet
returns to back another favourite next year, it. amounts
to very little. The whole history of the ( up, from its first
beginning nearly 30 years ago, is one long series of evi-
dences concerning the rampant insanity of trying to pick
a winner. The public commenced its fatuous career in
1861 by laying its shirt on Mormon, and when Archer
came in it went aVay cleaned out and disgusted. Next
year it piled its money on Archer, and was successful, but
as the odds were only 2 to 1 the profits were very humble,
while in 1863 all Australia went in and staked everything
down to the kitchen poker on the chances of Denmark and
Musidora, and when they were both left the nation
departed for home naked. Roebuck was the dead bird in
1864, and he went where the deceased fowl is always
going, and everybody was let in. Toryboy, who won in 1865,
was offered at 100 to 1 without takers, and the two animals
which carried all the money might as well have been head
so far aa their supporters were concerned. Next year a
long-suffering community bet Us immortal soul on Falcon,
and took the short road to the' Benevolent Asylum as
usual. Twelve months later four horses started on almost
equajly short odds, and by a special dispensation of
Providence one of them came in a winner, whereby the
shorn lamb didn’t lose much more than half its

and in 1868 they bet all they could raise on the winner of
It would have been all right if he had won, but he
didn’t, and Glencoe, who wiped him out, carried hardly
any money at all. Circassian, in 1869, was the surest

of. Pearl won in 1871 J and anybody could have got 100
to 2 about him. the day before the race, while two animals
that vyere backed for their weight in bank-notes perished
miserably. The favourite ran nearly last in 1872, while a
10 to 1 brute lumbered in victorious amid general curses
and execrations. The backers got a show in 1873, but in
1874 the crowd plunged madly at 2 to 1, and then a dis-
guised cqw, which carried not one cent upon itsheglectcd
back, took the stakes- People cursed a good deal, and
laid everything they had on Imperial next year at 5 to 2,
and another animal which was supposed to be only fit for
the catsmeat industry left the expensive horse far behind,
"he second favourite won in 1876, and the favourite—
j-hester—in 1877 ; and then, in 1878, the money was laid
m a heap on Melita, and when the despised Caiamia
reached the post the public was carried home on a shutter.
Lhe accumulated wealth was stacked on Sweetmeat and
Le Loup at the next Cup, but nobody thought of Darri-
well. ‘*nd everybody was left. Things improved a very
little in 1880, and then, in 1881, Darebin was the dead
hud of the year, and being a good deal too dead, Zulu
took the pool. Any odds could have been obtained about
him, but then nobody wanted odds on Zulu until
it was too late. The observations used this time were
a little worse even than usual, and the English language
broke down miserably for want of adequate blasphemy.
Assyrian, at 20 to 1, got home in ’B2, and the favourite burst
up as favourites almost always do. In ’B3 the public won
its money back on Martini-Henry, and in 1884 it piled the
winnings on Commotion, and when Malua was victorious
the result was general disaster. The miserable outsider,
Sheet-Anchor, took the pool next year, and about a dozen
horses that were dead certainties every one, never got a
show. Trident stood at 2tol in 1886, and Arsenal won.
Dunlop had been heavily backed on several occasions till
backers grew weary and disgusted, so in fBB7 he was
totally neglected, and with the inherent cussedness ®f the
horse tribe he triumphed on the only occasion when
nobody had any possible use for him. Mentor, the third
favourite, was the victor of ’BB, and then last year
Carbine and Melos divided all the money the nation could
spare, and the dead and forgotten Bravo extinguished
them both, and broke the bank for the twenty-sixth time.
* * #
And the moral of all this is that the horse is a
precarious animal, and backing is an insane superstition
unworthy of any white man’s consideration. Regarded
as a means of making money, it is more profitable to shoot
at a half-crown at 2000 yards’ range and lay even money
on hitting the coin in the centre, and as a measure of
economy it pays better to throw sovereigns through a
ladder on the understanding that the ones which stick to
the steps will be returned, while those that fall through
will be donated to the Imperial Institute. The public
bets largely on tips, and the man who gives the tip
generally knows nothing at all in the first place, and is
almost always a liar in the second. The owner himself is
almost as void of useful information as the rest of the
sporting community ; the jockey is just a trifle more
ignorant than the outsider—when he wins he always says
that lie knew it all along, and when he loses he can
always prove that some unforeseen circumstance spoiled
his chance; and, as for the horse, he probably knows
something, but he invariably keeps dark. And, conse-
quently, so far as the crowd is concerned, betting is—
with the single excerpt of hanging—the most unprofitable
speculation in the market. When the bookmaker goes
broke, as he does now and then, it is the wealthy horse-
owner who has cleaned him out; the mass of small specu-
lators merely empty their coin into a bottomless pit
who seldom gives more than 10 per cent of it back.
* * *
“There’s many a slip ’twixt the Cup and the
tip.”

“ Dunlop ” Donovan is the latest victim of the
Victorian land-boom. It would seem that he could have
been ruined in time on the turf, however, for he declares
that during his three years’ experience as a horse-owner
he lost as many thousand pounds.

The Admiral is the only colt who has won his

Alterations have been made on Fleming!on
Racecourse. The public on the fiat are pushed further
back, right behind the Steeplechase-running. The V.R.C.
is ready to die with vexation because its tenure of the
course won’t allow’ charging for general admission, as at
Caulfield. Wherefore the pauper public is to lie cribbed
and confined. Imagine the club getting 100,000 two bobs
for general admission to the Flat!

The Goddard-Dooley fight on Saturday night
in Melbourne is still another instance of the fallacy of
taking “ lines” from the performances of boxers. Peter
Jackson, against whom Dooley never had the ghost of a
show, was unable to hurt Goddard, whilst Dooley had all
the best of Goddard until his condition failed him. In
the third round he felled Goddard with a right on tlie
jaw, and Goddard only just managed to last the round
out. The minute’s spell pulled the giant together, and
Dooley falling w r eak in front of such terrible odds of
weight and brute strength (not to mention brutality), bis
seconds threw up the sponge at the end of the seventh
round. Poor Dooley is the most unfortunate man who
ever put on a glove, Just too small to hope to cope with
success against the giants, and just big enough to
exclude him from the middle-weights ; if he fights at all
lie has to tackle the big guns. Dooley, however, says he
can come down to middle-weight, and if he can do so
without weakening, he holds the middle-weight cham-
pionship of the world at his mercy. As to Goddard, a
fight to a finish between him and Slavin should be worth
an ear to see. It would be like a collision between two
locomotives at full tear. What a prospect of glaring eye-
balls and grinning teetli is involved (to change the meta-
phor) in a meeting between these two fine savages !
* * #
The pious and moral Melbourne Telegraph
complains bitterly about the Jackson-Goddard assault and
battery, the reason being that neither of the men seemed
any the worse. It sent a humble and merciful Christian
to make notes of the carnal encouter, and that person
expected to see the air darkened by hair and teeth and
pieces of human wreckage, and fancied that Jackson
would drive both his feet into Goddard’s chest, and that
Goddard would have his mouth full of Jackson’s scalp and
ears ; and as none of these things happened the Telegraph
felt hurt. It was surprised and disgusted to find that
neither of the combatants was carted away to the hos-
pital, and that the floor wasn’t strewn like the leaves on the
strand with eyes and vitals. It was ever thus with the
meek religious paper. The sort of thing it pines after is
a fight in a butcher’s shop between a cannibal and a bull-
dog, the defeated party to be eaten by the victor, and the
winner to be flayed alive and then ‘hung when the pro-
ceedings are over.
* * *
Goddard’s brother has beaten Slavin’s brother.
Would a meeting between the big guns take a similar
ending ? Goddard is just the stamp of man to compete
successfully against Slavin.
There is talk of Burge and young Sandy Ross
meeting, but it really seems a pity for the pair to smasli-
up good gloves on one another’s" granite skulls. About
the only thing that would make any impression on them
would be well-spiked Boz. knuckle-dusters. We charge
nothing for the suggestion.

Larry Foley has now an aldermanic binjie.
Nevertheless, it wus quite a treat to see him shape in front
of clever Jack Mollqy at the opening of the Australian
Athletic Club. Barring Jem Mace, the writer never saw
a man in Australia stand up to his work like the ex-
champion. Standing squarely to his man, not losing a
fraction of his height, with his left ready for a lead, and
the right playing loosely across the mark ready for stop
or delivery, Foley “shapes” in a style which the best of
our modern boxers might copy with advantage.

Vive le Sport! Rumour tells of u Western
enthusiast who recently gave a £5O trophy for a point-to-
point steeplechase. Five entries being received, the
trophy-donor entered five more, and won the prize “ like
a fine old sporting gentleman, one of the olden time.”

£2O to get up a day's racing for the shearers and scoops

Bay, was an old resident of Bathurst and largely identified

he had to say for himself, replied, pulling- out and ex-
hibiting a handful of totalisator tickets—‘ This is my
answer, gentlemen.-’ The answer, .too, was deemed satis-
factory, and young , well, young Johnny Arm-
strong, we will call him, might have been heard a few
minutes later telling his brother jockeys (who appeared
to chuckle at his smartness) that the stewards were a lot
of mugs, as all the tickets he held in his hand were on

THE BULLETIN (Published at Sydney, N.S.W)
The Unique Weekly, Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
The Bulletin, the Premier Australian Literary
Journal, is the only paper which has a con-
sistent and distinctive Australian National
Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Foi'm of Government,
Payment of Members.
One Man, one Vote.
State Revenue derived directly from the Land,
Complete Secularisation of State Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
The Bulletin denounces—
Religious Interference in Politics'.
Foreign Titles.
The Chinese.
Imperial Federation.
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the other half that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started seven years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become a vast property, because it pos-
sessed a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
ind follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have, during the
last year, spent some thousands of pounds in
fitting their buildings with the latest appliances
for high-class printing and the production of illus-
trations, and they have now issued The Bulletin
in an entirely new form-printed with new type
of improved legibility on the finest paper, and
adorned with sketches from the hands of the
ablest and best-paid newspaper artists Australia
has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The voice of The Bulletin is the beacon-fire
national progress : it is the forceful summons to
the crusade against the monopolies in land,
wealth, power, and privilege—the direct cause of
half the misery which now afflicts British
humanity. Against the claims of avaricious
clergy who claim to monopolise salvation, against
the dark despotism of grasping plutocrats, and
against the exercise of any human authority
which has not been granted by the people over
whom it is exercised, The Bulletin will fearlessly
and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the New Zealand
Ranges. A paper which is at once the
most popular city publication and the organ of the
ntelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
The circulation of The Bulletin in Sydney is
unrivalled by that of any other weekly journal,
and more than a hundred copies of it are sold in
Melbourne to one of any other paper printed out-
side that city. Perhaps the strongest proof of The
Bulletin’s popularity is found in the unchallenge-
able fact —easily ascertainable from any postal
official—that, of all journals issued in Australasia,
The Bulletin is the one most frequently re-
mailed from one reader to another.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

Tales of “The System,”
No. XVII.—“In Floggers’ Corner.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Floggers’ Curner at Sydney, Bathurst,
Newcastle and Moreton Bay. F logger’s Corner
at all other penal stations in His Britannic
Majesty’s prosperous and loyal Colony and De-
pendency of New South Wales in the year of
Grace, 183 . For, at the first mentioned places,
the Official Scourger was in the plural number;
elsewhere he was singular. Business was so brisk
at the Capital, the two leading country towns and
the Far North Settlement, that the Establishment
was under the necessity of putting two, and
sometimes three scourgers on its pay-sheets for
each of those centres of the reformatory activities.
At the smaller muster-stations and gaols, how-
ever, such as Wellington Valley, Goulburn,
Appm and Blackheath, one scourger’s services
sufficed to meet the ordinary demand for the
“cat. ’ Occasions of special pressure at the latter
points were met by “emergent engagements,” as
the official phrase ran.
The System worked most of its humbler hire-
lings altogether regardless of their requirements
of rest and recreation. It kept, for instance, a
convict constable on duty for 12 hours daily. But
those indispensable servants, the floggers, were
treated with a leniency approaching to loving
kindness. No scourger was asked to labour for
more than three or four hours on one day. His
muscles relaxed if exertion was demanded from
him for a longer period, and, though his temper
might grow fiercer and his will more fixed in the
faithful performance of his duties, an increasing
ferocity of disposition was worth nothing if his
arm grew weaker and his blows lighter. There-
fore it was understood (and specifically ordered)
that Messieurs the Scourgers should not be over-
taxed.
They could not do justice to their task, if they
were over-worked. The first recorded occurrence
of a strike in connection with any A'hstralasian
industry was the refusal of Dougherty, the illus-
trious Hobart Town hanger and scourger, who,
haying been actively engaged in whipping
prisoners from “sun-up” to noon one day,
objected to continue the pleasant duty into the
afternoon on the ground that “his strength
wasn’t equal to it.” And on the circumstance
that Mr. Dougherty was never thereafter requested
to exert himself after his mid-day lunch was,
according to scourgers’ tradition, founded the
System’s tenderness to their class. Dougherty had
induced the System to perceive that “it was as
bad as killing the goose that lays the golden
eggs” to work a fiogger to the extreme of
exhaustion, for what the dickens was the
good of sentencing a prisoner to be stripped
and whipped if the scourger was incapable
of inflicting punishment?” Which quoted sen-
tence the gentle and, humane reader will under-
stand is not the present writer’s, but is composed
of the ipsissima verba of a highly-esteemed Sys-
tematiser— E. A. Slyde, Esq., Police Magistrate
of Sydney, and inventor of the “improved cat.”
Slyde was a religious man and a churchman of St.
James’, but the Cross claimed but the smallest
share of his devotion. He preferred to swing the
censer of his adoration before the triangles. A
brilliant son of the System was Slyde; and it was
owing to his keen perception of things as they
should be that the regulation forbidding the over-
working of scourgers passed the Executive
Council.
*# * .
By virtue of that regulation the apostrophe
at Bathurst was shifted; and Fiogger’s became
Floggers’, and Mr. Cracknecke, Artist in the
Scarification of Prisoners’ Backs, received the
reinforcement of Mr. Chuckem’s services.
Both had been kept pretty busy for many weeks
prior to that August Monday when the Bathurst
Magistrates held their Field Day,* and their
muscles and limbs were, consequently, in fine
order. The former, in their admirable tension
were strung to concert-pitch, and the latter were
superbly flexible. The fiogger, who knew Ids
business, didn’t operate with only one part of Ids
body, and one particular set of muscles. In
rotation he brought several different parts into
play. Now it was the wrist, which inspired the
blow ; now it was the fore-arm; now it was the
tendons of the back that had to bear the strain.
By thus changing the seat of propulsive force, the
Artist in butchering was not only enabled to
economise his strength, but could inflict a distinct
variety of pain on the subject of his skill. Work-
ing from the fore-arm only, a scourge could do
nothing but lacerate the back and right side.
Utilising the wrist, he could introduce some
charming variations —we are speaking the lan-
guage of the System—of touch and going design.
And if he possessed a pliant waist, he commanded
the one remaining facility necessary to the reduc-
tion of the culprit’s exposed flesh to a mass of
palpitating pulp,
# * #
Cracknecke and Chuckem knew their busi-
ness. Cracknecke had taken to the vocation as a
duck to water. He was a born scourger. Chuckem,
on the other hand, though now an unquestionable
proficient, had to acquire excellence by degrees.
When he was appointed to Bathurst as Mr.
Cracknecke’s assistant, his touch was, in his
chief’s opinion, crude and inartistic.
“Yer not too proud ter take er ’int, beyer,
Chuckem ?” asked Mr. Cracknecke of his new
subordinate.
“Not a bit, sir, ’’ replied Chuckem, who viewed
Mr. Cracknecke with the becoming appreciation
of spirit which modest novices in an art should
regard its great masters. “Too ’appy, sir, if
yer’ll be so good,”
“Ri’te yer are, sonny, don’ be ’bove lamin’.
Now, w’en th’ nex’ cove’s up furmed’sun I’ll show
yer ’ow ter click outer his ribs. Yer rather weak
there, Chuckem.”
The next time a poor devil was “ up” for such
hygienic comfort as could be administered by the
cat-o’-nine-tails (his “dose” was “a Botany Bay
dozen” — Anglice, twenty-five lashes) Mr. Chuckem
Was the chastening agent of the day. but Mr.
Cracknecke generously abandoned some of his
well-earned leisure to the supervision of the new
hand’s efforts. , .
Mr. Cracknecke’s speech before the flogging
began was affluent with suggestions, and lie
stopped the punishment twice or thrice in order
to emphasize attention to a particular point-
“ Yer fitting too high, Chuckem.” “ Yer wastin’
yer tails, Chuckem—yer on’y fitting wi’ six or
seven.” “Yer fitting too low, sonny—yer a-
catchin’ him on his legs, an’ he don’ feel so
much, Chuckem. Besides, trousers is Gov’munt
pmp’ty, an’ yer mus’n’ destroy Gov’munt prop’ty,
Chuckem.” These were some of the gems that
coruscated in Mr. Cracknecke’s talk, and so
precise, so educative were they, that it is sur-


every HOUSEHOLD—especially where
there are young cnilrtren—should be provided

However, Mr. Cracknecke thought he would

The man at the triangles had received his full

dance, 1 but if the prisoner agreed it was no concern
of this official.
As Crackneoke spoke the tnced-up victim bowed
his head on his shoulders. A humane observer
would have attributed the action to the fact that
he had fainted, but Mr. Crackneoke took it for a
s i<ni of assent ; and showed his promising pupil
how to nick strips of skin from the region of the
ribs. Fi ve or s ' x mol ' e blows—and Crackneoke,
making every tail tell, had left 50 or 00 cuts on

S °Mrf George Suchor, of Baulkham Hills, grazier,
thought there ivas something peculiarly disgusting
in the incident above related, and reported the
batch of Bathurst officials to the Colonial Secre-
tary. And what do you think, O tender-hearted
reader who is loth to believe that such things took
place in Sunny New South Wales half a century
(and less) ago, was the result? Was Mr. Suchor
thanked? Were the Assistant - Superintendent,
who directed the scourging, and the constable
who counted the lashes, dismissed ? Were they
ever reprimanded? Were Messrs. Crackneoke
and Chuckem- reduced from the Staff to the iron-
gang? If you think any of these things happened,
dear reader, all we have to say is that you didn’t
know the System. . „ ,
Mr. Suchor was assured by someone in Sydney
who declared over an undecipherable signature
that he had the honour to be his, Mr. Suchor’s,
most obedient servant, how extremely obliged the
Authorities would be if Mr. Suchor would only
mind his own business !

We have purposely made the foregoing
digression from the main current of our narrative
in order that there shall not be the slightest
doubt as to Messrs. Crackneoke and Chuckem’s
competency for the task of distributing 1825 lashes
as per order of the Bathurst Bench.
Eighteen hundred and twenty-five lashes !
Nine times 1825 equals 10,425. Sixteen thousand
four hundred and twenty-five distinct outs to be
deposited on the pulsing bodies of between thirty
and forty of His Majesty’s subjects! — a heavy

Evil Deities! —Messrs. Crackneoke and Chuckem
are equal to it.

The triangles stood in the comer of a
spacious yard. Facing i t was the entrance-gate
which opened on to the path leading to —and
from—the Court House. Three sides of the yard
were enclosed by a brick wall. The fourth was
bounded by the Superintendent’s house, two
windows of which overlooked that grassy Male-
bolge.
The hideous tripod was erected in the centre of
of an almost bare plot, twenty yards square, it
might be, in area. Its legs were young gums of a
foot’s girth, sunk three feet into the earth. Their
projecting ends were bound together with hoop-
iron. Lashings of the fibrous kurvajong or the
English hemp might do for smaller places, but
here, where the Sconrgef was a permanent institu-
tion, iron held the triangles together. Had hemp
been used, constant writhings would necessitate a
frequent replacement of the rope. A cross-bar of
six-inch batten held two of the legs together.
Floggers’ Corner was almost bare. The rest of
the yard, save the pathway, was from year’s-end
to year’s-end a grassy glory. You, dweller in the
Bathurst of the present, know that delightful
sward that is before your stately Law Courts—
how delightful it is to the eye and to the touch of
the foot. But it is nothing—as old visitors who
date from the thirties will tell you—to the yield-
ing verdure that carpeted the Punishment Yard
from the “ Super’s. ” wall to the line of holes on
the margin of Floggers’ Corner,
Floggers’ Corner was almost bare. Not com-
pletely so, for springing up between the sloping
Ifgs of the triangles were huge tufts of gristly
grass. They had escaped the scythe in the mowing
season ; the knife could not sweep between the
legs, and thus year by year clumps of thin, shiver-
ing, reddish stalks lingered in the blasting shelter
ot the skeleton structure. It is no fancy that
confers a blood-tint on their blades, but sober
fact. Whether it was that it imbibed from the
ghastly showers, which fed it constantly, some of
their ruddiness, or whether it was that subtle
quality which naturalists call mimicry, and which
leads many a plant to take upon itself the hue of
its surroundings, one cannot say; but certain it is
that the grass in the Corner gleamed with a dusky
blood-red, and not with the fresh verdancy of the
other portion of the Yard.

On this August morning the first blush of
an early spring had fallen upon the enclosure. A
petulant rain had ushered in the day and with it
had come the beautiful new year. An elm in the
angle next the super’s house that, yesterday, was
rude and sharp against the western sky, now sent
forth countless tiny shoots, and upon every dimi-
nutive point glistened a trembling diamond. From
the luminous wet of the grass walk peeped specks
of colour, the vanguard bannerets of the coming
host of wild flowers. In a box on the sill of the
superintendent’s window the minature volcano-
cups of the crocus were bursting into bright gold.
And over all, the delicious warm air hung with a
rapturous buoyancy that lifted up the soul as does
the sightless song ”of the lark. Even into the
noggers hearts penetrated some of the priceless
beauty of the new-born Spring.
Lor ! ” said Cracknecke, as he was tying up
the assigned man of Thomas Coxon, Esq,, J.P.
Am tit a stunner of a mornin’. Ido feel in
good trim to-day !”
* * *
A “stunner ” the day was, and he proved
,„ a “stunner,” too, before the final
I ally! was shouted by the constable. And
F 1 n °bly _ did Assistant Chuokem second the
brilliant achievements of his superior. Surgeon
Come had witnessed many scourgings before
that morning, and many a score afterwards. But
he marked that day with a white stone in his
calendar. The workmanship was of unsurpassable
excellence!
.Did Mr. Cracknecke tickle one man’s ribs to
perfection, Mr. Chuckem “ kissed ” great wheals
on the same part of the next culprit’s anatomy
with an equal facility. For Chuckem, you must
be informed, had bettered his master’s tuition in
one branch of the art. As a rib-tickler, the
Establishment had not another like him.
, They relieved each other as each “dozen” was
tallied by the Constable.
Did Mr. Chuckem score parallels on the shoul-
Ti,? rS T 1 ' ns first twenty-five out of a “ hundred,”
Mr. Cracknecke gashed the lower back with equal
symmetry. Did Mr. Chuckem cross, for the third
twenty-five, his former cuts with an approxima-
tion to accuracy, Mr. Cracknecke in the last
‘dozen,” would go one better. He would attain
accuracy, and traverse the marks he had previously
left so correctly that if you had measured one of
the minute squares which he had cut on the flesh
you would have measured nearly all.
Did the Senior cut up, the Junior cut down.
And the jets of blood gushed as profusely for the
latter as tor the former. Did the Superior change
the cut from his right-hand to left in the middle
of a current “dose,” the Subordinate would follow
suit. Leading off with his right, he would finish
his dozen with the native grace of a left-hander.
And there _ was practically nothing to choose
between their respective expertnesses.
It was altogether a fine performance! And not
the least admirable feature about it was the
absence of every mean element from their rivalry.
What Chuckem lost by an inartistic touch on the
shoulders or small of the back, he erained on the
ribs. He did not envy Mr. Cracknecke, and the
latter gentleman was of too magnanimous a
nature to view his assistant’s success with a judi-
cial eye.
When they adjourned for lunch, at 1 p.rn., they
had completed more than half of the day’s work,
and had polished off nearly all the morning batch
of offenders.
As they were passing out of the gate to the
Ordnance quarters, where they were to refresh
themselves, Dr. Corrie tossed them a shilling a-
pieced
“Here, lads,” he said, “get three fingers at
Mother Dillon’s. You’ve done splendidly this
morning, by George, but the magistrates, I hear,
will have some more for you this afternoon, so
keep your strength up. Hope you don’t feel
tired ?”
“Speakin’ fur mysel’, doctor,” Answered Mr.
Cracknecke, pulling his forelock in gratitude for
the tip, “I’m as fit as a fiddle.”
“Same ’ere, sir,” echoed Chuckem; “I ain’t
turned an ’air.”
The doctor nodded appreciatively, and, casting
a last glance around—perhaps to gain a whet for
his appetite—went likewise to his meal. He saw,
between the tripod, the spikes of grass glistening
red in the gay sunlight; from the spot where the
victims had stood five, six, seven narrow runlets
of ruby fluid going this way and that way ; frag-
ments of skin and morsels of flesh dotting the
Corner and decorating the lawn. His eye, prac-
tised in the niceties of surgery, even perceived a
minute section of a sinew lying, a quivering fila-
ment, on the beaten ground. He picked it up,
intending to use it for a microscopic object, and
placed it carefully in his pocket-book. And then
he went home for his midday refection and growled
at Mrs. Corrie because she gave him cold corned
beef. “I haven’t a proud stomach,” he com-
plained “but I do object to corned beef four
times a week.”*
# * *
Operations were resumed about 2.15 p.m.
The remanets of the morning charge-sheet were
cleaned off by two or three hundred dexterous
and sinistrous strokes, and the experts in torture
were granted a short spell. The doctor had got a
hint from inside the Court-house that the prin-
cipal afternoon “ case” was conducting himself
outrageously, and it was suggested to Corrie that
he should prepare the floggers accordingly:
“Boys, you’d better get the pickle-tub from the
Super’s yard, and wash your bats. There’ll be a
tough customer for you shortly. He’s a raw ’un,
too.” A “ raw ’un” was a prisoner whose acquain-
tance with the whip lay still in the future.
The men proceeded to obey the command) and
went round to the shed at the rear of the Superin-
tendent’s house, where the brine-tub was kept for
convenience sake. “ Mrs. Fry’s ’Liz,” the Super’s
nurse, was crossing the yard as they wete return-
ing. “Mrs. Fry’s Liz” had a history. She was
one of the women received at the Portsmouth
hulks from Cardigan Gaol with hoop-iron riveted
round the waist, wrist and ankles, and the great-
hearted lady had entertained fervent hopes of
Liz’s ultimate reformation. But Liz had been
sent to Mrs. Gordon’s lazar-house at Parramatta—
the System called the institution the Female
Factory and House of Correction—and after
her tutelage there the biggest fool of a Penal
Reformer who ever lived would not have given a
brass farthing for Liz’s reputation.
Liz hailed the scourgers, who were very old
friends of hers and attached to her by many ties
(Cracknecke had saved her once at the Factory
when he was Parramatta flogger, and she had led
a mutiny), with a gay “ Good day, mateys. Wot’s
the tub for?”
“ We’ve got a raw ’un to tickle,
An’ we’re a-goin’ th’ cat ter pickle,”
sang Mr. Cracknecke with a facetiousness that
would have done honour to the great Vance.
“Are yer, boys? Blest if I don’t bring th’
brats to look on. Th’ Super, an’ th’ Missus is at
Dimdale. The Snowlees’ givin’ a big dance to-
night.”
“Yes, do, Sis,” said Chuckem. “Th’ sooner
th’ kiddies Jams th’ System, the better.”
“Givin’a big dance, is they,” laughed Crack-
necke. “Wal, ol’ Snowlee’s made a lot o’ his ’ands
dance th’ ’ornpipe orlre’dy ter-day ! ”
By the time these “ brethren of the flagellant
persuasion ” (as John Macarthur once termed the
Official Scourgers, over the walnuts and the wine)
had got their tub and their cats properly soused
in the thick brine, the “raw’un” was waiting
their pleasure.
* * *
Dickson (as he called himself) or Dilby (as
Mr. Snowlee, J.P., had induced the Bench to
proclaim him) had been ordered 200 lashes.
Claiming to be a “ free ” man, Snowlee contended
he was an absconding convict, and in addition to
being sentenced to return to the iron-gang from
which, it was alleged, lie had escaped, the flogging
was inflicted for the triple offence of threatening a
magistrate, “refusing to answer truly certain
interrogatories as to his penal condition,” and for
committing a contempt of court. He had been
grossly violent in manner and speech in the
presence of the magistrates, and as he was hauled
out in the sunshine he still struggled and shrieked
furiously.
However, his strength appeared to leave him
when he was brought face to face with the
triangles. As the scourgers stripped him, the broad
hairiness of his chest heaved mightily with the
last throb of his spent passion, and then he fell,
limp and spineless, between the legs of the
machine.
The scourgers dragged him to his feet. He
threw himself down again crying, “God, have
mercy ! ” They pulled him up once more. “Be
a man, sonny,” said Mr. Cracknecke; “don’ be
beaten afore th’ cat touches o’ yer.”
They bent his hands together in their strong
grasp and passed their cord round his wrists pre-
paratory to binding them to the point of the
tripod. They pulled the string so tightly that it
cut the flesh. The pain revived his courage. He
drew himself together, filled his lungs with a great
in-take of breath, and, with an effort that thrust
knobs and gnarls of muscles on to the surface of
his back and limbs, snapped the cords. Dashing
his right fist into Cracknecke’s face he leapt
towards the gate. He Had covered the twenty
yards which lay between the entrance and Floggers 1
Corner when the soldier who stood sentinel
there, flung his musket across the aperture.
He overturned the soldier in a second, but
the momentary delay bad served the cause
of Law and Order very well indeed. It gave
another man of the military guard—one sergeant
and eight privates were on duty—time to recover
from his share of the astonishment into which
Dilby , alias Dickson’s bolt had thrown the group
of officials and spectators. He fired at the escapee,
and the bullet, at less than thirty yards’ distance,
could scarcely fail to miss its mark. It brought
the prisoner down.
Corrie went to the groaning, bleeding wretch to
examine him. “In the shoulder; it’s nothing
serious ; punishment can go on,” was his decision.
And it went on.
* * *
The blood flotved copiously fot soine
minutes from the bullet-wound and bedyed the
wretch’s naked flesh and trousers by the time
they had fixed him tip for his dose.
Craoknecke tore a sleeve ofit of the victim’s shirt:
the garment was not “ Gov’meht prop’ty,” so there
was no objection to his destroying it; and, dipping
the cotton in the pickle-tub, washed the gore away.
“ I’m goin’ ter do th’fancy trick, doctor,” he
said, viciously, “Air I Wan’a clean sU’face ter
Work on. ”
That drive in the face of Scourger Cracknecke
proved a most ill-advised proceeding of prisoner
Dilby. To the fire of Mr. Crackneeke’s artistic
delight in his work the blow had added the fuel of
a personal insult. Even a Scourger had moral
feelings that would be outraged by a blow. The
System admitted that much. What the Sys-
tem would never admit was that a prisoner had
any moral sensibilities,
Scourger Cracknecke worked his fancy trick to
admiration. He embellished the “ surface ” with
three strips of hanging cuticle, and by the deftest
of wrist-actions left one huge drop of thick gore
gleaming on the top of every pendant of skin.
Not more than half a dozen of the scores of
scourgers attached to the Penal Establishments
of N.S.W. and V.D.L. could compass that deed.
The mastery of a cool, calculating brain over a
pliant hand, and the exquisite delicacy of touch _
which dug each cracker of the nine-tails into the
human flesh, and in the same movement peeled
downwards nine strips of cuticle, were powers
rarely possessed. Cracknecke had them to per-
fection. With three successive fang-like strokes of
the whip he had punctured the back with the
triple row of holes, had withdrawn the single
clots, and left the hanging shreds of skin to
shrivel and curl.
“Lor !” exclaimed Chuckem, in an ecstacy of
admiration for his chief’s prowess, “I gives yer
best now, Mr. Cracknecke. I couldn’t come near
thet if I ’ed a show !”
The rows of hanging skin-strips had been
lifted several times by an upward stroke of the
lash ; a gust of the rather chilly breeze had also
rustled them once or twice; and the flesh on the
shoulders and ribs was rising in deep, corrugated
ridges before Dickson gave mouth to his agony.
But once his fortitude broke down, Heavens !
the heart-rendering poignancy of his cries, the
furnace-glare of his hollow eyes, the terrible con-
tortions of his body ! Again and again he threw
himself against the cross-bar ; again and again it
seemed as though his lower limbs, fastened as
they were with thin cords to the legs of the
triangles, would burst their bonds ; again and
again the tripod was on the very verge of
being uprooted from its socket; again and again
he cried for mercy, invoked God, Christ, the
Devil!
Let him writhe and shriek as he will there is no
mercy nigh unto him. At least, so it seems. For
Cracknecke finishes his first twenty-five, and
Chuckem his first twenty-five ; and Craoknecke
relieves Chuckem, and Chuckem Cracknecke;
and still the constable shouts his “ Five-ten—
fifteen— twenty — tally/” and still Dr. Corrie goes
up, as each “dozen ” is tallied and feels his pulse
and nods to the flogger ! Mercy ! Ah, no ! Not
if the System knows it!
And yet it would seem, too, that as there was
mercy for the thief on the cross, so there is mercy
for the victim knotted to the triangles.
For, at the one-hundred-and-twenty-first blow—
while the cat was still swirling with a dreadful
hiss through the air—while Cracknecke’s body was
still swinging round the hole in which the flogger
placed his heel to gain a greater purchase for his
stroke —while Dr. Corrie was just forming the
conclusion that the prisoner was “ going to see it
through ’’—-while Chuckem was making up his
mind to imitate the famous fancy trick on the
man’s ribs—while these things were severally
happening, Dickson’s head fell backwards, and
his silent but frothy lips showed he had fainted.
Cracknecke —we will do him justice^-tried to
check his blow, but he was throwing such an
enthusiastic force into his work that he could not
do so. The swirling cat fell on the upturned face.
“ Cast him off,” cried Corrie, The doctor was
as humane as the System made ’em; and he did
not believe in cutting a man’s face to bits. A
back, yes ! A face, no !
A grim silence fell on the loathsome group, as
many hands fumbled and bungled at the knots.
It was broken by merry, childish laughter, and
the delicious lisp of baby accents, perfectly audible
in the clear air :
“ Oh, p’itty, p’itty !”
All looked round. From the Super.’s windows
were gazing with rapt eagerness and a joyous light
in face and eye, the Super’s children, and the
youngest, a baby-boy, was dancing in the arms of
nurse Liz, and doing its best to carol an encore for
the pantomime which had charmed it, and its
brothers and its sisters, so greatly.
Well, what can you expect I If you put Cherubs
♦Possibly, (but I am not sure) Mr. Corrie’s fastidious-
ness as to “ corned beef” may have had some relation to
the fact that, when a prisoner was flogged with a oat
newly-soused in brine, he was said, in convict slang, to
be “corned-beef.”— Author.

Before Messrs. Cracknecke and Chuckem
fin illy pickled their cats that evening, they added
to the 225 lashes they had already given Mr.
Coxsan’s assigned man, his final 25. He took
them like a lamb. “Yer needn’t stay for me,
doc., he said to Dr. Corrie, “I ain’t a-goin’ ter
faint.” “ I have no intention, my man,” plea-
santly answered the surgeon, “ I’m not supposed
to supervise a flogging for less than fifty. This 25
forms no part of your last lot, you know—it is a
separate sentence and stands by itself.” Punc-
tilious Dr. Corrie!
The twin scourgers were clearing up before seek-
mg the sweet sanctity of their quarters. Chuckem,
with a besom, had brushed together a heap of
ghastly fragments.
“Yer can save yoursel’ th’ tru’ble, Chucky,”
said Cracknecke; “look at them ’ere ants.” A
countless host of these diminutive but exemplary
creatures were already banqueting on the viands
provided for them by the tender solicitude of the
System.
And the two worthies left the results of their
labours to the ants and a butcher’s dog, who
lapped in the runlets. As they wended their way
to the Ordnance Barracks they impressed very
palpable footprints on the sands of time and .on
the Bathurst pathways. For, no more than their
victims, could they keep their feet from being
soaked with blood. It oozed out of their boots as
they walked.
# * *
One last word. When, a month later,
Dilby (as the System contended he was— Dickson,
ns he said ho was) was presented the
most lamentable of objects ! —to the Overseer oi
Appin Road-gang as an absconder, that official
declined to receive him. He would have only
been too happy to oblige the Bathurst magis-
trates, he intimated, by accepting Dickson
as the escaped convict Dilby, but, really, he
couldn’t! He had himself recaptured the real
Simon Pure—the veritable Dilby— a week prior to
Dickson’s flogging. That was why.

Several of our contemporaries persist in
speaking of “ the may on the Snakes of Ireland
which left off by saying : ‘ There are no snakes in
Ireland.'” Asa matter of fact, the reference is
to a hook on Iceland (we forget by whom; it is

heading the sentence: “There are no snakes in
Iceland ” stood alone in its glory.
John Ward, a working-man candidate for

“Well,” said Ward (a great, bluff artisan), “I

I shall stand on the floor of the House, and as the
evening draws on I shall say, ‘ Mr, Speaker and

Ten years on the treadmill wouldn't sufficiently

Says Hugh O. Pentecost
Now that the great strike is in everybody’s mind, it is a
good time to get one thought clearly defined. It seems
to me undeniable that an employer of labour should Con-
tend for the right to hire or discharge any employe
according to agreement made between the employer and
the as individuals. The idea that an outsider
should have the right to meddle in any way with such a
transaction is absurd. If this cannot now be done, as it
cannot, without injustice and suffering to the employe, it
is because the employed is at a disadvantage with the em-
ployer. That disadvantage arises from the fact that the
cannot get at land to support himself. It vacant
land were free the employe could at least support himself,
and if money and trade were free he could, without an
employer, live in luxury. What needs to be done, then,
is to make vacant land, money', and trade free. A labour
organisation is mere child’s play. It call do nothing
while the is at such a hopeless disadvantage with
the employer.
Editor Bulletin. Sir, —In the Queen r.
Harvey, the prisoner was convicted of inflicting
grievous bodily harm. The N.S. W. Full Comt
quashed the conviction on the ground that the
prisoner inflicted grievous bodily harm without
intent. In the Queen v. Bennett, decided on
Friday, the prisoner was convicted of the same
offence as Harvey. The Full Court upheld the
conviction on the ground that the prisoner in-
flicted grievous bodily harm without intent. Both
prisoners were convicted under the 24t!i section of
the Criminal Law Amendment Act. Is this in-
telligible or arguable? Peaceful but playful
citizens beware ! If the time of the Court was
taken up for two hours “ wantonly, wilfully and

&c., A Puzzled Lawyer’s Clerk. Nov. 3, 181)0.
It appears that not even the magnificent
rent-roll of young Earl Dudley (who was in Aus-
tralia a little while ago) supplemented though it
be by the savings of a long minority, can keep
pace with the rate at which the young Earl is
living. The proceedings in the Dublin Nisi Prius
Court, when a Mr. Daly obtained a writ against
the Earl of Dudley, could take no one by surprise
who had followed the courses of the young man
since he attained his majority. “ Hardly a week
has passed without his spending thousands upon
horseflesh alone; and, as a rule, he has been
sigularly unlucky in his purchases. The writ is
issued in connection with Royal Meath, a horse
Lord Dudley bought in Paris for £7OOO from Mr.
Daley, He has already paid £2OOO, but finds
difficulty in raising the other £5OOO. Mr. Daly
refused to wait, hence the present action. The
Earl is, however, far too rich a man for there to
be any fear of things being allowed to go to ex-
tremities.”
Visiting Adelaide, the saintly appearance
of George Walpole Leake, Q.C., ex-P. M. and ex-
Judge, of Western Australia, has secured him the
offer of a captaincy in the Salvation Army. As
drummer “George” would more ably fill the bill,
for his aldermanic bread-basket would keep the
drum in perfect position. As Police Magistrate
and Judge in W.A. “George.” though always
feared, was never loved ; but as a wit, whether on
or off the Bench, he shone with a brilliancy
peculiarly his own. Once, however —it is the only
time on record—the old wag was Caught tripping
and completely floored. He was trying an ine-
briate named Thomas Green, and the name of the
culprit proved to him an overpowering temptation
to perpetrate a pun. “Thomas Green, ’ he said,
in lazy, careless tones, “you are charged with
being drunk, and,” he then added, “ I must say
you are very f/rccn to be here. ’ (Roars of
laughter.) Then the half-dazed, bleai-eved,
hoarse-voiced man in the dock leaned out of the
prisoners’-box and ejaculated ; “Yes, yer wuship,
Him green, and p’raps Him very green, but,
dash my buttons, Hi'm not has green has a leek.'-
“Dismissed, with a caution,” was the magistrate s
laconic reply. After that, George Walpole Leake
would as soon pick a pocket as make a pun in
court.
There is still living in W.A. an individual
bear in" the solrl'/iut of “ Moondync doe." who
was regarded, in the hoy-day of his convict-life,
as the champion prison-breaker of the world.
“ Joe ” has been immortalised in a novel written
by the late John Boyle O’Reilly, who. was his
fellow-prisoner ; and, truly, his numerous and
wonderful escapes from the “jug” have scarcely
a parallel in history. His would-be keepers even
put him in an iron cage for safe custody ; but the
iron cage was found empty one fine morning and
the gaol-bird flown. “ Moondyne,” like many of
his fellow-convicts, was the victim of cruel official
tyranny. Once he made a real clock out of card-
board —an exquisite piece of mechanism. The
warders saw it and hauled him before the prison
magistrate, who found him guilty of “ destroying
Government property,” and added six weeks to
his sentence. The “Government property re-
ferred to was three-quarters of a pound of old card-
board /
That poor little withered royalty, Albert
Victor, though he was born only a few
years ago, is already showing signs of extreme
old age, and fears are entertained that he will
break up from senile decay and leave a father and
a number of comparatively yuupg ancestors to
lament his loss. Then some time after he is gone
liis distracted parent will probably succumb to the
load of accumulated years and perish from second
childhood and other natural causes ; while the
Imperial grandmother of the family ploughs along
serenely in search of her next jubilee. It is one
of Victoria’s peculiarities that she is a great deaf
younger than most of her posterity. Wales, in
particular, looks as if he was his own grandfather
by mistake, and was weighed down by the innu-
merable responsibilities of his unnatural situation
as the remote predecessor of his mother and the
rest of the family.
The English people will, as The Bulletin
has long predicted, yet look with contempt and
disgust upon the very name of Brigand Stanley.
But then the J. Bull family are so dull-witted,
prosaic, egotistical, and greedy a lot that they
have simply been [marked out by Nature as the
perennial victims of hypocrisy. The mean, brutal,
pitiless face of Stanley alone ought to have been
enough, leaving his revolting egotism out of the
question, to proclaim him a fraud when lie began
to “ gag ” how he read the Bible in the wilderness
and what a mercy and a comfort it was to him.
Yet, as the British public unquestioningly accepts
as the accredited representatives- of the shoeless
and hungry Christ whom it pretends to adore, a
lot of paunchy impostors with thick underlips and
smug faces that are mere coloured maps of glut-
tony and greed and self-indulgence; a,s it has for
hundreds of years paid toll and tribute to a horde
of fat and insatiable vampires who travel in the
name of self-denial and charity—it is no wonder
that they, who worship at the feet of an unspeak-
ably dull and ignoble set of bogus gospel-mongers,
should fall easy victims to the wiles of a calculat-
ing Welsh-Yankee news paper-man-book-agent
who has sized ’em all up to a nicety. Ihe state-
ments made by Troup and others as to the ivory
business are but the beginning of the arch-hum-
bug’s downfall.
Duncan Gillies received Munro’s brief
notice of motion- “That this House-lus no confi-
dence in the Government " with the despondent
remark i “ Long-looked for come at last ! Music,
please.
To the Head of the Long Film.
The long-expected come at last !
The Coalition’s day is -past,.
And, though the Gillies-Deakin firm
Has flourished for a lengthy term,
By selling friends and buying foes
On dfookerl bills, as Heaven knows, ■
E’en on the eve of Melbourne Cup
The order came to wind ’em up.
Adieu to Duncan’s nasty smile
For, please the pigs ! a little while ;
■ That grin of triumph, quite unique,
Which puckered-up his brazen cheek
And slowly softened to a sneer
Will, for the present, disappear,
And all his gas will be dispers’d
As from a toy-balloon that’s burst.
O, do you ever know remorse
For what you’ve done ? You don't , of course.
Could conscience e’er of slumber rob ,
The man who worked the Tramway job,
And fiftv more of lesser weight,
Such as the “ extra thou.” for Speight ?
No shadows of his shifty schemes
Will darken tough old Duncan’s dreams.
The long-expected come at last!
Your feast is followed by a fast;
Seek now to let the country know
It cannot trust “ that false Munro,”
Who’ll do the things you did yourself
Till Jimmy laid you on the shelf.
Rail loud against that man of sin
Except when you are “standing in.”
Be patient, Duncan ; brave, remain,
Your turn will soon come round again ;
In time you’ll get a decent show
To snatch the bag from J. Munro,
And purchase with your golden shower
Another spell of pomp and power.
Meanwhile, thank Fortune that your rest
is taken in a feathered nest.
Duncan Gillies has just finished his twelfth
year of office, the recently-collapsed Ministry being
the seventh with which he was connected. In his
early life he was an incidental disease, and every
Cabinet had him at least once, but now he seems
to have become chronic and incurable. As there
is no known remedy for him the country can only
take refuge in prayer. The only Victorian
Minister who enjoyed an equal record was J . M.
Grant, who was also progressing favourably in his
seventh Cabinet when he died. Like Gillies,
nothing short of death would ever have shifted
him R S. Anderson was in seven Governments
and "held office for 10 years altogether; he would
probably have been in 14 Governments only he
got buried somehow. Sir James M Cullooh had a
hand in six Cabinets lasting for an aggregate of
11 years, and then he collapsed like a dynamited
egg-shell, and from being the supreme boss of a
colony he fell into such absolute nothingness that
an up country municipality would have scorned to
appoint him as pound-keeper and local dog-
drowner. Berry and Kerferd belonged to six
Cabinets, and were eight years in office, and
Francis drew his salary as a statesman for nine
years and lasted through five Administrations.
An Administration was an ephemeral thing in
these days, however, and when the Opposition
called on it to “come outside” it generally went
out and failed to get back again.

Honi Soit Qui Mai Y Pense:
The Tale of a Garter.
Mr. Bertram Lamar sat on the arm of a chair in
the hall of the hotel and idly swung his foot. Mr.
Lamar was bored. An extended acquaintance
with this young man forces me to confess that he
was not often afflicted in that way. We know
that no man can aspire to be of the highest fashion
without constantly experiencing the pangs of this
distinguished, ailment, and yet Mr. Lamar was
unquestionably of the highest fashion. The most
cursory glance would tell you this. Anyone could
see that he belonged to the best people, that only
the best people would be bearable to him. It was,
therefore, with humiliation that he confessed to
himself how seldom, considering all his advan-
tages, he felt the inspiring throes of boredom.
Who can guess how hard he tried to crush his
exuberant vivacity, to quell his laughter, to extin-
guish the sparkle in his handsome brown eyes ?
He could find diversion at Tadmor in the Wilder-
ness. If you were a true devotee of fashion, his
unquenchable spirits would make your hair stand
on end.
. But now he was genuinely bored, and he felt
joyously that anyone could see he was. Ladies
passed—old ones, who swept up the dust with
trains, and who creaked as they moved, as if they
wanted oiling; young ones, in light frocks and
wide, flowered hats, which cast a shadow over the
clearest eyes. They kept banging open the glass
doors and going out into the blaze of sun beyond,
with a bursting into bloom of lace parasols,
or coming into the cool of the hall, with
the rustling, silken sheathing of the para-
sols suddenly furled, and the tapping of
their little heels on the hard floor. He never
glanced at them. But they did at him—swiftly,
obhquely-from under the hat-brim out of the
shadow. He looked away, with raised chin and
indolently drooped eyelids ; but about his heart
he began to feel a little creeping, warm titillation
of interest, a premonition that ho was not going
to keep bored very much longer. There was one
B-M-she kept going to and fro—and, as lie looked
on the ground, he could see the hem of her dress
and her feet. They were pretty feet in yellow
shoes, small and pointed. Mr. Lamar found him-
self ruminating : “ Suppose the head is as pretty
as the feet. But it never is. There’s a law of
compensation which prevents that. The head
which belongs to those feet is thirty-five” And
he looked up. The head matched the feet to perfoc-
tion. Mr. Lamar felt ta.it he did not look bored any
longer. Rather, however, than sacrifice this
dearly bought and enviable condition of being, he
turned his back on that enchanting head, and
sauntered into an adjoining room. There would be
no one to look at here to destroy the aristocratic
vacuity of his mind.
The room was empty, cool, and dim. It had
oak-chairs and tables and writing-desks, sea-green
walls, and a great window opening on the balcony.
Outside there Were old ladies sitting under a
forest of parasols. Beyond were velvety sweeps
of close-cropped turf, dappled with short shadows
shrinking to the tree-roots. Splinters of dusty
sunlight crept down the boles of the stately
cedars and trembled on the white dresses of
passing girls. There were glimpses of spiked
unfolding fan-palms and rustling melancholy
dracaenas, fat cactuses of an unhealthy morbid
hue, and little squat, flat, prickly green things
growing in irritable confusion. Mr. Lamar felt
that he might gaze upon this prospect for an
infinitude of time and remain bored.
But fate willed otherwise. As he entered the
room he saw something on the floor near the table.
He picked it up. It was a band about an inch
and a-half wide, covered with a puckered yellow
ribbon, and with one end run through a clasp of
dull silver, showing a monogram in small dia-
monds. There was a bunch of narrower yellow
ribbon beside the clasp, each end finished with a
little tongueless silver bell. It appeared to Lamar,
from some hanging filaments of thread, that the
two ends of this band had once been stitched
together. He looked curiously at his find.
“ What can it be ?” he mused, staring at it. We
have said that he was young, and came of the best
people, and with the best people there is always a
doubt as to whether they Wear such vulgar things
as stockings or possess such unmentionable things
as legs. “ Wings, not legs or feet, shall move
them,” as the pOet gracefully expresses it.
Lamar first; thought he would take it to the
office. But curiosity impelled him to study it.
It might be worn round the neck; but no; it
was not long enough. He drew the severed ends
together, and held it off from him, eyeing it
dubiously, and reflectively pulling his small
mustache. Oh, yes, of course. Now he saw.
How dense he had been ! A bracelet. Holding
it together, he pushed his hand through it, and it
swung on his wrist.
“ I don’t think I ever saw a bracelet just like
that_ before,” he thought, moving it round and
looking at it with his head on one side.
And then, as he looked at it, came a sudden
flash of wakening light, and, for a moment, he
stood staring at it in stupefied horror as it hung
over his wrist. With the return of consciousness,
he crumpled it up and crushed it into his pocket.
What should he do with it ? If he took it to the
office, its owner would never dare to claim it. If
he found out who she was, he would never dare to
offer it.
He could imagine the scene: A lovely and
youthful lady is discovered walking in the cor-
ridor. To her appears Mr, Bertram Lamar in
full evening-dress, with a white pink in his
button-hole. Making towards her, he executes
one of those majestic yet easy bows for which the
Lamar family have been famous ever since the
days of their illustrious founder. Then, drawing
a package from his pocket, Mr. Lamar presents
it to her, murmuring, “Yours, I believe,” and
vanishes through a trap-door. He might give
it to her, and then pretend to be prostrated by
the heat, and fall on the floor with his eyes shut,
to avoid embarrassing her by witnessing her in-
evitable confusion. The Lamars were also famous
for their chivalrous attitude towards the sex.
But can a man be prostrated by heat on a day
when the thermometer in its most ambitiously
soaring moments can only struggle up to seventy-
five degrees ? What should he do to spare her
feelings and his own ? And he turned the catise
of his perturbation over in his pocket.
Just then he heard a step outside —a feminine
frou-frou. With a guilty start, he retreated from
the table, fell into a chair, and seized the morning
paper, in which he buried his head. Any one
noting this fact would, of course, imagine that he
slumbered, and feel themselves safe from espial.
“ It is she,” thought Bertram, seized with guilty
tremors; “she has come to hunt for it,” and he
remained motionless.
So did she. There was not the smallest vibra-
ting rustle from her silent figure. Bertram rattled
the paper, stabbed a little hole through it with his
finger, and peeped at her. She was standing in
the doorway, peering about the room, and she
was the young lady with the yellow shoes. She
was charmingly pretty, in a light dress of striped
flannel and a loose shirt of thin silk, made like a
boy’s. Under the turned-down collar was knotted
a four-in-hand necktie of white pique, and about
her waist was a woven silk belt clasped with a
silver S. She was slowly sweeping the room with
a long glance, only her head moving, her figure
finely erect, her right thumb in her belt, and her
left hand hanging by one side and lightly clasping
a little leathern thong which was wound about
her knuckles. As to her head —that lovely head
with strong brown hair curling up crisply under
her sailor hat, delicately rounded cheeks, and
gravely pouting lips—it was an image of soft,
delicious beauty. At her side sat a little pug-dog
on its haunches, gasping and rolling its eyes.
She cast a hurried glance at the gentleman read-
ing the paper, and walked into the room, looking
intently about the floor.
“What would she say,” thought Bertram, as
she passed him in her search, “if I were to inno-
cently ask her what she’s looking for, and gallantly
offer to help her find it ? But I’ll spare her that,
even though I do appear a clown,” and the hero
peeped again.
She was certainly hunting thoroughly. She
moved several of the chairs, drew up the lace
curtains and looked under them, peered into all
the corners and under the tables and round the
desks.
“What the deuce could she have been doing ?”
thought the young man; “ she must have been
playing puss-in-the-corner or forfeits. I’ll burst
with curiosity soon and hit her with one of the
pieces ”
When she had searched everywhere she straight-
ened herself with a sigh, threw one last reluctant
look about the room, and calling to the pup,
“.Come along, dearest, it isn’t here,” departed.
Bertram laid down the paper and looked after
her. She appeared to him to have a singular
amount of sang-froid, also a very graceful back.
How well she walked ! How proudly she carried
her small dark head !
When she was out of sight, he cautiously drew
forth the yellow band and studied the monogram.
It was exceedingly complicated, and seemed to
him to consist mainly of large B’s, with small O’a
distributed about them, which puzzled Mr. Lamar.
Mr. Lamar was not bored that afternoon. He
was consumed with perplexity. How could he
return the lost treasure to its owner without caus-
ing her embarrassment, without making her his
enemy for life ? If it had been anything else, how
delightfully he could have broken the ice with it!
But to break the ice with that histrionic problem—
impossible ! It would have exactly the opposite
effect, and cause the ice to form as beneath a
breath from the Arctic.
He roamed about listlessly. It was a warn
afternoon, and outside the glass doors there was a
great blaze and glare of sun. After lunch, th®
guests dispersed. The dowagers lumbered upstairs
to appear resplendent at dinner-time, and sit
along the ball-room walls, watching three gyrating
couples try to imagine, like the ambitious little
goats who endeavoured to persuade themselves
that they were cows, that they were attending a
large and select ball of the most brilliant gaiety
and fashion. The younger married women also
withdrew, to lounge away the afternoon in golden-
moted gloom behind drawn blinds. Driving-
parties started out with laughter and gay voices,
the snapping of whips, and the grinding of gravel
under revolving wheels. Away they whirled down
the drive, streaked with already lengthening
shadows, to range along winding yellow roads
beside the many-sounding sea, where dark, writhing
cypresses crouched before the angry breezes, or
steal through noiseless, dim, dun-coloured woods,
silent and dripping with funereal mosses, the sad
ghosts of once green and whispering forests. Some
of the young ladies strolled over the lawn, away
through light and shade, parasol on shoulder,
book in hand.
Then it grew very hot and still. There was the
long roll and crash of balls from the bowling-
alley, and a gentle, occasional clicking from the
billiard-room. The clerk read a novel with his
feet on the desk; down in the barber’s shop the
barbers were all sitting in white jackets, reading
papers. In the glass-covered end of the balcony
enormous flies buzzed ceaselessly, and bees swung

in the cups of the huge drowsy-headed poppies.
The shadows stole across the velvet sward, a leaf
circled languidly downward through sun and
shade. Here was a condition of things to have
bored a newly-liberated convict, to have subdued
the high spirits of a miss fresh from the convent.
But Mr. Lamar was not bored. He even did
not care whether he looked so or not. His pride
was shattered. He sat on the balcony, and there
being no one to dispute his loneliness, he put both
his legs over the arm of his chair, clasped his
hands behind his head, and tilted his hat on to
the bridge of his nose. From under the hat-brim
rose occasional thin spirals of smoke and long
sighs.
“I must give it to her this evening,” he
thought; “ I’ll wrap it up in paper and tie one of
the ribbons round it that are on that mouchoir-
case Milly gave me. Then, if she asks me —as,
of course, she will —what it is, I’ll say, carelessly ;
‘Oh, nothing! .Just a little trifle, I think,
belongs to you. Don’t hurry to open it. Have
you noticed what a beautiful night it is ?’ And so
I’ll engage her in absorbing conversation. But if
the conversation is not sufficiently absorbing, and
she begins to open it, I must flee from the wrath
to come. And when next I meet her, dying to
speak or even bow to her, there will be a wall of
ice raised between us. She will turn her profile
toward me and become engrossed in the beauties
of the landscape.” Such is the irony of fate.”
The languorous afternoon burned itself away in
loitering stages of deepening light and colour to a
smouldering crimson sunset. Dinner loomed in the
near distance, and was awaited with fond ex-
pectancy. At 7 o’clock Mr. Lamar came slowly
down the broad stairs, looking as handsome as the
young Dionysius in his dress-suit, his shining
shirt-bosom, and a white pink in his buttonholO.
The hall was full of moving figures and a blaze of
light and colour. Gay running laughter and
broken ends of sentences detached themselves from
the hum of voices. Splendidly-dressed ladies
passed and repassed in couples, in threes, in long
lines, or stood in groups, with the gas-light break-
ing in myriad little splinters on their tumbled
trains of soft silk, and sliding with glossy
radiance along their half-bared arms. There was
a fluttering and sweeping of fans, a rustling of rich
crushed fabrics.
Outside there was still light. Through breaks
in the foliage gleamed the fiery eye of the angry
sunset. The summits of the taller trees were
touched with a lingering brightness, but in their
odorous shadows lurked the reluctant dewy dusk.
Mr. Lamar was too perturbed in mind to care to
mingle with the gay, loud-voiced, laughing crowd.
He wished for solitude, and directed his steps
towards the little writing-room. He had not
wrapped the treasure in paper, nor tied it up with
a ribbon from his mouchoir-ease. He had not
done anything with it. He did not dare. The
sight of its owner might inspire him to the des-
perate pitch of boldly offering it to her, or suggest
to him some cunning way of returning it without
betraying the identity of the finder. With these
ideas in his mind he carried it still in his pocket,
in company with his keys, jingling on the end of
a chain.
The gas in the writing-room was not lit. Red
gleams shot in from between the great boles of the
cedar-trees and touched the sea-green \valls. Mr.
Lamar liked the softening light and the pensively-
faint prospect, and went to the open window'.
Just outside it, on the balcony, in a Shaker rock
ing-chair, was the young lady who had worn the
yellow shoes. She was reading and rocking, her
pug in her lap; and if she was pretty in her
flannel morning-dress, words cannot describe
her in a mist of fine black gauze, cut
square round her neck, and showing her
arms to the elbow. Her skin was as white and
flawless as a blanched almond. There was the
gleam of a gold pin from the shadow of her dark
hair, and a jewel hung round her neck rose and
fell with her quiet breath. As she read, she
absently pulled the pug’s ears, which drowsed
with its eyes half-open and its head against her
arm.
Lamar looked. She turned the page. The pug,
disturbed, rose to its fore-paws, gazed at her with
an expression of idiotic fondness, and tried to lick
her chin. She avoided this demonstration of
affection by moving her chin from side to side,
keeping her eyes still on the book. The pug con-
tinuing, she struck it gently, observing :
“Don’t, you bad little abominable dog !”
“I beg your pardon,” said Lamar suddenly
from the window.
The lady looked up, with the raised eyebrows of
polite inquiry.
“I have something of yours,” said the young
man, desperately, and in a low tone.
“Yes? What is that?”
“I —I—don’t quite know. Or, rather —well —
but —um ! I didn’t like to leave it at the office. I
thought—yes—l thought ” He leaned out of
the window, with his closed hand extended.
“ Here it is.”
She held out her hand, and he dropped it in.
She looked, and gave an exclamation of joy that
caused the pug to jump to the ground.
“Oh, how glad I am! Thanks so much.
Thanks awfully ! I was so afraid it was lost.
Isn’t that lucky ? ” And she looked affectionately
at the returned treasure, with her head on one
side.
There was light enough to see her face dis-
tinctly. She did not exhibit a sign of embarrass-
ment, not the ghost of a blush. Lamar felt a
sudden chill of disappointment and disapproba-
tion.
“You found it in there?” she said, indicating
the writing-room, and looking up at him wi t
frank, candid eyes; “yes; that’s where it w a
lost.”
“I —I supposed so,” said Lamar, with a wan
smile.
“ I looked for it myself this morning all over,”
she continued; “ under everything; but it was
gone. ”
“Yes?” said the young man, with a fatuously
inquiring air. (“If she knew I was behind the
paper, she’d ask me why I didn’t give it to her
then and there; and what the deuce would I say ?
I couldn’t tell her that I was afraid she would be
embarrassed, for such an idea has apparently
never entered her head. I must dissemble,”
thought he.)
“ I value this very much,” she went on, turning
it over in her hand.
“ I should imagine so,”
“You see there is only one like it. There is
not a single duplicate anywhere.”
She looked smilingly in'to his face. Lamar
stared at her in stupefied horror.
“ Only one—did you say ?” he managed to
articulate in a faint voice.
“Only one,” she repeated, nodding her head ;
“it was made to order.”
There was a moment of silence. Lamar made
no comment, but continued to stare vacantly at
her. He was thinking, “It must have been an
accident. She can’t be a veteran of some war or
other. I might have known it—the law of com-
pensation again. Such a lovely face as that must
have some counter-balancing defect.”
“When you have only one—and that such a
pet,” she continued, not noticing his silence,
“you like to have everything as pretty as pos-
sible.”
“Yes, yes. Of course, of course,” ejaculated
Lamar, laughing idiotically. “If you have only
one, I expect it must be somewhat of a treasure,”
he thought. Then he added boldly, but with
the air of confiding a piece of news: “ I have
two.”
“Two?” said the young lady, with vivacious
interest; “what kind?”
Lamar looked askance at her, in alarmed silence.
Was she doubly afflicted ? She was stroking the
pug with the tips of her fingers, and there was
nothing in her placid expression to suggest mania
of any form.
“ The same as everybody else’s,” he answered,
with some hauteur; “ are the people in this part
of the country in the habit of managing with one.”
“As a rule, they have only one; it’s so much
less bother. Though, to be sure, I have a friend
who has—let me see—yes, eleven.”
“ She must be a centipede,” thought Lamar ;
“ I seem to be encountering remarkable freaks of
nature. There is a fortune waiting here for any
one who wants to start up a cheap museum.” Then
he remarked aloud, regarding her with his head
on one side, a tolerant, fond smile on his lips :
“ That must be quite an emharras de richesse,
especially when you’re walking.”
“They do get rather in the way,” admitted the
young lady; “ but most of them are very well
trained,”
“ Very clever of them, I am sure,” murmured
Lamar, leaning against the window-frame, and
feeling that he was about to swoon.
There was another short silence, during which
the girl continued to examine her restored treasure.
Presently she said, musingly : “I see the threads
are broken. She has broken them once before,
though I don’t see how she can possibly do it.”
Lamar only stared and swallowed. She held his
glance with a horrible, eerie fascination.
“You know she loves to run about so,” she
prattled on ? “ she ran away from me this morn-
ing, and when she came back it was gone. She
must have crept under the table, and not come out
until she had got it off.”
“ Who is she ?” asked Lamar, in a voice from the
tombs.
“She? Why, Bobo —my pug. Isn’t she a
beauty ? Come up here, Bobo ” —patting her
knee—“l want to put your collar on and show
this gentleman, who was kind enough to return
it, how pretty you look when you’re all dressed
up.” She held the band round the dog’s neck,
and, turning to Lamar, said, with laughing arch-
ness, “Isn’t it becoming?”
Lamar sat down on the window-sill. He was
not bored, but he took up the morning paper
which lay on an adjacent desk and began to fan
himself with it, though the evening had grown
cool.— Geraldine Bonner, in Habpeb.
The Psalm of Labour.
[For The Bulletin.]
Shall we toil in life-long sorrow,
Plod like bullocks in the plough,
Wear the galling yoke to-morrow
That our necks are wearing now ?
Shall the heel tyrannic grind us
In the dust as oft of yore ;
Each successive morrow find us
E’en more slavish than before?
Shall the white-hands, bleached our blood in.
Reap the harvest of our toil;
Ope the gate to let War’s flood in
On our virgin peaceful soil ?
Whose are these that rise to slay us—
Sabres drawn and Gatling guns ?
Knaves elected to betray us,
Traitors all, and Judas’ sons.
Lo, the bloody rites of Mammon
Nought but human lives appease:
Build the altar, lay the lamb on,
Rob the hive and slay the bees !
O, ye prophets of the dayspring,
And the promise from on high !
What can rulers such as they bring
To the weary souls that sigh ?
To God’s earth a famished larder ?
No ; His table's spread for all;
Though those sons whose lives are harder
Gather only crumbs that fall.
Austral sons of British sires—
Cast in freer moulds than they—
Rise and catch Promethean fire,
More of Christ and less of clay.
Hark ! a million voices call you,
Burst the bonds that hold you down,
Break the fetters that enthral you,
Grasp your sceptre and your crown !
Not through bloody revolution
Lies the royal road to Right:
But through patient evolution,
Saying “Let there first be Light.”
Show the worth of bone and sinew
And a strong arterial flow —
Fan the burning thought within you,
Dare to act, and dare to know.
Down with old-world race-dissensions,
Truth and justice lead the van ;
Creed and Caste are hell’s inventions s
Trust the brotherhood of man.
Down with cut-throat competition,
And the sturdy beggar’s call;
Down inordinate ambition —
All for each, and each for all.
Cling to truth though friends desert you,
And yon band lik.e Gideon’s grows
Weaker on the side of virtue,
Till you woo and win your foes.
Trust yourselves in hope of others,
Weaker vessels though they be ;
In the Ballot’s battle, brothers,
Stand united and be free.

Australian Actors’ Grievances: “An Old
Hand” Discourses Thereon.
Dear Bulletin, —The question asked by yoa in
a recent issue, “Why do not actors strike?” is
one that merits more serious consideration than ifc
has hitherto received. As The Bulletin is
always on the side of justice as opposed to mere
power, a few facts as to the actual treatment of
the profession in Australia—facts, as a rule, totally
unknown to the outside public—may not be amiss.
It may be premised that although there would
be probably nothing more difficult to organise
than an actors’ union (without which any strike is
impossible), yet, that once formed, no union would
probably be able to exercise so much power. All
the conditions of complete success lie dormant in
the idea. But who will bell the cat ?
Actors, which term must be held to include
both sexes, and to apply for the purpose of this
letter only to those fulfilling a salaried engage-
ment under agreement, excluding the pseudo-stars
who, by virtue of the possession of plays of more
or less doubtful merit, wander to and fro to the
infinite detriment of dramatic art, may be divided
into two classes: those who are playing under
agreements signed abroad and those who are
playing under “ colonially-signed ” agreements.
There is very little difference between the two,
with the exception that the latter are signed more
or less under the compulsion of necessity with a
bitterly-acquired experience of all that they in-
volve ; while the former are mostly signed in
entire ignorance of the real circumstances of the
case. But, wherever signed, the tenor of the agree-
ment is the same, and they are purely one-sided
affairs ; the manager can violate the spirit or even
the letter with impunity, while the artist can as a
rule only suffer in silence.
Manager A goes to London for the purpose of
engaging fresh talent, or, perhaps, requests his
agent to do it for him. To an artiste, wearied
and, perhaps, ill with continual work, the
prospect of a long sea-voyage, with an engagement
at the end of it, is an attractive bait. The agree-
ment is always for twelve months, with the option
of renewal for another twelve months on the part
of the management only. Manager A, or his agent,
is all suavity, the salary offered is higher, too,
than the artiste is at present receiving— not very
much higher (in the ratio of £7 to £5 usually), but
still higher—and everyone knows that Australia is
a cheap place to live in. A printed form of agree-
ment is produced which provides inter alia that for
four weeks in the year should the artiste not be
performing no salary shall be paid. The actor, .
perhaps, objects that the agreement is ha dly
explicit enough, that it is entirely in favour of the
manager, and that, for instance, no provision is
made lor playing in his or her special line of busi-
ness. Manager A, or his agent, still all suavity,
points out that for various unexplained reasons
they are obliged to adhere to their printed forms,
that no difficulty can possibly occur, and that
every consideration will be shown to the wishes of
so well-known an artiste, &c., &c., and finally the
agreement is signed.
Arrived in Australia, the main points which the
actor discovers are, that from Manager A. all
suavity has disappeared, and that he is now pos-
sessed of just about as much oonside ation for
his employe as the boss director of a dock com-
pany displays to a lumper, that although the
salary paid is slightly higher than that paid in
England (in the provinces), yet, that the actual cost
of living is more than twice as much, that there
are no long runs, and in consequence continual re-
hearsals, and, more than that, there are continual
heavy expenses for dressing continual new parts
(the Australian public being very exacting in this
respect); further, the actors find themselves cast for
business for which they were never engaged, put
into pantomime or burlesque at the whim of the
management, or “lent” to support music-hall
stars or Irish comedians; further still, the month
without salary which the management stipulate
for is nearly always taken at the very commence-
ment of the engagement, so that unless an actor
starts with funds m hand, which is often not the
case, he must commence by getting into debt in a
strange country. Weighted with all these disad-
vantages the end of the year often sees the artiste
without sufficient funds to return home, and then
there is only one result, a result calculated on and
often deliberately brought about—he takes up a
permanent residence at Poverty Point, and be-
comes the slave of a “ring ” of colonial managers.
For “ring” it is in the fullest sense of the
word. Our actors are miserably paid and more
than overworked, and yet have no remedy,
for to quarrel with one manager would
generally be to quarrel with practically all and
deprive themselves of the means of earning a
livelihood. It is a well-known fact that one Aus-
tralian manager, should an artist for any just
reason refuse to fulfil his engagement, has the
incredible meanness to indite at once a letter to
his brother managers asking them never to employ
the said artiste again, a request that, on the
part of several of the fraternity, is more often
than not complied with. They have always taken
care that the supply shall exceed the demand, and
a sufficient number of artistes are always kept
walking about to supply the place of any recalci-
trant member of a company.
The question of overwork admits of no dispute.
Owing to the short runs usually obtained by pieces
out here the hours may be put down as follows :
Rehearsal, 10 till 4; dressing and acting, 7 till
11.30; in addition to this, somewhat more than ten
hours of the day, a considerable amount of time
must be given to the study of continual fresh
parts. But this is not all. On the eve of a new
production actors are frequently required to re-
hearse all day, act at night, then, after the per-
formance, to rehearse till four or five in the
morning, rehearse again from ten till four, and
then appear in the new production at night,
when, if there is, as might be expected, a want of
life discernible in the performance, the manager
is most likely in a furious temper because they do
not “ play up.” And in nearly every case this
continual strain is the outcome not of any actual
necessity, but of bad and ignorant stage manage-
ment. And what are the wages for this laborious
work? A little higher than obtain in the English
provinces, where living is cheap, and where the
hours of actual work instead of being from ten to
fourteen per day are seldom, owing to the long
runs, more than four or five. Excluding operatic
artistes, those who are, at the present time, re-
ceiving more than ten pounds per week can be
very easily counted, while for the rank and file of
the profession, five pounds would probably be too
high an average. In case of illness, even when
caused by overwork or the insanitary state of
the theatre even their paltry allowance is at
once stopped, thus throwing the actor more and
more in the power of the manager.
Were it not for the lavish, often too lavish, ap-
plause with which an Australian audience always
greets those who work for their amusement, there
would be little compensation in the life of a
salaried actor out here. Overworked and under-
paid they have likewise to endure much in their
life behind the scenes, for, with one exception,
there is not a theatre in Australia which provides
dressing-rooms for all the artistes of ordinary
comfort and decency.
The fact that one well-known manager is in
the habit of facetiously alluding to the
members of his company as his “slaves,” is
a fair example of the consideration shown
to the ordinary artiste, and a little anecdote
which also has the advantage of being true
will still further illustrate this. A fairly well-
known actor, temporarily out of harness, called at
the stage-door of a certain Australian theatre for
the purpose of soliciting an engagement. He was
met by Cerberus. “ What do you want?” “To
see Mr. A. or Mr. B.” “What’s yer name?”
“Smith.” “A hactor?” “Yes.’ “Want an
engagement?” “Yes.” “ Come along ’ere,” and
leading the way to the office he introduced the
visitor with the remark, “Smith; ’ere's Mr. A.
and ’ere’s Mr. 8., be’ave yerself.” He had taken
the cue from his masters. And yet most of these
men have in a few years, mainly by the exertions
of their paid artistes, risen from nothing.
With real and solid grievances to redress is an
actors’ union impossible ? It would almost seem
so. Of advantage only to the salaried artiste,
none of these dare take any part in its inception,
for to do so would mean forfeiting any prospect of
obtaining an engagement in the Australia. The
only chance would be for some one outside the
profession, and careless of managerial wrath, to
take the initiatory steps, for, once formed, the
advantages would be too patent for it not to be
eagerly taken advantage of by the profession
generally, and no manager would be strong enough
to resist its influence. Blackleg labour would be
out of the question here. The crying needs of
the professi n are : A fairer rate of pay; the
revision of the present one-sided form of agree-
ment and the abolition of that pernicious c'ause
which gives a man a er a lien on an actor’s services
for one month in the, year without salary ; the
abolition of needlessly long and unnecessary
night rehearsals, nearly always the result of incom-
petent stage management; the establishment of
a benevolent fund or cases of sickness and real
distress (the present theatrical fund, being entirely
under the control of the managers, is of little use
to the profession generally); and, finally, the
compulsory erection of decent and suitable
dressing-rooms in all theatres.
And all these tilings are well within actors’grasp
provided the necessary union could be brought
about. Some artistes who read this may, perhaps,
be induced to consider whether the idea is impos-
sible, after all; but few will be found to dispute
the substantial accuracy of all the assertions
herein contained.* —Yours,
AN OLD HAND.
The Socialist in London.
Ah me ! how hot and weary here in town
The days crawl by !
How otherwise they go my heart records,
Where the marsh meadows lie
And white sheep crop the grass, and seagulls sail
Between the lovely earth and lovely sky.
Here the sun grins along the dusty street
Beneath pale skies:
Hark ! spiritless, sad tramp of toiling feet,
Hoarse hawkers’ curses, cries—
Through these I hear the song that the sea sings
To the far meadowlands of Paradise.
0, golden-lichened church and red-roofed barn—
O, long sweet days—
O, changing unchanged skies, strait dykes all gay
With sedge and water-mace—
O .fair marsh land desirable and dear—
How far from you lie my life’s weary ways !
Yet in my darkest night there shines a star
More fair than day ;
There is a flower that blossoms sweet and white
In the sad city.
That flower blooms not where the wide marshes gleam ;
That star shines only when the world is grey.
For here fair peace and passionate pleasure wave
Before the light
Of radiant dreams that make our lives worth life,
And turn to noon our night;
We fight for freedom and the souls of men—
Here, and not there, is fought and won our fight!
E. NESBITT.
Professor Sellar, whose death was cabled
the other day, was one of the two surviving sons
of Se’lar, the factor of the Sutherland estates, who
was the main instrument of the iniquitous High-
land Clearances of two generations ago, when
hundreds of families were evicted from their
ancestral holdings (held on clan tenures from the
remotest times) —one of the vilest acts of oppres-
sion ever exercised by even British landlords. The
other son, and now sole survivor, is Robert Sellar,
of Melbourne, Sir James M‘Culloch’s partner, and
one of Victoria’s wealthiest, as he is one of her
most miassu i ing, men. Mr. Robert Sellar is
credited with manifesting an ample and unpre-
tentious generosity, which is said by those who
know him best to be directed towards numer-
ous persons who persist in regarding his
beneficence as suggested by a desire to
atone for some of his progenitor’s doings.
In Campei;dovvn (Vic.) district, there are still
living several patriarchs who have the vividest
recollection of the Sutherland horrors, and by a
curious coincidence, Professor Sellar held for some
time interests and squatting property in the same
district. One of the professor’s sons, a youth of
great scholastic promise, died at St, Kilda, Mel-
bourne, a few years ago, from consumption, and a
sad sequel to the event was the death, a year or
two later, of Rev. Adam Moffatt, his tutor, and a
favourite pupil of the late Professor’s. Young
Moffatt, who was pronounced by Bishop Moor-
house “a spiritual presence in the flesh,” died
from the same disease and was buried in the same
grave.
Old Judge Molesworfch was always clear,
headed. In criminal cases he kept a watchful ev
on the interests of the accused, whether defended
or not. He never bullied juries, and yet had
way of showing where they were wrong. ,q Q *
years ago he tried a Pitzroy volunteer who had
deliberately raised his rifle and shot his wife dead
There was no excuse. Molesworth charged hor
for murder or nothing. The jury found in.,®
slaughter. The Judge, blinking at the prisoner
in that queer way he had, said ; “ Prisoner at tii
bar, the'jury have found you guilty of man 6
slaughter. As their belief must have been th if
you raised the gun to your shoulder by accident
put your finger on the trigger and took deliberate
aim by accident, and fired the weapon entirely bv
accident, I sentence you to 24 hours’ imprison-
ment.” The most astonished man in the crowd
was the said volunteer. u
From a Northern paper :—
Mrs. Conroy, the sufferer by the East Darr tiwedv nf
three years ago, is now hopelessly blind. Mr. Coimw
was on East Darr Station, and during his temporarv
absence his wife, for company, went to stay the nightat
the house of a married couple named Suttor. About n
o’clock she awoke with a pain in her arm as from a bite
but it was not at first very severe. The stillness of her
I2-months’-old baby girl attracted her attention and tn
her horror, on examining the infant, she found it
just dying. The eyes were open and staring, and the
mouth also, but they closed just as death took place and
then the child looked as if in a deep sleep Five horn
afterwards the body turned quite black. There being no
medical man within a great distance, the cause of death
remained a mystery until, six nights afterwards, a three
year-old child of the married couple in whose home Mrs
Conroy’s infant died, was found dead at the same hour of
night, and in the same bed. Mr. Conroy and his wife
were summoned, and the bereaved parents stood aghas
at the second mysterious death under exactly similar cir- i
cumstances. Their uncertainty was, however, soon dis-
pelled, for Mr. Conroy, happening to turn down the
coverlet of the bed, found and killed a snake 17in. long,
light brown in colour with a black head marked with
minute white spots. The body of the dead child was
examined, and on one of the hands were found four little
punctures thus forming a square about three-
eighths of an inch. 'In five hours the body of
Suttor’s child turned clack, conclusively proving that
both the victims had met with the same end. Mrs.
Conroy’s arm was much swollen for several days after the
night she slept at Suttor’s house, and she suffered great
pain, but gradually the swelling diminished, and the arm
recovered its normal health. Four little marks exactly
similar to those seen on the hand of Suttor’s child were
found on Mrs. Conroy’s arm, and still remain there.
Within a month after the death of her child Mrs. Conroy’s
\\sion became partially obscured, and very soon she
became quite blind. For over two years her case was
under the care of doctors out West, Mr. Conroy’s means
not al\wing him to send her south. Four months ago,
however, the shearers and rouseabouts on Lerida,
Katandra, and Rockwood subscribed £130 towards the ex-
penses of a trip to Sydney to consult the specialists there,
but their kindness has only served to demonstrate the
hopelessness of her case. It is thought the snake—the
nights being cold—crept into the tent and thence to the
bed for warmth ; that it was disturbed, bit the child first,
and then the mother, and that, having expended its
venom in the child, it had not the same deadly poweratits
second effort. The four punctures, Mr. Conroy.says, con-
clusively prove that (as lately proved by Mr. Bray, of
Sydney) the assertion of naturalists, that snakes having
more than two fangs are not poisonous, is incorrect. Mrs.
Conroy is only 26 years of age, and of robust physique
The doctors attribute her blindness to nervous shock.
