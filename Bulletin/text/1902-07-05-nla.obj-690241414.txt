THE RED PAGE.
Nietzsche.
REYNOLDS’S NEWSPAPER, in announc-
ing a cheap translation of one of Nietz-
sche’s books, says
Nietzsche is the most daring of individualists, yet with
the tenderest of hearts. Originality marks every line of
his writings. One may not agj-ee with half of what he
says, but his utterances are so profound and so striking
that they force thought. For mental stimulus, this is
the man in a worn-out and Mammon-worshipping a«e.
... Undoubtedly the most refreshing breeze of philo-
sophical thought that has blown across Europe in the
last half-century has come from the great German
thinker, I riedrich Nietzsche, the first part of whose great
prose epic, “Thus Spake Zarathustra,” translated by
Thomas Common, has just appeared as a Is. 6d. volume.
An eighteen-penny edition (in a translated form)
of a great philosophical and abstract work is
indeed, fame! James Thomson, when he found
in the ingle of a remote hostelry a well-thumbed
and dogs’-eared copy of his “Seasons,” was filled
with glee. “And yet the scamps say lam not
famous, ’ he shouted, and ordered free punch for
whomsoever liked to ask for it. When Nietzsche’s
death was announced he was written about very
much as if lie had been a Herr Most, shaggy, un-
washed, filthy, half-drowned in beer, half-suffo-
cated with the fumes of bad tobacco, writing
treatises on dynamite and the destruction of
society. As a matter of fact, Nietzsche was the
most fastidious and dainty of the enemies of
conventional civilisation. Condemning the German
intellect (as did Heme before him) for indulgence,
he said : “There is too much beer in the German
intellect. Nowhere else has there been so vicious
a misuse of the two great European narcotics—
Alcohol and Christianity.”
Nietzsche was a transplanted Pole. Two other
St Germans owed little to the “ Fatherland
ipenhauer was a Dutchman ; Heine was a
Jew. The philosopher of aristocratic individualism
was born in a small Saxon village near Lutzen in
1844. But he was descended from a noble Polish
family named Nietzky, and was proud of his
Sclav origin. One admirer has found points of
resemblance between his weird prose-poem,
Zarathustra*” and Chopin’s B-minor Scherzo.
He was certainly the least Germanic of all
German writers.. His style, in its brevity, verve ,
and directness is rather Gallic than German.
This protagonist of Christianity was, strangely
enough, descended from a long line of Christian
pastors who gave up their countrv rather than
abjure their faith. On both sides the stock of his
family was vigor us, both mentally and physi-
cally. His aunt had a fine saying, which showed
the moral robustness of the race, “We
Nietzsches hate lies.”
To Nietzsche, Greece and France were the
ancient and modern examples of intellectual
supremacy. Six French writers he named whom
he considered to be nearer to Greek antiquity than
any other group of modem authors, having minds
which contained more real thought than all the
books of all the German philosophers put together.
These six were Montaigne, La Rochefoucauld, La
Bruyhre, Fontenelle (“Dialogues of the Dead”),
Chamfort, and Vauvenarges. Stendhal was the
single French writer of the present century (with
the exception of Merimee) whom he considered to
possess some of the characteristics of the earlier
group. For ancient Greece the iconoclast had abso-
lute admiration, albeit he expelled some Hellenic
prophets from his temple. In 1871 he published
his first work, a treatise on the origin of music
and the drama, in which he embodied his famous
doctrine of the “ dithyrambic theory of life.”
Here he looked into primitive human nature as he
found it in early Greece, and discovered two
impulses or inspirations which led to art-produc-
tion : in other words, which led mortals out of
the routine task of satisfying merely their physical
needs, into the upper region of spiritual and
.aesthetic movement. The first inspiration is
through dreams ; for the dreamer is straightway
lifted above the beaten, sordid track of daily life.
This, in Nietzschean phrase, is the Apollonian
impulse. The other impulse comes from the
gladness that men feel when they are in touch
with the overflowing and intoxicating power of
Nature. This he called the Dionysiac impulse,
coining his word from Dionysos, the god who
presides oyer the springing corn, the opening bud,
the breaking blossom, and all the mysteries of
Nature. Along such lines as these Nietzsche
works out the doctrine cl. “ the will to live ” into a
doctrine of “ the will to enjoy life.” His starting-
point is essentially Hellenic:
Live in the Whole and the Full. Let us imagine a
generation growing up with this fearlessness of glance,
with this heroic bent towards the terrible, let us imagine
the bold step of these dragon-slayers, and the proud daring
with which they turn their backs upon all the old
optimism, and its doctrines bred of feebleness, in order to
live resolutely in the Whole and the Full.
I will learn always more and more to look upon the
necessary as the beautiful; so shall Ibe one of those who
make things beautiful.
Die proudly when it is no more possible to live proudly.
Nietzsche preached with Heine the Greek
doctrine of “ the rehabilitation of the flesh ” :
Christianity is mainly responsible for the deterioration
of t.he European rare.
To attack the passions at the root means to attack life
itself at the root.
Chastity and sensuality are not necessarily antithetical:
every true marriage is beyond such antithesis.
The spiritualisation of sensuousness is called love : it is
a grand triumph over Christianity.
The world has been Orientalised long enough, and men
now seek to be Ilellenised.
Most of what we know personally of the last of
German philosophers is gleaned from the books
published by his sister, in which his life is brought
down to 1889, the year in which the brain of
Neitzsche was paralysed at Turin. When her
husband, Dr. Forster, died, she devoted herself to
the care and the fame of “one of the greatest
spiritual forces which have appeared since
Gcethe.”
As a student, Nietzsche wrote during bis
gymnasium days :
The study of the Grecian and the Latin languages
should be put in the front rank, and thoir point of view
compared with that of the Germans. History should not
be separated from geography, nor mathematics from
physics and music. Only by this method will the tree erf
knowledge bear excellent fruit.
At the age of fourteen (in 1858) Nietzsche
was sent to the militarily conducted school of
Pforta. His progress was astoundingly rapid,
Earticularly in philology. Before he had taken
is doctor’s degree, and in his twenty-fifth year of
age, he was offered and accepted the philological
chair at Basle. About a year before lie took up
his professorship he met Wagner in Leipzig, and
absolutely succumbed to the great musician’s
magic influence. It is curious to reflect that to
IS letzsche, Schopenhauer and Tolstoi, three great
philosophical forces, Wagner was’ a factor in
development. In 1871 he published his first work,
wtt l - 6 der Tragodie,” etc., dedicated to
‘His Sublime Fore-runner, Wagner.” He after-
wards changed his views and spoke of Wagner as
the Cagliostro of Music, the Prince of Decadents,
and said that to listen to “His Sublime Fore-
runner” one needed Pastilles Gerauclels , followed
by twenty performances of “ Carmen” as an anti-
dote.
The boyish professor, the preacher in the
abstract of sensuousness, was very shy. Women
held no attraction for him. Even while showing
sympathy towards those with whom the course of
ran by no means smoothly, he would
shake his head perplexedly and murmur :
And all that over a little girl !
He makes Zarathustra say :
• I? better to fall into the hands of a murderer than
into the dreams of an ardent woman.
Between 1873-6 he wrote four essays : “David
Strauss, ’ “ The Use and Abuse of History in Re-
lation to Life,” “ Schopenhauer as an Educator,”
and ‘ Richard Wagner.” Bizet was not then en-
throned on Nietzsche’s music-stool, and “Car-
men ’ was not yet a cure for the Teuton cycle,
lhe spell of Wagner still worked, albeit he had
written that foremost among Wagner’s partizans
we T e audiences who were bored by the old masters,
and who found in the new master a stimulant for
their faded nerves.
One day Nietzsche almost unconsciously earned
home a volume by Schopenhauer. His sister said
of it that—
Schopenhauer was not for him a book but a friend.
Schopenhauer set the Nietzschean wheels re-
yolvmg. The evolution oi Attic tragedy, with
its Apollonian and Dionysiao impulses, was the
first-fruits. In time the younger man shook off
i'i , ln^uence °f the elder, and called Schopenhauer
‘ the old pessimistic false-coiner—merely an
heir to the Christian interpretation of life.” Like
Mephistopheles, Nietzsche considers “Morality
itself as a problem ” :
. The individual in his antecedents and his consequents
is a piece of fate : To say to him, “Alter thyself,” is to
require everything to alter itself.
Men must become both better and wickeder.
Only the simpleton says, “ Men ought to be like this or
like that”
Do what you will, but first be one of those who sn able
to will.
Love vour neighbor as yourself—but first be one of
those who are able to love themselves.
He called Paul the inventor of Christianity, and
described him as a neurotic, sensual, refined
“Jewish Pascal.” Historical Christianity was
purely Pauline:—
Paul the incarnated genius inspired Chandala-hatred
against Rome, against the world—the Jew, the eternal
Jew par excellence.
The Anarchist and the Christian both wish to revenge
themselves on Life. Their motto is, “J am worth
nothing.” The Decadent says, “ Life is worth nothing.”
In the whole New Testament there is only one figure
we can genuinely honour—that of Pilate.
With its contempt for the body Christianity was the
greatest misfortune that ever befel Humanity.
A being capable of purely altruistic actions alone is
more fabulous than the Phoenix. Never has a man done
anything solely for others, and without a personal
motive ; how could the Ego act without Ego ?
In order to subsist, the highest morality must posi-
tively enforce the existence of immorality.
Nietzsche compares the last cry of the Redeemer
with the disillusionment of the dying Don
Quixote; but for Him he had no sneer. He
called Him sublime, morbid, child-like. And
again:—
Strictly speaking, there has been only one Christian,
and He died on the cross. The Gospel died on the cross.
Opposition to Christianity and its theory of self-
denial and asceticism represents the final balance
of Nietzsche’s mind. His four cardinal virtues
were sincerity, courage, generosity and courtesy.
Humility and self-sacrifice he regarded as ab-
horrent. His aphorisms on life *
Profound suffering makes noble ; it separates.
For folly’s sake wisdom is ming ed with all things.
At bottom every man well knows he can only live one
single life in the world, and that never again will so
strange a chance shake together into unitv such singu-
larly varied elements as he holds : he knows that, but he
hides it like a bad conscience.
In 1880 Nietzsche’s health broke down, and ho
resigned his chair at Basle, and was liberally
pensioned. From 1877 to 1882 may be regarded
as the period of his maturity, when he produced
his best work. His third period began in 1882,
when he produced “Thus Spake Zarathustra.”
and other books. The work of his life ended in
1889, at Turin, when his brain became irretriev-
ably paralysed.
The great idea of the Zarathustra book was the
theory of master-morality versus slave-morality.
The motto of the volume was “ Break in pieces—
break in pieces the old tables.” Nietzsche stood
forth absolutely now as the apostle of aristocracy,
individualism, loneliness, and warfare. He was,
indeed, the modern incarnation of that image of
intellectual pride which Marlowe created in
Faustus:
Then are only three respects in which the masses
appear to me to deserve a glance—first, as blurred copies
of great men, executed on bad paper and from worn-out
plates ; secondly, as opposition to the great; and, lastly,
as instruments of the great; for the rest, let them go to
the devil and to statistics.
A people is the circuit which Nature makes to arrive at
six or seven great men.
Morality is the mob-instinct working in the individual.
To be customary is to be novel.
To be individual is to be wicked.
Every kind of originality involves a bad conscience.
The artist, the actor, the merchant, the freethinker, the
discoverer, were once all criminals.
The shadow that Fate had for Nietzsohe was
the shadow that fell on Scott and on Swift ; on
Rousseau and on Pascal, and Southey. The brain
before its fall had done a work of stupendous
nature. Havelock Ellis says of Nietzsche :
A man, who has certainly stood at the finest summit of
modern culture, who has thence made the most deter-
mined effort ever made to destroy modern morals, and
who led a life as near to death as any life outside the
grave can be, must needs be a tragic figure.
Nietzsche’s pioture has been drawn by M. Sohupfi
(during the Bayreuth festival) in the following
words:—
I was struck both by the superiority of bis intellect
and the strangeness of his face. A broad forehead, short
hair brushed back, the prominent cheek-bones of th*
Sclav. The heavy moustache and the bold outline of tba
face would have given him the aspect of a cavalry officer
if it had not been for his timid and haughty air. The
musical voice and slow speech indicated the artist’s
organisation, while the circumspect meditative carriage
was that of a philosopher. Nothing more deceptive than
the apparent calm of his expression. The fixed eye re-
vealed the painful travail of thought. It was at once the
eye of an acute observer and a fanatical visionary. • The
double character of this gaze produced a disquieted and
disquieting impression, all,the more so since it seemed to
be always fixed on a single point. In moments of effusion
this gaze was softened to a dream-like sweetness, but
soon became hostile again.

Melbourne Pastor Rentoul, at a Trades Hall
Pleasant Sunday Afternoon, the other day, re-
called to the workers’ memory a neglected genius,
William Langland, a great English democrat,
whose lengthy poem of “ Piers Plowman ” was a
protest against war and war taxation, under
Edward 111. and Richard 11.
Some correspondents:—
A.P.: He “F.M.’s” article on Blake and Whitman,
no genius is absolutely original, and it would be interest-
ing to know how much Blake learned from the Christian
mystics—Behmen, Paracelsus, Swedenborg. The latter
died in London in 1772, and it is probable that Blake saw
him. Blake’s love of animals and birds might have come
from Francis of Assisi. And was he not largely indebted to
the Elizabethan poets, notably to Spenser and the “ Epi-
thalamion”? Blake’s statement, “I assert for myself
that I do not behold the outward creation,” is
the Buddhist doctrine of the illusion of the objec-
tive universe. Yet, if we agree with Emerson’s
definition of originality—“lt is being, being one’s
self, and reporting accurately what we see, and are ”
then Blake was original. Emerson relates that Words-
worth said Blake’s abnormal genius interested him more
than the conversation of Scott or of Byron. Nietzsche,
in “ Also sprach Zarathustra,” evidently borrowed largely
from Blake, but he had not Blake’s sane physiological
basis, so landed himself in a lunatic-asylum. J. A.
Symonds’ book on Whitman is the most interesting
analysis of the “ good, grey poet.” It is, surely, a mis-
take to say that Whitman “fought" in the American
war. Edward Carpenter is a mild English Whitman.
But there is no adequate poet of the Anglo-Saxon race
to-day.
[Whitman went through the American Civil War, not as
a soldier, but as a nurse.]
Wilgar: You are unreasonable in condemning the
prize-poem. The bad poetry might scrape like a hatpin
on a slate, but if the £5O would fix up a bard’s finances,
and do only moderate injury to Art, wherefore the pro-
test of the aesthetic ? Sydney University can afford the
money, and, seeing that verse-writers are thick enough
locally to compete with zest and industry, surely they
deserve all the surplus encouragement possible ?
P. Pollard (New York) : Yes, it’s a great deal too close
to be pleasant, but Whitney at this end swears that he
never saw Burgess’ poem; and we’ve got to take hie
word.
C. Crisp : Publish next week.
Old l>r. Johnson was prophetically right in
locating his wise prince in Abyssinia. King
Memlik oi that country, having given orders to
some intruding German missionaries to move
away and not disturb the faith of the people, they
protested. Then Menelik asked them if they had
no sinners in Germany. They had to say “yes,”
and the Prince told them to return to Germany,
and give their countrymen the benefit of their
advice, which was not wanted in his country.
A “Push” Novel.
“ Great Push Experiment,” by Ambrose
I Pratt (from George Robertson and Co.),
JL is a book the reading of which must
suggest regrets to the critic, for it shows
unmistakably a talent for romance far above the
ordinary, and the, raw material, moreover, of a
bright and vivid style ; and yet, withal, contains
such mistakes and crudities as sadly mar it
as a work. The effect is similar to that
of a painter of distinguished natural talent
venturing on big pictures before he has
learned his technique thoroughly. Pratt might
take a place not at all humble among Aus-
tralian writers if he would learn to, or choose to,
cook his dishes before giving them to the public.
This particular novel has rather an interesting
history. Some months ago, in the sober
pages of Blackwood, Ambrose Pratt printed
as solemn truth a delightful fairy-tale about
Sydney pushes. N.S. Wales Agent-General
Henry Copeland, foolish man, stumbled into
print to deny the truth of the yarn, and Pratt’s
name was cabled for a whole week from continent
to continent Now that fairy-tale, with some
woman-interest added, and some more fictional
details, becomes an original and exciting novel—
“ The Great Push Experiment.” The main fault
is that the atmosphere of romance is at the outset
sought to be smothered by a preface solemnly
claiming truth for the main facts, and then is
rudely disturbed at intervals by the introduction
of real personages. It is as if Anthony Hope dis-
turbed the illusion of the “Prisoner of Zenda”
by dragging in now and again Lord Salisbury or
Mr. _ Chamberlain. A novel should never give
a hint to its readers to stop and ask, “la
this true ? ” Beside this mistake, others of fact, of
construction, of actual grammar, of too “luscious”
treatment of love passages are but trifling. It is,
after all, from the ordinary reader’s standpoint,
not very important that on page 1 a grand piano
is made to occupy the moiety of “a large and
stately, chamber, ’’ and that on many other pages
there is some extraordinary lapse of the sama
character; but that the fictional atmosphere
should be every now and again broken into, is a
more serious blemish. But, passing all that, the
book is a vivid and exciting one, original in its
main conception, carried out, in the Main, to a
natural and intensely exciting climax.

Persistent Mr. Priestman still pegs away
with his demand for the release of poor old Cress-
well, the nnn who probably, if not certainly, isn’t
the real, original, long-lost, and no longer desir-
able Roger Tichborne. Priestman, the other day,
took a reporter along to interview his protege at
1 ark (S. W.) Asylum, but the expedition
vas a dismal failure. The lunatic revealed nothing,
jave a vague desire to hang one of the warders.
He didn t seem to know his faithful barracker,
Priestman, what time he was accepting oranges,
•tobacco, bananas, and cigars from. the visitor.
As for Cresswell being reasonably interviewed
any more on this earth, the idea seems absurd.
He refuses to talk, even with his brother patients.
H there was any glimmer of light in the man’s
mind before his real Sir Rogerness was forced
upon his notice, the strain of wondering what it
all means must have “ dowsed his glim ” for ever.
He now expresses _ some sense of mystery by
“holding up a warning hand,” as though he sus-
pected a plot to carry him off somewhere. Under
the circumstances, Cresswell’s release would pro-
bably be a cruel farce, but cruel farces are so
common in cases of lunacy that any stern medical
objection to bis capture is unaccountable. The
N.S.W. Govt, is not so devotedly attached to its
lunatics that it can’t bear to part with old Bill
Cresswell.
“ Malle’s ” theory :
It has been proposed to fix a maximum expenditure for
Parliamentary candidates, it being held that vital
questions are often drowned in a sea of beer. Under
present conditions the heaviest item of expense is litera-
ture, tons of this heavy substance being unnecessarily
dumped everywhere. The writer once witnessed a heated
discussion in China, between tars and Chows. The one
whose arguments carried most weight, the sort of senior
wrangler, was a brawny person with about 18in. of thin
bar iron in his fist. He appeared to convince his
opponents every time, and not one of them continued the
debate. Since then I’ve been impressed with the
necessity for condensing one’s blows. It’s useless trying
to belt at man’s whole anatomy with one whack, and
election literature, to be any good, should only contain a
few crisp sentences that will hang in the memory and,
like Twain’s “ pink trip slip for a three cent, fare,” won’t
be shaken off until the elector has either voted for, or
violently assaulted the author. One boiled-down whoop
of 10 words which conveyed the alleged essence of its
side’s policy and held the other crowd up to derision
would fill the bill and win every time.
The trouble is that sometimes the name of the
creek that you are promising to get the bridge
over runs to three words itself. That leaves you
four words in which to promise the bridge and
three in which to heap an avalanche of scorn on
the adversary.

Eight Years’ Dyspepsia.
A LONG PERIOD OF SUFFERING.
A WELCOME FRIEND IN TIME OF NEED.
The Case of tyrs. S. BRQ.VN.
(by our reporter.)
If you are imbued with any desire to gain
an insight into the methods adopted by
people whose efforts are attended with suc-
cess, you cannot do better than read the
following narrative, which was related by
Mrs. Selina Brown, of No. 5 Little Edward-
street, Pyrmont.
“ One day,” said Mrs. Brown, “ as I was
talking to a young girl at the front door, a
strange and overpowering sensation came
over me, which caused me to have a fit, and
I was taken indoors and put to bed, where
I was lying unconscious for three days. A
doctor was called in, but he said that he
could not account for the sudden turn I
had taken. He prescribed some medicine,
which did not have any beneficial effect,
as three weeks later I took another fit in my
sleep, after which I was so feeble that I had
to keep to my bed for several days, and
again the doctor was brought to my bed-
side.”
“ Previous to taking the fits were you in
good health ? ” asked the reporter.
“ I was not at all well, as you may gather
from the fact that for eight years I suff red
from indigestion,” answered Mrs. Brown.
“ For a long time I seemed as if I had no
use in my body to work at all. I felt
languid and depressed in spirits, and did
not care whether I lived or died; neither
coul i I deep well. It was a perfect misery
for me to go to bed, as my mind was so un-
settled that I felt as if I wanted to walk
about all night. Just as Ith ught I was
falling asleep I commenced to think about
some troublesome subject which generally
occupied my mind till morning, and when I
got up I was too exhausted to do anything,
and with a taste in my mouth that made
everything seem bitter. The only sleep I
got was always accompanied by dreadful
dreams, so that I never got any proper rest.
The sense of hunger w r as a stranger to me
entirely, but in spite of that I took a little
food occasionally, or else I should have
starved.”
“ Hid the food do you any good ? ”
“ I am sure it did not do me much good,
if any, for I wa< continually getting weaker
and thinner, and the worst of it was that
eating always gave me such awful pains in
the stomach, where windy spasms made me
feel as if I wanted to tear my clothes off, no
matter how loose they were. A heaviness
in my chest also troubled me greatly, for as
each breath was drawn a smothering sensa-
tion came over me, and at the same time I
suffered acutely from pains under my
shoulder blades and about my back. Every-
thing possible seemed to go against me. at
once, as I was often incapacitated from
going about the house owing to my feet
swelling and my limbs aching, across the
loins especially Unless I was very careful
and slow in my movements I became so
giddy that I could not stand, while extreme
nervousness was another torture, I was
afraid to move in the dark lest something
would happen to me, and if anything gave
me the least excitement my nerves shook to
such an extent that the vibration of my
limbs was quite ' isible. Little did I think
that something even worse than these ail-
ments was in store for me, but my experi-
ence goes to show how a person’s constitu-
tion is gradually wrecked, and w'hat fright-
ful results ar > likely to follow. After my
sudden seizures I was in a more hopeless
slate than ever- My head pains were so
bad that I could not bear anybody to speak
to me, and any food that I took w r as always
vomited. The medicines and powders which
were given to me were of no avail, and at
length I crawled out of bed and went to
another doctor, who told me I ought to go
to a hospital.* Having three young children
I did not like doing so, and instead of 'going
tc a h’lßpi'al I came home ”
“ Were you wise in going against the
doctor’s advice ? ”
“It turned out to be the best thing I
could have possibly done, as a neighbour
shortly afterwards came in to see me lor the
pu pose of reading a cure performed by
Clements Tonic. When she had finished
the story she exclaimed : ‘That is just how
you are. Why don’t you try it?’ I said,
‘I believe I will.’ When my husband
came home he thought I was going
to the hospital, but I said, ‘ I’m not
g ing. Bring me home a bottle of
Clements Tonic, and I will try it. ’ On
my word of honor, I felt a slight im-
provement when I had drank only half a
bottle. Just imagine my delight after the
way I had been disappointed with all other
medicines, especially as I had long since
thought that I was doomed to die, because
I could not get relief, but Clements Tonic
soon eased the terrific pains in my head
(which extended right down my neck), and
when, in a few days, they were gone alto-
gether I could get about a little, for I also
felt more vigorous than I had been for a long
time. The first good night’s rest I had had
for many a month was obtained through the
comforting influences of Clement Tonic, and
when this grand experience had been re-
peated several nights in succession I felt
quite new, for I was happy in the belief
that I m'ght yet recover m healtli. Xverv
tissue in my bod seemed to be strong! honed
bv the wonderful med cine I was taking
and for sharpening my appetite it was just
the t 1 ing. before long 1 sat down lo m
meals like everybody else in the house, and
I could always take a fair share of whatever
was placed on the table. The neighbours
were intensely surpr sed to see me up a id
about once more, as they had entertained
little hope of ever see ng me well aga n. I
had no trouble in keeping my food down,
and every day I found greater relief from
tie symptoms of indigest on. The pans
finally left my stomach and shoulders, an 1
I could breathe without gasping as I used
to. for the oppression had disappeared from
my chest, and w th returning strength my
limbs acquired freedom from all aches.
When I was taking my doctor’s medic nes I
had no desire for any thing, but Clements
Tonic gave me a light-hearted inclination to
see everything. By its cont'nued use I
forgot what nervousness was, as I knew no
fear, and my nerves were as steady as a
rock. I was never a stout woman, yet my
diseases had dragged me down considerably,
but Cements Tonic was my sole medicine
till my lost weight was regained, and, re-
markable as it may seem, that is all I
required, for I was then quite cured of
everything. None of my former ailments
were left behind by Clements Tonic, and I
am only speaking the truth when I say that
my life was saved by that medicine. If you
like you can publish my story in any way
you deem fit, as itmay alleviate the sufferings
of many more.”

Athlete’s Cough
“I must have contracted it while
Training for Athletic Meetings ”
Winter athletics cause many colds. In
the enthusiasms of football not much care
is taken of the health. Yet even while
training and competing it is easy to guard
against coughs and colds—here is the tip *
“ Mona House, Isleworth,
“ Middlesex, England,
“ February Bth, 1901.
“Dear Sirs,—For some time I have been
suffering from a severe cold and hacking
cough, which I think I must have contracted
while training to compete at athletic meet-
ings. One day a friend of mine said I ought
to try your Scott’s Emulsion as he knew it
PERCY GOURLAY.
(From a photograph.)
would do me good. I took his advice and
soon found I was deriving benefit from the
treatment. After taking Scott’s Emulsion
for three weeks I had entirely lost my cold
and no longer had any cough. I am now
feeling in splendid health, and giva Scott’s
Emulsion all the credit for same.
“ Yours truly,
“ (Signed) Percy Gourlay.”
Every athlete knows that training makes
extra demands upon his strength—competi-
tion still greater demands. Football,
running, “ cross country” are all hard work
and must be met by extra effort. Coughs
and colds are not permissible if the athlete
is to keep in the pink of condition. Scott’s
Emulsion maintains for the athlete a per-
fect condition of health.
Mr. Gourlay got himself and kept himself
in condition by using Scott’s Emulsion.
Athletes should try it—preventive treat-
ment is better for them than curative
treatment. Scott’s Emulsion supplies
exactly what they need—pure cod-liver oil
with hypophosphites of lime and soda. The
cod-liver oil is treated by our process so that
all the virtue of it remains, while all the
disagreeable taste and smell are taken away.
Cod-liver oil is the finest strengthener
ever known: hypophosphites of lime and
soda the best tissue, muscle and bone
builders. There can be no question of the
value of these things to the athlete.
He should, however, remember that the
high value of these ingredients is obtained
only in* Scott’s Emulsion—the scientific
blending of which is the result of thirty
years’ experience. Cheap imitations give
only cheap results. No substitutes possess
the unique value of cod-liver oil.
To get the athletic value that Mr. Gourlay
obtained, take Scott’s Emulsion the
wrapper of every bottle has a picture of a
man carrying a big codfish. *
You can obtain a sample of Scott’s Emulsion
by sending fourpenceto Scott & Bowne, Ltd.,
483 Kent-street, Sydney, and mentioning this
paper. All ohemists sell Scott’s Emulsion.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A strange story of how she got a lost feel-
ing in her legs was told recently in Sydney by a
lady who was found guilty of bigamy, but only
imprisoned till the rising of the Court. She
married very young and had ten children, but had
got out of the habit of seeing her husband. The
loss of this habit lasted for about ten years.
At the end of that period she chanced to
go once or twice into the office of an
agent to see about a lease, and he asked
her to marry him. She explained about the
previous husband, who might still possibly be
alive, whereupon the agent gave her a glass of
wine, and went away to get legal advice on the
matter, leaving her locked in the office. While he
was away a lost feeling in her knees came over
her. Whether the wine or something in the wine
was the cause or not can’t be ascertained now,
but, anyhow; she was deprived of all force of
character in her legs, and when the agent came
back and said it was all right, she was led away
uncomplainingly in a cab and married. Imme-
diately after the ceremony her new husband bor-
rowed" £1 off her. Later on he borrowed £l5, and
also suggested that her property should be made
over to him. He brought Ins four children to live
with her, and afterwards he got into gaol. Then the
first husband transpired again, and there was
trouble, but the law mercifully took account of the
fact that the act of bigamy was committed in a
weak moment when the lady had no strength in
her knees, and gave her “ the rising of the Court,”
as already mentioned.
Australian Autumn in Drought Time.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Desolate, bleak and depressing, O Autumn, is thy
gradual waning,
But blue are thy skies with a keenness no glittering
steel could surpass;
Oh ! for the murmur of water, in lieu of thine
arid disdaining,
That this dusty, bleached, thirst-cracking land-
scape might be swathed in the greening of
grass.
When matched with this pitiless picture of lank
sheep and skeleton cattle,
Gasping with gouged bleeding sockets amid beak-
plunging, ravenous crows,
The deep-billow-roaring of cannon and the scenic
distractions of battle
Are something devout and inspiring, especially to
one that has foes.
Rivers are shrinking to frog-holes and choking
with carrion, green-livid;
Deserts like granite invade the once meadow-
smooth stretches of plain;
And yet we cannot but marvel at colors so various
and vivid—
But oh ! for its long swinging columns fraying
off into sombres of rain !
N.S.W.
ARTHUR A.D. BAYLDON.
Where Dreadful Drought is King!
In helpless woe the land is gaping wide,
Its river courses glisten lone and sere,
White bones betoken where its flocks have died,
Its wild mirages mock you far and near ;
The sky’s a brazen vault, so deadly clear;
The breezes sweep you by and scorch and sting :
It gleams and glares, a place of torrid fear :
This is the Land where Dreadful Drought is King !
.Across its baking plains ye may not ride,
For deadly Thirst and Desolation sheer
Encompass, as ye go, on every side,
And gibb’ring phantoms in the hazes leer;
At night the twinkling starlights peep and peer
(Just as they peer where laughing phantoms sing)
And tell a tale of dew-wet meadows dear,
Afar from lands where Dreadful Drought is King 1
For He hath won the Desert as a bride,
To Him alone she lendeth eye and ear,
For Him her shrunken veins are slowly dried,
To Him alone she bares her bosom drear;
Her ruthless Lord denies a trembling tear
To cool the parched bird on drooping wing,
Her sons knownaught of runnel sweetand mere—
This is the Land where Dreadful Drought is King !
In vain—in vain ! No gentle voice of eheer !
No clouds above where hope may climb and cling—
The breath of Death in all the atmosphere;—
This is the Land where Dreadful Drought is King I
Q.
P.L.
The Bush.
Oh, lonely sadness of the drear grey bush 1
So still, so void of every living thing !
Oh, sleeping tent-hills ! deathlike is the hush —
No voice to ripple and no bird to sing.
Dawn’s rosy red, nor evening’s gentle close,
Can tinge thy solemn wastes, thy soulless calm;
Thy irresponsive dumbness, dead repose,
May kindle to no note of Life’s glad psalm.
The winds but voice the mulga’s nightwatch dirge,
Gay noon but lights thy long unending sleep
—From Time’s first beat till endless hours shall
merge
To the last echoing deep’s reply to deep.
Pitying stars shine o’er thy ghost-grey plains !
The dingo wails his dismal weird lament—
The sense of tragic melancholy strains
Ere yet the eerie hopeless glooms are spent.
Oh, sombre Bush ! Upon my heart there groweth
Changeless and voiceless thy eternal moan :
Profound mysterious life of death in death !
Silent and endless, tortured and alone !
And yet I love thee-—infinitely vast!
My spirit revels in thy freedom wild,
The empty world drops from me, till at last,
I may be for a season Nature’s Child.

The Exodus.
Emigration from Australia is becoming an
established institution nowadays. Both in
New South Wales and Victoria the applica-
tions for permits to go to South Africa are
pouring in by hundreds, and as only persons
with at least tjlOO each in cash, over and
above their passage-money, are eligible, and
the emigrants mostly possess just about that
sum, this is mainly an exodus of the better-
off among the working classes, and of that
section of the people which used to go on
the land, in the days when the land hadn't
been so completely found out as it is now.
It is a curious thing that people should be
flying, from sheer want of work, from a
country which has a population of only Jive
persons to every four square miles ! —a
country, too, whose “ magnificent natural
resources ” form the wheeze and platitude of
every dull politician ; and that even South
Africa, ruined by war and swarming with
cheap nigger labour, should occur to them
as a place that it is good to go to if
only they can get away from the land
of M‘Milt,an, Bruce Smith and co. It
suggests that Australia has somehow “missed
the ’bus,” and that it has lived in vain
and fooled away a great opportunity.. In
N.S. Wales alone persons with money were
recently said to be applying at the rate of
60 a week for permission to go to the burnt
lands of South Africa, and N.S. Wales is
better off just now than some of its neighbors
—mostly because it is floating larger loans.
Such a state of things suggests that Australia
has “ missed the ’bus ” in an aggravated
form.

In N.S. Wales Assembly last week the
Owb’ Sullivan arose as usual, and explained
what measures were going to be taken out of
loan money to “afford relief to the unem-
ployed ’’ this winter. Works Ministers
in Australia rise about four times a year
on an average to explain what measures are
to be taken out of loan money to afford
relief to the unemployed, who are in a parlous
state owing to the approach of a cold winter,
or a dry spring, or a hot summer, or a late
autumn, as the case may be. In every case
the relief takes the form of public works—
and even the kind of public works that are
supposed to yield direct revenue are only
valuable when there are people to use them,
and unless there are more genuine industries
to support these people it is hopeless to sup-
pose that these people will be founci here
permanently to any great extent. There is
a constant making of roads which lead, not to
big factories and other permanent indus-
tries, but to some place where the bones of
dead animals lie on a plain. There is a
perpetual making of bridges to connect some
dying western town with some other place
that is practically dead, or to join a wilder-
ness and a waste together, and of railways to
“ afford access ” to places which no sane
person wants access to, until there is some-
thing better to do there than wrest five-
bushel crops from a barren soil, and then
pay 300 miles of land carriage and 16,000
miles of sea carriage to convey them to a
glutted foreign market. There is no serious
effort to provide any industry worth going
to at the end of these roads and railways,
and though roads are good when they lead to
any visible means of support, and bridges
are valuable when they enable a man
to get across to a permanent job on the
other side, yet merely as places for de-
mented and unemployed swagmen to walk on,
with corks hanging from their hats and no
definite prospect of getting anywhere in
particular, they are not worth having. Aus-
tralia doesn’t require new roads just at
present nearly so much as it requires to build
industries along the roads italready possesses,
so that a self-supporting population may use
them in getting to its remunerative employ-
ment in the morning and oack at night.
One of the most depressing facts imaginable
is to walk or ride 40 miles along a well-made
highway, and meet one unemployed swag-
man, and a dray bringing up imported goods
to the store m some far township, and two
men mending the road out of loan funds,
and ten men building a bridge out of loan
funds, and the mail-coach, supported by a
Government subsidy, carrying a solitary
passenger, who is a Government inspector of
something or other.

Australia imports more foreign goods, in
proportion to population, for its own use—
not for transhipment to other States—
than any other country on earth. Its
imports are principally manufactured goods.
Therefore it has more opportunities
than other countries to find permanent
and profitable employment for its
people—the people who are now leaving it
in disgust and making for Africa—by
stopping some of these imports and manu-
facturing for itself. Unfortunately, Aus-
tralia has hitherto been too much addicted
to Revenue Tariffism, or to a weak and in-
efficient form of Protection, for its manufac-
turing industries to get a fair hold. In many
lines this country has to compete with vastly
more expert foreigners, who, in lands where
food and rent are cheap, can work and be
comparatively affluent for 3s. 6d. a day. The
Australian would become equally expert in
time, but he can’t expect to be so at the
outset. And the Australian manufacturer is
expected to pay ss. to 7s. or more per day—
if he can’t there is generally some O’Sullivan
about, who is willing to pay that much out
of loan funds for cutting scrub at some place
where the scrub will grow again next year,
or digging a hole that will silt up again next
month. The Foreign-trade party, and a large
section of the Labor party, profess to believe
that it is utterly wrong to subsidise, by
bonuses, or by Protective duties which will
bring in a certain amount of revenue, some
permanent producing industry, which may
save the country £1,000,000 a year in imports
and enable that amount to be distributed in
wages. It never sees anything wrong in
subsidising, on a far larger scale, out of loan
funds, some temporary scrub-cutting or
comparatively useless road-making job which
brings in no revenue, but costs a large
amount in interest, and possibly a good deal
in maintenance. And if the non-Pro-
tected or insufficiently Protected manu-
facturer can’t compete, in point of wages,
with the enormously-subsidised scrub-cutting
job—the job on which every penny of the
wages is a bonus—he has to go.
* * * ♦
N.S.W. professed, for many years, to be
run on Freetrade principles, and though it
protected some industries very heavily, and
thereby kept its Freetrade theory out of the
Benevolent Asylum under false pretences, it
did practise Freetrade as regards many in-
dustries. With regard to these industries,
the would-be manufacturer was simply told :
“In many foreign lands, where rents
and food are cheap, your industries are
run by expert artisans at 3s. 6d. a day.
Setting the Protection you gain by sea-
freights to Australia against the fact that you
must begin work with less experienced
artisans, you will probably be able to do the
same work if you can find able-bodied men at
3s. 6d. a day.” And if the Freetrade Govern-
ment had insisted on having all its public
works performed similarly at European rates
the position would have been logical. Then,'
either there would never have been any
public works or any manufactures run on
Freetrade principles, or else the rate of
wages would have fallen to 3s. 6d. a day all
round, and there would have been a corres-
ponding fall in rents and other things, and
everybody would have had a fair deal. But,
while it recognised the necessity of paying a
higher wage than the European rate on
public works, it didn’t recognise, except in a
few instances, the necessity for paying a
higher wage in manufacturing enterprises.
It laid down the law that this country
mustn’t 'make calico unless it could do
it at European cost, while the equally
logical law that it shouldn’t make roads
and railways unless at European wages,
was ignored. It refused to make £lOOO
worth of spades and picks unless they could
be made at German cost, but it didn’t mind
buying them and then paying £2OOO in wages
(out of loan moneys) in uselessly shifting
sand with them, in order to find work for
men who might have been better employed
making them.. It held that it was wrong to
make rails if they could be made more
cheaply in Europe, and it had no scruples
about paying men (out of loans) nearly twice
the European rate to turn these rails into a
railway which wouldn’t pay axle-grease. It
wouldn t pay, under a Protective tariff, the
amount extra for paint which would repre-
sent the difference between Australian wages
(artificially fixed, to some extent at least, by
the rate paid out of loan money on public
works) and (say) Italian wages, but it had no
scruple about paying the men whom this
policy left unemployed, a high wage for
daubing that paint on the railings of Hyde
Park, Sydney.
* * » •
Even in the protected States the Protec-
tion was, in many cases, wholly inadequate.
All over Australia the manufacturer, in many
lines, was put in a position to pay European
rates, or perhaps as much as 50 per cent,
over European rates, while the State paid in
many cases twice these rates to its great
mass of public employees. In many cases
the manufacturer was left to compete, with
no Protection at all, against skilled European
artisans in countries where a man can be
reasonably well off at 3s. 6d. a day, while
the Government paid ss. a day for what was
practically pauper relief. Asa result, manu-
factures never flourished as they should have
done. N.S.W., the worst sample of the
Freetrade policy, produces less value per
head of manufactured goods than even poor
bankrupt Spain ; less than Austria, Scandi-
navia, or Holland ; not half as much as
Switzerland, Canada, France, or Germany ;
about a-quarter as much per head as the
United States. And by reason of this, some
O’Sullivan or other has been rising for
many years with new loan schemes for the
relief of the unemployed. If there had
never been any O’Sullivan, either the
public would have demanded Protection, or
else there would have been a general fall in
wages, with a corresponding fall in rents,
and manufactures might have made some
headway. But the Man with the Owe was
always in the road.
♦ ♦ *
The exodus to South Africa and the new
rising of O’Sullivan with a scheme for the
relief of the unemployed (O’Sullivan, having
no control of the country’s fiscal policy, is,
of course, not now wholly responsible for the
situation) are two results of this system. The
people who have higher ambitions than to
toil at agriculture in a drear land, where
agriculture is worth about 15s. a week, and
who don’t want pauper relief out of the
recent £7,000,000 loans, are going away.
The Labor members in the Federal Parlia-
ment have just refused to vote some
£300,000 or £400,000 to start works which,
it was expected, would give permanent
employment at good wages to 3000 men
and probably prevent £1,000,000 a year
going out of N.S.W. alone to pay for
imports. The Labor members in N.S.W.
State Parliament are understood to cordially
approve of schemes to spend more than that
in relief jobs which will involve a large
annual outgoing in interest, and merely
afford temporary aid to about the same num-
ber of men. Sanuford, of Lithgow, accord-
ing to appearances at time of writing, must
either find men who will work at such a rate
as will enable him to compete with English
and other outside rivals, or else abandon his
proposed new industry. But the rule doesn't
apply all round ; the unemployed who are
to be assisted by the new loan scheme won’t
be expected, by any means, to compete
against Austrian or Italian pick-and-sliovel
rates. And by reason of this refusal to put
the permanent industry on anything like the
same wage level as the relief job, the rising
of O’Sullivan and his kind to propound
loan schemes in aid of the unemployed has
become a permanent Australian rising, and
if M'Millan and co. have their way much
longer with the Federal tariff, it is likely to
continue so.
N.S.W. Arbitration Act.
It is natural that there should be a feeling of
uneasiness, even of grave discontent, among the
trades-unions at the first important decision of
the N.S W. Arbitration Court, which is adverse to
their claims. Compulsory Arbitration has been
always put forward as a “labor measure,” as a
means by which the worker could more readily
secure that fairer distribution of the fruits of
labor which the justice of modern sociology sug-
gests. It is, therefore, disquieting to the workers
to find that compulsory arbitration can cut both
ways, and penalise trades-unions acting unfairly,
as well as capitalists acting unfairly. The volun-
tary Conciliation and Arbitration Act in N.S.W.,
it will be remembered, began its operations sorne-
what similarly. A Southern coal-mining case
having been referred to it for decision, the verdict
was, in the main, unfavorable to the trades-union
and excited serious discontent, though its justice
was not ser’ously questioned. The voluntary act,
partly on account of that decision, was practically
a dead letter afterwards. The present Act cannot
become a dead letter, since any person, employer
or employee, may bring his grievance to its
arbitrament, whether the other party to the cause
is willing or not. Trades-unions must, therefore,
whether they care to or not, make the best of it.
That should not be a-difficult task.
♦ * • *
What has to be remembered is that the Arbi-
tration Court is bound by its oath to administer
justice to both sides in an industrial case--not the
theoretic-justice represented by “ Socialism in our •
time,” or communism, but what is practical fair
play under existing conditions of society. It is
empowered—indeed, ordered—to give preference
to members of trades-unions as against non-
unionists, and, consequently, as a matter
of fair play, it must take care that
every working-man is given a reasonable
chance of becoming a trades-unionist. It would
be intolerable tyranny otherwise. So far,
the decisions of the Court have held an even
balance. In the Newcastle case the employers
were ordered to employ: union labor, and the
decision generally was in favor of the workers.
In the Australian Workers’ -Union case, the
application of the Union to cancel the registration
of a rival, seemingly promoted by thB pastoralist
employers for the purpose of combatting the
A.W.U., was refused, with a strong inferential
suggestion that the A.W.U. might be deprived of
its status as a registered union if formal applica-
tion were made. This decision was all in favor of
the employers, and was arrived at by a majority
verdict —Mr. Smith, the workers’ representative
on the Bench, dissenting.
* * *
But it is impossible to allege that the decision was
anything but just. The A. W.U., through its own
mistake, was debarred from bringing forward any
material evidence to support its allegation that
the Machine Shearers’ Union was a “ bogus ”
organisation. This was on a “ technicality,” but
a very necessary technicality. No court of jus-
tice could carry on its business unless there was a
preliminary process of defining the issues for trial
beforehand, and unless it subsequently confined the
proceedings strictly within those issues. Further,
the Court proceedings showed that in the A.W.U.
code there were rules which it was impossible for
any court of justice in a free country to compel the
workers in the pastoral industry to subscribe to.
These rules were designed with the object of com-
pelling every A.W.U. member to vote ‘‘the
Labor ticket ” at all elections, and provided
stringent penalties for any A.W.U. member
who spoke, worked, or voted against a Labor
candidate. It would be utterly undemocratic
for the State to attempt to compel a man
into certain political convictions —however ad-
mirable in theory—on penalty of losing or
seriously prejudicing his chances of employ-
ment. The A.W.U. should recognise this, and
promptly amend its rules. There will be no
reason then why members, if they choose to do so
should not form a parallel political organisation
on the lines of a Political Labor League.
* * * *
The Arbitration Court, it will be noted, took
the broad view that a trades-union may spend its
funds on printing a newspaper for propaganda
purposes : and that shows a liberal idea of the
rights and functions of trades-unionism. But it
is obvious that trades-unions must recognise that
the system of compulsory arbitration has its
penalties as well as its benefits. The price to be
paid for a legal enforcement of trades-unionism,
and for the establishment of a Court of Justice to
regulate hours of labor and wages, is that the union
in each trade and calling must be open to every
decent, skilful workman, and must impose no
political, religious, or other unfair restriction on
its members. Possibly other organisations besides
the A.W.U. will find it necessary to make altera-
tions in their rules. But the benefit to be gained
—the almost absolute insurance against strikes
and lock-outs —will be worth the sacrifice.

A Lost Joss.
The debate on the Federal Bonus Bill aroused
William M‘Millan to state firmly (according to
the report in Sydney Telegraph) that he would
not be a party to the “ creation of a new industry
by means of Protection and a bonus, for which, so
far, the people had given no mandate.” This
arouses curious recollections of the time when
this same unflinching M‘Millan, and the
equally unflinching Bruce Smith, were suc-
cessively Treasurers in a N.S.W. Foreign-
trade Ministry, which held office on a man-
date from the people to rule the State on
Foreign-trade principles. And that Ministry
heavily protected, among other things, sugar,
tobacco, cigars, wine, beer, apples, bacon, bis ;i
cuits, butter, candles, cement, cheese, confec ;
tionery, cornflour, galvanised iron, iron wire, wire
■ netting, lead pipes, hams, tongues, jams, jellies,
preserved milk, molasses, treacle, nails, 15 different
kinds of oil, paint, salt, shot, timber of almost
every kind, and newspapers. It sacrificed a vast
amountof moneyin protecting many of these things
—if it had levied an excise on local beer, sugar
tobacco, cigars, and wine equal to the "duty
charged on the imported goods, the Treasury
would have been much better off and its sacred
principles would have been saved. While it could
hold on to its sordid portfolios and its unclean
salaries (for money obtained by preaching one
thing and practising another is unclean) the
“ mandate of the people,” about which M ‘Millan
is now so agitated in his soul, didn’t matter two-
pence. And the same soiled proceeding can be
charged, in exactly the same degree, against
Gould, and Pumpkin Smith, and in a less degree
against Reid and Joseph Cook. Also the rank
and file which supported the old Parkes and Reid
Ministries, and a good part of which is now in the
Federal Parliament preaching the creed it didn’t
follow, is included in the same condemnation.
• * * •
These men, but principally M ‘Millan, Bruce
Smith, Gould, and the Pumpkin Smith person,
shamefully disregarded the distinct mandate oi
the people—which was bad ; and in the light of
that proceeding their present high moral attitude
of snuffle is outrageous hypocrisy and, politically
speaking, worthy of the late T. Oates. And they
did worse than disregard the popular mandate.
They created, or maintained, a considerable num-
ber of protected industries in New South Wales,
and they systematically pointed to these in-
dustries as a proof of the prosperity that
came of Freetrade. Their Freetrade was a lie and
a degrading imposture all through, and there
was neither truth, honor, nor public decency
in it. To practise Protection in a very large
degree while they declared that Protection was
injurious, was either gross treachery or something
equally bad. It was also a selling of their own
brass deity, and the work of a gang of political


Iscariots. To maintain industries by Protection,
and then, directly or indirectly, to ascribe the
prosperity of Protected industries to the Freetrade
system was political false pretences. Likewise, it
was bearing false witness against their neighbor,
and stealing the credit which belonged to a system
they reviled. It was preaching teetotalism with
a red nose and a shaky hand and a strong whisky
breath. It was a low-down process of living, and
having their job and their salary, by means of a
thing they said they abhorred. M ‘MiI LAN, at all
events, had his reward. The Government he
helped to disfigure didn’t levy a protective tax on
the goods he imported, and thereby create a
local industry that might haye damaged his
business and supplied the public with employ-
ment. By protecting, without a mandate from
the people, many other things, his party
was able, for very many years, to keep in
office, and keep out of office the real Protectionist
party which would have taxed M ‘Millan’s goods.
If the various apostate Governments with which
he was connected, or which he supported, had
practised real Freetrade the chances are that the
feneral ruin which would haye followed would
ave brought in a real Protectionist Government
—a calico-taxing Government —in very short order.
* * * *
Every time any member of the old Parkes and
Reid Governments addresses the Federal Parlia-
ment on the advantages of Freetrade he should be
asked to explain, first of all, why he never dared to
practise it even when lie had a mandate from the
people to do so, and pretended to be doing so,
and was in office for the express purpose of doing
so. That question wants answering before all
others. A creed which is so dirty that its own
advocates dare not touch it even now except by
instalments, is no creed for Australia. Not one of
the Freetrade leaders has dared to suggest putting
the excise on beer, for instance, on a level with
the import duty, and letting the blessings of com-
mercial freedom and increased public revenue
blow on the muddy beverage ; and that is only
one case out of many. The alleged prosperity of
N.S.W. under Freetrade is a lie, for N.S.W. never
had Freetrade. In N.S.W. that doctrine has
always been a fraud, a job, and an imposture, and
the alleged Freetrade Ministers of N.S.W. have
always been either impostors holding office under
false pretence, or traitors deliberately doing what
they believed to be injury to their own State and
their own people—being either hired to do so by
foreign enemies who are still at large, or doing it
out of their own natural wickedness. They
always denied their own brass deity in prac-
tice, and they preached him and rejected
him at the same time. Their callous, brutal
system wouldn’t have lasted a year if it had been
really put into force ; the best proof of that fact
is that M'Millan and his party knew a great deal
better than to ever really put it into force. If they
were offered Ministerial office now on condition
that they protected no industry whatever—that
every duty levied for revenue purposes on im-
ported goods should be accompanied by an equiva-
lent excise duty on the local product, and that
there should be no surreptitious Protection by
the faking of railway rates or otherwise, it
is quite safe to wager, on their past re-
cords, that they wouldn’t take office, badly as
they want it. The Freetrade creed only lives in
Australia by never being put to the test. Its
apostles only kept on top by telling a gullible
people persistently for many years that they
were practising it, while to a great extent
they practised the other thing. It has been the
longest-lived hoax, and the most impudent fraud,
and the cheekiest three-card, trick in Australia’s
history, and it is time Australia realised the fact.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Dead Premier’s Send-Off.
Just before poor George Leake died and left the
Westralian Premiership to Ktngsmill (who hasn’t
been able to hold it, and is turning the task over
to that amiable lawyer, James), Perth Morning
Herald again spoke to him very severely about
the wickedness of having a surplus and proposing
to use it for railway construction, instead of
floating the usual loan. It said :
There is one aspect of the case against the sliding scale
that does not seem to be fully understood by the general
public, and that is its absolutely unconstitutional charac-
ter. Mr. Nanson, who is one of the most vigorous advo-
cates of the sliding scale, in his speech at Queen’s Hall,
took exception to the proposals of the Government in
reference to the expenditure of the surplus revenue. He
touched on the question very lightly, merely indicating
that the works proposed to be carrried out might more
properly be undertaken out of loan money. Mr. Nanson,
however, was unable to suggest a means of spending an
annual surplus of £300,000 without either wasting it
or else devoting it to national undertakings fair It/ charge-
able to loans. We have supported the proposals of the
Government in regard to the surplus revenue simply on
the ground that they offer almost the only alternative
to the frittering away of the money, but, at the
time, we are bound to endorse to some extent the
objections raised by Mr. Nanson. The bare fact of the
matter is that there is no proper and constitutional
method of spending a surplus of £300,000 per annum, for
the simple reason that there is no constitutional method
by which such a surplus can be obtained. May, in his
Parliamentary practice, puts the position very clearly
when he says:
“ The Commons do not vote money unless it be required
by the Crown, nor do they impose or augment taxes
unless such taxes be necessary for the public service, as
declared by the Crown through its constitutional
advisers.”
The practice of raising unnecessary revenue by taxation
is quite unconstitutional, and that the revenue from the
sliding scale is unnecessary is demonstrated by the
existence of the surplus. No supporter of constitutional
government can record his vote in favor of the Leake
Administration.
There is a magnificent ignorance, or else a
fine solid capacity for misrepresentation in
quoting May, the great English Parliamentary
authority,as a proof that it is “unconstitutional”
to build public works out of revenue. In Great
Britain all the public works done by the national
Government are paid out of revenue (the item
runs to £8,000,000 or £10,000,000 in a year, in-
cluding barracks, &c.), likewise all new telegraphs,
post-offices, &c. ; and in addition, in ordinary
years, about £6,000,000 is applied in reduction of
the public debt. The English Parliamentary
authority is solid enough on the fact that, after
all public works have been paid for out of taxa-
tion, no needless taxes should be levied, but he
doesn’t consider the £6.000,000 a year raised in
repayment of the public debt needless taxation by
any means. Perth Morning Herald’s demand
that the dead Premier should be thrown out
because he proposed, in a State which has already
the appalling debt of £67 per head, to build two
small railways out of revenue ; and its declaration
that it is “unconstitutional” not to run into
debt; and that the sin of trying to keep down
the public liabilities in the boom days, so that the
burden may be less disastrous in the burst days
that must follow just as surely as night follows
day, called for his ejection from office—all these
things are a sorry example of the mental dry-rot
which has come upon Australia. At the time of
his death George Leake was the only Australian
Premier who hadn’t a big shortage to' add to the
public liabilities. Probably he didn’t fully realise
the sin of not having a shortage till his miserably
stupid newspaper adviser drew his attention to it.
♦
The Transcontinental Land-drab.
The party which seeks to negotiate with a syndi-
cate to complete the transcontinental line from
Port Darwin to Adelaide on the land swindle
principle is confident of success. Premier Jen-
kins Iscariot has announced that he is with it,
just as Jenkins Iscariot was with the Adelaide
tram syndicate job; and the Tory party in both
Houses is with it. Also, a great many other
people who would, under different circumstances,
be against it, favor the idea as a way of defeating
what they regard as a mean conspiracy on the
part of Queensland and N.S.W. to secure the
Territory’s trade. These latter people have cer-
tainly some show of a reasonable grievance.
Adelaide is nearer to Port Darwin than is either
Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, or Perth. The
S.A. people have constructed a great part of the
railway already, and would have constructed it
all had money been available. They have ad-
ministered the Territory, and carried the burden
of its ill-luck and its deficit. Now a small party
of shameless grabsters has arisen with a proposal
that,. if the Federal Government takes over the
Territory, instead of carrying the Territory rail-
way straight south to connect with the Adelaide
line at Oodnadatta, it should be deflected away to
the east to bring the business over a much longer
route to Sydney, via a proposed Federal capital
at Canoblas, all the trade of which would also go
to Sydney. The scheme includes an arrangement
for buying the support of Queensland by connect-
ing the new line with the Brisbane and Rockhamp-
ton railways in passing. This, of course, sacrifices
the idea of a transcontinental railway altogether ;
the proposed line would be merely a line going
diagonally across a comer of Australia. It would
be longer, and it would make a great part of the
688 miles of transcontinental line already con-
structed from Adelaide to Oodnadatta a lost
enterprise, or nearly so. But it would bring the
trade to Sydney, and, in the view of a certain
small but loud and pernicious gang, that is the
beginning, middle, and end of all things
in this country. A great quantity of
literature has been circulated, with maps
showing the Federal capital at Sydney’s
back door, and the great Diagonal Railway which
is to bring the products of the Northern Territory
through that capital to Circular Quay. Ade-
laide has taken this unprincipled and enormously
insolent grab-scheme more seriously than it
deserves. It hasn’t the money to go on with the
transcontinental at once. It has a fear, carefully
fostered by the Tory party and sedulously culti-
vated by large land-grabbers, that if it hands over
the Territory to the Federal authority without
first committing that body in some way to complete
the existing line, the party which wants to bring
everything to Sydney, regardless of cost, will get
the existing Port Darwin-Pine Creek railway de-
flected into N.S.W., and Adelaide will be left. A
considerable number of the people are almost
ready to job away the whole Territory as a land-
grant to any syndicate that will build the line, and
thus make the defeat of the Sydney grab idea cer-
tain. S.A. is willing to give the Territory to the
Commonweath —that is to say, it has offered it to
the Federal Parliament, and got no answer. It
reckons that it will cost it no more to give the great
province to some private jobbers, and, if it there-
by secures the Territory trade, it may even
cost it a little less. Under these conditions
it is more than ever desirable that the Federal
Parliament should take over the Territory at an
early date, and put its foot on the nefarious land-
grant scheme. It is equally desirable that in
taking over the Territory it should make it clear
that the insolent grab scheme of the Canoblas
Federal Capital push, for bringing the Territory’s
trade by a sidelong railway to Port Jackson, and
dragging it up and down the Blue Mountains on
the way, has no Federal sympathy whatever. The
trade, by the way, would probably, in any case,
do Sydney much less good than is supposed.
Half-a-dozen new boot-factories, to make the
boots that are now imported, might be of much
more permanent value. Certainly, the trade
would do Sydney far less good than it would
Adelaide; every extra mile of distance diminishes
the value of commerce.

. An Order of Merit 1
There is bitter sarcasm on the whole “title”
business in the establishment of an Order of
Merit by King Edward, with a first list of
recipients who decidedly merit honor, if honor
can be conferred by a mere enthroned man. The
theory used to be that all the kingly Orders
were for “merit”—the Garter, the Bath, the
Thistle, the Cross of Michael and George
and all the other knighthoods, some with
their suggestions of immorality, others of the
servile abasement of the Middle Ages. That
theory can now hardly be longer tenable when
there is one “order” for people of merit, as dis-
tinguished from the people who crowd into the
orders which commemorate -King’s courtesans and
other incidents of Royal life. There is now more
hope for a general recognition of the truth that
titles are only the business devices intended to
prop up the anachronistic institution of a monarchy
by recruiting champions for it among the most sue
cessful of the bourgeoisie. A great seller of beer,
a pirate of the tea-trade, a notable captain of
industry, a successfully dishonest politician, pro-
gresses from a K.C.M.G. to a baronetcy or a peer-
age, because the monarchy sees the need of
attaching to itself by bonds of self-interest those
who have shown great capacity for exploiting their
fellow-men. Merit —not even the merit of the
beer, the tea, or the politics dealt in—has no rela-
tion at all to the title. In fact, within certain limits
bad beer, bad tea, and mischievous politics are-
more sure steps to the peerage than good articles
of those descriptions, for by dealing in inferior
articles successfully there is more money to be
made in a certain time, more sure capacity shown
for exploiting the people. The system of royal
honors has succeeded so well in corrupting poli-
tics, in attaching to the monarchical interest most
of the energy of. the bourgeois party, that it is
matter for surprise that King Edward, by his
Order of Merit, should throw upon it a grave
reflection. A monarchy would be saved from such
mistakes if it had a sense of humor.

The Question of Water Supply.
The “most important question in Australia.’
dragged into N.S.W. Assembly by a motion for’
adjournment, produced an inconsequential debate.
Ministers talked vaguely about light railways,
water conservation, and artesian wells. Ex-
Ministers pleaded guilty to past neglect, and mem-
bers generally did little more than air vapid
imaginings. The proposal was that £200,000 a
year should be expended on water conservation.
Where the money was to come from, or how it
should be expended, did not seem to concern any-
one. The mischief is that it has not concerned
the present or any other Govt, since the days when
a beginning was made in selling the land and
squandering the proceeds. There is no inten-
tion of providing the money save by borrowing,
and there are no plans ready for even such
works as would serve the country with the
first good rain. Yet much might be done.
Dams might be constructed across the supply
channels of the great backwaters, with sluice-
gates to let the flood in, and hold the water
when the rivers begin to fall. Also £100,009
might be profitably expended in sinking artesian
wells within a year. The first of these measures
would put a few of the unemployed to profitable
use, the second would render a few thousand
acres available for fodder-growing. But neither
the one nor the other would afford adequate.relief
in the present, nor safeguard the State against a
possibly disastrous future. N.S. Wales is suffer-
ing now for the unthrift, the negligence, the folly
of half a century. The State is like a farmer who,
coming into a mixed estate, sold all the best
patches, mortgaged the balance and had a good
time while spending the proceeds. A bad
time following such a course is apt to be
bitter; and bitter is the lot, and blue
the outlook of N.S.W. at the present time.
Neither academic discussion nor apologetic ad-
missions will mend it. Reform must begin on the
inner edge and stretch right out. The condition
of the county of Cumberland is more disgraceful
than that of the Western Division. Large
volumes of the Hawkesbury flood-waters could be
turned to profit in every year. Dr. Lang dis-
cerned that 60 years back. And if the watershed
of the tributaries of that river were intelligently
handled, N.S.W. would have a full lake at Pros-
pect and cultivated green fields right up to the
mountain feet in any drought. The same applies
to a dozen districts along the coast, and in a less
degree to a good many big patches about the
middle courses of the westward flowing rivers.
Further out, surface storage and artesian supply
have possibilities which have never yet been esti-
mated, and which certainly will not, under any
circumstances, be fully realised by this genera-
tion. Still, there might be a beginning, and, so
far as all information available shows, there is no
prospect of that m the minds of any responsible
people. Water famine is menacing Sydney now
as directly as starvation menaces any Western
bullock dragging out life on a dry plain, yet
the Water Commissioners have not got be-
yond telling the people to be careful,
and the Government is “considering.” The
only irrigation plant ever put down beside the
Hawkesbury waters is dismantled and advertised
for sale. Now it would pay its cost in a single
season, and neither Gov rnment nor Parliament
has any ideas of new and practical developments
there. Further out, what is there but talk and
froth ? What is the outcome of the Western
Districts Commission and of half-a-dozen State
trips across the desert ? Is there any place ready,
or getting ready, which would justify Parliament
in voting a million of money ? Is there anybody
in charge fit for the occasion ? A negative reply
may not carry us much further, but if the country
evinced a determination that fitness for Minis-
terial position should be proved by adequate
dealing with the water conservation business,
something might be tabled which would merit
serious discussion. But what can be hoped for
from a State whose Parliament devotes a fort-
night to a battle for office over a reduction-of-
members question, and a futile night to a matter
which involves the stock, the credit, the very
lives of a large percentage of its people?

The Cry of Vaile.
A person named Vaile has arisen in Auckland
(M.L.) Chamber of Commerce and moved “ That
in the opinion of this meeting the time has
arrived when Great Britain, her colonies and de-
pendencies, should seriously consider what means
can be devised to attract the overflow of popula-
tion of the United Kingdom to said colonies and
dependencies; also that the foregoing resolution
be forwarded to London Chamber of Commerce
with a request that it would help to carry out the
idea.” Vaile appears to be threatened with sense.
For many, many years about 70 per cent, of the
overflow of the United Kingdom has streamed
away to the U.S.A., Argentina and other foreign
places, and this proportion is increasing. Mean-
while, the map have taken to marking a very
large area of Britain as “unpopulated,” despite the
increase of city population. Canada holds out all
sorts of inducements to immigrants, and yet
it gets only a fraction compared with the
United States. Maoriland has respectable land
laws, but Maoriland is a long way off.
Australia has no land laws, speaking in a civilised
manner; and it, too, is a long way off, and, in
addition, is a poor land cursed with droughts,
ticks, Philp Governments and other plagues.
S’Africa is only fit for capitalists ; the ever-
increasing supply of cheap black labor scares away
the industrious white man with little capital but
strong arms and pluck. A few years ago the only
trades affected by the blacks were the navvies’and
blacksmiths’. To-day Hindus run shops, Malays
do the carpentering, Cingalese run tailoring estab-
lishments, Chinamen do the gardening and laun-
drying, and at least one firm has taken to
employing Babu clerks. Of course, there is no
reason, except misgovernment, why the English-
man should want to emigrate at all. There are a
few enormously congested localities in the United
Kingdom where the bulk of the ever-inereasing
population is centred, but more than half the
country averages about 40 persons to the sq. mile.
But the heavy rents demanded by aristocratic land-
lords, and the enormous taxes levied on land to
make up for the want of customs revenue (sacri-
ficed in the interests of Freetrade) make it pay
better to grow wheat for the London market in
the middle United States, where they don’t
crush the local agriculturist with taxes to avoid
taxing the foreigner, and where there are no
lordly or ducal landlords on the English scale,
than in England itself. So the farmer who wants
to grow wheat for London leaves the vicinity of
London, and goes to America from motives of
economy. His fixed resolution to make for a place
with a high, reliable Protective tariff is quite
remarkable.

Mr. H. V. Wigg, an alderman, or something, of
Grenfell (N.S.W.), has just issued a pamphlet re-
printing a speech made by him on Feb. 27 in
regard to the Boer war. The speech is a wild
denunciation of the Anti-War League, and its
publication is just now most opportune. From it
we learn that the Boers started the late war from
“racial hatred ” ; that they opened it by “sack-
ing, burning, or horribly and filthily desecrating”
British homes in Cape Colony; that they were
guilty of white-flag treachery; that they had
incurred “a huge and terrible debt of vengeance ”
to the natives, whom they had oppressed ; that
their character was marked by “invincible un-
cleanliness, dense and appalling ignorance and
callous indifference”; that the Boers “arequite in-
capable of understanding a generous act in war ” ;
and finally this :
And remember, if England gives way now in South
Africa she must lose prestige. It is a “ fight Co the
finish ” for one or the other. Unconditional surrender of
the Boers means that the Old Flag’ is victorious, and
England the conqueror dictating her own terms. Any
other terms, if granted, would mean that she stands
beaten, submitting to terms instead of dictating them.
For the honor of our race this must not be.
This was the language of every Jingo from Cham-
berlain downwards until Feb., 1902. But isn’t
it almost high treason now ? Does Mr. Wigg
dare say now that England “stands beaten,” and
that the people to which she has pledged herself
to give full self-government, and to whom she
sends soft messages welcoming them as worthy
fellow - citizens, are full of racial hatred, of
treachery, of cruelty, of appalling ignorance,
and so on ?

One of the unscrupulous dodges by which the
Philp Government, and the mendacious news-
papers which pimp for it, have endeavored to
raise public wrath against the Federal Govern-
ment is the tale of the civilised kanaka who is to
be compulsorily returned to his island by the
process of a callous Federal law. He is to be cast
back into savagery—probably killed and eaten by
a tribe which has forgotten him. At last Acting-
Premier Deakin has grown weary of all this, and
has in effect called the whole Philp crowd an
Ananias. He has written to the dreadful
Queensland person, pointing out that the
only new element in the Federal anti-Kanaka law
is that it limits, and finally abolishes, the import-
ation of new Kanakas. The return of the
civilised Queensland nigger to his old savagery
among the islands is provided for under a (pre-
sumably brutal and callous) Queensland State
law, passed by the (presumably savage and un-
feeling) party to which Philp belongs, and which
he now leads. Deakin’s surprise that Philp and
co. should have originated and maintained laws
which they declare to be so grossly inhuman is
expressed m a way that should pierce the hide of
a rhinoceros.

“F.”: Melbourne Women’s Hospital is now living
above its income to the extent of about .£2OOO a
year, and the managerial dames and spinsters are
talking of a special effort to put the maintenance
fund in credit. If the special effort results in a
conspicuous failure, as it probably will, some of
the wards will have to be closed. The writer,
who doesn’t believe in smacking lovely woman
when she is down, begins to feel rather sorry for
the so-called “catmittee” of this discredited in-
stitution, whose want of funds will be attribu ed
to their want of fitness to run the show. As a
matter of fact increased expenditure accounts for
one-third of the £2OOO a year shortage in the
Women’s Hospital income, whilst the falling off in
the subscription is, perhaps, partly due to the
hospital's loss of prestige through the publication
of scandalous wrangles between the “catmittee”
and the male medical staff. The man in the street
who talks as though he were a liberal subscriber
to hospitals (which he isn’t), and a well-informed
critic of their management (which he isn’t), has
already jumped to the conclusion that the
“catmittee” are exasperating meddlers, one
and all, whereas the male medical professionals
are a crowd of noble, unselfish toilers, now engaged
in “ boycotting” the institution because they have
only its welfare at heart. This seems to be the
popular view of the situation among the multitude
whodon’thelpto keep thecharity going, rather than
among the few who do, and whose subscriptions
show a falling off on account of bad times and the
recent fashionable exodus to London. The popular
view is altogether wrong as regards most of the
“ cats ”on the Women’s Hospital executive. Two
or three of the “ cats ” may be almost as bad as all
of them are painted, and these two or three sour
eross-examinersof “fallen” girls, these distempered
autocrats of the maternity ward, have brought
the general management into disrepute. But
the Hospital is something more than a place for the
production of babies. It has wards for the treat-
ment of other than maternity complaints, and on
the whole it gets more praise from outcoming
patients than is given to other Melbourne hospitals
that have escaped scandal. The trouble between
the catmittee and the medical men is mainly a
sex-fight, arising from grievances on both sides.
Interference which should have been countered
with manly tact has been resented with unpardon-
able insolence. When the dogs cease barking at
them the cats will purr again, and that’s all about
it, or nearly all about it.
“Chass.” to The Bulletin re the position in the
Victorian Msdlee: —
“ Glenara’s ” (8./5/’O2) S.YV. Vic. tenant system was
too optimistic. The present season promises to be one of
the worst ever known. The provision made for water
on the plains is wholly inadequate to the needs of the
heavy increase of population, and most of the new
settlers have to take up the old weary game of water-
carting. At present one small council dam is supplying
most of them, and if that gives out 1 The land
around here, until recently rented at less than 2s. 3d. per
acre for sheep raising, was, in one case, sold at 525. fid.
per acre because it wouldn’t return even that small
amount at grazing. During three good years, with mild,
dry winters and opportune spring rains, the old
farmers obtained good crops by the use of heavy
and expensive dressings of superphosphates, and
realised good prices owing to the Boer war and the
drought further north. These things, with a general
eye by interested parties to pickings, commissions, and
big rents, created a boom and a general rush for laud
here. But the end is not yet. With chaff about £5 a
ton, on a bleak wind-swept piain, without firewood, with
miserable kipsies for themselves, and worse shelter for
their horses—the last state of the mallee-farmer is worse
than the first. What the drought has done for them
up north, landlords, machine-agents, storekeepers,
and low prices (certain to come shortly) will do for
them here. The price fixed by the landlords leaves
no chance of them ever being anything but human
slaves. Land that old fanners bought for £3 per acre,
and struggled for years to clear of debt, has been run up
to double that figure. In fact the tenant-system here is
the straw at which the drowning man catches. The
landlord is as merciless as the drought-fiend in the north,
and as certain in his workings. Yet some of the big
estates were offered to Govt, at 50s. and 525. 6d. an acre.
At that price a crust could be made, but Peacock and
co. were then busy over the Boer-farm-burning business ;
and the Age was yelling wildly about watering the mallee,
which will never grow wheat. By the time water
reaches there the farmer will be gone, and Lascellbs and
Co. will scoop the benefit of the huge expenditure of
ratepayers’ money,; and when the landlord works his
ruin here, about the best and toughest material to build
up a nation any country on God’s earth ever had will
have drifted away for ever.
♦
“W.S.T.”: lam one of many who would like to
know if there is any probability of the N.S.W.
Resumption of Estates, or Closer Settlement Act,
coming into practical force. The weak point of
the measure is that the State can only buy where
tlie owner offers his land for sale, and as this
would entail the naming of a price far beyond the
existing valuation for land-taxation purposes, it is
not likely many estates will be offered under the
Act. To make this legislation of any value we
should have to adopt the Maoriland system under
which the State chooses what land it requires to
place people on farms. Many would-be cultiva-
tors would then jump at the chance of some of the
rich lands upon the Western slopes of the Blue
Mountains, for there is practically no good land
open for selection in N.S.W. convenient to a
market, or in fact anywhere but in the Great
Western Desert, otherwise the Western Division.

Bland’s “Great Ruby,” at Sydney
Lyceum, is a refreshing detective drama, with no
lost woman in it, but instead a much-mislaid
jewel. The characters spend their time chasing
after that ornament and grouping themselves
around it admiringly. There are the usual society
ladies, in Worth costumes, talking bitterly of
their poverty, and everything happens in the
midst of a high-class cricket match, or a military
tournament, or something equally gorgeous. Even
“ the village street,” which might be excused for
being plain and humble, has a bright and decora-
tive appearance about it. The Ruby goes through
many vicissitudes. It is stolen from the glittering
shop of Sir John Garnett in a rather simple and
sudden manner ; is lost in a chocolace-box, strug-
gled for in a portmanteau (which burst open on
Saturday night when it shouldn’t and put the actors
to shame), and also journeys up in a balloon in com-
pany with a Hindu prince and an English thief
(who escapes from pursuit by this simple process).
It is much desired by Frances Ross, Detective
Bland Holt, and the members of a gang who
concoct deep designs behind newspapers in the
parks. A virtuous woman may be far above
rubies, but she is seldom so much run after. And
unless a balloon with a virtuous woman in it went
to an extraordinary height the proverb was all
wrong anyhow.
» * * *
Mrs. Bland Holt, who suspects all her
friends of not being above stealing jewels, and
does so in a public manner and on small provoca-
tion, acts naturally and without exaggeration.
She is a nice, amiable vulgarian, and when she
discovers that she has called numerous well-
dressed ladies and gentlemen Barabbases with-
out cause, she repents at once, and beseeches
her husband to “ smack her hard.” The scene
blots itself out just then, so that one cannot tell if
the lady was slapped hard or not. There is no
audible slap, anyhow. Miss Frances Ross, as a
well-bred lady thief, wears the costly garments of
this class of sin with grace. She is to be com-
mended for all of them except the yellow robe
that harmonises with the purple room, said robe
being rather long in the tail for all the work she
has to do in it. She walks up and down the
purple room pouring her soul out to Baker, but
has to stop every now and then to bring the
yellow robe to its bearings. Sometimes her maid
wanders in and arranges it for her ; a fine scene
is spoilt by the vagaries of the otherwise
pleasing garment. Baker is a melancholy
Hindu Prince who walks through his
part pleasantly and dies in an agricultural
tournament, mainly because one of the Ruby-
stealers makes derogatory rem arks about Frances
Ross when clinging to another man’s balloon in
the clouds. Bland Holt is necessarily heavier
than usual as a somewhat serious detective ; and
it is to be feared that Miss Harrie Ireland made
some trouble before consenting to take the thank-
less part of an unloved lady- ecretary, on whom
Bland Holt resolves to take pity—after he has
settled about the Ruby. Numerous other charac-
ters wander in and out of the scenes, and if some
of these other characters, also some of the prin-
cipal characters, took the trouble to talk more
distinctly, the audience would feel better satis-
fied.
* * * »
The still-life scenery of this drama is ex-
cellent, especially the glittering shop and the
lounge at Oatland’s Park Hotel. Some exception
must be taken to the scene wherein the balloon
ascends half way to the flies, and numerous clouds
fall down from the top and are pushed, out from
the wings. The clouds are all right so far as they
go, but they don’t go far enough, and the hard
wooden floor spoils the illusion of height. If the
management would sell the tail of Miss Ross’s
dress and buy more clouds with the proceeds, so
that that floor which now appears in the sky could
be disguised, the “Great Ruby” would be an
artistic as well as a financial success.

“ Facing the Music,” after inspiring laugh-

Charles 11. and his dog are now guiding
the destinies of England in their third week at
Sydney Royal. The dog is one of the few stage
animals who seem to know their parts perfectly.
His business is principally to sit on a table —in the
royal apartment from which the stairway opens, so
that the draught may blow direct on the royal
ear—and be ruminated to by the king about the
difficulty of steering the troubled State. The
small dog rises when the king asks his opinion,
and offers his cold nose to Charles by way of
counsel. Then the cares of State burst in
on Charles, and sweep the dog away—at
all events the public loses sight of him in the
rush. He doesn’t take a front place in the drama
after that. Presumably when Charles died he
left the dog to his successor, and doubtless he was
trodden on by the rush of the invading Dutch
army a few years later, and obliterated from
history. Charles apparently was faithful to four
things—three women and a dog. These four lend
a touch of kindliness to the stage character
of the Frisky King. He lobks like a man who
would have carried his pup out of burning London
regardless of risks, even if he had to leave his wife
behind to do it.

The inconsequential Judith still wails over
brother Iscariot at Sydney Criterion, though, it
seems to the writer, not at such length as formerly.
The fact that Barabbas may have been a high-
class, well-dressed robber, as Miss Williamson
depicts him, is just beginning to displace that old
idea of him as a low person who said the Hebrew
for blanky, and belonged to the push that leaned
against Herod the Great’s back fence. Some
traditions give out that Barabbas was in prison
for political offences —that he was one of the
partly patriotic, partly villainous, partly fanatical
and partly mad organisation of the Robbers which
defended Jerusalem with its last tooth against
Titus and his Romans. And the distinction
drawn between the robber who wasn’t executed
and the two thieves who were is worth noting.
Miss Maud Williamson might do worse than
revise Barabbas, aud make him another Wallace
or Bolivar, stating through the keyhole of his
dungeon that Judah will yet be free, and will
grind the skull of Caesar on the 144 steps of the
temple.
** * *
Be “Barabbas” at Sydney Criterion, it
may be casually mentioned that Miss Maud
Williamson, who plays the part of Miss Iscariot,
is a lady who has passed through much theatrical
tribulation. Asa blind heroine, supposed to fall
into the river, she has been suspended in the air
by the invisible wires that ought to have been
cut; she has had her foot pinned to the floor
by the unblunted sword of a stage duellist; and
once she was nearly drowned in a tank, because
the three men sent in to rescue her lost their
heads, and spent the time rescuing one another.
She was brought to with restoratives, and
comforted with a medal. Maud’s second-last
grief was the Plague Scare which helped to spoil
the first part of her Criterion season, and her
very latest sorrow is caused by the new concrete
flooring in the Criterion, which has caused an
epidemic of severe colds ever since the company
has had to stand about the wings in the light,
ancient Judean garments of “Barabbas.” The
coughing of the Criterion company as it waits in
the wings has grown so frequent that if
“Barabbas” remains on the boards much
longer Peter will some evening have to
save the situation by remarking to Judas that
the groans of the early Christians in the adjacent
dungeons are much louder this afternoon. As they
wait about for their turn to go on the members of the
co. read to each other ecclesiastical letters lament-
ing their appearance in religious and desecrating
&, and warning them of the soul-peril to come.
he company buttons its twentieth century
ulster round its first century toga, and dances on
its ancient and sandalled feet to warm them, and
is but little impressed by the threat that it will be
warmer by - and - bye. Peter, who can keep
tolerably warm even on the boards in the large,
voluminous dressing-gown, which seems to have
been the uniform of the first disciples, is much
envied. This is a cold season for a play which is
dressed in sandals and the long pale cotton night-
shirt of classic days.

There was no alteration in the strong

“My Jack,” the latest deliverance at
Melb. Royal, strikes one as having been gathered
together from the wreckage of several bygone
melodramas. There’s a lighthouse and consider-
able rolling sea in the first act ; then somebody
gets murdered on account of missing papers, and
the wrongly-suspected Inman can’t prove his in-
nocence until he is stranded on the old Egyptian
desert together with another thirsty castaway,
who confesses everything in a villainous foreign
accent. The desert hysterics of the parched
foreigner are followed by the discovery of a
missing Flag, which involves the honor of the
British Empire and is produced with brilliant
success from underneath Inman’s shirt, where the
hero has been saving it from the Arabs. It is
only the sort of Flag that a stockbroker waves on
Mafeking Nights under the influence of drink,
but it reflects great credit on Inman and probably
leads to his being made a peer when he has come
into his property and taken over a baronetcy from
H. O. Willard. The trouble about the property
is so very old and mysterious that in a legal-
minded melodrama Inman would stand a poor
show to get any property at all, notwithstanding
the Papers, but “My Jack” is not a
legal-minded drama, though it might be
more wildly insane than it is. A few extra
touches of lunacy would improve the narra ive
rather than otherwise, especially in the fourth
act, where the two men converse together con-
cerning their exhausted condition and other little
matters until the audience would be glad to see
a thu derbolt come down from Heaven and kill
them both. For that matter, a fatal thunderbolt
would be a pleasing novelty in any drama. As a
destructive agent and a thrilling mechanical effect
it has hitherto been overlooked by authors and
managers.
* » » *
Willard, Inman, Bert Bailey, and Miss
Eugenie Duggan are practically the same people
in this case as in a dozen previous cases, where
Willard met with retribution. Temple Harrison
is more seriously wicked than usual, and it doesn’t
suit him. T.H.’s spurious Cockney nasallsm,
which sounds like an abortive attempt to imitate
Bland Holt, grows very trying when it is sup-
posed to express the penitence and despair of a
bloo 1-stained ruffian named Panitza. Several
small characters are well filled in by Geo. Carey,
Walter Rivers and others. If “My Jack” were
not limited to two weeks, The Bulletin would
lodge a particular reproof against the scenic artist
for painting a marquee on the margin of an ocean,
as though it were a canvas bathing-machine.

At Her Majesty’s the “Florodora” re-
vival is a genuine boom as revivals go, and to-
morrow night . (Friday), when Grace Palotta
makes her farewell appearance as the Widow who
“can’t pretend that she doesn’t know things,” the
big house in Exhibition-street will be crowded
more or less. Assisted by sundry new “gags”
and stage arrangements “ Florodora ” goes fas all
the time. Whereas Brownlow used to take the
whole stage to himself when he was slowly asking
an invisible Dolores to meet him under the palms,
his successor, Harold Thorley, addresses the same
song to the lady in person, which is a
rational way of making an appointment.
Also, he warbles with comparative briskness, so
the difference between Brownlow and Thorley is
not always deplored. Some tableaux of a Jingo
illustrated-newspaper character were hitched on
to the entertainment last Saturday night, but this
scribe did not stay to see “Britannia and her
Daughters,” or the representations of Britain’s
Friendship, Justice, and Love in Boerland, or
the spectacle of King Edward Ban took and Queen

The first performance of “A Chinese
Honeymoon,” at Melbourne Princess’s on Mon-
day night, showed a piece very promising in some
places and very weak in others. It lasted for
three and a-half hours, and kept the prompter
always on the alert. The play is so full of easy
opportunities for improvement, and so likely to
lead to alterations in the cast before the week is
out, that The Bulletin will defer judgment till
next issue. “A Chinese Honeymoon ” seems
to have drawn its ideas from “The Mikado”
and “The Geisha,” and in some of its. hap-
piest moments the suggestion of Gilbert and
Sullivan is decidedly clever. Probably Gilbert
could convert it into a sparkling little operatic
comedy without much trouble, but if that bilious
expert were to take control of Musgrove’s patchy
production, he would start proceedings by en-
gaging new artists for at least three of the parts.
On Monday night Miss May Beatty saved the
situation frequently by her high-spirited perform-
ance of a “ low comedy” girl. May Beatty has
only a crude conception of Cockney character, but
her vigor, good humor and intelligence enabled
her to get away with the honors in this case.
For the rest Edward Lauri was not so successful
as he presently will be. Baritone Piddock sang
and whistled sweetly, and cut rather a serious
figure in an unthankful part as the lover of Miss
Josephine Stanton. Miss Cissie Niel made
a feeble first appearance, and tuneful Henry
Hallam showed a lack of detail in his act-
ing as the Emperor of China. Other people
were not too satisfactory, but they got little
chance to score until the clock had struck 11 and
matters were being hurried. The strength of “ A
Chinese Honeymoon ” lies in the second act, and
as all previous shows of the same class, except
“ Florodora,” have been weak where this is strong,
the management should make a desperate .effort to
remedy the first-night defects ; the thing is worth
a desperate effort.

At the Opera House the latest arrivals are
two Brothers —a plain, gymnastic brother and a
monkeyfied ditto—who perform on horizontal
bars, and bound upwards from an elastic table
without striking any new ideas to speak of.
The Concertina King has played himself into the
affections of a generous public, and the Nawns are
appearing in a new sketch. Tom Nawn goes
to sleep and dreams the dream of a broguey Irish-
man who has raised a spook in much the same
way that Petramos Dunn brought Niobe to life.
Nawn’s dream introduces beer and domestic diffi-
culties. Also it introduces Miss Katherine Nawn,
a young lady who takes after Mrs. Nawn as
regards the pain in her voice. “Pat and the
Genie ” is a pleasant little joke that will show to
more advantage when the Sidney Drews have
gone away. The Drews, and their dawg, likewise
the oppressed inaid-servant and her miserable hat
are leaving the Opera House this week.

George Musgrove seems to have definitely
fixed a £1 maximum charge for the Melba con-
certs—£l, 10s., and ss. This disposes of the
rumor that Melba was likely to make her appear-
ances in Melbourne at the Princess’s Theatre.
The Town Hall or the Exhibition Building will
be the place. Prob ibly she will be heard for the
first time under the dome at the Exhib., in which
case the “house” ought to be worth £5OOO at
least. Sept. 24th is to be the date of the event.

Donald Macdonald’s beautiful calm
audacity is not the least of his qualifications for
public lecturing. At Melb. Athenaeum t’other
night Mac took the platform as per advt. to
discourse on “War and Peace” in aid of the
Women Writers’ Club. There was a well-crowded
house, about 90 per cent, of the audience being old
admirers of the journalist in kharkee, who had come
expecting to hear something quite new and up-to-
date concerning the subjects mentioned in the
ad. Mac’s latest entertainment, however, proved
to be mainly a selection of items from his
original Ladysmith yarn. When he had
talked for about 40min. he called for some
pictures of English buildings and places
historic and otherwise to be put upon the screen,
and these represented the “Peace” portion of
his lecture. Then came lOmin. interval, after
which Mac. went on with some more of his
S’African experiences. The fact that they were
worth hearing once again testifies to the merit of
the raconteur and his reminiscent matter; but
what chiefly impressed one was his unassuming
“front.” Only a born showman could casually
introduce a series of irrelevant limelight views
into the middle of a well-worn War lecture and
call them “Peace.” Donald Mac. will make an
effective M.P one of these days if he yields to
the awful temptation.

English papers have been publishing as a
recent item of news the old, old story that “an
Australian manager” (who is, of course, the
irrepressible Dan Barry) hitches the names of
deceased notorieties—Rev. Spurgeon, Parnell and
W. E. Gladstone —to three of the melodramas
which he produces. A Bulletin correspondent
wants to know “ In what backblock townships are
these fabrications practised?” Well, Geelong was
not so many years ago stirred to its religious core
by Dan’s audacious presentment of “ The Parson’s
Oath, by Rev. C. H. Spurgeon,” and Dan did very
well out of it. A local clergyman, Rev. Webb,
(he died quite recently), wrote to the Geelong
papers protesting that his distinguished brother-
in-the-Lord could never have been guilty of
writing any drama for the stage, much less “The
Parson’s Oath.” The result of Rev. Webb’s in-
dignation was crowded houses for Dan Barry, who
used to come before the curtain with a roll of
paper in his hand and invite anyone in the
audience to step forward and examine The
Contract, signed by Mr. Spurgeon’s son.” No-
body in the gentle Geelong crowd ventured upon
the stage to examine Dan’s bluffsome document,
so the “drama by Spurgeon” was accepted on its
producer’s pretensions. All the same the Rev. Webb
remained sceptical. At the end of a phenomenally
-successful season he sought out Dan and said
“Sir, I am unable to believe that your play was
really written by Mr. Spurgeon.” Dan dug the
good' man in the ribs and replied, “I know it
wasn’t, and so do you.” “ Then,” said the shep-
herd, “ I regret, I deeply regret having written
my letter to the press, for I fear it served to
attract people to the theatre, even members of
my own congregation.” “Fell in ! chirped
Daniel Barry. His Rev. friend gazed upon him
with a sad twinkle in his eye, and murmured
“ Yes, indeed—indeed— they fell in”
At Adelaide Royal, the Waldorf season
ended with a few nights of “The Royal Divorce,”
which took the place of several contemplated
revivals. H. H. Vincent scored a success as
Napoleon. The general feeling of the public
seems to be one of surprise at the advertising of
one lady as a star, and the other members of the
co. merely as support, whereas the others turn out
to be a very strong all-round crowd. The No. 2
Comics have returned from the West, reviving
“ A Runaway Girl ” and “ Belle of New York.”
Brownlow (who had a large farewell concert at
the Town Hall) dropped out, and Arthur Crane
(late baritone at the Tivoli) dropped in. “The
Wrong Mr. Wright” filled the little Tivoli for
three solid weeks, but has at last given way to
Smith and the Cook-Ladies’ Union.

Walter James, whose accession to the Wes-

Australasia has had such an appalling number of

the front earliest ; but Boucaut, of S.A., who
arrived at the age of 35, and Vogel, Byrnes, and
James at 38 were among the youngest.

a picturesque lakelet, fringed with reeds—a

The unexpected acceptance by Edmund
Barton of a knighthood strengthens the public
belief that the Prime Minister will shortly retire
from the Ministry to the Federal High Court. It
is no secret that Barton is poor enough to look
askance at the added responsibility of keeping up
a title on the uncertain income of a politician. A
P.C.-ship, and now a G.C.M G.-ship, are as much
as he is likely to secure from the hurly-burly of
politics, and he will indeed be a foolish man not
to shortly provide a more stable position for him-
self than the Prime Minister’s chair.
What has become of the ukase issued a

and thence to G.C.M.G. ? The coronation list of
honors has shown that this scheme has been
abandoned. And the pity of it ! Had Premier
See and others had to start as plain Companions
of the Order they would not have accepted the
“distinction,” and extinction of the whole crowd
of grand crosses and knights might have followed
in time.
There is" just now a very strong anti-im-

was put by ex-Minister G. A. Nantel in a recent
speech :
Canada does not find itself in the same position as the
other great colonies which are isolated, such as S. Africa
and Australia. She dwells in the midst of a powerful
world, I may say from many points more puissant than
Great Britain herself— the American world. Is it reason-
able that if we renounce the formation of an independent
nation, a Canadian Empire by ourselves, we will go and
precipitate ourselves into the whirlpool of pan-Britannism,
instead of marching with a neighbor as rich and for that
matter as liberal and as generous as our suzerain, who
lives 3000 miles away from us, and under conditions of
existence to which we are strangers, when they are not
directly opposed and hostile to our proper means of
existence ? If Canada must live by Imperialism of some
kind, let us speak of American Imperialism, and not o
British Imperialism ; let us have nothing to say of that.
N.S.W. Public Service Gazette, dealing
with the appeals of 832 public officers, dating
from Ist January, 1901, was published on June 27,
two days before the vote lapsed, and there was a
great scatter to pay the long-deferred increments
before the Treasury closed down on the financial
year on June 30. Only 163 (or a bare fifth of those
who appealed) received anything at all, and most
of these but small advancements of £5 and
£lO a year. Owing to the absurdly small, sum
that the P.S.B. requested Parliament to vote to
satisfy the just demands of officers dissatisfied
with their last grading, the Board could not have
done otherwise. But to the great number of
appellants who were met with the remark, that
the Board had not enough money to go round, the
knowledge that they were refused on this ground
was extremely galling.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Sydney Morning Herald (25/6/’O2) again
preaches to Australia the Freetrade paper’s favorite doc-
trine of cowardice and helplessness, thus:—“ The
Treasurer is often told that he should pay for all his new
works out of revenue. This might be possible if he could
save up for the purpose. The Constitution, however,
prevents this, and he cannot have a surplus even of one
penny.” Moral, of course: The Federal Government
must borrow. The anxiety of the Sydney dailies to prove
that the Federal Government must borrow is something
pathetic. And yet, strange as it may seem in the case of
such a solemnly respectable paper as the Herald, the
above yarn is utterly and absolutely false—a poor, bald,
unconvincing tarradiddle invented in support of the doc-
trine of cowardice and helplessness. The Federal
Government can retain one-fourth of the customs and
excise revenue, and so far as that goes it can pay
for public works out of revenue. It can levy any other
taxes it pleases, and retain all of them, and pay for public
works out of the proceeds. It has the same power of
paying for works out of revenue as any other Govern-
ment has. As for the theory that the Constitution
doesn’t allow the Federal Treasurer to have a penny sur-
plus, he doesn’t want a penny surplus. He only wants
enough to pay his legitimate outgoings, which are the
cost of Federal Government in its various branches,
public works expenditure, and, when the Commonwealth
takes over the State debts, provision for interest and
sinking fund thereon. Any surplus would be as useless
to him as five legs to a hen. But if the Herald means to
say that he can’t pay for public works, except out of a
surplus, it might as well say that he can’t pay the
Governor-General’s salary except out of a surplus. In a
well-ordered State public works expenditure is as much
a part of the regular expenditure as anything else. In
England, for instance, public works are as distinctly a
regular charge on the revenue as the wages of the Civil
Service—but perhaps the S.M. Herald never heard of
England. If that paper of weak apologies and helpless
remarks about the impossibility of things had only a
tenth of the English grit and honesty in financial affairs,
instead of being English in its war policy 7 and a sort of
flabby, half-bred dish-cloth in public money matters, it
would teach a much more valuable lesson. The gospel of
put-it-off and give-it-up and let-it-slide is the Herald’s
special gospel, and it is as undermining as drink, and as
demoralising as the habit of being dead.
• • • »
There is one point which the anti-loan party in
the Federal Parliament needs to keep in mind if it is
going to be of any use whatever as a party 7. The country
needs public works—it is impossible to have civilisation
without them. Therefore, it is no earthly good refusing
to borrow for public works unless the party is willing to
find the money for them otherwise. It is essential to
have a separate Public Works Fund, into which the pro-
ceeds of certain taxes, services, or steals—into which
some reliable revenues of our own—will be paid, so that
works can go on, and the anti-loan party should demand
that such sources of revenue be provided and so applied.
Every attempt at economy in loans so far has merely con-
sisted in leaving necessary works undone and existing
works unrepaired, and when the public grew tired of
leaving things in that state the big loans commenced
again. They always will commence again under like
conditions, for the country can’t fall back on aboriginal
principles. Nothing can be effected by relying on the
surplus—this country never has a surplus.

The Maoriland Government Life Insurance Department
has now an accumulated life fund of £3,285,416. Out of
the various sums set apart at different times to provide
for depreciation, there remains £36,297 at credit of in-
vestment fluctuation reserve. Likewise there is £5228 at
credit of the Tontine Savings Fund, but this is kept
separate from the general fund till the tontine matures,
bo it is not included in the above.
The Department still keeps far ahead, in point
of business in force, of all competitors in its own State.
Also it is still the most cheaply managed of Australasian
offices, the A.M.P. only excepted, and among offices of
anything like its own size and age, it is the cheapest bar
none. The expense rate during the last nine years has
been as follows:
Expenses in Proportion to Total Income.
1893 £l4 19 0 per cent. 1898 £l4 6 10 per cent,
1894 15 1 7 „ 1899 14 2 11 „
1895 13 1 5 „ 1900 14 10 0 „
1896 13 18 7 „ 1901 12 16 11 „
1897 14 17 2 „
This year’s expense rate has dropped with unusual sud-
denness through the transference of the funds of No. 1
Tontine, now matured, to the general fund.
There is, as usual, a slight drop in interest
earnings. There is a slight drop in interest earnings
with all assurance institutions nowaday's, and wheie the
process will end it is not easy to say, though there are
hopes that the worst is over. The record of the Maori-
land Government Life Insurance Department is as
follows :
, Rate on average amount
Interest earned. of Asauranc | Fund .
1893 .. £108,098 £5 5 2 percent.
1894 115,270 5 5 0 „
1895 .. 119,973 5 2 3 „
1896 .. 124,255 4 19 0 „
1897 .. 128,424 4 16 7 „
1898 .. 131,188 4 13 11 „
1899 .. 133,466 4 11 1 „
1900 .. 136,955 4 9 3 „
1901 .. 142,449 4 8 8 „
The drop this year doesn’t amount to very much, and it
begins to seem probable that the fall in interest earnings
is nearly over, for the time at all events. In every 7
respect the Maoriland Government Life Insurance De-
partment continues its career of prosperity, and, con-
sidering the exceeding smallness of the community 7 to
which its business is confined, its progress is something
altog ;t her unusual. Its assets look solid • beyond
the average. They include no spectral or dubious
items such as ‘ ‘ Deferred Instalments of Annual
Premiums,” or the like. Out of over £3.000,000 of assets,
foreclosed properties represent the infinitesimal sum of
£5152, and overdue interest is only £472. Both these
items speak well for the safety of the investments—when
interest is difficult to collect and the mortgagors largely
develop the habit of abandoning th’eir properties to the
society, it is evidence, on the .other hand, of grievous in-
security in the assets. Taking everything into account,
the Maoriland Government Life Insurance Department is
more absolutely free of points to which objection can be
taken than any other Australasian office in its line of
business.

Officially announced that the public debt of
N.S.W. is now £71,044,734 but this does not include the
amounts still due to the property-holders in the resumed
area, so N.S.W. probably owes £75,000,000 or a little over
in one way and another. The day when the debt reaches
£100,000,000 should be declared a public holiday.

One notable point about the Audit Bill, now
before N.S.W. Assembly, is that it gives the Auditor-
General power to audit and report on the loan accounts.
Hitherto, astounding as it may seem, the loan expendi-
ture has never been audited. This is almost as astound-
ing as the fact that in no Australasian State is there any
law defining what works may be charged to loans and
what may not.

Maoriland grew 13,000,000 bushels of wheat in
18S9 ; this year it has grown 4,000,000, a diminution of
9,000,000 bushels (in Australia the decline was only
3,000,000 bushels). And for this contirigenting is largely
responsible, for there was no drought in Maoriland as in
Australia. Seddon’s blood-drunk islands sent a larger
proportion of their population farm-burning than
any other State, and its incendiaries were mostly taken
away from the plough, and the plough stood still in their
absence. And Maoriland gets no British grant, as the
Boers do, to repair its farms.

The Bulletin has before it a circular purport-
ing to be issued by the City Mutual Life Assurance
Society (Sydney), in which it compares its bonuses and
results with those of the A.M.P. Society, and shouts con-
siderably over the results. It states that an A.M.P.
policy for £lOOO issued at age 30 cost £24 Is. Bd. a year
premium, and the bonuses for 1899-1900-1901 were £4B, or
£l6 a year. And it goes on to state that the City
Mutual charged only £23 10s. lOd. per year for £lOOO at
age 30, and in these same years gave bonuses amounting
to £93 6s. Bd., equal to £3l 2s. 2d. per year. This means
that the City Mutual charged 10s. lOd. less premium and
§ave £l5 a year more bonus. And if, in each case, the
onus went on at this rate for life, the City Mutual would
have some right to whoop. But whereas the £24 Is. Bd. is
the rate charged by the A.M.P. on an ordinary whole life
policy whereon, bar unforeseen accidents, the bonuses
may go on at this rate for life, the City Mutual’s charge
of £23 10s. lOd. seems to be for a special policy (Table F.)
on which an annual bonus of £3 per cent, is guaranteed
for three years only. —After that period it takes its chance
with the rest. The City Mutual’s ordinary whole life
policies apparently received £3 per cent, for the three
years ended 1894 (say, £lO a year on a £lOOO policy) ; £2
per cent, for the three years to 1897 (say, £6 13s. 4d. per
year on £1000); £1 for the three years to 1900 (say,
£3 6s. Bd. per year on £1000). Moreover, the City Mutual
seems to have given up issuing this sensational policy It
doesn’t appear at all in the latest table of rates
that writer has seen. There is a lamentable
want of candour about a document which allows the
public to infer that the bonus of £3O a year for a premium
of £23 10s. lOd is, or is likely to be, a regular thing, and
that its ordinary policies are built on these lines, or any-
thing dimly resembling them. An office which, in 1901,
had a surplus of only £9766 to divide among it policy-
holders as the result of three years’ work, isn’t con-
structed that way.

It is reported that Melbourne Board of Works,
which looks after the water and sewerage business of
Fitzgibbon’s city, reckons that its revenue for next year
will be £477,402, and expenditure £859,705, Jeaving a
shortage of £382,303 to be made good by loan. Even
allowing for the fact that the Melbourne Board of Sewers
and Shirks is still spending money on construction, its
affairs are drifting into a shocking state, and increased
taxation, or bankruptcy, or an appeal to the Govern-
ment to come to the rescue, after the fashion of
Sydney in bygone years, begins to loom among
the events of the near future. Melbourne’s water-
rate is 6d. in the £, and it has a splendid supply—
miles ahead of the average Euglish city. This country
always expects to get the best of everything for the
lowest charge. In Great Britain, Aberdeen pays BJd.
in the £ for water; Aberystwith, 2s. ; Ayr, lOd. ;
Bacup, Is. to Is. 6d. ; Barrow, Is. ; Bedford, 9d. ;
Belfast, Is. ; Birmingham, about Is. 2d. and baths
extra ; Blackburn, Is. 7d.; Bolton, about Is. 6d.; Bootle,
Is. lid. ; Bradford, Is. 6d., baths extra; Burnley, Is. ;
Gloucester, lOd. ; Huddersfield, about Is. 6d.; Liverpool,
Is. lid.; Manchester, 9d., baths extra, and increased rate
in the suburbs ; Macclesfield, Is. to Is. 4|d. ; Northamp-
ton, Is. to Is. 6d. ; Sheffield, about Is. 2d., baths and
water-closets both charged extra; Wolverhampton, Is.
3d. in the £, and so on. Where the rates are as low as in
Melbourne it is generally because, by a long course of
high rates, the debt has been greatly reduced or almost
extinguished, and a period of relief is setting in. In some
British towns, the rate, including all extras, runs to more
than 2s. in the £ for water alone. But in all these places
the debt incurred for waterworks is being paid off in a
large, solid way, and, some day, there will be no debt and
a rate of about 3d. The Australian idea of getting a fine
large supply, charging the lowest possible rate, never pay-
ing off the original debt, but adding to it by deficits, and
then asking the State for aid out of loans doesn’t find
favor in Great Britain.
Why municipal government is a comparative
and often a superlative failure in Australia—a debt-laden,
embarrassed, insolvent thing that is always waylaying the
passing Premier for aid, and holding out the low-spirited
hat for a dole, and why it isn’t in that state in England,
can be understood by consideration of the rates charged
in large English towns :

On a very long list there is only one town whose rates are
below 4s. in the £, and its bill is 3s. lOd. And in most
cases water rates are an extra, and come on top of these
charges. An Australian corporation which proposed to
keep solvent at half the figure which is quite common
in England, would be disembowelled by the ratepayers.
Helped by Commonwealth protection and open
interstate markets, South Australia has started to build
up what promises to be a very substantial salt industry.
One co., the Castle Salt, after a four years’ struggle, made
a gross profit last year (to May 9) of £6048 ; but £2OOO is
written off for depreciation—nothing hitherto had been
done in that respect, although the wear and tear on a
salt plant is very heavy. So far, the plant has cost the
co. over £12,000. Last year’s output was 33,600 tons, an
increase of 8500 tons on the previous years. The other
bigS.A. co. is the Federal Salt, which, during May and
the first fortnight of June, gathered 1000 tons, and ex-
pects to shortly treble this. These co’s work between
them a large number of shallow lakes on Yorke’s Penin-
sula and the West Coast.

White Cliffs opal field is just now, The Bul-
letin hears, experiencing a rough time. The water-
supply has given out, and Govt, is employing all avail-
able teams to cart water some seven or eight miles. The
water, which is to be supplied to the public at 3s. Od. per
lOOgals., is said to be bad. The local opal market is
lower now than ever. First-quality gems always realise
a good price, but poor and medium quality stuff is almost
valueless. Opal, which a few months ago sold readily at
£1 and 30s. per oz. is scarcely saleable at ss. Of course
the miner is completely at the mercy of the buyers, and
is practically forced to sell at their prices. The whole
township presents an appearance of utter dejection,
weariness, and thirst. Also, White Cliffs suffers from the
“ Yellow Curse.” There are three bakers on the field,
two of w'hom are Chows. Out of eight stores two are
run by Celestials, two by Syrians, and one by an Afghan.
This, too, in a community that howls itself thirsty for
Unionism and a White Australia. Nathless, the
foreigners thrive on the fact that Labor-Union communi-
ties at large are so often ready to sacrifice their boasted
principles where cash is concerned, and the smug Chow
or Oriental can usually undercut the European store-
keeper by 7 a penny or two.

By what, of course, was simply a coincidence,
Melb. papers, the other day, simultaneously published
details of a new solution of the B.H. sulphide problem.
Next day the Sulphide Corporation, which was reported
to have the process in hand, desired it said that nothing
conclusive had yet been reached as to either extraction or
costs. The process (the Sulman-Pickard) was chosen by
the co.’s metallurgist in Europe, where it was said to be
getting out 80 per cent, of the zinc, and leaving the
residue a smelting silver-lead ore. Now, this has for
years past been regarded as the ideal way of going
about the business. Schnabel, the Freiberg pro-
fessor, whom the Barrier co.’s imported 10 _ years
ago, therefore devoted his chief experiments
to the preliminary solving-out of the zinc. He could do
it in several ways ; but he could not make it pay anyhow.
In ’95, T. J. Greenwa.v, who was advising Block 14 and
the South, reported to the same effect. The sulphides
are a silver-lead ore, containing about 20 per cent, zinc
and much sulphur. Together or separately, the sulphur
and the zinc prevent a treatment by smelting. The
sulphur can be got rid of by roasting ; there are several
methods of doing it —the co’s are still experimenting, with
a view to finding out the cheapest. The sulphur gone,
the zinc still remains. The ordinary process ot zinc (or
spelter) manufacture is by distillation f that is, the ore,
mixed with coal or coke, is brought to a white heat in
small retorts and the zinc vapor is caught in con-
densers. If, however, there is much lead in the ore it
rapidly destroys the retorts, and this bars the process by
making it too expensive ; also, there is a considerable
loss of silver and lead, which go off in vapor with the
zinc, and don’t do the zinc any good. The alleged feature
of the new process is the use of a soft, caking bituminous
coal in the retorts ; this is stated to hold the silver and
lead in the pores while the zinc flies off. What is left in
the retorts, it is claimed, is a good smelting silver-lead
ore, surrounded by almost enough coke to smelt itself. It
is a very simple variation indeed from the well-known
methods ; and if it makes much difference will surprise
people who ought to know—that is, assuming that all the
leading features of the process have been stated.
It is quite possible that, with a little help, zinc-
production may be successfully begun at Broken Hill.
First of all, there is the stuff already on the surface along-
side the rails—hundreds of thousands of tons of it, and
already crushed fine. Every year about 500,000 tons are
produced, containing from 5 to 6oz. silver, 5 per cent,
lead, and 15 per cent, zinc; some richer, some poorer,
but varying less than the original ore did. This is not
only raised, then, but the first process, the crushing, is
done. The inevitable second process must be to get rid
of the sulphur. The Sulphide Corporation is trying the
Heberlein process; the Carmichael process, a Broken Hill
discovery, is claimed to be a step ahead of that. By this
the sulphur driven off can be converted into sulphurous
or sulphuric acid ; and either of these will solve the zinc,
which must be the third process. If it can be done to
pay has yet to be proved by any of the B.H. co’s., which,
so far, have been trying to get rid of the sulphur by
heap-roasting, partly, no doubt, because they can do that
without paying royalty or putting money into experi-
mental plant. They do not, however, save the sulphur
by this method. The great importance of a process for
getting out the zinc lies in the fact that, not only is
spelter very valuable (it is nearly always £3 or £4 better
than lead), but if it is out of the ore about 45 or 50 per cent,
more silver and from 20 to 25 per cent, more lead can be
recovered. If it were not for the latter fact the co.’s here
would hardly trouble much about the zinc, because, on
account of the high cost of recovery (mainly for labor and
fuel) there is no prospect of dazzling profits.

At time of writing N.S.W. Mines Secretaryship
not decided. Office has been vacant for some weeks.
Fierce competition for the billet in and out of the depart-
ment, and much bitterness within. _ Mysterious outsider
said to be well in the running. Can it be an M.P. ? Mines
Department is the one in which political influence and
control are most largely exercised, and the Secretary is
nothing more than a routine recording official. It would
be casting an unmerited slur on the tribe of officials to
assume that not one of their number is equal to the
billet. It is a simple job for the trained red-tape man :
“ Obey orders, think in as many languages as you like,

Bee Mountain, a few miles south of Cobar, is
the locale of the latest find in that highly-metalliferous
district. A lode rich in copper, gold, and silver is said to
have been found. Reports necessarily very much exag-
gerated; if they are one-third true the show is good
enough. The mountain was a veritable hive of industry
for a few hours. The nondescripts of Cobar were there
in hundreds, working like Trojans—putting in pegs.
Several “ smart ” Sydney men, scenting another Cobar
boom, journeyed to the place, only to find the country-
side for miles dotted with posts and “ applied-for-lease ”
notices —mostly bogus. Catch a weasel asleep when you
get ahead of a Cobar man ! Concentrate next week and

prospectively-good lease-pegging on your own account,

Eleanora mine, Hill grove (N.S.W.), sold in
Adelaide for £650. The plant on the ground is worth
more than that, if only as scrap-iron. Eleanora cost
Sydney and Adelaide speculators many thousands, and
worst of all, it killed a good man —Northern Territory
Griffith. Doctors certified death as from typhoid—
friends knew that it was Eleanora worry. Mine under
Adelaide control paid two 6d. divs., earned from the
treatment of old tailings in “Junction” Jolly’s time.
With the disappearance of this source of profit Jolly was
cute enough tol quit. ” Sharpe (his successor) tooted the
trumpet most vigorously in proclamation of the wonders
which he was going to perform. Now he is enjoying the
consolation which comes to the good manager, who
assumes that he can make a success of a bad mine.
Eleanora may be tried again, but not until fools with
whips of money to throw away are more plentiful than at
present. Antimony and gold-patchiness are the draw-
backs. If there were less, or more, antimony in the mins
it might be less of an anti-money proposition.

Cobar Chesney : Alleged that another offer has
been made for this mine, and shares jumped from nil to
2s. No official intimation —for the simple reason that
there is nothing uncommon to report. Fact is that,
perhaps, for the hundredth time, directors have been
asked at what figure they will sell the mine. Every mme-
owner within cooee of Oobar is being pestered with a
similar question from all sorts and conditions of people.
The legion of commission touts in Sydney, assuming that
the Great Oobar deal is as good as completed, are working
their wits to get the right to dispose of other mines on
the field, without which, of course, Great Cobar will be
comparatively small potatoes. If the big mine be pur-
chased, and the new men decide that Chesney will be >
desirable property to acquire, they will not need to
trouble the commission hunters—they will get the mine
in their own way, on their own terms, and at their own
time.

Bellevue Consols, Mt. Samuel (W.A.), now
under charge of manager Cantley (a new man), is over-
hauling the roasting furnace, preparatory to treating
accumulated tailings, assaying 5 per cent, copper and
4£dwt. gold. To date, mill has treated_ 38,000 tons for
41,0000 z., and with the new 40-head mill, now on the
way, monthly tonnage should reach close on 6000 tons.
Developments are very backward for a 3-year-old mine,
but are being pushed on, and as £30,000 cash will be
available clear of the battery, the co. should soon be in a
good position. Co. lately acquired Yellow Aster, at
Kathleen Valley, with 10-head mill. On this block there
is abundance of 12dwt. stone in sight

Latest advices from Merton’s Reward state that
the lode, which seemed to be all over the shop at the
surface, is becoming more defined, but narrowing with
depth. Unfortunately there is a distinct falling-off in
in quality, and gold is no longer visible. Manager
Morgan, who was Callahan’s lieut. on L.V. Consols in the
boom days of ’99, is in charge, and preparing the property
for London market. Co. is already registered there, but
not yet floated. Battery will start almost immediately,
but will be hampered by scarcity of water. Of course, it
will treat nothing other than average stone —Kaufman
will see to that.

Electricity in mining is being more extensively
adopted every day. The Austral Otis Engineering Com-
pany, of South Melbourne, the Australian representatives
of Ganz and Co., have just installed at the Great
Southern Consols mine, Rutherglen, a complete plant for
the underground haulage, doing away with the old costly
system of trucking. The work is now done by electric
locomotives at a much reduced cost; the whole of the
drives and surface works are also lighted from the same
installation. This company has also supplied electric
pumping plants to the Sons of Gwalia mine, and probably
the largest electric pumps in the world for the Charlotte
Plains and New Havilah mines at Maldon. Having
secured the services of a well-known European expert,
they are now prepared to advise, and contract for any
electrical service such as lighting, pumping, haulage,
traction, rock drilling, or the generation and transmission
of power by the latest and most approved methods, and

Appendicitis, from which the well-plucked
King Edward is happily recovering, is, and has
for some tune been, a very fashionable disease,
r iiteen years ago it was practically unknown :
nowadays you 11 see an appendicitis joke in every
American comic paper, and there is a New York
club a condition of admittance to which is that
you ve been operated on for this complaint.
X here is more tuan a suspicion in the public mind
that there are more appendicitis operations than
appendicitis cases. Of course the public may not
be right. The King seems to be pulling round
quickly, and is now allowed to smoke—which is
strongly-reassuring news, both as regards the
condition of his digestion and of his heart.
* * * •
Apparently the crowd which hedges tiie
Throne tries to work the fiction that the King can
sutter no ill just as strenuously as the other fiction
that he can do no wrong. That H.M’s illness a
week before Coronation was serious was
shown by the sudden jump in insurance rates
from 4 to 21 per cent. ; but it was said to
be merely a slight attack of lumbago. News of
the seizure on Saturday, culminating in a fit, was
carefully suppressed. It was only when the
Coronation became impossible—when, in fact, but
for the operation, the King would soon have died—
that the truth was allowed to transpire. Even
now who knows whether we have got the whole
truth ?
A TEST QUESTION.
“Oh, yes, she's pretty, and knows a lot, but she
doesn't know everything
“ Does she know she's pretty? ”
Somewhat remarkable that both King
Edward and his elder sister, who died last year,
should have been stricken down prior to the
“grand climacteric” age of 63, after passing
through the fifties. It begins to look as though
none of Queen Victoria’s children inherited her
splendid constitution. They are not maintain-
ing her family tradition for longevity. George I.
was 67 when he died, George 11. was 77, grandson
George 111. was 82, and his sons, George IV. and
William IV.. were 68 and 72 respectively. They
drank port wine and took any amount of snuff,
but they didn’t smoke big, green cigars like King
Edward and his brother, the late Duke of Edin-
burgh.
* • • *
On Coronation Day the clergy in general
doctored their sermons round from the day of
feasting to the day of mourning, which was fitting
enough, and better, according to “the wisest man
that ever lived.” Now, whatever the Bible is, it is
not a Snob. It strips the King of all his trap-
pings. Its spirit is _ that of Carlyle when he
paints the King facing the void immensity.
Therefore, no preacher can give the Bible
away on this point. But how lamentably
the«e preachers do give themselves away ! The
bulk of them seemed to depict King Edward sis
ready to march, in his coronation robes, from one
drawing-room to another, from Westminster
Abbey into the empyrean! Pastor Fitchett
appears to be almost, the only clergyman reported
who dared, in explicit terms, to transfer Majesty
from Westminster to the surgeon’s table. Not
one preacher of the whole lot was faithful in pre-
senting the Almighty’s view of kingship. As is
shown in.the “ New Book of Kings,” the Almighty
believes in a Republic, but only concedes kings to
human weakness. When the Israelites demand a
king, they are told by Samuel that they are fools,
and all the tyranny the king will practise on them
(exactly as monarchs have done) is pointed out.
Where’s all this in the Australian preachers ?
* * * *
The true character of “ loyal ” official
“rejoicings” was shown in the fact that the men
who spend public money upon illuminations and
things in Australia (and elsewhere) were prepared
to perpetrate the Coronation shivoo even when
they knew the crowning was “ off,” and the Kin r
lay in the shadow of death. They had blewed
much cash and made a lot of arrangements for
pretending to be glad on their Sovereign Lord’s
account, so they were not prepared to substitute a
cup of sorrow for a quart of champagne at a
moment’s notice.

The saddest holiday Sydney ever saw in
its life was that Coronation Day when there
was no Coronation. The few decorations—there
were very few at best—were dead. The shops
were mostly open, but doing no business. There
were prayers for the King’s recovery instead of
joy and drink and whoop. The people who had
arranged special functions had unsold food and
countermanded fowls left on their hands. The
children who had bought crackers either howled
because they had lost their firework display, or
else let them off in defiance, and were accused of
being glad that the King was i 1. .Flags were
dead stock. Country people who had “ come
down to see the Coronation ” —the country people
all talked as if the event were going to happen
locally—dragged “the missus” and “the kids”
aimlessly up and -down the streets. Barbers,
as they shaved people, talked drearily about
abscesses, or brought out and showed to
their customers that dreadful picture of bowels
which appeared in the evening paper. It was
“Hamlet” with everything left out except the
second grave-digger and the charge at the door.
It suggested a second-hand Sunday, or a birthday
feast without the guest or the victuals. Tie
weather was cold as the Private Secretary’s
feet, and grey and drizzly besides, and every-
thing was grey, like the weather, except the
public nose, which was blue, and the public
mackintosh, which was mostly a cheap, black
affair that had faded to green. The restaurant-
keepers, who had made preparations for an un-
usual multitude, reflected sorrowfully on the
unsold corned beef in the twilight. Almost
everything shut up early and went home to bed
in low spirits. But Premier John See’s new title
arrived through the gloom and the drizzle, so one
heart at least was glad, and there was joy in one
produce-store at all events.

There was a wild and woolly time
amongst the Melbourne unemployed and
the wharf-rats and Yarra-bank troglo-
dytes when beer and champagne were
distributed freely to the push and its
wives and aunts for the honor and
glory of King Ned. A brewing eo. pro-
vided six barrels of beer, and these
were tapped in a lane alongside
labor - leader Fleming’s boot shop.
The thirsty destitute were expected to
provide themselves with drinking uten-
sils, and they went, armed with cups, glasses,
' mugs, bottles, jam-tins, pannikins, billies, jugs,
and tea and coffee pots. One lady enthusiast
with a large thirst and great foresight even carried
a kerosene-tin. The police formed the applicants
into line, and marched them past the barrels, each
gettinfea pint as he or she toed scratch. Then
the refreshed ones made a mad break down the
lane and around the block, and chipped in at the
tail of the procession again. This march was
sustained till there was an endless chain of
boisterous drunks rotating round that block, and
then the beer-seekers began to despise order.
By then the legitimate unemployed were right
out of it, and the draggle-tailed Totties and the
wharf-rats and chronic sots were in full possession.
It simply rained beer in that lane. The drunks
waded in it and filled themselves beyond their
test register. The lady who had clung to her
kerosene-tin was now rewarded, and got away
with it three-parts full. When the confusion was
at its highest the police charged, re-captured the
barrels, took possession of the lane, and cut off
supplies, and the loyal demonstration was at an
end. There has not been so indecent a display of
loyalty in Melbourne since the Duke was there.
Fleming distributed 112 quart bottles of Lord
Hopetoun’s champagne at the same time, but this
was done with better judgment, and the wine got
into the hands of the legitimate unemployed.
Fleming argued that it did not necessarily require

MELLOW FRIEND : “ Come, come, old fellow, never let the pubs,

a pampered stomach to appreciate champagne.
Much of the wine was sold in the street for 4s. or
ss. a bottle, and is said by the anguished Agk to
have gone to stock the sideboards of surrounding
bagnios.
Who was really responsible for the Hope-
toun shout of champagne to the Melb. unemployed ?
Fancy filling empty stomachs with a high-
voltage stimulant—the suddenness of the drunk,
and, alas, its brevity ! Better to have given them
good solid beef and beer, especially in this cold
weather. It was Hopetoun’s wine, but was it
Hopetoun’s folly to decree that the wine itself,
and not the value of it, should go to the hungry ?
» * * •
Suggested by one correspondent that Hope-
toun’s champagne for the Melbourne unemployed
was a satire, or a grim joke, or something, for the
politicians who drank his free wine so long by
“kidding” him that they were going to raise his
screw. Whatever it was, joke or gibe, Hopetoun
ought to explain. His humor, if it was meant as
humor, needs an interpreter.

In Victoria the proposed “ Celebration ”
of the King's crowning mostly panned out in the
country districts to a matter of a bun and a medal
for the kiddies. The grocer’s idea of complete
joy—a full stomach and a tin gaud ! One Shire
Council (Fern Tree Gully) struck a sweet novelty
by bestowing medals on old age pensioners—just
as in Hingland they dress Charity-school children
in a special rig-out, so that they shall never be
mistaken for ordinary youngsters.

Tom by conflicting emotions of pseudo-
loyalty and thrift, Victoria made a first-class ass
of itself over its Coronation celebrations. First

Gov. -Gen. decided to drop the illuminations and
go ahead with such bun-scrambles as were pro-
posed. Next they reckoned that, as the flags and
flare ups were all ready, it would be a pity to
waste them, so Thursday’s papers announced that
the holiday would be kept, and fireworks and
review would go ahead as intended. Then some-
body experienced a rush of com monsense, and
realised that as the King was lying on what might
prove to be his death-bed, and that as there might
never be any coronation, it would be the acme of
bad taste to light up and rejoice. Even then the
feeble “authorities” hadn’t strength enough to
act “on their own,” but must needs cable to
Chamberlain, who promptly replied : “All fes-
tivities postponed ; you should adopt a similar
course.” This news arrived shortly before noon,
when most of the populace had taken up good
positions for the review, and of course there
wasn’t any review or illuminations, and most of
the crowd passed the wasted holiday in discussing
the King’s illness and looking vacantly at the
Yarra. But at least one individual, the Mayor of
Prahran, celebrated the occasion by sticking to
his programme and holding his annual ball on
Thursday evening ! It hasn’t transpired yet
whether Poet Fitzgibbon, Sympathiser in Chief
to the Royal Families of Europe, has slaughtered
this Mayor. Probably he will slay him with a
poem.

Governor Tennyson had a big day in
Adelaide on (what should have been) Coronation
Day. After putting in the morning at State
affairs, he drove round to all the suburban
recreation-grounds where children were being
fited. These lie literally miles apart in a kind of
circle, and the outlying ones had not expected
him, the feat being considered impossible. But
he did the round, and got back to the Central
Oval in time for the second half of the inter-State
football match (on which game the whole Tennyson
family is particularly keen), finish in- the day at
the intercession service at the Cathedral ! He
further announced that, barring unfavorable news
of the King, he would be pre-
sent, as arranged, at the speci-
ally - commanded “Tw e 1 fth
Night” performance on Fri-
day. and the S. AJ.C. races
on Saturday. A good all-round
man.

The butting of N.S.W.
Judges against juries, now quite
a fashionable entertainment
with the minor Bench, will, if
continued much longer, goad
Parliament into making a use-
ful example. A dismissed
Judge, it is to be borne in mind,
loses his title to a pension. An
old proverb says, “A fool, un-
less he knows the law, is never
a great fool.”

The noble family of Aber-
gavenny, represented in Aus-
tralia by Lord Richard Nevill,
seems to have a peculiar lean-
ing to the Law Courts. Lady
Cowley (a sister of Lord “Dick”
aforesaid), whose divorce from
her first husband was obtained
by herself, has chosen to retain
the title after her second mar-
riage, and last month she
scored some further notoriety
by bringing a libel action
against a little rag that stig-
matised her claim to the re-
pudiated Cowley’s title as “a
contemptible piece of snob-
bery.” The fair plaintiff told
the Court that, inasmuch as
her son by the first husband
would become Earl Cowley if
he lived long enough, she
wished him to know his mother
always as Countess Cowley
a reasonable answer to the
charge of “snobbery.” The
jury gave her a verdict but
showed their opinion as to the
necessity for dragging such a
case into court by awarding
her a paltry £lOO damages.
British juries are slowly losing
their reverence for the offspring
of noble marquises, and sich.
Here was a Lady, with a birth-
title in the first place, and a
dissolved - marriage title in
the second place, seeking cash
solace for a newspaper’s insult
to her family pride, and the jury assessed the
damage at £lOO. Twenty years ago she would
have got twenty times as much.

The administration of the South Aus-
tralian Public Service has nearly always been
weak ; wherever possible a mechanical system has
been adopted. The fact is, little South Australia,
living so much by itself, is mainly its own cousin,
and mechanical promotions, &c., have had the
recommendation of raising the. least dust. As the
naturally pushful young man is thus discouraged
from pushing, lie doesn’t do it (certainly there is
not much ahead worth pushing for); and so this
service sleeps sounder than any other on the main-
land. Even in its scheme of retrenchment it is
mechanical—it just lops off all heads over 70. So,
too, in its appointment of Inspector-General of
fechools, deferred for five or six years, the easy
mechanical prooess has triumphed at last, and the
K? 1 ?* lns pector has been put up. At least two
Ministers have wanted to appoint a younger and
more vigorous man, but—it was South Australia !

A N.S. W. civil servant:—
Re the difficulty the Vic. authorities have in filling
goodpewtaorui from the Departments under present rules
JN.&.W. is rapidly getting as bad. The prizes in the
service are few, in comparison to the number of officers,
ana day by day promotion grows slower. Go from the
start; Examinations are held to test the eligibility of
candidates. The successful ones are appointed at, say,
±5O. Promotion to £l2O is fairly rapid. The brake is
then put on and it takes 20 years to reach £3OO. There
the civil servant must stop. Parliament declines to allow
an increase over this figure unless by its own vote and,
before he can reach £4OO, the public servant must have
luck, opportunity, ability (perhaps) and the eir of his
chief, or the man who runs his chief, besides having
to catch the Assembly (with a strong Minister) in a com-
plaisant mood. Then he might be told that there is no
money to grant increases, and he must await more pros-
perous times. Summed up, this means that one per cent,
will get past £3OO out of all those who enter the service
pj competitive examination. Dismissal from the service
18 a:r unknown, unless one is a hardened criminal,
and the only way to a step forward is over the corpse of
the man in front. And the man in front is always a first-
class life in the A.M.P. If new billets are created, the
chances are that a political outsider will get them,
therefore, it is not to be wondered at that the service is
being lowered to a dull level of mediocrity, and that it
will soon be hopeless to expect to find men of talent when
required.
S. Australia's retrenchment scheme dis-
closes the fact that at the Govt, printory an old
lady of 73 still draws her 6s. a day as a bookbinder.
Ihe record for the office, though, is held by a
compositor who at 77 still hangs on to his “ case ”
Ihe biggest sacrifices will be in the office of the
.Registrar-General, where the three tallest heads
are struck off; and in the police, which loses its
four senior inspectors, though not its chief.

The Commonwealth Postal Dept, finds
that the annual output of blank telegraph forms
gratis far exceeds, legitimate public needs. The
latest official idea is to charge a shilling for each
book of 100 forms supplied to business firms—
the people who are least likely to use them for
scribbling paper. Considering that the most
habitual wasters of telegraph-office stationery are
the men who shake ” forms by the handful from
the counters and tables where they lie loose, a
better rule would be to exact payment for all of
them—ls per 100 in the book, or Id. for six loose
ones. But what does the yearly leakage of
telegraph forms amount to, anyhow?

Published in Sydney Prince Alfred Hos-
pital annual report (what had been carefully kept
from the public) that there was a big shortage in
the late secretary’s accounts —reduced by sums
recovered to £1034 14s. 2d. The ex-sec. has since
died. As is usual, “he enjoyed the full con-
fidence,” &c. They always do. A man whose
accounts are drifting on to rocks is not likely to
show in his face what his figures would tell if
they were properly investigated. It’s books that
call for auditing, not conversations.

N.S. W. Assembly should pass a resolution
forbidding the use of Government launches to any
private persons, except on regular scale payment.
And, under the resolution, M’sP. conducting their
own private picnics should rank as private
persons.
WASTED ELOQUENCE.
MR. TESTY (whose girl is a nice one, and so he's
busy now): “’No, I won't give you a shilling.
You’d only spend it on drink."
MR. DE BEAUFORT (somewhat broken in boot and
fortune): “I assure you, sir, I am on'y
collecting with a vino to obtaining money to
go to the Coronation as the scion of”
(Left talking).
Missioner Geil advertised in the Adelaide
papers, re a ladies’ meeting, thusly : “ Spots !
bring Bibles and butter-dishes.” When the
women had assembled the hall took on the appear-
ance of an olla podrida of butter-dishes and Bibles.
The suspense was tremendous as the attendants
handed round black spots gummed on one side
and poured water into the butter-dishes. In the
midst of a vicious silence Geil told the ladies to
open at a certain chapter and affix the black spots
so that they could find the place again, advising
those who did not like to lick the spots to dip
them in the butter-dishes. That was all the joke.
It wasn’t much of a joke either. A spasm of
disappointment ran through the audience causing
the water to spill over its dress, and there was
much internal anguish, for there is amongst the
ladies more wailing over one spoilt dress than re-
joicing over 10,000 saved souls. Geil, as a
humorist, fell to zero over the silly butter-dish
funnyism. The woman who had carried a dish
two miles in great bewilderment merely to have
water poured into it, so that she could wet a
kind of stamp and stick it on Geil’s text, in case
she wanted to look at the text again, only
regarded herself as having been taken in by a
rather dull April-foolish ness.

Instead of a balance-sheet, the Salvation
Army in N.S.W. publishes the “fact” that
nearly 2,000,000 meals and 10,000 beds were pro-
vided last year ; fallen women to the number of
3000 rescued, and half of them converted ; also
800 discharged prisoners were taken into the
Home, and more than half of them brought to the
repentance-bench and put into billets. Butf.why
not let us know what money was made out of the
work done by all these people variously dealt
with ? It would be too much to ask what becomes
of the converts. If the woman of the street
is converted at the rate of 1500 a year, she ought
shortly to become extinct. See the city any night
of the year and judge whether that is so !

“ Alpar ” : All male N.S.W. State school
teachers are now being drilled on Saturdays, with
the idea, I’m told, of attaining a uniform standard
of proficiency in all schools. Hitherto, drill has
been a “patchy” subject; but better things are
looked for after the teachers —some of them raw
recruits—have had a course of 16 drills. These
men give up their Saturdays for the benefit of the
children in their respective districts ; and some
of them think it hard that they should have to
pay train and other expenses incidental to attend-
ing at centres of instruction. One mart pays
3s. 3d. weekly for fare alone. That —to a battler
to live and look decent —is a consideration.

An English paper tells that in an English
public school, near London, a suggestion that the
children should sing the National Gorsave revealed
the startling fact that none of them knew it.
Further inquiry spread over 72 children only
unearthed ten who had heard of the Anthem. The
time is really coming when Seddon will have to
declare war against England for disloyalty to
itself.
T’other day a depressed stranger entered
the (office of the Vic. Under Treasurer, remark-
ing that he had £3 on his conscience, and paid it
in. Noteworthy that no one ever offers to give
the State more than £2 or £3 for an easy con-
science. According to Vic. figures the average
easy conscience is worth 275. 6d., and no man has
yet wanted an easy conscience so badly as to be
willing to give £lO for it.

The 50th anniversary of the Gundagai
(N.S.W.) flood, that swept away 70 buildings and
drowned about 90 persons, fell on June 26, and,
in the absence of the Coronation, gave the local
residents an absorbing theme for talk.

The anniversary of the burning of St.
Mary’s Cathedral, Sydney, on June 29, excited
plenty of reminiscences, but, like its predecessors,
failed to fix for certain whether or not an aged
man, once the Government hangman, was con-
sumed in the fire. Tradition has it that he dwelt
in a cellar or cloister in the basement, and perished
in the flames. The fire occurred in 1865.
An application was recently made to
N.S.W. .Reg.-General for the appointment of
a Guardian of Minors for the district of Casino
(to give consent to the marriage of an orphan
girl who was under age). The reply was
W. O. Bundock of Wiangarie, George K. Johnson
of Cannonbar and James Bray, Police-Magistrate,
are all Guardians of Minors in the district of Casino.
The humor lies in the fact that Mr. Bundock died
about four years ago, Mr. Bray about 12 years ago,
while Mr. Johnson is believed to be also dead. At
all events he’s not now known in Casino district.
This should take the bun for official ineptitude.
N.S.W. Governor Rawson, eager to seek
the bubble reputation at the common mouth,
didn’t funk it, last Saturday, when he found that
he had to share the opening ceremony of Pyrmont
Bridge with a breezy, horny-handed crowd. There
was no exclusive dais, no vice-regal frill arranged
for ; Admiral Rawson had to push and shove with
the rest of them. But he didn’t seem to mind. It
was the reporters of the daily press who suffered
most from shocked dignity, and the representa-
tive of one solemn paper was only comforted when
he found that the broad and generous back which
he had been using as a “rest ” for his shorthand-
book was (solemn fact) the Governor’s. When
his Excellency was unconsciously subjected
to sucli indignity, he thought he might
put up with a little jostling. Even Lady
Rawson didn’t escape from an occasional shove.
When jolly-dog Rawson rose to harangue (that’s
the most suitable word) the people he called for
three cheers for the contractor, and one bloke
promptly corrected him: “ No—cheers for the
King first”—and the Governor apologised and
stood corrected. It was, on the whole, the most
off-hand vice-regal “function” that N.S.W. has
seen for a long while, and if Governor Rawson
would like to go into Parliament, he’s a dead bird
for one of the waterside labor constituencies.
IN PUSH SOCIETY.—OBVIOUS
PARSON: “Do you take this woman
for your lawful wedded wife?
“BINGO” JONES: “Strike me pink, boss, d’ye
think I’d lose a day’s pay to come ’ere an’
act the goat?”
A pathetically humorous tribute to the
great god Respectability turned up in Melbourne
t’other day, when a young mother was shown to
have abandoned the infant which had been born
in wedlock, but had arrived rather too soon after
the ceremony. She and the father had been
engaged for years, and she could not face the
disgrace of her own parents learning the truth.
The court fined her £5.
Some Vic. residents lately gave
the local police sergeant a “ send-off ”
upon the occasion of his retirement
from the service. After several guests
had said the usual things, somebody
called upon the sergeant’s assistant-
constable, a burly and unsophisticated
Hibernian. Up begot, and, said he—
“ Gintlemen, Oi did not think Oi
would be called upon to give ividence
in this case. Oi can only corroborate
what the previous witnesses have
said. I know the mahn before the
coort well.” And so on.

A much-married Teutonic
gentleman who has an inordinate
desire for the society of single ladies
of tender age, made an assignation
with a girl whom he had long be-
sieged. The girl’s big brother (a tram
conductor) also turned up shortly
after, and gave Emperor Bill’s sub-
ject the father of a hiding in the inky
darkness. Next day and the next the
Eursuer of virtuous maids stayed at
ome. The following morning saw
him in the usual place tramming it
to town, with heavy dark goggles over
his eyes. “ Morning, sir ! ” remarked
the conductor; “bad eyes? ” “ Yes, I
gannot stand ze glare; in fact, the
Australian sun iz too sdrong for my

pretty warm, even taken the skin off my knuckles,

The Sydney jewellery firm of Fairfax and
Roberts recently manufactured a bishop’s staff in
solid silver, and the object was alluded to with
great gravity in the local press. What a bishop
wants with this mighty prong of metal is not very
clear, but it is certainly cjuite unsuited to Aus-
tralia. An Australian bishop’s staff should be
short and manageable. There should be a thick
end, which he can use, if he is a city bishop, to
keep off the push if it besets him when he is re-
turning late from seeing a sick supporter, and a
whistle let into it so that he can call a shilling—
not more than a shilling—cab. The other end
should be a spike, so that he can use it, if he is a
country bishop and gets bushed in a dry spot, to
dig for water (the country bishop can also use the
thick end to keep off wild dogs). And there
should be a kind of hook with which to hang the
property up on a nail, for, if it is leaned up against
a corner, it is apt to slide down heavily on the
floor in the night, and disturb the episcopal
slumbers. This is a practical country, and old-
world frills and ornaments are out of place.

N.S.W. Comptroller General Neitenstein
submits his annual prisons report, which is not
quite such dolorous reading as it used to be. The
“inside” population is decreasing (though that
is probably due to the increase in the number
of criminals that escape arrest), and the inside
horrors-—dark cells, bridles, gags, cats, &c. —have
almost ceased to be. Two points stand out
demanding attention. First, the one-sided
arrangement whereby the Victorian discharged
criminal gets a chance in N.S.W., while the
N.S. W. man found the other side of the Murray
within three years of his discharge is liable to 12
months in irons. Common sense and common
humanity should end that. Second is the number
of prisoners held in default of fines. A small
instalment of a time-payment system has enabled
1204 to buy themselves out, and save the State
keep and custody aggregating 42 years—value not
less than £2OOO. If all that is practicable were
done in that way those figures might be much
increased. In Darlinghurst 80 per cent, of the
prisoners are held in default of fines !

“Domainiac” sends along a solid bit of
philosophy for use by the social rank and file :
YVas recently sitting: on a bench in
Hyde Park, Sydney, when a dilapi-
dated female of the “ Jiggetty Jane”
type planted herself alongside of me.
Said she, after staring'at me for a few
moments with her bleary, blood-
shot eyes, “You’re a respectable
married man, I s’pose?” “Very
much so, madam,” I answered,
for safety—and hurriedly rose to
depart. “Stop!” said the
woman hurriedly, as she jerked
me back on the seat by the tail
of my coat. “ I only want to
give you a bit of advice. I
don’t want anything of
you. I couldn’t swallow a
drink just now for a for-
tune. But I like j'our face,
and if you’re really married
take my advice, sonny, and
never take in lodgers!
Look at me—the pretty
picture that I am ! —and
know that lodgers have
done it all! I was married
and lived happy till my
husband took in a lodger.
This was a quiet, hard-
working chap, and he and I
became first friends, then
lovers, and—well, familiarity
breeds consent. No sooner
had I taken the wrong step
when I became sorry and was
pleased when the lodger sud-
denly departed. My husband
had suspected nothing, and I
was determined to go straight
for the future. But, finding the
7s. 6d. handy on rent day, my hus-
band, despite my remonstrances,
took in another lodger. No. 2 w f as
a hard, cynical, sneering man, and
at first I disliked him, but the
lodger-habit had a strong grip on
me, and in less than a month’s
time he had re-placed No. 1.
He treated me entirely different, and
abused me awfully as soon as he got me into his power.
Unexpectedly, one night, lodger No. 1 returned, and,
despite my hitter protests, was duly accommodated by
my husband with the only other spare room. Dodging
my husband had been hard work at times, but now I had
to dodge lodger No. 1 when I was with No. 2, No. 2 when
with No. 1, and the husband when with either. This
nearly drove me mad, and I took to drink. The two
lodgers were the first to get an inkling of the state of
affairs. They became fearfully jealous of each other, and
finally each put my husband on his guard against the
other. My husband watched, found me out and kicked
me into the street. I appealed singly to the lodgers, but
both turned dog, and refused to assist me either with
money or advice. Neither of the wretches would buy me
a drink to-day if I was walking on my tongue. So take
my advice, young fellow, and keep clear of lodgers.” She
rose and staggered away with the air of one who has dis-
charg'd a sacred duty.

So far as N.S.W. census papers show,
something like every eighth man and woman is
away from home on any particular night. (It is
assumed that census-night was an average night).
The ordinary fool who doesn’t know much about
those things would not expect that the figures for
the sect of the Calithumpians would differ much
from those of the United Mumbo-Jumbos : but
they do. Of the big sects the R.C. apparently
lets his wife go holidaying oftenest ; the C. of E.
and the Presbyterians stick to the average. Only
one in every nine Baptist wives was away, and one
in every 13 Congregationalists. Of “ Free-
thinkers, Agnostics,” &c., one in five ; of other
non-Christians no less than 579 in 857 —which
perhaps means that it’s easier to describe yourself
as a non-Christian when your wife is away from
home than when she isn’t. Without Coghlan’s
latest N.S.W. census figures most people
would probably have thought that, of all
the religious sects, the Jews would show the
smallest percentage of mixed martiages. As a
matter of fact, they do take this place some
of the way. Of 889 Rachels and Rebekahs who
were at home on census night, Isaac and Jacob
watched over 781 of them —that is a bigger pro-
portion than any other “church” shows. But, on
the other hand, Isaac and Jacob have been sad
wanderers; possibly the supply of Rachels and
Rebekahs has, at some time or other, run short.
Anyhow, there were 1034 Jewish husbands whose
wives were at home on census night, and. as said
just now, only 781 Jewish spouses among
them ; so that every fourth Jew has a Christian
wife, while only one in every eight Jewish wivis
has a Christian husband. Using plain figures,
one Church of England wife in every seven has
some other brand of husband ; after them, come
the Lutherans (where a common taste in religion
has, perhaps, less to answer for than a common
taste in cookery), the Methodists, Congrega-
tionalists, Presbyterians, and Unitarians, the last
two about one in five each. In spite of all the
whipping-in, the R.C.’s are low down the list; a
limb or two more than one in every four wives in
the faith is yoked with an unbeliever. On the
other hand, less than one in every six R.C. hus-
bands has some other sort of wife. Right down at
the bottom of the pit are the Salvarmies —only
1078 red guernseys among the husbands of 1439
women who wear the blue bonnet of a shrieking
life.

THE HEART’S DUNGEONS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In many a heart is a chamber
That with cobweb-curtained door
Dumb, forgotten, keeps its secret
Since the key was lost of yore.
But one day when skies seem clearest.
Falls a flash that lights and burns
On the key that lies long-hidden . . .
How the hinge groans as it turns !
Sad reproachful eyes of beauty
Still unrighted in its wrong—
Threatening, leering, mocking faces—
Through the narrow doorway throng.
For the heart has Bastille-dungeons
That love not the honest day ;
Well it is that Keeper Memory
Doth so oft his keys mislay.

suspense, and tightened nerves, and the Corona-
tion-red shot with black. The weather, day after
day, a morning mist, then blue and gold; yet it
makes for what one has called a “ghastly, thin-
faced time, for starving stock and stock-owners.
, Coronation honors caused a flicker; when that
tor Mr. Bee was announced in the evening press
there was a rush to scores of telephones to con-
gratulate his wife. She is a popular woman;
unassuming, with a group of good-looking
daughters, and some fine diamonds; and fine
daughters and diamonds make a fair setting for a
“ title.” There is the pathos of too late in the
honors for the late Premier of W.A. and Dr
Logan Campbell, of M.L. The first died before
the honor was announced ; the second is 85 years
cj.ch And Adye Douglas (Tas.) also comes to his
Knight in the gloaming of life. He has seen 87
winters.
Sydney is very full of sheep-men here for the
Show and the sales. When the State Governor
goes hence he will bear away a large pastoral
education acquired on the spot. The effect of the
times was put so straightl.v to him by Mr. Suttor,
the President, at the opening of the Show, that his
bushy eyebrows fairly waggled with sympathy.
In 91 our flocks numbered 62,000,000 sheep ; at
the end of ’Ol there were under 41,000,000, and
within two years the value of wool sold in
Australia dropped from £13,000,000 to about
£6,000,000.” Afterwards the Gov. put blue
ribbons round the necks of the champion ewe and
ram, made some more speeches, and looked awhile
at the sheep-dog trials. The dogs had to drive
three sheep round two flag-posts, through a hurdle,
round a third post, twice though a maltese cross,
and then into a pen in lOmin. All of which has a
tendency to spoil good dogs by encouraging them
to waste time in fancy evolutions instead of taking
the sheep the shortest cut to the tank. Anyhow,
neither the President or the Gov. could have done
it.
A fascinating American book, “ Wild Animals
I Have Known,” says: “ The dog’s nose tells him
what the clubman’s eye learns when he looks over
the. club register.” So when the sheep-dog
Biddy ’ strolled out into the paddock, sniffing
the tracks of collies which were at previous trials,
she was thinking “So that ‘ Darkie ’ is down here,
is he. Br-r-r-r, wait till I settle with him ! ” She
nosed some more, then looked up saying, “and
here’s that cur ‘ Boon’s ’ tracks. Smelling of
bullock’s liver, too. I didn’t get anv liver; I owe
her an ear-chewing. Perhaps we’ll go home in
the same dog-box, then I’ll pay. M’Gracious !
why Bros’. ‘ Needle ’ is in town ; I knew
her mother, and one of her fools of sons.” Biddy
and Darkie took prizes.
To console His Ex. for the many disappoint-
ments in ball-going the Minister for Works
thoughtfully provided him, on Saturday, with a
bridge to open. New Pyrmont Bridge (Sydney)
gives one the loveliest swing—much better than a
gate. A man presses a button and it swings
round and back in 44sec. I’d like to hire it, and
swing all day—especially if the persons I don’t
like were waiting to cross. It will never bear a
heavier load than it carried last Saturday, when
nearly all adult Pyrmont, with considerable of
the infancy-in-arms, was crowded on to it. There
was a lot of human nature in the men of the
crowd, for the lo ’dest and heartiest cheers were
given for Miss Rawson.
The little vice-regal dais was quickly swamped
by youths with handkerchiefs knotted on their
necks, and damsels (the serrated edges of whose
wide-brimmed sailor hats rasped the hair-nets off
the invited women guests, and abraded the necks
and cheeks of the vice-regal women). They were
microscopically observant, these invaders, and
very frank. One named Florrie secured a capital
position by shifting the Minister’s daughter
with her elbows and saw-brim, and unselfishly
shared the knowledge thus acquired with one Bill,
who was in the back ground. “ The Governor’s
coat ’as a little ladder of black cotton ’ook ’oles
down ther left front side, Bill.” “ Has it ! ” said
Bill, interestedly; “ that must be ter ’ang ’is
medals an’orders on.” “ You’d think,” continued
Florrie, “ that he’d ’ave a second coat without
them loops fer dyes like this. Bill, tell Nellie
that Lydy Rawsing has a bangle with a gold acorn
and a watch, and a lucky pig on it.” “I’ll pass
my knife along ter you,” said Bill, “an’ yer get a
bit o’ the blue ribbon when she cuts it.” So Florrie
shoved a few more guests aside, and, almost before
Lady Rawson had severed the broad ribbon, had
cut half-a-foot of it with Bill’s jack-knife, and
pinned it over her chest.
On behalf of the contractors for the bridge Mrs.
O’Sullivan was presented with a splendid diamond
and sapphire pendant, and Pyrmont demanded
that it be “ parssed round.” Bill and Nellie were
displeased that Florrie’s aunts on the outskirts of
the crowd couldn’t have a look. The Minister for
Works himself got a pair of gold mounted spec-
tacles “ to enable him to see his way to build more
bridges.” George Dibbs spoke and presented
Lady Rawson with a cup which he had carved
from one of the piles of the old bridge. A similar
one was handed to Wor's. The cups’were like
chalices, highly brilliantiued, and carried inscrip-
tions on silver shields.
No doubt ex -Premier Dibbs is an artist in turning
and polishing. He made me a fine pipe and a set of
blouse-studs from a bit of firewood a few years
« r - r o ; and only quite recently a beastly cockatoo
f ™ next door came in, climbed up to where the
pipe was stuck in a skull’s mouth, and nibbled it
to splinters. I thrashed him nearly featherless
with a bath towel. All the time I thrashed him
he was screaming : “I’m having a healthy time
of it ! I’m having a healthy time of it! ” He
hasn’t been in since.
Mr. Dan O’Connor, of course, also spoke, and,
of course, quoted Horatius and his bridge.
Equally, of course, he wished that the bridge
should be called “ the Darling,” on account of the
coruscations of beauty that adorned it that day.
There’s a lot of method in Mr. O’Connor’s speech-
mania. If a man pays loud and extravagant
platform compliments to women, and has a com-
mand of poetic quotations, he is sure to be reported
somehow, even though in derision.
The wail of a woman student: Many of the
women graduates are dissatisfied with the con-
dition attached to the newly-inaugurated Queen
Victoria Memorial Scholarship for girls. The
condition is that the winner, if possessed of suf-
ficient private means to defray her University ex-
penses, must hand over the money-portion of the
prize to a poorer competitor, thus reducing the
Q-V.S. to the anomalous position of being a
scholarship, in theory and a bursary in practice.
The two things are not by any means synonymous.
Each, it is true, is equally a sum of money given
to a student to be spent on a Uni. career, but
there the resemblance ends. A scholarship is an
honor publicly awarded to only conspicuous merit,
while a bursary is merely financial assistance
awarded to those applicants who show “ sufficient
promise of benefiting by a University course,” and
who may, and in some cases do, hold the lowest
places on the entrance lists. Prof. MacCallum,
the only speaker at the inaugural meeting who went
into the subject in any detail, remarked that no uni-
versity had yet tried to combine these systems.
But he might have gone a little further and asked
the Q.V.S. Committee to try the experiment on
something smaller first. Other speakers alluded
in touching. terms to the poor girl of striking
genius who is at present excluded from ’varsity
advantages by reason of her poverty. They forgot
or didn’t know the fact that each’ year four Govt,
bursaries (fees, books, and £2O per year to town
and £5O to country students) are awarded to girls
who have attended public schools for a year pre-
vious to exam., while girls from outside schools
have always enjoyed a very fair share of the 11
University bursaries annually awarded. The
matric. records for the last ten years show that
the girls who have taken only third class
honors in.this exam, would have been provided for
by the existing bursaries even if each one of them
needed such help.
You will see Max Schluter’s photo, this week ;
he is a young Danish violinist, a pupil of Joachim
and Emanuel Wirth. He will play before the
Gov.-General, Governor Rawson, family and
suites at Cranbrook next week, and later in
public. At Paling’s, last week, he gave a recital,
and with the passionate grief of his violin in the
“ Chanson Triste ” wrung the heart from everyone
who heard. Then he flashed through a brilliant
composition of his own. His soprano supporter
will be handsome and tuneful Mrs. Gilbert
Wilson, daughter of the evergreen Mrs. Palmer
(Carandini), who has been living in Brisbane
almost since her marriage.
Providence is good to the Children’s Hospital.
Last week an anonymous lady was moved to give
£lOOO to that institution. There are wagers the
lady’s Christian name will prove to be Eadith.
All the illustrated papers are reproducing por-
traits of Queen Alexandra as she was when she
married, as she was when carrying Prince George
pick-a-back; as she was 25 or 30 years ago, and as
she is (said to be) to-day. The contrast shows the
immense progress made by photography. The
Queen of 30 years, ago is an ordinarily-pretty,
rather inane-faced girl. To-day, a woman of over
50, she is (pictorially) absolutely beautiful; and no
older than she looks in those old-fashioned but
probably correct prints.
Miss Margaret Flockton, the Sydney artist, has
managed to get at least four Australian flower-
spirits to reveal themselves to her. The American
Tobacco Co. is issuing reproductions of her panel-
paintings of the waratah, the broad-leafed wattle,
the native fuschia, and the honey-flower. The
work is beautifulj each separate flower seems to
say, “ Verily, it is I.” The reproductions are the
most charming things of their kind yet issued in
Australia, and every household of artistic tastes
should acquire a set, to frame and hang up so that
they may be a joy for ever.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“The hardest-worked official of that luckless
non-Coronation Day was Better-Not-Wally. He
had only half recovered from a chill to the bones
himself, and was kept croaking explanations,
orders, information, particulars, to all and sundry
through the telephone from early dawn to foggy
dark that Thursday. The cancelling of the
Governor-General’s evening party was the cruellest
blow of all. It was only at mid-day that the
scratching was communicated to official folk.
Then society people kept a-ting-a-linging to the
weary Wally all day long for news, and yet in the
end there were many with cabs ordered and hair
in crimp at 7 o’clock, setting about togging up for
the party.
The dress-builders have made their pile. They
had been cajoled and harassed during the last
week by guests invited to the two V.R.
junkets. No expense was to be spared. The
Melbourne lady - upholsterers took the hint,
and piled on stitchings, flutings, pleatings,
tuckings. And now the chiffon triumphs—the
treasured toilettes precious with laborious effect—
lie in lavender till the King gets quite well and
the day of rejoicing wheels round again. Great is
the disappointment of the girls who were booked
to debut at the cancelled evening party; they
aim. ; st certainly will not get the chance now of
making an entry into society under the eyes of the
Governor-General.
“At a recent tea-scramble, a fortune-teller’s
tent was the attraction of the day. A strange
feature of the rush was the number of married
women (fat and old, too) who sought to approach
the oracle. Girls, bubbling over with excitement
to know when their dark or fair ‘ Fate ’ was timed
to arrive, and other future happenings, were left
out in the cold, while the old women scrambled
in and out of the tent, with toques askew
and tongues busy recounting the bliss (?) the
gods had in store for them. ‘There’s Mrs. Toney,’
said one irritable miss ‘ with seven children,
having her hand read ! Hasn’t she had enough
fortune by this?’ But the aged mother of seven
evidently wanted the mysterious veil still further
lifted on her already crowded life. The seer plays
on the vanities of womankind in an almost in-
describable way. The uglier the client, the more
ready she is for the five shillings’ worth of palpi-
tating, impatient Romeos provided for her. The
fat and forty matron (her removed ring leaves a
tell-tale dint on the index-finger) glows with
pleasure as she is told of the young man with dark,
classical ringlets who will win her love—with
pleasure at the thought that her charms still
warrant such a prophecy, and also with some of
the vague, expectant trembling of the girl who
watches the East, half hoping, half fearing to see
uprise there a rose-oloud bodeful of the dawn of
Love.
‘‘The daughters of Senators and Reps, from other
States are almost unanimous in declaring that
they will be sorry when the session ends, as they
are having a real good time in Melb. The local
grand dames aren’t too warmly enthusiastic in their
treatment of the inter-State girls, especially dames
with girls of their own to marry off. But fickle
man is attracted by fresh faces, and male atten-
tion makes up for much female snubbing. At
afternoon parties, receptions, and such I have
seen some very pronounced cold-shouldering. But
the Federal misses always came up smiling.
“Mrs. Corbet made merry during those few
days which intervalled her return from Adelaide
and her second set-out for England. Mrs. George
Chirnside, Lady Hutton, and many other spark-
ling matrons feted the horsey dame right royally.
Mrs. Corbet is making the trip ’Ome this time in
the company of her children.
“Descendants of Westralia’s ‘Six Families’
mourn the untimely taking off of Premier Leake,
whose grandfather and granduncle were amongst
the most respected of W.A. pioneers. Subse-
quent Leakes have maintained the social prestige
of the clan, and have intermarried with tne Lee-
Steeres, the Brouns, and the Stones. The late
Premier’s grandmother, Mrs. Luke Leake (mother
of Sir Luke of that ilk), was a prominent identity
in the highest circles of old-time Sandgroperdom.
A beauty in her youth, the Junoesque dame
retained her social knack through thick and thin,
even when facing the music as a large-sized widow
with a big family of frisky boys to educate on
small means. The other five 4 Families ’ appre-
ciated cheery Mrs. Leake so highly that her
memory is green to this day—3o years after the
echoes of the laughter aroused by her ‘unex-
pectedness’ have died away. Soft-hearted
‘dads,’ given to ‘ sparing the rod and spoiling the
child ’ in their own households, used to get politely-
worded notes, presenting Mrs. Leake’s compli-
ments, and ‘ would Mr. So-and-So kindly visit her
at his earliest convenience for the purpose of
chastising her fatherless boys.’ Westralians of
that period never dreamt of declining the hest of
a lady, and a widow at that, but their ohivalry
galled them badly at such times, especially as the
‘ fatherless boys ’ began to grow big and re-
bellious.
“A huge crowd farewelled the Runic (White
Star line) on Saturday. A jaunt ’Ome for £2O or
so has attractions even for a section of the
‘ Naicest,’ and, as passenger lists are not pub-
lished, sensitive travellers are not given away as
‘cheap-trippers.’ Mrs. Andrew Rowan, two of
her daughters, Lady Madden and ‘the Ruby,’
farewelled a young relative on Saturday. Tne
Chief Justicess looks 10 years younger since her
retirement from the vice-regal pinnacle. She
laughs quite merrily now that ‘Gor-Save’ has
had time to wear off her nerves. Her daughter,
too, appeared literally shining with health that
day on the pier.
“ Some day there’ll be an awful accident on an
out-going ship. Only one gangway for serried
masses of people, converging from all parts of the
vessel to reaon the pier while gongs sound din-
ningly * all ashore, ’ and in the thick of the fuss a
procession of men, carrying mail-bags, force their
way on board in the teeth of the would-be dis-
embarkers. First time a woman faints in the
crush, or a pickpocket starts a scare, a mass of
‘weaker vessels ’ will be hustled over the side.
“Lady Hutton is one of the few women in
Australia who always greet the Gov.-General
with a profound courtesy. Whether on Fleming-
ton terrace or in a ball-room, the fair-haired dame
bobs in approved maid-of-honor style to His Ex.
This amiable lady is constantly observed at social
shivoos prompting her hubby to go and speak to
someone or other. The swearing Chief forgets
names, faces, and social obligations, but his
thoughtful and sweet-tempered partner prods him
ever so gently in the ribs, and bids him to go and
say a word to Miss Blank. ‘ Who ? ’ queries the
warrior with the fret-work face. ‘ Miss Blank,’
whispers his dame. ‘Do I know her ? ’ ‘ Yes, of
course you do—the Blanks of Orrong Road.’ Then
the Chief squares his shoulders, swaggers along,
and does the correct thing, while his blonde half
nods her pleasure. Big-Chief Hutton relates the
incident, and Miss Blank is convulsed.
“At the postponed tea-party of President
Wrixon and his wife, at ‘ Raheen, George Jenkins
and others of his ilk were not able to sport their
knee-breeches and laces, so that, to them, the
show was shorn of its finest features. The
Governor Clarkes were the special guests, and for
them a chorus of the programmed singers
warbled several verses of a National hymn.
The benevolent Miss Wrixon, who wears a
halo of the good Samaritan about her bare
and lofty brow, was diamondless and sheen-
less _ in black, and looked like a convent
novice amid much worldly vanity and pomp. The
Surple and Ethiopian garments of Archbishop
arr caught the breeze at ‘ Raheen ’ like angel
wings, and carfied their wearer in full sail around
the rooms. Dean Vance, gaitered and long-coated,
was another staid divine, while the brother
of Lady Janet Clarde (Rev. Evelyn Snodgrass)
played the part generally set down in fiction for
the genial and popular curate. Some of the finest
women in the crowd were Mrs. Arthur Moule,
Mrs. Norman Armytage, and Mrs. Donald
Mackinnon. The most remarkable frock of the
occasion was sported by the grey-haired Miss
‘ Millie’ Carter. It was a grey and black towel-
like material with lacey tattooings laid thereon.
Mrs. W. Croker was a leaf from a fashion-journal.
“ There was an amusing incident on the road to
‘ Raheen ’ last week. The distance of this man-
sion from trams and trains is considerable, and all
did not understand that fact. Two smart girls
essayed to walk from the Kew tram, but they
were out of training, and soon pulled up on the
road for a rest and an adjustment of the points of
the compass. No cabs could be spied, but one or
two spry milk-carts went rattling by. In despair,
they determined to hail the very next cart and
beg for a lift. It was a furniture van. The ap-
pearance of two smart, well-plumed charmers on
the box-seat with the driver of the van set every
passer-by tittering; and, alas! the van crawled
very slowly up the steep hill. Carriages, dog-
carts, hansoms passed the girls, and their final
descent near the gates caused a big grin along the
lines of the‘coachies.’ The guests grinned even
more broadly, but the girls stood the chaff de-
fiantly.
“The Syme and Mackinnon clans spread out
more and more in chiffon circles every day.
Their number at the Wrixon party was appalling.
The recently-arrived wife of Geoffrey Syme is the
fairest member of the big clan. She is ‘quite
English, you know,’ young, petite, pleasant-look-
ing, with taste in frocking, and a manner. At
this affair she wore an uncommon black silky
dress, with blue embossed flowers sprinkled
thereon. A well-considered toque went with it.
Geoffrey is back on the Age staff.
“ Senator Drake, who at social junkets walks
softly, looks sweetly, and says nothing, in the
manner prescribed by the blithesome.' Beatrice’
to her Benedick, held high festival with, his wife
last Sunday, over his Federal baby’s christening.
The Bananaland Minister unloaded official Atlas
burdens from his much-taxed shoulders, stowed
his playful pince-nez into a vest pocket, brushed
up his brown, gingery locks and mo., and worked
up a party smile. He is very proud of that son’s
arrival under the Federal Flag. He is to be a
wonderful little Australian native. Mrs. Drake
is a stout, fussy lady, with definite ideas of
Senatorial prestige. In the Federal House they
hold the Postmaster General to be a sincere and
earnest soul, but his soft-walking, unctuous man-
ner and velvety voice give him a Pecksniffian air
at which outsiders guffaw prodigiously.
“ The cards for tne State reception (postponed
sine die) were without gilt lettering or expensive
flourishes, but plain black-and-white pasteboards.
Lady Silverlocks puts on no side, and she tells
society cronies that they are not millionaires at
‘ Stonington.’ Captain Vallange does not look too
happy in his role of Private Secretary. His duties
keep him busy, and his pretty wife has not the
chance to be in his company these days.
“ The last raid of the ‘ Thirty Thieves ’ suffered
from chill in more senses than one. Jack Frost
got in his tentacles, and, few as the spectators
were to begin with, some of them went shivering
away before the end of the show. Dorothy Yane
(Mrs. Norman Menzies), in frilly white, laughed
at Lauri’s freaks, but apparently took little joy in
Josephine Stanton’s nasalisms. No theatre busi
ness is brisk at time of writing. Only confirmed
* nobodies * venture to junket in public during the
King’s illness.
“ ‘ Thirty Thieves * were not removed from the
Princess’ a day too soon. May Beatty’s frocks
were showing the strain of active service and the
spry Lauri’s careless treatment, in a way that was
alarming. Half the tinsel was danced off May’s
brief frock. Some of the chiffon punctuations
were missing from her circular skirt towards the
last nights, and May’s plump shoulders were pro-
truding further and further above the circum-
spection-limit—so much so, indeed, that a hand-
kerchief was used as a safeguard against accidents
to the low-cut bodice when May got going in a
dance with Lauri.
“ The Mayoral hop, at Prahran on Friday night,
attracted 1200 guests, after shaking hands with
whom the perspiring Mayor ambled off to the un-
dressing room and shed his robes of office. There-
after he had to depend on a municipal halo to
mark his hostly head. The two most diamonded
dames among the guests were Treasurer Turner’s
cheerful partner and Mrs. A. H. Payne—the
shapely skating champion of smart circles. Lady
Turners black, outstanding, heavy silk gown had
honeycombs of ivory applique at intervals around
the trained skirt. The Federal Treasurer, sprucer
than he has been seen for a long time, almost
waxed jovial as the evening advanced.
Yours affectionately,
AKENEHI.

“ Brother ” King O’Malley’s imitation
Yankee spread-eagleism is getting a bit tiresome
in the House of Reps., and the Man with the

The Mac Patorson, of Queensland, who
howled with rage when the Loan Bill was so
coldly received in the House of Representatives,
assured that body that all the talk of Australia
having over-borrowed was folly, because “but a
few years ago there were people in Europe pre-
pared to take over the whole debt of Australia in

“ Hear, hear! ” Four common delusions in Aus-
tralia are (1) that there is somebody somewhere
who will give a fabulous sum for a million used
penny stamps; (2) That jewellers want to buy
cigar ash at a guinea an ounce ; (3) That if you
find a man hanging you mustn’t cut him down
till the police (who may be 10 miles away) arrive ;
(4) That there is, or was, somewhere in Europe, a
great syndicate ready to pay £207,000,000 for a
railway system which returns barely £4,000,000 a
year—in other words, which wants, or wanted, to
investa stupendous sum of money at 2 per cent,
when it could get nearly 3£ per cent, by buying
up our Government bonds, and have the security
not only of the railways but of the whole Aus-
tralian nation as well. Mac Paterson, of Queens-
land, seems to really believe in that syndicate.
Probably he also collects cigar ash with a view to
selling it to a jeweller some day at 21s. per ounce,
and wouldn’t cut Philp down till the police came,
if he found Philp hanging up.

cognition of her great services to the R.C.
Church.” Of late R. C. Baker himself has been
fast losing his social dash and cultivating an air
of ponderous meditation as if he too were in train-
ing for an ecclesiastical title.
Ballarat’s old Bishop, Dr. Thornton, now
vicar of Blackburn, Eng., on a better salary than
he was able to gather in Australia, is keeping up
his old name as a fighter. The C.E. Temperance
Society and he are in “holts” over the question
of a drink or two, the bishop, as most Australians
know, inclining to a glass if the liquor be good.
LorcbHopetoun has scored a marquisate
because (presumably) of his entertainment of the
Prince of Wales in Australia. And he wanted
Australia to pay for getting him the step-up in
the peerage ! Had he remained in England the
marquisate would have only come through extreme
good luck and the expenditure of tons of money.
E. W. Owe Sullivan is being badgered in
N.S.W. Parliament as to the reply from Lord
Rosebery to his letter asking for the money to
build the proposed “ Australia Facing the Dawn ”
Statue out of Rhodes’ bequests. It is safe to say
that the O’Sullivan will not rush into print with
the answer, as he did with his silly letter embody-
ing the request.
Premier Seddon, it appears, has several
big business undertakings on hand which will
engage what share of his attention he can spare
from running the Empire in London. The chief
is a big West Coast coal-mining venture. Politics
and the uplifting of the masses don’t absorb all of
Mr. Seddon’s energies by any means. Hence he
is by no means lean financially.
Recorded that the King’s first words upon
recovering consciousness after the operation were :
“ Will ray people ever forgive me?” The King’s
Australian subjects will forgive him everything if
he gets well. They don’t hanker after a king like
George of York, whose visit to these parts was
one of the direst calamities which ever happened
to Monarchism south of the equator.
Like so many others, the able, affectionate
and domesticated Primate Cowie (M.L.) has
passed away just as he had entered his name for a
rest and trip to his native England. He was born
there in 1831, was army chaplain for a while (he
was decorated for really gallant services in the
Indian Mutiny), and consecrated Bishop of Auck-
land in 1869. Heart disease suddenly closed his
career.
One of Australia’s greatest artists is the
picture-restorer at N.S.W. National Gallery. In
doctoring many of the best and most expensive
paintings, which seemed cracked and disfigured
beyond repair, lie has done the work of a wizard.
What a splendid trttasformation, for instance, has
he made in the aspect assumed in late years by
Jean Robie’s beautiful still-life canvas, alike the
envy and the despair of all who paint flowers,
metal and shells!
Barton, who has accepted a G.C.M.G., as
head of the Commonwealth, would have been dis-
tinguished as “Mr.,” as compared with “Sir”
See and other Premiers ; later, if lie became Chief
Justice of the Commonwealth, the “Mr.” would
be again a favorable comparison with the Sir
Maddens, Ways, and others. But the Common-
wealth is, so far as Barton is concerned, just
going to be a seventh Australian State.
Recent joke by a Northern naturalist,
who had christened a new venomous snake after
the Federal Premier :
I make no apology, and expect neither favor nor cen-
sure, for dedicating this new and unique ophidian to the
Bight Hon. Edmund Barton, Prime Minister of the
Commonwealth of Australia.
If somebody would only christen a new crab after
a certain stout politician—Democracy would thank
him sincerely.
“Mr. Chamberlain has planned for him-
self a visit to several parts of the Empire, includ
ing Maoriland and Australia.” J. Brum, had better
stay away. He would be a severe disappointment
to Australia, which does not kfiow him as a small,
mean-looking, foxy man, like the partner who
does all the nasty business in a cheap law-firm.
And yet this is an accurate description of the real
Chamberlain, who has the uneasy air of a man in
momentary expectation of being kicked from
behind.
Curious that John Morley, the noblest
“pro-Boer” of them all, is the only politician
raised to the new Order of Merit—an order which
is evidently to be given, not for toadyism, but for
merit. There can now remain (after the precise
definition of this order) no shadow of an idea that
there is any “merit” about a K.C M.G.—which
is, in a sense, compensation for the thought that
it is, at root, impudence for any mere hereditary
monarch to patronise John Morley with a dis-
tinction.
Only one Western (N.S.W.) station has,
it seems, been held from first to last by the same
family. This is Netley, on the lower Darling.
That fine bushman, M‘Kinlay, who afterwards
crossed the continent in search of Burke and
Wills (who weren’t fine bushmen), partnered Joe
Dunne in taking up a block of country as big as
their native Ireland. Later on they cut it up,
Dunne taking Netley ; and with the Dunne

family it still remains. They have always been
grafters (a younger son of a younger brother still
manages it) ; and that accounts for several things.
M‘KLinlay’s connection with the country seems to
have ended close upon half-a-century ago.
Rhodes’ bequests seem to have had a
curious evolution: —
He made six wills. The first, made in 1877, bequeathed
all his estates to the Sec. of State for the Colonies for
the time being, and the Attorney-General for the pro-
vince of Griqualand West. This was revoked in ’B2, when
he bequeathed his wealth to a young man named
Pickering, employed in the De Beers mine. After Picker-
ing’s death, in ’BB, he made a third will. Making pro-
vision for his brothers and sisters, he left the whole of
the residue to a financial friend. In ’9l a fourth will was
made, leaving the personal estate to the same friend and
Mr. Stead. The fifth will, in ’92, appointed the same
financial friend, Mr. Hawkesley, and Mr. Stead sole
executors and joint heirs of Mr. Rhodes’ fortune. It was
in January, ’95, that Mr. Rhodes first announced his
intention to found scholarships. It was in July, ’99, that
Mr. Rhodes revoked his will of ’9l, and substituted what
is now known as his last will and testament.

Almost the only Laborite in the House of
Reps, who owns up both to smoking and to
“ taking stimulants ” is Rev. J. B. Ronald.
Members of the party who have sworn off
both include Brown (who would probably
have learned better if he had gone right
through his course for the kirk as Brother
Ronald did), Hughes, McDonald, the
O’Malley, Page (Page but recently kept a
pub in the bush) and Thomas. Of all the
Ministers in the Reps., now that Barton
and Forrest are away, only long Lyne
smokes.
Much wonder is expressed by poli-
ticians this side of the water at the
speed with which Maoriland Agent-
General Reeves gets the tip as to
important official matters in London.
Reeves was again ahead with the news
of peace, and enabled Treasurer Ward
to first inform even the Gov.-General.
It is asserted that Reeves must have
secret-service money at his disposal, but
the plain fact of the matter seems to be
that he is a young man, doesn’t whisky
as much as some of his colleagues, and
owes a lot to his early press training.
to The Bulletin, from
London:—
Saw Rosebery, at a sale at Christie’s, t’other day. How
scandalously and audaciously the illustrated papers do
“ kid ” the public ! To look at the London News pictures
of kings or peers, you would think they were all 7ft. high.
Rosebery is a small, rather spare man, grey-haired, with
a soft pink face, appealing blue eyes- almost as light as
blind-blue—and splay-red lips. The youthful rose-bloom
of complexion with his grey hair is so soft as to be un-
manly. What an asylum for the blind mediocrity this
England is, when a soft prattler like Rosebery—a one-
eyed man—is regarded as the only hope of Liberalism !
The newly-knighted lawyer Rutledge, the
ex-parson and various politician, kept a title-foot
first in most of his doings of late years. Speaking
at the farewell dinner tendered to Lord Laming-
ton, Mr. Rutledge expressed a fervent hope that
his Lordship’s successor would be nothing less
distinguished than a “British nobleman.”
Rutledge has now begun to be a British nobleman
in his own eyes, and no doubt thinks the fact will
help him to the coveted first seat on Q. Supreme
Court Bench.
“ Van D.” : Re stories of old-school Tas-
manian clergymen. In my native district we had
a pastor who, I was assured by an old schoolmate
of his and of Thackeray’s, was the original of Chas.
Honeyman in “Pendennis.” He was a most
eloquent man, but having been in his early days
a free liver, he had been relegated to the country
parish where I first knew him. He sang a good
song, told a good story, and smoked a good smoke.
On one occasion I was present at the consecration
of a church, and at a “ spread ” after the cere-
mony, our minister —much to the horror of his
Bishop and reverend brothers—volunteered a
song, and, despite coldly repressive glances, sang
“The Coronation” from the Ingoldsby Legends.
Only much influence saved the old man’s gown.
George M‘Culloch, who was manager of
Mt. Gipps sheep-run when Broken Hill was
found on it, and who was for many years,
if he isn’t still, the largest shareholder,
has, during the last 10 years, put over
a quarter-of-a-million into pictures.
His galleries, which now hold one of
the finest private collections in Eng-
land, are at Kensington. And yet
in the Barrier’s early days Mr.
M‘Culloch was summed-up as the
roughest and ruggedest of all the
west country sheep and cattle men;
and, curiously enough, so up-ended
do things come out of the bag,
none of them put up a harder fight
against the interloping prospectors
than he. But he forgave them ;
and he didn’t leave the Barrier till
he had made a handsome gift to
the local miners’ hospital—which
is more than any other of the Aus-
tralian millionaires has done.
Maoriland King Seddon
while in Britain saw to it that
Captain Haw-Haw Russell, of
Hawkes Bay, one-time leader of
the Opposition, wool-king, director
of the Northern Investment Co.
and other things, was knighted. The per
sonage always described in the local prints as “ the
Gallant Captain ” has waited long for a bauble,
and although he imports everything, down to his
shirts and socks, direct from England, and is
about times more English than Joe Chamber-
lain himself, that bauble was long in coming.
Premier George Leake, of Westralia, died
in harness a few days ago. He was by descent a
’Groper of the ’Gropers. His father, George
Walpole Leake, was a Westralian M.L.C. in his
latter days, but held ten different State billets
between 1857 and 1890. As a curious instance of
the upside-downness of things Westralian, he was
promoted from being Acting Chief-Justice in 1880
to the billet of police-magistrate in ’Bl ! The
deceased Premier’s uncle, Luke Leake, was a
Westralian knight, M.L.C., Speaker, and other
things. George Leake’s first and only portfolio was
that of Premier. He didn’t graduate through any of
the subordinate offices. His first Ministry lasted
six months (May to Nov., 1901), His second, after
he had blown the trivial Morgans out of his road,
started at the end of Dec., 1901, and also lasted
six months, till his death. His colleagues were
men like himself who had never held office before.
He assumed power with a slender majority, when
the State was burdened with the huge debt heaped
up by Bigjohn Forrest, and the dead weight of
the Groper traditions were all against him.
Nevertheless, he was the best democrat that
Westralia has ever grown on its own soil; and he
did much good work. With more time, more
experience, and with more experienced col-
leagues he might have done much more. He was

ness of building railways except by means of

of Leake’s death—a treacherous disease, in which

times and then die on the 17th relapse. He was

The United Typewriter and Supplies Co.,
one of the largest concerns manufacturing type-
writers, seems to be getting more of its share of
the world’s business. One of its machines, the
“Yost,” was favoured recently by the Indian
Government with an order for one hundred and
twenty machines. In addition to this their
Austrian representative now reports the sale of
five hundred “ New Century ” Typewriters for use
on the Government Railways. An important
fact is that these two are record orders for the
world, and, what is more important in the eyes of
the Company, were obtained in competition with
all the leading makes. Australian buyers can
obtain both of these machines from the Company’s

THE “ COLD SNAP ” IN MELBOURNE.
YARRABANKER : “Say, mister, would yer let a
cove in ter warm hisself?”
Such is greatness. A N.S.W. member of
the Federal House of Reps., who has been making
stirring speeches -on the fodder duties, recently
visited an outlying part of his pastoral electorate,
where the local publican and policeman quickly
gathered round the great man. Wishing to test
the impression his speeches had made, “Do any
of you fellows about here ever get Hansard ? ” he
asked. Boniface thought a moment; then his face
illuminated :—“Jack Flanagan’s damn bad, and
we don’t know what’s the matter with him ;
perhaps he's got it! ”

“ Mungana ” : Travelling has lately been
reduced to a science in N.Q. T’other day a
married man left Redcap, carrying a small water-
bag. Next day his family (which comprised a
wife and five children) also left. The only dif-
ference was that the wife and family all had bluey
up; the eldest lad, about 10, staggered under a
drum fit for any old whaler, while another game
little pebble, apparently not more than seven
summers, bent beneath the weight of the family
bedding. The woman—Heaven pity her!—had a
child at the breast, and seemed to be suffering
from sandy blight.
“Vinter”: Met a female “swaggie,” when
making through the bush, near Seymour (Vic.).
She was quite 70, and carried a fair-sized bluey
and a billy. She had been on the tramp for three
days, looking for work —washing, scrubbing, sew-
ing, cooking, milking, or anything else that might
offer. “But,” she said, “it’s hard fora body to
get work these times. The d d men are doin’
women’s work at tuppence a day hereabout.”

“J.C.H.” : J. D. Moore (8., 24/5/’O2) was
far at sea in writing that the Kenniffs could
make “further down the Diainantina, from there
to the Roper, and camp with the buffalo-shooters,
mostly nomads.” The shortest cut, through the
bush, from Diamantina to Roper, can’t be less
than 800 miles, and there are no buffalo-shooters
on the Roper. Further, I defy J. D. Moore to
name one buffalo-shooter in the N.T. that is
wanted by the police. I had 19 years N.T. ex-
perience, and know what I’m talking about.

“F.M.”: Australian squatters are dull
men, except at cutting down shearers’ wages and
travellers’ rations. Butler, a farmer of Walgett,
ploughs 200 acres of land, uses bore-water, and
harvests 400 tons of hay. (He could put down
2000 tons of ensilage at less cost). Hay, squatter,
Collindina (Murray River), ploughs sand-ridges
and light-red soil, tows lucerne, and trebles the
carrying-capacity of his run. Yet the water from
500 bores runs mostly to waste, while a thousand
sure sites are untapped ; and of 10,000 sq. miles of
country in E. Riverina not 10 are ploughed and
sown.

Johnson hadn’t long been transferred to
the Bank of Reconstruction’s Possum ton branch
when his fellow clerks noticed something peculiar
about him. “ Have you observed that diabolical
Btare he transfixes you with out of his left
eye ? ” said the teller to the accountant.
“Rather,” said the latter. “Why, I was
making up Jumbuek’s overdraft yesterday,
and felt something paralyse me so that I
forgot to charge interest. It was John-
son’s eye going through me like a gimlet.”
Johnson turned up a bit late one morning,
and the teller noticed something wrong.
“ Where’s your eye ?” he shrieked. John-
son put his hand up, felt an empty socket,
and rushed excitedly out. He’d forgotten
to replace the glass eye, which he’d taken
out on going to roost the previous night.
So he rushed to the hotel and climbed
up to his attic. The girl was cleaning it
out. “Di-id you see a —a round piece of
glass,” he stammered. “ D’yer mean yer
eye?” said she. “Well, I seen little Jimmy
playin’ wid somethin’ that might ’er been a
glass eye.” Johnson hurled himself down-
stairs, bounded into the yard, pounced on
Jimmy, who was spinning a top, and shook
him till his heels rattled against his teeth.
“ What d’yer do with that round piece o’
glass you took out of my room ?|” he de-
manded. The youngster whimpered. “I
I swopped it f-f-or this ’ere top,” he said.
“Who to? Tell me quick or I’ll murder
you.” “To-ommy Smith.” “Take me to
him.” So they went and found Tommy.
He had swopped it for a hoop to Billy
Jones. Billy had sold it for a penny to
Sandy MTherson. Sandy had bargained
it for a white rat to Paddy O’Brien, and
Paddy had dropped it in the river on his
way to school. Johnson turned up at the
bank a bit later with a black patch over his
left eye, and the spell was lifted. After the
overdraft closed for the night he went
trawling in the river for his optic, but
though he got an eel and a kerosene-tin,
the great deep refused to give up John-
son’s eye.
“Traveller”: Sheep are valuable these
days; 5000 wethers were travelled down from
Lake Victoria station to Morgan to be trucked to
the interior, and, owing to food-scarcity on the
road, owner had to truck hay from Adelaide to
Morgan, and have it carted and spread out for
last 30 miles of the journey. Then the mob were
spelled for two days at Morgan, and fed on hay
to put them in buckle for the rail trip.

“ X.Y.Z.” writes from Cobar :
Ever hear of a case like this ? At about 8.30 p.m. a
flock of ducks were flying over the house, and evidently
mistook the iron roof for water, so flopped down on to it
with a great noise. Some fell to the ground, others were
caught in the guttering, but eventually all flew away.
Only 123 points of rain here since Sept. Ist, 1901, nearly
10 months ! How is that for dry ?
“ Cyniphilos ” : If the fine verses, “The
Drover’s Toast,” in B. 24/5/’O2, really come from a
drover, he must be a very exceptional one, because
m the course ot mucn obser-
vation I have not found any
other set of men so cruel
to their dogs. The way
an average musterer treats
the faithful animal by
whose intelligence and
willingness he lives _ is
simply horrible. Quite
common to see a hulk-
ing brute of a man
with his foot on the
neck of his faithful
servitor, thrashing
the poor beast with
a heavy stick. I have
rarely met a drover
who did not believe
in punishment in
that form. An ex-
ception was a man
who said that no
good ever came of
it, and strongly re-
commended his
little method of
suspending the dog
for 24 hours by its
chain to the side
of the whare, just
letting the hind
feet touch the
ground. Have
heard, when in
camp, a drover,
who had just pol-
ished off half-a-dozen
chops, exclaim to his starving dog
that had approached on the off-chance of a bone :
“Get outl you greedy brute!”—at the
same time administering a cruel kick in the ribs.
To the initiated the “Toast” is “all my eye !”

Lately passed out at Taradale (Vic.) one
Smith, who could give “Uncle Tom” Brassey
points at falling-off. His first big fall was from a
bridge crossing the Coliban at a height of 140 ft.
Whilst working on the structure he slipped and
fell to the bed of the creek beneath. So con-
vinced were his mates of his certain destruction
that they did not go to his assistance, but, in-
stead, went in search of a stretcher, and a bag to
throw over the mangled remains. On reaching
the bottom, however, they found the fallen one
with left arm and leg broken, and cursing them
with much vigor for being so long. Patched up
in the course of a few months, he started work in
one of the local mines, only to tumble down a 20ft.
winze. Arm again broken. Then he took to
doing odd jobs about the townships, and while
engaged painting the stable of one of the local
pubs, slipped and fell to the ground a distance of
sto 6 ft. Picked up unconscious and died a week
later from spinal-paralysis.*

The “ cannibal” tree grows in Australia, and people
are shy of it. It is the shape of a huge pineapple, and
attains a height of lift. It has a series of broad, board-
like leaves, growing in a fringe at the apex, and strong
enough to bear the weight of a man. The instant that a
person touches one of these leaves it flies together like a
trap, crushing the life out of the intruder. Formerly the
natives used it lor executing criminals.

“Via” : Re dogs and bites (“Abo.”
14/9/’l). Ever heard that if attacked by a dog
and you grab his front paws hard that he (or she)
won’t bite ? Tried it myself once some years
back, and it was all right—for the dog : he appre-
ciated the squeezing by taking about 4oz. off my
leg. Know hundreds who believe in the paw-
squeeze theory. I prefer a tree. Also, a St. Bernard,
if kept *on the chain for a month or two, makes
the most savage watchdog ever wanted and a bit
over, as they will tackle friend and foe, and 9st.
of vicious dogs-ineat is a bough proposition in the
small hours.
[All the same, it is a fact that if you grab one of a dog’s
forepaws and squeeze it hard and unflinchingly, he can’t
bite you while you retain the strength and nerve to keep
the squeeze hard on to his digits. Present writer, years
ago, when challenged to uphold the theory, tried it on
with a lfiib. bull-terrier, which did not succeed in biting
him within the specified 2min. Anyone who would see
for himself without risk how the thing works has only to
squeeze the paw of his pet dog. Firstly it will whine,
and gently lick his hand, and beg to be let off ; then it
will squeal ; finally it will try to bite. It may succeed after
a struggle in scratching the back of your hand with its
teeth, but it can’t bite so long as you keep the grip on.]

THE WORK ON FATHER’S MIND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We’ve got three hundred acres, and
There’s forty fairly clear,
But father’s got the lot in hand
And whispers in our ear
Of crops that will be grand to view
In paddocks all outlined—
I wonder when we’ll battle through
The work on father’s mind.
From jackass-laugh to dingo-cry
We’re grubbing giant trees,
And stacking wood that by-and-bye
Will bring us wealth and ease ;
Or else we’re clearing scrub away
That grows again to blind
The bit of crop, and so delay
The work on father’s mind.
He has his burden of the toil,
But reckons when he’s gone,
’Twill be a splendid bit of soil
For us to live upon.
He’s up before the sparrow kin,
And we’re not far behind—
There are eighteen-hour stages in
The work on father’s mind.
So day to day, and year to year,
We slave and slog and grub ;
There’s only forty fairly clear,
The rest is full of scrub.
And if we ever battle through,
I know we’re sure to find
’Tis but an introduction to
The work on father’s mind.

THE PENITENT,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The great Evangelist, who nightly strove
For Temperance and Heaven’s sake,
Had roped the thirstiest, most sinful cove
That ever saw a crimson snake,
And down upon his knees, with woful face,
Went Pete, the penitent, and cried for grace.
Then Brother Yamm was filled with bliss intense,
And o’er the alcoholic Goth
He whooped anew ; with goodly eloquence
He whipped the meeting to a froth.
The women wept, the wondering fellows thought
That in their time a miracle was wrought.
“ My friends,* the glad reformer cried, “ behold
A brand plucked from the burning here,
A wayward lamb returneth to the fold,
No more to drown his soul in beer 1 ”
And on he went for hours, his mellow tones
The lowly “ drunk ” diversified with groans.
But penitence with zeal provokes a heat,
And heat induces thirst in some,
And now, up from the penitential seat,
Pathetic protestations come:
“ Yah 1 sling it, mister. Take a shorter cut,
We shan’t get out afore the pubs are shut I"

“ Theta ” : A curious
natural-history fact is the
complete disappearance of
the dasyurus from Vic.
western district. Trapping
rabbits 15 years ago I used
to catch lmudreds of these
“native cats,” but about
five years since the animal
suddenly disappeared from
that locality, and now there
are large areas in which it
is not to be found at all.
There is still plenty of
cover, and bandicoots and
’possums are still numer-
ous ; but the “cat” has
gone completely, although
it was never systematically
hunted. In fact, trappers
always hated to see a cat
caught ; so the disappear-
ance must have been due
either to an epidemic or to
wholesale migration.
Going down to Mel-
bourne, second-class, a
bushwornan was valiantly
trying to start a conversa-

was a stranger to her. The
man sat back in his corner
with his eyes shut, and a
small trunk beside him
labelled “May.” The bush-
woman glanced shyly at
the bushman and sighed
deeply. Silence. Sheturned
and read the label on the
trunk. “ It’s very ’ot in

gested, after a moment’s

Writes ‘ Shaker from the Far North :
On his inspection tours Dr. Roth (Protector of Q.
Aborigines) labors under the disabilities of royalty,
Were it possible—it isn’t—for him to visit the Peninsula
incog he would have his eyes opened to many things.
N.itbless, the nigs, are not so badly off under the Protec-
tion Act as some people make out. Doubtless, the police
bunt them about a lot, but on the other hand indis-
criminate “dispersions” (official and unofficial) are prac-
cally things of the past. Also, if the police do comman-
deer all the young gins, the latter are thereby saved
from the Ohows and the beastly immoral diggers. The
Govt, ration is certainly scanty, and possibly does not
always reach its destination ; but, as a set off, there are
the diggers’ camps, which can now be looted with im-
punity. Every resident knows that the blacks, as far
north as Ooen, are rotten with disease ; but that is the
resultof the “advance of civilisation.” After all, if things
are just let slide, the trouble will settle itself quietly
within the next 10 or 15 years.

“ Salgy ” : Re catching crows (B. 28/6/02).
I have found the following method very successful
in both N.S.W. and Queensland. Wing a crow
with a gun, and peg the bird, back downwards,
by its wings to the ground. The captive’s out-
cries will soon bring more crows along, and pre-
sently one of these is sure to jump upon the con-
finee, only to be gripped by the latter’s claws and
held as in a vyce, making capture quite easy. The
second prisoner can then in turn be used as a
decoy.
“Mid” - : Re obtaining young crows.
Apart from waiting till the nestlings are feathered
and then felling the tree, I have taken numbers
thus : I have watched the nest until the young
birds appeared on the side, and have then watched
for and shot the parent birds. Then, within a
couple of days, the young birds have been found
at the foot of the tree, having been driven by
hunger to attempt flight when they could only
just do enough in that way to break their fall.

Cassell’s “History of England,” part 67,
is up-to-date enough to deal with Australian
Federation, and well-informed enough to say this:
One important factor was overlooked : The Australian
natives, of whom there are some 20,000 in Victoria alone,
and they were solid for Federation. It was a curious
democratic illustration—an effete, aboriginal community
making its almost foreign voice heard in the babel of the
newer speech that dominated the country.
The A. N. A. “an effete, aboriginal community”
with “ its almost foreign voice ” !
In a south-western electo-
rate an M.L.A., visiting his con-
stituents, struck a bush-pub., and
what sort of a night was it !
The paddock was strewn with
dead-to-the-world men and empty
bottles. At break of day sick
and sorry creatures were seen
moving from every direction to
the bar for a “corpse-reviver”—
and there wasn’t a drop ! The
“missus” stood behind the bar
expostulating with the thirsty
crew. “Gintlemin,” she said,
“it’s no use. There isn’t a taste
ov anythink in th’ house. Ye
drank it all lasht noight, and
Pat had to go to attind on th’
jury at before dayloight,
and hadn’t toime to make a drap
of annythink for yez.”

An employee at one of the
Groulburn Valley (Vic.) vineyards,
an exile of Erin, fell into the
cellar, a distance of 19ft., striking
a crab winch in his fall. When
the other employees ran to gather
up the remains they found the
O’Brien feeling himself tenderly,
and wearing a surprised expres-
sion. He had broken the iron
handle from the crab-winch, but
wasn’t a bit broken himself.
However, he thought he ought
to git a day off “ for the surprise
to the system.”

Some years ago, at Windsor
(N.S.W.), a rifleman missed the
target and the bullet went right
through the billycan' of a traveller
camped some distance dff. The
holes in the billy got the swaggie
many a feed and drink as the
basis for a bush ranging perjury.
It was finally sold to a wayback publican, and
is now doing duty to show what didn’t happen to
a man in S’Africa.
“ Ben Sun ” : Re fire-fighting (“ Bob R”
B. 21/6/02):- S V ’
The watercart would be useless in rough, broken
country ; and, against a bush as distinguished from a
grass-fire, would be utterly ineffective. Further, bags,
bushes, or greenhide beaters are usually available, while
water is seldom so in the bushfire season. Also, if fire-
fighting is “ reduced to a science ” in Riverina, it isn’t
elsewhere. Have never seen a fire fought scientifically,
or even intelligently. Mostly men belt around anyhow,
get “ winded” and half roasted, and only drive the fire
faster. Moreover, when a fire is driven by a strong wind
through heavy grass, leaves and other rubbish, little can
be done, and the only check possible is to burn back from
some existing break. But, given a crowd under control,
an advancing grass-fire can be beaten quickly if the
fighters divide into small gangs, and every two of these
start to burn back at opposing angles towards the coming
fire. If the intervals between the starting points are well
estimated, each gang meets another in time ; the force of
the wind isn’t fully felt; every man is working effectively,
and the checking fire on the forward side can be beaten
out close to the point of ignition all along. But if a
checking fire is carried across the wind it’s pretty sure to
get away. Finally, clubs should be formed and men
taught how to deal with bush-fires, without wasting
energy and endangering life.

The sun-picture on this page is of Mr. Louis

“ Blackbirding ” in the New Hebrides for
Q. sugar plantations is becoming every week more
difficult. The recruiter Roderic Dhu has only
been able to obtain five men in two-months-and-a-
half at Aoba, and then the ship was fired upon by
Kanakas. Last trip of the ltoderio Dhu was
fraught with bloodshed, but the facts were care-
fully suppressed by most of the papers.
Douglas Rannie, Assistant-Inspector of
Polynesians at Bundaberg and Mackay, has been
writing pathetically to the Q. press on the woes
of returned kanakas:
Then what of the children, born in the State, educated
in the State schools, brought up in Sunday schools ;
must these children be banished into the blackness and
darkness and corruption of heathenism? .... I view
with horror, contempt, and disgust those who clamor to
drive these young Christians down to barbarism, &c.
Unfortunately for Mr. Rannie’s pathos, kanaka
children born in the State of Queensland are
British subjects and cannot be forcibly returned
to the Islands But if the heathenism and cor-
ruption of the Islands is worse than the heathenism
and corruption of the Chow dens and brothels
where Tommy Tanna picks up the rudiments of
civilisation, then things in Polynesia are very,
very rotten indeed.
CAPTAIN DUMARESQ, of Longford (Tas.),
who reached his 100th birthday on 10th
Jume, 1902.
Captain Dumaresq, whose portrait is pub-
lished in this issue, is perhaps the only absolutely
authentic centenarian in the Commonwealth. He
was 100 on. June 10, has a son aged 63 in the Tas-
manian Parliament, and a brother (now dead) was
made a colonel by Wellington on the field of
Waterloo.
Possibly it is only that unconscious
humorist, the cable-man, who is responsible for
this:
The Kaiser has issued ordfers regulating the marriages
of army officers. The officers, it is decreed, must have a
private income of at least £l5O per annum. They must
give a full description of their intended wives.
The German officer, according to this, must give a
full description of the lady before marriage. It
seems a very large order, and it doesn’t seem quite
respectable.
The popular definition of a “ lady ”
becomes very hard to arrive at. The other day a
tall, handsome girl of 18 indignantly repudiated
the charge of vagrancy thrown at her in a Mel-
bourne police court on the ground that “ she was
a lady and was being kept by a Chinaman.”
Governor Tennyson perpetrated a fresh
stanza for “Gor Save” in Adelaide the other
day:—
Lord God show forth Thy power,
And guard his every hour,
God save the King.
Clothe him with righteousness,
Crown him with happiness,
God, with thy blessings bless and save the King.

The Office-Boy’s Nightmare.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The office-boy was weary,
So laid him down to rest;
Then came his troubles dreary,
And sat upon his chest—
“ A ” shelves, “ B ” shelves, pigeon-holes and files,
Throwing out their pockets, shedding manu-
scripts,
Cartoons, book-plates, ’graving blocks in piles,
;Careering round and round him with fantas- .
tic
skips.
Around him danced cotillions —
A regiment of books,
». And out of them, in millions,
Trooped with laughing looks—
Long scraps, short scraps, scraps of every hue,
Dropping tracts around him, sowing seeds of sin,
Love-scraps, war-scraps, lying scraps and true,
Yelling out their secrets with Hell’s
own
din.
The office-basket grumbled
In Editorial style,
And out of him there tumbled
Effusions by the mile—
Long pomes, short pomes, pomes of every sort,
Shedding tears around him, venting music sweet,
Love-yarns, snake-yarns, tragedy and sport,
Telling him their troubles with a mourn-
ful
bleat.
Then brooms began to muster,
* nd scissorses to grind,
The paper knife and duster,
And God knows behind—
Paste-pots, ink-pots, pots of every Size,
Putting on the war-paint, putting on the jam,
Square brush, round brush —dab him in the eyes,
And the “ office-boy ” arises with a great
big
Dam.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Protection means independence, Freetrade
dependence.
Tf the A.N.A. wants to justify its name
it should make a rule that members must give
preference in all things to goods of Australian
production.
Trenwith intended on a recent Sunday in
Melbourne to discourse upon the suggestive
theme of “A Modern Ananias, the War burton
Railway job, and other things,” but the Age and
the Argus declined to advertise the text. Now
why ?
There will soon be no rank-and-file of the
Freetrade-and -Geebung crowd out of a billet.
Both the N.S.W. State and the Federal Govts,
are filling every appointment from their ranks—
presumably to ensure the Opposition plenty of
funds for next election.
N.S.W. Government proposes borrowing
£1,000,000 for water-conservation, drainage, and
sundries. And if this expenditure adds £lOO,OOO
a year to the land revenue, that will be spent
cheerily as the Owe Sullivan goes along, and the
£1,000,000 debt will remain for ever, as a matter
of course.
The man who takes over the Premiership
as George Leake’s successor (probably Walter
James) will be the fifth Premier Westraliahas had
inside 17 months. John Forrest, the mightiest
borrower of them all, held on for over ten years,
but the men who have to face the bill after the
great borrower is gone have a precarious billet.
Premier See says he is going to establish
a comprehensive Local Government system in
N.S.W. Meanwhile Sydney has had local
Government for over half a century, and after all
that period we still find Daley, M.L.A., with a
notice on the Assembly’s business paper demand-
ing that the Government shall repair some street
or other at Dawes Point!
The new Transcontinental Land Grab
Railway movement in S. Australia wants watch-
ing. A very strong local crowd has been got into
the swim—and Kingston, who once kicked a shark
downstairs for making a cheeky proposal of this
sort, is out of the way. Of course the Register
approves; and Advertiser Bonython has been
elected first vice-president, so the wobbly patriot
has presumably been fastened down too. Oppo-
sition-leader John Darling is on the executive,
and the Fat of the land is all something or other
in the big game.
The stopgap, divided Government will pro-
bably remain in power in Victoria until the end
of the session. The Factories Act exercises a
mighty influence. If not re-enacted before the
end of the session, it is a dead letter—falls abso-'
lutely from the statute book —and the Labor-
party is prepared to keep conservative Irvine in
power on the understanding that he re-enacts the
measure without delay. The Factories Act, also,
is Peacock’s one ewe-lamb, and sooner than sacri-
fice it he would vote with the Govt, against his
own want-of-confidence motion.
S.A. Govt, lately wanted to buy land at
Port Adelaide to extend its big produce-depot.
The owners, the wealthy absentee S.A. Co. of
London, who had originally paid 12s. 6d. for it,
coolly asked £750 per acre ! The land was still in
its natural state when Kingston was S.A. Premier.
The S.A. Co. was founded by George Fife Angus
as a philanthropic institution in 1837.
The same crowd that worked the S'African
press just before the war is trying its hand
once more, this time to get the Cape Con-
stitution suspended. Nobody expounds the
majority’s view; the blatant minority is having
all the say—and it must be a minority ; a majority
could do as it thought fit, without any suspension,
or it could suspend the Constitution itself.
The best part of a year has elapsed since
Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania, and S.A. were
relieved of a considerable burden of taxation by
the abolition of the inter-State duties, and only
now have two of them made their first attempt at
raising a little extra revenue to make good the
loss. The other two have done nothing. And all
four have moaned bitterly because, while paying
less taxes, they have not had so much revenue.
Kingston never showed himself so dis-
tinctly the fighting man of the Ministry as in the
debate on the Bonus Bill. It was by sheer per-
severance and deadly earnestness and force of
character that he drove the Bill past the critical
second reading division, and though it was practi-
cally wrecked in committee after all, he fought it
to the last with a courage that deserved better
fortune. All the other members of the_
put together have about half C.C.K.’s grit. /
Statistics read by Mr. S. G. Martin before
Brisbane Royal Society show that the mortality
of the Polynesians in Queensland during five
quinquennial periods was (per thousand) 74, 102,
75, 51 and 36. The lowest rate was that for the
period 1895-99. The rate for the European popu-
lation of the ages of the Kanakas (15 to 45), is 8 per
1000. One-half the deaths amongst the islanders
are due to tubercular diseases; and pneumonia and
dysentery are other great causes of mortality.
Hall-Jones, the funereal blow-pipe of the
Seddon Government, appeared in the pulpit of
Scots Church, Wellington, on a recent Sunday
when a thanksgiving service was held in honor of
the church-yard peace in S’Africa. Among other
things, Hall-Jones eulogised the Boers as brave,
honorable and sturdy foemen, “ well worthy of
our steel, &e.”; whereat it has been pointed out
that the Government is no longer a one-man
affair, since one of Seddon’s colleagues dares to
differ from “the boss.” “Treacherous,”’“un-
generous,” “ unscrupulous ” are some of the
mildest epithets that Gory Dick has applied to-the
men whom the Jingoes now try to palaver with
soapy epithets. Perhaps when the Mighty
Bounder comes back he will consider the oase of
Hall-Jones.
AT THE PRESS CLUB.
MR. PRATTLE : "Hullo, Baldy, you look da[?]ful.
What’s up?”
MR. BALDWIN : “ Got the sack from the Daily
Austral. I was doing the cricket-cables and
only made two columns out of a 10-word
message.”
Edmund Barton (who up-to-date is making
a braver show in London than his best friends
hoped for):
With regard to the suspension of the Cape Constitu-
tion, he could only say, without attempting to trench
upon the domestic concerns of Cape Colony, that once
free institutions had been given to a people, their sus-
pension for even one day would be a dangerous experi-
ment, only to be undertaken when there was a certainty
that no other course would succeed.
The matter is one on which an Australian Premier
may well speak ; if one colonial constitution may
be suspended so may another.
When Hughes, of N.S.W. , drew the atten-
tion of the Representatives to the fact that Aus
tralasia had in 29 years borrowed, °n account oj
the State and local bodies, close on £200,000,000
and had onlyreceived £28,000,000, the rest having
gone back in interest and charges, M Mdian put
m the bright remark, “ Haven t we got the assets
created By the money?” So we have-bamng
those that are worn-out or obsolete, and saying
nothing of the fact that a great deal of tne
money was never represented by assets.
But the sorrowful fact is that if the
money paid in interest had instead been
paid to a Public Works Fund we
might have practically all these
assets and have no debt at all.
And as we can’t undo the past
the right thing is to start on a
non - borrowing basis now and
keep on it for the future.
It appears by cable that
Premier Seddon has been doing
a very extra whoop indeed in
London about his own desire
and the desire of Maoriland to
give a trade preference to the
“ Motherland.” And yet, sad
to say, things get no “ forrader.”
Britain admits most Maoriland
produce in free, and the Govern-
ment the Gasbag
charging duties on
Britan produce which are the
heaviest in the world, bar, per-
haps, the rates of Canada and
the United States. Britain buys
about £10,000,000 worth of goods
in a year from Maoriland, and Dick’s
State only buys about £6,000,000 worth in
return. Compared with the wide liberality
of Germany, Britain’s best customer, whose
anti-British tariff is much lighter than that of
Maoriland, and which buys from Britain about
£7,000,000 more per annum than Britain buys
from her, the bitter hostility which Seddon’s
Government shows against British industries in
practice looks very bad. Certainly it doesn’t at
all square with Richard of Kumara’s theories.
Premier See’s latest is that, “if time
permits, he intends this season to grapple seri-
ously with the question of Local Government ” in
N.S.W. But time never permits to grapple seri-
ously with the question, which is left mouldering
at the tail-end of the notice-paper. And time
always permits to grapple with the question
that is taken first. If John See is going to
tackle the Local Government problem as soon as
everything else is finished it has a beautiful show.
S.M. Herald would compass sea and land
to get one gird at the Labor Party. On the
A.W.U. rule which fines a member £3 if he votes
or works against the union candidate, it says:
“ The position of M’s.P. who take the solidarity
pledge is much the same in principle. They are
not fined £3, but they are menaced with the loss
of their seats.” And since Party Government
began wasn’t any member of any party subject to
the same menace ? A crooked vote meant death
at next election, and nobody thought of mention-
ing coercion in that connection.
It seems to have been possible for any
Tom, Dick, or Harry in Vie. public service to get
hold of a frank stamp, and send his letters and
bundles through the post on the nod. Minister
Drake’s recent investigations have brought to light
a set of false teeth sent through O.H.M.S. by an
M. Another even sent his love-letters “On
His Majesty’s Service.” He was “ paying his
addresses ” without paying. The Vic. Govt,
simply printed O.H.M.S. envelopes and wrappers,
and sent them round according to the dictates of
whim and fancy. Australia needs to learn that
eternal vigilance is the price of economy.
Someone should be brought to book over
the muddling of N.S.W. Statutes consolidation.
G. C. Heydon, when a practising barrister, pro-
posed to consolidate them without fee, but with
“a- small amount of paid service.” He was
allowed to start. After some time hitches arose.
G. H. Reid, then Premier, quashed the enterprise.
But Mr. Want revived it, and as Attorney-
General, appointed a staff of junior barristers at
something like £3OO a year each. Cutting and
pasting have been going on since. In salaries
alone over £lO,OOO has been consumed ; other ex-
penses run the sum up, it is estimated, to £20,000.
A Cocky to The Bulletin :
Re your remarks (28/6/’o'2) on the presidentship of the
N. Farmers and Settlers’ Association as a probable
step to an M.L.0.-ship : Is everybody in this crawlsome
country merely a servile solicitor for a bauble of some
kind? The illiterate bush-person “enthuses” over the
bush “ mimber ” because he scents a J.P.-ship, and the
Premier of a State slobbers “ Joe ” for a knighthood—it’s
simply awful! Shouldn’t the honor of being the head of
a large organisation working for the common welfare of
its members be sufficient for anyone? Evidently not.
The Farmer’s Ass. is in a tight place now. It is cordially
hated by the Govt, and despised by its own class, and
nothing can pull it through but a strong masterful farmer
(not a “ strange combination ”), a man prepared to deal
stoush out to the political curse when it obtrudes itse f—
in fact a farmer-enthusiast. The Ass. can gain nothing
by electing a place hunter or a hybrid creature.
Though the evidence given by Tas. em-
ployers before the recently-touring Vic. Shops
and Factories Commission was violently anti-
labor, it must not be supposed that said employers
are making a big profit out %>f sweated labor.
Barring a few clothing mills and the jam factories,
wherein child-labor is largely availed of, there is
little actual sweating in the Isle of Dreams.
Wages are wretchedly low, of course, but the
workers are not yet numerous enough to be suc-
cessfully run against each other in the cockpits
of machine-made competition, as in larger centre
like Sydney and Melbourne. Successful sweating
THE BOSS OF THE LOT.
“ Now, if you had to be some kind of animal
what sort would you be?”
“Oh, I don’t know! I suppose a man.”
requires a waiting army of unemployed round the
factory door. In Tas. the unemployed doesn’t
wait; he mostly drifts to the mainland.
A N.S.W. Govt, officer of experience on
day labor :
Day labor is right enough. In theory it is the right
thing ; hut it’s terribly handicapped. In this respect
Labor’s friends are its worst enemies. You’d think the
Labor party would have enough horse-sense to give the
thing a fair show ; but they haven’t. They expect all
their constituents to be employed by O’Sullivan. All
their friends’ friends who are incompetent to do anything
else are thought good enough for us. Well, as for me,
when a man comes with a note from a Minister to be
put on at once, he’s not put on at once ; if he is put on,
he is not kept on if he’s a duffer. I’m up to my
neck now because I sacked two of ’s nominees, and
won’t put them back. Much of this, and your billet is
not worth keeping. We get no thanks for kicking up the
dust, so most of us let it go, and our estimates go, too.
If day labor ever goes overboard, it’s the M’s.L.A.. chiefly
the Labor men, too, who will be to blame.
Labouchere in London Troth od the
Hopetoun question:
I entirely approve of the action of the Australian
Parliament. The president of the U.S. receives £lO,OOO
per annum. Our ambassadors abroad receive, on an
average, about £BOOO per annum. I presume that the
idea of the Australians is that they wish their Governor-
General to live in the style of the chief executive officer
of a Commonwealth, and that they think that what is
enough for the American President is enough for him.
We are told that they will not get good men for the
money. I could find, them plenty of excellent men who
would gladly accept the position at the price. ... If I
were an Australian, I should insist on my Governor-
General being an Australian ; in fact, I should favor his
being elected to the position by Australians. The unity
of the Empire under one sovereign might be secured by
the King personally ratifying the selection, although this
would be a mere form, as is the Sovereign’s approval of
the choice of a Speaker by the Commons.
In view of the looming Victorian dencit,
the long, loose, rambling Shiels says his only
remedy is to sit tight on the Treasury chest. But
that won’t meet the difficulty. Since Victoria
has lost its border customs, and since the Federal
tariff has been so violently cut down by the push
to which its own Sargood belongs, more revenue
is imperative. The sitting-tight process, when
carried beyond a certain point, consists in letting
schools go out of repair, in letting railways go to
seed till they are dangerous to travel on, in letting
everything run down —and then floating a big
loan for repairs. And that is dry rot —not
economy. Victoria is already more cheaply
governed by far than England is in peace time,
though it pays old age pensions and England
doesn’t. The tightness on the chest has already
gone about as far as is possible without bad
results.
The Jingo fury ran riot in Westport
(M.L.) on Peace Day. A well-known and
much-esteemed French citizen innocently enough
hung out the French flag by way cf cele-
bration. This was too much for the patriotio
pro-Gores, who hauled down the flag and
trailed it in the mud. Another crowd paraded
the'town with an effigy of ex-President Kruger,
and demanded free drinks at the hotels. One
publican refused to accede to the steal, whereupon
the drunken Jingoes proceeded to hang the effigy
to the lamp in front of the door. One of his sons
attempted to prevent this, and a violent scuffle'
ensued, ending in the young fellow’s leg being
broken. These proceedings have excited disgust
even on the Jingo-ridden West Coast, and a,
public apology has, through the influence of cer-.
tain citizens, been made to the Frenchman. The.
leg-breaking episode will probably reach, the law;-,
courts.
The great dailies would have us believe,
that Canada is enthusiastically Jingo, but the real
position is carefully suppressed. As a matter of
fact, there is a strong Separatist party in Canada.
Its real stronghold is in the French provinces; but
its adherents are to be found all thrpugh the
Dominion. Premier Laurier is a French Canadian,
and, though his staunchest supporters are opposed
to cohentingenting, he has played to the Imperial
gallery in order to conciliate the “loyal” pro-
vinces. Had the Premier been anything but a
French Canadian there might have been violent
anti-jingo manifestations in the French provinces
ere now. Also, there is a strong feeling in
Columbia on account of Chamberlain’s disallowing
the Aliens Restriction Act. Yellow labor is
cutting out white in the mines there, and the race
question is becoming so acute that J. Brum, will
have to forego his fondness for the Jap. if he
wishes to avoid consequences so hideous to con-
template that it would be treasonable to mention
them just now.
TIME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Time called for a man,
There came John See ;
See and O’Sullivan,
And Mister Lee.
Time, sick with debt and drought,
Brooked no delay ;
They played at in or out,
And drew their pay.
The Time said : “ Hearts and men,
Peak, pine, and die.”
They: “ We’ll discuss that when
We’ve got Supply.”
The Time said : “ Rain will come—
Make ready now.”
They : ‘ ‘ But we cannot slum
The King’s pow-wow.
“ We needs must make that bright,
Though things be dull.”
The Time’s reply was quite
Unquotable.
But the deep, indrawn breath
Seemed to partake
Of prescience of death
And ruinquake.
And when the next call’s heard
And understood, i
The people’s answering word |
May show a mood
Disastrous to the clan
Of Premier See,
See and O’Sullivan,
And Mister Lee.

Debility
COMPLETELY CUBED BY
VITADATIO
A resident of Magill, S.A., has added his testimony to
the many others in praise of this wonderful remedy.
He says:—“ A member of my family was suffering from
nervous debility, and became so weak and ill that the
carrying out of daily duties become a burden, and at
length impossible. Medicine did not appear to do any
good, and a change of air was suggested, but as this was
impossible under existing circumstances, I looked for
something else to afford relief. In looking over a paper
one evening the words “ TEY VITADATIO,” caught my
eye. I did so, and after the sufferer had taken the first
bottle an improvement was noticeable, and three other
bottles effected a complete cure. This was two years
ago, and there has been no return of the illness since.
I have recommended VITADATIO to several similary
afflicted, and the same good results have followed.”

NEWMAN, CHEMIST, 82 King-street, Sydney.
The American Declaration of Independence,
printed in English and Spanish in parallel
columns, was being distributed among the Fili-
pinos when the U.S. military authorities inter-
fered and suppressed it. One officer declared it to
be “ a d incendiary document ” as, from a
Jingo standpoint, it undoubtedly is.
Hear the bitter cry of Melb. Argus :
The defect of the Commonwealth honor list is that, apart
from military officers who fought for the flag in S’Africa, it
is made up mainly of politicians. . . . We look in vain for
adequate recognition of men distinguished in scholarship,
etc. . . . Some day, and soon, let us hope, the Imperial
recognition of merit will be broadened here as it has been
broadened in the United Kingdom.
And, let us hope, dear friends, that it will be
broadened in time to include at least one member
of the present Akgus proprietary.

DEAFNESS.
In addition to the inconvenience inherent in the
infirmity itself, DEAFNESS has a marked influence on
the Mental Development of the individual, when the
latter has been attacked bv it in youth.
For a long time DEAFNESS and CHRONIC AFFEC-
TIONS OF THE EAR have been considered almost
incurable, but recently a very simple means has been
found in the ELECTRICON to successfully apply
METALLIC GALVANIC ELECTRICITY direct to the
Ears, PERMANENTLY CURING DEAFNESS, and com-
pletely banishing all distressing head noises.

HIS RUPTURE
CURED.
Engineer on the Midland Railway
Restored by the Wonderful Rice
Method,
One of the well-known engineers on the Midland
Railway, haying been in their employ a long time,
relates some very interesting facts about how he
,hi lns . e lf of a bad rupture by the Rice
Method. His name is George Jordan, and is in
good standing, so what he says for the benefit of
other railway men who are ruptured can be relied
upon as truthful and of value.
27, Bishopstone Road, Gloucester,
July 21,1901.
Dr. W. S. Rice.
Dear Sir,—l am very pleased to say that I am
cured of Rupture after using jour treatment for
three months, having been ruptured for seventeen
years.
I have already spent a lot of money on treatment,
having paid one doctor sixteen guineas wi bout
getting much good, and L had lost an hope of being
cured until I read your advertisement in Lloyd's
Newspaper.
I acted strictly on your advice, and I have not been
troubled with my Rupture since the first week 1 tried
your treatment, and although I get a lot of shaking
about (being a locomotive engine driver on the
Midland Railway), I have not worn a T ru ;s for a be u
two months, and I do not feel the slightest weaki: as-
now, and am enjoying better health than I have
had for seventeen years.
You can make what use you like of this letter, a j
I am anxious for all sufferers to know of vour treat
meat; and I shall advise all my friends afflicted with
this complaint to use it, as I know it will cure per-
manently.—Your faithfully, George Jordan.
'i he RICE Method of curing rupture is as near
perfect as anything could be, and a great many
remarkable cures have been effected. Every
runtm °d railway man should write Dr. YV. S. Rice

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Isn’t it about time that Australian newspapers
decided to preserve a solemn silence re the brutality of
Spanish bull-fights, which are mainly a slaughter of
broken-down horses ? In one hurdle race at Flemington
last Thursday four horses came to fatal smash —died at
once, or were mercifully shot soon afterwards. In the
steeplechase a horse fell at the first fence and broke its
neck Five other animals fell without happening to hurt
themselves, and the jockeys had singularly good luck.
One of them got slight concussion of the brain, but that
is a mere detail. No funerals resulted.
Hd all five of these horse fatalities occurred
through the sinful “ stiffness ” of the jumps in the steeple-
oourse, the demand for a removal of at least one danger-
ous obstacle might have moved the V.R.C. stewards to do
as they would be done by , if they themselves were com-
pelled, by the club’s rules, to ride over the big sticks
every’now and then.. Flemington.steeple-course is an
awfully cruel ordeal for even first-class jumpers
accustomed to easier conditions. As time goes on it be-
comes comparatively more and more dangerous, because
’chasers are more frequently raced elsewhere, over lower
fences, than in days of old. They travel faster and fall,
oftener—at Flemington. To every appeal for a reduction
In the death risk at headquarters the conservative
stewards answer “No.” They glory in Flemington’s repu-
tation for being a caution to jumpers. They dangle
the scalps of slaughtered gee-gees from their official
girdle, so to speak, and contemplate the stone walls and
Formidable timbers with the proud smile of heroes who
don't have to take part in a Grand National. A while ago
It was hoped that the stone wall near the abattoirs
(generally called “the Cathedral,” because no jockey
nears it without thinking of his soul and his hereafter)
would be removed from the track. “The cathedral”
doesn’t even give the occupants of stand and hill any
horrors for their money. They can’t see it, and don’tknow,
most of them, that it is the most fatal obstacle on the
track. In the unholy name of Sport The Bulletin herewith
lays its curse upon the Cathedral and other excessive
dangers of the V.R.O. jumping country. There has been
far too much bloodshed at Flemington these last few years.
Phantom riders of phantom steeds haunt the course at
night,’tis said, and shake skeleton fists in the direction
of the stewards’ stand. But the comfortably-plump
gentlemen who run the gory show have never held a mid-
night meeting with the ghosts. They take no risks of
any sort. Theirs not to do and die ; theirs but to drop
awgh, blow their noses and wonder why somebody blun-
dered.

Of the five nags killed in “lopping” at Flem-
ington, Thursday last week, Watchdog was best known ;
he won a Newmarket for his then owner, the late Mr. W.
Forrester, and at his best could get over 6 fur. in won-
derfully good time. Subsequent to being purchased at
the dispersal of Warwick Farm stud, Watchdog was
schooled over the sticks, but never took kindly to that
game. He first saw light at Warwick Farm, and was by
Gibraltar from Rose Flaneur, by Segenhoe from Tuberose,
by Grand Flaneur.

V.R.C. Gr.N. Hurdles twenty-second meeting
eventuates this Saturday. That real dyed-in-the-wool
champions are scarce among entrants is proven by small
margin (401b5.) difference between heaviest and lightest
loads. M.L. Battleaxe has top position with 11.12 —141bs.
less than Record Reign, hailing from same province,
humped prominently last season . Only question about
Battleaxe is, can he jump well ? Though there’s no public
showing to go on he must have done something to please
his party. In the matter of speed and bottom
Battleaxe is well up to w.f.a. form, as proved in last
year’s Auckland Century Stakes (11m.), which fell to him
with 8.12, while admitted top-notcher Seahorse finished
out of a place. Battleaxe is rising 8-years-old, and has
started 27 times this season, winning on five occasions.
His haul for the past year totals £1390. The nag’s trainer,
Percy Johnston, through wide experience at cross-
country work, should know what he’s about.

Punters on the first two days of V.R.C.
National meet can spare themselves a lot of groping for
“ dead-birds ’’ by at once making up their minds to
follow the Miller and Manifold colors in every event and
every instance. They may have very bad luck. Probably
it will be not too bad. Possibly it will be very good.
Anyway, the fool who confines his hopes to the pair of
M.s, and indulges in a sneaking fancy for Shoddy, is
pretty certain to do as well for himself as the average
clever person with no settled policy in his mind, and all
sorts of information up his sleeve.

At time of writing, it would seem that the
Holkar-Sindhia G.N. double-backers are badly scorched.
As short as 3 to 1 was accepted about the former’s pro-
spects straight out, and, wherever available, 100 to 2 on
the combination resulted in immediate business. Holkar
is now reported lame, and Sindhia shapes anything but
promisingly. Holkar comes from a family of jumpers,
and is full brother to those cracks, Mysore and Doondiah ;
but, all the same, appearances and portents are ominous.
Victor (list.), in same stable, may come now. He, like
Holkar, is a gelding by defunct Wellington, and is in
clinking condition. good performer, little
talked of, but worth watching, is Isis, winner of about ten
races this season (inclusive of doubles). At Border Town
(S.A.), after securing the Hurdles in each instance, she
won a flat race also. Saturday last, with 11.5, she
annexed Adelaide Hurdles from 10 others, and will only
carry 9.6 in the G.N. event.

M.L. champion ’chaser, The Guard, among ac-
ceptors for the G.N. Steeple, to-day (Sat.), and appor-
tioned 12.7, is a fore-fronter of the first line. M.L. scribes
vote him possessor of every right to be considered among
the best leppers that ever raced in that State. Though
not a weight-carrier in looks, he humps crushing burdens
in startling fashion. During his career, M.L. Grand
National, Napier Park, Wanganui, and Great Northern
'chases have been won by him. The Guard is a gelding
by Vanguard Yattaway, by Nordenfeldt-Yattacy, by Yat-
tendon-Ecstasy. Money scooped by this prad last year
was £B5O, and this year £lOBO. The Guard is in the stable
of J. H. Prosser, who last year brought Advance and
Boreas to Australia. M.L. nags have not once succeeded
in either of the big jumping struggles at Flemington.
Donald (twice), Ixion, and Keppo filled places in the
hurdles, while Peter Osbeck, Dart, and Titokowaru have
steeplechase seconds credited in their records.

Postmaster-General Drake is alleged to have
terrible designs on Ikey Mo. and co., and, with this end
in view, has instructed the Postal authorities to get par-
ticulars of such Mo.’s as use the Postal Dept, for business
purposes. So far, after long and exhausting inquiry, the
authorities have discovered the staggering number of
two in S.A. and six in N.S.W. ! Now, suppose P.M.
Drake were to put an office-boy on to copy the names of
the hundreds of gentle Mo.’s who invite business through
the post in the press of the Commonwealth ?

A simple-minded litigant, suing for the return

Return match Australia v. Yorkshire opened in
fine weather, but on a soft wicket, Monday last week.
Twenty-six bats were out first day. Initial innings of
Australians produced 106 ; Darling (40) and Hill (34) doing
best. Yorkshire’s first essay brought 77. For England
Rhodes got 5 for 49, Haigh 4 for 18, and Hirst 1 for 34.
For us Trumble (6 for 17) and Saunders (4 for 58) did all
the bowling work. Second innings results were—Aus-
tralia 87, towards which Gregory compiled 42, and Hop-
kins (next best) 10. Haigh bagged 5 for 49, Rhodes 4 for
22, and Hirst 1 for 12. Yorkshire accumulated 72.
Trumble scattered stumps six times for 27, Saunders
twice for 26, and Howell once for 15. Australia thus
finished 44 best. This Australian success tops everything
previously done this tour. Wicket conditions were
apparently about the same for both sides, though Aus-
tralia had, perhaps, something to the good in getting to
work first and forcing things before the pitch became
worse, to which is attributable the comparatively big
totals and lengthy partnership of Darling and Hill, that
practically pulled the visitors through. None have
shaped with anything like the same effect as Trumble,
and his 6 for 17 is the best accomplished by him so far.
Noble seems to have dropped form with the bat com-
pletely ; his record to the close of the Yorkshire match
was only 142 in 15 finished innings—three times n.o.—
thus giving an average of 11 ‘B3. Rhodes got Noble
twice—once for a blob and next for a single. In the sub-
sequent match against an English eleven at Bradford M.

“An English Eleven" met the Australians at
Bradford recently, and turned out to be the weakest
combination that has yet come forward to be butchered.
All the big counties needed their full strength elsewhere,
and the Australians piled up 402 first attempt ; Duff
making 182, Trumper 113, and Armstrong 38. England
hit up 240 first innings and 203 second. Australia’s
second innings saw 3 wickets down for 42, of which Hop-
kins made 11, and the not-out men, Armstrong and Duff,
14 and 11 respectively. In English first innings Noble
took 3 for 34, and Saunders 3 for 13. Second innings
Saunders 4 for 66, and Noble 3 for 67. Australia won by
seven wickets. The match was a solemn sermon on the
uncertainty of cricket. Four Austral wickets were down
for 35, and then the score jumped to 226. Just here
Trumper scored his thousand runs in 16 matches, and
beat Darling’s record for a whole tour. Trumper’s
aggregate is 1024, and with 21 matches yet to slog through
he has a fair chance of shifting the record above the 2000
mark. Darling reached the 24th match before making up
his little lot in ’99 ; Trumper has made his in an excep-
tionally short time in the wettest English cricket season
for 40 years. This was the first match played right
through without rain.
Things sporting seem coming to a head in
connection with Sydney Cricket Ground. The N.S.W.
Cricket Association, the Football Union and the Bicycle
organizations all complain against the Ground Trustees
for the grasping all-round charge of 20 per cent, on the
gross receipts for all events on their ground. This comes
hard on the sporting associations, for in the event of
failure through wet weather or other cause the Associa-
tion Ground collars its 20 per cent, just the same. The
cyclists and cricketers are quite at the mercy of the
Trustees, but the footballers have effectually kicked. The
Agricultural Society combined with the Cricket Ground
to force the Union to pay 20 per cent, as usual for the
coming interstate football matches with Queensland, but
the University people, whopossess afine oval, unexpectedly
cut under the combine. The Football Union has closed
with this offer, and all the matches other than some club
engagements will be played at the University. Which is
rough on the Sydney Cricket Ground subscribers, who for
their yearly £2 2s. are promised, among other attractions,
the pick of the football matches. Supposing other sports
follow suit, the members of the Cricket Ground, whose
one privilege is sitting in the pavilion, will have to fall
back on ping-pong to get value for their money.

Inter-State football, Vic. v. S. A.., “ Australian ”
game, had a 10,000 gate in Adelaide. Jack Worrall went
over as manager of the Melb. 18, who were very strong
and were expected to win easily. They shone at hand-
ball, their punching being marvellous, and were, perhaps,
altogether more scientific; but for brilliant individual
work the home team scored nearly all the time. Lament-
ably bad kicking by S.A. kept their goal tally well behind
till nearly half-time, when they equalised. Again at
three-quarter time they were 11 points behind, but stay-
ing power brought them home by 11 goals 15 behinds to
9.8. It is only S.A.’s fourth win, as against 14 to Vic.

“ H.P.” : Re A.M.B. (28/6/’O2) on the kicking
of Sydney footballers. Why doesn’t he have a look at all
the clubs? What about Western Suburbs, with Stan.
Wickham and Johnson —undoubtedly the two finest
place-kickers in N.S.W. ? On June 21st at Uni. Oval,
Wickham kicked five goals from marks —two at a
distance between 70 and 80 yards, the others at between
40 and 50 yards. Johnson, a week before, at North
Sydney, kicked two marvellous goals from near half-way
—one almost on the touch-line. Western Suburbs have
won nearly all their matches by kicking, and are now
level with Glebe at the top of the competition. Further,
nowadays, there is much “ kicking for the touch-line,”
which is becoming an art in football.
* • • *
Out of 23 points to nil scored by Western
Suburbs against South Sydney, Saturday week, Wickham
(captain) kicked 5 goals from marks, totting up 20 points
on his own. The kicks were from all distances. There
are possibilities about being Wickham's dog.
“Old Timer”: Recently dead English sport,
Capt. Machell, once jumped from the floor to a mantel-
piece. In Sydney, years ago, a prominent bowler, in
evening dress, and without divesting himself of a single
garment, jumped backwards from the floor to the bar-
counter of the old Lighthouse Hotel, Druitt-st., to satisfy
a wager made on the spot a few minutes before. Height
was every inch of 3ft. 6in. This rather overshadows Capt.
Machell’s feat.

Sheep-dog trials at Sydney Agricultural So-
ciety’s Grounds, last week, were not up to last year’s.
Time originally allowed to drive three sheep round two
flag-posts, through a hurdle, round a third post, twice
through a maltese cross in a fixed direction, and then into
a pen, was smins. less than last year’s limit (15mins.), but
the old order was reverted to on the final day, and still
not a dog did it completely—penning blocked them all.
Last year one tyke finished the whole business in TJmins,
Messrs. King and M’Leod’s Biddy came out best with 185
points. She operated in remarkably cunning fashion,
and got through everything but the pen-puzzle, though
one of the trio walked in but came out again. Messrs.
Maiden Bros.’ Darkie (182 points) was runner-up, and
worked more demonstratively than the rest, exhibiting
heaps of skill and patience. The next best score was
Messrs. Maiden Bros.’ Needle’s 175. Subsequently Biddy
and Needle contested a private match for £25 aside, and
Biddy gathered up the money with 277£ points to t’other’s
257 J. Biddy brought her charges to the outside of the
pen in the time which found Needle still battling at the
cross.

Table-tennia craze still rages in Sydney, where
competitions are progressing and talked of to the complete
shutting out of ordinary tennis, croquet, puff-billiards,
and kindred nerve-racking pastimes. Ladies’ amateur
supremacy of the State finished at the Y.M.O.A. Hall,
Monday night, before a full house, mostly women. Two
couples of sisters—the Misses Dransfield and Maitland —
were the surviving four of a large entry. Big crowds
watched the play afternoon and evening, and but for the
interspersing of heats of the “Gentlemen’s First-class
Handicap,” would have been crushed with the monotony
of the thing, as most of the ladies sacrificed all to
“ safety ” ; the few who did show brilliant work went out
early—they took risks. Misses Nellie Dransfield and
M. Maitland met in the final, and, after a dragging,
wearying match that once looked like lasting all night, the
first-named won, 12-5. Champion male player, Horace
Elliott, easily annexed first pot in the competition
restricted to men, as not one of the others—though many
were capital exponents—could pace it with him. Said
that Elliott practises night and day, and this scribe is
quite ready to believe it. As The Bulletin goes to press,
a big tourney, promoted as a spec., wherein something
like 150 table-tennis cranks will compete for £l5O worth
of prizes, is starting at the Queen’s Hall, Sydney.

Apropos pigeon-slaughterers Eales v. “Locks-
ley.” Strangely enough winner (Eales) has never suc-
ceeded in annexing N.S.W. supremacy, but on three
different occasions has defeated owners of that title in the
persons of Massey, “ Bobby ” Grant and “ Locksley.”
Conditions for these matches provided for 100 birds each,
and the consistency with which Eales performed is evi-
denced by the fact that he brought down 288 of the 300
shot at by him. Anyhow, a man who shoots pigeons
with a gun at catapult range and calls himself “ Locks-
ley ” deserves to be beaten. What the others deserve this
writer cannot declare in polite language.

Inter-State bruising match, ’tween Melbourne
“ Billy ” Palmer and Sydney “ Charlie ” Frost at Golden
Gate A.O. (Sydney) Saturday night, was a warm, willing
scrap. Palmer rose inches higher and stretched inches
further than Frost, and was apparently a stone heavier.
Both fought all they knew right through. Frost thumped
hard lefts home, followed instanter by skull-shaking
rights on the jaw and point frequently. Palmer also
drove the left in stiffly and landed effectively with right
swings and crosses that brought the Sydney man down.
They slogged away, at times toe to toe, without flinchng
and as fast as one could punch the other, and came in
again to take and give some more. The air was thick
with bull-like roars and fierce offers of 6 to 4, 5 to 4, or
evens Frost—as the changing situations prompted. It
was the real stingo till, in the fifth round, one on
the point floored Frost, who went to his knees and then
sat down on his haunches, bent upon taking as much of
the lOsec. allowance as possible, but he left it too long,
and didn't begin to rise till after “ nine,” and was outed.
’Twas finely-cut counting indeed, but none the less fair,
and should always be so, though it rarely is. Referee,
are loth to end a fight too early, anxious that spectators
may get the worth of their coin, thus ignoring the faot
that the principals are fighting a match (and not an
exhibition bout) for money and reputation.

Quite a swagger committee has been got together
to supervise the coming championship glove contest
between Felix and Doherty, in Melbourne. Guy Madden,
following in the footsteps of his waxed papa, takes a hand
in it, and several other mighty gentlemen sit with him.
This committee can declare the match “ snide,” and
scatter the prize amongst the hospitals if not satisfied
that the lanky black and his more lumpy opponent have
done their darnedest. Basto referees, and his judgments
are respected by such clean people as like boxing.

Swimmer George Read easily won his first
race “ down-under,” a half-mile event at Surbiton,
in 9.12 J Some Sydney papers got sadly tangled over
the time. One evening sheet wisely opined that the
distance must have been 500 yards, as the time, com-
pared with previous performances, was impossible for
880 ; another felt perfectly satisfied that the message had
been mutilated in transmission, or something to that
effect. Truth is, however, that Surbiton is on the
Thames, and at a spot where the current runs strong
mostly, and extra strong at times, hence the swimmers
would be carried along at a great bat.

Gabled from London, Monday, that at the
English Life Saving Society’s big carnival previous Satur-
day, witnessed by 30,000 people, Australians Read and
Cavill started in the mile championship for the Prince of
Wales’ Cup. Britisher Jarvis finished first, with his
fellow-countryman, Billington, second, Read third, and
Oavill fifth. Time (25min. 35sec.) though fast, is much
slower than that accomplished here by both Oavill and
Read last year, which fact indicates that they are not
themselves yet; Oavill could only have reached London
a few days before the race, and then weightily handi-
capped by lack of funds and opportunities to prepare.
Probably subsequent contests will see both shaping
nearer their Australian form. By cable also comes
information that at the same gathering Australian
Fred Lane won the big 150yds. handicap from scratch,
and possibly beat England’s and the world’s amateur
sprint premier, Derbyshire.

Never has such interest been taken in a road-
race in Australasia as in the coming Dunlop race from
YVarrnambool to Melbourne. Entries are already coming
in fast from country districts ; the fact that the first arid
second prizes, together with four others, were won by
country riders last year, evidently gives encouragement
to country cyclists to compete against the metropolitan
cracks.

Popular notion that last year’s record (£153,399)
for tote biz. at Auckland R.C.’s Ellerslie meetings would
stand long has been knocked endways this season, as the
13 days’ racing saw £174,734 put through. An increase of
£21,335 on previous best, is staggering. Inference, of
course, is that A.R.O. prize-money will swell considerably
henceforth.
THE BOXERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A hundred quid is in the hall, and both are fit and strong,
And take the centre smartly when M‘Ewan thumps the
gong.
Like jealous cats we creep and spar, like cat’s his small
eyes burn.
We’ve a bad old score to settle, and a hundred jim to earn.
The crowd drops still and silent, but for me there’s not on
earth
Any living thing but Gander, and I fight for all I’m worth.
In thick, short neck, and arm, and flank each muscle is
awake,
And his wicked left is darting with the venom of a snake.
So, warily, until he feints, and, leading, lifts his guard,
Then, biffl my counter clips him on the cheek-bone,
straight and hard.
We mix it for a moment, and the lads behind him cry,
“ First blood 1 ” It is to Gander for a jab above the eye.
In corners while they fan and spray my flesh is gll elate
With fierce, hot lust of fighting that is passion but not
hate.
It’s vile and low and brutal to the ewe-necked man, I
know,
But before the crawler’s cunning I prefer a honest blow.
The gong ! And once again, with thew and nerve and eye
alert,
We slip about the ring, and hit, and clinch, and break
unhurt.
We fight now not for money or the glory of the hour,
But for the pride of race, and for the clean man’s; love of
power.
The go is willing, first and last. The backers yell delight
When I smartly lead or counter, or he swings his vicious
right;
And yet I feel him waiting, like a panther lying low,
And watch his tricks to out me with his famous body
blow.
Ten rounds are fought—ten clinking rounds. I’ve seen
him neatly spread
While eight was called. His people looked like mourners
o’er the dead.
But Gander rallied gamely, and was succoured by the
gong ;
The stab with which we parted left me rather in the
wrong.
It’s good to be in corners now, with towels briskly going,
And, like a mother’s blessing, feel the tender waters
flowing.
The gong! We spar. It seems to me the room is getting
dark.
He leads. The crowd gives one sharp yell. My left has
found the mark 1
But Gander grows before my eyes, he tops me like a wall.
As on a stack of bricks I feel my feeble counters fall.
His white set teeth are all I see. I want to turn and run,
And deep within my heart I know that Gander’s got me
done.
A stunning left, a heavy thud, then silence all around,
Till faintly, from a distance, comes a slow, familiar sound.
A voice is counting : “ Seven l . . . Nine ! ” Then breaks
a smothered shout.
As in a dream I hear it—Gander’s cobbers yelling :
“ Out 1”
I'm licked! I’m lickedl And stupidly I wonder what
is there —
A man upon his back. The chaps are pumping him for
air.
My legs are planted under me. I peer again, in doubt.
Good Lord 1 I’m up and waiting. It is Gander who is

Dyspepsia and Liver Disease.
Cubed by Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills.
Of the hundreds of letters received from people
who have derived a benefit from taking Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills, there are few that we
take more pleasure in publishing than the one
from Mr. J. H. King, 11 Jersey Terrace, Sydney.
His words have the ring of truth, and will carry
weight. They are as follow:—“It is with the
utmost pleasure I testify to the efficacy of Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills in a case of chronic
dyspepsia. Por many years I suffered from this
dire complaint, with its attendant evils ; have con-
sulted doctors, and tried inumerable remedies
with no beneficial result. At last, on the recom-
mendation of a friend, I purchased a bottle of
your pills (putting little faith in them), but was
surprised after a few days to find my digestion
decidedly improved, and now I am pleased to
inform you, after a course of your pills, I am
perfectly free from all symptoms, have a good
appetite, and can digest any kind of food.” Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills are a perfect blood
purifier, and a positive cure for biliousness,
indigestion, constipation, headaches, sallow com-
plexion, liver and kidney troubles, piles, pimples,
boils and blotches, and for female ailments. Put
up in amber bottles, and the full name blown
thereon.*
Some time ago Good Words offered a
prize for a Coronation ode. Responses have come
from 1050 alleged poets, including 182 Australians.
Of the latter M.L. contributes 71, Victoria 59,
N.S.W. 20, S.A. 14, Tas. 11, Q. 25, and W.A. 2.
In the U.S. only one was sufficiently inspired by
the big prize to ode the event; while Canada was
stirred to the tune of 91.
“ Koorawatha” to The Bulletin
You err in stating (8., 21/6/’O2) that Generals de la
Bey and Olivier escaped from Cronie’s laager a few days
before the surrender. As a fact, De la Rey was at Coles-
berg, and Olivier at Stormberg, when Cronje’s laager was
being surrounded, and it was Christian de Wet’s plucky
attacks which sought to relieve the pressure. After
Magersfontein, De la Rey was ordered to Golesberg,
where Gen. French had gradually pushed the Boer forces,
under Piet de Wet (Christian’s brother), back to the Free
State border. Soon after De la Rey’s arrival several
sharp engagements took place, all more or less in favor of
the Boers, the result being that the British forces were
gradually forced back to Ochertang. Gen. French had
meanwhile been ordered to help in the relief of Kimber-
ley, and De la Rey was still in command when the Wilt-
shires were so badly cut up in their game effort to put a
good face on a general retreat. It was not until Oronje
had been surrounded for several days that De la Rey was
ordered north to attempt—in conjunction with Christian
de Wet—the relief of Cronje.

James Brunton Stephens.
THE LAST OF THREE.
T ~ ~ , , e
James Brunton Stephens, the last of the three
whose names will be naturally bracketed m the
literary history of Australia, died on Sunday
morning, June 29th, 1902. It is twenty years since
Kendall was taken away from St. Vincent’s Hos-
. , ~ , .
pital to die m his friend s house. Gordon put
the muzzle of a rifle to his head down by
Brighton beach. Stephens had a longer, perhaps
a happier, life than the others, but—oh, the pity
of it! that his life, like the others, was mainly
wasted. He was created to write, to interpret, to
, . , v it r .1 • _ . ii’ nanar*
explain the parable of things to the present gener-
atom, to add to the artistic: inheritance of man-
kind. It was m him to have done as mucn tor
Australia as Bret Harte or Mark Twain did for
jhe „ M. of America—neither of these

these and there is a curious irony ■mlthe.fact that
the placing him thus was regarded of
special grace and favor. There is nothing new m
it. Burns was made a guager bee-use he: had the
SSS
white angel side, the only poet of his time
Stephens was a Scotchman, born at Linlithgow.
He worked his way through school and college in
the old heroic Scotch style, and in 1866 made the
long sailing voyage to Australia. Nothing m the
old world seems to have impressed him. 1 here is
not a touch of “Caledonia stern and wild
throughout his verse. It was a maiden muse he
took to his tutorship in the bush, and the first
rhymes strung were Australian as the kooka-
hurra’s chatter.
The humor and the tragedy of hum m life im-
pressed him more than inanimate matters; indeed,
it may be said without detracts h that he never
caught the actual characteristics of the Australian
beauty or the Australian gloom. He was differ-
entiated from Kendall in that way. Humanity
magnetised him everywhere, and he saw the
greatest of Australian matters in the light of pos-
sible human effort. “The Dominion” is the
best of all his verse in this way, and the
comparison therein of the tide of Federal feeling
and the “unseen river” of the continent stands
out colossal amongst all efforts of Australian
imagination. Black gins and Chinese cooks are
graphic and true as B. E. Minns’ sketches ; and
those old “Boanah” and “Marsupial Bill”
ballads, which made several Xmas Queens-
LAN dees remarkable, are of things which will
remain.
But the one poem on which his literary fame
must rest is “Convict Once”; given the oppor-
tunity, encouragement, sympathy such natures
require, the author of that poem could have raised
a temple of art comparable to anything accom-
plished in his generation. The subject was un-
happily dragged out of the strictest taboo
of Australia, and its unrelieved sadness re-
cC;taPto W X m sSe„t^he do hi«h e " otth“i-
-of art, the bold imagery, the exquisite workman-
ship, even as the harrowing pathos and the unre-
lenting agony of that great poem, appeals irre-
sistibly. It is no more to be read for pleasure than
is the “ Antigone or the Cenci. Fate works
to an end in the old classic way, and the eutha-
nasia of the Queensland governess is inevitable
and terrible as the self-slaughter of the daughter
of (Edipus. Brunton Stephen put all his soul and
all his strength into that work ; each stanza he
carved in ivory or in ebony, and the whole stands,
and will stand, a model of what maybe done in
the handling of human subjects ainongst Aus-
tralian circumstances.
It is said frequently as foolishly that he ex-
hausted himself in that work. The truth is, he
gave us other kingly evidence of what was in him,
and we gave him in return—those things which
have been already mentioned. They, or at least
the more considerable of them, would never have
come but for the sympathetic recognition and aid
given by Gresley Lukin, as sole head of the
Courier and Queenslander papers. Lukin gave
Stephens what help these papers could give,
found him a field where he might at least assert
himself locally, and forced recognition in a prac-
tioal way from the Ministry of the time. Through
press influence Stephens was taken from the
school-desk and made corresponding clerk to
Tbomas M’llwraith (not exactly Milton and
Cromwell over again !). Later he became Under-
Secretary, and found as much inspiration and
opportunity to write verse, as Mr. Critchett
Walker feels inclination.
Ihus the man was lost, and the full measure he
brought into the world spilled. How he suffered
in th B at i osing and spilling is amongst things that
w in never be told. Those who knew him most
intimately know that his life was one of stern and
continuous self-repression. He had a Devil, as
ve m ° st of that company, but he kept him down
through years which came very close to three
score and ten . He fulfilled all fche uaua]ly
recognised obligations of life, and died in his bed
an esteemed and worthy citizen. But what of the
might-have-been ? What if those great and
wealt} W newspaper proprietaries, whose best-
P a -™S <? la Vf , have been the brains of literary
workers had in this case as m others done what m
of Heaven and earth it came to them tQ
do ? what the o ld QUEENSLANDER began to
, . ~ , , c nlu -t*. .i
do ln fche before lt ,’ as all fcbe others > lefc the
, Stranply.eUgh, theS.lt
. for , that might-have-been in a kindly-enough
leader on the poet The constant anxieties
depending upon the man who has to earn his
§ bread as well as immortality must have
interfefed to a large extent with Mr. Stephens*
fertility as a poet. The main business of a man
abu ' dant if gifted as Mr . Stephens was to con-
tibto go fa / a | he could to the world’s literature
the literature which the world cannofc spare .
Unfortunatel for us> Mr . Stephens had to con-
"imscl, and Ms P«i t io„ before indulging hi,
But why did nofc « us ,» that particular “ us,” so
arran g e out of its abundance in another sort that
daily bread should have been available with-
ouj. renunciation of the golden apples which
m {ght have been plucked for the cheering and
healing of mankind? He was worth more than
daily bread for even a little prose work on any
g re at daily paper. But there was no place found
f or him, and so he dragged out his dreary life,
g t rvi ck his one full chord and his subsequent
broken music, and died.
Personally, Brunton Stephens was a man whom
few knew, who allowed very few to get inside
the husk of commonplace he chose to wear. He
was utterly unselfish, knew nothing of jealousy,
appreciated everything everybody achieved in his
own art, and understood what they intended.. He
was a good comrade on rare Johnsonian nights,
and a keen fighter when, with much artful sym-
pathy, he was induced to draw in earnest. The
bit of good old Scotch granite in his constitution
kept him from crumbling or yielding, and held
him up to the unremitting, strenuous effort re-
quisite to the earning of the daily bread, and the
renouncing for ever the golden dream. And so he
died, the esteemed head of a great State dep-irt-
ment; but will live in other ways. “Godolphin
Arabian,” “AHundred Pounds,” and “Fayette”
are with things which do not matter much,
“ Mute Discourses ” are not strong or deep with
the fullness of life; but the august Dominion
verse, the classic and tragic “ Convict Once,” and
the “ bits of blackfellow ” will endure while the
wattles bloom, and the myalls shine, and the she-
oaks wail, and old Kosciusko shows his winter
shroud and summer flower crown to the sky.

F. T. Derham, with his Tory crust on
him like a 90-year-old turtle, wobbled out from
amongst his biscuits, t’other day, to be made
president of Vic. Employers’ Federation, and de-
livered once more the oration he has been re-
hashing over and over again for the last 12 years.
Derham’s everlasting speech consists of four main
spasms. (1) That the Employers “abhor sweat-
ing ; ” (2) that conciliation and arbitration, and
“all other socialistic legislation, must be strenu-
ously combated.” No. 3 is all about the imaginary
capitalist who came from Labrador or Greece to
start a large business, but wouldn’t when he saw
the awful way this country went in for new ideas ;
and the fourth and most terrible spasm sets forth
that the “socialistic legislation” aforesaid has
attracted so much of the country population to
cities, that the poor farmers are unable to get men.
It is no longer necessary for the Melb. papers to
send a reporter when Derham speaks—they
just print his four spasms again.

There has not been a more interesting
Australian book published for a long time than
“Bushman and Buccaneef ” —giving the life and

Every bush man will want to buy a copy for the
sake of the complete collection of “The Breaker’s”
verses which it contains. The book gives a photo-
graphic reproduction of the “ copy ” of Momnt’s
last verses, written in gaol, and many illustrations,
from authentic photographs, of the Bushveldt

The Canada Cycle and Motor Co., of 357
ileorge-street, Sydney, have instituted, in connection
with their cycle trade, a most up-to-date and splendidly
stocked sports department. Nothing has ever existed in
Australia on a par with it. The department is controlled
by an expert who has served years in learning every
point of physical culture. For a few pounds—for much
iess money in fact than the average man spends on wine
and cigars in six months—anyone can be fitted up with a
svstem of home exercises which will give exceptional
vigor to the body and extraordinary spring to the mind
and will. In this world, the battle goes to the strong
without exercise. One great boom is a practically noise-
less punching bag. Prior to the arrival of this noiseless
bag, a man could not punch the bag without kicking up
a devil of a row, causing the neighbour and his wife to
rush upon the scene screaming that the twins had taken
a fit through fright. Another boom is a rowing machine
which affords better exercise than rowing itself. Not
only that, there is no fear of falling out of it into cold
water and getting eaten by sharks. A third is the Sandow
spring-grip dumb-bell which makes you strong enough
in the hand to split a bullock’s forehead with one punch.
A fourth is the Sandow exerciser, which not only braces
the system everywhere but also adds greatly to a man’s
personal appearance. A fifth is Sandow’s embrocation
which cures all muscle-pain or stiffness. In short, the
company represents the brain of the world as applied to
physical culture. Write the co. for books and informa-
tion.*

The Photographic Competition inaugurated
by Messrs Harrington and Co., Ltd., who ara
giving £6O in cash prizes, has been an unqualified
success, and an interesting display of some of the
pictures is on view in their window, photographio
warehouse, 66 King-street.
The up-to-date business man appreciates healthy
competition—the keener the better. It acts as a
stimulant, and increased success means new business
enterprise. Such a man is Sydney’s well-known jeweller,
Mr. A. Saunders, whose name has become synonomous
with excellence and cheapness all over Australia, for all
that the jeweller’s art can produce. Sis extensive
business premises, in George-street, Sydney, opposite
Redfern railway-station, contains show-rooms which
absolutely defy faithful description. For wedding-
presents, birthday-gifts, presentations &c., &c., Mr.
Saunders offers a choice as wide and varied in price and
quality as could be desired. And, in addition to his
business as manufacturing jeweller and silversmith, he
has opened a new optical department, and has made
arrangements for testing eye-sight free of charge, and the
manufacturing of lenses to suit all defects of the eye.

There is this
peculiar thing
about our Hair
Vigor: it’s a hair-
food, not a dye.
It doesn’t turn
your hair sud-
denly black and
make it look dead
and lifeless. But
gradually the old
color comes back,
all the rich color it
used to have. And
it also stops falling
of the hair.
Even if your hair
isn’t comieg out,
isn’t turning. gray,
isn’t too short,
yet you certainly
want a fine dress-
ing for it, and here
it is.
Ayer’s Hair Vigor
It keeps the scalp clean and healthy,
removes all dandruff, makes tho hair
grow rapidly, prevents it from falling
out, and does not allow a single gray
hair to appear.
Do not he deceived by cheap imita-
tions which will only disappoint you.
Make sure that you get the genuine
Ayer’s Hair Vigor.

The output of that big Melbourne beer factory,
Oarlton brewery, is said to be on a par. with that of
Tooth’s brewery, Sydney—viz., about 2000 hogsheads per
week. Think of it! — 100,000 gallons, or 800,000 pints
every seven days ! Oarlton does two-thirds of the beer
trade of Melbourne, and pays £lOOO weekly in excise
duty. Lieut.-Col. Ballenger, the man who makes the
mixture, draws the salary of a Cabinet Minister.

The cable announces an alleged discovery of
means to utilise atmospheric electricity. The idea has
been already exploited in Sydney, about the same time
as “ atmospheric gas.” The “ inventor” had a room in a
boarding-house, and was acquainted with the atmos-
pheric-gas man, who possibly suggested the idea to him.
Writer sold him the battery, which was the source Of
power, and, in all innocence, fixed it up, and three small
incandescent lamps, in his bedroom. The .battery was
hidden behind a screen in a corner, and the wires con-
cealed neatly, and controlled by a switch. Then the in-
ventor went round and announced that he had discovered
how to obtain electricity from the air, and as there are
plenty of flats in Sydney, to whom the word elec-
tricity is a magic term, he ,Jhad no difficulty in
persuading flies to walk into his parlor. He
first .of all pushed a small gas-pipe through
a hole in the wall of his room, and went out on to the
balcony and poured some liquid ammonia inside. In a
few minutes the pungent fumes of the chemical filled the
room. This, the inventor said, was the electricity
materialising. When it had got strong enough he
switched on the batl&rv current, and the room was
immediately brilliantly illuminated, and the mugs
swallowed all the patter that he poured into them, and
he got an order from one tradesman to light up his shop,
receiving £4O on account. A plumber was called in and
given orders to run pipes all over the building, atmo-
spheric electricity being different from the commercial
article and disdaining wires. The inventor then slipped
his cable and made tracks Of course, the present
discovery may not be of that sort, probably isn’t, for the
inventor seems to take it seriously.

•‘Outlaw”: Saw two women looking into a
second-hand shop in RusseJl-st., Melb., and cackling, with
handkerchiefs to mouths. The fat old dame who kept
the place came out when they had passed on, and after
carefully looking over the articles in the window
ap arently decided that there was nothing humorous
about the goods. Strolled up and saw an ancient
mattress on a still older bedstead, and attached to the
latter a card with the announcement, “ Buggies for
hire.”

Told by a Sydney suburban grocer. Small boy
got credit to 35., and the money hail been owing for two
months, when one day the boy turned up with 3s. 6d. to
make purchase. The grocer impounded 3s. in payment
of debt, and sent the boy hack with the 6d. Soon, a
stylishly-dressed young lady appeared, and indignantly
inquired what ttie grocer meant. “ She had sent for
certain articles by a boy who lived near her house, and
the grocer had stolen 3s. of her money.” The grocer ten-
dered humble apologies, told the story of the back debt,
and did a general crawl. The lady allowed herself gradu-
ally to be placated, received the 3s. in cash and Bs. worth
of goods on credit, and went. Then the grocer’s boy,
whom he had just cuffed into a corner, smilingly ex-
plained that the young lady and the small boy were sister
and brother.

The dispersal of the Ward-Cole estate in Mel-
bourne brought under the hammer the ferry-steamer
Gem, and under notice the unique record of that neat
little vessel. She was built in’6B, in a small yard where
Queen’s Bridge now stand, by Messrs. Sinclair (an engi-
I neer) and Colquhoun (a ship’s-carpenter), and her bottom
was of Tasmanian blue-gum, with kauri topsides. Good
judges aver that, with her lately-inserted triple-expansion
engines, she is as good now as on the day she was
launched. Her first, and, up to two years ago, her only
skipper was Capt. Robert Watson. ' For 34 years this
little product of loeai industry cleared her owner from
£BOO to £lOOO a ye ir, while from Jan. Ist to May 31st this
year her net earnings averaged £244 a month ' She was
knocked down cheap at £3OOO.

“Merool ”: Even amongst insurance - agents
there is sometimes a genius. About 20 years back the
Northern parts of Queensland were toured by an agent
who, at each township, gave a banquet, to which every-
one with money was invited. Then, when the company
were comfortably drunk, the genial entertainer would
start in and generally succeeded in making a good
“ bag.”

Related that a well-known Sydney firm lately
advertised for a grocery-hand—apparently just to see how
many of their own men answered it. Anyhow, three of
them who did answer it were immediately “ sacked.”

“ Ell.” : A N.S.W. farmer lately told me that
he averages nearly 30 letters, etc., a week sent him by
pill-men, machine-agents, wool, grain and produce firms,
etc. He reckoned the total postage on the lot he received
last year ran in‘o over £6. What an enormous sum must
be spent in this manner !
* * * *
“ Serulia ”: A Port Douglas man whips the cat,
per local press, over a small consignment of fruit sent
over on spec, to Sydney, on which consignee duly lost
time, labor and money. He is one of the many who prefer
the congested market far away to exploiting the back
places nearer home. Small consignees mostly lose
through freightage, bad stowage, and agents’ exes.—too
lazy, ignorant, or conceited to cater for local needs—
besides it sounds big to talk of “my agent in Sydney.”
Meanwhile the intelligent Chow hawks stringy, half-
rotten bananas, &c., to local factories and townlets,
realises famine prices, and can’t meet the demand of
the beef-and-flour-sickened inhabitants. Same applies
re wine and brandy exported, while North pays fid. and
Is. for rottenest drinks on earth. Tea is also rotten.
Room for a distributive agency with brains.
An Adelaide money-lender lent a needy Gentile
£5 10s. on a note-of-hand, and, when it became due,
charged 10s. a month for renewing it. In this way he
received £4 10s., and then, in default of payment, sued
for £6 (the original sum, plus one month’s interest).
Commissioner Russell described the transaction as
“ simply extortion,” and gave a verdict for £l, the
balance of the loan after deducting the £4 10s. paid in
interest. Also, he entered a nonsuit so far as the sure-
ties were concerned.
“ Will J. *: There’s a living to be made out of
the old tins that litter our country commons. A man
who lately relieved Warracknabeal (Vic.) of its rusty dis-
figurements, sometimes attains to a tenner a week. He
travels from place to place, makes a gigantic pile of all
the tins he can collect, liberally intersperses brushwood,
burns the pile out, rakes out the plates of solder, and
realises.

“Joss ” : There has been much in The Bulletin
lately about the tricks of the wily Hindu hawker, but
nobody hitherto has suggested a method of preventing
him from forcing his goods on unprotected females in
the country districts. These hawkers obtain their annual
licenses, when possible, at the nearest licensing Court ;
otherwise they come to the city and apply there. Before
a license can issue, the applicant must produce a certifi-
cate of good character. And this guarantee is always
signed by the wholesale people who supply the hawker’s
wares. The police, also, are supposed to make inquiries
about the man’s character ; but, as they never go farther
than the people who have already testified thereto, the
whole thing is a howling farce. Country people who have
been intimidated by the black trash should lay a com-
plaint before the magistrate so that the report could lie
forwarded to the Licensing Court and used agains! the
offender upon his next annual application for lie use
renewal.

The Perfection of the Bargain.
A bargain, in order to be perfect, should be a
purchase which is profitable to the purchaser, and
at the same time, not a loss to the seller; We
may therefore call this present offer of the “ EX-
CYCLOP JEDIA BRITANNICA ” an absolutely
perfect bargain. The Daily Mail can afford to
sell the “ Encyclopaedia Britannica ” at half price
for this almost obvious reason : that the demand for
it at such a bargain pr ce is sure (in fact, has
already proved itself) to be extremely large,
enabling, therefore, the printers, binders, im-
porters of leather, manufacturers of paper, and so
forth, to base their cost on very extensive orders,
which, as every business-man will at once re-
cognise, makes it pos ihle to produce each set of
the volumes at a much smaller price than if only a
few sets in all were to be prepared. From the
buyer’s point of view it must be evident, without
argument, that the bargain is almost, if not quite,
unique. You obtain your books at half-price.
Not only that, yeu obtain then, upon a system of
payment which is suited to anyone posse-sed of
even the most moderate means, and which enables
the buyer to have the use of the books while he is
still sending the monthly instalments of 125., by
which he completes their purchase. .
-♦ —-
The Purchase Price.
But, you will naturally ask, although it is very
easy for me to seiid in ss. as a first payment, and
to pay the remainder of the price on such easy
terms as those named, yet still the price of the
book remains as a whole as high as before, and
can I really afford to pay such a sum for one book,
however desirable, however valuable, and how-
ever useful it may be? The answer to your
question is this—that the Daily Mail is offering
you this great work, not only on a system of pay-
ment most convenient and most simple, but it is
doing far more than that, it is offering you the
work at less than half the regular price asked for
it by the publishers.
+
How to Understand the
Bargain.
We cannot, of course, give here either a full
description of the book or complete details of the
bargain. These, however, can be obtained by
everyone who will accept the invitation we cor-
dially offer. You may put entire confidence in
the illustrated Prospectus and other descriptive
matter which will be sent on application.
The Daily Mail has only one regret in offering
this unique book-bargain in Australia, and it is
this—that they are only able to sell at this price,
and on this system of payment, a limited number
of sets. The demarnd has already been very large,
and is steadily increasing day by day, and
the result of this in the near future must be
the withdrawal of the offer, and the consequent
disappointment of those who hesitate too long,
and who send in their orders too late. Free
delivery as far as Sydney.

THE BOOKCASE.
The case is substantially made and neatly
finished. It is about 21in. square and 3ft. high,
and is mounted on castors, so that the ENCY-
CLOPAEDIA may be brought to the side of a
writing-table when in use, or left in a corner when
space is needed for other purposes. The volumes
are arranged on two opposite faces of the Book-
case in so compact a form that any desired article
may be consulted without trouble or loss of time.
The side of the Bookcase is fitted with an adjust-
able slope, on which a volume in use may be placed
at any desired angle. It is entirely optional
whether the Bookcase be ordered or not. It is,
however, a great protection to the books as well
as a convenience in their daily use, and a hand-
some piece of furniture.

The Sixpenny Habit.
Systematic saving is an excellent habit to
acquire, not only because it is the high road to
fortune, but for other reasons. It is so easy to
spend odd sixpences, and, in spending them, un
consciously to fritter away not only shillings, but
pounds. If we could only tot up at the end of a
year the number of odd sixpences we have spent
at odd moments on odd things, we should be
astonished at the sum total. Not only this, but
we should feel that, if we had not so fre-
quently put our hands into our pockets and
taken out 6d. to spend, if, instead, we had laid
that sixpence away—we should not only have
saved a considerable sum, but we should have been
able to purchase, out of these savings, many luxu-
ries and comforts which we have denied ourselves,
believing we were unable to afford them.
Sixpenny Books.
During the last year or so many publishers
have taken to issuing sixpenny paper-covered
volumes, many of them, as regards their contents
at any rate, of very high quality. We can hardly
call it waste of a sixpence to invest it in a six-
pennyworth of good literature. But the time has
now come when it is possible for a man—by the
systematic saving of sixpence a day—to acquire
for himself not only good literature in the form of
sixpenny books, but the very best of good litera-
ture in the form of one of the finest works, both
in quantity and quality, and handsomely BOUND,
that has ever been published. Supposing—and
the supposition is not very extravagant —that you
have ss. by you, which you want to put to some
use, and naturally to the very best use you can ;
and supposing that you see your way, in addition
to this, to saving sixpence, or rather less than six-
pence, a day, you can now acquire the complete
and unabridged volumes of the “ENCYCLO-
PAEDIA BRITANNICA” by so doing.

A New Feature.
For the purpose of encouraging the more general
use of the ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA
as a means of self-culture, a Twenty-sixth Volume,
entitled a “ Handbook of Systematic Readings, ”
has been prepared. The Handbook Volume is
uniform in style with the other volumes of the
work, and contains over 230 pages of practical
suggestions, greatly enhancing the educational
value of the work. The “ Handbook ” will be
sent FREE to every subscriber.

Hope’s Hill, Southern Cross (W.A.), after long
silence, announces a return of 4040 z. from 1410 tons
including cyaniding—which is quite unpayable. Pro-
-30-head battery, was taken over in
96 by Scottish Westralia from “ Captain ” Oates and Nat
Harper, ex-Mayor of Kanowna, and floated in London for
£160,000. Four Griffin mills were installed, under
Manager Honeyman, hut were never used, as test crush-
lngs in the old battery proved unremunerative. Co. was
then reconstructed, and Arch. Wilson, manager of Fraser’s
mine, superseded Honeyman. He built himself a mansion,
ordered a 40-head mill from Martin, of Gawler, and a
magnificent 250-h.p. Robey engine, and discarded the
unused Griffin mills. Wilson’s reign was short and sweet
after the new battery got to work, and the mine was again
closed down as unpayable. The return now announced
should finally convince John Bull, or rather, Sandy Scot,
that Hope smiles but to deceive.
* * * *
Long Reef, Lennonville (W.A.), whose 20-head
mill was closed down in March for a .six months’ spell
owing to all developed ore being depleted, is to make an
immediate start on 2000. tons from the Galtee More lease.
Developments lately have been good, and as the co. now
owns several mines, shares should be a good spec, for a
long shot.
* * * •
Management of Golden Link (W. A.) publishes
in local press the report of a sensational find of a 12ft. lode
on the Eclipse lease, assaying 2oz. 4dwt. on surface.
Writer made exhaustive inquiries, and is quite satisfied
that alleged richness is mythical. Two parties of
tnbutors have tested this lode thoroughly by battery,
and find it unpayable, averaging only 7dwt. per load of
30cwt. They have given notice to abandon their tribute.
The erection of May’s plant will kill the pretensions of
the Eclipse and its neighbor, the Croesus Proprietary.

It is definitely announced that Bewick, Moreing
and Co. have been appointed consulting engineers to the
Ivanhoe. They now control more than a score of W.A.
mines. Moreing, the moving spirit of the firm, is an old
Cornstalk.” This monopoly of mine-control is viewed
with much disfavor by the old school of mine-managers
who think it highly improper that “ school-boys” should
be put in charge of mines. There are many people who
it better to employ intelligent, educated “ school-
boys ” than the old-fashioned practical pragmatical men
who never had no lamin’," and take pride in the fact.
* * * *
Chaff er’s (W. A. ), owing to the favorable develop-
ments in the adjoining Golden Horseshoe on their nor-
thern boundary, are to start serious exploration bv driving
at the 400, 600 and 1000 ft. levels. Mine is now in charge
F. W. Cape, well and favorably known in Sydney.
This co. a year ago floated the Great Fingall South Blocks
adjoining Fingall Consols, but diamond drilling so far has
located nothing of value. Bore at 991 ft. passed through
reef 45in. wide worth 2dwts., and was continued forJJOOft
more without making any other find.

Hannan’s Brown Hill (W.A..), according to
management, has been making a monthly profit of £lO,OOO
since August last, when the last div. was declared. Share-
holders are anxious to know what has become of the
money, information can be obtained locally.
The old White Feather Reward, Kanowna
(W.A.), which was one of the earliest of the State’s mines
to start a battery, is now being taken vigorously in hand
under the direction of Nat Harper, who has been so suc-
cessful with the adjoining mine, and previously with
Frasers. A new main shaft is being sunk ; present
djpth, 500 ft. Mine’s returns in 1896 averaged over 2oz.
>er ton, but were sweetened by pickings from the rich
leaders on the adjoining Red Hill, where Tom Doyle is
now getting such sensational returns Co. never paid
a div., and none in sight.
* • • •
At the Associated (W. A.), the rich chute at the
500 ft. level, Tetley’s shaft, is still giving some good dabs.
The latest manager credited to this mine is Gleisberg,
who formerly had the dual management of the Lady
Looh, Coolgardie, and Half-mile Reef, Bardoc. Mine
and machinery in a terrible muddle, and the man who
gets things ship-shape will deserve heaps of credit.
* * * *
Good progress is being made on the Atlas, Kal-
pini (W.A.), under the control of A. W. Irvine, a capable
man from Queensland. Mine has been opened up by a main
underlay shaft, now down 300 ft., carrying a large payable
quartz reef all the way. . Some 200 ft. of driving has been
done at 200 ft., with highly satisfactory results. Two
a ijoining blocks have recently been acquired, and a 10-
nead battery has been ordered. Orushings expected to
average an ounce.
Latest published return from Peak Hill (W.A.)
is 30200 z. from 3317 tons, 55 per cent, of the gold coming
from accumulated tailings. Darlington Simpson, sponsor
of mine, who recently visited it, assures shareholders that
better results may be looked for ; but his previous pre-
dictions went far “ agley.”
• * * *
Shareholders of Hannan's Proprietary Develop-
ment Co. are again buoyed up with hopes of what may be
expected in their numerous leases. Oroya East is to get
the B. 11. Extended and also the Iron Duke lodes. The
former is very patchy, and the latter is striking south-
west in the centre of the Oroya property and underlying
west, right away from the Oroya East. The Queen of the
VVest is to get the “ rich” lode being worked in the Iron-
sides North, but “ richness ” is a matter, of degree, and in
this instance is nearly freezing-point. The Croesus ProD.
chute is also being dangled before long-beguiled share-
holders, but it is a stage-property bunch or carfots. Co.
has been pursuing a will-o’ : the-wisp since 1895, and is
still on the same track.

The Meat Co. that is establishing works on the
Victoria River, N.T., talks of spending £30,000, and
having everything complete for a start in nine months.

two close calls already—comes, the lucky man will be

~ ‘‘W.F.” writes:—“Outside of Walhalla and
Matlock (Vic.), the Oassilis mine near Omeo is the biggest
thing in Gippsland mining at present. The co. has an
up-to-date crushing, concentrating, roasting, and chlori-
nating plant, and, better-still, a reef worthy' of it.
Worked from a tunnel, the bottom level shows'the reef, a
dense, black,, refractory mineral, to be as rich as, and the
chute longer and wider than, at the levels above, being
over 200 ft. long and tapering, comet-fashion, from 12ft”
in width at the north end to a thin wedge and, finally, a
blank in the south. The school of mines management is
visible in the main shaft now being sunk, so as to cut the
lode at about 100 ft. The mine appears to be officered to
an unreasonable extent, there being an. official even to
measure the holes bored. Writer reckons that with shaft
sunk further from the lode that scrip (42,000) would be a
reasonable gamble at a third of present value of 235. The
Maud and Homeward Bound, Glen Wills, is the only other
working show of note. Competently managed, the co.
has paid a few Od. divs. from the upper levels, besides
making a small fortune for some of the tributors,
but the bottom level—the fatal bottom level—shows the
reef to be mullocky and poor. The co. is putting
in a still lower level, which will either break the mine or
make it—most likely break it. Scrip, which touched £l,
now barely saleable at 4s. At Sunnyside the water is
running out of the mouth of the United Brothers’shaft.
A really good mine, with three distinct gold-chutes
Plant too weak for the work, and directors not stron
enough to resist temptation to pay divs. with mone^
made from the tributors. A good mine and a poor crowd,
who have also had 110 acres of the best prospectable land
on the field locked up for years."

* * * a
\ non sense j s written and talked in
London about Australian mining tenures, and the cry is
being taken up by a few busybodies in Melbourne. It is
asserted that the leasing system gives no security. The
answer to this is that no instance can be cited where a
leaseholder, who could show that he has held the land for
legitimate mining purposes, has been dispossessed. No
bona-fide application for suspension of labor conditions is
ever refused ; if anything, too much leniency is displayed
in this direction, it is argued that the expenditure of
so much money in plant ought to give the holder of the
land a right to it in perpetuity. Under such a system
the owner of half-a-dozen mining plants could secure a
monopoly of half the continent, just as hundreds of
miles of the richest lands in N.S.W. were stolen, per
medium of dummy frame-houses. Let the Londoner com-
pare the conditions under which he is allowed to carry on
mining operations in England with those of Australia,
and he will see how unreasonable are his complaints
against the latter. It is amusing to find American adven-
turers voicing the same complaints. In Australia an
American is at liberty to take out a-miner’s right and
exercise all the privileges which it confers. In America
an Australian is treated as an alien ; he is not allowed to
“ locate” a claim or to be registered as the holder of an
interest in one until he has resided for a certain length of
time in the country and then forswears his former alle-
giance. Australian “ insecurity of tenure ” is a hideous
wild-cat shriek.

“F.0.H.” : Par. (8., 24/5/’O2) about an Auck-
land directorate recalls the following: At a directors’
meeting at the inception of one of the old Etheridge co’s
(when that boom was on some years back in London) one
of the “ guinea-pigs ” could not understand how there
could be so much water below as to necessitate sending
out pumps, and at the same time none on the surface to
crush with. No amount of explanation could get it into
his thick head, but at last the brilliant idea struck him to
obviate the necessity for sending out the pumps by
“ putting the mill down the mine and utilising the water
there for crushing purposes. At this luminous sugges-
tion the old N.Q, prospector who had sold them the mine
nearly died of laughing, much to the disgust of said g.p.,
who could not see the joke.
“Assez”: A Tas. tin co. spent £35,000 on its
property. When the mine looked like a failure, the co.
had a church built, and advised the employees to pray.
Had it prospected the surface within a radius of five
chains of its ore-dressing plant, it would have discovered
one of the richest tin lodes ever found in Tas. Not by
prayer alone is a mine to be saved.

Hackett, Perth newspaper “boss,” tells an
English interviewer that he has had exceptional facilities
to get first-hand information from the mines but “ finding
it quite impossible to fathom the depth of the market
manipulat ions he has ceased t oinvest any money in Westra-
lian gold shares.” A denser, less-informed man than
Hackett should know that W. A. shares are not yet within
reasonable distance of the investment stage. Take the
best of the mines and apply to it the principles which are
supposed to govern a so-called mining investment and the
result will be that present market value is 50 per cent,
above the mark. The man who could really fathom the
depth of market manipulations would become a multi-
millionaire in record time—a few clicks of the cable
would do it. It is the man who thinks that he has
fathomed the mystery who goes down like a sounding
lead.

Charles M'Kinley, Zeehan, writes :—“ As a
tributor, who for the last few years has been tributing on
Zeehan silver-lead field, I should like to tell the public of
Bome of the difficulties that have to be contended with
by such of us as have low-grade ore to sell. We have on
the field a Smelting 00. and a Metal 00. (both German)
who will take your ore on the most liberal terms (for
themselves), and the tributor will be unusually fortunate
if he obtains for his ore anything approaching its value.
It has often been said that during a former period of in-
tense depression tributing saved this field. That is quite
true, but at that time the Smelting Co. had not started
business here. There were several ore-buyers and some-
thing like fair competition existed. The Smelting 00.
has got contracts with various mining co.’s to take all
their ore ; and the co.’s can only let tributes with a
similar condition attached. The result is that we are at
the mercy of the Smelting 00. There are generally de-
ductions sufficient to absorb over 4-sths of the assay-
value of £5 per ton ore. If the Tas. Govt, would adopt
a policy calculated to foster mining industry, it would
erect a smelting plant and treat the ore at a fair price to
. leave a profit just covering interest on the outlay; it
would also reduce railway freights. As things are the
Germans make a very good thing out of the business,
by practically depriving the miner of what ought to be his
legitimate profits.”
[There’s nothing novel in Mr. M’Kinley’s growl. It is
heard all the world over. Every ore-seller thinks that every
ore-buyer takes more than his fair share of the apple.
There can be no doubt that Australian smelting cos’,
charges and deductions are most unreasonable. Owners
answer the.assertion by saying. that the works do not
pay. If that be so the reason is that trade is not
encouraged. . Expensive staffs have to be maintained
While works are run at half capacity for the want of ore.
When big works were established in N.S.W. it was sup-
posed that a fillip would be given to mining for smelting
ores, but the reverse has been the case. The smelting
co.’s do not give a small man a ghost of a show. Their
purchase statements are longer than a lawyer’s bill of
costs, and every line of them means so much grab. The
copper miner of to-day, for example, is much worse off
than he was 20 years ago. He could then get better
terms from the late Lewis Lloyd—who was not likely to
make contracts which meant a loss to himself—than he
can get from the big co.’s of to-day. With copper at £53
per ton a miner dare not consign less than 16 per
cent. ore. The smelter’s initial deduction of two
units for assumed loss is an outrage. There is no
such loss. If slags were to show more than % per
cent, copper furnacemen would soon get the shoot.
Then the charge of 2s. 6d. per unit—or £l2 10s. per ton of
copper—for realisation is simply barefaced robbery.
Contracts can be made in Sydney any day in the week for
the disposal of copper at a returning charge of from £4 to
£5. It is doubtful whether State smelting works would
get over the difficulty. There would always be the risk
of failure through the appointment of incompetent
managers. Mining is excluded from Commonwealth
authority—why, no one seems to know. Were it other-
wise, it would he a desirable thing for the Commonwealth
to establish an up-to-date mining school. Connected with
it there should be a complete smelting-plant, which,
worked on fair commercial lines, would more than pay
for itself, and would, at the same time, give students
practical demonstrations of different processes of infin-
itely more value to them than all the text-books that
were ever printed or lectures delivered.—E» B.]
At Poverty Point.
Now announced that Amy Oastles has entered into a
fresh contract with J. C. Williamson, and is to tour

interruption of vitally-necessary studies ?
A farewell “At Home" was to be tendered—“tendered”
is the right word just here—to Grace Palotta, at Melb.
Athenaeum Hall, on Tuesday afternoon of this week—
“ At Homes ” run in all shapes, but they rarely take the
form of a benefit for anyone outside. The Palottian
function, which had Canon Tucker on the Committee,
was announced as “in aid of the poor of South Yarra,”
the proceeds of a small charge for admission being
dedicated to the cause. If the poor of Souih Yarra got
the whole of the takings at the doors it was well and
good, but if the expenses were deducted—well, then the
promotresses were merely obtaining Grace for their own
glorification in the sacred name of Charity.
Gerardy, who came so quietly to Melbourne last year
that his immediate success was rather remarkable, will
this time be introduced with a “welcome” at Merizies’

pearance at the Town Hall in the evening or next
evening. On dit that the brilliant musician has a Sydney

“ Melb.” : I don’t say that the worthy and musical
Father Robinson meant to drive Amy Castles on to an
operatic career, but his actions have had that effect, an
outcome which would in most cases be viewed with

she will never have cause to regret leaving the humble

the theatre engages her.

Slapoffski’s orchestral conducting reminds one of Wil-
son Barrett as Hamlet, only that he acts ever so much
harder, with nods, and becks, and wreathed smiles ; also
frowns and whispers, while his favorite trick to secure a

his Hebraic nose.
“ E.F.” : Jimmy Atholwood is so good and persevering
an actor that it were a pity to let him be overpraised in
the dailies without telling him of his one notable defect.
Originally handicapped by a weak voice, Atholwood, in
making a specialty of old-man impersonations, has de-
veloped a certain fruity fulness of tone, but his enuncia-
tion is sadly lacking in keenness. He talks so like an
ancient that one can’t always catch the words. Wilson
Barrett, who pitches the voice higher, is frequently in-
distinct because of his naturally hollow rumbling utter-
ances, and Atholwood seems to have adopted the
same sort of old-age tone instead of striving for a more
penetrative effect. A few lessons in singing, from a good
teacher, might serve to get the artistic Jimmy’s voice out
of its present groove.
A London correspondent, one of the most competent
and honest of men, writes to a Sydney friend re
Australian vocalists visiting England : “ There is an im-
pression in Australia that it is difficult to get a hearing in
London. Nothing is easier. A few pounds will enable
an aspirant to get up his or her own concert at the
Beehstein or Steinway Halls—as easily and as cheaply
as at the Y.M.O.A. Hall in Sydney. Every week,
almost every day, we have a first appearance an-
nounced—it generally being also the last. It is hard to
conceive how self - measurement can be so inaccu-
rate, but much responsibility lies with those whe
send misleading reports to Australia. If by false
report it can be made believed that a well-known
Australian mediocrity has achieved a success in London,
it is easy to understand why so many Sydney and Mel-
bourne nonentities come here to do likewise. ’ Successful
Australians, and others of means or position here, have
to put up with much begging from their stranded com-
patriots. A few weeks ago an impudent paragraph
appeared in the columns of the British Australasian,
deprecating these ill-advised visits to Europe. Now, the
B.A. is the author itself of most of the mischief. Here is
a specimen par. : ‘ Miss sang with great success at
the Orchestral Concert on Thursday last. On the
previous Saturday she appeared at , and to-day
she is engaged to sing at a reception,’ &c., <fcc. These
trumpery engagements mean absolutely nothing, but
the young lady in question has money, and can possibly
afford to delude herself into believing she is making a
career. I was present at her first appearance, three years
ago. It was a dismal failure, and I absolutely refuse to
believe she has had one genuine payable engagement
since. Again, Mr. Arthur Deane has done well enough
with the Carl Rosa Opera co. to have been spared the
following paltry puff : ‘ Indeed, for sheer vocal quality
it is doubtful if Mr. Deane has any equal in England.’
The merest tyro in musical matters knows what a wild
statement that is. Finally—well, I could give many other
instances of the same sort of thing, but have no desire to
tread on too many people’s toes.”
“ Cupid ” : Would like to know if it is usual with Sydney
women to remove their boots in places of amusement.
Have lately sat next to three women who doffed either
one or both boots in the theatre, resuming the feet-
envelopes when the play was near an end. Presumably
it is an epidemic of tight boots (if the microbe of tight
boots could be traced and extirpated the world would be
much the better). All these women had reasonably
small feet (which suggests that they took off their boots
through vanity), and in two cases they had holes in their
stockings (which suggests that they didn’t, unless the
whiteness of the foot showing through the hole was what
they were proud of).
Alfred Moul—formerly of Melbourne—is the latest
chairman of the Alhambra (London) directorate.
Unknowingly to himself, Canon Ellacombe (England)
has put a big nail in the coffin of the Shacon Bakespeare
theory. He points out, in a recently-published book of
reminiscences, that the great dramatist is entirely silent
on architecture of every description. Of the ‘stately
edifices of England, Troy, Rome and Venice he never
offers so much as the slightest sketch ; whereas, to Bacon,
stately buildings were a delight. The latter has left us
the grand essay “ On Building,” which not only shows
his practical knowledge in joining stateliness and beauty
with perfect comfort, but also shows how the greatest
intellect can deal with what many would call only petty
details. Henry Irving relies on the fact that, in his
plays, Shakespeare was a master of exits and entrances—
matters about which Bacon could not know anything.

HEALTH
A RE WORDS OE GOLDEN COUNSEL. Those who accept them when in need are wise in their generation. No man knoweth
\ what the hour may bring forth ; the happiness that is his may be short-lived ; the morrow may be tragic with pain, misery and ill-
bealth When disease has entered the human citadel, Life receives a check until it is driven out. The great benefactors to humanity,
the skilled Specialists and Scientists of the age, are the SPECIALISTS of the FREEMAN and WALLACE INSTITUTE. They
have benefited more sufferers and saved more martyrs to disease during the long years they have practised in Australasia than any
association of medical men. A testimonial from a grateful patient proves professional skill. The Specialists have thousands.
If it is your ambition to gain riches, guard your health —it is the greatest pearl of all. What are riches to you if you have
Chronic Kidney Disease ? Even sovereigns suffer. Poverty is the train-bearer of Disease. Prosperity and Plenty are the servants of
Health. A symptom is Nature’s sign of a formulating evil in the body; the Wise Man acts upon it at once, and the Wise Physician
and Specialist loses no opportunity to dispel that symptom by curing the disease.
PPINESS
Cause and Effect.
DISEASE is the cause of a departure from Health. Pain, re-
morse, endless misery is the effect of that cause. Thousands
of people say daily “if they had only known "they might have
escaped so-and-so. Then where a valuable life is threatened,
disease should be averted, and the life saved. INSOMNIA,
DYSPEPSIA, INDIGESTION, PALPITATION, EPILEPSY,
GOUT, HYSTERIA, SCIATICA, RHEUMATISM, LUM-
BAGO, FUNCTIONAL and ORGANIC NERVE DISEASES,
all claim yearly victims. Yet all these diseases are cured by the
SPECIALISTS of the FREEMAN and WALLACE INSTI-
TUTE, and cured daily.
Q
~aC
One Testimony.
FROM many thousands this testimony is taken. This patient
tried the SPECIALISTS’ new ELECTRO-MEDICAL
TREATMENT, for his nerve and muscular system. This
is what it did for him :
“I have been wearing one of your Electric 1 In-
vigorators’ during training for various contests
in Sydney, and have found it most beneficial,
both to my nerve and muscular systems. I desire
to state that your Electro-Medical treatment has
done me undoubted good.”
(signed) Q. JOHN 3.
Champion Lightweight of Australia.
This patient can be interviewed concerning the merits of this
wonderful instrument.
Three Physicians to the Late Honored Queen declared
ITU.EOTRIOITY to be a valuable aid to medicine to counteract the ravages of grave nerve and functional disorders. The same instruments, medically electrical, used by these
ii IMPERIAL PHYSICIANS, Drs. HOLLAND, LOCOCK, and FERGUSON, are used by the SPECIALISTS of the FREEMAN & WALLACE INSTITUTE. They hold
certificates of efficacy which are unquestionable. The high-grade ‘ ‘ INVIGOR ATOR, ” sold at £lO, contains two ounces 18ct. gold, which is in itself worth £B. The £1 instrument is specially
recommended. Worn round the loins for a few hours nightly, the curative, soothing, electric current enters and re-animates them, giving the necessary; vitality, the absence of which is the
chief cause of many grave functional nerve disorders. Reconstructive medicines, taken in unison with the electric application, cure many persistent diseases classed as “incurable.”

fered severely from Liver Complaint, contracted
during my tour of service with my Regiment in

A Hospital Patient writes:—
‘ ‘ The Military Hospital, Whittington Barracks,
“ Lichfield, May 24, 1901.
“Dear Sirs, —I have been very ill in bed three
weeks to-morrow, suffering from some Kidney
Complaint. My body is considerably swollen
whilst in bed, but on standing up the swelling
immediately appears in the legs ; my face is also
puffy, and, in fact, water appears to be all over
my body. I have just returned from abroad, and
believe the climate has been the cause of my ill-
ness. Seeing your advertisement, I resolved to
write you for your Powder to see if it will relieve
me.—Yours truly,
“W. H. WILTON
“ (Corporal), Army Service Corps.”
♦
“Same Address, June 2, 1901.
“Dear Sirs, —I am extremely thankful to you
for the Powder. I have tried it, and feel sure it
has worked a cure. After the first dose I was
glad to notice the swellings slightly diminish, the
second dose still further improved my condition,
the third dose entirely removed the swellings, and
on the doctor examining me he marvelled at the
result. By continuance I feel sure that I shall be
quite well again. How to thank you sufficiently
I do not know, but I am sure of this, that
‘ KUTNOW’S POWDER is an excellent remedy
for any Kidney Complaint.’ I will do my best to
recommend it to all my chums, who often suffer
from these complaints, especially after returning
from abroad. —Believe me, yours faithfully,
“W. H. WILTON,
“(Corporal), Army Service Corps.”
READ WHAT SIR JOHN B. MONCKTON
(Town Clerk of London) writes •
Guildhall, London, November 4th, 1901.
** Gentlemen.— l have much satisfaction in stating that for the last two years I have regu-
larly used KUTNOW’S POWDER with the result that troublesome and frequent attacks of
Lumbago and other Gouty Symptoms that troubled me for years, seem to have entirely
disappeared. Yours truly, JOHN B. MONCKTON.”
Constantly Used by the Royal Family.
KUTNOW’S POWDER is doubly efficient in Rheumatism and Gout. It dissolves
uric acid and phosphatic sediments as well as other products difficult of elimination, while at the
same time it exerts a moderately stimulant effect upon the renal cells, and thereby facilitates the
swift removal of insoluble materials from the body. Without such actions insoluble sub-
stances will precipitate in the kidneys and bladder. The intense suffering produced by stone, together with
consecutive pyelitis and cystitis, are avoided by prompt elimination. Unquestionably, although the speedy
removal of uric acid and other products of faulty tissue change is of conspicuous benefit, yet to pre-
vent their formation is a service still more important. This service is performed
by KUTNOW’S POWDER when it corrects those digestive failures which are re-
sponsible for the production of deleterious materials.—Fide Medical Record, Sept., 1901.
Procrastination in applying a safe and efficient remedy may mean incom-
prehensible mischief to those who suffer from derangement of the digestive or
excretory organs. Success in business or the professions, or in any walk in life,
depends very largely upon the state of health. Men who work with the brain
value health, and men who value health take KUTNOW’S POWDER. Any
one of the ailments mentioned above may develop into serious disease unless
checked in time. A Sluggish Liver, for instance, produces mental depression,
clogs up the bile-ducts, brings on a bilious condition, and creates excessive uric
acid. Excessive uric acid contaminates the blood, and breeds Gout, Rheu-
matism, Sciatica, and congests the kidneys. Congested kidneys bring on Stone
in the Bladder, Diabetes, Bright’s Disease, and vesical irritations generally.
KUTNOW’S POWDER is simply invaluable in the treatment of these
derangements, and will restore the bloom of vigorous health to the most debili-
tated patient. It is an exact reproduction of the famous medicinal merits of
the waters of the European Spas, minus any of their drastic or lowering
properties.
Beware of Fraudulent Imitations.
KUTNOW’S POWDER may be obtained in capsuled bottles, of all Chemists and Medi-
cine Vendors. See that the Registered Trade Mark, “ Hirschensprung ” (or Deer Leap), and
the autograph facsimile signature, “S. KUTNOW AND Co. (Ld. ), are on the label and oarton.
ONLY THESE ENSURE GENUINENESS. INSIST ON “ KUTNOW’S,” AND
FIRMLY REFUSE ANY SUBSTITUTES; THEY ARE WORTHLESS AND OFTEN
INJURIOUS.
Convincing
Testimony.
The Dean of Birmingham, Medical College
(B. L. Wyman, M.D., Ph. Cr.), writes—
“ July 2nd, 1901.
“Gentlemen, —I have to say that I have tried
KUTNOW’S POWDER, and am pleased to say
the results have been very satisfactory. I have
been a sufferer for the past two years, and have
been greatly improved since I began the use of
your Powder. I mention this simply that you
may know how highly I think of the value of your
Powder in Uric-acid Diseases, Gout, Rheumatism,
and Kidney Troubles. I have also prescribed
KUTNOW’S POWDER with the greatest suc-
cess.—Yours truly,
“ B. L. WYMAN, M.D. (Dean).”

A Lincoln Vicar writes—
“ Holland Pen Vicarage, Lincoln, Oct. 22.
Dear Sirs, —For many years I have suffered
from what an eminent physician of Guy’s Hos-
pital told me was Incipient Gout, the effect of
uric acid in the joints. I have derived great bene-
fit from KUTNOW’S POWDER, the cracking
and grating of my joints has ceased, and I have
lost the feeling of fatigue.—Yours truly,
“(Rev.) JOHN SMITH (Vicar).”
A Derbyshire Vicar writes—
“ Whitfield Vicarage, Glossop, Derby.
“Dear Sirs,—l consider KUTNOW’S POW-
DER invaluable, and have again and again found
it of the utmost service, and would not be without
it willingly. It has recently cleared off some
Rheumatism which had troubled me. lam con-

The Battler’s Love-Story.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Did I ever tell ye me love-story?” said the
Battler. “ One night as I wus travellin’ up the
Western line bound fer Bourke—l lived at Bourke
then something went wrong with the lightin’ of
the car, and, bein’ in darkness, I couldn’t see me
fellow-passengers. ”
“ I don’t suppose you could,” chipped in the
hotel jester.
“ Howld yer m tg,” said the Battler; “Tm
tell in’ the story. Well, to continue the yarn.
When the train reached Katoomba, I thought I
cud make out the dim outline of a woman seated
at t’other end of the compartment—so I does a
little cough ; she coughed back .”
“ What then ?” said the hotel jester impatiently.
“Can’t yer hold yer howlin’ox-tongue?” said the
Battler, “ After a while she gets ter coughing
very bad and confidential-like, and I coughs re-
sponsive-like. I thought if we coughed at each
other often enough it might lead up to a con-
versation. When the train reached Lithgow I
ventured on tellin’ ’er about th’ necessity of keep-
ing the winder closed with such a bad cough, and
she played right into me hands; she arsked me to
close it for ’er.”
“ So you closed it ? ” said the jester.
“ If yer don’t stop interruptin’, I’ll fling this beer
over yer. After I closed the winder I took a seat
about a yard away from ’er. And when the train
passed a few more stations I ventured to edge up
against ’er.”
“Did yer?” said the public-house jester.
‘ ‘ Go-ter-’ell and don’t come back, for interruptin’.
Then I started toyin’ with ’er ’ands and after-
wards moved one arm round ’er waist, at the same
time givin’ ’er a little squeeze.”
“ Didn’t think yer had it in yer,” said the
jester.
“Ah ! that was when I was younger, and had
the fire of love in me. She was bound for Bourke,
too, so I arsked to see’er’ome. When we reached
our destination, I wus dead square with ’er. At
Bourke, we used to meet of an evenin’ and go for
walks tergether, and make love. I suppose you’ve
all made love some time or other ? ”
“ How do you do it ?” said the jester.
“ Don’t show yer howlin’, devastatin’ igno-
rance,” said the Battler. “ Well, one evening she
proposes that I marry ’er, and, likin’ her, I fixed
the day. When the weddin’ mornin’ came round
I sent a boy to ask ’er her full name, which I for-
got to inquire before. ”
“ Did she tell yer it?” said the hotel humorist,
excitedly.
“Shut up, will yer!” answered the Battler.
“The boy came back and told me’er name was
Mulligan. Then I starts thinkin’ about havin’
seen ’er face before, an’ it struck me, her name
bein’ Mulligan, the same asmeself, she might be a
relation or somethin’. An’then I began thinkin’
about a wife I once had. ‘Damn it,’ says I, ‘ she’s
the same identical as I wus hitched to ten years
ago. I remember —she cleared out with another
fellow and took all the furniture and me shirts
and Bs. 6d.’ ”
“ And did the wedding come off as arranged ? ”
inquired the funny man in impatience.
i'he Battler said nothing. He rose up and hit
the funny man hard on the jaw.

ALTHOUGH our Stocks are the finest and best-selected, and displayed by us in the most handsome Stores
in Australasia, don’t for a moment think that our Stores are too grand for you, or that you
can get more for your money in a smaller place. If you do think so you make a big mistake,
and the sooner you give us the opportunity to prove that this is so the better will it be for you.
Does it not stand to reason that we, with our six popular Australasian stores (two more will be opened
in a couple of months, one in Brisbane and the other in Dunedin, N.Z.) can buy in larger quantities and sell at
lower prices than single shops ? Is not the possession of these six stores proof that our prices please the public ?
Next time you want anything in our line, come in and see how well and how cheaply we can supply your
wants. It will cost you nothing to look round and get all the information you want, and even if you don’t buy

The eruption at Martinique came so swiftly
that search parties found the sentries at the
Governor’s residence erect and with their rifles
still in their hands. This is accounted for by the
assumption that the noxious gases brought instant
asphyxiation. The beautiful legend of Pompeii
re the stern, unflinching Roman soldier who,
rather than desert his post, remained there to die,
can now be consigned to oblivion with the other
exploded fairy tales of history. Probably lie
hadn’t time to run away.
Some time ago Wellington (M.L.) City
Council determined to furnish that wet, windy
city of narrow streets and muddy roads with an
electric tram service. Levels were taken and
elaborate plans prepared, when the. work was
suddenly hung up by an “ Order-in-Council.”
Meanwhile there are weird stories about wealthy
British and Yankee syndicates offering “splendid
terms” for a concession. The municipal authori-
ties have laid it down as a fundamental rule that
in future all public services shall belong to the
municipality, so they seem to be right; but the
people are wondering if the syndicate has managed
to nobble someone higher up. That mysterious
Order-in-Council is causing honest burghers to lose
sleep o’ nights.
HAVE YOU
A BAD LEO
with Wounds that Discharge or otherwise, perhaps sur-
rounded with inflammation and swollen that when you
press your finger on the inflamed part it leaves the impres-
sion ? If so, under the skin you have poison that defies all
the remedies you have tried, which, if not extracted, you
never can recover, but go on suffering till death releases
you. Perhaps your knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated; the same with the ankles, round which the skin
may be discoloured, or there may be wounds ; the disease
if allowed to continue will deprive you of the power to
walk. You may have attended various hospitals and had
medical advice, and been told your case is hopeless, or
advised to submit to amputation ; but do not, for I CAN
CURE YOU. I don’t say perhaps ; but I WILL. Because
others have failed is no reason for not now being cured.

THE HARP-O-GHORD.
HARMONICA or MOUTH-HARP and ZITHER

THE tone of the harp enters directly into the body of the instrument and

twice as loud as both Mandolin and Guitar. Any Mouth Harp player
can play the Harp-o-Chord on sight, and anyone can easily learn to play the
Mouth Harp. One person can furnish music for Parties, etc., and for the
Serenade it has no equal with its beautiful tone and wonderful carrying
power. A Whole Band in One Instrument, and anyone can learn to play it.
No knowledge of music is required. The HARP-O-CHORD is an elegantly
finished, high-class instrument, sold at a price within the reach of all. Its
(/intensions are seventeen inches long by eight inches wide, weight 40 ounces.

i 'laying. Simply play the tune or air upon the Harp, and the accompaniment
on the strings. When the Chords are played upon the strings and the tune
Upon the harp, the voluminous tone of the combination surprises all. The

EVIDENCE OF WHICH IS DAILY RE-
CEIVED IN THE FORM OF TESTI-
MONIALS AND GRATEFUL LETTERS
BY
Herr RfISSMUSSEN
THE WORLD-FAMED DANISH
HERBALIST & BOTANIST,
PROPRIETOR OF THE
ALFALINE HERBAL REMEDIES
REGISTERED
A FEW WORDS TO THE UNINITIATED.
PERSONAL AND PERTINENT. —Those who have Dot met Herr Rassmussen, and
who have not given his Alfaline Herbal Remedies a trial, may find it beneficial to become
acquainted with the good work which lie has done in the interest of suffering humanity for
the last twenty years.
ALONG BACK IN THE BEGINNING OF THE EIGHTIES
Herr Rassmussen introduced his now world-famed Alfaline Herbal Remedies to the Australian public at 547 George
Street, Sydney. Australia was then flooded with American importations and proprietary remedies, manufactured
by doubtful persons with assumed names and fictitious addresses, who took the people’s money without
responsibility, and very often without giving them fair value for same.
HERR RASSMUSSEN BROUGHT ABOUT A REVOLUTION
by straightforward and fair dealings with the public, offering to stake his reputation and future if his remedies
were not as efficacious as he claimed them to be, accepting all responsibility, and willing to abide by the people’s
verdict.
THE HAPPY RESULT IS KNOWN TO EVERYONE.
Over twenty years have passed away, hundreds of remedies have come and gone—many of them were forced on
the public in numerous designing ways—thousands of pounds spent on advertising same with the assistance of the
world’s grea f est experts in laying traps for the unwary ; but the public would have none of them, and they have
disappeared as suddenly as a flash of lightning.
“THE ALFALINE REMEDIES EXCELL ALL OTHERS,”
and are well known to be more popular to-day than they have ever been. They have not only obtained, but
have retained the goodwill and confidence of the Australian public, and have become famous throughout the
civilized world. The first Sydney Office not only yet exists, but offices have been opened up for their sale at
Melbourne, Bri-bane, Adelaide, Wellington, N.Z., and in West Australia at Perth, Fremantle, Kalgoorlie and
Boulder City, with Agencies throughout the world.
LET THE PUBLIC JUDGE FROM THE FOLLOWING:—
The Alfaline Remedies have held their own for over twenty years in Australia, and Herr Rassmussen has
been awarded the Parisian Acadamies’ Gold Medal and Diploma of Honour ; Gold Medal, Sydney, and several Silver
Medals; honourably mentioned in almost every newspaper in Australia; received many thousands of unsolicited
testimonials—every one of the originals open for inspection at his Offices. The Alfaline Remedies hare never been
known to fail to cure in a single instance.
ARE THEY NOT WORTH A TRIAL?
if they are, why not try them today? why leave it till to-morrow and, perhaps, lose your chance and time? No
order so small that it is not welcome ; no order so large that it cannot be executed at onoe. If you first wish

Beanie’s Bronchitis Cure.
XHB FAMOUS REMEDY FOR
COUGHS, BRONCHITIS, ASTHMA, AND CONSUMPTION,
HAS THE LARGEST SALE OF ANY CHEST MEDICINE IN AUSTRALIA.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of Bronchitis, Cough, Difficulty of Breathing, Hoarseness, Pain or
Soreness in the Chest, experience delightful and immediate relief; and to those who are subject to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it effects a Complete Cure. It is most com-
forting in allaying irritation in the throat and giving strength to the voice, and it neither allows a Cough or Asthma to become chronic, nor Consumption to develop. Consumption has
never been known to exist where “ Coughs ” have been properly treated with this medicine. No house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a Complete Cure is certain.
BEWARE OB' COUGHS!
REMEMBER THAT EVERY DISEASE HAS ITS COMMENCEMENT, AND CONSUMPTION IS NO EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE.
CONSUMPTION.
TOO ILL TO LEAVE HIS BED.
A COMPLETE CURE.
Mr. W. Ct. Hearne.—Dear Sir,—l am writing totell you
about the wonderful cure your medicine has effected in
my case. About three years ago I began to cough. At
first the cough was not severe, but it gradually.got worse,
and I became very weak and troubled with night sweats,
pain in my chest, and great quantities of phlegm. On
Beveral occasions there was blood in the expectorated
matter. I had been treated by a doctor, who pronounced
my case to be Consumption, and various other treatments
had been tried, but without benefit. It was at this stage
that I heard of your Bronchitis Cure, and sent to you for
a course of the medicine. When it arrived I was too ill to
leave my bed, but I commenced taking it at. once, and
gradually improved. lam glad to say that the two lots
of medicine you sent have effected a complete cure, for
which accept my very r best thanks. —Yours gratefully,
J. BLAIR.

Dear Sir. —I suffered from a severe cold on the chest,
with cough, for five years, and during that time got
treatment from different sources, but derived no benefit
until I used your Bronchitis Cure, which gave me relief
at once, and completely cured me. lam delighted with
it. It is a really wonderful medicine ; does good at once,
and “can’t be licked.”—Yours sincerely,

“ Dear Sir, —
Your letter and Bronchitis Cure to hand quite safe.
I am sure you will be glad to know that your Bronchitis
Cure has quite cured me. I was very glad when it came,
as I was suffering from a severe attack of Bronchitis at the
time it arrived. I had sent for my own doctor, but had
not had one night’s rest for a week. I started taking the
Bronchitis Cure three times a day as directed, and was
very much eased at once. At the end of a week I-only
took it twice a day, and then only every night fora
week, as I was so much better when, thanks to the Lord
for adding His blessing, I was quite well, and walked into
town and back without feeling any fatigue. I had not
done that previously for 12 months—always went in the
omnibus —as walking caused me such pain and distress in
the chest. I always walk now, and never feel it, and I
am stronger than 1 have been for years. I thank my son
for his great kindness in sending the medicine, and am,
dear Sir,
“Yours very truly,

THE DOCTOR SAID NOT FIING MORE COULD BE
DONE.
CURED BY HEARNE'S BRONCHITIS CURE.
The extract runs as follows: —“ As for myself, thank
the Lord, lam feeling stronger than I have for years. I
had an attack of Bronchitjs in November, but Hearne’s
Bronchitis Cure was again successful. I feel quite well,
and walk into town feeling quite strong.
“ I must ask you to send me six bottles more of the
medicine, as I wish to have a supply in the house. I
have tried to get it made up here, and let my chemist
have a bottle to see what he could do. He tells me this
week he can make nothing out of it, he never saw any-
thing like it before, so there is only one thing for me to
do—send for more. I have never kept in bed one day
since I commenced to take it. I used to be in bed a fort-
night at a time always, and after that for months I was
as weak as I could possibly be, and was always taking
cod liver oil, so you will see at once it is quite worth
while sending for it such a long distance.
“ Something more I must tell you. Charlotte has been
very ill since I wrote you. Her cough was so bad she
never had a night’s rest, and was spitting up blood
very much. The doctor told her husband that there was
nothing more he could do for her. So on the Sunday I
sent her half a bottle of the Bronchitis Cute, and told
her to try it, and if she did not use it, not to waste it,
but send it back again. She had such confidence in her
doctor that I thought she would not try it. On the
Wednesday I sent over again, and she was much better,
the night’s rest was very good, and cough and bleeding
from the lungs better. She sent for another half-bottle,
and on the following Sunday sent over to say that she
was quite cured and did not require any more medicine.
So you see what great good it has done, and she wishes
to have some of my next supply.”
12 Years’ Agony.
DISTRESSING, SUFFOCATING, DRY COUGH
ENTIRELY REMOVED BY FIVE DOSES.
NO OTHER TREATMENT COULD EVEN EASE IT.
“Sir.—My wife was for twelve years a sufferer from
a most distressing, suffocating, dry cough that could not
be removed or even eased by any remedy, doctors’
prescriptions and patent medicineshaving been tried;
but I am happy to say that the cough, pain in the chest,
and difficulty of breathing, etc., were entirely removed by
the fifth dose of your Bronchitis Cure. —I remain, Sir,
yours most respectfully,

Mr. W. G. Hearne.—Dear Sir, —Kindly send mo one
large bottle of your Bronchitis Cure. I a... more than
pleased with the results of your wonderful medicine, as a
small bottle cured my little girl, who had been suffering
for five years, and now I do not feel safe to be without it.

A Seven Years’ Case.
EXPECTORATING BLOOD AND MATTER.
COMPLETELY CURED.
“ Mr. W. G. Hearne.
“ Dear Sir, —Your medicine has cured me of bronchitfe
and asthma, from which I suffered for upwards of seven
years, during which period I was scarcely ever free from
coughs, and frequently the difficulty of breathing was so
distressing that for nights in succession I had to sit up.
I write you this acknowledgment from a sense of duty, as
in my case every other treatment had failed. For a year
previous I had been getting very much worse, and at the
time I obtained your medicine I was confined to bed
suffering from a most violent cough, expectorating blood
and matter, and apparently beyond hope of recovery.
The first dose of the medicine gave me welcome relief,
and I steadily improved as I continued the treatment,
until I became, as I am now, quite well. —Yours sincerely,
H. WALKER, Balmain, Sydney.”

PREVIOUS TREATMENT FAILED.
A SEVENTEEN YEARS’ CASE
CURED BY THREE BOTTLES.
Mr. Alex. J. Anderson, of Oak Park, Charleville,
Queensland, writes :—“After suffering from Asthma for
17 years, and having been under a great many different
treatments without benefit, I was induced to try Hearne’s
medicine for Asthma. After taking three bottles of this
medicine I quite got rid of the Asthma, and since then,
which was in the beginning of 1883— 15 years ago—l have
not had the slightest return of it. The medicine quite
cured me, and I have much pleasure in recommending it.”
Writing again on the 4th April, 1899, he states:—“l
am keeping very well now. Never have the slightest
return of the Asthma.”

A Miscalculation.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Harky’ Tiro rnlky was a farrrjer’s son. When Ins
father died he had no farm—a bank had it. Then
an uncle, who had been “in trade,” died and left
him a business he didn’t want; so he realised it
for cash down. Leaving the northern districts
of Victoria, he looked for another farm in a
moister climate. He lighted on Gippsland, and
there found all the moisture he required, but not
a farm that he had sufficient capital to buy. All
the good land was either in the hands of the
banks, of the men who had kept out of the banks,
or of land-jobbers who held for a rise. One place
of 500 acres almost reached his ideal. It was
between two creeks, which flowed about half-a-
rnile apart, and was bordered on one side, by the foot-
hills of a Baw Baw spur, undulating gently. The
heavy timber indicated unmistakably the quality
of the soil that nourished the great trees. His.
yeoman soul thrilled at the sight. The land was
owned by Henderson. He had held the land
many years, paid the taxes —and cursed his luck.
Men came and settled all round him, and he had
smiled at his prospective unearned increment
which never came. A railway was built within
five miles of him ; still the land did not rise one
shilling above what it cost to keep. A dozen pur-
chasers came and offered 3 per cent, on his bargain
—he wanted 30 per cent. At last when Thornley
came and offered him 10 per cent., he closed on
him with a snap. When the neighbors heard of
the bargain the only one who didn’t think Thorn-
ley a fool was himself. Henderson looked for-
ward with confidence to getting his land back,
plus the deposit of £3OO.
Harry bought the land at the end of the
Autumn. In the Spring, Henderson was cal-
culating on the chance of getting it again.
He saw 300 acres of trees already yellow from
ringbarking, and a dozen men pegging away at
the scrub. Sweet visions of Harry in a lunatic-
asylum softened his cynical smile, which became
almost jolly when lie heard the comments of the
neighbors. They told him Harry was mad, for
when the timber was dry, it would be twice as
costly to cut up for burning. That made him
anxious. And the quantity ! —Trees in battalions,
some of them nearly 300 ft. high, with scrub in
some places piled 10ft. high—and all dying.
In the middle of a small cleared patch was
Harry’s dwelling. Henderson looked at it curi-
ously. It was built entirely of sheet bark, includ-
ing the c.iimney. Besting on the outside -of the
bark were saplings ; from underneath the bark
protruded the ends of parallel saplings, which
were pegged together with wooden pegs. Even
the door was bark, hung on hinges of bark. There
was not a nail in the whole structure, and it was
built from end to end with only an axe and an
auger for tools. It looked neat and cool, and,
from his experience an hour before in the iron-
roofed gridiron of the next farm, Henderson could
not help thinking it looked sensible. But com-
mon sense was the last quality he came to see in
Harry, and he looked relieved when he saw there
was not a single head of stock or a farm imple-
ment on the place ; there were only a grindstone,
some axes, half-a-dozen pickaxes, and a dray.
He looked in vain for the horse.
The next deposit was due in a week, and he
might as well find out at once that Harry had it.
I’his was surely his right. When Harry came, he
was surprised to see no trace of anxiety in him.
He went at once to the point.
“I suppose you know, Mr. Thornley, your next
deposit is due on the 17th ? ”
He said it in a manner indicating that he was
sure Harry did not possess it.
“I am quite aware of that,” said Harry, in a
manner indicating that he was nettled. Hender-
-33 l thought he was blustering.
“Look here, Mr. Thornley, how many deposits
have you paid?”
“ As many as will pay for this land.”
“I suppose you know how much it will cost
you ? ”
“ Perfectly.”
“You showed me your bank-account of £1100.”
“Well?” .
“How much is it costing you to get all that
timber rung, and that scrub cut ? ”
“£500.”
“Then, when you have paid that, and me the
next deposit, you will have nothing left.”
“ Well ?”
“There’s no well about it. It’s all wrong. It
will cost me £6OO to get all that dead timber
away.”
“ Cost you ? ”
“Yes, cost me; for, mind me, if you cannot
pay me the final £1125, the land is mine again six
months from now.”
“ Meanwhile, it is my property, isn’t it ? ”
“Well?”
“Well, just you get off it, before I kick you
off !”
Henderson looked like a vicious cat at the
brawny farmer, then went quickly. Harry
smiled as he reflected that a man might have two
1 tanking accounts, and that he was not going to
be “ stuck ” for the final payment.
Two years befo e Harry had bought Hender-
son’s property, the seasons had set in dry, a third
followed, and a fourth promised to be as dry as
the previous three. Gippsland felt the drought
less severely than the rest of the province ; but it
told even there; although the grass was nearly as
plentiful as in fatter seasons, it was dry earlier,
and the ringed timber was dead sooner.
With outraged feelings to stir his mind, Hen-
derson noted these things, till they suggested a
manner of revenge, which would ruin Harry, by
destroying all the timber, which he evidently
reckoned on selling to meet his payments, and
also give him back his land for another gullible
young man to buy. Nothing in the world was
safer. For six months he slept and dreamt
pleasantly on the idea, till he confirmed himself
in his purpose.
For three days it was cool with southerly winds ;
the fourth was calm; the fifth warm with easterly
winds; the sixth hot with northerly winds; on
the seventh and eighth it was blazing,
On the ninth a fire broke out. Henderson was
high up the valley when it started, through his
absent-mindedly dropping a lighted match. He
tried his best to put it out, but the grass was high,
the dead-leaves thick, and the wind strong. In
10 minutes 20 acres of scrub were blazing ; in 20
minutes the forest was roaring ; in three more it
had leaped the road in front of Harry’s property,
and was into his dead scrub and timber.
At the first sign of smoke Harry and his men
made for the East Greek. When they reached it
the fire was already pouring over the road. The
green scrub on the creek banks began to hiss and
shrivel in the heat; they started crawling,
chokingly, up the hill, and when they reached tne
top, lay there, gasping and panting. They were
joined in half-an-hour by Henderson and two
of his friends. All looked silently.over the blazing
valley. They were blackened and scorched
with - the heat and smoke, but forgot
their burns in the awe of the magnificent
sight at their feet. Huge tongues of flame
leaped like great yellow snakes into the sky ; falling
trees every.moment threw jets of sparks high into
the air, as they crashed to the ground, ihose
which stood were huge fire columns, with ragged
banners of flame streaming to leeward, thrashing
out streams of fie v sparks into the wind. Hour
after hour they sat on the hill, till darkness fell,
when every spark and every gleaming coal added
its light to make, the night as bright as day.
Harry’s land shone out more brightly than all the
rest by reason of the dry wood on it; it was like
one great glowing coal.
Henderson watched his mischief with something
like terror gripping his heart, wondering where it
would end. Onwards and sideways flew the fire,
spreading till nothing but fire and smoke could be
seen climbing every hill within sight. When the
sun rose, and its rays did their best to penetrate
the smoky haze above them, they showed not a
single tree, nor a stick of scrub standing on
Harry’s land ; it was as clear as if a gigantic
sickle had gone over it. Even the creek banks
were bare. On the neighboring farms that could
be seen at all, only a few of the most vigorous of
the green trees were s anding. They were leafless
columns of ebony, and all the scrub beneath them
had been swept away.
It was one of Harry’s workmen who first began
to reckon up the effects. “What about your
fences, boss ? ”
“They had to be rebuilt, anyway.
“ But the hut ? ’’
“ I can replace it with a house. It only cost a
week’s work.” ,
“ The tools though ?”
“£5 will replace them.”
“ And our clothes ? ”
“ I will fit you out again.”
One of Henderson’s friends who had been
listening, turned to Harry and said in surprise,
“But doesn’t this mean nearly ruin to you, Mr.
Thornley ? ”
“Ruin ! It’s simply made me. I gave £3 ss.
an acre for the land, and it’s worth £lO now.
Then he turned and looked at Henderson.
“I’ve got your money ready when it is due. I’d
have started the fire myself if someone else hadn’t
done it.” When he saw Henderson’s expression
he laughed.
W. BRENTA.
A Man’s Love.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ I thought it only fair to tell you,” the man was
saying. “ I don’t think you really do care much.”
“It was only fair,” the woman answered,
quietly. “And it was only natural that you
should grow tired. I will say ‘ good-bye 5 now.”
“Oh, well, not ‘good-bye’”! He was in an
awkward position, and unreasonably felt irritated
at her calmness. “We shall see each other some-
times, I hope. ”
“Yes, certainly—if you wish it.”
* * * *
“She does not care a scrap,” he thought. “I
am almost sorry I released her.”
“I love him! I shall always love him!” she
kept repeating to herself; “ and he is tired of me.
Ah, fool! fool that I was to lose his love—that to
me is the dearest thing in life ! But he is a man,
and I ought to have remembered it. But I will
remember it now, and now, when I regain his
love, I shall keep it while life lasts! And,” she
sighed, “ now for work ! Music instead of study ;
dressmaking instead of writing.”
* » * *
“ How strange ! ” he muttered, as he watched
the dancers. “ How strange that she should come
out like this ! She was so quiet and demure all
the time we were engaged, and now—why ! she is
flirting outrageously.” He gnawed his moustache
in anger as he watched his cast-off love—the belle
among numerous beauties—graciously receiving
the homage of many men, when he felt some-
how that she ought to be pining in some lonely
corner. “ She did not care, after all/’ he groaned.
“ May I have your programme ? ” he asked boldly,
although in his heart lie expected a refusal.
“Certainly,” she answered sweetly; and a
while afterwards they floated along in a divine
waltz. “She is beautiful,” he thought; “ I believe
I love her more than ever I did, but I know she
does not love me now—if ever she really did.”
“How can I bear it?” she thought. “His
touch almost kills. I wish I could love him less.”
“You are happy to-night,” he whispered.
“The men are crazy about you.”
“ Yes,” she answered. “And you ?”
“Just now,” he said, with an admiring glance
straight into her eyes. Then—“ Are you glad
that we parted ? ”
“Oh yes ! our engagement was all a mistake,”
with a sweet smile.
“ The parting was a mistake,” he murmured;
and wondered what meant that inscrutable smile
that played around her lips.
* * * *
“The way to win a man’s love,” said the
woman, “ is to win other men’s admiration.”
“Can you never forgive me?” he whispered to
the brilliant woman who had been charming the
company with her singing, and dazzling them
with her beauty. “You never look at me since
you have all these men at your feet. I have loved
you so long, and, even in face of your repeated
refusals, I love you more than ever ! ”
“ Because of them ! ” she murmured to herself.
But letting her eyes rest on his with all the long-
suppressed lovelight shining through them, she
said, softly : “ Hugh, Ido forgive you ; but oh !
it is too la'e—now—for both of us.”
“ Why too late ? ” he cried, eagerly.
“Because—l have promised to marry Mr.
Grey.”
“The way to keep a man’s love,” said the
woman, with a pathetic little smile, “is to put
yourself beyond hrs reach.”

From 3400 tons in 1899-1900 S. Aus.
local production of artificial manures has got to
10,500 tons in 1901-2. Imports in the same time
have moved from 21,200 to 27,000 tons ; so there
is still room for local development. In the “ seed-
ing ” season just finished the S.A. farmer has
spent £173,000 on fertiliser; 10 years ago he
knew no more about phosphates than he did
about Sanscrit. The State, whose experts boomed
the business, early passed a law requiring the
sampling of the home product, as well as every
shipment offered ; and, though last year it cost
only £B5 to administer, the Act is said to do its
work. The average “dressing” of fertiliser is
about 851 b. per acre.
Good Blood
Good blood is the secret of life—and the secret of
good blood is Dr. Williams’Pink Pills for Pale People
Good blood is the source of all health. It is the
greatest enemy that disease can have.
Good blood makes you less liable to disease of
every kind. It strengthens and stimulates every
organ in your body to throw off any ailment that
may attack it.
Good blood is the only positive cure for such com-
plaints as indigestion, anaemia, palpitation, decline,
neuralgia, rheumatism and skin eruptions—because
these diseases cannot exist where the blood is pure
and strong.
Good blood means health, vigor, life and beauty—
and the one sure way to make your blood good is to
take Dr Williams’ Pink Pills, the great blood-builder
and nerve tonic.
These little blood-building pills have saved lives
that doctors and nurses despaired of. They have
cured thousands of others —and they will cure you too.
How they cured Miss Ellen Evans. Mr. Harry
Evans is a well-known engineer living at Portland, near
;V! udgee, N.S.W. Three years ago his daughter began to ail.
She could scarcely eat or sleep. Sharp pains in her face and
limbs often made her scream with agony. The doctors said
she was suffering from biliousness, acute neuralgia and gen-
eral weakness—but doctors’medicines and patent medicines
failed to relieve her. Then she tried Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
for Pale People, and t hey cured her like magic. They built up
her blood supply and toned her nervous system. In a few
weeks the distressing biliousness and neuralgic pains vanished,
her appetite returned, and she slept soundly. Her cure was
positive and complete. Indeed, Miss Evans is now a strong
and healthy girl—full of life and spirits. And thisis just one
case out of thousands.

Brawling.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Stir in the street and clamor in the dark ;
Swirl of hot brows and deep li ps cursing white •
Blood where the red knife left its plunging mark,’
Death on the brown cheeks, something still and
stark,
Slain for the honor of our mistress of a night.
Struth, he, a bastard of the Dago-swine,
Full from the wine-press, savage in the flush
Of a madness leaping, eyes aflame, ashine,
Leered to the Glory of the Boulevard divine;
Snatched at her red lips with a reeling rush !
Daring greatly, swift he took her close and hard,
Ere our lips could blast him or a blade might
stay.
With his arms entwining, could he see tp guard,
Death that swooned upon him, in the clamor evil-
starred,
Clutching at his heart-strings as he broke away ?
Sweet in the noon of night, full of tingling stars,
She, best of all the world, called us down the
stair;
We. froth of all the world, faces chained with scars,
Foul from the beaten deck and the clanging spars,
Followed down the streetway, playing with her
hair.
She had flashing fingers, browning in the grime
(Lord, we loved her full eyes, drowsy eyes and
deep !)
Was our kin a danger ? Was our love a crime ?
Is her scarlet story blazoned ’gainst the walls of
Time ?
If her God forsake, we at least will guard and
keep !
To a hell with such things, she is ours alone !
Keen the dagger edges when the slighting word
is said,
He, the thirsty giant, ere the kiss had colder
grown,
Felt the fine ton of an arm savagely up-thrown,
Caught the reeling stroke that split the chestnut
head.
Stir in the street, a-dying down and still—
Now for her honor dear he hath other ways,
Where the wings of Silence lean for ever, full of
ill,
Past the outer, outer sunlight to the deep in-
visible—
Ha ! to see her shrinking, and her sleeping eyes
ablaze !
Hear her laughing, laughing, with her love about
them all,
Praising his swift prowess—and his joy is fin 6
to see !
As he leans against her, straight and staunch and
tall,
Blushing to her deep eyes when the loving glances
fall.
Ah, the place of all proud places where the
bravest fain would be !
Where the bravest fain would be, he shall bask
the summer night,
In the splendour of her favor (who shall swear
’twere bitter-sweet ?)
There to list her lavish praises in a wonderful
delight;
With his beard against her forehead, golden-
brown against the white,
Where the time and place for thought of the
dead eyes in the street ?

The Track-Horse.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ I never travelled with a horse but once,” said
Tarkalson, “an’l don’t want-any-more-~of-him-.-
He’s a nuisance on a dry track—an’ they’re all dry
out back. Yer always askin’ about grass, an’
lookin for grass 5 an’ when you’ve got grass
there s bound to be no water. I reckon a horse-
man’s never troubled with want o’ work or tucker
—his greatest concern is finding grass. When he
strikes a patch he’s got to hobble-out whether he
likes it or not. Then, instead of feedin’ to keep
his condition up, the brute goes ramblin’ about,
takin a mouthful about every ten yards. You
think he’s makin’ off, an’ turn him back. When
you’re asleep he’ll go some other way—you don’t
know where. Best way is not to turn him back
at all. If he’s a rambler, hobble him short, or
side-line him with a bullock-chain. In the mornin’
you’ll see his track. Of course you’ll know where
to find him —at the other end of it.
“A good campih’-horse is like a good mate—
he’s precious scarce. Mostly you’re up all night
listenin for the bell, an’ it’s surprisin’ what a
variety of sounds resembles that bell o’ your’n.
It’s a burden 011 yer mind all night. In the morn-
ing, you go to ketch him—where you heard his
bell just before daylight—an’ he ain’t there. You
walk back 10 miles, to the last gate you come
through, an’ find him with his head hangin’
over the fence. You’ve tramped a day’s
journey after him—if he’s broke his hob-
bles, you run yerself blind ketchin’ him,
an you lead him a day’s journey to camp. Then
you start. Many a poor devil starts goin’ mad.
Someone’s ratted him, p’raps, while he’s been
away ; or crows an’ dogs have copped his tucker ;
or the wind’s set the fire blazin’ an’ burnt every-
thing. A horse is right enough where there’s whips
of grass, an’ water every mile. He travels more
at night-time then.
“This cuddy of mine was a pot-gutted bay.
Called him Nugget. He was a great horse —m
size. Frisky as a monkey, an’ could gallop like a
racer—if you wanted to yard him. Hidin’ him—
he was too slow for a funeral. He always had his
eye on me, though, an’ if he saw I wasn’t watchin’
he’d jump two ways at once. If that shifted me
—it mostly did—he’d down with his head an’ give
three sudden bucks. No occasion to give inore’n
three. . By that time I’d have my second seat,
an be spi'tin’ out teeth ail’ dirt an’ grass. I once
aca illar in two, spearin’ down on him
fiud le 1 ke. I had a great respect for Nugget in
them days.
‘‘Travellin’ from Nanango to Tenterfield put a
set on him. Terribly dry it was, with not as much
grass as would keep a billy-goat. Chuck a log on
that fire, mate, Gettin’ a bit chilly.
Well, Nugget got that blamed poor that he
had to stand broadside to the sun to make a
shadder. Then he’d try to get in it, an’ when he
lost it by turnin’ end-on, he’d whinny for it. He
was a bit shook-up in his intellect. An’ his head
it looked the size of a house, with a lip on the
endofitthat’dtrip a bullock-waggon. Worse’n
a « j d £°t a sore back, an’ swelled wither, an’
Puffed, legs, an’ tender feet, an’ was girth-galled
both sides. I useter have him padded, too, fit to
break him down. Tried all sorts of remedies—
from axle-grease to Stockholm tar ; but I couldn’t
effect a cure nohow. An’ darn me if I wasn’t
travellm’ as a vet'in’ry surgeon at this time, too !
‘I never went through a town without a dread
of bein’ had up. As for Nugget, he’d sidle into
every house. If a woman came out he’d whinny
at her, an’ stand. I’d ask the way to the baker’s.
If I sat there talking,- Nugget would look round
mournfully, an’ I’d fancy he was sayin’, ‘Why
j:' ie don’t you get off!’ He’d smell my boots,
fust one an’ then the other ; an’ by-’n’-bye he’d
cop one m his mouth an’ try to pull it out of the
stirrup. I’d start him again, an’ he’d sidle across
wi 10 n< i place. I’d ask for the butcher’s-shop.
When I’d asked for every blessed place in the
town, I’d get off an’ drag him out of it. I was
ashamed o’ that moke if ever a man was.
He seemed to do things a-purpose. When no one
could see him he’d go fusrate. Soon’s a cove
come along he’d slow down to a crawl. Never
met a horseman wot hadn’t to crawl round
IS ugget. Everyone would say, ‘ Yer nag looks
poor.’ Looks poor ! ’Struth, they uster have
me fairly jumpin’.
“Then We come into flat, swampy country—
plenty of green feed. I gave him a spell there—
an he got the scours. That left him so weak that
he staggered when I put the saddle on him. I led
wi* r a al1 ’ carried the pack meself.
v\ hen we got to dry country again, the clods an’
stones bruised,his feet till he couldn’t scarcely
walk. The swamps had softened ’em, an’ he
limped an’ grunted something awful. I’d nave
left him long ago only for the saddle. That was
worth a pound. I uster envy the tramps—walkin’
calmly by with bluey up. Seemed like Heaven
to have no worry about grass an’ knocked-up
horses. Take my tip for it. With a pair o’ big
feet like mine an’ your’n, a man can get along
surprisin’ well without the cuddy. Gorany tea
m that billy ?
One day I was ridin’ up to a house for bread.
JN ugget was goin’splendid. He must’ve thought
it was home, seein’ ladies outside. I’d got pretty
close up when—down goes Nugget. Turned me a
turtle spank among the petticoats 1 An’ how they
did yell ! ‘Oh dear, I hope lie’s not hurt ! ’ says
??> e ’ ' l°°k at that poor horse ! ’ says another.
Poor, poor thing ! ’ An’ everybody looked at
JN ugget. His legs was spread out, his head down,
an' his bottom lip hangin’ a yard. I asked the
way to So-and-so’s. Then I hauled Nugget round,
pulled him down the road, an’ let him go for
another spell. After you with that there fire-
stick.
“1 uster notice flasn biokes wavin’ han’kerchiefs
to girls as they went along. Seemed fine fun to
me, an’ I reckoned I’d have a joke, too. I hadn’t
as muoh sense then as a respectable man oughter
have. There was a house half-a-inile off, an’ a
girl at the door. Just the thing! I hauled out
a sweat-rag an’ waved it. She waved back, then
run inside. Presently she comes out again, with
the old woman—puttin’ on her specs.—the old
man, three more girls, an’ Loramighty knows how
many kids. I felt soared, but was jest liftin’ the
sweat-rag for another shake when—down went
Nugget! Dash his old hide, but lie shot me
summersettin’ through the dust like a tumblin’
Tommy. Dunno how they took it. Didn’t look.
Slipped on in a hurry, and stared straight ahead
for hours. Damn me ! but that did make me feel
small.
Ihe last station we passed, me an’ Nugget,
was Ellangowan. Was close to the Condamine
then. There was a hut on the bank, so I reckoned
on havin’ a week’s spell—ketchin’ cod, I fastened
the reins to the stirrup-iron, so’s he’d dodder
along in front.
“ Hell yer wot a cantankerous cuss he was ! He
actually tried to bolt with the pack ! He did get
away—into a swamp. He’s there yet. Bog! It’d
bog a duck. In two minutes all yer could see was
his head an’ the top of the pack. I got that out.
The poor brute whinnied to me, too. Thought he
was bein’ let go. But it warn’t no use. His
bones is there still not a rifle-shot from Ellan-
gowan. I’ve stuck hard and fast to Biuoher since,
and travelled strickly per boot. There’s nothing
to lick it in the dry country.”
EDWARD S. SORENSON.
Sterling Merton, the valuable crank who
had “Plant Trees ” printed on his notepaper and
who instituted Arbor Days in the U.S., died
lately. Grover Cleveland made him chief of his
Agricultural Dept., and there he worked his
beneficent fad as few men had the chance.
The poorest soil in Maoriland is found in
Canterbury. The Plains are frightfully stony;
there are more shells than loam scattered along
their shingly terraces, and it is only in spots that
the ground is good for either man or beast—com
pared, that is, with the rich soils of further north
and'south. It really grows stones. Writer has
seen a man pick his land clean of boulders, pile
them along the road side, and next year, without
any ploughing or disturbance, a fresh lot of
rocks and boulders has come from—Heaven
knows where. At present Christchurch is a
considerable manufacturing town, if it isn’t the
manufacturing centre of the islands, but again it
is handicapped by having no coal worth speaking
of, and its fuel has to be brought from the West
Coast round the north end of the island. When
the Midland railway is completed it will make
little difference; the haulage through and
over the Southern Alps will keep up the
price. Yet Canterbury industries struggle along
on the old coal basis, heedless of the source of
cheap and inexhaustible power that roars down
from a hundred solid glaciers far up among the
Alps, through great shingle cliffs, dotted over with
cabbage-trees, down to where the surf thunders
on the bow of the Ninety-Mile Beach. All the
rivers of Canterbury are swift-flowing, and they
never go dry, though in a cold, dry winter, when
there is little sun to melt the glaciers, they get
very low for a few weeks. Why Canterbury
struggles along, paying through the nose for its
coal supply, when Nature has placed the-means of
obtaining a cheap and inexhaustible supply of
electric power every few miles is a mystery. A
province with a big, swift river about every 10
miles of its length should be simply dotted over
with factories worked by electricity.

m i
if
Mrs. John Evans, of Subiaoo,
West Australia, sends this pho-
tograph of herself and children,
and says:
“ Whenever any member of
my family becomes pale, weak,
debilitated, or suffers from im-
pure blood, I always fall back on
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla and Ayer’s
Pills. I give the Pills to keep
the bowels all right and the
Sarsaparilla to make the blood
pure and strengthen the nerves.
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla carried my
husband through a bad attack
of influenza, and later it also
cured him of rheumatism. I
have often given it to my chil-
dren when they have lost their
appetite and become listless. I
practise as a nurse, and fre-
quently recommend Ayer’s Sarsaparilla for the very trying-climate of this country.
And I can truthfully say that both nurse and patient are always greatly pleased.’
“The World’s Greatest Family Medicine.”
This testimonial should convince every one who reads it of the great value
of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla as a blood-purifier and general tonic. Mrs. Evans
speaks as a mother, ever watchful over the health of those most dear to her.
She also speaks as a professional nurse, one who knows just what effect these
medicines have on those who are suffering.
Be sure you get Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. There are a great many substitute
Sarsaparillas on the market that will disappoint you. Avoid imitations.
