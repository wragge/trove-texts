Threshing for Truth.
OtJB attempt, a few weeks back, to convey
to our readers some idea of the raison d'etre
of Socialism, as explained by Knglish
Socialist writers, has, we are glad to find,
excited an intelligent interest. We have re-
ceived a good deal of correspondence on the
subject—some desiring information respect-
ing details,and some criticising the Socialists’
propositions. It is a matter for regret that
we are not able to elucidate all the points
referred to us. But, fortunately, we dis-
claimed at the outset any competent or ex-
haustive knowledge of the subject, and pro-
fessed to do no more than supply a digest of
our own haphazard studies. There seems
now a general assent on the part of unpre-
judiced persons to the proposition that the
existing structure of society is not only not
the best possible, but intolerably and
perniciously faulty. But the question
whether the Socialists’ proposals of a
remedy ai’e worthy of adoption, opens
up quite different and very debateable
ground. The matter is one which de-
mands matured consideration and frank
study. Only those who obstinately answer
to the description “ears have they and will
not hear,” will decline such research. As a
general rule, theories and systems which are
new embody much that is erroneous and
false. The first locomotive engine wasn’t so
very much preferable to a team of horses ;
aud an engineer of to-day would un-
doubtedly endorse much that was said
against it by the most bigoted objectors of
the day of its inauguration. He would re-
cognise that it was, as they alleged, and as
the inventor denied, dangerous alike to
those who undertook to run it aud to
those who were invited to trust to it
as a means of conveyance. So with new
systems. They- may be in many respects
fairly chargeable with the faults and perils
which are by adverse critics attributed
to them, and still be, like the first locomo-
tive, fraught with principles which, after
correction and adaptation, in lieu of mere
denunciation, will confer unspeakable bene-
fits upon the human race. What is required
in the one case is, perhaps, what has been
proved requisite in theother. That is to say,
thatopposing and hostile interests should be
combatted and vanquished until, instead of
nearly all the learning and intelligence of an
age being employed in picking faults with a
view to prove the impracticability of the
system, these influences should be brought
to bear in good faith and earnest endeavour
on the task of eliminating faults, suggesting
improvements, and perfecting the principles
and the system for the use of mankind.
* * *
Thus, even if the main principles professed
by Socialists be correct, it is very likely that
the fashion in which they are put together
is crude, inharmonious, faulty, and, possibly,
dangerous, instead of serviceable; and, in-
Vdrsely, demonstration that there are im-
perfections and dangers in the system, is not
necessarily proof that the principles upon
which the system is based are unsound in
themselves, 'there is, probably, no country
on the face of the earth where the principles
o! Socialism can be discussed to better ad
vantage and under circumstances more
avourable to imparliality aud abstract
judgment than our own. Australia is in
the stage of development referred to by
Georg a as affording the best opportunitie
for individuals to reap the benefit of their
own exertions. A vast proportion of the
soil is still nationalised, or, rather, not mon-
opolised—yet. The tendency of wages to
starvation point, although observable, is
not scandalous. It is true that the
system of wholesale alienation already
commences 1o operate in accordance
with George’s theories, by concentrating
population in the large cities. Every father
in Australia knows and feels how hopeless it
is to look to the country for openings for
his boys. And it is notorious—scandalously
notorious that homestead settlement,
known to us as free selection, is p rpetually
being swallow»d up by aggregation of big
estates, almost, it not quite, as rapidly as
succeeding batch, s of selections are dis-
posed of, ostensibly to hona fide small
holders. But there is still access to the soil
to an extent entirely unknown in older
countries. And the blessings of fresh air and
country hamlet-life are still obtainable by
a large proportion of the population. In
consequence of this, there is here neither the
actual penury and wretchedness, nor the ac-
companying hopelessness and desperation,
which oppress and exasperate the minds of
the masses in countries such as England,
where the entire area of the territory is
monopolised. A suffering people cannot
reason coolly. Our people are not yet
suffering, and they consequently can take a
dispassionate view of the whole case, if it
interests them sufficiently.
• • •
This fortunate condition is not only true
in theory. We have tangible evidence that
it is true in fact. The tenour of the corres-
pondence which our articles have evoked,
may be adduced in evidence. From that
correspondence we select a couple of repre-
sentative letters Tor publication, as illustra-
tive of the intelligent and collected style in
which <he Australian turns the matter over
in his mind. Oue writer is a physician, the
other describes himself as being “engaged
in business.” It will be seen that both have
fixed upon the same passage for critism. The
physician thus writes: —
“These Socialists— Hyndman, Morkis, &o.— are
completely at f <ult, and doing: a great injustice to
Henry George. The latter explains in ‘Social
Problems’ that new inventions, by releasing so
many hands from the production of the by-
products, allowed them to increase'the production
of food staples (the produce of the land), provided
the raw material (land) was not all monopolised.
The logic of the text is unimpeachable, provided it
is taken for granted that weavers could not possi-
bly do anything but weave. The ability in man-
kind to make new inventions, one would suppose,
would indicate enough savez to allow them to turn
their hands to anything: and, on the face of it, it
seems absurd to suppose that labour-saving ma-
chines should be also labour-crippling— allowing
the few to gain unlimited advantage over the many
(a tide of advantage that, under healthy couditlons
as to the supply of labour, would as quickly ebb as
tlow). 1 briefly state that these Socialists may
have rushed off on one of George’s side question g
(The Functions of Government), and made it their
main point. Became the Governments aresuccess-
ful with Postal affairs and Railways, it does not
follow that they could manage Coffee Palaces and
Matrimonial fixings. There is no tendency, as far
as I can see, towards monopolies in the victualling
trades, or for a handful of men to monopolise all
the women. The case is different with railways
and there ia a great tendency towards monopoly
in many other things; but, of all the iniquitous
mown oly drifts, that of the land is the worst-for
it makes monopoly of inventions, and many other
monopolies, possible. Ex. yr.: Does in not naturally
follow that the man who controls the land controls
the cotton crop, and in turn the new-power looms
—so that not only may the weaver not dig, but,
even if be had the capital, he could not own and
use the best of looms without his cotton ? 44 What
is Socialism?” One might as well ask, what is
Science? Science is exact knowledge, and viee
verm; but how much of exactness and how much
of science ? Are not some sciences more exact,
more scientific, than others ? What is Socialism ?
It is, in a sense, the antithesis of, and it is the only
cure for, monopoly. That which has created the
monopoly drift— the advance of civilization—makes
Socialism possible. In fact, Socialism is a higher
form of Monopoly—State monopoly—and is even
at work now; more so in N S.W., where we have
Government railways, manhood suffrage, and an
enormous education vote, than in England or Ame*
rica. OEORaElsnotsooriglnalashescemstobe: he
di’aws very largely on Mill and Spencer. The
latter showed a striking analogy between the
animal body and the body politic, and George
1 merely follows this up when he says (‘ Social Pro-
blems’) that the advance from the savage to the
civilised state is like the development from the
jelly fish to the mammal. You may cut thealmost
homogenous jelly-fish to pieces, and each part will
live : in the analagous state of society, monopoly
would have no raison d’Hre. Now for your last
leader (6th September, 1884): The division made
by these Socialists of property into personal and
common property in the very extreme of Social-
ism, and is not possible in the presentstage of civi-
lization, if at all. Next: 'We have seen that
honest exchange signifies the exchange of one
commodity, which has cost a certain amount of
labour to produce, for any other commodity
which embodies the exertion of a like amount of
labour.’ This is Communism run mad. Genius,
not reaping the advantages natural to it, would
die, because it is on these advantages it exists, and
by these that it was brought forth. What is
genius, and why should the labour of one man be
considered equal to the labour of many others ?
Genius is simply the talents of many rolled into
one; it is not a something out of nothing, but it is
rather quality taking the place of quantity, and it
is acquired even more slowly than the knowledge
of the dunce, because it is acquired through the
labour of back generations (heredity) as well as
present (centralization?) If this were not so, it
would not necessarily be true that 4 practice
makes perfect,’ since the greater the genius the
less practice required. At the same time, it is
clear that difficulties arise on the decision of whar,
is the equitable ’reward of genius’ in contradistinc-
tion to monopoly. Now, turning from the spiri-
tualistic side of the question, i.e. Christian Social-
ism, I am more at one: but yet, to say 44 it
is easier for a camel to pass through Ihe
eye of a needle,” etc., should be taken figur-
atively, not literally, or even so far approach-
ing th*a latter as to altogether condemn riches.
’Now for the remedy.’ Communism, if thorough j
is certainly a rough remedy—such like as cutting
off the head to cure the toothache would be. It
would produce, homogeneity in place of unity in
diversity: a healthy organism, but one lower in
the scale—a jelly-fish. 4 A pretty state of matters
this would be . . . ; all great and noble work is
deemed impossible, save through hope of money
reward.’ But money is merely the power of ex-
change, or Liberty in a handy form, and Liberty
or Freedom (money) is a prerogative of the higher
form#. Money is not the root of evil except when
wrongly acquired, and it is so then only because it
is necessarily in evil hands. Great wealth has
hitherto, of necessity, been wrongly acquired :
hence the comparison of rich man with the camel
and needle, etc. The lust of gain did not urge on
Shakespeare; but perhaps it did his parent, or
other sources of his genius. 4 But this is conflsca
tion. Far from it—it is retribution.’ Yes, in a
sense; but 4 give a thing (or allow) and take a thing
is the d(evil’s) gold ring.’ You will now see the
estimate I hold of these Socialists beside Henry
George. I will now glance at a sub-leader of the
S.M. Herald of sth September, 1884, in which the
absolute is compared with the relative in a style
worthy’offyour contemporary. ’Protection has
endured in the United States not by reason of its
inherent soundness and strength, but because the
development of its natural consequences [absolute
has been checked by Free-trade between the States
of Lthe Union [relative].’ Gracious! What does
Protection mean, unless there is something to be
protected against ? And a house divided again s
itself cannot stand.”

object to be thus criticised; partly because
Ihe critic is discriminating respecting theo-
ries which we merely attempted to state
without endorsing them, for the very pur-
pose of inducing Investigation, and partly
because we do not jrretend to have a mono-
poly of wisdom or knowlego. We are con-
scious, indeed, that we have but feebly
stated the case of the Socialists, and thus
have, in some respects, exposed their prin-
ciples to unmerited strictures. Thus, in the
illustration of the weavers, the Socialistic
writers had preceded that part of their ar-
gument by a demonstration that what was
true of weavers was equally true of all other
occupations. They had nothing to turn
their hand to, and the writers had suggested
that even were access to land available, by
the soil being nationalised, as advocated by
George, there would be hardship, because
husbandry itself is an art not to be acquired
at a moment’s notice. But we think it likely
our correspondent has hit a blot, and that
the hardship would be incidental, and not
essential. Next, we venture to join issue
on the point relative to the tendency to
monopolies in the victualling trades We
think we can discern a tendency to mono-
poly in all trades. The creation of large
establishments, run by wealthy individuals*
either singly or in syndicates, and the ten-
dency of such vast emporiums or establish-
ments to crush out smaller traders, is said to
be noticeable in all great centres of popula-
tion, and may be observed even in Sydney-
The term, “State monopoly,” appears to
ns an anomaly. The State represents (he
community. A monopoly by the commun-
ity strikes us as a contradiction of terms.
The originality of George does not concern
us. It is the accuracy, not the novelty, of
his theories which is the essential point. If
he borrowed from Milo (whom he contra-
dicts expressly with regard to the Mal_
thusian drift of some of Mile’s theo-
risings) so much the better. Mill is a
notable authority. We cannot quite fol-
low our correspondent In his hints of a
theory relative to heredity in relation to
genius. We cannot comprehend how lust
of gain on the part of parents or progenitors
could bo conceived to take the form of
jihilosophical genius in a descendant, as in
the alleged instance of Shakespeare. How-
ever, there may be suggestions for others
where we fail to perceive them. The letter
is written in a candid and thoughtful vein,
and cannot but be productive of benefit to
other thinkers,
• • •
Our other correspondent also takes up the
cudgels fori Henry George, as against the
Socialist writers. He writes
“ Having read your recent articles on Socialism
Very carefully, and with great pleasure, I still
think that Oeouge is right, and that it is only
necessary to make land common property, or con-
fiscate rent, which will have the same effect. I
quite understand that I must not judge Socialism
by the (necessarily short exposition given of it;
but, taking the point given of the spinning-loom,
where one man does the work of ten and the nine
are starved out, I think that this argument only
holds good when we consider the nine unfit for
other employment. Imagine the great Held that
woujd be open to them if they had free access to
land; and, as you say, * cheapness begets demand,’
each machine would require a number of cotton-
growers to supply it witb|materiai—here would be
work for them at once. I remember some four-
teen years ago—the railway was just finished to
Ooulburn—a carrier said to me, ‘this thing is
played out; the railways are ruining the c juntry.’
I said, ‘No; you will only have to push farther
back, or go at something else;!you are not bound
to be a carrier all your life ;• you have two hands*
and you are just as well adapted for other occupa-
tions as you are for carrying; work with the rail-
ways, and they will assist you.’ So it is with the nine
men thrown out of employment by the cotton
mill: if land was open to them they could goat
something else. Yes, sir, we need not go beyond
George: he is a wonder. I have every sympathy
with the Socialists. They are working lor the
good of the human race; but I don’t think they
attach sufficient importance to the nationalisation
of land. They go for it, but they go for something
beyond what I think is necessary. George says
‘ that businesses which are, in their nature mon-
opolies, are properly part of the functions of the
Stale, and should be assumed by the State.’ I
don’t think the State should go further. If land
was open to all, wages would not tend to tho star-
vation point. I might be prejudiced—not that I
have any objection or dislike to the Socialists, God
forbid—but I am so taken with George that I
may close my eyes to others just as good and well-
meaning. Most likely lam Ignorant on tho subject
of Socialism. I need hardly tell you that I have
read ‘ Progress and Poverty ’ and ‘ Social Pro-
blems ’ very carefully, and I found all my own
ideas explained, and legions of ideas that never
occurred to me put in the most attractive and
forcible form. 1 carry ‘ Progress and Poverty ’
about with me, and whereever 1 see a thinking
man I give him a copy. I have already bought
fifteen copies, and will cofitinue giving them away
so long as I can afford to buy them or find a man
with brains willing to take a copy. I have given
up subscribing to churches, and will, in future, do
good in this way.”
• • *
We do not think we are called upon to com-
ment at all upon this correspondent’s letter.
As to his modest apprehension that he may
he ignorant of Socialism, we believe it is
justified. There has been hitherto no op-
portunity of learning anything about that
system of politics, and we equally confess
to ignorance. But the system is so impor-
tant, whether it be right or wrong—it is so
evidently destined to influence the imme-
diate future of the nations, and has obtained
so powerful and so wide a hold upon the
convictions of the masses throughout the
whole world—that every sensible man must
recognise the necessity of studying it, and
of acquiring such information regarding it
as shall enable him to form a competent
opinion, and to take his course with respect
to it. In order to form a just opinion, the
study must be seriously undertaken, and in
a fair spirit. That is to say, a man who is
honest to himself will guard against per-
mitting his mind to be biased by prejudices
and preconceptions created by sneers, repre-
sentations, and denunciations vented by par-
tizans evidently full of rancour and hostility.
Sagacious and reasonable men will reserve
themselves until they have had equal oppor-
tunity of hearing both sides. We write for
such men, and it has been with the view of
affording them some glimpse of a side of the
subject which our contemporaries have
sedulously studied to withhold, that we
gave, in a poor enough fashion and quile in-
adequately, a sketchy outline of what we
learned from a rapid perusal of one or two
works in which the English Socialists state
their case. There is, as we remarked at the
time, a very considerable literature dealing
with the subjejt, which, now that its im-
portance and the real earnestness and
seriousness of its professors have been de-
monstrated to Australian readers, will
doubtless be drawn upon by the thoughtful.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Their Beloved Sovereign.
The strenuous efforts which have been made by
Reuter’s people in London to put the best face
possible upon the attitude of the people of War-
saw, In respect of their visit from the Czar of Russia
have been somewhat interesting. It has been a
struggle against facts. Here are a few consecutive
cablegrams, illustrating the manner in which ac-
tual* occurrences have defied the determination of
the message compilers to make it appear as though
the Czar were a welcome visitor to the city of
Kosciusko, the capital of that unhappy Poland
which has—gagged and throttled though she has
been ever since her violation—never ceased to
throb with hatred of her Inhuman ravishers;—
“ St. Petersburgh, Sept. 3.—The Emperor Alex-
ander of Russia left at midnight yesterday for
Warsaw, where preparations have been making
for some time past for his reception.”
Preparations for His Majesty’s reception I What
visions of decorated houses, streets spanned with
arches and blazoned with “Welcomes,” does this
evoke! No hint here of the fact published in a
London paper on July 26th, that—
“ The projected visit of the Czar to the capital of
Poland has been preceded by the discovery of an
extensive plot, in which many high officials arc re-
ported to be implicated. There is no evidence
that it was directed against the person of the
Czar, but, as a precautionary measure, thirteen
thousand picked troops are to be stationed in TVar-
saw during his stay there. The number of persons
said to have been arrested shows the plot to have
been widespread. The opportunitv it affords to
the reactionary party, however, has been taken
advantage of, and a stateof siege, which, consider-
ing the normal condition of Russian administra-
tions, appears somewhat superfluous, has been
proclaimed .”
On September sth,however, a hlntof thecbaracter
of the prepar itions is allowed to reach us. Thus—
“ Warsaw, September's.—Very rigorous precau-
tions are being taken by the authorities here to
ensure the safety of the Czar, who is now en route
from at. Petersburg.”
This applies to the Journey, however. The loving
Muscovites may desire to kill their benefactor—
their saviour, who sends so many of them to
Siberia and to rot in dungeons—but the gratefu)
Poles will hail him in their capital. And so it ap-
pears:—
“ Warsaw, September B.—The Czar of Russia
was warmly received by the populace when pass-
ing through the streets of the city to-day on his
way from the railway station.”
Warmly received!] By the populace! No word of
the 13,000 picked troops. This tallies with the en-
thusiastic cheers of the immense crowd which
lined the streets at Moscow when His Majesty was
proceeding to the Kremlin for coronation. It
transpired later that the immense crowd which
cheered on that occasion was constituted chiefly
of 40,000 picked troops in plain clothes, supple-
mented by vast numbers of police and spies from
every part of the empire, while all the windows
and houses which commanded a view of the pro-
cession were similarly occupied, and the devoted
populace was for the most part dragooned out of
sight and hearing. But there was nothing of this
kind at Warsaw. How could there be among
Poles, who had enjoyed so much the beneficence
of the Romanoffs? Naturally this follows:
“ Warsaw, September 9 —The Czar and Czarina
of Russia drove to-day in an open carriage and
without escort through the princ'pal streets of
Warsaw. Ihelr Majesties were everywhere well
received.”
But then the irresistible truth breaks through.
The preparatory arrests, the 13,000 picked troops
and the state of siege, had not been adequate to
work up the popular enthusiasm to the high level
of being content to let matters slide without risk-
ing their lives in order to deprive their beloved
sovereign of his. Bursting through all the hum.
bug of flunkeyish news-purveyors, came the ugly
fact thus:—
“ London, September 11.—About lOOOpsrsons have
been arrested by the authorities in Warsaw on
suspicion of having been concerned in plots against
the life of the Czar of Russia, who is now on a visit
to that city.”
This throws a fresh light on the warm reception
accorded, If. the cablegram of September Bth be
credited, to His Majesty. It seems unlikely that
the Czar of Russia, tyrant, oppressor, and mur-
derer of so many of his subjects, will ever in his
life be accorded by those subjects any warm recep-
tion, except it is being one day received by them
with a brisk fire—of musketry.
Tawhiao and Victoria.
Kino Tawhiao has not yet seer the Queen, We
don’t suppose he is very likely to. He catted at
W indsor Castle a little while ago, while the Queen
was there, but she didn’t send for him, as she
might easily have done. Tawhiao himself isn’t a
warrior, but ho la the Royal representative of a
race of men ten thousand times more noble than
the House of Hanover. The poor devil of a King’,
wilh Te Wheoro and a few others, wandered
round the castle grounds for an hour or two, and
when he departed he left for Her Majesty a pre-
sent—a Maori mat. It didn’t strike his unsophis-
ticated intellect that the Queen of England had
already wiped her feet on, and used as a mat, the
brave and splendid race of men which is now
dwindling away in the beautiful land of the
moa. Tawhiao went to Woolwich arsenal, where
he was shown a lot of things and was asked to fire
the machine gun. Did he, we wonder, think sadly
of the times when “glorious victories” were
gained by British soldiers, armed with all the ap-
pliances of modern warfare, over Maories who
fought for their homes and wives and children
with arms taken from the British dead—when the
resolute Maori, crouched in the rifle-pit, or stood
behind the woodwork of the pah, ramming into
his old fusil pebbles from the river-beds because
he had no lead for bullets, or sticking on to a ritie-
nipple a wax-match-hoad taken from the poc-
kets and a brass-eylet cat from the boots of a
deceased Tommy Atkins to serve as a percus-
sion-cap? Cetewayo was “received kindly” in
England, so people think. The Queen conde-
scended to see him; but, in reality, the Zulu chief-
tain who had annihilated a regiment at Isandl-
wahna served merely as one of the objects of a
petty and hollow modern “ triumph,” after the
fashion of the Roman (Lesars. Tawhiao, the
representative of a nation of Abd-el-Kaders, has
been treated memly in England by the ignoble
odicials of a pettifogging court. No wonder that
a French writer has pointed scornfully, not at the
lion-hearted John Bulb who thrashed his legions
out of the Peninsula and fought by their side
against the Russians, but at the spurious John
Buuii, the Exeter-Hall-miesionary-trader John
Bum., who “caused the Imperial eagle to perish
in the cage at Bt. Helena, by pulling out its
feathers, one by one, through the bars; and
who, after Sebastopol, stirred up the Druses
against the Syrian Christians.” Her Gracious
Majesty distributes “honours” pretty freely
amongst all sorts of lickspittles and toadies, in-
cluding a big crop from the Australasias. She
might have shown a little attention to the King
and ambassador of the Maori race. And if she
doesn’t know or remember who and what the
Maories are, and have been, it is a great pity that
the well-greased flunkeys,| who surround her have
either been equally ignorant or have been allowed
by the nation to spit on the man, now monarch
but In name of th'? warriors who filled the rifle-
pits at Rangariri.

ing it hot to the rabbis of old time, the while com-
placently ignoring the fact that there is no whit

The termination ot Mr. Henry George’s
mission in Great Britain, and Its result in a finan-
cial deficit after expenses had been paid, evoked a
tong series of sneers and scoffs from the non-
progressive Press-that is to say, all the leading
dailies. It was natural that the organs of wealth
should regard that as a failure which had not been
productive of money profit. According to theiir
system of thought, everything is measurable by
money value. Barnum would be a distinguished
success and worthy of proportionate respect,
were he to run his exhibition throughout
England and nett £50,000. Adelina Patti can
earn £500 a night. Henry George had a deficit
of a couple of hundred pounds. It was not con-
sidered. ot course, that Henry George didn't
reckon on making money, and that, as his lectures
could only please, as a rule, the people who have
not sovereigns to spend for seats in the stalls or
lump sums of £500 to pay for a box for the season
a monetary success on his part would only
have indicated one of two thiugs, viz., either
that he had such poor reasoning that the proper-
tied classes had paid to attend and laugh at him, or
that he had turned traitor to himself and lectured
so as to suit their pleasure. However, the organs
of property sneered and flung the word failure
after him, because, although every lecture he gave
had been attended by a thronged audience, and
had elicited the most tremendous applause, no
considerable number of persons of fashion, wealth,
or social standing had deigned to take notice of
him, except to denounce him. But the satisfaction
of sneering without areal triumph is wearing out
and even the bitterest of George’s critics are com-
mencing to whimper their real opinions. Thus
for example, we find the Hon. George C. Bro-
derick, in the course of an article on Democracy
and Socialism—a comfortable article, which aims
at showing that Democrats will not be so
very cruel as to progress to Socialism — con-
fesses that “it would be a grave error to mea-
sure the advance of Socialistic opinion in Eng-
land by the feebleness of its public demon-
strations. If English working men have only
coquetted with the International, and other revo-
lutionary leagues which have risen from its ashes,
it is to be feared thatrast numbers of them have
lent a ready ear to Mr. Henry George's project for I
confiscating the soil of the country without com-
pensation.” 1


Vnw this was something like a revival i
meeting, and it eventuated way over at the\ery
opropriately-named Hot Springs, Arkansas. It
onnears that Mr. Leon Dishowan and Pete Lewis
had a little misunderstanding over the right
Maimed by both to escort Amy Pidcock, the minis-
?nr's daughter, home after church. Pete was the
man who first selected the gentle Amy after
survey, and the loving pair joggled along smooth
enough until Leon burst upon the Springs in all
the gorgeous refulgence of a white-frilled shirt,
diamond studs, and patent-leather boots. While
old Pidco.-k was knocking the stuffing out of
however, it was pointed out that the ammunition
was all used up, and it was then arranged that the
rivals should plug each other, Ala slogger Sullivan,
in the adjoining churchyard, while the parson sent
home for more powder and bullets. Amy how-
ever, in a moment s private confab with Leon,
quietly, but firmly, placed a derringer in his boot-
A moment later, Mr. Lewis was stretched on
the floor, dead, while the live pair of lovers were
hugging each other in the sanctuary, and old

otthe fanlight by the sag of his breeches, and
bitterly lamenting the loss twenty
minutes duelling. Little pleasantries like this
ham’s office, the other day, for a little talk, we put
on a collar and a tommy and went up, too. We
didn’t know at the time what the little talk was to
be about, bat, as there were ladies in the question,
and, as a matter of course, parsons, we calculated
on trading off a bit of our standing stock of con-
gratulation. When we went in, we saw that they
were all seated, and that the object of our worship
was stealthily casting winks about the room. We
knew it was at the maps on the walls he was cast-
ing them, and we rejoiced at the return of gleefill
happiness to the worn features. “We intend,”
said the Kev. D. J. Hamer, “ with the help of God,
and you, sir, to put down seduction.” There was
at present enrolled, and more than 400 of them are
unmarried.” There was then an interval of three
minutes for promiscuous winking. The great
Graham behaved most creditably. For the first
thirty seconds Dr, Bromby did the cutting out,
but he fell behind about there, and the Eev.
Hamer made the running. When half through. It
was neck and neck between him and Graham; but
the superior stamina of the old one told, and he
lived down his plucky rival, having it all to him-
self at the finish. Time being up, Graham asked
the ladles: “Is one sex more to blame than thb
other ? Don’t you think there’s lewdness on both
sides ? This villanous question “bopped” the ladies.
Salan’s skin, a few Sundays back, Pete walked
quietly into Amy's pew, whereupon Leon, who
was there already, pulled out his shooting-iron and
opened fire, Pete, upon his part, promptly return-
ing the rather sultry compliment. Pretty soon the
bulk of the congregation was actively engaged in
dispersing through the doors and windows and fat
Deacon Skegsby, who was jammed tight in a stained
glass fanlight near the choir, received a deadly
wound in his back stomach from the “ wepun” of
Mr. Peter Lewis. When the smoke c eared,
preacher Pidcock came down from the pulpit and
observed that ns he was the father of Amy i was
his bounden duty to see the boys ‘ fit ” fair.
Much to the good old silver-haired man's disgust,
tend to make the rather too solemn Wesleyan ser-
vice nice and cheerful.
We always sympathise with the man
whom destiny obliges to live and work among un-
congenial surroundings; and if ever an occasion
comes round in which fortune changes for the
better, we instinctively extend our hand in con-
gratulation. Latterly, things have been in a very
glum way with the great Graham Berry. To be
blamed by one’s friends puils a man down consider-
ably, but to be praised by one’s enemies Is still
more belittling. And, to suffer in that way day
after day, puts water in the corner of the eye and
makes the chin hang. When, therefore, two or
three parsons brought a lot of ladles up to Gra-
a pause for a few minutes, while the Chief Secre-
tary again winked at the maps on the wall. “ We
intend,” said the Rev. Dr. Bromby, “that, with
your help, sir, and God’s, we shall put down seduc-
tion.” You would fancy the Chief Secretary’s
eyes were worked by a galvanic battery at his
poll. After a great deal of winking this time, he
said, addressing himself to the ladles, “ Are there—
ah—many women getting them—ah—at the present
time?” The ladies were puzzled, owing to the
tense in which the question was shaped, but the
Rev. Hamer helped them out of the difficulty by
stating that the question might be answered by
giving the present record of the MaternltyHospital.
Then one of the ladies said: "We have 600 patients
One of them, however got up and very honestly
said, ‘Females call it deceit on the part o I the
men, but we don’t know what the males call it.”
The Rev. Hamer was going to give an explanation
here, but the Rev. Dr.. Bromby stopped him, inti-
mating that he could do it better; and then Solici-
tor Maddook made a start to go one higher yet,
when the Chief Secretary, winking all round the
room, said he knew more clearly than any of them
what males called it, and the quicker they all went
home the better. Then the parsons drew the
ladies away amid a Kentish fire of winks, at the
conclusion of which we offered our congratula-
tions, and, returning home, laid by our collar and
tommy for the next great occasion.;

The local Upjohn of Victoria (Coburg

Shilrey Holmes, an old soldier, was lately brought

food. Holmes was one of the Light Brigade, who
made the Tamous Balaklava charge, and this pro-

Viscount Castlerosse, son of the Earl of

Victoria, is a groat draw in Melbourne. It is said,
with truth, doubtless, that he is the only aide-de-
camp who for years has not worn four-penny
socks. Lord Kenmare, his father, is not a rich
man. But, still, he has sufficient conscience to
allow "Lisle-threads” to his son and heir. We
commend this example to his Excellency who has
so benefltted the State by the cultivation of fowls.
The champion “strong man” of the day

with a water-monkey, last week.” Broke what ?
Why, Samson, armed with the jaw-bone of his
favourite ass, couldn’t do that. The only way
Michael could crumple up his man would be to
force the contents of the wafer-botfle down his

means. Will it be believed that to a woman who
recently gave birth to three twins, or rather trip-
lefs, a reduction of one pound was made from the
sum of three pounds usually sent, because one of
the children had since died ? The custom itself is
a ridiculous one, considering that the groat ques-
tion of the day is the prevention of overpopula-
tion; but while it is kept up, the Royal Bounty
should at least he distributed Rayally.

It is war to the knife between the news-
paper men of the Northern Territory and Sti-
pendiary Pater of that ilk. The Northern Aus-
tralian does “not blush to call Mr. Pater, in the
full meaning of the word, a liar.” Think of that!
TJhis unblushing statement lain reply to an insinu-
ation by Pater that the police had bribed the local
repo.ters into their service, and that the reporters
had accepted the bribe. Until this little trouble is
composed, we should strongly recommend our
Northern brethren not to get “tight, ’ as a re-
porter in bonds before Pater would stand a good
show of being sent up for the term of his natural

A noted English Xudge, long Iboked upon
as an exemplary Christian, Sir Watkin Williams,
lately died in a house of ill-fame. His “ well-
connected " friends made fearful efforts to have
the affair hushed up. Hut the coroner (Mr.
Browne, of Nottingham) pluckily refused to notice
a deliberate attempt to “square” him from a
very high quarter, and replied that he would
make just the same enquiry in the case of the
highest as he would in that of the lowest person
in his jurisdiction. There have been pitiable
moanings andgroanlngs among the London Judges
over the scandal caused by thoir learned and lasci-
vious brother.
Miss Hurst, “ the wonderful strong Yankee
woman,” who has been astounding New York by
her lifting and holding feats (performed appar-
ently as much by some kind of occult force as by
muscular strength), is described as “a big girl,
weighing about one hundred and fifty pounds.
She would weigh more if she were hard, but her
flesh is soft and flabby. She has large white hands,
with very long fingers. Her face is fluffy, the
noso well-shaped, the mouth full, and the eyes
small.” This is not very pleasant, but it is still
more disappointing to be toldjthat she looks, as if
she were afflicted with fatty degeneration of the
ankles and feet.
Six new peers are said to be about to be

brooke, Mr. Samuel Morley, Sir Arthur Hayter,
and (but this is very doubtful) Mr. W. H. Glad-
stone, the Premier’s eldest son. Mr. Gladstone is
said to be waiting for a favourable opportunity in
order to place these names among his supporters
in the Upper House; and he may even create a
larger batch. We are sorry not to see Sir Salmon
Wilson’s name in the list. Salmon is no doubt
waiting till Beaconsfleld gets into office again. Of
course, Biaconsflela’s dead, but you never can tell

” When Gerald Massey told his audience in
the Athenneum, Melbourne, that Shakespeare’s
contemporaries had no conception of his greatness,
Mortimer Franklyn I nibbed his chin and gave
both his ears to the genial lecturer. The reason-
ha! the reason—was the point the lecturer, stand-
ing on one leg, was driving his intellectual cork-
screw into. The reason why his contemporaries
failed to notice the Poet’s greatness was, accord-
ing to Mr. Massey, because Shakespeare was so
intensely human, modest, and unpretending.
Then Mortimer took back his ears, and mused:
“As It was in those days, so it is in these. Look at
me. Like cause, like effect! ”
Peterson, a Salvationist, has been fined ss.
in Albury. He tried to sell a War Cry to Mrs.
Toast, and she told him to clear, Pete then told
her she was going to hell, and knelt down to pray
for her.—
Said Pete, “ Dear Mrs. Toast, I pray
A War Cry you will buy,
Or else I fear that you will toast
In hell when you may die.”
The Magistrate, with eye severe,
That made poor Peter sob,
Said, “ Pete, my boy, pray cheaper prayers,
This costs you Just five bob.”
Disputes between one Ministerial Depart-
ment and another are, however deplorable, at
least intelligible, which is more than can be said
of ructions between branches of the same Depart-
ment. When Hansard Robinson, of the Colonial
Secretary’s boys, goes for Printer Richards, of the
Treasurer’s crowd, or vice versa, and each is backed
by his own boss, there is, of course, a difficulty in
composing the struggle; but when Whitton, of
the Works, goes for Goodchap of the same, or
Goodchap goes for Bennett, also of the identical
Department, and their boss don’t strike a peace
betwixt them sharp, it seems to us that he, the
said boss, is a weak, backboneless jellyfish, unlit
for his place.
Pop it on, gentlemen. One down; who
makes another ? Last week we had the felicity of
chronicling the death of the 749th hero who figured
in the Charge of the Six Hundred, and to-day we
learn with unspeakable joy that the 750th veteran
has turned up his toes, and is now employing his
leisure moments acting as a daisy-fertilizer in the
bone-yard of Christchurch (New Zealand). His
name was Samuel Wilson, and ho bore the rank of
sergeant-major in the Bth Hussars; but of late was
employed in the less exciting, but far more useful,
occupation of sharpening tools in the Christchurch
railway workshops. Active preparations are now
being made for the interment of the 751st member
of the same immortal corps.
Mr. Kingston, the Adelaide barrister, who
went out on the shoot one afternoon and succeeded
in “potting” a cabman, has been found guilty,
but was recommended to mercy “on account of
previous good character.” And now you’ll imagine,
possibly, that Mr. K. is at present languishing
within the four gloomy walls of a dungeon cell.
Happily, you are wrong. The larky lawyer has
been ordered to come up for sentence when called
upon, and breathes the air of freedom in the
meantime. Long may he continue to Inhale
liberty’s oxygen. A bad precedent will be estab-
lished if this gentleman gets into trouble through
winging a paltry cabman. Why, next we shall
be having a fuss made if a man strangles a parson.
Such maudlin sentimentality ought not to be en-
couraged.
Valentine Baker’s social rehabilitation is
now, thanks to the Prince of Wales, complete, and
the little incidents of a few years ago—the alleged
assault on a young lady in a railway carriage, and
the subsequent imprisonment—are now a mere
matter of history. In England, most people, it is
said, are not sorry to find that Baker, who as,
perhaps, the best British cavalry officer, is missed
from the army, has, in his Hater days, obtained
pardon for hii indiscretion; but why he should
not be treated with at least as much consideration
as the scores of publicly-connected adulterers and
adulteresses and the long list of titled blackguards
who are now basking in the bosom of the “ hupper
suckles,” it is hard to say. In the official list of the
guests invited to Marlborough House party.
Baker’s name appeared among the English officers
as “General Baker.”
At Herberton, Rbeuben H. Russell, car-
penter, committed suicide by raking a dose of car-
oollc acid on Friday morning.—
“ Oh a pistol or a knife, for I’m weary of my life,”
Sang Tom Hood, “ amid the strife
Of the world;
I don’t see what there Is in it,
So I’ll shoot myself this minute;
By a bullet, out of misery I’ll be hurled.”
Rheuben Russell said: “ The tussle
Of this life, and all the bustle
Glue the shavings of disgust around my heart;”
So he took it cool and placid,
And tossed off carbolic acid,
And drove off to where it’s quiet in an under-
taker’s cart.
This is the nice, delicate, impersonal way
in which they doit in America;— Mrs. Florence
designs nearly every one of her own d resses.
People always think she paints, but this is not so,
except to use white, which is necessary on the
stage. Her lips are naturally scarlet, and her
cheeks a pretty colour. Bh® is of a beautiful
figure, too, and isn’t She just the kindest soull
Now, Genevieve Ward is just tho opposite in most
essentials. She cares for nobody nor nothing but
herself. She prides herself upon the fact that she
wears no corsets, but she wears a broad ‘ bracing
board,’ to keep her waist down, and that is just as
j sinful, if sin it is. She is not an angel in temper,
but she can carve in marble, and, while she dresses
handsomely, she tosses her clothes around the
room with a sublime disregard of cost, to say
nothing of neatness, and while she is called cold
and heartless she is really womanly, and full of
j sympathy and charity.”
An incident. The Cottiers were doing their
weekly boom up Parramatta way the other night,
and Miss Alice Johns had wrestled with “Cornin’
i through the Rye ” in a style which took so well
that a gorgeous-looking bouquet came down on the
stage with a force of something like 7501 b. to tho
square inch. The lady smiled sweetly all round,
bobbed over to the floral tribute, and found It was
a ninepenny bunch of carrots. Just then, her
gratitude seemed to spring a leak, and hastily dart-
ing off the stage she made way for Mr. Cottier,
who advanced, carrots in hand, R.U.E., and ob-
served, “The donor should have thrown with
these carrots the sheep’s head he carries about with
him, and then the company would have been able
to enjoy a pot of soup.” Yells of applause greeted
this neat little speech, and for a time the shouts of
“soup wan—sheep’s ’ed an’ carrots two,” brought
up tender reminiscences of the “ Flying Scud ”
during tho palmy days of Zeplin.
John Arthur is the name of a highly
original sort of party who is at present under
committal at the coming Maryborough assizes for
tickling a kanaka’s vitals with a dose of slugs and
buckshot, and the following tale which is told of
him clearly proves his nerves are made out of
something stifler than Berlin wool or boiled
macaroni. One day, whilst busy shelling corn, he
happened to get a olt of husk in his eye, and there-
upon asked the next man to him to haul it out.
The next man said he couldn’t well do it, as he
had no pocket handkerchief. “ Hankercher be
jammed, ’ roared John; “ what the blaming Hazes
d’yer want a hankercher for ? Tek it out with the
pint o’ yer knife, man. Why, when I was in Cali-
forny mining, chaps ofen got bits o’ stuff plugged
inter their eyes, an’ w» alwiz took it out wid th’
pint uv our picks. Now, thin, let us see how y’d
shape as a gouger.” It is to be devoutly hoped
that a nigger, here or there, will never be allowed
to stand in the way of the liberty of such a man of
blood and iron as old Jack Arthur is.
“ The Claimant,” when interviewed on July
35, for the last time prior to his release, which
takes place on October 24, said that when he gets
out he will at once appeal to the public for assist-
ance. He expressed astonishment that the N.S.W.
law officers should have opposed the application
made in regard to the lunatic Crosswell, when it
was backed up by the so-called Cresswell’s brother
Edmund, and Charles Orton. We further read: -
“ The Claimant said he was told that on his release
proceedings would be taken against several dis-
tinguished persons, and the whole case would be
laid before the electors of Great Britain. He was
also informed that 11 members of Parliament had
sent a memorial to the Home Secretary, asking
that Arthur Orton alias Cresswell might be
brought over to England at the national expense.
Fears were entertained that the release of the
alleged lunatic was being purposely delayed until
after the Claimant’s liberation, and it was also
stated that 11,000 electors of Chelsea had signed a
memorial on behalf of the Claimant, it being also
pointed out that this was a sufficient number to
turn the election.” Booh!
Prince Napoleon (Plon-Plon) appears to
have seen his best day—not that that was ever very
brilliant. The brawling Bonaparte’s one strength
lay in his striking resemblance to the illustrious
founder of the dynasty, but even that has been
considerably discounted by a wen growing from
one of his eyes. So long as he could pose in public
as a veritable fac simile of the “ little corporal,”
Plon-Plon was regarded with a sort of sentimental
reverence by a certain small section of 1m periallsts,
and stood a thousand to one chance of being
pitched on the throne of France by a wave of
national caprice. But the wen has settled his last
hope; and as we now read that “the Prince takes
drives in a closed carriage, and avoids public
thoroughfares,” it’s pretty certain that this miser-
able reflex of the bold Corsican will soon sink into
a well-merited obscurity. Plon-Plon used to be
mighty proud of the “ marvellous resemblance.”
and never tired of referring to the un-Napoleomc
physiognomy of the late Emperor. Most people
are familiar with the capital retort made by the
latter to his cousin s scornful remark, " You have
nothing of the first Napoleon about you.” “Oh,
yes, I have,” said he; “I have his relatives about
me.”
“Why, Lord bless your soul,” said Mr.
Bucket to the “ man from Shropshire, ’ who was
dying in Mr. George’s shooting gallery, “ what
times we have had together! Haven’t I seen you
in the Fleet over and over again for contempt?
Haven’t I come into Court, twen-ty afternoons
for no other purpose than to see you pin the Chan-
cellor like a bull-dog ?” Of late years, Dickens’s
“man from Shropshire” lived again in the person
of that poor old crank, J. B. Slack, who held a
little property in South Melbourne, and who turned
up regularly every Chancery Court day over there
and nearly drove Judges and jurors mad by intro-
ducing his grievance, and demanding instant
justice. He was his own lawyer, and having
pleaded his cause and covered everybody with
mud, he would be gently removed from the Court
only to return to the charge with redoubled vigour
when the term came round once more. He used
to hang out in an old rookery at the corner of
Clarendon and Market streets, and on Thursday
last his|bedroom door was burst in, and be was
found dead in his bed with his throat eut from ear
to ear, and in bis left hand, which was stiff and
erect, was the fatal razor with which the deed was
done. Slack has taken his case to a higher Court.
How Tom is to get out of this we don’t
know. We haven’t lived in Burrowa, and wc
positively have to turn up the last corner of the
paper to find out that J. Stevenson is the printer
and publisher of the Times there. We're In a row
with the Damooaroo Times, for interfering about
things; and, therefore, we don't understand, and
feel timid. Well, this is what you’ve got to ex-
plain, Tom, to Mr. Stevenson’s subscribers We’ll
cut hjm down short. Date August 16. “ The free
selectors of the Burrowa district had much to
hope for at the time of seleeting a representative
in the person of Mr. T. M. Slattery. That gentle-
man was, at the time of his first election for the
Burrowa district, wholly in favour of the free
selectors. Burrowa was then represented as be-
nighted, neglected, and scarcely known. The re-
generator of her interests was embodied in the
person of Mr. Slattery. ‘He would like to see
every free selector coming home to his wife and
family with the deeds of his property under his
arm.’ ‘He would relieve selectors of paying in-
terest on their selections, and place them on the
lands of the colony without encumbrance.’ ” And
Mr. Stevenson’s man winds up concerning men of
your sort: “Recreant to every promise formerly
made, they cannot be trusted in the future.”

Nearly the t whole of the. Legislature are
giving Hanlan a picnic. This reminds us of the
gorgeous show of our rulers there was at Kendall's
funeral. But, we suppose, as a live ,sois a
living sculler better than a great dead bard. We
don’t ask George Merriman, Esq., M.L.A.; or Dan
O’Connor, Esq., M.L.A.; or H. M‘Quade, Esq.,
M.L. a., or any of a dozen more of these represen-
tative geniuses to give Henry Kendall a picnic,
because the offer might prove inconvenient to toe
sweetest singer the antipodes ever heard, at the
present juncture; but at least someone, all, or any
of this glittering phanlax of rulers might, at Ban-
ian s picnic, give enough out of their winnings at
tambaroora or chuck-halfpenny to pay a man
to sweep the sandwich-papers and nutshells from
off the dead bard’s grave. Let us suggest, for
instance, that H, M’Quade, Esq., M.L.A., who
entertains at the Windsor .Royal so royally, might
with advantage withhold (say) the amount it cost
him to load up one legislative numbskull monthly,
and charter a man to, at least, substitute gerani-
ums even of the commonest class for the man*
gle-wurzels which luxuriate there exceedingly-
having been sown about poor Harry’s grave by
well-meaning but misguided members of this staff,
under the impression that they were putting down
the ’choicest mignonette. Dan O’Connor should
remember, anyhow, mat (poor Henry has hardly
now anything but bis Shroud to console him.
Like the “Pinafore” crew, poor Pidding-
ton “ meant well ” when the Land Act trouble was
before the Legislative Council a few nights ago;
but, unfortunately, he “ didn’t know,” and, there-
fore, when he declared that the desire for the ac-
quisition of land and the secure possession of free-
holds was one of the distinguishing marks of a
civilised people, Mr. Dailey saw he had the mis-
guided senator over the hole, and he at once pre-
pared to pot him. “Asa matter of fact,” replied
the sarcastic little Attorney-General, “the very
opposite is the fact. Before New Zealand (to
which the hon. member has just referred) was oc-
cupied by civilised people, it was the home of in-
telligent savages, who had a high appreciation of
the value of landed property, and who had as
great a care for their title as the descendants of
Norman barons in these days of advanced civilisa-
tion. Indeed, it is alleged that the present Maori
sovereign, King Tawhlao, has had, for purposes of
greater security, his muniments of title, not sub-
ject to question or destruction, tatooed upon cer-
tain portions of his body, to which it might not
be. perhaps, proper in this Chamber more defi-
nitely to allude.” This was very neat Indeed on
the part of Mr. Dailey, and very prudent on the
part of old man Tawhiao: but, at the same time,
we sincerely trust we will never be called upon to
act as a juror on a case in which the Maori
monarch is called upon to produce the muniments
in question.
There was a mysterious coincidence in the
circumstance of Professor Mosley coming to the
conclusion from the fact of the lower Australian
mammals being oviparous that man is descended
from a reptilian form of life contemporaneously
with Prolessor Parkes coming to the conclusion
from the fact of the lower Australian electors
being ovipero'.iß (from the Parkes standpoint) that
the Stuart Administration was generated by the
action of the crimps, the blacklegs, and the thieves.
It is strange, though, that Parkes has so recently
come to his conclusion. Mosley couldn’t well have
come to his before, since he only learnt about the
oviparousness of the mammals a few days ago;
whereas Sirenry has known about the non-pro-
Parkousness of the electors this year and a-half or
more. We really think he hardly acted square to
the Scotchmen whom he touched for that million
in keeping so dark about those crimps, thieves,
and blacklegs, while he was “ doing ” North Bri-
tain. And not only was there a suppressio veri on
his part while explaining matters to Caledonia, but
a suggestio falsi, since he certainly spoke highly of
Australian manhood suffrage—pointed to himself
as the tip-top development of tne working of our
free Institutions—and (as regards crimps, black-
legs, and thieves) he never once referred to Mil-
burn Creek or Darling Harbour compensations, to
Randwick luncheons or tram-tickets, to erysipela-
tous selections, to bank dummying, or to Contrac-
tor-Ministers.
The law students of the Melbourne Uni-
versity have been falling away from grace latterly.
They doubtless think that the dead pull of the
pious section will carry the institution up the hill
of virtue. Lecturer Gregory found the door of his
class-x-oom barricaded from the outside the other-
day, and when he put his shoulder to the obstruc-
tion, and marched triumphantly over a litter of
Inverted chairs, he beheld a score of students
reciting Mr. Ceiling's “Oadj on the Passions with
E roper “aksent and geslkerlation.” He also be-
eld some caricatures of himself chalked on the
blackboard, The lecturer breathed profanely, but,
preserving external decency, dived into a corner
for the duster. When in the middle of the floor
he felt the duster was unduly bulky, and, by Black-
stone’s Commentaries, there was life in it. The
lecturer dropped the uncanny thing, and out
jumped a kitten. Thereupon the students gave
some more of Mr. Ceiling's “Gad” with proper
aksent and gestickerlatlon, and Lecturer Gregor y
vamoosed the ranche. Such is the painful legend.
Before the Professorial Board, which sat in the
Wilson Hall on the Bth, Dr. Dobson gave corrobo-
rative evidence of the depravity of these particular
alumni. The Board ordered the class to hand up
the ringleaders. The class wouldn't do it The
Board, therefore, resolved that the class be dis-
banded until the names of the offenders be given
up. That is a serious step; but the students de-
clare they will not yield to the lecturers, and the
lecturers declare that rather than submit to a
C( minuance of the old treatment they are ready
to go into the wooden-leg and glass-eye business.
One of the disadvantages of having too
much property about one’s person has been pain-
fully demonstrated in the case of Tawhaio, and
that monarch s opinion of British justice is of a
malignant type bordering on bewilderment. Be-
ing short of funds in London one night, he got
peckish for a bit of white man, but decided ou
IS IT COMING TO THIS?
IT IS A STRANGE AND DEPLORABLE FACT THAT JUVENILE DRUNKENNESS AP-
PEARS TO BE ON THE INCREASE. YESTERDAY, AT THE WATER POLICE COURT,
SEVERAL BOYS WERE CONVICTED AND FINED FOR THIS OFFENCE WHO SHOULD

waded intq the necessities of the institutiop until
chin and mouth were covered, and he had tq send
the voice..through his nose. He drove it out full
blast, however, and made the audience feel the
obligation they were under of putting something
handsome into the box. The Dean followed suit,
and Mr. F. R. Godfrey and the Rev. W. Q. Hindley
rubbed it in in game style. Then Sir George Ver-
don arose, hot and peppery. He said that the men
who would not contribute liberally to this fund
were not worthy of their Bishop or of their reli-
gion; all denominations would cry shame at them,
2nd would feel that the Bishop was wasting his
great powers by living and working among such
a people. The applause was great at this stage,
and the enthusiasm, In beads of perspiration,
worked itself down the noses of the appreciative
multitude. Then the collection was taken up and
counted. It came to £R). Of this Sir George con-
tributed £35, leaving £l5 as the sum total which,
under this extraordinary pressure, the balance of
the brilliant assemblage sacrificed. The doxology
was chanted, and everybody tried to look preter-
naturally devout.
Ifellow-aWornis, let us do a grovel as we
turn to the Illustrated SDOrtlnq and Drama-
tic News of August 2nd and read, “The other
evening at the Healtheries, a man was observed to
be hovering about the stall where the Prince of
Wales was expected.” Having a roost-robbing
look about him, the joker was carefully watched,
and “ entering into, conversation with someone
gtariding hy, he Sdld he tirid corile froill Australia,
the main object of his visit being a desire to see the
Princess.” Our Mr. Wales hearing this, thought
he’d amuse himself with the “ crank,” and accord-
ingly he had him trotted up and (as the sporting
!,nd dramatic groveller says) “ presented to the
’ritlcess, who spoke, so graciously to him that he
eparted at the grid df the shoi-c interview over-
oyed, with tears or pleasure in his eyes.” H. H.,
for a ducat! None but that distinguished littera-
teur could so successfully scheme for a bow from
Royalty, and we’d cheerfully pawn OUT Sunday

gauntries fdr him. The Healtheries incident re-
minds us of the tale told of another tuft-hunter
of ——’s calibre, who showed his idolatry for
a certain princess by seizing the finger-glass in
which she wiped her greasy tips at a State dinner,
and draining off the contents at a single gulp. And
this being told to the high-born dariie, she promptly
exclaimed, “ Mercy me 1 tell the fellow rd call
round after! have had my fdot-bath to-night, and
I’ll glvb, him something strong.” Verily, “the
ktafn of man’s bred out into baboon and mon-
key.”
The Bishop of Melbourne, it appears,
comes within the category of moderate drinkers,
like his Episcopalian brother, Barry. But you
mustn't rush madly to the conclusion that the
Right Reverend Moorhouse takes an Impious
pleasure in his port, or seeks for solace in his
sherry, as do other men. Kindly sit still one
moment, and we’ll explain to you why the Bishop
keeps a “bottle on the ohimbley piece, and puts
his Ups to it when so dispoged.” It’s for the good
of sinners—to enable him to give the old chariot
an extra push, as Major Bafker worild sky. No
other reason, we assure you. Don’t shut one eye,
ftnd remark, “Walker!” because we are merely
Stating fact. The Melbourne D.T. found out fill
about it the other day. One of the hungHest-look-
ing of the D.T. staff was put into a white choker,
and .’made-up as milch like a Curate aS possible,
and then despatched to Interview MPorhouSe dn
that thirsty subject, the “ Liquor trafilc.” During
this Interview it was that Bishop M. exnlained the
glorious use to which the grape’s juice may be
put. Said he: “I took the pledge when a young
man, and was for some years a teetotaler. It was
to me no sacrifice; but my work was very ex-
hausting, and I was told by one of the ablest
physicians of the time that I must either drink a
glass of wine to dinner or greatly diminish my
labours. I felt it right to take the wine, rather
than cripple myself in work.” Think of that, dear
friends. The Bishop has for years been pouring
the nasty occasional glass of liquor down his
throat from purely philanthropic motives. Don’t
laugh, but do likewise. If you feel that “swear-
ing-off ” cripples you in your work, why, just
heave a sigh and “ swear on ” again. We have.
The struggle against our prejudices was a hard
one, but the good cause triumphed. We hired one
of the ablest physicians to tell us that the litera-
ture of our age would benefit if we took an inci-
dental rum hot, and we take it. After you with
the sugar.
If you don't want to be sick, skip this and
oblige, because it is rather a nauseous bit. Well
(to get it over as quickly as possible), you must
understand that the Melbourne D.T., bein r a seri-
ous p per, feels, naturally enough, a rabid admira-
tion for that plump, out-and-out Christian, the
Prince of Wales, as well as for all his works. The
anxious interest taken by this royal philanthropist
in the welfare of his poorer countrymen and
countrywomen—especially actresses—is such as
almost to melt the D.T. to tears. It says: “We
commented some time ago upon the fact that the
Prince of Wales is sitting as a private member,
along with those who may form his future sub-
jects, on a Royal Commission appointed to enquire
into the housing of the poor.” (We remember
being ill for a week over those same comments;
but no matter, we are feeling comparatively
strong again, now.) Then the D.T. goes on to
quote the report of a feeble little speech made by
Prince Albert Victor (the “ Royal youth ”) on the
same plebeian subject, and sa’s: “We hail it as an
augury of the happiest kind that father and
son are as one in sentiment upon this matter,
and trust that, as both bear the honoured
and revered name of the Prince who was
known as * Albert the Good,’ they may follow in
his footsteps. It will, indeed, he an incomparable
event should so gracious and deserved a title be
maintained through three generations.” Now.
what on earth does the D.T. mean by saying that
our Gracious Sovereign Lady’s husband “ was
known as ‘Albert the Good’?” He is known as
A. the G.—in a poem, written to order, by Baron
Tennyson. In the same way, the defunct gillie
might he known as “ Brown the Blest.” And as
regards “Wales’s” likelihood of doing anything to
accomplish the “incomparable event” aforomen-
tloned—hut you’d better run outside and be sick
without loss of time. Why, we could tell you a tale
about somebody smuggling « couple of the demi-
fftOHde into the Royal carriage to and from Sandown
Park races, that would make your each particular
loyal bait to .stand om end. Bluebeard was a baby
compared with the “ coming K.’
The Melbourne ARetrg, in a “leader” on
Mr. Peter Campbell’s matrimonial experiences,
affords an illustration of the way in which certain
newspaper men will distort facts with a view to
Support fancies. Some people are wont to conceive
that a dCpatture from orthodoxy unsolders all the
goodly fellowship afflan has held with the domestic
virtues. The conception is erroneous, but its ex-
istence has to be counted on when the subject of
tergiversation from a standard religion turns up.
A writer who pretends to be informed will take
care to keep events that should be classed as Post
from being classed as Propter. This the Argus
writer has not done. And he sins by commission
more deeply than by omission. He makes the cir-
cumstances which result in the “ well-deserved
obloquy ” of the missionary spring from the mis-
sionary’s acceptance of the principles of free-
thought. He sketches Peter’s biography thus:
“ He (Campbell) was formerly a bush missionary,
but something or other hr vlng occurred to unsettle
his religious opinions, he Joined the comprehensive
rgnks of the freethinkers. It then occurred to
him that, though well on In years, he might
as well take a ticket in the lottery of
marriage.” Then succeed the items which
make up the well-desetved obloquy. Now, it was
not through the gat? of freethinking that Peter
entered i 4 nto his obloquy. Peter aVers, and so does
his wife, that he wAs a, genuine missionary when
he made love, wh6n he matriCd, and When he
made upon her the magnificent settlement of two-
pounda-ten per annum as an acquittance in full of
thp total of, his .marital responsibilities. Peter
writes unctuously at this period, telling her of the
miles of bush country he is abqut.to traverse in
the discharge of hiS.high and holy duties, and giv-
ing her to know that he leaves her behind apiong
all the bad adjectives of the language. There cap
I be no mistaking it that Peter was a man of ample
faith during that period of suffering. Wo don’t
want to make a case of any kind out of Peter.
Whether he roots hjmsejf in orthodoxy or hetero-
doxy does not concern us. But we are concerned
in doing what we canto keep a pppulgr eyror from
being pandered to by an unscrupulous \yrl,ter.
Offences of this kind do injury to the Press gener-
ally. Aninfluence caught shamelessly prostituting
Itself in so trivial an affair merits to share “the
well-deserved obloquy ” with the once orthodox
missionary.
Hang these New Zealand penny-whistle
constituencies I There is no pleasing them, any-
how. There was, for Instance, Walter Hypolite
Pllllet, Esq., whom the electors of Stanmore,
Christchurch, returned as their member three
years ago, on the Grey ticket. Well, Walter Hypo-
lite, you see, as soon as he got into the House and
saw what was which, recognised at a wink the im-
mense advantage of being on friendly terms with
the Colonial Treasurer, and he accordingly gave
the Grey party the slip, and placed his vote at the
service of Major Atkinson, who occupied that
position in the Whittaker-Atkinson administra-
tion. Bat were his constituents grateful, and did
they present him with an address and a lot of
“sufferings?” With the latter certainly, and
Elenty of them. When he tried to return, after
is labours as a political rodent were over, to the
bosom of his virtuous domestic salle-a-manger, the
unfeeling wretches actually chased him across
thirteen gorse-fenced paddock?, and he had to hide
in a suburban sewer till the “ free and indepen-
dent” of Stanmore had retired, growling future
vengeance, to their several downy couches for the
night. He has seldom, since then, appeared in
public, except in the company of a big bull-dog
presented to him by the Major, and a walking-
stick with a fearfully developed head, the gift of
an admiring Israelite, one of whose ancestors re-
ceived it in pawn from Jonah, after the latter’s
return from his trip to Nineveh, And now, once
more, when the electors of Stanmore have secured
the weighty services of big Daniel Reese, the best-
looking and honestest man in New Zealand, except
our correspondent, and Daniel votes with Sir
George and walks with him, arm in arm, nightly
along Lambton Quay, in full sight of the blazing
universe, what do these never-rest-and-be-thank-
ful constituents do, but try to vex their unruffled
representative by sending him the present of a
rat-trap, a ferret, and a gross of packets of some
stuff called “Rough on Rats.” These articles
Daniel received with a sweet and seraphic smile,
and after showing them to his friends, has had
them properly labelled with red ink and re-pre-
sented to the Christchurch Museum.
Ganeanelli laid it down that no man of
originality should receive promotion in the church.
The great Cardinal saw that a hack was better than
a blood-horse for the sort of road he had in his
eye. The rule is more applicable to-day than it
was then. It will stand among tbej?rst of ecclesi-
astical blunders if the Rev. C. M Teltand, of CoJ-
lingwood, be advanced to any high dignify. He
has originality—a most peculiar, striking, and
noteworthy kind of originality. Not more than
once er twice in a century does originality like
Yelland’s manifest Itself in the church. Take this
as the freshest sample of it. They were holding a
meeting in the Foresters’ Hall, in Collingwood, for
the purpose of carrying some resolutions in favour
Of Local Option. Rev. »elland wanted them
passed, Publican Pugh wanted them scored out.
They went at it, geographically, historically, exe-
getically, and pugilistlcally. The parson had
the best of it in the three early stages, but,
naturally enough, Pugh was the better pugi-
list. We were in the hall of jhe Y.M.0.A., in
Russel 1-street, at the time, leading the prayer
that all the sections of Christianity might yet be
brought together under the spiritual guidance of
dearly beloved Brother Marsh, who alone, in our
opinion, has the right hang of the Celestial riddle.
Therefore, we were not present at the scene in
Collingwood, and hive to rely for our facts on the
report in the daily Press. The report is, however,
we are confident, substantially accurate, for we
know the man who wrote it, and, as he is just
after doing six months in gaol for prevarication,
it is highly improbable that he would fall again so
soon. The report runs: The excitement now be-
came intense, Mr. Yelland standing at one end of
the table attempting to speak, and emphasising
every effort by stamping his foot and striking the
table with his list, while at the other end was Mr.
Pugh, shaking his flat at Mr. Yelland, and
shouting at the top of his voice, “That’s
what we call a tableau.” Then said Mr.
Yelland. “Who was it at Wolverhampton, that
advocated the pulling down of the public
houses and the suppression of drink? Why, that
man!” And he pointed at Pugh. Again: “ Who
was it crept into ray church as a verger, and turned
up his eyes in detestation of the drink traffic?
Why, that man ” And still he pointed at Pugh.
Pugh said, " Thei'e is a ffllnlSter of the church for
you! If he was a man, rwould strike him.” Pooh,
Pugh! Yelland’s gendbr is tight enough, we’ll go
bail. It is his Unfortunate bias towards originality
that is vexatious. He is cursed with the genius
Ganganelli eschewed. To point to a worshipper
who turned up bis eyes on Sundays, and compare
his deeds with his words, is a monstrous departure
from ecclesiastical routine. Why, whatever his
deeds were, the fact of the greatly man having
crept into church as a verger and turned up his
eyes at tiie fight place, merited for him a place in
the ring of the ranfiomed. Yelland s arraignment
of Pugh implies that in hi 9 reverence s opinion a
man ought not to make a profession of religion on
Sunday, whose daily life contradicted the profes-
sion. That’s what we call originality of a most
peculiar, striking, and noteworthy kind, iou may
say it is only common honesty. But, remember,
we are talking of the church. We repeat it ib
originality, most startling originality, and it should
not be forgotten when Yelland seeks ordination.
One of the most remarkable trials that has
taken place in G reat Britain tor many years is that
of Cornwall v. O’Brien, which has recently been
heard in the Nisi Prim Court, Dublin, before Mr.
Justice O’Brien and a special jury, when the
damages were laid at £5OOO, for alleged libel. The
plaintiff in this memorable action was Gustavus L.
Cornwall, secretary to the General Post Office, Dub-
lin; and the defendant, William O Brien, M.P., the
editor of the Nationalistic paper, United Ireland.
During the past decade, there were dark rumours
afloat In “dear, dirty Dublin” that abominable
and nameless crimes, such as can only be hinted at,
not mentioned among civilized men, were perpe-
trated by men moving In the upper circles, and
which the editor of United Iked and, at alt
hazards, determined to bring to light. The terrible
and utterly degrading nature of the offences ren-
dered the task of discovery and proof almost im-
possible, and will, therefore, the more readily be
understood the risk that attended the fearless
journalist who was instrumental in unmasking the
most loathsome scoundrels that ever denied this
fair earth. Cornwall, who has occupied a foremost
position in Dublin aristocratic circles, is 63 years or
age, and has spent ft years in the Government
service, having' entered the Postal department in
London as far back as 1840. In 1843 he was ap-
pointed secretary to Colonel May bury, one of the
heads of the department, and some time after he be-
came private secretary to the Earl of St. Germain s.
He was appointed to the secretaryship ot the G.r.O,
Dublin, in 1850 by the Marquis of Clanrlcarde, a
position which he has tilled since then. In 1861, he
married a sister of Sir Robert Alexander DaJzell,
of Scotland, who is still living. The other parties
who are implicated in the crimes of which Corn-
wall is accused are also persons occupying high
social positions—amongst them being an army cap-
tain and other “swells,” and the names of not a
few of the nobility are also freely mentioned.
When the web of evidence was fairly woven, the
editor of United in the issue of May 10,
1883, published an article impeaching Cornwall,
Bolton, and French-t“e latter also Government
officials— and charging them witif sseries of crimes'
of the grossest description. As may he expected,,
this article bad the desired effect, and 1 fVßrien was'
I promptly served with writs for libel, Ita which'
damages were laid at between £30,000 ann £40,000%
One of these—Bolton V O’Brien—is yet sub
the other, Cornwall r. O’Brien, has justtermin.’rted.
In both cases, defendant pleaded justification tixdl
denied that the articles were libellous, but were ihai
every instance substantially true in every particu-
lar. The best legal talent that eculd be procured in
Dublin was secured on both sides, am 1 luring the
trial, which lasted over five days, some of the most
horrible disclosures were made—disclosures which
were in the extreme shocking and revolting; so*
much bo, that the counsel for plaintiff said that he*
feared that the terrible calamity which befei the*
“Cities of the Plain” (see Genesis! would not be*
out of place In Dublin! The jury, however, after
due consideration, found a verdict for the defend-
ant in each instance, sustaining in full the pleas of
justification. As may be imagined, the edjfw of
United Ireland is the hero of the hour. Thw
verdict of the jury was received with the greatest
rejoicing; and from one end of the Green Isle U»
the other it was hailed with demonstrations of joy".-
Shortly afterwards Cornwall was arrested on the
charges Imputed to him by the United Ireland,
and several of his companions no w share his incar-
ceration. The affair, as may be imagined, has
caused the most profound sensation in Dublin,
especially in the “society” circles to which the*
accused belong. In the meantime, expressions off
gratitude are pouring in upon Mr. O’Brien from 1
all parts of the kingdom, and u movement Is n&w
on foot to raise funds to testimonialise him as weW
as to indemnify him for the expense he has in-
curred In his triumphant vindication of the cause
of morality. There’s a moral to be derived from
this case: “ It is a safer game for the plueky jour-
nalist to expose infamy in benighted (7> \reland
than in enlightened New South Waies.”

It is said that Mr. R T. W. Cave, of Bunda-
berg (Qeensland), stan d a good show of bo-
oming the next Earl of Newburgh... Master
Ernest Hutcheson, the boy-genius, whom it
is Dr. Torrance's privilege to have under bis
guidance, gave a brilliant pianoforte recital ately
in the Melbourne Athenaeum. The lad ovokedi
ravishing music from the instrument. The per-
formance comprised several compositions of his
own, and—here let us quote the programme :
“Selections from i’ieller, Chopin, Mendelssohn,

Title, Torrens' Act.
The question is now frequently asked, ‘’Where
is Queenscliff ? ”
Queenscliff comprises the whole of the line un-
dulating range across the Curl Curl Lagoon, ex-
tending from the ocean to the old Pittwater-road,
which overlooks the whole of the town of Manly
and the lower portion of Sydney Harbour.
It is difficult to Imagine any spot so well suited
for the Marine Suburb of a large city as Manly,
possessing a splendid Beaon on the shores of the
Harbour, approachable from the city by smooth
water all the way, while within less than a quarter
of a mile from the steamers’ wharf is the grand
ocean beach nearly a mile in length, fronting
which, about 150 feet back, are numerous line
houses extending the greater part of the distance.
The most charming spots in Manly for Villa
Sites are the hills to the North, and South Clifton
Heights to the South are being rapidly built over,
and it will be a difficult matter in the conrse of a
few years to secure a decent sized piece of ground.
Queenscliff bounds Manly to the North, and ex-
tends to the beautifully shelly beach of Fresh-
water, which has been dedicated tor public re-
creation.
It is within easy walking distance across the new
foot bridge of the Manly wharf, and commands
LAND and OCEAN VIEWS unequalled near
Sydney, and the villa sites are beyond all question
the finest in the neighbourhood. They vary in
depth from 150 to 460 feet, and those fronting the
Lagoon have water frontages suitable for bathing-
houses.
English estates have special values in conse-
quence of there being good shooting about, and
there should be good shooting in this locality;
there is certainly good fishing out at sea and in
Curl Curl Lagoon. Rabbits and hares may be
abundant, but the auctioneers cannot vouch for
the tact; and as for foxes, there is a whole family
at Manly, but it would be dangerous to attempt
to shoot any one of them.
This superb Estate will be sold on the ground, on

THIRTY SHILLINGS.
mr THIRTY SHILLINGS.
The Autophone!
ORIENTAL GOLD
Is tho latest discovery of Science and the grandest
achievement of the alchemist's art. It looks like
gold, it is as heavy as gold, and it la more enduring.
None but an expert can detect the difference, and
then only by the severest tests. Ornaments made
from this new composition arc equal in design and
general appearance to those made of the finest
18-carat gold, and yet we sell them at but a tithe of
the Cost of the genuine goods.
Remember that we do not pretend that Oriental
Gold is anything but a composition of pure metals*
but we do affirm that it is so perfect an imitation
of the sterling gold as to almost defy detection.
Jewellery made of It may be worn anywhere, and
the closest inspection will only strengthen the con-
viction that it is real gold. So perfect is it, and so
large has our trad s become, that jewellers through-
out the colonies are complaining of the dullness
in trade, and are constantly writing to us to secure
our goods for their own customers. But as we are
Sole Agents for these colonies, we prefer to deal
directly with the public. All of our Oriental Gold
Jewellery is made to our order, and is stamped
with our trade mark. You can order anything
from a Scarf Pin to a Watch and Chain, and it will
be sent Post Fkeb, and at our risk, on receipt of
price.
SPECIALLY OBSERVE,
Should you be dissatisfied with your Investment
after inspecting the articles, re-pack them at once
and send them back to us. If this is done within
two days—or where malls are fow, by the first post
after receipt, and the articles are not injured—we
will return the money, deducting only the trifle
expended on postage. You can keep any one
article and return the rest, and we will refund the
money for the articles not retained. Fair dealing
is our motto, and we bind ourselves to give satis-
faction. Examine our catalogue, and send in your
order for what you may require.
N.B —We find that, through an error on the part
of the manufacturers, we are overstocked with
Brooches, and for tho purpose of making a rapid
clearance of that line of Goods, we will send to
any customer (post free, if ata distance) on receipt
of Five Shillings (55.), a really exquisite Oriental
Gold Brooch, equal in design, finish, and appear-
ance to a Five Guinea Brooch of the sterling metal.
This offer holds good for a feto weeks only, and is
made as much for the purpose of advertising our
Oriental Jewellery by sample as for any other
reason ; for tho Brooches will keep, and they are
of the latest design. “To see is to want,” is a
saying so applicable toour goods, that it pays us,
in tho long run, to forward to any person a sample
Brooch at cost price. Examine our catalogue, and
write to us or call on ua for what you may desire.

cost less than £8 to £lO.

names of these unhappy authors that we fully ex-
pected to see one day the names of Chivot and
Duru transformed into Cheevers and Kennedy
When Mr. Musgrove first produced this piece, he
gave us a spectacle of extraordinary magnificence
and those who interpreted the various r»les were
with a few exceptions, artists. Battle Laverne
was Olivette; Harwood, the Duke des Ifs; Mervin
deMerrimac; Hallewell, Marvejol; and so on. Mr
Musgrove, however, has changed all this; and relv.
iog upon the indulgence of a confiding public has
given us a cast which, though doubtless cheap in
one sense, we trust he may not find dear In an-
other. Miss Fanny Liddiard is, ot course,.a very
comely, shapely, and (possibly) charming young
lady; but she is so ludicrously overweighted witl
the part of Olivette that, long before the opera is
over, you wish, despite all her undoubted attrac-
tions, that she were enjoying her Shroud com-
fortably in an airy vault, where the sea breezes
murmur the requiem of the dead and the fragrant
How’rets blossom above that lovely head—poetry
which, considering we went to last night's fire on
an engine and came back in an ice-cream cart, is
by no means of a discreditable nature. Bref, then
the pitchforking of Miss Liddiard into a part for
which she is totally unfitted to fill is doi g her an
unkindness as much as it is doing the public an
injustice. Miss Liddiard is an undoubted “ draw ’
amongst that section of the male community
whose intellects are represented by their sairt-
collars; therefore, her appearance on the stage is,
to some extent, a managerial necessity. Let the
charming lady appear, by all means. But don’t
let her sing to the extent of sending us weeping oil
to see the monkey-dance at the circus.

Mr. Philip Day (Mr. Harwood’s successor)
as the Duke des Its, gave a startlingly origina
representation—especially from a vocal point ol
view. Mr. Day it a capital low comedian; but
nature, not satisfied with thus endowing him his-
trionically, has lavished on this clever gentleman
a voice like the whirr of a circular-saw with a
mad dog barking next door. We always considerec
that Harwood, if the universe were polled, woulc
take the palm for atrocious vocalization; but then
this Day . had not yet dawned upon us. On the
opening night, there was evidently something
wrong with Mr. W. H. Woodfield, and his perform-
ance was of a dispiriting nature. Mr. T. Grundy,
as Postiche, did his best; but his efforts at no time
were conducive to more hilarity, so far as we are
concerned, than is caused by a death in the family.
Nellie Stewart as the Countess, and Edwin Kelly
as De Merrlmao were both eminently conscientious.
By the way, Kelly and Wybert Heove were born
(this item is for the almanac compilers) in the same
year. That must have been B.C.— we mean Anno
Domini 18671 The mounting was so-so (things can’t
last for ever I); but a number of the costumes
have been renewed. There were the usual eight
tribes of Judah in the dress-circle, and the Cloak-
room Countess as deliciously unconscious of the
performance as usual.
A lot of people are talking about Sea-
realle’s “Estrella,” which is to succeed—we mean to
succeed “Olivette”—and it seems that the action all
through is very quick, while the plot is graced by
several gleams ot novelty. There is balm in this;
and it will be a glittering spectacle to see the illus-
trious composer conducting his own composition.
Luscomba has gained both money and glory in
America, but that is not all. He has gained some-
thing else-a forehead. And it is right at the back
of his head.

Miss Jennie Lee is a young professional
person, who, if she be in any financial difficulty, is
singularly fortunate in misfortune. No such plea,
however, having been set forth in her behalf, the
fact of her taking the recent farewell—we mean
final farewell—benefit at the Koyal, when so many
of her Thespian sisters and brethren have long
been heel-less-even cow heel-less—was the subject
of some remark. Miss Jennie advertises—” Sydney
wos very good to me, it wos,” and with some
reason. This noble city enabled that—how we
love alliteration!—pretty professional young per-
son to net, in the dim religious light of a matm6e
on Saturday last, some £3OO. We are glad that Miss
Jennie Lee was so favourably circumstanced in
regard to the financial ponion of her speculation;
but, at the same time, we would suggest that the
beneficiare, in consideration of the munificence
with which she has been treated, should stand at
the office door of the Theatre Koyal on any given
morning, and distribute amongst the “ crushed ”
who congregate at the corner sandwiches and
“dickies,” for the contingent of wall-flowers to be
83en there is frequently hungry and seldom clean.

Miss Lee presented for her “ben.” what
is popularly termed “an attractive programme.”
Every company in Sydney, except the stilts and
the capine opera-buffers, had volunteered service;
the result of which kindness on the part of the
profession was to form an entertainment nearly
the length of the Mont Cenis tunnel. We
had the Minstrels, a “farcical” comedy by the
De Grey combination, a musical milange, a song
and dance by the Lee sisters (Jennie and Ada—the
latter recently imported, to the agonized grief,
doubtless, ot an admiring country!), some,
of "The Philanthropist” by George Forbes,
Esquire, and finally "Jo” to whom Sydney
was “ werry good, it wos.” The portion of the
programme which achieved the most success in
all the gorgeous list was the entertainment of the
Minstrels. If analysed, there will be found in this
truthful statement a meaning that is covert.
Horace Bent was in capital form, and told us that
he used to call his girl “ brown sugar” because she
was sweet and unrefined. Johnny Cowan—for-
merly the idol of the classic “Coll,” an .esthetic
place of amusement once conducted in Melbourne
by an illustrious impresario named Charlie Wright
—Johnny, who was the other end-man, was set
down for a comic song called “Is it likely ? ” Mr.
Cowan composes his own lyrics, which are chiefly
remarkable for one line having more “feet” than
a centipede and the next not having so many legs
as a “ goanna.” But one gem of this beautiful com-
position remains in our memory; it is the line
commencing
“The people of Inverell intend for to see—”
an effort which would alone suffice to stamp Mr*
Cowan as no ordinary versifier. We once heard a
man in Colon sing a song of this description in
Spanish; and he not only had the stamp we have
alluded to on him, but the public. Mr. L. Braham,
upon whose tuneful breast an ornament suggestive
of a tire insurance policy bravely gleamed, treated
us to “When the leaves begin to turn,” a lyric which
with the substitution of “worm” for “leaves,”
would at once constitute itself an attractive (and
not “pernicious”) parody. Mr. Braham sang
very well, indeed: as did also Bent, in a “comic
satire” (which, we trust, was not aimed at the
pretty benejiciare), “ Give what you can to those in
distress.”
• •
The Minstrels were succeeded by Miss
de Grey’s comedy company in “ Married Life,” as
aforesaid, and the result was depressing. The
piece is less droll than a colliery explosion; and we
consider It an act of considerate delicacy on Miss
de Grey's part to have concealed the name of the
misguided author. Let us state, that the Indiffer-
ent success of the piece was by no means duo to
Miss de Grey, who was too busy prompting to be
able to chip in with her own lines, but was mainly
due to the partial ignorance of the text displayed
by the other performers. In the end, the curtain
was lowered .lust as people were commencing to
wonder what it was about, and for a fow moments
the demon Gloom held the audience in his sombre
grasp. So much for “ Married Life,” of which a
good many of us have had enough in a double
sensei Next came the musical melons—we mean
melange—which being musical was started by a
recitation of “The Uncle” by Mr. Philip Day.
Until Mr. Day warmed to his work it wasgenerallv
considered by the audience that he was more for-
tunate in his tailor than in his oratory. Being,
however, at an early stage requested, by an angry
pitite, to “speak up,” Mr. Day complied and his
efforts were received with quite as much favour
as they deserved. The next item on the pro-
gramme was “At Last,” to be sung by Miss Nellie
Stewart; and Miss Nellie would, doubtless, have
scored a big triumph had she not had a prior en-
gagement—at the sports. But Mr. W. H. Wood-
fleld filled the gap with a Scottish song of a lugu-
brious nature—the kind of lyric which goes so far
to reconcile one to the nearest Necroplis. Miss
Gracie Plaisted putting in a quick appearance,
just as Mr. W. had concluded his unmelodious
Highland Fling, saved that gentleman, doubtless,
from dismemberment. Miss Grade was at-
tended by Mr. Luscombe Searealle, who
accompanied her on the piano. The song
“ At the Fair,” written and composed by
Luscombe, was a great success, and both artistes
retired at its conclusion enveloped in blushes and
covered with glory, A great deal of interest was
attached to the appearance of Mr. Searealle, and the
elegance of his “ get up ” made, it was evident, a
profound impression, Luscombe, though little in
one sense, is great in another, and report speaks
loftily, not only of his “ Estrella ” (which we shall
sec on Saturday), but of several other of the scores
which are packed, sardine-like, in his operatic
portmanteau. After “ At the Fair.” we bad a song
and dance by Miss Jennie and Miss Ada Lee. The
impression indented on our minds by this per-
formance was that, though we are quite willing
that Miss Jennie Lee should sing in Sydney, we
would be equally agreeable to Miss Ada Lee danc-
ing in Darmstadt. Miss Jennie looked prettier
than a great many pictures, though we could have
wished she had not been quite so conscious of her
feathers.
♦ * *
After this, Mr. Wybert Reeve came on, and
made love to Miss Maggie Knight, in “ The Philan-
thropist.” Mr. Wybert Keevei considering his
youth, is quite an adept «t “ spooning,” and the
appearance of Miss Knight was really dazzling.
There can be no doubt whatever that, taking her
altogether, Miss Knight is the best ingenue at pre-
sent on the colonial stage. And this is saying a
great deal—for Miss Maggie Knight; though,
whether it is saying a great deal for the colonial
stage is a point upon which our natural delicacy
forbids us to dilate. Then “Jo,” and with Myra
Kemble as Lady Dedlock. Myra has had a
year’s holiday now, and considers it quite time to
return to business. Well, wo think so, too. It is a
long time since we had a year’s holiday, but we
remember at the expiration of that period various
circumstances suggested the advisability of our
return to graft. We can recollect two of the cir-
cumstances with peculiar clearness. One right
boot, and one left shoe.
* * *
The Misses Lee are, then, off to England,
d ce que Von (lit. This being the case, it might not,
perhaps, be out of place to recommend Miss Ada
to, when taking her passage on board the boat,
engage one berth for herself and another for her
song-and-dance shoes. The audience, wo may aid,
was unusually brilliant; and it is rumoured that
at the conclusion of the performance. Lady Lof tus,
who was presjnt, sent the vivacious benefl>;iare
round a basket; though, whether it contained tish
or flowers, we are not in a position to determine.
Miss Lee, we may add, has announced her Inten-
tion (as if that were news I) of returning to Aus-
tralia; and, furthermore, she states she will bring
with her all the best pieces she is able to secure.
There is something comforting in this. Miss Lee,
however, is favourably situated with regard to
the acquirements of dramatic rarities. She has a
distinguished author on the premises.

At the Opera House, Miss Marie de Grey
seems to have conquered without having gone to
the trouble of much stooping; and that the case
stands thus is a feather in the cap of Allison the
msthetic, for importing that charming lady and
her company. But James has always been cele-
brated for his fine discriminating powers wherever
a question of art has been concerned, and, there-
fore, we who have growing boys and girls (thun-
der I what a price boots are !) are under an obliga-
tion to him of no small dimensions. The ensemble
of the de Grey company evinces, on part of the
“star,” much taste and not a little discrimination.
We are all, of course, liable to mistakes; and once
James fell into one. That was when the curtain
rose on “Cymbeline, King of Britain ,” and Pome-
roy (Imogen) was discovered standing on a ’possum-
skin rug! it is only fair to Jim, however, to
state that he instantly ordered the obnoxious prop
to be removed, and substituted some mats made
of Hawaiian dogs’-tails (a present from King
Kamehameha). “ As .if everybody didn’t know,”
cried the manager, indignantly, " that Cymbeline
never put up the stuff to start out Captain Cook.
Damme, I’ll have no anacrostics in my theatre I”
There are no ’possum or kangaroo-rugs in “ She
Stoops to Conquer:” Indeed, thej costumes and
some of the accessories might have been copied
from authorities in the British Museum—as very
likely they were—or else made from designs by
the Hon. Lewis Wingfield, who, next to Leopold
Jordan, is the most versatile man living. He is an
artist, virtuoso, journalist, and dramatist. But
Leopold licks him by two holes—he being, in addi-
tion to what we have quoted, a maestro and an
entertainer.
* * *
Of the acting of the piece we have spoken;
but we forget now whether we mentioned or not
that it was by Oliver Ooldsmith. That is the case,
anyhow. Our colonial dramatists are therefore
relieved, at once, from the stigma of having
penned a comedy in five acts ! The latest edition
to colonial literalure, “The Philanthropist,” you
will remember, is only in three. Talking of the
Opera House, by the way, we might suggest that
the removal ot the sunlight in thereof and the
substitution of additional brackets would be an
improvement. As so many “financial agents”
patronise the dress-circle during the run of
“ beauty-pieces ” it seems unfair on part of the
management to remind them in this world of
what will most certainly be.their lot in the next.

Let our tongue follow our ped while w©
write about the Circus. That Madame Woody ear
has natural good taste besides equestrian talent is
exemplified by the general get up of the tent,
which is quite an innovation on the stereotyped
equestrian marquee. It is all new and bright, and
the show rattles along at a great rate—both the
clowns, Kusko and Max Wrinkle, mercifully avoid
unfolding theix budgets of “infinite humour” in
course of the same evening. They don’t wish to
break the hearts of the distinguished members of
the audience who write for the comic papers.
Talking of Max, we will give you a Wrinkle. He
is going to sing a new topical song on Saturday,
written expressly for him by (it is assumed) a sub-
urban alderman who shall be nameless. Wo trust,
on that occasion, the man in the band who mani-
pulates the trombone will restrain his ardour.
People are fearfully familiar with hits notes, and
want to hear Max Wrinkle’s words.
* * *
A greater card, probably, which Madame
has to play on Saturday next, is Donald Dinnie, the
gentle creature who threw Miller over his shoulder
and broke his leg. Donald is ready to meet all-
comers at anything—from tossing the caber to a
Grreco-Roman wrestle. You can have, at his
hands, a broken back in any style you please, both
on the European and American plans. Tho secret
of Dinnie's wonderful strength has never leaked
out, though there is a rumour in sporting circles
that it is owing to his training exclusively on
snutf. That’s what, you see, in wrestling wouid
give a man strength in his sneeze.

The new programme is chiefly remarkable
for the manipulation, by Mr. Equestrian Director
Sylvester, of two wonderful ponies, Duke and
Richmond; and Miss Ruby Scarsdale docs a singu-
larly graceful and daring act upon the single
trapeze. The Woodward Brothers, who are
oystered upon the magic ladders, give a lino show;
and all the tumbling—especially that of the Jao.

It is healthy news to learn that M‘Mahon’s
“ Romeo and Juliet ” combination, with the Irving
scenery, has turned out a success at the Melbourne
Opera House. We really think it is time the people
showed that they were aweary of Jingling hors
d inures, and ready to welcome the legitimate joint.
Mr. Prank Cates is the Romeo, a role which was
“to be entrusted to a colonial actor.” Since Mr.
J. P. West is billed as a member of the London
Comedy Company, we suppose Mr. Prank Cates is
fairly entitled to be considered a Colonial actor.
Macmillan's Magazine says that “ Miss Panny
Reid as Juliet is all that Juliet can be;” but of
Mr. Brian parley, who plays Mercutio, wo can
glean nothing. We, however, naturally expect
some “wholesome fun” at bis bands before he is
pinked by Tybalt. We notice that the stage-man-
ager is Mr. Bragglngton—not a bad name for a
modest professional—and that the incidental music
is by Sir Jules Benedict, who, owing to his great
age, was doubtless at one time enabled to take in-
structions from the author.
" THE POOR PLAYER.”
Correspondence is invited from members of the
Theatrical Profession. ]
Tho orattan Riggs party have taken Bris-
bane by storm, as might be expected after so suc-
cessful a season in Sydney not long ago. Charlie
M’Mahon writes to say that he intends bringing
tho Irish comedian back to Sydney after tho
Queensland tour, to open hero on November Ist.
And this reminds us'that M,Mahon has leased
two theatres lor the Christmas season, that is, the
Hobart Theatre for 15 weeks and the Princess
Theatre, Sandhurst. He is going to play Riggs at
Sandhurst, and is now getting together ti company
to open the Hobart Theatre with on tho first
night of the Hobart races. And now wo
are going to toll you a yarn about Charlie
that hasn’t got around much as yot. Not long
since, Rigss and Charlie were travelling together
on the overland route from Sydney. Charlie was
tired, and it being night time, secured a berth and
turned in. Later on in the night, a fussy old maid
from somewhere, got in at ono of tho stations and
raised a fearful rauket because there was no spare
berth for her. Grattan had just entered the car,
Intending to “turn in” also, if there was any
chance; but there wasn't. However, he deter-
mined to help the old maid out if he could, so
approaching her in the politest manner possible,
he said“ Madam, I have just left my berth, as the
Jolting of the train made my head ache, and I
couldn’t sleep. The berth is at your disposal.
My little boy is in it now, fast asleep, but
you will most certainly find plenty of room, and
he won’t disturb you.” The lady was profuse in
her thanks, and Grattan retired to the smoking-
carriage. Maybe, you don’t know Charlie
M Mahon. Weil, then, we must tell you that he
isn’t any bigger than his brother Jimmie, and that
Jimmie hides himself under a tea-cup every time
he sees an impecunious reporter coming to borrow
a shilling. Charlie was lying well over to the
back of the berth, and the ancient maid “turned
in ” with her clothes on. Her advent caused
Charlie to groan a little, then he yawned and
began to stretch. " Lie still, sonny,” said the old
girl, soothingly; “your papa said 1 might
lie beside you a little while.” By this time
Charlie was wide awake. Turning his bright
grey eyes on the maid he said, sharply:
“Who in the devil are you? Whose papa? I
haven’t any papa in this string of buggies. I’m
Mr. Charles M’Mahon, proprietor and manager of
tho Grattan Riggs Dramatic Company, and if you
don’t get out of this quicker'n greased llgbtninir,
there’ll bo the dog-gonedest scandal around here
that ever shook the colonies to their centre.”
Then he struck a lucifer. The old maid saw his
whiskers, and, with a scream that nothing else but
the sight of a mouse could have inspired, she
bounded from the bunk bald-headed, leaving her
wig behind. We’re not going to vouch for the
truth of this story, of course, for we’ve forgotten
for the moment just who told it to us. We have a
suspicion, however, that the man, whoever he
was, if not a first-class liar already, was in a fair
way to become one with a little more practice.
The English Wesleyan Conference have
aftain decided that there is a hell—a real, hot,
human grill-room, where live people are toasted
on tho coals and turned with red-hot pitchforks.
Several members spoke very strongly in favour of
adhering strictly to the Methodist doctrine on the
subject. Ultimately, the Rev. W. J. Frankland,
the minister who gave rise to the debate, was made
a supernumerary, and inhibited from preaching in
Wesleyan pulpits. A motion for his expulsion was
lost—which shows that there is still some little
chance tor the no-hell party.
On Monday evening there was another
meeting relative to the championship imbroglio.
Beach met Hanlan to arrange relative to the chal-
lenge issued by the latter; but the Beach-Clifford
match formed the principal theme of discussion.
Hanlan wanted Beach to explain his position. If
he rowed Clifford first, how was he to give Han-
lan a championship match, since Clifford might
win and be champion at the time when Beach
would row Hanlan. After a long discussion,
no conclusion was arrived at. Wc have ar-
rived at a conclusion, however. The very
title of “Champion” is suggestive of chival-
rous conduct. The dealings of Beach and his
backers m relation to Hanlan have been the very
.reverse of chivalrous; and we believe the people
of Australia will very soon, unless the Beach party
change their tactics, show unmistakeably that
they are sick of their Champion and of having the
the colonies, for manly, straightforward
conduct in sporting matters, dragged through the
dirt.


PEPPER AND SALT.
A schoolmaster at Avenel —a little one-
horse town down South—who was had up for un-
mercifully whacking the back of a scholar, j ustifled
bis action by explaining that “ he persisted in
hinging paper wads at him when his back was
turned.” This is no excuse. We once taught
school out in the “ wilds,” and about every half-
hour had to remove our coat and scrape off the
dried paper wads adhering to the nap. We never
allowed a trifle like this to ruffle our composure-
nary a ruffle; we just kept on wearing that gaber-
dine till It had no nap and the wads wouldn’t stick.
But when they took to dipping them in mucilage,
we complained to the directors. “Young man,”
said the chairman, “ef you don‘t like our ways
you'd better hawk your swag and git. Skoolmaster
Bangs tort skule yer for more’n six months, and
he never said a word agin the wads.” We mildly
sugested that perhaps Mr. Bangs was brought up
to paper wads, and didn’t mind them. “ It ain’t
no use,” said another director; “ the children hev
got to be amused.” We protested that there were
other amusemeuts quite as diverting. But the
third director here rose and remarked, “Ipuffectly
agree with the cheer; this youngster’d better
travel. I consider as paper wfeds lies at the r&pt
ov popi lar edicashun: ther’ a necissary adjunck 1

The Herald of Thursday has an article on
Mudgee commencing “Forty Years Ago,” which
is all we have read of it. This reminds us of the
heavy father, in the farce, who, when the young
lady in white muslin and a appears, leads
her down to the footlights, and then placing two
chairs, commences, “ My dear ycuc# lady, it was
just fifty years since when your mother, upon her
dying Lei, cor tided you to my care.” Then you
know you are “in for it,” and run away to the
circus. With regard to the Herald, however, you
don’t do this. You only send out the bottle and
take up the Protestant Standard. Talking of
the P.S. (to be chatty), it seems, since M'Gibbon
became a cherub, to have grown into a singularly
mild production. Now it is only venomous; before
it used to be bitter. But we suppose Dr. M‘Gibbon
can’t help this. It must take up about all his time
to keep his halo on this windy weather,

Charles Byron Martin, the Shakespearian
reciter, is making quite a tiiumphal tour through
the country towns. At Tamworth, his recitals
were received with a fury of applause from which
he modestly retired with an obliterated optic aid
a swollen nose. When the recitals were finished,
his tragic face was like an unskilfully prepared
omelette. The audience egged him on all the
. _ . ~ ,
time. Charles Byron .8 probably the only man on
record who has made a success of counting his
chickens before they were hatched He has had
crowded houses wherever he has performed And
this makes us think that Charles Byron is either a
very clever fellow, who has elected to act the fool
for the sake of lucre, or a born fool, who has made
a very wise use of his tolly. A first-class trage-
dian would probably have had appreciative but
scanty audiences, where he has had crowded i£
scornful ones. There is frequently much wisdom
under the cap and bells. Ask A. G. Taylor.

Five little weeks ago, the Adelong Literary-
Institute was started in a blaze of glory. A code
of regulations, as compx-ehensive as the Justinian
Code and as rigid as the laws of Draco, was estab-
lished. No smoking was to be allowed, and no
drinking. The proceedings were to be carried on
in philosophic calm. Everything from poetry to
politics, from literature to lamp-lighting, was to
be freely and exhrustively discussed. A president,
vice president, secretary, treasurer, and commit-
tee were elected. The first meeting was to be held
a month from that date—that is to say, one night
last week. The night came: the hall was opened;
the hall-keeper lit the gas. Half an hour after, one

gave you up. Take a hand, and make it out,
throat.” The Vice-President fell into the snare-
and sat down to the game. In a few minute-
there was another interruption. It was the Secre-
tary this time. “Have you been at the hall?”
cried all three together. “ No,” replied the Secre-
tary, with a guilty look. “Of course, you have
not,” said the President, with some bitterness.
“We were there waiting for you t'll we were
tired." Then, angrily, “If this |is what you call
carrying out the regulations, I’d just as soon
chuck up my office now as not.” Then, relent-
ingly. “ But, as you’re here, we may as well cut for
partners, and make it a four-handed game.” They
cut for partners, and they made it a four-handed
game. Ten festive minutes passed in this way,
when four flushed committee-men, who had been
mutually improving themselves with whisky,
burst upon the scene. The four superior officers
glared at them with amalgamated scorn, and then
put the crucial question to them, which they
answered with a hoarse but humble negative.
After some cutting remarks from the Presi-
dent and the three other conspirators, they
were pardoned, and allowed to bet on
the game. But Nemesis was on their track.
The door slowly opened, and in came a fifth
committee-man. On him the President turned
with savage sarcasm (intensified, probably, by his
having lost two games running), and said, “ So it’s
you, is it. Lord Bacon, eh ? Sage I” (with a sneer-

and looking round at the company, as if in doubt
whether aword could ba found mean enough to
describe them, and giving it up at “gang.” The
four committee-mem who had preceded this one
looked at the four superior officers. The Secre-
tary glared at the three. The Vice-President
scowled at the two. And the two were speechless
as the frozen dead, until the wandering hand of
the President touched the bell, and the landlord
came in to get the names of the drinks. “ Mine-
all mine; boys, this is my shout,” said the Presi-
dent, with a trembling eagerness which it was pain-
ful to witness. This evidence of a desire to atone
for his duplicity conquered his soft-hearted
associates at once, and be was pardoned on the spot*
Fired by this generous conduct, he proposed that,
as soon as they had drunk up, they should go
round to the Hall in a body and see who were there
then. The proposal was received with applause*
and they drank up and went round. When they
got there they found the gas still burning, buf
only one member ’of the Institute present—the
committee-man who had come in with a hiccup
an hour before, and was now stretched out in a
stertorous slumber with his head on the “ Official
History of New South Wales,” which had been
presented to the institution by -Government a few
days before. He was a gorgeous spectacle. The
ingenious youth of the neighbourhood, led by the
son of the hall-keeper-a juvenile humourist
of the Huckleberry Finn type—had come in
while he was asleep and decorated his coun-
tenance with many and fearful designs in
charcoal, till he presented an appearance which
might have been termed wholly of the goblin cast
if it had not partaken equally of the nature of a
nightmare. They shook him by the shoulder and
woke him up. He rose to his feet unsteadily, and
after taking a confused inventory of the company,
began to speak, “ Worshy Preshdnt ’n’ bruzhers
all,” said he, “I shtan pon dignity. Thish nosh
time t’ minsh marrers. I’m f ’ Local Opsh’n, I am.
Gimme nuzher drink.” Then he made a wild re-
volution on his heel, and fell proae and speechless
on the floor. The company looked at each other
for a moment in mute suspense. The President
spoke first. “Boys," he said, “dam Mutual Im-
provement! Let's shake in the hat. Here’s my
shilling.” And in gloomy dissipation and unholy
revelry ended the first meeting of the Literary In-
stitute of Adeiong.

The newest discovery is a good one. It is
a receipt for soothing fiend-possessed babies to
sleep. First you get your baby. Then you get
a little trough, into which you put your baby
Over this you place a filter, from which you let a
stream of water trickle on the vertex of the in-
fant’s cranium, and your baby sleeps as long as
you like. Of course it gets water on the brain, but
that is a small matter, as long as you are not dis-
turbed. We fancy, though, that a better plan
would be to let the water trickle into the Infant
mouth whenever it was opened to yell. This would
not only silence it, but give the child an early
lesson in self-restraint. It would also be a notable
method for nipping embryo Dan O’Connors in the
bud.

A scientist has found that most men have

Look at a reporter turning a street corner.
Mechanically he diverges into the corner-bar, and
mechanically he edges round to the side where the

dive away from the scene of a fight, and come up
sternly to the social surface two streets off. Even
a parson- walking, to all appearance, the straight
and narrow road that leads to salvation—occasion-

us of an anecdote concerning a Sydney clergyman,

hungry hand. “It won’t do, my man,” replied
his reverence, “ I’m in the business myself!” You
can believe this or not, as you like, but, if not
literally true, it most certainly is in spirit. So
there is nothing so fresh about this discovery of
the bias, after all.

The Day Dawn claim at Charters Towers,

pected that the dividends receivable in future by
the lucky shareholders will quite reach £IOO,OOO
per annum. Messrs. Christian and Pfeiffer own

perty. But even the colossal wealth of the Day
Dawn (one of the richest of whose proprietors was
once so poor that when a working miner a few

Four Frenchmen arrive on the coast of
Queensland in an open boat, and land. After
wandering in search of a settlement they at last
reached Cooktown, where they hre arrested under
the Vagrancy Act (though in possession of some
£b), charged with having no fixed place of abode,
and committed to gaol for three months. “ The
only deduction,” says the Cairns Post, “ that can
be drawn from such a sentence is that it is a crime
punishable by imprisonment for any person to
lEud in Queensland without having previously
secured some place of abode; the mere fact of
being able and willing to pay for the same on
arrival being no extenuating circumstance to
urge in mitigation of the offence. If this be a
correct reading of the Act, then all commercial
travellers who are so incautious as to leave their
steamers before bespeaking an apartment, or all
visitors who are venturesome enough to land in
this colony, are liable to be arrested and summarily
committed to gaol for three months.” What an
almighty ro a there’d be if four Englishmen land-
ing in (say) China wore treated in anything like
the same sort of inhuman, cowardly way.

Department of Public Instruction,
Sydney, 10th September, 1884.
TENDERS FOR ALTERATIONS AND
IMPROVEMENTS.
ffIENDERS are invited for Alterations and Im-
I provements to the Fort-street Superior Pub-
lic School.
Plans and Specifications may be seen, and Forms
of Tender obtained at the office of the Depart-
ment of Public Instruction, Sydney.
Tenders, endorsed “ Tender for Alterations and
Improvements, Fort-street Public School,” must
be lodged with the Acting Under-Secretary, De-
partment of Public Instruction, at or before 10
o’clock a.m., on Wednesday, 24th September, 1884.
The Minister does not bind himself to accept the
or an y Tender.

“ We (Wentworth Advocate) learn that
whilst Mr. Pegler was driving into town, the tire
of one of his buggy wheels burst.”; [A late wire, in

session of our usual equanimity. The tire, it is
rumoured in town, is to be repaired.—Ed. B.]
Says the Gundaoai Times : —“ 11 us kin asks
‘ What Is there more beautiful than the word
wife ? ’ We should say the wife herself.” We
should say—in the present state of society—the
cook. But it depends a good deal upon whose
wife is referred to. If one’s own, the cook, of
course.
The Newcastle Herald says, in reference
to a nautical inquiry held lately, that ”it was
found that the captain had been guilty of an error
of judgment in standing on the western tack too
long.” We should say so. Any man who would
stand on a tack, w hichever way it pointed, is plainly
no sage, to say the least of it.
The Nooze says that the gaol doctor gave
Hawthorn a glass of brandy to sustain him until
the trying ordeal was over. Hang it, the trying
ordeal was over when the jury found him guilty.
“ Tying ordeal ” would have been a better phrase,
or “scragging process” better still; but the
Nooze is so demnitlon euphemistic, at the expense
of truth.
The wife of a certain mutton millionaire
recently engaged a “ lady’s maid ” in England.
Next day, the maid banded to her mistress a letter.
"Marie,” sternly said Mrs. Mutton, “don’t you

tray?” “Oh, yes, madame,” replied the damsel;
“only I wasn’t quite sure whether you knew
about it.«
A lately presented return shows that the
number of public-houses in the city of Melbourne
is at present 38(1, and that, during the past ten
years, the police opposed the granting of a license
to no applicant on the simple ground that his
his house was a brothel only.” This disciplined
delicacy on the part of the foorce has sent the eye-
brows of the average citizen up under his hat.
Years ago, the spirit of prophecy came on
Bouoloault, and lifting up his voice he said: "Egypt
was fatal to Assyria, to the Hebrews, to St. George
who was hung for looting and to Napoleon. It is
the graveyard of the world, and England has gone
there to steal a lot for a quiet family vault. If
we could only get the old man to tip us the winner
of the next Melbourne Cup as straight as the above
appears to be, we’d break the ring and burst up all
Sir Salmon Wilson’s earthly chances tor that
peerage.
“It is with pain,” says the Wentworth
Ad., “that we are compelled to chronicle the
melancholy fact that a decomposed and very
fragrant puppy has been lying in Helena-street
for some days.” The llrst news par. apologises for
the late appearance of the paper. Some rumpus
with typos ? Cruel, however, to leave the poet of
the journal unburied, and crueller to pretend it
was melancholy. The paper is ever so much more
cheerful now.
A Wentworth paper, referring to the fact
that a few wool-barges went dawn the Darling
lately, speaks of it as “this activity m shipping
circles.” This is the spirited sort of journalism
we admire. We are waiting now to hear that
“ public feeling ran high ” in the contests for the
bellmanship—if that office is not, as we suspect it
is, hereditary in the family of the editor. But it
must be. Even he could not be such a vessel of
brass if it were not.
Like Mother Seigel’s syrup, “ this is worth
a trial.” TheJNew York Herald says:—“ In olden
times, an immigrant preferred to remain in New
York and run for Alderman. When he chanced
to fail at this, he went into the police force, or
opened up a whisky mill. Now-a-days, however,
he goes West, selects land, and earns his living as
honestly as if he were a native.” To how many of
our coming l men could we with prolit to this
country say: Go thou and do likewise ?
Speaking of the liquor that was to flow at
the housewarming of a new hotel in Bourke, one
of the local editors says; “w e mean to take an
extra meal of sponge for this occasion. Ill-
natured persons would construe this into meaning
that ho was going to sponge more than ever on
“this occasion. Which shows how cautious
edhors—and especially Bourke editors-shouldl be
in joking about their own weaknesses. It is bad
enough when somebody else does it.
The model human form demands that the
stature should be exactly six times the length of
the foot. From a boot found at the rear of the
News office and forwarded secretly to Professor
Huxley, he has been compelled to consider how to
recast his great system of classification until he
has indisputable evidence of his now having been
imposed upon. He has written to Henniker Heaton
to know if it is actually true that the men on the
staff of his old paper ever attain the height of ten
feet eleven inches.
It was the annual tea-gathering of the
Duokponds Free Independent Peculiar Baptist
School children, and Tommy jvas there. The tea,
if weak, was plentiful; the bread, if but thinly-
touched with “rancid," was abundant; and the
cake, though weighty, was piled mountains high.
In less than half an hour, Tommy paused in his
avocation. The Rev. Jeremiah Snoggmgs (Cir-
cuit Pastor) approached. “My boy, quoth the
divine, “you don’t get on. My stomach do
ache, sir,’’ responded Thomas. Then don t you
think you had better go home? ’ suggested the
minister. " No, sir; he’ll have to ache a good deal
more afore I go.”
Mackay, the Silver King, has only got capi-
talised property to the value of 55 millions sterling,
and can, therefore, only spend £o a minute with-
out touching his principal. It is hard for a man to
be hampered in this fashion when there are tons
of thousands of people who eat one meal a day
regularly when they might very well manage to
live on a meal every two days. The selfishness of
the lower classes has always been in the way of
those who would pile up myriads of gold. There
is far too much vulgar hunger among the lower
classes. They should join Sunaay-schools, and go
to picnics.
Thank God, the down-trodden Irish race
will now be able to curse their oppressors without
fear of being fined for seditious language. The
Commissioners of National Education in Ireland
have consented to allow the Irish language to be
taught in the National Schools. The patriotic
party see in this only the first of a whole series of
concessions to be wrung from the bloody Saxon.
The next on the list will probably be a permission
to establish dynamite classes in the higher schools.

moments of cruel exasperation, have held their

use in more dangerous complaints.

aad people over the Franchise Bill ?” We suppose
you’ve heard of gammer Partington and her mop.
and of George Stephenson’s cow on the railway ?
We hope (the Lords (how the word sticks in our
throat!) will tight to what the Rum people call the
“ bitter end ”—be more mulish than they were 62
years ago. Then there 11 be a chance of sweeping
them and theirs into ignominious oblivion for ever-
more....” Vox”: What is our raison d’etre ? Why,
to support the Church and make life enjoyable to
smug rascaldom, of course —just like other papers.
As if you didn’t know.. “Mechanic”: You think us
an authority on the theory of flight. So we are.
But there are various kinds of “flight.” If you
mean that of birds, you are on the wrong tack
altogether—hopelessly wrong. Until you quite
ignore that fatal word “ buoyancy,” you’ll never
solve the problem....“ Pourquoi”: For really lucid
statements of the present European outlook, you
must go to the country press. Now that civilisa-
tion is being pushed so rapidly forward, the only
people able to treat the subject exhaustively ap-
pear to gravitate towards Cooper’s Creek and
the overland telegraph line “W.E.'": Thanks...
“ Topsv”: Pleasant enough reading for a “family
magazine,” but not at all in our line—‘‘Kiama
Ghost” (Euston): A fabulous being who is said
to have fired an empty gun at the still emptier
head of a Kiama J.P. Better write to Sir ’Bnry
himself for full particulars...“ Surveyor” (Cooma):
Not enough vim in your last. Truth is not always
stranger than fiction: hence the statement of the
Eerson referred to, that the Mayor, aldermen, and
e himself are liars, lacks interest. Look up your
time-payment Bible, and you’ll And King David
was of opinion that “all men are liars;” and if he
didn't know, who does?
Mr. J. A. Brion, of Nourea, has handed the
Wellington Gazette tho following:—“ A most
extraordinary freak of nature has occurred here
in the shape of a well-developed double heifer calf
of a roan colour, having two heads, six legs, one
neck and body, and minus a tail; the two heads are
equally placed on the neck, and the four hind legs
with two udders are in a most perfect form and
size. To all apppearances she must have been
alive to within a short time of her birth.” The
editor of the Gazette informed Mr. Bricn that he
would cheerfully take in all about the legs, &0., in
the interest of science. But as far as the spare
head was concerned, speaking personally, he was
“full ut>.”
In the Dublin Zoological Gardens, a line
lioness has eaten her own tail. One day she re-
moved twelve inches of this appendage, and after
an interval renewed her repast and swallowed
more. The tail has entirely disappeared, and the
animal has now commenced to eat one of htr fore
paws. The poor creature will probably be de-
stroyed. Another wild beast item is that at Saint
Etienne a tamer named Agop, while performing
at an exhibition, was attacked by a tiger, and a
terrific struggle ensued. The audience, panic-
stricken, rushed for the doors, when Agop suc-
ceeded in releasing himself, and in spite of his
wounds, entered the lion’s cage to conclude his
performance.
Talk about enterprise and push—well, a
party who writes in a holy orders sort of fist ob-
serves that the proprietor of a first-class hotel be-
tween 10 and 1000 miles from Sydney, being fired
with a burning desire to train up a child in the
way he should go, dispenses with the services of a
billiard-marker by employing his own son (cet. 11),
at a salary of nothing a week an 4 find himself, to
mind his billiard-room at night-time. This works
two ways, because the picturesque chat of the
pool-players, as the night wears on and the unlucky
are being skinned, improves the youngster s mind;
while the fact of his being kept out of bed till the
wee sma’ hours appears to act just as beneficially
on his body, and so works out the old Romans
idea of mens sana in corpora sano. A second tame
is now added to the hotel, and this is under the
care of the stable-boy, except when the horses
have to be bedded down, and then the Celestial
cook looks in and yells, “ Gleon upon led; spotee
have it in ban’. Littee gingee beah fo’ me, sah.
For a high-falutin’, llapdoodlin’ style of
diction, Sir George Bowen takes not only the cake,
but the whole bakery, including the horse and
cart, and the baker’s wife, from all-comers. This
is the sort of swill he slung in bis official despatch
on the death of the Duke of Albany:—“My Lord,
I have the honour to report that the intelligence
by telegraph of the death of His Royal Highness
Prince Leooold, Duke of Albany, caused universal
sorrow in this community. 2. I transmit here-
with, to be laid before Her Majesty, copies of the
address of condolence to the Queen, unanimously
adopted by the Legislative Council of Hongkong.
3. as 1 write, the batteries on shore, and the En-
glish, French, German, Italian, Russian, and Ame-
rican men-of-war at anchor here are firing each
thirty (30) minute guns in observance of the funeral
of the Duke of Albany, which is being celebrated
at Windsor on this day. It is a grand spectacle in
the magnificent harbour of Hongkong, which re-
calls the beauties of Corfu and of Spezzia. The
mountains of the neighbouring mainland of China
are re-echoing the roar of the European and Ame-
rican cannon—a grand requiem for the lamented
Prince in this extreme outpost of the British Em-
pire in the Far East,—l have, &c., G. F. Bowen-
Who wouldn’t be a dead prince for the sake of
such a grand, such a glorious requiem ? And how
sheepish I‘eter must feel when he gruffly ssksi the
prince who he is, and the visitor proudly replies:
“Me! —l’m the distinguished party in whose
honour all that firing is going on below there. Be
so good as to inform the seraphim I’ve just arrived,
and I’m quite displeased to find there is no one
here to meet me.” ;And then, again, how consoling
it must be to the bereaved ones to know that tho
grand spectacle recalled the beauties of Corfu and
Spezzia I Nothing in the way of sympathy has
been more tender and delicate since the day when
a widow stood by the grave of all she loved, and
so touched a big-hearted old digger by the violence
of her grief, that he edged up to her and said-
“ Missus, I’m blarated sorry for yer trouble—l am
indeed. An’ if it would do you any good, I’d like
t’ leu you a five pun’ note till y’ gets another hus-
band.” Some one ought to shave Sir George’s
head, and then soak it for a week in the magnifi-
cent harbour of Hongkong.
Before and since Tom Hood drew croco
dile tears from sham-repentant old with h)«
incomparable “Bridge of Sighs,” newspapers—
especially penny newspapers—have shown a pen
chant for waxing pathetic, In police reports, upon
the subject of “ unfortunates.” It isn’t often, cer
tainly, that knights of the shorthand give anv
practical proof of sympathy by forwarding the
price of a par. to the object of their commiseration
still they do express themselves very feelingly at
times. The Melbourne Herald, for instance
brought a lump into our throat the other day with’
the old, old story—“No roof was left, and she
slept in the open air, under the precarious shelter
of timber stacks, or crawled, perchance, under
some old shed in a back yard. Such tales as this
are told almost daily to the magistrates, and the
frequenters of the court even receive them with
hilarity. The unfortunate woman, still almost
young, was sent to prison under a brief term
What remains for her but the river?” Now’
we’ve read worse bits than that. Any reference
to the river always fetches us, so we tried to turn
out a poem about the girl who so amused the fre-
quenters of the Melbourne police court. We
couldn’t get further than two verses, but, such as
they are, you might And time for a tear over ’em—
Poor wretched wreck, with hair unkempt
And face with filth bespattered—
Though now a jeering court’s contempt,
She once was fair and flattered;
For fellows do flatter when women are young,
With a smiling face and a lying tongue,
(Other poets upon the same subject have sung)
And prospects bright get shattered.
Of beauty, friends, good name bereft,
No refuge, save the river.
For creatures such as she is left,
It only costs one shiver—
One muttered prayer—one bold plunge in,
And then, good-bye to the world’s dull din,
And a wasted life of shame and sin,
(For which, may Heaven forgive her!)
One good point about our humorous visi-
tor, the versatile variola, is that it is no respecter
of persons, but, like the gentle rain, it droppeth
alike on the just Milburn Creeker, and the unjust.
Saw bath-desecrating publican. Neither is it af-
fected by the Influence of filthy lucre, either— and
in this respect, how superior is even the small-pox
to the majority of our pulpit-thumpers—for it
calls to the prince of the royal house, and catches
on to his azure blood with the same easy familiarity
that it drops on to Lazarus as he lies in the gutter,
and makes rock-salt of himself, as it were, for
every dog that passes by. Thoughts like these
have recently struck one Dr. Gairdner, and being
a pugnacious sort of party, the worthy doctor at
once struck back, and in defence of the impartiality
of variola he has traced its record in connection
with the history of a few royal houses. Thus, of
the descendants of Charles I. of Great Britain, he
finds that of his forty-two lineal descendants up to
the date of 1712, five were killed outright by small-
pox, viz., his son Henry, Duke of Gloucester, and
his daughter Mary, wife of the Prince of Orange
and mother of William III; and three of the chil-
dren of James 11., viz., Charles, Duke of Cam-
bridge. in 1677; Mary, Queen of England, and wife
of William 111., in 1694: and the Princess Marie
Louise, in April, 1712. This, by the way, does not
include severe attacks not fatal, such as those
which scourged Queen Anne and Good King Billy
of glorious memory, whose face looked as if it had
been made red-hot and was then danced upon by
the hob-nailed boots of a thousand savvies. Of
the immediate descendants of the Biyne Water
hero’s contemporary, Louis XIV. of France (who
himself survived a severe dose of variola), five
also died of it in the interval between 1711 and 1774
—viz., his son Louis, the Dauphin of France, in
April of 1711; Louis, Duke of Burgundy, son of
the preceding, and also Dauphin, and the Dau-
phiness, his wife, in 1712; their son, the Duo de
Bretagne, and Lous XV., the great-grandson of
Louis XIV. Among other royal deaths from
small-pox in the same period were those of Joseph
1., Emperor of Germany, in 1711; Peter 11., Em-
peror of Russia, in 1730; Henry, Prince of Prussia,
1767; Maximilian Joseph, Elector of Bavaria, De-
cember 30, 1777. We thus see that nothing is so
hopelessly bad that a good word cannot be said of
it in some way or another. Even Sir ’Enry Parkes
is spoken of by the Distress as a “ really distin-
guished man!”
It was a grand procession, a suggestive
spectacle, and it is repeated every day of the week.
It never inconveniences the public, and it never
blocks up the streets. It consists of two-wheel
carts, four-wheel carts, light carts, heavy carts,
drays, waggons, and all sorts of conveyances,
moving onwards in the same direction. All heavily
laden, burdened with the products of every coun-
try under the sun ; done up in all sorts of pack-
ages, bales, cases, casks, crates, tierces, tubs, hogs-
heads, bundles, parcels, and boxes ; nailed up,
tied up, stitched up, fastened together in every
conceivable way; of every shape and of every
size. All with the same object in view ; all gra-
vitating towards a common centre, steering a
never-deviating course for the same haven—all
wending their way to where anxious crowds are
waiting—all bound for Anthony Hordern and

It was in Berlin. A biting Baltic breeze
swept through the cheerless streets, piling the
dead leaves in tiny mounds. Those whom business
compelled to be abroad appeared mere animated
masses of warm clothing wobbling through the
bleak thoroughfares. The statesman of the cen-
tury—the puissafft Bismarck—was sick, and as the
weary hours crept by, the attentive watchers by
his bedside saw with sorrow the traces of suffer-
ing In his pale face, marked there the fre-
quent expression of pain which even his iron
will was unable to entirely subdue. “ How
these batrachisn-eating Frenchmen,” he observed,
with some of his old levity, “will rejoice
when they hear of my sufferings. But,” with
fierce energy, “wo may again leave our cards
at Paris without being invited.” The door opened
noiselessly and the Princess stole softly in. In her
band was a yellow-covered book, which had come
by the evening post. It was the “ St. Jacobs Oil
Family Calender” for 1884-5. Seating herself by
her suffering husband’s bed-side, and enjoining
silence by a gesture, she began to read in a low,
distinct tone. The patient’s pinened features re-
laxed, and something like a smile started from his
chin and flickered over his fine, firm face. His
devotsd wife read on. The smile on his face
merged into a laugh, the laugh became a grin, the
grin a guffaw, and a shout of boisterous mirth at
the reading of a laughter-provoking excerpt from
the S. M. Herald threw the famous statesman
into a profuse perspiration, and ended his suffer-
ings. This is true.*

MONEY AND TIME SAVED.
Messrs, thomab henderson and co
Agricultural Machinists, of 89, 91, 95 Eliza-
beth-street North, Melbourne, furnish us with
the following combined statements received from
some of their employes, under date 2«th Januarv
1884 :-Mr. William Downes says : “ With pleasure
1 bear testimony to the efficacy of St. Jacobs Oil
as a household remedy. One application I have
found to totally remove the pain and marks of a
severe bruise, and I believe it to be an invaluable
remedy for sprains. Since experiencing its good
qualities I have recommended it to several friends
for neuralgia, soreness of chest, &c , and in everv
instance it has given iclief.” Mr. w. a. M’Horg
accountant, contributes the following statement •
“ I sprained my ankle very badly. I tried the
efficacy of St. Jacobs Oil. My ankle was greatly
swollen and painful, but after the first application
t*je had sensibly decreased and the feeling
of stiffness entirely gone out of my leg ; in fact
a week’s daily application of the Oil effected a
complete cure, and I had not to remain awav a
tingle day from business. (A friend of mine, after
seeing my ankle, prophesied three weeks’ deten-
tion at home.) I believe the Oil to have great
curative power for sprains, and that it possesses
the properties claimed for it.” Mr. K. W. Johnson
fitter, sprained his ankle severely. He aonlled St*
Jacobs Oil with the most beneficial results. In less
than a week it has made a perfect cure, and he
was not absent from work for a single dav He
has also used it for toothache, which it cured
almost at once. He recommends it to all sufferers.
Mr. John M Intyre, carpenter, in our employ,
speaks of its virtue. ... Having sustained a
severe fall on my back, I was, through the injury
half paralysed, I tried St. Jacobs Oil, and after
using two bottles I found muen relief. My arms
which I could not raise above my head after the
fall, I can now use freely, and can go about my
wbrk as well as ever. I look upon the Oil as a
most valuable medicine, U1 as a

Beaoh and party have invented a new style
of sliding for rowing men. Backsliding.
A. G. Steel’s average against the Austra-
lians this season, up to the time the mail left, was 55
for ten innings.
“ Ulyett,” says an English sporting writer,
“ unfortunately hit several of the colonials while
bowling in the big match.” Humph I
An earnest champion of oockflghting boasts
that he could take one of his cocks and out off
both legs and wings, and the bird would fight then!
Mr. Jeffreson Lowndes resigned the cham-
pionship amateursbip of the Thames, which was
won by Unwin in the race for the Wingfield sculls.
Mr. H. H. Shields, who has won the British
twenty miles amateur bicycle championship, did
the distance in lb. 33min. 30fec., though the ground
was bad.
The Melbourne Sportsman stated last
week that a match was all but fixed up between
Col. Ike Austin, of the flowing locks, and “Pro-
fessor” Payne, who dubs himself the English
“ Champion Fancy Lightning Rifle Shot.”
It is suggested that Courtney, when he
dies, should bo buried “ in four cross-roads, with a
stake in his inside.” It will be the first stake he
ever had a right to, and it should be a satisfaction
to bis spirit to know that even that was obtained
“ on the cross.”
That infallible aquatic authority, the Rum
man, says E. A. Gaden, of the 8.R.C., weighed on
Saturday 20st. 81b. When he stated in a previous
issue that light refreshments would be served out
at the Branch, he must have been misinformed.
The liquor must have been about as heavy as Mr.
Gaden.
The Normanby Bicycle and Tricycle Club
have issued the programme for their first Inter-
colonial meeting, to be held on the 10th November
next. The event of the day will be a three-miles
handicap bicycle race for a first prize of 50 guineas,
and second and third prizes of 35 and 10 guineas
respectively.
By cable we learn the St. Leger Stakes
was run on 10th September at Doncaster, with
the following result:—Mr. Vyner’s The Lambkin 1,
Duke of Westminster s Sandlway 3, Mr. R. Peck's
Superba3. From the latest London papers Superba
ruled first favourite at 5 to 1, Sandlway was quoted
at 100 to 9, and The Lambkin 100 to 8
He was the last man in, and his side wanted
only two runs to win. He was told to be sure and
take a good block. The excitement was Intense.
He measured his distance carefully from the
wicket, and then, holding up his bat, glanced at
the local umpire and said, “ How’s that? ’ “ Out I”
replied that functionary, amidst the cheers of the
locals.
The Burwood footballers succeeded in car-
rying off the Gardiner Cup this season, having lost
only one match— v. Wallaroo—out of eight test
matches. In writing this par. we anticipate the
decision in the disputed match, Burwood v. Uni-
versity; but the Union cannot in justice do other-
wise than give their flat in favour of the Bur-
woods.
When the All-England team beat the
Australians in July, the London Bntb' Acte pub-
lished a cartoon representing the British lion, bat
in band, saying to the Australian kangaroo (whose
face was a caricature of “Spoils” and whose
pouch was filled with “ gate money ”): “Well, you
don’t mind a good licking, so long as you get the
gate-money, do you ?”
It was announced in a London paper of
36th July that Miss Agnes Beckwith would attempt
to swim the English Channel during the second
week in August, and that she would be accom-
panied by Toms, the pilot who bore Captain Webb
company. Miss Beckwith thinks she can swim the
distance in sixteen hours, and as she has ere now
remained in fresh water thirty hours, it is con-
sidered that she should succeed.
A big crowd, including the big-bug visi-
tors, attended the meeting or the Mudgee Tatter-
sail’s Racing Club held In celebration of the Rail-
way opening. Fleetwing defeated Aurora by a
neck for the Opening Handicap ; Wanda carried
off the Ladies’ Bracelet; Little Dick appropriated
Tattersall's Handicap, Fleetwing, half a length
away, second, Casket third; Star made an easy win
of the Prince of Wales Stakes: Councillor won the
Shorts, and Granny finished the day’s sport by de-
feating Wanda for the Terminus Handicap.
It seems Courtney’s excommunication was
a bit of a “ get up,” after all. John Teemer has
written to the American Press, stating he never
authorised anyone to sign his name to the protest,
nor did he know anything of it until he read it in
several publications. He says: “ I never had any-
thing to do with Mr. Courtney, and have no reason
to complain of or protest against him. lam will-
ing to row any oarsman in the world on reasonable
conditions, and bar no one from competing against
me, in either a match Or regatta.”
Tbe “six starters or no race ” was carried
out by the Suburban Bicycle Club on Saturday;
but why this idiotic rule is adhered to is beyond
us, unless it is to block any particular rider who
may have the race well in hand, as was done on
one occasion. The riders who start to make up
the half-dozen merely dash away for ageuple of
laps, or, in some esses, a few vardS, with the
chance of interfering with a bona fide competitor;
and on Saturday one of the “ make-ups ” started
in his shirt sleeves, with a hard black “ masher ” on
his head—a discredit to himself and the committee
who tolerated it.
The Sydney Rowing Club had splendid
weather for their regatta on the Parramatta River
last Saturday. E. P. Simpson won the senior sculls

Edwards, the pedestrian, when seen in
London a tew weeks ago, said he was endeavouring
to arrange terms with Harry Hutchens, the Putney
flyer, to go to Australia and run Malone. Failing
business in that direction, he would return to
America and clinch several offers for good matches.
Edwards remarked, among a variety of other
things, that when in Australia he used to think
that Miller would have a good chance against
Sullivan. But now, having seen Sullivan, he
strongly advises the Victorian, if he is desirous of
taking a trip for the benefit of his health, not to go
near the Boston man’s country.
Mr. Bevill had back luck in his starting at
the Association Ground in Saturday I When trying
to start the second heat of the 150 yards spin, the
P'stol was the difficulty to get off, not the men.
The murderous weapon missed tire a couple of
times, and it was only with the assistance of a by-
stander that Mr. Bevill persuaded it to go off. A
wax match cracked off between a couple of
“gibbers” would be no small improvement on the
tool now in use. But, joking apart, it seems a
funny thing that a revolver and some good ammu-
nition cannot be obtained. It will be remembered
a dispute occurred some time back in connection
with a race started by a snap.
The spirited owner of the Wingadee can-
not witness the running for the Victoria Derby
and the Double Bay Regatta, as the meetings
clash. We deeply sympathise with him, and do
not think the Double Bay Regatta committee
could have had the! best interests of their meeting
at heart when they refused his offer of a ten-
guinea trophy, il they altered the date of their
regatta. However, the skipper of the Wingadee
has not lost all heart just yet of attending the two
events, as we understand he is about to open
negotiations with the V.R.C., with the view of an
alteration of their Derby fixture. What induce-
ment he intends to hold forth has not transpired.
The many colonial friends of Herr Young
Dutchey will be delighted to hoar that he defeated
Mr. Jack Denny, an American gentleman with
pugilistic tendencies, on sth July, at Stockton,
U.S. They will also be pleased to learn that he did
the trick with five-ounce gloves. And this re-
minds us we are in for some lively fistic work in
Sydney. The Victorian authorities put a stopper
on the proposed bout between Farnan and Jackson,
so the men agreed to box in Sydney, Farnan to re-
ceive £35 expenses. The bout is fixed for Monday
next, and, judging by the lead obtained by Jackson
in the early part of their first set-to, we should not
be surprised, should the Sydney man keep his wits
about him, in seeing him sing a gentle lullaby to
the Cabbage-Garden masher.
The Canterbury Park Race Club held a
meeting on Saturday last, but owing to a fatal
accident during the running for the Railway Han-
dicap, the last race was not run off, the various
owners in the event agreeing to hand over the
irize to the unfortunate lad Hanley’s mether.
Fernlea defeated Ellington by some three lengths
for the Spring Stakes, Pirate falling about the spot
Sarabanda afterwards came to grief in the Railway
Handicap. Desmond made an easy win of the
Selling Race; Espeigle defeated Desmond by a
couple of lengths for the September Handicap,
Mars third; and Phyllis won the Railway Handi-
cap, Bonnie Bee second, and Friendship third.
Rounding into the straight, Sarabanda, with Hux-
iey up, fell, and Albert Victor tumbled over her,
killing his rider (John Hanley) on (he spot, Huxley
escaping with a shaking. This race brought the
meeting to a gloomy termination.
A smart idea of Mr. Watson’s for tbe pub-
lic to subscribe £5OO for Hanlan and Beach to row
for. We don’t suppose, though, the public will
see it in quite the same light as Mr. Watson, And,
by the way, Harry Hutchens, of Putney, champion
sprinter of the world, has offered to run anybody—
it does not matter who—from 50 yards to 410 for a
trophy or a staae. Can’t we raise a paltry £5OO
for the purpose of backing Malone against him ?
We really think Mr. Watson should take this
matter in hand, just to uphold the “ honour of the
colony," for we never knew that Mr. Watson was
more Intimately acquainted with] aquatics than
pedestrianism till Hanlan’s advent in the colonies.
And, en pawant, it is wonderful the orators who
have been brought prominently into notice over
the wrangle about the aquatic championship—men
who previously were never heard of in the boating
world. But talk is cheap, and a vastly different
matter to planking a portion of tbe £5OO proposed
by Mr. Watson. When that comes on the board,
we think the majority of them will “ pass."
Tbe career of Bt. Gatien, wbo divided tbe
Derby, after a dead heat with Harvester, affords a
remarkable illustration of the vicissitudes of a
race-horse. In addition to doubtful and un-
fashionable parentage, he was such a mean, com-
mon-looking yearling, that his breeder ordered his
trainer to sell the colt by auction during one of
the autumn meetings at Newmarket, soon after
he was broken. The colt had previously been
offered for sale privately, at £lOO, to several people
at Newmarket, including Hayhoe (Mr. Rothschild’s
trainer), who consented to take the yo mgster in
liquidation of an account of £5O, bat declined to
give “century.” As Sherwood had only two or
three horses at the time, he consented to train the
colt at 30s. per week, Instead of the standard charge
of 505., on condition that Major Bruce made it up
to him if St. Gatlen turned out well. He won All
the three races tor which he started at two-year-
olds, and as his owner continued anxloui to sell,
St. Gatlen was purchased by Mr. Hammond for
£14,000 during the winter, with the contingency ot
another thousand if be turned up trumps.
We have often drawn attention to the
falling off in the physique of the rowing men of
to-day, from the Garvans, Clarks, Crooks, Parks,
and others too numerous to mention, ot days gone
by, but, bad as the comparison is, the rowing men
of the day show out, at all events In the upper
works, just as boldly over the average run of ouf
bicyclists; and the inference naturally draws it-
self that the bicycle develops the lower limbs at
the expense of the all-important chest, arms, and
shoulders. On Saturday we were struck with the
appearance of nearly all the wheelmen. Legs of
an abnormal size to the sunken chest, lemonade
shoulders, and arms that the average girl Would he
ashamed to show without a covering. What fine
men there were could be counted bn Out fingers,
and in nearly every case they had at one tlmb or
another gone in for so me other one on
the water, that one In the football ot cticket field,
and so on through the fe\t well-fotmed ones, al-
most without an exception. For a sbt man it may
not be so bad, but fot an unfotmed yolingster to
be bent nearly double-, with all the work codling
on the lower limbs, we maintain-, must be most
injurious; and we do no think the bicycle, In place
of the bar, the boat, on the football field, will ne
the moans of raising the coming generation, In
point of physique, to the standard of the past.
The so-called intercolonial liieeting of the
Suburban Bicycle Club, held on the Association
Ground on Saturday last, was a Snare ana a delu-
sion, and the Suburbans cannot ooiUplain if their
future meetings are looked upon with distrust by
the general pub'lp. Counter attractions in every
direction no doubt had a great effect on the attend-
ance, and we venture to say the stiff and ridicu-
lous charge of a shilling at the gate bad no small
say in the limited number on the ground. If
Smifkins likes to take his girl and her new Spring
turnout on to the lawn, let him pay for the luxury
by all means; but, in our humble opinion, six-
pence is ample for a long-suffering public to
“ part ’’ for admission to a portion of their own
domain. However, we suppose this sort of thing
will go on till the athletic clubs raise a ground of
their own, when we fancy the bar-rooms, billiard-
tables, and highly-paid secretaries will have to
undergo a little retrenchment. C. W, Bennett
won tbe five miles Intercolonial Challenge Gup
as be liked. Wood second, and Thurlow third; and
the Champion also appropriated the mile ;tricycle
race from scratch; H. M. Evans carried off the
three-mile Club championship; W. H. Chapman,
60 yards, won the mile maiden handicap. The 150
yards spin resulted in a win for G. F. Williamson,
9 yards; W. H. Chapman, 170 yards, annexed the
mile open handicap; A. Edwards won the mile
without handles from scratch; B. Henry GO
defeated Lenane (4 yards) for the 300 yards flat
race handicap; and G. T. Allwood pulled his fair
nominator through for tbe two miles ladies' nomi-
nation.
We notice Mr. Deeble poses in his famous
letter to the Noozb as the “Guardian of the
Champion," but it strikes us if the Beach back-
sliding be a specimen of bow he intends to carry
out his guardianship, the sooner Beach moves on
his own hook, or Clifford beats him, the sooner we
shall have a Champion who is prepared to hold the
title without calling in the aid of a lawyer to
clench matters, so that no loophole is left for com-
petitors for the proud affix of “ Champion of the
Universe ” to crawl out of after pledging their
word to row on a certain date. It is only going
over old ground to say that Mr. Deeble, at the
meeting when the match was fixed up for May,
went out of the room and returned with Beach,
when the Champion stated bis willingness to row
on the date named; but from the haggling about
the deposit money, and the humiliating amount
insisted on by the Beach party, it would seem they
had an idea of drawing out if tbe match did not
suit them, articles or no articles. And when Mr.
Watson proposed that a Nautical Almanac should
be obtained to settle disputes about the tide, Mr.
Deeble was most emphatic in stating the matter
should be settled then and there, or no match
would bo made. Beach was the first to state be
would not be bound down not to row in the mean-
time; and had it not been for bis broaching the
“ soft £5OO "—which, by the way, we do not think
he will find quite such a “soft” affair—we feel
confident Hanlan would never have given a se-
cond match a thought. Beach was perfectly jus-
tified, before pledging himself to row in May,
to insist on his six months' grace, though it looked
to outsiders like a case of “funk;”as we daresay
ninety-nine per cent, of people out of the colony,
after reading the little episode re the Tomki, be-
lieved he won it on a fiuke. However, having
passed his word, he should have stuck to it, articles
or no articles. While the straightgoing manner in
which ho refused to row on the Nepean was fresh
in the minds of the general public, he had the
sympathy of the crowd with him, and the alleged
manner in which Trlckett had to chase the Cana-
dian about for a second match was another great
point in his favour; but since bis, or, rather, his
banker's, backsliding, Hanlan stands forth in h n u
relief as the Injured Individual. Under the h..
cumstances of the big subscription proposed to ha
raised for Beach, we fancy he wotlldf have dona
well to remain the. idol of the masses till the
‘ sugar ” had rolled in. It is hard lines for tha
Champion to be in the hands of such bad adf iaebn-
as we don’t suppose he had any, ihote to do winl
the backsliding than the Kiama Ghost; but wb ark
sadly afraid Beach will hud the subscription li«?
a great deal affected by the change of clroura.

Tom Huggins runs a whisky-mill at
Bourke. Nothing particularly interesting In that
you will say; plenty of those kind of people right
through the country. Well, so there are; but
they re not all like Tom Huggins, and that’s whv
we want to tell you about him. You see, he’s a
very easy-going sort of galoot, quiet and unas-
suming, and as harmless as a mad dog. It’s not all
beer and skittles running a hotel in a country
town, either, especially in the North-west. The
customers are sometimes too frisky to be pleasant,
and have a playful habit of wanting to wade in
gore—a propensity which, if not checked, is liable
to run riot with the feelings of those unsophisti-
cated children of the back-blocks, and is calcu-
lated to cause a lot of trouble. Well, once upon a
time, one of the roaring “ ringers ” of a shearing
shed was on a bit of a bender at Bourke, and when
he bad hoisted in a plentiful supply of snake-juice
he started round to find some foeman worthy of
his steel—one that could stand up long enough to
be knocked down comfortably, a man that could
take a lot of belting. “ None of your crawlers
for me,” he would cheerfully remark, “ but a regu-
lar ring-tailed roarer that can hit like a entire "
So he strolled down to Tom’s hostelrle, had another
turn at the fighting rum-cask, and then started to
look up a row. He heard Incidentally In the bar
that the landlord could “slog” a bit, and he In-
wardly resolved that he’d give him a turn. And
then ho proceeded on a regular tear round, mak-
ing things lively for the bar bummers, so that
Huggins had to put In an appearance to calm
things down a bit. “ Oh, you’re the bloomin’ man
thatlwantl” yelled the shearer; “ you’re a smart
to stop this kind of fun, ain’t you ? I’ll soon
fix you up; so put up your props.” “Don’t be a
fool,” rejoined Huggins; “you’ll only get into
trouble by kicking up a row here, so I’d advise
you to leave It alone.” “No bloomin’ fear ot me/’
retorted the bushman; “ I’ll look out for that, and
have plenty of sleep, and I’mgoing to knock the
knobs off you, old sort.” “ Well, if you’ve set
your mind on doing so,” coolly remarked Tom, “|
suppose you must have your way; but, you see, if
we get slogging each other here, it’ll ruin mV
business and the ‘traps’ will be down on us
besides. Now, I’ll tell you what I’ll do; I’ll
put the horses in the buggy, and we'll drive
out a few miles in the bush, where he can
have a good quiet time, free from interference or
interruption/’ This arrangement didn’t quite suit
the shearer, but finally he assented, and the pal**
drove! gaily away, to the extreme disgust of the
onlookers who considered themselves badly used
In the affair. Tom’s confident and cool demeanor
during the drive was not at all reassuring to his
belligerent companion, who began to think that
he hadn’t got such a good thing in hand after all
So when they arrived at the convincing ground
Huggins jumped out of the buggy, and was busy
securing the horses, when his opponent thinking
that Tom would be easier to tackle after getting- a
lick of a spare splinter-bar under the ear, pro-,
needed to put his thoughts into execution, finding
the weapon at hand in the buggy. But Huggins
saw the move, and in Jees time than vou could
count, he landed the back-blocker one “ under the
jaw,” that made him see several particular de-
scriptions of stars, which he followed up by a series
of hard hits that had a very damaging effect on
the frontispiece of his opponent. When the fun
was over (it didn’t last long, by the way), the
shearer looked as though he had accidently fallen
into a threshing machine with a powerful steam
engine at the other end of it in full swing and
when they returned to the city in the buggy, hia
face was so artistically decorated in colours that
his mates had some difficulty in recognising their
erstwhile boon companion. Since then, whenever
the noble bushmen want “ divarshun ” thev don’t
look up Tom Huggins for it.
VALUABLE SUGGESTION FOR UTILISING THE PRESENT EXTREMELY GRACEFUL
FASHION.


A PRETTY PACK.
What is more to be desired by a young lady than
a beautiful, clear complexion? She may have
wealth, education, and all the accomplishments
which will fit her to be an ornament to society
but if she have a sallow countenance, and her face
be covered with pimples. It will avail but little.
Let her remove the cause of all this disfigurement
by the use of Emil Frese’s Hamburg Tea, and our
word for it she will soon find her beauty fully

Political Points
The Tory newspaper Press held a conven-
tion the other day In London. One of the editors
nresent asked the leaders of the Conservative
narty, who were present, what could be done in
the way of subsidising the party's organs, as there
wa g not a large demand for Conservative news-
papers. This matter was, of course, not alluded
to by the Tory prints, but the London Echo got
hold of it, and made immense capital out of the
incident.
Parnell says that five bills relating exclu-
sively to Ireland have been rejected during the
present Parliament by the House of Lords. The
London Echo remarks that “ the Peers never pass
an Irish measure willingly, unless It be a Coercion
gill: then they are never backward. Nearly every
year since the Union they have passed a Coercion
Xct. Between the years 1880-80 they passed forty-
eight of these Acts. In some years they passed
two or three. They have been as active in sanc-
tioning coercive legislation as in rejecting every
measure intended to correct abuses.”
The London correspondent of the York-
shire Post writes:—" The condition of the House
of Commons is at present simply disgraceful.
Practically the Irish members have taken posses-
sion of it, and they keep the House sitting until
3, 4, and 5 o’clock every morning in order that they
may malign as many public servants as possible,
and prevent the voting of any money.” Granny
should certainly engage the Yorkshire Postf’s
London correspondent to supply her columns with
a monthly screed. He Is evidently a Jingoistic
fraud after her own heart. One weuld have
thought that honest Englishmen would have felt
a deep sense of gratitude to those Irishmen who
against Bureaucratic influence had wrought suc-
cessfully to secure a purification of the British
Civil Service. But the Yorkshire pudding-head
can only see a maligning of public servants in an
exposure of catamites, and Granjiy endorses his
view.
Paris Figaro makes a sensational proposal,
to the effect that France and Germany should
shake hands, and make common cause against
England. It is not long since the KRbuz Zeitung
suggested that all the nations of the Continent
should band themselves together, under the hege-
nomy of Germany, to combat the growing pre-
dominance of Great Britain all over the world.
The Cologne Gazette says: “In academic dis
oussions amongst us, there is perfect agreement
that a Franco-German alliance, open, honest, and
above-board, would be an Ideal state of which we
are only wont to dream in especially beautiful
dreams. A Franco-German alliance would mean,
for both nations, security against all attacks what-
soever, and, if we liked, mastery of the whole
world Nothing would be hailed la Germany with
greater jo / Shan an alliance with our old foes.”
Yet England has been absolutely suckling these
Germans. There can be no alliance between
Prance and Germany until the generation which
remembers Sedan has passed away.
Japan can now sing cheerily after the
noble words of Johnny Manners,
“Let arts and learning, laws and science die,
We’ve got once more our old nobility.”
Yes, the Government of Japan has just issued a
notification rehabilitating the nobility. At the
Restoration, over a decade ago, the whole body of
nobles were theoretically extinguished; they were
deprived of their titles, and became commoners—
wealthy ones in most instances. This state of
affairs has now been altered. Th ere are again to
be princes, marquises, counts, viscounts and
barons among the Japanese. The following is a
portion of the imperial rescript:--“The high-born
descendants of illustrious ancestors, who have
achieved great and noble deeds, are the lustre of
the State, and I recognise that; It is fitting that
especial honour should be confet red upon them, in
token of the consideration In wlaloh I hold them.
It is no less fitting, that part Icular honour be
shown to those civil and mil hairy officers who
signalized themselves while supi porting me in the
restoration of my rule, and th at similar distinc-
tions be conferred upon them Ukewise. [Here is
the raison d'itre of the retrogressive move.] For
these reasons, I hereby decree the establishment
of Five Orders of Nobility in my Empire, that I
may manifest my recognition (if eminent services
to the State.”
Thus Professor Thorold. Rogers on the
House of Lords:—” The Lords, have never on one
occasion when the country iras unanimous ever
vindicated public liberty or taken guarantees
against arbitrary government» but have almost in-
variably been timid in the de fence of public right,
though eaver and unscrupulous in maintaining
and enlarging the privileges of their own order.
. . . The most cherished p rivileges of the peer-
age, their incontestable rigl it to a writ of sum-
mons, the heritable character of a writ of summons,
the incapacity to surrender a peerage, are self-
assertions unwarranted by positive law and con-
tradicted by numerous prt icedents. . . . The
traditions of the English peurage are every way
disastrous. The order is protected against its own
vices by secret and misol ilevous conveyances
which often give an appear ince of opulence to
members of the body, who are all the while im-
poverished, and who general Jon after generation
defraud their creditors. Th e existence, even in a
moderate degree, of a panpe r section in the House
would be a serious scandal, and, in consequence,
families are bolstered upbyi irlvate Acts of Parlia-
ment, and even by sinecui e offices, . , . The
institutions which protect Er glish nobles assist the
survival of the unflttest. . - . They have never
helped to bring the English people out of Egypt
and tho house of bondage, and he would be a very
false priest. Indeed, who ascribed such a mission
and such u function to thw golden calf of the
English race. . . . The Cabinet is not only the
best second chamber devisable, but the only se-
cond chamber which is necessary.”
Since Graham Berry laid the foundation
atone of a new Harmy “barracks,” weird and
wonderful rumours have been floating about the
political atmosphere of Melbourne. Not to keep
you longer in suspense, then, the name of Balling-
ton Booth is bruited abroad as the coming Premier
of Victoria. No one knows exactly how the thing
is to b 3 managed, but the general notion is that the
Loard will bring about a dissolution of the present
Ministry, and that the Harmy vote—which, at the
rate Salvation is spreading in Victoria, may be
expected to comprise two-thirds of the roll at the
next general election—will be reserved for sup-
porters of a Booth-Berry coalition. Anyway, a
catastrophe is hanging over the Cabbage Garden.
Service deals in whisky, and Graham has taken to
dealing in Salvation. Well, the two won’t mix at
all, at all. Booth distinctly states that the dearest
desire of the Harmy (next to gathering In the
pieces) is to destroy the devil’s agent, “ Drink,”
and as Graham states that “ the army will, while
working on the present lines, always have his sup-
port,” people are justified in anticipating a speedy
split, and looking hopefully for a Hallelujah
Cabinet. No man can serve two masters; there-
fore, as the Chief Secretary has given his support
to the Loard, and the Loard has (presumably) in-
formed Booth of his objection to wine merchants,
Graham &• d his colleague must part company for
I ever. Tbat’6 sound logic enough. Then the ques-
tion arises as to which of the twain shall still grip
the reins of office, and defy the French. The
Harmy vote will decide that question, and it’s good
long odds that before the year is out every sitting
of the Victorian Legislature will be inaugurated
by a “knee-drill.” Shout Hallelujah!
In the chapter on “The management of
Land and of Capital,” in Mommsen’s “ History of
Rome,” you will find these words—words which,
it seems to us, are pregnant with suggestions and
warnings for Austialian politicians:—” The whole
system was pervaded by the utterly unscrupulous
spirit characteristic of the power of capital. . . .
Pastoral husbandry was practised on a far greater
scale than agriculture. . . . When tho small
holdings ceased to yield any substantial clear re-
turn, and the farmers were irretrievably ruined, it
was merely a question of time how rapidly the
lands of the Italian farmers would come to be
merged in the larger properties. . . . Special
circumstances tended to favour the growth of
pastoral husbandry as contrasted with agriculture,
although the former was far more injurious to the
State. An estate under cultivation, while not
demanding the presence of the master constantly,
required nis frequent appearance on the spot,
whereas an estate under pasture admitted of un-
limited enlargement, and claimed little of the
owner’s attention. The growth of pastoral hus-
bandry was favoured also by the occupation of
the domain land: as the portions so occupied
were ordinarily large, the system gave rise
almost exclusively to great estates. ....
Industrial art remained comparatively unde-
Iveloped. . . . The spirit of the capitalist pene-
trated and pervaded all stations, and the Govern-
ment began to become one of the enterprises of cap-
italists. . . . Civil equality suffered a severe blow
In consequence of the line of social demarcation
becoming more and more distinctly drawn be-
tween the rich and poor. Nothing more effectu-
ally promoted this separation in a downward
direction than the rule that it was disgraceful to
take money for public work. . . Industrial art,
which ought to have held the highest place, In
fact occupied the lowest. Commerce flourished,
but it was non-reciprocal. . . The deep-rooted
immorality, which is Inherent in an economy of
pure capital, ate into the heart of society and of
the commonwealth, and substituted an absolute

a Roman senator possessed four such estates as

supported from 100 to 150 farmers’ families was
now occupied by one family and about 50 for the
most part unmarried slaves,” &c.

An exceedingly neat programme was
Issued by the Suburban Bicycle Olub for their
meeting last Saturday, and the entries gave some
Ideally capital racing. Although wheel races are
Very popular, there have been a good many of
them ateiy, and the lovely weather and other at-
tractions drew pleasure-seekers In all directions
so the gathering on the Association Ground was
not a crowded one. But the afternoon’s sport was
good, the bracing breeze made parading on the
lawn almost a necessity, and there was a gay and
variegated show of toilets; the Cityl'Band, more-
over, under Mr. Hodge, again appeared in public,
and, in the corner opposite the entrance gate,
played a list of eight choice selections, all soft and
tuneful strains. At two o’clock, the novice riders
started in the “maiden mile,” and, at live, a
finish was made with the “ladies’ nomination,”
a novelty, inasmuch as the prizes are three brace-
lets, which the winners are no doubt expected to
present to somebody who can fitly wear them.
The lucky winners were all Suburban men, Att-
wood, Kornshard and C. K. Wood. Indeed, it is
notable that, with one exception, the winner of
every ’cycle race on Saturday belonged to that
flourishing club. They showed up 29 strong in
the parade, other clubs being poorly represented.
Ladies, as usual, watched the .events keenly, and
even it some of their criticisms were very inno-
cent, they showed at least what interest was taken.
It was quite touching sometimes to listen to the
exclamations of delight as fair spectators would
follow up some well-known name in an exciting
race, lavishing an almost affectionate amount of
sympathy upon him, and then discover at last
they had been watching the wrong man. Ladies
are on safer ground when watching and cri-
ticising one another. One of their most fre-
quent objects of criticism, perhaps, was a silk
dress of remarkable colour. In some lights it
looked a terra-cotta of dazzling brightness, in
others l a copper colour; but it was most sugges-
tive of that full, rich brown seen in the nasturtium
flower; the skirt was pleated and bunched, and
the breast covered with ficelle lace. There were
suede gloves, and It was the most conspicuous
dress. A perfect antithesis to its glowing warmth
was a dress of faint bluey-wbdte, made In simple
percale, but most tasteful in fit and style, with a
red border to show under its white lace hem. A
heliotrope, spotted with vlok't, and with violet
loops of ribbon at the bottom, looked nice on a
sprightly little lady. The two linest dresses were
both of velvet, with silk sash round the hips; one
was myrtle-green, the other ruby. The gayest
was a bright moss-green skirt of velvet, sur-
mounted with cream striped silk body and paniers
The prettiest were worn by two sisters, but they
only favoured admiring eyes wiith a brief glance
as they went into the stand. On e was pure white
lawn, everything to correspond, and the dazzling
parasol was edged with a filmy lace like falling
snow. The other was of lightest I’awn, exquisitely
airy, and passed out of vision so q uickly as only to
leave a faint idea of what was the prettiest picture
of the afternoon.

At the Girilambone bachel ors and bene-
dicts’ ball, which came off on t he sth inst., the
vitality and energy of the back -blockers, espe-
cially the Byerock contingent, rm ide a grand suc-
cess. Arrangements and decorations, thanks to
the ladies’ help, were first-class. . ibout 30 couples
attended, and the dresses, which nearly all came
from Sydney, were alike a wonder ful mystery and
a vision of beauty to the men “ who roam the
mvall scrub and mulga downs, the swamp and
salt-bush plain.” Opinion was very much divided
as to the belle; several of the N ever-Never men
swearing that they were all belles. But the imagi-
nation is apt to get heated by b jng residence op
those thirsty plains, and colder c ritics could look
at the girls more impartially. T hose who could
keep calm enough to look steadily, thought the
honour lay between a graceful gi xl in pink and a
lively one in a short blue dress—b otk being good
dancers-and a tall, good-looking, but rather sta-
tuesque young lady in white sati n. Apart from
these three attractions, other nic e toilettes wer
worn; a blue and brown brocaded silk, worn by a
dark and stately married lady; a pale pink, on
tall maiden, and a canary satin ' vorn by a dar c
young lady, were most striking. This ball, th
most enjoyable and successful ever held on th
West Bogan, did not break up till t he kookaburras
with their noisy notes, heralded th» s broad daylight!
* * *■
Another bachelors’ assembly on Friday in
Needs’s rooms proved as satisfactory as they al
ways do. There was a chceiful company, plenty
of room, good music, and a tastefully-laid supper
table without any crush. The coolness of the
night led to the conservatory abvays being full
and the ballroom showed the coi itinual a litter o;'
beautiful costumes. Beaded whites and modest
pinks, lace-edged blues, and car dinals bedecked
with pompons, lace, and fringe, w ere all excellent
as with beaming eyes and flitting 1 eet their wearers
flashed around. Nearly all were skilful dancers
none more so than a lively lady l a a quiet dross of
cocoa-coloured veiling, with maroon velvet bodlct
and bands. Some score of da aces were done
Messrs. Baylis and Shortland bei pg masters of the
floor; and soon after 12 o’clocik, the assembly
close i. Next month’s dance will, close the season
* * *
A fairly large audience—mostly a front-
seat one—met in the now Masonic Hall on Thurs-
day, when a high-class concert wtis given, in aid
of the new building for ophthalmic children,
Miller’s Point. The programme was of reasonable
length, but several encores were insisted on,
especially when Miss Annls Montague sang Meyer-
beer’s “Ombra Leggiera” (encore. “Kathleen
Mavourneen ”), and Rossini’s “Bel Raggio” (en-
core, “Somebody’s coming”), each piece gaining
loud and long applause. This lady also sang in
two duets with Mr. Charles Turner, and the latter
sang “The last watch,” and “ Her name.” Madame
Marius, Herr Francik. and four gentlemen ama-
teurs, who sang twice in quartettes, assisted in the
programme, Madame King being accompanist.
Mrs. Moulton, who has taken an interest in the
ophthalmic institute, made her ddbut in public
very successfully, singing first the simple ballad,
“Auntie,” and then “Close to the threshold,”
with accompaniment of Francik’p violin, and [a
number of handsome bouquets were sent to her
at the finish of each song. The Governor, Lady
Loftus, and a party from Government House were
present at the concert.
• • m
In the new Masonic Hall, on the 10th in-
stant, Sydney Owls held their usual monthly hoot.
Punctuality is not a virtue of all the members,
and 8 o’clock had long gone before some of the
tardy ones came. Mr. C. Shepherd prevailed a
good deal at the piano, and the best song of the
evening was “ It was a dream,” by Mr. Brooks, the
most amusing beina “The good young man who
died.” The musical efforts of the Owls were not
all of even merit, but the audience proved con-
siderate. Young aspirants could not have a
better chance to make a first appearance than at
one of these meetings where the social Owls
smoke their cigars, “wet their beaks.” and listen
not too critically to maiden efforts. “The Anchor’s
Weighed,” “The Shipwrecked Crew.jltfl a medley
of comic songs were among the sqßEor pieces
given. At half-time, there was an inliWal, during
which the Owls disappeared below the platform,
and came up soon after looking much fresher.
• • •
On Friday last, a private social of a most
genuine and enjoyable kind was held in the Town
Hall, Petersham. About 40 couples were present,
and the room was brilliant with handsome toilettes
Conspicuous amongst them, were those of two
sisters from Summer Hill, the elder in white, with
pale blue brochd front, and the younger in a beau-
tlful dross of pure white. A young 1 lady, resident
in the locality, was well-arrayed In a delicate pink
satin, and attracted much admiration, as did also a
young- lady from Newtown, in a very neat cream
dress, set off with pale blue front. About mid-
night, there was a pause for refreshments, after
which dancing was renewed, till the small hours
brought the close of a very pleasant festive
gathering.
• * ♦
At St. Michael’s, Surry Hills, on the 10th
instant, Miss Helen Friend Brownlow, a younger
daughter of Mrs. Brownlow, ef Gowrie, Waverley,
was married to Mr. A. B. Clark, surveyor, of Mel-
bourne. The bride wore a pearl satin train and
body, with skirt of beautiful old honiton lace, veil
t , mat °h, and wreath of orange blossoms. Two
sisters, as bridesmaids, wore white cashmere
dresses with mauve sash, and white chip hats with
mauve feathers. The bride’s mother wore a rich
black silk dress with train, and cream bonnet and
feathers; and two elder sisters looked cool and
summery in white lawn skirts very full, and
tucked into the waist; hats with complete garden
of Soring flowers-in fact, a kind of wo-manly
flower show. The bride and bridegroom left for
Melbourne by express train.
• • •
There is some beauty in wild flowers; but
the gush about them is just a trifle overdone.
Many of the extravagant eulogies passed at the
Manly wild flower show were probably uttered by
persons who "speak from the teeth outwards”;
those who were in earnest cannot have travelled
much. Certainly, there was something to admire;
but it was the Industry and ingenuity of those
who put the flowers together, rather than the
dingy products of our suburban scrub. The
amount of labour expended was enormous. A
l emery atone end of the pavilion leading to en-
closed grounds was a fairy-like scene, a home fit
tor the fays of Shakespeare’s fertile fancy, a
miniature gully with cascade of babbling water
casting crystal spray upon the cool green ferns.
Mrs. J ■ Ilardie did a large trade at her stall. Mrs.
C. H. Hayes had some of the best devices. Mrs.
Smedley s Japanese stall was of the most original
kind, one of its items being a peacock composed of
tposs, with natural feathers. A novelty was a
doll s house in swamp grass, finished off with
native roses. The prima donna stallholder. Miss
roote, was very attractive in a costume of dark
chocolate body and white skirt, with white bows.
Next, were the Misses Olley, one in pink, one in
blue; and, indeed, all the stallholders, however
careful of the flowers, had not omitted to bestow
a little care on their own fair selves. Among the
visitors, a most distinguished costume was worn
by a Melbourne lady—dark green velvet and car-
dinal, and a green satin skirt to match. A very
noticeable costume was grey satin and bonnet
with pink feathers, in excellent taste. Shot fabrics
wore plentiful, and a dark lavender dress with
body of shot plush was very prominent. On
Ihursuay, the attendance was fashionable. Sir
Alfred Stephen opening the show, and the faces of
known society people were seen on all sides.
Saturday was the popular day, when there was a
terrible crush, and very insufficient accommoda-
tion in any respect. Music was provided by a
. n d ? a V h da 7v and Q uon S Tart furnished that
stall of his which is now always looked for by the
public. In the evening of Saturday the show was
open, and there was a late boat back to Sydney,
which would have been a great convenience if It
had been put on the two previous days.;

Next Wednesday, the grand Masonic ball
of the Lodge Sydney Tarbolton, 377 8.C., takes
place in the Town Hall, and is sure to be pleasant,
as the balls of this Lodge always are. Everyone
knows how suitable the vestibule is for a large
ball, every convenience being provided, and the
promoters are determined to have a thoroughly
sociable affair. Dancing begins at 8 30.

Christ Church, Queanbeyan, was the scene
of a pretty wedding last Thursday, the bridegroom
being Mr. James Morrice, of Marulan, and the
bride, who looked nice in pale India muslin and
lace. Miss Charlotte Kemp, of Queanbeyan. Two
bridesmaids in pink, and two in blue, looked
prettily stylish. Mrs. Kemp wore a handsome
black broche, and the bridegroom looked as solemn
as happy man always does on such occasions. The
choir aided the service, and the church was well
decorated, A dance was given in the evening by
Mrs. Kemp, in the Protestant Hall. Conspicuous
among the guests was the local member’s wife, in
a handsome cream satin; also, the wife of the P.M.,
in cream broche. The banks were represented by
a stately lady in black, and a petite in handsome
cream broche. The charming bridesmaids soon
had full programmes. A surveyor’s wife looked
well in cream, and her dancing was much admired.
Two sisters from a neighbouring station la pink
and blue, a bank manager's daughter in mauve,
and a young lady in black and cardinal, were at-
tractive. A stylish dress of white satin, hand-
painted, was worn by a merry girl who danced
indefatigably: ana a young lady from Canberra in
pink, as well as one in white from Cuppacumba-
long, were admirable. The bachelors mustered in
great force; and though a public hall does not
afford many opportunities for that dalliance so
dear to youthful hearts, yet there were a few
couples on whom the mystic influence of the beau-
tiful morning service seemed to have had a serious
effect.

A ball will be given by the Mayor and
Mayoress of Sydney on the 15th October, in the
Town Hall.
• • •
The Vaudeville Quadrille Club gave a plain
and fancy dress ball on Friday evening, the 13th
instant, and great was the merry-making thereat.
Some thirty or forty couples paraded the hall in
motley hue—one's sensation being the usual doubt
as to whether time had slipped back a couple of
hundred years or more, or whether we were some-
body else and had been living all our lives as
supe ’’ in an opora-bouffe company. Various
were the characters and marvellous the effects
produced by fair young ladies and brave men.
Foily, with twinkling test and tinkling bells, co-
quetted with the King of Spades, whose gloomy ex-
terior was a good disguise for the jolly good fellow
ne turned out to be. A muscular Mephistopheles,
whose get-up was a success, succumbed completely
to the fascinations of the gentle sex. A charming
little lady from Hurry Hills appeared as Vaude-
ville, in red and black satin spangled with golden
crescents. Mary Queen of Scots, who, in regal
fashion, did not choose to give the entertainment
too much of her presence, looked stately in a weli-
composed robe of black velvet and white satin. A
pretty costume was that of the Scotch Lassie
whose face harmonised well with its agreeable
surroundings. Many other effective costumes
could be mentioned, whose attractive wearers
came in for their full share of admiration.
Among the ladies who elected to appear iu even-
ing dress, Miss Hill took a first place, in a most be-
coming costume of white satin trimmed with rose-
buds. Miss Stephens looked well in blue and
white muslin. Mr. Maddison, as a Captain in the
Blue Ribbon Army, was none the less a good
fellow because its leading principle was quietly
forgotten. Mr. Charles, in the part of a Clown,
kept the ball rolling; Mr. Arle decidedly
scored as Bambini: and the Duke, whose
work-a-day name we forget, also took a front
seat. Mr. Seymour as Richard III.; Mr. Carle
as a Jockey; Mr.Griffiths, Yachtsman; Mr. Fowler
Harlequin; Mr. C. Rolleston and Mr. Morris (M.C.)
as Sailors: Mr. Watt, Postillion; and many others
helped in their different parts to heighten the bril-
liancy of the scene, and the whole affair was
creditable to the young people by whom it was
originated. The music was principally provided
by amateur talent of a very superior order. Mr
Callaghan catered successfully. Some 34 dances
were brought to a termination without ajhitch. and
the company, well pleased with the evening's en-
joyment, with the milk in the morning.
The Londoners’ Club ball is announced for
Friday night 19th, In West’s Rooms. This is the
first of what it is hoped to make an annual and
notable festivity, and everything will be done to-
ensure the pleasure of guests. The programme is
to be attacked promptly at 8. Good music is en-
gaged, and if the girls only take care to sit out of
the draught, they can rely on a real nice ball.
Bathurst Buffaloes had a ball in the Vic-
toria Hall last week. About 100 present, Including
Prhno R. Thatcher from Sydney. . .Gundagai
Oddfellows hold their anniversary ball on 19th
September —Some people are displeased that the
Governor of Queensland invited no tradesmen to
his ball. He might have been much more exclu-
sive, and not invited anyone who earned his own
living. The ball would then have been confined to
civil servants and blackfellows On Saturday
week, 27tb instant, the Sydney Amateur Canvas
Oingy Club celebrate the opening of their season
by a little festive flutter at Cremorne. The
Agenoria leaves Fort Macquarie at 3.30, and Mr.
Herbert Downs will see that his visitors spend a
pleasant afternoon Last Monday, another good
gathering of visitors attended the vVoollahra Pri-
vate Rink, and careered around with their usual
energy. So loth are the members to cease, that,
despite the approach of warm nights, there will be
at least one more meeting (next Monday) —The
Bundarra Druids lately had an anniversary concert
and ball. A farce was also played, and the dancing
only ended as dawn came on Next Thursday
there will be a very fashionable affair at the new
Masonic Hall, when a number of distinguished
amateurs are to perform a concert and comedietta
for the benefit of the Infants’ Home, Ashfleld;
tickets, a crown each....On the 25th instant, Sir
Henry Parkes will open a flower-show and bazaar
at Leonards School of Arts, and it will be open the
two following days as well Last Friday there
was a pleasant company at the Balmain Private
Assembly. Mr. Oldham’s refreshments, with good
music and floor, and the efforts of the hon. sec.,
Mr. W. Mitchell, all conduced to enjoyment of a
select company — Burwood, also, had its private
assembly the same night, in the large hall of the
School of Arts, when many handsome toilettes were
seen. Baumann catered.. .Saturday afternoon, 11th
October, Bishop Barry will open the new nave of
St. Thomas’ Church, North Shore, when there will
surely be a crush of fashion, and the daughters of
Moab will be more irresistible than ever Mem-
bers of the Balmain Rowing Club contest, this
Saturday, for prizes given by lady admirers. The
flag-steamer Psyche leaves Erskine-street at 3 p.m.,
and then calls at all Balmain wharves ...Opening
of the Turf Hotel, Bourke, was celebrated by a
supper to some three-score guests, given by Mr.
ormall The fancy fair at Orange was a
brilliant affair; ladies were in fancy costumes,
there were all kinds of sideshows, music, ami large
attendance. The police noted the names of ladies
who raffled articles, so as to prosecute, if neces-
sary. In Sydney church bazaars, raffling is carried
on unchecked. Which shows that law in N.S.W,
is a wonderful thing, depending partly on geo-
graphy, and partly on the density of legal intellect.

In the (Jornhill Magazine for August
appear some gratifying statistics. “As a result of
the general prosperity,” and in no small degree as
a consequence of the shortening of the hours ot
labour, the average duration of life in England
has increased from 39.9 in the male and 41.9 in the
i!wa*o ♦WA w 3u e th ® figures in the period
1838-54) to 41.9 for the male and 43.3 for the female.
Ihe estimate for the whole of life now is that of
one thousand persons—one half males and one half
survive at the age of 45, 36 at 55, nine
at 65, three at (5, and one at 85. Every thousand
persons born since 1870 will live in the aggregate
about 2700 years longer than before.
The Manchester Courier, commenting
upon the pauperism existing* in Sydney (as re-
“ unemployed ” trouble),
thinks that the N.S.W, Government should warn
English working men against going out to a dis-
tant and unknown country with vague expecta-
tions which are not likely to be realised. We can
only see common sense in the Courier’s remarks;
CRANNY, however, says they will cause a smile to
come over the faces of those who recollect the
circumstances alluded to; but, then, the venerable
one, as the organ of capitalist society, naturally
only sees that which is pleasant and gratifying in
anything tending to keep down wages.
The Shen Pao explains that marriage by
capture still exists in China in two forms. One,
reigned capture, concerted by the relatives on
both sides, in order to save expense, and to which
only a feigned resistance is made. Secondly, vio-
lent capture, either on Impulse, or because of
some dispute in the marriage negotiations. In
feigned capture, after three days, the bridegroom
and bride return with a sheepand wine to do obeis-
ance to the bride’s parents. We rather like this
feigned capture idea, with the bride and bride-
groom doing obeisance with sheep and wine to
paterfamilias. It is—we view the matter from the
paterfamilias standpoint—a huge improvement on
the idiotic practice in vogu.e In Britain and its de-
pendencies ot the bride’s father doing obeisance to
her and her man with cake and wine and trim-
mings. Feigned capture, by all means.
Were anything wanting to clinch the too
''veil-known fact of the intensely Jeamesy Jingoism
of the lines on which the (/olonial Institute is run,
the subjoined specimen trom its latest annual
report would do the business straight:—“ The
lamented and premature death of His Royal High-
ness Prince Leopold, Duk e of Albany, evoked the
profound sorrow and heartfelt sympathy of all
Her Majesty s subjects. Jit is well known that His
Royal Highness felt a special interest in the oolo-
nies, and this he evinced!—amongst other ways—
byvlslting the Dominion od Canada, and honouring
with his presence a meeting of the Royal Colonial
Institute which was held a few months ago.
Addresses of condolence with Her Majesty the
Queen, His Royal Hlghmass the Prince of Wales
(president of the Institute j), and Her Royal High-
ness the Duchess of Albany, were adopted on
April 8, and signed by His Grace the Duke of Man-
chester, on behalf of the Council and Fellows.

Mrs, Clement Clay, of Atalanta, Georgia,
was married on July 2nd. On the 10th she insti-
tuted a suit for a divorce. This beats Peter Camp-
bell.
Probably one of the most trying times in a
man’s life is when be introduces his second wife,
seventeen years old, to big eldest daughter, who Is
past twenty.
“That is Miss . She has no parents,
brothers, or sisters, but she is worth £100,000.”
•'AhI that’s just the sort of family I want to
marry into.”
It was the young lady who had just ap-
plied for the situation of cook. "I’vealways been
accustomed to carriage folks,” she demurely said.
And It subsequently transpired that she spoke the
truth, for she was a cabman’s widow.
A photographer says that, at eighteen, a
girl will sit twelve times for a photograph, and
then be dissatisfied. At forty, the same person
will sit once and take the picture even if the
artist points out three or four defects.
A Russian is not legally a man until he is
twenty-six years old. Fancy a Russian mother
saying, “ Alvirawiska, who was that sitting so
close on the sofa with you last night?” and Alvl
replying, “ < niy Chipmunkiwiskl, a little boy
from over the way. We were celebrating his
twenty-fifth birthday.”
None but the brave deserve the fair.—
Lady Circe (who is rather tired, and wants to sit
down): “If you are really so devoted as you say
you are, Sir Charles, I’ll tell you how you can show
your devotion.” Sir Charles: " Tell me I Oh, tell
me I” Lady Circe: “ Well, you can take that nice
old lady down to supper, you know, and then loan
have her chair.”
In England, Mary Nolan, a pugnacious
servant girl, has got two months’ gaol for a brutal
assault on her mistress, the wife of Colonel Basevl.
The assault, which was of an aggravated and de-
termined character, arose from a dispute as to the
personal character of the defendant, and from the
refusal of her mistress to pay the expenses of the
girl’s visit to her mother’s grave in Ireland.
The cholera microbe is in Paris an unwel-
come guest. A French husband, returning to his
domestic hearth, late one evening, observed a sus-
picious hat. Searching further, he found a still
more suspicious gentleman concealed in a cup-
board. " What is the meaning of this?” he asked,
turning with a frown to his wife. “Do not agitate
yourself,” replied the lady, “ the gentleman is only
searching for microbes.”
The horrible crime of mutilating women
by cutting off their noses is so common at Bom-
bay as to call for the free use of the lash. In one
day Judge Scott beard three such oases, in each
of which three years’ imprisonment was inflicted.
The miserable women who are mutilated in this
way are, of course, rendered hideous ever after-
wards; and, because they are women,.it is simply
impossible to calculate the misery and degrada-
tion that they will experience during the rest of
their lives.
In a certain Parisian salon the subject of
conversation was the different methods of suicide.
A learned member of the company recalled the
fact that slaves in olden times strangled them-
selves by swallowing the tongue. “ That is a con-
venient kind of death,” said a lady, "and I would
willingly adopt it in case of necessity.” “Ah I but
that would not be death by strangulation,” mur-
mured one of her friends; “ in your case it would
be death by poisoning.”
She hadn’t made up her mind about it and
they were widely, oh Iso widely separated—in the
drawing-room, from each other; maybe as much
as three feet. There was a pensive silence fringed
with doubt between them. She was engaged in
deep meditation with herself and was looking at
nothing on the floor, when he said: “ Malinda, why
not give me an answer to my proposal ?” “ Why,
I was just thinking how you will look when you
get old,” she thoughtfully replied.
A famous London veterinary surgeon was
the other day summoned by telegram to Scotland
by a well-known lady, to meet the local adviser in
consultation on the case of her He
had to travel nearly 500 miles to reach his destina-
tion. Had a child belonging to a poor neighbour
been dying, the lady dog-owner woulu, of course,
have summoned the most eminent physician from
London. But children are cheaper than pugs in
England-just as, in Sydney, a woman who wants
to run a barrel-organ can hire more cheaply two
babies than one monkey.
in Russia it is a common mode of expres-
sion to say: "As happy as a priests wife.” The
reason why she is so happy is because her hus-
ba id’s position depends upon her. if she dies, he
is deposed, and becomes ameie layman, and bis
Eroperty is taken away from him and distributed,
all to nls children and half to the government.
This dreadful contingency makes the Russian
priest caretul to get a healthy wife if he can, and
makes him take extraordinarily good care of her
after he has secured her. He waits upon her in
the most abject way. She must never get her
feet wet, and she Is petted and put in hot blankets
if she has so much as a cold in the head. It is the
greatest possible good fortune for a girl to marry
a priest-infinitely better than to be the wife of a
noble.
Lawn-tennis is losing its hold on fashion-
able society at home, as a female fad, as there is a
feeling growing that is a game meant for men, and
in which they only have any chance of excelling.
If played by girls, it should be played without cor-
sets. Against a young fellow in flannels, a girl in
stays and a dress weighted with the cumbersome
protuberances which are now in fashion, has no
chance. If she bestirs herself in striking the ball,
her movements are not only ungraceful, but in-
jurious to health, to say nothing of putting her
fashionable fixings considerably out of gear. If,
on the other hand, she doesn’t bestir herself, but
only poses in pretty attitudes, then there is no
game. Besides, there is no opening for sentiment
in tennis: it is too active, and, after all, it is the
men’s company and chatter girls want, not the
game. You never saw four girls playing tennis
without a man.
Miss Helen Taylor, whose active and intel-
ligent services in connection with the Lo don
School Boards and other public matters had won
for her probably a higher standing In public
esteem than any Englishwoman- snee Florence
Nightingale, is sacrificing all her social prestige.
The World says of her that ’she is last losing
any reputation she ever had for political capacity
or jud. ment.” The statement is quite true in the
sense that there can be no reputation except such
as is conferred by the “ swell ” classes. The fact Is
that Miss Taylor has advanced to an earnest ad-
vocacy of the principles of Henry George, and has
become a member of the Council of the Social
IJeroooracy. Consequently, the wealthy and middle
classes—to the latter of which she belongs—have
eeased to applaud, and commence to denounce her.
But, simultaneously, she is acquiring a great and
increasing popularity among the working classes.
In fact, she is already the most respected woman
in England in the eyes of the masses.
London Truth advocates the new Idea of
the “visible corset,’’ as a thing to be desired.
Supposing a neat undergarment to cover the bust
and shoulders, why should the outside corset be
less decent than one which, while it is hidden Itself,
is yet worn beneath a dress which leaves the body
hal nude, as at present? Is there anything lewd
In the sight of corset laces ? Why, they are seen
now on the outside of satin ball dresses. To stout
ladies the new idea would be a positive blessing.
It '8 not their stays which produce that peculiar
bursting appearance in the busts of too, too solid
female Venuses, but the dress Itself, which has the
responsibility of confining that superabundance
which escapes from the stays. There Is no secret
about the duties of a corset. Truth contends that
the visible corset, with a pretty undergarment as
a chemisette (or, as the French so nicely call it,
“une modestie"), would obviate a double squeez-
ing of the vital organs, bring out graceful con-
tours more clearly, and be death to the many
various expedients for improving the figure by
means of Horsehair and wadding. From the toilet
point of view, the visible corset would be like the
nominative case in grammar, and govern the rest
of the costume.
In an article headed “The Peerage on
Loan,” the World waxes cynical at the expense
of "the twenty thousand fashionable people who,
the other day at the Health Exhibition, paid from
ten shillings to a pound apiece for the privilege of
passing a couple of hours under the same roof as
Royalty. A duchess sold butter at a ducal figure,
and a great number of ladies, less highly placed in
the Peerage, were good enough to include them-
selves in the bill of the evening, and disposed of
flowers and fruit at prices which, on other occa-
sions, would have been prohibitive. Everything
was arranged with a precise knowledge of the de-
votion borne by twenty thousand people to a
lord’s relatives even in a week of * demonstration ’
against the Peerage. There was a stall where a
glass of insipid water cost the price of champagne,
and hard by a ‘bar’ where some tolerable beer
could be bought at the same price. But in one case
the dame vendeuse was a duchess; and in the other,
only a young lady, not without personal attrac-
tions, but without a title. All this is delightful.
It is a suggestive circumstance that, on a cold
night, about half the number of people who, two
days before, trudged through the rain to anathe-
matise the Upper House, should crowd the Heal-
theries to prove the awe which the Peerage
inspires. As a matter of fact, there was little to
sec except what had been seen before—for Lord
Charles Beresford and his fishing-pond are getting
a trifle scale—and not much to hear which had not
been often heard on former evenings. But the
Prince and Princess, the two Duchesses, and the
society ladies were irresistible attractions for the
twenty thousand Britons, and accordingly the hos-
pitals will be benefited by their munificence. The
only regret which the organisers of the f£te must
at present experience Is that they did not fix the
tickets at four guineas, and import a batch of the
cheaper German serenities to work the beer-
en/ nea. ’
One of those shows of beauty, splendour,
and fashion in London which some of our
colonial belles would almost sell their crtnolette to
shine in for an hour-was the Health Exhibition.
It was a scene which Payn, illuminator to the
courts of Europe, admitted to be his greatest
triumph. Electricity scintillated everywhere, in
•very conceivable colour and shape, falling upon
cascades of water, flashing from the hearts of
flowers, writing words upon the walls, and turning
lakes of water into sheets of flame. Light dresses,
white shoulders, the jewels, and the aristocracy of
England were all on view to those who liked to
pay. But they had to pay; there was no mercy In
the fleecing. One quiet-looking old gentleman
bought a basket of flowers from the bands of the
Princess of Wales for five guineas, and, on receiv-
ing it and paying, he gave it back on condition she
would have it sold by auction. She agreed, and
the same old party was the buyer for seven
guineas. Paying the money, h« again returned
the basket, with the same odd request. Again
ho bought it, for ten guineas, and was again
returning it to the Princess, when the Prince
of Wales sent his equerry to ask the old
gentleman’s name. That broke the spell: he
declined to give his name and walked away.
Alexandra, as ever, was the figure towards whom
everyone crowded, as she stood, the embodiment
of refined grace, in a plain black grenadine, falling
in folds close to the form, and with a square, low
bodice. Her sole ornaments were magnificent
diamonds, and round her neck there was a tight-
fitting necklet of velvet and diamonds, which bids
fair to become as historical as the cross of Marie
Stuart. Perhaps the next greatest attraction was
the very beautiful, slightly naughty, charming
widow Gladys—known equally as the Gipsy Coun-
tess and Lady Lonsdale. Although now engaged
to be married to Mr. Edward Vincent, the delicate
dudes, like a crowd of mosqnitoes, fluttered thickly
round the celebrated beauty. Roses, usually half
a crown, were eagerly bought from her hands at a
guinea each. Altogether, it was one of those daz-
zling displays seldom seen even in England, per-
haps never equalled outside. And yet, with all its
brilliance, a visitor thus tersely sums up its utter
heartlessness—it was for charity, you know;—" Of
course, we like the hospitals to get plenty of
money; but when we saw all those magnificent
toilettes, those inestimable diamonds, those beau-
tiful women rich beyond even our plebeian
dreams—we couldi not help thinking how much
easier they could have given the money them-
selves than drained it out of others.*
Many parsons, when praying for “those at
sea,” pray for themselves.

A native bear found its way into one of
the wards at the Rockhampton Hospital, the other
day, and before it could be ejected frightened one
of the patients into a fit. Down N.S.W. way, it
would take more than a shipload of native bears
to frighten a patient into a lit—the poor wretch
having painfully acquired a huge stock of endur-

the fire at Boy lson’s mill deserves a notice—he did
it without a single “ devouring element;” the lack
of which, though, be compensated for with a lurid
sprinkling of "ravages of the Are fiend.” and
“ angry mountains of awe-inspiring flames. Still,
the departure from the old track (re the “ d.e.”) is
so meritorious that we have left the price of a
long sleevor for him at our favourite tap.
Wendell Holmes says it is a question
whether the habit of journalism has existed suffi-
ciently long for there to have been time for the
formation of a distinct type of face and manner,
which should be known as that of the journalist.
Other observers, less subtle and more cautious,
have asserted that the ordinary journalist may be
recognised by one infallible test—he may not
always be able to lend yon sixpence, but he can
always oblige you with a lead pencil.
He Was a duly-qualified, legally-ordained
“madglstralt av th’ tirrltory,” and, being invited
to attend a railway opening shivoo, he sent back
a polite note to say he could not attend, as he had
a bad attack of the gout. A few days after this,
the secretary of the demonstration committee
meeting him tramping about as lively as an old
slaughter-house crow hovering round a dead horse
observed, Hedo, Mr. Blank, you oon got over
your gout, Ijnotice.” “Gout! ’ exclaimed the Jay
Pay; Shure, Oi nivir had any gout in me loife
me man. What do you mean ?” said the other-
you yourself made that the excuse for not afcl
tending the railway opening banquet.” “Oh!
now Oi undhersthand fwhat y mane," replied the
s.*fir-tdothefi Fo'on; “but, shure, Oi lent mo
dlckshinary to tu’ praste an’ Oi’d loike t’ see th’
mann that could sphell ‘disayntherry' widout a
dlckshinary.” This jintilmln, by the way, is a
furst cousin, be his muther’s solde,” to the party
who, whilst mooning about the wharves, one day
happened to see a boat with “ Psyche” painted on
th«i side, and at once exclai med “P-s-y-c-h-e
well, be th’ howly frog but that’s th’ funniest
way t sphell ftsh Oi iver heard of.”
When they had failed to lift the old Col-
laroy last week, and shouldered their blocks and
tackle and swore their way back to Manly, a swag-
man took quarters in the cabin, and unrolled his
swag, with the remark that he was in it this time
and proceeded to boil the billy. When the great
stars were shining in the heavens, and the waves
plashed a soothing lullaby against the old ship’s
side, the poor man slept the sleep of fatigue and
bad rum, and dreamt of a land that was fairer than
day, where work la unknown, and the streets run
beer. At midnight he sprang up with glaring eyes
and hair on end. A laugh, as of a thousand
thunders, reverberated from the hills and out to
sea. Peal after peal of laughter shook the old
ship’s sides, “ Ha, ha, ha I wanted to move the old
girl again! Ha, ha, ha! Hold me, somebody I ”
‘ Who are you?” shrieked the swagman, in affright
“Who am I.” said the voice, “I’m the old Col-
laroy, and I’ve got in here on the beach to lie
down and watch the other fools outside battling
the breeze. Ha, ha I Oh I give us a rest. I’m
alive, I’m a ghost, I’m ” “ The devil,” yelled
the swagman, making a bald-headed dart over the
side and away over the hills, and the old original
swagman emerged from the hold, and said, “ That
fixed him. Wonder what he left in his swag!”
Three respectable angels who had agreed
to make a day of it over in the Southern Cross,
stood on the walls of heaven, and having moist-
ened the palms of their hands and given a pre-
liminary flap or two of the wings that dropped
loose silver enough to feed a Kcm man for a year,
plunged headlong down the empyrean chanting a
stave of compensation that reached the dreaming
ears of John Lucas. Arrived at Aloha Gentauri,
they had an hour or two with the bovs, and then
dropped out to pull the upper star of the Cross a
little more straight. When they had caroused on
four-star nectar and sat in bowers of amaranth
with the other jokers until they were getting to
tip their crowns rakishly a-oneside, one said,
“Let’s go down to the selar system, and see how
old Adam’s boys are shaping. Wonder how old
Beelzebub is getting on by this time ?” Once
more they cleave the ether, darting past systems
where the other fellows called “go it, boys,” and
drank their health. They came within sight of
the earth. A globe far off it seemed A little ship
was creeping along the silver-fringed island of the
South. A little man in black walked the deck.
They enter port. Thirty little men come aboard
and read a paper to him. They hear the thirty
little men inform him that heaven was excited
over his arrival, and that they blessed the Al«
mighty for despatching him here. The three
angels stood right over their heads, and a laugh
such as only the everlasting plains could hold
passed from one to another as they mounted the
skies. “ Old Beelzebub is in it yet,” they laughed.
But the little figures heard nothing; and they
didn’t look up.
Another injustice to the worrukin man
At no distant period in the history of this fair anti
favoured colony the leaders of thought among * h e
democracy could hold forth with impunity "in
Hyde Park, and launch their bolts of rhetoric
against their rulers in no measured terms But
the Government of the day, becoming fully alive
to the fact that the Park haranguers were running
the Assembly very close in the matter of ornate
oratory, determined to curtail their field of opera-
tions, and a departmental ukase was issued pro-
hibiting the Park as a hunting Iground for popu-
larity and fame. Then the “ bone and sinew *of ■
the country wended their way to the “ statoo ”
where, beneath the shadow of the mantle of Albert*
the Good, they gave voice to their wrongs in
vigorous, it finelegant, language. But just as:
they fondly imagined that at length they had
found rest for the soles of their number thirteens
and could renew their fulmlnatlons against a
corrupt, emiserable, and effete Government, a
Cabinet consultation was held, and an order issued
to fence in the “ statoo.” So when the next burn-
ing question had to be tackled by the irrepressible
orators they found that “Muster Stooart” had
Stolen a march on them, and that henceforth the
repose of the late Prince Consort would be undis-.
turbed by the gentle cooing of Tlchborne Smith
the rounded periods of the fervid Flower, or the
fierce fulmlnatlons of the impassioned Brown
Then it was that Piower, that disinterested friend
of the worrukin’ man up-ended himself on a
candle-box in the street, and lifted up his voice in
fiery denunciation of the tyrannical Government
that tried to place its iron heel on the neck of the
public. “’Ere we are,” said the Demosthenes of
the labour office, “ driven about from pillar to
post. Why, we’re in no better position now than
the Salvation Harmy, as has to travel about the
streets. But we’ll show the Guv’ment that we’ll
bo heard, fur we’ll go down to the ’Ouse and ’old
forth in front of it. The ’Ouse is frightened of us,
and that’s why they wants to shut us up.” And
while Muster Stooart and the rest of the ’Ouse
«hivered in their shoes at the dread prospect, the
meeting adjourned to think out what compensa-
tion should be given to Mr. Andersen.

According to the Hindoo Patriot, “the
Ming of Cambodia has seat to the Buddhist Pali
College, in Colombo, Ceylon, a number of gifts,
»b« most important of which is a brush made of
His Majesty's own hair, to be used for sweeping the
room in which the image of Buddha is kept.” His
Majesty may be prettly humble, but he’s not yet
up to concert pitch. The humblest roan we ever
knew was a fellow who, not long ago, married a
woman whom he used to describe as “agoddess,’
and, in a week, the police, who heard a noise, went
in and found him “wiping the floor” with her.
And it wasn't the floor of the temple of Buddha,
either- It was the kitchen floor. She had b.'eu a
governess, and was not well up in cookery, so she
ad fried the schnapper in castor-oil.
A medical lecturer finds that the use of
anaesthetics, in fhe old-fashioned sense of the term,
is a gigantic error and a delusion. In his own
firaotide, whenever he has to reduce a patient to
□sensibility in order to perform an amputation,
he employs a much more simple method. He pre-
scribes: "Two ounces of whisky to be adminis-
tered by the mouth; the dose to be repeated every
ten minutes, until complete drunkenness la
reached.” The comatose state of the victim m«y
then, if the operator pleases, be improved upon
by adding one or two inhalations of ether or
chloroform, but this extra precaution may be
quite well dispensed with, and the operation is
effected under the most gratifying conditions.
" No manifestation of pain ’■ has been observed by
the learned surgeon, “ no unhealthy action In any
stump, and not a single death to mar the report.”
Such a song in praise of whisky has not been sung
for many a day. The Lancet condemns this style
of thing, wad says it is open to “righteous con-
demnation but we should say It would find con-
siderable favour among laymen in Australia, more
especially in Blue Ribbon circles.
From Alfred Ann, dearest,—l am
very lonely: forgive me,—come home. J.G.”
Now, don’t you hurry, Ann. You take your time.
He was very Independent after that little barney
you had about who should step out ua the cold oil-
cloth that wet morning and take in the milk, but
you can Just take our word for it he is crumpled
up now. You should have seen him trying to
«ook tne flsh the morning alter you left! It was a
sight to see the bream each time he snatched up
something wanted for the cooking, come leaping
out on the floor. It was a sweet thing, too, “ Ann,
dearest,” to behold him making coffee In the tea-
pot, and forgetting to take the leaves out. Quite
a crowd of the neighbours, also, assembled lu the
next yard to behold him holding the screaming
family under the water-tap, and afterwards rasp-
ing it with a wall-duster. When breakfast was
being got ready, “ Sister Ann,” it was a per-
fect harlequinade to behold the smashing of
the crockery, as a distracted husband vainly en-
deavoured to lay the table. In the end, Billy, the
eldest, drank out of the sauce-boat, little Cis out
of a soup-plate, while the appropriation of his
Bister's mug. labelled “A preseat to little Jane,”
by .young Ronald had the effect of causing a
bread-and-butter bombardment of a distracted
sire, who. when last seen by the family, was gnaw-
ing a raw red herring in the front room, with his
forehead pressed against the mantelpiece. When
it was five minutes to bis time of starting for bis
office, Bobby was found to have swallowed a
bream-bone and Cis to have sweetened her coffee
with half a cake of black-lead. Then, while 35
neighbours had all gone for the doctors they most
patronised, Itr was discovered that somebody bad
shot the retriever dog, who had got out
and had a fowl - breakfast, uninvited, round
the corner. A kind, motherly neighbour offered
to look out for the bouse that day, and on the un-
fortunate tenant’s departure, instantly let the
children wander away, and entertained balf-tbe-
stroet in the front parlour on the pick of the
groceries, and all the square gin that was left in
the bouse. No, Anal Bide yet awee. Wait until
dad has paid the lines on the school summonses,
got a new quilt in place of the big one that Johnny
burned with a tiro-stick; hold on until the man has
baled the water out of the copper they drowned
the kittens in, and the glazier (who got balf-a-
crown on account) comes back to mend all the top
windows, which wore broken by the neighbours,
under the impression that when the juveniles bad
set fire to the curtains, and the house was in a
blaze, the father was lying drunk under the four-
poster. Lots of time. And you may bo “ happy
yet.”
. These be parlous times, indeed. Theseoond
seal spoken of in the Apocalypse has burst wide
open again; the red horse is being saddled up, and
his rider Is preparing to take peace from the earth,
and crumple up things in general; the dogs of war
strain madly at the leash, the vultures sniff the
battle from afar, and nearer, clearer, deadlier than
before we catch the dread sound of the cannon’s
opening roar. Mutter has also gone up another
penny a pound, and the great Bartholdi statue
isn’t higher than the present price of corned beef.
Rut no matter; there’s a sweet littie cherub run-
ning the Gebmanton Times and Tumbebumba
Advocate who has his eye on the tricky doings of
European schemers, and who, when the crisis
comes will be found able and willing to rear up on
Bin hind less and cave in the head of that crisis at
a moment s notice. On Friday last, the divine affla-
tus which the «ermanton genius had Ailed himself
uo with the night before broke loose, and in a spirit
of prophetic frenzy, he wrote: “ The stormy petree
(whatever the Satan that is] shows itself to us in
tRe dragging down of the British flag on the west
coast of Africa.” A vain attempt to shake salt on
the stormv petree'stail appears to have been made
iSst here, but the wary bird was too fly, and the
Southern seer candidly declares: “We confess to
some degree of confusion in attempting to solve
the behaviour of the German captain.” This, how-
ever is at once accounted for by the next sen-
tence which says; "At this moment we are not in
possession of detailed facts, but It is a fact that the
British flag has bten removed and the Teutonic
banner placed in its stead." Such startling
intelligence as this, naturally sends one's blood up
to T5O” and Impels him to grab hold of a log of
wood and crack the “ Teutonic ” duffer’s spine in
with it but the man from lumberumba sets our
minds at rest once more by observing: “ Mr. Glad-
stone is a man of extraordinary genius [Tumber-
umba for appetite] and this Ensign removal is a fact
which cannot be expunged by any other means
than a due apology, which the peace-loving r re-
mior of England will promptly demand If he be
possessed of the pluck of a mouse.” For the sake
of the Grandoleman's reputation, we trust he can
muster the necessary amount of courage. If he
cannot, there is no other course for England to
nursue but to throw William down a well, and ap-
point the Tumbebumba Tebbor in his place.
Catching on to another trouble, our warlike q :ill-
wolloper says: “What may become of General
Gordon in the meantime we hardly care to predict,
but we can aflirm that his present extremelj
critical position in Egypt Is one sought on his own
part and not in accordance with Gladstonian
directions." This will be considerable news for
Mr Gordon, and if he has a spark of manliness in
him he will tender his resignation the moment bn
read’s that crushing sentence. Carefully corking
his favourite ginger beer brittle, and hastily plant-
ing It under a board in the floor, Gladstone s triend
catches on to the “Mlsmarckian trouble ’ once
more, and mantuHv declares: “ Wo have no otter
fair) to learn that England is at lault. It appears
to us that the source of provocation emanates
elsewhere. Anyhow, we are prepared to meet it,
and when Gt rmany is prepared to tight at sea (and
will be all at sea, we may imagine), then comes the
tug of war.” That’s the idea. Wait till Germany
is prepared to tight Tumberumba at sea, and then
vou shall see wUat you shall see, and don't you
forget itl The time for Germany to be s luelched
is now at hand, and if Germany's hordes are at-
tacked by England's braves with one-half the
ferocious enthusiasm with which Germany’s sau-
-1 sages a-e wolfed by the wild man of Tumberum-
; has woo4s„Jt’« a clear case of ‘‘bung ’' with the

Hymn to Humbug.
VERSES UNTO VICE.
( Contirtued .)
When Saxon Mpnarchs ruled the Heptarchy,
Before Duke William crossed the Channel sea
With his mailed knights (if judged by those who
trace
Bbscent from them, a most prolific race,)
The Wltenagenlote mot to debate,
And settle all the business of the State;
Saw that the right was done, through all the land,
And dealt out Justice with an even hand;
Its Senators feared not the Royal frown,
But e'en decreed who next should wear the crown;
Its name, translated, truthfully supplies
Its best description—“ Meeting of the Wise.”
But William's triumph on dark Senlaoh’s field,
Not only made the opposing army yield,
But, with th’ seli-same conquest, overthrew
Each rising hope the vanquished Saxons knew;
And of their liberty each eve the knell
Was sounded by the tyrant’s curfew bell.
Then, in the ancient Wltan’s honoured place,
The knights and barons of the Norman race
Raised up a Parliament (the word, translate,
Parler to speak, and menlir to misstate);
Two things which (if the Hansard’s page be true)
Some members strive, and wPh success, to do.
At first, a feeble copy of the Court,
Which it succeeded, and a base support
Of Royal lust; but strengthening, day by day.
Forced England’s kings its mandates to obey;
And, filled with patriots of the people’s choice,
In aid of Freedom, gave its vigorous voice.
Transplanted thence to the Antipodes,
It shared the fate of many English trees,
Which, strong and fruitful on their native soil,
Here grant no guerdon to the rustic’s toll;
But, bending to the sun’s untempered ray,
For lack of moisture, droop and fade away.
And thus our Parliament (in form the same
As that which justly bears a world-wide famfl 1 ,
And wisely framed to suit the nation’s needs,
By noble men controlled, does glorious deeds),
Though blessed with rights long centuries have
won.
Gives out poor fruit, where the immoderate sun
Of human power glows, with heat Intense,
Unchecked by honour, truth, or common sense.
Some men there are among the M.L.A.’s
Deserving of the Muse’s highest praise:
Men who would scorn to Join in Humbug’s train,
And prostitute their power for sake of gain.
But such true patriots, few and far between.
Like angels—often heard of —seldom seen,
Are so surrounded by King Humbug’s crew.
That we incline to doubt their virtue, too:
And dark suspicions, like a shadow, stay
By him who claims the letters M.L.A.
In England, when a youth returned from school
Is proved a dunce, and shows himself a fool,
So that he may not linger In the lurch,
His parents, wise, devote him to the Church;
But, over here, In sunny New South Wales,
Another custom, with like power, prevails—
’Tls this: whene’er a man has been a Jaok-
Of-all-trades, and in each has proved his lack
Of common honour, industry, and thrift,
His friends discover he has wondrous gift
Of statesmanship, and so their aid they lend
To bring him forward as the “ Poor Man’s Friend.”
The name is good, just note its humour grim,
All friends are poorer who have trusted him;
And yet, by oily speech and manner bland,
Schemes of reform, and ever ready hand—
The Orange vote—and wrongs o’ the Working
Class,
He wins the seat, and sports his Railway Pass;
(Or, we may say, in racing phrase, that he,
Although opposed by Brains and Honesty,
Don’s Humbug’s colours, and from end to end.
Pulls off the Member’s Plate with “Poor Man's
Friend”).
But, with true modesty he never shows
In Parliament, bis thought of others’ woes,
To speech on poor mens’ wrongs his mouth is
closed.
Save when the Immigration vote’s proposed;
Then he talks loudly of the sons of toll,
And poor, but honest, tillers of the soil;
But when that's passed his anger dies away,
Till roused again on Nomination day.
Than there’s the Member whose peculiar care
Is to obtain his District’s proper share
Of the expenditure (and this, please note,
Is just the price for which he sells his vote).
His only aim, bis ore and constant thought.
Is to contrive that others may be brought
To join with him in his conspiracies.
By holding forth inducements such as those:—
•’ You help my bridge, and I will vote with you,
When you attempt to put your railway through ;”
“ Assise to gain this school at Lonely Hill,
And I will speak in favour of your Bill; ”
Or, “ Help me get this compensation paid,
And, In Divisions, count on me for aid;
Or, “Just resume my land to form a lane,
And I'll turn round and vote with you again.”
Thus he deems Politics a useless load,
Not worth attention, until every road
in his electorate is “first-class” made.
And rivers bridged—not for the traveller’s aid—
But just to hold some wavering vote secure,
And make his seat in Parliament more sure.
The path of legislation he will block.
If Toady ville require a five-foot clock;
.Settlers may groan and tyranny may rule
For all he cares, if he but get his school:
Justice’s sun, like Joshua's, may stand still,
If he but wins his brldg3 for Toadyville.
’Tis said that once just such a delegate
Moved, on behalf of his electorate,
For money for a bridge—at least a score
Of bridges had been voted him before
For t hat same stream—and so a member rose,
And in sarcastic tone, said, ” I propose,
That we may stop, once and for all, his din
About this river, that we roof it in."
Of many a Senator the only claim
That he can show to wreath of lasting Fame,
Is money wasted in the District whence
He gained his right to go at th’ State's expense;
If such an one, a stranger might express
His wish to know what creed did he profess ?
Was his endeavour to reform abuse ?
And what sound measures did he introduce ?
Did he refuse, or snow his willingness,
To change the libel law, and free The Press ?
These several questions may be answered thus:
He never showed himself solicitous
About these points, he only cared to try
How many votes his tnlluenco could buy;
Ho never strove to climb Fame's toilsome ridge.
There stands his monument—(he Mueki Bridge.
Esau, when by keen hunger desperate grown.
Sold the inheritance by right his own
For trilling value, and for this his name.
Through every age, has borne reproach and shame.
Hut a more shameful bargain here is made,
For, by betraying trust, the price is paid
For vote of road, or bridge; and though it’s true
That no gain to the seller may accrue,
Yet he who steals to increase his neighbour’s pelf,
May sometimes do so to enrich himself.
But steady, Muse, suppose we take a spell.
And then, perchance, another song may tell
Of other Scions, of Maoquarie-street,
Who, by some Lodge's aid, have won their seat.

Little girl In
Surry Hills
Used to w ear a
Frock with frills;
Loved her Pa, the
Dogs and cats;
Hated beetles,
Hated rats.
Pa put powder
On the floor,
And with rats he
Went to war.
Killed the vermin,
One by one;
Squelched the beetles—
Twas such fun!
One night Pa went
To the show;
Little girl crept
Down tip-toe;
Softly ope’d the
Parlour door.
Powder saw blaze
On the lloor.
Powder looked so
Pretty, it
Tempted her to
Taste a bit.

The moat remarkable cookery-book ever

The Illustrations are life-size photographs of the

grounds of a certain lawn-tennis club are close to
a railway station, when a train halts, the pas-

only result so far, however. Is the Increased beauty
of the ladies’ lawn-tennis dresses. .. Charles Ueade

they haven’t got the other advantages....“ Do you
play much, Miss Vercy ? ” he asked, as they strolled
out after the waltz. “ No, I am out of practice,” ]
she replied. “ Out of practice ? Well, 1 didn't i

Weren’t you playing ?” “ Last night!’’ sheechoed,
“ why, I was at the opera.” Then thoughfully she
added: “ Why, it was last night the man came and
tuned onr piano.’ The Queen’s “ More Leaves”

Ladies’ handkerchiefs in Paris this season are
made to match dresses. If the gown is brown, the
kerchief has a brown border; if striped or

very best photos and beautifully produced, they
are an immeme rage. Some fathers, terribly In-

have applied tor iojunctions to stop the printing.
, Spo-aklng ot the young girls who flock into the
circulating libraries, Zola says: “Any story, no
matter how foolish, is good enough for them, pro-
vided it be sufficiently sentimental. Neither poetry
of language, nor truthful observation of life and
manners is asked for.” Zola is right: woman must
have her emotions catered for. And it is curious
that girls will boldly aak the keeper of a library

Ada Beach, of Bethel, U. 8., secured a husband in

Few discoveries in art have been so wonj erfnl as
Ur Hand-Smith’s production of endoliths. This
discovery, the result of many years’ experiments,
is briefly that certain meta'lic combinations ot
oiemicil matter will penetrate stone or marble
straight down to any depth, in a clear, defined line,
. ithoi.t spreading. That is, any pa nting on the
surface goes right through. It is done on the sur-
face just as easily as on canvas; and an apparatus
is employed to drive the colours in. Sections of
thin stone can be «awn off and polished, the
colours, once in, being indelible, and all sinking to
equal depths. Alreaoy, the painting of endoliths

“A Chinamau, rejoicing in the name o

Miner. Let us grapple with It. At a time when
society is shaken to its foundations, and the ver
theory of property in land has become as difiicuf
to handle as the dynamite we’re shipped outside
the Quay, hero comes a Chinaman—a man of clay
wlth-a-glaze-on—and “rejoices” in the name o
Long Keel Not content with “rejoicing,” he
takes an oath— swears, blasphemes, in short—tha
he is a liege subject of our Queen— (Bring out the
sabre of my sires, boy)—“and became a natura
Hard British subject,” says the mad legend. (Bring
out everything that’s heavy, sonny. Your father
is not so old as be looks.) Whati we, who have
spread ourselves over the world, chopped down
forests, and almost smothered ourselves in trying
to save Ireland-are we, at this date, to be hum-
bugged by the shallow schemers of France ? For
Franco put Long Keo up to this. How else do you
explain that he can bo “naturalised?’’ It is as
plain as the countenance of our enemy that this is
another little dodge of M. Ferry. They are sweat-
ing over that Waterloo defeat. And they are mad
over the loss of Alsace and Lorraine. So Johnny

By the Liguria, we are placed in possession
of important files. The British Association are
holding their annual session in Montreal, and, for
the first time since the Bellast gathering, wiien
Professor Tyndalt hazarded the conjecture that
two and two are four, approximately, this learned
gathering has gone out of the usual way, and ven-
tured to discuss some of the old theories concern-
ing mind and matter. Before we go on with the
news, we ll relate a little anecdote. Dr. Lardner,
whose innumerable treatises on scientific subjects
we have glanced at askant, delivered a discourse
at the Bristol meeting Just after some madmen
had begun to talk about the application of strain
to vessels. Heiproved to a demonstration that,
for marine purposes, the thing could never gee.
And the Association said, "So say all of us.”
A mouth afterwards he cleared to America,
in a steamship with another man’s wife. But that
might happen to anybody. Bern's the point. At
the Montreal gathering, it was decided that, in the
interest of science, some crucial questions should
be driwn up and forwarded to the leading
thinkers of the age, and that the replies should be
read at the next annual meeting in Melbourne or
Sydney- according to which Premier sent the
invitation first. Here is Alfred Bennett’s paper
with the reply :—(li. Assuming that the ultimate
constitution of matter contains within itself all the
possibilities of vital and mental phenomena, and
that intellect is but the fortuitous product of cer-
tain collocations of matter, and, assuming further,
that the theory of the soul is but a remnant of the
organised dream of aboriginal man, how do you
account for the metempirlc illusion of a personal
identity ? Answer: “ Back in Five minnits A. 8.”
