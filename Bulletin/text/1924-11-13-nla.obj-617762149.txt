Man’s Ancestors
It gives an altogether false idea of the
truth to suppose that Professor Elliot Smit 1
thinks that Man’s direct ancestor was the
charming little tarsier of Borneo a furry
little beast with the remarkable power of
looking directly towards its tail, of turning
its head as though it were mounted upon a
swivel-joint. As Elliot Smith’s speculations
are probably true, and cast a good deal of
light upon evolution, it is worth while to
consider exactly what lie lias said. (Essays
on the Evolution of Man, by Grafton Elliot
Smith; Oxford University Press and Angus
and Robertson.) . . .
Man is not a monkey witlu a big brain,
he is rather a colossal brain, a very chimera
of a brain, a frightful affront to all other
brains, that walks about in the body ol a
monkey. Man did not develop as a body; lie
developed as a terrible brain, which, acquir-
ing new faculties, dragged its body upwards;
it was the evolution of the brain and its new
power of profiting by experience that dilter-
entiated man from all the other beasts ; and,
late in the evolution of man,, after Nature
had tried her hand on several “first attempts,
it occurred to him alone of all the beasts
that it would add to his survival value if
he could tell his fellows of his past experi-
ences, so that each individual member should
know what to avoid and what methods had
been successfully tried in given cases of diffi-
culty. The incarnation of this marvellous
power of associative memory lay in the cere-
bral cortex, in that thin sheet of grey mat-
ter that attains so formidable a size in the
brain of man, and is so comparatively despic-
able in the brain of even the gorilla and the
chimpanzee. „ ■ . ~
Any animal is the creature of the world
that it can know; and what it can know de-
pends upon the activity of its sense organs,
which indicate what it can see, what hear,
what smell, and the rest. Very primitive
animals seem to dwell in a very primitive
world, as shown by little, differentiation m
the powers of their special senses. It is
probable that at first the monkey tribe did
not even have the power of stereoscopic vision
which would enable them, to distinguish sub-
stance from shadow; their two eyes did not
move exactly together, and the animal, there-
fore, could not tell how far away it was from
its foe or its prey or even from its mate.
At first Nature tried to increase the power
of smell, and to this day the dog lives in a
world of smells. That is why, as has been
so well observed by the sentimentalists,
Towser never looks up to Heaven. . Man,
being so superior as to be endowed with an
immortal soul, does not have to be always
earth-grubbing, but can duly seek his G<kl
up aloft. You will hear this wise remark in
many a pulpit, and undoubtedly it lias influ-
enced thousands who wish to believe in the
improbable. The real reason is that Man
has long passed the stage of dependence on
smell; he has at least five windows Avidely
open to the universe, and none overshadows
the other as it does in poor little undignified
Towser, who has to make sure that he is
greeting a female friend and not a male by
smelling. The first attempt at stereoscopic
vision seems to luiA'e been made by the pretty,
tiny Tarsier, who acquired it by the uncom-
mon method of turning his whole head until
lie could look entirely backwards. Thus
stimulated, the brain of Tarsier began to
develop in the region of the parts which con-
trol vision, and the insignificant animal be-
gan to have an enormous advantage over
its competitors in the trees. It \\ T as thus
that Tarsier seems to have become the origi-
nal ancestor, not of Man alone, but of all
the lordly race of the primates, the apes, the
monkeys and of Man.
But it will be exceedingly difficult .to prove
that no monkey-ancestry entered into the
wonderful upward climb of Man.
When Tarsier took to the trees it had to
develop an amazing agility; and thencefor-
ward the Avay was open for the development
of the monkeys, lemurs, gibbons and such
beasts ; and as each special sense developed
in its turn, the corresponding parts of their
brains enlarged to meet the now demands.
But the whole point is that no single sense
ever at the expense of the others,
and Man’s brain did not become lopsided.
As Tarsier began to be more stimulated by
its vision than by its nose, its hands began
to become more useful in the way of examin-
ing the things that it saw so clearly; and
thus it slowly became the general ancestor
of all the primates. Thus our common
though millions-of-years-removed ancestor de-
veloped that wonderful command of all the
muscles of its body and the vast prefrontal
lobes of its brain that so distinguishes Man
from all the other animals. As he used
his brain, so it increased. The erect atti-
tude was not alone the cause of the great-
ness of M'an ; it was a factor which enabled
his growing brain to help him in its struggle
for existence. It enabled the hand to become
the chief instrument in furthering Man’s
upward climb—that marvellous hand which
enabled him to put primitive things to uses
suggested by his even more marvellous brain.
But the brain came first, and we still see to-
day relics of his primitive past in many ways,
which are quite meaningless if we presume
that the body, bones and muscles of him pre-
ceded the brain.
Pithecanthropus credits of Java seems to
have belonged to the first known race of
men ; it Avas more than a lemur, as German
anthropologists first suggested, for no mere
lemur could have possessed so vast a brain
in proportion to its height. A lemur
AA-jth a brain the size of Pithecanthro-
pus would have had to be many feet high.
Avhereas Pithecanthropus Avas not so tall as
an ordinary man. Probably many thousands
of years later came Neanderthal Man, whose
debased skull Huxley wickedlv compared to
that of a certain historical bishop; but. then,
Huxley did not like bishops. They had been
too rude to him for daring to say that Man
had ascended from an ape. It is many
years since I read about the incident, but.
speaking entirely from a somoAvhat uncertain
memory, I think the poor bishop's name was
Oddo. If the good Oddo was really like Nean-
derthal Man he must have been indeed repul-
sn 7 e, for the creature stood about five feet
high, walked with a short-sighted slouch,
was furry, probably ate nuts, and could not
even speak.
Then the ice melted away, and the great
race of the Cro-Magnards killed off the. Nean-
derthaloids in the intervals of drawing its
wonderful cave-pictures of mammoths and
bison s. Elliot Smith appears to rather dis-
like the name Neolithic Period for the age
that comes after the Cro-Magnards, but
speculates amusingly upon the horror that
doubtless was aroused among the men who had
been accustomed to chip flints in the good
old way, by the discovery that better flints
could be knapped by polishing them. The
genius who discovered the Neolithic way of
knapping flints must have been one of the
boldest thinkers that ever existed in the
world. Doubtless Neolithic Man settled the.
matter for a time by the ancient method, still
in use among certain people in similar cir-
cumstances, of knocking him over the head.
But the spirit of Man will on, though always
with the fiercest opposition from Man him-
self.
There is not space to detail the features
of Heidelberg Man, of the Man of Piltdown,
of Bhodesian Man, of the Man and the Dog
of Talgai; but they are all described with
authority in this most delightful book. What
a mercv it is to meet a great scientist who
can write! But there, will probably never
be another T. 11. Huxley.

An Almost Unknown Volume
The Bible begins with a naked man in a
garden, and finishes with a visionary man
on an island. Very little is known about
its authorship, except in the case of Paul,
who seems an authentic and fixed object, but
the oldest book must have been written before
the days of Abraham. This is the only way
to explain why Job and his friends failed
to mention Abraham. Very little is known,
either, about the contents of Holy Writ. As
an instance, the good and learned men who
compiled the “Oxford Cyclopedic Concor-
dance,” printed, in a helpful way, at the
end of the more high-class and costly Scrip-
tures, tell, among other things, which is the
sliortest verse in the Old Testament. And
they tell the wrong one.
The early part of the Bible consists of
legend, and there are giants in it, as there
should be in all good legend. This develops
into history of a loose sort, with gaps of
various ' sizes, but still it is history, and
appears reliable in places. There are a few
detached stories like those of Job, Ruth,
Esther and Jonah, all without dates and
mostly without address. The psalms are
many and eloquent, full of sorrow and re-
joicing. They are apparently the work of.
many hands spread over many years, and
they are so vague that it is hardly possible
to decide what is being sorrowed over or
rejoiced about. The prophecies are fine but
lugubrious works, interspersed with imagin-
ings which seem utterly crazed, as when one
attests that Babylon, which is still dry, had
been already in his time drowned by the
sea, and another swears that Damascus,
which still stands and prospers, had been
wiped off the map. These, and many other
quaint mental and spiritual gyrations, lend
excitement to the foretellings. Sometimes
the prophet is so enveloped in a dust of
words that what he is prophesying about is
matter for the wildest conjecture. However
much these good men were able to foresee
the- future, they didn’t foretell, and thus
speed up, one useful invention, and they
worked in a painfully narrow orbit. They
could spend a lifetime’s anger on some prin-
cipality one half-day’s ass-ride across.
The proverbial philosophy of the Scrip-
ture, which centres round the legendary
figure of Solomon, constitutes fine literature,
far superior to Martin Tupper or Walt Whit-
man, and better spelt than Josh Billings.
The two Chronicles read like a clumsy and
incapable rehash, by the junior sub-editor,
of far better work, the purpose being to make
a case for the family of his employer, some
scion of the House of David. In their low
literary quality they stand practically alone.
There is no excuse for the existence of Chron-
icles, with its tales of how little Judah had
a standing army of (at times) as many as
1,160,000 soldiers in addition to garrisons,
yet could apparently only find a corporal’s
guard of men when men were most wanted.
The practical interest of the Bible largely
centres in the fact that it is so full of things
which few people imagine, and so empty of
things which most people imagine. To a
new student it might seem as if a work had
been accepted without question as a cookery
book, and then, after many years, some act
of inspection had broken the spell and proved
it to be a dictionary. The Scripture takes
slavery for granted, and the Scriptural
writers left that institution much as they
found it. It makes no clear allusion to
penance, and it has a low opinion of women.
Only two Scriptural books are named after
women, and they are unimportant. Mem-
bers of the sex weren’t supposed to succeed to
the throne. If there had been Parliaments
then they wouldn’t have possessed a vote.
It is laid down even in the later and more
progressive New Testament that they aren’t
to teach, or to wear pretty clothes, or to rule
over men in any way, but are to be squashed
“in silence, with nil subjection”—not merely
some subjection, but the whole lot of it.
About divorce the Book speaks with two
voices, or even with three —a Deuteronomy
voice, a Matthew voice, and a Mark voice.
It is rather an inversion of ideas that the
Scripture has no visible objection to
polygamy, and has an objection to, or a
total ignorance of, clerical celibacy. The
Old Testament says that the priest must not
marry a dissipated or divorced female, but
apparently he may marry several respectable
women. It goes on to say that the high
priest “shall take a virgin of his own people
to wife.” In a sort of parenthesis it is
added that if a priest’s daughter becomes a
lady with a past she is to be burned “with

use for the purpose. And it is laid down in
rhe' New Testament that every priest and
deacon must be the husband o one
and so he must not overdo things. Also tney
•ire not to be really heavy drink.is. Lon
Sr, to a general and wholly inverted
opinion held by some of the more ignorant
sects, the sacred volume not only permits
but commands woman’s marriage with her
deceased husband’s brother. At least it com-
mands him to marry her and takes the
widow’s consent for granted, she being a
female and of small account. And the near-
est it seems to get to prohibiting mariiage
with a deceased wife’s sister is that it bids
a man not to marry the wife s sister before
the wife is deceased.
Opponents of capital punishment find little
or nothing to go upon in Holy W rit, lhe
prohibition against homicide appears to have
been directed against push outrage and pi 1-
vate feud, though even the latter was recog-
nised after a liberal fashion in the legisla-
tion concerning cities of refuge. But execu-
tion by legal process, and often by very
casual process, was as common as Sunday.
One day there were 3000 executions. Mostly
death was by the throwing of bricks. Some-
times, when there was a lack of brick-
throwers, the victim was mussed up with a
sword. The priest’s too-festive daughter had
a road of her own, as already mentioned. The
execution of sculptors was probably extra
prompt, for the prohibitions against the
making of things like Captain Cook’s statue
were of great intensity. In addition to pro-
viding against Nelson Illingworth and his
tribe, the old law was solid on capital
punishment for witches and wizards, but
the definition was loose, and there was little
of it. So a time came when any old woman
with a cat, especially if she also possessed a
beard, or any solitary young woman with a
kitten, or any one who cured people unusu-
ally well or invented things unusually strange,
was ripe for a hurried and very unpleasant
exit.
JAMES EDMOND.
Unclean Realism
George Gissing had little honor and scant
reward in his lifetime. Yet he was the
founder of the school of realists which came
into prominence with the close of the Vic-
torian age. Gissing dipped his pen into the
black ink of a bitter experience. He was
a realist because life in the sordid environ-
ment of poverty, dirt and hopelessness was
his life. He bared his soul that he might
become the voice of his fellow-sufferers, and
throughout his realism was inspired by an
ideal: to raise this submerged life to higher
ground. The realism of to-day seeks to link
ns closer to the beasts of the field. It carries
a banner blazoned “Truth” and shuffles its
feet in the gutter.
Notable among this little group of modern
realists is one of the authors of a recently-
published novel, The Boy in tnc Bush, by
D. H. Lawrence and M. L. Skinner (Martin
Seeker; Robertson and Mullens). Mr. Law-
rence is widely known to readers of fiction
and of that jerky, impressionistic poetry
which suggests Walt Whitman and water.
The reader consequently takes up this book
with some anticipation of what is before him.
The story is without plot, or such plot as
there may be is negligible ; incident and char-
acter are merely the material out of which
the ego of the bush boy is manufactured.
Jack Grant, when not quite 18, was sent
to Westralia because he was “too tiresome
to keep at home,” and his parents “feared
a waster in the bud. So they shipped the
bud to the Antipodes, to let it blossom there
upside-down.” At that time (1882) “it was
still a long, long w r ay to Australia, and the
land was still full of the lure of promise.”
At Fremantle young Jack was met by a
friend of his father: a highly-placed officer
in the British Army, who at one time had
exercised official duties in the West, where
he had married an Australian-born woman.
She was “ripe, with warm coloring and soft
flesh....warm with a jolly sensuousness and
good in a wicked sort of way.” The
friend launches Jack into “colonial” life.
He is sent to Wandoo, a farming property
held by the Ellis family, kindred of his.
Later on he goes out back, then into the far
Nor’-West, returns after two years, and
finally goes prospecting. He strikes a rich
lode and becomes wealthy. That is the itin-
erary. The meticulous critic could no doubt
pick many lsoles in the authors’ attempt to
give their story true local color and to de-
pict the conditions of life in the bush over
TO years ago, yet it is but justice to say
that broadly it is done with success. It is
also just to say that’ here and there in this
uninviting book there are vivid passages and
evidences of n genuine appreciation of natu-
ral beauty. The pity of it is that the
authors couiyi not have found more to appre-
ciate in batman nature. The book intro-
duces us to all the stock characters in a
novel of Australian bush life—the swaggie,
the cockie, the rouseabout and the rest; and
also in detail to those central figures on
whom the adventures of its hero turns.
There, is “(Fran’ Ellis.” that “old witchcat,”
despising her unmarried daughters for their
virginity: “I’d rather they’d gone wrong
and died ire the bush, like your aunt who
had a child hy Mary’s father.. . .You’ve only
got to live once, Jack Grant. You know
when your spirit glows. Trust that. That’s
You. That’s the spirit of God in you.” It
became his god, the only god he knew, the
spirit that glows; the lust of life and pro-
creation. Tom, slow, stupid, indomit-
able worker, dependable, faithful, a pig in
drink, but lovable for all that —one of the
very few in this book who are. Lennie,
quick-witted but wedded to the soil—just
living and begetting. Mary: “turning in
the door to give him a look and an intimate,
furtive-seeming smile.” She who was “like
another kind of cat: not the panther sort,
but the quick, dark, knowing sort.” And “Red
Easu ’ (Esau) : “Red Easu met his eyes,
and the two stared at one another. It was
the defiance of the hostile colonial, brutal
and retrogressive against the old mastery of
the old country.”
Jack listened to the Australian voices and
the Australian accent around him. “The
careless, slovenly speech in the uncontrolled
slack, careless voices.. . .There was an aban-
don in it all—an abandon of restrictions and
confining control. Why have control? Why
have authority? Why not let everybody do
as they liked? Why not? That was what
Australia was for, a careless freedom An
easy, unrestricted freedom. At least, out
in the bush. Every man to do as he liked.
Here “you didn’t do anything for your coun-
try except boast of it to strangers and leave
it to get along as best it might. And as tor
your family, you cared for that, but m a
queer, centreless fashion. The old English
alertness grew darker and darker. He could
feel his body, the English cool body of his
being, slowly melting down and being in-
vaded by a new tropical quality. lie had
rebelled against restraint m England, and
in this new land had found his seeming free-
dom ; but in the lonely evening Jack began
craving again, craving for Monica, tor a
woman, for some object for his passion to
settle on. And he knew again, as he had
always known, that nowhere is free,, so long
as man is passionate, desirous, yearning, llis
only freedom is to find the object of his pas-
sion and fulfil his desires.”
These extracts sufficiently trace the pro-
gress of this passionate pilgrim on the path
obviously designed for him by the authors
of his decadent being, and delineate the
equally obvious arrangement of “properties”
to give the pilgrimage vraiscmblnnoe. In
the end, after much fighting, drinking and
soliloquising, he attains the object of his de-
sire, the “yellow-eyed” Monica. He found
her with a child by Red Easu dragging at
her skirt, an infant by one “Pink-eye Percy
in her arms. Having made the yellow-eyed
and prolific lady the mother of two bouncing
boys—twins—and having “struck it rich” in
a gold-mine, he went in pursuit of Mary, and
finding her explained the position. Mary
did not accept his proposal in a kindly
spirit. The hero was thereupon much dejected,
and had to cast about for another prospec-
tive wife. Happy chance sent him one in
the person of a young lady of very advanced
views who arrives riding on a grey mare,
speedily put on terms of equine affection
with Jack’s red stallion. The advanced
young lady thinks that later on she “might
like to be a man’s second or third wife,”
and they agree to try the Abraham scheme
at Christmas. “Then the moon will come to
the sun, eh? Bring the mare with you.
She’ll probably be in foal.” Meantime Monica
suckles the twins.
The book is not without power of a kind,
has strong dramatic episodes, such as the
fight with Easu and his subsequent killing,
and seeks to maintain a sort of seriousness
of purpose in long soliloquies by Tack when
he goes searching for the old “Gran’s” spirit
of God within him. It has dark sayings re-
garding death. “The two are never separate,
life and death. And in the vast dark king-
dom of afterwards, .the Eord of Death is Eord
of Life, and the God of Life and Creation is
Lord of Death.” This sounds very imposing,
and is the new school of realism’s conception
of wisdom.
There is so much unconscious humor for
the Philistine to chuckle at in this book that
the reader, weighing it in the scales for lust
or laughter, hesitates whether he will place
it on his bookshelf with old Joe Miller or
deposit it in the garbage-tin. Probably he
will do the latter.
T. B. C.
The Lingo
One supposes that “righto,” “goodo” and
similar current exclamations will have their
meaning and origin duly set forth in future
slang dictionaries. It will be easy to quote
such “improved” words as examples of the
modern desire to add needed strength and
music to the “inadequate and unrefined”
Anglo-Saxon of John Bunyan. And the
sin against English involved in the addition
of a mere vowel to common (not to say
“low”) words is really such a little one that
we can hardly hope to see the professors
and purists doing anything spectacular by
way of protest. But what of a phrase like
“Too right,” now in everyday use as an equi-
valent for the expressive “My oath” or “My
blanky oath,” and meaning, of course, “very”
or “quite” right? How will the dictionary-
makers explain its origin; how excuse its
construction ; how placate the professors of
English who will rise in revolt before they
will accent “too” as a permissible equiva-
lent of “very” or “perfectly” as a qualifier
of “right”? 11l news may be sadly regarded
as “only too true,” and the report of an
untoward circumstance deplored as “only
too right.” But there is no sadness or re-
gret in the modern “too right.” Quite the
opposite. Therefore it is absurd. But
apparently it is as fixed in the slanguage as
its ancient (and perhaps paternal) relative,
the “only too willing”, or “only too glad” or
“happy” enormity of nearly all the
newspapers and their terribly earnest country
correspondents. All in vain do occasional
sub-editors point out to cubs and correspond-
ents—and eke to senior scribes below the
rank of chief-of-staff —that if a person is
“only too” glad, or willing, or what not. that
person stands charged with an ulterior
motive and is (or ought to be) an object of
suspicion. The sub-editor may rave as he
likes, the misused phrase persists in every
Australian daily paper.
Another equally persistent “bloomer” in
nearly every Australian paper is the use of
the participle “providing” in place of the
conjunction “provided,” though leader-writers
on the metropolitan dailies appear to have
discovered that they have been using a word
that is taboo in every Act of Parliament,
and, consequently, is never employed in Parlia-
mentary speech except by the newest or
most illiterate members. One or two of
Tasmania’s papei's, however, are still editori-
ally assuring their readers that “the trouble
may be overcome providing the Government
exercises the necessary caution.” The
weekly papers, with few exceptions, are also
addicted to “providing.” I have found it
even in The Bulletin —three times in the
last three decades.
Australian writers certainly do more “pro-
viding” than those of England, Canada,
South Africa or America, but there was a
time when “pious editors” in Massachusetts
embodied in their daily creed such phrases
as “purvidin’ I’m in offis.” And there are
still some British journalists addicted to the
participle. Indeed, a perusal of the most
modern book by a Fleet-streeter—“Journal-
ism for Profit,” by one Michael Joseph—
almost makes one wonder whether, after all.
the word “providing” is really wrong. Any-
way, the book is chock full of interesting
information for budding journalists in such
phrases as “providing you have mastered the
rudiments,” “providing you know your edi-
tor,” and “providing you have kept a copy
of your manuscript.” Thus it would appear
that, provided the Joseph book secures the
wide circulation its author expects and de-
serves, it is already “rather late to trouble.”
JOHN DRAYMAN.
Cleanskin Verses
Rome Australian Poems, by Henry Richard
Ilill, dedicated “to Australia and to all Aus-
tralians in Australia,” are true to label.
They are Australian, and they are some
poems. The dedication fits the fervent stac-
cato cries of patriotism. Mr. Hill is all-
Australian, but he is all poet, too. In a
short, sharp epitome of poesy lie says
I long- for love,
For love I sigh;
I live for love,
For love I die.
And in “My Fatal Destruction”: —
I love love and I hate hate,
I love my fate save when I hate;
If I must hate I hate that fate,
For livingly I love, but fatally I hate.
Naturally the possessor of such a virile,
two-handed muse writes masculine verses of
bis own country—cleanskin verses that have
never known the brutal emasculation of the
branding yards. I instance :
Australians ! Meet the drought bravely !
Prepare for the worst! Right and well!
Consider the future most gravely ;
There is need ! All portents foretell!
And a little of the best of the bush is in
Mr. Hill's “Dear Old Chum”:—
Our dear old chum is nearly done,
Ilis well-spent life is almost rim ;
And yet to hear him’s real good fun,
Altho’ he has but saying one:
“Chum, chum, with a chum, chum,
Chum chum chum.”
Each morning he g/ts out of bed,
He brushes well his old bald head ;
Hands round he shakes, nought does instead,
To each one, and for grace is said:
“Chum, chum, with a chum, chum,
Chum chum chum.”
If someone tries to take him down,
His face takes on a most quaint frown ;
Oh no! you cannot do him brown,
He winks and says to his renown:
“Chum, chum, with a chum, chum,
Chum chum chum.”
And when the children go to bed,
He lollies gives for prayers well said ;
His hands in blessing touch each head,
And angels by his prayer are led:
“Chum, chum, with a chum, chum,
Chum chum chum.”
In armchair then he has his smoke ;
He takes life as a real good joke;
He falls asleep like most old folk,
Then to God in Heaven these words are spoke:
“Chum, chum, with a chum, chum,
Chum chum chum.”
There have been more graceful poets, but
none more sincere than Mr. Hill. And he is
all bis own. He owes nothing to Shakspeare
or Keats, Milton or Tennyson. And he is
like no other poet in the world.
R. B.
A Satchel of Books
The Majestic Mystery, by Denis Mackail (Heine-
mann). Humor plays a large part in this fairly-well-
sustained story about a theatrical manager turned
corpse and the efforts of two journalists to discover
his slayer. The red herrings are strong enough
to draw even the shrewdest reader away from
the trail, and the denouement is unexpected. The
least suspected character in the book violates the
sixth commandment, but the way it happened smells
like a stale fish.
The Secret of Greylands, by Annie Haynes (John
Lane). Miss Haynes, is rapidly acquiring a reputa-
tion as one of the most skilled modern writers of
mystery and detective stories. To help a reader
through a tedious railway journey of some hours is
probably the limit of ambition in writers of such
stories. Miss Haynes, with the usual ingredients—one
murdered woman, one false marriage, one wicked Peer,
half a dozen supernumerary knights and commoners,
with lovers to taste—succeeds In producing an appetis-
ing dish of amazement and mystery. There are some
touches of character and a few descriptive passages,
but the dominant note, as it should be in such novels,
is action —always action.
Human Relations in- the Light of Christ, by H. C.
Carter, M.A. (Heffer). A series of addresses delivered
at Cambridge. The relations of the rich and the
poor, the employer and the employed, the husband
and the wife are among some of the more outstanding
human adjustments dealt with. The author draws a
rather queer distinction between the attitude to divorce
of the Christian as such and the Christian as citizen.
“We must not,” he says, “confuse in our - minds
what the Church of Christ should witness to as the
Christian way, and what it should seek to impose
upon man and woman by the arm of secular law.”
The questicn under what conditions divorce should
be recognised in a community is a matter of secular
law. “For a Government to impose upon a non-
Christian community—say, like China —a law about
marriage which accorded with the moral truth about
it as the Christian sees it might be a disastrous
policy. And it may be that a Government in England
would be acting with only a less degree of®folly if ’t
tried to impose here the Christian law. The Chrbtirn
law in the nature of it is not imposable, for the
Christian is not under law but under grace.”
♦
From Randolph Bedford: “Wart” (B. 23/10/'24),
writing on the ineffective Australian copyright,
says Britain’s reply to Prime Minister Bruce is
that “the Commonwealth cannot demand the setting
up and printing of books in Australia as the con-
diticn of Australian copyright.” The Common-
wealth can enact anything it pleases, and Britain
dare- not veto. The old argument against complete
Australian copyright was the preponderating loss to
Australia in cutting loose from the Berne Conven-
tion ; but that loss, I submit, would be nothing.
The force that gave American authors a chance
was the U.S.A. rigid Copyright Law and no other
thing, and the U.S.A. experience would be repeated
here. Australian writers do not need relief from
American competition any more than they do from
British; and the American writer of fiction does
not undersell Australian novelists with bad work
as the British writer does. America did not
produce “If Winterbottom Comes,” a dull and stupnl
book which the semi-illiterate public of England
thinks is great literature; and America did not
produce “The Sheik,” the work of an English
maiden lady writing the exaggerated sexualism
wmch the Nonconformist Conscience furtively en-
joys. Australia would secure effective copyright if
the people who cry against American books and
American plays and American movies were pro-
Australian, and not merely anti-American, which is
to say pro-British. Australia will make its own
books and plays and pictures when it decides to
laugh at the idea that it cannot make its own
copyright law.

Irw BENTONS 415
A TOAST WORTH
DRINKING.
At the christening of the first-born, the coming of
age, and the wedding; at the launching of ships, at
public functions when the very best is a matter of
course, there you will find Lindeman’s Champagne
invariably chosen, a wine of unsurpassed excellence
and worthy of correct serving.
It should be cold, but not too cold. Never warm,
for warm champagne is unpalatable to the cultured
tastes. At 50 degrees Fahrenheit you will find
it superb.
To observe correct style, fine crystal glasses should
be used, of tulip shape and hollow stems —never in
the shallow wide-rimmed kind so commonly used.
Drink this fine wine under these conditions, and
you will appreciate that exquisite quality which
has made Lindeman’s Champagne the choice of
connoisseurs.

In the Ballrooms, in the fashionable rendezvous of
Australia s leading cities, and wherever the nation’s
beautiful women foregather, you will sense the
adorable fragrance of Atkinson’s latest creation in
perfumery —Californian Poppy Perfume.
11 is, undoubtedly, the Dance Perfume par excellence ,
for its exquisite sweetness is positively enchanting
and lingers for days with the most delightful
persistency. That is why Californian Poppy Perfume
has proved one of the greatest successes ever known
in the perfumery trade.
Californian Poppy Perfume is, admittedly, one
of the greatest masterpieces of the perfumer’s
art this century has produced, and every lady
should make a special point of obtaining a bottle.
Californian Poppy is a floral essence of unique
refinement and great concentration and is therefore
most economical in use.
For enhancing the beauty of the complexion,
Atkinson’s also prepare an attendant series of
Beauty Creams, Complexion Powders, Soaps, Bath
Salts, etc. —all of superb quality and daintily scented
with Californian Poppy Perfume.

He kneels by it each morning, brown and

Its small still life he stoops to know and

I hear him asking it when none is there
If it shuts up and sleeps through the long

O happy flower, in lovesome solitude,
Calling a child to worship morn by morn,
Has the earth breathed you in remembrance
Of all the daisies man has ever viewed?
And do they dream again for him, new-

The Garden.
There is a garden I have known
When most my soul has been alone ;
Where yellow evening, dreaming down
Across dim waters, shadow-brown,
Draws over all a phantom dress
Of strange and sombre loveliness,
As though some god of malice planned
A sad and evil fairyland.
Oft when the fires of magic lay
On crystal altars of the day
My restless heart has wandered there;
And all within seemed very fair.
Ah, surely dwelt no fear at all
’Twixt silent pool and lichened wall
When steeped in mid-noon’s golden trance
I named it garden of romance.
But when the haunted mystery
Of heavy night begins to be,
Then shadows, formless, come and go
Within that lonely place I know;
And, slowly, slowly creeping near,
A vast inexorable fear,
The pulse of ancient sorrow, comes
Upon my heart like goblin drums!
Then, past the stars of God I gaze
Across a blind and monstrous maze,
And in the midst thereof divine
A dead lamp in a lightless shrine.
With more than mortal horror pale,
I see the rending of Life’s veil—
I name it then, with shuddering breath,
The garden of the Dread of Death!

The Other Woman’s Words.
Did you suppose, who are so rich
In all love's lovely imagery,
I should not mark the one name which
You yet have kept from me?
Your love-words clothed me like a queen—
Dress after shimmering splendid dress
Of flame and flower and jewel-sheen,
Desire or tenderness.
Around me like a flock of birds,
So many, only one I missed,
Lighted or flew your colored words,
Nestled and sang and kissed.
Wild praises quivered hovering
About this ordinary head —
Most sweet, mpst proud, most lovely thing—
“ Dearest” you never said.
Most wonderful and darlingest
You’ve called me: those are not the same.
Would you believe I love you best
For holding back that name?
Not all your jests at law and life,
Nor all your hot heart’s pulse and stir,
Could make you rob your cheated wife
Of wdmt you’d given her.
“Adultery is trivial:
And faith —ah, what’s a word?” you said.
Most loved and most illogical.
Words are your daily bread!
Your bread, your wine. And I, so cold,
So miserly of love, at least
Have given you words that you may hold
In drought-time for a feast!

THE LOOTING OF LONDON.
Bluchee said hungrily that London would
bo a tine city to loot, and the same idea was
more or less in the mind of a large part of
the Clumsy M'acdonald Government and
party. It is certain that it was and is very
definitely in the mind of the Communist sec-
tion ; and that section hopes to run the party
one of these days, knowing that, when revolu-
tion is in progress, the most violent scoun-
drels come to the top and stay awhile. Be-
cause of the election results the looting is,
however, either off or postponed—probably the
latter, for the world's financial centre is a
far more promising place to sack than it
was in Bluciiee’s day, and with the growth
of Communism the craze for sacking places
has expanded marvellously. Even Clumsy
Macdonald himself proposed to plunder the
city and the island at large in a polite way
by partial repudiation of the public debt
and other forms of his proposed “levy on
capital,” and presumably he still keeps this
idea in view for his next term of office. It is
probable that the partial repudiation of the
public debt, by seizure of a slice of any big
fortunes which happen to be represented by
Government bonds, would be the one success-
ful feature of a levy on capital. The annexa-
tion and realisation of half a big landed
estate, even that of the tremendous duke
whose bit of the surface of London is valued
at a casual ten millions, might produce most
disappointing results; for the property would
yield only (1) as much as local buyers who
liarl just lost a good part of their own assets
in the levy could afford to pay, or (2) as
much as foreign buyers who hadn't been
newly robbed, and local ones who had, cared
to give for a title-deed which might be levied
upon again at any moment now that the
habit had begun. And the same rules would
apply to the seizure and sale of shares and
interests in every going concern. But if a
bloated capitalist possessed £lOO,OOO of Gov-
ernment funds and his spasmodic contribu-
tion was fixed at £30,000, he could be col-
lected from in full by simply cancelling all
but £70,000 of his holdings. It might easily
happen that this one brilliant result would
incite to further collections from the same
easy source till there would remain no debt
at all. However, this is a divergence.
* * # •
More advanced Ramsayites desire to loot
London and the rest of Britain in the
wholesale or Communist or Bolshevik style,
and regard it as waste of time to break the
news by a mere “levy.” The Bolshevik de-
velopment, though it was very sudden at the
last, went through various stages. There
was a fatuous, but more or less authorised,
Provisional Government sitting in a big
building and issuing laws; and in the same
building sat, on its own initiative, a local
gathering of soldiers, strikers and sundries
which paid no rent for its accommodation,
and an amateur and Unprovisional Govern-
ment which also issued laws. The Provi-
sional Government originated the idea of
transferring the real control of the army
to soldiers’ committees. The agents of the
Unprovisional Government permeated the
committees, and extended their powers to the
crucifixion, flogging and dismissal of officers.
So the army gave up fighting and likewise
washing, and spent its days in receiving
visits from eloquent Huns who preached
brotherhood, or in visiting the Hun camp
to receive lessons in brotherhood. The
“slogan” in those piping days of repose on
the front was “Peace without annexations
and without indemnities,” though when Rus-
sia's reformed army left for home the annexa-
tions made at the country’s expense included
half a million square miles and 65,000,000
inhabitants, and the indemnity was so huge
that the first (and last) instalment ran to
£300,000,000 of good money and bad. It
was before the annexations and the indem-
nity that the Unprovisional Government
chased the Provisional Government off the
premises and made the universal levy on
capital. It arrived in one act at the point
which the Macdonalds of Great Britain
hope to attain by degrees. It looted the
cities by taking them over bodily, with con-
tents. It took everything from everybody,
who consequently lost it, and it gave every-
thing to everybody, who somehow didn't seem
to get it. Everybody possessed the country,
and in like manner the population of Aus-
tralia possesses the railways, and is accused
of trespass if it walks on its property. lit
fact, all things were put into the hands of
trustees, like the estate of a rich lunatic
in the charge of solicitors who present no
accounts. The prime trusteeship lies with
a sort of permanent Soviet of Commissaries,
which was found waiting when the regime
started, and which is supposed to appoint
new members of _its own body as vacancies
occur, and with a complicated collection of
elective bodies which get together on mixed
principles and amount to nothing -when as-
sembled. Some of these remarks arc like-
wise irrelevant; but it is difficult to keep
the hair of this subject rigidly shingled.
* * * m
The idea of looting London on these lines
appeals strongly to those who assume, that
they are fairly certain of places on the Board
which will administer the lunatic’s estate.
(So does the idea of looting Australia gen-
erally ; and the large number and small qual-
ity of the people who have pegged out their
seats on the Board in advance is surprising.)
The more energetic Macdonalds profess to
be positive that the recent disaster is only
temporary. The party is to come back
like a lion refreshed with new wine, no
longer dependent on the Liberal gang, which
is to vanish out of politics, the stuffy rem-
nant taking to its natural occupations of
passing the collection-plate, or presiding at
mothers’ meetings, or teaching in female
academies. Then the franchise is to be
refixed so as to ensure a certain permanency
of office to the Macdonalds, and after a
large measure of disarmament and the weed-
ing of weak and cold-footed brethren out of
the Cabinet the good work of taking every-
thing from everybody and giving all things
to all people is to commence on sound Com-
munist principles. There is, of course, always
a chance that in a disarmed country the plain
criminal class may get in first. In other
words, there may be a looting of London on
old mediaeval principles which wall forestall
well-laid plans and nicely-spun theories.
Many persons who call themselves Commu-
nists to go on with would much prefer a
private enterprise, go-as-you-please, catch-
as-catch-can sack of the world’s richest city
to the more or less orderly transfer of ail
wealth to the kind of trustees who take
everything and give back nothing save orders,
decrees and axioms. It is 144 years since the
last sacking of London, when the Maypole
Inn Avas wrecked, and the hangman was
hanged, and Miggs lost her job, and Simon
Tapperttt lost his legs, and Barnaby’s
raven lost its voice: but though tremendous
damage was done in six days of turmoil,
weak leadership and military interference
caused the A\-ork to be left unfinished. It
may soon be due to resume. With a huge
alien population, and a “pacified” ax-my, and
a Government which is afraid to shoot its
majority, very unpleasant events may happen
to the city of Babylon Junior. It is merely
a matter of letting some things drift on:
merely a matter of some politicians encourag-
ing the mob to believe in the possibility of
the impossible and to shut its collective
eye to hard and unpleasant facts; merely a
matter of other ignorant or mischievous
politicians confirming the mob in its errors.
“THE TEACUPS OF GENEVA.”
This is how William Mcßeath, one of the
Australian delegates to the League of
Nations Conference, recently described the
mechanism of the outfit for manufacturing
peace' which the Powers have installed at
Geneva. The real work, he stated, was not
done, at the conference at all, but at the
meetings of the commissions appointed by
the conference, the decisions arrived at by
the sub-bodies being controlled largely by the
influence brought to bear on the members
at the dinners and other social functions held
continuously by the astute statesmen of the
several nations. The cableman, who is an
unsophisticated chap, described this as a “sur-
prising story" ; but there is nothing in the
least surprising about it. The same sort of
thing has happened at every international
gathering of which we have any record. The
Versailles Conference was a recent example.
Mi\ Mcßeath did us the further service of
describing the lavish entertaining done by the
Japanese, who were almost the strongest
delegation there. “If Australians are
to obtain inside knowledge of things,” he
remarked, “they must be prepared to
spend more money at Geneva.” About the
time this interesting sidelight was thrown
on the domestic economy of the League, the
text of the new protocol arrived here. This
document is the production presumably of
the duchesses and shingled typistes who pre-
sided over the teacups at Geneva, and the
question of ratifying it is to be discussed
by the Federal Parliament next January.
* * * *
The part of the protocol which has most
pregnancy for Australia is Article 5
If in the course of an arbitration one of the parties
claims that the dispute or part of it relates to a
matter which by international law is solely within
the domestic jurisdiction of that party, the arbitra-
tors are bound to consult on this question the Per-
ißanent Court of International Justice. If the Court
replies that the matter is of such a nature, the
decision of the arbitrators must be limited to a
declaration to that effect.
This is the Article about which Japan made
all the fuss and which was eventually altered
to its present form to soothe her feelings,
severely ruffled by the rejection of a more
drastic amendment presented by her repre-
sentatives. In its present form the Article
makes no fundamental change in Australia’s
position with regard to domestic jurisdic-
tion. Under Article 15 of the original Cov-
enant, the Council of the League is empow-
ered to consider the merits of a claim by any
party that a dispute arises out of a matter
of domestic or back-yard concern. The
objectionable feature of the new proposal
from Australia’s viewpoint is that, after the
Council, in an atmosphere of geishas,
duchesses, popping champagne-corks and
midnight suppers, has discussed the merits
of a dispute without getting the disputants
into a tolerant frame of mind, it must refer
the matter to a committee of arbitrators. If
during the arbitral proceedings (fortified by
the customary round of dinners, dances, after-
noon teas and evening parties on the lake)
one of the disputants claims that the matter
is of purely domestic interest, the whole
contraption of duchesses, geishas, etc., must
be transferred to the Hague, where the
is to be repeated at a session of the Perma-*
ncnt Court. Apart from the financial strain
involved (according to Mr. Mcßeath the
Commonwealth’s expenditure of £BO,OOO
annually leaves the Australian delegates as
obscure outsiders looking hungrily at the
illuminations through the doorway), Aus-
tralia cannot afford to have her pet domes-
tic claim given all this expensive publicity.
She holds the vastest expanse of untenanted
fertile country in the world, and she claims
the right to exclude from it immi-
grants from the most overcrowded lands
of the earth. It is not a case that
would earn much sympathy, even of
the postprandial variety, from Europe.
That continent is stated to be over-populated
to the extent of 15 millions at the present
moment, and Australia might be asked an
awkward question—why she claims from
Europe consideration for her All White
policy while her trades-unions, for whose
protection in great part the policy is framed,
put every obstacle in the way of absorbing
some of Europe’s human surplus. She might
be asked, too, what her statesmen have been
doing of late to utilise her inheritance for the
good of man. It is not inconceivable, under the
circumstances, that the verdict would go
against her; for a nolicy which leaves mil-
lions of acres empty in one country while
people in other countries are fighting for
mere standing room is a policy which liaS
grave consequences, international as well as
domestic. In which case Australia would
doubtless be asked by the Council to modify
her exclusion laws, and on her refusal she
would presumably become an aggressor if
she went to war to defend her shores from
an Asiatic influx.
* * * »
However remote this last contingency may
be, until Australia has justified her monopoly
of this vast continent by populating it with
white people, she would be well advised to
avoid, in every possible way, discussion of
her claim either in public or over the tea-
cups.
A ROMANCE OF SEA WARFARE.
TrrE tenth anniversary of Australia’s first
naval action fell last week. It reminded
us that even in a war of steel and gold
romance still lingers. It is not the romance
of battle: human valor is antlike under the
tread of the forces it pretends to control. The
romance of modern sea-fights is in the ether,
and the record of it is largely in the log-
books of wireless operators. When Nelson
was blockading Villeneuve at Toulon he had
been five months without word from Eng-
land ; at Electra House, on Finsbury Pave-
ment, the nerve-centre of the Empire, they
knew of the arrival of the Emden off Cocos
atoll before she had time to land a crew.
It is a thrilling story, with which Aus-
tralians had a great deal to do. They were
Australian fingers that sent out the call that
brought the Australian cruiser to the rescue.
The Australian armada of 38 great vessels
was steaming at 10 knots and three abreast
towards Colombo, and was only 45 miles
distant at the time. If the Emden had suc-
ceeded in wrecking Cocos and getting away,
Australian cities would probably have
known what enemy bombardment means;
and if the redoubtable Yon Muller had
sighted the convoy crammed with Austra-
lian troops and horses, there is little doubt
what he would have tried to do. “If I had
got up to you,” he said later, when a pri-
soner on an Australian troopship, “I should
have run alongside her”—indicating the
cruiser on the port bow of the convoy—“and
fired a torpedo. Then, in the confusion, I
should have got in among the transports. I
would have sunk half of them, I think,
before your escort came up. I should have
been sunk in the end, I expect—l always
expected that.” Nobody reading the story
of his previous exploits could doubt that
he would have made the attempt. Up to
the Cocos. fiasco he had seemed to bear a
charmed life. A month before he had put
into Simalur Island, in the Sumatra chain,
to coal from his tender. H.M.S. Hampshire
had been searching the same island in quest
of the Konigsberg the day before. The
next day they crossed each other’s track
with only the skyline between them; the
Emden was thus able to slip into the Indian
Ocean, while her enemy went on to search
Java. A few days later Yon Muller set
a course for Rangoon Bay, precisely the
spot to which Captain Cochrane in the
Yarmouth had been ordered in search of
him. On September IS the Emden trans-
ferred the crew of her last prize to the
Dovre, a Norwegian ship, 24 miles south-
east of the Rangoon River. The Indian
Government had been amiably broadcasting
messages to his pursuers in plain language,
and from these he learnt that the su:«ound-
ihg seas were full of them. lie made
off, . once more crossing the Hamp-
shire's bows just far enough away not to
be seen. On September L’2 he shelled the
oil-tanks at Madras, escaping by three hours
the Hampshire and the Chikuma, which closed
together almost in his wake. His colliers
had been captured, and lie was nearly out
of coal; so he ran for Diego Garcia, a lonely
little island where Orient liners used to
coal before the war. The tiny British garri-
son received him with open arms, gave him
every facility to careen, clean and coal his
vessel, and after a round of mutual cour-
tesies cheered him on his way. Five days
later Captain Grant in the Hampshire
hurried in to the settlement with the news
that Britain had been at war with Ger-
many for three months, and that they had
been entertaining an enemy.
After capturing six more merchantmen,
including a collier with 6000 tons of Welsh
coal aboard, Von Muller stood away for
the latitude of Colombo. As he approached,
the Hampshire and the converted Empress
of Asia were making a sweep toward Felidu
Atoll, which must have brought them across
the JEmden’s track. At midnight it looked
"as if nothing could save her. Von Muller
was worried about his train of prizes, whose
speed was only 9£ knots. But their sloth
saved him. Like the hero of a Northern
folk-tale, he passed in a rainstorm 10 miles
astern of his pursuers. On October 2S.
with a dummy fourth funnel, lie steamed
through Penang Harbor, which is a narrow,
crowded channel between the island and the
mainland. He torpedoed and sank the Rus-
sian cruiser Zliemchug and the French de-
stroyer Mousquet, while most of the officers
of both ships looked on astounded from the
verandah of the Penang Club ashore.
And now he conceived the idea of raiding
Cocos, the nerve-centre of the Indian Ocean.
The train of his pursuers by this time in-
cluded the Hampshire, Yarmouth, Empress
of Asia, Weymouth, Dartmouth, Gloucester
and Askold, and all the Japanese squad-
rons not engaged against Von Seek ; and,
unknown to Von Muller, the huge Aus-
tralian convoy was creeping across the In-
dian Ocean. In his dash for Cocos he
crossed its course at a distance of 250 miles.
During the night of November S it had
passed within 40 miles of the atoll, and at
dawn on the Otli it was about 45 miles
north of Cocos when the Emden with her
dummy funnel steamed into sight of the island.
Von Muller had a landing party ready:
but before they had left the ship’s side the
SOS signal was pouring out from the island
aerial, and the underwater cables were
throbbing with the news. Von Muller
had put his head into a hornet’s nest. Cap-
tain Silver, of the Melbourne, was the first
to pick up the SOS from Cocos, and he
swung his ship round to> go off to the rescue.
Immediately remembering it was the Mel-
bourne’s duty as flagship to stay with the
convoy, he reluctantly tossed the order on
to the Sydney. After the Sydney had dis-
appeared the Japanese Ibuka made the ges-
ture that lie wanted to follow, but was
ordered to remain. Meantime the Emden’s
landing party had dashed ashore at Cocos,
wrecked the cable station, blown up the
wireless mast and was busy locking the
stable-door after the horse had escaped, by
sawing through the cables. To the secret
delight of the staff the landing party wasted
time severing spare shore ends that ran
only a few hundred yards out to sea. It
had succeeded in cutting through only the
Perth cable when smoke was seen on the
skyline, and simultaneously the Emden
sounded the recall. But Von Muller
could not wait for the shore party. In a
few moments the Emden was fleeing for her
life, with the Sydney tearing in her wake.
Members of the cable staff who subsequently
visited North Keeling, where the Emden
left her bones, tell gruesome ,storiies bf
wounded German sailors climbing painfully
out of the surf over the ragged reefs, only
to fall victims to the huge land crabs which
swarm in the secondary jungle of the island.
Von Muller ended his odyssey as a pri-
soner of war on the Orvieto, on which was
General Bridges, the Australian comman-
der ; but Von Mugge, the lieutenant who
had commanded the Cocos raiding party,
added an epilogue which is not so well
known. As soon as he saw that the issue
of the Syduey-Emden battle was not in
doubt, Von Mugge seized the Ayeslia, a
40-ton schooner belonging to Governor
Ross, the owner of the atoll. Victualling
his capture with a good half of the cable
co.’s stores, and with his landing party
numbering 50 on board, he sailed out of the
lagoon and over the rim of the blue sea
like a thoroughly conventional buccaneer.
Their ship was ill-found and leaky, and just
as it was sinking under their feet they fell
in with a British steamer, which they cap-
tured, and in which they made for Arabia.
They were the first Europeans to enter the
Iledjaz during the war. They w r ere be-
leaguered by hostile Arabs for three days
and two nights, till their water failed and
their dead camels poisoned the air; but they
got through, and Princess Blttciier records
how she met Von Mugge in June, 3915. at
a hotel in Dresden, where he was treated as
a hero and followed wherever he went by
admiring crowds.
An obscure but useful part was played
by the staff on Cocos Island. As soon as
the raiding party had disappeared they dug


up fresh instruments which had been secretly
buried in expectation of just such an event-
uality as this. The broken cables were
temporarily linked across the bows of an
anchored whaleboat, fresh batteries were
made up, and within 24 hours the cable
traffic, essential to Australia’s full partici-
pation in the war, resumed its flow.
M.G.S.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Britain’s Yes-No.
The British Conservative party is in the
position of the man whose tender has been
accepted for a job, and who remembers with
bitterness that his tools are in pawn.
Although at the previous election the Free-
trade Liberals had a bad time and the Labor
gains were due to causes which had no rela-
tion to the tariff, the Baldwin party was
foolish enough to voluntarily surrender its
chance of doing a great thing for the nation.
Instead of standing to its guns and attempt-
ing to honestly educate public opinion on
the only vital issue in its programme, the
leaders of the party shirked, side-stepped and
let their great opportunity go. They have
scored a victory, certainly, but there is no
reason for supposing that their victory would
have been in any way less notable if they
had been true to their convictions. As it
is. with the Labor advance checked, the
Liberal party wiped out and the votes of
the country solidly behind them, the Conser-
vatives stand with their hands tied to face
five years of something like futility. No-
thing seems, more certain than that that
period—possibly shortened by some of the
usual changes and chances—will end in dis-
aster. Under a Freetrade blight the Con-
servative rule can scarcely fail to have an
increasing burden of unemployment on its
shoulders; and its vague intention of doing
something for British agriculture is not likely
to carry it to any great heights of popularity.
The result will be a strong reaction in favor
of Labor, which, under pressure of circum-
stances, may indeed take up the running
where the Baldwinites left it and adopt a
Protectionist policy. Should Labor do this
all the old futilities of the Manchester school
will try to get shelter under the Conserva-
tive banner; and a party that once bargains
away its best assets for a chance of nominal
victory can generally be counted upon to do
something foolish the next time. Baldwin’s
road out would be a re-assertion of his Pro-
tectionist faith and a further appeal to the
country in a few months; but that would
require courage, and of courage the party
seems to have very little to spare.
♦—
America Too.
Six days after Baldwin’s triumph in
Britain Calvin Coolidge, Republican Presi-
dent of the U.S.A. since Harding’s death
last year, was chosen for another term by
the greatest majority ever recorded at a Pre-
sidential election. Of 30,000,000 votes polled
Coolidge got 18,000,000, Davis, the Demo-
crat, 8,000,000, and La Follette, the Pro-
gressive or Farmer-Laborite, 4,000,000. The
Republican candidate carried every State
except Wisconsin, which is La Follette’s
stronghold, and “the solid South,” which has
been constant to the Democratic party ever
since the Civil War. And although a pre-
ponderance) of votes in the Electoral College
doesn’t necessarily imply a Congressional vic-
tory, Coolidge will have good majorities in
the Senate and the House of Representa-
tives —hitherto a worry to him—for the next
two years at least. The Republican party is
the American counterpart of Baldwin’s,
and their successes are obviously related.
They are attributable to a general mistrust
of crude socialistic schemes, of Russian in-
trigues and Geneva manoeuvres, to a weari-
ness of copperheads, “conchies” and idiots
who praise with enthusiastic tone every
country but their own, and to a longing for
the leadership of safe men of fine character,
whose patriotism is above suspicion—such
leaders, in short, as Coolidge and Baldavin.
The Democratic candidate would have led
his country into the League of Nations, and
the Americans are justly suspicious of that
body, especially since the disarmament pro-
tocol was published. La Follette had great
plans for Government ownership, which has
proved a failure in the U.S.A. wherever tried,
for making the Constitution alterable at the
caprice of Congress (a proposal abhorrent to
a| country with bitter memories of the seces-
sionists) and for recognising and lending vast
sums to the Soviet Republic. But America
is fed up with the Soviet Republic. In its
relations with the bloodstained institution
it has got nothing but insults, ingrati-
tude, strikes, sedition and theft. When
Woodrow Wilson offered the Moscow ruf-
fians the hand of friendship he was met with
the reply that they spurned it and would
spit on it if they could. Millions lent to
the Kerensky Government for the prosecu-
tion of the war were stolen by the Bolshe-
vists and applied in part to propaganda
aimed at the overthrow of American insti-
tutions. This propaganda went on unceas-
ingly even while America, helped by Britain,
was. succoring the victims of the Bolshevist
famine and pestilence. Behind La Fol-
lette stood the entire rabble of Communists,
Socialists, Internationalists and Pacifists —
both the cold-footed variety and the roating
sort that demanded peace when the country
was at war, and clamors for war at home
now there is peace abroad—as well as the
hyphenated Americans who advocate low-
class immigration, the more the merrier.
Uncle Samuel declares in the plainest way,
even as J. Bull did the week before, that
these remarkable people are not going to run
his country. Each nation has registered an
emphatic verdict in favor of sound national-
ism and ordered progress. What choice Aus-
tralia will make when its time comes remains
to be seen. This Commonwealth has
acquired a party which, while it professes
to have repudiated Communism, allows Com-
munists to run its newspapers, acquiesces in
mad Communist strikes, and shows in nearly
every line of its policy—even in the jargon
in which that policy is written—that it re-
gards Moscow as its spiritual home. The
electors have been very patient with this
vaporing party, but patience is a virtue which
can be overdone.
Admitting a Failure.
The general attack organised by various
grumpy union bosses on the Commonwealth
shipping line, following on more previous
attacks than it is easy to remember, should
definitely decide the Government to sell that
gigantic money-loser and eternal bone ot
contention, and build a _ transcontinental
standard-gauge railway with the savings.
The railway is urgently wanted, and would
fill a need. The Commonwealth line appa-
rently isn’t wanted even by the unions which
extract high pay and easy conditions out of
it, for the mere sight of a Commonwealth
ship moves them to fury and a strike of
some sort, and it fills no visible need, for the
vessels are too few to make any difference
or to meet any emergency. No one has the
faintest hope that the Government will be
able to extract better service for less money,
so increasing the fleet to a point at which its
existence will be worth while will only mean
greater losses and more strikes. At a recent
date the management had three distinct
troubles on hand. To begin with it had a
chartered vessel held up at Fremantle on
general principles. At the same time its
newest cargo ship wasn't able to get to sea
for want of a crew. The plea in that
case was that some of the men whom
it was proposed to employ were not
unionists because they had been suspended
from the union for doing a perfectly legal
act; of the Court’s decision that the
suspension was unlawful and of no effect,
the union bosses, being above the law, took
no notice at all. The third hold-up was in
defence of the right of the stewards to refuse
duty at sea, and it was held that they should
be assured of further employment so that
there might be no doubt about the matter.
The point of order was that it is the business
of stewards to wait on passengers, and that
when two developed signs of being “dippy”
(quite a frequent happening at sea) they
still had to be waited on by somebody—or
else be thrown overboard. It was little more
than a half-filled ship; nevertheless, though
there were thus twice as many stewards as
the case called for, the work of supervising
the lunatics who couldn’t be thrown over-
board fell on passengers. The management
having apparently lost almost all the little
control it once had over its ships, the time
for getting out appears to have really arrived;
for though servile souls may put up with
much humiliation for a profit, it is a very
absurd soul which goes out of its way to b?
dragged through the dust for a loss. Some
of the decisions arrived at by the recent
Labor Conference are especially suggestive
of urgency. One concerned the more vigor-
ous enforcement of the Navigation Act. An-
other demanded, in a general way, the ex-
tension of the Commonwealth line, and that
it shall be “kept independent of the ship-
ping combine.” If these words mean that
Labor-in-oflice proposes to start a war of
rates with the public money, the gentle art
of making losses may expand indefinitely,
and the words seem to imply something of
the sort. Further, it was resolved that “mail
contracts at present held by private ship-
ping companies be in future let to the Com-
monwealth line.” That implies very few
mails or very many Commonwealth ships,
and the latter, which is more probable, isn’t
a cheering prospect. Therefore it might
be well if, when Labor comes into office,
there was no Commonwealth line to
experiment with. Should the party
create a new one it at least couldn’t
explain away its losses, if any, by
saying that it took over a decayed con-
cern. If the Commonwealth shipping service
had had any luck in making the North and
North-West available for settlement, a great
many things might be overlooked; but the
John Alee grows no bigger, and the Hudders-
field grows slower, and other ships desert
the northern seas, and no good thing
happens. Evidently the empty region must be
approached by land, like the camp of the
hypothetical niggers who have the presump-
tive castaways of the Douglas Mawson in
custody. Wherefore the proposition is reiter-
ated that the Federal Government should
go out of a marine business of which it appa-
rently knows nothing and is learning nothing,
and spend the money on railway building, at
wdiich it really has achieved a trifle of success.

Absurdities of the Parliamentary
System.
The poisonous crew who aim at destroying
Parliamentary government in Australia need
never go short of material for invective. They
can find an inexhaustible supply in the pro-
ceedings of those charged with the mainten-
ance of the institution, which proceedings,
as recorded in Hansard and the.daily news-
papers or studied on the spot, inspire the
Communist with hope and reduce the Con-
stitutionalist to despair. And whether the
Parliament is State or Federal, and the Gov-
ernment Liberal, Labor or Nationalist-
Country party, the methods are much thc-
same. Members assemble for their year’s
“work” in midwinter, or perhaps early
Spring, and adjourn before the warm weather
sets in. Five or six weeks are wasted in
silly debates on the address-in-rqply, on
hopeless no-confidence motions and on formal
motions for the adjournment of the House
to consider the smallest of small beer. Then
what is called “the business of the session”
is brought on. To a large extent it consists
of measures which are introduced with the
formula, “This bill is an amendment of the
one passed last year,” and which are rushed
into law so recklessly that further “amend-
ments” become inevitable. There is so much
legislation of this variety, and others just as
stupid, that it is nothing out of the way for
50 bills to be passed in a three or four
months’ session; and towards the end of
things, when the process of manufacture is
accelerated, acts are shoved on the Statute
Book at the rate of three or four per sit-
ting. And at every sitting there is a plague
of questions, many of which are inspired by
muckraking newspapers on the implied under-
standing that puff-paragraphs will be the
reward of members who draw attention to
their vamped-up “sensations,” and which
are answered at considerable expense, large
bodies of civil servants furnishing the fre-
quently useless information at overtime rates.
When the Government is satisfied that a
sufficient number of bills has been shot out
of the legislative mill, the honorable gentle-
men, red-eyed and jaded as a result of un-
necessary all-night sittings, exchange more
or less hypocritical compliments and go for
their eight or nine months’ holiday. And,
saying the destroyers and muckrakers afore-
said, everyone is glad to see them go. On
October 7, while the House of Reps, was
wrestling with the contract (which was com-
pleted after a fashion) of putting through 21
bills in three days, five honorable members
rose in their places to support a formal
motion for adjournment “to discuss a de-
finite matter of urgent public importance.”
to wit, the blue-papering of a Ballarat
trainee who was four hours short in his
drill; and the rights and wrongs of this
momentous incident were thrashed out at
length. On August 13 the N. S. Wales
Assembly met, as usual, at 4.30 p.m. and
kept Ministers answering questions (82, no
less!) until the dinner adjournment at 6.30.
Resuming at 7.45 it discussed a Federal
matter for two hours and a half on a formal
motion for adjournment—at least, two hours
were devoted to the Federal matter and half
an hour to the incidental question of whe-
ther it was in keeping with the high tradi-
tions of the N. S. Wales Parliament for one
gentleman to call another a liar—and went
on to Government business for three-quarters
of an hour, whereupon it adjourned for the
night. That ivas one day’s “work,” and
there are many such days. It is by no
means unusual for N. S. Wales Ministers
to put in the whole afternoon replying to
questions, most of which are designed merely
to advertise the interrogator and those who
prompt him, and a large proportion are the
veriest piffle. In a really well-ordered Par-
liament all questions would be referred to
a committee with power to reject those of
no public importance, and the formal-motion-
for-adjournnjent tomfoolery would be abol-
ished in favor of a statement of the alleged
grievance in Hansard; also, an end would
be made of that antiquated privilege (useful
in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
but an abomination nowadays) which per-
mits political ruffians to publish venomous
libels on private citizens without fear of
consequences.

Labor’s Lost Chances.
“What fools Australians are! We have the greatest
wealth-producing asset, our wool trade, and yet we
allow it to be exploited by countries overseas. When
shall we wake up and haye sense enough to tell the
world ‘lf you want our wool you can get it on our
terms ; and our terms are that we will not allow our
wool to be exported in the grease’ ?.. .If this the first
sound principle that should govern the policy of our
country with regard to the export of our primary
products were adopted, there would not be a man
unemployed in the Commonwealth. Instead, we find
millions of pounds’ worth of machinery lying idle and
thousands of skilled workers unemployed and seeking
relief for their families, in the Botany district alone,
all because the Commonwealth Government thinks
more with the mind of the importer than of the
Australian manufacturer.”
That statement was made by Tom Mutch,
M.L.A., late N.S.W. Minister for Education,
and looks not only healthy but something
like a real conversion. Mutcii definitely
asserts the Protectionist position as
the first sound principle of a national
policy; yet he himself belongs to a party
which has for years agreed to sink that issue
as if it were a matter of no importance.
The question naturally arises whether a man
can definitely state that he regards a matter
as of first importance, and then allow it to
drift entirely into the background of his
political thought, without losing all driving
power he ever possessed. The whole loss
of grip of the Labor party during the last
15 or 20 years might be traced to this very
cause—this failure to come to holts with
practical issues. In the original Labor party
there Avas beyond doubt a solid majority for
high Protection, but this majority compro-
mised with a minority, of which W. M.
Hughes was the outstanding figure. They
did not sink the tariff question all at once, as
did some of their opponents, but at first par-
tially submerged it in talk of “New Protec-
tion.” New Protection was simply Old Pro-
tection with a demand for a guarantee that
some portion of the additional industrial
profits should go to the workers in the pro-
tected industry—a position which every Old
Protectionist was perfectly willing to grant,
and which, in fact, with the machinery of
the Arbitration Court, was guaranteed
already. But all the talk of New Protec-
tion swiftly died down without any serious
attempt being made by Labor when in power
to translate it into action. Then the war
came with other cries, and a general re-
shuffle of parties; and the changed Labor
which emerged was too much concerned with
expulsions and strikes and faked ballot-
boxes and misty polysyllables to remember
that the same W. M. Hughes who had be-
come its chief enemy had in former years
been the chief cause of its neglect to formu-
late a sound Australian policy. Now it is
just possible that, with closing factories, idle
men and machinery and nothing the least
attractive in the way of a national policy
to put before the country, Labor men are
feeling for a footing on the old track which
they once refused to tread. Certainly if the
first plank of the Federal Labor platform
were that which Tom Mutcii has declared
to he the first sound principle of national
government, most of the fear of Bolshevism
would fade away and the party would get
a serious hearing.

An Argument About a Hat.
Unconscious humor is a conspicuous fea-
ture of the debates which grace the marble
palace in Wellington (M.L.) where Wil-
liam: Massey rules. The recent discussion
on the Gaming Amendment Bill, which
proposes to sanction 31 new totalisa-
tor licenses, furnished some excellent
examples. The proposal met with oppo-
sition on moral grounds from vari-
ous individual members, and on political
grounds from the Labor party, which is in
that condition of grouching recalcitrancy
that it would oppose the monumental Massey
if he tried to pass a measure imposing
Marxian socialism on the State. The stone-
walling of the Labor members all day found
the amendment still in suspense by night-
fall. and when the division was called one
McCombs, member for Lyttelton, challenged
and said that he had called for a division
on another amendment. Under the standing
orders anyone speaking after the doors are
locked must do so seated and covered. Hav-
ing no hat, he held an order-paper over his
head. Smith, of Taranaki, having secured a
cap from somewhere, and, therefore, being
more legitimately placed than McCombs,
raised the point that the latter legislator
was not covered under the terms of the regu-
lation by his improvised headgear. An acri-
monious debate then ensued as to whether a
scrap of paper can constitute a hat. The
Labor members eventually withdrew to Bet-
lamy’s—a very good place to withdraw to,
too—and refused to vote; so that the new
clause was adopted by the biggest majority
the spherical Farmer has had for many a
day. The cities of Maoriland swarm with
illegal betting-shops, and the facilities pro-
vided for laying a dollar on Also Ban are
at least as good as those for obtaining a cup
of. tea. The subtle, questioning gleam that
brightens the eye of the tobacconist as he
deals out cigarettes and matches tells its own
tale to those who want to read. The pro-
posal to oppose this surreptitious business by
extending the legalised system on which the
Government may keep an eye is a sound one
and merits support, most of all from Labor,
which suffers more than any other class
from the buccaneers of gambling.
The Doubtful White Man.
Northern Queensland, where the Australian
sentiment runs deep, has made its own classi-
fication and calls the people of the Medi-
terranean littoral black. This is, of course,
not fair; for types exactly similar to those
of the Northern races are found in Spain,
Italy and the Balkans. But the racial his-
tory of the Mediterranean lands gives great
support to the Queensland view. Spain, with
a basis of Celto-Iberian, filled with black
slaves under both Carthaginian and Roman
rule, and was afterwards in the hands of
the Moor, who, discolored himself, brought in
persons of every shade to do his work. Rome
and Greece kept slaves to an extent which
was far beyond their needs; and while many
of these were European, many more were of
all the colors of the duststorm. When an-
cient civilisation broke down, black, brown
and white were all thrown together into one
racial tangle; and the northern invasions
were too short in their duration and too in-
effective in their grip to do much towards
altering the general color-scheme except in
favored districts. In the Balkans matters
were intensified by later inroads and perma-
nent settlements of Asiatic tribes, but modi-
fied by the downward surge of the white
Serbs. In the circumstances it is not sur-
prising to find almost pure negro types
among people who in the general European
summary are called white; and there is no
bar in Australian law to the entrance of
any number of such people. Yet to accept
them in countless thousands —as we might
very easily be asked to do —would be to
entirely violate the spirit on which our
white Commonwealth is built. The remark-
able persistence of some of the black types
through dozens of centuries shows that the
white races cannot really absorb them; and
the intellectual standard follows with much
exactitude the racial type. It is the latter
point that may help us to find a road out
of what might grow to be a serious diffi-
culty. In seeking population Australia does
not want people who might remain among
us for 50 generations as mere beasts of bur-
den ; and it may become necessary to enor-
mously increase the educational tests of those
who seek entrance.
A Communist Paradise.
“M.G.S.”: Tite Communists’ plans and
specifications for the millennium include the
nationalisation of mines, railways, indus-
tries, lands and banks. A consideration of
the social conditions in Java might be pro-
fitable in this connection, because most of
these desiderata have existed in the crowded
island to the north of us for a long time
without producing more millennium than
could be comfortably held in the hand. In
fact, the atap-roofed homes of the Javanese
Communists reveal a state of affairs that
would be intolerable to the individualistic
British worker. It can hardly be the fault of
the soil, for what with central (volcanic)
heating, automatic fertilisation and an
almost perfect system of irrigation, the soil
of Java is probably the richest in the world.
It can’t be slackness, for the family of a
Javanese Communist works up to the waist
in the communal mud of the ricefields from
6 in the morning till 1, and probably again
in the afternoon; the children work from
the day they can toddle; the women spend
their spare time working for their neigh-
bors ; and even then, although they reap two
and even three harvests a year from the
same patch of ground, they earn only about
£2 10s. per annum, under the best condi-
tions, and 10s. under the worst, which is
not enough to supply their Communistic
stomachs with the usual two meals a day
all the year round, and would make a Bri-
tish worker think he was on a hunger strike.
Inquiries I made in the Communal schools
elicited the fact that 14 out of 20 children
attending had not eaten before leaving their
homes, although some of them had to walk
several miles. Half the students had only
one suit to their communal backs, and on
returning home all must work from 3 p.m.
till dark. The usual diet of the Communist
is a little rice, salt and vegetable, varied
in bad times, when the millennium gets tem-
porarily misplaced, by fish, Indian corn and
cassava, which is the sort of dish the down-
trodden British individualist usually feeds
to the fowls. Although the land is owned
by the State, there is not enough to go round,
and there is as big a proportion of landless
workers as in Britain: and their condition
is considerably worse. The munumpang,
which is Javanese for proletariat, pays for
the rent of his 6ft. by 6ft. bamboo palace
in work, and as he has anything from 7 to
10 children he is usually in debt, and thus
becomes a bond slave to his landlord. His
wife cuts the rice harvest of the landed
Communists, receiving one bundle of rice,
enough for half a day’s food, for each 10
bundles picked: she can earn two bundles
in a day if she keeps at it long enough, but
she only earns in harvest-time ; the rest of
the year the family goes hungrier than usual,
though to the credit of the Communists it
should be said that adults always see that
the children are fed first. ■ The girls who
paint the lovely designs on the sarongs so
popular with white ladies as opera-cloaks
work from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m., then sleep
till 5 a.m. and work again from 5 a.m. to
3 p.m.: this elysian existence earns them
eightpence a day. Lest it be argued that
their wants are few and the cost of living
low, it is necessary to add that the minimum
required in Java to keep body and soul to-

The Ideal Excellence
Owners of Smith & Waddington bodies enjoy a. unique; pleasure, for, mingled
with the thrill of motoring, is the ever-present feeling of real appreciation of
perfect comfort and distinctive smartness. Deep, full-toned finish, broad, inviting,
restful seats. rich upholstery and unstinted excellence of detail indicate the final
perfection of body-building achieved by Smith & Waddington.
The Smith & Waddington De Luxe Bodies
are the ideal of Character. Beauty and Durability. They win instantaneous
admiration everywhere, and their high re-sale value, distinctive smartness and
luxurious comfort make them a most valuable and practical investment for
discerning motorists.

gether is 10 guilders a month; the average
earnings being eight, there is a discrepancy
of two, which is covered by the usual device
of taking up the loincloth a couple of holes.
The fact that the Communists have con-
centrated their efforts on a rich soil for
countless generations without being able to
lift themselves out of the breadline, while
the individualistic Chinese and Arabs have
become wealthy in the face of every sort of
restriction put upon them by the Dutch, sug-
gests a practical nigger somewhere in the
theoretic woodpile. The spectacle of a group
of women and children laboriously planting
out the rice-plants one by one in the
immemorial manner of their ancestors gives
the answer. What the Communists really
.share is the awful, overwhelming collective
conservatism of the mob. It is a crushing
burden from which no member of the Com-
munist society can escape unless be becomes
a renegade. In Java, by the way, especially
in the mountain districts, the Communist
usually shares his diseases too. I think we
will have to look elsewhere for a short cut
to Utopia.
The Y.R.C. makes a commotion :—-
Those people who regard horseracing as an un-
healthy business for which a setback is desirable
have reason to be pleased with the circumstances
under which the Cup Carnival was held this year.
A great number of Australians who have no objection
to horseracing find that they have business in Mel-
bourne at Cup time ; and these Australians have dis-
tovered that a privileged class has been thrust upon
it by the V.R.C., the privileged class being the
members of the club and their friends. At Flcm-
ington this year the standards of privilege were
everywhere seen, in notices which proclaimed that
certain buildings and spaces previously open to
the public were for members only. A new stand,
built out of money which public patronage has
provided, faces a portion of the lawn wired off
from the rest so that the mere public may not intrude.
Actually, as was shown by their desertion of the
area, most of the people entitled to remain within
the reserve did not want to be snobs ; the V.R.C.
committee did them a disservice in indicating that
it thought they did, and incidentally spoiling the
long sweep of lawn once regarded as public property
and one of the beauties of Flemington.

Dear Bulletin, —The usual professor has
been at it again, and lias been reported in
Melbourne Age
At the Town Hall yesterday, Professor Ewart
delivered a lecture concerning his recent trip in
Central Australia. He stated that those who referred
to the “dead heart’’ of the continent failed to take
into account the large area, the rainfall, which
varied from 4in. to 30in., and the quality of the soil
which, while salty and sterile in parts, represented
land as rich in quality as any to be found in
Australia. Much of the territory he had passed
through carried permanent vegetation in the shape
of Mitchell, kangaroo and mulga grass. The land
would undoubtedly grow grain.
There are drawbacks, of course, as there are
everywhere except in Heaven, but the advan-
tages are so well known that the professors
who discourse on the grass in Central Aus-
tralia really ought to be superfluous. The
trouble isn’t lack of herbage; it is want of
political pull, lack of the pioneering instinct,
too much big city habit and big city selfish-
ness ; and it is to these things the professors
might now more profitably devote their atten-
tion. Thus the Age’s latest attitude is that a
Federal railway across S. Australia will be
another “State railway job,” the proposition
apparently being that the Commonwealth
can’t build into and across its own Northern
Territory without crossing some State, and
that State can’t be Victoria because it
doesn’t abut, and to get access through any
other State and spend some money there in
the process is a “job.”—Yours, etc., Grif-
fith Moses.
The Advisory Board set up by the Lyons
Government to search for additional sources
of national wealth, and advise as to the best
means of exploiting them,, lias been poking
an interested nose of inquiry into the possi-
bility of fisli-canning. For miles and miles
along the sunny east coast of the island, at
certain seasons of the year, the edge of the
Tasman Sea is fairly aswarm with sprats —
pilchards, sild and the real anchovy. Pro-
fessor Flynn, of Tas. Uni., has been telling
his countrymen all about this floating mass
of potential provender for a decade or so,
but profit-hunters do not seem to have been
convinced that it was worth while capturing
such small fry. Besides, tome score of years
ago a fish-canning factory was started on a
small scale at St. Helens, and failed to set
the foreshore afire. It. certainly canned fish
satisfactorily, but the little co. hadn’t enough
capital or pertinacity or something, and got
tired of trying to compete against cheap sar-
dines from Scandinavia. And there was little
local market, anyway, in a country where
nearly everybody goes fishing whenever he
wants a fish breakfast and generally catches
a few extra to give his next-door neighbor.
But as the population of the cities, both in
the Speck and on the mainland, has increased
during the past quarter-century, making it
increasingly difficult for the average house-
father to obtain Friday’s meat by his own
unaided rod or scallop-net, and as a healthier
appetite for home-grown products now pre-
vails in Australia, the Speck’s State Advisory
Board considers the small fish now worth
advertising.

“Troopiiorse” : The Home and Territories
Department really ought to round up the
scores of natives along the N.T. coast who
are suffering from leprosy. A few unfortu-
nate niggers and Chinese have been caught
in and around Darwin with the disease, only
to be dumped on the leper island a couple of
miles across the harbor. Here the poor
devils have torture added to tlieir troubles,
as the station is surrounded by mangrove
swamps, a breeding-place for sandflies and
mosquitoes. The station is visited once
every month by the Health Officer, who lands
flour and water. The house, or home, is a
few sheets of iron thrown together in any
sort of way; and whether the cases are blue,
black, white or otherwise they all come under
the one roof. A while ago a young lubra was
sent across as a leper. She had to live with
several other lepers, all males. By-and-bye
a child was born. What’s going to become
of the child? Is it to be classed as a leper?
About the same time a half-caste escaped
from the island by means of a canoe, roughly
made from several sheets of iron taken from
the house. He is still at large, and the last
I heard of him he was with several other
lepers near Port Essington. All along the

The worst case I have seen was at Blue Mud

fellow was a mass of sores from head to foot,
with several fingers of his right hand miss-
ing, and the left hand completely gone. Yet
he mixed with the rest of the tribe, who took
not the slightest notice of his disease. The
last inspection along the coast from Darwin
to Borroloola by a Government-paid doctor
was made by Dr. Strangman in 1907.

The finding by a Commonwealth liner of a
British steamer drifting a derelict, with its
entire crew helpless from malaria, and the
breaking out of 23 cases of the same
disease on the P. and O. Macedonia, suggest
that the microbe may have found another
host besides the anophele mosquito. That it
can adapt itself to its human landlord's
habits was disclosed in the malaria and
filaria survey of Queensland made last year
in connection with the hookworm campaign.
It was found in all but one of the cases
examined that the number of microfilariae in
the blood increased from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m., re-
mained fairly constant during the night, and
then decreased from (j a.m. till 9, when they
tended to disappear. In the one exception they
showed a tendency to increase during the day-
light hours, and investigation of the man’s
sleeping habits disclosed that for a week
previous to the taking of the test he had
been doing night-duty, lie was re-examined
on returning to day duty, and it was found
that the microfilariae- had returned to their
normal distribution. Malaria is endemic all
over the Northern State, and a mosquito that
bit by day and carried the malarial infection
would add to the difficulties of peopling Aus-
tralia’s tropics. Luckily energy and per-
sistence are all that are needed to remove
the menace altogether, and the little town
of Roma has given the right lead. It was
the only town in Queensland where the hook-
worm campaigners failed to find malaria
mosquitoes.

“Phoney” : This week the last of the 150-
odd pearling boats left Thursday Island for
the quarterly cruise. With two exceptions
the divers were all Japanese, and the crews
Jap or island boys. During their stay
.£25,000 was paid to the divers as their
share of the proceeds of the sale of the
shell; at least £24,000 of this will find its
way to Japan; and the proceeds of the
sale of the beche-de-mer and trochus-shell
will swell. the amount considerably. The
best conditions for pearling occur during
the last quarter of the year: this season
Japan may expect a Christmas present of
something like £40,000. Altogether well
over £lOO,OOO passes out of the country
annually in this way. The pearling com-
panies complain that the Japanese _are
obtaining a stranglehold on the industry.
But who is responsible for that? The
companies own the boats, and nobody but
they are to be blamed for the non-employ-
ment of whites. Certainly the owners
would lose money for a while if they did
not employ Japs; but it looks as if they’ll
lose eaerj/thing if they don’t change their
present plans.

“Spark Corp” : Repat., waking up late in
the day, as usual, has been having a round-
up of soldiers’ widows who have been draw-
ing pensions. Such pensions are supposed
to cease two, years after the pensioner re-
marries : bnt it has been found that numbers
of women have taken another dip in the
matrimonial lucky-bag without notifying the
Department, and gone on blithely drawing
the money. Harder hit than Repat., how-
ever, have been some of the widows who
have played the game towards it. ■ They
have discovered that the marital enthusiasm
of the- men they married petered out when
the pension lapsed, and many have lost their
weekly dole without finding a breadwinner.
Tlierfi are worse wasters still, who have mar-
ried war widows'in order to secure a grip
upon the pensions paid for deceased soldiers’
children: .and these pensions, as a result,
benefit the children hardly at all. The de-
plorable condition of some of these soldiers'
orphans calls loudly for departmental action-
but Repat. won’t be bothered. In N. S.
YV ales private philanthropists were prepared
to find money to do something in, the. matter;
but the scheme, petered out, officialdom being
too uninterested to give it countenance.

That jute impurities find their way into wool
is an old, complaint. But Australian woolgrowers
have been fleeced before now in this matter. This
wool 1 canvas pack now .advocated is .an - outcome of a
conference recently held in Bradford, of men interested
in the wool trade from the Yorkshire standpoint.
Granted that the presence of undetected jute fibres
in woollen fabrics is highly damaging and their
detection and removal, costly. Prevention would be
better than cure, no doubt, but who is going to pay
for it? The Australian woolgrower, clearly, if
Yorkshiremen have their say! A good many years
ago, when the agitation was first heard of, all sorts
of recommendations were .made and all sorts of
experiments undertaken by pastoralists, to their marked
loss. Jute sewing-twine was cited as an evil :
colored twine was recommended as being more visible,
and many woolgrowers, at great inconvenience and
expense, used the. blue twine. The rough Calcutta
pack'was condemned, and the more expensive and less
efficient hessian pack was largely introduced. Many
men turned their packs inside out and singed them;
many used a very expensive paper-lined pack. Were
any of these conscientious woolgrowers one whit the
better off for. it? Not an atom! No one has ever
been able ,to prove that any wool - realised a fraction
higher by virtue of having been carefully packed in
conformity with any of the multitudinous suggestions
that have from time to time floated around. If it
were so, the Australian would, not have gone back to
the old Calcutta woolpack, with its fluffy, nap of easily
detachable jute fibres all over both surfaces of it.
(By the way, the statement that Bradford buyers
allow a shilling a bale for paper-lined packs is incor-
rect.)
So long as the jute coverings are in use in any
form, it ; will be .difficult to terminate the nuisance
I have seen wool come into Sydney woolbrokers’
stores in all sorts of specially-prepared woolpacks,
including the paper-lined article. The wool has, to
be sold, and selling entails cutting the pack for
display purposes and cutting again for sampling .by
the woolbtiyers’ employees. This leaves frayed edges
of jute strands to get- mixed with the wool. Far
more, of the; objectionable fibre escapes into the
staple this way. than is “shed” off the sides'of the
pack. This phase, the handling, presents as many
difficulties as the initial packing part of the pro-
gramme. If wool went straight from grower to
manufacturer some of the difficulties might be over
come,'but as wool has to -be bought and sold by
inspection, whether -in England or in Australia,
interference with the -packs is necessary. I am not
one of those who advocate standing still even on a
high peak. But there are many avenues for improve-
ment in our wool more important—and promising
more benefit to the industry—than the question of
packing it so as to eliminate jute impurities.

“ Jae” : The present defence training is
only a travesty. The drills are so few and
far apart that the lads hardly begin to know
each other, let alone learn the art of soldier-
ing or sailoring. In the times when full
drills were being held, the improvement in
the different companies could be noted year
by year. What with restricted drills,
noisy agitators inciting the lads to resent dis-
cipline, legislators talking about abolishing
the system,' and the Government grudging
sufficient equipment, the morale of both the
trainees and their instructors has been
sapped. If it were possible for every lad on
attaining the age of, say, 16 to attend a
three-months’ continuous course for a thor-
ough grounding, the desired effect would be
obtained and the succeeding years of short
training be of some service. Surely such a
short period out of the life of each indivi-
dual is not too much to ask when the country
has so much at stake. Also, if it were pos-
sible to have pattern troops (regulars) as an
object-lesson to the trainee, it would have a
wondei-ful effect. I saw this in the early
stages of the war, when Australian Garri-
son Artillery (trainees) were stationed with
R.A.G.A. (permanent) at the examination
batteries round the coast. After a few weeks
the A.G.A. lads were spick-and-span soldiers
and took a pride in trying to emulate and
outdo the professional soldier. On the naval
side the periodical visits of the fleet have a
good effect, on the lads, but a three-months’
term aboard ' ship would be quite an adven-
ture to the average youngster, and in many
cases help to obtain recruits for the regular
service. '

POLITICAL
POINTS
Baldwin has given portfolios to Birken-
head and Austen Chamberlain, who were
members of the Lloyd George Coalition
Cabinet (objecting to its destruction, they
were left out of the Bonar Law Govern-
ment), and to Churchill also. Chamberlain
and Birkenhead will strengthen the Minis-
try, but the erratic Churchill —-a Conserva-
tive from 1909 till 1906, a Liberal for the
next nine years, then a Coalitionist (1917-22),
a Lloyd-G corgi an (1922), an Asquithian
(1923), a “Constitutionalist” opposing the
official Conservative (January, 1924), and
the same with Conservative endorsement
(October) —is a very doubtful acquisition as
Chancellor of the Exchequer, the job in which
his father “forgot Goschen.” However,
things might have been worse—Baldwin
could have sent him to the “Colonial” Office.
That post is to be filled by the steadfast
Amery, who has fairly earned promotion.
And another good friend of Australia in
Philip Lloyd-Greame goes to the Board of
Trade.
Stanley Baldwin recklessly pledged himself
not to raise the Protectionist issue in Eng-
land, having jumped to the. opinion that it
was a lost cause. Now he is looking round
for a substitute, which is as hard to find as
something that isn’t food but will do as
well. One idea is to restrict foreign loans
to countries which will take the money out
in British goods, or will throw in a tariff
preference along with the interest, and this
may mean that the Cold Country will only
lend to bad marks who will promise anything.
It is also proposed to inform defaulting
debtors that Britain will take out the inter-
est in tariff preference; but as they are
struggling to rebuild their own war-worn
industries they may prefer to go on default-
ing.
In one sense United States politics change
very little. The block of States which voted
against Coolidge, the Republican candidate
in 1924, was almost exactly the same block
which voted against Lincoln, the Republican
candidate in 1860. The south-east is largely
nigger; it is agricultural, chiefly in the direc-
tion of cotton, which is more of a hand in-
dustry and less of a machine industry than
most; it is poor and ill-educated, and it
believes in Freetrade, and wants to export
“primary products” and import manufactured
goods. The south-east is so much out of
the picture that no President lias been elected
from there since Zachary Taylor, in 1849.
Rather than permit a minority Labor
Government to raise the taxes, the 18 Liberals
and five Independent Libs, in the Vic. Assem-
bly agreed to let John Allan, leader of the
Cockv dozen, take command in a drive to
capture the Treasury Bench. Premier Pren-
dergast was chivalrous enough to give Allan
an opportunity to lodge notice of lus motion
as soon as he had it written out —he had the
Budget debate, in committee, cut short so
that Speaker Bowser could resume the chair
and “see” Allan. It is nearly 35 years since
Rodney last provided a Premier, and he
(Duncan Gillies) was one of the greatest
Victoria has known.
When the N.S.W. Nationalists named
Josiah Thomas as their candidate for the
vacancy in the Senate, a lot of Ministerial
supporters in the Leg. Council announced
their intention of voting against him on the
ground that the seat —that of the late Allan
McDougall—belonged to the Labor party.
Whereat there was loud laughter among the
Labor heads at Macdonell House. It is
extremely chivalrous of the Leg. Councillors,
and their attitude, in a sense, is correct.
But when the National Senator Adamson
died in Queensland in 1921, the Labor people
gave the job to one of their own men. The
notion of appointing a Nationalist never
entered their heads. Yet Adamson had
topped the poll; in fact, he got 5578 more
No. 1 votes than the three Labor candidates
together.
Federated unionism is a fine thing for
headquarters officials ambitious of getting
into Parliament or posing as little Lenins,
but it has brought no joy to members of
remote branches and the communities in
which thev live. Last year the best part or
£20,000 was dragged from the pockets of
Queensland coal-miners for the support of
an insensate N. S. Wales strike about which
they were never consulted. And those who
suffered most through the N. S. Wales up-
heaval in 1917 were the Fremantle wharf-
laborers, who were going about their work
contentedly, having no grievance against
their employers, when they were suddenly
called out by the head office of their union,
SYDNEY’S WATER SERVICE.
“The N. S. Wales Water Board perpetuates the old evil of divided control, the Public Works
Department having command of its finance.”
N.S.W. GOVERNMENT : “ There you are, my grousing friend — there’s a nice new tap.”
MR. SUBRUBS : “That’s all right. But what about taking your feet off the hose?”
2000 miles away. Many of the poor devils
had to remain out for two years. Now the
same Fremantle lumpers have been involved
in the silly “overtime” strike on the Sydney
wharves, along with the wliarfies in every
Australian port where there is a branch of
the Waterside Workers’ Federation. That
strike has already failed of its purpose, inas-
much as the soldier-watersiders who were
to have been frozen out are being implored
to join the Federation, but the sort of union-
ism which penalises the whole people every
time a trumpery local dispute breaks out is
no good to Australia or any other country.
Lang’s prospects of leading a N.S.W.
Labor Government have become poor since
Theodore, the Queensland Premier, was
authorised to re-admit Bailey, M.L.x\., and
the others expelled on account of the ballot-
boxes with sliding panels. Bailey was under
the ban when Mutch, of Botany, was run
against Lang for the State Labor leadership,
otherwise the solemn house-agent would have
been beaten. As it was, he was only one
ballot-paper to the good when the result was
declared, after being one down in the first
count. When the matter is raised again
Bailey’s vote will go against the man who
sided with the expulsionists, and his restored
influence as A.W.U. boss will affect other
votes. Another politician who is feeling none
too comfortable is Blakeley, the waspish
M.H.R. for Darling. Though general presi-
dent of the A.W.U. for a term, he also joined
the “reform” faction which has now thrown
in the towel.
At the Melbourne Labor Conference, Knee-
bone, M.L.A., a delegate from South Aus.,
announced that he would “scrap all muni-
tions of war.” The White Australia policy
being subsequently mentioned, the gentleman
—for years a Labor editor—declared that
it could be defended in Australia. With lead-
ing articles, no doubt, all other weapons
having been scrapped.
It was Johnny Lang, N.S.W. ex-Treasurer,
who began the thankless job of explaining in
the Sydney press that if representation had
gone according to the number of votes polled,
British Labor would have more seats than
it has. On the figures it possibly got fewer
than it deserved, but last time it got more
than it deserved, and it is difficult to see
what to do about it. In 1922, for instance,
for Salford, Derbyshire and Cathcart, Labor
scored in all 29,864 votes. Anti-Labor got
51,995 (Conservatives 28,887, and Liberals
23,108). And Labor captured all three seats.
Little Ben Tillett secured his election osten-
sibly by a majority of 19. though the real
majority against him was 4631.
One Hargreaves, from Tasmania, a dele-
gate at the Labor Conference in Melbourne,
made the pleasing suggestion that “the time
might come for the workers to take up arms
in order to maintain socialisation.” None of
the numerous pacifists at the conference —
pacifists as regards Huns, Turks, Refl-
Russians and so forth-protested that the
idea of making war on his fellow-Australians
was abhorrent to him. Then the delegates de-
cided that the A.L.P. should “convene a Pan-
Pacific Congress in Japan to promote a
closer understanding of the Labor move-
ments concerned.” Such a congress could
do no earthly good and might do a great deal
of harm. A large section of the Japanese
would certainly denounce it as a clumsy
Australian attempt to stir up sedition m
Nippon.
For close on two years the big Queens-
land irrigation works on the Dawson River,
behind Bundaberg and Maryborough, man-
aged to carry on without a strike. It was
felt that this was a record worthy of celebra-
tion, so a mixed party of Parliamentarians
visited the Utopia. That queered the pitch,
for the navvies straightway discovered that
they ought to be paid for time spent in walk-
ing to the job, as well as working on it,
since the job refused to walk to them. The
strike was still on when this report closed.
“Australia First”: The N.S.W. State
Brickworks recently gave an order for Id
electric motors of American manufacture at
a higher price than a Fivedock (N.S.W.)
firm offered a supply them at. Yet there
could be no better evidence of the quality of
the Australian product than the fact that
something like 3000 are already in use. This
State-owned business showed a profit on last
year’s working, and it isn’t pleasant to think
that some of those profits are going to
America when they might have been used to
Australian advantage.
Some of the weightiest testimony given be-
fore the Vic. Police inquiry was that of N.S.W.
Inspector-General Mitchell, No. 1 man
of a force which compares for efficiency with
any in the world; and in many ways it
favored the men. The introduction of plain-
clothes men to watch uniformed police was,
he said, foreign to his ideas of discipline.
But when he was asked whether he con-
sidered that it would be possible to reinstate
men who had broken their oaths, lie declared
in so many words that that wasn’t a ques-
tion for him to answer. He thought that
plain-clothes supervision would put a very
bm strain on the loyalty of the men, and
left it at that.
Ivan Bolsheviksky, of Trotskow, isn’t in
the least subdued by the knowledge that his
own lack of tact helped materially to pull
down the Scotch friend who wanted to lend
him £50,000,000 —the only friend on earth
who had the idea of lending him anything.
Instead he has gone into the mad-dog line
of business, and denounces everybody, includ-
ing Ilamsay, from whom he has no further
hopes, and whom he accuses of forging the
clumsy Zinovieff letter. In fact, he threatens
to establish an international tribunal, and
try Ilamsay for treason to the Bolshevik
cause, in his presence if he can be caught
and in his absence if he can’t. The sentence
will presumably be death, unless the humor-
less Ivan realises that he is making an
ass of himself.
The difficulty of awakening any live inter-
est in Canberra has been again demon-
strated. Tenders for the leasing of the Gov-
ernment “hostel” were invited in all the
States, but not a drink-selling soul in the
whole of Australia made a sporting bid.
Confidence in the Half-Time Town is a shrub
of slow growth.
Maoriland, like Victoria, is becoming un-
easy about the indestructibility of bar-
maids. Nearly a decade ago an Act of Par-
liament laid it down that no more girls or
women should adopt the calling. All exist-
ing Hebes were licensed, the assumption be-
ing that they would dwindle and become
extinct in a dozen years or so. But it was
lately elicited in Parliament that there has
been little, if any, diminution in their num-
ber. Hardly a single (or other) barmaid has
died, got married or been removed from the
beer pump in any other way since the Act
was passed. The Government has decided
to inquire into the matter of the licenses, and
find out whether there is trafficking in them.
When the Ormonde was nearing Fremantle
on her last trip to Australia an infant was
born to German parents, the father being a
briquette expert coming to the Morwell
(Vic.) brown-coal scheme. It looks as if
his arrival might give the Law a nut to
crack. The kid is a British subject, of
course, but the question whether mutter is
entitled to the £5 bonus is not settled so
easily. The Act says that £5 is to be paid
for children born in Australia, or on board a
ship proceeding from one Australian port to
another, and the experts are trying to figure
out how the Ormonde rates. If the new-
comer had put in an appearance when the
ship got into territorial waters there would
be no doubt about it—our fool law would
make the parents a gift of £5.
The knightly Mcßeatli. who has just
returned from the latest League of Nations
meeting at Geneva, has been telling of the
part the cook plays in adjusting national and
international difficulties. But Australia
already knew something about the subject.
If it has forgotten it can still examine the
accounts of the Federal Convention for lun-
cheons and dinners.
Women of all parties have joined to ask
the South Aus. Government to do somethingfor
the “younger and whiter” children in the
country where the State joins on to the N.T.
The idea is that the new Federal scheme in
connection witli half-castes shall be supple-
mented by the State, quadroon and octoroon
children to be taken from their mothers at
the age of about two and placed in “decent
civilised homes; no doubt the mothers will
object, but sentiment should be placed on
one side.” The Government has answered
sympathetically that it will get a report on
the whole question from some experienced
person, but “the request seems to be one
entirely for the Commonwealth to consider
and decide.”
ARMISTICE DAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
’Tis sunset, and across the land
That, lit with crimson, glows,
His scythe upon his uncouth back,
The shambling Slayer goes.
2Jo more the monstrous hound of war
With hate and horror hunts,
And silence, soft and soothing, lies
Along the sacred Fronts.
Go. Slayer, go and come no more
To shatter, maim and kill,
And bend and twist the souls of men
Beneath thy awful will!
Beneath thee lies the stricken earth,
Red gaping, gashed and lined.
Go, Slayer, go—thy work is done;
Yet leave thy scythe behind.
For fashioned ’tis of goodly steel,
And in the smithy’s light
By sledge and forge it shall be made
A ploughshare, brave and bright.
The fierce, hot battle-blast is spent
That scourged the world a span;
A thousand sweet, earth-voices cry:
“Take up thy work, O man!
“Take up thy work, and till the soil,
The axe and mattock swing;
For, torn and tortured, thou hast had
A bitter lessoning!
“Put right the clock of time again,
Its rightful hour restore;
Thrust out the savage from thy blood,
And chain him evermore!”
A shambling shape, the Slayer goes,
About him muted drums;
AVhile, light of foot, upon his tracks
The Sower, singing, comes.

“Vanikoro” : When lie found that his “boy
had dropped 205., a big slice of his year’s wages,
in the plate at a meeting where a native
teacher took up the collection, Dr. Cilento,
the Director of Health for the New Guinea
Territory, asked the boy why he had been
so excessively liberal. The “boy” replied
that the teacher had told them that .Jesus
Christ was stranded in Sydney, that he had
no clothes, no kai-kai, no money and no
Mary, and that unless they threw m liber-
ally he would die of cold and hunger. Then
there will be no one to sing out for us alonga
God, and we die finish quick time and go to
Hell,” the “boy” added. The desire to escape
this fate made the congregation put in nearly
all they possessed. Dr. Cilento told the
white missionary about this and he was
much distressed. He admitted that he had
told the teacher to tell the boys in the pidgin
that the collection was for Jesus. With
that for a start the rest was easy. The
teacher reasoned that if Jesus wanted money
he must want it for something, and he
stirred up his audience by telling them about
the only things that the Kanaka thinks lie
needs. 'As to the Redeemer’s place of resi-
dence, there is a reason for Sydney, unex-
pected as it is. Obviously He was not in
the islands, and Sydney is the only other
place the average Kanaka ever heard about.
* * # *
“The Deacon” : Australia will see its first
organised religious pilgrimage leave these
shores next April. Lourdes is to be the
Mecca, and R.C.’s the devotees. Archbishop
Mannix has been selected by the R.C. hier-
archy to be their representative, and the com-
mittee has unanimously offered him the
leadership. The P. and O. Co. has been
approached and the necessary accommoda-
tion secured. The trip, which will include
London and all the Continent, will cost the
pilgrims £270.
“J.H.M.A.”: There
is no great harbor on
the east coast of Aus-
tralia whose scenery
has so little changed
since its discovery by
white men as Port
Stephens. A century
ago the Australian
Agricultural Co. came
and squatted in the
Hunter River district,
with its superinten-
dents and overseers in
control of a small
army of penal and
free labor, put up
houses, mills, barracks
and factories, an d
thought it was going
to revolutionise a con-
tinent with its up-to-
date methods of divi-
dend-delivery. For a
hundred years the
sawyer and the split-
ter have been cutting
down and hacking up
cedar, ti-tree and
eucalyptus; and still
dense forests cover the
blue ranges that make
the background of the
beautiful, landlocked
inlet. Almost any-
where along the fore-
shores it would be pos-
sible for a film-pro-
ducer to set up his
camera and make a
picture of the first
arrival of civilisation
in the place, so little
visible evidence is
there of it ever having
arrived at all. This
would not be easy to
do in Port Jackson,
Port Macquarie,
Botany, Jervis, Broken
or Twofold bays. But
it is at Port Stephens,
where the plaintive
note of the oyster and
the cooing of the cray-
fish are as little inter-
rupted by the noises of industry as they were
in 1824.

“Gouger” : Though I had just blown in from
our farthest north, this shingled hair didn’t
seem strange. All the little black girls of
Cape York Peninsula have their wool cut once
a year. The subject sits on a rock, while the
barber places a flat stone underneath the
tangled locks and bangs at them with an-
other stone. The operation causes the ends
to look a bit frayed, but that does not matter.
Sometimes the shearing instrument is a
jagged piece of quartz or glass. For some
inscrutable reason the females always prefer
the barber to be a man. The discarded

hair is woven into wigs; and, ornamented
with scarlet berries and colored feathers,
they are reckoned to have a very fetching
effect at corroborees and dances.
* * * *
“Ellae” : In support of the theory that the
first-born is often the least robust of a family
“Ex-Englishman” (B. 30/10/’24) recalls
that a first-born has seldom occupied the
British throne. Nevertheless, such rulers
as were first-born have almost always
been the most efficient. William the
Norman won England from second-born
Saxon Harold; first-born Edward I.
nearly conquered Scotland, to have it
lost again by fourth-born Edward II.;
Edward 111. was a first-born, so w 7 as
his even more famous sou the Black Prince.
The latter’s second son had his crown taken
by first-born Henry IV. After three gen-
erations the first-born Duke of York gained
it: his fourth son, Richard 111., lost it to
first-born Henry VII. Elizabeth, like the
brother and sister who reigned before her,
was the first-born of her mother (Henry
VIII.’s wives seldom lasted long enough to
have any more). Also, the four British
sovereigns whose reigns topped the half-
century (Henry 111., Edward 111., George
111. and Victoria) were all first-born.
* * * *
“Hamer”: An unusual species of heroism
was that recently shown by a 22-year-old
Roumanian doctor who, himself on the point
of a collapse, insisted on carrying out an
operation, dying immediately afterwards with
“Take care of my patient” on his lips. The
patient lived. Somehow it recalls the case
of a Sydney medico who left all he had, not
a great deal, to be used in cancer research.
He was a sufferer from the disease himself,
and what he had to endure was so terrible,
and all remedies so futile, that he seems to
have decided suicide was the only way out.
But, according to evidence elicited at the
inquest, there is every reason to believe he
was interrupted almost in the act. The in-
terruption came from a man with an urgent
need for medical attendance. The doctor
fixed him up, declined a fee, showed him out.
and then proceeded with the grim business of
taking his own life.
* * ’ * #
“J.E.”: According to a cable message a
Mexican woman died at Los Angeles
(U.S.A.), and all the 16 or 18 Mexicans who
attended the funeral took the complaint and
died also. Thereupon the local doctors un-
failingly diagnosed the trouble as Black
Death, though it is hard to say how they
were so sure, for, according to belief, the
real Black Death appeared only once in his-
tory, and the last living witness died
half-a-thousaud yeai-s ago. The old tale goes
that the trouble began in China, being
heralded by earthquakes, droughts, famines,
floods and swarms of locusts. It travelled
westward accompanied by impenetrable fogs,
and the seasons turned upside down, the hot
weather coming: in winter and the snow in
summer. Whether it only rained in dry
weather the chronicle sayeth not. These
phenomena recall a legend of the Last Day
of Babylon, when the writing appeared on
the palace wall, and a two-headed infant
was born to poor but honest parents who
lived in a Babylonian shack near the temple
of Baal, and a" huge red moon, with the face
of Nebuchadnezzar painted on it, set in the
east two hours before its time. I haven t
read anything of a painted mdon heralding
the Los Angeles affair; but there was an
American Presidential election, and the Fates
who govern these matters may have reckoned
that that was weird enough for anything.
* * * *
“Chliota Peg” : When the subject of hasty
marriages is exhausted, what about a few
dilatory bridegrooms? I was bidden to a
small and select wedding in a Gippsland
township the other day, and struck the limit
in my experience. The bride and the break-
fasters were at the church bright and early,
but the "groom failed to put in an appear-,
ance. After half an hour’s wait the lady's
father became restless, and set out to inves-
tigate the cause of the delay. He found his

prospective son-in-law calmly ploughing; the
young man explained he wanted’to finish the
paddock before knocking off. A short argu-
ment caused him to modify his views, and a
quick change and a wash converted him into
a fitting subject for love, honor, obedience
and confetti.

THE IMPENETRABLE MYSTERY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The British Labor Cabinet, before resigning, held
an investigation into the Zinovieff letter, but was
Unable to decide whether it was authentic or not. In
Russia every newspaper has a different version ; Zino-
vieff’s own official organ declares that Mr. Ramsay
Macdonald wrote the letter himself.”
Why worry? Just wait till Judgment Day when the
Lord will make all things clear,
And solve the puzzles that men go grey in trying to
solve down here.
There are mysteries baffling the wisest brains that
have ever tackled them yet;
We get no answer to Please Explains, and none are
we like to get.
You may ask professors, but what’s the good?—you
might as well ask in bars—-
For information where Eden stood, or whether there’s
life on Mars.
And those giant blocks, maybe sons old, on Stone-
henge bleak and bare,
You may ask, but you’ll never on earth be told, how
the builders brought them there.
But the Day will come when He’ll rip the veils un-
pierced by mortal view,
And we’ll know the “strong” of a thousand tales and
which, if any, were true:
How the pioneering Vikings died who first to the
New World pressed,
And what was it hustled over the side the crew of
the Marie Celeste.
Their pros and their cons the Red Page scribes no
more will need to hurl
Re “What Became of the Lost Ten Tribes?” and
“Was Sappho a Modest Girl ?”
We’ll be kept no more in ignorance while experts
disagree
Whether Cleopatra had ever a ohance to vamp grim
Julius C.
THE FINANCIER.
“Father says he will give me fifty pounds if I never speak to
you again.”
"Grab it, quick—we could get married on that right away."
1 sometimes long for the final blow of Gabriel’s
trumpet, when
I think of the things I’ll never know —nor anyone
else—till then.
The light of a million arcs will blaze on many a
secret hid;
We shall know if Shakspeare wrote the plays he
claimed, or if Bacon did.
We’ll jerry to “Junius,” his pen-name through: one’ll
only have to ask
To be wised who Orton was, and who The Man in
the Iron Mask.” .
Now one riddle more to the stack’s consigned
That keeps us groping' in darkness blind
With the high gods dumb and deaf;
Till all mankind ’fore the Throne is lined
There’s never a Sherlock Holmes shall find
Who penned that fateful letter signed
With the name of Zinovieff!

An echo from the Vic. courts:—
The Younger case threatens to make something of
the history which was elsewhere produced by the
Farr and Polini cases. The appeal of the husband
having been maintained by Judge Williams, the
Women’s National League has taken up the affair as
involving an injustice to women, and the Attorney-
General is being urged to reopen the matter on a
charge which hints at the manipulation of evidence.
Younger is a wealthy contractor in the forties; he
married a girl, who left him after a few days and
subsequently took proceedings for maintenance. On
the face of it, it looked like an attempt to obtain
money from a wealthy man while refusing him
marital rights; but the Bench listened to some
appalling evidence which caused it to decide that
the wife was wholly justified in withdrawing from
her husband, and awarded substantial maintenance.
At the hearing of the husband’s appeal, however,
Judge Williams dealt with the case on the plain
issue of the wife’s persistent refusal to return to
her husband, and discharged the order; and those
who are battling for the right of a woman to
withdraw herself from her husband in certain cir-
cumstances, assert that such a judgment overlooks the
main element in the case. Incidentally, the case
illustrates the inadequate fashion in which records of
proceedings in the lower courts are taken; and that
plain fact ought to make it more difficult for the
IT SAVES SO MUCH TROUBLE.

MILDEED : “So do I —if they are made out in my name.”

“Sixenate”: Tearful pleading for “a
chance” by a young woman charged with
theft from the person caused a Melbourne
jury to add a strong recommendation to its
verdict of guilty; and it looked as if it could
eat its own soft head when the police pro-
duced a list of 25 convictions. The delin-
quent, who is still in the twenties, left the
court sobbing and protesting her intention
to reform; but Sydney Courts have often
seen and heard her in the same role. Even
in Sydney the damsel’s ability to look inno-
cently pathetic has frequently won her light
treatment, and once gained her a husband.
He was one of the victims of her light fingers,
but, impressed by her tears of penitence,
offered to marry her if the Court would dis-
charge her. For his own good the police
objected, but a sentimental magistrate let her
go. Twice afterwards the quixotic young
man appeared and undertook to look after
lier if she were dealt with leniently, but
after that he gave up the job of reformation
as beyond him, and disappeared—probably
to the other end of the earth.
FORBIDDEN FRUIT.
THE FAIR ONE : “And what hind of a husband would you advise me to look for?”
HER FRIEND : “You leave husbands alone, my dear; it’s asking for trouble—you, go
for a single man.”
“Noo Zee”: Speaking of war souvenirs,
here’s how I got a Mauser rifle home to
M.L. After an abortive attempt to take
one across to England—the Embarkation
people came down hard on such souvs. —
I took another to an Aussie sister at No. 3
A.G.H., Abbeville, and suggested that she
try to smuggle it across in her valise. She
evolved a better plan. In her ward was a
big Enzed with a broken thigh, whom she
was preparing for the trip to Blighty
per hospital train and ship. The rifle was
firmly strapped alongside the injured limb,
acting as a splint. Once on the ‘stretcher
the Enzed was never shifted off it till his
arrival at an English hospital, and he
afterwards left the rifle at my address in-
London. The nurse and I—we were married
by this time —brought back the souvenir
to Maoriland; there was a little trouble over
it at Wellington, but our persuasive methods
were effective.

“Jesmond”: Talking of jobs requiring
coolness, the officers in charge of bombing
squads in the train-
ing camps had
every opportunity
of showing that
quality. It was no-
thing unusual to
see them walk up
to a dud. unscrew
the base-plug, and
pull out the fuse
and detonator.
Most relied on their
hearing if the fuse
was burning, and
the number of acci-
dents was very
small. At Fovant,
Wilts, I saw a
young two-pip
Pommy walk out
after duds seven
times in one day;
four of them hap-
pened not to be
duds, but he always
managed to throw
himself down, and
the splinters flew
harmlessly over-
, . head. In one case
he was unscrewing the plug when he heard
the striker act, yet lie carried on so coolly
that lus cigarette didn’t need relighting.

“Henry Horsecollar” digs in kings’ tombs:
Concerning “Feng-Shui’s” repetition (B. 6/11/’24)
of the story that the present Japanese ruler is the
122nd of his line and the direct descendant of
Jimmu, who founded the dynasty 2584 years ago, let
us spread our own national tail-feathers in the’ re-
membiance that the kings of England and Scotland
once had pedigrees as long as Jimmu’s; but the joke
began to look foolish, and is now quite out of date.
So, in the opinion of many, is that about the House
of David. Apart from doubts regarding persons like
Eber, Peleg and lieu, the ruling family apparently
ended with Ahaziah some 2800 years ago, which was
even before Jimmu, though it nominally resumed
after a break of six years. Any royal line which
lasted one-seventh as long as Jimmu’s is said to have
done, except by taking in sons-in-law or adopting
remote relatives, is dashed remarkable. Among the
Caesars the habit of leaving no direct male descendant
was almost hereditary from the first. Britain has a
royal family which goes back the very creditable
distance of 1100 or 1200 years. If a capable liar
got to work on Egbert’s pedigree it would go back
twice as far. But there are difficulties about the
continuity. One gap was bridged because a king’s
widow, daughter of a French lunatic and mother of
an English one, married a knight of Wales, and her
Welsh son strengthened his position by marrying a
lady who descended from the illegitimate son of the
third or fourth son of another king who had died a
long time previously. There were other gaps almost
as bad ; still they were bridged also, and the heir of
Alfred sits on the throne to-day. The way direct
lines die out, even when no violence is applied, is
exasperating. The Tudors wound up with three
childless sovereigns, and the Valois did the same,
and the Stewarts finished in much the same fashion.
I really have very little faith in the 122nd direct
heir of Jimmu, even if such a person did reign 2554
years ago. And I have very little faith in that also.

“P. Pawnticket”: The. recent Henley
Regatta at Melbourne served to draw notice
to ..n unadvertlrod occupation. A man who
was “scrutin’ ” about the river-banks the
day following the tig event tried to clamber
into one of the buildings which had been
used as a refreshment booth. He was
charged with bting on the premises for an
unlawful purpose, but as there was nothing
to steal in the place, and as he pleaded that
he was merely looking for loose change and
sundries left behind by the crowd, the case
was dismissed. The prospector mentioned
that he got up at 4 a.m. and founl sixpence,
so the game in Melbourne doesn’t seem gilt-
edged. An early-morning searcher on Bondi
Beach (Sydney) once told me that ss. a
morning was about his average, his finds
varying from money to a set of false teeth
and a wig. Rewards for lost articles were
the chief source of revenue; there was also
a small income to be picked up by restoring
lost dogs to their owners. The Melbourne
“scruter” refused to admit that his returns
were nearly so remunerative, instancing as
his best find a gold brooch for which he got
ss. reward: But his pessimism may have
been assumed for the purpose of keeping
other operators off his pitch.

“Verri” : Maoriland health authorities are
becoming seriously perturbed over the preva-
lence of goitre in the Dominion. The trouble
is widespread, and not confined to any par-
ticular locality, though some areas are more
affected than others. The thermal districts
seem particularly prone to the disease, and
it was the revelation that the proportion of
goitrous children ran in some cases as high
as 75 per cent, that stirred the Health
Department to action. The origin of the
trouble is still obscure, but as a general
medical idea now seems to be that a defici-
ency of iodine is responsible, this drug in
tablet form is being supplied free to the
schools. In most cases children affected show
a decided improvement after a few months,
and in cases of incipient goitre the results
have been very satisfactory.
* * * *
“Lmfaan” : Tell me what a roysterer takes
home when he decides that there is no
other place to go to and I wall tell you his
nationality. The Pommy heads for his
own roof with fish and chips in one hand;
plastered over the face of an inquisitive Bobby
Peel, they often prove an easy ticket for a
night’s shelter. Failing penguin eggs (ready
cooked at the Greek’s), a true S’African
likes a couple of bunches or so of turnip
radishes, which he eats reflectively from the
stalk while trekking for the tall timber. No
Maorilander is happy without a bottle of
“Stewart Islands” when the beer has run out.
Fritz insists on his “Gurke” (Anglice,
gherkin). Garlic sausage provides the
shield and buckler for the over-wined French-
man or Italian when he faces Madame. The
Canadian —like the Yank in anti-Prohibition
days—clings fondly to “hot dogs,” i.e., sav-
eloys. The Aussie, as befits a hardy battler,
drags home the horny, handy cray. good to
eat, and, swung by an expert, a first-class
weapon for offence and defence, and much
enjoyed by constables on night duty at the
watch-house.
* * * *
“Barb” : How’s this for a peripatetic lock-
up? The clink at Mount Isa (Q.) was
originally erected on the Croydon goldrush.
From there it -was removed to the once-busy
copper centre of Ballara, outside Cloncurry.
Now it is serving the needs of a silver camp.
And there are still a few more fields to choose
between —coal, cane and the one Ikey McMo
lays the short odds against.
* * * *
“Bay Webb”: The birth aboard an Eng-
lish ship in Australian waters may give the
law a nut to crack, but graver problems
than any connected with the baby bonus
may arise at any moment out of the two
meanings of the word mile. Even a casus
belli may swing on the distance of a ship
from land. International law assigns three
miles as the stretch seaward over which a
Government may exercise control, but- what
sort of a mile is not specified. Yet three
nautical miles exceed three statute miles by
799 yards, and a lot of things might happen
in that belt of water. The child born aboard
a ship on the English registry whilst the
ship is over three miles from land is upon
the registry of Stepney, London; inside that
limit the new arrival becomes a native of the
country in whose waters the ship is. But as
long as the word “mile” may be interpreted
in two ways there will be room for doubt.

“Bundy” : There are plenty of ocean tra-
gedies more recent than the Marie Celeste
affair, and every bit as inexplicable. Here
is one. On March 2, 1910. the British barque
Inverness-shire sailed from Hamburg for Cali-
fornia under Captain Ivinnon with a crew of
30 men. She was spoken off the Cape Verde
Islands in May. On June 15 the ship, in
perfect condition, but with not a soul on
board or anything to indicate what had be-
come of captain and crew, was boarded by
the first officer of the Italian steamer Yernia
in south latitude 52, longitude 50 west. She
lay at anchor, with every sail furled, west
of the Falkland Islands. The long boats
and the gig swung from the davits. There
was a pot of beef-stew on the galley-stove,
a pack of cards on the mess-room table, an
accordion and a banjo in the fo’c’s’le, in the
captain’s cabin a copy of Coleridge’s “An-
cient Mariner” lying face downwards as if
the reader had been called away suddenly.
But nothing living was on board except a few
cats, too well fed to have been left long.
THE MEAL.
HUBBY: “Another bathing-costume? I bought
you one last season.”
WIFEY : “Oh, George, I’m so sorry, a moth
ate it.”
Everything pointed to a hurried departure,
but. there Avas nothing to suggest the why or
the how of it. The barque was almost with-
in sight of land, and it was midwinter.
Tugs towed her to Port Stanley, in the Falk-
lands, and the owners had to pay a heavy
salvage bill. Alleged survivors of the Marie
Celeste have been turning up at intervals
for 50 years, but as far as I know nobody
has ever claimed to be able to throw any
light on the fate of Captain Ivinnon and the
crew of the Inverness-shire.
OH, THE SPRINGTIME!
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
short a(^ °f Spring, skirts have grown
The winter is a dreary time
U hen good earth turns to mud;
I think the melancholy rain,
That weeps and sighs and weeps again,
Must leak into the blood
And clog the arteries with grime,
So close misgivings cling ;
Grey skies our timid pleasures mar
And none has heart to wander far
From home and fireside ; but (tra-la!)
’Tis different in the Spring.
For then immortal trumpets blow
Along the dazzling skies,
And airs intoxicating fan
Wild ardors in the heart of man
To deeds of high emprise;
No longer by a raincoat bound
He feels himself a king,
And must adventure, strive and fight
To manifest his new delight,
And fitly vindicate thg might
Of the resplendent Spring.
And woman feels this prompting, too;
An urge within her stirs
To brave some fiery monster’s rage,
Take up the sword, throw down the gage;
But in such fields as hers
Only one dragon looms in view
At which to have a fling;
So when insurgently she baits
Dame Grundy and abbreviates
(Again!) her skirts, she simply sates
The impulses of Spring.

The distribution of bonus scrip has become
almost a habit with this sturdy old Austra-
lian co. Not a year has been missed since
1918, and this last £25,000 makes a total of
£210,000 handed out in the seven years. And
there were distributions prior to TB. There
still are 25,000 £lO shares unallotted, so it
is possible to go on doing it if the directors
want to. Thus far disclosed profits for each
recent year have been more than enough
to provide the 10 p.c. and the bonus: last
year, despite a higher loss rate, £14,711 was
left. Gross premium income increased
£20,000-odd on the year, and confidence in
the quality of the business is indicated by
the smaller re-insurances :

Last year interest and rents alone were more
than sufficient to pay the div., leaving a little
over plus the whole of the profit from under-
writing to strengthen reserves and provide
the bonus sweets. The United is now in
its 63rd year, and the bonus issues of recent
years are the. reward of early prudence and
moderation. Even from 1900 onwards, when
big profits were being made, 121 p.c. ivas
the maximum div.; on the first capitalisation
of reserves in 1912 the rate was dropped
to 10 p.c., and there it has been kept. In
that year reserves were £189.810, and the
transfer of £20,000 took paid capital to
£l2O 000. The present capital is £375,000;
and of the £255,000 added since 1912 only
£25.000 has come from an issue for money
—5OOO shares were offered at par, and of
course taken. Yet, despite the £250,000 of
scrip given to shareholders; visible reserves
have grown steadily, and are now £204,224
greater than when the first £20,000 was
handed out.
Policy-holders need not lose any sleep.
Paid capital and reserves total £709,034; if
they were only half as much they would still
be not unreasonably inadequate: the co. could
this year be hit by losses as great as it has
had to meet in the past five years, and still
have over a quarter of a million in its long
stocking. And every transfer of reserves to
capital, instead of weakening the policy-
holder’s security, has strengthened it, inas-
much as every share issued has carried with
it a liability of £5.

But those reserves are not all accumulated
profit: included is £462,000 to cover unex-
pired risks. Probably 40 p.c. of the year s
premiums would be sufficient for the purpose,
and that would be £351,920; so there is a
large margin for safety there. One expects
that sort of thing, though, in this solid old
concern. The 1,031,640 shares of £1 are
paid to 155., and the Is. lid, handed out on
them for the year mopped up no more than
53 p.c. of the profits: the balance went to
make policy-holders feel still more comfort-
able. They have the satisfaction of know-
ing that with its cash and Government secu-
rities alone the co. could during this current
year meet losses three times greater than last
year’s, and still leave the current year’s net
premiums untouched. It is a remarkable
position to be in.
The South British has an almost world-
wide marine connection, and, as usual with
cos. doing a large marine business, the loss
rate is stiff and the expense rate moderate:

The expense rate has been climbing; but so
have other figures. The former, after all,
is only 30 p.c. more than it was in 1900, and
it is pretty certain that there has been a
greater movement than that in the insurable
value of the lines covered by the co. Further,
the exes, include rates and taxes, and they
have become much more corpulent since the
war began to eat money by the hundred mil-
lions. Actually, therefore, the business is
done more cheaply now than it was when
the century was an infant. But it is doubt-
ful whether with a shrinkage in values there
will be also a shrinkage in exes. Still, the
South British can stand a bit of a slide that
way. Its income from interest and rents
alone last year more than paid the dividend ;
and the management didn’t have to do any
wild-catting either to earn the £103,113 re-
ceived on that account. There is a line.
“Stocks, debentures and shares, £252,161,”
which might be anything; but apart from
that the list of assets is exceptionally solid:
Premises .. .. .. .. £347,368
Mortgages . . . . .. . . 62,663
Deposits and cash balances .. . . 348,921
Stocks, debentures and shares . . 252,161
Municipal and Harbor Board de-
bentures .. .. . . 106,192
Government securities .. .. 1,230,123
Sundries .. .. .. .. 57,779
In 1914 mortgages amounted to almost 32
p.c. of the assets; but they have been dis-
placed by securities which for the most part
can be marketed at a few hours’ notice, bring
in a good return, in many cases are tax-free
and don’t need so much looking after. The
authorised capital is in 2.000,000 shai*es. As
mentioned before only 1,031,640 have so far
been issued. The Wild Cat wouldn’t regard
a shareholder as an absurd optimist if he
allowed himself to think that he might get a
few more of them some day.

The year's splendid profit is within striking
distance of the figure of the peak year; and
whereas it was plain to the discerning that
trouble lay beyond 1920. there seems nothing
very dreadful immediately beyond 1924. Cer-
tainly the artificial prosperity which proceeds
from wild Government borrowing must
sooner or later give the ship ti'ouble; but for
the present, at any rate, opulent wool, wheat
and other cheques will ballast her. The pub-
lic’s interest in this co. is increasing. In 1920,
when the proprietary went on the market,
114,304 71 2nd prefs. were taken up. Now
both 6 and 71 p.c. prefs. and ordinaries are
a popular investment; for not only are pro-
fits stepping up, but reserves are travelling
the same path—a clear £28,750 was added
last year. But this surplus may be wanted
presently. The co. has just got to work on
a big building campaign-new premises are
to go up in Castlereagh and Elizabeth streets
—and for the next two or three years a lot
of money will be unproductive. How the
campaign is to be financed has not been an-
nounced. The co. naturally hasn’t the cash
in hand to do the job. Its position in that
respect is as follows :
1920. 1923. 1924.
Deposits .. .. £14,369 £12,519 £23,985

p.c. 2nd prefs 114,304 135,696
Unspecified . . 100,000
Total . . 758,833 241,167
Ordinaries are worth about 265. 6d., and
there are buyers of first nrefs. at 17s. 9d.
and of second prefs. at 20s. From that it
looks as though 74 p.c. will have to be paid
for the new capital; and that will be a bit
of a drain on. the profits for a while. Some
of it may be got a point or so cheaper on
mortgage; but pref. shareholders will not
want to see a new creditor for any large
amount thrust between them and their secu-
rity.
At present prefs.’ security is very solid.
Net assets on July 31 were £957,556; and
the two lots of pref. capital are together
£264,304. The ordinaries have the protec-
tion of nearly £200,000 of reserves; and there
is no goodwill in the accounts. In that
respect these trading cos. offer the investor
something that an industrial co., for example,
can’t. There is practically no capital sunk
in plant that would be next door to value-
less in the improbable event of a wind-up:
David Jones’s chiffons don’t depend for their
value on being in David Jones’s shop. As
for dividend prospects, as shown above there
is a comfortable margin between disclosed
earnings and dividends. But in a business
of this sort disclosed earnings are governed
very largely by stocktaking; for instance,
if the directors could have deferred the
issue of their 1920 accounts for 12 or
18 months they certainly would not have
shown a profit of £101.249: they would pro-
bably have struck £50.000 off it by valuing
the stock at that much less. And then there
is the question of the co.’s transfer to new
quarters. At present it isn’t much of a shop-
ping district, and, though the new under-
ground railway may make a great change, it
lias to be considered whether the co. may not
have to fight pretty hard for a few years to
bring trade that way.

Last year capital was increased by £lOO,OOO
—£50,000 of ordinaries and £50,000 of 6 p.c.
prefs. It went chiefly in cutting down the
amounts owing to the bank and sundry credi-
tors ; in ’23 that item was £320,211; at
August 2it was £210,553. This addition to
capital is only the second in the past decade,
the first being the calling up of the remaining
10s. on 175.000 bonus shares issued paid to
10s. in 1910. During the year the co.’s big
branch at Newtown, Sydney, was burnt down,
but the loss and consequent disorganisation
had no visible effect on sales, which, the
directors state, were of record dimensions.
The profits were greater than in any year
except 1920.
Balance-sheet movements since 1915 have
been as follows:
1915. 1920. 1923. 1924.
Mortgages. . . . £69,500 £70,000 £53,500 £51,500

The co. does a big t.p. business; hence the
large bundle of book debts. There is an
element of risk in these, but in good times,
such as the present, there is fine profit in
taking it. The disclosed profit in excess of
dividends is not, as a rule, large, though in
the past exceptionally fat year it reached
£18,285, or something over 7 p.c. on ordi-
nary capital. Much, of course, depends on
the stocktaking: and from the fact that there
was scarcely a tremor in the profits in 1921,
when prices slumped badly, one can judge
that the management holds itself well in
hand when it overhauls its shelves. The pre-
sent capital is £200,000 in 6 p.c. first prefs.,
£175,000 in 7-J p.c. second prefs., and
£250,000 in ordinaries; and prefs., whose
slogan is “Safety first,” can see £795.958
of assets (net) to guarantee their £375,000;
while profits one-third the size of last year’s
would with a squeeze pay their dividends.
The shares in other cos. (£149,310) are in-
terests in Bon Marche (Sydney) and Marcus
Clark (Vic.), Ltd., and there may be some
reserves in those concerns not included in
this figure.

At the annual meeting in ’23 a warning was
given that, if the fierce competition con-
tinued, loss would result. Evidently it did;
for the directors report that, in order to
retain its positibn in the trade, the co. had
to sell stocks at serious loss. This little
war has raged between the associated and
independent timber merchants for some time,
and price reductions at the wholesale end of
the business have added to the trouble.
Oregon is the line around which most of
the price-cutting has centred, and cargoes
are being landed at as much as 25 p.c. under
1923 prices. The loss disclosed by this co.
was due partly to the writing-down of stocks.
Rightly, the directors decided to clean up the
trouble immediately rather than store up
future worry by carrying stocks at high
values. To meet the position most of the
reserves were absorbed.
The movements disclosed on the year
with comparisons back to 1914, are: —

Since the post-war boom, when much reck-
less building activity by Governments and
others was indulged in throughout Australia,
the co. has made meagre profits; and even
in the boom it could not do better than a
10 p.c. div. for one term. Since then cheaper
Oregon has meant less demand for small
hardwood sizes—one of the co.’s specialties—
and that position shows little sign of alter-
ing. Against liabilities of £59,966 there are
£94,755 of liquid and semi-liquid assets. A
re-organisation scheme inspires the directors
with hope for the future; there is not much
discernible brightness otherwise.

help him much. In the latter half of 1917
the co. bought a Fremantle hotel. Since
then the position has changed as follows: —
Dec.,’l7. June,’24.
Liquid assets .. £22,433 £18,005
Liabilities . . 28,650 28,074
Excess liabilities £6,217 £10,069
That doesn’t look good, especially as no div.
was paid for a while. But meantime a
bundle of other assets —freeholds, plant, roll-
ing-stock and goodwill of unknown size—
has gone from £136,268 to £175,057. “Main-
tenance” has been charged in with manu-
facturing and trade exes. ; and a “deprecia-
tion insurance reserve” has been built up out
of the amounts shown as written off. Pro-
bably that isn’t a true reserve. But
an “equalisation reserve” has improved
by £19,211 in the 61 years, and that
looks real enough ; if it is, then there is a
fair margin between net profit and dividend
—a trifle over £6OO per half-year since the
71 p.c. div. began. If the amount shown
as written off is in excess of requirements,
of course the position is still better. But
on that point the Wild Cat knows nothing.
Joe Hollow, one of the few prospectors
who go out into uninviting back country to
work, has struck something promising near
the north and south rabbit-proof fence, 60
miles south of Burracoppin, on the Perth-
Ivalgoorlie railway. Owing to scarcity of
water, the district is not a picnic-ground,
but Hollow has hung on and sunk a shaft,
and at 40ft. has cut a lode 2ft. wide assaying
2oz. The small amount of work done points
to the possibility of Westralia’s hoped-for
new find having been made at last.
* * * *
Westralia has a coalfield at Wilga, near
Collie, which State Mining Engineer Mont-
gomery estimates may contain 200,000,000
tons spread over 24 square miles. The coal
so far exposed is as good as Collie, and
the field is as favorably situated in the
matter of railway. But while the existing
system of high prices, low outputs and
sharing of (mostly Government) trade by
arrangement instead of by competition per-
sists at Collie, it would be risky if not
foolish, according to Montgomery, for any-
body to open up new collieries in the State.
He adds that the Wilga field can, therefore,
only be regarded as a national asset for
future development.

South Mighty Atom, an Adelaide no lia-
bility weakling, announces that it has taken
a sampling option on Burbanks Oversight
at Coolgardie (W.A.). As a good man has
been asked to express an opinion, it should
not be long before the option is thrown up.
* * * *
Boulder Perseverance (W.A.) recently
bought a quarter share in the Boulder No.
1 leases, and has now added the small Bank
of England block. In the early days the
“Bank” was rushed by a London co. as a
real good thing, and, on the strength of a
rich patch of oxidised ore, shares soared to
£6. But the shoot proved too short to be of
much value and petered out in depth. Then
the market collapsed and the show passed
into other hands. Since then it has produced
a little gold irregularly. The deepest work-
ings are at about 1300 ft.
* * * *
Sons of Gwalia has extracted over
£lOO,OOO from its Westralian mine and
dumps this year, and there is some talk of
an early div. No costs are published, nor is
anything said about the appearance of the
mine. Without this information it is im-
possible to say whether the deep mining now
being carried on in the property is likely to
prove successful or merely a flash in the pan.
* * * *
The patient call-paying shareholders of
Ives Reward (W.A.) are about to get a run
for their money. The battery will commence
milling this month, and, owing to accumu-
lation of broken ore, operations for the first
few weeks are likely to show a profit. After
that the outlook will not be encouraging;
values are too erratic.
“Lookout”: I had a look at the Monte
Carlo Bank, at Cue (W.A.), and found the
remnant of a short and shallow pocket of
rich ore. Prospects of finding anything fur-
ther of value are remote, as the spot is sur-
rounded by workings of former unsuccessful
gold-hunters. Option-holders have been
granted a month’s extension, and when this
expires the mine should be returned to the
owners without any addition to the 10s.
which the. latter received from the option-
takers as deposit.

A small party of miners are draining the
workings of the Fingall (W.A.) in the hope
of a speedy and glorious resurrection. Twice
before attempts to raise the old show from
the dead have failed, but the present one is
confidently expected to succeed.
* * * *
Macdonnell Ranges Co. continue to issue
development reports which speak of widths
of sft. averaging 30dwt. at a depth of 30ft.
Such developments will do, but as shares
are selling at Gd. something is amiss some-
where. The mine manager swears his figures
are right.
United Mount Painter Radium Co., NX.,
has been registered in 100,000 £1 shares to
take over 15 leases from an Adelaide syndi-
cate, and three from Radium and Rare
Earths Co., of Melbourne. From No. 6 shaft,
100 ft. deep, ore sent to London realised
£4OO a ton. Subsequently No. 7 shaft was
sunk 27ft. with a drive of 15ft. These
workings were the richest on the field, and
there was a quantity of rich ore in sight.
Douglas Mawson and two trained assistants
have left for the field, which is 70 miles east
of Copley, on the Oodnadatta line. Fred
Tricks handles the ribbons in Melbourne.

Somebody has found or is alleged to have
found a few specks of gold in Fitzroy; and
in a week when news threatened to be slack
the discovery has been turned into a sensa-
tion. There is, of course, no commercial
significance about it whatever, Melbourne
having been thoroughly explored by water
and sewerage costeens and tunnels and lift-
wells ; but it will make good advertising
material in England.

A bit of old Bendigo to which George
Lansell long clung was his Little 180 mine,
on the Slieepshead line. At shallow levels it
was a splendid producer. Now it is to be
tested at 878 ft., where a narrow run of stone
carries payable quartz. The importance of
work on this stone is that it may point the
way for both Ironbark and the Central Blue
to another profitable run of quartz.
* * * *
Mt. Isa Mines has got two shafts down
180 ft., one on the Isa and the other on the
Black Star, and galena has come into both
in the last few feet. Silver values have
improved with the change; a sample of the
Star galena assayed 3300 z., much the best
silver assay for a long time. Whether this
galena represents the start of the sulphide zone
is still doubtful. It looks as if the fate of
the field as a silver-producer hangs on what
the. next 50ft. of sinking shows; on develop-
ment work to the 150 ft. level it is conspicu-
ously a lead field, with, the exception of the
Black Rock lode, which carries very fair
silver values over an average width of 15ft.
The carbonate ores have been particularly
lean as regards silver. It was quite other-
wise at Broken Hill; but, then, deposits
could scarcely be more dissimilar in occur-
rence and mineral association. The latest
assay of galena ore is very good, and, if it
proves any index to silver values in the pri-
mary ores, the field promises to fulfil the
first predictions of the experts as a silver
producer. The striking of the Black Rock in
the Prop.’s No. 2 shaft has proved the exten-
sion of this fine lode through the length of the
big co.’s lease.
* * * *
No. 2 North Phoenix, Gympie (Q.), has
succeeded in locating a little more ore than
formerly, and crushings are coming along re-
gularly now, with values fluctuating greatly.
The ore put through last week, although
below recent averages, gave the nice return
of 3460 z. from 160 tons. The reef, always
small, has opened out slightly, and is averag-
ing Gin. to 9in. in the workings below the
784 ft. level, with good gold showing in
patches. This permits of picking, and the
“Wild Cat” tips that there will be a nice
little clean-up for shareholders round about
Christmas-time.
* * * *
Neither of the two seams in the Hartley
shaft on the Styx (Q.) coalfield come up to
the seam in the old mine for either thickness
or quality. The latter is still producing the
best coal on the field ; but the jumbling up
of the seam makes the cost almost prohibi-
tive. The top seam in the Hartley, recently
opened out, gave trouble to the locos, by
clinkering badly; hence abandonment and the
continuation of the bore to 770 ft., where a
4ft. seam was struck. The latter coal is
O.K. as regards clinker, but 4ft. is not much
of a thickness to roly on at 800 ft.. and it is
not yet known whether even this much
holds for any distance around the shaft.
* * * *
It is regrettable that F. G. Clapp was not
induced to visit Western Queensland. The
country there has given more positive evi-
dence of the presence of petroleum than any
other part of the Commonwealth. In view
of the existence of wet gas (produc-
ing petrol) at Roma, the drops of liquid
petroleum in the Warbreccan, Ruthven and
Bimerah bores, and the inspissated wax from
the Springleigh deep bore at 5800 ft., thor-
ough search is loudly called for; and the
effort of one company in that vast country
to strike oil is akin to looking for a needle
in many haystacks. This fact is punched
home by the large percentage of dry holes
in America, notwithstanding that many
American bores are put down around known
producing areas. If. for example, the Lan-
der new bore at Orallo does not strike pay-
able oil, what inference can be drawn? Cer-
tainly not that the formation to be tested
does not contain payable oil. There are not
pools in every part of an oil-bearing district.
The pronouncement of Clapp on this area
—potentially oil-bearing, at least—if favor-
able would have given an impetus to the
search; if unfavorable it would have saved
a lot of spasmodic yet costly effort.
* * * *
Randolph Bedford’s rejoinder :
I shouldn’t reply to the anonymous “Shareholder”—
apparently of Blair Athol coal-mine—except to
remark that he lies by insinuation. He admits that
coal-costs at Townsville are lower since Bowen
State mine opened, but says this is only “in a
very slight degree because of lower working costs,
and is mainly a saving in freight from Newcastle.”
That isn’t true ; but if it were the shipping cos.—
another beneficent expression of Private Enterprise
—could have kept up the cost but for the State
railways. “Shareholder” says “Mr. Bedford doubt
less knows” that the Bowen State miners will pre-
vent a repetition of last year's profit. Not only do
I not “doubtless know” the alleged fact, but nobody
else knows it either. I said that a mixture of
Styx and Baralaba (both State) is better loco fuel
than Blair Athol. He says that conclusion is the
result of “laboratory tests on a limited scale.” The
statement rs based not on laboratory tests, but on
loco, practice. Nobody questions the value of Blair
Athol coal; the long haulage to the coast and to
coastal railway centres is the trouble, and roaring
against more conveniently situated State mines will
not alter the fact.

The report of the first fortnight’s crushing
at the Crown, Mudgee (N.S.W*.), is a provo-
cative document. Only 170 of the 800 tons
nominated for reduction during the month
had passed through the mill. “Numerous
stoppages occurred, chiefly due to defects in
the electrical department.” It agrees with
the market view of the 7s. 6d. shares : these
are assessed at 25., as against 3s. 6d. when
the talk about 800 tons for the month was at
its loudest.
Subscribers of the 50,000 prefs. in Haw-
kins Hill (N.S.W.), paid to 3d., were elated
when buyers on ’Change offered 9d. and sellers
held aloof. But the shock of a 3d. call for
November sobered the selling quote to Gd.,
and buyers cleared out. Manager E. R. Cock
fathered a circular intimating his faith in
the ultimate issue when the Star of Peace
shaft has been timbered and cages supplied.
He anticipates a reduction of expenses by
half when direct haulage to the surface has
been provided for. At present stuff broken
from the mica vein in the drive from the
950 ft. level has to be hauled to the SOOft.,
there trucked 1200 ft. along the Amalgamated
tunnel, and then carted 800 ft. to the battery.
Cock forecasts supplementary yields under the
new order from the 400, 650 and 850 feet
levels.

Eastern Gold, Siam, has 700 contribs. paid
to fS and 500 vendors’ paid to £lO. The
scrip is making a tidy premium in Pitt-street,
the show being well backed and Siam rather
in the boom. Cables continue to report
assays from the Thomo options, said to be
taken from widely divergent points over a
large area, ranging from 22dwt. to 70dwt.
The co. holds ample ground—“over 500 sq.
miles” was mentioned in the prospectus—and,
if consulting-engineer A. P. Penman gives
the area his blessing, there should be a whole
litter of pup floats.

Nawng Pet Tin Co., F.M.S., recovered
370 tons tin oxide from 386,000 cubic yards
in its last year (to March 31), and showed a
net profit of £26.592 on a working capital
of £58,333. The directors had £33,607 avail-
able after bringing in £7102, and share-
holders got £11,628 in two payments of 10
p.c. each. The cash balance of £22,000 at
the end of March has had some handsome
additions. So far the boring chart has
been bettered: a yardage of 760.000 produc-
ing 629 tons oxide averaged 1.85 d. a yard
compared with 1.481 b. estimated in the pros-
pectus. Nine acres of the 177 comprising the
area have been worked, the remaining yard-
age being estimated at 6,240,000. No. 2 dam,
1200 ft. above the mine, has been completed,
and should insure the co. against periodical
water shortages, which hitherto have been
eminently useful to bear operators.
* * * *
Tin Bentong lias struck easy ground and
more tin than Ambrose Pratt expected. The
result is 194 f tons oxide from 789,000 cub. yds.
of drift. He is enthusiastic because the 1941
tons of oxide won in the old ground and on
the way to the new lease brought in £23,907,
which not only covered all costs of the trans-
fer of the plant, but gave £2OOO as a profit.
The co. therefore gets its second start with
the new area paid- for and the plant at
work upon it without cash reserves being
depleted.

“J.H.M.A.”: Like the Burning Mountain
at Wingen (N.S.W.), the Alum Mountain at
Bullahdelah, on the upper waters of the
Myall River, is a geological freak. It is a
ridge of alunite, three miles long and reach-
ing a height of just under 1000 ft., formed
by the folding of a series of sandstone and
lava sheets. The subsequent chemical action
of steam and sulphurous vapors, caused by
the intrusion of dolorite dykes, has con-
verted the rhyolites into alunite, and the
softer sandstones have been removed by
denudation, leaving the anticlinal arch of
harder alunite to form the summit of the
range. A great quantity of the picturesque
crags has been exported to England—gener-
ally as ballast for wool-ships—where it is
first put through dehydrating furnaces, then
treated with weak sulphuric acid in lead-
lined vats heated to boiling point, and run
off into crystallising tanks. The crystal
alum is finally washed and refined. For
some time past the mountain has been ex-
ploited by a co., and there is a considerable
quantity of stone at grass on the east bank
of the Myall; but at present, owing to the
state of the market, operations are slack.
From a scenic point of view the surroundings
of Bullahdelah are magnificent. The writer
has looked out from many high summits in
Australia and elsewhere, but cannot recall
any that give a more beautiful panorama than
that which may be seen from the top of the
Alum Mountain on a clear day.

she must be very close
to it. She saw the
light at Gawler-place.
Adelaide, in 1838, and
was christened a t
Trinity Church, on
North-terrace, where
her parents were mar-
ried. Her husband,
dead 25 years ago, was
a nurseryman at
Houghton, and the
couple had a family of
eight daughters and
nine sons —seven sons
and six daughters are
still living. The old
lady still chases the
snails in her garden.
Zinovieff, the clumsy gentleman whose
letter re the white-anting of the British
forces caused a fuss at the British elections,
is really named Apfelbaum, unless he was
something else before lie was Apfelbaum. In
like manner Trotsky is Bronstein and Lenin
was Ulianoff. The reason for taking throne
names as Popes do, or pen-names as story-
writers do, has never been explained, but it
may arise from the habit of dodging the
police in childhood.
Rev. F. C. Birch, chaplain of H.M.A.S.
Sydney, who conducted the service on Sunday
commemorating the 10th anniversary of the
Australian flagship’s destruction of the
Emden—it was raiding the cable station on
Cocos Island at the time—began life in the
Eastern Extension Telegraph Co. himself.
After pushing dots and dashes through the
old Flinders-Georgetown cable linking Vic.
and Tassie, he was transferred to La
Perouse, the co.’s station on Botany Bay,
where he worked the landline to Sydney. He
exchanged lightning-jerking for sky-piloting
15 years ago, and saw war service as chap-
lain on the Australia. He shifted his sea-
chest from the training-ship Tingira to the
Emden’s Nemesis the other day.
Archgaiters Julius, who has bished at
Christchurch (M.L.) for 34 years, is making
way for a younger man. He is now 77.
Prior to undertaking the job of keeping the
Flat City in the straight and narrow path
he was Archdeacon of Ballarat, and from
that city he carried away some liberal ideas
which for a while shocked the Maorilanders.
He has a son who already is an archdeacon,
and his father has an excellent chance of
seeing him made a bishop.
“T. 0.1.”: Randolph Bedford’s story of
big-hearted Jim Gannon, Iv.C., reminds me
of another. _ Some years ago a friend of his
had the bailiffs in his house over a matter
of a few pounds. He sent a chum to Jim,
who was in court. Jim at once felt in his
pockets, but had no coin. He couldn’t leave
the court, so lie took his gold watch and
chain from his pocket and told the chum
to pop them for the amount needed.
“Oxmead” : Politicians, for more reasons
than one, could hardly be expected to figure
prominently in a “record-shout” competition
(B. 6/11/’24), but when Ned Wittenoom
(now President of Groperland’s Legislative
Council) accepted the Agency-General in
1897, he probably put up a record for his
class. Delivering a farewell address to his
constituents at Geraldton, his final remark
was that he was sorry he couldn’t ask his
audience to have a collective drink with him,
but he had sent a cheque for £3 to every
pub in the town to be devoted as far as pos-
sible to that end. I think there were seven
licensed houses, and they all did a brisk trade
for a few minutes that night.
In standing aside to let John Allan, the
Cocky leader, conduct the attack on the Vic.
Labor Government, Alex. Peacock has plenty
of precedent behind him. He himself was a
witness when Duncan Gillies gave place to
J. B. Patterson so that Shiels could be
shifted (Jan., 1893). And John Mclntyre,
the then Opposition Leader, concurred, in
1899, when McLean, from the Ministerial
side, threw the bomb that scattered the first
Turner team. All the same, it would have
been a pleasure to see Peacock win a pitched
battle cn the floor of the House and gain
the Premiership as a reward. He has been
head of the Vic. Government three times, but
every time the Premiership has been laid in
his lap by out-going colleagues (Turner, ’01;
Watt, T 4, and Lawson, ’24).
Downward, wdio did all he could to block
an attack on Vic.’s Labor Ministry, has been
deputy-captain of the Hayseeds’ team since
July. He has been 30 years in the Assem-
bly, and for 25 of them was a Lib.:
he went over to the Farmers about the same
time as Bowser. Since 1894 he has been
in two Ministries, but his total term in
office (under Bent and Bowser respectively)
has been only six months. He has been, in
fact, a sort of Cabinet Jonah. Being 76, he
is five years older than Prendergast, the out-
going Premier. When Downward licked
£ £ Smith for Mornington 30 years ago, the
doctor petitioned, and briefed David Gaun-
son, his old colleague in the O’Loghlen team,
to represent him before the Elections and
Qualifications Committee. Unaided by coun-
sel, Farmer Downward won handsomely. £ £
never got into politics again.
Dr. R. E. Harrold, just dead at 59, was
one of S.A.’s best-known doctoi\s. Adelaide
born, he studied medicine at Edinburgh, and
under Morrell McKenzie at Bart.’s, London.
He mixed specialism in skin diseases with
many outside hobbies, including carnations,
dogs and bowls.
Frank Makin, just dead in Adelaide at 82,
came from England as a young man in 1868.
and acquired pastoral interests which allowed
him to spend most of his time in the city.
Military matters were his one hobby, and
with his English experience lie was a pillar
of strength to the local force. He came
most into the limelight when, as honorary
A.D.C. to Governor Tennyson (afterwards
G.-G.), he attended the opening of the first
Federal Parliament.
Spoonerisms are by no means rare in Aus-
tralian Legislatures, but for malapropisms
a member of the Speck Parliament is in a
class of his own. The other day he told his
audience that a certain political party should
be “all alive to seize the zoological moment.”
Discussing a dangerous railway crossing he
assured the ’Ouse that “nobody wanted the
Government to be mutilated in damages.”
An older but equally well authenticated
gem attributed to the same politician is that
“Billy Hughes has never been any good to
the Australian workers since he went ’Ome
fertilisin’ with dooks and duchesses.”
William King, brother of Thomas, a former
owner of the S.A. Advertiser, died in Mel-
bourne the other day, a patriarch of 86.
Half a century ago he was a timber-merchant
in Adelaide and' an unsuccessful law-action
which filled the papers of the time did him
no good financially. An early investor in
S. Aus. lands left his properties to his
tenants when he died. William King had
been the tenant of a very valuable city pro-
perty when the will was made, and he con-
tended that it was the tenants at that date
whom the landlord had in mind. He backed
his judgment right up to the Privy Council,
which decided that the properties must go
to the tenants at the time of the owner’s
death.
After 70-odd years in Australia Bernard
Gaffney has called it a day. Born in Cavan,
Ireland, 94 years ago, he joined the refugees
of the Famine and the National movement,
and with Dr. O’Doherty and Duffy came to
TV. A. SELLE, the new Registrar of
Sydney Uni.
Australia. The lure of the Turon caught
him for a while, but finally coming to Sydney
he set up as a baker in Castlereagli-street.
He was an active participator in all things
Irish—treasurer of the Fenian Aid move-
ment, associate of the Redmonds in their
Home Rule mission, and one of the founders
and first president of the Hibernian Lodge.
Though a thorn in the late Inspector-General
Fosbery’s side through insisting on holding
Hibernian processions, he yet preserved a
singularly placid disposition.
Memories of the foul murder of Sergeant
Michael Kennedy and Mounted-constables
Scanlan and Lonigan by the Kelly gang, in
the Wombat Ranges (Vic.), were revived
lasti week when Mrs. Bridget Kennedy,
widow of the sergeant, passed out after draw-
ing for 46 years the salary paid to her hus-
band at the time of his death —about £lO,OOO
altogether. She was buried alongside him in
Mansfield cemetery.
Prendergast, Vic.’s Labor Premier, was
suspended 27 years ago because he refused
to obey the order of F. C. Mason, Chairman
of Committees, and say whether references
he had made to “dishonorable transactions
of 1893” referred to any members then sitting
in Opposition. Isaac Isaacs, now a High
Court Judge, who was leading the House as
George Turner’s Attorney-General, submitted
the motion for suspension, which was carried
by 39 votes to 5. As the House adjourned
for the night a quarter of an hour or so
afterwards, Prendergast suffered very little
inconvenience from his stubborn attitude.
When John Francis Hennessy died re-
cently at 71 in a Sydney suburb, Australia’s
outstanding ecclesiastical architect passed
hence. He studied in Leeds, his birthplace,
and spent some time in Spain and the
IT.S.A. before coming to Australia 45 years
ago as assistant city architect in Sydney.
He was responsible for the plans of the pre-
sent Town Hall, and with ,T. I. Sheerin built
the R.C. College at Manly and the additions
to St. Mary’s Cathedral. Many other pro-
minent R.C. institutions followed. As a side-
line he helped to design Labor’s model
suburb of Daeeyville, and as president of the
N. S. Wales Institute of Architects he helped
to establish a Chair of Architecture at
Sydney University. About five years ago the
Pope mailed him the order of Knight of St.
Sylvester.
Samuel Leon, Iv. C.. Vie. Crown Prosecu-
tor and occasional Judge, celebrates his
jubilee as a barrister on December 9 next.
The next oldest practising Victorian pleader
is L. S. Woolf, who has been at the bar for
48 years.
A Bulletin correspondent recently debited
G. H. Wise with 75 years, which is four
too many. At 71 the good Australian still
tramps to and from his office a mile from
his house, as erect and vigorous as ever;
fights his Court cases with as much vim as of
yore; canters all over Gippsland at the
slightest pretext, and generally keeps him-
self fit for the time when the Bruce-Page
crowd go to the country—and then the
Cocky candidate can look out!
A cable message says that Mrs. Millicent
ni ll oio g Aon lst T, m ' law of George Salting, left
£1.,868,006. lhe foundations of this trifling
competency were laid in Sydney. Flower,
Salting and Co. were in Hunter-street 80-odd
years ago; the Union Rank Chambers stand
on the site of their stores and counting-house.
The Cliallis University bequest came, from
the same source.
When H. J. M. Campbell was member for
Glenelg in the Vic. Assembly, and an Honor-
ary Minister under Lawson, he was gener-
ally regarded as one of the wealthy men of
the House: he was alleged to have made a
big pile while storekeeping at Portland. A
trustee co. has been trying to do the best
with his estate since he passed out nearly
three years ago, and has now to own up
that liabilities exceeded assets by £2000; and
the assets were only £17,000.
E. E. Clarke, owner of the Oaks winner
Petunia and one of the least conspicuous of
the late baronet William Clarke’s family,
has a model stud-farm at Melton, 30 miles
out of Melbourne. Though he has bred
countless winners, he rarely goes to a
race meeting. He is as sparing of words as
he is free with money, and his “boys” at the
stables vote him a “good slinger.” His big, ram-
bling homestead, where cigars and cigarettes
are kept in huge boxes like sea-chests, offers
the most generous hospitality, whether the
host is there or not. The housekeeper has
orders to “do” his cronies handsomely if
they turn up. Standing loosely about one
room he has hundreds of paintings, sketches
and other portraits of famous horses that
have belonged to the Clarke clan.
Robert Sommerville, the Grand Old Man
of Auckland Presbyterianism, has just
passed on, aged 85. Born in Perthshire, he
arrived in Maoriland in 1863, and ’way back
in 1872 edited the Presbyterian Maga-
zine. He was made Clerk of the Presby-
tery in 1879, and held the job till his death
—a record length of service in such a billet
for Australasia.
The election of John Longstaff as presi-
dent of Victorian Artists’ Society will help
to remove the stigma of dilettantism from
that body. Longstaff has mixed a good deal
of soldiering with his long artistic career:
he was in the Boer War, and concerned him-
self also in the latest upheaval. Fraternising
with some S. African “others” in a London pub
he mentioned a particularly hot time during
the relief of Willamore in the Boer War.
One of the Springboks agreed that the reliev-
ing Australians had had a warm time —he
knew because he had been one of the Boers
in ambush who were firing upon them.
“If you were with them, how is it that you
are wearing this?” questioned Longstaff,
pointing to the S’African ribbon on the
Dutchman’s breast. The Springbok grinned.
“Well, why shouldn’t I wear it?” he chal-
lenged. “I was in the war, wasn’t I?"
Nearly 40 years ago the brothers Moore
crossed over the Murray from the Wimmera
(Vic.) to take up the property they called
Moorelands, in the Moree black-soil terri-
tory. Just-dead Thomas Fitzgerald Moore
took up Whalan station soon after, and be-
came one of the first members of the local
Shire Council. He varied pastoral pursuits
with a little inky-wayfaring, and some time
back printed the story of a world-trip. .

ALDERMANIC FEELING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“At the Cropley commission Lord Mayor Gilpin,
while denying that party differences in the Sydney City
Council meant personal "animosities, admitted that
aldermanic feeling was stronger than the sentiments
entertained by ordinary individuals towards one an-
other.”
A frame that’s eloquent of weight, a face of conscious
worth,
A gradually baldening crown, a gently widening
girth—
These are among the attributes that mark the aider-
man ;
But never think that they exhaust the outfit of the
clan.
Deem not no passions primitive, no lusty hates, may
lurk
Beneath the appetite for unremunerated work
And banquets where down napkined necks the turtle
soup is hurled,
Or whatsoever corresponds thereto this side the world.
The stern delight that warriors feel when facing
worthy foes,
The animus with which a pug lands on his rival’s
nose,
Are far from incompatible, be sure, with thirst
intense
For civic weal and whisky at the ratepayers’ expense.
That placid-looking brow from which benevolence
exudes
Is housing, you may bet, a brain obsessed by faction
feuds ;
E’en owl-like sapience doesn’t prove the wearer
wouldn’t slay
The colleague sitting next to him if he could have
his way.
Dislikes as well as loves you’ll have if you’re an
average man,
And you can hate your enemy—at least, you think
you can.
But all the loathing that you feel, the wrath you’d
like to wreak,
The bitterness with which you burn, are pallid things
and weak
Beside an alderman’s toward the opposition clique.

It is just over 36 years ago since the Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre gave a great
impetus to cycling and then later made the automobile possible. Had it not
been for the late J. B. Dunlop there would not be nearly 16,000,000 cars
in the world to-day, nor would motoring be as comfortable and economical
as it is. During the whole of that period the name Dunlop has been pre-
eminent in the tyre world setting the standard for quality, value and service.

“Anyways, we're getting a second storey on our house.”
“Gam, my dad says we're getting a third mortgage!”
“Imbaga”: “Parama” can rest assured that
the stone ballast he found in his Papuan crocodile
(B. 23/10/’24) is always found when a post mortem
is held on any of the family, including the gavials
and the ’gators. Crocs, and their relations feed by
biting off big chunks of their prey, or swallowing
it whole, if small enough; that is why, if he
captures anything big, the croc, likes to let it
ripen to a comfortable softness before he rings
the dinner-bell. The stones are an aid to the
digestion of the large masses gulped down, and not
to keep their host on an even keel, as was once
supposed. These stones are ejected if occasion
arises; the process has been noted among croco-
diles in captivity.
“Six and Eight” : It is almost certain that
the cattle tick was brought to Australia by the
Indian cattle “Troophorse” mentions (B. 16/10/’24).
In 1872, the settlement at Darwin (then Palmerston)
being short of beef, the British Australian Cable Co.
imported 12 Indian cattle (eight cows and four bulls)
from Batavia, where the tick is a common parasite
of cattle. These cattle were afterwards taken to
the Adelaide River, where they bred up to six or
seven hundred head. The original importations must
have been tick-infested, for all their crossbred de-
scendants, when examined years later, were found to
be covered with ticks. The buffalo, though long
under suspicion, must be acquitted of introducing the
pest, because they are to-day free from the parasite.
This is so even when the buffalo graze on the same
land as cattle which are seriously infested.
* * * •
“Bactermnnta”: I can support “FY7”
(B. 23/10/’24) concerning the vagaries of the ful-
minate of mercury detonator. Twenty years ago the
magazine on the old Yelta mine, near Moonta, was a
mile away in the scrub, and it was the job of
Johnny Tregilgas to bring in the daily supply of
“fracteur” in a spring dray. He used to come jog-
ging along the rough track seated on the “con-
densed energy,” and with a couple of tins of
detonators in the pocket of his shirt. One day an
extra-heavy bump shot one of the fulminate tins into
the fairway, and after Dobbin had kicked it once
or twice, the wheel of the dray squashed it flat.
Nothing happened. A few days later the storeman
at Wallaroo Mines was using a chisel to rip the zinc
lining of a case of detonators. At least, it seems a
fair inference that he was thus employed, because
when the wrecked building was examined they found
the chisel and his thumb embedded in one of the
rafters.
* * * *
“Bouragi”: Though “Homfrey Beale” re-
asserts (B. 9/10/’24) that the practice of burial in
central plots was “quite common” on the Kumusi
and Upper Kumusi until “40 years ago,” it certainly
was not when I first knew that country in the early
days of this century. Burial under the houses was
then the rule, and I have every reason to remember
its persistence, even as far up the Kumusi as the
Mount Lamington foothills. They could not be “chiefs”
who huried their relatives under houses, for there
were no “chiefs” in that communistic society and
are none to-day. One must go far up the slopes
of the dividing range to find either burying-plots
or the beginnings of the “chief” idea.
* * * *
“8.8. C.”: 11. A. Longman, curator of the
Queensland Museum, made a trip to Marmor (C.Q.)
during the recent ornithologists’ conference, and in the
limestone quarries there discovered some rare fossils.
The now-buried caves had evidently been the haunt of
the Queensland cousin of the Tasmanian devil.
Though fossils of this animal had been found on the
Darling Downs, except at Mt. Etna (C.Q.) none had
been found further north.
* * * *
“Duau”: Leprosy was reported in New
Guinea by the earliest visitors,
and probably was there when
Torres coasted its southern shores
on his way to the strait that now
bears his name. But “X2X” (B.
2/10/’24) slips in saying that “iu
effort is ever made to isolate
sufferers from it.” Away back in
1896 the writer visited the north-
ern end of Fergusson Island, in
the middle of the D’Entrecasteaux
Group, and was astounded to dis-
cover several cases of the awful
malady isolated in a small-hamlet
on a ridge about a mile away from
the nearest village. Inquiries
elicited that “people with rotting
skin arc always made to live by
themselves.” In this tiny com-
munity there were four men and
their wives, with three children.
Two of the women showed no sign
of being affected, but lived there
because they wished to be with
their husbands. The children ap-
peared healthy and as robust as
the average native kids in the
parent village. It is incredible to
me that these people can have
learnt their system of quarantine
from white men; they were wild
and had been visited by whites
only two or three times before my
arrival. It is strange how nearly
every observer of primitive man
tries to argue that customs like
this must be of foreign origin:
actually, the whole world over, or
nearly so, primitive man has
evohed a host of social laws and
customs that are identical with
those of so-called civilisation.
“Tainornie”: I disagree with “Enfo” (B.
23/10/’24) about the Tassy blacks spinning the spear
in their fingers for “a few moments” before casting.
1 have had a lot of experience with abos. and
kanakas; many of the latter also throw the spear
without the aid of a womera. The spin is imparted
by a sharp pull or flick with the thumb across the
shaft at the instant of release, or in the opposite
direction with the tips of the fingers. As a youngster
I had as playmates young niggers whose elders took
a delight in instructing me in the use of their
weapons. As for the penetrative power of weapons
thrown in this manner, I have often seen a hole
nunched in a sheet of corrugated-iron at 25 yards.
“Itineris”: We were busy stacking wheat
for shipment on the Port Victoria jetty (S.A.).
Bussie, a driver, was returning to the stack, his old
horse, a fine draught that had been with him in the
AT THE SPIRITUALISTIC SEANCE.
MEDIUM: “What do you wish to say to your mother?”
WIDOW: “Tell ’or me ’usband’s dead, an’ ask ’er ter keep an eye
on ’im till I yet there.”
same job for months, following in harness behind him.
Bussie was walking close to the edge, and a playful
push from the nose of his four-footed offsider was
sufficient to upset him into the ditch. For a moment
the horse gazed at Bussie’s disappearing figure, and
then dived gallantly to his rescue. The distance to
shore was only a hundred yards or so, and either
could have been relied on to make the distance quite
easily; but Bussie got so helplessly mixed up with
the harness, and Prince was so intent on sticking to
Bussie, that had help not been forthcoming there
would probably have been a double drowning fatality.
It was months before Bussie was able to go back to
his work. Ever since it happened I have been won-
dering whether the horse was prompted by a desire to
repair the mischief he had wrought, or whether he
simply thought that where Bussie went he had to
follow’.
* * * *
“T.W.D.”: Golf hath its dangers no less
renowned than ping-pong. The other day a Vic.
North-country player found his ball surrounded by
five feet of brown snake. He smashed his mashie
and the snake’s back simultaneously. In his last
moments r.ve’s old friend complained bitterly that
he had been the victim of a confidence trick.
* * * *
“Broome”: I can tell “Notesoeg” (B.
11/9/’24) liow it is that immature
m.o.p. shells are often found cast
up at high-water mark. I have seen
them strewn along the beaches of
the north-west coast of W.A. for
hundreds of yards, but only after
a severe local storm or after heavy
swells caused by’ storms or seismic
disturbances north of our coast. The
oyster which produces the world’s
most wonderful white pearl spawns
during the season, and millions of
eggs float down cn the tide. Many
become the prey of fish, but a few
come to roost on any old thing
that is fast to the bottom of the
ocean. They may attach to sea-
weed, coral ferns, shells protruding
from the sandy bed of the sea
anything. Their early growth is
rapid ; and when a storm comes or
a heavy swell from over sea, the
younger and weaker shells are torn
from their often unsafe anchorages,
and with the natural action of the
tide are cast up on the beach. Once having broken
adrift the beard will not attach again.
* * * *
“Nikko” : An ambitious ewe on a farm at
Waverley, near Wellington (MX.), achieved five
lambs the other day. Surely this is something of
a record? A few years ago there was an epidemic
of twin lambs, two in the family being almost as
common as a single one. 1 saw then an old ewe
with triplet black lambs who seemed quite aware
of the interest her unusual trio created.
“Jesmond”: It is difficult to understand
why Vic. has declared 1924 a close season for
mutton-bird eggs. The fear of extermination is
unwarranted, though admittedly there has been' a
falling off in the num-
ber of birds nesting on
Phillip Island during
recent years. This may,
however, be accounted
for by the warrens
getting constantly filled
up by the fine sand on
the rookeries —mutton-
birds are lazy and are
perhaps seeking less
troublesome nesting-
places elsewhere. Or
foxes, which have
greatly increased since
their introduction some
years ago, may be the
cause. It certainly is
not due to “eggers,”
for in the past few
years their number has
gradually decreased,
due more to the limi-
tation of egging hours
and the imposition of
a fee than to any fall
ing off in the number
of birds. Anyway,
what good are the birds
if one cannot make use
of the eggs or young?
Certainly they present
a wonderful spectacle
at sundown when they
return to the rookeries
in their thousands —i
neve r-to-be-forgotten
sight, and one of the
many’ attractions of the
island.
* *
“F.A.G.”: At-
tended a funeral at
Gordonvale, near
Cairns (N.Q.). Among
46 ears attending there
was only one “Tin
Liz.” (Incidentally,
“Lizzie” refused to
spark, and had to be
towed off the road)
On a picture night it
is the proud boast of
the inhabitants that in
a whole street-length of
parked cars there is no single buzzer valued under
£500: Surely tnis should be an inducement to go
north, young man.
* * * *
“Colub” : Along parts of the New Guinea
coast there is a sea-snake which does not breed in
the sea, but selects a spot a short distance inland,
generally a swamp close to the water’s edge. When
the mating season approaches all the reptiles in the
vicinity make for this place, and before long the
spot is literally alive with the vermin. Not far
from Hollandia, in the Dutch Territory, I saw one
of these breeding-“grounds.” Though it was early
in the season there were scores of the reptiles squirm-
ing in the ooze between a swamp and the bank of a
creek. They are extremely vicious at such a time,
and a man who was unfortunate enough to blunder
among them would have a poor chance.
“Parama”: I'm satisfied that pearls don’t
breed. I’ve just had a look at my pearl stud (not
the collar variety) that I mentioned in my previous
par. on the subject (B. 11/10/’23), and find that
matters haven’t progressed in the slightest. The
grains of rice, which the believers in the idea declare
the pearls feed on, are in exactly the same condition
as when I put them in the box 12 months ago. How
OUR “BEST IN THE WORLD.”
DAD: “Why don't they take these Hanky seats out and
give us room to stand up?”
tlie belief originated, and why it is so firmly held by
both whites and blacks, is beyond me. My partner
swears the thing is true, but has had to own that
those in my box show no signs of increase in either
size or number. His suggestion, that my pearls are
not suitably mated, leaves me cold and disbelieving.
My visions of easily-acquired riches have faded, and
my belief in several so-called pearl experts is dead.
Has any other Abo. been lunatic enough to try the
idea ? ' *

THE HOPS OF DEAD MAN’S TANK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Italy has such an excessive wine crop that they
are mixing it with oats and feeding it to the horses.
They believe that the iron tannin and acid in the
wine build strength.”
The hops grew wild ,at Dead Man’s Tank
In Gippsland’s sunny hills ;
And when Ben’s weary bullocks drank,
They felt unusual thrills.
Waving and high, the hop-vines spread
Like corn in Joseph’s dream ;
And Ben, the careless fellow,, fed
The hop-vines to his team.
The bullocks did not sleep that night;
They ate the hops, and drank
The water brown, with froth so white,
That lay in Dead Man’s Tank ;
And when the light of morning broke,
And Ben could see to swear,
He could not lead them to the yoke,
Because they were not there.
He found them where more hop-plants waved
Long tendrils in the breeze,
And cursed them till they all behaved,
In solemn bullockese.
Then, while he fried some weathered chops
And scraped some damper off
The waggon wheel, he gave them hops,
More hops to chew and quaff.
Men tell about it to this day—
How Ben’s old drunken “cows”
Pranced up that rough and rutted way
After their hop carouse.
The iron tannin found in wine
May not occur in beer,
But there was something just as fine
And difficult to steer.
Now when Ben drinks a beer, or fills
A whisky glass, he says:
“That trip across the Gippsland hills
Will do me all my days.
’Twas just a drunken sort of brawl
For twenty mile, the cows!
We pulled through on the alcohol”
So Benjamin allows.

“R.N.W.”: The claim to telepathic powers
made by the N.T. buffalo-hunter in connection with
the Douglas Mawson tragedy, and his statement that
Arnheim blacks' are similarly endowed, may have a
deal of truth in it. The Bulletin a few years
ago drew attention to the fact that some Queensland
natives became aware of the wreck of a schooner out
in the Pacific at the time of the disaster, though it
took weeks for the tidings to reach the mainland in
the ordinary way. How did they get the news? The
paper also recently mentioned the case of a native cap-
tain of a sailing-boat leaving a coastal settlement
in Papua for another quarter. After covering some
distance lie heard the faint sound of a horn across
the water from the direction he had left, and lost
no time in informing a white official on board that
it was necessary to return, as the latter had left an
important instrument (naming it) at the settlement.
On searching the equipment it was found that the
article in question had been left behind. How was
the information imparted to the native’s brain? At
a phosphate island north of New Caledonia, where
Loyalty Islanders were employed, a native crew took
the cutter at intervals to the mainland for mails
and supplies. On one occasion the boys woke me at
2 a.m. to say the cutter was back. Accompanying

them to the jetty I peered out to sea, but could see
nothing but darkness. After waiting about three-
quarters of an hour the boat arrived at the anchorage,
and during that time the boys informed me that a
white man -was on board, also nine Lefou natives;
they gave me several bits of information about the
cargo, all of which were found to be correct. When
C. F. Wells, second in command, and George Jones,
geologist, of the Calvert exploring expedition,
perished near Johanna Springs, in the north of
W.A., in 1896, I was at Naples, and one night
dreamed that these two men were missing from the
party. Subsequently a fellow-traveller to Australia
mentioned that a Times paragraph reported the arri-
val of the expedition at the Fitzroy River, two
members being mi-sing. I told him who they were.
The next copy of the Times to hand mentioned the
names. The impression made upon me by my dream
was such that I noted down the date (22/11/’96).
Months later, when the bodies were found, there was
a last pencilled memo in Jones’s notebook: “On or
about the 18th November, 1896 —we have lost count
of date.” My dream was on the 22nd, some 9000
miles distant. It is said that General Gordon’s death
was known by natives in the streets of Cairo on the
day it happened at Khartoum. Yet it was months
before any news of the tragedy came from away in

MRS. BLOGGS: “Yes, I’ve ’ad a ’ard time. But, believe me, sir, I
never blames the Lord. I know He does Ills best.”
“Pat Bushie” : Let me say “Hooray!” to
“Yarrum’s” cry that the small fish in Lake Mac-
quarie should be protected against those
Goths who churn up the shallows with instruments of
barbed wire, like a cat-o’-nine-tails, when after bait,
thus killing numbers of small fish. This brand of
ruthless destruction is not the only one practised
at the lake. Fishermen use small-meshed nets at
night and bring up hundreds of midgets, which are
smothered as the net is dragged in. These (some
only 21 in. long) would easily escape if the regu-
lation-size net was used. Only recently I watched
a net being brought in, and after the fishermen had
departed looked over the waste. There were hun-
dreds of small bream and whiting left on the fore-
shore to rot.

“Davrich”: Yet another case of injury
from whiplash. A couple of years ago two men
(Harry Blake, now of Rankin’s Springs, and Joe
Adams, now of I-dunno-where) were partners in a
dairy on the Bellinger River. One evening Joe
cracked the stockwhip to wireless the cows for their
evening meal, then
dropped it with a yell
and buried his face
in his hands. Blake
rushed up, but all he
could see was a dark-
blue patch the size of
a threepenny-bit just
under his mate’s left
eye. Closer inspection
with the assistance of
a hurrican e-lamp
showed three blSek
hairs so short that
tweezers had to be
used to get a hold of
them. A tug brought
to light half an inch
of horsehair lash, with
a knot the size of a
pea at the other end.
A peculiar feature of
this case was that the
track of the lash
through the flesh was
semi-circular, from the
bone of the socket to-
wards the eye. In this
instance also there was
a suppurating wound of several mi nths’ duration.
* * * *
“M'arko”: I have never before heard it
suggested that a motor-car is the safest place when
lightning is about (B. 30/10/’24). Nor does the
theory appeal to me. A motor-car as such would be
no sort of refuge; but with the hood up and pre-
suming rain, the lightning would certainly run over
the hood and thence to earth, travelling on the water.
With the hood down, a car occupant would be com-
pletely insulated by the cushions, and, I should say,
occupy an unusually dangerous position.
* * * *
“Centre”: Let me put my spoke into the
discussion re transmission of acquired characteristics
amongst animals. Fox-terriers have had their tails
shortened ever since that particular form of muti-
lation was first considered an improvement to the
animal’s appearance—so years ago. Has any member
of the Council known of a case where a fox-terrier
bitch has thrown a litter of puppies already docked?
If there’s anything in the yarns about calves born
with an ear clip, why is it that young Foxy must
still have his narrative shortened for him? And
isn’t it about time infants began to arrive with vac-
cination marks on their arms?
* * * *
“Moo”: The knowledge of navigation pos-
sessed by the natives
of the coastal districts
of New Guinea is not
nearly so extensive as
that owned by those of
some of the groups
further north; but,
crude as it is, it has
enabled some compara-
tively long voyages to
be made. The popular
method of navigating
is the primitive one of
steering by some star ;
in this way journeys
were made from the
north-eastern coast of
New Guinea to the Bis-
marck Archipelago, a
feat all the more re-
markable when the
clumsy sailing proper-
ties of the native ves-
sels are taken into con-
sideration. Some races
seem to possess the gift
or sense of being able
to navigate Correctly
without anything to
guide them. Many of
the Malay praus which
visited the northern
coast of Australia were
navigated in this man-
ner ; their crews pos-
sessed no charts and
no knowledge of even
rudimentary astronomy.
The same sort of craft
coming across to-day
are equipped with com-
passes, but even with
the aid of these they
are not more skilfully
handled than the earlier ones were.
* * * *•
“Budge”: How’s this for grit? Edmund
Cornwall, working at a small bush mill near
Starvation Creek, in the Warburton (Vic.) district,
got his hand caught in the circular saw, with the
result that half his fingers were cut off. After tying
a bandage round the bleeding stumps, he caught his
horse and rode several miles through thick forest in
search of medical aid at Warburton. Just before
reaching the township he came upon a party of
motorists, who bundled him aboard and rushed him
straight down to the Alfred Hospital. The least
concerned was the bushman, who lost pints of blood
before getting attention.
“Buttenderry” : I can bear out “Gouger's”
statement (B. 11/9/’24) about the possibility of
calves being born with an earmark similar to that
of one of their parents. About 10 years ago Mr.
Warner, a station-owner of Delungra (N.S.W.), sent
several hundred head of hornies to Bonalbo, on the
Upper Clarence, for grass. Among these cattle was
a Durham bull, which, during his sojourn there, sired
a number of calves, most of which were born with
an earmark similar to the sire’s. I forget what
the mark was, but in each ease it was an exact repro-
duction of the old man’s, though, of course, on a
smaller scale. The experiment on guinea-pigs men-
tioned by “Nitric” (B. 16/10/24) is very uncon-
vincing as an argument against the theory of trans-
mission of acquired characteristics. The fact that a
certain number of the offspring lacked hind toes was
extremely significant, and the assumption that they
had been mutilated by their dams may or may not
have been correct; but it certainly would not apply
in the ease of earmarks on cattle.
“Telce”: What about this for an endur-
ance test? It’s from Brunette Downs, in the
Territory. A mare ridden by a coon went to market
and managed to throw him. The mare then took
to the bush, and was found by a party of musterers
90 days afterwards. She had lost the saddle-cloth
and bridle, but the saddle still hung on. It had,
however, slipped under the belly, causing the surcingle
to cut right into the wither. The flies, of course, had
got to work, and the poor brute must have had a
sheol of a time.
* * * *
“Ngutuwera” : “Two Seas” (B. 2/10/’24)
slips when he says that the old-man magpie does
all the home building. I have in my back yard a
tame magpie who has crowned a building success
by laying three eggs, so I’ve a strong suspicion
about its sex.
* * * *
“Boronia”: Before the Queer Accidents
rally ends, let me mention a friend of mine who,
while walking over a treeless portion of the Donnelly
Plains (W.A.), saw a large goanna, and unthinkingly
sooled his dog on to it. The go. becoming hard-
pressed, and deeming it advisable to seek safety in
altitude, made a rush for the man, and in a flash
was perched on top of his head. Instead of throw-
ing himself flat on the ground, when the ugly-
looking brute would have rushed elsewhere, he tried
to pull it off. The more he tugged, the deeper the
go. dug in, with the result that the head and( face
of the man were soon covered with deep gashes.
At length he managed to drag off the animal and
staggered back to his camp, where he, spent a
fortnight in his bunk. Ever since he shudders
when he sees a goanna, and the white streaks on
his head and face bear testimony to the severity
of the tussle.
* * * *
“Sou’-East”: Eight miles up the Glenelg
River live Jim Donovan and his wife. After Jim
shot the Tantanoola “tiger,” back in ’95, he stuffed
it, and for nearly 30 y'ears it has returned him regu-
lar dividends, for no trip to the south-east of S.
Aus. is complete without a visit to Donovan’s cot-
tage. They were wild days in Tantanoola—sheep
■were being slaughtered, and eye-witnesses swore that
the beast, though striped like a tiger, was nearly as
big as a horse. It proved to be a large wolf that
had most likely escaped from a circus.
* * * *
“Herodot” : While a car was travelling at
about 20 m.p.h. on a road in Western N.S.W.
recently, a large dingo jumped out from a patch of
scrub about 15 yards ahead, stood in the glare of
the headlights a second, and then, wheeling around,
commenced to race in front, keeping always right
in the light. An effort was made to run him down,
but each time the dingo increased his pace and
sprang out ahead. For fear of an accident in the
dark the driver did not put on his maximum speed,
and so the strange race was kept up for nearly seven
miles. Just when the dingo was beginning to show
signs of exhaustion, a quick bend in the road was
reached, and as the car negotiated it the dingo momen-
tarily got out of the field of the lights. When the
latter straightened out he was nowhere in sight, evi-
dently having vanished in the second or so that he
was in darkness. This makes it look as though he
was surprised by the light in the first instance, the
powerful glare subsequently having a sort of hypnotic
effect on him.
“Parama”: Mosquitoes have an uncanny
way of discovering when humans are in the vicinity.
We dropped anchor about a couple of miles off the
New Guinea shore—mud and mangroves—at
5 p.m., intending to camp there for the night, and
negotiate the river mouth in the morning. Before
it was dark we were being eaten alive by mosquitoes
that had come out from the shore. No, they hadn’t
been blown out on a land breeze. There wasn’t one;
there wasn’t enough movement in the air to disturb
the smoke from our pipes. They took no notice of
the various things we smeared over our persons to
keep them off, and seemed to enjoy the’ smell of
kersosene. The native crew suffered equally with
ourselves, though ashore they don’t seem to be
troubled to any extent.
* * * *
“Homfrey Beale” : At The Peak, a little
N.S.W. township west o’ Barmedman, lives a family
of settlers named Foy. The other day an unusually
violent storm was in progress, and the mother and
daughter, being alone in the house, foregathered in
the sitting-room. Suddenly both ladies felt a shock
and severe pain in both feet. Recovering from their
semi-stunned condition, and their feet still smarting
badly, they removed their footwear to find all four
feet blistered and scorched. Then they noticed the
telephone on the wall
twisted as badly as a
Futurist straight line.
After that it didn't
need a Sherlock Holmes
to guess what had hap-
pened, and both ladies
now swear ’ mean
solemnly allege) that
they’ll never again for-
get to disconnect the
’phone during a storm.
AFTER THE FALL.
“Hue ye brocken the flask, mon?”
“Ah dinna ken. Ah feel something wat
Francklin doon ma troosirs.”
“Hech! Ah hope it's bluid.”
“8.8. C.” : The cochineal insect, introduced
to Queensland to exterminate prickly-pear, is giving
its attention to another great pest, nut-grass. On
J. H. S. Barnes’s property at Canning Downs the
red insects took possession of a patch, made short
work of the blades, and reduced the nuts to a
spongy mass incapable of reproduction. If the atten-
tion of the insect can be turned to sida retusa and
lantana, and be made to stop there, it will prove a
great friend to Australia. Its worst enemy in
Queensland is the ant.
ON THIS ROAD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
On this road disused for years,
Reddened now by sunset’s glow,
East or west, up hill or down,
Dust enshrouded, burnt and brown,
Rode the drovers long ago.
Here they paused at night to camp,
Here they slept and dreamt their dreams —
Well content or ill content—■
While their fires about them sent
Wreathing smoke and circling gleams.
On this road by men unsought,
Washed by rain and worn by wind,
Rugged made by rock and root,
Groove of wheel or print of foot
Seek and you shall never find.
But you will a something gain—
Something lovely that belongs,
Still unsilenced, to this scene;
Something sounding from the green
Leafage of its kurrajongs.
Like the men who rode this road,
Rode its leagues in frost and heat—
Leagues that fall and leagues that climb—
You will hear the bellbird’s chime
Rising, falling, clear and sweet.
Though the horseman’s' tracks have gone,
Worn and washed by many rains,
Though the fires they built of old
Ashes are, wind-blown and cold,
Still the bellbird’s song remains.
On this road disused for years,
Reddened now by sunset’s glow,
Shadow-shapes that know not rest,
Eastward moving, moving west,
Horse and horsemen come and go.

Thursday night’s Government House Ball
had its Cup Week cheeriness somewhat
dulled by rain. There would have been, in
any case, no attempt to revive pre-war splen-
dor; the dazzle of Windsor and consular
uniforms was missing from the dais end,
and the official “square” was banned. Mili-
tary trappings sprinkled the gathering very
sparsely, and where they appeared showed all
too cruelly the flight of time by refusing to
meet around the increased girth of their
owners. Instead of the cold electric glare
showing up every grain of powder and face
wrinkle, the dancers were bathed in a golden
glow, due to the kindly forethought of Lady
Forster. Green bamboos flanked the ball-
room dais, and mixed vegetation walled in
the musicians’ gallery. Iler “Ex., trailing dra-
peries blue as her eyes, circled the ball-
floor chatting to those she knew. Lady de
Chair’s fine figure was swathed in shining
bronze, brocaded in pale colorings. Lady
Stradbroke. who came in late, trailed blue
and silver brocade with a red feather fan to
match the huge rubies centring the diamonds
surrounding her head and neck. With her
was daughter Helena, in a frosted silver
frock. shoulder-strapped with diamente.
Dame Nellie looked in her golden draperies
as if she had stepped off the summit of an
Ormulu timepiece.
Quite half the younger women glittered
like mermaids or a school of goldfish, while
most of the matrons had crowned their heads
with diamonds, or, if they didn’t have dia-
monds, with near-diamonds, or (more
frankly) with paste. The star creation—of
crepe that ran on from rose-pink to crim-
son—was worn by handsome Mrs. Leonard
Lansell, of the Golden City. One damsel
whose dress just hit her silk-shod knees, under
a transparent yellow overall which halted
at her calves, appeared to have borrowed her
little sister’s frock. Nearly every skirt
worth looking at flirted with the owner’s
ankles; and nearly every youthful head car-
ried a bun, attached, if necessary, to shingled
locks; it is wonderful what a woman can
do at Fashion’s demand !
Friday's stormburst washed the Govern-
ment House lawn-party into the reception
parlors for a crowded hour. Fortunately a
lot of people had funked the downpour, which
saved Melbourne from another Black Hole
horror; and a tramway stoppage, blockading
the St. Ivilda-road, made everybody late.
Some of the invited only unloaded from their
cars in time to be “God Saved” back to them.
The Forsters received in the ballroom, where
an orchestra was sometimes heard above the
chatter. At the other end the crowd talked
down a rival set of players. Lady Forster's
nut-brown brocade had a tasselled girdle
under a wide-brimmed hat; and Lady de
Chair's brown-feathered hat shaded a frock
to match, pinafored with porcelain beads.
Hats, in fact, were all that could be seen
above the surging mob. The whole of the
local peerage had emptied itself into the vice-
regal home, together with all the civic hus-
bands and wives. The Church brigade was
headed by Archbishop Lees and his wife;
and not a brass-cap or cocked-hat in the city
had failed to bring its womanfolk along.
The spectacular ritual of the investiture
proceedings in the Government House
drawing-room took one back to pre-war
days. Nearly 40 embarrassed but well-
drilled honor winners, mostly wearing khaki,
passed Captain Pitt Rivers, who was the
taking-off post, and, bumping their fore-
heads on the oilcloth the requisite number
of times, advanced to the music of squeak-
ing boot-soles on his Ex., who distributed
the forfeits. Surgeon Syme was the only
flat-sworded hero. Flight-commander Goble
took a fresh breast-ribbon, and Colonel Hind-
haugh added another to his long line of
medals. Governors Stradbroke, De Chair
and Tom Bridges gave vice-regal weight to
the impromptu dais by the side bow win-
dows facing the rows of seated spectators.
With the Lord Forsters were her Ex., in
almond-green velvet, and Lady de Chair in
black silk splashed with blue. Little Julian
and Michael Pitt Rivers drank in the spec-
tacle with brimming eyes. Tea in. the hall
epilogued the ceremony. Dame Nellie Melba,
who is sheltering under the vice-regal roof,
surveyed the goings-on with Miss Carleton
and Sybil Campbell.
The newspapers had their own grievance
against the Y.R.C. this year: to their horror
and surprise the presswomen who are re-
sponsible for “writing up” the dresses were
unable to get into the members’ stand where
they could see them; and the anger or
society dames at being cooped in an enclosure
where they could not preen their hiie
feathers before the crowd rose to boiling-
point when they found the feathers unre-
ported. The demands of some of the papers,
which made claim for tickets for an army
of pressmen, photographers, laddermen
copyboys and sundries, undoubtedly inclined
the' V.R.C. committee to restrict the issue
of press tickets ; but the restriction was car-
ried out in a very unwise fashion.
Admiral Hall Thompson’s wife is making a
hobby of tea-drinkings: she hostessed another
in the best parlor of the Alexandra
Club last week, with Lady de Chair as star
guest. The room blossomed with flowers in
season, and a ukulele orchestra pleasantly
underlaid the conversational breakers with
haunting Hawaiian melodies. Mrs. Hall
Thompson, in white marocain and black lace,
how-d’ye-doed at the doorway, while pretty
daughter Valerie, in rust-red voile and
lace, smiled from under a little black
hat. The N.S.W. Governor’s lady, in
black georgette with shimmering blue beads,
brought with her Sybil Campbell, who lately
arrived from the heather on a visit to the
G.-G. Forsters. Before any civil introduc-
tions were made the naval wives were pre-
sented to Lady de Chair. Nellie Melba
looked in, sporting raven upliolsterings.
The Trussell Dyers’ ewe-lamb, Mardie, had
the Malvern Masonic Hall last week for a
night’s jazz and jollity. With Chinese panel-
lings and splashes of blossom papering the
four walls, and ribbon entanglements hiding
the ceiling, the official building looked as if
it had forgotten itself in an unguarded
moment. Mardie’s petal-pink georgette from
the French capital had a back cape pulled
over with silver lace, and her mother stood
up in black marocain slashed with green and
gold. The feet of many of the elders twinkled
gayly in a set of after-supper lancers, but
found the pace of the late-Victorian Kitchen
Lancers too furious a contrast to the jazz
saunter which has tempted even our grand-
parents to take the dance-floor again. Young
things who began by sniffing at the “square”
as stuffy found the exhilarating friendliness
of (lie new-old dance so thrilling that they
loudly asked for more. Amongst the elders
there were Mrs. James Ang*s, convoying a
pretty niece, Addie Markwell; Mrs. Mow-
bray-Turnbull, a Women's League light, just
back after 12 months of N.S.W. station life;
and Teddy Dyson, taking a languid interest
in life after his recent illness.
Dark-blue mess-jackets and a few of the
old scarlet punctuated the khaki at the
Maison de Luxe, Elwood, the other day, when
Colonel E. W. Tulloch and officers of the
22nd battalion had their regimental hop.
Colonels Lorenzo and Ralph and Major
Blake, of the Staff Corps, brought their
ladies, and the. regiment’s red and purple pro-
vided the decorative color scheme.
Dorothy Ashley, here depicted by Broo-
thorn, is the clever Kew girl who is making
a name for
herself as a
painter of
period pictures.
For her sub-
jects she goes
to the early
days of Good
Queen V i c.,
and h e r
charming
water-colors on
this theme in
the Victorian
Artists’ Show
have raised a
buzz of favor-
able comment.
The bright
little artist,
who got her
training as a
National Gal-
lery student,
dabbled in a
variety of subjects before settling down
seriously as a period specialist. A success-
ful exhibition of her Early Victorian maidens
brought her to her decision.
Laura Nyulasy and her sister, Mrs.
Cowper, set the week twirling with an after-
noon party in Menzies’ big reception parlor.
Hundreds of rose bushes had been despoiled,
and everyone had got out next year’s fashions
for the occasion. Large flowers nodded above
a black border in Mrs. Cowper’s white silk,
and water-lilies floated on the upper reaches
of her spreading hatbrim. Sister Laura’s
face was framed in a wimple veil depend-
ing from a small brown hat, topping pink
crepe. Small shrines sunk in the velvet pile
smoked with the incense of fresh tea. Walter
Kirby and Dorothy Murdoch sang bewitcli-
ingly “Softly Awakes My Heart,” and Natalie
Dawson supplied the piano backings.
A broken arm was the reason why the
well-groomed figure of genial Edmund Jowett
was not seen at the social functions of Race
Week. Time was when he enjoyed the repu-
tation of being the best-turned-out man in
Oollins-street. Then Stanley Melbourne
Bruce tore half the laurel circle from him.
On Saturday night Dr. and Mrs. E. V.
Richardson were started on their way to
Adelaide by Dr. Leon Jona and his wife with
a gay at-home at No. 9 Darling-street. The
host and hostess, with their star guests, com-
bined to welcome the invited. The Jona
lady smiled above a frock of wine-colored
silk inset with palest green, and Mrs. Richard-
son trailed mauve satin hung with fine old
lace. Both ladies held presentation posies,
and the room was massed with champion
blooms. The evening whirled away with a
little good music, intervals of jazz, lots of
talk and a special brand of supper. Mrs.
Richardson sang her good-byes, in a full-
toned soprano, which might have won her
fame if she had not side-tracked a musical
career to make hi. V. Richardson happy.
Many leading medicoes and their wives,
headed by surgeon George Syme and his lady,
were there; and ex-Mayoress Hennessy
brought a daughter, just back from the other
side of the Equator, in a thrilling Paris frock
of pink and ostrich plumes.
Like his late brother, Penleigh, Meyrick
Boyd, whom you see here, was born with a
paint-brush in his hands —both his parents are

The mother
was an a’Beck-
ett. While Pen.
stuck to his
brns h, the
younger bro-
ther exchanged
his for a pot-
ter’s whee 1,
and made
rather more
than a do of
that' ancient
craft. T h e
“B oy d” pot-
te r y having
earned a State-
wide renown,
the potter has
turned his
supple fingers
to the fashion-
ing of clay heads. He can catch a likeness
and has a feeling for form, so he should go
far in the new direction.
Ethel Turner’s new novel, “Nicola Silver,”
is the story of a country girl tied down to
a struggling farm, knowing nothing of the
world beyond the little village near by, but
determined to see the city; of a wonderful
two weeks there: of her return home to
drudgery, and finally a delightful touch of
love. It is to be one of the features in
The Bulletin's new woman’s weekly (the
Woman’s Mirror), which will be published
on November 25. The Mirror, though it
will be well illustrated and attractive in ap-
pearance, is to cost only threepence a w r eek:
and that will include a free paper pattern,
designed for Australian women and girls.
On Saturday night, at the Royal, a friendly
crowd took John O’Hara by o.ne hand and
“Ivempy” by the other, and threw a smiling
nod of appreciation towards Maggie Moore.
The circle and front stalls were thickly
peopled with swallow-tails and chiffons, and
burst out in floral bombardment of the ladies
in the cast at the final curtain. Ailsa
Graham and Eileen Sparkes got whispered
cheers for their frocks, and Maggie Moore
earned sympathy for hers. Eileen aired a
ravishing rosy silk front panelled with ivory,
but her side locks crowded her good looks
out of sight.
Mrs. George Landale and her sister, Mrs.
Bob Knox, combined to launch a Carnival
Week Ball in the Knoxes’ Toorak parlors.
The Landales’ Macedon flowerbeds had been
pillaged to provide the decorations. The star
guest was S. Australia’s Governor Bridges.
Dame Nellie Melba warmed white chiffon
with a black-and-gold brocaded wrap ; Mrs.
Lansdale wore lacquer-red satin brocaded
with gold and headings and dadoed with grey
fur; and Mrs. Knox panelled her white crepe
with ermine.
The directors of the Capitol Theatre, which
now dominates the Block on the Swanston-
street side, broadcasted invitations for an
official unveiling on Friday night. The first
screening of “The Ten Commandments” was
its maiden effort, and in it the pomp and
luxury of modern America vied with that
of ancient Egypt, and made the outer subur-
banites miss their last trains. Mayor Brun-
ton, launching the thing, and Willie Watt,
floating it on his oratory, invested the occa-
sion with an almost national importance.
The new theatre impresses by its size. The
white ceilings suggest massed icebergs de-
signed by a giant with a taste for cubism.
That the Scots of Melbourne are not too
Scotch where their sympathies are aroused
has been shown by a re-sliuffle which will
lead to the establishment of several new in-
stitutions, including a babies’ home and
maternity hospital for unmarried mothers,
a girls’ hostel and a hospital. There is a
Peace Thanksgiving Fund, established five
years ago, which now has £BO,OOO to help
these causes. This Midas is giving £15,000 to-
wards the purchase of the old East Mel-
bourne Scotch College buildings for the new
purposes; and of the £lO,OOO which the com-
mitteo in charge will have to find to clinch
the deal, £(>000 is already in hand. Stu-
dents of Scotch College are still living at
the East Melbourne quarters, but the college
is about to transplant them all to its new
buildings at Hawthorn.
The ancient Byron Moore, now 81, and
with a record of 44 years as secretary of
the V.R.C., is, besides, a broker; but his
enthusiasms run to nature study, rose-grow-
ing, music—church music for preference —
and writing children’s stories for charitable
objects. One little book, “Cruel Imp.”
brought over £250 to the Children’s Hospital.
“Royal” tennis-players made signs indicating
cerebral excitement last week when Charlie
Butler, the Speck’s amateur champion, car-
ried off another gold racquet and later beat
W. Stone, the Melbourne champion. The
G.-G. and Lord Stradbroke were keen follow-
ers of the play, and warmly congratulated
Butler. By the way, the late T. Travers,
the champion’s grandfather, founded the first
Royal tennis court in Australasia; it still
stands in Davey-street, Hobart.
The John Winter Irvings, who said “Bless
y’, m’ children,” to daughter Margaret and
Bruce Meade a few months back, breathed
the same words last week over the younger
of their lily-fair daughters, Joan, who has
agreed to make Geoff Heath happy. Geoff,
who is an old Melbourne Grammar boy, is
one of the brightest members of Prince’s
famous amateur band, and a sprig of the
tennis-playing family.
During the past 12 months no less than
7013 trains were met, over 3000 travellers
helped, and 156 children whose ages ranged
from 3 to 14 years rescued by the
Travellers’ Aid Society, which has just
celebrated its eighth birthday. Miss Irene
Vanburgli has become keenly interested in
the work, and has promised to give a matinee
to help the funds.
Chapel-street pram-pushers, who hold up
the traffic daily by foregathering in massed
formation for friendly converse, may be
horrified to hear of a recent English decision
concerning- the traffic rights of baby’s jugger-
naut. These rights, declared the court at
Brighton, were confined solely to the road-
way ; and it fined four women, two nurses
and a brace of visitors ss. apiece for obstruct-
ing the footpaths by wheeling two prams
abreast.
Mrs. R. S. Smythe, relict of the great con-
cert manager of 40 years ago, celebrated
her 82nd birthday this month at her home
at Deepdene. She married the “much tra-
velled” on an Eastern tour; she was then
Amelia Bailey, a pupil of Herr Elsasser,
and had made many appearances on concert
platforms in Melbourne.
Adelaide’s week:—
The Cup has left us socially high and dry, and
our energies have been mostly devoted to the stock-
taking of charitable enterprises. Foremost among
them is the Children’s Hospital appeal for £20,000
for a new outpatients’ department. The objective
here has been reached; and for this the Govern-
ment, which said “Yes” to a request for a pound-
for-pound subsidy, and Mrs. Glover share the credit.
The Deaf and Dumb Mission held its annual meeting
at the Angas Home for Aged and Infirnj Deaf and
Dumb at Parafield, and reported the amazing pheno-
menon of a surplus of £ 13,000-odd.
Exit our largest hotel, the Grand Central, to make
way for Foy and Gibson’s groceries. As pub accom
modation in this village was already inadequate, in-
tending visitors are hereby advised to bring a length
of wire-fence and a swaggie’s blanket with them.
The Governor's decision to spend the summer at
Victor Harbor has set the House asking about the
cost and usefulness of Marble Hill, the vice-regal
week-end resort in our highlands. It seems that Mary
Jane is to blame again. She merely turns up her
nose at the beauties of the hills, which explains why
the vice-regal shack hasn’t been used so much of late.
The Francis H. Snows’ garden at Mount Lofty
has been twice chock-a-block with envious people
this week —once for a private garden-party and then
in the cause of the Halifax-street Free Kindergarten.
Snows’ is one of the show-places of the Mount, with
rare foreign blooms set in a mingled wilderness of
Australian and English shrubs.
It has been decided that the Mayor of this village
is not a “Right Honorable,” and ex-Mayor Cohen pro-
tests every time the illegal form is used. A breezy
discussion in the Council on the subject brought
from Alderman Edwards the not untimely sugges-
tion that the whole question be relegated to the
Halifax-street destructor.
Rose-colored antirrhinums and masses of old-
fashioned honeysuckle, with tiny bunches of Cecil
Brunner roses for each guest, were heaped in St.
Michael’s Church at Mitcham for the marriage of
Molly, the third of the Tom Barr-Smith daughters, to
Richard Legoe. Only relatives and intimate friends
were there. The bride’s frock of gold- and silver-
shot brocade was topped by a wide-brimmed hat.
Afterwards there was tea at Birksgate, and then a
blowing of pink-rose petals and golden confetti over
the motor that took them to Melbourne.
Adelaide’s new railway station has notv got itself
on paper. From among 19 competitors who sent
in designs, three were approved last May, paid £250
each, and asked to amend their plans on suggestions
from Railways Commissioner Webb and Architect-in-
Chief Simpson. These two have how finally decided
in favor of the Garlick and Jackman plan. The
station is to remain a dead (or, as the American
Webb calls it, a “stub”) end, as at present, and
will cost about £250,000.

This Week’s Toilet Hints
A Rare Collection of Beauty Hints from Near and Far
Getting Rid of Feminine Moustaches.
“Practical Suggestions.”
-Lo w oiTieii who are annoyed by disfigur-
es downy hair growths a method of eradi-
cating the same will come as a piece of good
news. For this purpose pure powdered
i'heminol may be used. Almost any chemist
should be able to supply a package of this
orug. The recommended treatment is de-
signed not only to remove the disfiguring
growth instantly, leaving no trace, but also
to actually kill the hair roots without irri-
tating the skin.
How to Have Thick and Pretty Hair.
“Home Talents.”
Soaps and artificial shampoos ruin many
beautiful heads of hair. The ideal shampoo
is a teaspoonful of good stallax dissolved in
a cup of hot water, which lias a natural
affinity for the hair and makes the most
delightful shampoo imaginable. It leaves
the hair brilliant, soft and wavy, cleanses
the scalp completely and greatly stimulates
the hair growth. The only drawback is that
stallax seems rather expensive. It comes to
the chemist only in sealed original packages,
which retail at 4/-. However, as this is
sufficient for about twenty-five shampoos, it
is really much cheaper than individual sham-
poo powders.
Blackheads, Oily Pores, etc.
A Unique New Method Instantly
Removes and Corrects Them.
The new sparkling face-bath treatment
rids the skin of blackheads, oiliness and en-
larged pores almost instantly. It is per-
fectly harmless, pleasant and immediately
effective. All you have to do is to drop a
stymol tablet in a glass of hot water, and
after the resulting effervescence has sub-
sided dab the affected portions of the face
freely with the liquid. When you dry the
face you will find that the blackheads come
right off on the towel, the large pores con-
tract and efface themselves, and the greasi-
ness is all gone, leaving the skin smooth,
soft and cool. This treatment should be
repeated a few times at intervals of several
days in order to make sure that the result
vshall be permanent. Stymol tablets are
obtainable from most good chemists.
Grey Hair Unnecessary.
A Simple, Old-fashioned, Home-made
Jjotion That Will Restore the Color of
Youth.
One need not resort to the very question-
able expedient of hair dye in order not to
have grey hair. The grey hair can easily
be changed back to a natural color in a few
days' time merely by the application of a
simple, old-fashioned and perfectly harmless
home-made lotion. Procure from your
chemist two ounces of tammalite concentrate
and mix it with three ounces of bay rum.
Apply this to the hair a few times with a
small sponge, and you will soon have the
pleasure of seeing your grey hair gradually
darkening to the desired shade. The lotion
is pleasant, not sticky or greasy, and does
not injure the hair in any way.
All Pretty Girls Use Barri-Agar Face Powder. From Chemists, 4/- box.

A WOMAN'S
LETTERS
SAY-
Kayser
SILK
STOCKINGS
It is six years since the soldier made
peace possible for us. He did it at the
cost of life and limb, of eyesight, of nerves.
Civilisation accepted the sacrifice with extra-
vagant expressions of gratitude: w r e would
never forget; he and his would be our charge
for all time. On Friday, the sixth anniver-
sary of Armistice Day, the city echoed with
the rattle of the collection-box for our soldier
sick and (some of them) close-to-starving.
The collection-box for soldiers six years after
the war is our own indictment of ourselves.
At noon Prime Minister Bruce cut a red-
v.hite-and-blue ribbon and loosed a flock of
pigeons in Martin-place. The band played
a bar or two of the National Anthem, and
officially the Day had started. Actually it
had started in the early hours of the morn-
ing, when symnathetic women took their
collection-boxes and artificial poppies to the
Quay, to the railway stations, to busy street
corners and caught the first-comers to the city.
Prosperous and shabby men bought a bloom
arid pinned it to their lapels; middle-aged
women, bone-thin or comfortably a-spread,
fastened the symbol in their dress. Poppy
dreams! Dreams of the lad who went away
in the cold dawning long ago never to re-
turn! For there was no coming back for
that boy who went through the gates at
Woolloomooloo. Even if the flesh returned
the youth was slain.
Sydney’s Armistice observance on Tuesday
was impressive. The two minutes’ silence
seemed to radiate from the group on the dais
in Alartin-place over the whole city. Then
from an 11-storey building in course of
erection opposite the Post Office came the
sounds of an Australian workman well and
truly laying a brick. The strokes of his
trowel rang crisply across the hush. It was
a good symbol. It stood for reconstruction,
and if the Armistice meant anything it
meant that.
The Forum, the newest group of women
who insist upon the sex's representation in
Parliament, met in the vestibule of the Town
Hall last week to pledge itself, foot, horse
and field-bakery, to support a woman candi-
date in every electorate. It doesn’t matter
what party she belongs to : her sex is every-
thing, her politics nothing. The Forum’s
president, Miss Jessie Macdonald (she’s one
of the principals of the Morven Garden
School), in spotless wdiite from crown to heel,
made a commonsense little speech asking
woman to stick to woman. A 7 ictorian Mrs.
Glencross had a word to .say about equal re-
presentation in Parliament; Mrs. Jamieson
Williams, the Independent candidate for
North-Sydney, spoke on the decay of party
politics; and Mrs. Soery, Mrs. Bennett and
Mrs. Alelville —the last not a bit disturbed
at the prospect of having to fight the Eastern
Suburbs Labor pre-selection all over again—
were others who threw color and fire into
the argument.
Every woman, and a good few men, are
sorry that Dr. Constance D’Arcy wasn’t
re-elected to the University Senate. There
really should have been one woman among
the elected candidates, and nobody could be
better fitted for the high place than she.
AVe are to wear the backless evening frock
again. But while the back is cut into a V
that extends to almost the waist-line, the
neckline in front is high from shoulder to
shoulder. AVith these frocks you wear your
million-pound string of pearls so twisted
about your throat as to fall down over the
back, the ultimate jewel dangling against
the 12th knob of your spine. The lowest V’s
ever seen in Sydney were worn by that
attractive young woman Muriel AA 7 indow,
who toured with Harry Lauder. One night
an old boy, after taking an eyeful of the
dijinpled young shoulder-blades, shook his
head disapprovingly. “That’s a AATndow,”
he said, “that should be without even a sash!”
Most of Sydney society with a feather to
fly with is at the Cup. Even fetes have suf-
fered a blight; last week-end there was only
one of any size—that was at the Garden
School—while on the Saturday before the
Cup exodus there were seven of the garden-
fair variety alone within the city radius. By
these signs shall ye know that the end of
the year is at hand, and the buying of
Christmas presents is upon you.
The Victoria Leaguers are farcwelling the
Chief Justice Cullen couple over a mid-day
chop at the Ambassadors to-day (Thursday).
Lady de Chair, who is president of the
League, will take her place at the top table.
It is true that the Cullens don t leave tor
Europe till the New Year, but the Leaguers
believe in getting their good-byes over in a
seemly manner and with no vulgar rush.
The Sydney Uni. Union will have a nice
bill at the stationers’ after last week s flare-
up: 8000 cards were sent out bidding grads,
and under-grads., together with Church,
State, Military and Naval dignitaries, back to
the old home again. The rally was to cele-
brate the jubilee year of the Union, and to
show off the new Union building, the refectory
of which is a matter for pride in professional
circles. Major Booth and liis lady did the
honors, and notable figures in the crush were
the Chief Justice Cullens, the Prof. Mac-
Cnllum couple, and Judge Backhouse and his
wife.
The Shakspearc Society lured crowds of
Allan AA 7 ilkie's admirers into the Wentworth
one fine afternoon last week to give them a
chance to tell the Bard’s disciple how much
they liked the bur-r in his Macbeth. Allan
and liis ethereal-looking lady sat at a table
inhaling the incense of a large bowl of New
Orleans roses, arid listening with one ear to
the jazz band, while the other was turned to
the voice of the flatterer. Pianist dc Bour-
guignon proved himself the most enthusiastic
dancer of the group, and Jean Atlioll, Jessica
Dale and Kiore King—the young things
among AVilkie’s players-—had no end of a
time. The society's president and Mrs. Jack-
son did the honors.
After living a bachelor life for 43 years
The Bulletin is about to acquire a mate.
On November 25 it will introduce its new
lady-friend to the public. will be a
woman’s weekly, of the class that Australian
women have long wanted. The Mirror —
that is her name—will deal with everything
of interest to the sex —needlework, fashions,
household matters, health, babies, sport and
theatres; and there will be serials and short
stories by the wonderful circle of authors
tliat The Bulletin has got together. There
will be with every issue a free paper pattern ;
and the whole number (pattern included)
will cost only threepence.
Sydney is taking to AYilliam Heughan of
the clean-cut Highland profile, the kilts and
the good bass voice. His season is alternat-
ing between the Gonservatorium and the
Town Hall —three concerts at one end of the
town, two at tlie other. It seems certain
that AA 7 illiam is a good son o’ the kirk: how
else would he think of announcing his num-
bers as though they were psalms? “Number
109,” he intones, and then the audience
rustles through its composite programme till
its eye lights on the number which carries
the name of the song, aria or violin solo
alongside. By his method it is necessary
to buy only one programme throughout the
season. AYell, nae doot, Scot kens Scot.
J. C. AVilliamson’s manager AVestmacott
has promised to arrange a programme of
star turns for the supper-dance in aid of the
Sacred Heart Hospice at the AVentworth
on the 18th.
New heads in old halls is the wary cry of
Mrs. Muscio, the lady in the picture. She’s
president of
the Crosby
Hall Endow-
me n t Fund,
and as she is
one of the
chiefs in the
Women Under-
grads’ Associa-
tion her influ-
ence in behalf
of this home
away from
home for Do-
minion s t 11-
dents is a
strong one.
Th e other
week she or-
ganised one of
the most suc-
cessful ama-
teur produc-
tions the Con.
has ever known
in aid of her favored objective. She is an
impressive speaker (her enunciation is just
about perfect), and she is. one of the ruling
spirits in the National Council of AA 7 omen.
Her clever husband is Professor Muscio, of
Sydney Uni., and before her marriage the
lady herself was one of the Misses Fry of
Manly—an unusually brilliant sisterhood.
May Moore made the picture.
“The Other AA 7 ise Man” was duly staged at
the Star of the East amphitheatre at Bal-
moral on Saturday afternoon. There wasn’t
a great attendance, probably owing to the
grumpy look of the sky, and in the broad
light of day those who sat on the cold, cold
stone seats perceived that “The Other AA’ise
Man” had as many holes in it as a last-
season’s stocking. In construction it is weak,
and the speeches arc too long for their dra-
matic or poetic quality. The bright spots
were the multi-colored robes of the players
the action centres in Babylon and Jeru-
salem in the time of Christ. The play was
pi’oaaced by Ethel Lorimer.
China, the America of architects, Spain,
Sicily, eld Calabria, the land of the Sybar-
ites—now nothing but the dead-end of a
little railway! Into all these places Hardy
AA T ilson wandered during his three years
away from Australia, and his notes fill a
mountain of pocket-books and the cuffs of six
shirts. In China the architect-artist lost
himself among authors present and past. He
was charmed to discover one old gentleman
who had lived, sung and philosophised in a
northern garden 400 years or so 8.C., and
in his spare moments had written as charm-
ing a book of cookery as a man might hope
to find. In California he discovered the inner
meaning of “beauty holds us with a single
hair.” AVlien he was in Monterey the, people
of that town and its neighbors, Del Monte
and Sale, were working up a pageant of the
old-tipie Mission that was the first settle-
ment of the State. Every citizen seemed
to be taking part, and to create atmosphere
the males were letting their side-wliiskers
grow in the fashion of the period. In a few
weeks it seemed as though a miracle of grace
had happened; the hard, blatant, close-
shaven male face was turned by these adorn-
ments into a type that fairly lilted the
Spanish Main, the Armada, grandees and
courtliness. Hardy AVilson adds reflectively
that he hadn’t seen a pigtail or a ringleted
schoolgirl in the States or Europe, and when
the species was reintroduced to his vision in
Sydney he wondered for a moment what was
wrong wfith the line of the child’s head. The
artist’s book on “Old Colonial Architecture”
will soon reach Australia. The drawings in
it are the best from his exhibition in the
ATctoria and Albert Museum in London.
May Moore captured this likeness of John
Gould the other day. John, who is now in
the Lands Department, is to be either an
Irving or a Charles Russell. Law is his
study and to
be a barrister
his aim, but
he has a
genius for act-
ing. This was
first displayed
in his persona-
tion of Sir
Peter in
“School for
Scandal” when
he saved an
ambitious
S.U.D.S. pro-
duction from
disaster. Since
then he has
played many
parts, his
Paddy in the
“Hairy Ape”
getting every
ounce of
poetry out of
the part that author Eugene O’Neill had
dreamed into it. The other week he was
the Everyman of that miracle play produced
at the Con. in aid of the Crosby Hall Endow-
ment Fund. John comes from Launceston,
was educated at the Christian Brothers’
School, AVaverley, and is a B.A. of Sydney
Uni.
The Union refectory at the Uni. threatens
to ring like the anvil of Thor next AA 7ednes-
day night when the Engineers are holding
revelry to help pay the last instalment on
the Engineering bell in the Carillon.
Kate Rooney will be back in Sydney next
month. Her engagement as contralto at
the Scarsdale R.C. Church ties her to New
York, as a rule ; but she is kept busy enough
there with drawing-room concerts and ora-
torio engagements. Among her proud pos-
sessions are a pair of Italian chairs from
Caruso’s collection —sixteenth-century arm-
chairs, finely carved with the coat-of-arms of
the Vitelli di Citta Gastello family. Kate’s
married name is Kirkham, and her husband
is an art connoisseur.
Out of Duncan Macdougall’s Playbox on
November 18 peeps “Morality,” a comedy by
Thoma, translated bv Recht. The fun of
this is guaranteed to make even the care-
taker of St. James’s laugh aloud.
Jean Drummond, who has been pouring
her intensity into a song cycle at the English
seaside places, has now been booked for the
Coliseum circuit for 12 months. Sister Lute
has a mountain of song translations on hand,
and one discerning manager wants a lecture
tour in the States—with her stories of the
operas as the foundation. Incidentally,
Allan Prior a, with whom Jean sang grand
opera duets at the Haymarket, is now in
America, making records and filling New
York engagements.
The widow of lawyer AY. F. Brennan (he
died in,July last), and one of Sydney’s pretty
women, slipped into the shadows at AA 7ent-
worth Falls on a recent wintry Sunday. A
generation ago there was hardly a charity
that failed to interest her, hut St. Vincent’s
Hospital and the Babies’ Home at Ashfield
were her two hobbies. Sorrow shadowed
her latter years. Handsome daughter Adele
died in England of pneumonic ’flu when she
was doing Y.A.D. work in Leicester military
hospital; and big son Billy was killed at
Gaza, in Palestine. One daughter and two
sons are left.
Big bowls of pink carnations decked the
farewell to Yvonne Edgley in the Australia
drawing-room, while the rain splashed tin
kerb outside, and made it a coat-and-golosh
afternoon. The graceful Neutral Bay girl
leaves for London by an out-going Orient
liner, and an anxious young man will be
scanning the shipping news till she arrives.
A wedding follows, after which Yvonne will be
Mrs. Cyril Longsdon. Mrs. Edgley hostessed
the party, and Margaret Windeyer made a
gallant little speech on matrimony. Norman
Court, Wilts, will be the bride-elect’s home.
The youngest and only unmarried of the
pretty Wheeler girls, of Manly, has had an
engagement-ring slipped on to her finger. The
classical looking beauty is English on father's
side, Danish on mother's, and her name is
Inga Helen. The young man is Alan Doug-
las Syme, of Gillinbah station, Narrandera,
and lie's a grandson of the late David Syme,
of the Age.
Leila Waddell and Nellie Leach, who are
off with their trio to Brisbane, gave a party
last week, between turns, in the lounge of the
Haymarket. The two clever girls, with com-
poser Lawrence (lie's the man who gave
“My Little Wooden Hut” to the world),
have been putting on a bright act at the
Haymarket—Nellie singing, Leila at the
fiddle, and Lawrence making the piano earn
its living. Their tea-drinking was a great
success ; it lured even “Hop” out of his seclu-
sion. Trixie Tange brought her nearly-as-
young-as-herself mother, and of the forty
gathered together nobody left till the last
possible minute.
Mrs. Fred Aronson, whose mastery over the
stewpan and the casserole shows a combina-
tion of power and imagination, has composed
a new Mary Elizabeth Cook Book. Creating
dishes has been the underlying motif of Mrs.
Aronson’s existence for the past two de-
cades ; in the interludes she has swung an
active journalistic pen, and interested herself
in the question of bringing domestic help to
every home.
Besides the out-patient hospital run by
women doctors in Surry Hills there is one
in Sydney with a purely female resident
staff (gardeners and engineers excluded)
St Joseph’s, at Auburn. The Sisters of
Charity are the owners and the executive,
and the resident medicoes are Dr. Katharine
Hyndes and Dr. Lucy McMahon. There
are 70 beds, and the patients are drawn
largely from the Clyde Engineering Works
and Auburn railway yards.
Brisbane’s miscellany:—
This susceptible city has been making its hands
sore clapping the Melba-Williamson grand-opera
singers at His Majesty’s, where Phyllis Archibald’s
voice won by a head from Nino Picealuga’s smile
in the Popularity Stakes. His Ex. joined in on
t..c opening night with Mrs. George Nathan, her
daughter and the Canning Downs Barneses. Others
in the big audience were the Bishop Lefanus, the
Readings, the A. D. Walshes, Mrs. Gilbert Wilson
and Mrs. Firmin McKinnon.
Windsor has started a musical union of its own
and held its first sing-song at Lutwyche. Collings
guided the songbirds, among whom was Brisbane’s
pet basso, Ted England. Lottie Richter and Mrs.
W. Collings accompanied, and the choir and orchestra
chorused Handel in a way that Handel would have
liked them to. Mrs. Church supped the famished
artists afterwards.
Sir Matthew gave a dinner party to the Bruches,
Maekays, R. J. McNabs and Tullys, Judge and
Mrs. Shand, the S. F. Macdonalds, the Gilbert Lees
and G. S. Colmans.
Archbishop Duhig handed out the prizes at the
Alma Mater Hall, Nudgee College. The Acting
Premier and Chief Justice McCawley listened
amongst the crowd, and a concert was given by the
pupils. J. E. Barry is the fourth Rhodes Scholar
Nudgee has produced, Neal Macrossan being the
first.
A regiment of Masons glittered round Grand-
master Quinn in Toowong Cemetery the other day
when he stripped the coverings off the memorial
erected to the late J. H. R. Lewis, who was faithful
to the ideals of Masonry for 45 years. A room for
aged Masons at Sandgate is to be a part of the
memorial scheme, for which nearly £3OO was col-
lected.
The Tariff Board has been visiting Brisbane, and
the energetic R.S.A. grabbed the opportunity to
beg it to be a good Australian and do all it could
for the picture industry. Colonel Cameron, Major
Maddocks and otners put the case, and stressed the
fact that not only did Australia get mainly indifferent
and mostly insanitary pictures from the U.S.A., but
actually paid £3,500,000 a year for the privilege.
The Diggers of course haven’t got what they want,
but they are quite satisfied that things are coming
their way.
Norman Stewart Millar, successor to Chaplain-
Colonel Merrington in our St. Andrew’s Kirk, will
have no easy task filling the big boots of his pre-
decessor. He comes from N. S. Wales, is Australian-
born, a Digger, a graduate of Sydney, and young
for his job.
Mrs. K. E. McGill ivray, widow of Alexander Sykes
McGillivray, who took up Eddington in the early
days, died lately at Cloncurry. She was president
of the local branch of the Country Women’s Associa-
tion, and had helped Cloncurry to make the best of
its remoteness for 44 years.

Gloaming was fated not to meet The Night
Patrol at Flemingtori, Greenwood and Mason deciding
to withdraw him from the Linlithgow Stakes on
Oaks Day and the C. B. Fisher Plate on Saturday
owing to the state of the track. He is never at
his best when it is damp underfoot. There were
only three starters for the Fisher Plate, and Lily-
pond, despite his fine Hotliam Handicap success and
Ins sterling fourth in the Cup, was the outsider at
3’s. Spearfelt was at 6 to 4 and The Night Patrol
at 13 to B—for a time it was sto 4. The Derby
winner and the Governor’s horse led until a furlong
from home, where Lily pond ranged up on the out-
side. Spearfelt was squeezed out, The Night Patrol
stopped to nothing, and the Westralian chestnut won
by four lengths; he was going away at the finish.
Lilypond struck trouble in the Cup, but as most of
those who finished about him suffered likewise, he
was possibly beaten on his merits. Still there are
few better horses racing in Australia to-day.
Dempsey rode him a clever race; it was the bov’s
sixth win in eight days.
The Holt stable planked a lot of its Lilvpond
winnings on Easingwold in the V.R.C. Handicap.
It was very bad policy, for the other Westralian
(hestnut has never shown a liking for a mile and
three-quarters, and he was the last to finish. Murray
King (12’s) led all the way and the judge placed
him four lengths ahead of honest old Jackstaff, with
Our Prince a moderate third.
Sir Dighloek’s connections should profit by more
than the money over his success in the Batman Stakes.
Although he has been foolishly raced out of his
distance, and now looks a little sick of it, the
brown Sir Dighton—Charlock colt made an exhibi-
tion of the respectable three-vear-olds opposed to
him. Thereby he proved that bight are as manv
furlongs as he cares to travel, but he can travel
over eight. In the Flemington Stakes Manaere
(5 to 4) jumped away smartly for once, and was
three lengths in front of Petunia at the end. He
is decidedly the better of the pair anti the finest
two-year-old seen out this season. The Peithias
people obtained a nice price—B's—about their im-
ported stallion in the Final Handicap. He had
finished fast in the mile Yan Yean Stakes on the
Tuesday, arid was very favorably handicapped com-
pared with those who had beaten him. He had a
good lead at the entrance to the straight, but
Tookarby (4’s) caught him at the half-distance only
to be worried out of it by the English horse's reso-
lution and O’Sullivan’s fine riding. Peithias got there
by a neck, with Antarian (33’s) just behind Took-
arby, and the favorite, All Sunshine, fourth. It was
appropriate for an English horse to win the last
race of a meeting at which Backwood and The Night
Patrol had been so conspicuous.
( Inron : Edmund Fisher was a twelve-
month too soon with his rhyminS Cup prophecy “In
Back wood’s Year” (B. 25/10/’23). And it was written
that the fine old journalist was not to see the
English horse come good and justify the oft-expressed
opinion of “0.K.” that he was a thorough stayer.
“Bunty” Brown had a hard ride on the son of
Bachelor's Double. His mount was last to leave the
straight, as Purser had been in the Caulfield Cup,
but rounding the home turn his almost white jacket
was prominent among the leaders. Naturally rider
and horse were “all out” at the finish—and what
a finish it was, with Backwood a head in front of
Stand By and the same distance between Spearfelt
and Lilypond! There has rarely been one like it
in the Cup ; as a rule, two horses fight it out, lengths
ahead of the rest, as Bitalli and Rivoli did last year,
and King Ihgoda and The Cypher in 1922. ‘ But
for the slight mishap to Stand By on the morning of
the race, Seobie might have led in his third successive
winner; as it was, Lewis considers that, had he
been able to apply the whip at a critical stage in-
stead. of concentrating his attention on avoiding a
collision with Spearfelt, who came in on him, he
would have got the bonny black horse home. “A
good thing beaten,” was Lewis’s remark after the event.
O’Sullivan is of the same opinion as regards Spear-
felt, who was interfered with during the race, as
also was Lilypond. Brown Rajah was a creditable
fifth, and should pay his way in Perth, where he is
to be taken by his owner, the taciturn Cockram.
“Hamer”; There was at least one woman with a
sense of gratitude in the crowd at Flemington cn
November 4. She left for home after the big race, and
the gatekeeper knew by her glowing, happy face
that she was one of the lucky ones. She pressed a
small tip into his unreluctant hand; then she
paused and returned, feeling in her purse. “I want
to leave this two shillings here,” she said. “When
he comes out, do you mind giving it to the jockey
who rode Backwood ?” Then, with the air of one
satisfied that she had behaved in the proper spirit,
she rustled away.
“H. Hardupp”: Early on Cup morning the Mel-
bourne police gathered in a roysterer who had evi-
dently been having happy dreams. He explained that he
had backed Stand By, and ever since its victory
he had been celebrating. A friendly John pointed
out that the Cup hadn’t been run yet; it wouldn’t
be run until that afternoon. “’Stonishing ! ” remarked
the inebriated one, blinking mistily at his captors,
“ifos’ ’stonishing.” The Hops said that there was
nothing particularly amazing about it —-the Cup was
usually run on Cup afternoon. “But it’sli mos’
’stonishin’ ” persisted the drunk. “If it’sh Cup Day
again, 1 mush ’ave beep shelebratin’ a ’ole year.”
Then, as he showed a tendency to weep on the con-
stable’s bosom whilst he wondered boozily what his
poor wife would think about his long absence, the
indignant officer firmly put him to bed in a cell and
left him to rock himself to sleep.
* * * •*
“IT. Hardupp” : The V.R.C. committee is
finding it very difficult to answer the indignant
questions put to it by those who maintain that
Flemington is being run in the interest of a small
privileged class. Out of £186,478 received in
revenue by the big club last year, £146,156 came
directly from the public and only £9242 from
members’ subscriptions; yet of £200,000 spent on
alleged improvements over three-quarters went in
spoiling the ground to make the new exclusive mem-
bers’ stand. A member pays only six guineas a year,
for which sum he and two ladies are admitted on
16 race days—-roughly 2s. 6d. per person per day.
Compare this with the 13s. 6d. (extra for the bird-
cage) which the non-member is expected to pay for
grandstand admission without any frills. And then
there is a reciprocal agreement with clubs in other
States which entitles the V.R.C. member, to preferen-
tial treatment at Randwick, Morphettville, Eagle
Farm an l such-like courses. Apart from the V.R.C.
there is a general consensus of opinion that members
should pay more for their privileges and the public
less.
* * * *
Like her more famous half-brother, David,
Encre prefers Randwick to courses with sharp turns.
At Moorefield on November l she failed badly in a
six-furlong handicap for which she was a red-hot
favorite, but in the Flying Welter at headquarters
on Saturday she was always in the picture, and had
the better of a rousing finish with imported Friars-
dale, who was followed home by Flippinere and the
improving Torbellino. The backing of Friarsdale,
a four-year-old chestnut by Friar Marcus—-Vinilla,
and evidently smart, enabled the Newcastle crowd to
get 7’s and 6’s about Encre, who shapes as if a bit
of distance wouldn’t trouble her. Another good
Randwick horse to do it again was Sea Risk, who
beat consistent Nygee and the favorite, Inia’s Boy,
in the Liverpool Handicap. Partly because he was
ridden by a little-known
jockey the public let
him go out at B’s. An-
other obscure youth,
riding the unthought-of
Sunbee (33 to 1
offered), game McShort-
odds a skinner in the
Warwick Handicap, the
principal race of the
day; the mannikin
drove his mount to the
front and the others
fatuously waited for
him to come back-
waited too long. The
previous winner had
been a 20-to-l shot in
Goldbeater, and not one
favorite’s number was
hoisted first. A glad
day for the gent, be-
hind the bag.
C. W. CROPPER,
secretary of
the A .J.C.
Parvenu, who is owned by Colin Stephen, the
A.J.C. chairman, was a 6-to-4 favorite for the Hurdle,
but shaped so poorly and behaved so queerly in
his stall after the race that a veterinary surgeon was
sent for. The vet., after taking swabs, expressed
the opinion that the animal had been drugged with
atropine, probably by some skulking ruffian who
sneaked into the stable in the morning. There are
some nefarious scoundrels “in the game” nowadays.
And they will continue to infest it until betting is
restricted to the totalisator and the publication of
handicaps is forbidden till 11 a.m. on a race day,
whereupon their occupation will be gone.
Tliore are not many real stayers in Aus-
tralia nowadays, and very few raced at Eagle Farm
for the £l5OO Queensland Cup. Serelot, the Q.T.C.
Derby winner, was favorite, but was done with a
long way from home, and Warwick Gun lost nis
chance by whipping round at the barrier. Mem-
craft, who had run third in the Q.T.C. Derby,
waited on Sim Dallis and the old Sydney horse
Earl Derby for a mile and five furlongs and came
into the straight with a commanding lead, which he
increased in the run to the judge’s box. Mountain
Song was a bad second and Ship a worse third.
The winner, who started at 6’s, is by imported
Polvcraft out of Memfi, whose dam was a daughter
of Mentor. He is owned by Kennedy and Pattison
and was ridden by Gorman.
On the strength of his performances at
the recent secondary-schools sports
in Perth, Ted Hantke, of the
local High School, must be ac-
counted the best all-rounder of
his age in the Commonwealth.
On a grass track which is never
really fast, Hantke won the 100
yards in 10 l-ssee., the 220 in
23 4-ssec., the 440 in 53 l-ssee.,
the high jump (sft. Bin.), the
long jump (21ft. 6in.) and was
second in the 120 yards hurdles.
And he is not yet 18. Hantke’s
figures for the 100 and for the
high and long jumps have never
been equalled at the English
public-schools championships, in
which youths of 18 and 19 from
Eton, Harrow, Repton, Haileybury,
Charterhouse, Wellington, Shrews-
bury, Rugby, Merchant Taylors and
numerous -other schools take part.
Prudently handled for the next
couple of years, and reserved for
either sprinting or jumping, he
should be an Olympic possibility
in 1928. But the chances are
that he will be a back-number at
21, like so many other smart
youngsters who were allowed to
overdo it at school sports.
H. Ilardupp': Melbourne’s method of
regulating traffic at busy street intersections gave a
joyous citizen the idea of a new sport the other day.
He first plunged into the limelight when the police-
man g;ave the signal to the banked-up human tide
waiting at Young and Jackson’s corner to cross Swan-
ston-street. With a cheerful whoop he sprinted to
the Cathedral corner, barely touching the edge of
the kerb ; thence he dashed across Plinders-street to
where there happened to be no traffic to speak ot,
made a fine run towards the main station entrance
just as the signal for the Hwanstou-street traffic to
cross again was being given, and came back with the
stream to the Young and Jackson corner. “That’s one
’ome to me!” he gurgled delightedly; and while he
got wind up for another bout he explained the
situation to interested bystanders. The eorner-to-
corner method of street crossing had reminded him
of rounders—you ran round your bases, and if the
traffic knocked you between bases you were “out.”
He broke off the explanation to make another bril-
liant home run, amidst the encouraging shouts of
some onlookers; but his third run was checked by
a J. Hop justly indignant at the fracture of the
citj r by-laws. Then the game was suspended until
the inventor could interview the Police Commissioner,
and, by showing him its manifold beauties, induce
him to legalise it.

The All Blacks’ bag last week included
Ulster (the Ireland team, bar four forwards), whom
they beat 28 —6, and Northumberland, defeated at
N ewca st le-on - Tyne by 27 points to 4 —a field goal
by Cotheside, the English international. For the
next few matches, the Maorilanders will be up
against the big London clubs, including Blackheath,
the Harlequins and London Scottish, and then come
the games against Oxford and Cambridge.

Chagrin at having to forfeit a sheaf of
walking records through the absence of the regula-
tion timekeepers on Nov. 1 didn’t prevent George
Parker from establishing a new lot a week later.
In the contest for the seven miles Australasian
title on the Sydney Sports Ground the 28-,vear-old
policeman outclassed his opponents. He led through-
out. and had rested for 2min. lOsec. when A. C.
Kitchen (N.S.W.) arrived at the head of the others
with E. N. Smith (N.S.W.) and Y. Dowling (Vic.)
following. Parker put new figures in the book for
four miles (29min. 42 4-ssec\), five miles (37min.
28sec.), six miles (45min. 19isec.) and seven miles
(53min. 7sec.) ; and all N.S.W. records went after
the first mile.

‘’A.A.”: A troupe of boxers which includes
George Pearson and Llew Edwards struck a snag at
Devonport (Tas.) Show, in the person of a Chinese,
Tommy Lees, who earns a crust by washing and iron-
ing clothes at Burnie. Thomas first stayed three ljmin.
rounds with Pearson and collected £2. Then he
was offered £3 if he lasted four 2min. rounds with
the same man. On going into the tent he was over-
heard to say he would “knock urn sleepin’ dis time,”
and “knock urn sleepin' ” he did, receiving an extra
pound for the feat. The fighting Oriental then went
three lVminute rounds with Llew Edwards ( £3), and
four more 2-min. rounds with Pearson ( £3). Flushed
with success he asked for another go with “dat fat
feller,” meaning Edwards. It was the end of his
run of luck; the former lightweight champion
“knocked um sleepin’ ” in two rounds.

The Vic.-South Aus. match settled down
into the full week of hard graft which (given good
weather) any well-contested game on the Adelaide
Oval now means. Over-careful batting—only 40
runs before the lunch-interval on two occasions!—
was a marked feature. The Croweaters led almost
everywhere but at the winning-post. They seemed
to have a mortgage on the game with a first knock
of 518, a lead of 175 on the innings, and six of
the visitors out for 236. Then the weakness of the
local bowling was found out once more, also the
level strength of Victoria’s batting, and Mayne’s team
won, just at the end of the sixth day, by three
wickets. Grimmett, who has lately moved from
Melbourne to Adelaide, did all the bowling at one
end, like George Giffen in old days, and took 5
wickets (out of 9) for 97, and 4 (out of 7) for
170. He also batted creditably, and showed himself
a good understudy for Mailey, if needed. On the
Victorian side, another migrant, Hendry, stood out.
In addition to getting 7 wickets for 217, he scored
18 and 109 not out, and it' was that century which
won the game for his side. Ponsford (77) and
Woodfull (67), after failing in the first innings, also
came to light when runs were sorely needed, and
Liddicutt, although for once his bowling didn’t come
off, made 88 for once out.
Then the tired S.A. XI, fortified by the veteran
Whitty, went straight on to tackle England, but had
the advantage of first knock. Tate looks the most
difficult of the new bowlers; with very little run,
he gets great pace—and a nip off the pitch—by a
fierce downward swing of the arm. Tyldeslev's
burly figure is used to send up slow stuff that can
be dangerous, unless he loses his length. The two
THE JUST WORD.
“'S ’e ever tip yer?”
“Now and then. But I call it ’ush money."
Richardsons gave S.A. a grand start, after a couple
of wickets had fallen cheaply, bringing the score
to 222 before the captain was unlucky enough to
step on his wicket while cutting a ball. His tally
was 86 ; his namesake eclipsed it with a masterful
innings that left him unbeaten with 192. to his credit
when stumps were drawn. With 346 for 4, the
State looked in an almost unassailable position. Yet,
at the end of the second day they had exchanged
it for a precarious one, and at the end of the third
for an absolutely hopeless one.
Rain fell overnight with sufficient effect on the
pitch to convince the home skipper that it had
converted a batsman’s wicket into a bowler’s one.
Hence, when Arthur had completed his 200, Vic.
“declared.” This may have been good tactics in
theory, but it panned out disastrously. Hobbs and
Sutcliffe opened cautiously vet confidently, and it was
soon apparent that the bowling wasn’t good enough to
get rid cheaply of any of England’s most reliable
run-getters—and stonewallers at need, as Hearne
proved—even on a pitch that was playing trickily.
Whitty, who was expected to rise to the occasion,
didn’t. Before half the side were out, the South
Aus. score had been passed. After this the tail went
cheaply enough, but the mischief was done. The
Englishmen’s total reached 406, with Woolley (90),
Hearne (78), Sutcliffe (75), Hobbs (50) and Hen-
dren (42) the star contributors. Grimmett bowled
best, with 4 for 87 ; Whitty came with a rush at
the end, accounting for the last four men.
South Australia’s second innings resulted in dismal
collapse, Y. Richardson (28), Pritchard (31) and
Ambler, who hit pluckily for 19 at the close, being
the only ones to reach double figures. Gilligan and
Tate, who opened, desisted after the former had
taken two wickets and the latter one ; it was Hearne
who worked the damage, with 5 for 17, getting both
Richardsons, 1.b.w., with successive balls, and Douglas
took 2 for 29. The Englishmen were left with only
43 to make to win, and got them for one wicket
(Sutcliffe’s) —a queer ending to a match where their
opponents had occupied the wickets the whole of
the first day and lost only four men.
There is hardly one branch of sport in
which women nowadays are not interested; but
always the country girl is at a disadvantage com-
pared with her city sister, who is usually handy to
a professional to correct her faults or improve her
style. The Woman’s Mirror —the new woman’s weekly
to be published by Tiib Bulletin —will bring sound
advice, written by champions in every branch, within
reach of everyone. In the first issue “Lady Ex-
Champion” will talk to beginners at golf, and later
to more advanced players. Each week a special
article on sport for women will be included. In
addition, every other feminine interest will be served.
The first issue will appear on November 25, and it
will be the best three-penn’orth ever offered to Aus-
tralian women.

“Past Grammar” : A unique feature of the
N. S. Wales first and second elevens, chosen to meet
the Englishmen and Queensland on Nov. 21 and 23
respectively, is the fact that each includes a Queens-
lander. Nothling, of the first XI, who hails from
Brisbane Grammar, is also a State Rugby' rep., and
has thus achieved the rare distinction of a cricket
and football double. A medium-pace right-hand
bowler, he has had a fair experience in the State
second XI, and played with the first team against
Hill’s XI in the Howell benefit match. With a little
help from the pitch, he has got some remarkable
averages in grade games, but has done nothing much
so far in bigger cricket. He is a fast-scoring, hard-
driving type of batsman. Mayes, who goes into the
second team, is a Toowoomba product, and, like
Nothling, is at Sydney Uni. He is a tall, right-
hand, fast-medium bowler, with an' attractive action
and pace off the pitch.
COMPENSATIONS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Speaking' at the Adelaide reception to the English-
men, Mr. M. A. IS'oble said he thought that a lot of
good would be done if England carried off tie
whole of the Test matches. It would benefit the
game in Australia, by raising a keener >piiit of
competition, and it would also do an immense amount
of good for the game in the Old Country.”
It might detei our bowlers crack and over-petted
bats
From ordering, habitually too large a size in hats,
And cock the poor old Lion’s tail that four years
back begun
To droop, and fell between his legs in nineteen-
twenty-one.
Tiie uses of adversity, as Shakspeare said, are sweet;
A keener zest for triumph burns in those who’ve
known defeat;
And conquering armies ere to-day have got into a
mess
Grown fibre-slack with victory and sated with success.
How many a Yorkshire heart would throb with re-
awakened pride,
How lightened be the gloom that fell upon the
Surrey side
When Armstrong’s near-invincibles pervaded English
swards,
What joy there’d be at Brighton Hove, what deep
content at Lords,
If doughty Gilligan and Co., with many a hefty
smack
And bowling wiles scarce glimpsed as yet, should
win those laurels back!
Yet, if the tide were turned at last and Englar. I’s
stock went up,
I wonder how the barrackers would take the bitter
cup.
I wonder would it soothe their souls, whene’er disaster
came,
Renee ting that their side being tanned would benefit
the game ;
And would they search their repertoires for comments
to attest-
That being walloped now and then is physic of the
best.
I wonder would exultant whoop or voluble complaint
Gic e place to philosophic calm and decorous re-
straint ;
Or if his altruistic creed a Noble could instil
Into the men who bare their souls to Heav’n—
from the hill.

THE INKY WAY.
Mrs. Emma Hornblower, just dead at South Yarra,
aged 98, was the widow of that fine old inky-wayfarer,
John Hornblower, who 30 years ago and more owned
and edited the Inglewood (Vic.) paper.
“Coot”: C. J. de Garis is the new T est proprietor of
the Geelong Standard, and H. J. Stephens is its
managing editor. The Standard has for its reptile
contemporary Victoria’s oldest newspaper, the Gee-
long Advertiser, founded by John Pasco Fawkner
84 years ago.
The Melbourne University Press will publish early
next year a “Bibliography of Australasian Poetry
and Verse” by Percival Serle. As there are to be
included particulars of over 2600 volumes and
pamphlets by nearly 1500 authors, the volume, which
represents years of laborious research, looks like
being a bulky affair.
The N.S.W. Western districts lost one of their
best-known journalists when Robert Newton died
the other day. Born in the Cold Country 45 years
ago, Australian journalism caught him early. Start-
ing on the Orange Advocate as a boy, he became
part-proprietor 18 years ago, only knocking off for
a spell of two years to help in the argument with the
Kaiser.
Dr. J. S. Battve, Public Librarian of Westralia,
has written a book, “Western Australia: A History
from its Discovery to the Inauguration of the Com-
monwealth,” which is to be published by the Oxford
University Press. Battye has been 20 years eating
his way through piles of evidence in the Public
Record Office and Colonial Office to get his informa-
tion.
Passed out in the Solomon Islands, Geoffrey H.
Statham, a man who wanted to be an artist and
tried as hard as anybody The Bulletin knows—how
many hundreds of his sincere efforts it has been
obliged to decline this paper is almost ashamed to
remember. Statham was educated at Sydney Gram-
mar and King’s School, and went to the Solomons 16
years ago under engagement to the Solomon Island
Development Co. He finally took up trading and
planting on his own account. Blackwater fever
killed him.
From R. W. Kenderdine, General President of the
A.J.A.: The par. in The Bulletin of Oct. 16 re-
garding “deadheads” has been read by the Federal
Executive of the A.J.A. ; and while the facts as
stated may be accepted as correct in the instances to
which it refers, the inference should not be drawn
that the practices complained of are general, or that
they are condoned by pressmen. Entertainment pro-
moters and newspaper proprietors alike may rely
upon the co-operation of this association in any
efforts they may make to prevent such malpractices.
“X.N.0.”: So many nautical expressions, such as
“taken aback,” have been adopted for use
ashore, that I am puzzled why no place has yet been
found for that peculiarly expressive phrase “warming
the bell.” It would be handy to denote people who
stop work sufficiently long before knock-off time to
ensure that they shan’t be late when the whistle
goes. At sea the bell is usually struck by the
boatswain’s mate ; at the end of his watch he gener-
ally stands by it, with his hand on the tongue, ready
to strike, for some minutes before eight bells. The
heat of his hand warms the tongue. Hence the
expression.
“Rita”: S. Aus. inky-wayfarers are being pro-
vided with some new roads to prospect. The News
is making a feature of short stories by local writers,
and is accepting articles from outsiders for the
leader page. Its Sunday paper, the Mail, invites
contributors to its “Open Air Columns.” The
Journal —the week-end issue of the Register —is
a buyer of pars, and stories. The Gossip —a
new weekly which has swallowed up the ancient
and struggling Critic —offers a small market for para-
graphists, authors and black-and-white men. If
things go on improving, there may even come a
time when a freelance will be able to earn a crust
in Adelaide.
“Two Seas”: Gohannavale is one of the few really
cultured towns I have met inland. Soon after arriving
there I learned that it possessed a Browning Society,
where strangers were always welcome. Their meeting
place, I further learned, was one of the lodge-rooms
at the Queerfellows’ Hall, and seeing it lit up one
night I went in. A youth was reciting with out-
stretched arms. His impassioned style was convinc-
ing, and the words he reeled off seemed vaguely
familiar, but I couldn’t place them in my edition
of Browning. I began to think the youth had got
bushed looking for Waring, when suddenly a line
caught my attention: “As the sulphurous smoke doth
drifteth away.” That didn’t sound like my favorite
poet, and I grew suspicious. “Is this the Browning
Society?” I inquired of a tough-looking citizen beside
me. “Blime, no!” he whispered hoarsely. “You’ve
strayed inter the opposition’s room. This is the
Bellerive Society.” I apologised and did silently
drifteth away.
“A.M. J.”: It comes as a shock to me to find that
the “dead heart” of Australia has now been dis-
covered, for literary purposes, by John Galsworthy.
To reach it you must sail along the W.A. coast for
a few days, and then trek inland, accompanied by
pack-mules and black “fellas.” Choose the season
when the ghastly sandstorms are past, for they
obliterate everything for miles, and travel for two
days. En route you may meet stationowners who
have “a rangy stare of intent vacancy—the look
of the bush, that peculiar, half-vacant intensity of
great spaces and utter loneliness.” Residence in
W.A., one learns, gives to the countenance this
“drained, strained look.” You may allay your thirst
by sucking limes, and hear “the thin music of a
black fella blowing on a shell.” In due course you
will reach “the edge—beyond this is nothing but
limitless, unwatered, waste.” The hero ‘ has been
lured there in search of an underground river with
which to irrigate the desert into an Eden of alfalfa,
and tomatoes, but he gets a shock when he finds his
guide—a 20-years’ desert-dweller (and, of course, the
son of an Oxford don) —who has gone ahead to locate
the spot in a huddled heap on the sand —“a little
black pipe in his hand, a little yellow dribble at
the corner of his smiling lips, a film over his staring
eyes.” “A reek came to Cursitor’s nostrils. God!
he thought. Opium!” For those who know their
W.A. as she really is, what utter rubbish is this for
an author like Galsworthy to perpetrate!

If a Chinese playwright scampered from
Perth to Brisbane by train and then hurried
back to China and wrote a play about us,
his Chinese audience would doubtless go
home after the performance with the com-
fortable feeling that the Australians who
paraded their racial superiority were really
a set of crude barbarians, inclined to big-
amy, addicted to crimes of violence and
obsessed with the idea that civilisation means
dust, noise and hustle instead of the culti-
vation of intellectual pleasures. W. Somer-
set Maugham’s picture of Chinese life in
“East of Suez,” presented by Muriel Starr
and Frank Harvey at Sydney Criterion, is
probably as near the truth as that; and
certainly the incidental music is only a cari-
cature of the best Chinese music, which aims
at being so soft as to be scarcely heard. This
Sundry Showman wishes also to protest on
behalf of those Australian mothers who have
reared families in “the East” against Eily
Malyon’s libel on the Amah, the lady in the
sloppy blue pants at whose wise, patient
and solicitous breast Britain’s empire in
Asia has been largely suckled.
* * * *
In Daisy, the Eurasian girl, Muriel
Starr has an exacting part, which she plays
with commendable restraint and a “chichi”
accent which would be a passport any day
to the select circles of Datoh Kramat,
to the select circles of Datoh Kramat.
I’enang; Bras Basah-road, Singapore; or
Gage-street, Hongkong. Girton College has
fashioned Daisy into a typical English girl.
She returns to her half-native land to find
she is a rebel from Chinese society and an
outcast from European. She becomes the
mistress of Lee Tai Chung, a wealthy, and,
of course, tortuous Chinaman, satisfactorily
depicted by Frank Hawthorne. The desire
to better herself still persists, however, and
when she meets Maurice Tuohy (Henry
Anderson in the play), a young English
griffin who in his greenness regards his coun-
trymen’s dislike of half-castes as snobbery and
not a sound biological sense, she marries
him and removes him outside the European
pale to the neighborhood of a Chinese temple.
Frank Harvey, as George Conway, an ambi-
tious young diplomat who has been once
bitten by Daisy,, gets over his shyness and
comes back for more. Pie is captured by
the lady’s ruthless sensuality, and is false
to his friend, her husband, ending by blow-
ing his brains out in disgust at his own
treachery. The composite Daisy has thus
effectively revenged herself on the white

man and Eddie Russell in specialty
dances.
society of Peking; and with Oriental callous-
ness she assumes a magnificent Chinese
gown, sits down in the midst of the ruin
sue has caused, gets out her vanity-box,
paints her cheeks like a Chinese bride and
waits for the sinister Lee Tai Chung to come
and claim her.
An all-round capable cast interpreted an
extremely difficult play with distinction.
Frank Harvey was quietly efficient as George
Conway ; and Roger Barry, as Harold Knox,
a typical young British philistine, was re-
freshingly robust. A succession of elegant
stage settings, near enough to the real thing
to pass muster, a lot of gong-banging and a
smell of burning joss-sticks created the neces-
sary atmosphere, which might have been
further enhanced by the passing round
amongst the audience of hot towels, melon-
seeds, pots of tea and cuspidors, since these
are indispensable concomitants of a theatri-
cal performance in China.
If Shakspeare had been ordered to drama-
tise the British elections he would have done
it much on the lines of the Forum scene in
“Julius Caesar,” with Mark Antony (the
Conservative party) pointing to the seven
and thirty wounds dealt to Caesar (the British
Constitution) by those traitors to the State,
Brutus, Cassius, etc. (the Labor party), and
finishing by reading the will (the Zinovieff
letter) to the weeping crowd: which shows
that, although he did not know the word for it,
Shakspeare knew all about the thing we call
“mob psychology.” In his season at Sydney
Palace. Allan Wilkie has done only about
two things better than his presentation of
this scene, and on that account may be for-
given the injudicious cutting that marred
the final act. William Lockhart failed to
distil the bitter humor stored in the part of
Casca, but Claude Saunders made a noble
and deliriously handsome Brutus; while
burnt cork assisted Leslie Manners to modi-
fy his sleekness to' the lean and hungry needs
of Cassius.
William Heughan’s Sydney season started
last week at the Conservatorium. The good
Scot’s voice proved all that it is claimed to
be, but his diction something less than an
Australian listener might hope for. The pro-
gramme ranged from operatic to folk-song,
the most successful of the latter being
“Jenny Dang the Weaver” and “The Carl
o’ Kellyburn.” In Moussorgsky’s “Flea”
Heughan never fails to capture his audience;
and his dramatic Border ballads bring down
the house. Gladys Sayer, the accompanist,
plays solo numbers with charm, and Lilian
Pether’s violin is an added attraction.
At Sydney Opera House Seymour Hicks
will introduce “Broadway Jones” to a dis-
cerning public on Saturday night, with Ella-
line Terriss as the quick-witted stenographer.
The four acts are packed with love and
laughter.
The end of “Whirled Into Happiness” is
in sight at Sydney Majesty’s; Alfred Frith,
Winnie Collins and the other blithe spirits
will spin into felicity for eight more nights
only.
“The Cousin from Nowhere” continues to
demonstrate himself a blow-in of inexhaus-
tible resource and infinite humor at Sydney
Royal. The ballets are gladsome incidents
in a mirthful show.
Sydney Tivoli’s latest guests include Scott
and Whaley, a pair of soot-faced comedians.
Scott is the better of the two, but the pair
mix well, and their offerings are a floor above
the average coon-stuff. Long-legged Rich
Hayes moves as if in a dream, yet his jug-
gling should earn him a place in the slips of
afiy cricket team. Bert Levy is as entertain-
ing as ever. Some days he works three
shifts, the extra one being a free treat for
kiddies or in aid of a hospital. And Alice
Lloyd is still singing her snappy songs with
a kick in the refrain.

Stiffy and Mo have changed their nation-
ality, and appear this week a’t Fullers’
Theatre, Sydney as Mexicans. While they
throw little light on the character of the
Irish-descended. Alvero Obregon, who wears
the golden sombrero which this republic’s
president is understood to sport, their humor-
ous antics continue to delight the plebeians.

This week Norma Talmadge is keep-
ing “Secrets” at Hoyt’s and wearing the
costumes proper to the different periods of a
life of 60 years. Herbert Rawlinson tiptoes
up the “Dark Stairways” after Norma has
her spin, and bumps all the trouble he wants.
“The Guilty One” is in hiding at the Cry-
stal Palace, and on the carpet at the same
show lies the corpse of the intruder in a
triangular affair. Students of form will find
“Loving Cup” a trier at the Globe; and
Nellie Stewart’s daughter Nancye, who
accompanies her husband, Mayne Lynton,
at interval-time, is also worth a look. “His
Brother’s Keeper” finds his job difficult at
the Empress ; and the Strand is the address
of the “Romance Ranch.” “Chu Chin Chow”
w r ill drop into the Palace next Saturday.
Alfred O’Shea lately discovered to his
amazement that the Melbourne Town Hall
was unbooked for Cup night; so grasping
the opportunity with both hands he put on
a concert which artistically was the best
event of that evening. To assist him O’Shea
had Francois Stempinski, a Polish violinist
who has reached Australia after the usual
adventures. Stempinski has a very fine tech-
nique, but he rather exaggerates the desire
to avoid exaggeration in his expression: his
restraint spoilt one or two items calling for
passionate interpretation. Lalo’s Symphonic
Espagnol was his finest number. O’Shea
himself gave play to a voice of sympathy,
which was possibly best used in “Waft Her,
Angels” (Handel). There was not an even
excellence in all his numbers ; but generally
the offerings were acceptable in spite of
some inaccuracies in tonal treatment. F. J.
Nott was accompanist.
** * *
To-night (13th) “The Rise of Rosie
O’Reilly” joins the list of shows which have
had unbroken runs of a hundred nights ; and,
content with the score, the cheerful message
that “there is nothing like a darned good cry
to wash all your troubles away” will be heard
for the last time to-morrow. During its 12
weeks “Rosie” has been easily the best draw
in Melbourne: the staging of “Tons of
Money” by the same co. on Saturday night
seems like an apt advt. of the box office’s
satisfaction.

Exactly what the giddy Lord Trenham
called a parson who was too shocked to re-
peat the words is explained to the audience
at Melbourne King’s every night at 10.30
p.m. or thereabouts; the audiences, well
satisfied with the fare preceding it, show no
signs of growing tired.

Gladys Moncrieff comes back to the Royal
Comics on Saturday night (15th), when
William Heughan,
the Scottish singer,
now in Sydney.
“The Maid of the
Mountains” will re-
introduce her at
Melbourne
Majesty’s. The re-
vival is for six
nights only; then
follow “A South-
ern Mi aid” and
“T he Merry
W i d o w.” The
weakly-cast “Lady
of the Rose” dies
to-morrow night:
one hopes to renew
acquaintance with
it in better circum-
stances.
The best charac-
terisation in the
world would not
keep “Kempy” from
yielding an impres-
sion of farce if the
action was laid
anywhere but in
America. There,
it is understood,
tawdry ideals pre-
vail which make it
quite possible for
an apparently de-
cently-trained girl
to contract a mar-
riage on a five
minutes’ acquaint-
an c e—w i t li, o f
course, an anti-
cipation of easy divorce afterwards —and
for the tie to be knotted in such a
slipshod fashion that it can be unfastened
easily enough to allow' a happy ending.
Kate Bence, bitten with a craze to make her-
self famous, but without any ability to
justify her ambitions, makes a storm centre
in the Bence family, which desires her to
marry Duke Merrill; but because he refuses
to believe in her talents, she suddenly mar-
ries an amorphous youth who believes—
until he meets her—that he admires her for
them.. The result is a story very amusing
both in the making of the tangle and in its
unravelling—the latter amazingly simple.
But, though it has humor, the play is full
of artistic blemishes. Quite in the American
fashion, the players are at times made to
step right out of character to score a point
of laughter.
* * * *
Nevertheless excellent delineation by the
members of the company now' at the Mel-
bourne .Royal helped it out well. John D.
O’Hara’s easy and convincing sketch of the
dahlar-counting “Dad” Bonce, who irascibly
grumbles about the senseless extravagance of
having 11 umbrellas in the house when it
hasn’t rained for a month, did not stand out
as strikingly as it might have done from a
less well-balanced company. Maggie Moore,
who made a likeable “Ma” Bence, was given
the warmest of receptions ; there was a lot
of life in Ailsa Grahame’s Jane Wade, the
eldest Bence daughter; and Mary Macgregor
was responsible for pleasing work as Ruth,
the unsophisticated youngest daughter.
Kempy James was played by John Fernside,
who has earned rapid stage promotion, and
stepped over from the Starr co. for this
part. He offered a reasonable picture of
the immature and somewhat bewildered
youth, though his inclination to waggle his
head in moments of stress was slightly over-
done. George Blunt, a successful bounderish
estate-agent and husband of Jane, and Har-
vey Adams (Duke Merrill) were satisfac-
and Eileen Sparks did well enough as
the irruptive Kate.
Maidie Scott, at Melbourne Tivoli, has a
song, “The Bird in Nellie's Hat,” which
deserves popularity and has won it. Oswald
M illiams, with a multitude of magical ideas,
is a new arrival; but, although most of his
tricks are interesting and one or two above;
the common, the management has been wise
in not putting his name amongst the electric
signs. He is intolerably slow in developing
some of his mysteries. Charlotte Parry
very cleverly represents eight characters in
her “Comstock Mystery” act, earning ap-
plause by her quick changes; and Vernon
Watson has added a clever impersonation of
Harry Weldon to his act.
The biggest trumpetings in the Melbourne
picture world last week concerned the open-
ing of the new Capitol Theatre, a place rather
stunning in its elaborate magnificence. The
‘Ten Commandments” is the star opening
picture; it gives a disappointment, after a
carefully-worked prologue of ancient days, by
following on with the typical American musii
in a story in which Sin is worked, in the
usual way, for the advantage of the film
producers and their clients, the showmen.
The Majestic has Doris Kenyon in “The
Love Bandit,” and an entertaining stage
story in “The Understudy.” Hoyt’s De Luxe
is allowing Melbourne audiences the oppor-
tunity of hearing Lawrence Power, who won
a special prize offered by the Melbourne Sun
at the Ballarat musical competitions, and was
described by the adjudicator as the possessor
of “a world’s voice.” One would expect a
world voice to be a bit stronger, but the
tenor is very charming in tone. Australia’s
old friend Conway Tearle (he was the star
of Williamson’s first production of “Ben
Hur”) appears in “The Lilies of the Field” ;
and “The Fighting Adventures” has the
thrills usually supplied by a two-fisted young
man in search of diversion.
At Melbourne Olympia Wirtlis’ Circus is
repeating the successes which began long
before Cassius took the kiddies along as an
excuse for seeing the show himself. To the
diversions of one recent night was added the
voice of an enthusiastic youngster whose ad-
miration rose to its highest pitch as a lady
did sprightly things on horseback. The
high-pitched question, “Could you do that,
Grandma?” took the house by storm.
Adelaide shows, excepting for pictures,
are mainly good concerts and the Majestic's
well-balanced variety show, with George Wal-
lace (and co.), Maud Courtney, Bessie Clif-
ford and other clever people. West’s has
Stella Power as soprano, with the film made
in the previous week by Louise Lovely on
the spot. Tile York has the magic of An-
"THE COUSIN FROM NOWHERE,” AT
SYDNEY ROYAL.
Claude Flemming (the stranger) sings good-
night to a pretty maiden, with Stanley
Hodges as Carl in attendance.
stay's old “Brass Bottle’’ amplified in an
effective way; this kind of yarn makes a
great film. Wondergraph relies on the fun
of Buster Keaton and the “sensation” of
Mary li. Rinehardt; the l’av. on high-speed
motoring.

A WAX Finish Denotes Refinement
THROUGH all their centuries the beautiful interiors
of famous European castles and palaces have known
no finish but wax. Perfectly preserved—the waxed
wood mellows and glows with the years. This same
beautiful finish can be easily duplicated on the floors,
woodwork and furniture of any Australasian home with

POLISHING
WAX
Johnson’s Wax is the ideal finish and polish for all your
floors. It will make them beautiful —easy to care for—
they won’t be slippery—and will not heel-print. And
Johnson’s Polishing Wax is, by far, the most economical
finish for floors and linoleum. With waxed floors
expensive refinishing is never necessary, for walked-on
places can be easily and quickly rewaxed as worn spots
appear, without going over the entire floor.
The easy way to wax floors and linoleum is with a
Johnson Weighted Polishing Brush. It spreads the Wax
evenly —polishes the Floor easily—and is an ideal
floor duster.

Face this Fact Squarely—for Your Wife’s Sake!
Healthy' men rarely consider sickness, and death only as some-
thing far off—never an immediate possibility. Naturally they
never bother about protecting their dependants against such an
event. This, no doubt, accounts for the thousands of widows
who, having led protected married lives, are left unprotected
at their husband’s death and are now struggling against unfair
odds to earn a living.
Face this possibility squarely! No man knows the length of
his life! The act of assuring will not lengthen or shorten life
by a day, but it WILL protect dependants against future hard-
ships. See about it without delay at the Producers and Citizens’
Co-operative Assurance Co., Ltd.
The provisions allowed by the P. & C. are unusually liberal, for
it is a Co-operative Company, associated with the most influential
co-operative bodies in the Commonwealth, is soundly founded,
and has a conservative financial policy that ensures stability and
progress.

“Charlik”: You can’t do without the Aus-
tralian chorus. “Lilac Time” lacked the
essential element and the public didn’t take
to it; the same with “The Cousin from No-
where,” which, in other respects, is also a
good show. During the Gilbert and Sullivan
period at London Savoy, there was a waiting
list of COCO aspirants for chorus work, many
of them gold-medallists and licentiates of the
great colleges. The Savoy chorus justly had
a great name, and until I came to Australia
I thought it was pre-eminent. I was stand-
ing beside J. C. Williamson when I first
heard an Australian chorus. I was astounded
and said so. J.C.W. replied “I thought
you’d get a shock!” The Savoy chorus was
outclassed, especially by the girls. The
musical value of present-day productions is
below the average in the G. and S. days, but
there has been no deterioration in the quality
of the Australian chorus, particularly the
feminine portion, and any musical produc-
tion courts failure which lacks its invalu
able aid.
“0. Ockney” : Theatrical interests will be
represented in the new British Parliament by
Alfred Butt and Walter de Frece. Alfred
runs about half a dozen West-end London
playhouses and various variety shows, in-
cluding the Leicester-square Empire, and
Walter (known in the profession as “Vesta
Tilley’s husband”) is at the head of a power-
ful vaudeville syndicate controlling a dozen
or more theatres. Another theatrical knight,
Hall Caine, had two sons running, one of
whom was returned. But Derwent, the
elder, who has been on the boards, was not
elected, although introduced to the voters by
Dad as “a future Prime Minister.” So like
Dad.
“Cato”: Allan Wilkie’s representation of
the banquet scene in “Macbeth” has con-
vinced me that the ghost of Banquo should
no longer be made visible to the audience. It
is purely a subjective ghost, seen by none
of those present except Macbeth himself, and
there is no more reason for materialising it
than there is for exhibiting the “air-drawn
dagger.” Wilkie makes matters worse by
attempting to improve on his author. In-
stead of sitting “in Macbeth’s” place,” the
ghost appears, first on one side of the hall
and then on another, like an elusive sprite.
There is a third (and unauthorised) appear-
ance as Macbeth leaves the hall. Yet if
people titter when the disembodied spirit en-
cores itself, worthy old gentlemen are sure
to write to the papers saying that we moderns
have no appreciation of Shakspeare.
“Kombeeti”: “F.L.H.” is probably wrong
when he says (B. 9/10/’24) that Allan
Wilkie is the thirteenth mummer to play
“Richard III.” in Australia. Anyway,
William _ Creswick was omitted from
“F.L.H.’s” list; he impersonated the blood-
stained sovereign in the old Victoria Theatre,
Sydney, in April, 1878.
_ “J.F.11.” (Lond.) : The trade-union ques-
tion has invaded the theatrical world, and
British actors and “preformers” (as Rickards
used to call them) are now divided into two
camps—those who believe in unionism and
those who don’t. The former belong to the
Actors’ Association and the Variety Artists’
Federation ; the latter adhere to the Stage
Guild, which takes the stand that players
are on a par with painters and sculptors, and
should leave unionism to coal-heavers, tuck-
pointers and the like. Bourchier is a power
m the Actors’ Association, but Harry Lauder,
though a member of the V.A.F., has been
telling the interviewers that in the entertain-
ment world, where everything depends upon
the talent of the individual, union methods
are out of place. Apropos, the V.A.F. lias
issued an announcement to the effect that
there are now about 5000 music-hall artists
in this happy land, of whom a dozen com-
mand £2OO a week when working, two dozen
make £lOO a week (with the same proviso),
and 400 earn from £lO to £4O, but consider
themselves lucky if they get 25 weeks’ work
in the year. A fiver a week is the average,
year in and year out, and out of that come
agents’ fees, railway fares, hotel expenses,
costumes and tips. No wonder there has
been a scamper to Australia.
“Minim”: J. A. E. Malone, the William-
son representative in London, has been talk-
ing in this artless strain to the Referee :
“What about Australia? Well, my firm, J. C.
Williamson, Ltd., has been pulling in magnificent
returns out there with Melba and Dal Monte in grand
opera. These prime clonne have been drawing on the
average £9OOO per week!”
It reminds me that we have heard nothing
lately about the immense loss which the pro-
moters of the enterprise had decided to incur
in the cause of Art.
The first appearance of another star is
booked for this month: on November 25
The Bulletin’s protege, the Woman’s
Mirror, will make its debut; and with 43
years’ experience as a producer, The Bulle-
tin believes it knows a star when it sees
one. Actors, actresses, new plays, pictures
and the people who make them —these will
be but a few of the host of features which

you.”
will make a strong appeal to women. The
fiction will be a strong point; a serial by
Ethel Turner will begin in the first issue.
The organisation behind The Bulletin
enables the new paper to be sold at three-
pence, but it compares more than favorably
with papers at four times the price.
“Ckesar's Ghost” : Heslop’s return to Eng-
land at the • expiration of his contract will
weaken the Hugh Ward combination if it is
permitted. The slick light-comedy merchant
has made good in Australia, and the easy
cheerfulness he imparts to his work has a
lot to do with the smooth running of a
show. If the rotund Kirby goes, too, the
loss will be severe. Kirby has been wonder-
fully successful since he was induced to leave
the Petersham (N.S.W.) amateurs for the
more or less serious stage. He has visions
of a career in the Smoke.
“Machete”: “Pantagruel's” story of the
Westralian pianist who accompanied a pic-
ture of a royal dame’s funeral with “Good-
bye, Little Girl, Good-bye” (B. G/11/’24). re-
calls a service in commemoration of another
deceased monarch. A military band was at
the proceedings, and when they ended it
struck up the lively marching-off tune de-
manded in such cases by military tradition.
Unhappily the air chosen was “I Don’t Sup-
pose We’ll Him Again for Years and
Years and Years.”
“Landa” : More by-products of the movies.
Up our (N.S.W. North Coast) way re-
cently some youngsters tied a rope to an
overhanging tree-branch. A horse was led
under the tree, a boy was placed on its
back and the free end of the rope secured
around his neck. A prod with a sapling
started the horse and left the boy dancing
on air. Some canecutters sprinted up just
in time to save a young Australian. “We-
was actin’ for the pitchers an’ ’augin’ a ’orse-
rustler,” it was coolly explained.
From beside the Thames :
“The Royal Visitor,’’ in which Oscar Asche re-
turned to London, is an adaptation of a French play
based on an amorous adventure of Leopold, King of
the Belgians. The original has had a prodigious
success in Paris, where Leo is still well and unfavor-
ably remembered, though his numerous girls are now
mostly respectable bourgeois grandmothers; but the
translation failed memorably in London. There was.
no part in it for Lily Brayton, but it is announced
that she will appear in the next Asche production.
Mrs. Adelaide Stoll, mother of Oswald Stoll, of
the London Coliseum and a host of other halls and
cinema -theatres, left a tidy £52,000. At one time
she ran a boarding-house in the vicinity of Fitzroy
Gardens, Melbourne, and there Oswald was born. He
always regarded ma as his mascot, and for years
she was his boss of the box-office —in fact, she was
managing that department of the Coliseum a few
days before her death.
A play called “The Claimant,” and founded on the
Tichborne case, is running at the Queen’s Theatre. It
would be hard to make an acceptable hero of the
portly Wagga butcher who was the original Tich-
borne claimant, but the author, a Mrs. Watts, gets
over the difficulty by presenting her impostor as
young and elegant. The main facts of the Tich-
borne case are closely followed, and Fay Compton
scores as the beautiful heiress-cousin with whom the
fascinating young bogus aristocrat from Australia
falls in love.
Word comes from New York that many of the
theatres want disinfecting. The titles of some of
the plays now being performed are “Our Pleasant Sins,"
“A Bachelor’s Night,” “The Woman He Bought,”
“The Hour of Temptation,” “The Revelations of a
Wife,” “My Lady’s Garter,” and hy Women Go
Wrong”; and the Mayor has summoned a confer-
ence of moralists and policemen to see what can be
done about it. His name is Hylan, and when he
goes to Broadway at night he is a Hylan totally
surrounded by “nudity, obscenity and depravity,” so
something will certainly have to be done.
“Lud”: London Stage writes commiser-
atingly on Oscar Asdic’s re-appearance at
Her Majesty’s in the soon dead-and-done-for
“Royal Visitor’":—
_ Mr. Oscar Asohe, though burdened with the ineffec-
tive role of Boudier, might surely have had a more
hearty welcome back on making his professional
rentree at his old “Chu-Chin-Chow” home after his
sojourn down under.
Tlie prophet seemingly was more honored in
his own country, after all.
“Tich” : The epidemic of vaudeville seems
to have spent itself, and the liners arriving
here are no longer bulging with variety stars
from England and the U.S.A. The thing
was absurdly overdone. A good deal of criti-
cism Ims been levelled at the copying of the
big people in advance by the smaller fry on
local boards. But a look at a crowd of
the big guns—or near-big guns—convinces
one that they copy each other. In fact,
imitation in the music-hall business, to call
it by no harsher term, seems to be part of
the game. And the similarity of turns re-
cently imported has contributed to the slump
in attendances. Numerous headliners are
now working out their contracts at picture
■“palaces” and such like inferior pitches, and
doubtless are writing home to say that Aus-
tralian engagements are not what they are
-cracked up to be.
“S.T.S.” : Sydney gets, and Adelaide loses,
Lawrence Power, a tenor. Power has had
an Adelaide Conservatorium training, but he
seemed really astonished when at the recent
Ballarat competitions the Sun prize was
awarded to him, and Alfred Hill reported:
“Voice of rare quality; splendid tempera-
ment for the dramatic; lacks only finishing
training to make him an artist of the first
water.” Hill recommended the startled
youth to go to Italy, but, finding this im-
possible, Power is removing to Sydney Con-
servatorium instead. He is a fine cricketer,
having, at 21, already played for the State and
become captain of the North Adelaide team.
“Nikko”: I’ve always had a great sym-
pathy for the Infant Phenomenon who is
shoved into the limelight by her ambitious
parents, but I met one the other day who
seemed able to look after her own interests.
The concert posters besought the public not
to miss Miss Ilildegarde Ilicks, the Marvel-
lous Child Elocutionist, and we didn’t, though
it was a near thing. When the time arrived
for Miss Ilildegarde’s number there was a
sound of scuffling in the wings, accompanied
hy a shrill voice screaming, “I won’t! I
won’t.” Then a chair was overturned, some-
thing went bang, and we caught a glimpse
of a perspiring gentleman and a stout lady
in red struggling in the wings with what
seemed to be a bundle of pink in a fit.
More screams and bangs, and the pink
bundle was precipitated on to mid-stage,
where it lay and kicked and yelled until
removed bv the owners. The next item came
on hurriedly, and the warm gentleman rushed
out and said to a young man in the front,
brandishing the while a 10s. note: “Go out
and buy her a box of chocolates. She won't
go on without them.” Chocolates duly
arrived, and went behind scenes, and then
the still warmer gentleman scurried out
again. “Get a red box.” lie implored, “she
says she won't have blue.” The red box
was promptly secured, but it was quite half
an hour before Miss Hildegarde tripped on,
a crumpled but triumphant infant.
“T. 0.1.”: From Boston. U.S.A., comes
news of Henry Jewett, a favorite actor at
Her Majesty’s, Sydney, in the ’eighties. For
a time he was “seconds” to George Rignold.
About 25 years ago Jewett went to America,
and in Boston for many years he directed a
company of his own. Nowadays he is. a
spellbinder for the Drys. Jewett married
Frances Robinson, daughter of a one-time
Bathurst draper, who dabbled in politics, and
so became a police-magistrate. He was the
resident beak at Young.
“Philm Up”: In the accounts of the movie
importers’ interview with Pratten, Minister
for Customs, I missed the familiar reference
to the “killing of the industry.” Maybe the
opening of new million-daliler (or is it two-
million-daliler?) picture theatres in both Syd-
ney and Melbourne had something to do with
the neglect to drag in the old gag. Like the
bookies, the movie magnates are always being
killed, but they take an unconscionable time
dying.
“lU. Hardupp”: Some mummers make
their hands act a bit too much ; but I know
of one who failed with portion of his audi-
ence because his hands didn’t act at all.
The portion was a pig-farmer who looked
on with an air of stern disapproval, from the
hero’s cheerful entrance right through the
stirring events of the act. I had met the
critic before, and during the interval we
drank at the same bar. “Stormer’s not a
bad actor,” I said. “A dam’ bad actor!” he
growled. “Comes back sayin’ lie’s been clean-
in’ the pigsties, an ’ee’s ’ands as clean as a
noo pin.”
“Homfrey Beale”: I wish I knew who
used to sing :
The air was dreamy with flowers,
The room was radiant with light,
And the soft old tunes were floating
Away on a calm June night;
And she danced with one and the other....
It had a chorus beginning “Nev-er to
know-w-w, ah, nev-ev.” I remember 80-odd
years ago going to some theatre in Sydney
and hearing it; a great part of the audience
(many of the softer sex weeping unrestrain-
edly, and several of the harder ditto blowing
their noses violently) joined in the chorus.
For me it was a world of tragedy for several
days afterwards.
“Hamfat”: Bland Holt had odd habits
which made him a terror to the tyro. He
would stand in the O.P. entrance, with glar-
ing eyes fixed on the new arrival; and, as
the latter floundered through his part,
Bland’s mobile face would take on an ex-
pression of intense agony, as if a corrosive
poison was gnawing at his innards. Also >
he would elevate his hands, in a frenzied’
fashion, towards the flies. The experience
was so unnerving that the vision of the man-
ager bearing down upon them drove more
than one novice to desperate flight. . Yet
Bland’s greeting was as frequently a remark
that the actor had done quite well.
OUR BOARDING-HOUSE DISCOVERS SPRING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The silver-sandalled dawn arrove,
As is its wont, where I reside,
And wakened many a sleeping cove
To thoughts of eggs and bacon fried.
And in the air, the while we rdse,
Was that which made us blithely sing ;
Ev'n as we clambered into clothes
Our boarding-house discovered Spring.
The “Spring Song” rises from below,
The clash of cups and plates between ;
The cook, manipulating dough,
Is humming snatches of “Doreen.”
“The Anvil Song” a basso bawls
From out some eyrie in the tower;
A bather “Like a Soldier Falls”
Amid the splashing of the shower.
“The Sunshine and the Rain” is heard ;
A parrot adds its screeching bit;
And someone tells a soaring bird
Just all the thoughts he thinks of it.
These native wood notes, wild and good,
Impress us as a pleasant thing,
And serve to show the neighborhood
Our hash-house has discovered Spring.

Hopkinson Valves and
Boiler Mountings
are safest and most durable
It has been established beyond question that the metal used
in Hopkinson Valves and Boiler Mountings is the most reliable
for the purpose. The interchangeable valves and seats are
made of “Platnam” Metal, a special alloy which is not used
in any other make. Tests have demonstrated that it is proof
against corrosion and that steam superheated to the highest
temperature does not injure it. It has been proved also that
“Platnam” metal reduces friction in the valve to a minimum.
m
The top illustration shows a Hopkinson
Steam Trap, in section. These are
made of cast iron or cast steel, and are
fitted with easily renewable “Platnam”
metal valves and seats. Their con-
struction is extremely simple.
The lower photograph shows a
“M.A.C.” Valve, straight through pat-
tern with flanged ends and outside
screw. The body is made of high pres-
sure bronze, specially selected, the seat
and valve of “Platnam” metal. All
joints are effected by metallic contact.

of Hopkinson Steam Fitting—“M.A.C.” Valves, Parallel

The progress towards Perfection, typical of (Bond’s
Iljsiery as a whole is expressed in a special manner
in “Ladderproof,’’ which, to-day, despite its moderate

ON those supremely important dress occasions
when PURE SILK Hosiery is absolutely
essential, Ronds “Ladderproof” may be
chosen with complete confidence that it will har-
monise perfectly with the most expensive Frocking,
and lend just the right degree of Distinction, the
final touch of ‘Refinement, that Hosiery should
provide.
Made in the very finest Pure Silk Thread possible of proouction,
scientifically shaped to give that perfect fitting from top to toe
necessary to Faultless style, available in a Range of Dainty Pastel
and Neutral Shades that provide a perfect match for fashionable
color-schemes, “Ladderproof” responds to every Hosiery
requirement of the woman to whom dressing is an art.
Despite its predominant suggestion of delicacy, Bond’s “Ladderproof”
is actually the HEAVIEST Pure Silk Hosiery that can be purchased,
and the period of flawless service that it invariably renders deserves
the term, “unique.”

CAN YOU DRAW?
You may think you can’t, but really
you can, for if you can write you can
draw; the same principles apply in
each. With the thorough tuition you
receive from the Weston Course, there
is no reason why you should not in-
stantly dash off free, bold sketches
similar to the one above.
THE HARRY J. WESTON
Postal School of Drawing
takes you step by step from the rudiments of
sketching to the highest branches of art.
The lessons are simple, interesting and effi-
cient.
Remember, we teach to DRAW not to COPY.
Learn more about the Course! Post three
stamps with your name and address, and you
will receive a copy of Mr. Weston’s interest-
ing Booklet —“There’s Money in the Pen”;
it explains all about the Course.

The Proof of this is at Harvest
Hundreds o! satisfied "Cletrac” owners
throughout the Commonwealth have been en
abled to produce abundant crops, owing to
their perfect seed-bed preparation and absence
of soil package. The same machine will strip
the crop in a minimum of time and expenditure,
assuring their owners against, bad weather and
other losses. Between seasons the Cletracs
have been put to 101 other uses on the farm.
All this means a saving of time, labor and
money. That is why we can truthfully say
“Cletrac” means more money in the Bank.

that seriously? And, incidentally, you are wrong
in your guess... .E.F.: Some day you may... . V.L.:
Mum is 14 stone —that is the principal interest in
your story. .. .R.H.W.: Even the basket yawned at
it....R.J.; Sorry to put more acid on 8i11....
N.A.R.: Does not strike g01d... .W.A.T.: The snow-
wtute innocence of Jim is not convincing... .J.C.G. •
Try still again. .. .H.G.8.: Nearly; but the conclusion
is rather too obvious. .. .Jack C.: The finale dis-
qualifies it.... Bess S.: Well written, but falls away
at the end. . . .C.H.R. (Q.) : Same to you. . . .G.T.D.:
Hardly; but don’t destroy. You should find a market
for it elsewhere J.J.A.: Regret we haven’t the
space... .J.J.D.; “Sufferin’ toads! Pull the blanky
trigger an’ get it over.” Pulled R.L.J.: The
curtain is down on “Greek Tragedy.” Everyone is
nicely killed P. J.G.: Old idea in tarnished set-
ting. . . .G.A.8.: As food for humor cats’ concerts and
cows’ customs are a bit stale... .S.L.: When made fit
for reading it will be read.... H.A.L.: Good luck to
the old lady, wherever she is. We won’t resurrect
her. ...L.J.: Melodramatic situation. With experi-
ence you could handle it better. . . .Namoi: Too slight.
. ...F.T.K.: Well written, but boils down to very
little... .R. 8.: Pretty love stories are thick as hand-
some men in this office. .. . L.8.L.: Sorry out of our
sphere. But very well t01d.... Boronia: Just misses.
..... J.F.H.: Misses... .Ixion: Misses by a mile....
S.C.G.: Pretty in a way, but gets to nothing Lily
B.: Has feeling, but not enough skill. .. .J.C. (Rock-
hampton) : They have a rich flavor of extreme an-
tiquity .... A.P.R.: Avoid that alphabetic stuff —it is
the trade-mark of a decaying intellect.... Bill Y.:
Once more we solemnly curse the importer of that
word “Wanderlust.” It has appeared at the head of
more thoroughly bad poems than any other....
Bellerive: Ah, there’s psychology here as well as
art:—
HOMEWARD BOUND FROM HOBART.
Aboard the cleaving steamer
Speedily tossing o’er the swell,
The passenger s did gather
When chimed the dinner-bell;
From potatoes, beef and pickles
And the splashing of the foam,
A friend of mine was bilious
While we were sailing home.
I gently led him to he’s bunk,
Where he cursed the rolling Deep,
And blurted “Bally nonsense!
How the devil can I sleep ! ”
Other voyagers suffered
From the malady of the foam,
were heaving to the fishes.
While we were sailing home.”'
. ...H.G.M.: You’ll have to produce something 100
per cent, better than that. .. .Mary S.: Not up....
D.V.W.: None have enough quality... .K.C.8.G.:
Loose, easy and imitative H.Y.W.: Highly moral,
very dreary and showing little 5ki11.... The Orphan:
They don’t strike u 5.... Gordon F.: Too little in
them... .N. de P.: Certainly. But stick tight to
the facts... .E.R.S.: Thanks; but the old chap has
“done the spitting” too often. .. .Velia E.: In this
space you haven’t made it convincing. But it’s
good groundwork for a n0ve1.... Arev: That bone’s
been chewed so often there isn’t so much as a wisp
of skin left on it... . Gladys S.; Good, homely note
which just misses a job with the orchestra....
R.W.T.; Has no charm and little meaning Bull’s
Wool; You haven’t the 5ki11.... P.C.C.; Neither of
them up... . Where Duty Leads: The verse is better
than the illegible signature, but can’t stay the dis-
tance. .. .P.L. (Bondi) : Both miss, but they grazed
the target. .. .J.M.N.; Not well enough done....
Dorothea T.: The verse goes heavily and gets to
nothing. .. .Rita C.: Not enough of either color or
force... .T.V.T.: Doesn’t strike :uis. ... J.T.M.:
Wooden... .L.M. (Gisborne): You have a lot of
things to learn; one of the first is that “stamp”
won’t rhyme with “scamps.”.... E.L.A.: Has tunc,
but little else.... Clyde C.: Too heavy and clumsy.
Seventeen: Don’t care for it... .L.0.J.: A statement
of that sort doesn’t call for rhyme. .. .Hoani C.:
The adverse opinion of a man who writes that sort
of verse is entirely a compliment.... Ripponlea: We
don’t mind telling you in confidence that in our
opinion many a worse sonnet has never been
written:—
Here did I make my mortal debut!
In yon cottage I came this world to begrace;
At night I generally recollect th’ place
Which at present decorates mine view.
How th’ milk-thistles are all besoaked in dew 1
And the old fowlhouse where the old rooster crew 1
In yonder woodshed with very eager face
I read tales very full of horror and glue 1
I do not doubt that mayhap I shall throw a seven ;
And no matter where I should throw it
I’ll sing from my position in Heaven, if any,
In enthusiastic epithets many
To my prospective associates in Heaven
Of th’ birthplace of th’ poet.
. ...H.J.G.: Wanted smarter handling. .. .W.8.M.:
Too crude. .. .W.J.M.: The verse stamps along
heavily to say the commonplace.... A.W.D.: Doesn’t
make us want to grab it and publish next week’s Bul-
letin a day in advance... .M.H.J.: Chopped prose....
W.W.L.S.: Verse of that sort is only for home con-
sumption. It says nothing except that you had a
pleasant holiday H.M. (Waverley): Doesn’t get
near... .Kathleen S.: That sort of loose descriptive
stuff has no chance... .P.E.S.: Not for u 5....
Bryan M.: “Heloise” doesn’t deserve the hard things
you say about her.. '. .Aruel: Too slight... .D.M.
(Dulwich Hill): It’s strange how you could write
so much and contrive to say so little. .. .S.C.G.:
Very poor Ellice L.: The first rule is: “Get
something to say”. ..-H.V.W.: Rough stuff with
little point F.W.D.: Old H.K.W.: “Madden-
ing doubt” justified C.M.: Not suitable A. 8.:
Crisply told, but not much to tell H.E.H.: Too
late; and it didn’t thrill us, anyway M.H.H.:
Fair; but hardly enough meat on its bones....
Hugh Josephs; Not enough skill in the telling
Alec W. : You don’t make your noints sharp enough.
H.I.J.: Sorry we haven’t the space W.D.F.,
The only fault about it is that we’ve had rather
too many with an Oriental setting lately.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
5.8. K.: You can’t persuade us there’s “real life”
like that on the Hawkesbury F.G.: That dodge of
hiding the hands puts you under grave suspicion....
8.P.: There’s promise in it. .. . G.1.W.: Economy of
line commended: but why the black faces? C.F.:
No advance in latest effort. .. .D’A.L.M.: More is
wanted than a mere likeness... .W.C.: He took a
colored copy for himself, did he? An easy-going
chap !... E.A.T.: Not quite bright enough—say, half
a candle-power short.

Ask this question
before you buy
your CHRISTMAS phonograph
Put a phonograph in your home this Christmas—it is the gift supreme, bringing with
it music, the world’s greatest tonic for mind and spirit.
But be sure the Phonograph you buy is one of true realism. Ask this question:
“Has this instrument been tested by actual comparison with living artists or instrumental-
ists?’’ The New Edison can confidently answer “Yes!” for it has emerged triumphantly
from over 6000 such public tests.
Its music is indeed the kind you want for your home.

“FY7”: Two ingenious birds were caged
in Brisbane recently and convicted of carry-
ing on a new method of plucking pigeons.
They named their eyrie the Tipit Photo
Studies. Photos of horses were printed for
60s. a thousand and sold for a bob each.
Points were given to buyers marking placed
horses on the backs of the photographs, and
the three largest aggregates collected first,
second and third prizes. Agents hawked the
photographs on an allowance of 3d., and
some 1500 were sold in the week the law
butted in. As prizes totalled only £27 10s.
a week, the margin of profit was pretty good.
* * * *
“Nitric”: The production of synthetic
sugar by Professor E. C. Baly, of Liverpool
Uni., ranks as one of the most important
discoveries in the history of chemistry. The
feat was lately demonstrated experimentally
at the 68tli convention of the American
Lnemical Society. Baly synthesised for-
maldehyde from carbon dioxide and
water; by exposing this to intensely
active ultra-violet rays sugar was produced.
At. the same time formaldehyde was pro-
duced by retransforming the sugar, thus com-
pleting the cycle. The remarkable discovery
cannot, however, be utilised commercially
yet, because, the proper wave-length of the
ultra-violet light has not been determined,
though its limits are definitely known.

“Verri” The Union Co.’s new steamer,
the Aorangi (Maori for Mt. Cook, the “cloud-
piercer”), the largest and fastest internal
combustion ship afloat, leaves on her maiden
voyage to Sydney about the end of December.
The voyage will occupy seven weeks; the
ship is to call at Jamaica, pass through the
Panama Canal, look in at Los Angeles and
San Francisco, and take up her time-table
at Vancouver, thence covering the usual
route via Honolulu and Suva to Auckland
and Sydney. The Aorangi is to carry the
M.L. mails, and is heavily subsidised by the
M.L. Government; the new contract time
is about 10 days, or two days faster than the
Niagara’s schedule. She is the last thing in
marine construction and comfort, and
although firemen and trimmer ratings are
dispensed with, her officers and crew will
run to about 230.
* * * *
“Two Seas”: The Victorian idea of a
Better Farming train, loaded up with ex-
perts who lecture the cockies on how to farm,
may sound all right; but what the average
cocky in N.S.W. wants to hear is how
lie can support his family upon the starvation
returns lie gets for his produce. I know one
of them, in a rich potato-growing district
down south, who recently sent a consignment
of spuds to Sydney. The agent returned him
the staggering sum of Is. lOd. per ton. Just
now there are acres of murphies rotting in
the paddocks because to pay for digging and
bagging them would result in a heavy
loss. Cocky is used to getting 'nothing
for his own labor; it is rather too much to
expect him to pay others award wages to
land him deeper in debt. The only hope for
the cocky is a good market near at hand, and
that means more factories in country towns.
* * * *
“Balaena”: While the Norwegians are
going to give whaling another run in the
Ross Sea this summer, the business has
touched bottom as far as Eastern Australia
is concerned. The Davidsons, of Twofold
Bay. where was the one surviving “bay”
whaling-station in the Commonwealth, have
abandoned the game for oyster leases, tree-
planting for the Government and other less
exciting pastimes; no whale has been caught
at Twofold this season. Yet at the end of
August scores could be seen by any vessel
coasting northward from Sydney, which
shows that numbers were migrating up from
the south. In Westralia a company, using
the modern liarpoon-gun and other up-to-
date equipment, has been doing a little whal-
ing at Point Cloates, near Sharks Bay. The
whales migrate up and down the coast there
as they do in the cast. But the Navigation
Act lias hit this company hard one way and
another. At one time it had a couple of
hundred tons of whale manure, which a pass-
ing British ship would have carried cheaply
to Fremantle, where it was wanted. But
the oversea boat was refused a permit to
carry it, and the coastal steamers asked too
high a price to leave any profit. In the end
it waited there till it could be shipped to
England.
THE CLERK’S HOLIDAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
This life is flat ar.d cheerless and like an endless
plain;
Day in, day out, from morn till night, we sing
the same old song.
The same old walls around us, our tasks return
again—
The same old tasks of rule and rote throughout tire
whole day long.
But at 5 p.m. I’ll leave them to seek a brighter star,
tor I’m going off to-morrow where the grey peaks
are.
The grey peaks, the clear peaks, the peaks that
pierce the sky,
With mountain winds a-singing and the trees’ soft
sigh !
I’ll leave my pen and ledgers, and climb the heights
afar,
For I’m wandering to-morrow where the grey peaks
are.
There’s a haunted, shaded gully where the mossy
banks are green
With tangled musk and dogwood and a million
dancing leaves ;
And through the patterned canopy of trees the blue
serene
Of a southern heaven peeps across the lattice that
it weaves.
And to-morrow I shall reign there, like an undis-
puted czar,
For I’m going off to-morrow where the grey peaks
are.
The grey peaks, thq glad peaks, happy in the glow
Of crystal skies above them and the green hills below!
Now Yopth has conie to me again; there’s nothing
now to mar
My tramp away to-morrow where the grey peaks are.
VICTOHIA.

P.S.C. 2s
J. B. Thomson, the Baynton squatter
(Vic.) and friend of abos. in the early days,
left a little pile of £65,000 to his grown-up
family.
Died recently at Mildura (Vic.), O. C.
Witherden, for many years Government
Assayer at Darwin. He went to the N.T.
in 1889, and after over 30 years’ service
was retrenched a few years back. Pneu-
monia carried him off. Ilis widow is a
daughter of the first Mayor of Wentworth
(N.S.W.).
Went west the other day, Dick Fitzpatrick,
better known in the N.S.W. backblocks .as
Seventy-Mile Dick. A hard toiler all his life,
he struck Tatt.’s for £6OO some years ago,
and realised the ambition of his life by buy-
ing a bullock-team. The first load of wool
broke him, for he struck, bad weather, and
it took him nearly four months to get from
Mount Brown to Wilcannia.
Passed out in a Blue Mountain sana-
torium, in his early thirties, Frank Harti-
gan, alumnus of the Cardinal’s College,
Manly, and good Australian. He was a
younger brother of “John O’Brien,” the Nar-
randera priest who wrote “Round the
P«oree Log,” and was himself a writer of
verse considerably above the average.
W. Judd, M.A., whose tutorial work in
Northern Tas. for the W.E.A. of the Speck’s
little University has been earning high en-
comiums for a couple of years past, is
spoken of as a probable Labor candidate
at next elections. Parliament having ukased
that the W.E.A. shall cease operations early
in 1825, he will be looking for something
to do.
The Australian Historical Society, which
doesn’t get the limelight it deserves, lost one
of its most enthusiastic members recently
when A. G. Foster died, after a long illness,
at 64. A busy departmental manager for a
big city firm, he yet found time to write
many pamphlets dealing with Sydney’s early
history. His specialty was the Phillip
period.
James Green, who died at 76 the other
day, was the son of the first man to run a
mail between Sydney and Melbourne. He
was educated at Brisbane Grammar, and
was in the Bank of N.S.W. at Wangaratta
till he became a drover and station-manager.
In later years he ran a big stock-and-
station agency in Charleville (Q.), where
he died.
“Nikko”: Mariners who frequently have
the nerve-wracking experience of trying to
pick up the Three Kings in fog or darkness
will be glad to learn that the M.L. Govern-
ment has decided to instal a modem
radio beacon there. As the Kings are usu-
ally shrouded in heavy fog lights would be
valueless when most required, and fog sig-
nals are apt to be deceptive as regards dis-
tance and direction.
Hobart softgoodsman W. M. Williams, w T ho
left £53,000 when he died a few weeks ago,
remembered his beloved Melville-street
Methodist Church to the tune of £5OO and
Foreign Missions for £lOOO. Hobart Hospi-
tal Board and Tas. Public Library Board,
both of which the old man had chaired for
years, got nothing: the remainder goes to
a couple of daughters with provision for
the widow, a third wife.
Since the retirement of the Rev. Bern-
stein from the Adelaide Hebrew Congrega-
tion, the Rev. S. M. Solomon, of the Bourke-
street Synagogue, Melbourne, is the only
Australian-born Jewish minister in Aus-
tralia ; and as he has officiated for 40 years
he must be one of the oldest. Jewish con-
gregations set large store upon diplomas
that can’t be obtained in this part of the
world, but Solomon’s prestige has pros-
pered in spite of that.
“Lao-dah”: The fifty-four days’ voyage
of the scow Cathkit from Tasmania to Syd-
ney the other day was beaten as a record by
an American barque which started out dur-
ing the war to sail from Hobart to Bunbury
(AV.A.). After beating against head winds
for weeks in Bass Strait, the skipper decided
the long way round was the shorter, and
actually turned his ship about and ran
before the gale clean round the globe, reach-
ing Bunbury from the opposite direction.
A Melbourne citizen had a close shave
of being run in for insulting behavior a
few mornings ago. Interviewed by a police-
man and asked his name as witness to a
motor accident, he merely said “ ’Ell.” The
J. Hop showed a natural annoyance, which
was accentuated when a further stern de-
mand elicited a stolid “Just ’Ell.” But
papers in the man’s pocket effectively cleared
him from the imputation of being a contu-
macious dropper of aspirates. His name was
David Ell.
From a Tasmanian hopgrower:—
The present position of the hop-grower is as stated
in. Tiie Bulletin of Oct. 2—he finds himself with a
great deal of produce he cannot find a local market
for. But the Tas. Hopgrowers’ Pool, Ltd., wasn't
guilty of the things charged. It didn’t run up the
price in 1921 to “Bs. and even 10s. per lb.” In 1920
the highest price the Pool" got was Ss. 9d. and in
1921 3s 6d. per lb., and that for comparatively small
quantities: the bulk was sold under contract at prices
which netted the grower Is. Bd. to 2s. Alas, it
wasn’t the grower who benefited by the higher
prices mentioned in the paragraph.
“A.J.D.”: The clay from Sydney Cove
which provided the original Josiah Wedg-
wood with material for a medallion (B.
23/10/’24) was brought to him by Sir
Joseph Banks, to whom he presented the
finished article. This medallion is now one
of the treasured possessions of the Mitchell
Library. It is chocolate brown in color,
Wedgwood having added some manganese to
the (day. There is also in the library a
medallion of the same date, in blue and white
Wedgwood ware, known as the Etruria
Medallion, with a copy of Wedgwood’s
chemical investigation into the composition
of the clay and liis opinion on its suitability
for pottery manufacture.
“Coot” : Whilst attendant at the Working
Men’s College, Melbourne, Frank Anstey
didn’t confine his energies to sweeping class-
rooms and climbing flagpoles (B. 30/10/’24).
The College students had a flourishing debat-
ing society, and it was here that Anstey
scored his initial successes as a speaker. His
work often prevented him from arriving at
the meeting until late, but I can remember
the whispered “Here’s Anstey” which his
arrival always occasioned. We knew that
whatever the subject was he would be well
worth listening to.

method means to you and

Why Not You?
Those people who show white teeth combat
that dingy film
Will you accept this offer which millions
have accepted ? Try this new way of
teeth cleaning. Watch the new beauty, the
new charm that comes. The new sense of
safety and cleanliness.
Wherever you cok you now see the
results. Learn how to bring them to the
people in your home.
Always a film
You can feel a film on teeth—a viscous
film. No old brushing method effectively
combats it. Much of it clings and stays.
Food stains, etc., discolor it, then it
forms dingy coats. That is how teeth lose
their beauty.
Film also holds food substance which
ferments and forms acid. It holds the
acid in contact with the teeth to cause decay.
Germs breed by millions in it. They, with
tartar, are the chief cause of pyorrhea.
Hardly one in fifty escapes such troubles
under old ways of teeth cleaning.
Modern science has found ways to fight
that film. One disintegrates the film at all
stages of formation. One removes it with-
out harmful scouring.
Many clinical tests proved these methods
efficient. A new-type tooth paste has been
created to apply them daily. The name is
Pepsodent.
Leading dentists everywhere began to
advise it. Now it has brought a new dental
era to millions the world over.
PROTECT THE ENAMEL
Pepsodent disintegrates the film,
then removes it with an agent far
softer than enamel. Never use a film
combatant which contains harsh grit.
See what it does
Some of the results are visible and quick.
But others are also essential.
Pepsodent multiplies the tooth-protect-
ing agents in the mouth. One of them—
in the saliva —digests starch deposits on
teeth. One is there to neutralize mouth
acids. Pepsodent gives to both of them a
multiplied effect.
All the best that research has discovered
is embodied in this method.
Send the form for a io-Day Tube.
Note how clean the teeth feel after using.
Mark the absence of the viscous film. See
how teeth become whiter as the film-coats
disappear.
You have never dreamed that such re-
sults could come from any tooth paste.

Ladders.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I NEVER see a ladder leaning up
Against the mellow redness of a wall,
But Fancy at my mouth sets memory’s
cup;
Dreams or realities I can recall
Of ladders made of twig and flower and vine
Spun spider-wise across this world of mine.
Great ropes of creeper swinging down a rock,
Tall basalt pillars not so long grown cool,
The clinging hands, the swift descending
shock,
The broken leaves that starred the yellow
pool,
Scent of bruised sprig, and bud and ripped
green bark—
Or else a sudden slip and then the dark.
Mayhap a ladder saved my life one night.
When powder burned and there were rush-
ing feet
And smoking torches to the moon’s sleek
white,
A ladder helped me downward to the street,
Leaving the lighted room, the fiery cup,
Till some black alley swallowed danger up.
Perchance ancestral-recollection spins
A silken ladder dangling on a wall,
With powder of blown bergamot o’er sins
That were well worth the sinning, after
all.
With silver ladies laughing from a shroud —
Blood of old Venice, amorous and proud!
A ladder made of spears and knotted cord
That swayed from unlit turrets on the air;
A gentleman-at-arms, to save his lord,
Set broken blade across the narrow stair.
Then the wild geese that flecked the autumn
sky
Saw fools go free and unsung heroes die.
A ladder looking o’er a padlocked gate,
The rind-brown trunks of trees, the blos-
som snow.
Foaming green runnels in a springtide spate
To hide the trails where secret lovers go.
Against her cherry mouth he makes liis
suit.
Oh, never orchard yielded fairer fruit!
A ladder to the hayloft. There among
The dust-of-grass one ray of light has
found
A king’s man who is rufous-loeked and
young;
And while Noll’s troopers scour the farm-
side round
He sleeps as quiet as the lonely dead,
A hundred crowns upon his careless head!
A ladder to a black shaft, smooth and sheer,
An oubliette cut in a rocky hill.
Above, a ribald chorus, but, flung here,
Something that writhes and moans and
then is still.
They draw the ladder up. The stone will
hide
The deed a monarch planned to save his
pride.
Stringing her pearls about her pulsing throat
High in, her sunset tower, the Queen will
wait,
Dreaming an oar upon the weedy moat,
A rose betwixt the barriers of a gate,
A scarlet ribbon on a moth-grey lawn....
And she may wait, from candle-light till
dawn!
And into manydda r ns ! Fearful to speak
The torture of those long, uncertain hours
That groove a hollow in her ivory cheek,
And set a thorn among the favorite
flowers
Her lord sends daily. Where the lover fell
A stubborn rock can keep king’s secrets well.
A ladder to a hoarding set. A man
With splashing brush and rolls of paper,
bright
In gaudy picture. Eager eyes that scan
Have learned the circus will be here to-
night !
Lion and elephant! The ladder seems
An invitation to a land of dreams.
A ring of bell-tents on the dry reserve,
An Arab pony prancing through the town,
Man-eating tigers through the flame-rings
swerve
And leave unmoved the chalk-face of the
clown.
Straight ladders in the urchin’s mind are
bent
To hopes of creeping underneath the tent!
Life is a ladder—every day a rung
To clamber up or slide back fast —and so
Building on songs that dead men’s lips have
sung
How much we add to it we cannot know.
Ike ladder of a life that leads to you
Makes all sweet songs men ever sang come
true!
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
The Point of View.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
"IVT* OTHING in this kaleidoscopic life of
ours is more remarkable than the
singularly diverse fashion in which
a simple fact or happening represents itself
to the minds of different people. A meets
K, and smites him upon the nose. It is a
plain and uncomplicated event, seemingly in-
capable of distortion. There was A, there
was B. Tlie clenched fist of A made violent
contact witli the olfactory organ appertaining
to B. Thajt is all that is to be said in
truth and vrerity. Yet the incident will be-
come history in a score of ways. A’s view-
point aiwl B’s will, of course, differ; but so
also wilh those of C, D, E, F, G —until we
come to 'the tradition of Z. Why this should
be so rco one knows for certain, but it may
be preajjumedi that the fact that no two finger-
prints have yet been found to correspond
may have some bearing upon the subject.
The individual is always unalterably the
individual. The true socialist does not exist.
The case of the brothers Laverty and the
frail sisters Dightman may fittingly be cited
as an illustration of what is printed above,
with the differing estimation of it by O
(Governor Macquarie) and of Z (the com-
mon hangman of the day, Mr. John Bar-
tholomew). Here is his Excellency’s, as ex-
pressed in a Government and General Order
dated Wednesday, February 27, 1811: —
His Excellency the Governor and Commander-in-
Chief deeply laments the melancholy necessity which
has this day obliged him to exhibit to the inhabi-
tants of the colony, in the death of the two
miserable young men who. this morning suffered the
sentence of the law, so awful a warning of the
inevitable consequences which attend a long con-
tinuance in habits of vice and irregularity.
The almost unexampled depravity of these two
culprits, and their repeated and desperate offences,
rendered it a bounden, though very painful, duty in
the part of his Excellency no longer to allow them
to continue members of that society whose laws
they were continually and wantonly violating, and
to which they were at once a terror and reproach ;
but to cut them off at that early period of life
which in general encourages the hope of continued
utility, and excites the strongest sympathies of
humanity.
His Excellency, however, trusts that a duty, the
performance of which has been so painful to him,
will not be without its salutary effects upon the
public, and more particularly upon those unhappy
but culpable individuals who would ere this have
paid the forfeit of their lives to the offended laws
of their country had not his Excellency been pleased
to extend the Royal mercy to them.
With rcs-ard to one of these unfortunate persons,
his Excellency may observe that the crime of
forgery, of which he was convicted, is one most
highlv prejudicial to the interests of society, as
it strikes at the root of all commercial credit and
confidence ; is committed with facility, but is not
without much difficulty either repressed or detected :
and that his Excellency is therefore determined to
punish any future offender convicted of a similar
crime with the utmost severity of the law'.
With respect to the two unfortunate women to
whom the mercy of the Crown has been extended,
his Excellency has to remark that their sex cannot
be allowed to be an excuse for guilt ; and that,
though mercy may sometimes be held out to the
criminal, it cannot be suffered to interfere with that
protection which is justly due to the virtuous and
industrious part of society.
His Excellency indulges the hope that the occur-
rence of to-day may reclaim those who are yet young
in vice; and’that during his future administration
he may’ be spared the recurrence of a duty which
nothing but considerations of the most important
nature could enable him to perform.
And this is what Mr. Bartholemew said
about it the same evening in the taproom of
the Spotted Dog, conducted by Mr. Timothy
Naylan, on his premises, opposite the gaol
in Lower George-street. lie addressed the
company generally during a somewhat lieated_
debate as to the merits and shortcomings of
the two young gentlemen to whom he had
attended professionally in the morning.
Amongst the diversity of those present there
were held as many dissimilar views on the
subject as there were types of citizenry in
the room. The only unanimity noticeable
was a feeling that the matter could not be
adequately considered without the consump-
tion of a large quantity of Mr. Naylan’s
Bengal rum.
“Look ye now, gemmen all,” said Mr.
Bartholemew, waving the stem of his church-
warden pipe comprehensively round the com-
pany, “ ’arf a moment —hif.you pleases. \\ ot
I says is this: ’twas a shame them two
young codgers ever come into my ’ands at
all. I didn’t ’old wi’ punisliin’ them two,
though I done ’em in well an’ trooly, accord-
in’ to me ’abit. Them Lavertys was in-
jured mortals, so they was. An’ them two
young wenches —why, they’re a credit to
society, so they is, for not a-squealin’. Gawd
bless ’em all, says I, livin’ an’ dead. Wot
th’ Gov’nor says ’ere in th’ Gazette is
skitters. If I’d bin Mister Macquarie neither
Jimmy nor Johnny would ha’ bin scragged
this marnin’. An’'them two pretty an’ liin-
nercent dears would not ha’ bin sent off to
tlr Coal River, so they wouldn’t. ’Tis a
shime, that ’ere!”
If these two ends of the executive—the
Governor and the hangman—could differ so
widely, the many and various views of Syd-
ney’s humbler inhabitants might easily be
strangely divergent. However, let us come
to the facts.
# * * *
Peter Laverty, the elder of the two young
men whom Mr. Bartholemew assisted into
the next world, had received a good educa-
tion. His brother, Denis, was an illiterate.
Peter had been noticed in his childhood by
that excellent man Father John Delaney,
parish priest of the hamlet of Ballymead,
Cos. Cork, to be a singularly bright and in-
telligent little fellow, full of personality and
persuasiveness, and endowed with other quali-
ties that raised him unaccountably above the
dull average of his youthful contemporaries
in the primitive community of which lie was
a part. It became the good man’s aim in
life to prepare this bright boy for the Church.
He would make the ideal peasant priest in
the commonwealth of peasantry which the
Rev. John Delaney held to be the true con-
ception of Irish nationhood. Nothing that
he could do would be spared to advance this
hopeful lad, whose every childish character-
istic gave promise of a development into man-
hood that would place him infinitely above
the level of his progenitors, both mentally
and morally.
“But I do be suspectin’,” the good clergy-
man has been heard to say on more than one
occasion, “that young Peter, as a matter o’
breedin’, is too good to be thrue! However,
we’ll not look gift janiuses in the mouth.”
Denis, on tbe other hand, was no more
than a pugnacious young rapscallion, with
hardly enough understanding of the facts of
existence to come in out of the wet. possessed
of several uproarious devils eternally steering
him into mischief, and as full of folly as an
egg is of yolk.
“Th’ young blaggard’ll stretch a rope afore
he’s five-and-twinty,” was Father Delaney’s
opinion of him. “He might as well have been
borrun a blunderin’ Prot’stant for all th’
good that’s in him. Well, well, Peter must
take care of him ; ’tis all there’s for it.”
In the year ISO 2, at the age of 18, Peter
Laverty decided not to be a cardinal, which
was Father Delaney’s ultimate design for
him, but to adopt the status of a gentleman
of means. In furtherance of this project
he practised a short apprenticeship to the
calling of a highwayman, enlisting his
brother Denis as his assistant. It was a very
brief career that was vouchsafed them, for
they had not pursued it three months when
(Continued on next page.)


A TREACHEROUS TROUBLE
Kidney diseases are very dangerous. They come on
silently, gain ground rapidly, and cause thousands of
deaths that could have been prevented by proper
treatment in the beginning. Nature gives early
warnings of kidney disease —backache, twinges of
pain when stooping or lifting, headaches or urinary
disorders. If these symptoms are unheeded there is
grave danger of fatal kidney disease. Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills have earned a reputation for
their effectiveness in kidney trouble and are known
and recommended the world over.

EXPERIENCES OF SYDNEY PEOPLE.
Mr. Lewis Williams, 602 Botany Road, Botany, Sydney, says :—“I was
a great sufferer with my back and the pain was at times so bad that I had
to leave my work and go home. I was bent almost double and could not
stand up straight without increased suffering. I used various preparations,
but only got slight relief. Reading of cures effected by Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills, I decided to try them. One bottle eased the pain and the
second completed my cure. This did not happen yesterday, but about two
years ago, and I have had no sign of backache all that time, so it is not
mere temporary relief, but a perfect cure. lam always advising my friends
to use Dean’s Backache Kidney Pills, and am glad to have an opportunity
to publicly recommend them.”
Twelve years later Mrs. Williams says:—“My husband is still well
and has tyeen free of backache since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured him
14 years iago.”
Mrs. W. Sullivan, 61 Kellick Street, Waterloo, Sydney, says:—“l
suffered terribly with my kidneys for some time. I had terrible pains in
my back and could hardly move without suffering torture. I was also subject
to bad headaches, dizzy feelings, and had urinary trouble, the secretions being
thick and cloudy and difficult to pass. Nothing I took seemed to suit my
case, and I suffered on in spite of treatment; but at last I got a good remedy,
and that was Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. A friend advised me to take
a course of these Pills, which I did, and I am pleased to say they cured
me of every distressing symptom mentioned. I used 10 bottles in all, and
my cure is perfect, for I have been as right as rain for the last 12 months.”
Ten years later Mrs. Sullivan says:—“Doan's Backache Kidney Pills
cured me of backache and kidney trouble 11 years ago, and I am still well.
I always keep this remedy by me and take a dose or so now and then, just
as a help to the kidneys.”

the brother's found themselves cast for death
at the Cork Assizes, on a charge of attempted
robbery under arms of the Dublin mail. How-
ever, their youth saved them for the time
being from the hangman’s rope, and they
came to Sydney in 1803, during the govern-
ment of Captain King. Eight years later
they were, as we have seen, to provide occa-
sion for Governor Macquarie’s melancholy
homily, and to enlist the generous sympathy
of the broadminded master-gallowsman who
put them to death.
Denis Laverty continued in the road-mak-
ing industry with gyves about liis ankles for
some time after his better-endowed elder
brother had achieved a position in the im-
portant department administered by Mr.
John Palmer, Commissary-General, where he
speedily came to be looked upon as invalu-
able and indispensable. Whilst Denis was
hiding in hollow logs and ferny gullies in
the hinterland of Castle Hill, after the abor-
tive rebellion of the Irish prisoners at the
beginning of ISO 4, Peter was averting his
proscription through the good offices of the
Commissary with the Governor himself.
“Well, well, Mr. Palmer.” protested Cap-
tain King, “you say the brother’s a good
man. But, damme, what’s that matter! If
we take and hang the fellow he’ll be rid of
an awkward encumbrance, won’t he? They
tell me this Denis Laverty was prominent
at the flogging of the flagellator, when the
croppies caught the unfortunate man at the
stockade. Better dead, I say—like all these
Irish ! Never knew one yet that wasn’t better
dead than alive. However,” he grumbled,
“if you make a personal matter of it, have
it your own way. Get his brother to make
him surrender himself, and then I’ll assign
him to you and hold you answerable for his
good behavior. You can employ him on your
farm at Wallamoula —and I wish you joy
of the infernal scoundrel!”
So Denis came to work in the orchard at
the head of Palmer’s Cove, and lived with
his brother in the comfortable hut which had
been assigned to his confidential clerk by the
kindly Commissary—somewhere about the
present intersection of William and Biley
streets.
The sisters Dightman, flaxen and fair and
frail, constituted one of the marvels of early
Sydney. twins, and so exactly
similar in appearance as to be almost indis-
tinguishable. It was said that they were
only able to establish an individuality be-
tween themselves because Polly had a mole
on her waistline which was lacking to
Martha. In character, tastes, thought and
inclination they were as alike as in appear-
ance. They ate the same food, wore similar
clothing, sinned with the same man, and
were awake and asleep at the same time.
They had been convicted of shoplifting in
company in Cheapside. had looked forward
for a while to the same end outside New-
gate. and had been transported, instead, for
similar terms of fourteen years. On the
voyage to Port Jackson they had shared the
protection and the cabin of the master of
the transport, Lady Josephine. Here, in
Sydney, they had simultaneously, after the
pleasing fashion of the period, become “house-
keeper” to Mr. Isaac Sparrow. Master Ship-
wright, at the Government Dockyard in Syd-
ney Cove. It was upon the lamented death
of this protector that they had cast in their
lot with the brothers Laverty, going to live
with them in the little wattle-and-slab domi-
cile in the bush about Woolloomooloo.
The details of that strange alliance may
hardly be discussed delicately. It must
suffice to say that the marriage sacrament
was not involved in the matter, and that
the two brothers were never quite sure as
to which of the pretty pair belonged to each.
Many strange things happened in Sydney in
those days when one of the most unusual
conditions was lawful wedlock; but there
was nothing quite so queer as obtained in
the little household behind Mr. Palmer’s big
white cottage. However, it was nobody’s
business, and nobody was put out about it.
It was noted that the Laverty household was
a singularly happy one for that rather un-
happy community—well fed, well clothed and
well content, and more often in a position to
be pleasantly inebriated together than were
many of its less fortunate neighbors. But
they were a generous and hospitable quar-
tette, and neither envy nor malice detracted
from their popularity. People went to see
the Twins as a sort of instituted diversion,
and many were the jests, mainly unprintable,
to which their situation gave origin.
But this happy communistic establishment
was not permitted by the inscrutable gods
to prolong its existence down the years. Mrs.
Palmer noted one Sunday that the sisters
were clad in blue silk dresses of exactly simi-
lar color, texture and ornamentation as the
one which she herself was wearing.
“They must be, my dear Mr. Palmer,” she
said. “ ’Tis impossible to explain the matter
otherwise.”
“But, my dear,” replied the Commissary
doubtfully—“ Peter Laverty! Why, I’d
sooner suppose his Excellency had robbed the
Customs than this good fellow. ’Tis incred-
ible, I tell you !”
“Maybe,” said the lady inexorably, “but
inevitable. You import for me a case con-
taining three silk dresses of the same sort
from Hodgkinson’s on Ludgate Hill. Two of
them are removed from the package whilst
it is lying in the Stores. What is to be sup-
posed? Why, your Peter Laverty is not all
that you imagine him to be. Investigation,
my dear Jack, must be made. Most certainly
it must!”
It was; and an amazing tale of robbery,
the forging of orders upon the storekeepers
and embezzlement was disclosed. So circum-
stantial and convincing was it that no doubt
was possible when the Criminal Court came
to try the brothers Laverty and the sisters
Dightman upon a series of charges as long
as it was serious. Conviction and sentence
were inevitable. Sentimentalists and con-
noisseurs of the curious might regret the
passing out of existence of this happy house-
hold, but there was no help for it. It had
to be passed out.
Had it not been for Mrs. Macquarie there
can be little doubt that both Martha and
Polly would have shared the fate of their
men. But that gentle lady, all sympathy and
sorrow and kindness to the unfortunate and
misguided girls, could not bear the thought
that the pretty twins should decorate a
gibbet. She had hopes, perhaps, of effecting
a reformation, and of seeing them one day
happily disposed of in lawful matrimony,
now that those whom she supposed to be their
seducers were to be removed from their way
in life. So she begged and shed piteous
tears until her stern lord gave way, to the
extent of omitting their names from the
death-warrant which he was signing. This
much achieved, she knew well enough that it
would be only a question of time when she
might ask a pardon fo* them, and begin the
blessed task of regeneration. She requested
that they might be brought across from the
gaol to Government House, so that she her-
self might inform her errant sisters of the
mercy that had been extended to them, and
so begin the good work.
As the sun was setting redly behind the
Bocks, the pretty pair, demure and down-
cast, were ushered into the drawing-room
where their gentle benefactress awaited
them. At her request they seated themselves,
whilst Mrs. Macquarie regarded their extra-
ordinary similarity to one another with won-
der and curiosity. Suddenly she noticed that
they were handcuffed, and sprang to her feet
in hot anger.
“Oh, hateful!” she exclaimed, whilst the
girls stared at her out of their identical blue
eyes, the same degree of mild astonishment
registering itself upon their identical coun-
tenances.
“Constable — constable!” cried Mrs. Mac-
quarie. “Come in here, instantly, and remove
these fetters. What infamy! These two
helpless creatures. Take them off at once.
Did you put them on?”
The abashed and startled constable stam-
mered his excuses. “Werry sorry, ma’am,
th’ gaoler’s orders. These’ ere dames is
dang’rous. No offence, ma’am, I ’opes,” he
said, as he unlocked the bracelets in turn.
“That will do, sir. ’Tis most barbarous.
Please to wait on the verandah.” She turned
to the twins. “Now, my dears, pray calm
your apprehensions. My dear husband is well
disposed toward you both. You are not to
suffer with your—er —your companions. Oh,
I pray you to give thanks to the good God
for his great mercy. My poor dear girls, my
poor wee bairns! Oh, but I thank God —I
do indeed!”
Her emotion overcame her momentarily,
and two tears rolled down her sweet face.
The “wee bairns” stared at her stolidly, then
turned to look at one another, and smiled
an identical little smile of gratification.
Together they bowed their pretty heads, and
uttered their thanks in the same tone of
respectful relief.
“Oh, thankee kindly, ma’am,” said Polly,
feeling her slim neck with her pretty right
hand.
“Oh, thankee kindly, ma’am,” said Martha,
feeling her slim neck with her pretty right
hand.
“I am sorry to say,” went on Mrs. Mac-
quarie, “that your—er- —your companions are
to suffer.”
The shapely heads bowed themselves in a
similar expression of grief, and the same
choking sob heaved each curving bosom. Mrs.
Macquarie'looked at them sympathetically for
a few moments, refraining from further con-
versation until their first transports of sorrow
should be tempered by resignation. Pre-
sently she spoke again.
“Fray tell me,” she said softly, “you are
so marvellously alike—which of you is
Martha Dightman, and which Polly?”
They replied together: “If ye please,
ma’am, I be Polly.” “If ye please, ma’am,
I be Martha.”
With some difficulty Mrs. Macquarie de-
cided the one on the right to be Polly, the
other Martha. She addressed the former.
“Tell me, then, Polly, my dear—pray do
not be shy, lam a married woman —which of
these poor fellows is your —your man?”
The lovely Polly gazed at her with some-
thing of bewilderment, for a moment or two,
before she found her tongue.
“If ye please, ma’am —I dunno. Th’ both
of ’em!”
Mrs. Macquarie’s eyes opened wide with
amazement.
“Oh, gracious me!” she gasped. “What
—how—good Heavens !”
She turned to Martha. Came the same
answer.
“If ye please, ma’am—-I dunno. Tli’ both
of ’em!”
Hastily, and in some confusion, the scan-
dalised lady rose to her feet.
“I—ah —l do not know what to think.
There, there —my poor lasses! You must
come and see me again. Some other time,
pray. Go with the constable now. I will
send for you again.”
The girls stood up, hesitatingly, as though
they had something to ask.
“Yes, yes—my dears. Pray what is it?”
“If ’ee please, ma’am —may we see ’em
stretched?” asked Martha.
“If ’ee please, ma’am —may we see ’em
stretched?” requested Polly.
“Oh, horrible — horrible!” exclaimed the
overwrought lady, as she fled from the room.
“Oh, Heaven pity them!” she sobbed, as she
groped her way down the passage to her
husband’s office.

“And so I says,” concluded Mr. Bar-
tholomew. addressing the company at the
Spotted Dog, as has been mentioned, on the
evening of the execution —“wot I says is
this. ’Twas a pretty romance that there —
like a story wot corned out of a book. Wives
they was to both of ’em. fair and impartial.
None but a sour Scotchman like Mac-
quarie could ha’ had th’ heart for to step in
an’ spoil sich a arrangement. They all loved
one another, wi’ no preference. ‘Are ye quite
comfortable, Peter?’ I arxes ’im, as I tight-
ened th’ rope around his neck. ‘Quite, I
thankee, Jack,’ he says; ‘but ’tis ’ard to
leave them two darlin’ crayclmres.’ ‘Are
ye all right, Dinny?’ I puts it to the other
covey, as I ties ’is necktie. ‘Aw, git on wi’
th’ job, blast ye,’ says he. ‘ ’Tis on’y lavin'
thim two I gives a dam’ for,’ he says. Now
I puts it to ye, gemmenaalas this man
Macquarie got hany ’uman kindness what-
somever for to go an’ spile a pretty romance
like o’ that. Damme, no, I says—not th’
’umanness of a cold-blooded snake, ’e ain’t!
Damme if ’e ’as!”

individual features of many other keys,
so does Shell combine all the points
of superiority found in Motor Spirit.
Nature herself has made Shell

more uniform, and more perfectly combustible
than any other Motor Spirit in the World.
And the vast Shell organisation is the Master
Key which has unlocked these superior forces
of Nature for the use of every Motorist.
