FITZGERALD ON CHINA
Flood Tide in China (Cresset), a very
well-written book by Professor C. P.
Fitzgerald of the National University
at Canberra is the result of a short
tour with an Australian cultural dele-
gation in 1956, when, on the invitation
of the Chinese Government, the author
renewed his long acquaintance with
the country and its history.
At first, though later Professor
Fitzgerald is to be very touching on
the efficiency of the modern railways,
astonishing on the new cleanliness of
China and faintly disconcerting on its
morality, one misses the personal touch
in his book: what he did, what he saw.
But soon it becomes apparent that one
is getting rather more than that: a
distillation, an analysis of what he saw
and of what he has known for years by
a writer who takes the long view of an
historian:—
A student of history, viewing
these characteristics of ages of faith
and fanaticism as they slowly
modify their violence, will quickly
perceive that all the froth and fury
is not nothing but meaningless
verbiage. Beneath it,* expressing
itself thus crudely in its early stage,
a new Belief has grown. Round this
Belief a new form of society begins
to crystallise, expelling the undigest-
ible parts of the old society with
purges, heresy hunts, massacre and
the stake. Historically what matters
is not whether the Belief is false or
true, philosophically sound or
logically full of flaws, but whether
it is accepted by millions of men
in a great community. If this comes
about, whether they are deluded or
enlightened, the new faith will move
the mountains of old convention and
long-established social structure. It
is not what men believe that decides
the movement of history, it is the
fact that they believe.
From this height, looking upon the
problems of our own time as if they
were the problems that bothered
Augustus, Fitzgerald is able fo take a
singularly cool and soothing view of
the Communist State, at least in China:
where conditions, he insists, are very
different from in Europe ... or in
Australia. He sees militant Communist
and Capitalist as very similar to mili-
tant Moslem and Christian in the days
of the Crusades, and also to militant
Protestant and Catholic in the period
of the Thirty Years’ War; and he waits
with tranquillity for time, trade and
“military stalemate” to lead to “the
slow subsidence of the passionate
hatreds of the Age of Faith”: —
It is impossible for a historian to
doubt that this sequence must one
day succeed to the present age of
fanaticism, which we call the Cold
War. It is indeed quite probable that
with the faster tempo of modern life
the process will be accelerated.
Already it is widely believed that the
Great Final War to extirpate Com-
munism or Capitalism will not
eventuate . . .
But it would be misleading to convey
the impression that Fitzgerald views
the near future altogether without dis-
quiet. He says that the Chinese have
set-up a “dynamism” which may take
them further than perhaps they want
to go; and this qualifies his optimism
not only on world-affairs but also on
the specific question of Australia's
future: —
Southward of China, beyond the
sea, but yet linked to Asia by the
long chain of the Indonesian archi-
pelago, lies Australia, haunted by a
traditional fear of “Asian hordes”
ready to swarm into that empty
land. The fear is probably largely
imaginary and in the popular form
unreal. Most of Australia is a land
singularly ill-adapted to the farming
techniques of the Asian peasant....
The real prospect is... .a pressure to
conform in matters of trade and
foreign policy with the desires of
China rather than to provoke the
hostility of a most powerful neighbor.
Only a few years ago such a situa-
tion would have seemed fanciful and
wildly improbable ; it was Japan, the
naval Power, perhaps once more
militant, that roused Australian
alarm. There was as yet no realisa-
tion that China was a possible com-
petitor for the dominance of East
Asia left vacant by the fall of the
Japanese Empire, nor is it yet
certain that the full significance of
China’s revival has been measured
and a policy designed to meet the
new age. What is certain is, that the
pace of Chinese development and
reorganisation leaves little scope for "
procrastination.
China has unleashed energies and
enthusiasms which the Communist
party seeks to guide towards the
realisation of its own programme,
but which are themselves so dynamic
that their ultimate consequences
cannot be foreseen.
There remains the question: what
is it like in Red China today? Pro-
fessor Fitzgerald, when he reports
upon everyday reality, remains rather
abstract, as if he were moving through
a beautiful, clinical vacuum. He is
like a doctor inspecting a large, clean,
modern hospital; hardly noticing,
except with the faintest wrinkle of dis-
taste, anything nasty under the bed.
What is it really like, for instance, in
the New Workers’ Quarters in
Shanghai, where “The Western visitor
quickly realises that this new accomo-
dation represents at best the very
minimum which he would expect to
find in a temporary transit camp for
refugees”?
But still, if it is mostly in such vague
and’soothing terms, he does make his
report; and it is full of interest. He
says that there is no sign of a rule of
terror to be observed. Some 50,000
people were indeed put to death for
“treasonable acts,” but, “if the num-
ber itself is great the percentage of a
population which exceeds 560-million
is very small.” Moreover, those of the
50,000 who were landlords were put to
death by “courts” of their own peasants,
so that the peasants, at least, can
hardly complain.
He says that the peasants accepted
the Revolution because it was better
than being pushed-around by warlords
and squeezed by landowners and be-
cause, at the outset, it shared amongst
them the landlords’ lands; and when
the Government later took the lands
away from them again and turned
them into the vast collective farms of
the North China plains (“waving
seas of wheat”), they put up with that
because their conditions were measur-
ably—though not very much as yet —
improved.
He says that the intellectuals, the
“scholar-gentry,” despite their aristo-
cratic origins, accepted the Revolution
because, taking advantage of the
knowledge of Western science and
culture which they had acquired as
teachers and diplomats under the
Kuomintang. it gave them high and
honorable positions. He says that

AN AWKWARD POLL
"VTOW that the Australian and
~ Canadian elections are out of the
way, the political contest most import-
ant for the British Commonwealth, and
perhaps the world, is soon to be held
in the United Kingdom.
It is the bad luck of the British that
their elections fall so often in crisis
and latterly that their choicq has been
so much influenced by suave promises
and a desire for change.
At the end of the war, having given
unswerving loyalty to Churchill, they
abandoned him in the moment of vic-
tory and on the very eve of the Potsdam
conference, and left the negotiations to
Attlee and Bevin, both of whom were
in the hands of a party which ranged
from old-type radical Labor-men to
starry-eyed gentlemen of foreign extrac-
tion who believed that salvation lay
in the way of handing the world over
to Stalin’s tender mercies.
Everybody who spoke with a foreign
accent or an American twang seemed
to be good to the new Labor Govern-
ment. If it was told by some outside
do-gooder to give away a colony it
gave it away.
The Attlee Labor Government went
into power with a united Common-
wealth. It was thrown out when it had
reduced the U.K. to a second-rate
Power and still on the slide, the Com-
monwealth slithering with it.
The Eden Government was buried
without honors after the Suez affair,
and Britain acquired the first Govern-
ment with any stuffing in it and with
a leader who, though he gives first
impressions of being something of a
dilettante, has all the characteristics
of the Brigade of Guards of which he
was once a fighting member—its
politeness of approach and its tough-
ness and staying-power in a conflict.
The record of the Macmillan Gov-
ernment in the past two years has been
almost inspiring by contrast with what
went before. It has stabilised the
United Kingdom economy. It has
achieved overall accord in Western
Europe among ambitious leaders so
diverse as de Gaulle and Adenauer,
and it has got along with the Ameri-
cans in a way that Eden’s or Attlee’s
Government could never hope to do.
It has carried out an immense job
in recreating the strength pf sterling
and in modernising British internal
finance, in streamlining the capitalist
system in line with the rise of the new
spending and investing classes; also, in
rebuilding bombed-out cities and in
bringing housing up to the require-
ments of an age of full employment.
Faced with the competition of rising
Continental countries, France and
Germany in' particular, it has never
panicked.
'JTIE cocksure, weeklies of New York,
whose views are syndicated and are
coming to be accepted by some British
and Australian newspapers as the last
words in truth and wisdom, last month
were exulting that West Germany
has become the second-greatest export-
ing country in the Western world,
leaving the U.K. behind. But it was
a remarkable tribute to the policy and
achievements of the Macmillan Gov-
ernment that in the same week it was
announced that the unemployment-
rate had fallen in a month in .the U.K.
from 2.9 per cent, to 2.5 per Cent., the
lowest figure for all countries of Wes-
tern Europe save France.
Labor is eager for a poll in May,
which would produce, if it won, a situa-
tion very similar to that which followed
the defeat of the Churchill Govern-
ment after the war. It would mean that,
having achieved the triumph of bring-
ing about the summit conference,
having assumed the leadership of the
West in Europe and in the Western
world jointly with President Eisen-
hower. Mr. Macmillan would be
dropped and the country would find
itself represented by Mr. Gaitskell, a
feeble doctrinaire Labor man who, in
every crisis in the last few years, has
been on the side of somebody opposed
to his own country’s interests and often
more carpingly critical of the Gov-
ernment when it needed national sup-
port than the enemies of the British
Commonwealth.
Nobody gave more aid and comfort
to Nasser than the British Labor party
during the Suez crisis, and nobody is
playing the same game more heartily
or more futilely—now.
Labor has been electioneering in the
Commons for some time with engaging
frankness. An onslaught was made
without shame on the eve of the
Prime Minister’s departure for the
United States and in the presence of a
group of visiting Russian politicians in
the gallery who were treated to the
enjoyment of hearing the leader of the
U.K. Opposition supporting their line
on Suez and announcing loudly that it
was time the “guilty men” concerned in
the attack op the Canal (i.e., Mr. Mac-
millan and Mr. Selwyn Lloyd), and
who were “sitting on those benches
over there, were brought to trial.”
That debate produced a striking
exhibition of the difference in quality
in' leadership of the two parties, and
particularly of the Prime Minister’s
potential as a campaign-leader. He
took the wind out of his opponent’s
sails with a devastating attack in which
he admitted that he had been “one of
the main supporters of Sir Anthony
Eden’s Suez policy and was proud of
it.” He added a comment: —
One method [i.e., of dealing with
crises] is to do nothing, and that is the
one that has appealed to Mr. Caitskell
and his friends in every crisis, internal
and external, in our history. The chief
idea in a difficulty is to run away from
it. The ostrich and not the eagle should
be their crest.
And of the attack on him during
the debate by Aneuran Bevan he
remarked: —•
Tonight the fire [of independence]
in him is quenched. He has been clearly
dimmed and chastened. I feel sorry for
him as he gropes about abandoned by
his own friends and comrades, a shorn
Samson surrounded on the front bench
by a body of prim and ageing Delilahs.
It is obvious in every debate that the
Opposition is getting little change in its
attacks and that when the election
comes it will find the Government
showing the characteristics of the eagle
rather than the ostrich.
r T'HE U.K. poll can only be months off
A at the most. The Boundary Com-
mission has already made its pre-
election report on proposed changes in
40 constituencies. But the necessary
preliminaries to an election —exercise
of local right of challenge and submis-
sion to Parliament—will take so much
time that it is hard to believe that the
Government contemplates an election
in May.
.Its alternatives are not easy to
choose between: a poll before the
Summit Conference, so that the Prime
Minister could take to it a guarantee
of five years in office during which to
carry out any agreement made there;
or a poll after the conference, the
imminence of which might hang over
the meeting like a cloud detracting
from the confidence of other repre-
sentatives in the permanent authority
of the United Kingdom delegates, who
would have to subject their agreements
immediately to a campaign vote.
Worse still, perhaps, if the summit
meeting were long-drawn-out, would
be an election during its progress.


THE SCALERS
“Well, looks like we’ve just made the rattler again, Billy!”


PLAIN ENGLISH
Pay, Perks and Pensions
Federal members of Parliament create
few records except in the skimpy amount
of time they spend on Parliamentary
duties and the large amount of depart-
mental work which they leave on the
hands of their private-secretaries, whose
salaries are not a third of an M.P.’s —and
no pensions. But they will be able to
congratulate each other if they pass the
Richardson recommendations (as they
will) that they have created a British
Commonwealth record in rewarding
themselves.
The new scale for the Prime Minister
-—a total of £14,350, all-up—which
adds £3900 a year to his salary and
expenses, is not excessive, though it is
on a par with salary and allowance of
the Prime Minister of the U.K., who gets
£lO,OOO sterling, plus £lOOO Parliamentary
salary and £750 tax-free allowance. It
probably places him on the same level as
the managers of great Australian financial
and business houses, and it is certainly
less than he could make at the Bar.
His is a whole-time job which calls
for tremendous stamina and application.
Nevertheless, his “rise” is ill-timed, and
out of tune with his professed economic
policy. If he went without it he would
be doing no more than many other able
administrators and executives have done
—or have had to dp—in an age where
the wage-plug has had his pay increased
3| times since 1939, but the salaried
worker has had to make-do with less
compensation for the ravages of inflation.
This is the age of the Welfare State,
remember!
In the light of the magnitude of the
job, £9150 a year, an increase of £2450,
is not too much for the Minister for
Trade, nor £BB5O a year, an increase of
£2400, for the Treasurer. These totals
include Parliamentary salaries and
electorate expense-allowances. But the
timing and method are most inappro-
priate, and war-time investors in Com-
monwealth bonds and shareholders
receiving dividends of 8 j p.c. from B.H.P.
will probably be a little envious.
Allowing that senior Ministers are
capable, the increase of £250 to £B3OO
or £8550 (according to whether country
or city) is somewhat higher than the
salaries and allowances attached to
corresponding portfolios in the United
Kingdom, which carry £5OOO sterling,
plus Parliamentary salary and expenses.
And the same applies to some of the
junior Ministers, whb go up from £5700
to £7lOO. At the same time, if applica-
tions were called in the open market to
fill these jobs at the salaries named,
there would be a flood of (in many cases)
superior talent available. Apart from
anything else, some have little say in
the running of their departments.
The increase in pay for the Opposition
is one of the most startling changes pro-
posed. It is difficult to understand what
Service the Leader of the Opposition can
possibly give for £BB5O a year.
It is the position of the ordinary mem-
ber which is the most striking. These
are to get an increase of £4OO in salary
to .£2750. They will also have a rise in
their electorate allowances of £250 —
bringing the amount to £B5O for city
M.P.s and £lO5O to country M.P.s They
are given, in addition, free secretaries
(without whom some of them could
scarcely carry on), £4 a day for travel-
ling-allowance— payable while they are
in Canberra! —and various other per-
quisites.
Free motor-cars —now to be unre-
stricted for the Deputy Leader of the
Opposition and his wife, and for ex-
Prime Ministers and Deputy Prime
Ministers for three years after their
retirement are hard to justify when
considered along with the free air-travel
for gold-pass holders and the pensions.
Especially the pensions.
It is again fair enough that a Prime
Minister after a long term should be
given a pension of £3OOO a year and
that his wife also should receive one
after his death and that ex-Ministers
should have special consideration in this
way. But the rise in the general pensions
is startling. It involves an increase of
£6 a week to £lB to members 45 to 65,
and a similar rise to £2l a week where
the member is 65 or over. Widows’
pensions will rise to £l5 a week. And
for this increase the member’s contribu-
tion goes up from £4 10s. a week to £5.
Thus by paying £2OOO in premiums over
eight years an M.P. with large private
means can enjoy for the rest of his life
an income of £llOO a year—if he is a
King .O’Malley, for 42 years.
The recommendations of the Richard-
son Committee carefully recompense
Federal M.P.s for all increases in living-
costs since the time of Federation.
Wage-earners, in the arbitration courts,
have been equally .well looked after. But
for the middle-class Australian it remains
a case of scratch as scratch can. The
investor isn’t in the race with either the
M.P. or the wage-earner. Private com-
panies are taxed outrageously to suit the
convenience of the Canberra civil service,
and depreciation allowances in business
are wholly inadequate to cope with infla-
tion. Then there is the double taxation
of company profits distributed as
dividends.
It would appear that there is one law
for the denizens of ‘Canberra and for
trade-unionists and another one for the
rest of the community.
Our Own Chocolate
Australians are great eaters and occa-
sional drinkers of chocolate. We import
a large proportion of our cocoa require-
ments from Africa, but Territories Min-
ister Paul Hasluck has just announced
that by 1963 the production in Austra-
lian Papua and New Guinea will reach
about 12,000 tons a year, or approxi-
mately our total present needs..
This won’t please the Africans, but it
will be gratifying to the white and native
planters in New Guinea, whose exports
were only 1300 tons in 1955-56.
A survey by the Bureau of Agricultural
Economics last year found that while the
cost of developing a cocoa- plantation
was heavy, the profits of the industry had
been a potent factor in increasing invest-
ment.
All this is natural, as is the export of
a portion of the yield to Britain. A
further announcement by the Minister
was to the effect that last year he had
decided to set the target for the industry
at 25,000 tons instead of the previous
12,000, and that the decision had been
made after careful consideration by his
department of the long-term economic
prospects for cocoa.
Whilst latest plans will produce an
export surplus, on current consumption
figures, it seems worth taking a chance
on markets in the future, especially in
view of the uncertain nature of wool
values these days. We need a much
broader base to our exporting capacity,
and every new industry helps.
Macmillan
The press, drawing its inspiration mainly
from the United States publicists, seems
still nebulous about what has happened
between Mr. Macmillan and the other
leaders of the West in relation to the
summit conferences.
Mr. Macmillan didn't have to reach
Washington for the dissemination of the
false statements and insinuations to begin.
After his visit to Western Europe it was
suggested that he had agreed with Dr.
Adenauer about some plan he had for
thinning-out the Western forces in
Germany.
Actually he and Dr. Adenauer appa-
rently were in agreement about the
desirability of studying the possibilities
of a controlled balance of armament in
a specific area. Both are firmly opposed
to the Rapacki plans for withdrawing
forces and discriminating against specific
weapons, or alternatively coming to a
military settlement about Central Europe
without a decisive political one.
The same suggestions that Macmillan
favored a thinning of forces was repeated
after his discussions with President
Eisenhower, with the implication that
President Eisenhower showed himself
uninterested.
The fact is that both were agreed about
the desirability of a summit conference
on an agenda and at a . time settled in
advance by the Foreign Ministers con-
ference in order to avoid the very great
chances of war over Berlin.
Both also are agreed on the vital im-
portance of the nuclear deterrent. . If
anybody voiced partiality for thinning-
out of land forces it was President
Eisenhower, who said in advance of his
meeting with the British P.M. that if
war were to break-out over Berlin, the
U.S. “will certainly not fight a ground
war in Europe.” The U.S. is actually
cutting U.S. Army and Marines man-
power at the moment. But all Western
powers are fully determined to defend
their rights and those of Western
Germany.
Where disagreement does seem to lie


is in the State Department in Washing-
ton, which is determined to keep the
lead and to give only grudging assent to
any proposal in which it does not take
the initiative.
Some of its spokesmen are emphasising
that though the British Prime Minister
has secured agreement to a summit con-
ference, and even advocates six-monthly
summit conferences to see that the world
does not drift into war, assumptions that
the conference will be held are “prema-
ture” and that “certain conditions have
to be observed before the Big Four
leaders could meet.” It is being put
about that the President has said that
the Foreign Ministers at their meeting
in May must show some accomplish-
ment to justify the summit meeting and
that a White House cloak of censorship
prevents spokesmen from saying what
conditions the President has attached to
a promise to attend the conference.
It is all very sour, the more so because
of the application of the U.S. tariff
against the English woollen trade just
before the Macmillan visit. It is to be
hoped that the Pr-esident is making up
his own mind without the help of the
careerists of Mr. Dulles’s diplomatic
set-up.
Not a great deal need be expected from
the summit conference ; but at least it
will make the Russian top-level attitude
clear. In the meantime, even de Gaulle
has made it plain that France will be
behind Western Germany and the Nato
nations in a military crisis.
N.S.W. Elections
Late counting in the N.S.W. election
increased the Cahill Government’s early
majority by one, restoring its numbers to
49, the same strength as in the old Par-
liament. But for an unfortunate mistake
in the Mudgee count which made that
seat seem a likely win for the Country
party the final result would have been
predictable on the night of the poll.
For the third time in nine years a
N.S.W. Labor Government has • been
narrowly returned. In 1950 the McGirr
Government appeared to be beaten, but
the vote of an Independent Labor mem-
ber kept it in office for another three
years. Premier Cahill picked up a few
seats in 1953 but dropped a couple in
1956. On that occasion party strengths
were equal on the Saturday night, with
several seats still in doubt. All the
doubtfuls went to Labor. This year’s
poll was almost a repetition of the
previous one. Again the doubtfuls have
all gone to Labor.
This election should put an end once
and for all to the hoary old myth that
the later stages of counting in N.S.W.
elections tell heavily against Labor. It
may have been true in the days of postal
voting—McGirr obviously thought so —
but the statistics of the last three elec-
tions show that it is no longer valid.
Absentee votes, section votes and
electoral-visitor votes follow much the
same pattern as other votes.
One point clearly demonstrated at
the election is that the D.L.P. vote is a
potent force against Evatt, but is
ineffectual against Cahill.
Another point demonstrated in recent
N.S.W. elections is that the so-called
swinging vote has, for the time at least,
ceased to swing. Making allowances for
changes in population, there is very little
difference between the figures for the
major parties in 1956 and 1959. The
inference is that people don’t swing
unless their interests or their pockets are
vitally threatened.
Finally it is clear that, lacking a deci-
sive issue, the days when the daily press
could influence the result of an election
are gone. Both Sydney dailies waged
strong campaigns against the Cahill Gov-
ernment without making even a ripple in
the current of electoral opinion.
Safety-belts
Among the more drastic recommenda-
tions, chiefly dealing with drunken
drivers, for road-safety which a depu-
tation from the B.M.A. has urged on
the Victorian Chief Secretary was
the equipment of cars with safety-belts.
The doctors’ medicine generally may
be too nasty for practical political
prescription, but in recommending
safety-belts they have given a local
stimulus to world-wide movement to
have them as compulsory standard
equipment on cars.
The protagonists of safety-belts in
many countries have come up with
remarkable sets of figures which more
than indicate the number of lives which
may have been saved by them; the
British Safety Council this month
reckoned 700 lives a year would be saved
and injuries considerably reduced by
them.
Most of the world’s chief police-forces
have been, or are being, fitted with
safety-belts; work on the Victorian
police-force’s mighty fleet of cars will
be completed in a few months, and Dr.
John Birrell, the police-surgeon who
regards them as necessary as wind-
screens, has had them fitted to his
private car.
At £4 125., they are not cheap, and
the price might resolve the family
chauffeur to drive, instead, a little slower.
Mass-production may effect considerable
saving in their cost, making them a more
attractive buy.
R.N. and R.A.N.
This year sees the end of the old-time
Royal Navy. Not only is the big ship
finished, apart from aircraft-carriers
(which are only transition craft, mainly
useful for commando use), but every-
thing larger than major destroyers is
going from the active - list, including
all the last of the old cruisers.
By 1960 there will be only three
cruisers in the Royal Navy—the Tiger
class, which have for armament four
fully automatic 6in. guns and six 3in.
automatics, and these are being criticised
by naval authorities as at best obsolescent
in an age in which the standard artillery-
weapon is becoming the guided-missile
and atomic shell.
The Tiger-class, light-cruisers by all
former conceptions of armament, com-
manded by a New Zealander, Captain
R. E. Washbourn, are wholly automatic
ships.
In the event of a nuclear weapon being
dropped in their vicinity they can be
sealed-off to operate in radioactive condi-
tions. The boiler- and engine-rooms are
capable of being controlled automatically.
There is a sprinkler-system to get rid of
radioactive fall-out on the decks, and the
guns are aimed and fired automatically
by remote control with the help of elec-
tronic machinery and radar. Their com-
plement is about 50 officers and 645 men.
Even though the ships are so complex
that in John Brown’s yards, which built
the 42,000 ton Hood for £2,500,000,
they are costing £l2 million each, there
are murmurs that they are a waste of
money.
The accent is now all on submarines,
submarine-chasers, escorts of various
types.
It would be interesting to know
exactly what the accent is on in the Royal
Australian Navy.
The R.A.N. seems to be far in the wake
of the R.N. in its naval conceptions.
On the Talk Front
By [“Ex-ACT”]
While people with varying degrees of
knowledge or ignorance of the subject
continue to talk about Communist
“subversion” in South-east Asia, and
about the excellence and magnitude of
the propaganda put over in the same
area by the Americans, the British and
ourselves, no one ever takes the trouble
to examine publicly the effectiveness of
the rival services or their impact on the
Asian populations.
It is time we knew what we are
getting through Seato and the other
propaganda-work. Do the Americans
link-up with our services so that there
won’t be overlapping or contradiction?
Do they and the British work with us —
and if not, why not? Are we getting
the best results for our broadcasts (Radio
Australia seems remarkably successful in
some areas), for all the stories supplied,
gratis, to the newspapers (“inchage” may
be the only yardstick), for the films, if
any, that we provide, and for whatever
else is represented by the phrase “anti-
subversion”?
When we hear something factual on
these aspects, perhaps we shall also be
told what the Russians and Chinese are
doing, and with what effect. They are
close to the area concerned, they make
their appeals as “fellow-Asians,” and
they have plenty of funds to spend on a
warfare which, while expensive, is far
less so than fighting.
The numbers are against us, but
perhaps we have found something which
can counter that Red advantage. If so,
why shouldn’t we be told? We provide
the money and a good many of the men,
as well as equipment. We are entitled to
learn the truth.

“An Chuidh”: Came across a dinner-
account for 1670 given at King's College,
Aberdeen, to the Lord Duffus. Some of
the prices are interesting: 2 capons,

currants, 95.; 31b. butter 155.; 3 oranges,
155.; pears and apples, 65.; lib. rice, 55.;
2 pints milk, 45.; one goose, 155.; 1-f-
-peck flour, 25.; 5 pints wine, £5. It would
seem that over 300 years the prices
of poultry and milk have only
doubled ; imported goods like currants,
wine, rice, and oranges were dear —one
wonders who ate the three oranges!
But, dairyfarmers please note, the price
of butter hasn’t seriously changed
since 1670; it’s still about five-bob!

as I unlocked and threw up the Cutler

I sewed on as he beamed at “a stitch

to house the blank waste-paper we saved
by cutting the ends off letters received.
We had enough brown-paper and string

bayside piers, mostly built in the days
of the bay steamers, are fast disappearing.
Next to go will be the Mentone pier ;
it’s to be demolished in the interest of
public safety ; and with the replacement-
cost estimated at £53,000 it’s unlikely that
a new pier at Mentone or anywhere else
will be erected. It looks as though I’ll

Australian pennies ; 52 go to the pound
avoirdupois (troy-weight is used only for
silver and gold), so that the penny is
literally light, not merely as to value.
Now, back in the days of the Georges,
16 penny-pieces went to lib. They were
made of copper—an ounce each. They
were discontinued in 1862 in favor of

“Ardoyne”: Victorian Railways are

railway porter at all — i.e., whatever he

“H.A.L..”: The Archibald Fountain in
Sydney’s Hyde Park includes one
flagrant error. Diana—or rather, Artemis,
seeing that the figures represented belong

was in reality of the traditional composite
type, like that shown in the hand of
London’s famous statue of Eros, with re-
curved ends to the limbs. Had the
sculptor studied the Greek bow as shown
on the Parthenon friezes, illustrations of
which appear in numerous books, he
would have had not only a perfect model
of a Grecian bow to copy, but also the
Greek archer’s stance, which was equally
distinctive.

derivation of this mysterious word. At
least two agreed “gringoes” stemmed not
from the Spanish language, but from
the habit of either British or American
troops in Latin America singing as a
marching- or campfire-song the then hit-
tune “Green Grow the Rushes-O.” The
writers differed only on the singers and
the war in question ; the first said it

picked him up at his residence in a
small two-seater car, and we chatted
about this, that and the other for the
40 miles we had to travel. Pulling-up
at the little church, I hopped out and
sprinted round to his Lordship's side
of the car to assist him to alight, but
he was already out of the car by the
time I got round to him. A kindly smile
lit his face as he grasped me by the
hand. “Well, T am glad to see you,
Harry, ’’ he beamed, and followed that
up with inquiries about my family's
health, and so on. It was all long ago,

The white man’s burden it’s become
To keep one wife under his thumb ;
With his conjugal army,
Were Fon to try it out you'd vote
Him an unmitigated goat
Who’d finish-up quite barmy.
The Fon, seeing that he’s survived,
By devious wnys must have contrived
To dodge their mass-affection.
He might decide, when kisses cloy,
The German measles to enjoy
To yield him full protection.
Kissing the whole damned lot good-night
Before he could put out the light
Would give a strong man shudders:
Did Fon arrange, far, far away,
Some phony war, then gaily say :
“Let’s do our duty, brudders !”?
How does he manage birthday-gifts?
Perhaps he pondered various shifts
Then hit on this —a rum thing
To us —each wife got leave to go
And earn the necessary dough
So she could give him something.
Mustering, tallying his mob
Would be a never-ending job
Demanding resolution.
Well, hoist a lid to Fon, a man
Sizzling in matrimony’s pan.
Who seems less of a husband than

LETTERS FROM MOSCOW
By MANNING CLARK
Professor Manning Clark, with Janies Devaney
and Judah Waten, representing the Fellowship of
Australian Writers, spent three weeks in the U.S.S.R. and
one week in Czechoslovakia in November last year as
guests of the Union of Writers. These are extracts from
letters written by Manning Clark.
Hotel Ukraine,
Moscow,
19th November, 1958.
I am sitting in my room in
Moscow, time 6 p.m.
From the desk where I am
sitting I can see the lights
of Moscow looking very white
in the frosty air.
I have two items of news —•
first, my stomach-upset ( cum
fever) has cleared up, thank
God. Secondly, we do not
know when or how we will be
returning to Australia. We
will probably leave on or near
26th November, and either fly
by Tiflis, Tashkent, Delhi,
Bombay, Sydney, or fly Prague,
London, Rome, Bombay,
Sydney. We will know a day
or so before we leave.
They are wonderfully kind
and generous to the point of
embarrassment (they gave us
500 roubles each for pocket-
money ), but one of their
favorite words when you ask,
for something is to say:
“Budyet!” (That will be!)
In the next few days we will
see quite a number of people.
We travelled last night on the
Red Arrow in Pullman-car
luxury. When we arrived in
Moscow it was snowing, egg-
shell snow, which the wind
swept along the streets, making
them look as though Rowland
and Benedict had emptied every
powder-box in the anteka shops
on to the bitumen.
After breakfast, conducted
in the usual leisurely way, we
went to the Children’s Book
Centre, where they study the
tastes and interests of children.
They published 171,000,000
books, not including' text-
books, for children between
the ages of 3 and 17, in 1957.
Their aims are high-minded —
enlightenment, socialist be-
havior, and to raise the
standard of culture. I hope it
does not make all the children
prigs, or, worse, lead to an
intellectual movement. In one
sense the Communist revolu-
tion was a victory for the
intelligentsia—hence their very
privileged position in income,
social prestige, creature com-
forts.
I thought of this yesterday
afternoon, when Judah and I
called on the Leningrad writers,
whose clubrooms are in a pre-
-1917 palace, with chandeliers,
gilded cornices, off - white
decorated wooden panelling a
la Louis XV. At the end of the
meeting there with' Granin,
whom the Russians put in the
first 10 writers of Ihe Soviets,
I told him, in thanking him,
that I would remember his face
and what he stood for to the
end of my days. Nearly every-
thing he says began with: ‘‘Da,
da [?], unas . . .” (“Yes, yes
[?], with us . . .”) We had a
wonderful interview which I
have written up fully in one
of the notebooks. But the
PROF. MANNING CLARK,
(before beard)
point is, the intellectuals
inherited the grandeur of
Czarist Russia, as did the-
Party.
In the morning, at Lenin-
grad, we went to the Palace
of Pioneers, an institution to
train and entertain children in
their leisure moments. We
danced with the children in
one room and heard them sing
a folksong which made me
almost weep with pleasure, so
that the spokesman for Aus-
tralia left the room without
one of his shy little speeches
which he makes three or four
times a day!
The children learn all the
crafts, play games, etc. On
the walls are slogans: “What
our land owes to the Party.”
“With knowledge we can
become strong.” “Art belongs
to the People.” It means that
hobbies are learnt collectively.
They also learn how to be
cultured — i.e., how to behave
to each other.
These are central in the
education of a Com-
munist, and you will
notice that the Party,
like the Church, is not
prepared to leave -it to
the parents. They all
look terribly jolly—and
here you see the Party
with the secret of
human happiness. No
questions are asked. In
the geology section, as
elsewhere, the materi-
alist view of the origin
of life is presented with
dignity and certainty. It must
be wonderful for those with
faith, for those who enjoy
moving with this great tide
which is rushing ashore bearing
with it, fashioning, Soviet Man.
So far I have not decided what
Soviet man will be like —a
robot, or a man of inner
resources. The whole thing
puzzles me. What is wonder-
ful is the equality, the success
in teaching people to ignore
race and color. But what
happens at the heart I cannot
find out.
Tonight we go to the house
of an editor of “Soviet World,”
and tomorrow we call on the
head of the Writers’ Union.
What an opportunity for a
teacher and a pilgrim!
Remember, we are the first
writers’ delegation from Aus-
tralia. We all get on very well
indeed.
Hotel Ukraine,
Moscow,
21st November, 1958.
When I woke up this morn-
ing I could see the pale-
blue sky, powdery-blue, and
the sheets of ice on the Moscow
River.
On the Wednesday night we
went to dinner with Gribachov,
the editor of “Soviet Union.”
It was our first peep at a Rus-
sian house. Gribachov is
Soviet Man. In some ways
they remind me of the
Elizabethans or the Athenians
after Marathon. I mean their
all-round gifts —he writes
poetry, short-stories, novels,
travel-books, edits a magazine
with a circulation of 10,000,000,
has been round the world,
fishes and hunts bears.
Words poured out of him
like a torrent: “1 love socialism
and women.” “We have gone
further than Christ ... in
mercy.” In the middle of
dinner (in the Russian manner)
he rose to his feet and recited
a poem he had just finished.
Every line was a manifesto.
I told him there was “a hot
heart within him.” Whereupon
he embraced me in the Russian
way— i.e., a tremendous kiss on
both cheeks.
On Friday night we dined
with Sophronov —a man of
20-stone, poet, novelist, song-
writer, traveller, editor of
another 10,000,000-circulation
magazine. There were 15
people there from the literary
world. They made speeches,
proposed toasts, and Sophro-
nov sang together with a
Cossack who lives next to
Sholokhov. I proposed a
toast to a lovable people, and
to two countries where one
could be happy: Australia and
Russia. The women sent greet-
ings to you and the children.
They are all astonished when
I tell them we have six chil-

feeling that children interfere
with time and energy to build
a socialist society keep families

POLITICAL POINTS
Although the new Parliament in
N.S.W. won’t be much different from the
old in party-strengths there’ll be quite
a number of changes in the personnel of
the House. Former members who have
retired are Public Works Minister J. F.
McGrath (Rockdale), one-time Minister
Maurice O’Sullivan (Paddington), F. J.
Cahill (A.L.P., Young), G. Crook
(A.L.P., Cessnock), and D’Arcy Rose
(C.P. Upper Hunter). Members missing
through failure in preselection include
S. Freeman (A.L.P., Blacktown),- G. G.
Campbell (A.L.P., Hamilton), and J.
Clough (Lib., Parramatta). Those de-
feated at the polls were Clive Evatt
(Hurstville), C. G. Robertson (A.L.P.,
Dubbo) and R. W. Murden (Lib.,
Croydon).
New members include B. J. Bannon
(A.L.P., Rockdale), T. W. Dalton (A.L.P.,
Sutherland), L. J. Ferguson (A.L.P.,
Merrylands), G. H. Neilly (A.L.P.,
Cessnock), W. M. Rigby (A.L.P., Hurst-
yille) and D. J. Mahoney (A.L.P., Parra-
matta), A. H. Dennis (Lib., Blacktown),
L. H. Ford (Lib., Dubbo), G. F. Freuden-
stein (C.P., "Young) and L. A. Punch
(C.P., Upper Hunter).
*• •
The Country party, as usual, proved
the solidity of its backing at the
N.S.W. State elections ; the weak sister
among the parties was the D.L.P.
Deserted by the Catholic vote, which
Cahill has courted with guile, it polled
fewer than 20,000 votes. Its showing,
numerically, was on a par with that of
the Communists.
• •
Distribution of D.L.P. leader J. T.
Kane’s preferences in Concord gave a
surprisingly high percentage to the sit-
ting A.L.P. member T. P. Murphy,
although the official D.L.P. card had
placed him last on the list. Kane’s 1258
votes were split: Murphy, 58S ; Mutton,
670. Murphy retained the seat by 750
votes.
• •
Closest contest in the N.S.W. election is
in Lismore, where sitting C.P. member
J. S. Easter and Independent C. J.
Campbell (Mayor of Lismore) have been
running neck-and-neck throughout. On
Monday, with only a handful of votes to
come, Campbell was leading by three.
• •
Final tallies in the Westralian x election
gave an even more closely divided Par-
liament than in N.S.W. The Liberal-
Country-party coalition won 25 seats,
Labor 23 and Independent Liberals two.
Both the freelance Libs. —W. Grayden
(South Perth) and E. P. Oldfield (Mount
Lawley)—were members of the old Par-
liament. New Liberal Premier Brand will
be dependent on their support to remain
in office. For the time being, at any rate,
he can rely on this. Neither Grayden
nor Oldfield is likely to take the responsi-
bility of forcing a new election—which
would be inevitable if they withheld their
support.
• •
The Richardson report is in two minds
whether our present Federal M.P.s are
good or bad. In one section it says that
most of the members have made sacri-
fices to enter Parliament and that they
could “fairly have expected” to be better
off financially by staying out of public
life. Later it expresses the opinion that
if M.P.s are underpaid, men of educa-
tion and quality, but without private
means, will be deterred from entering
public life and
Parliament would be composed of men
of wealth, persons subsidised by and acting
as mouthpieces of vested interests and
men whose capacities were so low that
they could not obtain well-paid positions
in private life; conditions favorable to
corruption would be created.
To guard against such a terrible possi-
bility the committee recommends an
increase of £4OO a year in salary, £250
a year in allowances and an extra 6s. 6d.
a day in travelling allowances.
The contradiction left unexplained is
this:/' If the present members aren’t
underpaid, why grant them a rise? If
they are underpaid and are yet the
estimable men the committee believes
them to be, then apparently 50 years of
underpayment haven’t produced the dire
results the committee fears. On what,
then, are they,basing their fears?

A trade-delegation from Canada is
discussing in Canberra a revision
of the 1931 trade - agreement between
Canada and Australia. When the agree-
ment was made trade between the two
Dominions was almost negligible ; Aus-
tralian exports to Canada were about £1
million a year, imports £1.4 million.
Last year our exports to Canada
totalled £l4 million, chiefly sugar, meat,
dried- and canned-fruits and wine.
Imports from Canada newsprint,
timber, motor - vehicles, machinery,
aluminium and asbestos —amounted to
£23 million.

Asserting that “the full-time service of
a member usually carries with it the
part-time service of his wife,” the Par-
liamentary Salaries report says, “she is
expected to attend many functions in
the electorate.” Maybe she is, but just
try keeping her away!

Mrs. Geoffrey Cooper, M.L.C., beat
Mrs. Wilfred Steele, M.L.A., by one
hour to become the first woman member
of the South Australian Parliament. She
was declared elected for Central District
No. 2 at noon on March 18. The declara-
tion of the poll in Burnside, Mrs. Steele’s
electorate, didn’t take place till 1 p.m.
HELP YOURSELF!


So much for election-bait. In N.S.W.
the Libs, offered free school-fares and
Labor opposed it. Labor won. In
Westralia Labor offered free school-fares
and the Libs, opposed it. Labor lost.

With TV taking-over the job begun
years ago by radio of taking politicians
into the home, it seems likely that the
public-hall and street-corner type of
electioneering is on the way out as far
as the capital-cities are concerned. That
was the feeling of all political parties in
regard to the N.S.W. election-campaign.
In Adelaide and Perth the old pattern
was still observed in the recent elections,
but in three years’ time it may be a
different story.
• •
Redistribution accounted for some
changes in the N.S.W. Assembly. Pad-
dington and Waverley were combined
into one seat; so were Croydon and
Ashfield. The Paddington - Waverley
merger was settled amicably for Labor
by the retirement of Maurice O’Sullivan.
W. J. Ferguson, who held Waverley in
the old Parliament won the new seat. The
Liberal party endorsed both the former
members for Ashfield - Croydon and
David Hunter (Croydon) won.
The creation of a new seat, Cronulla,
and changes in the boundaries of Suther-
land led Liberal lan Griffith to desert the
latter for the former. His judgment was
sound; he won Cronulla and Suther-
land reverted to Labor. Something simi-
lar happened in the Parramatta-Black-
town area. New boundaries made Liberal-
held Parramatta look a safe seat for
Labor and Labor-held Blacktown a
likely win for the Libs. In between, a
new seat, Merrylands, looked a Labor
certainty. This caused a reshuffling of
nominations in the area and in the re-
sultant game of musical chairs Clough
(Lib., Parramatta) and Freeman (A.L.P.,
Blacktown) both missed-out.
Voting on March 21 confirmed pre-
dictions about these seats. From a party
viewpoint Labor gained one seat on the
metropolitan reshuffle.

In the days before surfing became
popular the ocean seemed to our
scientifically - benighted forefathers the
ideal and obvious place for sewage-
disposal. Now we have residents of
Sydney and Perth, and probably some
other places, complaining bitterly of pol-
lution. It’s about time both cities in-
vestigated the latest American methods
of disposal, which employ modern
chemistry and yield economic as well as
more obvious benefits.

“D.”: Nobody loves the Victorian Egg
Board, except, perhaps, a few big pro-
ducers, and a few more reasons came
to light at the State branch meeting of
the National Utility Poultry Breeders’
Association: A Narre Warren North
poultry-farmer, working in a shed 100
yards from his house, was confronted
by two Egg Board inspectors with a
piece of paper he had left on his dining-
room table; a Springvale poultry-
farmer’s premises had been entered by
police, authorised by the board, but
without a search - warrant; there were
complaints that eggs are post-dated far
ahead; a breeder had been fined for
refusing to open an incubator during
the middle of hatching; and —an old com-
plaint—handling-charges are excessive.
Dick Gainey, Liberal M.L.A. for
Elsternwick, is leading a movement for
a select committee to analyse the un-
pleasant omelette.

Sugargrowers in North Queensland
want a refinery in their area ; they argue
this would save the freight incurred in
shipping raw sugar south and bringing
it back refined—also that it would pro-
vide employment in the slack season.
When they raised the subject at their
annual conference in Brisbane they were
told that the two refineries at Brisbane
and Bundaberg could handle Queens-
land’s present requirements and their
capacity could be increased if necessary.
A refinery in the north would merely
lower the tonnage available for the exist-
ing refineries, thereby increasing their
costs —which would have to be paid for
largely by the growers.
The northern growers weren’t greatly
impressed, but agreed to let the matter
ride till next year.

One solution to Britain’s traffic prob-
lems being tried with success is the
building of express roadways 45 feet
above existing railway tracks, which
secured their exclusive rights-of-way up
to a century or more ago. There is little
interference with rail traffic, as pillars
are erected in pairs w'ell clear of the
tracks, and the roadways are put in
position without any blockage to rail-
tracks. The roads go clear over stations
and other traffic bridges, and can be
entered and left by cloverleaf under-
.passes. Some of the inner portions of
Australian cities might lend themselves
to a similar development.

“Fuzzy Wuzzy”: With the appoint-
ment of two native members to Bougain-
ville council a new stage has been reached
in the political development of Papua-
New Guinea —all district advisory coun-
cils now include Papuan or New
Guinean representatives. The two new
members are Anthony Kiari, 37, who
operates his own coconut-plantation on
Buka, and Uniori Tasivina, 45, senior
elder of the N.aonanata clan, of Teop, on
the east coast. Tasivina was a carrier
for the Allied forces during the war and
later a medical orderly.

Major errors in the primary count
occurred in three N.S.W. electorates.
In North Sydney, which was being re-
garded as a barometer seat on the Satur-
day of the poll, Liberal candidate R. J.
Newton’s total was understated by 1000
votes. The error wasn’t detected until
Monday and in the meantime theorists
had a field-day thinking up reasons why
there had been a big swing to Labor
in North Sydney and no signs of it any-
where else. The missing thousand
brought Newton within striking-distance
and meant that A.L.P. member Ray
Maher (as in 1956) would have to depend
on preferences to hold his seat.
Another early miscount, in Ryde, gave
F. G. Downing (A.L.P.) more than 200
votes which should have been in Liberal
I. H. Millar’s pile. The correction made
no difference to the fate of the seat. A,
much more serious mistake occurred in
the Mudgee poll and it wasn’t discovered
till Wednesday. An error in the trans-
mission of a telegram gave N. L. Griffith
(C.P.) 700 votes too many. As a result
Griffith looked like winning the closely-
contested seat on Liberal and D.L.P.
preferences. The adjusted figures put him
well behind Liberal, candidate J. Ives, so
he will now be the one eliminated from
the final count. More important still,
the seat will now probably go to L. M.
Nott, the sitting A.L.P. member, whose
party had written him off as an election
casualty.

When the N.S.W. Parliamentary
Country-party meets on April 8 for re-
election of officers it is expected that

Of all Australian States, N.S.W. has
the highest percentage of civil pen-
sioners and the A.C.T. the lowest. In
N.S.W. 6.36 per cent, of the population
receive either age-, part - rate age- or
invalid-pensions. Canberra's low rate
(1.68 per cent.) is explained by there
being a higher percentage of young
people in the A.C.T. than anywhere else
in Australia. In N.S.W. 4.51 per cent,
of the population are on full-rate age-
pensions, 1.07 per cent, on part-rate and
.78 per cent, on invalid-pensions. Over-
all figures for other States are: Victoria,
5.24 p.c.; Queensland, 6.13 p.c.; South
Australia, 5.73 p.c.; Westralia, 5.48 p.c.

Harold Macmillan must have jolted his
Russian TV audience in his broadcast
just before he left Moscow. He told
them that British per capita • production
was more than twice that of Russia ; that
British inventions in the present genera-
tion have included radar, the jet-engine
and penicillin ; and that the first TV
pictures ever to be transmitted had been
seen in Britain more than 30 years ago.
He also talked about the harnessing of
atomic power, the radio-telescope at
Jodrell Bank (“which provided valuable
information about the Russian sputniks”),
and the British holding of world land-
and water-speed-records and of the
highest standard-of-living in Europe.
Loyal comrades no doubt dismissed all
these claims as capitalist lies, but per-
haps some of the began to
wonder.

from the department to assist with com-
munications at Woomera ; then became
chief-engineer of the supply-department
there and at Salisbury (W.A.), and in
1957 was appointed deputy engineer-in-
chief in Melbourne.
Arthur Noel (“Huck”) Finlay, who’s
been the A.B.C.'s assistant-general-
manager since 1946, is a Sydneysider,
educated at Grammar and the Uni. He
read law, became associate to Mr. Justice
James (1929-32), then went back to
Grammar as house-master, writing
children’s stories in his spare time and
broadcasting these and sporting com-
mentaries for the A.8.C., which he joined
“HUCK” FINLAY
in 1935 as N.S.W. sporting-editor and
boss of educational broadcasts. In 1937
he moved up to the job of Queensland
manager, enlisting in the A.I.F. a couple
of years later, to be posted to Northern
Command H.Q. From there, with his
age making it unlikely that he’d get
overseas, he transferred to the R.A.Ff
Posted then to Malaya as a ground-staff
officer, he won the M.C., but was bagged
by the Japs, and spent the rest of the
war as p.-0.-w. in Sumatra and Changi.
Pictured here by Dubois, “Huck”
Finlay represented both his school and
university at Rugby Union, rowing,
athletics and swimming. He toured with
the Waratahs, was N.S.W. Rugby Union
captain and vice-captain for Australia ;
and he’s well known, too, as a rowing-
coach. In 1953 he was awarded the
American Smith-Mundt Fellowship,
which gave him three months in the
U.S., studying radio and television in
particular and the American way of life

“Uramao”: The M.C.C. tour of New
Zealand brought back memories to 90-
year-old H. F- Thomson, of Dunedin,
who came to N.Z. from Victoria as an
eight-year-old, spent 70 years in Canter-
bury, and was a leading light in cricket
nearly all that time —both in the field
and in administration. One highlight
he recalls was a match at Christchurch
in the 1880’s, when an Australian team,
including “demon”-bowler F. R. Spof-
forth and W. L. Murdoch (who scored
111), played a fine game. Another is
having himself played in England against
W. G. Grace.

“R.R.D.”: Tall and spare, General
Sir Richard Hull looks every inch a
cavalryman. He joined the 17th/21st
Lancers in 1928, commanded his regi-
ment in 1941, arid in November, 1942,
led a mechanised column, “Bladeforce,”
350 miles in two-and-a-half days through
difficult country and some
opposition in a coup de main
against Tunis —one of the
swiftest advances in military
history. At 37 he was given
command of the British Ist
Armored Division in Italy and
later of the sth Infantry Divi-
sion in Northern Germany.
Commandant of the Staff Col-
lege, Camberley (Eng.), after the
war, he was later made chief-
instructor at the Imperial De-
fence College and was G.O.C.
British Troops in Egypt at the
time of the 1954 British Army
withdrawal. In 1956 he became
Deputy-Chief of the Imperial
General Staff, and last June
succeeded General Sir Francis Festing as
C.-in-C. Far East Land Forces. His

lan C. Dutton, of Wilgian Queen
Apiaries and Laboratory, Manilla

for the Royal Easter Show. He has
always lived in N.S.W. His great-grand-

was born in Sydney, and, after Hurlstone
Agricultural School, worked on beefarms
on the coast and inland, becoming a
honey-tester for the Producers’ Co-opera-
tive Society, and starting his own queen
apiaries at Scone a dozen years back.
Thence he moved to Inverell, but found
the country there not suitable for the
little toilers, and finally settled in the
Tamworth-Manilla area.
This year he won first-prize for his

ABORIGINALITIES
abos. are not generally noted for
humorous understatement they
lean more to a sense of the ridiculous
and to pantomime—but Charlie Denison,
who died in Goondiwindi (Q.) Hospital
at the age of 110, gave a fine example.
Charlie had drafted cattle until he was
102, when he made the greatest under-
statement of all time: “I’ve had enough.
I think I'll give my flesh a rest.”
Then there was Laughing Charlie,. a
black lath 7ft. long, who was King of
Maroonga, an island in the Crocodile
group off the N.T. coast. I asked Charlie
if there were any ducks on his island.
Quoth Laughing Charlie:
“Quack quack all alonga your grand-
mudder! your grandpuppa! your unkul!
your aunti! ’longa piccaninny! ’longa
this pheller belly! ’longa that one!
Planty quack quack!”
“Don't Worry —I always lose my appetite when I have to cook
my own meals”
The two Yam Island (Torres .Straits)
boys aboard our yawl often broke into
roars of laughter long after we’d left
Maroonga behind. They would imitate
Laughing Charlie’s statement of all the
relations who could feed on Maroonga
ducks, and then guffaw at great length.
Of course they instinctively understood
that the humor of the situation was the
thin king airing his English because “he
had been longa Darwin.”
Parjoo, one of the Yam Islanders, was
a keen student Of humanity, and, also,
a good humorist. We were tied-up to
the Burketown wharf. The Yam Islanders
were not too happy about the strange
aborigines who, though born only a
thousand miles from Yam Island, were
like natives from another planet. I
wanted the boys to come with me up
to old storekeeper Scholes’s place,' to
pick-up some stores, but Parjoo was
hanging back.
“Come on, Parjoo,” I said, gesturing
at a young gin who looked at him with
invitation in her eyes. “Come on, they
won’t eat you.”
Parjoo continued to look at me in
silent appeal.
“What's wrong? Is she pointing the
bone at you?”
“No, boss. That one she pointem eye.”
One of the finest abo. stockmen I
ever saw was on Kamilaroi station, a
couple of hundred miles north of Clon-
curry. He was a huge man, but quick
and seemingly tireless. They had been
cutting-out all the hot, steaming morn-
ing, and now the big chap was preparing
to have his midday snack. A thin little
abo. stockman in a large hat and a
pyjama coat (he wore no trousers)
watched the big fellow cut a steak big
enough for six and grill it, or, rather,
burn it on the outside.
“Samson!” said Pyjama Coat. “You
altogether hungry phellar!”
“You allsame eatem galah. Plenty
noisy phellar!” instantly retorted the big
stockman.

“M’Lou”: Edenhope (Vic.) football-
club has been financially secure since
its committee and players went in for
share-farming. Last year the club cleared
about £sop from 35 acres of oats grown
on a district farm ; this year it did even
better with 48 acres of wheat.

“Dentonio”: For more than 80 years
ships have been carefully avoiding a
non-existent shoal between Fiji and
Western Samoa —the Zephyr Shoal. Its
non-existence was proved recently by the
Royal N.Z. Navy survey-ship, Lachlan.
The shoal, first reported in 1875 by
Captain Wilson of the schooner Zephyr,
is believed to have been water discolored
by rafts of plankton or by floating
pumice from volcanic eruption.

“A. Acombe”: I dips me lid to Dame
Mary Gilmore (B. 25/2/’59), but if that
grand old lady had split as many slabs
as I have she would know why we used
a wooden maul with iron wedges. It
wasn’t to save our hands—to do that
we used springy bush saplings as handles
—but to save the wedges. I have seen
iron sledges used, but they “burred” the
wedges so that they couldn’t be driven
properly home, and couldn’t be “double-
banked” because of the flange. Also,
both hammers and wedges soon wore-
out. Properly treated, a set of wedges
would last indefinitely, and a pair of
rings almost as long. We always kept
a bit of well-seasoned grey ironbark or
box handy, and making a new maul cost
nothing but some spare time.

“Motuku”: Leafcutter - bees (B.
11/2/’59) are members of a very large
world-wide family. There are many Aus-
tralian species, 33 of them listed and
described by Tarlton Rayment, “the Aus-
tralian Fabre,” as far back as 1935. The
species described by “Gravelsnatcher” is
probably Megachile cetera. Like most
leafcutters, this species is not at all par-
ticular about the kind of hole it uses
for a nursery, provided the size is right.
Nail- and bolt-holes; tunnels of wood-
boring beetles or their larvae ; deserted
holes of carpenter-bees ; shafts sunk by
cicadas, bardie - grubs and pupating
sphinx-moth caterpillars and sawfly larvae
have all been used. Cells are sealed with
“some dark adhesive substance secreted
by the bee,” and the hole is plugged with
“a hard putty of masticated gumleaves.”
At Rayment’s home in Gippsland he had
many suitable man-made tunnels fin.
bolt-holes purposely left in the walls
after his concrete house was built.

macularis, with six small, light spots on
the thorax and five narrow, pale bands
on the abdomen placed their leafy
cradles in the walls. They didn’t seal
the holes, but filled the cavity at each
end of the cell-cartridge with a packing
of leaf-pieces. Anyone wishing to study
the structure of the nursery and the cell-
contents can use Rayment’s method of
lining suitable holes with hollow paper
cylinders which can be withdrawn with
a pair of tweezers without damaging the
leafy cartridge or its contents. Any of
our museums would be glad to get speci-
mens of the leafcutters and their nurseries,
as well as the flowers they visit-for nectar
and pollen, for, in spite of the vast
amount of research done by Rayment
and other experts, the picture is far from
complete.

“Fuzzy Wuzzy”: Before Administra-
tion control was established in the Mt.
Hagen area (N.G.) eight years ago there
were few runaway wives absconders
went over a 300 ft. cliff unless they agreed
to return to their husbands. But things
are changing. The Director of Native
Affairs reports that women in the area
are not only seeking divorces at the rate
of three a day but are also increasingly
demanding marriage by choice instead of
through the old tribal practice of arrange-
ment between parents. Civilisation
looming?

“Kate”: Why were the cicadas silent
'during Melbourne’s heatwaves? Their
noise was deafening each day until the
temperature reached the century-mark—
then all was' silence. You could bet on
it, and we had too many over-the-century-
mark days for it to have been mere
coincidence.

“Sevenelms”: Protection against the
tropical sun (B. 11/3/ ’59)? Once heard
the Governor of British North Borneo
—double-terai,y&pine-pad and all —acidly
reprove an Australian logging superin-
tendent up the Malapulet River for his
hatlessness at 7.30 a.m. Allowing for
his Ex.’s hidebound misguidedness, it was
still rank discourtesy, because he was,
pursuant to a Government House party
the night before, two hours late for a
carefully planned rendezvous to bag a
tusker. The disconcerted Aussie left
abruptly, so the Governor never got
properly briefed on the terrain and the
fact that jumbo had already received
two .303 bullets that could have made
him dangerously man-wise. Governor
never got elephant, but elephant nearly
got Governor.

“H.C.8.”: Something not true to form
about “Maitri’s” peeweev “unduly affected
by wet weather” (B. 4/3/’59). The nor-
mal bush peewee continues his foraging
without regard for light rain, and is first
out from shelter when a deluge eases.
His preference for scrounging in damp
places has earned him the nickname of
“mudlark”; and, far from becoming be-
draggled in wet weather, the hen peewee
sits in her roofless mud nest and not only
keeps the eggs dry but generates enough
heat to hatch them —an impossibility,
surely, for a shivering bird. Furthermore,
she looks quite comfortable and happy
about it all. I submit that '“Maitri’s”
shiverers were sick birds, or had become
soft with easy living.

“Amcee”: Near Ballarat (Vic.), two
men vainly searching for, a lost sheep-
dog met a water-diviner. The dog’s
owner asked the diviner if he would try
to divine the whereabouts of the dog.
The diviner fashioned a rod from a piece
of 8-gauge galvanised fencing-wire about
4ft. long, and, bending over a length of
6in., held this against the metal of the
dog’s collar. Presently the wire swung
in the direction of an old mining-ground.
Following the rod the men covered about
“RUBBER sponges!”
half-a-mile, whistling and calling. Soon
they heard a dog barking. The lost
animal was in an old mineshaft about 7ft.
deep. The diviner said he had dowsed
in many States, but this was the first
time he’d brought-off anything like that.
Still, maybe the dog was part water-
spaniel.

“Mark Heim”: My elderly friend
visited the uncle he had known years
before in the free - living mid - west
around Dalby (Q.). The old fellow
spends his declining days in an
institution for the aged; he seemed
quite happy. “Anything you’d like?”
asked the nephew. “Well, they look
after you pretty well on the whole,”
said the uncle, “but I’d give a lot for
a supply of Nelsoni sanguini.” The
nephew dropped to his meaning. “I’ll
fix that straight away,” said the nephew,
remembering a hotel he’d passed a few
blocks away, well-stocked with Beenleigh.
“Take it easy, son. It’s not as simple
as all that. You’ll have to go home and
wash-out a sauce-bottle or two, and bring
down the good old stuff next time you
come. On this ship it’s strictly forbidden.
It could mean walking the plank.”

“Spin”: “Liewahlo” doesn’t say what
species of kingfisher he found entering
and leaving a hole in a termite’s nest
(B. 25/2/’59), so it’s hard to say whether
they were nesting there or merely feed-
ing. In W.A. we have three species of
kingfisher—apart from the two species
of kookaburra. The red - backed king-
fisher, which ranges over most of the
State and seems to be extending into
the south-west corner, will sometimes
nest in a termite-mound that's been built
up the trunk of a tall tree. In fact, that’s
the only elevated position I’ve ever seen
them nest in; when they can’t get a
high termite-nest they tunnel into the side
of a creek or a cliff. The northern species,
the mangrove-kingfisher, and the south-
west bloke, the sacred - kingfisher, both
nest in holes high in trees; but I’d
never be surprised to see the latter
burrowing into a termite-mound. Those
that choose nesting-sites near swamps or
rivers live largely off the water-life, but
insects, grasshoppers and perhaps an
occasional mouse also appear on their
menu.

“Tropic”: Melbourne newshounds,
please note: Yes, it’s true that a crocodile
was seen in the flooded Fitzroy River, on
which Rockhampton (Queensland)
stands, and yes, the police, armed with
rifles, watched for its reappearance. But
no, dear reporters, that crocodile did not
devour fowls and dogs. It was not seen
again. It was an extremely rare visitor
to our “crocodile-infested waters.”


'T'he Court of Petty Sessions had
finished the hearing, and the country-
town constable had left smartly with the
prisoner for the coastal jail. One of the
Jaypays fooling about with a pair of hand-
cuffs left on the desk fitted the bracelet
neatly to his left wrist, and the inside
tatcheted circle clicked home. Much
seaching in all hidey-holes, but no key.
Constable’s wife said that Jim always
carried the key wrth him. So the loose
end was tied back to the forearm and
the shirt-sleeve turned down. Then the
experimenter settled down to a 36-hour
wait for John Hop. I can now assure
the uninformed that bobby-pins, paper-
clips, corkscrews, smart raps on stones
and what-not will not snap open the
darbies now issued to the Queensland
Police. —“Norque.”

“Curio”: It doesn’t matter, “R.A.McC.”
(B. 11/3/’59), how a fleece is thrown—
over your head, or between your legs
if you prefer it. What matters is how it
lands on the table. Any smart aleck who
landed his fleece upside-down (there is a
more descriptive term —unfortunately un-
printable—for such an act) on the table
would not be popular. Just try to roll
a skin-side-up fleece so that the cut edge
of the shoulder-wool is readily seen by
the classer! In a big shed, with wool
coming thick and fast, the fleeces have
to be skirted, rolled, and off the table
pretty smartly.

“Wommadoo”: My nomination for
“Stromlo’s” medal for public men carry-
ing out their duties with some display
of humor (B. 18/2/’59) is a former Chief
Secretary of N.S.W. who, after repeated
requests to declare an open season on
kangaroos in certain areas where they
were very numerous, finally agreed to
their destruction during a limited period,
provided that only males were killed.

“Permie”: Australia gets through an
annual 6000 tons of coffee —practically
all of it from East Africa. The Papuan
harvest this year will total 800
to 900 tons, but growers will be
hard put to sell more than half of
it. Diehard buying-arrangements result
in high-grade, comparably priced New
Guinea coffee being passed-over in favor
of the East African product. If this con-
tinues, another young industry will join
a lot of others on the N.G. scrap-heap.

“Bert the Carpenter”: I’ve lost count
of the number of times I’ve heard that
the tone of the violins made by Amati,
or by Antonio, Francesco and Omobono
“I'm not interested, are you ?”
Stradivarius is due to “the varnish which
they used —a secret now lost.” An old
Italian violin-maker assured me this was
nonsense. Varnishing a violin certainly
did call for great skill and plenty of
patience, for many coats had to be
applied, each one allowed to dry-out and
set thoroughly before applying another,
and then the varnish had to be ground-off
to a smooth surface with pumice-powder
and brought to a. high polish with
chamois leather and elbow-grease. But
this couldn't put tone into an instrument;
that came from selection of materials.
He took a slab of the Balkan maple that
is used for the back, quarter-sawn, with
an interlocked grain, held it by one
corner and flicked it all over with a
fingernail. “Dead spot here,” he remarked.
“Hear how dull it sound? It never make-
it the good instrument!” As a further
test he used a violin bow on the edges
of the board, then placed it on a large
stack of discards. Similar tests were
given to a piece of quarter-sawn Swiss
pine, grown on a hillside which caught
the sun ; it was for a violin belly. Finally
catne the pairing of all the flawless
pieces of pine and maple with identical
notes when tapped. Even so, as the old
boy showed me, one slip of the gouge
during the preliminary shaping-out of
back or belly could ruin it.

“Manamoi”: Two pub - names which
show at least some originality are the
Waltzing Matilda at Cobbadah, a road-

men in Longreach (Q.).

"Dig Paddy, 20st. of Irish wit and
villainy, and with a big cast in one
eye, was part of a well - patronised,
illegal game up North. One of the per-
manent gamblers, a chap of flaring
temper, carried his wad in his hand, and,
when things were going wrong for him,
would toss it all oil the table and dance
on his hat.
The croupiers usually raked-in a per-
centage of this while the irate punter was
busy wrecking his lid. Paddy was doing
just this when the irascible one came
out of his act and sighted his money
going into the cache in the “boot” of
the table.
With a roar like an infuriated bull he
whipped-out a long knife and started
chasing Paddy round the table, making
lunges at his bulging stern, while the
boss stood in the doorway yelling, “Clock
him with a chair!”—which nobody
heeded.
Paddy’s great bulk was making vast
inroads into his breath as he tried to
gain that extra couple of yards which
would enable him to make a break for
the door, where the trump held the
bridge with a chair ready to heave it
in front of the punter and slam the door
to behind Paddy.
After about the twelfth circle of the
table, Paddy, thinking he had enough
lead, dived for the doorway. The boss
duly heaved the chair, but not quick
enough to prevent the punter making his
final lunge with the knife, which cut
most of the seat out of Pat’s bulging
pants.
Paddy’s comment after he emerged
from his refuge: “Thank God I’ve been
on a diet and lost about two-stone, other-
wise he'd have hacked-off plenty of rump-
steak!”

B.H.P. Steel
About the time B.H.P.
announced its 1959 new
issue of shares, advance copies
of the Department of Trade’s
survey of the steel industry in
Australia became available.
-Prepared as at November,
1958, the survey deals pretty
thoroughly with the history,
present and future capacity,
nature and control, raw-
material availability, and
supply-and-demand position of
the industry.
In dealing with future expan-
sion, it is mentioned that an
expenditure of £3O million
would probably pay for a
250,000-ton-capacity steel plant
at Whyalla in S.A. As current
rated capacity of the whole
industry today is 2.8-million
tons, and demand by 1962 is
estimated at 4.5-million tons,
it is easy to see that provision
of the additional 1.7-million
tons would involve an enor-
mous capital-outlay if the
estimates of the department are
correct as to the tonnage and
cost of the Whyalla project.
Prospects of continuing
heavy capital-outlay appear to
have prompted the share-
market into bidding high for
B.H.P. shares almost regardless
of present dividends and yield.
But, as the departmental survey
points out, and as The
Bulletin has pointed out so
often, at present the B.H.P.
group seems to intend to pay
for expansion mostly out of
internal resources. This in the
past has meant that dividends
have been kept low, and it is
likely to mean the same thing
in the future—until the neces-
sity for plough-back eases.
That is notwithstanding
periodic share-issues of, say,
£lO million or so.
The department’s survey
discusses at some length the
possibility of rival steelworks
setting-up in opposition to
8.H.P., and says that “a new-
comer to basic iron-and-steel
production, though he would
find that in general the six State
Governments were interested
in encouraging the establish-
ment of basic iron-and-steel-
making within their respective
boundaries, could be faced with
a number of problems.” One
such problem would be “to
obtain adequate and suitable
ore supplies from deposits not
at present under lease to
8.H.P.” Even now B.H.P. has
sources of supply in New
Caledonia tied to it, apart from
Iron Knob and Yampi.
So long as B.H.P. has a
monopoly of steelmaking in
Australia it will continue to be
under the scrutiny of many
different interests throughout
the country, and it will be
reminded from time to time if
its output does-not keep pace
with demand, as was demon-
strated a few years ago when
J. P. Abbott, M.P., carried on
a jcrusade, supported by the
S.A. Minister for Mines, for an
adequate supply of steel being
a condition to B.H.P.’s con-
tinued access to raw materials.
This political spur is likely
to keep B.H.P. fully aware of
the need to produce sufficient
supplies of steel to meet Aus-
tralian demand, and to under-
line the fact that large lumps
of capital will be called for
annually. But it has already
been made plain by B.H.P. it-
self that ploughed-back profits
will be called on to finance a
major share *of the expansion
planned over the next few
years, so that worth-while
benefits from B.H.P. as an
investment at present market
prices, other than through the
sometimes illogical expecta-
tions of “market increment,”
are likely to be deferred for
several years.
John Fairfax Shares
/Considerable speculation is
going on as to the reason
for the steep rise in the price of
John Fairfax shares, which
sold at 525. last week, as
against a “low”of 245. 3d. in
1958 and a “low” of 18s. 6d.
in the previous year. First
reason would appear to be its
TV interests—everyone having
gone a little TV-crazy recently.
Second would be the various
benefits which have arisen
from the investment in Aus-
tralian Newsprint Mills, Ltd.
—a real moneyspinner. Third
has been the lift in the interim
div.-rate to 12 p.c. p.a. (total
9-1- p.c. last year), whereas it
appeared that the board had
previously aspired only to a
respectable and dignified 10
“You’d be surprised—that possie is as safe as a bank!"
p.c. This div.-lift has raised
a fourth line of conjecture.
Was it prompted (however
easily it could be afforded)
partly by a desire to shake-off
any would-be takeover con-
cern by making it pay dearly
in the market for the shares?
Originally two-million £1
ords. were passed-over to the
Fairfax family and other pro-
prietors as part-payment for
Sydney “Herald” and its asso-
ciated publications, and the
public was offered another
two-million ords. Thus it
would be difficult for any other
company, however powerful,
to acquire control of the
“Herald” and its chain with-
out the sanction of the Fairfax
family.
New Partnerships
[From Canberra]
An increasing number of
overseas investors are
likely to offer partnerships to
Australian interests in the
establishment of new or
expanded industries in Aus-
tralia. This is interesting in
view of the recent Kraft dis-
solution of partnership with
Australian investors.
The Federal Government has
adopted a new practice of
advising prospective investors
that it might not be a bad idea
if they entered into partner-
ship with established Australian
concerns and offered them
some equity capital.
The last six or so definite
inquiries as to investment con-
ditions have resulted in the

backers promising to consider
this aspect.
Mr. Menzies has said Aus-
tralia welcomes overseas
capital because it' can’t pro-
vide sufficient from its own
resources to meet the need for
expansion. He added that the
Government had no power to
lay down any rule on the
question, but always made its
viewpoint quite clear to pro-
spective investors. “I have
seen real evidence lately that
more and more investors are
coming round to our point of
view,” he said.
Ricketson’s View
[From Melbourne]
CJTANIFORTH RICKETSON, chair-
man (among others of the
corporated family) of Capel
Court Investment Co. (Aust.),
Ltd. (and chief partner in J. B.
Were and Son, the Melbourne
sharebrokers, who have been
one of the leading protagonists
in the encouragement of over-
seas investment in Australia, is
the latest financier of tonnage
to see disadvantages in the
total ownership of Australian
companies by foreign corpora-
tions.
Mr. Ricketson’s undeniable
point is that the complete
exclusion of Australian
nationals from any share in
the equity of the Australian-
based companies meant the
foreign corporations reaped
handsome profits from the
huge public and private ex-
penditure provided by the Aus-
tralian public and the splendid
market created by Australian
skill, enterprise and money.
The Prime Minister (at the
time of the Kraft deal) voiced
very much the same national
sentiment but pointed out there
was no means by which part-
nerships in equity capital with
Australians could be enforced ;
the broker says it should be
continually and strongly
brought to their notice, just the
same.
Australian Sugar
TTnder the new International
Sugar Agreement, the
Australian sugar industry will
receive the added protection
of a stronger international
agreement reinforcing the exist-
ing Commonwealth Sugar
Agreement. Five new countries
have promised to participate
in the new agreement. They
include the important sugar-
exporting countries of Brazil
and Peru.
Almost all the exporting
member-countries which were
parties to the previous agree-
ment forwent claims to higher
quotas in the new agreement.
However, British Common-
wealth sugar-exporters won
acceptance of the principle that
they were entitled to share in
the increased consumption of
sugar within the Common-
wealth.
Quotas for the Common-
wealth group of countries will
remain at the existing level of
2,500,000 tons in 1959, but will
be raised to 2,575,000 tons in
1960 and 1961. Australia’s
quota in these last two years
will increase from 632,000 tons
to about 650,000 tons.
The Australian sugar season
closed at the end of 1958
with a record production of
1,370,000 tons. Present indi-
cations are that 1959 will be
another favorable year for
sugar production in Australia.
Containing Costs
\X/hen Roy Owen retired last
year as manager of
Huddart Parker, Ltd., he was
sent abroad to look into the
packaging business, which was
reputed to be sweeping the
shipping-freight world. He
found that it was so indeed,
and that the pack-it-yourseif
container had actually collared
about 90 per cent, of the U.S.
trade.
The first result of Mr.
Owen’s mission was the in-
auguration on March 20 of
the container system between
Melbourne and Hobart. It is
being operated jointly by
Huddart Parker and the Union
S.S. Co., and will cut freight-
rates on this sea-trip from
£l9 13s. to £l6 for a load of
2 tons llcwt. ; the Karoon and
the Warringa, both motor-
vessels, now are scheduled to
leave on alternate Fridays and
to unload on the following
Mondays.
The next development no
doubt will be the opening of
the container system on the
Australian coastal run. This
decision will be made by the
associated steamship-owners,
which include Huddart Parker
but not the Union Co., and is a
far bigger venture than that
which has now been under-
taken.
In the Melbourne-Hobart
run only two ports have had to
be organised ; on an Australian
coastal run, such as Sydney-
Fremantle or Adelaide-Bris-
bane, there would be at least
four in the usual voyage, re-
quiring a very careful shipping
schedule.
Melbourne shipping - men
have no doubt the system will
be introduced and that it will
be most successful.
On the Melbourne-Hobart
service the containers are

wharf-handling, insurance and

Fitzroy Basin
[From L. Owen]
'T'he announcement of the
striking of rock-salt in
Frome Rocks No. 1 well
allowed of two possible inter-
-pretations—either that the salt
was an evaporite in situ, or
that it had reached the position
at which it was encountered by
upward flow through faulted
or soft strata.
Owing to the ease with which
it shears, salt is very prone to
upward migration—in fact, it
flows under quite small differ-
ences of pressure potential—
and its presence within the
Fenton fault system should not
give rise to astonishment,
although it is surprising as the
first discovery of salt, in mass,
on the Australian mainland.
Now that Frome Rocks No.
2 well (sited four miles south
of No. 1) has passed through
“a normal sequence of lime-
stone” above 3918 ft., whilst
No. 1 well was in salt from
2263 ft. to the point at which
drilling was suspended at
4000 ft., the “evaporite in situ”
origin may be discounted. On
the other hand, it seems going
too far to suggest (as Wapet’s
“Digest” has done) that geolo-
gical conditions at the Frome
Rocks No. 1 site are similar
to those existing in Rumania.
The Fitzroy Basin structures
are by no means simple ones,
but it would seem unjust to the
prospects of striking com-
mercial oil there to compare
them to those which have been
so intensively studied in the
Rumanian oil-fields.
Assuming—as I have done
always—that the chances that
commercial quantities of oil
exist at depth in the Fitzroy
Basin region are good, the
total absence of measureable
oil-seeps would be extremely
difficult to explain away on the
hypothesis that the type-
structure followed the
Rumanian pattern.
Such oil as has been encoun-
tered is—like the salt —migra-
tory, and I would again impress
the necessity for discovering
the direction of the paths
along which that oil has
travelled from its primary
reservoir-beds.

Postwar Factory Expansion
'T'he astonishing growth of
Australia’s industrial-
capacity since the beginning of
the war has been highlighted
by figures released by the Act-
ing Commonwealth Statistician,
K. M. Archer.
Since 1938-39, the number of
industrial-producting factories
in Australia has doubled, with
a similar increase in employ-
ment, but the value of output
has increased approximately
eight times and the value of
wages paid nine times. (Infla-
tion, of course, has been a
factor.)
In 1957-58 Australia had
53,992 factories, employing
1,073,400 people, whose wages
totalled £929,398,000, and
whose output reached the stag-
gering figure of £4,275,448,000.
A look at the pre-war figures
will show the, tremendous
growth—26,94l factories were
then employing 565,106 people
and producing goods worth
£500,420,000.
Total wages in 1938-39
were only £106,743,000.
The average factory wage in
1957-58 was approximately £lB
a week, compared with
approximately £4 in 1938-39.
N.S.W. can claim a fair
share of credit in the expan-
sion, at the end of 1957-58
having 22,270 factories, with
445,390 employees producing
goods worth £1,849,242,000.
A Scottish View
[Extract from the “Scotsman,”
Edinburgh]
'T’he vital importance of the
-*• trend of commodity prices
rarely seems to be realised in
the United Kingdom. Not until
New Zealand or Australia
have to impose the strictest
austerity programmes limiting
imports of British cars and
other semi-luxury goods is any
notice taken of the fact that
wool or wheat prices are down
by 30 per cent, or more on the
year, or that New Zealand
butter is being sold in the
shops here at below cost price.
Perhaps one reason is that
reductions in prices of raw
commodities are so rarely
passed on to any noticeable
extent to, the retail trade and to
the public. The U.K. economy
is too rigid. Prices, like wages,
are designed to rise but not
to fall ; yet the producing
countries themselves have to
make the sharpest adjustment
in their economies, and drastic
curtailment of imports can soon
take toll of full employment
in some industries in the
United Kingdom dependent to
a large degree on Common-
wealth markets.
We have seen in tin how a
“floor” price of £730 per ton
for the metal was held against
all fluctuations until huge
Russian sales of the metal upset
calculations. It was achieved
by use of large sums to buy up
surplus tin for a buffer stock
financed by the interests con-
cerned. With the large measure
of co-operation made possible
by the Commonwealth Eco-
nomic Conferences, possibly
regulation of production and
export of some other leading
Commonwealth commodities
might be considered, now that
the abnormal conditions of the
immediate post-war period
have passed.


THE SYNTHETICS OGRE
By “FONTAINE”
Amid all the criticisms
and suggestions regard-
ing wool promotion and
the competition of syn-
thetic fibres which have
appeared in the Melbourne
daily press (and presumably in
that of other capital cities) one
all-important factor seems to
have been overlooked. The
general impression gained
from the various press cam-
paigns is that synthetic fibres,
being better promoted than
wool, are overhauling wool and
that unless the growers pull up
their wool socks, the end of
Australia’s greatest primary-
industry will be in sight.
Well, sometimes an incom-
plete picture serves a purpose.
To the extent that the press
barrage has caused the Aus-
tralian Wool Bureau to
announce an entirely new
approach to wool promotion,
and to the extent that Aus-
tralian manufacturers, retailers
and buying public have been
made more wool-conscious, the
results so far are excellent.
But the true picture of “the
Battle of the Fibres” has not
been painted.
T et’s look at the facts.
Rayon was the first artificial
fibre, and in terms of world
production and use it is still the
most important. After the
1914-18 war it went ahead
rapidly. From a mere 33-
million lb. in 1920 world pro-
duction rose markedly year by-
year until by 1954 it had
reached the tremendous total
of 4360-million lb.
Rayon was followed by
nylon, the first of the “newer”
synthetics. Nylon's first and
most spectacular success was
to oust . silk as a fibre for
women’s hosiery and other
garments, but it also has
other important apparel and
industrial uses. Silk, by the
way, is the only natural fibre
to have been severely affected
by synthetics, but there are
special reasons for this. Any-
how, silk is still doing pretty
well in the luxury and semi-
luxury fields.
After nylon came terylene,
orlon, ardil, dynel and other
chemist-shop fibres, each with
its own special uses and, like
wool, each with its own
advantages and disadvantages.
Total production of all syn-
thetic fibres (other than rayon)
rose from about two-million lb.
in 1938 to 250-million lb. in
1951. Today’s production is
doubtless much higher, but
even so it cannot be other than
small in relation to rayon.
effect has the emerg-
ence and increasing use of
all these fibres had on wool pro-
duction and consumption? At
first glance it might be
assumed that wool’s demand
must have fallen appreciably ;
that where synthetics have
come in wool must have gone
out. But the facts are other-
wise.
World wool production
between 1934-35 and 1938-39
averaged 3788-million lb.,
greasy, a year. In that period,
wool met rayon competition
only. From 1938 on it met the
challenge of rayon and all the
other synthetics so successfully
that the estimated world wool
production for 1957-58 is
5020-million lb., greasy— 1
per cent, short of the all-time
record of the previous year.
In fact, in the 12 years from
1946-47 to 1957-58 total pro-
duction rose by 33 per cent.,
the Australian increase being
47 per cent.
Wool-use statistics reflect
these figures year by year,
allowing for the periodical
vicissitudes of production. It
is sufficient to say that world
use of wool for 1957 has been
estimated by the Common-
wealth Economic Committee at
2855-million lb., clean a
consequent all-time record,
which is not bad for an
industry supposed by some to
be a little weak in the legs. So
we find that despite the con-
tinual increase in the produc-
tion of a variety of artificial
fibres, much more wool is
being produced and used than
ever before.
This seeming paradox is
explained by the increase in
the world's population the
vital factor which seems to
have been overlooked in the
daily-paper discussions. World
population is increasing at a
remarkable rate. Latest United
Nations figures show an in-
crease of 47-million persons a
year. Consequently, every year
—every day, in fact—there are
many bodies to be clothed,
adequately or inadequately,
with textiles made from some
kind of fibre. Indeed, without
synthetics large numbers of
people would be half-clothed
or unable to buy the range of
garments they now possess,
for there are simply not enough
natural fibres to go round.
Their shortage in relation to
population is emphasised by
the fact that in the last 35
years or so world production
of all fibres, natural and
artificial, has almost doubled.
Whatever the local position
may be, no evidence has been
adduced to show that wool's
comparatively low price to-
day is the result of a sudden
and unprecedented upsurge of
world-wide competition by
synthetics manufacturers. No
such evidence can b; furnished,
because the reason is entirely
different. Present wool .prices
are a reflex of the American
recession, which has adversely
affected prices of other world
commodities as well. No
responsible reviewer would
blame rayon competition for
the fact that during the de-
pression the average Australian
wool price reached a “low” of
B|d. a pound. Wool will
recover as U.S. industry
recovers.
V|7e come back to the popu-
lation question. No ana-
lysis of the overall wool-syn-
thetics position which ignores it
can be regarded as sound. It is
the crux of the matter. It
explains the remarkable rise in
production and use of syn-
thetics, side by side with a
marked increase in wool pro-
duction and use ; and it indi-
cates clearly that in the future
more artificial fibres and more
wool and more cotton (pro-
vided more is produced) will be
used throughout the world.
There will be plenty for every-
body. It is the story of gas
and electricity over again.
I am no propagandist for
artificial fibres, but 1 must say
that the creation and con-
tinuous parading of an ogre
called Synthetics, bent on the
economic ruin of Australia and
the reduction of its workers
to the status of wood-and-
water joeys, has been slightly
overdone of late. Nevertheless,
the ogre should be kept handy
for use on appropriate occa-
sions ; it helps to keep every-
one concerned up to the mark.

Operatic Occasion
[From Herbert Holman, London]
“Lucia di Lammermoor,”
which is to the operatic
soprano what “Hamlet” is to
the actor and “Giselle” to the
ballerina, has suffered a long
period of disfavor in England.
From 1866 onwards it
appeared in the Covent Garden
repertory for 23 successive
seasons, with Melba as Lucia
for the last 12 years of this
period. Tettrazini came over
in 1907 with triumphant
success, but after 1909 the
opera was dropped, except for
the fiasco of 1925, when, with
dal Monte in the role, the work
was withdrawn after one
performance. Audiences of 25
years ago, it is said, preferred
the dramatic verities to vocal
gymnastics and “singer’s
operas.”
The current performance at
Covent Garden brilliantly
avoids prima-donna showings-
off. Franco Zeffirelli, the 35-
year-old producer, has also
designed the scenery and
costumes. His direction is
imaginative, thorough and
pertinent to the drama, while
his scenery of baronial rugged-
ness combines bleak Victorian
romanticism with Italian soft-
ness of outline.
The resultant mood superbly
fits the opera and, with other
touches, imparts depth and
substance where needed. For,
to be honest, Donizetti's music
is uneven, suggesting that after
providing well for his singers
he couldn’t be bothered to take
pains over the orchestral score.
The dramatic shape, too, is
inclined to be flaccid.
These considerations are im-
portant. Anything less well
conceived might have con-
firmed the 1925 opinion. In-
stead, Zeffirelli and the 81-
year-old maestro Tullio Serafin
(who conducted Melba’s Lucia
in Paris in 1907) have proved
the worth of this opera, always
provided that a soprano equal
to the exacting demands of
Lucia is available.
That this was so is now
musical history. A 31-year-old
Australian, Joan Sutherland,
who had been in the company
for seven years, who had lately
sung Pamina, Gilda, and Des-
demona and who sometimes
had seemed awkward on the
stage, sprang to overnight
fame, bringing not-unneeded
glory to Covent Garden, where,
like Patti and Albani and
Sembrich and Melba and Pon-
“You Wouldn't believe it—the hypnotist had a bloke
suspended just like this!"
selle and Tetrazzini and Callas,
she is now honored by the
dropping of her Christian-
name.
The occasion was romantic
in many ways. Full houses,
attracted by the new star,
bravo’d and called her back
after the Mad Scene in the third
act. Offers poured in from the
world’s opera-houses and from
the recording companies. But,
most of all, it was romantic
because the singer who pro-
mised so well was seen to have
found complete and assured
maturity.
The technical requirements
are staggering. To sing the
part and no more is beyond
the power of all but a few.
But Lucia must also look
young, have a strong character
(Hamlet rather than Ophelia),
be able to move as well as to
act and have the physical and
mental strength to sustain the
long role. If Sutherland’s act-
ing is sufficient technically, her
singing is inspired: the voice
that has always sounded un-
usually pure now expresses
emotion and foreboding
tragedy. The performance is
unified and whole.
The theatre, particularly to-
day, is so prone to accepting
sensationalism or once-for-all
talent as a substitute for art
that it is a delight to record a
success which is a‘direct reward
of consistent and devoted
work. Miss Sutherland’s story
is more than this, since the
credit for her prowess is
shared by her husband,
Richard Bonynge. They were
both students in Sydney. In
1950 he came to London. She
followed a year later, after
having won two awards for
her singing.
Mr. Bonynge told me that
they work together “on roles
every day” and that though
Lucia represents the fulfilment
of maturity they are “both
surprised at the happenings.”
This maturity has, however,
“been coming for a very long
time.” Miss Sutherland was
trained as a Wagnerian
soprano, but found that her
voice was not so restricted.
Its wider range turned them
to early-19th-century dramatic
roles Rossini, Bellini and
Donizetti —and they decided to
study this period.
Asked what advice he could
give to Australians keen to
become operatic singers, Mr.
Bonynge said they “mustn’t be
too ambitious too early.” There
are many young Australians,
he said, with beautiful natural
voices. They must be content
with small things for a long
time and not hope to become
a star overnight. Acquire a
technique slowly. Don’t
attempt the difficult roles
certainly not Lucia or Wag-
nerian ones until past 30.
Similarly, Traviata, Trovatore
and Carmen. Finally, avoid
the greatest danger of all—*
singing too much.
As to future plans, they
“can’t decide what to do next,
so many offers are coming in.”
They look upon Covent
Garden as their home, but it
is certain that Miss Sutherland
will appear as guest-artist in
opera-houses in other countries.
She is soon to record the first-
act aria and the Mad Scene
from “Lucia.” Her success,
too, will undoubtedly en-
courage the revival of other
operas of the same period. One
day, assuredly, we shall have
an equally memorable
“Norma.”

Norman Carter
One very pleasant experience
at the retrospective exhibition,
“A Lifetime of Paintings,” by
Norman Carter at Farmer s
Blaxland Galleries, Sydney,
was to meet Hugh McCrae
again in one of the pencil-
drawings, sitting up as large
as life—or a little larger, as
Hugh always was —and ready
to burst out either into a lyric
or the roar of laughter which
was his comment on all the rest
of life.
It is not a great exhibition,
but, in its distant affinities with
Gruner, Heysen, Lambert and
Longstaff, it recalls some great
and spacious days in Aus-
tralian painting; and every
now and again, when the artist
gets above his average, there
are sound works in the many
categories which he attempted :
the forceful portrait of Lloyd
Rees, for example, which, like
the drawing of McCrae, has
a historic value ; or the large,
bold, vigorous portrait of “The
Squatter” in the posterlike
style which Lambert brought
back from England ; or such
slighter but livelier portraits as
“The Bloke” and “The
Refugee.” Also such land-
scapes as “Milking Time,”
which recalls a Gruner, or the
green foliage of “Our Gully,”
or the flatter, more typical
pieces like “Wilde’s Meadow,”
with their quiet colors and the
charm of the open country.

Spacemen
A dozen or so “advance-
guard” Sydney painters, flying
off like spacemen into the peri-
lous and stimulating realms of
the abstract, submit a report on
their travels in an exceptionally
lively show at the Clune
Galleries, King’s Cross.
So far as this exhibition
indicates it was chosen by
Hal Missingham as representa-
tive of the best work in this
field at the moment
seems to be a turning-away
from the turgidity, pretentious-
ness and mere crudity which
disfigure so many abstracts,
and a concentration on the
charm, sometimes the drama,
of color and design: which,
of course, is the point where
abstraction and realism, so
often mistakenly thought to
be opposed and separate
categories of art, meet.
This commentator cannot
find much sweetness and light
in the huge, shiny cartoons of
Bob Dickerson, in the black
draughts-boards of Gilliland
(who has said more subtle
dusky things in .watercolor),
nor in Coburn’s elementary
designs and colors ; but there
is no doubt about the flair of
Thomas Gleghorn’s “Noc-
turne” and “Summer Land-
scape” ( departure into cheer-
ful crimsons), the force of
Hodgkinson’s heavier “Abyss”
or the curious haunting quality,
both in theme and design, of
Hessing’s “-The Mooncharmer”
—which, if it wasn’t painted by
an aboriginal or an Aztec,
might well have been done by
a little green man from the
moon.

Bequest Purchases
An enormous carpet, 35ft.-by
lift., is among recent Felton
Bequest purchases at the
National Gallery, Melbourne.
It has been provided with a
dais and a staircase so that it
can be viewed from above by
its owners, the general public.
Having been woven by
ancient Persian craftsmen, it is,
of course, a thing of beauty ;
and having been given by
Phillip IV of Spain to the Con-
vent of the Triniarias des
Calzas, Madrid, it has historic
interest; but it is difficult to
know how the gallery is to
display it.
It can’t be laid on the floor
for the hoi-polloi to tread on,
and if hung it would occupy
at least 400 square-feet of wall-
space, and a few more pictures
would have to join the Greek
Aphrodite and other treasures
in the gallery’s storehouses.
Retired director Daryl Lind-
say says the gallery’s vaults,
because they aren’t properly
air-conditioned, are unsuited
for the storing of delicate
things like pictures, and the
deterioration in his day was
tremendous.
Another purchase is the vast
“Finding of Moses,” by
Sebastian Ricci, a minor
master, which cost £3750;
compared to the £220,000
recently paid in London for a
Cezanne, this is cheap in terms
of money—it may or may not
be cheap in terms of artistic
value. The question does arise,
however, as to whether the Be-
quest’s advisers are advising
altogether wisely.
A few more thousands were
spent on the acquisition of a
dozen moderns, including a
Jack Smith for £328. In
monetary terms a Jack Smith at
£328 compares favorably with
the £47,000 paid for the
Rembrandt self - portrait;
but whereas the Rembrandt to-
day would probably fetch
£lOO,OOO or even double, it is
much to be feared that 50
years hence the Jack Smith
won’t fetch twopence.

Old Faces
There are so many old faces
in an exhibition at Melbourne
Athenaeum —the canvases come
from the Artlovers Gallery in
Sydney—that it resembles a
show of the 1910’s or ’3o’s
rather than the 1950’5. A
sensitive study of sweet-peas
by Max Meldrum is most note-
worthy. A Blamire Young
hasn’t been seen in Melbourne
for a long time, but here he is
represented by “Passing
Shower” and “Old Castle,
Canary Islands.” Other names
which were once household
words and are now memories
are George Lambert, W. B.
Mclnnes, Harold Herbert, W.
D. Knox, Sir Arthur Streeton,
Elioth Gruner, Sir John Long-
staff, Lister Lister and Sydney

A Chinese Painter
At first sight the scroll-
paintings hanging at the Com-
monwealth Bank, Melbourne,
might be taken for Chinese Old
Masters. They are, in fact, by
C. C. Wang, from Chekiang
Province, China, who is a
graduate of the National Fine
Arts College, Hangchow, and
who designed the Chinese

International Trade Fair.
In form the paintings are as
traditional as may be —ducks
under reeds, eagle and pine,
chrysanthemums and cock,
bird and pomegranate, and so
forth. With a few swift strokes
of pen or brush Mr. Wang
creates the illusion of a fish
swimming or a cock crowing,
and mostly he does it very well.
Closer inspection, however,
shows something _ lacking.
Something has crept in which
sullies the first impression the
traditional Chinese artist
always sought. “I don’t paint,
I look,” was the classical
dictum. Possibly Mr. Wang’s
academy teaches painting more
than looking. “Plum Blossom,”
however, is altogether charm-
ing.

been a great film. It isn’t.
But it is a very good one.
Trevor Howard plays the
man who is obsessed with pre-
venting the slaughter of ele-
phants for sport and commerce
because he sees them as sym-
bols of; a strength, a gentleness
and a freedom which are dying
in the world. He starts by
badgering the authorities to
legislate against the hunters,
lobbying prominent people,
handing petitions round. As
indifference and ridicule drive
him to more positive opposition
he gathers followers —first a
world-weary prostitute (Juliette
Greco) and a drunken ex-Army
type with a shameful secret
(Errol Flynn); then a couple of
disillusioned academics and an
African nationalist who tries
to use the campaign to advance
his party—and they trail about
the country, frightening people
away from the herds.
Howard holds the hero’s
character in tight, bold out-
line ; but the others are all
from stock, their motives palely
examined.
Their enemies, on the other
hand, are overdrawn to the
point of burlesque. In such
company Orson Welles’s sketch
of a megalomaniac TV-
journalist and Eddie Albert’s
scoop - crazed news - photo-
grapher shine out.
Huston gives this material
his usual broad treatment,
which, though it sometimes
billows around and away from
the story like a colorful skirt,
is generally striking and never
loses the theme’s strongly
appealing flavor. The frighten-
ing irony of the climax —with
the men fighting childishly
while the elephants stampede to
safety ranks with the best
things Huston has done.
“Bell, Book and Candle”
James Stewart and Kim
Novak team in this comedy
about witchcraft versus
normality. Stewart is the man
who, on the eve of his wedding,
decides to marry Kim, secret
expert on the occult.
Stewart shines as an accom-
plished lover, although Tech-
nicolor tends to accent his age.
Kim is, as always, a slightly
cool but alluring opposite.
Jack Lemmon adds freshness
in his portrait of the happy-
go-lucky assistant to Ernie
Kovacs, who plays an author
struggling successfully to write
a book on witchcraft.
Hermione Gingold adds an
engaging picture of a shrewd,
lovable senior witch who
steers the Stewart-Novak
romance to a successful climax.

“Rally Round the Flag,
Boys”
This . tedious domestic
comedy deals with the tribu-
lations of a young husband in
handling a .wife dedicated to
civic service and a slinky siren
who forms the base of the
inevitable triangle.
The humor throughout is
heavy-footed, and even the
usual hotel-bedroom scene —
with husband running around
in underpants and siren “escap-
ing” in diaphanous whatnots as
wife arrives unexpectedly—
fails to rouse more than a
faint grin.
Subtlety of timing is
apparently unknown to the
three principals: Paul New-
man, whose contribution con-
sists mostly in raising his eyes
to heaven in mock despair J
Joanne Woodward, whose true
forte is drama; and Joan
Collins, as the siren, who seems
to be a total stranger to
comedy.
A secondary theme is
formed by the U.S. Army’s
determination to override a
small town’s protests against
the establishing of a secret pro-
ject nearby; and Jack Carson,
as a bulldozing captain, makes
heavy going of it.

his famous 12 labors and
accompanying Jason in the
search for the Golden Fleece.
The chief feature of the
last adventure is a horde of
Amazons in three-inch skirts
who talk through their noses
and gambol with the young
heroes while an unseen choir
of Hollywood angels does its
stuff.
At Sydney St. James.
“The Line-up”
This, at Melbourne Majestic,
is about an international
narcotics-ring and its breaking-
up by two dour-faced ’Frisco
detectives.
Involved in the ring are
innocent tourists who buy
Chinese gods in Hong' Kong
antique-shops, unaware that
inside the said gods is stuffed
a fortune in heroin, which the
ring collects by violent
means, if necessary —on the
ship’s arrival in ’Frisco.
One such tourist is a lonely
lady with a small daughter who
is pursued by two poker-faced
ring-members who, in turn, are
pursued by a horde of police-
men, who, in turn, were pur-
sued by the breathless interest
of the present commentator.
The drugmen pile the lady
and her daughter into their car,
and a staggering chase through
the most respectable parts of
’Frisco ends on the edge of an
unfinished concrete causeway.
The crooks shoot one another
or get shot by the police, and
their terrified victims fall into
the welcoming arms of an
urbane policeman.

by Robert Taylor, who, as a
legal kite with a talent for
getting gangsters out of various
raps, is the apple of the big
shot’s eye.

awakening love, causes the
snide attorney to stack-up

course, and the big shot comes
to the usual sticky end.

who as a purveyor of con-

COLUMN
Blue Metal Industries, Ltd.
r T"'HE group of quarry interests and
allied concerns headed by the Sydney-
registered Blue Metal Industries, Ltd.,
has made particularly good progress over
the past decade, and, if last month’s
announcement of a lift in the div.-rate
is any guide, the group is, at least, holding
its own in the current term. Payable to
members on the register on the third of
this month, the interim div. will be at
the rate of p.c. p.a., the total payout
having been calculated on a 10 p.c. basis
in each of the last three years.
Formed as a holding-co. in 1952, Blue
Metal Industries acquired the share-
capital of the then 31-year-old N.S.W.
Associated Blue Metal Quarries, Ltd.,
the new parent co. exchanging five ss.
ords. for each £1 pref. in the operating
co. and four ss. ords. for each 10s. ord.
The group keeps much of the incidental
trade associated with quarrying and
roadmaking within the family, sub-
sidiary cos. including:
N.S.W. Associated Blue Metal Quarries
Pty.
Sydney and Suburban Blue Metal
Quarries Pty.
Blue Metal Quarries Pty.
Federal Blue Metal Quarries Pty.
Peat’s Ridge Blue Metal Co. Pty.
(These cos. work quarries in various parts
of N.S.W. to produce blue-metal aggregate
and road-base.)
Nepean Sand and Gravel Co. Pty.
Quarries Pty.
(River gravel, crushed aggregate and sand
from deposits on the Nepean River.)
Mobile Plant Pty. (Haulage contractor.)
Transport Industries Pty. (Plant-
maintenance for group and outside
customers.)
Howard Engineering Pty. (Construction
and maintenance of heavy quarry-plant,
general engineering.)
Bituminous Pavements Pty. (Manufac-
turers of pre-mixed bituminous macadam,
road- and pavement-contractor.)
Prospect Equipment Pty. ( Buying-agents
and suppliers of quarry equipment.)
Blue Metal and Gravel Pty. ( Selling-agent
for the metal- and gravel-cos.)
Over £1,000,000 was put into fixed
assets during the 1956 and 1957 terms,
the outlay covering a second bituminous
hot-mix plant and additional crushing-
plant at the Prospect quarry. To help
finance these extensions, fresh capital was
raised (one-for-three, at par) halfway
through 1957, giving 8.M.1. an all-ord.
paid capital of £1,583,016.
A tapering-off in capital-expenditure
last term cleared the way for the increase
in the div.-rate and left the group with
a sound and comfortable financial struc-
ture. Subsidiary cos. balance at June
30, the parent co. closing its books three
months later:

Provision for depreciation exceeded
last term’s expenditure on fixed assets by
£95,128, and, with a shade more than
half of the earnings retained in the busi-
ness, the group was able to eliminate
a £129,987 overdraft, carry considerably
heavier book-debts (up £107,668) and
show working-capital at a healthy
£432,424 (up £269,025).
There was a small slip in sales of
gravel and aggregate during the year to
June 30 last but the programme of plant-
replacement and -modernisation appears
to have paid-off in the form of lower
operating-costs, while those offshoots not
directly engaged in the production of
aggregates, etc., again made a “substan-
tial contribution” to the overall result.
As claimed, group earnings have risen
by 50 p.c. over the past three years and,
although a higher provision for deprecia-
tion (up £73,860, at £322,376) kept pre-
tax earnings £2217 below those of the
previous term, a smaller provision for
tax (down £20,655, at £208,404) left last
term’s net earnings £18,438 stronger at
£332,395. However, the tax-provision was
more in line with declared earnings than
it had been in the two preceding terms,
the 1956 figure indicating a tax-paid
profit of over £360,000:

1958 .. 332,395 10 = 158,302 174,093 548,982
The £332,395 profit represented an
earning-rate on share-capital of 20.9 p.c.,
compared with 22.6 p.c., on average
capital, in 1957, 24.9 p.c in 1956 and
18.4 p.c. in 1955.
Since the announcement of the higher
div.-rate bids for the parent co.'s ss.
ords. (which had sold at up to 11s.
lOd. in January of this year) have
jumped from around 10s. 9d. to 12s.
9d., the scrip at 12s. 9d. cum div.,
giving an effective yield of 50s. 6d.
p.c. from a 12j- p.c. distribution.
At this price the eamings-yield on last
term’s figures would be no more than
moderately attractive at 8.4 p.c., but, as
one of N.S.W.’s major suppliers of
materials basic to roadmaking and, with
cement, to concrete constructions
generally, the co. should continue to find
scope for profitable expansion.
The reinvestment of a substantial pro-
portion of earnings has quite quickly
lifted visible reserves well above the
£401,831 of intangibles (goodwill on con-
solidation), the consolidated accounts
giving the ss. ords. a net tangible cover
of 6s. 9d.
Marcus Clark & Co., Ltd.
HThe ill wind of competition is blowing
shareholders of Marcus Clark and
Co. nothing that’s any good ; and en-
forced rural economies are more and
more diluting the traditional mail-order
trade. The odds seem to favor a further
lowering of the dividend-rate in the
current year.
The chairman himself holds out the
prospect of another difficult trading year.
A- major difficulty, he points out, is the
increasing demand for long-term credit,
and the drift away from cash sales.
Marcus Clark has, of course, long been
conversant with the cash-order type of
finance, but possibly because of an un-
fortunate experience 30 years ago when
the depression found a whole stack of
unsubstantial t.-p. debtors on the books,
the board is wary of any large-scale line
of credit. Unfortunately, the current of
the times seems to be against them.
Nerve-centre of this home-furnishing
and general-retailing group is a rather
imposing edifice gracing Sydney’s other-
wise nondescript Central Square, a locale
which lacks the 100 p.c. selling-qualities
of, say, Market Street. It is doubtful
whether the recent unpopular substitu-
tion of bus services for tram travel along
George Street will add anything to exist-
ing custom.
A- stone’s-throw along the road, in
Broadway, is a scaled-down version of
the parent, Bon Marche, Ltd., a public
company in which Marcus Clark holds
the entire ordinary capital, £125,000.
This store is really in the slough of
despond, and its 1958 net profit didn’t
even match-up to the requirements of the
£lOO,OOO of p.c. prefs. No improve-
ment is forecast for the 1958-59 term
(which ended with the closing of accounts
on January 30).
But some of the further-flung outposts
are showing rather more elan. Very good
reports are coming in from Miller
Anderson, Ltd., the South Australian

representative, which has stores in
Adelaide and Clare and most of whose
£221,000 of ord. capital is kept within
the family. Miller Anderson earned 15
p.c. on its ord. capital during 1957-58.
Better has been done in the past, but
growing-pains have kept down, the earn-
ing-rate over the past year or so. (Miller
Anderson’s balance-date is January 31,
whereas that of the parent is August 2.)
The group also holds a bridgehead
on the north Side of Sydney Harbor
through its subsidiary Hobsons Pty.,
\yhich is holding its ground in the face
of alterations and additions to premises.
Possibly the recently-completed Wollon-
gong branch-store has been showing the
best results, with sales last year higher
by 53 p.c.; but, as an offset, there was
a decided drift in the amount of business
recorded by the Dubbo and Newcastle
branches, in sympathy with the fall in
rural incomes and the rising unemploy-
ment on the northern coalfields.
Consolidating the experiences of the
individual member-companies, net profit
for the year slipped by £6122. Profit
before tax and depreciation was £246,585,
compared with £248,881 in 1957, and
appropriations of £47,306 (£39,864) for
depreciation ; £75,571 (£79,281) for taxa-
tion ; and £22,967 (£22,873) attributable
to outside (mostly pref.) shareholders,
left as net earnings £100,741 (£106,863).
Member preference-shareholders claimed
£37,367 of this, leaving £63,381 as profit
for the ordinaries, which in turn gives an
earning-rate of 10.6 p.c. on issued ordi-
nary capital:

The last round of new equity-capital
came by way of a one-for-two par-issue
of ords. in October, 1955, being the first
such for many a long year.
Share-lists are currently showing a
yield of 7.7 p.c. at 10s. 4d. a stock-unit
on the basis of an 8 p.c dividend, but
investors would be wise to budget for
something less than this.
Lamson Paragon Industries, Ltd.
A leading figure in the commercial-
stationery, office - equipment and
allied fields, the Lamson Paragon orga-
nisation has given shareholders little
cause for complaint ever since it first
led the public into the business back
in 1910.
Since then, there has been an unin-
terrupted run of profits, with 1930 as the
only year in which the board failed to
recommend a dividend, the div.-rate
averaging a shade over 10.2 p.c. for the
20 years to 1956.
Earnings and share-capital were ex-
panded at a really brisk rate over the
10 years following the 1939-45 war, a
one-for-12 bonus-issue in 1945 preceding
cash-issues in 1947 (one-for-two, at a
25 p.c. premium), 1949 (two-for-five, at
a 40 p.c. premium) and 1951 (one-for-
two, at a 40 p.c. premium). Gift-scrip
went out again in 1951, on a one-for-five
basis, while the formation of Lamson
Paragon Industries, Ltd., in 1957 in-
volved, in effect, the capitalisation of
goodwill by a one-for-one bonus-issue.
This issue gave the new parent co. its
present paid capital of £1,419,000 and
led to a reduction in the div.-rate from
12| p.c. to 7 p.c.
Equal to 14.6 p.c. on capital in 1946,
net earnings had risen to 22 p.c. on a
capital nearly four times the 1946 figure
by 1955. However, despite an improve-
ment of almost 30 p.c. in gross earnings
over the next three years, net profit has
remained more-or-less static, due, largely,
to increased selling and administrative
costs. And, as short-term sharemarket-
interest hinges around the prospects of a
lift in the div.-rate, the latest accounts
don’t appear to call for any marked
increase in the support at present
accorded to the scrip.
As a long-term holding the 10s. ords.
have distinct possibilities at 14s. but, on
last term’s results, the immediate earn-
ings-yield at this price would be an
unexciting 7.4 p.c., the div.-yield from
a 7 p.c. distribution working-out at an
even 5 p.c.

Trading conditions over the year to

cult” than those experienced in the pre-
ceding year but turnover (undisclosed)
doesn’t appear to have suffered unduly,
gross earnings growing by £58,871 to

general-expenses of £584,816 (up £64,212)

"C 1 xtrapolation of the trend
shown in the profit-table
indicates, anything but a
lustrous future for this Sydney
furnisher and financier. R. H.
Gordon pioneered householder-
credit in New South Wales,
but, like Peter Pan, it just
failed to grow-up.
The cash-order system of
financing tends these days to
be displaced by other modes
such as hire-purchase and
home-grown budget accounts,
and Gordon’s quasi-currency
is no longer the passe-partout
it once was.
Increased competition and
buyer-resistance is also evident,
in the furniture side of the
business, and turnover has
been declining steadily, while
costs have been rising.
After providing £16,390 for'
income tax, as against £lB,OOO
in 1956-57, plus a trifle for
depreciation, net profit slipped
from £33.,414 to £30,633. More
significantly, pre-tax profit fell
from £51,414 to £47,023. The
earning-rate on capital was
12.7 p.c., as against 22.4 p.c,
five years ago ; and the divi-

R. H. Gordon hasn’t gathered
much financial moss since
the days of its greatest
glory back in the ’twenties,
but this can be put down to a
very open-handed dividend-
policy. Dividends - averaged
18.7 p.c. for the 18 years to
1930, 12.6 p.c. for the next 10,
13.3 p.c. over the five war-
years to 1945, 19.3 p.c. for the
next five, and since .1950, 13.9

Faith in the
Future
In recent months I have met and talked with
leading bankers in Britain and Europe, and
conferred with some of America’s top industrialists.
It enabled me to assess the new approach to
banking finance in other parts of the world.
And I have come back more than ever con-
vinced that Australia will have to take the bold,
imaginative course in its financing, both public and
private, for the future.
Let us take that up from the human angle.
Here, because of higher proportions in the younger
age-groups, we have a work-force increasing at a
greater rate than the rise in population.
This means that our expansion will be getting
more than an ordinary impetus in the next
ten years.
But it also means that extra calls will have
to be met for such services as education and
housing, as well as for the basic requirements of
roads, power, water,- and so on.
It follows from this that there will have to be
a due balance between public and private
investment. Work-providing industries must be
encouraged and expanded. There can be no
starving of enterprise in a growing economy.
So, while applauding the energetic drives being
made for trade and for investment in Australia, I
think we should admit that something more than the
conventional thinking of the past is required to meet
the financial needs of Australia in the future.
There are two points emerging from this
which I think we should recognise at once:
First is the need for some review of the system
under which revenue and loan funds are allocated
as between Governments. That seems to be
essential to ensure a better, and nationally wiser,
distribution of funds for public works.
And, just as importantly, the changes taking
place in banking methods overseas should be
thoroughly understood and intelligently applied
here, to assist the more fluid use of funds for private
investment.

Mary Kathleen Uranium
TTavjng got the Mary Kath-
leen uranium-mine into
production well ahead of
schedule, Mary Kathleen
Uranium, Ltd., has begun to
knock-up profits on a scale
comparable with that envis-
aged by speculators in the
uranium-boom of 1954. The
cost of the project—a factor
sometimes overlooked when
the uranium-fever was raging
—has fallen within estimates,
the total funds employed by
the co. at December 31 last
exceeding £13,400,000.
The first production-ore
began its course through the
treatment-plant on Juiie 3 last,
nine months ahead of the dead-
line under M.K.U.’s £4O-
- contract with the U.K.
Atomic Energy Authority, and
for the 1 seven months to De-
cember 31 net profit was
reckoned at £1,417,266. This
is equal to annual rate of
over £2,425,000, or more than
340 p.c. on the £710,460 share-
capital. No provision was
made for depreciation or
amortisation.
As M.K.U. has agreed to
match dividend-payments with
equai repayments on the more
than £9 million of loan-money
outstanding at the end of last
term, no more than half of
the profits will be available for
dividends for some years to
come. Of last term's earnings,
£708,000 was transferred to a
special repayments-reserve, and
appropriations corresponding
with repayments will be made
in future years.
Even allowing for the loan-
commitments, there should be
no difficulty in covering
annual tax-free divs. of at
least 100 p.c., the rate sug-
gested last year when 150,000
2s. 6d. shares were placed on
the market at 255. The first
div. from the co. is expected
later this year.
The cash-surplus on comple-
tion of the contract, and the
repayment of loans, was esti-
mated at 31s. Bd. a share at
the time of the placement,
and, as the 4500 tons of
uranium-oxide to be supplied
to the U.K. authority may be
delivered by the end of 1965,
an average annual surplus of
4s. 6d. a share is indicated for
the seven-year period to 1965.
The public holding in
M.K.U. is limited to the
150,000 shares mentioned
above, but shareholders in
Mary Kathleen Investments,
Ltd., have an indirect interest
through their co.’s 35 p.c.
holding in M.K.U.
One ss. share in the M.K.I.
represents a little over two-
thirds of a 2s. 6d. share in
M.K.U., and although the
sharemarket naturally prefers
the direct interest, the M.K.I.
scrip still looked a cheaper
proposition last week at around
Jss. 6d., the M.K.U. shares
selling at up to 28s. 6d.
Rio Tinto has a 51 p.c.
interest in M.K.U. (as well as
a holding in M.K.1.), and the
Walton-McConachy syndicate,
the original discoverers of the
deposit, a 9 p.c. interest, asso-
ciates of Rio Tinto and the
public each holding approxi-
mately 2y p.c. of the issued
capital.
During the year to Decem-
ber 31 last M.K.U. took
232,000 (short) tons of ore
and 341,000 tons of waste
material from the North
Queensland open-cut to show
an ore-to-waste ratio of 1:1.5.
Operating for the last seven
months of the term, the mill
treated 226,000 tons of ore,
with a head-assay of 3.071 b.
per ton, for 562,0001 b. of
uranium-oxide. Overall re-
covery of mill head-values was
86.3 p.c.
The value of the oxide pro-
duced, less realisation costs,
was £2,566,818, indicating a
selling-price close to the
£lO,OOO a ton suggested by
earlier reports. A small
premium is payable on oxide
delivered during the first few
years of the contract.
Mining, milling, administra-
tive and other costs totalling
£1,149,552 (or approximately
£5500 per ton of oxide pro-
duced) were covered before
arriving at the £1,417,266 net
profit. As might be expected,
initial operating-costs were
higher than those anticipated
in future years but, against
this, overall costs were reduced
by the capitalisation of “sub-
stantial amounts” of interest,
etc.
A calculation of ore reserves
at the end of the year con-
firmed that the tonnage of
oxide in the orebody was
“appreciably” greater than that
required to complete the con-
tract with the U.K. authority.
(Earlier last year, recoverable
ore reserves were estimated at
6,600,000 tons averaging
0.143 p.c. uranium-oxide. On
last term’s recovery-ratio this
would yield around 8150 short
tons of oxide.)
By December 31, M.K.U.
had spent £9,419,676 on con-
struction-work, plant, build-
ings, mining-leases, etc. A
further £3,055,480 being repre-
sented by current assets (includ-
ing ore- and oxide-stocks of
£2,253,831) and £987,532 by
exploratiomcosts and mine-
development. Long-term loans
amounted to £9,228,074 pf
which £7,041,774 was owing to
the U.K. authority and
£2,106,300 to Rio Tinto. Cur-
rent liabilities (£2,106,888)
include a £1,680,027 overdraft
which is being repaid “in
accordance with, agreed
arrangements.”
Biggest query surrounding
the investment-value of Mary
Kathleen is, of course, the
probable demand for uranium
on completion of the U.K.
contract. However, fears that
M.K.U. would have only a
brief, if wealthy, career were
discounted by chairman R. B.
Pelly at week’s annual
meeting, the chairman refer-
ring to projected increases in
nuclear generating - capacity
and to the development of
nuclear-powered ships to sup-
port his belief that an “increas-
ing demand for uranium may
become a reality quicker than
was originally anticipated.”
It was generally held, he
continued, that the use of
heavy hydrogen as an alterna-
tive to uranium was unlikely
to reach a significant level
before 1980, while there were
signs that demand for uranium
could outstrip supply by 1970.
Competitive production-costs
should enable the co. to com-
pete successfully in world
markets but, with the extent
and duration of those markets
still a matter for conjecture,
the establishment of a com-
mercial nuclear power-plant in
Australia would be an
encouraging sign.

SALT-DOMES AND OIL
[Discovery of a salt-mass
between 2263 ft. and 4000 ft. in
Frome Rocks No.l well, W.A.,
was a most interesting develop-
ment in the oil search in W.A.
a few weeks ago. Frome Rocks
No. 2, four miles away, is now
at 3918 ft., and geological con-
ditions are said to be quite
different from those in Frome
Rocks No. 1. The following
article is Wapet’s own. com-
mentary on the salt in No. 1
well .]
HPhe unexpected discovery of
a salt-mass in the Frome
Rocks No. 1 well could play
a significant part in the search
for oil in W.A., although much
additional drilling may be
necessary to assess its geo-
logical meaning.
Although such a salt body is
so far unique in W.A., salt-
dome's are found in many
parts of the world, particularly
in the Gulf Coast area of
America, in Western Germany
and in Rumania. In those
countries, and particularly in
Louisiana, U.S.A., the presence
of salt-domes have been asso-
ciated with some exceptionally
prolific oilfields, although not
in themselves productive of
oil.
Among the many types of
oil- and gas-traps, those result-
ing from salt structures are
the most unusual. But in spite
of their odd nature and origin,
a substantial proportion of the
world’s petroleum comes from
salt-core structures.
In addition to oil and gas.
the greater part of the world’s
sulphur and some salt and
potash production are obtained
in association with salt-
deposits.
. Salt - core structures are
classified into two main types.
The first structure is bedded
salt, which has thickened by
plastic flowage but which has
not ruptured the overlying
strata. No oil-deposits of
importance have yet been
found associated with these
structures.
The second type includes
salt-structures which have rup-
tured or extruded through
various strata. The salt-domes
are included in this type.
But while salt-domes can be
directly associated with rich
accumulations of oil, geolo-
gists will hasten to point out
that not all salt-domes are so
happily situated.
The main value of salt-
domes in the field of oil-
discovery is that they provide
the necessary folds in bedded
or stratified geological forma-
tions which could trap oil.
Formation of salt-domes is
relatively simple. They arise
from bed*ded salt, deposited in
an arm of the seat cut-off from
the main ocean by reefs or by
slight changes in sea-level.
Common salt, as well as more
complex salts such, as potash
and gypsum, begin to form
and be deposited by chemical
concentration and precipita-
tion as evaporation of the sea-
water progresses.
As a result of this accumu-
lation, a thick salt-mass may
be formed. To create the
domes, however, there must
“ You've made a wonderful job—it Works splendidly !”
be some earth-movements and
continued sedimentary deposi-
tion which buries the salt to
a great depth—perhaps as
much as 12,000 ft. Under this
pressure the salt-layer becomes
plastic and begins to move,
squeezing upwards to break
through the various deposits
above it. In the process traps
suitable for the accumulation
of oil could be formed.
Occasionally the pressure
will force a body of salt away
from its base deposit. This
body may rise or “float” up-
ward as a tear-drop or pear-
shaped mass with the same
effect upon the layers of sedi-
ment which have been pene-
trated in the process.
Some of these pear-shaped
salt-formations migrate upward
thousands of feet from their
source-bed.
Where the salt breaks
through the sediments, oil may
be trapped either in the over-
lying domed beds or in the
interrupted layers around the
sides of the salt-mass. The
domes also develop “cap
rocks” which, too, have proved
to be prolific producers of oil
as well as sulphur. These con-
ditions are most commonly
found in the Gulf Coast region
of the U.S.A.
The salt-domes in Rumania
are due to squeezing of salt
into folds and along fault-
structures. Their formation is
not as simple as in the Gulf
Coast zone. It is believed that
the salt structure found at
Frome Rocks may have origin-
ated in the same manner as
those in Rumania.
The sediments lying above
the salt-dome are very broken
and disturbed, and the faults
created as a result could be
important in the search for
oil.
The salt-domes which have
been found in the Gulf Coast
region have been located prin-
cipally by gravity - meter
surveys, as salt has a lower
specific gravity than the
enclosing sediments. This
makes them fairly easy of
detection. Seismic methods
are then employed to learn
more details of the structure.
Drilling a salt-dome for oil
can be complicated, as some
50 per cent, of the holes can
be unproductive. However,
the rewards are often sub-
stantial.
Salt-domes, as mentioned
earlier, have no genetic asso-
ciation with oil. But once the
“pay”-zone area near the dome
is known, companies will often
drill directly into the dome
and then side-drill to the pro-
ductive zone. This method is
adopted because it is easy to
drill in the salt.
Salt-ffomes are also import-
ant sources of the world’s
supply of sulphur. How the
sulphur has been formed is not
known, but its extraction is
simple. Bores are drilled as
for oil-production, with super-
heated water pumped down
one string of tubing into the
sulphur, the sulphur and water
emerging from another tube.
A salt structure such as that
found at Frome Rocks could,
therefore, supply either potash
or sulphur, although there has
been no indication as yet of
the presence of either of these
minerals.
Wapet is drilling another
hole within four miles of
Frome Rocks No. 1 well to
test the structure further. [See
introductory paragraph.]


I'm-a-Sorry
By
JACK LUSBY
u-y-’M-A-soRRY,” says Johnnie
this Friday night, and
JL squeezes the trigger.
Between the tall build-
ings the ill-lit laneway seems
to jump in a deafening blast of
sound. Johnnie sees the watch-
man whirl and spreadeagle on
the concrete, hears the clatter
of the watchman's flying pistol.
A split-second affair.
Another shot? No! Even
split-seconds count now.
Johnnie is running, slamming
a car-door, driving. The suit-
case is down by the steering-
column. Just after theatre-
time now. There’s still city
traffic. Probably a good thing.
Nearest exit? North over the
Harbor bridge: Johnnie slows
to pay bridge-toll. No road-
block yet. Soars high in the
great filigree of steel and
swoops to the North Side, cuts
east towards, the beaches. A
couple of miles of shop-lined
road sing under the tyres and
Johnnie swings north again.
Johnnie’s thoughts fly in two
directions. About tonight’s job
—impulsive and premature —
and about the plan forming in
his mind. Johnnie hates any-
thing impulsive, anything but
careful planning; he hates
using his gun. Using a gun can
be dangerous beyond belief.
The way it goes. Everything
a success and almost a clean
get-away—then the watchman
about to shoot.
“I’m-a-sorry,” Johnnie
murmurs unconsciously as the
car hums out of the inner
suburbs. He’s being sorry for
Johnnie.
He wears a white T-shirt and
blue jeans. Crepe-soled pumps.
The leather bag is still down
beside him. Red-hot. Johnnie
is smooth, face and arms
swarthy against the white T-
shirt, plump well-kept hands
relaxed on the wheel, dark
eyes resting on the streaming
highway, flicking to the mirror,
to the side-streets. No turmoil
showing.
The car squelches to a stop
at the kerb. Other cars stand
near comfortable homes, and
there are still some lighted
windows. Ahead, the road
swoops steeply to a flat
triangular spit of land and a
bridge spanning a narrow
reach of harbor. A rising moon
shows yachts, cabin-cruisers
and launches nosed into a light
breeze and riding at rest like
sleeping gulls. Across the
water, road-lights zig-zag up
a shadowed escarpment
rimmed with the silhouetted
battlements of dwellings.
Johnnie studies the
panorama spread below. Then
starts-up and steps on it, and
the scene screws up to meet
him like an airstrip. The plan
in Johnnie’s head, kept there
vaguely for months against a
rainy day, solidifies, becomes
sharp around the edges. He
has watched this place, during
days and nights of fishing from
a dinghy, just in case of
accidents like tonight.
There’s a row of cars parked
in darkness a little way off
the road. They belong to people
out using their boats. Johnnie
rolls his car in beside the
others. Spends time rubbing
off the likely places for prints.
The police have got Johnnie’s,
and they’ll get this car back
soon enough.
T'Vinghies are drawn-up on
the strip of beach like
caught fish. Johnnie dumps the
suitcase in a tiny snubnosed
coracle, and hand-paddles
awkwardly towards the gull-
fleet riding white on the dark
water. Towards a 35-footer
with the lines of a fishing-boat.
Her name amuses Johnnie—
Martini. He ties the coracle
astern and goes nimbly aboard.
Now the Martirti has been
running two hours in the open
sea, tiny in the great, even
shore swell, trailing her white
thread of wake along the wide,
black valleys and on the moon-
tipped crests. She’s running
north, parallel to the long white
scythes of sand and the slow
thump of the surf on -her left.
Occasionally jutting cliffs
like great black battleship-
prows move slowly astern.
Over across the beaches
Johnnie can see flat-strung
street-lights fronting the distant
loom of higher ground. Out
here, a mile from the turbu-
lence, it’s a good sea. Johnnie’s
Martini soars and Skis in the
undulations of a salty prairie.
Johnnie, standing with legs
spread at the wheel, is not
unhappy. Something to do with
a boyhood spent on Mediter-
ranean fishing-boats. The real
hunt will come soon, but
ashore. Madness to stick with
the Martini. In daylight she’ll
be picked up in a flash.
Minutes, now, to the next
move.
Johnnie watches spray ex-
ploding in slow motion against
a towering wall of rock—•
known rock, this. Johnnie
knows it has a reaching reef
and gives it plenty of room ;
comes abreast of the curving
beach beyond.
“Aha!” A determined spin
of the wheel and the nose
comes round. The Martini is
running in on the swell, the
little dinghy trailing like a
frightened pup. Ahead now are
the long black and lacey-
white backs of the breakers,
moonstruck spray smoking
over , the surf, and the beach.
A thing about Johnnie —when
forced to improvise he likes
the cheeky, the unexpected
move.
Almost in to where they’re
cracking, now. Foam in his
face and the stern lifting. Firm
grip and legs braced. Briefly
the world around Johnnie turns
from black to racing, tumbling
white. The suitcase lashed
high near his head smacks him
in the face. For a moment the
Martini tries to run crosswise
in front of the breaker; but
the surf knows its fishing-boats,
and the little craft's nose is
bashed shorewards again.
At the first bump only a
reflex-raised forearm saves
Johnnie from a smashed face.
That arm’s-a gonna be sore!
The boat is lifted and carried


further in. Bump again! The
Martini careens to a standstill
in creeping, flat, expended
breakers.
"Johnnie frees the suitcase,
** picks his moment and goes
overside. Thigh-deep. Splashes
into the shallows, keeping in
the water, strides to the south
end of the beach. Wades up a
shallow creek and steps onto
the clipped grass of the beach
reserve.
It’s well into Saturday morn-
ing but still a good way from
dawn. Johnnie stands and
checks the layout. Seaward
the white, marching terraces of
surf. Here deep moon-
shadows and sighing pines;
landward, a sweep of sleeping
houses, flats and bungalows.
Shoes squelching, trousers
clinging wet to his legs, Johnnie
moves along a palm-lined
street. He’s as lonely as a
homing drunk, and that’s how
he wants to be —for a few
hours. Walking slowly under
the tall palms Johnnie’s plan
turns crystal clear. A short-
range plan. It demands just
one day’s freedom till the
dragnet tangles.
Then another jump. This
other jump? One day's free-
dom will be enough for
Johnnie to work that one out.
Blood-a oath!
The bungalow is set well
back from the road, well apart,
with a black background of
bush. Twisted gums are
allowed to decorate the lawns.
Moonlight filters through the
gums, whitens the blue-tiled
rOof of what looks like a
pretty smart week-ender. Open
garage-space but no cars.
Johnnie walks all round the
bungalow. All modern- angled,
verandas, picture - windows,
drawn blinds.
A locked back door keeps
Johnnie out in the warm night
air for three minutes. A
reading-lamp suddenly spreads
a muted glow in a big baskety-
furnished lounge room. Who's
to worry? Pre-dawn Saturday
morning, and week-end people
mind their own business any-
way. And not much light
through the blinds and curtains.
The room has a polished
Oregon floor with a careless
scatter of high-colored rugs
and cushions.
Johnnie doesn’t think of the
incongruity of Johnnie in these
surroundings. He doesn't
remember the Martini in the
surf. He finds a well-fitted
bathroom. Uses an electric
razor stowed in a cabinet.
Uses hair-cream, brush and
comb, after stripping off the
sodden T-shirt, jeans and
pumps. In the shaving-mirror
now it’s a baby-smooth, bland,
olive face with a hint of shine
on the brushed black hair.
Bird’s-wing brows and spaniel
eyes: Johnnie Giuffrida in
person.
Johnnie leaves the bath-
room as he found it, and back
in the big room opens the suit-
case, takes out a change of
clothing and, after removing
the Colt 45, puts the bodgie
outfit in beside the neat, tight
stack of banknotes. Closes and
locks the suitcase. That small
suitcase is so hot it’s like a
radiator. . .
Relaxing back in a deep cane
chair Johnnie crosses his legs
and lights a smoke from a pack
on a little table. Pulls the table
closer so he can reach the ash-
tray. Lightweight suit, polished
brogues, snowy shirt and
maroon bow-tie.
Johnnie switches off the
lamp beside him, reaches and
slides back a curtain. Dawn
greys the room. Johnnie puts
out his smoke and does some
thinking. Good place to kill
time, this. Too conspicuous to
walk about for hours yet.
Owners not likely to arrive
for hours anyway. The gun?
As much a part of Johnnie as
his manicured right hand. No
question of ridding himself of
the gun. Any more than hiding
the money. No. If this has to
be anything it has to be 100
per cent, deception, with no
searchings or suspicions. All or
nothing—what they say? Syd-
ney or the bush!
The hunt? Hours old in the
city. And as soon as they
connect the hot car with the
stolen Martini the hunt will be
right here. And “here” is a
narrow beach-resort peninsula.
No place to go into smoke or
be furtive. . . be like a flea
v on a monkey’s tail. Still, they’ll
expect him to hide and shoot
it out when cornered. Well,
if they corner Johnnie hell
shoot it out. But Johnnie won’t
hide!
He snaps out of a doze. Sun-
light spears into the room. A
wall clock says 8.45. A phone
is ringing. It rings for three
minutes. Time to go.
Johnnie locks the back door
after him, walks down under
the twisted gums to the palm-
lined street. Over near the
beach cars cluster under the
pines. A little apart, two
police cars. Sunbrowned kids
screeching “Ship-
wreck!” Johnnie turns away
from the beach and walks
along the street, a man with
a destination.
The hotel is rambling and
spacious. Behind it, lawns
and sub-tropical gardens run
down to a smooth stretch of
water. Luxury-craft ride at
their moorings.
On the lawns seats are
grouped round little tables.
There’s a glittering jukebox, a
dancing space and cigarette-
machines. On a four-sided
bungalow-like garden - bar
rests a purple cloud of bougain-
villea. A brown - backed
gardener stoops under a
hibiscus bush. In the bar
under the bougainvillea two
girls chatter and rattle things
about, getting ready for busi-
ness.
Johnnie studies all this from
a veranda, then enters the main
building. There’s a quick clop
of high heels and a girl says
“He’ll see you now.”
The girl has a flaring floral
frock, Johnnie follows her
along a wide hallway. On his
right he sees more girls glitter-
ing-up another bar. Getting
ready for the Saturday
clientele. On his left an exten-
sive stretch of drinking-
lounge.
The manager folds Johnnie’s
ship-steward references and
pushes them back over the
desk. Gives Johnnie a final
scrutiny.
“Yes, we can use a casual,
week-ends, garden-bar. Ask
someone for Frank. He’ll fix
you up.”
Frank has red hair and a
thin bird-face. He’s already in
white jacket, black, trousers and
black tie. After Johnnie leaves
the change-room similarly
attired Frank says “I’m in the
lounge, Johnnie ; anything you
want to know the girls can't
tell you, ask me.”
Henni is a plump little Dutch
doll and should be in white
bonnet and clogs. She’s stack-
ing clean glasses in wire cages.
Jean is tall and lithe and even
with jet hair drawn into a
huge and phoney bun achieves
a Spanish look. Her face is
high cheek-boned and attrac-
tive. Both girls are fixing the
garden bar with manipulative
dexterity a surgeon might envy.
Jean’s lean right hand grips
a gadget like a pistol on a long
plastic hose. She’s firing beer
frothily into a brace of
schooners for the first
customers. Regulars. She has
spotted them, in shorts and
shirts, coming through the
garden. They live on one of the
boats down there. Johnnie
studies all this activity for a
moment or two, then ducks
under a flap and enters the
bar.
“I’m-a Johnnie.” with a
snow-white smile in the smooth
olive face.
“Thank God for that,
Johnnie! We’re flat-out Satur-
days like a lizard drinking.
I’m Jean, this is Henni.”
Henni crinkles blue doll’s
eyes and beams at Johnnie.
They size him up and he
looks okay. Cheerful, confi-
dent and neat as a new pin.
They’ve heard only three words
from Johnnie, but they've
never heard a voice quite the
same. A soft-husky baritone
with a trace of accent. Johnnie
doesn’t know that his voice
would, be an instant hit on
afternoon radio-programmes.
TJe needs little instruction.
Slips into the part without
a ripple. Only new thing the
beer-guns on their snaky
yellow hoses. The beer-guns
intrigue Johnnie.
“You ever shoot beer in da
face of da bad customer?” he
says to Jean.
. “It’s a temptation,” says
Jean. It seems that Henni can
serve drinks and prattle breath-
lessly at he one time. Scraps
begin to register on Johnnie.
“A boat, you know! Up on
za beach! My brotter Hank is
there and see it! And people,
and policemen, and all tumbled
over it is!”
“It was on the radio a few
minutes ago, Henni,” says a
customer in a poinsettia-
patterned shirt. “Stolen. They
don’t know if the bloke’s
drowned or got ashore. Dinghy
still tied on.”
. “Ja? Is that so!”
“Two schooners and a
brandy soda” turns Henni’s
attention to new arrivals.
It’s a careless kaleidoscopic
crowd gathering on the lawns
around the garden bar. Mostly
bare brown skin with a flicker
of flowery fabric where the
women 101 l or stray barefooted
in the sun. The weekending
men bare-legged and bare-
chested. There seem to be
honeymooners by the score
and weekend parties of various
sizes and varying decorum.
The jukebox is in full cry,
crowded by its foot-tapping
and hip-jiggling devotees. From
the boats down on the inlet
come city men revelling in
devil-may-care dress. From
other boats come professional
fishermen, legitimately un-
shaven and ragged after a night
in the open sea.
“Tea is here, Johnnie,” says
Henni.
Johnnie drinks his on the
bar and eats a scone.
“Are there more scones,

Henni?” says Johnnie. He
realises he’s hungry. Very
hungry. And a very hungry
man can’t cope. Henni brings
him six more. She likes
Johnnie.
“Police all over the place,”
comes a voice nearby. “Lookup
at every bastard on the beach,
lookin’ under houses, goin’
•through the bush”
“Manhunt, eh?”
“Tellin’ me! Even spotted
a couple of ’em up in the front
bar a minute ago. Two beers,
mate.”
Johnnie gives them two
beers.
Johnnie remains deft and
deadpan. Finds time to study
the people. They really crowd
the lawns now, festoon the
wide hotel-veranda and flow
inside. The hot sun hangs:-
right overhead. In the parking
spaces cars are packed like
shining beetles.
“They reckon now the feller
that stole the boat is the same
feller bowled that night-
watchman”
“And he’s around here
somewhere and desperate!”
“Prepared to shoot! ”
“Half the women round
here’ve locked their doors.”
“I’d like a swing at the
bastard. . .”
Johnnie concentrates on being
100 per cent, barman. Faultless
with the drinks, faultless with
the change, faultlessly bland
and unconcerned. They’ll be
looking for anything, anyone
out of place. Anything out of
place will screech like a siren.
Tohnnie looks at the people
** who can throw off their
week-day responsibilities and
their clothing and bring to this
place an effervescent air of
carefree hilarity. He looks at
the local men out of place in
their clean white shirts and
unironed slacks. He realises
which of the two types will
be the more dangerous if
Johnnie is cornered.
“Why beach the boat here?”
the chatter goes on.
“Dunno. Probably got sea-
sick. Might even be drowned.
Overboard or something.”
Locals talking.
“The demons don’t think so.
Looking under beds, up hollow
logs.” •
John nie serves them beer,
then finds himself facing two
big hard-eyed men sweating
through their shirts. Hats
pushed back, they look like
men who’ve been taking un-
accustomed exercise. |
Johnnie fills the tall glasses,
slaps down the change.
“Whew!” says one of the
big fellows, fitting a red-hairy
fist around his beer. “Telling
me! Luck,” says his mate.
They turn a pair of bulky
backs to Johnnie and casually
study the crowd. It’s a relief to
hear the Jean-to-Henni natter.
“Believe me, pet, he’s a
phony. I know all about his
boats and cars. And week-
ender! He’s got a weekender
at Woolloomooloo with corru-
gated-iron windows!”
“Ja? Is that so?”
“Same again,” says one of
the big men, turning a sphinx-
stare on Johnnie. Johnnie fires
frothing beer into the glasses
with an uplifted feeling. The
acid-test, this. The detectives
turn away and resume a
murmured conversation. Then
they move away and their place
is taken by three young men
in city clothes. One dumps a
camera on the bar.
“Three beers, Toni.” Cheeky,
but tired like the detectives.
“Begins to look like a
fizzer.”
“Oh, well, here’s hoping.”
The lunch-break comes and
goes, and Johnnie’s really
hoping. At knock-off time his
escape is to be simple, and
seems foolproof.
He’ll collect his pay, change
into his own suit and stand at
the bus-stop like any other
honest toiler, suitcase beside
him. Anyone who recognises
him will recognise him as
Johnnie the new barman. He’ll
ride back to the city in a
crowded bus. And once back
in the city Johnnie knows how
to disappear. The heat will
be cooling there, the dragnet
tangled, and every chance of
a clean getaway. . .
Henni is stooping, reaching
for something under the bar
counter. Johnnie is careless for
a moment and his knee smacks
a rounded rump.
“I hurt you Henni?” Johnnie
says. “Fm-a-sorry.”
“Is nice how you say that,
Johnnie,” says Henni, straight-
ening up and crinkling a
smile. “You do haf a nice
voice.”
“Will you take this to the
front office?” says Jean,
giving Johnnie a bag of change.
Johnnie ntakes his way over
the lawn, past all the warm
bare skin and tinkling cool
drinks, through the tium of
conversation and bursts of easy
laughter.
On the wide veranda two
detectives in careless beach
dress run their eyes over the
crowd. They spare Johnnie a
routine glance. Johnnie
remembers how, years earlier,
his description has been police-
property, press-copy and
broadcast material.
“They’re searching the bush
now on Frigate Hill,” says the
girl in the office to the
manager. “All their guns out
like in a film.”
“It won’t be Hollywood
when they find him.”
“I’m sorry for him. It’s a
fox-hunt. Thanks, Johnnie.”
, She takes the bag of change
and Johnnie goes back to the
garden-bar.
T angorously the day moves
towards sunset. Down on
the inlet the scatter of craft
have turned their white hulls
slightly into a freshening
breeze.
“Six-thirty, Johnnie,” says
leap. “No more beer till seven-
thirty. You knock-off now.
See you next Saturday?”
“Okay, Jean.”
Two of the big men Johnnie
has seen earlier come to the
bar with a companion—-a pale,
oldish fellow with an arm in
a sling.
‘“Three beers, please.”
“No more drinks,” says
Johnnie, resting his smooth
hands on the bar. “I’m-a
sorry.”
“Well, wouldn’t that”
The big man’s comment is
cut short by the old fellow.
Eyes popping, bandaged arm
flapping like a wing, he points
a boney finger at Johnnie.
“I’m-a sorry! I'm-ci' sorry /
That’s how he said it! Then
let me have it. That’s him!”
Johnnie has a split-second
start on the detectives. His
gun is in his hand lined on the
first target in lightning reflex
movement. Aimed blue-black
and deadly at the big expanse
of white shirt.
Then the whole frozen scene
before Johnnie vanishes in a
stinging flood that forces his
eyes shut; blinds him.
There's a numbing blow on
his wrist, a crash of glasses
and the clicking-home of hand-
cuffs.
Jean lowers the dripping
beer-gun dazedly; looks at it
as if she’d never seen it before.


Flat-negative Furniture
of the Jwentieth Century
By RONALD McCUAIG
Studying an American book on the
world’s furniture-styles, 1 looked up
from the cedar bed, where I study,
to my cedar wardrobe and wondered
how it should be classed.
The design is developed from tfiat of
a “Continental” wardrobe ; a demount-
able job in which bolts let into the ends
of the sides are screwed from inside into
nuts let into the ends of the top and
bottom. I have varied this by letting
nuts into the sides and screwing bolts
through top and bottom to engage the
nuts: doing it this way you have to
begin with the wardrobe flat on its front
on the floor, but the result is the same ;
you can’t see the bolt-heads in an Bft.
wardrobe ; and the job is as rigid as
a dovetailed job would be at that stage.
With a back of cedar-faced three-ply
let into grooves and bolted to cedar lugs
screwed and glued around the back
edges, the whole thing stands up as stiff
as cast-iron. Yet I can take it down to
separate planks in 15 minutes.
As I was making the sides of lin.
cedar planks 2ft. wide and Bft. long
(dressed —which means whatever is left
over after they have planed smooth the
planks you bought that size), and as the
cedar had been a tree only a month or so
before, I faced the front, sides and top
with 3in. battens, like angle-girders, to
ensure rigidity ; and I had to make sure
the grain all went the same way, so that
the wood, still wet to the chisel, and
cutting like cheese, would shrink evenly.
So it was necessary to let the two shelves
above the hanging-space into slots in the
sides, and keep them tightly there with
screw-bolts, let into lugs under the shelves,
engaging nuts let into lugs in the sides —
X couldn’t, you see, run straight strips
across the grain for the shelves to rest on.
So the only ornament on the carcass
was the holes in the battens around the
sides and top where the brass screws went
in every 7in.; these I squared and covered
with inlay of lightish cedar. The two
sliding-doors, the full Bft. high, have no
decoration, either; just the two fin.
matched solid-cedar panelsHn each door ;
the doors hang from ball-bearing runners
on the top, so that their thin frames
carry no weight that could buckle them.
TThe total effect, then, though liberally
french-polished, and with almost
French-ballet choreography, since the Bft.
planks demand light, tripping footwork
along their length to ensure that the polish-
ing-pad never pauses in its stroke, was not
suggestive of the French of Louis XV
or the English of Adam ; it had little
affinity with English oak, which, though
simple, was most often carved ; and as
to Provincial well, French Provincial
was merely a slightly-coarsened imita-
tion of ornate Paris style, as English
Colonial was of London style ... I
stopped, modestly, at Peasant Furniture
—but the European peasant, no matter
how much he resembled me in some ways,
was not a disciple of bare line: a bare
line, to him, was something to advance
upon with a carving-knife and a paint-
brush . . . Then I came to Shaker Furni-
ture ; that really is bare. There is a
sewing-bench without even a base —not
an unnecessary cut or piece of wood—
and although the long Shaker table has
turned legs, it has an effect of cold per-
manence, as though designed for the
poor who are always with us.
I began to think of myself as a Shaker,
and turned to the letterpress: the Shakers
were an American sect who did not be-
lieve- in personal reproduction and shook
in church . . .
The analogy, I think, is more comic
than real; it is much more likely that
I am part of a new development Which
I should call Neo-Primitive, except that
there is nothing really simple or primitive
about me or other cabinetmakers of my
kind. The best name for our style would
be Flat-Negative.
To begin with, we all live in flats. We
do not build fixtures into walls; our
pieces are all removable, against that day
when we shall be enlarged into the
spacious dwelling we never cease from
discussing ; and we do not build furni-
ture for one purpose; if possible every
piece must do several things, or must
be built to the ceiling, ta get as much out
of floor-space as the space will allow.
As designers, we are not the kind of
people who know nothing about art but
know what we like ; we know nothing
about art but we know what w Q'dorit
like. The Flat-Negationist has read all
the books on art and design, on significant
form, functionalism, the dictation by
materials of design, and the superiority
of line to ornament; and, if he has not
already got rid of it because of its
childhood-associations, he has for reasons
of taste thrown-out all his father’s
furniture —the huge oak sideboards with
their tall, mantel-framed mirrors, the
heavy-legged dining - tables with their
three or four extra leaves in case some-
one called ; and as flat after flat has
restricted his space he has got rid of his
long, heavy settees, his cumbersome
desks.
When furniture has had to be bought
or replaced he has shuddered in shops
at the flimsy plywood pieces that insult
his poverty ; and crying “No! No! No!”
—the Flat-Negationist’s anthem has
gone to work on the old cedar-fronted
chiffonier they had bought years before
for 12s. 6d. for cupboard-space. Cutting
away the rats’ nibblings, he has restored
with glue and little bits of cedar the
line of the doors and shelves, replaced
the nailed pedestal-base with rounded
legs, recut the panels, glued back the
solid veneer on the edges of the top,
filled its cracks with innumerable cedar
wedges and sanded them level, and,
having taken lessons from his schoolboy
son, he has worked at his first french-
polishing job until, by the magic of many
failures and endless labor, it has come
good.
'T'his first casual effort —slowly growing
into pride in second-rate craftsman-
ship, which makes to the untutored eye
a period - piece from junk —is the
Husband’s Mistake. Thereafter his wife
has him taped ; she leads him by the
carrot of his cabinet-making vanity from
the ancient cedar-fronted chest-of-
drawers —which only needs patching, new
runners on the drawers, new supports
for the rutted slides, complete stripping,
and re-polishing—to the huge, imposing
cedar-fronted chest-of-drawers, of which
the three top drawers are hauled out and
their space filled with a radio-
gramophone, while the three long drawers
become repositories for gramophone-
records, writing-paper, children’s games
and living-room bric-a-brac. He then
feels experienced enough to attack the

A HYMN FOR HANDYMEN
There is a tree that never grows
Until its gum no longer flows,
But then it grows both full and hard'
In joints the amateur has marred;
So let us praise, as praise we should,
The precious gift of Plastic Wood.
By tender application, it
Makes mortices and tenons fit;
It fills the cracks and gaps in shelves
Of men who do things for themselves:
When cabinets and stands have stood
It was to honor Plastic Wood.
Restoring age-worn chests to health
It loves to do its good by stealth,
Not only mending broken parts
But also broken human hearts v
So firm, so modest and so good —•
No wife is wooed like Plastic Wood.

From One Victorious Leader to Another
“Yours Gratefully..."
Dear Bob,
Well, here I am, back
again, and with my majority
more or less intact. You’ve
probably noticed, even in Can-
berra, what the Sydney press
has had to say about my win,
but in case you haven’t I’m
enclosing a few clippings. Pass
them on to Bert when you’ve
finished with them ; he’ll have
plenty of space to spare in the
section of his press-cuttings
book reserved for election-
wins.
I like the bit from the
“Herald”:
If the result is, as appears pos-
sible, an outright Labor victory,
Mr. Cahill is very largely respon-
sible. He will be entitled to claim
it as a personal triumph, for it often
seemed that he was conducting his
party’s campaign single-handed.
Only one or two of his Ministers
gave him any help.
Coming from “Granny,” I
call that real handsome. Mind
you, Bob, 1 don’t think it quite
a fair comment on my
Ministers. Of course, some of
them dragged the chain a bit,
but after all, what can you
expect? We’re not so young
as we used to be and some of
us (not me) are carrying a bit
of extra weight round the
waistline. No offence meant,
Bob, but have you ever
thought of trying this early-
morning swimming? Nothing
like it to keep you fit.
Anyway, back to what
“Granny” said about my
Ministers. Now, take Bob
Heffron. He did what you’d
call a magnificent job during
the election campaign. Rushed
round officially opening schools
that had already been operat-
ing for 18 months or two
years and explaining—as we
all did —that he’d open a lot
more if only you’d come across
with some more dough.
Then there was Billy
stout effort in chal-
lenging the academic qualifica-
tions of Country-party leader
Davis Hughes. Some people
seem to think this was a punch
below the belt because Hughes,
was in hospitaj at the time.
But, after all, Billy is Minister
for Health, so the job was right
in his department. Naturally,
as his leader, I backed him up
by pointing out that I had
never made use of the letters
I’m entitled to through my
honorary doctorates.
Jack Renshaw, too, rallied
round with a promise to release
some green-belt land,' though,
to be perfectly frank, I’m not
sure whether that would count
for us or against us. And I
mustn’t forget the assistance I
got from Bill Gollan and Abe
Landa. There seems to be a
suggestion that because these
two old friends of mine took
opposing views on a matter of
great national interest and
stated them forcibly in public,
the party might lose some votes
or appear divided. That, as
you know very well, Bob, is
sheer nonsense. Never has
Labor been so united. Well,
hardly ever.
At the same time, it’s no
good being excessively modest,
as I think you’ll agree. What
I mean to say is that fellows
“Pat Morion's face grinning at me..."
who go on winning election
after election like you and me
must have something. Mind
you, I’ll admit I had some
anxious moments.
F’rinstance, having Bert on
my platform wasn’t exactly a
good-luck omen, especially
with young Clive only a couple
of suburbs away running me
down like nobody’s business,
with the backing of people
who usually back Bert. Still,
perhaps it was even more
embarrassing for the Doc.
than for me.
Then there was Pat Morton’s
bargain-sale offer of free travel
for schoolkids. I’ll admit that
rocked me. Bob. Didn’t thirtk
he had it in him. Of" course, I
hit back by calling him
Promising Pat and saying it
couldn’t be done without
wrecking the economy. That’s
a bit I got from you, Bob,
and I’ll admit it.
Was I as confident as I told
the papers? Well, there’s no
harm now in saying that I had
my moments of doubt. A
couple of nights before the poll
I had an awful nightmare.
Chasing buses all night. And
every time I got close to one,
it’d pull away and a conductor
with Pat Morton’s face grin-
ning at me would say, '“You’ve
missed the bus, Joe.” I woke
up in a sweat.
Still, even that wasn’t quite
as bad as another dream I had.
Dreamed the election resulted
in a deadlock and Clive came
to me and said he’d be willing
to serve under me provided
I made liim Premier. Can’t
make out what Clive’s got
against me. Jack Lang, too.
Did you hear whqt Jack said
about my Goverment? “Let’s
get rid of the rascals,” he said.
Rascals, mind you Fancy him
saying that sort of thing about
me. After all, he knows me
well enough. I learnt most of
my politics under his leader-
ship.
Fact is, Bob, my real pur-
pose in writing is to thank you
for all you’ve done for me.
J don’t mean by saying you
wouldn’t underwrite Pat’s
promises, and I’m not referring
to your visit to North Sydney.
What I mean is you’ve set me
a pattern and at the same time
provided me with material for
winning elections. Whenever
things have started to get a
trifle warm down here —you
know, people bellyaching about
housing or difficulty in getting
hospital accommodation or
shortage of schools or anything
like that, I've always been able
to pass the buck to you. And
what’s more, Bob, they seem
to swallow it. And at Premiers’
Conferences when I say my
piece about rights and
Commonwealth dictation and
so on, you always seem to take
it in good part and realise
that it’s just good clean fun
and that I don’t want our
taxing-rights back at all. I
know as well as you do that
if it wasn’t for the general
prosperity of the rest of Aus-
tralia I wouldn’t be able to
make such gestures as three-
weeks’ leave and equal—well,
sort of equal—pay.
I’ll tell you something in con-
fidence, Bob. I was nearly
stumped for an election gim-
mick this time. I felt that the
good old Blame Menzies tech-
nique that landed me the bacon
in 1953 and 1956 might be
wearing a bit thin. So I
decided to pinch your Stay-put
Policy—judge-us-on-our-record
and all that. Some of the boys
thought I was mad. “It worked
ail right for Bob,” they said,
“because he delivered the
goods. But it won’t work
for you, Joe. You haven’t
delivered the goods.”
But my argument is this,
Bob. As long as the electors
get the goods they don’t
trouble to ask who delivered
them. You and I both know
that, no matter what the Doc.
says, the people- of Australia
(and New South Wales) aren’t
unemployed, aren’t starving
and aren’t desperate. In fact,
they know when they’re well-
off. And what happens? They
put you back and they put me
back!
So carry on as you’re going,
Bob. You deliver the goods
and I’ll take my share of the
credit. As long as you’re safe,
I’m set.
See you at the Loan Council,
Yours gratefully,
Joe.

SPORTING NOTIONS
YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
The Doncaster
The Bulletin’s Melbourne
sporting scribe did a brilliant
bit of long-range Doncaster
tipping. After the Newmarket,
he wrote here (B. 11/3/’59):
Tudor Hill's third again indi-
cated that tlie five-year-old Otto-
man horse improves a stone in
heavy going. If he strikes similar
conditions in Sydney he will be a
real Doncaster chance.
That bit of long-range good-
oil the Melbourne chap
improved on in the following
issue (B. 18/3/’59) with this
further comment:
It was mentioned here last week
that Tudor Hill’s minor placing in
the Newmarket was a good Don-
caster pointer. An even better one
was his victory in the mile Fare-
well Handicap at Flemington. The
Ottoman horse carried 9.2, and
drops to 8.1 i for the Sydney mile.
It may be worth remembering that
lie won the Toorak Handicap in the
spring. If it happens to be wet
in Sydney on Easter Saturday,
Tudor Hill will be worth a piece of
anybody’s money. (iood in any
going, he revels in the mud.
And, of course, Tudor Hill
duly won in a walk —at 25
to 1! !
So in his batch for last week-
end The Bulletin’s Mel-
bourne scribe could report:
It is not often that rank-and-file
racegoers look cheerful at the
success of a 25-to-l shot, but there
were smiles aplenty at Flemington
over Tudor Hill’s Doncaster win.
The deep-rooted Sydney-Melbourne
rivalry dies hard on the racecourse,
and Melbourne punters have not
taken kindly to the all-round
superiority of Sydney gallopers
over the last decade.
One Melbourne man who did not
share in the general satisfaction
at Tudor Hill's success was Ron
Hutchinson, who turned-down the
offer of the Doncaster mount.
There was a lot of consolation for
Hutchy, however, in Count Tassia’s
win in the Victoria Handicap, first
leg of the M.R.C.’s Easter double.
In. the Sydney mile visitors
scooped the pool. There was
£5360 in it for English owner
S. G. Morgan, who has never
seen his Melbourne-trained
Tudor Hill win a race, though
he has made a number of visits
to Victoria when the five-year-
old gelding has been racing. On
Guard, from Perth, was second,
and Brisbane’s Book Link
third.
Backers of the first three
horses in the Doncaster betting
—Skyline, Fuss and Bold Pilot
—had a good view of them
near the tail of the field when
Tudor Hill was winning in
easy fashion. He ran the mile
in 1.36.3, which is average for
the race. He was the first
Melbourne-trained Doncaster
winner in more than 20 years.
On Guard —like Tudor Hill,
an outsider —had won several
races in Perth and also been
successful in Adelaide. Second-
money in the Doncaster was
£l2OO and third £6OO.
Tudor Hill, trained by
N. H. Francis, gave Sydney
apprentice G. Howard his
most important success. He
handled the visitor with skill.
Howard is apprenticed to
Randwick trainer Harry Plant,
who earlier in the day won the
Sires’ Produce Stakes with
Fine And Dandy.
No excuses were, or could
have been, offered for the
beaten horses. Tudor Hill had
only two of the other 17
runners behind him on the
home-turn, went through on
the inside, and had three
lengths to spare at the finish!
He is by Ottoman (imp.) from
Charmeuse by Enfield (imp.)
from Fine Mouche (imp.) by
Singapore, and cost his owner
lOOOgns. as a yearling.
In winning the St. Leger on
Bardshah, R. Selkrig rode a
near-perfect race in front,
making his own, and most of
the time slow, pace. Though
the winner was the outsider
of the only three starters,
owner-breeder M. V. Point and
trainer Bob Stuart regarded
his stout staying-blood and
recent form as sound pointers
to success, no matter how the
race was run. His three wins
from four starts and a close
fourth at the other outing
represented solid form, and in
a Graduation event at Rosehill
he had carried 9st. and beaten
Valerius (8.8).
Australia’s best two-year-
old, Fine And Dandy, won his
sixth race on end—two of
them against all-ages—when he
narrowly defeated Travel Boy
and Ramazan in the A.J.C.
Sires’ Produce Stakes. Travel
Boy had won the V.R.C. Sires’
Produce, and was expected by
his trainer, T. J. Smith, to go
close to downing the odds-on.
favorite. He did go close,
too, as Fine And Dandy’s win-
ning margin was only half-a-
head. Run in 1.24.3, the race
was a true test for the seven-
furlongs course.
• • • •
Fine And Dandy brought
his stake-earnings to £16,384:
Tulloch’s £18,478 tops the list
for a two-year-old season, fol-
lowed by Mollison, £17,343.
M. V. Point offered several
Royal Empire yearlings at the
Randwick auction two years
ago, but he was disappointed
with the light bidding and
passed a number in. Bargains
were missed. Point retained
three of the yearlings, all sub-
sequent winners, with Bard-
shah top performer. An offer
of 250gns. for Bardshah at the
sales was declined, as was
HOgns. for Royal Perception
and 120gns. for Morning
Gleam. Point still owns the
last-named pair, and they have
won several good races.
Bardshah’s yearling brother —
a brown colt by Royal Empire
(imp.) from Camshah (imp.)
by Shahpoor from Camerette
by Cameronian/ — will be
put on offer at the Rand-
wick auction on Monday next
by studmaster Alec Higgins,
of Muswellbrook. Royal
Empire won at 13 furlongs in
England and was placed at two
miles. He also finished second
in the Grand Prix de Paris
(one mile, seven furlongs ; 26
starters). The A.J.C. St. Leger
was worth £2223.
Star Boy won his first race
in seven months when he
secured a lucky rails-run in the
First Vaucluse Handicap on
St. Leger day. The four-year-
old gelding, who had had four
previous wins, was having only
his second run after a spell of
several months. Eastern Song
came home strongly for second
money.
New Zealand trainer T. W.
Green had a winning double
on the A.J.C.’s opening day
at Randwick. My Melodee
repeated her win of the previ-
ous week by clearing out with
the Keith Mackay Handicap
for two-year-old fillies,, while
Royal Jester won the Tocal
Handicap in fine style. Both
winners were ridden by Les
Coles, who is finding his
Sydney visit profitable. En-
dure ran a game race with
9.5 in the Mackay Handicap.
Had the track been fast she
may have lasted the trip out.
In finishing second, Luna Park
also raced up to form.
Withdrawal of Wiggle from
the Autumn Stakes reduced
interest in the mile-and-a-half
w.-f.-a. contest. There was a
plunge on New Zealand stayer
Ark Royal, but he missed a
place in four starters. The
favorite, Cassar, was well
ridden by N. Sellwood to beat
Baystone and Prince Darius.
• • • •
A.J.C. handicapper Ken
Goodwin should have been
well satisfied by the finish of
the Second Vaucluse Handi-
cap, in which Merry Amber
beat the hot favorite Win-
chester by a nose, with Grecian
Vale, in the centre, a further
nose away third.
. Features of Ladies’ Day at
Randwick today (Wednesday)
will be the w.-f.-a. All Aged
Stakes (one mile), the Cham-
pagne Stakes (for top two-
year-olds ; six furlongs), and
the Randwick Council Cen-
tenary Plate, a nine-furlongs
handicap in honor of the racing
suburb’s centenary.
Tn recent years N. Sellwood
has won the All Aged Stakes on
King’s Fair, Prince Morvi and
Cortauld (later Prince Cor-
tauld). Jim Pike won the
race seven times, his winners
including Peter Pan, Chatham
and Amounis. Other notable
gallopers to win it have
included Bernborough, Yaralla
(twice), Ajax (three times),
Mollison, Limerick, Valicare,
Beauford and Desert Gold.
Wiggle won the Champagne
Stakes last year at 7 to 1 on.
Ridden by Bill Carner, she
did it in 1.11, which is faster
than most Champagnes ; but
Todman's 1.10 two years ago
is the race-record. That time
he beat Tulloch.
Tomorrow (Thursday) and
Friday the annual yearling-
sales will be continued by
William Inglis and Son at their
Newmarket stables at Rand-
wick. The sales will be con-
cluded next Monday. The 176

M.R.C. Meeting
As mentioned here last week,
Count Tassia, the big chestnut
coll by Neapolitan from Joy-
stream, has not been over-
raced, and he showed the
benefit of trainer Theo Lewis’s
shrewd handling when he
bolted in with the £2500 seven-
furlongs Victoria Handicap at
Flemington last Saturday. On
a track that was certainly not
lightning-fast, Count Tassia
ran the seven in 1.24 J, which
equalled Savoy’s race-record,
set in 1951.
Lewis has the rich Brisbane
winter racing in mind for
Count Tassia, and the big colt
may go on improving enough
to take out the Doomben or
Stradbroke.
The Victoria Handicap has
been a great race for three-
year-olds—Count Tassia was
the fourth in a row to win
the event. Lord won it in ’5B.
In most years two-year-old
favorites are as safe a betting-
medium as a punter can hope
for, but this season in Mel-
bourne the youngsters have not
been running as consistently as
usual. In the seven-furlongs
Acorn Stakes Royal Crown
was, on form, rightly an even-
money chance. At his previous
start he had trounced a good-
class field down the straight-
six. 1 o the turn on Saturday
he looked like winning just as
easily, but he made the bend
very erratically, and gave Ron
Hutchinson a torrid time down
the straight before he finished-
up under the roses on the
grandstand side. Meanwhile,
Deep Tan had come home
truly down the flat side, to
win easily. The winner, who is
by Wiggle’s sire, Rego, from
Deep Freeze, should win at
least a middle-distance as he
matures.
High Peal opened first choice
in the nine-furlongs Easter
Handicap for three-year-olds,
but his stablemate, the maiden
performer Smo k e y Jane,
attracted a little money, and
the Bob Major colt “blew” to
fives. It didn’t stop him
winning easily. It was a con-
solation-win for trainer Joe
Mucahy, who had wanted to
take the colt across for the
A.J.C. St. Leger. Mulcahy
still thinks the colt would have
won the classic.
Like a schoolboy picturing
himself making a century
against England, an apprentice
might dream about riding a
treble at Flemington. Fancy
became fact for young R.
Mallyon when he won the last
three races at headquarters on
Saturday. He rode a double at
the corresponding meeting last
year, and this page then com-
mented that “good judges in
Melbourne believe that the
apprentice-lad R. Mallyon will
turn-out a top-ranking jockey.”
Unfortunately, the lad was
seriously injured in a fall last
year. Saturday’s triple success
was his first slice of luck on
a city course since he resumed
riding. His winners were Trad-
field (Hampton Handicap),
King of Trumps (second divi-
sion of the Westall Trial) and
Foxley (Kingswood Handicap).
There was a Nat Gould
touch to Foxley’s win. On
Friday night trainer R. G.
Gray disturbed an intruder at
Foxley’s stall. A black gelding,
Foxley’s by star miler Attley
from Ingoda Fox. Five fur-
longs is as far as he cares to
go, but he’s very smart over
that short journey.
It was good to see Jack
Purtell ride a double on Satur-
day—on Correaless and High
Peal. He got Correaless home
by sheer strength in the first
heat of the Westall Trial. A
furlong out, the four-year-old
Ruthless gelding seemed to
“Bran new, too! Ain't even been 'it properly!"
have had enough, but Purtell
kept him going to hold off the
fast-finishing Idle Mac, who
had been running well around
the Riverina.
“P.0.M.C.,” on being “paid
to think"’:
In warning a visiting jockey
against causing interference at
Warwick Farm recently, chief
steward Burke said: “You are not
paid to think; you should make
sure. If the luck of the race is
against you, that’s your bad luck.”
I wonder how the old-time Wood-
Toohey-Johnstone-Bartle school of
hoops would have regarded the
literal interpretation of that dictum?
In their day—the heyday of racing
in N.S.W. —too-timid waiting for
saloon-passages in races would have
raised the ire of punters, and even
occasioned the risk of official
rebuke for not trying.
Deliberate rough-riding, of course,
is, and should be, punished, but the
luck of the race never favors the
rider who first makes sure of a clear
run before he makes it. In fact,
clear runs are rare in race-riding—
theoretically, every jockey in the field
is paid to take the shortest way
round and get home first if he can.
Consequently, no race is run
safely in the strict sense of the
word. Normal risks must be, and
are, regularly taken, and accidents
sometimes happen. In principle,
only jockeys who mix skill with
courage and enterprise reach the
top—-and there’s a happy medium
between the rough and the ready
in jockeying.
But hasn’t the “riding-master”
attitude of Sydney stewards in recent
years had the effect of driving
jockeys too far in the direction of
caution?
“Postscript”: In no game
like racing is one’s luck either
well in or well out almost
never does it cut even. After
a long spell of “outs,” then
alter a good trot lasting several
weeks, jockey Jack Thompson
collected a “holiday” which
excluded him from the main
days of the Easter carnival at
Randwick. We punters suffer
these extremes of fortune, too.
What a pity the stewards don't
suspend us during our unblest
spells!

The 30-man British Isles
Rugby Union team to tour
N.Z. and Australia has been
described as one of the greatest
of all British touring teams.
That cannot be decided before
it is seen in action —if it can
really be decided even then.
Still, it does include many
famous Rugby personalities of
recent years.

Included among them are the
skipper, Ireland’s hooker, Ron
Dawson; red-headed Irish
winger Tony O’Reilly; two
other very speedy wingers,
Young (England) and Brophy

“Old Pivot’': With the

for one season. Hoped that the
move will lessen congestion on

produce more attractive foot-
ball. The two wingers are to be
dispensed with.

the “Geelong Flyer,” Davis,
fast and powerful, had been
a member of the 1951 and 1952
premiership teams and had led
Geelong for the last three

year, and was also picked to
lead the Australian team
chosen at the end of the

was switched repeatedly from
attack to defence and back
to attack —wherever, in fact,
a weak Geelong was weakest;
and almost always he domi-

Sydney Rugby League’s
1959 competition got away
over the Easter weekend with
a complete round on both
Saturday and Monday. Match
of the day on Saturday was
between the two clubs which
contested last year’s grand-
final, St. George and West;
the Saints won a gruelling
“grand” 20-9 for its third suc-
cessive premiership. On Satur-
day in an exciting seesawing
game, St. George, which scored
four tries to one, just got there
by one point, 18-17. Fullback
Russell’s boot kept West in it.
West, in fact, would have won

Federation game on Saturday,
Hakoah, playing the better
football all through, beat
Auburn 2-1. Another interest-

“Kanimbla”: Members of
Brazil’s national Soccer-team,
which won the World Cup last
year, had to ask that no more
gifts be sent to them because
it had become plainly embar-
rassing. Also embarrassing
were the proposals of marriage.
The team’s skipper, for in-
stance, received from Brazilian
admirers five houses (complete
with swimming-pools), three
farms, one motor-car, four
horses, 12 fishing-outfits, 10
refrigerators and 180 phono-
graph-records, three of them
gold-plated. “I have also
received over five-hundred
offers of marriage,” said the
captain, “from ladies I have
never even met, and it is not
gallant for a man to say ‘No.’
It is embarrassing.”

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
IRAQI REVOLT
"Dress comment on the un-
successful revolt against
General Kassem’s Government
in Iraq:
“New York Times”: “The
Government of General
Kassem has been struggling
against a twofold opposition,
both groups of which are non-
Communist. One seeks an
independent Iraq free of Com-
munist and Nasserite influence.
The other is working with, and
probably under the direction
of, President Nasser of the
United Arab Republic and is
imbued with the emotions of
Arab nationalism. Colonel
Shawaf was tied-up with the
latter group. Since the suc-
cessful revolt of last July 14
Premier Kassem has accepted
support from the Communists
against his opponents.
“This state of affairs cannot
have changed fundamentally.
A battle has been won by the
Kassem Government, but it
must be expected that the
elements impelled by Arab
nationalism and backed by
President Nasser will keep on
trying. So will those Iraqis
who are dismayed by General
Kassem’s growing dependence
on the Communists. The pic-
ture today is therefore not a
happy one, and the end is not
in sight.”
The same : “Both these men
[Kassem and Nasser] follow
curiously parallel policies in
their own countries. They
accept Communist support and
try to get the most out of the
Soviet Union on one side and
the Western Powers on the
other. It is a policy of inde-
pendence, or ‘positive neutral-
ity’ so far as the cold war is
concerned, but there is no
neutrality toward each other.
This is power-politics of the
most obvious sort, and it is
disturbing to think that it is
most likely going to continue
for some time.”
* * *
London “Financial Times” :
“The revolt is a further symp-
tom of the development toward
anarchy in Iraq. There are now
a number of different forces
fighting to control the country,
including the Communists and
the pro-Egyptian group, but
also including the Kurds—
some of whom have Commu-
nist and some anti-Communist
sympathies—the forces of the
older social order, and the
modern Iraqi soldiers who still
seem to look to General
Kassem for leadership. At
present the most likely course
of events seems to be a recur-
rent series of attempted revolts,
of which any one may be suc-

cessful, only to be followed by
further attempts to overthrow
any new revolutionary
authority that is established.”
* * *
“Yorkshire Post”: “It is
really very little use wondering
whether Colonel Shawaf, alive
or dead, was or is pro-Nasser
or anti-Nasser. The important
fact about Colonel Shawaf is
that he is a Kurd ; and Briga-
dier Tabakchali, who has been
named as another leader of the
rebellion, is also a Kurd. Not
only were both these officers
old friends of the Hashemite
Royal family and of Nun; the
Brigadier was the owner of the
Baghdad racecourse, and
General Kassem, in a mood of
puritanical, anti-Western zeal,
suppressed horse-racing a few
months ago.
“It may be difficult to think
of members of the Jockey Club,
however exasperated by any
Governmental action, rising in
revolt and marching on White-
hall : but temperaments and
ideologies are different north
and east of Suez. It was one
of Nuri’s major achievements
that over many years he
managed to hold Iraq together
as a viable State by preserving
the peace between the Kurds
and the Arabs of the riverine
plain. With his death, that
perilous equilibrium has been
shattered.
“In essence this has been
a Kurdi rebellion; in victory
or in defeat it serves to empha-
sise the fearful instability of
the Middle East at present and,
as a by-product, the pitiful
failure of every effort on the
part of the Western Powers to
co-ordinate and put into prac-
tice a strong and agreed policy
throughout the whole region.”
* * *
London “Daily Telegraph” :
“What needs to be emphasised
is Nasser’s share of responsi-
bility for this danger to the
Arab world. He has put Egyp-
tian Communists behind bars,
but his interference in Iraq has
done more than anything else
to magnify the influence of the
Communists there.
“Kassem’s tenderness to-
wards them is only half the
story. If he allowed them free-
dom to organise artd make
propaganda, that was a natural
consequence of the revolution
—a liberation of whatever Nuri
had suppressed. It was the
domestic counterpart of the
welcoming of Iron Curtain
missions, as a balance to
former Western monopoly.
“Kassem may not have
realised the risks he was taking.
But it is Nasser who has forced
him to go on taking them, rely-
ing more and more on Com-
munist support to combat those
who want to bring Iraq under
Egyptian hegemony. Nasser
now comes out as the cham-
pion of Arab nationalism
against Communism. Between
these millstones is being ground
the independence of Iraq.”
* * *
London “Daily Mail’’: “If
Kassem survives in Iraq he
may become the complete
Soviet puppet —the Grotewohl
of the Middle East. In that
event Nasser’s United Arab
Republic could easily fall
apart, for half of it —Syria—
is already riddled with Com-
munism. The pieces are falling
into place in a manner long
foretold here [in Britain],
Nasser, in trying to play-off
East against West, seems to
have overplayed his hand.
“He is no friend of Britain’s,
but we cannot rejoice at his
setback, for a Red Iraq is as
dangerous to us as it is to him.
“It would have been bad for
us if Nasserism had prevailed
in Iraq. But, grasping and pre-
datory though it is, we believe
it would have been a lesser evil
than Russian Communism.
“Nasser has missed a great
chance. When he came to
power he enjoyed British good-
will. As one token of it, we
withdrew from Egypt. The
new leader could then have
rebuilt his country. He could
have been to Egypt what
Kemal was to Turkey. He
could have established a solid

After Moscow
/'Aeneral opinion among
U.K. papers to hand is
that Prime Minister Mac-
millan’s visit to Moscow—
whatever its final effect on
London “Daily Mail.”
LESSONS FROM THE OLD MASTER.
attitudes in Paris, Bonn and
. Washington—was a sincere
and valuable contribution to
the struggle for world peace
through negotiation. Opinion
is summarised by London
“Sunday Times”:
“When Mr. Macmillan went
to Moscow he took a big risk.
A negative result could have
weakened him politically at
home and abroad ; too positive
a result could have excited the
suspicion of our Allies. Heie
he was undoubtedly helped by
Mr. Khrushchev’s provocative
and erratic tactics, which
enabled the Prime Minister to
be stiff and strong in present-
ing the West’s case, yet with-
out seeming to answer con-
cession with rebuff, or hospi-
tality with ill-will. Conspicuous
success was impossible: con-
spicuous failure might have
made the international tension
far worse. The risk was
courageously taken, and the
result justified it completely.
“The purpose was that of a
‘voyage ' of discovery.’ Mr.
Macmillan, it appears, dis-
covered certain cardinal truths
about Mr. Khrushchev’s atti-
tude. First, that he is determ-
ined to carry through his
Berlin policy and tc link it to
a peace-treaty with East
Germany which, he claimed at
Leipzig, would release him
from the obligations of Pots-
dam.
“Secondly, that he shrinks
from world war as the cost
of conflict: Soviet orthodoxy
has been forced by the geno-
cidal power of the nuclear
bomb to recast Marxist theory
on the inevitability of eventual
war between capitalism and the
revolution.
“Thirdly, Mr. Macmillan
learnt that, no doubt for this
reason Mr. Khrushchev is
prepared not only to negotiate
about Berlin but actually to
consider important conces-
sions to the West, provided he
gets his way over recognition
of East Germany.
“The first substantial gain,
therefore, from Mr. Mac-
millan’s visit, apart from pro-
gress in purely Anglo-Soviet
relations in trade and cultural
interchange, is agreement that
-Berlin and other outstanding
East-West problems are sub-
ject to negotiation —as distinct
from submission to an ulti-
matum or a fait accompli.
“Indeed, even the optimists
were surprised at Mr. Khrush-
chev’s agreement, after all his
sarcastic refusals, to a Foreign
Minister’s conference which
might be allowed as much as
two months to prepare for a
‘summit.’ True, the Foreign
Ministers’ role is to be only
procedural; but procedure
includes agenda, and the
broadening of the summit
agenda is a vital point.
“The second substantial
gain, in fact, is to have got
Russian assent to putting the
Berlin issue in the setting of
Germany’s whole future, and
Germany’s future in the setting
of European security generally.
This gives us room for man-
oeuvre and takes some of the
tension out of that isolated
issue. The passage in the joint
communique about the possi-
bility of partial disarmament in
an agreed area of Europe is no
doubt to be regarded in this
light. It is not a policy: it is
an extension of the terrain on
which policy can be discussed.
“A third substantial gain
was the reanimation of the
Geneva talks on nuclear arma-
ment, which had been at
death’s door. A genuine
system of inspection would be
worth a great deal, above all
as a fracture in the wall of
seclusion that barricades the
Communist countries against
the ideas and facts of the outer
world—a wall from which Mr.
Macmillan himself dislodged a
large brick.
“For the problem of the co-
existence of East and West will
not be finally settled, one way
or the other, by May 27, or
whatever other date Mr.
Khrushchev chooses as a dead-
line. It will continue to vex
us, and our children, until its
causes dwindle. Mr. Mac-
millan’s mission will be truly
judged as a step in the long
march of history, and as such
it may prove to be the turning-
point of our times.”
Khrushchevese
a letter to New York
“Herald Tribune,” signed
“George St. George, Paris”:
“For years now, reading
reporting about Russia, I have
been shocked by constant mis-
interpretations of Khrushchev’s
utterings. This, in my opinion,
is a Very serious stumbling-
block on a way to better under-
standing between the two
worlds.
“The fact is that Khrush-
chev does not speak standard
Russian, but a highly idiomatic
‘narodnyi,’ or folk-language,
full of peasant proverbs and
obscure allusions which
cannot be properly translated
by anyone without a thorough
knowledge of this semantic
medium.
“The latest glaring example
of this is his reported uttering
in Leipzig when, according to
reporters, he said a rather in-
congruous thing: ‘Do not
frighten us —we are already
frightened.’ An admission of
weakness? Not at all.
“This is merely an exact


translation of an untranslatable
Russian folk-saying: ‘Ne
pugaiteh nasmy uzhe pugan-
nye.’ The whole key here lies
in the word ‘pugannye’ a
completely untranslatable
semantic titbit meaning, ‘having
been subjected to the fear
treatment before,’ rather than
‘ispugannye’ which means
‘frightened.’ The whole phrase
should be freely translated as
‘Do not frighten us—it’s been
already unsuccessfully tried,’
and this idiomatic expression is
often used in Russian col-
loquial speech, especially in
rural districts.
“Russian is perhaps the most
incredibly flexible language in
the world, affording a variety
of semantic nuances far in
excess of any other European
language.”
Spreading U.K. Ideas
Tp ditorial comment on the
British Government’s
decision to raise its annual
expenditure on information-
services at home and abroad
from £l5 million to £l6]
million:
London “Daily Express’:
“The hope is that foreigners
will have a deeper respect for
Britain because more British
culture is laid on their door-
steps at the taxpayers' expense.
What a delusion!
“Foreigners, especially in
the Middle East, will be much
more impressed by the fact
that Britain has just signed a
financial agreement with
Nasser, handing-over immense
assets at bargain rates. They
will see that agreement as a
sign of weakness.
“It will take more than the
British Council to offset that
impression.”
* * V
“Manchester Guardian”:
“Most of the increase in
expenditure will go to the
British Council, and much of
this in turn will be spent on
teaching English and helping
foreign students to come to
this country. Work of this
kind does almost unalloyed
good : no one but Lord Beaver-
brook is likely to object. But
here one hopes that help will
not be parcelled out by
preference to those whose
friendship is most useful to us
or to those who we fear may
turn sour if we do not woo
them. Cultural cupboard-love
earns contempt, and rightly so.
“This does not mean that
there are not in particular
countries urgent needs to be
met. Nobody asks for foreign
broadcasts, but plenty of
people in countries like India
and Pakistan want more Eng-
lish books at prices they can
afford. The Government is to
do something through the
British Council to meet this
need. Books will be presented
to university libraries and lent
to students. This should be
of some help. But the main
job of sending out British
books should be left to British
publishers: that is economic-
ally and morally the healthier
way.
“The trouble is that pub-
lishers face Russian com-
petitors who virtually give
away English books, and
American competitors who
take payment in the buyer’s
own currency. The Govern-
ment has not yet decided
whether and how to help our
publishers. Some kind of
arrangement over currency is
surely feasible. It would
knock a little off the balance
of payments, but the long-term
returns would be worth it.”

London “Daily Telegraph'’ :
“Specially welcome is the new
emphasis on local services in
Africa, where action by the
Colonial Office was five years
overdue. The same is broadly
true of the 8.8. C. and the
Middle East: too little, and
too late. Indeed, Dr. Hill [the
Minister responsible] has had
to make a great effort to catch
up with the failure of Ministers
to take these matters seriously.
“Even now the scope and
vision of the cold-war
operation are inadequate,
as Mr. Antony Head in-
sisted in the Defence debate
last week. We fail to
organise our friends abroad
and fail to inspire them. We
counter fervid subversion with
an objectivity that impresses
only the most sophisticated. We
neglect the press and we do
not secure the very best men
and women to confront dedi-
cated enemies. If more money
were available Dr. Hill could
create a first-class service of
counter-propaganda—which is
what is needed.”

Salvador de Madariaga, in a
letter to the same paper, states
that “some of us have been for
years drawing the attention of
the free world to the fact that
the Spanish dictatorship, in it-

Wooing the
Uncommitted
T ondon “Time and Tide”
comment on Soviet policy
in Latin America and Africa:
“Latin America today is at
a crucial stage of its history.
Many of the countries are
undergoing rapid social and
economic changes. These
changes in turn have brought
into being new population-
groups which challenge the old
order. These groups, impatient
in their demands for political
status and better material
existence, are generally not
only important targets for
Communist propaganda but
susceptible to its appeals,
especially when they are
couched in nationalist terms.
“At the 21st party congress
in Moscow representatives
from every Latin American
country were present in full
strength for the first time.
These delegates were delighted
to learn that Moscow fully
appreciated the strategic im-
portance of Latin America and
was intending to give it top
priority, together with Africa,
in-world strategy. The Com-
munists, who have managed
to gain influence in Latin
America out of all proportion,
to their numbers, are planning
to launch a great organisa-
tional drive that will coincide
with Russia’s economic offen-
sive, which in this part of the
world takes the form of buy-
ing surpluses as well as offering
goods at cut-rate prices.
“The U.S.S.R.’s major ob-
jective is the neutralisation of
Latin America and its ultimate
alienation from the United
States. Soviet planners realise
that this area is both a ‘back-
yard with a back-door’ to
America and a source of raw
materials vital to the West.
In order to win the intellec-
tuals the Communists have
developed a ‘negative nation-
alism’ which extols the ‘pre-
Columbian civilisations’ of
Latin America. The aim
behind this is to destroy all
‘Continental’ feeling engend-
ered by the Spanish and
Portuguese. The same ‘nega-
tive nationalism’ is being
spread in Africa, where ancient
African cultures are being
lauded with the same objective
in mind—that of belittling
everything European.
“Russia now has a special
institute for the study of Africa
and of methods of ‘liberating’
the African continent. One of
the top specialists on Africa in
the U.S.S.R. is Dr. I. I.
Potekhin, who recently spent
three months in Ghana making
an on-the-spot study of that
country. Ghana is to receive
a 75-strong mission ; 40
scholarships have been offered
to Sudanese students to study
behind the Iron Curtain ; East
Germany is to trade with
Guinea ; Poland is negotiating
a shipping arrangement with
Ghana ; and Radio Moscow is
now broadcasting in English,
French and Swahili and is at
the same time distributing
cheap ‘saucepan’ radios in the
villages.
“The disturbances in the
Congo and Nyasaland are not
isolated occurrences. Russia
will capitalise on this ferment
in ‘Nato’s weak southern flank’
just she will in Latin
America. The old order is at
an end in both Africa and
Latin America. The choice
facing the West is between
backing the sound nationalist
leadership in these countries
and lighting a rearguard action
against nationalism which will
serve only to aid the acquisition
of power by the -Communists.”

Sir Anthony Eden: “The
great Powers reached a settle-
ment about Berlin after the
war. That situation can be
changed, but only by agree-
ment. That position must be
upheld, because if it is not all
other agreements will be in
jeopardy, too. There is always
the same warning. Once you
allow international treaties to
be unilaterally abrogated you
are on the slippery slope to
trouble. We have had a few
treaties unilaterally abrogated
in the last few years.”
Mr. R. A. Butler: “The
military threat posed by
Communism is only one
plainly visible part of the ice-
berg appearing above the
surface. The ideological and
economic challenges which lie
beneath must in the long-run
prove the decisive tests.”
Lord Hailsham : “Whatever
else may be true about nation-
alism, the crude kind of
nationalism has had its day.
The nation-State in complete
sovereign isolation and inde-
pendence is no longer a viable
entity. Perhaps the great
giants can get on in a kind of
way. But even the United
States cannot get on without
her allies, and Soviet Russia
demands her satellites. There
is no country from Monaco to
China which can stand alone
on the basis of nationalism.
The future lies with some form
of partnership.”
Mr. Harmar Nicholls, British
Conservative M.P.: “Per head
of population Russia has more
officials, bureaucrats, political
commissars than any other
country. It also has more men
under arms. The result is that
the Russian Budget for this year
totals £64,300 million —more
than 13 times our [Britain’s]
Budget when the population is
only six times as big as ours.
How is it then, you may ask,
that they can envisage ending
income-tax? The answer is:
because income-tax is only a
very small part of their total
tax-collection. Their income-
tax amounts to only 2s. in
the pound. The bulk of their
revenue flows to the Russian
Exchequer from the profits of
the vast State-owned enter-
prises and State shops.”

only thing they can so far call
solid cedar, a little old chest-
of-drawers they got years ago
for £2 10s.; even its back is
|in. cedar . . .
By this time the amateur
craftsman is feeling his oats.
On, on to the complete creation
of a piece of furniture! Fie
has become, in search of bits
of cedar to repair his old
crocks, a talented cedar-getter ;
he is persuaded into thinking
he is persuading his wife that
what is needed is a pair of
solid-cedar beds to replace
their old wire- and plywood-
ended bed, and maybe a solid-
cedar wardrobe. He tots-up
the cedar-footage—two com-
plete cedar beds, with five-ply
platforms, for less than £2O
the two! A cedar wardrobe
for less than £3O!
Lying back on my cedar bed,
I wondered what they really
cost me in the end, taking
into consideration mattresses,
rollers, a rabetting-plane, ply-
wood, brass screws, brass bolts,
an additional solid-cedar base
for the wardrobe, cedar-faced
ply for its back, solid-brass
pulls for the doors, a grooving-
plane, two sets of cramps, 9ft.
hardwood battens to take the
cramps for the bed . . .
I got in the tram at Railway
Square terminus, put my arm
through the window, rested one
end of the 9ft. battens on the
footboard, and held the other
end at “the present,” well up
above the tram-roof, all the
way to Randwick. People
stopped and stared, but fortu-
nately I had an unofficious
tramguard. . .
'T'hus Flat-Negative furniture
is created. It is essentially
a furniture of line, if only be-
cause any attempt at orna-
ment would bring the Flat-
Negationist into competition
with craftsmen ; but I wouldn’t
claim it to be a furniture of
straight line my wardrobe
retains symmetry, for instance,
because I planed both sides to-
gether, and so they dip evenly
about half-an-inch from the
straight. Flat-Negative must
always be inspected from
across the room come too
close to it, and you observe
that the grooving for the
panels is ragged, because the
maker worked without a vice
or bench, using one hand to
hold an Bft. plank on its side
and the other to work the
grooving-plane.
“Pieter WOULD go messing around with helicopter-blades."
For Flat-Negative is not
merely a negation of bad
taste ; it is not the real thing
unless it is a negation of itself:
fine, severe styling and the best
intentions, negatived by the
most appalling craftsmanship.
Its woods are the best obtain-
able, and generally a little
thicker than they need be; its
mortise-and-tenon joints are
conceived in the most laborious
manner and locked by pegs—
sometimes half-inch pegs of
cedar formed by being knocked
through hardwood holes by
the cabinetmaker himself, and
not any of your common bits
of machine-made dowelling;
but if you could see inside
these joints you would find the
mortises and tenons, without
exception, plastered with the
Flat-Negationist’s secret ally,
his secret shame —synthetic*
wood. Without synthetic wood
we couldn’t stand. At any
rate, our works couldn’t.
For this reason it is a pity
that Flat-Negative’s most irti-
portant component will die
with the maker and be lost to
his masterpiece for ever ; that
is, the story of the conditions
under which he made it. That
an Bft. by sft. wardrobe was
made in a living-room 15ft. by
12ft., fully furnished and
occupied, used three times a
day for meals by the family;
the carpet, walls and mould-
ings red with cedar-dust, the
only work-bench the kitchen-
table put alongside the dining-
table and covered with news-
papers to protect their surfaces
. . . that two 3ft. divan-beds
were made in a bedroom with
a chest-of-drawers, a rickety
wardrobe and a double-bed
often occupied by a disgruntled
wife . . . My furniture will
not lack its certificate while I
am alive.
But after that?
Let this valediction to Flat-
Negative be my answer for
my days as a Flat-Negationist
are over. Lately, having re-
bound a few old books, I sug-
gested to my wife a cedar
bookcase, 6ft. tall but only Ift.
wide, that would stand in the
bedroom between the small
chest-of-drawers and the door,
or maybe behind the cedar
armchair on the side of the
living-room door leading to the
hall.
“No more (Flat-Negative)
furniture F* my wife said (her
exact phrase was a little less
printable). “We’ve got too
much (Flat-Negative) furniture
already ; you can hardly move
for it!”
As a woman’s last word, I
thought, it was a Flat-Negative
that was peculiarly worthy of
its object.


which was spotlessly clean
and snug, with quite a few
creature comforts, though I
noticed most of the houses
have outdoor sanitation!
The wind today cut the face.
The country we drove through
was flat, sombre, brooding,
very, very dry with dust on the
edge of the bitumen, the bark
on the birch-trees almost snow-
white. Of course this is the
sapless month. But even now
I feel life everywhere, yes,
even in the frozen fields.
Let me repeat my earlier
idea with a twist: this is the
great moment in the history of
Russia. I believe it began in
the 1860’s, and it may be that
the creative burst is over, that
the Communists are bringing
to everyone the fruits of that
colossal bursting-forth. They
know it is their great moment,
at times tell you of their
achievements in a boasting
way. They are tremendously
alive, bustling, confident.
Their conversations and their
speeches, which they love
making, are packed with lively
images. The intellectual and
cultural life is most impressive.
They believe in knowledge, in
enlightenment and progress.
Their institutes are crowded.
Whenever we lecture we are
questioned by cultivated, well-
read people. I do not know
what would happen to anyone
who did not want to share in
this taste.
Hotel Ukraine,
Moscow,
24th November, 1958.
Aborning at 1 a publishing-
house, where we were
loaded with presents of books.
How can 1 bring it all?
We left at 4.20 p.m. today
for Ilya Ehrenburg’s “dacha,”
drove 60km. in the gathering
dusk through lovely forests
where the Germans and the
Russians fought desperate
battles in the autumn of 1941.
The side of the road was very
muddy after torrential rain—
the main roads here are
wonderful.
We arrived at the dacha at
5.30 p.m. after a brief, peri-
lous trip along a side-road,
with the “Z. 1.5.” slipping
around like a baby in a bath.
Ehrenburg lives with' his
second wife on the slope of
quite a steep hill. He lives with
the creature comforts of a
bachelor don at Oxford. In
appearance he reminded me
of the portraits of Voltaire,
and of course his conversation
is mordant, destructive.
He ridiculed the work of
contemporary Soviet writers,
said it was better for one good
book to be produced than a
thousand mediocre ones. He
was a great contrast to the
enthusiasm and confidence of
Gribachov. I suspect he is a
failure —a man who did not
produce a great work nor lead
a literary movement. Yet in
his isolation and his refusal to
join the enthusiasts in the
Writers’ Union he has retained
a great dignity of bearing and
even a warmth towards the
people he meets.
Night and day have lost
all meaning to us. There is
only inside and outside. Inside
you wear summer clothes ; out-
side you cover everything you
can and hope you get inside
soon. The food here is too
rich, greasy and plentiful for
me. Tomorrow we give
another talk on Moscow Radio,
go to the Chekov Institute,
talk to the Literary Institute,
and see a contemporary Soviet
play.
This is life in the age of the
masses, something from which
by instinct and training I
would have recoiled, but in
real life, seeing it as it is, I
think of it not with unqualified
enthusiasm, but certainly with-
out dismay or revulsion. In
the age of the masses, which
is spreading, and will continue
to spread over the whole world,
we must learn to eat our meals
on a stool at a bar rather than
in lonely splendor; we must
learn, too, to work in a room
crowded with other workers,
to sleep behind curtains in a
room in which there are three
or four other couples behind
curtains . . . These are the only
ways possibly in which we may
all avoid the disasters of war
and poverty. I do not believe
it is necessary to impoverish
the spiritual life as much as
they have done here by break-
ing with religion, by following
in their literature such shallow
ideas as social realism. Still,
the direction'will be towards
a society such as this.
Hotel Ukraine,
Moscow,
26th November, 1958.
morning I went to the
-*• University for a two-
hour talk, which was magni-
ficent. The interpreter, an
Armenian, arrived late. So
we began with Russian and
French. They have read my
works —indeed all the works
are in the Lenin Library and
the University Library.
From 2 to 3 we shopped
madly— at 3 met the Czechs
for visas, etc. —and at 4 the
big event of our trip began.
We dined with Surkov, the
head of the Writers’ Union,
and a member of the Central
Committee of the Communist
Party. I found him a great,
indeed a very great, man. He
is the son of a peasant and
talks, they say, as Tolstoy did,
with earthy images and folk-
wisdom. His Russian, when I
could understand it, was
beautiful. Wait till you hear
me imitate him! There were
speeches . . .
Our plane is due to leave
at 1 p.m. tomorrow if the
weather is good enough. It
has snowed all day, wet snow
which melted on the face.
Now, at 10 p.m., I am told
the temperature has dropped
to minus- 20 degrees.
This has been one of the
great experiences of my life,
and I hope to find the strength
and energy to put it to some
use. Here I am impressed by
the high seriousness, enriched
by gaiety and tenderness. I
am determined that one day
you will come to Moscow.
Before you die, you must hear
the orchestra here play for a
ballet —you must see'a Chekov
play, a Tschaikowsky opera,
you must meet the people.
Forget all about those miser-
ables in the Soviet Embassy
in Canberra. I don't know
where they found them, nor
how they persuaded them to
behave like that. Of course,
one thing is lacking. I told
Surkov today about charity.
It is now 9 a.m. on Thurs-
day. In half an hour I go to
a farewell breakfast, then drive
to the drome, and hope we
can leave. The weather is bad.
Outside I can see the river
frozen over. The glass on my
table-top is cold despite the
heating.
Hotel International,
Prague,
28th November, 1958.
\TTlhen I woke up at 8 a.m.
on Thursday, the Mos-
cow river was frozen. When
we stepped outside the hotel,
we had our first taste of
minus- 20 degrees. It is some-
thing every human - being
should have.
At the aerodrome we heard
that the jet would not leave
for two hours because of bad
weather in Prague, so we
chatted away. We walked out
to the plane at 3 p.m. Moscow
time, kissed Oksana and
Helena farewell at the steps,
and when I came to the top of
the steps I took my hat off to
wave to them. The pain from
the cold made me moan, and
the Russian officials said with
great sympathy: “Please don't
take your hat off in a Russian
winter.” You see, 1 now
realise that when these people
decide to destroy a person,
they do it with great reluctance
—that life, and their feeling
for each other while they are
alive, is what matters
supremely.
The jet was as magnificent
as before —we shot along the
tarmac at a tremendous speed,
shot into the air, and in two
hours ten minutes covered the
1100 miles to Prague. We
landed at Prague at 4.10 Czech
time in the dusk. Here it is
all on a very much smaller
scale than Russia. By the time
we reached the car (a small
Skoda) I was nostalgic for the
tragic grandeur of Russia.
Here I soon realised you meet
the meanness, the lack of
generosity, of a people living
between two great civilisations.
Today we were welcomed by
the Ministry of Culture, took
lunch in old Prague, walked
round the old city, which
reminds me of Edinburgh —-
mists, grimy black walls,
cobblestones on which the
tread of leather sounds like a
hammer on an anvil. In exter-
nals one realises one is back
in the West, amongst the
Italian baroque, the Gothic,
and even some Georgian
influences. But the whole
place seems dead to me, as
though the 17th century had
drained all the life-blood out
of them. Nearly everything
seems derived, even the Com-
munism, whjch has not touched
the life here. In Russia you
meet people who are dedicated
to building a. new society—
here only people who are
keeping the show going, and
not sure why, either, let alone
whether it is worth while.
WISHBONE
Broken wishbone,
fragile thing

my heart to sing

Broken wishbone, -

the 'greater pain

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Wool at the Trade Fair
In describing Melbourne’s
International Trade Fair,
“Collins Street” (B. 11/3/’59)
didn’t comment on the stand
sponsored by the Wool Bureau.
A dreary, outdated, taste-
less affair, complete with arti-
ficial flowers, poor lighting
and sad fabric stands, it was
put to shame by the inspired
stands of other nations offer-
ing a glittering and enormous
variety of quality goods.
Screen-printed wool which
would sell on fashion-value
alone, despite its unreason-
able price, is getting much
more publicity than the manu-
factured articles which use far
greater quantities of wool —
carpets, knitwear and the
like.—lnwyt (Vic.).
Commonwealth Public
Servants
I notice that a committee of
experts (the term is the official
one, not mine), widely inquir-
ing into Commonwealth
Public Service administration,
has advocated a new adminis-
trative division to “attract the
better type of person into the
service and to train selected
personnel for the top executive
positions.” Among other things,
the committee also condemns
the long-standing, if provoca-
tive, seniority-rule in favor of
promotion by ability—what-
ever that precisely means to the
committee.
I’m sure executive and semi-
executive personnel in the
existing third and fourth
divisions of the C.P.S. are not
flattered to learn (after nearly
40 years’ service, some of
them) that in the eyes of the
Government they are not the
better type of person.
(A public servant of 22 years’
standing, I’m a supervisory
officer myself, but don’t mis-
understand me —I’m not grind-
ing my own axe. I’m a public
servant by sheer accident. I
met W. M. Hughes in the
Commonwealth Bank lift one
day in 1937 and desperately
popped it on him for a job,
then and there. Apparently
Billy reckoned me a fit and
proper person. He sent me
with his blessing to a cove who
started me on my public-
service career neatly, gladly
and with dispatch.)
As for the contentious
seniority-rule, I think Sir
Richard Boyer and company
look upon this with eyes both
“Sorry!”
jaundiced and inaccurate. Pro-
bably, by secret ballot at any
rate, public servants as in-
dividuals would wipe this rule
themselves; but not quite for
the same reasons or as immedi-
ately as Sir Richard would.
What’s more, they would re-
place it with something sub-
stantially safer to the individual
than promotion' by mere ability
of selected or favored per-
sons.
Under the present system
it’s human for any public
servant to think he’s as com-
petent as the next man. Con-
sequently, when a less-senior
officer whom he considers less
competent than himself goes
over his head, the officer who
feels injured smartly invokes
the time-honored rule. But if
the junior man proves (by
examination or its equivalent)
his superior competence he
gets the promotion in all cases
except the occasional ones of
“favored nation.”
It is this fact that is so widely
misunderstood outside the
service. An incompetent officer,
senior or otherwise, does not
in general secure promotion
by hard-and-fast application of
the seniority-rule. Much red-
tape has been tied since
seniority counted regardless.
However, promotion to all
positions in all grades should
be automatic —i.e., strictly by
written examination, with
seniority of service the decid-
ing factor only when all other
things are equal.
Finally, if the pattern of the
Commonwealth Public Service
needs changing, its history of
almost exemplary administra-
tion surely suggests 'that the
changes should not be revolu-
tionary. Committees of in-
quiry with motives and inten-
tions of which the present one
is widely suspected do not
make for happiness within the
service. In fact, recommenda-
tions made to date by Sir
Richard’s band of hope
already have further irked the
sensibilities of a body of
responsible people best de-
scribed for some three years
past as frankly restive. —

Test for Listener’s Licence
We have tests for driving-
licences. Why not tests for
listener - licences? For in-
stance, my mother-in-law, who
seems to me to be stone-deaf,
whenever she has the radio on
(approximately 18 hours a day)
can apparently hear it only
when it is going at its loudest
register. My neighbors are
much the same the eternal
serial about the blue lagoon
seems to register with them
only when their radio is emit-
ting sounds like a jet-plane.
Such people, I suggest,
should not have a listener-
licence. If there were a test for
rational listening-ability they
would fail every time.
The toll of the road is almost
equalled by the toll of the ear-
drums which fall as casualties
to this kind of reckless listen-
ing. I am sure also —and this
goes for my mother - in - law,
too—that some of these reck-
less listeners listen while under
the influence and refuse to give
Way to houses on their left, and
right.—Pianissimo (Q.).
Teaching the Rudiments
“Orion” and others (B.
28/1/,’59 to 25/2/’59) are not
alone in their concern about
the poor results of our educa-
tion system. From time to
time teachers and administra-
tors have been similarly
troubled.
In 1946 a conference of
Australian directors of edu-
cation asked the Australian
Council for Educational Re-
search to inquire into English
and Arithmetic courses for
10- to 12-year-olds in all
States.-
As a result an A.C.E.R.
summary entitled “English and
Arithmetic for the Australian
Child” revealed that there
were many differences in the
content of these subjects as
between one State and another.
It indicated wide differences
between comparable children
in comparable grades in
schools within the same State
as well as those in different
States. It showed that much
material was not being learnt
during the year of first intro-
duction ; and it suggested that
a good many topics would be
better deferred until later in
school life. Finally, the report
outlined what was considered
to be a “reasonable” curricu-
lum in each of these subjects.
By 1952 all Australian
Education Departments had
written or were writing new
curricula, most of which
showed the strong influence of
the A.C.E.R. report. An
important feature of most of
these was an attempt to adapt
the course of studies to the
relative maturity of the
students.
One result was that teach-
ing immediately became more

effective; another was that
some topics previously handled
in the primary school were
postponed . to secondary.
Primary-school curricula are
now usually determined by the
Education Departments, while
large parts of secondary
courses are worked out by
Public Examination Boards
deriving from the universities
-—although there are teaching
and departmental representa-
tives as well. There is there-
fore a strong chance of some
disruption of the smooth pro-
gress of a child’s studies
between the primary and
secondary schools.
Most of the criticism in
these columns has been of
secondary education, particu-
larly in English and maths. “I
Teach ’Em” (B. 25/,2/’59)
refers to the unreal demands
of the essay in Queensland’s
Senior examination. By con-
trast, the essay section in
W.A.’s Leaving paper for 1958
gave a choice of such topics
as “Christmas Cards,” “The
Empire Games,” “A Rottnest
Island Fable,” “Prigs,” “School
Broadcasts,” “Famous
Women” and “Wildflowers.”
A time of lhr. 40min. was
allowed in which to write three
pages.
Books set for the Leaving in
W.A., as in Queensland,
included the usual Shakspeare,
Chaucer, Miltoq, Coleridge
and Wordsworth, but as alter-
natives there were also Vance
Palmer’s “Rainbow Bird,”
Noel Coward’s v “Blythe Spirit,”
C. S. Forester’s “The Ship,”
Conrad’s “Typhoon” and A. E.
Housman’s poems.
Such a selection suggests
that the English course in
W.A. is more closely tied to
the student’s stage of maturity,
with the result that instead of
teaching in this subject being
less effective, as “D.J.G.”
claims it is elsewhere (B.
11/2/’59), it can now be made
more so. The student is
expected actually to think
about the work in hand instead
of absorbing a lot of second-
hand information in the form
of “prepared questions” to be
regurgitated under the com-
pulsion of the examination
clock.
If a survey of secondary
schools could be undertaken,
similar to that of the A.C.E.R.
in primary schools, the tend-
ency towards a realistic
approach in secondary educa-
tion could be carried further.
Then the progression from
primary to secondary educa-
tion could be made more
smoothly, and much that is
now taught in high-school
would undoubtedly be post-
poned to university.—L. R. M.
(W.A.).
Malleson and the Vic
The statement that “Miles
Malleson.... had never before
been associated with the
[Old] Vic” (B. 18/3/’59) is
incorrect. In 1950 I saw
Malleson in Moliere’s
“L’Avare” at the New Theatre,
London. He was in a season
of five plays given by the Old
Vic. — George Holman (Vic.).
South Coast Railway
One wonders whether the
politicians who promise to
build railways between Mary-
vale and Sandy Hollow, and
Inverell and Glen Innes (B.
25/2"/’59) —and various other
lines that will never pay their
way or serve great numbers of
people—have ever heard of
N.S.W.’s far South ( Coast, the
State’s biggest and richest area
without a railway.
Of course many lines have
been promised for this area,
but that is as far as they have
gone. Sir Henry Parkes was
the first to promise one—
indeed, he promised two. Back
in the ’eighties, just before an
election, he promised to extend
the South Coast line from
Nowra (Bomaderry) to Eden,
and ..also to extend the
Southern Monaro line, which
terminated at Cooma, down the
mountain to join the South
Coast line at Wolumla. The
South Coast line still termi-
nates at Bomaderry and the
Southern Monaro line was
extended in another direction
—to Bombala.
Now, if Cahill or Morton
had repeated Sir Henry’s
promises they would have been
talking . commonsense, and
might have got a few votes
from people who still believe in
political promises.
If the South Coast and
Monaro lines were extended —
with the junction at, say, Eden
—the people of this neglected
part of the State would have
something like reasonable
transport, and the State would
have at least two railway-lines
that would pay.
At present the area has no
transport-service at all. It once
had a reasonably good
shipping-service, but rising
costs forced owners to take
the little ships off. The South
Coast now has to rely on
privately owned buses and
coaches to get to the railway
at either Bomaderry or Bom-
bala, and on motor transport
to get their produce to market.
Butter, timber, maize, canned
fish, fresh fish, vegetables and
meat are just some of the
products of this part of the
country. Production of them
could and would be more than
doubled if the area had good
transport.
Some of Australia’s finest
tourist-resorts are on the coast
from Jervis Bay to the Vic-
torian border, but many of
them are little known because
the only way to get to them is
by private car. Much could
be made of the big-game
fishing which Zane Grey intro-
duced many years ago; and
South Coast tuna is the equal
of any in the world.
The aerodrome soon to be
opened at Merimbula will give
some relief, but not everyone
can afford to travel by air. Not
far away from Merimbula is
Eden, on Twofold Bay,
reckoned by experts to be
equal in every respect to Port
Jackson, but shockingly
neglected because there are no
railways to feed it. Inland
from Eden there are timber and
mineral resources hardly
touched. Eden could be made
the second-greatest port in the
State, and it might easily be
made the port and playground
for the Canberra of the future.
It only needs a politician with
a little foresight.—W.P.T.

Cop-and-ticket Justice
One of the top-brass of
Queensland’s Police Depart-
ment has brought back from
Yankidoodleland a new idea
about the administration of
justice which, it is reported,
will probably be introduced to
Brisbaners in May.
This do-it-yourself scheme
will require the establishment
of a fine-shop, to which will
troop in their hundreds all
those disobedient citizens who
have received tickets from the
cops for traffic-offences, there
to pay their fines and be given
a receipt.
At present traffic-offenders
are stated to be paying up to


£IOOO a day at the Brisbane
Clerk of Petty Sessions’ office,
and this has got the staff all
hot and bothered.
Of course, the fine-shop
patrons can always have
ordinary justice in respect of
their fines if they are prepared
to wait long enough for it.
It is anticipated that very
soon we shall be able to get
justice on the spot —by pay-
ing the fine to the cop. And
very soon after that, no doubt,
we shall be able to fix it with
the cop for all our more
serious misdemeanors and
felonies, and do away alto-
gether with these silly old
British courts of justice.—
Rosub (Q.).
Indonesia and West N.G.
Recent frank discussions
of our relations with Indo-
nesia and the future of West
New Guinea can do nothing
but good, provided a few
patches of hysteria are ignored
and prejudices on both sides
are allowed to disappear.
In the first place, we have
become, since the visit of the
Indonesian Foreign Minister,
Dr. Subandrio, much more
conscious of Indonesia as a
neighbor and an important one.
Secondly, we have begun to
reassess some aspects of Aus-
tralian security oh which we
have been tempted to accept
the beliefs of 20 years ago.
A lot of platitudes have been,
uttered, in and out of Parlia-
“Now, men —when crossing a bridge, always
BREAK STEP.”
ment, about the primary con-
sideration being the welfare of
the native people of West New
Guinea. Not much has been
said about any Dutch con-
tribution to our security, and
perhaps that is just as well.
Precious little has been said
about the chief object of our
concern, which is surely the
future security of this con-
tinent as part of the Asian area
and close to immense and in-
creasing populations. (Indo-
nesia has about 85-million now,
and estimates her territories
will soon hold 200-million. We
all know the disturbing esti-
mates of the Indian, Chinese
and Japanese populations.)
The fact seems to be that
the Menzies Government has
at last accepted, after years of
misgivings, the views which are
also now held in London and
Washington on the future of
the Moslem nation of Indcn
nesia as a barrier to Com-
munist aggression in this area.
Admittedly, there are
plenty of Communists in Indo-
nesia, as there are, or have
been, in Italy and France. This
doesn’t mean that their
sinister tricks can’t be cir-
cumvented by encouraging a
strong and economically stable
Indonesia to display what can
be accomplished by a non-
Communist regime ; nor does
it mean that at some time in the
future Indonesia and Aus-
tralia may find it impossible to
conclude a mutual pact against
aggression from elsewhere.
In other words, the present
understanding, as expressed in
the now-famous communique,
may lead to a degree of
security greater than Australia
has enjoyed since 1914. It is
the belief of most impartial
observers that a Dutch with-
drawal from West New Guinea
is likely to occur peaceably
within a decade perhaps
much earlier if the Indonesians
offer firm and useful induce-
ments, including reopened
doors for Dutch investments
in Indonesia.
Such a withdrawal would
apparently find Australia ex-
pressing its views (why?), but
offering no objections. The
end-result would be a satis-
fied Indonesia, and a closer

Teaching the Bright Child
When “St. Leger” (B.
18/3/’59) asks why we can’t
have special classes and special
teachers for specially gifted
pupils—in the same way as
we have them for retarded
pupils—he is, in effect, asking
that we should widen the
existing gap between the near-
genius and the normal child.
Our State education-system
is designed to minister to the
classroom needs of children
of average ability. Some
effort is expende'd upon those
below this level so as to close
the gap between the retarded
and the normal.
If, at the other end, we
expended special effort on
near-geniuses, then we’d only
succeed—if we did succeed at
all—in further separating the
specially gifted ones from
their fellows. It is therefore
inevitable, in any system of
free public schooling, that the
near-genius should be caught
in a kind of “psychic” trap.
There was no real reason
why the child “St. Leger”
described should have gone
overseas in search of a school
for near-geniuses. If his
parents hadn’t the means to
have him educated in a non-
State school he could presum-
ably have worked his way
through on scholarships—even
in the most expensive private
school in Australia.
There he would have been
“streamed”. according to
ability, and not necessarily
according to age, and he could
have gone right through and
out the other end—through
university and, if that didn’t
satisfy him, through post-
graduate work—all on scholar-
ships. I knew an Australian
lad who did all this, and some
more, too, while his father was
drawing the dole.
“St. Leger” asks what hap-
pens to the 1200-odd near-
geniuses who don’t go on to
university. Some, if scientifi-
cally bent, go into big firms
and spend their days working-
out formulae to enrich the
shareholders; some become
radiologists in hospitals ; some
work as backroom-boys in the
cosmetics industry; some be-
come teachers ; some journal-
ists ; a few (very few, I
imagine) politicians. One of
the brightest lads I ever had in
a Leaving class started work
as a railway-porter, and I’ve
no doubt he lived happily ever
after. —Ad Calcem Per-
VENIRE (Q.).
The Taxes of Virtue
From the House of Com-
mons “Hansard” (col, 239),
October 29, 1958:
A man and a woman fell in
love. The man was very able and
was earning £5OOO a year. The
woman he wished to marry was
“When We find her a mate, then We'll have the awful problem of finding her
a drainpipe with vacant possession."
earning £l5OO as an author. They
lealised that if they married they
would lose about £536 a year. So,
instead, they entered into a civil
contract, and the man agreed to
pay the woman a sum of £l5OO a
year, reducing his own income by
that sum, increasing hers by the
same amount, and saving in tax
£2OO a year net.
This is by no means the end of
the story. They were then £736 a
year better off, because if they had
married they would have lost £536,
since the tax situation on a covenant
such as that is not affected in the
case of a married couple. Twelve
months later twins were born and
they made a covenant, through
trustees, paying to each of these
children £250 a year less tax at
the standard rate. The Revenue
claimed that as these were illegiti-
mate children the covenants were
not valid.
This argument was not sustained
in the courts. So this couple made
another saving of £B7 a year. As
most of the tax on these covenants
was recoverable, they got back £2BB,
of course less the allowance of £B5
which they would have got if they
had been married. So altogether
they are now saving £1026 a year.
When the children are 21 years of
age the couple intend to marry, and
for 20 years they will have saved
£20,000, which they intend to settle
on the children.
If this doesn’t suggest that
not merely the methods, but
the entire philosophy and prin-
ciples of taxation at present
used, require revision, surely
nothing will. Fragmos

Prestige and Perspective
The international gathering
of scientists recently held in
Adelaide to discuss Antarctic
research issued a statement in
support of expanding present
activities in the icy south. Such
expansion, it was stated, might
cost £lOO million or more,
spread over a more-or-less
limited period, and would
entail participation in both
work and finance by all
interested nations.
During the past quarter-
century or more Australia’s
activities in Antarctica have
been significant and ever in-
creasing, until today its com-
mitments are incommensurate
with its population and im-
portance as a world Power.
In addition to the scientific
bases on Mawson and Davis
lands, and the stations on Mac-
quarie Island, we have accepted
the generous offer of the U.S.
base on Wilkesland, together
with a lot of splendid equip-
ment, which, however, requires
a supply of Australian scientific
personnel.
Commitments in Antarctica
call for an administrative staff
in Canberra directly respon-
sible to the Minister for
External Affairs, who is also
the Ministerial head of
C.S.T.R.O. The latter organisa-
tion has amply justified its
existence and every penny of
its cost. Can this be said of the
Antarctic establishment?
Here we are, about 10-
million of us, with more
essential developmental jobs in
front of us and with pressing
social problems internal
communications, water - con-
servation, flood - mitigation,
schools, hospitals, and settle-
ment howling for action,
while millions of pounds and
much scientific effort are being
spent on biological and
meteorological problems in a
continent the size of Brazil or
the U.S.
Of course Antarctica is a
great field for such research ;
so is space. But, as the British
Prime Minister said during a
debate in the Commons last
year, “This country [U.K.] has
too many demands of a press-
ing nature upon its resources
to enter the lists with countries
with the necessary wealth to
devote to them.” This is the
outlook of a statesman capable
of putting his country’s needs
in true perspective against
the shadowy background of
prestige. Fred Aarons
(N.S.W.).

TREE-PLANTING
[From H. A. LINDSAY]
At a three-day school on
tree-growing, held by the
Waite Institute, Adelaide, in
collaboration with the South
Australian Department of
Woods and Forests, discussion
covered many points, of which
these are a summary:
The ’earthenware flowerpot
is “out” for raising young
seedlings. It’s likely to cause
crowded roots, from which a
young tree may never recover.
Seedlings should be raised in
tubes, made by rolling a piece
of wood-veneer Ift. wide
round a smooth piece of wood
2in. in diameter, fastening it
with a couple of twine-ties,
slipping it off, and packing it
with earth. Before planting-
out, soak the soil inside with
water to hold it on the roots,
and remove tube by cutting
the ties.
Quite large trees can be
transplanted. In the autumn
before they are to be moved
drive a sharp spade down to
cut all the roots in a circle of
18in. radius from the trunk.
The roots grow again in a net
of fibres, and there’s no check
when the tree is transplanted.
A stake as support for a
young ■’ tree is also “out.”
Repeated tests have proved
that ability to sway in the wind
is necessary for sound, strong
trunk-development. Further,
friction against rope-ties and
the top of the stake causes
scarring and produces a weak
spot at which the young tree
is liable to snap in a high
wind.
Never let a young tree
develop a Y-fork, as distinct
from normal side-branching.
Sooner or later a split is liable
to run down the trunk from
this fork and ruin the tree.
Side-twigs should not be
pruned off a tree until it has
attained a good thickness of
trunk. If it belongs to a species
which naturally develops a
clean trunk, they will die and
drop off in their own good
time. Otherwise, they are
necessary for sound develop-
ment.
For shelter-belts, growth
right down to the ground is
necessary, so use species whose
lower branches do not die off
naturally. Stock must be
fenced-out.
Forget the old idea of plant-
ing young trees in holes con-
taining animal-manure and
leafmould. That only creates
ideal conditions for such root-
eating pests as the cockchafer-
grub, Plant-food for the first
year is best supplied by mixing
into the soil a handful of
super. with trace-elements
added.
In wet localities bank-up a
low mound and plant the
seedling in its centre. In areas
of medium and low rainfall
make a shallow saucer-shaped
depression up to 6ft. in
diameter ; keep free of weeds.
In drier country split open an
old paper cement-bag, lay it on
the cleared patch, make a hole
in the centre, plant the
seedling through it, and hold
down the edges of the paper
with stones or earth. This acts
as a mulch, keeps down weed-
growth and directs water from
summer rain to where it will
do most good.
Plant deciduous trees at least
three weeks before bud-burst,
evergreens with the first
autumn rain, and those of the
sub-tropical type, such as
jacaranda and flame-tree, after
October.
In arid country a 4in.-layer
of creek-shingle or broken
gravel makes an excellent
mulch around a young tree.
Where a paddock is treeless
except for an odd native pine,
gumtree or casuarina, a grove
of trees can be grown without
much' effort. Enclose the parent
tree with a stockproof and
rabbitproof fence. Leave the
rest to Nature, and within a
few years there will almost
certainly be a dense regenera-
tion inside the fence. Surplus
trees should be removed. When
saplings are tall enough to be
safe from damage by stock
take down the fence and let
the stock use the grove for
shade and shelter.
The Canary Island pine will
grow in country too dry for
radiata, and. has the advantage
of recovering after a fire, even
one severe enough to burn off
all the foliage.
Groves of shade-trees, with
windbreak belts along the
edges of paddocks, beautify a
property, and also bring
higher returns from stock,
crops and pastures.
Chinese Competition
“Pieter Nuyts”: The South
African “Deciduous Fruit
Grower” sounds a warning on
fruit-production in China,
present and planned. It
describes the rate of planting
apple-trees there as fantastic,
and warns that the varieties on
which China is concentrating
for large-scale production are
those most favored by South
African growers—Jonathan,
Red Delicious and Golden
Delicious.
From figures available, and
from China’s national and
scientific approach to all
aspects of agriculture, the

journal concludes that within
a few years China could
become one of the world’s
principal fruit-exporters.
If that prospect is alarming
to South Africa it must be
even more so to Australia. The
South Africans have a big geo-
graphical advantage over us
in the highly and increasingly
competitive European market,
so they'd be that much more
able to compete against
Chinese competition. We’re
already finding it hard enough
to place our surplus fruits in
South-east Asia. If Australian
growers and exporters are to
face this threat, either in
Europe or Asia, they have to
find ways of marketing their
fruit at considerably lower
costs.
No doubt there are ways in
which individual growers can
reduce costs, but these won’t
have any .worth-while general
effect. Fruitgrowing is a
national industry, worth mil-
lions, while fruit-exporting is
a source of income to the
nation and to some of our big-
gest industries, like case-
factories and shipping. So it’s
nationally important that the
fruitgrowing industry should
be preserved, which means that
this new threat must be tackled
on a national level.
This calls for immediate top-
level consultation between all
interests involved growers,
exporters, shipping companies,
sawmillers, trade-unions and
the Government —to find ways
of reducing costs. I don’t
know how costs can be
reduced ; that’s for the con-
ference to say. But somehow
or other Australian fruit must
reach the markets at a cost
enabling it to compete with
fruit from other countries with
lower standards of living.
Western know-how should be
able to do this, but a start must
be made immediately.
Sheep's Burnet
“Wilga”: Sheep’s burnet
(P oter i u m sanguisorba), a
perennial growing to 2ft., has
a long tap-root which pene-
trates deeply into loose soils
and enables the plant to with-
stand long dry spells without
losing condition.
A native of Great Britain,
the plant does well in the
poorer and shallow soils of the
tablelands and slopes of N.S.W.
and Victoria; it will not
endure the extreme summer
conditions of the far inland.
It thrives in limestone country,
and in what are locally termed
“loose granitic soils.”
The plant flourishes where
lucerne will not grow without
irrigation, produces nutritious
herbage for sheep and cattle,
and stands heavy stocking
over a number of years.
During an extensive trial at
the Bathurst (N.S.W.) Experi-
mental Farm some years ago
seed was sown in the autumn,
in drills 18in. apart, at 151 b.
to the acre. Although dry
weather set-in, it grew well, and
was fed-off by sheep several
times during spring and
summer.
Sheep’s burnet remains green
throughout the year. When
young it’s an excellent fodder-
plant, but if allowed to -be-
come old it turns woody and
unpalatable. It is used exten-
sively in permanent pastures ;
41b. to 61b. of seed an acre
mixed with the grasses and
sown preferably in March and
April.
Rabbit-control
“MacMuirick”: No biologi-
cal measure can take over from
myxomatosis: this point has
been made constantly by the
C.5.1.R.0., graziers, Depart-
ments of Agriculture, wool
firms and chemical companies
—all closely interested in the
problem of rabbit-control.
The symposium held in
Melbourne last year by the
C.5.1.R.0. advocated extension
of conventional methods of
control, such as use of 1080.
This poison, though generally
regarded as new, was in fact
developed during War II: it
was used in the Philippines in
1952 to destroy rats —an esti-
mated 21-million were wiped-
out in the two months of the
campaign.
Odorless and tasteless, 1080
has a bad name with many
people who have read about
it, but the only risk to humans
is during the actual formula-
tion. Firms preparing the baits
take extraordinary precautions
—workers wear overalls, masks
and goggles and work in teams
to ensure maximum safety.
A human-being would have
to consume b. of the baited
oats to get a fatal dose. But
a meal of 2jlb. of the oats
would mean eating 36,000
grains at a sitting, near ,enough
to a physical impossibility.
Cattle and sheep are more
susceptible ; 2oz. would kill a
601 b. sheep and lib. would kill
a 6001 b. beast. Normal pre-
cautions, such as keeping the
paddock clear of stock till rain
falls, will reduce risk to a
minimum.
Aeroplanes have proved
useful for bait-laying. Accord-
ing to figures quoted by one
firm, this method can be used
at the comparatively low cost
of 345. an acre. Bait is laid in
a one-acre strip, with grains
spreading out over an addi-
tional two acres on each side
of the plane. Thus the cost
for one acre actually influences
three acres, giving a net cost
of 12s. Considerable baiting
of this type has been done in
New Zealand and Victoria,
with great success. Firms con-
sider that aerial baiting should
be as a supplement to ground
bait-laying. Difficult country,
like bracken, scrub and gullies,
which give ideal cover for the
pests, are ideal for aerial
control-measures. Aerial bait-
ing now has official approval,
and a big campaign is expected
in the near future.
The lethal dose for a rabbit
is 10 grains of oats, which will
kill in 4j hours ; 50 grains will
kill in one hour. Tests have'
proved that in the field a rabbit
will eat 200 grains in a night.
Pittman Technique
Before the experiment in
pasture-establishment, which I
undertook at the Haunted
Hills, Moe (Vic.), and out-
lined in B. 3/12/’5B, the 40-
acre area sown-down in June,
1958, by the Pittman technique
was described by Country-
party leader Sir Herbert
Hyland as able to “carry one
snake to the acre, and a small
snake at that.”
At various times since,
tributes have been paid to the
success of the establishment
and growth of pasture on this
hungry acid soil. But none has
been jnore sincere than that
which I have just received
from my landlords, the State
Electricity Commissioners, who
have requested me to give
“....my immediate attention
to the removal of the excess
pasture growth present on the
area.”
After the initial success of
the experiment, which was
apparent by early October, die-
hards predicted that the
pasture would have all dis-
appeared by the end of summer.
But in spite of one of the
hottest and driest summers on
record, the pasture is flourish-
ing. It is quite capable of
supporting “the one beast to
two acres within six months”
predicted by Mr. Pittman, and
stands as an inspiration to all
owners of poor acid soils. Since
these constitute something over

(19/3/’59)
Queensland should receive reasonably good rains during
April, with heavy falls and flooding on the north and part
of the central districts. Rainfall may be poor in the far west
and far south-west areas. Light to moderate patchy rains
may be expected in May and June.
N.S.W. should have moderate general rains during
April, although rainfall may be light in part of the Riverina
and along the Darling. Heavy rains are indicated on the
central and mid-north coastal districts and part of the
Hunter River Valley; these rains may be associated with
cyclonic activity off the central coast. Light to moderate
rains are indicated in May and June, with well-distributed
rains for the balance of the year.
In Victoria, the Mallee, Wimmera and northern districts
may have only light to moderate rains during April, although
good rains should be received in the central division, Gipps-
land and the north-east and west coast districts.
Rainfall in South Australia may be patchy, varying
from light to moderate, during April, although good rains
should start in the agricultural areas in the latter half of
May.
Poor rainfall is probable in most of Western Australia
during April, although in May good rains should fall in
the agricultural areas.

Coffee
“Sandpatch”: “Narea’s” par.
on coffee (B. 11/3/’59) brought
back memories of Byron Bay
(N.S.W.) and the berries Fred
Wareham grew at Koreelah
from 1900 to 1920.
His home stood on a ridge
of sand, superimposed on clay.
Along one side of the drive-
way up the hill to the house
were coffee-bushes. Each year
the berries were harvested,
soaked for three days, and
then the beans were pushed
by hand from their surround-
ing fibre, dried in the shade
and packed in sugar-bags, each
labelled with the year of har-
vest. Bush rats have a liking
for prepared coffee-beans, so
each bag was hung from the
rafter of a shed by a piece of
fencing-wire.
When I first went to Byron
Bay in 1911 the Wareham
family was using coffee grown
and harvested in 1907. From
time to time a supply would
be roasted, in a baking-dish or
simply in a large fryingpan on
top of the stove. 1 found the
brew excellent.
Now, with ground-coffee
selling at 10s. a pound, I
wonder more N.S.W. North
Coast farmers don’t grow their
own and reduce living-costs.
Preparation of the beans is a
job children can do, and hung
in hessian bags in a draught
of air the beans keep almost
indefinitely. When I returned
from the war in 1919 1 found
the family had not caught-up
with the 1915 harvest.
The plants are attractive in
a garden and do not occupy
much room —on the sandy soil
at Byron Bay they grow to a
maximum of 6ft. In my
opinion, they are best grown
on light soils. As “Narea”
says, on the rich moulds of
volcanic soils of the North
the trees grow up to 20ft. —
and then provide problems in
picking, while the flavor is
poor compared with that of
the sandy-soil product. I have
sampled coffee grown near
Cairns (Q.), and do not think
it compares with that produced
at Byron Bay.
There are two essentials—
adequate drainage and plenty
of water. Once established,
weeds are no problem, and
1 don’t remember any pests
attacking the coffee-bushes at
Byron Bay except a leaf-cutting
insect. Those grown at Koree-
lah were much closer-spaced
than 20ft; I would think no
more than 6ft. Grown like
that, they make an attractive
hedge, and a light pruning will
keep them from going wild.
At Byron Bay we raised seed-
lings in jam-tins, transplanting
when Ift. high.
Poultry and Minerals
“Billjim”: Many of the ills
from which poultry suffer can
be traced to lack or deficiency
of various minerals, chiefly
“Try it again with a broader vowel: ‘The rain in Spain
stays mainly on the plains .’
calcium, phosphorus, sodium,
chlorine and manganese.
Maximum value is obtained
from calcium and phosphorus
only when they are balanced
in the right proportions. A
ratio of H to 2 of calcium and
1 of phosphorus is suitable for
chickens, and 2t to 3 of cal-
cium and 1 of phosphorus for
layers.
The most common forms
of calcium are oystershell and
limestone, either as grit or
ground to powder. With nor-
mal good rations, 2 per cent,
of ground-limestone or oyster-
shell in the diet will be enough.
Where grains, meatmeal and
milk-products are regularly fed
there will be no shortage of
phosphorus. Wheat-offals are
a good source of manganese,
and where these form a large
part of the ration a supplement
won’t be necessary. However,
a diet containing a large pro-
portion of cereal grains, either
ground or whole, is likely to
be deficient in manganese. A
high level of bone- or meat-
meal will boost the intake of
phosphorus and create a need
for more manganese, which
can be obtained with the
addition of hydrated
manganese-sulphate to every
ton of the ration. The diffi-
culty of mixing such a small
-amount through the food can
be overcome by pre-mixing.
The addition of common
salt meets the needs of poultry
for sodium and chlorine.
Usually j per cent, added to
the ration will be enough, but
if fish-meal makes up 10 per
cent, of the ration no salt is
needed.
Insoluble grit, like stones
and coarse sand, are important
in poultry-nutrition, acting as
a grinding and crushing agent,
reducing large particles of food
and separating fine particles, so
that digestive juices can pene-
trate and work efficiently.
Landrace Pigs
“Bacon”: A publicity
splurge says that Landrace pigs
are smashing world-records.
But, as well as information on
weight of the pigs at a given
age, I think we are entitled to
know what feed they have con-
sumed to reach these record-
breaking figures. I have pro-
duced 501 b. pigs at eight weeks,
but the feedbill ate into the
profits.
Anyway, it seems to me
doubtful if Landrace pigs have
a big future in our climate—
certainly in the inland areas.
They are very sensitive to the
hot sun, and the fact that they
are the world’s best foragers
could be offset thereby. Our
summer is hot, and I have seen
the red-and-black pig burn
after being put from deep-
litter to range.
Preserving Apples
“Myall”: Queensland Agri-
cultural Department officers
have developed a storage-
method which keeps Granny
Smith apples in good internal
condition until mid-December.
A drawback is that gases
used in the treatment cause a
superficial scald, and the
experimenters are now* working
on methods to counteract this.
The aim is to be able to put
apples on the market as crisp
and fresh as if just picked, even
after nine months’ storage.
They already know that
impregnating the 'wrapping-
paper with diphenyiamine will
prevent the trouble, but they’ve
yet to prove that it will have
no harmful effect on humans.
As well as seeking a means of
removing traces of dipheny-
larnine after the fruit is taken
from storage, they’re experi-
menting with over 30 other
chemicals to see if any of these
will control the scald.
Cow-pox
“Agricola”: Some herds
have up to 50 per cent, of the
cows affected by cow-pox, a
disease caused by a virus which
can be carried from cow to
cow by the milker's hands or
by machines. Several recent
cases were traced to a shed-
hand stripping a cow with cow-
pox, then not washing his
hands, and so passing on the
infection.
In hand-milking days cow-
pox was as common as the
everyday cold. Now it appears
in sudden waves, sometimes
years apart. Symptoms are:
first, a rash on the teats and
round the base of the udder ;
then small pimples, which
point and discharge. The dis-
charge is at first clear and
watery, then turns to pus.
Scabs form over the sores and
heal slowly.
There is little complication
with cow-pox. It runs its

course slowly, and general
health of the cow is seldom
affected.
All unaffected cows should
be milked first. Hands should
be washed before each cow is
stripped, or, better still, strip-
ping should be done by
machine, with the cups dipped
in a steriliser, such as chlorine.
Treatment must be prompt
and must continue till the
trouble is cured. Before the
cow is milked wash the teats
and udder in cold water with
a dairy-steriliser added. After
milking, wash them again to
remove any milk which may
dry and cause them to crack.
Then rub sulphathiazole or
other antibiotic ointment into
the teats, particularly when-
ever they show pimples or
scabs. In a severe outbreak
cows can be vaccinated, but
this is seldom necessary if the
trouble is tackled properly
from the start. One attack
generally gives a cow lifetime
immunity.
Leaf-eating Ladybird
“North”: Most species of
ladybirds help farmers and
orchardists, but the leaf-eating
variety does great damage and
must be controlled.
Oval in shape and about yin.
long, the insect is yellowish-
brown and has wing-covers
marked with black spots. It is.
sluggish, seldom uses its wings,
and its life-cycle is completed
in four or five weeks.
Potato-plants and those of
the tomato, pumpkin and other
vine-vegetables are Its prey. It
often destroys the leaves totally,
and damages the stems.
Unlike most insects, all
stages of its life occur on the
stems and leaves, so it may be
present on the host-plant in all
degrees of development at the
one time. While the larvae feed
on the underside of the leaves
the adults get busy on the upper
surfaces. Between them they
leave only a network of veins,
covered with a thin, whitish
film. Larvae may also attack
the skin of the fruit.
Control varies with the type
of plant attacked. For tomatoes
and potatoes, try 0.2 per
cent. D.D.T.-spray, applied at
14-day intervals, or dusting with
2 per cent. D.D.T.-dust. Since
D.D.T. is injurious to vine-
vegetable plants, replace it for
them with 25 per cent, arsenate-
of-lead powder, mixed with an
equal quantity of fine hydrated-
lime, which should be dusted on
the plants in the early morning.
For full control of the insect
in all three stages of growth,
take care to treat both sides of
the leaves with the chosen
remedy.
Field-carrot
“Myall”: The field-carrot is
hardy and prolific, with a root
which is good for fattening
cattle and sheep and increasing
the milk-flow of dairy-cows.
It thrives in deep, sandy
loams, but does well in any
rich, friable, well-drained soil,
though not in stiff clay and
stony ground. The soil should
be ploughed deeply and
brought to a fine tilth if the
roots are to penetrate easily
and attain their full develop-
ment.
Carrots respond to fertilis-
ing, and a mixture of 8 parts
super., 2 parts sulphate-of-
ammonia and 1 part sulphate-
of-potash, applied at the rate
of scwt. an acre, will give good
results. Seed may be sown
from May to October, and
should be drilled-in very
thinly, in rows 2ft. apart,
lightly covered with soil (41b.
of seed is sufficient for an
acre).
As soon as the seedlings are
above the surface a light horse-
scarifier should be put between
the rows, to destroy any
weeds and loosen-up the soil.
This should be repeated several
times during early growth.
Thinning is not necessary, but,
if wished, plants can be spaced
about 6in. apart in the rows.
This allows the roots to
develop into fine proportions.
When mature, they may be
pulled as required. If the land
is needed for immediate re-
cropping, lift the carrots care-
fully, cut their tops off, and
store them in pits covered with
earth, until wanted for use.
A good crop of carrots will
yield from 20 tons to 25 tons
of roots to the acre. The best
varieties for fodder are Altring-
ham (a large orange root) and
white Belgian (a productive,
large, white variety). When
deciding on the variety, re-
member that the price of
carrots is often high, and if
table-varieties, like Scarlet
Intermediate or Red-Cored
Chantenay, are grown, they
may return a r_>od profit.
Crosscuts
“A.C.T.”: Construction of
a prototype machine for the
mechanical harvesting of sugar-
cane is well advanced. The
Department of Primary Indus-
try, financed jointly by the
Federal Government and the
canegrowers, has evolved a new
design, “based on a funda-
mentally new principle of cane-
handling.” It’s down for test
next August or September. A
harvester imported from the
U.S.A. proved capable of cut-
ting cane at a fast rate, but
only in special conditions.
“C.A.A.”: D. A. Steele, of
Freshwater Creek, near Gee-
long (Vic.), winner of the
municipal and Country Fire
Authority trophies for the
property most immune from
fire-risk, had a pipe-fence
round the homestead and out-
buildings capable of throwing
a wall of water 30ft. high.
Not content with ploughing
and burning breaks to protect
haystacks and conserved
fodder, he used weedkiller
round the perimeter to keep
the area free from grass-
hazard, and all his fuel-supplies
were located in underground
tanks.

parts of Australia have dis-
covered —in particular when
snap classification has to be
made in the yards or shed,
or in the paddock, with a
type, perhaps, outside the
main run of your experience.
There’s a big difference be-
tween knowing and guessing.

How are slow-motio'n pictures
made ?
(From Cinesound Productions
Pty., Ltd.) The world standard for
motion-picture photography and
projection is to take 24 pictures a
second and project at this speed
for normal action. With slow-
motion pictures, the action is taken
at speeds ,up to 144 pictures (or
frames), depending on the desired
degree of “slow-motion.” When
action is photographed at 144
frames per second, then projected
at the normal speed of 24 frames
per second, the action is slowed
down accordingly—in this case, six
times. Special cameras operating
at speeds of thousands of frames
a. second are used in laboratories
to study the flight and impact of
bullets, etc.

How is the card-game “Beggar
My Neighbor” played ?
The full pack is divided equally
between two players, and the cards
are held with the backs upwards.
The first player lays down his top
card face-up, and the opponent
plays his top card on it. This goes
on alternately as long as no court-
card appears, but if either player
turns-up an ace or a court-card his
opponent has to play four ordinary
cards to an ace, three to a king,
two to a queen and one to a knave.
When he has done so the other
player takes all the cards on the
table and places them under his
pack. If, however, in the course
of this playing to a court-card
another court-card turns-up, the
adversary must in turn play to this,
and as long as neither has played
a full number of ordinary cards
to any court-card the trick con-
tinues. The player who gets all
"It's the hammerhead-model, madam — a
real man- killer!”
the cards into his hand is the
winner.

How is coconut-flesh dried and
copra made ?
There are various methods of
drying the flesh. Sun-drying is
done by putting the split nut on
a wire frame. When the flesh is
quite dried by the sun a knife is
slipped around the inside of the
shell and the copra falls out. In
kiln-drying the flesh of the coconut
is put in an oven and left until
dried. Another method of drying
is to place either the split nuts or
flesh only on shelves in a shed, with
powerful electric fans supplying a
strong drying current of air. With
smoke-drying, the flesh is removed
from the shell by a knife and
placed on wire or split-bamboo
frames about 4ft. from the ground;
fires are lit underneath, using fibre
and green leaves as fuel. This
method can be worked either in a
shed or in the open.

Biographical information about
Oscar Straus ?
Born in Vienna on March 6,
1870, he studied with Hermann
Gradener and Max Bruch in
Berlin, and was theatrical conductor
in various towns. In 1927 he went
to live in America. He wrote some
works for orchestra and several
operas, the most successful of which
was “Das Tal der Liebe,” but he
became best-known as a composer
of Viennese operettas. His
operettas include “A Waltz Dream”
(first produced in Vienna in 1907
and in London the folowing year),
“The Chocolate Soldier” (Vienna,
1908, and London 1910), “Love
and Laughter” (written for the
London stage and produced
at the Lyric Theatre, London, in
Sept., 1913), “The Dancing
Viennese,” “The Last Waltz,”
“Cleopatra,” “Mother of Pearl” and
“Riquette.” He died on January
11, 1954.

Details, including distinctive
features, of the Warragamba River
(N.S.W.f, which will be controlled
by the great dam to be completed
shortly.
The Nepean and Warragamba
Rivers junction about a mile west
of Wallacia. The Warragamba's
catchment-area extends from Lake
Bathurst on the south to Wallera-
wang on the north, from Robertson
on the east to Crookwell in the
west. The native words “warra”
and “gamba” mean respectively
swamp and tea-tree, and possibly the
name stems from an old tea-tree
swamp now no longer in existence.
The name Warragamba, which
Governor Macquarie in 1810
directed should be retained, applies
only to the 14 miles of river.from
the junction of the Cox’s and
Wollondilly Rivers (these two being
the main sources of supply) to its
confluence with the Nepean. Other
tributaries include the Nattai and
Wingecarribbee. The Warra-
gamba's feature is that
its course consists of a sandstone
gorge approx. 1000 ft. wide, with
sides 300-400 ft. high adjoining the
Nepean, widening to 2000 ft. near
the point of junction with its two
chief tributaries. Above this the
valley opens out widely, forming
the Burragorang Valley.

Particulars of the Kiscli affair of
the 1930’5?
In November, 1934, Egon Kisch,
a Czechoslovak Communist writer,
was refused entry to Australia
because of his political associations.
He landed, however, by jumping
ashore at Port Melbourne from the
ship in which he came out. He
was immediately arrested, and given
a dictation-test in Gaelic. He failed
to pass, and was declared a pro-
hibited immigrant. He appealed,
and the High Court held (1) that
Gaelic was not a European language
within the meaning of Section 3a of
the Immigration Restriction Act of
1901, and that therefore the test
did not comply with the require-
ments of the Act and was invalid;
and (2) that the information con-
cerning Kisch’s political beliefs had
not been received through official
or diplomatic channels as was
required by the Immigration Act.
Kisch was freed, given another
dictation-test in a European
language which complied with the
court’s ruling, again failed to pass
the test, was again declared a pro-
hibited immigrant and deported
(leaving Australia in March, 1935).

Has Australia the world’s deepest
caves ?
No. France holds that distinc-

exploration, a party of French
scientists established that the laby-
rinth of caves known as Dent de
Crolles, near Grenoble, extended
3193 ft. into a 6776 ft. peak in the
Claude Chartreuse Range. This is
70ft. deeper than the Great Hole
of Preta, in Italy, which up till then
had been regarded as the deepest.

What was the Porteous Riot ?
In September, 1736, at Edinburgh,
R. C. Porteous was captain of the
city guard. At the execution of a
smuggler named Wilson he ordered
the guard to fire on the mob which
were getting out of hand, six
persons being killed and 11
wounded. Porteous was condemned
to death, but reprieved, whereupon
the mob burst into the jail where
he was confined, dragged him to
the Grassmarket (the usual place
of execution) and hanged him in
torchlight to a barber’s-pole. Scott

Some information on the career
of Kennerley Rum ford ?
The English baritone was born
at Hampstead, London, in 1870.
He studied under George Henschel
and Alfred Blume in London, mak-
ing his debut in 1893. From
1894-96 he continued studies in
Paris, after which he returned to
London to sing in concerts and
festivals. In 1900 he married the
famous contralto Clara Butt, with
.whom he toured the U.S. in 1913.
A world tour' was interrupted by
the outbreak of World War I, in
which Rumford served in British
Military Intelligence. After the war
he and his wife resumed their con-
cert tours. Though not in the first
flight of baritones, he nevertheless
used with fine artistry a voice of
good timbre.

SYDNEY
Some of the 800 young people who
attended the Broad Brimmers’ Ball at the
Trocadero had flown over 500 miles
specially to be present —which seemed
rather appropriate, as the function was
in aid of the Flying Doctor Service. The
Trocadero was elaborately decorated
with gum - leaves, sundowners, tractors,
ploughs, alligators, jackeroos, signposts
to Dead Dog Creek, Come By Chance,
etc., and the whitened bones of drought-
stricken animals which nobody seemed
to mind. The Governor and Lady Wood-
ward were present. Young president
Penelope Breakell wore white faille em-
broidered with chalk-white and silver.
Secretary Judith Kater was in bouffant
white tulle with midnight-blue velvet
bodice. Others who helped to make this
new Easter dance a first-rate success were
Jane Horniman, Mary Barber and
Gordon McMaster (Boonooke, North
Hay), whose partner Heather Makepeace
(Hay) wore a pretty dress of green satin.

A scheme of vivid peacock-feathers
and attractive table-decorations added to
the gaiety of the Town and Country Ball
held at Prince’s in aid of the Smith
Family. Mrs. Clinton Ayers, the presi-
dent, wore a pretty dress of champagne
organza with the striking contrast of
emerald-green satin shoes, and committee-
member Mrs. John Trenerry looked
graceful in white French chiffon. Lynne
Beeinan (Roseville) brought along a
large party of young things, including
her cousin Jacqueline Reynolds (Goul-
burn), Barbara and Margot Oates
(Orange), Peter Graney, Knox O’Neill,
Roger Webster and David Clements.
Mrs. Keith Fisher entertained in her
party the Frank Frasers, of “Dundee,”
Richmond (Q.), and among the most
attractive tables was that of Mr. and Mrs.
M. V. Point (Castlecrag), who used their
racing-colors (orange-and-black) in
models of the Harbor Bridge and a
country church.

A birthday of distinction during the
week was that of Sydney newspaper-
woman Miss Fanny Marlay, who at 91
still views this city’s activities with a
reporter’s eye and holds the position of
social-secretary to a leading firm of
photographers.
Miss Marlay (her married name was
Mrs. A. H. T. Beebe) was born at
“Clifton,” Darling Downs (Q.). It was at
Toowoomba as a teacher of singing that
she met Madam - Melba, the first of a
long list of world-famous celebrities with
whom her newspaper work brought her
in contact. Also at Toowoomba she
made the acquaintance of Dame Clara
Butt and Mr. Kennedy Rumford, and
she recalls presenting to the former, after
one of her recitals, a muff of fresh
violets.
During her long newspaper-career with
the “Evening News,” the “Sun” and the
“Telegraph” (from which she retired at
70) Miss Marlay met nearly every
celebrity who came to this city—Melba
again, Galli Curci (“with her canaries”)
and “Dear little Pavlova, almost over-
whelmed by the protectiveness of her
husband.” There are very few of Sydney’s
social doings with which she is not
familiar, and on her birthday she greeted
a continuous stream of friends, among
them many of Sydney's best-known news-
paper women.
Judy Valentine, daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. W. M. Valentine, of Wollstonecraft,
recently returned from an interesting trip
abroad. For several months Judy lived
with a French family, with whom she
perfected her knowledge of the language;
later, after touring England, she left by
bus for Calcutta. Thence she flew to
Bombay and sailed for home in the
Strathnaver. Photo by Norton Trevaire.
Mr. John O’Grady, author of They’re
a Weird Mob, was guest-of-honor at this
-month’s luncheon of the Society of
Women Writers. His theme was “People
and Places,” his aim to show how from
a chance phrase (example, “It was so hot
1 got bogged in the bitumen”) one could
construct a character and build up a
story. He also gave a hint that the next
couple of weeks would see arrangements
made for the filming of his best-seller.
The society’s new president, Miss Beryl
Guertner, was chief welcomer, chair-
woman, etc., Mrs. Gwen Morton-Spencer
said the “Thank-you” speech to the guest-
of-honor, and Mrs. Toby Browne was
pressed into telling that she plans to
reverse the habit of “selling Australia
short” (of which so many of us are
guilty) on her forthcoming trip abroad.

CANBERRA
Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone,
opened the autumn flower-show of the
Canberra Horticultural Society at the
Albert Hall. Her Royal Highness made
an attractive picture wearing a cream-
and-lavender floral-silk frock and small
hat of pink and lilac leaves, when she
addressed the crowded hall. The official
party, which included Lady Slim and
Lady Dixon, was welcomed by the presi-
dent, Mr. R. S. Boardman, and conducted


to the stage, where a miniature garden
of shrubs, colorful begonias and roses
had been created. Princess Alice is a
keen gardener, and she said she was never
happier than when in the company of
fellow-gardeners. She was delighted
when Mr. Boardman presented her with
a copy of the society’s publication “The
Canberra Gardener,” bound in blue
leather and trimmed in gold.
Among the beautiful display of flowers
the dahlias were most prominent, the
Thurbon Trophy going to Mr. and Mrs.
I. Widdowson for a lovely white speci-
men. The roses, too, caught the eye, and
Mr. W. Bennett took full honors for a
bowl of dark-red blooms. An attractive
low-arrangement by Mrs. Boardman
comprising two Japanese Golden Ray
lilies in a floating-bowl was much
admired, as was a novel exhibit by Mrs.
J. Hurrell of a miniature garden in a
brandy-balloon.

merchants and . industrialists were
reconciled because, when the Gov-
ernment took over their businesses, it
put them in charge of them; and he
says that even some of the most
prominent leaders and aristocrats from
former times —notably Prince Tsai
Tao, the younger brother of the
Emperor Kuang Hsu, and General Li
Chi-shen, once responsible for a
notable massacre of Communists in
Canton were reconciled because,
“profiting by Russia’s mistakes,” the
Government forgave them their errors
(after they had admitted them in writ-
ing and enjoyed some three years’
“instruction”) and gave them high
positions.
On the Formosa question, Profes-
sor Fitzgerald discusses the possibility
that even Chiang Kai-shek could con-
ceivably be reconciled on similar
terms;, though he seems to think that
other solutions, such as the formation
of an independent Republic of
Formosa which, ruled by Chiang,
would not claim the overlordship of
the mainland, are more likely. He
says that nobody believes for a
moment that Chiang will get back to
the mainland unless (as Chiang hopes)
in a Third World War, and that ulti-
mately the question of Formosa will
be decided by the Formosans them-
selves who, if the Revolution continues
to prosper, will most likely want to
join in . as will others of China’s
neighbors.
He says that painting in Chinese
traditional style is encouraged as well
as the distressing “social realism” they
got from Russia; that writers are free
to discuss anything except the basic
beliefs of Communism (which he finds
somewhat limiting). All the flies and
most of the dogs are dead; the trains
run on time; everyone is clean and
moral; and perhaps the most
genuinely soothing fact of all —the
Chinese got as big a shock as everyone
else did to find that their population
was approaching 600-million, and the
Government is now advocating birth-
control throughout the country.
Education Through Art
Edited by Bernard Smith, with an
introduction by Herbert Read, Educa-
tion Through Art in Australia (Mel-
bourne University Press) is a book
that arose from a Unesco seminar held
in Melbourne in 1954. In part it is
theoretical, in part practical; and all of
it will be of great interest to art-
teachers throughout the country.
Joseph Burke, Desiderius Orban,
O. A. Oeser, Daryl Lindsay, Gordon
Thomson, Hal Missingham and
others contribute essays on the theory
of teaching and appreciation; and at
the end are accounts of the 1959 art-
syllabus for Victorian schools, of art-
education in other States, and of the
resolutions adopted by the seminar.
For example:—
“This seminar recommends that
art should be accorded equal status
in the schools with all other subjects
... .The [secondary schools] syllabus
should provide a broad and balanced
course of work in two and three
dimensions (i.e., in drawing, painting,
modelling and carving) set against a
background of historical studies....
Art-syllabuses [primary schools]
should emphasise the creative aspect
of art-education and should present
a challenge to the child’s inventive-
ness.”
If there is a weakness in the book,
and the case which it presents, it is a
tendency for many-of the contributors
to overemphasise the “creative aspect”
at the expense of the “broad and bal-
anced course of work”: in short, to
have another crack at poor old
Drawing.
Parts of it remind this commentator
of those hearty, prosperous, well-
meaning souls who used to come
around the schools assuring everyone
that it didn’t matter if they hadn’t any
brains —they would probably do all
the better in life without them. This
was no doubt true enough, just as it
may be true that you can appreciate art
without being able to draw a straight
line; but if you happened to have any
brains, it was disconcerting. You felt
doomed to inevitable failure.
And the child who can draw, or who
wants to draw, as any potential artist
will want to, may well be disconcerted
when the blurb comes along and
frightens him about “the frustrations
of old-fashioned training and tech-
nique”; and when Bernard Smith
terrifies him about “fatal contacts with
the stereotyped attitudes imposed by
society”; and when Herbert Read says
he has to paint “icons” because (but
what have all the poets been doing?)
“Words cannot communicate our
irrational or super-rational moods”;
and when Joseph Burke warns him
that at about the age of twelve his
creative powers will “fall-off” and he
will start to imitate “the most common-
place and spurious models”; and when
Orban, a little muddled, says that there
is a “conflict” between creativeness and
imitation and fails to recognise that the
art of the cavemen, which he praises,
was, as well as creative, decidedly
■—indeed brilliantly—imitative.
The most interesting and significant
fact which emerges from these papers
is that, when he approaches adoles-
cence, the child does feel a need to
“imitate” the forms of the visible
world —which, of course, subject to
his infantile limitations, he has been
trying to do all along—and to force
him into a convention of avoiding
imitation would surely be just as frus-
trating as forcing him into the “con-
ventions about art and beauty” which
O. A. Oesser fears so much.
Basically, the problem discussed
applies to all the arts, and is as old as
any of them: do you kill all interest
in the subject by insistence on a rigid
technique; do you destroy all values by
having no technique; or do you sorqe-
how, in a disciplined freedom, try to
strike a balance?
And on the whole it is this balance
which the seminar advocates. Joseph
Burke says the teacher should not
“combat” the imitative tendencies of
adolescence “but rather harness them
to a sustained creative activity”; it is
only “up to the age of eight” that
Oesser thinks it “of Vital importance
not to instruct”; and Gordon Thomson,
along with Daryl Lindsay, thinks that
the child should see some great paint-
ings as well as “making marks and
playing around with paint”;—
The study of classical literature
did introduce to the child adult
material of the highest quality. There
is now a tendency, at least as far as
middle secondary level, to work only
with toys. We should see to it that
in art-appreciation, at any rate,
child is introduced to adult culture.
Otherwise, it would be possible for
a child to leave school at fifteen or
sixteen having met nothing that could
possibly interest an adult, except
some scraps of Shakspeare.
The conclusion seems to be that up
to the age of eight or maybe twelve,
you just let the child have fun, in all
sorts of ingenious ways, here described;
after that, at whatever peril to his soul,
you take him to the galleries and risk
a little instruction.
O'Neill in Love
Agnes Boulton, of
Part of a Long Story (Davies), was the
second wife of Eugene O’Neill,
although she didn’t know that until he
casually mentioned it some time after
their marriage, which lasted ten years
from 1918, and produced Shane, Oona
(Charles Chaplin’s wife), and his
earliest stage successes.
She had taken to writing for pulp-
magazines to keep her farm going, and
in 1917 she met O’Neill, a friend of
friends, in the back room of a New
York pub. He carried a bottle round
with him and helped himself to it
when he felt so disposed. His way of
life at that time was to write a short
play for the Provincetown players and
then hit the bottle. When he felt
another play coming on he would
begin to taper-off the bottle, and in
rooms at Provincetown would write
another play.

together in rooms in New York, mainly
for warmth. O’Neill reciting poems by
Richard Middleton at the drop of a
hat. Around this time he sent her
the typescript of “The Moon of the
Caribbees.” Then they are in rooms
at Provincetown, tapering-off and
working on “Beyond the Horizon”;
then back to New York; then back to
a flat at Provincetown, walking on the
sands and swimming and reading the
“Saturday Evening Post,” his favorite
relaxation, and coping with brother
Jamie, the actor. It only needed a visit
from Jamie and Eugene would go off
the water-wagon, and there was the
sad and frightening spectacle of this
nice girl coping with two brilliant
drunks, one a genius.
This book covers only the first two-
and-a-half years of the marriage. There
is a change of scene to a house of Mrs.
O’Neill’s own, from which she had
ousted her mother and father so that
O'Neill would be absolutely undis-
turbed; and then another change of
scene back to Provincetown and an old
Coastguard boathouse that had been
remade for them by Mabel Dodge into
what seems to have been a most
luxurious seaside home and author’s
workshop; and there is a meeting with
O’Neill’s mother and actor-father in
their hotel, at which brother Jamie
behaves badly again ...
From a literary point of view it
doesn’t comment much, but as a picture
of genius, both fallow and at work,
cursing and even hitting its patient
wife, taking an idea she had for a
story of her own and using it for a
play that never saw the light, moody,
despairing, charming, lost and found,
it is more absorbing than a novel, and
in some ways more profound than
anything that could be written about
O’Neill by a literary critic.

The Sons of Avrom: Roger Ikor
(Cape). Bokily tackling a complex
theme, this much-honored novel (Prix
Goncourt and Albert Schweitzer Prize)
describes how a family of Jews, driven
out of Russia by poverty and persecu-
don, settle in France and, over three
generations, survive the obstacles of
prejudice and history and gradually
become French Jews—a couple of
them more French than the French.
The idea is better than the execution,
however. Although the book is most
impressive where strands of French
history, economic and political, are
being woven into the story, the charac-
ters and the psychological effects of
history upon them are not so firmly
handled. But it leaves a deep impres-
sion of what it is like to be a Jew -in
Europe, and a strong, attractive flavor
of Jewish family life.

My Caravaggio Style: Doris Langley
Moore (Cassell). A London bookshop-
assistant decides to forge Byron’s
burnt memoirs, and, with the aid of his
mannequin-fiancee, studies the life of
Byron so that he may put together a
sufficient “fragment” in an exercise-
book with the paper watermarked 1816.
His fiancee, discovering his real pur-
pose, bums the forgery and goes off
with the indignant American book-
collector who unwittingly inspired the
attempt to deceive. Miss Moore writes
authoritatively about Byron and his
lost diary, and ingeniously introduces
