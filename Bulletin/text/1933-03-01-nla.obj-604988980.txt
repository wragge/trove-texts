That the Soundest State
IS
QUEENSLAND
EVERYONE AGREES
THAT
THE BRISBANE
“TELEGRAPH”
IS THE
Pre-eminent Sales
Medium
The Brisbane “Telegraph”
is renowned for its vigorous
influence, its freedom from
vulgarity and stupid sensa-
tionalism, and its high per-
centage of home deliveries.
The Brisbane “Telegraph”
carries more classified adver-
tisements than any other
Queensland daily.
It follows that advertisers
must agree that as an eco-
nomic force in the Queens-
land market “The Telegraph"
leads the way.

HIS
BOOKS
This Tangled World
Broadly the thinkers of the world whose
thoughts turn to material things have
divided themselves into two groups. One
says that it is absurd to expect even an
adequate financial and monetary system to
come through the Great War without
serious disturbance; that it will gradually
right itself; and that its success through the
hundred years of unexampled progress
prior to the Great War is the best reason
why we should not attempt to put in its
place something untried. The other says
its liability to a disturbance great enough
to produce the present World Depression
proves the system’s ineffectiveness; and
anyway, there were inherent defects which
would have produced a breakdown even
without a Great War. From this main
dividing-line there are innumerable off-
shoots; and they are all littered with books
and pamphlets.
Prices and Money
In Planned Money (Constable; Robert-
son and Mullens; 6s. 6d.) Sir Basil Blackett
a former Chancellor of the Exchequer ol
India and a present director of the Bank
of England, shows how even a man so
placed can be dissatisfied with things as
they are. His objective is a constant price
level. This he believes can be based on a
trade index-number, with a central bank
functioning to control the level. The aver-
age of wholesale prices for 1927-29 was 100;
and that might be taken as the index
figure. (Sir Basil is, however, careful to
point out that the figure should be that of
a normal period.) Actually, whereas the
average price-level in relation to that index
figure was 106 in 1926, in December, 1932,
it was below 65. The object of Planned
Money would be to prevent such violent
fluctuations. That, he argues, would do
away with booms and slumps. Yet there
might be a boom in one or more articles;
because it is only the general or average
level which it would be sought to control.
The author believes this level could be
controlled by central banks regulating the
supply of credit. But, granted that this
could be done—and there are plenty of
orthodox bankers who will agree that it is
possible—should it be done? Ought the
general price level to be kept stable in
view of constant improvements in produc-
tion? Should not prices generally move
down? Incidentally, though he adopts the
idea of a goods standard, Blackett does not
propose t6 entirely dethrone gold. It would
still be uised in international settlements.
The Douglas School
The Dbuglas Social Credit disciples, of
course, want planned money, too. The
outstanding difference between Blackett and
Douglas is that the latter, being an engineer,
reduces everything to a mathematical for-
mula, and has no doubts, whereas the
former, being merely a financial adminis-
trator of tremendous experience, is
“acutely conscious of the intricacies of the
-object ahd the experimental character of
the programme put forward.” Contrast
that with almost the last words in Major
Douglas’s The Monopoly of Credit (Chap-
man and Hall; 3s. 6d.)
Although it seems difficult to obtain gen-
,eral understanding of it, fundamentally a
system is a matter of pure arith-
metic, and the results which will be obtained
depend entirely upon the arithmetical factors
which are employed Whatever may be
the case in other matters, compromise in
arithmetic seems singularly out of place.
All of which is quite true, no doubt. But
it recalls an old rhyme about the sick gentle-
man who threw up a flock of crows. It
transpired that two mistakes had been
made. Thgre had not only been an error
m the arithmetic, but one also as to the
thing figured on—it was merely an object
black as a crow. So it is advisable always
to check more than the arithmetic of these
economists: they may mistake the thing
about which they do their figuring. Scores
of books and pamphlets have been written
to elucidate the Douglas theories; but,
generally, it is advisable for the student to
go straight to Douglas. The book herein
noticed covers most of the ground he takes.
Those who want a very short explanation
of the scheme, along with a criticism, might
turn to “The Douglas Credit Scheme,” by
W. K. McConnell, M.A., tutorial class lec-
turer in Economics, Sydney University
(Is.). A more comprehensive but much less
lucid criticism is contained in “Facts and
Fallacies of Douglas Credit,” by Professor
Copland. Dean of
the Faculty of
Commerce at Mel-
bourne (Melbourne
University Press;
Is.). Douglas’s
reply to Copland
is contained in “The New and the Old Eco-
nomics (Lothian; Is.). Those who want a
general outline of Douglas’s principles, issued
with the blessing of Douglas himself, might
turn to ‘ An Outline of Social Credit,” by
H. M. M. (Credit Research Library; 9d.);
and those who seek a simpler criticism than
Copland’s, and more detailed than McCon-
nell’s, might take “Tickets without Goods,”
by Lloyd Ross, tutor-organiser of the
W.E.A., University of Otago; 1/-. No one
group should be read without the other;
and above all things it ought to be kept
m mind that, though the sickness of a
patient may demand a remedy, the sickness
itself is no evidence whatever as to the
merits of any particular remedy offered.
Capitalism and Communism
In Capitalism and Communism: A
Reconciliation (Putnam), Oscar Newfang
inquires whether it is not possible to make
(1) such modifications of the capitalist
system as will give the workers full social
justice, full economic security through
minimising the cyclical fluctuations of
booms and depressions, and (2) such modifi-
cations of the Communist wage system as
will give the workers full economic freedom,
while still retaining the necessary labor
control. He warns his, readers against too
lightly thrusting Communism aside: he re-
calls that even John Stuart Mill, in his
of Political Economy,” wrote:
“We are too ignorant either of what indi-
vidual agency in its best form, or socialism
m its best form, can accomplish, to be
qualified to decide which of the two will be
the ultimate form of human society.”
The author tries to show how the objec-
tions • to the capitalist wage-system might
be overcome—by wage-fixation, by auto-
matic wage variations, by limitation
of dividends and otherwise: many of his
suggestions have been tried in Australia,
sometimes with painful reactions. Indeed,
Newfang himself seems to have a suspicion
that it might be easier to work from social-
ism down to his perfect State than from
individualism upward to it. At any rate,
he affirms that “Russian Communism has
already put into effect several of the modi-
fications of the Communist wage system
which tend to meet the objections of capi-
talism, and thus approach a common ground
on which a reconciliation of the two sys-
tems may be effected.”
A Job for the Individual
Of quite a different character is The
Alternative to Communism, by A. G Pape
and others (Cecil Palmer; 2s. 6d.). “We
believe,” says one of the others, “the un-
satisfactory social situation to be due far
less to defective institutions than to failings
in the individuals of which society is com-
posed, who somehow, through not under-
standing themselves, obstruct their own
and others’ happiness.” Most of the con-
tributors appear to have some connection
with the Theosophists; and their practical
suggestion is a world-wide New Political
Fellowship:—
By means of tools and machinery man has
achieved his conquest; but to-day he is
being challenged by the work of his own
hands. He himself has become little better
than a robot. He has lost control of his
machines because he has not learned self-
control ; and he has not mastered himself
because he has not learned to know himself.
Ihe laws of matter he has mastered by study-
ing and obeying them; the laws of his own
being are spiritual, and when they, too, are
understood and obeyed he will enter into his
heritage—of which he has lost the memory,
ft. al ! very misty; yet one may freely
admit that the hand is groping in the right
direction.

The Cosmopolitan Art
Every patriotic Australian would like to
see all-British films prevail over their rivals,
liut have they a chance? The “New
Statesman and Nation” didn’t say most
British films were poor because, as “E M T ”
suggested (B. 15/2/’33), it has “an interna-
tional complex,” but because it depends for
its existence on giving intelligent judgments
on art and literature. I have cuttings of
criticisms on similar lines from London
Observer Sunday Times,” “Morning
fJ i os l T? and the . current (January) issue of
the Review of Reviews.” (“A British film,
and as bad as only a British film can be ”
the last-named begins.)

dwellers complain that they never see the

British films reviewed—and impliedly
praised—in the Sydney press. The “S. M.
Herald” is the only Sydney daily that re-
views films; the others print publicity stuff.
It remarked in a recent notice of' “Black
Coffee”: “One has applauded whole-
heartedly the progress of British films”—
which was true as an abstract proposition.
But when the “S. M. Herald” discusses a
particular British film its applause is liable
to be fatally qualified. “Childish,” “tire-
some,” “static” and “stodgy” were some of
the terms applied to “Black Coffee.” Dis-
tressing truths were told about “The Maid
of the Mountains,” “The Mayor’s Nest,”
“Lucky Girl” (“A creaking concoction,
full of entirely conventional characters”),
“The Ringer” (“Blurred grey photo-
graphy”), and “Deadlock” (“The story, up
to a point, might have been taken from the
pages of a cheap novelette, and the acting
is appropriate to the plot”); and such
masterpieces of fatuity as “Double Dealing”
and “Love Lies” were ignored altogether.
No one is going to suggest that all British
films are hopeless; but most of them cer-
tainly are, and I submit that their badness
is implicit in their Britishism. Cinema is
the first essentially co-operative and inter-
national art that the world has known. Far
more so than ballet or even opera. The
films that have done most to make Holly-
wood a term of opprobrium have been
blatantly national. A few years ago the
magnates of the business in the U.S.A. got
dissatisfied, and began importing leading
European producers and players. Among
their finds was Mamoulian, who, according
to London “Clarion,” couldn’t make a living
in England; he “was not English enough.”
The Americans came to England when the
quota legislation passed, and began to make
pictures of English and European life. For
a number of reasons, one being that they
had previously snapped up some of the best
English actors, actresses and screen-writers,
their pictures were better than those made
by the British. But there was more in it
than clever acting and dialogue. A good
film must be highly objective. Modern
audiences resent any kind of propaganda.
Heroics about the Union Jack, which went
down well in the Edwardian era, and earlier,
irritate British and Australian film-addicts
nearly as much as emotional references to
Old Glory. Moral sentiments aren’t wel-
comed either. The old style of West End
comedy, musical and otherwise, which was
as English as Cheshire cheese, has been
superseded by sophisticated, fantastical stuff
like “Trouble in Paradise.” Such works of
art can’t be created by the nationals of any
one country. The ideal picture at the
moment from the standpoint of the English-
speaking races would probably have dia-
logue by an Englishman, an English or Con-
tinental setting, an English-American cast,
German and Russian technicians, a German
or Russian or French director (assisted by
authorities on the part of the world de-
picted), and it would be backed by Ameri-
can dollars—now selling at over 7s. in Aus-
tralia. How could any purely national film
stand up to such a combination?
J.B.D.
A School for the Australian Writer
Lieut.-Col. White, the new Customs
Minister, recently deplored the action of
“correspondents who have rushed breath-
lessly into print to wittingly or unwittingly
become the champions of what are, in the
main, indecent and pornographic books
that are fit reading only for degenerates.”
The Customs officers responsible for banning books
have as wide experience and less opportunity for
publicity than their critics. I have recently read a
parcel of books, including Aldous Huxley’s “Brave
New World,” which were banned last year at the
Customs, and I am satisfied in my own judgment
and without any prudery that the Customs officials,
with scrupulous integrity, are showing wise discrimi-
nation in a thankless task requiring broad knowledge
and literary taste.
We now know where we stand. We have
a censorship composed of wise and dis-
criminating men possessed of wide know-
ledge and literary taste. They know the
difference between art and pornography,
truth and indecency, sincerity and
obscenity, and so does their political head.
We ought to congratulate ourselves on this
remarkable condition of affairs because this
is the first time in the history of the world
that any country has been so blest. There
have been censorships since the year one
and earlier, and until the present time
they have invariably been wrong. When
Socrates walked the streets of Athens
“corrupting the youth” the. censors of the
period, with the hearty applause of the popu-
lace, applied a very effective gag. Rabelais
had a rough time from the censors of his
day. The Elizabethan Puritans regarded
Shakspeare as a writer of immoral plays.
Byron and Shelley shocked Victorians, and
Ibsen and Hardy were condemned as
obscene by later generations.
If the censors were subject to defective
understanding then, how is it that ours
are gifted with “wise discrimination” now?
I wish I knew, but I don’t. The censors
don’t help us. They just fall on a book,
call it indecent, obscene or pornographic;
and that is the end of it. They never say
what they mean by those words. And they
must know because they are wise and dis-
criminating men—Colonel White says so,
and he is so sure of the absolute value of his
opinion that he does not intend to discuss
the matter further with “correspondents
who rush breathlessly into print” in defence
of books “fit only for degenerates.”
The matter ought to be cleared up. “To
fhemists there is nothing unclean on earth,
And a writer has to be just as objective as
a chemist; he must renounce everyday sub-
jectivity and remember that njuck-heaps in
a landscape play a very respectable part,
.and that evil passions are as peculiar to
life as good ones.” So wrote Chekov, one
who suffered from people like Colonel
White in his day. “Fiction,” to quote
further, “is called artistic because it draws
life as it actually is. Its aim is absolute
and honest truth.” Chekov was a great
writer, and presumably our censors must
agree with him, since they are wise and
discriminating men. So they must know
better than the writers themselves whether
a work by Joyce or Lawrence is art or por-
nography, whether it is a truth about life
or a lie about life. If they know that it is
a lie about life they must know more about
life than Lawrence or Joyce. I would like
my son to be a great writer and know
as much about life as Shakspeare and
Chekov, so I mean to put him into the
department over which Colonel White pre-
sides.

A Satchel of Books
The Australian Educational Directory and
Gazette (Minerva Publishing Service, Syd-
ney ; 3s. 6d.) furnishes reliable information
about non-State schools. Also, it contains
relevant details of scholarships, the qualifi-
cations necessary to enter various profes-
sions, and much other useful information.
Hilarious Universe (Blackwell; 4s. 6d.)
is by Richard Dark, pictures by Thomas
Derrick. Don’t be put off by the news that
it is a kind of Girl Guide’s History of
Learning. It is very funny indeed, and from
behind his facade of fatuity the author deals
the pundits a number of damaging cracks.
The illustrations do a. let to assist the good
work.
Annette Ivellerman, who learnt to swim
in the Domain baths as a child, then toured
the world with her father, and is now a film
star, has been inspired by the Fairy Tale
films which she helped to make for Carl
Laemmle (Universal) to write Fairy Tales
of the South Seas (Sampson Low; 3s. 6d.).
They are interesting, even exciting, yarns,
with a special appeal to Australian and
Maoriland youngsters. A couple of dozen
full-page illustrations by Marcelle Wooster
add to the attractiveness of the big book.
Pat Sayle. the eminent sculptor, and his
wife were giving a party at their Hammer-
smith house when a taxi arrived with the
severed head of a film star on the back
seat. Such is the macabre opening of
Death of a Star, by G. D. H. and M. Cole
(The Crime Club; 7s. 6d.). The late owner
of the head was the kind of woman any-
body might have murdered, and a member
of the Sayles’ party owned up to having
lived with her, so the police had ample scope
for investigation. Not a very thrilling
thriller, but the pictures of London life are
interesting.
Man Proposes, by Doran Hill (Sampson
Low: Robertson and Mullens; 7s. 6d.).
Peter Drave, as a youngster in a London
office, is turned down by a lovely typist in
favor of the book-keeper. It embitters him.
He leaves, becomes an estate agent, makes
money. Comes the depression. He is poor
again, but Susan loves him and he loves her,
so all is well. Sentimental as an early-
Victorian drawing-room ballad, yet the char-
acterisation is shrewd.
The Granites boom started towards the
end of last year. The area had been con-
demned for big gold by a competent investi-
gator as far back as 1900, so Associated
Newspapers and Melbourne “Herald and
Weekly Times” sent a joint expedition to
report on the prospects, if any. F. E.
Baume’s Tragedy Track (Frank C. Johnson;
65.) describes the party’s adventures. Apart
from its interest as a dramatic story, the
book contains much bush wisdom.
The difference between the treatment of the natives
by new chums out here and the few old prospectors
left is apparent. When “Joe the Nark” or Jack
Dempsey or O’Leary or Simon Rieff tells a native
to do anything he does it quickly. There is some-
thing in the tone which demands action and there
is no conversation apart from the order... . But the
new chum smiles at the black and “yabbers” with
him. The black giggles and becomes contemptuous.
The Madigan Report and a financial his-
tory of the boom are appended. The photo-
graphs are excellent.
And a Little Verse
TIDES.
Beyond the sparkling bar, withdrawn, apart,
The breakers shout;
But there’s a tide of winter in my heart
Has not gone out.
Has not, howe’er the sunlight steeps in gold
The sands of snow,
Receded so that one might glimpse the cold
Black reefs below.
And so this summer hour, complete and
whole,
Must pass me by,
Because the tide of winter in my soul
Still runs so high.

TO A DILETTANTE.
Love while ’tis yet love’s season,
Kiss while a kiss is sweet;
After love’s rhyme comes Reason,
Tripping the tardy feet.
Gold in Illusion’s glass is
Wine of the morning star.
Fool, ere the fierce gleam passes.
Drink to the things that are!
Flame that is Eldorado,
Mist that is far Cathay,
And the little bells of shadow
That ring at the end of the day!
Laugh and drink deep. Fate scorning,
Fearless of what betide
Over beyond the morning,
When but these things abide.
Ash that was Eldorado,
Dust that was once dream-pearled,
And the'-little fire of shadow
That burns at the end of the world.

WESTRALIA UNDER
FEDERATION.
The noisy little band of disruptionists in
Perth are trying to persuade the people of
Westralia that they are the victims of a
t’otherside conspiracy which has bled the
State white and spragged the wheels of
its industry. “Secession,” they shriek,
“means release from the clutching hand,
the bondage, the chains and the shackles.
It means salvation from the present depres-
sion. It will bring prosperity to our primary
producers; our ports will flourish and our
factories will have great oportunities; it
will provide work for everybody.” Is
Westralia really in the condition thus pic-
tured? Has it been robbed of its oppor-
tunities, so that it has lagged behind the
other States? What is its history under the
Federation which is alleged to have used
the clutching hand against it and put it in
bondage and loaded it with chains?
Westralia was not always federated; until
1901 it knew nothing of clutching hands or
bondage or chains. Between 1860 and 1890,
before the influence of gold was felt—a
period when the State had all the oppor-
tunities which the disruptionists demand
for it—its net immigration totalled 17,554.
Actually in tjvo of these six five-year periods
there was an absolute loss of population by
excess of emigration. In the next 15 years
there was a large increase; we may well
rule it out as having no bearing upon Fed-
eration one way or the other. But after
1905 normal conditions prevailed; and the
effects of Federation can be fairly well
gauged. At, that time Victoria was indus-
trially the most highly developed State and
the best placed to take advantage of inter-
state freetrade. This table shows how the
two have compared:—
Annual Rate of Population Increase, Per Cent.
Victoria. Commonwealth. Westralia.
1906-11 ... 2.17 .. 2.03 .. 2.43
1911-16 ... 1.38 .. 1.95 .. 1.76
1916-21 ... 1.68 .. 1.99 .. 1.27
1921-26 2.00 .. 2.09 .. 2.44
1930 0.77 . . 0.96 . . 0.92
In the growth-of-population figures, then,
it is impossible to find any evidence that
Westralia has been in shackles.
And when we search for the clutching
hand in the banking figures we shall find
ourselves drawing another blank. Westralia
had a savings bank in 1864; under that
complete liberty which the disruptionists
now seek, it had in 35 years been able to
gather deposits of .£7 2s. Id. per head of
population. And that, let it be observed,
was 10 years after the goldfields had been
established. In 1929 (it may not be fair,
because of abnormal conditions, to go past
that date) Westralia had £29 3s'. lid. per
head on deposit in the savings banks—
four times more than it had gathered
in all the years of its glorious freedom"!
Perth disruptionists are particularly fond of
describing how their State has been robbed
to fatten Queensland. Between 1925 and
1929 the average deposits per head of
Queensland population did not increase one
penny. The increase in Westralia was
£4 ss. 9d. The increase for all Australia
was no more than £3 os. 9d.
The clutching hand seems to have mis-
fired also in the matter of bank advances.
Instead of Westralian deposits in joint-stock
banks being grabbed for use in other States,
the advances in Westralia are almost double
the deposits. A little comparison here may
be enlightening:—
Percentage of Advances on Deposits (1930).
Westralia . . 192.96 p.c. | Queensland .. 94.37 p.c.
S. Australia 110.42 „ I Victoria .. 89.80 „
N. S. Wales 100.40 „ | Tasmania .. 71.95 „
The Eastern States, which are accused of
grabbing everything and leaving nothing
for Westralia, have in fact advanced that
State not only all its own deposits
(£10,371,000), but £9,641,000 besides.
It is a subject of the bitterest complaint
that Westralian secondary industries have
been crushed at their birth by eastern com-
petition. Now, here again Westralia had
plenty of time before Federation arrived to
get on its feet industrially; yet in all the
years up to 1899 it had accumulated no
more than 9407 factory employees. In 1929
it had 20,804; the 30 years of oppression
had more than doubled the number it had
acquired in all the happy years of freedom.
And there was no reason why it should not
have done a great deal better. Its basic
wage was well below that of the bigger
industrial States. The next comparison
shows at the end of 1929 the average
weekly wage rate for an adult male:—
Average Weekly Wage for Male (1929).
N. S. Wales. . 102 s. lid. | Westralia .. 100 s. 7d.
(Queensland .. 101 s. 2d. |S. Australia .. 975. 2d.
Victoria .. 101 s. Id. | Tasmania .. 945. Bd.
The cost of living (including housing) was
much lower in Perth than in the big indus-
trial cities. The end-of-1929 index figures
were: Sydney 1897, Melbourne 1795, Adel-
aide 1740, Perth 1721. If Westralia was not
providing its own factory goods, there was
nothing, then, in cost-of-living figures to
explain it; the explanation must be found
in something else.
And we m*iy be able to discover some-
thing to suggest an explanation in certain
other figures. The increase of area under
wheat in Westralia has been splendid. In all
the years before Westralia was in the bonds,
it managed to get 84,516 acres under culti-
vation; those are the figures for 1899. In
1930 the area under wheat was 3,958,313
acres. But compare these figures of aver-
age yield in bushels of the wheat-growing
States:—
1890-99. 1900-10. 1920-30.
N. S. Wales . . 9.95 11.00 12.43
Victoria . . . . 8.07 10.36 13.29
S. Australia . . 4.69 9.21 10.72
Westralia .. .. 10.95 10.91 10.89
These are the official figures—from Cogh-
lan’s “Seven Colonies” for the earliest
period; from the “Official Year Book” for
the later periods. In every State except
Westralia there has been a steady improve-
ment in average yield; in Westralia there
has been a steady falling-away. It is no
answer that Westralia has been adding
very rapidly to its area under crop.
Others have added more rapidly; the
increases (in acres) during the five years
1925-30 were:—
NT. S. Wales.. 2,199,000 I Westralia .. 1,846,000
Victoria .. 2,087,000 J S. Australia.. 1,715,000
Or turn to dairying—and here Westralia
has very definite advantages in the export
trade. Yet in 1930 it still had only 67,592
milking cows as against N.S.W.’s 858,194,
Queensland’s 643,272 and Victoria’s 617,254.
However, it can be said that, under Feder-
ation, the figures show an improvement.
A suggestion of what Westralia was like in
the days before the clutching hand fell
upon it is given by this comparison of the
average yield per cow:—

In the happy days of Westralia’s liberty
its people were apparently content if
Strawberry gave a little more than one-
third as much milk as Victoria to-day re-
quires of its Strawberry. But though it
has awakened to some extent here, other
of its figures are still distressing. No part of
Australia is better adapted for pig-raising;
yet positively Westralia to-day does not
grow enough bacon and hams for its own
consumption. It had 61,052 pigs in 1901;
it had only 49,243 in 1928, though there
has been a small increase since.
In some respects Westralia has made
amazing progress. What it has done in
metallurgy is as good as any country any-
where and at any time has done. But it
is plain that the same cannot be said for
all its efforts. It knows it should have
done better, and it blames Federation for
it. Federation has its disabilities, and
they should be removed; but The Bulle-
tin suggests that the figures quoted arid
many others which might be quoted show
that Westralia itself has not risen to its
opportunities; and, whether they live within
its boundaries or outside of them, those
people are its enemies who would tiy to
hide that fact and send it off on false
trails.
STILL MORE DOUGLAS DISCREDIT.
The Australian Economic Advisory Coun-
cil has issued a statement declaring that the
Douglas Credit system is “mostly non-
sense” and giving briefly the reasons why
it thinks so. Unfortunately the system is
so well organised that answers of one kind
or another have been prepared to meet
almost every possible objection; and that
is why this discussion is apparently inter-
minable. Of a hundred or more letters of
interrogation or exposition half a dozen
seem to call most clearly for notice.
Q- —I agree that “trade is a system of
barter, and all the world needs is enough
counters to carry on this barter smoothly .”
As this barter is not being carried on
smoothly, obviously there are not enough
counters. It is the function of Government
to provide these counters in sufficient quan-
tity, and Douglas shows how it can be done
scientifically by equation of purchasing
power with prices. Have you, or any other
critic of Douglas, provided a solution which
will overcome the inherent fault in finance
disclosed by the A + B theorem? —E. V. S.
(Sydney).
A.—But no inherent fault has been dis-
closed. The world has just witnessed its
most colossal war, tens of millions of men
being kept out of production and set to
work to destroy what other tens of mil-
lions produced, and the cost was paid for by
larger borrowings than the mind of man had
ever before conceived. Of course the sys-
tem was violently disturbed. That barter
is not being, carried on smoothly does not
prove that there are not enough counters
any more than dislocation of truflic after a
landslide proves that there are not enough
freight trucks.
Q. — The Bulletin has been putting the
boot into the Douglas plan. But will it
deny that there is something wrong until
our economic system? Will it assert that
there is no vast store of unpurchased goods,
and if they are not unpurchased because of
the lack of purchasing power what in
thunder can it be for? — C. E. E. (S.A).
A. — The Bulletin doesn’t deny that
goods are un purchased because of lack of
purchasing power. But that doesn’t prove
that Douglas's explanation of the cause of
the shortage is right. Suppose there is
an island with 50 people on it. They get
all they produce. If they planned their
operations, they would do very well, satis-
fying all their needs. But if 25 of them
decided to grow cucumbers and nothing else,
there would soon be an enormous glut of
cucumbers; and, since the growers could
not sell them, they would have no purchas-
ing power, and this failure of purchasing
power would seriously affect the prosperity
of the others. So we see shortage of pur-
chasing power does not necessarily arise
from anything bad in our monetary system;
it may be due simply to maladjustment of
industrial forces.
Q. —Perhaps The Bulletin could ex-
plain the reason why the following simple
A + B theorem shoves a shortage of purchas-
ing power. Take a chain or series production
of shoes. The grazier sells bullocks to the
meatworks for £5O. They pay £5O in wages
and sell to the tanner for £lOO. The tanner
pays £5O in wages and sells to the currier
for £l5O. The currier pays £5O in wages.
The shoe factory buys for £2OO and pays
£5O in wages. We now have shoes costing
£250. But only £2OO has been paid in wages;
and £2OO cannot buy £25O.—M. J. K. (S.A.).
A.—No, it can’t. But the man who sold
the bullocks got £5O; and whether you like
to call it an A payment or a B payment
or a Z payment it was money, and it was
just as much purchasing power as any of
the wages.
Q. —■'You ask why the money system didn’t
break down long ago. The objective of the
proposals of Douglas is the distribution of
the glut of goods which have been brought
into being by the achievements of science
during the past half-century. Several palli-
atives have enabled the existing financial
system to carry on, although imperfectly.
These are: —
(1) Bankruptcies and company liquidations. Goods
are then sold below their financial cost.
(2) Writing down of capital
(3) Exporting—the dumping on to other countries
of goods iqhich members of the exporting com-
munity ara unable to purchase for themselves. This
struggle for markets leads to international friction
and often to palliative No. h.
(h) Wars —one of the quickest methods of using
up goods. These have been frequent since the time
of George 111. Finance at such a time is always
available without stint.
(5) Production of capital goods (e.g., roads,
bridges, railways, factories, machinery, etc.). This
is partly responsible for the building up, in Aus-
tralia, of the national debt. In 1860 this debt was
£12,000,000 and by 1930 it had increased to
£1,115,000,000.
A.—First, we shall rule out nine-tenths
of all these loans, because, as we have said
before, they are contracted not to buy things
that have been made, but to g,et things made ;
in other words, they have had nothing to do
with any shortage of purchasing power. It
is interesting, however, to read that Douglas
proposes to put something in place of the
discharge in bankruptcy. That really is what
Douglas’s social credit amounts to; and if
his A + B theorem is correct, the same
result could be produced by allowing every
trader to file his schedule every (say) seven
years. During that period he could sell at
below cost and keep his shelves cleared ; by
the end of the term he would, of course, have
a fine lot of liabilities, of which the Court
would relieve him. The Major simply pro-
poses to get in first and give discharges in
bankruptcy in advance. If the Douglas
system is right, then the greater the num-
ber of bankruptcies, the better off a com-
munity ought to be.
Q. —You say that if the A B theorem
is sound , then always thei'c must have been
unpurchasable goods , and you ask where
those are that were produced in the reign
of George 111. Douglas shows that there
are various ways in which such goods are
got rid of —by liquidations, forced sales and
tears; and, among others, these: —
Whilst gold was money, the occasional discovery
of gold in California, Australia and South Africa
provided new money and temporarily helped to
bridge the ever-present gap between Total Prices
and Total Money purchasing power. (Goldfinding is.
the only work that makes money, and no goods.
All other work makes goods, and not money.)
Natural deterioration , wastage and destruction by
fire of perishable and other goods. (At the present
day mountains of produce remain unsold or are
destroyed; viz., in U.S.A., 1932, two million bales
of cotton were to be held out of the market, and three
million bags of wheat.) Also actual destruction of
cotton, calves, wheat, rubber, coffee, pearls, sheep-
skins, fish, fruit, etc.
The seat of the economic error is the ever-
widening gap between total prices of the
output and the financial ability of the people
to buy the product. —Edgar Plumpton
(Vic.).
A.—The more gold you produce, the higher
commodity prices climb; so if there is a gap
you don’t bridge it by producing gold. Nor
will you bridge it by issuing credit notes
to take the place of gold. Douglas says
there isn’t enough purchasing power to buy
everything produced. Therefore he proposes
that a national bank shall issue consumer
notes to make up the balance. But who
pays the bank? Apparently nobody. It
just goes on “issuing credits,” as they call
it —that is to say, printing notes. What be-
comes of them? It is no good a bank or
any other authority issuing a note to a
bootmaker in part payment for a pair of
shoes unless he can buy bread with it; and
it is no good to the baker unless he can buy
vegetables with it; and so on. Once those
notes are issued they are issued ; and when
the 500,000,000 th is floating around, it seems
very likely that they will be a bit of a
nuisance.
And so The Bulletin says that even if the
Douglas diagnosis of the world’s trouble
was right—and it isn’t—the treatment would
be all' wrong: as wrong as giving a dipso-
maniac suffering from shock the free run of
a distillery. .
COMMUNISM AND A SECOND
CHAMBER.
After the Sydney metropolitan A.L.P.’s
acceptance of whole-hog Communism there
should be no doubt about the result of
the Second Chamber referendum in N. S.
Wales. We know what the policy of the
Communist party is; it despises majority
rule and is prepared to use any trick that
will give the minority—meaning itself—the
control which it cannot otherwise secure.
That is how it contrived in Russia, though
less than half a million strong, to capture
complete authority over a country of 150
millions. Parliament is its bugbear. Parlia-
ment represents or is supposed to represent
the people; and the people are a “dull,
amorphous mass*’ who stand in the way of
the gospel as it was preached by Marx
and Lenin. Therefore Parliaments must be
made as innocuous as can be, capable of
offering the least possible resistance. For
that reason one House is to be greatly pre-
ferred to two; two Houses may offer
much more than twice the resistance, of one,
because it is almost certain that the Second
Chamber will be specially designed to with-
stand white-anting and other well-known
Communist methods of attack.
There still remains among Democrats
and Radicals a hazy objection to a Second
Chamber. Their grandfathers and in some
cases their fathers stood firm for a single
Chamber. There was a very good reason
for it, too. The only Second Chambers
they knew were either created for the
special protection of Property or were
hereditary, and as such the natural cham-
pions of vested interests. The modern
Second Chamber has not one single feature
in common with these. It is as “broad-
based upon the people’s will” as any First
Chamber. Its one purpose in a State is to
safeguard the rights of the people. There
are forces in this world prepared to take
away those rights, it may be in order to
impose upon the people a form of govern-
ment approved only by a minority, it may
be merely in order to line the pockets of
financial adventurers. A Second Chamber
will make it difficult for any such attack
to succeed. There is no question of stand-
ing in the way of the people. The Chamber
which N. S. Wales will have if the people
say Yes will have no power even to stop
the people from doing wrong if they insist
upon it. All it will have the power to do
will be to stop the Lower House from im-
posing upon the people something which it
believes the people do not want. But it
can delay it only long enough to allow the
people to be consulted; if they say Yes,
then the measure goes through.
Let us realise at once, then, that, this is
not a question of Communism or capital-
ism. If N. S. Wales wants Communism, the
new Leg. Council will have no power what-
ever to deny it Communism. But it will
have power to stand in the way of Com-
munism until the people say they want it.
Communists who are not revolutionists, who
want to do everything constitutionally,
should therefore vote Yes. Only those
who want to leave the way open for
sneaking Communism in behind the backs
of the people should vote No.
THE AIRPLANE IN WAR.
I had come into Manchuria for the pur-
pose of bringing m.edical relief to the
Chinese immigrants afflicted with the plague,
and ran into a big story. For you will
agree that the transporting of an army’s
wounded to base hospitals hundreds of
miles away is a big and important story.
It is not hard to be convinced that war
is going ori here in Manchuria. Sandbag
redoubts at every station, Japanese sentries
with sharpened bayonets at every bridge—
these are ominous reminders, It keeps the
old brain-cells pretty much alert to follow
what is really happening; and it taxes
one’s ingenuity to get to where the history-
making events are actually taking place.
For instance, down in Mukden the other
day it seemed as if the seat of war had
been picked up bodily and carried by run-
ners in seven-league boots to Shanghai.
All the war correspondents except one char-
tered Moth ’planes and flew southward,
like a swarm of fireflies drawn to a tungsten
lamp. And here is where the story of
Patriot 11. comes in. Patriot 11. is an air-
plane bought with the pennies of the people
of Japan and presented to the army to use
in caring for wounded soldiers.
During a lull in the campaign, when we
thought conditions w 7 ere normal again, I
had started northward with medicines,
microscopes and Manchu porters in a
freight car pulled by a wheezy old engine
driven by a bandit-scared Chinese driver.
When I arrived at Taolaichao in a grey
dawn three days later, I discovered that war,
like a temperamental wind, had changed
its direction and overtaken me. The
station platforms were crowded with
soldiers, equipped with service kits, de-
training and hustling into formation. The
sidings were choked with troop trains. A
slant-eyed staff officer commandeered mv
train. My Manchus, medicines and micro-
scopes were dumped into trucks loaded
with machine-guns and rice. Other things
joined in. The whistles of officers. The
.zooming of airplanes. The banzais of
soldiers. The shouted orders through loud
speakers in the lighted windows of army
headquarters set up in the second-storey
station offices. I was in the midst of the
real thing and I had barged .in upon it by
blind chance.
Presently I worked my way across to the
station hotel. There word came in that


General Hasebe was intent upon pushing on
to Harbin. Uprooted rails and burned
bridges had cut him off from his forces
ahead. The division under command of
General Tamon was at Shwangchen in dire
need of reinforcements. The situation was
perilous for the Japanese. And the way by
, rail was blocked. A heavy snow, which had
developed into a blizzard, was storming
over the country.
Hasebe mobilised every airplane, military
and private, in Southern Manchuria, and
managed to have most of them on the spot
that day. The following morning we
watched the air fleet, composed of
machines of all ages and types, zoom up
into the snow-filtered air to transport
Hasebe’s brigade to the relief of Tamon.
My chief interest was not war, however,
but what went on after the fight. I had
come there to wage a battle not against
man but against disease. And now, while
the turmoil of war prevented me temporar-
ily from carrying on with my job, I res-
cued my precious property from the trucks
and stood by ready to use it io giving first-
aid when the wounded were brought in
after the battle. The hotel was turned into
a hospital and, as far as the Taolaichao
emergency was concerned, the situation was
well in hand.
The more serious problem lay ahead.
According to Surgeon-General Inabe, in
charge of military hospitals back of the
fighting lines, the task of conveying the
seriously wounded from Shwangchen and
points closer to Harbin seemed insurmount-
able. Battle was raging at Shwangchen,
The rails that had been repaired were de-
stroyed again by the enemy that was clos-
ing in behind the Japanese. One hospital
train had been obliged to go back. Then
someone thought of Patriot 11., and Surgeon
Inabe decided that it could be put to no
better service than transporting the
wounded from the battlefront to the hos-
pital at Changchun. Orders were issued
at once by General Hasebe for laying out
a landing-place at Shwangchen, and a mes-
sage was sent to Mukden for Patriot 11. to
fly north. Squads cleared the snow from
a piece of land near where the wounded
were being temporarily cared for, and made
a safe landing-place. In less than 12 hours
the Patriot arrived and was ready to begin
its ambulance service. Another blizzard
prevented action the first day, but next
morning air transmission of wounded sol-
diers began.
The day following I had the opportun-
ity of taking off and visiting the battle-
front by ambulance ’plane. The experience
has been a revelation to me. First it has
taught me much concerning the efficiency
of the Japanese Medical Corps. Then I
was astonished to discover the tenderness
with which this Oriental race looks after
the wounded, whether friend or enemy: so
far as I could see, it made no difference to
these people what side a soldier fought on;
when a man is wounded he ceases to be
an enemy. In the four journeys I made in
that hospital ’plane, the tragic cost of war,
too, was impressed upon my mind. These are
reckoning days in Manchuria between the
Japanese and the Chinese; and the bills
are paid in human currency. To-day we
brought back 20 men and the Changchun
hospital is being rapidly filled with the
wounded that can once again be transported
by train. During my flights I saw, in the
great white panorama beneath me, about
the stations at Taolaichao and Shwangchen,
and onward to the environs of Harbin,
countless bodies sprawled on the snow.
Nature had spread a spotless sheet for the
dead: but from the air they resembled
logs that woodcutters had left scattered in
the open until they had time to gather
them in.
A Japanese doctor who was present at
the battle of Shwangchen told me about it.
In the semi-darkness of early morning, the
anti-Kirin forces launched the offensive.
Under the protection of machine-guns they
started a bayonet charge on the Japanese.
Hasebe responded with a bombardment,
using trench mortars. The shells, explod-
ing in the midst of the charging Chinese,
caused many casualties, and the enemy took
to cover behind the wall of a large com-
pound in which was an orchard and truck
garden. By a flank movement, Hasebe
attempted an attack from the rear. But
reinforcements for the Chinese sWarmed
over the hills in such numbers that
Hasebe’s troops were almost swamped. The
General spurred his men on. The fighting
became hand-to-hand. Despite the deter-
mination of the Japanese, it developed into
a losing battle. Suddenly several ’planes
appeared overhead and began bombing the
Chinese reinforcements. Airplanes in the
hands of an army opposing another army
without them—they are hell! The Chinese
fied pell-mell to near-by villages. The
orchard had become a shambles, soaked
with blood.
From the sky descended the drone of
approaching ’planes. It filled the men be-
low with a conflict of emotions. To the
Chinese, the roar stood for bombs and
frightful death. To the Japanese, it sang
a song of comfort.
One by one, Japanese and Chinese, these
innocent victims of a war beyond their
own making, were carried from the bloody
field and deposited in the ’planes that
would wing them to a spot where war, with
all its hates and pains, could hot reach.
Steel birds, bom in the brains of men,
spreading their strong wings in a flight of
mercy.

The Grievances of the Little Sisters.
From almost the first moment the subject
was discussed, it was felt that Federation,
by bringing in freetrade among the States,
might do an injustice to the industrially-
backward ones. The Constitution there-
fore provided, first, that Westralia might
keep its own tariff for five years, collect-
ing duties on imports from other States,
and, second, that the Commonwealth
might “grant financial assistance to any
State on such terms and conditions as the
Parliament thinks fit.” No basis was, laid
down for determining the circumstances
under which assistance should be given, nor
was any rule for measuring the assistance
offered.
Tasmania, which had an uneasy feeling
that it would suffer most, put forward
various proposals. One of them, the so-
called Braddon Blot, was adopted; another,
submitted by the Speck’s Statistician, was
pushed aside as too inelastic. This latter
suggestion was, in effect, that any surplus
should be distributed in proportion to the
losses sustained by the States respectively
from the abolition of local Customs and
excise. It may be that the Federal Con-
vention saw no need to go into details in
this matter, inasmuch as it had provided for
an inter-State Commission “with such
powers of adjudication and administration
as the Parliament deems necessary for the
execution and maintenance.... of the pro-
visions of this Constitution relating to trade
and commerce.” But unfortunately the
High -Court at the very outset destroyed
the power of what had been expected to
be “the eyes and ears of Parliament,” and
the mariner of determining what assistance,
if any, should be given to necessitous
States was left high and dry.
The ordinary payments made by the
Commonwealth to the States were very
substantial, and no serious movements for
special grants took place prior to 1920.
In the previous year (1918-19) the subsidy
of 25/- per capita, with a special concession
to Westralia —this was under the Common-
wealth Surplus Revenue Act of 1910 —
amounted to £6,364,333; including a grant
of £90,000 to Tasmania, it amounted to
11.08 p.c. of the entire revenue of the
States. From various causes into which it
is not at the moment necessary to inquire,
the smaller States began soon after this to
make urgent demands upon the Common-
wealth. In 1923-24 the special payments to
Tasmania and Westralia combined were
£200,000. In 1926 Parliament approved of
a special grant of £300,000 a year for five
years to Westralia. In 1928 S. Australia
asked for a special grant of £750,000, and in
the following year a Coriimission recom-
mended that it should have £500,000 a year
for two years—Parliament made it
£1,000,000 spread over three years. Before
the three years had expired S. Australia
appealed for special assistance, and
£850,000 was provided. In 1930 the same State
asked for £1,950,000; the Public Accounts
Committee recommended, and Parliament
agreed to grant, £1,000,000. Meantime West-
ralia had been making urgent calls. In 1931
it asked for £450.000; the old £300,000 a
year was continued. It followed that with
a plea for a million a year indefinitely;
£500,000 was provided. In four years S.
Australia has had £3,530,000; in six years
Westralia has had £2,000,000 and Tasmania
£l,67B,ooo—assuming that the amounts pro-
vided for the current year are paid. Mean-
time, of course, the regular subsidies have
been continued to all the States: the total
subsidies and grants in 1929-30, before the
extra-special drafts were made, totalled
£8,494,912, or £1 6s. 6d. per head of popula-
tion.
The whole position is unsatisfactory.
There is no authority charged with the
investigation of these claims, and conse-
quently no common formula is applied for
determining what assistance, if any, should
be granted. The result is that the State
which can do the most harm to a Govern-
ment, and shows that it is ready to do it,
is liable to extract the most. It is utterly
wrong that this species of bushranging
should be encouraged; and it can best be
discouraged by setting up an authority to
regularise the whole business.

The Grazier and His Debts.
During the past fortnight The Bulletin
has had abundant evidence that the cities
do not realise the depth of the bog in
which the rural industries are floundering.
A grazier. “Dialectica,” stated his position
(B. 8/2/’33); and many
ordinarily well-informed city men—have
written to say that it was not possible for
a man to borrow so much on the security
named. The Bulletin has made careful
inquiry, and has proof not only that the
financial position of “Dialectica” is worse
than he said it was, but that many others
are in as bad a position. He owes over
£lO,OOO on a property whichithis year—a
very fair one —grossed £630; his expenses
were about £7OO. and he declares that the
real value of the property is probably not
more than about £3OOO. “It is obvious,”
he said, “that the writing down on a grand
scale of mortgages on sheep and wheat
properties must soon be done.”
An ex-banker of great experience puts the
mortgagee’s side:—
“Dialectica” is hopelessly involved and
overweighted, and must know it. “Actually
I am bankrupt,” lie says. He certainly is,
and has been ever since the execution of
the contract to buy. He humorously
inquires, in the event of bis going off the
place, “who the dickens would be fool
enough to want to pay him [the vendor]
the £lO,OOO I have contracted to pay?”
“Dialectica” appears to be under the im-
pression that this is the only alternative,
quite regardless of the natural desire ot
the vendor to repossess his property and
get the -return from it of which the Mora-
torium Act is at present robbing him.
“Dialectica’s” loathing at “handing over 80
per cent, of my produce to a mortgagee
I have never even seen, and who does not
labor on the place, or take any risk of sheep
deals,” calls to mind an occasion when' 1
was interviewed by an applicant seeking
assistance to acquire a large station prop-
erty. Having been furnished with details
of country, rentals, improvements, stock,
etc., an estimate of their value, and the
purchase price asked, I inquired what pro-
portion of the amount he wished to borrow.
He replied that he had nothing to put up,
adding, “You will have full security in the
property to bo purchased.” I was aston-
ished at his moderation, and recommended
his negotiating elsewhere to acquire half
of the city on the same lines.
In a national situation like this how far
can men be permitted, or how far should
they be encouraged, to stand on their
legal rights? It is a difficult question.
“The public good is the highest law,” no
doubt; but what is the public good? In
favor of the mortgagor one fact stands out
conspicuously. Because of the increase
in the purchasing power of money, the
farmer may have to produce twice as
much wheat or wool to pay a debt as
when the debt was incurred, while any
money which the mortgagee might receive
would be worth twice as much as when the
money was advanced. There is good
ground, therefore, for readjustment of these
liabilities if the public interest lies in that
direction. And there is no question that
it does: first, because it is highly inadvis-
able that a large number of competent men
should be put off the land and replaced by
men less competent; second, because while
the position remains unadjusted the assets
are neglected and pests flourish.
And there is a further danger. Another
trustworthy grazier-correspondent puts it: —
One unpleasant feature of the times is
the spread of forces of resistance in the
shape of Farmers’ Protection Leagues. If
anything in the nature of a wholesale selling
up of properties is ever attempted, lawless
resistance will break out like a bushfire,
and when and where it will burn out God
knows.
These men believe they have an equity:
they might not seriously object if bad
seasons drove them out. What they do
object to is being, as they allege, robbed of
their equity by a fall in prices due to a
worid-carascrophe. Such a catastrophe,
they hold, calls for Government action on
their behalf.
Among the multitude of suggestions for
concerted action, one crops up repeatedly
in various forms. As put by a country cor-
respondent :
Working expenses (rates, taxes, wages,
repairs, freight, etc.) plus interest now
absorb all the income from a grazing
property. (In “Dialectica’s” case a little
more, others a little less.) Very well; pay
all the working expenses, and what is over
divide between the mortgagee and the nomi-
nal owner. The latter would have some in-
centive to work, and the former would not
lose half his capital, and would get back
a larger income as prices improve. At
present he collects (when he can) 5 or (5 per
cent., and the man who does the work gets
nothing. If the latter throws np the game
in disgust, the mortgagee must employ
labor to work his newly-acquired property,
which will leave him with a smaller income
than the half-share 1 suggest.
A variant of this is that interest should
be paid, but treated as a reduction of
capital debt—it is recalled that in 49 b.c.
Julius Caesar, faced with a fierce economic
crisis, prescribed this among other medi-
cines.

Getting Rid of Responsibility.
A typical story comes to this office from
a country town —and not- very much in the
country, either. A little chap of six or
seven was hammering nails in a board, and
propped it against a shelf in the living-
room while he hammered. On the shelf
was a loaded rifle. It slipped, fell and struck
a chair, and the child got the bullet in his
back. The eldest of the children said,
“Daddy always leaves the rifle there, and
it has never gone off before.” “Daddy
always leaves the rifle there”—and nobody
doubts that daddy is devoted to his family.
What is at the back of it all? Perhaps
as a people we are casual about most
things. We are told that this is character-
istic of the pioneer. But that is very
doubtful. The pioneer, as a rule, has to be
careful about most things. The whole re-
sponsibility is on him: if he falls into
trouble he must find his own way out of
it—which is a very good school for teach-
ing a man to be careful not to fall into
it. Could there be anything more unlike
that than the atmosphere in which we live
who are no longer pioneers?
And we are drifting further and further
in that direction. We are now even ex-
pecting the State to bring up our children
for us. In all the recent discussions about
education one thing has been hardly men-
tioned—the responsibility of the parent.
It is to the teacher and the school that we
are encouraged to turn, not only for the
instruction of the child, but actually for
the formation of character. Surely we
are going too far that way. Surely the
time has come to stress the personal re-
sponsibility not only' of the parent as a
parent, but of the citizen as a citizen.
Lloyd George was quoted at the head of
an article last week. “World-recovery,”
he said, “depends on world-sanity.” What
else can that mean but the recovery of
the feeling of personal responsibility?
The sane world is a world of sane people;
and the sane man is the responsible man.

The Australian Meat Trade.
Meat export and producing interests met
at Melbourne lately and recommended the
Federal Government to form an Australian
Meat Export Council. Such a body is
overdue, for at the distributing end the
Australian meat trade is chaotic compared
with the planned marketing arrangements
of Maoriland and South America. Mutton
and lamb from the pampas is equal to the
Australian average, and, facilitated by a
continuous chilled-beef trade, it reaches
the British butchers in a well-ordered and
regular manner which puts the Australian
to shame. It is true that our trade with
Britain is increasing, but our methods re-
sult in prices below the products’ worth.
We are accustomed to the view that Maori-
land concentrates on the high-class trade,
and the West of England and Scotland have
been looked on as Australia’s natural out-
lets. But South America has been active
here, mainly to counter the intensive two-
year campaign by the N.Z. Meat Producers’
Board. This board issues a handy booklet
of meat grades, etc. Nothing of the sort
would be possible in relation to Australian
meat. Those who sell this meat at, the
other end are greatly hampered also by
irregular shipping. Sometimes supplies are
almost unobtainable; then follows a glut,
making price-cutting necessary to recover
lost ground. Orders for definite quantities
at monthly intervals can in some cases only
be met by sending two lots on the same
boat. Last August the storage problem
in London became so acute that certain
lamb and mutton shipments could not be
discharged. To make matters worse, the
bulk of Australia’s beef output arrived
within a comparatively short space of time.
An Australian Meat Export Council
would find its job no sinecure. A uniform
grading system would be its first responsi-
bility. A minimum standard should be
set, and anything not up to that standard
should stay at home. Shipments should be
regulated, and the market evenly fed, by
planned storage here or in England, or
both. When attention has been given to
these things, the stage will be set for an
advertising campaign. Maoriland has
achieved its place by intelligent marketing
backed up by regular advertising of the
right kind.

Walter Henry Barnes.
During his latter years it was often said
that W. H. Barnes was too slow for a
generation that liked speed in its politics,
as well as in other pursuits. His manners
and some of his sentiments were certainly
old-fashioned. Nevertheless, there was that
in him which is never outmoded altogether,
and to which the world always turns, soonev
or later, when it is in trouble. Lincoln had
it in a supreme degree. Our own Andrew
Fisher had it. Robert Gibson, of the
Commonwealth Bank Board, has it. In a
word, character.
Barnes had turned 70 when he became
Treasurer for the second time, and the de-
pression was only a few months old. He
stuck to his post till his Government was
defeated, but the strain and worry wore
him out. When he realised that his days
were numbered he got a friend to take
down a farewell address to his constituents.
It is a remarkable production for a man
who was so soon to die. ' Sometimes the
thought falters and fades, but only when he
tries to look towards the future, never when
he reflects on the past. He remembers,
“with a thankful heart, all the assist-
ance I have received.” He is “deeply
grateful” to the “boys’ committee” which
helped him 32 years ago to become member
for Bulimba; to the chairman and secretary
of his Wynnum committee; to the news-
papers, “especially the reporters, for their
extreme courtesy to me and for
their general assistance”; to those who
“counted me worthy of Cabinet, positions,”
Philp, Kidston, Denham and Moore.
Moore, his dying lieutenant says, has served
Queensland well; for himself, “I have tried
with all my heart to help Queensland—tried
to help my people.” He had hoped to
review £ully “the present financial position
of Queensland,” but “physically I am un-
able to do so.” But this much he could
say about the position of Australia:
In the way of Treasury bills she has borrowed
£86,000,000." I am thankful that, whilst I was
Treasurer, we did not participate in any w<iy in
the £86,00'0,000. What does borrowing mean?- It
seems this: The more borrowing the more taxation,
and taxation at the present moment has reached
such a height that many . people cannot pay the
amounts demanded of them. .. . This State has ad
the potentialities to bring it to complete recovery,
not by borrowing, but by getting right down to the
facts.
Rarely has it been written of a dead
Australian Treasurer that he could have
plunged his country farther into debt ■■•. and
refused to do it. Let it be Barries s epitaph.

POLITICAL
POINTS
By 49 to 1 the League of Nations
Assembly adopted the report of its Com-
mittee of Nineteen, the substance of which
is that Manchuria (or Maucliukuo) belongs
to China and that the State set up by Japan
should not be recognised. The Japanese
delegates, who, of course, cast the minority
vote, straightway withdrew, and on the same
day their army began knocking Sheol out of
the Chinese in Jehol, which is claimed to
be part of Manchukuo. Under the first
article of the League covenant, Japan lias
to give two years’ notice of its intention to
leave. But if it is held to have violated any
of the pledges which all the associated
nations gave, it “may be declared to be no
longer a member... .by a vote of the Coun-
cil concurred in by the representatives of all
the other members of the League represented
thereon.”
“Get in behind our leader,” is now the
despairing howl of the Lang faction, which
—as happened to the Girondins and the Men-
“The Socialisation group is trying to depose Mr.
Lang.”
KING LANG: “Who said white ants?”
shiviks —is being worsted by the fanatics, in
this case the socialisation group. Last year
the cry was “Fall in behind J. T. Lang.”
The faithful fell in—and fell in.
Revolutionary movements always have an
ascetic quality about them. The four Aus-
tralian Communists who were recently ex-
pelled because they were “agents of the
bourgeoisie in the ranks of the revolutionary
movement” are not the first heretics to suffer
ostracism, by any means. A young Mel-
bourne University student member was cast
forth recently. It was charged against him
that he had been spending too much time
taking bourgeois girls to bourgeois picture
palaces ; so out he went.
South Africa is to have a Hertzog-Smuts
Government, composed of six Nationalists
and six members of the South African party.
Malan, Hertzog’s Minister of the Interior,
would not come in, and Cre,swell, the Aus-
tralian-born leader of one of the Labor
groups (there are two), also steps down,
while Tielman Roos, who started all the talk
about a National Government, has been
cold-shouldered. Tielman Roos, who is
darkly suspected of being Billy Hughes in
disguise, “will now endeavor to form a new
party.”
Queensland Labor’s experience with the
State Wheat Board has administered a check
to its enthusiasm for setting up boards with
plenary powers to control this, that and the
other commodity. When the farmers were
stripping their wheat the Government offered
to buy all the first-grade grain for 3s. 64d.
a bushel at siding, plus any rise in the local
market price. The board held out for better
terms, which were not forthcoming, and
finally rejected the offer last week. Mean-
time no deal has been made with the millers,
holding charges have been piling up and
wheat has poured in from N. S. Wales. Now
it seems likely that a great part of the
Queensland crop will have to be sent overseas,
in which case the growers will not get
half, a crown a bushel, let alone 3s. 6^d.
Four old N.S.W. 4 p.c. loans totalling
£9,600,000 fall, due in London on July 1. Bruce
has arranged for their conversion into a Com-
monwealth loan, redeemable 1955-70, at the
same rate of interest. Not a bad stroke of
business considering the state of the market,
which has been affected by the great British
conversion operations and by the uncer-
tainty about the war debts, the situation
in Germany and the outcome of the struggle
in Manchuria; and considering also the dan-
gerous nonsense which Lang, Beasley and
Scullin have been talking about “nationalis-
ing” the banks and “socialising” credit.
Bruce lias done good work for Australia in
London, though he protests that he is tired
of his mission and would like to return.
Hubert Parker has succeeded the 'late
“Tad” Davy as Westralian Attorney-
General. Son of a former Chief Justice, he
is an amiable individual, and was a Digger;
but he has a very shaky seat. When his
part of Fremantle returned two members
they were nearly always Laborites. The
Attorney-Generalship has been an unlucky
portfolio for members of Parker’s party
under its many names. Moorhead and
Draper (now a Judge) were defeated at the
polls; Pennefather’s tenure of the office
was brief and stormy; Keenan fell out with
the Premier and resigned; Leake, as well
as Davy, died in harness ; Moorhead, Nansoh
and Robinson did not live long after they
hajl completed their terms. Perhaps I arker
will have better fortune.
Gordon Coates, now entering on his second
term as M.L. Minister of Finance —in his
first he added a cool £50,000,000 to the
national debt —has never been famous for
tact. He put his foot into it badly when
he ascribed the opposition of the newspapers
to the boosted exchange rate to the fact that
they are obliged to pay more for newsprint.
Harry Horton, chief proprietor of the N. A
Herald,” hit back solidly at Coates when
addressing the M.L. section of the Empire
Press Union, of which he is president. And
the “Herald” is (or was) the strongest
pillar of Coates’s party.
Visiting Newcastle last week, the Prime
Minister learned that upwards of 5000 men
are employed at the B.H.P. steelworks and
at the Rylands, Lysaglit and Vickers fac-
tories He was also informed that tinplate
will before long be made by that great Aus-
tralian concern the 8.H.P., and that steel
pipes are also on the list of articles to be
manufactured. He said he was delighted to
hear it; but it is to be hoped he won’t go
back to Canberra with the impression that
all is well with the secondary industries.
They are doing better than might be ex-
pected, seeing what they have had to put up
with; but they would do better still —a
great deal better —if they were relieved of
some of the taxes which plague them, and
of uncertainty about the tariff.
Mr. Beasley complains that he has been
vilely misrepresented. “S. M. Herald” re-
ported him as having said at Lithgow that
“if any arroups stood in the way of. the
socialisation of credit when Labor achieves
power, the whole forces of the Army and
Navy would be brought to play”; whereas
these were his actual words: —
When Labor has achieved power the socialisation
of credit will he given effect to. It will then
be the law of the land. As the Army, Navy and
police force are there to see that the country’s laws
“What game are you playing, Jack?”
“We’ve socialised credit, see, and I’m the
admiral, the general and the commis-
sioner of police.”
are obeyed, these forces will be brought to play
against any organisations or groups which attempt
to frustrate the expressed will of the people.
The only difference is that the “Herald” re-
port is terser. Anyway, the authorised ver-
sion engenders doubts which should be dis-
pelled. Thrifty people will certainly object
to depositing funds in One Big Bank run by
politicians like Mr. Beasley when the same
politicians will have control of the note
issue. Will the soldiers, seamen and police
be called out as an initial step to coerce
these people into handing over their money,
or will Mr. Beasley wait till the strike is on?
The argument between the Queensland
Labor Government and the Wheat Board
has brought out some remarkable facts about
transport costs. For shifting not less than
a truckload of wheat the charges are
Is. 4d. a bushel from Sydney to Cairns,
Is. 94d. from Darling Downs to Cairns and
Is. lid. from Darling Downs to London. It
costs’more to take Darling Downs wheat to
any part of Queensland north of Rockhamp-
ton than it does to land it in London. These
are the things that try countrymen’s- souls.
In obedience to orders from Sydney, Col-
laton, the Adelaide Assemblyman who got
in at a by-election as a representative of
the Lang Labor party, had to deposit a
signed and undated resignation with its
bosses. When he fell out with them and
joined the Lang Labor party No. 2, they
handed the thing in, but the Speaker refused
to accept it. Dale, M.L. A., the sole remain-
ing member of the Lang Labor party, has
now been informed that he (together with
other candidates, if any) must “lodge a
“I’ll make it a million if you like, com-
rade A bloke can always repudiate,
as our great leader did.”
guarantee in the form of a promissory note
for £lOO, made out in favor of the Lang
Labor party, and payable should he break
the policy, rules or pledges, or attempt to
circumvent them.” It is expected that he
will refuse and start a Lang Labor party
No. 3.
High overseas authorities support the
opinion of Sydney medical men that there
is a danger of yellow fever being brought to
Australia by air-pilots out after “records.”
Tests made by the Ross Institute and the
London Hospital for Tropical Diseases show
that it is possible for infected mosquitoes to
be transferred from West Africa to almost
any spot on the earth’s surface during the
period of incubation, which is sometimes
three months ; in one experiment, 22 p.c. of
mosquitoes carried on a long journey were
alive at the end of 1250 miles. International
preventive measures are suggested, and the
Commonwealth will have to join in them.
It can dispense with the performances of
people like the Mollisons, daring as they may
be; but it cannot afford to run the risk of
being smitten with yellow fever.
Westralian Premier Mitchell forgot to
mention secession in his policy speech at
Northam, but let himself go on the subject
in the breezy atmosphere of Busselton. Said
Jimmy:—
I am not opposed to Federation on any senti-
mental ground, but I do say we cannot pay the
cost. Our representation in the Federal Parliament
is totally inadequate, as our interests are vastly
different from those of the larger States. Last
year Federation cost us £51,879,(100 in taxation to
the Federal Government and in the extra cost of
goods we have had to import.
Westralia, with 423,000 people, has the
same number of Commonwealth Senators
(six) as N. S. Wales, with 2,560,000 people.
In the House of Reps, it has one member
per 70,500 people, whereas N. S. Wales
has one per 427,000. Its imports last year
were valued by its Government Statistician
at £7,926,858, and its gross Customs and
excise collections (representing the greater
part of its contribution to Commonwealth
revenue) amounted to £1,721,929. From the
same Commonwealth it received £773,432 —
£473,432 for interest and £300,000 under the
State Grants Act —which was only £233,484
less than the revenue raised by all Mitchell’s
taxes. The Busselton ozone must have gone
to Jimmy’s head.
A correctly-stamped and -addressed letter
with MS. for The Bulletin was posted in
Melbourne on a Sunday in time to catch
that day’s mail. It did not arrive in Sydney
till Wednesday, by which time the “copy”
—a racing report —had ceased to have value,
the current issue having been published.
Asked what had happened to the letter be-
tween Monday, when it should have been
available, and Wednesday, the authorities
took between four and five weeks to reply,
and then said they had no idea. But that’s
nothing. It is upwards of 11 months since
people from Sydney’s North Shore suburbs
began to detrain and entrain at Wynyard
station; but there is still no post-office at
Wynyard, nor even a letter-box. “I can ring
up Czecho-Slocakia on tlie telephone,” said
a Vic. manufacturer the other day, “but I
can’t ring up Tasmania.” This P., T. and
T. Department is a great institution —for
the staff.
A Royal Commissioner, Dr. Hyman
Herman, reported to the Westralian Gov-
ernment last month that the prices it had
been charged for Collie coal were out-
rageous : “in eleven years, the Railway
Department paid £828,000 too much, the
East Perth power station £253,000 too
much.” Evans, the man in control of the
railways and the power station, naturally
expected as a result that the Collie crowd
would be less greedy, but in tendering for
a further twelvemonth’s supplies it stag-
gered him by demanding another Is. 2d. a
ton for large coal and another Is. 4d. a ton for
small coal 1 —£20,000 more altogether. Evans
said he wouldn’t buy at those rates, and the
Collie concerns replied that they would
rather close down than take what he offered.
For once the Government is backing up its
Commissioner. Cowardly surrender lias been
the custom hitherto—and not in Westralia
alone —when mineowners and miners have
put their heads together.
Sydney's Metropolitan Land Board has
rightly put its foot down on a proposal to
grab a fairly large area of Bondi Park, in
which there are Norfolk pines and other
things of beauty, for switchback railways,
chocolate-wheel joints and the like. Bondi
beach has become a sort of concrete metro-
polis, crowded with buildings and motor
causeways, which most people who visit the
resort don’t want to use, and which, accord-
ing to an alderman’s estimate, are costing
the Waverley ratepayers about £BOOO a year.
Building more enclosures round the few re-
maining open spaces on and inear the big
beaches that are supposed to be public pro-
perty won’t popularise them. As experience
has proved, it has the reverse effect.
Bernie Corser, the Cocky member for
Wide Bay (Q.), declares that there is no
difference of opinion between his group and
the U.A.P., and that no Country-party
member in Canberra, Sydney or Melbourne
has any authority to make assertions to the
contrary. Numerous Cookies have been
making them, particularly Hunter, the mem-
ber for Maranoa (Q.). Perhaps Hunter has
abandoned hope of being included in a
composite Ministry. In this connection
Hunter may be a pessimist, and Corser an
optimist.
“Princess Hermione is on a visit to Berlin. Hitler
said to her that, much as he revered the Hohen-
zollerns, the time for restoration was not ripe.”
“Vot, drag meinself out of der limelight
ven it took me years to ged in it?
Lady, you ask too mooch.”
Members of the League of Nations have
undertaken “to respect and preserve.... the
territorial integrity and existing political in-
dependence of all members” (article X),
and, in case of “any dispute likely to lead
to rupture,” to “submit the matter either
to arbitration or to inquiry; and they agree
in no case to resort to war until three
months after the award or report” (article
XII). It is asserted by English pacifist
Freetraders of the type that wanted Britain
to keep out of the Great War and make
money out of the combatants that Japan
has violated both articles. So they have
the face to propose that article XVI should
be enforced
Should any member of the League resort to war
in disregard of its covenants, it shall ipso facto
be deemed to have committed an act of war against
all members of the League, which hereby under-
takes immediately to subject it to the severance of
all trade and financial relations. .. .and the preven-
tion of all financial, commercial or. personal inter-
course.
There is also a reference to “the armed
forces” to be used to protect the covenants.
Australia’s interest in the Manchurian situa-
tion is remote. If there is the slightest
danger of the Freetrade pacifists of Man-
chester and the bellicose Swiss of Geneva
having article XVI invoked, it will have to
beg to be excused.

just as two trams were passing. Onlookers
saw a man staggering from his jump from
one tram, whilst a woman, apparently con-
templating a descent, clung on the foot-
board of the other. Tram-brakes screamed
and motors bumped into one another; in the
midst of the mess-up the couple dropped
into one another’s arms, whilst some angry
motorists, several tram officials and a police-
man came up to demand an explanation.
The man gave it: “This was my sweet-
heart, in Melbourne, eight years ago. We
haven’t met all that time, and I didn't
know she was in Sydney till two minutes
ago.” P.-C. 429 looked at the motorists and

and turned to move on the crowd. The
couple hailed a taxi.
“C.Q.”: A Vic. civil servant of over 60
years has turned the tables neatly on the
department he has served for over 40 years.
It asked him to accept a lump sum in lieu
of pension. As a bachelor, his pension would
have been small; married, he would, get a
fairly good one. He decided to relinquish'
the cares of office, and named the sum he
was prepared to take. The department
replied that his claim was out of all reason,
and he would have to think again. He did.
He married a girl of 18 years, and informed liis
superiors that he would serve out his time.
“Lex”: The editor of the
“Whitehall Gazette,” who has
to do two months for offering
to get the Australian Lieut.-
Commander Billyard - Leake,
R.N., a title for £lO,OOO, had
hard luck. Until the middle of
the. war, when Lords Salisbury
and Selborne fomented an agi-
tation against the sale of
honors, the practice was per-
fectly respectable. Fixed sums
were paid to the party funds,
ranging from £lO,OOO for baron-
etcies to £50,000 for peerages,
and the proceeds were used to
get desirable men into the
House of Commons. Most of
Lloyd George’s famous “Fund”
was amassed in this way. Lord
Curzon (Cons.) and Hilaire
Belloc (Lib.) both admitted
during the row referred to
above that they couldn’t have
entered politics without help
from their party funds. After
the passing of the Honors (Pre-
vention of Abuses) Act the pro-
cedure was altered slightly, but
rich men still went on buying
titles. The present arrange-
ment is for the would-be bart.
or baron to subscribe lavishly
to some public object—prefer-
ably one such as cancer re-
search, in which the King is
interested and promise to
stand by the party afterwards.
Assuming there is no question
of the aspirant’s financial
stability, his name duly appears
in an honors list. It will
almost certainly be found, when
the London papers arrive, that
Mr. Gregory fell in not because
lie offered to negotiate a title, but because
he had no authority to do it.

speech was illustrated by diagrams and
typed notes, thrown on to a screen from a
powerful lantern. The lecturer finished with
the first of his charts, and tapped the floor
with the butt of his pointer, the signal for
a new diagram. We sat in darkness for a
split second; and then, on the blinding
screen, appeared the following legend:—

back its head and laughed most unprofession-
ally.

“Turl”: The Oxford Union Society has
stirred up trouble by passing a resolution
“That this House will in no circumstances
fight for King and country”—or words to
that effect. If war on any scale should come
again, it wouldn’t matter much what this
“House” did. The Union ,is simply a club,
plus a debating society. Hundreds of
graduates and undergraduates belong to it,
paying £1 a term for the privilege, with life
membership after three years; many more
don’t. Even of those who do belong the
majority seldom go near the weekly debates.
And in any university debating .society you
will find speakers and controversialists as
“advanced” as you might find them in Moscow
or at the Sydney Trades Hall. It may be a
disquieting sign of the times that such a
resolution should come from any university
body, but the Union can no more speak for
Oxford in general than the tailors of Tooley-
street could speak for the people of England.

“Oh, well, I don’t blame him—the poor little devil wasn’t allowed to be bold at home.”
all three thoroughfares, I am inclined to
think that the only respect in which Collins -
street scores is that it has no awful
statuary. Otherwise there is no more
resemblance than between Main-street, Reedy
Dam, and a garden suburb. Unter den Linden
is less a street than a park with immense
trees in it. The Nevsky is a planned thor-
oughfare with alcoves in which stand
churches, cathedrals and public buildings, set
back so that they can be seen to the best
advantage. Collins-street is a gully of trade
and commerce, in which tall, spindly build-
ings in every known style of architecture
jostle each other along the sidewalks on
allotments narrower, in many cases, than a
Savings Bank home.

Italian, it seems, becomes a “wop”
in street argot; and the Mayor of
Chicago, who recently stopped a
bullet intended for President-elect
Roosevelt, was referred to despite-
fully by ex-Mayor “Big Bill”
Thompson as “Tony the Bohunk.”
Webster affords no information
about the derivation of either
“wop” or “bohunk,” but it looks
as if Bohemia furnished material
for the latter word. Italians, by
the way, in the days wdien they
were plentiful on the Westralian
mines and woodlines, were as often
referred to as “Skis” as “Dagoes.”
For some unascortainable reason
they developed an intense dislike
to the former word, professing to
detect in it some hidden oppro-
brium.

“Runa”: A schoolgirl howler
this time. A Maoriland damsel,
finding “What do you know about
the Wars of the Roses?” on her
paper, replied, possibly with a hazy
recollection of Fair Rosamond at the back of
her mind, “The Roses were some ladies the
Kings and Queens quarrelled about.”

“H'.A.D.”: Dodges for securing seclusion
in a railway compartment (B. 8/2/’33) ? A
married couple were off to Melbourne. _ They
found the train well filled, and were thinking
of paying the extra money for sleepers, when
one of their friends had a brainwave. He
rushed off, bought a packet of confetti,
enlisted a few confederates, and showered
the stuff over the couple as soon as they
had taken their seats. Immediately the
three strangers in the compartment _ sought
seats elsewhere. But the plan didn’t work
as well as it might have done. The guard,
after making some strong remarks about
confetti being contrary to the bylaws, re-
turned with a very self-conscious young
couple, and put them into the same compart-
ment. “Two more of the same sort,” he
added grimly.
“Ariota”: When I was a probationer we
always ran late when returning from leave.
But rve never lacked comfortable seats for our
journey, hqwever packed the train. Drawing
long faces we would approach the most pros-
perous-looking commercials and politely ask
if w r o might sit in their compartment till ■we
reached the Sanatorium. They never refused
us; nor did they ever stay a moment longer
than they could' help in our company.

“T.P.”: When Albert Berger (68) at
the windlass of a prospecting shaft at Bunin-
yong (Vic.) saw his mate, Dunstan, who
was fixing an airpipe midway, let go the
rope and crash to the bottom, he ordered
the other man on top to lower him. “He’s
alive but hurt. Go for help!” he shouted.
,T. Silvey arrived; a candle-test showed
carbon monoxide, but he risked it. Twice
he was hauled up semi-conscious. Then
W. R. Sandford. swathing his mouth with
vinegar-soaked towels, went below. He brought
Berger’s body to the surface quickly; after
20 minutes’ spell he did the same for the
other —and then collapsed. Dr. Frank li.
Longden was soon on the- spot —just as he
was 45 years ago, when there was an acci-
dent in an adjacent mine, and men came in
haste from their beds to save mates in
grave danger below. No lives were lost then ;
and some days later we dragged the protesting
rescuers to a crowded hall to honor them—
the Minister for Mines present. There were
many speeches but all that could be
out of the rescuers’ spokesman was: “Our
mates, so we got ’em out, of course. Much
obliged to everybody from the Inspector of
Mines down to the Minister.” The Aus-
tralian miner is like that.
“Plutus”: When gas accumulates at the
bottom of a shaft the thing to do is to get
a circulation of air from up above. The
man on the surface should unwind the wind-
lass rope, tie a fairly large btisli thereto,
throw it down the shaft and pull it up
rapidly, repeating the process again and
again. Another method is to take a bucket
of water and lap it into the shaft by hand,
so as to make as wide a spray as possible.
❖ ❖ *
“X.S.”: The Vic. taxpayer will have to
fork out for this faux pas. A case
was being tried in which a man was
accused of having entered a factory by a
certain window. Doubt was raised as to
which window was involved, and the Crown
Prosecutor remarked that it would be a
bright idea if the jury inspected the scene.
After lunch the foreman got up and told
’Sonali that he had been along, and he
thought the rest of his colleagues on the
jury ought to go too. Result: Jury dis-
charged and prisoner remanded for a new
trial.
* * * *
“Jeamcs”: “Mr, S. M. Bruce,” said a
cable, “strongly favors the idea of asking
the King to appoint a member of the Royal
family as Governor-General”; and it went
on to point out that “members of the
Royal family have served as Governors-
General of South Africa.” The S. African
analogy is irrelevant. Nothing could make
certain Boers approve of a British G.-G.; so,
naturally, nothing could make the local
Britishers disapprove. The blacks don’t
count. An Australian G.-G. needs many
qualifications if he is not to bring scorn and
obloquy on himself and his office. Notably,
the virtue of a St. Anthony allied to the
sobriety of a Grand Master of the Recha-
bites’ Order; enough social tact to enable
him to bring the wives of a newly-arrived
city politician and of an old-established
grazier together in something resembling
amity; a sound working knowledge of Aus-
tralian and English constitutional law, and
the horse sense and resolution to apply his
knowledge rightly. Even if a young or
youngish royalty could be found who mea-
sured up to such renuirements he would be
liable to be attracted by some particular set
of people and arouse black jealousy, hatred
and malice in that way. The Prince is said
~to be Britain’s best ambassador —a master
of the art of making himself and his family
popular—yet he had plenty of critics in the
higher reaches of Australian society after
he had been here for a few weeks. The ex-
planation? He was youngish, and a human
being.
THE PLATER-WRITER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Well, now these Tests are over at last, and
the tumult dies, and the shout,
Let us thank the Lord for one absentee
we’ve been much better without.
Say what you like of the Board of Control,
and I daresay most of it’s true,
But don’t forget that we’re in their debt for
the ban that was overdue
So long on the double-barrelled job of playin’
an’ writin’ too,
Yes, I know that champions still may fight
their battles over the air,
And tell how matches were won or lost—
but they’re warned to be cautious there.
And it isn’t the gabbled summary that gives
you cause to chew ;
It’s the written word, not the drone that’s
heard, which raises the hullabaloo
When some flannelled hero insists on bein’
player an’ writer too.
You may use the bat to slash and cut, but
there’s bound to be trouble when
You put it down to cut and slash (as you’re
apt. to do) with the pen.
It’s odds you’ll trample on someone’s corns
when you pass the game in review,
With stabs and stings for the various things
that didn’t appeal to you
In your triple rble of cricketing Crichton,
critic an’ chronicler too.
Oh, whether it’s war or mimic war, I’ll take
my gospel oath,
A chap should be one thing or the other
and not aspire to be both.
You may be combatant or scribe, the coach
or one of the crew,
But, whatever you get, you’ll find you’re
set all you can manage to do;
He shoulders a load like Issachar’s who’s
player an’ writer too.
You may reckon the Board of Control rushed
in where angels wouldn’t have rushed,
That they ought to have their occiputs read
and their cerebella brushed.
But whatever chumps they made of them-
selves with that bodyline halloo,
They shouldn’t lack a pat on the back —
let’s give the Devil his due—
For outing that “giddy liarumfrodite”—
player an’ writer too.

T. THE R.


“D.”: I get, broadly, two varieties of
speech over my wireless. Our sporting
announcers, particularly the cricketers,
have Australian accents ranging in degree
from marked to excruciating. Far be it from
me to sneer at the Australian accent; I
have one myself, and so have most of my
friends. But it is a distinct liability out-
side Australia. The other kind of radio speech
may be described as Balliam-Mayfair. It
is mostly employed by women who boost
goods on sale in city shops. An agonis-
ing, gentility, a hyper-refined cooing of tor-
tured vowels, is its chief characteristic.
PROTECTING THE BCD.
“How did poor Jimmy get that dreadful
black eye?”
“He was waiting outside the theatre for a
chorus girl.”
“Yes! And her boy friend came along?”
“No. Her grandson came out and gave him
a hiding.”
(‘ Hulloo-00, lisnahs! Did you evali think
of the praceless boo-oon of a reelee good
feece-powdah?”) Of the two I much prefer
the Australian (“Thereor// Sunny Dyes
got left at the barrier. Here’s Clowsing
Toime coming up on the ahtsoide!”) ; but
they’re both wrong. Our chief weakness lies
in the way we pronounce our “a’s” and
“i’s” —the whole world says so, and the
whole world can’t be wrong.
; '“N.B.F.”: There _ is at least one station
from which there is no danger of acquir-
ing The alleged Oxford drawl or the mincing
accents of the shopgirl. Here rugged democ-
racy lets itself go, disdaining affectations,
and the Testrmatch comments might come
direct from, the Hill. Batsmen were making
boundary .strokes “off of” Allen or Voce with
pleasant frequency when the announcer broke
off for a moment to * indulge in a reminis-
cence' of how Woodfull and co. went to
England in 1930 and “brung home the
bacon.” There was a tinge of real annoy-
ance in his voice, however, when he recorded
the too-frequent appearances of the twelfth
man on the field with refreshments for the
sweating fieldsmen. “Drinks ev’ry half-
hour,” it’ was learned, “was enough to make
blokes go crook.” i
* # * *
“Buna”: At the time of the Christchurch
Exhibition, about 25 years ago, M.L. experi-
enced its first invasion 'of gipsies, who were
soon making' good money, at their ancient'
game of futurity reading. I was in a city
jeweller’s one day when two gipsy women
entered and offered to read my fate.; pleas-
antly thrilled, I was about to part with a
piece, of-silver when the jeweller sighted the
ladies. Fie did not wait to go round his
counter, but sprang over it, and in a thun-
dering voice ordered the women out of the
shop. Then he wiped a perspiring brow and
remarked, “Sorry, but it’s not safe to let
tnose people stay around. They’ve got some
kind of witchcraft. One went into my
brother’s shop the other day, and before he
knew what he was doing he’d given her a
ring and two brooches; he said afterwards
he was powerless to prevent her having any
jewellery she asked for while she was look-
ing at him!” And now I read that the
tellers in three Auckland banks have been
mesmerised by a gipsy and mulcted of money.
# * * *
“Whitehall” : I picked up a Sydney paper
the other day and read a series of com-
plaints by Mr. ITales, M.P. for Hanley:—
Every year £lOO,OOO is paid by Indian civil
servants to foreign steamship companies instead of
to British companies. It means that we are actually
subsidising foreign companies with taxpayers’ money
in their competitive war against British shipping.
The matter is so serious that the Government must
take some definite action.
Then I turned over the page and found this:
The Governor and Lady Game entertained about
150 visitors from the tourist liner Lurline at Govern-
ment House.
Who ever heard of a N.S.W. State Governor
entertaining, as such, a party of tourists
over from Melbourne or Brisbane to see a
Test? Who ever heard of P. and O. or Orient
Co. tourists being welcomed at Government
Hduse after grand tour of Noumea
or Norfolk Island? Yet such people are far
more deserving of encouragement than Ameri-
cans who come here on State-subsidised ships
which are doing a lot to keep British in-
vestors out of dividends, and British and
Australian seamen out of jobs.
* * * *
“Bellman”: “Shah Jehan” professes to
see nothing out of the way in the sentence
passed on the Indian who has to serve 12
months and then lose his head (B.
22/2/’33), but one may doubt its legal
soundness, as the Judge in “The Hunting
of the Snark” did in the case of “Trans-
portation for life and then to be fined forty
pound.” It is difficult to see any real
analogy' between the fortnight or so that a
condemned man gets in Australia before the
hangman arrives and the Hyderabad sen-
tence. The fortnight is given to enable the
murderer to repent. To that end he receives
every consideration, short of liberty. But 12
months’ hard labor could hardly be expected
to put a malefactor in a better and more
edifying frame of mind to be executed. To
keep an able-bodied man at unremitting toil
for a year, with nothing but death to look
forward to at the end of it, is surely the
refinement of cruelty.
* * % *
“Crystal Palace”: “Wapping” says he
cannot recall any fatalities through divers
going over any of the Thames bridges for
a wager or publicity (B. l/2/’33). One
occurred when a man went off the top of
the Tower Bridge soon after it was opened
in 1894; it was three days before the body
was recovered. Strangely enough, he was a
man who was used to diving from the roof
of the Westminster Aquarium into a tank of
water about three feet in depth. But it
is probable that he made the fatal leap
before he was properly prepared; the
authorities had set their ’faces against
any such attempt and it was only by a
ruse that he managed to reach the outside.
Clothed in white overalls and with paint-pot
in hand he took his place in the painting
gang always at work on the bridge and
managed to evade observation.

“Davy”: May I suggest that the Post and
Telegraph Department instal radio_ tele-
phony between Brisbane and Perth?
Had two calls the other day. The
first, to' London, w r as perfect and
could not have been distinguished
from a local call; the second was to
Perth. I could not hear my friend
in the West; we owed it to the moni-
tor at Adelaide, who acted as inter-
preter, that we were able to make
ourselves understood during a three-
way conversation lasting 15 minutes.
The business would have been completed in
two minutes if we could have spoken direct
to each other. In fairness I should add that
the department charges for one call.
* * * *
“Nupkins” : When Henry Labouchero ran
London “Truth,” ’a feature of the paper was
its “Legal Pillory,” where harsh sentences
imposed by magistrates were contrasted
with lenient ones. Britain has no
monopoly of Justice Shallows; the other day
at Bendigo a man appealed against a sen-
tence of 12 months’ imprisonment passed on
him at Mildura for having played two-
up! Judge Wdlnarski had no difficulty in
deciding that the sentence was “most exces-
sive” and no hesitation in altering it to a
fine of £5, with the option of 14 days. Then,
finding that the appellant had just com-
pleted the 14 days, he ordered his imme-
diate release.
* * * *
“Spore”: That method of counteracting
malaria by l’endering those infected immune
by means of plasmoquin (B. 8/2/’S3) is
by no means new. Drs. Sinton, V.C., and
Christopher, from the Calcutta School of
Medicine and the Ivasuli Institute in the
Punjab respectively, have been using it suc-
cessfully in the Burdwan district, in India, a
notorious hotbed of the disease which has
destroyed whole civilisations. If the experi-
ment. ultimately proves successful, the saving
in the cost of fighting malaria will be a very
considerable one. Plasmoquin, a German
discovery, is a synthetic form of quinine, and
resulted from a search for a drug as effica-
cious as the cinchona product but less costly.
* * * * ’
“C. Coral”: The Barrier Reef should be
a fruitful field for buried-treasure .seekers.
It was at the top of the Barrier that quite
a respectable sum in Spanish coin was
come upon some 40 years or so ago in the
mouldering remains of an old wreck; and at
Murray Island, only a few miles distant.
Spanish gold coins, have been located by the
natives at various times —they formed part
of the contents of boxes which, according
to local tradition, came ashore on rafts
accompanied by their owners. As heads
were valuable and the islanders were off the
gold standard, the unfortunate owners were
beheaded, and the contents of the boxes were
used as counters in a native game in which
the big round bean seed usually figured.
There are hundreds of wrecks strewn along
the Barrier and amongst the Torres Strait
reefs, and doubtless the Spanish ship re-
ferred to wasn’t the only one of its kind
that failed to get to its destination. There
is a legend amongst Strait divers of a sunken
ship out Eastern Fields way which has a
silver keel. Expeditions have been at
work on Stephens Island, in the Strait,
searching for a mysterious box which came
ashore with a castaway couple, one of whom
was a woman wearing rich jewels; but the
FAR CHEAPER.
MRS. NEWRICH: “I think it’s just lovely to have your own money to play with,
don’t you, Mr. Cohen?”
MR.COHEN: “Ah, veil, I mooch rather blay vith odder people’s, myself.”
treasure, presumably jewels, was never dis
covered. Another party also turned over
the island looking for an important parcel
of missing documents relating to English
family affairs, which legal advisers had said
. were deposited there by shipwrecked people,
but these also still await discovery.
* * * Sjc
“Bloggs”: That Sydney policeman re-
ferred to by “D.” (B. 15/2/’33) who ran
a lady in for unseemly language on the sub-
ject of the Bible, though he himself was
admittedly in the dark about Solomon,
Samuel and other Biblical characters, was
imagined by Robert Dynd, the English
humorist, long ago. Lynd’s policeman raided
a building after the extirpation of Chris-
tianity. As he dashed upstairs a printed
sheet was put into his hands containing the
opening words of a seditious poem :
I was a wandering sheep,
I did not love the fold.
He found the prisoner on a platform. ,
“The prisoner,’’ said the policeman, “shut his
eyes and turned his face up to the ceiling and asked
for help.” “Help against what?” demanded the
magistrate. “Against the Government?” “That
was my suspicion, your Worship.” “And did you
hear anything actually subversive said?” “To tell
you the truth, your Worship, I couldn’t make head
or tail of what the prisoner was talking about, but
I heard him saying that they must all pledge their
loyalty to some kingdom or other called Heaven.”
“And no doubt the forbidden name of God was
mentioned?” “Mentioned?” exclaimed the police-
man ; “it was all over the shop.”
An interesting proof that just as “Nature
tends to imitate Art” so policemen tend to
imitate literature.

“ .Tungor”; The Vic. police, armed with
spades and other implements, are reported
THE WEDDING MARCH.
“Remember, Willie dear, from now on, no more
foolishness.”
“Foolishness! Is there anything worse I can do than
I have just done?”
to be making an intensive search over a
farm near Warragul, where it. is suspected
that an infant has been buried. As the
farm is 370 acres in extent and covered
with bracken and undergrowth, it would
seem that they have no light job ahead of
them. It recalls the search for the body of
a murdered woman in Perth. A foundry-
worker had done away wfith his wife, prior
to marrying another young woman (who
knew nothing of her predecessor’s existence).
After some months the first wife’s disap-
pearance was noted and the husband was
duly arrested. The case looked black enough
against him; the one thing necessary to
complete the chain of evidence was the
discovery of the remains. So the police
went to work with picks and spades in all
sorts of places. What put them on a false
scent was the knowledge that the prisoner
had made several trips into the bush' with
a cart shortly after his wife had disappeared.
Hence, after a cursory examination of the
foundry-yard, police parties went further
afield, seeking to follow their man’s probable
routes and delving assiduously wherever the
soil seemed to have been disturbed. After
weeks of hard and fruitless work they de-
cided on a more thorough overhaul of the
foundry-yard. Here, at last, they found
what they were looking for; the murdered
woman’s corpse had been, buried a few feet
under the spot where' the murderer was
accustomed to eat his lunch. He was hanged.
* si= * *
“Boz”: It has been asserted that the
British infantry uniform is based on the de-
signs used J>y the United States Army. The
statement is hardly in accordance with fact,
for the upper half of the U.S.A. uniform for
years past has been a shirt-like garment
tucked into the breeks. Nor is the Yankee
headgear a nondescript “deerstalker” out-
rage, but a flat-brimmed hat closely resem-
bling that of the Maorilanders. The Dough-
boys certainly wear gaitefs, but with
breeches and not the British plus-fours. As
far as the officers are concerned, there is no
borrowing from Yankeeland. It is the
other way about, the Americans having
wholeheartedly adopted the open tunic with
collar and tie and the Sam Browne belt,
which was borrowed by the British from
the Bokhariat belts of the North-west
Frontier of India.
* * * *
“Kariah” : A local storekeeper in our north-
ern N.S.W. township is a stickler for accu-
racy. He had a dispute
over the quality of certain
of his goods with one of
his customers; the latter,
losing his temper, rudely
referred to his antagonist
as “a Greek blankard.”
The aspersed one drew
himself up and with dig-
nity replied: “I Assyrian
blankard, not Greek bland-
ard.”
❖ * *
“Bert the Carpenter”:
Back in the happy days of
the building boom it was
the easiest thing on earth
for an artisan to get work;
usually all that you had
to do was to tell the boss
that* you were a trades-
man. But nowadays you
have to use your head.
Twice recently I turned up
when carpenters were
advertised for, but, after
one look at the dimensions
of the crowd awaiting the
arrival of the boss, I
turned away. On the third
occasion I tried a different
method. Instead of join-
ing the anxious crowd in
front I took my tool-bag
in the side , entrance,
donned my overalls, and
■started work when the
whistle blew. No one said
a word to me for a week,
except when the time-
keeper asked me my nan-.
Then one day I saw the
contractor looking at me
with a puzzled frown, and
presently he came ever and
put the question I had
been long expecting. I met
him with a disarming grin
and the. frank admission : “No.one told me to
start here; I just walked in a. week ago and
began to work.” He spluttered a bit, but I
lvasn’t sacked.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Some live on love,
Or say they do. Reply not “Stuff!”
(Some live on love)
Nor seek by argument to prove
The thing’s absurd, romantic bluff;
If they believe, it is enough.
Some live on love.
Some live on hope.
Though luckless winds blow cold or hot,
Some live on hope.
Their solace, this, and home-made dope,
Who “bate of heart or hope no jot”;
Though hopeless often is their lot,
Some live on hope.
Some merely live.
Content with wealth or placid wife,
Some merely live.
They seek not, neither do they give,
Love, glory, art, ambitious strife;
And then, O God, they call it Life!
Some merely live.

Justice Smith, of the M.L. Supreme Court,
is to represent the U.S.A. on the Perma-
nent Commission which adjudicates disputes
between Uncle Sam and Peru. The job
doesn’t endanger his allegiance to- the Crown,
as it is a condition of the appointment that
tlie member must not be an American. There
is no dispute to adjudicate on so far.
D. S. Smith is one of the youngest Judges
M.L. has ever had, being only 45. He rose
to the Bench in 1928, after practically only
eight years’ practice of the law, his legal
career having been entrenched upon by war
service.
William Butler Geddes, new Under-Secre-
tary of the N.S.W. Dept, of Justice, lias
spent more than two-thirds of his 52 years
in the Public Service. Born at Warialda
(N.S.W.), after a Maitland High School
education he became a junior clerk at 17
in the Petty Sessions Branch of the Dept,
of Justice. For years he was a relieving

officer and served at one time or another in
most parts of the State. Following a period
when he was a chamber magistrate at the
Central Police Court, Sydney, he became
P.M. at Grafton, and was taken from the
Bench in 1924 to be Assistant Under-Secre-
tary of the department he now controls.
Supervisor of Census Harold Green is the
son of a Shepparton (Vic.) clergyman. He
entered the Chief Statistician’s office in
1911 when Knibbs was Consul, left it to
put in four years in khaki, collecting a com-
mission and a severe wound, and did some
good post-war work at Australia House in
investigating war expenditure and kindred
matters. At the census of 1921 he was
secretary and right-hand man of supervisor
Wickens. Green is still in his thirties.
R. D. Nicholls is a good, typical S. Aus-
tralian public man—a wheat cocky, terribly
in earnest about the tribulations of the man
on the land, interested in “institutes”
(S.A.’s public libraries are all “institutes”),
and a local preacher. He was born in the
State —at Nantawarra—has been M.L.A.
for Stanley for 38 years and was once Chair-
man of Committees. He is in the public
R. D. NICHOLLS, M.L.A. ( S. Aus.).
eye these days as the most active local advo-
cate of the plan of reducing the wheat area
under agreement with other great wheat-
exporting countries. Canada, the U.S.A. and
the Argentine, he says, arc all interested
in this movement. He is a director also of
the S.A. Farmers’ Co-operative Union, whose
activities were discussed on the “Wild Cat”
page on February 1.
Hubert Parker, Westralia’s new Attorney-
General, is a son of a man who helped to
make a lot of history in the colony that was.
Stephen Henry Parker was still an impul-
sive young barrister when he threw himself
whole-heartedly into the political and judi-
cial rows which distinguished the Governor-
ship of Broome in the ’eighties; there is
still a tradition of how he once rode on
horseback from Perth to Albany to take
boat for the east and escape from some
danger zone of the period. When Westralia
obtained responsible government it was a
toss-up whether John Forrest or Stephen
Parker would be the first Premier; the
former carried the day, and the pair never
hit it afterwards. Parker served as Colo-
nial Secretary in the Cabinet for a couple
of years, when he rather dramatically re-
signed, resenting being treated as a subor-
dinate rather than as _ a colleague. That
was the end of him politically; but, return-
ing to his briefs, he presently reached the
Behch and sat. there for a dozen years, more
than half the time as C.J. He died in Mel-
bourne, an octogenarian, a few years ago.
The new Attorney-General’s mother was a
Leake —the Leakes. like the Parkers, are one
of Westralia’s traditional “Six Families.”
A. J. Villiers, the Tasmanian journalist
who made such a hit with the “Wind-
jammer” film, is now part-owner of a sailing-
ship, the Palma, and leaves Wallaroo shortly
for a voyage to London via the Horn, with
all the appurtenances for making another
celluloid sea saga, including a heroine The
latter is Sonya Lind, a Norwegian girl.
Passed out at 71 in Perth. Alexander
Montgomery, who had a widely gathered
store of mining knowledge. Born in Scot-
land and educated in M.L., he graduated at
Dunedin Uni. and was successively in charge
of the Thames School of Mines and an In-
spector of Mines in Tasmania. When the
Westralian Government, decided to appoint
a State Mining Engineer, Montgomery
landed the billet from a host of candidates,
and filled it for 28 years, retiring in 1930.
One son fell in the war ; two are doctors m
England.
Australia has heard again from Percy
Grainger. He offers to make a non-commer-
cial tour and also wants to erect a Grainger
Museum in the Melb. Uni. grounds. The
museum will be dedicated to preserving relics
of the Norwegian composer Grieg, who has
always been the Australian composer-
pianist’s chief inspiration.
Sydney’s Tom Henley, who has been
bumped off the Water Board, was the one
knight among the 33 aspirants for seats on
a body that has the spending of millions of
money. Tom wms born in Wiltshire 73 years
ago; he. began as a mechanic, in which
capacity, lie once assured Assembly Labor
members, he always used to sing and whistle
on the way to work. He has been an
M.L.A. nearly as long as he has been a
Water Boardsman, and was once even a
Minister, but he chafed under the restraints
of office.
Earle Huntley, one of Australia’s best-
known mining men, a former manager of
the Zinc Corporation, has died at Temora
(N.S.W.), where he was trying to resurrect
some old gold shows. Huntley, who got his
training at the old Dry Creek smelters
(Higgins, of Bawra, was connected with the
same works), went on to Kalgoorlie in its
early days, and was associated with Ilolroyd
in the first work done on tellurides. Little
luck, however, came his way, though he
travelled far and wide —he was at Cloncurry
and in New Guinea, among other places.
He had long been a valued Bulletin contri-
butor. Death came to him at 60.
Barham Black, a Scotchman who came to
Australia long ago, and married a daughter
of John Howard Clark, editor of Adelaide
“Register,” is dead in that city at 75. An
architect all his life, he did his biggest job
as his last, the T. and G: block in King
William-street, which gave Adelaide a new
skyline.
Dr. Douglas G. McKay, who returns from
England to become medical superintendent
and resident pathologist of the North Adel-
aide Children’s Hospital, was educated at
Prince Alfred College and Adelaide Uni.
He went overseas specially to study
diseases of children, and after securing his
M.R.C.S. was appointed house surgeon at
the Hospital for Sick Children, Great
Ormond-street, London; later he was resi-
dent surgeon at the Royal Manchester
Children’s Hospital. A keen cricketer, he
has represented South Australia in Sheffield
Shield matches, and played for Scotland.
Vic. Premier Argyle owns a citrus grove
at Lake Kangaroo, near Kerang, and works
it intensively, with his son as his deputy. So
when he went to Swan Hill the other day to
talk politics, he was hailed by Pye, acting-
president of the .shire, as a fellow-irriga-
tionist. Usually it suits iCockyites and
some of Argyle’s own crowd who represent
rural constituencies to make it appear that
the Premier is just a Collins-street X-ray
specialist with a home in Toorak; but he
has always had a hankering for the land.
His dad was a pastoralist at Ivyneton.
Vic’s new Agent-
General, R. LINTON.
All sorts of roads
lead up to an
Agent - General’s
office. Walter
Leitch, the man
who, after four
years of it, is
giving up the
Victorian job,
was a chemical
engineer, who
used to be gen-
eral manager for
the W elsbach
light and was the
C o mmonwealth’s
director of muni-
tions during the
war. That led.
him on to other
public job s —a
seat on the Tariff
Board in parti-
cular ; and from
that he passed on
to London. His
successor, Li n-
ton, established
the Big Brother
movement in the
days when we
were looking for
immigrants, and
that took him on
to the Vic.
Assembly. He
used to be man-
ager for Mid-
dows, the paper
and printing-
machinery merchants.
John Andrew Johnson, principal of Tas-
Teachers’ College for a quarter-century, who
had a big funeral in Hobart the other day.
was one of the most successful teachers of
teachers in the Commonwealth. In addition
to sound scholarship, wide experience and
passionate enthusiasm for his job, he pos-
sessed a speaking voice of that peculiarly
sympathetic, almost caressing, quality that
marks the speech of many Shetland and
Orkney Islanders. Though only nine years
old when he left the Shetlands his persuasive
intonation remained a lifelong asset.
John Charles Wright, Sydney’s late Arch-
bishop, was the son of a Lancashire vicar,
and a product of Manchester Grammar
School and Merton College, Oxford. His
rise in the church was fairly rapid, though
he put in his first eight years as a curate ; he
was Archdeacon of Manchester when he
accepted the call to much wider responsi-
bilities —he was consecrated to the see of
Archbishop WRIGHT.
Sydney at St. Paul’s, London, in 1909.
Although lie had little liking 'for the lime-
light, if not a positive distaste for it, it
has long been recognised that the Anglican
communion had in its Primate one of the
ablest administrators as well as the most
earnest of churchmen. The Archbishop, who
was in his 72nd year, died while on a holiday
in Maoriland.
The first bishop with jurisdiction over
Australia was Dr. Ileber, of Calcutta—-the
man who wrote “Prom Greenland’s Icy
Mountains” and dozens of other hymns. But,
though Australia was part of his beat, he
never came to it. The first Bishop of Sydney
was Broughton—with a seat in the nominee
Leg. Council. The R.C.’s had an archbishop
many years before the Anglicans.
Archbishop Wright remained an evan-
gelical ; but he grew more tolerant of many
things after he came to Sydney. “It was
Australia put this in my mouth,” he told
The Bulletin, tapping his pipe.
Chang Hsueh-liang, the Chinese marshal
who is bearing the brunt of the Japanese
attack, is not a patch on his late father, the
one-time ruler of Manchuria. It is the old
story of the successful business man who
hands a going concern over to his son.
Chang, senior, was a bandit in a small way
who gradually accumulated an army and
fought his way finally to the Mukden throne.
While he was in charge he preserved the
peace so well that he never gave the
Japanese a chance to offer their assistance.
He was killed by a bomb that blew up a
train on which he was travelling. The son
spent most of his time amidst the bright
lights of Peking, and Manchuria got rapidly
out of hand. The murder of a Japanese
officer was the spark that set the present
bonfire off.
Feng Yu-hsiang, the Chinese Christian
general, who is likely to figure in the struggle
for Jeliol, is over six feet in height and sports
that rarity in a Mongol, a perceptible but
somewhat scrubby beard. He was converted to
Christianity when, as a sentry at Paotingfu,
he saw Boxers massacring missionaries. H’e
quotes Oliver Cromwell in his army orders,
lets his private soldiers have first cut at his
treasury, and exacts a daily pledge from his
army that it will kill him if he ever attempts
to make himself emperor. At one time he
was death on Communists, but he has since
been to Moscow, and it is from there that
most of his munitions come. Since the Euro-
pean Powers put an arms embargo on them-
selves Russia has supplied most of the
sinews of war which keep Chinese generals
in their jobs.

Last year’s net result was 1.4 p.c. on capi-
tal as against 2.8 p.c. and 5.4 p.c. for the
two preceding terms; so reserves had to be
tapped for £3045 to pay 2i p.c. The trouble
lay in the milk section of the business;
the bread, butter, ice-cream and cold storage
departments all showed improvement. Under
the Lang Government’s Milk Act —a social-
istic piece of legislation which came into
operation early in the year—milk supplied
to the. metropolitan area is taken over by
the Milk Board at Is. Id. per gallon. It is
then distributed to retailers by the five cos.
concerned, including this one, at Is. sd. A
year ago the distributing cos. figured their
bare costs at -§d. more than the margin
allowed (4d.). Though the basic wage in
N. S. Wales was reduced towards the end
of last year, there is still little, if any, profit
in the business. The Milk Board has
declined to make any alteration in prices, or
to reinvestigate conditions in the industry.
Because oi these and other things a Royal
Commission is to inquire into the board’s
administration.
The co.’s profits have always been slender,
due mainly to competition. Since the
£73,384 was struck off capital in 1904 to
cover drought losses—it was restored by
the gifts of 1911 and 1913—divs., have aver-
aged a shade under 8J p.c. It is not that the
co. has been unable to get its full share of
business, but largely owing to price-cutting
it has got no benefit from extra trade. Since
1919 extensions to plant, etc., have added
£174,980 net to the book value of fixed
assets, and £129,295 has been tacked on to
the debt:—

Thus, at the close of last accounts, the
excess of liabilities over more or less liquids
was £28,165, or £1240 more than at the pre-
vious balance. The debentures, got in at
the end of 1927 to lighten the floating debt,
carry 7 p.c., less the statutory cut (22-J
p.c.) ; they mature at the end of Sept., 1934.
The market notes the moderate and irre-
gular earnings and the size of the debt, and
prices the pound shares at 10s. At that
figure the return is 5 p.c. on a 2i p.c. div.
basis.

*Two years, flncludes writing-down of properties, etc.
The year’s loss of £143,585 was due wholly
or mainly to the writing-down of proper-
ties and livestock to what is considered to
be their present values. The year’s actual
trading result was not disclosed. The
shrinkage in the book value of fixed assets
was £157*158. There was a “considerable”
loss on account of Tarbrax, which was
gripped by drought till May last; many of
the sheep had been put on the road, and a
large number, including the lambs dropped,
died, while the rest brought low prices.
Things were different on the cattle runs,
from which a record number of fats were
turned off; but again prices spoiled financial
results.
There is £325,579 of share capital in
218,330 ords. and 107.249 8 p.c. cum. prefs.
(the latter have not had a div. since Nov.,
1925), and £219.107 of the lot was unrepre-
sented by tangibles in the books at the end
of Dec. last. It has been decided, therefore,
to wipe out the whole of the ord. capital,
cancel the arrears of pref. divs., convert the
existing pref. shares into ords., and to
issue £70,000 worth of new 5 p.c. prefs. in
satisfaction of a debt to the Q.M.E. of a
like amount —the new prefs. will have the
right to advance with the ords. beyond 5 p.c.
All this, when complete, will leave paid
capital at £177,249 in 70,000 prefs. and
107,249 ords. An all-round 5 p.c. on £177,249
would call for £8862 p.a. Though the
co. has balanced on the wrong side for each
of the last seven years, hopes are that the
Ottawa agreement will lead to profits in the
future. Whether it was wise to entirely ex-
tinguish the whole of the ord. capital only the
future can tell. At least ordinary share-
holders are entitled to a deferred claim on
the. future ; it doesn’t matter much whether
their token of ownership is a penny or a
pound.
The position as balance-sheet figures show
it is as follows: —
IQ9Q IQ9O IQQI i qqo
Capital .. £269,659 £325,579 £325,579 £325,579

Debtors and cash 6,161 5,562 4,367 5,692
The grouping prevents a clear view of the
finances. Last year £12,297 was knocked off
the debt, which the funding of £70,000 com-
ing to the Q.M.E. will reduce to £140,376.

This offshoot of the big Goodyear Tyre and
Rubber Co., Akron (U.S.A.), continues to
give a very good account of itself. It set
up as recently as 1926, when, owing to press-
ure of the tariff, the parent decided to build
a factory here. Paid capital is £BOO,OOO
in half a million ords., all taken by the
parent for cash, and 300,000 8 p.c. cum.
prefs., which were snapped locally. The
co. stepped into a ready-made trade connec-
tion, developed by an importing agency, and,
with things right on the technical side, out-
put quickly doubled; more plant, etc., had
to be installed, and the parent advanced the
money (over half a million, at the end of
1930). With the machines running to capacity,
production costs were lowered, and, after
paying the pref. div., there was enough left
to show 21.2 p.c. on ord. capital in the
second year, and 45 p.c. in 1929.
But slump brought a sharp drop in the
demand for initial equipment and replace-
ment tyres, and the price of both raw
materials and the finished product continued
to fall, making stocks troublesome, while
exchange and primage bumped up landed
costs, and casualties in the motor and auxil-
iary trades kept the debts question acute.
Hence the abrupt contraction of the figures.
The trade looked up a little last year, especi-
ally during the Dee. half, and overhead was
got back a bit further. The profit claimed
was enough to pay the pref. div. and show
6.8 p.c. on ord. capital as against 2.4 p.c.
and 11.9 p.c. in the two preceding terms.
That was after the book value of fixed assets
had been reduced by £91,350, equal to 12.7
p.c. of their 1931 figure. The ords. were
handed 8 p.c., their first div., and £328,955
of reserves remained to support and assist
capital. It is, a creditable performance for
a six-year-old.
Unable to find employment for surplus
earnings in the business, the board lopped a
further £150,000 off the debt to the parent
last year:—

The growth in other liabilities and in the
stocks and book debts figures reflects the
improvement in trade towards the close of
accounts. The more or less liquid surplus
(£557,623, including stocks) was £125,370
stronger than at the close of accounts in
1931.
The prefs., which are covered by £3 15s. 3d
in net tangibles, return 6 p.C; at 265. 9d.
The co. has waived its rights in respect of
the 22$ P-c. statutory cut in the div., thus
ensuring that 8 p.c. instead of 6.2 p.c. is
actually paid.

This is now Australia’s largest building
society. After a rough passage in the ’nine-
ties it swept the fragments of seven other
Melbourne building concerns into its basket.
But development was slow until after the
war; then the business expanded vigorously,
and the growth was financed largely on bor-
rowed money. Under ordinary circumstances
this might have been expected to spell
trouble when conditions changed. But the
co.’s association with the National Mutual
Life, which is the largest shareholder and
also provides a large part of the deposits,
gives it a different standing from most
others, and policy-holders in the life office
gain something from the association, too.
The almost complete cessation of home-
building. cuts in interest rates, and sting-
ing increases in taxation, especially on
incomes from property, have brought profits
back with a jerk, of course. Gross earnings
have come down by annual steps from
£144,215 in 1928 to £106,991 last year, when
the slip was £18,964. „ Exes. (£72,344, in-
cluding taxation) were '£9014 lighter, leaving
the net result at 8.5 p.c. on the permanent
and temporary capital combined as against
11.3, 13.1, 18 and 18.1 p.c. back to 1928.
The div., which had been steady at 12 p.c.
for the seven years to the close of accounts
in 1930, was lowered a point to 8 p.c.
Since the close of accounts the co. reports
a steady increase in applications for loans.
This and prospects of a little relief in taxa-
tion give the 8 p.c. div. a more comfortable
appearance. Only £39,923 was put out on
fresh securities last year as against £284,724
in 1930 and £398,658 in 1925.
During the year the book value of ad-
vances was reduced £90.395, and £95,999
of deposits, etc., was repaid:—

No foreclosures figure in the accounts,
thanks to the moratorium, which has helped
to .steady the fall in property values. At the
close of accounts the book value of the assets
could shrink by over 40 p.c. before a penny
of outside money, including temporary capi-
tal, would be in danger.
The fully-paid £5 permanent shares are
priced at £6 ss. on the market. The return
at that figure is 6.4 p.c. on an 8 p.c. div.
basis. The net. tangible backing is £ll 3s. Bd.
per share. Since the co. pays the special
Federal tax of 2s. in the pound on income
from property, the dividend is not subject
to this impost.

♦Year’s loss debited to contingency reserve.
The losses are due mainly to bad debts.
The co. has wide connections in the coun-
try, and much of its funds are used in carry-
ing stocks for clients. Owing to the plight
of the farmer the small storekeeper has not
been able to meet the wholesaler’s bill in
full, while demand has been restricted to the
cheaper lines, carrying margins too narrow to
support costs, including the cost of distribu-
tion, on their present basis. Business improved
towards the close of last accounts, and gross
earnings (£66,368) advanced £5966. Exes.
(£82,842, including bad debts written off
and provided for) were £7582 lighter, leav-
ing the balance £16,474 on the wrong side.
This was made up of £5579 loss on trading,
£7672 struck off for bad debts and £3223
loss on maintenance of the Clarence and
Kent streets properties. The corresponding
figures for the previous year "were £8542,
£17,771 and £3708 respectively. The pro-
perties just referred to .were vacated early
in 1931. when operations w r ere concentrated
in an effort to reduce overhead. Last year’s
loss lowered what remained of the £69,070
set aside for contingencies in 1930 to £22,575.
This has now been deducted from the book
value of debtors’ balances in the sheet.
All this left the net book value of the
undertaking at the end of Dec. £75,000 ( =
6s. Sd. per share) short of paid capital, and
that amount is to be written off, reducing
the figure to £150,000. Here is the position
as balance-sheet figures show it: —

*After deducting contingency reserve, £22,575.
The contingency reserve and bad debts
written off account for all but £3856 of the
year’s contraction of £34,509 in debtors’
balances. Excluding investments, which re-
present the co.’s interest in Mitchell’s Fac-
tories, Ltd., and allowing for the contingency
reserve, the year’s shrinkage in the more
or less liquid surplus (£69,770) was £15,606.
David Mitchell founded the business in the
sixties of last century with money he had
made storekeeping at Ipswich (Q.). An
extensive importing trade was developed, but
the first Commonwealth tariff gave the co.
new opportunities, and it put in plant to
manufacture and pack drygoods. But there
was never much profit in the business; dur-
ing the 10 generally flush years to the close
of accounts in 1929, reserves were tapped
for £21,324 to pay divs. averaging 6.5 p.c.
Allowing for the reduction of capital by
6s. Bd. per share, the return at 4s. would be
6.6 p.c. on a 2 p.c. div. basis.

The standard div. was lowered from 8 p.c. to
6 p.c. under the Lang Government’s Gas and
Electricity Act, which came into force in
March last year; this Act also cut down the
allowance for depreciation, etc., from 3£ p.c.
to 3 p.c. of the capital outlay on buildings
and plant. Nevertheless, the market now-
prices the scrip at 235. 6d. as against 16s. 6d.
in the middle of 1931; it obviously considers
6 p.c. with Lang out worth more than 8 p.c.
with Lang in. The return at 235. 6d. is
5.1 p.c. on a 6 p.c. div. basis.
There was a welcome spring of over a
million cubic feet in the quantity of gas
sold (173.4 million cubic feet). But a cut
of 3d. per 1000 c.f. in the price charged to
the consumer, following the reduction of the
basic wage, left revenue from gas sales £IS66
lighter; all but £555 of the shrinkage was
offset by increased returns from residuals: —

The growth of £1163 in outgoings was due
mainly to the withdrawal of the Govern-
ment subsidy on coal, which added Is. 6d.
per ton to the price.
The full statutory allowance (£8118) was
made for depreciation, etc. The experience
over the last decade suggests that this wfill

STANDARD HIGH-GRADE MOTOR TYRE
CATERPILLAR TRACTION TREAD
ARMOURED WALL
HOW to minimise that main cause of tyre destruction —the
terrific heat generated by road friction —is a problem at
last mastered in the new Barnet Glass Tyre. . . . Heat is
reduced by a new scientific balance between stretch of
rubber and cords. . . . Heat is dissipated by the fan-blade action of
the buttressed side walls. These stout buttresses also provide an
effective armour for the casing, protecting it against curb cutting
and abrasion and preventing distortion. . . . The new Caterpillar
Traction Tread maintains positive road grip at all angles, ensures
direct driving without slip and perfect control when accelerating
or braking.

recognised in the Act, would, therefore, pro-
bably mean more share or loan capital, the
cost of which would, of course, be reflected
in the price charged to thp consumer.
Since 1923 expenditure on capital account
totals £196,991, an average of £19,699 p.a.
The amount spent last year was £4861. Re-
quirements for the next couple of years are
figured at £BOOO p.a., which will most likely
be raised by debentures or temporary loans.
Lustre Hosiery, Ltd. (Sydney)
Last week shareholders in this co. were
perplexed by a circular from the chairman,
Henry H. York. As holder of not less
than one-tenth of the issued capital of the
co., he has called an extraordinary general
meeting of shareholders, the board (there
are three other members) having failed to do
so on his (Mr. York’s) requisition. Resolu-
tions to be submitted to the meeting are, in
effect, that the action instituted against Mr.
York should be discontinued; that no further
proceedings be taken against Mr. York or
Henry H. York and Co., Ltd.; that the mat-
ters involved should be settled by arbitration.
This was followed by another circular,
issued by the other directors. It has made
the position clearer, but not less astonish-
ing. The action, it is said, was brought to
recover debts of over £BOOO, guaranteed by
Mr. York’s co., which had received full com-
mission in respect thereof from the Lustre
Co. Mr. York asked the Lustre Co. to fore-
go this amount; but the remaining directors
refused to apeede to this request. They state
that his (Mr. York’s) co. made very large
profits out of the Lustre Co. for many years,
and that Mr. York himself, under the new
arrangement, was receiving a salary of £4OOO
a year. They further add that the directors
have already intimated that they arc pre-
pared to have all matters between the Lustre
Co., Mr. York and Henry H. York and Co.
arbitrated upon.
There is £250,000 of share capital in 88,333
10 p.c. cum,, prefs. and 166,667 ords. At
the end of December last there was ss. per
share coming to the prefs. in divs., and the
ords. have been out of the picture since
1929. The accounts for 1932 are due any
time now. At the end of 1931 there was
£87,165 coming to outsiders; stocks
(£128,228), book debts (£95,371) and cash,
etc. (£1691), totalled £225,290. Fixed assets
figured at £182,130. Certainly discriminating
legislation in* N. S. Wales handicapped the
co. for a while; but the outlook has changed,
and efficient textile concerns ought to be able
to show reasonably good returns, provided,
of course, they are not hamstrung.
Cracow Goldfield
Dr. Loftus Hill, one-time director of the
Tasmanian Government Geological Survey,
has examined the Cracow (Q.) goldfield on
behalf of the Golden Mile and six other cos.
operating there. He says it possesses all
the essential characteristics of an important
goldfield.
The lode system has been proved for up-
wards of 15,000 ft. in length, with widths
varying from 20ft. to 300 ft., and thus far
the gold content varies from traces up to
21oz. per ton. The rich patches occur in
joint planes and minor fractures through-
out the field. These, however, should not be
confused with pay-shoots within the main
lode system. Sampling has disclosed two
grades of pay-shoots; the richer average
upwards of loz. per ton, and the second-
grade from sdwt. to Bdwt. per ton. To the
first type belong No. 1 shoot of Golden
Plateau, Warrego and Surprise shoots of the
Golden Mile, Surprise shoot of the Golden
Hill, B.D.L. shoot of the White Hope South
and the Accumulation shoot of Roma North.
The length of these shoots ranges from 20ft.
to 160 ft.; width from Ift. to 40ft.; vertical
depth has been proved to 160 ft. on Golden
Plateau. Average values range from 3oz. to
6oz. per ton over “appreciable dimensions.”
An important characteristic of the shoots is
their pronounced pitch. It is 30 degrees to
the west in Golden Plateau ; this, combined
with a southerly dip of 60 degrees, takes the
pay-shoot progressively south-westwards as
depth is gained.
Although the lode material is high-grade in
parts, other parts are clearly unpayable. The
task ahead is to explore the lode system and
define the pay-shoots.
World production of lead for 1932 is esti-
mated at 1,130,000 tons, or 249,000 tons less
than in 1931 and 600.000 tons below the
peak figure of 1929. Since July, 1932, sales
have kept slightly ahead of production. The
world output, of zinc for 1932 was 765,000
tons, or 231,000 tons below the 1931 figure,
and less than half that of 1929. Moreover,
since production was restricted to 45 p.c. of
plant capacity, stocks were considerably
reduced. Of all the non-ferrous base metals,
zinc appears to be in the best position to
follow any immediate improvement in world
trade.
* # * *
Raub, a Queensland concern operating the
only important goldmine in the F.M.S.,
seems certain of another highly profitable
year. During the last nine months of 1932
the co. won 18,5030z. f or 16760 z. more than
for the corresponding period of 1931. A
year or so ago the management decided to
re-treat an accumulation of mill tailings;
also, the new oil-fired plant for roasting
firsenopyrite concentrates was extended.
There is £200,000 of capital, on which divs.
of 20 p.c. and more have been paid of recent
years.

The Mt. Lyell Co. (Tas.) is rising a main
shaft from, the North Lyell tunnel to the
Royal Tharsis orebody, a distance of S6sft.
This type of shaft work, which is new to
Australia, costs less than the usual sinking.
When complete the shaft will greatly cheapen
thc_ extraction of an extra 2,475,000 tons of
2.25 p.c. copper ore.
* * * *
A magnetic geophysical survey of the
Tingha-Gilgai- tinfield (N.S.W.), carried out
by the Department of Mines, has located the
path of many of the main and tributary
deep leads. 1 Three areas are considered to be
worth testing by shaft-sinking to depths rang-
ing from 90ft. to 190 ft. These are the
middle portion of Topper’s Mountain lead,
between Schumanns and tlie Brickwood Ex-
tended, portions of the Oaks country, to the
east of the Tnverell-road, and the Gilgai deep
lead, above the Last Chance shaft.
* * * *
The syndicate which has taken over the
North Arm goldfield (Q.) is erecting 50 head
of stamps to treat surface ore. A Continen-
tal treatment plant, said to be new to Aus-
tralian mining, is expected to arrive from
overseas in about three months. A co. with
a capital of £125,000 is being formed pri-
vately. On the North Arm field a hill about
300 ft. high is the centre covering of a large
volcanic crater. To date 24 gold-bearing
reefs have been located in this hill. The
Golden Surprise tunnel has cut the lot, and
development has proved the maintenance of
values at depth.
* * * *
Many, of the old mines in the Eidsvold
(Q.) district are being opened up again.
The Augusta, a producer of 20 years ago,
has been taken by a local syndicate; the Lady
Rose, which closed down at the beginning of
this century, is being overhauled ; the Hollow
Tooth and the Eye Opener, both good pro-
ducers in the early days, are also receiving
attention; and a syndicate at work with
cyanide on the White Sand reports steady
profit. Gold was first discovered in the dis-
trict in 1888; to date over IOO.OOOoz. has
been won.
* * *
Chinaman’s Creek, about 15 miles from
Maleny (Q-), where much alluvial was won
about 50 years ago, is being prospected
again. About 800 tons of ore expected to
average over 2oz. awaits crushing; a battery
is to be erected.
* * * *
Over 1200 prospectors are at work in the
Bendigo district (Vic.). There are many
parties of two or more, and some good re-
turns are being won from the reefs and
spurs in the upper levels of old mines.
Alluvial fossicking is also on the increase.
During January the banks in. Bendigo bought
27000 z., compared with llOOoz. in January,
1931. Hercules was the principal contri-
butor with 1878 oz.
:;= * sp *
Rose, Thistle and Shamrock, Harrietville
(Vic.), got 2300 z. of gold from 225 tons
during January; the December figures were
3250 z. and 299 tons. Developments on the
800 ft. and IISOfL. levels, where a lot of loz.
stone is showing, have brightened the co.’s
prospects.
* * * sjt
There is considerable activity in the
Smythesdale district (Vic.). A co. has been
formed to reopen the Lorna Doone line of
reef, which is a continuation of the Stafford-
shire lode. A shaft on the German Consols
has proved 6ft. of payable stone, and a test
crushing is. being taken out. At Canico
Bdwt. material is being mined at a depth of
200 ft. from a reef 2ft. wide.
* * *
Maldon Gold Development appears to have
picked up a couple of duds in the New Chum
and South German at Maldon (Vic.). A
meeting is to be held to consider whether
the co. should give up the ghost.
* * * *
Tasmanian Asbestos, Beaconsfield (Tas.),
has added another 80 acres to its leases,
thereby doubling the quantity of asbestos-
bearing serpentine available for treatment.
To date 92 bags of asbestos have been
obtained by crushing and screening, and the
material has met with ready sale. Efforts
are being made to dispdse of the figured ser-
pentine as terrazo rock for ornamental work.
* * * *
In accordance with the Privy Council
judgment, Great Boulder (W.A.) is about
to pay its tributors 50 p.c. of the exchange
premium, plus 6 p.c. interest on accounts
to date. The co. has also agreed to pay
the royalty it deducted from the enhanced
sterling price of gold for the six months
to September, 1932. The extent, if any, to
which other cos. may be involved depends
upon the nature of the agreements entered
into. Thus Lake View and Star says that
it is not bound by the judgment. Some time
ago it offered its tributors 20 p.c. of the
exchange premium, 50 p.c. of the increased
sterling price and 50 p.c. of the bounty on
all gold produced by them. Some agreed,
but others refused.
* * * *
Beans allege that Lake View and Star
(W.A.) is scratching for enough ore to keep
its new flotation plant in full swing;
that the grade of ore being treated is lower
than the average claimed for the mine; that
costs have not come back so far as the man-
agement expected. Information from official
sources, however, discloses that there is no
difficulty in getting tonnage, and that the
quantity treated is to be gradually increased
until a maximum of 45,000 tons a month
is reached; all payable ore broken in the
course of development is being sent direct
to the mill; costs are above what they will
be, because portion of the old mill is treat-
ing stulf cleaned up around the mine and
not suitable for flotation. Recent develop-
ments at depth in the Lake View section
encourage the belief in official quarters that
a new mine is being opened up there.

An English syndicate has become inter-
ested in the banket deposits at Nullagine
(W.A.), and a representative from London
is inspecting the field. These deposits, which
cover a large area, have been worked ex-
tensively in the past; they consist mostly of
conglomerate sediments 300 ft. thick, and in
some respects resemble the famous Rand
banket formations. Most of the gold-bearing
sections are impregnated with' oxides of iron
and sulphides, and lie between a well-marked
fault and a greenstone dyke. Development
would cnll for big-scale operations and a
substantial capital.

Owing to the high price of gold in terms
of paper, many tailings dumps, once worth-
less, have now become valuable. One of
250.000 tons at Lakeside, near Boulder, is
to be treated by a syndicate headed by
George Ridgway. It contains the residues
from the first Boulder Perseverance plant,
which Zeb Lane installed on the edge of
Hannan’s Lake, then partially covered with
salt brine.

Phoenix Gold Mines, an Adelaide concern,
has taken a 12 months’ working option over
the much-examined Mararoa at Norseman
(W.A.). The Mararoa has been worked
over a length of 2800 ft. and to a depth of
960 ft., the bulk of the ore being won between
240 ft. and 440 ft. Several bores were put
down in 1929 by the Westralian Government;
one showed sft. of 40s. stone at 620 ft.
Near by is the Viking, which has yielded
about 130,000 tons of 14dwt. stuff, and the
New Mararoa.
* * * *
Westralian Gold Development has taken
an option over the Mount Morgans (W.A.).
In the past this mine yielded 360,000 fine
ounces of gold from 791.000' tons. The lode
averaged sft. in width, but values fell away
below 300 ft. In 1929 the State Mining
Engineer reported favorably on the field, and
recommended test-boring the country east of
the main lode, and south along it.

Trewartha James, Dick Hamilton and
Jack Warwick have all recommended Great
Boulder to put in a new treatment plant in

Claude de Bernales has formed a co. in
London to take over and develop several
Westralian gold mines recommended by
Harry Urquhart. These shows yielded a lot
of wealth in the past, and deeper mining is

extraction.

Freney Oil has struck trouble again.
Boring has had to be suspended at 1545 ft.
because a number of tools, “almost impos-

Roan Antelope, one of the larger Rho-
desian copper-mines, is producing blister at
a cost of £23 (sterling) per ton, compared
with original estimates of £35 per ton. The
cost of mining is 3s. 6d. per ton, and milling
Is. 6d. per ton. The milling cost is said
to be the lowest on record for a similar plant.
The co. treats 3,500,000 tons per annum.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
What is meant by a floating charge over
a co.’s assets? —4589.
It is a means by which some or all of a
co.’s assets are mortgaged, but in such a
way that the mortgagor can deal with them
without the concurrence of the mortgagee;
unless, of course, some event occurs which
crystallises the floating into a fixed charge.
A floating charge is usually given over the
circulating assets, such as book debts, stocks,
etc., and a fixed charge over the freehold
and other fixed assets.
What has been the petroleum output of
the various countries over the last four
years? —4s9o.
The yields of each country in millions of
barrels of 42 U.S. gallons each were:—
1932. 1931. 1930. 1929.
United 'States . . 789 8.10 898 1007
Russia . . . . 154 162 126 99
Venezuela . . .. 123 119 137 137
Persia . . .. 45 44 46 42
Rumania . . .. 45 48 42 35
Dutch E. Indies 37 36 42 39
Mexico . . 32 33 40 45
Others . . 75 78 79 82
Total . . . . 1300' 1370 1410 1486
Thus the greatest decline in output has been
in the U.S.A. Russia is now the second-
largest producer; it has many potential oil-
bearing areas untested.

BUSINESS, ROBBERY, ETC.
Out on the Murrumbidgee irrigation area
(N.S.W.) recently there were still nearly
40,000 cases of oranges awaiting sale and
shipment. They should all have been cleared
out; but the Australian and Maoriland Gov-
ernments began playing a stupid little game
of cut-throat. Maoriland wanted to send
its apples and potatoes to Australia; but,
because if grows apples and potatoes of its
own, Australia said, not that it didn’t want
these “foreign” goods, but that they were
afflicted with housemaid’s knee or some other
esoteric disease; and in reply Maoriland dis-
covered that Australian oranges were all
Bolsheviks, and therefoi-e dangerous immi-
grants. So there the matter stands, each
facing the other behind a barricade of sub-
terfuges.

Some of these trade unions don’t give
much help to people who plan and scheme
to provide more work. Three months ago
the Bulletin Co. joined in with a couple
of enthusiasts who wanted to publish books
in Australia. The question soon arose, in
regard to some of the processes, whether the
work should be done by hand or by machine.
Inquiries showed that one job would cost
about 33$ per cent, more if done by hand,
but that about six times as many people
would be employed. The men who run
the Bulletin Co. did not hesitate —“cut
the machine out and give work to these
extra people,” they said. A start was made
with this particular operation, and then the
union bosses arrived from the Trades Hall.
“You can’t do that,” they said. “This is a
tradesman’s job.” So the factory hands
were dismissed, and the work was given to a
machine, with a union operative in charge of
it.

Dear Buixetin, —One of our wealthy in-
surance offices has been proclaiming that,
provided the Government agrees not to tax
the interest on mortgages over land, it will
reduce the interest charged for those mort-
gages. I am only a humble trader, but if
the Government will agree not to charge me
sales tax, primage duty, Customs duty,
excise and all the many other forms of taxa-
tion, I in my turn will sell to my customers
goods less the sums now paid. It should be
apparent to the management of this insur-
ance office that we all would gladly reduce
our prices if the Government gave a lead
by reducing taxation; moreover, it appears
certain that such a step must be taken. —
Yours faithfully, Ex Uno.

“Man of Kent” (Canterbury, Eng.) : In
the Commons a few nights ago Captain Heil-
gers asked the President of the Board of
Trade whether imports of eggs from Aus-
tralia had been increasing, and why. Dr.
Burgin replied that “imports in shell during
the three months September to November
amounted to 897,194 great hundreds, as com-
pared with 461,736 and 324,274 great hun-
dreds respectively in the corresponding
periods of 1931 and 1930.” He didn’t
answer the other question—why imports had
increased. But to one who had been in the
produce trade in Australia before settling
in this country the reason is plain—organ-
isation of producers. The Australian egg
has a good name on this market, and, in
view of the large possibilities, I do urge
upon export authorities to see that nothing
is done or left undone to prejudice the pros-
pects of the trade.

“Billabong”: City people surely don’t
realise how much writing down will have
to be done. A case was mentioned in a
N.S.W. back-country court recently. A man
who bought a property in 1924 for £30,000 had
borrowed £41,000 on it. H'e owed over £4OOO
for interest. Another firm had advanced
£26,000 on his stock, and he owed them
£9OOO for interest. His total liabilities had
reached £71,000; and I doubt whether the
property is worth two-thirds of the £30,000
he contracted to pay for it in 1924.

Reduction of interest rates on bank de-
posits gives a fillip to industry in all sorts
of unexpected places. Lately the director
of the Macleod Gallery was rejoiced to note
a large increase in picture sales. One buyer
explained it. He wasn’t able to save much ;
but what he did save he had always put
into deposits. But 2 p.c. offered no attrac-
tions ; he decided that he would rather buy
something he could get pleasure from look-
ing at, and which he was reasonably assured
he could sell without capital loss when he
wanted the money. And he confesses that
he also got a lot of pleasure out of learning
what to buy.

“Kariah”: The canning factory estab-
lished by oyster farmer’s, at Port Stephens
(N.S.W.) has got its attractively-packed pro-
duct on the market and is now turning its
attention to smoked mullet and tomato
sauce. Slightly larger than the English
kipper, the flat-tail mullet, which, although
possessing first-class table properties, is un-
saleable in the ordinary market, abounds in
Port Stephens, and should give the factory
a satisfactory .supply of raw material.

The Murray Island Fisheries, Ltd., which
commenced about six months back at the
Murray Islands, in Torres Strait (right up
at the head of the Great Barrier Reef), to
salt and sun-dry sardines for the East Indies,
has ceased operations “temporarily.” Low
prices caused by the depression in “the
East’’ is said to be the cause. One thing
remains to rejoice over—there was never
at any time a scarcity of the sardines.

One grower in the Stanthorpe district
(Q.) buried 300 cases of plums the other
day because the ruling price of Is. per case
would have left him much out of pocket had
he consigned the fruit to the markets. This
waste of fruit i.s appalling; and surely some-
thing can be done to make it unnecessary.

“Henry Bateson” : A southern Maoriland
concern wrote down all its country mort-
gages by 25 p.c. 12 months ago. The cocky’s
current interest and principal payments are
on 75 p.c. of his mortgage, and if at the
expiration of five years his position is no
better arid world prices haven’t recovered
to a profitable basis, the co. bears the whole
loss. If things are better, the 25 p.c. cut
is restored, and he pays again on 100 p.c.

“G.D.M.”: In 1893 in Victoria there was
a seepage of money from the banks. G. D.
Carter, a whisky merchant, was Treasurer,
and conceived the fantastic idea of giving
the banks a compulsory holiday. Before
doing so he asked advice from John Sawers,
then superintendent of the Bank of Aus-
tralasia, who told him it would destroy con-
fidence to close for even one day. But
Carter knew 'best, and a “Government
Gazette” was issued declaring Monday, May
1, 1893, and the three following days holidays.
Three banks closed down, and only reopened
to reconstruct; the ’Asia,. the Wales and
the Union defied the Government and kept
open. Governor Comstock, of Michigan
(U.S.A.), has effectually destroyed his State
financially for the time being by proclaim-
ing an eight days’ holiday for 550 banks and
trust cos. Most of them will never reopen.
Illinois will probably be the next big State
to go, and Chicago, its capital, will be cleaned
up.

“Valeria”: Here is another of those cases
which are increasing the tribe of Bolshies.
A father and mother died leaving a large
family and a farm plastered with a first and
second mortgage. For the benefit of the
children their uncle at his own expense
cropped 400 acres and fallowed another 400;
the mortgagees gave him permission to do
the work. Before the crop was ready for
harvesting the first mortgagee got an order
from the Court to take over the property,
the second mortgagee went into possession,
and the children were scattered. The return
from the crop was sufficient to pay a year’s
interest, leaving a surplus for the working
of the farm ; the uncle got nothing for his
labor and seed, etc.

“Kariah”: Even concrete wharfing piles
are not immune from the action of pests.
The boring whelk, a tiny shellfish about a
quarter on an inch long, could, by means of
a secretion of hydrochloric acid, reduce these
apparently impregnable structures to totter-
ing wrecks if he was left long enough on
the job.
“Tanta-Tyga”: In the district in which
I live is a man who, tiring of business, some
years ago went; on to a scrub block, planted
a fruit and vegetable garden, selling the sur-
plus ; runs a few cows and supplies the
butter factory; a few fowls supply the
house, and surplus eggs help to buy neces-
saries from the grocers. Some time ago he
put out his foot, asking “Plow much did
the boots cost?” “Threepence,” was the
guess, and it was well within the mark. He
had made the last from native timber, raised
the beast, tanned the hide and made the
boots, and all the material purchased was
the hemp and eyelets. Few in the district
have felt the depression less, and none are
healthier and happier.

The keenness of the competition between
machinery devices and manual employment
in production was demonstrated again a few
days ago when at a meeting of the Rope
and Cordage Union bitter resentment was
expressed at a recent innovation in a Mel-
bourne factory—the placing of mirrors so
that each girl can watch two machines. Also
at a device that indicates to the overseer
when a machine stops.

“El Verdugo”: Though the N.S.W. Trans-
port Commissioners have adopted trolley
’buses as part of their transport scheme, I
doubt whether they appreciate the full sig-
nificance of what they have done. There is
no bettor system for feeder-freight purposes.
The problem with all electricity enterprises
is that of every other type of machinery
enterprise—of producing at a maximum capa-
city for a maximum number of hours. In
electrical enterprises it generally happens
that there are long periods when the plant
earns little or nothing. If the generators
could be kept at full-capacity production dur-
ing these hours, current being used for
freight haulage, the result should be a sub-
stantial reduction in the cost of transport.
The system is especially adaptable in coun-
try where there are steep hauls.

New England, North and North-West
Producers’ Co., formed to sell wool at New-
castle (N.S.W.), is making progress, in spite
of the obstacles thrown in its way. For the
year to June, 1930, it sold 84,255 head of
fat stock and 14,458 bales wool; for its last
year (to June, 1932) it sold 99,862 head
and 16,736 bales. The co. has shortened its
clumsy name to Nenco for trade purposes.

“F.” : Many English buyers are much in-
terested in Queensland’s timbers, but are
unable to get supplies when they want them.
Other countries, especially America and
Russia, send their timbers to London for
sale, instead of sending sample collections.
All that a buyer has to do is to ring for
what he wants, whereas he must wait many
months for any Queensland timbers that may
take his fancy. Most English buyers seem
to be keenly desirous of pushing Empire in
preference to foreign timbers. But we give
them very little help at our end.

To' show what the devaluation of the
South African pound to approximately the
level of sterling means to the Jewburg gold-
mining industry, take Randfontein Estates,
one of the largest medium-grade producers,
as an example. In November last it turned
out £292,000 worth of gold for a profit of
ss. sd. (S’African currency) from ore yield-
ing only 245. 4d. per ton at the par price of
gold. In sterling the same ore would at
present yield over 355. per ton. and the dif-
ference of around 11s. would be nearly all
extra profit. There would thus be a reason-
able margin to provide for threatened extra
taxation, and probably increased wages, and
yet leave the co. more than double as much
profit as of late. Robert Kotze, former
South African Government mining engineer,
recently “conservatively estimated'’ what
the Rand would gain from devaluation of
the South African pound. His calculation
was that a premium of 20 p.c. (17s. per
ounce) on gold would increase the total out-
put of the existing mines from £469,000,000
to £690,000,000.

In the development of farming the bug-
hunter demands a place alongside the chemist
and the engineer. In an address the other
day G. D. Ross, permanent head of the
N.S.W. Department of Agriculture, said that
already 80 p.c. of the prickly-pear in Queens-
land had been destroyed by cactoblastis and
50 to 60 p.c. in N. S. Wales. The curse
had been spreading at the, rate of a million
acres a year when the little bug was intro-
duced to it. Already in Queensland alone
1,250,000 acres of abandoned pear country
has been „ re-selected for farming and
1,750,000 acres for grazing; and cacto. is
still steadily on the job.

A romance in oils :
An iron tank, the first vacuum petroleum still
and the first still that suecesijjfuik’y obtained lubri-
cating oil from crude petroleum on a commercial
basis, has been presented by the Vacuum Oil Co.
to Henry Ford for the Edison Institute’s collection.
The tank had a capacity of 30 barrels per day, and
the oil was put into second-hand oyster cans. It
will be restored to its original working order in
the Edison Institute by men who used to run it
before it was dismantled.
The progress of the mineral-oil distilling busi-
ness has been one of the amazing things of the
past half-century. It was in 1865 that the Vacuum
Oil Co. was founded, and it was soon selling three
products in its own territory. To-day it i?
selling in 230,000 towns in practically every country
of the world, and it markets 250 products. Inci-
dentally, Vacuum Oil was the first oil co. to com-
mence business in Australia. That was in February,
1895, when the staff of three was housed in an
office in Queen-street, Melbourne. The co. in those
days handled a dozen grades of lubricating oil and
two types of lubricators, and had to prove to
engineers and others that mineral oils did their
job better than the tallow and castor oil then in
use. The first order booked was a barrel of 600 W
cylinder oil for a gold-mining co. at Eaglehawk.
The marketing of motor spirit did not begin until
the beginning of this century. Bulk distribution
commenced early in 1924, and in eight years this
one co. spent £5,000,000 in perfecting its dis-
tributing plant and organisation. The manufacture
of oils in Australia commenced in 1907, when the
co. erected compounding and blending tanks at
Sydney. Plants to do the job are now provided in
every State, and almost every year more grades are
manufactured in this country.

In a week in whieli stage shows in Sydney
were as scarce as snowflakes in Pitt-street,
and on a morning to which both summer
and autumn contributed their choicest gifts,
the Sundry Showman and Frith suddenly
"Locked!” it moaned. “Always locked!”
bethought themselves of the city’s biggest
ancl best show, whose record of continuous
performances makes “Chu Chin Chow”
look like a one-night stand. So they'crossed
the harbor in the stout steam packet Boom-
erang, or some such name, and, after making
donations to the Trustees of the Taronga
Zoo, spent a couple of hours in communion
with the carnivora, the herbivora and the
creatures that will cat almost anything.
Frith, to whom the inspection of poor cap-
tives is a solemn joy, carried paper bags
containing (1) buns, (2) hazel nuts, (3)
apples. The larger members of the animal
kingdom were not expecting visitors so early
in the day, and it was a little difficult to
convince them that they ought to start work.
The orang-outang, who is both fat and lazy,
lay on his side day-dreaming. When a nut
hit him on the nose he grabbed it with
unexpected alertness, smelt it, bounced it,
and then threw it back. “Youse blokes,”
he whined, “ain’t got no sense of what’s fit.
Them nuts is too small to be worth crackin’.
Bring* me Brazil nuts and I’ll do me wooden-
ball act.” So the visitors moved on to the
chimpanzee. The chimp., a melancholy
creature, accepted an apple and ate it
tragically. “Haven’t got a file in your
pocket, have you?” it asked in a husky
whisper. “Didn’t know you ate ’em,”
responded Frith. “I don’t,” said the
chimp., “but till I get a file I can’t escape
and roam the forest wide. Hist' My
gaoler approaches.” Saying which the
chimp, nimbly climbed to the ceiling of his
apartment. His gaoler entered with a kero-
sene tin, a pannikin, and a small piece of
twig*. “Come down and have a nice drinkie-
drinkie,” he cooed. The chimp, affected to
tremble with terror. The gaoler waved the
twig mildly, and the chimp, climbed down
inch by inch. Once he got down, however,
he tucked into the water manfully, drinking
pannikinful after pannikinful, and asked
for more. “You’ve had quite enough,” said
his gaoler unfeelingly. “Mustn’t make a
beast of yourself.” And he slipped out of
the cell. The chimp, waited till the man
was outside, then tiptoed to the door and
shook it gently. “Docked!” it moaned.
‘ Always locked. But some day he’ll
forget.”
Leaving the chimpanzee immersed in his
woes, the visitors stood before the villa
inhabited by Mrs. Felis Leo and her two
charming daughters. “I should have brought
some liver,” murmured Frith apologetically.
“Not at all necessary,” purred Mrs. Felis.
“For myself, I don’t mind, but irregular
meals are bad for growing girls. Susie,
dear, stop blinking. It makes me nervous.
Observe your sister. Poise. Deportment.
No fidgeting. Yow take after your father.”
“Put his head in a corner and started to
eat lucerne."
Susie yawned. “Anyway, ma,” she observed
wearily, “I don’t squint.” Topaz lightning
shone from the eyes of Mrs. Felis, and
Frith gallantly averted a family jar. “Really,
Mrs. Felis,” he said, “if you hadn’t told us
we shouldn’t have known that these charm-
ing young ladies were not your sisters.” A
trio of purrs showed that the compliment
had achieved its purpo.se.
The hippopotami, who were next encoun-
tered, were having their pool cleaned out,
and were both in a bad temper. The old ’un’s
enormous visage was dimly visible through
a. large iron grating. “Hurry up with my
bath, Jeames,” he grunted to an attendant
who was busy with a hose, “and tell those
visitors to hop it. I’m not at home.” The
r' U - I< u r 0 -.’ a £ter one backward glance at
h nth, put his head in a corner and started
to eat lucerne. “After what The Bulletin
said about me in 1896,” he said indistinctly,
between mouthfuls, “I refuse to allow my
features to appear in its pages. Go and
draw the other animals. They may be glad
°£ vi ® hmelight.” “If it comes to that,”
said Frith, “your stern is quite as present-
able as your bow.” “Go !” grunted the junior
hippo, in tones of thunder. “Go before I
forget that I am a gentleman.”
The giraffes, who had overheard this little
encounter, were giggling. The tallest, who
was chewmg a straw and getting no end
of tun out of chasing it all around her
tongue, posed in the doorway of her mansion
as I nth produced his sketchbook. “I’ll stand
just here,” said she coyly. “The background
makes me look slimmer.” “Madam,” said
1 nth jocularly, “if you were any slimmer I
couldn’t draw you at all.” The other giraffe
suddenly guffawed. Miss Giraffe looked dis-
pleased. “My nephew,” she said icily, “has
strange notions of humor.”
The elephant had a distrait air, and was
searching here,, there and everywhere on the
ground with its trunk. “I suppose you
haven t seen a thrippence?” it asked
anxiously. “I had it quite safe yesterday,
but I appear to have lost it. The last time
I lost thrippence I didn’t find it for 14
years. But. of course, patience and per-
severance will accomplish anything.” “I’ll
give you thrippence,”. said Frith. “No,” saidt
the elephant. “Thank you all the ,sam.e.
It mn t the money. It’s the principle of the
thing. It went on searching sedulously.
Obviously there was nothing to be gained
by continuing the conversation. Mr. and
Mrs. Felis Tigris, enjoying the morning air
on a shady verandah of their home, looked
upon the outer world with quiet, dignified
benevolence. Mr. F. T. rose, yawned,
strolled to the end of the verandah and
looked back at his wife. She had suddenly
orouclied and tensed her.'mightv rippling
muscles. Her earnest gaze was fixed on a
sweet little girl of some five summers, a
little airy fairy in muslin, gazing at the
tigress with solemn, wondering "eyes. Some-
thing very like a wink agitated the left eye
of Mr. Tigris. “The tableau',” he observed
to Frith, “represents ‘Yearning.’ ”
Chummiest of all the creatures- proved to
be Squizzy the Seal. He’s getting old and
fat and wheezy, but he dearly loves a' yarn.
In a discussion with Frith concerning the
Manchurian situation, he showed himself
strongly anti-Japanese. Apparently lie had
heard of the sealing activities of the men
of _ Nippon. Also he endeavored to enlist
Frith and the Showman as proponents of
a movement for giving all the smaller in-
habitants of the aquarium a weekly holiday
“I’ll stand just here,” said she coyly.
in the seal pool. The polar bear, it appears,
is the president of a very influential society
interested in this great reform. Frith lias
promised to do what he can.
What was intended to be a very brief visit
to the aquarium, undertaken by Frith with
the idea that it might enable him to present
a sort of Lord Lyttonisli report on Squizzy’s
fish-holiday notion, spun itself out. The
tropical fish were the reason. How Mother
Nature can provide fishes with suits of such
gorgeous and extraordinary coloring with no
more pigmentary aid than exists in proto-
plasm is one of those things a fellow can’t
even begin to understand, no matter how
much science he has swotted. Enchanting,
too, are the octopodes. One fellow per-
formed, for the benefit of the visitors, a
graceful dance. From end to end of his
long apartment he paced with measured
steps, his wreathing tentacles forming con-
tinuously a series of beautiful draped curves.
Never was a scarf-dancer or skirt-dancer
who could .compete with the perfect tech-
nique of this deep-sea ballerina.
In the big central pool of the aquarium
giant sharks glided like shadows, and rip-
pling the waters slightly there suddenly arose
what looked like a piece of richly-figured but
very tattered cretonne, in shades of brown"
It is labelled by the fisliologists a Port
Jackson Carpet Shark, but its real names
are “incredible” and “wonderful.” Skipper,
the grey-nurse shark, however, considers
carpet sharks unnecessary, and said so
“You can,” she said, “tell the public of
Sydney, from me, that I greatly admire their
harbor. And I wish to the Lord I’d never
left it.” On that note of wistful candor the
interviews ended.
The Seyler-Hannen co. at Melb. King’s
presents “Cynara,” much beloved of the
Repertorians. The drama belongs to the
“Back to the Horse” movement. It is in
three acts and eleven scenes, which involve
a tremendous carting to and fro of stage
furniture. This would not matter if the
cartage facilitated any outstanding and pro-
found portrayal of human emotions. But it
doesn’t. The events leading up to and sub-
sequent to the suicide by salts of lemon of
the . shopgirl Doris Lea, who has become
entangled with Jim Warlock, eminent Lon-
don lawyer, are detailed much in the same
way as a court reporter for the more sen-
sational sort of newspaper would set them
out. There is a prologue which anticipates
the proceedings that follow. Then we see
the lawyer, egged on by a libidinous
acquaintance, overcoming his shyness > and
picking up his .shopgirl in a Soho restaurant.
We see him getting further acquainted when
he opens public baths in a scene which exhi-
bits sundry Bright Young Things of Mel-
bourne society giving a mannequin show of
bathing costumes. We see him taking her
home to her flat after a day at the Derby.
We are fully aware by this time that an
affair is in progress, but to clinch the im-
pression a further chapter from the ancient
and well-thumbed Book of Seduction is en-
acted in the garden of a country inn near
London. Even the date is not omitted —
June 29. On July 5 the lawyer’s wife
returns from a holiday on the Continent,
and we are given a precise account of what
happened in the wife’s -bedroom, including
a ring on the ’phone from the now-abandoned
shopgirl. On July 7 the lawyer meets the
“I suppose you haven’t seen a thrippence?”
girl in Kensington - Gardens, and tells her
all is oyer between them, and on the even-
ing of the 10th a police "constable is admitted
to, Mr. Warlock’s library and informs him
and his wife and friend that the girl has
committed suicide. It would have been in
keeping with the rest of it for the play-
wrights to here present us with a view of
the body, but they make an unexpected leap
to July 12 and the coroner’s court in North
London. _ The whole play could have been
enacted in this codrt if the playwrights had
been as workmanlike as the author of “The
Trial of Mary Dugan.” The coroner brings
in the usual verdict, condemning the law-
yer’s behavior in a rider which fades into
the_ accents of the lawyer telling his wife
the whole story in a private hotel suite in
Capri, which brings us back to the samfe
August _ afternoon as the prologue. The
lawyer is ruined, the wife forgives, and they
decide to start life all over again.
Apart from its awkward structure the
play does not reveal much of the springs
of human behavior. The characters are all
what is called natural, but characters who
act “naturally” on the stage are acting the
conventions about their emotions—not the
emotions themselves. Conventional behavior
is a perfectly proper subject for art, but
only as conventional behavior, not as emo-
tion. It requires an artist to reveal to us
what the real emotions are behind conven-
tional behavior. It would have been inter-
esting to know what the girl felt about the
man, what the man felt about the girl, and
what the wife felt about both of them, but
that wouldn’t have been very easy to handle.
Nicholas Hannen is impressive in Act I.
Scene 1 only ; in the rest the extinguisher of
melodrama falls on him. The same may be
said of Athene Seyler as the wife. Cecily
Clarence makes a wistful shopgirl, and
Maureen O’Moor gives touches of natural
woman to her flatmate. John Longden pre-
sents an incredible coroner, and the lesser
parts are mainlv far^'cal.
# *
Nellie Bramley’s star turn Qf her extra-
ordinary season in Melbourne is .her per-
formance of Mrs. Worthley in Somerset
Maugham’s “Mrs. Dot,” this week occupying
the Palace. The play looks like a work of
the author’s dramatic adolescence. It is a
machine-made comedy of the ‘conventions,
well-served, however, with the Maugham wit
and _ with flashes of social satire. It is
Nellie’s share of the proceedings that in-
terests. As the brewer’s daughter who fights
all-comers for the heart and hand of a peer
of the realm she reveals an understanding ol
character considerably above that demanded
of her in her customary Pollyanna parts. It
is the fashion amongst most modern comedi-
ennes to affect a style of acting apparently
inspired by the slow-motion picture. Mar-
garet Rawlings, for instance, rushes through
emotional passages with the breathless speed
of a garden slug pursuing a lettuce to its
doom. Nellie rips into her longest speeches
at a rate that makes an account of Malcolm
Campbell’s latest drive read like a funeral
oration. She accompanies her words with
instantaneous selections from an apparently
inexhaustible arsenal of gestures and ex-
pressions, and these aids to emotion go off
continuously like an ammunition dump ex-
ploding by spontaneous combustion. The
effect is good. It is of something felt, not
of a lesson learnt by rote. By comparison,
even the capable members of her cast look
as easy in their parts as fish on a jetty, and
Alfred Frith’s face, no mean speed indicator
itself, degenerates into a mere cigarette-
holder. If the theatre were in a healthier
state Nellie would be able to make a living
in better vehicles than “Tilly of Blooms-
bury,” her next opus.

Sydney Howard’s problem-play “The
Silver Cord” is in danger of becoming a
favorite war-horse of Sydney amateurs. It
was done twice by the Fittonites, and on
Saturday Scott Alexander’s tribe had a slash
at it. Joan Sotheran found tlie part of the
mother 100 per cent, congenial. Dorothy
Purdy, as the wife of the eider son, was not
always on speaking terms with her stage
self, but managed to give a fair performance.
Sheila MacDougall was convincing as the
younger son’s fiancee. Harry Farrell and
Hugh Carlsson failed to distinguish them-
selves as the two sons.

The Showman paid a call by invitation on
the motor-ship Wanganella at Melb. docks
last week. She is the latest triumph of
naval architecture, is the largest ship on
the Australian register and belongs to the
lluddart Parker line. The ship has a divan
in its first-class smokeroom which cost £lO5,
and the whole floating seraglio blew a com-
plete hole in £520,000. The next new ship
brought out by an Australian shipping co.
will probably have an anchor of old Roman
bronze, relieved with gold Persian filigree,
and holds upholstered in Bayeux tapestry.
Its smokestacks will be exact models of the
Taj Mahal and its bilge will be filled with
Eau de Cologne. Its decks will be swabbed
down daily with Australian burgundy, unless
they are covered with Brussels carpets, in
which case they will be vacuum-cleaned by
hordes of housemaids in aprons of genuine
Spanish lace.
.The cabins on the Wanganella are so cun-
ningly arranged that all of them have port-
holes except one. On the next ship there
won’t be any cabins at all. The whole
vessel will be built like a garden suburb
with detached villas, pubs, churches, schools,
cinemas, garages and golf courses, so that
passengers will literally, instead of meta-
phorically, feel at home.
The Wanganella has an orchestra whose
music is conveyed by amplifiers to every part
of the ship. There is practically no chance
of the £165 divan ever serving as a couch
for Davy Jones because there is an elec-
trico-photographic device imbedded in the
keel which literally keeps an unwinking eye
on the bottom of the ocean and informs Cap-
tain Bates when it is getting too near. It
cost £14,000.

Sydney Corn’s first orchestral concert this
year will be Wagnerian, “The Flying Dutch-
man,” “Tannhauser,” “Lohengrin,” “Gotter-
dammerung” and “Meistersinger” being
drawn upon, supplemented by an operatic
performance of the whole of the first act of
“Tristan and Isolde,” with Madame
Goossens-Viceroy as Isolde. This being the
centenary year of the birth of Johannes
Brahms there will be a rendition of his
works in April—“ Tragic” overture, Fourth
Symphony, Second Concerto (Isidor Good-
man at the piano) and Songs for
Women’s Voices (Op. 17), accompanied by
two horns and a harp. The Con. Quartet
will give Brahms a place on its March pro-
gramme, and every place in its May selec-
tion. The Quartet proposes during the year
to make Sydney acquainted with some
hitherto-unheard works of Vaughan Wil-
liams, Bruckner and Hugo Wolf.
About 50,000 people attended the opening
concert of the Melb. Symphony Orchestra
in the Botanic Gardens. An unbiassed im-
pression is that the music was the least
important part of the proceedings. It was
an exquisite day. The orchestra played the
first movement of the “New World” 'sym-
phony of Dvorak, but Director Rae’s beauti-
fully kept lawns sweeping around the shrub-
beries were more majestic by far. The “Shep-
herds’ Hey” and “Mock Morris. Dance” of
Grainger were jolly enough, hut the frocks
of the ladies were unbelievably gay. Men-
delssohn’s “Midsummer Night’s Dream”
music may sound real enough in a concert
hall; it seemed trite when heard under
a sky of ineffable blue barred with drifting
white cloud. And the foliage of the mighty
trees, tossed by the light breeze, showed more
variety than the “Praeludium” of Jarne-
felt, which, owing to the loud-speakers, could
be heard coming from two places at once.
There were other distractions. The birds
sang, and the feet scraped on the asphalt
path leading up to the spot where the players
were installed. The Showman did get as far
as enjoying the opening bars of the introduc-
tion to the third act of “Lohengrin,” but
just then a reunion' of Kyneton residents
occurred in his immediate vicinity. He
“He dearly loves a yarn."
learnt more about Kyneton before the intro-
duction was finished than he ever knew
before. Mrs. Jones had had twins, boy and
girl, and Mrs. Smith had lost her cow
or her husband or her cow of a husband
(it wasn’t clear which), and the pub had
changed hands twice. After all, bringing
music to the people has its advantages. Who-
ever would have thought Kyneton was such
an exciting place?
“L.H.P.”: Panto, was not dead in Fogland
this last plum-pudding time. London aiid
suburbs supplied 15 and the provinces 75.
“Dick Whittington” occupied 14 theatres,
“Cinderella” 13, and “Babes in the Wood'
11. Principals included Marie Burke, Eve
Gray, Mona Magnet, Elsie Prince, the
Fallow Twins, Billy Percy, Wee Georgie
Wood, Pip Powell and Mark Daly, all well
knowp to Australian audiences.

SHADOW SHOWS.
“Evenings for Sale,” at Sydney Prince
Edward, begins with the departure from
Merriville (U»S.A.) of Mary Boland, a
stout, jolly widow. She is off to Vienna,
which has replaced Paris in the affections
of Hollywood since the French repudiated
their debts to the U.S.A. In Vienna is Her-
bert Marshall, young, handsome, an ex-
officer of the Imperial Guard, the former pos-
sessor of an ancestral home of the dimen-
sions of Versailles. As an alternative to
suicide he has become a dancing partner at
the restaurant where Charles Buggies, who
was his butler in the days of his glory, is
a waiter. Almost anyone can guess the rest
the vulgar slights put upon the hero, which
he bears with aristocratic composure; the
devastating effect on the ladies of his beau-
tiful appearance and manners; the heart-
rending misunderstanding which leads tne
one girl he loves to congratulate him on
liis engagement to poor, clumsy, worshipping
Mary. Boland, and then break down and rush
sobbing from his fatal presence; the happy
ending with close-up of the young people m
each other’s arms. It is a flawless produc-
tion in its way, but there’s nothing much in
it. Sari Maritza, the heroine, is a lovely
little thing, and she dresses better and over-
acts less than she did in “Monte Carlo Mad-
ness.” Marshall, except for an occasional
expression of insolent nausea at the crudi-
ties of his clients, betrays no more emotion
than a good butler. But, then, he is like
that in all his films. Miss Boland is the
most interesting of the bunch. Her exub-
erant American female whose eyes, mouth
and hands are never still has evidently been
copied from life.
H- * *
The cast of “Rain,” at Sydney State,
suffers by comparison with that of the silent
in which Gloria Swanson played Sadie
Thompson. Joan Crawford hasn’t made an
honest attempt to depict the kind of slat-
ternly wench who preys on soldiers and
sailors in seaport towns. She isn’t blowsy
enough; her shoes in particular are alto-
gether too exquisite. Walter Huston’s mis-
sionary is a strident, thin-lipped Savonarola.
The reading of Lionel Barrymore, who made
the holy man an emotional weakling:—prac-
tically a pathological case —-struck this critic
as much more plausible. A disastrous
•feature of the production is that none of
the principals with the exception of Guy
Kibbee (his drink-sodden trader is _ a gem,
by the-way) shows any signs of feeling hot.
The highly realistic manner in which Barry-
more sweated did a lot to create the required
atmosphere of unsettling heat and huinidity.
His was, of course, an easier job in every
way than Huston’s. “Rain” is a great screen
story, but it is one of those that are best
left unspoken. The missionary’s rantings
are so unconvincing in this elaborate Mile-
stone production that they caused sniggers
in all parts of the house on Saturday night;
and Joan Crawford has too much to say
after her conversion, and is proportionately
tedious.
* * *
Sydney Plaza replaced “The Maid of the
Mountains” last week with “Jack’s the Boy.”
The principal clown is Jack Hulbert, of
“Sunshine Susie” fame. Hulbert is no
vocalist, and there are better dancers ; yet he
has taken London by storm and lie threatens
to do the same by Sydney. Part of the
secret of his success is probably his spon-
taneity and the actor-proof situations which
are provided for him. The son of a Scot-
land Yard official, he joins the London
police and piles up streams of cars. Set to
catch a thief, he arrests instead a model of
Charlie Peace in Madame Tussaud’s wax-
works. Cicely Courtneidge is another of the
show’s bright spots, and Winifred Shotter
furnishes the love interest and some clever
dancing turns. Also at the Plaza is-“ Nort-
hern Lights,” a record of the British Arctic
Air Route Expedition of 1931. The voyage
to Greenland in the Quest, the establish-
ment of the base camp, the hunting trips
and the aerial flights are explained by fine
camera work and interesting comments.
* * *
Edgar Wallace’s “The Calendar,” at
Sydney Mayfair, is a racing drama in which
the persuasive and slightly wooden Herbert
Marshall plays the hero. Edna Best is the
girl he loves, but Gordon Harker, as a
retired burglar and butler, is the chief lure,
His fascinatingly ugly dial and Cockney
backchat were much appreciated on the
night , this Showman visited the Mayfair.
Marshall is an honest racing man, but owing
to the machinations of a vamp (Anne Grey)
he gets warned off. The racecourse scenes
and the inquiry before the stewards at which
the hero is exonerated are nicely done.
“The Hound of the Baskervilles,” for
which Edgar Wallace wrote the whole of the
dialogue, is another 1932 version of a 1902
thriller. The fight with the escaped convict
on the moor, the mauling of Sir Henry by
the Great Dane and Holmes’s tussle with
Stapleton are exciting. Robert Rondel isn’t
much like the popular conception of Holmes,
but then the same applies to all these screen
pictures of the great man and his associates,
There are some attractive shots of Devon-
shire scenery.
* * *
“Second-hand" Wife,” at Sydney Regent, is
about Ralph Bellamy and his catty missus,
Helen Vinson, who no longer loves him.
What more natural than that he should turn
to Sally Eilers? The unworthy Helen gets
her divorce—though Ralph and Sally, it is
perhaps unnecessary to say, are as pure as
the driven snow—and a row begins over the
chee-ild. After a considerable amount of
anguish the chee-ild accrues to Ralph and
Helen retires discomfited. Karol Kay plays
the musical prodigy around whom the battle
rages, and her fiddling is one of the show’s
redeeming features.
The other Regent picture is about a horde
of kids who save the hero (James Dunn), a
zealous district attorney, from bein^murdered
by crooks. One of the kids is wounded in the
mix-up and his sufferings bring Mr. Dunn
and Miss Boots Mallory, who have become
estranged, together again. The sob-stuff is
painful, and the humor amende,
* w *
The Haymarket, Sydney, shows two cut-
to-pattern films, the first for picturegoers of
from seven to 12, the second for those of
12 and over. Tom Mix in “Flaming Guns,”
on Tony Junior, gallops incredible distances
over incredibly rough country at incredible
speed to save’ the ranch from cattle thieves
and marry the owner’s daughter. In “Afraid
to Talk,” a police commissioner and a Judge
start an anti-gangster campaign and save
young Eric Linden, a bellhop “framed” for a
murder which the racketeers didn’t want
sheeted home to the real killer. Sidney Fox,
as Eric’s wife, provides the sob touch. Tlie
casts arc capital, though Mix is becoming
increasingly hard to swallow as a juvenile
hero of romance.

ISSY : “Abie, my poy, de sooner I never see your face vunce more, the better it vill be
for both of us ven ve don’t meet vun another.”
“Le Glorieux” : “Did I ever tell yer about
’ow my ol’ mare ’ere lorst ’er tail?” asked
Old Bill. “It ’appened in a storm. It
com'e up quiet like when I was in the middle
uv a big patch o’ timber, an’ the fust thing
I knows the lightnin’ is strikin’ all round
me. Then it starts to rain. I kicks me feet
outa the stirrups an’ stirs the ol’ mare up
a bit. I wanted ter get outa that timber lad.
Well, the ground’s soon under water an’
the lightnin’ gettin’ worse. Presently a big
flash comes, an" I see it .shoot out between
’er feet. At that she tears the wet reins
outa me fingers an’ off. Cripes! she did go,
an’ I just ’ung on an’ ’oped she wouldn’t ’it
anything. I just reckoned we must be
gettin’ near the edge o’ the timber when a
big flash comes, an’ I sees a big ql’ gum,
three foot through, dead ahead. I reckons
she’s all in, an’ I better make a jump before
she ’its. Before I ’ad time another flash
splits the ol’ gum from top to bottom with
the mare right atop of it. It blinds me;
( but I feels her rise an’ gets a dim idea of
• uer sailin’ through the crack. Then I hears
a flamin’ great smack right behind, an’ over
me shoulder I sees the ol’ tree ’as closed up
agin. Well, I got to camp, near dead with
fright, an’ in the mornin’ I notices the ol’
mare’s tail is nipped off neat at the butt.
She must’ve jest got through that crack in
time 1”

“Larrapinta” : I’ll second “Rana” when he
says “Spare that frog” (B. $/2/’33). In
my Q’land days I worked for a squatter who
married a Melbourne girl. When the young
bride awakened after her first night in her
new home the first thing which met her eye
was a row of fat green frogs upon the edge
of the wash-basin. Her husband tried to
convince her that the frogs were friends, but
she refused to listen, and they were tossed
outside. So was every other frog which she
discovered. But a week later I saw her
down by the waterhole, chasing frogs, and
when she came back she showed me an
apron fill of fat green “Rodders” which she
was taking inside. “Anything is better than
those beastly cockroaches,” she explained;
and within a month’ she had not only tamed
quite a lot of the cockroach-gobblers, but had
given them names into the bargain. She had
evidently read Mark Twain’s story of the
jumping frog, for the one who could leap
the farthest was named “Cicero,” and great
was, the wailing when he met an untimely
end under one of her husband’s boots.
“Fitzwilliam”: “Kerberos” (B. 8/2/'33)
has the wrong dog by the tail. The St.
Bernard was never a sheepdog, but, accord-
ing to the traditions of the monastery, a
cross between the native mastiff and the
ancient bulldog. The monks kept that strain
pure until the bitter winter of 1812, the one
that scuppered Napoleon. During that abnor-
mal year they were obliged to send out the
bitches as well as the dogs, which was not
their usual practice. The hard winter was
too much for the ladies, who all died, and the
breed was lost. The monks then imported
Newfoundland bitches, which they crossed
with the Surviving lords of the harem. The
result was a dog of the stamina required,
but the rough coat of the Newfoundland
proved a disadvantage in snow, and the
monks gradually bred it out, and evolved a
short-coated dog of a similar type to their
old breed. They cast all rough-coated pups,
and sold them to the adjacent villagers, who
bred from them. It was this cull from the
monastery that was introduced into Eng-
land in the ’sixties, and became a fashionable
craze in the ’eighties. But the modern
English dog is not a bit like his monastic
cousin, which is the dog that Lloyd George
has now introduced. When he becomes a
cult, which he is sure to do in dog-mad
England, the quarrels between the adherents
of the two breeds will be long and strong.

“Lofty”: “Mulgo” (B. 25/l/’33) is talk-
ing through his hat when he mentions catch-
ing worms with pincers; they would snap the
head clean off at the first pull. The way of
professional catchers is to sandpaper or rasp
the tip of their index finger until it is raw
and bleeding.
They then drag
a bait consisting
of any sort of
stinking fish
through the shal-
low water of a
receding wav e.
The worm sticks
his head up as he
gets a whiff of
the bait. The
catcher then
gently places his
raw finger - tip
near the head.
T h c worm
stretches further
out to investi-
gate. There is a
lightning snap of
the thumb and a
quick, even pull
straight upwards.
Worms anything
from two to five
feet long are thus
drawn from their
holes. Another
way for those
who are a bit
squeamish about
the raw finger is
to use a small
wedge - shaped
piece of cheese.
This is held in
the left hand,
and, as the worm
bends over to tackle it, the right hand
is slid in behind the head. A quick
snap of the index finger and thumb and
you have him —perhaps. It takes a lot
of practice to get just the firmness that will
hold the slippery head and not break it off.
It’s true about the fiver a week. I’ve made
more in holiday-time.

“Blank”: Recently two chaps with no pre-
vious mining experience returned to Charters
Towers (Q.) from a dry-blowing expedition
disgusted with their lack of success. They left
their dry-blower in the backyard of a friend’s
dwelling, asking him to take it to pieces and
stpre it for them. A few days after they had
moved on the friend, in course of complying
with their request, found small nuggets of
a total value of more than £9 jambed in
crevices. It isn’t much good prospecting
for gold if you don’t know it when yon
see it. •
“D.J.H.”: An interesting old house is
Oldbury, at Medway, near Berrimu
(N.S.W.). It was built by convict labor
and the stone walls are three
and a half feet thick. On
many of the massive doors
and windows the original
enormous locks and bolts rel
main. There seems to have;
been no definite building plan,
for the rooms open jnto one
another in the most incon-
venient manner, and those up-
stairs are on different levels.
The grim conditions under
which the convicts lived are
made clear by the presence of
dark, damp ’ little prisons
underneath the house, lit by
mere slits. The prisoners
spent their nights chained to
heavy rings, which can still
be seen attached to the walls.
In a flagged courtyard at the
back of the building is a huge stone bath
hollowed out of solid rock.
“Nikko”: A brotherhood in our locality
held its Sunday morning service in a large
room over the baker’s .shop. One Sun-
day morning the leading brother was ex-
pounding the doctrine of eternal damnation
with fine fervor when a delicate stepping
on the stairs caused the attention of the
congregation to wander. Brother Green
arose and had a word outside with the
animal —for the intruder was O’Gilligan’s
goat. The day being a sweltering one, he
left the door open when he returned. Five
minutes later O’Gilligan’s goat appeared in
the aisle and without further waste of time
began to sample some hymn-books. Whis-
pered persuasion having failed, force was
employed, and Brothers Green, White and
Brown essayed to push the visitor towards
the dooi\ The preacher hastily gave out a
hymn, but the singing did not drown the
sounds of altercation in the background.
Sister Green, glancing over her shoulder,
was perturbed to note her husband lying
prone on the floor, while Sister Brown ob-
served with fury that her good man’s best
trousers were ripped open at the knee. But
the real casualty was Brother White, who,
having urged the goat to the stairhead, tried
to push him down. The subsequent thud-
ding, which caused the suspension of the

guineas.”
“Orright, Doctor — an’ if yer find it, I’ll go yer fifty-fifty!”
service, was Brother White being butted
downstairs. O'Gilligan’s goat, after this
hot work, sought diversion in gnawing the
downstairs doormat. The brothers, chastened
and disheartened, retired to the interrupted
service, shut the door and left him to it.

“Erua”: If “I.M.” (B. 8/2/’33) ever
visits M.L. and goes to Rotorua he will
probably find himself surrounded at Mamaku
station by Maori vendors of vegetable cater-
pillars and horseshoe ferns, two souvenirs
every traveller craves. In the old days both
were plentiful, and the caterpillars, retailed
at a shilling each, were an exceedingly pro-
fitable line to Henare and Co. The grub is,
as “I.M.” states, the host for the seed of a
fungus which shoots out of the victim’s
head, grows to a height of a few inches,
and dies off, leaving a caterpillar that lias
the appearance of being petrified, perfect in
every detail, with the dried stem of the
parasite plant sticking, out ‘of its head.
* * * *
“C. Coral” : A report from south-west New
Guinea, close to the Dutch border, indicates
tnat the Tugeri head-hunters have not yet
abandoned their pleasant occupation. About
three months ago, three visiting young men
bought a cutter in Thursday Island and
went prospecting. One left the boat on the
New Guinea coast, 80 miles north of Thurs-
day Island, and managed to gel back by way
of Daru. The other two, after passing
Boigu Island, were not seen again. Boigu
islanders have now learned from friendly
natives over the water a few miles away that
they were killed and their heads taken.
The tragedy is said to have occurred near
the Moreliead River, somewhere in the
locality where a number of escaping Javanese
political prisoners in Dutch New Guinea
were killed about three years back. The
Tugeri head-hunters were much dreaded by
the Saibai and Boigu islanders, who were
victims of raids, although a big tree on
Boigu Island called “Sibui Bui,” on which
heads were hung after the return of raiding
canoes, is evidence that the Boigu men them-
selves were also experts, at the game.

“Plankton”: When at sunset a ruddy
blush spreads over the face of Dame Nature
one might fancifully attribute it in part to
a feeling of shame when the naked bat
(Chiromeles torquatus) flaps languidly out
of the dense Malayan jungle. Not because
of the creature’s nudity, but on account of
its repulsive ugliness. Despite appearance,
however, he is a good family man (I mean
“family bat”), taking his turn in carrying
the baby—or the twins. Dike the mother,
he is equipped with a convenient nursing-
pouch on his underside, below the armpits,
only Mrs. C. Torquatus has teats in hers.
Visualise a stoutish naked animal about
five inches long, with long narrow wings and
a thick tail; a pig-like muzzle and rounded
snout; a pair of prominent ears (capable of
independent movement) ; a neck thick and
goitrous-looking, with a few hairs round it.
The odor emitted from certain glands in
many species of bats is unpleasant, but this
imp of the tropics absolutely stinks.
THE EVERLASTING BUSHRANGER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
As often as, in some up-country town,
Some ancient quits this vale of stress and
strife
And leaves, material for setting down
A handy precis of his strenuous life,
Among the various Famous Men he met,
The memories of whom no distance blurs,
You’ll find, it’s reasonably safe to bet,
That one or two at least were bushrangers.
He may have heard some bygone statesman
sway
A crowd, or hobnobbed with a squatter
king,
But any chap might do that any day ;
Around such incidents no glamors cling.
One might forget the fieriest harangue
That ever stirred a country to revolt,
But not a close-up of the Kelly gang
Or half an hour or so with Thunderbolt.
Morgan and Gardiner, Gilbert, Hall and
Dunn—
Still oldsters pass into the silent land
Whose hours most crowded -were in meeting
one
Or other of the robber-ruffian band.
A purple patch it left, a letter red,
Upon the drabbest record ever fresh ;
It put a halo round a fellow’s, head
Just to have talked with “Starlight” in
the flesh.
Maybe our forebears, as irrational
As we, in times of stolid Georgian kings
Remembered Turpin, also Claude Duval,
When they’d forgotten worthier men and
things.
Heroes and virtues fade, the while it jars
That crimes and criminals will stick like
burrs;
I wonder when obituary pars.
Will let the curtain fall on bushrangers!

Unless you have been specially fortune-favored, the success of your

your own efforts. There may be factors over which you can have no
control, therefore it is the more necessary that you seriously grapple
with those you can yourself govern. Naturally, money must enter into
your plans for to-morrow, but action must be taken to-day if you are
to succeed.

“E.M.S.”: Here in the quarry camp on
the East-West railway, just at the edge of
the Nullarbor Plain, the 30 or 40 abos. who
infest the camp add to our diversions. They
thoroughly despise men who work. Their
social scale starts, with Sid Kidman at the
summit and winds up with the navvy at the
bottom rung. They themselves fit in just
after Sid Kidman. A gin strolls into my
kitchen: “Hello, pretty, lady, you give it tea?
You give it bacca? Two shilling? One
shilling? Frippence?” No answer from me.
My stores are low and I’m too busy to be
bothered. So I have to be put in my place.
“Well, good-bye, ugly phat lady”; and my
visitor removes herself. I see her presently
industriously washing her head in a bucket
while lather creates a halo round her black
face. Very amusing, but presently I can’t
find my Ashes of Roses soap, which came
from town as a treat. No, she didn’t steal
it—these black folk don’t steal—but I must
have left it lying around outside.
“Cooramin”: The other day an old man
named John Lindsay was stung on the nose
by a bee near Mullumbimby (N.S.W.) and
died within 15 minutes. In the doctor s
opinion the poison -went immediately to the
heart. If so, it was more rapid in its effects
than the bite of a venomous snake. Men
in the bush and beekeepers in the aggregate
have registered millions of stings, but the
only other serious case I know of occurred at
iCarcoar (N.S.W.) about 10 years ago. Some
young fellows chopped down a tree in the
neighboring bush, and when one of them,
named Duke Smith, attempted to cut out
the nest the bees attacked him numerously
and unanimously. Within a minute he
was stung in 300 places, and dropped un-
conscious. After his mates had carried him
two miles home, Dr. O’Halloran pulled him
round by injecting doses of strychnine.
* * * *
“M.L.C.”: It is well known that ants keep
herds of aphides which they pasture on the
surrounding greenery for the sake of the
juices they exude, but it is even more sur-
prising that they practise agriculture. Under-
ground hotbeds are formed, made of bitten-
up leaves, and in these are planted the spores
of a certain fungus. When a queen ant goes
out to found anew colony she takes a
piece of this fungus in a pocket below the
mouth. The community spirit of both bees
and ants is a shining example to the human
race. What sacrifice could be greater than
that of the ants who turn themselves into
living store casks by gorging themselves
with honey until their bodies are completely
spherical, and then hang themselves up to
the cellar roof? In the shortage of winter
feed they are taken down and “tapped’’ by
the rest.

“Oran”: The fierce controversy raging in
Sydney newspapers concerning the orchard
manners of the bulbul caused us to watch
carefully the dozens of crested imps that
spend their days in our suburban garden.
The result as far as our experience goes is
an honorable discharge for the bulbul.
Dozens of them for days worked industri-
ously cleaning up a patch of bamboo, with
a plum-tree heavily laden with ripe fruit
two feet away, and betrayed no interest
whatever in the plums. The small orchard
contains apples, mulberries, grapes and other
fruits, but all the bulbuls that have this
season paid us a visit have shown a marked
preference for a diet of insects.

dog he’ll carry him there to drown him if
it is half a mile away. His flight is nearly
always towards water or into rugged coun-
try. Among the rocks lie is as nimble as
a wallaby, despite his 6ft. of body; arid
when pursued in rough places he will turn
on the side of a steep hill or precipice and
there seize the dog, if he can, and hurl the
menace over the rocks. He never makes a
blunder at a wire fence like the kangaroo;
he looks for a dip in the ground or a loose
wire, and crawls underneath. A remarkable
difference in the structure of the two ani-
mals is that the bones of the wallaroo are
like ivory, but easy to work with a knife,
and are made into rings and ornaments,
whilst those of the kangaroo are more like
the bones of cattle —hard and flinty.
'c *!-
“M.L.C.” : The “parrakelia” mentioned by
“Wai-hoi” (B. l/2/’33) appears to be a
Heaven-sent plant for arid parts, but one
never hears of it being cultivated. A shower
of rain is enough to start the seed into growth,
and after that the succulent leaves provide
enough moisture for the plant to develop and
mature its seed. A pastoralist who had
cattle out in dry country and could not get-
to them for two 1 years stated that, when
reached, they were in tip-top condition. There
was plenty of parrakelia, and this had
enabled them to thrive with practically no
water for two years. The same plant, or a
very closely-allied species (Cdlandrina calyp-
trnta), with purple-red blossoms, is found as
far south as Tasmania, and apparently pre-
fers basaltic country. Why not grow it?

“Womerali”.: It seems to be in human
nature to gamble. A seventy-year-old abo.
in the central-west of N.S.W. maintains
that the Bogan-Laclilan tribe hazarded
wagers long before contact with the whites
was made. Boomerangs and nullas were
thrown into a “pool,” and the players selected
a spot a hundred yards from a tuft of
umbrella grass. At a signal they raced to
this tuft and immediately grasped one of
the heads, which have’from nine to fifteen
spikes. The chap who pulled the head with
the most spikes won. Another contest, with
similar stakes, was conducted by throwing
nullas through thick grass. The one who
hurled his missile the furthest through the
grass collected the prize.
**■ * *
“Mulgo”: The name Kanimbla (N.S.W.)
perpetuates the memory of two abo. chiefs,
Kanim and Bulla, who niled on opposite
sides of Cox’s River. Trouble occurred be-
tween the clans, and the chiefs met. for a
peace conference on two peaks overlooking
a narrow gorge. Conference opened with
mutual good wishes; but very soon they
were hurling insults at each other, and then
stones, which were plentiful about the spots
where the chiefs stood. Their compatriots
were grouped in the valley below, and
during the rain of missiles across the border
the groups shouted encouragement to their
respective leaders till the hills echoed with
the yells of Kanim and Bulla. The fusillade
raged all day, but at dusk a gibber whizzed
against Bulla’s nose and knocked him out.
Therewith ended the peace conference, and
the peaks were known afterwards as Kanim
and Bulla, from which came the composite
name.

“Lomkey Ree”: “S.T.S.” (B. 25/1/’33)
speaks of the Backstairs Passage swim as
“assumedly impossible’’; but it has been
done. Some of the hard cases who
settled Kangaroo Island before the Wakefield
colonisation scheme got started at Adelaide
kidnapped three abo. women from the main-
land and took them to the island. The
women later on got hold of a small
dinghy that would safely hold only two.
One "of them, with a piccaninny at her
breast, was left behind to await developments,
and the other two got safely to the main-
land. A little later her tribe found the
third woman dead on the Cape Jervis coast,
with her dead baby tied on her back. She
had swum- the passage (nine miles at that
point) with her baby as a handicap.

, A Sydney woman drops a line from
.Tapoon Vale, North Queensland: —
“The Valley” is very beautiful, and unlike any
spot I have ever seen. It is a long narrow valley
running from the Bellenden Ker and Bartle Frere
to the sea, and if you can imagine Sydney Harbor
turned into land you will get some idea of its shape.
The flat land is under cane and high dark hills run
from the very edge of the fields in terraced lines
to the Great Dividing Range. These hills are covered
with natural forest, immense trees, lovely blossom-
ing shrubs and vines, orchids and wild lilies and
the ginger plant, which has a flower like an inverted
rose, but the petals are like hard, red wax. Gorgeous
birds and butterflies are everywhere, and all day soft
mists float from point to-point of the • hills or
nestle in the high valleys. Rushing rivers sweep
across the valley; sometimes they rise 20ft. in a
few hours in the wet season. And how it can rain!
Even in Java I have not seen or heard rain like
that in Japoon Vale. All the citrus fruits, bananas,
pines, paw-paws and granadillas grow and have a
most delicious flavor. The life is very primitive,
although not far from the main North-South railway.
We have only a weekly mail, no hotel or picture
show, and no roads to speak of. Everybody gets
about on wheels —not in motor-cars, but in, a “push-
and pull,’’ which is 'something like a bathchair, or
on a “flat-top,” which is a platform on four wheels,
propelled by a pole or by a blackboy who kneels
on one side and uses one leg a la scooter. Meat
and bread are brought to the Valley on these
“vehicles,” which all run on the lines of rails
laid for the cane trucks.
HOPBUSH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Across the street a garden lies,
A place of measurements exact;
Its symmetry offends my eyes,
Its lines and angles don’t attract.
Its blossoms languidly expose
Their charms before me all in vain;
Their sweetness wearies one who knows
The scent of hopbush after rain.
Its flowers, to my pagan eye,
Seem merely bold-faced courtesans,
Who beckon every passer-by
With wave of showy, jewelled fans;
The dewdrops no more brightly glow
That from these gaudy petals stream
Than those the morning breezes blow
From hopbush blossoms, pink and cream.
In fancy I have seen of late
A three-chain road that wheel-ruts seam,
Down which there comes with swaying gait
A silent-footed camel team :
The echoes of the leader’s bell
My ears so wistfully retain
That cver-welcome message spell:
“The hopbush is in bloom again.”
Not many weeks will pass before
In drafting-yard and
I do my share of work once more,
’Midst dust that loiters overhead.
For I shall never rest content,
Pent up all day in city lane,
Whilst western winds bring down the' scent
Of hopbush blossoms after rain.

How Australia Neglects' Her Great Ones.
(Specially written for the
“Daily Maunderer .”)
Daniel Hubbard, Australia’s Larwood of
the cricketing ’forties, used to take the field
in a cabbage-tree hat with tails of scarlet
ribbon hanging behind. “When he ran to-
wards the crease, the tails whistled in the
breeze,” wrote an admirer of the period.
Hubbard, disliking the under-hand methods
of the bowlers of his day, introduced a
round-arm throw,” which proved highly
effective: so much so that, in a single in-
nings against the Currency Club, D.II. hit

response to a proposal that a statue should
be erected in his honor, departed with his
family for the West Indies, and there fol-

lamented death in IS6(>. On a recent tour
of the W.I. I visited Hubbard’s last domi-
cile and was there shown, in a sugar-shed,
an ancient mangle, heavily constructed, with
a handle eighteen inches long. This mangle

PICTURE OF A STAR.
She lias been young for an incredibly long
time.
She is golden-haired, but she has only been
like that for the past fifteen years.
She works hard. In fact, she is always
working. Even in her hours of (photo-
graphed) ease, when she is revealed playing
with her pet snake.
She has been told by newspaper-men that
she is the ideal Cleopatra and/or Helen of
Troy, Juliet, Sappho, Marie Antoinette,
Joan of Arc, Venus Aphrodite, Lady Isabel,
Flora MacDonald, Queen of Sheba, Galatea
and Paddy-the-Next-Best-Thing. And she
agrees.
Her favorite amusements are face-steam-
ing, permanent-waving, slimming, manicur-
ing, girth control, clay-packing and paint-
ing. Her collection of press-notices runs
into thousands, but one always remembers
her best as a firm believer in the beneficent
properties of Squidd’s Narcissus Skin Food.

CAUGHT!
Looking into the mocking eyes across the
table, Plantagenet Pickmeup realised that
he was trapped. God! What a fool he had
been —what an utter fool! And the woman
in whom he had had such faith, whom he
had blindly trusted.... Had she no heart?
Again he gazed fascinated, horror-stricken,
at his hand, red with.. . .he shuddered. What
would be the end of it all.. . .the Bridge?....
She had led him into taking this step, he
thought savagely, she who now sat silent
intently watching the other man, speaking no
word, giving no faintest sign to help him.
Tensely he faced his antagonist, defiance in
his glance. Plantagenet’s heart beat wildly.
Would he?
The tense silence is broken. Ilis opponent
leans towards him and speaks, a nore
of cold defiance in his voice: “Get your four
hearts!”

STRAIGHT FROM THE WHALE’S
MOUTH.
A few sportsmen had their heads together
over the bar of the Hotel Nineveh. They
were discussing the prospects for the Autumn
Derby—the biggest whale-event of the year.
Jonah whispered a mysterious name to the
others.
“No fear ! Hasn’t a dog’s chance,” they
laughed.
Jonah was palpably annoyed. “All right,”
he said as he stamped out. “You wait and
see. I’ve got inside information!”

MUNITIONS.
No revolver-friend that has been offered
of late years in this sunny Austral land of
onrs is the equal for penetrating power and
all-round efficiency of America’s beautiful
little Capone-Thomson .004. I was shown
an exquisite specimen in a Surry Hills
cellar over the week-end. The Capone-
Thomson likes a dark corner, particularly at
this time of year, when policemen are being
done in with such zest. This great little
worker, which has its votaries in every
underworld home nowadays, needs little or
no attention —a sip of oil every week or so
amply meets its modest requirements—and
it fits inconspicuously into either trouser-
pocket or reticule.
A friend. who is just back from a visit to
New York’s famous Bowery showed me a
charming machine-gun novelty this week. It
is one of the many beneficent results of
Prohibition, I am told. All who care for
loveliness should find a place for this beauty
in the family armory. With an attractive
sheen on the barrel and stock it quickly
arrests—er, perhaps I should have said
tak^s —the discriminating eye; but the belt,
incorporating, as it does, , a device which
absolutely does away with jamming, is its
star feature. The Death Dealer is its trade
name, and it can be secured by those in the
know at the reasonable price of £125, which
includes a carriage suitable for mounting on
either front verandah or car.
Another real joy-maker is the Grapefruit
Bomb, an improvement in all respects on the
old-fashioned Pineapple, being larger and
proportionately more satisfactory in its
effects. The Grapefruit was unanimously
placed first in the recent census taken by
the National Spanish Bomb Society; and
the Mafia, Black Hand, I.W.W. and Moscow
Friends of. Man, to name only a few cele-
brated societies, have acclaimed it. This
attractive bomb-person likes a cool place well
away from the stove and it calls for little
or no attention. Keep it dry and throw it
straight, and you will always find it happy
in its work. Priced at 275. 6d., this hardy
Chicago favorite is literally an essential to
the happiness of households that are at outs

INS-I
'J'HE interna! insulation of a radio
battery is vitally important. In any
battery, a leakage of electricity or chemi-
cals may occasionally occur from one
cell. If this affects other cells the
battery quickly fails.
Now—Diamond embodies a new ex-
clusive insulation material, used in a
.new way. It is proof against either
chemical or electrical leak-
age. It isolates every cell,
and absolutely removes any
chance of a leakage spreading. It is
the only 100% perfect insulation made!
The illustration at right shows the new
Diamond method of isolating each cell
in a perfectly insulated compartment,
tirely protected from leakage on sides
and bottom. It is at the base of the cells!
where corrosion is most dangerous. No'
other battery protects this danger spot.

THE
STUFF TO GIVE 'EM
MEGGITT'S LINSEED MEAL
WHEAT-PRODUCTION COSTS.
“Salmon Gums”: The price per bushel
required to make wheat-farming pay varies
largely with the individual farmer. In an
article in the We.stralian “Journal of Agri-
culture” the director, G. L. Sutton, stresses
this fact, and gives an estimate of the cost of
production on an imaginary farm of 1000
acres, following a 300-acre fallow, crop and
grazing routine. Capital expenditure is esti-
mated at £2709, the principal item being
clearing 900 acres at 255., £1125. As to this
255. per acre, it is a good farm in the West-
ralian wheat-belt that doesn’t contain a por-
tion of lighter—not necessarily inferior—
land. The practice is for the beginner to
clear the lightest patch first, crop it, get
some more land ready during the winter
for next year’s crop ; and so on. The man who
does most of his own clearing will halve
the cost and spread it over a period of years.
Of the other items set out by Mr. Sutton
the reaper and binder (£79), wheat-pickler
(£5), engine (£119), chaffcuttcr (£2O) and
elevator (£11), could, 1 think, be omitted.
The first is used on most farms about six
days per year, and the cost of hiring one,
until circumstances permitted purchase,
would be small. A wheat-pickler can be
made out of a barrel mounted on a frame.
Arid £250 is allowed on a house. Old-timers
would have laughed at the notion. Mud-
brick houses were comfortable in the early
days; and a house built with, rocks (most
farms in Westralia abound with them) and
cement can be constructed at considerably
less than £250. Deducting £550 for clearing,
£IOO for the house and £240 for unneces-
saries, the total becomes £lßl9 —more rea-
sonable, at least.
Out-of-pocket expenses range from £l7O
for a 12-bushel crop to £212 for a 24-bushel
crop. At 2s. Gd. a bushel, the former crop
would, it is said, show a debit balance of
£130; the 24-bushel crop a credit balance of
£lB5. Included in these estimates is interest
(£162) on an expenditure of £2709, which,
as we have seen, can be considerably reduced.
On these showings the Westralian wheat
farm with an average of approximately 12
bushels must be a losing proposition. In
some cases it is. But for the man who is
prepared to work for a small income
while he is building up a substantial asset,
and who will economise wherever possible,
the game will provide a good living.
SWORD YIELDS WELL.
Sword, a wheat variety bred at Roseworthy
College, is coming into favor in South Aus.
J. B. Carrigg, of Harnley Bridge, won the
prize given annually by the Royal Agricul-
tural Society for the champion wheat crop
with what is described by W. J. Spafford, the
Deputy-Director of Agriculture, as “a beauti-
fully even crop” of Sword. The paddock has
for years been Worked on the bare fallow-
wheat-pasture rotation. It was ploughed in
July, harrowed in early September, and
cultivated in late September, October and
April. In the second week in May, 901 b.
of seed and 1001 b. of super. (45 per cent.)
per acre were put in with a combine. Mr.
Carrigg tried Nabawa and Gluyas as well
as Sword ; the Nabawa went just on 10 bags
to the acre; the Gluyas 9| bags, the Sword
41 bushels. But for a heavy wind just before
harvesting, it would probably have yielded
50 bushels.
In a chat with “Yattalunga.V of the
“Advertiser,” Mr. Carrigg mentioned that
the Harnley Bridge property has been in the
family since 1861; his father was one of the
district pioneers. The old man, a good
farmer, often got an 18-bushel crop before
the super.-days. The son has inherited his
thoroughness: “I always harrow the land
before seeding,” he says, “and get the best
seed possible—l wouldn’t think of sowing
without putting it through the grader and
pickling it.” He keeps sheep to clean up
the fallows, maintains a herd of the Friesian-
Jersey cross, and fattens pigs of the Tam.-
Berk. cross with skim milk and screenings.
“And I have always stuck to horses; no
tractor for me.”
BENCUBBIN PROVES ITSELF.
Visiting the Merredin (W.A.) State farm on
a field day, Senator Guthrie was impressed
with test plots of Bencubbin, anew wheat
variety. “I’ll buy the first bag of seed you
sell,” he said to the manager. “Right you
are!” was the reply. The bag of Bencubbin
duly came to hand, and was sown on Mr.
Guthrie’s Riverina property, Bulgandra, near
the Rand railway station. It yielded 44
bags. This is to be sown on clean fallow
during the present .season, and it is hoped
that from the resultant harvest seed will
be available for other N. S'. Wales farmers
—supplies in Westralia, as well as other
States, are scarce.
Mr. Guthrie has a glowing opinion of
Bencubbin wheat. He reckons it superior
to Free Gallipoli, the leading variety in
Victoria, his home State, and also to
Nabawa. Yet Nabawa has given him excel-
lent results. Fifty acres of it at Bulgandra
returned an average of 48 bushels to the
acre. Altogether the Guthrie farm, which is
worked on shares, yielded 30,000 bushels,
averaging 27.
MUSTERING FOR SHEARING.
“Liss” : “Booraby’s” notions (B. 15/2/’33)
are as out-of-date as his reference to the
Mitchell grass of the western N.S.W. plains;
the rabbits cleaned it up long ago. In any
case the harvesting of a hundred or so tons
of bush hay each year would never be a
practicable business in the west owing to
lack of plant and labor. In n.-w. Queensland,
where in good years the Mitchell and Flin-
ders grasses are very thick, and the land
itself is adapted to the use of mower and
rake, I found very little bush hay was made.
Practical men had tried it at one time or
another, but all had given it up for various
reasons: the cost was too high, too much
idle plant had to be kept, capable labor
could not be' found, and not sufficient of the
hay could be stored —it would just be the
proverbial drop in the bucket when it came
to a dry spell.
The idea of the depot paddock at the shed,
into which “Booraby” would muster both
his shorn sheep and his woollies on their
way from and to the shed, reads well, but
it would not work on most runs. In the
first place, sheep brought in from outside
paddocks to a small one adjacent to the
shed will generally camp in the corner, and
will not. graze; secondly, such small pad-
docks tend to become dust-heaps owing to
the traffic, and are the source of most of
the dust that enters the shed. A trip
through, say, s.-w. Riverina will show many
big sheds standing on what were once well-
grassed plains, and are now red. scalded
areas; concentrated mobs year after year
tramped the ground to dust; wind did the
rest. Many men are now trying to check wind
erosion by ploughing strips and breaks
across the patches to catch and hold the
seed. Thirdly, the water supply would have
to be cut out of all proportion to the size
and general utility of the paddock, except
on those runs where the shed is near a bore
head. Depot paddocks at the shed have
their uses, but they are generally for the
collection of stragglers out of each mob as
they come in and for wet-weather grazing.
It is easy to write airily of growing fodder
trees for sheep, but how many such trees
does “Booraby” imagine would be needed
to see a flock of, say, 60,000 through a dry
shearing? And what does he think they
would cost to establish?
Except under very adverse conditions, such
as drought, when one simply does the best
one can, humane and careful handling of
sheep during the muster is simply a matter
of method and foresight. If sheep are habi-
tually hustled and rushed and crowded it
only proves that all hands are careless and
incompetent.
Generally, if the run is a big one and
the country at all rough, three camps are
needed —one to muster, one to drove to and
from an appointed camp near the shed, and
one to take away from the shed. The over-
seer would be in charge of the muster; and
he would hand over to a contract drover, who
would deliver at the shed, handling, feeding
and watering hi.s mob as if on the roads.
He would pick up the “shornies” there if
only two camps were used, or at the depot
camp at a water near the shed, where
they would have been taken by a jackeroo
and a man or so. Thus no sheep are kept
hanging about the shed ; they leave a camp
on water to come in and be shorn and return
to it immediately. This method will be
found very economical, as no casual labor
has to be employed, and no very large plant
is required, the drover having both. The
important point is that sheep should be
droved and not driven, but this applies to
all stock at all times.
NATURAL LIME.
“Alf Alpha”: In reply to “Albany” (B.
l/2/’33), natural lime, from the agricultural
standpoint, is any deposit of impure calcium
carbonate in which, while lime is pre-
dominant, there are appreciable, amounts of
other mineral substances, such as magnesia,
iron, manganese, phosphoric acid, chlorine,
sulphur and iodine. > \
As examples, I quote soft yellow limestone,
chalk and marl. Soft yellow limestones are
favored because they contain up to 1.5 p.c.
of phosphoric acid and comparatively large
amounts of iodine and other important
mineral substances. Sea shells would be in-
cluded but for the cost of grinding.
Hard grey limestone, marble and calcite
are practically pure calcium carbonate. Their
hardness and purity, while making them suit-
able for the production of high-grade burnt
lime, tell against their use for top-dressing;
first, because of the cost of mining and grind-
ing ; second, because they supply lime only.
At present there is little difference in the
price of the ground high-quality limestone
and natural limes. But when liming becomes
more general (and it is going ahead very
fast) the natural lime deposits of Australia,
which are legion, will be exploited commer-
cially. They outcrop or occur close to the
surface, with this additional advantage—
they are either soft enough to provide easy
and cheap grinding or they exist as amorphous
powders; one may, therefore, be excused for
prophesying a reduction to half the existing
price per ton. This is what all cockies want.
It is a little far-fetched to assume that a
ton of 70 p.c. lime (calcium carbonate) will
not produce a similar result to a ton of 90
p.c. lime (calcium carbonate) when top-
dressed on even soil in the same paddock.
We have not advanced so far as to be able
to calculate exactly, if at all, how much lime
(calcium carbonate) a given soil requires.
There are formulae certainly, but they won’t
stand criticism, much less a trial. In a
nutshell, the natural limes, besides giving all
lime benefits, will help to correct mineral de-
ficiency, thereby avoiding the necessity of pur-
chasing high-priced mineral licks of doubt-
ful quality. It is assumed, of course, that
super, is used in conjunction with liming.
As to burnt lime, why go to the trouble
and expense of burning the stuff when you
know it quickly reverts to its original condi-
tion once it is applied to the soil? “Albany”
wants chemical symbols. I will let him have
them by post, if he likes, but I think they
frighten and confuse the majority of cockies.
In brief, we burn limestone in a kiln; the
lime is slaked with water; the slaked lime
is exposed to air. When ground burnt lime
is placed on the soil it quickly slakes —takes
up water. Then carbonation ensues night
and day until the burnt lime is finally
changed back to its original form of calcium
carbonate. These remarks on burnt lime
versus ground limestone do not apply to
special cases, such as dressing swampy or
low-lying ground for the purpose of combat-
ing liver fluke and dusting certain market-
garden crops to destroy insect pests and
fungus diseases.
“Albany” is a man after my own heart
in respect to top-dressing with complete fer-
tilisers. This is a system which I have advo-
cated for several years. Because of the phos-
phate deficiency of Australian soils, super,
has proved itself of paramount importance in
top-dressing pasture land, but this does not
mean that it always provides the correct
nutritive balance. If there is a chance of
the health of beasts suffering because of a
disturbed and abnormal nutritive balance, it
will pay to top-dress with a complete or
mixed fertiliser. It provides probably not
such an immediate increase in the return
per acre, but one which is more lasting.
THE WERRIBEE FARM.
Dear Bulletin, —Some time ago, writing
to you re baby beef, I said the Metropoli-
tan Board’s Farm at Werribee (Vie.) was
losing at least £IO,OOO a year by not export-
ing its prime steers instead of selling them
in the Melbourne market. Evidently the
heads are taking notice, for the board has
now sold 3000 for export at a fixed price per
1001 b. This will give a little relief to the
men who depend on the local market. The
board made a profit of only £IO,OOO-odd on
its cattle operations last year, due, no
doubt, to the small margin between purchased
stores and prime fats. If it will treble
its breeding cattle it would not need to buy
many stores, and if it kept the best of the
heifers for breeding purposes, in a very short
time, with careful selection, it would have
the finest herds of beef cattle in the world,
let alone the Commonwealth, as the farm
can fatten all the year round. Incidentally,
its profits would be doubled. Even as things
are, every stockman who can possibly
manage it should pay the farm a visit; it
will be a revelation and an education to
most.—Yours, William D. McCallum.
BREEDING rOLLED CATTLE.
“Bahb Dwyer” : There’s no need for any-
body who wants to change from horneys to
poleys to go about the business in a slipshod
manner. Mendel’s law applies. The poley
condition is dominant to the horney; cross
the two and the resultant progeny will be
poleys, provided yon started with a pure
dominant poley, bull or cow. When this first
filial generation is bred together, the pro-
geny will be in the ratio of three polled to
one horney. The horney condition is known
as recessive, and when it makes its appear-
ance it will breed true —there will be no
more poleys.
Of the poleys of this first generation, one-
third are pure dominants and two-thirds
impure dominants. The pure dominants
will, of course, always breed true. The
difficulty is that you can’t tell by looking
at a beast whether it’s pure or impure. A
convenient method of overcoming it is by
crossing with pure recessives. If he is a
pure dominant the progeny will be all
poleys; if impure, he will get half poleys
and half horneys. This method of testing
a sire for pure dominance has been employed
by stud-breeders for many years. It is in-
fallible, provided sufficient numbers are
raised to enable the Mendelian ratio to mani-
fest itself.
CRUSHED WHEAT FOR COWS.
“When wheat is cheap, it can be fed pro-
fitably to dairy cows,” says the editor of
the “Livestock Bulletin” ; and L. N. Snook,
of the Westralian Department of Agricul-
ture, endorses the statement. Writing in
the “Sunday Times” Mr. Spook states that
“wheat is a liighly-nutritious, easily-digested
concentrate; it contains between 9 p.c. and
10 p.c. of digestible protein and has an
energy value of 72, as compared with oats
60, and bran 50; it is one of the best food-
stuffs available. Crushed wheat is greatly
relished by livestock, and it often improves
the palatability of the whole ration. It
should prove an ideal supplement for high-
producing cows which have to be encouraged
to eat to their maximum capacity.”
Mr. Snook quotes the experience of A. P.
Herbert, of Nungarin (W.A.), who has been
feeding wheat to his stud Jersey cattle for
a number of years. His herd has been
officially tested for over two years ; the cows
under test have produced remarkably well
during the long dry summer. Mr. Herbert’s
concentrate - ration consists of equal parts
of crushed oats, crushed wheat and bran. At
times wheat alone has been fed to the cows
(along with roughage) without any diminu-
tion in the milk yield. As much as 81b.
of crushed wheat has been fed per head per
day without any apparent deleterious result.
But Mr. Snook reminds farmers that
wheat is a starchy food, and that if crushed
wheat is fed to cows some protein-rich supple-
ment must be used, except where ample
leguminous roughage or grain is available.
He suggests meatmeal: 101b. to 1001b. of
crushed wheat. Cattle on a, cereal diet also
require lime. “They should receive about
2 p.c. of bonemeal in their concentrated
ration, or, alternatively, quicklime should be
slaked in the drinking water.” It should be
added that Nungarin, where crushed wheat
has been successfully fed to dairy cows, is
in the wheat belt and gets only 12 inches
or so of rain per annum, practically none
in the summer.
REPAIRING FARM VEHICLES.
“Yarri” : Much of this work can be done
at home.' There is nothing difficult about
a cart or dray to any man who can use
ordinary tools. He has the broken part
for a pattern with which to mark out the
new piece. In replacing broken rims or
felloes, spokes and shafts, a good deal of
the cutting-out work can be done with the
axe or hatchet and the adze, but care should
be taken to use the right kind of timber, and
to see that it is straight-grained and free
from knots.
For felloes and spokes, bluegum is gener-
ally used—in N. S. Wales, at least—split
from the log. Felloes can be bought sawn,
but they are not so liable to break if split
and cut to shape with the adze. Redgum
and narrow-leafed ironbark are also suit-
able. For shafts and poles the best wood is
spotted gum, which is also the best for
swinglebars; grey ironbark, yellow box and
lemon-scented gum are good substitutes.
First, cut out a slab of the right thickness,
lay your old shaft on that and mark out the
two sides. After adzing it down, finish
with plane and spokesliave, then mark the
holes that have to be bored. Timber for
these parts is usually sawn, but it can be
easily split.
Flooring and sides require sawn timber,
but these, too, can be replaced at home. For
heavy flooring nearly any kind of hardwood
suffices, and pine or beech is suitable for
light flooring and for the sides. Good sub-
stitutes are sassafras and white hazelwood.
The sides of a cart or dray will rattle to
pieces if the bolts are not kept tightened
up. When a bolt gets lost don’t replace it
with a bit of wire. Also keep the tyres
tight; a loose tyre damages spokes and
felloes.

RABBIT-DESTRUCTION COSTS.
“Rab”: Admittedly wire-netting is of the
first importance in controlling rabbits, but
wire-netting alone won’t destroy the pest.
There are netted holdings and paddocks to-
day alive with rabbits. Wire-netted or not,
a run can be kept free of rabbits, but with-
out wire-netting it’s a slavish, never-ending
job. From experience and keeping tab of
the costs I favor destroying rabbits in wire-
netted areas, where all timber harbor has
been dealt with, in the following preference:
(1) Digging- out the burrows and dogging,
ss. Gd. per acre.
(2) Ploughing out the burrows with road
plough and bullocks (provided there is bul-
lock feed on hand) and dogging, £2 10s. per
day, or 3s. 6d. per acre.
(3) Trapping with steel traps, followed
by damp straw charcoal fumigation, 2s. per
acre.
(4) Ditto with chemical fumigation, 2s.
per acre.
(5) Steel traps and filling in, 2s. per
acre.
In unnetted country the preference runs:
(1) Ordinary poison cart with phosphorus,
run once a month, 4d. per acre, or 4s. per
acre per annum.
(2) Thistleroot poisoning by ordinary
poison cart, once every three months, Bd. per
acre, or 2s. Bd. per acre per annum.
(3) Thistleroot poisoning, hand-laid, once
every three months, 9d. per acre.
DISTEMPER IN DOGS.
“V.S.M.”: Yets, in Australia and Maori-
land should soon be in possession of a re-
liable virus for protection against distemper
in dogs. After five years of hard work and
much expense, the research workers of the
“Field” Distemper Council have evolved a
treatment giving almost complete protection
if puppies are inoculated at about three
month's. The difficulty hitherto has been
that on the journey from England the virus
is apt to lose its potency, and there have
been many failures on this account. The
Wellcome Research Laboratories, which pre-
pare the vaccinating material, are concen-
trating on this problem with, they say, pros-
pect of early success.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
(1) What weight of soluble strychnine
must I mix with half a gallon of jam, or
other compound to make a poisonous bait
for rabbits? (2) What other poison can
I mix with jam for the same purpose, and
proportion necessary ? —4346.
(1) One drachm. (2) Arsenic loz., wash-
ing soda loz., water 1 pint. Boil until
arsenic is dissolved, and add half-gallon of
jam. Bury any sediment.
Names of suitable quiclc-growing trees and
shrubs to act as a breakwind in the Emma-
ville (N.S.W.) district? —4268.
Trees: Taxodium distichum, Eucalyptus
rubida, Gleditschia triancanthos, Salix Sac-
ramento, Populus robusta and Acacia elata.
Shrubs: Gupressus pisifera plumosa, Buxtis
sempervirens, Viburnum tinus, Escallonia
macrantha, Arbutus unedo and Juniperus
chinensis.
(1) In curing bacon what should be the
temperature of the curing-room? (2) How
can the curing-room be kept at an even tem-
perature ? —4441.
(1) 42 to 45 deg. Fahr., and it should
never exceed 60 deg. Curing should there-
fore only be conducted during the cooler
months of the year, preferably during frosty
weather. A humidity of 76 p.c. (per hydro-
meter) should be aimed at, and the light
should be dim. (2) Hanging moistened
sacks in the doorway or window spaed is
the usual method. A cellar makes the best
curing-room.
A consignment of bananas which I sent
from Queensland to Sydney suffered from a
disease called i ‘squirter, ,> so my agent said.
What is “squirter, ,> and how can it be
avoided? —4439.
The term means that the centre of the
fruit has turned to a soft watery mass which
will squirt out when pressed. Cause seems
to be connected with ripening and transport
methods, but has not yet been defined.
How to check brown scale on citrus trees?
j-4450.
In localities near the coast parasites of
the genera Aphycus cocophagus and Mus-
cidea have kept the scales down, but *in
other localities have not had the same effect.
The scale is most easily killed when the
majority of the scales are in the young
stage. The trees should then be fumigated
with hydrocyanic acid gas. A pamphlet on
the subject is obtainable from the N.S.W.
Agriculture Department. Spraying with
miscible oil also gives good results, 1 gallon
to 40 gallons of water being the usual
strength. The oil must be thoroughly mixed,
as any free oil may burn the foliage.
How to grow the choko? —4lsl.
Place the fruit in the soil with the seed-
end upwards. It should be well watered
and given plenty of climbing support in a
sunny position.
What are the chief provisions of the
N.S.W. Apiaries Act? —44s9.
All bees must be registered, whether kept
for private use or otherwise. When an apiary
is once registered no further registration is
necessary. Should an out-apiary be estab-
lished, however, application for registration
should be made, and should a beekeeper dis-
pose of his bees to another person or alter
the location of his apiary, the Department
of Agriculture must be notified. No fee is
required for registration. All apiarists must
keep their bees in frame hives, box hives
being prohibited. Any outbreak of disease
must be reported at once to the department.
I am growing half an acre of tulips annu-
ally. Bulbs develop well, but the brown
outer skins peel off, and buyers of bulbs
reject them. Is it due to some soil defi-
ciency? Remedy? —42ol.
It is due to harvesting the bulbs either
too early or too late. You must find by trial
the intermediate period when the bulbs can
be harvested without peeling. It has been
recently demonstrated by European growers
that this peeling is in no way detrimental
to the bulbs flowering, also that the peeling
is not due to any soil deficiency.
The Queensland Minister for Agriculture
claims that the Ms Bid. per bushel gross ,
equal to 2s. lOd. net , at which his Govern-
ment offered to fix the price of j.a.q. wheat
is the highest paid in any wheat-growing
country in the world. Is that correct? —
4438.
The Government offered 3s. 6|d. for wheat
of Q 1 milling quality delivered at the
grower’s station. It costs approximately
4Jd. per bushel (average) to transport
wheat from the station or siding to city
flour mills, making the cost at the mills
3s. lid. per bushel. The wheat of N.S.W.
growers, landed at Sydney Harbor, is quoted
at about 2s. 10$d. per bushel. It is claimed
that the “port” price in Q’land is the highest
available to farmers in any country in which
wheat is grown in sufficient quantity for
export.
(1) Means employed for producing re-
frigeration in a household freezer which docs
not use moving machinery? (2) Nature of
refrigerant ? —4366.
(1) and (2) A freezer, widely used in
England and on the Continent, which does
not employ moving machinery consists of a
small cylinder containing a solution ot
ammonia and water. Heat is applied, and
the ammonia is expelled from the solution
in gaseous form and then condensed to liquid
by external cooling. The liquid ammonia
enters an evaporator located in the cabinet,
and there evaporates to reduce temperature.
The now-gaseous ammonia passes into the
absorber, where it meets the water coming
from the boiler, and ammonia is absorbed
again by the water, which returns to the
boiler. Heating can be done by gas or oil.
Formula, for brewer's yeast? —4326.
Boil a handful of hops in one quart of
water for 20 minutes, or until the hops fall
to the bottom. Strain and cool. Blend three
tablespoons each of flour and sugar with a
little of the hop water, then stir all well
together. Bottle and tie down with new
corks. Stand in a warm place, when it will
be ready in 24 hours. For further lots, use
the, same bottle and cork.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Dimon”: When horses have been spelling
in the bush or in some distant paddock, comb
their manes and tails well before taking
them into the cultivation paddock. They
are often the means of carrying burrs and
other obnoxious seeds into clean fields.
“Gumblegubbin”: If flies are worrying the
plough or team horses rub a little patent
axle-grease round the eyes when they are
being harnessed in the morning. Castor oil
and olive oil are also good.
“Wrash”; When the horse’s hair curls
the wrong way and he will not feed, but
keeps roaming aimlessly about the paddock,
suspect bots. Starve him for 24 hours.
Then drench him with a mixture of one pint
raw linseed oil and a wineglassful of turpen-
tine. Still without feed, four hours later,
give him another drench of 2 quarts warmed
milk. Then chase him out to the greenest
paddock available.
“Floodmark”: If your galvanised-iron
tank springs a leak when it’s full of water,
try throwing about three pints of fresh
cement into the tank; it stops the leak till
the tank can be mended. I saved a 1000-
gallon tank full of rain-water this way.
“Mulgo”: If the well water begins to taste
a bit off, it is a sign that it is becoming
stagnant for want of light and air. To pre-
vent that, pump up a couple of buckets of
water first thing each morning and pour
them back into the well. The fall and agi-
tation of the water will aerate it.
“Deekay”: Make a cover for the seed
drill by sewing old wheat-bags edge to edge.
Waterproof it with a dressing of crank-case
oil. If this is kept with the drill during
the sowing season it will save the annoy-
ance of finding the fertiliser and seed wet
from an unexpected shower overnight.
“Dimon”: Old motor Wheels, without the
tyres, serve well for handcarts and low
trucks for roughing about the farm. I saw
a pair used for breaking-in young horses to
harness. The axle was a piece of hardwood;
long sapling shafts and a board for the
driver to stand on completed the turnout.
They are also useful, mounted on two slotted
uprights, for running out coils of wire.
“Pine Scrub”: Eucalyptus oil, I have
found, mixed in equal parts with kerosene or
a light mineral oil, is an excellent dressing
for fly-blown sheep and for lambs at mark-
ing.
“Bufforp”: Dams and swamps are not
necessary for ducks. All they need is a tin
of clean drinking water, deep enough for
them to immerse their heads in to clear their
nostrils. They like a swim perhaps every
week or so, but that’s not essential. Too
much' -water means loss of condition and
loss of eggs.
“Odd Job”: You can still find poultry
farms where infertile and unhatched eggs
are destroyed by the hundred. Yet pigs
will fatten on them.
“A.C.8.”: Much parsnip seed is lost
through neglect to firm the beds. Rows can
be firmed after planting by laying a board
along them and walking on it. Seed should
never be planted deep. If the weather is
very dry a light cover of, say, small tea-
tree branches will help the seed come
through, but it must be removed before it
makes the young plants spindly and weak.
“Sylvester”; Buy that beehive in the flat,
and prime with good paint all dovetails and
joints before putting them together. This
will add years to the life of the hive.
“Yarri” : When putting on galvanised-iron,
paint the underparts, especially the bottom
ends, where they lap over another sheet.
These are the parts that rust through quickly
if not so treated, while the rest of the iron
remains good for years after.
“Salmon Gums”: “Buckwong” drew atten-
tion to the possibilities of irrigation on
small farms (B. 16/11/’33). A Westralian
I know has nine acres under sprinklers.
During the past twelvemonth he has grown
about 50,000 cauliflowers and 200,000 lettuce
—he had five acres going 40,000 or so to the
acre. In addition, he cropped 22 acres with
potatoes, averaging about nine tons. Esti-
mating the caulis. at 151 b. each and the let-
tuce at fib., he produced something like 580
tons, excluding several acres of catch-crops
ploughed in. About 50,000 gallons of water
(supplied from springs) is used per day
throughout the summer.

Information Sought.
When did Australian troops first go into
action during the Great War? A candid
friend says they didn’t come in till the war
was half over. —4389.
Australian troops captured German New
Guinea 38 days after England had declared
war upon Germany. Within nine months of
the outbreak —on April 25, 1915 —Australian
troops landed on Gallipoli. By July, 1910,
they were lighting in France and about the
same time commenced lighting in Sinai and
Palestine. Incidentally, the percentage of
casualties to numbers engaged was greater
for Australia than for any other part of
the Empire.
The chance of a ticket in “a certain lot-
tery” winning the first prize is 1 in 100,000.
But there are 99,001 numbers above 999,
so that it would seem that the three-figure
tickets or those smaller have considerably
less chance of winning first prize than those
of the other group, and that five-figure
tickets, which are nine times as numerous as
all others , should give the holder most con-
fidence. What’s the fallacy in the reasoning?
• —4265.
You’ve supplied the answer in your first
sentence. Every ticket having an equal
chance of winning first or any prize, it
follows that the number printed on it doesn’t
affect the matter. It would be quite pos-
sible to devise a system of numbering by
combined letters and figures in which the
number of characters identifying the ticket
would be the same in every case.
(1) Suitable mixture of raw and boiled
oil, together icit% color, which, when dried,
will give a dark-red or brown, and quan-
tity required to give two coats to a weather-
board building 33 ft. x 12 ft. x 10 ft.? (2)
Method of removing whitewash or water-
paint from weatherboard walls ( inside ) to
prepare them for painting? —4342.
(1) It would be better to use raw oil.
Two gallons would be sufficient for two
cOats. Use 71b. of high-grade red oxide to
obtain the dark-red, and add black to give
a brown. For the first coat, use half-pint
turps to the gallon. For a drier use tere-
bine, half-pint to the gallon of linseed oil.
(2) Remove it by washing, and allow the
walls to dry before painting.
v My cockatoo, about 18 months old, does
not get his feathers. They seem to be de-
cayed at the roots and fall out. I feed him
on wheat, lettuce and sometimes fruit? —-
4373.
The bird appears to be suffering from a
feather disease, probably incurable, but you
can try dressing the affected parts with
an antiseptic oil. A chemist could advise
you what to use.
(1) Can a married woman in Vic. vote
under her maiden name? ' (2) Can she re-
tain her maiden name on the electoral roll?
(3) Can she submit her income-tax form in
her maiden name? —43l3;
(1) Yes, if she is enrolled under it. (2)
Yes. (3) The married name is the legal
name for the purposes of an income-tax
return.
I am planning a small cool room (for
butcher) to be used in connection with an
electric refrigerator. Best material for walls,
thickness and method of insulation? —4lB6.
Build walls of single brick about 6in.
mwi.’ w hen these are thoroughly dry
n! 1 i ie s & acc with P umice insulation, rammed
hard. The outer wall should be stuccoed
against damp. The ceiling should be of double
timber, insulated with tlie same thickness of
.pumice. If pumice is too expensive, cork is
next best, but it must be very dry and well
rammed. Sawdust is always liable to pick
up damp and deteriorate; if it must be used,
it should be all one timber, preferably one of
the clean pines.
A machine was advertised recently by a
Sydney firm, and I forwarded an order for
one, with cheque, a month ago. Beyond ac-
knowledgment of the money nothing was sent.
Any way to recover the money without be-
coming further involved financially? —423o.
Write to the firm demanding delivery
within a stated time. If not then delivered
you can take action for non-delivery, claim-
ing damages.
Ho to is the effect of old tooled vellum or
parchment for expensive bags and bookbind-
ings secured with ordinary fine-grade
leather? I wish to bind some books wnth
that sort of old ivory finish. —4263.
Better treat the leather first and do the
binding afterwards. First give it a coat of
flexible varnish of the sort employed for
patent-leather shoes, and when dry apply
one or more coats of white-oil paint in
which enough ochre has been mixed to give
it a warm ivory cream. Tool the design on
with gravers, and with a fine brush and a
little Vandyke brown touch up the fine lines
and dots of the tooling with the brown.
This requires a light touch if a good antique
look is to result. When dry the entire sur-
face of the leather should be given one or
two coats of clear varnish. If too shiny
rub gently with a very fine sandpaper until
the right surface is obtained.
How to stencil a light color on to a dark
fabric by the acid-bleach process? —427o.
Pin tlie stencil to the material and .stencil
with a mixture made of loz. tartaric acid, 40gr.
pure gum and loz. of water. Blotting-paper
is placed beneath the fabric being treated,
and the brush must be only lightly charged
with the mixture or it will run. When the
stencil is lifted the fabric will still look as
before, and must be hung out to dry. After
drying place in a tub containing a bleach
composed of lib. chloride of lime to lgal.
of water. A few minutes of this solution
will bleach the pattern to a light shade, and
the longer it i.s left in the bath the paler
will the pattern bleach. Remove from bleach
and dip material in a bath of soap and
water. If the material is one which will
stand boiling, the pattern will be sharpened
by it and look very fine. When dry it should
be pressed on the back with a warm iron.
The bleach will be found to also affect the
color of the body of the fabric to a certain
extent. Yellow-green silk ’treated in this
way shows a creamy pattern on a coppery
background, the acid fusing a certain amount
of blue tint into most colors with surprising
and often most artistic effects.
(1) Can rosella parrots be caught by
looped horsehair; if so, how? (2) Is soak-
ing wheat in whisky and letting the parrots
feed on it a good method? —4267.
(1) They can be caught that way, but
there must be a “call bird” alongside. One
of the most common methods is to put seed
inside a box and let the door fall when the
birds go inside. Usual practice is to catch
the birds by netting. (2) This practice is
against the law and must not be adopted.
I understand Newton’s theory of gravita-
tion is no longer accepted. What is the
new theory, and how does it compare with
the 01d?— 4309.
We are not aware that any physicist of
standing rejects the fundamentals of New-
ton’s theory. Einstein and other relativists
have suggested modifications of it, but these
are based on hypotheses which are still the
subject of controversy.
What is a chloride-free diet and in what
class of diseases is it used? —4380.
A diet prepared, cooked and eaten without
salt. Foods are selected containing the mini-
mum of inorganic salts, and no salt is added
either in the cooking or as a condiment.
Used in the treatment of chronic kidney
disease, dropsy, heart diseases and persistent
diarrhoea.
(1) Where can I obtain a small planing
or tongue and grooving machine for use with
a circular saw? (2) Approximate cost? —
43 1 6.
(1) McPherson, Bathurst-street, Sydney.
Dimension sketch should be forwarded show-
ing width of face to be planed and diameter of
spindle of saw-bench. There must be suffi-
cient room on the end of the spindle to take
the cutter block. (2) About £4 10s.
Position of Irish ( Southern ) horn resi-
dents of Australia in the event of the Irish
Free State becoming a Republic? Would
they become aliens here? —4306.
It would not affect the status of persons
born in Ireland previous to the. establishment
of a Republic. Having been born subjects
of the King they and their children would
remain such, and no Act of an Irish Repub-
lic could be made applicable to them.
If I engage a man to drive me regularly
in his own car around the city in the course
of my business, must I insure him under the
N.S.W. Workers' Compensation Act? —4275.
If a contract of service creating a rela-
tionship of master and servant exists be-
tween you and the cardriver, it will be neces-
sary for you to effect a policy under the Act.
(1) Essential points of difference between
1924 Chevrolet and previous model? (2)
Clearance to valve tappets in each model?
—4300.

I have been acting as co-trustec under the
will of a friend , and wish to resign my trus-
teeship. How can I do so with as little cost
to the estate as possible? —4343.
Make a formal renunciation. It need not
be under seal but should be drawn up by a
solicitor. The cost would be paid by you
personally and not defrayed out of the estate.
Whether you should be allowed to withdraw
or not is a matter in the discretion of the
Court.
What are the grounds for divorcing a tvife
in Queensland? —4360.
Adultery; desertion without cause con-
tinuously for five years or upwards; lunacy,
as proved by detention in an institution for
five years within six years immediately pre-
ceding the filing of the petition.
(1) How to test a car generator? (2)
Books on subject? (3) Composition of
hydraulic-brake fluid ? —4334.
(1) Running the generator as a motor is
a quick method of determining its condi-
tion. In this system, the current and volt-
age delivered are measured by an ammeter
and voltmeter, and the speed of rotation by
a speed indicator. (2) Dyke’s “Automobile
and Gasoline Engine Encyclopaedia.” (3)
The Lockheed system employs a fluid con-
sisting of one part denatured alcohol and
one part castor oil chemically pure. In
extremely low temperatures the alcoholic
content is raised.
Who was “poor silly old Debs,” men-
tioned in II- L. Mencken's “Notes on Demo-
cracy,” and for what offence was he im-
prisoned ?• —4234.
Eugene Victor Debs was an American
Labor leader, who worked during his early
years as a locomotive engineer. He sat in
the Indiana State Legislature and while
president of the Amalgamated Railway
Union won a strike on the Great Northern
Railway. He joined the Socialists in 1897
and was Socialist candidate for President on
five different occasions. From 1914 he edited
the “National Rip-Saw,” St. Louis. In
1918, being opposed to the war, he was sen-
tenced to 10 years’ imprisonment for
obstructing recruiting. It was during his
incarceration that he was for a fifth time
nominated for President. He was released
in 1921 and died in 1926 at 71.
Where did Jimmy Wilde and Pancho Villa
fight, and in what year? Which round was
Wilde defeated in, and was he knocked out?
—4296.
At the New York polo grounds on June
18, 1923. Wilde was knocked out in the
seventh round.
(1) How are delegates elected to the Aus-
tralian Cricket Board of Control? (2) What
powers and functions are incorporated in
the board's constitution? —4293.
(1) They arc elected by the State asso-
ciations, Victoria, N.S.W. and S. Australia
each having three delegates, Queensland two
and Tasmania and Westralia each one. (2)
They include the arrangement, control, regu-
lation and financing of visits of English or
other teams to Australia and of Australian
teams to England or elsewhere and the con-
trol of representative trial matches in Aus-
tralia in which cricketers of more than two
States are engaged. It is also empowered
to alter, amend or add to the Laws of
Cricket in Australia, either in conjunction
with the Marylebone C. C. or otherwise, and
it approves, registers and appoints umpires
for matches played in Australia.
What is the opinion of the medical pro-
fession as to the suitability of North Queens-
land for hard-working white men? —4365.
The subject was thoroughly discussed at
the Australian Medical Congress of 1920,
and the opinion of the medical practitioners
present was overwhelmingly in favor of
the suitability of North Queensland for the
successful implantation of a working white
race.
Hilaire Belloc recently wrote of Napo-
leon’s abode at St. Helena: “It was a
shanty of a house, most suitable for com-
mon stables.” J. G. Lockhart’s version was:
“Two months were spent in additions and
repairs. His house was (except that of the
Governor) the best on the island." What
are the facts?— 42B6.
Belloc probably takes his cue from W. H.
Hudson, who described Bonaparte’s abode
as “a small, damp, ramshackle, rat-infested
place, badly situated.” Still Hudson says
Napoleon had billiards, and was kept plenti-
fully supplied with books.
(1) How is wax inlaying done? , (2)
What tools shall I need to inlay small
articles, such as trays, jewel-cases, etc.? (3)
How are colors used? —4226.
(1) and (2) The design is traced with
carbon paper on to the wooden article to
be decorated, and cut out with vee tools and
gouges to a reasonable depth, after which
the work is varnished. The filling, made
from wax, resin and whatever dry color is
required, melted together, is placed in the
grooves while still soft. A small piece of
wood, such as a wooden modelling tool, is
used to fill the design tracts. (3) Each
color is put jn separately and allowed to
dry (approximate time for drying, half an
hour) before an adjoining color is inserted,
or they may run into one another. Trim
the scuffs eh -when 7 finished with a steel
scraper. V

MEN AMONG
PEARLS
By
H. Brake -Brockman
Synopsis : Christopher Kent, who has
been turned down by his cousin Lattice
on account of his poverty, comes to the
Broome pearling grounds, hoping to
make quick money and return to her.
June Goer, daughter of another
pearler, is greatly interested hi Chris;
but it is young Peter Fordyce, a
ivealthy pearler, and not Chris, who is
interested in June. A letter from Lat-
tice brightens Chris, but he fails to
notice her references to a new male
friend. Chris, whose affairs have not
been going well, loses his diver
through paralysis.—a heavy blow.
Peter Fordyce proposes to june, but
she staves him off; and Peter turns
enthusiastically to a new scheme for
pooling pearl-shell. Goer alone amongst
the masten'-pearlers stands out of the
scheme, and June is upset by the ill-
feeling that follows. Chris, disturbed by
hearing that he and his partner are
heavily in debt to Fordyce, considers
putting the rest of his money into a
cattle-run owned by Ryce and Munro.
Friends warn him —too late—of the
character of these men. m Chris, reading
English papers, sees ‘the announce-
ment of Lettice’s marriage, and begins
to drink heavily. He again puts out
to sea. Queenie, a young girl with
whom June has been friendly, wears
a very fine string of pearls, and it is
rumored that Goer gave them to her.
Shocked by what she has heard of her ,
father’s relations with the girl, June
sends for her.
CHAPTER XVII ( Continued .)
JUNE did not know how long she
crouched there alone on the verandah.
It seemed an age of time; it was an age
of time in the growdh of her ego. Phy-
sically she felt numbed, until the sound of
a foot scrunching the white beach-shingle
of the bungalow path threw her into an
ague. She trembled violently as she heard
the lattice door pushed open and Queenie’s
light, cheerful voice call out: “You there,
June? Mum said you wanted me.”
For one moment June wished she had
not sent for the girl; for one moment she
hesitated. Something shy and weak within
her shrank back, clutched desperately at the
dissolving wisps of her vision of life, cried
that it were better to bind her eyes for
ever with their poor remnants than face she
knew not what of truth. Auntie Miriam
still seemed to think
But Queenie was knocking. June pushed
the hair from her forehead, and rose. What
was the use of further pretence? She would
not give in to her inhibitions; the other
half of her nature clamored for assurance,
bade her face the world whatever it might
hold. Life! All her youth, all her vitality,
all that zest in her which was a direct in-
heritance from her father, her very eager-
ness, had been but a constant urge towards
what she felt she had so foolishly regarded
as a mountain of romance, and had just
discovered to be a vortex.
She stood there pushing her fair hair aside,
very young and childish-looking. But in
that moment she grew up; she had found
that life did not turn out as you expected—
you could not do as you pleased with life.
She was caught by it; she was helpless. She
need not be craven.
Yet it was a veiy shaky girl who let
Queenie in. She looked for the pearls.
They were there, a gleaming halter about
the neck of her friend.
“June!” cried Queenie, rushing at her.
“Whatever is up with you? You look dread-
ful! Have you gone and got the dengue?”
June drew back just a little self-con-
sciously. “No,” she said,' “I haven’t.
Queenie, I” She stopped, at a loss for
words. This matter, always so lightly
skimmed over and round in her own mind,
was not easy to put into spoken words.
Her pale cheeks suffused with painful red.
She turned away, began fiddling with a
magazine lying open on one of the cane
tables, and went on without raising her eyes.
“They all say Dad gave you those pearls,
Queenie. They say—oh, you know what
they say! Is it true?”
Her cry was a plea for denial. When no
answer came she looked up. The other
girl stood; quite still; a strange little smile
curling her lips, in her eyes the contempt
and envy which ever seems to be the por-
tion of her kind.
June was answered. In one illuminating
flash she understood trifles which had per-
plexed her, remarks, smiles and reactions of
Queenie which until then had remained
without meaning.
“Queenie!” she exclaimed.
Queenie had just made up her mind that
of course June must be calmed and the
matter laughed aside. But the horror, the
misery, what she wrongly imagined to be
the contumely in June’s voice incensed her.
At the moment June’s feelings were too
outraged for thought of reproach to enter
her mind.
Queenie it was who sprang instantly to
arms—June was asking for all she would
get! She shrugged.
“You can think as you like,” she retorted
rudely.
Her words fell on June like a blow. “I
don t want to think at all, she muttered.
“That’s why I had to ask you. I simply
“No, you never can!” interrupted
Queenie scornfully, by now thoroughly irri-
tated. She knew quite well that she should
be telling June that if she wished to be as
dirty-minded as the rest she was welcome—
she knew quite well that that would bring
her loyalty fighting to the front. But the
impulse of the moment proved too strong
a goad, too tempting by far the opportunity
to prick what privately she termed June’s
smug prudery. “Well,' what’ll you do if I
tell you it’s all, every tiny little bit of it,
as true as— pearls themselves?”
June did nothing, said nothing. She stood
motionless, until at last Queenie, unable to
put up with her silence, flung into a torrent
of gibing words. Only then, when she could
gain a moment’s hearing, did June sa.y, cold
as ice: “I think you had better go now.”
“Go? Kick me out, eh? What’ll you say
to Goer when he comes in?”
June winced. Goer—her father. And
Queenie! She knew she never wanted to
set eyes on the girl again, yet it was against
the man that her anger mounted. How
dare he let her be friends, when all the
. ti me :—it was sickening! Her father—and
Queenie! People just didn’t do such things,
Yet it appeared they did. There stood
Queenie, solid and real, and she said
“When?” began June.
“Oh, ages ago! I suppose you want the
whole story now? What he said; what I
said; how”
“No! No! But—was it before I came
to Broome?” .
“Oh, yes.” ,
To June that made matters doubly worse.
Her father had almost encouraged the
friendship, yet all the time they were
carrying on this—this intrigue. In that
moment June forgave her mother for the
long years during whmh she had stifled a
heart-ache, finding it strange m her to leave
so caie ossly a little daughter, the babies
who needed her ove-perhaps Goer had

young agony could make a woman forgive
that! Yet this was almost more loathsome.
Her father-well, Queenie was only a year
older than herself, quite young enough to
be his daughter!
T ,, , , a
June was tortured and flayed by the lash
of uncompromising youth, the keen edge of
inexperience. She felt sick. Her father!
and then her whirling thoughts were
drenched in tears.
“Go away, oh go away and leave me
alone,” she sobbed. “I feel sick. You are
disgusting.”
“Oh, am I?” retorted Queenie, stung.
“You want to live in a world all to your-
self, you’re too nice for this one! It’s just
as well everyone hasn’t got your ideas—
they might sound all right in a book, but
in life- Most people are ready enough
for a bit of sport, thank Heaven!”
“Sport?” June’s voice quavered, a faint
ghost.
“Oh, you’re out for a grand passion, aren’t
you? You think you’ve got one, too, don’t
you? For Chris Kent? Well, d’you
imagine he’s any better than the rest?
D’you know where I’ve seen him going
night after night, past our house? Down
on the beach with that Ivy from the Buc-
caneer Arms! I suppose you think he only
goes for a walk to talk about the price of
shell? Gammon! That’s your precious
Chris for you! All men are the same, June,
you take it from me, and the sooner you
find out and get over being so squeamish
the better for you. You asked me once if
I ever got all I wanted, and I told you
only when I went after it. Well, I make
the men get me the things I want—look at
these pearls. I want a good time—and I
jolly-well get it! And believe me, it’s the
only way!”
“Please go.”
“All sight, I’m
going. I suppose
you won’t tell
anybody Mrs.
Tweedie would be
awfully bucked if
you did. But,
after all, we’re
friends, June, and
Goer’s your
father.”
“That’s what’s
so ghastly. Oh,
Queenie,” shud-
dered June, “how
could you?” Her
voice was the wail of ravished virginity,
Queenie stared at her curiously. Most of
the elder girl’s anger and pique had dis-
persed in the satisfaction of for once thor-
ouglily shocking June. Suddenly she beheld
pathos and tragedy in the shaking shoulders
of the girl she had grown really to like:
June had believed in her implicitly—she
had enjoyed that, even though such faith
amused her.
“If it had been one of the bank-boys or
_ o r somebody young, perhaps I might have
—have—tried to understand,” sobbed June.
“I never want to see you again!”
“I’m off,” retorted Queenie, and went,
She did not, just then, feel capable of ex-
plaining to June that Captain Goer’s prac-
tised love-making was infinitely more
exciting than the kisses of the bank-boys.
CHAPTER XVIII.
Mr. Montgomery Takes a Hand.
n ± A/r u/r
Ca P t! : m ° oer s ™Sge re d into Mr. Mont-
gomery’s office. He had come to ask a
and because he prided himself on
never doing such a thing his manners grew
more than usually aggressive. He sat talk-
mg for some time, twisting about on the
Monty gave him until it looked as
d dai c^ s , 1U reak beneath the
convolutions of his big frame. He roared
adoi i d Peter Fordyce and the Vandervelde
shell-scheme until Monty longed to argue,
P om t ol }t. the good thereof, even m
du ' ect opposition to his own interests. But
Captain came to the point, and
Monty paused in the very act of lighting
k * s pipe,
“Seen June this last day or two?”
demanded her father,
“No.”
“Neither have I,” came the startling
reply. “At least.... She’s practically shut
herself up in her room, Monty. Lies there
all day in the dark, and only says ‘Yes’
or ‘No’ when I try to rouse her. What
rot! But short of going in and forcibly
dragging her out, I can’t do anything. Oh,
there’s no need to stare at me like that!
Of course I know what’s up. She’s found
cut what she. chooses to think the most
dreadful and shocking things about her
Dad! That’s the devil of these good
women—though heaven knows I’d wring
the neck of anybody who ever dared to
say a word out of place to June! It all
happened when I was out shooting at
Taylor’s. She’d hardly look at me when
I got home; it didn’t take much to see
she was whipping herself to sit down at
the same table and be frigidly polite.
Went on like that for twenty-four hours.
No good to me. So I went for her, and
after a lot of shilly-shally ran the trouble
to earth. My God, we had a scene!”
The scene had been entirely on the Cap-
tain > s side> though he did not
seem aware
of it . Left to herself, June might have
regained in part her poise. But he goaded
her to confession of her knowledge; and
the more he had talked a * d cursed and
persuaded , the less she had found to say .
At last she ran from him into her bed-
room, flung herself face-down upon the pil-
lo and sobbed t shuddering s £ bg
>• 1 , , ,i f, j
droV r e _ her fa * her ’ who kad fo
f h e r ?°“- Goe £ could not
stand the sight of suffering. He was no
saclist. lie went his way not caring on
whom he tramp i ed , but he liked to im J gine
he trampled on no one.
, , , , JO „ . ,
What has she heard, asked Mr. Mont-
r' ~ • m,
, About Queenie. Then I m damned if
she d,dn 1 send for her > and the Ilttle slut
gave the whole show away! That’s the
end of Queenie—anybody can have her
now! . I>ve told her so - Gan y° u imagine
ker ke m§ such a fool? ’
Youth, thought Monty—impatient, reck-
less, determined to hit back, though it
suffer most in the hitting. If only June
had sent for him instead of Queenie!
He looked hard at the Captain. Goer
was worried, for all his show of annoy-
ance - Monty rightly guessed, with a sen-
sation of satisfaction, that the swaggering
P ride . of him did not find it at all pleasant
to v l ew the spectacle he knew he must
inevitably present in his daughter’s eyes:
no man, however gross, cares to face his
e g° through the eyes of a hurt and disillu-
sioned child.
“Can’t you say anything, man?” roared
Goer.
“I could say plenty. Queenie’s not the
only fool! You were asking for this, Goer,
when you fetched June up here and didn’t
Quit playing round with that girl. But
it’s not much use going over that now.
What do you want me to do?”
“Well, I reckoned you and June seemed
great cobbers—oh, you’re a sly old dog,
Monty, and if I hadn’t known the.kid re-
garded you as a kind of grandfather”-
“Cut that out!” Monty rasped. “D’you
want me to come round?”
“That’s the idea.”
“And kid her that dad’s a plaster saint?”
“Tell her anything you damned well like,
but stop this hysterical racket. It gets
on my nerves; it’s almost as bad as having
a corpse in the house, blinds down, all tip-
toeing about. And it’ll be all round the
town in.a day or two more.”
“A sensible woman would be better,”
murmured Monty. “If only Sophie”
A shadow obliterated the patch of sun-
light thrown from the door. Both men
looked up. Peter Fordyce hesitated for
an instant at sight of the Captain, but he
came in and stood glaring.
“ ’Morning, Monty,” he said curtly. “I
see you’re busy.”
Goer rose, gruff and bristling. - “How
about it, Monty—are you coming?”
“Yes. In a moment. Call back for me
in half—no, on second thoughts, you
needn’t worry; I’ll just slip along the first
minute I can.”
Goer went out; his departure lightened
the room of more than his belligerent
frame. Peter rushed into speech. He had
rung up June half a dozen times during
the last few' days, and the wretched Jap
who answered the ’phone only said she was
ill. In bed, he gathered. He had called
—the same answer. He had inquired dis-
creetly round the town, but the doctor
knew nothing of it, neither did anybody
else. In the end he had got hold of
Queenie. From her he had wormed the
truth. Did Monty know? What was Goer
doing here? Queenie had been very bitter
about June. He was nearly demented:
had Monty ever heard of anjdhing worse?
What was he to do?
He marched round the room, lit cigar-
ette after cigarette and threw them all
away. He had not exaggerated: he felt
nearly demented at thought of June lying
alone in a darkened room fighting a dark
battle. And yet he had no inkling of what
Queenie alone guessed: that June had been
dragged to the depths of desolation, that
she lay face to face with despair.
“Go to her, Monty,” pleaded Peter.
“She’s terribly fond of you. Surely you
can make the poor kid realise that it’s not
the end- of the world.”
He told Monty then that he had per-
suaded his mother to go round. Mr. Mont-
gomery raised his eyebrows and ran a hand
over the bare crown of his head. Imagine
Sophie Fordyce going to Goer’s house!
She had vowed years ago she would never
go there again, she who had been such a
friend of June’s mother. And to go on
such a mission, too —Monty wondered if
she had trembled on the step, with a fear
out of the long-dead past making her
breath catch: old Johnnie Fordyce had
told him once she had never been able
quite to forget This must have brought
back many things. But she had gone—
because her beloved son asked it of her.
Monty, curious, inquired what had hap-
pened.
“Toko said June was asleep,” replied
Peter. “Mother peeped in—it was this
morning I took her, when I knew Goer was
down here—and she said the poor child
looked far too worn-out to waken. And
she wouldn’t stay a minute. You know
how she loathes the Captain. She might
go again—but somehow I can’t ask her,
Monty. I know she hated it. She was
dreadfully upset. Anything—anything like
this always does upset her.”
Peter’s face grew red. Monty wondered
if by any chance he knew that tale of long-
past happenings in Cossack Creek, but
decided he did not: the young fellow was
only troubled by .recollection of some past
escapade of his own which had come to
his mother’s ears.
He reached for his coat on the nail be-
hind, and found the old battered topee.
“You can run me down now,” he said to
Peter, “and we’ll see if she’s awake.”
June heard Mr. Montgomery’s step on
the verandah, his deep voice asking if he
might come in. She reached for her
kimono, then shrank back. She wanted
most dreadfully to see him, and yet
He rattled the door-handle. “Coming
ready or not,” he cried, just as the child-
ren called when he listened to them play-
ing round the hotel. The door opened
and he passed in, stooping his tall body,
fumbling and uncertain in the dim light.
“What’s the meaning of this?” he
demanded. “At eleven o’clock in the morn-
ing”—
“Monty!” cried June, and the next
moment she was crying in his arms, soft
hair caressing his lips, bare shoulders shak-
ing against the solid breadth of his chest.
He let her cry for a time before he
shook her gently. Then he dragged forth
the whole story right down to the last
festering torment of Queenie’s sneering re-
marks about Christopher Kent. “What’s
the good of anything, now Monty?” she
sobbed. “I never want to see anybody
again. I feel as though I just can’t face
Dad at all—now we both know'. It’s'
horrible.”
“My child,” said Monty very firmly,
“you’ve just got to realise that lots of
horrible things happen in life—much more
horrible than this—and that nothing’s
gained by worrying over them. I certainly
think your dad was—well, stupid, to say
the least of it. But look here, June, you
don’t hate me, do you?”
' “No” ;
“And yet I’ve told you”

“That’s different. You may have had
lots of—of love affairs, Uncle Monty, but
I’m quite sure you never hurt anybody.
I mean—oh, this is different, that’s all.
No, thought Monty, he hadn’t hurt any-
body—at least he didn’t think he had. He
had felt glad or sad at the end of each
affair, but he had always tried to have no
regrets and to leave none. He rather
thought he had succeeded, but you never
could tell. He had certainly never been
a coarse and clumsy fool like Goer! Yet
now he would have to let him down lightly.
“No,” he said, “it’s not different—very. I
was only always a little cleverer; and, of
course, I didn’t have a daughter to con-
sider. Your dad’s been clumsy. He’s very
sorry, I can tell you.”
“And Queenie?” The bitterness of her
soft voice made Monty wince.
“Oh, she’s just that sort. She can’t help
it. Don’t be too hard, June.”
“And—Chris?”
Monty hesitated. Delicate ground here,
he thought. “You don’t know,” he tem-
porised. “And you mustn’t think people
utterly damned because”
“But Auntie Miriam always said only
beastly people”
Damn Auntie! She shouldn’t have let
June come to Broome if she wished her
to go through life in swaddling clothes!
It was a case of gloves off up here. “Does
she think it beastly to get married?” he
demanded. “I thought you called your-
self a modern girl, my child, and had no
time for what you termed cotton-wool?
Do you remember that day you asked me
to tell you about Sophie Fordyce?”
“Yes.”
“Do you still like her?”
“I think she’s lovely.”
“Well, she didn’t let life get her down.
She had a terrible experience when she
was younger than you by a good deal. She
was actually sold to a man, and then John
Fordyce came along and rescued her. And
when she found that he had fallen in love
with her, she didn’t lose her head as you’re
doing, she managed to love him back, even
though he had a wife at the time. And
see how happy she has been. You couldn’t
have found a more devoted pair. But they
weren’t married to start with, and I sup-
pose Auntie would call her horrid. It’s
no good running away and hiding, June.
Much better to- face things and just try
not to let them hurt too badly. We all
love the moon, but when we find that it is
only made of green cheese”
“Don’t, don’t, Uncle Monty! I can’t
bear it!”
“Then don’t. Get up and beat it. Damn
everybody. Then go and find something
you can laugh at. Some day you will
smile at yourself.”
“Don’t!” June beat the sheets with her
hands. “Don’t!” She turned and buried
her face in the pillow. *
“Poor little girl,” Monty thought, “only
when you are very young can the bottom
fall out of everything.” Then: “Very
well,” he said; “we won’t talk like that
any more.”
They sat in silence, Monty’s long fingers
slithering softly over her bright hair. He
loved the feel of it.
What a blind fool Chris Kent must be!
He had, generally, to Monty’s surprise,
shown a complete indifference to women;
yet here he was messing about with one of
the barmaids when June.... Rage against
Queenie enveloped Monty. Talk was a
dangerous weapon; she should have learnt
to hold her tongue by this time. Oh
women—even the youngest of them made
life so complicated!
He remembered June on that morning
when he had first beheld her grown-up.
The freshness, the eagerness, the zest of
her! Never to be the same again He
sighed. Then for a moment he wondered
what would come out of this, and specu-
lated if, for all their smart talk, the girls
of to-day were any less romantic and inno-
cent than their grandmothers. Innocence
was too often confused with ignorance—
girls had a way of knowing facts and yet
in a mysterious way remaining, as it were,
unaware of them. More complications!
He came to the conclusion that it was not
so much the centuries as individual tem-
peraments which made the differences.
Always there had been Queenies, always
Junes. Amusing, alluring, diverting
Queenie; but the man who could capture
June, with her warm passion for life and
her starry idealisms, could surely ask no
more! His Emily had been one of the
diverting, inconsequent sort, though she
had been more ignorant than June when
first they were married. Perhaps if
What rot was this, what nonsense was he
thinking? Old fool, gs if there were any
comparison! He was getting as mad as
the rest. Time he got out of Broome for a
spell and time June made a break, too.
As though in answer to his unspoken
thought, June said: '
“I want to go away, Uncle Monty. Dad
says he will take me. But I can’t go with
him. I just can’t.” She could not tell
even Uncle Monty that she was ashamed
of her father, knew she would feel a
shudder of sickness sweep over her each
time she beheld him speak to a girl. He
had talked and joked with so many on
their last voyage together, and she' had
imagined he was taking a fatherly interest,
indeed, she had thought at all,
“And I don’t want to go back to Auntie
Miriam much either,” she murmured.
“Same applies to me, I suppose?” he
asked.
“You?”
“I’m off to Melbourne in a week or two.;
Suppose we see if Dad will let you come
with me? You could stay with Mary
until you felt equal to Auntie.”
“Uncle Monty 1” Her voice rose to his
ears with the incredible relief, the dawning
hope of a bushed wayfarer answering the
first faint coo-ee of rescue. In her heavy
eyes he imagined he beheld a dim spark
kindle.
June had heard much of Mary, Monty’s
niece, her good-fellow of a husband, her
two imps of children. If only she could
get right away from everybody she knew,
escape curious eyes, delude her stabbed
heart into belief that she no longer cared
for Chris, put herself beyond reach of
Peter, whose passionate letter imploring her
to marry him, to let him take her away, lay
crushed out of sight beneath her pillow!
Peter had not destroyed that letter, but he
would have been wiser if he had. In her
revulsion June shrank from the ardent out-
pourings: she could trace too well the track
of the snake which had crawled into her
life and poisoned it.
It was settled. They began to make
plans, to talk of catching the next boat
South if possible. Monty was delighted;
he felt his spirits bound youthfully at
thought of Melbourne—they would go to
the Cup; they would have a wonderful
time.
June sat up and swung her bare legs to
the floor, toes searching for slippers. She
looked at Monty, her whole being flooded
with thankfulness for him. And she man-
aged a tremulous smile because she knew
he’d like it. “And you will be sure to in-
troduce me to all the best people, Uncle
Monty?”
Monty stood up. He stretched out his
hands and pulled her to her feet. Into his
heart poured a dancing wave of delight.
He exulted. She’d do! She’d shown her
mettle; she was not going to-give in. She’d
damn everybody—and learn to laugh! She
would live to make the best of life what-
ever happened; and was' not going to
whine for the moon!

The Whistler.
Down tlie paddock and over the bridge
He rode when the day was spent;
Whistling, whistling, he climbed the ridge. . .
And that was the way he went.
Someone, watching him, smiled farewell,
And waved from her homestead door,
As many a maid, as this world can tell,
Has waved to a man before.
Dusk came down, and the daylight died
On timbered hollow and height. . .
But who was it rode at his saddle-side,
Dark-eyed in the dark of night? v
Dim light fell from the cloudless skies,
White stars through the treetops showed;
Yet, ever watching with, doomful eyes,
Dark Death at his elbow rode!
She-oaks sighed in the fitful wind,
Tree-limbs in the darkness gleamed;
He dreamed of her that he’d left behind,
And little of else he dreamed.
Curlews wailed in the misty gloom
That shrouded the bushland wan;
He thought of her in her firelit room,
And whistling a tun6 rode on.
Yet, as ever he rode adown the track,
And dreamed ’neath the stars of her.
Death galloped nigh on his horse of black
That needed nor whip nor spur.
Men may die in their beds or boots—
Death cares not, with visage grim!. . .
His horse came down in a tangle of roots.
And that was the end of him.
Smiling, musing, beside her hea.rtli,
Cheeks flushed by the glow of youth.
She visioned life as a heaven on earth...
Dawn came, and the mocking truth.

Furrows.
From headland to far headland, flowing free
And cleanly cut, the new-turned furrows
run.
Along their date-brown length lurks
witchery;
And honey pools lie there spilled from
the sun.
Engulfed beneath the sod are clover flowers
And dandelions, and rust-red sorrel blooms ;
Their beauty that oft drugged the passing
hours
Is hidden deep in tumbling earthen tombs.
When dusk drifts from the hills like pansy
smoke,
The little sandy field-mice softly creep
Along the furrows —wandering nomad folk.
As silent as the shadows that throng sleep.
They taste sweet mangled seeds the share
has bled,
And nibble? at rough yellow roots of briar ;
They crouch as still as death, when over-
head
An owl wings by with eyes of ruby fire.
When moon sets shining nets of burnished gold
To catch the music rippling from field birds.
The plovers stalk along the furrows’ fold,
With close-furlod wings and breasts as
white as curds.
And magpies clothed in silver and bold jet
Thrust hungrily beneath each fragrant
clod;
And having eaten never once forget
To offer up their thanks in song to God.
When in the end I fall at last asleep.
My slumber would be sweet and calm and
deep
If through my dreams I sensed the music
• free
Of singing furrows flowing over me!

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Winooka (5 to 2) won the Caulfield
Futurity Stakes in smashing style, and is
now a strong favorite for the Newmarket
Handicap, in which he has 91b. more—9st.
91b. That impost is lib. more than Heroic
scored with and lib. less than Gothic car-
ried on the occasion of his second success.
Big weights are not an insuperable barrier
to victory in the Flemington sprint. Green-
line was first home in 1930 with lOst. 21b.
and third last autumn with lOst. 61b. Water-
line (9st. 21b.) and Mollison (9st. 101 b.)
were second and third respectively in 1931,
when Parkwood gained a narrow verdict
with Bst. 131 b. Winooka never was so fit
as he is at present. He came from the.
cloxxds on February 18 to finish a mere head
behind Ibrani in the Oakleigli Plate. That
outing worked wonders in the Windbag stal-
lion. On Satui-day he ran past Captivation
as if that son of Heroic wei-e anchored.
Waltzing Lily, the fastest three-year-old in
Victoria, knocked right up. in the effort to
measure strides with Winooka.
The manner in which Winooka stretched
out when given a, free rein in the straight
by young Britt was memoi-able. No Futurity
Stakes ever was Avon so easily. Mick
Poison’s speedster took ljsec. off the course
record for seven furlongs, covering the dis-
tance in lmin. 24Jsec. If pushed, he might
have smashed the Austi*alian record of lmin.
23|sec., registered by Captivation towards
the end of last year. Kuvera, as in the St.
George Stakes on the previous Satui-day,
put in a late run and gained second place,
but he was 34 lengths behind Winooka. After
looking dangerous at the half-way stage,
Chatham cracked up badly. A. E. Blair
had reckoned that the fortnight’s spell
between Williamstbwn and the last day at
Caulfield would do immeasurable good to his
stallion, but it may have had the reverse
effect. Gaine Carrington came home splen-
diuly in third place, and Wateidine showed
signs of regeneration by finishing fifth.

cap prospects. Jack Holt and his followers
went baldheaded for St. Ardent. They were
astounded when the chestnut knocked up
half-way down the straight after revealing
his inability to overtake the pacemaker,
Call Bird, who started at 33 to 1. Jacko,
winner of the j Doncaster Handicap, came
with a terrific' burst of speed over the last
two furlongs and failed by only a head to
overhaul Call Bird. Third place went to
Multudo, who belongs to George Allen, of
Perth (W.A.), but is trained by Lou Robert-
son at Mordialloc. Wins have been' regis-
tered by Multudo in three States of the
Commonwealth, and he may be hard to beat
in the Newmarket.
Riding honors on Futurity Stakes day
went to Duncan, who was successful on
Count Orloff, Maltdale and Curly. His
superlative energy had much to do with
Count Orloff’s victory in the second divi-
sion of the St. Clair Trial. The grey son
of Ethiopian had lost a number of races
through being allowed to drop back in the
early stages. Dufican saw to it that Count
Orloff never was far from the front. Tak-
ing charge at the distance he scored by 24
lengths from Metallurgy. Because of the
shortness of the journey (84 furlongs), H.
King, his owner-trainer, did not fancy Metal-
lurgy ; but King is convinced that the Ros-
sendale colt cannot be beaten in the Aus-
tralian Cup of 2i miles. If there is one
quality that Metallurgy possesses it is
stamina. He was putting in excellent work
over the last few furlongs on Saturday.
Maltdale (10 to 1) had to survive a pro-
test for alleged interference in the Wood-
cliff Handicap, but there were no valid
§ rounds for the objection. Maltdale, who
elongs to John S. Brunton, of Sydney, is
engaged in the St. Leger on Saturday. As
Eastern Chief is temporarily under a cloud
by reason of his Woodcliff Handicap failure,
the Rossendale colt may have a reasonable
chance. Ivuvera’s brother, Shakuni,- beat the
Maoriland-bred filly Frimsel by half a head
in the first division of the-Juvenile Handicap.
Here, again, a protest for interference was
not sustained. George - Price, who trains
Shakuni and- Maltdale, must x-eckon that
there is an epidemic of protests in Mel-
bourne. Limarch, the A.J.C. Breeders’ Plate
hero, did not come up to expectations in the
second division of the youngsters’ race, which
L’Elite (Gay Lothai'io —Sweet Marguerite)
won by a narrow margin from Tindall’s
Snowacre.
For Flemington on Saturday:—
Essendon Stakes: Chatham; next, Veil-
mond.
Newmarket Handicap : Jacko, 1; Multudo,
2; Winooka, 3.
St. Leger: Maltdale; next, Kuvera.
Brunswick Stakes: Trevallion; next,
Pretzel.

Rosebery was the scene of the first Satur-
day meeting held under A.J.C. rules on
one of the former pony courses; and long
before it was over most of the punters wished
they had gone to the Test match. They
could not pick winners. Yet if they had fol-
lowed form they wouldn’t have been very
far astray. For instance, Fordlight had been
third, second, first, first and third in five
starts prior to being saddled up for the first
division of the Flying Handicap, and he
was by no means badly treated with Bst.
121 b. Tens could, nevertheless, be got.
Hanging on gamely when tackled by Hava-
spot (also 10 to 1), Fordlight beat the big
chestnut by a neck. Grand Total (20 to 1)
being third. The favorites, Hampton Plane
and Celtic, were not in the first six.
Elmaros, who outstayed her field in the
Rosebery Handicap, had also been successful
in her last race. This filly (she is a daugh-
ter of Moabite —Anna Black) shaped poorly
in the Adrian Knox Stakes, but has im-
proved greatly since, and will have to be
reckoned with in one or two of the Easter
handicaps. She is a very likely-looking bit
of stuff and on the dam’s side is bred to
stay. The Rosebery Handicap was a capi-
tal betting race; it was 6 to 1 Love Song,
Starlike (second) and Winrose (third) ; 7
to 1 Dreamdale, Elmaros, Eaton Queen and
Golden Flash; 8 to 1 Rogerson.
The Three- and Four-year-old * Handicap
was run in three divisions. The first went
to Confab (10 to 1), the second to Flying
Moab (12 to 1) and the third to Springfern
(3 to 1). Ptolemy (third) and Lindean
(second) were at shorter prices than Spring-
fern, so McSliortodds had to return little
or nothing of the swag he had collected on
previous races. As a three-year-old Ptolemy
ran second to Ammon Ra (beating Veii-
mond) in the Chelmsford Stakes, but he has
shown nothing like that ability since. He and
Flying Moab are also by Moabite. Tregilla,
the A.J.C. Derby winner in 1930, had a
race—the first for 18 months —in the second
division of the Flying Handicap, in which a
hot favorite in Whittingham was defeated
by Nellie May; but the son of Treclare, now
a massive, chestnut, gave. no indication of
having recovered his fine three-year-old form.
For Canterbury Park An Saturday :
Flying Handicap: Dunerc; next, Ques-
tionnaire.
Canterbury Handicap: Gippsland; next,
Rogerson.
Highweight Handicap: Tatyoon; next,
Havaspot.
Ashbury Handicap: Intrepid; next,
Cylanta.

“Tio Diego” : The Agua Caliente Handicap, .
poor old Pliar Lap’s one and only triumph on
the other side of the Pacific, will this year
be run on March 26. There are only two
outlanders in the 35 nominations. One is
Boy Painter, a.n English horse, and the other
Pillow Fight, bred in Maoriland and sired by
Night Raid (imp.), who was responsible for
Phar Lap. Pillow Fight has not shown on
this side of the Tasman.

“Coper”: A party of Americans on the
lookout for likely Australian thoroughbreds is
now in Australia on behalf of J. D. Hertz,
a leading American racing man. One of the
party, A. J. Richardson, is an Australian
domiciled in California, and his mission is
not only the buying of brood mares and year-
lings, but to induce Australian owners to
nominate horses for the big American events.
According to him, the horses in the TJ.S.A,
at present are the poorest for years, and
there are great openings for Australian and
M.L. stock. A market of the kind, would
prove a godsend to Australian studmasters.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Sydney followers of boxing,- a diminish-
ing band, are still wondering how Jimmy
Kelso managed to Joutbox and outfight A 1
Foreman at Leichhardt on Thursday night.
Blay had twice . licked, Kelso, and Foreman
had beaten Blay—a welterweight,' whereas
Kelso is only a lightweight—so it was natur-
ally thought that the Englishman would con-
quer Kelso without much trouble. But the
local lad shaded £he visitor in at least 11 of
their 15 rounds. They will, of course, meet
again.
* . j ,i . * * *
Lurich tried hard to make George Tiki
look like a good wrestler in the week-end
Leichhardt match. He is varying his tech-
nique a bit, and with a body-scissors scored
a fall as early as the second round. It;
would have been against union rules if
Tiki had not made it level pegging; this lie
did with a forward-slam in the fourth.
Lurich soon had the Maori’s shoulders down
in the fifth.
Ins and Outs
The “Test-match atmosphere” was refresh-
ingly absent from the fifth game between
Australians and Englishnien at Sydney.
Players and spectators enjoyed every bit of
it, and so far from hooting Larwood the
crowd gave him a wonderful reception when
he made second-highest score, thereby estab-
lishing his right to be regarded as indisput-
ably the greatest all-rounder since J ack
Gregory. As lucky as Collins in one respect,
though not in others, Woodfull won the toss
again, and naturally made first use of a
capital wicket. Before a run was on the
board Richardson was on his way back to
the pavilion, caught by Jardine off Larwood.
Woodfull (14) and Bradman (48) made a
bit of a stand, but at lunch 3 were down for
67, Larwood having got all the wickets for
14. It was a • trying situation for the
younger members of the team, but they were
equal to the emergency. O’Brien (61),
McCabe (73) and Darling (66 n. 0.) covered
themselves with glory, and at stumps t-he
score was 296 with half the wickets in hand.
O’Brien and Darling gave chances which
were not accepted; in fact, the English
catching, for once, was very much “off.”
But fhat is all in the game.
Darling added 19 on Friday by bright
cricket; Oldfield, batting like a champion,
had made 52 when he was run out; and Lee
knocked up 42 in 35 minutes by some of
the breeziest smiting seen during the series.
The last wicket fell at 435 —extremely
creditable in the circumstances. Larwood
took 4 for 98 and Verity 3 for 62; no one
else troubled the batsmen much. O’Reilly
dismissed Jardine for 18 ; then a nice stand
by Sutcliffe and Hammond raised the score
to 153. when Sutcliffe went, caught by
Richardson off O’Reilly, who now had 2 for
35. Hammond (72) and Larwood (5)
played out time; and Larwood astonished
the crowd by his fine work with the bat on
Saturday. He and Hammond put on 92 for
the third wicket, which fell to Lee, Ham-
mond being l.b.w. for 101, made with all his
old elegance. Fourteen in one over off Lee
brought Larwood to 98; in trying to get
the century he .gave an easy chanee to Iron-
monger off the South Australian. He had
made his runs in 138 minutes. The Aus-
tralians’ catchipg had been nearly as poor
as that of the Englishmen. They had a bit
of luck when Leyland (42) and Ames (4)
were run out, the latter as a result of bril-
liant work by Bradman. With a bit more
enterprise on the part of Wyatt (51) and
Allen (25 n. 0.), the visitors might have
been ahead on Saturday instead of finishing
the day 17 behind with two wickets to fall.
However; they gained a lead of 19 on Mon-
day, when Allen went to 48. Again most
of the work was done by two bowlers, in
this case Lee (4 for 111) and O’Reilly (3
for 101). Ironmonger had 64 runs knocked
off him and did not take a wicket.
For the second time Richardson was dis-
posed of by Larwood for a duck. Fingle-
ton made “a pair” in Adelaide and was
dropped from the team; it was fortunate
for Richardson that the chilling experience
befell him in the fifth match and not in the
third. Bradman contributed a sparkling
71, being then bowled by Verity; and Wood-
full held the fort till he got into his fifties.
But matters began to look serious for the
Australians when 4 were down for 139,
O’Brien and McCabe having fallen cheap
victims to Voce. Woodfull went for 67; the
rest failed ; all out, 182.
* * * *
“Tenth Slip”: The committee appointed
by the Board of Control to record its opinion
of leg-theory bowling for the benefit of
Marylebone is a fairly competent one.
Richardson and Woodfull represent the
present-day players; M. A. Noble and Roger
Hartigan the men of an older day. Noble
has remained keenly i interested in the game
since he left off active participation, and
his cricketing deeds are too well known to
recapitulate. Hartigan, an ex-N.S.W. player,
settled in Brisbane many years ago, and for
a long time was one of the State’s batting
mainstays. He was selected for the third
Test at Adelaide in 1908 and scored 116
and 45 n. 0., he and Clem Hill - putting on
243' for the eighth wicket. He played in
only one other Test and averaged 42.50. In
England with the 1909 Eleven, he made 603
runs in all matches, with an average of 18.34
for 33 innings and a top score of 115. For
some years past he has taken a prominent
part in the administration of Queensland
cricket, being one of the State delegates to
the Board of Control.
* * * *
The English XI is to play three matches
in Maoriland. the first on March 23 against
Wellington. The first Test with M.L. begins
at Christchurch on March 24, and lasts three
days. The second Test opens at Auckland
on April 1, and the side leaves for America
on the Aorangi on April 5.
* * * *
“Bramall Lane”: Leg-theory bowling is
older-than F. R. Foster (B. l/2/’33). Few
can recall that W. G. Grace, in the days
when his bowling successes kept pace with
his batting feats, got many of his wickets
in this way. H’is innocent, slow donkey-
drops were irresistible to the leg-hitters of
those days, and brother Fred Grace, one
of the greatest outfields the game ever saw,
usually did the rest somewhere on the leg
boundary. Warwick Armstrong also got
many wickets with leg-theory, though he used
a fuller leg field. Slow as Ms stuff was,
there were not wanting protests against his
run-blocking tactics from English batsmen.
The modern generation has forgotten a lot
of cricket history.
* * * *
“Red and Gold”: The Marylebone C. C.
is to send a cricket side to India, the tour
lasting from October 15 to the end of
February, and including 78 days of play.
There will be three Test matches, at Bom-
bay, Delhi and Secunderabad. At Calcutta
the side will meet the Army in India, and
a combined Indian and Ceylon team. The
tour ends at Colombo, where another India-
Ceylon combination will be tackled. Indian
cricket authorities are anxious for a visit
from an Australian team, and it is probable
that this tour will come off within the next
couple of years.
* * * *
“Zambuk” : In all Tests to date on only
five occasions have batsmen who retired
hurt been unable to finish their innings. All
the victims have, however, been Australians.
The first was in Melbourne in 1878, when
Charlie Bannerman, who had scored 165, was
the unfortunate. Blackham, at Lord’s in
1884, before he’d opened his score; Trumper,
when at 13, at Notts in 1905; Ponsford,
when 5, at Sydney on the Englishmen’s last
tour,. and Oldfield are the others. Of the
five casualty matches Australia has won
one only.

The Nineteenth Hole
“D.”: Dan Soutar’s 25-a-side match at
Randwick between men and women players
resurrected a problem which has often been
asked in recent years: Can women ever
enual men at golf? Players of the class of
Mrs. Reg Bettington have everything now
except length. But then length, according
to some authorities, is all-important. “In
a recent championship,” wrote one critic,
“Bobby Jones gained four clear strokes by
being the only man to save a stroke during
each round at an exceptionally long hole.”
On a normal day Jones can get 300 yards,
or over, from tee or fairway every time he
likes. How manv women can be certain of
getting 250 yards? Yet long-driving isn’t a
question of strength so much as timing. Jim
Ferrier habitually outdrove strong men
when he was an undeveloped youngster. So
did Williams. At present women concen-
trate on the short game and neglect the long
one, in much the same short-sighted way
that our cricketers have been concentrating
on spin and neglecting fast bowling. Male
golfers will get the shock of their lives when
the women change their methods, as they are
bound to do in time.
* * * . *
“Muirfield” : An unusual professional golf
champion is Harry Cotton (B. 15/2/’33).
He has never shown himself eager to repre-
sent England in international matches, and
has exhibited supreme contempt for the
many who have criticised him for his indif-
ferent attitude. He has added to the number
of his critics by taking on a long contract
with the Waterloo club near Brussels, where
he will act as head professional and coach.
This has rendered him ineligible to play for
England in the Ryder Cup match against
American pros, at Southport, Lancashire,
in May. Cotton is a public-school product,
hailing from Dulwich School.
sis SjS * H*
“Ex-dig” : There were rejoicings _ among
N.S.W.’s soldier-golfers at the intimation
that speeches are this year to be restricted
in length after the dinner in connection with
the annual A.I.F. competition. Previous
festivals have been marred not only by the
dreariness of orations, but by old gents,
who were to blame for them. There is no
valid reason why, because a club hands over
its course for the day to the Diggers, club
officials should intrude. The post-prandial
atmosphere is foreign and embarrassing to
most of them, and they reveal it in their
remarks. One ancient very nearly got the
bird at the last A.I.F. feast I went to. The
ideal arrangement would be, no toasts except
the King and the cup-winner, and the diners
to be restricted to participants in the com-
petition.
(Continued on next page.)
At Sydney’s Coogee Aquarium on Satur-
day night Kalili, the Hawaiian, easily de-
feated Phil Hooper in the 100 yards in
54sec. —2-ssee. better than the Australian
record for the distance. In the 100 yards
backstroke Vic. Besomo, of Bondi, beat
Ivaliji, and cut the Australian record by
1 l-ssec., his time being lmin. 5 3-ssec. On
the same day Godfrey Vockler, swimming in
Middle Park baths, Melbourne, knocked
22sec. off his Australian record for 300
yards, making the time now 3min. 9 2-ssec.

Ins and Outs
“Aigburth”: In spite of all the hypocri-
tical yammer to the contrary, fast bowlers
have deliberately bowled at the man, on
occasions at least. Writer is old enough
to recall Crossland, of Lancashire, who
greatly affected the practice, and was notori-
ous as a “chueker” to boot. Lord Harris
refused to captain one Test team in England
if Crossland was included, and the 1882
Australians protested bitterly against his
fast stuff, just as other Australians are
doing in 1933 in the case of Larwood and
Voce. Crossland was finally “umpired” out
of the game, as many others were if profes-
sionals. Amateurs got a gentle hint to
confine their activities to minor cricket.
sk sk ❖ 5k
“Laudator, Etc.”: A favorite contention
of many old-timers is that Trumper would
have made Larwood’s leg-theory look like
the deliveries of a change bowler in a kin-
dergarten vigoro team. One sage with a
better memory than others, a contemporary
in big cricket with the immortal Victor to
boot, doesn’t agree. He recalls that in
1911-12, when Victor met F. It. Foster, the
man who introduced the packed leg field to
this country, after scoring 113 at their first
meeting, he made a mere 30 in his next eight
innings against the Warwickshire man and
Barnes. A lot of his mates were in the same
fix, as the fact that England won four of
the five Tests indicates.
s}! >k >k s|i
“Statist”: His two innings in the Brisbane
Test match brought Bradman’s score in first-
class games this season to 1044. He is mak-
ing a habit of passing the thousand-mark.
He began it in 1928-29, when his aggre-
gate was 1690; in the three following seasons
his totals were 1586, 1422 and 1403.
❖ -k Jk j|:
“White Horse”: According to the cables,
Alan Fairfax, who has been playing as a pro-
fessional in Lancashire League cricket, pro-
poses to play as an amateur with Kent next
season. Kent is supposed, like Yorkshire,
to ban from the county team all players who
have not been born within its borders. If
Alan can claim Kentish birth, well and
good, but if he ever acknowledged that honor
in Australia, writer cannot recall it. As
to the change-over, there is plenty of prece-
dent for it. One comparatively recent in-
stance is that of J. Sharp, who, after play-
ing as a pro. for Lancashire, qualified for
the addition of the magic “Mr.” to his name
and became skipper of the eounty eleven.
Racquet and Bawl
“Milton”: Queensland is considering the
inauguration of a series of inter-State lawn-,
tennis matches on the lines of Sheffield
Shield cricket. The inter-State games as
at present constituted are largely farcical—
that between N.S.W. and Victoria, for in-
stance, started before the Melbourne Test
with America, is only half-finished, an/d
likely to remain sp—and it is held that
regular visits t 0 Brisbane by other States—
Queensland only sees a weak N.S.W. side
every year—would greatly improve the
standard of tennis in the northern State.
There are a lot of hurdles between the idea
and its fruition. Highest of them, and most
important to the other States, is the ques-
tion whether the Brisbane gates would be
worth the trouble. The improvement of
Queensland tennis is a minor matter by
comparison.
- * * * *
“Cut Shot” : If the Australian Davis Cup
team gets through to the European zone
final with Britain as opponent, it is intended
to press to have the match decided at Wim-
bledon. The immensely wealthy Wimble-
don club is notoriously indifferent as to
Davis Cup matches, and in England these
are always played at some seaside centre
where decent gates are out of the question.
hefi na l will not be played until after the
All-England championships at Wimbledon,
and there seem.s no particular reason why
the change should not be made.
* * * *
“Centre Court”: Gordon Lowe, who was
here with an English Davis Cup team in
1915, has been trying his hand at a ranking
list of the 10 best tennis-players, past and
present. His choice reads: Tilden, H. L.
Doherty, Brookes, Johnston, R F. Doherty,
Wilding, Lacoste, Cochet, Darned and Mc-
Loughlin. No mention of Vines, you will
note, though modernity acclaims the young-
ster as superior to Tilden. The best 10
w°-n e « are , head ed by La Lenglen and Helen
Wills-Moody in that order. Then come
'r\> e f? ames Chambers and Godfree, Senorita
D Alvarez and M'esdames Bundy, Larcombe,
Bterry, Hillyard and Mallory.
The Nineteenth Hole
Pom : Jardine’s team has more golfers
of merit than any of the sides that have
opposed it in Australia. There are no low-
markers among Australia’s Test hopes, with
th e _ exception of young Tobin, who is a
leading S. Aus. amateur. The idea still pre-
vails in Australia that the better a man
becomes at golf the more his batting goes
oft, and the case of Bradman is sometimes
pointed to with the remark that his down-
tall began from the time he discovered the
delights of hitting a stationary ball. Betting-
ton was quite a useful bat before he defi-
nitely entered the championship class as a
golfer, and the Englishman Wethered made
big scores for I Zingari before he began
making low ones at Sandwich and elsewhere
* * * *
Wi Rabbo”: Moore Park, Sydney, is
tbe latest to go over to the craze for making
every course a championship one. At pre-
sent it is ideally suited to the form of 95
per cent, of those who use it; that is to
say, no holes are outrageously long, and no
tairways are narrow. You can' practically
rn ”'. a course from the standpoint of the
rabbit (meaning anyone with a handicap of
J 8 or over) with one impossible hole. The
tlnrd at Ryde, with a ditch that collects a
normal player’s second as often as not, and
an absurdly narrow fairway to follow, is a
case in point. If the City Council wants to
do something to improve Moore Park, it
snould (1) keep a bigger area mowed, and
thus diminish the tally of lost balls, and
GQ station an employee—at any rate, on
Saturdays and Sundays—on the rising
guiund overlooking the 3rd and 16th greens,
winch would diminish the lost-ball tally still
further. Moore Park has a few class players,
but it is essentially a beginners’ course and
a links for the liard-up multitude; and the
council should handle it accordingly.
* * * *
“F.S.”: A Sydney seaside course is pro-
bably the only one in the world which has;
a notification on these lines posted in its
smoking-room: “Any member who employs
Blank Blank as a caddie will be disqualified.”
Blank, an excellent caddie, is. alleged to have
prehensile toes, and, possibly with the idea
of giving them full scope, lie never wears
boots. The charge levelled against him by
the hidalgoes of the club is that he has a
costly habit of spiriting members’ balls
away ; lie is supposed to run ahead and
"do his spiriting gently” with his feet. This
for some reason is considered a more flagi-
tious practice than that of the boot- or
blucher-wearer of so many other sandy
courses. This type of ball-fancier crushes
his prey into the earth with a smart twist
of the foot, joins hypocritically in the sub-
sequent search, and comes back to collect
when the hue and cry has died down. By
the way, I have never seen this notice dis-
played in any club; “Any member will be
disqualified who buys a brand-new Dunlop
for a shilling.”
Car and Cycle
Though Daytona beach was decidedly
bumpy and Malcolm Campbell was nursing
a sprained wrist, the Englishman last week
raised the one-mile motor record to 272.10 S
m.p.h., 18.14 m.p.li. better than his time of
a year ago. The car used had the same
chassis as the Blue Bird of last year, but
the body was redesigned, and the Napier
engines, producing 1450-h.p. were replaced
by Rolls-Royces of the type designed for
Schneider Trophy ’planes, developing 2500
h.p. Seventy-two per cent, more power
yielded 0 2-3 per cent, more speed.
* * * *
“Four Horses”: The Melbourne-Sydney
motor-cycle record has been fractured again;
D. Bain, of Sydney, riding a 498-c.c. 0.1i.v.
model A.J.S., polished off the 575 miles
in llhr. 27min., which lops an hour and
nine minutes off A. Finlay’s time, put up in
1931. When only a hundred miles of his
journey had been covered, Bain commenced to
have trouble with his magneto; he lost some
time trying to fix it, and maintained his
very respectable average of 50.2 m.p.h. de-
spite chronic misfiring. Bonds were good
all along, and there was no trouble with
tyres. And no pedestrian was hit.

“0.11. V.” : A note on this page concerning
chainless bicycles didn't mention the two
American makes that made a brief appear-
ance here—the Columbia and the Sterling.
Both embodied principles in design that have
only recently found their way into motor-car
differential cases. There used to be a chainless
motor-cycle on the market —the Henderson,
also Yankee —which embodied also a 4-cylin-
der engine. But the chain seems to be the
only thing for two-wheelers, power- or foot-
driven. Like other things about the homely
push-bike, the short-pitch roller-chain is an
example of mechanical perfection, providing
efficiency in transmission of close on 98 p.c.
under laboratory conditions, and giving
pretty nearly as good service on the road.
The first short-pitch chains seen in Australia
were fitted to that very fine English bicycle
the Osmond, and were fin. pitch. Shortly
after that innovation the B.S.A. and Eadie
people (they amalgamated long ago) both
brought out fin. pitch chain gears.

On Feb. 19 Laurence Roy, a 19-year-old
Victorian cyclist, became one-mile champion
of Australia by beating the title-holder,
Fethybridge, of N.S.W., on Melbourne Ex-
hibition speedway. Five days later the lad
was dead. On Wednesday night he fell
shortly after the start of the race for the
half-mile championship, and fractured his
skull, his crash helmet falling off before
he struck the cinder track. The helmet is
a wise precaution,' but, oddly enough, in the
great days of cycling at the beginning of
the century, when helmets were unheard of,
there were (outside gravel rashes and cuts
attributable to rat-trap pedals) hardly any
head injuries caused by racing smashes. The
old brigade, though they strapped their feet
to the nedalj?. seemed to have a catlike faculty
for falling ligh’t.
Miscellaneous
“Gate”: The N.S.W. Rugby League has
announced its programme for the year, the
first practice matches being set down for
April 1, with the grade competitions opening
on April 25. Dates for the inter-State games
with Queensland are waiting for the Banana-
landers’ confirmation. If these are as ar-
ranged, the Australian team which is to tour
the North of England next season will be
chosen on June 10 and will depart overseas
on July 7.
'l* "! : V V
“Stand Off”: Dr. Matthews, manager of
the Australian Rugby Union team which
sails for South Africa on April 25, was a
first-rank half-back in his day, playing for
N.S.W. against Queensland in 1906 and
1910, and against A. F. Harding’s British
side in 1908. He is no stranger to the
management side of the game, either, for he
ran the successful A.I.F. XV in Britain arid
Australia. Of late years he has done much
to revive the amateur code in western N. 8.
Wales.
* * * *
“Toowong”: Queenslanders regret that
they will not see the Westralian eight figur-
ing in the race for the King’s Cup on the
Brisbane River in May. It has now become
the custom for Westralia to call off the long
trip to Queensland, the Bananalanders doing
likewise when Perth is the convincing water.
The last time the Gropers rowed in Brisbane
was in 1920, when South Aus. won, with
W.A. second. However, sculler Langley will
represent the West in the one-man cham-

“Stawell”: At a recent meeting of the Vic.
Athletic League it was stated that profes-
sional pedestrianism is reviving again, especi-
ally in the country districts. Most of the
clubs are unregistered, however, and there
is little hope that they will affiliate with
the League unless the arenas on which they
race are thrown open to bookmakers.
The Government is to be asked to permit
open betting at Geelong, Warrnambool and
other country centres. Professional running
without betting is, of course, an absurdity.

LONDON? then The Langham!
The Langham is central, — right in the
heart of London. Handy for the City.
Handy for the Shops. The Langham
is comfortable quiet, spacious rooms
and a quick, watchful personal service.
The Langham is English. Its modern
conveniences—running water and
electric fires, for example, in every
bedroom have stolen nothing from
its old peace, its old welcome!

A WOMAN'S

Lennon's Hotel

Distinguished Social Life.
Twenty thousand tons of luxury the
Cunard liner Carinthia brought into Port
Jackson on Sunday; and by lunch time, her
passengers being scattered, Sydney callers
liad_ a chance to look over the millionaire
cruise-ship. The magnificence culminates in
the smoking-room. Here a blending of the
Moorish and the Spanish is evidenced in
everything but the easy chairs. But
the smokeroom that belongs to the tourist
passengers when the ship carries three
classes is the more popular. This is de-
signed on Old English inn lines, complete
even to the little bar (but the drinks are
served at an up-to-date bar round to the
left), the chairs are rush and the floor is
of red tiles. The writing-room is English—
all Wedgwood blues from carpet and cur-
tains to the china in the cabinets. Here
behind the glass door are medallions of the
Royal family, among them a delicate one
of the Duchess of York. The cardroom
favors Doulton. The dining salon is Gothic.
There are swimming pools, a marble one.
below stairs and one open to the sun and
the breeze on the upper deck, gymnasiums
and garden lounges, which are open ter-
races flooded with soft light and filled with
flowers.
There is no trouble in picking the Sydney
church that had the biggest congregation
on Sunday night. The Balmain Methodist
Mission had advertised an Archie Jackson
memorial service, and there were nearly as
many outside as could get in. P. F. Warner
and Woodful and Kippax and Mailey were
to have delivered addresses; but only the
Englishman spoke—the others had written
their little sermons, and the minister read
them. Archie had been a regular attendant
at this mission church, and one of its most
modest heroes. It was both an effective and
an affecting service: not the least effective
part of it “Abide with Me,” sung as a solo
by Miss Dunstan.
The first of the Red Cross Society’s quar-
terly meetings was one of the successes of
last week. The acceptances had rolled in
at such a rate that a glad committee planted
its standard in the Blaxland galleries instead
of in the Oak Hall of Farmer’s, which had
been at first named as the rendezvous. Two
hundred and fifty workers turned up, and
many of these had been at the first meeting
called at the beginning of the war. Mrs.
Alfred Lee, one of the strong supports of
Red Cross, told how these meetings were
held every week during the war in the
society’s club in George-street, with Miss
Macarthur-Onslow presiding. After the
war they became one of the Rose Hall
monthly fixtures, but with the move from
Rose Hall they had ceased.
The newly-returned-from-Europe Miss
Macarthur-Onslow was one of the four
guests of honor. Mayoress Hagon, the Chief
Justice’s lady and Mrs. Russell Nolan were
also met with the posy of welcome from
Dame Mary Cook, and honorable mention
from chairman R. J. Hawkes. Mayoress
Hagon and the C.J.’s lady have lately been
added to the society’s vice-presidents.
J. T. Lang, leader of the Opposition, had
to be up early the other morning for the
wedding of his only son James to Mary
Dowling, of Centennial Park. The vows
were blessed at St. Francis’s Church in
Paddington during a Nuptial Mass, and
after the ceremony a pictorial touch was
given by the guard of honor formed by
girls of the Tlieresian Club, of which the
bride is a member. The wedding breakfast
was spread at Dungowan, and the honey-
moon is being spent in Maoriland.
The Victoria League’s welcome home to
Miss Sibella Macarthur-Onslow was a great
racket. Leaguers completely filled and over-
flowed the lounge on the first floor of the
Australia, after shaking hands with the
wanderer, the Chief Justice’s lady and Lady
Game. These three stood at the head of
the stairway (“making the Australia safe
for democracy,” the Girl in the Flat Oppo-
site whispered) and extended the kindly
hand-clasp impartially to cotton and kid.
■ Lady Game, still with the bloom of Tas-
mania upon her, looked crisp and energetic
in a beige pink frock, smart with a bolero.
Her hat was black, plain and shady. Chief
Justice Street’s lady wore cool grey chiffons
patterned in black, and the flat black crepe
frock of Miss Macarthur-Onslow displayed a
front of white lace that finished off with
revers. You might think that old-fashioned,
but it’s really very new. A presentation
armful of damask-red roses gave color to
her sable raiment.
Among the visitors from overseas were
* . ce . Lady Hayes and her sister, Miss
Wilkinson, who arrived by the Maloja to
have a look at their native land. Mrs. M.
L. Reading, Mrs. Hurlbutt and Miss Marks
were from Brisbane, so remained umvilted
during the sticky hours. Of the local
knights’ ladies, honorable mention goes to
Hugh Denison’s tall wife, very distinguished
in beige laces that swung a gallant little
cape; a wide brown hat of tailored line was
a pictorial finish. Mrs. Roystone Davey’s
flower-besprigged brown chiffons were topped
by an enviable brown baku hat. Mrs. Harry
Dransfield brought burgundy chiffons and
.sister Mrs. Digby Hay, from Bundanoon, to
the party. Tlie T. R. Bavins were there, and
so was padre Micklem with his bride —a
sweet expression between a neat grey silk
suit and a plain little hat was the snap-
shot one got of her across the crowded room.
The Cook, Fuller and Hughes ladies added
titles and impressive frocking to the fray.
There were representatives of the Board of
Missions, the C. of E. hostel committee and
the National Council of Women; among
these last were Gladys Marks and Mrs.
Muscio.
Dr. Mario Pettorelli, who was lent by
Rome to serve as conductor of St. Mary’s
choir for four years, says that as a city we
run short on tenors. In baritones, basses and
sopranos we are fairly prolific; in contraltos
we show a falling off. and of tenors we pro-
duce very few. The doctor is no believer in
this running out to an apple orchard An
spring watching how the birds do it, and
then just opening the voice box and doing
likewise. His dictum for the would-be pro-
fessional singer is long hours of exercise. He
says that the good singer- should be able to
carol for hours daily without any strain. You
get no soothing syrup of about 20 minutes’
practice in the morning, 20 minutes’ in the
evening, from these masters who come from
countries where great music is as much a
part of life as the daily bread.
The Fellowship of Australian Writers
faces its year’s woi’k with Dr. George Mac-
kaness president once more. The vice-
presidents are numerous and magnificent,
among them Henry Handel Richardson,
knight Robert Garran and Dr. James Booth.
Mary Gilmore is the only local woman-
writer among the vice-presidents, but on the
committee there are three of the sex—
Dulcie Deamer, Nora McAuliffe and Mrs.
A. B. Crowthcr —to nine men. Marjorie
Quinn (P.E.’s daughter and Rod’s niece)
will again carry on as secretary, with Lyle
Stevenson for assistant.
The fellowship is growing. During last
year its membership was doubled; and now
it is starting a movement to try to form a
joint advisory council of all the fellowships
and literary societies in Australia to con-
stitute an Australia-wide literary authority.
One object would be to help authors in the
publication of their books. A quarterly jour-
nal and representation on the Common-
wealth Censorship Board are other tasks to
be attempted in 1933.
Australia has always been rich in poets
and story-makers. The last two years have
shown a marked increase in the number of
play writers. Scarcely a month passes nowa-
days without
some pen mak-
ing an offer-
ing on the
altar of trag-
edy or comedy.
One of the
latest to have
her three-acter
pro duced is
Mrs. Tookie
Hannam, and
she had the
good luck to
have her in-
triguing mys-
tery play
“Why?” pre-
sented by
George and
Beryl Bryant
at Bryant's
Playhouse at
the top of the
For bes-street
steps in Darlinghurst. The cast, by the way,
included Joan H’annam, a young daughter
of the author and a promising amateur.
No need to shy off from the word Eistedd-
fod any longer. Roland Foster has eluci-
dated the pronunciation once and for all. He
announced, practically on oath, the other
day that you say it “ice-teth-vod,” accent on
the “teth,” and he went on to explain that
pronounced this way it meant far more than
a musical competition: “it signifies a gath-
ering of people interested in the preserva-
tion and cultivation of music and poetry.”
These are the aims of the City of Sydney
Eisteddfod, which is to be held each August
during Music Week. Lud Mayor Ilagon and
former Mayor Walder are keen supporters.
They say it will bring between ten and
fifteen thousand visitors to the city.
Robin Jay (doesn’t it sound the ideal
name for a film star?), who arrived in
Sydney not long ago from England with her
father, Major W. C. P. Jay, of the White
Lodge, Datchet, was married last week to
Lauclilan Mackinnon, one of Melbourne’s
most eligible young men. She was pink
from her veil to her bouquet of Cecil Brunner
roses. The two ’maids wore pink organdie,
the wedding-cake was iced in pink, and
pink was the recurring note in the decora-
tions of St. Mark’s at Darling Point, where
padre F. T. Perkins tied the knot and where
Pipe-Major Dixson greeted the new Mrs.
Mackinnon and her smiling ’groom with a
fine skirl of the bagpipes. The reception
at No. 5 St. Mark’s-road. Darling Point,
was hostessed by Mrs. McKeown, the bride’s
sister, and here the clan Mackinnon \vas
well represented, the ’groom’s mother wear-
ing a posy of deep red roses with her sap-
phire-blue* frocking. Mrs. Tommy Marks,,
the bride’s aunt, has lent her house at
Bowral for the honeymoon.
Morning tea was held at the rooms of the
Society for the Relief of the Adult Deaf and
Dumb in honor of Mrs. Hornidge, who was
recently married, and who has been a worker
for the cause for the past six years. The
C.J.’s lady presented on behalf of the
Women’s Central Committee a cheque and
a posy to the guest of honor, and expressed
great appreciation of Mrs. Hornidge’s work.
This is Lud Mayor H’agon’s fair daugh-
ter Margaret, and the word “fair” is used
to mean both
blonde and
pretty. Mar-
garet has al-
ready been
c o n s t i tuted
fi rs t lie u-
tenant to her
M a y oress
mother, and
has show n
quite a talent
for entertain-
ing on the big
scale. She
will be in the
public dye at
civic recep-
tions and balls
during h e r
father's term
of office, but
when away
from gauds
and excite-
merits there’s nothing the slim girl likes
better than surfing off Palm Beach, at
which waterfront the family has its summer
home. The photo, is from Dayue.
Last Friday the lounge of Usher’s was
crowded with newspaper women drinking
cocktails or orange juice or just plain milk
to the future happiness of Olwen Hughes.
Olwen was probably the baby cadet of Asso-
ciated News when she started out some years
ago with her fountain-pen and portable. She
is pretty and small and fair, has an in-
gratiating smile, and is just round the corner
from twenty. She downs tools to enter into
an agreement to keep house for Claude
Handley, of the C.S.R. The two will marry
in April, and thenceforth will live in Fiji.
Blanche D’Alpuget, of the “Woman’s
Mirror,” whom a street-accident drove into
St. Vincent’s with an injured hip three
months ago, came out on sticks at the
week-end. The doctors tried to make it
crutches; but the patient couldn’t manage
them at all. However, she is doing very
well, and will do better still if the good
wishes of a host of friends avail.
Annette Kellerman is coming back to Aus-
tralia for a rest and a holiday: she may
spend nearly 12 months here. A sister,
Marcelle (Mrs. Wooster), is in these parts
as well as an uncle, and among the Keller-
mans family ties are very strong. There is
a story about the fairy-tale book the two
sisters produced last year. They were in
London, after a tour of the Continent —
Annette had been “showing”—and the
weather was vile. There could be no
thought of travelling, so Annette suggested
turning her under-water experiences to
account, and thereafter they lived for weeks
in the great libraries and in the British
Museum checking up data for their stories
and pictures of queer fish.
Another Australian writer is off to Lon-
don with a volume in his bag—Alan
McNicoll, the young naval officer who a
few months ago produced a volume of
verse wholly set up and otherwise fabricated
aboard ship. Alan is one of four sons of
the General who used to be head of the
P.L.C. at Goulburn, and is now M.H.R. for
the district in which he once dominied. One
of Alan’s brothers has made the woodcuts
for the new book, another has designed the
jacket. The fourth —who is just starting
a literary career —ought to provide a fore-
word.
Journalist Johnnie Sandes, just back from
Norfolk and Lord Howe Islands, declares
the latter to be the ideal spot for a holiday;
the islanders in his opinion live the closest
thing to the lives of the lotus-eater. And
why shouldn’t , they? Each island household
is sure of its income, for as the Kentia
palms grow so do its pounds, shillings and
pence. Though, this palm will grow in
other lands, its seeds refusje to become fer-
tile in any other climate; hence, whenever a
hankering for tliese palms strikes a town-
planning committee, from Iceland to the
Bluff, Lord Howe must get the order. In
this atmosphere of towering mountains, blue
lagoons, the thundering Pacific and mur-
murous palms Frank Hutchens and a group
of Conservatorium students spent their
Christmas vacation, and here Frank drew
inspiration for a new composition, “Lagoon,”
which he played for his summer playfellows
on the voyage home. Johnnie Sandes says
it is just oozing with atmosphere. Mr.
Holman, too, went Southward Ho! but he
spent his time at Norfolk Island, probably
mulling up facts and figures such as a
politician delights in.
It wasn’t a bit of a surprise when Cyril
Ritchard told the audience early in the after-
noon at the theatrical matin6e that the
f5OO-mark had already been reached. The
show was one of the brightest and the house
one of the biggest and most fashionable
Sydney has seen for a long time. Three
charities benefit: the Hospice for the Dying,
the Golden Fleece Kindergarten and the
J. C. Williamson Sick Fund. A great
worker for the first, Mrs. J. C. Williamson
looked impressive in a box, while Mrs.
Jimmy Bancks, whose weight goes behind
the Golden Fleece Kindergarten, buzzed
about in cool green silks and one of the
smallest white toques on record. All the
girls you'd ever heard of seemed to be among
the traders, most of them still wearing their
summer holiday complexions. Gladys Mon-
crieff got the loud, hand of the after-
noon in a scene from “Maid of the Moun-
tains,” and certainly this Australian singer
is at top form.
From Brisbane :
Sir Leslie and Lady Wilson, Marjorie Wilson, the
Earl and Countess of Pembroke, Colonel G. F. Her-
bert and Captain Honnor went cruising round Strad-
broke Island in F. C. Golder’s yacht, the Amy. The
Southport branch of the R.S.S.I.L. had a reception
for Lady Pembroke in recognition of what she and
her husband did for Australian soldiers during the
war.
The late Archie Jackson’s fiancee —the engage-
ment was, by his wish, announced the day before
he died—is a pretty and much-liked girl, daughter
of the H. G. Thomases, of Clayfield. She is an
accomplished dancer and, with her brother (a duo
under the name of Phyl and Ray), danced her way
into the heart of the public both here and in the
south. She was with Nellie Bramley’s company at
the Royal in a dance turn. She was dancing at the
Regent during the young cricketer’s illness.
Ex-Treasurer W. H. Barnes, who died at his
Coorparoo home, was accorded a State funeral. He
is survived by his widow and only son, Dr. C. G. H.
Barnes; there are two grandchildren, Cedric and
Kathryn.
Before leaving Brisbane, D. R, Jardine, captain
of the M.C.C. cricket team, gave a dinner at
Lennon’s to Mrs. G. T. Bell, Misses Bell, Mr. Ross
Philp, M. Thwaites and F. G. Birchall.
Judith Crombie, who is to marry Russell Tapp,
was entertained at a bridge party by Mrs. Norman
Murray (Beaconsfield) and Margaret Wilson at the
Wilsons’ home, Bowen Terrace. Mauve and pink
asters decked the lounge for bridge. In the after-
noon Kathleen McCulloch gave a bridge tea for
Judith, when brass bowls of yellow zinnias decorated
the lounge at Hynam, Hamilton.
Phyllis Barton, daughter of the Geoffrey Bartons,
of Toweron, Lowmead, is engaged to Hugh Lus-
combe-Newman, Sydney.
Agnes Finney, who married Major O. C. Wolff,
late on Sir John Goodwin’s staff at Brisbane Gov-
ernment House, has been a guest at the historic
Hatfield House in England, where she saw Queen
Elizabeth’s silk stockings and a mulberry-tree
planted by James I. She is daughter of the
Hubert Finneys, Brisbane.
Alan Pitt married Nita Brown, daughter of
the late Horatio Brown and of Mrs. A. D. Alex-
ander, at St. Ignatius’s, Toowong. Dr. J. G. Wagner
gave the bride away; she wore ivory lace with a
veil cf white and pink tulle. Mrs. John Mac-
donald was matron of honor in parchment georgette
lace with a cream picture hat.
The Anglican church, Longreaeh, saw the nuptials
of Rowland . Jameson, son of Ex-Judge and Mrs.
Charles Jameson, and Grace, daughter of the Colin
Bells, and grand-daughter of the late Joshua Bell,
one-time President of Queensland Legislative Council.
The bride wore floral crepe de Chine.
At St. James’s, Toowoomba, Allan Douglas and
Ruby Isabel Heness were made one. Dr. Spencer
Roberts gave his sister-in-law away; she wore mag-
nolia satin with a tulle and ecru veil. Jessie Heness,
in leaf green, and Edna Douglas, in pink mariette,
’maided. The feasting was at Finchley, the Spencer
Roberts home.
Among the outward bound by the Mongolia were
Mrs. John Mcßobert (husband is Queensland manager
of Robert Harper’s) and daughter Margaret. Mar-
garet, a very tall, attractive Goulburn P.L.C. girl,
has had a couple of years on the “Daily Mail,” and
hopes to improve her year or more in London by
seeing how Fleet-street W'orks.

Chatter
The latest decree of fashion is that
velvet is the stuff for evening wear. Even
if the gown be not of this material it is
almost compulsory to have a full-length coat
of the new crushed ring velvet, which looks
as if it had been rolled up wet and sat upon.
Uncertainty still- reigns as to the correct
location of the waist-line. Evening gowns
are all clinging, slim and long, the effect of
slenderness being achieved in most cases by
pieces joined like a jig-saw puzzle. Plain
satin, a very soft, old-fashioned brocaded
satin, many of the crepey materials and
georgette are permissible. A pale-pink vel-
vet gown fashioned with a little cross-
over bodice .has elbow-length sleeves bordered
with a regular mat of ostrich-feather trim-
ming, dyed to an exact match. Red shades
that lean towards the wine tones promise
to be first favorites both for night and day
wear. Something unusual are white gowns
with frilled velvet sleeves, crimson or some
other bright hue. Topcoats of cloth have
fur collars of immense size, and tweed coats
have scarf collars so arranged that one end
buttons across the chest on one side with
large buttons. Belts are generally worn
with these coats. Velvet has found its way
as trimming on to coats of self-colored cloths,
and short capes are again in evidence.
Go-as-you-please seems to be the rule for
next winter’s fashions. Sleeves may be
plain or puffed, close-fitting or leg o’ mut-
ton ; and if you wear ’em bishop style, that,
too, is quite in order. Corduroy velvet is
to be readmitted to favor accompanied by a
new acquaintance, Matt velvet, a lovely aull
fabric that assumes natural folds. Of course
there are new shades, tagged with not very
informative names —paprika, spicewood
brown, Hindu red (a cross between straw-
berry and tomato), pepper, freedom blue,
honey, beetroot and anchovy. Also there
are some new combinations of fabrics. White
pique trims black velvet frocks, and there
are velvet flounces on georgette gowns. Fur
appears in unexpected places, and is even
used for puff sleeves. Expensive additions
to coat-frocks and suits are in ermine, broad-
tail or Persian lamb, forming little capes
with’ a sort of modified Medici collar. In
some cases there’s a muff and cap to match.
The new season’s millinery was the sub-
ject of a mannequin show at the Victoria,
just the heads and shoulders of the manne-
quins being visible with slow-motion turns
to show the hats at every angle. The nut-
covers were associated with matching
scarves, fur necklets and tippets and the
top hems of satin blouses. Most of the hats
were small, some tiny. A series comprised
small hats with curled brims, all finished
with a stiff little bow at the back and worn
with a tilt over one eye. All autumn mil-
linery to be fashionable must be pushed side-
ways or forward. The beret appeared in
a form suggestive of the Watteau period, and
toques showed a stout determination to
resemble the pork-pie cap of the Yankee
sailor. Greys were to the fore, particularly
steel hue. All trimming was simple—a mere
band of ribbon, a single bow or a wreath
of soft plumage. Steel button-like orna-
ments were also introduced to cheer plain
felt hats.
There was a comprehensive show of the
new autumn millinery at Caulfield on Satur-
day on a day that gave us a winter’s dawn
and a midsummer’s sunset. The fair sex has
rediscovered the fact that velvet is most
becoming, particularly when associated with
fluffy curls or a nicely marcelled coiffure.
So there were velvet nut-covers by the dozen
and a- legion of little veils. Distrustful of
the weather, many women chose woollen or
tweed suits, and a few sweltered in fur coats
of the latest model. Mrs. J. Chambers, one
of our air pilots, wore diagonal-striped tweed
in fawn and brown, topped by a folded toque
of chocolate tint. Mrs. Benjamin Chaffey.
a recent arrival from Los Angeles with her
husband, who is a nephew of Ben Chaffey,
chairman of the V.A.T.C., chose grey tweed
inlet with a darker shade forming yoke and
revers. Her tam-o’-shanter toque was of
putty color. Mrs. Ben Chaffey, who enter-
tained several guests at the midday meal,
was in two shades of green, with a myrtle-
tinted straw hat wreathed with flowers. Lady
Bourne, from South Africa, was in cobalt
blue, with a white felt hat, and her good-
looking daughter Pamela wore a silk pique
frock of lettuce-green shade and a matching
hat. Mrs. E. O'. Anderson, another travel-
ler from South Africa, was in a black-and-
white spotted silk frock topped by a scarlet
straw hat. Mr. and Mrs. J. Brodie, from
England, were also enjoying the charms of
the Heath. Mrs. P. Osborne, from over the
border, sported navy blue and white with a
shady hat. Mrs. John Winter-Irving and
her daughter, Mrs. Bruce Mead, were in
black and white, and Mrs. Horton Lewis
also favored the magpie contrast. Mrs. A.
Patterson, whose suit and toque were mush-
room-pink, was there with her husband and
Mr. anfl Mrs. H. Nathan. She has just
returned from a tour of China.
At the Lyceum Club Mr. and Mrs. Her-
bert Brookes staged a luncheon as a wel-
come-home to Mr. and Mrs. Edward Dyason
after a world tour. Mr. Dyason is chair-
man of the Bureau of International Affairs,
and during his absence Mr. Brookes acted
in his stead. The table was decorated with
bowls of varicolored phlox, and the guests
included people interested in the bureau,
The guests of honor gave their impressions
of conditions in England and on the Conti-
nent. An ensemble in two tones of blue was
worn by Mrs. Brookes, and her daughter
Jessie was in an embroidered frock of pastel-
green silk with matching straw hat.
Mary Emmerton, wearing flowered silk in
hues of green and fawn, with a beige-colored
coat and brown straw hat, gave a bridge
party at the Lyceum Club to welcome violin-
ist Muriel Campbell and her sister Dora
back from a holiday in India, and to say
farewell to the Allen lady and her daughter
Biddy on the eve of their departure for
Europe.
Betty Timmins poured tea, between a
rubber or two of bridge, for a number of
guests collected to say au revoir to Penelope
Stead, who will travel with Mrs. Arthur
Moore and her good-looking daughter Betty
to England in a few days’ time. Mrs.
Arthur Timmins was present to support her
daughter, the gathering being at her Toorak
home.
There was a tea party at the Brighton
home of Mrs. I. H. Moss, president of the
N.C.W., in honor of the Rev. Dorothy Wil-
son, and the visitor was also entertained at
luncheon at the Victoria la-ague clubrooms,
where Mrs. Arthur Hordern assembled sev-
eral members to' meet her.
The art world of Melbourne hasn’t had
so much to talk about for years. Opinions
differ as to the merits of the Gallery’s
new Epstein. Authorities as eminent as
Mclnnes, who is off to London shortly to paint
the Duke of York, claim that it is an out-
rage on art for a sculptor to portray a
woman with a goitre. On the other hand,
the Epstein bronzes which Mrs. Alleyne
Zander has brought here as part of her
“Exhibition of British Art” are generally
approved. Yet there have been audible wails
about them. Mrs. Zander’s collection in-
cludes the largest consignment of Augustus
John’s work ever sent to the Southern Hemi-
sphere. It includes the master’s famous
“Marchesa Casati,” which ranks with his
“Madame Sussia” in the Tate. There is an
interesting portrait of Caspar John; also a
drawing of Mrs. Derwent Lees, wife of the
Australian artist, whose work will be seen
for the first time in Australia at this show.
Most of the local artists have fairly lived
among the pictures in the last few days,
though the exhibition isn’t yet open to the
public.
The New Conservatorium at Sonora
House, now controlled by Violet Somerset
and Winifred Lloyd, had an official open-
ing with speechifying, music and tea. Mrs.
Colin Fraser, in black and white, with fox
furs and velvet millinery, did the launching,
and announced that she had presented a
scholarship. Thomas Brentnall also had a
word to say.
As president of the Association of Braille
Writers, Mrs. Russell Grimwade, pictured
here by Broothorn, is ever on the alert to
devise means
of raising
funds for the
i n s t itution.
Last year,
while on a

land with her

struck her
that the adver-
tising posters
of the Empire
M a r k e ting

make a lucra-

bition. T h e
board present-
ed her with a

these will be
shown to-day
at the Orient
Co.’s offices.
The show, which Avas organised by Mrs.
Arnold Johnson, will be launched by knight
George Julius.
At the opening of the year’s activities at
Albert-street Con. vice-director Harold
Elvins addressed the students, director Fritz
Hart being still in Honolulu. Mrs. Fritz
Hart, in black georgette relieved with white,
greeted the visitors, who included Mrs. T.
A. Patterson, Mrs. W. Cass, Mrs. Stuart
Cross, Mrs. Bernard Heinze and City
Organist McKie.
There was the usual exodus of city guns
from Melbourne for the opening of the duck
season, the country around the Kerang
swamps looking like a military camp and
the rivers like a Viennese carnival. A man
on the Tambo River in Gippsland got one
ahead of the urban sportsmen by throwing
bits of liver into the stream for some days
before the due date. On the opening even-
ing he distributed this largesse as usual, but
tied with strings and with hooks inside. Just
before the barrage opened he drew IS fat
birds to land. A city man was caught with
nearly twice the permitted quota of 20 birds.
Without a moment’s hesitation he pointed
to a perfect stranger and said “That lot
belongs to him.” With equal promptitude
the stranger said, “That’s so, inspector.”
threw the bag into his car and drove aAvay.
Holy Trinity, Kew, saw the wedding of
Flight-Lieutenant Frank N. Wright, elder
son of the W. V. Wrights, of Kalgoorlie
(W.A.), and Valmai, only daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. W. Wilson Whalley, of Studley
Park, Kew. The bride’s trained robe of
ivory-tainted angel-skin with clouds of tulle
Avas contrasted with the green flat crepe
gowns with velvet sleeves worn by the two
attendant ’maids, who had pink roses
wreathing their hair. Air Force unifonns
diversified the background. There was a
dance afterwards at No. 9 Highbury Grove,
Kew.
The Rev. Frederick Porter, whose folk
live in England, pledged his troth at St.
John’s, East Malvern, to Nancye, daughter
of the Harold J. Philps, of East Malvern.
The bride’s attire combined ivory satin and
old lace, and she Avore a wreath of orange
buds. Three ’maids in Avine-red flat crepe
sported wreaths of rowan berries.
At St. Pat.’s Cathedral Father Power tied
the knot between his sister Beryl and Arthur
Sutton. The bride, a daughter of the J. J.
Powers, of Beechwortli, mingled limerick
lace and ivory flat crepe in her attire, and
her three ’maids were a symphony in blue
and old gold, carrying sheaves of delphiniums
against their deep yellow frocks.

Jean, eldest daughter of the Frank Thoms,
of Armadale, dx, changed vows with Norman,
elder son of the Rev. David and Mrs. Millar,
of the same place, wearing ivory-toned silk
crepe with an embroidered tulle veil. Her
sister Enid attended her in parchment-
colored lace with rose-red velvet sash, match-
ing slippers and a toque of the same shade
as the frock. Following the ceremony at
the Armadale kirk there were rejoicings at
the Oxford Club.
A Melbourne painter—a good one, too —
still a respectable front to the
world, although he hasn’t sold a picture
since 1930. One of his devices is to salvage
his sisters’ discarded stockings. They have
no feet to-them, but they cover the bit of
leg between the tops of his boots and his
trousers satisfactorily.
Adelaide amenities :
Molly Mcßride, who was bridesmaid at the Kings-
ford Smith nuptials, made her appearance as a bride
when her very quiet marriage was celebrated at
midday in the Lady Ohapel, St. Peter’s Cathedral.
The ’groom was Leonard Osmond-Pound, of Ceylon.
Norman Mcßride came from his station to give his
daughter away. She wore a cream lace frock and
straw hat to tone; her bouquet of pale pink water
lilies was tied with pink tulle. Nancy Holden was
bridesmaid in green organdie, with touches of white,
and a wide-brimmed white hat wreathed with flowers.
John Mcßride, the bride’s brother, was best man.
Mrs. Trevor Davies, of England, who has been
spending some time in- Adelaide on a visit to her
daughter, Mrs. D. Leslie Todd, of Kensington Park,
gave a large farewell afternoon bridge party in the
panel-room at Bilk’s Piccadilly restaurant. The
hostess, who leaves by the Mongolia, wore a smart
beige and blue flowered chiffon frock with a black
straw hat.
. The Adelaide Hospital Auxiliary held a farewell
tea in its clubrooms on North-terrace for Mrs.
L. L. Hill, prior to her departure for England.
Mrs. Hill has been secretary of the auxiliary for
some years, and in appreciation of her services
Mrs. T. R. Scarfe (president) made her a presen-
tation.
An Adelaide four will leave this week to try for
the Stradbroke Cup at Moonee Valley. The- party
includes Mr. and Mrs. F. W. Porter, Mr. Cecil
Bray and his daughter Phyllis, Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth
Bakewell and Mr. M. J. Noonan.
The engagement is announced of the Michael
Hawkers’ second daughter, Lilias, to Richard, son
of the late Mr. and Mrs. R. J. Needham, of
Parkside.
The reception to the Tongan Choir at the Town
Hall on Saturday morning showed that the visitors
speak English fluently. Unfortunately our weather
has given several of them serious colds, and so they
were obliged to go into hospital and postpone their
concert.
Miss May Morris was hostess at a party in the
panel-room at the Piccadilly restaur-ant prior to
her departure for Melbourne. The guests were
entertained with old-time songs and dances, together
with carnival novelties.
A word from the West:—
Mrs. Rischbieth opened up Unalla to give the
Women’s Service Guilds and others interested an
opportunity of meeting Miss Clara Codd. The
hostess wore black with a sprinkling of autumn
blossoms; Miss Codd also chose black with shell-
pink relief. Teacups rattled in the dining-room and
on the verandahs and guests overflowed upon the
lawns. Miss Codd proved herself a woman, of person-
ality and charm. She is sponsored by the Inter-
national Theosopliical Society and is engaged on a
world tour of lectures.
Parties are being sprung for Vera S'aw, who is
to marry Conrad Chase at the end of the week.
Vera came to Edna Noble’s pink tea wearing green
and white stripes. Marjorie Calthrop was another
hostess. Her guests played bridge and she looked
after their comfort in a cobweb of black tulle.
Peggy Watson-Williams welcomed a swarm of the
young and fair to an 11 o’clock brew, and the
bride-to-be took home a larder full of succulent
accessories from. Tynka Salom’s grocery tea.
Jean Norman has announced her engagement to
R. G. Royal, who hails from Toorak, Adelaide.
The Pleiades Club made merry in celebration of
its' birth. At the formal opening ceremony Mrs.
Sydney Stubbs, in black marocain with a wine-red
pattern upon the yoke, performed the official key-
turning. The president, Mrs. George Norton, wore
flowered crepe de Chine and carried gold roses.
Ethel Treadgold in crisp white organdie, sang of
blossom time. Jean Herbert and Margaret Sharpe
performed upon piano and violin. The dramatic
committee looked after the evening’s entertainment
of tableaux, competitions and a brace of playlets.
A bridge party and a dance provided fun for two
other evenings.
The Moulden lady finds air travel to her liking.
She returned per Hercules to Adelaide after a brief
visit here.
Tas. talk :—■
Mrs. Tom Giblin and Mrs. H, S. Barnett ran one
of the most successful of the season’s dances at
Lindfield. The gardens looked lovely, dahlias with
streamers in blue and gold decorated the ballroom,
and the supper tables were a study in pink. Mrs.
Barnett wore a collar of coque feathers, daring but
effective ; Mrs. Tom Giblin sheathed her slimness in
white crepe.
In the absence of Olive Wilton, Fred Brough is
producing the first play of the Hobart Repertory
• Society’s season. “This "Woman Business,’’ by Ben
Levy, has been chosen.
Major and Mrs. Vowles leave Hobart for the
mainland in March. They have made a big circle
of friends in the Speck.
Kathleen Synfonds, popular daughter of District
Naval Officer arid Mrs. Symonds, lately transferred
to Adelaide, writes of her engagement to Captain
J. McKinna, of that city.
Leslie Laurier and his amateurs ran the comedy
“Baby Mine’’ for a three nights’ season at the
National Theatre. The play was well cast and
well mounted and well attended.
The young Hoggs, Ishbel and Dr. Tim, had
hardly a minute to call their own before leaving
on their trip to Mrs. Robert Wall
headed a committee which organised a gay little
dance in the Soldiers’ Memorial Hall at Hadspen,
when some 70 dancers ran out by car from Launces-
ton. Mrs. W. K. Mclntyre gave a theatre party and
supper in the travellers’ honor and there were
numberless bridge and cocktail parties.
Threescore young folk and a very few older ones
descended on the Alan Maxwells at their home near
Brown’s River for a night of dancing and fun.
The long living-room had a roaring fire at once
end ; the square hall was set out for bridge, Jean
Maxwell is ,one of this season’s debs.; her sister
Sheila came out last year. Their young sailor
brother brought several shipmates.
Yet another artist who is entranced by the
Speck’s scenic possibilities is Mrs. Dickson-Patterson,
who is out here from the Cold Country on a visit
to her sister, Mrs. C. P. Andrews, of Launceston.

The Power of Ma-fura.
BY R. EYON BUTCHART.
1 CAN’T say that I hold much' with these
legends and superstitions that surround
the so-called witch-doctors of the Pacific.
There’s no doubt most of them are legends
and nothing more. When one has sailed
the Southern Seas for twenty years and
more, one notices that he. hears about these
things but mighty rarely sees them. I sup-
pose that is really why the incident of Ma-
fura and Snocker Malone always intrigues
me.
Snocker came aboard at Kai-Moroa, and,
like his infernal clieek, made straight for me.
He wouldn’t take no for- an answer.
“They say Captain Coker never turns a
man down if he’s willing to work,” he said
in extenuation of his application for a job.
“I’m willing to work, skipper:”
Well, that rather put me 'in a hole.- I
suppose . I had , got. a reputation like that.
I’d have been a rich man long before this
if I could have learned to harden my heart
a little oftener.
In the long run, Snocker' got his job ; even
Gibbons, my chief, had' to admit lie was a
good worker.' But that was all. If one could
judge of physiognomy, Snocker was one of
the worst ever. I often wondered what crime
it was that had driven him on the beach
at Kai-Moroa, the most God-forsaken hole
in two thousand leagues' of blue ocean.
However, things went along quietly enough
until we got to Lo-lungo. We had to lie up
there for two days. Just a day too many
for Snocker. It didn’t take him long to
learn about Ma-fura, the most celebrated
witch-doctor for a thousand miles. Every-
body who came to Lo-lungo heard of him.
The island was actually a sort of Mecca for
the sick and ailing natives for hundreds of
miles round. If the tales one heard were
true, Ma-fura certainly possessed extra-
ordinary gifts of healing.
It seemed, too, that he was a healer in the
best sense of the word. His services were
not for sale. He had never been known to
ask a reward. It did not, of course, follow
that he was a poor man. Far from it. If
reports were to be believed, he had a fairly
large collection of pearls, to say nothing of
other wealth, hidden away in his hut. For
tlie natives are grateful to a fault for any
such cures as men like Ma-fura are supposed
to work, and insist on paying all they can
afford. Naturally, some of them—-and white
men too —had paid in pearls.
Another rumor that was current about
Ma-fura was that he lived alone : in his hut,
and had, as sole protection, one of those hell-
spawn known as n’goma. God knows whether
the very existence of n’goma is not just
another of the myths that circulate in those
waters. Personally I have never seen one—
nor ever want to! From all accounts the
creature is half-spider, half-bat, an ungainly,
loathsome object which, despite its clumsy
build, can strike with the rapidity of light-
ning. Its bite is fatal within a minute, and
there is no case on record of recovery of
its victim. It is. supposed to breed only once
in seven years, and then only when the rainy
season is long overdue.
However, whether that is so or not, it
was common gossip that one of these crea-
tures was the only guard Ma-fura had. Pre-
sumably'Ma-fura relied on the superstitious
awe in which the natives held him as
sufficient protection—unless the legend of the
n’goma were true.
We were due to sail at midnight on the
second day of our stay at Lo-lungo. By
sheer chance I happened to be ashore about
nine o’clock. I was just coming back to
the boat when I saw, sneaking down a side-
lane, a figure which I recognised as that of
Malone. It was obvious he was up to no
good. Seeing that I had stretched a point
to give him a job, I felt it was a pretty
scurvy trick for him to play up at the first
port wo called at. Lord only knows why
I didn’t bail him up at once, but something
prompted me to follow him. I patted my
pocket to make sure tlie revolver—a constant
companion on shore—was there, and then
did my clumsy best to stalk him.
It was not a difficult job. I don’t think
Malone dreamed that anybody would dare
to follow him where he was going. And that
was soon obvious as he left the town be-
hind him! There could be only one thing
outside the town that could attract him at
that hour of night—Ma-fura’s hut.
Half an hour’s trip brought him to the
edge of the clearing. It was a dark night,
and I could just make out his form as he tip-
toed towards the hut. I saw the door open
and Malone slip inside. Then I myself crept
across the clearing. The last few yards I
crawled flat. I had no wish to silhouette
myself against the open door.
A light was burning in the hut, a flicker-
ing flame of a palm-oil lamp, but it was
sufficient to light up the scene. Ma-fura,
old and wrinkled, was lying on a eocoanut
mat, staring up at Malone.
“So you have come, white man?” he said,
but there was no fear in his voice; only
great contempt, and a sly chuckle as though
he were looking forward to a pleasant night’s
entertainment. “So you have come? You
are not content with killing my grand-
daughter?”
I saw Malone stiffen. But he did not
move. It was as though the old man held
him at the point of some invisible sword.
Ma-fura nodded.
“You remember —the little girl at Lola-
Panga? The one who loved you so much
that the only way you could get away from
her was to kill, her.”
An inarticulate sound escaped from
Malone’s lips. The old man nodded.
“You think it strange that I should know?”
He chuckled, but there was nothing pleasant
or friendly in the sound. “Oh, I have been
waiting for you! I knew you would come.
You see, my spells are powerful,- even over
the white man.” Hi_& voice hardened.
“Especially such brothel-spawn as you !”
Malone took a step forward. My hand
closed over the butt of my revolver more
tightly. But it was not needed yet.
“Don’t move, white man!” Ma-fnra’s voice
was almost caressing. “I have still some
words to say to you before I call n’goma!”
Malone stood rigid. Even from where I.
•lay I could almost imagine that I saw his-
pupils dilate at the name of that ghastly
creature.
“N’goma be ——!” Malone’s voice was
harsh with simulated courage. “Tell that to
the birds!” But he did not move any further
towards Ma-fura.
The old man shrugged: “So? You do not
believe Ma-fura? Well, we shall soon see.”
He eyed the other. His voice was soft and
gentle. “It was the pearls that you wanted,
white man? The pearls—how you love
them ! Pearls of the sea—and pearls of the
land. Fair women—trusting, innocent chil-
dren, scarce grown to womanhood! Pah!”
He spat at Malone. Still Malone remained
as though rooted. I had the idea that had
I been in Malone’s shoes, with those bright
bird-like eyes fixed on me, I also should
have remained motionless. Then, a world of
venom and of hatred in the gentle voice:
“And how you would defile those precious
pearls that lie hidden in my hut, just as you
defiled Gnae-Oli, who, many years ago, lay
in these my arms after her mother had borne
her.”
Suddenly his voice lost its gentleness. He
stretched out a skinny arm towards Malone.
His words were clear, bell-like :
“To-night, white man, you die!”
Again Malone made as though to move.
Ma-fura seemed to liold him with the power
of his eye.
“Wait!” The word was an imperious
command.
Suddenly Ma-fura chuckled, and then
whistled, a peculiar, almost sensuous mote.
Before the sound had died from his lips I
there came a sound of wings. In the -half-
light of the palm-oil torch I saw an ungainly
shape dart from the rafters where, until
then, tlie shadows had hidden it. Straight
as an arrow it went to Malone’s forehead,
poised there an instant . and then, as
Malone’s scream of terror rang through the
hut, it was gone again, lost in the shadows
of the roof.
Ma-fura nodded slowly. His eyes still held
Malone’s.
“N’goma, white man! You are dying.”
His words lost nothing by the lowness of
the tone in which they were spoken. “You
are dying. Within the minute you will be.
dead. And Ma-fura’s pearls will be safe—
as will the sweet, innocent pearls of a
hundred islands.”
Even as Ma-fura spoke I saw Malone’s
knees- crumple under him. Another ten
seconds, and he was lying on the floor,
motionless.
Ma-fura looked at him for a moment.
Then, without moving his gaze, he spoke
again.
“You may come in, white, man at the
door.’’ I started, and he chuckled. “It was
good of. you to come to protect me. But
Ma-fura needs no protection other than his”
—again he chuckled, and I shivered—“his
n’goma.”
I came slowly into _the hut. Malone was
lying on his ■ back. His- sightless eyes stared
up to a heaven he would surely never know,
and on his forehead' there was a tiny hole,
very much like a small bullet might have
made.
Ma-fura chuckled as he saw me looking
at that hole.
“A rapid death, white man,” he murmured.
“But not painless. I can promise you that
that brothel-spawn suffered agony before he
died.”
From the awful contortion of the dead
man’s features, I felt that Ma-fura spoke
nothing but the truth.
“He came to rob you,” I murmured, for
want of anything better to say. I could not
express any regret that Malone was dead.
Ma-fura nodded. “As others before him
have done,” he answered. “And he died, as
did the others.”
I could not repress an involuntary shiver
and a glance towards the roof.
Ma-fura chuckled.
“N’goma?”' he queried. “You would like
to see my n’gohia?”
I wanted to say no. An insensate dread
of the beastly creature possessed me. At
last I knew that there must be truth in the
rumor, .so widespread through the islands.
The n’goma did. in fact, exist.
It was as though Ma-fura read my
thoughts, for he chuckled again. But this
time there - was only an almost childish
enjoyment in the old man’s merriment. As
he squatted on his cocoanut mat, from which
he had not moved throughout the queer pro-
ceedings, he looked very old and wrinkled,
as though the wisdom of centuries must be
accumulated behind those bird-like eyes.
Suddenly his lips pursed, and another
whistle came from them. Even as I crouched,
as though to avoid the attack of the n’goma
I noticed that the note was different.
Again there came the winging sound. But
this time the creature hovered gently over
Ma-fura’s head for a moment before per chi no-
on his uplifted hand. He extended his hand"
with the bird perched on it, for my inspec-
tion. Again he chuckled.
“Look well, white man,” he told me I
felt his eyes burning into mine, and, despite
a craven fear of the n’goma that had sud-
denly been born in my mind, I could not
resist the compulsion.
A moment later Ma-fura nodded confirma-
tion of the incredulity in my eyes.
“A bat, white man,” he said simply
harmless bat, well trained. That is mv
n’goma.” J
I did not dare to ask him. how he had
killed Malone. But since that day, when anv
well-meaning_ passenger, tries., to draw me
on the question of witch-doctors, I answer
guardedly with my .stock phrase ;
. “Well, of. course, there may be something
in their, so-called powei'3. Strange things
can happen in the Southern Seas.”
