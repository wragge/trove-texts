MELBOURNE
It's a tough job
now keeping up
with the Joneses
NOW LOOK HERE. We have Mrs.
Jones the margarine lady, we have
Susan Jones the air hostess, we have
Andrew Jones the politician, we have
Barry Jones the quiz king, and we
have Barry Jones the Melbourne
detective. Never was keeping up with
the Joneses more difficult.
Actually keeping up with Barry
Jones the detective is more difficult
than keeping up with some of the other
Joneses, like young Andrew. Jones the
detective is the father of quadruplets,
and his happy face has been beaming
at us from the front pages of Mel-
burnian newspapers for more than a
week past. The successful birth has
been Melbourne’s triumph, and Mrs.
Joanne Jones has given us a description
of her four children. Andrea Louise:
“A glamor girl, but big enough to look
after herself.” Carolyn Maree: “A bit
of mystery, always sleepy.” Susan Eliza-
beth: “A real little fighter, always
awake.” Dean Stewart: “A little placid,
but he’s very long. He’ll be a footballer
like his father.”
But the really interesting feature is
the publicity gained for the fertility
“pill” gonadatrophin as against the
non-fertility pill progesterone.
It is only a few weeks since the
“Current Affairs Bulletin” of the Uni-
versity of Sydney produced a very in-
teresting paper titled “Pills and Popu-
lations.” It gave an estimate that
there were 500,000 users of the pill in
Australia. That is, about one in every
five women of an age to bear children
(ages 15-49) used the pill. On a
population basis this is about 3.5
times the rate of consumption of the
U.K. and 50 percent higher than that
of the U.S.A. According to the CAB
figures this would imply that we are
the pill champions of the world. And we
achieve these figures even with a high
proportion of Roman Catholics, 23
percent of the population.
The CAB also said that our birth
rate was down to 19.61 a 1000 for
1965, the lowest for 22 years, and it
sank again to 19.1 for the first half
of 1966. However, the CAB was scep-
tical that this was all due to the
pill. Probably the birth rate would
have declined anyway. The truth is
that the fertility pill will not overcome
the non-fertility pill. In Melbourne the
fertility work is undertaken by a small
research team at the Endocrine Clinic
at the Royal Women’s Hospital. The
doctors there say that gonadatrophin
can help only about one percent of
women. Mrs. Joanne Jones was treated
with this drug after she had failed to
have children for seven years. The
gonadatrophin is produced in the hos-
pital’s laboratories from extracts of
pituitary glands. The hospital’s tally
of babies born through the use of it
is now 28. The first was rather spec-
tacular, the Lawson quintuplets, born
in New Zealand in 1965. Now there
have been 10 single births, three twins,
one set of triplets, and the Jones quads.
Several newspapers mentioned that
the Jones quads were the fifth set born
in Victoria in the past 50 years. But
your pioneer is a little saddened that
none mentioned the Ferrers sextuplets.
Could one refer you to the “Port Phillip
Gazette” of August 28, 1841: “A woman
of the name of Ferrers, living in the
district of Grange (Warrnambool), was
brought to bed on 3rd of July last of
six children at one birth, a circumstance
we suppose unparalleled in the records
of medical history.
“The mother is wife to an industrious
and honest man following the labor of
splitter and fencer. She is Irish by birth,
came out in one of Marshall’s vessels,
and is 26 years of age.
“The only remarkable symptom she
experienced was in the growth •of an
inordinate appetite, her husband having
been obliged to purchase an extra ration
for her during pregnancy.
“She was first ill on the Ist of July,
had several pains during that and the
following day, and was in actual labor
16 hours. The children are, or either
were, all girls. One, however, the first,
was stillborn, and two died afterwards.
Fortunately, the poor woman had
several female acquaintances who took
care of the little strangers and consoled
her. Under the prospects of starvation
that attended their first appearance, she
is now suckling two herself whilst her
eldest girl feeds and nurses the third.
They are remarkably thriving, and the
mother, recovered from the fright and
wonder attendant upon so extraordinary
a birth, is getting quite proud of her
offspring.
“During the period of labor she
was fed at intervals with a teaspoonful
of hot brandy and water. Living in that
distant part of the country she had no
other luxury or remedy to resort to.
“We have often heard of the fruitful
nature of the climate and its wonder-
ful effects in assisting the disappointed
passion of philoprogenitiveness, but
could scarcely credit it unless assured
from such undeniable sources of truth.”
The old-fashioned philoprogenitive
powers of Mr. and Mrs. Ferrers were
plainly quite as potent as anything
happening now with gonadatrophin.


THE ONLY THING
EXPENSIVE ABOUT
THESE WINES
IS THE TASTE
It's a wonderful thing to be able to
find a wine that is more-ishly
quaffable and at the same time
inexpensive.
Both light, delicate Miamba Hock,
and smooth, soft Miamba Claret
with its appealing finish, are
extremely well made wines —the
top show awards they have won,
both overseas and in Australia, are
evidence of this.
But both are moderately priced as
well as being very, very quaffable.
See for yourself!

OUT AND
ABOUT
There's nothing
loose about this
Scoundrel
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
DEFINITELY, but definitely, men’s
swimsuits will not be worn loose this
year. They will ker-ling. They will be
short. And long. With stretch backs
and taut fronts. Sort of sneaky girdles
without built-in support.
Actually, Alex Blain, Jantzen’s mar-
keting director, calls this ambiguous
state of affairs the masculine, virile
look. Miss Barbara White, an ardent
Girl Guide (she wore her uniform to
the office once, lanyard, whistle, and
all) until her appointment as director
of the Style Development Department,
agrees. “It’s the cut, you see,” explains
Mr. Blain, who wears a smile and a
thick navy-blue cardigan, and rocks
back and forth in a rasping chair, curl-
ing his hair round and round his
fingers. “Absolutely square, straight
across the thigh and hip. Wouldn’t you
say it was the cut, Miss White?”
Definitely. Oh, there was a loose look,
all right, a couple of years ago during
the Jam era a kind of pyjama cut
off at the knee but Jams never
caught on. Miss White never thought
they would. What’s flattering, she asks,
about a lot of flapping, baggy
material?
Inside this birthplace of masculine,
virile swimwear near Parramatta, with
Fords and the State Abattoir as neigh-
bors, there are girls tabulating mono-
tonously on typewriters; middle-aged
men in shirt sleeves discussing footie
beside the Dracena indivisia: a popular
plant, says its label, for inside and out,
so long as it’s kept fresh with liquid
manure; and some tired salesmen amble
in and trample over the famous Diving
Girl symbol imprinted in static flight
on the rubber reception floor. She
started life 58 years ago, wearing socks
and a beanie cap. Over the years she
got what Alex Blain calls sleeker, but
now, compared with Twiggy, her
curves are almost obscene. Well,
obvious. They experimented, putting a
man with her for male swimwear, but
the combination didn’t take. Anyway,
an American survey proves she is the
most recognised symbol in the entire
apparel industry.
Mr. Blain, formerly with electrical
computors and business machines, is
on his fifth cup of coffee this morning,
and Miss White is bordering on excite-
ment about the season’s new blinding
colors and saying checks and stripes
the geometries, you know, are more
with-it than florals. “Let’s get 1M62
Sunbeat with back stretch out, and
IM6I Dare Devil—no, it’s IM6O Hot
Dogger with simulated fly front or
wait a minute, is it 1M63 Demigod with
back waist drawcord?” The thing is,
Miss White is involved with 1968’s
range now, it’s difficult to remember
this year’s.
It doesn’t matter. The point is, with
all this trendy swimwear about, the
man who takes to the beach in Boxers
is absolutely marked as 40 or over
and/or married to a wife who wants
to keep his image square. It is the 15-
to 35-year-old group who will auto-
matically swing to ker-ling. Mr. Blain
can prove it but won’t say how. What
happens to the lost 35-40 group is any-
one’s guess. “However,” Mr. Blain
curls his hair frantically with both
hands, “I think it would be an accurate
statement to say categorically that the
Bombay Bloomer has had its chips.”
He speaks with authority, having just
returned from Jantzen’s annual inter-
national conference held this year in
Athens. A sort of United Nations
affair, swimming fraternity from round
the world, interpreters, microphones,
earphones, and everything. Mr. Blain
had terrible trouble understanding the
German translation, but, otherwise, says
everyone looks to Australia as leaders
in swimwear. He also has the Marquess
MacSwinis—Mr. Blain looked him up
and thinks it’s a Papal title, anyway
he’s not a con man —keeping an aristo-
cratic eye on silhouettes in Europe; and
Miss White’s department subscribes to
every fashion magazine in the world.
The, result of all this research is a
quarter of a million men’s bathers
made up of 70 frantic fashion styles
and ten dreary basics well, who can
get worked up over racers with and
without skirts for unhampered swim-
ming? Or, come to that, a Rescue and
Resuscitation suit which comes in plain
old green and navy? Last year their
gimmick was a Long John: trunks with
shoulder-straps, explains Miss White.
“No,” corrects Mr. Blain, “braces.”
They looked marvellous for window
display, but no one bought them. This
year they’ve gone no further than a
basque front, laced up like corsets.
Kevin, the house model, appears in
2M33 Scoundrel, a red and blue Pacific
Block Check surfer, and asks should
he remove his shirt and tie? Turn
round, says Mr. Blain curtly,
Kevin’s back view confirms there is
nothing loose about Scoundrel. Actu-
ally, says Kevin, he’s got to give up
modelling. His waistline’s gone up
from 32 to 34 inches.
On the way out through reception
Mr. Blain turns to examine Diving
Girl. Maybe she is a bit urn
developed. They’re making him man-
aging director soon. Perhaps he will
fine her down a fraction.


CONNOISSEUR
REDS
NOTES FROM LIN DEMAN'S
CELLAR MANAGER:
After several years of small vintages in
the Hunter River Valley which de-
pleted Lindeman’s cellar stocks of dry
reds, we are pleased to be able to an-
nounce the release of an important col-
lection of matured dry red table wines
of the highest quality. All of the wines
below are ready to drink now and
should be represented in every con-
noisseur’s cellar, where they will con-
tinue to improve without a shadow of
doubt for many years to come.
1963 HUNTER BURGUNDY
BIN 2585

grown at Lindeman’s Ben Ean Vine-
yard, Hunter River Valley, N.S.W.
Awarded:
FIRST PRIZE 1964 Melbourne Show.
SILVER MEDAL 1963 Brisbane Show.
SILVER MEDAL 1964 Adelaide Show.
As a 1963 Vintage Burgundy.
1963 RESERVE CLARET
BIN 2565
HUNTER RIVER BLEND
Vintaged from Red Hermitage grapes
grown at Lindeman’s vineyards in the
Hunter River Valley, Coonawarra and
Clare. A medium claret with a delicate
appealing flavour and clean astringency.
1964 OEILLADE —SHIRAZ
BIN 2940
LANGHORNE’S CREEK, S.A.
This wine was made from Oeillade
and Shiraz grapes grown at Langhorne’s
Creek in the Southern Adelaide ranges.
It is a light, delicate claret with a
pronounced varietal flavour and charac-
ter, in which the Oeillade grapes soften
and lighten the typical full Shiraz.

The pleasant way
to get an extra
lift aloft
MARK BURNS, the romantic and
sabre lead of Tony Richardson’s latest
film, “The Charge of the Light
Brigade,” said to me at Frankfurt air-
port, “Of course, the only possible way
to fly nowadays is to eat, drink, and
be merry.”
He was returning to Istanbul after
receiving treatment in London for a
wrist he had broken in the cavalry
charge. Probably a cannon to left of
him. I accepted his excellent com-
pany and advice for the next few hours,
and proceeded to enjoy his theory. Of
course, it is quite easy to get a glow on
in flight, especially when travelling
first class with Pan American. (All
drinks are free!)
Even Economy or One-Class and
paying, there is still plenty of oppor-
tunity. There is a profusion of aperitifs,
spirits, beers, liqueurs, and digestifs.
There is also a profusion of wine.
Two years ago in a Bulletin article
I lamented the lack of wine on local
domestic flights. The situation remains
much the same, though I understand
that “something is being done.” If
not, it should be. In that article I
mentioned the Pan American claim that
they were the greatest single purchasers
of wine in the world. They get through
something like half a million bottles a
year. And though, with typically good
public relations, they serve Australian,
Argentinian, Italian, Portuguese, Ger-
man, and even Californian wine on
some flights, more than 80 percent of
their wine comes from France. Recent
visits to New York and Paris afforded
a chance to poke my ever-twitching
nose into this situation.
The wines are gathered from the
main areas of France by two great wine
notables, Monsieur Louis Vaudable, the
owner of Maxim’s, and the famous
Sommelier of the restaurant, Pommier.
Maxim’s is still their first love, though
there are now a number of other respon-
sibilities with the frozen-food opera-
tion and wine purchasing for Pan Am
and many hotels. Thoroughly indoctri-
nated with the Franz Lehar “I go oft
to Maxim’s, Where fun and frolic
beams” bit, I went there expecting an
establishment living on reputation, a
gay duchess over-rouged to hide the
marks of the march. Instead I found
the simplicity of great quality, superb
food, a wonderful cellar, unobtrusive
but highly knowledgeable and efficient
staff. Just great. It seems almost
churlish to mention that Franz Lehar
never visited Maxim’s. He couldn’t
afford to.
Maxim’s two experts seek samples and
examine them from two points of view.
Pommier is interested in the complete
integrity of the wine; does it represent
truly the district of origin, is it con-
sistent with the same marque of
previous years, is it a good or indif-
ferent example of a particular vintage,
how long will it keep and mature, when
will it be at its best? Monsieur
Vaudable, though recognised as one of
the great palates of France, thinks in a
more businesslike way; will this please
the majority of wine-drinking pas-
sengers, is there efcough available, will
it hold up at 35,000 feet, is it likely to
crust and therefore prove difficult to
serve in flight, will it travel and travel
and travel? With the two analyses in
mind, Louis Vaudable then makes his
recommendations to New York. A
small but august committee takes over;
Messrs. Milley, Wilson, and Treadwell,
respectively the vice-president in
charge of Services, the director of Flight
Services, and the manager of Food
and Beverages. They examine the lists,
note current consumption, anticipate
future needs, and then fly to Paris to
taste the stuff. (“Oh, darling, hold din-
ner up for a while, will you? I’m pop-
ping over to Paris, France, to taste
some wine.”)
The complete tasting panel meets at
least once, and often twice a year to
deliberate. And then they buy. Cham-
pagne by the thousand cases, hundreds
of dozen of top Bordeaux, burgundies
by the bullock load. How good are these
wines?
Being offered a chance to taste, I
accepted. I was immediately impressed
with the Bordeaux reds. Most of them
came from the unfashionable year of
1960. The reasons for this are fairly
obvious. The wines of that year are
slightly cheaper because they are sand-
wiched between the great vintages of
1959 and 1961. And the slightly lighter
wines of 1960 will mature quicker and
are not likely to crust excessively. Not
that 1960 was a bad year. I compare it
to 1948, another sandwiched year, the
fame of the 1947 s and 1949 s no doubt
being well known to you. The 1948 s are
still very drinkable, and there have
been many pleasant surprises among
them. I bought quite a few very reason-
ably and have never had a bad bottle.
Anyway, of the 1960 s I was particu-
larly impressed with the Ghateau
Latour, a wine that often shows at its
best in an “off” year. Still a big wine,
with a rich and heavy bouquet and
considerable tannin evident, it will live
for years, though very good drinking
now. Next was the 1960 Chateau
Mouton Rothschild, with a big cigar-
box Cabernet nose and full flavor,

though not quite the finesse of the
previous wine. The 1960 Chateau
Lafite Rothschild was not up to the
same standard, being rather thin and
lacking in style, with a delicate, slightly
“effeminate” nose. No guts. Of the
second-growth wines (still among the
top 20 of 4000 wines in the area!) I
was surprised by the 1960 Chateau Leo-
ville-Lascases. This had a full, rich
bouquet and plenty of flavor, but what
impressed was the complete harmony
and balance of the wine. Had more
than a taste of this one!
The champagnes were champagnes
were champagnes. Delightful, wonderful
drink, my favorite wine in the air.
Many of the great were there, Moet and
Chandon, Pommery and Greno, Heid-
seck, et al. And, of course, great vint-
ages, since only the best years are de-
clared in champagne, the rest being
blended and sold as non-vintage.
The disappointment was the red
burgundies. A Chambolle-Musigny 1964
was the best of them, being agreeable,
with pleasant flavor and softness. I
didn’t like a 1964 Cote de Beaune Vil-
lages, thin and tired and lacking in
character. I know that the Bourgogne
produces often less than a tenth of the
wine vintaged in Bordeaux and that de-
mand is great. But I cannot reconcile
myself to these thin, gutless wonders. I
would prefer to drink the wines from
farther south, particularly from the
Cotes du Rhone. From this area there
was an excellent example, having full
flavor and nose and a rich, somehow
chewy character on the tongue. This
wine had a very agreeable aftertaste.
There were many others. Good white
burgundies, a fresh, clean white from
Maconnais, and some pleasant dry
Graves headed by a Chateau Carbon-
nieux. Case upon case, stack after stack,
room beyond room. A great deal of
money and a tremendous amount of
effort are devoted by Pan American
Airways to the exercise of providing top
wines for their customers. Naturally
enough, I would like to see more Aus-
tralian wine aloft. The Lindeman’s
wines they serve are well received, and
the white in particular is as good as any
other white served. But, of course, there
is no reason why Pan American should
promote our wines, especially until the
demand is international.
I was imprudent enough to ask if
there was ever any trouble; in spite pf
all this care and attention, were mis-
takes ever made?

‘Urban Man’
in aluminium by sculptor lan Bow.
‘Frontispiece for Ford Fairlane’
in aluminium by Alcoa.
The grille of a modern car is usually sculptural.
Its form can suggest strength, grace, dignity,
or power. And a natural medium for the
creation of such a form is Alcoa aluminium.
It’s such a versatile metal, with an infinite
variety of types and tempers. It can be cast,
rolled, extruded, drawn, forged, stamped or
spun—riveted, brazed, welded or bonded. It is
practical and decorative. There are limitless
applications for this extraordinary metal.
Unlike the usual sculptural forms, the Alcoa
aluminium grille and side mouldings on the
new Fairlane don't stand around on a pedestal
They have to withstand a tremendous amount
of wear and weather. So, the metal in these
exterior trims must be of exceptional quality.
For the side mouldings, Alcoa produced the
rigidly controlled aluminium alloy 5457 —H 25
temper, the first time this quality alloy
has been made in Australia.
But generally, standing up to rough treatment
is no problem to aluminium. It is light, strong,
and naturally resistant to corrosion.
Alcoa aluminium is a superior metal to work
with. Ford has takenadvantage of its versatility.

... until NCR produced
the 500!
Many businesses are not getting the benefits of electronic data
processing because they think that computers are too compli-
cated, too costly. Now the NCR.SOO knocks down every computer
prejudice with a simple, low-cost, easy-to-program magnetic
card system.
With the NCR 500 magnetic card system you
start computing for less than $BOO per month.
The 500 enables you to use the visible records
with,which you are already familiar, yet gives you
all the speed, versatility and power to grow of a
real stored-program computer.
The cards have printed entries on one side, mag-
netic stripe “memories” on the other. Your staff
can read them—and so can the 500. You get the
best of both worlds!
As your business grows, your 500 system can be
expanded to take on more work and do it even
faster and better. There is a wide range of
peripherals, including punched tape and punched
card input/output units and a line printer. You
can add any of them to the 500 at any time
during its long working life.
This means you can choose a system that is fully
utilised on current work, yet be sure that the 500
will keep pace with your data processing needs
for many years ahead.
Above all the NCR 500 is a real computer. It
stores programs in its memory, has all the
flexibility of many bigger, far costlier computers.
Yet programming effort is measured in man-days
and not man-years!
The NCR 500 removes the last barrier to com-
puter use even in the smallest business. Talk
500 computing with NCR—and see at last how
simple and right for your business a real com-
puter can be!

ONE MORE
WEEK
Fine food
THE BULLETIN’S Cellarmaster, just
back from a world tour, didn’t find that
everything in England quite measured
up to British Travel posters. He visited
a 500-year-old pub in Suffolk and
ordered cheese, bread, pickles, and
beer. The cheese was cut off a processed
package, the bread came from a cut-
loaf, the pickles from a cut-price jar,
and the beer, of course, was warm.
Rising in the world
IMPROVISED grandstands are not
permitted at the Melbourne Cricket
Ground. Therefore, it is the custom
for any football-lover to purchase four
cans of Fosters Lager, drink them as
quickly as possible, then, with two cans
under each foot, he is elevated at
least six inches. Carlton and United
Breweries last week introduced the rip-
top can. So now this progression from
can to grandstand will be much quicker
and efficient.
But wait, in two weeks’ time Pen-
folds will introduce the gallon wine
can. It will be decorated like a keg and
it will come with miniature stand and
plastic tap. Inside the can there will
be a plastic sack, so that as the wine
evacuates the sack will collapse, leav-
ing the wine hermetically sealed. The
theory is that it will never go off.
However, one can’t help but think
of the real advantage to wine-lovers.
At the MCG they will be at least six
inches higher than beer-lovers.
Strangled
ALMOST every week, it seems, we
receive some plea about yet another
city plan. A Perth correspondent points
out that when that city’s Stephenson
Plan was finished in 1955 an explana-
tory booklet showed the city across the
Swan River from King’s Park, with
the caption: “Through thoughtful action
in the past, the lovely setting of the
capital city of Western Australia has
been enhanced rather than destroyed.”
Today, as a result of the Stephenson
Plan, the same shopfront view is a
buge pile of sand, part of reclamation
of the river to create a network of
freeways to ring the city and gobble
op more than 40 acres of the river.
Last week the State Government,
oo doubt with an eye on the elections
in a few months’ time, called for a
halt to river reclamation and a review
of the Stephenson Plan. However, the
small group of professionals able to
understand the plan fully see this only
as a minor victory. They maintain the
Stephenson Plan is completely out-
moded, the ring of freeways will simply
throttle growing Perth and, at the
same time, cut the city off from its
river.
Establishing contact
YOU’LL KNOW ME by my yellow
orchid and my purple pantaloons
and I’ll be wearing blue contact
lenses. He wasn’t, of course. When
we met in the foyer of Menzies Hotel,
Sydney, Gareth Powell was wearing
a grey tweed sportscoat, an Australian
haircut, and green contact lenses. He
was unmistakable, though. It has
something to do with his Welsh accent,
his long stride, and the speed of his
conversation, all of which add up to a
kind of joyous exhibitionism.
He is 33, but if one didn’t know
he is a wealthy publisher of books
ranging from “Fanny Hill” and “The
Carpetbaggers” to the poems of Andrew
Marvell and John Donne, one might
take him for a university student enjoy-
ing the end of term. He states firmly
he is not a millionaire (“I was a lot
richer last year in cash terms . . . But
I own things”). And, despite the furore
over his intention to come here as a
$2O migrant, he is delighted with Aus-
tralia.
“I was turning old and grey in
England, and the old class distinction
thing is as bad as ever. In fact, I
think it’s worse—especially in publish-
ing. So I sold my Rolls-Royce and
came to Australia. Here it’s marvellous.
And although Australians haven’t found
out yet, this country is not being left
out of the mainstream. Things do
happen here—that’s what Australia
should tell itself.”
Powell has been here for five weeks
now, five weeks in which he has written
a book on graffiti for Horwitz Publi-
cations, done some editing for the
same company, taken a trip to Adelaide
to do business with Griffin Press, which
will print the magazines he is planning
to publish here, and installed his wife
and two children in a house in Glades-
ville near the office of Gareth Powell
Associates. If he’d tried, he couldn’t
have chosen a better location in which
to shake off the last vestiges of “swing-
ing London,” but he took it because
“the office rent is low and I have an
option on taking over the building.”
“I hope to bring out four magazines
to sell at $l-$1.25 —one an Australian
edition of ‘King,’ which I own a piece
of. Then I want to do a high-adven-
ture, thick-ear Ernest Hemingway, it-
happened-to-me kind of thing. The
third I suppose you could call a cross
between ‘Playboy,’ ‘Esquire,’ and ‘Town’
and I don’t want to talk about the
other one yet.”
Five weeks here have also streng-
thened his ideas about Australian pub-
lishing. “It’s infinitely better than
anyone believes—in the writers they’re
choosing and the designs they’re doing.
And the printers are better than any-
one else in the world. But the pub-
lishers don’t think of abroad. I’m
thinking of Australia as part of the
world market—l’m costing books for
selling abroad and arranging distribu-
tion for the English, and possibly the
American, market.”
Having sold up his British company,
he plans a collection of some variety
for his Australian debut. The first will
be “How To Stay Slim and Healthy
Even If You’re a Fat Slob Like Me,”
which he himself will write and which
may be the first of a series of humorous
books with long titles; then he’ll follow
this up with a cartoon annual and a
series of early Victorian prints. As
well, he’d like to try television with a
program along the lines of Britain’s
“What the Papers Say.”
For a Welsh miner’s son who was
once fired from Four Square Books for
“lack of cultural background,” Gareth
Powell may do very nicely indeed in the
Antipodes.

MICHAEL BAUME WRITES ON THE
ECONOMY
Some sad pangs
about those
foreign takeovers
THERE IS NO POINT crying over
spilt milk chocolate. Naturally there are
regrets all around that a good old firm
like Mac. Robertsons is soon to be taken
over by the British-owned Cadbury
group. But the reason it happened is
that Mac. Robertson’s profits and share
prices had collapsed. And when share
prices fall to only a fraction of the
value of a company’s assets, there is
something almost inevitable about the
rape that follows. After offering some
passive resistance to the American Mars
company that had first crack at them,
Mac. Robertson’s directors now appear
to be heeding the old maxim about re-
laxing and getting what little enjoy-
ment they can out of the experience.
But this takeover can bring little real
pleasure to the Australian public. It
will not bring any worthwhile econ-
omies of scale to Cadbury that are
likely to be passed on to consumers in
cheaper chocolate. The reason behind
Cadbury’s offer seems to be related
more to an enthusiasm about preventing
the U.S. Mars group from having such
a cheap method of entry into the Aus-
tralian market than any restless basic
urge to spread itself into the dominant
role in the industry it is now acquiring
(it will now have two major brands,
Cadbury and Mac. Robertson, along
with Mars itself, some of whose pro-
ducts Mac. Robertson makes here under
licence).
THE LOCAL CHOCOLATE busi-
ness has been hectic enough in recent
times without having an aggressive new-
comer from America carving a slice of
the market for itself. These hectic times
help explain the sudden downturn that
has more than cut Mac. Robertson’s
share price in half. For they come at a
disastrous time for Mac. Robertson,
when it was in the middle of a move
from its old factory to a new $6 million
plant, the financing of which would
have been an expensive enough item
at the best of times. Mac. Robertson
then suffered from some price fluctua-
tions for cocoa and, even worse, from
the breakdown of the retail price
arrangements that had kept chocolate
prices steady around Australia. Under
pressure from the chain grocery stores,
some makers a couple of years ago
began to sell at a discount and cut-
price chocolate broke up the old selling
pattern. This played havoc with Mac.-
Robertson’s profits, even though it
helps to explain the rapid rise of about
seven percent a year in Australian
chocolate consumption.
THE KEY FEATURE of the Mac.-
Robertson affair, however, is that the
chocolate industry will now be domin-
ated from overseas. Only two big Aus-
tralian companies Lifesavers, with
its Smalls and Mastercraft brands, and
Hoadleys will survive in an industry
where the bulk of the business will be
done by the British-owned Cadbury-
Mac. Robertson group and Rowntrees,
and by the Swiss-owned Nestles.
The Mac. Robertson takeover is im-
portant for other reasons, too. Cad-
bury’s offer, the fiftieth made for an
Australian-listed public company in the
past two years, typifies the problem
facing Australian companies if they
falter even temporarily along the pro-
fit road and if their share prices be-
come low enough to provide a cheap
way for a foreign company to get into
the Australian market or expand its
interests here. Of course, there may be
those who say that Cadbury will run
Mac. Robertson a lot better than its old
management did or that the Australian
chocolate industry was too fragmented
to be really efficient, so that it will now
be a better industry. Whether or not
this is true, and it seems unlikely in
this case, it is strictly true of many of
the 49 other takeovers and attempted
takeovers of the past two years. And
takeovers and mergers are regarded as
such an important factor in the drive
to improve British business efficiency
that a Government-appointed board
has been set up to encourage them.
Australia’s big decision is whether
or not we are prepared to pay for this
increased efficiency and sensible ration-
alising by losing control of so many in-
dustries to groups whose first and basic
loyalties lie outside this country. For
22 of the 50 takeover bids or merger
offers made for listed Australian com-
panies in the past two years have come
from foreign owned or controlled com-
panies and in terms of cost and
size these foreign bids represent well
over fifty percent of the total.
It is also striking that almost half
of these 22 foreign bids were made
at a time when the Australian com-
pany involved was suffering from a
depressed share price in some
instances a direct consequence of
mounting competition from foreign-
owned companies.
It is even more striking that these
foreign takeovers have been heavily
concentrated in the food, transport
and agricultural chemical industries*
indicating fairly clearly where foreign
investors judge there will be enough
development and profitability to make
the takeover game worth the candle.
Of course there are other fairly sens-
ible kinds of foreign offers, like
Viyella’s failed bid for Davies Coop,
which had the double virtue for
Viyella of being very cheap and of
giving Viyella a real leg in to Aus-
tralia, and like Alcoa’s joint bid with
Overseas Corporation to acquire
Dowell and so ensure a large semi-
fabrication outlet for Alcoa aluminium.
Yet these foreign bids are only half
the takeover picture; Australian com-
panies are behaving in exactly the
same sort of way. But they are not fol-
lowing the same industry pattern set
by the foreigners. Most of them are
simply horizontal integration; com-
panies spreading sideways to get a
bigger share of their market. (One of
them even involved buying out an un-
successful foreign company, Phillips
Oil Products, in a pleasant reversal of
the usual situation.) Well over half
the takeover bids or mergers made by
Australian companies for other local
companies in the past two years have
been like this; apart from a fair num-
ber of textile companies, they were
widely spread through industry.
THE MOST SURPRISING feature
to emerge from a recent study of take-
overs in Australia is that so few of
them have been for the entire integra-
tion purpose, of securing control of an
end product or a raw material, that
have played such a major part in classi-
cal takeover theory. Sixteen takeovers
out of 50 were clearly for this purpose
in the past two years, with most of
these coming from ready-mixed con-
crete and road-making companies that
wanted to secure their supplies of stone
and blue metal. There have also been
surprisingly few takeovers by company
vampires who seek quick profits out
of dismembering companies they ac-
quire and selling off the bits. Only
three successful takeovers for what
seems to have been this purpose have
come off in the past two years.
All in all, it’s pretty hard to make
any sort of sound case against most
local takeovers. And the situation in
many of the 22 foreign ones may not
be as bad as it appears, since six of
them were merely to formalise or
deepen links already existing for some
years between the local and the foreign
company. Nevertheless, it is difficult
not to feel some pangs about what is
happening in those industries where
foreigners are getting a stake in Aus-
tralia’s future at our expense, not be-
cause they have the vision and fore-
sight to start new enterprises but
because they have the cash to buy us
out.

AS I SEE IT
The art of
sitting back and
doing nothing
By ALAN REID
THERE WAS unhealthiness about the
way in which the Holt Gpvernment re-
ceived the official announcement that
Britain intended to reduce its Singa-
pore-Malaysia strength to sea and air
forces by 1970-71 and to get out com-
pletely by 1975.
It seemed more preoccupied with
why the British Labor Government had
made the decision and the lack of wis-
dom it involved than with the con-
sequences flowing from the decision.
There was even a Micawber-like
hopefulness that for some reason or
other something would turn up to cause
Britain to change its mind before with-
drawal was completed in 1975. The
emphasis was put wistfully and un-
realistically on the fact that Britain had
said “the precise timing of our eventual
withdrawal will depend on progress
made in achieving a new basis of
stability in South-East Asia” rather
than on their fundamental statement
that “we plan to withdraw altogether
from Singapore and Malaysia in the
middle 19705.”
As I see it, the reasons why Britain
made its decisions, and whether they
were wise or unwise, do not matter a
damn from the viewpoint of the prac-
tical politician.
Those nice questions now fall within
the province of the academic and the
historian. What matters are the con-
sequences for Australia that flow from
the decisions.
I find much healthier the reception
given the announcement by Singapore’s
tough-minded Prime Minister Lee Kuan
Yew. Boiled down, Lee’s approach was
that Britain’s decision to pull out was
one that nobody else could make for
them. They made it the way they did
and good luck to them. It created
problems for Singapore. Singapore had
to live with those problems. Its tough-
minded people would solve the prob-
lems. All would be well, provided that
in the nine years’ breathing space
Britain had given before finally pulling
out in 1975 Singapore didn’t just sit
back and do nothing.
Personally, I think it would be
dangerous if the Holt Government con-
tinues lamenting the past rather than
preparing for the future. If, instead of
accepting the unequivocal statement
that Britain is planning a complete
withdrawal by the mid-19705, the
Government prefers to rely on the
ambiguous hint that, under certain un-
disclosed circumstances, Britain might
stay longer in South-East Asia, then
there is a very real danger that Aus-
tralia might, relatively speaking, do
precisely what Lee Kuan Yew has
warned against “sit back and do
nothing.”
This unhealthy preoccupation with
what is virtually water under the
bridge, instead of concentrating upon
the problems of the future, was shown
up by the weakness of the thinking on
the political side.
Despite the claim by the Opposition
leader Gough Whitlam that the British
announcement found the Government
unprepared, the Holt administration
has known for a long time now that
Britain was getting out. Even with my
comparatively limited sources of
information, I have been convinced of
it since 1962. That year, when the
former Prime Minister, Sir Robert
Menzies, tried to persuade Britain not
to persist at that point of time with its
attempts to join the Common Market
(and was ably assisted by General de
Gaulle, who was finally responsible for
the thumbs down on that particular
British attempt), it was clear that all
Australia gained then was a breathing
space. It was a matter of time before
Britain joined the EEC, and pulled out
of South-East Asia.
Allen Fairhall, Defence Minister and
official spokesman for the Government
on defence matters, expressed the
Government viewpoint on likely hap-
penings in South-East Asia repeatedly
during the last election campaign. He
is on record as having reiterated with-
out reservation that Britain would soon
be out of South-East Asia and (amus-
ingly in the light of last week’s British
announcement) having persisted with
his declaration, even after he had been
solemnly contradicted by official British
spokesmen.
Against this background the excuse
that the Government had had no real
opportunity to prepare its collective
mind and think things through cannot
be proffered.
If there is one consequence that
emerges very clearly from the British
decision, it is that the Australia-
United States alliance, always import-
ant, has become all important. With
Britain gone from South-East Asia, the
United States is the only major power
that Australia can look to in the event
of emergency. Any other countries in
the area with which Australia has the
potential to make defence arrange-
ments are, almost without exception,
even less powerful than Australia.
The position could change in the
nine years before Britain finally quits
Lee Kuan Yew has already pointed
out that the collective security 0 f
South-East Asia could be upheld by
countries like Australia, New Zealand
Malaysia, and Singapore. He has also
expressed the hope that by the 1970 s
defence arrangements will have reached
the capability with which Britain was
currently contributing to security in
this part of the world.
But obviously in the nine years’
interval, and particularly after 1970
when Britain’s South-East Asian forces
will be down to naval and air units
the Australia-United States alliance
becomes of even greater importance
than it has been in the past.
Holt won the last general elections—
and a record majority by posing to
the electorate the simple question: “Do
you want the Australia-United States
alliance maintained?”
When the British announcement was
made he lost an invaluable opportunity
to crystallise the issues for the next
election.
He could easily have pointed out
what was politically fundamental in
the British decision that the
Australia-United States alliance had
become even more important to Aus-
tralia now than the majority of Aus-
tralian voters felt it to be at the last
elections.
Quite easily and legitimately
he could have moved on to the next
proposition. This proposition was that,
for those who shared his view that the
Australia-United States alliance was
vital to Australia (seemingly the
majority of Australian voters), it was
essential that the political grouping of
power in Australia should be the one
dedicated (as he and his Government
are) to the maintenance of the alliance.
I say he could have done this legiti-
mately because, despite Whitlam’s ef-
forts to secure a change in both ALP
organisation and South-East Asian
policies, there is still a large, influential
and effective section of the Labor Party
which I think I can describe, quite
fairly, as doubting the value of the Aus-
tralia-United States alliance, or as being
actively opposed to it.
Whitlam may be able to get the
changes he wants in ALP foreign policy
before the next elections two years
hence, but he has the job in front of
him. Holt could have dealt with this
obvious fundamental. Instead he pre-
ferred to express “regret” at the British
decision, “disappointment” over the
extent of the British cuts, and to draw
comfort from the nebulous hint that
Britain might be in South-East Asia
after 1975. t
To this extent he justified Whitlam s
assertion that the Government had been
caught unawares. On its performance
so far, it might not have been, caught
unawares, but it certainly got itself into
the unhealthy frame of mind where it
was too busy deploring the past to show
publicly that it was looking realistic-
ally toward the future.


AUSTRALIA
The British pull-out—not
even good rhetoric
THE WEEK WAS ONE of bitterly
cold nights followed by windless, balmy
days in Canberra. Heavy night frosts
were rapidly devoured by the day’s
sun. Early Wednesday the British White
Paper on the East of Suez withdrawal
was published, and a most innocuous
handout issued in the Prime Minister’s
name, containing such bureaucratic pro-
nouncements as “the British announce-
ment carries implications which
obviously must form part of the con-
tinuing review we make of defence
policy and planning.” There was no
attempt to spell out what these impli-
cations might be. With admissions by
an author that the statement “some-
what lacked oomph,” there was a Press
conference summoned at 9.15 a.m. and
the Prime Minister developed on his
statement somewhat.
He was very concerned to put the
best possible interpretation on the out-
come, saying that it gave us “a very
considerable period of years” in which
to adjust, forgetting that the adjust-
ment may be even more time-
consuming if proceeded with in a
leisurely and formal way.
To be truthful, Mr. Holt did issue
a sort of rallying call, saying the British
withdrawal should' indicate to Aus-
tralians “the fact that we don’t live in
some sort of lotus land, and that we
Defence Minister Fairhall... $1100
million
are placed by geography in an area of
danger.” But in emphasising the need
for individuals to “put their best efforts
forward” he neatly avoided committing
the Government to any hard policies
to fill the defence gap. Picking up a
point made by the Chamber of Manu-
factures in the industry submissions to
Cabinet the week before, he illustrated
his call for harder work by saying that
the easy-going 40-hour week, 45-week
year could not be afforded if we as a
nation were to provide adequately for
both defence and development. But, of
course, he hadn’t meant to propose, he
quickly backtracked, that hours of
work should be increased.
And, as if to hand ammunition to
those who would say his early-morning
rally-call was mere rhetoric (and not
good rhetoric at that), he and other
members of his Government proceeded
to reassure everyone that the response
to the British announcement would only
come after “considerable study and
inter-governmental consultation.”
As the balmy day unfolded, the
Cabinet went back to its laborious
deliberations on the Budget submissions
of the defence services. The talk was
that Defence Minister Fairhall had
quite ruthlessly pruned back the Ser-
vices submissions even before they
reached Cabinet, where they added up
to not much more than $llOO million
(compared with $950 million spent this
year). Cabinet Ministers said urbanely
that they were not being influenced in
their treatment of this submission one
bit by the British announcement. They
said that any response would have to
wait on lengthy reviews and consulta-
tions.
Impatient people retorted that as
long as we think merely in terms of
our present eight-battalion Army
(which allows a maximum of four
battalions in the field) there is simply
no military capacity for us to make
any effective response to the changed
strategic situation. If rally-call
were to be more than rhetoric then it
would have to be followed quickly
by some tangible sign of a govern-
mental determination to prepare the
nation to play a greater role in South-
East Asia. Reporters asked whether
an increased call-up were likely, more
generous economic aid, or what? Oh,
Treasurer McMahon ... cutback
no, came the answers: it is too early
to be concerned with such matters.
And from the Cabinet rooms came
the story that Mr. McMahon and
his Treasury advisers were winning in
their battle to cut back the defence
vote further, by arguing for defer-
ments and rescheduling. Purchase of
new equipment (like the Sheridan
light tank) are to be held up pending
yet more exhaustive reviews and test-
ing. The troops in Vietnam will for
a lot longer bot off the Americans
for helicopters, for example.
Economic aid is the expenditure
item about which Treasury officials
get quite red-faced and emotional. They
put in a strong Budget submission
urging that aid be cut, illustrating their
argument with a little graph showing
the aid bill of the U.S., Germany, and
Britain sloping downwards since 1961.
Despite this, Cabinet approved the
Indian request for emergency food aid
of 150,000 tons (worth ssm.), the argu-
ment being that we are anyway com-
mitted under the Kennedy Round
cereals arrangement to contributing
225,000 tons overall, and we might as
well give the bulk to the Indians, whose
need is the greatest.
The team which went to Malaysia
and Singapore to report on their re-
quests for continued defence assis-
tance has returned and recommended
a s2lm. three-year program (almost
the same as the program just ending),
but a decision on this is likely to be
delayed now.
Mr. Holt did begin very tentatively
to speculate in specific terms about
the appropriate response to the British
withdrawal. Of the possible regional
response he said: “ASPAC has not so
far a military aspect, but who knows


how it might develop over the years.”
This suggestion was quickly discounted
as a serious proposal on the grounds
that it would tend to alienate the
Japanese and deter the Indonesians
from joining. Prime Ministerial im-
plications that the U-S. should be in-
volved in Malaysia-Singapore-Australia-
New Zealand-Britain defence talks was
also squashed hurriedly, after it was
realised this would be anathema to
Singapore.
About the only constructive proposal
immediately being floated among
officials was that the Commonwealth
Strategic Reserve land forces should be
maintained by substituting Malaysian
and Singaporean troops for the depart-
ing British, and for Australia to bear
the cost of maintaining a pared-down
British logistics establishment.
As the day warmed up the only
malice was for the British, and their
sharp volte face. A three-page colla-
tion, “British statement about the re-
tention of forces in South-East Asia,”
was conveniently available. It vividly
pointed up the complete reversal of
British policy and the complete nega-
tion of unambiguous undertakings. For
instance, as late as April 27 this year,
UK Defence Minister Healey had
spoken of “maintaining commitments,”
yet the final White Paper could switch
to talk of “honoring obligations” while
intending “to change our Far East com-
mitments.”
This, at least, was backing for Mr.
Holt’s claim that the British withdrawal
had been determined only quite re-
cently. But it did not answer two criti-
cisms being raised against the Prime
Minister: first that Australia had done
little to strengthen the political forces
in Britain arguing for the retention of a
military presence by offering to take
up some of the burden; second, that,
thinking wishfully, Mr. Holt has simply
not read the writing on the wall and
had unnecessarily delayed any Aus-
tralian response.
In the cold of the morning, Mr. Holt
also talked of our Vietnam commit-
ments. There hadn’t been any specific
request arising out of Mr. McNamara’s
visit to Vietnam, he said, but “we
recognise, of course, that whatever any
of the Allied countries are able to con-
tribute is welcomed by the Government
of South Vietnam, and we do from time
to time review the size and nature of
our commitments.”
There is some discussion of minor
additions to the Vietnam force going
on in departments in Canberra. Talk of
sending some of the Centurion tanks,
for instance. Another battalion could
be found to make the force up to full
brigade strength, but it would stretch
our tiny army very heavily indeed.
Mr. Holt said he would prefer- dis-
cussion of any major increase in force
levels to be deferred until September
or October when there would be tenta-
tive plans for a meeting in Bangkok
or Seoul of the Vietnam allies.
Around noon, however, things hotted
up for Mr. Holt when a message came
through from President Johnson that he
was sending General Maxwell Taylor
that weekend. The “close and intimate
working relations” with the U.S., of
which Mr. Holt has so often spoken,
seemed to have gone awry.
Australian officials admit that there
will be a strong moral pressure brought
on us to increase our commitments in
Vietnam. General Taylor is sure to have
done some simple arithmetic which
shows how light our Vietnam burden
is, compared with America’s: 2500 U.S.
troops per million of population to our
550, and an annual American expendi-
ture of $l5O per capita to our $3 per
capita.
The Press
On the pull-out
Prime Minister Holt ... lotus land
“WAKE UP AUSTRALIA" and
“AUSTRALIA IN DANGER" and
“HOLT: WAKE TO OUR PERIL”
the afternoon newspaper headlines read
last week, w ith varied editorial reactions
to the Prime Minister's "lotus land”
statement; the most trenchant, the
Sydney "Sun’s” comment, “This is a
platitude, the time for platitudes is
past.”
. On the same day Sydney’s morning
“Daily Telegraph,” faster off the mark
than its competitors, had set what was
to be their line of response, saying,
“Australia will have to shoulder an in-
creasingly heavier burden of defence
each year, with all this means in terms
of economic sacrifice. The future calls
for courage, hard work, and self-
reliance.”
Next morning, after time for con-
sideration, Australia’s other daily
newspapers were able to look at the
British White Paper and Mr. Holt’s
comment as soberly. “The Sydney
Morning Herald,” Melbourne’s “Age,”
and “The Australian” had mild shots
at Mr. Holt’s reactions.
“Ambiguous rhetoric is the last thing
Australians need or expect from their
Government at this stage,” said the
“Age.” The “SMH” began with: “Mr.
Holt very properly has made no attempt
to minimise the serious consequences
for Australia . . . something of a jolt
has been administered to the mental
attitude of the Government . . . Mr.
Holt’s remarks leave it very much open
to question whether the Government
has yet appreciated that Britain’s de-
cision . . . ends an era in Australian
foreign policy.”
“The Australian.” in the course of a
“Let’s get a move on; Australia must
find her own destiny—and she will have
no better ally than boldness” editorial,
said, “Mr. Holt's Government has first
to convince the nation . . . the sternest
test will be to cut away the flabbiness
and indolence . . . can we afford to
see basic development languish in favor
of glossy skyscrapers?” The “Canberra
Times” said that “Government action
and example are more likely to achieve
the desired ends than occasional ex-
hortations.”
The “Age” and the “Advertiser” in
Adelaide both minimised dependence
on Britain’s promise to rush troops East
of Suez in an emergency, only because
they would not be acclimatised and
might not have jungle fighting experi-
ence.
Most of the papers were philosophical
about Britain’s planned time-table with-
drawal. “Australia could not have hoped
for better at this watershed of history,’
said the Launceston “Examiner,” pro-
ceeding to quote the Churchill analogy
of the withdrawal of the Roman legions
and the good they left behind. The
“West Australian” looked back a shorter
distance to: “Had Australia assessed the
position realistically 18 months ago, it
might have been possible to influence
the turn of events more in our favor.
Canberra took the attitude, with others,
that Britain must be pressed to keep
going as before.”
“Wanted: more people,” the “Can-
berra Times” saw the main issue, with
an exhortation to the Government to
improve a “middling” migration pro-
gram in many ways. Others agreed with
“The Australian’s” idea of “Let’s get a
move on,” while differing as to how.
“The Sydney Morning Herald’ saw
a new independence for Australia:
“Unlike Britain, we cannot withdraw
from South-East Asia when it becomes
inconvenient to remain there. Britain,
perhaps, has been no bad guide foi
us in the past: but we must find out
our own signposts for the future.
Many Australians began making this
point in 1941.

Trade, customs
Rug-pulling
John McEwen ... having a go
IT WAS A WEEK in which old wmys
seemed to be falling about Australia’s
ears. While Cabinet Ministers were con-
sidering the British plans for their pull
out from Singapore and Malaysia and
the American hints for a greater com-
mitment in Vietnam, Mr. McEwen also
had a go at Britain and America on
the trade front.
Of the Americans, he said that they
had show'n bad faith in negotiations on
the wool duty in asking that Aus-
tralia reserve only half its tobacco
market for local producers and reduce
the tobacco tariff by 50 percent they
had made “an incredible request.” Of
the British, quoting Prime Minister
Wilson’s statement last November that
British entry would be dependent on
safeguarding “essential Commonwealth
interests,” he said that the British were,
in fact, giving us “scant consideration.”
But a Department of Trade man,
under a non-de-plume, tried to pull the
rug from under Mr. McEwen’s feet
when he wrote in a letter to the “Can-
berra Times”: “Could it be that it was
Australia which pressed exorbitant de-
mands in the U.S. negotiations, or failed
to respond to U.S. proposals wuth
reasonable concessions? If so, it would
not be difficult to foretell the break-
down of negotiations. The real losers
are primary producers, in particular,
and the Australian economy in general.
“As for the wdeked British Govern-
ment in its negotiations to enter the
EEC, it would be interesting to hear
from the Minister wdiat specific con-
siderations the British Government
should insist on to protect Australian
trade.”
To round the week out, Mr. Oala
Oala-Rarua, the New Guinea political
and union leader, announced that in-
dependence for New Guinea could be
as close as 1970 and that long delays in
political change could lead to uprisings.
Industrial front
Transport strikes
UNION MILITANCY caused strikes
by petrol tanker drivers throughout
Australia last week (disrupting much of
industry, costing thousands of other
unionists up to a week’s work, and the
public tremendous inconvenience), over
the wages of contract drivers compared
with oil company drivers; and by rail-
waymen in Queensland over the effects
of dieselisation throughout that State.
In Victoria, the Tramways’ Union
threatened a 24-hour stoppage of
Government trams and buses last Fri-
day but postponed it for further talks
on the log of claims.
When a general swdtch to diesel
locomotives in Queensland was
announced a year or so ago, the Com-
bined Railways’ Unions foresaw possible
conflict but waited until the first effects
had been felt -- redundancy, down-
gradings, and transfers involving
loss to members (selling homes, etc.).
The union complained to the Railways
Commissioner, and put their case to
Premier Nicklin in January. Further
meetings failed to settle the main issues,
and finally the CRU decided to hold
24-hour stoppages in each of the State’s
four divisions.
Railwaymen at Mount Morgan
jumped the gun by walking out for
36 hours on July 16, followed by Rock-
hampton men last w’eek, despite a re-
straining order. They went back next
day w'ith firm calls to the other three
divisions to hold their stoppages. Some
passengers on through journeys spent
up to 100 hours in trains.
The CRU’s main request to the
Government has been for downgraded
men to retain their pay classification,
and for transferred men to be paid a
“disturbance” allowance. “For six
months only” has been the Govern-
ment’s response to the first, while on
the second it has offered free rail trans-
port for dismantled homes, but no costs.
The CRU hon. secretary, Mr. Prideaux,
says the change to diesels did not affect
pay classifications in southern States,
why should it in Queensland?
In Victoria, a combination of
attitudes and circumstances looks
like leading inevitably to serious tram
and bus strikes unless the Arbitration
Premier Nicklin... rail stoppages

Commissioner, the Tramways Board,
and the State Government are more
than usually generous.
Last week’s strike threat followed
the rejection of a log of claims asking
for a $6.70 basic-wage increase and a
$5.90 margins rise; workers’ compensa-
tion equal to wages; five weeks’ annual
leave for shift workers, four for day
workers; four weeks’ cumulative sick
pay a year; and long-service leave pro
rata for employees leaving for health
or compassionate reasons after three
years.
The Commissioner’s rejection has led
the union to threaten direct action,
saying that Tramways workers are
poorly paid on basic rates and make
up some of their needs in shift work
and overtime; their job is arduous and
nerve-racking. Against this, the job
demands little skill or training, so their
bargaining position is poor. And Tram-
ways Boards run at a loss.
Much of this works strongly in favor
of the Peking-line Communist leader-
ship of their union. Its secretary,
Clarrie O’Shea, is closely associated
with Ted Hill, leader of one of the
two Communist parties, and Hill’s aims
include cultivating the strike weapon,
and fracturing the ACTU and the
Trades and Labor Councils in the lotus
land.
Warm winter
Few pools
DURING A WINTER remarkable
(wuth odd exceptions) for its sunshine
and warmth, supposedly hardy,
outdoors-oriented Australians from Bris-
bane around the coast to Adelaide have
had virtually no public pools to swim
in. This continues to puzzle migrants,
and mystifies some Australians as well.
Perth is the only lucky city in this
respect. Two Olympic-sized heated
City Council pools remain open from
8 a.m. to 8 p.m. through winter. Adel-
aide has one heated pool only, the 25-
yard Unley Crystal Pool; the city’s
eight others are closed from early April.
Melbourne has one heated pool, Can-
berra called for tenders to heat its
Olympic pool last month, but the NDC
cancelled the call as “premature.”
Sydney’s City Council plans to have
heating in its new' Sydney Domain pool,
but currently the only heated public-
owned pool is, again, a 25-metre at
Cabramatta, a western suburb. All
others are closed, although gentry
knowm as “icebergs” use sea baths such
as Bondi’s.
But the shame of it all for “hardy”
Australians is centred 'in Brisbane,
whose people join the tourists surfing
on coastal beaches whenever the tem-
perature is above 70 degrees, but
mothball their swimsuits when it slips
below' that; although Europeans and
Melbourne citizens might think the
weather summery.
Brisbane’s 13 pools close on April 30
and don’t reopen until September 1.
Its Chief Health Officer said last week
that its best-known, Centenary Pool,
had tried opening in both May and
August, but found it did not pay. How-
ever the City Council plans to heat the
popular Valley Baths, making that a
condition of the next five-year lease.
Presumably it would, like the Perth
pools, be heated to a 72-82 degree
range, the minimum required to coax
an average Australian into the w'ater in
wdnter.
This thought may take sw'imming fol-
lowers’ minds back to Adelaide, where,
last February, Kathy Wainw'right broke
the w'orld 1650-yard record in an
Olympic pool where the waves were
almost big enough to break, and the
judges and timekeepers wore sou’-
w'esters against the pouring rain.
The fiasco of those National Swim-
ming Championships stirred the S.A.
Government to promise one-third of the
$370,000 needed to build a new
Olympic pool at North Parklands by
late 1969; unheated, of course.
Last week, after the Adelaide City
Council had reported failure to raise the
other tw'o-thirds from surrounding coun-
cils, Premier Dunstan lifted the Gov-
ernment's promise to “up to $200.000."


COMMENT
Get off the lotus, Mr. Holt!
IT WAS A REALISTIC imperative that made
John Curtin say on December 27, 1941: “Without
any inhibitions of any kind, I make it quite clear
that Australia looks to America, free of any pangs as
to our traditional links or kinship with the United
Kingdom.” However, when Mr. Holt suggests in July,
1967, that the United States might later move in
and replace Britain in co-operation with Malaysia,
Singapore, Australia, and New Zealand, he seems to
be displaying the symptoms of an addict of one of
our favorite species of lotus seeds, the one that pro-
duces the dream that there is always a Big Brother
who will come at anything.
There is no sign that the Americans wish to
enter into further special commitment in South-East
Asia, and there is every sign that neither Singapore
nor Malaysia wants them to. Nor should we imagine
that the fact that Britain has now formally announced
its departure means that anybody in particular has
to preserve the particular role Britain played. No
iron law of history demands that allied foreign troops
be disposed forever in Singapore and Malaysia.
As requested, Australia should be prepared to
make temporary arrangements of a special kind with
these two nations provided there is some limiting
definition of our role. But the final end of present
policy should be a regional pact between the nations
of Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines,
Australia, and New Zealand, a pact based on mutual
security but also with other neighborly dealings
and certainly with the assumption that nations which
may differ from each other in some ways can never-
theless co-operate in other ways.
Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines are
formally allied with the United States. This need
not stop us from allying ourselves with nations that
are not so allied. But to insist on the United States
coming in on everything we do is to limit our activity.
There are nations that do not want formal alliance
with the United States, but these nations can never-
theless be Australia’s friends.
In looking by instinct to the United States to
fill the gap left by Britain’s departing, Mr. Holt
seemed to forget that Australian policy has been more
independent of both Britain and the United States
than his critics allow for. Australia supported Malaysia
and Singapore during the Sukarno confrontation
but for our own reasons, not merely as a British
vassal, and with an insistence on preserving some
kind of friendly relations with Indonesia. Australia
supports American policy in South Vietnam but
this does not stop us from enjoying particularly
friendly relations with Cambodia.
Compared with the nations of South-East Asia,
Australia is uniquely rich in variety of natural re-
sources, in industrialisation, in volume of trade, and
in general prosperity. For Australians to describe
themselves as a “developing society” is quite dishonest.
We are in the sense in which that word is normally
used as developed a society as you can find. We
should now find ways of offsetting our comparative
numerical smallness by our general prosperity so that
we can act with some strength in the area where we
live and make ourselves an ally worth having.
This is not just a matter of military strength.
But to increase our military strength would make
a good start. To do this we must revolutionise our
way of going about such matters. We must destroy
our present top-heavy administrative structure,
destroy the traditional departmentalisations, and look
for new ways, Australian ways, of getting more for
the money we are spending on our military forces.
This is where Mr. Holt is so deplorably wrong
when he whinged about Australia being a “lotus
land,” with a 40-hour week mentality, and so forth.
The ordinary people of Australia are skilled and highly
adaptable, perhaps more ready to accept change
than even the peoples of most other industrialised
societies. The real lotus-eaters of Australia are not
the ordinary people, but their leaders, who don’t
yet seem to be able to respond to new challenges.
Let Mr. Holt and his colleagues first provide some
new sense of leadership to the people of Australia
before they criticise them as lotus-eaters.
For years now, and not only in politics, there
has been a crisis in leadership in Australia, a slow-
ness in reaching out toward new potentials, a
preference for the past, or even a mere vacuity, lost
in space, concerned neither with past, present, nor
future. Things have just drifted along to a mur-
muring background of self-congratulation. Perhaps
only sharp, external shocks will bring us new leaders,
or wake up the present ones from their dreams.


Whose
Jerusalem?
"Pray for the peace of Jerusalem " the
Jews sing. "Peace be within thy walls"
Their prayer remains unanswered
THERE ARE EIGHT GATES that
lead into the ancient city of Jerusalem.
Until last month, half of them were
closed. One of them the one called
Beautiful or Golden Gate was
walled up in the sixteenth century by
the Sultan, Suleiman the Magnificent, to
make sure that the Messiah would never
come through, as legend said he would,
and disrupt the orderly government of
the city. Three others the Zion
Gate, the Jaffa Gate, the New Gate
• were shut by Jordan in 1948 to keep
the Israelis out of the city. “Our feet
shall stand within thy gates, O Jeru-
salem,” the Jews sing. “Pray for the
peace of Jerusalem . . . Peace be
within thy walls . . .” Their prayer
remains unanswered. There is still no
peace in Jerusalem. But the prediction
has come true, for once more Jews
can walk in the streets of their ancient
capital.
For the past 19 years, no Jew had
been allowed within the walls of the
Old City, which remained under Arab
control. After a fierce siege and battle
during the first Arab-Jewish war of
1948, the Jews had fled from the
quarter of the Old City that had
traditionally been theirs. It has stood
almost empty ever since, a bombed-out
ruin, its synagogues and buildings a
heap of rubble. On Jordanian maps of
Jerusalem the area is referred to as
“ex-Jewish quarter.” The buildings left
standing in the quarter are inhabited
by Arab refugees from the area which
those same maps call “Jewish-occupied
Palestine.” The armistice agreement
between the Jews and Arabs had called
for free access to all the holy places. In
practice this meant that Christian Arabs
from Israel were allowed to visit their
shrines in the city at Christmas and
Eastertime. But Jews from Israel
or anywhere else were never allowed
entry.
One half of Jerusalem was available
to the Jews, but it was somewhat un-
authentic, having originated in modern
times as a suburb outside the walls.
From the time the city became divided
in 1948, the Israelis developed a pas-
sion for looking into the Old City.
The border between Israel and Jordan
was about half a mile from the site of
the ancient Temple, which pious Jews
are supposed to visit on a pilgrimage
three times a year at the springtime
festivals of Passover and Shavuoth and
the autumn festival of Succoth. As
these holidays approach, the Israeli
trains are filled with pilgrims following
the biblical injunction to go up to
Jerusalem. Fervent young men ride the
cars on the narrow line that winds up
to the city through the Judean hills.
They carry prayer shawls and prayer
books and urge their fellow passengers,
religious or not, to put on the shawls
and recite the psalms that were sung
2000 years ago by Jewish pilgrims
marching along the highway to Jeru-
salem to sacrifice at the Temple.
When they reached the modern city,
Jewish pilgrims climbed Mount Zion,
the one section of the ancient city that
remained in Israeli hands. They
ascended the roofs of the buildings on
the Mount and tried to look over the
walls to catch sight of the Wailing
Wall, the one portion of the ancient
Temple that survived destruction by
the Romans in A.D. 70. It was not only
the pious who tried to look into the
Old City. All Israelis seem eager to do
it. The guidebooks to Israeli Jerusalem
list place after place from which a
good view can be obtained.
Even foreign tourists in Israel, who
knew they were going over to the other
side, always got caught up in the
excitement and took part in the game,
peering into the future, spotting this
tower and that dome and that hill with
all the fervor of a religious fanatic try-
ing to envision the outlines of the
heavenly Jerusalem. Elsewhere in
Israel and throughout the world, Jews
at Passover promise themselves that
they will spend the following Passover
in the Holy City. “Next year in Jeru-
salem” are the final words of the Pass-
over service. In Jerusalem itself, Jews
say, “Next year in the heavenly Jeru-
salem” and then try to catch a glimpse
of the worldly Old City. Even in their
"It is still a cult
centre as it
was in antiquity"
homeland, the Jews have still in a sense
been on the outside looking in.
But that is not unusual. For no one
is really at home in Jerusalem. Much
of the population of the Old City
consists of Arab refugees. The vast
majority of the Jews of the New City,
like most Israelis, are immigrants. The
Moslems survive there economically,
and have for centuries, only because
Jerusalem is a Christian shrine. The
chief business of the Old City is
Christianity. Except during the British
Mandate and the brief lifetime of the
medieval Crusader Kingdom of Jeru-
salem, Christians lived in and visited
the city only on the sufferance of the
Moslem authorities. The Catholics
share corners here and there in some
holy places controlled by the Orthodox
Church; in other shrines, they play re-
luctant host to schismatic Maronite
priests. Members of the Coptic Church
have a precarious little shrine on the
roof of the Church of the Holy
Sepulchre, which officially belongs to
the Orthodox and the Catholics; but
these sects, in turn, have to entrust
the key to the church to a Moslem.
On the Jewish side of the city,
the pious try their hardest, even to
the extent of throwing stones (stoning
is a punishment that comes naturally
in that rocky land) at the secular Jews
to make them feel unwelcome, and
many secular Jews remind their ultra-
orthodox brothers, a minority in the
city, that here once again they dwell,
self-segregated, in a ghetto in a city of
unbelievers. It is only the pilgrims who
seem to feel at home. For Jerusalem,
despite the religious scepticisms of
many of its inhabitants, is still a temple
city, a cult centre as it was in
antiquity.
Moslems consider the city holy be-
cause it was from Jerusalem that
Mohammed is supposed to have
ascended to heaven one evening, on a
Jordan barred Israelis 19 years ago.
Now they are back in the sacred places


winged hdrse, to converse with the
heavenly hosts. The mark of his horse’s
hoof is still pointed out on the great
rock that stands at the centre of the
Dome of the Rock, Jerusalem’s most
beautiful building and one of Islam’s
most sacred shrines. The rock’s sanctity
long antedated Mohammed’s heavenly
journey, however. Pious Jews believe
that it marks the spot where Abraham,
obeying God’s command, started to
offer up his son, Isaac, as a sacrifice.
The rock stood beneath the altar of
Solomon’s Temple, and on it the
Hebrew priest slaughtered sacrificial
lambs and poured out wine before God
twice each day, morning and evening,
for almost 1000 years.
Christians revere the city as the site
of the Crucifixion and Resurrection.
Jerusalem contains dozens of Christian
shrines, the Virgin Mary’s birthplace,
the Garden of Gethsemane, the site of
Jesus’ scourging and His trial, and the
route He followed on His way to
Golgotha.
Except for a few years during the
Crusades, Moslems have always enjoyed
the freedom to visit their shrines in
Jerusalem. For Moslems have been in
control of the city for most of the time
since the Arabs first conquered Jerusa-
lem in A.D. 637. Christians have had a
less easy time making pilgrimages .to
their shrines. The Crusades were
initiated in part because fanatical
Moslems in the eleventh century for-
bade the presence of Christians in the
Holy City. After the Crusades ended
with the Moslem reconquest of Jerusa-
lem, Christian pilgrims were permitted
to visit the city. But the journals of the
pilgrims who came are filled with tales
of harassment and discomfort. Some of
their discomfort was the normal suffer-
ing of tourists in any age and any
"Half a mile closer
to heaven than
London or Rome"
place. But most of it came from the
fact that the city’s proprietors viewed
Jerusalem as a great economic asset
and did their best to exploit the pilgrim
traffic, extorting every penny they
could from pious visitors to the shrines.
It was not until the end of the last
century that Christians were permitted
to visit the shrines without bribing the
authorities.
Over the centuries during which the
city was under Moslem control, the
Jews, like the Christians, managed to
retain their connection with it. Jews
had first come to Jerusalem around
1000 8.C., when King David conquered
the city and made it his capital. It
remained the Jewish capital for more
than a thousand years. At various times
over that millennium, the Jewish nation
was conquered by Egyptians, Assyrians,
Babylonians, Persians, Syrians, Greeks,
and Romans; but Jerusalem and its
Temple destroyed and rebuilt several
times remained the centre of the
Jewish life. In the year A.D. 132, how-
ever, after a series of bloody and un-
successful rebellions by the Jews against
their Roman overlords, the Emperor
Hadrian issued an order turning Jerusa-
lem into a Roman city.
As a result of his edict, a temple,
dedicated to Jupiter, was constructed
on the site of the Jewish Temple, which
had recently been destroyed during
one of the rebellions. The figure of
a swine an animal abhorrent to Jews
was carved over the main gate of the
town to remind the Jews that the city
no longer belonged to them. The name
of the province Jerusalem was changed
from Judea, a Jewish name, to Pales-
tina, a name recalling the Jews’ ancient
enemies, the Philistines. Jerusalem itself
was given the Roman name Aelia
Capitolina. And no Jew was allowed
to enter the new city; any Jew caught
within its walls was crucified.
Despite the Roman law against them,
Jews eventually managed to return to
Jerusalem. For a fee, they were finally
permitted to pray at the Wailing Wall,
mourning the Temple’s destruction and
the defeat of their nation. Jews even
worked their way back to the city as
residents. The Jewish community re-
mained vigorous in Jerusalem and the
rest of Palestine. In the sixth century
there was even, oddly enough, a tiny
autonomous Jewish republic on the
island of Tiran in the Gulf of Aqaba,
opposite Sharm el Sheikh, where the
Egyptian establishment of a blockade
last month led to the Middle Eastern
crisis. In 614, when the Persians con-
quered the country, they re-established
a Hebrew republic with its centre at
Jerusalem.
The Jews had welcomed the Per-
sians as deliverers, and in return for
their help they received control of
Jerusalem. They celebrated the restor-
ation of the city by re-establishing ser-
vices at the site of the Temple, sacrific-
ing animals once again according to
the prescribed ritual after a lapse of
500 years. But the Persians
quickly realised that the Jews were
by now a minority in Palestine. If
the country was going to be held, the
Christian inhabitants had to be placated;
and in 617 they went back on their
agreement, put an end to the Jewish
Arabs still worship at the Dome of the Rock, a shrine equally
sanctified in the Islam and Hebrew faiths
A chaplain offers prayers in the Old City,
under entirely Jewish rule again after 2000 years


government of Jerusalem, and forbade
Jews to live in the city and within
three miles of its walls.
The Christians soon recaptured
Jerusalem and drove the Persians out,
but they did not hold it for long. For
a few years later, in 637, Mohammed’s
friend and follower, the conquering
Arab Caliph Omar, rode his camel up
to the gates of Jerusalem and demanded
that the city surrender. The Christian
inhabitants capitulated to him, but
asked for guarantees that he would pro-
tect their holy places and allow no
Jews to live in the city. Omar agreed
to their demand.
Despite his promise, Jews were
eventually allowed to resettle in
Jerusalem. In the Holy City, as else-
where in the Moslem domains through-
out the Middle Ages, Jews enjoyed
relative toleration. Pious Jews came to
Jerusalem to die. A group of ascetics
lived there, praying night and day for
the restoration of the Temple and the
coming of the Messiah. The city
attracted Jewish scholars from Western
Europe as well as from all over the
Arab world.
For centuries, in the Middle Ages
and thereafter, Messianic movements
arose among the Jews of Europe and
Asia. Periodically, excited crowds would
gather to prepare for a return to the
Holy City. At the time of the Crusades,
Jews of Persia and Iraq planned to
march toward Palestine to conquer the
land for themselves just as the Christian
Crusaders had done. In the year 1147,
the Jews of Bagdad gave all their pos-
sessions to charity and stood on the
rooftops of their houses, waiting for
angels to come and carry them away
to Jerusalem. In the sixteenth and again
in the seventeenth century, Jewish
leaders attempted to arrange a return
of their people to the Holy Land. Their
efforts were always frustrated, but
Jerusalem continued to attract the more
pious among them. They dwelt in their
own quarter in the south-west corner
of the city and maintained a burial
ground outside the city walls on the
western slope of the Mount of Olives.
There thousands of crumbling grave-
stones, inscribed with Hebrew letters,
still testify to the Jewish belief that it
is in Jerusalem that the Angel Gabriel
will announce the resurrection of all
the dead. Those fortunate souls who
have had the foresight to be buried
in the city will be the first to rise.
It was not the Messiah or the angels
but Zionist yearnings that finally
brought the Jews back to Jerusalem.
In the nineteenth century, they estab-
lished their first suburb outside the city
walls. Eventually the suburb grew, ex-
tending westward for miles over the
rocky, treeless Judean Hills. As the
Jewish city grew westward, it turned
away from the frowning, inscrutable
walls of the Old City. Today it looks
like a Western town, complete with
mini-skirts and modern architecture.
Its citizens attend pop-art exhibitions.
Its newspapers carry advertisements
for such Western phenomena as life-
insurance policies and weight-watchers’
clubs. Western influence is so pro-
found that in one hotel menu the old
Jewish standby, gefilte fish, is described
as “carpe farcie a la juive.”
But despite the Western orientation
of the Jewish section of the city, it
is always evident that this is Jerusalem,
the holy. The city “set among the hills,”
as one psalm says, is half a mile closer
to heaven than Rome or London is.
Many of the streets bear biblical names
—Samuel the Prophet, King Solomon,
Ezekiel, Amos. On the buses, signs in
Hebrew proclaim, “Thou shalt not
smoke.” And the orthodox men with
side curls and long black coats,
women bewigged and desperately un-
fashionable are everywhere in evi-
dence. If access to the Old City is
retained, the aura of sanctity is apt to
become even more pervasive. But it will
be tempered somewhat at least from
an orthodox Jewish point of view
by the fact that the undivided city will
have a sizable number of Christian
and Moslem inhabitants; for their sake,
the city ordinance against running
buses on Saturday, the Jewish Sab-
bath, would have to be relaxed.
If Israel does retain control of all of
Jerusalem it will be the Old City that
sees most of the changes, however. Jews
are already reoccupying their syna-
gogues and houses in the south-west
quarter. One hotel called the Aelia
Capitolina to remind the Arabs of that
glorious time when no Jews were
allowed in the city will have its
name changed. Pictures of Hussein and
Nasser have come down from the walls
of the Arab shops. The schoolroom
maps that show the Arab empire at its
height in the centuries before the Chris-
tians took back Spain and the Jews
took back Jewish-occupied Palestine
have been put away in closets. The
market stalls no longer have bins full
of Nescafe, chewing gum, and canned
meats; American aid to Jordan pro-
vided the Arabs with these luxuries,
which the Israelis could never afford to
import in such quantities. Nejit little
"On the buses ,
signs proclaim 'Thou
shalt not smoke"'
blue signs will appear all over the city
to mark sites of historic or religious
interest. Israeli policemen control, far
more effectively than the Arabs ever
did, the horrendous traffic jam that
develops every Friday on the Via Dolo-
rosa, when the pilgrims follow the route
of the stations of the Cross. And, of
course, the tourist and pilgrim money
will all be going to Israel instead of
Jordan.
But many things will remain the
same. The pilgrims with their cameras
and souvenir Arab headdresses will
hardly change. The souvenir shops
the IX Station of the Cross Bazaar,
the St. Anne Souvenir Shop, the aptly
named Veronica Photography Shop
will continue to sell fake antiquities,
imitation crowns of thorns, Jordan
River water, rosaries made from olive
pits gathered on the Mount of Olives,
icons of Christ (although these items
will probably be moved closer together
on the shelves to make room for orlon
yarmulkes and plastic menorahs). No
doubt sacks of American wheat flour
will still be handed out to the city’s
poor in a yard beside St. Stephen’s
Gate, although the poor will no longer
be called Arab refugees. The markets
will still be crowded with gnarled and
ancient porters bearing enormous bur-
dens on their backs, and village women,
in beautifully embroidered gowns,
squatting in the dust all day to sell a
basketful of tomatoes or a dozen eggs.
David Ben-Gurion has recently sug-
gested that the Israelis tear down the
16th-century walls that surround the
Old City, joining the two halves of
Jerusalem Arab and Jewish into
one unified city. His enthusiasm is cer-
tainly misplaced the Old City of
Jerusalem is one of the best-preserved
medieval walled towns remaining to us.
But the Holy City should be a place
where Jew and Arab can mix. By its
very nature, Jerusalem is a border city.
It is the last outpost before the desert
begins. As you come up to it from the
coast, through the rocky Judean Hills,
the landscape becomes more and more
barren, the hills stonier, higher, and
emptier. But there are occasional brooks,
occasional fertile terraces and olive
groves. At Jerusalem and the Mount of
Olives, the connection with the fertile
coast is broken. East of the Mount of
Olives there is another geography, a
barren wilderness, a stony lunar land-
scape that slopes sharply down to the
salty shores of the Dead Sea.
Jerusalem can only be understood if
it is approached and approachable
—■ from both the east and the west,
from the Arab desert and the Israeli
coast. The city has always served as a
link between the coast and the desert.
Its history has linked Jew to Christian,
Christian to Moslem, and, as most of
its inhabitants would point out, earth
to heaven. It is the link to heaven,
unfortunately, that has caused most of
the city’s troubles.

KHRUSHCHEV
TALKS
The long interview in which Khrushchev talked about himself
and some of the men he had known —and gave his own
gloss to events has now been televised in Australia, on TCN
and GTV. It will later form a program in the Project '67 series
Khrushchev and his wife in their dacha outside Moscow... looking back on history
Kennedy would never have allowed the U.S. to get into such a sticky situation
Mao Tse Tung urged him to provoke the Americans into military action
I WAS BORN in a small izba, a
wooden house, in the little, town of
Kalinovka, which is near to the
Ukrainian-Russian border, not far from
Kursk. My father, Sergei, worked on
land owned by the Schaufus family.
He was a farmhand, and so was my
mother. Unlike the landowners, we did
not live well.
My mother earned extra money by
taking in washing. She, like her father,
who was a soldier in the Tsar’s army
for 25 years (serfs in those days had
to serve for 25 years), was very religi-
ous. I remember the dark faces of the
saints on the icons, made dark by the
fumes from the oil lamps. I remember
also at church the children were
taught to kneel in front of the icons
and pray with the grown-ups. There,
we children were also taught reading,
writing, and the scriptures.
We children usually went barefoot
from spring until late autumn. Boots
were a dream for anyone in the villages
of those days. Handkerchiefs and ties
were unknown. We wiped our noses
on our sleeves and kept up our trousers
with a piece of string.
I went to school in Kalinovka. My
teacher, Lydia Schevchenko, was an
atheist and a rebel, and was one of
those who gave me my first political
ideas. After school and on Saturdays
I cleaned boilers at the mine, to earn
extra money.
My father wanted me to be a shoe-
maker, but I chose to be a mechanic’s
apprentice. I remember one day driv-
ing up proudly on a motor-bike I had
rebuilt from scrap.
In 1912 I took part in a strike and
lost my job. I found other jobs, first
in a coalmine owned by a French com-
pany. This was when I married for
the first time. My wife’s name was
Galina, but she died in the time of
famine after 1921. This was a great
sadness. It left me with two children
to look after, my son, Leonid, and my
daughter, Julia. Leonid was killed in
World War 11, fighting as a pilot, but
Julia is married and lives with her
family in Kiev. (In 1924 I was married
again, to Lydia Petrovna.)
After the Revolution, in 1917, I
continued my political work, and soon
I joined the Communist Party. From
there I entered the Red Army as a
political worker and propagandist.
I trusted Stalin and we had good
relations. When he died I grieved
sincerely, even wept. It seemed to me,
and to many others, that Beria was
responsible for all the arrests and that
Stalin did not know about them.
The first time I met Stalin was in
1926, at the 14th Party Congress. In
those days Stalin impressed me very
much. I was photographed with him.
He was joking, and very human.
On rebuilding Russia:
I consider that in the early days of
his activities Stalin did a lot to convert
backward Russia into an advanced
industrial State later on, however,
when he grew older and fell under the


influence of Beria, his actions resulted
in more harm than good.
Stalin was a Communist and a real
revolutionary, but he was also a real
despot. I told my comrades at the time
of the 20th Party Congress that we had
to tell the truth about why there had
been mass arrests. If not, it would be
too late to speak out, since those who
had been arrested in 1937, and sur-
vived, had begun to return to their
homes.
At the 16th Party Congress, I
received a permanent guest pass because
I was the secretary of the Party Organ-
isation of the Industrial Academy. I
always occupied elected positions in
the Party, and I am very glad fate
led me to follow the social and politi-
cal path I did. I was close to the helm
which directed the, huge ship of state
in the reconstruction of our country.
The period from 1935 was a period,
I should say, of great progress in the
Party, in the country, and in industrial-
isation for instance, the construction
of the factories in Moscow - the ball-
bearing factory oil and gas plants —•
and the development of electrical instal-
lations.
There was also Dux Number One—
a plane factory that was widened and
enlarged—then there was the recon-
struction of Moscow: by present stan-
dards the city was very small, but in
those days the opportunities were dif-
ferent —it was a stupendous work and
it all fell to me as Second Secretary,
because Kaganovich was up to his ears
in work. Everything was tumultuous
—the building of the Moscow-Volga
Canal was begun and the bridges over
the Moscow River had to be recon-
structed.
On Mao Tse Tung:
Mao is a petit bourgeois with a
peasant nature to whom the working
class, the proletariat, were alien from
the very beginning. His main stake he
always placed on the peasants. I
remember my conversation with Mao
when I went to China in 1959. It con-
cerned our relations with the United
States of America.
It was at this time that he was
assuring me that an Atom Bomb was
a paper tiger. He would listen to no
arguments. He tried to persuade me
to do one thing: Comrade Khrush-
chev,” he told me, “you have only to
start. You just provoke the Americans
to military action and I will give you
as many people as you wish 100
divisions, 200 divisions, 1000 . . .”
I explained to him that, with contem-
porary technique, his divisions, evem
thousands, mean nothing, because one
or two rockets would be enough to
turn all the divisions into dust. He
disagreed with me, obviously regarding
me as a coward.
On American leaders:
If I were to compare the two Ameri-
can Presidents whom I met, the com-
parison would obviously not be in favor
of Eisenhower. Judging from the
opinion of people who knew Eisen-
hower as a military leader and as a
statesman, they did not hold him in
much respect either in one field or in
the other.
They considered him a mediocre
general and a weak President because
of the softness of his character, but one
must admit that he is a good man.
Obviously being a President and
ruling the country was a great burden
for him. Eisenhower, when he had
any more or less important negotiations,
would, at every question I put forward,
immediately turn to his advisers and
aides demanding explanations or
answers to my questions.
When I came to the States and met
Eisenhower in the. White House, the
first thing I did was begin to attack
Nixon. Eisenhower looked at me in
embarrassment. Nixon, that son-of-a-
bitch, had given an interview saying all
sorts of things. Eisenhower later admit-
ted that he hadn’t seen it.
Nixon was pushed along by
McCarthy, and when McCarthy began,
during his lifetime, as one might say,
to fade Nixon turned his back on him.
He is an unprincipled puppet, and that
is dangerous.
I have a very low opinion of Nixon,
very, and I thought that Henry Cabot
Lodge was cleverer than Nixon. Lodge
went with me when I was in the
States and I spent a lot of time with
him and talked to him. He’s no fool.
He likes jokes. He is a Major-General
and when we were taking our seats I
usually remarked in fun, “You are not
allowed to sit down first because I am
a Lieutenant-General and you are only
a Major-General.” He would laugh. I
shall never forget.
When I saw President Kennedy in
Vienna in 1961 I told him “the fact
that you became President was due to
us. We made you President.” He asked
me how he should understand that. I
said, “I’ll tell you how. You collected
200,000 more votes than Nixon. Nixon
asked us for Powers, the U-2 pilot, to
be released . . . and if we had done
it, he would have received half a mil-
lion votes just for that because
that would have shown that Nixon
could have established better contacts
with the Soviet Union.
“But we guessed his plans. We deci-
ded not to give him any answer, and
just to give it to you when you
moved into the White House. So what
do you think of that?” I asked Ken-
nedy. He said, “I agree with you
entirely. If you had not acted the way
you did, Nixon would definitely have
got his 200,000 votes.”
So I said, “That is the way I voted
for you and our votes pulled you over
the line.” And this is a fact. And Nixon
wanted it.
I had met Kennedy as a Senator in
1959 on a visit to the United States.
The Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee held a reception in my honor.
There, Lyndon Johnson introduced
me to Kennedy.
I was surprised that he could be so
young and be a Senator, so I said •—•
not because I singled him out “I
have heard that despite your youth
you have a big future ahead of you.”
Kennedy smiled and silently shook my
hand. And so in Vienna I saw this
young man in front of me again, but
already in the role of President of the
biggest capitalist country in the world,
the United States.
Mr. Kennedy made a very strong
impression on me, both as a man and as
a statesman. I like the way he, unlike
Eisenhower, had his personal opinion on
all questions we discussed . . . Kennedy
was entirely different from Eisenhower
and had a precisely formulated answer
to every question. Apparently he had
thought them out before and they
corresponded to his main line of
thought, to his personal point of view.
I liked his face, sometimes stern and
at other times lightened by a really
good-natured smile.
Although in Vienna we came to no
concrete agreement, I was pleased with
the meeting and understood that
although President Kennedy was young
he was obviously interested in finding
ways to avoid conflict with the Soviet
Union and somehow to solve those
problems which might lead to war.
Kennedy was a real statesman. Unfor-
tunately, I did not have a chance to
meet him in the United States nor in
our country.
Neither he nor I wanted war, so dur-
ing the Caribbean crisis we established
direct communication between the
Kremlin and the White House. Kennedy
had a talent for solving international
conflicts by negotiation. I had proof
of this during the so-called Cuban
crisis! I think if Kennedy had been
alive today we would have had an
excellent relationship with the United
States, because he would never have
let his country get into such a sticky
situation as it is now in Vietnam.
When Cuba was invaded I heard
about it on the radio, but we didn’t
know who had done the invading,
whether it was the Cuban counter-
revolutionaries or Americans —but, all
the same, we thought that, no matter
under what disguise, the invasion must
be taking place with American partici-
pation.
On the Cuban crisis:
I would like to explain the situation,
leading up to the conflict with Cuba.
When we learned that a new socialist
State had appeared not far from
American shores, I understood that it
would not last long if we didn’t help
it so that it would have time to recover
its strength and rest from the struggle
which it had just gone through.
And so I decided, after consulting
my colleagues, to send some rocket
units to Cuba. Naturally, before doing
this, I put the question to the mem-
bers of the Presidium. I told them,
“If we don’t do this, Cuba will
fall.” We were sure that the
Americans would never leave Cuba
alone and let it develop as a socialist
country because Cuba would act as

a magnet to the South American coun-
tries. Sometime in October of 1962
I don’t remember the exact date, the
President of the Untied States said
that they had better take measures.
They concentrated their navy and
almost surrounded the island. Then
planes were got ready and paratroops
and infantry. So they mobilised their
huge forces and things began to hum
. . . I must confess that I slept one
night in my study fully dressed on the
sofa. I did not want to be in the
position of one Western Minister who,
during the Suez crisis, rushed to the
telephone without his trousers. The
following day when the conflict was
over, I slept quietly in my bed at home.
The American Press made a lot of
fuss about the Russians bringing roc-
kets to Cuba and planning to capture
the United States. Perhaps we shouldn’t
have done it. But if rockets had not
been installed, would there be a Cuba
now? No, it would have been wiped
out. And if that is true, it means that
our transportation of rockets was justi-
fied.
We took our rockets and bombers
away in exchange for President Ken-
nedy’s promise not to invade Cuba.
And this should have gained at least six
years’ quiet . . . because I was sure
Kennedy would have been re-elected
for a second term.
And I am not ashamed that, as the
newspapers wrote, I made concessions
to the American President and ordered
the removal of the rockets from Cuba.
We told Comrade Castro and the other
Comrades that if Kennedy broke his
word, all the means that we had are
still in our possession, and the threat
which he, Castro, held against the
United States in defence of Cuba re-
mained on our territory, so that if the
situation required we could use it.
We must give credit to the United
States, and first of all to President
Kennedy, who also showed sense and
cool-headedness. He gave us his
promise to carry out his part and we
carried out ours. And that’s the way
we liquidated the possibility of begin-
ning a nuclear war. After President
Kennedy’s death, President Johnson,
who took over, assured us that he
would stick to the promises made by
President Kennedy. So far, they have
not been violated.
It is hard to say what might have
happened if we hadn’t shipped the
rockets back. Some people say prob-
ably there would not have been a war.
Probably not. I don’t know. I couldn’t
give any assurance about that.
So who was right and who was
wrong? What was the American aim?
They aimed to liquidate socialist Cuba.
The invasion of the Cuban emigres
was part of the American plan. And
our aim was to preserve Cuba, and
Cuba still exists ...
My prestige increased, and this will
never fade, and for a long time people
will remember it, and even now the
letters I receive at New Year and
Christmas usually underline this fact.

New iron, as good as old
Recapturing the charm of the past
By MARGO RATCLIFFE
TWO OF THE MOST sought-after
items among home-builders in Sydney
at the moment are hand-made sand-
stock bricks and genuine “signed”
cast-iron lace. However, if you haven’t
managed to secure your supplies of
these fashionable items, reproductions
of both are now being turned out in
quantity.
The enterprising Enfield Brickworks
are making “old” bricks, fully machine-
made, of course, but blasted with sand
as they come out of the oven to given
them that weathered look. They are
stronger than the original sandstocks,
cost $78.75 per thousand, including de-
livery, which can be as far as Canberra.
Colors range from soft cream to purp-
lish-brown.
Lovers of cast-iron lace can buy their
supplies at Grace, Bros., Sydney, which
is selling unpainted panels, two feet in
length and available in four well-known
designs, for $9.45.
Mr. H. W. Marks, head of Bertma
Trading Cojnpany, which is supplying
the panels, says that they are exact
copies of the original 19th-century
patterns. These were cast in wooden
patterns which were intricately carved
by hand, an uneconomical proposition
today.
Mr. Marks’ lace is cast in a metal
mould, which is hardier and lasts longer
than wood, but some of the smaller
detail in the panels cast from the
wooden patterns is lost. For instance,
the signature and dates engraved on
the 19th-century cast-iron lace do not
appear in today’s castings.
Mr. Marks said that aluminium
panels produced in the last year or
two had proved unsatisfactory. They
tended to buckle.
Demand for genuine 19th-century
cast iron continues strong. Jim Martin,
owner of a shop called Colonial
Heritage on Sydney’s North Shore,
has been collecting cast iron since
1960. At one time he had 100 tons in
the back garden of his shop, all of
which has now been sold to customers
all over Australia, in England, and the
United States.
Mr. Martin said that Lord Vestey
bought about 20 yards of it to enclose
his London house. Lord Vestey thought
he was extremely lucky to find such
a large batch of cast-iron panels in
the one pattern.
However, M \ Martin has lost a lot
of his enthusiasm for trading in cast
iron; the margin of profit has shrunk.
He refuses to cast new panels because,
he says, it is like making a copy of an
antique piece of furniture: expensive,
beautifully finished, but not the real
thing.
Mr. Martin will not accept the com-
monly held theory that the original
cast-iron panels came to Australia from
England as ballast in sailing ships.
“From my experience only about
five percent of the cast iron in Aus-
tralia is English,” he said. “Most of
it is Australian-made. The first
English panels came in the 1840 s. If
they had been thrown down in the
hold as ballast they would have been
broken. Cast iron is brittle. The ballast
is far more likely to have been big
hunks of pig iron.
“Australia started making cast iron
in the 1860 s, and by the 1870 s there
were 70 foundries in and around Syd-
ney turning it out. There were four in
Goulburn and a dozen in Newcastle.”
Mr. Martin has been searching for
some of the original wooden patterns,
but has found that almost every foundry
which might have had them has had
a fire at some time in the past and
most of the wooden patterns have been
burnt. He has managed to trace one set
but the owner is prudently holding on
to it. “I’ll make an offer when the
time is ripe,” Mr. Martin said.
Dealers in cast iron used to bring
back truckloads of the stuff from
country districts. Now the trend is
reversed and truckloads are going from
dealers back to property owners in
the country. But owners of country
hotels are often willing to sell their
cast iron.
Modern architects are enthusiastic
about the warm color and sympathetic
texture of the speckled, hand-made
sandstock bricks, which are fetching,
according to demolishers’ advertise-
ments, up to $5O a thousand.
However, the bricks are not the best
for load-bearing walls; the inner wall,
which carries the main load, is gener-
ally of safer, modern bricks. More
important is the fact that sandstocks
are extremely unsympathetic to modern
mortar; the edges of the brick fret
away within a few years unless a lime
mortar, with perhaps 10 percent
cement, is used.
Many a proud owner of a fretting
sandstock feature wall might be even
more cast down to learn that only
bricks made before 1850 are authentic
hand-made sandstocks. After 1850,
machines were installed. Most of the
old Sydney houses now being demol-
ished were built from machine-made
bricks.
The laborious method used to make
the original sandstocks explains why
the National Trust keeps a small selec-
tion of them on display at Experi-
ment Farm Cottage, Parramatta. The
clay was dug out with spades, spread
to weather in the sun for a few days,
then mixed with water and left again
to temper. Handful by handful, the
mixture was then flung into wooden
moulds B|in. x 2iin. The “green”
bricks were then turned out and dried
in a shed before firing.
Sand was dusted inside the moulds
to stop the clay adhering to the sides.
Some of the sand was baked into the
clay, hence the name. The bricks were
not made only by convicts as popu-
larly supposed; free men and soldiers
worked in the brickfields. The arrow
found on some early bricks is a Board
or Ordnance insignia.
A more important find for brick
enthusiasts would be a thumbprint,
planted there by the moulder as a
check on the number of bricks he had
made. Some sandstocks were recently
found at Mudgee, with the imprint of
a spade, a diamond, and a heart on
them. At Yass is a famous brick with
the imprint of a sheep’s hoof, and
bricks recently unearthed at Old
Government House, Parramatta, have
the footprints of a possum.
Mr. John Morris, of the National
Trust, who provided most of this in-
formation about sandstocks, would like
to see all early sandstocks kept for
restoration of historic buildings, instead
of being squandered on feature walls.

OVERSEAS
How to be friends
with the British
From Harvey Stockwin, in London
WITH DETAILS announced last
week of the British pull-out from
South-East Asia, Australians in Britain
were also asking to what real extent
the British are still interested in
Australia.
Superficially, Australia and Austra-
lians are more in the news in Britain
than they were ten or 15 years ago.
Australian sportsmen continue to
gather a more than proportionate share
of the headlines. Rolf Harris is a
popular TV performer ironically,
sponsoring Britain’s only winning entry
into Europe, the Eurovision song con-
test. Also on TV, Australian and Eng-
lish high schools engage in simultan-
eous combat. And so on.
But all this increasing general
knowledge and awareness has only lim-
ited political meaning. For one thing,
it is definitely not true to say that there
is also increasing awareness of the
problems of, for example, Malaysia and
Singapore. They are remote and largely
unknown, compared with Australia.
But even what interest there is in Aus-
tralia, does not alter the fact that those
who matter in England expect Australia
to increasingly go her own way, even
as they will go theirs.
Just how much this has already hap-
pened on the English side is brought
home when one talks to the many
Australian visitors to their “Far West.”
Gripes about immigration and job re-
strictions, and other bureaucratic regu-
lations, are common. There are gripes,
too, about the inconsistent ways restric-
tions are imposed.
“I’ve had England,” stormed one
Australian to me this week. He had
been charged custom duties as if he
was a resident, yet failed to get a tax
or national insurance rebate because of
non-resident regulations. “If they are
cutting the umbilical cords, maybe we
should, too,” he said.
Instinctive reference to “our old
relationship,” “traditional ties,” “close
bonds,” apart from being largely irrele-
vant, also clouds the issues and obscures
real interests. A Malaysian foreign cor-
respondent based in Australia could be
forgiven for feeling that, post-con-
frontation, Australia was forgetting
what confrontation recalled for Mal-
ayan people that kinship is by no
means the soundest basis for coalitions.
This is not to say that judicious
appeals to the sentiments behind the
“traditional ties” might not occasion-
ally serve the national interest. This
can work both ways, and the suspicion
is that the British have recently been
better at it. For it is fairly evident that
Australia, New Zealand, Singapore,
and Malaysian leaders were requested
to keep the East of Suez question from
becoming a noisy wrangle. “Close
bonds” being what they are, the
request was complied with.
But should it have been? Or would
it have been better to appeal to the
British people rather than privately
pressure Mr. Wilson’s Government?
On the one hand, I recollect what
a local electrician asserted when we
were discussing these things: “I reckon
if the Australian Prime Minister came
out and said he felt Australia was being
sold down the river, he’d make a hell
of an impact.” De Gaulle is very near
the truth in assuming many Britons are
not natural Europeans.
On the other hand, the fact remains
that Wilson’s request for restraint was
in his interest. If pro-Commonwealth
feeling were aroused it would be that
much more difficult for him to satisfy
both his party and his electorate. He
is a past-master at getting his oppon-
ents or allies to tie their own hands
behind their backs.
The net effect has been for East of
Suez opponents to have things all their
own way. Were there more hard think-
ing in terms of Anglo-Australian rela-
tions, maybe the response to Wilson’s
appeal would have been as calculated
as his appeal probably was. Anglo-
American relations have been as close
and as distant as they are partly
because both countries easily think of
themselves as separate entities.
The vast, rambling bureaucracy of
Australia House, now spilled over into
Canberra House, too, symbolises that
this is not sufficiently so in the Anglo-
Australian case. Old-fashioned as it
now is, dominating one end of the
Strand, Australia House, still under
the Prime Minister’s Department, also
symbolises a fault. As one inhabitant
pointed out to me, it is a continuing
legacy from the days when Britain
and Australia were thought of as one.
That the Australian presence in
London should be primarily diplomatic
would seem self-evident. Then, when
the wheel revolves, and Britain is again
more outward-looking, Australia could
take full advantage of that situation.
And since numerous Australians are sure
to continue flowing far westward,
pressure could then be more forcibly
brought to bear to safeguard their inter-
ests and to see that they are treated
uniformly.
Then, too, regular Anglo-Australian
Ministerial meetings might sooner be
held to iron out differences (as they
are between Britain and Canada and
Britain and Japan).
When that is so, maybe there will be
a little more imagination in our rela-
tionship. Back in the days when the
British Government was still likely to
renew the aircraft carrier fleet, some-
one might have alleviated today’s
anxieties by planning a joint, shared-
cost aircraft carrier.
Having once suggested this idea to a
high officer on board HMS Eagle, it
was gratifying to learn that he, a Briton,
had skippered an RAN ship with a
largely New Zealand crew.
Perhaps only when Anglo-Australian
relations grow even further apart, into
areas of real independence, will it be
possible to rise above the present
fractious level. Maybe Australians and
Britons will even become as friendly as
Britons and the Japanese.
The Arabs
Their choices
THE CHOICES OPEN to the Arab
leadership are hard and clear. The
first concern of the Arab leaders has
been to improve their military position
from its present state of virtual
defencelessness.
The second question facing them is
whether they can themselves now or
in the foreseeable future compel Israel
to withdraw its forces unconditionally
by military or diplomatic means. If not,
will any other power Russia or
America or a combination of both or
the UN do this for them? If the
answer again is no, what can they
afford to concede to achieve an Israeli
withdrawal?
The Arab Governments appear to
be in no doubt about their inability
to resume war in the near future. But
the Syrians and Algerians seem to be
more sanguine than Egypt or Jordan
about the possibility of restoring
enough Arab strength within a year or
two to provide a backing for guerilla
operations inside territory now occu-

pied by Israel if the Israelis do not
withdraw.
The Russians have been sending air-
craft and other weapons to restore
some sort of defensive capacity to
Egypt and Syria, but are believed to
have made it plain that the Arabs can
expect no Russian military help in
recovering lost territory. At the same
time, the Russians are ready to give
Egypt, Syria, and Iraq economic help
to enable them to maintain a pro-
longed diplomatic struggle.
The U.S. is also obviously not going
to compel the Israelis to withdraw
unconditionally. Nor is the UN.
In negotiations there are two prob-
lems involved. There is a problem of
timing. How should withdrawal,
negotiation, and settlement be related?
Then there is the problem of how far
each side is prepared to go in making
concessions.
It is the Arabs who face the more
difficult and far-reaching decisions.
Should they seek a quick peace to get
a major Israeli withdrawal, even if the
terms include such politically indiges-
tible elements as a formal declaration
of non-belligerence or some recognition
of the State of Israel? If they decide
that the Israeli terms for withdrawal
are too stiff, can they afford to wait
with the Israelis in occupation? What
pressures can they bring to bear on
Israel to move or ease her terms?
Jordan, the hardest hit of the Arab
States, appears to be the strongest
advocate of a quick peace. At the
other extreme, Syria and Algeria tend
toward the rejection of any major
political concessions now. President
Nasser has been keeping his thoughts
to himself recently, but the indications
are that Cairo’s position may lie some-
where in between.
In return for an Israeli withdrawal,
it might be envisaged that the Arab
States would accept the internationally
supervised free passage of ships
through the Strait of Tiran, though
not specifically through the Suez Canal.
They would agree to a series of de-
militarised zones around their frontiers
with Israel, including the Gaza Strip
Nasser with Algerian, Iraqi, and
Syrian leaders in Cairo... whose
move next?

and the Syrian heights, under UN
supervision preferably on both sides of
the border. They would accept inter-
nationally guaranteed free access for
all to the Holy Places in Jerusalem,
but no other change in the status of the
West Bank of Jordan except for minor
frontier changes for security reasons.
But if terms such as these are re-
jected by Israel as not good enough,
the Egyptian leaders may feel they have
no alternative but to wait and perhaps
eventually to adopt the Syrian and
Algerian thesis of guerilla warfare.
But more war or a prolonged diplo-
matic and economic struggle could
mean a heavy loss to Egypt or its
increased dependence on the Soviet
Union and greater estrangement from
the West.
Both Arabs and Israelis have to be
convinced that justice as well as force
plays its part in a settlement. Only
then may they begin to see that their
quarrels and claims, however heart-
rending and passionate, are less im-
portant in the long run than the danger
of distorting their whole economic and
social development and of making their
whole area a focus of Great Power
rivalry and cold war.
Japan
A home "front"
IN JAPAN, things are often not what
they seem, and this phenomenon of
illusion is accurately reflected in the
current moves to “liberalise” controls
on foreign participation in Japanese in-
dustry. This month, 50 selected in-
dustries are being opened to foreign
investment, and at first glance this
might seem to confirm the popular
Australian view of Japan as an astonish-
ingly efficient economy with nothing to
fear from outsiders.
But here there is a dual illusion.
Firstly, Japanese industries are often
far from well run by international
standards and enjoy a protection which
is paid for by the domestic consumer
he is forced to buy the products of
feather-bedded, unprogressive firms
whose survival depends on keeping
efficient foreigners out. And, secondly,
the liberalisation moves are, to all in-
tents and purposes, meaningless.
Restrictions have been lifted on
foreign investment in 17 industries and
controls relaxed in 33 others. The en-
terprises affected are mainly those in
which Japanese manufacturers enjoy
a strong position in export markets, or
have some special advantage in obtain-
ing raw materials. Bluntly, these indus-
tries have nothing to fear from entry of
overseas capital, and it is more than
probable that they are of the least inter-
est to the foreign investor. Nor do the

selected industries represent more than
a tiny portion of Japan’s industrial
economy.
The so-called liberalisation, however,
serves an important purpose for Japan
allows it continuing membership of
the 21-nation Organisation for Econo-
mic Co-operation and Development. Al-
ready under strong criticism by other
members of OECD for maintaining
barriers which kept foreign capital’s
role down to an absolute minimum,
Japan expected further disquiet to fol-
low a recent Paris meeting of the
OECD Committee for Invisible Trans-
actions. But with its liberalisation plan
Japan forestalled its critics for the
time being.
The Foreign Investment Council of
Japan worked out the new system and
gave Japanese business, almost intact,
the protection it fought tooth and nail
to retain. The Council recommended
that for “Group A” industries
foreigners should be given automatic
approval for investment in projects
where at least half the capital will re-
main in Japanese hands. But the Gov-
ernment retains power to impose re-
strictions if real control of a project
will rest in the hands of foreigners.
The industries in this group include
domestic electric appliances, fertilisers
and farm chemicals, canned fish and
soup, technical services for the building
industry, rolling stock, marine engines,
and some shipyards. Color TV sets and
air-conditioners have been excluded be-
cause the Japanese feel there is room for
expansion of domestic sales of these pro-
ducts unlike electric fans, refrigera-
tors, and washing machines and this
would give foreign investment an oppor-
tunity to win a foothold in the Japan-
ese market.
“Group B” industries those with
no restriction on the proportion of
foreign-owned shares include the
smaller shipyards, certain sectors of
steel and textile industries, cement, silk
reeling, tourist agencies and hotels,
pianos, organs, beer, monosodium gluta-
mate, and motor-cycles. Fighting
strongly to keep steel and motor-cycles
off the free list, despite the immense
strength of these industries, the Japan-
ese interests came up with the argu-
ment that the stronger an industry is
the greater the danger of falling victim
to foreign penetration.
Foreign capital has been advised to
put a good face on its operations by ap-
pointing as many Japanese as possible
to boards of directors; also warned
against mass dismissals and closing
down of plants, and asked to co-operate
in maintaining “law and order in the
industrial world.”
The most real development is that
Japanese industrialists have been given
notice that foreign capital cannot be
kept out indefinitely. The most they
can hope for is that the Government
will resist international pressures long
enough to allow protected domestic pro-
ducers time to prepare for increased
competition from overseas.

Economic Review," Hong Kong)

Opera: the problems of success
THE SPECTACULAR sell-out of the
Elizabethan Theatre Trust’s opera
season, due mainly to the introduction
of subscriptions, seems to have created
almost as many problems as it has
solved.
The Trust’s executive director, Mr.
Stefan Haag, and its director of opera
promotion, Mr. Harry Miller, are at
the moment very much aware that in
Sydney by turning people away they
may be doing themselves more perma-
nent damage than by having half-empty
houses.
They are, in fact, on delicate ground
in Sydney, which has had full lists
for ABC concert subscribers for years,
with consequent frustration of music-
lovers who are unable to get subscrip-
tions. If it seems now that opera sub-
scriptions in Sydney (together with
the possibility of permanent seats in
the Opera House) are now the sort of
thing which parents will leave in their
will to their children, the Trust with
opera may be quite as unpopular as
the ABC has been with some would-
be concertgoers.
When subscriptions in Sydney sold
out so rapidly, the Trust had canvassed
any possibility of a larger theatre than
the Tivoli. They even thought of tra-
ditional picture-theatres like the Regent,
which, in fact, is owned by J.C. Wil-
liamson, but although such a theatre
would be ideal for audiences it has no
stage facilities.
However, the sell-out has many
cheerful features. Opera season tickets
are still more expensive than ABC con-
cert subscriptions, mainly because the
overall resources of the Trust are still
much smaller than the ABC’s. But the
Elizabethan now has more subscribers
to opera than the ABC has concert
subscribers, except in Sydney.
Sydney has 9000 opera subscribers
as against about 9700 for concerts. The
size of the Tivoli, the Trust believes,
is the limiting factor in Sydney. But
there is no thought of extending the
season. This, the Trust feels, would be
a breach of faith with subscribers who
have already received tickets; they
would be rightly frustrated and angry
to feel that later applicants might now
be getting the front row of the dress
circle.
The sell-out of houses will not
achieve a higher net result for the
Opera Company. Mr. Haag pointed
out that, whereas in previous seasons
only about 60 percent of seats had been
sold, this time about 100 percent had
been sold, but at prices about 40 per-
cent cheaper.
However, the Trust claims that the
overall cost of promotion, although it
has involved elaborate brochures dis-
tributed by department stores and the
use of many popular personalities, has
been less than in previous years. In
previous seasons, Mr. Haag said, with
poor initial response, a great deal had
had to be spent in buying masses of
newspaper advertising space; now all
that would be needed was a one-inch
reminder about times of performance.

John Coburn. Tapestries, Hungry

Arthur Boyd. Tapestries, Clune Gallery,
Sydney.
THE ’SIXTIES look like being the
era when abstraction showed its flag
in the form of tapestries not pure
abstraction because John Olsen, John
Coburn, and Arthur Boyd celebrate,
however obliquely, the symbolic image.
The first Australian tapestry, only
equalled by Coburn’s, was Olsen’s foie
de Vivre (71in. x 94in.) of 1964, with
its lively linear lyricism as fresh as the
day it was conceived; in 1966 Galleries
Lasalle showed 23 Aubusson tapestries
and from Aubusson come Coburn’s
three splendid pieces, while Boyd’s and
Olsen’s new works come from the same
weavers in Portugal.
The revival of Aubusson began With
Lurcat in 1937; in 1945 he formed
L’Association des Peintures Cortonniers
de Tapisseries. He kept his eye on
verdure and traditional motifs, worship-
ping the sun, its chanticleer, the grape
it ripened and the wheat it yellowed;
fine examples of his work are at Anzac
House, Sydney, and the Art Gallery of
N.S.W., which bought one, 120 in. x
96in., for $4233 in 1966.
Verdure is the name Olsen has given
to his 74in. x 96in. work; when secular
tapestry turned to chivalry and love in
the mid-fourteenth century, verdure was
a principal feature and, as the Songe
du Verger had it, was to obliterate
stone walls and show “the fair and open
face of heaven.” (Of course, there
were secular tapestries long before this
the Bayeux Tapestry, 230 ft. long, of
1073-83, narrates the Norman colonisa-
tion of England.)
Olsen’s new works, hardly celebra-
tory, see the heavens more as the
astronomer’s design than the astrologer’s
zone of myths, for his pale geometrical
shapes are tidily inert, probably as a
result of his trying to reduce the
forced tensions, optical compulsion and
clamorous color of much hard-edge
painting, but he has also subdued his
natural ebullience and invention. Yet
Arthur Boyd could have subdued the
pressures in his work with some of
Olsen’s cool poise, for his Nebuchad-
nezzar's Dream (96in. x 132 in., $5500)
is a crisply curved whirlpool of sharp-
edged, flat areas entwined and con-
voluted, with the energy of his draw-
ing made a little too emphatic by the
uninflected color. He tries to harness
the flat areas and the bright color
both foreign to him to expressionism;
a great, yellow tear-drop, a pink-mauve
whale and a dull green contend on a
ground of deep blue. Though the tor-
sion and the brilliance of color are a
little relentless, the variation of pace
in the whirl, contraction and expansion
of forms is stunning.
Like Rime of the Ancient Mariner
(57in. x 90in., $1850), it swarms with
fertilisation symbols, but_ in the Rime
the rhythm, like Coleridge’s “furrow
that follows free,” flows with a lighter
ease as, it seems, the water-snakes,
blessed unawares by the Mariner and
part of the world’s verdure, swim across
the bloody sun at noon. The riot of
forms is held together by a grand,
diagonal, blue s-shape and is given
calmness by a great, white whale-shape.
(How did Moby Dick swim into “The
Ancient Mariner”? Perhaps it is part
of the Melburnian imagination, for in
1940 Nolan was recording his fascin-
ation with Melville.)
This rhapsodic tapestry, which has
none of the Guernica-grimness of Boyd’s
drawings on the same theme, reminds
us, with its powerful flatshapes, of how
pop artists have turned to flags and
banners (Lichtenstein’s Pistol of 1964,
for instance) and suggests that tapestry
may be following the flag and pennant.
Usually, however, tapestries soften
edges, let a delicately pervasive light
encompass all, emphasise the single-
ness of theme by the heterogeneity of
materials, melt edges, and give thin,
hard surfaces as in Corbusiers’ paint-
ing, a matt resilience. We know that
Mary McCarthy has told Harold
Rosenberg that an event cannot be
hung on a wall, but we incline to think


a painting is an event and a tapestry
a comment on it; spontaneity is reduced
and the sung-lyric becomes the reflec-
tive sonnet.
Coburn is a natural for the trans-
formation; his Genesis (70in. x 84in.,
$2750) places intricately simple, black
foliate-bird forms, edged with white
on a ground of elusive mauve-beige (I
think); his Temple II (72in. x 50in.,
$2700) is about to form a glowing
escutcheon and his magnificent In
Praise of the Sun (83in. x 77in.) is a
glorious encounter of Matisse-like
orange leaf-forms, a yellow-orange sun
and pale mauve flame-leaves, with three
horizontal bands of purple-grey, brown
and black. The disposition of forms is
as natural as the rays of the setting
sun that seems to illuminate them and
there is an impressive poise and serenity
equalling even those of Corbusier’s
Traces de Pas (87in. x 116 in., $8810)
at last year’s Lasalle Aubusson show.
Coburn’s are entrancing tapestries
and do transform the white walls of
the Hungry Horse into a “fair and
open face of heaven.”
Theatre
Saints alive
By MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
Saint Joan. Bernard Shaw. Sydney Uni-
versity Dramatic Society. Union
Theatre. Sydney University.
The Devil’s Advocate. Dore Schary.
Based on the novel by Morris West.
Independent Theatre.
Rapunzel or The Wrong Side of the
Moon. Nicholas Stuart Gray. In-
dependent Theatre for Children.
WHAT QUALIFICATIONS are neces-
sary for sainthood? Both these plays
take up this question, one seriously, the
other superficially.
Shaw’s Saint Joan emerges as a girl
of naturally ascetic temper and a kind
of inspired commonsense, the product
of remarkable intellectual powers. Add
to this outstanding vitality and a dedi-
cation to a cause beyond her own selfish
interests, and you have a portait of
someone rather like George Bernard
Shaw. But Shaw took credit for his own
bright ideas, whereas Joan, in the
fashion of saints, attributed hers to
God, delivered as it were airmail by-
three heavenly messengers, St. Michael,
St. Catherine, and St. Margaret.
Shaw’s explanation of saintliness in-
volves the extraordinary but not the
supernatural. According to him, only
the uneducated believe in miracles. He
has the Archbishop of Rheims explain
Joan’s apparently miraculous recogni-
tion of the disguised Dauphin as due to
the use of her good wits. Nevertheless,
he twice builds up to splendidly
miraculous climaxes with the aid of
Elisabeth Kirkby and Alexander Hay in
“The Devil’s Advocate.” Independent ,
Sydney
apparently miraculous events. Ration-
ally, both the sudden resumption of
egg-laying by the hens of Baudricourt
and the auspicious changing of the
wind to the longed-for westerly at
Orleans can be explained as lucky co-
incidences. But, theatrically, they are
exploited for all they are worth as
miracles by the cunning old artificer
George Bernard Shaw.
Shaw set out to paint a realistic-
portrait of Joan to replace the melo-
dramatic images of her as either a
plaster saint or a grotesque witch. At
the same time he rescues her opponent,
the Roman Catholic Church, from
melodrama. Instead of a set of corrupt
and cruel monsters, he presents the
churchmen as learned and conscientious
men who* sincerely believed they were
acting for the best.
Gabriella Wieder, a sturdy, healthy-
looking girl of great vitality, makes a
good Joan. With her naturally com-
manding presence and rich, strong
voice, she easily dominates the stage
whenever she appears. Too easily, how-
ever. The comedy and the drama which
arise from the spectacle of the straight-
forward and unworldly country girl put-
ting the great lords and subtle church-
men in their places and confounding
them with com monsense, is somewhat
lessened when these gentlemen are
played by Australian students who
mumble and stumble their way through
Shaw’s splendid speeches like a lot of
sheepish schoolboys. There are excep-
tions, including Victor Emeljanow-, the
producer, who has voice and presence.
But the balance of the play is upset.
“The Devil’s Advocate,” a kind of
detective story decked out with religion,
takes a lending-library view of saint-
hood. It is set in a picturesque village
in Italy and the subject for canonisa-
tion is a mysterious and handsome
young Englishman who turned up as a
deserter during World War 11. The
devil’s advocate, who arrives in 1960
to investigate the evidence for Rome,
is also English, a monsignor dying of
cancer. So, too, is the elegant, widowed
Contessa who lives in the great house
on the hill and who had some mysteri-
ous relationship with the deserter.
Finally, so is her house guest, the young
painter Nicholas Black.
The play is well stocked with modern
problems: the Contessa is a nympho-
maniac and the painter a homosexual.
After wallowing in these problems all
through the play, the playwright offers
the following solutions: the Contessa is
to resort to a psychiatrist and, if that
fails, to charitable works and religion;
the homosexual conveniently throws
himself down the rocky slope of the
Contessa’s hill.
The play seems to lose interest in the
saint question after a while. The only
evidence for the young man’s sanctity
is that he was in the habit of perform-
ing miracles and spent some time living
in a cave and writing up his diary,
before surrendering himself to be mur-
dered by the local Communist partisan
leader, “II Lupo.”
Unlike Shaw, who loved a good
miracle, especially when he had just
proved there is no such thing, the
author of this play (how much is due
to Dore Schary and how much to
Morris West?) seems rather shame-
faced about the miracles and does not
dramatise them. Whether this shows
that he does or does not believe in
them is hard to say.
This religious melodrama is excel-
lently produced by Peter Summerton,
who has a very competent cast headed
by Alexander Hay as the dying mon-
signor. Michelle’s picturesque and in-
geniously tiered Mediterranean setting
works very efficiently.
Recently, in reviewing “Fiddler on
the Roof,” I appeared to be saying, be-
cause of a misprint, that this musical,
like most children’s stories, skims
lightly over anything unpleasant. But
it is musicals which tend to shun nasti-
ness, while children’s literature revels
in it.
Mother Gothel, the witch in “Rapun-
zel,” exhibits a most satisfying and
thorough-going unpleasantness. With
her two familiars, the Cat and the Crow,
whom she has enthralled and given
man-like shape and the power of speech,
she manages to cause a great deal of
pain and trouble, before she is finally
outwitted and spellbound in a tree on
the far side of the moon.
“Rapunzel” has plenty of plot and
not too many characters. There is a
lot of noise, and explosions, and spells,
and the witch’s garden gate opens and
closes itself at command. It seems very
luxurious nowadays to have Yoshi
Tosa’s three entirely different settings
- the witch’s garden, Rapunzel’s room
at the top of the high tower, and the
rocky desolation of the wrong side of
the moon, and it is a pleasant change
from economy and single settings.

Museum piece
By ROBERT WARD
The Servant of Two Masters. Goldoni.
Union Hall, Adelaide.
GOLDONI wrote “The Servant of Two
Masters” in 1746 when he was 36. In
the 86 years of his life, he turned out
in French and Italian nearly three hun-
dred comedies, tragedies, and libretti.
He commenced writing at a time when
the commedia dell’ arte had improvised
itself into redundancy, and, by. writing
plays of character, he swung away
from it to a style which had a certain
influence on the course of 18th-century
Italian and French theatre.
In this play the stock dell’ arte char-
acters are still there: the pompous
worthy Pantalone, the lawyer pendant
Dr. Lombardi, Columbine as Smeralina,
Harlequin as Truffaldino, the betrothed
pair, and so on. The difference is that
Goldoni gives them set lines in a defined
plot, and in doing so he displays, for
the historian, his interest in dramatic
Schwarzkopf... at her peak
form as such. The comedy is one of
errors rising from the duplicity of Truf-
faldino, who endeavors to serve two
masters, one a maiden disguised as a
young nobleman, the other her unsus-
pecting lover. In the end all is un-
tangled, lovers are united, marriages
take place, and the old men are satis-
fied.
It is a play of pleasant conceits and
devices, and Wayne Anthony’s direc-
tion makes the most of these, moving
at times with courtly measure, or giv-
ing his comics incessant rush and
tumble. He has set a manner which
falls cleanly between a fully stylised
and a loosely natural mode, and this
remains constant throughout. The cast
strolls on forestage and waits for the
play to begin, and sits watching there
when not actively involved. Tumbling
clowns help lift the curtain or move
Barry Warren’s excellent, ingenious
sets, and they join the action as servants
later. The actors wear costumes of a
Renaissance style and are very poised
and confident. Overall is it one of the
best University Theatre Guild produc-
tions for several seasons.
But is it all worth it? I don’t think
so. Goldoni’s cosy niche in the literary
histories does not warrant such expen-
diture of real talent on what, I would
argue, is a pleasant but simple museum
piece, not even one of his better plays.
Music
Age cannot wither
By JOHN CARGHER
Elisabeth Schwarzkopf Recital. Town
Hall, Melbourne.
THERE WAS MORE to the heart-
warming ovation which greeted Elisa-
beth Schwarzkopf’s return to Australia
than an audience’s greeting to one of
the world’s greatest singers. But then
there is more to Elisabeth Schwarzkopf
than her beautiful voice or a beautiful
face. At 51, fully 29 years after her
debut, her art in the concert hall is
still at its very peak. There is no trace
of aging, the only difference lies in its
natural darkening with the resultant
change of repertoire to the heavier
songs. Yet she again and again gives
miraculous glimpses of that lighter
Schwarzkopf who can still, with abso-
lute conviction, portray a little girl
addressing the inhabitants of a mouse
hole. This is the only secret of great
lieder singing: interpretation. Who
says vocal or facial acting belongs to
the opera house? One visit to hear and
see Schwarzkopf proves the contrary.
Each and every item is a dramatic
representation of the words, supported
by one of the finest vocal techniques
in history.
For once records do not lie. While
a song or two may have been needed
to warm up, once the voice had settled
down we were offered perfection which
never stood in need of retakes. Com-
paring a full evening of lieder by
Schwarzkopf with the many recordings
of singers of the past from Elena
Gerhardt down or up to whatever singer
you may care to name makes one
realise the infinitely higher standards
we have achieved in the performance
and appreciation of music via the
gramophone.
Schwarzkopf’s sheer beauty of voice
almost eclipsed the absolute profession-
alism of the whole concert: the ac-
companiment of Geoffrey Parsons, a
superb artist in his own right; the
balance of musical items, far from
hackneyed, yet so easily acceptable to
all parts of the audience; the exact
and generous estimate of maximum
value offered so as to make an absence
of encores not ungracious and the
delight of the one offered all the more
welcome. Even the choice of encore
Schubert’s “Seligkeit” was as perfect
as its execution.

Television
Aborigines: Act 1
By FRANK ROBERTS
One Man’s World. Commonwealth
Film Unit. Most TV channels last
week.
WHAT KIND OF FILM the Depart-
ment of Territories asked the Com-
monwealth Film Unit to make about
Aborigines, I have no idea. Why Terri-
tories should want such a film made, I
cannot guess. It could show nothing
but a deplorable state of affairs, prob-
ably calling for action, which the
Commonwealth was empowered to take
at the last referendum, and which it
apparently does not intend to pursue.
Does Territories intend to challenge
this consensus of Cabinet opinion, and
if so, what action might it contem-
plate? Taking all 130,000 Aborigines
under its wing, controlling their educa-
tion, providing hordes of social
workers, running the States’ settlements,
building transitional and permanent
housing, fighting other Ministries for
these rights, and in the end finding
itself assailed on all sides as in New
Guinea? Hardly.
Anyway, whatever the sponsor’s
intent, CFU director Robert Kingsbury
has made a worth-while film, retracing
the life and times of one aboriginal,
Clive Williams, who began in a country
town, went bush for a while, married
and lived in a shanty, fringe life, moved
away from the camp (and drink) to
a house at the edge of a town, finally
came to a city, endured its loneliness,
and brought his family to it for the
sake of benefits which, visibly, would
not have made any white family jump
for joy but represented a marvellous
gateway to the Williams’ children.
Kingsbury filmed around sound clips
from more than eight hours of the
Williams’ recollections, which served as
narrative. “The difficulties of using
untrained voices,” mentioned in a
brochure about “One Man’s World,”
seemed to me part of its strength, along
with the almost total use of a hand-
held camera (in remarkably steady
hands), which gave the documentary
not only “maximum flexibility” but also
a believable simulation of reality.
To anyone even vaguely interested
in the local human drama, of which
the Aborigines’ emergence is ,as
important a chapter as the disappear-
ance of the people who used to be
known in the ’2os and ’3os as The
Unemployed, “One Man’s World”
should be Act One.
Perhaps it was Territories’ idea
merely to act the entrepreneur, show
us a few of the facts, graphically, and
leave it to us to decide the shape of
Acts Two and Three. But if so, Clive
Williams’ world only showed a fringe
of the fringe, and we should be able
to look deeper, in other documentaries
as well made as this pace-setting one.

BUSINESS ES
Creeping inflation from
consumer prices
IT WOULD be an extra good year for
the Australian economy if productivity-
increased by more than two percent,
but not an unusual one if wage earnings
rose by more than that figure, as was
the case last year when award wages
alone went up by seven percent. For
this reason we’ve become used to in-
evitable quarterly rises in the Con-
sumer Price Index a sort of creeping
inflation from which nobody benefits
very much but which hurts a lot of
people, especially those on low and
fixed incomes and pensioners.
Usually business gets by; some of it
benefits because it can pass its higher
wage costs on, at least when competi-
tion allows. Early last year competition
seemed to be holding down this buck-
passing. Profit margins took the strain
all round, with some exceptions, of
course.
It has been rather puzzling to econ-
omists why the gap between produc-
tivity and wage cost increases last year
was not more reflected in prices, which
for the first nine months (to March)
rose at a rate of less than two percent
much slower than in the two previous
years. But last week’s revelation that
in the June quarter alone prices in
the six capital cities jumped 1.2 percent,
or at an annual rate of five percent,
and in Victoria (the worst-affected
State) at a rate of 6.4 percent a year,
largely from price increases in food
and housing, provided some sort of
answer. With stocks at a comparatively
low level, with cost inflation still to
come out (as in the clothing industry,
for example), and with effective de-
mand topped up and threatening to
overflow, the big question now is
whether price increases will keep up
the June quarter rate and even exceed
it. (See the Croesus Touch on page 43.)
Incomes policy
Defence by Harrod
UNDER THE PRESSURES of impati-
ence on all sides of industry to go their
own unfettered ways now its economy is
recovering, Britain has dropped the
reins on its incomes policy, to which the
country largely owes the restoration of
its balance of payments position. But
Professor Roy Harrod, now aging, yet
still one of the most respected economic
voices in the land (and whose Oxford
University readership in international
economics is shortly to pass to an Aus-
tralian, W. M. Cordin of the ANU),
has come out strongly in its support in
recent lectures published by Manchester
University Press and now available here
through Melbourne University Press.
Linking his advocacy with J, E.
Isaac’s notion (The Bulletin, July 15)
that we also need an incomes policy
here to hold wages within the bounds
of rising productivity and economic
activity in keeping with our external
circumstances, a union of academic
opinion is forged.
In fact Harrod makes an incomes
policy the first of two postulates in
outlining a new economic policy. The
other is “to eschew deflation in all
cases.” His thesis then runs as follows:
If the incomes policy is effective, al-
though slow working, and in the un-
likely event of the world monetary sys-
tem being adequately reformed, then
we can rely on the incomes policy alone
to get a rectification- of a fundamental
imbalance of payments. If the incomes
policy works, but there is no adequate
reform of the international monetary-
system, then both the incomes policy
and the regular, although intermittent,
use of import controls and export in-
centives would be needed, although
both the latter would only be used
when there was a tuning and precisely
calculated deficit.
In the event of the incomes policy
not being effective and without reform
Sir Roy Harrod: “eschew deflation”
of the international monetary system,
he thinks it would suffice to rely on the
use of an adjustable foreign exchange
rate. Further, if the incomes policy does
not w'ork, and again there is no ade-
quate reform of the international
monetary system, he thinks both an ad-
justable exchange rate and import
controls w'ould be needed (in that case
additional export incentives would not
be needed because exchange rate ad-
justments w'ould serve as a substitute).
Western Australia
Exports of solar salt
THE FIRST SHIPMENT of solar salt
in a new Western Australian industry,
expected to be worth $3 million
annually by 1975, left Shark Bay, 500
miles north of Perth, last week for
southern Japanese ports 15,500 tons
on behalf of Shark Bay Salt “'Ltd. aboard
the Nichizui Maru. Throughput will
start around 250,000 tons a year, which
could be, and is likely to be, built up
readily to double this figure, with one
million tons annually in the longer
term.
The industry emerged from a 1960
visit of Garrick Agnew to the Middle
East; he noted the solar-salt industry
there and the similarity between the
Mediterranean climate and that of the
West. On his return he looked into
Japanese markets, found them favor-
able, and set up Shark Bay Salt, in
which Adelaide Steamship Co. holds a
60 percent equity to his company’s 40
percent. The project was plagued with
technical problems, which set it back
two or three seasons and more than
doubled the anticipated capital outlay.
But, by lining the main brine pond with
300 acres of polythene sheeting in a
new technique in Useless Loop (the
next step would be to move into Useless
Inlet, which is already sealed off), the
company has a highly efficient opera-
tion under way.
The area’s seawater salinity is a high
4.2 percent, and rainfall of lOin. and
evaporation of lOOin. help make this
one of the world’s better areas for this
industry. While the polythene lining was
expensive, it has improved efficiency
greatly. The Middle East’s problems
also enhance the prospects of markets
being found, but the two clinchers are
associated with the iron-ore industry—■
the involvement as buyers of Mitsui
(partners also in the Cliffs iron-ore
venture, to get under way very soon)
and the building of bulk-handling ports.


THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy: The Federal Budget for 1967-68 is
to be brought down on Tuesday, August 15.
A total 68,491 persons were registered unemployed at the
end of June, against some 66,200 for May; they constituted
1.5 percent of the work force. Job vacancies fell back by
2676 to 29,335.
June trading bank advances increased by $44.2 million,
to bring total advances to $3180.9 million; the full 1966-67
year saw a rise of $336.3 million, compared with 1965-66’s
$213.9 million. Deposits in June dropped $45.4 million to
$5264.8 million; they added $272.4 million (previously $246.4
million) over the whole year.
Australia-wide consumer prices went up 1.2 percent during
the June quarter, the chief stimulants being food and housing
costs . . . Hire-purchase outstandings reached a peak $llO4
million at the end of June, $33.8 million more than at June,
1966.
For the markets : Officially, Australian share markets
are at their peak won almost entirely by the tremendous
vigor of BHP and the metals. The bulk of industrials doesn’t
respond in proportion.
Gold shares met much demand in London, yet slipped a
little at the close; equities edge up on quiet trading . . .
Profit-taking tended to trim Wall Street’s gains.
For companies : Oil and miners are crowding the scene
until the company reporting season gets properly under
way . . . “A show of oil” comes from Esso-BHP’s wildcat
Halibut No. 1 (offshore Gippsland), accompanied by a staid
qualification that “the possibility of high gas and/or water
saturation cannot be eliminated” . . . Longreach Oil will
raise $1 million by a one-for-two issue at par, with no
renounceable rights; directors hold high hopes of phosphate
near Mount Isa.
Nickel is still exciting news ... A reserve at Lake
Rebecca (W.A.) has been granted jointly to Consolidated
Goldfields (Aust.) and Lake View and Star; control vests

MEN AND MATTERS
IN MELBOURNE last week with a
world-wide accepted product from New
Zealand and piloting a hard-sell opera-
tion promising to add more Australian
dollars to N.Z.’s depleted kitty of over-
seas funds, Byron Lumsden, general
manager of Cunic Industries Ltd., Wel-
lington, is a travelling salesman with a
big difference. This is epitomised in his
product, movable walls.
Lumsden has been on the move ever
since he graduated in Political Science
at Victoria University just before the
war. He wasn’t long in the N.Z. Civil
Service, one of several spells, when
the Empire Training Scheme took him
to Canada and then to Britain flying
night fighters. Subsequently his moves
up to 1958 saw him in a variety of top
jobs in the N.Z. and British Civil Ser-
vices, all of them gravitating in a pat-
tern toward the private building indus-
try, where he found his metier.
Despite distance, freight, and the
tangled skein of tariff knots, Lumsden
is highly confident that his and a lot
of other N.Z. manufacturing enterprises
are set for success in the Australian
market, a success which could com-
pound if by-law* entry arrangements
worked as well in practice as they do
in Trade Department theory and (it
was our suggestion) if N.Z. exporters
were given a more realistically valued
currency to trade with.
He says his company is only one of
a rapidly increasing number of N.Z.
firms on the move in overseas markets,
imbued with the realisation that the
only way out of his country’s balance
of payments troubles is to get out and
sell. Their reps form an intimate com-
munity, returning home for the weekend
to see their families, as he does. He is
now off to South-East Asia to continue
his one-man onslaught in world mar-
kets, with his next stops Hong Kong,
then Singapore and Bangkok.
THE NEW TOP management pack-
age at Carlton and United Breweries
went into its first serious public rela-
tions exercise with a zip (aluminium
style) last week, to symbolise its future
accessibility to long-thirsting news
media. The latter’s lunchtime invasion
of the oak-panelled board precincts in
the Bouverie Street stronghold would
have made the tight-lipped Carlton
chiefs of the pre-Breheny era turn in
their graves. After decades of silence
served in various capacities close to the
late Sir Reginald Fogarty, for all the
present more easily apprised team, from
Brian J. Breheny to his three assistant
managers and company secretary down,
it was a case of pressures released.
Like Sir Archibald Glenn of ICIANZ,
Breheny hails from Sale, in Gippsland,
where his father had a small brewery
prior to going to Carlton to be head
Byron Lumsden
Brian Breheny
brewer under the present chairman’s
father, Brigadier Cohen. After leaving
Xavier in the early ’thirties, Brian went
into the C & UB laboratory, and when
doing a stint at its plant in Cairns in
1938 met Fogarty. The brew was
joined. In 1948 he became the latter’s
technical assistant, then personal assis-
tant, and, finally, in 1956, his authentic
understudy, as assistant general
manager.
One of his near neighbors and close
friends in St. Georges Rd., Toorak, is
Sir Maurice Nathan, the top local pilot
of the “Courage” challenge to Carlton.
But the appearance of Sir Maurice in
the brewery business, and even driving
a bulldozer on the Courage site at
Broadmeadows, doesn’t scare him. He
expects to keep the friendship and,
above all, be strongly competitive.


THE
CROESUS
TOUCH
The chances of an
upsurge in
private spending
By J. C. HORSFALL
ONE OF THE weaknesses in the Gov-
ernment’s recent White Paper on the
economy was its failure to recognise
that, along with snowballing Govern-
ment expenditure, it is highly likely
that private spending will accelerate as
well and possibly at an even faster rate
than governmental. “If there is a risk
in the outlook,” it stated, “it lies rather
in the possibility that demand as a
whole will rise too fast, and unless
abated, the growth in public authority
expenditure is more likely than any-
thing else to cause that.”
This passage sticks in the mind not
so much because of its implications for
the coming Budget which, if the Treas-
ury follows its nose, must cut back
the rate of growth in Government ex-
penditure. It is rather because it places
too little weight on the possibility of
an upsurge in private sector spend-
ing, that demand could, in fact, be in-
flated by expenditure resulting from
influences other than Government out-
lays. There are several possibilities of
that sort worth considering.
The most obvious of these influences
is wages. Has the Treasury taken full
account of the likely effect on spending
of this month’s $1 rise in the total wage
and of increases resulting from the cur-
rent work value cases, all coming on
top of a 7 percent increase in award
wages since June last year? Wage-
earners in the private sector outnumber
by three to one public servant recipi-
ents of these big increases, so that pub-
lic authority spending would be far
and away the lesser contributor to ris-
ing incomes on wages account.
Even if there is not to be another
wage case for a year, substantial in-
creases in wages incomes are likely to
accrue in the interim by three routes,
through higher awards resulting from
current work values cases about which
the ACTU has now joined the rising
chorus of impatience; an expected in-
crease of 3 percent in the employed
workforce in the coming year, and a
probable increase in wages drift in the
prospectively more buoyant economy.
To take a second and more general
factor, what about the propensity to
spend? In recent months savings depos-
its have been rising faster than for
years. Concurrently with this, consump-
tion expenditure has been moving up
just as strongly. This is a typical situ-
ation in the middle stages of an upswing.
The question is whether these two are
likely to continue to run in parallel,
and for how long. The answer lies more
in the future course of consumer prices
than anything else; the rate of rise in
incomes would be a good second and,
probably, the course of asset values in
general, third. As I see it, prices are
going to rise more rapidly from now
on, if only because I expect more of
the cost inflation repressed in the past
year or two to be released.
THE TREASURY could possibly have
been lulled into a false sense of security
on this by the modest two percent rate
of rise in the consumer price index for
the year to March last, and by an ex-
pectancy that competition will continue
to be strong enough to keep prices
down. If prices do rise more rapidly,
the propensity to spend would increase,
with resultant acceleration affects on
price rises. Of course, the release of
bottled-up cost inflation would have
been only one of several influences,
including increased Government expen-
diture, higher export income, etc., to
have started the chain of effects. What
one can do is to compare the current
position in the economy with what looks
to have been a similar situation in mid-
-1959 (when there was a marked
strengthening in the propensity to spend
which foreshadowed the spending spree
of the following year) and examine
some of the various forces at work in
both years.
If, as could well be the case, we are
moving into a 1959-60 situation, it is
instructive to look both at the latter’s
economic antecedents and what
developed from them. The seeds of the
big upswing in consumption expendi-
ture in the winter of 1959, which ulti-
mately led on to the speculation-ridden
upsurge the following year, were sown
in the deficit spending of the Govern-
ment in 1958-59 financial year and its
accompanying heavy public works ex-
penditure. Important factors in financ-
ing these were unprecedented bank
support for the loan market and a big
net increase in the issue of Treasury
bills by the Reserve Bank over the
year. This bears a striking resemblance
to what happened in 1966-67.
In 1966-67, as in 1958-59, the role
cast for the banking system has been
a dual one. In the first place, the banks
have been allowed to lend up to the
hilt to the private sector. The measure
of this was that in the 11 months
up to the end of May the cheque-paying
banks combined lent more than 100
percent of their additions to deposits,
lifting these from $5325m. to $5659m.
and advances from $3155m. to $3495m.
In the second place, working on the
principle that advances generate further
deposits, the cheque-paying banks were
able to increase their total holdings
of Government securities (all kinds) by
$95m., despite a net reduction in their
holdings of Treasury notes over the
year. It was, of course, the banking
system’s build-up of Government
securities that came in so handy for the
Treasurer in reaching his loan-raising
target twice over last year. This enabled
him to cut the Budget deficit to half the
$270 million he budgeted for last
August.
As distinct from a minor contribution
by industrial investment (see later) to
the rise in private spending in both
1958-59 and 1966-67, in each of these
years there was a strong upturn in
actual industrial production which
helped to supplement private spending
power. On the other hand, the effect of
wage increases on outlays by industry,
and thus on the spending stream, was
minimal in 1958-59 compared with the
latest year.
In an article in the “Economic
Record” (1962), Professor Lydall in-
clined to the view that rising building
activity was one of the biggest influ-
ences contributing to mounting spend-
ing power in 1958-59. It is hardly any
less so this year, despite continued com-
plaints from various quarters that the
house-building rate isn’t as high -as it
should be. All categories of building
took a strong upturn in May, for which
the overall total of approvals was easily
a record.
THERE IS NO disputing Lydall’s view
that consumption was the leading ele-
ment in the sudden uprush in mid-
-1959, nor that this is the main force
in the present one. In both years hire-
purchase finance has been a “stretch-
ing” influence on spending power. If
support from this source looks to have
been relatively less marked in this up-
swing, it has still been quite substan-
tial.
Equally, both in 1958-59 and last
year, private fixed investment (unlike
public works in the two years) was
far from buoyant. In the former year
it increased at only a moderate rate,
whereas last year it fell away. In
neither of these years was private fixed
investment of key significance in the
rise in consumption in their second
halves. It is now history how income
generation from a sharp sustained rise
in private fixed investment took over
from the consumption impetus after
mid-1959 and, accelerating rapidly at
the beginning of 1960, reached a peak
in the September quarter of that year.
Perhaps the most leading question
just now is whether a similar sequence
of events is in prospect. It would not
surprise me to see a big rise in private
fixed investment in 1968. With the
Government’s expenditure snowballing
at the same time, monetary policy
would have to be very much more
restrictive in scope than it was in 1959-
60 to prevent another economic boil-
over.


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
How to deal in Euro-dollars
ONE OF THOSE JARGON words
that keeps popping up these days, even
on television, is “Euro-dollar.” Mr.
Wilson laid some of the blame for
sterling’s earlier troubles on the übiqui-
tous Euro-dollar market. And now,
following the upturn in short-term
interest rates on competitve dollar
investments in New York, it is in the
news again.
Yet this international money market
dates only from the autumn of 1957.
Restrictions then placed, as a result of
the Suez crisis, on ordinary sterling
credit facilities to finance non-British
trade set London’s adaptable bankers
the task of finding some alternative way
of meeting traders’ demands for credit.
Their answer was to tap the available
pool of dollars, the other great trading
currency, already held by residents out-
side the United States. Hence the
Euro-dollar, the appearance of a dollar
market in a European centre.
It was a modest beginning. But, in
the ten years since, the market has
grown beyond all recognition. It has
become a truly international market.
It no longer deals only in dollars, it is
a market in European currencies as
well, although its name hasn’t changed.
And other centres have begun to rival
London for the business. The network
of lenders and borrowers has widened
out. By the end of 1966 the market
had grown to some $l3 billion in net
assets to make it one of the world’s
largest markets for short-term funds.
It is also one of the freest, most
competitive, and flexible markets any-
where. It is a major factor to reckon
with in day-to-day management of
national monetary policies. Outside the
direct control of any national central
bank, the Euro-dollar market is a
powerful and extraordinarily sensitive
transmitter of pressures from one cur-
rency, or one national money market,
to another.
THE NAME “Euro-dollar” reflects
two basic characteristics. First,
while funds flow into the market from
40 to 50 countries throughout the
world, the principal dealers are banks
in European centres. These banks
“make” the market, acting as inter-
mediaries between ultimate lenders and
borrowers. They accept dollars and
other foreign currencies in the form of
time deposits (or more recently, in
some instances, against the issue of
negotiable certificates of deposit) and
then lend the funds on. The operating
banks are not necessarily European-
owned. American branch banks in Lon-
don are major dealers in the market.
But they are primarily European-based.
Second, while the market deals in
all of the world’s most important con-
vertible currencies, the dollar still pre-
dominates. Some four-fifths of the gross
foreign currency positions of banks in
the market at the end of 1966 were
dollar assets or liabilities. Sterling,
Swiss francs, Deutsche marks, French
francs, Dutch florins, and Italian lire
together made up the remaining fifth.
A key point is that transactions in
each currency take place outside the
country where that currency originates.
A dollar deposit in an American bank
becomes a Euro-dollar deposit when
title to it passes, say, from an Ameri-
can investor to a London bank, which
then puts the funds to work in Europe.
A sterling deposit in a British bank
becomes a Euro-sterling deposit when
title to it passes, say, from a British
importer to a bank in Paris. And so on.
Australia has already raised four Euro-
dollar loans. This article, from the London
"Economist," explains how dealings are
effected in Euro-dollars.
The market is a wholesale one in the
sense that it deals only in large amounts.
Transactions are often for $1 million
or more. Banks in the market lend on
the strength of the “name” of the other
banks and companies with which they
deal. Transactions between banks are
arranged over the telephone and are
unsecured. Dealers hedge their bets
largely by keeping a rein on their own
liquidity positions in the market and
by setting limits on the amount they
stand ready to lend to any one bank
or any one country. These limits are
adjusted as circumstances seem to
require. But it is one of the potential
weak points of the market, often criti-
cised, that because each individual bank
has only a hazy idea at best of how
much its rivals are lending anywhere
at any one time, together they can put
too many eggs in one basket.
Dealings are generally for short, fixed
periods. The bulk of transactions are
for three months or less. Although some
lending is done for two to three years
or occasionally even longer, there is an
important distinction between the Euro-
dollar market and its cousin, the Euro-
bond market. The first is a short-term
money market; the second, a long-term
capital market. Admittedly, in practice
the line between the two is often fuzzy.
But the bankers are right in insisting
that it is there.
Dealings are highly competitive. Be-
cause the sums of money involved are
usually large, the period of lending
short, the risks small, and the dealings
largely exempt from national restric-
tions, the Euro-dollar market operates
with very low costs and fine margins.
This means that operating banks can
pay out more to lenders and charge
less to borrowers than many domestic
money-market institutions and still
make a profitable turnover.
Until recently substantial Euro-
dollar funds were owned by American
residents. Some of the more sophisti-
cated American companies placed
funds directly in Europe; the bulk of
American funds, however, found their
way to Europe through Canadian
banks. But the enormous claw-back of
American funds that followed on Presi-
dent Johnson’s program of “voluntary”
restraints on capital movements has
completely changed the picture. Not
only have company funds been repatri-
ated, European branches of American
banks have actively bid for additional
Euro-dollars and funnelled them back
to their head offices in New York.
The most important single use for
Euro-dollars is still the financing of
foreign trade. Since the bulk of this
trade is invoiced in, and must be paid
for in, the major convertible currencies,
importers have found it useful to
borrow Euro-currencies when this was
cheaper or easier than borrowing their
own domestic currencies. Similarly,
exporters have often found it cheaper
to finance the period between shipment
of their goods and payment for these
goods by borrowing in the Euro-dollar
market. However, Euro-currencies are
also borrowed to finance operations or
stocks of businesses not directly engaged
in international trade, or to carry por-
tions of new security issues.
THE ENORMOUS growth of the
Euro-dollar market has had a profound
impact on the banks themselves, pro-
moting both greater competition and
the spread of links between banks in
different countries. The recent creation
of the International Commercial Bank
Ltd. jointly by the Westminster Bank
Ltd., the Hong Kong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation, Commerzbank
AG, Irving Trust Co., and the First
National City Bank of Chicago is only
the latest instance of broader links.
All this has made domestic money mar-
ket management more difficult. This
aspect has not always been welcomed
by hard-pressed central banks.
Nonetheless, in some important re-
spects the market has also strengthened
the world’s liquidity system. Most ex-
perts would argue that it has at least
temporarily strengthened the position
of the dollar by making it more profit-
able to use and hold dollars. And, in-
telligently manipulated, the market has
on occasion directly eased the financing
of payments surpluses and deficits.


Countries need an income, too.
Exports help to provide it. Electrolytic
Zinc Company’s exports play an
important role in providing Aus-
tralia’s income. Zinc exports to the
United Kingdom, Thailand, Hong
Kong, India, to over thirty different
countries, earned 25 million dollars
for Australia in 1965/66. That's in-
come enough to pay for nearly all
the tea we imported, or cars, or
tobacco. It’s a lot of income for
Australia, earned by EZ’s enterprise
and the quality of their product and
service.

SPECULATOR’S
DIARY
Selling just like
the Yankee
"swinger" funds
“SIT DOWN, you’re rocking the
economy,” investment advisers in the
U.S.A. were told the other day. The
message didn’t get through. The boys
were too busy making profits from their
new, and very voguey, toy the
“swinger” funds. These funds are big-
ger than Hot-line and are having a
really hip effect on the Yankee invest-
ment scene. The “swinger” funds swing
into a stock, hold it a short time, and
then swing out again. In the interim,
profits (and supposedly sometimes
losses) are made on the price variations.
The effect of this volume buying and
selling on prices is chaotic, and the
old hands are worried.
In Australia no such problem exists.
Our institutions are more conserva-
tive. Unfortunately, so are their profits.
Out here, when our institutional fathers
buy stock, it stays bought. That goes
regardless of whether the stock is
Factors, BHP, or Oodnadatta Gas
Works. No discrimination here. But
don’t think I’m for the American sys-
tem —I’m not. It would collapse our
little market quicker than the w r aves
collapsed Surfers Paradise beach. What
I would like to see, however, and I am
sure many unit trust holders and people
in superannuation funds would agree,
is our local investment managers doing
a lot more trading and a lot less hatch-
ing. Common sense alone dictates that
investment decisions be continually re-
viewed in the light of changing con-
ditions and current facts.
A good stock to be trading in at
the moment is Patersons, the furnishing
people. The company is an old Nathan
family concern, which has its origins
back in 1884. The current chairman
and managing director is Sir Maurice
Nathan, who was at one time the Lord
Mayor of Melbourne. Over 70 retail
stores are now operated by the group.
Last year the company earned $526,000,
which represented an earning rate of
7.1 percent on capital. The report for
the first half of this year was that sales
were up, costs were up, and profit was
lower. The interim dividend w ? as cut
from three cents to 2.5 cents per share
for “conservative” reasons.
Despite this discouraging news I
still think the shares are selling at
bargain-basement levels. Prices are
currently about half the values earlier
this year. It is not too often you can
buy companies listed on the Exchange
which are making profits, paying divi-
dends, and which have a market price
less than 28 percent of their asset back-
ing. On these grounds this company
looks ripe for a takeover offer, if only
for the real estate involved. AIL this
was enough to convince me. I bought
500 at 32 cents. I noticed I wasn’t the
only one who saw the possibilities.
Trading on the home exchange of Mel-
bourne over the past week has been
rather brisk.
Angus & Robertson, the well-
known Sydney booksellers and pub-
lishers, also look good to me at current
prices. The Macquarie University in
Sydney, which kicked off earlier in the
year, and the added year New South
Wales schoolchildren are now spending
in high school, should both have boosted
profits for the 1966-67 year. Also, the
company will increase its profits as a
result of its contract to publish “News-
week” magazine in Australia. At $1.30,
the shares offer scope for some reason-
able profits over the period of the next
few months.
This week, like the department stores,
I had my winter sale. Out went Bell
Bros. (Holdings), Dwyers, and Aus-
tralian National Industries. All three
stocks were traded in the best “swinger”
fund tradition and, luckily, all earned
profits. Total profit from the three
ventures, after paying brokerage, was
a modest, but nevertheless welcome,
$6l.

Don’t be so quick to believe
all those peaks
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON
IT MIGHT LOOK like the good old
days in the stockmarket again, but
don’t believe it. The stockmarket as a
whole is nowhere near the peak level
of 1964 that the Sydney share price
index says it is. Take out BHP and
the index would lose most of its present
lustre and then take out the mining
stocks and you would see how dull the
investment scene really is.
The worst thing about the mining
and oil boom that is making so much
money for speculators in that section of
the market is that it probably is giving
those Budget planners in Canberra quite
the wrong impression about the invest-
ment situation; unfortunately the Can-
berra men think that stockmarket booms
cause inflation. More so, there is the
disastrous possibility that the Budget
planners may decide that some sort of
action is needed to hold back a stock-
market boom yet it doesn’t really
exist outside oil-gas and mining, and it
would be reckless to try to discourage
investment interest in this area.
Have a look at the first 50 stocks in
the Sydney share list and you’ll get a
fair idea of how dull the investment
market really is. Of these 50, 26 are
nearer their lowest point for the year
than their highest. And 15 of these are
at, or very near, their lowest point for
the year. These are not just rubbish
stocks, either. Companies like ACF-
Shirleys, ARC, Anderson’s Seeds, and
Australian Chemical Holdings are near
their worst price for the yeai.
Of course, there are some that are
doing very well but not many. Only
seven of the first 50 on the list are at
or near their best prices for the year,
And four of these are the sort of market
heavyweights that have been the only
shares to have shown any real improve-
ment this year. These are APA, Associ-
ated Securities (helped along by another
excellent result), ANZ Bank, and ACI.
The moral in all this is not simply
that the planners in Canberra should
not be misled by a non-existent invest-
ment boom. It is that improved results
from many companies when they make
their profit announcements in the next
month or two could bring some real
price increases and there is plenty
of room for improvement in the prices
of most of the shares on the list. Right
now is the time to go back and have
a look at those interim reports of a
few months ago. For there is a chance
that profits made on the mining post
may find their way into the investment
market if things look like picking up.
Get in first. There is no doubt that
a great many investors are out of the
investment market at the moment and
are playing the mining field for all it
is worth. Sooner or later they will be
coming back, once the mining boom
eases up a bit. And when they do there
will presumably be some healthy in-
crease in the present very dull demand
for industrial equities and there is
no doubt some chance that the usual
flush liquidity period of the year that
is soon to come will bring its usual
lift to stockmarket activity.
One example of this sort of invest-
ment switch from industrials into min-
ing is the activity of the Melbourne
investment counsellor Graeme Moir,
whose mutual fund is currently invested
more than 80 percent in mining and
oil and less than 20 percent in indus-
trials, and that is after classifying BHP
in its proper place as a mining stock.
Moir’s biggest mining investment is in
Western Mining. The industrial stocks
that still appeal to Moir, despite the
attractions of oil and mining, are all
small- to medium-sized companies
whose prospects of improved market
status seem very high. Some of these 16
companies, like Automatic Totalisa-
tors, Eglo Engineering, and Protector
Safety Industries, have been discussed
favorably in The Bulletin in recent
times. But Moir also includes such
cheap recovery prospects as Advance
Industries, Clark Rubber, Davleco,
Elmaco, Fowlers Vacola, and Pongrass.
Others in his list are Coventry, Equity
Trustees, Frozen Food, Macquarie
Broadcasting, Valentine, and Wood-
masons.
The Chartist says:
GOLD MINES OF KALGOORLIE was recommended at about $1.15 in December,
1966, as it then showed promise of a move up to about the $1.55 level. However,
the uptrend broke toward the end of January this year and prices fell as low as
80c, but quickly reversed to make a high of $1.65 recently. In view of the recent
market action and also in relation to its long-term trend, the stock can now be
reassessed. The overall picture since 1961 could be likened to Western Mining
before its spectacular rise and the upward move to $1.65 in Gold Mines of
Kalgoorlie, which occurred on very high volume, could now be classified as a
breakout from the large consolidation pattern formed over a number of years. It
is quite likely that prices could move up to between $2.80 and $3.00 in the short
to medium term, with the possibility of much higher targets. At this point, however,
the stock would need to be reassessed in terms of future probable trend development.
Any rise to $1.40 on high volume would be promising for a continuation of the
uptrend. Last sale price on 17/7/67 —$1.20.

The Melbourne Market
A worthy electrical retailer
WINNERS IN THE field of electrical
retailing have always been hard to
pick in the market, and for this reason
most have been largely disregarded.
However, Vox Adeon Howard Hold-
ings Ltd., which operates in Western
Australia and to a lesser extent in
South Australia, seems to have been
overlooked more because of lack of
publicity than anything else. Through
shortage of knowledge, the market has
slid this stock into the “no action” price
bracket, where, currently selling near a
year low, the dividend yield is better
than nine percent.
The company’s performance in the
past five years has been better than
most. Profits have more than quad-
rupled and earning rate on steadily
rising capital has been kept at levels
which give a three or four times cover
to the rising dividend.
The most remarkable feature of the
group’s performance is that not only
do dividends increase as the capacity to
pay them rises but every time earning
rate reaches the current high levels a
bonus issue is made. After 1962-63,
when earning rate was 30 percent, a
one-for-five bonus was made. This was
followed after 1964-65 by a 3-for-20
bonus, when earning rate was 40 per-
cent. A year later, earning rate slipped
to 35 percent, on peak profit.
Directors expect profit for the year
just finished to eclipse all records. Their
interim report noted generally increased
sales, marked uptrends in small appli-
ances and records, above-budget, sales
for the wholesale division, tax loss
benefits from a recently acquired sub-
sidiary, and “a substantial increase in
the return from one major invest-
ment.” With directors’ tones as con-
fident as this, it is easy to visualise an
earning rate for 1966-67 well in excess
of 40 percent. On past performance,
then, the group seems sure to announce
a bonus issue and/or dividend lift
when the profit figures are released
late in August. In the meantime, the
nine percent yield from a thrice-covered
dividend is not to be sneezed at. Present
price is 55 cents; the 1966 high was
$1.60.
THE 50 CENT SHARES of Bowling
Centres (Holdings) Ltd. have been
foundering well below par for four
years now. Considering group perform-
ance in that period it is not surprising.
Unlike other ten-pin bowling com-
panies, however, the current low share
price seems unusually pessimistic after
a look at the operational changes which
have taken place within the group.
Its 15 bowling centres have been
leased to American Machine and
Foundry Co. (Australia) Pty. Ltd. for
three years, with an option of a further
two years. Under terms of the rental
agreement, BCH must make a profit
after depreciation. The rents are worked
out on a minimum basis, and are
increased each year. To BCH this
means bowling losses are impossible; it
can write down bowling plant which
has no other use, and at the end of
the leasing period it can take over a
successful business.
The second major point in the com-
pany’s favor is that its subsidiary,
Auto-Coin Drycleaning Pty. Ltd.,
earned a profit after tax of about
$lB,OOO last year. Because of BCH’s
previous heavy commitments in bowl-
ing, expansion of this offshoot was
hampered. Directors promised last De-
cember to expand the business if con-
ditions prove favorable, and this
rapidly expanding field of coin-in-the-
slot laundering will prove lucrative.
Apart from leasing 15 centres to
AM&F, BCH has disposed of its other
bowling interests.
After these changes in operations,
group profit fell from $45,600 to
$23,000 in the December half-year. The
figure excluded a share of excess re-
ceipts (which will be included in the
annual result), and was after writing
off costs of leasing arrangements. The
accumulation of cash from the sale of
Kensington, the writing-down of plant,
and the surplus from leasing have
placed BCH in a situation where it
must decide what to do with its liquid
funds. It has no immediate future in
bowling, but it can expand its Auto-
Coin subsidiary. Or it can return some
capital, which would leave it better
placed, in the long run, to pay a divi-
dend. Net assets backing for each 50
cent share is 44 cents after excluding
intangibles a far cry from the 10
cents the scrip is at present fetching.

Security analysis
Benefits to come from
Mt. Isa’s expansion
IN THE RUSH BY investors to buy
leading mineral stocks, Mt. Isa Mines
Ltd.’s shares appear to have been over-
looked. Although, at the height of the
crippling strike in 1965, Mt. Isa’s share
price did not fall below $3.00, indicat-
ing investors’ faith in the long-term
future of the company, at present the
share price is only around $3.70, hav-
ing risen to $4.85 in the interim. In
the light of the very substantial dis-
counting of the future being accorded
many leading mining companies in the
context of the present buoyant mining
market, it would appear that investor
confidence in Mt. Isa’s future has been
shaken somewhat. Yet it would appear
that Mt. Isa’s long-term outlook has
never been better than at present.
In the other articles in this series I
have emphasised the individual com-
panies’ exploration interests and their
respective “successes” to date. As from
January, 1961, Mt. Isa’s exploration
activities (outside of its leases at Mt.
Isa) have been carried out by its
subsidiary, Carpentaria Exploration Co.
Pty. Ltd. In 1965-66, out of a total
“prospecting and exploration expenses”
of $1,573,524, over $BOO,OOO was in-
curred by Carpentaria Exploration.
This subsidiary’s exploration efforts
have been concentrated in the Northern
Territory and in Queensland and have
centred on the MacArthur River area
near Borroloola in the Northern Terri-
tory (380 miles north-west of Mt. Isa).
Existence of mineralisation has been
known at MacArthur River since the
1880 s. The Zinc Corporation, which
had taken up a prospecting authority
in 1952, subsequently let it lapse. Mt.
Isa’s intensive prospecting in the area
commenced in 1955. To date over $3
million has been spent by Mt. Isa at
MacArthur River, including $600,000
on a permanent base camp.
Although this discovery has not re-
ceived much publicity, it is acknow-
ledged as being probably the largest
low-grade lead/zinc orebody in the
world. No indication has yet been
given of likely grades. The deposits
range in depth from 100 ft. to 1950 ft.
in places. Open-cut mining on a large
scale (at least on a scale comparable to
the projected throughput at Mt. Isa’s
mine) is to be the initial plan, with
underground mining at a later date.
Ultimate development of this deposit
is expected to cost around $2OO million.
Because of the location of the deposits,
two towns, a port, road or rail and
air communications will need to be
established as well as the plant and
many specialised pieces of equipment to
mine and treat the ore.
Mt. Isa has emphasised the metal-
lurgical problems associated with the
MacArthur River ore. As the ore is
fine-grained, this will involve fine crush-
ing, which will make it difficult to
achieve high recovery rates. So far,
considerable research effort has been
devoted to improving the economics
of this venture. At least one source,
however, is confident that the Mac-
Arthur river deposit can be equipped
for “first level” production in 1972,
and “second level” production in
1976-77. Moreover, the latest publica-
tion on the minerals industry by a
well-known firm of Melbourne stock-
brokers implicitly makes some quan-
titative “guesstimate” of the likely metal
output from this deposit in its fore-
casts of Australian silver/lead/zinc
production in the 1966-82 period.
Relevant extracts are as follows:
ESTIMATED AUSTRALIAN MINE PRODUCTION
1971 1972 1973 1974 1975 1976 1977
Silver
i( million

Zinc ('OOO
tons) 420 520 640 640 640 750 870
The large increases that occur in
these figures in 1972-73 and 1976-77 are
presumably mainly due to the influence
of the MacArthur River deposits.
Whilst these figures could point an
unduly optimistic picture of the poten-
tial of these deposits, it would appear
that in ten years’ time Mt. Isa’s profits
from this source could approximate
those currently being earned at the
Mt. Isa mine. At this stage, though,
this proposition must be regarded as
being extremely tentative.
So far as Mt. Isa’s current opera-
tions are concerned, there is little doubt
that the production problems ex-

(b) In 1965/66 copper ore treated included 658,908
tons from the oipen cut assaying 4.4%. Copper
oipen cut operations have since ceased. The
grade of underground cbpper ore treated in
1965/66 was 2.77,.
Whilst the company had hoped to
increase ore treatment rate from 11,000
tons to 16,000 tons per day by late
1967, following the near completion
in mid-1966 of its new K 57 shaft and
ancillary equipment, delays have
occurred in the installation of under-
ground crushing equipment and the
company encountered difficult ground
in the 1966-67 year which further de-
layed progress (and which caused
copper ore grade to slump to around
1.9 percent). Reflecting these difficul-
ties, Mt. Isa’s 1966-67 production report
revealed a 31.3 percent drop in blister
copper output despite an oil percent
increase in copper ore treated.
It would now seem that the first
full year’s benefit of the K 57 shaft will
not occur before 1969-70. Undoubtedly,
this has disappointed many potential
investors. However, it should be remem-
bered that once this higher level of
production is attained, the company
will be in a much better position to
increase production even further.
Those investors who follow the “buy
in gloom” principle should await Mt.
Isa’s likely disappointing profit an-
nouncement for 1966-67 for a favorable
entry price. I would consider that they
will prosper handsomely in the long
run, since it is only a matter of time
before substantial benefits flow from
the Mt. Isa expansion program, whilst
the outlook is highly promising for the
exploitation of the MacArthur River
deposits.

MANUFACTURING DRILLS BY THE UNIQUE ROLL
FORGING PROCESS involves electronically-controlled
machines which magazine-feed each drill blank into a
high-frequency induction coil, where it immediately heats
to forging temperature in the range of 2,120 F. Blank
then advances between two sets of rollers which, with a
single revolution, form the flutes and relief. Extruded
blank is subsequently cut to length, centreless ground,
heat-treated, surface-treated, and automatically precision
pointed. As the result of roll forging, the granular structure
of the high speed steel used, follows the contour of the
cutting edge. No interrupted end-to-end grain where
flutes have been milled or ground out as with the
conventional method. Result a twist drill with roll
forged strength throughout! Made exclusively by P&N
And it’s not surprising considering
we're turning them out by the million
to keep ahead of your demands.

The quest for sulphur supplies
IN THE MARCH issue, just released,
of the Bureau of Mineral Resources’
Quarterly Review of the Australian
Mineral Industry, the commentator,
Mr. Z. Kalix, remarks that there seems
a reasonable chance of discovering
deposits of elemental sulphur in Aus-
tralia, and that it would be remark-
able indeed if no sour (i.e., sulphur-
containing) gas were found as a result
of the activities of oil exploration com-
panies. Considering the discoveries
made in Australia in the past few years
of metals and minerals not previously
known to exist in commercial quanti-
ties oil, nickel, phosphate are prime
examples discovery of elemental
sulphur deposits of a good size does not
appear to be too much to hope for.
Even so, projects such as Broken
Hill South’s development of its vast
phosphate deposit in Queensland
would probably stand a chance of being
accelerated if there were local sources
of cheap sulphur from which the sul-
phuric acid necessary for the production
of superphosphate could be obtained.
With the increasing pressure on fer-
tiliser production caused by expanding
world food requirements and the econ-
omics of pasture improvement, there is,
too, the question of price. As time goes
on, prices will have to rise even more
to make attractive the extraction of
higher-cost sulphur-bearing minerals
such as pyrites. Price rises in recent
years have certainly encouraged the
search for new deposits of elemental
sulphur, as well as justifying additional
investment in sulphur recovery plants
on oilfields, gasfields, and in metal-
smelting plants. In December, 1964,
elemental sulphur was selling at
$U.5.27 per ton; in February, 1965, the
price rose to SU.S.3I; and a year later,
in March, 1966, rose to between
$U.5.45 and SU.S.SO per ton.
A further rise occurred in January
this year, when the price of Mexican
sulphur was increased to the American
level. Thus, in the past 2j years, the
price has moved up some 66-86 per-
cent. Considerable as this rise has been,
it has meant that supply will only just
meet demand in 1967.
Mr. Kalix goes on to say that sulphur
production projects now under con-
struction, or already announced, do
not seem to add up to sufficient capa-
city to supply future demand if usage
continues to grow at the rate experi-
enced in the past four years. To make
available additional supplies, recourse
will have to be made to more costly
deposits than those being exploited at
present; hence higher prices must be
expected in order to cover the higher
costs as well as the additional invest-
ments required.
Australia is reasonably fortunate in
that its large base-metal mining industry
produces considerable quantities of sul-
phur-contammg by-products m the form
of the pyrites (iron sulphide) obtained
from the smelting of lead, zinc, and
copper concentrates. A useful portion
also comes from sulphur recovery units
at oil refineries. In all, domestic
materials make up about 40 percent of
Australian sulphuric acid production.
Growth in demand for sulphuric acid
has led to the installation of more
facilities for the utilisation of the sul-
phur content of mineral, but the con-
tinuing increase in demand will

Painful
Hemorrhoids
It strikes 7 out of every 10 people in
all walks of life. Yet many otherwise
intelligent people know little of its dan-
gers. Piles (hemorrhoids) are aggra-
vated by many factors—including
over-exertion and unsuitable diet.
Neglect—and reliance on superficial
relief—invites serious medical conse-
quences. Eight years’ Swiss research
developed Varemoid Tablets —now
regarded by overseas specialists as the
leading anti-inflammatory treatment
for piles. Remarkable improvement is
being achieved —even with sufferers
of over 20 years. A week’s course

probably outstrip local capacity in the
fairly near future.
Further increases in the price of ele-
mental sulphur imports could also mean
that other local sources, hitherto un-
economic, would become attractive.
The slimes dumps of the Mount Mor-
gan copper/gold mine contain vast
amounts of pyrites which could be
commercially useful at a certain price
level. This company has investigated
the possibility of either exporting this
supply or using it in a fertiliser plant
at Gladstone, in conjunction with the
W. R. Grace organisation of America.
So far neither of these has come to
fruition; with each rise in the price of
imported sulphur, the proposition
becomes a little more attractive.
When the extraction of Broken Hill
South’s huge phosphate deposits near
Mount Isa begins, it may become feas-
ible to construct a sulphuric acid plant
at Mount Isa (which would utilise the
sulphur content of lead smelter gases
now wasted) and produce superphos-
phate nearby. At present, sulphur prices
would have to rise a lot more for this
to be likely, as Queensland uses only
a very small proportion of the total
Australian production of superphos-
phate, and transport costs would be an
over-riding consideration.
The only company which produces
pyritic sulphur on its own is Norse-
man Gold Mines NL. The company
ceased mining gold in 1947, when the
grade of ore treated fell to 2.6 dwt. per
ton, and since that time has built up
an operation which produces concen-
trated pyrites which it sells for the
sulphur content. Norseman has found
the bounty paid on sulphuric acid pro-
duced from pyrites quite an assistance,
for it has had difficulty in finding
buyers for possible increases in pro-
duction, which would allow a reduction
in costs. The shortage of elemental
sulphur and higher prices in recent
years have rectified this situation some-
what. From the 17,046 tons of con-
tained sulphur produced in 1964, worth
$589,092, production in the year to
October, 1966, rose to 23,213 tons of
contained sulphur, worth $763,694.
These figures show that the company
has had to sell at lower prices in order
to achieve the production increase.
Nevertheless, the higher volume had its
desired effect on costs, as profit in 1966
was $72,351 against the $45,250 earned
in 1964. In the current year to date
Norseman has benefited from both
higher production as well as higher
revenue per ton, and this year’s profit
should show a good rise. Next year the
company will have had the benefit of
higher prices for a full year and profits
should be even better.
The operation of the bounty on
sulphuric acid produced from pyrites
extends to 1969. Last year this bounty
was reduced by $1 per ton (of acid)
to take account of higher prices for
imported elemental sulphur, and any
further rise will no doubt mean further
reductions. Although this bounty re-
duction may make Norseman’s product
less attractive to acid and superphos-
phate producers, the company should be
able to maintain competitive prices
due to higher production. There is, too,
the possibility that the bounty would
be increased in the event that overseas
sulphur prices continue to rise at the
rates of the past few years.
Commodities
Price declines for
iron ore
PRESSURE ON THE iron ore market
from new high-grade sources in Aus-
tralia and Brazil is expected to see
further price falls in coming years. The
Svenska Handelsbanken, of Stockholm
(Sweden supplies about 5 percent of
world production), analyses the iron
ore market in a recent report. Prices of
iron ore on the world market have
fallen by 8 to 10 percent in the past
five years, the bank says. As additional
supplies of high-grade ores and pellets
become available, a further decline in
values is likely. Low-grade and medium-
grade ores will lose markets.
The review says that the decade to
1966 saw a 60 percent growth in ingot
steel output and an equally large rise
in iron ore production on an iron-
content basis. Since 1964, however, the
steel market has slowed last year
output lifted only three percent on
average, including a one percent fall in
the Common Market. The slow-down
in ore use has thrown out suppliers’
calculations and increased competition
in the international market.
France and West Germany, having
relatively low-grade ores, were first to

feel the pinch, while the U.K. and
Sweden have also been affected. In
France the Fourth Plan predicted a 20
percent lift in iron ore production
between 1960 and 1965; in the event,
output fell 11 percent. In the same
period, West German iron ore output
dropped more than 40 percent to 8
million tons.
The Common Market imported 60
percent of its ore in 1965, against. 40
percent in 1960. In the five years, U.K.
ore production fell 10 percent to 16
million tons, and about half of 1965
ingot production was from imported
materials.
All this has been achieved before
Australia, currently the fastest-
developing new source, had begun
exporting. Venezuela, which in 1960
was the largest overseas supplier to
Europe, had been surpassed by Liberia,
Brazil, and Mauritania by 1965. In
1965 Brazil and Liberia together ex-
ported nearly as much to Europe as
Sweden, against only one quarter as
much in 1960.
At present the two sources attracting
most attention are Brazil and Australia.
Brazil’s State-owned operator, CVRD,
exported 10 million tons in 1965 and
plans to double this by 1970. Also, U.S.
interests have sponsored a new company;
Brazil expected to be exporting 5 mil-
lion tons a year in a few years’ time.
During coming years new mines will be
opened in Angola and Canada. The
world’s biggest producer of iron ore,
Russia, is believed to plan exports out-
side the Communist nations.
Increased supplies of scrap iron are
not expected to have much impact on
markets, the bank says, because of the
need for a stable “feed” in steel manu-
facture. However, this may depend on
ore prices.
Latest forecasts on steel production
indicate a less optimistic outlook. The
European Coal and Steel Community
has predicted 2 percent annual growth
in 1966-70 against 3.5 percent in
1960-65. The ECSC believes 1970 ore
imports by the U.S., Japan, Britain, and
the Common Market will total 171
million tons. Available supplies are ex-
pected to hit 200-odd million tons. The
excess is expected to gradually decrease,
with balance not being reached until
1975 at the earliest.
THE PUNDITS said the silver mar-
ket was in for a period of wide fluctua-
tions when the U.S. Treasury banned
the export of silver from its stocks
two months ago. And this goes double
now that the Government has gone
all the way and eliminated entirely the
fixed selling price of $1.29 an ounce.
This level had been held to safeguard
U.S. coinage from being melted down.
Now that there is about enough of the
new silver-free or low-silver coinage in
circulation, it is not so important to
protect the older silver coins. All this
is much as forecast. And now, accord-
ing to the forecast, free market silver
prices should settle down at $1.40 or
so an ounce, at which level old coins
can be purchased and profitably
smelted down.
But speculation has boosted U.S.
free markets to around 190 cents an
ounce and the London market to over
13/6 an ounce (a peak, against 9/3
held for more than four years until
the mid-May U.S. export limitations).
It is extremely unlikely that the
silver market is held at its present
levels by anything more substantial
than speculators’ juggling. On present
evidence, there seems little chance that
silver prices will be much above
$U.5.1.40 an ounce in six months’ time.
There is, nevertheless, an element of
doubt, in that hoarders may attempt to
hold the silver coins in hopes of bigger
profits later.
Certainly, the higher prices come at
an opportune time for local lead-zinc-
silver miners, who face declining prices
for their other products. Mt. Isa Mines,
which is passing through a period of
poor output as well as generally fall-
ing prices, will be the main bene-
ficiary, with its production of about
6 million ounces a year.

AND STATISTICS
The paramount influence of BHP and the base metals has
pushed the Sydney “all ordinaries” index to a record level, sur-
passing its best position of some years ago; this situation
should not be allowed to conceal considerable unevenness
among the body of industrials. Hills put on a net 44 cents to
stand at $lO.OO, after touching $10.15 at one stage in Mel-
bourne. All the Barriers moved ahead once more, the respective
additions being: B. H. South, 15 cents; North B. H., 41 cents-
New B. H., 88 cents; and CRA, 70 cents. Hamersley rose 58
cents to $6.30, and CGA 62 cents to $5.42.

No wonder he’s the family favourite. Clean warm
air circulating in every room throughout the
coldest periods of the year. No huddling around
ineffective one-room heaters!
No frigid early morning toes! Instead, the won-
derful feeling of being able to wear summertime
clothes throughout your home every day of the
year—and with simple, finger-tip control!
Low fuel costs, too, and all fully automatic,
even the economical oil burner—that’s what
Gilbarco.Central “Whole House” Heating means
in the successful man’s home. You can get all
this for little more than the cost of heating
two or three rooms with “huddle-over” heating!
Two systems from which to choose: The popular
Hot Water Central Heating system incorporating
The Potterton Boiler unit, which supplies
throughout-the-home heat with a complete hot
water service: or a fully ducted warm air system
in which air is fan-circulated from a Gilbarco
Warm Air Furnace.
Both heating units are compact enough to place
in the garage, laundry, basement or even under
the house.

Always a
jump ahead
Rank Xerox. A jump ahead in every sphere of graphic communications
A lump ahead off
obsolescence
You don't buy Rank Xerox
machines, you rent them. You
never have your money tied up in
a machine that will be obsolescent.
As you know, the field of graphic
communications is one where spec-
tacular advances are being made
every few months. When a new
machine comes into being and
you need it. Rank Xerox takes
away the old and installs the new.
A jump ahead off
salesmen
Rank Xerox have no salesmen,
only communications specialists.
That doesn’t mean just a high
falutin’ salesman. It means a man
with special qualifications in the
field of business management. A
man who talks your language; who
knows how to cut costs; increase
profit margins by speeding the
method and flow of accurate
communications, within your
business and to business associates.
A jump ahead in
accuracy
Rank Xerox machines copy any-
thing, any colour, onto bond
paper, in clear black and white.
Ball point pen, light pencil
corrections, come out exact. Three-
dimensional objects, too, like pages
from books, like fingerprints. In
fact, xerocopies are so accurate
they are the only machine copies
accepted legally as originals.
A jump ahead in
convenience
No masters necessary. No messy
inks. No special operators. No
time wasted.
A jump ahead in
savings
Increased productivity makes
money, saves money. Productivity
is stepped up by the immediacy of
shared information. No typing up
masters. No chance of transcription
errors. No time wasted sending
work out. A jump ahead in
efficiency that puts you a jump
ahead in savings.
A jump ahead in
model range
Right now, Rank Xerox can show
you a range of copying equipment,
each one handling different
volumes of work. One that could
help put your business a jump
ahead of competitors. There are
some pretty big surprises coming
up during '67 which we can’t let
out of the hag just now. But if
you’re already a Rank Xerox
renter, you’ll be first to hear
about them.
A jump ahead in
research
The Xerox research and develop-
ment programme for 1967 is, in
round figures, $5O million. Rank
Xerox is committed to this
programme of research and
development. We are dealing not
only with the present, but laying
the foundations for future growth
and continuous expansion. Our way
of ensuring Rank Xerox will con-
tinue to be always a jump ahead.
For further information about
specific equipment advances, please
don't hesitate to ring us.

THE LAND
The egg plan in disarray
By the RURAL EDITOR
THE EGG WAR in Victoria between
the Egg Board and the Free Traders
has taken an ugly turn. The Board
says that second-grade Board eggs
have been restamped as first-grade
and sold to the public. These eggs are
said to be misshapen, cracked, and
have blood spots. Normally they are
sold to go into cake mixes and for
pulping, etc.
The Board says that genuine first-
grade Board eggs are being discredited
because of the sale of these second-
grade eggs bearing a counterfeit stamp.
But Board chairman, Mr. R. W. Free-
man, goes further. In a prepared state-
ment he said: “Certain links between
persons involved and organisations
handling interstate eggs have already
been established, and investigations are
continuing. The matter has been re-
ferred to the Board’s legal advisers and
the police have been called in to
determine whether legal action for
conspiracy to defeat the provisions of
the Marketing of Primary Products
Act or other action can be taken.”
Without naming them, Freeman has
sown in the mind of the public at
large the thought that the Free Traders’
organisation is involved in the re-
stamping of eggs purchased from the
Board. If the charge is true it is a
grave reflection on the ethics of the
Free Traders’ organisation. If it is not
true it is just as grave a reflection on
the ethics of the Board. The Free
Traders’ secretary, Mr. J. F. Robinson,
has described the incident as “just
another Egg Board red herring.”
What may come out of this is yet
another Royal Commission into the
egg industry. The grave charge should
be pursued until the public knows
all the facts, and the only body capable
of doing this is the State Government.
The investigation could go beyond the
counterfeiting of Egg Board stamps.
The Council of Egg Marketing
Authorities’ plan (the spark which set
the “war” off) runs into more trouble
as every week goes by. In Victoria a
number of leading producers have
stopped payment of the CEMA hen
tax pending a court challenge. In South
Australia poultry farmers have held
protest meetings and have decided to
petition the Labor Government there
for a State referendum of poultry far-
mers. Anti-CEMA spokesmen say that
if they get the referendum there is no
doubt that farmers will reject it. In
Tasmania there is a similar move for
a referendum.
Licensing of farmers seems out of the
question, following the Australian Agri-
cultural Council meeting in Darwin.
Most of the supporters of the Board’s
and the CEMA plan favor licensing.
The Free Traders are against it.
In Darwin the Minister for Primary
Industry, Mr. Adermann, said: “The
Council discussed a- broad proposal put
forward by certain industry bodies that
the upward trend in production should
be held in check by a licensing system.
It was generally agreed that price
adjustments to producers and consumers
were a more suitable means of check-
ing production, and that CEMA should
do this rather than the adoption of a
licensing system.”
The Minister added that it was the
practice of the Australian Agricultural
Council to give consideration to any
proposal which might have general
industry acceptance. However, the licen-
sing proposal was of a very broad nature
and there appeared to be a “degree
of division” within the industry on it.
The Council decided that commercial
egg producers should be warned against
increasing the size of their flocks in
the face of the current upward trend
in production and low export prices.
The Council considered that unless this
advice was taken throughout the
industry, the basic objectives of the
CEMA plan, i.e., ensuring reasonable
returns to producers and sharing the
cost of disposing of surpluses, could
be “jeopardised.”
All this is, of course, understatement
of the kind to be expected from a body
meeting in Darwin, of all places, to
discuss important matters in Australian
agriculture generally. “Degree of
division” (over licensing) hardly de-
scribes the current position. If the
Commonwealth Government was to
bring in licensing there would be open
anarchy. Likewise the CEMA plan
could hardly be termed to be in
“jeopardy” when, in fact, it is in dis»
array now.

New products from Australian dairies
PEACE APART, PROTEIN is prob-
ably the world’s most pressing need
today. Indeed, peace may be impos-
sible until the problem of supplying
people everywhere with sufficient high-
grade food is overcome. By changing
its present pattern of food production,
the dairying industry can contribute in
Packing Mali brand milk at Bangkok
no small way to the resolution of these
interrelated problems—and some of its
own problems to boot. New products
and new markets are beginning to b&
explored, both here and abroad, and
already some trends in local produc-
tion figures are evident.
The output of non-fat milk foods
from our dairy factories has been
growing steadily. Thus, within the
past decade, the volume of skim-milk
powder and casein has about doubled.
During this current year the produc-
tion of skim-milk powder is rising par-
ticularly sharply. If the trend con-
tinues, by the year’s end 100,000 tons
will be available for the tables of the
human family. Much will go to Asia,
where it is most needed and where
the Australian Dairy Produce Board has
got three large plants operating to
produce sweetened condensed milk.
These factories, at Bangkok, Singapore,
and Manila, take dried milk solids and
butter oil from us and recombine them
using a CSIRO method to make the
sweetened condensed milk.
Nevertheless, butter manufacture
continues to dominate our dairying
industry to an overywhelming degree.

WATER and LAND
TWO CASE STUDIES
IN IRRIGATION
Throughout the world there is a continuous and growing
demand for government-implemented water conservation
schemes. In Australia, the largest and oldest of these the
Murray-Murrumbidgee system on the Riverina Plain and
adjoining mallee lowland, shows engineering skill and in-
genuity, and some agronomic advance, but have sociological
and economic considerations been neglected or ignored?
In the first part of this book, Professor Langford-Smith
examines in detail the M.1.A.; in the second Professor Ruther-
ford considers the integration of irrigation and dryland farm-
ing, with particular reference to the Murray-Murrumbidgee
systems.
A book for students, farmers, economists, engineers, and
everyone interested in the effective and efficient use of
water and land.
AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY PRESS
P.O. BOX 4, CANBERRA, A.C.T.
raped annually for its fat alone. As
a consequence, about 400 million gal-
lons of milk containing precious pro-
tein and other valuable hon-fat solids
are left on the farms. Another 220
million gallons of casein and cheese
whey, containing 60,000 tons of solids,
drains from our dairy factories to
create a disposal problem. If this
state of affairs is permitted to persist
much longer, while the world starves, it
will become our shame. Waste on
such a profligate scale can only be
called horrific.
Weighty excuses abound, of course,
but lack of technical know-how to
extract, salvage, and concentrate the
food in these watery fluids is rapidly
ceasing to be one of them. CSIRO’s
Division of Dairy Research has shown
how 96 percent of the casein and whey
proteins of skim milk can be extracted
in a form fit for human consumption.
Previous extraction methods removed
less than 80 percent, and most of
the product was suited only for
industrial purposes such as coating
paper for the glossy magazines
and making adhesives. And even these
uses are declining with the develop-
ment of plastics and other modern
chemicals. This new, high-grade casein
with its associated co-proteins is now
finding diverse uses.
Mr. L. Muller, one of the CSIRO
men closely associated with this de-
velopment, is now advocating the
manufacture of E.D., whey (electro-
dialysed). At present most of the
smaller dairy factories are letting their
whey waste. He points out that the
composition of E.D. whey closely re-
sembles that of human milk and that
the cost of its production is quite low,
provided it is conducted on a fairly
large scale. The trend to consolidation
among our small factories should enable
this process to be adopted. Mr. Muller
is also suggesting another means of
utilising whey by converting its sugar
to yeast. The final product, known as
“Wheast,” makes a very high quality
stock-feed.
Sterilised milk products are now
about ready for commercial exploita-
tion. Their appearance will have a
momentous effect on beverage-milk
consumption. Sterilisation may eventu-
ally largely replace pasteurisation. The
name “fasterise” has been coined for
it, though sterilised milk is presently
known as U.H.T. milk (ultra-heat
treated). Commercial-scale plant to
handle it is now being built by the
U.S. Steel Corporation, Pittsburg,
Pennsylvania. The milk, containers,
and covers are led into an enclosed
system where the filling and sealing
operations are done within two seconds
in an atmosphere of superheated steam
at around 300 deg. F. Under these
conditions only minor flavor changes
occur in the milk, which, theoretically,
will keep indefinitely without refrigera-
tion.

A
RUSSIAN JOURNEY
By GEOFFREY DUTTON
I
Peredelkino
(Home and burial place
of Boris Pasternak)
The woods are light and dark as the Russian soul,
The tender, ever-changing birches, the strong
Unsmiling pines. Words like bark, song
Like leaves, curl and fall into the soil.
In the cemetery above the valley, two pines
Leaning as close as lovers interlock
Across the poet’s grave. Without a lock
A gate opens in the little picket fence,
To a seat where a young woman sits alone
Gazing unweeping at the flowers, flowers, flowers
In the vases and jars at the feet of the pines, and the
wildflowers
And clover growing around the plain brown stone.
Across the valley the roof of his house shows green,
Discreet and private, hidden from the valley where
Ten thousand people came, outside the glare
Of public notice, their grief a silent groan.
In the smoky little church nearby, old women
Are active as witches in a cave, their knees
And lips brush the stone worn like trees
A branch has rubbed softly as the word Amen.
II
The tyranny of things
Freed from the tyranny of things,
From the dolly in the box that sings
Of angels with instant pastry wings,
From the healthy fun that smoking brings,
From saucepans when the doorbell rings,
From sizes only fit for kings,
From all get-together, go-better things,
From always wanting, working, buying,
From saving five percent on dying,
Disappointing, envying, comparing,
And then the hunger in the staring
At the later model with the nylon bearing,
From the thousand-dollar prize for spelling
CAT and naming the best-selling
Detergent (also the sweetest smelling),
From the gentle pastel softness waiting
For the body’s unmentionable defecating,
From the mink and jewels and escort feting
The protected woman menstruating,
From tactful pressure-packs for spraying
Truths not' even your friends are saying,
From all the joys and comforts giving
Us each day our gracious living,
Freed!
How empty
The day’s street seems,
How drab its walls, where no neon gleams,
Its papers, where no titcake pops,
Its squares, where instead of screaming shops
Stands silent Pushkin, ten feet tall,
Ignoring the slogans on the wall.
It can’t be true that people, live well
Without the help of soft or hard sell,
Waiting two years for a car, in queues
For Georgian fruit or foreign shoes;
In our commercial world called free
People would die of such austerity,
In the boredom of walking through the woods
Unpursued by consumer goods.
Sad Russians! No moneygrub at their hearts,
With little left but sport and the arts,
(For both are boredom’s parasites,
Poor substitutes for bought delights).
Queueing half a mile or so
For theatre or a foreign art show,
Reading Tolstoy by the dam,
Or Yevtushenko in the tram,
Remembering the blood that tyranny wrings,
But free from the tyranny of things.
No doubt there are many other torments
In these great blocks of small apartments,
But the nights at least are silent, free
From that hum of electricity,
The HP things, the Pay-As-You-Rent,
Ticking the hours, cent by cent,
Like a car battery left switched on,
Running down, going, gone.

Wooden Houses
Those joyless partners, the bulldozer and the set-square,
Bowed to each other across the desolation,
Combed the stones and tree stumps from their hair
And made sullen love behind the railway station,
That Ideal Home for all who run on rails
To the parallels and rectangles of jails.
From Georgia to Leningrad their bleak children stand,
Unashamed of being identical,
Their concrete boots on the unhealed scars of land,
Their window eyes precisely vertical,
No jewellery, dressed in sensible grey or brown,
On all their faces the same impeccable frown.
But thousands of an earlier illegitimate brood
Hide in leafy intimate Moscow squares,
Or lurch and leap like dogs beside the roads,
Or shelter in birch woods, rock at country fairs,
The little old Russian houses of painted wood
Like toys left over from the nation’s childhood.
Traditional yet fresh as nursery tales,
With blue carved doorways and a red jumped-up clown
Of an attic in the middle of a roof that inevitably fails
To be dignified, on a wall with one shoulder down,
They look as if they grew from growing things,
Shrinking in the winters, flowering in the springs.
One neighbor is a reckless purple, another green,
And the flowers crowd in at the crooked window
With a procession of wooden animals carved between,
And a house for birds hangs where the birch-leaves blow.
Individual lives are a secret presence,
Their ins and outs guarded by a picket fence.
Down the road that runs past the houses goes a truck
Full of girls from the factory shouting and blowing kisses
At the stolid driver of the car behind them. No luck,
His cap stays dead square, his engine never misses,
Poured into his suit as correctly mixed as concrete,
He is the new man, no wandering in his feet.
O Russia, keep your wooden houses before it is too late,
Let them wave and behave incorrectly to all passers-by,
May the old woman from the well enter the picket gate
With a child at her hand, knowing her time to die,
Not yet, though across the valley the bulldozer roars
For the day of the concrete box with a thousand doors.

To Mikhail Vrubel
(Mikhail Vrubel, 1856-1911,
Russian symbolist painter)
The dry day lapsed, no answer came.
At midnight under the moonlight
The lid of cloud slid down.
O dark girl hiding in the flowers of night
How can the light you love and live by
Reveal the stars in the shadowed garden?
You exist in the darkness that he made for you,
While the sun is in his eyes
And the salt hardens on his skin.
He is brisk at winning things,
Deserts smoke at his heels, and in the Oases
Flowers sing like looping rainbow birds.
Your letters were waiting at each trading post
In those outback countries where heat shakes like water,
But he rode on and on, by camel, donkey
And a narrow train with stifling velvet seats
Toward the jungle where he could be moist again.
O dark girl hiding in the flowers of night
All you can do is wait,
For arrows of light have destroyed him,
Blinded by bandits in Abyssinia
Who never touched his eyes
But simply cut his eyelids off,
Throwing them twitching on to the white stones
Where they lay like the veined beaks of new-born
sparrows.
V
Georgian Wine
This sky of other stars is just like mine,
It revolves on wine.
Drunk in the crackling darkness of the maize,
Grabbing for balance at the tendrils of beans
I fall on the glossy breasts of aubergines.
I am extinguished, but the spinning stars blaze.
Out on the grass under peach trees, retreating, advancing,
Couples are dancing.
The accordions are squeezing the scent of herbs from
sauces
Over the bones of sucking pigs, geese, and quail.
The stars dance for me. All the pale
Virgins are carried off by warriors on black horses.
The clodded earth carries me and does not complain
If wine is rain.
I think the tamadar, the toastmaster, is still proposing
The health of the people of the United States,
But here in my furrow a melon gyrates
While an Australian capitalist is dozing.
I wake, stagger out. I am mortally ashamed,
Ready to be blamed>
The honor of my country is a row of squashed tomatoes.
A Russian and a Georgian poet catch me,
The silent peasant women watch me.
At the table the marigold-colored wine still flows.
Suddenly I realise they love me for being drunk.
I have not sunk
But risen in their sky of measuring other worlds.
The stars are tips of daggers merging.
Liberty is not a virgin.
Her health! And Queen Tamara’s! And all other girls’!
Hugged by the earth, the full-breasted wine jars
Reflect the stars.
A drunken man must try to carry his head
Somewhere between the two. Good friends
Steady the neck with their wrists when it bends.
A virgin could lie safely in his bed.
VI
Two Houses, Stalin's and
Maya kovsky's
In one wild Georgian day I saw two houses
Where two boys were born who grew too big to die.
In Georgia the sun does not sleep, but all night carouses
In the rays of wine, and at dawn its vodka-pale eye
Looks into the cellar where laborers, poets, and Ministers
Are eating a soup of tripe and garlic in the smoke.
Such a driver’s breakfast gives a car’s tyre blisters,
But for Georgians a car is a stallion not a moke.


We tumbled out at the marble mausoleum,
And found a little intimate house under the lid
Of the gleaming pavilion by the Roman-splendored
museum.
It was all Stalin. And like the stones of a pyramid
Greased with blood the marble slid through the sunlight.
The moustaches on the statues did not whisper, but the
eyes
Of the young revolutionary still glowed bright
From the prisons that were to be made into paradise.
Then off over the mountains to Bagdadi, rechristened
Mayakovsky, and a wooden house on stones
And brick pillars, raised by a river, where all that
glistened
Was the golden light on golden persimmons.
Unshed blood shone through the wattles of turkeys
In the sun on dahlias and the bottoms of shovelling ducks.
Only the river roared. But the same furnace
That should have turned the camera lense to flux
Burnt in this other revolutionary’s eyes.
The peaceful mountain river began to bleed
And the peasant-warming sun of seasons that dries
The pale corncob and the striped sunflower-seed
Rose red and dried a million corpses black.
The poet’s statues are unnatural sunflowers
Forced to look into the light, but his words attack
Darkness and also fall in shaded showers.
The dictator’s statues are all gone. At Sochumi
A helicopter lifted one and dropped it in the sea.
VII
Useless Beauty
In the country palace of the worst, mad Tsar
The good, sane people on the parquet floor
Look up to the breasts of nymphs and the fat knees
Of cherubs in the golden ceiling. The photo shows
The sky for ceiling and the bombed walls, but not
The Germans who did it, nor the craftsmen who bit
By bit put the caryatids together again.
The imperial toy is working now, but the shine
Of diamonds is behind glass. In through the gates,
Through the white smoke of burning leaves, the shouts
Of children chasing a soccer ball bounce on the stones
Louder than any gilt coach with silver reins.
There are museums for coaches, too, the trappings of
horses,
But not the whips cracking in the peasants’ faces;
Shafts crusted with pearls, doors embossed
With emeralds, the great creaking past
No tractor could shift forwards. And the old soldiers,
Who always walked with the generals on their shoulders,
Limp one-legged wondering by,
Admiring the splendid excess of an unjust day.
So cherished, these symbols of all they ought to hate.
And in Leningrad, where two canals meet,
A huge brick and marble arch, perfection
Caught for ever in the canal’s reflection
Under the golden leaf-losing trees.
Why? What use was it? No one knows.
But Daniel who lives there knows the reason well.
“Sometimes the useless things are the most beautiful.”
VIII
End Of The Journey
Those who live in the country are not likely
To be tempted by the pathetic fallacy.
It is a lamb that is crying for milk
Not the droughty soil in pain calling for rain.
Yet I feel now like an old weedy paddock
Ploughed up and over and down,
All that brown accustomed surface
Ripped up red, showing bones, ant-tunnels, and stones.
Around me are the dams that have been dry two summers,
The river a string of pools . . .
. . . High over Turkestan
I saw a river shining like a wing in the desert,
And the soft green pads of irrigation below the claws
Of a range like a monitor lizard . . .
We have one river, a number
Of deserts and lizards, and strange dry souls.
We have never been ripped. We grow good wine
On vines never fed on blood.
Our wounded are tight-lipped as scars
And eat no fruit from roots their blood manured.
How can we dare to be so innocent, so bare, as if the
sun
Could only make skin brown?
We survived, lean as saltbush.
Then grew fat as melons on our flat ground.
I am haunted by the guilty words of a young Australian:
“I have never suffered,” he said,
“Never seen a dead man,
A starving child or one burnt by a bomb.”
From Turkestan to Leningrad the hurt people
Turn their heads toward me.
The scars are German or Stalin’s,
It does not matter, since the battered flesh is theirs.
He spent sixteen years in Stalin’s labor camps.
Her children were killed by the Germans.
He is fat because he starved.
The dead glow like birch trees when the sun is low.
The best that we can do is kill each other
In cars, as if to prove
We have the power to do so.
The foreigners we shoot are never the color of our days.
I had a dream that a black sealed train
Ran through the heat on rails
That shone like rivers of rain,
To white Lake Eyre lying calmer than the sea.
And there it halted, and its doors clanked open
On the gassed naked bodies
And the children of jellied fire,
While the stained salt screamed for its lost purity.

Nightmare Abbey, Canberra
By PETER COLEMAN
Communism in Asia. A Threat to
Australia? Proceedings of 33rd
Summer School, Australian Institute
of Political Science. Angus and
Robertson. $1.95.
I SYMPATHISED WITH Harry
Turner, MHR, when I started to read
this book. Opening his part of the
discussion, after one of the papers in
Canberra, he ironically congratulated
the organisers of the Summer School
for picking a subject, “Communism in
Asia. A threat to Australia?” which
had already been massively debated
and decided in an election. Here we
go again, I thought, once more round
the block: heartless moralising and
gutlessness from the Lefties, those con-
temporary mixtures of Marx, Morris
West, and Twiggy, while from the saner
commentators yet another exposition of
the facts of power, freedom, and
morality. Reviewing it seemed a dull
assignment. I remember a seminar in
Kuala Lumpur a couple of years ago
when, no doubt out of boredom with
themselves, the hard-line anti-Com-
munists suddenly started to attack the
Americans and the soft-liners decided
to get stuck into the Reds.
Yet, as it turns out, this is a good
book, and the excellent point it makes
is that patriotism is not enough. This
has a particular relevance to Australians,
who tend to rely on their patriotism
as both their bulwark against Com-
munism and their reason for dismiss-
ing discussion of it as a bore. And,
indeed, if our traditions were enough
to carry us through the international
catastrophes ahead, they would be
right, for heaven knows there are
few more patriotic democracies than
Australia. To a people with its own
established and enjoyed institutions,
from suburbia and clubs to churches
and RSLs, its own systems of tolerance
and celebration, Communism has
nothing to offer. Compared with Anzac
Day, the Communists’ pretence of
speaking for “the masses” is a pretty
seedy joke.
But in popular view the Communist
threat is usually seen as a threat of
foreign invasion followed by terrorism
and enslavement. Faced with this
prospect, a Communist fifth column
in Australia would be quickly dealt
with. But this is one possibility and
not the only or most immediate one.
The threat discussed in this book is of
a different kind and does not assume
a direct invasion. It depends on two
possibilities happening. The first is a
Communist victory in Vietnam and
takeover of South-East Asia, and the
second is American reconciliation with
this and withdrawal from the whole
region, including Australia, which would
not be needed by America as a base for
reconquest as in World War II and
may not be considered worth risking a
nuclear war with Peking. Assume these
possibilities happened; Australia would
then remain nominally independent, but
without American protection and facing
a Communist South-East Asia. What
then?
Owen Harries puts the issues most
sharply in his paper, the best and
most central in the book. We would be
vulnerable, he says, in several ways:
our trade routes through South-East
Asia to the non-Communist world
could be denied us; New Guinea would
be a standing arena for border disputes;
and as a white, developed, underpopu-
lated capitalist democracy next to
brown, underdeveloped, overpopulated
Communist States we would be a made-
to-measure target for sustained diplo-
matic and propaganda campaigns. “A
combination of such tactics as these,
employed over a period of time, would
be likely to bring about major changes
in the character of Australian society,
in the quality of life lived in it. One can
only speculate about what precisely
these changes would be.” His own
speculation is that either Australia
would become bitterly divided between
pro- and anti-Communists or would
close its ranks in a beleaguered, isolated,
intolerant anti-Communist garrison. In
either case there is a threat to our way
of life, without raising the question of
outright invasion.
Speculating in the same vein, my
own nightmare is that these assumed
circumstances could so favor the Left
that we could become a People’s Demo-
cracy under the outward parodies of
our own traditions. We would still
have the ABC news at seven and prob-
ably still put out the rubbish tins on
Sunday nights, but, under a nauseating
compulsory enthusiasm for a Pan-
Asian New Order, the news commen-
tators would sing the trading possi-
bilities with Peking, the virtues of a
truly independent foreign policy (i.e.,
appeasement), and denounce the
lingering sentimental attachment to
America. Folksingers would strum out
messages of “Peace” at the clubs, and
“progressive” priests would deliver
Sunday sermons on Pan-Asians and
Communism as the message of Jesus
to the 20th Century. Unions and
Chambers of Commerce would share
free trips to Peking and a new syllabus
committee would get to work rewriting
our history for our children, stressing
imperialism, monopoly capitalism,
exploited Aborigines and New Guineans,
racist immigration policies, militarist
RSLs, and the excitement of the New
Australia. Australia would be a hell
of shame and servility and in the end
the earnest leaders would call in allied
Communist troops from Asia to
suppress the reactionaries who dream
of the past and plot with the emigres.
The radio stations would play “Advance
Australia Fair” day and night, and
in America and Britain small meetings
would pass resolutions of sympathy and
take up collections for refugees.

phrase


Centre was not really Nightmare Abbey.
The discussion was only about possi-
bilities. We are winning in Vietnam
and the Americans show no sign of
leaving South-East Asia to a Peking
Co-Prosperity Sphere. Assuming vic-
tory or a genuine negotiated settlement
in Vietnam, the most likely future for
Australia is one of traditional develop-
ment under American protection; in
other words what Mr. Santamaria has,
in a stinging phrase, called the Holt
Stereotype (i.e., relying absolutely on
the American alliance; All the Way,
etc.) may well be sound. But this
dictates two obvious policies: ensuring
a permanent American commitment to
South-East Asia and committing our-
selves more heavily to our own defence
in case the Americans withdraw. The
grave weakness in the Holt Stereotype
is that it does not openly acknowledge
the possibility of or need for any alter-
native to the American alliance. Cer-
tainly there is no justification for the
ironical disdain for our anxiety that
Professor Max Beloff, of Oxford, shows
in this book: “For Australians the idea
of danger and the permanence of
danger, of living in an unpleasant and
uncomfortable world for as far ahead
as one can possibly see has come over
the past 20 years or so as something of
a novel experience and as a shock.
Think of the position of Western
Europe, all of whose cities have been
targeted by Soviet missile bases for
the past ten or fifteen years.” As any
glance through the Australian editorials
and cartoons over the past 100 years
shows, Australians have lived with a
sense of catastrophe for generations,
most notably since the almost unknown
Japanese sank the mighty Russian fleet
in 1905. This, more than nostalgia,
has been the basis for British sentiment
in Australia: we relied on the Royal
Navy to save us from catastrophe as
we now rely on the Americans. But,
unlike Professor Beloff’s wise old ironic
Europeans (so maturely calm about
danger that they all went down to
Hitler in one spring and would have
stayed there if they had not been
rescued by the Americans), we cannot
so absolutely rely on the Americans
and our survival or revival is less
guaranteed.
This is also the main weakness in
Dr. Goh Keng Swee’s famous paper in
this book. He outlines two essential
counter-measures against the Com-
munists: one is social reform, including
preventing an overproduction of intel-
lectuals, of university graduates with-
out prospects of useful employment;
the other is an efficient Security Service
to penetrate Communist organisations.
He barely mentions the American
alliance. He may have domestic poli-
tical reasons for reticence, but we have
no such inhibitions. Nor does he men-
tion national defence. But perhaps the
real danger in Vietnam is not outright
defeat but such a spilling of young
American blood for the cause of
freedom that they will say: Never again.
Crucial questions
S. Chandrasekhar... no time left
By PETER SAMUEL
Asia’s Population Problems. S. Chan-
drasekhar (editor). George Allen and
Unwin. $7.00.
AS PEOPLE WHO have met him will
confirm, Mr. Chandrasekhar is a man
of great energy and enthusiasm, but
like many of his countrymen he is
accursedly fluent. He writes and talks
so much he has no time left to find
any new and significant things to say.
His book is mostly an assembly of
the basic demographic data of eight
Asian countries with a few comments
on what is being done to promote family
planning. Nothing interesting emerged
for this reader except an indication that
the editor had not even read his con-
tributors’ pieces very carefully. Mr.
Chandrasekhar at one point says that
illiteracy in Asia ranges from 70 per-
cent in India to 30 percent in Japan.
Yet his contributor on Japan states
(quite correctly, of course) that illiter-
acy has long disappeared; and the con-
tributor on Taiwan puts the illiteracy
rate there at 24 percent. Facts, year-
book-style, are profuse, but they are
displayed, not used for analysis.
The articles throw no light on such
crucial questions as: what are the most
effective ways of promoting birth con-
trol? To what extent is a decline in
fertility a product of urbanisation? Does
the provision of social security reduce
the incentive to have children?
At the end of the book, quite anom-
alously, are articles arguing the case
for Australia’s taking Asian migrants.
Both writers, A. Clunies Ross and K.
Rivett, have put their quite unassailable
case umpteen times before, and it is now
thoroughly accepted. Rather than bor-
ing us all by saying it yet again, they
would do better to take a trip to Can-
berra to point out to a small handful
of politicians and bureaucrats who are
going slow on liberalisation that there
is no longer any opposition to progres-
sive change.
Name droppers
By NANCY KEESING
A Pursuit of Furies. Janice Warnke.
Collins. $3.15.
THIS NOVEL contains all the ingredi-
ents from which gift and library
favorites are made. The well-educated,
much-travelled author takes for her
recipe a group of people living at the
Swiss villa of Mrs. Gwendolyn Dartley.
Mrs. Dartley is an old woman whose
marriages, loves, and friendships have
acquainted her with Great Figures
from the Past and Present and a per-
sonal involvement in 20th-century poli-
tics and disasters.
Her house party includes a beautiful
woman writer named Sylvie (nick-
named Faustine) whose two suitors
are “St. George” Bingham, an under-
cover agent, and Campion, an erstwhile
nuclear physicist.
Also present are some elderly Euro-
peans who wrangle about Wagner and
a pair of nice young Americans who
have to find themselves. Knox, a horrid
television entrepreneur, and Bledder,
his assistant, who is more horrid, lurk.
At the drop of an international
incident (it is 1956 and Hungary and
Suez are due to erupt) everyone be-
comes involved in intense soul search-
ings, hasty missions, dramas, coinci-
dences. However, they still find time
and heart for discourse about Jane
Austen, Monteverdi, Mozart—they
admire Rubens and name-drop Picasso.
There are depths—allegorical and
symbolic—but the author kindly
explains her symbols in detail and inter-
weaves those myths from which they
are drawn. (Dastardly Bledder kills a
pet fish—its ritual burial poses a pretty
problem.)
Revolutions fail, but love on the
whole triumphs. Sex is ever present,
always heterosexual, and although some-
times unblessed by wedding rings is
treated in a way which could offend
neither teenage daughters nor culture-
hungry grandmothers. One shocking
word is printed, but the character who
utters it has the grace to apologise.
Secular pseudonyms
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
Crisis in the Life of an Actress. Soren
Kierkegaard. Collins. $3.15.
MORE THAN a century ago, when
Kierkegaard wrote these three studies,
the title one was intended both as a
sincere appreciation of the great
artistry of the Copenhagen Royal
Theatre’s leading lady Hanne Heiberg,
who was married to a rival Hegelian


philosopher, and as an examination
of theatrical aesthetics in general.
It may come as a surprise to the
layman that Kierkegaard, who thought
of himself primarily as a religious
theologian, should not only have been
such an ardent playhouse and opera
fan but was also so far ahead of his
time that he made actresses and
operetta singers the subject of serious
philosophical theses. This collection
contains a pamphlet on a comic opera
singer and a short analysis of Mozart’s
“Don Giovanni.”
Kierkegaard first published some of
these pieces in a Danish newspaper
under one of his many secular
pseudonyms. Stephan Crites has not
only translated them into English for
the first time but has added a lengthy
and scholarly introduction.
“The Crisis” traces the growth of an
actress: at the age of 16, Hanne, then
a mere fledgeling, had achieved over-
night fame as Juliet, but did not
play the role again until she was over
30. This time, starring with a young
Romeo, the public and the critics pro-
nounced her a failure. Kierkegaard,
who found her performance one of
supreme artistry, sets out to prove that
the failure was in the minds of her
audience.
In what must be one of the first
modern examinations of the mass psy-
chology of an audience, the philosopher
proves that the very misunderstanding
that elevated her prematurely to star-
dom and made her public property for
15 years is responsible for tearing her
down from her rightful pedestal just at
the moment of her highest aesthetic
achievement.
“Herr Phister as Captain Scipio” is
a similar examination of a comic opera
singer in the part of a drunken guards-
man. K. puts Phister’s every movement
under a scientic lens. Here, at last,
Kierkegaard is trapped in his own time,
and as a modern-minded musician I
must disagree completely. The musi-
cologist Dr. Alfred Einstein has already
pointed out that Kierkegaard’s views
on “Don Giovanni” are rooted in the
beginning of the 19th century.
Wodehouse cult
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
Wooster’s World. Geoffrey Jaggard.
Macdonald and Co. $3.85.
P. G. WODEHOUSE, during the
’twenties and ’thirties, was regarded as a
very funny man. Changing tastes and
some unfortunate broadcasts about Ger-
many during the war threw him into
disfavor. Now he has been rediscovered
and made the subject of a cult.
His books are skittish and diverting;
P. G. Wodehouse ... lost touch
the short stories in particular are in
their slight way models of construction,
and I suppose he could be regarded as a
minor recorder of a dead and gone age.
(His postwar stories, having lost touch
with the world, seem faded and dated,
whereas his early writing is still fresh
and funny.) Further than this it seems
absurd to take him seriously.
Now Geoffrey Jaggard produces a
sort of concordance of the Jeeves-
Wooster stories, an honor I’d thought
reserved for Shakespeare and the Bible,
and though there are heavy-handed
attempts at Wodehousean humor, the
whole thing breathes a solemn rever-
ence for “the Master,” as Mr. Jaggard
calls him. Of course, it’s not fair to read
a book like this straight through, since
it’s presumably intended as a work of
reference, but who needs one? It’s
much more fun to read the originals,
and in any case Wodehouse himself
obviously didn’t work from any
genealogical table; he provides his
characters with hitherto unmentioned
sisters, uncles, and children as the mood
takes him, which makes some of Mr.
Jaggard’s references pretty confusing.
I won’t claim to be a Wodehouse
authority in Mr. Jaggard’s class, but,
since the Jeeves short stories are a
favorite bedside book, I was able to test
him by looking up some fairly obscure
references, and I’m bound to admit they
were all there. The book is a curious
feat of—not scholarship but misapplied
perseverance; like building models of
the Harbor Bridge out of dead matches
or making enormous balls of silver
paper, it’s a harmless pastime but of
very little practical value.
In his Introduction, Mr. Jaggard
claims to have written a complete Wode-
house Concordance, an enterprise which
he tells us the Master has approved.
Understandably—the w'hole thing must
have appealed forcibly to his acute sense
of the ridiculous.
Mental hothouse
By J. M. COUPER
Omensetter’s Luck. William H. Gass.
Collins. $2.65.
A MAN WHO IS different from other
people, and a preacher who is too much
the same, which has the secrets of
living? Omensetter’s simple trust is
briefly and sufficiently suggested by his
journey over the muddiest roads in a
wagon piled high with his possessions
and quite unprotected against rain. He
settles contentedly in a house far too
near the Ohio River. He gives himself
a job with the local blacksmith. He
knows that his pregnant wife will bear
him a boy. He is not at all reckless.
His luck is the simplicity of his life.
The Reverend Jethro Furber, from
his pulpit on a Sunday morning, can
see Omensetter happily skating stones
over the Ohio River. He resents his
built-in pagan happiness. The Reverend
Furber is prevented by the .mere fact
of the physical functions of the human
body from believing in anything at all.
His head has become a sexual sewage
system, and we are cajoled into farm-
ing for ourselves with all that he thinks
and says: “Indecent prepositions such
as in, on, up merely made them smile,
and the roundest exclamation broke
upon them like a bubble’s kiss. Smooth
and creamy adjectives enabled them to
lick their lips upon the crudest story.”
A mild example.
Although this is a first novel, William
H. Gass is too seasoned a writer not to
know that the hothouse of the mind
is a limitation, or at any rate a danger,
of the stream-of-consciousness style. He
counteracts it in two ways that are
very impressive and of a high artistic
skill. In the climax and denouement,
the novel gains much of its pace, ten-
sion, and conviction from the contrast
and build-up that has preceded it,
largely in the mind, behaviour, and
conclusions of the Reverend Furber.
Out of the bizarre and murky
world of people’s obsessions and lusts
comes the steadiness of Omensetter’s
healthier impulses, and their final
vindication, when we had begun to fear
that everybody would be foolish and
charge him with murder on the flimsiest
of plausible suspicions.
The second impressive tour de force
is the extraordinary skill with which
the writer lays down his dialogue, rarely
telling us who is talking, even when all
his actors are pinched together in a
snowstorm. Each man’s “stream-of-
consciousness,” as it were, cannot be
prevented from issuing on his tongue.
It is not a triumph of character por-
trayal, but a simple insistence on what
is happening to each man at one and
the same moment, a demonstration of
life’s variety. The novel ends very
strongly and with expedition, and leaves
an impression of grace and complete-
ness.

Dairies' future
Having tried dairy farming in the
Sydney Milk Zone, the problems of
the industry have led me to certain
conclusions. The durability of a dairy
farm depends primarily on its equip-
ment, organisation, and quality of its
stock, not on its size. Even so the
optimum-sized herd for an individual
farmer is definitely nearer 30 cows than
50, and anything larger necessarily be-
comes more inefficient. In fact, a good
living can be made in the Sydney
Zone with a dairy of 15 cows on 20
acres of land provided that:
(a) Farmers change their present
specialisation of being milkers-of-cows
only, and grow all, or nearly all, their
own crops (especially grazing mix-
tures) and provide their own irrigation
system from a sufficient dam or dams.
Many dairy farmers (they often are
merely “investors in the industry” so to
speak) never graze their cows, and/or
never grow a crop. Some don’t even
raise their own calves and heifers but
are continually selling dry cows and
buying cows newly calved—a stock-
breeder’s nightmare. All these prac-
tices in, say, the Ohio Valley, would
undoubtedly be businesslike, but with
our history of droughts, floods, and the
concomitant fluctuation of feed and
stock prices, are wasteful and ludicrous
in the extreme. They guarantee the
farmer no constant margin at all, save
by, perhaps, further increases in the
retail price of milk, already exorbi-
tant.
(b) Dairies are not forced out of the
30in.-50in. rainfall belt between New-
castle and Wollongong, as they have
been, and will continue to be, as the
suburbs grow. The better rainfall of
this area, supporting small crop-
growing dairies close to the market,
would ensure a more reliable farm
income and a cheaper milk supply.
(c) Butterfat and cheese-milk dairies
are, perhaps,, a separate problem alto-
gether, and the different types of dairies
should not be confused.
The advantages of smaller herds
should be obvious, but the vogue seems
that bigger organisations are neces-
sarily more efficient than smaller ones.
Surely doctrine is irrelevant, and what
are the facts in each particular industry
and its branches only should be con-
sidered.
In fact, smaller herds can be quali-
tatively improved much more readily
and faster than large ones, if for no
other reason than the large-dairy owner
has not sufficient time (or inclination)
to 4 spend on the individual beast, to
know the qualities and temperament
of each, assess breeding potential, etc.
Moreover, on large dairies, the owner
very often doesn’t milk the cows, or
seldom, or few, so he cannot make the
day-to-day judgments which are essen-
tial in the industry to improve the
herds.
Such small “self-sufficient” dairies, as
I have advocated, unfortunately require
even more capital per acre to start
with than the present “drag-the-milk-
out-of-them, slap-the - Hunter-Valley-
lucerne-into-them” dairies require. But
as The Bulletin of June 3 said, seeing
we are subsidising the industry anyway
(by high prices in the case of whole
milk) it would seem better to provide
the capital to have a solid basis, in
order to remove these burdens in the
foreseeable future.

Higham's Sydney
I, too, read Higham’s Sydney, and the
nostalgia of the phrase “This is the
place to live” can only be felt by those
who have savored the experience. For
25 years it was the place to live.
But the Sydney of which Higham
writes, with its very comfortable open
living, has gone for ever. Sydney today
is headed in the same direction as New
York, Tokyo, and —Blacktown. Though
the crows fly backwards in this newer
addition to Suburbia, the result is not
pleasing.
I, for one, have no desire to return
to Sydney.

The wrong way?
You must be joking. Is the Fill worth
300 million dollars? (8., July 8.) You
political bigots have lost your senses.
Let’s go back to the beginning, March,
1939, an Air Mission from the U.K.,
and the recommendation that Austra-
lian Government build its own fighters
and dive-bombers from the Wirraway,
the C.A.C. 12, and C.A.C. 4 for the
defence of the Malay Barrier, as a
joint project, British-Australian.
Upgrade it to 1969, and what have
you. Australian industry and the RAAF
supplying C.A.C. versions of the
N.A.FIOO fighter and the F.6A dive-
bomber to Indonesia, Singapore, and
Malaysia as a joint defence project.
Throw in some Orions, and proficiency
must win.
The Fill is already obsolescent. It
shot down Arthur Calwell twice, once
in 1963 and again in 1966, but Whit-
lam had training as an air-gunner when
he went to war in 8245.

Apologies to Miss Scotter
Recently I was in Europe and America
for two months and have only just got
around to reading “back” copies of
The Bulletin. To my horror I see that
my name is mentioned in an article by
Daphne Guinness (8., March 18) in
which Mrs. Du Val is quoted as saying:
“She once told the editor of ‘Vogue
Australia,’ Sheila Scotter, to leave the
room for talking clothes with another
pupil. ‘They come to learn about
cooking and food—besides, it’s bad
manners to talk when being taught.’ ”
I should be grateful if you would
correct this statement to your readers
because: I have never been to Mrs.
Du Val’s house; I have never had a
cooking lesson from a professional
cook; and I object to the inference that
I am ill-mannered.

Whipping horses
It gave me great pleasure to read in
your recent issue (8., June 17) Batman’s
interview with Mr. Hoysted re whipping
of racehorses. It always bewildered
me why these animals were allowed to
be openly flogged, with apparently no
action taken by the police or the
various anti-cruelty groups, until Mr.
Hoysted took action.
The sooner the whipping of these
horses is stopped the better for this
community.
W. S. Pizzey
East Ivanhoe, Vic.
I wish to thank you from the bottom
of my heart for your article on the
whipping of racehorses, and for the
very valuable publicity you gave Mr.
Hoysted’s cause. I am deeply concerned
about the cruelty to these sensitive,
beautiful creatures in the name of sport
and for the sake of money. Mr. Hoy-
sted is a very good man indeed, with
compassion for animals.

for the overweight and/or poverty-
stricken; but, “paraphrase”—really!!
