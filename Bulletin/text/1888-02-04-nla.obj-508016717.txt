The Dirt-Eaters of New South Wales.
Amid much boasting of the advance of
modern civilisation, the political institutions
of the world remain in some respects very
much where they did 10,000 years ago.
Man in the nineteenth century leaves a
larger footprint on the sands of time than
his ancestors did ; he builds bigger piles of
bricks and mortar than his predecessors,
and the spread of literature enables each
ignoble Jones to erect his dusty pyramid in
the back-yard of history, and hand himself
down to posterity bound in appropriate
half-calf. There are more great men to the
square mile now than formerly, or at least
there appear to be. In the days of the past
great men had generally to wait till the
world recognised them as such, but now
they write to the newspapers and announce
their own eminence, and, thanks to this judi-
cious system of advertising, the Smiths of the
present loom up and obscure the Soloks of
antiquity, and the back-blocks Mayor who
receives an illuminated address for his ser-
vices in driving the goats off the town
reserve, is puffed by the press until he
eclipses the long dynasties of the Pharaohs
with all the sages of Greece and Arabia
thrown in. The world contains more
wealth than of old, more tinsel, and more
vanity, hypocrisy and debt; and these
things, combined with an elaborate system
of mutual admiration, make up the
alleged civilisation of the nineteenth
century. Bat man himself is the same un-
changed, unchangeable being as of old.
The so-called Christian of-to-day, beneath
his coat of broadcloth, is identical with the
Pagan of thousands of years ago beneath his
coat of paint and grime. He worships the
same terrestrial gods as did his remote ances-
tors. The dirt-eaters of the earth are still
uppermost.
• • «
In this day of Centennial feeds and Cen-
tennial lies and drivel, New South Wales
wastes much self-gratulation upon the sub-
ject of her political institutions. The spread
of Democratic principles enables her to elect
the scum of her population to make laws for
her people and to represent them before an
admiring world ; whereas, in the dark ages
of the past, before the Democracy existed,
the ancestors of the Australian nation were
ruled by the scum of their own generation-
only the human refuse of that time was a
hereditary institution and held its absolute
sway by virtue of the doctrine of divine
right and the. sword. The world has seen
many forma of government, but they have
all possessed one feature in common—that
of being lower and more debased than the
people whose affairs they were supposed to
direct. The theocracy of Palestine was a
government of divine revelation, but the re-
velation was filtered through a dubious race
of bloodthirsty prophets, and the result was
a hideous epoch of alternate slavery and re-
volt. The system of absolute monarchy,
which was long accepted as the sole refuge
from anarchy, ran one invariable course of
misery and oppression ; government by an
oligarchy only meant the reign of many
tyrants in place of one ; and the modern
parliamentary institutions which masquerade
under the name of Liberty are already falling
Into decay in almost every country where
the Democracy has placed its trust in them.
In the course of a century of existence New
South Wales has tried almost all these
schemes in turn, and the result has been
nothing but failure. The Jewish system of
theocracy, indeed, she has omitted from the
list—government by divine revelation would
have neon strangely inappropriate in a land
where the only political revelations ever
known came from beneath, but the early
Governors, the New South Wales Corps, the
days of martial law, and the era of the
nominee Council supplied all the elements of
anarchy, absolute monarchy, and oligarchy ;
and finally the establishment of an elective
Assembly has added a species of sham
Democracy to the list of legislative experi-
ments which have been practised on an un-
fortunate colony. And in every case the
results have been the same. The Govern
ment has represented the lowest passions of
the populace, and from first to la t the dirt-
eaters of the nation have been its rulers,
and their rule has been worthy of their
character in every detail.
• ♦ *
Less than half a century has elapsed since
representative Government was established
in New South Wales, and already the system
is rotten in every branch. In many other
countries the sbam-Democra^io institution cf
a—so-called—popular chamber has flourished
for a while, and then fallen into a process of
slow decay, but. thanks to the policy of
Centralisation which has prevailed in the
mother-colony Australia, the Parlia-
mentary system Item decayed in its very
infancy, and has into senility before
the battle of national freedom was fairly
commenced. The very basis upon which
the people’s representatives are selected is
hopelessly animal in its selfishness, and
political policy consists In an appeal to the
lowest and narrowest of human passions.
In the p litical system of New South Wales
there is hardly one legislator who can be
said in any sense to represent the country at
large. Each member speaks on behalf of
some particular network of city slums, or
raises his voice in defence of some sleepy
township planted on some one-horse track
in the backwoods, and when the needs of
his own slum or his own special gully are
duly attended to the rest of the colony
may sink into the nether regions of
perdition if it chooses. Under the existing
system of Centralisation, almost every penny
of public money which is expended is a
bribe ; the party in power is the party that
is bought, and the party in opposition is the
party that is for sale unfurnished. The man
of independent mind is the only one who is
not wanted in New South Wales politics.
Unless a member is prepared to attach him-
self to a leader and vote with him through
good and evil, but principally through evil,
his district is left out in the division of the
spoils, and, therefore, the low, mercenary
ruffian, who will sell his country in con-
sideration of a bridge or a loop-line for the
wild cat region which sends him to the legis-
lative Pandemonium, is the ideal statesman
of New South Wales. The whole system of
government is framed to exclude, as far as
possible, everything bearing the slightest re-
semblance to talent or principle, and it is for
this reason that the acknowledged swindler
is the man who moat frequently holds
high office, and that the notorious
debauchee and the dubious insolvent
live longest 'in the annals of their
country. In New South Wales politics
Demosthenes would stand no show against
the publican at the come r, and Gladstone
would find himself at the bottom of the poll
unless he pledged himself to vote for a rail-
way to run through the swamp of the in-
fluential local resident and connect it with
the sandhill owned by the important man at
the other end of the electorate.
* * *
A complete measure of local government,
which would remove all expenditure on
public works from the control of the central
administration, and the abolition of the
present system of constituencies, are the
only means which promise to effect a cure of
this long-standing political leprosy. If New
South Wales is ever to be a nation her Par-
liamentary delegates must represent the
people at large instead of being so many
sons of the horse-leech sent to cadge money
at the sacrifice of principle and decency,
each on behalf of his own little knot of
followers. The petty local steals, which at
present block all usefol legislation, must be
relegated to local bodies and supplied out of
local funds, and when this is done and the
central Legislature is left to deal only with
affairs of national importance, it will be
fitting that its members should, as nearly as
possible, represent the nation as a whole
instead of each merely grinding an axe for
one little community cut off from its neigh-
bours by an imaginary electoral boundary.
For the purposes of the central administra-
tion New Sooth Wales should form some
four or five great constituencies, each with
six or eight members, and by this sweeping
reform the great mass of fraud and corruption
which disgraces the political system of
the colony would be reduced at once to a
minimum. The race of mental and moral
deadbeats who now form nine-tenths of the
Legislature, and who gain their seats by
their willingness to sink the interests of the
country at large so long as there is a log to
roll in the back street which returns them
to Parliament, would vanish for ever. The
chief duty of a politician would no longer
be to swamp every vestige of honour and
principle in the scramble for borrowed
money, for the existing Public Works
system would be a thing of the past, and the
patronage which has enabled so many
Premiers to buy a subservient following
would be utterly abolished, and with the re-
moval of this disability men with some trace
of a conscience would again become eligible
for seats in the House. The fact that' the
candidate would virtually have to appeal to
the country at large would make it essential
for his success that he should be possessed
of a certain measure of talent and reputa
tion instead of being, as he now frequently
is, the public-house oracle of a backwoods
township. The shady means by which
astute politicians are now enabled to tarry
an election in the face of an actual majority
would prove impracticable when it became
necessary to attempt them on a large scale,
and when great Issues were no longer made
subservient) to burning questions regard
ing a tank or a pump, the will ct
the people would be expressed with greater
clearness than has ever yet been possible.
Under the existing system, when a poli-
tician is dismissed, as Parkbs was at the
close of his last dictatorship, with ignominy
and rotten eggs, he can still csjole the
yokels in some remote spot on the uttermost
bounds of the land to reinstate him in Par-
liament, and thus the incubus which the
nation longs to shake off for ever is re-
imposed on her by the votes of a few deluded
bushmen, who are deceived by the glozing
tongue and brazen front of a man who
become a national disgrace, but under a new
policy schemes like this would become all
but impossible ; the decision of the people
would be final, and the politician whom they
had once dismissed could return to insult
them no more,.
#' * *
The only possible plea, for a continuance
of the present system is the necessity of
having local needs represented in the
Assembly, and when these are entrusted
entirely to local bodies and the Parliament
of the-nation ceases to be paroch’al scavenger
and parochial beadle to every tenth-rate
township in a huge coloby, it will be
hard to find one feasible argument in
defence of the policy which has reduced
the New South Wales Legislature to be-
neath the level of a menagerie. Under the
existing regime the Assembly at Sydney has
been swollen to absurd dimensions in the
effort to gratify every bush settlement by
providing it with a representative of its own,
and every member thinks it his duty to
block the business of the nation at large by
a grievance concerning the re-paintirg of the
local post-office ; or rises to dilate upon the
iniquity of the Government which declines
to remove the dead jackass from the main
thoroughfare at the cost of the State, and
wishes to know if the Treasurer will pay at
least half the expense involved in having
the carcase hauled away. The miserable
parochialism of the New South Wales Legis-
lature has made it the laughing-stock of
Australasia, but it is this same spirit of paro-
chialism which has crowded the Assembly
with the larrikin sand dirt-eaters of the colony,
and it is by buying this miserable horde in the
manner openly permitted by the law that
Sir Henry Parkes has ensured his long
ascendancy. The introduction of a radical
scheme of local government would end the
career of judicious and legalised log-rolling
which has supported him in the world of
politics for a generation, but so long as he is
in power such a scheme can hardly be hoped
for. Even the half-measure, which was
introduced a few months ago, was skilfully
crowded out by the Dead House scheme
and the project for embezzling the name of
Australia, and its future prospects are very
remote. The breath of Parliamentary re-
form would wither up the old Dictator in a
day. When there were no more roads and
bridges and deviations to be obtained, his
following of sycophants would dissolve like
snow, and, therefore, political purity must die
that Parkes may live.
The Skeletons at the Feast.
There is a skeleton at every feast. At the un-
veiling of Queen Victoria’s statue (it cost £5OOO
or so, and has, no doubt, been paid for out of
loan-funds or sales of the lands belonging to the
people of the hard-up colony of New South
Wales) there were four skeletons, and they were
duly introduced to the assembled multitude by
His Excellency Lord Carington, who said
In assisting at this ceremony of unveiling the Queen’s
statue, we are not only paying our tribute of personal re-
spect to the Sovereign of the greatest confederation which
the world has ever seen, but as loyal citizens and as Ihonest
men we are asserting a great principle. We are showing our
veneration for order, and we recognise that under a consti-
tutional sovereignty we have been able to obtain the greatest
amount of freedom which a country has ever enjoyed, with
the certainty that the weakest of us will he protected, and that
justice will be meted out to all alike, and that the laws made by
the people themselves will be administered without fear, parti-
ality, favour, or affection. Under the Queen s rule every
person in New South Wales knows that the powers of the
Executive are held in trust for the people, and that Ministers
ultimately are responsible to the people themselves for the exer.
else of those powers.
• • •
Considering the importance of the occasion
from an Imperial standpoint, Governor Caring -
ton’s speech was so commonplace that it would
have disgraced a schoolboy. But we do not write
this article merely for the purpose of directing
attention to the quality of the oratory which the
colonists get for the £30,000 they annually expend,
directly and indirectly, in maintaining in
magnificence the superficial, horsey man
about town who has been foisted on to
their treasury merely because he is a friend of the
Prince of Wale?. When Governor Carington
remarked at the outset of his speech that “as
honest men" they were asserting a great prin-
ciple, he went out of his way to insult the Rcpub*
iicana of Australia, who, by implication, are thus
alleged to be dishonest men ; “ loyalty ” to a throne
16,000 miles away is asserted to be the handmaiden
of rectitude. The rest of Governor Carington’b
speech clearly had reference to the one great
episode in his vice-regal career—the Mount
Rennie case—and was so interpreted, The Bul-
letin makes bold to aver, by 99 out of every 100
who heard the words fall from his lips or read the
newspaper-reports subsequently. The fact that
he should, on such an occasion, drag from the
grave the skeletons of the four wretched, igno-
rant boys whom he sent to the gallows in
deference to the brutality of the laws and the in-
direct influence of the ruling classes of a convict
colony which has not even yet emerged from be-
neath the shadow of the gaol-wall, argues that
Governor Carington, however little may be his
brain, possesses a conscience and is now troubled
in spirit. We do not wonder at it. He spoke of
“the weakest being protected.” He choked to
death, to protect the “ virtue ” of a street-walker,
four lads whose crime could not have been
punished with death in any other country under
the sun, and who were convicted after a trial the
manner of which—we say it for the hundredth
time, and will say it ten thousand times more—
was, and is, a disgrace to civilisation, and a his-
sing, burning brand of shame on the Supreme
Court of the colony which can never be effaced.
“ Justice will be meted out to all alike,” said
Governor Carington. Does Governor Caring,
ton know, or does he not know, that one of the
Mount Rennie convicts, whose guilt was possibly
greater than that of any of the others, and who
was reprieved, was the nephew of a Minister of
the Crown and a-cousin of a high official in the
Civil Service ? That another guilty Mount Rennie
convict, who was unaccountably reprieved, was an
illegitimate member of a rich Sydney family? and
that convicts are getting out of gaol every week
in the year simply because they have friends in
high places ?
* * •
“The laws made by the people them-
selves will be administered without fear, par-
tiality, favour, or affection.” Those, we happen
to remember, were the exact words used by
Governor Caring ton in his reply to the historic
deputation from the Sydney Exchange which
asked him almost in so many words to hang
four boys, all under 18 years of age ; so that
here would be another proof, if one were
needed, as to the groove in which his
lordship’s mind was running when he stood
up to eulogise the spirit in which the law is dis
pensed in Sydney. “ Ministers ultimately are re!
sponsible to the people themselves for the exercise
of the powers of the Executive.” This is untrue,
and nobody knows it as well as Governor Caring-
ton. The Imperial instructions to the Governor
under the Constitution Act are to the effect that
in all cases involving the execution of the sen-
tence of death, the Governor must first consult
the Executive Council, but, having done so, be
“is to act on his own responsibility alone." The
Executive Council was divided almost equally
over the Mount llennie case, yet the
Governor, on his own responsibility alone
(for he must have acted alone if he did
his duty according to his instructions),
sent four boys to the hangman. His PiLATK-like
attempt at self-vindication is a disastrous failure.
Governor Carington’s speech invites us to repeat
that since his arrival in Australia he has experi-
enced but one crisis which gave him an oppor-
tunity of proving whether he Was “ a man or a
mouse,” and in that crisis he, having a full and
complete and unfettered option, deliberately
elected to ‘uphold in defiance of the true principles
of British justice, the worst and most bloody of
the convict traditions of New South Wales.
* * •
The Bulletin does not choose to judge
Governor Carington by his nice moustache, or by
his well-flavoured claret-cup, or by the pawing of
his excellent horses, or by the hot-house delicacy
of the “ Society” refinement which prompted him
to order that the charming people from Potts
Point should not dance at Government House on
the night before the morning on which four boys
were to dance upon the air. Nor does it choose
to judge him altogether by the “goodness of
heart ” which prompts him to be very sorry (in
writing) whenever there is a fire at a shirt-shop.
1 he Bulletin has quite made up its mind about
a person who, being utterly inexperienced in the
administration of law and being utterly incom-
petent to debate or consider an abstract question,
accepts a position in which he has to arbitrate as
to the fate of citizens condemned to death—and
who, having taken his place as the representative
of a monarch alleged to be civilised and just and
merciful, signalises his advent by a decision which
fills the world with horror. We read that Boehm’S
statue of Queen Victoria looks “austere.” To
hear such a speech from Lord Carington was
enough to make the Fount of Mercy frown.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Gathering of the Official White Trash.
The difference between the genuine Australian
and the official white trash in Australia was
shown with more than usual distinctness at the
Centennial banquet given in Sydney Exhibition
Building on Thursday last. The gathering was
supposed to be commemorative of an event of
more or less importance in Australia's history,
but the speakers of the evening were almost all
foreigners and almost all foreign officials covered
with foreign orders and decorations, and their
talk was not of Australia, but of the little island
in the North Sea which sent them out to rule the
great Continent in the Southern Pacific. The
great debt which Australia owed to England, the


obligation upon Australia to support England in
her foreign wars and to mix herself up with Bul-
garian intrigues, Russian war-scares, Chinese
campaigns, Egyptian piracy, and Burmese mas-
-Bac-es, and to take over at cost price all the
accumulated moral leprosy of 1000 years of politi-
cal corruption ss a return for the generous gift of
a crowd of lags, the duty incumbent upon the
colonies to shore up England in order that she
might tear round Europe as she did in the days of
her earlier greatness, and many similar topics,
were dealt with in profusion, but the idea that
Australia could possibly have any rights of her
own apart from those which England chose to
confer upon her, seemed to occur to nobody pre-
sent. Sir Henry Loch struck the keynote of the
orgy by his definition of Imperial Federation—a
definition which, for artless simplicity, was worthy
of the heathen Chinee when properly opium-
soddened :
That distinguished statesman and patriot, the Right Hon.
W B DALLEY, and the Government of which he was a
member, took the first steo towards the establishment of a
federation such as that of which he spoke by dispatching
the contingent to Egypt, and the far-sighted policy which
had been adopted by the eminent statesmen of this great
enlnnv and other colonies and the action ef the several Par-
liaments in passing the Naval Defence Act formed a second
great step towards the accomplishment of the same end.
Federation, in the gospel according to Loch,
means the privilege of every true Australian to
sink his soul to perdition by murdering at his own
expense any unhappy heathen towards whom
Britain entertains a grudge. This view of the
‘ case is a point lower in the scale of common-
sense than that which defined freedom aa the
right of every man to wallop his own nigger, but
then nobody expects common-sense in a Governor.
Futhermore, the outpost of British Imperialism
spread himself as follows ;
Never in the history of the Empire had it been more im-
nortant than at the present moment that the mother country
and the colonies should stand together with a steady front,
with the great powers of Europe armed to the teeth and
standing face to face.
Some day Australia will shake herself free from
Britain, and then the Great Powers of Europe
may stand face to face until they have to sit down
from sheer weariness without'this country being
aftectedin the slightest degree. Next Sir An-
thony Musgravk took up the parable :
He was quite sure that the younger colonies in the group
would follow the lead of the mother colony in any effort she
might make to consolidate the strpngth of Australia, and to
cement her union into one solid block iu that gieat Empire
whose drumbeat, that gre.t orator, Daniel Webster, said, is
heaid following the rising sun and keeps time with the hour.
Australia has no desire to become a “ block,” but
all the assembled official white trash burst out in
imbecile cheers at the prospect, and hoorayed
themselves hoarse in honour of the good time
coming. Then Parkes grovelled on a new basis :
We are, in fact, so many republics without the dangerous
polity of a real republic. (Hear, hear.) We have in the
temperate monarchy of the iresent day a greater freedom
than we ever could enjoy in any form of republican govern-
ment known in the world. The bonds that unite us to the
Imperial power are bonds of silk. The bonds that are to
unite us together must he made of steel.
Here the man for whom the school children’s
pennies are being cadged struck an unconscious
truth. Australia has not the “dangerous polity
of a real republic,” for the simple reason that she
is neither a Republic nor a Kingdom, nor even a
nation, but only a Spot, and as the Acts of her
Parliaments are subject to the approval of the
cast-off politicians whom Britain sends out to boss
her institutions, with an appeal to the Crown as a
further stumbling-block to progress, she has only
such a polity as England thinks fit to allow when
she is quite rested, and has time to think of Aus-
tralia at all. But Sir Henry glided off this
dangerous ground to demand a general
conscription of all the young men in Australia
for the purpose of rolling back the tide of war
when Britain brings down some horde cf Tartar
savages upon our shores. Then the band played
“Home, Sweet Home,” and Sir Frederick
Darley rose to sound the lowest note of worse
than Chinese degradation by describing Aus-
tralasia, Canada, and all the rest of the colonies
as “ England’s provinces,” and the aggregation of,
foreign white trash, who insolently posed as the
representatives of Australia, departed on their
well-fed way. Even Australia’s celebrations are
conducted by foreigners, and when she wants to
rejoice she is only allowed to pay English officials
to rejoice for her.
*
The Peer and the Chinaman.
The British tourist who totters for a few days
round the shores of Australia—who looks in at
one or two cities, and then imagines that he has
gained a full insight into the entire social system
of the Continent—is a nuisance which we have
always with us. Froude did this, and then
poured forth the superhuman gall of his ignorance
in print, with a result that will be remembered
long after bis other doings are forgotten, and now
Lord Brassey, with more gall and less brains, is
following in his footsteps. Last week he took the
chair before a gaping audience at Exeter Hall,
London, the place which has so long been asso-
ciated with the sky-pilot and the missionary, or,
as the Frenchmen justly term him, the copra
apostle, and there, supported by an ignoramus
named Watt, he assured his audience that the
great want of the Northern Territory of Australia
was Chinamen. If Australia is to be saved, ac-
cording to the man with the half-crown yacht,
she must have lepers, and must have them in
droves. The trading Englishman, of whom
Brassey is a melancholy type, ia so much accus-
tomed to see a land crowded with human beings
until there is scarcely air or standing room for the
stifling multitude that he looks upon the great
solitudes which are still to be found in portions of
Australia as a blight upon the earth, and he
straightway calls for human rubbish to shoot into
the primeval wilderness, to defile the streams
and turn the cataracts into sewers. He thirsts to
build slums upon the oases, and plant gaols and
breweries in the valleys, and grog-shops upon a
thousand hills. The great lone wilderness is to
him only a favourable location on which to dump
down a dirty city with a dog-fight at every corner,
and a cesspool in every back yard, and when he
looks upon the wide plains with their fringe of
blue hills on the far horizon, and learns that there
are not at present enough white men to fill them
up be wants to know why Chinamen can’t be im-
ported to keep the silent places of God’s earth
from going to seed, lie views the great, mysteri-
ous wilds With shop in his soul, and is grieved to
learn that they don’t pay any dividends; he
stands on the fringe of the vast Unknown and
urges that a soap-factory should be built on it,
and he would fain cork the cascades to prevent
them running to waste. Probably no one ever
yet mistook Brassey for a child of song, the
shovel and wheelbarrow cf his sire have entered
into his gilded soul too deeply J,o make such an
error possible—bun if any one conceived the pos-
sibility of some glimpse of poetic fancy being
hidden behind that dull exterior the pitiful
sordidness of the proposal to flood Aus-
tralia with Mongols, and turn the Northern
Territory into a vast lazaretto for com-
mercial ends will dispel it for ever. The
greasily pious habitues of Exeter Hall no doubt
hailed the suggestion with applause, and looked
forward to the time when the white man and the
Chow would lie down together in the tropics,
and when the soul of the latter would be upheaved
by association with the soidisant Christian, but the
Australian has different views, and in this matter he
will either have his own way or something will be
heard to drop at an early date.
Centennial Gas.
Very reaently an agitation went abroad through-
out the length and breadth of New South Wales
for a Centennial christening, and men clamoured
and the heathen raged for a change in their coun-
try's cognomen. In view of the development of
fire-worship, which seems gradually to have
grown up since the advent of fireworks in the
Sydney Domain, New South Wales might not
unjustly call herself Terra Dei Fuego, or the land
of imitation Sheoi. The genuine article wouldn’t
mind, and the Terra Del Fuegans call their ash-
plot by a native name, and do not appreciate the
Christian-bestowed appellation of their country.
Whenever Australia wants to jubilate, or centen-
niate, or celebrate in any fashion whatsoever, she
turns on the gas and puts the meter on an infernal
spree, and while the people go mad with loyalty,
hydrogen runs riot in the gasometer and goes in for
an intangible drunk. Gas is the medium for in-
toxicating merriment, and vapour the legitimate
channel for sentiment. Gas, verbal and hydro-
genic, rules the roost and fills the atmosphere,
and it is a difficult thing to make out where one
sort of gas leaves off and the other begins.
Considered in the light of a locomotory gaso-
meter, Sir Henry Parkbs, Q.C.M.G, pretty
well fills the bill, but he is a hard-raced
reservoir when the ornamental warrior from
Manly is around clamouring for a union of the
English ; speaking people, or a titled British
Minister out of a billet is endeavouring to
persuade callow Australians of the beauty and
holiness of Imperial Federation. But it is with
the gas manufactured in Kent-street, Sydney, that
we have at present to deal, and during the recent
Centennial shivoo vapour of another brand, to
wit, the north-easterly wind, had it all its own
way, and distanced t he artificial lightning agency
hands down. The intended-to-be most resplendent
spectacle of the Centenary, Captain look's
statue, was a dark and dismal failure. Behind
the framework erected to carry the lamps, Cook
looked like an imprisoned Magog in a canary-
cage, and his galley-fires didn’t gleam worth a
cent. The Queen’s recently up-tilted effigy of
bilious-tinted bronze was a similar massive
disaster, and the Town Hall was a ghastly monu-
ment of adermanic endeavour after fiery loveli-
ness, sprinkled with spasmodic fireflies, and
pimply in spots with Chinese lanterns. In fact,
all the illuminations which faced the wind were
dismally out of it, for the main reason that they
were right in the teeth of it. Long rows of
flameless fairy-lamps hung like strings of
strangled convicts from the trees in the parks,
with here and there a sickly glint like a stab in
the vital part of the night. The doctors in
College-street managed to get up a show of harle-
quin-coloured magnificence, which somewhat re-
lieved the tombful blackness of Hyde Park, and
lighted up the way to the cold and silent sarco
phagus. The doctors’ lamps threw their medi-
cine-tinctured radiance across the wilderne=s of
life, and reminded one cheerfully of the sweet and
gentle corpse-lights that lend their gilded glamour
to the grave. The Exchange, which boasted the
best show in Jubilee session, wag illuminated
mostly by the pungent perfume of escaping gas
and was considerably appreciated by the crowd,
as their wheezing breaths and hacking coughs
amply testified. The City Bank, out of the eye of.
the wind, was a fair success, but the illuminatory
palm was annexed by the offices of the “ Pic-
turesque Atlas” Company, which radiated in elec-
tric, splendour driven by special machinery, and
against f be electric beam the wind was absolutely
powerless, of course. Of transparencies there
were many, and ii CiloK didn’t turn in his grave
at the pictorial libels over nian«ino, he is made of
stuff stem enough to discover a new AiictrpHa
beyond the regions of actuality and gas. Some of
the old Jubilee “ daubs ” were trotted out, no
doubt under an impression that Queen Victoria
had a hand in the manufacture of this Continent.
One white-skulled spread of ochre and calico, re-
presenting her Maj esty, bore the legend, flanking the
awful caricature of regality, “ Long may she reign;
peace on earth; goodwill to men.’’ Evidently, in
the designer’s opinion, there is an intimate con-
nection between the Queen and the Deity, and
that sovereign-worship is a sure guarantee of a
good harvest in the autumn. The Clubs, being
nearly all on the wrong side, were promptly
squelched by the north-easterly, and represented
in their total dreariness a black frost of a very
decided character. Everywhere Chinese lanterns
tried to look lovely, and beautifully illustrated the
bond of federal union subsisting between Austra-
lia and the Empire of the saffron pup. This pub-
lic recognition of the Yellow Agony is, no doubt,
an act of gratitude to John Chinaman for the
recent advancement of Mandarin Parkes to the
dignity of a Celestial subject. Flags, mainly
also of a Chinese origin, bannerets, &c., fringed
the street and presented the appearance of a string
of dressmaker’s remnants hung out as samples
for patch-work quilts. The display of bunting was
cheap and tawdry, and gave a poor impression
of the resources of the Calico Jemmies’ shops,
which “boss” the glorious Freetrade colony.
The pasteboard and chintz-curtain arches were
too flimsy to sustain a modicum of respect, and
deposited most of their painted paper on the pave*
ments before the affair began to eventuate.
Oxford-street went off in a paroxysm of Centen-
nial fervour and effrondesced in an arch of
withered green-meat, upon which was proudly
printed, “ Oxford-street’s Tribute to the Centen
nlal,” but it was like the people of New South
Wales’ tribute to the Parkes Fund—-a multy
failure. On the reverse was another legend,
“ May Oxford-street Flourish.” Judging from
this, we understand that all the rest of Australia
may go to pot, New South Wales may bust up,
Sydney in general may be burned down, and the
streets leading off Oxford-street may sit in sack-
cloth and ashes so long as Oxford-street iteelf
holds up. Another triumphal signment yearned
after a continuance of “Unity,” while the final
erection of verdancy in this radiant locality bore
the mysterious line, “Long May He Live,” but
who the he was the centenniators neglected to
explain—it surely couldn’t have been the sucking-
pig with the lemon in its mouth on the marble
slab below. A sma’l picture of a bronze-skinned
navigator hung above the motto, and possibly
represented the he. During our Centennial ramble
on the night of the 26th January Oxford-street
was enlivened by the sounds of a hammer, and
through an open door we espied a Centennial
undertaker busily engaged in covering with sable
cloth a Centennial coffin. This is so apt and
lugubrious a practical moral to the whole cele-
bration that we think we will say no more about
the business.

Ike Silver Boom : A Word l» Season.
The following, which we out from the Journal
of Commerce, a well-conducted, but as yet
obscure Melbourne weekly, is worth chewing
over. The figures on which the Journal’s com-
ments are based are taken from the Broken Hill
Co.’s balance-sheet. Would it not be as wt 11 for
the shareholders to climb down before the crash
comes:—
The central point of all the recent speculation has been
the Broken Hill Proprietary Oomoany. Now, fortunately,
this company, as befits its importance, has just issued in
a handsome manner its balance-sheet, statement of
accounts, and reports of directors and officials for the half-
year ending 30th November, 1887, and we are, therefore,
enabled to obtain some data for our contention that the
prices now being paid are beyond all reason. The extensive
work being done on this proprietary is shown by the fact
that no less than 898 men are employed, whose wages and
salaries for the six months absorbed £53,014 Bs. 31. During
the half-year 28,800 tons of ore were raised, at a cost
of £1 3s. 7d. per ton. The cost of smelting same was
£2 12a. 4d per ton, or a gross amount, including
£4182 13s. 6d. for depreciation, of £76,303 3s 7d This ore
yielded 6550 tons 9;wt 2qrs. 171bs. cf bullion, of which
1,267,699 <za. were fine silver, at an average of 44.110z5. to the
ton, and 6511 tons 13cwt. lllbs of had. These figures
show an expansion of the yield of silver of more than three
times over the output for the corresponding sis months
ending November, 1886 ; but it is noteworthy that during
that period >he average of fine silver to the ton was 83 83, or
very nearly twice the average given t®he present ore. This
is a point worthy of note, because If'would seem to show
that there is a great falling off in tha richness of the mine.
When, however, we come to the working expenses, we are
positively appalled at the money absorbed. Thus, during
the six months silver shipments and value of bullion at
mine represent £300.739 17s 61., and yet only £96,000 baa
been paid in dividends. The expenditure has been £177,384
16s. 5d.. including wages as previously -tat.ert; freight on
coke, £18,132 17s. 7d ; do. on bullion, £26,456 13a. 61 ; and
expenses floating Blocks 15 and 16 in London, £lBB4 10s.
The net profit for the six months was £l2O 201 5s 5d , the
total amount of assets, after about £BOOO had been written
off for depreciation of plant and buildings, being £410,389
16s. 81. The dividends for the last month have been £llos.
per share of £2O, of which £l9 is paid up; or, presuming
that the same amount he paid monthy, £lB per annum
—a good, hut not, as mining properties aie expected to
yield, an extravagant return for the investment; and yet these
said shares have been sold on the market for £290 each, the
return being thus equal to only 6i pec cent, per annum, while
the value of the mine, in which tnere are 16 000 shares, has
increased to £4.640,000 sterling ! Is there anybody who will
have the courage to aver that there is anything in the in-
trinsic value of this property, as shown by the yield, not for-
getting the great expense in working, or in the dividends, to
justify such a premium being paid for its shares ? It Is true,
of course, that there is something—about £33 per share, it is
estimated —to be distributed from the proceeds of the sale of
Blocks 15 and 16 to the British Broken Hid Proprietary Co ,
although on this ptint the directors are strangely reticent,
debiting the expenses of flotation, but on!y rem arsing in
their report, “ By this sale the shareholders in this (the
parent) company are entitled to and will receive for every
share held by them five fully paid-up shares in the British
company. There will also be receivable a cash bonus for
every share held in this company; but your directors, pend-
ing further and more particular advices from London, are
unable to determine the exact amount thereof." This biief
resume cf the affairs of the chief silver mining company in
the colonies will, we think, thoroughly support the position
we have taken up. It is appirently well managed, is in fall
work, and every care seems to have been taken to provide
for depreciation and probable losses, ana yet so great is the
expense of working that only 30s. per month, or 6} per cent,
on the market piice of the stock, is being returned ia divi-
dends. There may not be any positive danger in this case;
but what shall we say of other ventures, for which £lO,OOO
to £20,000 is asked by promoters, the capital of v hich has
eagerly been subscribed by the public, and the shares run up
tothiee times their par value, yet no work beyond pros-
pecting, or even provisionally securing the ground, has been
done? The action of speculators in regard to such ia worse
than folly ; it is almost criminal recklessness, for there is
hardly a tenth of them whose own means would be sufficient
to provide for a collapse, should such happen, and then their
families, creditors, and the community generally would most
assuredly suffer.

Balaam ail a Feed.
The Centennial Press banquet given in Sydney
Town Hall last week brought to light a new phase
of Parkes’ ignorance. He never reads The
Bulletin. He used to read it, however, or else
some one who was more competent to tackle the
long words read it for him ; but, apparently, he
has changed since then, and endeavours, from a
literary point of view, to keep himself undeflled.
A few years ago a well-known New South Wales
politician, whom Parkes had assisted in raising
to high office, departed from this state of exist-
ence, and The Bulletin stated that among his
papers were found one or more of Parkes’ pro-
missory notes, which showed that he had accom-
modated the great Hi- Ham with cash advances.
This assertion evoked an indignant denial, and,
as the denial purported to come direct from the
hand of Parkes, we presumed at that time that
he read 1 he Bulletin. Sir Henry’s latest in-
solvency schedule, however, showed that the
indebtedness m question had existed, even
if no pr. missory notes had btea given,
so it is possible that the “Jesuitical” statement
in ques ion did not emanate from the Man of Jb air,
and that he didn’t read The Bulletin, after all.
The reason of this neglect on his part to gather
useful knowledge deserves to be given in his own
words :
He (Sir Henry) did not intend to go much further on this
track. (A voice: “What about The Bulletin ?’) Well,
as someone had interjected the name of a newspaper, he
might as well tell them a law of his life which excluded the
particular paper mentioned from ever coming under his notice
He never saw the paper. He had made up his mind for many
years never to read a paper that once attacked private character.
(Cheers.) This was no vain boast. His life was of more
value to him, his time was of more value to him, and he
would not either waste his life or his time by reading the in-
temperate vapourings of any set of persons who did not
respect the truth. . . It was essential to the well-being of
a free state that they should have a free and thoroughly
independent press.
From these remarks we presume that the cham-
pion Billingsgater of New South Wales is about to
reform and mend his ways. A few years ago he
screamed out to an audience which declined to
wholly accept his views on current politics, that
they were a gathering of “ Thieves, crimps, and
blacklegs”; a few months ago he cursed an in-
offensive political opponent as a “ mole eyed
nonentity,” and another as a “craven-spirited,
poodle-headed, creeping creature.” a “ withered
tarantula,” an object with an “extraordinary
face’’and “spread-eagle whiskers”; he deluged
the Assembly with such choice expressions as
“ liar ” and “ coward,” and stood by nnreprovingly
while his ob’dient followers filled the colony with
such “attack son private character” as it had never
before heard, even in the days when drunken lags
were raging through the streets of Sydney. But
even while he was heaving cuss epithets at the
public, such as the hangman of last century used
to throw at the early convicts, and discharging the
language of the bottomless pit at everyone who
would not bow to his ignorance and insolence, he
never never sank so low as to read The Bulletin.
Even when he went to Bathurst for the purpose
of blasting the reputation of his opponent, Mr.
Suttor, and denounced him from the platform in
the name of all the gods of Brummagem, the in-
nate nobility of bis soul prevented him from beg-
ging or borrowing a paper “ which once attacked
private character.” He admires, it is true, a
“thoroughly free and independent press,” but the
kind of independent press which he worships is one
which is dragged captive at the chariot-wheels of
Henry Parkes. Very recently that man of many
insolvencies declared with the emphasis for which
he is so famous that he had neither part nor lot
in the infamous Treason Felony A ct which for
several years disgraced the Statute-book of New
South Wales, and The Bulletin inquired, in
Addisonian '"diction, calling foim
either a thief, a crimp, or a black-leg, why, under
such circumstances, he had held office in the
Ministry which enacted that hideous atrocity, and
why the records of the Assembly showed that he
had supported it through all its stages. A a
Parkbs never reads Thb Bulletin it is just pos-
sible that the question escaped his notice, which
may account for the fact that he has never ten-
dered any explanation about this awful discrep-
ancy. But so long as Sir Henry’s own facts
hang together so loosely we would ask him, as a
favour, not to rave too wildly about the “ intem-
perate vapourings of any set of persons who do nob
regard the truth.” In connection with the afore-
said Treason-Felony Act, The Bulletin made a
stupendous effort to extract one truth—only one
—from Pahkes, and it is still waiting vainly for
a reply. The great Hi-Ham has since then
supplied many heavy facts upon a great variety
of subjects, but with regard to the one matter on
which we asked for enlightenment he has kept
strictly dark, and if the perennial supply of vera-
city should ever fail in this office we can only re-
mind him that we are still waiting for the ex-
planation which is so long coming.
Mr. M ‘Millan, of Sydney, Freetrader andM.L. A.,
raises a fresh aspect of the Imperial Federation
question in a communication to the Sydney D.T.
The question has already been argued on many
different bases, buteven on this well-trodden ground
the softgoodsman of York-street has contrived to
strike a new reef: —
If we were separated from the mother country, would Ger-
many allow such a large and valuable territory as Western
Australia to remain in the hands of a tew millions on this
side of the continent, who have really no claim upon it, and
who have done nothing to develop its great resources 1 And
by what right, except that of British discovery and British
occupation, could it possibly be hell? But once let the
British element disappear and all right to its integrity as a
portion t f our inheritance goes.
The question naturally arises at this juncture—
If the Australians who occupy Western Australia,
in so far as it is occupied, have no right to that
territory, what possible right can be put forth by
Englishmen 16,000 miles away, who do not occupy
it at all? Or if “British occupation” in the
shape of about a dozen officials confers a title to
the land why does not Australian occupation by,
say, 30,000 people confer a better title by arith-
metical ratio. Hitherto it has been understood
by civilised nations that the inhabitants of a land
had the best claim to be its rulers, but in the new
gospel according to M‘a4illan, the West Austra-
lians are a peculiar race who have no right even
to standing room on this earth, and who
in equity ought to be crowded into the sea.
And if the West Australian has no rights as a
human being on his own account and apart from
Britain, we presume the Queenslander and the
Victorian would also sink into mere outcasts
should British protection be withdrawn from
them. There are a good many other points in
Mr. M'Millan’s weird communication, but after
thus defining the Australian colonist as a land-
less pariah, the rest of the softgoodsman’s argu-
ments sink into insignificance.

The Earl of Carnarvon has been making a Cen-
tennial ass of himself, and even the Sydney
Morning Herald is compelled to admit this anti-
imperial fact. While allowing that the sleepy
old nobleman “was very happy in the remarks
he made to show that England as well as Austra-
lia has an interest in these celebrations,” the
Hunter-street megatherium is careful to draw the
line of elastic veracity somewhere between Sirius
and eternity. Thus the Herald :
When Lord Carnarvon says, on behalf of the mother-
country, that her children in New South Wales are as dear
to her as those who people the British Ides, the thought that
he is carried away by enthusiasm necessarily intrudes.
No, dear though antiquated sibyl of paleozoic
platitudes, it is not a word ending in “ asm ” but
“ ism ” by which the gentleman is carried away,
and it is that word so precious to your silt-
deposited, post-prinary, fossilised old heart —Im-
perialism. When further along in the same par.
you say that Australia is “cared for at home,”
there is, as you pithily put it, “no doubt” about
it either. We will go to a greater extent in our
agreement with you. You say, “It is simply a
question of degree.” Bight, ancestress of the
Devonian mammoth and grandmother of An-
tiquity, “it is simply a question of degree.” Just
in proportion as we become valuable to Great
Britain —or to speak more correctly, the English
holders of Australian stock —so also in exactly
similar proportion shall we be “ cared for at
home.” Our troubles just arrive from that
“ care.” We should care less if England didn’t
“ care ” for us so much, and you cm lay your
venerable old bools on that, granny!
♦
Says the cultured S.M. Herald, in a leading
article :
Anything that is coarse or brutal would shock the feelings
of the Australian people as quickly as it would the people of
any other part cf the world. Scenes that have been per-
mitted in America, or on the Continent of Europe, would
net be tolerated here.
This heavy utterance comes well from the stolid
organ of that Legislative Council which is the
hereditary upholder of the triangles and the cat!
If “ America or the Continent of Europe” could
see into a Sydney gaol-yard when some hapless
madman is being flayed alive on the authority nob
of a judge and jury, but of an irritable beak who
has been drunk at the club until four o’clock in the
morning of the day upon which he sits in majesty
to vindicate the convict traditions of New South
Wales, they would regard the Australian people
who suffer this to be — for the people can abolish
the cat and the triangles if they will—as lower
than Bosjesmen and more brutal than brutes.
For a |lorg time the existence of leprosy in
Europe has been carefully hidden from the outside
public, but at last it has been placed beyond
doubt that the loathsome Chinaman has sent this
speciality of his into almost every country, from
the Urals to the Atlantic. The great French
physician, Dr. Besmer, has also proved that the
disease spreads by contagion—in fact, it is slowly
spreading wherever it has gained a foothold.
Speaking of the Mongol pestilence and the disease
which fellows these unclean aliens like a shadow
wherever they tread, a London paper says :
They have carried it to California, New Brunswick, the
Cape of Good Hope, and the Sandwich Islands, where it was
previously unknown ; and either they have brought it into
Europe themselves, or it has been brought by Europeans
who have been in contact with them. All the specialists in
skin disease in Paris are said to have lepers among their
patients—soldiers, sailors, merchants, sisters of charity, mis-
sionaries, and others. Epidemics of leprosy have broken out
in more than one of the provinces of Spain, the disease hav-
ing been brought home by sailors. There are lepers in the
hospitals of London, Dublin, and Glasgow; and Archdeacon
Wright mentions, on authority he does not doubt, that a
week or two ago there was a case of leprosy in an English
village.
apparently, the disease has gained a stronger
hold in the dark places of Europe than in Aus-
tralia, but some day the presence of the still-
to’era ted John will result in an epidemic in these
colonies, and when the Australians see lepers in
the Church and the Legislature and lepers prac-
tising at the Bar and serving drinks in the public-
houses they may possibly wake up to realise the
full dimensions of their own stupendous folly.


HISTORY OF BOTANY BAY.
Besides these attempted escapes by land
and sea, the convicts tried to break their fetters
by rebellion. Goaded to desperation as they were
by the brutality of their gaolers, and with the
utter hopelessness of their abandonment perpetu-
ally staring them in the face, it was but natural
that convict flesh and blood should mutiny.
Isolated cases of assigned servants rising against
their mas:ers are numerous. In a moment of
natural self assertion a convict might -itrike his
master or overseer. It would not be long before
he found himself triced up to the triangles, and
tortured until the capricious vengeance of bis vic-
tim was entirely glutted. He would be cut down
with murder in his heart, and it would not be
long before the body of his tyrant would be found
lying about, while a new bushranger would take
to the bush. Instances of the kind might be mul-
tiplied endlessly.
* * *
Tne first mention of an organised move-
ment among the convicts was in 1796, They
began to complain with fastidious particularity
that the record of their conviction and sentence
had not been brought out with them. They
clamoured for this luxurious attention, as if it
mattered to their gaolers whether they carried
their chains for five or fifty years. However, as we
have seen, the matter received attention at home,
on the Governor’s representations. In 1800,
Governor King began to complain of the Irish
political prisoners. They appear to have objected
to the treatment the thieves and felons were sub-
jected to. King complained to the home authori-
ties of “ the restless disposition of these people,
which has not a little been aggravated by the
artifices of Harold, the priest.” There appears to
have been absolutely no other foundation for the
reported conspiracy than is found in the following
from Barrington’s history : —‘ ‘ A convict who had,
with great earnestness, propagated a report that
many pikes had been secretly made, and, to pre-
vent detection, sunk in a well-known part of the
harbour, was examined. This fellow, on being
examined by the magistrates, confessed he knew
nothing of what he had stated, and said he was
Intoxicated at the time. For this he was severely
punished.” Harold, the priest, was examined,
but “ nothing appeared to criminate him.” A
general search was made among the persons sus-
pected, in all parts of the colony at the same time ;
“ the examination took place on the lath, but
nothing was discovered that could furnish
the smallest evidence of the reported oximes. ’
But this did not prevent wholesale flog-
gings taking place in all directions to ex-
tract information. Under the influence of
abject terror, some soared wretches invented
stories, but they contradicted each other and were
flogged for their pains, while others were sent to
Norfolk Island without trial, and, here, again, it is
strange to note how our history repeats itself.
Since the introduction of Responsible Government
we have seen a New South Wales Premier excite
a similar scare, and call the dead from the grave
—in the shape of the Kiama Ghost—to prove
his slanders on a large section of the com-
munity. Our political leaders have studied
their politics, as they have their laws, in the old
convict records of the semi-savage and benighted
past.
* * *
Thomas Holt, whom we have so often
quoted, was one of the suspects on this occasion.
He was taken out of bed after midnight, and
brought from his place at Brush Farm to the gaol
in Sydney. He gives a picture of the gaoler :
“Mr. Daniel McKay, a person whose acquaint-
ance I did not covet, for he had been a transport
convicted of picking pockets. We do not attach
much mildness of character to the turnkey of a
gaol. It sometimes happens that a petty larceny
rascal, or even a felon, who has not been steeped
in the lowest dregs of villainy, may be so far re-
formed as to bo thought worthy of being one of
the many-headed dogs of a country gaol; a kind
of deputy devil, with eminent qualities as a tor-
mentor ; such a man, in comparison to Daniel
M’Kay, would have been thought worthy to be
made a member of a colonial Parliament, had
such a thing existed, or a justice of the peace, or
a judge.” The mantle of grim prophecy seems to
have fallen unawares on Mr. Holt. “ On my being
handed over to his keeping the following ensue 1 :
“ ‘ Weel, Master General Hoult, and you're wel-
come ; I’ll be teaching you a new exercise, for I
hae nae doot but ye’ll be hangit. and I wish ye
may, for weel ye deserve it,’
* * I asked him if there was any news; ho
answered, with a sneer, ‘ Oh, yes ; there be some
foe of your Irlshers to be hangit presently.’
This was very consoling, but Holt had enough
Influence to save him, by the merest accident,
from being hanged.
* * *
B ut the “ Rebellion of 1804, ’ as it is grandilo
quently termed by the fantastic creatures who call
themselves the historians cf Australia, was the
chief fiasco of this kind. A great many convicts
wore employed in the slave-gangs atout Castle
Hill, near Parramatta, and reports used to come
in that mischief was intended. Holt describe)
what was taking place, and he had every oppor
tunity of observing, as he exercised author! y in
the immediate neighbourhood. “ The lower
people,” he says, ‘convicts and others, bo.h
English and Irish, seeing their torment increasing
in this most ill-managed colony, conceived the
opinion that they could overpower the army, pos-
sess themselves of the settlement, and eventually
make their escape from it. Where they were to
go did not enter into the contain Ration of these
poor wretches, who fancied, at all events, they
could not be worse off than they were already.
Their numbers were contemptible, and their
means still more so; therefore, they must as
suredly fall and be hanged. I told them ” - [in re
sponse to solicitations to join them]—“l would
have nothing to do with the business, and if such
a scheme should be put into execution, I would
act on the side of the Government. Had I no
wife or children, and been disposed to take the
lead on this occasion, I could have made a short
job of it. The military were so careless and lax
in their discipline, that anyone of skill could have
formed a plan to surprise them, and m'ght have
taken magazine, army, and all in an hour.”
* * •
Informers and false swearers abounded in
the aattlement, and the officials soon neard of this
wild plot. When the convicts broke out on
March i, the Governor issued this —
“ Proclamation !
“ Whereas, a number of labouring convicts of
Castle Hill another part of this district have
assembled, and, in a rebellious and daring
manner, have attacked and robbed several of His
Majesty’s peaceable and loyal subjects of their
property and arms, and proceeded therewith to
great acts of outrages which the preservation of
the lives and property of his Majesty’s liege sub-
jects demand an immediate stop being put to by
the moat efficient means (sic).
“ I do, therefore, proclaim the districts of Parra-
matta, Castle Hill, Toongabbee, Prospect, Seven
and Baulkham Hills, the Hawkesbury, and the
Nepean to be in a
STATE OK REBELLION,
and do establish Martial Law throughout those
districts.” Then Major Johnstone set out with 40
soldiers and came up with the rebels at about
half-past 10 next morning. It is amusing to read
the various accounts of what took place. Says Major
Johnstone : “I rode up to them, accompanied by
one trooper (the emphasis is his own), and remon-
strated with them on the unpropriety of their
conduct, and desired them to surrender, which
they peremptorily refused. I went up a second
time with a trooper, and desired to speak with
their two leaders, who came up to ns, when we
forcibly drove them in to the detachments with
pistols at their heads ; the rest, to the number of
250, dispersed in every direction, and we have
been under the necessity of killing nine and
wounding a great many, the number we cannot
ascertain.” Toe Major, it will be seen, was a
military strategist of a high order. He just
hoisted oat a flag of truce, as it were, deluaed
two confiding wretches into trusting him, and
then drove them into the detachment with pistols
at their heads ! But there are other stories.
* • *
Holt heard frJ&i Mr. Cox another account.
The Major went up to Cunninghame, the leader,
and told him that if he had any real grievance he
would endeavour to get it redressed. “ Cunning-
hame advanced, took off his hat, and with it in
one hand and a sword in the ether, said, ‘ Death
or liberty !’ Johnstone made no attempt to molest
him, but Lay cock, who stood 6 feet 6 inches, a
quartermaster in his corps, came up and, with one
blow, killed Cunninghame on the spot. On this
the whole of the mob took to their heels, and
many were shot in the pursuit. ' This account
justifies the memory of the commanding officer so
far as to show that he tbok shelter behind his big
quarter-master, and only emerged in time to give
the order to fire on a huddled crowd of panic-
stricken men. There are one or two other ver-
sions, but they differ in no important particular,
'* * *
It was, doubtless, magnificent sport chas : ng
the flying rebels, of whom so many were wounded
that the Major did not take the trouble to count
them up. A good many got away, but the
soldiers succeeded in bagging a fairly good
catch. But if the chase was sport, and the
murder of flying men a delight and a ioy,
the real pleasure was tasted when the business
was over. When the pursuit was ended
those who were caught were brought before a
Court Martial. Under ordinary circumstances
this term associates itself in the mind with an as-
sembly of officers and gentlemen ; but it must be
borne in mind that the present use of the term
refers to a herd of gaolers and tradesmen wearing
the King’s uniform by accident. “It was arranged
that lots should be drawn from a hat,” for the
Court Martial found them all guilty, and the
soldiers could scarcely hang everybody ; “ and
that every third man whose name was drawn,
should be hanged. Many fine young men were
strung up like dogs, but the arrival of the
Governor put a stop to this extraordinary pro-
ceeding. Among those hanged, there was a
nephew of the Surgeon-general, Mr. Jamieson,
but this was kept, as far as it could be; a profound
secret.” This settled the fate of the Rebellion of
1804.
The Press Centennial Banquet.
“Hans Breitmann gife a barty,” and Alfred
Bennett, ambitious to entwine his name with
that of the illustrious Deutscher, has recently given
a square Centennial feed to the children of sin in
Australia, who live by concocting paragraphs and
chronicling tram-accidents. It was a good
thought on the part of the proprietors of the
Evening News and Gum and Downtreb Jernil
to secure a radical ad., and probably owed its
glittering conception to the massive brain cf
Henniker Heaton, the representativeo! Market-
street, Sydney, in the British House of Commons.
The Australian Press rolled up with all its deuble-
leaded dullnes® to get »n inspiration for a leader
on the Centenary from Bennett’s flz, and the
affair went off with the usual bilious buttering of
the real old marmalade/. post-prandial descrip-
tion. We never had a very exalted opinion of
the brilliancy of the country Press of Australia.
We have discovered no fresh reason for the
immediate manufacture of a new brand of senti-
ment in this connection. The ripe and crusty
orgacs of Capital were not there. The
Melbourne Age and Argus, the Sydney
Morning Herald and Daily Telegraph kept
studiously in the gloom of their own folding-
presses. The Bennetts had committed the un-
pardonable sin of hitting on a splendid notion for
advertising their prints. The self-styled leaders
of the Press in Melbourne and 8 ydney v ere green
with jealousy at the idea having escaped them.
Alfred deserves credit for his happy thought.
It was a bold strode for a big ad. He deserves
what he managed to secure—and he deserves no
more. There is no jealousy about us, We are
not small enough to grudge Alfred Bennett
the benefit of his enterprise, so we went. The
presence of Dr. Garran, one of the oldest and
ablest of Australian pressmen, lent a dignity to
the proceedings from which the absence of repre-
sentatives of the wealthy organs of noodledum
could in no way detract, fcir Henry Parkes
was very much there. The newly-created Grand
Commander of St. Muckall and St. Gorge mates
a blank in space wherever he is not. In the
gifted language of a Fouth Australian scribe, Sir
Henry had been “selected” by Alfred to pro-
pose the toast of the evening. “Selected”
is good. The toast of the evening was
“The Press,” and Sir Henry was “selected”
to propose it, probably with a view to
the eternal unfitness of things. Perhaps, too
Alfred considered it a good move to concil ate
the man who kept the gag so tightly on the mouth
of Minister for Works Sutherland, the Father
Christmas of the political aspirations of the News.
Anyhow, Parkes proposed the Press, and got an
opportunity, which he certainly didn’t throw
away, of insulting the Press afl round. He in-
sulted his host by buttering the S.M. Herald.
1 hat paper was unrepresented at the feed, no
doubt on the same principle that Parkes slanged
Dalley over the Soudan fizzle—namely, bee iuse
it was thought of by somebody else. Then
Parkes insulted the Herald. It was too care-
ful. It steered too far away from the meshes of
the libel law. This was a double-edged gibe.
The Premier sneered at a paper which respected
the laws his own Government imposed on a trust-
ing nation. He sneered also at the laws them-
selves and at the Government that manufactured
them. Like the hocus-pocus conjurers who terrify
a crowd with a piece of legerdemain, he put hia
tongue in his cheek and gave a wink that
signified the fire was only painted flame,
and the sword was one of pewter. Parkes
did not sneer at The Bulletin for steer-
ing clear of the law of libel. Our policy is
bounded on the North by the eternal truth, on the
South by the libel law, but its expansion Bast and
West does not recognise the compass. Then
Parkes gathered up his oratorical shirts and
“laid” for the Sydney D.T. He called it a paper
which occasionally published very Opportune
articles —the organ of “Opportunism.” The
Bulletin is never opportune, and, therefore, not
liked by the white-maned chief. He further in-
sulted the D.T. When it strayed into the border-
lands of sanity and published aught against the
denouncer of Milburn Creek, it was no longer “ a
free and hindependent paper. ’ Yes, oh, D.T.,
this is the verdict of your fetich ! The most
withering sarcasm he reserved for the paper
o wned by his host. When Parkes desires to
speak the brutal truth to suit his own purpose no
considerations cf common courtesy restrain him.
He not inaptly described the Evening News
as a paper with a large circulation. By
this we presume he meant a circulation
which never reaches its brain. Possibly
the gibe was the intenser in its bitterness as the
speaker reflected that the Empire of erstwhile
days never enjoyed such a circulation. That
ancient journal was hydrocephalous from its birth,
and died from water on the brain. Next Sir
Henry gratuitously informed them what a great
paper the Empire was, and, amidst interruptions
of “Eurasian! Eurasian!” told of his early
struggles with compositors, who subsequently en-
joyed the distinction of having their names in-
scribed upon a famous politician’s insolvency
schedule. After Sir Henry had resumed his seat,
a weary, dreary cart-load of journalistic flap-
doodle was shot out at his feet, until, in the
sickening whirligig of time, the host of the even-
ing took the floor. Mr. Bennett is greater in a
cartoon than as a speaker. He jerked out his
clumsy, bucolic rhetoric in spasmodic gasps of
bad grammar, and, like the gift?d scribes who had
spoken before him, slaughtered the English lan-
guage in a style which would have given satisfac-
tion to the soul of a Hottentot trying to express
himself in Anglo-Saxon. Alfred said that he had
given the feed, and he thought that the guests
ought to provide the speeches. Right! He re-
cognised that his mission in life was rather to
provide for a man’s gizzard, and leave to others the
task of providing for his brains. Then he floun-
dered along on the old Parkesian strain, and de-
nounced the compositor. The compo.’s days were
numbered. He looked forward to the time when
type should be set by a machine. A South Aus-
tralian man, who spoke afterwards, suggested
the heresy that a machine might he invented to
own a paper. Just here we would interject that
a machine has been invented for owning a paper.
Sir Henry Parkes, G.C.M.G.~we hope we have
not dropped a letter here, but it is one of those
things one cannot be sure about —appended his
gray-headed signature the other day to a minute
relating to the retirement of Civil Servants,
which laid down as an important principle the
axiom “ that the public service would be
strengthened by the retirement of officers over 60
years of age.” It was further determined in said
minute to suggest to such officers that they had
better vamoose the Civil Service ranch
while there was marrow enough in their
antiquated spindleshanks lo support them
en route to their respective firesides, and the
privacy of a family gruel-basin. This is probably
a step in the right direction. We say probably-,
because Parkes himself is 72 years of age, and,
though filling the highest position in the Civil
Service of his country, he has long passed that
age when he remembered to be civil without being
“ tipped” for it in the shape of a or
something. The question very naturally arises if
any man over 60 is not fit to lick a stamp, play
with red-tape, eat sandwiches over an office-
drawer, read the daily paper, talk about the
winner of the Cup, draw caricatures of the
Premier on a blotting-pad, yawn, purl his
moustache, remark that it’s ‘ ‘ deuced slow,
you know,” and “it’s blinded hot,” and “I
wonder how bloom, - g tong it will be before
it’s four o clock,” is he fit to rule a great, a pros-
perous, and an enlightened country under the
auspices of a resplendent ring of Freotrade huck-
sters and Calico Jemmies? Is he ? Parkes is kind
enough to remove these ancient Civil Service
mashers before they become uncivil servants,
before they shuffle off this mortal coil, and wander
round discharging their onerous duties with their
coffins on their backs, but why deesn’t he
remove himself ? Is it because there is
no retiring allowance, or is it because
there is nobody waiting for an “ advance ” ? It’s
all very well to fay there is nobody able to take
up the position if Parkes were to vacate it. That
is a matter of purely private opinion. Ask any of
the aspirants for the Premiership, and not one of
them will have a doubt about the matter. It
must be on account of that absence of a pension.
And, surely, should this be the true cause, after
all that Parkes has done to consolidate the party
of good Government and Freetrade, his numerous
admirers, the individuals whom his policy has
benefited and a generous and grateful nation,
would plank the money. Perhaps that is just what
Parkes is afraid of, that they would plank the
Dibits, and so he labours on.
W hen the Lewis Island crofters who went deer-
stalking were hauled before the judicial adversary
in Edinburgh, that individual, upon charging an
obedient-looking and apparently docile jury, said
that a verdict in favour of the accused would sap
the very foundation-stones and loosen the primary
cement of society, and the entire glittering fabric
would totter down about their law-abiding and
respectable ears, so they had better have a care,
and consider well what they were about. The
jury, feeling very much overburdened with the
awful weight of the existing condition of things
upon their shoulders, retired to think over the
spectacle of a tottering world and a chaosised
society, and wondered how it would look. Some
innovators, who had never had too much to eat,
thought that society wandering around promiscu-
ously, with its heels in the air and its coat on
hind-aide before, would be rather funny than
otherwise, and, moved by this humourous notion of
an inverted aspect of everything, brought in a
verdict in favour of the venison-raiding accused.
Nothing, however, happened, and society’s
foundation doesn’t appear to be sapped worth a
red cent, and if there are twelve. wretched
humourists in the world they live in Edinburgh,
and refuse to be comforted.

CORRESPONDENCE
Viator (Brisbane): Glad to receive farther
pars, from you,. . .Sizarac draws our attention
to the fact that the following versa was omitted from the
" Battle Hymn of the Republic," published in the Ceuten.
nial Bulletin:—
“ I have read a fiery Gospel, writ in burnished rows of steel,
As ye deal with my contemners so with you my grace shall
deal,
Let the Hero born of Woman crush the serpent with his
heel;
For God is marching on.”
.... A.H. (Manly): Rather tco small and thin and weak....
H.A. (Jeiilderie): Don’t get excited. The Bulletin
supports no creed whatever, and if it did lose sight of the
doings of some one-horse priest in a one-horse town, you
needn't revolve in your orbit at such a fearful rate about it.
We haven’t time or space to sit on every evil-doer. Don’t
part with your hair. We have to miss one now and then.
Be calm.,. .Australia (Bathurst); Your pen and ink sketches
are rather good in places. The horse's tail, for instance, is
admirably done... .H.O. (Bairnsdale, Yic.): We should say
that the paper in question has simply cadged the test stories
out of your contributions and published them in a slightly
altered form in order to get your work without payment.
There is such a thing as journalistic burglary, especially in
the office in question....A. Ockelford (Brisbane): The
Bulletin has always advocated Protection and Land
Nationalisation as parts of the same great programme, and
your extensive letter points the same way—only you don’t
know it. Freetrade, as you show, is reducing England to
poverty, while the system of private property in land, by
which the whole country is divided among a handful of men,
many of whom derive their holdings from ancestors who
paid not one cent for their ownership, intensifies the evil.
The total wealth of the country has suffered a tremendous
falling-off for want of seasonable Protection, and, as the
landlord bears hardly any share in the loss, it all falls on the
poorest cf the nation, and mak s them ten times poorer still.
It is true that Henry George is a Freetrader. But his Free,
trade is a corollary of his Land Nationalisation scheme....
Subsciibers (Culcairn): The yarn isa’t bad, but as exactly
the same thing is happening every hot day, it isn’t a particu-
larly fresh item by any means....J. Ward: The Newtown
electors must indeed have sunk low if they consent to ac-
cept as their representative the political godson of Mr.
Francis Abigail, director of a pawnshop which charges a
workman 250 per cent, for a loan on his horse and cart....
Walter Boughey : As to Parkes’ statement that he never
reads The Bulletin because it attacks private character,
we may remark that this expression of tender regard for
the sanctity of private character comes with excellent grace
from a man to whom a jury cf his fellow-countrymen on
two occasions refused to give that vindication they would
have accorded to any honest citizen. [Many communica-
tions unavoidably held over ]
Herr Most, the red-whiskered Anarchist of
America for whom personally we care not a brass
farthing and at whose execution we should notpro-
bably shed a single tear, applied recently for letters
of naturalisation in the i’nited States. He wanted
to be a Yankee citizen, and, in our humble opinion,
bad as he most undoubtedly is, he is good enough
for the situation In answer to a question as to
whether he would obey the laws, he replit d that
he would obey all go: d laws, but that he would
resist bad laws by force. The application for
papers was refused, and Herr Most went home
to supper an outlawed German invader instead of
a Yankee white-washed citizen. But the authori-
ties of the white starred and red-striped Republic,
by refusing the citizenship to Most on these
grounds, stultified themselves. In the first place,
by allowing Most’s objection, they' - admitted,that
“ bad laws” wire amongst the laws of the Union.
In the second place, by refusing to admit bis right
to resist “ bad laws” by force, they deprive them-
selves of any justification in regard to their own
armed resistance lo the “bad laws” of Eng-
land, when, as colonists, they threw the taxed tea
into Boston Harbour, and Washington un-
sheathed his sword against bis dear old “ mother
country.” For Most we arenotoutrageouslysirry.
We are, however, very much cut up on account of
the affrontthat Logic has received, and we consider
that every American should endeavour to make
his peace with that outraged deuy by a prayerful
syllogism put up night and morning, with a devo-
tional undistributed middle sung to a psalm-tune
at dinner-time. Had we been the American
authorities we should have admitted Most to
citizenship cheerfully, and just as cheerfully
hanged him if he broke any of our vital laws on
the ground that they were a’l good, and that he
was a bad judge of law.
The S.M. Herald toots the bugle of militarr re-
sponsibility, and gaily calls Australia to the fray.
Admitting, somewhat regretfully, that while
Great Britain has been engaged in little wars or
big wars Australia has, for one hundred “longi
beery years,” been steeped in ignoble and in'
glorious peace, it soothingly reminds that miser-
able and mutton-headed Continent that the con-
tinuance of such a state of affairs is hardly to be
expected much longer, and certainly tot in a cen-
tury to come, by which time, probably, the
Herald will be gathered to its fathers, and wOj
be warbling double-leffied leadeis to an empyreal
bass-drum on the succulent slopes of the glad For-
evermore. The dear old lady soporiflcally assures
Australia that this is a world of counterpoise and
compensation, and if it should be the fate of Aus-
tralia, during the century upon which it is novr
entering, to become the scene of war the “ evn
will not be unmixed with good.” Dearly beloved,
listen to your grandmother -
ThPre are some lessons which can only ba learned through
sacrifice and suffering. If war should come upon us, we c»-
not doubt as to fcbe ultimate result. We should incur low

But the people—the nation, shall we say . —would emerge
strengthened, sobered, possibly purified, by a trial wWWj

Great heavens! think of that! It is too muon
joy for the meritless Australia. Let us go to war
at once, we want “ sobering ” badly after tbi&
long Centennial drunk, and perhaps, too, PakK®°

“ The Life and Death of Captain Cook,”
a drama -which purports to reveal the mortal career
of the early navigator and the circumstances
which led to him winding up his business at an
early age and retiring among the golden harpists,
has been put on at Sydney Gaiety by way of cele-
brating the Centenary. It is a sorrowful show in
many respects, and worthy of the occasion. We
were never personally acquainted with Cook, but
we are prepared to swear that unless he was a
much larger ass than the world takes him for he
never spouted all the copy-book precepts which
have been crowded into the proceedings at the
Gaiety. No less than three times in one scene he
says that “ a lime will come,” and in the next
scene he strikes another attitude and says twice
that “ the time has come.” People don’t go on
like that in real life, and the author might do
well to make a note of it. But while that part of
the drama which Is Cook is weak enough, the
part which is not Cook is worse still. There
wasn’t near enough Cook to fill up the five acts
and the prolcgue, and so the story is padded out
with the old, burning, extensive gag about the
wicked squire with two or more wives, which was
first invented by some literary clam filled with in-
comparable rot a thousand years ago. In the
opinion of a certain class of dramatists, a play
without a wicked squire la sadder than home
without a mother, though why the unprin-
cipled automaton should always have married
a second-rate girl in early life and then
deserted her in London and started out on a
career of bigamy, with a view to blighting the
prospects of another girl who is in love with a
good young man of humble birth, which latter
the squire endeavours to destroy through the
malign agency of a ruffian whose solitary
suspender is held on to his pants by a long nail,
and who comes up behind the good young man
while he is musing on front of his mother’s grave,
that lady having died while he was away, is an
unwholesome question in which we have never
cared to enter. This kind of drama would col-
lapse utterly it the nail which holds up the
assassin’s solitary suspender chanced to come
away just when ha was crawling up behind the
hero who is musing beside his mother’s grave, as
that circumstance would make him fall over his
own pants, and the nois3 of his downfall would
make the benevolent character of the story turn
round and seize him by the hair, and then he
would confess all, and the hero would go away
and explain the whole affair to the girl, and at
this crisis Ihe wicked squire’s deserted wife
would appear round the corner on her return
from London, and everything would be cleared
up. If the men who write such dramas as
“ Captain Cook ” wou'd study this aspect of the
case and sew some buttons on the only reliable
garment of the first murderer, their work
would rest on a much more secure
basis than it does at present. The long-
drawn out sorrow of Co uk is relieved a lot, how-
ever, by the acting. Mr. Dampier as Ban Rattlin
keeps up his reputation as the beso and most
versatile of Australian actors. No matter
whether he plays Mephistopheles, Hamlet, or Mac-
beth, or whether he represents a battered sailor or
a hungry tramp full of strange oaths and gin, he
is always a success and while his representation
of the magnificent demon in “Faust” is known
as one of the finest on the Australian stage he is
equally at home in melod ama, in which depart-
ment he has saved many a misguided author
from the effects of his own dark and dreadsome
drivel. Captain Cook himself is ably held up by
Mr. Boothman, and Miss Lily Dampier makes a
good show in the part of a saddening heroine.
Some remarks regarding the other characters,
who have the misfortune to be in this piece, are
regretfully held over till next week,

The “ Forty Thieves ” were put on the
stage at Sydney Cii'etion on Sa’ui day night, but
when the one who represents thh paper went up
to view the proceedings of the other 39 behind
the footlights he was informed that no seats had
been reserved ftr the press, and that the taber-
nacle was full up. Possibly the management
thought their show was worth standing on alter-
nate legs all the evening tj see, but Th e Bulletin
critic has already made the acquaintance of more
thieves than would fill the whole Cr.tarion, and
the prospect of beirg introduc d to 40 more did
not seem worth the trouble. Consequently, his
knowledge of thieves is no more extensive this
week than it was last.

At Sydney Royal the burning pantomime

of comic opera will commence, beginning with the
evergreen “Mik-rta” Miss Leonora” Braham
makes her flis. appearance as Yam Vaa ; Miss
Maggie Moore will do Katisha, though after a
long experience of Alice Barnett we fear she will
hardly look big enough for the part, and the other

Misses Co’.borne Baber and Aggie Kelton, These
two ladles are always well received, and as (here
doesn’t seem to be any real enable chance at pre-
sent of swopping the pair of them for Nellie
Stewart, Sydney will make them welcome in their
new parts. At Her Majesty’s ‘ln the Banks ”is

probably do better era long, as Willie Warner,

The national event of Saturday night was
Nellie Stewart’s reappearance at Melbourne
Princess’s, where the etheral Ellen — why prevari-
cate ? -filled an almighty push with a vague sense
of emptiness in an unknown void. Weighed in a
scale of exaggerated expectation the revived
“Dorothy” seemed more wanting than it might
have been. If the Triumvirate hadn t courted
odious comparisons by improving backwards on
the original cast, and as all interest centred in
the star she was debited with shortcomings not
her own, by the almost unanimous verdict of
iudlscrlminating dudes. Under the best of con-
ditions Miss Nellie Stewart could never knock ’em
to pulp in the part selected for her second
ooming. Her fascinating artificiality befits the
dock-rural maidens of Gilbert the cynic, but
lends itself not to the rustic breezy comedy of
“ Dorothy.” A trip to Europe has left Nellie’s
style just where It was before, while adding
volume and compass to the witchery of her sweet
Voice, Over anxiety to show her new powers to
the best advantage gave the sweet voice a hard
metallic ring on Saturday night, in which respect
Several of the company nobly followed suit. Bat
unless she proves to have cultivated sound at the
expense of melody, Miss Stewart is likely to be-
come a better favourite than ever—in future
operas. In appearance, she is like a goddess re-
freshed with nectar and foreign travel, and the
sweetest of dimples still nestles coyly in her right
cheek. As above hinted, the new portion of the
cast is badly suited to the work. Voice has been
considered before acting ability although
“ Dorothy ” is a comedy rather than an opera—
and one accredited singer, Mr. Federioi, is war-
bling like a raven these last few weeks. Miss
Barnett and little Elton renew their triumphs in
the low comedy department, the latter getting a
reception that is very seldom heard in an
Australian theatre.

A towzled-headed audience filled Mel-
bourne Opera House to see Professor Kennedy, a
mesmerist of Amurrlkan extraction, test the
credulity of a young and rising country. The
Professor collected an impecunious-looking crowd
of subjects on the stage, and chucked a magic
spell at them, after which they played the fool
until everybody felt sick with laughing. Not one
gleam of genuineness lighted up the hollow farce
from first to last; the leading subjects looked as if
they were “ readied” for the occasion, and an in-
vestigating council of three was under the presi-
dency of Victor, ze great wrestler. If Kennedy can
mesmerise any money into his show far more than
a week, he must be a tarnation smarter Yank
than was apparent at his dehiit. The Royal pan
tomime comes to an un-
honoured end this week.

At the Bondi Aquar-
ium (Sydney) another

announced between the
new champion smiber,
Donovan, and a military
man named Meat. Bis

European circus is run-
ning a great and prosper-
ous career in Belmore
Park, and all colonists
who pan out on circuses
are invited to attend. The
Coogee Aquarium has got
another circus as one of
its attractions. Sara
Bernhardt is in mourning
on account of her pet
tiger, which has pegged
out from its earthly
lair and gone to scare
the angels. The people
of tbe hotel where she
resides, however, do not
mourn but rejoice with
an exceeding great joy. In
the old limes, when the
boy knocked at the door
in the morning with
Sarah’s shaving water it
was a toss up whether
the tiger didn’t come out
and eat him. The S.M,
Herald says that Charles
Warner’s “ coupeau,”
wl h a small “ c,” in
“Drink,” was a terribly realistic performance.
Evidently the lunch editor and the foreigner who
keeps his eye on the Hottentot and other out’an-
dish quotations were both out when that was
printed. Alfred Cellier says he went about with
“ Dorothy” under his arm for quite a long time
befora he got a show for it. The music is
“Nell Gwjnne” over again. Amy Sherwin’s
father died the other day. When Mrs. Brown-
Potter’s fi lends met her on board the steamer at
New York, she received them with a litt’e laugh,
and the remark, “ I’m an actress now.” It was
the first they had heard of it, probably. Mrs.
Langtry has set up a p?t alligator in opposition to
Sarah t ernhardt's dead tiger. The animal was
only six inches long a few weeks ago, ha'f of that
being month, but, under the caresses of his mu-
tress, he has grown to a length of 14 inches, of
which six consist of jaw. He crawls all over tbe
drawing-room, and hangs on to visitor!. M'.
Fred Laye, whose connection with the Brough-

When we saw in Sydney D.T. a leader
headed “ The Ability of Being Inconsistent,” we
coughed. That was all.
We always thought that nobody but a

tine imbecility would go out jubilating, but we
find we were mistaken, and we now retire beneath

The Picturesque Atlas of Australasia
has now reached its twenty-first part and shows
no falling off in the artistic or literary ability.
The latest issue deals with the topography of
Queensland, and contains a larga number of
beautifully executed illustrations of northern
scenes. The principal features of Brisbane,
Toowoomba, Maryborough, Rockhampton, and
other towns are reproduced with striking accu-
racy, and the beauties of the coast, such
as they are, are delineated with photographic
accuracy. The literary part of the work supplies
much valuable information about the youngest of
the Australian colonies, and, though the stories
of the old Moreton Bay settlement have bean
toned down in their darkest details, they
will recall to many an old pioneer the half-for-
gotten legends of the time when Britain founded
a branch Sheol on the banks of the Brisbane
River.
The Referee
M‘Shane missed an easy chance from
Moses off the first stroke he made, rather an
expensive miss for the Vies. Moses’ cricket after-
wards was of the most perfect description, and
nothing like it has been seen on the ground since
Murdoch’s historic innings. And, talking of
Moses, reminds us of C. A, Smith’s neatly-timed
little speech after the N.S. Wales-British match,

The great Mick O’Brien suffered much
tribulation at Caulfield after his feeble finish on
Anarchy for the Selling race. The stewards
solemnly warned their young friend that his riding
was so suspicious that he mustn’t do it again,
under penalty of 12 months’ disqualification, and
then stultified themselves by advising him to have
nothing more to do with such ill-tempered beasts
as Anarchy. The facts of the case appeared to
be that the mare played up at the post until the
shadowy Mick (not in the best of health) was too
dead beaten to rouse her up at the finish, and, by
admitting this possibility, the stewards took all
the sting out of their reproof.

Tee biggest crowd yet crammed into
Foley's Hall attended on Monday night to witness
the glove fight, “to a finish,” between Fcgarty
and Charley Dunn, the Newcastle pedestrian and
pugilist. For eighteen rounds the fighting was
ot the mest desperate description, Dunn confining
his heavy visitations to the body, Fogarty
returning with interest on the head. For the last
few rounds Fogarty kept Ms right quiet, so much
so that it was thought he bad injured the hand,
and it was nit until the eighteenth rout d that he
dispelled the illusion by bringing it with smashing
effect on his opponent’s jaw, lifting Dann off h‘s
feet and knocking him senseless. Fogarty has
shown Hmseif to be the hardest rigat-handed
hitter of bis weight—if not of any weight—in the
colonies It may take him a considerable time to
get it on, but when it does reach home he hits
with sufficient force to drop a bu’lock.
* * *
A knock-out, such as Fogarty delivered
on Monday night, leads up to the query : Is the
blow from a comparatively sn ail glove of more
stunning effect than a hit from the naked fist ?
In the “good ild days” men fought forborne,
and, to come to later times, tbe powerful, trained,
heavy a’hletes, Smith and Ktlrain, fought until
darkness drew upon them, without a knock-out
blow. It may be argued that the rounds in a
glove contest, being of three minutes' duration,
weaken the men more than in a ring contest
where the rounds, as a rule, are so much shorter,
but on Monday night, when Fogarty relegated
Mr. Dunn to his little cot, the coaly man, who is
of a remarkably powerful physique, was compara-
tively fresh, and looked fit to light for a week.

Pepper

emu is an uncertain bird which sits
down awful hard on the bread-basket of the
human rabe when its dahder is elevated and its
wild Australian monkey is up, and a man who
now resides in bed at Silverton (N.S.W,) is pre-
pared to swear to this fact before a duly qualified
Commissioner for taking affidavits in the colony.
He was out on the plains with another man, who
is also prepared to swear to it, ard they caught
sight of a tall hen bird meditating along with a
lanky young one kicking up a dost in the rear.
Some demon of incarnate foollshncES fixed upon
the man who is now in bed, and after a long
Stetn chase, he arrested the young bird by the
tail. He probably thought at the moment that he
had done a smart thing, but h=i suddenly became
aware that the baleful eye of the elderly fowl was
fixed Upon him, and after one glance into that
glowing orb he took his prize by the legs and
lighted out for sweet freedom beyond. The next
thing he was aware of was a demoniac welt on
the skull, and it seemed as if a steam hammer
was following him in close pursuit. He let go
the chicken, which fled screaming, and then
the old bird kicked him up in the air
and as he came down it kicked him up
again. A wild rough-and-tumble followed.
Sometimes the man was on top, but generally he
wasn’t, and when he wasn’t on top the emu was.
They dodged round and round each other and
screamed. When the man thought he was close
enough to let out with his left the emu kicked up
a dust and blinded him, and then, before he knew
where he was or where he hoped to be if he could
only get away, the bird got one of its legs round
his neck and was laying on to him with its tail.
Once or twice the man got in a blow on the jaw
which made his opponent wink, but the instant he
stepped back to avoid the return he fell over the
chicken, which came and sat down behind him
every time, and then a wild-looking thing like a
feather-duster gone mad would rush on him in a
whirl of legs and wings and take a mouthful cf
his hair. By the end of the 1 bird round the man
hadn’t any clothes on, and, in the course of two
rounds more, the bird went away with his hoots.
Finally, it left him sitting on a thorny si rub, and
stalked away,, and he was too sick to follow. He
got home at a slow pace, and he testifies that the
emu is not a desirable addition to a quiet family
It has too little regard for the human feelings,
and is given to unjustifiable violence over matters
which should properly be settled by arbitration.
Also, the rapidity with which it does things is
painful, and even aggravating.

The other day at Lubbo a brilliant mili-
tary spectacle was broken all to shivers by one
small bad boy, thereby exposing New South
Wales to the scorn of foreign Powers, especially
bo that of Russia, whose army is now mobilised
ip Poland and liable to break loose at any moment.
Major-General Richardson and Major Morris
were inspecting the local troops on the battle-field
of the dried-up Bogan when the unwashed boy in
question crawled up behind them and felt the tails
of,their coats to see if they were real. Then the boy
noticed that the Major, in all his movemerts, was
careful to keep two paces behind the General, and
he planted himself within corresponding range of
the Major and followed him round. The artillery
began to titter, and the infantry guffawed. The
local captain swelled with indignation, and even
the General grew agitated, while the Major was
almost paralysed by the knowledge that a small
clown from the back-blocks was feeling his coat-
tail every now and then and snortirg with con-
tempt every time he did so. There was nothlcg
in the Articles of War or in any current manuel
on tactics or evolutions to authorise anybody to
cuff the head of this troublesome youth, and it
was useless to bring moral influence to bear up on
him as he obviously had cheek enough to come up
and haul on the coat-tail of a commander-in-chief
in the very midst of a blood-thirsty campaign.
The Inspection was cut short all along of that boy,
and the Major-General passed the corps as efficient,
though his mind was so much shaken up that he
really didn’t know whether it was efficient or not.
His own opinion is that the boy in question would
have wrecked the strategy of Moltke himself,
and if he had got up behind that great soldier at
Sedan he would have made his reason totter on
its throne to such an extent that Prance might
have been saved.

“Let it always be remembered,” said
Parkes, “when we turn to the early history of
f-.hia one colony, that, as long as the offenders of
England were sent here, the offences far which
they were dispatched were such as meet with no
punishment at all to-day.”—
One evening last week an hysterical man
with a bloodshot eye, foam on his Ups, his hair
streaming in the wind, and his hat in the gutter
three streets back, careered madly into the city of
Melbourne watch house. Arrived there, he butted
a woman who had lost a boy with a red head and
a wart on his nose, over a chair, concussed a fat
constable, and then galloped on his prostrate
form, howling the while for police protection, and
peremptorily demanding that the militia and the
field artillery be immediately called out and the
deck cleared for action. Then he raged round,
damaging the brie-a-brac and banging his brow
against the fixtures, and when five minions of the
law got him down and sat on his head and chest,
he gasped bis belief that the Federal Navy
and the Queenscliff fortifications were wanted
for active service, and that the country was going
down to Sheol with promptness and despatch.
A composing draught and a porous plaster were
administered by a constable who used to train
dogs, and, bye and bye, the fever abated Suffi-
cient] y to allow of the visitor explaining that he
had been robtcd of £5OOO worth of jewels by a
sand? complexioned cabman, whose religious con-
victions and moral rectitude were not fit to throw
at a South Sea savage, and whose number was
381)2. Accompanied by an intelligent constable,
the wild-eyed man went out into the night to
hunt for a clue. They sought the suburban villa
of No. 3892, and were told by a very small boy
with a scalded car and an uuscavengered pinny
that dad had not returned ; “ he suppbsed he was
a-havin' a booze.” Then they went through the
city from stem to stern, and groped about in
highways and byewaya for tbepedatory hackman,
but found him not. It is necessary to explain
here that the wild-eyed man had hired
the cabman to drive him to the Flinders-
street station, and had gene on to the
platform, leaving his sample cases cf jewellery In
tbs cab, and, returnirg a few minutes later, he
had feund the cab gene. This caused him to fly
off the handle and behave in the promiscuous
manner we have described. Weary and worn the
bagman and the officer “ aV th’ law ” were at last
about to abandon the hunt when a bright idea
struck the latter—the unexpectedness of the thing
nearly blfew his he*fd off—and he suggested that
they might try the station. They tried the
station, and found the cabman and the cab, the
former whiling away the Mine by totting up his
bill on the flags with a lump of candle-grease.
He had not moved, but the commercial had come

out from the station at a different gate from the
one at which he entered, aud then he had
promptly uttered a powerful whoop because his
cab wasn’t there, which it couldn’t very well be
as it was somewhere else, and had broke for the
police station. He recognised the cabman at the
very first go, and the cabman recognised him, and
they knew each other, and then as the situation
dawned on him he leant his fevered brow against
a lamp-post and besought the constable to cut him
open to see if be was an idiot. The constable did
not cut him open, however, thus affirming his
'judgment in language that was more eloquent
than words,

She lives close to the city of Wellingt on (N.Z.) and,
being a lineal descendant of the old burnt offering,

Martyrs. Feeling the want of a little recreation
after a long spell at that cheerful yarn about the
smashed Christians of the past she last week
struck a boiled saveloy attitude, and said she
would give a feed and a dance. Invitations were
sent out, and all the horny-handed for miles
around rolled up. The evening passed merrily,
and the visitors splodged about in the airy mazurka
until supper-time, and then an awful discovery
came down upon that festive throng, and made
them ask why they had been born. Somebody
had lifted the hash and fled with it through the
back door. The beer also had been hooked, and
a dark-browed assassin had rushed into the fog
of obscurity with the sausages. The ponderous
duff was absent, and when they asked where it
had gone to, echo answered “ Where * ” The
blano-mange was lying outside the door, and the
tart, which an hour before had been sitting on the
table, had vanished amid the boundless wastes
of the infinite, the unreachable, and the
unhere. The rum had torn Itself a Way, and even
the loaf had gone where the woodbine twlneth,
and there was nothing left but spuds and sour
milk. It is owing to these things that Mrs.
Cranmer now weeps in her desolate household,
and wishes She were away with the burnt ancestor
and tearing round among the stars. Meanwhile her
guests have formed themselves into a vigilance

they propose to hang hiih on high on a telegraph
pole, and then throw mud at his head.

In tile remote regions of Charters Towers
there dwells a sharebroker who combines with
the pastime of broking the business df spiritualism,
without injuring his constitution. The other
night he fixed up a stance with a darkened room
and a good supply of spirits- They were all
gathered rotlnd a table which was covered with a
large horse-cloth, ’the belleVers were rather a
miscellaneous lot and included a few picturesque
ruins who had once been females, one or two
bank clerks, an egg merchant, a stranger who
looked like a retired pirate, a woman of the
Bloomer persuasion, and a coal heaver or two.
Messages from the land of stlff-’uns were
rapped with celerity, and cemetery corres-
pondence floated In the atmosphere. In fact,
things \Verfe going as smoothly as Judas
Iscariot sliding dotVn hill, till at last the con-
ductor of the show called attention to a
materialised spirit which was about to appear.
Then suddenly a wild soprano scream rang out,
and one of the ruins told the spirit he was no
gentleman, the spirit, who seemed to have got
fixed under the table, told her to shut up, and she
kicked out wildly and asked him what he was
going to do with her corns. Then the spirit
gave a rqighty heave at the table and asked who
was a-puttin’ of her dashed big foot in his eye
apyhow. “ Leggo, you wretch,” screeched the
lady. “ I wish to the Lord I could let go,” said
the visitor from thq other world huskily
“ Whp’s.been tyln’ of me up in knots ? Dash you,
you’ve got your feet in my pocket; ; take them
out, you old vampire ! f and then the spirit tore
hiipself out from under the table, upsetting it on
top of the circle, and breaking the cord that
upheld the concertina which, was supposed to be
floating in the air, and letting it down on the
head of the broker, where it concussed a good
deal,! There w v as a rush, and, two heels twinkling
In the air. Something heavyfell out of the win-
dow, and thpy heard it tear through the fence,
and do a spurt down the road. Then the. light
was turned on. and the sharebroker, holding his

regretted to say, did happen now and* then

HARE SOUP.
Why, certainly 1 We’re quite aware
That convicts mostly shot a hare
(Which must have been a common crime
With people in the olden time),
Just here and there you’d find a case
Of someone who had bagged a brace
Of partridges on grounds preserved ;
But ne'er a martyr yet deserved
The sentence he was working oxlt—
Of that there isn’t any doubt.
The crimes which led to long exilo
Would now provoke a passing smile.
The dreadful things they used to rue
We’d now encourage them to do. 1

OI Statue of the Queen (heroic size),
Most rilonstroUs of a doZan sculptured lies,
Upon that pedestal condemned to stay
And swallow Insults all the blessed day,
How hard your lot! A mark for honest soOrn.
“Alas !’’ cry you, “ that ever I was borrl."
A sickly crew ot servile snobs applaud,
And vainly strive to sanctify the fraud
With choice expressions of & feigned belief
In their good Queen’s pre-eminence in grief.
Your drowsy eyelids and your mouth drawU
down
Each royal curie, from royal toe to crown —
Evoke a word of sympathy that's sham.
Meanwhile the people merely mutter “ D -n !”
And you, poor Statue, conscious of your shame.
Would all connection with the Queen disdain ;
Were you but with a power of speech endowed
You’d claim a hearing from the grinning crowd,
And thus discourse : “In me, dear friends, be-
hold
The falsa presentment of a lady old ;
This forni erect, which glistens ’neath the sun.
Should not exceed a height ot five foot one ;
This cheek, bafarrowed with pathetic lines,
Is puffed and purple when your Monarch dines ;
This nose colossal, though in outline true,
Coiiveya no notion of its normal hue—
Enough, good paopla. In this Statue find
A Queen existing in a Tory’s mind.
Bear with me gently fdr a little while—
Scoff mercifully, pleasantly revile—
The reign of grovel draweth near its end.
And then your Statue will ba hailed as friend.
When Austral's sons for Austral’s sake unite
To oust the wrong and usher in the right;
When Governors return from whence they came,
And you are free in fact, as well as name ;
When you have burned the baneful British flag,
Here erstwhile planted to appal the lag—
Then will your old identities so dense
Behold their fetish melted down to pence."

RHEUMATIC BAROMETERS.
Weather changes indicate themselves by pains
called rheumatism. Why bad weather should
cause such pains is a mystery ! Does the pain
really lie dormant in the blood, to be made active
only when the wind blows from some unfavour-
able quarter 2 At first many thought it to be a
trouble of the j oints, but all outward applications
eft the cause unbenefited, Then, causing like
pains in the muscles, it was thought to be a
muscular disease; but the same unsatisfactory re-
sults followed external treatment. Now, however,
it is universally acknowledged that rheumatism is
‘ ‘ a fiery condition of the blood caused by an acid
state of the system ! ” What causes this “acid
condition?” Last week a prominent man left
town on a business trip. Two days later he, who
had always been apparently strong and wall, was
sent home a corpse—“ Rheumatism of the heart! ”
Everybody dreads rheumatism. It Is very preva-
lent at this changing time of the year. Id was
formerly seldom known except among those who
worked much out of doors. Now id invades the
hut, the palace, and the throne room; all sorts
and conditions and races of men and women it at-
tacks at all times, and all fear it! Frederick
Baseden, of Swansea House, New Karm, Brisbane,
suffered for many years from rheumatism. Last
January he went to the Brisbane Hospital, leav-
ing it in April in about tbesame condition as when
he entered it. At that time he had a complete
stoppage of the water, and was confined to his
bed.< for five weeks. A friend recommended
Warner’s safe cure and Warner’s safe pills, which
he took with wonderful benefit, and eventually his
pain ceased, and with it his urinary trouble Mrs.
Eva Gee, of Gympie, Q, suffered excruciating
pain from rheumatism in ker ankles, joints,
wrists, and fingers for 16 months. Warner’s safe
cure, alternated with Warner’s safe rheumatic
cure, brought her relief when everything else
failed. John Atkinson, of Ipswich, Q , the oldest
freemason in the colonies, now aged 92 years, and
who had been troubled with rheumatism for 12
years, was cured with six bottles of Warner’s safe
rheumatic cure. Alfred Wm. Cotnpigne, of Bean-
leigh, Q., police magistrate; William Wyatt,
miner, of North Creswick, aged 60 years ; Edwin
Macaree, alderman, of Rockhampton, Q , and
many others, have been cured of rheumatism
with Warner’s safe rheumatic cure. What this
great medicine has done for others it will do for
you.*

The “Vagabond” says: “la Boehm’s

slightly sulky.” The Argus man says the statue
“represents the Quean in mature age, matronly
in figure, austere to severity in expression, a look
of pn l er on the face, but mingled with pathos
and pain.” That's always the way. If with a
good stock of reverence you approach the con-
templation of a stout old lady with a bad-
tempered f;ca you talk of “mature aga, 1 ’
“ matronliness ” and “austereness even unto
severity.” If, on the other hind, you ba an
irreverent democrat like Mr. Julian Thomas, yon
perceive none of the comparatively dignified at-
tribute of “austerity.” The “austere linea-
ments," as seen by the monarch-worshipping
Tory, are but “ a sulky mug ” in the eyes of the
man from the Age office. As Mr . Dailey said, on
a memorable occasion years ago: “Place the

crowns on their heads, and conceal the rope-
marks on their necks by means cf Elizabethan
frills and such contrivances. Having done this,
they should proceed to put the kings and queans
into the Chamber of Horrors. It’s hard to tell
the exact truth about His Majesty’s face or His

At the Centennial Press dinner Sir Henry
Parkes, in proposing the toast of the “ Press,'
said that when he founded—or foundered—the
Empire newspaper, the only journals outside
Sydney were the Maitland Mercury, the Border
Post, and tho Bathurst Free Press, Just here
ho might have been grateful enough for once to
pay a tribute to the venerable proprietor of the
last named journal, who, in St Henry s first
financial difficulties, raised for him a sum of
£lOOO in the City of the Plains on condition that
he retired from the political arena for ever. Sir
Henry took the coin on these conditions, but the
slippery old man didn’t retire worth a cent.
Sir Henry Parkes does not think that
people have any right to call themselves rotec-
tiODists," as such persons are really rssur-
rectionists.” This utterance commands respect.
The man who resurrected the Klama Ghost and
John Davies, and the red-hot brand of shame, and
who wanted to build the Dead Douse, and who
rose again after getting £lOOO at Bathurst on con-
dition of quitting political life or ever, and who
retired from Parliament for ever half-a-d'zen
times and resurrected himself on each occasion,
should be an authority on body-snatching and
similar subjects. Protection has risen again, and
if, asParkes seems to hint, it had no r ght to do
so, then there is equally good reason why he
should himself lie hard down at the last day and
take no notice of the trumpet.
Redmond Greely, farmer, of County Gal-
way, Ireland, has for five years been treading on
the tail of the British Lion, and it is still a ques-
tion whether he or the Empire on which the sun
never sets in its sane moments will come out
uppermost. In 1883 his landlord turned him out
of his farm, and when he went back he was lifted
off, and imprisoned for trespass. Since then he
has been going back every time he came out of
gaol, and has been regularly hauled off to prison
for doing it, but when his sentence expires he
simply goes back some more. In fact, he has
gone back more than any other man in the
British dominions, and, as no one will take the
farm in his absence, he came out of gaol for about
the fifteenth time the other day, and settled down
on the old spot. The landlord had taken the
house away in his absence, but 200 men turned
out and built another one, and all Galway is
howling to see the man who will venture to lay a
hand on the domicile.
There is in New Zealand one electorate—
only one—-which can be said to have sunk lower
than even Mudgee in its choice of a representa-
tive. It commenced its career in the early days
with a Wesleyan local preacher for its member,
and in him it placed its confidence for many
years. He was regularly loaded down with filthy
lucre, but his reputation was untarnished until he
began to follow after strange women and strange
liquors, and to stay out late at night and not come
home till morning. Ultimately, certain painted
matrons had him for £17,000 among them, and
thus the female of his race brought him low. He
became stone-broke and got 48 hours owing to
being left alone with a two-shilling piece and the
coin not being there when the other fellow came
back. The next representative started life in a
dead-broke condition, and when he drank himself
to death hla worldly possessions didn’t amount to
a barrow-load of bricks. Following him came a
card-sharper. He had not been kicked out of a
fashionable club, as was generally reported, but
he had been kicked inside and then went out
voluntarily and in great haste. He was also
posted as a turf-defaulter, and no well-regulated
household in all N Z. was complete without his
1.0. U. But he still lives and gets a vote of con-
fidence from his constituents every time he
addresses them, and on the whole he is doing
about as well as can reasonably be expected.

A little while ago,
in one of the colonies, a
party of English tourists,
among whom were a
“nobleman” or two,
were invited by a station-
holder, whose homestead
they were passing, to
partake of refreshments.
They accepted and were
most hospitably treated.
Several of the party dis-
played much enthusiasm
concerning a monster
kangaroo-skin which
their entertainer had
nailed up in his sitting-
room, and two of them,
cads in loud checks,
eventually had the bad
taste to make him cash-
offers for the trophy.
“Look here,” said Mr.
Jumbuck, “I am not a
nobleman, but I have
treated you all as gentle-
men. You in return have
grossly insultedme in my
own house. Please leave
my premises - there Is
the doer !’’ We have
always thought the cash
offer to your host was
never made save in that
land of perfect freedom,
the United States. One
cold evening in San
Francisco a few years
ago the present writer
was wearing a big frieze
coat. A roan whom he
had never seen before came up and remarked in a
loud voice : “ I say, stranger, do you want to sell
that coat? Because, if you do, I'll give you 60
dollars for it."

ever came to such a dom'd hole as Sydney,

manby, Lech, Robinson and every other Governor
that Bdtaln ever blessed us with. He hadn’t

Theawhyhad Carlng:on, a presumedly wealthy

by accident, we’va got the answer fro u a wander-
ing dook who knew our family before it became

Governor Oarington has ever a keen ey e
to his personal popularity. His method of dealing
with the crowd at large differs very considerably
from that of Parkes, Hay and Co., and other
bo-baubled politicians, whose experience is purely
colonial. At the laying of the foundation stone
cf the new Sydney Houses of Parliament the
decorated orators named, addressed their elo-
quence exclusively to the gilded bourgeoise on
the “grandstand,” but when Governor Car-
ington’s turn arrived he showed his back to the
grand-stand (enthusiastic applau-e from that
quarter was, he knew, certain) and spot e to “the
mob," who were not slow to notice the fact.

When it was announced in Sandhurst that
Qeorga Lansell, the loeal quartz millionaire (his
neb income from Sandhurst reefs alone is quite
£250,000 per annum), was returning to Victoria,
the good people of Bendigo determined to bid him
welcome in real West End fashion. (George has
of late been living In a £60,000 London house
bo'onging to Jennings, the china-basin man, who
recently fell from a horse and cracked his skull.)
So they got up a requisition signed with 1000
names asking Mr. Lansell to dine with them at
Burridge'e well-known Verandah Hotel. The full-
fed reefer, who, having lunched at tho Continental
and Metropole, liketh nob Bendigo “ grub,” said
“ No.” Let them, Instead of feeding him, make a
subsoripbion for the Sandhurst hospital, and,
however large the total might be, he would add
to It £ for £ on the Government-grant principle.
So the hat went round, and the result was 25
shillings, 26 sixpences, 36 threepenny pieces— £2
7s. In all. Then millionaire Lansell, who dearly
loves a joke and has learned from MTntyre, M P.,
and others what banquet popularity means, added
to the subscription his little £2 7s.—and the hos-
pital was enabled to purchase two new straw
palliasses for the erysipelas tent. No, Mr. Bur
debt Smith. We must really decline your kind
offer of a complimentary dinner. Please convey
our thanks and apologies to Mr. Dan O’Connor.

Lady Oaringbon’s Centennial reception
was a heated crush of the flower of Asstralla
interspersed with members of Parliament. The
Russian Grand Dook —not looking a bit like the
grand dukes we are so familiar with in Offenbach
or Leoocq—was there, and the dark perfection of
his complexion was a good foil for the golden-
warm fairness of Allen, M.L.A.—nob the poet
One gentleman and lady from Mud Flat had
brought the baby along—a rather dissipated-
looking hostage in soiled woollen “booties "and
a hilarious pinafore spotted with plum jam. The
Arcadian male motive carried this Infant gallantly
and walked a little ahead of his lady, who lagged
(we use this word quite innocently) behind with
her mouth open and two or thr v e feet of braid
trailing off her frock. As this original couple
approached vice-regality, the herd of butchers
and bakers elevated their snubby noses and
audibly expressed their scorn and surprise at the
“ cheek o' them cookies." Lady Lily, however,
smiled as sweetly upon the seleotor as upon the
over-dressed daughter of any mls-flt city tailor, and
he unconscious trio drifted out on to the lawn
where light refreshments ware dispensed to this
topsy-turvy assemblage.

Iq the convulsive struggles of the people
of Parramatta bo fl ad out which tree it was that
Lady Mary Fi'zroy was concussed against when
Sir Charles took her for that fatal drive, they have
unearthed a fa w pretty stories about tho lady who
raled at Government Ho isa in the back part of the
'5O s. Lady Fitzroy was mta sassiety butterfly ; in
fact sbe was the sort of lady who would have bean
called a woman by the ladies of the present time,
and, nowadays, a “woman ” is the pla'nest thing
on earth,froma “lady’s” point of view,barring only
a “female.” Shortly after her arrival at Govern-
ment House an Ironmonger called round to leave
his card, and In doing so ho made acquaintance
with a nioo looking—well, that was just where
the difficulty came In ; anyhow he took her to be
only a female—in a print go wn, and he presently
grew familiar and gave her a £5-note with a promise
of more if she used her influence with the old girl
to get him the gubernatorial custom. It isn’t even
certain that he didn’t chuck her under the chin.
Anyhow, he got a letter next day to the effect
that Lady Mary Fitzroy thanked him for the £5
note, which she had bestowed on a certain
charity, and she didn’t want to see him any more,
and then the ironmonger learned that he was the
only man in N. S W. who had ever tipped the wife
of an Excellency, and he kicked himself sixteen
times and ate half a stove in sheer desperation.

Lady Oarington and the Countess of Car-
narvon wore whits costumes touched up with

journeyed out to Parkea’ Park to plant two droop-

pi til ass noonday sun, and succeeded to a marvel,
as also did the sun. Baron Ca iogton, who rode

ribbon, which have been in the way when
he was gardening The otlmr Governors looked
as if they would be sorry when their colonies had
to centenniate too, and all, even seasoned Sir
Anthony Mu'grave, were suffering to such an ex
tent that the audierca could hear the perspiration
dropping off them.

The numerous Y.R.’s which glowed in
various parts of Sydney on illumination night
were truly instructive, conveying, as they did, a
great moral lesson in economy. These numerous
i atires were in great force on Jubilee night, and
the lavish Sydneyites hauled them out and stuck
them up—regardless of the misfit—to do duty for
“ the great national celebration,” The illumina-
tion which, for beauty, won, hands down, was
the moon ; “ pale Cynthia,” in a clear and silent
sky, sailed calmly overhead, and outdid in silvery
glory even the sheen of the tresses of the “ Hairy
Bismarck,”

He was a curly-headed youth from

by Beck and which was perpetrated by Hume is

“ Tho’ Australia’s birth be lowly, is Australia
then to blame ?
May she not look upward, onward, strive for for-
tune, power, and fame ?
If she gains by her endeavour glory in all nations'
eyes,
Shall her sons ha deemed ignoble, having had the
strength to rise ?
Is it manly, fair, or honest with our early sins to
stain
What we aimed at, worked for, conquered—aye,
an honest, noble name ?
And those gutter pleasure is to stir
the hideous past,

which their minds are cast.
Look ahead and not behind ns, look to'what is
sunny, bright—
Look into our glorious future, not into our
shadowed night.”
It wouldn’t be kind to leave Fergus and the Im-
mortal Beck to the little moulds In which their
l .ttle minds are cast. They are men and brothers,
in spite of colour, and The Bulletin will supply
them with larger moulds, in the hope that their
minds will gradually fill ’em out: —
If Australia’s birth was lowly, lay on England all
the blame,
Who did her level best to found a colony of
shame;
All our sons had’been ignoble, we had never risen
yet,
It England could have helped it, you your bottom

dodge about in vim—
We have not the crime committed, though Aus-
tralia bears the stain ;
And the “ gutter ” scribes, who manfully rake up
the buried past,
Show at whom our foul foundation-stone should
rightfully be cast.
Look cautiously behind them, then look steadily
ahead,
And point in the direction where Australians must
be led—
Glean their wisdom of the morning from the les-
son of the night,
And testify their wisdom in the articles they
write.

I MONSTER ALLIGATOR CAPTURED IN
QUEENSLAND I
A Centennial alig it or. ICO years old, and
leasurlng 27ft. 3£l >. long, was captured by a
ineensland miner, wlo was returning to camp 20
illes from Cairns. This monstrous reptile has
eea consigned >o Geo. Bannett, of Sydney, to be
xhibited in public at the Bondi Aquarium during
be Centennial week. The miner writes that he
3 a lazy brute, but says if he Is let lotse he will
aed himself at, public expense. The miners de-
cription of the brute’s habits is amusing and ex-
leecHngiy entertaining. Instead of the alligator
muting for bis food—whlch is a popular and ex-
floded fallacy —is in fact a base alligation, and
he alligator knows it; he lets his vlotua’s hunt
rim. He gently reclines cn a sand bank, with
nouth open, apparently dead. Soon a small boy

is now seen approaching, and unconsciously
strolled within a few feet of his saurian majesty
before discovering his peril. He, h< wever, had
travelled, and nothing daunted at bis appalling
position, seems to hesitate but a moment when
drawing from the recesses of his overcoat pocket
a small parcel containing two bottles of that
famous St. Louis Lager Beer. He fires It with
force and precision in*o the alligator’s jaws An
earthquake succeeds. The wiithings and contor-
tions of the monster to obtain tte flavour of this
delicious beverage results in dislocation. He
gulps down the entire menagerie and opens his
front door for more. These are a few of the
habits of this Centennial Queensland insect.*

tearfully of her sufferings, though the natives
aver that Miss Baker is seen looking out of a

the hearing of the dispute before Sir Charles

Sir Charles would say, “ You have delayed us by
your non-appearanoe, Mr. Baker " And Mr.
Baker wou d raply, “ My daughter is much worse

A slight disturbance mingled with 1m-
I proper games took place on the Centennial night,
in the course of which a ballet corps was, as we
might say, disorganised. There was a spavined
pantomime on in the vicinity of longitude 11 7,
Australia, and a pale young man used
to hang about the stage door, atd take two or
three or more of the ladies home. Oa the
occasion in question, however, he resolved to
explode In a great burst of generosity, so he In-
vited about six of the fairies to supper at a
suburban pub., where the beer is a gangrened
beverage, and the landlord is hypothecated, and
his wife has a mottled appearance, and her bustle
doesn’t sit straight. When the pantomime had
struggled through, and the ballet had clothed
itself in the manner which is required in the public
streets, though the same isn’t always necessary
on the public stage, the gentleman, who had been
adjacent in the lane, put the company into a
couple of cabs, and the innumerable caravan of
the saints travelled on till they drew up at the
most down ln-the-mouth looking pub. they bad
ever seen. There was the usual row over the
fare, but they left the young man ani one girl to
fight it out with the cabmen anl a loafer who
waa backing them up, and shortly after peace was
restored and the proceedings commenced, in the
inner tabernacle of the grog depot a cable was
spread wilh a dozen bottles of alleged champagne,
some jam tarts, an alamaniine fowl, and a cork-
screw. The landlord was invited to partake, but
tue landlaoy, whose bustle was more out of the
straight than usual, was not. The show was of a
loud and jovial character, and after a by mn had
been sung upside down even the landlord grew
exoited and put his arm round the nearest lady s
waist. Then his wife unhitched her eye from the
keyhole and entered. She thumped herself on
the chest with a tray which she was carrying
and asked with unnatural calmness what it
meant. The girls told her to go out and lose her-
self and she reflected on their hair. Then one of
them chased her upstairs, and the landlord threw
an empty bottle after the girl who was endeavour-
ing to assault his lawful missus. The after pro-
ceedlnga were too painful to relate. Suffice it to
aa y that when anybody saw a head sae or he hit
it right off, and in the grey dawn of the morning
a sad and bashed-ahout gang straggled home-
wards from that suburban pub. Next night the
ballet went mostly upon crutches, and an owner

At this festive season, when the national
heart almost bursts with generosity, and goodwill
to all men prevails, there is one graceful act of
charity which should not be left undone. Some-
one interested in maintaining the Imperial regime
in Australia might work up a decent speech for
poor Lord Caringcon, and, having put on it a penny
stamp and addressed it to Government House,
Sydney, drop it into the first pillar-box. There
will he no necessity to put into it any “er’s” or
“haws’' —these things will be supplied by the
noble crater when he comes to work it off in pub-
lic as a little thing of his own.

Hera is an interesting little circumstance
from Auckland (N Z). Bishop Cowie was leaving
that place, and was presented with the usual two
yards of oily gammon and the very unusual
purse of sovereigns. The oily gammon was read
to him by the customary prominent citizen, and
the dust was plankei down on the table in front
of the good man who was leaving. And what do
you think he did? The customary thing, of
course, is to deposit the coin lovingly next the
recipient’s heart and squash the address into his
tail pocket, but Bishop Cowie reversed the order
of things and carried reverently away the written
outpouring of his flock and left the 400 sovereigns
lying on the table. The stupefied treasurer eat
for hours with his eye fixed in a stony glare on
the abandoned cash; then his senses returned
and he fled to the telegraph-office and wired in-
structions through to Russell that somebody
should stop the steamer, for God’s sake, and in-
form the Bishop that he had slithered without his
filthy lucre. The distracted committee tore their
hair and asked if this was a'l a dream—a phan-
tasy of the night—and every moment they ex-
pected to see a red-hot prelate shoot round the
corner on his return for the cash. But the
minutes wore on, and at last a telegram came
back. The message had arrived too late; the
steamer had touched at Russell and gone on its
way, and the Bishop had vanished into the remote
regions of the infinite, leaving his coin lying on
the table. Excuse these teats. The committee
gathered up the dust and locked it away, and then
went home to repent of their sins and wait in a
dazsd condition for the cataclysm which is to
swallow up all things mortal when Gabriel’s fog-
horn booms out its note upon the startled earth.

Percy Albert Greg went out the other
day, at Newcastle, to fix up an Evening News
sensation of monstrous dimensions. He laid him-
self down beside the main road with two empty
ohlorodyne bottles, and then he scratched his
miserable throat with a big, bloodthirsty-looking
knife, and smeared the gore all over himself
Having thus fixed np the pantomime to the bast
of hia ability, he started to roll about in agony,
and tear up the kerbstone with his teeth, and
make statements to the effect that “ she would he
free shortly.” A stolid passer by found Percy
Albert Greg proceeding in this style, and took
him for a circus advertisement or a puff for a
new hair-rest war, but, after watching him for
some time, he concluded that something should
be done to him, and, taking him up on a shovel,
he pub him in an omnibus and directed it to the
hospital. They tipped Percy out at the gate, and
the doctors shook him up and told him not to
make an ass of himself, and, finally, he was
landed in the donjon-keep of the local lock up.
Even the magistrate, howevar, wouldn’t have
anything to do with him, and, amid the coarse
derision of the Court, he sneaked sorrow ully
away with his empty bottles and his razor and
the rest of hia arsenal, and went home to his wife.
It was the meanest little suicide within the
memory of man.

“ Lady Carlngton’s reception yesterday was an
unqualified success." —Evening News.
This little butterfly sentence is gathered from
amongst the flowers of rhetoric and poasy in the
“ Brevity ” column of the Evening News. It looks
innocent enough ; there Is nothing in it to suggest
anguish and grief and boiling tears, ruin, de-
struction, desolation, and bailiffs, but, neverthe-
less, it contains the germs of hideous evil, and the
seeds of insolvency ara hidden in its calm, un-
rnffiei depths Lady Caringtoris reception was
an unqualified success. We reckon that it was.

solaco of her declining years, used to welt the
dishes and carry np the coals in the palace of a
bloated aristocrat in the suburbs, bub a few weeks
ago she shook off the yoke of this swell and married
a young man wi'h a small salary. Her mother
remained, howevar, Jn her hnmb’e home, and
rolled the ceaseleis mangle round in Its orbit as
before. She was pursuing this avocation as usual,
the o'her day, and the half-paid for implement
was whizzing in its wonted cirol*, when the
shadow of a large yellow bonnet was oast upon
the fltor, and the lady outside asked the woman
inside if she would like to collect a few shillings
for the Parkes charity. “ Lor bless me 1 ’ said the
owner of tho manulss wot can I do for
Srenyparks, an’ mo with that pile of shirts
that I don’t know how I’m to get through for
a month ? " The lady cast a lofty glance at the
mangle, and sniffed, “ Oh. well! you can got a
few shillings among your customers perhaps, and,
if you do we 11 put you on the committee,” and,
leaving a small book in which to ent?r the dona-
tions. sho departed. For the next few weeks the
desei tel mangle was silent in Taras Halls, and,
whi'e the Instalments wore accumulating and the
shirts lay neglected In a heap, an Inflated washer-
woman wae skimming round the slums collecting
funds for the ex-Eiama Ghost. In the evenings
she would come homo dcad-boat, and look with a
sinking of the heart on the growing mortgage
which sat on her paralysed time-payment shirt-
grinder, but then the recollection would return
Chat she was now a member of the committee,
and was privileged to sit in solemn conclave with
the toffs of Pott’s Point, and this cheered her
drooping soul. And so time went on, till at last
the apex of her glory was reached and her mag-
nificence culminatei. The lady with the bonnet
came round and took the money she had cotected,
and informed her that the committee ware ail ex-
pected to be present at Lady Carington’s next re-
ception. That night also the time-payment
mangle was silent, and its wheels failed to revive
ovar the tail of tne emotionless washng bill. Ice
accumulated garments which should have been
senthome a month previously were abandonee, ana
the owner of the comatose laundry-organ went out
and mortgaged herself for more than she could p»y
in twelve months in order that she might scintil-
late in elegant attire at the reception. Then she
hunted up her daughter, and she also bought clothes
on such an aiarmirg scale that her husband won t
be able to p--y the bill till next Christmas They
both shone i« the gubernatorial halls and were in-
troduced as being connected with the committee,
and there were high old times in the rent-free
premises of Smith. And now the show is over,
and it begins to dawn on a distracted and raving
washerwoman that she has been undone by the
Parkes tribute, and the mangle revolves franii-
cal y on its focus far into the night in its efforts
to stave off utter ruin, and its shriek can be
heard flying through the silent atmosphere like
the scream of a lost soul in a bankrupt laundry.
The nobility of Potts Point no longer smile at the
widow as they pass by, and the hypothecated tog-
destroyer is sliding down the glassy slope of
Avernus and dragging the distracted owner with
it to financial destruction. Unless Sir ’finery, or
some other charitable individual, subscribes the
amount of the overdue installments this week one
member of the Parkes committee will probably
be left homeless, and will go out a wandere: and
an outcast to seek the cold hospitality of the
gutter, and curse with curses loud and deep the
day when she first heard the name of Parkes.

Two cadging sons of Albion hang out not
very far from Sydney, and they are fast
eating the location bare. One doesn’t expect
much from the Englishman who says he is a
gentleman of independent means, and experience
has shown that there is less to be expected from
two Englishmen than from one. If any mis-
directed Australian happens to nod to this pair,
they both come into tea next evening, and, having
damped themselves down, they survey the table.
“ Now do you know,” says the smaller of the two.
in a soft, insinuating voice, “ I always think that
a little cold meat Koea nicely with tea," and the
fatted lamb is produced. “Aw—l've often
noticed that cold besf and lamb go very well
together. Haven’t you—aw —observed that your-
self ?” This generally brings the cold beef also to
the fore, and the pair sail in at a great rate.
Then one leans back in his chair end says
in a voice of deep introspection, “It’s a good
many years now since I consulted a doctor—you
remember the fellah, don’t you”—his mate re-
members the fellow—“ and he told me always to
eat pickles. Now, do you happen to have a
pickle ? I really don’t like to trouble you ; I don’t
indeed,” Smothered execrations and pickles
Then the ocher Englishman takes up the
parable in the thong ,tful voice of one who is
musing at a great distance ; “ I’ve often—ahem !
—noticed that—aw—jam is an excellent—eh—
thing with tea.” He mentions this as if he were
stating an abstruse fact in science, and his look
of wild surprise whan the jam arrives is some-
thing worth remembering. At the same time, he
reacaes to the uttermost bounds of the table, and
softly extracts the mlik-iug from its place teside
the hostess and pours the whole contents into his
cup. In tha course of the entertainment the pair
graze on everythieg which th y can lay their
hands on, and next day they arrive in time for
dinner, and start afresh. When that meal comes
to an end they fall back in their chairs with a
sigh of contentment, and one remarks, with a
bland, gentle smile. “Haw, now that dinah is
ovah, d i you know I almost—haw —wish you had
asked me to stay to tea,” It is a cold day when
these two sons of Britain are left; in fact, they
were bowled out only one?. Aa unhappy clerk,
at whose lodgings they had dined for six nights
successively, took to dining out himself to get
clear of the incubus, and then they sat for two
mortal hours on his doorstep, In the hope that he
might return and feed them. Finally, they at-
tempted to negotiate a meal off his landlady on
the strength ot the acquaintanceship, and were
left. It was a tight placa that they found them-
salves in, but they made it up by a good dinner
next day at the house of a man whom they called
upon because they thought he resembled some
one their father had known many years ago in
England, and they were much surprised to learn
that he was a different individual altogether.
Still they stayed and dined with him for the sake
of the resemblance, and next evening they came
in at tea-time to ask it ha was qui’e sure he
wasn’t the fellah they meant.
Mr. A. J. Ivimey’a new book on North
Queensland will be out shortly. It treats of every-
thing fro n Separation to “ Northern barmaids,"
and if the author’s anticipation are realised will
be the death blow to Psalmyell of Wale?.
When the Sidney quack meets with a case
which he cannot fully comprehend, he generally
takes down the nearest bottle and has a random
shot at the human inside, after which ha waits
results. One of the so mat ical luminaries recently
found himself more puzzled than usual, but he
disguised bis emotion, and wro e a brief para
graph in hierogb pules, and the patient took it
round to the chemist and clamoured for
his medicine. The latter public ter vane,
however, declined to oblige him on the
ground that ihe compound was a violent explo-
sive, which would blow the vi .als out of him at
the very first go, and spatter him all over the
wall. This adds a new element to the beautiful
uncertainty of medical science. Once the con-
sumptive sufferer used to die softly, with a sweet
smile on his features, bub now the chance is that
he will go off like a volcano and wreck the whole
street, and the anxious mother who si s
up at night will start at every noise,
under lha awful impression that her sick
baby has blown up like a bomb. Life Is
already sufficiently precarious without this
additional danger It was never intended that the
departing Christian should remove the entire
locality with him in bis llight. and arrive at the
Golden Gate in the form of hash never. Mian
dwells for bat a short space in this sublunary
vale, and he was meant to quit it quietly and
without a riot in his inside. It Is time for the
new Medical Bilt to hurry up.

With thanks for forwarding me a bottle of your

Gentlemen, —I have great pleasure in reoom*
mending Row’s D anellon Bitters. I have been
suffering for several years with Liver complaint,
and been under several doctors for it without any
curative result. 1 have only taken two bottles of
your Dandelion Bitters, and feel quite a different
man. I can, therefore, with truthfulness, advise
all who suffer from Liver complaint to toy them,—
Yours,

ths undersigned i—
“ I have for many years been obliged to take
medicines of different kinds for affections of the
liver, indigestion, pain in the chest, general de-
bility, feelings of nervousness, weariness,- great
depression of spirits, and so on, but all without
producing any beneficial effect, till at last, being
recommended to try ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, which, happily, I find has produced an
unexpected and wonderful effect and change in
my system, and has removed from my mind the
horribly depressed feeling and former condition of
bodily ailment I have so unhappily experienced
for so many years.
“lam glad of the opportunity to make known
the excellent qualities of ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, that those who are afflicted as I have
been may take advantage of them.

The Goat.
A LEGEND OF BALMAIN.
Let those the picturesque who chase
Put this do ?en in their notes —
Balmain, it is a pleasant place—
A pleasant place for goats.
Retract from an unpublished ballad by Parties.
Chap. I.
A lady in Balmain has a baby. She doesn’t
Buckle it. They get a goat. The goat is in the
habit of eating papers and posters off hoardings.
Chap. II.
One day the goat eats a 8t. Patrick’s Day Pic-
nic pester. It returns a violent Irish Catholic.
Its milk, of course, infects the baby, who, at that
abnormally early age, opens its little rosebud
mouth to say, “To Hell wi h King William!’
Subsequently the goa t eats a poster of the Orange
Lodge. The baby's ideal change, &c , &c. You
can imagine the rest.
Chap. HI.
The name of that baby was John

Britain, it is gene rally understood, will never go
u nder so long as her people hang on to the Bible,
and the Established Chorch, and Freetrade, and
respect their betters, and go to service regularly,
and love their Queen and all her German relatives
and hangers-on. The orthodox British Christian,
in fact, considers that his country has reached a
point of advancement which other nations would
do well to emulate, and his great effort is to bo:st
the little heathen up to his own standpoint. The
Parisian Petit Journal heard, in common with
the rest of the world, of these charitable en-
deavours, and sent over a representative to s' udy
the social life of London—the great city which
sends out hundreds ot thousands of pounds an-
nually with a view to teaching the Hindoo and
the African the joint beauties of holiness and
rum. And this is what he writes :—
It is known that at this moment famine reigns in the heart
of London; every day bands of people, emaciated, ragged,
or almost without clothicg, run the streets, demanding with
savage cries, work or bread Up to the present order has not
been disturbed, but terrible troubles are to be apprehended
before long; they will burst out with the cold, which will
augment this hideous misery. Lately, when the first
riotous murmurings were heard, the weather was fine. The
sun, which loves England but little, smiled upon London
while the starving howled. With the return of the fcg
the number of the suffering will double, and the move-
ments of the populace multiply, becoming more
and m - rs menacing and terrible. Ah, the wretched of
London! Their hell his often te n deeciibed, but there is no
pen that could adequately depict their degradation and their
torture. In the most miserable quarters ore encounteis at
each step the gin-shops, brilliant Assonmoirs, display ing the
tinsel of their gildings soiled by their filthy customers There I
crowds ff children in tatters came to fetch in chipned
saucers, pieces of teapots, and in remnants ot vessels cf all
kinds the gin for which their parents are waiting—the gin
which maddens and kills, but which at least makes them
forget for an hour the misery, without hope, in which they
are plunged There, all day and all the evening, women
frightfully ragged, standing their elbows on the counter,
drink till they fall, or until they have not a penny left
wherewith to ask fcr another glass cf spirits. This applies
equally to the men, who hold with them most hide -us con-
versation. In proximity to these liquor estaHismnents are
shops where food is sold—small pieces of meat, half rotten;
mixtures of straw and tobacco, deteri rated herrings, rotten
eggs, biscuits spotted by the flies, fragments of cheese, the
sight and smell of which makes one heave with disgust—
such are tie victuals and dainties which compose the menus
of the most easy of thete quarters of the populace.

THE land is the best ever yet submitted by
subdivision around Melbourne, and it is
admittedly the acme and perfection of the most
fashionable, the healthiest, the most charming,
and the most romantic spot ot Toorak, which, it
is needless to say, stands without a rival amongst
the suburbs of Melbourne. The Estate, which is
surrounded by Marsh ns, has a beautifully pano-
ramic view. For accessibility to the City the
Estate excels all other fashionable residential sites.
By road It is about I. 1 , miles from tbo Post-cilice ;
by rail it Is considerably less. The Glen Iris Rail-
way branches off from Burnley, and after travel-
ling one mile and three-quarters reaches the Rail-
way Sta'inn to be er< e'ed on Mr. Fergus on’s pro-
perty at the Glenferrie-road. This St rtion is two
minutes’ walk from the GREAT TOORAK
ES I ATE. By rail the Cl y will be reached from
your breakfast table comfortably in fifteen
minutes. The Toorak IT am, now in course of
construction, will take you from the heait of the
City to within eight minutes’ walk of the Estate
for Threepence, and the omnibuses from the Tram
Terminus to Malvern pass the Estate. Gas and

A Good Remedy for a Cold —On going to bed take

feeble to a full, elastic one, a good night’s sleep is obtaine<
and on waking in the morning the cold will be found to hat
disap;earered. The certainty of the action of Freeman
Chlorodyne is very remarkable in Ague; it frequently pr<
vents an attack, or, failing this, reduces the violence of th
ague fit to a minimum. In many countries Freeman
Chlorodyne has entirely superseded the use of Quinine, an<
in the tea gardens of India no*hing else is given for Ago

NINE FEET AND SOME ODD INCHES
Is the length of the spring which runs the far-
famed Waterbury Watch. This information may
be relied on, and Is supplied for the use of the
funny people who are afflicted with a desire to
work up some rew jokes on the subiect; and a
few fresh ones are hopefully looked for by the
many millions of wearers of that m ist excellent
timekeeper. If the length of the spring were

“jewels” were stuffed into the inside of a Water-
bury it would then more newly approach the
architectural magnificence of ths patent go as-

English lever” made in Switzerland for the ex-
press purpose of filling the State lunatic asylums
with hopeless Imbeciles. But, alas I it would
cease to be “ The Waterbary ” and would thence-
forth and forever resemble them also in the matter
of its performances. It you don’t know from ex-
perience the marvellous accuracy of the Water,
bury as a timekeeper, buy one—without any re-
gard to the length of the spring—for 13a. 6d. from

LATEST REVELATIONS.
Mr. W. R. Allen, of 9 Winkfleld-road, Balaam-
street, Plalstow, London (E-), writes;—“l desire
to inform you that my father-in-law, Mr Thomas
Wood, of Hill House, Offnam, near West Mailing,
Kent, has received great benefit from using St.
Jacob’s Oil. His case was that of a sprain in the
ankle, from which he suffered a great amount of
pain; he had tried various remedies without
avail. As I had heard a great many people speak
highly of St Jacob's Oil as a remedy for all pain-
ful ailments, I procured a bottle and sent down to
him, the contents of which ha had used several
times, with the result that in a day or two the
pain and swelling from wh'ch he had suffered were
entirely removed. The ankle became well and
strong as ever, and although this was several
months ago, there has been no sign of the pain
returning."
Mr. E, F. Painter, of the London Athletio Club
and Ranelagh Harriers, suffered from -a sprained
tendon for three month®, no remedies which he
tried doing him any good. A quick cure was,
however, effected by Sb. Jacob's Oil, and he was
able to resume his running and athletic sports.
The Bicycling News, London, says that St.
Jacobs Oil is without doubt one of the most use-
ful articles a wheelman can have in case of a
sprain or bruise.
Mr. T. Bann, 45 Stonehill-atreet, Anil eld,

neuralgia and the pain left me after one rubbing.'*
