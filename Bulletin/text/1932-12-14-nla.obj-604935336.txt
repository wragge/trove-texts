National Songs
In response to The Bulletin's call for a
National Song 1174 were received; and
they take a good deal of judging. It had
been hoped that it would be possible to
name the prize entries in this issue; but the
great response to the call made this quite
impossible. The work of reading and weigh-
ing is, however, well advanced; and it
may be completed before the 21st. If it is,
the results will be announced in The
Bulletin of that date.
The history of the Competition can be
told in a few words. Hitherto Australia has
had no national song as Canada has; even
in-the schools of Australia different so-
called national songs are sung in different
States. In his travels abroad Mr. J. Me-,
Rae, Acting-Director of Education in Vic-
toria, was struck by the fervor with which
the Canadian song was sung in t he- .schools
throughout the Dominion, and he decided
to move the next Conference of Directors
of Education to choose one song for all
Australia. As many things have happened
since “There Is a Land,” for instance, was
written, it was suggested that, before a
final choice was made, new songs should be
invited ; and at the directors’ conference
in Sydney three months ago the matter was
left to The Bulletin. To stimulate com-
petition it offered prizes of £25, £lO and £5.
Whether any song has been produced sur-
passing those already available will have
to be decided later: if nothing of very
great value is forthcoming it may be
set down to the fact that it is not easy to
write in cold blood a fervid patriotic song.
Nevertheless, it can be said quite definitely
that many of those submitted have merit.
On this page to-day we give a few of them,
some because they seem rather better than
most, others for various reasons.
There is simplicity and directness about
this one:—
Most of them are more consciously ambi-
tious than that. This, for instance:—
I here is poetry in many of them. Of this
group a good example has no other title
than “Song”:—
’There is deep religious feeling in a
large proportion of the entries. Many of
their writers submit their contributions as
a ‘‘national anthem,” though, since, already
we have “God Savq the King,” it was
thought better to ask for “n National Song,
suitable for use in schools.and elsewhere.”
Of the professed anthem class this may be
quoted:— ■
Some writers kept the school use most
m view: that would account for the pre-
vailing quality in this one:—
One seems to see the . Canadian influence
in this:—
Another national qttthein’’ ran into an
VGrSe and five °^ hoivs: tlirt>e of thq^e
Another of the simple and direct type;
and this one gives us the waratah as well
as the wattle, which may not be all an
advantage considering the small area of
Australia in which the waratah grows:
There is a rather surprising number of
“marching songs” in the collection—these,
too, no doubt, writers who had their eye
on the schools. One may be quoted:—
Of course, the war has left its mark on
very many of the verses; and whether too
pointed a reference to it does not “date”
the effort and detract from its value as
a national song for all time is a matter
for consideration. One of the most out-
standing follows:
And in the same class:—
But they are not all like the dozen that
have been quoted. Other writers have quite
different ideas about what a national song
should be. Thus:— .
Or this:—
the Competition, as expected, produced
some courageous efforts to fit Australia into
the rhymes! This man was as valiant as
any:— '
There will be some people, of course, who
will say that it isn’t suitable for use in
schools. Yet it might be. Much worse
things have been sung there.
AUSTRALIA.
Dear land of sunshine, wide and free,
Encircled by an azure sea,
We lift our voice in praise of thee—
Australia!
Deep-flowing streams and mountain rills,
With fertile fields and verdant hills.
Where golden wattle perfume spills,
Australia!
The sternest tests her sons have braved
Where’er her star-crossed flag has waved,
And for our heritage have saved
Australia!
Fair daughter of an Empire grand,
United in her cause we stand.
Cod bless our glorious Southern Land—
Australia!
WHITE HEATHER.
MOTHER OF ALL.
We kneel at her feet, we kneel,
. From the light and shadow we come,
And our ears are strained in the night
For the call of her trumpet and drum.
Broken and old and grey,
Wibrant and young and strong,
We kneel at her feet, we kneel,
And our prayer, is the flame of a song!
Australia, mother of all!
Hold us close to your heart
In joy and defeat, in pride and despair,
In life and in death, though apart.
And the blood of our blood shall awaken,
Shall flame to your trumpet call
When the storm of the battle is round your
hills,
Australia, mother of all!
We pray at her feet, we pray,
Line on line of her sons,
The quick from the life at her breast,
The dead from the roads of her guns.
Her warm brown hand caresses
Each bowed and" misty head;
We pray at her feet, our prayer
Is the cry of the living and dead!
And faithful to her we stand
Down the faithless centuries,
All steady and fearless-eyed,-
By the gates of her destinies
And ever by time and tide,
And ever through right and wrong,
Ihe cry of our hearts leaps out
In the flame of a deathless song!

SONG.
Australians all, we’ve had a fall,
Our pride indeed is humbled.
Shall we as men sit down and groan,
Because our hopes have tumbled?
-Vo/ We'll use our discretion
To banish depression,
And add to our flag a crown.
We’ll make a confession,,
We’ll kill old Depression —
For you can’t keep Australians down!
Australians all, we’re tough and tall,
Our spirit still undaunted;
We’re just the same—our Anzac name
To all the world still flaunted !

AUSSIE COO-EE.
When I go to Heaven from this land I love,
Though I’ll surely accord with the law up
above,
I’ll ask the head angel for a body again,
And come here to Aussie earth-life to regain.
I'll pray to the angel, and he’ll say to me,
“You are much an earth spirit, so go on
your way ;
Yon hear the poo-00-00-00-00-00-00-ee,
A greeting, a call, a loved voice to obey!”
I ll tell the kind angel of this land so dear;
I’ll tell of the flowers and the birds and
he’ll hear
Aussie call, call to me,, he’ll hear* a coo-ee,
And he’ll say straight away, “Earth-soul,
you are free;
You’re one with that weird bird called
kookaburra;
So waft you afar down in Sunned vale to lie,
And hear a ba-ha-ha-hoo-hoo-ha-hoo-hoo-
lioo-hoo-ha-ha,
The call from God-Nature that brings you
from on high.”
PAPA BROWN.
CHEER UP, WHITE AUSTRALIA!
Australia bright and sunny,
The land of milk and honey,
Hampered now by little money,
But not at all depressed—
Cheer up, White Australia,
Come out in your regalia, »
You can never be a failure,
Your sons hereby attest!
Ever onward you are urging,
.’Midst the, worldly tumult surging,
But soon Will be emerging
Right out upon the crest.
“So cheer up, White Australia,
We love you, dear Australia!
If foreigners assail you.
Your sons will never fail you,
But gallantly aggress.
So cheer up, White Australia!
Your daughters too are daring,
No effort will be sparing;
Only for your welfare caring—
Their little hearts God bless!
And a few added gall to their ink:—
RECESSIONAL.
W e won the war—what a pity we won the
war! . , ■
Ask Billy Hughes—he kept the score.
We beat the German, Austrian and Turk,
Now we are marching around, out of work.
And what is it for?
We Won the war!
The next time an enemy is at the door,
W e will take him in and shake his hand.
Offer him a drink and call out the band.
What is the use of fighting any more?—
W e are out of work and we won the war!
“Are you working?” “No—are you?”
Who is working? B few !
Ho, ho, everywhere you go,
When you meet a’pal, you say “Heigh,
hello!
Are you working?’’ “No—are you’”
So give three cheers for the Red. White and
Blue! ,
“Are you working?” “No, you fool,
are you?”

• Before being passed for tyre
building, specimens are taken
from every batch of Perdriau
cord fabric and tested on the
above machine. The results of
the tests are automatically re-
corded and checked to ensure a
perfect co-ordination of high
tensile strength and elasticity.
• At certain intervals a tyre is
withdrawn from average produc-
tion for “torture” testing (see
illustration below). During a
period of days it is battered on
these giant cleated wheels run-
ning at high speed and dealt
out punishment which it would
not receive in a lifetime on the
roughest roads. Afterwards the
tyre is dissected for recording
its resistance.

STEPPING right ahead of ordinary tyre
construction, Perdriau offers, without any
increase in price, an improved tyre with a new
Double Triangle Tread. Into this new tread is
massed double the toughness that has built the
Perdriau reputation for harder work and longer
mileage . . . This double strength and stamina
is made possible by super compressing the
tread rubber and unvarying factory control
right through the production of every tyre . . .
Every one of these double tough Perdriaus
leaves the factory “passed 0.K.” - only after
a series of tests that mean perfection both in
raw materials and the finished tyre. See your
local dealer he will be pleased to quote for
your size of this improved Perdriau.

• The Perdriau tread is fed into this machine
(illustrated at left) and extruded by tremendous
pressure through a die. It comes through in a solid,
super-compressed section. This Perdriau process
eliminates all possibility of uneven tread construc-
tion and is important in giving the rubber its
unequalled toughness.
• The Perdriau Tyre is justly famed for its ability
to resist ply separation. Here is proof! Sections
are frequently taken from tyres selected at random
and given the “flexing test.” The machine shown
below, by driving strips backwards and forwards
on a cambered shaft, reproduces in an exaggerated
form the flexing action that every tyre receives on
the road.

FACTS !
The only type of
circulation tHat
has real worth is that which is constant and
embodies the confidence of readers. These
attributes are possessed only by the daily
newspapers whose circulations are derived, not
by contests, insurance schemes, or high pres-
sure methods, but by real merit. They are
bought because people want them in their
homes.
The daily newspaper
is so essential
to the New Zealander that even in times of
economic stress he continues to buy his
morning daily, so valuable is it for the
information it gives, both in its news and
advertisement columns.
Newspaper advertising is the most economical,
effective and forcible medium for reaching
the New Zealand public.

F.N.R.: Of course rabbits have cost Australia
millions. So has fire. But fire under control is a
blessing; and The B. was talking about rabbits
“under control.” The man who has fire under

“GOODWILL.”
Once a year we preach goodwill; but we
might seriously ask ourselves whether in
doing it we are not great humbugs and
hypocrites—whether, in fact, there is not
already more goodwill than suits us, and
whether our best efforts are not directed
towards reducing the supply and creating
ill-will in its place.
In a N.S.W. law court a few weeks
ago the “publicity agent” of the late Lang
Government, retracting some libels on
various private persons, explained through
his counsel that he had never seriously
intended the charges; he had made them
only for political purposes. A few days
afterwards his late chief, called to order
in the Assembly for traducing the acting
leader of the Government, pleaded that he
had nothing to withdraw or apologise for,
because he had only meant it politically.
From these and a multitude of other cir-
cumstances it is evident that many of us
regard politics as something to which the
ordinary rules of conduct do not apply:
what would be highly defamatory in other
relations is regarded in public life as com-
monplace, and in no way reprehensible. And
when we say politically, what we mean in
these days is industrially—that is to say,
as employers or employees.
There is scarcely a Parliamentary elec-
tion nowadays in which this method of
attack is not practised; and it is carried
more or less through every Parliament,
Even the world depression, we are told, is
merely part of a great conspiracy to win
back from the workers the things which
they have gained during the past few years.
Precisely the same method of attack that
is employed by the Trades Hall against its
political opponents is employed by the
United Front and similar organisations
against the Trades Hall. “What struggle
has the Water Board Union ever been in in
the interests of the toiling masses?” the
“Official Organ of the United Front” asked
lately. “Its functions are to create a feel-
ing of harmony between the Board and us,
its slaves; and to collect dues off the
workers with which to keep paid the officers’
fat salaries.” Since political attack con-
sists so largely of charges against oppo-
nents—charges which those who make them
know to be false—is it surprising that we
are surrounded by suspicion and ill-will
and hate? For, unfortunately, only the few
realise that the charges are deliberately
false: the vast majority—the rank and file
—are persuaded that their opponents are
all they have been said to be.
This shameless lying is at the bottom of
the class-consciousness which is the most
distressing feature of the age. The em-
ploying “class” is regarded vaguely as
some monster with no bowels of compas-
sion interested only in squeezing out the
last possible ounce of labor and paying for
it the least possible money, entirely without
concern for anything but its own profits.
On the other side the working “class” is
vaguely regarded as another sort of mon-
ster squeezing out the uttermost farthing
of wages for the smallest possible return
in labor. The average employee does not
put his own boss in this category; nor does
the average employer put his own em-
ployees. With exceptions, of course, the
employee finds his own employer a very
decent chap, anxious to do a fair thing by
his workmen; and to an even greater extent
the employer finds his own employees eager
to do a fair thing and responding to fair
treatment. But each is ready to accept,
not the good testimony of his own experi-
ence, but the evidence of the party poli-
tician. And we have seen what sort of
evidence that is liable to be.
Ours is not a country where a ! great gulf
is fixed between employer and worker.
Almost every employer is a worker, too,
with strong sympathy for other workers.
He seeks to make a profit, it is true; but
he believes that a fair return on capital is
as indispensable for labor as it is for capital.
Capital is accumulated profit, and some-
body must accumulate it in order to pro-
vide the tools of labor and to carry labor
on until the job, whatever it is, becomes
productive. The leaders of the great experi-
ment in Russia saw all this, and,
further, that capital can be got only by
putting by some of the product. They set
out to make the State the capitalist. But,
in fact, who nominally owns what is put by
matters very little. The Russian workmen
would not be a penny either better or
worse off if Lenin had died a millionaire;
it would not make the smallest difference
to them if, instead of the profit which is
being put aside to-day belonging nominally
to the State, it belonged nominally to
Stalin. Those who believe in individualism
believe in it not because it may be good
for themselves, but because it seems to
them best for the community in spite of
its occasional failures—best for the work-
man, because it gives the most encourage-
ment to everybody to put forward his best
endeavors; because it produces Henry
Fords, and encourages them to use their
great talents for the extension of industry
and the improvement of the earnings and
therefore the possible wages of the workers.
So the world is not the cold, selfish, in-
considerate place that political leaders try
to make us believe it is in order to gain
their own ends; and it seems that the
first duty of those who do honestly want
to promote goodwill is to deal definitely
with those who, under the cloak of party,
attempt to destroy this thing which is so
much to be desired. We need to teach
these men that to create personal ill-will
for the purpose of cultivating class hatred
is a crime compared with which defamation
for merely personal reasons is of small im-
portance. But something more even than
that is called for; we shall not get far
towards destroying the forces that make
for ill-will and suspicion and hate until we
completely reform our system of wage-
fixing. We have set up an elaborate system
of so-called arbitration, which consists
largely of manufacturing disputes, and
making ridiculous claims and equally ridi-
culous counter-claims, and we support those
claims and counter-claims with charges and
counter-charges, well knowing them to be
exaggerated, but trusting that some of the
mud we throw will stick. If these exaggera-
tions were breathed only into the ear of
a tribunal, no great harm might be done;
unfortunately they arc widely published—
these deliberately exaggerated stories of in-
justices and evasions—and add greatly to
the ill-will on w'hicli class-consciousness
depends for its being.
And when all is said and done, what are
the workers really getting out of it? They
have been told about the enormous gains
in wages, etc., which our arbitration system
has won for them. It is a gold brick.
Wages, have barely kept pace with the
rise in the cost of living. The promotion
of ill-will has got them nowhere. They
might well try what goodwill would do for
them.
AN OVERLOOKED COLOR PROBLEM.
Australia is developing a color problem of
its own in Queensland, and the solution is
not easy. In the early years of the sugar
industry it was not believed possible that
white men could do the field work, and
kanaka labor was “blackbirded” from the
Pacific Islands. -During the distressful ’nine-
ties white labor was, however, driven to
accept many jobs which it had before turned
down; it thus went into the canefields in
increasing; numbers, and proved that it
could do the work without damage to its
health. Black labor in the industry always
had been strongly opposed by those of us
who were working for a White Australia;
and the proof that the industry was not
dependent upon black labor turned the
scale definitely against it.
As soon, therefore, as Federation had
been accomplished two measures were put
before the new Parliament—one the Immi-
gration Restriction Bill, the other the Pacific
Island Laborers Bill, the latter providing for
the repatriation of kanakas as far as was
compatible with the dictates of humanity.
These measures were followed by an Exemp-
tion Act which set out more specifically
those whom “the dictates of humanity” ex-
cluded from repatriation : it provided that
leave to remain in Queensland might be
granted, on application, to kanakas who had
been residing in Australia continuously for
20 years; those who had married into an-
other tribe and whose lives would be en-
dangered if they returned to their own
island; those who through age or infirmity
seemed incapable of making a living if they
were repatriated; those who were regis-
tered owners of freeholds and those who
had married white women. It is rather
startling to learn now that under these ex-
emptions no fewer than 1580 out of a total
kanaka population of 5971 remained in
Queensland —the number in 1891 had been
9362, but white labor and the certainty of
anti-kanaka legislation had gradually re-
duced the number. Many of those left
behind were married; and in the past 25
years there has been a rapid growth of
kanaka population. Thus in Mackay, ac-
cording to the Presbyterian missioner, the
Rev. A. Asboe, there has been a fourfold
increase.
The position of these people is now en-
tirely unsatisfactory. Says Mr. Asboe in
an appeal to this paper:
As things have turned out, those who were
returned to their islands are better off, and happier,
than those now resident in our State. With the
many restrictions imposed on those domiciled in
Queensland, living as they do from hand to mouth,
disregarded on the labor market, dependent on
Government doles, State aid and relief work, these un-
fortunate people are unwanted and receive little or
no consideration on account of the unbridguble
gulf of color.
Inevitably there is a certain amount of
intermingling with the whites, almost always
to the harm of both races. The kanaka and
half-caste children, attend the State schools
with the whites, and numerous instances of
gross immorality and shocking practices
among the colored children have been re-
ported. The exemptions, which were
humanitarian in their genesis, have turned
out to be a disaster and a nasty, growing
sore.
We shall have to do what we recoiled
from doing 30 years ago. Segregation is
demanded, in the interests of the kanakas
as of the whites; but segregation on the
mainland is impracticable. Mr. Asboe’s
own solution—and he probably knows the
kanaka mind and what these people are
capable of better than any other person-
is that they shall be established on some
fertile island, where they may be taught the
arts and skill of their forefathers, to fit
them for life in a natural environment,
protected from the intrusion and exploita-
tion of the white man. It is not too much
to ask. We tried the other way; and it is
to our credit that we did try it. But it
has failed, and it is an obligation laid upon
us to turn now to the only plan which
seems to hold out much hope of success.
Put on the low ground of money cost, we
shall almost without question find it the
cheapest way out.
THE BIRTH OF WORDS.
“Did you ever try'yo-yo, Herbert?” some-
one called from the Hill to an English bats-
man in a recent dull over of a very dull
cricket match; and the roar of laughter
showed that there could have been very few
present who did not know what yo-yo was.
It may be the toy will go out as ping-
pong did; but if it does it looks a.s though
it may leave its name behind it—as ping-
pong also did. Every year sees either some
new sounds added to the language or new
meanings given to old sounds.
It might have been thought that the
language would be more static in these
days when everything is put into print. On
the contrary, there is overwhelming evi-
dence that a printed language is far more
changeful than the spoken; and if we want
to get old forms and words used with their
old meanings we must go to those parts
which know and have known the printing
press least. The newspaper is the great
innovator. We are apt to think of a journal
as a single voice, striving to make itself
heard above a babel ol voices by reason
of its news or its political or literary judg-
ments or its art or its sport. But a news-
paper is something more than that: it is
in itself a multitude of voices, each strain-
ing to catch the ear of the’ conductor, all
trying to offer something different. It is
inevitable that in such fierce competition
new twists will be given to old words and
an occasional new word will be added.
We may generally judge a period by
the character of the words which either
come fresh into the language or, with a
new meaning or an old one, reach a popu-
larity they have never had before. The
war-time was rich in these inventions. It
gave us, above all, “Digger” and “Anzac,”
the origin of the one in doubt, the other
coming to us by the same sort of accident
that added “Bawra” to the language,
though maybe that one will not persist.
Most of such words go with the circum-
stances that brought them into being.
“Blighty” may last, though in its sense of
a wound sufficiently serious to call for a
trip to England it has already had its day;
and no longer does anyone “come a
Cadorna”—the very name of the unfortu-
nate general is forgotten.
After the war came “mandates” and “man-
datories ’ and “sanctions”—no new words,
but old ones familiarised in their new appli-
cations. And after the peacei the boom—
unfruitful except in relation to new material
inventions. We already had the “movies”;
now we were to get the “talkies.” With
these things came the jargon of the “studio”
and the “location”—the “black-out” and the
“close-up.” Came, too, with the products
of Hollywood, a new use of “release.” No
word of the period has sprung into wider
employment. It is not only the “picture”
that is marked “for release” on a certain
date; statements made by Prime Ministers
and the League of Nations are circulated
with the same condition. The “stunt,”
too, has, it seems, come to stay; in very
limited use before the war—practically con-
fined to the theatre—during the war it was
applied to almost any performance, but
especially the more or less spectacular, and
in that sense it still lasts. Yet, curiously
enough, it seems never to have crossed over
into the American lines; Dr. Vizetelly,
the American, who has made a collection of
such words, does not mention it.
Aviation, besides doing most to famil-
iarise us with “stunting,” gave us also the
“hangar”; and that looks as though it
might be Oriental. But actually it is one
of those old English words which had some-
how fallen into disuse; as long ago as 1600
it was. described as “an open shed or hoveil,
wherein husbandmen set their plouglies’
etc.”; and Thackeray, in “Esmond,” men-
tions it as the place wherein a coach was
kept.
After the war and the peace and the
boom came the reckoning; and that has had
its jargon, too. It was the banker Nie-
meyer, brought to advise us, who told us
that our affairs were “out of equilibrium”;
and ever since there has been a clatter
about “credits,” and “inflation” and “de-
flation” and at last “reflation,” and “money
wages” and “real wages” and—amidst a host
of others—“rationalisation.” Most of them
are words used because we dare not employ
simpler ones; words we use in the effort to
pull wool over our own and other people s
eyes, so that they need not look at the
facts; as, for example, when we talk glibly
and superiorly of “frozen credits” and mean
bad debts. Some day we shall ask our-
selves whether it would not have been
better if we had called in fewer profes-
sional economists in these difficult days
and depended more upon plain business
men of the George Turner type who had
no word for spade except spade.
So far as the past year is concerned, no
syllable has exercised us more than “hike’ ;
because it sounded American, and because
America was not very popular at the
moment, it was regarded with much dis-
favor. Yet, like “hangar,” it is of ancient
British birth. Indeed, the common use of
words in America—and especially in the
west —which have fallen more or less into
disuse in England illustrates what was said
just now about the spoken language being
the more static. “Buddy” looks pure
American, as American as our “cobber” is
Australian; but it is a mere corruption of
the common English “butty,” which we
have ourselves applied to working gangs;
and “buddie” is in the dialect of Bobbie
Burns. Our friends beyond the Pacific
have, in fact, clung to many forms from
which we have slipped in course of time,
and they therefore have something to sup-
port their rather startling claim that theirs
is the purer English. Thus we have that
Dr. Vizetelly whom we have already named—
and who, incidentally, in his latest
volume acknowledges his indebtedness
to The Bulletin for its co-operation—
claiming that in calling it “skedule” his
countrymen merely speak the tongue that
Shakspeare spoke. “To show the people
of his day how the word should be pro-
nounced,” he writes, “Shakspeare spelled
it 'scedule’ (1595) and it was so printed in
the First Folio edition of his works—
What’s here, the portrait of a blinking idiot,
Presenting me a scedule ?”
And as for “cheque”—well, says Vizetelly,
now stirred almost to anger, “the word
'check’ is more than 562 years old. The
spelling 'cheque/ an innovation of an illiter-
ate person, has been in use in England just
99 years. The contention that 'cheque’ is
not synonymous with 'check’ is absurd—
'cheque’ is an English misspelling of
'check.’ ”
NATIONAL SONGS.
A study of the entries for The Bulle-
tin's National Song Competition, on which
the judges are now at work, provides a
lesson in the remarkable capacity of human
beings for thinking and expressing them-
selves along almost identical lines. In spite
of early closing, six o’clock closing, com-
pulsory voting, the passport system, adminis-
tration by innumerable Boards, and dozens
of other examples that might be cited of
the tyrannies of elected persons and civil
servants, there appears to be a practically
universal impression that Australians are
freer than the inhabitants of other coun-
tries. Also superior on the moral side.
Australia, my country, of thee I sing.
Land of the noble and free.
And again:—
Australia, Australia,
Land of the brave and free.
Australia, Australia,
We are proud of thee.
Over 50 per cent, of the songs stress the
essential bravery and freedom of Austra-
lians, and droves of them use “country”
at the end of at least one line, and pro-
nounce it “coun tree.”
Australia! Australia!
Who stands for the name of Australia?
I stand for you and you for me
United in justice to our country.
Another big section is composed of songs
in the metre of the British National
Anthem.
Stand strong, our native land,
For God and right.
Administer wise laws,
Maintain the fight.
Your honor is your pledge,
Our faith your due,
And righteousness the path
That we pursue.
Almost without exception these writers
reveal that recent findings by Royal Com-
missioners and others have not affected
their conviction that Australians, as regards
righteousness, anyhow, are the salt of the
earth.
In a batch of 122 songs, taken at random,
there were .29 references to “golden grain,”
34 to “land of the free,” 36 to “land of sun-
shine” (or “sun”), 40 to “azure sea”
(“lapped,” “girdled,” “hemmed” and
“cradled by”), and there were no less than
82 references to “home,” more than half
of them in conjunction with “where’er I
roam.” The poets find no place like home
where’er they roam across the foam.
Little attention, relatively speaking, is paid
to the native flora and fauna, though the
“gold of the wattle” or the “wattle’s gold”
is the subject of about a dozen songs, and
one verse from “A Coo-ee Long, a Coo-ee
Strong” runs:—
No place do we know,
No place can we see,
To compare with our land of the old gum-tree.
The laughing Jack, the ’Possum too,
The Emu and the Kangaroo.
Speaking generally, the Australian writer of
patriotic .songs seems to be troubled with
derivativeness. It is the rarest thing to
catch the sound of a wild new note which
is racy of Australia. But, then, that is a
rare experience in the patriotic verse of
any country or age.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
Overseas Trade Figures.
At the end of October, 1931, as the result
of four months’ trading, we had a balance
in our favor of £7,253,000 sterling. At the
end of October, 1932, we had a balance of
only £2,187,000 in our favor. Our exports
of both merchandise and gold were slightly
better—they had increased by £1.220,000;
but our imports had increased by no less
than £6,286,000. We had thus fallen back
£5,066,000 in four months. It is too early
yet to say definitely what that means;
but we shall have to watch our trade figures
very carefully. Two things can be done if
they get out of hand: a percentage in-
crease of duty can be imposed to curb
imports; or the exchange rate can be raised.
The former plan has much to recommend
it. It is better than a primage duty, inas-
much as it falls most heavily on those
goods which we can best do without, judg-
ing by the existing rate of duty, and it
leaves quite untouched those goods which
we have declared should come in duty free
—raw materials for our manufacturing
industries, for instance. For exactly the
same reasons it is better than a higher
exchange rate.
The Commonwealth Bank return offers
more comfort than the overseas trade
figures. As we have seen, the latter showed
that in four months we had built up a
balance of only £2,187,000 towards our
public interest bill of, say, £28,000,000 per
annum. We should therefore have already
called heavily on that surplus of money in
London which was built up last year. Actu-
ally, however, there has been no such call,
and at the beginning of December the
bank still had nearly 15 millions in London.
It may be that payments are not being
made for some of the imports that Aus-
tralia is receiving—that, rather than lose
the enormous sums which transfer from
Australia to, say, New York would involve,
oil and other cos. are leaving some of their
money in Australia. Otherwise the only
explanation can be that the trade statistics
are wrong. Quantity figures, however,
make it quite clear that there has been a
serious increase of imports; and that is
a very disturbing movement.

An Open Go for Communists.
In other parts of the world attacks on
foreign consulates, attempts to seduce
soldiers from their allegiance and advo-
cacy of or organisation for the overthrow
of existing institutions (including the insti-
tution of property) by force are regarded as
grave offences and drastically punished.
Aliens who practise these parts of the
gospel according to Lenin are run out of
Canada and the U.S.A., and not allowed
to return. Their native-born confederates
are, on conviction, imprisoned for long
terms. It is held that persons who seek to
impose on a free English-speaking people
a system invented by a German Jew and
thrust, after frightful bloodshed, on semi-
Oriental serfs, 80 per cent, illiterate, are
not fit to enjoy the liberties that their
fathers won for them, and that gaol is their
proper place.
There is none of this sternness in Aus-
tralia. The feeling rather is that anyone,
alien or native-born, has a right to be
a trumpeter of sedition so long as he be-
longs to a “working-class organisation,”
members of “working-class organisations”
being privileged. Should a trumpeter of
sedition get into trouble, his counsel, as
likely as not, will characterise the prosecu-
tion as “an insult to ‘the movement,’ ”
“the movement” being the new privileged
aristocracy. And in the rare event of a
conviction being recorded, the member of
the “working-class organisation” may ex-
pect to be let down lightly by a soft-
hearted Judge or magistrate.
In the course of a typical Communist
“protest against war,” a Sydney mob tried
to rush the Japanese Consulate. One of
the rioters was arrested after he had
assaulted two policemen who were pro-
tecting the representatives of a great and
friendly Power; he was fined £5 on one
charge and £2 on a second, in default 14
days. A former lieutenant and gunner was
found guilty of having disseminated sediti-
ous literature and tried to seduce a private
from his duty. “Why don’t you chuck
your uniform at your officer?” he said.
“Why don’t you chuck it in the gutter?”
Said the Judge: “It is a serious thing to
try to undermine the loyalty of soldiers.
You are bound over to be of good behavior
for two years.” The publisher of a Com-
munist newspaper was convicted of having
solicited subscriptions for the Communist
party of Australia, “an unlawful associa-
tion which advocated or encouraged the
overthrow of the established Government of
the Commonwealth by force or violence.”
He appealed, and four High Court Justices
(Rich, J., dissenting) held that the con-
viction could not stand. As the report
says, the order of the Court was: “Appeal
allowed; conviction quashed; information
dismissed with costs; informant to pay
costs of appeal.”
Said Justice Evatt: “The very name of
this Crimes Act challenges inquiry. Un-
like the Dominion of Canada, the Com-
monwealth does not possess general juris-
diction over the domain of criminal law.
So, although perpetuity is implied in all
Constitutions, even ours, it is doubtful
whether the Commonwealth may pass
effective laws for its own preservation from
those who would violently destroy it.
4
The Moratorium.
The man who introduces a moratorium
introduces trouble; for the thing cannot be
done without treading heavily on the toes
of perfectly innocent persons. In N. S.
Wales it was, of course, right into the hands
of J. T. Lang. He was out after the tall
poppies; and a tall poppy was anybody
not in politics who had saved up money
and lent or otherwise invested it. Especi-
ally malevolent were “the great fnanshul
instooshuns.” A measure to relieve people
from paying great fnanshul instooshuns and
other tall poppies was therefore rushed
through with enthusiasm. And so many
people saw they would benefit by it that
warnings and protests were almost drowned.
It is very doubtful whether we should
have had anything to do with a mora-
torium when Bavin first mentioned it to
N. S. Wales. Certainly this is to be pleaded:
through the failure of gold to do its job as
a standard of value, the price-level of
commodities has been so unstable that,
whereas a debtor undertook to pay 500
bushels of wheat by way of, say, interest,
to-day he is called upon to pay 1200 bushels.
But even that would not of itself justify the
State in tearing up contracts —and mort-
gages, of course, are contracts. Men knew,
or should have known, that such price-
variations were probable. Hundreds of
warnings were given about it. This paper,
among others, declared that a heavy fall
was inevitable. There were men who saw
clearly what was coming, sold their Aus-
tralian property and in some instances sent
the proceeds out of Australia. What
occurred was, therefore, not unforeseeable.
The question is whether the State is under
any obligation, or even has any right, to
save men from the unpleasant consequences
of bad bargains which they might have
avoided. In ordinary circumstances there
seems to be no question whatever that the
State should take no hand in the matter.
It would only be justified in interfering
to avert a national catastrophe.
This Government and its faithful heeler,
the “S. M. Herald,” have talked a great
deal about the principles involved. No
principles are involved: the only possible
excuse for action is that it is expedient.
Hence most of what was heard when the
Government resisted certain amendments
made by the Leg. Council was mock-
heroics. The “S. M. Herald” said: “That
a mortgagor who, through no fault of his
own, is unable to meet his dues should be
granted a respite in these times of stress
cannot be denied.” But as for guarantors—
over whom most of the trouble arose—
“what grievance have they if held to their
self-sought bargain?” If it is expedient
to release the mortgagor, the only question
to consider is whether it is expedient to
release the guarantor also. There is no
matter of principle about it. We leave
principles behind when we begin to play
with contracts and agreements.

The Crime of Being 18.
As can be certified by anyone who is in a
position to know—heads of _ commercial
schools especially—it is almost impossible to
get any but laborer’s work for a boy once he
has passed his eighteenth birthday. The
request is always the same: “Don’t send
us anyone over 15 or 16.” The reason is
always the same, too; boys of 18 have
to be paid a salary altogether disproportion-
ate to the value of the work they are called
upon to do, or which they are capable of
doing, and in most cases much more than
a business in' these times can afford to pay
to a raw beginner. And—the chief stumb-
ling block—a boy of 18i, starting fresh
from school, must get a man’s full wage
after he has been working for 21 years.
So the well-educated, well-mannered, ambi-
tious and eager youth, with his Leaving or
Leaving Honors Certificate, is passed over
in favor of a younger and less qualified
boy, and compelled to walk the streets in
enforced idleness, learning the bitter lesson
that in this country there is no room for
him because he is 18. Is it any wonder the
ranks of Communism are growing?
And what a reflection on our common-
sense ! On the one hand, we have
an enormously expensive system of primary
and secondary education, capable of taking
charge of the intellectual development of
our youths up to the age of 18, a system
of which we frequently boast. Oh the other
hand we have a system which compels em-
ployers to pay a fixed wage, irrespective
of ability, according to age—a system of
which we also frequently boast—so that
they naturally refuse to employ a youth
who has takgn full advantage of the educa-
tional facilities which they are taxed to
provide.
Protection and the Farmer.
Our freetrade friends have been deeply
interested in finding reasons why bonuses
and bounties should not be given to farmers,
and especially wheat-farmers. “When the
world (as last year) is producing 338,000,000
bushels more than can be sold, to encourage
inefficient farmers, or farmers in unsuitable
areas, to persevere in trying to grow wheat
for profit is,” the “S. M. Herald” lately
said, “ridiculous.” And of course it is
ridiculous. But what are we going to do
with the men? For this is not a question
of reducing costs. It is one of the very few
cases of over-production. There simpiy are
too many wheat-farmers in the world ; and,
instead of wanting more, the world will
want less. It is safe to say that one man
to-day is growing and harvesting as much
wheat as two could 40 years ago; and
chemical and mechanical science will prob-
ably make as much difference in the next
40 as they have in the past 40 years.
The wheat-growing business never has
been a very profitable one; the supply
has always been too great or the price has
been too small. Now the competition pro-
mises to be keener than ever it was. It
is no use trying to humbug ourselves into
the belief that the past few years have
been exceptional in that respect. The truth,
on the contrary, is that that enormous
potential producer, Russia, has been off
the market for the last few years and is
now preparing to re-enter it. Sweep away
every Customs duty, and the most we can
do thereby is to encourage the production
of more wheat to add to that huge surplus
which has been reaped every year for several
years past; we will merely shut up fac-
tories and throw men and women out of
employment and compel them to attempt
to live by growing more of this enormously
over-produced grain.
The farmer himself has been deluded
into joining in this cry for sweeping away
protectionist duties. Let him realise what
he faces. It is obviously absurd for him
in one breath to cry for a reduction of the
area oh wheat put under crop, in order to
diminish the over-production, and in the
next breath to ask for the abolition of
duties, which could only have the effect of
closing factories and driving men on to the
land, thus adding to the over-production.
♦
The Clerical Out-of-work.
The clerical worker and the lightweight
shop assistant call for much more con-
sideration than they have had. To a great
extent we made these men what they are.
They were the firstfruits of our borrow-
ing and importing boom superimposed upon
our education system; and when the bor-
rowing and importing boom burst, they
were the first to get the sack. Re-employ-
ment in their old jobs is almost hopeless;
it is very doubtful whether for many of
them their old jobs ever will exist again,
and it will be well for the country if they
don’t. But what is to become of the dis-
possessed? They are to-day submerged in
the army of unskilled laborers. The Relief
Departments—of the larger States at any
rate —do not know the clerical worker. The
tradesman registers as such, and when there
is work offering in his trade he is called
on to do it. All that the skilled clerk is
ever called on to do is general labor, for
most of which he is not only not specially
fitted but in most cases specially unfitted.
He cannot do it with any profit to his
employer, and generally it is an agony to
himself.
Yet, as a rule, he has more than average
intelligence, and would make good if we
could get him in the right place. There
is no right place for him in our present
circumstances except in small-farm settle-
ments. He would at least have a chance
there: he might find that the new life suits
him so well that he would outgrow the
settlement and, with his new knowledge to
help him, become a farmer on a larger
scale. He would at any rate be in the way
to learn a good deal about one of the most
interesting occupations in the world: an
occupation, moreover, in which it is possible
to make a richer competence than clerical
labor ever brought.
In Maoriland something is being done
in this way; in Australia, save for a few
efforts mainly by church enthusiasts, we
continue to potter on, looking vaguely
towards a recovery to get men back into
their old jobs, though those old jobs have
disappeared off the face of the earth.
«
The Advertising Hoarding.
Sydney's present outburst against the
advertising hoarding has greater advantages
than any of the multitude of outbursts that
have gone before it; and if anything is
to be done, no time is likely to be so
favorable for doing it. One by one the
sitands have dropped out of use, until
probably not one-tenth of those which
formerly disfigured the landscape in N. S.
Wales is being maintained. In many cases
they have been abandoned altogether, and
are more offensive in their decay than they
were in the days of their garish opulence;
and their smaller, meaner brother, who took
unauthorised possession of any tree from
which he might shriek his message at the
passer-by, is in his neglect and disrepair
a scar upon the face of the country. Other
States have expelled the hoarding and his
meaner brother from the country road; and
no harm will be done and much artistic
good will be achieved by following their
example in N. S. Wales. At no time will
vested interests opposing the reform be so
unimportant.
The aesthetic is, however, not the only
consideration. Trade must have its adver-
tisements; but since they can be made to
serve some useful public purpose, it is a
serious question whether those which do not
do so should be tolerated. The advt. in
the newspaper, for example, enables the
publisher to provide a service which other-
wise would be quite impossible. But for
their advertising pages the daily papers’
cable services would be out of the question.
But for its advertising pages, it would not
be possible for. the Christmas Bulletin
to give in original reading matter and
drawings more than sufficient to fill two
complete eight-and-sixpenny novels—-some-
thing like 170,000 words—and do it for
sixpence. The same can be said in a lesser
degx-ee for broadcasting. Part of the
revenue is used for the benefit of the
public; in the case of the newspapers,
often 95 per cent, of it. Nothing of that
kind can be pleaded on behalf of the
hoarding, whether it defiles a country land-
scape or raises itself in city or suburbs.
It brings no direct advantages such as come
from the newspaper advt. or even the wire-
less announcement; and it is a proper
question for public consideration whether
it should not be ruled out on that ground
alone.
Let’s Do Something.
Dear Bulletin, —If nobody will take up
the scheme you put forward for the issue
of Production Certificates, so that the un-
employed might employ themselves in pro-
viding for their own needs, what about the
plan that was suggested to the Vie. Govern- ■
ment about 18 months ago? It was given
no consideration then because everyone in
a responsible position said we were just
about to “turn the corner.” And it is so
much easier to do nothing.
At the present time the community sup-
plies the unemployed with some finished
goods and distributes them. It is the
simplest and most makeshift way out, but
it is not the way that would be adopted
by a community which was resolved to help
the unemployed to help themselves. The
money provided by the community should
be used to buy raw materials in bulk in
order that the labor of the unemployed
might be used to manufacture goods and
distribute them among themselves. To
do this efficiently a Surplus Labor Trust
was suggested, to be composed of men of
proved administrative ability giving volun-
tary service. In carrying out their work
they would ask for and no doubt receive
any specialised help that was needed. Suffi-
cient evidence has been given that all
classes are willing to give such help. The
Trust would acquire the use of factories,
lands and equipment, and would produce
articles of food and clothing required by
the unemployed. The labor of the unem-
ployed would be paid with production cer-
tificates, which could be liquidated at the
depots of th& Trust. These distributing
depots would be established in every centre
of population, and would, of course, be
equipped with delivery vehicles and other
means of effectively carrying out their work.
The local depots could be supervised by
voluntary committees acting under the
guidance of the Trust. The operations of
the Trust would include the growing of
vegetables; butcheries; bakeries; grocery
manufacture; clothing and boot manufac-
ture; distribution of goods; such other
activities as w T ould be suggested by experi-
ence.
The question of unemployment must be
faced, and ultimately there is no solution
apart from using the surplus labor to pro-
vide the goods so urgently required.—
Yours, W. B. Tas.

The Neglect of Thought.
“Pawang”: Melbourne University has just
provided a striking example of the conser-
vatism of educationists. Over 12,000 students
rolled up for the annual examination. One
boy broke his arm, but was allowed to
dictate his answers to a specially authorised
writer. Others fell sick, and overseers were
sent with the papers to their homes. Most
of this frenzy of competition has as much
to do with real mental development as
learning the new “Australian Year-Book”
backwards. The most brilliant students,
according to the examination returns, are,
as a rule, those with the greatest ability
to memorise facts which could easily be
got out of books when needed.
The spirit engendered by such exams,
survives in after-life. Take the medical
profession, for instance. The student who
has a meteoric career through the university
usually sets up in the end as a specialist.
He is at once plunged into frantic com-
petition for patients with his fellow-
specialists. His training haying largely
been concerned with the acquisition of that
sort of knowledge about which examiners
can ask definite questions to which orthodox
answers can be given, he has probably lost
all intellectual curiosity. This tends to
make him conservative. He usually be-
comes fashionable through the commercial-
ising of some particular kind of treatment;
and when badly-paid research workers have
conducted investigations which make the
treatment out of date, it is difficult to con-
vince him of the necessity of change. If
he still retains a thirst for real knowledge
he has no time to indulge it, but has to
depend on a perusal of new textbooks as
they come to hand. I know one specialist
who would dearly love to further his know-
ledge by individual research, but he dare
not stop to think, for his vogue would
pass, or some other • specialist, would grab
his trade, and then what would happen to
his expensive establishment and the state
which,* as a fashionable medicine-man, he
is obliged to keep up?
If intelligence tests were applied to aspir-
ants for university honors, there would be
a different condition of affairs. The really
intelligent boy would be distinguished from
the merely imitative, and the State would
be able to give him the facilities which
would do him—and, incidentally, the State
—the most good.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Tlie Queensland taxation department,
which would chase a flea to the Gulf to get
its fat, is giving inter-State mariners a
turn now. They reckoned that, as they
didn’t earn the exempted amount in Queens-
land, they were not liable to pay tax; but
the department doesn’t figure it out that
way, and has dropped in with claims for
years back. Further, it claims for 12 hours
after the mariner has left Brisbane going
south, and 12 hours before he has reached
Brisbane going north; and the mariner
wants to know what right it has to charge
a man who isn’t either in the State or in
territorial waters. But the department
doesn’t argue; it just lobs in its demands,
and sues if they are not satisfied. It all
adds one more to the 999 other arguments
in favor of transferring the whole business
of income-tax collection to the Federal
a uthority.
It is expected that the Riverina will have
a 45-million-bushel harvest. The indica-
tions are that it will produce more wheat
than either South Aus. or Westralia—as,
of course, it has done before. How absurd
that this great region should be governed,
as to State matters, from the out-of-the-
way port of Sydney, by politicians who know
little about its problems and aspirations and
care less! Stevens, visiting Deniliquin the
other day, was told he was the first Sydney
Premier who had been seen in that thriving
place for 25 years.
Vic. Nats, and Cockies are at cross pur-
poses again over the Mortgages Interest
Reduction Bill. Agrarians in the Assembly
were so intent on having their pet amend-
ments carried that they did not give suffi-
cient attention to the effect of the changes
°, u other parts of the measure; so the
Uppish House has to wrestle with a mass of
conflicting clauses. Draftsman O’Dowd
warned it, per Minister Jones, of the dishar-
mony. Some of the Cockies say the bill
must be carried or terrible things will
happen ; but the wisest course would be to
drop the ill-shaped thing and substitute a
simpler measure that will work.
The Federal eight-million loan should
never have been put on the market.
The Commonwealth Bank, which wanted
the public to help it nurse the large floating-
debt infant, suggested a 20-million loan ; but
it was strongly of opinion that 4 p.c. was
the minimum that could be safely offered.
Going to his first Premiers’ Conference in
Melbourne, Stevens objected to any imme-
diate loan, but scoffed at the idea of 4 p.c.—
the two great banks of Sydney would sub-
scribe a couple of millions at 34 p.c. In
view of that statement a compromise was
"Of the Federal loan of £8,000,000, the general
public subscribed only £2,986,000. The banks

reached, and 3$ p.c. was fixed afe 'the rate
of interest. The result shows that the Com-
monwealth Bank was right—the public sub-
scribed only £2.980,000. The banks will
have to take the balance.
Ihe U.A.P. gained nothing by backing
tlie Federal Labor faction in the Leichhardt
(N.S.W.) by-election. Indeed, it got a smack
in the eye in the Leg. Council, Coates’s
crowd combining with Concannon’s to defeat
the guarantor clauses of its Moratorium Bill.
And U.A.P. people in Leichhardt refused to
obey Bligh-street instructions and throw
their votes to Fed. Lab, The majority perhaps
did, but others chose the Langster as the
lesser of two evils, and five or six hundred
deliberately spoilt their ballot-papers, “re-
sulting,” as the “Labor Daily” admits, “in
the biggest informal vote ever cast in the
electorate.” Lamaro, Lang’s Attorney-
general, beat Storey, the Federal Labor man,
by 9401 to 5164. His election was a cer-
tainty ; but, with everything in his favor, he
polled only 425 votes more than the late
Barney Olde scored when his party suffered
the most disastrous defeat in its history. And
there was to have been a tremendous swing
to Langism.
“A motion for the repeal of prohibition failed
of the necessary three-fifths majority in Congress,
and another vote will not be taken till March.”
CONSTABLE HOOVER: “What’s the proposi-

country. Come back in March.”
There is room for heaps more economy in
a score of white-collar departments, but in
the R.A.N. and the A.M.F. it has been car-
ried too far. Tardily recognising this, the
Lyons Government is adding ss. lOd. a week
to the pay of adult ratings in the seagoing
service, putting petty officers and men of the
naval auxiliary branch on the same level as
corresponding ranks in the A.M.F. (they
have been drawing £l4 to £2l a year less),
and giving warrant-officers, non-coms, and
men of the military and air forces a uniform
allowance of 6d. a day. Only Communists
and pacifists will object.
Driving a car on the Albany-road, and
accelerating so as to pass a vehicle ahead
of him, a Wcstraliau bookmaker ran into a
truck, laden with picnickers, coming his
way. The driver of the truck and two of
his passengers were killed; the bookmaker
and some of his party were hurt. Tried for
manslaughter, the bookmaker pleaded that
he could have passed in safety if the man
ahead of him hadn’t accelerated at the same,
time, and that even then there would have
been no accident if his steering gear hadn’t
failed. The Crown rested its case on the
f'<cd that he was on the wrong side. A
Judge, sitting alone, would have come to a
decision between night and morning; but
two juries were unable to agree—one de-
liberated for eight hours, the other for six
hours and a half—and accused was remanded
for a third trial, at which he was found
not guilty. Shields. M.L.C., of the Speck,
has introduced a bill to abolish trial by
jury in criminal cases. That is going too
far; but trial by jury is a proved failure
in motor-car cases.
The White Star people, who bought
Hughes’s Bay liners for £1,900.000, are be-
hind with instalments, and the Seullinaries
and Langs'ters didn’t forget to remind the
Government of the fact during the late
session. Still, things might have been a
lot worse. In what the P. and O. chairman
describes as “the calamitous state of ship-
ping” a large part, of the world’s tonnage
has been laid up. The P. and O. and Orient,
which earned big profits while the Com-
monwealth Government line was making vast
losses, have ceased to pay dividends. In
1927-28, a “good” year, the expenses of the
Commonwealth Government line exceeded its
income by £593,075. If the line had been
kept going during the three depression years,
with _ precious little backloading from
Britain and a Labor Government in office
most of the time, the losses would have been
more than the ships are worth, and would
have added greatly to our difficulties.
Annual reports of two irrigation-district
canneries dealing in peaches, apricots and
pears were published last week. Sheppar-
ton (Vic.) announced net profit of £49,618,
“which, added to the balance brought for-
ward, makes £53,050 available for distri-
bution.”
The directors propose to allocate £30,000 to
reserves, making total reserves £120,000, and to pay
£BOOO to taxation reserve, leaving £15,050 for
a dividend of 10 p.c. on paid-up capital and a
bonus of 5 p.c., £3906 to be carried forward.
Extra payments to growers amounted to £17,093,
making the total paid to growers £91,013.
Leeton (N.S.W.) curtly reported a loss of
£17,200, and no taxes paid. This con-
cern is, of course, owned by the Govern-
ment, and during the year was under the
general direction of “Labor’s great leader,
Mr. J, T. Lang.”
In 1925-26 £7.343,000 was paid in war
pensions and £6,992,900 in old-age and
invalid pensions. Last year waf pensions
cost £7,440,100 and old-age and invalid pen-
sions £11,125,900. The number of war
pensioners at June 30 was 242,492 ( 75,646
were incapacitated men and 31,619 the de-
pendants of dead Diggers), and the average
fortnightly pension was 19s. 6d.; the number
of invalid and old-age pensioners was
205,609, and they averaged £1 13s 3d. a
fortnight. There were on that date 99,822
old-age and invalid pensioners in N. S.
Wales—roughly 7 p.c. of the number of
electors. Bidding for the votes of those in
Leichhardt, the Langsters promised to
restore the pension to £2 a fortnight, and
no questions asked. Their troubles about
where the money is to come from, and
whether the country goes broke trying to
find it!
The basic wage having been reduced from
£4 25.. 6d. to £3 12s. 6d., the N.S.W. State
politicians have grudgingly sacrificed a trifle
of their pay. The reductions leave them
very much better off than those in corres-
ponding positions in Victoria. Assemblymen
are on the £670 mark, whereas metropolitan
members in Victoria draw £402 and country
members £447. Premier Stevens (£1710)

Lang roars that he will be grossly underpaid.
Among the Niemeyer recommendations to
M.L. was the establishment of a Reserve
Bank, free from political control. A bill
has been introduced but will not be passed
this year. The institution will be pri-
vately-owned; it is to have a capital of
£2,500,000, in £5 shares, and £1,000,000, to
be provided by the Government, in its reserve
fund. It will take over the right of note
issue and the gold holdings that back the
present issues. On these the leading banks
aax 4A p.c. and they are perfectly

The high exchange rate doesn’t seem to
be suppressing the importer: for the first
four months of this fiscal year Australia paid
20 millions-odd for foreign fluff, etc., as
against 14 millions for the same four months
of last year. The fact is that, Australian
shelves being cleaned of goods that came in
“following on tariff changes and the removal of
various embargoes, imports for the first four months
of the year were six millions more than in the
same months of last year, while exports were only
one million more. The balance is insufficient to
pay overseas interest, which amounts to nearly
30 millions a year.”
BLONDEST LYONS: “If I come a crash you
can blame the new balancing-pole."
when rates were low, the importer now
merely adds exchange to manufacturer’s and
other charges, and business goes on as usual.
An exchange premium is a great thing so
long as you get it and don’t have to pay
it. The trouble is that the other fellow
soon wakes up; and then you are no better
off than you were before.
Tas. racing clubs are in a bad way, and
their political friends blame the craze for
betting on mainland races in pubs and shops.
The truth is that the clubs have dragged
too much from the public, and so has the
Government. “In 1923,” moans Barber,
“the T.R.C. gave £(>797 in stakes
and received £7327 in tote revenue; in
1932 the figures were £4242 and £4193.” In
other words, the tote punter has had to
furnish all the prize-money and Government
tax (£40,000 in 1923-24) to boot, in addition
to paying at the turnstiles* plus amusement
tax. No wonder people who must back
horses have drifted into the illicit dens.
Before anything else is tried the tote punter
should be given a square deal; he is over-
taxed everywhere. But, at Barber’s instance,
the House agreed to license bookmakers,
not only on racecourses, but in shops—“one
central registered premises in Hobart, Laun-
ceston and such other towns as the Commis-
sioner of Police shall approve.” It is
quack medicine, and more likely to kill than
cure.

The N.S.W. Government school-teachers
have a federation which is “non-party but
not non-political.” Pity it isn’t non-
political as well. Before the State elec-
tion “S. M. Herald” published a letter,
signed “Pedagogue,” characterising it as “an
organisation of the spurious Lang type,” and
blaming Arthur McGuinness, the president—
alleged to have been after a job on the Public
Service Board—V. C. Paddison, who wrote
a pamphlet extolling the Lang plan, and
three other gentlemen. They all issued libel
writs. The “Herald” agreed to climb down
and pay damages; “Pedagogue,” now re-
vealed as J. A. Henry, headmaster of the
Bondi commercial school, decided to fight.
McGuinness, whose case was taken first,
said he was to get £5O and costs from the
“Herald,” and the Chief Justice ruled that
this might be taken into account in assess-
ing damages. The jury fixed them at a
farthing, and as a shilling had been paid into
court plaintiff was deprived of costs. The
other cases against “Pedagogue” were
settled. He is a brother-in-law of Earle
Page.
Sydney’s lamentable City Council ran true
to form last week. The aldermen were to
have stood in silence as a gesture of sym-
pathy with the Premier in the death of his
mother; but a Labor gentleman was heard to
say, “I’d sing Hallelujah if he died.” Pre-
sently the Civic “Reformers” engaged in the
usual sordid wrangle as to who should be
Lud Mayor. As the friendly “Herald” put
it, “the Reform aldermen made their selec-
tion after having sat behind locked doors for
six hours on Thursday night and nearly
two hours on Friday morning”; and there
was the familiar uproar when the result of
these deliberations was announced. Sydney
got along fairly well without a Lud Mayor
and aldermen for two years, and would have
got along better if Bavin hadn’t drawn the
first three Commissioners from the official
class. The council should not have been
resuscitated this side of 1040.


THE SOAP-BOX
An attempt to answer some of the questions asked by correspondents.
The World’s Wool
The opinion is widely held about here
(Central N.8.W.) that the Australian wool-
grower can dictate the price of Australian
wool to the world —that he can put an a
reserve and demand it. Docs The Bulle-
tin agree with this contention? How does
it think the plan would work out? —XYZ.
The seller can demand what he likes. The
buyer decides whether he will pay or do
without. It is true that Australia provides
most of the world’s high-grade wool; but
the world could pull through with second
grade. Of the 750 million sheep in the
world Australia has less than 110 millions
and Maori land 30 millions; and of 3800
million pounds of sheep-wool produced, Aus-
tralia clips, say, 900 millions. But there
are very large quantities of goat-hair and
also the clip of alpacas, llamas, etc. Turkey
alone, for instance, has 34 million angoras.
And there is always the possibility of arti-
ficial wool-substitutes.
This “Hungry-gutted Country”
Why don’t you tell the truth about your
poor, hungry-gutted country, instead of en-
couraging Australians to live in a fool’s
paradise'? Look at the figures in any authen-
tic publication. Britain, France, New Zea-
land’ average 40 to 50 bushels wheat per
acre; A ustralia averages only 11 bushels.
And the pasture figures are just as bad —
with your one sheep to 10 acres over a large
part of the country! —Anti-Guff (Papua).
Yes, and what about labor required to
grow and harvest a bushel of that 40-bushel
crop? The writer had been visiting a farm
on the south-western slopes of N. S. Wales
from which one young man had taken off
9000 bushels of wheat with the help of one
man for nine weeks (“cropping” and har-
vesting) and a boy for about half the year.
Later in the same year he visited what was
described as one of the best farms in Somer-
set and another in Yorkshire. The Somer-
set man expected to harvest 0000 bushels;
10 men were on the job. The York-
shire figures were about the same, but
to get in the harvest of 5000 bushels 10
men would be employed for nine weeks —it
might be more. There is no country in the
world where a man single-handed can put
in so large an area or take off so large a
crop as he can in Australia. The very con-
ditions which make this possible also make
a heavy average yield per acre impossible.
Likewise the conditions which mean a small
carrying capacity in Australian sheep
country also mean almost complete freedom
from* sheep disease and the highest quality
of merino wool.
What Fixes the Value of Our £?
In various letters and articles I have
seen it mentioned that if the Australian
exchange were unpegged, overseas people
would soon inform us of the true value of
the Australian £. A correspondent in “Tlie
Other Fellow’s Mind” (B. 23/11/’32) said
that with our heavy liabilities, our impov-
erished taxpayers and our unproductive
millions in public buildings, our £ would’ be
declared to be worth much less than it
stands at to-day. How would overseas
people judge the value of our £ ? How could
they make a valuation of our assets? —
Belair (S.A.).
Though you sell goods to John Smith
it is no business of yours whether John has
borrowed ss. or £lOO,OOO so long as he pays
you cash. And that is exactly the position
between countries. They are not concerned
as cash traders with the borrowings of
another country; they are only concerned
with its flow of trade. So long as it has
gold which can be drawn upon to make good
any deficiency of exports to pay for its
imports and to meet its debt charges, other
countries are not concerned about its costs
either. Even when a country goes off gold
—that is, does not ltold itself liable to pay in
gold—other countries are not in the least con-
cerned about its borrowings or its costs so
long- as its exports are sufficient to meet all
its commitments. It is only when the balance
is against it that steps are taken to rectify
the position, and that is done not because
of costs or borrowings, but because the
foreign trader wants 20s. in the £—if there
are not enough exports to pay him, then
exchange must stimulate exports and dis-
courage imports so that he will get 20s. in
the £. The man who is selling, goods to
John Smith may say that in his opinion
John is a fool who is going to come a crash
some day ; and as a friend he might advise
John to reduce his costs or curtail his
borrowings. But as long as the bank cashed
John’s cheques he would certainly accept
them as worth 20s. in the £. The idea that
other countries would write our £ down
very severely if they had a chance merely
because of our costs and our debts is entirely
without foundation.
Export Prices and Wages
A large proportion of costs arc decided
arbitrarily and these set the standard for
costs not so controlled. The methods of
fixing wages should take the primary indus-
tries into consideration. Could not this be
done by establishing the relationship of
awards to, say, the export prices or the total
value of exports during the past 32 years?
That would shew us what the present cost-
of-living figures should be. —Esso (S.A.).
Apparently the suggestion is that cost-of-
li- ing figures (and therefore wages) should
move with the value of exports. The sugges-
tion seems to be that wages moved up more
than the rise in export prices warranted
and have moved down less than the fall
in those prices requires. The figures ought
to be well worth looking into. Taking the
official Commonwealth statistics it will be
found that between 1911 and 1924-25 the
price level of exports moved up 141 p.c.
Between 1922 and 1929 there was no year
in which the price level of exports was not
78 p.c. higher than it was in 1911. Aow,
in 1924-25 wages had risen only 86 p.c.
So whereas the primary producer had bene-
fited by a rise of 141 p.c., the wage-
earner had benefited only S 6 p.c. Thus far
things had been all to the advantage of the
primary producer. But then they changed.
This shows the movements of the two sets
of figures, 1911 being taken as the base
(= 100) in each case:
Wage Export Price
Movement. Movement.
1911 .. 100 • 100
1925 .. 186 241
1926 .. 191 185
1927 .. 194 179
1928 .. 196 192
1929 .. 197 178
There you have wlvat the economists call
the lag, wages failing to respond instantly
to a rise in prices, but persisting in moving
up long after the upward movement in
prices had ceased. Since 1929 there has
been a fall of, say, 39 p.c. in wool and 32
p.c. in wheat, while the fall in the Common-
wealth basic wage has varied from 31.3 p.c.
in S. Australia to 21.9 p.c. in Tasmania.
State basic wage awards have fallen rather
less; but are still moving down. On the
figures, therefore, the conclusions are.: (1)
The wage-earner did not share fully in the
primary producer’s tremendous prosperity;
(2) he had the best of it for the first four
years while export prices were tumbling;
(3) he has shared fairly evenly with the
primary producer in the fall since 1929.
The Intellectual Communist
Last winter a man delivered a series of
lectures under the auspices of the University
Extension Board in the town where I live.
The lecturer was a young man, an M.A.,
and had recently Icon in Europe. Home of
us who made a practice of attending the
lectures were deeply impressed hy the out-
standing ability of the lecturer. Since then
this man has more than once been in
trouble on account of his Communistic activi-
ties. Now, if Communism is the abomina-
tion that The Bulletin believes it to be, why
is such a sincere, clever man as this will-
ing to commit economic suicide and suffer
social ostracism for it? —McNoon (Vic.).
We don’t know that we have called Com-
munism an abomination. On the contrary
it might be a very good system indeed—
if human nature was very good. If every
man would do as much for the common
good and without the prospect of personal
reward as he would for himself and for
personal reward, then Communism would
have a great deal to recommend it. Now.
there are people who have a sublime faith
in human nature; and often the better they
are themselves, the better they think others
would be under another system. The lec-
turer in question was probably such a one.
His intellectual gifts don’t come into the
question at all. Neither does his honesty
or sincerity. All that is the matter is he
doesn’t know human nature. Just such a
one was William Lane, the leader of the
New Australia expedition to Paraguay—one
of the most intellectual journalists this
country ever knew and one of the most
lovable. And within six months the most
disillusioned

Exchange and the Importer
Suppose the exchange rate dropped, would
not that help the importer? And is the im-
porter a person who deserves to be helped?
—P. T. B. (Vic.).
The rate should be—must in the end
bc—governed by the flow of trade. If we
put up the rate too high, then we give too
much encouragement to exports and too
much discouragement to imports, with the
result that the money we should get for
exports is held up in London. We think
we are nowadays letting £125 in Australian
money for every £lOO worth of goods we
sell abroad. But we are not—we are only
getting it when it can be sent from London.
The individual seller no doubt gets it; but
the Commonwealth Bank has to advance it.
At present it has about 15 millions in Lon-
don which it hasn’t been able to get back
to Australia. And, anyhow, it is doubtful
whether a fall of the exchange rate would
affect the average importer, except that it
would mean lie would probably have to sell
some lines at a loss—lines which he has in
stock and which, with a lower rate, could be
imported for less. Otherwise it is not the

Purchasing Power
•To make his profit the factory owner must
price his goods at a higher amount than they
cost him to make and market. Thus the
workers in a, factory arc not given enough
purchasing power (wages) to buy back the
goods which they have produced. And the
same is true of every other factory in the
Zand. Thus the people of any one country
cannot buy back all the goods produced,
Under capitalism there must always be
under-consumption. For the life of me I
can't see any flaw in this argument. —Gos-
hawk (Q.).
Well, where are all the goods that have
been produced and haven’t been able to find
a sale through all the ages? Or for the last
100 years? They must have gone on aecu-
mulating. Where arc they? Smith has a
shirt-factory and turns out £.lOOO worth of
goods (retail price). He has paid his
workers £300; £3OO has gone for material,
£lOO for rent, power, etc.; £3OO is left for
marketing and profit. It is said that some ot
that stock must be left over because the
manufacturer hasn’t paid out more than £<oo.
But where did he get the £700? The shirts
haven’t been sold yet—not one of them.
Obviously it must be on some previous trans-
actions that he depends. And that is the
whole strength of it. The £lOOO worth of stuff
cail be made and sold because of previous
transactions, which enable the maker to
pay his workpeople, and for material and
all the rest of it. And the retailer can buy
because either he or somebody else who
finances him has the unconsumed proceeds
of previous transactions—he can buy before
he sells. A dozen men are dropped on an
island and start bartering their products
and services. One, who lias some seeds, pre-
gently gets a phenomenal crop. He can
barter it for far more than he needs at once;
so > realising that some otliqr time the ciop

The Gold Basis
We can get 345 . a i most anywhere in Aus-
traiia f or a sovere ign; that is to say, 100
sovereigns are worth £l7O Australian . But
we p r { m ary producers are getting only £125
Australian for our wool and wheat. Where
js the difference going? It seems to me we
nre joeing rooked. — Near-bankrupt Grazier
(yic )
o ur'currency is tied to stilling. In Sep-
tember last, before England ceased to pay
in gold, £l3O Australian was worth 100
sovereigns. The fact that England went
off gold should not have made any difference
to our £; as a matter of fact, our £ had
been steadily improving in real value as our
trade balance improved. Actually, however,
the slip of sterling produced an equal slip
of our £ on top of the slip which had
already occurred, so that, instead of our £l3O
purchasing 100 sovereigns, it at once re-
quired £l7O or more to buy gold equivalent
to 100 sovereigns. A French manufacturer
has 10,000 francs to spend on wool. But
instead of being able to buy with it £BOO
sterling in London he can now buy £lllO
sterling. And with his £lllO sterling he
can get £l3BO Australian. Whether the
Frenchman bids so much more by reason
of the high value of his money compared
with ours is another matter.

. “Bow Street” : Sydney policemen are occa-
sionally assigned quaint rdles; some of them
have been required recently to dress and
play the part of wealthy young men of
fashion for the effectual trapping of sly-grog
sellers and s.p. bettors. And policewomen,
it seems, may be called on at any moment
for masquerading, too. A trap was set the
other day in Moore Park for some suspected
robbers. Several hefty constables were got
up to resemble down-and-outs; “two more
strolled into the park with women police
on their arms, and, while pretending to be
lovers, kept an eye out for the suspects.”
The ruse was apparently successful, but the
usually ubiquitous press photographers
missed a chance of getting something extra-
special in the way of snaps. One confesses
a curiosity as to how John Hop and a Jenny
Hop would comport themselves to impress
park loafers with the delusion that they
were in the Romeo and Juliet business. At
the present rate, there should soon be
material in the Sydney force for a better
theatrical show than the average amateur
company furnishes.

“Razorback”: “Nakh” isn’t quite accu-
rate about Knox D’Arcy, who in later years
spent most of his Queensland-acquired mil-
lions in establishing the Persian Oil Co. (B.
7/32/’32). D’Arcy had niiything but a
“small practice” at Rockhampton; it was
a very extensive one, his clients including
most of the wealthy squatters of the West.
The lawyer certainly floated a company for
the man who discovered the Mount, but he
did it in conjunction with Walter Hall, a
“Rocky” bank manager. The Morgan brothers
got little out of their find compared with
the original shareholders. In addition to
D’Arcy and Hall, several' other Rockhamp-
ton citizens came in. One was Billy Pat-
terson, later a politician, who made as much
out of the mine as D’Arcy or Hall, but died
broke.

“Bootless Inlet”: Some of the tourist
agencies have been raising a howl because
the London Mission at Port Moresby
refused to permit its dusky flock to give a
native dance on a
Sunday for the Car-
intliia trippers. It
will do no harm if
such public exhibitions
are stopped altogether.
The visits of gaping
globetrotters have had
a lot to do with the
deterioration of the
native inhabitants.
The cinema fiends
who invade the coun-
try in search of local
color have done little
less harm. There is
no vainer dweller on
the earth than a
young Papuan buck,
and the fatuous
admiration of igno-
rant white strangers
of both sexes which
has been bestowed on
him and his fellows
since the country was
Rediscovered as an
“attract ion” has
swelled his head to
bursting-point.

“Cock Over”: For
over a century it has
been the custom of
Irish viceroys to send
the King a pie con-
taining 24 woodcocks,
birds highly rated by
epicui’es and much
more plentiful in Ire-
land tlian iix any part
of England except the
West. The new Sinn
Fein Governor-Gexxeral
has announced that
there will be no pie
proffered by him to King George. Still,
matters might be worse. Austi’alia is pre-
senting its .sovereign with a frozen lamb.

“C.Q.”; Melbourne taximen are not as
dull-witted as “Whitehall’s” drivers (B.
7/12/’32). An empty hearse was causing
a jamb by manoeuvring at the world’s
intersection. “Whadja doing,
Digger?” yelled a passing cabby. “Cruising
for custom ?”

“Strep.”; As “Pawang” conjectures (B.
7/12/’32), the reason for Melbourne Uni.
making its show of disease cultures a
strictly private one was the fear that
some crank would steal one of the
cultures and empty it into the city
water supply. It recalls H. G. Wells’s story
of “The Stolen Bacillus.” An anarchist
calls on a famous bacteriologist with forged
letters of introduction. The sage—a bit of
a flaneur, like many of his kind—made much
of one tube containing a reputed cholera
culture. After bowing his visitor out, he
finds that the tube he has discoursed upon
lias been abstracted. In the chase that fol-
lows the tube is broken, and the anarchist
swallows the few drops of culture remain-
ing in the hope that the infection will come
about through his death., To his surprise he
is allowed to go. As the professor explains,
the stolen tube merely contained the bacilli
which cause the blue patches on the hind-
quarters of certain monkeys,

“Barbarossa” : It is difficult to say why
the King should be desirous of seeing the
moustache return among the officers of his
regiments (B. 7/12/’32). Tradition features
the soldier as more or less hirsute for cen-
turies before Shakspeare wrote of him “as
bearded like the pard.” The fashion went
out with the seventeenth century, and stayed
out until the middle of the nineteenth, as
far as the British Army was concerned,
Wellington’s fighters were smooth-faced,
contrasting strongly in this regard with
Napoleon’s, as Conan Doyle and other
writers have pointed out. Military fashions
in the matter of face-decoration seem en-
tirely arbitrary and rather pointless. With
other professions there was generally some
reason given for a mode, even if it was not
entirely convincing. The English Bar was
clean-shaven for generations, the idea being
that an advocate could enunciate more dis-
tinctly without a lip-thatch. There were
cases in early-Victorian days of Judges re-
fusing to hear moustached pleadex-s, just as
a Judge nowadays might decline to hear one
wearing a pepper-and-salt coat. But that
convention disappeared, I think, about the
seventies of last century. Anyhow, the
barrister with whom I read law in the
Temple wore the luxuriant moustaches one
used to associate with cavalry officers, and
the Bar didn’t take to the razor again whole-
heartedly until the public gave it a lead.
GEOMETRICAL.
“I don’t know why Mavis is always hanging round that crowd—she hasn’t a hope
of breaking into any of their circles?”
“No, dear, but she’s the sort of girl that might break into one of their triangles.”
“Norbell” : Let me add my tribute to the
kindly trait which occasionally impels medi-
cal men to forego their fees. When touring
with a little E-flat dramatic company in
Queensland, I was taken ill at Many Peaks.
The local sawbones, hurriedly summoned, in-
jected morphia to soothe my anguish and sat
with me for an hour or more. When he was
leaving I quite expected the hard word, and
hinted as much, but he smiled gently and
said, “I never charge for my services to
a member of the theatrical profession.” I
felt profoundly grateful, but I have since
suspected that he knew Scalem, our mana-
ger, as well as I did. Scalem never paid
anyone in any circumstances unless threat-
ened with personal violence—and not always
then.

“Karchai-ias” : The head of the Surf Life-
saving Association is aggrieved at the publi-
city given to the “so-called shark menace.”
According to him it is altogether overdone;
“over the last 18 years we have
not had an average of one shai’k
attack per annum”; “if sharks
were as plentiful and as savage
as some would have us think,
shark attacks would be of daily
occurrence” ; “visitors get the im-
pression that surfing on our
beaches is dangerous, whereas it
is the least dangerous of any
sport.” Still, when a peril is
admitted to exist, howsoever re-
mote it may be, it would be fool-
ish and worse to seek to minimise
and gloze it over by such euphem-
istic methods as calling “shark-
proof baths” “safety-bathing en-
closures”—one of the devices sug-
gested. Much better to study the
shark more closely and devise
further preventive methods against
him. His savagery is probably
exaggerated; according to Bullen
it is the voracity caused by an ever-
gnawing liver that is responsible
for his bloodthirstiness. In any
case, what do a few undeserved
aspersions on our beaches matter
in comparison with human lives?
“C.Q.”: The rent war, like the Great
War, has its humorous side. A Melbourne
business man whose affairs have gone to
pot received the umpteenth request from the
agent for something on account of arrears.
“To save being bothered by you any more,”
he replied, “I am moving into a cheaper
house!”

“Mells”: The man who plays cricket, or
any other, game, temporarily waives his
right as a citizen to ask the law to award him
reparation for any injuries sustained in the
course of that game (B. 7/12/’32). Other-
wise there could never have been a prize
ring—or, rather modern boxing contests.
When prize-fighting was illegal, a pugilist
who had the misfortune to kill his opponent
might be (and sometimes was) tried for
manslaughter. Still, even in that case, I
doubt if there is any instance of one hav-
ing been sued for damages; it was the
criminal law, aggrieved at being ignored,
that stepped in. not the civil law that was
invoked. In games that are perfectly lawful
there can be no question of either. Hence
I doubt if there can be any interest for
lawyers iix whether a bowler aims at the
wickets with the intention of hittiixg them
or at the padded and gloved batsman
with the effect or rattling or scaring him.
It’s all within the rules.

“D.D.”: I’ve read that verse by Parkes
about “My Ragged Jane” (B. 30/11/’32),
but there’s one I shall remember much longer
—the verse he flung at Hyem at Balmain
one night in 1886. Parkes went to Balmain
to help the cause of Freetrade and smash
Hyem, the Protectionist candidate. After call-
ing that very decent chap a crawling cur
and a poodle-headed thing, lie said that the
candidate had come back asking to be re-
turned to the seat he had fouled and dis-
honored, but would find himself in the same
condition as the commercial w T ho left his
nightshirt behind at a hotel and sent a note
to the chambermaid asking her to forward
the garment on to him. To that note the
maid replied :—■
“Hi ’ope, dear sir, you won’t be tiffed
When now Hi tell you hall habout hit;
Hof your hold shirt Hi’ve made a shift,
Hand you must now make shift with-hout hit.”
Still, Parkes did occasionally get beyond the
puerile; a poem of his on the burial of
Wentworth has found its way into a collec-
tion of verse by Australian poets.

“Bill O’C.”: Samuel Beddome, who for
uncounted years presided over the Adelaide
Police Court, was an example of how suc-
cessful a police magistrate can be without
legal training (B. 30/11/’32). From day
to day, year in and year out, he listened
to the arguments of a couple of generations
of lawyers and defendants in person, never
argued with them, and delivered his findings
in one or two words —“question allowed,”
“dismissed,” or “fined five pounds,” as the
case required. He amounted to a local
institution and lots of his old court recidi-
vistcs came to regard his kindly-looking old
white beard as the symbol of the common-
sense friend who at least put a temporary
end to their troubles and did it without
needless reproaches. Adelaide has had
several very capable lawyer successors to
the old man’s seat, including liis own son-
in-law, the late James Gordon, but none
of them was sounder than he in judgment
upon facts and none quite as terse in deliv-
ering it. Judgment without reasons was
his abiding rule, which probably saved many
an appeal. “But the learned magistrate
might have thought tlxus-and-thus” was an
appellant Judge’s hurdle hard to get over.
No one ever knew what the wise old beak
thought, except in so far as his finding
implied it.

“Pontifex”: Sixteen persons have hurled
themselves off Sydney’s Harbor Bridge since
it was opened. Only two survived. This
makes a suicide, or attempted suicide, from
the Bridge almost a fortnightly occurrence,
without taking into consideration several
people who have been arrested and placed
in safe keeping because their actions sug-
gested that they were contemplating self-
destruction. If the Bridge could not be made
suicide-proof, it could certainly be made a
great deal safer than it is for an expendi-
ture which would represent the merest frac-
tion of its original cost. Yet the latest
newspaper outcry was not about the inade-
quacy of the railings but the unsightliness
of the new toll-house!

“Jeviel: The latest air accident, in which
Flying-Olficer Blarney was killed in a D.II.
Moth, his mechanic escaping almost unhurt,
once more stresses how dangerous is the
front cockpit of a two-seater. When a D.PI.
Moth, for instance, hits the ground nose-
down at high speed, 2801 b. of metal is
wrenched from the engine bearers and
rammed back into the forward cockpit. This
cockpit cannot be moved aft, as it must be
at the centre of gravity; but a shock-
absorbing structure built into the fuselage
behind the engine would at least make it
safer. The forward section of the fuselage
could be specially reinforced to take some
of the strain. The death of a highly-trained
Air Force pilot is always deplorable : some-
thing should be done to minimise the risk
he runs.
CHRISTMASTIDE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Slam down the shutters on dull care!
Toss ledgers with their profit small
Aside! There’s laughter in the air:
Old Christmas gives his cheery call.
And, all its troubles put away,
The world is set for holiday.
What matters if the year was hard,
With little gold in its alloy?
One asset has remained unmarred ;
Christmas is still a time for joy,
When, jazzed-capped in the merry throng,
We quaff the wine of mirth and song.
Empty the till of all its hoard,
With cautious warnings laughter-stilled!
The lordly goose must grace the board ;
The cup of revelry be filled ;
And gifts must pass with careless hand,
When Merry Christmas takes command.
Hey! for a season free from care,
With laughter heard o’er bush and beach,
And kindly feeling in the air.
After embattled days we reach
A haven screened from Fortune’s slings;
The Armistice that Christmas brings!

“Verri”: In one of the most famous two-
up raids in Maoriland the police, although
they lay in wait in a camouflaged dug-out,
had no need to chase the players at the end
of their vigil. For over two hours they had
had two excellent cameras focussed on the
game; not a player or an onlooker escaped
photographic record, and underneath the
pictures names, addresses and other infor-
mation were all neatly tabbed. The click of
the cameras passed unnoticed amid the
“Heads” and “Tails.” The usual stampede
MORE DIRECT ACTION.
"Why do you put all them fings in boilin’ water, Mum?
“Weil, daddy’s ill, you see, and the germs inject these things. By putting them in
boiling water I kill the germs. Do you understand?”

took place when the police emerged, but the
fleeing victims were urged not to hurry
“We’ve got snaps of you all!”

“X.S.”: A man who was charged with
being drunk and resisting the police told
a Fitzroy (Vic.) beak that he had been
imbibing Hill GO. “It’s a Fitzroy wine,
y’ Honor,” said the sergeant, “an’ guaran-
teed to make a man fight anything !”
“Adelaide”: Life has been one bitterness
after another for an Adelaide youth. A
year ago he was before the Courts for per-
sistent attempts to take his life, his girl-wire
being dead. Having found another girl, he
met her on the Torrens lake m other com-
nanv and ordered her into his boat.' JNext
he threatened to push her into the river was
(of course) “dared” to do it, and with a
reckless shove did it. The poor joke turned
to tragedy; the girl was drowned and so
was a boy who tried to save her. A Judge
said it was all very sad, but he would have
to make it three years. And the widower-
homicide-eonvict is only 21!

“Lord Luvus”: A shocking blasphemy on
the cult of nudism i.s reported from Paris.
A * young couple, fully dressed, visited a
colony and brazenly kissed. The nudists
remonstrated with
them over this un-
savory display of sexu-
ality, but they only
roared with laughter :
so Lucien Trontigny.
a famous nudist boxer,
showed the youth the
error of his ways by-
knocking him down,
being mulcted £lO in
damages subsequently.
The osculating pair
offended against one
of the most sacred
dogmas of the cult,
the notion that there
is nothing so chaste
as the naked body:
but the ordinary indi-
vidual will conclude
that if nudists can't
survey two people
kissing without being
moved to homicidal
frenzy they must be in
a frightful state of
repression. Nudism,
as a matter of fact,
is only inverted Puri-
tanism, and the aver-
age nudist is only an
exhibitionist who gains
courage from num-
bers. One doesn't
hear of artists or
physiologists ac cu s-
tomed to view the
human body objective-
]y taking their clothes off and walking about
the woods with a lot of self-conscious
acquaintances similarly disrobed as a son
of religious ritual. #
“W.E.F.”: “Deekay’s” par. about the
movie patron who mistook Signor Grandi
for Gandhi (B. 7/12/'32) reminds me of
the first time my seven-year-old daughter
saw the Indian trouble-maker in a news-
reel. The little old man. displaying his
famous grin and wearing a white robe, was
being welcomed by a London crowd, when
she cut in with “Look, Dad, there’s Billy
Hughes in his mummy's nightie!’’ She had
been poring over David Low’s “Billy Book. ’

“Lao-dah” : The breaking-down of the ban
on the 70,000.000 untouchables of India is
proceeding at such a rate
as to amount to a social
revolution. Schools, wells
and courts previously for-
bidden to the no-castes
are being opened indis-
criminately, and the
rulers of four native
States, including Kash-
mir and Baroda, have
pledged themselves to
support the movement.
It required a civil war
and 500,000 casualties to
emancipate the American
negro, and the action of
an absolute monarch to
achieve freedom for the
serfs of Russia. A soli-
tary, thin individual, of
no official standing,
appears to he doing' the
same thing in India by
merely going off his
tucker, which was not very extensive at the
best of times.

“Gumleaf” : These broadcasting enterprises
certainly infuse variety into their pro-
grammes : the latest novelty projected is “the
complete happenings of . a huge aboriginal
corroboree taking place at Barambah on
December 17.” Hard by is a settlement,
maintained by the Queensland Government,
where there are a thousand or so of Black (or
more or less so) Brother, and 2UW Sydney
is co-operating with 4BC Brisbane, by grace
of the Protector of Aborigines, to provide the
entertainment. The dances, of course, can
only be described, but native songs, Christ-
mas carols by an abo. children's choir and
the music of an abo. brass band will be
among the attractions, not to mention
numbers by “some of the more talented” in-
habitants of the settlement.

“Icarus”: Civil aviation progresses stead-
ily in Australia, if not as rapidly as in
some parts of the world. During the year
to June .30 flights made covered three million
miles, paying passengers totalled 67,280, over
200 tons of freight were carried and 35,0001 b.
of mails. Licensed pilots (commercial and
private) numbered 564: there were 204
registered aircraft, 97 public aerodromes, and
COMPENSATIONS.
“I don’t care for Peggy—she’s so small-minded.”
“But awfully generous—she’ll give anybody a piece of it."
IS4 Government aerodromes and emergency
landing-grounds. In New Guinea gold-
mining activities have made the, figures even
more striking in one respect, for though the
mileage was nothing out of the way, the
freight totted up to nearly 3000 tons. And
there are other things than can hardly, be
computed in dry figures, such as the benefits
to the isolated Nor’-West and North of
Westralia and the dwellers along the route
of Q.A.N.T.A.S. Taking it by and largo,
the Government, is getting a good return
from its expenditure on air services, with
a reservation in the case of the costly
subsidy with which Bruce and Page saddled
it for' that section of Westralian Airways
which competes with the East-West rail-
way. , .

“,C. Caf.’L: London cabled round the world
the intelligence that, an English mother had
given it the distinction of being the birth-
place of the baby. The
morsel weighed lib. Boz. Yallourn, Vic-
toria’s brown-coal township, was the birth-
place of an even smaller baby the other day.
Perfectly proportioned it weighed lib. 7oz. at
birth, but rapidly put on flesh. Then it
succumbed to some infantile malady.
“0.Q.”: The move to protect individuals
against the claims of financial institutions
which began in the Malice has spread
in a new form to Melbourne. At East Mal-
vern the other day there was a forced sale
of the property of ratepayers who had refused
to pay a special rate struck by the Glen
Waverley Railway Construction Trust. The
sale took place at the Murrumbcena police
station, and 300 people turned up. A wire-
less broadcasting van was run into the yard
next door, and a stentorian voice kept' in-
forming all and sundry that “The East Mal-
vel'n Ratepayers’ Association has made
arrangements to purchase the goods, on. be-
half of the owners therefore outsiders will
you please refrain from bidding?” The
result whs' that a butcher’s marble table,
an organ,, a •,sideboard and an extension table
went for a shilling apiece, and a piano for
half a crown. The highest offer was' 13s.
for a marble slab, but that came from a
young man who desisted when he was
threatened with physical violence. At the
conclusion of the sale, which brought in less
than 30 shillings .on account of rates 20
times that figure, three cheers were given
for the police, hoots for the Trust, the sal-
vaged goods were put in vans and, followed
by a long procession of cars filled with vil-
lage Hampdens, were returned to their
owners. .. ~

“L. de R.” : Film comedies are often
funnier behind the screen than in front of
it. .1 Avas watching the shooting of a talkie
in Melbourne the other day. An ex-legit,
actor, Avho has been out of a job for years,
had a small part as a millionaire with a
beautiful and extravagant daughter who had
run up a little bill as a result of a trip to
Europe. The director gave the millionaire
his cue. The plutocrat quickly dowsed the
cigarette he was smoking on his boot and put
the butt in his pocket for future reference.
Then he stepped into the range of the
camera, sat down at a table and signed a
cheque for 50,000 dollars.
“Gasper”: A controversy still rages in
England over the origin of the cigarette in
Europe. One journal dates it to a French
soldier, back from Napoleon’s invasion of
Egypt. But Casanova says in his memoirs
that he had seen cigarettes smoked in
Spain in 1767. Beyond doubt this method
of smoking was introduced from South
America by returned Spanish adventurers of
the Cortes-Pizarro days. Prescott states
that the invading Spaniards found the in-
habitants smoking tobacco rolled in maize
leaf, as their half-breed descendants do to-
day. Nicholas Coundouris, finding that the
English had acquired a taste for the paper
cylinders in the Crimean War, introduced
them to London in 1858. One of his early
customers was the 17-year-old Prince of
Wales, later Edward VII.
“Medik”: What transparent hypocrisy
Gandhi is guilty of when he talks of “risking
his life” in his fasts ! A prisoner who has
been deprived of lethal weapons can end his
life in three ways, provided he means busi-
ness. By holding his breath, or otherwise
checking respiration, he could pass aloft in
a matter of minutes. If he didn’t drink he
would go to his 'reward in two or three
days. But a man may live without eating
for weeks, and if he takes wafer periodically,
as Gandhi does, he is likely to be fairly tit
at the end of a month. Gandhi’s invariable,
procedure has been to tell the world that
lie has made up his mind to starve to death
as a protest against something or other;
then to fix a date for the commencement of
the tragedy; then to go on a water diet; and
then to announce that, honor being satis-
fied, the fast is over. One could respect
the British suffragettes and some of the
Irish political prisoners; if they hadn’t been
forcibly fed they would have died for their
principles in droves. Gandhi obviously has
no intention of dying for his principles; he
merely exploits them for publicity purposes.
“Exile” : Perhaps a Victorian Digger who
has lived in England since the war may
be permitted a word about the Australian
accent (B. 1.4/!)/’32). When I first came
to. England during the war. I found little
difference between the Englishmen’s accent
and that of my cobbers and, I suppose, my
own. But the difference between the accent
of the Australian and English nurses was
most marked. Several , Australian friends
have visited me here with their wives, and
while the men’s accent seems perfectly
normal to me, the women’s is noticeably
different.

“0.W.W.”: Possibly one reason why sky*
pilots fight a little shy of barbers’ shops (B.
!)/11/’32 is that, where betting is illegal,
the local barber is only too often the local
bookie as yvell. This is the case in Maori-
land, where, the story is still told of a newly-
ordained minister who entered a hair-
dresser’s in a Hawkes Bay town. Plainly
it was his first call, for he seemed nervous
and tried to keep the conversation to poli-
tics while he was being operated on. Then
the barber, with an eye on a pot of hair oil
and a water sprinkler, asked: “What would
you like to have ; on. sir?” The parson
pursed his lips. ' “Nothing,” lie replied
coldly; “I abhor gambling.”

“Avon”: Maorilaiul hasn’t enjoyed “re-
vival meetings” for donkey’s years.—Torrey
and'Alexander gave the islanders their last
really memorable taste of that sort of thing
—but they have now in their midst an
evangelist named Jones beside whom all the
hot-gospellers of the past fade into insig-
nificance. This Mr. Jones has what is
described as the “healing touch.” Here are
a few extracts from flic scene at one of
Jones’s Wellington meetings when lie
applied the “touch” to people who assembled
on the platform, as described by that very
staid and truth-respecting journal the
“Dominion” :
Two assistants joined the evangelist, who began a
round of the group. As Mr. Jones placed one hand
on the shoulder and the other a few inches above
the forehead of man or woman, one assistant waited
behind to catch the falling form. The other assistant
prayed and chanted religious names until the touch
had its effect, and the person collapsed. Some
swayed gently backward and forward until they
overbalanced and were laid on the floor. Others
went down as though they had been sandbagged.
As person after person succumbed to the influence
at work the front of the hall presented a remarkable
spectacle. One woman lay drumming her heels on
the floor. An. elderly man was stretched flat on . his
back with hands upraised and fists clenched while
he shouted snatches of praise. The heavy breathing
of the prostrate people sounded like the hiss of
escaping steam. A man wept aloud. At the climax
of the scene it was as if a machine-gun had swept
the hall from side to side. So many were prostrated
in the comparatively small space that some had to
be pulled aside to make room for others as they
dropped.
A GOLDEN HAIR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“On one occasion I noticed a long golden hair
clinging to the lapel of his coat and powder all
over his sleeve.” —Petitioner in divorce case.
How it recalls the just-affianced stripling
Who sought ingeniously to imply
The powder was cigar ash; blamed on
tippling . , .
The love-light clubmen assayed in his eye.
And for the golden hair found {vide Kipling)
An explanation in his slobbering Skye.!
Nor have they altered, it would seem, since
then,
The ways of men with maids —or maids with
men.
I wonder if, when Noah went navigating,
Shem’s wife, or Ham’s, or .7aphot s,
scanned her lord
At times for evidence incriminating
And telltale traces that would point
toward
Slightly too intimate associating
Or dalliance with some other dame aboard.
Powder perhaps was none to leave a mark,
But there’d be paint by slathers in the Ark.
I wonder whether lovers most symphonious
Aren’t by occasional suspicions rent;
If Cleopatra never asked Antonius.
What some stray hairpin on his toga
meant,
Or waxed imperiously acrimonious
Over a fancied sniff of alien scent.
For gay Lotharios and tertiurh quids.
Be sure, are older than the Pyramids.
I wonder if the ancient warrior Briton
Returned from bloody battles, blue in
woad,
To find his missus ready with the mitten
If any clue upon his warpaint showed
That not alone by spears he had been smitten
But eke by arrows (Cupid’s) on the road ;
And if the sex possessed as keen a sense
As- now for circumstantial evidence.
What matter though the grey old world
grows older, / <
Still Beauty draws us with a single hair.
But when she kinder grows or you grow
bolder
(Or both mayhap), philanderer, beware
Lest, as she lays her head upon your
shoulder,
She doesn’t leave that same exhibit there.
And, if it’s reddish-gold, my son, look out!
You’ll get. no benefit of any doubt.

Joe Carruthers, who died at the week-end,
was the last of the 10 who represented N. S.
Wales in the convention which drafted our
Federal Constitution. H'ow high Carruthers
stood in the public life of Australia at that
day (the election took place on March 14,
1897) may be judged by the fact that only
Barton and Reid led him in the poll; the
seven who came after him were McMillan,
Lyne, Brunker, R. E. O’Connor, Abbott,
Walker and Wise. Like most of the other
N.S.W. members Carruthers never figured
afterwards in Federal politics. But from Feb.,
1887, until the time of his death he was never
out of State politics. He was in the Assembly
21 years and in the Council for 24.
One of Carruthers’s oldest living colleagues
is James Ashton, whose own Parliamentary
career began in 1894, and who was Car-
ruthers’s Minister for Lands from 1904 to
1907. Of his old leader Ashton says: “I have
known no man who was his equal, when in the
heyday of his career, in piloting a complicated
measure through the House.” Carruthers’s
legal training helped him, no doubt; he was
admitted as a solicitor 53 years ago. Yet,
curiously, he never was much interested in
law reform; first the land laws and then
education were his great subjects. Old hands
will argue whether his deafness was a help
or a hindrance; there is no doubt that he
made very good use of it at times.
“D.”: The late Joe Carruthers was a
queer bundle of contradictions. He came of
unco’ _ guid Methodist stock, yet he was re-
sponsible for the starting of more race-
courses than any man of his day. H’e was
small and often ill, yet he played cricket
for Sydney ’Varsity, and he could out-work
any dozen ordinary politicians while he was
in public life. He was deaf, yet a most
amusing companion; and he was a born
raconteur, though his speeches in Parlia-
ment and from the hustings were dull and
platitudinous. He called himself a Liberal
and thought he was a radical, but he was
actually a complete Tory, who hated change
of any kind. His distrust of change was the
explanation of his opposition to Upper
House reform. It also explained his iron-

clad Cobdenism, of which the wire-netting
business was only one manifestation. The
glorification of Cook, to which he devoted
so many of the closing years of his life, was
one of his ways of glorifying Sydney. He
was a true Sydneyite, a typical Geebung, one
of the very few moderns who would have
been quite at home in the Cabbage Tree mob;
yet he was also a countryman and a lover
of the land. Some of his happiest days were
spent on his farms. An example of heredity.
His father was a Glasgow immigrant who
became a successful South Coast farmer.
After a struggle among half a dozen
Civic Reform aldermen which recalled the
rush for the spoils among a Parliamentary
Labor Caucus. R. C. Hagon secured the
nomination which put him, a few hours
later, into Sydney’s mayoral chair. Hagon
is the Nestor of the City Council. He was
born at Hobart 77 years ago, and came to
Sydney when he was 20. Tailoring is his
craft, and the widening of city streets his
pet municipal hobby.
There was plenty of variety in the early
life of William Elliot Johnson, ex-Speaker
of the House of Reps., who died last week.
Born at Newcastle (Eng.) 70 years ago, he
started to earn his living as a London tele-
graph boy, and presently exchanged that
calling for that of a scenic artist, his father’s
trade. Then he heard the call of the sea,
and became an_ apprentice, serving in sail
and steam and
Sticking to it
until he ob-
tained his
secon d-mate’s
certificate. Back
to scene-paint-
ing, he came to
Sydney at 21;
another 20 years
were to elapse
before politics
claimed him.
Johnson was
elected for the
Lang division
as a Freetrader
at the second
Federal elec-
tions, becoming

Speaker.
secretary and Whip of the party that fol-
lowed George Beid. In 1913-14 he was
Speaker under the precarious Cook Adminis-
tration, and occupied the chair again, more
securely, in the consulship of Hughes, from
1917 to 1923. In 192 S he lost his seat, and
the House knew him no more.
Dr. J. Storie Dixson, who passed over in
Sydney last week had much in common
with the late Charles Clubbe; the
hospitals and charitable institutions found
in each a tireless and unselfish helper. Dr.
Dixson was a stay and prop to several of
the best-known and most deserving of these.
Nor did that exhaust his energies; he was at
one time a lecturer at Sydney Uni., and
his scientific interests extended to museums
and natural-history societies. He became
president of the N.S.W. Medical Board in
1919.
Colonel William Charley, who for years
managed Belmont Park (N.S.W.) for his
brother Philip, went to Leeton after the
war and took up Merigrove: he died there
last week, aged 67. Philip, the big brother
of the family, was the late George McCul-
loch’s handy boy (George hated getting out
to open gates) when Broken Hill was found;
and he got a sixteenth. He put some of it
into Belmont Park, near Bichmond, and had
his young brother Bill trained at Bose-
worthy (S.A.). Philip Charley must be
about the last left of that first Mt. Gipps
syndicate. It was William Charley who
invented the Kangaroo rifle-plate, to gauge
the angle for night-firing.
In a burst of candor Lieut.-Gov. William
Irvine told a gathering of Scots in Melbourne
a few days ago that he had been well paid
for his public services. Irvine has drawn
slightly more than £60,000 since he entered
public life in September, 1894. At retire-
ment he will be entitled, as an ex-C.J., to a
pension of £l5OO a year.
A nephew of Cardinal Newman died at
Invercargill the other day, aged 79. His
career in M.L. was a varied one, but mostly
he followed clerical callings. An elder
brother, who died in the Cold Country last
year, was a bank manager.
The F.C.T. has lost a lovable old medico
in Patrick Blackall. A Dublin man, he
settled at Queanbeyan in 1892, and found
time in the intervals of an extensive prac-
tice —his beat extended from Brindabella to
Captain’s Flat—to acquire Killard station.
The estate was subdivided a few years ago,
but the doctor retained the homestead as
his residence. He was several times Mayor
of Queanbeyan, and once narrowly missed
becoming its M.L.A. Since January he had
lived at Canberra, where his eldest daughter,
Dr. Moya Blackall, is in practice.
William Patrick Kelly, who died in har-
ness at Wellington (N.S.W.) —he was en-
gaged in a court ease when seized by a heart
attack—was a well-known country solicitor.
He was also a keen Labor politician; he was
among the batch of new members appointed
to the Leg. Council to swell the Lang forces
seven years ago. Befusing to be a puppet,
he was expelled by the A.L.P. heads after
Lang’s first attempt to abolish the Leg.
Council failed.
C. F. Plant, who died in Brisbane the
other day at 89, came to Queensland with
his brother, E. H. T., from Nottingham. The
pair were early at Charters Towers, and
there were not many of the big propositions
there in which they had not an interest.
As in the case of many other good Towers
citizens they put much of the money won
from the field back into it again, some of it
for ever. “C.F.” was a keen volunteer, and
for years was in command of the Kennedy
regiment, which had its H.Q. on the gold-
field in the days of the State military forces.
Jelley, M.L.C., is again talking of retiring
at the end of his present term. Jelley, a
cabinet-maker by trade, arrived in the S.
Aus. Parliament in 1912, and has sat con-
tinuously for the Central District and for
Central District No. 1. He was Chief Sec-
retary from 1924 to 1927, and has been
Acting Treasurer during the recent absence
of the much-harried Premier Hill. He is
still on the right side of 60.
Commander B. C. Garsia, who has been
appointed Administrator of Nauru, was with
the naval section of the troops operating
in German New Guinea, and was aboard the
Sydney when she shot the Emden to pieces.
After that he was with the second British
Naval Squadron in the North Sea, and
after his return to Australia took over com-
mand of H.M.A.S. Melbourne in 1921. For
some time past he has been in command of
reserve ships at Garden Island.
The shortest-lived Ministry in Australian
history was one which George Fuller formed
just before Christmas, 1921, when trouble
occurred in the Labor Cabinet which Jim
Dooley led after John Storey’s death. It
came in and went out on the same day; and
just-dead Joe Carruthers, who was its repre-
sentative in the Leg. Council, never had a
chance to say what great things it would do
if it were allowed. That Storey-Dooley Gov-
ernment, by the way, was the one in which
J. T. Lang first figured as Treasurer.
MARCHESE FERRANTE, the new Italian
Consul-General.
“S.T.S.”: The best service the late Fred
Johns did to journalism was the blow he
dealt to the bad old collections of “Notables,”
where every subscriber of a big sum could
write his own biography. Johns, a genial
autocrat, included only such people as he
thought worthy, and, after getting the facts
from them, only such details as he thought fit.
A fine lot of journalists were trained on Adel-
aide “Eegister” by Finlayson and Sowden,
Burns and Fbster became its editors;
Moxon Cook. Hadrian Moody and Matthews
went to Melbourne; Johns and Cockburn to
“Hansard” work; Clarence Moody to the
“Mail” and then to Sydney; David Gordon
into politics ; Cutlack and Foster to London ;
and “Bufus” Whitington has been absorbed
by the “Advertiser.”
John Gilbert McLaren, who succeeds
James Collins as London Secretary, was born
at Parramatta 61 years ago and educated
at Sydney High School and Sydney Uni
He put in 12 years of his early manhodd
as a clerk in the Government Savings Bank
and when the Commonwealth came into
being he found in its service new fields for
his activities and scope for rapid advance-
ment. He was appointed Commonwealth
Electoral Officer for N.S.W. in 1904; later
he entered the Prime Minister’s Department,
and rose to be Secretary after a spell as
Public Service Commissioner.
Westralian Police-chief CONNELL, who is
retiring at the end of the year.
Harry Shelton, a leader at the criminal
Bar, passed out in Melbourne last week at
45, after an illness of several weeks. Son
of an inspector of schools, he entered the
State Service 26 years ago, studied law in
his spare time, got through in 1912, and
steadily made his way to the front. Until
law obsessed him. he was a line athlete, and
represented his State at rowing and Bugby
football.
Sixty-nine Australians gained the Vic-
toria Cross ; but a dozen were killed in doing
it. Four were won in the S. African war;
two of the holders still live —Bell, of West-
ralia, and Wylly, of Tasmania. The youngest
Australian V.C. in the Great War was
Private Jackson (19y. 9m.) ; the oldest,
Major Newland (35y. 9m.). The first
V.C. won was by Jaeka, who died a few
months ago. Not many of them see their
names much in the papers these days.
Blackburn, of Adelaide, being a lawyer-
politician, and P. V. Storkey, also a bar-
rister and a N.S.W. Crown Prosecutor, get
oftenest into print; though Dunstan, Assist-
ant manager of Melbourne “Herald” publi-
cations, occasionally is mentioned —as when
the other day he earned the thanks of the
Australian Newspapers’ Conference “for
work done in connection with sales tax on
blocks and photographs and the taxation of
libel costs.” Dunstan has probably done as
good climbing as any of them sin ;-e getting
back into civvies. When the war started he
was a youngster in the office of Snows, the
Ballarat drapers.
Martin Peter
Hansen, who suc-
ceeded Prank
Tate as Director
of Education in
Victoria, had
poor health after
he had climbed
to the top place
in his depart-
ment, and died
at the week-end
after a long ill-
ness, aged only
SS. He was a
brilliant scholar,
more interested
personally in sec-
ondary schools
than in the
primaries he
was for years a
master at Wesley
—and it was for
the secondary
schools that he
did his most im-
portant work.

Adelaide lias surprised itself by having
a Mayoral election. The usual difficulty is
to get someone to become Mayor, and for
years past a Glover-Moulden-Bonython com-
bination has obliged. But when, this year,
Aid. John Bees had a shot at the chair,
C. B. J. Glover, who has occupied it for the
past two years, opposed him, and went back
with a majority of 786.

This co. controls a group of tobacco-manu-
facturing subsidiaries which constitute one
of the largest industrial organisations in
the Commonwealth. At the end iof October its
own £9,650,272 of funds, together with £80,349
coming to creditors, etc., was invested
this way : £7,772,192 (cost), shares in other
cos.; £1,994,919, debtors and debit balances
(mainly advances to the pups) ; £13,509,
cash. The operating cos. include W. D. and
H. O. Wills, British Australian Tobacco,
the States Tobacco Go. and S. T. Leigh, the
printers and carton-makers. The curtain
has been kept drawn over their accounts;
but the holding co.’s figures leave no doubt
about the pups having been a very profitable
lot in the past; hence the parent’s scrip
is amongst the leaders in the market.
For a dozen years or so after the public
became interested, shortly before the war,
a steady 12 p.c. was paid, sweetened with
£628,591 of bonus scrip. Then the two-for-
five gift in ’27 (it called for £2,324,131,
and was provided by writing up the book
value of shares in other cos.) lifted paid
capital to the present £9,619,186 in 1,484,727
prefs. and 8,134,459 ords. The pref. div.
was lifted from 6 p.c. to 61 p.c.; the ord.
div. was lowered to 10 p.c., but rose to
12 p.c. again in ’3O.
But conditions have changed vastly during
the last couple of years. The spring in
exchange, tariff and income and other taxes
has swelled outgoings, while the public has
curtailed its expenditure on smokes, and
competition has sharpened. Since the middle
of 1930 the consumption of cigarettes made
from imported leaf lias fallen away by over
33 p.c., while Government charges on these
cigarettes have risen from 9s. 3d. per pound
in 1929 to 12s. Bd. last year. Hence there
was a sharp contraction of £326,745 in this
holding co.’s net profit in ’3l, followed by
a further slip of £162,628 last year, when
the ord. div. was lowered to 6 p.c. Whether
the pups sent along more or less than they
earned last year can, of course, only be
guessed at. All that seems certain is that
their earnings are likely to continue on a
lower scale than of recent years.
Nevertheless, the market prices the ords.
at 335. 7d. as against 255. 6d. in September,
1931. At the higher figure the return is
3.5 p.c. on a 6 p.c. div. basis; thus the
investor who looks for no more than 4.7
p.c. on his money counts on an 8 p.c. div.
The pref. div. is free from the 22J p.c. cut
under the N. S. Wales interest-reduction
Act, but is subject to a deduction of 2s. in
the £ in respect of the Federal tax on income
from property. Allowing for this, the prefs.
at 295. 6d. return 3.9 p.c.

The weeding out of dead lines, the livening
of others, the stopping up of outlets, the
provision of better facilities by alterations
and additions to premises and the placing
of the Maoriland business on a better footing
enabled the div. to be lifted from 8 p.c. to
10 p.c. in March, 1927, and a p.c. bonus
was added IS months later. But slump re-
duced turnover and complicated the debts
problem, while exchange and primage raised
the cost of imported books and periodicals.
Thus the div. is back to 8 p.c. again; and
8 p.c. has called for £2232 more than the
disclosed net earnings over the last 18
months.
Gross earnings, which fell sharply from
£87,070 for the September half of ’29 to
~41,7.i3 for the March half of ’32, were
£45,897 for the six months covered by the
accounts. Exes. (£22,439) advanced
£3058 leaving the net result £542 shy of
the all round 8 p.c. div. requirements. Still,
the outlook generally is better than it was,
the Government has lifted the primage on
imported literature and earnings may be
expected to benefit, though traders complain
that the State lottery in N. S. Wales con-
tinues to affect the book business there.
Partly because of the improved outlook,
partly because interest rates are down, the
market lengthened its bid for the ords. from
265. a year ago to 31s. 6d. last week-end.
Over the same period the prefs.—they carry
a fixed cumulative 8 p.c. and have priority
as to dividend only-advanced from 225. 6d.
to 30s. On an 8 p.c. div. basis the return
at 31s. 6d. and 30s. is 5.1 p.c. and 5.3 p.c.
respectively. The net tangible cover is 28s.

ments, cash, etc., was strengthened by £9434.
To do all this £10,965 was tacked on to
the amount coming to sundry creditors and
stocks were reduced by £8521. Altogether
the more or less liquid surplus (£519,633,
including stocks) improved £5949.

In Victoria, where the first four machines
were installed towards the close of accounts
in 1931, operating costs (on a turnover
basis) are about double what they are in
N. S. Wales (the minimum bet in Vic. is
ss. as against 10s. in the other State). So,
notwithstanding the erection of a new
machine at Ascot (Vic.), of another on a
dog track in England and completion of the
Miami, U.S.A., installation, gross profits for
the 12 months covered by the latest accounts
(£33,205) fell away £1713. Nevertheless,
a cut of £7003 in exes. (£23,655) left the
net result £5290 better at £9550, of which
£9155 was on account of foreign earnings.
Still, the pref. div. and 3 p.c. to the ords.
—they were passed by in the two preceding
years—called for £BO more profit than
was claimed. Much depends upon the extent
to which exes, can be further curtailed, and
upon the extension of business in America
and Europe; prospects are said to be favor-
able in both quarters, and improved jmechan-
ism devised for checking tickets sold is
expected to help.
Since 1918 the ords. have averaged only
5.6 p.c., including a 25 p.c. bonus (£47,956),
paid from £lOO,OOO received for the English
rights (exes, ran off with the difference).
The French subsidiary has been a drag,
and the co. would welcome a suitable
buyer for the business. The French
co.' has £200,000 of capital, one-half
10 p.c. cum. prefs. and the other half
ords. The parent took the ords. in part
payment for rights, and guaranteed the pref.
div. To June 30 last it had been called upon
for £25,823 in respect of the guarantee, and
had advanced the pup £16,530 for trading
purposes besides. Whether the ords. are
ever likely to be worth anything will depend
largely upon whether the business can be
sold, and on what terms.
The financial position improved :

Thus reductions totalling £24,365 in stocks,
book debts and cash, together with surplus
earnings, enabled the amount coming to out-
siders to be reduced by £28,924. The more
or less liquid surplus (£69,715. including
stocks, but not shares) improved £4559. The
contraction of £14,861 in the book value of
patents, plant, etc., is due to the writing off
of £16,595 from the reserve for deprecia-
tion. etc., reducing it to £120,654, of which
£lOO,OOO was represented by ords. in the
French subsidiary.
The prefs. at 18s. 6d. return 8.3 p.c., after
allowing for the statutory cut. At 10s. the
ords. return 6 p.c. on a 3 p.c. div. basis.

This energetic manufacturer of canned foods
and condiments has a splendid record. It
began at Richmond (Vic.) in 1910 with a
paid capital of £lOO,OOO. Progress was slug-
gish until the war ended; but during the
decade to the close of accounts in 1929 it
gathered £200,000 of fresh capital, issued
£25,000 of bonus scrip and paid divs. averag-
ing 13.2 p.c. Then, for a while, slump made
it unprofitable to export fruit from Aus-
tralia ; there was a consequent glut in the local
market, where Government-financed factories
were selling their outputs at below cost.
Thus Rosella’s net earnings in ’3l fell to less
than half the ’29 figure, and the div. was
lowered to 6 p.c. During the 12 months cov-
ered by the latest accounts prices steadied,
local demand was firmer, there was marked
improvement in the export trade, especially
with Asia, and gross earnings sprang £9709:

After striking off an extra £2965 for
depreciation, etc., enough remained to show
9.2 p.c. on capital as against 6.9, 10, 16.3,
10.3, 20.6 and 19.9 p.c. back to 1926. The
policy has been to distribute profits as they
were earned, so a couple of points were
added to the div., making it 8 p.c.
The market expresses its confidence in
the management and the future by pricing
the pound shares at 355. 6d. as against 235.
two years ago. The return at 355. 6d. is
p.c. on an 8 p.c. div. basis, or 5.6 p.c. should
the distribution climb to 10 p.c. Allowing
for the div. and excluding the tax reserve
(£10,000), the backing is 235. 9d. in net
tangibles, of which 10s. 7d. was surplus-
liquids and the balance plant, etc., worth
what it can earn.
There was marked improvement in the

(£11,761). Stocks were reduced by £36,433
and debtors’ balances by £10,012; both
healthy movements when considered in rela-
tion to the spring in earnings. The year’s

plus (£223,969, including stocks and shares)
was £19,271.

For the three years after the public be-
came interested in 1924 the board wrote
net profit so evenly at 13i p.c. on capital
that many began to think the profit figures
were manufactured, too. Meanwhile share-
holders had put up an extra £96,406, includ-
ing £10,726 of share premiums, to help
finance the installation of a new Nathan
brewing plant, and provide for general ex-
pansion of the business. The work inter-
fered with the 1928 figures; then the sudden
change in conditions brought losses instead
of profits, and shareholders have gone
hungry for the last three years.
The losses have been due largely to pro-
vision for depreciation and bad and doubtful
debts, etc. In 1930 the provision for de-
preciation was shown separately for the first
time at £83,308 —this was made up of
£12,805 from p. and 1., £37,272 from general
reserves and £33,531 previously undisclosed.
The board says it has pursued a conservative
policy, and the figures support the claim.
Gross earnings, which fell from £43,270 in
1927 to £17,286 in 1930, were £43,066 for
the 12 months to July last. The improve-
ment was thus £17,057, while ordinary trad-
ing exes. (£18,088) were only £330 heavier.
After setting aside £12,028 for depreciation
and £14,288 for bad debts, etc., the loss was
£1338, or £17,383 lighter than in the previous
year. Excluding specific reserves, £33,623
of the capital was unrepresented by tangibles
in the books at July 31. At that date the
total provision for depreciation (£108,332)
was equal to 36.4 p.c. of the book value of
fixed assets, and the reserve against book
debts, etc. (£26,276) was equal to 14s. sd. in
the £ of debtors’ balances. If carefully
handled, only a small percentage of these
should result in losses; so independent
valuers said a year ago. Shareholders’ pros-
pects of getting back into the picture appear
to be encouraging.
The financial position shows further im-
provement :

Last year’s allowance for depreciation,
etc., enabled the amount coming to sundry
creditors to be reduced by £15,870. The
growth in the more or less liquid surplus
(£32,557, including stocks) was £14,311,
making the spring £22,763 over the last
two years.
The market prices the fully-paid pound
ords. at 15s. 9d.; at which figure the return
would be 6.3 p.c. on a 5 p.c. div. basis.

That there has been something rotten in the
state of Denmark is plain from the fact
that divs. have averaged only 4.3 p.c. over
the last half-dozen years; whereas for the
five years before that they averaged 14.5 p.c.
To meet competition from overseas it was
decided to link up with nine others in the
trade; and one big operating co., United
Felt Hats Pty., was formed in 1925. Details
of the merger were not disclosed; but the
Denton co. received £157,775 in scrap for
its plant, stocks, etc. These shares it took
into its own sheet at £66,379 (= Bs. sd.
each), and visible reserves benefited by
£23,017.
The pty. has not yet paid a div. It was
admitted that its trading loss for the 12
months to June 30, 1931, was £17,569, not-
withstanding that stocks had been taken into
account at about £30,000 above market value.
However, savings of over £36,000 p.a. wei'e
expected to follow an overhaul of the organ-
isation, including the closing down of the
Sydney factory and the transfer of opera-
tions from Fairfield to the Denton mills.
The Sydney business made losses aggregat-
ing £20,000 for the five years to June 30.
1930. For the 12 months to that date the
co.’s Victorian mills netted £14,500. Exchange
and the tariff have since eliminated much
overseas competition; thus shareholders may
be rewarded next year, the chairman of the
Denton co. says.
Reconstruction of the pty.’s capital
account has been spoken of; but this is not
expected to affect the figure at which the
Denton co.’s holding appears in its own
sheet:—

Thus each pound of capital was covered by
net assets with a book value of 31s. at
Aug. 31—Government securities, mortgages,
etc., 7s. Bd.; freehold, Bs.; shares 15s. 4d.
The market prices the scrip at 18s. as
against 13s. a year ago. At 18s. the
return is 2| p.c. on a 2J p.c. div. basis.
Each 1 p.c. of dividend received from the
pty. would be equal to 1.8 p.c. on this coGs
£86,420 of capital.
Photomaton (Vic.), Ltd.
The brief history of this little concern
illustrates the speculative character of invest-
ment in novelty devices. In 1928 a syndi-
cate, representing Sydney and Melbourne
interests, bought the Australian rights in an
automatic photographic machine from the
Photomaton parent corporation of London
for £43,000-odd. Incidentally, the English
concern was one of the Hatry group, which
went to the wall upon the collapse of that
gentleman’s financial machinations —in these
the Australian interests were in no way
implicated. -
Since the English co.’s scrip had been at
a high premium on the London market, there
was a rush to get into the Sydney co.,
Photomaton, Ltd., which had been formed
to take over the Australian rights. It
kicked off with a paid capital of £lOO,OOO.
But before it had put more than a few
machines on the market the public had lost
interest in the novelty, and the whole busi-
ness fell flat. Within a year or so after
registration the co. went into liquidation,
with heavy loss to its shareholders.
Meanwhile the public had put a further
£40,000 into this Victorian subsidiary, which
paid £lO.OOO (in scrip) for photomaton
rights in its own State. Presently it took
over the parent’s assets and bought the busi-
ness of Studios Pty., Ltd., thus extending
its activities into the field of general photo-
graphy. But by the end of June, 1930, the
board figured that three-fifths of the capital
had been lost; so the scrip issued for rights
was cancelled, and half the remaining capital
was written off, reducing the figure to the
present £20,000 in 2s. 6d. shares.
Still, the business has continued to drift.
For the year to June 30 only three of the
fifteen photomaton machines were in use,
and a loss of £1023 was recorded, raising in-
tangibles to £5985. To meet £1034 of out-
side liabilities there were book debts (£4353)
and cash (£29S) totalling £4651. Stocks
figured at £2354. and plant at £8044. What-
ever hope there is for shareholders now lies
in the photographic-studio side of the busi-
ness. The book value of the net tangible
cover for the 2s. Od. shares is Is. 9d.
New England Producers’ Co.
This is the New England, North and
North-west Producers’ Co., Ltd., which came
on to the market early in 1928 with 300,000
£1 shares. The idea was to plunge into the
pastoral-finance and agency business, and
to establish wool sales on a large scale on
a semi-co-operative basis at Newcastle. But
the idea failed to catch on. At June 30 only
£59,888 of capital had been gathered on
the 89,770 shares on the register. Trading
results have been disastrous, due partly to
a costly fight for business, and partly to
the sharp fall in prices, which affected com-
mission earnings:—•
1928. 1929. 1930. 1931. 1932.
Sales £1,270 £8,512 £15,190 £14,060 £13,672
Net loss.. 6,169 13,504 15,711 14,668 5,263
Deficit . . 17,539 31,767 47,478 62,146 67,409
The reduction of £9405 in last year’s loss
was due to savings in exes. The quantity
of wool sold is not mentioned, but it is said
to have increased by 6 p.c. last year, making
the growth 16 p.c. over the last two years.
Also, quick clearances at prices well up to
average for type are reported, notwithstand-
ing that the National Council of Wool Sell-
ing Brokers does not allot selling days at
Newcastle, and warehousing charges have
been reduced. Early in the piece the co.
paid £4574 for the goodwill of R. A. Elkin
and Son, fat-stock salesmen. In this section
sales continue to expand at Newcastle, but
the board speaks of withdrawing from Flem-
ington.
Whether the uncalled capital, or some of
it, will presently be required depends upon
how soon the business can be got on to a
profit-earning basis, and continued support
from the bank, which has agreed to advance
up to £50,000 on wool, the board says. Actu-

A man can feel happy when
his family is protected.
THE man who has made
provision for his wife
and family, by means of
an A.M.P. policy, can look
the world in the eye. He can
throw out his chest. He can
VENTURE—launch out on
his own account without tre-
pidation—LlFT HIS NOSE
OFF THE GRINDSTONE
when he feels like it.
And what does this peace of
mind cost? A few shillings
a week!
A man in good health, aged
30, can take out an A.M.P.
policy for £lOOO, payable at
death, at a half-yearly cost of
£l2/5/-, less than ten shillings
a week. Invested at 5 per
cent, that sum would bring in
an income of a pound a week.
Not enough, of course, but
very useful to a widow, and,
but wait, he may live for
many years, and A.M.P.
policies GROW. They grow
amazingly.
A.M.P. bonuses, declared
annually, have a way of
doubling the value of a policy
in time. As a matter of fact,
one policy for £5OO issued in
1875 was paid recently, and
the representatives received
£1498/2/-. The longer a
man lives the larger the value
of his policy when he dies,
and the greater his peace of
mind while he lives.
The wise man takes out as
large a policy as he can afford,
and adds to it as his income
grows. The wise wife sees
that he does it. There is an

Mt. Morgan is offering those on the
register at Dec. 21 one new pound share at
par for every four held. In November the
scrip touched 375. 3d. in the market, but
had dropped back to 295. at last week-end.
At 295. the rights are worth 7s. 2d., sub-
ject to brokerage. When all the money is
in, the issue will advance paid capital to
£144,000-odd. The cash is to be spent on a
new fine-grinding section, and on further
repairs and renewals in connection with the
old plant. The unit now in operation is hand-
ling 120 tons of ore daily; this figure is
to be increased by 50 p.c. within a fort-
night, and the 500 tons per day mark is
expected to be reached within five months.
With gold at £7 7s. 3d. per ounce (Aus-
tralian currency), and copper at £4O per
ton, the co. figures the gross value of the
ore overlying the Linda level (664,000 tons)
at 365. 3d. per ton; costs are put at 205.,
leaving a working profit of 16s. 3d. per ton,
or £117,000 on an annual throughput of
144,000 tons of stone.

The silver market doesn’t mean to Bioken
Hill what it once did, but a rise of a shilling
or two an 'ounce would still be worth having.
For the 16J years from the middle of 1915
to the end of last year Associated Smelters
at Port Pirie (before 1915 they belonged
to the Broken Hill Prop.) turned out over
104 million dunces. Last year’s little lot
was 7,020,0000 z. There is a small quantity
of gold in nearly all Broken Hill silver.
Nowadays it is practically all recovered;
last year’s save was 37020 z.

Mt. Isa (Q.) has installed three large May
plunger-jigs, similar to those in use at the
Barrier. The idea is to' recover the coarsely-
crushed lead concentrate early in the treat-
ment, and thus ease the load on the flotation
plant and improve recoveries in that section.
For November, when 62,966 tons, assaying
11.4 p.c. lead, were milled, the jigs recovered
1756 tons assaying 48.5 p.c. lead and 20.30 z.
silver; whereas in the flotation section the
grade was 44.4 p.c. lead and 19.40 z. of
silver. Thus the jigs appear to be doing
their work all right, with, of course, large
savings in costs.
* x * #
At Isa (Q.) the other day a workman was
killed; but the custom of calling on all his
fellow-workmen to lose a shift was aban-
doned. There were some protests, of course,
against “sabotaging an ancient custom.” As
a matter of fact, it isn’t an ancient custom:
it grew up only in the flush times, after the
Communists had taught that it was a good
thing to nark the boss even though you suf-
fered more in the process than he did.

“Cuzinjan”: In October the Golden Sur-
prise, in the Gympie area (Q.), crushed
220 tons for the excellent yield of 2820 z.
The cyanide plant will be in operation
shortly, and should greatly improve the re-
covery. Capital is to be increased, and the
option of purchase over the adjoining Ex-
tended mine completed. This latter co. is
developing a reef 9in. wide, assaying well
over an ounce to the ton.

At the Great Northern, Herberton (Q.), a
small seam of ore on the 582 ft. level has
opened up to a foot wide, showing rich tin.
The ore is going strong underfoot, and the
find is looked upon as giving new life to
the old producer. A crushing of 31 tons
recently made yielded 3i tons of tin oxide,
worth £320.

The old Occidental, three miles south of
Cobar (N.S.W.), is to be unwatered and
sampled by a Sydney syndicate, which has
a capital of £22,500. The mine was first
worked for copper, but gold values increased
with depth, and up to 1918, when work
ceased owing to high costs, over 800,000 tons
of sulphides averaging lOdwt. gold had been
treated. The orebodies, which are lenticular
along the strike, cut across sandstone coun-
try. The gossan lode is from 12ft. to 20ft.
wide, and the big lode 80ft. wide and 650 ft.
long. This latter lode 'has been worked out
above the 540 ft. level, but between this and
the bottom level (740 ft.) there is at least
120,000 tons of lOdwt. stuff. It is proposed
to continue sinking from the 740 ft. level.
The ore promises to respond readily to
flotation, roasting and cyaniding.
x x' x x
Asia Amalgamated has exercised its option
over the show at Wyalong (N.S.W.), and
has taken up several leases to the north and
south as well. The numerous outcrops
which are being tested indicate an ore chan-
nel at least 100 ft. wide. A recent crushing
of development ore gave 220 z. from 15 tons.
* * * *
“Quidam”: Now, when the price of gold
is rocketing, is the time to test some of the
old alluvial leads in Victoria, especially those
which were rich in flour-gold. Most of this
used to go out with the dirty water into
the slime dams, which were largely respon-
sible for the dyaniding industry in Victoria.
The right to retreat these slimes used to be
sold to Chinamen, who put them over their
so-called quicksilver cradles (an ingenious
canvas-covered concentrating table). Though
it was practically impossible to obtain the
smallest color of gold in any heap that had
been so treated, from 3dwt. to 4dwt. was
extracted from many of these heaps by
cyanide later on, at a cost of from 2s. to 3s.
The point is that the old-time diggers were
only after the coarse gold, and in many cases
a good bit of that as well as the flour-gold
was left behind in the pipeclay bottom and
the headings. There should be millions of
tons in some of these old leads that ought
to pay if worked on a large scale with a
cyanide plant to save the fine gold. Years
ago several small parties did well by sinking
on the edges of some of these old leads,
catching the coarse gold by puddling and
cyaniding the slimes. Water didn't beat
the old-timers, so it should be of small
moment nowadays. It is the flour-gold leads
that need to be looked for; there is nothing
worth cyaniding from ordinary coarse gold
leads.

The Bendigo (Vic.) gold yield for Novem-
ber was 32950 z. fine, as against 17350 z. for
November of last year. The field’s output
for the first eleven month's of this year
totals 19,4350 z., an increase of 59250 z. com-
pared with the corresponding period of 1931.
The chief producers and their recovery and
tonnage figures were the Hercules, 66040 z.
from 839 S tons, mostly from the new reef
below the 1620 ft. level; New Red, White and
Blue, 25700 z., 11,547 tons; Ironbark, 25140 z.,
9923 tons; New Red, White and Blue No.
2, SoBoz., 3810 tons. Prospectors and pri-
vate claim-holders contributed 69220 z., chiefly
alluvial. The Hercules’s new shoot has
yielded 51960 z. from 2704 tons since July,
and still looks well in the north drive and
stopes. New Red, White and Blue is
increasing its mill capacity to 500 tons
weekly, and to enable additional ore to be
mined the water is to be lowered from
900 ft. to 1820 ft. At present this co. is
treating 400 tons of 3dwt. stuff each week,
and is just about making ends meet.
# * * *
The deep-lead at Ivooroocheang, near Cres-
wick (Vic.), is to be tested by a syndicate
which proposes to unwater a 210 ft. shaft
in use over 60 years ago. It is believed
that alluvial gold will be met at much shal-
lower depth.
* Si* *
Geophysical prospecting by the electrical
method is in progress at Cassilis, near Omeo
(Vic.) ; the idea is to locate further arseno-
pyrite-gold reefs. Also, at King Cassilis, a
mile from the. Cassilis, the National Gold
Mining and Milling Co., of which H. W.
Gepp is managing director, is reported to
have evolved a satisfactory treatment.

The Titanium Products Co.’s magnetic
separation plant has commenced treating the
extensive black-sand deposits at Naracoopna,
King Island (Tas.). The ilmenite concen-
trate will be shipped to the works at Brook-
lyn (Vic.), where white titanium oxide will
be produced as a pigment.
South Australia’s copper glories have all
departed; a preliminary estimate of the
year’s output for the whole State puts it at
about £lOOO. Apart from iron ore (for
the B. 11. Prop.’s Newcastle works), salt is
now the Stale's principal mineral. It is
“mined” with a plough. But it. is a slack
year when the crop isn’t worth £150,000.

In London big wads., of Westralian gold-
mining shares, particularly Lake Views,
Boulders and Wilunas, have changed hands
lately. There has been a strong demand for
South Kalgurlis, but sellers have been sitting
tight. Perseverances were dealt in largely
for a time; then the wretched note business
put a damper on turnover. One of the
smaller financial weeklies considers the pos-
sibility of B. H. Prop, and other powerful
interests collaring control of some of the
Kalgoorlie mines far from remote.

When the last nut has been screwed home,
Lake View and Star’s power plant will
generate sufficient electric current to supply
the wants of the Golden Mile. Four units
of 1100 horse-power each are being installed,
and the job is expected to be finished in
April next, thus advancing the monthly capa-
city of the plant to 45.000 tons. Some
trifles, such as a residual oil storage tank
of 100,000 gallons capacity, have yet to
receive attention. Rich shoots, one in a part
of the property hitherto unprospected, are
being opened up at depth, and the Lake
View-is daily bcoming more like several big
goldmines than one.
*
The Princess Roval Co. (Westonia) is
coming with a late but pretty good run. It
was operating a mill at Norseman when
Lake View and Great Boulder were hoping
that their lodes would persist to the 200 ft.
level. After wandering over the country
side, it secured the Westonia show. Though
this was a discouraging affair at the out-
set, the co. persevered, and, unless some-
thing unforeseen happens, shareholders seem
assured of divs. next year. The fourth level
has been opened up, and the co. is pushing
down to the fifth and sixth. A reef 30in.
wide, worth 85s. per ton, is being worked;
the mine and plant have been paid for, and
there is stjll something in the till. Novem-
ber yield was 3280 z. from 372 tons. The co.
has had to obtain what water it wants from
a near-by lease.
* * * *
Kimberley Options is working the quartz
reef that was, until two years ago, sticking
out neglected three feet above the floor of
Lake Raeside, Edjudina. At the time of
its discovery gold could be seen in the quartz
from a yard off. How such an obvious thing
was missed for over thirty years by pros-
pectors is one of the stories of mining. The
reef has gone down all light to a depth of
200 ft., where 24in. of 30dwt. stone has just
been disclosed. This looks good enough to
put the show among the div. payers.
* * * *
Paringa Mining and Exploration Co. has
obtained the services of T. Blatchford, Wcst-
ralia’s Government Geologist, and Ernest
Williams, lately g.m. of Boulder Persever-
ance, to map out a diamond-drilling pro-
gramme on its Kalgoorlie property. The
Paringa lease adjoins the North Kalgurli
and Associated Northern. To date exten-
sive crosscutting from three shafts has pro-
duced little result.
* * * *
Gold’s enhanced price has helped many a
lame mining co. over a stile and Associated
(W.A.) is one. It declared a 6d. div. the
other day—the first for many years.
* * * *
A lode 14ft. wide, assaying up to 16dwt.
per ton, has been located on the 200 ft. level
at the Mopoke, Ora Banda (W.A.), The
wall rock is heavily mineralised, and de-
velopment is being speeded up.

Austral, the small Adelaide co. which
recently took an option on the Associated
Northern’s old Iron Duke mine at Kal-
goorlie, may give up shortly. Comprehen-
sive sampling has shown values to be on the
low side.

On the Golden Dawn mine at Owharoa,
near Waihi (M.L.), a rich branch lode,
junctioning with the main body, has been
struck above No. 2 level. The co. recently
purchased the plant of the Muir Reefs Co.,
and increased tonnages are being put
through. The ore averages 13dwt.

QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred -from Service Department.)
I intend dredging a creek for fine gold.
(1) What width of sluicebox is required for
din. gravel pump? (2) Fall for box 40 ft.
long? (3) Best method of saving the gold?
(4) Power necessary to drive two din. cen-
trifugal pumps? —322o.
(1) Three to four feet. (2) Depends on
nature of gravel, 1 in 16 to 1 in 12, or
greater. (3) Riffles in the bottom of the
sluicebox. (4) Cannot say definitely; pro-
bably about 10 to 12 h.p.
BRIEF ANSWERS.
W.L.: (1) Exactly what is to be done with the
forests has not been definitely decided yet. A
realisation committee, on which both bondholders
and the co. are represented, is investigating “the
widest possible range of utilities derivable from
the forests, costs of production of each, and probable
markets.” (2) See “ ‘Wild Cat’ Monthly,” August,
1932....L.F.: Sell No. 2, hold the rest. .. .R.C.:
N. S. Wales Mines Department has no information
additional to that published in its annual reports
concerning returns from the Great Britain....
Jasmine: (1) Impossible. (2) Yes. (3) It is a
reasonable conclusion... .Miser: There are no restric-
tions on the sale of gold within the Commonwealth.
The mint sells to jewellers, dentists, etc-, at the
current market price. The Commonwealth Bank
Act, however, authorises the board to call upon
holders of gold bullion and coin to exchange it
for Australian notes at £3 17s. IOJd. per standard
ounce. This authority has not been exercised thus
far; it was given before exchange complicated the
problem.

MRS GRUNDY'S MISSION.
BY- KATHARINE SUSANNAH PRICHARD.
PETERTNG-OUT of old claims and mines
on the ridge at Faraway has left
Ryan’s Hotel high and dry on the track
to the coast. The township which gathered
about them i.s almost deserted nowadays;
hut Ryan’s still stands for comfort and
coolness in a country of waterless bluebusli
plains and arid ridges under the bloom and
blush of limitless skies.
No more than a bush hostelry of corru-
gated iron, whitewashed, with verandah over
gravelled paths, and vines spreading green
lit one side; the long frame Of the tap-room
door gives a picture of broad dusty road,
with long, low, blue-misted hills of thick :
clustering trees beyond. And Mick Ryan
stands there behind his bar, in slippers
trodden down at the heel, a high-topped
black felt hat on his head, breeches held
under his belly by a leather belt, shirt
sleeves rolled up from hard brown arms.
From looking like a legendary hero, Mick
has become almost a legend himself. He
could live like a lord if he wished, but. he
does not. “What a man does not want he
does not lack,” he says; and he likes to
stand at the bar of his house, watching
the world go by along the road, with its
great dead gum iii the middle, and the
siding a few yards away. A train breasts
this siding two or three times a week, and
wriggles away north or south, screeching and
snuffling. But not. before the passengers
and train-crew have eaten and refreshed
themselves at Ryan’s,, if they can manage it.
No man, by car or on foot, passes Mick
Ryan s without a word or a drink these
days. Though it matters nothing to Mick
whether they do or they don’t. He goes
Ins own way, with the modesty and indiffer-
ence of a man who knows his power, takes
from life what he needs, and bothers about
nobody s opinion.
Tou ought to get one of these acetylene
gas-lamps to hang up there, Mr. Ryan,”
a stranger told him one evening, pointing
to the old hurricane lantern hanging over
the door.
The lamp I’ve got’s been good enough
for me these thirty-odd years,” Mick said.
1 get all the gas I want in this bar.”
. We were sitting on bag chairs under the
vines at the I araway. Still and dreaming in
the moonlight, the wide road lay before us:
that great dead gum in mid-stream silver
against smudged ridges. Only the men’s
cigarette-butts and the ash in their pipe-
bowls glowed in the dusk under the vines,
although the old hurricane lantern hung
there on the hook in front of the bar, its
tongue, a thin yellow flame, stuck out, to
warn travellers that this was Ryan’s, the
only hotel on the long overland track between
Coolgardie and the coast.
“It’s the truth I’m telling you,” Mick
protested, going on with liis story, the gay
whimsical note of, the Gael in his voice
rising. * “Tim Reverend Tom Hearty him-
self asked O’Callaghan, the publican in
' oolgardie, for a subscription to the Angli-
ca?i church building funds. O’Callaghan
said, bem art R. 0., he couldn’t subscribe to
a I rotestant church, but he’d give the Rev-
GIFTS TO THE BRIDE.
ANDY: "To tell you the truth, I wasn’t much shook on her, but now I has a look at.
all them lovely presents yous all have brought I’m convinced I done the "right
thing."
erend Tom a hogshead of beer to raffle. And
he did; and the raffle made £lOO for the
church. The Presbyterians made a bit of a
song about it. But there was a Methodist- 1 —
what was his name?”
“The Reverend Benjamin Sparrow.”
Mrs. Ryan’s voice lifted out from the
doorway. She was sitting there on the
step, leaning against the wall, a little weary
after her day’s work in the
kitchen. A kerosene lamp in
the passage behind her out-
lined her side and shoulders
with a golden thread; and
light touched the work-worn
hands lying quietly on her
lap, though her face was
blurred as it turned towards
Michael.
The Reverend Benjamin Sparrow it
was/ Mick agreed.
‘‘though you would call the poor fellow
1 <A< - rlgg > Michael,” Mary remembered
. or . Sparrow, what does it matter?”
said Mick. If ever there was a man well-
named it was that one. He was like a
cock-sparrow as any man yon ever set eyes
oii. Altogether satisfied with himself and
so disgusted with his brethren of the cloth
in the devil s kitchen Coolgardie was in
those days. _ But he was never the same
man after his visit to Faraway that Christ-
inas Fitly Nancarrow was married and
Corney West got burnt out.”
<Tf. good thing - t00 >” Mrs - Ryan said.
What sort of a man was he to tell a
woman he couldn’t set foot in her house,
an .d tnei'o not a decenter in the country?”
..Co™*-’ Speck Jones exclaimed.
Whats become of him? He was up at
Bay Dawn when I had a bit of a show
there. Him and Charley de Goose ran a
sly-grog and gambling shop on the rush..
Damme. -They d gamble on anything.
Charley had an old goose used to pick up
marbles, and we’d bet on the marbles she’d
take. Corney had a poker school goin’
three weeks, day and night, one time. Mexi-

continued. “The Faraway was booming in

Said the new Methodist minister would be
driving down with him to marry Kitty

expected to be with us for dinner on Sun-

Reverend Tom was hankering for. ‘And tell
Mick to put a couple of bottles of beer on

The bag chairs creaked, as men shuffled
and chuckled, smoking lazily. It was a
good joke that. Ice on the Faraway!
“Well,” continued Mick, when the men’s
laughter had subsided, “there was the missus

“The pie was in the oven and the beer in

end Tom’s buggy and horses pulled up out-
side. Towards midday it was, and a
blisterin’ hot day, a great wind tearing the
dust along. The horses were just about

not lookin’ much better. They’d got off the

“ ‘Come along in/ she says. ‘Miek’ll see

“The Reverend Tom,

he, and walks over to

“‘ln where?’ says
Mary, innocent as a
lamb, looking about her,
and him staring at our
fronts doors as if Hell
itself was lying behind
them.
“‘Come on, man,
don’t be a fool,’ says
the Reverend Tom.
“ ‘What?’ says Mary,
thinking the Reverend
Sprigg, or whatever they
called him, was wander-
ing in his brain, with
the. heat and journey
besides. ‘Has he got a
touch of the sun
“ ‘No-’ says Benjamin.
No. I’m sorry. But
I could not eat a meal
in that house.’
. “ ‘Couldn’t eat a meal
m my house?’ says
Mary.
“‘I could not eat a meal in a public
house, says he.
sa ys she, thinking to humor him.
Well, you can take it out and eat it under
the tree there, if you like.’
“ ‘But you can’t get a meal anywhere
else m Faraway, man,’ says the Reverend
loin. And. Mr. and Mrs. Ryan are old
friends of mine.
“‘I must say I’m surprised at you, Mr
Hearty,’ says the Reverend Sprigg. ‘A min-
ister of the gospel to —to patronise a public
house. What will people say? The members
of your congregation ?’
i :
“‘Members of me congregation? There
aren’t any, you silly ass,’ says the Rever-
end Tom. ‘And if there were, where else
would they expect me to put up but at
Ryan’s? There’s no coffee palaces or board-
ing houses in Faraway. Besides, Mr. and
Mrs. Ryan are old friends of mine, didn’t
I tell you, and I wouldn’t miss a chat, with
them for forty coffee palaces and boarding-
houses.’
“ ‘I regret to hear it,’ says Sprigg.
“ ‘Now, look here, my dear chap/ says
the Reverend Tom, catching hold of the
spadger’s coat-collar and pulling him alcug-
side of him, ‘you’ve got this all wrong.
Michael and Mary Ryan are homely folks.
They keep a decent house. They’ve lived
here for twenty years—are part of the
scenery—what you’d call old identities.
Mary Ryan’s been midwife, free, gratis, for
nothing, to women 41 need on the rushes for
miles around. And many’s the man chasing
weights for a crust Michael’s given the
helping hand. You’d be run out of the
camp if anybody heard you saying a word
against them!’
“ ‘My principles will not allow me to set
toot on hotel premises,’ says the Reverend
Sprigg. And the Reverend Tom lost patience
with him.
“ ‘Very well,’ he says, ‘please yourself.
But you’ll be hungry, and a wiser man by
the end of the day, if I’m not mistaken'.’
“You should’ve seen them out there
11 op pin about like a pair of angry roosters,
and the wind swirling round them. The
Reverend Tom was a big fat man he was.
with a red face like Father Christmas and
curly whiskers, his coat off, shirt and
trousers red with dust, and an old straw
hat on his head. One of those cabbage-tree
hats, with strings and bits of cork danglin’
all round to keep off the flies, he wore for
drivin’ about the country. And the Rever-
end Sprigg, done up in a black alpaca coat,
black hat and Chow trousers. Yellow silk
they were—something like that. The collar-
board round his neck sloppy with sweat, and
the sun blazin’ on the big window-glasses
he had on his eyes.
“ ‘l’ll go and ask Mrs. Grundy for a cup
of tea,’ says Mr. Sprigg.
“ ‘Mrs. Grundy ?’ says Mary.
“ ‘When we were driving into the town
I noticed a mission hut with Mrs Grundy's
,ia me on it,’ says the Reverend Sprigg.
“ ‘Right,’ says the Reverend Tom, grin-
ning at me. ‘You go and ask Mrs. Grundy
for a cup of tea.’
“And off strutted the Reverend Sprigg, as
pleased with himself as if he had routed
the Devil in person, him bein’ Mary and me.
“The Reverend Tom had a pot.‘with me,
here in the shade, and we yarned about old
times, till Mary said dinner was ready. A
real decent old stick he was, the Reverend
Tom Hearty. He’d been up and down the
country for years, and there wasn’t a parson,
even Father McNeil himself, more popular
with the miners and prospectors from Day
Dawn to Southern Cross. Boys on any
rush would go to a service just to oblige
him. He never had any money; how lie
lived God knows. When his parishioners
in Coolgardie subscribed to give him a suit
of clothes, they had to buy it for him them-
selves for fear he’d give the money away.
Even then he passed on the pants to an
old cove who needed them more than he
did himself, the Reverend Tom said.
“Well, Mary’s parrot-pie was one of the
best, every bird brown and juicy. The
Reverend Tom put away half a dozen at a

“McCABE’S OUT!”


hand-gallop, you might say, and there was
the goats’ cheese he’d asked for”
“And a raisin tart,” Mary prompted.
“Even if the beer wasn’t off the ice, with
the sun at 110 or thereabouts in the shade
that day.
“Of course, when the reverend gentleman
went off to have a cup of tea with Mrs.
Grundy, we didn’t think he’d be spending
the afternoon with Corney. Mr. Sprigg
had been giving his brethren of the cloth
a pretty bad time in Coolgardie, it seems,
callin’ them wolves in sheep’s clothing and
what not. So the Reverend Tom thought it
would serve him right to go lookin’ for
Mrs. Grundy. Teach him better manners,
and that there were more ways of bein’
a Christian than goin’ round talkin’ about
it. We expected him back before long.
“There wasn’t a tent or building in Far-
away big enough to hold a crowd of people
except this place in those days. So the
service and christening were to be held at
five in the afternoon under the gum tree
out there; and the wedding at six, with a
spread in the dining-room here, and dancing
to follow.
“Mary didn’t like to think of the poor
man going hungry, she said; put a bit of
dinner in the oven for him to take out and
eat under the tree, if he liked, when lie
came back. She was pretty busy getting
fixed for the wedding breakfast, and the
Reverend Tom went off to the best room
for forty winks after dinner, a bit knocked-
up with the drive down from Coolgardie,
not bein’ as young as he was.
“Corney himself told us afterwards he
got the surprise of liis life when the Rev-
erend Sprigg strolled up that mornin’, and
stood starin’ at the placard beside the front
door of the shack. It was a bit early for
the boys to be collectin’ at Corney’s, and
Corney was tidyin’ up, after a lively time
the night, before.
“ ‘Good mornin’,’ says Mr. Sparrow. ‘ls
Mrs. Grundy in?’
“ ‘No, she isn’t,’ says Corney, wonderin’
what lie had struck.
“ ‘Oh',’ says the Reverend Sprigg, lookin’
blank. ‘She’s not in?’
“ ‘She’s gone for a walk,’ says Corney.
“ ‘Gone for a walk?’ says Sprigg.
“ ‘Yes,’ says Corney, ‘she’s real fond of
goin’ for a walk on Sunday morning.’
“ ‘Will she be out long?’ says Sprigg.
“ ‘You never can tell!’ says Corney. ‘She
might be out all day. It’s so quiet and
peaceful down there be the lake, she says.’
“ ‘Be the lake?’ says Sprigg. ‘I might go
to meet her if I knew the way.’
“ ‘First turnin’ to the right, then take the
track on your left,’ says Corney. ‘Go on
past the old rush and there’s some tracks
off from a shaft Yank Delvar put down be
the Blasted Rock. If you follow the third
on your left, and then make west through
the scrub for a bit, maybe you’d strike her.’
“ ‘Right, left, third on the left, and
then’ The Reverend Sprigg looked be-
wildered, with Corney waving his arms over
the horizon.
“ ‘I might get bushed?’ says Mr. Sprigg.
‘l’ll sit down and wait until Mrs. Grundy
returns, if you don’t mind.’
“ ‘He sits down on the box there under
Corney’s placard, facing the road. He sits
and waits; and waits and sits.
“ ‘A remarkable woman she. must be, Mrs.
Grundy,’ says the Reverend Sprigg after
awhile.
“ ‘She is that,’ says Corney, ‘a re-mark-
able woman.’
“ ‘When I saw this place, and her notice
— Mrs. Grundy’s Mission —among all these
ramshackle huts and miners’ tents, I was
touched—deeply touched,’ says Mr. Sprigg.
'But tell me, friend, is her work blessed?’
“ ‘Blessed?’ says Corney.
“ ‘Do many vof the miners and prospec-
tors attend her meetings?’
DISHEARTENING.
“I don’t know why you men always look so sorry for yourselves after a late night
out.”
“Why, that’s because most of us are married, and have such a job to keep our.
tales up.”
“ ‘You should see them,’ says Corney.
‘The place is packed. It’s standin’ room
only when a game’s on.’
‘“A game?’ says Mr. Sprigg.
“ ‘Meetin’,’ says Corney, takin’ a pull at
himself. •
“ ‘To think that a woman should be sow-
ing the good seed in such rough and stony
ground!’ says Mr. Sprigg, heavin’ a sigh,
‘And when does Mrs. Grundy hold her
meetings?’
“ ‘Any time,’ says Corney. ‘Jest any time
the boys come along.’
“He was beginning to have had enough of
the reverend gentleman, knowing the boys
might be turnin’ up any moment, and not
wantin’ any interference with business. But
ke couldn’t get rid of Mr. Sprigg.
“ ‘Have a glass of hop beer?’ says Corney.
“ ‘Thank you. Thank you very much,
indeed. Mr. ’ says Sprigg.
“ ‘Cornwallis West —Corney for short,
says Corney.
“ ‘lt’s a terrible day, isn’t it, Mr. Corn-
wallis West?’ says Sprigg, moppin’ his face
with a big handkerchief. ‘I don’t know when-
ever I’ve been so thirsty. My name’s
Sparrow. The Reverend Benjamin Sparrow.’
“ ‘Pleased to meet y’r, Mr. Sparrow,’ says
Corney.
“He brought out a glass of hop beer.
Mr. Sprigg drank it off without stoppin’.
He had another glass of Corney’s hop beer.
Corney had a glass. They drank each other’s
health »in Corney’s hop beer.
“ ‘That’s the most refreshing beverage
I’ve tasted for a long time,’ says Mr. Sprigg.
‘I don’t mind telling you, my friend, I was
hoping Mrs. Grundy would ask me to have
a cup of tea with her.’
“ ‘Tea ?’ says Corney, lookin’ as if he
recollected having heard of the stuff. ‘No,’
lie says, ‘she never drinks it.’
“ ‘Never drinks tea?’ says Mr. Sprigg.
“ ‘Nothing stronger than water,’ says
Corney.
“ ‘Oh,’ says the reverend.
“ ‘Have another hop
beer?’ says Corney.
‘I make this meself.’
“ ‘I don’t mind if I
do,’ says Sprigg.
“When the boys
began arriving for a
game in the afternoon
the parson was a
corpse and Corney
singing hymns. The
stuff Corney called
hop beer he used to
make in an old rum
barrel. He would
offer me any money
for a barrel the over-
proof rum came down
in; and on Sunday
afternoons when the
gamblin’ was on,
money on the table
and the dice goin’,
Corney’d hand out his
hop beer.
“ ‘Have a glass of
hop beer?’ he’d say to
any man with a bit
of money on him.
One man’d fall over
and then another;
and when they were
all under the table Corney’d grab the money,
and the boys wouldn’t be any the wiser
when they woke up in the morning.
“Well, things got pretty willin’ at
Corney’s that afternoon. There was the
Reverend Sprigg lyin’ dead to the world at
one side of the, hut, and a bit of an argu-
ment started. Jack Mills and Blunt Pick
had a set-to about something or other, it
seems, and before anybody knew what was
happening it was an all-in go, and Corney’s
beer-bottles flyin’. One of the nastiest
things in the world to crack a man’s head
with, a beer-bottle. The Reverend Sprigg woke
up when somebody stood on his face. He
caught some of the broken glass, and was
fightin’ with the best of them, the boys
say. Then the blaze started. Somebody
must have thrown down a match before the
shindy began. ’Tanyrate, with the roarin’
hot wind there was, when the fire broke
out it took to the bush-timber of the hut
and away she went.
“We was havin’ afternoon tea, the Rev-
erend Tom as fresh as paint after a nap
and shower, praisin’ up the hot scones Mary
had made for him—the three of us sitting
round gossinin’ and beginnin’ to wonder
what had happened to Mr. Sprigg—when in
comes Yank Delvar to say did we know
there’s been a bit. of a rough-up at Corney’s,
the place was burnt out, and who was the
parson down there with the boys?
“The Reverend Tom jumped up at once
to go and rescue his etring brother. He had
to get Yank and Ed Fletcher help him bring
the Reverend Sprigg here and put him to
bed. You never saw such a mess as the
cocksparrow was in. He couldn’t stand on
his legs, had lost his hat, there was a great
gash on his forehead, his collar and board
and his yellow trousers were all over blood
and dirt. And, of course, everybody in
Faraway saw him dragged along from
Corney’s. They knew ‘Mrs. Grundy’s
Mission.’ if he didn’t.
“The christening and wedding services
were to have been held out there, under the
gum-tree, in the middle of the road ; but the
identical minute the Reverend Tom was
going out in his white shirt, water in his
silver cup and all, the mothers and babies
standin’ out there waitin’ for him, with all
the men, women and children from the rushes
for miles around, up comes a duststorm as
thick as blazes, and there was a stampede
for this place. Y’d have thought the dumps
were standin’ on end in the air. The sand
and grit pelted along fit to blind you. Old
Honeybun found a couple of ’weights in
his ear afterwards, someone was tellin’ me.
Then the thunder and lightning began; and
tlie rain tumbled down from beyond in
sheets, fair straight sheets, without a bend

TRAINING NOTES.
SENIOR LOCAL PREACHER TREDINNICK (addressing the brethren ): “Lastly, brethren, we
must bear in mind th’ dear Looard bain't deaf, so ’ee needn’t bust thy bilers
a-bellerin’ at Un; an’ likewise ’E bain’t blind, so ’E can see ’ee (peekin’ thro’
the cracks ’tween thy fingers during prayer to see how the congregation do be
takin’ thy poorin’ fooarth.”
“ ‘Oh well,’ says the Reverend Tom, ‘how
about it? It’s a christening I came down to
perform, but more like a drowning the poor
children will get out there in the weather.
Can we have the bar parlor, Mick?’
“ ‘Of course, you can,’ says I; ‘Father
McNeil has heard confessions in there before
now.’
“In two-twos we had forms and chairs
lined up in the parlor, and the table moved
to one end for the riverint gentleman to
put his books and silver cup on. Mary
brought a vase of flowers from the dining-
room, where the tables were all set ready
for the weddin’ breakfast, and we took down
the big picture of the Holy Family over
our bed and put it up for the Reverend Tom
to stand under. And there was the bar
parlor lookin’ as sober and decent a chapel
as ever you set eyes on —except that we for-
got the old photograph of Carbine; and
there it was sittin’ on the wall beside the
Holy Family, as large as life.
“When the mothers and babies, all the
young folks, miners and prospectors from
>*ampa and Salt Lakes, came swarmin’ in,
the place was packed; men standin’ two and
three deep.
“The babies were christened: the Hehir
twins and Mat Anderson’s eldest, a Brown,
Jones and McHenry—little Williams and
Mauds”
“Michaels and Marys?”
“A Michael and Mary, as likely as not.”
“There’s always a Michael or Mary at any
christening in Faraway.”
“Every sprig of original sin started
squallin’ and yellin’ as the Reverend Tom
sprinkled and named it, so that he had to
get the people singing hymns to drown the
noise, himself bawling at the top of his
voice, and the boys joinin’ in to help him,
for all they were worth.
“After the christenings the Reverend Tom
announced that, owin’ to the indisposition
of his friend the Reverend Benjamin Spar-
row, he himself w r ould officiate at the wed-
ding. He tried to explain what had hap-
pened to the Reverend Spadger: that he
was a stranger in Faraway, and did not
know Mrs. Grundy’s Mission and Corney’s
hop beer were not what they appeared to be.
“As the rain was still coming down, the
Reverend Tom married Kitty Nancarrow and
Ed Fletcher in the bar parlor, too, and the
weddin’ guests Went on into the dining-room
for refreshments. Afterwards the boys
piled the tables and chairs to one side, and
Paddy Hehir got out his accordeon. You
know Paddy on the ’cordeon. Not a man
in the countryside to touch him. When
Paddy gets goin’ on that old windjammer of
his, your feet start dancin’ without a by-
y’r-leave. So we kept up the weddin’ till
morning. The Reverend Tom with the
best of us. Y’should have seen him dancing
with the missus here! The Reverend Tom
not as light on his feet as might be, and
Mary as crazy as a ballet dancer when the
music gets into her bones. But there was
only one corpse on the place, and that was
the Reverend Benjamin Sparrow.”
Mrs. Ryan’s little laugh fluttered again.
“After we’d bathed and bandaged his head
and put him to bed. we forgot all about him
that night,” she said. “And Mr. Sparrow
was a sick man and very sorry for himself
next morning. When I was fixing him up,
putting on a fresh bandage. I couldn’t help
apologising for having to do it on licensed
premises. ‘Don’t mention it,’ he said. ‘lt
can’t be helped, I suppose.’ ”
“But Corney’s white mare got the worst
of it,” Mick continued. “Mr. Sparrow must
have talked about Corney’s hop beer when he
got back to Coolgardie, because when Corney
built himself a new hut on the same spot and
was carryin’ on business as usual, the excise
officer paid a surprise visit one morning. A
lad who heard him inquiring what Corney
was up to these days slipped oft to warn
Corney. Corney had a barrel of hop beei
brewing at the moment, and -went for tne lick
of his life to get rid of it. Most of the stult
he emptied into a bit of a break-away near
the hut. and when there was on ]y, h , o P? lett
at the bottom of the barrel he didn t know
what to do with them. There wasn t time
to dig a hole, or anywhere to _ stow them
away safely, so lie fed them to Ins old mare.
“If you’d seen the poor thing staggering
round, shying and sidling about, as frisky
as a two-year-old, not knowing what to
make of herself, while the excise man
turned Corney’s place upside down for What
she had put away! After a bit she fell down
and went to sleep, lying stretched out there
in the sun. But the excise didn’t get any-
thing out of Corney.”
Pipes glowed in the dusk. A rumble of
laughter and gusty exclamations flowed into
WHILE THERE’S LIFE THERE’S

the silence. Stark and gigantic, the old gum
out in the road before us clutched at the
stars, great arms flung to the wild hills,
the wide bare plains and Ryan’s, where
Mick, Mary and the rest of us sat yarning.
Year-end.
EVEN last year I sang of the to-morrow;
To-night I sing only of yesterday.
And in that tune there is no hint of sorrow,
For yesterday was gay.
I have grown wise and know that from
to-morrow
(Will no prayer turn the creeping thing
away?)
Heartache and disappointment we may
borrow;
But yesterday was gay.
A laugh breaks sudden as from a bow,
An arrow twangs athwart a leaf-flecked
way,
At an .old thought that yesterday and I
know —
Oh, yesterday was gay!
Come, little songs that had no rhyme or
reason,
But lit like candles the gone yesterday.
Blowing impudently in and out of season,
Sing onc.e again your lay!
Ah! you are set to keep wake with the
sorrow
That like a bier holds my still-born to-day.
To-day was once my eager-sung to-morrow —
But yesterday was gay!

NORA MGAULIFFE.


CLINCHER.
BY F.D.DAVISON.
CLINCHER was one of those blue-
speclded heelers used for tailing stock
in the cattle country. He was a smart
little dog, and noticeable in appearance—
the sort one has in mind when praising the
breed. A one-man dog, the property of a
one-dog man, who loved him' like a son.
Scotty Craig was a grizzle-haired, leather-
skinned old bachelor bushman.. A bad bout
of rheumatism, following a trip with stock
through nor’-west Queensland in a wet
season, had closed his wandering. He was
settled now on a twenty-five-hundred acre
pear lease in the Maranoa. It was mostly
rough country, but there were a few hun-
dred acres of clean box flats and ironbark
ridges which he had ringbarked, and which
carried a good stand of blue and star grasses.
He ran about a hundred head of cattle., and
half a dozen horses. '
He was a lonelier man than he knew.
Throughout his life chance had prevented
him forming ties which it was in his nature
to cherish. Then into the settled, solitary
domesticity of his later years came Clincher;
and on Clincher he bestowed his affection.
It was not a doting affection. The dog felt
the restraints of discipline, and, because he
was unfailingly obedient to them, Scotty’s
regard was increased tenfold. Living in a
world of bush, cattle and horses dominated
by Scotty, Clincher regarded the man as
earth’s overlord, and was happy in feeling
himself the friend of the Boss of Creation.
Scotty was wont to indulge in a little
harmless boasting about Clincher. Not that
he went out of his way to do it, but if the
talk turned to dogs his contribution was
particular rather than general.
“I never have to run the horses in my-
self,” he’d say. “As soon as that fellow
sees me pull my ’lastic-sides on he knows
I’m going riding. I drop the rails of the
yard and away he goes! (You know my
horse paddock—cuts across the creek and
follows the ridge up on one side. There’s
a patch of scrubby sandalwood in the far
corner.) In less than no time he’s bringing
the mokes down through the timber. And
not full lick either. Just a nice easy trot,
with him holding back to give them a
chance at the creek crossing; and the same
coming along the wing of the yard, so
none of ’em get hipped coming through the
gate.”
Scotty’s little recitals were listened to
with good grace; partly because Clincher
had more than a home-paddock reputation
and partly from a desire to be civil towards
a man whom everybody knew as a “decent
old bloke.”
The ill-disposed could bring a shadow to
Scotty’s face by asking if Clincher would
mind anything given him
to guard. The allusion
had reference. to an occa-
sion when Scotty, under
the influence of a weak-
ness that troubled him
now and then, had
thrown his hat and coat
down in the bush and
ordered Clincher to mind
them. Two days later,
returning painfully to
his sober senses, he had
remembered the dog. He
found him waiting by the
clothes, weak and fam-
ished, and pathetically
glad to see him. In his shame, and with
some idea of atoning for a wrong that had
been done, Scotty unwisely told the story
to a neighbor. It was remembered in the
district more as evidence of a tender con-
science than as proof of culpable cruelty,
and was referred to only by the meaner
sort.
It was Scotty’s habit to ride into the
railway every Saturday afternoon to pick
up the mail and make small purchases. He
got Joe Forster’s mail at the same time and
delivered it on the way home. This was a
standing custom. Scotty’s was one of those
natures which get pleasure out of doing
obliging acts. But recently a small diffi-
culty had arisen. Joe, who was a tall,
pudgy, fair-haired man, had been looking
around for a dog for some time, and at
length had found one. Naturally the
animal’s good qualities were enhanced in
liis eyes as soon as he became its owner. He
bought it on a Tuesday, and for the rest of
the week looked forward to Saturday, when
he would exhibit it to Scotty. He felt lie
could depend on Scotty to be duly apprecia-
tive; and he felt also—although, of course,
he would not give utterance to the thought—
that Scotty would see there was at least
one dog in the world as good as his own.
Saturday came, and with it Scotty and
Clincher. Scotty dismounted, and, like the
good fellow he was, immediatelv noted and
admired Joe’s dog. Much gratified, Joe
insisted on Scotty coming into the humpy
for a drink of tea.
They had no sooner seated themselves
than sounds of a dog fight came from behind
the building. Both men made as if to rise,
but remembered themselves. (You don’t
separate fighting dogs in the bush. You let
’em settle it between themselves.)
“I saw Harry Nethersole in at the rail-
way,” said Scotty, with one ear cocked
towards the fight raging outside.
“Did you?” said Joe, with' as much show
of interest as he could muster, while won-
dering whether that yelp of agony came
from his dog or Scotty’s.
“Yes, he was telling me the Gover’ment’s
going to put down a bore on Horse Creek.”
“Oh, is it? Help yourself to the sugar.”
There was a short silence while both
men tried to think of something to say.
“Having a bit of a box-on out there,”
said Joe with what lie hoped would pass for
a grin of friendly amusement.
“The Pony Hills crowd are talking of
getting up picnic races,” said Scotty, who
was the better dissimulator of the two.
The battle had worked its way around
from the back to the side of the humpy and
was still moving. Both, men’s eyes were
on the doorway.
“When are they thinking of having it?”
asked Joe.
The dust of conflict was by now drifting
across the line of vision. At any moment
the combatants would come tumbling into
view.
Scotty had to make a strong effort to get
his mind off those two dogs long enough to
remember the proposed date. He said
“July,” abruptly, and at that moment the
battle came in sight and to an end simul-
taneously. Joe’s new dog was underneath,
with his legs in the air, and Clincher, strad-
dling him, was snarling an invitation to
get up and fight some more.
Scotty shouted at him and he moved off.
For the short remainder of Scotty’s visit
the two dogs could be heard growling at
each other across the yard.
Later, Joe watched his visitors departing
down the track. He saw Scotty lean in
the saddle, and he saw Clincher jump up
towards his stirrup. He knew Scotty was
praising him for his victory. Joe looked
at Clincher. He decided that even as a
man can express something by the set of
his shoulders, so can a dog by the set of
Ins tail.
ENTOMOLOGY.
“Would you like a wasp waist when you grow up?”
“No, I think I’d rather keep mine like a beetle’s.”
Joe was a simple-minded chap and it hurt
him greatly that on subsequent Saturdays
he had to tie his dog up to avoid the
ignominy of defeat. At the end of about
a month, when the memory of the drubbing
had worn a little thin, he left his dog run-
ning loose. He told himself that perhaps
the first fight was not really conclusive.
Perhaps Clincher had taken an advantage.
The second fight was a complete disaster
for Joe’s dog. He had to be rescued, and
Scotty’s parting advice, “You ought to keep
that dog out of the way,” sounded like a
rebuke. Joe was not sure it wasn t an
impertinence on Scotty’s part. He spent
a miserable evening.
It says something for Joe’s character that
he was not guilty of any unkindness to his
dog. And something for his extreme sensi-
tiveness that he gave the dog away.
The matter lapsed and was apparently
forgotten. Joe went to Toowoomba to visit
some relatives. While there he was offered
the gift of an Alsatian. He arrived back
with it in leash. It was the first ever seen
in that part of the bush.
The Alsatian was lying in the dust out-
side Joe’s humpy when Scotty and his two
animals came up the track the following
Saturday. He had heard the clatter of the
sliprails and was watching the track with
the alertness of his breed. Scotty, from his
elevation on the horse, was the first to see
him, and at the sight the man’s eyes went
as round as half-pennies. The horse saw
him next ; he pricked his ears and snorted.
The Alsatian stood up, and Clincher saw
him. From his behavior, Clincher might
have suddenly been confronted with the
ghost of his primeval ancestors. He
stopped dead in his tracks, the hair on the
back of his neck bristled and a growl came
from deep in his throat. He recovered him-
self and trotted along beside the horse; but
his steps were tense and mincing, and his
eye wary.
The Alsatian gave a single “Woof!’ The
noise brought Joe to the door. _ With the
aspect of a man who is acting in the nick
of time, he walked quickly out and seized
the dog with both hands by the scruff of
the neck.
“It’s all right,” he said as Scotty came
up. “I just thought it best to catch hold
of him. I wouldn’t like your dog to get
hurt!”
Not certain whether Joe was joking or
serious, Scotty kept a grave face. If Joe
was joking, he was going to be nettled; if
Joe was serious, he was prepared to de-
fend Clincher with anything he could lay
hands on.
Joe slowly released his hold. “Now,
then,” he said, addressing the big dog very
sternly—“now, then, be quiet.” He turned
toward Scotty. “I think it will be all
right,” he said.
Just then both dogs growled and took
a step toward each other. Joe whirled
round and clutched the Alsatian. “I think
you’d better be careful,” he said warningly.
Then, at the sight of the other’s face,-enjoy-
ment of the joke he was having got the
better of him. He commenced to laugh.
Joe’s reactions to pain or pleasure were
of the unrestrained kind. His guffaws put
two crows on the other side of the clearing
to uneasy flight. Chuckling and shaking
and turning to look at Scotty’s face, he
dragged the big dog over to the corner of
the yard and tied him up.
Still in doubt about the Alsatian, Scotty’s
face was inscrutable. He eyed him with a
calculating and unfriendly glance, and with-
out a word handed Joe his mail. Then he
swung into the saddle and moved off.
“Thanks, Scotty. So-long,” called Joe.
Scotty’s reply was a mumble; whereat
Joe had to lean against the humpy to sup-
port his mirth-shaken frame.
On the following Saturday Scotty did not
call at Joe’s. He stopped at the sliprails
and put the mail on top of the strainer
with a stone to weight it down, and then
went on. A gesture implying indignation
was what he intended, but he knew, and
was aware that Joe would know,, that there
was a tincture of discretion in it. And that
rankled..
Scotty’s misfortune, in common with all
men who live alone, was that his mind had
too much time to. dwell on trifles. During
the week the matter of Joe and his dog
was rarely out of his thoughts. It began
to obscure other things. His heart was.
filled with tenderness toward his incompar-
able Clincher. He called the dog to him,
stroked his sleek blue-black head and spoke
to him with loving profanity. Clincher, un-
troubled by memory and without foreboding
of the future, completely happy in the
present affection of his boss, spoke back to
him with soft whining and licked his hands
with a warm red ribbon of tongue.
Scotty brooded so much over the affair and
worked himself into such a state of mind
that in the middle of one meal he com-
menced an altercation with an imaginary
Joe.
“Clincher’s a better little dog than any
two of them damn” he began, then
recovered himself and went on with his food.
The next time he went to the railway
he left Clincher at home, tied up. He wanted
another look at that Alsatian. Perhaps it
was not as big as he had thought.
Joe, who had had his joke, and should
have known better, did his best to provoke
Scotty further. He noted Clincher’s absence
and looked around for him in feigned sur-
prise. He stood on tiptoe and peered down
the track. He even stooped and pretended
to look under the horse.
Unsmiling, Scotty handed him his mail
and turned wordlessly away. That Alsatian
was certainly a big dog—twice Clincher’s
size. But Clincher was worth a dozen of
him. It only showed what a fool Joe was
to bring a useless thing like that into the
country.
As he rode home Scotty decided to be
a man of sense. He would not allow him-
self to be upset by the antics of a clown.
He would dismiss the matter from his
h'oughts and, furthermore, would avoid Joe
m future. Joe could get his own mail. The
only way with a fellow like Forster was to
be superior to him.
Temporarily, Scotty felt better. But he
could no more get away from the topic than
a dog can tear itself from a goanna up a
lapling. Frdm feeling superior he lapsed
mto contemplating the provocation he had
suffered; then he forgot his superiority and
was in two minds about going back to
punch Joe on the nose.
Af that moment, unknown to Scotty, Joe
was wishing he had foregone the opportun-
ity to push the joke to a point where it
hurt. Scotty was a good sort. Joe wished
instead of aggravating him he had said a
word or two to smooth him down a bit.
A joke isn’t much of a joke unless the other
fellow can come in and enjoy the end of it.
Scotty did not wait for the end of the
week to go into the railway. He went on
Friday. He did not return on Saturday ;
but on Sunday morning, Joe, who was
mounting a grindstone in the shade of the
myall that grew in a corner of the yard,
heard the sliprails let down. He looked up
and saw Scotty ride through them and
come on up the track without putting them
up after him. Something was wrong.
Clincher was with him. Scotty was hat-
less and his hair was on end.
He rode into the yard and dismounted.
Without greeting he stood looking about
him, his unshaven lips parted in a nasty grin.
The Alsatian, which had been dozing
behind the humpy, came trotting into view.
At sight of the visitors he emitted a threat-
ening growl, which was repeated in a smaller
way by Clincher. Scotty grunted. The
two dogs began circling around each other,
growling distnistfully, each uncertain
whether the other intended peace or war.
“Better not!” cried Joe, his voice rising
to an excited squeak, as he saw what
Scotty’s errand was.
“You go to Hell!” Scotty flashed a blood-
shot glance at him. Scotty when the booze
had a grip of him was a different man from
the rather gentle old fellow of ordinary
times. He hissed at Clincher.
Nothing loth, the little blue dog closed to
the attack and in a flash the two were at
grips, tumbling and growling in the dust.
It was suicide for Clincher. He came _of
a breed that joins battle without counting
the odds, and being in asks no quarter.
Great qualities! But the other fellow was
a fighter, too, and had the cruel advantages
of weight and height.
Clincher came out of the first skirmish
with a piece of his hide hanging like a red
ear from one shoulder. From his demeanor
it was plain to see he knew lie was in
deep—this was no casual dust-up. His back
was against the wall. Joe made an ineffec-
tual attempt to whistle the two of them
apart. The Alsatian paid no heed. Habit
of training made Clincher look round, but
the mists of the primitive enveloped him.
He turned again to the enemy.
In a tumble, in the second skirmish, he
gripped the Alsatian by a hind leg. It was
an advantage quickly taken, and in the best
heeler tradition. A painful hold, but not
such as to cripple his adversary. The Alsa-
tian whipped round like an alligator. He
gripped Clincher by the throat, and tore
him loose from his hold. He reared up
on his hind legs and shook him like a
rabbit. He brought him to the ground and
would have worried him; but Joe had seized
a swingle-bar and with it drove him off.
Clincher struggled to his feet. The blood
came from his punctured throat in little
bubbling jets. He was as good as dead;
and knew it. He crawled a couple of paces,
and then, with a little whine, lay down.
Like a man waking from a dream, Scotty
walked across, squatted by Clincher and put
his hand on him. Clincher wagged his tail
faintly and tried to lick the hand. Within
a few moments he twitched and was dead.
Joe stood looking at the stooped man.
At length Scotty rose. The drink was
gone from him. His face was grey and full
of pain. '
“Now you and me’ll have a go!” he said.
Joe put up his fists. He knew that
Scotty was not fighting him. He was fight-
ing the moment when the full weight of
what h'e had done would descend on him.
Neither of them could fight; but they
slogged each other around the yard, pant-
ing and stumbling. An occasional grunt
marked the impact of a blow, and the dust
rose from their scuffling feet. Once Joe
tripped and nearly fell over the body of
the dead dog.
After a few minutes the purposelessness
of it came to Scotty. His hands dropped to
his side. Joe’s did likewise —but warily.
Scotty hesitated, then turned and went
across to his horse. He picked up the reins
and led the horse to where Clincher was
lying; and Joe followed^
Scotty stooped as if to pick up the dog.
“Are you going to take him home?”
“Yes”
“Wait a minute, and I’ll get you a bag.”
Joe hurried off and returned with a large
chaffbag. The eyes of the two men met
for a moment and Joe saw guilt and re-
morse in Scotty’s face.
Together they rolled the still warm and
soft body in the bag. Scotty mounted and
Joe handed the bundle up to him.
“I’ll go along and put the sliprails up
after you. It’ll save you getting down,”
said Joe. , _
They went down the track together. From
the tail of his eye as he walked beside the
horse, Joe could see the bag bobbing with
the horse’s stride. He hurried his pace
for a step or two.
Scotty passed through the rails and then
halted, but did not turn around.
“So long, Joe,” he said.
“So long, Scotty.”
Then Scotty moved off.
Joe slowly put up the rails. He stood
for a moment looking along the track at the
diminishing figure of Scotty, stooped a little
over the thing that lay across hi* knees.
Then lie turned and walked toward his
humpy, not very happy in his mind over
his share in what had happened.

SAVE AND PROFIT
Piling shillings one upon another may be a form of thrift, but it is a
risky method—and unprofitable. There is loss of profit because the
same money, placed in a Commonwealth Savings Bank, would earn
interest. There is risk of loss by fire, by burglary, even by inadvertence,
and, not so obvious but quite definite, there is the risk of temptation
to spend.
The Savings Bank Account is the logical place for your savings, for
there they both accumulate and earn interest. Thus your saving power
is multiplied, your savings become profitable, and you are less tempted
to spend wastefully.

Deekay”: Investigating the photographic
properties of lightning, concerning which
some fantastic stories are current, I have
come across one well-authenticated Austra-
lian instance. A boy. named William Moore
was killed by lightning at Bendigo. While Dr.
Iveiran was making a post-mortem examina-
tion, he observed on the chest the dis-
tinct tracing of a small tree, with trunk,
branches and leaves complete. The image
was inverted, trunk being uppermost and
branches extending downwards. A Dr.
NO TACT ABOUT THEM AT ALL.
BRUMMY: “I don’t ’old with carryin’ a lookin’-glass. They make yer face look so

Pounds made a pencil sketch of the tree as
it appeared on the body, and went to the
place where, the boy had been killed—it was on
slightly rising ground behind the Catherine
Reef Hotel, He. found there a young tree
growing at the sidp of the pathway which
tallied exactly with the sketch. Can any
member of the Council offer a scientific
explanation V

“Wynne”: “Beta's” par. (B. 23/11/’32)
reminds me of another case in which Muscovy
ducks were a temptation to lawlessness. I
called at a builder friend’s home to consult
him about a contract and encountered him
a little way from the house, apparently
deeply engrossed in the evening paper, and
casually shooing along a pair of ducks. I
walked along with him, assisting to shepherd
the Muscovies, until we all entered his back
gate. Then with startling rapidity, and no
waste of words, my friend handed me the
newspaper, seized a duck in each hand, wrung
their necks, and ushered me and the victims
into the presence of his wife, a Scottish lady
of unbending moral principles. “Here, Mary,”
was his greeting, “look what a fine pair of
ducks Mr. Brown has brought us!”
* * * *
.' “Murrawong”: I saw a mate for
Hamer’s” throwback ram (B. 23/11/’32)
on a western N.S.W. station a few months
ago. It was a month-old lamb, and its
unusual appearance held up work in the
shearing shed and loosed a flood of Rabel-
aisian conjecture anent its ancestry. The
dam was an average merino ewe growing a
good, medium-quality fleece with no signs
of running out, and the betting on the
identity of the male parent oscillated mainly
between goat and kangaroo. The lamb had
very long legs (especially the hind legs) ;
the head was carried erect and tapered
toward the nose like a ’roo’s, while the ears
were big and drooped like a goat’s. The
body was quite devoid of folds or wrinkles
and was covered with short, blue-grey bail-
or coarse fur—not a vestige of anything like
wool on it. The boss’s kids commandeered
it as a pet, and when the novelty wore off
in a few days forgot to feed it. It died.
“Jackaburra”: That freak ram is not a
throwback, but a sport. There is a some-
what similar case on record. In 1791 a
Massachusetts farmer was presented by one
of liis ewes with a male lamb possessing
short bandy legs and a very lpng body. As
this lamb grew up its owner noted that it
was unable, on account of its abbreviated
legs, to jump the fences, and as he con-
sidered this an asset, the freak was retained,
for breeding. Its offspring proved to be
either exactly like their sire or just ordinary
—there were no intermediates, and the freaks
bred true when mated with one another. The
breed has long since become extinct, but
had the variations proved more valuable,
there is no reason why that one mutation
should not have been the ancestor of an
infinite number of jumbucks. To take a
botanical analogy, a celandine sport pro-
duced in Heidelberg in 1590 is the ancestor
of all the cut-leaved celandines in the world
to-day.
“Avon” : “A.H.B.’s” parallel between High-
land and Maori traits (B. 7/12/’32) goes
to supplement the case made out, probably
whimsically, by the late Judge Alpers, who
in an essay “A Celt at the Antipodes” traces
the many points qf resemblance between the
Maoris and the Irish. Alpers found the
wake over the dead re-
produced in the tangi,
the banshee echoed in
the cry of the taniwha
(wood devil), and as
much blarney in the
speech of the Maori as
is inherent in that of
a native of Tipperary.
The politeness and
good manners of the
Maori, too, Alpers
points out, are Irish,
and so is their happy-
go-luckiness. To clinch
the comparison, he
quotes, on the autho-
rity of Sir George
Grey, a Maori legend
of how dog-stealing
was ended. A dog had
been stolen and a
great tohunga as-
sembled the people and
commanded the dog to
howl in the belly of
the thief. It howled,
and the wicked chief
who stole it was pun-
ished. Substituting
pig for dog and St.
Patrick for the
tohunga, the whole
story is told with re-
markable similarity of
detail in Caxton’s
“Golden .Legend.” It
may be added that
samples of Maori
humdr enshrined on
this page in the last
ha,f-century contain a
large sprinkling of
bulls. Whether the
Maori derives from the
Northern Hemisphere
or not, he certainly is a Celt in temperament.
And as the northern Celts had their origin
in Asia, there’s at least a sporting chance
that the antipodean race sprang from the
same locality.

“Smoky Bill”: Old Peter, the boundary-
rider, was given a new horse one morning,
but turnqd her down on the score that she
bolted. “Well,” said the overseer, “you
ought to be able to ride her, as you have
been all your life in the bush!” “’Aven’t
been all me life in the bush.” said Peter; “I
never got on an ’orse till ’82!”

“Matanzas” : “Coir” (B. 2/11/’32) is off
the mark in describing the contents of the
green coooanut as “the
most insipid drink
known to humanity.”
It is one of the ccm-
mon e s t and most
healthful drinks of
practically every town
in Cuba. There the
bars are fitted with a
serving device consist-
ing of a short hollow
pipe with a jagged
upper edge, against
which the eye of the
green cocoanut is
pressed and rotated
so that the discharged
fluid passes down the
pipe into the tumbler,
which is held under-
neath. These green
cocoanuts are kept in
an ice-chest, and there
is a huge demand for
their liquid contents.
Besides being an effi-
cient thirst-quencher,
the juice is considered
to have definite diu-
retic properties, even
without a “dash.”
The beverage men-
tioned must not be
confused with the
sickly sweet “milk” of
the r'pe cocoanut.
“Nakhoda”: Judging by its report to the
League of Nations, our Administration in
New Guinea has much the same outlook as
the early missionaries to the heathen. In the
Administration’s report the phrase “un-
sophisticated natives” occurs several times,
although the deeper one digs into the culture
of primitive people the more sophisticated
they seem. There were more taboos, rules
and regulations governing conduct amongst
Australian aboriginals than amongst civilised
folk. Their life was by no means simple.
One of the problems presented to the New
Guinea police concerned four natives who
professed to have been miraculously born,
to have supernatural powers superior to the
district officer and to be able to make crops
grow at will. They advised the natives to
destroy their cooking pots and offered to
produce by magic a continuous supply of
provender. In Borneo wealth is measured
by the possession of supposedly magical pots,

THOMAS HENRY: “My old ’o Oman she do spend hours tellin’

actually ancient importations from China.
As much as £5OO may be paid for particular
specimens whose intrinsic value is a handful
of dollars. Some of the pots are used to
store rice in and the supply of rice is
believed never to diminish, however much
is taken out of them. Some tribes buried
their dead in them and hung the pots from
the family rooftree. After a year or so,
when the cadaver had deliquesced into a
clear liquid, a hole was bored in the bottom
of the jar and the family drank the fluid,
believing that they thus absorbed the martial
virtues of their ancestors.

“Scolopax”: The godwit is not the only
bird to pay this side of the world annual
visits from Siberia (B. 30/11/’32). The
common snipe is another, and he, too, comes
south for a season after marrying and bring-
ing up a family in Bolsliieland. The snipe
seems to make his way south through the
Malayan archipelago and New Guinea.
Writer has shot them in northern Papua,
where they annually arrived about the
beginning of January. They seemed to
stay a few days and then disappeared, to be
seen no more until the return journey. The
case of the snipe is peculiar in that he is
not a long-distance flyer in the ordinary
course of things, as most shooting men can
testify. The godwit’s performance is easier
to understand. He is a fast, straight goer,
not an aerial acrobat, like the snipe.
* ❖ ❖ *
“F.Y.7”: Queensland pastoralists arc
hoping that a natural means of coping with
the rabbit pest has been discovered. ' Bunnies
in the south-west have been dying in thou-
sands, examination showing that they were
infested with a red flea which was the
apparent cause of death. The State Animal
Health Station has taken the matter up and
experiments are being made with rabbits and
fleas at Yeerongpilly. It has been noted that
in very dry seasons rabbits are apt to be
peculiarly susceptible to ticks and other
infestations, the mortality curve dropping
with the coming of rain and grass. If the
flea proves as efficacious in good seasons as
it seems to have been in bad, there will be
something to rejoice about.
* * * *
“Crusty”: Some recent Abo. comments on
the willingness for stoush often exhibited
by the supposedly timid kangaroo have been
endorsed by a couple of happenings in
N.S.W. One of the polo-playing Rosses, of
Harden, bailed up an old man in a fence
corner and was charged by the brute. It
took some battling to get the better of him,
since it was not desired to kill. Ross
was mounted on one of his polo ponies and
it was to the nag that the hopper paid most
attention. About the same time an out-
back mailman in a motor-car met a kangaroo
on a fenced road and slowed down to avoid
running over it. The beast thereupon waded
into the car, and tore off the. side curtains
before beating a retreat.
“SAN FAIRY ANN.”
(Sans faire rien.)
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
"San Fairy Ann,” we used to say
In France, in years long lost an’ gone,
When buckshee trouble came our way
An’ life an’ luck seemed none too "bon.”
From brigadier to babblin’ brook
The terse, sardonic catch-phrase ran
Adown the ranks when things were crook:
“San Fairy Ann!” “San Fairy Ann!”
An’ buttock-deep in frosted mud,
Or sweltering ’neath August suns,
Or splathered by the brains and blood
Of men who died that still the guns
Might bay from “Wipers” to the sea
Their challenge to the Alleyman,
We found a subtle sorcery
In those three words—“ San Fairy Ann.”
A subtle sorcery, an’ more:
The guts to grin an’ damn the odds
An’ carry on, the guts that bore
The berserk scourgings of the gods
Half scornfully, the guts that made
A fellow proud to be a man ;
Broken, an’ lonely, an’ afraid,
But skiting still—“ San Fairy Ann!”
Digger! if “No Bon Alley” or
Queer Street now features your abode,
Look not to man for succor, nor
Pester the gods to ease your load.
You’ll find ’em deaf, an’ dumb, an’ blind
(’Twas ever thus since time began),
But in the end you’ll also find
It’s no great odds —“San Fairy Ann.”

WHEN LIVING WAS CHEAP
YEARS ago, when living was cheap, many men assured them-
selves for sums that seemed adequate—then! To-day
those sums are quite insufficient. The cost of living has doubled
itself. Amounts that would have kept your dependents years
ago would mean penury to-day. Protect your dependents
to-day as you did years ago. Increase your policy to meet the
new conditions of to-day and to-morrow.

“Wen”: Shade is at a premium in many
parts of north-west N. S. Wales, and sheep
have to take what they can get. On the Dol-
gelly Plain, near Moree, they majr be seen at
noonday sitting under the telephone lines,
taking advantage of the vei’y meagre shadow
thrown by the wires. A pad parallel with
the line shows that they make the most of
the same sparse shade when travelling over
the plains in the heat of summer.

“C.Q.”: According to the Vic. State ento-
mologist, this is going to be a bad season
for blowflies, an epidemic being due; and
the crew of the German freighter Main is
inclined to agree with him. When that
vessel was 10 miles out at sea between
Melbourne and Adelaide a prodigious swarm
of the pests descended on her. All hands
were piped on deck, but it was five hours
before the plague was vanquished, and then
it w T as the darkness that did it. In the
meantime, nobody could sleep and cooking
had to be suspended. The heat-wave in
Adelaide is said to have been responsible.

“Gumblegubbin”: If the Nawab of Pat-
audi wants to do some big-game hunting
without getting lost he can be
assured of plenty of it among the
wild pigs on the plains between
Warren and Walgett. The
grunters have been a pest for
years, and large sums have been
paid on some stations for scalps.
The war is mainly carried on
with rifles, guns and lances.
Most of the tuskers are lean,
wiry and long-snouted, but they
are swift and savage, and charge
with the ferocity of the primor-
dial hog when hotly pressed. The
lance is a shear blade fastened
to the end of a long stick. Jab-
bing a running pig in the right
place with it is something like
polo-playing. On an open plain
the pig hasn’t much chance
against practised horsemen; but
when a hunter is unhorsed, as
sometimes happens, a treeless plain is not
the best place for him.

“Plankton”: Most spiders find it neces-
sary to work for a living, but a Javanese
member of the tribe, rejoicing in the name
of Phyrnarachne descipiens (euphonistically
suggesting that of a Gaelic pipe-tune) has
solved the problem of living easily and well
by substituting art for energy. This crea-
ture, after spinning a small w r hite hammock
across a broad leaf, simply lies down on its
back in the middle with legs folded over
its bingie, and waits for a meal to arrive.
In this position the spider, surrounded by
the web, bears a remarkable resemblance to
a drop of bird excrement. Presently, per-
haps, a small “skipper” butterfly comes along
and alights on the camouflaged schemer.
That is the end of the story—and the
butterfly.
* * * *
“Nakhoda”: In the absence of particulars
it is difficult to say what was the breed of
the monkey which took a two-year-old baby
out of a cradle in a Delhi residence, retired
to the top of a tree with his capture, and
there fondled it until bribed to come down by
a dish of delicacies. The cocoanut monkey,
which is trained to climb trees and pick the
ripe fruit, might perform the feat if the
baby was sufficiently under-nourished. As for
the fondling, monkeys seem to share most
human instincts. A somewhat repulsive spec-
tacle was the reciprocal affection displayed
by a married woman and a large waw-waw
at the Seaview Hotel in Singapore when I
stayed there. She used to parade the lawn,
with her uncanny companion, to the discom-
fort of afternoon tea-drinkers. There are
many circumstantial stories of orang-outans
stealing native women current in Borneo.
A Dyak told me of a case where the sexes
were reversed, a female orang kidnapping
a man who, having lost his wife and children,
was wandering disconsolately in the forest.
According’ to the story he resigned himself
to residence at the top of a tall tree and
lived With his captor for a .year, during
which she fed him generously and eventually
bore him a male child. A passing canoe full
of fellow-villagers filled him with nostalgia
and, tying his clothes together, he succeeded
in reaching the ground and escaping. The
lady returned unexpectedly and. perceiving
what was happening, took their offspring and
tore him in twain in full view of its father.

“Coir”: “Millimurra” (B. 30/11/’32) says
he wants to join issue with me over some
remarks about the West African oil palm.
Those remarks dealt solely with the confusing
by a daily paper of the oil and cocoanut
palms and their produce and made no refer-
ence whatever to the edible qualities of the
oil nut, so his extolling of palm oil “chop”
and the recipe therefore is malapropos. As
to the making of intoxicating drink from the
THE CONCEIT OF THE SEX.
MRS ORPINGTON: “Listen to him! Anyone would think he hatched em.
palm kernel tree by natives, the practice is
universal from India to the far South Seas,
many varieties of palm, including the cocoa-
nut, being drawn upon for the hootch.
Indeed, in the early days of Australian settle-
ment our own cabbage-tree palm supplied
not only material for making hats, but the
wherewithal for raising a prime crop of
fantods.

“Trautsdet” : A plaintive little squeak drew
my attention. I investigated with a light
and found a large green frog endeavoring
to swallow a half-grown mouse, alive, tail
first. He was pushing the mouse down his
throat with his hands pressed on the mouse’s
nose. The swallowing process was completed
in 15 minutes and after it the frog seemed
quite exhausted, for he couldn’t move. This
morning I found the dead mouse disgorged,
partly digested.

“Tructa”: Another attempt is to be made
to acclimatise rainbow trout in the Queens-
land coastal district about Brisbane. The
first release will be in the Pine River. Some
years ago trout were released in the Con-
damine, on the Darling Downs, and in other
streams in this locality. According to the
authorities they will live and grow in
Queensland, but will not breed, as they only
do this in running water, and the majority
of Queensland streams are sluggish'. It may
be so; still, the rainbow flourishes and
breeds in reservoirs and landlocked lakes, in
Maoriland and elsewhere. In Vic. rivers,
which can justly be described as sluggish,
Salmo fario increases naturally and abun-
dantly,

“Strict Veg.”: The small boy is a great
perpetuator of popular superstitions. My
infant, aged 10, bought a pigeon from a
friend, but it escaped and returned to its
previous owner. On recovering it my boy
dipped its head in water and then released
it. I asked him for an explanation. He said,
“Oh, that makes it forget where it came
from.” I remembered doing the same thing
40 years ago.

“Venturino”: Re “Waukaroo’s” par (B.
23/11/’32), I can call to mind the 1916
mouse plague in the Mallala (S.A.) district.
It was quite a common thing to catch three
mice at once in a penny trap. Once I got
four, one, lying alongside, having been
knocked cold by the spring. But having
watched them I can say definitely it was the
concerted rush and not the combined pull
that did it. That was a plague! Every
curtain you shook would release half a dozen
mice. They spoiled wheatstacks, and chewed
up a storekeeper’s stock, even to lead pencils,
while in our house they demolished a tube
of seccotine, tube and all. One morning our
cat had 37 laid out as an example to her
kittens, and one farmer poisoned 7000 in
one night. A skin plague killed them off at
last.
* * * *
“Lingo”: “Trevdee’s” “butcherese” (B.
7/12/’32) has a parallel in the “erbo” lingo,
which is quite common among the younger
fry in Sydney suburbs. The rule in this
case is to insert “erb” before each vowel,
except when two vowels are together, in
which case the first vowel only takes the
“erb” before it. Thus “Erbausserbie werbill
werbin therbe erbasherbes” is translated
‘ Aussie will win the ashes.” As regards
quickness in back-chat I would match any
two “erbo” exponents against “Trevdee’s”
meatmen.
* * * *
“L’Fou”: As “Mu.ndowie” says (B.
9/11/’32), it takes a little experimenting
to find the conditions most congenial to
native plants. Overfeeding is probably the
most common mistake. After generations
of hardy living many wildings simply can-
not stand this. I have seen a splendid wall
of purple sarsaparilla ( Hardeniergia)
crumple up and wilt off in a few wpeks. A
post-mortem revealed that a neighbor on the
other side of the fence had been forking
in stable manure for his roses. Shade about
the roots is also resented by many flowering
shrubs. I have known scarlet gums to turn
sulky and go on a flower strike when a
living mulch of ivy geraniums was provided.
When the earth was left baked and bare
they broke into a perfect riot of bloom.
Some of the wild beauties of the JMallee
are never happier than when they are
annually half submerged—as with a sand
drift. But best conditions for growth do
not always give heavy blossoming. When
plant life is threatened, there is often a
despei’ate and untimely effort at reproduc-
tion. Thus a starved plant wall run. to seed
earlier, and (allowing for stunted develop-
ment) may be relatively more prolific than
normal.

“H. 8.” (Vancouver) : A Bulletin par.
about a find of gold in the streets of Menzies
(W.A.) reminds me. In the early days of
the township I had a lot on the main street,
next the hotel that Gregory (now M.H.R.)
helped to run. As times were quiet I used
to go out prospecting, accompanied by Camp-
bell, who was waiting for goods to arrive for
Walsh’s store. One morning I could not go
and Campbell prospected alone. When I went
down to the store next day to ask how he
got on, he took from under the counter a
can containing a piece of quartz veined with
about an ounce of gold. He said that at
lunch time, while picking up a few sticks
for a fire, he noticed a rock showing just
above the surface. He got his pick and
napped off the piece he produced to me.- His
first impulse was to stake the spot, but he
reflected that the goods for the store might
arrive any day and he would have to be
there to receive them. If anyone came along
and saw new stakes they would start nap-
ping on the outcrop, so he decided to leave
no trace of the showing. He was so careful
to hide his tracks that he trailed some
bushes after him as he walked out to the
road. The first Sunday after the goods for
the store had arrived we plodded out to
stake claims. Many times afterwards we
made the same pilgrimage, but we never
found the place.

“Jeviel”: “Sli'ep” asks where pigeons
were used in the Great War (B. 30/11/’32).
Seaplane and airship patrols over the North
Sea found them useful in the event of the
failure of wireless, or of forced landings,
and for secret operation messages. A Blue
Chequer hen was released at 4 p.m. from
a Short seaplane forced down 22 miles
from its base. The bird homed at 4.22
p.m., and a fast motor-launch did the rest.
When a submarine-spotting D.H.4 pancaked
on the water through engine failure, a
pigeon brought the news and a destroyer
was directed to the spot. It picked up the
pilot after he had spent an hour in the
water, the ’plane having sunk 15 minutes
after landing. A third instance is that of
an R.A.N.S. seaplane that hit the North
Sea in flames after a low-altitude dog-fight
with five of the opposition, 30 miles n.-w.
of Ostend. One of its pigeons got through
to the base, and three of the crew were
saved after being in the water for 45
minutes. “Dogsbody’s” assertion that these
pigeons needed no training contradicts his
war-time flying experience. When allotted
to a unit the birds were trained by gradual
stages over distances of one, two, four, six
and 10 miles, after which the distance was
increased each time by 10 miles. The next
stage included releases from aerial patrols 15
to 20 miles from home, and special training
for night-flying. Successful graduates were
taken reguiarly on patrols over the lines, on
seaplane reconnaissances, and extended air-
ship flights over the North Sea.

“Mola”: Marine naturalists all the world
over will be interested in the discovery in
Queensland waters of a baby sunfish. This
was disgorged by a snapper caught in deep
water off Fraser Island and was about the
size of a florin. Considering that the adult
sunfish grows to a length—though it is
almost as broad as it is long—of 20ft. and
more, with a weight of over a ton, the size
of the youngster is surprising. Little is
known of the life history of these fishes.
They are supposed to live largely on the
larvae of the fresh-water eel, and for this
reason spend most of their time at great
depths, though their occasional practice of
basking on the surface of the sea is Well
known and gave them their popular name.

cult, also overcome the old-timer’s prejudice,
Nevertheless subdivisional rotational grass
cultivation carries with it the future of

try population would turn many of our un-

much employment to secondary industries.

FATTENING LANDS.
“Waddy Mundoie”: The day is definitely
approaching when the problem of conveying
meat in a chilled condition to Europe will
be solved—it may not be too much to claim
that the Port Fairy shipment solved it. But
that will be only the first round in the tussle
with Argentina. The problem of distance
will remain. It is unsolvable. The other
problem is that of producing the young early-
maturing beef that the market wants. Vic-
toria may be able to supply it, but the
article produced there will, in the main, be
snapped up for home consumption ; N. S.
Wales may do something in the same direc-
tion, but not so successfully as the Cabbage
Garden State. It is in Queensland, the
great cattle-producing State, that the pro-
blem is most formidable. The breeding areas
are far from the freezing works, and some
scheme must be devised for getting the bul-
locks in young from the runs on pas-
tures where they can be rapidly fattened and
moved off to the works. Energy and enter-
prise properly directed on the Darling Downs,
in the West Moreton, and on the rich riverine
areas of the Mary and Burnett watersheds
should open up a new industry for cockies
who own rich lands that are now mainly
devoted to growing more or less unprofitable
crops
So’far as N. S. Wales is concerned, it
has the valuable but entirely neglected report
of Elwood Mead, the great American agri-
culturist, to help it. He was brought back
to Australia nearly 20 years ago to consider
what larger uses could be made of the Mur-
rumbidgee irrigation areas, and he saw that
in stock-fattening they might do probably
their greatest national service.
SOWING NATIVE GRASSES.
Some of the best sheep in N. S. Wales
and other-parts of Australia are raised on
Danthonia grasses—silver-top, white-top,
fluffy-top and the like. In wet coastal areas
imported grasses are taking the place of
Danthonia, but in semi-arid country used
for wool production the family of wallaby
grasses is and will remain, all-important to
the pastoralist. The native grasses resist
drought, are palatable to stock during the
greater part of the year, and give green feed
after rain in hot summers. And. as experi-
mcnts at the Waite Institute (S.A.) have
shown, they can be established in sown pas-
tures, though grpwjh is

KIKUYU IN WESTRALIA.
“Salmon Gum”: In a table issued by the
Westralian Agricultural Department as a
guide to suitable types of pastures for
different soils, Kikuyu is mentioned as an
apparently unimportant addition to a mix-
ture. This may be justified by the depart-
ment’s experiments, but, from my own
experience, give me Kikuyu for a heavy
so il pasture.
Seven years ago a farmer I know planted
p i o ts of Kikuyu, paspalum, sub. clover and
other grasses over portion of a river flat,
a heavy clay, subjected to flooding each
winter, and to drought for three months
0 f the ’ summer. The Kikuyu is on its own
j n standing up to the conditions. It re-
mains green all summer, and all the year
round stock show a decided preference for
i t it is palatable in all stages of growth.
I have mown a crop two feet high and fed
to stock in an open paddock with no waste.
Kikuyu does not seed in Australia, and
must be planted as roots. I find the follow-
ing method speedy and satisfactory. Put
the roots through a chaffcutter, using the
larger cut, and broadcast on cultivated
ground. Then cultivate or harrow to insure
a good burying. Plant at a time when
sufficient rain falls to keep the ground moist
until the roots have shot. Its principal
growing period is in the spring, and it re-
covers quickly from a severe winter. Top-
dress with about three cwt. of super, to
the acre each vear.
‘ ■
FODDER TREES AND SHRUBS,
£ r ~, „ ~ • -native
“ Waadl : °T l mffiNnUv in
fodder trees and shrubs is diffic y
planting. Even the hardiest, d » •_
in S plants are severely ehde , f y
not wilt away and die, when sh fted and
when seed is sown it may lie dorma t a
long while before germinating. Then w e
tbe tender shoots a PP ear above giound t ey
may be eaten off by sheep, cattle and ‘
garoos or cropped off later if they escape
the infant stage. Therefore many grazieis
wont, bother with trees and shrubs; others
have been disheartened through scattering
seeds season after season and getting poor
results. But crops of any kind will be
failures if they’re not looked after and pro-
tected, and the propagation of plants tha.
will save stock when the grass and herbage
are gone is well worth the initial care that
they require.
To succeed, have a home .nursery,, and sow
the seed in tubes filled with , a mixture of
soil and black sand. Many things about the
place are suitable for tubes or pots, such
as jam- and treacle-tins, old motor tyres cut
into sections, hollow limbs of trees and card-
board rolled into a cylinder and pinned with
a bit of thin wire or a paper-fastenei. These
tubes should not be less than 6m. long Bury
them in the ground, or m a box filled with
the same composition as the tubes, to within
an inch of the top, alul keep the sou moist,
but not wet. Two seeds should be placed in
each, about half an inch deep; if both gernn-
nate, the weaker plant can be pulled out,
but if the pot is wide enough, say 3in. or
4in., both may be left in. bor quick germi-
nation, the harder seeds should be steeped
for a few minutes in hot water before sow-
ing, or the tubes covered with galvanised
iron in the sun, and uncovered at night.
Transplant the tubes before the roots
show through at the bottom —when the plant
has grown about half the length of the tube
—burying it in the ground in the same way
as at first. By this method the root is not
disturbed, and the casing in which it has
grown soon rots away. It is necessary,
however, to protect it until the main stem
is out of reach of browsing animals. Three
or four stakes cut from the top of a tree,
w'th the laterals left on, will effect this.
The waste woody stuff from lopped trees,
with their stiff spikes, is the best for the
pu, pose. When a few pots are taken out
now and again in the car or waggonette, it
is not such a formidable job as it looks, and
every batch so transported means an improve-
ment to the run. The best time for doing
this is after rain.
Whore you want trees to grow in clumps
or thick patches of shrubs —such as hopbush
and bluebush, the seed of which may be
broadcast —a lightning fence of wire and
stakes is the best protection. It can be run
round a big patch in a couple of hours and
shifted to another part later when the plants
are high enough.
QUEENSLAND’S FIVE-YEAR PLAN.
“Babb Dwyer” : Queensland is the latest to
evolve a five-year plan. It is to take the
form of systematic herd-testing, bull-regis-
tration and the like, and that is all to the
good ; but the equally important subject of
feeding should not be neglected. The tester
can only show us what the cow is producing ;
it won’t show us what she could be produc-
ing under a proper system of pasture man-
agement, rotational grazing and top-dress-
ing, with the necessary minerals and grain-
concentrate mixtures when and where neces-
sary. It behoves Queensland dairy-farmers
to do their utmost to provide a balanced
ration and improve their pastures before they
start to reproach Strawberry.
It is fashionable when referring to our
poor average butter-fat production to quote
Denmark as'a bright example of what breed-
ing and testing will do. The Danes are
great believers in rotational grazing and
balanced rations. Denmark buys cotton-seed
cake produced in Queensland. Many Queens-
land dairymen have no use for that article.
WALLOWS FOR PIGS.
“Cooramin”: Pigs don’t sweat, and their
only way of getting cool in hot weather is
to wallow in mud and water. Tncy prefer
shallow water, as in a shaded swamp.
Lacking water, they will make a wallow in
soft mud or coal sand. Shut in a dry sty,
they will root holes where they can to get
to a cooler bed to lie in.
A wallow should be provided during the
summer months. A small swamp at the
bottom of a pig run is good, but a gully
is better, as with every rain it gets a wash-
out. But it should be shaded with a tree
or two on the sunny side. Besides the bene-
ficial effect that cleanliness has on the pig’s
health, the immersion in the wallow destroys
hog lice.
Where there is no gully or other natural
provision, a wallow can be made on the
shaded side of the sty by scooping out a
hollow large enough to accommodate the
enclosed herd, and cementing the bottom and
sides. This can be filled with water, and
kept clean and fresh. Without the concrete
it soon becomes a foull bog. At some large
piggeries bathing pools are provided, 20ft.
to 30ft. long and 10ft. to 15ft. wide; in
these the pigs lie side by side for hours.
The depth should range from a few inches
at the sides to a foot or more in the centre.
A pipe at one end, at the lowest depth,
plugged with a stake, makes it easy for the
bath to be emptied and cleaned. With this
convenience the pig lias all the wallow it
needs, and can keep cool and clean.
OATS FOR OATMEAL.
“Hortus”: There is an increasing market
in Australia for oats suitable for manufac-
ture into the “rolled” or “flaked” breakfast
dish. The best all-round variety for the
purpose is Algerian. Its grain is large and
plump, and of fairly regular size. But it
has one fault —a hull too thick and long.
Buddah, Mulga and Gidgee have the defect
of bearing naked grain at the top of the
panicle. In the process of manufacture the
oats are passed over a kiln to facilitate de-
hulling, and naked grains, being scorched,
darken the finished article.
The N.S.W. Department of Agriculture
has suggested to the R.A.S. people the insti-
tution of special classes for milling oats at
the next Royal Show, the classes to be
judged by a representative of a manufac-
turing firm. This may lead to the produc-
tion of the perfect variety.
LEGUMINOUS CROPS AND NITROGEN-
OUS FERTILISERS.
“Alf Alpha”: Leguminous plants, such as
peas, beans,* lucerne and members of the
clover family, have the power of taking
nitrogen from the air and fixing it by
means of nodules on their roots. The nod-
ules, in a general sense, may be taken to
be clumps of nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Fol-
lowing this important discovery, we were
told by the scientists it was not only use-
less but wasteful to apply nitrogen to
crops of these plants, and were advised to
include a leguminous crop in the rotation,
mainly with the idea of supplying nitrogen
to succeeding crops.
In following out this practice, there are
several things to be considered. In the
first place, when a leguminous crop is grown
on a rattling good piece of rich alluvial or
volcanic soil, the amount of nitrogen fixed
mav be very small, for the activity of the
bacteria depends upon the amount of nitro-
gen available in the soil. The greater the
amount of available nitrogen present, the
less active are the bacteria; they loaf, so
to speak. On the other hand, when a
legume is grown in a poor, hungry soil the
maximum amount of nitrogen is fixed. “But
a poor, hungry soil will not grow a legu-
minous crop successfully,” you will say. The
answer is that it will, provided you use
manure liberally and do not cut out avail-
able nitrogen. I have had experience in
growing peas and beans in a rich alluvial
loam and a poor, sandy soil. The response
to a dressing of sodium nitrate in
the latter case was pronounced, and a
further similar dressing of the fertiliser re-
sulted in a 20 per cent, increase in yield
over the no-nitrogen section.
In growing legumes for yield in poor
soils, there are two points to remember —
the value of a dressing of mild lime prior
to sowing, and the need of a dressing of
available nitrogen during growth. This
procedure gives results which prove the
great importance of legumes in the rotation
of crops. This contribution must not be
misconstrued into meaning that rich soils
do not need a legume in the ei'op rotation,
or that the gain in nitrogen is negligible
in their case, but rather that the greatest
gain is obtained by practising the rotation
on poorer-class land.
SPOTTED WILT OF TOMATOES.
This disease is giving trouble to growers
in various parts of the Commonwealth. No
method of prevention has been discovered,
and spraying is useless. Mr. H. A. Pittman,
the Westralian Plant Pathologist, is of
opinion that thrips, so prevalent last year,
and to be found this season in garden flowers
and capeweed, are transmitting the disease
in Perth. He gives the following advice
to growers seeking to apply control
measures:—
1. Do not grow tomato plants near flower gardens.
2. Grow the Early Dwarf Red variety, which is
less susceptible than most of the others commonly
grown. Do not on any account grow the Dwarf
Champion, which is about the most susceptible
variety.
3. When planting out the seedlings, plant out
two or three slightly separated in each place instead
of one.
4. Pull out diseased plants as soon as they are
noticed, and destroy by burning or burying deeply.
Spotted wilt does not spread at all rapidly by
contact from diseased to healthy plants.
5. Do everything possible to keep down thrips,
such as spraying frequently with Black Leaf 40,
kerosene emulsion, or some similar material, and by
using overhead watering if possible, as the tlirip
is very much encouraged by dry atmospheric con-
ditions.
IRRIGATION-DISTRICT PROBLEMS.
“Woorinen” : Two problems that the poli-
ticians ignored when spending a mint of
money on irrigation works and settlement
were the spoiling of land by salt and the
waterlogging of subsoil. .They are now being
studied by the scientists. In Vie, and S.A.
areas, soil surveys revealed high percentages
of salt in the virgin soils; unfortunately
many men had been ruined before the sur-
veys were made. In one S.A. settlement
it is estimated that from 80,000 to 80,000
tons of salt are annually washed out of the
soil by the, irrigation waters and the under-
ground drainage system.
Now a 16-acre vineyard has been laid
out at Merbein in ground showing a very
high percentage of natural salts. Part of
this is drained by tile drains, part undrained.
Vines were planted last year and nearly 100
per cent, struck. All vine rows are laid out
so that a rapid watering is given, and all
water is measured. Examination of soil
profiles and experiments with percolation
showed that it took only six hours tp wet
this class of soil to a depth of 4ft, At all
times during the life of the vines efforts
will be made to give them only enough
water to wet the root zone; this means a
total time of irrigation in tnis class of soil
of only six hours. Studies of salt concen-
tration and analysis of the soils are made
periodically; they show that the system of
irrigation is driving the salt down into the
subsoil, below the feeding zone of the roots.
Over-irrigation of salty soil, on the other
hand, brings the salt to ‘the surface, killing
the plants.
The other angle of the problem is exhibited
on the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Areas, Here,
at 15ft., extending to 50ft., is a layer of
soil impermeable to water. Sitting on top

of this is all the irrigation water used but
not taken out of the ground by the plants.
In many cases the free water has risen to
within 3ft. of the surface. The plan now
being tried (other measures failed) provides
for removal of all free water by growing
deep-rooting plants such as lucerne or canary
grass, which can drain water from 7ft.
When the water table is reduced by this
method below the feeding zone of the roots
of orange-trees, etc, all irrigations must be
so managed as to wet only the upper two
or three feet of soil. By reducing water to
an absolute minimum, orange groves which
were fast dying out have been brought back
to life. One grower installed an overhead
spray system and, by giving waterings of
only lin. at a time, instead of the old style
of six or seven inches, has rejuvenated dying
trees.
THE I-lOGAN PLAN.
“Jack Point” : Many years ago an Ameri-
can poultry-farmer named Walter Hogan
wrote a book in which he detailed a method
of. ascertaining the laying abilities of hens.
The main points were thickness of and dis-
tance between pelvic bones and capacity, as
indicated by the space between the end of
the breastbone and pelvic bones. Hogan
claimed that his plan would enable one of
fair experience to gauge a hen’s egg-laying
ability for a year within a few eggs. He
was ridiculed unmercifully, and I sup-
pose there are few supporters of the Hogan
plan left.
Nevertheless there is a lot in what the
old chap wrote. It will generally be found
that the busy, bright-eyed bird, first off the
perch in the morning and last on at night,
has straight pelvic bones, free from hard
gristle—the presence _of gristly flesh or
curved bones when birds should be laying
is almost an infallible sign of a poor layer.
The capacity test, too, is trustworthy; if a
hen hasn’t room for assimilation of a
large amount of food she can’t produce many
eggs. The eye, however, should be first
judge in culling. No hen should be bred
from which is undersized or hasn’t the
general appearance of a layer.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
My Corriedale lambs, which are in a big
clean paddock, supplied with salt, arc suffer-
ing from what appears to be arthritis. A
number of them, aged from one to three
weeks, arc so cramped in the legs that they
can hardly move, though otherwise quite
healthy. Cause and cure? —3431.
Almost certainly arthritis, which is caused
by an organism that settles in the joints at
birth, through the unhealed umbilicus, or
through wounds caused by tailing or castra-
tion. No specific cure, but gentle exercise
in early morning and late evening has been
known to reduce mortality, as if the lamb is
disturbed it can get milk from the ewe. Best
method of prevention is to burn or bury
deeply in lime al] dead animals; and every
care should be taken to see that pastures in
which lambs are born, and yards in which
tailing, etc., is done are clean and free from
disease. Sterilise all instruments by boiling,
2nd use clean boiled water and reliable
antiseptics when tailing, and so forth. Burn
or bury tailings.
(1) How can I have my coics tested and
valued? (2) Can a dairyman in my part of
N.S.W. give milk away or sell it? —3026.
(1) Make an application to H. P. Chap-
man, senior dairy instructor, Box 12, West
Maitland. (2) It is necessary for a dairy-
man to register under the Dairies Super-
vision Act with the local authority (in your
case the police officer, Scone) in order to
produce milk for sale. Registration is not
necessary if milk is given away. If milk is
forwarded for consumption within the milk
area registration should be made under the
Milk Act, 1931, instead of the Dairies Super-
vision Act. Registration under the Milk Act
is granted by the Milk Board, Phillip-street,
Sydney.
How can I cope with a plague of white
ants? Their heaps appear after every shower
of rain until ice have 40 to 50 of them to
the acre. Have poisoned with arsenic with
no success. —27o3.
Probably you didn’t use arsenic properly.
Get a small dust-gun and blow finely-powdered
white arsenic into two or three deep punc-
tures made in each nest down towards ground
level. Plug up the holes with clay. Results
should not be expected under two to three
weeks. Alternatively, pour into a deep punc-
ture made in the top of each nest 4oz. to
Soz. of carbon bisulphide and seal up
quickly with moist clay. Make sure that
no other openings into the nest occur. Leave
for 48 hours, at the end of which time the
nest should be adequately fumigated.
(1) Is the planting of alternate rotes
of Auric, Cresioell Seedling and King
Edicard VII. strawberries advisable to
ensure proper pollination and production?
(2) What varieties do you recommend?
(3) What yield can be expected for the first
year with new plants? (4) Is it safe and
profitable to grow strawberries for the Syd-
ney market? —3265.
(1) These varieties do not require another
variety to pollinate them. (2) Creswell
and Fendelcino. As Fendelcino is an early
blossomer it requires another early blos-
somer, such as Port Macquarie, to pollinate
its early blossoms. One row of 'Port Mac-
quarie to three of Fendelcino is sufficient.
(3) All conditions being favorable, with
close planting, 640 dozen punnets per acre.
(4) The profits from strawberry-growing
are about the same as from other small
crops, such as vegetables. Last year many
of the older-established strawberry-growers
reported that the prices ruling did not pay
them.
Two of my. chicks have crossed beaks. Is
this fault serious, and can it be remedied? —
3440.
The malformation is incurable, and the
chicks should be destroyed. A fowl needs
a perfectly-formed beak to keep the little
oil-well at the root of its tail clean. If it
cannot do this the well dries up and becomes
a breeding-place for parasites. The bird with
a malformed beak, also, is unable to pick
insects off its body, and is thus condemned
to a life of torment.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“ J.W.W.”: A mistake to be avoided in
pasture-seed production is the growing ot
seed on the best land and saving it from
grass which has become rank. That rank
grass often produces seed low in germina-
tive power. Seed grown on medium or
comparatively poor land will be found best
for yielding a hardy and lasting pasture;
and I have found this rule applies to other
plants besides pasture grasses. When any
plant or grass is transferred to a better soil
than the one it grew in, it thrives better
than when positions are reversed.
“Venture”: To prevent your bull from
jumping fences or otherwise misbehaving
during the off season, put a chain or strong
strap round his horns and connect it to a
liobble-strap on the front leg, between knee
and fetlock. The connection should be short
enough to prevent him raising his head more
than half-way, long enough to allow him
to walk without much discomfort. Cast an
eye on him occasionally, lest his head get
chafed.
“Bill R.”: Before using boards intended
for the construction of troughs, bins, or
mangers give their edges a coating of glue.
It will prevent suncracks and they will
better withstand the nailing.
“Mudgee”: In loading lucerne hay on the
waggon in the paddock, it used to be the rule
to have one man on top and one or two
men throwing the hay up to him. This
tends to knock a considerable amount of
the leaf off. Don’t have anyone on the
waggon. With practice, it is amazing what
a load a man can put on without assistance.
Besides retaining all the leaf with this
method, it is much easier to unload than
when it lias been tramped down. And the
hay is not likely to sweat if it has been
brought in on the green side.
“Bloss”: Old balloon tubes make excellent
fly veils for horses. Take a piece lOin. by
13in. and cut into |in. strips, |in. apart,
to within -1-Jin. of top. Fasten to bridle
forehead band.
“Willeroo”: A simple device for tighten-
ing barbed wire is a piece of board the.
shape of a cricket bat and. nearly the same
size, with a slit sawn in the blade and about
6in. deep. Slip that on the wire close to
a barb and behind the post. Then by
pulling on the handle you get a strong
leverage that will tighten the wire suffi-
ciently to staple it. While this does the
work quickly, there is no risk of getting
pricked or scratched by the barbs.
“Mulgo”: With a piece of 3in. by 2in.
sawn timber, “Tena” (B. 16/11/’32) can
make only a straight shaft for his cart.
That isn’t satisfactory where there is much
turning to do, and isn’t comfortable for the
horse. I prefer a slab 3in. by 6in. split
from a spotted-gum log (split timber is not
so liable to break). Smooth one side, lay
your old shaft on that and mark it, then
cut out with the adze, finishing with plane
and spokeshave. A good shaft can also be
made from a sapling, choosing one thick
enough to permit of the sapwood being cut
away. If you can get one with a natural
bend in the right place it will be all the
stronger.
“Only Dave”: If you have a square iron
tank that is too far gone to hold water,
place it top uppermost on a high piece of
ground, or make an earth foundation about
Gin. high so that rain-water won’t flood it.
Cut one of the sides out with a cold chisel.
Place a double row of bricks at each end of
the floor, and two iron bars across, and
through the hole where the lid fitted put an
old piece of galvanised iron to act as a
chimney. You then have an excellent fire-
place in which to cook your fowl or pig
food.
“Sylvester”: Use of explosives sq,ves much
heart-breaking toil when clearing land for
ploughing ; but be careful with the detonators,
I hang them up on the job, in an old coat,
and remove one when I am ready to use it.
“Dai R.”: To prevent the attacks of bot-
flies. keep a bucket with a drop of kerosene
and a piece of blanket or cornsack in a handy
place and rub the horses down once every
24 hours. Special attention should be given
to the neck and legs. Early morning is the
best time. Sheep-dip and other mixtures
have been advocated, but kerosene beats them
all.
“McNoon”: The efficacy of lime-water
added to skim-milk for calves may be gauged
by watching the surface of the lime-water in
the barrel when settled. If there is a scum
the lime-water is satisfactory; if not, more
lime is needed.
“Cavesson”: In a potato slump any sys-
tem of feeding to stock is preferable to let-
ting the tubers rot. One low-price year in
South Gippsland, Strawberry being our chief
concern, we managed this way: A firm, level
area was selected as a feeding ground; an
extra horse was yoked and the dray was
loaded from the pit. The roller was hooked
on behind, close up. One man drove; another
fed out the spuds evenly from the tail of
the dray in front of the roller. No cows
were choked by big pieces and root-slices, and
costs were saved. Pigs, poultry and a few
sheep assisted at the daily clean-up; there
was no waste. Strawberry did well and no
complaints were received from the butter
factory.
“Awani”: Early spring rains were re-
sponsible for a great growth this year of
wild melon. Its vine resembles that of a
pie-melon and it produces small striped
fruit about half the size of a hen-egg. This
fruit when ripe contains a juice which', if
it gets into horses’ eyes, may make them
blind. The only sure way of getting rid of
the pest is to dig it out.
“Cavesson”: A prize awarded by the Sey-
mour (Vic.) Agricultural Society for the
best fleece exhibited went to the owner of
a merino wether which cut a fleece of 181 b.
as a two-tooth, 2441 b. as a four-tooth and
2141 b. last shearing. Anyone beat these
figures?
The Federal assistance to men on the land
in respect of the production of prim-
ary produce other than wheat will be at the
rate of 15s. per ton fpr each complete ton
of artificial manure used during the twelve
months to November 30, 1933. The amounts
due to producers in any Federal territory
will be paid direct by the Commonwealth;
those due to other producers through the
State Governments.

CHRISTMAS ISLAND
By J. H. M. ABBOTT.
THIS story has nothing to do with any
Christmas Island you will find in the
atlas. The place does not carry the
name now, nor indeed is it an island; but
in the year of Our Lord 1832, for one wild
week, it was Australia’s own genuine Christ-
mas Island, guarded by the Royal Navy
with the assistance of the army, and most
closely and interestedly watched by the
Government of Sir Richard Bourke, Captain-
General and Governor-in-Chief in and over
his Majesty’s Territory of New South
Wales.
The bit of land with which we have to
do has been known since Captain Cook
passed that way, northward bound, in 1770,
as Broken Plead; it overhangs the tiny
haven of Terrigal nestling below it and lies
somewhere about ten miles up the coast
from the entrance to Broken Bay, with’ the
rugged, serrated and bulging triple headland
of Cape Three Points in between. There it
was that Captain Charles McCosh, one of
the most truculent swashbucklers who ever
infested the South Seas, celebrated Christ-
mas exactly a hundred years ago, and be-
stowed, in his arbitrary fashion, a name
upon the headland to which it has
never had any geographic right. That was
the bold Charley’s way. If he chose to call
a headland an island, it had to be an
island—at least amongst tbe amazing col-
lection of rascals and scallywags who made
up the crew of the vessel he owned and
commanded, the schooner Highland Belle.
They knew what sorrowful results invari-
ably followed argument with Captain McCosh
when he was aboard his own ship.
Nobody in Sydney nowadays has any
traditional knowledge of the long, raw-
boned, red-bearded and villainous Scot who
first made an appearance in Port Jackson
in 1828, during the reign of Governor Dar-
ling, when he turned up in the brig Clans-
man, and speedily added to the spiciness
of local contemporary history; but he had
not been forgotten towards the end of ’32,
when he had the hardihood once again to
invade the little capital of New South
Wales. So well was he remembered that
a deputation of leading citizens immediately
waited on Governor Bourke for the express
purpose of making the impossibility of
Charles McCosh’s claims to hospitality un-
mistakably clear.
They did not allow the fact that his
Excellency was temporarily residing at
Parramatta to frustrate these benevolent
intentions, but drove out to the colony’s
second town, on a hot day towards the end
of November, and urged upon the secretary
that they had the very best of reasons for
being granted an immediate interview. The
party consisted of Mr. Simeon Lord, the
well-known merchant and ship-owner; Mr.
Robert Campbell, who may be similarly
described; and the Rev. John Dunmore Lang,
of the Scots Church. These three had
been deputed by about a dozen others to
see the Governor and explain to him all
about Captain Charles McCosh of the High-
land Belle. So thoroughly did they dis-
charge the duty entrusted to them that Sir
Richard was convinced he should not lose
a moment in making the personal acquain-
tance of that redoubtable mariner, and
promised the deputation he would proceed
to Sydney early in the morning and send
for the gentleman. Would they be good
enough to be present at the interview?
So, on the following forenoon, we behold
Mr. Charles McCosh, master mariner,
dressed in his Sunday best, somewhat aggres-
sively demanding admission at the door of
Government House, Messrs. Lord, Campbell
and Lang having already arrived there.
Captain McCosh’ was immediately shown
into the Governor’s office. There is not
space here to report the proceedings so
fully as might be desirable, but Sir Richard’s
final words to his new acquaintance will
sufficiently explain the situation in which
that gentleman found himself at the close
of the interview.
“Well, then, Captain McCosh,” the Gov-
ernor said, “what I have been told in your
presence by these three gentlemen has com-
pletely convinced me—in spite of your
denials and extenuations—that you are, to
oay the very least, an extremely undesirable
person to be permitted at large in the
colony of New South Wales. And, appar-
ently, the members of your crew are entirely
vorthy of their commander. Can you make
; our ship ready for sea within forty-eight
jours ?”
“And for why should I mak’ th’ Hielan’
3elle ready for sea, sir? ’Twas my inten-
;ion for to heave th’ ship down an’ refit.
?wa months wud he th’ verra least, y’r
Sx’lency.”
“You may have two days, sir—forty-
sight hours from to-morrow morning. Not
an hour longer. Should it be necessary for
your ship to be careened, you will find
harbors to the northward where this may
oe done. But I will not permit you to
remain here —do you understand, sir? Nor
may you go to Newcastle, or to Hobart
Town. You say you have come from the
West Coast of South America, by way of
the Islands. Well, my advice to you is to
go back there. At any rate, you must
leave Port Jackson within the time I have
mentioned. You may have every assistance
frorii the Commissariat Stores as regards
provisioning, provided you pay in cash for
such goods as you obtain. Wood and water
may be procured on the North Shore of the
harbor, and I will grant you the use of
two convict boats’ crews in completing for
sea in that respect. There are several
members of your ship’s company in Sydney
Gaol. They will be placed aboard the High-
land Belle shortly before you proceed to
sea. That is all, sir. Instructions as to
your departure will be conveyed to. you in
writing by the Naval Officer. Forty-eight
hours from noon to-morrow, sir—not a
moment longer. Good morning, Captain
McCosh.”
“Ye’ll hear mair aboot this, sir.”
“Should I hear any more about it at
this moment, sir, I’ll commit you to gaol
until the hour of your departure. Will
you be so good as to leave the room? I
have further business with these gentlemen.”
“An’ let me tell y’r Ex’lency that ye hae
beesiness wi’ three damned rogues!” snarled
Captain MoCosh as he withdrew.
H.M.S. Acheron, the smart 26-gun frigate
commanded by Captain the Hon. William
Barron, which was stationed on the east
coast of Australia in Governor Bourke’s
time, sailed out of Port Jackson on Christ-
mas Eve, 1832, on a mission of some import-
ance. She was to put Captain McCosh in
his place, which his Excellency and Captain
Barron had decided in conference was not
on the Australian" coast, or "anywhere near
it. The warship was to make sure that
many leagues of ocean should presently

separate the Highland Belle from the terri-
torial waters of New South Wales.
For the gaunt Scot’s ejection from Port
Jackson at the end of November with forty-
eight hours’ notice had not convinced the
enterprising mariner that Sydney had had
enough of him, or —what was more to the
purpose—that he had had enough of Syd-
ney. He had cleared for Batavia, and
had been reported as having passed the
mouth of the Hunter River on a course to
the north; but sudden and startling infor-
mation had just come to hand which indi-
cated that he was quite close to Port Jack-
son again, and in clandestine communication
with Sydney.
The Newcastle steam-packet William the
Fourth, running down the coast on her
lawful occasions, had been hailed off Broken
Bay by a solitary seaman in a dinghy, who
was taken aboard by Captain Taggart and
landed in the capital. The unfortunate
man had two black eyes, a broken nose, a
cutlass slash in the scalp and a back that
was scarred from a recent application of
the cat-o’-nine tails. The purple eye-sockets
and the fractured nasal bone, he informed
the police, were due to the hard fist of Cap-
tain Charles McCosh, of the Highland Belle,
which ill-reputed craft was then, he said,
lying in a little inlet to the nor’ard of
Broken Bay, where she had been for the
better part of a week, having returned to
the neighborhood of Sydney for a very
sinister purpose indeed. His lacerated head
had been earned in resisting the men whom
Captain McCosh had ordered to tie him
up for the flogging which had cut his back
to pieces. Two nights after its administra-
tion, he had managed to sneak away in a
small boat with the intention of pulling
down the coast to Port Jackson.,
The police sent the man —Robert Smollett
was his name—up to Government House,
knowing that his Excellency had taken much
interest in the departure of the Highland
Belle a few weeks previously, and there he
told a strange tale. The part of it that
interested Sir Richard Bourke was that
relating to the motive which had induced
Captain McCosh to return down the coast.
Briefly, this was to kidnap Messrs. Lord,
Campbell and Lang, in order to “take it
out” of them for the part they had played
in his expulsion from Sydney. A secondary
motive was the procuring of several women
of the convict class for himself and his crew
—a design impossible of fulfilment before
his departure in November, because of the
armed guard which had been placed on the
schooner and only withdrawn when she
weighed anchor.
To accomplish these designs, Captain
McCosh intended to run into Broken Bay
and lead a party of his men overland to
Manly, where they would take boats from
the fishermen and invade Sydney at night,
trusting to various carefully-planned ruses
to get hold of the three gentlemen upon whom
he desired to be revenged, and picking up
the women in some of the lower sort of
public-houses by the waterside and on “the
Rocks.” It was a bold and daring scheme,
and far from being an impossible one.
Charles MoCosh had done bigger things than
this during the course of his adventurous
career at sea.
It was dark when HALS. Acheron passed
out between the Heads. She stood sea-
ward on an easterly course until the Mac-
quarie Light was lost astern, when presently
she went about, and turned in towards the
land again on a slant that would bring her
to the coast above Broken Bay. When the
dawn came, she lay becalmed a few miles
to the nor’-east of Broken Head. Astern
the sky blazed with gold and orange, and
ahead the dark indigo line of the shore, with
the blue ranges behind it, was gradually
resolving itself into bays and valleys and
headlands. It was then that Captain Barron
gave orders to the first lieutenant for both
watches to be summoned on to the quarter-
deck, since he had something to say to
them.

stood in densely-packed array abaft the
mainmast, staring up at the poop and at
Captain Barron pacing slowly athwartships
his telescope beneath liis left arm and a
little smile hovering about his lips as he
oocasionallv glanced downward at the irre-
gUlar rows of surprised faces.

to attention.
“Ship’s company, hats off!” barked stout
Lieutenant Berry as the captain halted.
There was a tense silence as they waited
for “Staggerin’ Bill”—Captain Barron had
a notorious love for the dramatic moment —
to develop his latest astonishment.
“Men,” he said, “I wish you all a happy
Christmas, though I am extremely sorry
that the demands of duty have prevented you
from spending it in Sydney. However, some
of you will have the pleasure of attending
a Christmas party ashore this morning which
will, I am convinced, provide you with plenty
of entertainment. I regret that it is impos-
sible to take the whole ship’s company to
this diverting affair, but half of each watch
will have an opportunity of enjoying them-
selves. Mr. Berry”—he turned to the first
lieutenant —“I shall take command of the
landing party myself, and will leave the ship
in your charge. Please to see that half of
each watch, fully armed, is prepared to man
the boats as soon after breakfast as possible,
and make it breakfast-time as soon as you
can. Ensign Macbeth” —he addressed the
subaltern in charge of the dozen or so
soldiers of the 17th Regiment who had
accompanied the Acheron from Port Jack-
son—“l would be obliged if you would have
your men ready when the .boats shove off.
That will do, thank you, Mr. Berry. I think
you had better select the best-conducted men
from each watch for this excursion—l should
wish to make it a reward for good behavior
rather than a task. Thank you, that is all.”
An hour and a half later, as Captain
Barron in his gig led the little armada of
the Acheron’s boats shoreward, he ques-
tioned the disfigured Bob Smollett, who, still
in his bandages, sat in the bottom of the
captain’s boat.
“Now, my man,” he inquired, “what is
the strength of the party controlled by this
fellow McCosh? How many men has he?”
“There was just on forty i’ tli’ crew when
we first come to Sydney, y[r honor, an’ we
sailed wi’ six runaway prisoners when th’
Gov’nor sent us to sea last month. Since
we come back here Cap’n McCosh’s picked
up half a dozen more from th’ bushrangers
on th’ Hawkesbury
River. H'e’s now got
more’n fifty men
over yonder, sir. An
there was five women
to ok from Pitt’s
Water, what’d come
there from Sydney
Town th’ day afore
I runned away.”
“Why did he come
to this place—what
was his object?”
“Well, sir, for to
get a holt o’ them
three gemmen, i’ th’
main. But also on
account o’ th’
women, an’ for to
make a Christmas

the virtuous Mr.
Smollett. “I ’ardly
likes to soil y’r
honor’s ears a-talkin’
o’ sich willainy.”
“I can stand it,
my man,” said
“Staggei'in’ Bill”
with a little chuckle.
“Steer for the
schooner, Coxswain.
Mr. Macbeth, you
will please to guard
this vessel with your
men. You will dis-
arm her people and
confine them below. It is my intention,
after we have landed, to drive this rabble
down to the beach and put them aboard their
ship. I will leave you a dozen of the Ach-
eron’s company, under a midshipman, to
assist you in keeping order until we tow
her to an offing, when you will be taken off
again. You understand, sir?”
“Perfectly, Captain Barron,” replied
Ensign Macbeth with a grin on his pink-
and-white face. “I could wish we were
going ashore with you, sir,” he added a
little regretfully.
“I’ll tell you all about it, my dear sir.
Now men, give way.”
The Highland Belle, a schponer-rigged
vessel of about 200 tons burthen, lay close
inshore, her tall spars, with sails furled,
swaying gently to the long swell as she rode
at her anchor in the little bay now marked
on the chart as Terrigal Harbor. In less
than twenty minutes the soldiers and sailors
had been put aboard her, greatly to the sur-
prise of the half-dozen sleepy and unpre-
possessing sea-hooligans who had been left
on board by Captain McCosh.
It was about seven o’clock when the
Acheron’s boats were run up on the beach
behind Broken Head, on its northern side.
Captain Barron landed, and his men were
presently formed up on shore. A little way
inland, up the slope, were three or four
rough tents, made of old sails, and the blue
smoke of two or three cooking fires curled
up into the sunny morning atmosphere
against the deep green of the scrub on the
hillside. A few figures were moving about
near the fires, but the majority of the
campers seemed still to be wrapped in slum-
ber. By one of the tents a rough sapling
flagpole had been set up, and from it de-
pended limply, in the windless morning, what
looked like a Union Jack. The three or
four men about the smouldering fires had
frozen into immobility as they stared down
at the naval disembarkation in the little
bay; but presently one of them ran into the
tent near the flagstaff.


“Hoav i.s it they are so quiet!” Captain Bar-
ron inquired of the man Smollett. “The sun
is risen more than two hours.”
“ ’Tis th’ rum, y’r honor. There’s barrels
of it in th’ cap’n’s tent —that one by th’
flagstaff. They’ve bin a-livin’ on rum this
four or five days, ever since they come
ashore from th’ schooner. Sleepin’ it off, so
as to start afresh this mornin’.”
“Oh, of course,” said the captain—“that
Ayould be it, of course. Very well, Mr.
Staples”—he spoke to the lieutenant acting
as his second-in-command —“leave a guard
for the boats, and then dispose our people
so as to surround the camp. I will take
the crew of my gig and interview the head
THIS THING CALLED LOVE.

of this interesting colony. Be ready, of
course, to support me should the necessity
arise, although I don’t think we’ll have
much trouble beyond waking these gentry
up. iCoxswain, bring your crew and follow
me. Come, Smollett —I shall want you with
me.”
“Oh, y’r honor,” began Mr. Smollett’s pro-
test, but the captain silenced him with a
gesture.
With his midshipman aide-de-camp, Cap-
tain Barron led the way up the slope, the
crew of the gig, armed with cutlasses and
pistols, following after and driving the un-
willing Mr. Smollett before them with
muffled profanity and chaff. The battered
ex-member of the Highland Belle’s company
apparently took no pleasure in the prospect
of meeting his late commander. The re-
mainder of the Acheron’s men were climbing
the hillside in tAvo parties in order to sur-
round the camp on all sides.
As the captain’s following slowly climbed
the increasing declivity towards the tents,
the few astonished spectators of this in-
vasion came to life., and each of them lurched
presently out of sight into one or other of
the shelters.
For a few moments the naval men seemed
to have the slope to themselves. A _ dis-
turbed buzzing, however, came from within
the tents, and presently a woman squealed,
a man cursed loudly, and then one by one,
drunken-looking and sleepy-eyed, the crew
of the schooner crawled and staggered out
into the bright, hot sunlight. With gaping
mouths, and rubbing bleary eyes, the un-
lovely collection of obvious blackguards and
scallywags looked in astonishment at the
little band of grinning bluejackets who,
with drawn cutlasses and pistols in belts,
slowly approached their leader’s temporary
habitation.
Just as Captain Barron came to a halt
before it, Charles McCosh came stooping out
from beneath the inverted “V” of the
entrance. His tall figure straightened as
he emerged, and he stood staring at the com-
manding officer of H.M.S. Acheron with
amazement in his red-bearded countenance.
“Ma Goad!” he croaked in a dry and
husky voice. “ ’Tis young Mister Barron
himself! Now, wlia’d credit the like o’ yon.
'Tis a miracle—a miracle !” He
held out. his hand, and, to the astonishment
of the naval ratings behind him, Captain
Barron seized it in his own and shook it
heartily.
“Good heavens!” he exclaimed. “Why,
it’s Charley McNab, the captain-of-the-
maintop in the old Victory, as I’m a sinner!
In the name of all that’s wondrous, Charley,
how is it you’re Captain McCosh, supposed
to be the worst man in the South Seas, whom
I have orders to chaae away from the coast
of New South Wales? Surely there’s some
strange mistake. I could never forget' the
man who saved my life when I fell from
aloft in that gale o’ wind that blew us
down to the Straits a month before Tra-
falgar ! By the Lord, you are Charley
McNab!”
The big, rawboned Scot stared hard at
the captain of the Acheron, a gnarled and
bony hand gripping his red beard and his
hairy lips parted in a gape of wonder. A
magnificent man he looked as he stood at the
tent door in under-flannel and canvas
trousers, barefooted—as hard as nails and
fit for anything. Presently he spoke.
“Aye, Ah’m McNab —McCosh is juist ma
pireetical name, ye ken. And yersel’, sir?
A post-captain wi’ a fine frigate, an’ you th’
little laddie I pulled out o’ th’ watter off th’
Straits nigh thirty year agone! Weel, weel!
But come awa’ within, Captain Barron, sir.
There’s things to say betAvixt us that’s better
said in private.” He turned and put his
head inside the tent. “Ootside, Polly, lass
—oot th’ back way. Juist a lady-friend
from Sydney, Captain Barron. Will ye no
step inside, sir?” _ _
Mr. Midshipman Adair was
staggered when half an hour later
the captain came out of the tent
and ordered him to find the officer
in charge of the landing party and
inform him that it was his com-
manding officer’s order to withdraw
his men from Broken Head and
take them back aboard the
Acheron. Further, he was to re-
move the soldiers and seamen from
the Highland Belle. When he
conveyed the order to Lieutenant
Staples all that officer could say
was:
“Well, I’ll be damned! Small
wonder they call the owner ‘Stag-
gering Bill!’ ”
As Captain Barron walked down
to his gig accompanied by the fierce-
looking Scotsman, he asked the
latter a question:
“You give me your
word then, Charley,
that you’ll sail at day-
light to-morrow and go
right away? I can de-
pend upon your doing
this, for old times’
sake?”
“Aye, mon, an’ be-
cause we’re baith Lorrd
Nelson’s men. But tell
me, noo, Captain Barron.
Forbyc ye’d ever caught
me red-handed as a
pirate, an’ yersel’ a
post-captain, would ye
lia’ hangit me to y’r
yairdarm ?”
“Certainly, Charley—
but with great reluct-
ance.”
“Ye’d lia’ done richt,
an’ as his Lorrdship
would ha’ done. Ah,
weel, guid-bye to ye,
then, an’ Ah’m glad ye
came to Christmas Island, sir.”
“But why do you call Broken Head an
island, McNab? There’s nothing of the
island about it.”
“Aye, but there is that, Ah’m thinkin’,
Captain Barron. The geography books ca’
a piece o’ land surroundit by watter an
island. Weel, this bit o’ land’s surroundit
by rum, so Ah’m thinkin’ ’twill be an island
also for juist this Christmas. Fare ye well,
sir—an’ gie my respects to Governor
Bourke.”

before. A week ago he could not have done
it—not even a day ago. That first six days
had been Hell: the sense of catastrophe, of
desolation ; the shattering of an ordered
life; the end of a mapped career. Starva-
tion gibbering at his elbow as he trod mile
upon mile of hot streets in unavailing
search for a new bread and butter burrow
into which to slink and shelter! Above all,
the mortification of the reject in the battle
of life and the work of the world! The
ANOTHER WRONG ANSWER.
THE FISHER-LADY: “I came straight here from the beauty parlor."
THE NASTY LITTLE BRUTE: “Closed, was it?”
thought of putting an end to it all had been
very attractive then. Once or twice he had
almost worked himself up to the necessary
pitch.
He could laugh at this sick insanity now.
Yet he did not know what had wrought this
day-old miracle. Freedom, and the warm
sunshine, and the winds of God sweeping
through his starved clerk’s soul, perhaps;
or (and this he thought more likely) the new
perspective from this lofty perch. He had
never before been able to spend a day watch-
ing his fellow-men working. Life had been
too full and leisure too precious for that.
And how ridiculous they looked from a hun-
dred feet up! Toy figures, pushing, fuming,
straining, running to a shout, moving like
automatons to the blast of a whistle! A
fine way to spend life!
It had taken him half a day to achieve
this perspective, another half to apply it to
his own life. If these men were slaves to
a Avhistlc or a shout, then he, for thirteen
of his twenty-seven years, had been slave
to a bell. From the cheap alarum which
flicked him from his bed in the morning, to
the breakfast bell at his boarding-house;
the conductor’s bell spurring his last-minute
dash for the latest tram which would land
him at the office in time to defeat that inex-
orable beast of a bundy clock, with its ting
of malicious satisfaction if it could register
a second after the hour. In the office,
bells again. Four of them on the wall above
his head, jangling in hideous discord all day
long, each of them with the power to pull
him from his seat and send him scurrying
to its source in secretary’s, accountant’s,
manager’s or general manager’s office.
For three years "he had hated that general
manager’s bell, a clamorous, insistent devil
with a \ 7 oice louder and shriller than all
the others. Two men before him had been
sacked for failing to reach the general
manager’s door before the bell stopped
ringing. It rode upon his nerves. Sub-
consciously he was listening for it all day,
ready to heave himself from his chair and
dash beneath the flap of the counter, which
there was no time to raise—an undignified
scramble which long years did not rob of
its humiliation.
The first faint dawn of realisation of his
freedom came to him in the recollection that
never again need he answer that bell. And
then, as his train of thought laboriously
widened, he came to see how their jangle had
ruled and ridden him in every hour of his
waking life. He forgot his fears of starva-
tion, ignored the hopelessness of the days
ahead, in the glorious intoxication of liberty,
The mood passed, of course; but it lelt
one unsliakeable resolve. He would never
go back to servitude. He began to plan,
H’e had a few pounds, and on the track he
could get rations. On the bank of a western
river where the fishing was good a man's
needs were cheaply met. It would be a long
time before starvation reared its ugly head.
It wasn’t getting on in the world; it wasn’r
providing for that all-powerful future of
which ail his life he had gone in fear. But
some strain of a far-off gypsy ancestor whis-
pered that there was more to life than the
swarm for place and money; that there, was
air, and sunshine, and the i r ast domain of
nature; above all, freedom.
ITe had acted immediately on his decision,
cancelled his rented room—for his small
savings must be conserved —and spent the
night here on the seat where he had found
his freedom. He had bought his few needs
for the track, and tQ-morroAV he would set
off.
A whistle bletv shrilly, and the men on
the coaling wharf below melted away. He
rose and moved to the single rail guarding
the face of the cliff. Five o'clock. Lean-
ing there, he watched them file away, stiff
and weary, to creep to stuffy houses and
seek in sleep renewed strength to answer
the bells and the shouts and the whistles of
the morrow.
But for him, to-morrow, a far track and
a new life! He lifted his face to the cloud-
less sky, and laughed.
Midnight struck. One. As the stroke
died upon the air a bell upon the wl|arf
gave clamorous tongue. The sleeper on the
seat started ; lurched forward in a shambling
run; ducked low beneath the single rail.
* * * *
The morning papers had the story:
“Shortly after 1 a.m. the body of John
Linsey (27), clerk, was discovered on the
rocks near the coaling wharf at the foot of
Wallaby Point. Deceased had recently lost
his employment, and it is thought that this
preyed on his mind. The body was dis-
covered by the fire brigade, which had been
called to the spot through the ringing of
an automatic alarm, which had been set in
motion by a short circuit. Death had
occurred only a few minutes previously.”
Outside.
I’M out with the grass in the paddocks,
Out with the grass and the sun,
And crimson clouds flaunt to the west-
ward
As the heat of the long day is done.
Far away, from the furthest horizon,
Where the yellow grass kisses the sky,
Charmed by the tremulous witch-craft of
space,
Comes the lone curlew’s lingering cry.
I’m out with the grass in the paddocks.
At last, at long last, I’m alone,
While the grass sings its murmurous, rust-
ling song
In a glorious monotone.
I'm out with the grass in the paddocks,
Out with the grass and the rain.
The yellow stalks hail the pattering drops
And drink deeply. and deeply again;
And I hear all around me a murmur
Of that dim, inarticulate strife,
As each tiny seed, in its cradle of dust,
Hears the call and awakens to life.
I’m out with the grass in the paddocks:
My face and my body are wet,
And are freed from the smears and the filth
of the earth
And each lingering tinge of regret.
I’m out with the grass in the paddocks,
Out with the grass and the night.
There’s a round-breasted moon to the east-
ward
And the stars are just pin-points of
light.
Now the lazy night-breeze calls a message.
Calls it ever so gently to me,
As the Heights never called to the hillmen
Or as ships called men down to the
sea.
I’m out with the grass in the paddocks.
It’s tall and it’s lush round my bed.
For that grass and those gums and my soul
are alive,
And only my body is dead.

FROM CHINA TO PERU.
The other day [this is the story told by
Mrs. Gregory, of the “Gulf News,” Croydon,
N.Q., who writes from London] I wanted
to open a banking account here, so I blithely
marched into the city. “Times are bad,” I
thought, “and money is scarce. Which of
these struggling institutions will I honor
with my patronage?” I looked them over
critically, rejected the one where the mes-
sengers wear strawberry “tails” and scarlet
waistcoats, because such a color scheme was
agonising to my aesthetic sense, and finally
selected a famous and honorable pile in
Threadneedle-street. I plunged happily in-
side, and, light-hearted as the welcome guest
I felt I was, trod the echoing archways on
my road to the accountant’s room. I entered
with the benign smile of one about to confer
a favor, and was greeted by a hunched-up,
elderly individual, all dressed in black, who
eyed me with extreme disfavor. “Good morn-
ing,” I said brightly; “I’ve come to open an
account.” The expression of disfavor deep-
ened. “I’ve got the money here,” I went
on. “I want to pay in so much, and then
if you’ll give me a cheque-book” “Do
we know you, Madam?” the individual in
black boomed at me. “No,” I said. “Why?”
“We don’t open accounts in this fashion,”
he announced unpleasantly. “Why not?”
I asked innocently. “I’ve brought the money
with me.” “But we don’t know you.” The
dark suspicion deepened. “Have you got
anyone to recommend you?” “No, but,” I
explained patiently, “I want to pay money
in, not draw it out.” “That doesn’t matter.
We can’t possibly accept money unless you
are recommended.” This was a new idea.
I didn’t see why one should need to be re-
commended when one wanted to hand over

banks competing for my favors. “Oh, well,”
I said in a huff, “if you don’t want my
account I’ll take it somewhere else.” “You
won’t get anyone to accept an account from
an unrecommended person,” the dark indi-
vidual declared with dour emphasis. “Well,”
I replied, “in Australia”- —— “Oh,” he
interrupted, comprehension dawning, “you
come from Australia, do you?” “Yes,” I
admitted; “I’m a journalist” “Why
didn’t you tell me that before?” He even
smiled. The comprehension was complete.
To be an Australian and a journalist evi-
dently covered all eccentricities. He
accepted my account and I went out, much
relieved. But I am still wondering where
disreputable people do keep their money.
They must all have caches in the chimney-
piece or under the mattress. If I became
shadily possessed of £5OOO, would I really
have to run round fruitlessly looking for a
bank to accept it? What a lot of private
caches there must be —eh?

Very important research work is being
done in India in connection with the boll-
worm, the most terrible of the pests which
afflict the cotton-grower. In India there
are two varieties. There is the pink boll-
worm (Platyedra gossypiella saunders ) of
grey-brown color, with dark blotches and
suffusions, and, wings with long brown
fringes; and there are the spotted boll-worms
(Earias fabia and insulana). Of these, the
first one can be identified by its broad green
band extending from the face to the apex of

each wing, save in some' cases where the
green band may be absent, the whole wings'
being ochreous or buff being developed. The
other has the fore-wings bright green. It
has been found that the larvae of the spotted
boll-worms are carried over from season to
season in the cotton stalks, which are left
in the ground; wherefore every stalk should
be pulled up and burned. The pink worm is
carried over in the seed. The remedy lies in
killing the larvae; this can be done by heat-
ing the seeds to 60deg. C. or 140 deg. F.—
this temperature, it is found, does not affect
the vitality of the seed.

“ J.H.N.”: T. Martyn’s description of the
failure of the New Australia Communistic
experiment in Paraguay (S. America),
written on the spot, recalls Rosamond Dale
Owen’s account of the failure of New Har-
mony, Robert Owen’s historic colony. “The
failure,” she wrote, “was purely a moral
one. It might have been a Paradise were
men and women ready to enter Paradise.
Instead, the remarkable group gathered at
New Harmony, who were, in the main, quite
above the ordinary status of society, even
these representatives who had reached an
unusually high development, brought the
experiment to ruin in three short years,
although Robert Owen had proved himself
to be remarkably gifted as an organiser, and
all the material circumstances were excel-
lent.” This experiment was made in
America in 1825.

“Sheller”: All sorts of fancy diving-
dresses and. undresses have been tried on
the northern pearling grounds ; and one that
was introduced 10 years ago by a Japanese,
Y. Kataoka, called the Ongushi respirator, is
still talked about. It had the appearance
of a large pair of swimming goggles, fitted
with rubber edges to the lines of the face,
covering the eyes and the nostrils, but leav-
ing.the mouth free. It was held in position
by two elastic bands clipped together at
the back of the head. The air was fed to
the diver through a small rubber pipe; it
entered the respirator, or “mask,” at the
will of the diver, who governed the supply
by a pair of small clips held between his
lips. He exhaled the used air from his
mouth into the sea. No helmet was worn;
even the heavy boots, w-ere discarded. The
diver went down dressed in white cotton
overalls, with a roll of lead around his waist
and a life-line attached to breast and
shoulders; his mobility was thus in no way
impaired. At the first public test a diver in
a suit could just hobble along as fast as the
lugger drifted; a diver with the respirator
walked round and round the boat as she
drifted. Tests were ■ then made at. Darnley
Island —two divers used the respirator and
in two dips (one each) recovered 36 shells;
four divers using the old dress, one dip each,
recovered 22 shells. Using the respirator one
man was on the bottom 14imin. and took
3jmin to come up; another was down
and took 4min. to come up. The
best record of the men in diving-suits was
s£mip. on the bottom and 7imin. coming

checked). The Shellers’Assoc, paid Kataoka
£5OO for a six months’ option; but, though
some divers became fairly proficient, they
were all afraid of sharks, and the option
had to be abandoned. But the great advant-
age of mobility was proved ; and to-day some
divers work with the old helmet and corslet,
but without the heavy dress. The air pres-
sure inside the helmet prevents the water
from rising too far ; at a depth of 30 fathoms
it is up to the diver’s chin. Divers who have
become expert in this method of working
win much more shell than those using a
dress. Sharks do not attack divers in a
dress, and so far have not attacked men work-
ing with the helmet but no dress, although
the brutes have evidenced much curiosity
and actually rubbed against a diver on one
occasion. The diver’s attitude is to remain
perfectly still, believing that the shark is
just as afraid as he is, and a false move
ou his part would induce action from the
shark. Kataoka stated that a certain kind
of flannel was objectionable to sharks, and
divers using it would not be attacked. But
there is no evidence on that point.

From a letter in the “Malayan Mercan-
tile Journal” :
The greatest drawback to Australian trade is that
Australian firms never pack as well as American or
English firms, their labels are rotten and they assume
that if the Australian public are satisfied every-
body else should be. Their rates of wages are miles
ahead of any other country’s, so the cost of produc-
tion is too high; lastly the banks control them and
will not allow any firm to export without the cash.
This alone always will stop export. Even when they
had a Trade Commissioner here and another in Shang-
hai, trade did not increase a pound, as no exporter
could give credit. It had to be cash or nothing. Even
the fruit trade that Singapore did—and it was a very
large one—was lost owing to prices. Australian
cost of production will not allow export, even with
25 per cent, exchange. One firm here had to destroy
seven tons of food and canned goods and other firms
have done the same from time to time. Made-up or
manufactured articles have no finish and can be
classed as second or third grade. All the Australian
firms want is somebody to get the business for
nothing; then they send along bad articles —do not
mind if no more orders come as long as they get
away with the one shipment.

The last meeting of the society took place
at the home of the secretary,' the president
(Mr. Dreary) having committed suicide.
Members were reminded of overdue subscrip-

Income Taxation.
Following another reminder regarding sub-
scriptions the vice-president read a list of
members who had been made bankrupt in
the past month, and then invited the visitor
of the evening, a leading wowser, to give his
notorious lantern-lecture on Israel Trium-
phant. (Members with mortgages on tlieif
homes were allowed to leave the room.) The
weekly “Cheer-up Cutting” contest was won
with a clipping from the “Daily Yap,” which
showed that, as another 1000 . farmers had
been driven off tlieir holdings, the Govern-
ment would be .able to set another 1000 un-
employed up in farms of their'own.
The meeting closed with the reading of
the latest unemployed statistics and wheat
and wool prices. The secretary then reported
that burglars had got into i the society’s
room the night before and drunk the supper,
so members walked home in a steady down-
pour of rain debating the respective advant-
ages of death by pneumonia and pleurisy.

NOTE TO MY BANKER.
While not, at the. present juncture, threat-
ening that I will discharge the whole —or,
indeed, any part of—my debt in bar gold, I
must ask you to seriously consider the possi-
bility of my taking drastic'action of the
kind should you be so ill-advised as to stand
on your strict legal rights. It is merely a
matter, in the last resort, of my being able to
get hold of the bar gold. I will leave you
to envisage the consequences should I be
driven- to this measure of desperation.
You have Refused —impelled thereto, I
make no doubt, by the short-sighted policy of
your directors —to accept payment in leading
articles, poems, light verse, or/and para-
graphs on topics of current interest. Stand-
ing on the letter of our Original agreement
you. demand (a) the repayment in cash of
the sum originally borrowed, or (h) in-
terest on same less the statutory 22| per
cent. I shall be in a position to meet your
claims in respect of the instalment falling
due at the end of the present month, despite
the demands inseparable from the approach-
ing festive, season (so-called) involved in
the purchase of extra drinks and food and
presents for members of my family, always
assuming (and far be it from me to suggest
the contingency; is a probable or even pos-
sible one) that my former friend Brown
repays,tlie whole, or any part of, the sum
I was mug enough to lend him on the
security of his estate. (The Brown estate,
as you are ho . doubt aware, has decreased
in value: by 75 per cent., and is now unsale-
able at a tenth of wliat I lent on it—or,
for that matter, at any price whatsoever.)
; Let us, therefore, face the situation like
reasonable men. It is doubtful, for the
reasons mentioned, whether I shall be able to
pa"y you anything this year. It is certain
that I shall not be able to pay next year, or
in any succeeding year. The money has
been blazed away in that insensate social
warfare whose tragic records may be found
inscribed in the form • of! items about cock-
tail parties, race lunches, dinners, dances,
“But I bet I had more fun GETTING full."
etc., in tlie Smart Set section of the “Sunday
Driveller.” Financially speaking (to borrow
another war-time idiom), I have been “sunk
without a trace.” Let us declare the whole
transaction “tabula rasa” —how these ex-
pressions of 17 or 18 years ago do recur, to
be . sure! So far as I am concerned, the
affair is at an end.

MISS MAFFLIN.
BY VELIA ERCOLE.
THE houses in that street had been
owned and lived in by affluent people
at one time, and their solid construc-
tion and pleasant if severe facades gave no
hint of the makeshift lives which their
present inhabitants led. Now proud privacy
had gone out of the street and it figured
conspicuously in those columns of the news-
papers which offered furnished rooms, apart-
ments or board and residence to a home-
less public.
Because the neighborhood still retained
some flavor of the fashionable, the houses
were leased for the most part by people of
the class which “has seen better days,”" or
should have seen them; widows reduced
from comfortable to decidedly uncomfortable,
circumstances; gentlemen retiring with their
wives and a small pension ; people who, in
possession of a small capital and no parti-
cular ability, see in the letting of rooms
both security and a certain leisure; people,
in short, whom we will call “genteel,” who
refer to their lodgers as paying guests and
who offer a refined atmosphere and homely
surroundings in place of the efficiency one
finds in the more impersonal, more business-
like establishments.
I have always fought shy of this par-
ticular type of rooming-house and its land-
lady, who must never be called a landlady,
and who sooner or later entangles one in
the pathetic web of her confidences. An
afternoon comes when the woman knocks
timidly on your door, informs you that she
has just made a cup of tea, and would you
care to have one with her? Of course, if
you are busy....
You are weak. You know that in ex-
change for the cup of tea you will probably
barter your very soul. You follow the
woman into her room, which is furnished
somewhat better than your own, and has
about it that air of permanency which yours
can never have.
Ever afterwards decency forbids you to
complain because your bed-linen is not
changed regularly, because your gas-fire is
faulty, your telephone message undelivered,
your bath luke-warm, and your weekly bill
mounting steadily. Over the cup of tea
the woman lias told you that yon and she
will be real friends. You arc real friends.
You know her sorrows and tribulations, you
know what she thinks about when she wakes
up in the night and you know that she
doesn’t know how she is to meet the next
month’s rent. And, knowing all this, your
complaints must die in your rebellious breast.
But that day I was tired. I had been
looking since morning for rooms. It was
raining. There was a red shade on the
lamp in the wide hall, and the usual black,
carved, imitation Bokhara chairs and brass
plaques looked less usual than usual. The
hall seemed pleasant and the bed-sitting
room at the top of the house which was
shown me not less so.
If there i,s a delicate way of inquiring
the rent of rooms I have never learned it.
I should like a formula for dealing with
these landladies who must never be called
landladies. I saw the little woman before
me quiver at the rude shock of my demand,
though I looked away as I made it. I s'poke
casually—casually, as though I were talking
in my sleep—of something unimportant—
insubstantial as a dream.
She drooped her head. “Well, what do
you think?” she asked. “I’m afraid I’m not
a business woman. I’ll leave it to you.
Usually, you know, there are two people in
it.' It’s a beautiful room. It used to be
my drawing-room. Of course, I’ll have to
put in the gas-ring.”
I should have been warned by that. But
the rain was pouring down relentlessly. I
liad no heart to look further.
While most delicately she lured me into
naming a figure far in excess of the room’s
worth, I observed her, and realised, what I
had not before realised, that she was the
ugliest woman I had ever seen. If a monkey
were given human flesh, preserving its bent
legs and long arms, its million wrinkles,
it would look very like Miss Mafflin in
immature. That was her name, Mops
Mafflin. She told me her Christian name
once the business of the rental had been
brought to a conclusion. “Call me Mops,”
she said. “My darling Guardy called me
Mops. It was my hair. He adored it. He
simply adored it.”
I looked with what admiration I could
assume at this object of the hitherto unsus-
pected Guardy’s adoration. Red the hair
was, long-since coarsened by repeated dyeing.
So to your monkey of flesh you must add
a bush of coarse, red hair, and over the
eyes you must put round tortoise-shell
glasses. But even doing all this you will
not have captured the full horror, because
Miss Mafflin was that thing which is not
nice to see. She was an old woman, as
her wrinkled face and her worn body testi-
fied, but out of her bright eyes looked youth;
avid, unquenchable, unappeased youth. In
a young body it would liav£ been a very
lovely thing—a clean flame and a just ardor
—but was, in this mummy of a woman, per-
verse and repellent.
As I regarded her, almost entranced, she
reached out a claw of a hand and touched
my face.
“Not bad,” she said. “Your skin. But
feel mine.”
She caught my hand, which could not of
its own volition have achieved her flesh. I
expected Heaven knows what chill strange-
ness. But it was warm and human and
soft.
“Like a baby’s, isn’t it?” She began to
massage her face with her fingers, slowly,
expertly, from the chin, upwards. But
though she did this with concentration, she
had not forgotten me. She continued to
talk.
“I must get rid of these lines. I will
in time, with a new treatment I have. I’ve
a most marvellous woman. I’ve taken a
course in beauty culture. I’ll do your face
for you one day, dear. When I went into
the Academy the girls thought I was old,
GIFTS TO THE BRIDE.
“I suppose your daughter received many felicitations at her wedding, Mrs. Murphy?”
“Yes, your Rivrince, and six salad bowls.”
because of these lines. But Miss Smart —
she’s this woman, the head of it—she said:
‘Oh no! Oh no ! Miss Mafflin is a young
woman. Those lines come from shock.’ She
explained to thejn all about how shock had
relaxed the skin. She, could tell. She
guessed my age to the year. Thirty-four.
But trouble and sickness”....
I said I was in rather a hurry and she
let me go. We w r ould have long talks, she
said. I must look on her as. a real «friend.
She knew someone like me would come
along, because Guardy was watching over
her. He sent such nice people to her. She
would tell me about him.
I noticed that she was crying. My
mummy monkey was crying! And as she
cried she did not seem an old woman at
all. but a very young child, encased in
that shrivelled body, looking through the
HARMLESS.
“Come in an’ ’ave a drink. ’Sh all right, the wife can’t bite you—she always sleeps
with her teeth in the bathroom.”
thick glasses on a world it was for ever
denied.
Why didn’t I write a note next day and
say 1 had made other arrangements? I
tried. I realised the strange mesmerism of
Miss Mafflin when I found I w r as making
excuses, writing that I had decided to visit
a friend, and that in a few weeks....
Perhaps Guardy was looking after her. I
found later that my room had been empty
all the year, and that three other rooms in
the house were empty, and that my two
pounds a W9ek was to mean a great deal
to her.
The next day, still telling myself that I
liad no intention of remaining with her, I
went to Miss Mafflin’s and there I stayed
in extreme discomfort for over a year. I
stayed until the evening when I regarded
Miss Mafflin and saw that the pitiful child
no longer looked through the eye-windows
of that shrivelled encasing. On that even-
ing I breathed a prayer to Guardy. “Find
her Someone else,” I besought; “I’ve served
my time.” And I went.
Possibly Guardy helped her. There was
a photograph of him in Miss Mafflin’s
sitting-room. A gentle old creature he
appeared, one wdio deserved to be with God ;
but a sinner, if carelessness may be reckoned
a sin. An old friend of her family, he had
cared for Miss Mafflin since the death of her
parents had left her an unprotected young
girl, This she told me after a few days,
weeping, expatiating as she wept on the
goodness of Guardy. He had been most
loving and generous. He had taken this
house, furnished it, secured a housekeeper
and a staff of servants, and, except for regu-
lar visits and the occasional demand of her
company on trips—l gathered he had large
business interests all over the country—he,
had not interfered with her life in any
way.
That I believed this unquestioiiingly -you
must put down to the mesmerism of Miss
Mafflin. The story was given color by
another enlarged photograph of a man re-
ferred to as “poor Alfred.” Alfred had been
her fiance, and, after an engagement last-
ing eight years, a time of great, if restrained
bliss, a fatal appendicitis had removed
Alfred. So he, too, was with God. I won-
dered if the two men ever had their Heaven
a little spoiled by the thought of the thing
they had done to Miss Mafflin, of the youth
they had left unsatisfied, in the body they
had left unprotected.
Alfred in those eight years had kissed
Miss Mafflin three times. She told me that
shyly, squinting up at me through, her round
glasses, rubbing her thin little knees with
quick, vigorous rubs.
“He was a spiritual man. He loved
poetry and music. You should have heard
him sing. I’d play for hours and he’d sing.
He said he couldn’t sing with anyone the
way he could with me.”
“But why,” I asked with
crude curiosity, “did he kiss
you only three times? Why
didn’t you get married?”
She stammered. She grew
embarrassed. I thought she
was going to cry, as she
frequently did, and I knew
I could not bear it.
“Some men are like that,”
I said. “But it’s just as
well you didn’t marry him.
There’s more to marriage
than music.”
“Yes. Marrying wouldn’t have....
altered him. He never really meant to
marry me. Not that, there was anyone else.
There were no women at all. He didn’t
care for women that. way. He adored me,
but lie used to say that our relationship... .
I mean that anything else would spoil it.
Sometimes he said he’d like to be a monk.’’
I had proofs of an actual existence of both
Alfred and Guardy, but of none of the
other men who had loved and lost Miss
Mafflin. These men were legion, and their
fates almost all spectacular and helpful in
the wrinkling of Miss Mafflin. There was
one (if she told me his name I’d know
him) who had died of pneumonia so sud-
denly that tickets he had bought to take
himself and Miss Mafflin to the theatre had
had to be used by the servants. Another
was killed in a train accident; and one.
with whom she had quarrelled, betook him-
self and his despair to Mexico and had
been shot by bandits. A few lived on
despairing. There was one, the loveliest
boy, who, not realising his affection was
reciprocated, had married another woman
and was shockingly unhappy. Occasionally
Miss Mafflin had met him in the street, and
on each occasion he had gone pale, had
asked her to tea and had spoken of “put-
ting an end to it all.”
I began to feel that a separate shock
must have gone , to each separate wrinkle on
Miss Mafflin’s face. But the greatest shock
of all was Guardy—poor, darling Guardy.
After six months the story of Guardy
emerged from its chaste and sentimental
wrappings. Guardy had loved her. He
had seen her in the shop where she was
working, and had loved her, as men of sixty
will sometimes love even ugly little girls,
and it had been his delight to cherish her,
to surround her with comfort and luxury,
to laugh at her amusing antics, to refresh
himself in her youthful vitality. And I
think she must have been amusing and
appealing in her ugliness, which would have
been quaint with youth to illumine it. She
loved him, too, as a young girl would love
a gentle, elderly man who lifted her from
poverty and friendlessness to luxury and
loving attention. She was quite passionate
in her gratitude even now. But her love
and gratitude must have been chains which
weighed heavily upon her. Ifor twenty-five
years they bound her, and from sixty Guardy
grew to be eighty-five, and the youth of
Miss Mafflin went, to his amusing. He had
been dead a year, she told me. And this
was a lie, though I did not know it until
I found out the whole pathetic lie.
But truth, at. all events, was the fact
that he died suddenly and left her entirely
unprovided for, and that he had a family
which wrote through its solicitors that they
were sorry, but in the circumstances....
and they regretted.... but they had been
totally unaware of her existence until her
letter reached them. And surely she would
understand that any further ' correspond-
ence
It was one of my fellow-roomers who told
'ne about this particular delusion of Miss
Mafflin.
She tells everyone he’s been dead a year.
IYe been here ten years and he’d been


dead Lord knows how long then. But its
a fact that he left her without a penny.
She got me to write to the family once. I
did it, not knowing the whole thing had
been finished years since.”
There is much and more of Miss Mamin
which she told me through days and nights
—she had a habit of creeping up to my
room at any hour of the night or early
morning, complaining that she could not
sleep that the phantoms were round her
again, telling her to throw herself out ot
the window, and she had made some tea
and would I like a cup?
I don’t know if I loved her or loathed
her. Perhaps Sinbad loved his Old Man of
the Sea in a way. I know that I could
never deny her, any more than Sinbad could
have denied his incubus, until the night of
which I will now speak. I knew then that
I must cease to pity Miss Mafflin, and that
the human heart cannot contain too much
of another’s woe.
I was dressing for dinner, Some friends
had invited me and I was happy. I was
singing in my room, and felt impatient when
I heard the timid double-knock on my door.
I did not want to be depressed that even-
ing. But Miss Mafflin, when the opened
door revealed her, was not depressing. Sue
stood there grinning her funny monkey grin.
She seemed ashamed and pleased with her-
self. Her expression on a normal face would
liave been coy. • ...
“We’re looking rather wonderful to-night,
aren’t we?” I said. “Going to a party?
She was so heavily rouged that only a
blush of high voltage would have reached
tlie surface of her cheeks. But she cast
down her eyes.
“Something’s happened,” she said myster-
iously. She came into the room then, and
I saw that she was trembling with excite-
ment. . „
“Do tell. I love things happening.
“Well, promise you won’t tell anyone.
Swear.” ~
“Cross my heart and hope to die ....
“Well—do you. like this dress?’
She pirouetted, she turned her bony,
crooked little form this way and that, lhe
dress showed off her appalling figure, lelt
no doubts as to her bowed legs, her thick
ankles. The low neck revealed her wrinkled
throat. But what of it? She was pleased
as a child with a new party frock.
“It suits you very well. It s new,
isn’t it?”
“Yes. I had no business to buy it. But
I thought”
“Of course.” .
“I’ve spent the afternoon down at the
Academy. Really they’re marvellous. Feel.
I felt her cheek.
“They really are marvellous, Judy, she
said. “You must let me bring you down
there some time” (an old argument).
“If they can achieve the same results for
me. I will. But why all this magnificence?’
“Well, you’ve sworn, haven’t you?”
“Will I swear again? A more dreadful
oath?”
“No. I know you won’t tell anyone.
But —well, this morning the ’phone rang.
I went and a man’s voice said: ‘ls that
Miss Mafflin?. Miss Fops Mafflin?’ I said
yes. Then he said, ‘You don’t know who 1
am?’ He had the most wonderful voice,
low, cultured. Something like Alfreds. A
voice with music in it, and as if he were
happy. I said no, who is it? My dear,
you’ll hardly th'ink it’s true. But he said
he was a great friend of a friend of mine
who is always talking about me. He’s been
wanting to meet me for months, and this
friend won’t introduce him, just to tease
him. He said lie’s heard all about my
funny little ways, and things I say, and
the way I play the piano” she broke
off, looking at me suspiciously.
“You’re laughing!”
“God forbid. I’m thrilled. Go on.
“Well, he said, when he heard my voice,
he knew that all he’d been told was true, and
he said why couldn’t we meet somewhere
and not wait for this friend. He said
lie wouldn’t tell me anything about him-
self I was to humor him, and he begged
me to meet him to-night. He fixed a place
and time, asking me to dinner. Of course, I
said no, that I was not in the habit-ot
meeting men to whom I’d never been intro-
duced and who wouldn’t give their names.
But he said if he gave his name I d know
him, and perhaps his friend had mentioned
him, and that I mightn’t want to come
then. Then he laughed and he said : Now
go on. Take a chance. I’ll be waiting
exactly on the corner at the kerb; 111 be
carrying a walking-stick, and if you don t
like the look of me you can just turn
round and run right home again. Then he
said women with lovely voices like mine
with the devil in them were born to take
chances.”
I found the story incredible. Another
one of her lies. I told myself, and I pitied
her; but I wished to high Heaven that she
would not feel the daily necessity of con-
vincing me of her youth and her power to
attract. Only the day before I had been
compelled to "receive the story of a young
ecclesiastical student whom she had met on
a ferry-boat, and who at the end of. the
half-hour’s passage had told her that, if it
had not been too late but being too late
he would bring her welfare to his prayers.
But it appeared that if this, too, were
a lie, she was going to unusual lengths to
deceive me. The dress was certainly new.
I was long since acquainted with her ward-
robe. Most of it had come from mine and
other guests who had occupied her rooms.
She was an arrant and shameless beggar
for pretty clothes and furbelows. Her hair
was a more brilliant red than I remembered
it from the day before. She was doing
the thing thoroughly, I told myself. And
by even more than these material signs was
strength given to this latest delusion. Her
whole personality seemed to have undergone
some subtle change. I felt that, could her
soul have been detached from her body, it
would have been a young, glowing thing,
with all the shine and the shyness of un-
tried girlhood.
So I played my share’in the comedy. I
reiterated my interest. I insisted, when
she affected to demur, that she should keep
the appointment, which was down town in
a place public enough. Nothing could pos-
sibly happen to her, I said. If she didn’t
like the look of the man, etc., etc.
So, she went, borrowing a wrap of mine.
I pinned my own flowers in the lapel, and
I speeded her.
It was after eleven o’clock when I re-
turned from my dinner-party. Passing down
the hall I saw a light under Miss Mufflin’?
door. I hesitated, and finally knocked. I
had told her I would be most anxious to
hear about her tryst, and I thought that,
as she must have heard me come in, this
ignoring of her would seem churlish, or,
worse, lead her to a realisation of my dis-
belief in her. I knocked and she called to
me to come in.
She was as I had last seen her, but the
flowers were drooping. She looked old, in-
finitely frail, and in her poor eyes was a
look I shall never forget. The child was
dying, looking its last out of thqse spec-
tacledi eyes. She was huddled in the big
chair. But the gas fire was not alight. It
was cold in the room.
“What’s the matter? Aren’t you well?”
I asked. Then I noticed the room in dis-
array, papers strewn about, drawers pulled
from their cupboards.
A WONDERFUL FIT.
CUSTOMER: “These trousers are so tight I would never be able to get my hand into
the pockets.”
ISAACS: “Tink of der advantage, my poy. Id’s like putting your money in safe deposit."
JOURNEY’S END.
HAN (to Noah, as Ark meets Mt. Ararat with terrific bump): “Don’t be alarmed, Dad
it’s just another ‘Back to the Land’ movement."
For almost a minute she regarded me
without speaking.
“Thieves,” she said. Her voice was list-
less “I’ve been robbed. Your room was
not touched, but things have been taken
from Mr. Smith’s room. I- had the detec-
tives up. They used a key, just came _ m
the front door, and, of course, me not being
there Mr. Conolly saw them, but they
seemed to be quite at home, and he thought
they were new guests who’d taken the front
room.”
I said a number of things, but at last,
beneath that curious painful stare, I grew
silent.

Boundary Bend.
TT is built of bush timbers rough-hewn by
1 the saw; , „ „
It is miles from a township and miles trom
the law;
Its broken-down fence is half-hidden m
weeds
And the rubbish that’s left when the water
r6ccdes
From the posts where the riders once teth-
ered their steeds.
’Tis a lonely old relic of days that aie
gone,
In a place where the Murray flows peace-
fully on,
A favorite haunt of the heron and swan,
’Tis a ghostly old spot when the shadows
descend
And hide that old shanty at Boundary Bend.
Now it dozes and dreams in the shadows
alone . . .
Of the things it has seen in the years that
have flown. ' ~ , _
What tales it could tell if its walls had a
tongue
Of the days long ago when the country was
young,
Of the jokes that were played and the songs
that were sung ,
When the bushmcn assembled from near and
from far
(The bushmen that were —not the bushme.n
that are), . ' ~
To knock down their cheques in the tumble-
down bar; .
Till, broken’ and thirsty, their way they
would wend
From that crazy old shanty at Boundary
Bend!
On a flat close at hand, where the timber
was felled,
On the bank of the river, the races weie
held. ,
Ah! that was the glorious day of tlie
year!
Lashin’s of liquor and oceans of beer
Were brought to the shanty as race-day drew
near; , ,
And the stockmen and drovers and shearers
and cooks, „ , ,
And a pretty fair sprinkling ofi sharpers and
crooks,
Would turn up to battle and bet with the
books; . ~
And sometimes a squatter or two would
attend „ ,
The annual meeting at Boundary Bend.
The flag would be lowered, away they would
dash, , 1 ,
For riders and horses were reckless and
rash; . ,
They would go for their lives from the
sound of the gong,
And the fences they raced at were solid and
strong;
As with oaths and with curses they thundered
along,
Of life or of limb they took little account.
And woe to the rider who fell from his
mount!
He was lucky indeed if he lived to recount
How he fell when the Steeple was nearing
its end,
At the annual meeting at Boundary Bend.
A bushman in moleskins and tattered old
felt,
With a long ginger beard sweeping down
to his belt,
Presided as judge on an empty gin-case,
From a mound where with luck he could
view half the race,
And roar out the winner in thundering
bass,
Then an owner or trainer would tip him a
wink,
And off he would go to the bar for a drink.
And the liquor would flow, and the glasses
would clink;
There were thirsts to be quenched, there
was money to spend,
At the annual meeting at Boundary Bend.
So the meeting went on with its bets and
its brawls,
Its rows and its ructions, its protests and
fails,
Till the shadows grew lengthy and ev’ning
drew near,
And what with libations of whisky and
beer,
The judge’s decisions grew frightfully queer.
But he cared not a jot how they hooted or
cursed,
Once given his verdict was never reversed;
And lie went on contentedly slaking his
thirst
Till the crowd got annoyed, and the meeting
would end
In a willing old shindy at Boundary Bend.
Now the racecourse is closed aiid its fences
decayed,
And the men of the bush have grown sober
and staid;
And the lonely old shanty stands silent and
cold, ' i
And mourns for the men who lie under the
mould, . , , .
The hard-riding, hard-drinking bushmen ot
old.
Oh! green be the grass where those riders
are laid! - ...
Strong hands and brave hearts of a vanished
decade, <
They played out the game as the game
should be played.
And maybe they gather, when shadows
descend
In that tumbledown shanty at Boundary
Bend.
VICTORIA.

La Petty Longshanks.
BY R.W. Coulter .
THE old.salt’s face was flushed and fried
in the fat of contempt.
“Sports!” he snorted, slopping his
mug at tlie ring. around the race-result board.
“Sports! Huh ! Standin’ in a bar all day,
thirstin’ half-hours' at a stretch, waitin’ for
a long-legged, -herrin’-gutted, ansemic ’orse
to gallop half a minute, or a spindle-shanked,
tight-laced runt of a kangaroo dorg to streak
10 seconds! An’ they calls it ther Sport of
Kings! Sport!”
We sniffed in unison and in silence, know-
ing our garrulous man. He dived deep into
his pot, and, coming up, spilled his wind.
Ilis voice came calmly through the palm-
fronds of his foam-encrusted whiskers as he
continued.
“You’ve heard tell of them prehistoric
shellbacks called elephant tortoiseses?” We
nodded. “You’ve seen pitchers of ’em, I
s’pose? They stand about two foot six on
ther hoof, with an over-all measurement of
about five foot, an’ ironclad from stem to
sternpost, like > a tank, with a top speed of
about half a knot a watch.
“I was an a.b. at ther time I’m tellin’
yer about, on a coaster tradin’ between Dur-
ban and Mombasa. On this particular trip
we has to call in at Aldabra, which is a
small island off’ ther East Coast of Africa,
to take in a cargo of these here elephant tor-
toiseses for Majunga, in Madagascar, where
they was to be reshipped to some zoos an’
Ihings in Europe.
“It was there I meets Bill. Bill was
ther stockman of these bony brumbies —ther
cushiest job I ever seen. All he had ter do
was to dawdle along in front of ther herd,
lioldin’ a lettuce behind his back, an’ they
stampeded after him, like paralysed cattle
makin’ for water. Well, we hauls ’em
aboard, kickin’ an’ lashin’ their limbs about
like ther hands of a clock, an’ stows ’em in
ther well deck. Risky work, as yer might
say, but Bill had ’em in hand all right.
He’d walk about among ’em as cool as you
please, flashin’ his little lettuce like one of
them two-gun cowboys in ther pitchers.
“Bill an’ me got kinder pally on ther
trip. I liked his reckless spirits, an’ he
cottoned on' to me. Like clings to like,. yer
know. Well, one.night when we is night-
herdin’ in ther well deck, Bill springs his
little scheme.
“It seems.'he:has to wait about a month
at Majunga, till ther steamer, comes to take
ther herd on to Europe. His idea was to
make a bit er money outer the torts, as
he called ’em, .on ther q.t., whilst he is
waitin’.
“ ‘You see,’ lie sez to me, ‘these Froggies
at Majunga are a pretty mis’able lot, with
tons of splosh, an’ nothin’ to spend it on.
They sits round in ther caffies all day,
drinkin’ pinkie, which they calls Veen Roosli,
and sighin’ an’ ; moanin’ for ther flesh-pots
an’ tabbies of Gay Paree, which is ther
capitol of France. Exiles, they calls them-
selves, liPe Napoleon in St. Ilelener, or Stan-
ley Bruce in London. I feel kinder sorry
for these here French musharooms,’ sez Bill,
‘havin’ so much brass, an’ nothin’ to do
with it, so before I left on me. last trip I
arranged a sorter face mootin', a kinder
Petty Longshanks, which is ther name of
their Randwick in Paree; but instead ol
’orses, we has these here torts.’
“It seems a pretty good idea to me when
he explains all about it. It seems he’d
formed a syndikit in Majunga, which was
to have everything ready when lie lobs back.
“ ‘Froggies likes plenty of excitement,
Bill puts it, ‘and as a tort does only a
yard a minute, in a fifty yards race we gives
’em fifty minutes of thrill. Eight races
on ther card means eight hours’ non-stop
racin’, which is enough excitement for any
man.’
“Considerate, was Bill.
. “But that wasn’t all of Bill’s scheme. He
was goin’ to start tort-racin’ all over ther
world. A sorter stunt like that there niina-
chure golf.
“ ‘D’yer know,’ he sez, impressive like,
‘these torts live for about four hun’red years.
An’ they’re only found in Aldabra, an’ ther
Seyscheiles, an’ Galapagos. Now, with ther
money we gets outer this meet, we goes
to them islands, hold trials, an’ buys up ther
fastest hun’red-year-old fillies an’ colts
ther yearlin’s, so to speak. Then we’d be
jake for money-makers like Carbine, that 11
be in form for another two hun’red years.
An’ by brcedin’ from the others, them we
keeps for ther stud, we’ll have champeens
for ours kid’s kid’s kid’s kid’s kid’s stud,
an’ so on, for ther next billion million years
or so. Compree?’
“‘My oath!’ I sez, all worked up like.
‘But who’s “we,” Bill'?’
“ ‘Why, me an’ you,’ sez. Bill. ‘I want
a partner to look after ther animals whilst
I look after ther cash. You go a.w.l. at
Majunga, an’ come in with me—self-con-
tained between ourselves like. I run ther
tote, an’ you. run ther torts, see?
“Course I was on, an’ when we unloads at
Majunga I goes ashore with Bill to see a
man about a dorg. It was one ot them
Damnation dorgs, all spots, an I remembers
no more till next mornin’, when Bill wakes
me up with one of ther spots of flier d rg
wot bit me. an’ tells me ther ship has gorn
off safe without me.
“T h e n
we goes
down ther
town, an’
I sees it’s
plastered
all over
with flamin’ red post-
ers, all printed out in
French with gilt paint, an’
a pitcher of a yeller tort gallopin’
over a green splodge, with a pink an’ purple
jockey on its back.
“ ‘Pretty good, eh?’ sez Bill, admirin’ like.
‘Tlier syndicate roped in a platoon er artists
to do ’em. Yer know, artists breed like
rabbits on French soil, like poets an poli-
ticians in Aussie.’
“Bill useter run on like that, full of
brains an’ beans an’ things. .
“Down ther town Bill' interduces me to
ther racecourse an’ ther syndicate. Ther
course was a fenced grass track about eighty
yards long, with a grau’stand made of
planks on wine kegs all down one side, with
a tote about ther size of a rabbit-hutch, an’
a wine bar as big as a cathedral behind; ther
stand. Ther syndicate was, a flock of five
Froggies in top hats an’ whiskers, with a
coupla dozen kids all rigged out in patch-
work blouses to do ther ridin’. Ther torts
is all corralled ready be ther startin’ post,
so we lines ’em up an’ mounts ther jocks
an’ does a bit of rehearsin’. For two days
we trains ’em hard, me an’ Bill, strollin’
along in front of ther field, carry in’ between
us a long pole strung with lettuces, ther
torts, with ther boys up, lashin’ along after
ther greens like waterlogged derelicks in ther
doldrums. It was hard yakker; I s’pose me
an’ Bill muster walked half a mile each day.
“Bill’s idear was to run twelve torts off
first; then in ’arfa nour to start the other
twelve. The first batch would then be on
its way back to ther startin’ post, to start
again at ther end of ther next half-hour.
TOUGH LUCK!
FIRST POOR FISH: “Of course I'm happy. Why, I have the best wife in the country.”
SECOND POOR FISH: “Yes, I’d be happy, too, if mine was in the country.”
A race only took fifty minutes, yer seCj so
there was ten minutes’ grace for each held,
Consequently we had ’em on all ther time
like—not like Randwick, where you re bored
to sobs between tlier races,
“So’s there’d be no need for handicappin’
or favorism, ther jocks had to draw their
mounts outer a ‘hat at tlier startin’ post for
each race, an’ natcherly the whole thing was
a gamble, with only Bill’s tote an ther bar
sure to make a profit. Compree?
“But, you see, ther tote didn’t close till
ther torts was ten yards off ther finishin’
post, so ther Froggies, had a good half-hour
or more to size up ther form of ther mounts
as they raced, an’ bettin’ on ’em. That was
fair enough, ’cause the torts only galloped
a yard a minute, an’ they was all much ot
a muchness. So we was all set—barnn one
thing. Ther greengrocers in ther town, when
thfcy found we had to have lettuces,.bailed
us up for a hun’red franks apiece, an
nearly stonkered ther whole show. But one
of ther syndicate, a Jew bloke named Rosen-
blaum, scouted round in his car an’ bought
out ther entire stock off a Chow wot didn’t
know no better, for a cen-tom apiece. I
heard after they hung ther Chow for bein’
a \ sport ‘
'Veil, as ther Sundee papers sez, ther
great day dawned bright an’ clear, an me
an’ Bill got down to ther course jest as
ther sun popped over ther mountains. Bill
had to fix up ther tote, an’ I had to paint
numbers on ther she lbacks an’ get ’em to
« « U,er fiL “Se““ ”” 01 ’
™® for h(r h ist-iace.
My 30b was to start ther races, walk in
front of _ ther field up ther course, actin’ os
Stoopenjury Stooward like; then I judges
the finish, after which I changes me rig into
Clerk of ther Course, an’ set tlier jocks an’
mounts on their return voyage up th’ out-
side of ther course, an’ sail back meself to
start ther next race, an’ do it all oven again.
So I- was a sorter captain an’ crew of ther
Nancy Belle, like.
“Bill’s job was to . open ther. tote before
each race, leave a coupla ther syndicate in
charge, go to ther finishin’ post an’, when
I drops ther flag, he. had to wave lettuces
like mad till tlier . torts jerried and started
gbin’' for, ’em. Then lie was to chuck ther
lettuces down behind ther finishin’ line an’
go back to ther tote, to handle ther big bets.
T.wo more of ther syndicate was .on ther
gates, an’ Roseiiblaum was in ther bar. A
humdinger organiser, was Bill. Rosie was
the; only one he was frightened of welshin’,
so he 'put' him in ther bar, where ther
punters would keep him busy.
“I gets me two fields walkin’ round in
rings be ther startin’ post, with a jock in
the middle of each ring, holding a lettuce
,on ther end of a stick, an’ revolvin’ on his
own axles, so to speak. Then I goes to ther
bar an’ has a few with Bill.
“‘Truly a gay air enchantin’ scene,’ sez
Bill, poetic-like, lookin’ round at ther planks
an’ wine kegs which was ther gran’stand.
There muster been about a coupla thousand
Frenchies all racin’ an’ gibberin’ about,
wavin’ ther mitts an’ trippin’ over each
other’s whiskers, an’ bowin’ and scrapin' an’
havin’ a fine old time. An’ they was still
pourin’ in at ther gates, which had a big-
sign printed:
LA PETTY LONGSHANKS,
Entry V 005.... 10 Franks
NONG POODLES.
“That was Bill’s work. I don’t know no
French, but Bill, bein’ a Digger, could
yamma it like mad.
“It took me half an hour to get the first
race started, wot with slangwangin’ ther
jocks with Orstralian, an’ leverin’ ther torts
to tlier tapes, which wasn’t there, with a
crowbar. At larst I has ’em in line an’
drops me flag. One prad gets a flyin’ start:
he’d had his off forehoof up in tli’ air when
I drops ther flag. Fifty yards up ther
straight, Bill leaps about like a kangaroo,
wavin’ lettuces. Ther jocks scream _ like
tattooed monkeys, diggin’ their hooks inter
ther boiler-plates. Ther torts stretch out
their necks, with their eyes gogglin’ for ther
greens. Ther flyin’-start tort leaps to ther
front bo droppin’ his off forehoof an’ raisin’
his near hindleg. The rest _of the field
raise a foreleg, an’ ther field is well away.
“Excitin? My Colonial! Ther crowd
went barmy for forty-five minutes, an’ for
ther last five minutes they frorthed at tlier
whiskers, drownin’ ther thunder of ther
hoofs, each hoof hittin’ ther sod every fif-
teen seconds. I walks back’ards in front,
keepin’ a stoopenjury eye on ther jocks.
But there wasn’t no need. Bein’ a straight
course, there wasn’t no bumpin’ or inter-
ference or crowdin’ on ther rails, like you
get at Randwick, or any of them flash fishy
joints. This was good clean sport, an’
every one a trier —for ther lettuces. As for
batteries an’ things like that —well, 1 asks
you! Only a flamin’ power-house could-er
put jip inter one of them torts!
“Well, here we has ther field lollopin’
along, full steam ahead, like garbage, punts.
Ther torts knows me and does their best.
Once I trips an’ falls, an’ misses gettiir
under their hoofs be about two yards an’
two minntes. Half-way up ther straight I
hears a lull in ther storm like, an’ lookin’
round, I sees ther crowd has gorn over to
ther tote, an’ is fightin’ round ther win-
ders. I’m jest thinkin’ I’d have time for
a quick half-dozen or so at ther bar, when
they comes back an’ lets loose again, jest
like a flamin’ cyclone with a lull in ther
middle. For ther next ten minutes it was
like bein’ in a typhoon in the Timor Sea,
with a cargo of steel rails runnin’ amuck
m ther ship’s stummick. Two minutes an’
two yards from ther post I couldn’t hear
mcself think. I gets down on me hunkers at
ther finishin’ post an’ squints along ther line,
ready to judge. Two torts is a length ahead
of ther field. When they comes withm’ a
foot of ther line I’m gettin’ quite worked up
meself. One is a head a-front of th’ other,
an’ it’s even money which is ther winner.
Ther two jocks is screamin’ an’ kickin’ blue
murder, like demented patchwork quilts, an
ther torts is tortin’ flat out. Jest as ther
leadin’ tort is cornin’ up to ther line, his
jock, bein’ excited, jerks his head, like you
do a horse. The tort’s head shoots bock
under his shell, an’ th’ other’s head slides
over ther line. I jumps up, grabs ther
winnin’ jock’s arm, an’ waggles it over, his
head, like the ref. does at ther Stadium.
‘Ther winner !’ I yells. ‘No. 8!’
“ ’Course I’m stone deaf be this, an’ ther
next thing I sees is Bill screamin’ in
French, an’ stayin’ off a bunch of frothin
whiskers, wot looks like breakers on a lee
shore. They calms down in a minute,
though, as Bill parly voos to ’em, an’ they
starts to bow an’ scrape, polite-like, to me
an’ Bill. Me ears starts to pop, it’s so
quiet.
“ ‘Decision’s right, Dig,’ sez Bill to me,
‘they didn’t undercompree. Now hop along.
Next race, keep ’em on the Q.Y-’
“I gets ther jocks an’ ther thoroughbreds
movin’ back along tli’ outside of ther course,
ther torts chewin’ lettuce leaves, contented-
like, an’ ther jocks heavin’ ’em along from
astern, whilst ther punters goes back to ther
bar.
“Ther second field was all lined up ready
to slip their cables when I gets to ’em. I
flags ’em away as sweet as back pay, an’
everything goes as ship-shape as a mothers’
mcetin’ in ther Navy, includin’ ther pie-jaw.
“Bill was tickled pink. ‘Five thousand
franks gate money!’ lie tells me after tlier
race, ‘an’ about seven thousand franks
profit on ther two races. In a coupla years
we’ll buy out Inchcape an’ all ther pubs in
Sydney!’
“Well, ther third race started off all Sir
Garnet, ther punters puttin’ up their usual
performance, an’ ther jocks screamin’ like
simoons all along ther line. But about half-
way up ther straight, when they is all
runnin’ neck an’ neck,
ther fuses blows out.
One jock hops off an’
starts pushin’ from
astern. Before I could
get him back on
deck, they is all off
an’ pushin’. Then I
hears a horrible howl
like I heard once when
we was boarded by
Chinese pirates, an’ I
sees ther fence go
down, an’ ther punters
pour outer ther course
like a flamin’ tidal
wave in ther French
Revolution. I hauls
off to 100-ard immed-
jut. Most of ’em has
torn off the pickets
from ther fence, an’
planks from ther
stand, an’ they starts
leverin’ their bets
along like a bunch of
hairy Goliaps proddin’
snaiis with toothpicks.
“I couldn’t stem
ther tempest, as ther
sayin’ goes, so looks
round for Bill. He’s
standin’ on ther roof
of ther tote, an’ waves'.
I makes a break for
ther rabbit-hutch, tlier
crowd bein’ too excited
to take no notice. I
meets Bill at ther
tote door, an’ he’s got
a sack of something-
on his back.
‘Let’s do a get,’ he sez, ‘while ther goin’s
good!’ „ ,
“We scoots round ther back of ther tote,
an’ over ther fence, an drops on to Rosie,
who’s lyin’-to behind it.
“‘I zort zo!’ sez he, when he pulls his
kouk outta ther dust. ‘Halvers, an’ I gets
you out of ze hole in me car.’ Did I tell
you that he had the only car thereabouts?
No? Well, all right.
“ ‘All right!’ sez Bill, ‘blarst yer hide.
Ally, ally, mong cow, ally!’
“Rosie trots out his little Lizzie, an’ we
weighs anchor just as we hears ther crowd
gettin’ quiet an’ wonderin’, maybe.”
The old salt sighed and stopped, medita-
tively sucking his moustache.
“So you got away with the cash?” we
prompted.
“Cash?” he murmured. “Cash! Leave
me be. A few miles outter Majunga we
split ther prize money. We had about twelve
thousand franks in ther bag. Rosie took
six thousand, because we was dismasted an’
adrift in a furrin land. He took another
two thousand for salvage money, or taxi
hire, as he called it. to Tamatave, on ther
other side of ther island, where we shipped
aboard an English ship. The fare to Durban
cost us another thousand, so all we lobbed
with was three thousand mis’able franks!”
“Well that wasn’t so bad,” we consoled
—“about a hundred and forty pounds.”
The old salt turned a pale, weather-beaten
eve on us. and said simply, as an old salt
does, at times, “Ther frank in them days
went about three hun’red an’ fifty to ther
quid.”
“About eight quid?” We flourished our
mental arithmetic.
He nodded sadly, but brightened imme-
diately.
“Of course, the idea could be worked
• Bill’s big idea, I mean. Now, a little capital
: invested”
We nodded encouragingly.
“Six o’clock gents! All out!” shouted our
’ friend the barman.


INSIDE.
BY WILLIAM HATFIELD.
IN the yard shaped like a wedge of cake, a
heavy door at the pointed end and a
high railing giving a view of a narrow
strip of lawn at the other, a dozen men
stood about in twos and threes or paced
nervously up and down singly, eyes on the
ground and thoughts far away. Another
figure paced leisurely along the top of the
twenty-foot wall beyond the strip of lawn,
looked down occasionally, sauntered back
to the little blockhouse at the corner and
looked out on the world of the free. Those
down in the yard watched him, and envied
liis chance even to see outside. They were
tresh from that other world themselves,
their fate still in the balance. By some
wildest chance they, might beat the case
against them when it came up for hearing
and go forth free men again. The distorted
philosophy often voiced by the down-and-
out—“might, as well be in gaol as in such
a rotten fix’’— didn’t seem to have pene-
trated to the remand yard. Not one in there
but felt he could do remarkably well if
only he could get outside.
They discussed the pros and cons of
their particular cases with any other who
would listen, and particularly with the long-
timer in prison clothes who acted as a sort
of honorary warder in the blockhouse in
the centre, of the yard. For some unknown
reason this man’s long experience behind
bars seemed to argue great knowledge of
the law, and when he could be prevailed
upon to open the door to hand a light to
those who had cigarettes, his judgment was
eagerly sought. If after hearing the case
(for the modest fee of one cigarette) he
pronounced in favor of defendant, liis ver-
dict gave fresh courage to the suppliant.
There were two in the yard who didn’t
present their cases to him, a well-dressed,
well-set-up man of thirty, evidently making
his first acquaintance with this sort of thing,
and a pig-faced young tough who looked
like a pugilist out of training. This “Porky”
was all you like to think a criminal would
be, whereas most of the dozen looked help-
less creatures who . had drifted into that
yard on some foetid eddy and somehow
stayed behind the railings. Porky moved
through them like a shark in a fisher’s net,
too preoccupied with his own plight to
trouble about devouring them. He selected
the tall chap in the good tweeds as the most
likely companion, because he was as differ-
ent from this medley crowd as he himself,
and that despite the greater difference be-
tween the two of them.
“Make you sick, wouldn’t they, with their
wlnngeing about their miserable little police
court sentences—‘D’you think I’ll get off
with a month, or will they pop a trey on
me?*.... ‘D’you reckon I can beat it if I
stick to I was drunk and didn’t know what
I was doin’?’ Why. look at me: I start
on a cert three years from the time I was
HIGH EXPLOSIVES.
FIRST CADDIE: “How did the
bad-tempered old bloke
get on with his shot in
the bunker at the
eighth?"
SECOND CADDIE : “Cripes,
he just blasted it out!”
picked up, whether I beat the charge or
not —an’ I haven’t got Buckley’s—and am
I moaning? Give us a cigarette. Thanks.
What brings you here? Company swindlin’?
Crook bankruptcy, eh? Same thing, ain’t
it? How much d’you make? Just mizzled,
did you, and left ’em wonderin’? How
much? Coupla hundred! You oughter
smile. Wastin’ their time pickin’ you up.
Your worry! Sign up that you'll pay
a quid a week an’ out you walk.
‘What d'you do for a crust? Carpenter!
iou look like a bank manager. Dinkum,
if I seen you outside I’d bottle you as a. cert
good thing. Stiff, are you—on’y a fiver on
you when they picked you up! Well, what
you gotta growl about—a fiver for five
minutes’ work ain’t bad pay, is it? Bet you
never made that carping. It’s good business,
too, all ready money. Don’t let the mug
see you so’s he can pick you in a line-up
and you’re sweet; nobody can swear to
actual money, can he? If I’d stuck to cash
I wouldn’t ’a’ been here this time.
“It’s a draper’s joint, see, an’ Titch Willet
tells me there’s two hundred quid in the
place Sat’dy nights, so we got in through
a skylight—easy as the front door nine
to six, and off with the lid of that old can
as simple as openin’ sardines with the key.
All we got was a lot of old cash books an’
cheque-butts and fourteen bob in zacs, treys
an’ pennies. I flung ’em ail over the
joint for the sweepers. I’m leavin’ it, but
Titch says what about fur coats? So we
hooked a couple o’ dozen of ’em that looks
good—he knows where he can place ’em,
he reckons. But they turn out just • plain
rabbit, an’ this cove won’t give us more’n
a quid each for ’em.
“I let Titch have his dozen an’ reckon
1 can do better among the women. And
so I do, knockin’ ’em orf at from four to
five a pop. But women is hell, believe me.
The Dicks pick up Flash Annie an’ arst
her about her coat, an’ she squeals. Another
piece named Sybil tips me orf, an’ I go in
smoke —never went near me room, livin’
hand to mouth on drunks. Break your
heart! Fancy havin’ to knock a. poor
for a lousy three or four bob!
“Well, I stuck it out for a couple of
weeks, an’ one night I sees Sybil an’ she
tells me she’s got a mug in tow that’ll buy
a coat tor her at a tenner—she’s drummed
him it’s a sixty-guinea affair, an’ you know
how these honest coots come at a thing like
that. So I chances it around to me room
about twelve one night an’ finds everything
jake, though I’d oughter woke up when I
seen the seven of ’em left as I left ’em
meself. Anyhow, a decent bed looked good,
so I turns in, an’ I’m no sooner asleep than
there’s a row on the stairs. I into me pants
and orf for me getaway but of a window
on the roof, but. there’s a dick with a gun
on the .next landin’. ‘Put ’em up!’ he says,
I up with one hand, liangin’ on to me pants
with the other. There’s women at doorways
and everything, but he says, ‘Go on, up with
both of ’em, I’m takin’ no chances, Porky!’
“Well, you can’t blame him, ’cause I’ll
always shoot an’ they know it, but s’help me
I never thought about a gun. Hadn’t stopoed
to get it before . I scarpered. The dick
cornin’ up the stairs fixes me pants (after
he’d fixed me hands) an’ back we goes to
my room an’ all them fur coats. I think
that damned Sybil knows something about
that raid. You can’t trust women, I always
say, and anybody’ll tell you the same. Fact,
you can’t trust anybody. I wouldn’t put it
past Titch. Anyway, I’ll fix him. I can
tell ’em where they’ll get the rest of the
coats.
“No, I don’t think I will, after all; that
bloke’s good for a quid when a man gets
out. S’pose I’ll get no more’n a couple
over the coats (I never shot at anybody
this time), an’ I can appeal after three
years on ‘the key,’ so I’ll be out in five.
Give us a cigarette. (I’m lucky to be in
with you remand mob where I can nip
a weed. I’m not supposed to be in this
yard at all.
They can’t
have looked
up the ‘key’
business
yet.)”
A man
came in with
dinner, a
slab of
corned beef
and cabbage
and a potato
in its jacket,
served in a
tin dish to
each ma n,
together with
a short-
pronged fork
and a knife broken oft' and blunted to less
than two inches, and Porky’s history was left
in abeyance. Everyone, even the man in
the good tweeds, ate most of the rough meal,
though Porky growled a bit.
“Glad when I go on down to the pen,” he
said. “Do you better than in here. Look,
you’re a edjucated bloke, an’ you’ll soon
be outer this. You oughter make a shine
in the papers about the way they treat a
bloke on remand. Look, there goes the
‘engineer,’ gettin’ tried again. Don’t he
love it! Wonder if Unk acquitted him
this time? Wliat does he know, anyway?
Never breasted a charge in his life, only
wife-starvin’! That’s what he does —lives
here rather than pay his order. Wish that’d
THE THING THAT HURT.
“I hear your husband is trying to sell you to the highest bidder. But you shouldn’t
let that worry you, everyone knows what a beast he is.”
“That doesn’t worry me! What hurts is he’s had no offers!”
keep me out! What’s a coupla quid? P’raps
he don’t like her, though. Oh, here’s this
headache again!”
The “engineer” came over and nipped a
cigarette (“That fiver o’ yours ’ll go in
smoke if you’re here a week, mate,” said
Porky.)
“Listen,” said the “engineer.” “Unk says
I can beat it if I stick to it I was just
testin’ the thing for the dealer at the
garage; and, -besides, here’s the point: it
stands to reason I wasn’t pinchin’ the bike
—I don’t want it, got one o’ me own, big
American twin and sidecar. They can't make
out I was pinchin’ it, can they? Why, I
do reg’lar work for that dealer. Ain’t it
natural he says to me to give that one a
run out an’ see what it’s worth, and I go
out an’ get on the wrong bike?” He looked
appealingly from one to the other, and the
man in the good tweeds began to wonder
if the detective force needed to be
very smart, after all. Porky grinned
his contempt.
“Can’t you think up something
good to tell the Court? It was a
frame-up—the police put it in your
pocket?”
“But it’s a motor-bike I’m talkin’
about!”
“Oh, is it? I thought you said a tram.”
The “engineer” wandered away to the
chap waiting to face the Court on a charge
of indecent assault, and after patient hear-
ing of their particular cases each discharged
the other without a stain on his character.
Porky took a turn up and down the yard,
and while he was away the confidence man
with the gold-rimmed glasses and the beery
nose joined Bardell (the name will do) to
put the nips in for a cigarette. Down from
the country, this chap, from Ballarat this
time, he said.
“Not quite the right sort of town for me,
though,” he explained. “I like ’em a bit
smaller, where you can really get to know
the publican himself. It’s a good line, this
cheque stunt. Start a bit of a line —mixed
and fruit, anything will do—and get known
as a good spender. Pay everything by
cheque, for a few weeks, so as your paper
gets to be known, and change one now and
then after hours for cash over the bar. They
get to know they’re good next day always,
and then when you’re set, and there comes
a time with big money about the town, say
show or races, whip around to all of ’em
on a Saturday afternoon and put it over for
ten, twenty, or thirty, according to how
you’ve feathered it—stick it into all of ’em
quick, and do your break. It’s ten o’clock
Monday before they wake up and you’re in
the next State.”
“Sounds easy enough,” sai f l Bardell;
“what came unstuck this time?”
“It was the sifce of the town, you see.
Gives itself airs like Melbourne—barmen
and barmaids and all that. I gave the big
pub the big knock, and the boss is only a
manager, I found out. Sniffed the cheque
when he saw it was for fifty and said he’d
keep it and show the bank manager him-
self when he dropped around that evening.
Oh, a rotten, suspicious swine! Of course,
I said all right—that’s where headpiece
comes in; if I’d kicked up a fuss he’d have
dropped right away—and out I walked
unconcerned and got on the train with what
I’d lifted off the others, seventy-odd in
chicken-feed lots, tenners, and so on. And
the cow wired down and had me picked up
as I got off the train!”
“So you’re gone a million, eh?”
“Gone? Gone, you say? Not me, me
boy! I got. money in that bank, nine pound
odd. See how I work it? None of those
cheques are less than a tenner, so none of
them can be paid and clean the account
out. They’ll all be N.S.F., and the worst
they can do is send me bankrupt and divide
it between ’em. See?”
Bardell agreed that he saw, and the con-
fidence man went over to explain it to the
“engineer.” Porky came back and said,
“Did you take his cheque for the smoke?”
grinning as if he had heard something funny.
“Did he tell you of his big clean-up —
seventy quid, wasn’t it, and missed on the
fifty?”
“How did you know?”
“He tells that one every time. Never
been outer Footseray in his life, Mends
boots out there, and every time lie’s full
—and that’s every time he’s out —he tries
to put crook cheques over for drinks and
ten-bob change. That’s his dream, to get
out to Ballarat (I don’t think he knows
what State it’s in) and clean up the hay-
seeds for seventy quid—the biggest amount
of money he can think of at once. (Give
us another weed, will you, and one for in
the peter to-night—and oh, give us one for
on the way down to-morrer. Five years
before I see another real smoke.)”
The personnel of the yard had changed
greatly next day, the imperturbable
keeper of the door being practically the
only old friend. Bardell said : “I see Porky’s
gone to start his term. Tough egg, that,
eh? Fancy five years staring you in the face !”
“Five years? Did he get you, too?” The
doorkeeper permitted himself a slow smile.
“Porky doin’ five , years!” He actually
laughed. “Yes, Porky’s gone to start his
long term —seven days for drunk an’ cre-
atin’ a disturbance! Pastrycook he is,
head chef for a cove that owns a pie-cart,
an' they have a brawl every second pay-day.
He reads the court cases in the Sunday
papers and when he’s in here lie’s every
hard case you ever heard of back to Ned
Kelly. It gets him smokes off the new hands.”
Bardell grinned. “Pardon me, but wliat
are you here for? How long are you doing?”
“Fifteen years. I’ll be out now in a
month. Moved up here for release. Prac-
tically on the staff this last six months.
I gave no trouble an’ I’m getting this chance
to sort of meet fellows ‘outside’ —this is
near enough ‘outside’.”
“But what are you in for?”
“Murder. Got it brokh down from”
he closed his hand round his throat and
jerked his other thumb downward —“on the
last mornin’. Give us a cigarette.”
Late Love.
Dearest of all, if a chancy kiss
Make a plain woman care like this,
If the sun go down on a new-found pride
For a new love keen and tender-eyed,
And a wild, white passion in wonder leap
In a restless heart late lulled to sleep
After the storm of the envying
Where youth is a cruel and careless thing;
If a secret of kisses given and taken
A heart to a heart’s desire awaken,
And love discover a face is fair
When life has graven no beauty there;
If there be a rose in the desert grown,
Who finds may make the rose his own.
W.A,
ETHEL DAVIES.

anywhere.—3369.
Information Sought.
(1) To what heights are ships raised in
the locks of the Panama Canal? (2) What
is the difference between the levels of the
two oceans? —329B.
(1) From Gatun at the Caribbean end of
the Canal three pairs of locks raise the vessel
85ft. to Gatun Lake. At Pedro Miguel a
single lock lowers the vessel to Miraflores
Lake 54ft. above sea level. The descent to
the Pacific is completed by two more locks
at Miraflores. (2) At low tide the Caribbean
Sea level is 3-Jft. higher than that of the
Pacific.
(1) Best route to The Granites from
Sydney? (2) Speediest method of trans-
port? (3) Would cost of transport from
Sydney, inclusive of the necessary outfit,
exceed £100?—3145.
(1) and (2) By rail via Melbourne, Adel-
aide and Alice Springs, thence by motor.
(3) No. It should be added that prospects
are desperately poor. Many men have left
the place and others are leaving from day
to day. The “field” has been roundly con-
demned.
How to obtain a position with a radio
station (“A” or “R” class ) as an announcer?
What qualifications, besides a good speak-
ing voice, are required? Are lady announcers
employed by any of the stations? —3344.
Apply direct to the manager of the State
branch of the National Broadcasting Com-
mission, who will advise when a vacancy
occurs, and then arrange for an audition.
No vacancy at present, and a long waiting
list. Qualifications include a good know-
ledge of English, French, German, Italian
and world affairs. Some of the “B” class
stations have ladies on their announcing
staff.
(1) What is the ' difference in sail area
between Bermuda- and cutter rig for a 40ft.
yacht? (2) Is Bermuda rig as handy to
handle in a sea as the usual gaff mainsail?
(3) Any alteration required to existing
mast? (4) Would Bermuda rig do for
deep-sea fishing on a very windy coast, where
sails must often be reefed down? (5) Com-
parison of cost? —3216.
(1) Practically none. (2) No. (3)
You would have to step a Bermuda mast
with track fitted over the hounds, halyard
strops, etc. (4) Not recommended. (5)
Sails cost about the same as cutter rig, but
mast, rigging, spars, etc., are much dearer.
Is it constitutional for the Municipal
Tramways Trust (S.A.) to bar its employees
from participating in municipal elections?
—3102.
Can’t give a legal opinion on a matter
that lias never been tested. A circumstance
that has some bearing on the question is
that a bill was introduced into the Assembly
last August to enable employees of the
Municipal Tramways Trust and Metropoli-
tan Abattoirs Board to contest municipal
and district elections and to sit as members
of municipal and district councils. The bill
was passed by the Assembly, but rejected
by the Legislative Council. Copies of the
bill and of “Hansard” containing discussions
on the matter may be obtained from the
Government Printer.
How to resharpen files by means of acid
and water? —3lsB.
First clean the files with hot water and
soda and then connect them to the positive
pole of a battery, in a bath composed of
40 parts sulphuric acid and 1000 parts
water. The negative battery pole is con-
nec-ted to a copper spiral surrounding the
files but not touching them. When the
files have been in the bath for ten minutes
they are removed, washed and dried. It
the effect is not sufficient, the files may be
replaced in the bath for a further period ot
ten minutes. The vessel holding the som-
tion must be made of some material not
affected by sulphuric acid.
(1) Does the State land tax in W.A.
apply to small blocks of land in the neigh-
borhood of Perth? (2) How long has the
tax been in operation? —3ol6.
(1) Yes, at the rate of 2d. in the £ on
the unimproved value or Id. in the £1 on
the improved value, with a minimum of
2s. 6d. (2) Since 1907, but there was an
exemption up to £5O prior to 1924. Since
then all land is liable to taxation.
The Vie. Railway Act provides that after
goods have been discharged from- trucks the
Railway Department is responsible only as
bailee for damage or loss. What is a bailee's
liability in such cases? —336s.
The Commissioners must take care of the
goods without negligence. If, for instance,
damage occurred while the staff was on duty,
this- might be negligence, but if a shed
were broken into after hours and goods
were stolen, the Commissioners would not
be responsible.
Recipe for a quick-drying footpath paint?
—3187.
Mix 1 part cement and 3 parts very fine
sand, and incorporate dry color in powder
form. Mix with water, damp the path,
and apply with a trowel or flat board. If
a very smooth surface is required, sprinkle
dry cement and color mixed together over
the wet surface of tho trowelled layer, and
smooth off carefully. Ready-mixed paving
paint will cost you less and give a better
finish.
(1) How to clean oak furniture which,
in addition to other dirt, is marred by ink-
stains? (2) How to brighten up dark maple
furniture whieh has been scratched and lost-
some of its polish? —3l6s.
(1) For removing ink-stains see B.
16/11/.’32, p. 27. To clean oak furniture,
dust it well and, if there are crevices or
carvings, remove dirt with a pointed piece
of soft wood. Mix olive oil and vinegar
in equal parts, shake well, and apply to
the furniture with a flannel; this cleans
as well as polishes. Finish with a dry
woollen rag and rub to a bright polish.
(2) If French-polished, restore scratched
places with, a little brown stain followed by
a touch of shellac dissolved in methylated
spirit, and rub up with raw linseed oii used
sparingly and polished until all trace of
oil disappears. If not French-polished,
apply the methods advised in (1).
A writer in a Sydney weekly mentions
a bird called the spine-tailed log-runner.
What is it like and how did it get its name?
—3233,
It is mottled, brown and black above,
with yellowish-white on the breast; the male
has the throat white, in the female it is
pale chestnut. The tail is rather long,
and the shaft of each tail-feather is con-
tinued as a spine beyond the barbs. The
legs and toes are very long- and stout for
the size of the bird (which is not much
larger than the willy-wagtail) ; it uses
them for scratching away leaves and sticks
beneath which it finds its food. The name
“log-runner” is not specially appropriate,
as the birds keep entirely to the ground
and move by hopping rather than running.
The curious form of the tail seems to have
no relation to the bird’s habits. In other
birds with similarly modified tail-feathers
the tail is used to support them when
climbing trees (woodpeckers) or clinging to
cliffs (spine-tailed swifts),
(1) Recipe for paste suitable for repaper-
ing walls? (2) How should the walls be
treated' before papering?— 3294.
(1) One gallon of boiling water to 21b.
flour and loz. alum; is a common proportion.
The thinner the; paste can be made the
better. Strain before using. (2) The old
Paper must be stripped off and the walls
scraped, washed, stopped, pumiced and sized.
I xvant to do some pictures to decorate the
walls of a cafd. (1) Cheapest material to
do them on? (2) How can they be attached
to the walls so that they will look as if
painted on them? —3234.
(1) Decorators’ cloth, or sign writers’
calico, mounted in the ordinary way and
given a coat of strong glue size. Follow
with a priming of ochre-tinted lead thinned
with one-third oil and two-thirds turpen-
tine. Sandpaper when dry, and paint sub-
ject in flat oil colors. (2) Cut from
stretcher when dry and attach to walls
with a paste made of 11b- of glue in two
gallons of water. Add to it while boiling
-Jib. caustic soda, 11b. sulphate of ammonia
and enough plain flour to thicken. Strain
and add while warm 1 pint of Venice
turpentine. Apply to back while lukewarm
and roll into place with a paperhanger’s
roller. Leave for a few days and apply a
coat of corn-starch' size to the painting,
which will take on the surface of ordi-
nary kalsomine walls.
How can I stain wood so as to leave a
pattern in relief in the natural color of
the timber? —3235.
Smooth the surface of the wood with fine
sandpaper and pumice stone and transfer
the design with carbon paper. Paint the
portions of the design to be finished un-
stained with shellac dissolved in methylated
spirit. When this is dry stain the whole
piece in two or three thin coats. Leave
for 24 hours and go over the entire surface
with a soft rag soaked in methylated spirit.
Keep on rubbing gently until 1 all the shel-
lac with which the pattern was painted,
including the superimposed stain, has been
removed. Finish' with linseed oil. Such
work can only be done successfully on fine-
grained hardwoods.
Way of treating white pine walls to pre-
serve their natural c010r? —3194.
Brush down the walls to remove dust,
stop all nail-holes or cracks with putty
tinted to match the wood, then apply raw
linseed oil. Use no more than the wood
will absorb cleanly, and rub to a dry finish
with a, stout cloth.
fl) Where was the first Light Horse or
Cavalry Corps formed in N.S.W.; title,
strength, uniform and how armed? (2)
Were similar units in existence in Vic. at
the same period or previously? —2BB7.
(1) In 1856 the Sydney Volunteer Force
had a troop of cavalry. It dropped out in
1858. Ini 1860 a troop of Mounted Rifles was
raised which was disbanded in 1862. No
details in regard to the uniform and arms of
these units can be traced. In 1885 the Syd-
ney Light Horse was formed; it exists to
this day as the N.S.W. Lancers. The uni-
form consisted of blue tunics, overalls, short
boots, box spurs and white belts. Blue
peaked caps with red bands were worn, and
the unit was armed originally with sword,
afterwards with lance. In 1886 the Upper
Clarence Light Horse was raised. Full-
dress uniform was white helmet with red and
white plume, scarlet tunic with silver braid
and buttons, blue overalls, double red stripe,
white cross-belt, sword belt and slings and
black Wellington boots with box spurs;
undress, blue pill-box cap with silver braid,
blue patrol jacket, light-colored tight cord
breeches and brown leggings; arms, Martini
Henry carbine and cavalry sabre. Similar
corps were formed about .this period at
Grafton and on the Murrumbidgee ; in 1893
they were all brigaded with the Lancers and
renamed Mounted Rifles. In addition in
1.888 the Corps of Permanent Mounted
Infantry of one officer and 31 men was
raised at Sydney; disbanded in 1890. (2)
In Victoria similar units existed at about
the same periods. In 1856 the Yeomanry
Cavalry Corps was formed, and in 1863 the
units of this corps were amalgamated under
the title of Prince of Wales’s Victorian Vol-
unteer Light Horse. Members were dressed
as hussars, and the uniform was blue with
scarlet busby badge and white plume. In
18S2 there were troops at Melbourne, Kyne-
ton, Castlemaine, Ballarat, Sandhurst and
southern centres. Details as to arms are
lacking. For further information see “Aus-
tralian Cavalry,” by Frank Wilkinson, and
“A Short History of the N.S.W. Rifles.”
Is it possible to make P.O.P. prints with-
out a running water supply? —3ls2.
You can’t do it without water if you
want permanent prints, but you can save
water by using one of the hypo eliminators
on the market.

3081.—T0 make water-skis: Sharply-
tapered floats are constructed of a length
14in. longer than your height, or Bft. for a
man weighing 1501 b.; beam is 15in. Best
material is sheet aluminium alloy. Divide
each float into two compartments length-
wise with another sheet of aluminium,
which is continued below the hull as a keel
4rc. long and 6in. deep. Attach 6in. by 6in.
hinge plates to the keel horizontally, one on
either side, with stops on the fin to prevent
them from going beyond the vertical when
the ski moves backward. Reinforce the
whole with aluminium bulkheads inside. For
steering and stopping, a long-shafted paddle
is necessary. Any saddler will make up
tne binding straps, which are similar to
those on snow-skis.—J.

“demand” means payable immediately... .F.P.:

Simon’s Lodestar.
IN Bethlehem —but, oh, so long ago !
Old Simon sat outside the grey inn's
door
Watching the passers-by and muttering o’er
Enchanted words that made his old eyes
glow;
And though folks questioned as to what he
said
He only smiled and shook his hoary head.
Year in, year out, the shepherds drove their
flocks
Out to the hills around the Heaven-blessed
town,
To herbage growing ’midst the limestone
rocks,
Whose fathers watched the guiding star
look down ;
And Simon saw them come, and saw them
go,
With ever in his eyes that radiant glow.
In solitude he climbed the noiseless height
By keeping captive in his heart a star.
Whose radiance flooded all his life with
fight,
The glory cov’ring every earth-born scar,
Hugging his secret with a miser’s zest —
The lodestar of his life—within his breast.
“What dost thou say?” the strangers there
would asK;
But unto all. his answer a smile;
And though they knew he used it as a mask,
They could not penetrate his simple guile ;
And those from Antioch and distant Rome
Spoke of the strange old man when back at
home.
He sits no more outside the grey inn’s door,
For angels helped him climb the golden
stairs ;
And yet, methinks, he loves to mutter o er
From one of Heaven’s spacious old arm-
chairs
The words on ! earth he murmured night and
morn:
“/ built the stable in which Christ was
bom!”

If All Our Days.
IF all our days and all our years
Are but blown leaves before November's
Mortal wind, and none remembers
Aught of us, what mean these tears V
We dream : and are our visions less
Than blind, unmeditating fate's
instinctive loves, instinctive hates
Known to the dark-souled lioness,?
We strive: our battle is with Time.
Are we but leaves that will be blown
In season? We have raised and known
Altars and ministries and rhyme.
If all our days and years arc lost
And fallen with corrupting flesh,
We shall not pass and wholly perish
In any temporal holocaust.
Did all the nameless race of men
Who tilled these fields and hewed and strove,
And shaped this scene with voiceless love,
Utterly die and vanish then?
There is a virtue in the toil
Of humblest men, a living seed
Of more than the immediate need,
That is the chrism of the soil.
The tiger and the swallow pass.
The lily fades, the blackbird sings
And dies; and all these natural things
Are windy shadows in the grass.
But man who, bowed and sweating, strives
Beyond his strength, in a half-light,
Sees a strange star above the night,
Knows something from his striving lives.

The Passing Wind.
T MUST go back to some place _
1 Where the cuckoos will remain,
To fill the fragrant summer with frag-
rance of their pain;
To fill the air with longing’s irresolute
refrain.
I must go back and find them.
(They passed beside my door,
And why they went or whither
I shall know nevermore —
The quest they pleaded sorely,
The dream they suffered for.)
But in my blood, eternal,
Beats, beats an ancient quest,
The dreaming of far beauty
At destiny’s behest:
So deep and dire in longing;
So splendid in unrest.
And echo, and the cuckoos,
The;passing wind and I
Must cry it in the dawning,
Must cry it in the sky;
Must cry it, and for ever,
And never cease to cry.
I must go back to some place
Where the cuckoos will remain,
To fill the fragrant summer with cadence
of their pain.

“And the Road Unknown.”
N<) \V that my life is lialf-way over,
What have I won from its ruthless
hours V
That dawn beguiles with dew on the clover,
That noon strews dust on .the opened
flowers,
That eve robs color, and Darkness lowers.
Dreams are pleasant, but dreamers waken
Into the grey from the cheat of gold;
Hones and faiths, they have all been taken,
Shed leaves tossed as the years unrolled.
The Dark draws closer, I feel its cold.
Now that my life is almost ended,
No gleam of guidance may I discern.
Groping a way as tlie path descended,
Just when it seems I have learned to
learn —
The teacher is Darkness, taciturn.
Sequence on noons and night-stars arching
Lead to the last appointed date.
Into the Dark I am marching, marching,
Helpless and inarticulate.
But what if the Dark should hide a Gate?

ELSIE COLE.
Leonarie.
ITOOK me half a hundred, half a hundred
years,
And hied away afoot from the long-light
glen.
The land it was my Marathon, the sea it
was my pond ;
I hurtled and I havened till the five
times ten.
Heigh-ho, Leonarie!
I sowed the seeding years on the meadow and
the scaur—
The moon-reaped wheat for the moon-
drawn wain !
A-Grailing, a-sailing, I sowed upon the deep ;
Foam for their furrowing, they came no
more again.
A farer, a forayer on many a robber keep.
My merry men a-march to the bugle and
the breeze,
A Avinner and a loser in many a toss with
Fate,
To the land’s end came I, 'and the un-
reaped sea’s.
“O can it be the land’s end, O can it be the
sea’s,”
I said, “for yet the sap runs, the foray
is unwon?”
The old amphitheatre upon the plain of
Time
Is all set for Troy-fall; the merry masque
is done.
There are dooms in the levin, there are gods
on the wind,
All a-wing for Troy-fall, and I would sec
the end.
Is there not a dance left with marish-maid
fire?
A purse of moony moidores to barter and
to spend?
I will up and go then, and set the clock of
Time
Back to the bright dawn of forty years
and ten.
SAvord I then, or sleep then, my heart’s
a-fire to go
Back to beg the blessing of the long-light
glen.
Heigh-ho, Leonarie!
The gates were all a-quiver of granite and
of pearl,
They shimmered me a welcome or e’er I
stepped unto
The long fair reaches of argent and of
brown
That cradled me in quiet below the
mother-blue.
I said, “Is that the poplar I planted young
and fair?
It leans to the Avest with a cleft into its
heart,
And its crown of yelloAV eld were a high
king’s grace:
O brother, brother, brother, were I crowned
as thou art!”
The royal, leaning poplar it called a merry
wind,
Quick as any star-fall, and wrought a
yellow rain,
And each brown sister at peace upon the
mould
Leaped from her Lent into carnival again.
Whirling and twirling, as, mad with sap
again, *
The sweet ghost-carnival it rained the
wizard tree,
For every leaf a day Avas, a tourney day
Avith Fate;
And throned Austral April, her meed was
unto me.
I said, “I have the blessing of the long-light
glen,
A-Grailing. a-sailing—O grace be for the
Star!”
The meed of halted tourney beneath the
wizard tree,
Man-alone, I take it for one that lies afar.
Heigh-ho, Leonarie!

Hard Light.
RESTING with eyes half-closed,
Perhaps I dozed,
And dreamt these years—
The ? r smears
Of lazy emotion ; moods of exile, whence
Arises callous laughter for defence -
The naked little black despairs that fetched
(When whipped) sharp acid for the outlines
etched
Upon the metal surface of the days:
And weak impatience, lured until it stays.
But when I rise and stumbling gc i
Outside, the sunlight deals me a sudden blow
Full in the face.
All trace
Of dreaming vanishes: beyond the sheer
Descent of cliff through jungle, I can hear
Faint ripples of slack water; nothing
escapes:
Hard light cuts clear the edges of all shapes:
Vines knotting hangman’s loops above a
chasm;
Streaked currents on the sea; the cringing
spasm
Of shoals in awe of boulders knuckled white
As when a fist is clenched to fight;
Sprawled banyan boughs dropping incestuous
Root-tendrils to the earth; the smothering
fuss
Of undergrowth, where canes reach up their
drowned
Thin arms; bright bougainvillaea draped
around
A slender palm—all these and more
Evoke this vivid shore,
Which, smiling in excessive light, appears
As when the mouth of beauty sneers.
All men at last confess
Life’s ultimate bitterness,
Blinking before the one
Great transmigration of oblivion.
The world’s affairs are, bones gnawed bare,
Bleached white at last,
Strewn here ahd there
Along the past.
Much more abiding things
Are water, leaves and wings
Of flying birds: perpetually they
Are of the light of day,
Brusque symbols of the universal state,
Secret and unregenerate.
So I no less must stand revealed
Unhealed,
However I may hide my face
In the grasses and grace
Of the earth, as a child might smother
Small griefs in the lap of its mother... .
This earth, which in the socket of the sky,
Rolls round as if it were a madman’s eye.

Cloaks.
LONG black cloaks that the Spaniard
wore, or the silver cloak of a queen,
Cloaks that ruffled in crimson pride, and
cloaks that hurried in green;
Cloaks that slid to a tryst by night, cloak
of a gallant gay;
A broidered cloak with a diamond clasp,
where a hidden dagger lay—■
They have softly swept o’er a marbled floor,
, they have waved in an April breeze
When the kestrel sprang from a
wrist to soar o’er the castle trees;
They have wrapped a babe in its dewy sleep.
they have hung so straight and still
Where its father slept—with his broken
sword —alone on a fire-scarred hill;
They have veiled a bride from her bride-
groom’s eyes, to be caught away with a
laugh; .
Have been gathered close round the holy
man as he journeyed with scrip and
staff.
The poet pacing the boulevard spread his
faded blue cloak wide
That the barefoot gamins of Paris streets
from the bitter wind might bide.
The cardinal’s cloak his secrets hid, and the
fate of a foolish king,
It trailed behind like a peacock’s tail as
men kissed the cardinal’s ring.
And none could tell what the churchman
thought, but a little mouse awoke
And suddenly from the arras ran for his
share of the cardinal’s cloak;
And the pontiff smiled, and, glancing down,
cried: “A parable I see—
The mouse has run from a monarch’s wall to
a sanctuary with me.”
Gipsies’ cloaks that are frayed and worn,
orange girls’ with their tippets red;
A bean-brown witch with her flying cape on
a broomstick overhead;
A fairy’s mantle of moth-wings made where
the dewdrops hang like pearls,
And the fluttering cloaks on the trodden
grass of the ripe-lipped Irish girls;
The honored cloak that a lover spread for
the feet of a wilful queen
To keep her shoes from the city mud —yet
more wise had Raleigh been
To spread his cloak where her sly soul
moved, before the world had sight
Of the Royal malice that stained the soul,
if the haughty feet were white!
Life gives us all a cloak to wear —of motley
or of rue;
Here Love has mended a gaping rent, or Hate
with its dirk thrust through.
Costly cloak for the mighty man, and a
modest for the small —
But the cloak of laughter a sad heart wears
is the bravest of them all !
QUEENSLAND.

Life’s Garden.
AGNES and Madelon,
Flowers in a garden,
Through the fierce summer sun
Watched the ground harden;
Passed through the golden hours,
Silently waiting,
Seeing their sister flowers
Loving and mating;
Waiting the splendid chance,
Love and its glory,
Heroes of Old Romance
Fabled in story.
Colder the sea wind blew,
Muttered the thunder,
Withered leaves drifted to
Browner grass under.
Agnes and Madelon
Sleep in the garden;
It troubles not anyone
How the plots harden.
They had ineir dream.
With no after-revealing
Of heartache or sorrow
Its loveliness stealing.

The Blackbird Singing.
WHEN the pale light is waning
And the west is burning,
“Returning,” sings the blackbird,
“Returning—returning!’’
Up in the tea-tree
Where the dead leaves glitter,
And the plump, purplish sparrows
Preen themselves and twitter —
Deep in the shadows
Where the boughs drip gold.
And the tall, fronded bracken
Roofs the leafy mould —
Loud sings the blackbird,
Sweeter carols spurning,
“Returning,” sings the blackbird,
“Returning—returning!”
Not another thing
Will the blackbird sing;
Only that one word
In a dubious refrain;
Through the leaf-barred sunshine,
Through the tinkling rain-
“Returning, returning, returning,”
Again and again.
What is returning, blackbird?
Is it the Spring?
The earth is awake, and the willows
Shake silk from each string.
In the drowned silver pastures
The blue peas are in bud;
The pond-weed is lifting
Above the tideless flood.
In the wide, sunny spaces
Roams the restless bee
And scents of spilled-out honey
Drift down toward the sea.
Dim gold is in the hollows,
New birds are on the wing;
It is Spring that’s returning—
It is Spring, it is Spring!
When the pale light is waning,
And the west is burning,
••Returning,” sings the blackbird,
“Returning—returning!”

MYRA MORRIS.
The Abyss.
THE little town is built upon the lip
Of the abyss;
By the clay wall where the sheer pebbles slip
Pairs lean and kiss.
She flips a gift-flower into dreadful space;
Her laughter goes,
Tiny and transient as her flower-small face.
After the rose.
And children scold at eyeless dolls of wood.
Nurse torn fur-toys;
Above their heads there’s talk of bad and
good,
Losses and joys.
From that thatched steeple at times sounds
a bell;
Some laugh, some pray ;
The milch goats bleat ; deeper than any hell
Space drops away.
Bluer than any heaven the depth seems ;
Pin-points of light
Stray there when darkness brings the times
of dreams....
Dropt stars of night?
Or fireflies in a slowly-wandering swarm?. ..
The lovers lean
On the clay wall, seeking heart-omens warm
In star-dust sheen.
Star-dust. Star-dust. Pollen of worlds or
flowers ?
The thin bell cries;
Goats bleat; we lean out from this life of ours
Where all sound dies.
The rock that bears us lifts from the abyss
With our toy town,
Fruit trees and poison-herbs, brief lips that
kiss,
Black priest, white clown.
Like a stayed cloud it stands in sapphire
space,
Form born of nought:
The void that shapes a fire-world or a face,
A moon, a thought.
So, as a rose is tossed across the clay
Of love’s slight wall,
The chasm’s nameless will to save or slay
Appoints its fall.

Dad Goes to Church.
BY STEELE RUDD.
I TELL you the seasons ha’ changed!”
Dad declared stubbornly when the
drought had raged for over a year and
the last of the hay was being fed to the
stock, and the silo was empty, and the dairy
herd was pretty empty, too —the weaker ones
had been dying day by day.
“An’ changed for th’ worsh, so them
have!” Maloney, who had come to seek
neighborly help, spluttered dejectedly. “An’
if y’ can’t spare me tli’ lind of another little
load of hay f’rm what ye have left, Rudd,
if ’tis only a barrowful, to kape life in them
few milkers o’ mine for another week should
th’ rain come by then, God help us, ’twill be
tli’ last chance for them, an’ for myself,
too!”
“Well, all th’ hay that’s here now,
Maloney,” Dad answered philosophically,
“won’t keep any of them alive for more’n a
week, and they might hang out that long
without it, so yours might as well have some
of it.” Dad generally knew what he
was driving at; but it wasn’t always easy
for anybody else to be sure.
“Yet I don’t know, Father,” Mother
reasoned when Dad came inside out of the
heat, after having had his hand nearly
shaken off in gratitude by Maloney. Long-
before this came on, and we were having-
good seasons and doing well, you never went
to church once, you know! And perhaps
if you had”
Dad raised his bowed head so suddenly
and glared so hard that Mother faltered for
a moment. But as he didn’t speak she con-
tinued gently:
“If you had gone once now and again,
Father, it might—it might have been better,
no one knows.”
“If I had gone to church, Mother?” Dad
asked, frowning.
Mother nodded nervously. _
“You think it would ha’ rained if I had i
Mother nodded again.
“Well, why didn’t it rain for Anderson
and Grey? They never miss a chance of
goin’ to church. And for Maloney? He s
never done prayin’. He prayed all over me
just now for lettin’ him have, a bit more
hay—as if I was a’ Almighty.”
“But if everyone went it might be dif-
ferent,” Mother suggested. “And it would
do no harm to go, Father.”
Dad lowered his eyes in thought.
“And it was just after he started going
to church that Dave got the job he has,
Mother remembered. “And I hope, he keeps
it up when he comes home again.’
“It’s all right for Dave, Mother,” Dad
conceded; “he’s young, an’ has a lot to
learn, an’ has nothin’ to worry about—no
interest to pay; no seed rottm’ m th
ground ; no stock dyin’ on him!”
“And perhaps he might never have if he
keeps to goin’ to church” —from Mother.
“Why, you’re gettin’ religious as any of
’em,” Dad drawled, looking closely at her.
“No, not religious; but in times like now
when everyone wants to keep courage”
“It’s dern hard to keep courage when y’
can’t grow nothin’, Mother,” Dad inter-
rupted. “An’ everythin’ around is dead,
an’ what ain’t soon will be.” He paused.
“Still, you an’ me,” he agreed, “ain’t been
to church overmuch since we wer’ married
together, old woman.”
“There’s been little chance here in the
bush,” she defended —“and very little time.
There was no church to go to till lately.”
“Th’ parson came to see us every year
at Shingle Hut, though,” Dad remembered.
“An’ you only had one scone to give him
APPEARANCES WERE AGAINST HIM.
CAMEL: “I've not had. a drink for a week.”
DONKEY: “What, with a nose like that!”
for dinner once when he come on a’ old
horse, an’ he could ha’ eaten a whole leg
o’ mutton to himself.” A twinkle came
into his eyes.
“And Joe had gobbled half of it,’’ Mother
smiled, and for a moment Dad’s big frame
shook in noiseless mirth.
“Ah, me!” Mother sighed, as her thoughts
went back to the struggles of the past.
“If there wasn’t any parsons,” Dad re-
newed, “people would have plenty churches,
same as they have barns. Parsons are stoo-
pid. They come from readin’-rooms, an’
tea parties in th’ city, an’ know nothin’
about th’ bush. Callin’ at homes, palaverin’
with th’ women, an’ bellerin’ out an’ moanin’
an’ mopoken, th’ way ’em do, ain’t prayin’
for people!”
“Oh, they pray beautifully, some of them,
Father,” Mother corrected.
“Not th’ way th’ Sav’or said you was to
pray,” Dad maintained.
Mother stared wonderingly at him.
“He said you wasn’t to make a fuss about
it,” Dad went on, “but enter inter some
place, a barn maybe, or a shed, an’ shut th’
door an’ pray quiet-like, sayin’ ‘Our Father
who be in Heaven, hallowed to Thy name.
Thy king’om come’ —an’ all tli’ rest, what-
ever it be, till y’ end in ‘Amen.’ ”
The look on his face and the solemn
intoning of his voice surprised Mother. He
had never appeared so
religious to her before.
“We got plenty of
it one time when we
was boys,” he inform-
ed her. “But we was
never al’ays at it, like
Maloney Still, if
to go to church’ll
bring a change—well,
you and me can give
it a try, Mother.”
A sudden downpour
of rain couldn’t have
made Mother look
more cheerful.
$ * #
Sunday; a week
later. The monthly
church service was to
be held that after-
noon, and all of us
were hustling to at-
tend—all except Dad
and Dave. Dave was
still away helping to
shift stock, and Dad
seemed absent-minded.
His thoughts were all
on the weather, for
the wind was blow-
ing, the trees sway-
ing violently, the dust
rising and clouds
banking up.
“W ell, I don’t
kn o w,” he mused.
“The rest of you go.
It might be as well if
I stayed home. Th’
rain is goin’ to
come, I believe, this
time, an’ if th’ house
lets it in—an’ th’ roof
al’ays leaks for a
while after a long dry spell—it would be
better if I wer’ here.”
“It will hardly rain, though, before night,
Father,” Mother pleaded. “And you pro-
mised to go to see if it w r ould make a differ
ence. I’m sure it will. And what does if
matter if the rain does come in? The
little harm it would do would be nothing
to the good it would do to everything out-
side.”
“ ’M! Well,” Dad said thoughtfully,
“there’s plenty time yet—we’ll see. But it
wer’ never more like rain.” And standing
at the door he looked out to see if any drops
were falling.
“I’ve put a clean shirt and your tweed
trousers on the bed for you,” Mother added,
“And soon as dinner is over we 11 go, if the
buggy is ready.”
“It’ll be ready,” Dad mumbled. “But tli’
old mare’ll never be ready to pull it back if
it rains.”
When the hour for starting arrived Dad
climbed clumsily into the buggy beside
Mother, who was all smiles, and tug-
ging at the reins he ordered Gypsy to “get
up.”
As they rolled and bumped leisurely along
the grassless lanes, past Grey’s, Anderson’s
and other homesteads, there was nothing to
be seen but dusty cropless cultivation
a
church, Dad suddenly put out his hand and
asked Mother if she’d felt any drops.
Mother hadn t, but she deemed it forgiv-
able, even though she was on her way to
church, to say she really believed now that
she had.
Dad seemed to turn ten years younger in
as many minutes. Urging Gypsy to her
best efforts, he cheerfully prophesied a
ducking for her and a stiff pull througn
the mud before she got home. _
Inside the church-paddock, set round with
“ornamental” trees, leafless and languishing
for water, the waiting congregation, beating
the flies off with their hands, were collected
in groups—some standing discussing the
weather, others sitting silently in the shade
of the building thinking weather.
NO GENTLEMAN.
“What did you give that fellow a hiding for, Jacky?”
“Catching me with his missus."
“Hello !” old Anderson called in surprise
as the buggy squeezed through the open
gate. “Here’s Rudd!” And young Ander-
son, standing beside him, chuckled: ‘No
wonder it’s gettin’ like rain!”
Dad, when lie had alighted, went round
them all, sympathising with them, hearten-
ing them, reckoning it was no good worrym’
about things—he’d seen lots of droughts as
bad, and worse, but had never known one
that wasn’t broke up by rain.
Inside the church he sank down heavily
and broadly between Mother and Sarah,
squeezing them on either side against Mrs.
Thornton, a thin woman with a baby, and
old Barden, a wrinkled adherent with a bald
crown, balanced uncomfortably on the
extreme end of the hard seat.
The parson appeared and began the service,
while Dad cocked his ear to the ceiling and
listened for sounds of rain. When he
couldn’t detect the welcome sound he became
anxious and, nudging Sarah, whispered her
to go out and see if any was failin’.
Sarah, not hearing distinctly, thought lie
required more room, and quietly shoved her-
self against old Barden, who slipped off the
end of the seat.
“Th’ singin’ must have sent him to sleep,
Dad mumbled to Mother after the victim
had collected himself and, scowling accus-
ingly at Sarah, retired to a seat further
back.
Then Dad whispered again to Sarah, this
time loud and distinct.
“I think it must be,” shp whispered
back.
He sighed gladly, and cocked his ear again
to the ceiling, throwing a glance behind at
intervals to see if rain was blowing in at
the door.
Not,till the preacher reached the “third
part” of his sermon did Dad give him all
his attention. Then he leaned forward list-
ening till he heard: “Girdle yourselves in
faith, be patient and meek, for not only will
rain descend on the parched earth to replen-
ish the fields and the barns, but wickedness
and sin will depart; the wolf shall dwell
with the lamb; the cow and the bear shall
feed together, and the lion eat straw like
an ox.” At that Dad straightened up,
stared out of the corner of his eye at
Mother, glared hard till the service con-
cluded, and went out with the rest looking
as if he wasn’t sure whether he was alive
or not.
The clouds had vanished; the sky was
blue; the wind had gone down, and there
wasn’t the faintest sign of rain.
“Well, well,” Mother sighed in sympathy
with Dad when they had climbed back into
the buggy. “Who would have thought it
would clear so quickly!”
“It wouldn’t have cleared if we had stayed
at home!’’ Dad growled. “It wanted to
rain, and was rainin’ ’fore we went in!”
Mother deemed it tactful to remain silent;
and while Gypsy breasted the collar and
jogged along the road, no more was said
till Ruddville came into view.
Beersheba.
j I/HERE Gaza sprawls in the autumn
yfV haze that purples the pastures lean,
Where old Beersheba’s turrets blaze
and Hebron steeps glow green,
We trekked through the late October dags
in the fall of ’seventeen.
Through the evening’s clouded amber light,
from the Ch lizzie’s bed of rubble,
From the flood-scoured aisles the extended
files rode southward into the shrouded
miles
Like a voiceless multitude in flight on a
blighted waste of stubble.
Three parching days round the Turkish flank
with meagre ration of sleep,
While three suns travelled the sky and
raided the toiling ranks on the waste
paraded,
Scourging the march of squadrons jaded,
kindling the desert blasts a-sweep !
A breathless night to the dawn succumbed ;
a dust-fog quilted the morn.
While purpose fluttered and doubt was mut-
tered a field gun crashed and a Hotch-
kiss spluttered.
Then sudden the lancing sunrays plumbed the
murk of a space forlorn,
Starting the shell-burst smoke ablaze from
Tel-el-Saba Hill,
Which spoke defiant and loud and clear,
lashing the ridges bowed and sere,
Scattering spoil for shroud and bier and
the starlit watches still.
Shod troops of the Desert Mounted Corps
foregathered on Abdul’s flank,
His redoubts, manned for stubborn stand,
assailed by the men of Maoriland,
Whose creeping tide in the tempest bore
through the shrapnel, rank on rank,
Dread hour by hour ’neath the nickel blast
on a sunfired day accurst;
Stormed low to cover, on breast and knee—
the mounts, reined each to its number
three,
Pawing the rear incessantly in the anguished •
throes of thirst.
The sun burned low on the battleground
where the Hebron uplands curve,
The attack delayed, and its zeal betrayed—
till the marshalled lines of Grant’s
brigade
Came trooping over the stony mound which
covered the last reserve.
A call from the voice of high command:
“Push /on, all speed from the east!”
The squadrons moved in the evening light,
now stride by stride with the dread
day’s fight
To death —or water at fall of night for
succor of man and beast!
Two regiments in a hell-matched race, the
sweep of a mighty field,
A thundering pack on a fenceless track with
flanks wide-flung in a mad attack;
Long, galloping lines that stormed apace
with bayonet blades to wield!
Flint-fire on hoofs and the whine of lead, the
rush of a deadly rain
Repelled them not nor the speed of them, for
staunch till death was the creed of them.
And triumph followed the lead of them in
a flight too swift for pain.
What was an empty saddle there, or the
headlong plunge of a horse?
A flying kill or a bloody spill while tumult
raged from the ambushed hill
At a crowded finish, past compare, fought
out on a trench-gapped course?
A pounding rush and a double leap, hoofs
brushing the Turkish steel!
Astride and afoot and hand to hand, their
blood renewing the ravaged sand,
They fought and won to the Promised Land
’neath the guns’ last thunder peal.

MEN AMONG
PEARLS.
by
H. Drake-Brockman
CAHPTER I.
Outside.
A SINGLE hurricane lantern gave little
enough light for even the tiny cabin
so close to the water that the waves,
gurgling along the sides of the lugger,
sounded to Chris as if the sea itself had
crept in and taken possession. Chris lay
in the diver’s bunk. He could never bring
himself to like doing it, but on the other
hand he could hardly start making a fuss
over what was an established custom
amongst the men of the pearling fleet when-
ever they called upon each other; so he
endeavored to forget that nightly a much-
brilliantined Japanese head reposed where
his own now lay. Certainly, custom or not,
it would have been difficult for a visitor to
find any other corner wherein to squeeze
his person.
Chris lay with his head in shadow, what
light there was gleaming on the pages of
months-old periodicals as he turned them
over. From time to time he glanced across
to where Horton, his host of the moment
and owner of the lugger, crouched towards
the lantern, cross-legged and uncomfortable
in his own bunk. Bunk? A mattress on
the decking retained by a single board!
He watched Horton’s big fingers fumbling;
a tip of tongue, working in sympathy with
the hands, showed pink as a dog’s against
the unshaven tan of dark cheeks; and
brightly there glinted, with every move-
ment, incredible exotic rings of gold em-
bedded in the lobes of weather-beaten ears.
But Chris did not speak; only the voice
of the sea, persistent, and the sharp rasp
of the file in Horton’s hands disturbed the
silence.
After what seemed to Chris a long time,
Horton straightened his bent shoulders and
grunted.
“I’ll do no more to the blasted thing,”
he said. “But I reckon she’s all right. Ah
Chi can do the rest. With any sort of
luck she’ll fetch up fit for Baris round about
thirty grains. Not too bad. Chris, old
buck, I’m telling you I’d have been ready
to spit blood if that blister had come a
dud! Have a look-see?”
Chris rolled on his side and stretched
forth a hand for the small unsightly object
held up for his inspection, and his head,
coming into the light, stood out in bold
relief against the black void of the bunk
behind. A small head, with fine-cut
features; an attractive face, had not the
crude light harshly accentuated a pair of
deep lines scoring firm brown cheeks from
thin nostrils to the corners of a mouth too
sensitive for peace of mind. The lines
betrayed Chris —he had left the bright, sure
certainties of youth -far behind. Yet he
glanced up with the eager zest of a boy.
Beneath dark brows and lashes the swift
lighting of hazel eyes denied the bitter lines,
flatly contradicted the disillusioned droop
of lips which appeared to have fought vainly
for a sterner set wherewith to vanquish the
ever-springing hope of his eyes. He was
nearly forty; but older men addressed him
as “my boy,” and young men sought his
company.
“I can’t see what you’ve got to whine
about, Horton,” he replied; and anyone,
even an Australian, hearing his speech,
would guess at once that he had come to
that bunk, no matter in what devious ways,
by a route that very probably began on
the playing fields of Eton and undoubtedly
led on past Oxford. Once he had tried to
over-come what in his present situation he
felt to be a disadvantage; but he soon
learned the futility of that subterfuge.
Sometimes he was good-naturedly chaffed
a little, for the pearlers were by no means
so prejudiced as he had imagined. Not,
at any rate, after they knew him—although
he heard rough stuff handed out to another
“Oxford johnny” who had slipped into
the melting-pot of Broome, which was a
cauldron of life wherein those who chose
to stir might bring to the surface an infi-
nite variety of phenomena. But privately
Chris thought that particular catch a cad,
the sort of fellow who deserved what he
got, and who very likely was by no means
all he claimed to be.
Horton, in turn, watched Chris staring
at the pearl newly dug from the big shell
lying on the cabin floor. The shell lay
back up, brown, calloused with age and
minute marine life, a neat little hole gaping
with saw edges whence the blister had been
cut out for examination—later it would go
the way of all pearl-shell fished from the
sea, and on the other side of the world
be fashioned into one of the amenities
of civilisation; buttons on a card, or
buckles, or knife handles. But now the
precious fragment Horton had been at such
pains to dig from within a shining bubble
of nacre looked, as Chris turned it in his
lean fingers, scarcely less brown and rough
than the back of the mother shell. Not
fit for a shoe-button, laughable as a pearl.
Ah Chi, the pearl-cleaner, would have more
than one skin to remove before the gem
would emerge, like a peeled onion, smooth
and white and flawless.
“I’ll take your word for it,” said Chris
at length, with a short laugh. “But so far
I’ve seen more pearls out of Broome than
in it—it’s somewhat difficult to imagine
this will ever be anything worth while.
Dashed funny,” he muttered, thinking in-
voluntarily of the exquisite shimmering
ropes worn by the women he once had
known.
“Oh, I’ve done pretty well out of
blisters,” answered Horton.
“I should think so! What d’you assess
this at?”
“If she’s perfect, and a stringer, about
nine hundred quid.”
“Very nice, too!” replied Chris. “And
they tell me you’re putting up a record
shell-take so far.”
“So far! Oh, yes, it’s not too bad—
this season. It’s all in the game.”
“Is it?” The pleasant voice sounded
slightly bitter. “Well, all I’ve so far got
is a pickle-bottleful of indifferent baroque!”
“Cheer up, old buck. Takes years some-
times, but your turn’ll come. Listen, d’you
hear that?”
“No,” said Chris indifferently. “What?”
Horton did not reply; he was already
half-way through the scuttle. The English-
man glanced once more at the unsightly
half-cleaned pear! in his hand, laid it care-
fully in an open match-box awaiting it
beside the lantern, and with a sigh resumed
his reading.
A splash rose loud above the lap-lap of
the waves. Not another sound. Then an-
other splash, a series of splashes. Chris
jumped up quickly and hit his head, for-
getting that a man cannot stand upright in
the cabin of a pearling-lugger. He
scrambled up the few steps on to the
deck. Horton must have a king-fish on his
tow-line—that was what he had heard and
the reason for his precipitate departure.
Strange that he didn’t call out!
On deck Chris blinked, so dark it seemed
with one dim light in the shrouds. But
soon he could see faintly by glow of a
million stars bright in the black) sky above
the black waters of the Indian Ocean.
“Where are you?” he called, surprised
at not finding Horton.
Splash, splash: only the water answered.
Something white gleamed an instant from
the waves, and vanished. Chris leapt to
the painter of the dinghy at tow, hauled
at it till the rope bit the flesh of his palms,
jumped into the little boat as she bobbed
alongside, and let her go. She was parried
away at once by the tide. Just as the
rope payed out to its limit, he came
abreast of a pair of threshing arms.
He managed to grasp Horton; to heave
him, hands clawing at head, lips muttering
“Murder,” into the bottom of the dinghy;
to hoist him, dripping and flabby as a
dead dugong, to the deck.
The crew of Koepangers and Malays,
roused by Chris’s cry, ran up jabbering
with excitement. Only the whites of their
eyes, the flash of their teeth made human
their dim shapes crowding like monkeys.
Two Malays seized the dripping figure of
their boss; but immediately, semi-conscious
as Horton was, he fell into such frenzy at
touch of their hands that Chris ordered
them away. He had to get the diver, that
supreme personage whose bland Japanese
features remained impassive as if he were
handling the bags of shell he daily fetched
from the floor <?f the sea, to help carry
the boss down to his bunk. Blood streamed
from a gash in Horton’s forehead. He
fainted as they clumsily lowered him to
the rugs. So ghastly he looked that Chris,
sick with dismay, thought he would go out
then and there.
“I stop alonga boss,” he told the Jap
as they crouched side by side in the cabin.
“You no mind’m suppose you no sleep
here to-night?” he asked with a jerk of
the head towards the bunk which was still
scattered by the papers he had been read-
ing, the second bunk which by pearling
law belonged always to the diver. “Sup-
pose you send along tender with hot
water?”
“Orright,” agreed the Jap amiably. He
vanished silently through the scuttle.
All night Chris kept vigil beside the
raving man. From the steaming can
brought by a soft-footed, silent Japanese
tender he bathed the wound, already clean
from salt water, and then bound a clean
shirt he found among Horton’s clothes
about his head. He wondered what the
devil he would do if things were not better
by daylight. To begin with, they were at
least three days’ sail out from Broome. A
good thing for old Horton, Chris had
suddenly got fed up with his own society
and decided to row over on a visit! But
for that the old fellow would be shark’s
meat by now. But, unfortunately, he’d
also told his own crew to up anchor at
dawn and try for fresh shelling-grounds.
They weren’t likely to go when they found
he wasn’t aboard. And yet they just
might—these Orientals were such queer
blighters. And suppose he had to take
Horton into Broome? It would be just
his luck to be absent when a good pearl
was fished, and so never sight it—he didn’t
trust that diver of his! He decided, after
a good deal of thought, that as soon as it
was light he would run up a red flag, as
the old Captain had advised him to do if
ever he had trouble, and see whether the
others had any suggestions to make. It
was fortunate a covey of them happened to
have been working together for the last
few days Poor old Horton, he did look
bad!
At intervals Chris straightened the rugs,
bathed Horton’s forehead, and tried to
find a clue to the mysterious accident in
a stream of semi-delirious mutters. He was
not very successful. Presently, rummaging
about, he discovered aspirin and a bottle
of pain-killer; he administered both, hoping
to heaven he wasn’t overdoing things. In
a little while Horton, drugged, fell into a
deep sleep. But Chris, try as he might,
could not even doze. The sudden alarm
had roused a brain never quick to find
repose. He lay with shut eyes puzzling
over the immediate happenings, trying to
decide on a further course of action for the
morrow, Worrying over his own affairs. But
gradually, .as the hours lengthened and
still he lay awake, his mind slipped into
well-worn grooves which never failed, when-
ever he lay sleeplessly rocking in his lugger,
a few miles off the North Western coast of
Australia, to lead him back to London.
The voice of the sea merged into the
muffled roar of the City; the cramped
cabin, the groans of Horton dissolved and
vanished. Chris no longer lay in a bunk
which smelt faintly of the hair-oil beloved
of the Japanese pearl-diver to whom it
belonged; he was standing beside Lettice
in a bow-window of the old house in Park
Lane. She was staring into the street and
he was staring at her. Would he ever for-
get the exquisite cameo of her profile—
that arrogant nose, that sweep of shining
hair? The best-known profile in Britain,
so they used to say, teasing her; a profile
apparently no passage of time could blur
on the fiim of his memory. Presently. she
would turn, her blue eyes swimming, her
lovely mouth set and hard. He knew
every movement, just what she would say.
she turned, she held out her hands to
him in a gesture she had kept always for
him since her childhood. He caught again
the glint of the pearls she wore as they
rose and fell between her breasts.... She
was speaking. “It’s absolutely np use,
Chris. You know it. Oh, my dear, why
will you harrow our feelings so? We’re
cousins—you know they say it’s madness.”
How he had gfipped her hands then!
“Lettice,” he heard himself saying, despe-
rate, urgent, “once and for all let us be
done with that! Your wretched cousin-gag
is only pretence. You know I have always
loved you; these last few months you have
said” Her cry of interruption echoed
across the years: “Oh, Chris, I do!” But
he had gone doggedly on, fighting for the
commonplace, determined not to waver, to
take her in his arms, obscuring the issue
with flame of fruitless passion. “Will you
marry me or not?” he demanded. “For
I’ll play lap-dog no longer.” She replied,
suddenly cold: “No' one wants you to—
and you should be the first to realise that
marriage is impossible.” He had dropped
her hands then, lowered his eyes as though
in fear of seeing on her lovely face some
expression less lovely than herself. And
now, alone on a lugger, with a half-murdered
man, and after the passage of five long
years, Chris felt his heart shrink within
him even as then, in dread of a truth he
still tried to evade. He had mumbled a
question: “Why?” And Lettice had hurled
it back at him with a lift of her shining
head: “Don’t be so feeble, Chris. One
can’t marry without an income. Did you
ever imagine?”.... He had—that was the
trouble. Gall of the words they flung at
each other after that tasted bitter as ever.
Yet how he had hoped! During the war
things were different: he supposed they all
lost their heads a bit—and Lettice little
more than a child; a girl could love a
soldier then whether he had money or not.
But afterwards—well, it was an altogether
different matter to set up housekeeping
with a man without prospects and no means
other than a cheque presented by Whitehall
after the axe had fallen; especially, he sup-
posed/when her own people were already
so hard up that she was at her wits’ end.
Chris lay in the narrow bunk and watched
that other Chris, years younger, and until
that day in love with life in spite of war
and retrenchment, turn away from Lettice,
stepping carefully as though some precious
idol lay in fragments on the carpet. How
could a chap imagine a girl could say all
the things she had said—mean them, too
—and yet?.... He felt as he had felt when
he had realised that Cooper, his hero at
school, captain of the XI, an awfully fine
fellow, was, on the miraculous occasion
when the hero had invited him home, a
bully to his mother; as when he had dis-
covered a chap he liked at Oxford had got
a girl into trouble and only laughed about
it; as when he first saw his O.C. drunk an
hour before zero. But this was more than
disillusion; this was a rotting at the founda-
tions of all faith in his fellows. He remem-
bered running down the stairs, remembered
the amazement on James’s face when he
crammed a note into the servant’s hand
as he opened the door, remembered shout-
ing: “Good-bye, old boy!” as he rushed
into the street, determined to find Gutter-
idge at once and say he was ready to go
to Australia or aiiy other God-forsaken
spot as soon as he liked.
What he could not remember, for he had
neither seen nor heard, was the old ser-
vant’s shaking head, his subdued whistle as
he spread out the Bradbury, his confidential
remarks later to the chauffeur, strangely
enough a friend of his: “ ’E’s taken the
knock this time, Credulous Chris ’as. I’m
sorry. ’E’s a good sort; known ’im since
’e was so ’igh. And ’e ain’t got no notes
ter spare. ‘Good-bye, old boy,’ he says
ter me. You mark my words, ’e won’t be
up them steps again fer God knows ’ow
long. Damned shame, I call it. ’Er lead-
ing ’im on this two year since the Armis-
tice. I suppose she won’t even ’ave ’im fer
a dancing partner now ’e can’t wear is
giddy uniforms.”
Which last was unjust; for upstairs the
best-known profile in Britain lay buried in
a cushion, in danger of being utterly ruined
for any further appearance that day.
Chris sighed and opened his eyes. The
present came flooding back; insistent, the
lap, lap, lap of the waves demanded that
he remember he was now a pearler. At
least, he thought, this was a man’s job.
He lit a candle in order to see how
Horton was getting along, and the first
thing he noticed was the pearl-shell lying
on the floor. It had been knocked over
in the arranging of Horton. Now it lay
face up; in the dim light the brilliant iride-
scence of its high-lights beckoned to Chris
like a star. The harsh lines round his
mouth softened, overpowered by the spark


which sprang to his eyes. In five years
Chris had built fresh idols, even patched
together the one which had crashed so
badly in Park Lane, and from this distance
any cracks remained invisible. He was
again ready to believe in everybody;
Horton was a good chap, so was the old
Captain; in fact, Broome was a wonderful
little spot, full of a dashed fine crowd of
fellows. This pearling was a strange game;
he’d make his fortune one of these days,
get a seventy-grainer or something, and sell
it for thousands. Then—well, Lettice
mightn’t have married him, but, on the
other hand, she hadn’t yet married anybody
else. The pile of English illustrateds very
kindly told him that. She was evidently
being extremely difficult to plea.se. It
appeared her latest prank was to become
a screen actress. Hadn’t he just read: “We
understand Films, Ltd. have persuaded the
beautiful”....
Horton sat up with a groan.
“Steady, old man,” admonished Chris,
pushing aside his thoughts with the rugs.
“What’s happened?” growled the other,
fingering his turban of improvised bandage.
“What the—by God, I remember now!
Where’s that swine? I’ll wring his damned
neck.”
CHAPTER 11.
Mr. Montgomery.
About the same time that Horton, out
on the grounds, greeted the visitor who was
soon to save his life, Mr. Montgomery sat
on the verandah of the cottage abutting on
to the Buccaneer Arms, his long fingers
pressing tobacco into his pipe, his mind
filled with pleasant anticipation of an after-
dinner smoke, the best smoke of the day.
“ ’Evening, Monty,” hailed a voice from
the footpath.
Between matches he cried back “Good-
night,” though he had not the least idea
who the speaker might be. He wondered
a moment if it were young Peter Fordyce
—sounded like his voice. But no, Peter
had gone outside on the schooner last
week. Well, he didn’t know who it was.
“Hello, Mr. Montgomery!” This time
two figures, the voice a high-pitched girlish
treble.
“Hello there!” he called back. “Who’s
your boy to-night, Queenie? If you can’t
be good, you know”
“Oh, Mr. Montgomery, you are an awful
tease.” The words came trailing over the
girl’s shoulder as she vanished into the dtisk,
and after them floated the wraith of a
giggle.
Every evening, except on those rare occa-
sions when he paid a call, Mr. Montgomery
sat on his little verandah and exchanged
pleasantries with such citizens of Broome as
happened to walk past. Sometimes he
didn’t care to remember just how many
evenings he had sat there; years of even-
ings. But more often, as to-night, his huge
frame lounged contentedly back in the
big cane chair he had got one of the Blue
Funnel pursers to fetch down from Singa-
pore, his long fingers, with the plain gold
signet ring on the left hand, striking match
after match until his pipe was drawing well
and his mind free to meditate upon the
day’s encounters or the possible effect of
the recently suggested contracts on the
price of shell—a tricky idea that of young
Peter Fordyce’s, to try to make the pearlers
come together to demand a standard pi-ice
per ton. He had brains, that chap, like
his father before him, but he wouldn’t
mind betting he wouldn’t succeed. Thirty-
odd years in Broome taught you a thing
or two—you might as well try to drive a.
four-in-hand of kangaroos as make the
pearlers pull together! Every man for
himself was the motto of Broome, whatever
else they might say! A pity Fordyce and
Sons was an opposition firm, or else Peter
and he together might be able to knock
sense into their heads. Oh, well!
He lit another match. The spurt of
light spattered over ruddy cheeks which
even a life-time spent in the tropics and,
so scandal-mongers had it, nights of drink-
ing in the old wild days, had failed to
burn or sallow. A close-cropped moustache,
sandy, barely tinged with grey, covered
the upper lip of a. generous mouth, quirk-
ing upwai’ds; but Mr. Montgomery’s head
was bald enough to proclaim an age at
variance with the upright carriage of the
tall white figure now stretched at ease, and
the little knowing twinkle of his light grey
eyes.
He sat ruminating, those quizzical eyes
fixed on the feathery fronds of a poinciana-
tree growing at the side of the road. He
had looked too long at the same scene
to notice it now. The Buccaneer Arms lay
scattered along the road, a collection of
wood-and-iron buildings with wide veran-
dahs, propped, on short legs of cement
capped with iron beneath the flooring in
order to keep out maurauding white ants.
The bungalows of Broome were all so
built; many boasted enormous shutters,
held up, to admit light and air, by poles
resting on either verandah-rail or lawn—
shutters which could be let down to make
the houses into tight little boxes whenever
a cock-eye or willy-willy descended from
the north-east in the monsoon season.
Some were merely hedged round with
lattice, as was the larger portion of the
verandah of the hotel cottage in which Mr.
Montgomery lived, mealing at the pub;
but directly in front a solitary rail alone
separated him from the footpath. Beyond
ran an immensely wide road, red in the day-
light with dust of the dry season, but lined
by rank vivid grasses in the summer, when
the poinciana-tree would burst into a flame
of red blossom, a bright fire blazing against
the jade-green sea of the Bay, now no more
than a mysterious smudge away beyond the
fore-shore camps, with .stars hanging low
and spattered, like lights seen through a
mist. Between road and fore-shore stretched
an open space, by courtesy a park; some-
day perhaps it would be, for that very
morning the chain gang of natives from
the gaol had planted, under supervision of
an armed warder, the trees and palms now
dotted about in the sparse couch grass.
“Old 8.8.,” otherwise Captain Bert Brittle,
who wore never a collar, but only a
diamond stud with even boiled shirt,
happened at that time to be Mayor, and
meant to leave his mark upon the town.
Those men of Broome who had poured
from lugger and bungalow to camp and
trench had already left theirs, or, rather,
had had it made for them, in the very
centre of the park, where the graceful spire
of a Gothic monument made, had Mr.
Montgomery cared to turn his head and
look, a clear black silhouette against the
clear night sky.
Two or three cars sped past ; more pedes-
trians greeted the blurred white figure just
discernible on the cottage verandah; one
of his native' boys padded silently up, for
Mr. Montgomery held an open permit to
employ binghis in his shell-sheds, and good
boys he had, because the natives all
reckoned him a good boss.
“Hello, Jimmy, what-for you come speak
along me night-time?” he demanded. “You
no good, my word! I give, you sack to-
morrow.”
Jimmy grinned comfortably in the dark.
He liked the boss’s jokes. “Orri’, Mis’
Muntgummery,” he agreed affably, and
delivered a dilatory message from one of
the storekeepers. A little more chaff;
then: “I go cobber-cobber now. Good-night,
boss,” said Jimmy.
“You cobber-cobber too much,” retorted
his master. “All time cobber-cobber,” and
he made a derisive noise in his throat which
sent Jimmy off laughing.
For a time the road remained empty.
Sounds drifted clear as the ring of crystal
on the still night air. Somewhere a gramo-
phone stuttered a syncopated melody. From
the common behind the town floated the
voices of binghis raised in haunting rhythm,
remote and ancient, strange atf though
the songs were echoing down the centuries,
a lost voice crying: “As it was in the
beginning.” The wireless in the next-door
bungalow tuned in. Even across the lawns,
so still the night, Mr. Montgomery caught
the sound, if not the words, of a man in
Perth addressing this audience two thou-
sand miles away. Next the policeman who
played in the town’s orchestra began prac-
tising on his trombone. Mr. Montgomery,
who had listened unmoved to the com-
bined voices of the Stone Age and the
twentieth century, grunted in disgust; then,
feeling the oncoming chill of night, rose
to get himself an overcoat.
As he returned from his room opening
on to the verandah, a heavy tweed coat
covering his ducks, yet another voice hailed
him from the street. But the owner of this
voice did not pass on; he had come pre-
pared to stay. Major Challenge liked a
yarn with Monty. Sometimes Monty liked
a yarn with the Major, provided he could
be restrained from too many gastronomic
reminiscences. He watched him now shuffling
up the steps with the aid of his stick—the
poor old chap was getting decidedly shaky!
Then with a sudden sensation of dismay,
Mr. Montgomery recalled that the Major
was only three years older than himself.
But nonsense! nonsense! You weren’t
any older than you felt—and Challenge
must feel a hundred! And why not? All
the kick he’d ever seemed to want from
life was a succession of epicurean dinners!
Mr. Montgomery gave a little snort of
mirth thinking of the plain food the
gourmet was doomed to eat at the hotel,
iet alone the tucker he must endure when
he was outside shell-opening. Yet, come
to think of it, the old fellow had been
quite happy to dilate upon the excellencies
of an oyster supper he’d recently enjoyed
at the house of a pearler, a Eurasian, as
keen on food as he was—though, certainly,
he had bucked a little at the lemonade and
cakes with which the other topped up!
Well, good luck to him —edible oysters were
as plentiful in Broome as the other variety,
and it was a poor heart that never rejoiced!
Mr. Montgomery chuckled and greeted his
caller with acclamation.
Whilst the other five hundred white in-
habitants of Broome amused themselves at
bridge, or hung over the bars of the five
hotels, or dropped in on each other to
talk scandal and wrangle over who should
by rights be captain of the football team,
or furtively engineered a deal in snide
pearls, or motored through the pindan to
Cable Beach to flirt beneath those exotic
stars, Mr. Montgomery and Major Chal-
lenge, having first, very amiably torn to
ribbons several mutual acquaintances and
discussed the chances of young Fordyce’s
new scheme, in spirit left Broome to its
own devices and returned to the scenes of
their youth. The Major talked over the
many delicate menus he had framed when
he strode through the public dining halls
of London in the gay ’nineties, a truly
magnificent figure, the last word from
Savile-row'. He had inherited an income
of two thousand pounds a year; but some-
how or other it didn’t stand up to the
strain of unlimited and very choice dinners
—and of course, suitable diners to share
such repasts. He once more related to Mr.
Montgomery how he had met a charming
widow and married her—after she had
squared his debts. For a while life had
been a well-nourished dream; a delightful
wife, a beautiful home, a crack regiment,
and, of course, divine food. But, alas, the
allowance from his wife had not proved to
be any more elastic than his own income.
Both it and the lady’s patience had broken
beneath the strain he imposed. Now, he
reminded Monty bitterly for the hundredth
time, he was paid a miserable pittance to
remain out of Great Britain. It was a
never-ending source of regret that he had
been far too old to return, willy-nilljy,
during the war. Yet if Broome had only
remained as it used to be! Those were the
days! Did Monty remember when he first
came out, the fleet of boats he had, the
pearls he got? A gentleman’s existence!
Why, the parties up at the Cable House
before the station was moved south and
the place turned into miserable Govern-
ment offices—ah, great days, eh?
Mr. Montgomery mumbled a reply. They
had at least been exciting. And wet.
Lord! Funny, he didn’t care much for
drink now But his own thoughts soon
drifted from the good old times in Broome
to the boom days in Melbourne, when he
also had lived with a. young and charm-
ing wife, when he had driven a four-in-hand
hell-for-leather down Collins-street, and
dealt in hundreds of thousands of pounds’
worth of mining bonds. Ah, that had been
life if you like! Exciting! There was more
romance in “bearing” stocks than in find-
ing a seventy-grainer, whatever folks might
imagine. What a debacle the crash had
been when it came! Murry and Allsop and
the rest. Winter, who blew his brains out
—a fine chap Winter, but not tough enough
to face life after the banks failed in ’93.
Oh, well, he himself had paid up in the
end, twenty shillings in the pound. He
remembered wondering if he’d been a fool
when, last time he was over in Melbourne,
he’d seen Murry riding round in a Daimler,
better off than ever. And what had Murry
settled at—two bob? Anyway, he was glad
he himself had managed to get clear—no
widows and orphans and that sort of thing
to worry him. After all, life wasn’t too
bad wherever you were—and he’d got a lot
of fun out of Broome.
“Did you hear Captain Goer is bringing
his daughter over from Melbourne with
him? They’re on the Pegasus.” Challenge’s
voice jerked Mr. Montgomery back to
Broome and the present.
“No! Well, I’ll be hanged. I never
thought he’d fetch any of his family up
here again. Must be getting lonely in his
old age. Let’s see, the eldest was a girl
—I suppose that’s the one. A little young-
ster with tow-colored hair she used to be.
I went to Goer’s place a. lot in those days
—before his wife left him. Three kids, the
girl and twin boys. How long’s that—why,
must be twelve-odd years ago. She’ll be
a young woman. Lord, imagine Goer of
all men, bringing a daughter to Broome!
Just for a trip, or does he mean to set rip
house again?”
“I haven’t heard. It was the ship’s agent
who told me about it. And by the way,
he mentioned he’d nearly had a stand-up
fight with ‘8.8.’ at the last council meeting.
D’you hear about that?”
Mr. Montgomery chuckled. Little hap-
pened in Broome that he did not hear
about. But he believed in treating all
information as news. “What was it?” he
asked. “Sounds as if it might be amusing.”
Whilst the Major very long-windedly
told him what he already knew, Mr. Mont-
gomery let his thoughts play round the
news of Goer’s return with his daughter.
That was information. Surprising, when
you knew the sort of man he was. Goer
by name, goer by nature, eh? And now
a young daughter with him! Pretty bit of
a kid. Wonder if she’d grown up like her
mother: she’d be a regular top-notcher if
she had. But if she took after Dad—’nuff
said! It had been a nine days’ scandal
when Mi-s. Goer ran away with that chap
from the Malay States. How could such a
woman, they all said, she so sweet and fond
of her children! Yet to him the marvel
had always been how such a woman ever
came to marry Goer. Still, the longer you
lived in the world the less surprised you
were at anything; when he thought of
some of the things he had seen happen!
What was the child’s name? Some-
thing to do with—was it May? No, June
—that was it!
Suddenly, vivid as though it were really
on the verandah, Mr. Montgomery beheld
a little sunny figure running in breathless
haste to meet him: June had always been
eager, so breathless, so sure the world was
full of delightful surprises, just like a fairy
tale. And her charming belief made most
people ready to indulge the child’s fancy
in order to titillate their own jaded senses
by her eager response Did June not
always find something lovely in Uncle
Monty’s pocket? Did not Daddy’s shell-
openers always bring her the mos’ wonder-
ful things from the sea? Didn’t the colored
men laugh and chatter whenever Daddy
took her down to his foreshore camp,
riding on his shoulder? Something strange
and horrible had happened when Mummy
clutched her tight one day and went away
crying and didn’t come back. She cried
herself to sleep for a week then, though
the twins hadn’t cared so much, perhaps
because they had each other. But Daddy
had been strange and frightening and
shouted a lot, until he took them on the
boat and over to dear Auntie Miriam....
The eager little face vanished. Mr. Mont-
gomery found himself trying to visualise
the girl who would come back.
‘‘What time did you say the Pegasus
is due?” he'demanded.
The Major, still in the thick of the
Council fracas, stumbled in surprise. “Oh,
ah—night tide on Saturday; should be
about ten.”
“Too late for me,” mumbled Mr. Mont-
gomery to his pipe. “Silly old fool!” he
added to himself. It was ten years since
he’d met a boat; what had bitten him to
think he’d like to see at once what manner
of girl June had grown into? He’d see
soon enough. Probably he’d think her as
bad as her father, and she would not even
bother to look twice at old Uncle Monty.
Youth to youth. Only not age to age, cer-
tainly not! Why, he’d rather young For-
dyce to talk to any day than Challenge.
He had chanced to see his wife some years
before in Melbourne, and with a sense ol
shock which seemed almost indecent had
realised he felt not the slightest interest
in the rather more than middle-aged woman
who thirty-five years before had been the
centre of his being.
He rose stiffly from the cane chair. Time
to‘go to bed when your thoughts got out
of hand!
“Sorry, Major, but if you don’t mind, I
think I’ll turn in.”
“My fault for staying so long. I brought
along a few back papers, Monty; thought
they might interest you. I’ll leave ’em.
Mary’s gettin’ long in the tooth these days,
but she don’t miss anything—you’ll see
‘Mrs. Challenge and Friends’ in one of the
rags. But of course no mention of hus-
band,” he added a trifle bitterly. “At Ascot.
And I’ll bet they had caviare sandwiches
and bubbly at lunch—they always did!’’
CHAPTER 111.
Introduction to Broome.
The sun rose up from the sea and poured
the warmth of life into the ghostly grey
world of dawn. Instantly the dead waves
quivered, then danced; like a laugh the
golden light rippled into the cold in-
different sky, into the heart of the sea,
slanting down in visible shafts beneath the
dancing waves. Like a golden wine it
spilled over the drifting luggers, waking
them, kissing to gay brilliance the small red
flag shouting a brave challenge to the en-
circling blueness from the rigging of
Horton’s boat. And away to the north the
fast-nearing sails of a schooner filled out to
cloth of gold as she bore down, like some
fragile phantom of enchanted seas, with*
the dawjL wind blowing on the quarter.
One after the other dinghies crept from
the luggers in answer to that gay signal
of distress. On the deck of the schooner
a young man, bare-footed, bare-headed,
studied the tiny fleet through powerful
glasses and wondered what the trouble
might be.
Chris had already helped Horton up on
deck; they couldn’t all crowd into the
cabin. Horton looked ghastly in the morn-
ing light, but he cursed with unabated
vehemence befitting a piratical appear-
ance—the bloody bandage, the little gold
ear-rings—and then presented his case in
the red-hot dramatic manner he invariably
commanded whenever he was roused.
“Murder, boys, that’s what it was. Cold-
blooded, filthy murder—and if I have my
way we’ll haul Ah Mat off the lugger he’s
gone to, and string him up to the mast.
Yes, of course, he’s gone, sharks or no
sharks! He must have swum away as soon
as he saw Chris here fish me out, blast his
filthy hide! Frightened, he is. Right
enough, too; he knows what I’ll do if I get
my hands on him. Justice? My God.
who says justice? Didn’t I once row miles
under a blistering sun to dress a bad knee
for him —every day for a week? D’you
think his own kind’d have done that?
Not they; they used to watch me as if I
was mad —they’d have let the dog die of
blood-poisoning. Justice, my God! Hit-
ting to kill as I came up out of the scuttle.
A stinking yellow Malay, a short-haired,
white-livered monkey! ”
A fine argument soon raged on the cabin
top where the white men sprawled, in
pyjamas, smoking, whilst up in the hold
the crew prepared a meal over the fire-box
and in subdued mutterings wondered what
would happen. And all the time the diver,
who had been put into his suit, save for
boots and helmet, in case the boss meant
to work as usual, sat like a stolid Buddha
contemplating an erratic universe.
Into the midst of the argument, with a
cheerful “Hullo, you coves, what’s the
rumpus?” clambered the young man from
the schooner. He was greeted variously as
Peter, Pete and Young ’Un. Chris alone
called him Fordyce—somehow, although he
was invariably given his own Christian name
and did not object thereto, Chris could
never himself acquire the easy familiarity
of that Australian habit.'
The story was repeated for Fordyce, who
stood with his fine grey eyes screwed up
in the sun, his well-built body braced to tfie
swing of the boat as he listened in silence
to Horton’s tirade and the quiet affirm-
atives of the Englishman.
“And so you reckon Ah Mat’s hopped it
to one of my boats and is there now?” he
Basked
“Too right I do! That’s where the devil
was going a couple of nights back when I
interfered. I won’t have ’em clearing off
in my dinghy to their gin and cards. By
God, I’ll give him gin and cards!”

Notes on This Mortal Frame
There are in the human body 1247 muscles
which start out at birth all ready and
willing to do good work in the sphe _
which it has pleased Providence to place
Jhem If we gave them all a fair spin we
“Fall from lofty altitudes with the debonair
indifference of cats.”
should be able to write with our toes, walk
on the ceiling like flies, lift six times our
own weight, run like antelopes.,; swim like
dolphins, and fall from lofty altitudes with
the debonair indifference of cats. Also, as
every one 'of the 123 muscles of the neck
would be functioning, the brain would get so
much blood that our cerebral activity would
make Ike Newton look like a cretin. We
should be able to digest glass and granite and
live much longer than Methuselah. Instead
of which we neglect our precious heritage ot
muscles —even our athletes suppress nine-
tenths of them —our nerves go all wonky,
our digestions fail us, our brains (look at
the mess the world is in just now!) don t
work, and we perisli miserably at what
otherwise might have been only the threshold
of a bright. career. ■, . , ,
Now in Sweden these things are ordered
differently. The muscles are treated with
respect; errors are avoided, and, as the great
Swedish philosopher Aristotle remarked, the
corpore sano houses the mens Sana. As an
example of the dexterity of the_ Swedes they
can pronounce words commencing with two
consonants.
It was for these reasons that Frith and
the Showman repaired, on a recent fine
moonlight night, to the atelier of _ Bjelke-
Petersen, who does his best, year in, year
out, to spread the truth among a proud and
stiff-necked generation of Australians. If
he could only catch ’em young enough he
could elevate his pupils to the Swedish
standard despite the defects of their here-
dity That is denied him, but at no matter
what age they fall into his clutches he
limbers up their necks and gets them into
a state where they forget they ever had
digestive organs.
It would take too long—and it probably
wouldn’t do much good anyhow, to tell all
the things Frith and the Showman saw hap-
pen at the Bjelke-Petersen atelier —how for
five minutes on end a pupil warded off the
vicious attacks of his instructor by picking
that instructor up 3 swinging him in the air,
and swatting him so hard and often on the
floor that the whole building rocked; how
large men soared through atmosphere like
torpedoes and landed as lightly as humming
birds, and how a child of tender years in-
dulged in pugilistic conflict with the nug-
getiest and puggiest of pugs, smiling hap-
pily the while. These matters need not be
stressed. It is to a little interlude termed
“medical gymnastics,” which was accom-
panied by a short address by Mr. Bjelke-
Petersen that the attention of the public—
and especially of Parliament —must be
directed. . . .
The subject, hypothetically a victim of
bad digestion, nervous breakdown and brain-
“Large men soared through atmosphere
like torpedoes.”
fag, was seated straddle-legged upon a
padded bench. Behind him, also straddled,
sat a calm and muscular gentleman who
proceeded to correct his (hypothetical)
errors. -Taking the subject’s head in a
powerful grip he twisted it this way and
that, stopping just sort, of screwing it; right
off. (This stimulates the passage of blood
to the brain and completely cures mental
exhaustion.) Then the operator transferred
his attention to his patient’s torso, which
he bent, twisted and wriggled in rhythmic
patterns. (This, in two minutes, gives as
much exercise as could be got by walking
for three hours, and teaches a sluggish liver
that it must rise and shine.) At certain
intervals the operator played chopsticks with
the sides of his hands on all parts of his
victim’s anatomy. (This is massage, and
makes the nerves rejoice.)
A simple treatment to produce such great
results, and its use should not be confined to
gymnasiums. When we are as enlightened
as Sweden is every member of Parliament
will be attended by such an operator, who
will watch his patient keenly. Just as the
Premier is describing section three of the
Bill to Prohibit the Propagation of Para-
lysed Pullets, the operators will fly at their
respective members and agitate their legs.
At section 34, or thereabouts, they will apply
the head-twist. And when Mr. A. B. Pid-
dington is billed to make a few observations
the operating staff will be trebled and will
work in relays. Thus, and only thus, can
we get that concentration of the fresh,
unjaded intellect so necessary to the conser-
vation of the best interests of the nation.
There were some bright moments in the
revival of “Princess Ida” at Melbourne
Royal on Saturday, and the seldom-per-
formed and elaborate parody, on this thing,
that thing and the other that moved Mr.
W. S. Gilbert to genial scorn 48 years ago
was staged with a painstaking attention to
sartorial correctness for which the Firm
deserves every praise. Also, Sullivan’s music,
which is as good as anything he ever scored,
though lacking in the sort of tune the butcher
boy loves to whistle on his meaty rounds,
was admirably rendered by an orchestra
directed for a change by the veteran Slap-
offski, whose forehead blazed with the
mystic fervor of a musical Buddhist bonze.
But the objects of Mr. Gilbert’s scorn are
to-day terribly obscure, and present critic
doubts whether the people on the stage knew
what it was all about. Mr. Gilbert was
apparently poking fun at the militant suffra-
gette, but events have rendered a good deal

of his satire out of date. For instance, one
of the armored feminists expresses intense
horror at the thought of having to be a
surgeon and operate on wounded soldiers on
the field. In the light of what women did
during the late war and what they do now
in a thousand hospitals, operating-theatres
and laboratories every day, Mr. Gilbert is
revealed as not a very good guesser. Another
notion advanced by Mr. Gilbert in this play
is that women love peace and men love war,
but if he had lived long enough to sit with
women on 1915-18 recruiting committees he
might have modified his opinion.
However, the music is the thing, and
Gregory Stroud, Leo Darnton and Vincent
McMurray made good play with it. On
the feminine side Emilie Hooke, _ a new
arrival, winner of a newspaper aria com-
petition, revealed a clear, light organ which
was occasionally out of tune; but her act-
ing was what interested. The producers
had made her as conventional as if she had
been an actress for 1000 years. The end of
the section is in sight, and the remainder
of the season will be devoted to “The Gon-
doliers,” “lolanthe,” “The Yeomen” and
“The Mikado” —entertaining stuff which the
present co. does splendidly.
v
“The Chocolate Soldier,” revived at
Sydney Her Majesty’s after only five years’
absence from that stage, is beginning to
show signs of age. Herbert Browne, as
Alexis, scores heavily in the duets, “Never
Was There Such a Lover” (with Gladys
Moncrieff) and “Falling in Love” (with
Romola Hansen). Edwin Brett, as old Col.
Gasmir Popoff. is effective in an ultra-con-
ventional fashion. Romola Hansen gives
a saucy rendering of the role of the flirta-
tious Mascha (a part which helped Dot
Brunton to stardom). Molly Tyrell is well-
employed as the wife of Col. Popoff; her
rich contralto is very pleasant to listen to.
Old-friend Sidney Burchall is hardly recog-
nisable in the ferocious whiskers and odd
garments of the spy-chasing Massakoft, but
as usual gives a good account of himself.
Under Andrew MacCunn’s baton the orches-
tra gets the best out of Strauss’s music.

Gregorio and Maria Martinez Sierra s
“Take Two from One,” presented at the
Sydney Savoy by the Independent Theatre
players, is a diverting piece of work. It begins
aboard a vessel cruising in the Mediter-
ranean. Among the passengers are laus-
tino, a young and handsome Spanish lawyer,
and Diana, his equally good-looking wire.
Faustino is lionised by the ladies; Diana
is pestered by the men. While strug-
gling with a bearded philanderer, Diana
cries out * Tire ! ,J Unfortunately there
really is a fire in the hold, _ which
the crew has secretly been trying to
quell for days. The aftermath is a number
of drownings, and Diana is among those
presumed to have gone to the bottom. The
scene changes to Madrid. Faustino has
married again. His tranquillity is disturbed
by the return of Diana, sun-tanned and m
a native grass skirt. She had got away from
the ship in a lifeboat which was wrecked
on the African coast; there she was picked
up by slave traders and sold to a tribe of
natives who treated her as a goddess. She
is no longer a sophisticated woman of the
world, but a sheer primitive. So Faustino
has two wives, neither of whom will give
way to the other. He loves them both.
Matters reach a stage where all three
decide to clear out. Faustino appears in
front of a drop curtain, and as the pur-
suing Diana emerges from the prompt side
he clambers over the apron-piece into the
auditorium. Diana yells to' him to return
to the stage, but he retorts that so far as
he is concerned the play is finished. Then
the lights black out. Jack Morgan was
fairly convincing as Faustino. Molly Brown
was sure of herself as Diana, and Eva
Kuraz was well chosen for the part of the
other lady. Next month the Independents
will transfer themselves to the Palace
Theatre, where on January 7 they will per-
form J. B. Fagan’s “And So To Bed.”

“Collits’s Inn,” described as “an Austra-
lian historical musical play,” which was given
an airing at Sydney Savoy last week, was
winner of second prize in a competition. T.
S. Gurr wrote the story and Mrs. Monk
composed the music, which was orchestrated
by Howard Carr. Packed houses witnessed
each of the five performances, which were
applauded generously. Rene Maxwell, the
innkeeper’s daughter, used a fine soprano
voice and gave life to her part.
Other members of the co. did justice to the
singable airs, but w;ere not equal to the
task of making the dialogue seem probable.

The two-act play “She Came by Moon-
light,” performed by the New Sydney Rep.
Soc. on Saturday, is the work of a profes-
sional actress, Annie Hughes, and tells a
simple story effectively with four good cur-
tains. Keith Cribb as Sir Richard Pulmer,
whose home is made happy by the arrival
of a youngster in romantic circumstances,
was hampered by the necessity for explain-
ing his sticky past in lengthy soliloquies.
Joy Rich was attractive as the child, and
William Rees gave a sound rendering of a
doctor. Miss Hughes as a scandal-monger
provided humor. Scott Alexander directed.

A Showman saw “The Circle of Chalk”
done by a company of white Australians in
Melbourne, and thought they did very well
considering; but to anybody who knows the
Chinese drama in its pristine simplicity and
natural habitat the Melbourne presentation
was as near to the real thing as Beresford
Fowler’s attempts to do polite English
drawing-room comedy. The Celestial play-
wright likes to make everything clear to his
audience. Villains have white faces and
virtuous maidens (flappers, please note!) go
unpainted. Good officials have square hats
and bad officials round ones. Hence a
Chinese playgoer witnessing a Western
drama in which there were a number of
delegates to the League of Nations, all in
toppers, would have no doubts about them.
A sick person wears a yellow cloth over his
face, to spare him the trouble of going into
details. If he kicks the bucket a red cloth
draw” o’ T cr him. Male characters who
are good wear moustaches. If they have
bright red faces they are honest; if their faces
are painted in several mixed colors they are
“Indulged in a pugilistic contest, smiling
happily.”
robbers. Clowns have white noses, and that
is often the qnly indication that they are
intended to be funny. A golden face denotes
a heavenly being. Spirits are announced by
the tapping of a gong, and they carry horse-
hair switches, suggesting that there are flies
in Heaven. Ghosts wear black veils and
bundles of paper slips under the right ear;
brides wear red veils to shoo ill-luck away
from their lords and masters, and white is
the hue of mourning. Celestial producers
create the illusion of a military spectacle by
sending on a coolie with a banner marked
“1000 men,” which is easier than Allan
Wilkie’s method of making five supers, march
across the stage and then sprint round
behind the backcloth. Actors are called
“Brethren of the Pear Orchard,” and the
orchestra is known as “the Noise,” as it was
in Shakspeare’s day, and for the same
reason. To complete the illusion there
should be no reserved seats in the house,
servants warming the seats for latecomers.
The audience should drink tea, crack melon
seeds and talk continuously during the per-
formance, and should bury their faces from
time to time in hot, damp towels flung to
and fro over their heads by coolies. Sub-
ject to the above reservations, the Little
Theatre Company’s performance was ado-
qate. The scene where the procurer, Tong
(Hal Percy), purchases the beautiful virgin
Chang-Hi-Tang (Margaret Marshall) for 80
taels and makes a profit of 1200 p.c. in five
minutes by putting her up for auction shows
that a Chinese realist anticipated G. B.
Shaw’s “Mrs. Warren’s Profession” by 600
years or so. The court-house scene also,
where Chief Judge Chu-Chu (Carl Resch)
condemns the innocent Chang to death for
the murder of her husband with ferocious
self-righteousness, was fresher than if it
had been written by Galsworthy. Mrs.
George Bell made a majestic head-wife to
Ma, the wicked mandarin (Helton Daniell),
and Paul Hill, as a Celestial anarchist, acted
with more feeling than any of the others.
A row of approving adjectives is due to
Brett Randall for the elaborate staging.

Spring, summer, autumn and winter passed
in procession before the eyes—or, rather, into
the ears—of a large audience at Melbourne
Auditorium on Saturday, when Haydn’s
lovely oratorio, “The Seasons,” was mov-
ingly described by the Malvern Choral
Society and the Melbourne Symphony Orch-
estra, conducted by Herbert Davis. The
occasion was the bicentenary of the birth of
the composer. Fresh, genial and spontaneous
music, 185 years haven’t dried the dew on
it or blanched its natural colors. John
Dudley, Paulyne Bindley and Newstead Rush
took the parts of Simon, the farmer, Jane,
his daughter, and Lucas, the young country-
man. Their voices sounded light against
the volume of the Malvern choralists; but
Miss Bindley’s voice was tenderly expressive
and Dudley’s rich with passion in the
summer duet, and the orchestra and organist
Lawrence Warner helped in the generally
fine ensemble.

NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Punters in quest of likely prospects for
Christinas had plenty to choose from in the
Horsley Handicap at Warwick Farm. There
were, in fact, 21 startei’s, and a high-class
lot, too. Two interesting candidates were
Tom Pinch —his first race this season, and
his second since he unexpectedly ran
third to Jacko and Legislator in the
Doncaster—and Bon Cretien, from Mel-
bourne. Bon Cretein (4 to 1), a four-
year-old bay mare by Apple Sammy—
Brilliance, looked trained to the minute, and
bringing her over the border was a shrewd
move. The stable (Dave Price’s) got as
much as sevens for its money (lianier,
< Jloriole, Tom Pinch, Gold Digger, Royal
Park and Kichaka were all backed), and
would scarcely have got that, price in any
Melbourne handicap short of the Oakleigii
Plate or the Newmarket. Taking kindly to
the reverse way of travelling, and guided
the shortest way home by McCarten, the
Melbourne mare had a neck to the good at
the finish from Gloriole (6 to 1) ; but
Gloriole would have beaten her if the daugh-
ter of Heroic —Gloaming’s Sister had had a
less unfavorable barrier position than 17,
and had not. been obliged to gallop most of
the way in the ruck. Coming very fast in
the straight, she cut down High Disdain,
who was apparently backed on the tote, and
was going like. steam at the end of six
furlongs, traversed in 1.121.

Bv running fourth Tom Pinch showed
that he had not. lost his speed. He doesn't
look the sort of horse to succeed “first up,”
but a good race will come his way presently.
On Saturday’s running, however, this Page
would rather have Gloriole than anything else
in the Carrington Stakes, and—much more
robust-looking than she was last season—•
she may compass a fast mile under 7.7 in the
Villicrs Stakes. It will be remembered that
she beat Chatham in a thrilling two-year-old
race up the Randwick straight; and it was
no fluke.
.1. T. Jamieson is doing well with his two-
year-olds. A 71b. penalty did not anchor
Limarch in the Ivirkham Stakes, and, with
warm support for Burlesque and Leila Vale,
i he Limond colt went out at fours. The better-
backed pair did not trouble Limarch, on
whom Bartle sneaked a run on the inside ;
but Ivuvera’s brother Shakuni would have
done so if he had not run out wide. Very
like Kuvera in appearance and even more
wayward, Shakuni took command of his
jockey in the small straight and finished
beside the grandstand fence. Even then he
was only a length or so behind Limarch,
whose time for the five furlongs was lmin.
Of sec. Moa Lap (20 to 1) was third.
The Warwick Handicap field seemed of
little account, yet Lovely Balloon, the winner
(at fours), galloped the 12 furlongs in 2min.
SOscc. —see. outside the course record. This
shows liow untrustworthy the time test is.
Rosendo, the only starter entitled to be
put in the second class, failed to stay, and
Lovely Balloon finished too solidly for the
three-year-old Never Despair (14 to 1), who
is getting heaps of racing, and Australian
Bee (4 to 1). Lovely, Balloon is consistent;
his record since the middle of last month
is third, second, second, first. The jockey
was Bartle, who is looking thin as a result
of his illness, but is riding in his old form.
Stonebrook (5 to 1), topweight in the
Farm Novice Handicap, made bis opponents
look cheap. Raleigh, a son of Manfred, who
is far from being as good as he looks, was
indulged with the lead to the home turn ;
then Stonebrook came right away. The
judge reckoned his advantage over the second
horse. Rich Lonsdale (20 to 1), at six
lengths. Stonebrook is in the Summer Cup
with 7st. 71b. He is a four-year-old brown
gelding by Safeties—Atlanta, and his
appearance suggests stamina, as also does
his breeding. Satmoth is a son of Satelles ;
so is Crucis, who emerged from the Novice
Handicap class to donkey-lick a f.a.q. Sydney
Cup field. Stonebrook’s victory gave O’Sul-
livan a double —a distinction he shared with
McCarten and Bartle.
Thpre was a fair amount of money about
at the Farm, and the Leumeah Handicap
was one of several good betting races. Most
of the money came for Port Said and Con-
fab, but nothing had a chance with Trc-
vgllion (0 to 1), once Nowland moved on
him. It was an impressive Villiers trial,
and Trevallion, who has only 7st. 71b., is
now in request for that race. He likes
Randwick, and has won over seven furlongs
there. Poison owns and trains him.

Pat Nailon, the Randwick trainer, is too
shrewd a judge of form to send Vyclian
across to Melbourne on a profitless mission.

not fallen at the last flight when competing
in the Ivalkallo Trial Hurdle at Moonec

Whurlic scored by a number of lengths
from Quick Reward, with whom ho shared

tured the Australian Steeplechase in 1920

quently presented to the Prince of Wales,

cess, trains Whurlic, and the son of Whit-
tier may go far as a performer over the
little sticks. Niall sends his flat-racers to
Jack Holt, and towards the close of the
afternoon Umbertana, who was greatly to
the fore as a sprinter last summer, was
backed from 4 to 1 down to 9 to 4 for the
Kiata Handicap. Encountering trouble at
the start, Umbertana was never dangerous,
In Umbertana’s race Ashley Reed declined
the mount on Green Wave in order to ride
Harry Gavin, whose owner-trainer, F. W.
Hoysted, thought lie had only Umbertana to
beat. Harry Gavin hit the front at the
straight entrance, but hung out badly, and
was beaten into third place. The judge’s
verdict was in favor of Green Moth by a
head from Bonny, with Harry Gavin half
a head farther off. Green Moth is a very
smart mare by Greenstead, the sire of Green
Wave. When these relatives meet again
Green Wave should be first home. He is a
.Caulfield Guineas hero, and shaped impres-
sively on Saturday, being with the leaders
at the turn for home. Green Wave pro-
mises to. be one of the star performers in
short races on Melbourne courses at the
holiday fixtures.
Manfred sired a very brilliant filly in little
Segati, who was runner-up to Rogilla in
the Caulfield Cup. He received another stud
advertisement wdien Bridal Path and La
Scala ran first and second respectively in
the Barkoola Handicap at Moonee Valley.
Both these juveniles are by the Valais stal-
lion, the former being out of Lady Nallen
(by Eye Glass) and the latter from Frances
Tressady, a Victoria Derby winner. R. C.
Power, whose father won the Sydney Cup
of 1879 with Savanaka and landed that
event again 20 years afterwards with Diffi-
dence, owns La Scala. She was supported
with confidence by the stable, but, despite
the pull of 161 b. in weight, could not extend
Bridal Path, who covered the 4} furlongs
in 55fsec., thus equalling the course record
which she, established in November.
Merson Cooper, of the V.A.T.C. commit-
tee, has a half-interest in Lucky Saint, whose
brother, San Antonio, annexed' the Williams-
town Cup of 1924. The St. Spasa gelding
was in commission for the first division of
the Koombahla Trial Handicap and there
is no shadow, of doubt that he would have
won but for being left at. the post. Lucky
Saint chased the field and finished a good
sixth. Spoils went to the rank outsider,
Regalic, who was ridden by a novice. C.
Fitzroy, trainer of Regalic,’ began his con-
nection with racing under the late W. S.
Hickenbotham at IHemington. Subsequently he
was located in Sydney and Adelaide, but he
has been settled in the Victorian metropolis
for a few years past. Income, who hails
from Adelaide, credited Tom O’Dea with
the middle-distance Lalnma Handicap. The
favorite, Rex Aurantic, ruined his chance by
catching a strand of the! barrier in his
mouth.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Influenza prevented Johnny Burke, Syd-
ney’s most promising young boxer, from
fighting Kid Como, of Louisiana, at Leich-
hardt, and Critcher, who weighed a stone
more than the American, took Burke’s
place. Critcher was awarded the decision
but didn’t deserve it. He let Como
lead at all times, scoring only at close quar-
ters, where his extra poundage made much
difference. This writer thought that Como's
clean long-range work won him the first
11 rounds beyond question, and that Aus-
tralia’s ex-champion welterweight was out-
boxed. as well as outfought, in the 13th and
14th.
Tom Lurich and Walter Browning met
for about the 20th time at. Leichhardt
on Saturday. Lurich gave Browning such a
drubbing that no doubt should now exist as
to who is the better man. After the usual
biting, kicking and punching, Lurich’s body-
scissors and press pinned his opponent for
the first fall in the third round. Browning-
evened the score with a Boston crab; but
in the last, round a back-slam sent Brown-
ing to sleep. He remained dead to the
world for many minutes.
Ins and Outs
There was nothing doing in big cricket
in any of the States last week-end. The
Englishmen went to Wagga for a two-days’
match, opening on Saturday, and were
unlucky enough to strike trying weather and
dusty conditions. The visitors dropped most
of their star players, though Wyatt and
Pataudi were included. Wagga did well,
scoring 226 against Bowes, Tate, Verity,
Mitchell and Brown. Mitchell’s slows bagged
7 for 77, but the much-boomed Bowes did
little good with his bumpers. Bennett
(53), Sly (67 n. 0.) and Sadlier (31) played
him with confidence, as they did the others,
Sly is a very promising bat from Wagga
High School. Only 18, lie lias a good
stroke equipment. Bennett is another attrac-
tive young batsman, while Sadlier, besides
batting well, proved himself a ’keeper oi:
parts, stumping Pataudi for 15 in England’s
first innings, which had reached 44 at
stumps.
* * * *
“Sowth Cowst” : After Sutcliffe's indescrib-
ably dreary century in the Sydney Test-
lie took 7 hours 16 minutes to score 194 —it
is grateful and comforting to read of the
exploits of West, of Nowra (N.S.W.). Play-
ing for Nowra against Perseverance, another
rural dorp, West made 144 out of 176 com-
piled by Nowra in 40 minutes. He got
no less than 118 off three overs in 23 minutes.
The ground was a good-sized one with a
four and six boundary, and the overs were
eight balls each.
“Ethnologist”; The recent Test in Syd-
ney had interesting aspects apart from
cricket, since it had the elements of racial
inter-mixture. 011 the English side were an
Indian, an Anglo-Indian of Scottish parent-
age and an Australian, while the manager
was born in the West Indies. In the Aus-
tralian team was a Maorilander.
* * *
“Shrewsbury” : A few months ago we read
in the cables how Jack ITobbs, playing for
Surrey against Yorkshire at the Oval, bit-
terly protested against Bowes bumping ’em
down short at him, and made quite a public
show of it, being vigorously supported by
the spectators, although we are told that
they never barrack in England. On that
occasion P. F. Warner wrote a stinging in-
dictment of Bowes in the “Morning Post.”
With a quivering pen he avowed his hatred of
such tactics, which were opposed to the
purest ethics of the grand old game. Warner
added that these tactics must inevitably lead
to reprisals. Yet in Australia Warner has
been countenancing the very practices against
which he fulminated in England a few
months ago—further evidence that the
crimes of Clapham may be chaste in Mar-
taban.
(Continued on page 5&.)
Racquet and Bawl
Jack Crawford showed one of those sur-
prising reversals of form which are now
generally taken as read in Australian tennis
circles when he met Vines in the final of
the Victorian championship singles at Mel-
bourne last week. Though the American
had downed the Australian in three straight
sets on the latter's home courts in Sydney,
Crawford turned the tables decisively at
Kooyong, winning a meritorious victory by
3 sets to 2, or 21 games to 24. This is
Crawford’s fifth successive Victorian cham-
pionship.
(Continued on page 5 4.)
“Splash”: The two American swimmers
who cast up in Sydney on the Monterey
this week are both notable performers. F.
Kurtz is one of America’s finest divers, and
Maiola Kallili, a Hawaiian, will probably
prove one of the best amateur all-round
swimmers we have seen in this country.
He holds the 100 yards (53 4-ssec.) and the
220 yards (2mm. 14 4-osec.) indoor cham-
pionships of America, and he is near world’s
class as a backstroke exponent. He is also
a good breaststroke swimmer. Owing to
a feud between the N.S.W. and Victorian
swimming heads, Ma has so far refused to
have anything to do with the tour, but pres-
sure is being applied by her own followers
to make the Old Girl climb down.

Ins and Outs
England won the first Test by 10 wickets.
Things looked quite good for Australia on
the third day when, after three were
down for 423, stumps were drawn with
six gone for 479, Wall bowling in great
style. The score dragged on to 524 on the
following day, Pataudi joining Hammond
and Sutcliffe with a century (102). Wall’s
3 for 104 in 38 overs was meritorious work
for a speedster. The consistent O’Reilly
also earned his oats with 67 overs, 117 runs
and 3 wickets. Grimmett, with only one
for 109 off 59 overs, was well below par.
With 164 to save an innings defeat, Australia
just managed to get that in a catastrophic
innings in which Larwood took 5 for 28.
Ponsford and Woodfull failed abjectly. Only
Fingleton (40) and McCabe (32) shaped
like batsmen, if one excepts Nagel and
Wall. The bowlers put on 39 runs for the
ninth wicket, and when Wall went for 20
O’Reilly stayed until the innings defeat was
saved, with Nagel 21 n.o. Next morning
O’Reilly was dismissed without scoring and
Sutcliffe made the necessary run. Neither
Voce nor Allen looked particularly for-
midable and England will evidently have to
build on Larwood and Tate on normal Aus-
tralian wickets.

“Extra Cover”: Stan McCabe’s arresting
century in the first Test has put the Gren-
fell youngster, for the time being at least,
on the pedestal which Bradman has unfor-
tunately had to vacate through illness. But
to the discerning eye McCabe had already
proved himself a Test batsman, though
the century in Sydney was his first in the
tip-top stuff. It is worth noting that
in Tests with England prior to the last he
scored 210 for six dismissals, and topped the
bowling averages with 8 at 27.62. In all
games in England in 1930 lie scored 1013
runs and took 28 wickets. Against the
touring English team he has made 43 (at
Perth), 67 and 29 for N.S.W., and 187 n.o.
and 32 in the Sydney Test.
* * * *
The Australian selectors have got in early
with their team for the second Test against
England, which begins in Melbourne on
December 30.. The rules of the Board of
Control require the team to be picked not
less than 10 days before a match commences.
Kippax and Nagel have been dropped;
< )xenham and O’Brien take their place's.
The side as selected is: Woodfull, Ponsford.
Bradman, Fingleton. McCabe, Richardson.
Oldfield, O’Reilly, Wall, Ironmonger, Grim-
mett, Oxenham and O’Brien. Bradman is
still a doubtful quantity.
* * * *
“Canny Lad”: Although the dough has
been rolling in in unexpected quantities to
date, the managers of the English cricket
side are realising that there is a catch in
everything. Their sorrows are due to the
fact that they are likely to lose a sensible
proportion of their takings when the time
comes to transfer the brass with the exchange
against them. One way out has been sug-
gested, and that is to invest the cash in wool
or butter for sale on the overseas markets.
The same idea was impressed on the South
Africans when they were'here, but they gave
it o miss.

“Kennington”; Veteran Jack Hobbs, now
writing about cricket instead of playing it.
has had a wonderful run in the Test series.
He lias played in 41 matches, and lias had
71 knocks for an average of 54.26. His scores
including 32 three-figure innings, his highest
being 387 at Adelaide. His first was 326
n.o. at Melbourne in 3913, his last 342
at Melbourne 39 years later. Woodfull,
Trumper and Bradman, with six centuries
each, are the leaders of the Australian list.
* * 4= 4=
“Hotham”: Melbourne is wondering
whether a new batting star has swum into
its ken. Playing for St. Ivilda against
E.ssendon in pennant cricket, E. N. Bromley,
flic ex-Westralian batsman, made 3 68 in vefy
attractive fashion, hitting 21 fours and a
sixer. Essendon’s fast bowler, Newton, was
walloped for 32 in two overs, so Victoria
might do worse than give the Westralian a
chance next time Larwood comes along. Brom-
ley had a fine batting record in Westralia in
his few chances against visiting teams, and
he is a useful change bowler.
4= 4: * *
“Mid Off” : England’s big score of 524 in the
first Test match is no record. The Cold Coun-
try has topped the 500 mark on 10 occasions,
the highest total being 636 at Sydney in
1928-29. Australia’s tally is 11, headed by
the 729 for six wickets made at Lord’s in
1930. Only one of the English totals has
been piled up on a home ground, this being
576 at the Oval in 1899. England has only
once scored under 50. This was 45 at Syd-
ney in 1886. Australia’s tally is three, two
of them in England, one innings for 36 at
Birmingham in 1902 being the smallest on
record.
4= 4= 4= 4:
“Third Base” : Mr. Charles Root, who has
attained fame in his native United States
as a baseball pitcher, has been giving his
views on cricket to a Sydney daily. One
thing that seems to have puzzled him is how
Larwood can get up his great pace without
throwing. He cannot understand either how
it is that players are hit so often. In base-
ball, he says, it is a rare thing for a pitcher
to hit a batsman. The answer to that is
easy. In baseball only full pitches are
served up, and the player who lets a full
pitch hit him deserves it.
* * * *
“Members’ Stand”: The loud and savage
yowl that has gone up from those who have
had to put up with the dreadful lack of
accommodation at Sydney C. G. seems to
have stirred the dead bones of the Trust
to life. New accommodation is promised
and one hopeful hint is that the tennis
courts may be wiped out. Sydney C. G.
tennis does not bring a shilling that matters
to the ground revenues. There are only
two or three courts and no important
matches are ever played on them. Football
and cricket are the money-makers. Another
improvement which must be undertaken is
the seating of the superfluous lawns in front
of some of the stands, notably those in front
of the Sheridan and Members’ smoking-
stands. The Hill, too, must bo seated in
terraces.

This week-end the Sheffield Shield players
will get another chance to show their form,
the Englishmen being absent in Tasmania,
from whose fastnesses they will not emerge
until just before the second Test in Mel-
bourne, beginning December 30. There will
be two Sheffield matches, Queensland v. Vic-
toria at Melbourne, and N.S.W. r. South
Australia at Adelaide. The following Friday
N.S.W. will tackle Victoria in Melbourne,
and the Queenslanders will be in Adelaide.
Victoria and South Australia should have an
advantage since they will be playing full
teams. Queensland had hardly been able
to scratch a decent side together to come
south. Among the Welshmen. Oldfield may
play in Adelaide, but will give Victoria a
miss in view of the imminent Test, Love
taking liis place. Bradman is not available
for either match.
“Rabbit”; Some people achieve greatness
but on others it seems to fall like manna
from Heaven. Pataudi’s century in his first
Test is a case in point. Although it ranked
A MORAL VICTORY.
ENGLISHMAN: “I say, old, chap, what do you think of the Pommies now, what?”
AUSSIE: “Not much! Blime, they only made one in their second innings!”
him with two other Indian Test players,
Ranji and Duleepsinhji, no one who saw
him amass the three-figure score is quite
certain how he managed to stay in long
enough to get it—indeed, an English critic
describes it as the worst century in cricket
history. Ranji made his first three-figure
score at Manchester in 1896 —154. The
Tulip’s effort was 173 at Lord’s in 1930.
“Batski”: The sudden collapse of the open-
ing batsmen in the Australian second innings
at Sydney Was unexpected by Woodfull,
as an unusual incident showed. Ivippax
had been listed to go in first wicket down,
and his name was on the board. As
he went out he met Woodfull coming in
and was sent back. McCabe taking his place.
When McCabe fell, Kippax made another
start, but again had his hopes deferred,
Richardson being the new selection. He
went first ball and the N.S.W. player got
his opportunity at last. It must have been
trying on his nerves.
Racquet and Bawl
“Hotham”: At its meeting in Melbourne
the A.L.T.A. Council decided to hold over
until next month the question of challenging
for the Davis Cup this year. As matters
stand at present, it hardly seems worth the
expense of nominating. To persevere with
Crawford and Hopman is useless. Both
have had a long and searching trial and
have not come up to requirements.
“Cut Shot”: The Australian tennis heads
have decided to send Moon and McGrath to
Tasmania for the matches against the
Americans. Adrian Quist. decisively beat
Moon in Melbourne and South Australian
tennis followers are not pleased about the
selection. Quist is one of the Australian
tennis hopes of the future, as is Turnbull,
who gave Gledliill a tough run in the Vic-
torian championships. McGrath —if he fur-
nishes on after his gruelling experience of
the last IS months—is the- only Davis Cup
possibility at present in sight, and young
Quist comes next.
“Kooyong”; Melbourne is looking forward
to a slightly different form of tennis tour-
ney during Christmas week. This is the
annual inter-State tussle of the Catholic
Tennis Associations for the Archbishop
Kelly Cup. All the Australian States will
be represented, and the holders of the cup,
N.S.W.. will have to travel at their top to
keep it.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Divot Digger”: The proposal of the
N.S.W. golf authorities to grade all affili-
ated clubs into three sections, only the clubs
in the one grade meeting each other, is not
being enthusiastically received by many of
the clubs in the Sydney Suburban District
Golf Association which are likely to be
shifted down the ladder. Personal vanity
plays some part in the feeling, but there
is also the impression that the game is
becoming too standardised on the lines of
the district football and cricket competitions.
Another reason is that the extension of
competitive matches will cut heavily into
the playing time of club members not good
enough to reach the grade teams. This is
a well-founded objection and one likely to be
strongly pressed at the annual meeting of
the association in January.
“M.C.” : The final for the Ollera (N.S.W.)
golf club championship saw • C. L. and
G. Mackenzie, father and son, pitted against
each other. The senior won 4 and 3 in a
26-hole match. Mackenzie senior is in the
stayers’ class, for it is close on 30 years
since he partnered Dr. R. Pope in the Aus-
tralian amateur foursomes, which the couple
duly collected. He is also one of the few
players who have represented N.S.W. at golf
and tennis.
“Wurlitzcr” : The annual competition for
the golf championship of the Australian film
industry was completed at Manly the other
day and, for a section of the community,
quite befogged the Test cricket issue. Four
States were represented, and the winner
turned up in the N.S.W. representative, A.
Thom, after a great tussle with A. King, a
Victorian lefthander, which was only decided
on the last green. Thom will take tem-
porary possession of tin; Hoyt Gold Cup,
as well as the title.
* * * ❖
“Hoylake”: Always something new in
golf. The latest is a paintless ball now
on the market. It conforms to all official
requirements under St. Andrew’s jurisdic-
tion, and, primarily intended for low-mark
players, if is catching on with all and
sundry. The feature of the ball, apart from
its paintless cover, is that it is quite smooth
and polished. This is an interesting throw-
back. The original feather-stuffed leather
ball had an irregular surface, thanks to sewn
seams. When the first putties came in they
were smooth, but were found to be very
unsatisfactory. Then someone got the idea
of roughening tiro surface, and much
greater distance and accuracy followed.
Since then every make of golf ball has had its
surface roughened in some way, by pitting
or half a dozen other familiar methods.
One would like to know how the trouble
with the original smooth ball has been over-
come in the case of this latest version.
* * * *
“ITotham” : Though young 11. L. Williams
lost his Australian title to Mick Ryan at the
last Australian championship meeting, he is
now playing better golf than ever before. Ho
has been experimenting with his drive, and
with a view to getting greater length has
had an inch added to the length of his
wooden club shafts. He finds that this has
given him greater length, accuracy and
steadiness, yards having been added to his
average length.
* * * *
“Sandringham”: To celebrate the cen-
tenary of Melbourne’s foundation, Metro-
politan proposes to gather amateur and pro-
fessional players from all the corners of the
earth, providing good trophies and cash
prizes. The A.G.U. has been asked to
change the scene of the Australian cham-
pionships in 1935 from Adelaide to Mel-
bourne, Melbourne relinquishing a turn as
compensation. The Golf Union wakes up
about once a year, and there are indications
that it will ignore the request of Metropoli-
tan. The latter has now announced that it
is going ahead with the project even if the
A.G.TJ. will not make the change, and if
the Federal body doesn’t like that it can
lump if.
Car and Cycle
“Helidon”: A mighty creditable light-car
run was brought off in Queensland last week
when a stock model Chevrolet went from
Brisbane to Toowoomba in an hour and
45 minutes. D. A. Lupton was at the wheel,
and had F. Gelsman as an offsider. A skid
accident delayed the car for 15 minutes, but
in spite of this the time beat by 22 minutes
the previous best by F. Eager. The dis-
tance covered is only 100 miles as the crow
flies, but in between there is a 3000 ft. climb
on a tricky, winding road over the Dividing
Range. There was rain most of the run.
“Kick Starter” : The twin teams of Aus-
tralian and English dirt-track motor-cyclists
collected by .7. S. Hoskins have arrived, and
will show throughout the States in a series
of match and championship events. There
are eight riders in each team, and both
include the cream of the talent in their
respective countries. Among the Austra-
lians are Vic. Huxley, Max Grosskreutz,
Frank Arthur and Van Praag.
“Kick Starter”: The motor-cycle record
has gone up again. The German Henne,
riding a specially-built and -fitted B.M.W.
750 c.c. machine, covered a straight run in
Hungary at the mean rate of 151.9 m.p.h.
for a two-way run. .T. S. Wright, the Eng-
lishman, was the holder of the record,
having done 150.7 m.p.li., topping a previous
best by Henne of 134.5 m.p.h. Wright
also had a special machine built to make
his figures; now he will probably set about
acquiring something out of the box.
* ❖ ❖ *
“Umtali”: An amateur cyclist likely to
make Australia’s best sit up is J. C.
Geogfaegan, of Natal, now on his way to this
country. The Afrikander holds every track-
cycling record in South Africa, from the
quarter to 25 miles, and every road title to
100 miles. The expenses of his tour have
been guaranteed by the Australian amateur
cycling bodies, and arrangements have been
made for him to meet Australia’s best at all
distances he fancies on track or road. The
Natal rider will be the first amateur pedal-
ler to come this way from overseas for some
years. The last two were also South Afri-
cans, 11. Kaltenbrunn and G. Thursfield,
who followed on the heels of American C.
Osteritter. Kaltenbrunn put up an unpaced
record for the hour in Melbourne, while
Thursfield won the mile amateur champion-
ship of Australia at Sydney Sports Ground.
* * jjc
“Sprocket”: During its 50 years’ exist-
ence the N.S.W. Cyclists’ Union has stuck
to. a series of four amateur track champion-
ships of half a mile, a mile, five miles and 10
miles. A new system this year involves the
decision of eight senior events, each of
which will be a State championship and
also part of a point score. The winner
will be given the title of all-round
champion of the State, as ivell as a special
medal and sash. There will be a series of
four for juniors. The new senior events
will be the quarter-, half- and three-quarter-
mile, and the one, three, five and ten miles,
plus a 1000-metres unpaced time trial.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Lennon's Hotel
BRISBANE
The Centre Queenslands
Distinguished Social Lite.
Last week all the people this Letter knew
went about saying that they weren’t going
to buy Christmas presents. The overdraft
at the bank was plethoric, the “account ren-
dered” on their bills was menacing, the
income-tax man had scraped them clean, and
anyway they were sick of sending their rich
relations a de luxe edition and getting in
return a machine-embroidered doyley and a
penny “Merry Christmas” card. The writer
joined loudly in the chorus; and then, the
first shoots of the Christmas tree pushing
their way through her innards, she sneaked
off, even as a tlnef in the night or the addict
to his drug, to the counters of the city’s
shops. And in her journeys she met every
one of her friends who had been loud in
their determination not to make gifts, all
loading themselves up like camels with
powder puffs, hankies, books, gloves and such
oddments. Seems as though not even axeman
Hard Times can chop down that Christmas
tree.
Mrs. Walter Swinson gave a boost to her
appeal for more music in the home last
Friday when she lured a hundred or more
of her friends from Sydney and her Turra-
murra neighbors into her home to hear a
hand-picked programme of ’cello', violin and
vocal music. Lady Game, herself a musi-
cian, was among the guests, and brought
with her Miss Crowdy and Commander Gif-
ford. Further Government House atmo-
sphere was given by General Anderson’s
wife, Mrs. Harry Budge and Joan Gifford.
Joan’s silky-brown hair fluffed from under
a neat caramel-brown hat, and she had a
cape of lace yellow as a golden plum on
her brown frock. Captain and Mrs. Feakes
represented the Navy, and the Fays and
Hosts the Consulates.
The affair was very fashionable, which,
this Letter hopes, will mean further private
engagements for musicians. Orthos Mar-
telli’s ’cello' was rich and sonorous, and
the Valentine and Popper numbers were
specially appealing. Lionel Lawson’s violin
sang Bach, Gluck and Debussy through the
flower-scented room; and Stanley Clarkson’s
voice tugged at the heartstrings in such love-
liness as “I Heard You Singing,” “Linden
Lea” and Rachmaninoff’s “Morning.”
Tassy’s big stone Government House,
about a mile from Hobart, is younger than
the brown, baronial-looking pile . that fronts
the waters of Farm Cove, Sydney. The
former was completed in 1857. The Games
will occupy it during their visit to the Apple
Isle, and will find about seventy rooms in
which to roam, if so disposed.
The sunshine and the softness of our days
and nights cause the arts to flourish. Take
the classic ballet. Except when piloted by a
Pavlova it has had little encouragement in
Australia from the theatregoing public, but it
refuses to be crushed thereby. Classic danc-
ing makes a vivid appeal to the young Syd-
neyite. The First Australian Ballet, under
the direction of Louise Liglitfoot and Misha
Burlakov (both exponents of the Russian
ballet), continues its good work, and girls
and boys pursue the beauty of rhythm it
has presented to their imagination even in
these days of tap-dancing and acrobatics.
The company’s recent presentation of “Wal-
purgis Night,” in which the legendary revels
of Helen, Lais, Phryne and Cleopatra round
the Temple of Apollo are in full swing, was
at once ambitious and successful. The move-
ments in these wild revels are complicated,
the effect both spirited and feather-light.
Eloise Gree’s Helen was a graceful and fluid
presentment, and Betty Ainsworth made a
charming Phryne.
The toy departments in the city stores are
very gay this Christmastide; the reason,
this Letter thinks, is that, in all the big
stores, there is some form of entertainment
in which the kiddies can take active part.
At a mammoth store there’s a sub-
marine in which the lucky passengers have
all the sensations of going down, fathoms
deep, to emerge at some cave of snow and
ice and whisper their wants to Santa Claus.
This is an amazingly clever bit of illusion,
where the quickness of the dive deceives the
eye. Hero also is a toy railway whose busy,
fussy little train dashes past tiny farms,
paddocks in which cows graze and gum-
trees grow tall and straight. In another
shop there’s magic in the “Pirate Ship,”
manned by a ferocious-looking crew
with black patches over the eye and hooks
for hands. However, these same gentry
could be very gentle with small girls who
walked the gangway to whisper to Captain
Santa Claus their desire for a “baby Betty
doll” or “a red horse, same’s the one at
the door.” And everywhere there are
Punches and Judys, magicians, circuses,
merry-go-rounds, and sometimes trains that
carry their passengers around the big floor.
There’s a black pony _in its own, or a
very good imitation of its own, skin. It
has harness studded with silver nails, and
it rocks! That is too expensive for every
mother and father; so are the high New-
foundland dog and the almost life-size, polar
bear. But the teddy bears (the darlings!)
are at prices to fit all pockets.
The morning mail has begun to be most
exciting. Something that looked like a tiny
Egyptian papyrus, its roll bound with a
wide silver band, fell out of a baby envelope
a few days ago. When the outer layer was
peeled off, another stiffer layer remained, still
banded in silver. This had two wooden
end-pieces, one gay with crimson blobs and
cord. Unrolled it resolved itself into an
invitation from the Little Citizens for their
Kindergarten Christmas tree. A rolled
visiting-card wrapped in . emerald-green
paper sealed with a five-pointed gold star
bade one to the Ellen Desailly revels, while
the two front flaps of the card from the
baby ones at Frances Newton formed a
green, green fir-tree in a brick-red tub.
The new headmaster who takes over the
reins of The King’s School, C. T. Parkinson,
comes direct from a school rich in tradition —
Christ’s Hospital, more widely known as
the Bluecoat School. Coleridge. Charles
Lamb, Leigh Hunt and Samuel Richardson
were Bluecoat boys. Earl Beauchamp is
one of the school’s 500 governors. King’s
new head is expected to arrive in time for
the opening of next term on Feb. 8.
Miss Charles Fairfax opened the combined
art show of Gladys Owen (Mrs. John D.
Moore) and Ethel Spowers, of Melbourne.
Miss Fairfax has known both exhibi-
tors since their childhood, and has known
three generations of their families, so. that
part of the opening had quite an intimate
touch. The Grosvenor Galleries were not
so crowded as usual, but there was a Test
match on that afternoon. Miss Kate Egan
was there and bought a Bathurst landscape
painted by Gladys Owen on her honeymoon;
Miss Fairfax bought one of the woodcuts,
which are a strong point of the show. The
woodcut is now having the vogue abroad
that the etching had a few years ago, and
there is decided charm about their force
and definite outline. Ethel Spowers’
“Swings” and “Wet Afternoon” arc full of
movement and color.
Ida Leeson, the clever-looking subject of
this Bulletin photograph, has achieved a
position never before held by a woman.
She has been
appointed head
librarian of the
Mitchell
Library. When
chosen, Miss
Leeson was on
the staff of
the Public
Library, where
she started as
a slip of a
girl, a glitter-
ing B.A. with
honors (his-
tory) in her
pocket. In
those days she
worked along-
side Chris
Brennan, who
was chief
c a t a loguer.
That wa.s be-
fore he went
t 0 be a shining light on the University staff.
Brennan was even in those days a widely-
known Grecian, and he offered to teach his
beloved language to Miss Leeson. After
her initiation into the ritual of libraries
Miss Leeson went for a few years to the
Mitchell, then she returned to the Public.
Now she crosses the road again as Mitchell
Librarian.
A moon at the- full, cutting a silver swathe
on the waters out to the Heads, and a stage
fronted like an old Greek temple—these
will be the backcloth and the setting for
Racine’s “Atlialie,” which Belgium’s Consul
Segaert is presenting at the Amphitheatre
at Balmoral on Thursday evening.
There was as much excitement in the
Savoy the other night as there might be in
the old manor house when the son and heir
is being born. And in a way there was a
birth going on —a new work was being pro-
duced. This was “Collits’s Inn,” a musical
play, of which Varney Monk wrote the
music and T. S. Gurr the story. Howard
Carr, who was responsible for the beautiful
orchestration, directed the instrumental
forces, and Cyril Monk, husband of the
composer, led the orchestra. By now half
of Sydney, including Lady Game and Alfred
Hill and Sydney’s musical brethren, has
seen “Collits’s Inn,” and the enthusiastic
audiences were maintained through an
entire week.
The scene of the drama is the Blue Moun-
tains, and here, just when the road to the
Bathurst Plains had been opened, a dashing
officer of his Majesty’s forces and a bush-
ranger were rivals for the love of Mary
C'ollits, the innkeeper’s beautiful daughter.
Those were rough times, and sometimes you
felt that the forces of Nature in that then
isolated region and the power of the men
who were grimly fighting her might have
been more insisted on musically, though
perhaps if the composer had started to do
that the theme would have resolved itself
into very grand opera. At the end of the
first act on the opening night everybody
was moving about congratulating one an-
other on this Australian success, and at
the final curtain nobody wanted to go home.
There were cheers for Varney Monk and

Sydney’s new Mayoress, Mrs. R, C.
Hagon, will come as no stranger to the wel-
fare committees of the city. She is an
active worker
for the T.B.
Soldiers and
Sailors’ Relief
Fund, and has
been its presi-
dent for ten
years. Mr s.
Ilagon is a
member of the
Council of the
A u s t ralian

Society, and
is on the com-
mittees for
the Adult
Deaf and
Dumb and the

Mrs. R. Fur-
ley and Mar-

Another friend of the children, Dr. Thomas
Storie Dixson, died last week. He did
splendid work for the institutions for the
blind and the deaf and dumb and for the
Lady Edeline Strickland Hospital for
Infants. The St. John Ambulance and the
Australian Museum, where he had planned
to build up a children’s section, were just two
of the other interests to which this kindly
and brilliant medical man gave his talents.
Just eight months after her son was named
Premier of his native State, Mrs. Sarah Ann
Stevens died suddenly at her home in Mar-
rickville. She had lived in Marrickville for
over 30 years and was noted for her good
deeds and kindly disposition. She continued
to work in her belove*d garden up till a few
days before her death. Brighton (Vic.) was
her birthplace. A widower, two sons and
five daughters arc left sorrowing.
The indomitable Hugh D. Mclntosh cele-
brated the opening of his new guesthouse,
Bon Accord, Spiingwood, with a big bail
on Saturday night. The place belongs to the
Stewart Dawson estate, and is famed locally
for its beautiful garden and views and for
the ballroom, which is a feature of the west
wing. A couple of hundred people motored
up from Sydney—Springwood claims to be at
the end of the best 50 miles of motoring road
out of the metropolis—and most of the well-
known residents attended, including Norman
Lindsay and his wife. Lord Beauchamp
and the Hon. Hugh Lygon made speeches
wishing luck to the new venture, which, by
the way, is not going to debar the Mclntosh
from continuing his Stadium activities. Ada
Reeve not only spoke eloquently but smoked
a big cigar to the bitter end. She claims
to have been a cigar-smoker when it was
considered shocking for a girl to smoke a
cigarette. Amongst others who joined in
the festivities were the Frank Smiths, Percy
Stewart Dawson, Dr. Leila Keating, of Mac-
quarie-street, Bryl Walkley and the Stephen-
sens—he is the ex-Rhodes scholar who is
publishing Australian books from The Bul-
letin office, and she was a star dancer with
Pavlova.
A line telling the glories of historic London
comes from Miriam Hyde, the 19-year-
old South Australian whp, during the year,
blossomed into the youngest Bachelor of
Music the Adelaide University had ever
known. In addition, Miriam won the Elder
Scholarship, which carries three years at
the Royal College of Music, and the Adelaide
Uni. granted its artistic daughter a free
passage to England. The impressionable
girl spends her holidays absorbing rural
England and historic London.
Mrs. Hubert Fairfax is one of the most
active workers for the C.W.A. and has just
finished a very successful year as president
of the Harborside branch. The branch had
the happy notion the other day of framing
its annual meeting in a garden party. This
was held in the grounds of Elaine, Mrs.
Hubert Fairfax’s home at Double Bay,
and after the business had been disposed
of, the new president, Mrs. Jimmy Ashton,
presiding, there were tea and games and
competitions on the lawn, with Mrs. Hubert
the Queen of the May, so to speak. Any-
way she gathered one financial nut that
no * State Treasurer in present knowledge
could crack. Under her presidency the
branch raised 1253 during the year, and
expenses were only thirty shillings. Among
the applauders of the balance-sheet were
State president of the C.W.A. Mrs. Matt
Sawyer, Dame Alice Chisholm (something
of an organisms: genius herself), Airs. C.
Dolling. Mrs. F. W. Rymill and Mrs. Hod-
gett, of S’Australia’s C.W.A.; Miss M. Fyfe,
from Maoriland : Miss Cullen, from Queens-
land ; and Miss Dulcie Brigg, from Walgett.
What a wealth of imagination and affec-
tion goes to the making of toys! Since time
immemorial men and women with love in
their hearts have fashioned dolls and balls
and soft, woosey things to bring the sparkle
of delight to baby eyes. Even the little
Egyptian girls, dead these thousands of
years, played with their dolls beside the
green waters of the Nile, and those dolls
were the remote ancestors of the coquettish
misses and the dear little romps that come
from Paris, London and Vienna, and of the
baby dolls now being made in Australia. This
Letter called on a glittering glass case full
of the last the other morning. There, they
were, row after row of Australian citizens,
smiling and happy. The case was reminis-
cent somehow of a particularly populous
maternity ward. Then there is the red
horse, bravely caparisoned, whose head and
every section of its body moved. What a
steed for Don Quixote! And that animal,
too, is one of a large Australian family
that includes the most sinuous , and happily-
grinning crocodiles. And, talking of crocs.,
there’s a beauty chasing an admiral, cocked
hat and all. up and down and around one
of the Santa ships lying at anchor high
above Elizabeth-street.

“Unless bathers thoroughly soap and shower when they leave the
Water the pores of the skin will clog and refuse to perform their
normal function of discharging waste poisons from the body .”
This is the warning issued by doctors
All kinds of complications can develop through slight neglect and it is
extremely necessary that every bather should use a genuinely germi-
cidal toilet soap. Tenax Germicidal Toilet Soap comes at the moment
of greatest need! It is the only soap containing Ti-trol, a germicide
more potent than carbolic, yet non-irritant and non-poisonous.
As you lather with Tenax you liberate the powerful Ti-trol which
neutralises infection .... cleanses the pores.... and leaves the skin clear
and healthy. An emulsion from Tenax Soap killed typhoid bacilli in
twenty seconds.
Rub Tenax well between the toes and let the lather remain for some
time before rinsing—this is a prevention against the dreaded “Surfers*
Foot”
Tenax Corrects Dandruff
Tenax Germicidal Toilet Soap is a delightful corrective of all hair and
scalp ailments. Tests prove that Tenax destroys dandruff organisms
—invigorates the glands—and nourishes the hair.
Use Tenax regularly—it is one of the safest precautions against germ
infection of every kind —and remember, Tenax Soap has the endorse-
ment of the Medical Profession.

Saturday was dreadfully hot and windy,
but at Moonee Valley racecourse in the
shadow of the stands the temperature was
quite bearable. Though there was a good
show of flowers —pansies, stocks and so
forth—they were wilted somewhat, and the
Summer raiment of fair punters provided
most of the color that contrasted with lawns
(Whose emerald hue was as fresh and bright
ris ever. Most of the younger women came
to the races in sleeveless silken frocks. White
was largely in favor for both frocks and
hats. Kath Rogers Thomson was one of
those who chose an all-white turnout. The
Luxton lady was in georgette, pin-spotted in
navy and white, with a black straw hat.
Mary Emmerton looked cool in georgette
patterned in green, black and fawn, topped
by. a shady green hat. Mrs. Richard Linton’s
beige flat crepe and lace gown, with a largish
brown hat, seemed right for. the day, and
her sister, Mrs. Murray Heffernan, faced the
heat in sapphire-blue chiffon and a shiny
straw hat of the same _ shade. Mrs. A. E.
Kimpton found comfort in seagull-grey chif-
fon allied to a black hat. Mrs. R. M.
Cuthbertson was of those who donined black
and white. Mrs. Richard Thomas, Mrs. A.
V. Hiskens, Mrs. Sep Miller, wearing apple-
green’ crepe spotted in white; Mr. and Mrs.
R, St. John Hughes, Mr. and Mrs. W. Mor-
tfll, she in green and white, and Mrs. C.
Wenman, a study in brown, were in the

The knot-tying of Olga, daughter of
Major-General and Mrs. Bruche, and Cap-
tain R. 11. Le
M. Lawrence,
of the 14th
Punjab Regi-
ment, was
attended by
many naval
and military
officers. St.
John’s, Too-
rak, was deck-
ed with white
flowers, and
there was a
guard of
honor with an
arch of swords
for the newly-
weds as they
left the
church. The
bride, pictur-
ed here, wore
a gown of
white. satin,
cut on princess lines, with a Limerick veil.
A trail of frarigipanni dangled from ; a
shoulder of her gown, and she carried a
white posy. Ivory ninon inlet with bands
of blue to match their wreaths of del-
phiniums clad the ’maids —Alison Clark,
Judy Finch arid Ruth Good. The after-
rejoicings took place at the Bruche home,
South Yarra.
The Strathnaver was in gala dress for
a dance organised by the Navy League in
the interests of the Sea Cadets. Hundreds
of patrons streamed up and down companion-
ways, and non-dancers came to anchor in
the gorgeous saloon for a game of bridge.
Heading the directors of the very sociable
hop was Mrs. Ross Grey Smith, who was
swathed in deep parchment-hued satin.
Sheila Morell, in begonia-pink crepe, shared
secretarial duties with Patricia Hammond,
Betty Hornabrook and Gwen Hornabrook,
the last-named dancing in lapis-lazuli blue
with a touch of cyclamen pink. In the
throng were Air Commodore and Mrs. Wil-
liams, Rear-Admiral Hyde’s wife in lupin
blue, and Mrs. Percy Alderton in black.
The Robinson lady poured tea for many
guests at the Alexandra Club as a welcome
to her daughter Mrs. Huntly Griffith, on
a visit from Ceylon, arid to honor Jean
Watson, whose wedding with Alan Robinson
will take place about the time this Page
is putting on its pink wrapper. The hos-
tess blended tones of brown in her gown
and millinery; apricot pink was the hue of
the silken frock apd wide-leafed hat worn
by Mrs. Griffith, and the bride-elect topped
her gloxinia-red crepe gown with a shiny
black straw hat.
The kiddies of St. Joseph’s Orphanage,

Beatson.
When Sheila, only daughter of the G. T.
Johnsons, Caulfield, wedded William, son
of the 11. D. Hirsts, of Albert-road, she wore
a gown of ice-white angel-skin and. a veil
of tulle and Honiton lace. Two ’maids
sported leaf-green georgette frocks and
velvet hats of the same shade. The cere-
mony at Grammar School chapel was fol-
lowed by a party at Grosvenor.
A filmy Limerick lace veil draped in bonnet-
mode dipped to the ground over the parch-
ment-toned satin gown of Alice, youngest
daughter of the late T. E. Varley and of
Mrs. Varley, of East Malvern, when she
became Mrs. Richard Ormond Chex-ry. The
shower bouquet of yellow roses she carried
was in harmony with the deep primrose-liued
organdie frocks of her three attendant
’maids. Their posies of brown and gold
pansies matched their wreaths of leaves.
The ceremoxiy was at Grammar School
chapel, the bridegroom being the youngest
son of Dr. and Mrs. T. Cherry, of Glen
Iris. Dr. E. C. Varley handed his sister
over.
At All Saints’, St. Kilda, Nancy Joan

Mrs. H. F. Hetherington, who is to leave -
for a visit to England shortly, said an revoir

Mona Mcßurney, who died last week, was
a daughter of the late Dr. and Mrs Mcßur-
ney, of Edinburgh, who came to this State
many years ago and settled in Geelong.
Mona, a musician of great talent, was Mel-
bourne Uni.’s first Bachelor of Music. She
composed many songs and two’ operas, one
of which, “The Dalmatian,” has been fre-
quently performed. She taught Fi-ench and
Italian at the Uni. and the Albert-street
Con., and was a life member of the Lyceum
Club.
Melbourne has an Arnold Bennett, but
he doesn’t write novels. His forte is del-
phiniums, and some exhibited in the window
of a Collins-street shop almost caused a
traffic block. The clusters of blooms were a
yard long and five or six inches in diameter.
Undies continue to be not only scanty but
scantier. A well-known dressmaking estab-
lishment assures this Page that ladies some-
times wander in and quite debonairly slip
out of everything but their skin to have their
frocks fitted. Not so much as a layer of
chiffon must blur the admired outline. Per-
haps the evening frock being made on such
sheath-like lines is responsible, for this occa-
sional exaggerated desire for sleekness.
Flounces starting on one hip and cork-
screwing down the dress occur with fre-
quency. Hips have been reduced to a
minimum. Epaulettes, capes and scarves
help in this effect, and wraps in the form of
the small fur coats that barely reach the
waist are having quite a vogue. Plain ox-
flowered pique and other cotton materials
are built into raiment for the dance and
the theatre, and the result is fresh as a posy
of cottage garden flowers, and almost as
soon wilted. Black hats will be worn by
evex-y woman this coming summer, accord-
ing to the number already on show. They
come in flops, in berets, in turbans, in little
plates and in sailors’. Plaid chiffons in
black and white can be both dashing and dis-
tinguished for race wear; the lines, however,
must be arranged crossways or much of the
smartness is lost.

From the Speck :
Kitty, pretty twin daughter of the Ernest Blyths,
Armitstead, and Dick Dobbie, son of the late
Judge Dobbie, Hobart, were made one at the
Anglican Church, Kimberley, by the Rev. F. 11.
Lansdell. The bride’s frock was of shell-pink
satin, cut in long, closely-fitting lines. Her lace
veil was arranged cape-fashion at the shoulders.
Sisters Lorraine and Betty ’maided in Victorian
frocks of crisp mauve organdie, worn with wide
drooping hats of white straw. After the bridal
couple had left, guests remained at Armitstead and
danced till late in the enclosed verandahs.
To send one of the Tassies to represent the
family name at the Forster Cup races at Adelaide
next year, the Royal Yacht Club engineered a fair
at the clubhouse. Stalls and sideshows raked in
the necessary.
The Launceston Art Society sponsored an exhibi-
tion of J. Stanley Fuller’s work at the society’s
rooms. The young artist showed about 45 pictures.
Landscapes exhibit him at his best, but there are
two or three fine examples of still life.
There has been much altercation over the recent
felling and lopping, of trees in our Botanical Gardens,
and a deputation has risen up to demand that
nothing further be done without more expert super-
vision. Hobart owes much of its beauty to the
trees planted by our forefathers, but the modern
idea of beautification seems to consist largely of
getting rid of them.
Among newcomers to Tassy are artist W. P.
Newton and family, who are likely to become
permanent residents. Originally from Scotland, the
Newtons have been living in British Columbia.
E. T. McPhee, leaving Hobart to take up
official duties as Commonwealth Statistician at Can-
berra, was farewelled by the Commonwealth depart-
ments. H. J. Exley fills his shoes in the Hobart
office.
Marie Bjelke-Petersen is at Devonport on the track
of local color for a new novel.
At Adelaide:—
Mr. and Mrs. A, A. Simpson gave a dance at
their home at Burnside, where the rooms were
glowing with mixed flowers from their wonderful
old garden. The guests were all young University
friends of their daughters. Mrs. Simpson wore
black ring velvet, and the girls chose beige crepe
de Chine and floral georgette respectively.
To celebrate the coming of age of their daughter
Margaret, Mr. and Mrs. N. J. Hargrave entertained
a number of young people at the Wentworth, North-
terrace. The hostess was in black georgette and
lace. Margaret wore a smart frock of Lido blue
georgette with double skirt elfeot, and shoulder
straps of silver leaves. Her young sister, Jeanette,
chose a coral-pink organdie.
At the A.T.C. meeting at Cheltenham, chairman
J. H. Morish and his wife entertained at afternoon-
tea. Mrs. Morish was a girlish figure in black
cr6pe de Chine tailored coat with cape effect, worn
with a large white straw hat banded with black.
Scarlet in several tones was the popular shade;
Lido blue was also featured.
The Lady Mayoress opened the Auxiliary Fete at
Austral Gardens, and the Premier expressed the
opinion that, . after raising , £23,000 and making
thousands of articles for the Adelaide Hospital
wards, the members of the Auxiliary were entitled
to recognition. The Government, he added, was
planning as a centenary memorial a women’s hospital
on Frome-road. Mrs. Lionel Hill is the secretary
of the Auxiliary, so the Premier is likely to be
kept up to the mark.
At Glenalta, Stirling East, the Mount Lofty Boy
Scouts and Girl Guides held a successful fete in
the grounds. It was opened by Miss Wilson, Red
Cord Guide! from Imperial headquarters.
The charities of Adelaide deserve what they will
receive from the nine nights’ season of “The
Moon Dream” for their untiring efforts in selling
flowers and sweets night after night. At the conclu-
sion of the performance on the last night, Seymour
Pank was presented with a cheque.
A word from the West: —
Government House ballroom, with its spacious
galleries and vestibule, is just large enough to
house the exhibition of antiques. Exquisite china,
porcelain and silver have their place, and laces
and tapestries are as a monument to the patience
of our ancestors. One of the oldest exhibits
is a heavy iron box, under whose massive lock a
damsel of the thirteenth century used to keep her
diary and maybe her love letters. Neat fingers
labored over 21,000 pieces in the patchwork quilt.
The book section embraces a host of early religious
volumes, a Virgil, much too weighty for any school-
bag, and “Romanae Historic,” dated 1600. Among
the pi’iceless pieces lent by the Benedictine
Monastery at New Norcia are jewelled vestments,
old Spanish manuscripts, a Bible in very old
Greek, Latin and Arabic translations and
“San Jerome in the Cave,” an oil painting by
Ribera (better known as Spagnolotto), which the
Lord Abbot values at £15,000. The exhibition is
lasting a fortnight and lecturettes on appropriate
subjects are given at daytime and evening sessions.
For the hungry and thirsty a Staffordshire tea-
room, complete with blue-smocked maidens, has

’ Fair-headed Gladys McDaniell has become engaged
to Lewin Hadfield, who hails from the Apple Isle.
Ada Hemmant also wears a jewel upon her finger,
her fiance being John McDermott.
Word comes from the Harry Vowles couple, who
have been sauntering about Budapest and Vienna.
In London they had chats with Monty Brearley,
Norbert Coomber and Eileen Ralph, a trio of
musicians whose talents first sprouted in Perth.
Mr. and Mrs. Vowles will be home early in January.
Mrs. A. S. Cook and her sister, Mrs. Golledge,
organised 18 tables of bridge in their South Perth
home with its lovely river view, proceeds going
towards furnishings for the associates’ new room
at Perth Golf Club. A • few days later they donned
respectively figured pussywillow and apple-green
voile to welcome a flock of their friends to bridge
and tea.
Canon Parry has resigned from Christ Church,
and to welcome the new headmaster and Mrs.
Walters the Archibald Sanderson couple were at-
home at the Karrakatta Club. Mr. Sanderson said
a few words of regret at the old “head’s” departure

Go Orient to London!
17 NJOY the highest British standard of ships and service! On Orient liners,
L- 4 your well-being is studied m every way —in comfortable cabins and public
rooms; the ample freedom of great deck-spaces and the enticement of liberal and
varied catering. The efficient Orient Service is the result of more than 50
years’ experience. It is a true service whose object is not that you should go
“once Orient” but “always Orient.”
ORIENT LINE
A Mixed Bag.
“Cucaracha”: Paris, fed up with yo-yo,
has taken to a new and exciting game which
has the advantage over its predecessor of
being a sporting gamble. Imported from the
south of France, it consists m cockroach
racing. The course is 12 feet long and made
of glass partitioned into 10 lanes. The
cockroaches are placed at the starting gate,
and as this is lifted a brilliant light flashes
behind them. As the creatures hate light
as the Devil hates holy water, they sprint
instanter for the inviting darkness at the
end of the lanes. If the tin hare becomes
one with Nineveh and Tyre, politicians and
investors might find a profitable outlet for
their energies in the new sport. Even cock-
roaches couldn’t smell worse than the hare.
“Blue Chalk - ’: With the end of the year
approaching, billiards players in Britain
are wondering whether the experimental
“baulk line rule,” which expires on Decem-
ber Ml, will be continued. Though at the
beginning it cut down the excessively big-
breaks, as it was intended to do, even with
the topnotch players, it is evident that its
intricacies are mastered. At time of writ-
ing, McConachy, Newman and Lindrum have
topped the. 1000 mark. Lindrum on several
occasions. A new idea, put forward by
Nelson, the Yorkshire professional cham-
pion, is a rule compelling the scoring of a
winner, a loser and a cannon in every 100
hoisted. This he thinks will enforce all-
round billiards and banish monotonous
cannon and top-of-the-table play.
“Shrewsbury”: Australasian athletes did
well in the Oxford-Cambridge relay races
at Stamford Bridge last week. Davies, of
Geelong, won the half-mile low hurdles for
Oxford in Imin. 43sec., a record for these
events. With the Maoriland and Olympic
runner Lovelock, he also took the four-mile
relay.. Lovelock introduced an ultra-modern
touch. He had to sit for an exam, at
Oxford during the morning, and, after hand-
ing in his papers, flew to London just in
time to strip.
* * :1:
“Coif” : My latest copy of the Law Jour-
nal contains a very interesting decision by
Mr. Justice Sankey, of the English Queen’s
Bench, who clearly lays down what a lot of
us have suspected for years—that golf is,
under given circumstances, a public nuisance.
A player driving off from a tee adjacent to
a public road injured a taxi-driver with a
sliced ball. The taxi man sued for damages
and was awarded £450. The proprietors
of the club pleaded, as defendants, that
the cause of the action was the conduct
unauthorised by them of a third party, for
whom they were not responsible, this being
the player who launched the ball which
did the damage. The club said that it had
not invited or authorised the offending
player to send the ball on to the public
road—a pretty point in itself. Sankey found
that at common law the course in proximity
to a public highway constituted a danger to
the public and was, therefore, a public
nuisance.
“Brassey” : If the cables shortly announce
that the Rules Committee of St. Andrew’s
has been seized with a collective fit, don’t
be surprised. Speaking at the annual dinner
of the N.S.W. professional golfers, D. G.
Soutar said that too much value was placed
on putting, and that he for one would like
to see the holes enlarged or some other
method devised to make putting easier! It
was a staggering announcement coming
from one who is not only an accomplished
player but a Scot himself.
“Birkenhead Park”: Dominion players
took a considerable part in the victory of
Oxford over Cambridge at Rugby. Oxford
won 8-3—two tries and a goal to a try.
“Butts” Lamport, the N.S.W. scrum-half,
skippered the winning team and worked the
scrums in first-class fashion, starting the
moves which ended in the two tries, both
of which were scored by the Auckland
(M.L.)* winger Minns. Owen Smith, the
South African Test cricketer, also played
a great game at fullback for Oxford.
* *
“Stand off”: According to American
papers Rugby football is making steady
headway in the United States. In pre-war
days it was adopted by several of the Cali-
fornian universities, and in 1912 an Aus-
tralian team—the original Waratalis, by the
way—toured California, playing also in Brit-
ish Columbia. The Californians returned to
the American game because they could not
get opponents from the eastern universi-
ties. Things seem t© have changed, for it is
now stated that Yale, Harvard, Princeton
and Pennsylvania field regular Rugby teams,
while in New York alone there are a num-
ber of clubs.

“Toowong”: A notable event in Queens-
land rowing took place at Maryborough the
other day, when Norman Goodwin and his
Wide Bay crew staged their retirement from
rowing as a combination after continued
successes for years past, the latest being
the champion fours of Queensland in Bris-
bane recently. The veterans wound up well,
winning the big event of the regatta, the
Sullivan Memorial race, from fellow-clubman
Ridgeley’s crew.
* * *
“Blade” : Now that Mosman rowing club’s
long monopoly of the big events on the Parra-
matta River has been upset by the Sydney
club, more of the Sydney rowing organisa-
tions are returning to the senior ranks. Bal-
main and Old Newingtonians are cases in
point. It is not good for the game to have
one club attracting all promising rowing-
youngsters because of its success. The time
is coming when the rowing heads will have
to imitate the cricketers and footballers and
allot the (flubs definite boundaries, with a
residential qualification for members.
* * * *
“Ped.”: Crossing Bridge-street, Sydney,
the other morning I was nearly run over by
a car driven by a platinum blonde. The
driverine was nearly on me—l had the
right of way—when she momentarily flashed
a bejewelled paw to show she was going to
turn. I am in favor of the compulsory
instalment on all cars of a recent British
invention —an arm bearing an outsize
hand made of celluloid and illuminated from
within at night by a tiny electric bulb. A
control on the steering column operates this,
and all the signals possible to the human
arm are given, but much more impressively.
With this gadget women motorists would be
able to drive their cars with comparative
safety to the public, even if they were pat-
ting their hair into position with one hand,
as my platinum lady was doing.
“H'otham”: The Victorian Autocycle
Union has mapped out its programme for
the Australian Tourist Trophy race, to be
held on Phillip Island (Vic.) on January
30. The races will be: Senior Australian
T. T., 100 miles, entrance fee one guinea:
the Junior Australian T. T., 100 miles, one
guinea; Lightweight Australian T. T., 70
miles, 10s. 6d; Australian Sidecar T. T.,
50 miles, 10s. Gd. The Junior and Light-
weight events will be run together, and the
racing and results will be broadcast.
“Rev. Knucklebone”: Though reputed a
level-headed and non-temperameiital race,
there are evidences that Sydney Chinese
have become infected with the tennis mania
which has a great proportion of the city’s
population in its grip. Indeed, one Chinese
team is now playing in the C grade of the
Eastern Suburbs summer competition, and
is as keen as mustard. Already fair players,
they have showed themselves adepts at pick-
ing up new shots from other and better per-
formers. The little club consists of six men
and three women, and is the first Chinese
organisation of the kind in Australian tennis
history. A. Quoy is the star player, and is
a capable all-rounder.
“Amateur Pro.”: In a world given over
to the craze for sport some remarks by Jean
Borotra in a recent article in the “Christian
Science Monitor” come as gratefully as a
long beer at The Granites. Jean says, “A
big responsibility rests on sports writers
when they emphasise the importance of win-
ning championships, for they tempt players
into sacrifices which will be regretted when
the star has waned.... You are led to be-
lieve that you seriously matter.... If the
young player turns back on the path which
leads to playing fame he feels he is missing
his chance to become a world figure; if he
goes where the headlines lead him, he must
neglect his work. There will come a day
when the youthful idol is an idol no more.”
Bravo, the Basque!—and what he says
applies as well to cricket and some other
commercialised sports as it does to tennis.
“Cash Amateur”: No one cognisant of
the scarcely-veiled professionalism which
marks modern tennis will be surprised to
hear that the English L.T.A. is out to scotch
the evil. In future every player in English
open tournaments must, if the L.T.A. ha
its way, sign a declaration that he has no
interest in any firm supplying tennis equip-
ment. Also he will have to affirm that he
derives no cash' benefit from playing, receives
no hospitality save from private sources, and
no rebate beyond 40 per cent, reduction in
hotel bills.
“Amateur Pro.”: That reference to Helen
Madison turning professional before the
Olympic bays had withered on her brow, so
to speak (B. 9/11/’32), is one more argu-
ment in support of the contention that, save
in name, there is little of real amateurism
about the modern Olympic athlete in many
cases. It has recently been explained that
the extraordinary success of the Japanese
team in the swimming events was due to the
swimmers having trained for the event for
four years! It sounds a tall order, but is
an authoritative statement. No one, by any
stretch of the imagination, can say that that
sort of thing accords with the true spirit of
amateurism—a fast-vanishing quantity to-day.
* * * *
“Fitzcray”: Though she did nothing at
the Olympiad, Prances Bult has shown a
return to her old form in Victoria. The
other day she hoisted two new Victorian
records, doing, the 66 yards in 41sec., and
the 50 in 29sec., bettering the previous best
by l-ssec. The world’s record for the 50
still stands to the credit of Australian
Fanny Durack, who cut out the distance in
27sec. in 1914. The 66 is a distance not
recognised in world or Australian swimming,
though one or two of the States stage races
over it.
“Long-on”: Cleaning up debris at the
Sydney Cricket Ground the other day, the
authorities found a silver shield on which
were engraved the deeds of the IS7B Aus-
tralian XI. Harry Donnan, a son-in-law
of Ned Gregory, put light on the historic
emblem. The shield was presented to Dave
Gregory, captain of the 1878 team, who
handed it to his brother Ned as a solace
because Ned couldn’t make the trip. It was
hung in the cottage at the ground, and when
Ned died his widow gave it to the trustees.
During renovations the shield was taken
down and carelessly put aside. It is certainly
an antique which should have a place on the
walls alongside the fine collection of old
cricket records and relics pi the members’
stand.
“Hotham”: No need to go to mid-Vic-
torian England to find bird-of-paradise
cricket toggery (B. 2/11/’3l). When H.
H. Stephenson brought his team of profes-
sional players to Australia in 1862 under
the banner of the Melbourne catering firm
of Spiers and Pond, the first match between
an English and Australian team was played
on Melbourne Cricket Ground. The English-
men wore whit.e with a blue hatband and
a colored ribbon round each man’s arm
corresponding with the color given on the
scoring card. The Victorians were arrayed
’‘in straw-colored shirts with large scarlet
spots,” and the chromatic confection was
finished off with' a magenta hatband.
“Iconoclast” : Every day in every way I
am forced to the conclusion that inter-
national cricket has become a blithering-
obsession on which harmful consequences
may attend. One of the infernal accepted
half-truths which are worse than lies is
that such visits promote international amity.
■ I refuse to agree. The history of the modern
Olympic games has been one of increasing
ill-feeling among the competing nations.
Test cricket is taking on the same complexion.
Putting aside the yawpings of the Australian
dailies—and even sedate ones seem to have
thrown their bonnets over the windmill —•
let me refer to’ only two items in the
English papers. In one, Neville Cardus,
who has built up a reputation as a writer
on cricket, accuses the Sydney 0. G. autho-
rities of doctoring the pitch so as to prevent
Larwood and Voce doing their best! The
other item is contained in an editorial in
the “Manchester Guardian,” one of Eng-
land’s greatest dailies. This refers to the
Australians as ceasing to be “cock a hoop
attackers,” and refers to them as “the
enemy.” If that sort of thing promotes
amity then I’m a Lang-planner.
$ * * =i:
“Old Q.” : Deary me! It was quite like
a breath of old times to read a cabled tran-
script of a sentence in an article written by
Percy Chapman. Says Percy, “I visualise
much cogitation in the secret places of Aus-
tralian cricket regarding the problems of the
team.” That is real “stuff”-—literature as
we knew it on the “Rocky River Times.”
To-day I am bound to the chariot
wheels of a publication lousy with exigent
sub-editors. If Percy had handed in that
copy to the publication in question it would
have read something like this: “I can see
the blighters responsible for picking the first
Australian Test team doing their blocks
about the next.”

“If you’re feeling
RUN-DOWN
—get rid of self-
poisoning ”
urges Dr. C. Oppenheimer,
celebrated Berlin Physician
Read how to Banish “THAT TIRED FEELING”
Appetite gone. Vitality lacking. Subject to head-
aches, to frequent colds, to fits of “blues” so
many people are like that. . . .when they could so
easily be really well.
Self-poisoning Responsible
Modern methods of eating, lack of exercise cause
weakness and flabbiness of the abdominal organs.
Particles of decaying food waste are not completely
evacuated. This waste encrusts and accumulates
in the creases of the intestine, and harbors disease-
breeding germs, which enter the system and pollute
the blood. Result is dreaded self-poisoning, from
which nine out of ten suffer—caused by hidden and
unsuspected constipation. This self-poisoning spoils
the appetite—makes you feel weak and irritable. It
is the origin of constipation, indigestiofi, gas in the
stomach, catarrh, rheumatism, neuritis, eczema,
pimples, and hosts of other ailments.

Friendly Society Benefits
Dear Bulletin, —Many friendly-society
members have dropped out in recent years;
more will probably do so. The societies
could with advantage introduce the sur-
render-value principle of life assurance
(without cash-surrender and paid-up policy
values), using the clearance value as a
basis, and if need be keeping the member-
ship good as long as it lasts, any arrears,
with interest, to be a first charge on a claim
being payable. My own society, the 1.0. R.,
gives every, consideration to members, and
on application provides the contributions of
out-of-work members on their undertaking
to pay arrears when able. Other societies
no doubt do the same; but this is a conces-
sion. Were clearance values adopted as a
basis, each member would be treated on his
merits according to length of membership,
and nothing could be more equitable; by-
laws that provide for suspension of benefits
when 16 weeks are owing, regardless of dura-
tion of membership, leave much to fee
desired. Friendly societies may say the
surrender-value idea is impracticable. It is
just what assurance offices said 40 years
ago ; yet the system is now world-wide. An
actuary could easily devise a simple, safe
and equitable scheme, easy to instal. Pre-
sent members are entitled to a greater mea-
sure of protection, and posterity would be
the gainers also. —Yours faithfully, C. H.
Regelsen (Q.).
Backblocks Transport
One of. Australia’s many problems is
the co-ordination of State-owned railways
and private road-transport. An important
step towards solution has been taken by
the. English Dunlop Co.; its innovation,
which has. been tested in France, enables the
same vehicle to work on track and road.
The experiments were made with a motor-
’bus of ordinary type, with flanged trolley
wheels in front and at • the back of each
pneumatic-shod wheel. The job of these
wheels is to keep the vehicle on the rails
the actual running being done on the pneu-
matics. In case of a puncture, the flanged
wheels temporarily carry the weight. The
transfer from rail to road is simple. The
driver, presses a pedal which lifts the vehicle
—engine power assisting, of course—to a
height that enables the detachment of the
flanged wheels, which are carried in the
’bus while this is on the road. The trials
proved that the pneumatics provided a good
grip on the rails, and more effective braking-
power than metal wheels. Australia, with
its many semi-idle railway lines, might well
try this idea.
The Timber Industry
“Yen”: Major W. A. Bird, managing
director of Millars’ Timber, told Westralians
recently that, “jarrah is a wonderfully good
timber, but it is not the only hardwood on
the world’s markets; and there can be no
increase in overseas marketing until the
wide discrepancy between the price of jarrah
and that, of competing timbers is removed”
—the. principal competitors being English,
American and Japanese oak. Now, wage
rates have, been substantially reduced in
this industry, and there has been a solid
improvement in the men’s output; but
inspection charges, royalties, wharfage dues
and railway freights are all more than they
used to be, some of them double. Until these
charges are cut hard, a revival of the trade
seems hopeless. And what the industry means
or ought to mean we can judge by the fact
that even last. year, nearly a million pounds’
worth of foreign timber was imported.
Relief granted to Bung in Yic. under the
Landlord and Tenant (Rent Reduction)
Act, 1931, will total approximately £102,663.
Three years from last December is the limit
ot the respite. About 300 hotels are con-
cerned.

You can’t beat our own cypress pine for

The older English soap-makers—Lever’s
and others—are being challenged by
Proctor and Gamble, a big American firm,
which has joined with the English (New-
castle) firm of H'edley and Co., to build
new works alongside the Manchester ship
canal.

Although extensively used in Northern
Europe (and, of course, in Australia)
Bananaland turpentine timber is very little
known in Britain. Yet it was used in the
construction of the Panama Canal; and in
seven years’ test between it and American
greenheart the former proved less subject to
submarine pests and had an estimated life
of 40 years. Thanks to this advertisement
experts keenly awaited the recent arrival
of the Belpariel at Falmouth with supplies
for a dock. A marked increase in the Eng-
lish demand should follow.

“J.E.8.”: I engaged a temporary general
servant, and asked the Employers’ Federa-
tion of N.S.W-. how she stood in relation
to the Worker’s Compensation Act. I was
told she was probably not subject to the
Act, though a laundry-woman who comes
in for half a day each week is held clearly
to be. The Employers’ Federation advised
me to be on safe ground and insure my
temporary servant. With this object I
visited several insurance cos. and in every
instance was told there was no need to
insure. Now, if insurance cos. will not
issue a cover, or if they dissuade people from
insuring, it’s going to be hard on some
employer of a domestic if the servant meets
with an accident, sues and gains a verdict
for substantial compensation.

Lee Tracy in “The Power of Evil, ’ at
Sydney Haymarket, is a descendant of one
of the signatories of the Declaration of
Independence, and a newly-elected member
of the American Legislature. He realises
that he owes his election to a crooked deal,
but is determined, lone-handed, to oust the
crooks who have put him in, clean up
Washington, and then devote his attentions
to deodorising the U.S.A. His high-souled
speeches—or rather speech, for he says the
same thing at great length no fewer than
six times —had a twofold effect. They lett
Saturday night’s audience bored stiff and the
orator outside the House, his erstwhile friends
having got him out even more easily than
they got him in. Alan Dinehart is the
villain who, defeated by the forces of virtue,
is driven to suicide. Walter Connolly is
good as Dineliart’s dupe and grandfather ot
the lady in the case. Constance Cummings
is the lady. “The Riding Tornado” is
described as an “outdoor western. Inn
McCoy is he; Shirley Grey she. The shots
of the camp at the round-up and of the stam-
pede deserve a better story.

have been hidden by long contact with her
sister, are effective. So are Ralph Bellamy,
as a, kindly Dr. Ladd, and Alan Hale, in the
difficult character of the village freethinker.
George O’Brien cavorts through Zane
Grey’s “The Golden West” against an inco-
herent background of Kentucky feud, west-
bound waggon-train, buffalo-hunt, Indian
massacre, transcontinental railway-building
and more Indian uprisings. He doubles the
rOle of father and son. The father, having
lived through the Kentucky feud, is wiped
out when Indians descend on his pioneer
farmstead. His baby, brought tip by the
Indians, in the end unites the warring Ken-
tucky families by marrying the daughter of
his father’s first love. As Mr. O’Brien has
many opportunities of flaunting his magnifi-
cent he-mannish proportions he is supremely
happy.

“Faithless,” at Sydney State, is the latest
thing in depresh films—a harrowing concoc-
tion which is only saved from sheer banality
by Tallulah Bankhead and Robert Mont-
gomery. In boom times Tallulah had more
money than even she could spend. Robert
Montgomery, though he earned a mere 20,000
dollars per annum, had the nerve to ask
her to marry him in those halcyon days.
Naturally she refused, but when the
crash comes she looks him up, only to find
that he is ruined too. Both go lower and
lower financially, and then they marry and
struggle along as wage-plugs. Robert is
now assaulted by a gang of strikers and
lies at death’s door. The snow is falling,
there is no food or medicine in the house,
so off goes Carol as the newest recruit to
the oldest profession. She brings home the
groceries, but is saved from committing a
second offence by a friendly policeman who
gets her a job, and presently another job
falls out of Heaven for Robert. The smart
dialogue is a feature of this sordid movie.
In “Shop Angel” Marion Shilling imper-
sonates a talented female dress-designer with
an implicit faith in the goodness of mankind.
She wants to talk business with her licen-
tious boss, Holmes Herbert, so naturally
she displays her shapely figure to him. The
inevitable follows. The poor girl has to fight
desperately to save herself from a fate worse
than death, but she is rescued after nearly
committing suicide and almost setting fire
to the scoundrel’s flat. The audience tit-
tered in the grimmest parts. But there’s
always a demand for such nonsense.
“Cine Ma”: Thring appears to have
impressed London producers. A cable re-
ports that the whole output of Efftee Studios
to date has been booked for maximum dis-
tribution in the Cold Land. These include
"The Bloke,” “Diggers,” a George Wallace
short and the Barrier Reef series. Negotia-
tions are afoot for co-operation between
Thring’s concern and a big English co. for
the mutual production of an Anglo-Austra-
lian story, the scenario to be by an Aus-
tralian playwright.
“Bloggs”: English films will never score
with the present generation of Australians
till they get rid of the old-fashioned idea
that drunkenness is funny. Hollywood
grasped the point long ago. Scenes
showing stars getting more and more
blithered are lamentably common in most
English comedies, and in many dramas. Tom
Walls and Ralph Lynn spoiled one of their
funniest films with a tedious drink scene.
Frank Pettingell made 'Double Dealing”
even more lugubrious with a boozing sequence,
and Maisie Gay depends on the bottle for
half her laughs. She is doing all the revolt-
ing old business again in “The Old Man,”
at a Sydney theatre. The objections to
the portrayal of inebriation are not moral,
but artistic. The spectacle is hideous, and
in the nature of things it can’t be varied ;
drunks, like persons afflicted by sea-sickness,
never vary their methods.
“Cine Ma” : Add “Diggers” and “The Sen-
timental Bloke” to “On Our Selection” and
you have a trinity of Australian talkies
which have proved moneyspinners for their
promoters. “Diggers,” which goes shortly
to Maoriland, broke all records for both
silent and vocal films of any nationality in
several Melbourne suburban shops. It was
produced by Pat Hanna, of soldier-minstrel
fame, for Thring. Now that the burly
entrepreneur has left for the Old Smoke to
introduce his pictures to the British mart,
Hanna has leased his apparatus at His
Majesty’s, Melbourne, and is engaged on
“Diggers in Blighty,” a sort of sequel.
“Hamfat”: It is evidently the demand for
clear-speaking voices that has caused Adel-
aide-born O. P. Heggie to be lured into the
talkies; he appears as Dr. Owen in “Smiling
Thru’,” the excellent but inappropriately
named American talkie in which all the
voices are English, excepting the one that
in character has to have a touch of Yankee-
ism. When “The Message from Mars” was
permeating Australasia, the two principal
actors with Hawtrey were Gregan MacMahon
and Heggie.
The Palette,
The undaunted Murray Fuller, whose last
batch of English pictures went down with
the Manuka off the const of Maoriland in
1929, has returned with a fresh consignment
which is on view at the Vic. Artists’ Soci-
ety’s gallery, Melbourne. The highest
priced canvas (650 guineas) is “The Girl
in the Yellow Jacket,” by Augustus John.
The lady appears to have had her throat cut,
but is otherwise undistinguished. Orpen
is represented by a picture of a German
’plane passing over a group of English sol-
diers and French civilians; it belongs to
the cartoon class. Dame Laura Knight is
responsible for a vigorous impression of
dancers in a theatre.
“Meldrumite”: The characteristic of the
show of Max Meldrum’s latest Australian
work at the new Meldrum Gallery, Queen-
street, Melbourne, is concentration. The
canvases are smaller than the French land-
scapes. Within the smaller compass the
vision is more exact and the control more
thorough. All of the landscapes were
painted round Oliuda, and in some cases the
hour when they were painted is stated on
the catalogue. This is a test no artist who
works up his pictures in his studio would
care to submit to. All the pictures give
the effect of having been painted with a
continuous stroke of the brush. It looks
too easy, but it' is doubtful if Australian
landscape painting has ever been carried
further. The heavy shadows. of trees lie
across roads blazing with sunlight, and the
monotonous foliage of the gums and the
oistant mountains have been searched for
the maximum degree of variety. There is
the same effect of a single impression in the
only new portrait, a girl’s head, lit by arti-
ficial light from two directions. It is as if
the light itself had been used instead of
pigment to paint this singing picture.

“C.O.R” Plus has brought Australia into line with modem motoring
standards. Car owners everywhere are talking of it . . . They just
can’t help it. For never have they known such power, performance
and smoothness, such uncanny freedom from pinking. The modern

Overseas motorists have proved it—that’s why coloured “leaded”

AS WE SAID BEFORE
This page is. devoted to reproductions of the gems in picture, story
and verse published in “The Bulletin” of last century, so that
pleasant memories may be revived in old readers and a new
generation may enjoy the things that delighted an earlier one.
Macllaggis, an old squatter who for years
had starved and saved pound after pound
until he was known to be the richest and
stingiest ancient on the country-side, lay
dying. As he had neither kith nor kin, he
had been fawned on by many—women ogled
him, parsons intimidated him, bankers courted
him. lawyers pursued him—all to little pur-
pose. Lawyers were his special aversion:
two had bested him in a money transaction
years before, and he had to be revenged
before he died. He had made his will pri-
vately some time ere he fell ill, and when
lie felt the end approaching he sent for his
two legal enemies and asked them to be
seated, one on either side of his bed. Then,
affectionately taking a hand of each, he made
them promise to remain just as they were
until he died. This they undertook to do,
wondering the while what such a demonstra-
tion of reconciliation might signify. Presently
Sandy, liis eyes dim and his voice weak and
quavering, looked from one to the other and
said, brokenly: “Na doot ye’ll be wantin’ to
ken what this means? Weel, I thought I
should like to die just like our blessed Lord —
wi’ a thief on each side o’ me.” [ll/12/’97.]
A Westralian red-dust track; evening.
Swamper with- swag, camped, intently
gazing into fire. Footsteps in the distance:
second swamper appears, looking a degree
or two worse off; throws down his swag,
uninvited, with “Anything to eat, mate?”
“Nothing,” growls the first swamper, “only a
billy of tea.” “H’m !” says the other, “that’s
bad.” Presently, first swamper: “Any water
along the road?” Second swamper: “Yes,
I’ll show you how to'find it if you’re going
on. You see,” and he picked up a sapling
and drew a circle round the fire, “about ten
miles along there’s a paddock with a wire
fence.* Right in the centre of the paddock
there’s a dam ; that would be just here” —
and he dumped the sapling with all his force
in the middle of the fire. “Blast you,” yelled
the other, “you’ve squashed my damper!”
“No fear,” said the man with the sapling,
“you haven’t got any damper; you’ve only
got a billy of tea!” [ll/12/’97.]
A remarkable story of coincidence and
sailor-superstition was told by the sur-
vivors of the John Carey at Auckland. The
John Carey, a trading brig, ran into dirty
weather and sprang, a leak, which at last
forced the captain and five others to take
to the only boat left uninjured. They were
picked up by the Ladybird, another trader,
which -next day went ashore a total wreck.
Two days later a third trader, the Bright-
well, hove in sight, and being signalled by
the castaways sent a boat to take them off.
The John Carey’s
men were the first
to embark, and going
through the surf the
Brightwell’s boat
was upset and the
oc c u pants were
drawn on board half-
drowned. At this
disaster the Lady-
bird’s crew set up a
cry of “Jonah.” The
J.C.’,s people, they
said, had been twice
wrecked, and to em-
bark with them again
was certain death.
And so firm was
their faith in the old
superstition t h a t
when the Bright-
well sent a second
boat they actually
refused to be res-
cued, preferring to
stay where they
were and take their
chance of another
ship coming that
way to sailing in
company with a crew
of Jonahs! Accord-
ingly, the Brightwell
sailed away with the
six survivors, who
must have experi-
enced lively and
v a r i e d emotions
when, the very next
day, a heavy sea
broke on board,
stove one of the
boats and carried
away a portion of
the bulwarks ! How-
ever, the weather
cleared, an d the
much-harassed and
luck-tormented John
Careyites were even-
tua 11 y landed in
safety at Auckland. This recalls the
extraordinary train of events which fol-
lowed _ the loss in October, 1829, of the
Mermaid in Torres Strait. The crew
was picked up by the Swiftsure. Three
days later the Swiftsure was wrecked ; and
the two crews were saved by the Governor
Ready. The latter, being short of men, wel-
comed the additional hands, who signed on
there and then. On May 18, 1830, the Gover-
nor Ready was lost, and the three crews
were saved by the Comet. She shared the
fate of her predecessors, and the four crews
were: picked up by the Jupiter. Marvellous
to relate the Jupiter went ashore at Port
Raffles Harbor, and- the five crews, without
the loss of a man, got ashore in boats! One
of the original crew, then a very old man.
died some years ago at Sandridge (Melb.),
from whom, the writer obtained these facts.

When rumors first got out about the
silver-finds at Broken Hill, a well-known
Western squatter who thought of invest-
ing happened to mention the matter to a
Yankee stranger whom he was entertaining
for the night, whereupon the other, announc-
ing that he was a “silver expert,” advised
him instead to pitch his sovereigns into the
adjoining lake. “Then you’ll know where
they are, at all events, and perhaps even
get some of them back—which is more than
will happen if you put them iii Broken
Hill!” And the squatter allowed himself
to be thus choked off becoming one of the
original shareholders in the Proprietary
mine at £169 a share. One of these origi-
nal shares fell to the lot of a young Eng-
lishman who had become engaged to a girl
with £lO,OOO, and had come out to Australia
hoping to make an equivalent amount before
fulfilling the engagement. After trying all
sorts of things, he took to bookmaking, and,
when on his way to the Silverton races,
met a man who wanted to sell the share in
question. The Englishman proposed to
decide by a game of cards whether he should
give £l6O for the share or £l2O. He won.
and afterwards sold the share for £60,000
to a person who is now a millionaire.

When the benevolent Captain Machono-
chie ruled at Norfolk Island, the convicts
took advantage of his leniency, and, among
other things, they stole his choicest ducks,
which were under the care of a half-witted
TAKEN IN TOW.
(Als Vincent — 22/7/ ’93.)
“Mr. Peterswald, the S.A. Commissioner of Police,
has expressed his entire satisfaction at the result of
the experiment of mounting a portion of the police
force on safety bicycles.”
fellow known as “Stuttering Billy.” Every
otli.er day or so, Billy came back with a
diminished charge, till the captain at last
got “mad,” and gave Billy half a dozen.
But the same thing happened again. . Billy
asserted that they "fioo-o-ed away,’ and
was tied up again. But still the ducks
went, till none remained. “Tlie blanky
d-d-u-cks, sir,” reported Billy, “fell in-in-ter
th’ cr-ereek, and wa-s dr-dr-ownded.” At
which the captain was so tickled that, he let
Billy off his usual allowance. Billy lived to
be “respectable” in Hobart, and to be known
as “the duck-drowner.” [4/12/’97.1
When Bully Palmer was Premier of
Queensland he visited Maryborough and was
driven round by Nick Tooth, the .Mayor. On
passing the English church and the peal-of-
bells tower “erected to the glory of God
and the memory of Mrs. Aldridge,” Palmer
asked, “What’s this Old lighthouse?” “That
is a peal of bells,” said Tooth. "Where the
Hades'did you get the money from?” "Oh,
that was a present from the late Mr. Ald-
ridge.” “What! Old Teddy?” “Yes,” said
Tootli. “Ah, well, a damned heavy fire-
insurance, but it. won’t save him !” observed
Palmer as he drove away, f2/10/’97.1
They were mates, and had been such for
years. Respective names, Bill and Jim.
Bill was chief, pilot and did all the
“magging.” Jim corroborated Bill's state-
ments —when appealed to by Bill. Other-
wise he was respectfully silent. Shearing
at Fleeceback’s was over, and before “doing
in” their cheques at Cleanout’s pub, they
(Bill) decided to renovate their travelling
paraphernalia at Hooker’s general store.
They had two drinks meanwhile, then began
the ' renovating part of their programme.
Bill did the buying. Jim was not consulted,
but was satisfied. Bill thought they eofild
do with a new tucker-bag,
and said so. Jim agreed.
Old Hooker produced the
material needed for build-
ing the' article, also remark-
ed that a yard would suffice.
Bill concurred. Jim did not:
for the first time in eight-
years he disputed the point,
and said it would take “a
■yard an' a uarf.” Bill was
tliundersfricken at Jim’s ■
audacity; told him lie was
always putting in his “mag.”
always nagging and growl-
ing. Ho (BUI) knew how
much it took to make a
tucker-bag. Anyhow, the
chap behind the counter

better scholar than him
(Jim). Jim still reckoned
that it would take “a yard
an’ a narf.” Whereupon
Bill unbosomed hims e 1 f
thus: “Don’t speak to me!
I’ve had enough of yez!
Shut up; yer no good!
Yer know where yer
swag is, and I know where
mine is! Wouldn’t tramp
another mile with
yer!” The mates prepared
to bash each other. Hooker
interfered at this stage, find Jim left. Ten
minutes later they met up the street and
agreed to “stand” each other for another
trip Outback. |B/5/’97.]
On a Hillston (Lachlan, N.S.W.) station
a blackfellow earned his rations by
catching fish. The storekeeper was the
man to whom he generally took his
basket for acceptance. Storekeeper: “Well,
.Tacky, what fish to-day?” Jacky: “Baal,
big fellow lot this time.” Storekeeper:
“How many you -got?” .Tacky: “Only
five.” Storekeeper: “What you want for
them?” Jacky (spreading the fish out
in a line) : “I tink tsugar belonging that
feller; blour belonging that feller; tea be-
longing that feller; bacca longa that teller.
Pause. Storekeeper: “Well, what you wanta
longa last one —the big fellow?” Jacky
(scratching- his head) : “Oh, I tink it whisky
belonging that feller.” [ll/12/’97.J
A Sydney draper prints a text right
across his billheads, and immediately beneath
his own name. An invoice reads after this
fashion: “Mrs. Cash. Bought of ———,
family draper and importer. ‘What must I do
to be saved?’ Served by 29. Examined by
A.T. 2 pairs stockings, 9d. Paid, with
thanks.” [lB/12/’97.]
Frank Stubley and some friends were in a
bank handing over a huge cake of gold, which
they had just hoisted on to the counter, when a
little, fragile woman, addressing Frank, said :
“Excuse me, sir, but is that all really gold?’
“Every bit of it,” replied bluff Frank; “and
if you can take it away you may have it.
The little woman looked inquiringly _at
Stubley. who, interpreting her glance, said :
“Yes, I really mean it —-take it away your-
self and it’s yours.” Letting go the hand
of the boy who was with her, she went
forward to try, but at such a height it was
utterly immovable, and with evident regret
she at once abandoned the task. “Do you
know who she is?” asked one of those
present. “No,” replied Stubley. “That’s the
widow of Johnny *” [mentioning the name
of a miner who had been killed by a fall
on the field some months previously] “and
the cake would just have suited the little
the cake would just
have suited the
little woman.” “By
!” said Frank
Stubley, “I mn
sorry to have teas-
ed her with the
cake like that. I
wouldn’t have done
it for anything if
I’d known.” And
that very moment
he devoted to her
aid £lOO out of
the proceeds of the
cake. Frank Stub-
ley, mocked by for-
tune, lies at rest
beneath a tree on the road to Croydon,
where, even on his dying day, he was on a
golden track. [3O/5/’9l.]
Phil May, says The Bulletin’s London
correspondent, is in enormous demand just
now, and there is the keenest competition
amongst the illustrated papers to secure his
services. An ordinary man might easily be
spoiled by such popularity as he enjoys, but
not so Phil, whose modesty is in proportion
to his great ability. There is no such thing
as vanity about him, and jealousy is an
unknown quantity in his composition. ITis
studio in Holland Park Gardens is the ren-
dezvous of numbers of young black-and-white
artists, whom he is ever ready to help on.
He must now be making a very large income
indeed. [lB/3/’93.j
OTHELLO’S OCCUPATION.
SCHOOLMA'M : “And what does your father do?”
NEW BOY: “He drinks.” (“Hop” —2/9/'93.)
Unemployed men are now applying for
billets as housemaids and indoor servants.
A lady who runs a large boarding-house
advertised for a servant; three men applied
for the job, but she explained that she
wanted a housemaid. She engaged a girl
who didn't suit, and the lady advertised
afresh. Two men answered the first day,
and so impressed was she by the persistence
of the appeal of one that he was engaged.
The boarders were astonished next day to
find a fine-looking young man established as
a regular indoor slavey, attending to the
bedrooms, sweeping and dusting, etc., and
his mistress says her “new man” gives her
every satisfaction. [24/7/’97.]
GERMAN JOE.
Skirting the swamp and the tangled scrub,
Tramping and turning amidst the trees,
Carrying nothing but blankets and grub,
Taking no heed of liis health or ease,
Hither and thither with never a goal,
Heavy, and solemn, and stiff, and slow',
Seeking a track and a long-lost line.
“Blazed avay to dot lead of mine,”
Restljss and rickety German Joe.
Down in the gully and up the range,
Stung by the gale and the hate-hot sun,
Never a greeting to give in change,
Never a tip from the nearest run,
Seeking a guide to a golden hole,
Lost in the lone land long ago,
Left in the keep of the hills and trees—
Jealous to have and to hold are these,
Hope you may get it, though, German Joe!
Likely old yarn for a darned marine!
Struck it, you say, at the river head —
Back where the bellowing bunyip’s seen,
Out beyond everywhere—rich and red :
Left it for tucker, and lost the track,
Blazed till your arm couldn’t strike a blow.
Gravel that gleams with the golden stuff,
Nuggets “shust like as der plums in duff”—
What are you giving us, German Joe?
Blaze? Yes; you strike for the Granite
Stair,
Make to the left when you cross the creek,
South till you meet with a monkey-bear,
Tramp in his tracks for about a week;
Then you can travel the skyline back.
So long, old chap, if you’re bound to go.
Don’t you forget when you’re rich and great
Who laid you on to the lost lead, mate —
Mad as a hatter is German Joe.
Laugh as they may, they will stand his
friends,
Right as rain when the old man takes
Down to liis bunk in the hut, and spends
Seven weeks fighting the fever and shakes,
Muttering still of his lucky lead:
“Vliisper—l leds you all in der know,
1 ten you pe richer nor as der pank.”
Boys, he’s a man if he is a crank—
Whisky and physic for German Joe.
SAUCE FOR THE GOOSE, ETC.
SQUATTER'S SON: “My father told you not to camp on his
property, Neddy.”
KING BILLY'S SON: “My father yabber your father lika that.”
(Frank P. Mahony —21/10/’93.)
Now lie’s abroad in a wild dream-land,
Baring his breast to the river breeze —
Out where the rock-ribbed ranges stand
Whispering his tale to the secret trees
Hither and fro with a phantom’s speed,
Over the plains where the mad winds
b10w....
Cover his face now, and carve a stone,
Henceforth his spirit must seek alone—
Dead as a doornail is German Joe.
Bushmen have yarned of a ghost that went
Blazing a track from the Granite Stair
Down to a shaft and a tattered tent.
Many days’ journey from anywhere.
Others have said that the bushmen lied.
Liars or not, it is true, we know,
Men have discovered a golden mine
Out in the track of an old blazed line,
Led by the spirit of German Joe.

Why the new English-made
Gillette Slotted Blades
are sharper and smoother shaving
than any safety razor blades produced before

THIS WAS
THE PROBLEM
Heretofore the hard-
ness of the steel in the
3-hole blade has been
necessarily more or less
uniform throughout
the blade. Particular
care was required to
prevent the steel in
the centre of the blade
from being too brittle,
otherwise the blade
would crack along the
line A-B. The result
was that the steel at
the edge C-D was
only just so hard as was
possible to have it in
the centre of the blade,
i.e., the edges of the
blade were necessarily
sacrificed to the centre.
ONE of the most important reasons why
the new English-made Gillette blades
give shaving of greater smoothness than
any other blade, is because the slot in the
new Gillette blade permits the use of steel
of a finer temper than has ever been obtain-
able in a safety razor blade heretofore.
This tempering process makes the cutting
edges exceptionally hard, whilst the centre of
the blade, of a different temper, flexes easily
and does not crack in the holder.
In addition to this special process, a com-
plete new edging plant, with all the latest
engineering developments, has been installed
in the Gillette London factory, so that the
new Gillette slotted blades now on sale give
the public utmost service and value. You can
distinguish these new blades in the shop by
the words “Made in England” on the packet.

THE
SOLUTION
OF THE
PROBLEM
The slot in the New
Gillette Blade makes
it possible to have soft
steel in the end sec-
tions of the blade G-H
(permitting easy flex-
ing) and yet have hard
steel at the edge E-F.
This is because with
the slotted blade the
annealing heat which is
applied to the section
G-H is prevented from
affecting the steel at
the edge E-F.

The Gavel-Eaters.
BY DAVID McKEE. WRIGHT.
THE rain fell with a steady persistence
outside the cave and threw a hazy
veil over the terrace below. All night
it had been as music in Hooper’s ears; but
now the sodden morning seemed to depress
the spirits which should have exulted in
the downpour. The four waterless days of
his ride across the Blue Shot Plain had
brought him to this haven of refuge in an
oasis of rocky hills and green trees. A
little stream of clear water had led him to
the cave—a large roomy place with a white
sandy floor, overhung with creepers at the
lower end, and with one narrow opening
which ran into the darkness. Somebody
had camped there before him, for there were
signs of a fireplace, and an empty tin
match-box lay in the sand. It was a good
shelter and saved him the trouble of pitch-
ing a tent. Rain was already falling when
lie reached it.
Hooper replenished his small fire and
placed the billy over it. He strode up and
down the cave, slightly bending his head
to save it from contact with the stone roof,
though it was actually a foot above him.
Outside he heard the clink of a hobble-
chain, showing that the horses were still
close at hand. He had hobbled the white-
faced bay, and the others would stay with
him.
“Two hundred miles from the outer edge
of things and then blocked by rain!” he
muttered.
He had entirely forgotten how nearly he
had been blocked by the far more serious
obstacle of lack of water while crossing the
plain; but the desire to push on into mineral
country and give luck a chance to surprise
him made him restless. Presently he walked
out into the rain holding his hands palm
upwards to test its volume and intensity.
Then he threw a piece of oilskin over his
shoulders, like a cape, and sauntered forth.
The wall of limestone rock above the cave
rose almost perpendicularly on the right
bank of the creek. The ground was covered
with tumbled fragments of. stone, and among
these a sparse growth of young saplings
added to the difficulties of the way; but he
worked his path upward until the stream
entered a kind of gorge, and there he came
upon the track.
At first Hooper thought that it was
simply a pad made by animals constantly
passing and repassing. But a moment later
he dismissed the idea; for clear before him
lip the face of the cliff were steps hewn in
the rock. Somebody must actually live
in this outlandish spot or must have lived
here until very lately. He was no mere
temporary camper either, judging by the
trouble lie had taken to cut those steps.
Hooper stood still for a moment and his
baud went mechanically to the bulge in his
hip-pocket where the small automatic pistol
lay. He had no reason to be afraid, but
there was something not quite reasonable
about finding a permanent resident on the
other side of the Blue Shot Plain. A man
must have done something to plant himself
out here. A prospector’s camp would have
been an entirely different matter.
He looked in the direction of the cave
and again towards the steps. Then, swing-
ing the rain from his hat, he hunched his
shoulders and began to climb.
The top of the cliff did not prove to be
the top of the hill; for the path led on
between great shoulders of rock to more-
steps, and these to yet others. At last he
stood on the summit and gazed through the
thick misty drizzle on what appeared like
a basin of dense forest interspersed with
pinnacles and peaks of limestone. No house
was in sight ; and it seemed to Hooper that
whoever had made his lair in this strange
place must have been in search of very
secure hiding. Once more he was assailed
by that feeling of uncertainty, and looked
back in the direction he had come ; and once
more lie turned and followed the track.
The limestone boulders to right and left
now assumed fantastic shapes. At one place
a column rose to a height of thirty feet
or more, almost regular in form and slender
as the stem of a tree; at another three
tall mushroom-like shapes stood out against
a background of intense green. There were
tables, altars, pyramids and tombstones
caused by the action of some natural force
in ages gone by, and, among these, still more
grotesque shapes, standing like caricatures of
man and beast.
The path took a sudden turn and followed
a narrow defile between two high walls of
rock which almost met overhead; and,
threading his way through this passage,
Hooper came suddenly upon the village. In
utter amazement he gazed upon ordered
squares of garden and orchard, which seemed
to group themselves round an oval of green
grass where stood seven or eight buildings.
The green was dotted with trees and criss-
crossed with little paths,- but there was
nothing in sight which looked like a road.
The buildings were of a very unusual
kind, large and low, with broad verandahs,
but with flat roofs and showing no sign
of any windows. He looked in vain for
sheep, horse or cow. No domestic animal
was in sight, and nowhere could he see
any human being.
“Queer!” lie said. “I’m hanged if I
know what to make of it. Must be deserted;
yet it all looks in going order.”
The rain had almost ceased when he
reached the first line of cultivation. In
puzzled wonder lie looked at the orchard
trees planted in straight rows. Their leaves
were as large as those of fig-trees and of
the glossiest green. They were covered with
bright blue flowers and small fruit of all
shades from pale green to a crimson that
was nearly black.
“Some ' sort of newfangled stuff,” lie
muttered. “Some chap has got away out here-
to run a nursery in secret before he puts
the trees on the market.”
Hooper did not feel that the explanation
was quite satisfactory; but before lie could
make a second guess he was arrested by
the sound of singing. A sudden volume of
sound poured from the largest of the build-
ings—a loud chant in which hundreds of
voices seemed to join.
“Sunday!” he said. all at
church.”
But was it Sunday? No: as far as he
could fix the day, it was Wednesday.
The singing stopped as abruptly as it had
begun, and Hooper walked mechanically on
across the green towards the building from
which it had come. He had nearly reached
the broad verandah and was observing that
it was supported by pillars of rough-hewn
stone when he paused at a sudden cry. It
was a long-drawn-out musical call thrice
repeated and sounded like “Al-ee-100-yee!”
“Coo-ee!” Hooper shouted in return.
There was a clamor of voices within the
building; and sudden life swarmed and
surged in the verandah. Hundreds of
people, men, women and children, rushed out
upon the green, waving long sprays of some
white flowering plant and calling in rich,
bird-like voices. All were dressed in a single
simple garment, which fell from below the
shoulders to the knee, and all wore the
same clustering ringlets of golden hair and
the same complexions of rose petals and ala-
baster.
“I must be dead,” thought Hooper. “They’re
angels out of a picture, all but the wings.”
That lie was really frightened now he was
ready enough to admit to himself. His mind
seemed to whirl and he felt his limbs tremb-
ling.
But the crowd, moving as gracefully as
Greek dancers, had formed a complete ring
about him, and the seeming confusion had
grown into a kind of stately order.
A tall man with a larger spray of flowers
than the rest took a stand before him and
began to speak.
“It is the messenger of the world come
at last. Hear him. His speech may be
strange, his words may seem rough as the
bark of trees or the crow-cries over the hills,
but on every word hangs the threefold magic
of the was, the is, and the must be. Hear
him and be wise!”
“Oh Lord!” said Hooper. “What’s it
all about?”
“Hear him,” said the man with the
flowers.
“Look, I don’t want to talk. I only
want to know. I rode across the Blue Shot
Plain before it came on to rain. Don’t tell
me I died there? Who are you, anyhow?
Is this Heaven, or where?”
“Hear him ! Hear him !”
“Oh, stop hearing me and answer some-
thing. Who are you?”
“We are the eaters of the gavel fruit.
Thrice blessed be the gavel fruit for ever
and ever.”
“Then I’m still alive, am I?”
“You are alive.”
“What sort of fruit is it? That stuff I
saw growing as I came along?”
“Love, joy, youth and mirth are in the
gavel fruit. Once in every day we eat it
with song. Through it we grow .strong, by
it we are wise, with it we are happy.”
Hooper was now feeling more at home.
The crowd had closed in upon him, and he
saw that every face was smiling'.
“Sounds good to me,” he said. 1 d like
to taste the stuff.” .
“You shall eat." cried the man with the
big branch.
“Pie shall eat,” cried the crowd in chorus.
“Back to the temple, and sing as we go.
said the leader.
Hooper found himself in the centre of a
group of laughing girls who seemed to push
him forward. He could not catch the words
of their song, but the lilt was quite familiar.
If they had kept to the old “Here we come
gathering nuts in May” he felt that it would
have been perfectly suitable to the occasion.
The house, which had been described as
the temple, was large, white and bare, but,
decorated with the scented throng which
now poured into it from seventeen doors, it
seemed like a close garden of pink and
golden flowers. On a small stone table lay
a large leaf covered with deep crimson fruit
of small size.
“Eat and be glad,” said a rich musical
voice.
Hooper put a fruit to hi.s mouth.
This time there was no doubt about tin-
words of the song that shook the white
walls.
“For lie's a jolly good fellow,” sang young
and old with a heartiness that exactly suited
the taste of the fruit.
In the pause which followed, Hooper’s voice
rang out clear and full.
“Beer!”. he said. “It’s the beer-tree
you’re growing. I can do with any amount
of this.”

He reached his hand again across the
table, but a young girl laid her fingers on
his wrist.
“One,” she said, “for joy; two or more
for confusion.”
“I’m for confusion all the time,” said
Ilooper.
“One is food for one day,” said the girl.
“Let him eat,” said the stronger male
voice that had first spoken.
Hooper finished the fruit laid on the leaf
and swayed genially on his feet.
“It’sh a feash for the godsh,” he shouted.
“Fill ’em up again, Missher Angel!”
“Attend to his needs, Miriam and Azubah.
He will sleep well and rise refreshed. See
that he has suitable raiment, and lead him
to the waters when he awakes.”
Hooper smiled foolishly on the departing
throng and leaned towards the girl at his
side. He was fast asleep when they laid
him on cushions in the wide verandah and
sat, one at his head and the other at his
feet, softly fanning him with great green
leaves.
All the afternoon, while the gavel-eaters
worked and sang in their orchards and
among their flowers, he lay breathing heav-
ily and dreaming the good prospector’s
dreams of mountains of gold and continents
of silver ore. At sunset he wakened joy-
ously drunk and full of kindness.
He swam in the great bathing-pool, and
walked under the trees which the warm
afternoon sun had dried. He applauded the
dancers in the torchlit ring on the grass
when they worked out in rhythmic move-
ment their quaint dramas of a gavel-eater’s
life, and joined in the choruses of the songs
which the whole community sang.
In the morning he made the great dis-
covery that his hair had turned golden, and
was already six inches long. Lightly clad
in a thin dress that fell from below his
shoulders to the knee, he walked about in
a mild ecstasy, neither drunk nor sober, but
altogether in love with his surroundings.
The two girls were less closely in attend-
ance now. They took it in turns to be with
him, and presently the duty was left to
Azubah alone. That evening Hooper
matched himself in a footrace three times
round the green with two of the best run-
ners among the gavel-eaters, and won by a
yard the wreath offered as a prize.
On the third day, perfectly sober, he
worked beside the chief apostle of the gavel-
eaters in the orchard and learned the simple
gospel of their creed. Of the history of the
gavel he was not yet to know until his hair
had attained a length of seventeen inches —
seventeen, he discovered, was the mystic
number among them.
The properties of the gavel were, how-
ever, no mystery. A single fruit eaten daily
amid song and gladness supplied the place
of all other food. It gave perfect health
and perfect content. More than one fruit
produced intoxication. The desire of the
gavel-eaters was to carry the fruit to the
world, but hitherto the barrier of the Blue
Shot Plain had foiled all attempts. Those
who ate the gavel required to drink much
water. It was impossible to carry enough
water for the journey.
To Hooper it was all an amazing tale,
hut he saw possibilities in it that the simple
gavel-eaters missed. Here was the gold-
mine he had sought. What price fresh
gavels on the markets of Sydney and Mel-
bourne? Perhaps the fruit would carry to
distant markets to gladden .Chicago and New
York! The rum fleet could furl its sails
and scrap its funnels when once seeds of
that pleasant plant had taken root in Ameri-
can soil! In the meantime a second-hand
car with a small tank of water might lay
the foundations of the finest little trade in
the world.
The apostle put it fairly to Hooper. He
was the messenger for whom all gavel-eaters
had waited. The only deaths recorded
among them had been caused by excess of
longing for his appearance. Would he now
undertake his great mission of saving the
world by gavel?
“My oath!” said Hooper; and the apostle
honored the solemn pledge by calling on the
gavel-eaters to make holiday for the rest of
the afternoon.
Next morning Hooper was escorted with
song and waving flowers along the path to
the top of the stone steps, which led to the
world. He had urged this early start for
several reasons, the chief among'them being
the feeling that if he stayed ionger he might
become as mild a gavel-eater as the rest.
Another reason was Azubah. Azubah was
a very charming girl; and Alice, who lived
in Charleville, might not care for hei\
Hooper wanted to get his goldmine working
as soon as possible.
He had . four gavels in his pocket—one
for. each day of his journey back to civili-
sation ; and when he kissed Azubah at the
top of the cliff her last tender whisper re-
mained in his ear. J *
“One at a time,” she said, “one at a time.”
Gaily whistling as he went, he reached the
cave in the rocks and looked round for the
horses. They were nowhere to be seen; and
he began a leisurely search for them. They
would not leave the white-faced bay; and the
hobbles would keep him from straying far.
But Hooper’s leisurely search became keener
when he discovered a broken hobble-link by
the creek. It was snapped where there was
a flaw in the metal, and by the look of the
rusted break it was a marvel that it had
held together so long.
An hour later, the missionary of the gavel-
eaters, no longer whistling, found horse
tracks on the plain. The recent rain had
sufficiently softened the ground to make the
hoof marks distinct. All the horses had
been there —apparently going at a canter.
“They won’t stop _ till they reach Dead
Camel Creek,” he said, and sadly returned
to the cave. Remembering Azubah’s advice,
he ate one gavel and sat down to consider
his plans.
“A motor-car ought to come along some
time,” he murmured —“a motor-car or an
aeroplane or something.”
Vaguely he wondered whether the horses
would be seen by any one who recognised
them. He considered all the possibilities
with perfect calm.
“Eat one at a time,” he said, and took
another gavel.
The plain looked very wide and very hot.
He remembered Azubah with her scented hair
falling about her rose-petal cheek.
“Beaut’ful beer tree,” he sighed. “Only
one at a time.” He put the third gavel to
his lips. “Great scheme, beer-mine.”
From the high cliffs the apostle of the
gavel-eaters watched to see the messenger of
the world’s salvation ride out with his pack-
horses over the bare waterless plain.' At his
side the lovely Azubah lay full length on the
rocks, her chin between her shapely hands,
wondering about the world that lay in the
haze beyond. The sun climbed up towards
the top of the sky.
Hooper, moving ih a restless day-dream, in
which he was sinking a shaft on beer that
went six hogsheads to the ton, reached for
the fourth gavel. >
His golden curls were nearly seventeen
inches long.
And a Word with You
NOW on this last page The Bulletin
may be allowed to say. a few words
about itself, trying to sum up what
it has done since its last Christmas Number,
and what it plans to do in the coming twelve
months.
A year ago it had just moved into its new
home; and it undertook to use the great
building—-six floors and two basements, with
a depth of over 300 ft. —;to- do. larger things
for Australia, and especially, to begin with,
for art and literature in Australia.
It found an early opportunity to do some-
thing for art. In the larger cities of the Com-
monwealth galleries had been' set up for the
occasional exhibition and sale of Australian
pictures. But what The Bulletin wanted
to see was a permanent exhibition —a gal-
lery to which the public might come at all
times sure of finding a collection of oil and
water-color paintings, etchings and pen and
ink drawings, representing every artist of
any consequence, and, as far as possible, all
periods of Australian art. A floor was con-
verted to this purpose ; a gallery 150 ft. long
and nearly 50ft. wide, every part of it
lighted from above, was built, and put in
charge of Mr. G. V. F. Mann, who had been
director of the National Gallery. Here Mr.
Mann gathered a thoroughly representative
collection of Australian art; and since it
was opened at Easter it has had upwards
of 20,000 visitors. For the most part, the
pictures are for sale; they vary in price
from hundreds to a pound or two; and sup-
plementing the pictures is a collection of
arts-and-crafts work, which it is planned to
increase.
The gallery is so built that it can be
divided into bays; and one or more of these
are available for any art society desiring
to hold a special exhibition of its members’
work ; or it is available for any approved
artist. Nothing is charged for the use of
the gallery, nor is any guarantee demanded:
if sales are made a small commission is col-
lected. Norman Lindsay, who occupied two
bays in November, was the most successful
exhibitor during the year: he sold 58 pic-
tures. Of artists who did not hold a special
show Robert Johnson had the greatest suc-
cess ; 12 of his paintings have been sold.
The gallery is open free to the public
from 10 to 4.30 five days a week and from
10 to 12 on Saturdays. Dates for special
exhibitions are now being booked for next
year.
The gallery having been established —
it was named the Macleod, after The Bul-
letin’s late art editor for 30 years—atten-
tion was turned to the writer. Five years
ago, having seen an Australian school of
short-story writers safely launched, The
Bulletin set out to do something for the
long story. Among other thiiigs, it paid away
more than £2OOO in prizes for Australian
novels. Over a score of the stories entered
for these competitions have been published;
some of them —“A House Is Built” and
“Coonardoo,” for example—have had great
success abroad. But The Bulletin believed
it to be of the utmost importance that Aus-
tralian literature should be published in
Australia. Even though outstanding fiction
might find a publisher in England or
America, it was clear that, without a strong
publishing house in Australia, other books
that ought to be issued —scientific, historical
and biographical, for example—would not
be published at all. And, anyhow, it was
certain that if the Australian novel could
not find a publisher in Australia, then the
Australian novelist would go abroad to be
near his market. Mr. P. R. Stephensen, who
had gone from Australia to Oxford as a
Rhodes scholar, thought as The Bulletin
did on this matter; and when he had com-
pleted his studies with honors at Oxford,
he set out to learn the publishing business.
Returned to Australia three months ago, he
satisfied The Bulletin that he wds the
collaborator for whom it had been looking.
The Bulletin thus placed its resources at
the disposal of a new enterprise, the Aus-
tralian Book Publishing Co.; and already
a start has been made with production. The,
new co.’s headquarters will be in the Bulletin
Buildings, 252 George-street, Sydney.
The eo. will cover the whole field of book
publication. It aims to provide the Aus-
tralian public with one good novel a month.
But the novel will be only one branch of its
work. Already 350 other MSS. have been
submitted. Some of these, especially those
on the scientific and historical side, are of
great interest. The co.’s aim will be to
prove that science and history can be made
as interesting as fiction. Besides original
novels, there will be occasional reprints of
stories that have gone out of print—Louis
Stone’s “Jonah” w’ill be an early offering.
As for Tile Bulletin, “Woman’s Mirror,”
and “ ‘Wild Cat” Monthly,’ ” they can b
left generally to speak for themselves. They
are all better papers than they were a year
ago; they will be better papers a year hence 1
than they are to-day. They never stood so
high in public regard: the aim is to place
them still higher during the year. And that
can only be done by service. The desire of
the people who are responsible for The
Bulletin and its associate enterprises is
to get into close touch with their readers and
other supporters, and from them they will
always be glad to receive suggestions of
ways in which greater or better service can
be rendered.


Why Micawberise?
“Waiting for Something to turn up" was what Mr. Micawber,
the famous Dickens character, was noted for
Are you waiting for something to turn up, or are you making something turn up? For 1933 are you adopting a Micawber-like attitude
of mind, or are you going to make 1933 a new period of prosperity in your life? There is only one way in which you can improve
your position, your earning capacity, your happiness, during 1933; that is to make yourself fit for more responsibility, for a bigger
position, which means more money; both of which form the natural background of happiness? To make yourself fit, you will have to
drop Micawberising and make things turn up. This you can do*, if you will, by setting yourself a definite course of study in a subject
that will help you to advance in your business.
Hemingway and Robertson, under their personal Individual Tuition Method, can help you to attain any business ambition you set
yourself for 1933. For 36 years H. & R. have trained Australian men and women for their careers in business. If you like, they can
train you. If you are just starting in business they can train you for whatever position you desire to attain. If you are already in
business they can train you for better and more remunerative work.
Hemingway and Robertson are career specialists in business subjects. '
Accountancy and Secretarial Practice.
Throughout the Commonwealth, Hemingway and Robertson are known
as the most successful coaches in all phases of Accountancy and Cost
Accountancy. H. & R. students have secured, for the past 10 years, the
greatest percentage of Major Honors in all the Accountancy Institute
examinations
In conjunction with Accountancy is Secretarial Practice. Here again,
11. & 11. students secure the greatest percentage of Major Honors for the
Secretarial Institute Examinations.. This is proof that the H. & R.
Persona] Individual Tuition Method and Service is “right” from the
student's point of view. What others have done in this matter, you can
do if you will let Hemingway and Robertson advise and instruct you.
Business Correspondence.
A most important factor in all our business relationships is Effective
Letter-writing. Through it custom is influenced, accounts collected, goods
sold, complaints adjusted, and commercial goodwill strengthened.
Mail publicity is now effectively used to create and retain business or to
establish new processes or ideals. In fact, many great establishments
conduct business entirely by mail order.
The ability to write a good letter embodying the use of the English
language in a simple, accurate and graceful manner, and so expressed as
to create a favorable impression and secure the desired result, is one of
the most important and essential accomplishments which anyone in business
can possess.

Advertising Practitioners- of many years’ experience, and of standing and
reputation. It is practical, simple, clear and concise. It explains advertising

in both the agency and advertising managerial fields. The demand for
trained and efficient advertising men and women is always there. The
remuneration is on a high scale. Enquiry about this new H. & It. course
commits you to no expenditure.
Effective English & Personal Development.
Good English, either written or spoken, is a personal attribute which can
be acquired. It is a valuable accomplishment, making possible two qualities
most useful in all our dealings with and Tactfulness.
Effective expression is a decided asset. It aids the Executive, Salesman,
Advertiser, the Correspondent, the Lady Secretary, and is a necessary
attribute to those in responsible positions. There are few leaders who
cannot express themselves well. If you want to be a leader, the H. & R.
English Course will help you quickly and pleasantly to one of the essential
qualifications, an understanding of the proper use of our mother 4ongue.

"round and is based on soundest English and Australian practice. It is offered as a positive means by which ambitious
