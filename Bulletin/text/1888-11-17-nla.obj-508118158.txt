The Cheap Imported Miner and the London
Syndicate.
We are frequently told that trades-unionfim
is on Its trial, that the workman’s combina-
tion to keep up the price of his labour has
proved a wicked and iniquitous effort to
wrong society and to rob the poor capitalist
of his Sunday beer. All the world over, the
workman has been standing up for his rights,
and in many instances he has secured such
substantial victories that hard-headed men
of the world of commerce foresee the day
when Capital will no h nger rule the destinies
of nation?. In a vain and spasmodic attempt
to inflect and modify somewhat the result of
Labour’s triumphs, the subsidised press has
been set in motion and syndicated greed has
engaged in a laborious struggle to convince
the world that it is trembling on the edge of
a commercial catacljsm which will shake
society to its very centre. In New
South Wales the miners have entered
the lists with the mine owners, and
these latter, feeling their position very in-
secure, have commenced ti deal out threats
of a bumptious and dictatorial character
which, knowing as we do the democratic
temper of the Australian people, could not
be carried into practice without deluging the
country ia blood and convulsing s 'ciety in
the throes of a terrible internecine war.

At a recent meeting in London of the
Scottish and Australian Coal Mining Corr.-
puiy—which company, by the way, owns the
Lambton colliery in New South Wales—the
chairman of the board of directors announced
that trade had so greatly increased during
the second half of the year that he felt
justified in recommending a dividend ac the
rate of 15 per cent. The chairman then
proceeded to allude to the Newcastle
(N.S. W.) strike, and stated that the wages
paid to the miners were very high, that the
men r ought to gain the mastery over the
colliery owners, and that as a consequence
trade in Newcastle was wasting away. He
hoped that it won,ld not he necessary for die
company to import miners to tvorl. the Lamb-
ton colliery , but unless arrangements were
made for an immediate resumption of void
the company would certainly import men as
they were determined not to allow the miners’
union to have the mastery in the matter. It
is Interesting to note that the remarks if
the Chairman of the Scottish and Australian
Coal-Mining Company were loudly cheered
and that the report and balance-sheet were
adopted.
* * *
The historic Plug,son, the manufacturer,
in the immortal address to his workmen, is
made by Carlyle to say : “ Noble spinners !
we have gained a hundred thousand pounds,
which is mine ; the three-and-sixpence daily
teas yours. Adieu, drink my health with
this groat each, which I give you over and
above.” The Chairman of the Board of
Directors of the Scottish and Australian
Coal Mining Company not only withholds
the groat ; he grumbles at the men by whose
labour he is enabled to declare 15 per cent.
He do as more than grumble ; he threatens
to displace them by deported “black-leg”
muscle, and his threats are “ cheere d ” by
his brother spoilers. Just at present, too,
by the financial manipulation of the
Semitic Goschbn, British bonds are bear-
ing only 2h per cent. Waggonloads of
money can be boirowed throughout the
length and breadth of the United Kingdom
at 3 per cent. The Scottish and Australian
Coal Mining Company has declared a divi-
dend of 15 per cent.,"five times the normal
rate of interest on safe investments, and
coal-shares have hitherto been as safe as the
Bank of England. Had the company de-
clared a dividend of 50 per cent, the outcry
against dear labour would have baen the
same, for is not the workman in the eyes of
the British capi'a’ist even as a weed ?
• * *
Cheap labour is the quicksand which
swallows up national prosperity. Cheap
labour is the parent of thrife, and thrife
should be unknown in a prosperous com-
munity. Prudence, finely /emarks the poet
Blake, is an ugly and ancient spinster, but
very rich withal, courted by Incapacity.
Blake might have added that she dwells
only in the land where Free Competition is
a feverous frenzy and Want stalks at neon-
day. Cheap labour means natioi al damna-
tion. Cheap labour is cheap living and
emaciated workmen, struggling tradesmen,
paralj sei enterprise, a sordid press, a de-
graded people, starvation, misery, and whito-
waistcoati fencing in some dozen or so s’ave-
holders who batten on the universal woe.
Where wages are high and wealth widely
distributed, morality and independence are
the watchwords of Progress, money rapidly
changes hands, stomachs are full and the
people happy. Nobody saves because Want
is afar off; nobody starves because muscle
cm be readily coined into food and clothes,
or the equivalent of feed and clothes. Cheap
labour in Australia means England and the
horrors of England transported to this
southern land Introduce cheap labour, or
allow it to be introduced, workmen ! ar.d
you import all these hideous social con-
ditions which drove you from the country of
your birth—social conditions to escape from
which you courted voluntary exile and en-
dured the miseries of an expatriation that at
the time must have wrung your hearts almost
in twain.
• * •
Workmen of New South Wales ! you must
stand in this matter shoulder to shoulder !
The Government will not help you. When,
but recently, you sought to maintain the
price of your labour, the representative sys-
tem that rules through your sufferance and
by your votes endeavoured to bring you to
subjection with the assistance of military
coercion—swords were unsheathed ; work-
men who were pledged as volunteers to
defend their adopted country were insulted
by being deprived of their ammunition ;
armed police patrolled j our streets ; inoffen-
sive citizens were arrested, and the ordinary
forms of justice were perverted to obtain
their punishment for acta which the evidence
failed to show they had committed ; the
Press attempted to direct public opinion
against jou ; Nordenfeldt guns and iifl.es
loaded with ball-cartridge were brandished
in your faces, and the Premier of your
country went out of his way to prejudice
your case by the publication of hyper-judicial
opinion ; you were goaded into rebellion,
but nobly refused to rebel. Workmen, the
Government will not help you ! You stand
alone, but you must stand firm. The im-
ported “blackleg” must never put his foot on
Australian soil ! Never !
* * *
Only a few weeks ago the Judges of the
N.S. W. Supreme Court were set at nought by
Sir Henry Parkes ; the whole British nai ii n
was defied, and the Governor of New South
Wales was threatened with deportation.
Why 1 Because the Government of the
moment sought popular favour by excluding
the Chinaman. To day a worse thing is
threatened, and the Government stand, and
will stand, supinely by. Only the other
night the New South Wales Premier, in
pathetic tones, depicted the sorrows of the
interesting “blackleg." The infirm wife and
the decrepit family were trotted out to point
a moral and adorn a tale. In your interests ?
No ! In the interests of the sweater, the
breath cf whose nostrils is cheap labour.
The battle of the toiler, so hardly fought, so
dearly won, for your wivts, for your chil-
dren, for generations yet unborn, is to be
relinquished, to be irretrievably lost, because
there are men too selfish to see any
interests but the interests of the in-
dividual. The man who cuts down the
price of his labour, hurts not himself alone,
not alone the infirm wife so frequently
dragged into the sickly prominence of parlia-
mentary debate, or the decrepit family to
which is given an unhealthy oratorical pub-
licity. He harts his fellows—all the work-
men in the country. He injures the small
and struggling tradesman. He wounds the
community in its most vital part. He in-
flects the prosperity cf the nation and draws
a post obit on futurity. The prosperity of
any country, says Frederic Harrison,
never rises higher than the prosperity of its
working-class. The working-class is, after
all, the real people. Those who do no work
live on the labour of those who do work,
and they can, therefore, be easily dispensed
with. The country In which the life of the
workman is not worth living, is a country
not worth living in.

In the days of the past, when Parkes
was seeking vo L es and voices, that wily
political acrcbae i 'i rased the popular clamour
of the time against the importation of con-
victs. He put himself at the head of an
angry democratic agita'ijn and dared the
Government of the day to land any fresh
cargoes of Britain’s sentenced sin. The
attempt, he said, wouli be fol'owtd by a
rising which would sweep the bread-arrow-
branded victims of England s criminal
code into the sea. Yet, tj-day, were
the threat of the Scottish and Australian
Coal-Mining Company to seek practical ex-
position, this old-time rebsl and ex-Ohartist
would brandish a fire-look in jour faces
and dare you to resent it, But you must
resent it, nevertheless The future of this
country depends upon you, and you must do
your duty, for io is your duty. Ttie men
who have undertaken to frame for you a
future, to give you laws, to fashion to your
use a system of society, have imported, with
all their hideous anomalies and heartless con-
tradictions, all their injustice and century-
built-up wrong, the modes and manners, the
faiths and fashions which to-day are making
of the old world a hell upon earth. To
escape from them you have come here.
Here you have formed the nucleus of a
nation ; here you have built a home. Keep
that nation vigorous ; keep your home pure
and clean !
* * #
Let England take care of her own paupers !
Why should we offer her a solution, even
though it be but a temporary one, of her
social problem !■ We have our own troubles
to look after, cur own streets to sweep.
America has long been used as the rubbisn-
heap of Europe, until America has become
almost a second Europe. One such experi-
ment ought to bo enough for so small a world
as curs. Let us learn by other people’s
experience, else had it been better we were
born blind. America, too late, is a vakenit. g.
She is legi lating against theE iropcm dead-
beat as she recently legislated against the
Chinese dead beat. Let us profit by her
example but with the additional advantage
of doing a day before the fair what she is
doing a day after the funeral ! We shall
never gei such another chance ! England
must bo taught that she has no right to shoot
her rubbiih on this continent. Too long
have we received her moral failures ; now
we are threatened with her financial and
industrial wrecks. Labour we can take
plenty of : the land is hungering for human
muscle; but we will take it on our own terms
and in our own fashion, in our own good
time. To make fat dividends for London
syndicates we refuse to allow our people to
become the bond-slaves of capitalised greed.
* * #
What is a fair day’s wage ?—As much as
ever a man can get. No, says Capital, as
little as he can live upon in such a style as
will enable him to make ua profit without
leaving him anything over. If the workman
is satisfied with ss. a day, beat him down to
2s. 6J. If 2s. 61. is enough, so is 2s. If he
will work for bread, try him with garbage.
If he can live (n air, pay him with kicks to
keep him from getting fat and to make him
spry. All the world over, wages tend to the
bare subsistence point—and below it. All
the world over, the capitalist demands as
much profit as he can wring out of sweating
toil. In dull times the percentage must be
kept up just as in prosperous times. How
can it be done ? Easily ! —cut down wages ;
reduce production; make the workman eat
less and the consumer pay more. What is a
fair percentage of profit f Two-and-a half,
says Tory Goschbn. Fifteen per cent.,
says the chairman of the board of directors
of the Scottish and Australian Coal-Mining
Company ; 50 per cent, if you can get it.
Two hundred billion per cent., if the Lord
is willing, bellows the capitalised dollar-
hunter throughout the eternal ages.
* * *
The trades-union has made the lot of the
wprktnan endurable. It is the arm inter-
posed between the descending lash and the
trembling slave. It has grown and blos-
somed into a gigantic institution which bids
fair to overshadow the earth. Its future is
big with the workman’s fate. It must, how-
ever, gradually change its functions until
from a combination of workmen against the
tyranny of Capital it becomes a combination
of capitalist - workmen who will employ
fhrinsrlrex on the basis of co-operation. In
Australia, in New South Wales, at Lambton,
it has at present one stern duty to perform.
If the Scottish and Australian Coal Mining
Co. should carry its threat into execution
and deport to these shores the “black-leg”
labour of starving England, not one of those
miners must be permitted to land— not one.
To accomplish this it is hardly likely force
will ever be required. Moral suasion and
political organisation will be all sufficient.
If force should be necessary the Government
of New South Wales must look to it. They
have sown the wind ; they must be ready to
accept the whirlwind. But it is hardly likely
that the workingmen of these colonies will
be so blind to their own interest as to allow
the thing to grow to a practical attempt at the
realisation of such a dastard threat. How-
ever that may be, Australian workmen have
historic precedent to go upon—precedent
furnished by Sir Henry Parkes, poet and
ex-Chartist, against convicts, against Chinese,
though not against a greater enemy to the
community—the “blackleg.” But precedent
or no precedent, the threat cf the 15-per
cent, coal-grubbers of London will never be
carried out ! We would not allow it ; the
miners would not allow it; the combined
workmen of New South Wales would not
allow it; Australian democracy would Trot
allow it !
Blake, alias “Magralh."
Dear Bulletin, Tub appointment to the Go-
vernorship of Queensland of a man who earned his
promotion by doing the dirty work of the British
Government in Ireland does not seem to please
any party in Bananaland. The Irish, of
course, have a warm welcome in store for “ Mr.
Terence Mag rath . ” who has contrived to amuse
English readers and promote his own interests by
drawing his “Pictures from Ireland ” in black and
whide, with a preference for the black. They also
remember that when the emerald isle was divided
into districts, by the late lamented Buckshot, for
the purposes of coercion, Mr. Henry Blake, one of
the Divisional magistrates with autocratic powers,
shewed that the Venom which tipped the point of
many an anecdote of Terence Magkath was no
passing quality. On the contrary, that, with the
sunshine of Government favour, id had ripened
and matured into the correct thing in tyranny.
As for the “loyal” inhabitants of Queensland —
we must take the word “ loyal ” in its comparative
meaning when speaking of them —they are pretty
much dhgusted that the tradition of the diplo-
matic service v>as been broken, and that a man is
being foisted upon them for having taken a
prominent par j in the gutter politics of
the mother-in-law o.untry. They think that
their colony is of sufficient importance to be
treated to a Governor who has had some training
for the billet, or that at least it is as worthy of one
with some pretensions to respectability. Instead
of that they find themselvis and their £5OOO a year
(widh pickings) thrown as pay to a broken-down
understrapper from Dublin Castle. Hence their
tears.
* * *
But perhaps the most prominent position of all
is that assumed by the born and bred Banana-man
towards his new “boss.” It has come to his
knowledge that Blake is an Irish policeman, and
as he is strongly of opinion that Queensland has
already a toa-generous supply of the ‘ Foorce,”
his disgust at the appointment is as unstinted
as the vocabulary in which he expresses it. 11 hi s
words could only be translated into action, and
the action bottled up until Terence made his bow
in Brisbane, it is highly probable that His Excel-
lency (save the mark!) would be very glad to return
forthwith to his modest billet (£1500) in Ireland
with the congenial occupation of evicting the low
peasantry and burning their filthy homes. How-
ever, even with a liberal discount, it is certain
that there is still enough “unpleasant’ feeling
among all sorts in that condemned Northern
colony to make it very warm for Saynyer-
Constable Blake when he arrives. And
this is quite as it should be. No doubt tire
Colonial Office thought they were giving
MTlweatth a pretty hard smack in the face by
sending him Terence Mageath for Governor in
return for the disagreeable hunks of humble pie
he made them swallow lately. If so they have
not learned yet how not to do it so far as “ ouah
kawlonies ” are concerned. Blake is just the man
all Australian Nationalists would like to see re-
presenting British Imperialism in their midst. He
is a very fungus growth of Imperialism and sprang
up suddenly during a time of popular misery
and despair in an out-of the-way, dark, and
noiseme spot called Dublin Castle. The off-spring
of an old but degraded family he sought to nourish
his fortunes by doing work for the Castle at which
t ie stomach of many an honest constable rebelled.
There are men in Australia now, worrying
through life and experiencing to the fullest how
hard is the struggle for existence, because they
refused to act towards their kindred with the
loathsome cruelty which Blake’s party adopted
and for which England is now giving him his re-
ward. If there is a spark of manhood or a ray (f
reason in the wretched “colonies,” they will chafe
and fume at having to be the price for which the
vilest Imperial abominations are done. — Anti-
Coercion.
Rajah Inglis, the New South Wales Minister of
Public Instruction, has conceived another great
and glorious idea. It has always been understood
that the male teachers of his department are
forbidden to take an active part in any business
outside of their ordinary avocation. The tiger-
slayer has evidently gone one better still, however,
for some good-natured friend recently brought
under his notice the awful fact that the wife of a
certain public-school teacher up North was engaged
in the capacity of book-canvasser, and the lady
promptly received an intimation to the effect that
she must not engage in any business that could be
regarded as competiting with other persons in the
district as long as her husband was in the service
of the Department. This is a highly prudent
precedent, of course, for the woman who would
canvass for books to-day might canvass for
Indian tea to-morrow ; but the difficulty will be
to decide what comes under the head of competi-,
tion. The public school teacher’s wife who puts a
new ceiling to her husband’s pants may be said to
enter into competition with the local tailor ; if she
makes up her own dresses, she competes with the
local milliner ; if she raises “chookies,” she runs
against the interests of the poulterer and grocer;
and if she should be fortunate enough to add
triplets to the population she may be severely cen-
sured by the canny Minister for unduly competing
with other ladies who may be anxious to secure
Her Majesty’s liberal £3 trophy. Mr. Inglis’
ukase against a married woman earning anything
to light 1 1!! the burden of the poor pedagogue, her
husband, looks like a cheap electioneering dodge
to catch the votes of the bourgeoisie. And it is
an insolent and pig headed contravention of the
modern principle that a married woman is entitled
to a separate estate. The school-teachers of New
South Wales will get level with Inglis and Go. at
next general election.

The Senate of Sydney University expended £5OO,
interest on the Fisher bequest, on books for
various departments of their library last week.
Chemistry got £BO, medicine £BO, physics £BO,
natural history £BO, literature £BO, and mental
philosophy and logic (together), £l5. And yet
people wonder how it is that batter ways of
governing men are not adopted in New South
Wales! The human mind must ba understood
before it can be wisely ruled. If we feed a inan
according to the above scale and put him on the
Bench we defy him to trust to any other formula
of amelioration than the rope and thong.

The Lesson of the Presidential Election.
Grover Cleveland had two planks in his
platform but he wisely, as it turned out, only
showed one at a time. The first was official purity
and that floated him into office—the second was
Free-trade and that cost him his re-election to the
presidency of the United States. The American
people are heartily sick of official corruption and
are prepared to go great lengths to get rid of it,
but they are not prepared to sacrifice the com-
mercial system upon which the prosperity of their
country is built for the sake of it. On the con-
trary, the official “steal” which disgraces the
American political system, is indeed it does
our own, is a nuisance the Americans submit
to as the price of their power over the whole
bureaucracy. Every corrupt official knows that
he plunders the country with a rope round his
neck and that the next political change may not
only displace him but call him to a severe account.
When Gkoveh Cleveland pinned himself to the
abolition of official corruption he became for the
time the most popular politician in the United
States, and though the Democratic party which
he headed was the weaker, he went in with flying
colours. When he announced himself resolved
upon a revision of the tariff he settled his own
business for ever. The American view of his
programme may be summed up in the nursery
rhyme which says
It's better to have crumbs for the mice to steal
Than to have no crumbs at all.
But for her tariff, American industry, which even
now has all she can do to absorb the flood of cheap
labour which debouches upon her shores from
Ireland, England, Germany, Sweden, and Den-
mark, would be swept out of existence. As it is
tire average wages of the American artisan are
nearly twice those of his British competitor. The
skilled English mechanic averages 31s, per week
wages if he can get a job—which greatly depends
upon his moral character, i.e., whether he attends
the same Little Bethel that is patronised by his
boss. The American mechanic averages ■Ms, (»d.
per week in New York and 50s (id. in Chicago,
and no one cares the odd (id. what his moral
character may be. Taking all the industries of the
country into consideration, male adult labour's
average earnings in America are 28s. per week,
and in England male adult labour has to be satis-
lied with an average of less than half the sum, or
12s. (id. per week. It is not, therefore, wonderful
that GboveS Cleveland lost his election. The
Americans have a surplus .revenue of 28
millions. Grover Cleveland would have had
them divide it between the English and the
Germans in (he shape of a remission of
Customs duties 5 Harrison will counsel them to
keep it at home and divide it among their own
people by remitting internal taxes. The victory
of Cleveland would have meant the revival of
British trade and the downfall of American
industry. The victory of Harrison means that
American men will be able to earn food for their
families and that England must look after her-
self. That is the lesson of the Presidential
election, and that is the reason why our Freetrade
orators hold their tongues about it. Had Cleve-
land been re-elected we should have had oceans
of eloquence poured upon us to convince us that
“ the creature Protection’,’ was defeated in her
stronghold. As it is, all our Freetrade orators
could do would be to convince us that Freetrade
and official corruption are proved in New South
Wales to be quite as compatible with eacli other
as Protection and official corruption have shown
themselves to be in America, and that is a lesson
which, for obvious reasons, they do not care to
inculcate.

“ Protestantism First."
November sth and the preservation of that
British Constitution—which has for so many ages
slowly broadened down from precedent to prece-
dent—from the only skyward influence that ever
offered to give it a hoist in the direction of heaven —
are always seized upon by the yellow pup of a trans-
ported Boyne for a super-sonorous snarl. Gun-
powder treason and Orange gas seem to be cor-
relative. The one generates the other, and this
year no doubt on account of the impending
drought and the increasing deficit —the snarl was
a double-barrelled one. The Rev. W. S. Fbackel-
ton spr c ad himself on the recent occasion, and won-
dered why Mr. Dal ley was not righteous even as
he, Frackelton, was righteous, and then he swung
round to remark that he intended to tell the
wicked, worldly Government of New South Wales
—which, by the way, the L.O.L. is never abso-
lutely sure of having on sectarian toast-that
“ once and for all they would vote for Protestant-
ism first.” Good, Frackleton, and so say we,
but you don’t mean what you say, and we do.
“Protestantism first! ” What does it mean?—
Sectarian bigotry, century-lived hate and all uu-
chaiitableness, low, calculating, Christless cunning,
political knavery, underground engineering and
caucus dodgery, distrust of one’s fellows, lies,
misrepresentation, and all the evil that hangs like
a huge tin-can from the tail of that pitiful yellow
pup wl io yelps and snarls and howls in an “h”-
less dialect at the heels of progress and cannot even
bark grammatically ! Is this Protestantism ? _ It
may be, according to the man of quarantine-
advocacy, the Frackelton of Australasian in-
tolerance —not according to that first of free-
thinkers and free-fighters who loved woman and
wine and song and took a foremost place in front
of the front rank of the advance army of
thought, and laid about him sturdily in
the cause of progress and reason. Old
Luther was the Tyndall, the Spencer, the Max
Nordau, the Darwin, the wholesale iconoclast of
his day. He destroyed what he considered to be
shams, and rehabilitate d on its throne that Reason
of man's which bad been 100 many centuries de-
posed by Faith. With Luther, Protestantism
meant being ahead of your period—a hundred
years ahead. With Frackelton, Protestantism
means lagging in ttm rtai t 30 a- period—a
hundred years a-rear. “O aid!’ shouted Luther,
“ look towards the dawn !” “Backvaid !” screams
Frackelton, “thesun has set, look behind you !”
“ Toe Truth ! the Truth !” cry all the brave Pro-
testants of Science and Progress, “ no matter how
revolting or soul-searing it may be, let us have
only the Truth.” “Remember Boyne !” shriek
the renegade advocnes of what they are pleased
to term Protestantism, “ and to Hell with the
Pope!’’
The New Vicc-Kegal Policeman.
The Colonial Office in London has risen in its
dignity to resent the demand made by Premier
MTi.wraith for a share in the appointment of the
new Governor, of (Queensland. The dignity of a
British “ department ” is a huge and awful thing,
and the departmental dignity has been damaged.
The feelings of the Secretary have also been hurt
and his moral corns have been trodden upon.
The appointment of Sir Henry-Blake is the
response of the Imperial Government to the
reasonable demand put forward by a democratic
community that it should have some voice in the
selection of an officer who is paid out of the
national treasury to be a shining stumbling-block
in the path of national progress, and the question
to be decided is whether Queensland will accept
this dull mediocre Tory as the ideal leader of the
young nation of the North. The past record of
Governor Blake stamps him as a fifth-rate failure
of the deepest dye, and his promotion seems to be
intended merely as a declaration in practical form
that the Secretary of State for the colonies “ will
do as he darned well likes.” In his earli°r days
Blake was a boss policeman in the bogs of bis
native land, where he attended to the business cf
running down his brother Irishmen when they
wanted to have a band in the management of their
own affairs. From this position he rose through
the exertions of his brother in-law, who happens
to be a duke, to the office of police-magistrate,
and for some years he sat on the bench and sent
the sons of the soil to gaol when they assumed a
menacing attitude on account of the rint. Then
the duke gave him another shunt, and he assumed
the Governorship of the Bahamas. He super-
intended the affairs of these scattered rocks in a
manner which brought the public anathema down
on his head, and he retired from his next billet—
in Newfoundland —with the derision of that land
of fogs and cod-fish piled on top of the other
malediction. From first to last, in fact, the
record of Governor Blake shows him to be an
unduly elevated policeman who, if left to rely
solely on his own merits, would speedily drift
back into the “cop ” from which he sprung, and
his instincts are still those of the ordinary or
garden constable who drifts round to the back-
door in pursuit of pie. His appointment to the
Governorship of the colony which leads the way
towards republicanism and independence, and
which promises to be the first to shake off British
influence and dispense with Governors for all
time, is a joke of such stupendous dimensions
that it requires consideration. If Queensland
is—as the British Tory fondly hopes —to be re-
tained even for a little time longer as an integral
portion of the empire, its future Governors must
be men of brilliant genius who can tack between
conflicting parties and steer a steady course
through every storm ; the occasion is one which
demands a statesman of the highest order, and
the Colonial Office fills the gap with a glorified
policeman. The first result of this policy has
been to compel a practical fusion between the
opposing factions in the Queensland Assembly.
Lord KnutsFord's despatch, in which he main-
tains the old Tory doctrine that the people of
the colonies must lie low and accept any kind of
Governor which it pleases Providence to inflict
upon them, was considered by a council of two
composed of MTlwraith and Griffith, and the
reply, in which the Queensland Government ex-
pressed its indignation at the appointment of the
gilt and varnished constable to the vice regal
office, was drawn up jointly by the two leaders of
popular sentiment in the northern colony. Sir
Samuel Griffith’s action means the practical
abolition of the decaying party of “loyalty”
as a poli'ical power in the North, and if
Governor Blake ever actually assumes office he
will be a lonely satrap abandoned by all save
that occasional flunkey whom we have always
with us. The feebleness of the instruments with
which the battle of Imperialism is being fought in
Queensland is a solemn commentary on the in-
tellectual capacity and resources of the men who
use them to support the cause of British Toryism.
Musgrave and Wright- the costly pair of broken
reeds who staked their dignity on a question of
salary in advance and a problem concerning two
pairs of boots—were alike miserable failures, and
Governor Blake— the decorated “slop” who is
related to a duke —has failed before the ink on his
commission had time to dry. With him, however,
political ruin is evidently chronic. A man whose
temperament is such as to call down upon him the
curse of even the peaceful Bahamas, stands a fair
chance of being received with violence when he
endeavours to stem the fiery current of Queensland
democracy.

Tlic Toymakcr on Ills Brother Aiti/.ans.
“Search the annals of the world in ancient and
modern times in Europe or America and you will
never find a people so well off that a large body cf
them can refuse 10s. a day of eight hours labour ;
but that is what has happened in this country.”
These are wise words from the lips of a renegade
representative of the masses in the New South
Wales Parliament. And then he goes on not
satisfied with having opened his case with a false-
hood —he goes on to execrate the white slave at
Newcastle or elsewhere, who, combined with his
brothers, should ever dare to hope for a better
state of things than he has read of, forsooth, in
“ancient or modern times 1” Coming from the
pale-faced, kid-gloved descendant of ages of so-
called “Noble Ancestors,” we of this New South
World might possibly find .time to ridicule such
statements. Emanating from the lips of a man
whose only excuse for being in the Parliament of
his country is that he was put there by the
labourers and artizans thereof, the utterance
quoted is far beyond the sublimest realms of
sarcasm.

A Very Civil Servant
No wonder Treasurer Burns hesitated to lay
upon the table of the New South Wales Assembly
the papers on “ Crown Lauds, Hornsby,” which
were reluctantly dragged out of him on Thursday,
for a perusal of those documents shows that Minis-
terial wrong-doing has had the effect of actually
blinding the servants of the Crown to the dif-
ference between right and wrong. The earlier re-
ports from Messrs. J. W. Peering and Gordon
simply describe that which has often before been
described, namely, the improvemmt made on the
estate of Messrs, Burns, Withers, and Smith,
M.sP., at the public expense, by utilising the
labour of the unemployed in grubbing and clear-
ing roads through the lands owned by those
gentlemen. Mr. W. C. Bennett, however, is not
satisfied merely to describe the process whereby
the thing was worked. He boldly attempts to
justify it. He says:
Had this land been reserved Crown lands not to be sold,
all the roads would have been desirable .... And I
fail to see why the possession of the property by private
individuals should be a bar to necessary improvements
because they incidentally enhance its value.
Bravo, Bennett ! You fail to see why public
money should not be used to improve private
property. You fail to see why the owners of
private property should be left to do it themselves.
You fail to see that if these roads “enhance the
value” of “the property of private individuals,”
as they assuredly do, that private individuals
would have made them for themselves if there bad
not been obsequious Government servants to
remember that these private individuals were
public men, members of Parliament, Ministers
and future Ministers—persons worth toadying.
You have arrived at the right point of
official blindness, dear sir, and have
proved yourself so far invaluable. But the
mistake you have made is in openly writing
down a description of what you have failed to see.
That is the foolish part of the business. To be
blind is a valuable qualification for office, pro-
vided you say nothing about it, but swear all the
time that you see clearly. Had you said, for in-
stance, that the road a quarter of a mile off, which
did belong to Government and did give access to
the Grown lands, and was sufficient for its pur-
pose, and was bartered away by the Government
to those same “private individuals” for permis-
sion to expend public funds on the improvement
of tfceir property-had you said that this road a
quarter of a mile off was too distant for the
delicate people who buy unimproved Crown lands
to travel, you would have been invaluable.

The Leasing of the N.S.W. Tramways.
At no very distant datej the heterogeneous collec-
tion of pawnbrokers, rum-sellers, and chronic in-
solvents who assemble in Macquarie - street,
Sydney, to curse and throttle each other, may be
called upon to decide whether the snorting,
double-decked, bloodthirsty street railways of
Sydney shall pass from the possession of the
people into that of the White Waistcoat party.
This affair [threatens to mark the initiation in
New South Wales of the great struggle against
Monopoly, which may eventually lead to
the reconstruction of the “ social fabric.”
Once let the system take root in Australia
and soon its monstrous growth will over-run the
whole continent; the railways and telegraphs, the
telephones, tramways, and places of public amuse-
ment will slide from the feeble grasp of the
People into the capacious maw of capitalists who
will coalesce to raise freights and fares and thus
build palaces and hang their women with dia-
monds on money wrung from the pockets of the
stupid and unthinking people who only work.
What is to prevent at the present juncture a syn-
dicate, which is wealthy and daring enough to
purchase the cumbrous juggernauts that poison
the atmosphere of Sydney, from endeavouring to
bias the votes of the men who are to decide
the question, at so much per vote ? Of course we
are aware that the Government is composed of
men who have repeatedly proved the purity of their
motives and the unselfishness of their principles.
We would hardly care to assert that if the neces-
sity for a second Judas should arise he would be
found in the ranks of the New South Wales
Legislative Assembly, for we have had evi-
dences in the past that no member of Parlia-
ment would ever take a bribe—though he might
unthinkingly accept a present at a time which,
being honest and truthful at heart, he would be
ready to subsequently admit was suspicious and
ill-chosen. The tramways of Sydney, under the
existing system, are as ugly and inconvenient as
they can well be; but still they are the property
of the people, and a Government which has shown
its incapacity to create and sustain a system, ex-
cept as an eyesore, and at a dead loss to an im-
poverished exchequer, has no right therefore to
pawn the property of the people or make it a
source of emolument to a horde of rapacious
monopolists. This is a subject of vital import-
ance to the people of New South Wales and of
Australia, and it will decide whether Monopoly, the
born foe to all liberty, social and political, is to ob-
tain a foothold in a land already groaning be-
neath the weight of abuses, introduced coevally
witn the bond-slave system of assigned convict
servants.
The Clergy on <iiaiiil>ling.
At a somewhat incongruous gathering of repre-
sentatives of piety and politics, held at Melbourne
recently, resolutions were passed deprecating the
prevalence of gambling, and the Government
was urged to refuse postal and telegraphic
facilities for betting purposes, while the authorities
were also asked to make the publication of all
betting transactions a misdemeanour. The Bul-
letin opines that after such an emphatic expres-
sion of opinion from the assembled worth of Vic-
toria, that papers like the S. M. Herald and the
Argus will consider it their duty to suspend the
publication of reports of race-meetings, betting-
market quotations, &c. Of course, when we say
that we believe they will do this, we are writing
in a fine vein of sarcasm, well knowing
that, with these papers, when it really comes to
a tug-of-war between the God of Bethel and the
God of Mammon, the last-named is a “dead bird ”
everytime. At the gathering to which we have
referred the Rev. W. H. Fitch Err editor, by the
way, of the Melbourne Daily Tblegrath— might
have been heard Cassandra-like “prognosticating
woe” on the colonials because of their wicked
partiality for having their “little bit” on “a sure
thing,” and we are told that he quoted a number
of statistics proving the immense disproportion
of the racing provision and racecourses as compared
with the population of the colony. This we admit.
When we remember that there are some hundreds
of racing clubs in these colonies; that each of
them holds two or more races in a year, and that
some of them race almost once a month ; that
scarce a week passes that some new course is not
opened; that nearly every barber’s shop has its
totalizator; that almost every tobacconist lays the
odds; that some of the largest streets in our
large cities are filled with Chinese gambling
shops where fan-tan and opium-smoking hold un-
checked sway; that in Sydney big professional
pedestrian gatherings are held nearly every week ;
that almost every other man you know keeps a
psd. in training chained up in his back yard, just
as one would keep a bull-pup; that go where
you will you meet the same class of young men
of the professional pedestrian-cam-larrikin type
with the same curly brimmed hats, the same cut-
away coats, the same tight pants, the same boots
with heels right under the instep, and, worst of all,
with the same depraved minds—dwelling ex-
clusively on the one absorbing subject of gamb-
ling — when we consider all these things, we
wonder how it is four-fifths of our population
manage to keep out of gaol.
Judges or Partisans?
The demoralising character of the New South
Wales criminal code is clearly shown by its in-
fluence on many of the dignitaries who are its ad-
ministrators. These individuals seem to be in-
capable of maintaining a calm, judicial aspect
when human lives are at stake or a decision deal-
ing with the conflicting interests of the monopolist
and producer is required. After the Crown had
removed some of the alleged Northumberland
rioters for trial toMaitland, which (rial was delayed
by every possible means, while bail was altogether
refused, the failure to secure a conviction so
annoyed the presiding judge, Mr, W. J. Foster,
that, abandoning all semblance of his judicial de-
meanour, he declared, with all the appearance of
a partisan, that, in order to secure convictions in
future, it would be necessary to change the venue
to Sydney . At Deniliquin, recently. Judge Win-
deyer insulted a jury tor failing to return a
verdict in accordance with his desires. Some days
later, at Wagga Wagga, the same uncouth func-
tionary, while sentencing the Union shearers, had
the bad taste to compliment the jury on thsir
decision, which, he said, was in marked contrast to
that of the Deniliquinites whose conduct was
most reprehensible Now if the system of trial by
jury bs considered as a safeguard against despot-
ism, a vehicle for the expression of public opinion,
and one of the bulwarks of democracy, it is surely
necessary that jurors should be defended from the
insults of politically-appointed officials, who,
armed with a power they are personally ill-quali
fied to wield, with instincts which too often seem
to be wholly on the side of the dominant class,
assume in court utterly unjudicial attitudes. Such
conduct not only dims the calm serenity of atmos-
phere encircling the bench, but is likely to defeat
the purpose of trial by jury through the coercion
of pliant jurors by biassed arbitrators.
Tlic VMiilecliapei Murders.
Had the victims of the Whitechapel murders
belonged to the superior classes the whole
resources of England would have been pledged
to avenge them. As it is, as they belonged to
that great army of starvation which seeks in daily
infamy the means of daily bread, the Home
Office is tranquilly passive and the Treasury is
quietly inaccessible. The city police authorities
are aroused and the people of the metropolis
are indignant; but Government, always Con-
servative in administration, no matter who may
be in office, sees no reason for action. Yet
in the bare fact that such lives are possible
lies an indictment which should make the official
world tremble and affright the superior people
officialism represents. For these outcast women
who have been slaughtered in the purlieus of a
city cf palaces are not the only sacrifices to
London’s greatness. Her growth is manured
with the blood of the wretched, and the roots of
her prosperity are mulched with crushed
humanity. Officialism tries to trample misery
out of sight, and wealth devotes to the attempt to
hide it much of the means which should be used
for its alleviation. There is a conspiracy to keep
it invisible which few travellers penetrate and
many residents never suspect. Guarded gates
and portly beadles shut it from the squares,
and the police, with a continual “ move
on,” chevy it from the highways, and
well-paid sentries beat it back when it
attempts to excite sympathy and implore assis-
tance. When you, the Australian visitor to Lon-
don, turn into one of Spiers and Pond’s big Lon-
don restaurants, do you ever guess why those
gigantic servants stand in livery at the door ?
They are to prevent the famine-struck beggar from
beseeching your well-fed Lordship to give him a
penny when you contemplate reviving yourself
with a meal; to drive him off when lie trios to
peer through the plateglass at your plenty, lest
his. wolfish eyes and famished face should spoil
your appetite and limit your expenditure. Do
you know why lofty gates enclose tire squares
and streets and terraces that call the Duke of
Bedford owner; that belong to the famous
Sir Henry Doughty Tich borne, to Lord
Portman or the Duke of Portland? It it so
keep the sores of L i/.ARUS from the sight of Dives
that those gates arise. Did you ever wonder why
the sturdy policeman breaks his stately gait now
and then to dodge and dash after the rat-like
ragamuffins that scuffle and scuttle away down
byways and back lanes at his approach ? It is to
keep them oat of sight, that’s all : to drive them
to such a distance that their rags shall not come
between the wind and your noblity. There are
a quarter of a million of paupers in London in whom
the official dole barely keeps the breath of life
alive. There are 300,000 people out of work in
London who never know where their next meal
will come from, nor where they will lay their
heads at night. There are two millions of men,
women, and children in London whose utmost)
struggles barely buy them food enough to keep
them on that border line which separates a life
of continual starvation from death by famine out-
right. Upon this great substructure of misery
are founded the fortunes of Freetrade commerce and
unprotected manufactures engineered by sweaters ;
and from beneath this substructure is squeezed
the human refuse upon which the Whitechapel
murderer or murderers have played their ferocious
tricks. These were not gilded Traviatas, splen
did in velvet and shining with jewels. No 1 The
last poor, murdered wretch was identified by the
pawn-ticket of her protector’s undershirt found
upon her person. He, poor brute, had pawned
his boots to buy the last meal they hid shared
together, and she bad sallied out to ee c k in sin
the means for their next repast In sin ! Who c
is the sin ? Is it the sin of poverty clutching at
existence, or of wealth living by the premedi-
tated creation of misery ? As the Faubourg
St. Germain emptied Itself upon Versailles
to, some day, will Horrible London empty
itself upon the West End Then, when
fair women find scant mercy, and gentle
heads are bowed in blood, some daughter of the
people will speak in the vengeful spirit of Therkse
Defarge “We have seen these things done to
our women, we mothers and wives and sisters of
the poor, and no one heeded our misery. Why
should not your women suffer, and why should we
heed your downfall ? What is your wretchedness
more than ours ?”
The S. M. Herald defends a statement made in ;
one of its late leading articles by saying that “the
same thing has been said hundreds of times
before.” Without looking up the statement, the.
defence may be taken as thoroughly honest. Un-
less a sentiment or opinion had run the gauntlet
of hundreds of forms of publicity it would be
looked on as too revolutionary for approved‘ser-
vice in the Herald’s leading columns. In fact,
the first thing that paper would have felt bound
to do with anything not a hundred times ac-
credited would be, if it had to touch it at all, to
condemn it as a doctrine fraught with incalculable
danger to society. But, all the same, it strikes
the average healthy mind that it is unfair to offer
it in a pretentious leading article a thing “ which
has been said hundreds of times before.”

them to the fact that toilers in other lands besides that of
their birth are suffering under cruel injustices. So pur-
blind in this regard is the ordinary Irishman that in the
British Parliament the Home Rule party have repeatedly
voted against measures introduced for the benefit of the
toilers in England. Precisely the same thing has occurred
in N.S. W ; men have actually come hot from meetin ga where
large sums were subscribed to assist the Irish Land League
for the purpose of speaking against local measures em-
bodying the very principles the League is struggling for.
Michael Davitt seems to be almost the only eminent
Irishman who is sufficiently cosmopolitan to recognise
that the Irish Land Question affects the whole civilised
world. Church rule and centuries of oppression have
somewhat narrowed the Irish mental horizon ; with hap-
pier days they will assuredly lose that insular and racial
political selfishness which is their most deplorable charac-
teristic. That their intelligent leaders, journalists and

The Referee
Four times in the last five years has the
Melbourne Cup winner previously finished first or
second for the Stakes. Three times out of those
four a couple of horses placed in the Saturday’s
race have also been placed in the Cup, the Stakes
runner-up pulling off the big event on each occa-
sion. As a further coincidence, we find Dunlop
and Mentor successively carrying the same
weight, under similar conditions, in their respec-
tive years. And we also find that the Melbourne
Suoetsman —a journal peculiarly fatal to wretched
backers—went out of its way to show the “ unre-
liability of all Melbourne Stakes form.” The
“sporting” Mokanna who perpetrated this per-
version of real facts subsequently selected six
horses out of the 12 that stood any paper-show of
winning the Cup. Not one of the Prophet’s half-
dozen struggled into either of the first four places!
There are not many more genuine sports-
men in Australia than Mr. T. L. West, the “ up-
country ” owner of Tradition. In preference to
making the dark ’un a “ dead bird ” for a sequence
MISS ADELAIDE DETCHON.
of minor handicaps, Mr. West pluckily went out-
right for the two biggest events of the year.
After the Caulfield Cup he —although a compara-
tively poor man—declined several offers for his
horse. He stuck to his own method of training,
and himself gave Tradition an occasional breather.
Finally, Mr. West wouldn’t have his champion
spurred home, not even for a Melbourne Cup, and
Tradition came back to scale without a scratch on
him. But when a good old-fashioned horse is run
in good old-fashioned style it is described now a-
days as a “ sensational animal.” (N.B.—Tradition
was sold by auction on Monday last and realised
3050 guineas.)
* * *
Many of the “best” Melbourne ladies
avoided the Cup for fear of an unholy push, but
the whole sex—both sexes, in fact—conspired to
bring off the most successful Oaks Day ever
enjoyed by the V.R.C. The attendance was
nearly up to average Derby form, for there were,
say, 20,000 people on the ground. But as the
Government House party consisted entirely of
men, who stuck strictly to business, sassiety did
not do the Lawn with much ardour. Neither was
the great Exhibition Cup Day—newspaper reports
notwithstanding— at all remarkable in this respect.
The Lawn was at no time thronged, nor were the
bulk of the promenaders skilfully dressed. To
sum up the show, it was more remarkable for
quantity than quality.
• • *
Twenty-eight horses ran for the Melbourne
Cup, and the books, at starting prices, could
get round ”by laying eleven of them. It is only
fair to state, however, that most of the seventeen
possible “ skinners ” had no chance of winning
except through a visitation of Heaven.
The public generally had a pretty fair time
at Flemington on Oaks day and the “ cracks ” for
the time being ran well up to form. That Carbine
could canter away from the boss Maribyrnong Plate
horses in the Flying Stakes only goes to prove »he
two-year-olds’ lack of eicellence, because former
years have produced youngsters equal to lowering
such performers as Cranbrook or Malua, when
Mr. Inglis’s horse was at his best. A faint aroma
of greatness always hangs about the Oaks, yet
there was little real interest attaching to this
year’s race, apart from its title. Pearlshell had
beaten Volley over the same distance on two
previous occasions recently. She looked equal to
doing it again. O’Brien rode the New Zealand
mars as though he had a soft thing and she ran
up to expectations. As regards the Mentor-Cy-
clops dead-heat for the Royal Park Stakes there
is no question that Mr. Cook’s horse had the Cup
winner settled at the finish, a result which was
strictly according to calendar. Mentor was giving
away eight pounds more than in the Cup, and,
furthermore, he was giving Cyclops a long start.
The one-eyed gentleman slipped his field when
they were going at half speed, and the effort of
catching and passing the leader so told on Mentor
that he dropped off a little at the critical moifient
when Cyclops was experiencing a second coming.
In estimating the form of these two tough oppo-
nents it should he remembered that Mentor is only
a big little horse, to whom a few pounds of Weight
over nine stone would make more difference than
to Cyclops.

The FJemington meeting finished up in a
blaze of glory on Saturday. Backers opened pro-
ceedings with a misguided plunge on the showy
South Australian horse, Aldivalloch, tor the
Maiden Plate, but from that timte forward the
men who followed form Were mostly happy. Car-
bine won his rafte in a style that made the Derby
running look Very wrong Savanak squeaked
home ih the Flemington Stakes because he got the
best of an outrageously bad start. The Steeple
was a fiasco in favour of favourite Flashlight, and
Bravo won the V.R.C, Handicap on his merits.
Nothing was going better for the Cup at
1| mile, and here Bravo met his old opponents on
many pounds better terms. The pretentions of
Whakawai to be other than a flashy flyer were
crushed in this event. They allowed the gay de-
ceiver to gdlop away after his training-track
custom, and he did gallop beautifully until the
pinch came, after which Whakawai whacked
away no more. Mentor added more lustre to The
Bulletin’s Cup tip by beating Cyclops and the
Peer over three miles, yet there was such a sneak-
ing prejudice against Mr. Wallace’s deep-chested
hero that the books never tired of laying 2 to 1.
Mentor has fairly proved himself the best horse
in Australia for the time being, but as regards
his easy defeat of Australian Peer it will be well
to remember that Mr. Gannon’s horse was trained
too light for a long journey ; also that he seemed
tender on his front toes. Although looking as
handsome as might be, the Peer was not the mus-
cular animal seen at Randwick. The Free Handi-
cap—or getting-it-all-back stakes—was a real soft
thing for The Queen, and every man from N.S.W.
had got it very, very straight. Here endeth the
great Exhibition-Cup Carnival.

every winner throughout the year will start (in

to be the improvement of the bree'd ot hordes, but
it is difficult to se’e how this desirable end is to be
attained by the indiscriminate production of geld-
ings. Had Ensign been a colt his broken leg
could have been set, and he would have had a
chance of making a name at the stud. The aboli

Dear Bulletin, —In re your par as to

already know it, that a good percentage of the
Australian “yidden” can use their “mauleys”
'i he winner of the Queensland amateur middle-
weight championship, Mr. L H. Nathan, who
weighs only nine stone, is a Jew. He is not only
a good boxer, but a capital all-round man, well-
known in the athletic world. A clever profes-
sional lightweight, who has fought several good
battles in Sydney and Melbourre (although nob
calling himself Aaron) is, like Jack Thou p on,
one of the persuasion. I could name two cr tbrte
more lights of the fistic arena who should sign
themselves, as does yours, &c, “A Jew,”
Brisbane. Aprop>os of this we are reminded that
Mr. Keesing, a Hebrew, is the champion amateur
heavy-weight of Auckland, N.Z.

got to the and that the frequency with
which ha ye led out “Europe!” when near the
lighthouse caused the lightkeeper to think he was
in doubt as to his whereabouts, and to vouchsafe in
stentorian voice, the information, “No, this is
Horsetraiiyer!’’ At last, in response to his agonised
appeals, he was landed, and went to Melbourne
by train. Another amateur Viking held, ’tis said,
put in somewhere down the coast, and solemnly
swore off “ yotting ” there and then. In a thir d
case the amateur crew, after a bad attack of mal
de-mer, deserted almost en masse.

On December 1, Messrs. Seale and Sandai),
w SpeC j iv ?T amateur boxing champions of
N.S W, and N.Z. , are matched to meet in an
eight-round encounter at Eoley’s Hall, Sydney.
Sandall has improved vastly since he first showed
in Sydney, but in tackling Mr. Seale he is meet-
ing a phenomenal boxer who has never been
bested for science, although pitted against the best
talent available in Sydney, amateur or pro*
fessional. Tighe, Steve O Donnell, Eogarty, and
New Zealander Pettengall, have been clean
knocked out in public by the amateur, and
in scientific displays with Jack Hall, Peter
Newton, Tom Lees, Costello, and Jack Burke, he
would have been awarded the palm had the de-
cision gone on points. Sandall can “take his

can get home, but the writer has an idea that he
will be outclassed by the Sydney champion.

Y.M.O.A. Hall —Miss Adelaide Detchon „
The cool, sequestered shade of an awful
emptiness spreads its leaves _ over the Sydney
theatres. For weeks past this disease has been
growing like the liver in the spring, or like the
premonitory symptoms of that internal disaster
which prevents the young man of the present day
from feeling well, and it is growing still. When it
began Sydney was filled with shows of a joyous
and mirthful description, and now that they
have mostly gone to seed it keeps on just the
same. On Saturday night Rignold and Allison
rose to combat this prevailing woe by putting
"The Rajah ” on the stage at Her Majesty s, but
after one night of gaudy prosperity the audience
began to stay away almost as much as ever, and the
only satisfaction that remains for the management
is that the public aren’t there to an even greater
degree at the rival houses and nobody seems
to know where they have gone to. "The
Rajah ” is a pale, brownish-green spot in the midst
of this desert of adversity. It is not distinctly a
comedy, for the only comic incident in it is an
untatural fat boy who is always eating and who
carries nourishment in his hat; and it does not
fill the bill as a drama, for there is only one
dramatic scene in the whole four acts, when a
large, slow man with property gets a son of toil
down on the ground and mauls him and drags
him about and tries to tear his shirt off. The
Rajah, who gives his name to the proceedings, is a
behind-hand sort of person with a pale-green
umbrella, who moves his reluctant limbs as if each
of them was an abandoned lead mine filled with
water, and drags his weary frame around after the
fashion of a sinking ship loaded with pig-iron.
He is the chief cause of the drama, and he gives
rise to it solely because he makes half an observa-
tion at long intervals, and then breaks down from
sheer exhaustion and tries to think the rest, but
tails off into vacancy while still endeavouring to
clutch the thinking process, and leaves the final
end of his inspiration in ruins, thus giving occasion
for misunderstandings. He is too tired to mention
why he spoke, and he falls asleep while striving
to remember why he is making an effort to think ;
and he carries his head far back, partly that it
may rest on his shoulders and thus relieve him of
part of its weight, and partly in the hope that he
may one day see painted in the air in letters .a
foot long some coherent observation which will ex-
plain to him why he is there. This character is
tilled with a good deal of success by George
Rignold, who drifts through his part with an air
which suggests that he was started by some ex-
ternal force and had found it an awful bore, but
had never since been altogether able to stop him-
self so much as he would like. He also suggests
that he was born leaning against a tree, and
stayed there till the tree wore out, and then went
and leaned against the next one. A more attrac-
tive feature is the charming Miss Kate Bishop as a
lovely, joyous, wilful, insurrectionary maiden,
who lives in a state of chronic warfare with the
Rajah, and longs to throw something at his head,
but is restrained by the conviction that she would
die of old age before he awoke to the consciousness
of the concussion. Another insurgent girl is kept
alive by Miss Roland Watts-Phillips, and Messrs.
Greville and Tolano are required to make mirth
where mirth is not as an individual of the Stiggins
order and a sketchy person whose indefinite out-
line has been embezzling money. Mr. Jewett has
a mean little part, and has all he can do to avoid
losing his shirt, and Mr. Sweeney is a badly-
painted fat boy with a stupendous bun. The
"Colliers’ Strike” was evidently run in as an
alternative title to make the audience believe that
the drama is about something, and some of the
best scenery yet produced in a theatre where the
paint is always provided with a lavish hand im-
presses the public with an idea that the events
happened somewhere, or, anyway, that if they
didn’t happen the management was careful to pro-
vide a place where they could have happened if
they had wanted to.
** * *
“ Uncle Tom’s Cabin ” is again the pre-
vailing affliction at Sydney Royal, and we are
called upon to weep as before over the belaboured
African who hadn’t sufficient go in him to hit
back. The humble psalm-singer and amen-snorter
who appealed to our feelings in the days when we
were boys together is trotted across the stage of
public grief once more, and his harrowed carcase
casts its shadow over the valley of the Red River
as it did in 1860 and upwards. An attempt has
been made by expanding the part of Topsy and
making her turn somersaults and sass her pro-
prietor in public, to lend an unnaturally comic
element to the tragedy, but the effort falls
flat, for all the time we suffer from an
awful impression that somebody is bashing
Uncle Tom behind the scenes, or that he is
tied up to something and languishing in cap-
tivity. After a while this fear expands into a
morbid craving to see Uncle Tom bashed, and we
want Eva to hurry up and die so that the assault
and battery may re-commence. Even Topsy gets
wearisome at last, for her presence appears to
make people reticent about hitting Thomas with
the large piece of leather which they carry about
for the purpose, and Maggie Knight’s fine acting
in the small part of Eliza seems like an intrusion,
and we rise to ask why, if she is not going to
pound the much-walloped slave herself, shedoesn t
clear out and make room for someone else who is
prepared to keep that persecuted person in a
proper state of martyrdom. Yet when the piece
is ended we faintly realise that the over-worked
and underfed Baptist wasn’t whaled so very much
after all, and then we feel that we have been
swindled. Uncle Tom always lw »* * s if he had
just been admonished with the end of a hard rope
weighing at least 801bs., and as if he was just
going away to be admonished again, but this len t
the reality that the public crave for, and it doesn t
fill the bill any more than the sight of an overfed
man can fill the place of a dinner. One hundred
and eighty-seven other objections are held over.
The cast at the Royal shows that a large amount
of talent has been recklessly thrown away, a
few items in the general waste being Game
Swain herself, Maggie Knight-whose brilliance
is lost upon a frozen river—Messrs. Carey, orde,
and O. Harris. A lot of scenery, which would
have made excellent table* clothe, is also expended
on this disappointing drama. In our private
capacity, we regard the entire show as a publica-
tion which ought to be tied to a truck at a goods
station where a drunken official is superintending
the shunting, and allowed to take its chance, and
if the chance proved to be a bad one we would
celebrate the occasion by going out to drink the
health of anarchy and eternal smash.
Mr. Foley, of the White Horse Hotel and
the Gaiety Theatre, Sydney, also retired cham-
pion boxer of Australia, and various other things,
has become the owner of a daughter. The smile
which pervaded his face during the last few days
gave rise to an impression that he had won a
£500,000 sweep, but this rumour was unfounded,
Mr. Foley’s joy being based entirely on the cir-
cumstance above-mentioned.

The Melbourne shows wallowed in such a
slough of prosperity all last week that managers
generally decided to remain in the middle of it
for a while longer. Under these Carnival circum
stances nothing in particular happened on Satur-
day except at St, George’s Hall, where the usual
company did something rather fresh in either of
three trifles, more or less new. An inconsequen-
tial delirium, described as “Patchwork,” consti-
tuted the main body of an entertainment which
appeared to afford great satisfaction to a crowded
house. The latter portion of this eulogium is bor-
rowed from the daily press of Australia, the
United Kingdom, and several other countries
under the British Flag.

A further continuation of “Mikado,” at
the Princess’s, has dealt a cruel death-blow to
The Bulletin's childlike faith in Messrs. Wil-
liamson, Garner, and Musgrove, and a rumour
that this distinguished firm doesn’t properly un-
derstand the nature of an oath is gradually gain-
ing ground. Only the other day, W., G. and M.
were inviting particular attention to their comic-
opera time-table, setting forth a sequence of pre-
arrangements from which nothing might, could,
would, or should induce these gentlemen to
swerve. They gallantly stuck to their protesta-
tions for three solid weeks, but when ‘' Mikado
had completed its allotted span, the Serpent
tempted them, and they fell with the historical
dull thud. Instead of putting up “Mascotte,
they held on to a sure thing. They burst up their
unalterable plans for the sake of money (mere
dross), and that conscience-torturing time-table is
already an obsolete publication. Barring bloated
business, there is little about this latest perform-
ance of “Mikado” calculated to atone for the
Triumvirate’s breach of promise. Miss I anny
Liddiard distinctly fails to be funny as Katisha,
and Mr. Leumane can’t rub in the necessary local
colours. Also, the Japanese potentate gives one
the idea that he ought to swop his sceptre for a
quiet pub. But Miss Nellie and other originals
are about as good as they were before, and the
prevailing effect is quite too altogether.

“ Carmen " lingered peacefully on at the
Opera House until Tuesday, but “The Bohemian
Girl” was to suffer a further resurrection last
(Wednesday) night. After Friday, however, that
venerable charmer will return to the oblivion she
is best adapted to adorn, and Mr. Simonsen pro-
mises “II Guarany ” for the first time in these
parts. At the Royal there is still a steady demand
for “Hands Across the Sea,” and the Alexandra
finds customers for “The World Against Her.
This drama wrestles violently with the question
“Is Marriage a Failure?” but a six-act contest
terminates in a draw, as usual.

“Sophia” holds on tight at the Bijou
until Saturday, when the Brough-Boucicault
talent purpose paralysing their adherents with
“The Squire,” best of all Pinero’s serious comedies.
It is worth mentioning that this particular
“ squire ” is quite a different type of creature to
Squire Western. This one wears a bustle. Wirth s
Circus continues to gallop round the arena amidst
shouts of horse approval, and the Federal Minstrels
have a nice time at the Hibernian Hall. Like-
wise Frank Clark’s crowd are still getting there
or thereabouts at the Victoria. But those tuneful
Jodellers from the Jungfrau leave Melbourne
almost immediately, with their wild ocarinas slung
behind them. They will take a second innings in
Sydney ere returning to the snow-clad peaks of
their own beloved home.

Since The Bulletin hurled a series of
honest curses at vice-regal command nights
those miserable pomps and vanities have tempor-

character, or else that observant emblem ot
monarchy has given his lessees and managers to
understand that he preferred taking a show just

all. Anyhow, Melbourne theatrical advts. have
been purged of the nauseous headlines for many a

ject in life is to catch the vice-regal eye. Three
representatives of Victoria Regina were on hand

lb was merry Christmas time at a certain

The convalescent hospital to be erected on
the shores of the Parramatta River— to provide
which the late Thomas Walker bequeathed a sum
of £lOO,OOO— will shortly be an accomplished tact.
The buildings are to consist of 10 cottages facing
the river, with out-buildings, lawn-tennis courts,
bowling-green, and quarters for medical otticers,
matron, and staff of attendants, dining-rooms,
bath-rooms, library, concert-room, and other ac-
commodation, and the total cost is estimated at
£30,000, leaving £70,000 as an endowment for the
institution. Mr. Walker had long contemplated
the foundation of a convalescent hospital, put it
was postponed through pressure of other business
and he died leaving his idea for others to y
into execution. The following clause in his
bequeathed his benevolent design to his heirs :
For a considerable time past I have had it
to establish in part of my land here (Yaralla) a hospital
a somewhat extensive scale for the receptiOTi and
tion to health of convalescent patients from the hospita,
of Sydney and elsewhere. But the pressure of other
claims on my time has prevented me from r Y th
project into effect. Should this still be the state of the
case at the time of my death, then I hereby enjoin the
trustees of my will and my daughter to
design as soon after my decease as it hereby
to do so. With a view to enable them to do this,lhereb>
direct my trustees to appropriate and set asideout of y
estate not less than £lOO,OOO, for I assume that this sum
may be sufficient lor the building and maintenance of t
hospital I have in view to establish.
The hospital on the Parramatta River will be
Thomas Walker’s best monument.
Dear Bulletin, —King Kalakaua, of the
Sandwich Islands, means to visit Melbourne Ex-
hibition. Some vears ago I had the Pleasure of
a trip on a Pacific mail steamer from Sydney to
’Frisco, having on board a small but singularly
well-assorted complement of passengers, which
included, besides the usual collection of gushing
widows, ardent youths, staid married c ° u Pl®®«
and the inevitable baronet, a world-famous astro-
nomer, whose unfortunate contretemps with i ve-
rnier Parkes over his Sunday lectures will never he
forgotten as an example of Chnsti
ana who, under the able conduct of the ? nuc „ .
travelled ” Smythe, had just cleaned Victoria and
N.S. Wales out of their spare cash and so de-
pleted the pockets of all N.Z. that the colony has
never been able to attain a financial equilibrium
since, a well-known Australian actor who will
easily be recognised under the name of the
“genial George,” and a young Englishman, a
cousin of the inventor of the hoary-headed tor-
pedo. These three with the writer made up a
quartette, who, after the labour of the day (eating
and sleeping, mitigated by whist and nap ) was
over, were accustomed to while away the midnigh
hours in the saloon under the then liberal rule of
the P.M. Co., which left a light burning all
night. At Honolulu the passenger-list was
increased by the addition of his Majesty
King Kalakaua, and suite, and a very sweet
suite of American adventurers they were, too.
The state-cabin on the upper deck, made famous
by having been occupied by General Grant on ms
trip round the world,’’ was occupied by
Nibs ” and the adjoining cabin by his suite,. the
district being immediately christened Cannibal
Square” by the irreverent. Kalakaua himself
was a very decent fellow—for a king—not at all
of the same kidney as the Thakombaus and others
of the South Sea Island genus, whose most
striking exploits on their visits to Sydney have
not appeared and never will appear in print, while
the Obscene Publications law holds sway. He
was then a tall, handsome, portly gentleman,
speaking French, German, and English, in which
latter language his accent and mtonationwere
equal to that of most cultivated Englishmen or
Americans, and quiet, modest and unassuming in
spite of the efforts of his suite to make the com-
mon (white) mortals on board “kotow to him.
“ His Nibs ” soon heard of the enjoyable evenings
(and early mornings) passed by the all star
and three-star company, and although desirous
to become a member it was not until the night
before our arrival in ’Frisco that he was able to
escape the vigilance of his attendants and join the
festivities of the four. A pleasing sight it was to
see His Majesty at the head of the sa’Loon table,
carefully keeping within reach a bottle of fine old
Bourbon, beaming on the gang and taking
his turn in merry yarn and lightsome jest,
while his ame damiUe, nicknamed Count
Robert,” hovered like a restless ghost in
the background, vainly endeavouring to get
the monarch to bed, to which destination His
Nibs ” steadfastly declined to proceed-as long as
there was any whisky left in the bottle. But the
climax of the fun was reached when the astrono-
mer-now, alas, no more '.-looking at his Majesty
with a round-eyed and innocent expression ot in-
genuous inquiry which all who have seen him can
readily imagine, asked, in the words of Artemus
Ward “Well, how do you like being a king as far
as you’ve got?” His Majesty did not know at
first whether to order Mr. Proctor off to execution
or to laugh .; his aide-de-camp nearly fainted with
horror ; but his Majesty took the milder course
and cachinnated, finally replying that he thought,
on the whole, that being a king was the most
desirable line of business going (he has changed
his mind since). The seance rose at 4 a.m.-b.b.

They clapped a screw- jack under Milton
(N.Z.) Presbyterian Church the other day, boosted
the sanctuary on a lorry, and wheeled it away to a
new site. Immediately the sacred edifice was off
the ground the meenester and two elders flopped
on hands and knees to fossick where the founda-
tion-block had been for the coins usually deposited
in such places. The meenester, with professional
dexterity, was the first to strike colour. With a
yell of holy triumph he grabbed the coins. The
pom, rather. “ Hechsirs !” he said, with a rather
elongated smile, but with an anticipatory smack
pf his lips, ‘ 1 ’tis but the price of a wee drapp—
that is, brathran, it’s joost a saxpence.” Then,
while the elders sat back on their heels and blas-
phemed in Gaelic, he added, “ May the deil tak
him that poot it there —it’s bad ! ’ The TlaFkka
Times, in recording these sacred incidents, or
some of them, pokes unregenerate borak at
the impecuniosity of the Miltonian faithful
when that church was built, suggesting that
they were hard up for generosity or money.
The son of Caledonia stern and wild who grinds
outiihe Bruce Herald, in reply, with chilling
gravity gets upon his hind legs to declare,
that “The Tuafbka Times ia quite mistaken.
Money was more plentiful then than now, but
the church was built by a thrifty race, who
did not believe in depositing their money
where it would yield no return.” There is a cold-
blooded level-headedness in this declaration
worthy of a pawky and
pious Scot. We painfully
icise to suggest that the
devout should, on future
similar occasions, pub a
largeish cheque under the
foundation stone. A
cheque payable, say, to
Angel Gabriel—to his
order.

When the man who
writes this was a young
reporter he used to be
sent round to morgues,
and police-courts, and
sermons, and tea-meet-
ings and other cheerful
places, and when he went,
as he often had to do, to
godly bun-shivoos, he was
much embarrassed by the
warmth of the welcome
extended to him as a
“brother in the Loard ”
by clerical authorities
who, unaware that he
had come on a merely
business visit, extended
to him that vice-like grip
of fellowship with which
the clergy always greet a
new customer. It seemed
hideously ungracious to
turn round, after being
received with so much
crnpresseimnt and say ;
“ Excuse me, reverend
sir. hut I am not a Hard-
shell, as you seem to
think; ” but on the other
hand the mere idea of
pretending to be piously
interested in the proceed-
ings suggested the basest
form of hypocrisy. But
the poor scribe very soon
discovered a remedy—ha
found that the formula of
the elders of the journalistic profession on such
occasions was, “Ah ! good evening, sir ; I repre-
sent the Morning Snoozer.” That always
froze them right off at once. When they got to
know you were a pressman they never expected
you to believe in anything—even in themselves.
They invariably accepted you as a fellow-humbug.

that the style of matrimony in vogue is a heap of

The New Zealand Offenders’ Probation
Act is not always the unmixed blessing
it is cracked up to be. Too frequently it is
utilised as a medium for tempering with mercy
the administration of justice to the “well-con-
nected ” criminal. A previous clean sheet and a
friend or two with a little influence are certain
passports to the good-will of the Probation Officer.
A case illustra< ing the operation of the Act re-
cently came to light at Christchurch. One Bag-
nall, a well-connected thief, had received three
months for larceny, but was discharged on proba-
tion. The very day that he got his probation
license brought him another slice of luck, in the
shape of £4OO remittance from “home.” He
thereupon, instead of sitting down in sackcloth
and ashes, and going in for repentance and lachry-
mosity, incontinently went on the spree, and in a
week spent £fio amongst people who were no
better than they ought to have been. The Proba-
tion Officer now thinks that his clemency in Mr.
Bagnall’s case was ill-timed, and has “had him
up,” with a view to obtaining an order that he
shall serve out his original sentence.

On earth she was so prim

She fell with little ruth.
Was fond of advocating
A gown for naked truth ;
She passed severest strictures
On drink, and dress, and dance,
And held as crimes the pictures
Displayed by wicked France ;
She thought a marble statue
Too vile for epithets,
Worse than the photos, that you
May find on cigarettes.

Ajar, and with a grin

And bows, and she is in.

THE HANGMAN’S LAMENT.
189.
Oh, for the good old times, when human life
Was sacrificed to Art ; my hangmin’s skill
Is useless now ; false sentiment is rife !
And Justice e’en attempts to cure, nob kill.
They called my gallows a vile thing and tore
It down from where it held its place on high'.
They little recked that my old heart was sore,
And deep emotion dimmed my aching eye.
For them it was mere beam and rope ; for me
Far higher, holier, an altar great)
Of fierce avenging Justice, and to be
The very ground and bulwark of the State.
’Twas more to me, for ’twas the scene on which
I proved my art, and stood without a peer;;
Eor who so well could tie the fatal hitch
And place it lovingly behind the ear.
’Twas the high altar—l, the chosen priest;
And now that altar bub exists in name.
Time, I have seen, works wonders ; but at least
It cannot rob me of my well-won fame.
Well I remember when I sent four boys
O’er to tbe other world before their time,
Some low and vulgar people made a noise,
And chose to call my virtuous act a crime.
Then rose the clergy, and the lawyers boo,
And all of any note within the land,
To prove that when the fatal bolt I drew
Twas God’s own Justice spurred my willing’
band.
Ah ! that was fame, to see how I was loved
And my profession lauded high by all;
Even when faults occurred, as when I shoved
A victim off who had refused to fall.
I never had to jump upon a man
To break his neck, as other hangmen did ;
A touch, and down at once the bodies ran,
And with a thud to kingdom come they slid.
Ah ! how 1 scanned the papers in those days
With eager expectation, so to learn
If rape or fiiurder done a chance blight raise
To swell my list and give niy skill a turn.
And when a trial was on I almost prayed
Eor “guilty ”to be spoken. Oft in hope
The case would help nle in the way of trade
I’ve hurried houie to choose the soap and rope.
I loved the galldws loved it heart and soul;
Bub uiost when on the rope a body swung.
Men thought it dreadful, but to me ’twas droll
, To think how easily a nian is holng.
Tis easier than hanging dc gs; their weight
Is half the job the cap is o’er the head,
The clergyman has done his little prate.
The bolt is shot, and there —the uian is dead.
Oh, for the good old days ! What is there now
Worth living for ? My art has ceased to be.
What matter now who’s slaughtered in a row
It never gives the slightest joy to hie.
My art is gone, though puppets now I swing
To cheer me up, I find an aching void :
For want of living subjects everything
Is changed since my profession was destroyed.'
Oh, for the good old days ! Alas, for me,
My soap and rope are laid upon the shelf.
One only thing remains that I can see
I’ll take them down and straightway hang—
myself.

two lay helpers, and a schoolmaster on a stipend
of £3BO a year. The schoolmaster, who, in addi-
tion to possessing all the cardinal virtues, must be
able to play the harmonium, is paid £25 per
annum—about a tenth of what a successful jockey
raises for winning one big race.

The French Baron de Bourgoing, who has
just died, used to tell the following story :
When I was a young man, I fell in love with a charming
girl I used to meet at balls and parties. I found out that
she reciprocated my sentiments, and obtained her permis-
sion to speak to her father. The next morning 1 called
on him, was shown into his study, and presented myself
as a suitor for his daughter’s hand. The old gentleman
seemed surprised at first: but when I had assured him of
the sincerity and stability of my affections, he offered no
further objections, and, accepting me as his son-in-law,
sent for his daughter. As the door opened I ran to greet
my fiancee —it was another young lady—your mother, my
child, he continued, suavely smiling at Mile, de Bourgo-
ing. I had abstractedly come to the wrong house,
pressed my suit with the wrong father, and been
given the wrong wife ; but, of course, I could not retract
or put upon the young person the indignity of refusing
her. She did not live long, he added, with great
serenity. Pray take some more wine !

An item of interest to the Smiths and

The sale of the Royal < »ak Hotel, at Knarasborough, the
other day, marks the extinction of one of the oldest, if
not the very oldest, families in England, the Swales of
Swale Hall, in Swakdale, Yorkshire Sir John S vale
who, at the age of 51, died without issue on the 24th July
last, was for many years the proprietor and landlord of a
little inn at Knarasborough. Yet an ancestor of hie-
rather remote, it is true—married a descendant of the
Lady Aethelflaed, Alfred the Great’s daughter. Alfred de
Swale was Lord Chamberlain to William the Conqueror,
and another member of the family, Magor de Swale, ac-
companied Richard Cmur da Lion to the Holy Land. Up
to the reign of Charles 1. the Swales occupied a leading
position in Yorkshire; but they suffered sorely during
the Civil Wars.
Thus, while in Hingland the old nobility descend

The following protean yarn is going the
round of the British press :
A lady and gentleman were travelling together on an
English railway. They were perfect strangers to each
other. Suddenly the gentleman said: “ Madam, I will
trouble you to look out of the window for a few minutes ;
I am going to make some changes in my wearing apparel.”
“Certainly, sir,” she replied, with politeness, rising and
turning her back upon him. In a short time he said:
“Now, madam, my change is completed, and you may
resume your seat.” When the lady turned she beheld her
male companion transformed into a dashing lady, with a
heavy veil over her face. “Now, sir, or madam, which-
ever you like,” said the lady, “ I must trouble you to look
out of the window, for I also have some changes to make
in my apparel.” “ Certainly, madam,” and the gentleman
in lady’s attire immediately complied. “Now, sir, you
may resume your seat.” To his great surprise, on resum-
ing his seat, the gentleman in female attire found his lady
companion transformed into a man. He then laughed
and said : “It appears that we are both anxious to avoid
recognition. What have you done? I have robbed a
bank.” “ And I,” said the whilom lady, as he dexterously
fettered his companion s wrists with a pair of handcuffs,
“am Detective J— —■, of Scotland Yard, and in female
apparel have shadowed you ; now,” drawing a revolver,
“ keep still.”
Mrs, Margaret Fox Kane, one of the
Sisters Fox who first introduced spiritualistic
,s lances into this breathing world, recently con-
fessed that the old “ manifestations ” were a base
deception. It makes us smile. Only last week
in Sydney we popped a mediutn-man into a black
bag, tied tightly round his neck. Then two of us
put him on a chair and sat facing him. We held
his knees and kept our feet on his feet. The gas
was turned out, after which the spirit played
banjoes, chucked the furniture about, and hit us
in the middle of the back, and when the gas was
lighted again we were discovered to be wearing
ball-toppers and nursing wind instruments. The
medium remained in the bag as before. He had
no confederates, and all the mamfestations were
his very own. But the spirit gere J’y laughed
while he thumped us with a fidd.e, «>- r,S r fore
concluded that it was another base deception.
This idea was confirmed when the voice of the
spirit crept through the gloom, saying, “ Ain’t it
a— — good show ?”

Rather a “ rekerky ” thing in the way of
weddings was successfully pulled off at Broken
Hill (N.S.W ) a little while ago. Neither bride-
groom nor bride was very intimate with the
other’s records, but as each one seemed in a
desperate hurry to make the other happy for life
they faced the parson, shouted “Lst her go,
Gallagher,” and in the twinkling of a duck’s thumb
the two became one. When the ceremony was
over the bridegroom lit his pipe, tucked his blush-
ing bride under his arm and started off for the
nuptial tent. Upon arrival there the newly-made
Benedict presented his soul’s adored to half a
dozen touzle-headed brats who were tumbling
round, and proudly exclaimed, “Them’s all by my
fust ole woman.” Nothing daunted, however, the
blushing bride replied, “ Good for you, Jim ; I for-
got to tell you I had seven myself over where I’m
staying; you better send and bring them home.”
This was done, and as the new batch of urchins
filed in their ma straightened herself up and point-
ing to them said, “Them’s all by my fust ole
man.” And as the bride banged her “baker’s
dozen” to bed she philosophically remarked “ We
live an’ learn an’ you never can tell till the
numbers are up.”

arduous duties consist chiefly in assisting to de-
molish costly viands and vintages at gratis ban-
quets and entering the show on a gold-mounted
free-pass once in a while, no one can ever again
accuse Victorians of being exacting, unless the
aforesaid satisfaction is of a vindictive character,
and arises out of the knowledge that at every ban-

84(iMacquarie-street, North, Sidney, Nov. 14, 1888.
MV DEAR MOOBABINDA,—
News comes to me from Victoria that there is sorrow in
the hearts of a Sydney married couple over there who are
both culprits, and are waiting to see which will have the
“cheek” to “forgive ” the other first. Smith (his name,
of course, isn’t Smith, but the back of that cognomen is
broad enough for everything) told his duckie that he bad
business which would detain him a fortnight and Jamberoc.
She immediately argued that as Jamberoo or Flemington
are some distance apart, she could have a peep at the his-
torical race and be back in time to kiss hubby, with a
sweetly forsaken air of utter loneliness, on his return.
You have guessed the sequence, of course. They met on
the G.S. steps.
A correspondent requests me to state that on the 31st
nit. Mr. Hubert Tanne, of Marrickville, was united to
Miss Fanny Rigney, of Bathurst (cousin to the officiating
clergyman, Rev. J. B. Boyce). The proceedings were
highly satisfactory, and the bride wore wine-coloured silk.
Sydney Liedertafel concert on the 14th, might have
been a howling success or an abysmal failure for all I
really know about it, the entertainment having been for
“ gentlemen only.” A Sydney musician who was present
assures me, with many tossings of leonine looks, that it
was a “feast, ’ I'm glad to hear it, but I haven't much
sympathy with “puff pow-wows.” Good music being rare
in Sydney, why so frequently exclude us from the se Idem-
obtainable?
A certain dignitary who has just married again has had
to pay ano’her “ lady ” -tatlO for refraining to mention to
the bride and her relatives quite a number of things con-
cerning himse’t
A v t ry queer fable is going the rounds just now about
an aristocratic importation connected in some way with
an Australian Government House, who peeped through
a hole in a partition of the ladies’ room at a swagger
Melbourne ca 16, where three ladies had retired after
dinner. When discovered he hadn't the sei se to remark
that he was merely a harmless social purist out fer exer-
cise with bis auger, but accepted the odium of his posi-
tion ; and now he writes in turn to each of the ladies
spied upon to explain that he’s so troubled about it that
he cannot sleep ! This is probably no invention, since he
has proved himself so very open-eyed.
At the recent “ pupils’ ball’’given by a very fashion-
able ard unpopular Australian dancing-master, the gay
and festive whirl was protracted far beyond midnight,
and when one guest, whose partner s tongue clove to the
roof of her mouth, wildly asked their host where he could
procure a “ reviver,” the dealer in waltz-steps haughtily
intimated that a jug of water and a glass were situated
somewhere on the premises, and constituted the only
available refreshment (!). Fancy dancing all night on a
glass of water!
Some of the tales current about Mary Ann seem almost
incredible. I heard the other day about aSj dney house,
wife engaging a girl from the Benevolent Asylum, my
dear poor Magdalene bringing her baby with her.
When she arrived and her would-be mistress showed her
her room, the said, “But where’s the cot? I always
accustom 1 aby to sleep in a cot!” The cot was promised,
and Mary Ann next took a survey of the premises, which,
being situated in the city, didn’t seem to please her. In
a few minutes she appeared before her mistress-for-the-
moment, fully attired for walking, and said, “ I'm sorry I
can’t stay with yer, inarm ; but, yer see, I’ve got so ac-
customed to the lawns at the ’Ome that yer ’avin’ no lawn
upsets me that much I couldn't stay. Good morning.”
Then she gave a sad smile and vanished, and the Sidney
housewife sat down hard on a chair, and said “ Well 1” at
intervals for 20 minntes.
I read recently that “ the Roman Catholics in Australia
and India have presented the Pope with 5,000,000 lires.” I
completely discredit this remark, because I don’t miss
■one solitary M.L.A.
My Melbourne correspondent indulges in suns welcome
gossip about the lawn show at Flemington on “ Darby ”
and Cup days. On Derby day the gowns were decidedly
monotonous, dull and sober colours carrying the vote.
■Lady Loch wore white silk, gracefully festooned with
white lace, and small white tulle bonnet: the two ether
ladies in the vice-regal party (Miss Stawell and Miss
Barley) wore green cashmere and green bonnet, and
coral-pink silk trimmed with coffee-coloured lace, respec-
tively. On Cup day the frocks were much more gorgeous.
Lady Loch wore a handsome gown of Nile-green silk,
trimmed with bands of darker green velvet and
orange-satin, white silk vest, and straw bonnet ornate
en suite. Lady Clarke wore Gobelin grey moire
and satin jupe with Directoire coat of moire.
The Hon. Misses Loch wore cream Liberty silk frocks
gathered on the shoulders, sleeves, and fronts, straw
hats ornate with ivory feathers, white gloves ; Miss
Barley wore white Liberty-silk and lace, white bat;
Airs. Benjamin (Mayoress of Melbourne) wore black moire
and jet; a daughter of Judah turned cut a stunner in a
pink and gold-shot train and bodice over a jupe cf
geraniums embossed in red velvet. At a little distance
she must have looked something like Solomon out “ with
’em all on.” Au rente, white was well patronised ; tan
boots shod everybody: the majority cf the gowns were
either made of cashmere or Liberty-silk; the most
popular styles were the “ Directoire ” and the “ Empire
hats were numerous and high, but not quite such “ flower-
pots ” in regard to their trimmings as heretofore ; bonnets
were tiny and elegant; floral parasols were decidedly in
the minority, and it was observe! that many Melbourne
and Sydney “leading lights” in “sassiety” were very
economical in regard to their frocks, wearing the same
get-up at the three race-meetings 1 That’s all about the
Cup, except that the vice-regal luncheon tables were
beautifully set with pale blue satin and carubia ribbon
down the centre, upon which were scattered white flowers,
crimson roses in shallow vases, and oloth-of-gold roses
almost covering the table, whilst a boutonniere was placed
beside the plate of every guest. The vice regal luncheon
party included Lord Carington, Lord Hastings (who, by
the way, is steward of the English Jockey Club, and
admires Flemingtonian arrangements), Mr. Burroughes,
the Hon. Rupert Carington, and “ E.W.” Miss Darley
was also present.
A Tamworth correspondent writes to tell me how that
Northern town bore up under its first illumination by
electric-light on the 9th inst. The Mayoresi performed
the ceremony of “switching on ” the light at 8 p.m. and
before undertaking her cnerous duty was presented by
the contractors with a gold bracelet set with one very fins
diamond, and a gold key with which to operate on the
switch. The proceedings appear to have been marked by
an enthusiasm bordering on hilarily, the only drawback
being that there was rather an overdose, perhaps, of
National Anthem.
Thera is little or nothing going on in Sydney just now.
The dull days have come with a rush, and the only thing
left to do is to pack up and flee to the mountains. The
Rose Show in the Governor’s Domain on the Bth and 9th
fell very flit and was a peifaot misnomer, as very few,
and even these decidedly weak specimens of the queen of
flowers, were on view. Lady Carington inaugurated the
affair and was the recipient of the customary bouquet,
the National Anthem being also sadly conspicuous in
three sharps. On the evening of the 10th her ladyship
was present at Miss Detohon’s first perfoimvnoe at the
Y.M.C. A. Then the “Judge and Jury ” Club— an institu-
tion which goes in extensively for burlesquing the pro-
ceedings of the Bench and Bar, gave a ball some evenings
ago at West’s Rooms, when the names of the guests pre-
sent read like a chapter from the Book of Numbers. Rose-
hill rac 5 s on the 9th and 10th were fairly patronised by

lovers of the sport not over the border, but as these are
not many the attendance was dispiriting ; and Balmain
regatta was merely a weariness to the flesh. As for fix-
tures in front—there aren’t any just at present, except
the inaugural performance of the Southern Amateur
Theatrical Society, which is to take place on the 19th, in-
stead of the ‘2lst inst. as I stated last week.
In the S.M H.’s “ Women's Column ” a writer, indulg-
ing in a “ retrospect of the Industries,” eays of the Aus-
tralian girl: “If her moral courage is not greater than
that of her English sister, her independent will certainly
is, and, having made up her mind to put her foot down,
it is no trifle that will make her budge,” &c. Certainly ;
one short, fleeting glance at the length of the average
Australian girl’s foot will substantiate (his statement " on
the nail,” for
The Australienne may be airy and gay,
And lovely and charming and sweet,
But she can’t go out on a windy day
Because of her long, flat feet.
And if she puts her flat foot down
(Some concession perhaps demanding)
A steam-motor, say, or a two-horse dray
Couldn’t move that understanding.
As I myself am an Australian girl, I consider myself privi-
leged to s»y things of this sort.
I have noticed lately that the average Sydney
sassiety' Mrs. Jellaby feeds the appetite for class distinc-
tions by gumming old-world titles on to Australian social
conditions whenever she possibly can. And here is the
latest evolved in connection with a recent up-country
wedding. “ The bride was the handsome daughter of
Mr. -, the popular squire of !! ”
High-toned Hibernianism from the S.M.H. “Cup”
report:—“All society, both of N.S.W. and Victoria, is
here, saving only that portion of it which has remained
at home /” You don’t really say so 1
Apropos of racing, I am sorry to hear that the popular
secretary of the Rosehill Racing Club, Mr. G. B. Rowley,
is unable to leave his room through serious indisposition.
He w«s very much missed at Rosehill on Saturday, when
one’s eye unconsciously sought for that familiar “ French
grey ” boxer, and found it not.
A correspondent covers I don’t kno w how many sheets
of paper to announce that there is woe in a far N.Z town,
and the cause of all the trouble is the usual fascinating
rink manager, a missing watch, flight, recapture, and all
the prettiest girls in tears, while their roller-skate hero
“sits in solemn silence in a dull, dark dock in a pcstileir
tial prison with a life-long lock.”
The S.M.H. is rapidly getting no better; It opened its
Cup report with the profane remark (put in turned
commas, of course, to tone it down): “It’s the
condition does it.”
A rumour is being gently whispered in “sassiety ” that
the individual who gave £2 tor Lady Garin "ton’s Norfolk
Island pot of jam has offered to do the vice-regal washing
free of charge, the honour of scrubbing the Government
House soiled linen being more than sufficient recompense
for the trouble incurred. I hear, however, that young
Snobson says that though there may possibly be some
truth in the report, the Baron is not likely to accept the
magnanimous offer, seeing that his people will be most
happy to pay a small premium for the honour of doing the
vice regal laundry work.
The Hobart Orpheus Club has, I am told, received a
wound in a very tender place. Not long agotheO.C.
assisted at an entertainment given to augment the funds
of the Wharf Club (an institution organised for the amuse-
ment, instruction, and convenience of men working on
the Hobart wharves), at the close of which two wharf-
labourers, both known as “Darkey James,” performed a
step-dance. Since then it is slmp'y tempting Providence
to enquire of an Orpheus man whether the negro brothers
James are the latest additions to the O.C. Yet their
righteous indignation is rather inconsistent because, until
quite lately, the members spent much time, troublg, and
burnt cork in copying as closely as possible the sable com-
plexions now despised.
I likewise hear that a Hobart man visiting the North
reports that a certain reverend gentleman now under
police surveillance for publicly indulging in sun-baths, is
identical with an individual who, under another reverend
alias, successfully duped the bishop, dean, and Hite of
Hobart years agone.
The following atrocious letter has just reached me:—
“Miss Sappho Smith, Sydney. Dear Madam, —I have
some genuine society views. I have discovered that when
boundary-riders and burr-cutters strike it fat at broken
Hill they don’t forget their poor relations. Some young
lady friends of mine here are delighted with some dresses
they have received from near connections, who are now
‘on velvet’ and doing the Block. I have been consulted
as to how they are to whiten their skins and have pre-
scribed soap, but put in Pears' name to take the rough off
the suggestion. One wretch in this camp told them to
boil themselves in soft soap and scda, but he doesn’t eat
his midday doughboy at our missie’s humpy now. It
would have been a graceful addition to the frocks if a few
other garments had been added. Robes-de-nuit and
calerons-de-bain would have been superfluous. Further
than that, it is now the habit to buy fowls on approval
and win prizes in Wagga before returning them as un-
suitable. There is not much to talk about until after
Cup time.—Yours affectionately, Scotty the Wri.nki.br ”
I read that Mrs. I’aran Stevens, a Murkan millionairess,
carries thousands of dollars’ worth of blazing gems done
up in a brown-paper parcel and tied with a white cotton
string. Her argument is that thieves would never sus-
pect that so shabby a looking bundle, carelessly fastened
into a shawl-strap, was worth while carrying away. Also,
that Mrs. Bradley-Martin, one of the codfish aristocracy,
carries her diamonds in a silk-covered hair-cushion that
serves as a bustle.
I see that, after a lengthy discussion, the Sydney School
of Arts Debating Club have been unable to come to a
decision on the question “Is marriage a failure ?” When
the matter does come to a division, it is to be hoped that
only those who have tried matrimony will be permitted to
vote.
The pallid dudelets of Australia will be interested to
learn that the latest fashion in male chapeaux is called
the tottle. It is low in the crown, cone shaped, with a
sharp, skimpy' brim. The colours are tans, old-gold
browns and pale brown.
A dejected svani writes to your Sappho complaining
that the lady of his choice has “ grown cold to vards him,
because he has shavei off his moustache —how can he
regain her affections?” Well, simply by' growing a
moustache. Everyone knows the cld Spanish proverb
which announces that “ A kiss without a moustache is
like bread without salt,” and his Dulcinea, like the rest of
her kfnd, probably' prefers the course of true love to run
smooth everywhere except on Edwin’s upper lip.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.

Dear Bulletin, —Beyond question lusty young
Queensland holds the field in the matter of Aus-
tralian Nationality, and intends to maintain her
pre-eminence. The latest incident of her stiuggle
with British Imperialism is, like the sabbath tales*
of our childhood, both interesting and instructive.
It is also dramatic to the borders of sensational-
ism, and if properly mounted and put on the
stage would be as good as a silver-boom to an en-
terprising management. Queensland is the proud
but modest-minded possessor of a fleet which con-
sists of a one-goat power gun-boat and a dipgj'.
The R N. hero who condescends (for a considera-
tion in money and kind) to boss this little colonial
trifle is one Wright, a gentleman with the form of
an undersized tobacco-sign, and the soul of
a Irobisher or a Nelson. He is admirably
suited for the position assigned to him by
fate, for besides the ordinary qualification of never
having seen any service, he enjoys the special
recommendation of possessing a high-toned con-
tempt for these quite too vulgar colonials who
have been so jolter-headed as to employ him.
About a year ago the “goins on,” as the late
lamented Mrs. Brown would say, of this Hadmiral
caused him to knock sparks even out of the tame-
cat government which was concentrated in the
person of S. W. Griffith. The Cymbrian Premier
thereupon conjured spirits from tbe vasty deep or
said he would if the other fellow didn't resign ;
but the lord that rules the Brisbane waters ran up
the Imperial white ensign to his mast head, and
declaring that ho took his orders, not from his
local paymasters, but from some semi-defined
branch of British bumbledom, he (metaphorically
speaking) acted very rudely with his extended
fingers and his nose towards the Premier of the
colony. Queensland then enjoyed the advan-
tage of being ruled by a “ sound constitu-
tional lawyer”—a singular person who per-
mitted the defunct Musgrave on more than
oD(‘ occasion to overrule bim in the manage-
ment of public affairs, by the simple pro-
cess of mumbling scm thing about “ preroga-
tive v and “constitution ’’ It is no wonder, then,
that the refractory Wright, R.N., tecura under
the fluttering shadow of the Imperial ensign,
scored the first and only victory of his li r e. For
twelve months longer he commanded the Queens-
land navy according to the wishes of the British
Admiralty, and loftily ignored the colony—except
on quarter-day. One short year, however,
brought important changes. Sir Samuel Walker
Griffith, K.C.M.G , and all too rest of it, was
relegated to that obscurity ho was created fo
adorn, and the affairs of Queensland were placed
in the hands of an individual who was not a
sound constitutional lawyer.” This person hap-
pened, too, to have rather strong opinions in
favour of that very vulgar thing “ Australian
nationality.” The result was speedily apparent.
All the starch was knocked cut of poor old
Musgrave, who proved, after all, to be a
mere saw-dust tyrant, and the constitutional
right of the Queensland Government to govern
Queensland was “unconstitutionally” maintained.
No wit became the turn of the tobacco-sign. Ex-
perienced salt as he is supposed to be, he did not
mark down on his chart the shallows and the flats
which wrecked the argosy of Anthony, and
vailed her high-top lower than her ribi to kiss her
burial. _ Or rather (to drop, Wegg-like, into prose)
he didn’t do his XXX best to avoid a row with
the MTlwraith. On the contrary, he seems to
have courted it—he felt blue-moulded for the
want of a beating, and accordingly he flourished
his black-thorn and trailed his coat in the
most correct mode. For this he was sus-
pended forthwith, and ordered to render up
his accounts. With scorn he refused Tbe
Premier instantly dismi sed—yes, actually dis-
missed— the hero, just as if he were a tutor or a
stable-help, and sent an officer to take charge of
the ship But Hadmiral Wright was tough, sir •
very tough, and devilish sly. He allowed that
officer to come on board; he heard him with
sufficient patience while he made his demand for
the telescope and the key of the locker, and
then, amid the roar of thunder and splendid
lime - light effects, he ran up the over-
worked Imperial ensign and c’aut the officer
under arrest!! This was heroic! It was sublime!
And so Wright was justified in picingthe quarter-
with all the majesty o' gait which the wrong
side of five-feet-one can command. The sun was
sinking. The semi-tropical glories of the gardens
on either hand were looking their very beet. The
city lay cowering before the pon guns over which
fluttered the symbol of Imperial rule P.aeewas
restored after the stonny convulsion of the day—
peace with honour. Brisbane—Queensland—aye,
all Australia was subdued now, and accepted
with bated breath and whispering humbleness the
proud dominion of the British joke. And there
he stood, the hero of it all; the man who defied
the MTlwraith ; the mighty chief who fluttered
the colonial Yolsci; he stood inhaling the balm of
the flowers ; building castles of rose-coloured
marble in far-off Spain: and ever and anon
returning to the thought of that day’s
victory, with the eoftly-murmured but proud
comment “Alone I did it” And then
two or three policemen came over the vessel’s
side and bundling Captain Wright, R.N.,
and his kit into a boat, rowed bim ashore. Sir
Thomas MTlwraith, by such proceedings, showed
a Philistines disregard for dramatic unities, as
well as a gross contempt for Constitutional law,
British Imperialism, and the cobweb lace feelings
of the aristocratic small-fry who feed so plentifully
in Australian waters. All this of course. Never-
theless be it known to all whom it may concern
that the clock of Imperial Jingoism in Australia
has been wound up for the last time, and that now
it is running down, slowly but steadily, and that
the hour which sounded the discomfiture of the
Brisbane Commander is one of the few which will
strike before the last stern shock of final doom
tells that British interference in Australian affairs
is a thing of the past.—B.

THI HAPSBURG DOUBLE IRON-FRAMED
PIANOS
Possess the following advantages :
Ist. The WIRES are of a very high quality, and
Intensely sensitive ; their vibrations, reverbe-
rated by a sounding board of special construc-
tion, are clear and bell-like, instead of the
muffled, or tinkettly, or metallic sounds so
common in cheap English or French pianos.
|«d. The action is perfect check repeater.
Brd- AU the Hapsburg Pianos are Trichord.
Mfe. They are all Seven Octaves,
fith. They have consolidated Iron Frames of great
strength, thus resisting the rapid mutations of
a humid tropical climate, and requiring tuning
only at long intervals.
6th. The Felts are Clinched on the Hammers, in-
stead of being fastened by glue, as is the case
with nearly every piano except the Hapsburg,
7th. They have Brass or Nickel-faced Rest Planks,
instead of the old-fashioned perishable style.
Bth Rust is guarded against, wherever possible,
by the substitution of bronze for other metals.
The outer cases are handsome in design, and
of durable and beautiful woods; they can be
had in Walnut, or in Walnut and Gold, or in
Ebony and Gold.

Beale Patent Washer , Wringer and Mangle.
The Beale Patent Washer may be simply de-
scribed as follows, and we ask you kindly to refer
to the illustration. The vertical tub is very care-
fully made, with fluted sides. It is stationary, only
the water and clothes being agitated by an accu-
rately shaped dolly, which is worked by a fly-wheel.
The clothes are simply dropped in, no arrangement
or packing being wanted. The special reversing
gear moves this dolly swiftly backwards and for-
wards, and a very small expenditure of strength
guffices to lash the water into a mass of foaming
suds. In the process the clothes are floated to and
fro, up and down; currents and cross-currents of
water are formed which meet and are forced through
and through the fabric, carrying away every particle
of dirt and stain. The linen being merely sus-
pended in the water, is not rubbed and scrubbed
as in hand-washing. Neither has anything to
submit to the hand-wringing process which in-
sensibly rips, tears and wears the clothes. Thus,
the most delicate fabrics cannot be torn by our
system of washing. Everyone has noticed that
their clothes seem to be as much worn by washing
as by use. This is caused by the fierce rubbing
they get upon washing-boards, or by the hands.
With the Beale Patent Washing Machines this
friction is done away with. Therefore, the clothes
will last far longer than by hand-washing, however
tareful. When the washing is done, the tub should
be wiped out, so that it be always sweet and clean.
There is no false bottom, and nothing to accumu-
late greasy sediments.

American Botantic Dispensary if the Remarkable
Cures that have been effected by their aid fail to
impress upon your mind this repeatedly proven
fact ? Thousands are using them, and all declare
that they possess all the virtues, and even more,
than claimed for them- Therefore, if you are run
down, tired, sick in body as well as in mind, do
nothing to patch up the worn-out machinery by
the aid of poisonous drugs, which are only injuring
you, but consult the Chief Physician of this reli-
able Institute and let him prescribe for you. You

Of a
COMPANY TO PURCHASE A FREEHOLD
Of about 22 ACRES in CITY OF PERTH,
And an
ESTATE of ABOUT TWO HUNDRED ACRES
In SOUTH PERTH,
Subdivided into about 800 blocks, almost
adjoining the City.
Capital—£Booo in 8000 Shares of £1 each.
2-i. on application. 2s. on allotment, and balance
not to exceed Is. per Share per month.
Trustees:

BANK OF NEW SOUTH WALES,
Solicitor :
THOMAS MARSHALL, Esq., Pitt Street.
Brokers :
G. DYSON and CO., Phoenix Chambers, 158 Pitt
Street, Sydney.
Directors will be elected at first meeting.
These two valuable properties are placed under
offer for the extremely low sum of £6750, on easy
terms. The extra capital is being raised to prepare
for contingencies, improvements to estates, or
other expenses which may arise.
It is estimated that not more than Bs. or 10s.
will need to be called up.
The 22a. of City Land will subdivide into over
5000 selling feet, with valuable water frontages,
and should readily realise £6OOO.
The Suburban Land is already subdivided into
about 800 quarter-acre blocks, and should realise,
at a low figure, £BOOO.
This estimate of £14,000 is based on present
selling price of the land, and if the property be
held for a couple of years it is estimated double
that price could be realised in subdivision.
Dyson, who has inspected them on behalf of the
proposed Company, for the sum of £6750, and are
being sold under circumstances highly favourable
to the proposed Company.
The expenses of the Company need be very
small, as Mr G. Dyson, who has had considerable
experience in disposing of land in subdivision, and
economically managing estates, will, if the Com-
pany feel disposed to accept his offer, place his
services and offices at their disposal for a nominal
sum, and a commission on profits. To show his
faith in the concern, he is prepared to take from
500 to 1000 shares, should that number be avail-
able.
The Company will be a terminating one, and no
other properties can be purchased without express
sanction of the shareholders.
The 22a. are in a good position right in the city,
and have about 15 chains frontage to the Swan
River; they are adjoining Government reserve,
and close to another reserve for public gardens. It
is about 10 minutes’ walk from the Town-hall, and
can be approached either by macadamised road or
water. Every block of land between this and the
centre of the city, with the exception of Govern-
ment reserves, which almost surround this estate,
is laid out in town lots, and not an acre can be
purchased at the price this is being offered at. As
will be seen by the official plans, very few blocks
of land available for subdivision can be purchased
in the city of Perth, and already such blocks are
being readily bought up by Melbourne and other
speculators, and it may safely be said that in a
few months blocks of land situated as this is, and
of such an area, will be eagerly sought after, but
unobtainable except at a very much higher figure.
The 800 quarter-acre blocks of land are almost
in the city, being but a few chains from the
boundary. It has been carefully inspected, and is
without doubt a valuable estate, being nearly all
elevated and overlooking the city, and the beauti-
ful waters which separate it from the city. It has
frontages to two main roads, and therefore is very
accessible. It is very advantageously sub-divided
into quarter-acre blocks, pegged out and cleared.
The Company will not therefore lose an acre of
land for streets or be put to expense in regard to
subdivision. Estimating each block, which is
66ft. frontage by 165 ft, deep, at £lO (which is a
low estimate), this estate alone would realise
£BOOO, being more than the cost of the two
properties now under offer.
The second reading of the bill as approved by
the Secretary of State for the Colonies to confer
Responsible Government on the colony has been
passed.
The railway from Perth to Albany is almost
completed. The Midland Railway is again com-
menced, and German immigrants are to settle on
land eminently suitable for vineyards, orchards,
and agriculture. The Goldfields are no myth, but
an encouraging and promising reality. The latest
goldfields are only a few days by good road from
Perth, and machinery is now being erected on the
field. Numbers of people are wending their way
daily to them, and it is anticipated that in a few
months a great rush will take place.
All money returned if required number of
Shares are not applied for.
The only expenses the Company, if formed, will
be put to are those attending the formation, which
will be very light.
Plan showing positions of both blocks will ac-
company Prospectus, and any other information
will readily be given at the office of the Brokers,

Here is a sample of the Spring poetry
published by Alfred Bennett, Esq.—the bountiful

wherein the bush yokel struggleth all the year
for the bait so artfully offered by an “enter-
Erisiog” proprietary with a keen eye for cheap
terature :—
It’s evidently all original—for have we not the

Sfcnon Mobb, an old identity of the Haj
(N.S.W.) district has just died in Melbourne
where he went with his fortune, made in the
palmy da vs. He was a wealthy man before he
was able to sign a cheque Many stories are
told of his skill in dealing. It is related, says s
contemporary, that he once called upon the wealth)
Mr. Ricketson of the Murrumbidgee and pressed
him to deal with him for an article. Being afraie
of Simon he resisted, but at length said “ Well
what do you want for the diamond ring ?” “ Vat
ever you like, ” said Moss, ‘ ‘ I gives it to you at you)
own price.” “Right,” said the buyer, determined
to offer a price so low that Simon would have tr
back out or lose money, “I’ll give you ten pound
for it.” “ Veil,” said Simon, “ I’m a man of mj
vord, Mr. Ricketzon, I zaid you should hafe it,
und by I sticks to it.” After the trade wa
over and the money paid, the buyer said, “ Now
Moss, you’ve got the money, and it don’t matter
to you ; tell me how much the ring cost you ? ”
“ Veil, I tells you, Mr. Kicketzon. mitout a vord

Dear Bulletin, —The yarn of your cor-
respondent “Melbourne,” in a recent issue, as to
the words of Rewi at the storming of Orakau, it
too absurd altogether. Your own version is th<
correct one. As you know, “for ever and eve)
and ever,” in the Maori language, is “Ake-ake-
ake.” There are only 14 letters in the Maori
alphabet, five vowels, a-e-i-o-u, eight consonants,
ha-ka-ma-na-pa-ra-ta-wa, and a double consonant,
nga. The letter gas a capital, and v’s and b art
entirely absent. If a Maori wished to say, “ Give
me some tobacco,” he would say, “Homai te
topake,” which has a very different sound from
the “old soldier’s yarn.” In my young days I
was what is called in New Zealand a Pakeha-
Maori, and lived with the natives for some con-
siderable time I was adopted into the
Ngatiporou tribe, who were ruled by a
woman named Mere Karake (Mary Claike).
Her husband Rihari (Richard) was consort only
and had no authority in the tribe. Rihari was
second in command at Orakau, and I have often
heard the s lory of its fall from his own lips. He
was very proud of his own share in the great
battle. He was a splendid specimen of the now
nearly extinct Maori wArrior. The Ngatiporou
were King natives and Hau Haus, and while with
them I had the pleasure of meeting and conversing
with Rewi (pron. Raywee). lalso on one occasion
dined with Te Kooti (pron. T’Kftwt and meaning
The Court). Rewi once gave me a long and in-
teresting account of the storming of Rangiripi,
in which pah he held a cjmihand.—TßOTTKß

is agreed to. After a little while he is advised to
come down to lmpatient at the
del »y and sorely in need of cash to appease his
banker he consents to the sacrifice and the broker

But occasionally the scheme falls through. One
of the growers on whom the fraud was attempted
happened to be in town the other day. and, to
satisfy himself that he was being fairly dealt with,
looked up his wool just as it was bung put up for
sale. He (givinar another name) bought the
whole of it in at per lb. A foitnight later
he received from his station among other corres-
pondence a communication announcing that his
wool had beea disposed of at Bd. per lb and enclos

confronted the broker, who. finding that he was
bailed up, excused himself by throwing the whole
blame on his clerk. If you cannot float a bogus

Ncrmantcn arid its viciriity is d nice place for a ipan to

with t.he knowledge that no inquiry .will beheld to dis-
turb the repose pf his remains,, Some time ago a boy
died, or was killed, in lha main, street, and he was
promptly rushed into the grave,and no questions asked.
Then a man died in the bush a mile or two from the town,
and, was partly eaten by diogoas. This fact saved a lot qf
trouble, for. as there was only abiut three feet of him
left, it wasn’t necessary to dig a grave of any sizs. Next
the Sub-collentor of Customs fell eft something, or else
was shoved oft, and perished comfortably It wasn't, any-

Dear Bulletin, — Ibis npt so gay a spree
as yoq might imagine to be a pastoral lessee in
N.S.W. these days. There was a time, I believe,
when the squatter owned the run standing in his
name, but that was in the long ago, and he is
never likely to do anything of the kind again
Nowadays he is only a dummy acting for some
big pawn-broking institution or alleged “bank,”
and he occupies a position which is very difficult
to define. If he has a good year he is no better off
than before, for the “bank ’ absorbs the profits ;
if he has a bad year he goes through the Insol-
vency Court to try and square up his difficulties,
and the “bank ” declares a dividend of 8 per cent,
par annum with its customary affability, also a
bonus of 2j) per cent. ; and carries an amount
equal to dividend and bonus combined to the
credit of a fund for the equalisation of dividends,
and also adds something to the reserve and carries
the rest forward. If you take up a daily paper
anywhere you will find its columns filled witt
long lists of financial companies old and new, com
panies projected, companies in course of forma-
tion, companies in all stages of development, am
there seems to be no end of them. W ith us nov
the cats are dying, the rabbits are dying, tb-
’possums and kangaroos are dying, even the pay
toralists themselves are dying, but the “ banks ’
prosper and get more numerous every day, and
their dividends grow larger and their director
more corpulent, and everything is gay. To be s
bloated “ squattah ” now isn’t the thing that it i
cracked up to be, dear Bulletin. If you have i
son better bring him up to be a “bank.”—Yours

observes :
It has now bean satisfactorily preyed that the work o'
irrigation may be successfully applied to unproductive
lands, so as to effect their fertilization and render then
capable of remunerative cultivation.
Here, indeed, is a marvellous discovery, just made
by the great Parkes in the hundredth year of the
colony of N.S. Wales What though the meanest
Chinese cabbage-raiser will tell you that the be
nighted pagans of the East successfully practised
the art of irrigation (not parliamentary or throat
irrigation, but common or garden irrigation) ovei
40 centuries ago ! Those people are all dead
while the great Parkes is alive, and he has in-
vented irrigation— now, at a time when a pack of
miserable mummies haven’t energy enough left tc
discover a way of wriggling out of their respectivi
dead-houses. All glory be to the great Hi Ham,
therefore, for his marvellous ingenuity, and let

Region of damper and “junk ” and tea,
Region of pastures wide !
The fairest spots in the world to me
Are out in the Lachlan Side
I’m off to the Lachlan Side,
Where the bright lagoons are wide ;
I long for river and grass and tree
And someone dearer than all to me,
Far out on the Lachlan Side.
My heart was hardened against advice
And reason 1 would not see,
For by the ocean a paradise
The city appeared to me.
( Chorus).
“Not I for a bumpkin’s fate,” I cried,
“ I’ll not be a country clown !
A life’s too slow on the Lachlan Side;
I’ll go to the shining town !”
I’ve lost the battle, I strike the flag,
The town may sink in the tide ;
A wiser head and a lighter swag
I take to the Lachlan Side.
When crops of wool on the plains shall grow,
Shall flourish in drought or rain,
And when the shearers begin to mow
I’ll come to the town again.
But now I go to a kinder fate.
If her love still conquers pride ;
Her heart was true when she sobbed “ I’ll wait
For you on the Lachlan Side.
HENKY LAWSON.
October, 1888.

genuine Insect Destroying Powder, being certain death to
all kinds of insects, while it is perfectly harmless to animal
life, and therefore may be used without the slightest
apprehension. For the extermination of Mosquitos
especially, the Insecticide has no equal—as the fumes of
the burnt powder, while throwing off a pleasant odour
are at the same time most destructive to them. Sold In

D* RICH ARDS
This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life-
time to the study of
Trivate, nervous, and skin
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to his
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.
YOUNG MEN
Who suffer from the results of early follies, trans-
gressions or excesses of more mature age, blad-
der difficulties, a whitish or dark ropy sedi-
ment in the water, accompanied by slight
burning or smarting sensation, Headaches,
Drowsiness during the day, circles around
the eyes, Giddiness, irregularity of the
bowels, specks before the eyes, bashfulness,
discontentedness, weakness or pains in the back,
Liver or Kidney complaints, dreams, buzzing
noises in the ears and head, pimples, a fear that
something dreadful is about to happen, weak
stomach, yellow or blood-shot eyes, impure blood,
hasty, uncontrollable temper, hacking cough, who
cannot honourably marry, nervousness in society,
wakefulness, palpitation of the heart, general
weakness, and other symptoms which lead to in-
sanity and death, should consult him, for he has
mastered these difficulties. On receipt of 6d. in
stamps he will send secure from observation in a
plain wrapper, postage
FREE, A LARGE CLOTH-BOUND
BOOK.
Showing plainly how all diseases of the private or
nervous system may be cured thoroughly and per-
manently without unnecessary expense. This
book will prove a valuable companion, and even
though you be perfectly well its general informa-
tion and prescription may assist you in restoring
some poor friend to health even after his case has
been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tendant.
ONE POUND IS SUFFICIENT TO
SEND
for Remedies necessary for the cure of NER-
VOUS DEBILITY. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
gerous, it would be advisable for you to sit down
quietly in your chamber and write to the Doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. He will
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
opinion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, send for his famous medical
work, the price of which is but sixpence; enclosed
in the volume will be found a list of carefully-pre-
pared questions, which will, in all propability,
assist you materially in describing your ail-
ment. Dr. Richards uses nothing but the purest
remedies, and never prescribes mercury under any
circumstances. The moment letters are carefully
perused and answered they are destroyed by fire,
and patients may rest assured that their cases will
remain a secret between the doctor and themselves.
Dr. Richards has successfully treated nearly 25,000
cases since coming to Australia, and has permis-
sion from at least 10,000 persons to show their
written evidence of his success. All communica-
tions should be addressed

[COPY.]
Glenhope, 19th July 1880
To B. E. Kuqrlmann, Esq., Professor of Natural
Science, &o.
Dear Sir, —This is to certify that I, Frank E. E. Knight,
of Glenhope, was taken ill with a severe cough about July,
1883, but, thinking it was only a severe cold, I did not
take any notice of it for about six months, when 1 com-
menced to expectorate blood and matter very freely. I
then thought it was time to consult a medical man, and I
went into Heathcote, and was treated for four months, but
without receiving any benefit. I then consulted a doctor
la Kyneton of considerable repute for six months, and,
although I failed to obtain the slightest relief, he told me
that I was all right, only requiring warm weather to com-
plete the cure, which statement I did not believe, and
accordingly consulted another doctor in Kyneton, and
Informed him of the statement of my previous medical
attendant, when he informed me that I was in a most un-
healthy state, and prescribed for me, and after treating me
for. five months, he honestly informed me that my case was
Incurable, and that it was useless to attend him any longer,
and he advised me not to take any more chemists’ medi-
cines, as all I had taken for the last 15 months was poison.
I then pressed him for a true statement of my case, and he
very reluctantly informed me that I was suffering from
Ulcerated Lungs or Consumption, and that I was quite in-
curable. During the time I was attended by the above
doctors, I was not able to lie down in my bed, and ex-
pectorated many quarts of blood and matter from my
lungs, and I lost weight rapidly. About this time I saw
your advertisement and decided to consult you, which I
did in March, 1885, when you greatly astonished me by
Informing me minutely of the exact nature of my com-
plaint without my giving you any information, and even
without your having sounded or examined me. But my
astonishment was greatly increased when you told me that
you could guarantee to cure me upon a definite agreement,
which I gladly availed myself of. After having taken your
medicines for a month I was considerably worse ; expec-
torating very much, and throwing up several pieces of
skin from my lungs about the size of the palm of my hand;
but after this crisis I commenced to improve very fast.
After three months’treatment the expectoration and cough
entirely left me, and I had gained over two stone in weight,
a result which my friends considered little short of mira-
culous, as all expected I would soon die ; and from that
time (thanks to your most wonderful skill and ability) I
have not felt any return of my complaint, and my lungs
are as strong as ever they were, and I can do as good and
as hard a day’s work as I ever did. lam sure that people
diseased and suffering should avail themselves of your
treatment, and not delay as I did until I was given up to
die.—l remain, ever thankfully yours PRANK E E

The coming dissolution of the Victorian
Aseemb’.y h casting shadows before. A funny
shadow is the poking of an Oppo ition pamphlet
under the susceptible elector’s front door, said
pamphlet being the true aud particular account of
a certain “Banquet in Recognition of the Personal
Merits and Public Services of The Honourable
Thotras Bent.” This Irstoric ceremony orcurred
last May, and was managed by a snug clique of
patriots who whitewashed Thomas and were, in
return, whitewashed by him, until the driven
snow was a fool to them. The meeting ultimately
dispersed in a decidedly wet coacit'cn with a
muzzy conviction that some “ Aqe slander ” had
been “refuted,” and the world has since gone on

Editor BuLtikixir Sir,—By no means a ,
bad sketch Mrould be half-a-doZm imthense rail-
way-engines—lady delegates—drawing one insig-
nihcaht little waggon—the N.S. W. Women’s
Indufct.ial Exhibition. As an exhibition of the
wdrk of the womeil of the colony it was a failure.
Most Women appear to have been too sensible to
send their work, but a few innocents, inex-
perienced in the ways of “the Points,” brought
tieir work to the building in Prince Alfred
Park, there to meet with scant courtesy, sickening
condescension, or to be completely ignored Had

ton, Lady Martin, the Mayoress, and some othe rs
who appeared, amid the general mismanagement,
petsomnca ions of gentleness and courtesy, been
at the head of affairs, with only professional women
to help them, the Exhibition might have been a
success In all affairs of this kind we may notice
in the very front rank women who are uto* rly
Uaa' le to influence their fellow-women, unless it
be to provoke them —I am, yours, etc., Mar-

A c aak who lately suicided in New Zea-
land hit instructions that his head should be sent
to Professor Halford, the Melbourne anatomist.
Which biings to our memory a gruesome dispute
about a dt ad man’s brains, in which the learned
Professor figured. Some years ago an attempt
was made, in bread day-light, by some armed
ruffians, to stick up the E.S, and A.C. Bank in
George-streeb, Fitzroy (Vic.) The attempt was
frustrated by the pluck of Mr. John Dowling, the
manager (afterwards chief of the head-office in
Sydney), now dead, and the muscular Mr. De
Jersey Grut, armed with a certain heavy brass
candlestick Two of the would-be robbers, Woods
and Carver, were convicted and sentenced to be
hanged. About this time a tragedy was enacted
in front of the Public Works office, in Lonsdale-
streeb. Two men, partners in a Government con-
tract, had come to a dispute over the business.
The one who held the cash refused to part the
men’s wages ; the other, a sensitive, honourable
man, exasperated at this, and harassed by men
importuning him for money, made a final demand
for cash, and on its being refused drew a revolver
andshobhispartnerdead. Hewasbried, convicted,
and sentenced to the scaffold. Strenuous efforts
were made to save him on the grounds of insanity,
most of the medical experts being of opinion that
his brain was diseased Little doubt existed at
the time that he would have been saved but for
the unfortunate fact that Woods and Carver were
bo die, and they had actually killed no one.
Harrison had, and all three had been convicted at
the same Sessions and were to be hanged upon the
same morning. Sir James M'Culloch, who was
Chief Secretary, declared he could not see his way
to save one while the others had to go, and so all
three went—Woods dancing a hornpipe and sing-
ing an obscene song a few moments before he gave
the community their great Moral Lesson. At the
post-mortem examination by some means the brain
of Harrison was clandestinely taken from the
operating-room and brought before a meeting of
medical men presided over by Professor Halford,
who had been most energetic in his efforts to save
the man’s life. This meeting was being held in a
room over the book-store of George Robertson, in
Collins-street, when Claude Farie, the sheriff
of the day, suddenly made his appearance
with an order from the Chief Secretary for
the “brains,” alleging that they were Government
property—in fact, they were the “ Government’s
brains,” and the Government was waiting for
them The faculty for a time declined 10 sur-
render the disputed assets, but the Sheriff i ven-
tually succeeded in recovering h’s stolen treasure,
the professor and his colleagues being candid
enough to admit that there was no disease ap
parent Dr. M‘Crea Government medical
officer, by whom Sir James M'Calloch “swore,”
had declared all through that he would stake his
reputation there was no disc ase.
A Northern paper has some prison-
sketches by “one who has been there” Who
said we did not believe in capital punishment?
This man lias “ drawn,” let him now be “ hanged
and quartered.”

of the S. M. Herald i
TDUBLIG NOTICE—The business of the firm of
Tuclp Chong, and Co:, of Ift George-street, Syd-
ney, has closed ; liabilities discharged and debts col-
lec ed; All accounts against the paid firm are re-
quested to seed in their bills before lsth instant,
otherwise we refuse to pay, for we leave the colony
after the date atove mentioi ed. Tuck, Chong, and
Co.
After that, who will say that the Chow is not
fitted for the highest walks of commerce? There
is a sledge hammer vigour ab ut the way in which
Tuck, Chong, and Go. refuss to pay unless “all
accounts fend in their bills” iromptly, which
mikf s us think that the invoice which didn’t for-
ward ids statement in rood time would stand a
fair show to be left.
