The Co-Operative
SYSTEM, the nearest approach to Socialism that can be achieved under the
present conditions of life, has met with phenomenal success wherever it has
been applied to any object. In England, even the Co-operative Societies
benefit some millions of persons—their membership exceeding a million and
a-half, and hold invested capital to the amount of eleven millions of money.
This success is owing to the fact that the investor secs not only a fair cofn-
■ mercial return on his investment, but a proprietary division of profits, which
he would not receive from any other organisation. It has been left to Aus-
tralia to apply this communistic principle to

SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 5, 1891.
The Abolition of Lawyers.
About two-fifths, or possibly one-half, of the
civilised human race is made up of commer-
cial and other cormorants of various degrees.
The old, baseless copy-book assertion, accord-
J ng to which industry is the sure road to
affluence, is an extinct superstition, and has
died an unnatural death of hunger and old
age. The way to affluence is a road that is
paved with commissions, and pickings, and
perquisites, and miscellaneous steals. The
self-made individual still serves as a bright
and shining light to the rising generation,
but the assertion that he rose through
industry and profound integrity is a lie and
an exploded tradition. Nobody, under any
cii’cunxstances whatsoever, does rise through
.sheer industry. By dixit of toil and mean-
ness it is possible to rise high enough to
become an employer and embezzle the fruits
of other men's labour, or to become a mom -
polist, and clean out other xxien by specula-
tive enterprises, but the person who rises by
honest energy only rises to be a cockatoo
farmer, or a boss stonebreakcr, or the prin-
cipal pick-axxd-shovel nxaxx in a road-gang.
Beyond these grades there is xxothing but
the great army of cormorants the countless
hosts of merchants, brokers, jobbers, bag-
men, dealers, accountants, bankers, agents,
lawyers, and others of the same kind, who
xxxake up that complex system which is called
civilisatioix. And the torpid x'ace of those
who are eaten have learned to accept (his
state of things as one of the xxecessities of
life, and to look upon the eaters as essential
members of the great scheme of Providence.
Such a proposition as the utter abolition of
lawyers iix all their varieties would probably
be looked upon as three-parts unreasoning
Vandalism and one-part coxxfirmed insanity,
for though the lawyer is admittedly a
bird of prey he is a constitutional and
old-established bird of prey —an elo-
quent bird of prey—the sort of bird
of prey who can only grow in an edu-
cated and refined community, and he is one
of the landmarks of progress, and a deep-
rooted institution generally. Therefore,
when- The Bulletin suggests that the
lawyer—as one among the great assemblage
of evil parasites—should be abolished so
utterly that ixo one shall ever find him
again, and that people will even forget that
he ever existed, it fully expects to be
denounced as a Vandal, and rather likes the
term than otherwise. Even the \ andal had
sundry good points, which history has
mostly ignored.
It is freely admitted by three-fourths of
the nation that the lawyer is a necessary
evil ; The Bulletin, on the other hand,
admits the evil and absolutely denies the
necessity. Or, if ho is necessary, it is
merely because he makes his own necessity.
He is an animal that travels in a circle, and
he is essential on account of his existence ;
if he did not exist he would not he essen-
tial. In other words, he lives to fill a
certain purpose, and he first of ail makes
the purpose, and then fills it. He is the
sole cause of himself, and he is also the effect
of his own cause. The business of his life is
to dig a hole, and then fill it up again, and
to charge both for the digging and the
filling; he also creates the original necessity
for the hole, and charges for that likewise.
Therefore if he is necessary he is necessary
only to himself, and if he supplies a long-
felt want it is his own want, and is only felt
by himself. And by-and-hye the nation will
realise that the man who wants himself, but
who is wanted by nobody else, has no right
to charge the public for supplying himself,
any more than the man who is hungry
should.charge for being hungry, and then
charge for eating, and finally send in a third
ponderous bill for not feeling hungry after
he has finished eating.
* * *
The lawyer exists, in the first place, to
expound the law. There is absolutely no
reason why (he law should want to be ex-
pounded at great expense, any more than
the newspaper ; if the law were made to be
as simple and as easy of comprehension as a
decently-written newspaper, then the race of
lawyers would presently become extinct,
and if the newspapers were made as dark
and profound and complicated as the law,
then a new race of practitioners would arise,
who would charge many guineas for reveal-
ing the hidden meaning of an item about a
drunk being fined ss. The cause of this
state of things is in every sense the lawyer
himself. In the first place, he makes the
law. The Legislature of every “civilised”
country is full of barristers and solicitors,
and all important measures are drafted by
one or other of those persons. They are
drawn up, not in the language of the country,
but in a strange and murky gibberish, for
the sufficient reason that the legal prac-
titioner is mentally fuddled by the influence
of many huge blue documents filled with
interminable miles of a decomposed dialect
of his own. Therefore, he is necessary, in
the first place, to construct a statute, fox no
one save himself can write that strange and
battered Yolapuk in which tradition demands
all statutes should be written ; and he is
necessary again, in the second place, because
no one else can comprehend it when it is
written And, in addition to all this, lie is
required for all manner of archseological
researches, for the country is full of old, for-
gotten statutes, which no one has time to
hunt up excepting a man who gives his whole
life to the task ; and yet, unless they are
hunted up, and a watchful eye kept upon
them, no one can tell whether he may not
bo liable to death by judicial strangulation
for wheeling a bai’row in the street con-
trary to the regulations of some dead
and dusty monarch of old, whose bones
have long since degenerated into grit, and
whose memory is forgotten, and his monu-
ment sold for a gatepost. These weird old
statutes originally existed because they wore
made by lawyers ; they keep on existing
because the great army of lawyers who
crowd the Legislature have so far successfully
resisted every effort towards their abolition ;
and the lawyer himself exists because of the
existence of the laws. Thus he goes round
in a never-ending circle, and his head is
caused by his tail, and his tail is the origin
and reason of his head ; and he is present
because he is a public necessity, and he is a
public necessity because he is present, and
for no other motive whatever.
# # #
The lawyer, however, makes only a small
part of his profits by expounding the misty
and muddled code of the land. The largest
part of his takings are gained by picking
holes in the statutes, and perverting justice
by reason of some shadow of doubt which
rests upon some obscure clause or section or
sub section of the Act. For, because of the
existence rf the lawyer, the simplest Act of
Parliament must not only state conclusively
what it does mean, bub must also state, with
a long weariness of incessant iteration that
it does not mean anything else in heaven or
earth or sea, or any other place or state or
condition whatsoever. And as no Act ever
can enumerate a I the things it does not
mean, and state in tones of thunder that it
does not mean any of them, therefore there
are from one to a dozen flaws in every
statute ; and in every case which is heard in
the courts there arc from one to a dozen
costly advocates hired to find technical ob-
jections, and a similar gang on the other
s'dc to find holes in these objections,
and technical blunders in the techni-
calities. This is the highest art of
the legal profession, and the most expen-
sive brigand in the great army of thieves is
the one who can most successfully blast the
cause of justice and equity on some point
concerning the date at which some useless
document was put on a tile in an equally use-
less public office, and left there, and for-
gotten. And this art exists solely because
of the existence of the lawyer, for even (he
most obtuse of Judges if he is morally
qualified to be a Judge —can generally strike
a fair average as to the meaning of any
statute upon his own responsibility ; thcre-
fore, the business of the talented barrister is
to prevent him discovering that meaning,
and to howl him into a state of judicial
lunacy.. And by virtue of this same art,
other lawyers draft new Acts, and pile up
mountains upon mountains of verbiage, not
to define what the law is, but to prevent it
being defined as the thousand and one things
that it is not. Consequently Acts are made
more unfathomable and incomprehensible
in the effort to baffle and suppress the
lawyer, and through this same incomprelxen-
siblencss it is necessary to hire lawyers to
define their meaning before they arc of the
slightest use to the community at large.
The situation of the legil practitioner would
be identical with that of the rabbit if the
country had to buy an enormously expen-
sive rabbit in the first place, and a costly
fence to keep him out in the second, and
then to keep on buying more rabbits and
more fences to all eternity.

Jn the administration of criminal law the
lawyer certainly looks a shade less useless and
noxious than in the civil courts, but even
there he is entirely superfluous. It is un-
doubtedly a noble anti laudable thing to
defend those who are unjustly accused, but
it is only the ideal practitioner who does
this ; the real or garden variety of advocate
exists for quite a different purpose. Criminal
law depends less upon technicalities and the
elaborate obfuscation of the code, and much
more upon questions of actual fact, than
does the civil variety ; and the business of
each lawyer is to pervert the facts to the
last extremity; and each side requires a
lawyer simply because its own facts arc
being perverted by the man in the opposite
interest, therefore it becomes necessary to
hire somebody to pervert his facts by way of
retaliation. If no lawyers existed, then it
is only fair to assume that the facts on either
side would stand a much better show than
they do under existing conditions. Mean-
while the party which can afford to pay the
best perverter prospers, and the party
whose poverty compels him to be satisfied
with a cheap and inefficient perverter is
hanged : and the individual whom the law
gets hold of is not the one who is guilty,
but the one who has lacked the means to
engage an able and experienced falsi-
fier. Very often, of course, it gets the
real criminal, but that is a mere coincidence ;
it does not get him because of his criminality,
but because he had a cheap lawyer or none
at all And here again, the lawyer creates
the demand for his own existence, and if he
didn’t exist there would be no demand at
all.
# # *
Apart from those services the lawyer
answers a few other purposes ( f more or less
importance. He does a good business as a
conveyancer, because he has so elaborately
compounded the statutes (hat no one can
buy or sell land without hiring an expensive
professional individual to show him how to
do it. The conveyance of land is not neces-
sarily any more complex than the convey-
ance of sugar done up in a brown paper
bag, bub having successfully covered the
operati u with a veil of profound mystery,
he makes a handsome profit thereby. Sooner
or later, however, the world will abolish
lawyers and the statutes of their construc-
tion, and in so doing will simplify the pro-
cess of land-transfer till the conveyancer is
unnecessary. And then, as the natural con-
comitant of tliis reform, it will abolish the
whole system of private property in land,
and land-transfers will become extinct,
because no one will possess any land to
transfer. Also, the legal brotherhood sup-
plies advisers to the Government, for no
Government can find its way among the
maze of its own lawyer-built Acts of Par-
liament without professional aid, or
understand i s own meaning without expen-
sive outside assistance ; it acts as general
interpreter of sewage and ash-cart ordinances
to municipal bodies, for even the bye laws
concerning an ash-cart are too i rofound
for the ordinary lay comprehension ;
and it steers joint - stock companies
through the devious ways in which they can
clean out the general public without getting
into gaol. Further, it supplies occupants
for the bench, which is a most essential
function, not because legal training is
necessary for the administration of justice,
but because the Judge has to deal with laws
that are written in a legal jargon of unspeak-
able muddlement, and to strike a legal
average between the barrister who is lying
for the prosecution and the barrister who is
not telling the truth for the defence. The
lawyer makes the Judge—as that individual
is now understood—an essential element of
the legal machinery. If the lawyer were
abolished, and the statutes which he has
constructed replaced by a code written in
plain and simple English, then the sole
business of the Judge would be to
administer even-handed justice instead
of wading through a jungle of tangled
technicalities, and the judicial office
could be efficiently filled by any man en-
dowed with liberal views, a logical brain,
and a rcasonably-widc knowledge of the
world in general. And here again the
lawyer is the cause of himself, and makes
the demand for his own existence. The
world does not want him in any sense what-
ever. He only wants himself, and makes
the world pay the bill, and when the world
begins to realise the situation it will pay the
hill no longer, and in the great host of birds
of prey there will he one ravenous cormorant
the less.
The Matrimonial Partnership.
Sir Alfred Stephen in a recent letter to the
S.M. Herald, under the heading of “ Wives
and their Friends,” ((notes a case lately decided
in England, which throws a peculiar light
on the position held by married women accord-
ing to English law
According to English law, a wife could hriupr no action
for injuries done to her, without his (the husband's) con-
s nit; the redress being given, not to her, but to him. if
the husband was the wrongdoer, ndress was almost im-
possible. As a case illustrative of the complete helpless-
ness of women in England only a few years ago, I submit
the following; —lt was a case in which a woman bad boon
deserted for many years by her husband, who had gone to
America. She was a working woman, and just gained
enough to live upon, and to bring up a family of
small children whom the husband had left on
her hands, She met with a railway accident and
was seriously injured. When she attempted to bring an
action for damages against the railway company, the
company successfully defended it and obtained a non-
suit oh the ground that, being a married woman, she
couid not sue for damages for any wrong that had been
done to her. Someone took up her case, and after much
difficulty found the husband in America, and induced him
to allow himself to be joined in the suit with his wife, so
that she could sue the railway company. As it was shown
that she was incapacitated for the rest of her life from
earning her livelihood, the railway company was ordered
to pay £lOOO damages. This was not, of course, a very
large sum ; but it was sufficient to have kept the unfor-
tunate woman out of the workhouse. But the husband
had been too well informed of his and ids wife's legal
position. When the £lOOO came (o be paid, lie held out
Ids band for the cheque. It was necessarily paid to Idm
tlie law so ordered it in compensation for the damage
done to Ids property. With that money he rcinnud lo
America, leaving the woman who had suffered the damage
to go into the workhouse, without a penny to support
her.

This quotation is eloquent regarding the
position of women as Property according to the
reading of English law by the leading publicists
of the English law-courts themselves. Charles
Letourneau, in his admirable monograph on
“The Evolution of Marriage and of the
Family,” is at especial pains to collect evidence
from among savage tribes and rudimentary
societies proving the origin of all marriage in a
purchase of merchantable property, and the
utter impossibility of the primitive wife having
any concern in her own interests, or any pro-
perty of her own whatever. According to the
above quotation, however, M. Letourneau
could have amassed all his examples, not from
the practices and customs of savage and prehis-
toric tribes, but from the existing statute-books
of the most civilised peoples of Europe. As the
marriage and divorce laws of the greater part
of the most advanced of modern nations now
stand, the position of the wife is little better
than that of any other property —a thing owned,
having no share in her husband’s rights save
the share of a serf or of a servant. The worst
part of it all is that there is no attempt put
forth by law-makers to better woman’s position
as a wife on a broad and logical basis of justice.
Attempts there arc to give to women the fran-
chise, to open the University to female students,
to broaden the avenues to divorce. But divorce
is in itself only a pulling down ; it is not a
building up.
* # #
Is not all this an attempt at re-adjustment at
the wrong end? Why should not the conditions
of marriage be more equitable ? There are two
ways of doing this, and they are not difficult to
seek. The first way is one which would bo
tolerated by no civilised community, simply
because it would mean a return to free love,
promiscuity, and barbarism. It would mean
the denial of paternity, the non-recognition and
the non-intervention of the State in all conjugal
contracts, the refusal of the responsibilities of
heredity, and the abolition of bastardy and the
bcqueathal of property by descent. The other
way is plain, logical, and just. Let the State
discard all sentimentality in the matter and
consider the marital union as a purely business
contract, like any other form of commercial
partnership. What does a woman gain
financially, say, by divorce from a man
who is consigned to gaol for some offence
against the laws of his country ? When the
man has fulfilled his term of punishment he
cannot reclaim her —that is all. Put it on
another basis. Regard bis committal to prison
as compulsory sequestration of a legal partner
in an estate. Wind up bis business and pay
over the just share in such business to his
partner, who may lie hereafter properly regarded
as his widow. Let the terms of every marital
contract be accurately set forth in a legal docu-
ment which shall stand in law as a genuine
deed of partnership, and in which the rights of
the wife shall be absolutely assured. A writer
in one of the English magazines recently pro-
posed a method by which all forms of brcach-
of-promise of marriage should be settled by a
similar means. . He suggested that the contract-
ing parties should sign bonds pledging them-
selves to observe the terms of the instru-
ment, Subject to certain conditions which should
constitute just grounds of evasion of fulfilment,
under a penalty of so much money ; the deed to
be duly witnessed as all other business agree-
ments are. This, in the writer’s opinion, would
abolish at one stroke the whole work of the
Courts in the matter of breaeh-of-promise
cases. Apply this system also to marriage
itself. Secure the position of the wife against
the husband as a business partner is secured,
and a case similar to that instanced by Sir
Alfred Stephen would not only be improbable
—it would be impossible.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
"One Pirst-Class Policeman!"
A few days ago a man (whoso name, as he was
acquitted, there is no reason to give) was
charged in a Sydney court with attempted
stealing. It was only “attempted conse-
quently there were no material evidences hi
prisoner’s possession to support the charge. The
case consisted of one policeman who said that
the prisoner had been trying to steal, and one
prisoner who said that he hadn’t. The jury
gave the alleged offender the benefit of the
doubt, and Judge M‘Faeland, who seemed
almost petrified with amazement, received the
verdict with this memorable observation ;
Not guilty ! Is that really your verdict, gentlemen,
after lira i inn the evidence of a first-class constable f


The inference to be drawn from this is that the
evidence of one whole and complete policeman
is expected to have a paralysing effect on a
buy, and to swamp all outside statements,
just here it seems to be a serious pity that the
Bible wasn’t written by a first-class constable,
so as to suppress criticism. The average
Judge —and most Judges are very average
individuals —will go the whole judicial hog on
the testimony of one “cop,” and evidently
looks on that individual as something more than
human. Yet the “cop” differs from the ordinary
citizen only in Ids clothes, and as it is the man
that swears, and not the clothes, his testimony
is just the testimony of an ordinary human
being after all. He is selected chiefly on account
of his dimensions, and there is no reason at all
to suppose that a large man is any more reliable
than a small one. In the prisoner’s case it was
the unsupported statement of one constable
against the equally unsupported statement of
one prisoner. The fact that the latter teas a
prisoner doesn’t necessarily invalidate his testi-
mony ; anybody is a prisoner as soon as an
officer seizes him, and an officer may seize any-
body-—he may even grab Parkes off his veran-
dah if he is a new officer, and knows no better.
Moreover, every man is assumed to be innocent
until proved guilty, and, therefore, by all
the canons of law, it was merely a case
in which one innocent citizen swore to a
certain statement and another innocent citizen
contradicted him. The prisoner had every reason
to swear as he did for his liberty was at stake.
The officer also might have had —we make no
personal allegation —reason to swear as he did,
for —despite all theories to the contrary —a
policeman’s promotion depends upon his effici-
ency, and an efficient policeman is a policeman
who secures convictions. There is absolutely
no reason to assume that this particular officer
was giving false evidence ; but the one point
for the jury to consider, was that the constable
and the prisoner had exactly the same reasons
for swearing truly, and also for swearing falsely.
And, in addition to all this, there was the
further chance that the policeman had drawn a
wrong inference; there was no evidence of
theft —merely an assumption, which might have
been incorrect, that theft was intended. The
Jury gave the prisoner the benefit of the doubt
—no honest jury could have done otherwise—
and then Judge M'Farland jumped at them
with both judicial feet —not upon the facts of
the case, but for not being paralysed at the
sight of “ a first-class constable. ” And as they
were engaged to consider the evidence, and not
to be paralysed by any constable, this was
eminently unreasonable in every sense.
Divorce by Mutual Consent.
At the present moment there are confined in
Darlinghurst Prison, Sydney, 20 individuals
charged with wife-desertion, and two charged
with wife-and-child desertion, making 22 in all.
These may be regarded asbut a small part of a very
large accumulation, for the absconding husbands
who have paid up the amounts demanded by
Saw for the support of their wives are at liberty;
and so are the individuals who have not paid up,
but have gone a-missing and can’t be found;
and those who have not paid up and can be
found, but against whom their wives have taken
no further proceedings. Also, the list does not
include those against whom no proceedings were
taken at all, because they vanished completely
at the very outset, or for other reasons ; and,
further, it only includes male absconders, and
of escaped wives there is no record whatever.
But with these five exceptions, covering, most
probably, at least 90 per cent, of the total, the 22
prisoners in Darlinghurst represent fairly well
the last few weeks’ business in this particular
department of crime in a certain limited area
around Sydney ; and if the prisoners in othe r
gaols are also taken into account, and the total
is multiplied by three or four, a fair idea may
be arrived at of the number of marriages that
have been unofficially cancelled within a brief
period in N.S. Wales. Practically, these are all
■cases of divorce, only the slow and melancholy
Law refuses to understand the fact. The essence
<of marriage is the union of two individuals,
■and when these two individuals are permanently
disunited, then the marriage is cancelled. The
mere circumstance that the statute fails to recog-
nise the situation, has no possible bearing on
the case. Under a system of divorce by mutual
consent, no doubt the larger proportion of the
unhappy marriages which have concluded so
disastrously in Darlinghurst and elsewhere
would long since have been obliterated, to the
.great relief of both parties concerned ; for the
absconding husband, by the mere act of abscond-
ing, may be reasonably held as signifying his
desire to be set free, and the deserted wife, in a
very large number of cases, would gladly get
rid of what is merely an unprofitable incubus.
But neither Shiels of Victoria nor Jawbone
Neild of New South Wales—the twin apostles
of progress in this direction—have yet dared to
suggest that divorce should be permitted merely
for the reason that both parties want it. It is
difficult to imagine a better reason ; if the only
two individuals concerned desire to be set free
from each other it is their own affair, and
nobody else has any possible right to interfere ;
mid if divorce cannot be allowed because
everybody interested is anxious to have it, it is
difficult to imagine any set of conditions
under which a sane law-maker would allow it.
Nevertheless, it is held by every Australian
Court that “ collusion ” is a sufficient reason
why a decree of separation should be refused ;
in other words, when the Judge suspects that
the two individuals concerned are both agree-
able, he at once rejects the petition from legally
authorised cussedness ; but if one of the parties
objects strongly, then he goes ahead from pure
contrariness. His avowed reason for doing
this is that divorce by consent is immoral—
though why it is specially immoral has never
yet been explained. s> And apparently both
flie Judge and the Legislature entirely
fail to see that it doesn’t matter in any
way—so far as the court is concerned—whether
the system is immoral or not. It exists with-
out the recognition of the law; if the law
recognised it, it couldn’t exist any more than it
does already. By refusing to recognise it the
law may force both divorced parties into sub-
sequent immorality, but beyond that it can do
nothing. Divorce by mutual consent practi-
cally exists in several of the States of America,
and the great army of orthodoxists point woe-
fully to the vast array of judicial separations
which this nefarious law brings to pass. Yet,
after all, separations are as plentiful in the
moral land of Australia—the only difference is
that the law refuses to register them. And in
like manner the law might refuse to register
deaths, but people would die just the same, and
Australia would be none the healthier by virtue
of that non-registration. To argue against an
accomplished fact by refusing to put it down
on paper is worse even than the proceeding of
the ostrich, which refuses to recognise its
pursuer’s existence by hiding its head in the
sand. For in this case the Law goes one
better, by denying that there is any ostrich or
any sand at all.
In Liquidation,
At the present moment a vast array of old
banks, caved-in building-societies and exploded
financial institutions, scattered over all parts of
Australia, Tasmania and Maoriland, are
struggling through the slow process of liquida-
tion. How many there are it is impossible to
count, for many of them started liquidating in
the days of ancient history, and their names are
all but forgotten, and the shareholders have
faded away, and the creditors are buried or
burst, and yet the long, long process of
liquidating keeps going on for ever. It is the
dreariest process that ever was invented in all
the moral wastes of commerce. When a public
institution bursts up, it always bursts with a
substantial balance to the good—on paper, at
all events; and there is the inevitable
assurance that the creditors will be paid in full,
and something will remain over for the share-
holders. Then a pompous accountant or finan-
cier, whose stomach alone suggests solidity and
financial responsibility, is appointed to wind
things up at a handsome salary, paid regularly;
and he rents an expensive office, and hires
most of his friends and relatives to
help him liquidate. Then it is discovered that
the market is unfavourable, and the properties
can’t be disposed of till better times arrive, and
while he is waiting for these better times the
staff still sits around, and draws its salary, and
liquidates. Ponderous reports are drawn up
at an extra remuneration of £2 an hour or there-
abouts, and then an expensive hall is hired for
these reports to be read in. A high-priced
solicitor and an expensive barrister start to
argue before a costly Judge about the “ list of
contributories,” and then they have sundry
appeals over the matter, and at intervals the
ease is “ mentioned ” in court. The assets fade
away in postage - stamps, gas, office - rent,
salaries, tips, commissions, repairs to empty
houses, more commissions to the agent who
doesn’t let the empty houses, advertising, taxes,
legal expenses through hiring a costly solicitor
to write to each man who owes 2s. fid., legal
expenses perusing the reply in which he repudi-
ates the 2s. fid., more legal expenses through
the expensive barrister suing for the 2s. fid.,
court fees, &c., through the case being
again “ mentioned,” and still more barristers
and solicitors and court fees to discover
whether it comes “within the meaning of
the Act. ” Then there are cross-actions because
some other defunct company bought a three-
cornered swamp, and mortgaged it to the bank,
and then sold it to this defunct company sub-
ject to the mortgage, and the bank sold the
mortgage to a three-ball Hebrew, and the com-
pany sold the land to some swindled labourer
on time-payment and couldn’t give him a title,
and the Hebrew went for the labourer, and
chaos ensued. Also, there are calls on the
shareholders to pay the liquidator’s screw and
the law expenses, and some of them bolt, and
some of them file, and the rest hire a whole
gang of barristers, and talk each other to death
in court. Meanwhile, the liquidation doesn’t
go on worth a cent, and many an institution
which started to wind up eight years ago hasn’t
even begun to make any progress yet. In fact,
the whole system is a delusion and an unspeak-
able fraud. It never produces any dividends ;
if the assets of the dead institution amount to
£10,000 and its liabilities are sixpence, the one
absolute certainty is that it will cost the
whole £10,000 to find out, by direction
of the Full Court, how to pay the sixpence.
The only short way out of the difficulty is to
trade off the properties of defunct banks and
building societies by means of lotteries, and
abolish the liquidator altogether—to raffle the
swamps, and allotments, and house properties,
and offices, and to put in the office furniture
and the bad debts as minor prizes. This
scheme would at least wind things up promptly,
and produce something in the way of hard cash,
and no other scheme yet invented has done
either. Also, it would be 16 times more moral
and less demoralising than horse-racing and
bookmaking; it would avert ruin from hundreds
of exhausted shareholders; and it would
furnish a cheap, profitable, and benevolent
recreation for the people ; and when the
creditors and shareholders were all paid any
surplus could be judiciously annexed by the
State, whereby the device would be good for
everybody and a beneficent thing all round.
And these should be the only lotteries per-
mitted by the State.
The pressure of public opinion is telling on the
Playford Government in South Australia.
Last year they displaced Dr. Cockburn’s
Cabinet on the ground that his progressive
land-tax was going too far and interfering with
the recognised rights of property, and they pro-
mised, if they got office, to keep things calm
and steady. Since then the increase of the
large estates and the growth of public opinion
in favour of more taxation on the land have
been about equal, and, bowing to the storm,
the Playford Government have introduced
four Bills, which rip up the Sacred rights of
property from the very foundations, and scatter
them to the winds in small and unrecognisable
fragments. They propose a tax of IJd. in the
pound on estates over £15,000 ; to give tenants
the right to turn their leases into freeholds
without the consent of the landlords ; to levy
stiff progressive legacy-duties, and to limit the
power of a man leaving landed property by will.
Up to the present the House of Assembly has
been so much stunned that it has only expressed
its surprise by inarticulate interjections, but
the liberal members will soon wake up to the
fact that the Bills are so drawn as to provide
that all these great changes are to take place
when everybody now living is thoroughly dead,
and therefore they are not calculated to do
much good to the present generation beyond
enabling the Playford gang to stop the agita-
tion for Cockburn’s progressive tax.
“A Loyal Australian,” who has evidently
spent many years in India, and thus speaks
from experience, writes to curse The Bulletin
hard in re an article entitled “ The Two
Governors-General.” The purpose of that
article was to use strong language about the
tyranny of Anglo-Indian officials in muzzling
the native press, and prosecuting native writers
who criticise British rule, and it alluded to this
state of things as “lop-sided justice.” Then
the “ Loyal Australian ” comes down heavily as
follows:
Lop-sided justice—good heavens ! Is the author of this
aware that every ofliuer administering justice in India
must have passed, at 23 years of age alnut, no loss than
three competitive examinations, the intense rigour of
which is without parallel in any country out of China?
For the first one, at 21, which is open to any legitimately
born subject of the empire, he must be able to stand the
most searching test human ingenuity can contrive of his
acquaintance with one dead language, and one or more
modern ditto. This has an.optional aspect, of course, but
one language besides his own, dead or alive, he has to be
011 the friendliest terms with, or fail. Then in mathe-
matics he has to foot every rung of that brain-crazing
mental exercise, besides which having to know Sanskrit
and become a walking Cyclopaedia as to such airy trifles
as English history from the Conquest to this year of
grace, and the same country’s literature as far back as
Chaucer, &c.
The Bulletin briefly replies to this prize idiot
that it doesn’t care a straw even if the boss
Anglo-Indian knows Choctaw, ancient Phoe-
nician, Eskimo metaphysics, and all the
languages that were spoken before the deluge.
Nero was a whale for knowledge, so were
Henry VIII., Amurath the Terrible, and half
the vilest scoundrels of history. The argu-
ment has no more bearing on the case than it
has upon the polar bear. Besides, if there is no
injustice in India because the civil servant has
to pass a stiff examination, then there must be
still less injustice—if that were possible—in
China, where, as the “ loyal Australian ”
admits, the examination is still stiffer.
Chinese “justice” is notoriously corrupt and
hideously brutal, which clearly proves that
equity doesn’t come out of competitive exams.
The writer then goes on to point to the
railways, waterworks, colleges, missionaries,
and the countless other benefits which
Britain has conferred on India. We
don’t publish this part of his letter, for we
admit the whole lot, railways, missionaries, and
all. And the entire accumulation have no con-
nection at all with the subject under discussion.
A Government may make 20,000,000 miles of
railway, and may fill all the land with mis-
sionaries till you fall over a preacher at every
corner, and every mud-pie that is thrown in the
whole empire hits some expounder in bis meek
and shining eye, but if that same Government
lias to muzzle the press then it is a Government
which can’t bear criticism. And even 20,000,000
more miles of railway and a thousand civil
service examinations can’t alter this infallible
inference in the least.
One of the urgent requirements of the demo-
cracy is the periodical election of magistrates
and Judges by the people. At stated intervals
—say once in every three years at the utmost—
the nation would then have an opportunity of
getting rid of the fools and incurable bigots, the
aggressive, hide-bound loyalists to a foreign
country, the “ hanging Judges,” the eccentric
idiots who pass ten-year sentences for petty
larceny, and the brutal bullies in horse-hair who
browbeat juries into returning verdicts on in-
sufficient evidence, all of whom are now almost
irremovable, for they can only be shifted by
death, or by the amputation of both legs. Also
there would then be a chance to get rid, by
some other process save that of old age and
senility, of the country Justice who knows no
law, and the lopsided, pig-headed city beak
who sends up the homeless citizen for 12 months
because he has no visible means of support, and
fines the person who has trodden on his wife in
the sum of 10s., with the alternative of
seven days. And further, it would pro-
vide a means of shunting the judicial
humourist with his imbecile grin, and the
judicial hyena with his howl and his bloodshot
eye, and the judicial drunk with his incoherent
notes and his general inability to tell which
individual is the prisoner and which is the
prosecuting counsel; likewise the Judge, who
owes money to both the litigant Hebrews before
him, and also to their attorneys, and to the
usurers of the city unto seventy times seven.
Lastly, and more important than all, it would
enable the people to cast out the judicial
snuffiebuster and to bounce the aggressive
Christian off the Bench. Appointing a man as
a J udge for life is as great a farce as nominating
a man to the Legislative Council for life. No
one can ever tell before a man is elevated to
the Bench what particular kind of monomaniac
he will prove to be —he is simply shunted on to
bis judicial seat as an irreparable, life-long
experiment. And, therefore, the whole system
is an outrage on democratic principles—an
insult to the common-sense of the nation—a
miserable foolishness —a perversion of justice,
and a dead failure. To appoint any man for
life to any particular post is only one remove in
its idiocy from appointing a dynasty to rule a
country.
“ Toowoomba ” writes to The Bulletin to ask
the old, old, weary conundrum—whether is
Protection or the Single-tax the better policy
for a new,country ? This is the same miserable
problem which turns up for over ami ever. The
average faddist can never hold more than one
fad at a time ; he never will realise that no
country can live on one nostrum only. If the
question were altered to read: “Is it best to
wear boots or a shirt?” he would probably
realise the situation, and reply that he wanted
both of them, and some other clothes as well,
but he never by any chance applies the same
rule to politics. And in any case the “Single-tax”
is drivelling insanity, for if Australia adopted
a “ Single-tax ” it would thereby prohibit itself
taxing Chinamen to keep down the Mongolian
influx, or taxing dogs to restrict the multiplica-
tion of mongrels, and it would make grog as
cheap as milk. The term Land Nationalisa-
tion was turned into the term “ Single-tax” by
a mendacious Foreign-trade party in order to
bolster up the lying legend that no Protec-
tionist can be an enemy of landlordism.
What anew country wants is Land Nationalisa-
tion, to ensure that the national wealth
shall be divided on an equitable basis, and Pro-
tection to make certain that there will be any
wealth to divide. Also, it wants Independence,
as a guarantee that the fruits of Protection and
Land Nationalisation shallnot both be shrivelled
up in some British quarrel; and it wants good
liquor, lest the rising nation should be poisoned
before it has time to realise any of the advan-
tages of independence ; and it also wants educa
tion and One-man-one-vote, so that it may b<
able to prevent the resurrection of monopoly ir
future days; and decentralisation, and th
abolition of Chinamen, and other things a i
well. But it doesn’t want to live on any single
dogma, and the Foreign-traders, and Single-tax
faddists who preach Land Nationalisation as a
doctrine by itself, and the other men who
preach teetotalism or republicanism or Protec-
tion as the whole duty of man, are a joint-stock
delusion and a snare. “One man one fad ”is a
ruinous doctrine.
Sample of loyalism from an article on “ Wales”
in the Review of Reviews :
In these last days many men have talked glibly about a
republic. Such words are lightly spoken, but those who
utter them have little weighed their significance. No
such breach in the historical continuity of our Constitu-
tion should be spoken of save with hated breath as men
speak of a possible catastrophe—which may Heaven in
mercy avert. . . . Until a republic has been created
which ventures to elect a female President any subversion
of the monarchy would be a disaster to progress. It
would be better—much better —to confine the succession
to women. We have always done well under female
sovereigns.
The moral seems to be that the great advantage
of royalty is “continuity.” Continuity is the
virtue of hanging out a desperately long time ;
it also implies extreme length, after the manner
of a snake, or a bill of costs, or a protracted
lagoon, or anything else that lias a great area
of remoteness between its head and its tail. A
chronic bore, a dynasty, an hereditary disease,
and a sea-serpent are all continuous, and so is
the interest .charged at Ike pawnshop. Taking
it all round, continuity seems a cloubttul virtue,
and the idea of a line of female sovereigns is
still more doubtful. If the males of a royal
family are all too scrofulous, stupid, and
obnoxious to be trusted in a public billet, their
mothers and daughters must be a desperately
shady lot. England lias speculated in four of
them, anyhow ; and one of them burned Pro-
testants, and another burned Catholics, and the
third was more dense than the ordinary cow,
and the fourth is a money-grubbing nonentity.
And if the country has done well “ under ”
them, they have all done remarkably well on
top of the country. For, however the corpse
underneath may prosper, the cabbage that
grows on top generally prospers a good deal
more.
A correspondent sends us some particulars
about a large New South Wales public company
which seems to have got the art of monopoly
down pretty fine. It employs about 300 miners,
and the works are situated in a lonely basin
among the bills, about 15 miles from anywhere.
The company runs its own grocery store,
butchery, bakery, and rum-shop, and charges a
stiff percentage above normal prices. The
trade, however, is a monopoly ; the bowelless
corporation owns the land for miles around, and
allows no honest competitor on its territory ;
consequently it does the whole business.
Their are no amusements in the place barring
the company’s rum-shop, which leads to lavish
drinking; and thanks to this and the manner
in which the agony is piled up in the matter
of prices the men soon fall into arrears. Then
they are required to sign an agreement whereby
their bills are deducted from their wages.
Presently they have no wages at all; they toil
incessantly, but the debts always keep a little
ahead, and life consists entirely of a weary
round of credit victuals and unpaid-for liquor.
They can’t go away, for they possess not a
single cent. They can’t strike, for they have no
money, and the instant they struck the supply
of provisions would stop. They can’t belong to
a trades-union, for in that case also the supply
of food would be knocked off". They are hope-
less exiles, like those of Siberia or Sagbalien ;
and unless some revolutionary force rushes their
valley some day, and destroys the bills, and
sacks the store and the bakery and the grog-
shop, the situation seems incurable. It is the
same old story. The monopolist is the same kind
of monopolist in all lands and in all ages. He is
a nigger-driver, with a Bible in one hand and
his overgrown stomach in the other, and all he
wants is a fair show.
The Bulletin recently referred to the present
Australian police “ move-on ” system so far as
released prisoners are concerned. Says Com-
missioner Petekswalo (S.A.) in his last
report:—
Influx of Criminals.
1 am sorry to say that we are still having a large
addition to our criminal population from the eastern
colonies, to check which I have been obliged to put in
force the Convicts Prevention Act, No. 140, of 1879, by
which any person found in this colony within three years
from the date of the expiration of a sentence which he
has served in any other colony is liable to be imprisoned
for two years. This Act, which is also in force in Victoria,
is liberally acted on there and necessitates an equal
strictness here.
Now that S. Australia cries “move-on ” what
are the helpless unfortunates to do ? Either
starve or relapse into crime ! The police are
ever behind them, and the gaol-door yawns
ahead.

846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney, Sept. 2,1891.
My Dear Moorabinda,—
The first vice-regal flight into the regions of amateur
theatricals occurred on 27th ult. on a very realistic stage
erected in the red drawing-room, the rest of which, with
the ball-room, was crowded with a full-dress throng. As
there wasn’t one candid gallery boy present, the applause
was uninterrupted—and though unqualified rapture at
the performance of the purely Government House troupe
was only to be expected, still it is soothing to know that
everything really went off very well. The curtain-raiser
was a Fairy tale, “Creatures of Impulse,” in which the
olive-branches of the house of Jersey cavorted with con-
siderable aplomb—the younsrest daughter looking very
pretty and fairylike, after which came “ Little Toddle-
kins,” w'herein Secretary Goschen as a bouncing, golden-
wigged damsel in a turkey-red skirt and jacket over a
blue blouse, small, perched sailor hat and ecru parasol
and fan, was very near to nature-on-a-public-holiday ; his
love-passages with Chumley, at the finish, let the curtain
down to shrieks of laughter from the guests, who then
dispersed in search of the refreshment buffet. The dress-
ing was sui generis, Lady J ersey (who acted as promptness
to the players and did not appear till “all was ended
comme il faut”) wore ivory-white silk draped with black
lace ; Mrs. Fitzgerald (a guest at Government House), a
very fetching black lace and silk costume ; and another
striking costume was a black silk gown, the bodice
covered with white chiffon frills and puffed sleeves of
while chiffon to the knuckles—worn by Mrs. Yandeveere
Greene,
What surprises me most about the sassiety girl is the
artless way in which she attacks the affable Government
House youth with wreathed smiles and outstretched
hands, while that flattered five-feet-odd of old noblesse
suffers her onslaught with a calm resignation beautiful to
witness. Thu common sort of young man has to arrange
all the sorties himself and be torn with doubts as to
whether she is really going to speak to him or not, but
the weary vice-regal attache only screws his pane deeper
into his eye-socket, emits a surprised “haw,” and pre-
pares to receive cavalry. Only the other day a society
girl and a very pretty one, too—caught a flying aide-de-
camp by laying a tiny little gloved hand on his arm for
about ten seconds by Shrewsbury’s clock.
Ladies who go to England with pet nuisances, in the
shape of poodle dogs, in tow, ought to beware of the
second mate of a certain mail-steamer. On a recent
voyage out, he took a violent dislike to the four-legged
darling of one of the lady passengers, and one night, as
the cold stars twinkled and nobody was on deck save this
abandoned villain, ill-fated Toby, in all the splendour of
his velvet jacket, forged along the poop, wagging his
pampered tail. . . A horrible splash finishes the story
told by the ship’s doctor, who had Toby’s mistress on his
hands with hysterical fits for the rest of the journey I
In Sydney, by the way, the dog mania has given way to
the infant craze. Every girl who has a little sister gets
her up a la Kate Greenaway and sets her trotting down
the Block, and the amount of solid exercise dressable
infants get at present is enough to give them bow-legs.
It amuses me dreadfully sometimes—in ball-rooms and
dress-circles- to quiz the honest soul who won’t put on a
well-ventilated bodice for worlds, yet arrays herself in a
more flagrant manner than her V-shaped contemporary
dare do. I mean the woman who puts on a sleeveless
bodice in some dark colour, hacked down to the waist-
line fore and aft; under this she wears a pink-on-white,
tight-fitting bodice with sleeves (you must understand
there isn’t a bare inch of her showing !), and then she sits
in the front row with a smile of conscious virtue and half
the opera-glasses of the house focussed on her to see if it
really is what it looks like. And they don’t restrict the
originality of their devices to their jackets. At a big
dance the other evening there rotated a lady in black
gauze skirt with a frontal design of two long bands o
white-pink satin from hip to hem joining the curved pink
satin waistcoat at the top, with a strip of black tulle
betwixt. It was a splendid suggestion of what she might
have looked like as a pre-Adamite female clothed chrono-
logically.
Judged as a winter flower-show held on the verge of
spring the so-called “Camelia Show,” held in Sydney
Town Hall, on 26th ultimo., deserves nothing but praise,
though one cannot quite understand why the Horticul-
tural Society should rush a show along when flowers are
scarce and unreliable and the spring exhibition only a
few weeks ahead. The Governor, in a large hat attended
by Goschen in a small one, attended (for his part) by two
young ladies in feather boas, formally inaugurated the
floralities, but only about four people responded to the
appeal for three cheers for Lord Jersey, and the opening
was rather lame and impotent because Lady J. wasn’t
there. As a lady beside me remarked, “She expected to
see more kamraillas,” and so did I, but there were lots of
things to make up for them—the first prize decorated
table in pink roses and ferns, for instance, also the dis-
play of indigenous flora—the latter only as a novelty,
mind you—because native flowers are too eccentric in
shape, colour, and scent, to be wortli gushing over. I
always seem to see in them Nature's excuse for the
colouring and texture of our women. The centre
bouquet, on the wild-flower table (sent per Mr. Goschen
with compliments to Lady Jersey), was as neatly arranged
as such a collection of bristles and spikes could ever hope
to be, but it wasn’t quite fair to stud it over with English
buttercups.
The crowd at the Camelia Show was largely feminine.
The most charming woman there was Olga Nethersole,
rather tragically goltcn-up in a black visile, edged with
black feathers, and a littic, lid shaped black bonnet on
her carefully-dressed locks, quite a relief from the usual
daylight professional, with its pink cheek gleaming
through the shrouding spotted fall. Miss Nethersole
wore no verraillion and no veil, and the result was some-
thing “chic.” But I didn’t like a mastic-coloured Tudor
cape, with a yoke studded with glass “ diamonds”—it
looked as if the wearer had taken a header into a broken-
bottle heap. '■
By the way, on the opening day of the show, at least
two well-known free feeders were put in for it unex-
pectedly. You see, an enterprising caterer had strung a
buffet across the vestibule, and these two ghouls thought
it was a delicate little committee attention and let them-
selves go according!}'. However, at the fourteenth spear-
ing of their little forks a waiter grasped the situation and
murmured “Tvvo-and-six, please,” and the ghouls rose up
with freezing dignity and expressed their disgust in
voices choked with custard-roll, and proudly paid the
reckoning with a scathing comment on the age of the
ham-sandwiches and a biting allusion to the tricks of
tradespeople in general.
The fair in aid of that praiseworthy institution, St.
Vincent’s Hospital, opened to bad business in the big
Town Hall (it didn’t look so big with all the draped stalls
about) on 31st ult., with Cardinal Moran in his red moire
polonaise (I hope he won’t excommunicate me if I hint
that it is getting a bit shiny on the shoulders) as chief
spokesman, seconded by Lord and Lady Jersey and ex-
Mayor Riley. Lady Jersey opened the Fair with a rather
florid oration, and rounded off with poetry, and was pain-
fully nervous during the ordeal, and Lord Jersey supple-
mented the “ Kyardinal’s ” deliberate statements with a
speech that the crowd took to be waggish because the
speaker grinned so all the time. After which the guber-
natorial party (with one exception) went round and
bought largely at every stall—Lord Jersey buying a num-
ber of books for the cadet guard laid on in the building,
and presenting them personally to the boys, who are
thus made to cherish loyal sentiments at a vice-regal
outlay of eighteenpence per head. Lady Jersey also
shopped largely, but a shaven lordling, though in the
gubernatorial suite, certainly didn’t follow it. In vain did
bewchus damsels (there were lots of pretty girls about,
too - especially two at the flower-stall in the centre, and a
grey-eyed, persuasive being who was pushing a cane
furniture lottery over the way) button-hole him at every
turn. Not a red cent would the lordling yield rip, giving
as his excuse that “ he had no money and couldn’t borrow
any.” Coming from another man this would savour of
evasion—but coming from a lordling “ in a situation” it
was probably just the bald, dreary G. Washington, after
all.
There were all sorts of things in the bazaar—a “fish-
pond,” a spinning-Jenny (there were two of those around
the fair when you come to think of it!) and the usual
jumble of odds and ends that make the residuum of such
exhibitions. Music there was—enough to deafen one—if
they keep it up, ear-trumpets at a shilling a time would
show a big dividend at the finish, I predict, but the
“ National Anthem,” softly sung by the Turners, Mrs.
Vandeveere-Greene and Rainford, was an artistic effort.
The crowd was moderately large on half-crown day and
appeared to be keeping its wardrobe dark for the Spring
meeting at Randwick, though one or two arrested the
eye. Lady Jersey (who isn’t too “ intellectual ”to eschew
a neat waist) sported steel-grey brocade with front of
grey chiffon, bonnet in black and gold ; Mrs. W. P.
Manning (Mayoress), in heliotrope with a circle design
in white, bonnet in black and gold ; Miss Stephen, in
cocoa-brown and old blue ; the Misses Halliday wore
tailor-made frocks; Mrs. F. B. Freehill, copper silk
covered with black Tosca net and jetted, collar ; Annis
Montague looked well, togged cap-a-pie, in French grey ;
Mrs. S. A. Moss, in black, braided in black, large, grey-
hat with ostrich feathers ; and Mrs. Vandeveere-Greene,
in a gown the colour of her name, sported some special
furs. Other people present were Judge Fawcett, Captain
Leigh, Captain “Chumley,” Dr. Do Lambert, Mr
Calvert, Mayor Manning and any number of priests,
who, oddly enough, didn’t seem a bit nonplussed at the
wiles of the lottery syrens.
Harking back to Sara—are all the little agonised
verselets (mostly commencing “ Ah 1 that we had never
met ”) which are sent to the papers to be “ kindly trans-
lated’’out of bad English into poetic French, going to
wing their way o\ er the stormy seas to Sara ? Else why
this w hyness? But this is the sort of rhyme that would
fit the case like a glove
A leading comedian—an adorer of the departed, almost-
forgotten Sara—was the victim of a heartless jokelet,
the other day, after she sailed. He received a little
scented billet signed “ Sara Bernhardt.” assuring him of
her warm regard, and hoping to meet him ere long in
Paris. This prize he showed all round, and probably wore
next his heart at off-times, until somebody sadly explained
that an ordinary Sydney solicitor had pieced the French
together, signature and all, and the truth was not in it.
Judging from all one sees and hears, the safest thing a
money-hunter can do if he doesn’t wish to face the
divorce-court sooner or later, is to snare a real heiress,
because a rich woman is usually far more closely wedded
to her “ establishment” than she is to her husband, whom
she, as a rule, merely regards as a necessary adjunct to he r
entourage. So no matter how blank a spec, he turns out
to be, his wife will put up with him, partly for the look of
the thing, and partly because radical changes cost hard
cash—and the opulent female in the nodding bonnet is
always very careful to get the right change for a sovereign.
The uncertain woman to marry is the woman who has a
reasonable income with which she foots her own
bills, who has not to coax her lord for the wherewithal to
revel in a Spring bonnet, but signs her own cheques and
complains about the cooking and generally figures as a
boarder in the husband’s home. Independence of this
kind acts, to the dazzling youths who And Platonics
rather paying, as pollen to the bee, and the consequences
are often absorbing reading to the general public. So I
say to all men, if you will marry money—marry your
millionairess—when you catch her.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
Sydney Liedertafel’s next shriek will be assisted by
forty-two boys’ voices, which have more unearthly music

Sydney Owls hyginxed on 10th ult. at Needs’ rooms,
and made quite a success of it. As M.’sO. the “Gold-
finch” and his companion bird found partners for every-
body, and the sixteen dances were supplemented by
extras leading to a small hours breaking-up.
The ball given by Mrs. Merewether to “warm’’the
barn like newly-built Australian clubhouse was a little
stiff, as lots of the members’ wives came from the country
and didn’t know the female relatives of the town members

were present and the supper was an inspiration.
Mayor and Mayoress Manning gave an invitation “at
home ” on 24th ult. in their rooms at Sydney Town Hail
with music as the draw of the evening. Annis Montague
(settled in Sydney as a teacher) was amongst the song-
sters, and Madame Kellcrmarm contributed a polonaise.

There was quite an Australian gathering at St. Jude’s
Church, South Kensington, London, on 30th June, on the
occasion of the marriage of Miss Mabel Hinny, younger
daughter of the late John Hinny, of Sydney, and niece of
Mr. “ Jemmy ” Johnson, the well-known Sydney solicitor.
The happy man was Dr. Mourilyan, of H.M.S. Immortahte.
The wedding was quite a show affair, and it was a subject
of general remark how very pretty all the Australian girls
looked, comparing more than favourably with their
English sisters. Amongst the Sydney people present
were Mrs. Thomas Mort, Mrs. C. T. Gedye, Mrs. Dalglish,
Miss de Lauret, Charley Lett and his pretty daughter,
Mrs. G. F. Want and her daughter, and last, but not
least, Lady Samuel, “ Our Ambassadress,” as she is now
called. Dr. Mourilyan, by the bye, is a cousin of Mourilyan,
of the Basilisk, who discovered the Northern harbour
which hears his name.

It has rained at every Central Cumberland

Was it not apart of the contract that the
heavy and cumbrous Sydney Post-office pillars
should, for the public convenience, be connected
by telephone with the fire and police-staticns ? If
it was, then why is it that these conditions have

Mr. Fred. Brock, the well-known Sydney
stock-agent, who shot away both his eyes and the
bridge of his nose in an attempt at suicide, has
died of brain-inflammation. On recovering con-
sciousness after entering hospital he said to the
surgeon : “I am sorry I made such a mull of it.”
It is just as well that poor Brock did not recover,
for the hideousness of his injuries was almost
unparalleled in civil surgical experience.
The Australian Workman (Sydney) has

party will never have a fa : r show until they get a
daily newspaper of their own, and in any case a
newspaper will do them more harm than good,
unless it be cleverly run and not starved in the
matter of funds.
A murderer named Schneider, at Vienna,
is in trouble for killing sixteen girls, all of
them named Maud. He seems to have had a
down on Maud, in a general way, and whenever
he met any girl of that name he slaughtered her,
and buried her mangled remains in a fore t.
What Maud had done to him is not stated, but
judging from the style in which he has been deal-
ing with her it would seem to be something pretty
bad. Schneider’s wife also helped him in pros-
pecting for Maud, but when the horrid remains
of that numerous and mangled maiden were dis-
covered, she suicided.
Things of this sort, heralding the final
crash, are now happening in Sydney every day.
A youiig woman goes into a “private bank ’ of
deposit, which owns much brass-plate and a high-
sounding name, and, producing a deposit-receipt
for £2OO, says to the cashier: “Please give me
the £2OO and interest.” Cashier looks at the
receipt ruefully, and replies with a certain amount
of pity in his tones ; “ I am very sorry to say that
I can’t do it.” “ Can’t do it!” exclaims the young
woman—“can’t do it! Then I must go to a
lawyer and make’you do it.” “ Look here,” says
the cashier, “I am not interested in this business
—I am merely a servant of the office. Take my
advice, accept £lOO now and re deposit the other
£lOO and interest for four mouths.” Finally she
acts upon his advice. Should she ever recover
her balance, it will be at the expense of the
savings of some other poor fool, deposited for the
purpose of getting high interest on no real security.
All this kind of thing reminds one of Mr.
“ Banner-Oakley,” of the Glasgow “Co-operative
Credit” Bank (interest, 18 per cent, per annum,
paid monthly), who was, some years ago, seized on
the wharf by the police as he was leaving with the
whole of the bank-assets in his carpet-bag.
Banner-Oakley got his deposits chiefly through
the persuasive eloquence of a hired lecturer. No
Sydney banker (Verb, sap.) has, up to date, been
enterprising enough to hire a lecturer. During
the triumphal progress round Scotland of Banner
Oakley’s stipendiary orator an old Scotchman one
night arose with the question : “ And, pray, how
does the banker propose to make over 18 per cent,
on his money so as to remunerate himself
for his trouble and re-pay the depositors, too?”
“ Ah,” replied the gifted lecturer, “Ican’t explain
that, but you may safely trust the matter to Mr.
Richard Banner-Oakley.”
Dear Bulletin, — I feel very tired when I
see in the Sydney morning papers every day that
Mr. Ednie-Brown, N.S.W. Director of Forests,
has proceeded to, or is about to proceed to, Hang-
man’s Elat to plant a tree, or to inspect some-
thing ; or that Mr. Ednie-Brown has been inspect-
ing the State forest at Mount Possum ; or that
Mr. J. Ednie-Brown has ordered that no more
trees be felled at Dingbat Gully. Is Mr. J.
Ednie-Brown doing all this for fun, or is a
grateful country paying him a decent screw
for it ? If so why is it necessary that we
should be made ill at breakfast-time every morn-
ing by reading that Mr. J. Ednie-Brown is doing
what he is well paid for doing? Why not let ns
all have a show : “ The energetic Mr. Muckrake,
attached to the Sydney Corporation, cleansed the
gutter in Bung-street early yesterday afternoon.
To-morrow he meets Mr. Napper by appointment
to break a heap of rocks.” And so on.— Billycan.
(There is a lot of difference between the cases of Mr
Ednie-Brown and Mr. Napper. Mr. Ednie-Brown is
somebody and is well paid, and Mr. Napper is nobody and
isn’t well paid, and it doesn’t do for a newspaper to notice
ill-paid nobodies. When State Railway-Commissioner
Eddy says lie is sick he is allowed by Government and the
newspapers a trip to Europe on full pay—£3ooo a year—
whereas when his subordinate, John Smith, the State
engine-greaser, falls sick he gets no pay and no leave—
except to go to the devil, so far as the Government
cares. State socialism is only recognised as regards the
top branches of the public services. - Ed. B.]

“ Sunset ” is a pretty little comedietta
constructed on similar lines to the author’s
“Barbara,” in that the story is chiefly un-
folded by the chatter of two girls, and that
the motive of the play is the sacrifice made
by the elder on behalf of the younger. The
renunciation in the case of Lois is that of a
prior claim to a fickle lover, while Barbara’s lay in
a failure to claim the name rightfully hers and the
property accompanying it. There is some real
jam in “ Sunset ” for those not past taking
interest in love-making. Some of Lois’ lines
are calculated to awaken tender reminiscences
in even the partially-petrified, and when
Joan, nicely played by Brenda Gibson, says,
in reference to hugging, that she “shouldn’t care
for a fellow who only talked about doing it,”
quite a sympathetic shudder went round among
the lightly-clad damsels of the dress-circle, while
the rustle of feminine apparel that floated up from
the stalls showed that the downstairs damsels
were similarly effected. filn Lois of Mary
Kingsley was very delicately handled, and her
pathos was very much truer than could have been
expected from the steely hardness of prior per-
formances. Arthur Greenaway played the seedy
young mash, whoso gloves have been cleaned and
whose boots haven’t, well, but somewhat too
earnestly. J. Cosgrove’s bumpkin lover,
Azariah Stodd, was a capital performance for so
young an actor, and “our Mary Ann” and
Harold Bussell were the stopgaps and lay
figures. Jerome’s house-warmer received a big
call on curtain-fall.

“ A Scrap of Paper ” is doubtless a lame
and impotent adaptation of Sardou’s play. It has
previously been played in Sydney by Wybert
Reeve, Genevieve Ward, the Majeronis and
Jeffreys-Lewis, and, so far as we can remember,
was no more successful on any of these occasions
than now. In the first place, it is not evident
that this particular scrap can in any way
benefit Colonel Blake, especially when, accord-
ing to his now-wedded sweetheart’s show-
ing, he must have received from her dozens
of similarly-worded communications, nor is it
apparent why, under these circumstances, the
lady should so regret its receipt by the presumably
honorable gentleman for whom it was originally
intended. Nor is the travelling gentleman’s
acumen made apparent, as the author seems to
think it is, in the place o: concealment chosen,
any more than is that of the prying lady who
discovers it with her “antennae.” Had he put
it away with his soiled linen, however, or between
the lining and sole of his slipper, or in his purse, or
worn it gummed to his chest as a porous-plaster,
of course, the play couldn’t have eventuated, and
so the author or adapter makes concealment
stupid and discovery easy. In a touch and go
light comedy character Charles Cartwright would
be excellent were he not so terribly noisy. His
defence of the civilisation of the Japs and Chows
might have been, as Bruce Smith phrases it,
“delivered from a tar-barrel in Sussex-street.”
Olga Nethersole, as Susan Hartley, has a part
that harmonises with her charming little affecta-
tions and mannerisms, while not calling on her for
any soul-harrowing “weeps,” therefore is she
thoroughly acceptable. Lawrence Cautley, hiding
his too fatal loveliness behind a tremendous beard
and yellow gaiters, was scarcely suited as a
sporting and uxorious husband, and Harold
Russell’s Doctor Penguin was chiefly remarkable
for a wonderfully good make-up. J. Cosgrove
was a particularly clumsy school-boy and other
small parts, mere “ feeders,” were ably handled by
Nellie Lyons, Mary Kingsley, Jenny Watt-
TantgT, Miss Melville, Constance Edwards, and
W. J. Beresford. The traveller’s room of the
second act disclosed a fine collection of skins,
shells, shields, spears, stuffed birds and beasts,
snakes, skulls, horns, and hides, the property of a
local collector, and Mr. Wilson is to be congratu-
lated on his conservatory scene of the last act.

Manager Macdonald is still reluctantly
turning away money from Sydney Her Majesty’s,
and “The Lights o’ London” apparently would
run payably for at least a month more than
prior engagements will allow. This is not sur-
prising, for it is very well-staged and carefully
handled. In the workhouse, frontcloth-scene, for
instance, every entering figure is a faithful picture
of some type, and the realistic manner in which
the wind whistles through George Rignold’s
moustache is enough to make the fattest man in
the warmest corner of the house shiver till his
bones rattle. Another piece of high-art realism
which appeals to every Sydneyites’ breast is the
manner in which the London policeman is induced
to wink at the exigencies of a “jug ” business in a
late locality, and for real sensationalism give us
George Rex’s leap into the icy waters, a deed of
daring only surpassed by his subsequent over-
throw of ten policemen. By the way, if some of
these blue-coated menials of parochial despotism
(are ye listenin’, E. W. O’Sullivan ?) are not well
padded they’ll get hurt some frosty evening.
Clint and Co.’s Regent Park scene with its
background of brightly-lit streets, middle-distance
bridge swiftly crossed and re-crossed by hansoms
and tree-lined canal-banks, does them credit.
The management have followed the Bernhardtian
example and omitted a scenic catalogue from

their programmes; this is a mistake. Some
hayseeds the other evening imagined that the
scene just spoken off must be laid in Venice simply
because it had a canal and a bridge or two of some
size. A mere lad, Master Thompson, plays a
street-Arab fairly well. So far George Rignold
and Sterling Whyte seem to have escaped in-
fluenza. Certainly, if you take a plunge-bath in
the evening, you don’t absolutely long for a
shower in the morning.

“ A Night Off” could nob have thoroughly
satisfied the “ gallery-boy with the dreadful
whistle,” for it was withdrawn on Saturday last,
the date when “Dr. Bill” re-commenced Sydney
practice for six nights only. It could scarcely be
expected that this constantly-retiring and con-
stantly-resurrected medico, who might be styled a
regular “ Bill ’’-sticker, would at once take up
the parable where it was dropped, and so busi-
ness, at the time of writing, has been scarcely up
to the standard required of a small theatre witli
a high salary list. Pattie Browne’s kneecap is
much better, thank you, and so she is back in her
old part of the high-kicking Pauntleroy. The
place of Brenda Gibson, engaged in playing at
the opposition house, is filled by Nannio Gallagher,
formerly on the list at the other place, and R se
Brandram plays Ellen. Otherwise, parts are dis-
tributed as before, and Hamilton Aide’s adapta-
tion of Albert Carre’s play will ably hold the fort
until Saturday night, when “Devotion,” now
running in Melbourne and the first of Dot Bouci-
cault’s plays to be staged in Sydney, will be
produced.

Old Elton has been playing William Guard
during the week at Sydney Royal to somewhat
diminished houses, though flagging interest was
temporarily revived by the re-appearance ofCharles
Ryley, who now sings with much apparent effort,
as Marcell. Julia Loel has also taken a rest and
given up Fraisette to Ida Osborne, who has not
been seen or heard in Sydney for an age. Every-
thing otherwise is lovely, and the ballet is a joy
for ever, whose loveliness increases, but, never-
theless, sinks into nothingness beside that of
Elton’s self-painted portrait as “ le hrav grande
militaire,” now shown in Ascherberg’s window
free of charge. It is said that “lolanthe” is
ready to jump into the breach at an hour’s notice
should biz. run down too low. The Opera Co.
.open at Adelaide Royal in “ The Gondoliers ” on
19th September.
** * *
“ Moths ” was staged on Monday night
last at Sydney Garrick for four nights. Those
who didn’t see the prior production at this house
may find pleasure in the present one ; those who
did see it will probably view this, the latest imper-
sonation of the Ouidaesque, as an unqualified pro-
vocative to rank blasphemy. Despite a sensible
curtailment of some of the Bulwerish flapdoodle in
which “ Moths ” abounds, long- “ waits ” spun out
the show till 11 o’clock on first night, and
the whole thing didn’t seem to hit any-
one very hard. Only three of the parts, those
played by Olga Nethersole, Laurence Cautley and
Charles Cartwright, are filled as they were pre-
viously. The little lady’s Vere, despite atr inten-
sified leaning towards gurgle and gasp, is marked
by all its old earnestness and suggestion of inno-
cence and purity. Cartwright has altered the
make-up of his Zouroff, and for the worse, other-
wise the performance is up to its former high
standard of excellence. Cautley’s tenor singer
Correze has also been changed in appearance.
Now, his locks are grey, and plastered down
exactly like the curly candle-wicks of Kyrle
Bellew, and the soulful gusher drags his
toes across the stage and wheels round on one
heel with his back to the audience after the
feather-legged-rooster, Irving - Bellew - Lyndal
fashion. Sass, as Lord Jura, is sorely missed.
Harold Kingsley is no juror or we’re no judge;
nevertheless, his overthrow of Zouroff, at Szarisla,
■was excellently managed. But the supreme
•blunder of all was lifting Nellie Lyons out of
Fuchsia Leach, a part that might have been built
.round her, and fitting it on Mary Kingsley, whom
lit touches nowhere, while the former’s Lady Dolly
iis just one whit less villainous. Jenny Wati-
Tanner looks too comfortably rotund and good-
matured for the vixenish Sonnaz, and “Con-
stance Edwards is just as feeble as any other
■ordinary amateur would be as Nadine. W. J.
Wilson’s Deauville garden-scene is very fine in-
deed, and the staging throughout is up to the
present high level prevailing in Sydney. But the
weary travellers who come in from the wintry
Russian steppes, looking warm and contented,
arrayed in spotless boots and bobtailed jackets,
don’t study the harmony of things. F. C.
Phillips’and Sydney Grundy’s “ Ambassador,” a
comedy-drama, goes up on Saturday night.

The Simonsen Opera Company are sailing
over the high C’s at Melbourne Alexandra on an
even keel, and the man on the look-out —viz.,
little Martin S. —sees no ominous signs of breakers
ahead. Business was satisfactory during four
nights of “tin Ballo,” a performance which
brought prima-donna Guidotti into increased
respect as an actress, whilst “Lucia,” produced
on Saturday night, proved the success of the
season thus far. That long-sustained struggle
'between singers and orchestra, at the end of the
second act, in which the big drum plays such an
appalling part, was received with a display of
■enthusiasm that caused the company to forget
their dramatic differences and shake hands all
'round, Edgardo, indeed, put his mental distress
im his pocket and smilingly insisted that the con-
ductor should take a call, whereupon the
‘dashing Maffezzoli turned round and pointed
with his baton to the region of his heart
® s the shilling pittites waved their hats.
■Somebody even made an attempt to strike
yp “He’s a jolly good fellow” in Italian,
but lus knowledge of the language broke down at
“jolly,” so the well-meant enterprise had to be
hastily abandoned. When the excitement sub-
sided the tenor and baritone relapsed into their
family feud and commenced to clash swords, and
later in the evening the bonnie Lucia went mad as
usual, but whatever happened always appeared to
be for the best, and all the leading characters
shook hands in the most cordial manner after a
few of them were dead. “ Lucia ” was probably
as great a triumph as can be attained in Italian
opera at popular prices. The Cutticas, husband
and wife, Sisco and lorio, shared honours with
the conductor and his forces in the lump. This
(Thursday) evening “Un Ballo” is given for the
last time, “Lucia” again on Friday, and “ Les
Huguenots ” on Saturday.
* * *
Elsewhere old bills have been renewed for
the present week. At the Royal, last Friday,
they revived “ Woodbarrow Farm ” for one night
only, because it is a sort of agricultural show in its
little way, and was considered to smack of green
pastures and “well-bred cattle, marching slow.”
The course of “A Celebrated Case” was con-
tinued on Saturday, and seemed, perhaps, a trifle
fresher for its night off. This drama, as already
mentioned, is crowded with opportunities for
strong acting. Nobody can bo said to rise to any
one of several splendid situations, although Miss
Villiers puts some skilful acrobatic business into
her death-struggle in the first act. Of the others,
Miss Floyd is the most absolutely helpless when
the pinch comes, whilst little Violet Ashton (or
Baby Nichols) sets a good example to xhe whole
crowd. Boothmau, who represents the local
element in Miss Villiers’company, seems to have
been thrown in for the purpose of challenging
comparison between English tweedledum and
Australian tvveedle-dee. Boothman, however,
proves nothing except that two blacks don’t
make a white, and if it would soothe the manage-
ment to hear that this artist is an additional source
of sadness to the looker on, why the management
can accept the statement as read. “ Lost in
London ” will be put up on Saturday (sth).
“ Devotion ’ has done moderately well at
the Bijou, notwithstanding the uncanny cut of
several pairs of silk pantaloons and a superabund-
ance of false hair. Playgoers, though, are about
full up of the Richelieu period, and tired of hear-
ing that His Majesty the King is in the next
room ; moreover, respect for court suits and all
royal institutions is on the rapid decline. Bouoi-
caults little play is a clever, showy, stagey
production which never appeals to the heart, or
persuades one that it is dealing in facts ; conse-
quently, Melbourne will
not miss LyndaTs legs
very much when the pre-
sent company depart for
Sydney to make room for
the Brough contingent
and “Jane” on Satur-
day.

Gaiety burlesque
prospers more than ever,
at Melbourne Princess’,
and the bitter cry of the
stonebroke johnnie will
probably be heard in our
midst anon. “ Cinder-
Ellen ” is considered
funnier, at time of writ-
ing, than it was on the
opening night, that is to
say, there is much less of
it. Ere these beautiful
lines appear in print the
plot may have changed
again for the better, and
many of the songs are
certain to be different,
because the same songs
would pall dreadfully
upon a johnnieifhehad to
hear, ’em six nights in suc-
cession and wasn’t too
drunk tounderstand. The
one really novel feature
of “ Cinder - Ellen ” is
Nellie Barren as a girl. She takes very kindly to
petticoats after all these long years of performing
in the other things, and appears to have made a
fresh start in life at the age of fifteen :
A song that Nellie sings in the schoolroom scene
is droll enough for anything. Fred. Leslie keeps
his end of the business up all the time, but pretty
Grace Pedley, Danby, Fred. Storey, and the
dancing girls are somewhat merged in a multitude
of chorus. The three fair amazons strike atti-
tudes in the front row as of yore, but they do
nothing else worth mentioning, and are generally
regarded as monotonous. “ Cinder Ellen ”
abounds in strokes of Leslie’s mechanical humour
and suggests, even more than “Ruy Bias,” that
he could arrange a harlequinade better than any
comedian on the stage. But it is to be hoped he
will not do anything so dreadful. The Gaiety
season will be followed on September 12 by “ The
Late Lamented,” a farcical comedy, in which
Snazelle makes his first appearance at the Princess’.

J, L. Sullivan leaves the Opera House
this week, and the question of what entertainment
would follow the discarded slogger was a hopeless
mystery, seemingly, at the time of posting this

At the Athenreum critical exception is
taken to some of the figures in Snazelle’s views,
and people complain that the Village Blacksmith
is a different outrage upon humanity in each pic-
ture. But the recitations, songs, and yarns get
there all the same, and a vice-regal command on
the subject has been issued, A view of Hopetoun
commanding Snazelle would look very nice on the
sheet.

The Gaiety Hall was packed tight on
Saturday, and the Waxworks had a great time
during the Agricultural Show. In the course of
scouring the market for novelties Phil. Stuart has
secui'ed, at enormous cost, a pair of prize twin

Nature’s font, to the music of a brass band.

Alfred Dampier’s Co. is doing good gallery
business at Adelaide Royal. “Shamus O’Brien,”
“IP's Natural Life,” “Miner’s Right,” and other
dramas of this description have followed in rapid
succession. The members of the company have
shown excellent results with the material at hand.
Janet Achurch, Charles Charrington and Herbert
Flemming put in four successful nights at the
Albert Hall to fill up time before departure for
West Australia. One evening was devoted to the
production for the first time in this country of
Henrik Ibsen’s “Hedda Gabler,” a weird, mys-
terious piece thoroughly characteristic of the
author. Tanner fasts away and Tommy Hudson
has returned to his old love, Garner’s theatre.
Dear Nellie, some ten thousand nights
You reigned supreme in silken tights
A thing of beauty and a joy
Forever seemed you—as a boy.
But now, in wealth of golden curls,
You figure as a queen of girls;
Old Time he winks his other eye
When Cinder Ellen capers by,
And with a wheezy laugh asserts—
“ Begad ! she’s born again—in skirts.”

One of the ladies of the Laura Villiers company gives

Johnel Sullivan insists upon being served with a hot
roast of meat at his Melbourne hostelry, after the drammer
is over. On at least one occasion he has started proceed-
ings by sweeping his repast off the supper-table with his
strong right arm. Probably the Slugger considered that
the times were out of joint.
Lucia Harwood recently gave a mixed matinee enter-
tainment at the Steinway Hall, London. Lucia seems to
have produced a brother who shared a duologue with her,
and a little sister Dorothy who gave clever recitations.
Robert Reece, the burlesque writer, is dead. His work
was better than Farnie’s, about as good as Burnand’s, and
many degrees below H. J. Byron’s.
An advertisement biography of a damsel calling herself
the Queen of American Dialect Readers states that “ she
eventually'enteredaconvent, where she speedilydeveloped
signs of unusual dramatic ability.” Which is more re-
markable than the instance of an Australian bard whose
genius burst into bloom in an ironmongery 7 establishment.
One of the most impromptu performances on record
was given in a certain Australasian city the other week.
The managers of a travelling show had abandoned a
sterile season in despair, and were mingling groans over
the decline of the drama when their weary eyes fell upon
a small crowd of patrons waiting outside the doors of the
deserted “house.” No management likes to turn away
good money, more especially from bare benches, so these
managers rushed round to the back, lighted the gas, and
re-opened the show with a new and special attraction for
one night only. Within half-an-hour they had rallied
their company round the standard, and started a brilliant
rendering of “ Our Boys ”on go-as-you-please lines. The
performance was a splendid financial success. One act of
Byron’s comedy sufficed to send the audience away en
viasse, after which the company cheerfully divided the
takings and withdrew likewise. It subsequently trans-
pired that two of the leading characters thought they
were taking parts in “East Lynne,” and the audience
held an indignation meeting round the corner to protest
against any further representation of “Hamlet” without
the ghost.
Laura Villiers, who complains that she has come all
these thousands of miles “ to be made feel so wretched,”
is apt to forget how many other people have been made
wretched likewise.

Slade Murray left (with Ada Marven’s company) for India
last week. “Good old Mary Ann” has had a pros-
perous business time in Australia. Apropos, music-hall
singers are a source of delight to the ring, who really

A few years ago, an Italian gentleman was running a
company in Queensland, and had good luck all down the
coast till he reached Brisbane. There he struck a great
financial snag. There were about four people in the
circle, and two in the stalls, and they made up a very un-
appreciative half-dozen ; also, there were some forty soul-
less clods in the pit. The Signor stood this for three
nights, and then he struck ; in other words, he got tight
and made an oration. “ Laidees an’ shenteelmen, I bring
my opeer-a companee from Singapora, Batavia, Cookev’-
town, Eockyhampytown to Brisban. We playee ‘La
Favorita,’ ‘II Trovatore,’ ‘La Traviata,’ anyding. You
canno’ appreciate it, you can go to what-yoii-call blazes.
Exycuse me, I canno’ speak very good Anglaishe.” Then
he bowed and retired.
When Irving studied Shylock, he had recourse to a
Jewish friend, who told him that the Keans, Phelps,
Brooke, and all the other actors, did the curse wrongly’
because a Jew will never kneel to curse, but stand, with
his hand on his brow. At night, Hebrew attorney, in
the stalls, said, “Well, I didn’t know Irving was one
of us.”

Amateur male leg-shows—in place of amateur theatricals
—are the latest thing now in the best American society,
The biggest show of this kind that has yet come off was a
“ charitable entertainment ” at the Garden Theatre, New
York, when Mr. Thomas Kelly, the premiere danseuse of
that city, and Mr. Charles Frazier, the premiere dansevs /
of Philadelphia, furore.” The poor, washed-
out New York dude was clean shaven, and the local press
grovels about his “ lovely rose silk gown festooned with
graceful garlands, and with diamonds glittering here and
there in the corsage.” His frock was cut low at the front,
showing a considerable section of his flat, unlovely trunk,
and his alabaster shoulders caused a pleasurable" excite-
ment; also his back was in fashion, and pre-
sented a fair mark for a kick, if his mentally diseased
audience had possessed vigour enough to give it. The
assemblage also approved of Mr. Frazier’s arms which
were white and delicately' rounded, and taking him all
over he was a soft and dainty creature, with a kissable
expression upon his rosebud mug. Nobody walloped this
pair or had them arrested. Nobody even had enough
mental vigour left to realise that the show wasn’t up to
much. The cultured and wealthy American of the new
generation is a faint, scented, mcrally-decayed creature,
who wails over the hardship of his lot if a fly settles on
his umbrella. He is made up mostly of uncounted gold,
indecent fads, and mixed drinks, and he isn’t, stricA/
speaking, either a man ora woman—heisonlya “cholly,
or a “chappie,” or some other kind of dude according to
the fashion of the moment. And if Washington could
see him it would make that dead patriot almost wish that
he had never had any Revolution at all.

London Echo : “ Every person who cannot
work must be cared for without degradation, and
every person who can work must be put in the
way of finding the work he can do. That is a big
order, but it spells civilisation. If Government
means anything but backing up the strong, it
ought to mean that. In the congested regions of
wealth we must find part of the remedy for the
congested regions of poverty.”
Premier Munro’s private secretary, Ebe-
nezer Thomas, is at war with the Premier s
orderly on the subject of a black bag. The secre-
tary instructed the orderly (a trooper) to carry the
Premier’s bag between the railway-station and
the department, whereupon the orderly said he
was not going to fetch and carry for anybody
after working hours. Then the Chief Commis-
sioner of Police transferred the orderly and pre-
vented a split in the Cabinet. Moral—Never

“We must be in port,” said one of the

of the man who, while struggling in the water on
the same dark and fateful night, buoyed up, as he
thought, his wife. When they were taken into
the boat he found the rescued one to be not his
wife (to whom he had been but five months
married), but another woman. On two previous
occasions we have seen such incidents recorded in
connection with wrecks, and Emile Souvestre has
evolved from the situation a powerful short story.

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Arthur Western had just been married. His
bride was changing the for-ever-after useless robe
which it is customary for women to wear on such
occasions, for her travelling dress, and he had
managed to detach himself from the crowd of
guests thronging his father-in-law’s residence, and
was congratulating himself upon having so adroitly
escaped from the torture of ceremony.
“ A good opportunity to read that letter of
Eclie’s,” he muttered, then added with a smile,
“How offended and indignant she would be, it
she knew I had a letter of hers three hours in my
pocket without attenuating to open it. bhe is a
little huffy, I suspect, at not having been apprised
of my intention till the last moment, but magnani-
mously forgives me and sends sisterly congratula-
tions on this happy event.”
Somehow the word “ happy ” sounded as if the
speaker doubted its aptness.
Soliloquising on its contents he opened the letter
he had taken from his pocket, remarking as he
glanced at its. date that it had been delayed a
couple of days by the floods. The letter ran
thus: —
My Dear Arthur,—I presume you had some good reason
for keeping me in ignorance of your matrimonial inten-
tions till they have almost been consummated, though 1
am unable to imagine w hat your reason can be.
Perhaps you guessed what my feelings would be ou
hearing that you were going to marry one woman, know-
ing as 1 do that you love another. For that you still
love Ethel Herbert I am convinced. If you marry anyone
but her I shall be more disappointed in you than 1 ever
was before in any human being. Thank Heaven this
letter will be in time to prevent you committing the act
of a madman. Weigh carefully what I have to tell you.
You remember that evening on which you came home
from Randwick races and told us that you had lost ±700,
and that as there was no possible chance of your being
able to find such a sum there was nothing for it but to
make yoursilt “scarce.” Well, I am an
inexperienced fool knowing nothing of the
ways in which men manage to tide over
such difficulties. I have conjured up
dreadful ghostlike pictures of the
brother I loved hiding from his
creditors and the police.
I felt as if I should go mad,
and at last resolved to un-
burden my mind to my one
friend and confidante, Ethel
Vincent. I told her every-
thing. Poor girl! I know
now that my agony of mind
was as nothing compared to
hers, though at the time the
selfishness of my own grief
prevented me from seeing any-
thing of hers. She walked
home with me, assuring me
that everything would come
r'ght, and that a day some-
times brought forth wonderful
things. That day, or rather night,
did. Next morning a parcel was
handed in for you by a man whom the
servant said she had never seen before. It
contained £700 in notes, together with a
tc apof paper,which merely said—
“ In case what is intended as a gift should,
as such, burden the mind of the recipient, it can, when-
ever convenient (the sender prays not bcjore ), be placed
with Messrs. Wynne and Wynne to the credit of Gustavus
Smith.”
W r e tried for hours to guess who could have sent you
such timely assistance. .
Three days afterwards Ethel Vincent was married to
that rich old Herbert whose admiration for her we had
always treated as a joke, and whose importunities had
always seemed to cause her so much worry and annoy-
ance. I knew then who had sent the £700, Ethel had
sold herself to get the money for you ! It was one of
those actions which find nothing but condemnation in the
minds of your goody-goodies with their everlasting cant
of thought and speech, but I am wicked and romantic
and stupid enough to look upon it as a grand sacrifice,
grandly made by a woman for the man whom she loved.
I went to her, and with a sorrow that was largely
alloyed by my relief at the result of her action, told her
I had guessed her secret. The manner in which she
received my communication awed me as nothing ever did
before or since. She made me solemnly promise never to
divulge what I knew. f have faithfully kept that
promise till now, though I found it hard to do so at times
when you spoke so slightingly of Ethel and her falseness
to you. ,
Six weeks ago Mr. Herbert died—m his wife s arms,
adoring her to the last, I am told. Ethel is free. She
still loves you, for such women love but one man. I can-
not believe that the love which was so strong within yen
two years ago is dead already—nay, I believe that if you
were to be married a dozen times over yon would still
love Ethel. I suppose I have done a most culpable and
dishonourable thing in thus breaking my promise, but
ob ! Arthur, I could not let you wreck your life and
Ethel’s when speaking might prevent it.
I was so upset by the announcement of your intended
marriage that I should have set out for Wurra Wurra at
once, hut, thanks to that wretched buggy accident, I am
still a cripple. However, this will reach you on the 13th ;
the contemplated marriage is fixed for the 15th. You will
have time to devise some way of getting over it. 1 am
truly sorry for your fiancee, but I am inclined to think it
will not take her a lifetime to get over her disappoint-
ment, since it is just three months since her engagement
to Mr. Cole was broken off.
Think of Ethel, Arthur ! Anxiously waiting to hear the
steps which you have taken. Your loving sister,
Eire.
There fell on the summer air u cry which racked
and tore a strong man's frame in its passage from
heart to lips.
Chapter II.
At the side of a tiny lagoon nestling at the foot
of the hill on which stood her house, Ethel Her-
bert stood one evening watching the water-liens
playing with their young. She was too absorbed
in thought to notice the horseman entering the
gate behind her. But he saw the solitary form
standing by the lake and recognised it. He dis-
mounted and went up to her.
“ Ethel, I have been struggling for months
against the wish to come and see you. I could
hold out no longer. ’
The woman so greeted looked dumbly at the
speaker for a moment, then, though her heart
throbbed painfully, said in a cold, calm voice—
“ It’s kind of you to come and see me.”
The formality of her manner made Arthur
Western shiver. For a moment he paused irre-
solute ; then, ere she could divine his intention
made a sudden step towards her and took her in
his arms as he said, “ I can no longer be deceived
by your acting. Edie has told you that I know
all. My darling, my darling, can you ever for-
give me for being such a blind, mistaken fool?”
Perhaps a woman is never so entirely subjugated
by love as when she finds that, allied to the
strength of her lover, is a daring which bewilders,
half frightens, but wholly enthralls her.
Her mask of reserve was torn off ; her armour of
cold formality dropped into a thousand pieces at
her feet; and the woman who, through months of
wretchedness, had proved herself patient in suf-
fering, strong in endurance, sobbed in her lover’s
arms like an over-wrought child. Something of
triumph mingled with the love on Arthur
Western’s face as he softly stroked her hair and
soothed her with the words that come so readily
to the lips when love is in the heart, and the
beloved in the arms of the speaker.
The storm raged itself out. Ethel at last raised
her head, and said in unsteady tones :
“ You must not stay. Please go, Arthur !”
“ Yes, yes, darling, when you have said when I
may come back. What would our lives be worth
to us, Ethel, if we had to spend them apart ?”
He had resisted her efforts to get free. His
arms were still around her. His every word
sounded like a caress.
“ What else can we do ?” she said, miserably.
He held her yet more closely as he whispered :
“Do you, then, care so much for the world’s
opinion ?”
“ No,” she answered. “ Eor th.at I care nothing
—absolutely nothing. When a woman has for-
feited her own respect she cares little for that of
other people. It would be difficult for a woman
who has been the wife of a man for whom she has
no love, to reach any greater depth of degradation.
No, it is not that which I think of, but ’’—she
paused slightly—“if there were nothing else
tb°re is your wife. Think of her suffering.”
IT WOULDN’T FOLLOW.
TRAM-CONDUCTOR : “What have you got under your coat? An, a dog, I see.”
PASSENGER: “So it is.”
TRAM-CONDUCTOR : “You’ll have to put him outside. He must follow the car.”
PASSENGER: “ No, I won’t, my dog can’t run.”
(Tram stops and policeman enters.)
POLICEMAN : “ Why don’t you let your dog run? You know dogs aren’t allowed here.”
PASSENGER: “’Cause my dog can’t run.”
POLICEMAN: “ Show me the dog ! ”
PASSENGER : “There you are? I’ve just fetched him from the bird-stuffer's."
“ Her suffering!” he echoed disdainfully. “ Her
freedom is the only gift I could give her that
would evoke her gratitude. She married me out
of pique. Her lover has returned to his allegiance.
She would welcome the opportunity to fly to his
arms. So much for that scruple. Dearest, you
arc mine, mine !” he cried, with passionate force,
“ and no one shall stand between us.”
“Yes,” she said despairingly, “there is one —
there always will be one! Oh, Arthur, listen.
The man whose name I bear was good to me with
a goodness indescribable. My coldness and in-
difference, which, try as I would, I could not help
showing, must have been maddening, but his
gentle forbearance never once faltered. There
were times when another man would have felt
tempted to kill me, but he uttered ro word of
reproach. I sometimes think I broke his heart.
He treated me with the same considerate goodness
to the last —to the last he even loved me. He
died blessing me.” Her voice grew firmer: “I
care nothing for the world’s opinion, but he did.
He cherished the traditions of an old and proud
family. He held the honour of his name above
all tilings. I, on whom he lavished all the love
and generosity of a great, noble heart, will do
nothing to stain the name he held so sacred.” Her
tone changed from one of proud decision to one of
passionate pleading : “ Arthur, if indeed you care
for me, cease to tempt me and go. ”
He stood for a moment at her decree, then the
selfishness of the lover was overmastered by the
more generous feelings of the man. He bared his
Lonfl an 1 bonding reverently towards her in the
dusk, said:—
“ I, for whom you have sacrificed so much, may
well spare you the sacrifice of your loyalty to the
Dead—aye, even though to leave you kill me !”
She lay passive in his arms while ho pressed
upon her lips his kisses of farewell. Presently he
put her from him saying, hoarsely
“Co, for God’s sake, while I am able to let
you !”
She turned away without a word.
A step brought him to her side again.
“ I must help you up the hill.”
“ No,” she said, “ I will go alone.”
And all her life after it seemed to her as if, with
the same numb feeling at her heart and the same
shaking limbs, she was walking up-hill— a’ono.

A Melbourne weekly is very rough on

The Russians pounce on India again, this
time boring away from the Pamir, N.E. of

of the defended Kbyber and Bolan Passes.

wants Government to station men at the
backblock wells and watering places all the yea
round, whose duty it would be to fire off a gun a
sundown daily so that weary travellers might
know where to find water.
The S. M. Herald the other day stated
in a leading article that at the end of the century
the world could proudly say that during the last
100 years “it had cherished no delusion.” In the
same issue appeared a cablegram stating that
hundreds of thousands were flocking to the Holy
Coat of Treves.
W. Gr. Higgs, whose Parliamentary candi-
dature for South Sydney has been attended by
more snarling than any election on record, has
' entered a libel suit against the Australian Star.
Damages claimed, £2OOO. The Star, by the way,
goes to the Privy Council in re its libel-suit with
the E. News. The law-costs in this affair threaten
to pile up thousands.
The public should be cautious of the tonic
medicines they take, as many contain combina-
tions of strychnine, tannic acid, &c. Marshall’s
Tonic Nervine, however, is absolutely free from
any injurious drugs, and also pleasant to take.
“Journalist” writes; “While green at
this business, in Melbourne, judge of my astonish-
ment when the principal leader-writer on my
paper went straight over to the opposition paper,
which he had been abusing up and down, in
leaders, for six months, the object being evidently
to open a breach for himself. Dickens writes of
the feelings of Mr. Pickwick, when he saw Ids
barrister shake hands with Mrs. Bardell’s, but one
soon gets over that kind of thing.”
The Melbourne Post-office clock joke dies
hard. Smith, M.L.A., has been asking the
P.M.C. to issue a diagram or key to the expensive
toy, on the assumption that passers-by are unable
to tell the time o’ day by a dial on which the
ordinary Roman numerals are represented by
plain electrically lighted disks. Yet the clock, as
it stands, can be read by any ordinary child, so
Smith’s alleged inability to take in the situation
at a glance will come under the head of Parlia-
mentary Intelligence, and excite no interest.

“Caesar’s Column.’*
THE BOOK OF THE HOUR.
Ignatius Donnelly has for a season ceased to
speculate on sunken continents or wandering
comets. He no longer wiles away a cultured
leisure in reconstructing a prehistoric earth ; the
famous cryptogram lias been shelved for a season,
and the big-brained reconstructive scientific critic
of the past takes a long leap into the future, and
paints, with pigments made of humanity’s heart’s-
blood, a picture of the days to be. He does not,
like Bellamy, give us a social paradise of dead-
level industrialism, nor, like William Morris, a
retrogressive heaven of communistic happiness.
Writing under the name of Edmund Boisgilbert,
M.D., Donnelly attempts to give the results of
what he considers to be, a hundred years hence, a
logical development on present lines of nineteenth
century material civilisation.
* * #
“ Caesar’s Column ”is never feeble. It is often
fiercely powerful. In some passages it throbs
with a lyrical eloquence, in others it is passionately
denunciatory; but it never forgets its science or
its fidelity to the Darwinian theory of necessity
and development.
* # #
“ Christ was only possible in a bare-footed
world ; and the few who wore shoes murdered
him,” This is the key-note of Donnelly’s book.
Faith and civilisation are incompatible. New wo
iiave a choice. Now we may stop and take stock.
In a hundred years it will be too late! Given
existing conditions unchecked, and civilisation
must commit suicide. The book is luridly
fascinating. New York, the scene of the story, is
an earthly heaven, where man (or rather,
capitalism) has brought nature under foot, and
chained science to his car as a slave. Air-ships
scour the atmosphere. Electricity threads the
earth. Money is the only god, and human
brotherhood has perished from off the face of the
earth. One-seventh of the entire population riot
in soulless luxury. The great bulk of the people
lead and live the lives of brutes lower than the
beasts that perish. Then comes the inevitable
crash. Civilisation in the twentieth century
totters over the brink of Tophet, and falls into aii
abyss of chaotic Sheol, in which all art, science,
beauty and loveliness perish together. The
French Revolution is a child’s dream compared to
the horrors conjured up by the writer of “Caesar's
Column.” The outlook for humanity for
thousands of years afterwards is blacker than
midnight. To-day the ignorant mob triumphs
over the brutal plutocracy. To-morrow it will
starve. The day after it will devour its own flesh
and blood ; and civil government of the rudest
kind will take long, long centuries to reestablish
itself. Ignorance, passion, suspicion, brutality,
cruninality, will stand as 'lions in the path of
Humanity’s progress:—
Men who have such dreadful memories of labour can
scarcely be forced back into it. After about three-fourtbs
of the human family have died of hunger, or been killed,
the remainder, constituting, by the law of the survival cf
the fittest, the most powerful and brutal, wi.l find it
necessary, for self-defence against each other, to fonn
squads or gangs. The greatest lighter in each of tluse
will become chief, as among all savages. Then the history
of the world will be slowly repeated, A bold rutllan will
conquer a number of the adjacent squads, and become a
king. Gradually, and in its rudest forms, labour will begin
again; at first exercised principally by slaves. Men will
exchange liberty for protection. After a century or two
a kind of commerce may arise. Then will follow other
centuries of wars, between provinces or nations. A new
aristocracy will spring up. Culture will lift its head. A
great power, like Home in the old world, may arise. Some
vast superstition may take possession of the world; and
Alfred, \ ictoriaand Washington maybe worshipped, as
Saturn, Juno, and Hercules were in the past; with,
perhaps, dreadful and bloody rites like those of the
Carthaginians and ancient Mexicans. And so, step by
step, mankind will re-enact the great human drama,
which begins always with a tragedy, runs through a
comedy, and terminates in a calastrophe.
Thus the great wheel of time turns for ever on,
and perfected humanity remains the idle vision of
a poet’s brain. The “ Caesar’s Column ” which
gives its name to the book is a grisly monument
reared to the insatiable genius of bloody revolt,
erected by a leader of “ The Brotherhood of
Destruction,” one Caesar Lomellini, a monster
bred by the remorseless civilisation which he is
born to overthrow. His trophy is a towering
column, piercing the sky, built of the slaughtered
bodies of those who represented the order of
things annihilated, the human bricks of the
destroyed edifice of a rotten social system. These
corpses are arranged within wooden frames, layer
upon circular layer, around a central core of
dynamite, so that the man who disturbs or
pulls down the ghastly pile will wreck the earth
for his pains. As each course is finished, cement
is poured over it, and the human tower ascends
another space into the blue sky. One of the con-
cluding scenes of this bloody revolt is powerfully
sketched. From a parapet the supposed writer
view’s an angry, surging mob approaching under
the darkness of night to an attack on a barricaded
mansion. Their march is heralded by shrieks and
wolfish howls, flames and smoke shoot through
the gloom and attend their blood-stained progress,
and high aloft in the fitful glare is to be seen,
carried upon along pole, the gory, freshly-severed
head of their erstwhile leader, Csesar Lomellini,
the brutal giant who commanded “The Brother-
hood of Destruction,” and whose column will
remain as a mortuary memorial of the death and
burial of modern civilisation.
At the recent Eton College cadet review a
shot was fired “by accident.” The German Em-
peror, however, alleges that he distinctly heard a
bullet whizz past him.
It is claimed, by a good authority, that out
of every 100 society men who gamble heavily three
cheat habitually, and out of every hundred women,
six don’t play a square game.
A clear head is indicative of good health and
regular habits. When the body is languid, and
the mind works sluggishly, Ayer’s Cathartic Pills
will assist in the recovery of physical buoyancy
and mental vigor.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The fourth party in the N.S. W. Assembly
—the tea-party ; the small tea-party.
It is nearly time the N.S. W, Government
parrot was taught some other word besides
“ ’ject!”
Premier Fysh, of Tasmania, now frankly
admits that Parkes’ visit to Tasmania was “ a
great disappointment.”
The Victorian Government decides to
shunt out all the police-officers and men over GO.
This involves £lO,OOO a year pensions.
G. H. Reid says that if N.S W. takes the
right to vote from those who live on charity, some
legislators will be awkwardly placed.
The, easy victory in the Victorian Legisla-
tive Assembly against plural-voting was chiefly
due to the fatal advocacy of the Argus.
A sign of the times is that Dealt in has
declared that “ right, time, and the majority ” ar e
in favour of the Victorian liquor-prohibitionists.
Under the S.A. First Offenders Act (now
throe years old), 20 phi-oners have been released
without punishment. Of these but two have been
rearrested.
The N.S.W. Civil Service Commission
recommended wholesale reforms in the Postal and
Telegraph Departments. Result, the dismissal of
one temporary officer !
Graham Berry has at last to “turn up’
the Victorian Agent-Generalship—-in favour of
Gillies. The Age of yore styled Berry “ the Run-
down Dingo”—and now he will return with his
tail between his legs.
S A. Women’s Franchise Bill has been
carried in the Conservative Legislative Council by
a good majority, only three voting against it.
Here is the milk in the cocanut, however. There
is a property qualification, and consequently all the
Tory legislators rushed the measure, posing for
the nonce as democrats.
G. R. Dibhs and Bruce Smith may often
he observed coquetting behind the “bar”—when
Parkes is not about. Parkes is in bad health
physically and politically, and both Dibbs and
Bruce Smith love to exercise power. A Smith-
Bibbs Cabinet is quite feasible in the present low
state of the political barometer.
Dear Bulletin, —Frank Cotton, M.P.,
sententiously says the rejection of Parkes’ “ward ”
system by the N.S.W. Assembly is one of those
votes no one can understand. Mr. Cotton, of
course, voted with Parkes and against the Labour
Party. The question is—Should not Mr. Cotton
be directed to his natural seat, right behind
Parkes’ coat-tails ?—E. A. R.
The national and unsectarian education
policy of South Australia is being tampered with
by the Legislative Council. A proposal for a
capitation grant of £1 per head has been tacked
on to the Free Education Bill. The Assembly,
however, is almost certain to reject the new
clauses. If this happens, it is quite probable the
Council will throw out the Bill.
At the last general election a majority of
the _S. A. legislators promised to support the
remission of the Customs duties on tea, sugar,
cocoa, coffee, and kerosene, so as to reduce the
taxation on the poorer classes. Now that the
matter is before the House, many of them are
looking about for excuses to back out on, so as to
guard the land from paying more.
An effort is being made by the W.A.
Government to induce emigration from the Crofter
Isles to that province. A trial shipment of 50
families has been arranged, and should these bo
satisfied with their prospects, a large influx of
population from the Isle of Lewis is expected. The
Government are prepared to lease farms to the
emigrants on exceptionally favourable terms.
Apropos of the Australian cruisers. W hen
Admiral Aslanbegoff, of the Russian cruisers, in-
vited Melbourne citizens to a trip round Hobson’s
bay, in his mkish Afrika, they could not help
noticing, on the cuddy table, Semmes’ “Recol-
lections of his Alabama Voyages,” Every Russian
war-vessel was supplied with a copy. But English
commerce will, in t : me of war, all fly to the
American flag.
In the Queensland Assembly the other
Glassey tried to get a definition of the law
f ro ' “Suppose,” he said, “I sent a telegram
to Charters Towers, saying that the Postmaster-
General was a miserable, narrow-minded, old
'('got —would that be libellous?” The Postmaster-
General ; “That would be personal.” Muffled
voice from a back bench: “It would be d cl
monotonous, too. ”
The Canadian census shows that Canada
, las > within the last ten years, lost a million people
W emigration to the United States. Too much
mponal grovel and too much of ‘‘ Old To-morrow ”
the things that are wrong with the Dominion.
The population of Canada apparently consists
now of 1,000,000 escaped American cashiers, and
about 3,000,000 dishonest Government contractors,
and there is no good in any of them.
The new edition of the N.S.W. Parlia-
Handbook, though a credit to the
printer, is no credit to the compilers. It is remark-
able for what it does not contain. In the hands
of an outsider it might have been made a valuable
work of reference. For example, why should it
not contain the standing rules qf. the. British
House of Commons, which are adopted by the first
standing* order of the N.S.W. Assembly?
Sir Robert Hamilton’s time as Governor
of Tasmania is to be extended 12 months or so to
fit into his pension date. Which, of course,
means he will not go out on foreign service again.
I fie English Government had to ship him off from
Ireland in consequence of his sympathy for
Ireland and the Irish, and because he was far too
popular there, and will probably refrain from
appointing him there again, for the same reason.
Napoleon I. is said —probably it isn’t true
—to have once published an edict, which ran
thus : “ It is hereby ordered that all misery shall
cease within 14 days.” Anyhow, that is just the
way the average liberal monarch or enlightened
aristocrat does start to put down misery. And
if anyone is found miserable after the expiration
of 14 days, he wants to hang that individual for
breaking the statute. William of Germany is a
reformer of just this pattern.
During the Federation debate in the Vic-
torian Assembly, Taylor, M.L.A., moved an
amendment whereby the members of the Federal
Legislature and the officials of theFederalGovern-
ment should swear obedience to the “reigning
sovereign ” (including the President of the coming
Republic), instead of to “Her Majesty the
A CONVENIENT MISUNDERSTANDING.
SHE [the tired mother of three ugly daughters, one or more of whom she has vainly hoped
he would propose to) : “ Charlie, dear, I must really ask you what your
intentions are?”
He (rising hurriedly to clear out) : “ Madam, I make it a rule never to have an
intrigue with a married woman.”
Queen ” (meaning the Queen and her heirs).
There were 31 members in the House that night;
four of them voted with Taylor, and the other 27
voted against him, and cursed him into the bar-
gain for Ids “disloyalty.”
Apropos the N.S.W. Assembly electors’
rights debate. When “ Dick ” Ireland, Q.C., in-
troduced the principle of shilling electors’ rights a
large number of single men were on the West
Melbourne roll, and were much troubled how to
preserve the “right” until needed. In this
emergency a local publican offered the use of his
cash-box, and in it some three or four hundred
“rights” lay snugly by until needed at a general
scrimmage. The whole of the owners seldom
turned up at an election, but the “rights’’were
used all the same.
Parkes’ Electoral Bill is being radically
altered in committee. Already it has been
amended in three “ vital” parts ; and still Parkes
hangs on to his portfolio. He pockets the insults
—for the present, anyhow. One night he spread
a report that if the House did not stand by his
“ ward ” system, he would throw the Bill “under
the table.” The Labour-party rejected his stolen
fad, and he took care not to be in the House when
the division was taken. A message was sent to
Parkes that, if he did not sit up straight and drop
his bluff, he might be thrown “ under the table ”
in advance of his Bill.
Dear Bulletin, —If, as a correspondent
states, there be one traitor in the N.S.W. Labour
Party who carries caucus news to the Ministerial-
ists, then there is at least’another who gives
similar intelligence to the Opposition, for they
get just as early information of what goes on at
the caucus meetings as do the other side. I don’t
think, however, that “traitor” is the term —
“ blabster ” would, perhaps, be more appropriate.
I imagine these breaches of confidence are due to
the leakage, or overflow, of frail or diminutive
vessels, incapable of retaining the great in quan-
tity, or the strong in quality—irresponsible beings
from whom secrets ooze as easily as perspiration in
warm weather.—Yours, Okoss-Benoheb.
Says the Duke of Argyll in a prolonged,
apology for his existence :
Capital is the storages of labour and is purely the work
of mind in the past and its great weapon in the future.
As usual, the question is here begged by the
assumption that “mind,” if not the exclusive
possession of monopoly, is, under all conditions,
exercised by its possessors solely on behalf of the
monopolist. As if men could not, and would not,
display as much forethought, economy, and
energy in the storage of past labour and its
employment in reproductive effort on behalf of
the community as they do now on behalf of an
employer who dearly sells them the privilege to
use their talents for his benefit.
The Electoral Bill is being dangled before
the N.S.W. Parliament in order that Parkes may
distract attention from the fiscal issue. At its
present rate of progress the Bill will not be ready
for the Council in many weeks ; the Seats Re-
distribution Bill will then provide six weeks’ work
for the Assembly; and while the latter Bill is
being revised in the Council Parkes will demand
his Estimates iciththe fiscal issue still sunk, and, if
need be, defy the Labour Party to raise that
awkward issue. The Estimates must be given as
the price of the Electoral Reform, or else Parkes
will ride for a fall, and those measures will go by
the board, one being useless without the other.
“Concessions in return for support” will be
Parkes’ trump card in December.
The Constitution of N.S.W. says a holder
of a Government billet is not eligible to be a
member of Parliament. Mr. Jacob Garrard held
‘ an office of profit under the Crown ” for some
months prior to his recent election. A Royal
Commissioner may draw tw'o guineas a sitting for
taking part in a political farce such as Parkes’
costly and fruitless Civil Service Commission ; in
the following week he may run for a vacant seat
in the Assembly ; and, if defeated in the contest,
he may resume his grip on the people's guineas on
his mere motion. The question is, whether Mr.
Garrard should not absolutely have resigned the
chairmanship of the Civil Service Commission—
not merely resigning his grip on the guineas for
the time—before he was nominated for Central
Cumberland ?
Here is a fair example of the irony of fate.
When Burgess was in office in Tasmania he fixed
up a large and healthy deficiency, and left it to
his successor to liquidate. The successor toiled
like a weary Trojan for four years, and nearly
broke his back and his heart over the job, but he
did it at last. He got up the first surplus that his
poor, tired little island had seen for a long, long
spell. He was proud of his surplus, and used to
sit up at night and chuckle over it; and then he
deposited it in Burgess’s bank, and the bank broke
and now he can’t get it out. He got Burgess’s
deficiency, and now Burgess has got his credit
balance; and on top of it all he lias got to raise a
lot more money, and lend it to the bank, in tin?
hope of smoothing things till he gets the first lot
back again. Truly this is a tough globe to live in.
It is looking more and more likely every
day that Parkes will fool the N.S.W. Labour-
party badly with his Representation of the People
Bill. No one can reasonably suppose that the old
man wants to abolish plural voting, and thus
break up the strength of the importer and the
Foreign-trade landlord, but he wants badly to
keep the Labour vote as long as possible. There-
fore, his Bill is so big and cumbersome that it may
not be half finished at the end of the session, and
all that time Parkes will be a tired martyr per-
spiring at the pump-handle in the cause of
democracy. He will look, in short, six times more
of a Labour member than the whole Labour-party
put together—but the results will be nil, owing to
unforeseen circumstances over which Parkes does
not want to have any control. At present the
wily Premier is making as much toil and row as
if he were a dray and four horses engaged in
humping one reel of cotton over a level road, and
when he falls down dead in the shafts it will be
the weight of that reel of cotton that did it.
G. D. Clark, M.L.A., lately “drew atten-
tion ” in N.S.W. Assembly to the fact that the
postmistress at Leichhardt (Sydney) has a husband
in the N.S.W. Railway department—the in-
tended inference being no doubt that that lady
should be sacked on the “one man one billet”
theory. G. D. Clark himself intends to stick to
his job as (stipendiary) editor of a teetotal publi-
cation as well as to his (stipendiary) legislative
profession, on the ground that he “doesn’t know
how long the latter affair may last. ” The Bulletin
doesn’t know either. Also, as man is mortal, the
Leichhardt postmistress doesn’t know how long her
husband may last. Moreover, if a woman is to
have a vote why shouldn’t she also have a situa-
tion? And where does the “one man one billet ”
come in if Clark is to have two billets, and two
other people are only to be allowed one between
them ? This seems like Clark having four times
as many billets as anybody else. The situation
seems to be something like this : (1) One man,
one job; (2) All men shall be free and equal;
(3) Borne men shall be a lot more equal than
others; (4) G. D. Clark shall be these men.
A SYDNEY JEWELLER’S.
In Pitt-street, at the corner of the new Imperial
Arcade, a jeweller’s shop has lately been opened,
the arrangement of which is such as to attract
attention and admiration. Messrs. Dahms &
Company, late of the King-street Arcade, are the
proprietors, and the new premises are creditable
alike to their enterprise and artistic taste. A
jeweller’s business, perhaps more than all others,
is one demanding the exercise of tasteful judg-
ment, because the staple commodity is necessarily
an artistic one, jewellery being, in most cases, more
an article of ornament than use. Good taste—the
capacity for determining that which most closely
approximates to the truly beautiful—is essential
to a good jeweller, for it is only by the
exercise of this quality that he can hope to
anticipate and minister to the aesthetic demands
of the public. To be able to successfully antici-
pate public demand in this respect, requires more
than ordinary judgment and perception, for it is
essential that there should be also a knowledge of
the direction in which the popular aesthetic faculty
is developing. Thus it is, then, that when looking
at the articles of jewellery so attractively dis-
played by Messrs. Dahms and Co., one under-
stands the secret of the rapid growth of this firm
from a position of comparative obscurity to that
of one of the leading jewellers—brooches, bracelets,
rings, pins, chains, bangles, earrings, all bearing
in the midst of their profusion the unmistakeable
evidence of cultivated taste and commercial
ability. Inside the shop, the handsome show-
cases and fittings, made of polished walnut, and
specially designed to suit the requirements of
their business, indicate the completeness of a well-
ordered business. On the shelves of the cases a
glittering display of electro-plate may be seen,
relieved here and there by the brighter tints of
coloured cut-glass bowls and dishes and the softer
hues of pearl-glass and Crown-Derby ware. In
the electro-plate window these goods repose on
rich-coloured velvet and plush, the tints of which
are evidently chosen to present an effective and
pleasing contrast. Table-casters, fruit-dishes,
berry-bowls, flower-stands, spirit-frames, ice-
pitchers, cups and goblets vie with each other in
soliciting admiration. In another window,
arranged for the display of marble-clocks, an
equally artistic picture is presented. Prettily-
draped shelves show intending purchasers how
the different clocks would look on their mantle-
pieces at home, and so enables them to
make a selection under advantageous circum-
stances. In the jewellery window the goods
are displayed on various tints of velvet
that their effect may be seen when worn
on the different coloured dress fabrics. Messrs.
Dahms and Company can be especially recom-
mended to intending purchasers, by reason of
the utility and beauty of their goods, from a
gold brooch or ring to a silver-mounted walking-
stick or gold match-box, and from a salt-cellar to
a tea and coffee service or punch-bowl. Their
stock is varied, extensive and well-assorted, and
the prices moderate. The partners, Mr. Dahms
and Mr. Rollason, conduct their business per-
sonally, and their object is evidently to secure in
each customer a permanent and continued patron,
and being assured of this, they will doubtless con-
tinue to be successful.

Rumour goes that the authorities at Hobart
did not succeed in obtaining the services of a
professional hangman to execute Cooley for the
Richmond murder. Old Solomon Blay is no
longer up to the work, so had to resign. The fix
got so serious on the morning of the execution that
there was nothing else for it bub to disguise the
Sheriff himself in black wig, painted face, and
spectacles, and let him perform, just once in a
way, the solemn duties of his dignified office.

In announcing Captain De Moleyns’ en-
gagement to Miss Wilson, a Victorian paper
remarks that the gallant Captain “ fell under the
signal disapproval of LordHopetoun while in Vic-
toria, and consequently gave up his post and
returned to England.” People don’t know so
much about that. All they seem quite sure of
is that De Moleyns fell under the signal disap-
proval of a man out Toorak way.

When Christie Murray says that Aus-
tralians are “ drunken ” he writes bosh. George
Augustus Sala, a much closer observer, gives it as
his opinion that the Australian youth is pro-
voking! y sober. When Murray spoke of drunken
Australians he probably meant drunken English-
men in Australia. Among D. C. M.’s pals in this
country were quite a large number of imported
people, each of whom sported a whisky-volcano on
each square inch of his countenance.

Some more of the troubles of him who
teaches the young idea how to shoot. A N.S.W.
country teacher writes in a pathetic strain to tell
us how he gave a scrap-book as a prize to a small
girl in his class. Next day the recipient’s mother
sent it back with an indignant intimation that she
didn’t care for a book of blank paper, and that as
he had already cut out and appropriated half the
leaves he might keep the boards as well. Truly
it is heavy shovelling to be a back-blocks in-
structor.

It has suddenly been discovered that a
pious and God-fearing semi-limb of the law who
recently left a Sydney suburb for the Golden
Shore was not as good and godly as he ought to
have been. We remember him in the early sixties
when he was the most attentive J.P. on the Mel-
bourne roster, the constant colleague of E. P. S.
Sturt at the City Police Court, and frequently
dispensing ready justice with a lone hand. The
“ forty shillings without the option,” or a
“month’s hard,” came as glibly to his tongue as
to that of the oldest and best-paid P.M. But a
day of trouble was at hand, and the City Bench
and Sergeant Pewtress knew him no more. It
was said that a certain scientific society, of which
he was treasurer, mourned his departure. In
Sydney he surrounded his head with a halo
that the angels might envy, and now we
hear that some thousands of pounds sterling
in trust moneys, the hoardings of widows
and orphans, the savings of careful mechanics
and the “ wee bit money ” put by for a
rainy day have gone at one swell swoop. As long
as the big interest was paid regularly, and it was
paid regularly, the investors did not care to
enquire what kind of security their “ dear friend ”
had invested in. His death proved that his assets
were next to nil and his liabilities some ten thou-
sand, and of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.
However, The Bulletin is scarcely called upon to
sympathise with people who take big interest and
ask no questions.

In a recent case, brought by a firm of
contractors against the N.S.W. Railway Cora-

£24,000, and the Prothonotary calmly taxed off

The imported versus Australian marble
controversy in N.S.W. Parliament reminds one
that years ago Gavan Duffy got into trouble in
Victoria for proposing to use Italian marble in
building Parliament Houses, Melbourne, the
allegation being that “he ordered it because the
Pope had an interest in the quarries.” Yale, or
somebody like that, asked, one night, what kind
of marble had been decided on. Whereupon Dick
Ireland, in Daffy’s absence, said “he didn’t quite
know, but he had heard that it was intended to
use Roman cement,” Which quip settled the
matter.

The Contemporary Review been
gushing over the alleged fact that Albert Edward
is by no means a very bad sort of a husband. It
ought to be easy enough for an Heir-Apparent to
keep up a respectable semblance of conjugal
regard on £150,000 a year and free lodgings. The
real trouble is to idolise your wife when she can’t
get any more “tick” from the sordid-minded
grocer.

It was on the last day of the tour that the
great pianist and tuner met for the last time.
During 20 long years the wealthy piano firm had
told him off to accompany the distinguished
artist, and in all that time he had never been
asked even “if he had a mouth.” The famous
man loquitur : “Oh, Smith, I’ve a little thing I’d
like to give you before saying good-bye, if you will
call at the hotel.” The poor tuner Jog. : “ Oh, it’s
very good of you, sir,” and promised to call.
Smith spends the meantime dreaming of the many
precious things that would be very suitable
rewards after 20 years’ faithful service, and calls
at last at the hotel. Not without a certain shy-
ness, he is shown into the presence of the
maestro, who commences : “ Oh, Smith, I thought
I’d like to give you this before leaving,”- and,
putting his hand into his pocket, he continues :
“ I don’t think I shall require it any more.” It
was the key of the piano. . . . On the second
tour there was a new tuner.

But for his presence of mind a Sydney,
celebrity would have been in a tight place the
other day. He is a fat, unctuous, long-nosed old
man, with a wife and a large, grown-up family—
the sort of man who is a temporary father to the
ballet-maiden, and a counsellor to the milliner’s
little girl, and who likes to take the distressed
barmaid to his enormous bosom, and comfort her.
The last time a girl wanted comforting he diag-
nosed the case, and decided that a tete-a-Ute
dinner would best suit her complaint, so he made
an appointment with her, and ordered the meal
at a swell restaurant. It was a mighty and
expensive feed, and the old man was there to
time, and sat gloating over the victuals. He
waited, and sniffed, and waited. Then a dainty
tread was heard upon the stairs, and another
tread that wasn’t dainty came behind it. The
door opened ; it was the Jong-expected one. He
was just about to wobble into her arms, when his
wife’s visage appeared over the visitor’s shoulder.
Then the girl remarked pleasantly: “This is a
little surprise, Mrs. F.; Mr. F. has got ready for
you, so I won’t detain you any longer,” and,
shaking hands with Mrs. F., she cleared_ out.
And Mr. F. cal ml} 7 embraced his good old wife in-
stead of the girl, and told her how the dinner and
the wines were intended to celebrate the anni-
versary of the death of his aunt’s infant—it was
the only thing he could remember at the moment
—and a hilarious evening was spent. Presence
of mind is a great institution, and has pulled many
a petrified capitalist through.

G. R Sims, who ought to know better
got off a little rhyme in honour of London Punch’s
jubilee. One verse runs :
“ Old Punch, to English hearts so dear,
Long may your mirth bid sadness (lee ;
And may you in your new career,
Which starts from this your jubilee,
The same pure spirit still impart
To English wit and English art.”
The Bulletin, not having a Henglish heart, nor?
taste for Henglish “funny” papers, only hold.
Punch dear—at threepence. The pure spirit ol
that old cockney fetish is a non-intoxicant, but i

Block is devoted to the late Dr. Beaney’s
jewellery. There it lies, cushioned, in a jeweller’s
window. The huge diamond snake-rings that
adorned his digits, and which he swept off into a
basin before operating; the eye-closers that blazed
on his cambric bosom, the wrist-sparklers.
Bathetic is the sight of the double chain which
meandered over his corporation, and into the two
waistcoat pockets.

The suspension of the Y.D.L. Bank
afforded some Hobart folks amusement in the
spectacle of a prominent resident in the prime of
life (holder of a “ fat ” Government appointment)
publicly wringing his hands and actually weeping
over his probable loss. In this condition he was
met by a lady relative whom he greeted with
“ All’s gone, ’Melia, everything’s'lost! ” to which
she un'eelingly responded, “ Go home, you fool.”

lb is said that the last conspicuous de-
faulter who got away from Adelaide left in a
clean-shaved state and disguised as a middle-aged
widow. He was dressed in deep black, and an
accomplice, who addressed him as “ mother,” saw
him on board, and placed him in charge of the
captain. The widow wept bitterly at parting,
and kissed her alleged offspring, and then tottered
feebly to the seclusion of the —ef —ladies’ cabin.

One of the leading lights of a certain S.A.
township has a double-pronged reputation, one
end resting on his exemplary piety and the
assiduity with which he runs a Bible-class twice a
week, and the other on his success in taking prizes
for poultry at shows. Last month ho swept the
board of prizes as usual with birds which came up
to an ideal standard in the matter of markings.
Before the show finished the prizes were with-
drawn because another competitor proved to the
judges, by means of a handkerchief and water,
that the Bible-teacher’s roosters had been carefully
painted up for the occasion. Lesson on Jonah as
usual next night.
Anybody who wants to study human
nature ought to run a jeweller’s shop, a large
fashionable establishment in some such thorough-
fare as Oollins-street, Melbourne, where the dudes
most do congregate. Pretty nearly every jeweller
of this kind has at least one customer who is
obviously going fast to perdition, and yon can
measure how fast he goes by his jewellery.
Generally he is a gaudy individual employed by
some bank or financial institution, and he is
voung, and possessed of a high collar, a small
salary, a feeble underjaw for balancing cigars
upon, and a restless eye which seems to be always
on the look-out lest someone should charge at him
from behind. He comes in furtively the first day,
and buys a big, gold bangle, and makes a hazy,
unnecessary explanation to the effect that his
mother has just come in for a lot of money. He
can always be identified by the bangle and the
explanation, and if any benevolent public institu-
tion, or any watchful philanthropist would seize
him at this stage of his career, and cane him
violently, and tell him distinctly that he has no
mother and doesn’t need a bangle, ho might still
be saved. The want of a society for walloping
young men who buy bangles is one of the crying
necessities of the age. The jeweller smiles a cold,
sardonic smile, for he knows that the youth with
the restless eye and the collar will come
back again. And in a few days he does come
back, and states in an excited tone that his
aunt has just died, and left him a pile ; and then
he buys a diamond brooch, and clears out like a
man in great alarm. Later on he turns up again,
and in a more composed manner dumps down £5O
for a big gold watch, and next day he comes round
in a joyous, case-hardened fashion, and speculate*
in the biggest gold chain in the shop. After that
there is generally a long and solemn pause. But

A NIGHT THOUGHT.
(For The Bulletin.)
The world around is sleeping,
The stars are bright o’erhead,
The shades of myalls weeping
Upon the sward arc spread ;
Among the gloomy pinetops
The fitful breezes blow,
And their murmurs seem the music
Of a song of long ago ;
Soft, passionate, and wailing
Is the tender old refrain—
With a yearning unavailing—
“ Will he no come hack again ?”
The camp-fire sparks are flying
Up from the pine-log’s glow.
The wandering wind is sighing
That ballad sweet and low ;
The drooping branches gleaming
In the firelight, sway and stir ;
And the bushman’s brain is dreaming
Of the song she sang, and her.
And the murmurs of the forest
Ring home to heart and brain,
As in the pine is chorused
“ Will he no come back again ! ’
"THE BREAKER."

These twenty long and weary years,
We put thy numbers on a file
And water them with many tears ;
Thine is the standard British jest
Which lies so heavy on our chest.

When brainy men could swallow Punch ;
A “curtain-lecture,” “cut,” or rhyme
Would help them to enjoy their lunch,

To think what yon.’ve been at ?

Killer.” The unfortunate man was in a bad state
from consumption, and very little hopes were
entertained for his ultimate recovery. After
taking five jars of your “Microbe Killer” he found
great relief, and, continuing with same, is now all

to make what use you think fit of this testimonial,

particular.—Yours, &c.,

turns up for the last time, with his high collar dis-

and a general look of drink and despair, and in a
suicidal sort of way speculates in £25 worth of
gold ring; then heaves a long, broken-winded
sigh, and goes away. Next day the institution is

It is rumoured that another attempt is to
be made in Melbourne to establish a woman’s

Dear Bulletin, —When are the Irish
women in Australia, descendants of the women
sheltered by Mrs. Chisholm, going to erect a
memorial to the “immigrants’ friend?”—E.
* * *
Liberty, published at Perth (W.A.) rises
to ask why a certain citizen should be allowed to
go around the city “hitting people on the head
with an old shirt saturated with water?” Pro-
bably it is because his uncle is related to the
Government.
A lady-correspondent forwards a bright
and lively tale about an imported actress and an
Australian Governor, and sundry troubles which
arose between them about 200 years ago. The
exciting part of the story is where the actress got
into Government House and refused to go out.
She was accompanied by someone who was sup-
posed to be her husband, but who was only a tem-
porary husband borrowed on a steamboat, and
they bad both been at the vice-regal mansion some
time before the row began. Then another im-
ported artist a musician asked what the
Governor meant by introducing him to these
immoral individuals, and the Governor tore his
hair, and sent an aide-de-camp to tell them to
quit. They botli responded cheerfully that his
Excellency “had better peel, and see if he could
chuck them out,” and intimated that there would
be the most awful razzle-dazzle ever seen on these
premises if ho tried. That is how the story goes,
anyhow. When they were gone the viceroy sent
another miserable aide to tell them that their
invitation for the ensuing day was cancelled.
The message he brought back was that the lady
was coming whether her invitation was can-
celled or not, and if necessary she would fight her
way up the stair with a sledge-hammer. She came,
too. She arrived early, and went away late, and
while she was there she pervaded the place,
and froze the whole festivity. She backed respect-
able gentlemen into corners, and talked to them
affably; she bailed up the Governor in a recess,
where he couldn’t escape, and conversed in a
friendly way, and with a heavenly smile on her
countenance ; she collared the aide who had tried
to throw her out, and treated him like a long-lost
brother; and she even seized on the musician who
had given her away, and fraternised with him.
And whenever she pursued and raptured one of
her enemies he thought his last hour had arrived,
and he made such a spectacle of himself in his
efforts to escape that the whole assemblage
laughed. The actress took a fiendish joy in the
business, and at last she would chase an old,
moral, fat man for 20 minutes for the mere
pleasure of arresting him behind a door, and then
going away with an unconscious expression on
her face, as if she had never heard of his existence.
It was a pleasant night, altogether, and the
Governor was worn to rags before it was ended.

Sir Edward Braddon, “K.C.M.G.” (of
which, by the way, they say he is dreadfully
ashamed, and no wonder !), is to be re-appointed
Agent-General for Tasmania for another three
years. He is a clever man, with an iron will, and
has already done the province good service. Sir
Edward is a brother of Miss Braddon, the yellow-
back novelist, but, of course, he can’t help that.

One of the most amiable, learned, and
unassuming men who ever filled a responsible
situation in N.S. Wales—Mr. C. S. Wilkinson,
Government Geologist—has passed away at the
early age of 41. The cause of his death was cancer
in the stomach, a deadly complaint from which,
we are sorry to hear, two other prominent Sydney
men are now suffering.
* *
Swan, M.L.C., of Brisbane, died the
other day, and his will is published under the title
munificent bequests.” There seems to be some-
thing wrong about this title, for the deceased
gentleman leaves to his wife only a life annuity of
£5OO, to be forfeited if she marries again ; and
gives about £27,000 to the various churches, the
Baptists taking most of the pool. This is the
way many an old gentleman gets his name up after
he is dead. His wife, in many cases, has helped
him to make his pile, or has even made his pile for
him. She has done at least a fair half of the
labour, and has put up with much weariness and
snuffle in the effort; and then she loses her hus-
band and loses all her money save a small
annuity, and is left to spend the rest of her years
THAT “HOLY COAT.”

in loneliness and comparative poverty, while
some pious brotherhood annexes three-fourths of
the money and gushes about the munificence of
the deceased. It isn’t really the deceased who is
munificent, for he hung on to the coin to the
last gasp, and didn’t deprive himself of a single
comfort or a single luxury for the sake of tlie
church or any other institution; the munificence
consists in the fact that he deprives his
partner, his wife, of the luxuries which
he wouldn’t surrender himself, and gives the
proceeds of her enforced poverty to the cause.
Nobody is munificent who gives away his money
after he is dead, for then it is his money no
longer, and he is merely giving away somebody
else’s property, and shedding somebody else’s
blood in the interests of terewth. And the
capitalist who decrees that his widow shall be
stripped of her income and left utterly penniless
should she marry again is a posthumous tyrant of
a bad description. If his memory will not be
cherished unless under a penalty of £5OO per
annum for not cherishing it—well, it doesn’t say
much for his memory.
After all, we can learn a lot of things
from the alleged barbarians ! According to
the law of Spain (backward and degraded
as this nation is in many particulars) the
wife has a testamentary interest amounting to
one-half of the capitalised value of her husband’s
absolute estate, which she has the right to leave
to her heirs subject to no conditions imposable by
her husband. Of course, a wife dying before her
husband, usually leaves her portion of the estate
to him. This is a customary rule, but it is a
purely optional matter with the dying testator.

The publicity given to the Colston case
has resulted in a similar tragedy at Stratford
(Vie.). One John Ross murdered an old settler
in his garden, for no particular reason except that
“he had to do it.” The man was seized with an
irresistible desire to do the same as Colston and
get his portrait into the hevenink papers.

“ There is always room at the top.” But

several in Sydney.
From S.M. Herald :

Dark and mysterious item from the
Illustrated Sydney News :
To speak with perfect frankness, there is no denying
the fact that the divine Sarah is plain-or, not to put too
fine a point on it, ugly. No matter what amount of
cnthus'asm her genius for acting arouses, it cannot get
over the fact that her tawny cheeks are a harmony in
colour at the wrong cud of her anatomy.

It seems that young Lord Dudley’s “ in-
tended’’isn’t so very much of an heiress after all, and
that his distressed mama speaks of the approach-
ing marriage as a mesalliance. The Bulletin, by
the way. recently ridiculed the cable lie that
Dudley was engaged to marry one of Tummy’s
daughters, a rumour so transparently boshy that
only a daily newspaper editor would publish it as
a fact.
An advanced Girton girl, according to one
of the magazines, lately said that “the production
of children was only fit for the cow order of
women. ”

The British Solicitor-General :—“ There

Some of the curiosities of banking. Within
the last few days two institutions in Melbourne
have gone on the road where the defunct bank
goes* and they seem to be strangely tangled up.
At least one of them owns most of the shares in
the other, and it had borrowed £60,000 from the
other on the security of the said share®, and when
the first bank broke it wanted to collar most of
the second bank’s assets by way of calls, and the
second I aide closed up in alarm, and left the
liquidator to sort things out. This is a good
system, if it were only carried to its legitimate
c nclnsion. The proper way to run the business
is to start two banks at once, each with a capital
of a million, all paid up, and let each bank own
the whole of the other’s shares. Then as a natural
result each will have, a million pounds, and neither
will have a cent, and everything will be quite
correct all round.

TWILIGHT.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
She lingers at the appointed spot,
Her sweet, young face is very fair,
Her dark, dream-haunted eyes are soft—
And sunset’s gold is on her hair.
The twilight’s gathering gloom reflects
The glory of her lovely form.
The matchless grace of attitude—
The full ripe red of rich lips warm.
She listens to the murmuring sounds
Attending twilight shadows deep ;
And soft the purple sunset hues
In beauty o’er her features creep.
Her eat is strained to catch a sound
A footstep’s sound she knows so well
As far across the trees and flowers
The hour that’s chimed, from distant bell,
Throbs softly on the breeze and falls
In sweetest silence, as the bloom
And glory of the sunset pales
Into the twilight’s gathering gloom.
She cares not for the distant chimes
That swell and die along the breeze—
Nor for the murmuring stream that rhymes
In silv’ry incoherencies—
She waits beside the rustic seat
And listens while the deepening night
Blends a resplendent arch of stars
Above the sunset’s dying light.
The lengthening shadows force the gloom
Athwart the flowers and pathways dark
The gilded moonlight creeping slow
Rocks like a stranded fairy bark-
And still he comes not! Dull and slow
The big, bright teardrops glistening fall;
The fitful shadows darker grow
Deep in the silence—that is all!
But hark ! his footstep sounds at last !
Her heart with rapture leaps to meet
The gladsome music cf his voice,
The echo of his hastening feet.
Fond foolish love that could not wait !
Her bright head on his shoulder slips—
And ah ! her soul in ecstasy
His kiss draws from her pouting lips !
“ 1 was detained, my love,” he said,
By that which would not brook delay ;
Impatiently my fond heart chafid
Ere I could tear myself away ! ”
Oh, doubtful cause of his delay !
Ne’er as he said to part Till death,
Alas, for all he had to say
She smelt the whisky in his breath !

SOAPS and PERFUMES
SPORTING NOTIONS.
Probably the most notable of Australian
aborigines has just “ gone over ” in the person of Johnny
Mullagh, the celebrated cricketer. Mullagh in his day
was a grand all-round athlete, and his fine physical pro-
portions and intelligent speech tempted the Saturday
Review to dub him “ the finest specimen of a savage ever
seen in England.” Mullagh, who spoke English as clearly
as an educated white, was looked upon as a very superior
person by his fellow blacks; in fact, he was generally
addressed as “ Mr.”Mullagh. Bullocky, another of the
team taken to England by Lawrence, was one day playing
against his compatriot at Coleraine, and, as usual, had
been indulging in the rosy. Consequently he swiped a
little too soon at one of Mullagh’s tempters, and the
result proved fatal. When passing the bowler, Mullagh
said, “ What made you slog at that one, Bullocky ? ”
“ Well, Mr. Mullagh,” was the response, “I bin see two
balls, and 1 hit at the wrong one.” Mullagh was the last
of his tribe. Though quite black he was comely, his pro-
file being of a pronounced Semitic type.

Cable announces that the English bookmakers
have been ordered to clear out of France forthwith. The
fraternity of Anglo-French commission-agents, as they
called themselves, started business.in Boulogne more than
twenty years age, “Boy ’ Wright, Webster and Johnny
Gideon being about the first to send out circulars and
price-lists from across the Channel. An attempt to carry
on the game in Edinburgh—after the London police had
put the Betting Act in force, and ousted all advertising
list-men from their original offices—was tolerated for a
short time, but eventually a Scotch law was brought to
bear upon the case, and these bloated exiles from the
Fleet-street district had to find a home amongst the
mounseers. Providence has been very good to them all
this time. So much English money was sent across that
they became, through their home agents, the biggest
regular customers of the London bookmakers, that is to
say, their agents would constantly receive instructions
to “back in” the horses which were overlaid to large
amounts on the book at Boulogne or Paris. Their purely
local harvest, too, must have been considerable every
year, because the British “bookey” has always reigned
supreme on French racecourses, where his disgust for
betting in “ naps ” instead of “quids” was expressed in
lurid adjectives. Probably'there is no intention on the
part of the authorities to shut out English layers of odds
from French meetings. They will, we presume, still cross
the Channel to attend the Grand Prix and other big
events, bringing their brass-bound volumes with them.
But it would seem that the resident leviathan, the tissue
list-issuer, is not to be tolerated any longer, and unless
he can find another resting-place in Brussels or Amster-
dam, this particular variety of gambling institution will
soon fade out of recollection, like the tables at Monaco.
Nevertheless, backing horses will go on much about the
same as usual, until horse-racing is suppressed, and the
lamb and the “lamber” lie down together. Meanwhile
the cable announces again that the French authorities
having reconsidered their decision the bookmakers have
not been expelled. Thus the above is all lost sentiment
and waste reflection.

Seeing that Sullivan’s theatrical season in Aus-
tralia can’t be making his fortune or enriching his
manager beyond the dreams of avarice, the sporting
world racks its fuddled brain to understand why “ Jonel”
doesn’t drop the drama for a while and fill in the interval
by fighting for £2OOO purses and things, the manager to
take a share of the profits. The excuse that he can
11 make more dollars at acting ” avails them no longer. It
won't wash. Victory in another big fight would mean
money in the drammer anon, and the Slugger doesn’t
fight, not so much because he suspects that any good
man would kill him in the third round, as because he
knows that a certain defeat would knock the last spark
of life out o? bis show, anyway.
According to Melbourne advices, Duncan Ross
and Donald Dinnie want to arrange a partnership with
John L. Sullivan and C. M‘Hardy, and then the four of
them are to meet any six men Australia can produce in a
go-as-you-please fighting contest.” The idea pleases us
considerably ; a go-as-you-please fight, four men against
six, would be a cheerful novelty, provided it were all
square and genuine. Then the parties would simply rush
each other and bash promiscuously, and the man who
was up would tramp on the man who was down, and the
man who was down would bite the legs of the man who
was up. The man with the longest legs would kick the
nost opponents on the ear, and the longest opponent
would keep his ear out of the range of the most men with
i egs ’ "’hereby the short man wmuld have his ear
sicked and the long man would keep his listener in a
place of safety. There would be a mad skurry at the
egmmng of the proceedings, and the party who first got
n enemy by the hair and knocked his head against the
noor would have the best show; and if Donald
~ I 1 fought in kilts and two of his opponents got
com of the back of the kilts, and kicked like fiends
m * e * he " ould probably be knocked out. Everybody
. d try to maul his enemy from behind, and the man
iho 6 :. an t a !?onist was disabled would go and help to welt
snitf- her fellow’s antagonist, and everybody would be
plnfvf Q ng °m!' hair and ears > and tearing off his “opponent’s
wrmM ,f lcn 111 the lllad rush and clatter the parties
ouia gallop on each other, and the bruiser who was just
n ' . e P 01,lt; °f victory would be distracted by six men
,‘ n » over him, and flattening him out; and the
firm* 1 *H S P u S d ists would rave and howl in the fore-
wa„ i.i tfle battle, and those who were not courageous
wnnnH P, ro "'l. m the rear > and pound the dead and
unnlli k . llna, b r > towards the end of the show, there
and fL, S 1? °, ri PP les hung out to dry on the fence,
Hip n?vi'i. naied survivors scratching and clawing in

behind-u .others would recover and stun him from
fiwht a bl = wooden chair. Yes, a go-as-you-please
orio-inni t ‘. llen in one ring, would be a bright and
two J„ e i"r l ' ta, " luen b and only the united denseness of
Moren,? 0 .i nen oould have suggested such an idea.
profpmSn r ’ the pnnwpal Scotchman can’t fight; he is a
up of ?. lfter of heavy weights and a tearer-
nuentiii ff'tronks, but boxing is not in his line. Conse-
enemioo hls , one idea would be to pick up one of his
„ les ’ and swing him round in the air, and brain the
rest vyith his feet; or else he would chuck his foes out of
the ring and throw them against the wall; and all would
he mad confusion and howls and rags and trorc. The pro-
ceeds, we presume, would go to the hospital for in-
curables.

Criffo is to fight Burge (the sire of seven
children), who has shown that he can come down to
feather-weight. Griffo is thus going to “fight his
father,” and will probably meet his first licking. The
cast-iron man, whom Qeo. Dawson couldn’t knock out,
and who held up his jaw for M'Kenzie to punch at, isn’t
likely to be troubled by either Griffo’s blows or his
endurance.
* * *
The Age stupidly took Judge Hamilton to
task for his pertinent summing-up of Mr. John F.
Sheridan’s midnight attack on Middleton. Judge
Hamilton went right down to the root of the matter
when he said: “The assault had been committed in a
manner that would not commend itself to any manly
mind. Hitting a man a blow from behind might be con-
sidered heroic in America, where the defendant came
from, but it was not so in Australia.” This is what
the Age terms “indulging in gratuitously offensive
expressions against a nation as against an indivi-
dual,” whereas the allusion was not quite so
gratuitous as it looked. A very brief acquain-
ance with the land of J. L. Sullivan would convince an
Age journalist that there are blots on the "Murrikan
civilisation of the smart Yankee. He is apt to be nastier
in quarrel and more promiscuous in his modes of wreaking
vengeance than the average Australian, or the decently
educated Britisher. He may not arm himself with kicking
clogs like the Lancashire lad, but he still hankers after a
“ shooter,” and his notions of chivalry are bad for the man
who has left his “iron” at home. In fact, there is a dis-
position amongst the Bohemians of the West to put.
blackguardism on a pedestal and worship the man who
draws first blood any way he darned well chooses. A
good many other Bohemians are built the same way.
When Mr. Hamilton touched upon the characteristics
of Widdy O’Brien’s “stoush and run” policy he spoke
like a man of the world and a brother, and was no more
gratuitously offensive than judges are frequently com-
pelled to be, or daily newspapers constantly are, without
being compelled. When a raw Italian sticks a knife into
an Australian citizen, the Judge always reminds him that
such customs of his country are not approved of here. As
for the Age, so thoughtful for the feelings of America,
the dear creature is never happy unless it is insulting the
Irish nation point-blank, or by innuendo.

The programme of the Western Australian Turf
Club for its New Year’s meeting (January Ist and 4th,
1892) has been issued. The first day’s events are:—
Maiden Plate, of 50sovs.; Nursery Stakes, cf bOsovs. ;
Selling Race, of SOsovs.; Perth Cup, a handicap of 400sovs.,
2 miles ; Ladies’ Purse and the Flying Stakes, each of
50sovs. Second day Metropolitan Hurdles, of 70sovs.;
West Australian Derby, of 75sovs.; Railway Stakes, a
handicap of 17550v5.; City Purse and Farewell Handicap,
each of 50sovs.; and the Queen’s Plate, of lOOsovs., 3 miles.
The amount of this last event is contributed by the
Government of the province as an inducement to owners
and breeders. The club owns a nice little course about
four miles from the city, and which is connected with the
latter by rail.

Jem Hall, the Australian middle-weight

Melbourne Agricultural Show, where Spondulix got over
bft. 9in. (carrying list. 71b.); Cedric, bft. 7in.; and High-
lander, bft. 4in. The American jumper has a
record of 7ft. 2Jin.

! Editor Bulletin, — “E. K.” wants to know in
j what year Bob M‘Laron came to Australia. I was in the
next cabin to him on the voyage out. We left Liverpool
I on New Year s Day, 1857, in the good ship James Baines,
' and arrived in Hobson’s Bay on March 15, 1857. Bob was
then from California, and when I left for Maoriland, in
’62, he was a policeman in the Main Hoad in Ballarat. I
never heard of his being known by the name of Thomp-

Our thirst for knowledge isn’t great,
We do not itch or burn
To learn the secrets of the State—
They give us small concern ;
We don't aspire to read the stars
That twinkle through the night,
We simply hang around the bars
Or shops that “ kid ” to sell cigars,
And ask “ Is Carbine right?”
The world it may be square or round.
We do not want to know,
(You see, we put our little pound
Upon him long ago)—
And when Protection is discuss’t
We never join the fight;
In Parkes or Dibbs we put no trust—
All questions fill us with disgust
Save this : “ Is Carbine right ?”
The Labour-party’s prospects ne’er
Excite our weary brain ;
If Federation’s in the air,
Well, there it can remain,
Let others have ideas sublime,
And hanker after “ light,”
Whilst we, who pen this funny rhyme,
Will merely ask, from time to time,
“ Is Carbine keeping right ?”
FROM SYDNEY TO MELBOURNE ON
BICYCLES.
INCIDENTS BY THE WAY.
Mr. J. Pearson, of King-street Arcade, tha
well-known cycling tourist, when riding over to
Melbourne with his friend, Mr. A. G. Chapman,
relates several adventures they met with on their
long journey:
For four days after leaving Sydney terribly web
weather was experienced, and many of the water-
courses, which in the summer time arc nearly dry,
were swollen so much that they had great difficulty
in crossing some of them.
On one occasion they were compelled to strip
and carry their machines across, the current being
so strong that they were in imminent danger of
being swept away. Although they were for
several days riding in wet clothes no dire results
accrued, as on each evening after retiring they
took the precaution to rub themselves down with
St. Jacobs oil, which Mr. Pearson always carries
with him on his tours, finding it a capital remedy
for stiffness and soreness of the muscles, as well
as a preventative and cure for painful ailments
induced by cold.
After getting over the dividing range the
weather changed from wet and cold to excessive
heat. On one day especially the thermometer was
98 in the shade.
Numerous snakes were met with on the journey,
passing several coiled up in the middle of the road.
One monster, over six feet long, caused them some
trouble, as in trying to avoid it the two cyclists
collided, the result of which was a bruised wrist
and a swollen ankle, but the application of the
ever ready St. Jacobs oil prevented any bad
effects. They reached Melbourne safely, averaging
64 miles per day, and received a great reception
from their brother wheelmen of the southern
capital.
St. Jacobs Oil may be obtained from any
respectable chemist, storekeeper, or dealer.
Demand St. Jacobs Oil, and positively refuse to
accept any of the numerous substitutes which are
frequently tendered in its stead.
ANTI-MACASSARS.
These are to some extent a relic of a semi-
barbarous past, but many of them are still exceed-
ingly beautiful, and of great domestic importance.
They have exercised a soothing influence in a large
number of households for many years, and are
frequently carried about by the proprietary, en-
tangled upon the back buttons of his coat, if the
cat has not already dragged them off the chairs to
make a home for her young family in an obscure
corner of the floor. Bad tempered men have been
known to make hasty and unfeeling remarks about
the general uncertainty of anti-macassars, and
what they conceive to be their proper value in
the sphere of domestic economy, but the article
is nevertheless useful for making impromptu
dolls for the younger children, for stuffing rat-
holes, for chasing the wily cockroach to his
lair, and frequently for exciting the envy of a
neighbor and the comments of a whole street. The
anti macassar has also a decided advantage over
every other artie’e classified as belonging to the
family linen-chest —it can be hung out to dry in
the most unprotected spot without danger of
being stolen. Nobody ever yet stole one con-
sciously, and principally because—no matter how
lovely—they are of small commercial value.
Their area is uncertain and color various, >
depending almost entirely on the tastes of the
owner. They are made of many fabrics, and in
millions of patterns. A very favorite pattern for
the modern anti macassar is said to be produced
with a bone needle and a hank of sail twine, the
stitch being chain 3, drop 1, purl 6, tie the ends
together, then reverse and repeat to the size
required. This is the one supposed to be referred
to by Byron in the couplet—
In virtues nothing earthly could surpass her,
Save fhine ‘‘incomparable oil,” “Macassar!”
And the quotation happily reminds us that
there is one even more incomparable oil than that,
the beauties of which have been much testified to
of late, and that is Luxene, the new illuminant,
which stands alone as a light giver, as a house-
wives’ friend, and as a guarantee against accidents
and danger by land or sea. Luxene is the very
perfection of an illuminant for all these and many
other reasons, not the least of which is its economy
in everyday use. Messrs. J. Barlow and Co.,

HOUSE FURNISHERS,
608 GEORGE STREET. SYDNEY
We have received, a new novel entitled
“ Making his Pile; A Colonial Story,” published
by Mason, Firth, and M‘Cutcheon, and written
by Justin Charles M'Cartie. The name on the
title-page creates an impression, at the outset,
that the work is by another Justin —but this mis-
apprehension very soon wears off. The new
volume has an elegant yellow cover, showing the
moon rising over a waste of waters, with an em-
bittered bank-clerk and another misanthrope on
the desolate shore in the foreground ; and the
whole thing weighs about lialf-a-pound. Ihe
contents relate to sundry young men of lofty
character and irreproachable morals who come out
from England and settle in Dunedin, where they
are fawned upon and grovelled to by the entire
population, because the local inhabitant always
grovels to the new-chum, and worships him above
every other thing on this earth. These young men,
owing to their high principles and other causes, are
the only visible oases in the black, sin-smothered,
soul-blasted waste of iniquity which pervades
all Maoriland, and they have a hard row to
hoe in making head against the unclean thing
generally. In the 22nd chapter all the natives
bolt with the cash unanimously, and leave the prin-
cipal good young man from “Home” naked, save
for his rectitude. Then he takes up arms against
a sea of troubles, and fights his way through a
whole nation of low, base miscreants till he gets
to the wharf, and leaves Maoriland for ever.
There is nothing in the book save the irreproach-
able young man from “Home,” and the blasted
local deceiver. The tale is plain and harmless;
the hero is remarkably like a left-off person by
Ouida, and the horrid “ kawlinist ” is partly an
impossible character out of Eever, and partly the
cheap and greasy money-lender out of Trollope s
“Three Clerks.” Most of him comes to a bad
end. The other man marries a heroic and beauti-
ful girl employed in a refreshment-room, and lives
happily ever afterwards.
The London & Sydney Tea Co. supply squatters
and farmers at wholesale prices.
Dear Bulletin, —I have taken a large interest
in you from way back in Maoriland, and have read you
right through. But on one thing we must disagree.
Sound or cronk, a man who slays his fellow-creature in
cold gall should be put to death ; he is not fit to live,
his remains, however offensive, are better guests at a
wake than his live carcase, and the writer would rather
sleep with Colston in the early stages of decay than when
possessed of life and vigour and a meat-axe. I like your
paper because [marmalade omitted —Ed.]— but you will
never persuade me that capital punishment is bar-
barous. I hold that a homicidal maniac is much
better company with a saucer of salt on his bosom, a
tallow-candle illuminating his noble brow, and a raw
potato keeping his chin in place. If I had my way I
would kill every one of them on sight. You should be in
» lunatic-asylum for a year —not that I want to see
you there — to know' something about murderers
doing the Queen’s pleasure. If it be any pleasure to the
Queen to know that these ruffians are as crafty as a fox,
and that they will brain a warder with a shovel or broom,
just for the fulfilment of a grudge, and then laugh it off
as a good joke, the Queen must have a lot of fun. Do you
know what ‘‘ During the Queen’s pleasure ” means ? No.
Well, I will tell vou. It means that a criminal “fly”
enough (and they are “ fly”) to listen to the chaplain and
attend prayers with a profound expression of humility
and repentance will be turned loose in about ten years, a
worse savage than when he was put there. Don t j ou
make any methylated error about this ! It is a cast-iron
fact, and it can’t be softened down to the tenacity of
horse-nails by any specious argument you can advance.
The jury in Colston’scase were quite right. Sane orinsane,
the man was better dead. You can’t get over it. If you
own a mad dog or a glandered horse—which, thanks to
your exceptionally healthy climate you never will own
would you not destroy him in the speediest fashion ? You
would shovel him away into cold earth as an incurable
nuisance, and now you want me and a hundred thousand
others to believe that a lunatic who slays because his grey
brain matter likes it that way, is fit to live “during her
Majesty’s pleasure,” or the pleasure of anybody. ,No,
dear Bulletin, break his neck by all means, and break it
quick. As I said before, you should have 12 months-oh,
no, what I was going to say was, experience. _ About half
the people now in gaol should have died young. If some
of them have been flogged they only got the wrong end
of the rope—the noose end is what they wanted.
Humanity to one gory prisoner means gross inhumanity
to all the rest of creation. The said g. p. is a standing
menace to society while he draws breath. I suppose every
creature that draws breath is an animal. Yes. Well, this
is the worst kind of an animal, and the sooner he ceases
to draw breath the better for all humans.—I am &c.,
J. M. W. Dunedin (Maoriland), August 11, 1891. [Our
correspondent is a stern utilitarian. He would poll-axe
his paralysed father and visit with the gallows the
demented victim of puerperal fever. Prevention is better
than cure. You can trust no lunatic ; therefore, all mad
people should be slain. —Ed. B.]

Judge M‘Farland still takes his little
snack on Sydney District Court bench, though
the sight of a judicial dignitary with his mouth
distended like that of Jem in “Lights o’ Lon-
don,” is certainly not awe-inspiring. Judge M‘E.
has a follower in his “eccentricity” in Judge
Richmond, of N.Z., who regularly has “afternoon
tea brought to him while he is in court.
Young Earl Dudley’s fiancee is Miss
Rachel Gurney (daughter of Gurney, of Overend,
Gurney and Co.) who is the adopted daughter of
the Duchess of Bedford. The Duke, it is said,
will give her £lOO,OOO as dot, which sounds un-
likely, as he is the meanest old hunks alive. Miss
Gurney is very handsome, very accomplished, and
is one of the best amateur singers in England.
George Ooppin intends to move in the
Victorian Council that potatoes shall be “exempt
from the sales prohibited on Sunday.” The
veteran speaks feelingly. There is an ancient
tradition that lie always carries a potato in Lis
trousers-pocket to ward olf the gout. Picture
his position if he felt a warning twinge after his
Sunday’s dinner —and never a tater in the house !
Another of Tummy’s friends is being-
shown-up for his infamous neglect of his wretched
tenantry. A medical officer recently reported
that the “ wood huts ” on Sir Tatton Sykes’
estate “are absolutely unfit for human habita-
tion.” There is just one grain of excuse for Sir
Sykes. He is understood to have partially ruined
himself in entertaining the Prince and his grass-
hopper-like mob.
Writing of Father Walsh, who died
recently at Port Macquarie, N.S.W., a country
paper tells how one of his Lithgow parishioners
thus delivered herself to him on one occasion:—
“Yer riv’rence, that ould Misthtress Kelly up
there beyant does be saying that the clergy should
be practising and not be praching so much ; and
she said, bad luck to the same old woman for a
long tongue she has, that last Monday as yo was
going to Sydney, yer riv’rence tuk a bottle of
porther at wan dhrink for yer lunch ; and I up
and told her she was a liar.” Without a smile
came the reply in Father Walsh’s best brogue ;
“ True for you, Mrs. Rafferty, my good sowl; it
was what you called her that she was : for I tuk
two !”
MISS CREO STANLEY
(The first Lady Delegate to the N.S.W. Trades and
Labour Council)
Lady Jersey was not always content to
write meek little poems. Somebody has been
good enough to send us a copy of the Banbury
(Eng.) Guardian of July 1, 1886, containing a
howling oration by iier ladyship on the necessity
for Toiy coercion in Ireland. It is garnished with
many flowers of oratory about the incapacity of
the old Irish-Parliament—which, by-the bye, was
an English Protestant Parliament, only Lady
Jersey smothers that fact; about the alleged
period when Irishmen boiled English people to
death—which reminds ns also of how the Anglo-
Saxon of the same period used to torture political
offenders to deatli by piling paving stones on their
stomachs ; and other matters. Also she complains
that Gordon of Khartoum was killed by the
“poisonous breath”-of Mr. Gladstone, which
seems rather steep, unless Gladstone habitually
breathes by submarine cable. Altogether it is a
daisy of a speech, two columns long ; and it winds
up with poetry about the flag of our fathers.
How long is Melbourne to be hidebound ?
The week before last we had a £5 fine for selling
twopenn’oth of potatoes, on Sunday, to a poor
woman. A few weeks ago was another case, £5
fine, for a bottle of gingerbeer, supplied to a
little boy, out walking with his parents, on a hot,
dusty Sunday.
A tragic event has cast a gloom ove r
fashionable society in Paris. There was a high-
toned dinner party in progress, and in tho middle
of it the host’s big dog came in, and genially ate
two immense mouthfuls out of the vital parts of
the principal guest, who died a few minutes after-
wards. This new feature in dinner-parties has
created a feeling of depression in polite circles.
That Unknown Quantity—Happiness.
Euclid might have achieved a greater fame than
he now holds, had lie propounded this problem—
“ Given a straight line, find happiness.” And
then all the world would have thought itself into
a bald and unconvincing condition in trying to
solve the problem. Possibly the eminent Geome-
trician did state this proposition in his last books,
but these were burned in the conflagration of an
ancient library, and we have not time just now to
rake over the debris. For all that, man, from
the very beginning of the world, has tacitly set
himself to solve the problem, and has barely suc-
ceeded until the capacity for enjoying his know
ledge had been buried with his forgotten years,
and disregarded opportunities. So then logically
with,the foregoing, man is happy only when he is
un.onscious of his happiness. Happiness is mo.tly
a question of health, winch again is the well-being
of organs, which the owner is hardly conscious of
possessing. The best news in the world will not
make a hypochondriac dance, nor a rheumatic
martyr sing—the effect on his mind is joyous, but
the mental joy is counteracted by the material
misery. How many men have we seen praying
for death —a visitor terrible even in the most
alluring form, and clad in the most peaceful garb,
because everything they have used has failed, and
they think that nothing can be done to save them
from impending death? They read this, or are
advised by friends to test the sterling virtues of
Warner’s Safe Cure. They do so, and in a few
weeks the sallowness of the invalid has vanished,
and the pink of health is being forced into their
cheeks. Well it is happiness to sec those respited
prisoners enjoying their m wly obtained health, it
is happiness to them and to you if you have a
heart for the troubles of other men. William
Hill, a railway gatekeeper at St. Arnaud, (Vic.),
was in such a state of living death, and to his
happiness on regaining health, let his own words
testify. Here is his letter :—Dead bot yet Alive.
St. Arnaud, Victoria.—l was a martyr to chronic
gout for a term of 34 years, during which time I
spent over two thousand pounds on different
doctors, having to pay £3 and £4 a visit in the
early days of the colony. I also tried change of
air in different parts of the colony, but never got
any permanent relief. I was given up on several
occasions by the doctor, and once he told my wife
I could not possibly live till the morning. 1 have
been confined to my bed over 21) months, part of
the time quite insensible, but in spite of all I
managed to live on in misery to myself and
every one about me—dead but yet alive. It was
during this critical time my wife read of some
wonderful cures by the use of Warner’s safe cure,
and was determined I should try it as a last re-
source. The doctor at this time had given me up,
and said he could do nothing for me. I began the
use of safe cure, having to pay five shillings and
sixpence per bottle, but money was no object
where life was concerned ; after a few weeks I
was able to sit up, and continued to improve. I
continued its use until I have taken thirty or forty
bottles of Warner’s safe cure, and several vials of
Warner’s safe pills. lam now able to get about
and enjoy life once more. lam G 7 years of age.
My friends tell me I must have an iron constitu-
tion, but I tell them it is owing to Warner’s safe
cure, and I shall never cease to be grateful for tho
benefits I derived from its use.—William Hill,
Gate Keeper on the Railway. What further
proof is desired ?
Black Tommy,” the aborigine now under
committal for tomahawking and criminally
assaulting a woman (since dead) at West
Maitland, N.S. Wales, had, only a few days
prior to the offence, been liberated from the
local gaol after serving a sentence of six months for
a somewhat similar crime. Previous to that he
had “done” 10 years for horse-stealing. He is
an athletic fellow of gigantic proportions, and a
bit of a “pug.” Tommy is an expert stone-
cutter. Curiously enough almost every Australian
b'ack in the gaols of N.S.W. has been convicted
cf an offence against decency, the only notable ex-
ception being “ Tommy Pyan,” who is finishing a
term at Darlinghm st for gaol breaking and nearly
killing the arresting policeman.
Editor Bulletin,—You ask how the pro-
hibitionist teetotallers would deal with the Aus-
tralian wine-industry. Those knowing the views
and aims of the cranks and hypocrites who form
the backbone of the “ temperance ” movement well
know that they would deal with it summarily.
It is, however, doubtful w hether they will ever
luiye the power of deciding the question. The
failure of their pet scheme, local option, in Canada
and certain parts of the States, has produced such
a split in the temperance camp that it will be a
long time ere they can put forward an effectual
solution from their point of view of the drink
Problem. The object of these remarks is to point
out a means by which the liquor question and ti e
wine industry can be simultaneously and satisfac-
torily dealt with. I maintain that theGothenburgh
licensing system could be easily applied in Aus-
tralia. In Sweden beer is subject to no legal
restrictions either as to sale or manufacture.
Were the Gothenburgh plan tried here we could
have free trade in wine, while the profits arising
from the sale of beer and spirits could be devoted
to national objects, such as the maintenance of
police, gaols, asylums, and other institutions
brought into existence principally thro' gh the
present liquor traffic. Moreover, the traffic would
be a pure one, for the vendor would be a public
servant paid by salary, and, unlike our friend
Bung, would not, by adulteration and other
methods, hasten to accumulate a fortune so that
he and Ins wife might pick a bone and shake a leg
at Government House.— Yours, E.

Protection is the better policy and will come with Federa-
tion. (2) The Protectionists are openly eager for office ;
the Labour-party up to date is only openly eager for
reform. As the Party consists partly of Freetraders and
partly of Protectionists, there can be no effective action
without sinking the fiscal question, which has been done
as far as possible. (3) The Bulletin has already expressed
the opinion that the Labour-party, or rather a section of
it, has behaved ungratefully to a number of good friends
of labour who happened to be Protectionists. This in-
gratitude has been adroitly fostered by the constant
interested nagging and misrepresentation of the Foreign-
trade press. (4) The rift in the Labour ranks is caused on
one side by the ill-concealed aggressiveness of the Single-
tax section, and on the other by the activity of the side
which regards Protection as a panacea for all evils. (5)
Had they made such a declaration they would have been
nowhere ; nevertheless their policy is the best under the
circumstances. So long as they remain solid they will be
powerful. (6) The bribery story emanated from an alto-
gether too clever and virtuous individual, who seemingly
mistook an offer to pay his election expenses up to date
as a condition of retirement, for an attempt to corrupt
him “A.D.C.”: Not worth space; case evidently
founded on a mere mistake. The cabman’s chance arrives
when the fare happens to be in blissful ignorance of the
fact that he is living at the rate of 4s. an hour— “L.L.” :
The Trades and Labour Council motion, congratulating
Bruce Smith and J. H. Young on their friendship to
Labour, is, of course, intended as a smart piece of satire
by the’Andy Kelly faction. You are an abjectly duil
person. [Many replies held over.]
The London dockers buy their clothes in
cheap auction-rooms at eighteen pence per suit.
How" the married man whose average wage is 10s.
weekly, affords even that is a mystery.
“ Joseph Drysdale,” writing from Blackall,
Q., points out that a number of men charged
with various crimes are awaiting trial before the
Supreme Court at Rockhampton in September,
and that a fund is being formed to provide counsel
for their defence. Otherwise they will be un-
defended.
Mr. D. J. M‘Leod, late the able manager
for the A.M.P. Society at Auckland (M.L.), has
been in Sydney during the past few weeks enjoy-
ing a well-earned rest. He now proceeds to
Melbourne to fill an important position in the
service of the same big Society in that city.
Balmaceda, the defeated Chilian Pre-
sident, is described as a very fair-haired man of
over six feet with a dash of Indian blood whence
comes his cruelty.
The Maoriland Treasurer lately signed his
name at the bottom of a Maori advertisement,
“ Monita Whakahiri o te mone o te kirone,
which, being interpreted, is “The Minister who
makes the money of the colony fly.”
Sydney Illustrated News, apropos to
some remarks in the Review of Reviews, avers
that “ Parkes has not been defeated, but has a
working majority at his back.” Just as we read
this we looked out of the window and saw an
unwilling drunk being hustled quod-wards by
three able-bodied, policemen. That man, thought
we, had also at his back a working majority.
The Germans appear to have been taking
a hand in the Chilian trouble ; anyhow, the war
seems to have been used as a preliminary canter-
ground for Mannlicher rifles and smokeless
powder. The result of the attack made by Bal-
maceda’s comparatively big force upon entrenched
positions defended by the insurgents falls in with
Archibald Forbes’ opinion that smokeless powder
and repeating rifles now render assaults hopeless.
At one of “General” Booth's English
farewell meetings he asked those who had found
faith to stand up. All stood except the members
of the Press, whose attitude was adroitly inter-
preted by Booth as an evidence of a mistaken
desire to remain impenitent. Yet it was more
probably an outward sign of that lack of faith
in anything or anybody, which appears to be the
inevitable outcome of a journalistic life. And as
in England so in Australia. At none of the many
church-assemblies, etc., attended by the present
writer in his capacity as a reporter has he ever
known the newspaper men to remain while
prayers were going on.
Mr. T. S. Dick writes from Burnside,
S.A., to say that The Bulletin in ascribing
the invention of the sheep-shearing machine,
known as the “Wolseley,” to a Victorian
engineer, is wrong; that the invention is
Mr. Wolseley’s, who worked at it, to our corres-
pondent’s personal knowledge, 12 years ago; and
that Mr. Wolseley exhibited it in a primitive state
11 years ago to a number of gentlemen including
Mr. William Waugh, lately one of the holders of
Dungaleer Station, and Captain Fisher, now S.M.
of Sydney. Our correspondent adds that, from
what Mr. Wolseley told him years ago, the sub-
ject has engaged that gentleman’s attention for
a quarter of a century.
Commination services were held in Sydney
Domain last Sunday, when George Perry and
other Monks of the Screw denounced seriatim
the Demon of Drink, the Demon of Smoke, the
Maid of the Private Bar, Commissioners Eddy
and Oliver, Judge Tavish M‘Sneevish, and the
great Hi Ham. One of George’s lieutenants,
traversing the arguments of an opponent on
the Women’s Rights Question, said: “My
friend’s assertions indicate that he has not studied
woman physiologically, psychologically, nor
phrenologically. I maintain,” etc. No, he had
studied her diametrically, diagonally, and didacti-
cally, and moreover con amove. As Colonel Diver
says : “ It is by such enlightened means that the
bubbling passions of our country find a vent.” If
the polysyllabic fiend had tarried much longer lie
would have been rent in twain.
Murderer Colston’s final confession of
faith was the sane-seeming production of a
quiescently-mad brain.
The sea-serpent has fallen through again
in the usual way. That is to say, one ship recently
sighted the sea-serpent, and a day or two later
another ship sighted what might have been the
sea-serpent only it was a tree instead, and because
the tree wasn’t a sea-serpent it is unanimously
resolved that there isn’t any such serpent at all.
And, in the same way, we were aroused the other
night by a horrid row in the back yard, and con-
cluded that it was Parkes, but when we went out
it was only a goat, and seeing that goat wasn’t
Parkes, therefore it is evident that there isn’t any
Parkes whatever.
Dear Bulletin, —Some obnoxiously-in-
quisitive friends of mine want to know if the
contractor for Sydney G.P.O. clock will lose his
£1000 deposit for not having completed his con-
tract within the specified time—viz., nine months.
A man well known to theN.S.W. mechanical pro-
fession went to look at the plans and specifications
when tenders were called some 20 months ago, and
his attention was particularly drawn by the clerk
in charge to the £1000 forfeiture clause. It was
an impossibility, he reckoned, to finish the clock
as per specifications in the time stated, so the
would-be contractor refrained from tendering.
Suggestive, this. Anyhow, what about the £1000?
—Yours, A. D., Mittagong.
Dean Bulletin. —lie your printed, wish
that public libraries would cease taking your red-
covered paper so as to increase the number of
your subscribers : —For some years I ran a paper
near the border of two of the colonies. A new
farming district, 20 miles away from the office,
furnished about 50 subscribers, all good marks, who
regularly paid their 24s. per annum. A little
township grew there and it was decided to build a
mechanics’ institute by public subscription. On
the strength of the place supporting the paper t
subscribed three guineas. Presently the institute
was opened and at the first meeting of the
Committee they asked for a free copy of my paper
as it was for a public institution. Bequest
complied with, and the result was that during the
following month 23 of the most regular payers
stopped their paper because “they though; it
was their duty to support their new institute.”
Thus was charity rewarded. —Yours G. A.
Secuked Deposits.— In view of the promised
legislation to regulate the business of those finan-
cial institutions which receive money on deposit
from the public, we are pleased to notice that a
step in the right direction has been taken by the
Universal Land and Deposit Bank, Limited, who,
in a little pamphlet entitled “Mutual Banking,”
have called attention to a few points of practical
interest to all bank depositors. The main idea of
the above company appears to be that the
depositors, not the shareholders, should be the
first to receive the benefit of the profits made by
the bank, whilst, by the issue of debentures, they
(the depositors) obtain a first lien over all the
assets of the concern and are in possession of a
collateral security equal to the sum deposited,
which, by the way, bears interest. The scheme
is entirely novel, and we think the originators
deserve the support of the public in their efforts
to improve the position of the depositor. We'
commend the above-mentioned pamphlet to the
attention of our readers who contemplate invest-
ing their money in this manner. It is forwarded
post free to any address by the bank, whose office
is at 301 Pitt-street, Sydney.*

The Evolution of a Journalist.
(FOR THE BULLETIN)
Editor Bulletin,—
Sir, —I have long desired to embrace a literary career,
and niy friends have advised me to apply to you to see
if there might not be an opening on your staff. I anl 19
years of age and a junior teacher in a State school. My
friends assure mo that I have Considerable literary
ability. I myself feel that t have a good command of
English, and can write grammatically and in good style.
It has always been my ambition to become a reporter,
and, if you have no vacancy which 1 can fill, will you
kindly advise me how to gain a footing in the journalistic
world ? All niy friends assure me that I would be a
success as a reporter and writer, and they admire my
essays Very much indeed. Please reply by return of post,
as t am eager to change my vocation.—Yours, &0., John
Obammcm.
The above is a paraphrase from memory of a
genuine letter recently received, and a fair sample
of many constantly coming to hand. It is with
no view of discouraging latent literary genius that
I pen this screed, for a soul with a mission will
fulfil that mission against all odds. But I desire
to dissipate some of the fen-fires,, some of the
jack-o’-lanterns, that danoe mockingly among
journalistic marshes, and glorify to deluded
imaginations the life of the reporter.
An ordinary press hack is about as miserable a
slave as the world holds. The outsider regards
the scribe with awe, or reverence, or envy. With
awe, under the impression that the pallid reporter
is “a power in the land,” whereas he is only as
mere an automaton as a caligraph. With rever-
ence, under the belief that the brassy interviewer
of Ministers of the Crown and other so called
“personages,” is on intimate terms with these
notabilities, Whereas the said Ministers and
“ personages ” regard him as a superior sort of
flunkey, created to be humbugged and fooled by
masked condescension, large whiskys, and free
cigars. With envy, under the delusion that the
bottled-nosed frequenter of theatres, or attendant
at champagne luncheons and banquets, is a
Welcome and honoured companion and guest of
the alleged “great ones ” of the earth, whereas he
Is only a tolerated scout and advertiser of
masquerading humbugs. The utter and well-
founded contempt in which the experienced news-
paper-man holds 99 per cent, of politicians is too
deep to be expressed in words.
There are exceptions both as to the men and as
to the Occasions, but, these be the general rules.
Instead of being “all beer and skittles” a re-
porter’s life is one “demnition grind,” until after
years of badly-paid toil, should he be lucky and
live, he secures a prize sinecure, and makes others
drag round the grindstone ; or, until he reaches
that commonplace, uninteresting yet placid haven
of shattered ambitious, a country editorship, and
slowly saturates himself to the last and stillest
haven of all, in muddled complacency, varied with
interludes of vermilion fantods. Sometimes, how-
ever, he hasn’t even the cash to get any fantods.
Only the other day a man convicted of forging an
order for third-rate board and lodging, and sent to
gaol for six months, deposed that he had been
editing a N.S.W. country journal for 10s. a week
and his keep—for less than the stipend of a potato-
peeler in a sailor’s eating-house.
The prizes of a journalistic career are for
the few—for the mediocre man, generally, who
is steady and saving and servile; not for the
brilliant but erratic genius, who is generally a
generous and often a reckless spendthrift—a
philanthropist to all save himself, and, if he be
married, his wife and family. Let me apprentice
CrammUm to the noble craft of what is called, but
really te not, “journalism.”
* * #
He who aims at becoming a good, all-round
newspaper-man should commence at the “case”
the typesetter’s “frame.” Intelligent eofii-
positors who afterwards deVelope the literary
instinct are the moat Valuable Wen <t newspaper—
especially a country newspaper—knows. The
apprenticeship means, at least, five years of
drudgery and stewing in a murky room, amid
yellow, smoky, gas-jets, or dazzled by the garish,
steel-blue, eye-paralysing glitter of the electric
light five years (most probably) of night-work—
five years of no-holidays—and, if the compositor
has a soul above his “ frame,” five years of study,
though an intelligent experience of a newspaper
printing-room is an education in itself. These
five years will, however, supply all the technical
knowledge that is requisite afterwards to escape
the lurid cursings of the “comps,” and to avoid the
.expense involved by ignorance of technicalities
and consequent blundering,
Speaking of .education, overmuch education Is
not required in a newspaper-man. Your univer-
sity dux is almost always a duffer on a newspaper.
Learn the native tongue—in our oaso, English,
Latin and Greek and dead languages generally
are only of the smallest service. Newspaper-
readers don’t want them, can’t understand them
for the most part, and, when they can understand
them, despise the writer as a pedantic showman,
French and German are far more useful, but only
that you may exchange ideas with newspapers
printed in those tongues. Learn English—that is
the essential. There are now about 250,000 words in
the English language, of which the ordinary
Briton knows and uses about 10 000. Learn
100,000 in addition, and then go right ahead.
The ordinary reporter has only about twice the
vocabulary of an Australian blackfellow and never
makes any progress in consequence. His two
dull, bald-headed flowers of rhetoric consist 111
saying that a man is “launched into eternity”
when he means that he is hanged, and in alluding
to a fire in a rag-shop as “the devouring element.”
Suppose, however, that Crammum is too high-
toned to defile his fingers with printer’s ink as a
practical compositor. He should, at the very
least, start as an assistant reader, the lowest rung
of the literary ladder. A year at this, if it doesn’t
kill him, should qualify him to become a full-
fledged reader, and give him an inner-circle know-
ledge of the working mechanism of a newspaper.
He can also take an oc asional chance to report
an unimportant occurrence, and so get his hand
in. Then he attacks shorthand and type-writing.
A terribly hard year’s toil, this. A reader’s hours
generally range (on a morning newspaper) from
7 p.m. (sometimes as early as 4 p.-m.) until 3 or 4
or 5 o’clock next morning, with a desperate plunge
at a gobbled sandwicli about midnight. Wages:
Reader, from £2 10s. to £4 par week, according to
the status of the paper; assistant, from £1 to £2.
* * #
I now promote Crammum to a junior-
reportership, and take him on the staff at £2 per
week.
He is the reporting rouseabout. All the driest,
most sickening, most insignificant “engage-
ments’’fall to his lot. His only relief is in the
Police-court; he does see some fun there and, I
am deeply pained to say, ho indulges in small and
sinful romances there as well. When lie reports
that “ Anno Smith, a prepossessing young woman,
neatly attired,” was charged witli larceny, it is
s ife to bet that ho is badly “ gone ” upon Anne
Smith, and takes a deep interest in that tearful
creature. The present writer speaks from experi-
ence, To him that bright though erring maiden,
Anne Smith, was a vision that will never entirely
fade away. Then sometimes Crammum gets hold
of a sensation and works it up with an enthusiastic
frehity. He seldom gets ptaisfetl for it, although
his imaginative elaboration sells hundreds of extra
copies of the paper. His virtue is its own reward.
But he is enthusiastic, he is capable and promis-
ing, and he is a glutton for work. He gets tons of
it, and helps to make a fortune for the man who
pays him a miserable screw. Here is a sample
day Office at 9.30 a.m. to look at the “engage-
ment book” and initial his “engagements,” in
order to show that lie holds himself responsible to
supply a report of each ; 10 o’clock, Police-coni t;
12 o’clock, see coroner’s orderly and abridge, de-
positions of unimportant inquest; 3 o’clock, attend
building society’s meeting (no sensation or
tiothing but a fat man, with a voice like the hum
of a bumble-bee, reading acres of figures); 4 o’clock,
attend ordinary Weekly meeting of hospital
Committee; 7 o’clock, attend Wesleyan tea-
meeting and , subsequent speechifying, and con-
dense three hours’ stale buns and ghastly
drivel into 20 lines of print ; 10 o’clock,
the “rounds.” The “rounds” mean that ho
has to hunt up and report up n anything that
has happened during the day in the nature of
police oases, or casualties at the hospital, or inci-
dents at the fire-brigade station, or the morgue,
including epileptic fits, lost dogs, or anything else
that has an official outlet. In these days of tele-
phonic communication the “ rounds ” are much
lightened. In my junior reporting days I had to
rush round personally to the hospital, the central
police barracks, the detective office, the fire-
brigades, the dead-house, and other places, and
was received everywhere with a cold and arrogant
eye. The only joy to a junior then “doing the
rounds” was that he Would “foot it ’’regularly,
and conscientiously charge ’bus or cab-hire, thus
pocketing “exs.” as a welcome addition to his
meagre scicw.
Crammum has not been a reporter long before
his ideas of the English language are considerably
modified. He has to unlearn the polite and
elaborate style of the schools, and to acquire
“ newspaper English,” with its inflexible idioms.
This branch of the subject, however, requires a
chapter to itself.
Crammum soon gets an idea of the incompressi-
bility of “ space,” and learns to gauge the “ news-
paper value ” of events. The sub-editor often
hands him back two columns of his enthusiastic
brain cobweb, with the curt instruction, petu-
lently growled—“ Boil that down to a-third of a
column.” 'I his perhaps at 11 p.ra., and he hasn’t
had a bite since breakfast.
But his era of glory comes at last. He becomes
a recognised reliable shorthand-writer, and his
descriptive writing “takes.” Now, he slaves in
the Parliamentary gallery, hobnobs with hon.
members, attends deputations, and interviews
Ministers, goes to banquets and receptions, gets
glorious country trips, dress-suits it at the theatres
only to find that these much-envied pursuits
have no charm for him, but are all the same
solemn grind of the same solemn grindstone. The
hardened reporter would make, notes of a dog-
fight or a general resurrection with the same
funereal impassibility. He has lost the capacity
for enjoyment. Besides, the intimacy with the
“ great ones ” is all hollow, and the “Personages ”
really regard him as a flunkey, though they treat
him with (sometimes cold and sometimes cordial)
politeness. Still, he lias mounted a few rungs
higher. Always supposing that by this time, he
has not become a confirmed drunkard, and got the
kick-out from about 17 offices.
The talented drunkard becomes a flaneur, whose
manuscript is accepted at the offices where his
personal presence is voted a nuisance. However,
he is 110 slave at the beck and call of any task-
master ; he follows his own erratic promptings
and gets lots of “fun,” followed by lots of
“horrors.” He is generally buried on the cheap
at the sloppy end of the cemetery, and has no
tombstone, and leaves nothing behind him but
old broken pipes and bad debts.
But Crammnm isn’t that sort. He is steady
and reliable, and becomes leader of the reporting
staff in the course of years, and makes the juniors
grind at the mill as ho had to do, takes all the
creamy “engagements” himself, and calmly puts
in his own name as “among the distinguished
personages present on the occasion.” Nevertheless,
he is personally responsible for the staff’s work, and
ho is always being ear-pulkd by the irate pro-
prietor, or editor, or managing-director, with the
“sack ” grimly looming in the distance.
Perhaps Crammum slips gently on to a Han-
SABD-stafl —which is certainly a billet for life, but
nothing more. There, he simply vegetates and dis-
appears from public glory, and the balance of his
existence is spent copying the dull, flabby speeches
of the man with the iron jaw and the fat-headed
member who wants the Bible read in schools. Or,
he becomes sub-editor, bullied by the editor and
himself bullying the reporters. Crammnm now
finds that he has longer hours in his hot and
stuffy room than he had when he was reader. His
“screw ” is better, but his responsibilities are ten
times heavier than his “screw”—which varies,
according to the status of the “rag,’’from £5 to
£9 per week. He is responsible for everything—
errors in the editorials, any “ slummoeky ” work
on the part of the reporters ; errors in cablegrams,
wrong spelling, wrong punctuation, a mistake, in
some old Sanscrit quotation, a wrong date on some
event that happened 1200 years ago, or a blunder
about the policy of the leader of the Opposition in
Bulgaria—all these mishaps are passed on to the
devoted sub. He has to know more than Solomon
and Moses and the seven wise men of Greece, and
never to be tired.
Perhaps Crammnm becomes at last “ The
Editor.” More likely he doesn’t. If he does, it
is his turn to do as little as he can for as big a
salary as he can get. He pays his “leader-
writers” per article, and they are only too
glad to take all they can earn. He has, of
course, to pen one or two editorials a week
himself, and generally to “put in his time.”
But only one reporter out of 50 reaches this
height of “Wc-dom” (copyright). The odds
against Crammnm are too many.
If Crammun proves himself only a mediocre
journalist he becomes a country editor. If he has
saved money or gets a windfall, ho buys a country
paper, and becomes a local magnate. But the
hired country editor has a poor, if placid life.
His eloquence sheds lustre on the big turnip, the
double-headed calf, the snake story, and on the
enterprise of his best advertiser the soulless local
storekeeper. He is never beard of outside his own
domain of three selections and a gully, but he
gets free drinks and dies of alcoholic pleurisy and
Bright’s disease.
Such is journalism, Crammum. Are its chances
inviting enough to allure you from the fields of
tuition? Is it worth going for? Had I a son I
would sooner make him a bricklayer than a
journalist. Law, medicine, holy orders, architec-

The native question was, at latest aclvices>
unsolved in New Guinea. Some trader had
visited the interior with a rifle and an assortment
of glass beads, and the natives slew him and ate
him. Then the whole Government stall left oil
fanning itself, and got up, and sallied forth on a
punitive cum*exploratory expedition and caught
two savages with skewers through _ their noses
somewhere in the “disturbed district. Some
other native having been understood to say that
they were the guilty nig?, they were hauled along
to Port Moresby and put in the local prison, it
was then that unforeseen troubles harassed the
course of British justice. Somebody gave a teed
of cold pork and pickles to one of the prisoners,
and the unusual diet settled him before his case
same on. It struck him about where his waistcoat
ought to have been, and he curled up and died.
He had scarcely reached the golden shore when it
was discovered that the other nig. was suffering
from a peculiarly horrible kind of leprosy, so the
authorities entered a nolle prosequi against him.
They did it by opening the prison door and crying
“ Shoo ! ” through the window until the leper fled
to his native wilds. Then they fumigated the
gaol and adjourned the Criminal Sessions.
Lady Burton was offered 6000 guineas for
the MS. of her deceased husband’s translation of
an Arabic work, entitled “The Scented Garden,
said to have been made for “ scientific and
psychological purposes.” Lady Burton refused
the offer, and, believing that most men would read
the work for “filth’s sake,” declared that she
wouldn’t have it preserved for six millions of
guineas. “Sorrowfully, reverently, and in fear
and trembling,” said she, “I burnt sheet after
sheet, until the whole of the volumes were con-
sumed.” A heated controversy is still proceeding
over the matter. Thus Robert Buchanan :
On the same plea as hers, a Roman Catholic wife might
consider herself justified in destroying a masterpiece
written to expose the evils of Roman Catholicism ; or a
Protestant daughter, left heiress of a Roman Catholic
father’s unwihlished writings, might suppress and burn a
work from' the Romish point of view. In either case,
there would be a sincere desire to save the beloved one
from eternal damnation, to “cut the cords which pie-
vent his poor soul from “ ascending to Heaven. ’ Now,
questions of Morality are far more difficult to determine
than questions of dogmatic Religion, and little or no good
is gained by the Podsnapian method of putting all such
questions aside as “offensive,” “improper, 1 ‘ not to he
discussed by decent people.” , , v
“ No man can save another s Soul,
Or pay another’s debt.”
says the poet; and if Sir Richard Burton left a base book
as his legacy to mankind, no post-mortem action on the
part of his wife could save or absolve him. We who
plead for freedom of individual expression, however, deny
the right of any person to tamper with literature and to
set aside the will of a great personality. We decline to
let the voice of homely virtue or superstitious prejudice
penetrate to our death-chambers. Had Sir Richard
Burton said to his wife —“Here is a book—but you must
decide whether or not it is fit for publication,” the matter
would have been very different. He gave her no s ich
choice. In burning the work of his mature and deliberate
creation, and in afterwards announcing to the world that
she had done so because the work was foul, she stultified
her own devotion and she stigmatised its object in the
eyes of all mankind.

Bank has been merged- into that of the Sydney
Deposit Bank, and under the able management of
Mr. T. S. Richardson, the General Manager, con-
tinued success is assured. The latest development
in banking has been promulgated by the Sydney

The History of a Jackeroo.
IN FIVE LETTERS.
NO. I.
Letter from Joscelyn de Greene, of Wiltshire, Eng-
land, to College friend.
Deah Gus, —The Governor has fixed things up for
me at last. lam not to go to India, but to Aus-
tralia. It seems the Governor met some old Aus-
tralian swell named Moneygrub at a dinner in the
City. He has thousands of acres of land and
herds of sheep, and I am to go out and learn the
business of sheep-raising. Of course it is not
quite the same as going to India; but some really
decent people do go out to Australia sometimes, I
am told, and I expect it won’t be so bad. In
India one generally goes into the Civil Service,
nothing to do and lots of niggers to wait on you,
but the Australian Civil Service no fellow can
well go into—it is awful low business, I hear. _ I
have been going in for gun and revolver practice
so as to be able to hold my own against the
savages and the serpents in the woods of Aus-
tralia. Mr. Moneygrub says there isn’t much
fighting with the savages nowadays; but, he says,
the Union shearers will give me all the fight I
want. What is a Union shearer, I wonder ? My
mother has ordered an extra-large artist’s umbrella
for me to take with me for fear of sunstroke, and
I can hold it over me while watching the flocks.
She didn’t half like my going until Mr. Moneygrub
said that they always dressed for dinner at the
head station, and that a Church of England
clergyman visits there twice a month. I am
only to pay a premium of £5OO for the experience,
and Mr. Moneygrub says I’ll be able to make
that out of scalps in my spare time. He says
there is a Government reward for scalps. I don’t
mind a brush with the savages, but if he thinks
I’m going to scalp my enemies he is mistaken.
Anyhow, I sail next week, so no move from yours,
outward bound, Joscelyn de Greene.

Manager of the Company's “ Dryhone ”
Station, Paroo River, Australia.
Dear Sir, —We beg to advise you of having
made arrangements to take a young gentleman
named Greene as colonial-experiencer, and he will
be consigned to you by the next boat. His
premium is £5OO, and you will please deal with
him in the usual way. Let us know when you
have vacancies for any more colonial-experiencers,
as several are now asking about it, and the
premiums are forthcoming. You _ are on no
account to employ Union shearers this year ; and
you must cut expenses as low as you can. Would
it not be feasible to work the station with the
colonial-experience men and Chinese labour? &c.,

Letter from Mr. Robert Saltbush, of Fryingpan
Station, to a friend.
Dear Billy, —Those fellows over at Drybqne
Station have been at it again. You know it joins
us, and old Moneygrub, who lives in London,
sends out an English bloke every now and again
to be a jackeroo. He gets £5OO premium for each
one, and the manager puts the jackeroo to boun-
dary-ride a tremendous great paddock at the back
of the run, and he gives him a week’s rations
and tells him never to go through a gate, because
so long as he only gets lost in the paddock lie can
always be found somehow, but if he gets out of
the paddock, Lord knows whether he’d ever be
seen again. And there these poor English devils
are, riding round the fences and getting lost and
not seeing a soul until they go near mad from
loneliness; and then they run away at last, and
old Macgregor, the manager, he makes a great fuss
and goes after them with a whip, but he takes
care to have a stockman pick their tracks up and
take them to the nearest township, and then they
go on the spree and never come back, and old
Moneygrub collars the £5OO and sends out
another jackeroo. It’s a great game. The
last one they had was a fellow called Greene.
They had him at the head station for a while,
letting him get pitched off the station horses. He
said: “They’re awfully beastly horses in this
country, by Jove; they’re not content with throw-
ing you off, but they’d kick you afterwards if you
don’t be careful.” When they got full up of him
at the head station they sent him out to the big
paddock to an old hut full of fleas, and left him
there with his tucker and two old screws of horses.
The horses, of course, gave him the slip, and he
got lost for two days looking for them, and his
meat was gone bad when he got home. He killed
a sheep for tucker, and how do you think he killed
it? He shot it! It was a ram, too, one of Money-
grub’s best rams, and there will be the deuce to
pay when they find out. About the fourth day a
swagman turned up, and he gave the swaggy a
gold watch-chain to show him the way to the
nearest town, and he is there now—on the spree, I
believe. He had a fine throat for whisky, any-
how, and the hot climate has started him in
earnest. Before he left the hut and the fleas, he
got a piece of raddle and wrote on the door :
HELL.
S.R.O.
whatever that means. I think it must be some
sort of joke. The brown colt I got from Ginger is
a clinker, a terror to kick, but real fast. He takes
a lot of rubbing out for half a mile, &c., &c., &o.

Letter from Sandy M‘Gregor, manager of Dryhone
Station, to Messrs. Moneygrub & Co., London,
Dear Sirs, —I regret to have to inform you
that the young gentleman, Mr. Greene, whom you
sent out, has seen fit to leave his employment and
go away ti the township. No doubt he found
the work somewhat rougher than he had been
used to, but if young gentlemen are sent out here
to get experience they must expect to rough it
like other bushmen. I hope you will notify his
friends of the fact: and if you have applications
for any more colonial experiences we now have a
vacancy for one. There is great trouble this year
over the shearing, and a lot of grass will be burnt
unless some settlement is arrived at, &c., &c., &c.

Extract from evidence of Senior-constable Rafferty,
taken at an inquest before Lushington, P.M.
for the North-east by South Paroo distinct, and
a jury.
I am a senior-constable, stationed at Walloopna
beyant. On the 6th instant, I received informa-
tion that a man was in the horrors at Flanagan’s
hotel. I went down and saw the man, whom I
recognise as the deceased. He was in the horrors:
lie was very bad. He had taken all his clothes
off, and was hiding in a fowl-house to get away
from the devils which were after him. I went to
arrest him, but he avoided me, and escaped over
a paling-fence on to the Queensland side of the
border, where I had no power to ax-rest him. He
was foaming at the mouth and acting like a mad-
man. He had been on the spree for several days.
From enquiries made, I believe his name "o be
Greene, and that he had lately left the emiUy-
rnent of Mi-. Macgregor, at lirybone. He was
found dead on the roadside by the carriers coming
into Walloopna. Ho had evidently wandered
away from the township, and died from the effects
of the sun and the drink.
Verdict of jury : “That deceased came to his
death by sunstroke and exposure during a fit of
delirium tremens, caused by excessive drinking.
No blame attached to anybody.” Curator of
intestate estates advertises for next of kin of
J. Greene, and nobody comes forward. Curtain !
THE BANJO.
During the winter season many persons of
means and who care not for the cold, migrate to
warmer climes, and the North of Queensland is
visited by numbers of colonists who cannot stand
the keener blasts of our own colony. There are
great numbers, however, who are not able to meet
the expense of such a trip, or who cannot leave
Sydney for business reasons. To these the advan-
tages of a sanatorium, in which they could, with-
out leaving the metropolis, enjoy all the benefits of
sea-bathing coupled with the comforts of a first-
class hotel, would be a boon indeed. Yet such a
combination is to be found at their very doors,
so to speak, and persons who would travel
hundreds of miles to be able to obtain a regular
course of sea-bathing at this period of the
year—if it were possible without the unpleasant-
ness of shivering in the cold ocean blasts—are
very frequently in ignorance of the fact. At the
Natatorium, in Pitt-strect, however, near to the
Haymarket, rheumatic subjects or invalids may
have their diurnal dip in sc a-water of a tempera-
ture of 95deg., newly-pumped from Port Jackson
throughout the day and heated by means of
steam. In the hotel connected with the baths,
which is one of the finest in the city, every
accommodation is provided for visitors, and in
addition to a first-class menu, there are all the
comforts of a home. Many persons already take
advantage of this fact, and the joint attractions
of the baths and the hostelry draw a constant
flow of new visitors to the establishment, which
is now under one control. The Sydney Bathing
Company are now reaping the well-earned reward
of their enterprise and good business-management
in this increase of business.
NOBODY WANTS THAT GOLD RING.
For nearly 100 years a certain family of working
people living in Paris have ended their lives by
suicide. From father to son, from mother to
daughter, has descended a plain gold ring, and on
the finger of every one of these suicides, as they
lay in death, this ring has been found. Only last
year the body of a young man who had killed
himself was brought to the Morgue, and on his
finger was the fatal golden circlet. He was the
last of his race. The ring was buried with the
corpse, from which no one acquainted with its
history will have the courage to remove it.
The mental taint in this family came from some
remote ancestor, and was intensified by their
recognition of it until it became a controlling
force ; and the ring was accepted as imposing upon
its possessor the obligation to commit suicide,
after the example of the person who last wore it.
This form of mania usually originates in a disorder
of the nervous system, which in its turn arises
from anmmia, or poverty of the blood, one of the
results of imperfect nutrition.
A recent letter from a gentleman living in Nor-
folk contains the following assertion: “ I longed
for death ; I was afraid of the night; I was afraid
to he alone, yet I hated society. I teas afraid that
in some one of these hours oj deep gloom and depres-
sion I should lift my hand against my own life, for
I knew that many had done so from the same cause.”
The dark hours became a time of terror to him, so
he says. He tossed and tumbled on his bed,
wondering if morning would ever dawn again. In
this case it was not an accusing conscience, as he
had committed no offence ; the cause was purely
a physical one—yet, all too common in England—
indigestion and dyspepsia, with the long chain of
consequences dragging after it, nervous collapse
among them.
He relates that his skin and eyes had been more
or less discoloured for years, often of a ghastly
and repulsive yellow. This was due to the presence
of bile in the blood and tissues, where it had no
business to be. But as the weak and torpid liver
could not remove it, no other result was possible
than the one our friend experienced. His head
frequently ached as though fiends had turned it
into a workshop, and pains chased one another
through his body as though he had at least half
the maladies catalogued in the popular books of
disease.
Yet one thing, and one only, was responsible
for all the mischief, namely, the poison introduced
into the blood from the decaying food in the
stomach and intestines. The cold feet, the loss
of appetite and ambition, the mental despondency,
the sense of weariness and fatigue, the bad taste
in the mouth, dry cough, giddiness, palpitation,
chills, weakness, &c., are a brood of foul birds
hatched in one nest, and the mother is always
indigestion and dyspepsia.
Time passed somehow, as it always does,
whether we laugh or cry, and this man grew
heartily tired of a life thus burdened and spoiled.
He longed to see the end of it, and no wonder.
But the last page of his letter is pitched in a
higher key. He says, “When I think of what
I was, and what I am now, I can hardly realise
the change. For the past six months I have been
using a preparation known as Mother Seigel's
Curative Syrup, and it has actually revolutionised
my whole system. One of my tenants recom-
mended it to me, and I tried it just to please him.
Now I praise it for myself, and thank the men
who made and advertise it. My troubles are over,
and I feel (at 57) as light, elastic, and gay as a
boy on his summer vacation. I tell my doctors
they are beaten at their own trade by an old
German nurse, and so far as I am concerned they
can’t deny it. I have no more horrible thoughts
of self-destruction, for I find too much enjoyment
in living. My thanks are too deep for words.”
The author of this letter consents to the pub-
lication of so much of it as is here printed, but
declines to allow the use of his name, at least for
the present, for reasons we are bound to respect.
But the evident sincerity of his story will carry
conviction to every candid mind.

The Great Trousers Question.
The Executive Board of the United States
Women’s National Council has issued a decree
that on and after June 1, 1892, business women —
type-writers, sales-girls, cashiers, compositors,
and clerks —shall begin wearing trousers. It is
not clear how the Women’s National Council pro-
poses to enforce its decree. An attempt to force
a young lady into a pair of trousers against her
will would constitute an assault in law and might
be resisted. In prisons and hospitals refractory
inmates are thrust into strait-waistcoats in spite
of their struggles; but the conformation of the
garment which is usually regarded as exclusively
masculine opposes difficulties which could not be
easily overcome in the case of a lady. For this, if
for no other reason, a court would bo slow to issue
a writ of mandate requiring a lady to don the
breeches ; it is against public policy for courts to
issue orders which cannot be executed. The
decree of the council must be regarded as merely
advisory and not mandatory.
It must be assumed that, before taking their
stand on the trousers question, the members of
the council had satisfied themselves* that the bulk
of their constituents were in favour of a change;
that female-workers are eager to borrow from
men their nether garments, as their fashionable
sisters have already borrowed male hats, coats,
waistcoats and shirts. In this light we can see
that the unwritten law, which has abolished a
multiplicity of skirts and substituted a maillot,
may have been a premonition of a further
approach toward uniformity of dress between the
sexes. It may, perhaps, be regarded as
typical of the determination of women to
a sort the absolute equality of the txo halves
of mankind. It is said of a man who is hen-
pecked that his wife wears the bi'eeches. May
this movement be notice to husbands that they
are all hereafter to belong to the hon-pecked class
—without always having the privilege of choosing
the hen ?
Whatever the true inwardness of the impending
revolution may be, it will not encounter much
opposition from men. Trousers are a wide insti-
tution, in which there is room for both sexes. If
the darlings want them, they may have them and
welcome. They have plenty of example for covet-
ing the forked garment. To say nothing of the
disciples of Mrs. Bloomer and Mrs. Swisshelm in
this country, and the shining precedent set by
Dr. Mary Walker, more than one-half the women
of the world are wearing trousers at this moment.
An Asiatic or a Turkish lady, or a lady from
North Africa, would no sooner go out without
her trousers than a gentleman would walk down
Market-street in like dishabille. She may flirt
with her tunic, and her undershirt, and her robe,
and her short skirt and flounces, doff or don them
as her fancy and the weather suggests ; but she
would rather die than take off her trousei’s. They
are the base of her costume. In China she sleeps
in them ; she would probably do so in Turkey,
likewise, but that it is the fashion in that unspeak-
able country to go to bed without any clothes at
all.
Whether trousers are more comfortable than
skirts is a question which cannot bo answered,
because there is no one living who has had suffi-
cient experience of both to decide. It would take
a modern Tiresias to solve the problem. But
unless our conceptions of the lines of beauty are
warped by habit, men will agree that the skirt is
more be oming to a woman than the male gar-
ment. No one ever admires a lady in a Turkish
or a Circassian costume at a fancy ball. She is a
nondescript, and the beholder is impelled to be-
seech tier to dispense with one of her two sets of
apparel. As old Gascoigne said ;—
“ What be they? women? masking in men’s weeds?
With dutchkin doublets, and with jerkins jagged?
With Spanish spangs, and ruffs fet out of France?
With high-capt hats, and feathers (limit a-flaunt?
They be so, sure, even Wo to man indeed.”
Still, if the fashion of trousers once gets a foot-
hold, it will not be checked by considerations of
what appears for the hour to be becoming. The
eye is quickly educated to changes of costume.
Twenty-five years ago, a woman who did not wear
a bell-hoop was laughed at. Everybody remembers
Leech’s inimitable caricatures of Miss La Jeunc,
who would hot wear hoops. Now a lady in a
wide-fitting hoop would be followed by the boys
in the street. A hundred and eighty years ago
Addison described a fashionable lady who was
arrested* and ordered to be brought into court.
She declared that she had tried two or three times
to come in, but could not, by reason of the size of
the petticoat she wore, which could not be
squeezed through the door. It was necessax-y to
impaixel a special jury of matrons to remove so
much of her costume as impeded her entrance,
•without shocking her modesty. She was acquitted,
but in endeavouring to return home with the
obnoxious hoop on, she fell, whereupon the essayist
declared that her prostrate form presented the
appearance of a bell without a clapper. Eighty
years after that, ladies of fashion wore skirts so
limp and scanty that they impeded the action in
walking. Mine. Recamier’s skirts wx-apped
tightly round her beautiful limbs. Taste changes,
like public opinion, and no one can say that in the
year 1909 a well-dressed girl may not be one in
well-fitting trousers, tight at the knee and clinging
closely round the body from the waist down.
An actress in the costume of a page always
looks mis-shapen. But that is because our eye is
accustomed to see forked raiiyent on a masculine
figure, moulded to masculine proportions.
Sculptors generally consider the female form
more artistically perfect than the male. The
curves arc more harmonious and the general effect
more pleasing. If that is so, it is prejudice
begotten of custom which offends the eye when a
well-proportioned woman appears in public in
male attire, and, after people’s taste had been
educated to the change, they would rebel against
a reactionary movement that threatened to hide
so much loveliness from inference.
When Mrs. Bloomer devised the costume which
bears her name, which consisted of a pair of
trousers and a Very short skirt, it was satirized all
over the world, and a good many women who were
disposed to relieve the sex of the dragging weight
of many skirts were bullied into rejecting it. But
most of the criticisms were the work of men to
whom female underclothing must always be a
mystery. The blow which killed the reform in
England was a sentence in the London Times,
written by a male ignoramus. He said: “The
bloomer dress is very pretty, no doubt; but we
should like to see a woman who wore it pick up a
pin.”— Aikjonaut.

leave without my husband,” protested one lady as
the third boat was lowered. “ Make yourself
easy, my dear madam,” was the answer, “ he left
by the first boat.”
A voice cried from the grave at Port
Arthur, Tas., the other day. Some workmen who
were pulling down the seats in the Modern Prison
Chapel, found behind the panelling a prisoner’s
letter, written apparently to the Commandant.
Here are some extracts :
I ask you it you were to gasp your last to night, could
you, in your last moments, die with any composure with
the thoughts of not only dozens, hut perhaps scores of
unfortunates who have sworn to revenge, to murder both
you and your family, with that little hoy who calls you
papa; that the innocent must suffer for your bloody
tyranny? If you had any respect for your pom - children
when you are gone, surely you would act with justice.
Does the little present repay you for all the evil which
will come on you and yours sooner or later? You ought
to be ashamed of yourself; you are none the better
for your tyranny and severity. Why not change, and
let not so many of your fellow creatures seek
anil cry for your blood and the blood of your
children? Many are the changes in life. You
may yet he reduced lo poverty, if it is true what the
Bible says, “ lie that thinketh he standeth take heed lest
he fall,” and “ Whatsoever you sow that shall you reap.”
For my part I believe there is neither God, devil, heaven,
nor hell. . . . But this is nothing (o the question’
you are a tyrant . . . Your dear little hoy who calls
you papa, the innocent of your heart, you are bringing
him up to pay for your tyranny and oppression, but
. . . it will come home to you and yours sooner or
later. My four years will soon wear away, and then you
may look out for squalls.
The letter is long, and becomes more and more
vigorously abusive of all the officials, charging
them with peculation and other misconduct. The
genuineness of this letter is vouched for by Rev.
J. B. Woolnough, now living at the then Hell-
upon-Earth. And the writer ! what of him ?
Did he ever “do” his remaining four years, or,
driven by a maddening system to some rash deed,
die at the hands of the tyranny ?
“THE BULLETIN.”
(Published at SYDNEY, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia's Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
T h e Has ulleti el,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dis
tinctive Australian National Policy.
T\e Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
Payment of Members,.
One Pc rson, one Vote.
State Revenue derived directly from the Land.
Complete Secularisation of State Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australa and Protection against
the World.
The Bulletin denounces—
Religious Interference i.i Politics.
Foreign Titles.
r i he Chinese.
Imperial Federation.
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started eleven years ago with no capital but brains,
ar.d has become a vast property, because it pos-
sesses a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once bo seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin's inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success ir
Australian journalism, the one completely non
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form —printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has over seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress; it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now alflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the New Zealand
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

SWOK\ CERTIFICATE. —One of Thousands more.
Noble-street, Newton, Geelong,
10th December, 1888.
To H. F. Kuoblmann, Esq.
Dear Sir,—This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. I consulted,
more than one doctor, and during that time took a great
quantity of medicine without it doing me the slightest
good, but I became worse every day, roasting away until
I became a perfect skeleton. About February last I began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I
was expectoratingevery day, I became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. I agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. At the
•nd of three months I was taken bad one morning, and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time I commenced to improve, and
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, I am as well as ever.
P. KEEN AN.

Justices of the Peace, for the Southern Bailiwick, in the
