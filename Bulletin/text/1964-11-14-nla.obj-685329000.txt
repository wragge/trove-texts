TOYOTA have built the Lite-Stout for those who want a
really tough, hard-working, truck-size ute that has sedan
car comfort for three passengers—truly rugged but refined.
Utilities made from passenger cars just can’t carry the
truck-type loads like the TOYOTA Lite-Stout—its big load
area carries more than a ton. TOYOTA’S tough 65 B.H.P.
engine is really reliable—with lots of torque low down to
pull the big loads easily.
Under normal working conditions, loaded to capacity,
Lite-Stout gives up to 28 miles per gallon—32 m.p.g. on
light loads. The big brakes with finned drums give more
braking and less fade under heavy loads than any truck
at any price.
Easy handling, panoramic curved windscreen and passen-
ger car ride bring an entirely new feel to truck driving.
At only £1,058, TOYOTA toughness in the chassis, solid
reliability in the motor, economy on the go, Lite-Stout
gives you more for your money than any utility on the road
today.
m
See your TOYOTA dealer—he has what you want in trucks
TOYOTA Lite-Stout is available with either steel tray
(List Price £955 plus tax), wooden tray (List Price £965
plus tax) or cab and chassis (List Price £BB5 plus tax).
Girder-type chassis makes Lite-Stout especially suitable
for mounting special bodies.

National Notebook
Makeba Aftermath
abrupt departure of Miriam
Makeba from Chequers nightclub,
in Sydney, halfway through her season,
took the spotlight off the singer who has
been called “The Voice of Africa”, and
put it on the South African colony here.
It is probable that most Australians
assume that South Africans who come
here to live do so to escape living under
a Government whose policies they bitter-
ly oppose. This assumption is regarded by
liberal-minded South Africans as laugh-
ably naive. Looking over their compa-
triots here they are inclined to think that
about 10 per cent may be opposed to
Verwoerd. The others have left South
Africa simply because they want to get
out before the whole thing blows up.
Many of these are almost entirely in-
different to apartheid, and some of them
actively support the present Government.
Miss Makeba was released from her
contract with Chequers after producing
a doctor’s certificate saying she was suf-
fering from hepatitis. There seems no
doubt that she was sick. However, it has
been persistently reported that Miss
Makeba left Australia because she had
been constantly heckled during her act
and that remarks such as, “Go home,
kaffir,” were passed.
Chequers insist that there was no
organised heckling. A spokesman said
that one person had asked Miss Makeba
to “sing some songs in English” simply
because he wanted to hear songs he
could understand.
A spokesman for Chequers said that
the club had felt Miss Makeba was a
wonderful artist but “too good for night-
clubs”. They had felt she was hyper-
sensitive about race. “If someone in the
audience sneezed she would regard it as
an insult to her,” he said.
However, South Africans living here
who met Miss Makeba, who saw her
act and who walked about Sydney’s
streets with her, insist that the insul-
ting behavior was not all a figment of
her imagination.
As a sequel to the Makeba incident,
Mrs C. Stanford, of Killara, who wrote
to “The Sydney Morning Herald” pro-
testing about the treatment of the singer,
said that the morning after the letter was
published she received insulting tele-
phone calls.
Mrs Stanford said that she had come
to Australia from South Africa two years
ago, to escape, she said, the tensions of
life there and because she did not
approve of apartheid. “I now regard
myself as an Australian, and as an Aus-
tralian feel I have the right to write to
a newspaper setting out my views with-
out being attacked for doing so,” she
said.
South African opponents of Verwoerd
living here regard the Makeba incident
and its aftermath as further indications
that an organisation is being set up, or
already exists, to harass South Africans
in Australia who are opposed to the
present Government and to try in various
ways to gain support among Australians
for the Verwoerd Government’s policies.
Liberal South Africans cannot yet be
sure whether it has been necessary to
send people from South Africa to set
up this organisation, or whether there
"Now get out there and give 'em hell."
are plenty of apartheid supporters in
this country willing to do the job them-
selves.
Test Ride
r I ''he Australian bicycle market will
experience its first rise in tem-
perature for many years when a new
type of machine, the Moulton, goes on
sale in the New Year. This bicycle was
invented in the late 1950 s by an English-
man, Alex Moulton, who is also the
inventor of the suspension systems of the
Mini Minor and the Morris 1100. It
embodies the first radical changes in
bicycle design for generations, notably
in having small, 16-inch wheels, and a
crossbar that is only 18k inches from
the ground, so that the one frame serves
riders of either sex from the age of about
10 upwards.
But the revolutionary feature of the
Moulton is that it is sprung. There is
telescopic springing on the front wheel,
and a suspension system of the trailing-
link type on the back. The sprung wheels
reduce shock levels to half those trans-
mitted by conventional bicycles.
The advantages of the Moulton are
impressive. The small wheels reduce

for better manoeuvrability. The spring-

the tyres to be pumped to high pressures

low height of the crossbar and its
luggage-rack extension at the back
means that loads can be carried without
raising the centre of gravity and un-
balancing the machine.

At his suggestion we got onto a Moulton.
He mounted another and together we
went for a brisk ride round the factory
precincts, the object of many interested
glances. We were on a “Stowaway”
model, which can be folded and put
into the boot of a car or the stowage
space of a light aircraft.
Mr Castles directed us to a “horror
stretch”, and we pedalled blithely
through it with no more than an agree-
able tremor. It was different from the
bone-shaking rides of childhood. We

Is your budget small enough for it?
Mile for mile, the VW is probably the
cheapest car in the world to own.
Not because it’s cheaply made (quite
the contrary, it's expensive) but because
it’s sensibly designed in the first place.
It has big wheels, and since the tyre
rubber touches the road a lot less often
than in cars with small wheels, natur-
ally you get about double the mileage
from a single set.
Forty thousand miles isn’t unusual.
The VW engine is in the rear, over the
drive wheels, so you don’t have a heavy
transmission tunnel taking the power
from front to back.
The engine is cooled by air, not water,
so you don’t have a heavy water jacket,
or a radiator, or water hoses that perish
and break.
It’s a slow-revving engine, which means
it doesn’t wear fast and you spend prac-
tically nothing on engine repairs. You
don’t use oil between changes.
In fact, when you own a Volkswagen,
you find it so reliable you don’t think of
how much it costs, but how little. So if
you have a small budget, you can make
it travel thou-
sands of miles
further.

Afterwards Mr Castles told us that

bicycle business for years, and I’ve never
seen anything like it.” With an expectant
look in his eyes he prophesied the Moul-
ton’s true destiny. “This could put the
adult back on the bicycle,” he said.
Business As Usual
Tt appears to be book censorship as
usual under the new Minister for
Senator Ken Anderson, who
took over from Senator Henty three
months ago. Departmental officers expect
no radical changes and the Minister’s
view is that he is “only administering the
Act”.
Senator Anderson has been in politics
since 1950, but Customs is his first port-
folio. He lives in Denistone, a suburb
:on Sydney’s other North Shore, and thus
refutes the theory that Customs Ministers
ire for preference chosen from States
other than NSW.
In his three months Senator Ander-
son hasn’t been lucky, or unlucky,
enough to come up against a Lady
|Chatterley or a Lolita which would
make his name a household word and
his face appear on every television screen.
However, he is already experiencing the
exasperation that seems to gc with
Customs. “Here is a large Government
department,” he told us, “which is
i responsible for collecting 25 per cent of
the Commonwealth’s revenue and ad-
ministering 30 Acts of Parliament, and
no one, none of you journalists, ever
talks to me about anything except book
censorship.”
Senator Anderson intimated that he
his job with the idea that “no
natter what the Minister for Customs
! loes he is not going to please everyone.”
“I am a politician,” Senator Anderson
said, “and a politician is supposed to be
someone who sits on the fence and keeps
his ear to the ground at the same time.
.And after keeping my ear to the ground
I would say that public opinion is more
strongly in favor of more rigid censor-
ship than of more liberal censorship.
But that doesn’t mean we are going to
have more rigid censorship. We think
the Act is working pretty well as it
stands.”
However, Senator Anderson will
hardly, one would imagine, have time to
examine all his Department’s prohibited
imports before he faces the electors on
December 5 as No. 2 on the Liberal’s
Senate ticket for New South Wales.
Bigger But Not Better
TI/Tr Yoshitaka Mikimoto placed two
' LTA lumps of sugar in his cup of black
tea at Menzies Hotel in Sydney, adjusted
his cultured-pearl tie bar to best advant-
age and told us that Australian cultured
pearls are too darn big. “It is most un-
wise to suggest that we of Mikimoto are
at all afraid of you of Australia competing
with us in the sale of cultured pearls.
We of Mikimoto welcome competition.
Anyway, Australian cultured pearls lack
lustre and good color so why should we
of Mikimoto worry?” he asked the ceil-
ing. “Another thing about your cultured
pearls,” he went on, now looking us
straight in the eye, “They are like one
or two other things in this country
bigger but not better than any others”.
Mr Mikimoto, one of the youngest-
looking 46-year-olds outside of Japan,
reminded us that it was his grandfather,
Mr Kokichi Mikimoto, who discovered
the secret of culturing pearls. “That
secret is still partly unknown to other
people. It has to do with plankton and
tides and temperatures and is a very
delicate and treasured thing. Your Aus-
tralian pearl culturers would be well
advised to explore this art more deeply”,
he added.
The secret has indeed proved a trea-
sure for the Mikimotos. “When my
grandfather died at 96 he was a million-
aire in pounds as well as yen,” Mr Miki-
moto told us. What was his grandfather
before he found out about culturing
pearls? “A noodle-maker”. We asked
Mr. Mikimoto what is the best color
for cultured pearls to be: white, golden,
pink or the so-called “black”? He said
Sydney matrons seeking the best could
discard all others except “silvery pink”
pearls. “Only about five per cent of our
saleable pearls are this color. It is very
rare and the most beautiful and, of
course, expensive.”

bulletin
80 Years Ago: November 1, 1884
Tn commenting upon the proposal of
* the Anglican Bishops, that the
general religious teaching provided for
by the 7th clause of the NSW Public
Instruction Act [which stipulates that
“general religious teaching” shall ex-
elude “dogmatical or polemical theo-
logy”] be extended and amplified so as
to become practically a sedulous in-
culcation of dogmatic theology, the
SM Herald besides objecting that
Roman Catholic teachers would refuse
to be made the instruments of what
would, were the Anglican Bishops
satisfied, be Protestant propagandism
argues that nobody could complain
of the Churches going so far as to
have the general religious teachings,
as embodied in the Scripture lessons,
fully taught. This is merely an asser-
tion. Everyone who dissents from the
doctrines embodied in the Scripture
lessons could complain, with justice,
of their children being indoctrinated
with teachings which they believe to
be not merely ur.true, but injurious to
the reasoning faculties of the young.
But probably no one, except extrem-
ists, will object. The more sensible and
philosophical among those parents will
probably be satisfied that, while it is
very difficult to twist a child’s mind to
really believe absurdities, it is happily
extremely easy, with all the influence
of natural sense and plain probabilities
working against such teachings, to
neutralise their effects and make them
instrumental in conveying to the young
just ideas of what is and what is not
absurd. Ten minutes’ table-talk in the
home circle, or mere contact with
everyday conversation, will amply
suffice to undo all the mischief at-
tempted to be wrought by the recital
of legendary romances, by teachers
who for the most part will be at little
pains to disguise their own scepticism
regarding what they are obliged to
teach. The world will continue to re-
volve around the sun despite the ex-
cathedra declarations of the priestly
caste and its lay helots.

"That's Carmichael our commitment to Malaysia, Shadbolt our commitment to Borneo, O'Toole our
commitment to Vietnam and Gribble our defence of the mainland."


PLAIN ENGLISH
Beyond the Wit of Australians?
A lthough it is well known that Aus-
, tralia is generous in its nominal
commitments to our allies, we have
been in no position to meet these com-
mitments in any significant way be-
cause, without either adequate num-
bers of volunteers or universal national
training, our services are absurdly
small. Even if we were in a position
to send a division overseas—which we
are not — a single epidemic or a single
setback to it, let alone a disaster,
would reduce us to comparative im-
potence. Yet despite these notorious
facts, despite outspoken demands for
the reintroduction of national service
by such organisations as the RSL, and
despite Australian troops being in
action against Indonesians in Malaya,
the public remains surprisingly
apathetic and the Government is doing
little to arouse the required sense of
urgency.
Whatever decisions the Government
may announce this week, almost cer-
tainly there will be no outright re-
introduction of universal national ser-
vice, and if, in the end, a few thousand
youths are called up because of failure
to find volunteers, there is no sign that
any thought-out scheme of national
service has been considered. The fact
that, even if some compromise type of
national service is adopted, several
months would be allowed to prepare
for the reception of conscripts shows
how slight is any official sense of
urgency.
Discussion of national service seems
always to be stalled by the two stand-
ard objections. The first, or military
objection, is that national service
would sap the combat strength of the
officers and NCOs. Why, it is asked,
should the services have to completely
reorganise to train many thousands of
men when an additional one or two
thousand a year are all that is needed
to keep a professional army ready for
combat? The second, or economic
objection, is that national service
would channel labor and capital away
from national development. Civilian
economic progress, it is pointed out,
has great military potential. What is
the good of having a big army if we
do not have the industries and trans-
port systems to service them?
Of the two objections, the military
has always been the less convincing,
since the services agree they urgently
need volunteers, the training of whom
would be just as great a strain on
military resources as the training of
conscripts. If they argue they do not
want large numbers of servicemen,
either volunteer or conscripted, then
they are, in the name of professional-
ism, simply announcing to the world
that Australia will be of little use to
its allies in the sort of war where
numbers are of the greatest importance
which means most of the con-
ventional wars that we are ever likely
to be involved in. The real reason for
the military hostility to national ser-
vice seems to be a mixture of plain
conservatism and professional pride.
The economic objection to national
service is a sounder one—although it
is open to the objection that some
sacrifice of national development is a
price that will simply have to be paid.
But it also shares a basic assumption
with the military objection the as-
sumption that the services must be seen
as completely separate from the com-
munity as a whole. The services see
things in this light because of pro-
fessionalism, the civilians because they
see the services as competitors for the
same men and capital and do not see
how the services can aid in the solu-
tion of civilian problems.
Thus, in fact, may be the basic
trouble with nearly all Australian
thinking about national service, and,
in this field, a country like Australia
may well look for guidance to a
country like Israel or, for that matter,
Indonesia, whose troops Australian
soldiers have been fighting in Malaya
countries in which this military-
civilian dichotomy does not exist on
any scale and where military services
are integrated into community life. It
is surely not beyond the wit of Aus-
tralians to devise a national service
scheme relatively similar to theirs.
In Australian terms such a scheme
would, above all, involve a drastic
rethinking of the whole problem of
teenage education and employment—
especially the problems of unskilled
and unemployed boys and girls. Here
an enlightened national service scheme
could be of the greatest value. A
starting point, for example, might be
to raise the school leaving age to 16
throughout the Commonwealth and,
at that age, give school-leavers the
option of embarking forthwith on a
two-year period of national service.
This would create a bridge ..for all
school-leavers leading them immedi-
ately into employment and breaking
the current hiatus of idleness par-
ticularly chronic in recent years with
girls between leaving schools and
finding jobs. On the other hand, those
who wished to continue at school or
enter civilian employment, could take
their service in any two years up to
the age of 21 and possibly after in
the case of those doing, for example,
apprenticeships or medical courses.
In other words the vital immediate
object of increasing the numbers of
servicemen should be integrated with
a programme aimed at long-term social
and economic benefits. To achieve
these, the national servicemen would
not only have to undergo intensive
military training in climates where our
future battles are likely to be fought,
but also continue education for civilian
life, including technical education for
those who see their futures in industry.
Such a scheme should also mitigate
the problem of the ever-increasing
numbers presenting themselves for
higher education. Not only would
national service cut back the numbers
wanting to go to universities and
thereby help solve quota problems,
it would also channel those unfitted
for higher education into careers best
suited to their abilities.
If, to the opportunities such a
scheme would offer to all teenagers to
get more education free of cost (indeed
they would be receiving payment), we
add the various social and economic
roles they could fill during national
service, the general benefit to the
country could be enormous. National
service personnel could spend part of
their time supplementing the work
force in seasonal employments, de-
veloping the North, helping under-
staffed police forces, and generally
acting as a reserve labor force.
But the basic point remains that
the idea of national service should not
be associated as it was in the past—
often rightly so—with wasted time but
with the solution of general educational
and economic problems. But this
involves more rethinking than seems
to have been involved in recent
defence decisions.


THIS AUSTRALIA
Profile of a Strike
MELBOURNE —lf the men who
run Victorian Labor can learn any-
thing, they may perhaps have learnt
that it is one thing to incite phlegmatic
Australians to demonstrations, but quite
another to incite Greek Cypriot migrants
whose traditions trace back to EOKA,
to General Grivas and to Archbishop
Makarios. For the outbreak of violence
at Festival Hall, Melbourne, which
marked the end of the General Motors-
Holden strike and which was aimed at
preventing the holding of the ballot
ordered by the ACTU Disputes Com-
mittee, could have ended in serious
injury or worse.
It is very doubtful, however, if the
ebullient Communist, Mr Laurie Car-
michael. who is less the mastermind than
the energumen behind all of these affairs,
is interested in learning anything of the
kind. For him, violent demonstrations
by “the masses” are not dangers to be
avoided but intoxicating opportunities to
be sought. Short, slight, intense, brittle,
he finds in “mass demonstrations” the
fulfilment of living.
Mr Carmichael w'as the subject of a
profile in the Communist “Guardian”
(October 22) entitled: “Who is Laurie
Carmichael?” It tells a lot about the
39-year-old demagogue who effectively
led 18,500 General Motors employees
into a stoppage which cost most of them
over £lOO in lost wages, gained absolutely
nothing, and which because it was
started when GM-H had at least five
weeks' supply of Holdens in hand
could not possibly have gained .anything
at all.
Carmichael was born in the Mel-
bourne industrial suburb of Coburg in
1925. His background, as recounted by
the “Guardian”, was “proletarian”. He
was born, it wrote, “of working class
parents into a childhood of which he
says: 'There was always the fear—or the
fact—of unemployment. There was an
atmosphere of bills that were mounting
up, of battling to make ends meet’.”
He went from Coburg State school
to Brunswick Technical school. He be-
came an apprentice fitter at the old
Dominion Can Co. at the age of 15.
Three years later he joined the Eureka
Youth League, the training school for
young Communists, and became its State
President in 1943. In January, 1944,
before his 19th birthday, he joined “the
Party”.
Exactly seven months later he “broke
his apprenticeship to join the RAAF”.
The “Guardian” adds at once that he led
“opposition to Dutch intervention against
Indonesia among Air Force men at
Tocumwal”.
After the war he resumed his member-
ship of the Eureka Youth League, which
awarded him its top Victorian position
in 1948. But defence establishments
seemed to have a fatal fascination for
him, and in the same year he took a job
at Williamstown Naval Dockyard. Two
years later he was convenor of the Amal-
gamated Engineering Union Shop Stew-
ards in the Dockyard. In 1955 “he was
a leader in the successful eight weeks
Dockyard Strike”. In 1956 he was the
key figure as secretary of the Shop Com-
mittee at the Dockyards. In 1958 he
was elected Secretary of the Melbourne
District Committee of the AEU, with
the support of Mr W. Butler of the Vic-
torian ALP Central Executive.
LAURIE CARMICHAEL
It was therefore a very experienced
figure who led 18,500 GM-H workers—
of whom fewer than 2000 belonged to
his own union into their five weeks’
disaster.
“Don't present me,” he said to the
“Guardian” reporter, “as if I was one-
sided,. interested in the wages struggle in
isolation from the wider issues.” On a
recital of the events which led to the
strike, GM-H employees could add a
fervent “Amen” to that disclaimer.
The GM-H strike began out of a mass
meeting of workers at the Fishermen’s
Bend plant on September 25. Carmichael
has claimed that he did not even know
that the meeting was on until a week
before—the 18th. He probably didn't.
He is a busy man. He had been the
most active figure in the “great march”
of September 15. But the GM-H meet-
ing offered a copybook opportunity of
launching a direct attack on “monopoly”
and he seized it.
On September 18 the foundrymen
employed at Fishermen’s Bend had a
meeting on the job around the question
of increased pay. They banned overtime
and decided to try to have a meeting of
all Fishermen’s Bend employees on the
following Friday, the 25th.
These were all members of the Vehicle
Builders’ Union. Here the mystery
GM-H STRIKERS SHOUT AT UNION LEADERS IN FESTIVAL HALL, MELBOURNE.


begins. Any action on their resolution
should have come from the Victorian
branch of this union. Furthermore, if
the union decided to support the foundry-
men in strike action, Melbourne THC
rules required it to notify that body so
that all of the unions likely to be in-
volved could be called together.
None of these things happened. On
Monday, the 21st, the foundrymen went
back to normal duties.
At this point a completely unofficial
meeting of Communist and Left-wing
union officials took place. They decided
to widen the dispute. On Wednesday,
September 23, Carmichael directed AEU
members at Fishermen’s Bend to par-
ticipate in Friday’s stop-work meeting.
Although this stop-work meeting was
alleged to have been called by the
Vehicle Builders’ Union, in fact it was
not. The VBU made no such decision.
Other unions were informed that a joint
meeting was to take place on the Friday.
"The General Motors-Holden strike was
a debacle. The trade union movement of
the country would be disgusted if I was
able to tell the full story."
—J. D. KENNY, Senior
Vice-President, ACTU.
Australasian Society of Engineers quickly
consulted its members. They wouldn’t
be in it. The meeting which no one had
called, which had not been authorised by
the Melbourne Trades Hall Council, and
which had not been authorised by the
Vehicle Builders’ Union, was then held
on the 25th.
Carmichael was given control of the
meeting by a compliant VBU official as
soon as it began. When VBU members
indicated that they wanted a chairman,
Carmichael obligingly appointed one,
giving “the nod” to the secretary of the
VBU, Jarrard. Carmichael addressed the
meeting on the blunders of the Bolte
Government, on decreased purchasing
power, increased fares, and proposed
that a demand should be made on GM-H
for a £3 increase for everybody. The
foundrymen were left for dead.
A VBU member at the meeting then
proposed that as the dispute at that
stage was largely centred around the
Foundry, this issue should be resolved
before the matter was widened. Car-
michael intimated to the VBU man that
he would be unwise to get in the way.
He created the impression that all that
Was necessary was for the men to show
.their militancy. If they did, they would
get £3 for everyone. They only had to
send a deputation to the management
which would quickly capitulate.
He put the two proposals —to confine
action to support for the foundrymen or
to support a general stoppage —to the
meeting by pointing towards the area on
the road where the largest collection of
men was gathered, and inviting those
who wanted £3 for everyone to move
there, and those who only wanted to
support the foundrymen, to move to
another spot. The location made it
virtually impossible to move, and in fact,
most men remained where they were.
The result: Carmichael’s proposal was
declared carried.
The deputation went to see the
management. Carmichael returned to
the microphone, declared that he had
been in touch by phone with the deputa-
tion, and that he proposed to make an
announcement. A VBU member in-
dicated that he was not entitled to make
an announcement on behalf of that
union. Carmichael then said that his
remarks were directed to AEU members
who were to attend a meeting at the
Festival Hall the following Monday
morning at 9.30 a.m. There would not
be more than 400 men in the AEU at
Fishermen’s Band. They would have
fitted into the ring at Festival Hall, with-
out the expense of hiring the entire
building.
The deputation never came back. The
men dispersed. All other employees,
other than AEU members, had no idea
of their position. No decision had been
taken by the meeting to go on strike,
and no decision had been taken for any
further meeting.
The next day newspapers carried news
reports that all GM-H members at
Fishermen’s Bend were on strike and
would have a meeting at Festival Hall
the following Monday. No one has been
able to establish that the VBU Executive
took any such decision!
It was not until October 1 (almost two
weeks after the Foundry overtime ban)
that the Melbourne THC took control
of the dispute and called for a mass
meeting at Festival Hall at 9 a.m. on
Monday, October 5. Prior to this
happening, however, Butler (AEU) and
another union official called a meeting
at Dandenong to get support for the
dispute. They got a very bad reception
DURING A RIOT IN FESTIVAL HALL
ALBERT MONK
from some 600 or 700 employees. With
the exception of about 40, the men all
walked off from the meeting leaving the
remainder to later carry a resolution of
support.
The initiative was still with Car-
michael’s union—the AEU—although its
membership is a very small minority in
the industry.
The Festival Hall meeting of Monday,
October 5, was a copybook operation.
The front seats were stacked and the
usual arrangements to howl down any
opposition speakers had been planned.
Once again, a member of the VBU
sought to have the foundrymen’s claim
dealt with first and not buried in the
wider issue. The organised claque howled
him down, indicating clearly that nobody
else should get up and express such a
silly idea.
The resolution, which was carried,
was carefully planned—but not by the
THC Executive. It was framed in such
a way as to make successful negotiation
almost impossible. It stated that, unless
the management of GM-H negotiated
immediately an unconditional increase in
the wage rates of all GM-H employees,
the members would remain on strike
until their demands were met.
That afternoon the Melbourne THC
Disputes Committee met. It was advised
of the decision of the meeting that morn-
ing. Since the Federal Executive of the
VBU was to meet later that day, the
matter would become an interstate dis-
pute. This let the Melbourne THC out,
since the matter would now pass into
the hands of the Australian Council of
Trade Unions.
The meeting decided that, under the
circumstances, the dispute should be
carried on until the ACTU took it over.
That day the ACTU convened a meeting
of unions for Thursday, October 8,
1964.
So at no stage from September 18 to
October 5 did the members or any
authoritative body in the trade union

movement , decide that a strike should
take place.
The composition of the labor torce
at Fishermen’s Bend is approximately 27
per cent Greek; 24 per cent Italian; and
the balance, Australian and Central
European. This meant that at mass
meetings the business had to be trans-
lated through interpreters. The “Guar-
dian” was very proud of the role played
by its “reporter”, Mr George Zangalis,
in keeping the Greeks informed on the
crisis.
A delajde is the second biggest centre of
GM-H production. Events had been
set in train there. Carmichael’s opposite
number, Communist J. Goss, visited the
GM-H plant on September 25 (the same
day that the first stop-work meeting took
place at Fishermen’s Bend) “to get funds
for a Peace delegation”. On Tuesday,
October 6 (the day after the VBU asked
the ACTU to take over the dispute), Mr
Goss told what was ostensibly an AEU
meeting at GM-H “that others interested
could come”. A motion to take strike
action in support of Victoria was de-
feated on the voices. A motion to levy
everybody on the plant £1 per member
to assist the Victorian strikers was
shouted down and the crowd of approxi-
mately 600 then broke up.
On Friday, October 9, Mr Goss was
back on the job. Since the matter was
an ACTU affair, it was not for him to
take resolutions. But if the AEU mem-
bers wanted to take strike action in
support of Victoria, he would submit a
recommendation to the ACTU. He was
howled down. A motion was then moved
to adjourn the meeting to St Clair centre
in Woodville for October 13.
In some mysterious way, the Adelaide
Trades and Labor Council recommenda-
tion to the meeting on the 13th was in
favor of the men going on strike. This
was supported by the AEU Common-
wealth Councillor and Communist Party
member, Cuthbert (“Cup”) Southwell.
Cries for a division were ignored. The
resolution was declared carried in the
midst of considerable rowdiness.
Now it was the turn of the ACTU
Disputes Committee to be given the run-
around. The Disputes Committee was
told by the Communists and their sup-
porters that the strike had the full back-
ing of the members and that the ACTU
should back them up and seek negotia-
tion with GM-H. Accordingly it was
decided that the dispute should go on
whilst attempts at negotiation were
undertaken. The same elements told the
workers that they had ACTU backing
and they should back the ACTU.
So the ACTU’s backing was obtained
on the strength of the assertion that the
workers wanted the strike: the workers’
backing on the strength of loyalty to
the ACTU.
The Disputes Committee met next on
October 19. In the 24 days from Sep-
tember 25, GM-H had not shifted its
ground an inch. Thereupon Carmichael
and his supporters urged that the dis-
pute should be intensified and that, to
achieve this, a finance appeal for a
quarter of a million pounds should be
set under way by the ACTU.
I he VBU declared that it could con-
tribute between £20,000 and £25.000,
but beyond this it could not commit
itself.
Even at this stage it was apparent
that unless GM-H shifted its ground
which appeared most unlikely a pro-
longation of the dispute would serve no
useful purpose. Five days later a
specially summoned meeting of the
ACTU Disputes Committee was called
for Saturday morning (24th). At this
meeting Albert Monk tabled an agree-
ment reached between him and Mr D. L.
Hegland, General Manager of GM-H.
Monk made it clear that he was con-
vinced that GM-H would not shift from
its basic position and that this was the
best that could be, obtained from them.
He made no bones about the financial
Situation which was that sufficient
funds had been received to pay only £3
to each VBU member on strike, and that
there appeared little or no prospect of
maintaining any rational level of strike
pay. He also pointed to the fact that the
unions which had already been fined
£7OOO faced further charges which
could involve £50,000.
The Vehicle Builders’ Union and the
Australasian Society of Engineers, which
represented about 80 per cent of those
on strike or stood down (over 15,000
workers), wanted to recommend a re-
sumption of work to the members. The
opposition to this proposal was led up
by the AEU Communists, Messrs Car-
michael and Southwell. The vote was
taken. Albert Monk’s settlement terms
were turned down by 19 votes to 15.
The majority of 19 included eight votes
from four unions which represented only
15 members on strike. The two unions
which had 15,000 men out, had four
votes only.
On Tuesday, October 27, the Disputes
Committee met again. Albert Monk
gave a further report, indicating his view
that the attitude of the company had
hardened on the issue of an all-round
wage increase. The proposal of the
Executive was that the Disputes Com-
mittee agree to a return to work on the
terms stated and that the opinion of
the members on this recommendation be
obtained by a secret ballot conducted
about November 4, at which time some
additional strike pay would be paid.
Carmichael and Southwell fought to
the last, but the proposal was carried.
Southwell delivered himself of his final


classic statement: “I have always been
told that if you want to lose a strike this
is the way to do it. It is a denial of
leadership by the informed.”
The violent events which surrounded
the ballot followed. As the workers
jntered the Melbourne meeting, they
sere handed copies of “Strike News”
ivhich claimed to be authorised by
‘GM-H Strike Committee”. No official
body of this name existed. It claimed to
be printed by the “Australian Greek
Publications”. It was identical in type,
paper, layout and phraseology with
pamphlets issued by the Amalgamated
Engineering Union, and printed by the
Communist Coronation Press.
Tt was one small point made by “Strike
* News” which carried interest. This
was that the ACTU’s recommendation
was wrong, because “only now has
GM-H run out of Holden cars in
reserve”. This was “leadership by the
informed”. They had now shown their
knowledge of strike strategy by admitting
that when they called the strike, GM-H
had such reserves of cars as to have
made the strike hopeless from the start.
“Don’t present me as if I was one-
sided.” Carmichael had told the “Guar-
dian”, “interested in the wages struggle
in isolation from the wider issues”.
’ What were the wider issues he was in-
terested in? The ACTU and the THC
resolutions of the last two years, con-
demning the actions of Communists in
certain shop committees and in certain
unions (notably the AEU) for calling
unauthorised stoppages, tell the story.
This dispute was just such a stoppage.
It was under way for a fortnight before
I it was brought to the THC Disputes
Committee, and almost three weeks be-
fore it came to the ACTU.
Behind all of these unauthorised stop-
pages has been what the ACTU has
described as “attempts to usurp and
undermine the authority of the trade
union movement”. It can be simply
defined as a prepared plan to set up
new centres of authority which would
take their instructions from the Com-
munist Party and not the trade union
movement.
The ultimate aim was and is to dis-
credit. disorganise, repudiate and replace
non-Communist leadership in the unions.
OIL
1300 Barrels
MELBOURNE Last week’s oil
strike of 1300 barrels a day at Wapet’s
third Yardarino well near Geraldton is
the first big mainland strike in the West.
Following the discovery of some oil in
the drilling stem of Yardarino No. 1 five
months ago, The Bulletin visited the
well and came away with the impression
(reported in The Bulletin, August 1,
1964) that “confirmation of a com-
mercial oilfield could come more quickly
from Yardarino than from Barrow
Island”.
Since then a second wildcat has been
drilled on Barrow Island with only
limited success. (Oil flowed at a maxi-
mum rate of 100 barrels a day com-
pared with a rate of 925 maximum in
No. 1 well.) Equally at Yardarino
No. 2, which was being drilled to help
delineate the structure while The Bul-
letin was there and was not expected to
strike oil, did not in fact reveal any.
However, the drillers were very con-
fident of success in Yardarino No. 3
which they had planned before the sec-
ond well went down. Now they have
got a flow in excess of the rate of the
latest well at Alton in Queensland, they
should go on to prove a commercial
field more expeditiously than at the re-
mote Barrow Island.
CHURCH—I
Religious War
SYDNEY Most of Australia’s
150,000 adherents of the Greek Or-
thodox Church are involved in the dis-
pute between their Patriarch-appoint-
ed Archbishop Ezekial and an unofficial
Metropolitan from Paphos on the island
of Cyprus, the self-styled Archbishop
Photios. Most of the issues are now be-
fore the Equity Court and are, at the
time of going to press, sub judice.
These affect the right of Father George
Kateris, who gives his allegiance to
Archbishop Ezekial, to continue as pastor
of the Redfern church in the face of a
challenge by the pro-Photios section of
the NSW Orthodox Community who
claim that he functions only as their
employee and that they have the right
to dismiss him. Last week Father Kate-
ris was granted a restraining injunction
against interference by Photios.
His Grace, Archbishop Ezekial, was
chosen in January, 1959, to succeed his
predecessor who was killed in a car ac-
cident. Before that and since 1937
Ezekial, a native of Partras in the Pelo-
ponnese, had been serving as a pastor of
the Greek church in the United States.
In keeping with his beliefs that his ties
with Greece were religious and not tem-
poral, he became an American citizen
and in 1950 was consecrated bishop of
the Titular See of Nazianos which took in
the New England area. Four years later
he became bishop of Chicago, a diocese
embracing 13 States and parts of Canada.
During his term of office there, he
served on President Eisenhower’s Traffic
Safety Committee, on youth advisory and
child welfare committees and played a
leading role in the fight against juvenile
delinquency. He established a home for
the aged, spoke in radio and television
programmes and stayed right outside
politics.
When he came to Australia, Ezekial
was a vigorous man of 46 with a flowing
black beard lending dignity to his office.
Today the beard is very grey, and the
rather full face is lined. He looks much
older than 53.
His role within the Greek community
can best be understood if one realises the
close relationship Greek priests have
had with their flock. In the war of in-
dependence against the Turks of 1820,
priests took up arms and fought with the
patriots struggling to see their land freed
of a four hundred year occupation.
During the Second World War, as many
Australian servicemen recall, priests
again fought with the Greek underground
against the Nazis. The church has an
active voice in Greek education. Marri-
age rites are only official when solem-
nized before a Greek priest. While
Greece has its quota of agnostics, even
these recognise the role of the priest in
ARCHBISHOP PHOTIOS
ARCHBISHOP EZEKIAL
civic affairs and not a few priests were
exiled with leftists during the civil war
that broke out in 1947.
So when waves of Greeks began emi-
grating, it was axiomatic that they should
demand their pastors follow and set
up the centres of religious and social
administration. In Australia, the first
Greek church was consecrated in 1898.
The New South Wales archdiocese was
established in 1908 with an archbishop
appointed by the head of the Orthodox
Church in Istanbul. Ezekial, on his ap-
pointment by Patriarch Athinagoras, be-
came the fourth in line to serve in this
country.
One of his first public statements in
July, 1959, was to tell Greeks living in
this country that their loyalty belonged to
Australia. He urged them not to feel “as
Greeks living in Australia, but as Aus-
tralians of Greek origin. Remember that
origin,” he exhorted, “but remember also
that your loyalty and devotion belongs
to Australia.”
It has been charged against him that


Tie is a medievalist wanting to impress
the old Greek tradition on people living
in a new community His published
statements would seem to contradict
this..
The various Greek communities in
Australia were set up and registered
under the Companies Act. Each one had
independent auditors of their adminis-
trative finances. The Archbishop accep-
ted that, created mixed lay and clerical
governing bodies with laymen predomi-
nating and having the right of decision
on temporal matters. As a member of a
strict monastic order, he reserved the
right to speak on matters spiritual. The
break came when the NSW community
headed by Mr D. Tsingris refused to
recognise his authority. It is pointed out
that this “community” numbers no more
than 2000 in a total community estim-
ated at between 56,000 and 60,000
people.
To advance their claims against him,
the community supporting Photios se-
cured the services of a Sydney public
relations consultant. - Loyal members of
the NSW community suggested that
Archbishop - Ezekial do likewise. He is
said to have thrown up his hands in hor-
ror a| the. suggestion preferring to rely
on' his belief in the justice of his case.
In response to a plea for jurisdiction
the Greek Patriarch recently unfrocked
Photios, a priest who had come from
Memphis, Tennessee, after resigning from
his archbishopric in Cyprus in protest, it
is said, against the violence perpetrated
by the EOKA terrorists.
A communist element has been at work
in the struggles inside the Greek com-
munities. Part of their work was seen
in the recent GM-H strike in Melbourne
where ACTU president Mr A. E. Monk
condemned efforts to disrupt the back-
to-work ballot “by an organised section
• mainly Greeks.” On the other hand the
public relations spokesman has charged
Archbishop Ezekial as being a supporter
of the American John Birch Society.
CHURCH-II
The Witnesses
BRISBANE A Brisbane Supreme
Court Judge, Mr Justice Stable, last
week criticised the Jehovah's Witness
religious sect for using young children
to spread its teachings. “I regard the use
of a child on such an occasion as utterly
incomprehensible,” he said. Mr Justice
Stable was granting a judgment nisi for
divorce to a Brisbane woman Mrs Jean
Cecily Kinivan whose husband claimed
that after she joined the sect in 1960
she neglected the children to spread the
sect’s teachings.
Mrs Kinivan brought the action against
Thomas Kinivan, assistant land com-
missioner ot Au;henflower, on the
ground of his adultery with Gillian Hoy,
governess of Quilpie. In reply to the
petition Kinivan claimed that in early
1963 he found his wife had been in-
doctrinating their elder child with the
beliefs of the sect. He said his wife
became domineering and continually
bombarded him with the sect's propa-
ganda accusing him of being possessed
by the demon.
Mr Justice Stable said Mrs Kinivan
gave him the impression of being an
almost fanatical devotee to the sect and
had no doubt that her devotion to the
sect was a great factor in the final
breakdown of her marriage. He gave
Mrs Kinivan custody of her two child-
ren, aged six and three.
CENSORSHIP
A Blasphemy Case?
SYDNEY NSW detectives have
recently been interviewing students at
the University ol NSW in connection
with an article entitled “God in a Mari-
juana Patch”, which was published in a
down-town issue of the University stu-
dent paper, “Tharunka”. It is reported
that they are collecting information with
view to a possible blasphemy charge
against the editor, or publisher, or author
if he can be identified. If this is so, it will,
be not only one of the very few cases
in Australia's history (there has been no
blasphemy case involving a magazine or
newspaper since 1919) but probably,
one of the very few in the world for
many years. .
“God in a Marijuana Patch” is a fan-
tasy, purporting to dramatise a conver-
sation between God and a Martian Devil.
God is so sickened by earthly moralising
and the religious cults he decides to
present Earth to the Devil.
Public attention was first drawn to it
when Archbishop Gough described it
publicly as the most blasphemous article
he had ever read.
During their interviewing police have
met with what they describe as “lack of
co-operation”. Most students have been
vague and non-committal; some have
been accompanied by a solicitor. The
President of the NSW University Stu-
dents’ Council, Mr Alf Van der Poorten,
has been advised by police not to lose
any minutes or correspondence relating
to the publishing of “Tharunka” in case
these documents have to be sub-
poenaed.
Many of the police enquiries have
been directed towards solving the ap-
parent mystery of authorship. Who is
the “Michael Baldwin” who signed the
article? To help solve this problem police
have approached University administra-
tion officials as well as students of Syd-
ney University. The President of Syd-
ney University SRC, Mr Mike Weber,
was interviewed in his capacity as pub-
lisher of “Honi Soit” and asked whether
he knew “Baldwin”. Weber reported
that the police appear to suspect some
sort of student conspiracy stemming
from the inter-related staff of “Tharun-
ka” “Honi Soit” and “Oz”.
Meanwhile, last week four University
of NSW students and a publisher
of “Tharunka” won appeals against con-
victions on charges of having published
an obscene article, “The Gas Lash”,
in “Tharunka” on February 17. They
are: Martin Richie Sharp, of Cran-
brook Lane, Bellevue Hill; Michael
William Robertson of Abuklea Road,
Epping; Alexander Popov of Pacific
Highway, Warrawee; Russel Peter Mor-
gan Conyngham of Marlow Street,
Campsie, and the printer. Alfred
MARTIN SHARP
JUDGE A. LEVINE
Francis James, honorary managing
director of Anglican Press Ltd, Queen
Street, Chippendale.
Judge A. Levine in the Sydney
Quarter Sessions Appeals Court quashed
convictions and fines imposed by Mr
E. J. Gibson, SM, in Central Court on
August 12.- Mr Gibson had fined Sharp
and James £lO each and the other three
students £5 after all had pleaded not
guilty.
Judge Levine in his reserved judgment
said that under the Act a publication
was deemed obscene if it unduly
emphasised matters of sex, crimes of
violence, gross cruelty or horror. It
was never intended that every possible
recipient of the publication should be
taken into account. “If this were so,
the criterion for determining the likeli-
hood to deprave or corrupt would in
most cases be determined by the
ascertainment of the lowest level of
morality and intellectual discernment to
be found in the community,” he said.
Judge Levine said that in his view
the boundary of distribution was limited
by consideration of those persons into
whose hands the publication might be

reasonably expected to come. “In this
case the class of persons and age groups
with whom I am concerned is con-
stituted by the students attending the
University of NSW.”
“The publication used slang expres-
sions, contained distasteful words and
disgusting situations, and on first read-
ing it appeared objectionable. But I am
not sitting here as a judge of taste, nor
to say whether I like it or not. We are
living in times when great freedom of
expression on matters of sex is accepted
by the community.”
The judge felt the publication would
fail as a satire as far as the majority
of students was concerned. “It would
either have no effect at all or merely
provoke disgust,” he said. In his view
the community did not object to matters
of sex being portrayed on film and
television unless a tendency to deprave
and corrupt occurred. Judge Levine
found that “Tharunka” had no such
tendency among the students, that it
did not offend against the community,
did not unduly emphasise matters of sex
and was not obscene under the Act.
EDUCATION
Axe to Fall
MELBOURNE The latest turn of
the screw in Melbourne University’s
entrance quotas will affect all faculties.
Overall, the effect will be to hold total
enrolment for 1965 at 13,800 slightly
below the 13,827 students enrolled this
year. Indications are that for most
faculties, students intending to start
courses next year will need to be well
up to honors standard in matriculation
to make the grade. No university likes
to apply entrance quotas and the sheer
kindness of the Melbourne University
authorities in 1963 and 1964 has pro-
pelled them into a situation where the
1965 quotas will be the harshest yet
seen. Under the formula laid down by
the Universities Commission, Melbourne
University was not supposed to have an
enrolment of 13,800 until 1966.
The understandable lenience of its
faculties over the question of rejecting
qualified matriculation students during
the past two years has produced a situa-
tion where the figure was passed this
year. As a result the axe must fall more
sharply on the 1965 matriculants.
One of the faculties which will be hit
by quota requirements for the first time
in 1965 is Education. The courses
offered in this faculty are postgraduate
ones for students who, having completed
courses in Arts, Science or other fields,
intend to become teachers. In other
words, an entrance quota in Education
means that postgraduate, as distinct
from undergraduate, students will be
excluded. The effect on the supply of
teachers for Victoria’s secondary schools
could be disastrous. Teachers with
degrees in Arts or Science may obtain
temporary employment with the Educa-
tion Department, but cannot obtain
permanent positions without some train-
ing in education methods and the
Diploma of Education is the preferred
variety.
Victoria faces a situation where it will
have numbers of teachers who, after
spending three years on their Science or
Arts courses, are denied full professional
standing because of their inability to
obtain the extra year of training which
leads to the Diploma of Education.
Monash University has an Education
Faculty, but it has indicated that it will
be unable to accept all the students
excluded from Melbourne. The danger is
that a solution will be found at the cost
of academic standards in Victoria. The
State Education Department accepts as
an alternative to university training, the
courses provided at its own Secondary
Teachers’ College. At best this body is

PRESS
Pauling’s Stand
CANBERRA Professor Linus
Pauling, a guest of the recent Sydney
“Peace” Congress, held a Press confer-
ence in Canberra last Thursday.
Question: Are Communist countries a
threat to peace anywhere in the world
today?
Answer: I do not know quite what
you mean.
Q. Well, what about their activities in
Vietnam?
A. It is the confrontation of Com-
munism and Capitalism which is the
threat to peace.
Q. Capitalism in Vietnam? I thought
it was pretty feudal.
A. No. 1 meant the American presence.
If Americans withdrew there 'would be
peace.
Q. Would it be a desirable sort of
peace in your opinion?
A. Better than this dreadful war and
better than living under military dictator-
ship.
Q. But wouldn't a Communist regime
be a dictatorship like the Chinese?
A. Yes, but according to my observa-
tions and according to the observations
of a number of your eminent scientists,
the Chinese people are quite happy with
their Government.
Q. Do you think that the vested inter-
ests of peop'e concerned with armaments
manufacture in your country are a
major barrier to peace and disarmament?
A. Yes. There are a large number of
people who would lose their jobs. So the
labor unions are by and large against
disarmament, but they are coming to
realise that there are ways by which their
jobs might be saved by Government
action in the economy. The big obstacle
is the free enterprisers. The capitalists.
But they are being worn down. The
peace campaigning of people like myself
is creating a climate of opinion in favor
DR and MRS LINUS PAULING
of disarmament. Look how the Press
came almost unanimously to my defence
when I was called before the Senate
security committee.
Q. The American Press is responsive
to public opinion then?
A. Well, yes, to a certain extent, but
of course sections of it, being owned by
rich men, are backward.
Q. Is the peace movement having si-
milar success in the Soviet Union? Is
the Government there similarly respon-
sive to public opinion?
A. Yes. Yes. Certainly, though it is
responsive in a different way. Access to
information is difficult, you know.
Q. Now, turning to the peace congress
in Sydney, did you see any evidence of
Communist domination?
A. None whatsoever.
Q. It is reported that in every session
where a motion criticising Communist
policy was put up, it was defeated.
A. There may have been disagree-
ments in some sessions.
Q. One motion suggesting that the
present trend towards convergence be-
tween the social systems of the USSR
and the United States was in the interests
of world peace was defeated.
A. But that motion has overtones of
anti-Chinese sentiment in it. We must
do our utmost to bring China into the
world community.
Q. A motion criticising the Soviet
Government’s policy of anti-Semitism
was rejected.
A. But it is bad that particular coun-
tries should be attacked and victimised.
Q. There was plenty of criticism of
Western countries.
A. I do not know whether you are
properly informed about what went on.
Q. Were you disturbed that a motion
criticising the failure of the Soviet
Government for refusing to allow the
free distribution of pacifist literature, was
defeated?
A. I do not know whether your re-
ports are correct.
Q. Well, would you be disturbed if my
report was correct?
A. I do not answer hypothetical ques-
tions. It is my policy.

It’s 15 degrees cooler at number 27
It’s hot again. Hot outside and not much cooler inside.
Except at No 27. Last summer they called the Insulwool
people and had their entire ceiling insulated with
Insulwool. So now they’re 15 0 cooler than the house
next door.
Insulwool stops the heat at the ceiling. A thick
layer of rock fibre traps millions of tiny air pockets.
So the heat is effectively retarded. It means you live in a
better climate all the year round.
Insulwool is spun out of molten rock so it never
deteriorates. Lasts a lifetime. Fire-retarding and damp-
proof. It takes less than a day to condition your home
with Insulwool. No mess, no fuss. For an average
home it can cost as little as £45 to install. (It increases
the value of the home by far more than that.)
Cooler in summer, warmer in winter and in winter
you save up to 40% on fuel bills. No other single thing
can add so much comfort to your home.
So, if you don’t live at No 27, ring Insulwool today
for a free quotation. Or at least fill in the coupon below
and get all the facts.

FLUORIDATION
No Dentists
ADELAIDE South Australian
Premier Sir Thomas Playford is con-
cerned by the growing shortage of
dentists in the State and recently re-
vealed that it was virtually impossible
to successfully man the Education De-
partment’s dental service because of this.
Premier Playford said that in the past
five years there had been an average of
17 dental graduates a year, and in one
particular year only one student had
graduated. Several SA dentists, he said,
had waiting lists four months long and
there were no indications of the position
easing any. He felt the position had been
worsened by graduates leaving Austra-
lia to seek employment overseas.
Following Premier Playford’s an-
nouncement of the shortage of dentists
an SA Parliamentary Select Committee
recommended the addition of fluoride to
the State's water supplies. The commit-
tee, noting in its recommendation that
the standard of dental health in SA was
very low, considered that fluoridation
was the most effective, convenient and
most economical combatant.
Anti-fluoridation witnesses who gave
evidence before the Committee all said
fluoridation was objectionable on ethi-
cal or religious grounds. They described
fluoridation as mass medication, crimi-
nal, undemocratic and a moral issue in-
volving personal freedom. However,
the Committee felt it was neither reli-
gious nor ethical, but purely a public
health issue.
MIGRANTS
Disgruntled
PERTH The “Aurelia” sailed from
Fremantle on November 7 with more
than 100 grumbling British and Spaniard
migrants while Commonwealth migration
officers claimed privately that much of
the discontentment was justified the
result of exaggerated promises and in-
expert promises.
The migrants, mainly those who werj
attracted to the West by the State-spon-
sored Lonnie Mission led by RSL Chief
Mr Bill Lonnie, were guaranteed housing
and jobs. But the scheme was badly
phased and interim accommodation over-
flowed to such an extent that a number
had to be put up in hotels. Most of the
disgruntled men are from the north of
England and Scotland where a trades-
man would not consider doing another
tradesman’s work. They have been utw
willing to forget their specialised craft/
and do work that would earn them th
epithet of “scab” at home.
In the purposely unattractive migrar
camps, and in the industrial centres, witl

FISHING
Unsympathetic
BRISBANE —ll representatives of
the Japanese Government had been
watching State Parliament last week they
would have nodded their heads in silent
agreement when Fisheries Minister T. A.
Hiley warned that there would be no
sympathy for fishermen who seized five
miles of Japanese fishing gear off the
South Queensland coast.
Mr Hiley was referring to the removal
of Japanese tuna fishing buoys and
markers from water near the Barwon
Banks which run close to the three-mile
limit off Caloundra. “Such acts,” he
said, “could easily lead to charges of
piracy on the high seas or even theft.”
A Southport trawler skipper, Norm
Otto, was quoted in a Brisbane news-
paper late last month as having said he
removed the gear but Mr Hiley con-
sidered there were inconsistencies in two
statements made by the fisherman. In
one statement Otto was reported to have
said that the lines were set across the
Barwon Banks and in another that the
gear was inside the three-mile limit.
“I want to say quite deliberately that
1 regard it as extremely dangerous for
anyone to behave in the manner that
was reported on this occasion,” Mr Hiley
said. He told Parliament that the State .
Government’s control reached only to
the three-mile limit while outside this)
the Federal Government “had some
powers and responsibilities”. The Japan-1
ese Government was most anxious to
avoid any conflict with Australian fisher-
men on their traditional fishing grounds.]


“Pan Am arranged our fact-finding
tour of American bakeries. We found out
some facts about airlines, too!”
—says Mr. Syd Packham, President', Associated Bread Manufacturers of Aust. and N.Z.
*‘l had no idea that Pan Am could
do so much for us. They not only
planned our tour so that we’d see a
true cross-section of America, but
gave us personal, individual atten-
tion everywhere we went—as if they
were dealing with just one passenger
instead of a large group. I know
they made our tour a success.”

The Folk People
8/6 for coffee, gloom and a sad song
by CHARLES HIGHAM
Ir’s in the midst of a stolidly bourgeois
area, streets named after pioneers,
a British-style music-hall in the of-
fing, two-storey houses whose lights fade
primly at ten. It might be Surbiton, or
one of the more pretentious suburbs of a
Canadian city, except for the tall slant-
ing palms over the used car lots, the
raucous workmen's voices from a bar
down the street. In the windows, there’s
thick straw matting, wooden cross beams
giving a suggestion of the rustic which
continues when you step inside. Here,
traffic noise dims, long tables stretch
away into the dark, there are hard
benches, kerosene lamps trickily rigged
up with electric fittings, horse harness
on the walls, and horse stalls crammed
with silent people, motionless. Sullen
college boys in regulation sweater, jeans
and suede boots, eyes dead under cow-
lick hair, huddle in groups, reverently.
They stare, whisper between sips of
coffee, and never smile. Austerely re-
moved from them, pale girls with waist-
length hair occasionally exchange a
blind, meaningless glance. The way they
look, you'd think the sun had never
shone.
On an upturned barrel, a girl, thin and
paler than the rest, crouches in a skin-
tight black leotard, knees clasped close,
face bare of makeup, huge vacant eyes
peeping through the curtain of reddish
hair or closed in rapture. Now and
again she unclasps one knee to brush
the strings of a guitar. Her voice is
clear, high and sweet as she sings about
Engels, Marx and Trotsky. When she’s
through, there’s not much applause, a
few people shift self-consciously on the
benches. Then they are motionless again.
Another singer, Christ-like, bearded, with
a hollow chest and shining visible ribs
sits on the barrel and wearily picks up
a banjo.
It’s a folkie cafe, one of dozens that
have sprung up in the cities. The atmos-
phere in these places is usually joyless
and naive. Customers sit there hour
after hour in conditions of total discom-
fort, almost mute, glum, and fixedly
staring into space. They pay between
5/- and 8/6 for six or seven singers,
indifferent coffee, service by icily snooty
waitresses, and the feeling of being part
of a secretive, enclosed community. A
hard core of regulars are bearded
aesthetes, more or less after the Chelsea
or Greenwich Village pattern, though
probably rather better fed and less
intelligent. The rest are solidly middle-
class, pink-cheeked GPS boys and bland
stockbrokers’ daughters out for kicks.
There are sometimes surfies, but usually
of the more well-heeled variety. The
boisterous, vulgar and uninhibited mobs
which cram the stadium at Beatles-type
shows are wholly missing. Young execs
and their girl friends, smooth university
assembly-line products in law or medi-
cine, drive in from Toorak or Bellevue
Hill. But most of the customers are
students or school-children, incomeless
scions of the cushy professional groups.
Bohemia in the suburbs
Incredibly, an Australian Bohemia is
A booming. The names of the places
tell all. In Sydney there’s the Last Straw,
the Troubador, the Folk Attick, the Gas
Lash. In Melbourne, the Traynors, the
Folk Attick, the Fall Out Shelter, the
Reata, the Off-Stage, the Jolly Roger.
In Adelaide, the Catacombs, the Am-
brosia, the Camille. In Brisbane, the
Coolibah Tree, the Primitif, the Globe-
trotter, the Cave.
One of the most popular is the Cata-
combs in Adelaide. You walk in by a
narrow door, and along a black and
white tiled floor of an office building in
one of the inner suburbs. On the other
side of the door is an impressionistic
sketch of a woman’s face, preparing the
uninitiated for what is below.
Down a flight of threaded carpet stairs
with black painted walls reflecting no
light, you pass a desk where the owner's
wife is pulling a coffee-machine. Three
pictures on the walls indicate that well-
known singers Bob Hardie, Dick Bond
and Tina Lawton started there. There
are black and red walls, deep red cur-
tains, and a red ceiling. Light seeps
dimly out of scattered, 15-watt globes.
There’s a queue here at eight p.m., people
waiting to sit on spidery wicker chairs
or the floor.
It all, they say, began in Melbourne
in the late ’fifties, sprouting in dim clubs,
emerging from the always fierce interest
there in jazz and blues. Paul Marks,
a skinny, bearded British exile with far-
away eyes, claims to have got it going.
Today, Brian Mooney and Martin Wynd-
ham-Reade, respectively strong and pea-
sant-like and plumply bearded, are the
only two singers everyone in the folkie
cult seems unanimously to respect, and
they live in Melbourne. Always more
serious about everything than Sydney,
the city has nurtured folk song more
generously, although a few of its people
have moved interstate in search of fresh
fields.
In Sydney, probably, folk song got its
big boost during the White Collar
Festival in 1961. There were folk songs
at open air meetings, and a gramophone
record was released for the Margins
and Leave Campaign, called “Oh, Pay
me.” On the same disc issued by
Blue and White Collar Records was an
Equal Pay Song, a snide ballad about
Hooker, an Automation Song. Alex
Hood, doyen of the “authentic” folk
singers a purist and severe critic of
other performers Marian Henderson,
current star of “Jazz Meets Folk” and
another singer performed the numbers.
A further stimulus to local folkies came
with the visits last year of Pete Seeger
and Brother John Sellers.
Since then, folk song has inevitably
been caught up with politics. The Com-


munist Party features folk songs at its
meetings, calling for better deals for
the workers, satirising politicians and
businessmen, agitating for more money.
The more raucous, boisterous songs, not
so much the mournful ones, strummed
madly and belted out brashly, appeal
to the members of the party and get in
the workers present. In the coffee-shops
too, notably the Troubador in Sydney,
there is a flavor of the Left, songs sug-
gesting we must do away with the navy
and with all defence, songs attacking the
police, and anti-government songs. Few
are really savage in the manner of the
American singers like Bob Dylan and
Theodore Bikel. Instead, they are wry,
humorous in a rather soft way, or just
plain droopy.
Protest with the edge off
'VTone of these songs can be said to
represent any kind of important new
radical movement in the country. Many
are simply American songs of protest
with the edge rubbed off by the soft-living
atmosphere of Australian life. Even if
you deliberately lose several stone, go
without a shower for six weeks and grow
a grubby beard, it's hard to shake off
all those years of living off the fat of
the land. Not even the most dedicatedly
thin and dirty of the folk - singers
seemed half as unhealthy looking as
those I saw in 1962 in New York, or
half as fierce and intelligent in their
singing. One suspects that in a year
or two they’ll be back some of them,
anyway looking pink and sleek again
in narrow suits.
Who’s behind these coffee-shops? The
nearest person to a mastermind in Sydney
is a tall, thin, narrow-faced man in cir-
cular jet cuff-links, called Jim Carter.
Almost inaudible of voice and with a
shock of Beatle-cut rapidly greying hair,
this 35-year-old former warehouse man
and factory worker already has a hand
in the Copperfield, a kinky, Dickensian
roost tucked behind Central Railway,
leases the Troubador, a monkish refec-
tory on two levels in Edgecliff, and co-
leases the Last Straw, a chi-chi barn
complete with straw-decorated loft on
Military Road. Though not, apparently,
of pronounced political persuasion him-
self, Carter has done quite a bit to help
across the Left-wing performers, notably
Gary Shearston. He pays his entertainers
Actors’ Equity rates, charges 8/6 for a
cup of coffee (entrance fee included)
and has plans to go into full-scale entre-
preneuring.
His Sydney rivals are a man called
Murphy, who runs Binky's Burgers in
Elizabeth Street and has opened The
Gas Lash next door, decorated with
Martin Sharp’s snaggle-toothed fauna,
earth on the floor, and a false ceiling of
sacking, and Michael Darby, 18-year-
old son of the famous Darbys radio
team, and of that Independent member
for Manly whose Press quotes pack
a king-sized folder in most newspaper
libraries. “Five months ago I had an
industrial cleaning agency and a job
printery,” Darby told me. “I had sev-
eral students working for me. I was
looking for something new and one of
the fellows in the office suggested the
Folk Attick. I still pay him £lO a week
for that idea. I took over an old tene-
ment building in the Cross and installed
ultra-violet lighting.” (I called at the
place one night: tall, ancient, and dark,
lit only by the ultra-violet glow bathing
the singers and thin, guttering candles
in wine-bottles, most of the customers
crouched furtively on stairs out of ear-
shot of the performers but silent just
the same, and a singer in each room,
surrounded by bodies, crammed solid.)
“Now I have a Melbourne Folk Attick
and a Surfer's Paradise Folk Attick.
“Most of my customers are in the low
income or no income brackets. They’re
school-kids, or young students who want
a night’s entertainment for five bob. I
can get 700 in at a squeeze. I pay some
of my singers £45 a week. As well as
singers in each room I've got one out
on the terrace for soft songs no
microphone, no neighbors’ complaints,
get it? I serve percolated coffee, lots of
people come and help in the kitchen.
There’s a host, too, who picks up cups
and searches people. Yes, searches them.
Has he any legal right to do so? Well,
no. But he searches them just the same.
For liquor, mostly. Somebody nearby
might complain of a strong smell of rum.
Anyone who objects to being searched
after being positively identified in this
way is given his five bob and shown
the door. We don't allow pickups
either.” Darby grew stern, austere. “If
we see anybody necking too much we
flash a torch on them. We know all the
street girls in the Cross and if we see
one coming we’d show them they
weren’t welcome, but on the whole they
don’t come our way.
“Everything in the Folk Attick is
strictly moral. I won’t have anything
dirty, perves, things like that. Heavy
petting is out. On politics, I’m not keen
on songs attacking the Prime Minister,
even if my father did leave the Liberal
Party at its request. 1 don't go for Gary
Shearston or Paul Marks, that stuff.
Things like Civil Liberties songs, Bour-
geois Blues, that kind of thing, are ban-
ned. But I’ve nothing against the work-
ing class. Or surfies. I like them better
than the sunglasses and long cigarette
holder mob from Bellevue Hill or Darl-
ing Point. Those just come in and make
supercilious remarks ‘Oh, I don’t
think much of that do you?’ ” Darby
looked threatening for a moment. “They
take their sunglasses off when they come
to the Folk Attick.”
Queen of the folkies is Marian Hen-
derson, a cool, tall, pale, frail girl in a
pony tail who sings at the Astor Motor
Hotel, Woolloomooloo, nights in the
televised weekly “Jazz Meets Folk”. Her
voice seems to come from the outer
spheres, and she was relaxed but watch-
ful in the middle of the afternoon I saw
her, drinking hard liquor before the first
take. “I began by buying a banjo after
arriving from Melbourne in 1959,” she
said. “If you mentioned folk singing in
those days people looked at you as
though you were funny. But today it is
the best way young people have of let-
ting us know their thoughts. This is
simple, straightforward music, don’t
misunderstand it. ‘Jazz Meets Folk’ is
well, not exactly a marriage but an en-
gagement between the two things. And
in a way they’re the same, blues is folk.
I’ve a feeling for both. My grandfather
was a wheelwright and another grand-
father a blacksmith. So I feel, what’s the
French word? Simpatico with them. I
feel half-way bush, half-way city. Folk
songs combine country and city elements.
King's Cross at five o'clock in the morn-
ing can smell as good as a hayfield after
the burning ... in addition to this com-
bining of the country and town traditions
there is a need among some of us to
reach the 70 per cent of Australians who
have an inferiority complex about their
own indigenous culture ... we want to
nibble away at that 70 per cent.”
Leonard Teale, an actor who has
recently released recordings of folk song,
said: “The performance of ‘Reedy River’
in the early 'fifties opened up a new world
for me. I think the folk song element is
an expression of the strong Irish element
in our life. I myself sang folk songs in
‘ln Sydney Tonight’ on television longer
ago than I care to remember. I’ve written
songs myself, ‘Click Go the Handles’ to
the tune of ‘Click Go the Shears’ about
poker-machines, and ‘To Have and To
Hold’. What we're having and holding
is Australia. Here we are with 10 mil-
lion people and 900 million to the north.
We're making sure they aren't getting
anything from us and that’s selfish. Of
course we're in terrible danger, and I
want to get our defence forces increased.
With any luck my songs may ring around
Australia ...”
A folkie against war
/"t ary Shearston, on the other hand,
wants to reduce defence by means
of folk song. “The song 1 sing called
‘The Voyager’ is based on the melody
of a sea chanty. It gets across the idea
that if we do away with the navy there
won’t be any more Voyager disasters be-
cause there won’t be any ships to sink . ..
“I’m a pacifist and I think we should
do away with all the armed forces.”
Like many folk singers, Shearston was

influenced in the early stages by Woody
Guthrie, Pete Seeger and Leadbelly. “My
mother was a singer and my father plays
the harmonica.
“My music has flowed out of things
that are happening from day to day.
One was about a girl who left a train
to go to a toilet and was murdered before
she could get back on the train. Pete
Seeger gave me the confidence to go on.
Santamaria tore me to shreds in his news-
paper for my Voyager song, he said
my forefathers died on the Kokoda Trail
and I was betraying them, but I don’t
care . . .
“I feel equally strongly over the treat-
ment of Aborigines. I’ve set Kath
Walker’s ‘I Want Freedom’ as a song.
My other bugaboo is religion or any-
way, Christianity. I want the university
to raise money for the Aborigines and
I want people to stop clinging to out-
moded Christian beliefs.”
Alex Hood, too, has sung of his poli-
tical convictions. Like Teale, he was
inspired by “Reedy River”. “My father
was a moulder and pattern maker and
my home was at Toongabbie. I began
in the Bushwacker’s Band, playing the
bones, bullock’s ribs you rattle between
your fingers, like this. I formed a group
called the Rambleers, harmonica, banjo,
guitar, then the quintet of the same
name.
“I was with Crystal Daw and Marian
Henderson as Daw, Hood and Hender-
son. It was a pretty good group, mate,
I’ll drum you.” After recording the
“Oh Pay Me” disc for Blue and White
Collar Records in 1961 he recorded one
called “A.L.P.” (and issued by the
same), including “We’re going to vote
Tom Morey,” to the tune of Tom Dooley,
“for a bus-shelter politician who became
member for Bligh.” Later, Daw, Hood
and Henderson broadcast on 2KY on a
programme sponsored by the Sydney
County Council, and founded the As-
sociation of Sydney Folk Singers. The
trio broke up in 1962; Alex Hood formed
another called “The Rambling Boys”.
Later that year he started the Folk Arts
Centre in Woollahra, in a disused shop
where he paid £l5 10s., a week rent,
acquired about 700 members at £2
membership fee, and supplied lessons,
chances to hear tapes, and books (the
Centre is now without a home).
Another of the leading folkie figures
is Paul Marks. Like several others, he
started as a jazz singer in Melbourne. He
has toured Britain with the Melbourne
New Orleans Jazz Band, now sings
at the Troubador and The Last Straw.
He was very much against the “protest”
song cult. “Most of the singers, they’re
so immature,” he said. “They’re pulling
the wool over people’s eyes . . .” He
sees folk-singing as essentially poetic and
romantic. “I see the song when I’m
singing it. I’m tremendously influenced
by Dylan Thomas. His images are fan-
tastic. I had this one in my head about
golden birds . . . most of the songs here
are too stark . . . like T. S. Eliot and
all those people ... the songs I sing
give me a feeling of fantasy . . . some-
times when I sing I can close my eyes
and see the crotchets and quavers in
colored shapes floating about in front of
my eyes ...”
One “commercial” group, The Tol-
men, and a pop-singer, Lionel Long,
have had considerable success outside
the coffee-shops, and have been generally
attacked. Long was in England at the
time of writing, but the Tolmen, who
support him, praised him and to a large
extent evidently reflected his views when
they told me: “These coffee-shop people
are simply jealous of anyone who looks
clean and is a success on television.
Every song those people do is simply an
imitation of an American number.”
Although far from dangerously radical,
the Tolmen did run into a small spot of
trouble when they were hired by the
Arts Council for the first folk singing
tour to schools the Council had spon-
sored. They were asked not to sing their
song “Eureka Stockade” because Eureka
was the name used by the younger Com-
munists. I rang Dorothy Helmrich of
the Council to ask her about this. “We
had a lot of Red trouble in our early
days,” she said. “We wanted to steer
clear of anything like that.”
A new cultural “feel”
“'T'he Council had been losing audi-
ences for Shakespearean plays and
operas—too deep, I guess,” said the Tol-
men’s spokesman, Geoff Turner. “We
went out to give the schools a new
cultural ‘feel’. We were auditioned at
the Cell Block Theatre in Sydney by an
audience of headmasters—they liked us.
We’re not political, whatever they say
about the Eureka song, and we’re not
bearers of culture, we’re entertainers.
It’s no good expecting folk singers to be
philosophers . . . it’s like asking Elvis
Presley to conduct a chamber orchestra.”
The Tolmen were savagely attacked
and the Council, too, for selecting
them by Don Henderson, a well-
known composer of folk-song, in the
magazine “The Music Maker” where he
had a column, the Folk Corner. He said
he had telephoned Miss Helmrich for an
explanation of the decision to send the
Tolmen on tour. “The answer” (he
wrote) “so staggered me that I am still
not sure that along with ‘dial a prayer’
and ‘dial the score’ the new list of Elsa
telephone services doesn’t include ‘dial a
goon show’ which I had somehow been
connected with.
“The lady who was instrumental in pick-
ing the group, in fact in her words had
everything to do with picking them, said,
‘I like them. They have a banjo and

one of those other things. The King-
ston Trio have one too’.”
Folk people meet the world
nPHE Arts Council tour of the Tolmen
is the first such, and tours, rather
than coffee-shops, seem to be the future
answer for folk singers. John Baker,
public relations officer for the Australian
Council of Salaried and Professional As-
sociations, has been among the first to
see this, organising a Four Capitals Folk
Song Tour earlier this year, with Tina
Lawton (a Joan of Arc-like Adelaide
girl) and Lenore Somerset (a former
opera singer) among others. The pro-
gramme featured a Prologue on In-
dustrial Folk Song, The Irish Rebel
Song, Songs of the Union Tradition, and,
rather oddly in the circumstances, God
Save the Queen An extraordinary pro-
gramme note contained some elaborate
explanations of folk song’s meanings
(“Though a folk singer may do it best,
the folk, at the risk of being obvious,
are just as active and vocal participants
in the process of protest”).
There is every sign that folk song’s
strongest adherents are moving out of
the coffee shops into the broader sphere
of schools, universities and public meet-
ing places. Books notably John Mani-
fold’s and Russel Ward’s on balladry —•
are already on the stands. Universities
have established folk song clubs with
serious discussion as well as perform-
ances. Melbourne University calls its
folk song club affectionately “MU Folk”,
but there’s no question of its being
the least bit frivolous. In the Press, in
all States, there is much discussion now
of folk music. In Sydney, Craig Mc-
Gregor writes learned reviews of per-
formances and Edgar Waters writes a
column. Folk Lore Societies are having
a field-day; in Brisbane, the local society
has opened a Folk Centre in a loft of
the Royal Geographic Society. This
Centre stems from the Bush Music Club,
which is still active in Sydney and else-
where, and collects material, as well as
offering songs by experienced singers
and talkathon get-togethers. The society
will shortly resuscitate the well-known
“Queensland Bush - Telegraph”, a folk-
lore journal.
Folk-song’s propagandists, Edgar
Waters, John Manifold, Russel Ward,
Frank Hardy, Kath Walker and lan
Turner present a formidable group, and
there’s no doubt where most of them can
be placed politically. Manifold, for in-
stance, concludes his recent “Who
Wrote the Ballads?” by describing the
ideal folk community in some primitive
region of the USSR. Waters in “The
Australian” is interested in setting up
“culture heroes for the politically mind-
ed intellectual young in 1964: Bob
Dylan, Edith Piaf, Bert Brecht, Gins-
berg, Modigliani, Yevtuschenko, Miles
Davis, Pete Seeger, Paul Clayton, A. L.
Lloyd, Woody G ’thrie”. lan Turner
wrote in the same newspaper, “Bour-
geois society, imposing a debased com-
modity culture on the mass of the people,
condemns the genuine popular culture”.
Frank Hardy has, of course, written
ballads and folk songs. In the Peace
Congress Rallies, Peace Groups, Peace
and Hiroshima Day Marches, Youth
against Apartheid Groups and CND
meetings the folk songs are today regular
features, playing their definite part.
The record companies are making as
much capital out of folk singers as the
political Left. All have folkies on their
lists, and they sell well, to slightly older
age groups than the now fading surf
songs which were the rage last summer.
Peter, Paul and Mary, Joan Baez, the
Clancy Brothers these are names that
bring gleams to promotion managers’
eyes. In Melbourne there is even a spe-
cialist folk music shop, Discurio, run
by Paul and Ruth Mann, Melbourne
agents for Folkway Records. Bob Dylan
is their top seller, and Judy Collins is
the most popular of the up-and-coming
artists.
For a while, the radio and TV people
resisted the boom, but they’ve capitulated
now. In Sydney one channel plans “Just
Folk”, to be hosted by Gary Shearston.
In Melbourne, there has been ABV’s
“Jazz Meets Folk”, also in Sydney from
ABN. The local magazine “Tradition”
and the American “Sing Out” keep the
folkies happy on the news-stands.
For the future, there’s a sign afoot
that folk song may invade the big
popular Festivals like the Moomba and
Waratah, with folkie floats. “I’m easing
myself out of Folk Song cafes,” Jim
Carter, still the brightest brain in the
business, told me. “I’ll have folk in
the Myer Music Bowl, and then we’ll
see.” No doubt of it, we will. Come
1984, we’ll probably be watching folk-
ies at the opening of the Opera House.
The coffee-shop craze may die, but folk-
ies are here to stay.


The Commonwealth Pacific Cable, COMPAC, which represents
a major venture of the Overseas Telecommunications Com-
mission (Australia) into cable ownership, is a partnership
project between Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
It has been planned and brought into being—ahead of schedule
and within the original cost estimates—through the co-opera-
tive efforts of the telecommunications authorities of these four
countries, under the direction of a management committee
headed by T. A. Housley, General Manager of O.T.C. (pictured
below). COMPAC is a multi-purpose communications coaxial
cable system with an' initial capacity of 80 two-way voice
channels enabling the simultaneous transmission and reception
of telephone, telegraph, phototelegraph, telex, leased teleprin-
ter and audio broadcast services. COMPAC
can carry voices, pictures, even
music, with a quality previously unattainable. It can be relied
upon for continuous, uninterrupted, unmutilitated service and it
has the capacity to meet the mounting demands for communica-
tions over the regions it serves. World calls now become local
calls. World broadcasts take on a new reality, and world news
a new sense of immediacy. For the modern tools of inter-
national commerce: the telephone, the teleprinter, the com-
puter, there are now more channels of communications, new
standards of speed and accuracy and dependability. And all
because of an incredibly thin cable, newly lying in the utter-
most depths of two great oceans, to bring to Australia, in an
instant of time, the voices, the messages, and the
images of people from the other side of the world.

Remember the frantic search for the
torch, the screwdriver, the fuse wire?
Then the groping trip to the fuse box
and the dilemma: which fuse was the
culprit? Email has changed all this
with the production of the simple
device you see here—the Westinghouse
Circuit Breaker. It offers even greater
protection than a fuse, yet, with the
flick of the switch, your power is
restored!
It is more than logical that you should
look to Email for a progressive develop-
what happened when the lights went outV
ment like the modern Circuit Breaker.
For Email plays a vital part in the
electrical affairs of this nation. From
generating equipment for giant power
houses through distribution networks to
sub-stations and from there, finally, to
industry and home you will find Email-
built equipment.
Email’s practical contribution is well
evidenced in the electrical world. But
it does not stop here. In a host of other
engineering and manufacturing fields
the many Divisions that are Email are
constantly working to supply the needs
of the growing, thriving nation that is
Australia.

Up the Reedy River
No Peace with Pops
By FRED WELLS
It took the Communist Party nearly
40 years to realise the full potential
of the folksong, but now that folk-
singing is an international vogue, it
exploits it and its singers with remark-
able success.
Back in the 1950 s a folksong book
published by the Communist Party con-
tained such stirring pieces as:
“Comrade Lenin of Russia, high in a
marble tomb,
Move over Comrade Lenin and give
me room.”
It was not until the production of the
musical “Reedy River” by Dick
Diamond, containing a wealth of Aus-
tralian folksongs and ballads, that there
seemed to be a popular breakthrough.
But it was not the songs so much as the
audiences at “Reedy River” which
carried the real message for the Com-
munist Party. I saw the show in both
Melbourne and Sydney a total of six
times and each time the audience was
mainly to be composed of young people,
university students and intellectuals.
Rex Mortimer, lawyer, editor of
“Guardian” and CP Central Committee
member, summed up the situation in the
Marxist quarterly “Arena”: “Foiksingers
find their most stable following in the
under-30 age group who are interested
in peace, racial tolerance, abolition of
capital punishment and similar causes.
Folksong enthusiasts derive heavily from
the ranks of the new strata, students,
technical and semi-professional workers
. . . young industrial workers caught up
are proportionately small. The new
strata, particularly young people, have
grown enormously in recent years. They
don’t think in terms of class alignment
with the industrial workers. They tend
to shy away from unions and political
parties. They are at a point where they
have a deep social need of cohesive
ideas. Folksong helps to supply this
need. On the other hand, the pop-song
mass cult and Beatlemania dwell among
the industrial youth. It is notoriously
difficult to develop sustained interest in
non-economic campaigns among the in-
dustrial youth.”
That the use of folksongs among
youth gives practical results is shown by
the speech which the Victorian Eureka
Youth League leader, Barry Blears,
made to the Party’s 20th Congress: “Last
year and this year the Frankston-to-Mel-
bourne Peace marches show the interest
that young people have in peace, and
the League has played an important role
in this field. One set of youngsters in a
Melbourne suburb have already got
about 70 members in their Peace group
and have attendances of up to 200 at
folk music and coffee nights.”
The “Guardian” in February ran a
story headed “500 at Folk Song Con-
cert” telling of how at the conclusion
of the concert “several young people
from the audience applied to join the
Youth Peace Group organisers of the
evening. Purpose of the concert was to
raise money to finance the group’s
delegate to a Peace conference to be
held in Florence.” Singers at the con-
cert were Martyn Wyndham-Reade, lan
White, David Lumsden, Brian Mooney,
Gary Kinnane and Marian Henderson.
This group, along with Glen Tomasetti,
K. Butcher, Robert Irving, Clem Parkin-
son and of course Gary Shearston, seems
to provide the backbone of foiksingers
performing at similar functions (which
does not mean that any of them are
Communist Party or Eureka Youth
League members).
Folksong concerts have become such
an integral part of peace, protest, youth
and political meetings that folksong
critic Edgar Waters began a recent
article with, “Naturally the Peace Con-
gress in Sydney included a folksong
concert”. Youth Weeks sponsored by
the Trades and Labor Councils are an-
other favorite performing arena for the
folksong.
Many of the Communist Party’s top
cultural cadres are extremely active in
the folksong field. John Manifold, lead-
ing authority on the bush ballad and
folksong, was President of the Federa-
tion of Bush Music Clubs. His book
“Who Wrote the Ballads” established
him as a leading man in the field in Aus-
tralia. The President of the Victorian
Folk Music Club is Miss Shirley Andrews
who at one time or another has been
active in such “front” organisations as
the Australia-Soviet Friendship League
and the Australian Association of
Dancers. Frank Hardy, naturally, has
bought into the creative side of the
business.
But it would appear that somewhere
along the line there has been disagree-
ment with Mortimer’s ideas, and people
have become uneasy at the separation of
industrial workers from this progressive
trend. There are moves now to bring
the trade unions back into the field. The
Building Workers and Waterside Workers
are two cases in point. The Sydney
branch of the wharfies is conducting a
Jim Healey Memorial Folk Song Com-
petition, a condition being that “the song
reflects some phase or phases of Aus-
tralian waterfront, of shipping, port
traditions or history”. The first prize is
to be £75.
As Rex Mortimer says, “We may
expect the current folk wave to be long
drawn out.”

Fashion Off the Hook
The troubles of the volume trade
By JAN SMITH
Women shopping for themselves
have two choices. They can
patronise incredibly pretentious,
over-mirrored and utterly chic little
shops where you can drop your slip in
the boss-lady’s tea dregs (the change-
roms are small), be told Madame has
a lovely figure and get insulted in a dozen
languages by women with three-inch
fingernails.
Or they can go to a big store. There
it’s usually a different story. Madame is
hustled into one of half a hundred
cubicles with an armful of dresses and
left to her own devices. In a wasteland
of three-sided mirrors, no one comes to
convince Madame that her existence is
no more unsightly than the next cus-
tomer's. Hell for once is an absence of
other people.
Everyone admits the volume business
is over-catered for. The department
stores blame the manufacturers and the
manufacturers blame the department
stores. Occasionally someone blames
public taste, the suburban sprawl and
the creeping growth of planned obsoles-
cence. The only people who don’t get
blamed are the teenagers, whose
superior taste, if it holds out, may yet be
the salvation of the trade.
To get a cross-section of opinion on
the volume trade’s troubles I spoke to
four people—a department store execu-
tive, two manufacturers and a clothing
magazine editor. Speaking to the cus-
tomer seemed a waste of time, since I’ve
been one for years.
Mr P. H. Jordan, fashion controller
of David Jones, thinks there’s too
much emphasis on price-undercutting
among manufacturers. “The volume
trade,” said Mr Jordan, “is the gutter
of fashion. They flog clothes without
regard for style and concentrate on
production. Small firms go broke, but
a dozen others come to fill their place.”
Seasonal fluctuations, says Mr Jor-
dan, are a lot of the trouble, and a
long, hot summer and a relatively short,
mild winter result in a periodic rash of
extra part-time labor, involving back-
yard piecework, to cope with the sum-
mer ranges. “Ten years ago our windows
would show a dress and a pair of shoes
both'priced around six or seven pounds.
Today the shoes are up to ten pounds
and the dresses have gone down to
something like four or five pounds.”
Solutions to the bad state of affairs
could include an increase in population,
preferably by the quicker alternative of
migration to give a bigger market and
to even out the fluctuations of seasonal
production which is a peculiar hazard
of the Australian garment industry.
Export seems the best solution. The
introduction of American-style swing
tags, stating the union responsible and
guaranteeing certain standards of work-
manship, might also iron out quality
variations and help eliminate unskilled
piecework by non-union labor.
What, if anything, can be done by the
department stores themselves? Mr Jor-
dan is against indiscriminate sales, and
says David Jones believe in an emphasis
on quality at a normal price, rather
than spectacular reductions. “With the
cost of living rising, people spend less
on clothes but demand better quality,”
Mr Jordan says. “Sales are not the
answer to the problem of getting shop-
pers into the city and spending freely.”
In Emil Hilton's office at John J. Hil-
ton’s there’s a red knitted poodle, two
framed gold medal wool awards, the
a metal plate on the desk saying Loaf-
ing Department, which isn’t strictly true
as the only loafing is done by people
waiting amid the flurry of visiting buy-
ers from the four corners of the con-
tinent to get a word in with the Hiltons.
The 18-year-old firm of John J. Hil-
ton claims it’s the biggest manufacturer
in Australia of middle-price fashion
clothes. Ten per cent of their output is
better quality, selling in the classier end
of department stores and small salons.
It doesn’t show a large profit and is
practised mostly as a prestige venture.
The Hiltons employ about 400 machi-
nists, producing, in the rush season, be-
tween 4000 and 5000 dresses a week—
dropping to 100 a week in the off sea-
son. The 400 girls are divided among
15 factories, each working in specialised
fields. “We try to give them year-round
employment, preparing garments for big
department store sales,” said Emil Hil-
ton, “but unfortunately the sale periods
are not co-ordinated here as they are
overseas.”
Fashion Market Week is the brain-
child of promotions man Bob Coveil,
who left the Chevron last year to handle
publicity for Menzies Hotel. Long used
to trade conventions in the United
States, Mr Covell hopes to extend his
efforts into the millinery, shoe and
accessory trade, and, with typical Ameri-
can bewilderment, wonders why no one
has done it before. “Businessmen in Aus-
tralia live on a tight little island,” says
Mr Covell. “They haven’t learnt the
advantages of getting together with the
next fellow. They’re overly cautious and
economically self-centred.”
A second manufacturer, Mr Roy
Taffs, is firmly on the side of Market
Week. Whether it is actually his baby or
Mr Covell’s is something no blood test
in the world will settle, but as Mr Taffs
has already conceived the Design Award
and a plan for a super-cemetery, he is
obviously not a man short of ideas.
Mr Taffs thinks there has been an
improvement in standards over the last
ten years, both here and overseas, but
over-competition rules out any advan-
tages. As clothes remain the same price
as ten years ago despite a rise in costs,
something is obviously being sacrificed.
“Quality is expendable when every
stitch must be calculated in the final
cost of a garment,” says Mr Taffs. “We
are constantly working to keep costs
down, because we know we cannot sell
above a certain price.”
Export, he believes, is the only solu-
tion, and his firm already sends gar-
ments to Singapore, Bangkok, Japan and
the West Coast of America. “But ex-
port cannot succeed without an image
behind it,” he said.
The women’s mass clothing trade is
catered for by three magazines, “Clothing
News”, “Fashion News” and “Fashion
Week”, and it is here, from people like
“Clothing News” editor Len Richardson,
that the nearest thing to an impartial
opinion can be found. Eighteen years of
editorial crises and champagne lun-
cheons have given Mr Richardson a rare
knowledge of Sydney’s fashion world.
“The biggest trouble with the industry
is the compulsion to produce enormous
ranges,” says Mr Richardson, and he
feels most manufacturers will agree
with him. It’s the same in America, but
it’s no consolation for the small local
maker who must show as many as 50
dresses for no other apparent reason
than that everyone else is doing the
same thing.

Judith Wright
Her Year
Involment in everything
By THOMAS SHAPCOTT
The presentation of the £5OOO Brit-
tanica Literary Award for 1964 to
the poet Judith Wright should do
a lot towards re-focusing attention upon
her work. Not that she could ever claim
to have been a neglected poet, of course,
but there has been, over the last few
years, a noticeable increase in patronis-
ing attitudes towards her; no doubt this
is partly as a result of the position of
Sacred Cow which had been so early
thrust upon her, almost from the pub-
lication of her first book, “The Moving
Image” in 1946. It is always dangerous
to become an Institution, particularly in
Australia. Younger critic types with a
furiously professional glint in their eyes,
automatically aim their volleys of Know-
ledgeable Scorn at such figures (Oh, the
fearless generalisations of our Evan
Joneses!); and rapidly middle-ageing
Great Young Promises, forgetting their
poetry for their public profiles, cannot
forgive her or her like) for being their
contemporary, and still creating. The
Academic Industry, of course, always
ready to ticket, parcel and consign away,
found a label for Judith Wright a decade
ago and as her work has remained true
to her standards since, has largely let it
go at that. When “Live Senses”, the
first comprehensive selection of her
poems, was published at the end of
1963, its appearance was virtually
ignored by most of the literary journals.
Yet the volume was a record of achieve-
ment in its way quite as commanding as
that of A. D. Hope’s celebrated “Poems”
in 1961.
In Queensland, where she has lived
now for many years, she has been part of
the accepted literary background long
enough for people to take a sort of
family pride in her the sort of family
pride, that is, which one has for some
relative who is spoken well of by “those
who know”, but the exact nature of
whose achievement is never really in-
vestigated. The tourist buses to Mt
Tambourine point out her home. The
visiting celebrities make their pilgrimage.
(“Have you seen the rain forest? Have
you seen Judith Wright?”) The local
newspapers seek her advice on high
literary matters. (“When asked her
opinion on Abridged Classics for second-
ary schools, Judith Wright, the well-
known poet, of Tambourine, said . . .”)
There are any number of women of
culture in Brisbane only too happy to
drop the name of Judith Wright into
the conversation, though their only
knowledge of her actual verse is per-
haps “Bora Ring” which little Gaylene
“did” for the Eisteddfod. Television inter-
viewers, carefully hogging the camera,
flatter and patronise tier. (“And how do
you spend your day, Miss Wright?”)
School children, because there might be
one examination question on Aust. Lit.
in their Senior or Leaving paper,
memorise her name as part of a cata-
logue.
what is the effect of these things
upon Judith Wright herself? Anyone
who has been fortunate enough to meet
her informally is immediately impressed
both by her poise and level headedness,
and by her immediate interest and in-
volvement in everything and everyone
around her. Southerners who talk or
write knowingly about her “retreat to an
ivory tower" up in the rain forest (per-
haps they think of one of those giant
strangling figs?), do not realise that from
her admirable position on the heights of
North Tambourine she still maintains a
level of involvement with things which
really matter which would shame most
southern intellectuals. In the last year
or so, for instance, the energies of Judith
Wright have been largely responsible for
the saving of the famous colored sands
of Noosa from beach mining, as well as
for the interests of wild life preservation
and the formation of a regular magazine
on the subject.
Her poetry, at its most characteristic,
reflects the woman admirably: intense
and unquenchable in her search for the
truth of her vocation; unconcerned with
the irrelevancies of current fashions, she
grapples in isolation with .her need to
bare all things to their fundamentals. A
woman who is alone, but too aware
ever to equate her state with loneliness.
Physically, a woman in the full richness
and maturity of her middle age; as the
Brittanica citation said of her: she is
now at the very height of her powers.


OVERSEAS
The End of the
Sino-Soviet Split?
Chou’s visit to Moscow
By EMERY BARCS
En-lai’s unexpected mission to
Moscow for the 47th anniversary
celebrations of the Russian Revolution
may force the West to re-think most of
its optimistic plans about future develop-
ments in East-West relations.
These plans were based on the
assumption that (a) the Sino-Soviet rift
will deepen because the real reasons for
the quarrel are not ideological but
geopolitical and power-political; (b) as
a result the Chinese will go on wreck-
ing international Communist solidarity
and threaten Moscow’s position as the
most equal among equals; and (c) the
Kremlin, and perhaps even Peking, will
become more accommodating to the
West, to avoid a two-front diplomatic
cold war.
Only last week French Premier
Georges Pompidou and Foreign Minister
Maurice Couve de Murville, reflecting
the ideas of President Charles de
Gaulle, went on record in two separate
speeches saying that the split between
“rich” Russia and “poor” Red China
cannot be healed. “These divergencies
or this conflict of interest,” Pompidou
said, “is even further increased when
one knows that immense human masses
are looking for land for their expansion
and see within their reach as the natural
land of expansion precisely the Soviet
land Soviet land which is little in-
habited.
“And which is vastly uninhabitable,”
one may add. The Chinese have plenty
of more land for expansion at less pro-
hibitive cost in Tibet than there is in
Siberia. Peking may make its historical
claims to certain Soviet areas as long
as the Sino-Soviet feud lasts, but Red
China's expansionist ambitions are in
the direction of the ricebowls of South-
East Asia, not towards the barren
tundras of the north. Territorial claims
are the least important parts of the
conflict between the two Communist
giants.
Mao Tse-tung’s quarrel with Mr
Khrushchev had two main roots:
Khrushchev’s breaking of his promise
to help Red China’s growth to full
nuclear adulthood and his refusal to
include Mao into Communist-bloc nego-
tiations with the West. Khrushchev’s
meeting with President Eisenhower at
Camp David in late 1959 was probably
the final incident that convinced Mao
that there was no chance of a partner-
ship between himself and the bouncing
little Ukrainian.
President Cbiang Kai-shek told ir.e in
March, 1963, that “the existing dispute
[between Russia and Red China] is
largely due to a personal struggle be-
tween Khrushchev and Mao for the
leadership of international Communism.
To them this is far more important than
differences between the Soviet and
Chinese Communist Parties. Mao and
Khrushchev will find it difficult to mend
their differences, but the Parties of the
two countries will not remain hostile
to each other.”
I found little sympathy for his hypo-
thesis among some of the world's lead-
ing diplomats at the time, and yet Presi-
dent Chiang might have been right. For
three weeks after Khrushchev's ouster
Red China’s top travelling political
salesman was on his way to Moscow.
At the time of writing only a brief
hint (in the communique issued after
the recent “explanatory meeting” be-
tween Khrushchev's successors and
Austrian Communist leaders) indicated
that the Russians wanted to go ahead
with calling together on December 15
the Preparatory Committee of 26 Com-
munist Parties which should discuss the
World Communist Conference planned
by Khrushchev for mid-1965.
Invitations for December 15 went to
the 13 Communist Governments in
power (Russia, Poland, East Germany,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Rumania,
Bulgaria, Albania, Red China, North
Korea, North Vietnam, Mongolia and
Cuba) and to the Communist Parties of
Argentina, Australia, Brazil, West Ger-
many, Finland, France, Britain, India,
Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Syria and the
US.
There was, of course, no chance that
Red China and its three satellites
Albania, North Korea and North Viet-
nam would participate. Now they
may have changed their minds. And if
the December gathering of the 26 is
held to prepare the monster conference
next year, and if the Peking Group
participates in it, then the West will
have to start thinking again about the
“permanent Sino-Soviet split” on which
it has based so many plans.
Indonesia Gets its Missile
"We feel we are dreaming"
By FRANK PALMOS
Indonesian Defence officials have re-
-*■ acted swiftly to China’s A-bomb
experiments. The Chinese explosion
was the signal for an announcement that
Indonesia had not only half-completed
“the biggest arms factory in Asia”, but
had developed a new missile.
More surprising was a statement that
the Indonesian Army had been making
contact with the Philippine’s Army
leaders with the object of supplying arms
from the new factory.
The Army chose to make these dis-
closures through the influential fort-
nightly “Sketsmasa” (Time Sketch) which
has long been considered the PR outlet
for the Armed Forces. (Its national cir-
culation of nearly 100,000 is ten times
that of any other political magazine.)
“Sketsmasa” quoted the Army as say-
ing that PINDAD, the Army's munitions
and industrial arm, already had a factory
“somewhere in West Java” making arms.
Together with the output of the new fac-
tory (“somewhere in East Java”) Indo-
nesia would soon be “self-supporting in
weapons and ammunition”.
The new guided missile is “startling”
according to the Army. (It was made
by the same technicians who helped
build Indonesia’s first jet engine earlier
this year. Now they are being turned
out at the rate of five a month, which is
quarter capacity, according to the Air
Force.) The missile is called AYI, after
the Army’s Chief of Staff, Achmad Yani.
“Sketsmasa” reported: “To keep up
with technological advances, our experts
were continually wracking their brains.
They wanted a weapon which was light,
yet powerful enough to knock out a
tank or bring down a plane. They
came up with the AYl—something
which compares with anything the
Imperialists/Colonialists possess.
“Remembering that our Army was
established only 19 years ago, we feel
we are dreaming when we see the kind
of equipment being used today.”

London
President Johnson's victory has
disappointed more than the fol-
lowers of ex-Senator Goldwater.
The ones who, in their hearts, are most
chagrined at the result are those outside
America (and especially in Britain) who
resent not only America’s huge power,
success, affluence and leadership, but
even more her wisdom, maturity and
stability.
Among the sillier Left-wing intel-
lectuals in Britain there is a profound
conviction that Americans are nothing
but a bunch of trigger-happy, pill-
swallowing, psychiatrist-haunting, Com-
mie-baiting, red-necked hillbillies, quite
unfit to be trusted with the manage-
ment of their own affairs, let alone those
of the whole free world.
When President Kennedy was elected
(most of them, incidentally, though they
have long since managed to forget this,
were bitterly opposed to Kennedy at
the time of the 1960 nomination cam-
paign, being automatic Stevensonians)
they basked in what they regarded as
their own reflected glory. There, one
could hear them saying, goes one of us,
an intellectual. (It was Truman, not
Kennedy, who used to quote Cicero, but
Truman was manifestly not one of us,
and anyway, we don’t read Cicero our-
selves.)
Then Kennedy was assassinated.
Naturally, they formed themselves into
a Who Killed Kennedy? committee and
talked about “the sickness in American
Society”. The “New Statesman” had a
long article by its Deputy Editor called
“America: The Sick Giant” Miss Dee
Wells stood by to disbelieve in the
Warren Commission Report, on the
grounds that she had once met Major-
General Walker and he didn’t strike her
as a man who would get things wrong.
The staggering legislative success of
President Johnson was the bitterest blow
they had yet suffered. Johnson was so
obviously not one of us, yet he was
doing the things we thought he ought
to do.
Wearily, they prepared to do their
duty: to save America from Goldwater.
They began by calling him a Fascist,
went on to call him “sincere” (an even
worse form of abuse) and began to argue
that Americans, being, to a man and a
’ A , t i ,
woman, members of the John Birch
’
Society, could not be trusted not to elect
~’,, , . , ,
him. Only we knew him for what he
was the unwitting tool of the sickness
in American society.
Then the Americans elected Johnson
with an enormous majority. And any
minute now there is going to be a spate
°f articles and letters to the Press point-
ou* Goldwater got 26 million
Y° tes .’ so must be that number of
ascists in merica. Which is very
nearly a majority, after all. In fact,
', • .
Goldwater won a moral victory.
T a j u ■ , „.■■■
Indeed, Goldwater is, to all intents
and purposeSj p res ident. Good grief,
look at those crazy Americans, electing
Goldwater by that enormous majorityl
If only they had listened to us!

Sincerity, Cliche, Ruckus
Left colder than the Alps
From MAURICE SHADROLT in Auckland
What should have been one of this
country's cultural events of the
year the first New Zealand-
made feature film in a dozen years
has turned out to be a cruel disappoint-
ment.
Written by Auckland playwright John
Graham, produced and directed by
veteran Wellington professional John
O'Shea, "Runaway” aroused hopes as
possibly the first of several feature films
to be made by Pacific Films until
this year a firm which specialised in
sponsored documentaries and TV com-
mercials. It cost some £50,000 to make.
One or two actors were imported, ap-
parently for reasons of local publicity,
from England and Australia.
Lively talents from other creative
fields contributed to the film again,
perhaps, arousing false hope. Distin-
guished Maori artist Selwyn Muru plays
a small but important role: so, too, does
New Zealand’s rough, tough bush-whack-
ing writer Barry Crump. In the event,
these two turned in the most convincing
performances of the film; their sincerity
emphasised the cliches of script and
direction, and the scrappy playing of
O’Shea’s mixed band of amateur, and
professional actors. The film was scored
by Robir Maconie, one of the country’s
most promising young composers.
The story for whai it is worth
concerns a young Aucklander who walks
out on the city rat-race (after cashing
some of his firm’s cheques) and roams
the countryside converting cars, sleeping
with women, and getting into even more
trouble with the police. In the process
we are given a fair look at New Zea-
land’s landscape, from the hot sandhills
of the north to the cold mountains of
the south, but landscape has never saved
a film yet; and certainly not this one,
since the makers of the film failed sig-
nally to take advantage of natural set-
tings, and to relate people to the land-
scape. There is a total blank where the
young hero should be; scriptwriter and
director apparently relied upon the senti-
mental convention of the angry young
man to see them through. In the end they
abandon him entirely: to the sound of
vaguely sacred music he is turned loose
in the snows of the Southern Alps, to face
almost certain death. Presumably we are
supposed to care about this, but in fact,
since we fail to care about the rather
contemptible young runaway, we are left
colder than the Alps. When all due
allowances have been made, it is diffi-
cult to see what else could have been
done with a character and a story so thin
and absurd; it probably was a good idea
to let landscape take over.
Even on the level of simple credibility
the story often falls down: Auckland
audiences howled with laughter in the
wrong places.
'VTevertheless, the film's distributors
have announced that they are com-
pleting arrangements for exhibition of
the film in England, Australia and the
USA. Possibly the curiosity of New Zea-
landers about the film will mean that
costs are recovered in this country alone.
For John O’Shea, however, “Runaway”
represents a step back from his first
feature film, “Broken Barrier”, a study
in race relations made on a tiny budget,
and with immense technical difficulty,
back in 1952.
When the patriotic tom-toms have
stopped beating from the North Cape
to the Bluff, and “Runaway” has been
forgotten, it is to be hoped that he will
have a third chance to prove himself
as a feature film-maker; meanwhile the
rest of us must face the fact that, a cer-
tain amount of professional competence
aside, New Zealand-made feature films
have not progressed one inch since the
first were made forty or fifty years ago.
The professional competence is easily
explained; in documentary work New
Zealand film-makers have often enough
taken their place with the world's best.
Most of this has come from the Govern-
ment-controlled National Fiim Unit in
Wellington which the father of docu-
mentary film, John Grierson, helped
found back in 1940. But former staff
members are now directing features in
England, making documentaries in
Canada, or shooting stills for
“Life” magazine. Frustration appears to
account for most defections from the
Unit this year has seen another rash
of them and its work has noticeably
declined in quality; only one or two
directors of worth remain. In its hey-
day, though, the Unit did more than
give New Zealanders a sense of them-
selves, according to John Grierson’s pre-
cepts; it also gave outsiders a vivid
sense of New Zealand. On both counts
as well as on the dramatic level
“Runaway” fails sadly.
A photographic documentary of an-
other kind produced a minor crisis at
Government level recently; it also gave
some insight into the sensitivity of New
Zealanders about racial matters.
Published by the Education Depart-
ment for use in schools, the work in
question, a thin booklet titled “Wash-
day at the Pa”, tells the story in
pictures and words of a day in the
life of a happy and healthy Maori family
in the back Country of the North Island.
It is a wholly delightful piece of
reportage from a recently - naturalised
New Zealander, 28 - year - old Dutch-
woman Ans Westra.
The family shown is scarcely affluent
(no refrigerator, no washing machine,
not even an electric stove) but typical
enough of many rural Maori families.
They live in a rather decrepit farmhouse
but, as one illustration makes clear, they
are about to shift into a spanking new
home with mod. cons, up the road. The
point of the book, however, is not to
be found in material circumstance; it is
in the joy of living which shines out on
every page. Author Westra explained
that her aim was to show “the warmth
of family relationship”.
The ruckus began in—of all unlikely
places Dunedin, at a national con-
ference of the Maori Women's Welfare
Teague. Though apparently only a hand-
ful of the 300 women at the conference
had in fact seen the book, the entire
conference denounced it as degrading
to the Maori race. The president of the
league described Miss Westra’s journal-
ism as “somewhat perverted”.
Objection was taken to a number of
things, including the Maori children
being shown barefoot; and the identifica-
tion of a particular Maori family (by
now settled comfortably in their com-
pleted State house) as coming from sub-
standard conditions.
But according to one reliable report
the real though officially unstated
objection to the book was that a Maori
toddler appeared without trousers in a
photograph; his sexual organ was only
partially obscured.
The Anglican Dean of Dunedin leapt
into the controversy with the perplexing
pronouncement that the inference to be
drawn from the book was that Maoris

lived in lower standards of housing than
other New Zealanders.
This happens to be the plain truth: in
general Maoris do live in lower stan-
dards of housing than other New Zea-
landers. To be fair, however, the Dean
may not have been indulging in the
national habit of self-deception about
racial matters; he lives in an area where
Maoris are few and far between.
Minister of Education Arthur Kin-
sella reacted immediately. He ordered
the book removed from schools and
instructed the Government Printer to
guillotine some 38,000 copies.
Defending his action, Mr Kinsella
said the book had become a contentious
issue, and it was undesirable that child-
ren should become involved in such
issues. He added that he did not want to
make out that New Zealand was a clinic-
ally pure society, but the book did not
give a true picture: “It was not com-
pletely typical".
Schoolteachers were vocal about the
withdrawal. One acquaintance of mine—
a prominent writer on Maori themes as
well as a teacher of backward Maori
children —described the book as the best
thing the Education Department had
ever produced. He said the response
from his children had been extraordinary;
for the first time they had an official
publication which interested them, some-
thing really close to their own lives.
1%/f aori journalist Harry Dansey, writing
in the “Auckland Star”, said he had
found it impossible to locate anything
offensive in the book. He thought mem-
bers of the Maori Women's Welfare
League had confused the principles of
good home management with the
machines which can be used to achieve
it.
An education columnist demanded:
“Why should we, the public, expect
school books always to publicise the
middle-class way of life?”
But there was no room for appeal;
nothing could save “Washday at the Pa”
from the guillotine. Since then, the
Education Department has gone out of
its way to deter private publishers from
reprinting the book; threats that it will
never again be allowed in schools
even on library shelves apparently
decided two major firms against re-pub-
lishing.
It seems that even though New Zea-
land may not be “clinically pure”, in
the words of the Minister, the country’s
bureaucracy is determined to make it so.
A small South Island firm, Caxton
Press, finally took re-publication of the
book, despite financial risk, upon itself
as a matter of principle. A spokesman
for the publisher pointed out that the
phrase “not typical” was dominant
through all the objections raised to the
book, and observed: “We do not hear

objections when another Government
Department sends photographs around
the world showing Maori women in
flax skirts, cooking and washing in hot
pools. These ladies are not “typical”
either, but they meet with approval.
They are, of course, a lie. They have
neither artistic nor objective truth. Have
we here a clue to the puzzle of this con-
troversy? Was it simply because Miss
Westra’s little book was a work of art
and possessed artistic truth that it made
people feel uncomfortable?”
'VTevertheless, the entire affair does
' point up one important truth: that
the Maori race through its official
spokesman anyway is becoming more
concerned about its image, in the literal
as well as the public relations sense of
the word. Maoris have approached the
Auckland City Council to protest at the
commissioning of a piece of sculpture
a figure of a Maori chief to sit at the
foot of Queen Street without their
permission. Another group of Maoris,
further north, is said to be contemplating
legal action against the author of a New
Zealand novel set in their district.
These acts, like the protests which led
to the removal of “Washday at the Pa”
from schools, are essentially negative. So
it is a pleasure to report that the past
month has also seen something more
positive in the way of Maori emergence
in the arts. Though the Maoris were
once acclaimed as a race of poets, we
have had to wait more than a hundred
years for a Maori poet of any con-
sequence to speak directly in the English
language.
Hone Tuwhare’s remarkable first book
of poems, “No Ordinary Sun”, released
during New Zealand Book Week in mid-
October and already sold out, was a
notable event. Tuwhare, a gentle yet
tough-minded 42-year-old boilermaker,
draws strength from traditional Maori
material but also writes on contemporary
themes; his title poem, recently drama-
tised for television, concerns the Bomb.
At the same time Auckland galleries
have featured three major exhibitions by
Maori artists. Two, Para Matchitt and
Selwyn Muru, are home-grown Maoris.
The third, Paul Tangata, a Cook Island
Maori, is now resident in New Zealand.
The three contrast remarkably. Matchitt
works towards abstraction of traditional
forms; Tangata flaunts something of the
color of his native islands; Muru paints
rainy pig-island landscapes in dour
shades.
A fourth exhibition, just announced,
will feature the work of a Samoan pri-
mitive: it is clear that, whether its more
sober citizens care for the idea or not,
Auckland is staggering in the direction
of becoming the cultural capital of
Polynesia.

Australia’s Bishops at the Council
Theologians versus financiers
YOUNG, intellectual
O BRIEN, prbgressive
McAULEY, layman
MULDOON, theologian
GILROY, administrator
By JOHN BRODIE
Already a murmur has sounded
around the wings at Vatican II that
a Hamlet sits in the Chair of Peter.
A cloak of indecision has been placed
upon the shoulders of Giovanni Battista
Montini, Pope Paul VI. But to no avail,
we hold, since from the first days of
Vatican II the spirit and mind of Pope
John has been the majority and articu-
late voice of the bishops. It is still, and
will remain, a Council of open windows
and fresh breezes. And Paul will
emerge, in the light of his talents,
especially, by way of his rich pastoral
experience as Archbishop of Milan, a
faithful disciple of Johannine liberality.
All too obviously it is apparent that
an Ecumenical Council is no walkover.
An organisation like the Catholic
Church has a lush growth of medieval-
ism clinging to its walls. The demands
of up-dating and change are obvious,
except, of course, to a large number of
the Fathers in Council and those of th 6
same conservative ilk among the faith-
ful.
Change comes hard to the Catholic
Church, and many bishops, particularly
those in the twilight of their lives
there are notable exceptions simply
will not believe that the modern world,
and especially modern theologians,
have anything to offer the childlike
image of the church that has loyally
stood the test of years for them.
An Australian may well ask what
bearing the present Vatican Council
has on Catholicism in this country.
Rome and the Vatican seem far re-
moved from Australia, and our way of
doing things. But over the last two years
some 30 Roman Catholic bishops from
Australia have been attending the
sessions of the Vatican Council. The
bishops in Council number 2500, and
they claim the spiritual allegiance of
some 500 million Catholics in union
with Rome.
The 30 bishops who leave these
shores to attend Vatican II can well
claim to be the spiritual representatives
and pastors of nearly 4 million Aus-
tralian Catholics. It is fair comment,
then, to maintain that the future face
of the Catholic Church in Australia is
being moulded in the light of what is
happening at Vatican II
This is the general principle of things,
but much will depend on how the bish-
ops implement the spirit of the Council
in their own dioceses. Already the work
of Vatican II has penetrated into the
life of the church in Australia. A major
change in the celebration of the mass,
principally by way of Latin bowing out
to English, has had a much varied look
from place to place. It is of interest,
that more English in the mass is per-
mitted by Archbishop Eris O’Brien in
Canberra than by Cardinal Gilroy in
Sydney. While in Ballarat the limits
placed on English are, as yet, most
severe.
Bishops are human
permission for priests to use
an English breviary for the daily
office is granted freely by some bishops;
yet other bishops rigidly oppose such
concessions, which are the basic fruits
of Vatican 11.
Human nature and Adam’s sin, as
Catholic theology shouts from the roof-
tops, have left a hefty black mark on
each of us. And no theologian worth
his salt would dare to exempt bishops
from this common malady. Hence,
bishops are human like the rest ot us:
some are theologians; others are admini-
strators; and some just happen to be
bishops. However, at Vatican 11, all the
bishops, seemingly, end up as conser-
vatives or progressives.
In point of honorific prestige, Car-
dinal Gilroy of Sydney is the most
notable Australian attending Vatican 11.
And Pope John gave note to Cardinal
Gilroy’s rank when he named the
Roman Catholic Archbishop of Sydney
a member of the ten-man Council
presidency. But a chuckle was raised
among the local cognoscenti, when
“Time” reporter, Mr Robert Kaiser,
listed Cardinal Gilroy among the pro-
gressives. Cardinal Gilroy is a meticu-
lous administrator. This is the mission
of the Cardinal to the Catholic Church
in Australia, plus, of course, an old-
style Irish piety. The Cardinal is not a
theologian. He has not the bent or in-
clination towards philosophy or specu-
lative thought, the handmaids of
meaningful theology. If Rome lays
down the norms, Norman Thomas
Cardinal Gilroy will see that they are
carried out.
By way of preparation for the
Council, Cardinal Gilroy has used the
swashbuckling Bishop Thomas Muldoon,
of Sydney, as his personal theologian.
This is a wise move, and is common
procedure with the episcopal luminaries
at the Council. Theologians of world
repute like Rahner, Kung, Congar,
Danielou and others have the prurient
ears of willing and eager cardinals
and bishops.
It is of considerable interest that the
grey eminence of the Catholic Church
in Sydney, Bishop James Carroll, an

auxiliary to Cardinal Gilroy, like Bishop
Muldoon, has indicated little affection
for the seasonal trippings to Rome. In
any dispassionate assessment, Bishop
Carroll must be tallied as one of the
few talented churchmen that Catholi-
cism has produced in Australia. He is
an outstanding canonist, and his charm
of manner and bearing envelop him in
an aura of fascinating interest. The
added fact, that Bishop Carroll swims
politically with the NSW Labor Party,
has triggered off his role to gargantuan
proportions in assessing the strength of
Catholicism in Australia at the present
time.
In any proper assessment, however,
of the Australian bishops at Vatican 11,
Archbishop Guilford Young of Hobart
must, by any fair reckoning, be con-
sidered as this country’s outstanding
representative. The extraordinary in the
career of Dr Young came into play in
1948. It was in July of that year that
Dr Young became a bishop, and, in
fact, he was the youngest bishop in the
world; being then a 31-year-old prelate.
Matinee idol
A charismatic image surrounded Dr
Guilford Young in the years of the
late ’forties. Nature had endowed the
young bishop most lavishly. Dr 'Young
was a man of mammoth intellect and
spell-binding oratory; dashingly set off
with a matinee-idol appearance, and an
exuberant personality. But his youth
and manner told against him; especially
in the assessments of the senior and
less colorful members of the hierarchy.
Then, in 1955, Dr Young succeeded
Archbishop Tweedy in the See of Ho-
bart. Now, in the independence of his
own diocese, he was able to put into
effect the progressive ideas for which
he was already noted. These years in
Tasmania have seen Archbishop
Young hard at his homework. And
when Pope John convened fhe Council,
Dr Young went to Rome, eager and
intent for reform.
An advantage that Archbishop
Young enjoys at the Council is that,
primarily, he is a theologian. And
theology, in spite of Cardinal Ottaviani
and the Curia, is the touchstone at Vati-
can 11. The lack of a theology of our
times has been the downfall of the
Curia and the conservative bishops;
hence, it is of deep interest that Eng-
lish-speaking bishops are not, in the
main, theologians. Anyone mildly
acquainted with such affairs is vividly
conscious of the American bishop cum
businessman.
The necessity for more theologians to
occupy the episcopal benches is a topic
of subdued conversation among Aus-
tralian Catholics at the present time.
This opinion holds that the Catholic
Church in Australia is top-heavy on
fund-raising and administration, but
low-water mark on spirituality and in-
tellectual maturity.
But high hopes can be mustered that
the theological excellence displayed by
many at the. Council will filter back to
these far-off shores. The progressive and
informed leadership is, at present, in
the hands of Archbishop Guilford
Young; fortunately, however, there are
quality disciples in Bishop Rush of
Rockhampton; Bishop Cullinane, Auxil-
iary to Archbishop Eris O'Brien of
Canberra-Goulburn; and the Bavarian-
born Bishop John Jobst, Vicar Apos-
tolic of the Kimberleys.
It is of interest, that in December,
1962, at the conclusion of the first
session of Vatican 11, observers made
ready mention of the minor role played
in the Council debates by the English-
speaking bishops. This caused a good
amount of soul-searching, mostly
among informed lay Catholics in the

United States. It was commonly held
that the Irish origins of the church in
America had placed limitations on
efforts for intellectual excellence.
This study and interpretation of Irish
origins in English-speaking Catholicism
is, also, a vivid reality of the Catholic
Church in Australia. The Irish immig-
rant brought to these shores a combin-
ation of fervent religion and intense
Irish nationalism; it could be, and often
was, a powerful brew. But it was much
removed from the Catholicism of Car-
dinal Newman or, for that matter, the
articulate theology that sounds around
the walls of St Peter’s, Rome, during
Vatican 11.
Both at home and abroad, Irish
Catholicism carries a distinctive mark of
clerical paternalism. The historical roots
of a Father Knows Best brand of Catho-
licism are simple: the brutal poverty of
Irish Catholics in the 19th century gave
rise to the priest-hero in the popular
Irish image. This same clerical paternal-
ism was taken abroad, especially, during
the exodus after the Great Famine to
America, England and Australia.
But such a limited view of the Church
cannot be sustained, and in recent years,
especially in this time of tertiary educa-
tion, the emergence by the layman from
the silent, back pews is becoming a
reality; and the Church will gain new
vigor from the articulate voices and
devotion of the laity.
Someone may well say that such a view
is contrary to the spirit of Vatican 11.
But this is not true. Primarily, the
bishops at the Council are the represen-
tatives of 500 million Catholics; and we
should be mindful that there are only
some 2500 bishops. Hence, in point
of numbers bishops, priests and religious
are minor in the overall strength of the
church.
Layman s inheritance
this is borne in mind in the utter-
ances of bishops like Cardinal
Suenens of Belgium, Cardinal Alfrink of
Holland, Cardinal Lienart of France,
Cardinal Doepfner of Western Germany.
These prelates are simply the voices of
many bishops in Council that are speak-
ing for and on behalf of the layman
getting his rightful inheritance: an adult
and responsible life in the church.
The theme of a mature and adult laity
can no longer be fobbed off; already the
voices of Vincent Buckley, Max Charles-
worth, James McAuley and William Gin-
nane have been heard in our land.
In a fashion, Vatican II is a giant
stocktaking in the Catholic Church. And
Catholicism in Australia is part of this
enterprise; and looking about us in this
country, a surprising change is noticed
upon the old face of the Catholic Church.
The twenty years of waiting for Arch-
bishop Simonds has ended; now, in Mel-
bourne, political diddling has been ex-
orcised from the official list of Catholic
activities.
But there is no feeling of gloom in the
Catholic body; the rotund figure and
smiling warmth of Pope John still glows
in certain Catholic places. This is not,
of course, the foolish triumphalism of the
diocesan Press, and the sentimentalities
that all religions must carry: but an
ecumenist spirit that spells out concern
for peace, world hunger, civil rights,
liberty of conscience for all, the popu-
lation explosion and all those things that
concern, or should, men of good will.
After the Council, the church in
Australia will have a busy agenda.
Observers have expressed concern that
younger theologians, especially those
teaching in the seminaries, have not
been given the opportunity to “feel” the
atmosphere at Vatican 11.
And more will be heard about the
Pill; up to the present, a glaring lack of
sympathy, in direct contrast with many
overseas bishops and theologians, has
been displayed in the official statements
listed in the Australian diocesan Press;
nevertheless, it is » problem of high
importance to an ever-increasing num-
ber of Catholics.
While it is obvious that the final de-
cision on the Pill hinges outside Aus-
tralia, the Australian bishops now, and
in the immediate future, have items of
importance that they themselves can,
and must, decide if the Council is to
have a proper and worthwhile effect
on Australian Catholicism. An unfetter-
ed dialogue on the role and purpose of
education, especially in the parochial
schools and seminaries, is, in the minds
of the aware and alert, the top priority
that the Church in Australia must face.
Hence, a recent American study, “Are
Parochial Schools the Answer?” by Mary
Perkins Ryan (Holt, Rinehart and Win-
ston), is worthy of our interest, since the
United States and Australia are part of
the same parochial brew. The parochial
schools’ system, according to the author,
gorges down the bulk of parish funds
and labor. In these circumstances the
mission of the Church becomes stunted,
and cut-off from the mainspring of re-
sponsible adult activities, since it con-
cerns itself, almost exclusively, in the
limited needs and wants of six-to-sixteen-
year-olds.
The seminaries are a second bone of
contention in Catholic education. A rich
dialogue would emerge, at the present
time, if informed priests and laymen
were given the opportunity to speak
freely on the inadequacies of rote learn-
ing in the philosophical and theological
faculties of the seminaries. And further,
in the minds of keen observers, the pre-
sent recruitment of candidates for the
priesthood is too confined and limited
for the challenge religion must face in
the modern world. The bishops must
look beyond the 16-to-l 9-year-olds as
the prime material for the adult and life-
long vocation to the celibate priesthood
of the Catholic Church.
In summary, the words of a young
American layman, Mr Michael Novak,
tell the story of Vatican II: “Yet it is
not on the level of sensibility or law, or
even morality that the closed church
can best be understood. On these levels,
passion waxes too hot, and the argument
is useless. The stronghold of the closed
church is its theology, complacent in
its possession of the absolute truth, full
of tears about other ways of pursuing
understanding. The men who love the
splendor of papal Rome, the clarity of
Roman law, the absoluteness of non-
historical theology, are not despicable,
mean, or uncouth men. They are men
who have tried to live outside history.
They are good men, victims of the system
they faithfully and loyally serve. It is
not that they are bad they are merely
out of touch. If the opening of the
church means anything, it means dis-
placing their system from the centre of
the church.”

Letters to the Editor
“ Peace" Congress
SlR.—Your report on the “Peace”
Congress (The Bulletin 7/11/64) did
not sufficiently document Communist
manipulation of the Citizens’ Conference.
At least three types of policy were evi-
dent.
(1) Organisationally, the structure
of the Conference was designed to en-
sure that power remained in the hands
of the organisers. When we (the dele-
gates) arrived for the first session on
Monday we were handed a 2-page fool-
scap sheet containing “Recommend-
ations regarding Management and Pro-
cedure”. This indicated who were the
Officers and members of the Confer-
ence Management Committee (“appoint-
ed by and responsible to the National
Committee" of the Congress elected
three months earlier). This Manage-
ment Committee then itself appointed
at least one-half of the Findings Com-
mittee which was to aim at “summaris-
ing the main points of discussion by
delegates". Also the Management Com-
mittee appointed the Chairmen of each
of the five Conference discussion units,
called “Commissions”. In three cases,
members of the Management Commit-
tee appointed themselves to the Find-
ings Committee. It became obvious that
this autocratic committee superstruc-
ture, however unrepresentative, was
firmly in control.
An attempt by myself to make the
key Findings Committee more repres-
entative by the election of one more
person from each Commission on to it
(i.e., five more) was rejected by the
Conference on the advice of the Chair-
man, the Reverend Alf Dickie, who
told Conference that this move would
make the Committee “too unwieldy”.
Since the “Recommendations” also laid
down that “no resolutions shall be put
at these sessions” until the two-hour
Thursday meeting, the 450 delegates
were powerless. We could all chatter on
each morning for a straight three
hours, but the responsibility of “sum-
marising the discussion” remained with
the Findings Committee.
And this power was used when neces-
sary. On Monday in Commission No. 2,
I began a discussion on the lack of
freedom in Russia to distribute pacifist
propaganda and instanced a case in
which pacifists in Moscow had had
their literature seized and posters torn
apart by the Soviet authorities. I spoke
for fully 15 minutes on the situation in
the USSR concerning conscientious
pacifists. Then our sole representative
on the Findings Committee told the 90-
odd gathering in one prefatory sentence
that as a member of the Queensland
CND she knew that this body could not
issue CND literature in Brisbane without
a police licence. So the summary of the
discussion issued to the Conference next
morning read as follows: “Complaints
have been noted that the distribution of
literature in regard to peace activities
has been prevented both in Australia and
elsewhere.”
(2) On the procedural level also the
organisers maintained a strict, yet not
readily obvious, control over the type of
policies which would emanate from “dis-
cussions”. It is not an exaggeration to
state that within my Commission, every
time a speaker (i.e., about three people)
took a political line which happened to
criticise the Soviet Union, we were inter-
rupted sooner or later by the Chairman
(a prominent Victorian ALP member)
and told that our comments were either
“too particular” or “not relevant”. At
least twice the arbitrary 3-minute time
limit principle was applied just for the
benefit of these speakers. On Thursday
morning, another instance of procedural
manipulation occurred. The Conference’s
Findings Committee had collated and pre-
sented its summary of the views of the
Conference and had, in one paragraph,
singled out (note the “too particular”
ruling mentioned above) Australia, New
Guinea, USA, South Africa, South Viet-
nam, Cyprus and Malaysia as nations
which had violated the UN Declaration
of Human Rights in various (mentioned)
ways.
Foolishly endeavoring to give the para-
graph a slight balance, I moved, and
spoke upon, a motion that the Confer-
ence accept an addendum which would
include the Soviet Union on this list
because of its internal suppression of Jew-
ish minority rights. Immediately there
was an attack from all sides of the Con-
ference body on the validity of my evi-
dence and my personal sincerity. Mr
Allen (member of National, Manage-
ment and Findings Committees) (sic),
Mesdames Holmes and Morrow waxed
indignant. And then came the classic
manoeuvre. Amid the shouting and con-
fusion a fellow sped up to the micro-
phone and moved that all the references
to particular countries be deleted and
that we simply make a reference to the
duty of “all countries” to abide by the
Declaration. The Chairman then asked
for a vote on this and it was carried. Thus
the original “Jews” motion was con-
sidered irrelevant and no voting on it
necessary. It was later revealed to me by
an ex-Communist that this anxious young
man had been merrily conversing with
Mr W. Brown of the Central Committee
of the Communist Party immediately
prior to his action. This latter fact would
not have been so significant had not the
usual Chair procedure been reversed
(there were no Standing Orders) so as to
eliminate the possibility of the Con-
ference condemning the Soviet Union.
(3) For most of the 8-9 hours of
“discussion” which centred around the
topics of Human Rights (Monday),
International Co-operation (Tuesday)
and Disarmament (Wednesday), how-
ever, it was hardly necessary for the Con-
ference “heavies” to clamp down. The
solid body of pro-Communist opinion
itself ensured that the correct “line”
would dominate the Conference. It had
an unbreakable power of veto. Speaker
after speaker arose to condemn West-
ern interference in Asian affairs, the state
of human rights in Australia, Malaysia
and South Vietnam, US imperialism and
British colonialism. Speaker after speaker
arose to declare that the profit system
was the cause of all wars, that the USSR
had been frustrated by the warmonger-

in favor of discussing the problem of

of jargon gets nowhere.
Again, despite the efforts of the Chair-
men to emphasise that a “democratic”
variety of opinion had been expressed on
all issues, only two “sets” of opinion
challenged the prevailing ideas: (i) the
Peking-line Communists (very few), led
by Party member Mrs Betty Little, who
supported China’s bomb and declared the

"Coal Flat”
SIR.—I regret that a clumsy and ambigu-
ous sentence in my article on the arts
in New Zealand (“The Barbarian Revo-
lution” 10/10/64) allowed your corres-
pondent Barry Thorpe to misconstrue an
observation about Bill Pearson’s “Coal
Flat” which was unnamed in the
article. I said I had yet to meet a person,
not a friend of the author, who had read
the book. What I meant was that I had
yet to meet a person, not a friend of the
author, who had managed to finish read-
ing the book.
Like all defenders of “Coal Flat”, how-
ever, Mr Thorpe resorts to character
assassination. Professional animosity un-
leashed in my article? God help me, I
have animosities enough without profes-
sional animosities too: I haven't the time
to spare for them. (And besides, I hap-
pen, on the strength of a couple of meet-
ings, to like Mr Pearson as a person.) Mr
Thorpe has a great deal in common with
New Zealand’s literary-academic Mafia:
he finds it impossible to concede anyone
else a sincerely-held opinion.
MAURICE SHADBOLT

League of Rights
SIR. —The letters by Messrs Butler,
Banks and Killen share an unmistakable
unity of approach based on sophistry
and evasion. Following World War II
and public disclosures of the Nazi geno-
cidal death factories, Mr Butler pro-
duced a book based on the infamous
forgery “The Protocols of the Elders of
Zion”. He could have repudiated this
book. He has not done so. Of late Mr
Butler has been quoting glowingly a
group calling itself the “American Coun-
cil for Judiasm”. This bogus group has
been condemned by all legitimate Ameri-
can Jewish bodies because of its apologies
for Soviet anti-Semitism and fanatical
hatred against Israel.
It is the height of cynicism for a man
holding views not substantially differing
from Nazism, to deny that he is anti-
Semitic and pose as a Christian patriot.
Mr Norman Banks declined all chal-
lenges to publicly debate his views. In-
stead he invited me “to get together”
with Mr Butler. I declined because 20
years after Auschwitz, I do not feel in-
dined to share a platform with Mr
Butler.
Mr Banks presumably relied on
‘‘scientific” League of Rights racial
tracts when he made the absurd sug-
gestion that Israel practises similar
racial policies to South Africa. Mr
Banks was obviously unaware that the
Jewish people cannot scientifically be
classed as a race, despite Nazi racial
doctrine to the contrary. He is also
apparently ignorant of the Israeli Gov-
ernment's consistent record of support-
ing United Nations’ resolutions con-
demning South African racial policies.
Mr Killen still evades the only im-
portant issue under consideration
namely his close identification with the
League of Rights. I have informed the
Editor of The Bulletin of the identity
of the “intermediary” Mr Killen has the
effrontery to suggest never existed.

The Women’s Picture Business
by BEVERLEY TIVEY
The Chalk Garden. Director, Ronald
Neame. State Theatre. Sydney.
Of Human Bondage. Directors. Kenneth
Hughes and Henry Hathaway. Liberty
Theatre. Sydney.
Since show business is business, the pub-
lic must be persuaded to pay for the
show. The showman can bring this about
in two ways — by giving the public what
they want, or by making them want what
he gives them.
Neither is as easy as it sounds, but
there are a few clever, fortunate people
who have hit on the secret. Producer
Ross Hunter is the archetype of the show-
man who gives the public what they want.
His films, “Imitation of Life” and “Back
Street” notable among them for opulence
and fatuity, hark back to the lavish,
glossy, careless days of Hollywood in
the late ’30s, and are fre-
quently remakes of the more
extravagant tearjerkers of the
period. Who cares about the
war, the hydrogen bomb,
racial segregation? Let’s see
pictures about people who are
handsome, young (even when
they have adolescent children)
and well-to-do with stately
homes, who can not only afford the
servants to run them, but actually get
them, too.
Of course they do have troubles —
otherwise there wouldn't be any picture
• — but they never involve any of the
embarrassing issues, and at the end it
all turns out nice again.
These are generally described as
“women's pictures” — rather unfairly
I’ve always thought, since men generally
seem far more romantic and sentimental
than we are. The accepted explanation
of their success is that they give people
characters they can “identify with”. This
doesn't mean that you can understand
and share their feelings. These films don't
hold up a mirror to the truth, but pre-
sent a highly colored fantasy of the per-
son you wish you were — beautiful, well-
dressed, bravely enduring those troubles
that you just know will come right in the
end.
It’s hard to see what persuaded Ross
Hunter to produce a film version of Enid
Bagnold’s play “The Chalk Garden”.
Without being a dramatic masterpiece, it
is a serious and unsentimental play, rely-
ing for its theatrical effect on its literate
and often witty dialogue. Its theme is
the battle between an old woman who,
from selfish love, is driving her grand-
daughter into a fantasy world and the
governess who sees in the child the in-
security that once ruined her own life
and condemned her to years of prison.
A lonely, domineering old woman, a
neurotic child, a governess with a dark
past — who are we to identify with here?
Undaunted, producer Hunter
and his capable, subservient
director Ronald Neame have
prettied it all up to order;
everyone is terribly elegant
and the governess is the dres-
siest gaolbird you ever saw;
even the oh-so-symbolic bar-
ren garden is lush and green,
except for some obvious after-
thoughts of dead plants.
But the best moments of the film are
original Bagnold, whose forthright voice
is occasionally heard through the
Technicolor mists. There are fine per-
formances from Deborah Kerr and from
Edith Evans, brilliantly repeating the
little that's left of her original stage role.
Unfortunately both these parts have
been cut down to put the emphasis on
the character of the grand-daughter,
played exuberantly but without much
finesse by Hayley Mills. Clever as she
is, she can’t disguise the fact that she is
a picture of physical and mental health,
and seems merely badly-behaved instead
of psychologically adrift. I couldn’t help
feling that an old-fashioned spanking
was really all that was needed to make
her mind her manners.
Every few years someone seems to
be seized by an irresistible urge to re-
make Maugham’s “Of Human Bond-
age”. It would be cheaper and probably
more satisfactory to revive the old
Howard-Davis version. The latest is a
solemn, well-meaning affair suffering
from a change of directors in midstream
and a gross piece of miscasting in Laur-
ence Harvey, whose appearance of cal-
culating selfishness makes him thorough-
ly unconvincing as the club-footed
student victimised by his obsessive love
for a cheap waitress.
Kim Novak’s Cockney accent is uneasy,
but she is acceptable in her (or the dir-
ectors’) interpretation, which softens
Maugham’s (and Bette Davis’) reading
of the character, who is not simply a
foolish, pleasure-loving featherbrain but
a cold-hearted woman who uses her only
talent, sexual attraction, not for pleasure
but as a weapon.
Even the pedestrian treatment can’t
quite cancel out the plot’s inherent in-
terest. The painstaking Edwardianism of
the art direction has to battle against
some horrid anachronisms in the script
— people talk of making a date and a
country-bred girl talks glibly of guilt
complexes, though the doctors in the
film still refer to “those new-fangled
psychologists.”

Sibley’s Distortions
Andrew Sibley. Rudy Komon Gallery.
Society of Artists. Department of Education
Art Gallery.
Gothic Art. Art Gallery of NSW.
Following Andrew Sibley’s work through
various one-man shows poses as many
queries as it answers. He has not settled
down to the rut of one line of inspired
images. He is interested in the figure
as a mode of comment, but I suspect
he sees humanity rather coldly as a col-
lection of newts or jelly blubbers,
whose protest is mute and wavering. He
has dabbled with French recipes but in
spirit is more attuned to the expression-
ists. Occasionally he turns up a painterly
phrase reminiscent of Soutine, but the
realisation is not carried anything like
as far.
Distortion, involving cartoon-like
form, has to rest in some powerful con-
viction. In Sibley this has not yet hap-
pened, but there is no saying that it
won’t. His line wobbles enough to turn
figures into spineless wriggles. He ad-
mires Fairweather and Whiteley and
could learn considerably from their
example, since his own interests lie
along similar directions.
This show reveals him in transition
from a past achievement to the undis-
closed perils of a new.
Points of view are as numerous as
the names in the catalogue at the latest
Society of Artists’ show. Lloyd Rees,
among the older members, exhibits a
fine sea piece, full of elemental energy.
Other realists, David Strachan, with one
of his most successful flower pieces, and
William Salmon in his bush paintings,

jects. John Coburn in a style reminis-

Practically every museum has stored
in its cellars enough works to mount
dozens of minor shows. The objects in
this Gothic exhibition from the Victoria

have been found in any parish church
or monastery in the Western world. A
late Italian Madonna, a taut polychrome
Virgin from 13th- 15th Century Spain, a
limewood Bishop from Germany, have
effortless rhythm, pathos and sweetness.
We might not be able to imagine the
tvast complexities of a great cathedral,
but here we are treated to the ex-
quisiteness of the infinitely small. The
minor crafts are raised to the level of
major, and of course liturgical vessels,
monstrances, enamels, crosses or reli-
quaries were treated as such. Paradoxi-
cally. in looking around the ivories,
coffers, caskets, brass rubbings and
plaques from England. France, Ger-

(workmanship seem far too high to make
much impression on contemporary taste.

MUSIC
Obscurity
ISCM Concert. Cell Block Theatre. Sydney.
Since his demonstration in London this
year of his remarkable abilities as a
conductor, it is no longer possible to
dismiss Pierre Boulez as a composer
whose work need not be taken seriously.
But his music still presents severe dif-
ficulties for both performer and listener.
Deeply involved with the problem of de-
veloping a contemporary musical idiom,
he has made no concession to public
taste. Starting from twelve-note tech-
nique (he later wrote: “Any composer
who has not felt the necessity of twelve-
note language is superfluous”), Boulez
developed through an experimental
phase of total serialisation to a music
that makes increasing use of notions
that, in his words, are “variable in their
very formulation and are functions of
ever-evolving hierarchies.”
This mature style is exemplified in his
third piano sonata, a movement of
which was performed in Sydney recently.

The style is superbly improvisatory, and
in this was well adapted to the
possibilities of the instrument. The piano
writing, in fact, sounded like Liszt’s in
its exploitation of keyboard technique,
though unlike Liszt’s, it never attempted
to produce anything other than a piano
sound.
At a first hearing, the logic of the
movement remained obscure. No fur-
ther light was shed on it by a repeat
performance, as the movement is one
in which the performer is given freedom
in the choice and ordering of the sec-
tions of the piece, and the two versions
played were quite dissimilar. But the
performance left no doubt of the bril-
liance of Boulez’ aural imagination or
of the strength and suppleness of his
style. Much more of his music should
be performed here.

Those jazzmen who emerged during the
’twenties and survived the ’thirties were
ruggedly individualistic and their playing
bore the characteristics of their personal-
ities. Inevitably, the time is not far off
when they will all be gone: Jack Tea-
garden, who personified this breed, died
early this year, aged 58, and seven others
who appear with him on “The Golden
Horn of Jack Teagarden” have also pass-
ed on. Heart-warming albums like this—
which features the great trombonist with
six different groups and spans a period
of twenty-five years help to preserve
their memory.
In 1927, Jack Teagarden arrived in
New York from Texas and astounded
the natives with a fully developed jazz
style, a revolutionary style for the time
which was never to alter appreciably and
which was to play a large part in res-
cuing the trombone from the clownish,
hole-plugging role it had played until
then. He also displayed a talent for sing-
ing the blues in a lazy, amiable baritone.
From a 1929 version of “Basin Street
Blues” with a Red Nichols group to a
sensitive “Body and Soul” recorded in
1953, the album is loaded with out-
standing jazz samples which, although
Teagarden himself was never style-
bound, are predominantly Dixieland in
flavor. Particularly pleasing is the in-
clusion of four tracks from a memor-
able 1931 session by an Eddie Lang-
Joe Venuti pick-up band which includ-
ed Benny Goodman, Jack’s brother
Charlie on trumpet, and Ray Bauduc
on drums. Each musician plays at the
top of his form on “Someday Sweet-
heart”, “Beale Street Blues”, “After
You’ve Gone” and “Farewell Blues” and
a unique sound is given to the en-
semble by the guitar and violin of the
joint leaders.
Typically vigorous are three tunes Tea-
garden recorded with Eddie Condon in
the company of such dedicated jazzmen
as Max Kaminsky, Wild Bill Davidson,
Pee Wee Russell and George Wettling.
Two numbers from a 1934 session under
Adrian Rollini's leadership illustrate the
trend away from the prevailing Dixie-
land and contain brilliant solos by Good-
man and Teagarden. One representative
track from the Armstrong All Stars, made
during Teagarden’s four-year stay with
that group, is a testimonial to the artistic
relationship that existed between these
two masters.
Full, accurate information on all ses-
sions and intelligent notes by Stanley
Dance round off an extremely rewarding
album.
If Jack Teagarden was a paragon of
the jazz virtues, the name Lawrence VVelk
has become a synonym for corn amongst
musicians, and doubtless this is the rea-
son why Welk is, reputedly, the highest-
paid band-leader in America while Tea-
garden died in comparatively poor cir-
cumstances. Welk’s orchestra performs
mainly for the socialites at those posh
functions where anything more alive
might intrude. Judging by “Lawrence
Welk Plays the Hits”, this is the recipe
for success: take a fashionable tune, over-
orchestrate it (using as many electronic
devices as are available), add treacle and
gimmicks to taste and stir well until
the whole has the consistency of clam
chowder, further sweeten with strings
and serve a la Liberace.
Besides being in questionable taste, it
has always seemed to me the height of
absurdity for a grown man, with face
blacked, to go down on his knees before
an audience shouting, through a mouth-
ful of molasses, such gross banalities as
“Mammy! Mammy! Look at me! I'm
yo’ li'l baby”. Nevertheless, A1 Jolson’s
fans are established and unshakeable and
they, if nobody else, will enjoy the nos-
talgic selection of his songs presented on
“For Me and My Gals”.

The Smugness of Lewis Eliot
By R. G. GEERING
Corridors Of Power. C. P. Snow. Mac-
millan. 31s. 6d.
“I’m in trouble, Lewis,” said Jack
Cotery 24 years ago on the first page of
“Strangers and Brothers”. This well-
known sequence now numbers nine
novels with the publication of “Corri-
dors Of Power”, and is nearing the end
of its run. Since that first volume we
have grown accustomed to Lewis Eliot
in his twofold role as the knowledge-
able, sympathetic narrator, a kind of
father-confessor to whom the disturbed
(and the not-so-disturbed) in book after
book go for advice; and as a participant,
to some degree, in the action itself.
Lewis is as übiquitous as ever in this
latest volume; the country mansions of
Conservative supporters, the rooms of
high officials in two (conveniently)
interlocking Defence departments, the
private residences of Tory MPs and
Civil Service heads, gatherings for mil-
lionaire industrialists, seedy pubs and
respectable clubs, the Commons, and
the dingy corridors of Whitehall in
any of these places matters of great
moment, national and personal, might
need Lewis’s attention.
Roger Quaife, the most talented of
the younger Tories, seeking Lewis’s help
on a political issue, says:
“I believe you want some of the
things I do. The trouble with you,
you like to sit above the battle. I don’t
know that I’ve got much use for that.
You’re prepared to get your hands a
bit dirty. I’m not sure that that’s as
creditable as you would like to think.
I must say, I sometimes lose my
respect for people who know as much
as you do, and still don’t come and
fight it out.”
If we except what Snow has called the
novels of “direct experience”, “Time Of
Hope” and “Homecomings”, in which
Lewis is the central figure, “Corridors
Of Power” comes perhaps closest of all
the novels of “observed experience” to
effecting a deeper involvement of the nar-
rator. At the end of this story, which
concerns Quaife’s attempts as a Defence
minister to ease Britain out of the
nuclear arms race altogether, thereby
giving a lead to other nations outside
the main power blocs, and his ultimate
failure to win sufficient parliamentary
support, Lewis, who has backed Quaife,
feels compelled to resign from the Civil
Service. Even his inclusion in the
Honors List will not dissuade him. With
that smugness that does more than any-
thing else to disqualify him as the nar-
rator for such a vast sweep of events
as Snow encompasses in this series of
novels, he accepts the flattery of his
boss, Sir Horace Rose (“He was speak-
ing with fairness, and perhaps with
justice”) and, persuaded that he is, for
the present at least, indispensable, agrees
to defer his resignation. The final
chapter is set some months later, with
Quaife about to disappear from the
political scene and Lewis, presumably, out
of a job. For his later career we shall
have to wait for the concluding volumes.
“Corridors Of Power” will not alter
the views Snow’s supporters and detract-
ors already hold. Time will prove, I
believe, that the elaborate “Strangers
and Brothers” edifice is most certainly
not (as some critics have argued) one of
the great fictional achievements of the
twentieth century. On the other hand,
Snow is just as certainly not the nin-
compoop that Dr Leavis
in his deplorably venomous
attack a couple of years ago
made him out to be. This
book demonstrates, as well
as any of the others in the
series, why it is that Snow’s
achievement falls between
these two extremes.
In its rather obvious and
ponderous way ‘Corridors
Of Power” does bring us
up against the question of
power in the contemporary
world and does demonstrate
certain of the dilemmas of
political life. The observations are true
as far as they go, sometimes (as in
Lewis’s remarks on the cynicism of the
unworldly) very perceptive, but the
analysis of power itself, ostensibly
Snow’s central concern, is never really
pursued to the reader’s satisfaction. Snow
always seems to be over-impressed by
the status of those who hold power and
it is this perhaps that prevents a
thorough-going analysis. He can be most
convincing on processes. By showing how
important political decisions may hang
by the slenderest of threads, he can de-
monstrate the interaction of public and
private life. There is no doubt as to
the reality of the problems Snow poses,
and the attempts that his opponents
sometimes make to play these problems
down deserve the counter-charges of
egocentricity and shortsightedness. We
are given some insight into what goes
on behind the scenes where the big
decisions are taken. Furthermore the
public figures sit readily enough as types
within the social framework Snow con-
structs. But, with few exceptions in his
work as a whole (and none in “Corridors
Of Power”), these people display none
of the richness of the inner life, whose
revelation is one mark of great fiction.
Quaife is the one who calls for treat-
ment in depth here, but Snow seems so
fascinated with the rise and fall of his
political fortunes, with the number of
votes that he will be able to muster at
the final count, that he has no time (or
inclination?) for a full and satisfying
study of what is potentially an interest-
ing character.
Sir Charles once told the world that
his view of Realpolitik is not meant as
satire; for him satire is cheek it is
“the revenge of those who cannot really
comprehend the world or cope with it”.
The pseudo-profundity of such a view
is terrifying. “Corridors Of Power”
would be all the better tor a bit of cheek
at the expense of the bureaucrats and
the specialists (self-styled and genuine).
After a few chapters one begins to long
for something shocking an outburst of
obscenity from a departmental head at
a committee meeting, or the like. The
unexpected might give a lift to the prose
as well; to judge from the
following it needs it:
“. . . he had just been
turned down for the sixth
time, he announced at the
top of his voice, his laugh
ringing out like a spirited
but inappropriate imitation
of Roland's horn at Ronces-
valles. Caro went by at
that moment, magnificently
pretty, looking as though
she were carefree.”
A mistrust of satire and
a lack of humor might
well be taken as limitations
in a novelist who has spread his net as
widely as Snow. One can't help feeling
that in his attempts to be serious he some-
times ends up being merely solemn.

like the biography to end all biographies

known by her former title of Lady

a skilled biographer, with no inhibitions
about the need to reveal the frailties
of Royalty, or their private views,

passionate research and with a tendency

I enclose in payment
to throw doubt on her viewpoint or con-
clusions.
One instance of this sort is her rather
astounding version of the marital life of
the Duke of Kent before he entered
for the Royal marriage race in which
his only winnings consisted of Victoria.
The Duke, whose military and orga-
nising virtues and abilities set him far
apart from and above his brothers, she
seems thoroughly to underestimate. She
sets out the details of his desertion of
Julie de St Laurent, in order to produce
an heir acceptable for the British Throne,
accurately enough. But her version of
the St Laurent romance and its fruits is
sadly deficient.
She writes that “all we know for
certain is that a Mademoiselle (not
Madame) de St Laurent was shipped by
Prince Edward (Kent) from Marseilles
to Malaga in 1790” and that her liaison
with him was a “sedate partnership
resembling marriage, of nearly 28 years’
duration”. She dismisses as “legends”
the assertions that Edward actually made
her his morganatic wife though there is
strong evidence in favor of that; that
she was married when he shipped her
to Malaga and that the husband con-
veniently disappeared; that Julie bore
him a son or sons who were adopted
by others at birth; and that Queen Vic-
toria had Julie's marriage lines stolen
from Quebec by two masked men.
(Actually they are supposed to have dis-
appeared in the Martinique earthquake.)
To which is added that “if the Duke of
Kent did have any children by his
acknowledged partner ... it is hard to
see why he should have wanted to con-
ceal them; this was not the practice of
his brothers. It is more likely, in fact,
that the Duke of Kent’s illegitimate
children —assuming he had some—were
the result of other youthful liaisons”.
Actually, he seems not to have concealed
them. The matter is very much of in-
terest to Australian biography. At St
James’s it was a pretence for many years
that Julie never existed. But the work
of Hector Bolitho and others seems to
have established a well-linked story of
her birth as a member of the French
“sugar nobility”; her marriage to Baron
de Fortisson, her retirement to a con-
vent after her desertion; her elevation to
the French peerage by Charles X, her
retirement to Quebec, her re-marriage
to Prince Colonna (a Russian of an old
Italian line), and her old age which ended
in 1872 when she was 106 years old.
It seems indisputable that she left two
sons by Edward, one of them named
Robert Wood, who took the name of his
foster father and who remained in
Canada and founded a militr ry dynasty
through a marriage with the daughter
of a naval employee, Charlotte Gray.
The other came to Australia and
founded the well known De Mestre
family. Prosper De Mestre arrived here
in 1818 as an American citizen. He
showed a remarkable facility for win-
ning with Government or Court assist-
ance in any commercial or legal diffi-
culty. He became a pioneer of the
Consular Corps, was naturalised in the
1820 s and his son is best known to most
Australians as owner of the winners of
three Melbourne Cups, the first in 1861.
His horse, Archer, the second time won
with the weight of lOst 21b up—a record
save for Carbine's lOst 51b. His third
win was with Tim Whiffler in 1867.
Anybody who has seen portraits of the
Duke of Kent and Julie St Laurent
would have little doubt about the rela-
tionship of descendants to the romantic
pair. The Georges were certainly what
is called in cattle breeding “prepotent”
and placed their stamp on future genera-
tions clearly. When consorting with
another reputed descendant of a mon-
arch in Sydney one is apt to have the
pleasant illusion of tippling with William
the Fourth.
Lady Longford’s book is an important
addition to Victoriana, a magnificent
source book for historians and play-
wrights whether her facts are always what
they should be or not. She presents to
view the fantastic, tough little figure of
a Queen who could think Gladstone a
“humbug” and tell him to his face that
he was only a “temporary premier”
while she was the “permanent” one. She
emerges in the book living, forthright
and ready to pit her will against any-
body and everybody, her story docu-
mented with a full conspectus of all her
loves and hates as she jousted with life
and strove to take the wind out of the
sails of the “abominable old G Man”,
as she called the hero of nineteenth-
century liberalism.

One-Armed Violinist
Salinger: a critical and personal portrait.
H. A. Grunwald (ed.). Peter Owen. 30s.
Mary McCarthy has called the sustain-
ed lyric monologue of “The Catcher in
the Rye” a triumph of literary ventrilo-
quism . . . “that compels admiration
more as a feat than as a novel, like the
performance of a one-armed violinist.”
Such a performance is apt to perplex
people, to worry them because it can-
not be explained away. And indeed,
Salinger’s critics are a bothered lot. He
has brought a volume of critical reaction
totally disproportionate to his small out-
put of twenty-nine stories and one story
that grew into a novel. There is obvious-
ly something irritating, something
elusive about Salinger and his creations,
the Caulfields and the Glasses, that has
prompted the most prominent literary
critics in America to seek an explan-
ation of him, and them, as much to
satisfy themselves as to pass a public
judgment.

NZL4S/8.3C.
In each of the twenty-six essays in
|is collection, there is an almost des-
jerate attempt to classify Salinger, but
as the editor, H. A. Grunwald, remarks
in his introduction, he will not stay
/classified. And there is something very
personal about Salinger criticism that
reflects on just this fact. Critics are
seemingly put out by their inability to
simply dismiss him or glorify him, so
lhat much of their writing is bad-
ftempered and frustrated. Ironically too,
She brings out in those who upbraid him
for cuteness and clubbishness, just the
same tendency to cuteness and verbal
and intellectual cunning, almost as
though they’re out to show him a thing
or two themselves, just so he doesn’t
think he’s fooling them.
. Because of this subjective reaction
to Salinger, and to Holden Caulfield
and Seymour Glass themselves, there
seem to me to be several consistent
fallacies running through this whole
collection. First, the contributors criti-
cise Salinger for not doing what he
./never set out to do, so that he is accused
lof failing to achieve what was never
Ms object. Secondly, they attack him
and his morality through his characters:
they assume he is his characters, par-
ticularly Buddy Glass in “Seymour: An
Introduction” (which seems to me just
,as much Buddy: An Overt Projection).
And thirdly, they concede Salinger ex-
pertness, efficiency, perception, crafts-
manship, and profundity, but level
ithese as charges against him, rather than
compliment him for them, as though
jthey are but superficial glitter to conceal
a lack of whatever they feel he should
offer. This, incidentally, seems tied up
with an unexplained universal grudge
'against the “New Yorker” magazine,
where Salinger publishes his stories.
The interpretations are as many as
the essays. They range from the socio-
logical view of David Stevenson, who
sees in “The Catcher in the Rye” a
theme of emotional estrangement in-
tended to typify contemporary Ameri-
can alienation, or Arthur Mizener who
defines his central theme as a conflict
between the emotional need to belong
and the intellectual impossibility of do-
ing so, through to the extremist religious
view of Josephine Jacobsen who con-
cludes that Salinger’s ultimate concern
is with “the human exchange of beatific
signals”. Criticism, as Donald Barr says,
falls between the Lonely Crowd and
the Beatitudes, and most of those rep-
resented here take a middle course. It
is because so many critics bring to Sal-
inger an independently-consistent theory
of his work, that in most cases he fails
to satisfy them. Their objections are
often not to the stories Salinger has
j Written, but to the stories they might
have been.

“But Not For Love” drastically and

an epic novel in which situations and
characters are presented in an exacting
detail which could be tedious were it
not so full of humor and shrewd obser-

Sam Guthrie, a self-made millionaire,
symbolises the ruthless drive for power.
He might have kept his humanity had

in a merger scheme, and determined on
success, he is inevitably tempted past the
stage of feeling guilty especially about
letting old friends down.

Texas. Jake lies, Guthrie’s old buddy
who now works as skipper of his deep-
sea fishing launch, with his rough and
ready lack of grammar, is at the mercy
of the hard-talking tycoonery and in his
resentment lords it over the “niggers”,
who in turn resent his arrogance.
It is, however, with another set of
characters that Mr Shrake really excels
with idiom and representation. These
are younger, lesser though privileged fry
who have been at school or university
together, dominated by a character called
Cadmus, whose “daddy” is in oil. Cad-
mus, an eccentric with the face of a
dissipated undergraduate, a hard head
for liquor and a grand disregard for the
rules, philosophises continually in
phonetically rendered speech, which is
a mixture of quaint Southern dialect and
Mexican Spanish. A birthday party
which begins on a Friday night in Fort
Worth and culminates in Mexico on
Sunday afternoon, is used to accentuate
the chaotic state of personalities and
values of the group. It is in this atmos-
phere that Ben Carpenter, an angry
young attorney who has been fighting
Guthrie in his merger deal, emerges. He
expresses his hatred for Guthrie and all
that he stands for in a violent confron-
tation at the Mexican bullfight which
climaxes the story.
“The Operator”, a first novel by
American Robert Rubens, is utterly
simple, just the bare bones of a situation
which involves a character called loel
Winikor.
Bored and frustrated with his family
and home town he retreats into a fan-
tasy life. It is pity that this Mitty-like
aspect of his character had not been al-
lowed to develop more fully before the
author let him escape to London. Here,
by chance, Joel lands himself in a zany
literary circle and at last accepts reality,
though of a fantastic kind. This is a
satire on London’s off-beat society in
which Joel soon proves himself to be a
sharp operator.
Without any grounds whatsoever he
establishes himself as an interviewer,
selling articles to highbrow magazines,
national newspapers even the BBC is
after him. In the woods of Chelsea and
Bloomsbury this babe from Baltimore
moves with less naivete than one would
have expected of a dreamer who couldn’t
make the grade as a derk in the public
library back home.
Joel as a character rides high above
the book’s shadowy themes. The villain
of the piece, a jealous lover who finally
topples Joel and jerks him into sane
reality, is a bit too forced to be believ-
able, even in satire.
Most of the stories of “A Walk on the
Beach” by New Zealand writer O. E.
Middleton take a serious view of life.
The title story sets a mood of introspec-
tion in which a young girl walking on
the beach wonders about a Japanese fish-
erman whose drowning off the coast has
been reported in the local newspaper.
The mysticism of strange and distant
lands is symbolised in the glass fishing
float she has picked up and which now
is displayed on the mantelpiece in the
lonely homestead. Mr Middleton has a
real feeling for his native land and can
evoke the atmosphere of beaches and
creeks, of dusty country towns and sun-
lit hillsides. His social conscience
emerges in “The Doss House and the
Duchess” when the New Zealand sea-
man stranded in Liverpool blatantly sits
while everyone else stands for the Royal
visitor, a type of defiant gesture once
popular with Left-wing socialists in New
Zealand. The book’s longest story, “Not
for a Seagull”, is a sensitive and disturb-
ing study of social life in New Zealand
as it affects the Maori and his relation-
ship with the white man. It shows that
even in a society in which Europeans
have always been moderate and com-
paratively generous in their attitude to
color, there is inevitably an invisible line
drawn between the races.
JOYCE BURNARD
Hearth and Home
You and Your Home. Steven Kalmar
Shakespeare Head Press. 30s.
The worst part about this book is its
title. Mr Kalmar is a skilled journalist
in the field of domestic architecture and
the title which sits fairly well in a daily
newspaper becomes out of character for
a book. In the latter Mr Kalmar is
writing not really about homes (which
can be in garrets, basements or even in
tents) but about houses and an occasional
flat, so that it could be sincerely wished
he had titled his book accordingly.
However, once this is passed there are
many good things in his book. The text
is not a heavy one, and is eked out by
long captions to the photographs. And
what photographs! Nearly all of them
are of high quality and quite a number
of them are reproduced in attractive
color.
A wide range of taste is catered for,
because there are Victorian houses,
Georgian houses, and contemporary
houses. The latter, quite rightly, fill the
greatest part of the book with a very
good selection of designs displayed.
Fortunately, too, Mr Kalmar gives us
many views of the interiors of the
houses. A house may be good to look
at from the outside, but unless the
quality of good design flows into the
dwelling space the true object is not
achieved.
Mr Kalmar’s analysis of this aspect
sometimes becomes cloying as for in-
stance when he tells us that an entrance
hall should say “How do you do” to a
newcomer, and go even further in gooi-
ness by saying “It was nice having you”
when he leaves.
There are several sections in the book;
one dealing with “architects and design-
ers” (which will make architects wince)
and one about gardens. The latter is
very good and Mr Kalmar’s observation
is that the house (he actually used that
word here) and the garden should com-
plement each other. Nothing could be
more true than that and the examples
given back up this thesis splendidly. The
variety of the examples show that
there is no one way to tackle the house-
garden problem, but each is formulated
by the particular conditions of the site.
It is evident, too, that many sites that
a few years ago would be considered
impossible for house development are
now exploited to get unusual and charm-
ing effects.
Another aspect considered in Mr Kal-
mar’s book is the modernising of old
houses, which is not by any means
always a good thing, but he does show
some bouses that have been very much
improved by their “face-lifts”, as he calls
them. Furniture and fittings too are
given a good deal of consideration which
should help many a puzzled house owner. '

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
More Growth But Lower Profits
Now that the share market has fallen, brokers and
investors are fossicking out what they think may
prove to be bargains. Selective buying is still the
keynote. But it is safe to say that share prices are at
much safer levels than a few months ago, even if the market
falls further.
Certainly the drift in some stocks should continue, and
the delayed results of many companies, which include the
bad news brigade, won’t help the general sentiment.
Nevertheless, the market often goes to extremes in its
swings and those companies which maintain their earnings
during the current period will receive greater attention
as time goes by.
Business is still extremely dull in the sharebrokers’
offices. So far, no one is reporting any flood of money
from Britain for portfolio investment. Also, with the
problems of selling indigenous oil in Australia at a profit-
able margin, US investors in oil exploration must be
pondering soberly on what the Australian Government is
going to do about it, particularly as oil drilling subsidies
have been withdrawn in areas where gas and oil are already
proved.
Brokers have been recommending a wide variety of
proved stocks in all industries, although pointing out in
several cases that the impact of rising costs will fall on
those manufacturers which cannot, because of import
competition and other special factors, pass on the increases
in costs. Despite this caution, engineers, home appliance
manufacturers, building material manufacturers and auto-
motive parts makers are variously recommended.
Tighter credit and the need for increased defence spend-
ing are mentioned occasionally, though no one sees any
setback to Australia’s growth potential. In fact, any
expenditure by the Federal Government on defence will
only create further inflationary pressures in the demand
for men and materials.
Against this background, some inflation is inevitable.
It is also obvious there will be greater pressures on costs,
thus placing greater emphasis on efficiency in an effort
to combat the inevitable rise in overheads.
Without passing the increased costs onto the public,
profit margins must be shaved. For this reason, greater
attention must be paid to earning rates in a tighter credit
period when companies are being forced to raise new
capital from shareholders.
Inflation Recognised
Tt is good to note that the US Administration now
recognises that inflation exists in America and that
steps will be taken to correct it. President Johnson, in
his last-minute election speeches, said that if he were
elected, he would oppose steel price increases, and would
restrain Government spending and wage demands.
Inevitably, US inflation has an effect on other nations.
Although some exporters may gain by selling commodities
at high prices to the US, it also raises the price structure
in the home market.
The Commonwealth Government of Australia is often
criticised for its actions, yet its moves in anticipating the
current inflationary trend are to its credit. The brakes
can always be released, but 1960 proved that remedial
action in curbing a boom often is too severe if the
restrictions are applied too late.
No Doors Slammed
HPhose who expected the new British Labor Government
A to rebuff the Common Market members were dis-
appointed when it was revealed that the Government was
prepared to discuss the issue. This is a wise policy if
Britain wishes to have any political influence on what goes
on in Europe.
Britain must survive by trade wherever she can. So
perhaps a bit of sympathetic fence - sitting could pay
dividends while waiting to see if the West German stand-
off on agricultural policy will eventually undermine the
unity of the Common Market.
Prime Minister Mr Wilson must display some interest
in Europe for obvious strategic reasons, yet curb many of
his ardent supporters who have been (and still are) bitter
opponents to Britain’s entry to the Common Market.
General de Gaulle, embarrassed by strikes among
France’s farm workers, has put pressure on West Germany
to accept a common cereal price by December 15; other-
wise he threatens to leave the club. The General also is
reminding the new boys in Britain that he is still in a huff
about prior dealings with the nation of shopkeepers; and
he is livid about the suggestion that the £2BO million joint
UK-France Concorde airliner project should be cancelled.
Le Grande Charles has threatened before, of course,
but France’s current urgency, as stated here before, is to
push through a uniform agricultural policy in Europe
before the Kennedy Round of tariff talks. Without a
common policy on European agriculture, it is generally
recognised that the Kennedy Round can come to nothing.
The primary producing nations of the world are unlikely
to agree to a reduction of their tariffs on the import of

manufactured goods unless they have assurances on their
markets for primary products, notably grain.
European politics aside, however, Britain’s most pressing
problem is her balance of payments gap and the pressure
on sterling. Interested parties who do not want to see a
deterioration in sterling include Common Market members
as well as the USA. It appears that Britain will need
co-operation from Europe in monetary measures to support
sterling. The question now being asked is what Harold
Wilson’s Government is prepared to give in return.
Are Commodities Vulnerable?
Australia’s export returns this financial year will be
influenced largely by the maintenance of the present
boom in commodity prices, particularly metals. The
London “Economist” believes that continued world in-
dustrial expansion and political upsets in major producing
areas have been the underlying reason for the basic strength
in commodities, but this has been exaggerated by an
element of panic in the metals markets. If demand in the
main industrial countries continues next year, no radical
downturn in commodity prices is likely.
That’s a pretty safe conclusion, so the next clue is to
discover what is likely to interrupt demand next year. If
the normal economic growth forecasts of each country are
accepted, even allowing for some slackening in the rate
of growth in some areas, the demand for foodstuffs and
raw materials, such as base metals, should be maintained
at least at current levels.
China has come back again as a buyer of wheat and
has made another large purchase from Australia. The
Soviet expects a better grain
harvest, but is still an un-
known quantity on the grain
market. The influence of these
two Communist areas on the
world commodities markets
makes a great deal of differ-
ence to commodity values, as
witness the extra rise in tin
when Russia failed to sell tin
on the world markets but
bought instead.
Forecasts for sustained
commodity values become un-
reliable, however, if sugar is
taken as an example. The
London price of sugar, at
around £stg33 a ton, has
slipped to less than a third of
the peak achieved last year.
Of greater significance is
the capacity of consuming
nations to pay for their pur-
chases. Britain, already facing
a major financial crisis, and
forced to borrow from the
IMF and other sources, expects to pay an extra £stg4sm.
this year for copper imports. Tin has gone wild, despite
US reports that stockpile releases will be greater than
scheduled. Lead, zinc, coffee, cocoa and rubber have
strengthened. There seems little doubt that the rising
standard of living in the developing countries will provide
an under-pinning for many items at least until such
time as they develop their own resources (if available).
If the capacity to pay is brought into the calculations,
it seems obvious that those countries which attempt to
cut back on imports must first cut down on non-essential
manufactured goods. The impact of this, although not felt
Australia’s Export Prices
Overall export prices for the'September quarter this year
are still ahead of the corresponding period of 1963-64, as
the above graph of the all-groups index indicates. How-
ever, prices have moved under the 1963-64 all-groups
average, chiefly owing to falls in sugar, dairy products and
wool. Metal prices remain high. Commodity prospects are
discussed in an article on this page.
immediately, must run back to the raw material suppliers
and it then becomes a question of which country can
export at the cheapest price.
Producers of metals have feared a price resistance for
some time and have made attempts to stabilise prices at I
levels which they felt would sustain an orderly demand.
Pundits claim that international political upsets have'
not caused any sustained impact on commodity prices,
but it would be begging the question if it were claimed
that no precautionary stockpiling occurred over the Viet-
nam and Malaysian situations.
If current prices are sustained, therefore, costs must be/
inflated. The big query then is if world demand is prepared}
to sustain higher prices for processed items without seeking}
substitute materials. Wage demands are adding to inflation
and each nation must ponder on who will have the next
recession, or whether they can all ride it out at inflated
levels.
Apprenticeship Sorcery i
Mo immediate diminution of the prolonged skilled labor
shortage can be expected from the latest apprenticeship
arrangements achieved by the Department of Labor and
National Service.
As far back as 1962, the Minister, Mr W. McMahon,
and many industrial experts were pinning their faith on'
to reasonable and speedy plans for adult training. These 1
have been unable to get off the ground, due principally
to stubborn and still-effective trade union reluctance.
Meanwhile, the best attainable compromise seems to be
a reduction of apprenticeship periods for the hopeful
tradesman possessing some
higher educational qualifica-
tions so that the length of
apprenticeship can be related
to the time required to learn
what has to be taught, as Mr
McMahon puts it.
The most recent extension
of this principle applies to the
metal, electrical and vehicle
industries, certainly a group
where the bridge between
registered vacancies and regis-
tered tradesmen has grown
particularly wide. The respec-
tive apprenticeship awards
have been amended to em-
brace a healthy list: fitters,
turners, patt ernmakers,
machinists, electrical fitters,
electrical mechanics, motor
mechanics, panelbeaters, wel-
ders, boilermakers, black-
smiths and sheetmetal
workers.
At best, though, it will take
the better-educated young man under 21 a minimum of
three years to reach fully-fledged tradesman status. Any
crash programme almost looks equally far away.
A few manufacturers, of varied sizes from BHP down-
wards, are struggling to recruit skilled labor overseas.
Brisbane engineer Charles Hope and Co. has just proudly l
announced an initial intake of nine Britishers They include
body builders, a sheetmetal worker, a die setter, an auto
electrician and a toolmaker.
With similar demands existing in most developedl
countries, more self-help will be called for in Australia.

The Battle of Containment
Booming investment together with tight resources
,4 lthough Dr Coombs had many
r* - people thinking otherwise after his
call up to SRD, it looks from
the virtually unchanged terms of the
/ November Commonwealth Loan that
the monetary authorities have opted out
of interest rate changes as the next move
in their battle to contain inflationary
pressures. How long such changes can
be delayed in the interests of Treasury
loan-raising requirements is another
f matter. Evidence from the Common-
wealth Statistician last week, pointing to
a current upsurge in fixed capital
spending in the private sector, suggests
that this weapon in the armory of
monetary policy should not be allowed
to rust, even if the possibilities for its
1 effective use are now narrowing against
1 a background of rising consumer prices.
For the moment, however, the
authorities have decided to keep it in
reserve, despite a feeling in the market
that the November loan might well have
made small increases in interest rates
' on the short and medium bonds issued.
The terms of the two shorter tranches
are the same as the August issues, that
is, a medium term 4f p.c. February
1 1975 at par and a May 1967 short to
be issued at 99i p.c. to give a redemp-
tion yield of £4/9/2 p.c. Redeemable
in October 1984, as against May the
same year, the long-term tranche other-
wise has the same terms as the August
loan, 5 p.c. issued at par.
From the Treasury’s loan-raising
viewpoint there is certainly a lot to be
said for keeping official interest rates
steady at this juncture. It still has a long
climb to reach its £275 million target
for the year. Although it clawed in £7l
million in its first loan in August, the
£2l million oversubscription to that
loan could still prove to be deceptive
of the market’s likely strength for the
rest of the year. An indeterminate, but
still significant, part of the August sub-
\ scription derived from amounts held
back from the undersubscribed May
loan, in the expectation that interest
rates would be higher in the August loan
(as they were).
VTow there is the complicating factor of
1 rising consumer prices to lessen the
attraction of Government and other
fixed-interest securities. As this is the
flush season for liquidity, and even with
the latest SRD call-up the trading banks
still have a considerable cushion from
Which to support the current loan, it
may seem a bit cautious to be going for
£lO million less in the loan than in the
corresponding one last year. On the
other hand, the authorities obviously
don’t relish the possibility of an under-
subscription, and have probably chosen
wisely in asking for only £6O million as
against £7O million, especially as no
conversion is involved. An oversub-
scription would have a tonic effect.
When this loan is out of the way
only a short interval can be expected
before another SRD call-up as part of
the tightening-up process, through which
DR H. C. COOMBS
it is generally believed short-term inter-
est rates will harden in the next few
months. How far the authorities will go
in inducing higher rates through open-
market dealings is indeterminate. In any
case, these are most likely to be con-
fined to the shorter end of the spectrum
and long term bond yields should re-
main steady at around 5 p.c.
As in August, if in the interests of
containment of inflationary pressures it
was decided to lift long-term bond rate
in February, open-market selling of the
longs would be delayed as long as
possible up to the new loan. However,
in this interval a new round of the tug-
of-war between the Treasury and the
Reserve Bank could be joined, because
Dr Coombs now has on his desk fresh
evidence of booming investment in-
deed, much stronger evidence from the
same front which alarmed him suf-
ficiently to step into the market to raise
bond yields in April and May last. The
order of events then, it will be recalled,
was to operate at the short end first and
after a few weeks to start heavy selling
of the longs.
Tn retrospect, Dr Coombs may possibly
regard his actions in those two
months, in so far as they were prompt-
ed by investment fears, as being a little
hasty, since the statistician now reveals
that the reality of fixed investment in
the January to June period fell very
far short of what the Commonwealth
Statistician anticipated. In the field (77
p.c.) covered by the statistician’s sur-
vey of the nation’s private businesses,
total capital expenditure in the period
was only £5.4 million more (£288.6
million) than in the previous half year.
Total anticipated expenditure fore-
shadowed a rise of 8 p.c. It actually
rose by only 2 p.c.
Indeed, in the segment of new build-
ings and structures, new capital expendi-
ture actually fell by 9 p.c., whereas a
rise of 15 p.c. had been anticipated.
Against this, capital expenditure on
other new plant and equipment rose by
8 p.c., more than double the percentage
rise anticipated. Obviously, very little
reliance can be placed on the figures
for anticipated expenditure and there is
a good case for ceasing to issue them.
Looking back over the last five years,
only in one half year did the actual
exactly measure up to the anticipated
figure that is, in January to June,
1962, when expenditure dropped by 5
p.c. As The Bulletin pointed out at
the time, the fixed investment statistics
available when Dr Coombs moved into
the bond market last April were some-
what confusing. He seemed to have
more up-to-date figures than the public.
The question is what will he make
of the “anticipated” figures published
last week, which show that new capital
expenditure is expected to rise by 21
p.c. this half - year over the actual
for January to June, that is, from
£288.6 million to £349.5 million? The
latter is equivalent to an annual rate of
just on £7OO million, compared with
the previous record of £571.8 million
actual established for 1963-64, and £493
million actual in the boom year 1960-
61.
The most remarkable turnabout last
half-year was in expenditure on new
buildings and structures. Yet this half-
year, a rise of no less than 26 p.c. is
anticipated in new buildings and struc-

tures. Could it be, then, that expendi-
ture in this field is really starting to
boom on a scale the authorities thought
would have been reached much earlier?
The biggest increase in any July-Decem-
ber period in the last five years was an
actual 21 p.c. rise in July-December last
year, when the economy was not as
strained as it is now.
Expenditure on other capital equip-
ment is estimated to rise by 19 p.c. this
half year. This is the biggest anticipated
increase in the last five years, in which
the next highest was 9 p.c. anticipated
for July-December, 1962. However,
there was an actual rise of 10 p.c. for
July-December, 1960, when the last
boom was at its peak. With internal re-
sources equally as tight today, it is clear
that if the anticipated rise of 19 p.c. is
achieved the strain could become intol-
erable. On the other hand, more of the
strain of new capital expenditure on
other plant and equipment can be taken
by imports in the current situation than
in 1960, when the balance of payments
was far less secure.
One of the wonders of the current
period of full employment is that, thus
far, income generation from a record
flow of new investment has been effec-
tively cushioned by an ample stream of
goods, and that so much of it has found
its way into savings rather than spend-
ing channels. The evidence of this was
examined in last week’s Croesus. Fur-
ther confirmation is seen in the Sep-
tember retail trade figures issued since,
These show sales rose by only 4i p.c.
over the previous September’s on a
daily basis, a slight drop in the rate of
increase compared with August, also on
a daily basis.
True to his calling as an economist,
there can be no doubt that Dr Coombs
will be looking at the latest evidence of
booming investment in the current tight
resources situation, with his heart in his
mouth. Like everybody else he will be
hoping that this time the statistician’s
survey of anticipated new capital ex-
penditure by private businesses is as
wildly inaccurate as it has so often
been in the past. However, with clear
signs that prices are now rising (there
were no such signs when he last took
fright from figures of buoyant invest-
ment in April), it must be presumed
that for him mere hope will not be
enough.

What’s Sauce for the Goose...
Cox Brothers and close friends
rpHE likes of Messrs Stanley Korman,
Rex Testro and James O’Grady must
be marvelling at the survival qualities of
Sir Frank Richardson this week. Their
over-borrowed empires went down the
drain without lament and few friends
spared them much thought when they
were near the brink. With Sir Frank it
is quite different. His Cox Brothers
..,» , , ,
group, which at one time last year had
113 stores doing business in all States
except Queensland, has long been held
up by powerful friends. After another
year when it notched up losses running
into millions, they were still there
battling for him harder than ever,
It can be understood why his latest
dismal results got the biggest whitewash
to splashed by certain newspapers in
years, why they put on their rose-
colored glasses to see hope in his re-

him up Jt is a little more d ifficult-and
Messrs Korman and O’Grady will
appreciate the point—to divine why the
trustees for the group’s debenture
holders are going in to bat for him, too.
The Union-Fidelity Trustee Co. has
decided not to take action against the
group, although, in its own opinion, the
debenture-holders’ trust deed has been
technically breached in the 1964 balance
sheet, yet to be released. The deed pro-
vides that aggregate liabilities shall not

exceed three times shareholders’ funds.
The fact that debentures remain well
covered by tangible assets and that the
Cox board has kept in close contact with
the trustee has undoubtedly gone a long
way in helping Union-Fidelity to over-
look the violation.
Cox Bros is convinced, and the trustees
have gone along with the idea, that the
apparent breach is only a temporary
state of affairs which is being put right
by the group’s reorganisation scheme.
Briefly, this scheme involves selling off
the deadwood, using the cash to
liquidate debts and to reduce the crip-
pling interest bill to more tolerable pro-
portions. The axe has already been used
to some effect. Last year, 23 retail out-
lets were closed or sold. By October, 19
more had gone, reducing the number to

71. Even with the proceeds of realisa-
tions of assets, funds in sight would fall
short of the sums required to pay off the
£Bi million worth of debentures and
unsecured deposits maturing in 1964-65.
This is where Sir Frank’s close friends
come in. “Do you know what it’s like
1 to have a very close friend,” he told
The Bulletin asking what role Sir
lan Potter was playing in the affair. Of
course, a subsidiary of Sir lan’s Aus-
j tralian United Corporation owns half of
the ordinary capital of Cox Finance Cor-
poration (Cox Bros owns the other half
plus all the preference shares).
Friends aside, Sir Frank’s long ex-
planation to shareholders of the group’s
financial predicament and plans to meet it
fell down on several points. For one
thing, he did not indicate what the
1963-64 loss would have been if the ac-
counts had been presented in the same
form as in the previous year. Again, even
in confidence after the formal Press con-
ference, he declined to hazard a guess
as to when reasonable profitability would
return or, what earnings and dividends
could be. His wariness on these counts
was in marked contrast to the confidence
displayed by Sir Frank and his experts
at the Press conference itself.
VI/ithout any really comparable figures
” for 1964, confusion seems to be
the main result of any efforts to gauge
how the company really performed. It’s
to be hoped that this was not one of
the directors’ intentions in presenting a
set of figures which gave no fair record
of the past and, in actuality, shed only
little light on the future, anyway. A re-
quest for figures which had been cal-
culated on the same basis as 1962-63
got nowhere.
However, even on the figures which
Sir Frank did provide, it is quite obvious
that considerable trading setbacks were
suffered, even allowing for the “inevi-
table dislocation of normal trading prac-
tices and policies” resulting from the
contraction programme. The year’s net
loss was £1.95 million, compared with
only £llB,OOO in 1963. These sums are
not strictly comparable, but they are
accurate enough for showing the down-
ward trend. It is hard to fathom the
accounting validity or relevance of the
directors’ decision to deduct £1.36 mil-
lion worth of capital profits from this
figure to arrive at what they call a “net
loss on the year’s activities” of some
£596,000. This figure means absolutely
nothing as far as profitability or lack
thereof is concerned.
Bold as the reorganization plans
| may be, they are little excuse for not
providing shareholders with an under-
standable resume of 1964. A company’s
accounts should be a record of the past,
: not a prediction of the future. Even in
this latter role, they fall short of the
mark. What guarantee is there that the
assets up for sale will fetch the balance
sheet prices? If they don’t, then the trqs-
tee will surely be taking a more critical
look at the breach of the deed. As it is,
Sir Frank talks about stores sold or
closed down, not just sold.
Exactly how feasible is the company’s
plan to make profits through cutting
sales back from £32 million to £2O
million? The last reasonable profit was
in 1959-60, when 14.4 p.c. was earned
on ordinary capital from sales of £26.8
million. True, most of the asset sales in-
volve loss companies, with the excep-
tion of Foys in WA. Sir Frank stated
that the 1963-64 turnover of those stores
to be retained was £21.75 million, down
from £22.16 million in 1962-63.
The return to profits will certainly be
a long tough pull. So, indeed, will be the
reorganization and the refinancing of
debt. Providing the trustee continues to
hold his fire and refinancing can be suc-
cessfully negotiated through AUC, Cox
Bros may yet pull through. But one
should not bet too heavily on it.


Too Many Home Appliances?
Increasing dependence on replacements
fairly small beginnings just after
the war, domestic refrigerator and
washing - machine manufacture has
grown into a solid partner in Australia’s
£l5O million-a-year electrical appliance
industry. While nearly every home has
a refrigerator, not all have washing
machines. So the market for new refrig-
erators relies principally on replacement,
while washing machines have both the
new and replacement market.
The table below shows production of
washing machines and refrigerators for
the last eleven years. The washing-
machine figure includes both automatic
and other types.

According to -a survey undertaken by
the “Australian Women’s Weekly”, wash-
ing machines have penetrated 75.4 p.c.
of Australian homes, while 97.4 have
refrigerators. By 1970 respective pene-
trations of 90.8 p.c. and 98.4 p.c. are
forecast, indicating the room for new
sales in washing machines.
The AWW estimates 151,000 refrig-
erators and 153,000 washing machines
have been scrapped in 1963-64. It fore-
casts that in 1970 236,000 refrigerators
and 183,000 washing machines will be
scrapped. It bases these assumptions on
a life span of about 12 years for re-
frigerators and about 11 for washing
machines.
The Australian industry is dependent
to a great extent on advances made in
the United States for the quality of its
products. An executive of one company
said that without American backing the
washing machine and refrigerator in-
dustry in Australia could not exist. “The
fellow who doesn’t have a US tie-up is
going to be left out of the game. The
Australian manufacturer cannot hope to
compete without the facilities available
in America.
“Competition in Australia is severe,
not only between manufacturers but at
the retail level. Discontent among the
retailers has caused this competition.
They pushed the manufacturers into long
discounts so they could compete with
the discounters who have less overheads.
But there is no reason for us not to want
both the retailer and discounter. They
have helped influence the consumer to
buy a new appliance when, perhaps, the
old one worked just as well.
“We are estimating the replacement
market for refrigerators this year to be
about two-thirds of total sales. But our
estimates of production are not as high
as some people put them. They feel the
total market for refrigerators this year
will be about 240,000 units, while we
feel it will be more in the region of
205-210,000. Of course we could be
wrong all we need is a good hot sum-
mer and sales will be very high.”
The industry has been accused several
times of having excess capacity. Some
manufacturers The Bulletin spoke to
agree that this is, unfortunately, the
case. “Capacity now is a lot higher than
it should be,” said one. “Some makers,
over-confident' about the future, have
large sections of plant lying idle. Big
firms carried out surveys into future de-
mand and geared themselves to meet it.
Now that the surveys have been proved
wrong they are in an embarrassing
situation.
“The only way to counter this surplus
capacity is for some makers to get out
or go into other fields. This is a bit
hard to do, as machines cannot be
altered readily to produce other goods.
The cost, too, is pretty prohibitive.”
An industry spokesman said the wash-
ing machine was generally regarded as
one of the most stable appliances in the
electrical appliance field. “When wash-
ing machines were first built in Aus-
tralia they had a lot of demand to
catch up. The demand is growing by
about 7 p.c. a year and still has a long
way to go before it catches up with
refrigerators. Washing machines are
non-seasonal, there is no fall-off in
sales, so they enjoy a fairly uniform
spread of retail distribution.
A director of one company said the
industry had no greater aid than the
retailer. “He has found no better gim-
mick to attract a hot prospect than the
offer of a high trade-in. For this reason
the retail price of appliances has become
somewhat fictitious. With the discounters
in the field now, the image of the market
price is being destroyed.
“It will continue this way until some
new format of merchandising, some new
gimmick, is devised. But when you have
the consumer completely attuned to
looking for a bargain as well as a good
product it is hardly worthwhile for the
manufacturer to change the selling meth-
od unless he wants to commit financial
hara-kiri. Trade-ins are the way of
doing business today.
“However, trade-in values are harden-
ing and there seems to be a move back
to more realistic values.”
The fire at Metiers’ Bankstown fac-
tory, which stopped production for eight
months, set the company back on its
heels but, said Mr J. B. Clarkson, manag-
ing director of the General Industries
group, of which Metters is a member,
it should be back in full production in
three or four weeks “with the most
modern plant in Australia, possibly the
world.”
“We’re getting a late start in the pro-
duction season. Usually we like to have
a new release around the July-August
period to meet the summer demand, but
we feel we’ll be able to catch up. The
new market for refrigerators will be-

come increasingly strong as more young
people get married, and the replacement
market will continue.”
Mr Clarkson said there had been a
change in the pattern of retail trading.
“In earlier times it seemed traditional
to offer the high trade-in on the more
expensive and larger capacity refrigera-
tors and the small trade-in on the small-
er capacity utility models, which in
turn would have a lower marked retail
price. Retailers now seem to have moved
to offering the large trade-ins right
through all capacities, leaving one
model at the low price end of the line
as what may be termed a lead-in.
“People have become used to, and
expect, big trade-ins. There is no doubt
they are impressed with the idea of
having a large discount on a large re-
tail price, which is false anyway. Manu-
facturers would naturally like to see
some means of returning to more orderly
trading but we have got used to living
with the present unsettled state of the
electrical appliance industry.”
A spokesman for Email Ltd said the
refrigerator industry had experienced
a flat spot for the last six or seven years,
while waiting for the replacement market
to make itself felt. “About ten years ago
there were three factors in favor of the
refrigerator market new homes, in-
creasing penetration into existing homes
and replacements. Now we have only
new homes and replacements. We have
been trying to get people to replace their
refrigerators more on the basis of new
designs rather than replace because the
machine is old. We think the design
features of a new machine are very im-
portant in selling it and we have induced
people to replace before breakdown.
“The best period for replacement sales
is in the next five years. For the in-
dustry, they could reach 200,000 out of
total sales of 300,000. The other 100,000
will go into new homes. Present econo-
mic conditions look like making this
forecast a reality. Demand is more than
just desire you must have purchasing
power and there is every indication there
will be this purchasing power.
“There is great potential for washing
machines. We feel the industry can pene-
trate homes at the rate of 3i p.c. more
each year. But we don’t think that every-
one buying a new home will buy a wash-
ing machine. They will certainly buy a
refrigerator because you can’t get ice
today, but washing machines are not the
only means of washing. About 50 p.c. of
new homes will buy washing machines.
“In five years’ time 80 p.c. of all
washing machines sold will be fully
automatic, as it is in America today.
There will be a hard core of people who
will buy wringer washers, but the auto-
matic will be the greatest seller.”

Reappraisal for Some
Looking at the fallen equities
llfiTH bond rate setting the pace and
requiring investors to look closely
at the higher interest rate structure,
some of the equity shares which have
fallen from higher levels now justify
some reappraisal.
In some cases, the fall has not been
a sudden or overnight occurrence. Since
1960, there have been certain groups
which have slipped back and stayed
down, suffering in many cases the
problems of feeding a high capital
structure.
★ ★ ★
T?mail, known more for its activities
as an appliance manufacturer deal-
ing in Westinghouse, Carmichael, Fyr-
side, Electrice and other electrical home
appliances, now has less than 50 p.c. of
its activities in this field. Its operations
have broadened into air conditioning,
pumps, pipes, ceramics, glass, Formica,
and Perma-Sharp stainless steel razor
blades.
The 1960 squeeze caused a shake-up
in management. At least one broker
now seems to think that the company
today is in a stronger position to earn
higher profits. Earning rate last year was
only 11 p.c. on the £5.5m. capital and
gives very little cover for the 10 p.c.
dividend. However, the enforced con-
solidation of recent years could be to
the company’s advantage.
At Bs. 7d., the yield of around 5.8 p.c.
is attractive for a patient holder.

/Contractors continue to report losses,
a factor which has been predicted
here for a long time, even before it
was noted that Perini’s were incurring
losses while becoming established in
Australia.
Hornibrook Ltd has omitted its divi-
dend after a loss of £255,750, and Keith
Morris Constructors also has warned of
a loss.
James Wallace, Thiess and McDonald
Industries have been under a cloud for
some time. The market is likely to
remain cautious until full details are
chalked up on the board.

TChe discovery of additional oil by

attention to the Federal Government’s
need to review the situation in regard to

Holders of shares in Ampol Explora-

'Phe removal of the Federal subsidy

the budgets of most oil exploration
companies, with a consequent revision

Some oil speculators in the higher

capital call-ups as an offset to tax com-
mitments, but calls also have a depress-
ing effect on the market at times and
can cause some nasty capital losses.
There are plenty of market operators,

An Unhappy Flourish
Grand plans for Anthony Hordern
Shareholders are hardly likely to leap
for joy at Anthony Hordern’s
grandiloquent plans to re-develop the
Brickfield Hill store site. A £9 million
super-colossal building to embrace lots
of office space doesn't begin to hold
Water until the trend of Sydney’s actual
development turns away from the cen-
tral and Circular Quay areas.
No doubt directors will expand upon
their first flush of enthusiasm at the
annual meeting, even going so far as to
deal with the rumors of Hong Kong
finance. Whatever happens, the hard
choices of some major reconstruction
must be faced.
Directors do, of course, deserve a
measure of sympathy in having to
wrestle with the Brickfield Hill monster
an awkward building to modernise,»
at the wrong end of the town, and so on.
Nevertheless, the projected curtailment of
retailing activity, there will have to be
accomplished with distinguished effi-
ciency for the group still to remain
viable on its present capitalisation:
The tale of recent group losses makes
melancholy reading the latest*
£96,334; 1962-63, £46,212; and £559,882
for the 18 months to August 31, 1962.
It’s little consolation that the cash posi-
tion is “satisfactory”.
Hordern’s 20s. shares haven’t seen
par for quite a while now. They reached
a best 19s. 3d. in 1963, 16s. earlier this
year, and stand at a low around 7s. 3d.
Sweet Thirteenth
T ife Savers’ shares shouldn’t even
frighten the superstitious. The com-
pany has just lifted profit for the 13th
successive year to a record £315,030,
£24,829 higher than the previous result.
The latest result remains after tax of
£219,000 (last year £183,000) and de-
preciation of £110,688 (£109,685). It
represents 32.1 p.c. on capital compared
with 1962-63’s 29.5 p.c. The 16 p.c.
dividend is confirmed with a final 8 p.c.
Directors say they expect the com-
pany to increase its share of the market
with a steady rate of growth in existing
lines and new product releases. The
company’s highly respected 5s shares
are currently selling at 335., to yield 2.4
p.c.
Cast a Close Eye
Investors who are hungry for capital
1 profits should keep a close eye on
Henry Berry. Last week’s result for
1963-64 was a real kick in the teeth for
shareholders, many of whom will no
doubt sell out. Any depression in prices
could provide real bargain buying, as
the year's setbacks appear to be only
temporary.
Earning rate on higher ordinary capital
came back from 15.5 p.c. to 5.6 p.c.,
to provide a negative cover for the steady
9 p.c. dividend. The setback was caused
by the £35,000 written off by a subsidiary
as development costs. They will not
recur this year. In the first quarter of
1964-65, in fact, turnover and profit are
“very substantially” in excess of com-
parable figures for the previous year.
It seems that directors may have been
unwise in hiding the year’s excess costs

COMPANY MEETING;
ELDER SMITH
GOLDSBROUGH MORT LIMITED
THE CHAIRMAN'S SPEECH AT ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
Highlights from the Address given by the Chairman, The Rt Hon
Sir Philip Mcßride, KCMG, to the Annual General Meeting of Share-
holders, held in Adelaide on November 3, 1964.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I do not propose to make a long
address. Your Directors consider that
their duty to you, the Shareholders, is
more adequately and appropriately dis-
charged by informing you fully as to
the Company’s affairs before the Annual
General Meeting, rather than at it. This
we have done in the Directors’ Report.
It is with pleasure, therefore, that I
am able to report today that, although
this is only the Company’s second such
meeting, our activities are now com-
pletely integrated and we have therefore
been able to report fully to you on your
affairs, both as a Company and as a
Group.
HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE
ACCOUNTS
Our turnover of £286 million was £4B
million higher than the previous year,
and higher than the aggregate of Elders
and Goldsbroughs in any previous year.
The Company’s capital of £12,000,000
remained unchanged, but Shareholders’
Funds were increased by some £3,200,000
to £31,100,000; the market value of its
investments was £1,297,000 higher than
cost, while nearly £8,000,000 has been
conserved by way of depreciation and
amortisation.
It appears to be fashionable today,
despite our pride in our “free enterprise”
economy, to criticise large profits for
their size, and without any regard to
the amount of money that shareholders
have invested in their enterprise in order
to produce that profit.
I feel it pertinent to point out that our
profit of £2,616,000 represents an earn-
ing of less than one per cent on our
£286 million turnover.
Further, although it represents a
return of some 21.8 per cent on our
£12,000,000 capital, it represents a
return of only 8.4 per cent on the funds
which shareholders own and have in-
vested in the Company.
FINANCING RURAL PROGRESS
Financial assistance to our clients has
been substantial, and Debtors increased
by some £1,800,000 to a new high of
£38,000,000.
At September 30, the 23 Pastoral
Houses of Australia (including the many
small ones) had no less than £126,200,000
invested in financial assistance to the
man-on-the-land.
As this is confined virtually to .the
sheep, cattle and pig-raising aspects of
rural production, the part that we, and
others like us, play in developing and
servicing that part of rural industry,
with which we are associated, is very
considerable indeed.
Our industry’s availability of funds is
restricted to such money as share-
holders invest or retain in their enter-
prises; interest-bearing overdraft accom-
modation available from banks; and
funds borrowed on the market at com-
petitive market rates.
Any restriction in trading bank lend-
ing is quickly reflected in increased calls
on pastoral houses for assistance. This
was evidenced in 1960, when demands
were so heavy that pastoral house rural
debtors reached the then record peak
of £119,700,000 at November 30,
having progressed from a figure of
£101.900,000 in June of that year.
One must view with considerable con-
cern the trend in our Industry’s rural
advances this year. At September 30,
they had reached a new record “high”
of £126,200,000. We now face the un-
certainty as to whether a “tight” money
policy, as in 1960, could lead to still
heavier demands on our limited resources
as they did progressively in that year.
On the available evidence, there would
seem to be little escape from the 1960
experience. Advances, as stated, are
moving significantly upwards; bank lend-
ing is being restricted; and the special
“term loan” funds in the banking system
have been fully absorbed.
As one whose roots are deep, and
interest great, in our rural industries, I
am glad that your Company has so
managed its affairs, and your resources,
that we are far better placed today to
be able to help our clients than would
have been the case had we not taken
the amalgamation steps that we did.
Your Company can be relied upon to
carry its share of the responsibility which
we recognise as our role in the rural life
of our community, to the utmost within
our available resources.
RURAL DEVELOPMENT
Rural production has expanded tre-
mendously and without creating labor
shortage problems in fact, our rural
producers have had to face a decrease
in available labor and yet effectively meet
the challenge to produce more and
export more.
It is comfortable for the nation to
view the high level of our reserve of
overseas funds, but it should also be the
case that there should be a proper under-
standing and appreciation of the fact that
we could not possibly enjoy our present
“balance of payments” position and
prosperity, were it not for the efforts
made, and exports provided, by the man-
on-the-land.
It should also be realised that, as soon
as the man-on-the-land enjoys a reason-
able return for his effort, there is an
almost immediate reflection in a further
surge of development of new areas of
hitherto unproductive land, and of in-
creased and improved pastures and crops
from already-developed land.
There should not be any restriction
on the availability of short-term and
long-term funds for those who, with
prospect of success, are prepared to
undertake the essential work of increas-
ing our potential to produce exports.
Without the income from increased ex-
ports Australian secondary and tertiary
industries could not meet the cost of the
equipment and raw materials so necessary
to them, in increasing quantities, if they,
too, are to develop and expand, and so
provide employment for our rapidly-
increasing population.
INFLATION AND INCREASING
COSTS
Our Accounts show that our costs for
the year were some £547,000 lower than
the previous year.
These figures are misleading, unless
we bear in mind that the results for 1963
included a 15-months’ period at Golds-
brough’s trading. On a strictly compar-
able basis, if it were available, we would
find that the year did not produce a
saving in costs. Savings from integration
enabled us to offset the costs naturally
associated with the increased volume of
business handled, plus the substantial
impact of the Margins Award.
Since the Margins Award, our costs,
and also those of our clients, have been
further materially affected by the con-
tentious basic wage decision.
The inflationary effect of this decision
proved to be one which neither industry
nor Governments could ignore or absorb.
In consequence, costs have clearly begun
an upward movement, more or less
“across the board”.
Government budgets (Federal and


State) have nearly all introduced in-
creased charges, which will raise costs
for us: for all branches of commerce
and industry; and finally for the man-on-
the-land, who must produce his exports
this year in the face of somewhat re-
duced prices in overseas markets.
As industry has felt the impact of
higher Government charges, increased
taxes, and the £1 per week Basic Wage
decision (following so closely on the
Margins Award), prices for goods and
services have started on the upward
movement to which I have referred.
We must anticipate that the result
will be reflected in our figures during
the current year, even though it will be
offset to some degree by such integration
benefits as still remain to be achieved,
including the elimination of some of the
non-recurring costs.
For the rural community, increased
costs are inescapable, and once more
they will be called upon to meet the
demanding challenge to produce more,
as their only means of combating the
cost-price squeeze.
THE SEASON
We are fortunate, in fact the Nation
is fortunate, that, in general terms,
excellent seasonal conditions prevail over
those areas in which production is most
intensive.
The Southern part of the Continent (in
which our business is largest) has en-
joyed a bountiful Spring, and most of
our clients are abie to look forward with
safety and confidence as far ahead as
next year's Winter opening so, there-
fore, can we.
This comment does not embrace those
back-country areas which depend prim-
arily on Summer rainfall, and their test-
ing time lies in the few months ahead.
The current year will be one of big
rural output, following a series of bounti-
ful years, and the fears that can be
associated with the wonder as to how
long the run will last, can at least be
deferred now to the year 1965-66.
THE WOOL INDUSTRY
The Australian Wool Industry is at a
critical stage in its history.
The Wool Tax of If pence per lb to
provide funds for the Wool Board to
cover the previous levy for research and
the promotional work approved by the
principal organised grower bodies, is
under legal challenge.
The Wool Board’s recommendation of
Marketing proposals involving a reserve
price plan within the auction system, a
proposal for its financing, the control of
private selling and other factors well-
known to all, went to the Government
with the backing of the principal body
representing organised grower groups
and with apparent acceptance by other
sections of the industry, including over-
seas manufacturers, buyers and brokers.
Despite previous Government backing
to similar-type proposals in the past and
what had appeared to be general grower
support, the Board’s proposals appear to
have encountered problems at Govern-
ment level, while, gradually, evidence
seems to be growing that there is not
the unanimity among growers that earlier
support had appeared to indicate.
I do not intend to express views on
what I, or we, think should be done,
nor do I think that it is the right or role
of the Wool Broker to do so.
I hold strongly to the view that it is
the right of the growers themselves to
determine how they wish to run their
affairs and their industry, retaining an
independence which they have main-
tained for so long.
Equally do I hope that there can be
a maximum of unanimity in what they
do determine as their decisions. Wool
growers must be able to speak and act
with one strong voice a voice which
must be heard and heeded in respect of
the affairs of Australia’s most important
and productive industry.
We regard the growers as our friends
and our clients. We also regard our-
selves as their servants, whose principal
role and responsibility is to handle
efficiently their production, in the
manner in which they wish or require us
to do it.
When finality is reached, it will be our
policy to co-operate to the fullest degree,
and to play our part in making whatever
plan is decided upon work.
THE SUPERPHOSPHATE SUBSIDY
An important matter to which per-
haps I could have referred earlier, has
been the decision of the Federal Govern-
ment to grant a Superphosphate Subsidy
of £3 per ton.
The great value of this action cannot
be over-emphasised, for, in my view,
it represents one of the most important
decisions, affecting the major rural in-
dustries, that has been made for many
years.
The subsidy must be regarded as
having a twofold effect. Firstly, it is an
important offset to cost increases, and,
secondly, it has undoubtedly stimulated
increased rural production and develop-
ment.
It would be tragic if a Government
decision, which has operated so effec-
tively to produce the results I have
described, were now to be nullified by
Government financial measures which
could have the effect of restricting the
availability of .the funds required to
sustain the production and development
which the subsidy was clearly designed
to generate.
MARKETS AND PRICES
Last year’s buoyant conditions stimu-
lated .demand for rural property and
values recovered to satisfactory levels.
It is clear that these conditions are con-
tinuing in the current year.
The same remarks can be said to
apply to demand and prices for all
classes of livestock. Prices ruled at
remunerative levels last year, and are
continuing so in the current year.
Naturally, in areas where seasonal
conditions have been adverse (usually
long distances from markets), prices
have been adversely affected by the “con-
dition” of the livestock, and often by
the transport costs and problems in-
volved in movement between the vendor
grower’s property and the more-favored
areas where the demand provided the
ultimate buyer.
The greatest problems exist in WA,
where the rate of new land develop-
ment and pasture improvement is faster
than the State's flocks and herds can
cope with by natural increase.
All available transport on the Com-
monwealth Railway has been utilised
(despite the heavy costs involved in such
long distance interstate movement), but
the demand and need for additional
sheep are not being met. There would
appear to be real and continuing need
for more livestock trucks on the Com-
monwealth Railway, and it is hoped that
there are plans for the earliest possible
provision of them. Values in WA are
at a very high level, which more or less
reflects the quite-satisfactorv price levels
of the other States, plus the cost of inter-
state transport to WA.
Whilst prices at these levels are very
lucrative for the settled producer who
has an annual surplus for sale, they
could spell trouble for those who are
developing new properties where they
are reliant on too high a proportion of
borrowed funds.
The wool market can perhaps be
described as satisfactory, but not more
than that.
It seems clear that the high point of
the year did produce buyer resistance,
the effect of which revealed itself in the
March-June quarter. In the opening
quarter of the current year, there has
been no recovery from these lower levels.
Closing June rates were some five per
cent lower than at the same date in 1963,
while there has been a further slight
easing during the past four months, and
at the present time Merinos by 1\ per
cent, Crossbreds by five per cent, and
Carding Wools by 7T-10 per cent, are
all at lower levels than those ruling in
October, 1963.
Wool is being absorbed as quickly as
it is being offered, with very good clear-
ances, and it will be interesting to
observe the trend in the New Year, when
the heavy pre-Christmas disposal, aug-
mented, unfortunately, by substantial
quantities of privately-sold wool, has
passed into the production pipeline.
CLIENTS
I will close by expressing the apprecia-
tion of the Board, Management and Staff
to all our clients who have entrusted us
with their business during the year, and
who have remained loyal to their past
associations and friends within the Com-
pany.
We owe much to their patience and
tolerance in the inevitable problems and
consequent strains and irritations which
are inescapable during a “merging”
period such as we have passed through.
I thank them for their support and,
in so many cases, for their active and
spontaneous assistance.

until now, when such surprising news
may seriously affect market prices.
Moreover, proceedings during the year
made things look unnecessarily rosy. Last
year’s annual meeting was a swinging
affair, with free samples and displays
and a full 100-odd shareholders turning
up. They were told of the directors’
confidence that 1964 profits would
exceed those of 1963.
The interim report confirmed this, the
interim dividend was lifted, and it
looked as if the year’s payout would be
10 p.c. Takeover discussions did nothing
to suppress the market price. Nor did
the announcement of a share split in
September, from 20s. to ss.
Disillusioned as shareholders may be,
the time could soon be ripe for further
buying. At the annual meeting, they
would do well to roll up in their numbers
again and ask the chairman why they
had not been informed of the develop-
ment costs earlier.
Good Companions
T\espite a rather high flotation price
(l6s.) and a mediocre earning rate
history, underwriting by lan Potter and
Co. and Australian United Corporation,
combined with the switch to decimal
currency, should ensure that the 10s.
shares of Business Equipment Holdings
are launched admirably. Nevertheless,
in anybody’s language, 16s. is a lot to
pay for a company on only 9 p.c. divi-
dends and whose 10s. shares have an
asset backing of only 6s. 3d.
Profit in 1963-64 equalled 14.6 p.c.
on projected paid capital. In 1959-60
it was 13.5 p.c., then 13.7 p.c., 9.5 p.c.
and 10.4 p.c. for 1962-63. So the history
is far from buoyant.
But with decimals on the way and
such companies starting to come into
their own, it is possible that the past
is of little value as a guide to the future.
The group is the largest wholly-Aus-
tralian-owned office equipment organisa-
tion in the country. Distribution rights

cessing.
Uneasy Expansion
Tt is sincerely to be hoped that the
A expansion which Sir Arthur Warner
is planning for Electronic Industries does
not misfire. At the annual meeting, he
told shareholders that the past three
years had seen consolidation, re-organisa-
tion and an improved liquid position.
He felt, therefore, that the time was ripe
to resume expansion. TV sets, furniture

making, electronics and warehouses are
all on the list for extension.
The company has started in the ex-
panding oil-heater field, taken a block
i of shares in South East Telecasters (SA)
and has released a revolutionary two-
> wheeler bike which is reckoned to
[absolutely dethrone the conventional
| model of the past 70 years.
It could be most unwise to become
too enthusiastic over all this diversifica-
tion and expansion. In many quarters,
it is held that another three years of
consolidation and reorganisation are
needed before further expansion is under-
taken. These views are given consider-
able weight by the earnings of a low
11.3 p.c. in 1964, from which 10 p.c.
was distributed as dividend. On such
a narrow margin, expansion costs would
need to be quickly recouped and the
project made profitable for the company
to keep its head above water as far as
dividends are concerned.
As it is, the dividend has been cut
from the 121 p.c. which had prevailed
since 1948-49. In 1961, 1962 and 1963
the payout was not covered by earnings.
It will not be long, either, before the
group has to meet normal tax commit-
ments —a burden which will take some
bearing.
Love that export
QJydney-based Clifford Love and Co.,
in its preliminary report, makes
mention of export rebates in its tax pro-
vision but no indication of how this
deduction was achieved. Shareholders in
this cereal miller and foodmaker (“Uncle
Toby’s Oats” is probably one of its best
known tradenames) would like to know
just how big a part exports played in
this significant tax reduction.
It totalled £82,307 (last year £42,728)
on profit of £122,993, which compares
very favorably with the previous result
of £72,843. Depreciation was virtually
steady at £73,395. Earning rate, there-
fore, climbs to 11.1 p.c. (the 1960 level)
as against 6.6 p.c. last year.
Dividend is again H p.c., continuing
the lower rate paid last year after four
years on 8i p.c. Current price of 6s. sd.

vestor 5.8 p.c.

COMPANY ADVERTISEMENT
WITH A RECORD YEAR BEHIND, NORTH BROKEN HILL
LOOKS CONFIDENTLY TO FUTURE
HIGHLIGHTS OF CHAIRMAN’S REVIEW
At the Annual Meeting of North Broken Hill Limited held in Melbourne on
Thursday, October 29, 1964, the Chairman of Directors, Mr M, L. Baillieu,
stated that the feature of the year under review was, from the point of every-
one interested in the company, the most successful year since its inception.
The 497,558 tons of ore treated was a record
for the North Mine, excluding output from
the British and Junction Sections when
they were owned by this Company. The
value of Mine Production, £9,010,228, and
the surplus from operations of £2,435,954,
(after royalty and tax of £2,618,000) were
also records. Further, North’s net income
from investments, £828,883 after deducting
attributable tax, was the highest ever re-
ceived by the company.
No effort had been spared over the years
and very large sums of money had been
spent in equipping the mine to operate as
efficiently as possible. Ffowever, the achieve-
ment of maximum advantage from modern
equipment required detailed and long range
planning by the staff, and intelligent use of
equipment by the men who handled it. The
effectiveness and loyalty of North’s em-
ployees were of prime importance in
achieving the improved result.
• LEAD, ZINC AND SILVER PRICES
Mr Baillieu said that another major factor
contributing to the result had been the high
price of lead. The average price realised
was £9O/12/2 a ton compared to the pre-
vious year’s price of £66/2/4.
Sales of lead exceeded production by more
than 3,000 tons.
Zinc concentrates also played a notable
part. The demand by treaters of concentrate
was very strong and that fact had lowered
the Zinc concentrate returning charges in
favor of the mine, and North’s return from
Zinc concentrate had been greater than
the London Metal Exchange prices for Zinc
indicated.
Finally, the higher output had the twofold
result of keepirtg production costs down to
a minimum whilst at the same time pro-
viding increased quantities of lead zinc and
silver for sale at the higher price.
• FUTURE OF THE MINE
Turning to the mine’s future, Mr Baillieu
said that diamond drilling indicated that
some 10 million tons of high grade ore
existed in the mine down to, and including,
the No. 30 level (4,120 feet), which was
served by No. 3 shaft. Developmental work
was currently taking place at a rate at
least equivalent to that at which the ore
was being mined, and no difficulty was
expected in keeping ahead comfortably of
mining requirements.
North had sufficient reserves to meet
mining needs for some 20 to 25 years. It
was believed that the grade of reserves
would be approximately the same as that
now being mined.
9 BELOW THE No. 30 LEVEL
Mr Baillieu said that to determine what
lay below No. 30 level was a most in-
teresting study. This was being pursued with
all speed. The drive on the level was being
extended northwards with the intention of
establishing sites to drill the Northern end
of the orebodies. Preliminary drilling from
the 4,120 feet level had indicated a southern
orebody at the 4,420 feet horizon, approxi-
mately in size that at present indicated on
the 4,120 level which appeared to be of
the order of 600,000 tons.
It was fair to assume that the orebodies had
a good potential below the No. 30 level.
Experience showed it was desirable to plan
development as far ahead as practicable
and take advantage of the periods of buoy-
ancy of the Company’s revenues to assure
its future by putting such plans into effect.
0 NORTHERN LEASES
Mr Baillieu said that North’s leases which
extended over considerable areas north of
the mine’s known orebodies came into a
different category of development and
exploration.
These leases had been tested by the Induced
Polarisation method and a number of
anomalies had been disclosed. Exploration
by more intensive diamond drilling would
be speeded up. Two new drilling machines
would shortly be in operation.
The leases nearer the mine are held by
North, whilst those farther to the north
are held by Broken Hill South (30%
interest) and by North (70% interest).
0 SEARCH FOR MINERALS
The obligation of successful mines to foster
the search for minerals outside their own
particular mining areas was well appreciated
by the Board.
Consistent with resources available North
was always prepared to co-operate in any
well organised enterprise, said Mr Baillieu.
Ample evidence of this was given through
North’s participating with Broken Hill South
Ltd. and Electrolytic Zinc Company of
Australasia Ltd. in both an Australia-wide
search for minerals and the prospecting of
areas to the south of Broken Hill; through
North’s interests with Western Mining
Corporation Limited and Broken Hill South
Limited, in the Moonta-Wallaroo district in
South Australia; through its joining with
Pickands Mather International and others,
in the Kimberley district exploration; through
participation in Western Aluminium N.L.,
which led to the establishment of Alcoa of
Australia Pty. Ltd.; through North’s recent
investment in Beach Petroleum.
0 SEARCH FOR OIL
Mr Baillieu said that the Directors believed
it was appropriate for North to take part
in the search for oil in Australia. North
and Broken Hill South had between them
subscribed 5 million 5/- shares in Beach
Petroleum N.L. North’s proportion was
3,250,000 shares or 32.5% of the present
issued capital of Beach Petroleum N.L. In
the area held by Beach Petroleum, in the
Amadeus Basin on the Southern Boundary
of the Northern Territory, gravity and
seismic testing had established geologically
attractive structures of substantial size.
Plans for a possible partnership for a farm-
out of part of the area were under con-
sideration.
• INVESTMENTS
Referring to the record income of £828,883
from investments, Mr Baillieu said the
increase was due partly to higher dividends
received but mainly to interest received on
additional surplus funds.
Dealing with investments that had returned
no dividend he said that North held 3
million shares (or 12%) in Alcoa of
Australia Pty. Ltd., which had continued
its rapid developnfent. It must be expected
that its 1964 results would reflect the
difficulties associated with starting up a
new capacity and process. The Board took
a most optimistic view of the future of
Alcoa and had no doubt that Alcoa would
become a substantial contributor to its
revenue.
The second important investment from
which no dividend was received was The
Electrolytic Refining and Smelting Com-
pany of Australia Ltd. The position of the
E.R. & S. had improved in the last two
years and it had recently contracted to
treat the whole of Cobar Mine's output of
copper concentrates for 10 years.
Funds for E.R. & S. additional plant would
be financed partly out of its cash flow and
partly by borrowings. The new outlay on
plant to enable it to handle the total pro-
jected output of the Cobar Company would
be to the order of £1,750,000.
North’s most important investment in other
companies was in the Broken Hill Associated
Smelters Pty. Ltd. which had recently in-
creased its dividend to 13%.
B.H.A.S. derived its revenue from treating
lead concentrates from Broken Hill and
partly from its coal mines and coke works
in NSW. It is also the owner of a large
slag dump at Pt Pirie which was the sub-
ject of an intensive study in connection with
the extraction of zinc and lead.
The next most important investment held
by North was its 1,647,778 shares in Metal
Manufactures Ltd., which had a satisfactory
year.
As from January Ist, 1964, Metal Manu-
factures in exchange for an issue of further
shares to British Insulated Callender’s
Cables (Aust.) Pty. Ltd. acquired that com-
pany’s interests in a number of Australian
Companies manufacturing power and com-
munication cables.
Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation Pty.
Ltd., in which North was a shareholder
had another successful year.
• CONCLUSION
Mr Baillieu concluded his review by stating
that the current financial year had begun
most satisfactorily and it was evident that
if present conditions continued the surplus
from operations in 1964/65 would be even
larger than the record of the year under
review.

and depreciation. However, an extra
depreciation provision of £21,000 just
about wipes out this profit, so no final
dividend is being distributed. Share-
holders have been left with only the
interim 4 p.c. Payouts have normally
totalled 8 "p.c.
In explanation, directors say the
depreciation is on plant and would
normally have been written off over
seven years. They assure shareholders
that a satisfactory dividend will be
resumed this year and maintained. This
is no justification for their actions. What
has happened to render the situation
abnormal and necessitate this unusual
step?
A full explanation is needed as, on
the surface of things, it appears that
directors are reducing charges against
future years, which they possibly fear
could be too poor to carry such charges.
A little light obviously needs to be shed
on the situation.
Anti Tight Money
Special pleading of a high order came
from the chairman of Elder Smith
Goldsbrough Mort, Sir Philip Mcßride, at
the company’s annual meeting. He ex-
pressed firm resentment of any possible
tight-money policy, firstly for the re-
strictions it could impose on Australia’s
major export industries and secondly for
the undue strain it placed upon the
funds available from the pastoral houses.
It must have fascinated many people
to learn that twenty-three pastoral com-
panies in Australia had a total of £126.2
million out on loan to the rural com-
munity at September 30.
Sir Philip still stands in trepidation of
the position created in 1960, as his an-
nual report also showed: “If there is
any tightening of trading bank lending,
the pressures on pastoral houses could
reproduce the same problems of avail-
able funds that were experienced four
years ago.”
He argued for the continuous flow of
finance to sustain a very vigorous rural
industry, already stimulated by the super-
phosphate bounty and which had suc-
ceeded in tremendously expanding out-
put without the disturbance of labor pro-
blems.
Perhaps shareholders may be able to
join in fairly soon!
Engineer Better
/Construction equipment engineer Tutt
Bryant Ltd continues its recovery
to 1960 profit levels with a £72,679 lift
to £280,533 for the year to June 30.
Profit in 1960 was £345,511, but, follow-
ing difficulties in the engineering busi-
ness, slumped to £174,895 in 1962.
Latest recovery gives an earning rate of
18.7 p.c. compared with last year’s 13.8
p.c.
It was struck after £61,340 higher tax
of £99,577 and £20,050 lower deprecia-
tion at £114,938. As pointed out in the
preliminary report, tax provision takes
into account income earned in New
Guinea which is subject to a lower rate.
The 10 p.c. dividend, paid for the 11th
successive year, returns 5.8 p.c. to
investors who buy in at the present price
of Bs. 6d.
By Gad
T. Gadsden’s reCopd 1963-64 profit and
the final 4 p.c. dividend suggests the
1964-65 will see a return to the regular
8 p.c. dividends paid from 1955 to 1963.
The year’s total payout is only 7 p.c.,
as the interim was cut to 3 p.c. “in
pursuance of a policy to strengthen the
company’s reserves”.
The fact that the final payout has
been maintained seems to indicate either
that directors have decided to let the
reserves be, or that this was not the
reason for their dividend cut in the first
place. Maintenance of the final payout,
on the face of things, endorses the latter
thought.
At June 30 last, reserves totalled £1.55
million and paid capital £6.57 million.
Although this ratio could be better,
adding £66,000-odd to reserves, through
a one p.c. dividend cut, would not make
much difference. Surely the company is
aware that it does most good for share-
holders by maintaining dividends, not
strengthening reserves, which, by the
way, could hardly be considered weak.
Capitalising Meat
\ nderson Meat Industries is to raise
£230,022 with a par issue of ordin-
ary shares and placements of ordinary
and preference capital. Shareholders
will be entitled to one 20s. share for
every ten they hold.
The redeemable preference share issue
will involve 150,000 20s. shares at-6f
p.c. interest. Applicants to this issue
have the right to take up one new ss.
ordinary share for every £lO of prefer-
ence shares subscribed.
For the first time since 1959 the
company is paying a dividend 7i p.c.
which returns shareholders 5.5 p.c.'
on the current price of 275. 6d. Lapse in
dividends started in 1960, following a
huge loss of £186,262. Tax benefits
from this loss have apparently been
used up.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
No Long Delay for a Bonus
Minster raises other questions on share value
Tt is likely that, in 1957, investors
thought that the three-for-four bonus
issue which Minster Ltd had made in the
August of the previous year meant that
there would be little more to be had from
this stock for some years. In any event,
the last sale in September, 1957, was
made at 225. 6d. and this price repre-
sented 9.7 times the per share earnings of
the 1956-57 year and the dividend yield
was 6.8 p.c.
From an investment then of, say, £225
in 200 Minster shares, there would now
be a capital appreciation of £1290
about 26 p.c. per annum compound. The
dividend has been increased to twice what
it was in 1957, so that over the period
from 1957 to 1964 the average return
from dividends would have been roughly
10 p.c. All-in-all, a purchaser of Minster
shares in 1957 has received a return of at
least 35 p.c. per annum on his money.
The seller probably missed one of the
best opportunities on the Australian
stock exchanges.
However, this is all in the past. But it
would be as well to look at the rates of
growth in earnings and dividends that
may be regarded as being responsible for
the substantial increase in the share price.
The following indices show this growth:
1957 1958 1961 1962 1963 1964
Earnings 100 135 239 263 281 358
Dividends 100 100 200 200 200 200
Net tangible
assets 100 114 201 228 251 298
The increase in net tangible assets per
share is interesting, as it illustrates the
consistency of the growth. Not only have
earnings expanded rapidly. The plough-
back has been sufficient to maintain net
assets in very roughly the same propor-
tions.
In fact, the return on net tangible
assets from earnings would have pro-
gressed as follows:
1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964
Earnings as a
percentage ot
net tangible
assets 31.1 33.3 24.9 24.3 23.7 25.1
It is from this series only that one
gains the impression of a levelling-off or
even a slight downturn in the growth
from 1960 through to 1963. However,
1964 produced an upturn which carried
this ratio back to just above the 1958
level.
So far as the Minster group is con-
cerned, this period—l96l to 1963 in-
clusive seems to have been a period of
development, associated with a modest
diversification. Perhaps the word “diversi-
fication” is too strong, because it would
seem that Minster has never diversified
in the strict sense of the word. All its
activities are closely allied to the pro-
duction of rubber-backed carpets. Never-
theless, in 1960, Minster took a major
interest with Clyde Industries in the Rub-
ber Regenerating Co. Pty Ltd. A short
while later two companies were acquired
(the first acquisitions for a period of four
years). One was a wholesaler of floor
coverings, Bolton Trading Co. Pty Ltd,
and the other was E. R. Lovell Pty Ltd,
a manufacturer of surgical sutures. It can
only be guessed that the interest which
prompted the acquisition of E. R. Lovell
stemmed from the success of Gamma
Sterilisation Pty Ltd. This latter company
had been formed in 1958-59, mainly to
provide sterilisation facilities for the im-
ported goats’ hair from which “West-
minster” carpets are made. The extension
of such activities to the medical and sur-
gical professions was a logical step.
A part from noting the modest decline
in the rate of return on net share-
holders’ funds, it is difficult to gain much
information, from Minster’s extremely
brief reports, on the results of these ven-
tures. So far as the Rubber Regenerating
Co. is concerned, it would seem that the
initial investment was £150,000, which
was subsequently increased to £200,000.
The total investment in the plant, etc.,
was to have been approximately £lm.,
though this figure was no doubt to have
been made up of equity and borrowings
in roughly equal proportions. Min-
ster’s initial 40 p.c. interest was in-
creased to approximately 57 p.c. when
its subsidiary was allotted 200,000 £1
shares in February, 1963. The present
minority shareholders, therefore, appa-
rently subscribed £300,000 and the
figure appearing in the 1964 balance
sheet of Minster Ltd for minority share-
holders’ interests is £155,060. It might
be assumed, then, that losses to date by
the Rubber Regenerating Co. Pty Ltd
amount to about £337,000. The loss
in the 1963-64 year seems to have been
about £144,000 on the basis of the re-
duction in minority shareholders’ inter-
ests from 1962-63 to 1963-64. As this
loss would have been included as to
£82,000 approximately in Minster’s con-
solidated accounts, the result for the
group, excluding Rubber Regenerating,
could have been that much greater.
At June 30, 1964, the group was very
liquid, with £665,000 held as “short-
term investments” —an increase of
£625,000 on the year. The group’s
capacity to generate funds is demonstra-
ted by what might be called the “net
cash position”; that is, cash and short-
term investments less bank overdraft and
short-term borrowings. The change in
this position from year to year over the
last five years has been as follows:
Year ended
June 30 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964
(£'000)
Increase/
(Decrease) 100 (734) 307 140 602
The decrease in the 1961 year arises
not only from the downturn in economic
activity but mainly from the substantial
investment made in buildings and plant
of about £662,000 and in Rubber Re-
generating of £150,000.
While the expected bonus issue has
not yet occurred, it is likely that it will
not be too long delayed. The last two
issues had the effect of bringing the
dividend cover below 2 to 1. As the
dividend currently is covered not less
than 2.7 times, another l-for-2 issue
(which would bring the cover down to 1.8
times as after the 1960 issue) seems
quite likely.
The question is “When?”. Another
question is: ”How will the present short-
term investments be permanently in-
vested?”

Exciting Year Ahead
Optical Industries’ building plans
Shareholders of Optical Industries Ltd
who were fortunate enough to get
shares when the company made its public
issue in 1956, and who have taken up
all their entitlements since, have seen
their investment grow almost seven times
without taking into consideration the
dividend return.
They have been able to participate in
a one-for-five issue at par in 1958, the
following year another one-for-five issue,
this time at a 50 p.c. premium, and two
bonus issues—a one-for-five in 1962 and
another on the same basis in the latest
year.
The original placement to qualify for
stock exchange listing was 276,900 10s.
shares at 10s. 3d. plus charges. Since
then, the various issues, including several
,for the acquisition of assets, have raised
I paid-up capital to £920,248 after the
'latest bonus.
The company can trace its history back
to about 1935, although the present
company was formed in 1953 to acquire
all the issued capital of Optical Pre-
i scriptions Spectacle Makers Pty Ltd,
which operated in most States and larger
country areas making and fitting spec-
tacles to doctors’ prescriptions, and
making and retailing optical goods.
There are now manufacturing com-
panies in New South Wales, Victoria,
Queensland and South Australia. OPSM
branches are in New South Wales (32 in
'the metropolitan area and 18 in country
centres), Victoria (11 city and 11
country), Canberra (1), Queensland (7),
Adelaide (4), Western Australia (2);
in all, 86 selling centres.
Profit history has been good, with
increases recorded in each year since
! listing and earnings covering the divi-
dend on each occasion more than twice.
Dividend in the first three years of list-
ing was 10 p.c., followed by four years
of 12i p.c. Last year, after a record pro-
fit, the rate was raised to 15 p.c.
Profit for the latest year was £252,701,
'equal to 33 p.c. on capital, or 27.5 p.c.
on the bonus-increased capital. On this
basis, the 15 p.c. dividend rate does not
seem to be in danger. The 1964 profit
is almost three times the £92,011 earned
in the first year of listing.
The latest profit is after a substantial
increase in tax provision, from £122,123
to £178,082. Depreciation was lifted
from £45,196 to £51,169. All the sub-
sidiaries in the group were not profitable
I in the latest year and losses totalling
' £10,524 were offset against profits of
others of the group.
The company, with large amounts
tied up in freehold property, relies to a
large extent on mortgage borrowings for
its financing needs. The latest accounts
show that borrowings from this source
at June 30 stood at £215,492, of which
£151,433 was due for repayment before
the end of the year. In addition, there
was £123,487 in interest-bearing deposits
and loans, of which £32,690 was repay-
able in the current 12 months.
The company at last balance date was
particularly liquid. Although cash at the
bank was down from £81,231 to £45,703,
it had £lOO,OOO on short-term deposits.
Investments were up from £67,917 to
£75,189, including £41,537 in loans on
mortgage.
Stocks on hand showed a small in-
crease from £358,981 to £383,694, while
trade debtors were up from £120,895 to
£138,532, indicating another good year.
The company owns most of its pre-
mises. Thus freehold property appears
in the books at cost at £990,276, and at
this figure are probably considerably
under-valued. Plant and fittings, at cost,
appear at £743,343, against which the
company has provided £353,173 for
depreciation.
The reserve position is strong, with
revenue reserves of £637,871 and capital
reserves, (shares premiums) of £3751.
The bonus issue was made from a re-
valuation of Optical Prescriptions Spec-
tacle Makers Pty Ltd.
The company has exciting plans for
the current year, including the redevelop-
ment of the site of its 115-year-old
“mansion” in Macquarie St, Sydney—its
head office. The building at present on
the site, described in historical docu-
ments of the Sydney area as a mansion,
is quite unsuitable for its present use.
Directors plan to rebuild, using part of

NALLY LTD
Fairly Priced
Just Now
the disruption caused by a fire
which destroyed the company’s
main warehouse and stocks last Decem-
ber, Nally Ltd was able to lift profit by
almost 25 p.c. in the year to June 30
last.
In fact, the fire seems to have aided
rather than retarded the company for,
on the site of the old warehouse, it has
built a new one of twice the capacity,
although the cost of the rebuilding pro-
gramme was heavier than expected.
The company was formed in 1930 to
take over as a going concern the business
of electrical and mechanical engineers
and manufacturer of phenol resin and
similar products carried on at the Sydney
suburb of Glebe by Nally Products Ltd.
Stock Exchange listing was obtained in
1947, with a paid-up capital of £30,000
in 10s. shares.
Growth of capital has been fairly
rapid and today stands at £309,142 in
ss. ordinary shares. The shares were
split to the smaller unit in 1951. Be-
tween 1947 and 1958, shareholders par-
ticipated in six cash issues of shares and
two issues of unsecured notes convertible
into ordinary shares at par on maturity.
In addition a small share issue was made
in 1961 to finance the payment on new
factory premises.
Despite these, in recent years the com-
pany has experienced liquidity problems
and has had to rely on fixed interest
borrowings to a laree extent.

30 last, show mortgage loans of

£53,438 (down from £57,188 a year
earlier) and £50,000 in 81 p.c. unsecured
notes, redeemable in 1973, held by insti-
tutions. In addition there are still cur-
rent £75,000 in 8 p.c. ss. unsecured
notes, which convert into ordinary shares
on November 15, 1965.
Bank overdraft is higher, up from
£118,792 to £137,036, and trade credi-
tors are up from £138,441 to £182,581.
However, on the other side of the ledger,
trade and other debtors are up from
£127,800 to £178,056. Stock is down
slightly from £200,292 to £199,598.
The reserve position is sound, with
total reserves of £82,179, subject to in-
tangible items of £5OO, giving an assets
backing for each ss. share of 6s. 4d.
Capital reserves total £22,857.
Despite fluctuations in earnings, the
company has paid a 10 p.c. dividend
since 1954. In 1957 and again in 1963,
profit failed to cover the payout. The
1963 profit of £26,457 was equal to 8.7
p.c. on capital, while last year’s earn-
ings of £31,280 covered the payout by
only £366. However, the company
charged the extra costs arising from the
rebuilding programme against last year’s
profit.
Trading in the industry, which covers
the manufacture and distribution of
plastic items of houseware and mould-
ings for industry, has continued to be
very competitive, yet sales last year were
slightly higher than in 1962-63.
The company, although Sydney-based,
operates through subsidiary companies in
Victoria, South Australia and Queens-
land.
The current year should show an
improvement on the 1963-64 figures, de5£53,438
pite continuation of the rebuilding pro-
gramme. The present factory is being
extended to house additional items of
plant. Capital commitment on new
buildings is £27,500, while the com-
pany plans to spend £72,500 for new
plant. Finance for this expenditure has
been arranged.
Because of the heavy external borrow-
ings, the company appears to be faced
with making another call on share-
holders, although, unless there is a
marked improvement in earnings, the
10 p.c. dividend may be in danger.
The current year has opened on a
bright note, Trading since June has
shown a considerable improvement and
forward orders on hand are satisfactory.
The 5s. shares are currently selling
around 6s. to show a dividend and earn-
ings yield of 8.3 p.c. At this level they
appear to be fairly priced.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Placid Politics and Market
The local scene almost undisturbed
Tf the market has been dull, then world
events certainly have not. Mr Wilson
is over there intent upon destroying the
patches of paradise that existed for some
capitalists.
On the other side of the Atlantic, the
Americans proved that they’re not such
a crazy race after all by overwhelmingly
voting President Johnson back into
power.
However, the more placid local poli-
tical scene fits exactly with the present
market. There are only isolated cases of
excitement. Kolotex recovered the 2s. it
had lost the previous week, when the
resignation of two of the directors was
announced. These resignations in rt o
way affected the business, which app a .
rently is booming along. <
Another sudden move was the ss. rise!
in G. E. Crane shares. If I’d still been
holding these shares I would have been
delighted. Unfortunately, I had just sold
them.
In contrast, Sydney Mutual Insurance
10s. shares have been rock steady at/
325. 3d. When I bought these shares iJ
late September, the company had not
announced its full profit for the 1963-6
year. As it turned out, profits wer
steady and so equal to about 34 p.c. o|
the old capital again. An insurance share
selling on an earnings yield in excess ot
10 p.c. is quite something.
The other purchase this week was 200/
Pioneer Sugar at 61s. Whereas sugai
shares bounded up in 1963, they have
tumbled down equally quickly in 1964
Pioneer Sugar is no exception, having
been as high as 78s. 9d. early this year,
So far the market has hardly flickered
with the news of the l-for-2 bonus.'
Directors must have pretty sound reasons
for a bonus issue of this size, so the
shares ex bonus at 40s. should look
cheap.
This week CSR and Blue Metal came*
good with a cheque of £l2B. On top of
this £l5 profit was the £79 profit from
Warburton Franki and the £lO2 profit
(including dividends) from the balance
of the Tableland Tin. Given time, War-
burton Franki should rise to the 255.
level again. The tin price seems a bit
jittery, so I’m happy to take the profit
on Tableland, and also the £3O loss on
another tin share, Ardlethan.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
After the UK Election
Some changes in agricultural policy
With Labor in control in Britain, if
" only by a slender margin, some
changes in British agricultural policy
seem certain. Broadly speaking, though,
it appears that the bulk of Australia’s
primary products exported to Britain will
be safe. The Minister for Trade, Mr
McEwen, has indicated that his depart-
ment is seeking the exact details of the
new British import regulations. He
apparently feels there is no cause for
alarm as far as our “traditional” primary
exports are concerned.
What may be of interest, over and
above these trade details, is the spirit of
the new Labor attitude in Britain and
its likely effect on Labor theory in this
country. British Labor and Australian
Labor may be close in some areas. In
agriculture they are poles apart.
Australian Labor, both at Federal and
State levels, seems tied to the 19th-
century idea that all the ills besetting
agriculture will be solved by “cutting up
the big estates”. The “unlock the lands”
theory is valid only in a time, and place,
where the farm is a means of living as
well as a means of earning a livelihood.
When, in earlier times, the farmer
obtained his own food, clothing and sus-
tenance from his land and his animals,
then it was quite reasonable to argue
that large estates must be cut up and
shared out for the common good. Today,
those few people who really do live off
their land are regarded as eccentrics.
The time and the place is no more, yet
Australian Labor clings to its historic
attitudes.
British Labor is, indeed, concerned
with the lot of the small farmer where
he still exists. Its advice to the “wheel-
barrow farmer”, as he is termed in
Britain, is to form a co-operative farm
with similarly placed men. It goes
further, however, and actually will assist
those small farmers who wish to get out
altogether by setting up a training
scheme to fit them for other industries.
British Labor has also indicated that
it will bring in a pension scheme for
farmers on very small holdings, who can
no longer stand the burden of farming
and who are too old to secure other
employment.
These ideas appear to have merit.
It is a general misconception in Aus-
tralia that Britain is a “patchwork quilt”
of small farmholdings tended by straw-
chewing rustics. Similar misconceptions
about Ireland are often held by Aus-
tralians of Irish extraction, who readily
conjure up thoughts of a faraway birth-
place peopled by characters out of an
O’Casey play.
In actual fact, Britain today (and
Ireland more so) has farms which are
large by any standards. Farms of 1000
acres and over are usual. In the Scottish
hill country, sheep runs of 200,000 acres
are not uncommon.
Rotational farming (the “patchwork
quilt”) has given way to factory farms
(basically feedlot operations), “corn”
(wheat, oats or barley), and grassland
farming. It is all highly intensified,
highly efficient and highly specialised. It
absorbs less than 4 p.c. of the working
population.
And it is highly subsidised. This is
where comparisons with Australian
methods are dangerous. British farm
supports and subsidies run at more than
£3OO million a year.
All the parties before the general
election, Tory, Labor and Liberal,
promised that the support system would
continue.
Supports need not necessarily be direct
subsidies. For this reason it is not per-
haps entirely true to state that the only
Australian primary industry which is
supported is dairying. Yet with a £l2
million yearly subsidy, it is commonly
said that dairying is our only subsidised
primary industry.
Wheat, dried fruits and cotton would
be supported, however, if things got
really bad (the framework for support is
in existence) and the Government con-
tribution to wool promotion (£4 million
a year) could probably be described as
a farm support. The fact remains that
our primary industries are not supported
at anything like the level of British
farming.
Under Labor, British farm supports
are more likely to increase than decrease.
In a pre-election speech Prime Minister
Harold Wilson said: “One simple prin-
ciple should regulate Labor planning for
agriculture; first place should be given to
home-produced supplies, second place to
Commonwealth supplies, and the remain-

jng gap should be filled with planned im-
ports from other countries.
“Labor will place a world food plan
before the United Nations to channel
surpluses to the deficit areas and
will conclude international commodity
agreements where possible. “Commodity
commissions will be established for the
major imported foodstuffs. These will
be responsible for assessing demand,
regulating imports, concluding long-term
agreements, stabilising prices and in-
tegrating all supplies.”
The new British Minister for Agri-
culture is Mr Fred Peart. “Effective
marketing” was one of his mainstays
during the election.
He said: “Over a period of years we
have evolved excellent systems of mar-
keting for certain home-grown com-
modities. Valuable experience has been
gained by existing producers boards.
However, there are still no satisfactory
marketing arrangements for many im-
portant commodities.
“The Labor Party has always been
anxious, in and out of office, to en-
courage producers to establish statutory
marketing boards with real powers.”
It seems quite clear that marketing,
and this means producer-controlled mar-
keting, will be the big thing in Labor’s
plans for agriculture.
The complete election platform policy
may be summarised as follows:
• A long-term production plan (five
years at least) aimed at lifting farmers
and workers’ incomes to the level of
their equivalents in industry.
• To maintain the system of guaran-
teed prices (farm supports),
• To encourage producers to establish
marketing boards, “with real powers” for
all major commodities.
• Commodity commissions, to control
the more important food imports (inter-
national commodity agreements).
• To submit proposals to the United
Nations for a world food board.
• To create a Land Board to purchase
holdings which are unprofitable.
• To encourage co-operation amongst
small farmers.
• To set up a retraining scheme for
those who wish to leave agriculture.
Ane other very important plank in the
Labor platform, which might well be
examined closely by Labor and Liberal
theorists in this country, is the establish-
ment of a special agricultural credit
organisation. Such a move in Australia
would be far more valuable than cutting
up remote sheep stations into small lots
which, as a policy, can only satisfy a
fraction of those people wanting farms.
There are literally thousands of farms
on the market which are already of
proven economic size and which few
young men can afford to buy. While
there is a limit, obviously, beyond which
farms ought not justly to go, it is quite
ridiculous to pursue a policy of cutting
up estates, either directly by resumption
or indirectly by death duties, just be-
cause they happen to be large in size.
The economic unit is what counts, not
the number of acres. With reasonable
credit facilities, the number of economic
units in this country could be increased
vastly.
So much for theory. With its narrow
margin, can British Labor do any of the
things it says it will? Strictly in the
agricultural sphere, it appears that it
may well do so. If it does not, and if
there is another election and the Con-
servatives get back, much of Labor’s
platform may be carried out anyway.
Before the election the British National
Farmers’ Union, which really does repre-
sent all sections of British farming,
issued a manifesto basically demanding
that farm incomes be increased by 25
p.c.
HThis would be achieved by expanding
A home food production even further
—at the expense of imports. Exports
(last year surprisingly worth £6O million)
would be increased. Improved marketing
arrangements (i.e., producer - controlled
boards) are, in the NFU view, a matter
of the greatest urgency.
Both Labor and Conservative Parties
are under pressure from the NFU.
In his election speeches, the outgoing
Conservative Minister for Agriculture,
Mr Christopher Soames, indicated that
he agreed with all these principles except,
in certain details, the one on marketing.
But marketing improvements, he said,
would be initiated. His party would
achieve these improvements, however, by
interfering as little as possible with
normal trading and farming operations.
He suggested that the Labor plans for
commodity commissions were a first step
towards nationalisation of farming.
In Australian eyes, both the Labor and
the Conservative approach appear to
have much in common. Each, by our
standards, has the ring of nationalisation.
Yet when one compares British Labor
attitudes with those of Australian Labor,
it becomes clear that it is always risky
to accept a word such as “nationalisa-
tion” at its face value.
Also, we ought not to accept Mr
Wilson’s • simplification that the “Com-
monwealth will come second to home
production” at its face value either.
Britain is already satisfying about 70
p.c. of her food needs through her
approach to farming. No matter how
much it costs her, she seems determined
to increase the percentage, whether under
a Conservative or a Labor Government.
We can be second and still a poor
second.
Regardless, too, of the party in power,
the demands of British farmers for a
bigger say in marketing seem sure to be
met. The Conservatives, before they
went out of office, did in fact formulate
a floor price system for the marketing
of meat. The Conservatives also had no
less a person than the “socialist brains
truster” Sir Solly Zuckerman draw up
a plan for the “rationalisation” of the
relatively few small holdings left in
Britain. The new Labor plan is a de-
velopment of this.
How the Conservative policy is any
less nationalistic than the Labor is, for
an Australian, difficult to appreciate.
The London School of Economics boys
are calling the tune and will continue to
do so.
Wool, fortunately, is not a foodstuff
and we can be confident that we will
remain the UK textile industry’s main
supplier. Wool production is of less
importance than sugar beet in Britain’s
overall farm structure.
