the price of land at BLACKHEATH during the past three

therefore, to

DR. KELLY’S REPUTATION IS SO THOROUGHLY ESTABLISHED THAT IT WILL
ONLY BE NECESSARY FOR HIM TO INTIMATE THAT HE IS PRACTISING AS A
SPECIALIST TO BE APPRECIATED AS A BENEFACTOR TO SUFFERING MANKIND. AS
THE GREATER PORTION OP THE NEW SOUTH WALES PUBLIC IS AWARE, DR. KELLY
IS A LEGALLY QUALIFIED AND REGISTERED PHYSICIAN, AND HAS BY PAR THE
LARGEST PRACTICE IN THE COLONIES, MANY PERSONS AT A DISTANCE, HOWEVER,
ARE UNAWARE OP HIS GREAT SUCCESS, AS, HITHERTO, HE HAS REFRAINED PROM
ADVERTISING. HENCE, TO WIDEN THE SPHERE OP HIS USEFULNESS, HE HAS
DETERMINED, BY MEANS OP ADVERTISING, TO MAKE HIMSELF KNOWN IN REMOTE
DISTRICTS WHERE HIS REPUTATION MAY NOT YET HAVE TRAVELLED. AS THE
QUESTION MAY ARISE, WHY DOES SO EMINENT A PHYSICIAN AS DR, KELLY FIND
IT NECESSARY TO ADVERTISE, HE MAY REPLY TO ONE AND ALL AS FOLLOWS
IP THERE IS A PERSON ON EARTH TO BE PITIED IT IS HE WHO IS OBLIGED
TO ASSOCIATE WITH HIS FELLOW BEINGS WHILE HIS MIND 13 CONSTANTLY
HARASSED AND TORTURED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OP

HE LOOKS HAGGARD AND SHEEPISH. HE IS NERVOUS IN PUBLIC, AND EXTREMELY
GIRLISH AND BACKWARD IN LADIES’ SOCIETY. THE VICTIM OP THIS, THE MOST
DANGEROUS OF ALL VICES, IP NOT RELIEVED, SOON REACHES A STATE WHICH MUST
END IN LIFE-LONG MISERY. HE MUST ULTIMATELY SINK TO THE LOWEST STAGE
OP DEGRADATION AND SHAME. DR. KELLY MAINTAINS THAT THE PHYSICIAN WHO
HAS THE POWER TO CURE, AND REMAINS SILENT, IS GUILTY OP AN UNPARDONABLE
SIN OF OMISSION. PERSONS WHO READ HIS GREAT WORK ON THIS SUBJECT WILL
BE SHOWN THE INEVITABLE RESULT OP THE BAD HABITS, AND IN MOST
INSTANCES SUFFICIENTLY EARLY IN LIFE TO ENABLE THEM
TO SEE THEIR FOLLY
BEFORE ANY DISEASE HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OP THEM, THE BOOK WILL ALSO
SHOW THEM CLEARLY
HOW TO CURE THE DISEASE WITHOUT
THE ASSISTANCE OF PHYSICIAN OR CHEMIST.
MANY PERSONS WONDER WHY THEIR MEMORY IS NOT SO RETENTIVE, AND THEIR
GENERAL INTELLECT NOT SO CLEAR AND STRONG AS THEY FORMERLY WERE.
DR. KELLY’S BOOK WILL EXPLAIN THE CAUSE IN PLAIN AND SIMPLE LANGUAGE.
THEREFORE, EVEN THOUGH YOU BE FREE FROM DISEASE, SEND FOR THIS GREAT
MEDICAL WORK, THAT YOU MAY BE ENABLED TO ADVISE OTHERS AFTER PERUSING
ITS PAGES. VERY FREQUENTLY THIS MAY BE DONE BEFORE ANY GREAT HAEM
HAS TAKEN PLACE.

SATURDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1891.
A Question for the N.S.W. Labour
Party.
Every man has his price except the man
who has the price. In other words, no man
is to bo so much pitied as the man who
places his supreme good in the present
enjoyment of so much worldly gear. Every
man has his price, but the price may not be
in the shape of money. There is some one
thing around which the hopes and aspira-
tions of most men cling - it may be ease,
competence, leisure, honour, love, retire-
ment, what-not. One man alone in the
world is so wise that he is an eternal fool.
He has the price of everybody else—money.
He doesn’t want for anything, because he
holds in his cheque-book the sum of human
endeavour—the acme of human desire.
Alexander wept when he had no fresh
worlds to conquer. So the mere man
of money is necessarily supremely un-
happy, because nobody holds the' talis-
man by which his inmost nonentity of a
soul can be conjured. Building so low,
he never lifts his ediGce above the founda-
tion, and, what is also a very sad thing for
him, he has a supreme contempt for all
buildings not reared over a
bank-vault.
When money is the touch-stone of wisdom
everybody hastens to be wise. It is more or
less felt, even by such of the Labour-mem-
bers in the New South Wales Parliament
who have just begun to blossom into tailor-
cut clothes, that poverty is a sad thing, a
reprehensible thing ; which, if not exactly
criminal, is at least hardly respectable.
A little while ago, in the first democratic
flush of an election-freshening of blood,
the “one-man-one-vote'’ principle lifted
its head quite boldly, and it was rather
rashly advanced that a pauper even might
be a man, not sunk so low as to demand
either clergyman’s or medico’s attestation to
the fact. To-day a change has come over the
dream of Caesar. The soldier and the police-
man are each to have a vote ; the “pauper”
is not to have a vote. A soldier is a man,
even a policeman might be considered one ;
but a pauper is only the astral phantom of a
man that has been. And mark ye ! the New
South Wales Parliament once in a sublime
rage of occult forgetfulness presented the
astral phantom of a man “ that had been ”
with £lO,OOO, in memoriam of his past
services to the State.
* * *
New South Wales has just enfranchised
the soldier—the non-individual item whose
sole right is a right to do as he is told ; the
trigger-pulling machine who may to-morrow
be ordered to shoot down the people who
pay his wages, on that occasion when they
demand a little more money themselves
wherewith to pay wages—to soldiers, police-
men and judges, ay, and hangmen; for
under a democratic and representative sys-
tem the citizen is compelled to buy the rope
which helps him into another, and perhaps a
better, world. Many a man who speaks
loudly to-day anent a pauper-vote will in a
few years be consigned to that benevolent
asylum whose rise and progress is one of the
glories of our glorious land. No matter !
The pauper is out of favour, and the
Pharaoh of party who knew and recognised
him once now knows him no more for ever,
Mr. Garvan has disowned him, and Mr.
Reid alludes to his advocacy of an asylum
vote as a sportive incident of infinite jest.

In a few weeks it is just possible that Sir
Henry Parkes will be “ placated ” out of
the public Treasury for his relinquishment
of the various things which he was power-
less to control. His position, in such a
case, will be absolutely analogous to that of
a pensioner at Liverpool Asylum, at which
the partial services of one doctor, enjoying
private practice, are distributed among 900
men. Will the Parliament of the province
put him on a political shelf thercfoi’e, and
deprive him of all power to write, vote,
and speak in any political sense whatsoever?
Sir John Robertson was a political some-
body up to the day of his death, although he
had accepted the alms of the nation.
W herefore, then, should the pauper be dis-
franchised? Say he is old, feeble and
outworn. Good ! Place the franchise
on a mentally-competitive basis, and
score every name whose owner cannot
answer certain easy questions in that
science of politics to which Parkes has failed
all his life to give one satisfactory solu-
tion. In the first instance, compel every
member of the Legislative Council to show
cause why he should not be disfranchised on
the ground of mental incapacity. This
scheme may not be possible, but it is logical 1
* # *
An empty pocket is the worst of crimes,
and every man possessing, or expecting to
possess, money-power (which in New South
Wales is, unfortunately, political power also)
is puzzled to know why the pauper should
have a vote. The pauper has forfeited his
vote,, say they ;heis a State pensioner. Is
a Judge not a State pensioner—in the sense-
of having his daily bread assured by the
State beyond the possibility of competition
or a soldier, or a policeman, or a civil
servant ? The inmate of the Benevolent
Asylum has gone down at the end of a fight
in which one of the conditions of struggle
was free competition. The Civil servant^is
protected from this. He serves at a stated
wage, with the prospect of a progressive
rise, and when he is superannuated he walks
out of his office a State pensioner —with a
vote. The Civil Service is a national institu-
tion. True, but it belongs to us, and as
only a limited number of us can serve as
Civil servants, with the prospect of a pension
and the accompanying retention of the
franchise, others of us are compelled at
our life’s decline to have recourse to the
Benevolent Asylum—for the effort to sup-
port the Civil Service is bound to bear
heavily on some shoulders—and we have a
right to claim admission ; for we pay for
benevolent agylums while we are able to
pay. They belong to us, as citizens of a
free and freely-taxed nation, as much as do
the pictures in the National Gallery, and the
inmate of the benevolent asylum is no more
a State pauper than the Civil Service pen-
sioner is a State pauper.
* # #
Pauperism is, by the attempt to disfran-
chise it, placed by the New South Wales
Parliament on a level with lunacy and crime.
If every “ man ” is to have a vote make not
the test of manhood a property qualification.
The newly-enfranchised soldier is a State-
paid machine doing certain work for which,
if he serves long enough, ho will ultimately
receive a pension. Wherein does he differ,
then, from the citizen whose life has been
spent in supporting the machinery of State
amid a severe environment of free compe-
tition, and who, failing at last, receives also
a pension—a meed of assurance for the
future for the efforts of the past ? We are
sorry that the Labour-party lias seen lit to
abandon their stand in regard to the pauper
franchise. It was just; it was logical. The
only reason possible to be urged against the
clause was that of feeble-mindeduess ; but
how absurd this is ! A man is not necessarily
feeble-minded because he is poor. We would
never deprive a wealthy man of the franchise
on such a ground. We seldom deprive a
wealthy man of the right to bequeath pro-
perty (in the case of the members of the
Legislative Council, to make laws) merely
because he is feeble-minded.
* * *
Lot us be honest. The objection to the
enfranchisement of the paupers is a money
objection, and nothing else ; and all objec-
tions to the “One-man-one-vote” principle
are likewise money objections. They are all
simply successive attempts to destroy the
integrity of the measure. “ Would you give
the franchise to soldiers, to prisoners, to
policemen, to paupers ?” Pshaw ! what do
all such queries amount to ? We would
confer the franchise upon all men ; “ One-
man-one-voto ” to every person capable of
using it, the right to the exercise of such fran-
chise being voided only by lunacy or proven
crime. All the exceptions we have heard
raised are ridiculous, because they involve
a discussion on each occasion as to what we
mean by “a man ! ” The Bulletin has
supported the One-man-one-vote principle in
its entirety and in its integrity in the past,
and it intends to support it consistently in
the future within the fixed definitiveness of
the English word “ man," which includes
we have reason to believe—“pauper.” Why
there should be anything ludicrous about a
pauper exercising the franchise we are unable
to surmise. To us a “ pauper ”is simply a
“man” who has paid his share in the past
to the institutions of his country, and who,
when he has been worsted in the struggle for
existence, has a right to boldly walk up to
the front-door of the Benevolent Asylum and
to demand admission in the name of his mis-
fortunes, without forfeiting the right to vote,
or any other right which appertains to him
as a “ man” and a citizen.
Twopence an Hour.
The scheme for the introduction of cheap
Italian labour into Queensland is prospering.
The first shipment of workers has either already
landed or is close at hand, and an indefinite
number of further shipments are coming close
behind. The Italian Government has bestowed
its blessing on the project, for Italy is living
on the two horns of a dilemma, and there are
many dangerous elements in that country, or
elements that are likely to become dangerous,
which the men in authority would gladly give
away to any nation that will take them. The
tremendous effort to make Italy a Great Power,
whereas Providence intended her for a' very
small one, has loaded the country with taxes,
until the Italian landholder, in many cases,
simply abandons the land which has become a
dead loss on his hands, and leaves it to the
Crown, or the foxes, or the kites and crows, or
to anyone who wants to take a ruinous contract
and die over it. The frantic desire to make the
modern Italian look like the resurrected
Roman, and to scream loudly in the councils of
Europe, has burdened the nation with a huge
army that never won a battle, and a ponderous
navy that only once went into action and then
ran away. There are public buildings of
marble scattered all over the peninsula, and
splendid highways have been opened up,
and fortifications of a stupendous order are
everywhere, and new railways have been con-
structed in all directions, and the unshod
Italian taxpayer meanwhile roosts in a kennel
with the dogs and the goats. The Government
endeavours to gild the mud, and to fresco the
filth and the vermin, and it has put a
varnish over the ignorance and the leprosy and
the sores and plague-spots of this foul and
rotten land, where all the nation is famishing in
order that the kingdom may grow palaces.
Italy has invented new and horrible diseases
born of the strange and loathsome food on which
the peasantry eke out a miserable subsistence,
and when the Italian leper is in the last stages
of his complaint he can always get on the lee
side of a pompous cathedral that cost half-a-
million pounds to erect, and there die comfort-
ably. There are mysterious plagues always
floating about the slums of the southern cities,
and unspeakable ignorance is everywhere, and
every third man is either a soldier or a priest or
a tax-gatherer, and the murder-rate is the high-
est in the world, and everywhere there are gold
images and dead goats, and silver, and marble,
and festering garbage, and nakedness, and mud-
hovels, and wretchedness that is past all possi-
bility of expression.
* # *
Therefore, it has occurred to the Queensland
capitalist, and to the Coalition which is his
prophet, that the hog-like illiteracy, the
poverty, the slavishness, and the strange
diseases of Italy are matters that may be turned
into sources of great profit. The object of the
Queensland planter is, first of all, to get cheap
labour, and the Italian is cheap—there are few
cheaper men on earth than the hungry, sun-
blackened peasant of Naples or Tuscany, or the
agriculturist who lives on brown crusts and
fruit among the Apennines. Then the im-
ported labourer must be industrious, and
the Italian, who labours night and day
to support that bloated armament which
always bolts on the day of battle, and that
royal family which is just a shade more moral
than the Ptolemies, inasmuch as it does
actually draw the line at the intermarriage of
brothers and sisters,- though it draws it
nowhere else—fills the bill through sheer force
of necessity. And lastly, the Italian is par-
ticularly suited to the situation by reason of an
ignorance which is within an ace of that of the
camel or the hyena; and, therefore, he freely
signs a contract by which he binds himself
to years oi servitude, at infinitesimal wages,
long hours, the food of a hog, and the privilege
of sleeping in any hole or hovel which may
come handy. The consignments of Romans and
Piedmontese who are now en route for Australia
are pledged to work for a long term at the rate
of 12 hours per day for a cash remuneration of
12s. per week —or exactly twopence per hour.
During the term of his engagement the
imported chattel will be an abject slave in the
most slavish sense of the term. If he leaves
his work he can be put in gaol for breach of
contract. If he absents himself in order to
appeal to the law—provided there is any law
within walking-distance against the pro-
ceedings of his master he can be gaoled
for quitting his legal employment contrary
to the Act of Ceorge IV. or some
similar individual. The civil law can only
be appealed to within certain hours, and a
degraded Italian who works from dawn till
after sunset must necessarily break the law by
leaving his employment before he can appeal
against anybody else’s breach of law. In his
ignorance of the manners, language and
customs of the country, he will be practically
at the mercy of his boss and patron, and, in
short, he will be so nearly a duplicate of the
old Louisiana nigger that the difference between
the two will not be worth swearing at.
* # #
The new Italian will not become in any sense
or by any possibility an Australian. Un-
less the scheme of wholesale immigration is
cut short by violence there will present!}' groAV
up in the North a great Italian community
with its own language, manners and customs,
its own squalor, ignorance, superstition, and
other disadvantages. It will be located in
remote regions where education is scarce, and
the dirty young Italian will simply grow up to
be the image and reproduction of the dirty old
Italian who went before him. There will be no
progress in a knowledge of the decencies or
comforts of life ; progress of this kind is utterly
incompatible with extreme poverty, and the
family that lives in a hovel amid a tropical
swamp on an income of 12s. a week never does
progress. When each batch of labourers get to
the end of their term of servitude they will
probably move South, and form a little squalid
Italy of their own in the outlying parts
of the coastal cities. They are not likely to
re-engage themselves for a further term on the
same unspeakable terms as before, for nothing
short of absolute mental incapacity can prevent
them acquiring some knowledge of the vast-
ness of the swindle by which they were in-
duced to work for 12 hours a day and
twopence an hour, in a land where Is. per hour
is regarded as a reasonable wage. Their
masters are not likely to re-engage them on
equitable terms, because, so long as the
importation of indented serfs is permitted
by law, and so long as Russia, Italy,
Portugal, China, India, and similar lands can
supply cheap pauper labour in indefinite
quantities, he can always find new workers to
grovel in his cane-fields at twopence per hour,
and ask no questions. And the Italian cannot
be shunted home again against his will merely
because his owner is done with him ; he is the
tattered representative of a nation which
commands some 2,000,000 armed men, and a
huge ironclad fleet, and behind it is the force
and the moral influence of the great Triple
Alliance, which is a power that the British
empire cannot disregard. Therefore, if the
Italian desires to stay he probably will do so,
and the chances are that he will desire to stay,
for no poor man in his senses ever wants to go
back to Italy. And being in a state of chronic
insurrection against the 12 hours a day and the
12s. a week, his ambition will probably be
to work only 10 hours a day and earn 245.
a week. Therefore, the native Queenslander
must either, through pressure of competition,
come down to the Italian standard, and
qualify himself for doing so by acquiring
the Italian’s dirt and ignorance, and the
dull animal contentment which enables him
to enjoy his dirt and his ignorance—or
else he must elevate him, by some violent pro-
cess, to the level of the country, and then he
must somehow find employment for him to
prevent him sinking again, through pressure of
poverty, after he is elevated. As Queensland
is already reduced to the lowest stage of misery
through trade depression, want of employment,
and the competition of incessant hordes of mis-
cellaneous cheap immigrants, imported at the
nation’s expense by the infamous Coalition, the
latter possibility is exceedingly remote. And,
even granting that it could be accomplished,
there could be no end to the process. Half
Europe and Asia is ready to pour into Aus-
tralia by contract, even on the terms offered by
the Queensland planters, and the attempt to
elevate these hordes to the industrial standard
of the country is just the same as attempting
to pump a vessel dry with the whole Pacific
ocean coming through the bottom.
* * #
The Italian, however, would have other uses
besides his ostensible employment of hoeing
sugar-cane in a sultry land at twopence per
hour. At the present time the Coalition is
busily engaged in establishing itself as a
despotism of one fat man and one thin one, by
the simple process of striking off the roll nearly
everybody who can’t be relied upon to vote the
Coalition ticket at next election. If the experi-
ment is successful the next Parliament will con-
sist solely of a bigoted assortment of mono-
polists and landlords whose one business
will be to shore up the interests of Property.
Then, having got in by “faking” the electoral
rolls by ingenious but iqiquitous means within
the law, they will probably abolish man-
hood suffrage by formal process of law, so as to
save the necessity for such dangerous experi-
ments in the future, and establish the suffrage
on a solid property basis, and altogether extin-
guish the working-man as a political factor.
This is assuredly what the Coalition will do if
circumstances are favourable, and its courage
holds out—it possesses all the unscrupulousness
and all the ruffianism which are essential for
the work, but its pluck and its mental capacity
are doubtful. But if this scheme should fall
through, and the existing suffrage continues in
force, the imported Italian will prove a valu-


.j-jle force in the political world. He can be
shunted on the roll wholesale ; he will be guilt-
less of any knowledge of the English language ;
a iid he will know absolutely nothing of any
local matters beyond his 12 hours per diem and
pis 12s. a week. He is not likely to learn
English, because he will live in a colony of his
oWU countrymen ; and he is certain not to learn
politics, for newspapers will be to him an un-
intelligible thing, and political propagandists—
except those of the variety approved by his
p oS s and owner —will be warned otF under the
law of trespass. Therefore, the Italian serf
will be eminently fitted to give a block vote in
t l, e interests of Property. He will probably
„ e t a holiday and a choice drunk as an induce-
ment to vote as his proprietor tells him to ;
and as an election will be a pleasant break in
pPe dire and horrible monotony of hoeing sugar-
cane for 72 hours a week, he will be an emi-
nently reliable voter, and a solid influence in
shaping the future destinies of Queensland.
* * #
The Italian immigrant —if he is permitted to
increase and multiply at the pleasure of the
Coalition —will supply an interesting problem
for the future. In the first place, he will doubt-
less introduce those quaint and curious secret
societies which have done so much to help along
the rate of mortality in Italy, and which have
been transplanted with so much success to the
shores of the Gulf of Mexico. For wherever a
few Italians are gathered together there a secret
society will be found which exists for purposes
of blackmail, and for the supply of corpses to
the local cemetery. It sends out its anonymous
ultimatum to everybody who has offended or in-
iuredanltalian, and if the ultimatum isofnoavail
it is followed up by prompt assassination.
—if it will bear transplantation—the com-
jjjo 1 pauper will doubtless bring with him the
pellagra —tlirrt curious Italian leprosy of which
he has the copyright, and which is a complaint
eminently fitted for use in the far North. And
along with it he will fetch along his great and
comprehensive dislike to all forms of progress,
his venerable and hoary superstitions, and that
valuable military tendency which leads him—
when his country is in peril—to go into battle
whooping a little in the rear, and to come out
of it yelling a little in front. Furthermore, he
will doubtless bring out one or two other
characteristics unnecessary to describe.
# # #
The Bulletin views this new immigrant
from a purely Australian —in other words, from
a purely selfish—standpoint. Everybody in
Australia and everybody elsewhere views him
and every other immigrant from exactly the
same standpoint, but very few are prepared to
admit the fact —which makes all the difference.
The Italian in his own land is a wretched, im-
poverished being, who is loaded down with
military pomp, and fast dying of hunger in
order that his Government may cover the land
With gigantic fortifications ancf own the largest
army—in proportion to population —that the
earth has ever seen. Even a life on the
Queensland plantations might possibly be a
glimpse of Paradise to many a peasant from the
sun-blasted Campagna or the plains of Lombardy,
and if this country refuses him a refuge, the
curse will be loud and long in the Christian
land of England, and many British newspapers
will wail over the selfishness of the Australian
nation. But all over the world every sym-
pathetic nation desires to aid the poor and the
oppressed in the same old way, by sending
them to be a nuisance and a burden to some
other nation, and every nation weeps tears of
desolation when the other nation declines to
take them in. The Italian immigrant will
make wages lower and the struggle of life
harder for the Australian ; and he may easily
become a serious danger to political freedom,
and, therefore, the Australian people will pre-
sently class him with the Chinaman and the
rabbit-pest, and act accordingly. There is
doubtless something inhuman in this policy,
but there is nothing in it more inhuman than
usual; every nation and every Government
looks after itself alone, and it is for that pur-
pose only that they exist. This is the one
fixed principle that is recognised everywhere on
earth, but from force of ancient habit it is con-
sidered a commendable thing to snuffle and
enter a protest when any other State puts the
principle into practice ; and when the State
that entered the protest does the same thing in
its turn, then the other State snuffles instead ;
and thus matters are made about square all
round. Only, as this ancient formula is grow-
ing very wearisome, the sympathetic aspect of
the case has been omitted in this article. The
Englishman, when he extends the hand of
friendship to any down-trodden foreigner,
generally bids him go to Australia and be at
rest. If the Australian briefly states that he
hasn’t time to care whether any particular
individual—save himself—is at rest or not, the
fact may not look so well, but it comes to the
same thing in the end.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Scream.
The following letter has arrived at this
office:—
Editor Bulletin.—Sir, —I am instructed by the Central
Committee of the Labour Electoral League of N.S.W. to
take the opportunity to deny the unwarrantable and
untruthful assertions contained in article published in
The Bulletin of the 21st November. From your remarks
pu that occasion it would appear that you are lamentably
ignorant of the objects of this labour organisation. The
fact should have been clearly apparent to you that, in the
'ery inception of these leagues, we distinctly refused to
know or entertain any party views, which had operated
'n the past to divide and render futile the efforts of the
Workers of this community iu the direction of legislative
reforms. The unwarrantable assumption you make iu
stating, in effect, that this labour organisation is literally
‘bossed” by Single-tax potentates, who flit about from
branch to branch, carrying a floating majority with
them, is such a manifest perversion that it needs little
’ n °re than a bare denial, and to draw your attention to
°ur platform and to express the desire, that as a brain-
worker you will fall into line with your more-lowly
co-workers, and then you would find your mind dis-
■llusioniaed-of the error you have given expression and
Publicity to. For yoft would then be aware of the fact
that most of our branch leagues have stringent hy-laws
m actual operation, which render it practically impossible
for any members who may favour any distinct outside
party to act in the manner you have asserted. In closing
I would point out that this attempt, on your part, to
unrig discredit mid disrepute upon this young, hut
vigorous organisation is, unwittingly perhaps, designed
to show to the workers, to the true democracy of tins
colony, that you have become alien to the democratic
instincts which have actuated you in the past, and the
blow you have blindly aimed at the workers’-party win
rebound with increased force upon the author of this
unmerited slander.— l am, yours, Will Masto.v, I rcss
Secretary, O.C.L.E.L. of N.S.W.
The Bulletin has several things to mention in
regard to this excited epistle. (1.) It knows
exactly what are, or should be, the “objects
of this labour organisation.” As it advocated
these objects, and a lot more, for ton years
before the organisation Started, and is still
advocating them, and will advocate them as
long as it lives, it ought to know them. (2.)
This paper didn’t say that the said organisation
“ entertained any party views it said that
the Single-taxers entertained certain views, and
wanted to use the Labour Party to carry them
out, which is perfectly true —vide the recent
declarations of Single-tax Cotton, M.L.A. (3.)
It didn’t want the organisation to entertain
party views; that was why itobjected to it voting
the Foreign-trade ticket in consideration of an
alleged One- man- one- vote Bill, and then
throwing out Parkes (whom The Bulletin
has consistently opposed) and throwing away
the price of all its exertions. (4.) The
Bulletin didn’t say that the Labour Electoral
League is “bossed” by Single-taxers ; it
simply said that the latter individuals wanted
to boss it ; if Mr. Maston wanted to be a
Chinese gentleman, that doesn’t necessarily
imply that h.e is one. Therefore (5) the
League’s “bare denial” amounts to absolutely
nothing ; if the League sent along its denial in a
matter that solely concerned its own views, wo
would accept it cheerfully, but when one set of
men “denies” that another set of men enter-
tain certain unspoken aspirations, they are
denying more than they can be responsible for.
(6.) The League's “ stringent bye-laws ” have
nothing to do with the case ; 27,000 bye-laws
wouldn’t hinder the Single-tax people trying to
boss the League, and that is all The Bulletin
asserted. (7.) The Bulletin denies the
alleged “attempt” to “bring discredit and
disrepute ” on the Labour Electoral League;
its remarks were directed against the Single-
Tax-cnm-Foreign-Trade crowd, and unless Mr.
Maston is himself one of that crowd, and is
using the Labour Party as a tool, he has no
more cause to get in an ignorant frenzy over it
than has the Geographical Society, or the
Dorcas meeting, or the Cat-show committee.
(8.) The Bulletin ends by flatly contradicting
every other assertion in Mr. Maston’s letter
except the date and the signature, and by
remarking that it is perfectly indifferent to
both applause and denunciation —especially to
denunciation of the cant-democratic order, such
as is contained in the concluding paragraph of
Mr. Maston’s letter. Such figures of speech
as “ a blow rebounding .with increased force,”
are outrages on the laws of gravitation.
The Old Kiama Gliost.
The proposed establishment of a Protectionist-
policy in N.S.W. has struck terror and dismay
into the bloodless hearts of the Freetraders ;
and, as a last resource, the recognised leaders
of that faction are attempting to set the com-
munity by the ears. Then forlorn hope is
evidently to rekindle the fires of sectarianism,
and, with the aid of the Yellow Pup and the
plural vote, to block the march of Protection.
As the Evening News reserves its anti-
democratic views for its “society” paper, so
the Herald prints its genuine political opinions
in its evening offshoot, the Echo. The Herald
hasn’t the moral courage to raise the cry of
“ the Priest in Politics” in its own columns ;
but its proprietary hasn’t the slightest com-
punction in playing upon the religious pre-
judices of the “unco guid ” through the
medium of the Echo, as witness the following
extracts from that paper :
Brazil finds that the meddling of clericals in State
matters is intolerable and returns his passports to the
papal Nuncio. The Priest in politics again ! Wednesday.
The Jesuit in politics, and how he works, the labouring
classes in New South Wales will see when their delegates
record their votes on Mr. Reid's motion \ —Thursday.
Mr. BARTON has not much to say about “ the holy cause
of Federation.” It is now the holy cause of Protection
which has the blessings of the Church and Mr. Barton's
special attention. — Friday.
“ Gentlemen, I’m not a talker; 1 111 a doer is a
favourite expression of W. O. Grace in his after-dinner
speeches. Mr. Slattery, M.L.A,, might say the same:
jiis voice is seldom heard nowadays, hut he is working all
the time—“ a-doing splendidly,” in fact. Someone has
called Mr. Slattery Mr. Dibrs’ political vade-mecum,
meaning thereby, we presume, that Mr. Slattery makes
the bombshells and Mr. Dibrs fires them. This is cruel.—
Saturday,
In this odious shooting-behind-tlie-hedge busi-
ness, the Herald proprietary are cordially
joined by the arch-patron of bigotry and sec-
tarianism, the Great I Am himself. Parkes,
the originator of class-legislation in New South
Wales- the advocate of the Treason Felony
Act !—must choose Kiama —the birthplace of
his Kiama Ghost—as a platform from which to
pander to the petty prejudices of the L.O.L.
brigade—to Neild’s 100,000 class electors.
Speaking on the subject of Federation, be
basely insinuated to the Protestant portion of
the community that the federal movement is
opposed chiefly by the Roman Catholics
In endeavouring to bring this matter to some issue he
had two classes of difficulties lo encounter. There were
those who could not rise to so great a measure, and others
who were opposed to him from motives of party animosity
towards himself. They were disposed to array themselves
in hostility to anything that would increase his influence.
The class he referred to would not forget him for passing
the Public Schools Act of 1806.
Is Parkes plotting to snatch the leadership of
the Freetraders from Reid, force a dissolution,
ami stump the province on Freetrade, Federa-
tion and Fenianism ?
-
To allay the financial panic existent in Mel-
bourne, a special measure was rushed through
both Houses of the Victorian Parliament, just
when public alarm was at its acutest stage.
The Bill was framed to prevent a Judge from
ordering the compulsory liquidation of any
company that has undertaken voluntary
liquidation except at the request of the
creditors—one-third both as to number and
value. This is a most arguable course to take, and
the action was only taken because Capital teas
harassed. Now, had Labour been suffering from
any equally acute strain, let it be asked if any
Parliament would have strained its loins to
rush through any remedial Bill in one day ?
No, nor in one week, nor one month, nor one
year. Masses may choke, starve, be trampled
underfoot, and “ it is all right.” “ Times will
right themselves,” &c., &c. But let Capital get
a sore toe, or a whitlow on its little finger, and
Creation reverberates its bowlings, and—
Parliament cures the ill in one act.
The “run ” on the various Melbourne building
societies perhaps dates from the day when the
Age sent a sympathetic interviewer to wait
upon Matthias Larkin. Depositors were then
seized by a fear that embezzlement would come
to be regarded as a short cut to the Temple of
Fame. A flood of “ Premier Association case ”
recollections rushed into their harassed minds,
and. taking one thing with another, they
decided to withdraw their cash before any more
secretaries and directors had attempted to win
martyrs’ crowns. The Age, it is satisfactory to
find, has now thrown Matthias over as a bad
job, and prints painful particulars of his moral
“trip” in comparatively cold blood. But
nobody can doubt that the effect of “ our special
reporter’s ” interview, coming after the anti-
Templeton crusade of a year ago, was to set
folks wondering whether frauds on building-
societies had been struck off the list of legal
offences. And although they still had every
confidence in the integrity, &c., of everybody,
there was no getting away from the fact that a
secretary who can get five years' when he goes
wrong is more trustworthy than the gentleman
who can loot the treasury with impunity.
Wherefore depositors rushed in for their hard-
earned savings and payment was promptly—
Suspended.
One of the stock arguments against the See
tariff—which, as it can hardly be called a
scientific Protectionist one, The Bulletin
does not uphold in every item —is that, while
the New South Wales Treasurer only
hopes to get £75,000 from the imposts on what
lie styles “ luxuries,” he estimates receiving
five or six times as much from “ the taxes
which the poor people must pay.” Even
Parkes thought this sort of humbug good
enough for Kiama. Give these people the
benefit of their premises and follow the facts:—-
Luxuries produce £75,000; the other taxes,
say, even as much as £500,000, which is reck-
lessly overdoing it. Who pay the £75,000 ? The
well-to-do. Who pay the half-million ? The
poor and the w'ell-to-do. The well-to-do may
be set down at one-twentieth of the population,
and the poor at nineteen-twentieths. Now, the
whole twenty-twentieths find the £500,000 —
say, roughly, a million souls at 10s. per head.
But only olie-twentieth pay the £75,000, or
50,000 souls at 80s. per head. These' 50,000
have already paid 10s. per head with the rest ;
so their whack to the revenue is £2 per head.
The figures, on the basis taken, would be
950,000 poor at 10 s. per head .. £475,000
50,000 well-to-do at £2 per head 100,000
Total £575,000
Thus, although the aggregate poor total up
more than the aggregate rich, the individual
poor man only pays one-fourth the taxes of the
individual rich.
In the recent Colston murder-case at Mel-
bourne, counsel for the defence took up a per-
fectly rational position, viz. : the existence of
brain-disease, which all the medical witnesses
admitted, though differing in detail, and the
impulse which marked that disease was
acknowledged by all. But the Judge con-
tinually put forward the grotesquely illogical
right and wrong theory—he told the jury that
the homicide himself said he knew when he
killed his victims that he was doing wrong, and
he remarked that there could be no better
proof of a man’s condition than his own state-
ment. In another Victorian case the other day
there occurred a peculiar incident bearing
strongly on the arguments in the Colston case.
Mrs. Scarsbrook, of Richmond, who poisoned
herself and three children (one or more of the
latter fatally) in a fit of puerperal madness,
said she knew at the time she was doing wrong,
and meant to do it, but she could not help it—
she “had to do it.” This knowledge of hers
was brought out prominently at her trial for
murder and much dwelt upon ; counsel for the
defence logically asked the jury to find the
woman sane and guilty or not guilty at all.
But the Judge— Higinbotham, C.J.—saw the
position, and told the jury that it was for them
to say whether, when she made the statement —
which she repeated to several persons, including
the doctors—she knew what she was saying ?
Thus do Judges save themselves from the
logical outcome of their present irrational
theory that a prisoner is necessarily morally
and legally responsible for his or her actions
whenever he or she knows the difference between
right and wrong.
We condense from a daily newspaper report; —
John Maskall, a decent-looking young fellow against
whom the police know nothing, was staying at a Sydney
hotel, and one morning left his room partially nude to go
to the bath. While in the passage leading bath-wards he
heard on the stairs what he took to be feminine footsteps
and ran into the first room—which happened to bethatof
the landlord. As fate would have it, the footsteps were
those of the landlady, and when Maskall found her
entering the room he slipped under the bed to await her
departure. She saw his feet and screamed, whereupon
he arose and caught hold of the lady’s wrist lightly, tried
to explain, implored her not to make such a noise, and
putting her aside hastened back to his room. The police
were sent for, Maskall was given in charge for being
illegally in the room—but the police-magistrate (after
ascertaining that accused had a towel with him) kindly
altered the charge to “ assault!” and allotted prisoner
three months hard labour.
Now, the question as to the towel clearly
showed that doubt existed in the magistrate’s
mind. May nob a great injustice have been
here done to a modest young man ? The Bul-
letin urges upon the Minister of Justice that
any jury would have given Maskall the benefit
of the doubt.
Dear Bulletin, —After all, the Federal Council
(discarded but still existent) ottered the most
natural mode of growth to the Federal idea.
Australian Federation may be likened to an
economic marriage of States, and no marriage
can hope to result in lasting happiness that is
suddenly forced upon hitherto strangers with
mutual differentiations and antipathies. The
rrf/ime of the Federal Council represented the
precautionary period of experimental courtship,
during which the high contracting parties to
the final ceremony acquire the necessary give-
and-take knowledge of each other’s idiosyn-
cracies. Affinities common to each formed the
first points of friendly contact, and with the
deepening intimacy of intercolonial statesmen
fresh tentacles of union were only a question of
time. The Federal Council promised an easy
process of development, a step-by-step ascent to
the summit of perfect union. The wounded pique
of the vain old matchmaker, Parkes, who wanted
to hastily marry the parties willy-nilly, was the
chief factor in retarding the expansion of the
Federal Council idea and in limiting the useful-
ness of that body. Because Parkes had not
been conspicuous in its first hooray, he em-
ployed all his political influence and cunning to
stunt its growth and to hinder its recognition
by the mother-colony. His subsequent vain-
glorious failure to model out a Federation from
the clay of his own feet carries with it his suffi-
cient punishment. Now that the Parkes
scheme is laid upon the shelf, the Federal
Council may be utilised with beneficial, prac-
tical results.—H. C.
In connection with the recent passing of about
£3OO worth of Bank of Adelaide forged £1 notes,
that institution advertised loftily that it would
feel obliged if the victimised holders would visit
the bank with their loathsome debentures, in
which case the institution would be so good
as to cancel those which were spurious and re-
initial those which might turn out good. The
dailies wherein this impudent manifesto occurs
cap the affair by observing that anyone holding
a bogus note had better be very careful and
comply with the bank’s request, otherwise he
or she may incur the liability of “uttering”
should the note get into circulation. Now,
what we have to say on this subject is short,
but unmistakeable. The class of people “had ”
in this paltry swindle consists mainly of small
tradesmen, and it is bad enough for these to
have to drop even 205., without having to leave
their businesses to favour a supercilious institu-
tion whose only fear is" lest some of its own
clerks should happen to cash forgeries. Divid-
ing the loss of £3OO among the bank’s share-
holders, the yearly dividend would be affected
to no more than a fractional extent, and, as it
must have been through the bank’s fault that
the forgeries were rendered achievable, it is
clear that, both as a matter of policy and equity,
the bank should stand the racket and give a
golden sovereign in exchange for the miserable
pieces of paper which hona fide citizens have
cashed. A remedy for preventing similar mis-
chances in future is obvious : Decline to accept
notes of any find from anyone, and then how
will the associated pawnbrokers feel? When
Ave get a State Bank it will probably be the
rule that the community at large shall suffer
the losses of those individuals who may happen
to be deceived by occasional forgeries, and it
will be the duty of those who pay the piper to
detect and punish the criminals, and not as it
is now, i.efi the duty of the victimised trades-
man. To this end let us quick march.
Sir William M'Gregor, the autocrat of the
missionary-haunted, snuffle-burdened, priest-
infested land of New Guinea, has issued anew
law, whereby any native guilty of adultery
shall be imprisoned for six months, and his
female accomplice for three. Presumably he has
done this at the instance of the white-chokered
crowd of wild preachers who' so horribly per-
vade the island—nobody but a preacher would
get down to such an act of tyranny. For, in
the first place, there is no particular or well-
defined marriage-law or custom in the country,
therefore the M'Gregor can’t tell with any
certainty what is immorality and what is
ordinary matrimony. Asa natural conse-
quence, when the naked Romeo gets married,
it is three chances to one that a huge, raw
Presbyterian dressed hi a little passing authority
will straightway put him and his wife
in gaol through sheer ignorance. Secondly,
there is no such law in Great Britain ;
the self-governing Englishman reserves to him-
self the right to commit adultery without
incurring any criminal penalty, and it is a mean,
low proceeding for him to pile up on a feeble
little nigger the burden of a code of morality
which he won’t carry himself. The Englishman
governs the New Guinea nigger, and preaches
and prays at him, and professes to be a superior
being generally, and then he demands that this
same despised heathen shall be better than he is
himself, or else go to gaol. It is a despicable
and wormy proceeding all round, and the cast-
iron saint who first conceived the idea—the
black-coated, black-hatted person with the holy
smile—should be turned out naked in a primeval
forest, if only to see how moral he could be
when he also was reduced to first principles.
The attention of the present New South Wales
Minister of Justice is directed to the case of
Thomas Suffield, convicted at last Maitland
Assizes of a criminal assault upon a woman
named Ann Chambers, a domestic in the em-
ploy of Mr. Thos. Croudace, J.P., and sen-
tenced to ten years’ penal servitude. The
evidence was extremely weak, and the discre-
pancies between the statements made by prosecu-
trix at the Police Court and at the sessions were
glaring. The accused, a young man of previously
irreproachable character, set up a strong alibi.
There was no circumstantial evidence of the
alleged deed found upon him, and his time was
so well accounted for that the verdict was irre-
concileable with common sense. The girl first
imputed her injuries to a ferocious bull of Mr.-
Croudace’s, which subsequently hurt another
woman, who received compensation, the bull
then being destroyed. The evidence was as
weak as the judicial summing-up was unfair.
The very advantages which nature had bestowed
upon Suffield were turned to his prejudice
and ruin by the Judge, who suggested the
case of Colonel Valentine Baker to the minds
of the jury in proof that good looks, education,
and intelligence did not necessarily keep any
man from crime.

8-16 Macquarie-street North, Sydney, Dec. 9,1891,
My Dear. Moorauinda,—
The day was hot and moist and windy when the ’Ome
cricketers first appeared at Sydney Association Ground.
Dr. Grace stood out as the largest, baggiest hero of the
troupe, and as he plodded heavily along with his hairy
arms folded across his chest, he made me think vaguely
of the “belligerent hippopotami” Mr. Stanley talks
about. Individualised, the visiting team seemed to con-
sist, as usual, of the athletic young man with no percep-
tible forehead—and the game he played was doubtless
heavenly' cricket full of thrill and craft and genius, but,
after all, when the brightly r -clad performers had moved
one to momentary' enthusiasm as they' strode to the wicket,
little remained but stifled yawning fits to keep the lay'
observer going.
As play did not begin until three-quarters of an hour
late, owing to a dispute over the umpiring, dresses and
people were easily sorted out. Among the frocked con-
tingent Mrs. (Dr.) Grace wore a dark blue dress, figured
in white, small black bonnet; Mrs. Victor Cohen, grey
frieze with invisible rainbow check of blue and pink,
trimmed with revers of garnet silk, black bonnet. White
muslin, with a little red dot, trimmed with red muslin
embroidery, was nice until you got to her hat, which
appeared to have been boiled ; a neat pale-grey frock was
nicely contrasted with a scarlet gamp, and the pink roses
in the hat were quite in taste according to latest styles,
but the artistic eye was pained. The most artful
combination was a terra-cotta cloth topped by a fawn
straw hat crowded with poppies.
Numbers of Australians will regret the death (in
America, from Bright’s disease) of Mr. G. W. Griffin, U.S.
Consul at Sydney for many years, though the cabled
news was no shock to his near friends, as the Counsel
avowedly' went home to the Stales in. order to die in his
native land. It must be a gruesome, dreary' business—
ploughing drearily over the desolate seas which seem to
lap hungrily for your bones as the ship races against
death to port, and Consul Griffin hated what was grue-
some or dreary. The brightest recollection I have of him
was at a ball, sailing up the room with a lady on cither
arm—which was not strange, only one lady looked as
pleased and flattered as the other, which was marvellous.
Any theoretical ladies’-man who underrates this little
tribute to the social qualities of Gilderoy Wells Griffin
will greatly appreciate it if he trots out two ladies before
passing his opinion.
It is a dreadful task to have to write in an outwardly
calm manner that Australia is going to lose Admiral Pre-
cedence Scott some time next year. He will be in Heaven
—promotion to the rank of Vice-Admiral is Heaven to a
man of his order—on or about September, ’92, and it is
said that Admiral Stephenson is to rush the Orlando
about from Cup to Cup in his stead. Admiral Stephenson
"has been unemployed since his promotion, 14 months
ago, and though this appointment would involve the
passing over of several seniors, Admiral Stephenson is an
excellent officer, and is considered to have strong claims,
not the least of which is his connection with the Prince of
Wales’ household as equerry.” Mr. S. seems to be quite a
shocking example of official favouritism. As a con-
spicuous unemployed, he is sent hurtling over the grey
heads of his snubbed seniors just because he has daw'dled
about Wales’ premises, keeping the flies off a fat sinecure
and perhaps “ obliged his royal master on pressing occa-
sions.” One could almost grow indignant at the way of
the “ appointment,” only it is such a matter of indiffer-
ence who occupies the patchy mansion at Kirribilli Point,
and Mr. Stephenson won’t want for thorns on his roses.
Some people would rather be subordinate all their lives
than have (in the absence of a Government grant for eau-
de-cologne) to live next door to a hide-warehouse.
Talking about Admirals, what does an Admiral do?
Act the frowning Providence to so many jack-tars and
whisk his gold-braided coat-tails round the marble halls
of the retired pork-butcher in the stuccoed suburb. The
rest of the time goes in squabbling over little side-winds
of ceremony and seeing that the flag gets dipped the
proper number of times when he appears any where sud-
denly on the brink of the harbour, and that’s nearly the
sum total of his trying duties. It must be as easy as
breathing to be an Admiral once you’re in. You needn’t
even be a good sailor, for most of the Admirals we become
familiar with in Australia travel per Pullman car when-
ever they have the chance, while the vessel creeps round
the coast and the faithful newspapers report that the
Admiral passed Barrenjoey at 4 p m.
Owing to a vertical drizzle at starting time I missed the
Sydney articled-clerks’ mock-trial, “Boyant v. Merri-
man,” which eventuated at the stepping-heavenward-like
Y.M.C.A. Hall, on 3d Inst., but 1 don’t think I dodged
much fun. The mock-case (boiled down) before the court
«as that the two yachts collided—one went down, and
the man and his best girl, who got ducked, went around
in a damp, fishy state howling for damages. I really don’t
see how the audience could get much thrill over a dreary
worry of that sort, do you ? Perhaps the articled sharks
made the thing snappy and full of “go”—it must have
been as laborious as wheeling a barrow of sand uphill on
a holiday if they did, and it seems a pity they didn’t
sharpen their wits to get a more lively subject. Are
they too bowdlerised to put up a breach-of-promise action
with its myriad larky possibilities? The last theatrical
mock-trial held in Sydney was a B. of P. suit, and great
was the hilarity thereof. George Anson was the blighted
damsel, and you could hear the “court ” laughing on the
other side of the street.
Going to see the Juvenile operatists at the “Criterion,"
In a day and generation when you receive a daily invita-
tion to go and watch the capers of the public-school
Infant gambolling on a platform to raise money to buy
itself a prize at Xmas—the “novelty” doesn’t seem such
a blessed change as it did in the years when children were
publicly seen and not heard. Children’s opera is soothing
in one way. It is lovely to see “Three Little Maids” (it
was “Mikado,” by the way) who really looked as if they
had just come from school. Also, the school-girl chorus,
Each a little bit afraid is, wondering what the world can
be, is not at all aggravating when sung by a fresh-faced
crowd, of small girls, instead of by a horde of ogling,
paint-worn hags, each of whom looks as if she knew
enough to score points off a divorce-lawyer. The“pug-
wuggies ” are dressed correctly, but who on earth paints
their little faces ? Somebody who places them in line
and throws their blushes at them with a trowel, judging
by results. Some of the infants could sing if their voices
weren’t overworked, but their acting bears the imprint of
the stage-manager, and you can almost see it written on
t.ie margin of their part: “ Here you wink the other eye.”
And who would have it otherwise ? The girl of twelve,
who played Yum-Yum to encore business, would make
every woman in the house long to take her home and
spank her as a stern moral duty.
Strictly S.R.O. all over the Association Ground on
Monday afternoon—the last day of Grace—the attend-
ance totalling 10,000. There w'ere bevies of Society
butterflies (they patronise everything English) in Sunday
clothes, all jumping and shrieking like ’Arriet out for a
oliday, as the flannelled figures in the open played to the
gallery. The Y.R.-box in the middle of the Grand-Stand
was well filled and gaped at all the time. The central
cynosure was the very latest “ colonial-experiencer”
Lady Galloway—a plump and amiable aristocrat with a
profile like a China doll, who made her Australian dehiit
in a cream gown with a frisky-looking black hat trimmed
in a profuse way with black feathers, beads and pink
roses. She and Lady Innes (looking charming in a black
gown with bead edgings, neck scarf of heliotrope chiffon
and tiny black bonnet with wreath of purple heath) took
care of the two Jersey children in cream frocks and white
hats and feathers.
Under the cegis of the senior member for somewhere I
got a cosy seat behind what Max O’Rell calls the “spoken
to”atN.S,W. Legislative Assembly the night when the
Treasurer and ex-Treasurer were banging the table and
threatening one another over the Financial Statement. It
was a regular field night, and the House was crowded ;
with a round dozen or so of women behind the Speaker’s
perch—mostly determined-looking ladies in mannish
jackets and shirts, with big solitaires in the wristbands,
who didn’t listen over-intently to the talk, but seemed to
imagine that you achieved Parliamentary savoir faire by
steeping yourself for ever so long in the hot atmosphere
of the Assembly, as in a sort of Turkish bath of Legisla-
tive procedure. Viewing the shapers of N.S.W. political
destiny in their native lair, it becomes evident that Sir
Henry Parkes is the only member who effectively
“dresses” the part and successfully imparts the pic-
turesque into public life. By the way, I don’t think I
ever yet heard a woman say a word against Sir Henry.
“ Why?” As if you didn’t know !
A friend of mine, a politician, tells me that Sir Henry’s
extreme nastiness in the recent South Coast speech, of the
vulgarity of which everyone is talking, was perhaps
partially owing to the mixed character of the brands of
champagne submitted for the inspection of the company
during the afternoon. Another reason was that while
the “Hairy Bismarck”—is not that what the Albury
German called him?—was telling the audience in some-
what affected and almost lachrymose tones what ’e did
hin “ fifty-height ” a man who wanted medical assistance
for his wife entered the packed hall, and, unable to make
his way to the front, called out for “ Doctor Breretonl ”
Sir Henry took the interjector for a Dibbsite and an
enemy, opened upon him the floodgates of abuse, and
called him a “ hidjit ” and a “ hinterrupting brute.”
Almost all professional Sydney, and a lot of mere
private individuals, drifted to the sad sea-shore on 13th
instant, to bang hollow palms at Mr. Alfred Wyburd on
the occasion of the opening of the newly-rebuilt Bondi
Aquarium. After the concert, the shaggy donkey held a
levee on the lawn ; the seals and the people bumping over
the “Switchback” shrieked in concert, and the crowd
surged everywhere.
Landlords should hesitate before letting a house to a
medical man, unless he shows signs of taking root for
ever, because victims who inhabit directly after a doctor
live to bitterly repent of their rashness ! A well-known
Sydney “dashing militaire,” who moved in after a
registrar-and-medico in one, has had dismal proof of the
horrors of the situation, and his real woes may act as
warnings to the house-father who ventures to precipitate
his goods and chattels under the sinister red-lamp
shadowing the bold brass plate. For instance, at
one a.m., as he sank into his beauty-sleep, the friends of
the last horrible suicide would hang on to his bell-handle
and implore him to come down and inspect the gashes;
and their frantic appeals for aid would be interrupted by
the low meanings of the man who had brought round a
compound-fracture in a cab and wanted it examined im-
mediately, and when the badgered house-holder had dis-
tinctly rectified the mistake from an upper-window, and
gone back to bed, a happy father would come streaking
round the corner and bang him up in his capacity as
registrar, and inform the listening street, betweep tattoos,
that the nurse said it weighed nine pounds. Then in the
daytime his drawing-room was mobbed by giggling
servant-girls and heavily-breathing swains who wanted to
“git married” for two-and-six, and this interesting
crowd, going out, would be met by the results of a shriek-
ing tram-accident coming in, and life had no charm for
the registrar-doctor’s successor until he hung out a brass-
plate with his name and titles on it in bold letters. I
could tell you a much better story about the consequences
of taking a house without carefully enquiring as to who
had preceded you, but on second reflection I must decline
to commit it to paper.
Miss Forsythe (daughter of Mr. A. Forsythe, ex-M.L.A.
for South Sydney) was the other day married to Mr. Fred
Thorpe at St. Michael’s, Surry Hills. Mr. Fitzgerald,
M. was best man, and the wedding breakfast was
supplemented by a dance at West’s rooms.
Talking of weddings—three are to take place among the
head-office staff of the A.M.P. Society shortly. On 3rd
instant a presentation of plate was made to Mr. C. Mutton,
who marries a South Sydney bride on 9th instant, and
shows the remaining would-be Benedicts the way to the
altar.
Sydney Liedertafel will burst forth again into wild song
at Centennial Hall, on ICth inst., when Delaney’s
“ Captain Cook ” cantata, and a miscellaneous wind-up,
are to keep the audience awake till ten p.m. Alpress,
Miss Lottie Hyam, and Miss Baber are billed as extra
talent.
Rumour is busy with a tale about a recent row, which
nearly culminated in blows, between two distinguished
N. military officers, the outcome being that one of
them left his post and has not since returned.

You don’t often see Mr. Pilcher, Q.C., in
the Criminal Court, but he was there last week to
defend T. M. Halveen, erstwhile well-known in
N.S.W. political circles, on a charge of malicious
wounding. The case arose out of the fact that
during a quarrel a man’s eye happened to be
injured by Dalveen’s umbrella. Defendant was
acquitted, and there appears very little doubt
that the occurrence was purely accidental.

gibbet would be too tender a punishment.

ton’s statement, and the decision of the Newtown
Labour League (presided over by his pal, Single-

is to be at liberty to vote as he pleases on fiscal
questions, prove that the N.S.W. Labour Elec-

Albert Victor, it is cabled, is to marry
Princess Victoria of Teck. As usual, it is the
biggest fool who weds the prettiest girl. The
Times hopes that ere she dies Queen Victoria will
be able to place her hand on the head of a child
who “will wear the Crown as third in order of
succession to herself.” Queen Victoria should be
happy then. She will see her three possible suc-
cessors left to fight the advancing Republic—a fat,
discredited sensualist; his son, a gawky imbecile
who doesn’t know enough to come in out of the
rain ; and the heir thereof, the attenuated result
of the in-breeding of—the Guelphs, a term which,
in itself, exhausts the vocabulary of invective.
Major Rae, the circus midget, is greater

over his dutiful spouse. On a recent Sunday,
while at the Zoo, they were given some porcupine-

the quills. “ Don’t do that, Jennie !” commanded
the Majah. Jennie paid no heed, so the irate
bantam seized the quill and wrenched it away
by brute force. The affectionate little woman
retaliated by cuddling up to her lord, tickling his
face with the emu feathers, and murmuring, “I
will teaze you for that, Major, indeed I will.”
When Dom Pedro, the ex-Emperor of
Brazil (he died the other day), visited Europe
some years ago, he did not change his
linen during periods of from a week to
ten clays, concealing the manifestations of this
neglect by means of a most extraordinary double-
breasted waistcoat with numerous buttons. In
proportion as the week advanced and the appear-
ance of his shirt-front became less immaculate, be
would increase the number of buttons used, until
on the sixth and seventh days the waistcoat was
buttoned right up close to the collar, leaving,
perhaps fortunately, no portion of the shirt-front
visible. The Emperor’s waistcoat, indeed, con-
stituted a species of calendar, enabling one to see
the days of the week.;— Argonaut.
Miss Valerie Wiedemann, the heroine of
the famous Walpole seduction and breach of
promise case, is now one of the leading cranks of
London. She is a faded, bilious-looking, young
woman with watery eyes, and a haggard,
monomaniacal expression, who drifts about the
city, selling concert-tickets to raise the wind for
more litigation. She button-holes strange men in
the streets, and backs them against walls, and
tells them the story of how Walpole ought to have
married her but didn’t, and when she is seen
coming along with her tale of woe and her tickets,
she can clear a building faster than an alarm of
fire. As for Walpole himself he is bankrupt
through law costs and damages, and has bolted to
the continent almost without ts. And here
endeth a big romance.

Stanley is still in Sydney, and still
telling- his dry and heartrending narrative of that
mystio continent, where unpronounceable names
chase eacli other over the sands, and shattered
consonants trample wildly upon crippled vowek
as they tear up and down the pages of the ereit
explorer s manuscript. The lecturer got down to
his saddest and dreariest level when he told th«
tale of how he shoved his uncalled-for personalitv
upon Livingstone. He had apparently gone over
this lecture with care, and torn up every item of
interest by the roots, and he fired off thedry bones
and remnants of the story with a dreary, mono
tonous sound like a brass image groaning in a nit
1 here is much expression of a certain kind in
Stanley s voice, but it isn’t suited to his present
surroundings. It ought to be heard in a ruined
and desolate city, under a glaring sun and sur
rounded by glaring yellow sand—a waterless ruin
with snakes and lizards in it all crawling
wretched y oyer the burning rocks. Then there
ought to be skeletons here and there, and a dessi
cated corpse in a tattered uniform and a broken
hat leaning up against the ramparts, and looking
with a dead eye through a warped and battered
telescope in search of the assistance that never
comes, and listening with a dead ear to the silence
of the buried ages. There should be haggard
ghosts floating around on fleshless feet, and sliZ
things made up of hair, and claws, and innumer
able legs, and bodies consisting principally 0 f
horrid squash and slime, should shuffle gloomilv
around, and shake their black and fire-blasted
front legs at each other in malevolent frenzy. Anri
in the midst of these cheerless scenes the great
explorer should sit on a dictionary and tell his
dismal tale in that voice which sounds so much
like the endless drip of falling water on top of a
hanged man’s skull. Then he would be eminently
suited to his surroundings, and his surrounding
wou d be eminently suited to him, and there
would be a great calm.
* * *
But when Stanley got to the end of his
story concerning how he found Livingstone and
started to tell how he found Emin instead he
woke up to unexpected energy. His delivery was
as monotonous as before, and the matter of his
discourse was full of the same solemn wretched-
ness which always pervades it, but there was an
undercurrent of rage and fathomless malevolence
winch kept the audience awake. From first to
last he did not utter a word concerning the
rescued ” Pasha which did not contain either
hatred, reproach, or contempt. The adventurous
scientist, who went almost alone into the wilder-
ness, and there built up a great kmgdom out of
unspeakable savagery, anarchy, and all manner
of hopeless elements—-who held his own against
all-comers for years and years without outside
assistance, and whose history is one of the most
astonishing features in the tale of modern Africa
-according to Stanley this individual was a fool
of the meanest order, a person only one remove
from an idiot, whose real place in life was that of
hanger-on to some society of ancient females,
ihe doings of Emin Pasha give the lie
direct to every word of this story, and
Stanley stands out conspicuously throughout
the narrative as a frantic ivory-hunter who feels
bad at not getting the plunder. The really inter-
esting features of the story are omitted, as usual.
1 he abandoned rear-guard, left behind under the
charge of a madman in a swamp, is practically
dropped out of sight. So is the language which
Stanley used to the wretched survivors when to
save their lives, they threw away the great man’s
hair-dye and personal luxuries. The alleged long
track of corpses which marked the road through
the great forest is not mentioned to any great
extent; and the explorer merely barks forth the
statement that on emerging from the wooded
region he crossed a great grassy plain, and camped
in a place 2000 feet above the level of the sea, and
the ghastly slaughter which is said to have taken
place on that same plain isn’t even alluded to.
After everyone of these statements the speaker
gets back to curse Emin afresh, and then he flies
off into more dreary facts, and rushes back to
curse Emin some more. And all through he is
obviously suffering under a disadvantage, for his
vocabulary is short, and his curses are far from
copious, and he suggests a man with a bad stutter
frantically shaking a lump of fat at Providence
because the remark that he wants to make has got
wrecked in his back teeth. Therefore, The Bul-
letin urges him to leap on his hat-or on Smythe’s
hat—at the more exciting parts of the discourse,
so as to relieve his feelings and to fill the gap
when words fail him. For if he doesn’t leap on
something, this paper is of opinion that he may
burst, and leave the Much-Travelled one without
any brigand.

The Juvenile Comic Opera Co., will pro-

Cuterion season. “The Mikado,” especially in
the case of Katisha, Yum Yum, and Nanki Poo,
is much beyond undeveloped, half-trained voices,
but, nevertheless, went down like hot cakes on the
premiere. It is splendidly staged, and on the
whole well played, though the acting is too
evidently a matter of much dr.ll, except in the
case of Alf. Stephens, whose Ko Ko, full of
dry humour and keen intelligence, is the event of

the way, it is not evident that Gilbert is improved
by being localised. “La Mascotte” is in hand,
but not yet dated. Messrs. L. J. Lohr and Pete
Hughes are to be found in front.

“The Grasshopper” is rubbishy, but,
nevertheless, it has been so ably handled during
past productions in Sydney that, up till now, it
enjoyed a reputation which Jennie Lee’s staging of
it at Sydney Garrick is likely somewhat to impair.
Hot onlyAs it indifferently cast, but a thin and
cold audience on first night were not disposed to
applaud even that which was meritorious. The
event was chiefly remarkable for J. P. Burnett’s
appearance as the handsome artist, Pygmalion
plippit; the atrocious Hielan’of Jimmy Hasker
who, as the innkeeper, doles out a laboriously-
gathered pile of Caledonian chestnuts, and the
first appearance of Frank Hawthorn in his old
man’s theatre. Jennie Lee, as wonderful in her
way as Nellie Farren, is bright and lively as ever,
jifow that “Jo ” has almost outworn a popularity
0 f 20 years’ standing, the little woman might pro-
fitably devote her attention to burlesque. “ Grass-
hopper ” is well staged; the backcloth, a river
scene, of the second act is very beautiful. The
Oogill Bros, come along with their Comedy and
Burlesque Co. on Saturday night.

Bondi Aquarium was officially opened last
week with a great flourish of trumpeters and
other inhabitants of the deep. Everyone of con-
sequence, and heaps of unconsequential people
were present, some armed with tickets of invita-
tion, others armed with equally persuasive bobs.
Refreshments of all kinds were served up in the
Club-house to the invitees, and after a big pro-
gramme had been gone through in the theatre,
the fish-tanks were inspected. The tanks are full
of every kind of fish known to iohthyophagi, and
a great many sorts unknown as edibles, but fair
to look on. Bondi, now better than new, is bound
to boom along while the hot weather lasts.

Last Saturday was a “souvenir night ” at
Sydney Her Majesty’s, when every entrant, save
the despised deadhead, received a gift, running
down from a twenty-guinea chronometer to a
shilling trinket. Constant changes of bill else-
where render one necessary here, and “Con-
fusion,” not seen for over two years, goes up on
Saturday night. King George, “Jim” Hazlett,
and Frank Ayrton are now very busy with the
“Babes,” in which Maggie Moore plays Robin
Hood, and Belle Bashall, who came out some
months ago under engagement to George Walton
and Dick Stewart for burlesque, plays Maid
Marian.

“Evangeline” does not seem to have
caught on so well with Sydney audiences as on
the prior trip, for the management announce a
revival of “The Corsair” for this (Thursday)
evening. Frank Emery is busily engaged on
“Forty Thieves,” which promises to be a most
gorgeous production, for 393 complete costumes
have arrived, it is said, from London. Mine.
Duvalli is coaching the ballet, who will caper
round Mdlle. Noel, the danseuse, who arrives
shortly with the Almontis (pantomimists), the
Cragge family of acrobat’, the Fairy Four, and
Ted Mason, the comedian, who plays AH Baba.
Miss Bearing will play Morgiana, Johnny Gour-
lay, Hussarac; Shine, Cogra Baba ; and a coming
American soubrette will be the Ganem.
Shakespeare has made another attempt to assert
himself at Melbourne Royal, but circumstances
were much against him, and the immortal bard’s
latest lease of life ran out on Saturday night. A
season of four consecutive nights was quite suffi-
cient for Divine William this time. No slim,
experienced actor, possessed of average intelli-
gence and laudable ambition can manage to,fail
egregiously as Hamlet, but Bentley gets very near
to that achievement. He dresses and poses like a
dandy, yet talks, at most times, like a hard,
matter-of-fact young Scotchman, either because he
°f that persuasion, or as the result of his
having played so much with Scotch companies
before Scotch audiences, and frequently in a Hee-
land character. Bentley’s unnustakeable accent
comes as a shook to anyone who remembers his
attractive Lyceum performance of Clarence, in
“Richard the Third,” years ago. In other
respects, too, he has gone from good to worse.
Desperately anxious to avoid speaking his
soliloquies after the manner of other Hamlets he
frequently allows the meaning of the lines to get
lost, and is incomprehensible in his originality.
There are no convincing signs of weakness and
melancholy about this business-like young man,
notwithstanding an occasional snivel and a
feminine wipe of his eye with a handkerchief, nor
does he suggest the awestruck condition of a
loving son who prowls out at midnight to converse
with t’ould man’s spectre. His vigorous dis-
courtesy and petulance, effective in the interviews
with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, are elsewhere
out of place—in short, Bentley’s performance of
Hamlet seems to suffer by comparison witli
many others that can be called to mind. A
Miss Laura Hansen, with a weak but sym-
pathetic voice and manner, made a negative
success as Ophelia. James Cathcart was, of
course, a very satisfactory Polonius, and Clifton
Alderson, as the Ghost, managed to get over the
ground in a more spectral manner than might
have been expected. The support in general was
of an exasperating nature, however, and the first
gravedigger deserves a word of reprobation for not
digging a larger hole and burying the whole crowd,
himself included. On Saturday night Mr. Bentley
appeared as Matthias, in “ The Bells,” but a tele-
gram on this subject was not urgently called for.

“ Hue and Cry ” struggles along at Mel"
bourne Opera House, and will probably hold the
boards until Saturday, anyhow. The softness of
this Darrellian yarn is not immediately apparent)
so the audience feel kindly disposed towards
George before he pops up in high life and becomes
wearisome. Charles Holloway, in the part of an
unsober ruin, is a general favourite ; also, an im-
possibly comic Chinaman attracts attention, as a
member of that ancient race which is destined to
conquer Australia ere another 4000 years have
passed away. A Melbourne journalist has just
called attention to this coming calamity, and it
behoves every native of the soil to start the
defence of his native land by killing the Chinese
invaders of his back-yard without delay.

The revival of “Marjorie,” at Melbourne
Princess, doesn’t make the original failure, or
comparative failure, of this handsome opera a
matter for surprise. It is now a little better than
the “Marjorie” of a year ago, inasmuch as a
weak third act has been pruned of some dialogue
and an interpolated pas-de-seul by Flora Graupner
is carefully left out, but the main fault of the
show is beyond the reach of any stage manager.
Some of the characters were conceived in a
serious, romantic spirit by one librettist, whilst
his partner was seemingly engaged in merging the
sublime into the ridiculous. The effect is inhar-
monious and irritating to a degree—as a work
of art, “ Marjorie ” can only be compared
with a piece of streaky bacon. Its serious
tableaux at the end of the first and second acts
are indeed very fine and mediaeval, but they
merely serve' to bring the story as a whole into
contempt, magnifying the absurdity of a chaotic
conclusion. Consistently good music might have
excused the libretto to some extent, but as most of
the melody is thin and tawdry, and the incidental
ballads have no immediate bearing on the subject,
the composer counts for very little more than in
an opera like “ The Old Guard.” Which reminds
us that a spicy ballet is badly wanted in this in-
stance. Girls didn’t kick high under the Feudal
System, but anachronisms can be freely pardoned
where leers are concerned, therefore a bevy of
Saxon maidens can-can ing around the tyrant
Norman earl would wake things up consider-
ably. Charles Ryley is a pleasant, picturesque
nobleman in the armour as of yore, whilst
Flora Graupner, Elsie Cameron, Elton, Bracy,
and Howard Vernon also do their duty again by
their former characters. The name part, well
sung by Florence Saville last time, introduced
Miss Marie Elster to general notice, on Saturday.
This lady, who has already faced audiences in
concert performances, was as shy as Miss Amelia
Martin on her first appearance in comic opera,
and after she had “ come out ” there seemed to
be much danger of her tottering in again and
seeking refuge behind the scenery. Miss Marie can
take heart, however. She has a pretty, unsophis-
ticated smile and manner, and her voice only
needs multiplying by two in order to make a
theatre ring again. It is a sweet and, doubtless,
an effective organ when she pulls out all the stops.
“Marjorie,” being almost a novelty, should last
over next week, by which time th •. . ia donna’s
prospects will be made clearer.

Grundy’s clover bub painfully artificial
comedy, “ The Silver Shield,” was presented to a
crowded Bijou on Saturday. The story, already
familiar to Sydney, deals with hearts blighted on
unsubstantial evidence, and the weakness of
jealous wives for taking to the stage at enormous
salaries. The moral seems to be that a lady who
is half an idiot in domestic life can rush away and
play leading characters in drama, which is rather
rough on the drama. Matrimonial misunder-
standings arise as easily as smoke from a
chimney in Grundy’s play, and a fond matron
no sooner picks up a suspicious - looking
letter, addressed to nobody, than she puts
on her “things” and wanders off into the
darkness, after bidding a tearful farewell to the
family piano, and the coal-scuttle, and all the
other bits of furniture she has learned to love so
well. Previously she has purposely dropped her
wedding-ring upon the dear old carpet, as a token
that she has been married for the last time. Then
another lone, lost wife finds the ring, and
remembering that she also used to chuck her
golden circlet about when she was jealous, grasps
the horror of the situation just in time to be too
late. Luckily circumstances are ridiculously
favorable to an all-round explanation, and the
parted couples become reunited. Their belief in
the advantages of matrimony is somewhat pathetic.
The Brough and Boucicault company, who do
nothing badly, are moderately successful in “ The
Silver Shield.” It runs for six nights only, and
on Saturday there will be a first Bijou perform-
ance of “Led Astray” by the whole strength of
the B. and B. forces.

At the Alexandra they are still supping on
the reckless atrocities of “This Great City,” and
sundry other shows are getting over the dull time
between now and Boxing Night as quickly as
possible.
Some Hamlets like the tempest rage,
And nightly howl around the stage,
Whilst others play the sighing sage
And scold their mothers gently ;
But one adopts the simple plan
Of acting like a blunt young man
Who runs a shop or drives a van ;
And this is Walter Bentley.
At Poverty Point.
Walter Silbon says that circus-men, who lead decent
lives, die no sooner than other men.
The favourite book of Major Rae, the dwarf with Sells’
Circus, is “ Looking Backward." He grows quite
eloquent w'hen discussing it. He thinks Rider Haggard’s
works are most pernicious for children and young women.
He read “ She ” and “ King Solomon’s Mines,” and then
abandoned Rider Haggard, “for he would make a man
dotty.”
Sells’ contortionists are simply freaks of nature. They
are “ born limber,” and never strain themselves or get
sore. Rexo tells a yarn of a man who, “ born limber,”
never saw a contortionist until 20 years of age, and who,
on his first attempt, executed nearly all the human serpent’s
twists. The folks at Rexo and Reno’s boarding-house
come into their bed-room to see if they sleep in rubber
blankets, they sniff the air for the patent liniment, and
one Sydney athlete offered them £2O for their “snake-
oil ” and then went home and broke a blood-vessel strain-
ing to emulate them. Practice and liniments can no
more develops a contortionist than hair-oils can develop
hair on a bald spot.
Walter Silbon is practising three mid-air somersaults,
and says he will attempt this apparently impossible feat
in public in about 12 months’ time.
The way to touch the circus-elephant s soul is to whistle
down his trunk. One day, in America, a Britisher com-
menced to whistle “Britons,” &c. “Mac” coiled his
trunk up, and slinging it out against the blower’s chest
stretched him senseless on the earth.
Work, regular feeding, and work, are the main factors
in taming the performing elephant. His salary is a
couple of pounds of sweets paid nightly after coming off.
His cue is the elephant-hook, which, from the audience,
appears to he a toy-whip scarce large enough to whip a
cat. But the thong conceals a spike and hook each two
inches in length. The spike, when stuck into the trunk or
into the body behind the near fore leg, “makes him caper,
by criky.” The hook, when yanked into the tender spot,
behind the ear, brings the great beast down on his knees,
and makes him whimper and tremble like a convulsed
infant, The motto taught the elephant by his trainer is :
good performance—sweets ! Bad performance—elephant-
hook !
Baby Stirk, only three years of age, already earns her
bread and butter—that is, her milk-sop and sugar, on her
diminutive bicycle.
In the great aerial feat of the Silbons the strain on th e
partner who catches the other is terrible. Fancy hang-
ing by the legs, head-down, and catching by the hands a
man of 1641b5. weight, after he has swung from a distance
of 74ft. and turned two somersaults 1
When Allan Sells was asked if he punished the hippo-
potami so as to make them so tractable, he replied—“ No,
sir, handling them since they were babies is the way we
tamed them. Our animals are too valuable to be knocked
about. It’s only when we come along to your country, and
you kill our horses for us, and quarantine our infected
animals along with your healthy ones in the Zoo that they
suffer.” The hippopotami are fed on anything in the
vegetable-line—mostly grain and chopped feed.
The Arab Hercules, who bears up seven men at Sells’
Circus, is of splendid physique. He measures 52 inches
round the expanded chest, and 16 inches round the
biceps. His muscles have that springy feel that one
rarely finds in big men. The giant goes slow in the
sword duel now. At one time, when he was set flourish-
ing his weapon to music, he was apt to put in a “ rtd-
hot-’un ” now and again so as to impart a little zest to the
game.
Darmont’s gruesome play, “Pauline Blanchard,” has
been a failure in America.
That £20,000 legacy of Magee’s has already doubled
itself —in print. He is now said to be going “ home” to
claim £40,000.
A Melbourne weekly refers to G. C. Miln as the son of a
parson, and remarks that the fact is apparent in his
elocution. Miln himself was the parson, one of the most
popular and biggest-salaried preachers in America, and
when he walked out of the pulpit to play Hamlet, at the
head of his own company, a great crowd of fashionable
forsaken sheep rolled up to cheer the shepherd on his
way. Church and Stage have never come in closer con-
tact than on the night of Miln’s first appearance as a
play-actor. But he isn’t of parsonic descent or theatrical
extraction by 7 any means. The bohemian strain in Miln’s
too full supply of blood came no doubt from his mother,
the daughter of a gifted but now forgotten litterateur—
“ Christopher North”—who wrote Times leaders in that
paper’s halcyon days.
This is how a dramatic critic liar exposes his fraudulent
hand in a Sydney evening paper. After a few intro-
ductory sobs of sympathy for bad business all-round, he
devotes himself separately to each show-house and ex-
plains: “ ‘ Evangeline ’ is booming along,” “ The Criterion
is crammed nightly,” “Jenny Lee has every reason to be
satisfied with receipts,” “‘Youth’ continues to draw
packed houses/’ “ Stanley 7 has had a phenomenal run.”
Now, what is a bewildered public to believe?
Last Saturday morning, while practising, one of Sells’
trapeze acrobats missed his hold, fell into the net, bounced
out of it on to the ground—a fall of ten feet—and sprained
his back and neck very seriously 7.
Anyone acquainted with the amateur athlete is aware
of his pitiable self-denial while training. Sells’ circus
contortionists, always in splendid buckle, eat what they
fancy, and drink any thing in moderation. One smokes,
on an average, 12 cigars a day ; the other smokes cigar-
ettes incessantly.
Hadj Le Mahafode Cherin, the priest of the Arabs with
Sells’ Circus, is a good soul. When we entered the dress-
ing-room he was squatting—for that is the correct pose
of the contrite Moslem —and his glittering eye was fixed
on eternity. He told us afterwards that he was praying
when we entered, and that he didn’t stop for anybody,
not even for us. He prays five times a day regularly, and
washes himself from head to foot prior to each act of
devotion. We pass this leaf out of the Koran along to
General Booth. All the “submerged tenth” that we
have come into collision with struck us as wanting sub-
merging very badly 7.
Jennie Opie, who has achieved such a success with
Williamson’s Opera Co., is a native of Moonta (S.A.)
Moonta is famous for producing good vocalists ; the popu-
lation is mostly 7 Cornish.
Siraonsen’s Opera Co. appeared at Adelaide Royal under
disadvantageous circumstances. All the dresses and
scenery—what there was of the latter—were left behind
at Serviceton by the railway people, and they had to
appear in evening dress the first night. There was a big
row over the matter, and Italian profanity was very pre-
valent on the Saturday evening.
Lectures don’t go down in Brisbane. When Charles
Clark was there he often had to apologise for not being a
circus or a variety-show, as the Brisbane bald-heads
stumped out for their nine o’clock snake-juice. A lecture
to the Brisbaneite is a one-act performance. Five acts is
the lowest endurable limit in the thirsty North.
In his matchless serial feat Walter Silbon starts his
swing from a cross-bar 74ft. distant from his partner,
Herbert, and after leaving the swing traverses 18ft. while
turning the double-somersault. His hands must come
within 6in. of those of his partner, who, suspended on
another swing, eatohes him. Steadiness of nerve is all-
essential. Young men of dissolute habits, listen to Mr.
Silbon on smoking and be advised. “Regularly I smoke
ten cigars a day and two bunches of cigarettes.” Also all
intoxicants stronger than whisky are religiously eschewed
by him, for Mr. Silbon says: “Drink stronger than
w hisky completely undermines a man’s nervous system,
and when a man’s nervous system is done, the man’s
done. Black coffee in moderation is good for the wind.”
It took five years of constant practice—from 10 to 30
attempts every day—to enable him to perform his won-
drous feat at all.
At latest Paderewski (who will be here soon) had a 6000
audience at Manchester who stood on chairs and howled
until P. had played them his own minuet.
Said that the Parisian theatrical censorship is to be
abolished. Quite time, it has long been a farce.
A. M. Denison, the actor who lately committed suicide
in New York, will be known to many of the profession in
Australia as a good fellow 7 , and a capable man. He has
been attached to the Kendals’ company during their last
three tours in America, where he was very popular. His
acting and make-up as an old Tory sw 7 ell could not be ex-
celled. In “ Aunt Jack ” he was the very counterpart in
manner of Lord Augustus Loftus in his best mood.
H. R. Harwood and wife returned to Melbourne by the

Rudyard Kipling’s last novel, in collaboration with
Walcott Balestier, now appearing in the Century, has
been dramatised by the authors. The copyright per-
formance took place lately at London Opera Comique.
Title, “The Naulahka, a tale of West and East.”
Edward Terry, writes our London correspondent, has
fairly “struck oil” with Pinero’s new 7 play, “The Times ”
It is considered the best thing the author has done, and
will prove, like “Sweet Lavender,” a little gold-mine to
the lucky actor-manager. The bookings are enormous,
and seats can’t be had before the end of November.
London Star made a serious mistake the other day in
asserting that the Countess Cadogan, potential mother-
in-law to one of the Royal Princesses, was in the habit of
disporting herself on the stage as a super. They confused
her with an elderly, gay, fiaxen-haired lady who is a
conspicuous figure at all race meetings on Newmarket
Heath, where she follows the start of every event. This
frivolous old party was stage-smitten, and very frequently
made her appearance at various London theatres to the
great scandal of her friends. She is not the only mem-
ber of the aristocracy who has the same mania. The wife
of Lord de , one of the oldest titles in the peerage,
whilst her husband was away in America shooting, used
every night to drive from her house in Park Lane to the
London Avenue, in her smart brougham, and disport
herself in tights amongst the coryphees. She is a splen-
didly-formed woman, and is naturally proud of the fact,
and on the stage she was the cynosure of neighbouring
eyes. The matter got so talked about that her husband
gave up his trip and returned hurriedly to London to
insist upon the discontinuance of her freaks.
Zerbini, the cleverest Melbourne musico, ceased playing
his earthly viola the other day. Unparalleled on the
rumbo-thrumbo, brilliant on the piano, excellent on the
organ, he was what they called a double-handed musician,
rather eminent even in London, which he would not have
left hut for his health. He was a big, fat man, with an
everlasting look of far-away, dreamy benevolence, as he
munched a cigarette and beamed through Iris specs.,
while his mind weltered in a new op. for the string quar-
tette, which he popularly bossed—a more than decent
fellow.
England V. N.S. Wales.
A tremendous crowd rolled up on Saturday last
at Sydney Association ground to see the cricket match
between Lord Sheffield s team and N.S.VV. The grand-
stand and lawn were choke-full, the outside ground was
occupied to the last inch, the members’stand was crowded,
and the ladies overflow ed from their reserve and invaded
the domains of the men in the upper-gallery. The great
attraction was Grace. “ Which is him?” was the query
one heard as soon as people got into the ground. He has
got no older than when he was here half a generation ago,
hut he is a tremendous lot fatter. He is a very big, powerful
man with a bristly black beard nearly to his waist, some-
what slanting eyes, great muscular arms and huge hands.
And, Great Scott—such feet ! He could get two
pounds a week and his tucker merely to walk about
in the grasshopper districts to kill off the pest.
He bats as well as ever, his eye being ns true and his arm
as strong as in the days of old ; but when it comes to
bow ling, he is a bit off. He rolls up to the crease with a
lumbering action like a Clydesdale colt and delivers the
ball with a cunning spin that wants watching, but he is
not dangerous to careful batsmen. When fielding he
stands point, where he does not have to run, and any ball
within possible reach is sure to And a resting-place in one
of his vast, carpet-bag-like hands.
# * #
Next in interest to Grace was Lord Sheffield.
He is a little, fat, stumpy man for all the world like an
English fanner of the old standard type. Hair long and
straggly,* lips and face roughly shaven, and a little fringe
of beard left under the chin, eyes small and cute ; thick-
necked, heavy-jowled, obstinate, good-natured, and
shrewd, his Lordship is just the sort of man that would
make a fine landlord for a bush pub. All readers of the
“Golden Shanty” will remember the picture of Mr.
Michael Doyle, the landlord of the lonesome pub., on the
outside of the book. Well, that picture is as good a like-
ness of Lord Sheffield as any man can want. It could
hardly be improved on. And all far-downers, cockatoos,
sw'aggies, shearers, rouseabouts, and cornstalks generally
are hereby informed that if they want to know what a
real live English lord is like, they should buy the “Golden
Shanty” and study the picture on the outside.—[Advt.
P.S.— We can here see melud buying the “Golden Shanty'.”]
To return to our mutton, his Lordship—he is a great
“sport,” taking a lively interest in, and spending a heap of
money over it. He is’ said to be very averse to women,
and will not have one near his place. Yet he can’t
keep outside the influence of lovely woman, for
it is on record that, on the voyage out, the
beauteous “ Witch of Atlas,” w'ho travelled in the same
ship, one day (wdthout his knowledge), for a wager,
“ willed ” him into the ship’s smoking-saloon, and into
that saloon he went in no time. It is also recorded that
the witch has willed that he shall leave Australia
unmarried —which at once settles the matter. It is hardly a
great ambition for one of England’s noblemen to spend his
money and his time carting a cricket team about the
world. Still, it is better than many things other noble-
men do, so w'e must not complain. He sat in the mem-
bers’ pavilion all the time, quite absorbed in the game.
* # *
Jersey was there hovering round Sheffield like
an amiable flamingo. Also, George Dibbs and George
Reid w andered about together in the most amicable way,
raising some cheering and some chaffing from the crowd.
The crowd, by the way, are none too fond of seeing then-
own men go out. When Alick Bannennan was given out,
a bit of a howl was raised though no one outside the
enclosure could possibly tell whether the decision was
right or wrong ; again, when Iredale was given out, being
palpably caught by the bowler, another hoot was raised.
This sort of thing savours very strongly of the win, tie or
wrangle school, and should be put down sharply. The
game itself was as dismal as ever. The only thing that
redeemed its intolerable dulness was that the wickets
were bad, so the stonewallers got out quicker than
usual. Even then the New South Wales men took
four hours to make 132 runs, being at the rate of
33 runs an hour. Massie and Bonnor used to score at the
rate of 70 runs an hour,and the difference in watching
the two games can be imagined. The stonewallers are
killing cricket, and a good job, too. At present it is a
game that a nation should be ashamed to play, a game
without risk, without dash, without excitement, and only
needing that kind of skill which is developed by the spot-
stroke billiardist who keeps on monotonously potting the
red. The spot-stroke has been barred to make the game
of billiards worth watching, and the stone-walling will
have to be barred in some way to make cricket worth
watching. The very bowlers have given up bowling at
the wickets, and now bowl far to the off to try and tempt
men to hit One trembles to think what the afternoon
would have been like on Saturday if the wickets had been
true and if Bannennan and Donnan had got fairly set. It
is time that crick; t either livens up or gives way to some-
thing else. In the end the Englishmen won by four
wickets, the respective scores being N. S. Wales first
innings, 74 ; second, 172 ; English Eleven, first innings, 94;
second, 6 wickets for 155.
Two absolute essentials for the existence
of the human race are—land and air. Many
economic and political systems have been invented
and are advocated for obtaining land for each
individual to live upon, but it has been left to the
Hydraulic Cooling and Ventilating Co. to intro-
duce pure air into every habitation in Australia,
by means of their “Perfection” Cooler and
Ventilator. By attaching this machine to your
water supply or tank, and simply turning on the
tap, a constant stream of pure, fresh air can be
obtained in any chamber you desire. Punkahs
are thus superseded, perishable goods can be kept
at a small expense without ice, and you can enjoy
the luxury of a cool chamber on the hottest day or
night. The machine, which is simplicity itself,
works at the cost of one half-penny per day, while
the price brings it within the reach of most.
Send for particulars or inspect the machines work-
ing in our offices. T. A. Knight and Co., St.

POLITICAL
POINTS
A modified Black Wednesday looms ahead
of the N.S.W. Civil Service.
Premier Munro is said to be “all things
to all men.” Yea, the wrong thing to the wrong
man every time.
Parnell : “ The political ecclesiastic is the
mistake of history ; he is always a partisan, and
almost always a bigot.”
“ Oh, no, if white men in Australia won’t
work more than eight hours a day Chinamen will
step in.”—Rudvakd Kipling.
Parkes : “ Hi cannot for a moment admit
that George Reid has any title whatever to Vie
considered a man to deal with public affairs.”
“ Protection is dead ” —sang the prophets
at la c t N.S.W. general election. “ Yow, here’s a
Protective tariff !” now squeal the same parties.
Three more foreign railway appointments.
One more laboured explanation, officially inspired,
in Sydney D.T. The thing is getting wearisome.
How about that promissory-note cashed
for a N.S. Wales statesman by a land-jobbing
company about the time of the Bur wood railway
. proposals ?
N.S.W. Protection will lead to Australian
Federation and interprovincial Freetrade. Aus-
tralian Federation will lead to the Australian
Republic.
The N.S.W. Labour-party accuses some of
its members of trying to sell the vote of the party
to Dibbs in exchange for the portfolio of Minister
of Industry.
The N.S.W. Parliament allows the hang-
man and the gaol-flogger a vote each, but denies
a vote to the pauper who has failed to supply the
hangman with a job.
Does Oscar Meyer intend sueing the N.S.
Wales Government for breach of agreement in
cancelling his Chicago Exhibition appointment ?
And if not, why not ?
The N.S.W. Foreign-trade party used to
sneer at the Protectionists, “Bah! You have no
leader.” Where is the man who can lead all the
Freetrade party now ?
Gladstone’s Liberalism looks queer from
an Australian point of view. He urges that
Labour M.P. ’s, who want a salary, should first
make an affidavit of poverty !
Bananaland Ms.P. got last year under the
regular-screw system, £19,200; under the old
style per attendance, the return shows that the
sum would only have been ,£7786 IGs.
The S.M. Herald styles the University
of New Zealand an “ antipodean university.”
Which proves what we have so often said —that
the Herald’s home-centre is Hingland.
“Federation does not necessarily mean a
National Protectionist tariff,” saith Parkes. In
other words, Private Murphy avers that it is not
he, but the regiment, which is out of step.
Parkes: “The Parliament hof N.S.W.
’as literally done nil during the ’ole hof the year
. . . the’ole year’as been prodigally wasted.”
And the party who wasted it was named ’Enry
Parkes.
The first batch of the cheap Italians who
are to save the Queensland sugar industry has
duly arrived to the number of 331 all told ; or 271
working bachelor adults, 21 married pairs and 18
children. God bless the new curse !
Stock phrase of the Bone-Idler press :
“The great pastoral and agricultural industries
which form the backbone of the country.”
To us the phrase seems mighty stingy ;
They’re not the backbone, but the bingey.
At nine o’clock one night last week, a
N.S.W. politician was incapably drunk in a
Sydney hotel. The House sat late, and the mem-
ber revived sufficiently to deliver an able and
argumentative speech. A late sitting has its
advantages after all.
Ninian Melville has introduced a Bill pro-
viding for free education in N.S.W. This is cue
of the many respects in which N.S.W. has lagged
behind Victoria. To be justly compulsory, edu-
cation must be both secular and free. In N.S.W.
it is neither secular nor free.
Bruce Smith’s sneer at Treasurer See ,( s
“ Susscx-street accountancy ” will not be forgotten
by the produce-merchants. In any case, Mr.
Smith overlooked the fact that when he was
manager for Howard Smith and Co. the firm’s
offices were in Sussex-street, Sydney.
“The degrading dictates of that set of
persons called —‘thoLabor-party.’” That was what
Parkes said, but it was not exactly what he
meant. What the nice old gentleman meant was
what he said late one night when he rushed to
the table of the N.S.W. Assembly and shook his
fist at Premier Jennings.
Prom Sydney Echo :
An eye to business: Messrs. Dibbs, Slattery, and Co.
have placed Palm Oil on the free-list.
This is only capable of one construction. Palin
Oil means bribery and corruption. Perhaps they
wanted it to oil P with.
Without the slightest reference to the
Treasurer who represents the country, the N.S.W.
Railway Commissioners disburse sums of money
at their own sweet will to persons who are injured
on the lines. The Treasury ought to be put into
commission—the other bureau as well, and then
1 arliament could be dispensed with.
The Workers’ Political Organisation is
astir in Queensland, where the worker has been
delivered into the hands of those who perpetually
banquet off his necessities. Glassey, M.L.A.,
intends stumping the province during recess to
enlighten people concerning the “lawyer Govern-
ment and the squatting Parliament.”
Hie events of the last few days have
eloquently emphasised The Bulletin’s contention
that what the Labour party most urgently needs
is—a leader. From Houghton’s public attitude
at Lurwood on Saturday night, it would appear
that he considers himself leader, but there has
been no caucus announcement to that effect.
“ Mr. Reid’s Freetrade principles,” de-
clares Sydney D.T., “areas patent and as well-
known to the people of N.S.W. as the stars of
the Southern Cross.” And yet he voted for the
manufacturein N.S.W. (at a tremendously advanced
cost) of all rolling stock for the State Railways !
when he thought lie could gain some kudos with
Labour’s representatives.
There is a show of reason in the Chinese
Government explanation of those much-cabled
massacres—viz., that a couple of thousand Chow
marauders are “ going for ” the Christ’an mission
stations on account of the money that has been
staked up for the conversion of the heathen.
John lias got his oblique eye on the Exeter Hall
collections.
“It is in the refreshment-room, not in
the Legislative Chamber, that opponents are won
over and opinions changed,” says W. S. Paul,
M.L. A. (Q.) True, but old. Pope put it fnore
neatly :
The shortest way to men’s hearts I And,
Lies through their bellies, or I mistake mankind.
The estimates of the late N.S.W. Ministry
were specially framed to show a surplus. Not-
THE JUDEN-HETZE.
BOWLER (appealing for a dubious catch): “How’s that?”
UMPIRE: “What’s the batsman’s name?”
CHORUS: “Israel.”
U MPIRE: “Out!”
withstanding the nervousness of the British
money-lenders, and the trend of local public
opinion, the Parkes party excluded from its
estimates a large number of utterly unproductive
public works, and charged them to the loan-funds
as usual.
“The N.S.W. Labour-party is seriously
threatened by differences on the fiscal questions.
Most of the Protectionists supported Freetrade
when party policy required it, but the Freetraders
■don’t seem to be able to swallow Protection when
the po ition is reversed. The Labour-man who
will split ranks on a trumpery fiscal question may
not boa traitor, bufhe certainly is a fool”—says
The Worker.
Bruce Smith has been in high glee since
he read a casual reference to his “Liberty and
Liberalism ”by an Oxford professor. A Sydney
politician once made copious quotations from tins
book in Parliament House; but Bruce Smith did
not then ostentatiously claim the incident as “a
gratifying recognition from a high authority of
the influence of his political writings.” Is it a
fact that the book has been withdrawn from sale
in Sydney ?
Two of the “ mottoes” displayed at Nowra
for Parkes’ benefit last week were—“ Love one
another” and “Welcome, British JLion !”
“ Love one another”—since you’ve set your ’eart on
Repudiating facts with Edmund Barton ;
“ Love one another ’’—love George Houston Reid ;
Thrice “ Welcome, British Lion,” chiinpanzecd !
Nay, get not hon thy tail! But, once again,
’Ail, British Lion hof Himperial mane !
Premier Playford says. that since the
establishment of Responsible Government in
South Australia in ’s6—which brought into play
the One-man-one-vote principle in that province -
several attempts have been made to alter the Con-
stitution in various directions, but there has never
been evinced the slightest desire to alter or abolish
the One-man-one-vote. That is a sufficient
answer to all talk about the system being “ an
experiment” and a “ dangerous innovation.”
“ It seems necessary to point out to dull
and stupid restrictionists that the oath of alle-
giance refers to the Queen personally and her
heirs, and not merely to the Crown, and any man
who has publicly expressed his belief in Repub-
licanism is guilty of something very like perjury
in subsequently taking the oath,” says the Sydney
Cuckoo. Well, at present Australians have before
them two alternatives—(l) treason to Australia,
(2) perjury. Let us, therefore, commit enforced
perjury.
Premier Dibbs is to be asked to call upon
Monty Arnold, State-pensioner, broker, and
investor, either to resume his old position of Clerk
of the Select Committees, or to forego his pension.
He got his pension on the alleged ground of
suffering from an incurable malady—-but notwith-
standing this “malady” he is able to supervise
the investment of his capital, carry on a large
broking-business, direct the noxious National
Association, and run for Parliament when there’s
a vacancy in the representation of the family seat.
The week before last the old, clammy
Argus came out with two distinct howls. The
first was a demand for Free Speech, and a yell
against certain alleged individuals who, it was
claimed, desired to smother the monopolistic
“National” Association. The second, which
appeared next day, was a hoarse bark of rage
against certain municipal authorities who had
allowed their town-halls to be used for meetings to
advocate the abolition of plural-voting, that not
being the variety of Free Speech the Argus was
pining after.
“The Freetrade party is the party of
economy.” On the very day upon which Parkes
resigned, leaving behind him an empty Treasury
and a mountain of debt, he wrote with his own
hand and sent to England to his old friend,
sculptor Woolner, an order for three statues, to
adorn Sydney public offices, at 3000 guineas
apiece! No particulars concerning the size-, &e.,
of the statues appear in this extraordinary
order, and it will be interesting to learn whether
the details of the matter were entrusted to Mr.
Oscar Meyer. The order has been countermanded
by cable by Parkes’ successors.
The S.M. Herald should surely be satis*
tied with misrepresenting Toby Barton in its
editorials ; it need not suppress the points of his
Ministerial utterances. The Bulletin is not in a
position to say that the Herald editor or “Mr.
James ” instructed the Herald reporters to sup-
press all the telling passages in Toby Barton’s
scathing exposure of the Parkes Administration.
But it is in a position to say that the report
reflects the utmost discredit on the Herald
reporters. Let a comparison between Hansard
and the Herald decide whether The Bulletin is
not understating the case.
Parkes again boasts that he was 12 years
in Parliament ere he took office. How often was
he asked ? Once. And even then the offer was
not hona-Hde, for it was known he was insolvent
and not in a position to gain re-election. The
fact is that Parkes is a perfect wolf as an office-
seeker and snarls like a hungry tyke when deprived
of his only means of liviny. Look at the old
Anglo-Saxon savage to-day ! At Kiama telling
people from the platform that they “were not
human,” that they were “monkeys,” and “ luna-
tics,” and that they should “go outside and get
drunk and be locked up by the police.’’
Sir John Hay, as president of N.S. VY.
Legislative Council, holds a Crown appointment.
The Civil Service Apt is treated as a dead-letter
in relation to political septuagenarians. John
Smith, a clerk at <£2oo or .£3OO in the Lands-
office, is promptly retired when he passes his
sixtieth year. But Sir John Hay, a rich man, is
permitted to hang on to his billet, though he is
well past his seventieth year, and is, moreover,
physically unable to fill the sinecure he has held
for 20 years at a handsome salary. If a minister
of the crown is incapacitated, his department is
administered by a colleague ; but when Sir John
Hay is incapacitated his department—the Legis-
lative Council—is allowed to go ministerless until
he chooses to die or get well again.
Parkes spoke to-Kiama “as one anxious
by every means in my power to avoid the necesaio,
for taking office. ” Which means—
Just keep me hin your lieye.
Hand wait till by-and-bye,
The Hold Man haint so tired has ’e looks;
Hit’s honly for ha spell
Hi’m ’idden hin my shell,
To ’elp some hold hand confidential crooks.
So keep me hin yourheye,
Hi'll ’ave hanother try—
My mouth was made for plums,
And, when the first chance comes,
Why—keep me hin your heye. ’
The N.S.W. Protectionists must either
have a morning Protectionist paper of their own
or else contract with Sydney D.T. to circulate I
dady Hansard. Bruce Smith and Toby Barton
spoke for exactly two hours each the othev
night over the tariff debate. Barton’s speech
covers 39 columns in Hansard and one column i,
Herald as against Smith’s 35 columns i
Hansard and over three columns in Herald i
Considering that Bruce Smith and Barton" are
equally representative men and that both spoke
at a time when they could well be reported tlu>
facts set forth reflect the utmost discredit on the
reputation of the Herald as an impartial record
of debates. 1
Sydney Evening News —an alleged
people s paper—runs a “society ” paper in which h
apparently prints any articles not palatable to the
mass of its daily readers. In a recent issue of its
autocratic paper it reprints, with marked plea',
sure, a long extract from what it calls “ a '
excellent leader ” on Imperial Federation. The
tone and the trutli of this “ excellent leader” can
be judged by a reference to the election of ‘ki
Labor-members to the N.S.W. Parliament, “jn
Australia,” comments the writer of this “excellent
leader, the excesses of a certain section of tlm
population have steadied the leaders of politics
and rallied the better - educated and better-
minded of the people round the standard of
political and economic honesty.”
F. W. Ward, ex-editor of Sydney Dailv
Telegraph, who is writing to London Times on
the “ Commonwealth of Australia,” makes a bin-
song about England having trusted her
‘ Southern sons ” “in the loan of many millions
sterling.” This is mixing up business and senti-
ment in the most confounded manner. England
was simply looking for someone to bleed— as she
always is—and she chose Australia. Anon she
choose Argentina, but we don’t hear much about
the “Southern sonship ” of Argentina. Now
when finances are a bit tight with her, and she is
herself being bled, she doesn’t bother about her
/Southern sons,” but tells them to “stop borrow-
ing and remember bow much you owe me.”
Ward writes well, but it is impossible to stand
drivel even when well written.
Parkes is drifting into the political isola-
tion of an Ishmael. One of his fads is Ereetrade
and, behold ! bis anti-Federation enemy, Reid'
leadeth the Ereetrade party in especial, and the
Opposition as a whole. Another of Parkes' fads
is Federation, and, behold ! his co-champion of
Federation, Tobias Barton, hath gone over to
Ibbbs, the Protectionist. Lo ! the ass standeth
between two bundles of hay—Ereetrade and
no Federation ; Protection and a some-time
Federation. Parkes must now form a strict
Federation party of his “hone.” Then the N.S.W.
Assembly will contain within itself—l, the Bibbs',
party; 2, the Reid-party ; 3, the Labour-party ■
4, the Retrenchment or O’Sullivan-party ; 5, the
Federation or Parkes-party ; 6, Mr. Crick ai d
Mr. Willis.
We observe that Mr. George Black, M.L.A.,
according to a Sunday paper, took occasion
to state the other night to his constituents in
West Sydney that he had never been on a Pro-
tectionist paper, and that during bis connec-
tion with The Bulletin he “used all his power
and influence to keep Protection down in it.” In
reply The Bulletin has merely to state (1) that
it is now and has always been a Protectionist
paper of the most uncompromising type; (2) that
Mr. Black’s presence or absence never made any
difference in the policy of The Bulletin; (3)
that the editor never enquired and never knew
Mr. Black’s exact fiscal opinions which were of no
more consequence to The Bulletin than the fiscal
opinions of any other person who had no power to
commit the paper.
Filibuster Stanley having, accord ng to his
own brag, prospected South Africa in the name of
the Loar’d for all the European thieves who want
to not only steal the black man’s land, but also
steal and enslave the nigger himself, “ has strong
views on the black-labour question.” Natural
this, on the part of the man whq has irresponsibly
lorded it over so much black or brown humanity.
So he fells a Sydney reporter that Northern Aus-
tralia ought to be run by—no, not by, but on-
black labour. And why, think you ? Because
(italics are our own ) :
The people who are most interested, the people who
own the land up there, who have invested their money in
it, should be allowed to say what they will do with their
country.
Their country ! The people who own the land are
the most interested? The governing classes again!
A few years ago the Victorian farmer, who
now whoops so loudly for the capitalist and .two
votes, arrived on his selection with a lame horse
and a tip-dray loaded with a broken plough and
several children, and according to bis unimpaired
vision, no man had a right to hold more then 320
acres. After practically giving away the land,
the Government, by building railways and grant-
ing every concession asked for, have placed him
in an independent position, and with the aid of
the bank ho can keep on continually increasing
his area, which lie religiously does. Ho will tell
you how, by bis own individual effort, he has
made bis farm worth what it is, never admitting
that national progress had anything to do with it.
In most cases it was bis sons who did the work,
and very often Ins daughters, while the old man
sat in the shade and cursed the large landholder.
Truly a man without either land or money is the
only real democrat.

content with being one mule.
Gov. Jersey, as everybody has lately been
informed, was quite a famous runner in his youth.
A sort of scarlet runner, uo doubt.
Tom Bracken, Maoriland’s sweetest poet,
is on a visit to Australia on business connected
with a new volume of his poems just issued.
The Czar of Russia is the best paid of
European sovereigns. He takes home .£20,000

Lord Jersey says : “ The name of Stanley

Joe Thompson is at his old “flash”

The insufferably-advertised Mrs. Frank
Leslie—now Mrs. Frank Leslie Wilde—has been
three times married. She was a divorcee when
she wedded Leslie.
Mrs. Bernard-Beere claims to be the god-

may be ; one thing is pretty certain —Mrs. B. was

Judge Redmond Barry-once threatened to
commit barrister Byron Miller. “Should you do
so, I won’t be the worst thing your Honor has
committed,” retorted Miller.
W. G. Grace, the Jumbo of the English
team, is very fat. His waddle up to the wicket
when bowling suggests that he learnt his paces in
the same school as Sells’ hippopotami.
More in-breeding. It now seems pretty
certain that Albert Victor is to marry his cousin
Victoria of Teck. Better for the house of Guelph
that its heir should elope with and marry the
cook.
Ward, Lock, Bowden and Co. sold, within
a year, 30,000 copies of “ Digger Dick’s Darling,?

During a recent debate in N.S.W.
Assembly, Mr. Newman, M.L.A., said that he
had taken out 20 tons of gold from where Toms
and Lister first found the metal in payable
quantities.
Lord Augustus Loftus soon tired of
Bruges, and he is back at Leatherhead, where
young Gussy, who still takes shelter under the
paternal wing, can indulge in his favourite hobby
of chicken-rearing.
j||Lord Sheffield has a quiet unostentatious
way cf doing things. He instructed Shaw, his
manager, to find out the names of all the Adelaide
charities, and the day before he left Adelaide
cheques were sent all round.
David Jones, the big Sydney rag-man, has
amalgamated with Thompson, of Thompson and
Giles. While Jones and Thompson were amal-
gamating they might just as well have taken in
Smith and Brown, also Robinson.
A Bathurst (N.S.W.) editor makes his
rotund and hated rival go to a tailor for a suit,
at £3. The tailor introduced his tape. “Forty,
fifty, sixty, seventy,” and then he stopped.
“Sir,” said he, “for £3 I cannot go further.”
The three reporters who “did” the in-
quest re the London Gaiety Theatre chorus-girl
were paid £27 for their “notes ” of the evidence.
Hence the meagre particulars published of the
giddy girl’s relations with certain effete Per-

The Melbourne newspapers called the big
South Melbourne fraud “Mr. Mathias Larkin
for several days after his defalcations were known.
That’s all right. But please serve it all round—
Mister; v ßill Sikes equally with Mister Jeremy

“ The Kaiser has sacrificed his heard to
please his wife.” From what has been heard of
the cranky Kaiser, one would rather have expected
him to sacrifice his wife to please his beard. But
he did it the other way round, as usual —and as a
birthday gift !
When a certain old and very well-estab"
fished solicitor in Sydney was appointed Post'
master-General, the news astounded the clerks in
the office, one of whom lost his billet by exclaim-

to write a minute !”.
Captain Maun, the Victorian Naval Com-
mandant who insisted on “full beards, or a clean
shave,” is retiring in favor of Captain White, au
Imperial officer of about five and forty. White’s
ideas on the subject of hair will be duly announced
when he arrives in March next.
Sir Henry Parkes was once carefully
examining a Bulletin cartoon of himself. A
Colonial Secretary’s Office official courageously
remarked that the cartoon was awfully ugly.
“You may think so,” sniffed the ancient politi-
cian, “ but my wife thinks it insufficiently ugly.”
Mr. Matthias Larkin took a pretty long
“ trip”—he has been robbing his building society
for the last four years. And, by the way, he left
off posting up the ledgers sometime in 1889, a
circumstance which goes to show that a board of
directors is a useful tiling to have about an office,
anyway.
Gov. Kintoro gives way to public opinion.
Innaniincka re-named by him “ Hopetoun ” as a
compliment to his friend the Victorian Governor,
is again called by its native appellation. Kintore
says he didn’t know anything about the native
name, at which the Adelaide people ejaculate
“ Walker!”
Mrs. Major Rae, Sells’ charming little
midget, on matrimony: “People should not bo
sentimental before marriage ; after marriage is the
proper time to be sentimental.” She has been
married only ten months. The tiny woman, like
all her sex, “loves all sentimental books.” She
reads her Bible regularly. “Beulah” is her
favourite work.
Jamieson, quondam surveyor, one of the
lucky Broken-Hill Proprietary men, is working
his way up to being aA English country magnate,
and has a delightful estate in the vicinity of
Salisbury. He was recently married, and is

Premier Muuro shook his mane at the
Vie. Assembly the other night, and desired to
know whether the time of the ‘country ” was to
be trifled away in settling the holidays of civil
servants, and whether the exchequer could stand
another £5OOO for lengthening policemen’s holidays
from 12 to 21 days. But we always-thought a
policeman took a long vacation on his beat.
A very good portrait of Dr. Perry, first
Bishop of Melbourne, just deceased, is preserved
in the National Gallery. Nobody has been com-
missioned to put the last bishop (Goe) on canvas,
a matter which wants .seeing, to without delay.
As a specimen of what bishops could occasionally
look like in the last days of proud prelatical institu-
tions, Goe’s picture would make future genera-
tions sit up and rub their eyes.
Sir Henry Parkes has always been a fond
admirer of lovely woman. So long ago as 1851,
when he wore no hair on his face, ho was called
upon to toast “The Ladies of x\ustralia.” “I
pine at this moment,” he stuttered, “for some
power of eloquence, some word of electric might
and influence, to speak out the fervour of my
admiration and the depth of my reverence for the
lofty and angelic character of a virtuous woman.”
Precise morning paper cablegram :
It is officially announced that Prince George of Wales
has reached the convalescent stage of ins illness.
Fancy having all that officially flashed per official
cable! Presumably George has been only
officially ill. And he can’t get well without official
sanction. And he’ll never die until he officially
pegs out. We feel officially tired of this official
slush.
An Adelaide ’Tlser reporter who inter-
viewed Rudyard Kipling was told by that fashion-
able lounger, as he sipped his light wine and
breathed out his fragrant cigar, that what the
working man in Australia wanted was 15 hours
hard work a day. Kipling was born and bred in
India, among niggers, and was probably wet-
nursed by a nigger woman. He is a nigger-driver
and has no business olf the chain in a white man’s
country.
After all, the Divine Sara is not a
thoroughbred Frenchwoman. Worse than all, the
cross is a German one. Someone has fished out
her certificate of birth, from which it appears that
the Queen of Tragedy is the daughter of a Berlin
Jewess, who was employed as a sempstress in the
Quartier Latin, Who her father was is not said.
Sara owes her education to a rich financier, who
sent her to a convent at Versailles and defrayed
the cost.
An effusive Tasmanian lady is very wroth
with the Hobart Mercury for libelling Albert
Edward in a cable. Lord Salisbury was reported
to have “regretted the Prince of Wales no longer
Wore unspotted the robe of royalty.” The error is
excusable if the sub-editor received, as probably
lie did, the words —“Salisbury regretted Wales
no longer wore unspotted robe.” “Wales” was
New South Wales, and the “ unspotted robe ” was
the robe of Freetrade.
Alfred Deakin is more than likely to enter
a large legal firm in Melbourne, in consequence' of
the passage of the Legal Profe sions Amalgama-
tion Bill in Victoria, and, if certain negotiations
are concluded, he will retire from politics
and undertake all the Court work of that
firm. There is money in Alf.’s silveiy voice and
his rhythmic poweis of persuasion, and he is
getting more nondescript-ly Liberal in politics
every day. Agk doth work miracles, as the
Symist David might say.
Old Sir Frederick Whitaker, ex-Prcmier
of N.Z., who died the other day, was called the
Nestor of the Maoriland Parliament. He had
been 50 years in the colony, and from 184 G until
his death was connected with public affairs. He
was a queer-looking little man who wore decidedly
baggy pants, a shapeless coat, and a single eye-
glass. He had a long, thin, forensic-looking nose
and as keen an eye as ever shone out of human
skull. He had several sons, but the brightest of
all, Fred., who was also in Parliament, com-
mitted suicide some years back.
The S. M. Herald endorses Braconnier’a
encomium upon Stanley as a man who was in-
variably kind, merciful, and polite towards th e
African natives, but unutterably inconsiderate
and selfish as regards his own officers, “ready at
any moment to sacrifice any one of them to his
own safety,” arrogant, overbearing and unreason-
able. “ I have watched him,” quotes the Herald
from Braconnier, “smoking under his own tent
knowing all the time his officers had no tobacco,
and it would never occur to him to offer them a
pipe.” What a damning indictment! It is
evident Stanley is a true Exter Haul Christian,
and that as his friendly critic says, “You must
live a long time with him to understand him.”
Most people know of Gulgong, N.S.W.,
once the scene of a historic rush, and the centre of
a population numbering 100,000. A strange relic
of those feverish days, a woman locally known as
“ Cranky Mary,” the whilom sweetheart of one of
the tars of the Franklin Relief Expedition, now
strays about the district. The poor woman’s lover
was killed by the caving-in of a shaft, and the
bereavement blighted her reason. Carrying all
her property in a swag, and wearing her lover’s
Franklin medal on her neck, she begs her way
from station to station, from humpy to humpy.
When in need of rest, she pitches her tent, lays
her blankets on the ground, and “camps” until
sufficiently refreshed to resume her aimless wan-
derings.

Some native officers of the Calcutta Geolo-
gical Department recently applied for a holiday
on the straight ground that they were “suffering
from perspiration and a want of enthusiasm for
work.”
“ Very much intoxicated, but quite
capable,” is the latest police-court definition of
drunkenness. It comes from Brisbane and is the
sort of definition which enabled the Sydney police
to arrest Hewart for drunkenness, lock him up in
a cell with another drunkard (whom he killed) and
then have him hanged for the murder, which it
was claimed he committed in his sober senses and
of malice aforethought.
Why is it that death should come before
the allotted age of ‘ three score and ten,’ and why
so many millions of human beings never live to
three score and five, and why that not one in
every thousand lives to three score years? We
kill ourselves. Many interesting particulars are
found in tables of physiologists and writers on
hygiene. The eminent physiologists, Haller and
Buffon, present interesting particulars on the
subject of longevity. They treat it in two ways,
historical and physical. The historical side is the
recitation of all facts known of the naturally
ordinary and extreme duration of life, and the
physical aspect of the problem involves the con-
templation of the great natural phases of develope-
ment of the species, digestion, period of growth
and length of life.
Mankind pays too little attention to the warn-
ing voice of nature. Signs of approaching calamity
are unheeded, the disorganization of the affected
organ increases and after a time becomes insen-
sible, then no pain is felt and the sufferer is
deluded into the belief that he has shaken off the
disease. Nothing could be more erroneous or
dangerous, for the complaint has only passed on
the further stage towards the end and nature
ceases to send those warning aches and pains as
they were unnoticed when sent. The debility and
weakness increases however, and nervousness, loss
of appetite, and general languor comes on, and a
cold is caught in the kidneys, lungs or liver, and
another life is sacrificed to Bright’s disease, Con-
sumption, or some other serious and fatal disease.
Scoffers can talk as they like at the virtues claimed
for Clements Tonic, but even the most prejudiced
men know it is genuine and does possess merits
no other medicine ever did, as instanced in the
following case. “ For the past four years I have
been a great sufferer from severe pains in the back
and left side, being at times quite unable to do
any work or even walk about. I suffered in this
way until it became quite unbearable and in
February, 1889, I consulted a physician who
treated me for seventeen months, and during that
time I suffered the severest torture under his
treatment, and instead of improving, continued to
get worse, he said at last, ‘ I have done all I can
and you will never be better.’ This drove me to
despair and I went under another doctor’s treat-
ment for four months and took about 30 bottles of
medicine, but with no result. I was giving up all
hopes when I read of the wonderful cures effected
by Clements Tonic, and on my husband’s advice I
tried it, and after the use of only three bottles I
was quite a different woman. I have taken 15
bottles and feel as well and strong as ever, and
can do my work with ease and pleasure, whereas
it was a great trouble before using Clements
Tonic. I can now also walk for miles without
fatigue. Before taking this medicine I have often
suffered with Neuralgia for weeks at a time and
could never get any relief, but since taking
Clements Tonic, I have never had an attack of it
since, as a result of ray experience I have much
pleasure in recommending it to all afflicted. Mrs.
S. E. Baker, Swan-street, Morpeth, N.S.W.”
Reader: Is it any wonder interested people
should be jealous of Clements Tonic when its
patrons write such spontaneous praise as that?

what brings us similar letters. F. M. Clements,

Whichever way the verdict goes in the
Brisbane cause celebre, there v. ill be an appeal to
the Full Court. Now, Chief Justice Lilley is
hearing the case ; Judge Real is debarred, since,
before his elevation to the Bench, he had been
retained in the case; and Judge Harding is
related by marriage to one of the defendants.
Does the last-named fact bar Harding ? If so,
can Lilley sit as a Full Court by himself ? Then
will Lilley as a Full Court be a satisfactory critic
upon the judgment of Lilley as a simple Court ?
Suppose Lilley in his Full capacity reversed
judgment, and Lilley in his individual capacity
as a member of the Full Court upheld judgment,
and then Full Lilley, as Full Chairman of the
Full Court, gave a Full casting-vote in favour of a
reversal, accepting the written dissent of Empty
Lilley in his Empty capacity as a member of the
Emptifull Court, why—but we wander, we fancy.
* * *
It is understood in Brisbane that the Fnil
Court did not meet last week on its regular day,
because the fourth son of the Chief Justice chose
that particular Wednesday for getting married.
In other words—of this be so, and certainly two
Supreme'Court Judges were at the wedding—the
business of suitors, to attend to which the Judges
are handsomely paid, must be postponed, no
matter at what cost and inconvenience to said
suitors, because a lovesick young man feels that
he must be, like Polly Pluck, “married on a
Wed-nes-dee.”

It would appear that the fashionable
audience which, within the last 12 months,

As there seems tc be some difficulty anent
the British jurisdiction in the Melba divorce-case,
the unhappy pair ought to come to Australia and
fight out the issue. It would be a godsend to the

with J. C. Williamson as to the season’s expenses.

The conjugal life of an Australian actress
will, it is said, soon form the subject of an enquiry
in the Divorce Court. A year and a half ago this
lady married a glittering personage whose father,
long since dead, amassed a large fortune as a
speculator. The marriage was denied at first by
the actress’s guardian, but certain alleged truths
have leaked out in an alleged sort of way, and the
wealthy husband’s people are resolved that the
marriage shall be annulled.

Much fuss has been made about requiring

ing his parliamentary vote on a Saturday.

To preserve the legal enclosure a little
more strictly, new regulations for LL.B. degree
were introduced at the beginning of the year at

started the course only one managed to get
thmmrh the first year’s examination which has just
finished.

In S.A. they have a cheerful insolvency
law. Insolvents who are suspected of having
swallowed the silver spoons, or of having buried
the cash-box at midnight, or of having defrauded
their creditors by a fraudulent preference for their
mother-in-law, can be dealt with in three ways.
They can be tried by a jury and sentenced up to
seven years ; or the court can say it is satisfied an
offence has been committed, and can sentence to a
maximum of three years, or the court can say that
it suspects an offence lias been committed, and can
imprison the insolvent until the suspicion fades
away from the mind of the court, which may be
after the death of the bankrupt. One insolvent
has been in prison for three years already under
this suspicion clause, and is no nearer having a
charge laid against him than he was at the
beginning. A private member of the S.A. Par-
liament has brought in a Bill providing that when
■an insolvent has been in prison upon suspicion for
a year, somebody must either lay a charge against
him or else he must be let loose. The Government
and the lawyers of the House strongly oppose the
Bill.

Among the details of the big divorce-case in
which the Countess Russell sought to divorce her
husband of but a year and a-half, it is mentioned
that the Countess “had been limited to six
cigarettes a day.” Another sidelight on the
recent!y-developed habits of English society.
* # #
The result of the Russell separation suit,
just concluded in Loudon, is one more illustration
of the wretched incompleteness of the English
divorce laws. The case reeked with nastiness, and,
judging from the necessarily skeletonic narrative
told by the cables, its mainspring appears to
have been that, swayed by the hallucinations
of hysteria, an imaginative woman of low mind
accused her husband of unspeakable offences
intended to make him appear loathsome in the
eyes of man. Countess Russell’s own counsel
publicly withdrew the most horrifying of the
charges. Naturally, she failed in her spit against
Earl Russell. Right here, one would expect some
relief for the husband from the Divorce laws.
Yet, after being accused by his wife of unnatural
offences, he must, according to the laws of Eng-
land, continue to love, honour, and protect the
lady who may, for utter charity’s sake, be
designated “ the patient.”
* * #
The ovation given after the trial to Earl
Russell, by the members of the National Liberal
Club was either a demonstration of thankfulness
at a man’s escape from an hysterical woman, or
else a jubilate because a member of the aristocracy
had proved that he was not an irredeemable black-
guard.
THE NEW JOURNALISM.
“The wayzegoose of the SYDNEY MORNING HERALD, THE SYDNEY MAIL , and the ECHO was
held on Saturday. The dancing in the pavilion was marked by some graceful exhibitions illustra-
tive of special departments in the terpsichorean art, which were given by three sisters.” -Morning
Paper.

The wife of the “ world’s greatest ex-
plorer ” — vide Smythe—is one of the best of
women, for she believes in her husband. Bless
the women ! They are mostly the same, right down
to the poor Sydney drudge who, with broken nose
and shipwrecked aspect, tried to beg her husband
off last week after he had culminated a 10 years’
wickedness by disfiguring her for life. The un-
happy woman swore she did it herself -that she
was disgracefully drunk and fell against the
table. To try and save him she imperilled herself
and her immortal soul with the utterance of a
false mca culpa. No one can but say “Eheu !
elien ! ” The story is told in manifold pages of
Dickens’ novels. The faith of many women in their
husbands is implanted like the heart in cabbages.

A wedding in high life was celebrated at
Mackay, Q., quite recently, with unusual Mat.
The principal sacrifices and their friends wanted
the “ Wedding March ” at any price, but were too
loftily-minded to ask the lady organist. Higher
church officers always referred them back to the
organist, but pride prevailed, and the “Wedding
March ” was eventually tumtytwceblared outside
the church door, by a piano, a violin, and a
cornet, amidst the jeers of the wicked and the
perverse, assembled to see the two victims hand-
cuffed for life. Mackay is invincible when it’s in
earnest.
» * • -
Mr. “ Beehive ” Benjamin, one of Mel-
bourne’s undemonstrative millionaires, is on the
point of taking a second plunge into matrimony.
If the lady, who is comely and not too giddy-
girly, can persuade the happy man to celebrate
his nuptials by a few fits of munificence —such as
a joyous reduction of rents on his city properties
—she will do him a great service. At the present
moment Benjamin is far too rich to feel certain of
salvation, although he wears the white waistcoat
of a blameless life. Nobody seems to have any
tales to tell of how Benjamin (no relation of Sir
Bingy) met him in the street, in the hour of need
and pressed a bank note into his trembling hand.
As a convivialist he is not equal to the average
Hebrew, and he charges his army of tenants a
per cent, or two a week without attempting to
make them enjoy the joke. However, Cupid
may, perhaps, start this prudent embodiment of

A young man about Sydney town had an
unhealthy two minutes the other night on leaving
the theatre. A little super who fancied she had at
least secured a perfect gentleman who really did
love her, shammed sick on seeing him sole escort
of a soulful maiden, went off, drank a glass or two
of brandy, waited for him at the dress-circle
entrance and showed him up badly.

Extract from report of mining-manager of
Last Call mine, Cloncurry (Q.): —
Commencing at the entrance to the western crosscut,
Mr. Cape, by probing the wall with a knife, showed me
three small dabs of clay, two on the north side and one on
the south side, which, on being picked out and tested in
the agate mortar, gave wonderfully rich results in each
case, certainly over lOOozs. to the ton. This clay had the
appearance of having been placed there—
By the Almighty, dear friends.

A certain Brisbane solicitor, while on an
idle holiday round New Zealand, met and wooed
a much-admired red-headed angel. In due course
the lady arrives in Sydney on her way to Brisbane
—her trousseau prepared, her clothing all marked
with his initials. She waited, and at last received
a letter from him : “ So sorry, but she had misin-
terpreted his intentions ; he could never love her,
but would release her from her distressing posi-
tion, because it was the only honourable offer he
could make.” The lady declined, and went back
home.

THE STOCKMAN’S GRAVE.
A sighing breeze as the wattles wave,
And a wild, low cry of pain ;
A weird, dank spot round a sandy grave
Unsheltered from sun or rain ;
A stain of blood on the arid ground,
And the sign of a murderer’s ban—
All these in Australian verse I’ve found,
But seldom a living man.

Item on human ankles, from the London
Globe :
When a woman has ankles almost as thick as the
ordinary human neck, ought she to wear boots or shoes ?
In which do the said ankles look least dreadful ? There is
something to be said on both sides. The polish of the
kid in the boot advertises the liberal girth by attracting
the eye to them ; whereas the dull, sombre tone of black
silk stockings has the effect of diminishing the apparent
size. But then, hoots have a more restraining influence
than shoes, which allow superfluous flesh to boil over
their upper edges in a distracting way. Since woman
took to riding on the tops of onmibuses'the study of the
human ankle has been forced upon the reluctant spectator.
The majority cannot be described as otherwise than de-
pressing. The number of bony ankles is incredible—and
such bones ! They lean over towards each other on their
separate feet in the most aggressive way, and even in
boots print their profile on the outer leather with an
accuracy well worthy of a splendid cause. Pretty, slim
ankles are often seen, it is t»ue, but the proportion they
bear to the ugly ones is infinitesimally small.

Rev. J. Allen (Benalla, Vic.), determined
to augment the Bishop of Melbourne’s Fund, on
the Booth principle of “ self-denial,” proposes to
lead the van himself. He believes in whisky and
tobacco as God-sent gifts, for, saith he, “good
beer and good whisky are as much the creatures
of God as are good bread and good beef.” He is,
therefore, a “moderate drinker.” He further
believes, as an article of faith, that “tobacco was
created by the good Lord to be the solace of many
wearied and worried men.” Then comes the
challenge to his parishioners to do as he intends
to do, and put the saved moneys into the Bishop’s
Hat: —
But I hereby promise and vow—and all you who hear
me are witnesses—that for twelve months from this
Sunday (if I am spared so long) I will not take any
alcoholic drink as a beverage, and I will smoke no tobacco
in any form, except a little on Sunday nights, unless
specially and peremptorily ordered to do so by a medical
adviser.
There! “As a beverage!” And just a little on
Sunday nights ! Candour and earnestness and
simple mindedness. Come out of the whirl of
shams, Parson Allen.

At the recent Conference of the Women’s

At the little sea-coast town of New
Brighton (M.L.) there are long ridges of sand
which have a strange habit of shifting from place
to place, like itinerant dust-heaps or wandering
ash-mounds. They are always rolling, drifting,
and changing; where there is a hill one week
there is a valley the next, and the level spots
climb up to the tops of the ridges, and the hills
climb down on to the level beach again, and every-
thing is uncertain, sad, and transitory. Some-
where about a month ago a family party of five
ladies Went out to bathe in these regions, and, as
it happened, they knew nothing of this local
peculiarity. They utilised a convenient recess
among the sandhills as a dressing-room, and
having climbed into correct bathing costumes,
they went out into the great Pacific and had a
royal time. But when they came out a great sur-
prise fell upon them like a man falling off
a high tower, tor there wasn’t a stitch of
raiment in sight. Neither was there a
single human being on the landscape far
or near, and there was not one solitary
footprint to show where the marauder
had come and gone; and when a distracted
parent in bathing costume climbed up a sandhill
and looked out upon the dry land and the great,
damp sea, there wasn’t a clue on the horizon any-
where. Some of them thought that the clothes
had been carried off by an eagle, though it seemed
eminently improbable that an eagle would have
come back to scrape up the last collar, and to
take away the very last hat and boot, unless he
was an exceedingly economical bird ; another
theory was that the togs had been destroyed by
lightning, and one damp girl, shivering on the
ADVICE TO YOUNG LADIES.
Be kind to the opposite sex,
Yet not too familiar, young misses ;
Take care not to cuddle their necks.
Nor curl their moustaches with kisses.
If mashers get spoony and talk
In a strain that is tender and pleasing,
Then request them to come for a walk
And discuss the cold ethics of squeezing.
Be kind to the opposite sex
And give them a show to make offers
It is best for a girl to annex
A boy who has gold in his coffers.
But when you have answered him “yes,”
And Jack goes to hug his Ameliar,
Why, object to an ardent caress
On the ground that it’s drefful familiar
Be kind to the opposite sex,
For men need your moral assistance,
But give their warm rhapsodies checks,
And bid ’em make love at a distance.
A trim little ankle but mocks
At passionate sighs unavailing,
So add a fresh “ tuck ” to your frocks
Until in the dust they are trailing.
Be kind to the opposite sex,
As Mrs. O’Donnell exhorts you,
Don’c put on a bustle to vex
The soul of the stranger who courts you.
Belong to the White Cross and Shield,'
And frown at the girl who tight laces,
And keep human nature concealed
’Neath a mask of the straightest of faces.

We ask you, therefore, to coiile to the Entrepot of the

of the beautiful in form and colour.
The stock is as huge as Olympus, the values surpass

without a parallel.
The singularity of the price-list ostracises all other
competitors.

Now that the legal professions have been
amalgamated in Victoria by Act of Parliament,
the old, hard-shell barristers are taking violent
steps to preserve what they call their “status.”
They have formed a solemn league and covenant,
described by themselves as the “ Bar Association
of Victoria,” and by other people, no doubt, as
the Devil’s Ring, the members of which pledge
themselves to have no dealings with any solicitor
who practises as a barrister as provided by the
Act, and not to recognise or consult or associate
in any capacity with any barrister who also acts
as a solicitor, or who accepts briefs from any boy-
cotted solicitor. In other words, the league is an
illegal association, formed to violently abrogate
an Act of Parliament, to interfere with the liberty
of the subject, and to intimidate men while in
pursuit of their lawful calling. Under a certain
Act of George IV., which is always raked up
when workmen instead of barristers practise
intimidation and go on the boycott, a good many
leading legal authorities are now liable to be
seized by the police and sent to break road-metal
in Pentridge, and doubtless that code which hits
the rich and the poor alike will look after them
promptly. Yah !

The day Sells’ Circus arrived in Sydney,
and within an hour of the arrival, a seedy-looking
parson struck the management for a free-pass.
There were three stern, hard-featured, business-
like men superintending the landing of the pro-
perties, and the haggard preacher hovered round
and round them for a while with an anxious
expression on his countenance. At last he dodged
up to the principal boss of the concern, and said
something in an apologetic whisper in Ins ear, and
that official responded cheerfully, and in a voice
that could be heard half-way down the street:
“ Certainly, sir, certainly, O YES! We’ll pass
you in free with the greatest pleasure. Come right
round any time, and ask for me at the gate.”
There was a capacious grin all down the street,
and the free-pass pastor fled in confusion. A few
days after that we saw the back view of an old,
greenish-black, clerical tail-coat that was hovering
on the stairs of the Theatre Royal; it was
evidently the same parson, and he was plainly in
search of another free-pas-c Last Monday week
we wandered round to hear Stanley, and in front
of us, doddering up the steps of the Centenary
Hall, we encountered the rear aspect of the same
flapping coat—or else its twin brother—and saw
the same thin legs dodging underneath it. The
owner fished out a card and presented it to
the Much-Travelled Smythe, and flapped his
gaunt paws at Smythe, and was evidently
laying the matter fully before him. The
Much - Travelled shook his head, and said
the request was “ most unusual.” Then
the parson’s sad coat - tail flickered more
drearily in the breeze, and his legs took an
entreating aspect, but Smythe stated that the
seats were mostly taken, and tried to go away.
The parson fled round Smythe, and presented
sundry new aspects of the case to him, and pointed
excitedly with his long finger to his card, and
backed the manager up against the wall, but
Smythe only looked reticent. Last of all the
preacher settled down, and talked to Smythe for
ten minutes in one ceaseless flow, as if he had
taken the plug out of a barrel of conversation
and let the contents fly, and at the end of that
tune the great man collapsed. The scene closed
with a seedy expounder entering triumphantly “ on

he could get.

In New South Wales, it appears, things
are now so arranged that a woman can no longer

This is a remarkably good thing for the father'
and possibly for other fathers as well. It has*

his pious enemy by getting consignments of
Evening News babies at intervals, and register-
ing them as the illegitimate offspring of—well,,

The World’s Fair.
Few persons among the population of Victoria*
will, we premise, hold with Mr. Munro’s tacit
refusal to benefit the colony by arranging for the-
exhibits of its products in the great World’s Fair
to be held in Chicago early in 1893. We badly
require the extension of the comparatively small
exchange of products now carried on between
Victorian markets particularly, and the markets
of the western slope of the American continent..
To this end, if the exhibit of this country’s goods,
in the World's Fair jrere authorised, much goodl
would accrue. At present, the Premier’s action
resembles the procedure of the hopelessly foolish
Conservative merchant who refuses to advertise*
his wares at all, when his policy should be exactly
the reverse. For ourselves we have not the*
slightest intention of taking down our sign by
curtailing our advertising. This, or any other of:
the forms of advertising we indulge in is not
intended for the people who have already used our
medicines. Every bottle sold is the best
advertisement the purchaser could have, and in
nine cases out of ten he has told his neighbour..
But in the daily increase of our population this,
writing is for the man or woman who has not yet
used or heard of our remedies. Once an article
or a pamphlet issued by us reaches the person for
whom it is intended, or to whom it is directed 1 ,,
the missive has no doubt made its mark, but in-
directly the advertisement goes on forever so to*
speak, or the ball is kept rolling by the in-
formation which passes from neighbour to*
neighbour or from friend to friend. They alll
know when they get hold of a good medicine, andl
a good thing bears being talked about. As a>.
matter of fact wo deliver either by post or
messenger a copy of our annual pamphlet to every
house to be found in all these Australasian
colonies and New Zealand, and this is additional!
to all the other systems of giving publicity to our
wares we adopt. These advertisements all allude*
in some form or other to the peculiar cir-
cumstances that in the possession of the patent;
for Warner’s safe cure we are honored to become*
the means, if they will only accept it, of the*
restoration to normal health of every man or
woman suffering from the effects of kidney or
liver disease, if Warner’s safe remedies are taken
by them as directed. We are happy to know
that our. various remedies are rapidly becoming as
well-known as were treacle and brimstone in the
days of our boyhood, and that, becoming the
household medicine, they receive in many houses
in the country the place of honor near the kitchen
clock.

and beautifies the hair, and prevents its fading or
turning gray.

At Freeraantle (W.A.), the other day, a
married woman, mother of two children, eloped
with a boy 16 years of age. She was subsequently
arrested on a charge of child desertion.
Delicate, ailing women should read this:
Mrs. M. O‘Connell writes from Windsor, Oct. 1,
1801:—For many years I have been a victim to
palpitation of the heart and extreme nervousness,
and was induced by a friend to try “ Marshall’s
Tonic Nervine,” when to my joyful surprise a
complete change took place. 1 became once more
sound and well, my whole system becoming
renovated, and appetite and digestion good,
therefore I cannot help adding my testimony to
the wonderful qualities of this medicine. I know
it snatched me from the grave.
GRATEFUL ATHLETES.
The followingspontaneous expressions of athletic
gratitude are taken from the recent issue of the
Manchester Athletic News :
Mr. E. E. Painter (of London Athletic Club
and Ranelagh Harriers), 55, Einsboro’-road, South
Kensington, writes; “I have been suffering
from a sprained tendon for the past three months,
and have tried every remedy I could think of, but
none have done me any good. About a month
ago I was recommended by a fellow-athlete to try
St. Jacobs Oil, which I applied at once, and it did
me so much good that I shall in a few days
commence running again. Shall recommend it to
all my fellow-athletes as being the best remedy I
have ever tried.”
Mr. G. Smith, of Handsworth Friary Football
Club, 18, Carlyle-road, Handsworth, Birmingham,
says : —“Not long ago I received a severe sprain
in my ankle while on the football field, which
wholly disabled me from walking. The ankle
was much swollen, and very painful. Learning
of the virtue of St. Jacobs Oil in such cases, I
procured a bottle and applied the contents
regularly for one week to the ankle, by which
time the swelling and pain had wholly disappeared,
and I was able to walk. I have also found the
oil a most excellent remedy for toothache and
headache. I have, therefore, no hesitation in
recommending the oil to football players, as well
as all persons suffering from pain.”
Mr. Thomas Charles Pallinger, the well-known
bicycle rider, of 16, High-street, Lewisham, not
only knows how to ride a bicycle, but he knows
the right sort of an embrocation to use after bard
riding. He says, in referring to a strained leg,
“ I have found St. .Jacobs Oil has done my leg a
power of good. I shall continue to reconnmnd
your valuable embrocation to my fellow-cyclists,
as I consider, it a splendid article for rubbing
down while training.” The Bicycling News,
April 23, 1887, also says : “Mr. Pallinger, of the
Catford, asks ns to thank the gentleman who
recommended St. Jacobs Oil to him.”
The fire brigade of the city of Birmingham has
excellent state of efficiency. The men
are exposed to many dangers, and their arduous
work often brings about physical suffering. Chief
Engineer John Bellhouse, and Firemen Josiah
Bennett, Thomas Fidoe, Wm. Maese, Wm. Shaw,
and John Brittill write that they received great
benefit from the use of St. Jacobs Oil in cases of
severe pains in the back and knees, also tender
feet and other ailments. The wives of several
members of the depaitment also say that in their
case a few applications of the oil cured tooth and
face-ache.

HOW TO IMPROVE YOUR FORTUNE.
If you are not up to time in all your engage-
ments, small as well as great, people soon begin to
lose confidence in you. A trifling sum invested in
a Waterbury Watch will help to save you from
being frequently misjudged, and may be the
means of materially improving your fortunes. It
is the very trifles of life on which success or failure
generally hinge. And if anything goes wrong
with the watch the owner has only to take or send
it to the offices of the Waterbury Watch Company,
at 56, Margaret-street, where it can be repaired
at a cost according to its requirements, but in no
case exceeding 2s. 6d., unless by mutual consent.
The cost of transmission by post or parcel delivery
on watches sent from the country must be pre-
paid, and a sufficient amount to cover return
charges and cost of repairs forwarded at the same
time. If sent in the box in which the Waterbury
is sold the postage fee (including registration) is
6d. each way.

Our great speciality this season is our “ EXHIBITION ” Optical Lantern. This apparatus, we beg to submit, has no equal for value and good points. First and foremost, it is not a toy, but an
ideal lantern for its purpose. It is designed to supply a want, and is a really good, serviceable instrument, suitable for lecturers, clergymen, public school teachers, and private persons, who wish to amuse
their friends and the youngsters thoroughly. The “EXHIBITION” Set consists of a magnificent Lantern in japanned iron, as per sketch (but the block gives no idea of its good points), burning a

Carrier for carrying Lightning Dissolving Carrier. It is fitted in ebonised case, which acts as a stand —lantern screwing on the lid of it. Dimensions of lantern when in case, 18m. by izin. by 7in. These

Christmas Shopping 1 and other Matters.
What form shall our Xmas gifts take this
year? The question, if unanswered, grows more
and more irriportunate as December days begin to
lengthen and the festive season approaches. Let
tndSe who are undecided make haste to visit the
establishment of Messrs. Elkington, George-
street. ! The name alone of this far-famed firm of
jewellers and goldsmiths suggests a chapter out of
tjre “Arabian Nights.” Jewellery, faultless alike
in Resign and workmanship, is here displayed.
Diamonds ! Well, to buyers we would say, go to
Messrs. Elkington and see for yourselves. Rings,
bracelets, necklets, parures—the choice is endless,
and each separate article is so beautiful in itself
that intending purchasers must feel puzzled how
to make a selection. A marvellous display of
plated goods is perhaps not the least attractive
feature at Messrs. Elkington’s. Artistic in form
and cunningly wrought, the electro-plate on view
is distinctly a revelation. Then there are gongs,
sonorous of boom and handsomely mounted. In
fact, at Elkington’s there is everything to delight
the eye and loosen the purse-strings. As a Xmas
gift emporium it is therefore unrivalled.

Messrs, J. F. Collins & Co. (late Summer-
field & Co.), 237 and 239 Pitt-street, wish their
friends and patrons to know that they are at
present holding a special clearing sale which will
be continued until the end of the month. This
sale will enable customers to purchase their goods
for less than English cost price, and as all the
articles are marked in plain figures, intending
purchasers who are inclined to doubt the fact that
such bargains are being offered at Xmas time, can,
by visiting Messrs. Collins & Co., see for them-
selves. The building has of late been improved in
every way, and it is now one of the most spacious
and cheerful shops in the city. A special feature
is made of the dressmaking department in this
establishment, which is conducted under Mrs.
Collins’ immediate supervision. The display
of millinery is really very fine, and the price's
of the daintiest hats and bonnets, surprisingly low.
Special attention has been bestowed upon the
ladies’ underclothing department, whilst blouse
jackets and Henley shirts abound in all patterns
and sizes. Excellent prints and cambrics in all
the new shades are being sold at from 3s. lid. per
dozen yards, and dozens of useful remnants are
offered at half-price. The chance of procuring
parasols in the latest shapes at cost-price should
not be lost, and it is not every day that six-
button tan kid gloves can be bought for Is. 3d.
per pair. The men’s and boys’ departments are
well patronised, which is no wonder, seeing that
the prices are below those of any other house in
the city. Where else can be obtained a boy’s
washing, striped, Galatea suit for 2s. fid. ? In the
tailoring department it is announced that men’s
tweed and serge sac-suits are made to order for
50s. and upwards, and washing ties in the most
tasteful patterns are sold for sd. each. The
economical housekeeper is strongly recommended
to visit the establishment of Messrs. J. F. Collins
and Co., Pitt-street.

Maclardy’s well-known Fancy Goods and
Stationery Emporium, of 319 George-street, is
replete with an enormous stock of appropriate
gifts for the coming season. As it has been
decided to relinquish the Fancy Goods business,
exquisite articles, such as dressing-cases, albums,
&c., which would make most appropriate Xmas
gifts, are being offered at a cost below English
wholesale prices. A beautiful dressing-case in
apple-blossom plush, mounted in nickel silver,
and containing all the requisites of the toilet-
table, brushes with embossed nickel silver backs,
&0., &c., for the ridiculously small sum of £2.
Plush albums, with patent clasps and strong
nickel and gilt bindings, are almost given away.
Xmas both comic and sentimental, are
another feature in this establishment, and it is a
well-known fact that the latest novelties in all
things pertaining to stationery are to be had at
Maclardy’s. Lose no time, but make your pur-
chases without delay, as the sale is not of long
duration.

The Sydney agents for that most wonder-
ful medicine, Pad a id’s Microbe Killer, have been
obliged, owing to increase ol business, to remove
from 319 George-street to more commodious pre-
mises in 92 Market-street, near Pitt-street, where
the “Cure for All Diseases” may be obtained,
together with pamphlets in which its history and
discovery are duly set forth ; Dr. Radam’s mode
of treatment and other interesting information.
The numerous cures effected by the Microbe
Killer prove it to be the greatest discovery of the
age.

The Metropolitan Hairdressing Saloon,
331 George-street, opposite Paling’s, is one of the
most attractive saloons in Sydney. A comfort-
able room is set aside for ladies, where they can
have their hair dressed in the most approved
fashion. This firm enjoys a wide reputation for
making up hair and wigs of all descriptions.
Another speciality is an excellent hair-wash,
which they manufacture themselves from a valu-
able French receipt. This wash is called Eau-de-
fee, and it is said that its effect upon the hair is
something marvellous. After a few applications
in accordance with the directions on each bottle,
gray hair resumes its original colour. It possesses
no harmful properties—in fact, it is the hair-wash
of the day, and only needs a trial to prove its
efficacy.

A visit to “ Haddock’s,” George-street,
will repay those in search of Christmas gifts.
Here the tourist-case is to be obtained, purses
also in endless variety. Beautiful Christmas-
cards which tempt the buyer to send another and

friends. All the newest annuals, and an extensive
collection of choicely-bound books suitable for
presentation to all sorts and conditions of men,
women, and children.

Sydney by the American Corset Company, 14G
Clarence-street, of Madam Dean’s Spinal-sup-
porting, Shoulder Brace and Health-preserving
Corset. Many of the most prominent men in
Europe and America recommend its adoption as
the only corset that will support the spine, pre-
serve the shape and figure, and, at the same time,
give ease and comfort. This corset is a combination
of a shoulder brace and spine-supporting corset, and
while combining the benefits of both is extremely
simplified into a first-class corset in every respect,
whilst the price has been established at so reason-
able a figure as to put it within the reach of all.
Another advantage the corset possesses is that it
is laced at each side just under the shoulder, thus
protecting the spine from draught. The corset is
constructed of bone, Mexican cysel and coutil. It
is closely protected by patents in all countries,
and only sold in Sydney through the American
Corset Company, 140 Clarence-street, and their
canvassers.

Messrs B. Way and Company, 448 George-
street have put forth a grand show of drapery and
millinery for the Christinas season at their
temporary premises. Upstairs, in the delightfully
hght and spacious showrooms, the largest variety
of millinery m Sydney is displayed. Hats and
bonnets of all shapes and sizes, trimmed and
untrimmed, are offered to tae customer at prices
exceedingly moderate. A splendid lino of lace
capes and mantles, and perfect gems of ladies
and childrens’, costumes are also shown here.
Neither kve the,young folks been forgotten, for
Messrs. E. Way and Company have provided an
assortment of “such lovely dolls” and other toys
which should cause their eyes to glisten with
delight. Pictorial fire-screens, and novelties for
Christmas presents, being novel both in shape
and design, meet the eye at every turn. Down-
stairs the beautiful dress fabrics, silks,
parachutes, silk and chiffon handkerchiefs, &c.,
&c., call forth the deepest admiration, being well
selected. Our advice is, pay this firm a visit and
your time will not be lost. For all articles of
mourning it is a well-known fact that Way’s is
the establishment par excellence in Sydney.

Toys! Toys! Toys! Mr. Fourth, of
the Sydney Arcade, has evidently made up his
mind that the youngsters shall want for nothing
this Christmas in the way of toys and games of
all descriptions. Mr. Fourth imports direct from
the manufacturers and has several thousands of
pounds of reserve stock at his warehouse in 331
Kent-street, therefore, as there is no middleman to
come in for his share of the profits, these toys are
sold at extremely low prices. For instance, a
real steam-engine is sold for 2s. lid., and a magic-
lantern for about the same sum. The number of
new games being shown here is legion, whilst the
dolls are in such multitudes that the wonder is
where all the live dolls are coming from to annex
them. Perambulators and rocking-horses are
here in all shapes and sizes. Indeed, Mr. Eeurth
has put forth his very best efforts in effectively
catering for the young folks this year.

Mr. F. W. Wyatt’s Oriental Bazaar, 201
Pitt-street, although up-stairs, is well worth a
visit to those in quest of Xmas gifts ; indeed, once
in the Bazaar, there is so much to be seen that
the visitor feels extremely disinclined to descend
from Jap-land to the bustling streets below,
Exquisite Japanese vases are here on view, at all
prices, lovely tea-pots, plates, in bewildering
variety. Japanese draperies for windows and
doors in every conceivable pattern ; while set out
on long tables is a special display of pretty things,
at prices ranging from Is. to 25.; then we have
brackets, photo-frames, and fire-screens in novel
and graceful patterns, and which, being made from
Mr. Wyatt’s own designs, are only to be seen in
this show-room. Mr. Wyatt’s fame as a decorator
of reception-rooms, &c., grows apace.
* # *
Although Mr. Cree’s Fancy Goods Shop,
of 540 George-street, is as well and favourably
known as The Bulletin itself, casual customers
who merely drop in to purchase a few of the many
attractive goods shown in the windows, never
dream that by going upstairs into the show-rooms
they can see some of the very finest specimens of
Dresden china—seeing is not always believing, for
the dainty little Dresden figures clad in silk and
lace are so realistic that nothing short of a
“ touch ’’ will convince that they are all china,
The lace is specially fine. It is not too much to
say that Mr . Cree shows in his warehouse one of
le fj nes fc collections of china in Sydney. In the
toy-room are to be seen all kinds of novelties,
whilst the show of imitation jewellery in all the
latest patterns is simply marvellous. Brooches of
tasteful design are marked at prices from Is.
upward. Mr. Cree lias spent much time and
trouble in his selection of Christmas cards this
year, those at present on view being all in
excellent taste,
* * *
There are many boot-shops in Sydney, but
a t Whiddon’s, Pitt-street, there is a concatenation
of circumstances which give it the pre-eminence
over all others. In this establishment one has an
excellent choice at moderate cost comfort,
civility and prompt attention. In a word, if one
desires to be well and cheaply shod, it is to
Whiddon’s one must go to select—that the visitor
will become a purchaser is a foregone conclusion,
# # #
At Messrs. Cains & Co.’s Co-operative
Drugstore, 78 King-street, drugs of aU descrip-
tions can be purchased at London prices. Cains’
Neuralgia Powders possess large curative powers
and should prove a blessing to those who suffer
f ro m this painful affliction. They are highly-
recommended by the medical faculty. The
“Little Tonic Liver Pills,” which are also manu-
factored by this firm, are capital in their effects and
a re, in consequence of their minute size, easy to
swallow. Messrs. Cains & Co. have also invented
a cure for toothache, which they call, “Cains’
Dentiline.” It has never been known to fail as a
pain-killer. Cain’s price list will be posted free
to all parts of the Australias upon application for
the same.

D bcome our knowledge that bant a
Claus, Esquire, has telegraphed from the North
Pole that he intends to take up his quarters this
Xmas at Eoxall’s Leviathan Toy Warehouse in
Pitt-street, Sydney. Santa Claus_ is a wise man,
for here every conceivable toy is kept, from a
spinning-top to a rocking-horse (almost life-size).
To quote Artemus Ward, the show of toys at
Foxall’s is onparalleled.

Teeth will ache, even at Xmas-time, and
many a Xmas dinner is sent away untasted in
consequence of the racking pain produced by a
decayed tooth. Why not, while there is yet
time before the festive season is fairly in, go to
Mr. J. I. Marshall, of the Sydney Arcade, King
and George-streets who will, in his own skillful
way, remove the offending grinder before there is
time to say Christmas . Mr. Marshall not only
removes teeth, but also replaces them in the most
natural manner.
# * *
At Messrs. John Brush and Sons’, harness
and saddlery emporium, George-street, the
Christmas season has not been forgotten. The
excellence of theleather goods of this establishment
is too well-known to need comment, nevertheless,
it may be mentioned that, in the way of small
goods such as ladies’ bags, purses, &c., a splendid
selection has been made in view of the Christmas
season.

A Townsville (N.Q.) editor the other day
congratulated Rev. W. A. Smith, upon being in
Townsville, “ in connection with a bigamy case.”
Luck !
A drunk, also charged with obscene
language, at South Brisbane, told the Bench that
he was “an Oxford man, and I need hardly say>
your worship, that a University man would not
have to resort to such language in order to clearly
express his ideas. ” But ho got there all the same —
.£2.
The editor of Wagga Wagga Advertiser
must be a real gentleman. While every other
country editor was ripping out tangled essays on
the budget, the deficit, finances generally, free-
trade, or protection, he calmly sp'ashed out for
the benefit of his readers an editorial on “Mutton
and Wine.”
Howard, the noseless N.B.W. hangman,
went in disguise to Dubbo to choke Mallalieu.
Ho wore a wax nose and spectacles for the
occasion. It is to be hoped Mr. Howard main-
tained the disguise when treating his patient.
Think of being strapped up after a light breakfast
by a six-foot man without a nose !
The Bishop of Dover (Eng.; declares that
out of every 1000 convicts in Pentonville prison
757 had been Sunday-school attendants ; at the
Leeds Borough Gaol, 230 out of 252 ; while the
Bishop tried to trace 100 of his own Sunday-
school children, but could only find 77 —“of these,
two only were attending church regularly, and 39
were confirmed drunkards.”
Dear Bulletin, —The other day at New-
castle, N.S.W., a man visited his landlord’s house
and paid his rcnt--£l, which was placed on the
table. While both talked, in walked a goat and
swallowed the note. The tenant holds that he
has paid his rent ; the landlord won’t give a
receipt. The tenant says “ Kill your goat ; he's
got the rent.” But the landlord fancies that the
goat may have digested the money into unpassable
currency and declines. Who is right?—A.B.
[The facts as stated being admitted, the landlord
has to bear the loss. Ed. B.]
Dear Bulletin, —Your par re “ Terrible Billy ”
and Lord Henry Phipps is not quite correct. In ’75 I
started from Bulloo Downs with cattle for Melbourne, the
young patrician named being in my employ as an assist-
ant. In due time we got to Bairanald. Leaving the
cattle a short distance from the township I dropped in to
•see about crossing and to get supplies. We visit!d
Young’s puh. for a drink, and, of course, went to
the “ swells' ” end of the mansion. Seated at breakfast
were old Mitchell, the P.M., Dr. Mein, of Moolpar, on the
Edwards, and some others whom 1 did not know. The
man of Law, not liking our personal appearance, sat up,
and snorted: “Hum! Hal! Hi!!! are you aware
this is no place for you fellows to be drinking, where
vjentlemen are having breakfast?” I looked at him and
smiled, but said nothing. Telling Lord H. Phipps to stay
till I returned, I went over the way to the store, did my
business, and returned to see how they were getting on,
when I found the scene changed. They were drinking
champagne and “my lord ”-ing it fast and furiously.
It appears that.after I left, old M, looked up
and told my companion that I had cleared
and that lie had - better follow suit. Ho did not
like to be fired out and he didn't want them to have it all
their own way. so, pulling out a card (it was his railway-
pass) he handed it to the ruler of drunks 1 It produced
the desired effect. Apologies came from all hands—.
“ Very sorry, hut really you know,” &c. However, 1 got
my cattle over, and when about four miles on my way I
was overtaken by the local sergeant with a request to
allow my sprig of nobility to stay a day or two, to which
I assented, and he had a high old time, as he didn’t over-
take the cattle till near Swan Hill. I asked the mail-
driver how my drover was getting on. He replied that
the last he saw of him he was helping old Mitchell to try
some drunks who got excited on the occasion. Lord
Henry is, or was not long ago, located on a station of his
own out on the Logan, in the North of Queensland. He
wasn’t half a had sort, as lords go.— Drover.

Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Is everywhere recommended as the best rem-
edy for the cure of scrofula, scrofulous and
cancerous humors, chronic catarrh, eczema,
boils, pimples, sores, and all disorders origina-
ting in impure blood. It neutralizes and elimi-
nates the acids that cause rheumatism, gout,
and dropsy. It regulates the liver and kidneys,
gives tone to the stomach, increases the appe-
tite, aids digestion,
Cures Dyspepsia,
and makes the weak strong. No other blood
purifier is composed of such carefully selected,
highly concentrated, and skilfully united in-
gredients. For nearly half a century this prep-
aration has, in both hemispheres, been the
standard tonic and strengthening medicine. It
is universally approved by the medical profes-
sion, and benefits the enfeebled system at all
seasons of the year.

with hereditary or scrofulous taints, they are equally suc-
cessful. Everything about them invites confidence. They
are absolutely pure, and may be used on the youngest
infant. They are agreeable to the most refined and sen-
sitive. They are speedy, economical, and unfailing.

ballot the Government couldn’t make them vote its

No. XV.—The Preliminaries of Overseer
Franke’s Pegging-Out.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Philip Franke was his name, and his
grade was Overseer of the Outer Domain Gang.
Originally a drummer-boy in the 73rd Regiment,
he, by much musical beating of the taptoo and
reveille, and by a fine enthusiasm in the use of
the cat when a comrade was lashed to the hal-
berds in Barrack Square, had achieved promotion
in the regiment. He had won the sergeant's
stripes and with them the commendation of his
superiors and the hearty, undisguised hatred of
everyone —“Government labour,” soldier, or lower
class “ free,” over whom at any time he exercised
authority. A pleasant fellow to look at, save
that he was rather undersized, he had a round
chubbiness of feature which was suggestive of
Primeval Innocence and Uncorrupted Virtue. No
man could look more un-Systematic or more
cherubic ; and when Mr. Lewin, the distinguished
botanist and artist, was searching for models for
the group of angels he was painting for the lady
of his Excellency Governor Macquarie—Mrs.
Macquarie favoured Mr. Lewin with many com-
missions—it is not surprising to learn, firstly, that
Lieutenant-Colonel O’Connell promised to send
him some one from the Barracks who he thought
would serve Mr. Lewin’s purpose ; and, secondly,
that Sergeant Philip Franke was, in consequence,
depicted by the artist as reposing on a remarkably
neat arrangement of snowy cumuli.
The incident is mentioned here as demonstrating
the regard in which his officers held Franke, and
also as indicating the foundation for the wide-
spread convict belief that Franke would never get
any nearer heaven than those pictured clouds
would carry him.
# # #
Truth to say, the qualities which were
most generally manifested by Phil. Franke were
not such as to commend him to the loving
appreciation of the “ Government Labour,” or, of
the rank-and-file. And when on the 19th day of
March, 1814, it was known that Sergeant Franke
had received His Excellency’s special permission
to remain behind when his Regiment was relieved
by the 46th under Colonel Molle, there was a
wild break-out of hilarity in Barrack-square, and
a corresponding depresdon of spirits among the
out-labour passports. For in the same breath that
it was made known that Franke had received
Governor Macquarie’s permission, i t was announced
that he retired on pension to the Overseership of
the O.D. Gang.
His Excellency the Major-General’s farewell pro-
clamation to the 73rd was read out by the Brigade-
Major at morning parade. When the paragraph—
In adverting to their Services in this Colony, although
unhappily Events have occurred which must always
occasion the deepest Regret, as well to the Corps as to
the Major-General, it must be recollected that the Odium
attending those Acts of Depravity ought in Justice only
to extend to the Perpetrators of them,
was reached a murmur rolled through the ranks
“Acts o’ depravutty ! Th’ spyin’ o’ Sargeant
Frapke, th’ measley sot! ” The files on parade
had memories that at that particular moment were
not to be appeased by rounded periods of glowing
eulogy. His Excellency went on to express his
opinion that—
This Station lias not afforded the usual Field for
Military Glory, but, in as far as the industrious Exertions
of those Non-commissioned Officers and Privates who
could be spared from Military Duty have been concerned,
this Colony is much indebted for many useful Improve-
ments, which, but for the soldiers of the 73rd Regiment,
must have remained only in the Contemplation of those
anxious for its Civilization for a Length of Time.
He might go even beyond that magnificent tribute
he might go to the length of averring that —
The Comforts enjoyed by the Colonists in Consequence
of the zealous and laborious Exertions of the Soldiers of
the 73rd Regiment will long be remembered with their
grateful Recollections,
but even balm of that sort could not heal the
wound Macquarie had inflicted when he had given
Corporal Franke an extra stripe for playing the
sneak and turning barrack-room and parade-
ground into sub-divisions of hell.
Healing for that wound came only when it was
known later the same day that Sergeant Franke
was to stop behind, having obtained fifty acres of
land and tm overseership.
“ But, O Lord, boys, what'll life be worth now
for them convicts as lie’s over?”
This was the barrack-room sentiment. And it
was not thought merely and kept in. the thinker’s
own mind, but spoken openly without reserve as
a soldier should speak. And it was applauded
bravely when spoken.
For with the sergeant would passaway thechief
spy of the regiment, and the lesser spies feared
the rank-and-file more than they were regarded
by the officers. None of the lesser spies were
gifted like Phil. Franke with sweet manners and
a cherub’s face, and consequently none could get
the ear of the Colonel and the Major-General.
With every disposition to emulate Franke’s career
as a reporter to the High Powers of barrack and
guard-room discontent, two or three non -corns,
and several privates had been unfortunately de-
prived by Nature of the qualities necessary for
success. Which circumstance, if looked at in (he
proper light, will appear a matter for regret,
inasmuch as in the barrack room of the 73rd
rebellion was always in an incipient stage, and
the expenditure on a few military executions
would have conduced greatly to the prosperity of
the country.* At any time in our colonial history
up to 1825 it would have been an easy tiling for
our Praetorian Guards to have wrested the control
of the colony from the Constituted Powers, and
more than one such plot had been in course of
incubation within the quarters of the 73id. That
the eggs w r ere addled was largely due to our hero,
Franke.
* # #
Overseer Franke was installed in office the
day after the 73rd had marched down to the Cove
and embarked for Calcutta. The Outer Domain
Gang, as was the case with all low class labour (as
distinguished from the mechanics) were quartered
on the west side of the town in the sheds that
surrounded the Old Country Gaol. From their
squalid living-place, to the scone of their daily
work was a good three-mile walk, and that dis-
tance suggested to the fertile brain of the Overseer
an idea. It occurred to him the very day he
assumed command, but he was too astute to play
the new broom all /at once, so he deferred pro-
mulgating it in thb £ars of the Authorities till he
had beettisome weeks in office.
Then by enunciated it to the Superintendent of
Convicts, and the Superintendent of Convicts
passed it on approvingly to the Chief Engineer,
and the Chief Engineer quietly appropriated it as
his own, and strongly recommended it to Governor
Macquarie, who was graciously pleased, in his
capacity of Head of the State and Deputy-Provi-
dence, to adopt it.
Now, the idea, when we come to state it in cold-
ulooded print at this timeofday,does not challenge
admiration either by its daring audacity or sub-
lime originality. The defect, however, is not in
the idea, but in us. To appreciate an historic
fact you must weigh and estimate it in the light
of the day on which it happened. And the day
when Oveiseur Franke generated, and the Chief
Engineer appropriated, and the Governor acted
upon the Idea, was the Day of Small Economies.
The genius of Old Sydney in Macquarie’s early
years of administration was the genius of lavish
expenditure, but in his later epoch, the fine old
ruler worshipped at the throne of another God.
Things wore so skimped that even the hangmen
were compelled to be economical in the matter of
hemp. They wished to hang 20 Condemned one
d .y in ’2l in Lower George-street, and the Sheriff
could not succeed in getting together more rope
than would suffice to “top off” 19. It would
have detained the crowd and the Sheriff another
hour from breakfast to have hanged No. 20 with
tfferope which had already despatched No. 1, and
so, as the high functionary dare not anticipate his
next quarter’s advance by purchasing rope on
credit, he put back No. 20 for a week.
It is from the circumstance, then, that the spirit
of economy was abroad that Mr. Franke’s idea
derives its importance.
Instead of marching his gang from quarters to
the site of their work every morning, and march-
ing them back every night, he proposed that he
should camp out with them the week through,
bringing them in for muster —and divine service
—from Saturday to Monday.
This was his plan. In the light of the Admini-
stration, it was Splendid, Capital! For it pro-
mised to save the Government —time, sinew, boots,
money. If, in the process of economy, it also lost
a soul or two, well, that consideration could not
be permitted access to the Authorities’judgment
for one second's audience.
Mr. F. A. Holy, Principal Superintendent of
Convicts, once remarked to Father Ullathorne,
Vicar-General of Roman Catholics: “Absurd,
my dear sir! You ask us to consider souls. That’s
your business ! The Administration has to con-
sider rush /”
And Mr. Holy was right. He generally was.
When, for instance, he sent 73 assigned servants
—exactly 50 more than he was entitled to —to his
estate of 5120 acres, an estate for which he had
paid c£lo 13s. 4d., there can’t be the least doubt
he was right. Consequently, being never in
error, his opinion as to the folly of giving heed to
souls when cash was concerned, must b« re-
spected.
# * *
Nevertheless, that heedlessness was the
weak spot in Franke’s plan as the sequel proved.
It precipitated his pegging-out.
When Franke took charge of the gang there
was about five years’ clearing work to do on the
hilly land which ran from Windmill Ridge to the
South Head Road. All the area now known as
Darlinghurst was then wooded, sparsely in places,
but for the most part the timber was thick. The
task of clearing and burning-off with such appli-
ances as were at command of the outer gang was
heavy, and the allowance of five years’ time was
by no means excessive for the undertaking. The
ntiiof TO.nodtiAer. tmwßvnr waa aliln to renort two
years after the new Uverseer had originated ms
idea that the marked-out work would be completed
by the gang a good 12 months under the allotted
period. For this satisfactory achievement the
C.E. not unnaturally took the most' considerable
proportion of credit, but still he did not withhold
some tribute of appreciation from Franke. The
Overseer, indeed, should have had all, as it was
by his plan that the gang had got through so much
work.
The only people dissatisfied were the gangers.
The average number of men in the gang was 20,
and the- official power which directly controlled
them was made up by the Overseer, three &ldit rs,
and a scourger. Notwithstanding this ample
manifestation of care by the Authorities, the
gang grew discontented, and had to be soothed
back at sundry times into contentment and
resignation by two hangings, about a dozen of
imprisonments and several score of floggings.
But even gentle remedies of that kind were not
potent to keep always within bounds the turbu-
lence of felon-spirits that feel themselves injured
by three things which we shall enumerate in the
order of their importance as they stood in the
estimation of the genial Overseer’s proteges.
Firstly, the gangers objected to the deprivation
of their daily walk— ox’, rather, shuffle, men with
single or double irons on could not walk—to and
from the town barracks. They would not have
minded so much had the time ordinarily consumed
by the out-gangs in passing from the barracks to
the working places and back again been allowed
them for rest. But that was not so; they had to
work those two or three hours. Thus their hours
of labour were literally from sunrise to sunset,
though other gangs worked, say, three hours less.
Secondly, the camping-out system practically
gave control of their ration and clothes allowances
to Overseer Franke. And Overseer Franke, as
became an intelligent officer of the System, was
not slothful in the business of deriving a very
substantial addition to his x’ecognised emoluments
from those same allowances.
And, thirdly, they lost the sweet solace of com-
panionship with minds that ran in other grooves
of duty, which they would have enjoyed had they
been barracked nightly. “There is no apparent
motive for the prisoner’s murder of the deceased!”
remarked C. J. Forbes, at a later day, in the pre-
face to his summing-up on a capital charge.
“Beg your Honor’s pax-ding !” interrupted the
prisoner, with a courteous desire to set the Judge
—all things considered, the noblest man who ever
sat on a N.S.W. Supreme Court Bench —right,
“My motive’s plain ’miff. I wanted a change !
I gut so wery tired of gang-woik- there was no
wariety in it at all!” Well, that was just the
matter with Franke’s gangers. Ti e nightly chat
in barracks would have been a safety-valve for
their natures, and conveyed some refreshment to
their minds, but in camp their speech was
dammed-up, and their lips, if they did move
audibly after “ lights out 1” were in danger of
being sealed with a leaden seal.. “Fire into the
tents, sentry, if yer hear as the men’s a-talkin’
together. They may be concoctin’ mutiny!”
Thus the seven men who, on the average, were
the occupants of each tent (eight by eight its
floor area) were dumb perforce.
There is‘ no tyranny like that of the petty
tyrant, and there is no torture like that suf-
fered by his victims. The very littleness of the
source of authority adds another and acuter pang
to the pain. Had the thousand and one miserable
restrictions imposed by ex-Sergeant Franke been
directly ordered by a nominal gentleman, or by
* Colonel Ajth'wAn transmitting a return of expendi-
ture to the SeCrefljfM bf State for the Colonies, remarked
“ that every (ten. expenditure would be found con-
ducive of the prosperity of the colony.” The statement
included £BO 3s. 4d.. executioners' exnenscs.

an officer of commissioned rank, they would have
been borne the easier. Only a man with vermin-
soul could have designed and put into force some
of the methods adopted by Mr. Franke for the
subjugation of his men, and being what he was he
was not restrained by any regard for the common
humanity which the convict shared with himself,
such as even a Foveaux or a Rossell affected (if he
did not feel) at times. Intoxicate a creature of
his low stamp with the absolutism of power, and
you would develop a wretch that even Pluto, who,
so far as is known of him, has one or two gentle-
manly instincts, would surely be loth to employ.
Foveaux, after hanging a man in the presence of
his wife and child, patted the latter on its back
kindly and told it to—“ Never mind! mammy’ll
get you a new daddy soon, p’r’aps !”f Franke
would not have done that—he would have shown
the little one its father dangling at the rope’s end,
and would have smiled as he did it.
For Franke was the most ingeniously devilish
of the low-caste sons of the System that we have
come across. To what degree of excellence he
would have attained had the Outer Domain Gang
not interrupted his official career it is impossible
to say.
That thing they did : in the third year of his
Overseership they shortened his official career—at
least so far as the System was concerned, for
there is no saying what use could be found for him
otherwhere—by terminating his life.
Now that was unkind of the gang, it will be
admitted. The amount of work done by it under
Phil. Franke’s intelligent direction was so much
larger, as we have said, than could have been
expected that the Chief Engineer had marked
out for Franke in his mind’s eye a wider and still
more remunerative field of labour. And of these
new emoluments and this deserved promotion,
Franke’s gangers robbed him.
* # *
There had come a new man to the gang.
Occasionally, though rarely, it happened that a
ganger would remain deaf to the wiles of the
System and would refuse to extend his 7 years to
14, or his 14 to “life.” The men of Old Sydney
held out countless inducements to Government
men to extend their term of “ Gov’ment labour ”
indefinitely, or till it reached the foot of the
gallows, but now and then it would occur tlxat a
transport resisted the temptation in the shape of
scourgings and starvings to remain on the muster-
rolls—and became free.
Such an event had just happened. One Satur-
day evening when the gang went into the town
for Sunday Chapel and muster, one of the gangers
dropped out an expiree, and Mr. Overseer Franke
was consequently able to present no more than
18 at the muster.
“ Overseer Franke, how is it your gang is only
18?” demanded the Barrack-master; “your
strength’s 20 ? ”
“ Yes, sir, but your Honor has forgotten that
one man got his certificate yesternight ”
“That’s 19!”
“And one is waitin’ trial,* your Honor, for
assaultin’ me.”
“ Ah, that’s the score, but you’re still one short,
then ! There, go to No. 2 yard and pick out a
likely fellow.”
“ Yes, sir ! ”
And in a second, he had passed into the inner
quadrangle of the Muster-yard—some of the stone
wall is still standing—where 140 newly-landed
transports were huddled, pending inspection.
Up and down the ranks of sickly wretches —they
had been seven months on the voyage, and short
of water and lime-juice for the last month —he
passed, closely scrutinising the cargo. It was a
regulation that the Governor, or, if that was not
convenient, the Colonial Secretary, should allot
each new-comer to the work for which he was best
suited. The regulation had been obeyed in the
case of the Coromandel cargo. On the previous
morning (Saturday) His Excellency had inspected
the “indent,” and had selected every man who
said he was, or. seemed to be, a mechanic. Then
he had ordered the rest to “gang-labour,” and
thus left them to the tender mercies of the over-
seer. There are more ways than one of carrying
out a regulation.
“ A crawling, scurvy lot!” commented Overseer
Franke to the yard constable. “ I want a strong,
wiry ’un, an’ there don’t seem to be one in the
batch.”
“Try this cove wots over here,” suggested the
constable, and pointed as he spoke to where a
man, under the medium height, but otherwise
well-proportioned, stood, the centre of a ragged
group. “This chap ain’t much muscle to look at,
but he’s blooded—he’s got sperrit, I should say,
an’ ’udn’t prove a shiser. You try him, Mr.
Franke, sir. Here, you feller, stand out!”
The “ fellow ” stood. The grime of confinement
did not blur altogether the fine lines of his face,
and the delicate nostrils of the long nose, the
sweep of the eyelashes, and the chiselling of the
mouth, indicated blood and gentle nurture, while
the straightforward, lucid eyes spoke equally
clearly of a disposition of integrity. It was a
mystery how such a man came to be included in
the Ring of degraded scum, possibly only to be
explained by a sudden lapse into a criminal deed,
or, as an alternative (of which there are many in-
stances in convict-archives) that he was bearing
the brunt of some rich or great man’s crime.
“ Your name, feller ? ”
“ Edgar Allison Mann,” was the reply, respect-
ful in tone.
“ Edgar Man ! ” exclaimed the Overseer, aghast
at the fancied affront to his dignity. “ Man !
Do you know as you’re talking to a Hoverseer ? ”
“ Mann, sir, I said —M-a-n-n ! Edgar Allison
are my Christian names,”
“ Ah, that’s it, is it! Now, jest look here,
young feller, we ain’t a-goin to put up with your
xnserlence.”
“ I meant no insolence ! You misunderstood
me, sir 1 ”
“ Misunderstood yer, did I! Now, wot’s that
but inserlence, I’d like to know? Ain’t it inser-
lence, Constable ? ”
“It must be, Mr. Franke, sir, if you say so;
you have ’ad more experience than me, sir.”
“ By my lights, my flash cove, I’ll have to take
your flashness out of yer. A-tellin’ mo that I
misunderstood yer! Wot’ll yer say next, I
wonder!”
‘ ‘ you—are —a —blackguard—who—has
—beeh—invested—with—a—little—brief—author-
ity—over—your—betters! ”
The yard-constable held his breath ; Overseer
Franke let his tongue 101 l out in amazement; did
he hear aright, or had his senses deceived him ?
Did the audacious transport really mean to call
him all that ? The only sound to be heard in that
yard for some seconds was the half-suppressed
chuckle from a transport who was out on his
second voyage : “ Lord, ain’t the swell a-crackin’
a whid in prime twig !” J
“Wot’s that yer say?” Franke, when he had
got over the shock, said. “ Wot’s that ?”
Word for word, pausing between each as he
done before, the transport repeated his former
speech.
The whole yard looked for a burst of anger, and
an immediate presentment of the offender before
the Bax-rack-master with a request for condign
punishment. A genius like FTanke, however,
was above doing what common constables and
newly-landed transports expected from him. He
knew a trick worth two of immediate punishment.
“Yer’ll do, my man! I likes a feller with
pluck for xny gang, for it gives me som’at to do to
break him in ! March to the outer yard there—
yer are a-going to jine No. 3 Outer, d’ye hear
that ? ”
When Mr. Franke marched back on Monday
morning to the heights beyond Wixxdmill Badge,
there went with him Edgar Allison Mann, No.
14—736, as the twentieth man of his gang.
# * *
Mann adjusted himself with philosophic
fortitude to the terrible conditions under which he
was placed. Reticent as to his past, he strove by
whispered word and the example of a manly bear-
ing where the whole routine was carefully designed
to stamp out even the physical type of manliness,
to encourage his wretched fellow-gangers to look
to the future, to bear up under the infinite degra-
dations of the present by forcing their minds to
anticipate a brighter and happier time. His in-
fluence at the end of three months was extraor-
dinary. Even the Overseer could not but notice
it, and should have x-ejoiced at it, as in the
quietude of the gang, they worked better,. But
their superior discipline jnovoked Franke, for it
was none of his doing—caused, ixxstead, by a spirit
which he regarded as rebellious and by methods
he considered insubordinate, and Mann’s conquest
over the rude hearts of his fellow-gangers was the
more galling as it was a proof that he, the Over-
seer, fiad failed to break Mann’s spirit in the first
week of the young transport’s inclusion ixx the
gang.
lie had taken offence at the way Mann saluted
him, and understanding clearly that nothing was
more harassing to a convict of “superior posi-
tion ” than the necessity he was hourly under of
“capping” to the penal officers, he put him
through a course of instruction. He had permitted
the soldier-guard to supervise the labour of the
gang one forenoon while he devoted himself to
“ a-larnin’ the gen’el’man how to s’lute.”
For three mortal hours he kept Mann marching
to and fro on a path six yards long in front of the
tonts. He sat on a stool in the opening of a tent,
midway between the points at which the convict
had to turn upon his heel, and every time of pass-
ing, he ordered the prisoner to salute.
“One, two, three, four—s’lute ! Hand to your
peak; higher, feller!” Mann would obey and
pi-oceed. Returning, it would be—
“ One, two, three, four—s’lute. Left hand to
left leg, right brought smartly up, an’ held there
till yer pass the orf’cer as yer payin’ honour to —
d’ye hear that, pris’ner, a-payiri honour to /”—he
would laugh gaily here, as though to accentuate
the stabbing insult—“ then one, two, three, four.”
And so to the end of the walk.
After that exercise of three hours’duration, Mr.
Franke turned to the transport, and said, with a
heavenly smile lighting up his cherub’s visage :
“And now, Mann, d’yer think yer’ll know
another day ’ow to salute properly ?”
“ I think so, sir !” responded Mann, with as
sweet a smile. “ I think so ! I’ll not forget the
lesson.” And in the self-abasement which dare
not groan aloud, he resolved he would not.
* # #
He dare not groan at that or countless
other insults, because groaning would have pro-
voked the application of the lash to his back.
And Mann dare not, for his soul’s sake, do that.
Like the poor sinner at Macquarie Harbour who
told Surgeon Barnes that once he was flogged
he did not care a brass farden what became of him
—he’d as soon go to hell as not —for his thoughts
were hell after the lash had bitten him (Charles
Buffer, to whom the Australias owe so much,,
wept as he heard Barnes’ narrative)—Mann knew
he was done for once the cat stung him. He would!
xro longer be a man —a human being ;he would be
an animal that cringed before such a creature as
Phil. Pranke, or he would be a desperate, blood-
craving beast. No, he dare not be flogged.
Always he held himself up with that hope that he
would always keep to the weather-side of the
Overseer’s mad passion.
But there was no knowing what a day would
bring forth in Old Sydney times, when the monarch
of the hour was a cherub of the Pranke variety,
Mann was flogged—4o stripes save one. “ That’s
Scriptooral, pris’ner,” grinned the Cherub—4o was
Overseer’s limit—“ an’l’ll take care the scourged
don’t give yer more. Peel! ”
“Peel,” he, Mann, perforce, did; and as he
stripped for the punishment, he swore to his
Maker that, before the next Saturday, the Cherub
should have a chance of seeing what the earth
looked like from another sphere.
The cause of the punishment was Mann’s cham-
pionship of another ganger.
The weekly ration of O. D. Gang consisted of
four .pounds of salt pork one week, and seven
' pounds of fresh beef the next, the flour-food being,,
week in and week out, ten pounds of wheat and six
pounds of maize, ground by the prisoners them-
selves, in their own time, mixed with cold water.
But Overseer Pranke, having been appointed by
reason of being in “detached camp,” a storekeeper,
was entitled to make issues from store to himself,
as overseer. And he would not have attained to the
eminence he possessed as an official if he had not ,
contrived to turn this arrangement to account.
As Storekeeper, he was entitled to buy at the >
rate fixed by the Governor meat, wheat, and!
maize, giving an order on the Deputy-Commissary- ■
General for the payment.
' As Storekeeper, he would issue to the Overseer'
(himself) the scheduled allowance of rations, tak-
ing his own receipt for the quantity of produce.
And as Overseer, he would issue to his men
what he pleased. And he pleased to issue very
little. He, as a fact, robbed them of nearly half.
One Monday an elderly transport, a coarse*
languid, brutish, “ First-fleeter,” working in the
hot sun, fell ill. He was thrust into the of
the gums till knock-off time, and then carried to
the tent, one of the tent-party being Mann,
In the stilt watches of a moonlit night, the sick
man became delirious for want of nourishment or
from the sunstroke. Mann rose and, as noise-
lessly as possible, so as not to disturb the other-
poor fellows whom slumber mocked, asked him
“ Could he do anything for him ?” But the First-
fleeter, in his delirium, made no coherent answer.
Mann went to the fly-opening, and called:
“Sentry!”
The one sentinel on night duty—twelve hours
at a stretch —challenged him and ordered him to
stand.
“Prisoner’s dying !” Mann never would permit
himself to fall into the use of the corrupt form,

pns’ner,” though nearly everybody, from the
Governor, Judges, and parsons, down to the
children in the streets, made the word a dis-
syllable—“Prisoner’s dying!”
The challenge had awoke the Overseer. He
came to the mouth of his tent: “ What’s that?”
Pris’ner sick in No. 1,” reported the sentry.
“Who’s that talking?”
“I —Mann—No. 20.”
Pack to your bed, Mann ! Wot d’yer mean,
my fine swell, disturbin’ the gang at this hour?”
“ The man—Cummings —is dying !”
“ Wot’s that to yer if he is ! The rule o’ camp
is no talkin’ arter ‘lights out.’ Back .”
“You are a murdering villain if you let this
poor devil die!”
“ 1 ire, sentry ! Fire ! ” And by virtue of the
authority which reposed in the bosom of the
Overseer, the sentry obeyed. He fired point-
blank- Mann had thrown himself down on his
side _of the tent —and First-fleeter Cummins’
delirium merged into, and ended with one deep,
low groan.
In the flapping of a swallow’s wing the young
convict was out in the moonlight.
“Shoot me, you murderous scoundrel! Shoot
me, if you dare, and all the soldiers in the colony
will not save you from the dogs. Shoot me as
you’ve shot that prisoner after starving him —he
was ill because you robbed him of his rations.
You’ve as much right to shoot me as that other
for you’ve robbed me, all of us, of our rations.”
A minute of silence. Then, the Cherub spoke
to some purpose.
“ No, no, my fine feller—we don’t Waste powder
an' shot on gentles. That’s the death they like.
It’s the cat as yer don’t like, an’ it’s the cat as yer
a-goin’ to have. Scourger!”
At two o’clock in the morning, on the height of
Woolloomooloo, with the soft sea-breezes chanting
plaintively through sassafrass and eucalytus,
Mann got his 39 ! Thirty-nine was scriptural.
* # s
From that morning Mann changed bodily,
mentally, morally. From that morning he lived
only for revenge ; he would not even wait to see
what justice would come forth at the Sunday
muster.
When the gang went out to day-labour, the
camp was in charge of the soldiers who had gone
on duty at daybreak. This day the soldier, instead
of taking his usual sleep, was obliged to continue
his sentinel-ship, for he had to watch over the
writhing body of Convict Mann and the stiff one
of Convict Cummings.
What passed between Mann and the sentry was
never known. It can only be inferred by the cir-
cumstance that the soldier threw in his fate with
the gang when they made their bolt, as they did
three nights later—on the Thursday.
* 9 *
On the Thursday night they bolted, under
Mann’s leadership, and seized a schooner which
lay out in the main stream. Overseer Franke, of
course, raised a remonstrance as to their going,
but they treated it as unpolitely as they did his
complaint that they were hurting him, when they
pegged-him out— alive— with tent-pegs and lines
-—on an ant-hill in the heavily-timbered gorge
between two hills.
Alive—with food j ust outside of his reach—and
a bullet-uole through his right hand, into which
aperture the ants Were directed by the ingenuity
of one Mann, who made a sweet track of the
Overseer’s ration sugar from a hole in the hill to
the hole in the hand.
About eight or nine years afterwards, Mr.
Absalom West was clearing some ground in Bark
’Urn Glen—now refined into Barcombe—when he
came upon a skeleton—-pegged-out. The manner
of the pegging-out you shall hear next time.

I he Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “nobility.”
Tf ‘? lbllc eye rejects as uninteresting more
lan ia of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started eleven years ago with no capital but brains,
and nas become a vast property, because it pos-
sesses a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the _ date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. I hey are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
Ninth the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress: it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now aifiicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over xvhom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the-
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familial
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman ■
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the ■
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s ■
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from 1
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any'
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest'
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the
public.

The River and the Wind.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
This is the strain the river sang
As it hurried to the sea,
Far from the city’s hum and clang )
“ Come weary soul to me.
The world is cruel, false, and wrong.
Shall it still torture thee ?
Thy life is young, the years are long,
There is deep rest in me.”
Uprose the wind to hush the song
The stream still called to mk,
"Thy life is young, the years are long,
There is deep rest in me.”
O wondrous wind, O kindly wind,
0 wind that sang to me :
"Live bravely on, if love you find,
The world has bliss for thee.”
O wind and stream ! O dear old spot {
They say that you are dumb,
I’ve lived in vain, for love came not,
So, wind and stream, I come—
And, wind, I’ll wait to hear the strain
1 erstwhile heard from thee,
If not, O stream, but sing again—
“ There is deep rest in me.”

Teetotaller Cupp, of Auckland (M.L.),

A young lady in Adelaide the other day,
walking in the street, trod on a match, which
ignited, set fire to her dress, and she died from the
injuries.
Thus Miss Anna Parnell: 4 4 Mr. Harring-

Item from a medical paper : The man who
pays no attention to the food that he consumes is
comparable only to the pig, in whose trough the
trotters of his own son, a pair of old braces, a
newspaper, and a set of dominoes are equally
welcome.
The Golden Crown, at Reef ton (W.A.),
lately put through 1000 tons of quartz with the
return of 12500z5. gold; and the Mount Bradley,
on the Brockman, crushed 789 tons for 810ozs.
The total result for the past year has been a yield
of 56770z5, 15dwts. 20grs. from 4631 tons 1 cwt.
stone. Altogether Kimberley is looking up.
“General” Booth says he has only seen
three or four properly-cultivated plots of land in
Australia, and they belonged to Chinamen. What
The Bulletin wants to see now is the plot of
land that Booth cultivated. So far, the only agri-
culture which that distinguished Hebrew has done,
to our knowledge, consists in cultivating the field
of human weakness, and digging it up with howls,
and irrigating it with drums and shrieks and
jumps, and then growing a big collection.
The tide which should be taken at the
flood has arrived for the Australian boy. Like
all other blessings under which we groan, it comes
from dear old Hingland, The Lords Commis-
sioners of the Admiralty have drafted the condi-
tions under which Australian youngsters will be
permitted to board the Royal Navy, and adorn
the Australian station. Here’s a glorious opening
for the hitherto hopeless youth, with tightbound
trousers, short back-buttoned coat, and plastered
forehead - bang! Consider the prospect, ye
Native Youths ! A trip to Hingland for six
months, and a return to Sydney with full permis-
sion, without fear of your mortal enemy the
“copman,” of swabbling up and down George-
street, eloquent with bugjuice—between two
44 donahs” in flaring cardinal, big - feathered
hats—-your own gallant gift to them-and
sheering off the port-bow of every pretty
creature you fancy, brinily 44 blessing your eyes ”
and addressing the policeman as “’ullo, old
party 1 ” as you cannon against first one siren
and then the other ; or familiarly telling the par-
ticular bobby who used to be the terror of your
street-amblings that he’s a land-lubber, and that
no land-lubber is allowed to interfere with Her
Majesty’s sea-blubbers while your quondam
mates —two of whose best girls now hang on
your very oaths as oracular, and love you
for yourself alone, glare with envy as they
cringingly endeavour to claim past acquaintance-
ship, which you haughtily ignore. Rip you go
starboard and larboard; luff and tack ; lurch and
roll; scud or lay to; commander of your own
craft and of two as pretty craft as you ever might
hope to pirate; splash through all the small cock-
boats in the offing, with none to say you nay, and
able to order up the refreshments on deck full in
the footbath, for yourself and party. Masthead
my tackling ! but there’s a vision of glory. Blue
jumper and full-bellied, loose-rigged bellbottoms,
with clean lanyard, and decorated hat, and—the
liberty of the footpath, and the love of every Poll.
Also, the offchance of being suddenly hauled
away from your Poll, and perhaps her’s and your
little ’un, and carried a thousand miles off to aim
at a cocoa-nut tree, or knock holes from a safe
distance into a few harmless niggers. Also, the
certain kicking, coalholing, mastheading, holy-
stoning, and general Sheol you’ll surely get from
every superior blubber aboard. Also, the know-
ledge that you are not your own master but a
hired assassin, that you might as well be in prison,
and that, if you escape, you’ll be promptly put
into gaol for any time up to several years. There’s
your chance, Australian Youth. Swarm it. Its
only recommendation to us is that it may rid us of
some of our most useless larrikins.

THE DOCTORS SHOOK THEIR HEADS.
“ I would give a million dollars for a stomach,”
said a wealthy American recently. Now, a
million dollars (£200,000) is a deal of money, but he
was not able to buy the article even at that priqe.
Mr. Thomas Gaskin, of No, 3, Poplar Row,
Darley Abbey, near Derby, is not so rich as many,
being a gardener, but he was ready enough to give
all he had for one thing he hadn’t got. Here is
his story, and he shall tell it in his own way. Mr.
Gaskin goes on to say : “Up to eight years ago I
had never lost an hour’s work through sickness.
In December, 1882, whilst living at Beeston, near
Nottingham, my .appetite fell away, I had dread-
ful pain after eating, a bad taste in my mouth,
which would fill with water and slime, the latter
so thick and sticky that I often had to remove it
with my fingers. My chest used to ‘ fill up ’ and
ray throat would swell so I couldn’t button my
shirt at the neck. I vomited a great deal,
chiefly a yellowish-green phlegm. I had a racking
cough, and would cough and strain till I bled at
the nose, and the blood rushed out of my ears. I
became exhausted and short of breath and had to
call the doctor, and was in bed five or six weeks.
“ I then went as out-patient to the Nottingham
Hospital, and after attending there for six months
was very little better. I got so thin that I was
like a ghost walking about, and my friends said it
was all up with me. For eighteen months I kept
getting better, then worse, and at last the doctors
recommended me to try a change of air. So I
came to Darley Abbey and my former master gave
me an indoor recommendation to the Derbyshire
Infirmary, Derby. I found, however, that all the
bads in the hospital were full, and I saw my club
doctor and also two doctors at Derby. The first
one said, ‘ You are in a galloping consumption, and
must die ; ’ the other doctors, after sounding my
lungs and chest, said nothing, hut shook their heads.
“Getting a trifle better my old master allowed
me to do what little I could in his gardens and
grounds; and some days I worked a little, and
then would be away for a few days. Tilings went
on like this until December, 1888, when I caught
cold, got very short of breath, and broke down
completely. I was always coughing and spitting
up phlegm, sometimes as much as a teacupful at
once, and was afraid to go to sleep for fear the
phlegm would choke me. At this time the whites
of my eyes turned yellow, and my eyes were
bloodshot. My lips and mouth were dry and
parched and I often broke out into a cold, clammy
sweat. My tongue was like a piece of brown
leather, and I could keep nothing down. I lost
over a stone weight in three weeks.
“ I managed to get up for a few hours at a time,
but was so weak I had to take hold of the
furniture to move a few yards. I was always
tired and weary, and sitting or lying, was never
at ease and got no real rest. Too weak to read I
often sat for hours looking at my hands—nothing
but skin and bone, and was so nervous I couldn’t
bear the least noise, and the children at play quite
upset me.
“The doctor kept on attending me, but he said,
‘ I can do you no good ; I can only patch you up,
because your lungs are diseased.’ I then gave over
taking his medicine and tried everything I could
hear of. One thing was a cough cure from London
that cost 225. a bottle. But nothing did any good,
and my friends who came to see me said, 4 Well,
you won’t cough much longer, you have merely to
prepare for another world.’
“ About the middle of March, 1889, a neighbour
named Joseph Tatham, who works in the paper
mills at Darley Abbey, said to me, ‘ Tom, did you
ever try Mother Sctgel’s Syrup ?' and told me how
he had been cured after being in the hospital. He
spoke so much in praise of this medicine I sent
my wife to Derby and got a bottle at Mr. Smith’s
Stores in Victoria Street. After the first dose I
had an evacuation black as ink, and vomited.
Then I fell asleep and felt rested when I awoke.
After taking the medicine for three days my
breathing got easier, my food kept down, and in a
few days more I was able to go out for a short
walk. By the end of a fortnight I went to see my
master, who asked what had wrought the
improvement, and I told him, as I tell every one,
that Mother Seigel’s Syrup had saved my life. I
commenced work at once, and have never lost a
day’s work since.
“ Of course my strength did not return all at
once, but after taking Seigel’s Syrup for six
months I was strong as ever in my life and have
continued so ever since.”
In giving his consent to the publication of this
remarkable statement, Mr. Gaskin requests us to
refer all doubters to him or to Mr. Keetley, Head
Gardener, Darley Abbey, who is acquainted with
all the facts alleged. Mr. Gaskin has lived at
Darley Abbey 22 years and bears an excellent
reputation.
Now, what was the complaint from which he
suffered ? Not galloping consumption, certainly
(as one. of the doctors thought), or he would have
galloped into his grave in less than three months ,
instead of growing worse for seven years. His
complaint was chronic inflammatory dyspepsia
(or chronic gastric catarrh), which has lung
symptoms like consumption, for which it is so
often ignorantly mistaken and wrongly treated.
When the right remedy, Mother Seigel’s Syrup,
was used the disease yielded, as all diseases of the
digestive tract do yield to that magnificent pre-
paration. We heartily congratulate Mr. Gaskin
on his recovery, and commend the facts of his
case to all thinking people.

For females of all ages these Pills are invaluable,
as a few doses of them carry off all humors, and
bring about all that is required. No female should
be without them. There is no medicine to be found
equal to BEECHAM’S PILLS for removing any
obstruction or irregularity of the system. If taken ac-
cording to the directions given with each box they will

Extract from Sydney Morning Herald, referring t°
the exhibits in the United States Court, Centennial Inter
national Exhibition, Melbourne, says :—“A little more to
the westward, the visitor finds a platform on which are
placed a number of Hammoquette Reclining Chairs, one
of the latest things from that Ingenious class of Americans
who devote their lives to (he invention of ob rets which
shall minister to the fastidious tastes of the invalid, or
meet the luxurious demands of the wealthy. The Ham-
moquette Chair, constructed mainly of American ash,
colored to resemble mahogany, is shown by R. B. Jones,
6 Bridge street, Sydney, and can, at will, be made to
assume a great variety of shapes. It is difficult to con-
ceive a more valuable addition to a sick room, library,
study, or verandah, than the Hammoquette Chair must
prove.”
Parliament House, Melbourne.
Mr. R. B. Jones,
Dear Sir,—ln reply to your letter of Bth instant,
have much pleasure in stating that the nine chairs
purchased from you have given me every satisfaction.
Yours truly,
M. H. DAVIES, M.L.A.,
Speaker Legislative Assembly.
