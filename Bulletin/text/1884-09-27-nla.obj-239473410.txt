A Question and an Answer.
the students of political economy there
is on© fact which they cannot reconcile with
the theories taught in the schools. It is
that, although a century has gohe by since
the appearance of Adam Smith’s great
work-, and although teacher after teacher
has arisen to prove the soundness of Free-
'tradev the nations, with one exception,
Repudiate it. In connection with this sin-
gular fact, the following letter, recently to
hand from a Victorian Protectionist, will be
read with interest:—
•'To the Editor of The Bulletin.
'"‘Stm—Having been a constant reader of the
•ohlV 1 common smso paper ’ in Australia, for
heme time viz., The Bulletin, I would like your
•opinion ot Protection v. Fre -trade, and also as to
the probability and desirability ofJthe introduction
of the former Into New South Wales, as woll as
into the other Australian colonies.
‘•One thing In particular strikes me very forcibly:
If is the false impression which the words Fret-
irade and Protection convey. Tho idea con-
stantly associated in my mind with the word Free-
trad© is Protection by the abolition of duties ; by
Which those who have plenty of capital, plenty 9!
labour, both cheap, plenty of skill, a great start in
Point of time, and shipping, often idle for want of
employment, and only possess land and raw
material in limited quantities, can compel those
*1* distance, who have none of these essential ad-
vantages but the two last, to continue mere pro-
ducers of the raw materials; a state which
checks population, and renders us dependent on die-
tant markets, both for every article of com tort
and convenience —indeed, most of the neces-
saries of Jlfe—and for the disposal of our produce;
a state which must throw the balance of prosperity
Very much in favour of distant and densely popu-
tated countries. Protection is, in fact, to my
mind, Free-trade among ourselves. Such Protec-
tion will not, as is commonly supposed, render
articles of necessary us<?, convenience, or luxury
dearer to the consumer: at any rat©, not in the
long run —because we have unlimited moans ot pro-
duction, and numbers of people eager _ at a
moment’s notice to enter on every imaginable
enterprise, on encouragement being given them
by the State, and so, in time, to bring produce to
the lowest possible paying price. This would be
the means of a considerable population, now living
at the expense of the N.8.W, community, be-
coming both profitable consumers and producers,
as is the case now in Victoria and America.
“ Yours, &c.,
“ Sept. 15th," 1884.”
The foregoing was received by us a few days
ago. It asks for an opinion on a question
which, since the publication of the “ Wealth
of Nations,” has been dealt with more ex-
haustively, contested more fiercely, than
any other with which we are acquainted.
By writers with the grasp of Buckle the
proof of the economic soundness of Free-
trade and the fallacy of Protection has been
received with tho same confidence as Eu-
clid’s demonstration of pons asinorum. \ ot,
in the face of ai guments advanced by some
of the acutest intellects of the century, the
fact still stares us in the face that there is at
present no absolutely Free-trade country in
the world. England is the nearest approach
to one, but even she imposes duties on vari-
ous goods. “For revenue purposes,” say
the Free-traders. Be it so. We shall not
quarrel about words —but she has import
duties all the same. It would be well, then,
if Free-traders would occasionally come
down from the lofty platform of “ obvious
truth,” on which they have established
themselves, recognise the fact that with one
exception all the great States of the world
cling to Protective duties; that some have,
at various times, made a start towards Free-
trade, but turned back long before tney
reached their destination; and that the men
who guide the destinies of hundreds of mil-
lions, quite equal to the average Englishman
in ascertaining what is good for them, are
not altogether incapable of grappling with
the more abstruse questions of economy.
* • ♦
A and B are two countries, the former
small, densely-populated, possessing exten-
sive mineral deposits of coal and iron, and
immense sums of money invested in ma-
chinery for the working up of raw matt rial
Into marketable merchandise. It also com-
mands abundance of cheap labour. Free-
trade is the obvious and common-sense
policy of a country so situated. “Send me
your raw products,” it says to its neigh-
bours. “ 1 will make better articles at a
cheaper rate than you can possibly do if you
manufacture for yourselves. Send me your
hides, tallow, wool, and ores, and with the
superior and cheaper methods at my com-
mand, I will return to you leather, cloth,
candles, and metals at a less price, and of
superior manufacture, than you—owing to
the backwardness of your machinery and
your high price of labour—can make them
yourselves. Confine yourselves to the call-
ings for which your country, owing to its
position or extent, is adapted; but beware
how you attempt to coddle industries to
which your land does not lend itself
naturally, or in which you can never hope
to compete successfully against us. Your
people raise wool and ore in abundance.
Good. By sending these to me, t shall re-
turn you cloth and machinery, which your
farmer, wool-grower, and miner can pur-
chase much cheaper than they could if you,
lacking our advantages, made them into
cloth End machinery at home. I would
benefit, so would you ; while between us we
would support a third .class—the sailors or
carriers who trade between us.” Stated in
this way, without troubling ourselves with
the dust of the schools, Free-trade appears
mere practical common sense.
* * *
But, let us examine the matter from B's
standpoint. B has an unlimited territory
with mineral deposits far exceeding in
extent and variety those of A. But, in two
things it is far behind—capital, and cheap
and skilled labour. It adheres to the Free-
trade policy; sends all its raw products to A
and receives manufactured articles in re-
turn. So things go on, till, population
increasing in geometrical progression, it is
found that the production of raw material
is not the only thing for which the country
is adapted, and that such production cannot
absorb all the labour. What is to be done
with the people? “Employ them in the
profitable and natural industries of the
country,” says A ; “ put them on (he land,
on the station, and in the mine, but take
care how you meddle with natural laws, by
employing them in pursuits in which they
cannot compete with me. And, if they can-
not compete with me in certain things, no
further proof is wanting that those things
are better adapted for our people than for
yours. By endeavouring to prop up by arti-
ficial means callings which do not take
kindly to your soil, you throw the whole
economic machine out of gear.” The be-
wildered B looks round ; sees scattered pro-
digally through the land, above and below
ground, unlimited resources; sees the peo-
ple being forced into a few great industries,
and hears ringing in his ears, “without
diversity of employment you cannot have a
great nation.” At last he says, “ 1 will have
such diversity, even if I have to pay for it.”
“Take care,” whispers A; “your farmers
and miners will not give £1 for a bad coat
when they can get a good one for 15s.”
“True,” answers B; “but their sons and
daughters who are not adapted for the farm
or the mine will have careers opened to
them which will remain closed so long as
freedom of barter exists. For this they are
willing to pay, in the hope that, as my
resources are greater than your', the time
will come when—in my own market, at any
rate—I can meet and beat you. Under that
very Protection which you now llout, your
own industries grew strong and hardy.
When they were able to go alone, you took
off their swaddling-clothes, and then pro-
claimed to the world that it was wrong even
to put them in petticoats. I cannetbe far
wrong in following such an illustrious ex-
ample, until the time comes when I also
shall proclaim to the world that the millen-
nium of calico has arrived. ]
• * •
Expressed in homely terms, this was the
main line of argument that induced America
and Victoria to turn to what the economise 8
consider the “exploded fallacies ” of Pro-
tection. They saw the population increas-
ing, the warehouses packed with foreign
goods, and the people—or, at least, those of
them unable or unwilling to swell the ranks
of those employed in a few staple indus-
tries —idle. In thepagesof the great wri ten,
from Smith to Mill, they read that the
erection of artificial barriers to exchange
would end in discomfiture. “Protect, by
means of high tariffs, any particular indus-
try,” said the economists, “and watch the
result. Some of your citizens will engage
in such protected industries, and make for-
tunes. Their example will be followed by
others who see in such callings a sure path-
way to profit. Competition sets in, the
margin of profits decreases, wages follow
suit, until at last your workmen touch that
pauperism they were so anxious to av.oid.
Put a swinging duty on textile fabrics. For
awhile all goes merrily. The capitalist in-
creases his capital, and the workman enjoy s
high wages. But, by and bye, money which
should be employed in the staple industries
of the country is diverted to the manufac-
ture of cloth. Down comes the price of
home-made stuffs, with the rate of wages
close on its heels. No law will prevent com-
petition, and no law keep wages above the
point at which it will pay the capitalist to
employ it.” The Americans and Victoria! s
were quite aware of this and all the other
arguments advanced by the economists. It
is a mistake to suppose they legislated in tie
dark. They saw that, however favourably
situated a young country was; however
adapted by nature for certain industries, it
was next to impossible for those industrus
to have even a beginning unless a helping
hand was given them. No Protection, no
manufactures, was their cry; and who will
say they were wrong ?
• • •
Take a familiar instance of how laws which
carry conviction in their very statement
would work if carried out. There is no eco-
nomical law more axiomatic than that every
man has a right to carry himself and his
industry to the best market. It is the very
a b c of Free-trade. Let us suppose, then,
that a few millions of Chinese—they would
scarcely be missed from that populous em-
pire-having heard that operatives in F.ng-
land earned bs. a day, while their earnings
amounted to as many pence, landed in
Great Britain to-morrow. According to the
Free-trade theory, they would be quite
within their rights in ousting the operatives
of Lancashire. They and their families
could live on a day, and in a short time
become as expert as any Lancashire work*
man. Judged by the Manchester school
they would be welcome. They would lower
the cost of production, and thus enable
Manchester to undersell all others in the
markets of the world. But how about the
workmen they had displaced? It has been
, found necessary iu America and in Australia

“Throw physio to the dogs.’’ Certainly
we agree with Macbeth, of murderous memory,
that such an operation was a rightand proper one,
for the dose prescribed for the uneasy conscience
and disordered stomach of the homicidal monarch
would probably consist of about half a gallon of
some particularly nauseous compound, But now,
“throw physic to the dogs,” oh, dear.no! We ab-
solutely rejoice at the idea of medicine, for it
means an absolute feast of little sweetnesses—
pillules, they call them—which, placed upon the
tongue, impart a pleasant flavour, and cure all
our ailments as they gently dissolve and spread
their healing influences through our possibly de-
bilitated carcases. Such is the comfort of Homoeo-
nathv and another comfort is that you can procure
eleirant remedies at Anthony Hordern and
Bone, Palace Emporium, Haymarket.*
There is a “Pickwick Club” established
in Maitland, the object being anti-shouting, and
that members shall have “three hours' rational
amusement two nights a week at the small weekly
cost of 6d.” A lot of the bank clerks are in it.
They probably think subscribing to the club the
sum named is far better than lavishing that
amount on diamonds tor prime donne.
to legislate against this threatened influx of
Chinese. England thinks it barbarous, for
the simple reason that England is safe from
such an invasion. In the same way, Eng-
land thinks it suicidal for Americans or
Australians to reject the Free-trade doc-
trine. “ It has made us the richest nation
in the world,” it says, complacently. Pos-
sibly, but “ the bitter cry of outcast Lon-
don ” is still loud in our ears. Your money-
bags are overflowing, and your pauperism is
the by-word of nations.
♦ * *
Was there ever a great State that did not
offer a diversity of employment to its people ?
We know of none. The Free-traders rea-
soned as if the earth was a kitchen-garden—
one plot adapted for onions, another for
oranges, and a third for bananas. “ Do not
endeavour to grow onions here or bananas
there,” they said; “stick to the products
the plot will best grow.” And so far they
were right. Where they were wrong was in
supposing that the end of life was in buying
in the cheapest market and selling in the
dearest—in flooding the world with goods
produced at a cost so nicely balanced
as to allow the workman just enough
to keep body and soul together. But
the earth is not a kitchen-garden, and
the people inhabiting it have various
ideas as to what constitutes national
greatness. According to economic axioms,
the people of New South Wales are in the
ri'-ht track and those of Victoria in the
wrong. Suppose war broke out to-morrow
—in the present state of European affairs it
is always on the cards—in which England
was involved. In any great imbroglio,
Great Britain with her interests touching
every sea, could not long afford to stand
aloof. Hostile cruisers are in all waters, a
few Australian trade-ships are captured, and
in a short time the manufactured goods that
New South Wales was in the habit of im-
porting from England or America would
have to be obtained from Victoria. This is
no fancy picture. Anyone who has remarked
the exhibits in recent exhibitions can readily
say on which side the manufacturing supe-
riority lies. In the great American rebellion,
the collapse of the South was in no small
degree due to this very aosence of manufac-
turing resources. This is a phase of the
question which has not occurred to our
Free-trade friends. But long before the
dawn of the Twentieth Century the chances
are altogether in favour of England’s having
to engage in a great war, possibly to hold her
own, possibly for existence. Assuming that
she triumphed, it is certain that, in the very
teeth of the economists, she would have to
impose duties to clear her debts. We give
this for what it is worth. It is merely given
to show that, however positive may be the
dicta of men who, from their closets, look
out upon the world and lay down rules for
its guidance, the exigencies of national life
override all such rules. The closet philo-
sopher sees in the influx of Chinese nothing
lo cause alarm—nothing but the natural de-
sire of man to bring his wares to the best
market. Th® statesman sees in it the going
down of a superior civilisation before an in-
ferior—the survival, not of the Attest, but of
a low-type, half-fed mammal over a pro-
gressive, well-fed one—and acts accordingly
• • •
And now, for Free-trade and Protection.
Our opinion—given, be it said, with a due
knowledge and regard for the gieat authori-
ties arrayed against us—is that in the life of
a nation, as in that of an individual, there
are periods when a change of diet is neces-
sary. The aliment that supports the man
would be fatal to the child. Even Mill ad-
mits as much—grudgingly, it is true, but yet
he admits it. He hedges round his admission
with many safeguards. But the fact stands
out that, under certain circumstances, Pro-
tection may be the true policy. Most of his
English admirers, of the Cobdex and Bright
school, part company with him there. They
say that the law of free exchange is as bind-
ing as that of gravitation. There we part
company with them. There may be great
manufacturing countries which did not pass
through an apprenticeship of Protection,
hut—we cannot call them to mind. Some
ardent Free-trader may, perhaps, remember
them ; but, until he tells us of them, shows
how the law of untrammelled barter is im-
perative at all times and under all circum-
stances, and points out how the United
States and Victoria have lost by having
flouted it, the opinion that N. S. Wales and
Australia might benefit by a protective
policy will remain unskaken.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Australian Cricketers.
No one can be unconscious of the fact that there
have been growing troubles in respect to the
status of Australian cricketers claiming to be
amateurs while supporting themselves on the
money paid for admission to witness their per-
formances in England. Their claim to be regarded
and treated as gentlemen amateurs has been dis-
tinctly challenged, and in many quarters per-
emptorily disallowed by English censors. Thus
a large section of the English press withholds from
them the distinguishing title of “Mr.” as a prefix
when recording their exploits, and their stipula-
t ions with regard te “ gate-money ” have been
adduced as disqualifying them from the status
of hand fide amateurs. It is probably vain to
argue that if the Colonials be disqualified for
this reason, Lord Harris and his associates
equally disqualified themselves while travelling in
Australia by the same practice. The plea is
cogent, but those who practically hold the power
of deciding—the Society people of Bngland-are
indisposed to listen to it. The solid fact is that
there is a conflict of social systems. In England
the definition of what, strictly speaking, consti-
tutes a gentleman differs essentially from the defi-
nition accepted in the colonies. In the older
community, the aristocratic sentiment governs all
matters of social usage, and to be dependent on
one's personal exertions for a livelihood is, in the
severer eircles, regarded as a disqualification to be
ranked as a gentleman. Trade, even on a grand
scale, is a disqualification. Even the vastest re-
sults in the form of wealth only gilds the fact, but
does not make the social status sterling. There
are a few professions which a man may engage in
and not lose caste. These are chiefly privileged
occupations, protected in a degree frorp common
intrusion. The service of the Sovereign, the pro-
fession of law in the higher branch, the service of
the State Church, and in a qualified degree the
profession of physic, and banking, are within the
limits of caste. But cricketing for a living has
never been included, and the pretensions of young
men from the colonies to be exempt from social
disqualifications which natives of England have
always assented to, are received with a certain im-
patience. The ideas of the two communities are,
in fact, radically opposed. And, we think, the
colonies have all the best of it. Here, honest in-
dustry in any avocation carries with it no social
degradation. We approach nearer ideal justice;
and the contemptible creature is the loafer—the
man who does not work and take his part in the
active enterprises of the community. With us, a
man who makes a living by doing anything well is
more regarded than the man who merely amuses
himself by doing the same thing either well or in-
differently. In England, the man who amuses
himself is more highly regarded than the men who
works in earnest. You may amuse yourself with
a lathe and remain a gentleman. But earn your
living as a wood-turner, and you lose caste. We
prefer the colonial ideal.

Sir Henry PARK.ES’'speech, at the breakfast given
him by the Temperance and Local Option people*
was a very able one—a very able one, indeed. The
intention of the promoters of the breakfast had
plainly been to take advantage of the veteran
politician’s present forlorn condition in order to
strike a bargain with him. A Mr. Hutchinson
stated the nature of the proposed contract with
an entire absence of finesse. Sir Henry being in
a condition of political destitution—that is to say,
destitute.of a party or following—Mr. Hutchinson
explained that he had pitied the sorrows of a poor
old man, and that the Temperance organisations
would supply Sir Henry with a following—for a
consideration. The consideration suggested was
a surrender of independence by Sir Henry. He
was to take a pledge—not a temperance pledge—
but a pledge to be the servant of the Temperance
people, with a brevet commission as nominal
master. The wary old fellow saw the snare quite
easily, and as easily slipped the noose over the
necks of his would-be captors as he slipped his
own out of it. His adroitness was something ex-
quisite. He played with his hearers and tickled
them, and treated them to the adroltest sort of
raillery, without for a moment losing his grip.
They have constantly denounced moderate
drinkers as the worst antagonists and obstruc-
tionists whom Temperance reformers have to
wrestle with. Sir Henry alluded to his deter-
mination to continue a moderate drinker,
with a dexterous complaisance which seemed
to impress his hearers with the conviction
that a moderate drinker is the exact de-
scription of person who should be selected
by total abstainers as chief, guide, and model.
Sir Henry led his teetotal audiences, by their un-
blossoming noses, through the prohibition State of
Iowa, and made all their mouths water—or rather
wine—with sympathetic thirst, as he artfully de-
scribed his unsatisfied longings for a “small bottle.”
In short, he fooled the sssembled zealots—worthy
men, but not over wise—to the top of their bent,
and, by the time he had done with them, ho left
them in a fevered state of exultation, and per-
fectly charmed and satisfied with him and with
themselves, under the rather singular conditions
that, while he had accepted the proffer of their
allegiance and support, he had most artistically
disclaimed any pledge or obligation whatever
which would prevent his accepting the leader-
ship of the Liquor Interest next day without
breaking a single promise. The side-splitting re-
sult of the 1 demonstration islthat, while the Tem-
perance organisations have pledged themselves to
back up an unrepentant and almost satirical
moderate drinker in whatever he undertakes, he
remains entirely unhampered by any equivalent
undertaking. Sir Henry simply laughed at his
hosts to their faces, in a quietly effective way,
which must have won him many friends among
the liquor people; and he accepted their vows,
while making none himself—unless a vow of fidelity
to the “small bottle ” can be regarded as sufficient
consideration for the support of the Total Ab-
stainers.
TO CORRESPONDENTS.
[Correspondents who give neither name nor nom-de-
plume cannot expect to have their com-
munications noticed.]
“J. Sherwood”: From your handwriting
and mode of expression, you would be adapted for
office work, but, unfortunately, the market to
which you would bring’ your wares is already over-
crowded “J. Nagle”: Scarcely In our line. In

Your letter covers a lot of ground. Concerning

vanity. Only let them try to put their resolutions

which make for ultimate separation, despite the
commonplace utterances of commonplace men.
— “Vulcan”: There is a good deal of sound com-
mon sense worked into your poem “ Laguna.” We
seldom get poetry like yours—possessing a clearly
| defined motif. For instance, the verse—
“Although there is plenty of money granted
On the roads, we don’t get our share,
But they don’t forget to make us pay taxes,
The way we are treated is not fair,”—
is a really telling indictment against a notoriously
corrupt Administration. The expression “ On the
roads” may suggest unpleasant remembrances to
some; and, indeed, we would have omitted it, but
for the manifest unfairness of garbling a suggestive
line. The verse—
“ Where the money goes to is a.question
It is not easy for to solve;
Everyone has their own suggestion.
But it is evident it don’t revolve,”—
expresses tersely a problem that has kept us awake
many a night. “ It don’t revolve”—there’s no mis-
take about that. At least, if it does we are not in
the line of its orbit, and you appear to be in the
same fix.

You can scarcely ride a saddle horse
From Laguna to Currenbong.”
This is serious. We’ve heard before that the Wol-
lombi people were not to be trifled with, and that
the Wattangan Creek men could strike home, but
we certainly didn’t know the road was so bad
between Laguna and Currenbong. But camels

fifty years? Don't expose your ignorance like
that. Way back in (he stone age, it might have
been thought the thing to keep quiet at the plays
of the time while the star was braining a ‘ supe.”
But we have improved. The proper thing now is
to carry on a conversation with some one, three or
four seats away, while the leading lady is spouting
trash from Shakespeare or Goldsmith.
Says the Sydney correspondent of the
Tentebfield Star:— “The band, by some extra-
ordinary faux-pas, played two bars of the * Dead
March in Saul ’ (on Parkes rising at the banquet),
which can only be explained by the supposition
that the band was melancholy and elevated."
Perhaps they were thinking of the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth, on that
occasion ?
NO GOOD.
“I won’t re-enter public life,”
The great Sir Henry whined;
“ No more I’ll brave the wordy strife,”
He’s f ot his pockets lined.
He knew, as he sat with a frown.
The other “ push ” had scooped the town.
A native of India was recently brought up
at Degra Dun, charged with killing and eating a
boy. He had the balance of the boy, after a square
meal, rolled up in his waistband. When interro.
gated by the magistrate, he said that it was an
unfortunate affair, but what could he do ? He had
rendered his account faithfully for the last two
years, but he only got pine-cones and hardwood in
exchange for a paper that he had established to
supply a long felt want.
“Three times around an elephant’s front
hoof is said to be his exact height.” You can
sometimes find the height of a country member of
Parliament by going half round his front hoof.
Here is another bit of natural history: “ During
their early locomotive stage, the young fry of the
oyster have a pair of distinct black eves to guide
them in choosing their future home; but, as soon
as they settle down fora lazy life on some ledge or
bank, the eyes die away, and the animal passes the
rest of its existence in complete and contented
blindness.” We wonder whether Piddington, John
Lucas, &o., find anything in th*s which reminds
them of the N.S.W. Legislative Council?

VANITY FAIR.
At- the great Health Exhibition in London,
the Princess of Wales was presented with a bou-
quet, which, even to one who had seen the re-
sources of luxury almost exhausted, was a novelty
and surprise. It was not only that the flowers
were of priceless beauty, hut they were lit with
tiny electric lights, making the flowers and blos-
soms all seem to have jewelled centres In
Vienna, a club has been started to provide poor
put deserving girls with rich husbands. No one
can join except wealthy men and each binds him-
self to marry a girl who has neither money nor
claims to any. If some rich beauty seduces him
to break his pledge, he forfeits £500, which goes to
help make some othergiil happy....Competition
’fi neauty is so keen now-a-days, that a girl must
be very audacious it she wants to keep ahead. At
a recent flower-sale in England, one girl com-
pletely crushed all the otheis by drawing every
juntleman In the place t) her stall. She had a
fieure famed for its beauty, and a marble purity
or skin. This she not only snowed to its most fas-
bating extent to the young men who faced her
at the stall (all the others could do that), but be-
hind. her dress was so scooped away as to resemble
a sculptor’s nude model. But, you say, there was
bo one behind to look at her? of course not,
Dooby. Hut at the back of her stall was a huge
‘boking-glaga. It was this looking-glass that made
ail the other poor girls feel they had been out-
manoeuvred ... A curious fashionable novelty in
England was the acting of a drama in the open air
oy a mixed company of professionals and ama-
teurs. “ As You Like It” was the play, and in tim
grounds of Coombe House, near Wimbledon, a
glade of lime trees was found to admirably suit
for the scenery. A dense foliage formed the back-
ground, rough piles of wood marked the sides, and
a row of dwarf ferns served as footlights. Four
hundred fashionables witnessed the play, which
was for a charity, and the part of Orlando was
taken by Lady Archibald Campbell. The last
thing wc recollect Lady Archibald taking was, to
the wearing of trousers For the gratification of
good young girls, wo may mention that the dress
in which Princess Louise of Wales was confirmed,
was of simple white India muslin of the finest tex-
ture, with a pleated flounce, tucked at the edge,
falling half w-'y down the skirt. The bodice was
pointed, and the tunic draped over the hips in soft
folds. A gathering of muslin round the neck
looked simple, girlish, and prettv. ..Miss Beatrix
du Maurier, daughter of the Society artist of
London Punch, was married the other day. She
is as handsome as the grirls her father draws. A
lot of artists were present at her wedding, and the
six bridesmaids all wore white sprigged muslin
Tbe luxury of Parisian attire is nearly incredible.
An elegant Parisienne has to pay from £50 to £100
for an average ball-dress by one of tes grand
faiscura, or at least £10 for the most modest morn-
ing dress. Underlinen has become so sumptuous
that chemises have lately been made for Parisian
belles at £110 a piece. There has to be equal ele-
gance in bed-room attire, which is made of finest
fabrics, and ofttimes worked and shaped and
embroidered as finely as a spider’s web. As
it is intended “to catch," perhaps this is
quite right. Then there must bo a separate
dress for every “ function’’—one for the break-
fast, tbe ride, the drive, the tennis or archery
meeting, the opera, ball, five o'clock tea, the races,
the parade, the seaside, and so on. And yet, some-
times, the fair Parisian has hardly anything on....
One of the last names coupled with the Lily’s is
Mr. HarrylOelrichs’, who has been called “Mrs.
Langtry’s cowboy.” It is true he is a rancher
now. But a few years ago, Oelrichs was a well-
known fast society man of New York. He took
to stock-raising, and, being successful, has now a
handsome ranche with all luxuries, and always
numbers of visitors to enjoy his French cook’s
dinners and splendid wines.
The “Homo Physician,” by Dr. C. W,
Board, is a Cyclopoedia of Domestic Medicine,
which Messrs. M’Neil and Coffee, of Sydney, are in-
troducing. It is a thick volume—thicker, relatively,
than an alderman’s head, or a politician s skin. It
contains more leaves than a popular actress takes
of a public which keeps on attending positively
last farewells. A good many positively last fare-
wells to life would possibly be averted if the
“Home Physician” were in more homes. The
work strikes us as being quite as good a one
as Ardill’s City Mission. Wo have looked
through it—the “ Home Physician ” we mean, not
Ardill s little scheme—very carefully, and it
strikes us as being the most valuable book of the
kind for family use we have ever seen. The in-
formation, &c., is modern and recent, wherever
we have been competent to judge it. The illus-
trations are copious and useful; while the text is
written in homely English, which every mother
can understand at once. The book can be left any-
where within reach of children and no harm
ensue. Honestly, we like the book, and believe it
to be a valuable domestic guide.
Thus reproachfully, recently, murmurs
Mary:—“ We have not received our cony of the
Bulletin for the past three weeks. Oh, Bulle-
tin, Bulletin ! why hast thou forsaken us ? ’’ Oh,
divinest of thy sex, Mary, Queen of C-ircoar! what
sweet pain fills our raptured soul on finding our-
selves so despairingly remembered in thy orisons,
and yet so gently chided by thee in thioe owu in-
comparable tly-poison paner. By the high hev-
ings, Mary ! it is a fearful thing to be as handsome
as we ourselves are, and yet so utterly unab'e to
atford relief to the countless thousands of High-
born dames who are daily dying for one of our all
too lovely, three star Aurora smiles. Half of our
time is spent m receiving the dj log pinions of the
slain, and the balance in ascertaining which of the
chosen people will advance the most on the
cornse's underclothing. At the same time, how-
ever, sweet n-mph, the language in which you
clothe your chiding is by no means original. Read
Matthew, chap. 37, v. 46. and you’ll find it written;
“Eli, Eli, Lunina sabacthani.” And, finally, the
cause of all your trouble is not because the Cap-
tain Kidds and Ned Kellys of the Post-office love
their Mary less, but because they love their Bui.uk-
tin more. Shake ’em up with your shoes, Mary, and
we may be happy yet.
Devotion,

No artist has ever yet been degraded to
the peerage. A knighthood is at present all that
has been attained in Great Britain by painter,
sculptor, or architect. Lord Tennyson may pos-
sibly live to welcome his buster as “Lord Wool-

may expect Lord Salisbury to have become plain
“Mr. Cecil."
Some faint idea of the majesty of the
positions occupied by our colonial “ ambassadors ”
may be formed from the following fact. A little

Mennell, “ to have a shave, and then I am going to

It is discreditable that the King of Sweden
should, during his London visit, have had to stay

Sweden, some years ago. Buckingham Palace is
practically empty, yet the King was not invited.
The English Court has obtained an unenviable

> Queen Victoria is credited with having

her accession. She had just been reading to the
Duchess of Northumberland the passage where
Cornelia, the mother of the Gracchi, brought for-
ward her children, exclaiming, with maternal
pride, “ These are my jewels!” The little Princess
here laid down the book, and, looking up into the

they must have been Cornelians!”
What glory! By permission of Sir Salmon
Wilson, the annual August Bank Holiday demon-
stration of the London and Westminster Working
Men’s Constitutional Association was held at
Hughenden, the seat of the late Earl of Beacons-

He expects the piece will not be licensed for
England by the Lord Chamberlain, which. “ of

elsewhere.” The forbidden is always delicious.
Mr. Irving has a tragedy (or a melodrama) on the

the “Little Father,” for Heaven’s sake not to
abandon his proposed visit to his affectionate chil-

Here is a nasty piece of high treason about
“ Albert the Good,” who was so deucedly well paid
to be good. A London pressman says:—“Speeches
on the franchise question are getting almost as
common as statues to Prince Albert were some
years back. I wonder what became of all those
statues? There wasn’t a town in England that
wasn’t going to have one. At one time there were
about three thousand on order, and the Prince of
Wales was driven nearly mad by applications from
mayors and town councillors and old ladies to come
and unveil them. Perhaps they were altered, like
the figures in Jarley’s waxworks, and now do duty
in various parts of the world for soldiers, states-
men, and public benefactors.”
M. Henan has been banqueted by his fel-
low Bretons of Paris. The Bretons, said the great
Frenchman, were an artless race, believing in the
true and the good, and as happy as kings, with a
little idealism, not adapted tor making fortunes,
bub adapted to obtain something better, viz., hap-
piness. His own mother, at 87, after a long and
■painful malady, uttered pleasantries an hour be-
fore dying. M. IRenan concluded; by giving a re-
cipe for happiness, viz., the disinterested pursuit
of science, art, human welfare, or the country’s
service. He should face death without sadness,
for he had fully enjoyed life; and should die con-
gratulating the young, for life was before them,
and Hie was an excellent thing.
Mr. George Lanseil, the Sandhurst “ quartz
king ” has met with a very severe buggy accident
in England, one of the effects of which will, it is
almost certain, be to deprive him of the use of an

but Mr Lanseil, to whom an heir has been born in
his old age, appears to bea good deal happier than,

Hartmann, the Nihilist, who, according to
a report, since contradicted, recently suicided
through sheer want, had for some time been
living upon the charity of sympathisers. In No-
vember, 1879, while engaged with the Russian
heroine, Sophia Perovsky (who was hanged with
Roussakoff), in digging the dynamite mine under
the railway, destined to blow up Alexander II.,
the funds ran short. Hartmann, therefore, pledged
his watch for eight roubles, which amount enabled
him to complete his work. This circumstance
saved the life of the Emperor, as, without his
watch, Hartmann miscalculated his time, and
sprang the mine upon the first train, which carried
only the Imperial servants and luggage: the Czar
following in another train.
A good many people were glad when they
read that Mr. David Blair was going to deliver a
lecture in the Collins-street Baptist Church, Mel-
bourne one night recently. They remembered
that he had a week before auctioned out his fine
assortment of books, and they rejoiced that the
old man before he died was about to exhibit his
great mind in its native majesty. But they were
disappointed. The grand intellect kept behind
things still. Although the books were gone it still
squatted behind “A bundle of old letters. What
these people now yearn for is that the grand old
man of the South should auction out his bundles ot
old letters also, and then come forward with a
speech. That would be worth publishing m the
Victorian Review after the weekly papers had
refused it insertion.
Tom Hughes, the author of “Tom Brown’s
Schooldays,” has been circulating a tale about
some “ bookies ’’—“said to hail from Australia —
winning the superfluous cash of a lew youths at
the gambling table of an Atlantic steamer. The
venerable Tom has been full up against gambling
ever since (so rumour says) he had a bad week
once, himself, in his younger days. He s quite as
much an apostle of anti-betting as Bootn is ot
anti-beering, and never lets a Derby pass without
bewailing its wickedness in some magazine or
newspaper. All the same for that, we re sorry the
bold bad men “said to hail from Australia
cleaned out those guileless youths at the gambling
table (we suppose he means the smoking-room)
of the Atlantic steamer, and should have felt down-
right grieved if things had been the other way
about. “Advance Australia!”
Sir Samuel Wilson has given a written
denial to the stories about his “ squaring ’’certain

Wicked people have whispered that Sir Sam s
cheque for £5000 had found its way to the pocket
of Mr. Van Bacrle, late private secretary to John
Bright and Lord Carlingford. and this, presum-
ably, is the chief of the “offensive allegations
which the virtuous Victorian is now so indignantly
repudiating. Poor Samivel! He is trying _ hard
for hereditary nobility, no doubt, but he’s not
quite such an amateur at “ squaring ” as to think
that a few cool thousands to “late ” secretaries
can do much in the matter. It’s big dinners to
the reigning powers “ as does it.” Only get the
right public men at your table, and just the right
things Inside their stomachs, and you can die a
Duke.
The Imperial Parliament voted £3725 for
the funeral expenses of the Duke of Albany, who
was consequently burled as a pauper, though he
had £25,000 a year from the nation, and left £46,000.
Asks a London paper:—“ Why cannot the estate of
a deceased Prince, like that of meaner mortals, be
charged with the expenses of his funeral ? It that
rule hold, then the friends of the Duke of Albany
might have spent, had they cared to do so, not
£3000 only, but £30,000, and the public would have
hao no right to complain. It is not uncharitable,
however, to assume that the cost of burial would
have been much nearer £300 than £3000, if the
family of the deceased had been required to meet
the charge.” The payments to the Royal family,
in hard cash, total £886,973 per annum. When a
Prince is made a Duke, the nation has to pay,
when he gets “ the garter ” it has to pay; when he
crosses the channel it has to pay. But le jour
viendra!
The Directors of Convict Prisons have de-
cided that, on the Claimant leaving prison, he
may provide himself with plain clothes, in lieu of
the service suit of Tweed, almost as distinguish-
able as the convict’s uniform. “Sir Roger has
declined the offer of two suits from a Portsmouth
outfitter, but says ho will purchase his outfit. Due
would almost imagine that Fat Arthur wouldn t
care about entering a "new suit. And it is
stated that arrangements are being made by the
East Kent branch of the Temperance Union for
the Claimant, on his release from prison, next
October, to travel about the country lecturing in
favour of total abstinence, and relating experi-
ences of how he, during his incarceration, has
lived without alcohol 1 This is making a virtue
of necessity with a vengeance. The Claimant will
be about the biggest of all the rogues who have
made a living out of the temperance movement.
Fat Arthur’s god used to be the gastronomic
patron of his once extensive anatomy. A course
of gaol-diet has almost deprived him of his deity,
but perhaps he intends cultivating, to quote
Shakespeare, “a fair round good capon
lined,” as soon as he gets out of uurance.
Edward Wakefield, M.H.R. for Selwyn,
,N.Z.. and editor of the Timartj ’Ebald, is cer-
tainly a smart man and a good public speaker, but
he ought to have known better than enter the
lists as a debater against an old war-horse like Sir
Julius Vogel. “ A. consistent politician must be
j either a fool or an inspired prophet,” quoted Ed-
ward. “ Nobody can say the honorable member
is inconsistent,” replied Julius, “but I am sorry
to hear him set himself down as a fool.” “The
honorable gentleman opposite, possibly owing to
his deafness, did not catch my meaning,” shouted
Edward, holding his open palm to his mouth to
send his voice direct into the Julian auricular
organ. “WhatI said was this, that a consistent
politician must be either a fool or an inspired
prophet.” “ Exactly so.” replied Sir Julius, "but
I scarcely thought the honorable gentleman
would expect the House to believe him to be an
inspired prophet.” Then the House yelled, and
Edward subsided.
When the relief expedition reached the
camp of Lieutenant Greely, the Arctic explorer,
Greely was just able to support himself on his
hands and knees. Ho was dressed in fur, with a
red knitted hood, which added to his haggard ap-
pearance. His long hair and beard, his wasted
form and deep-sunken eyes, which shone through
his glasses with increased brilliancy, and his feeble
voice—which he strove to control, but which re-
vealed his overpowering feelings—brought mois-
ture to the eyes of the strongest of the relief
party. On either side of him lay one of his com-
panions. both in a dying condition—Corporal;Elli-
son, with both feet frozen off, unable to raise his
head; and Private Maurice Connell, in a sleeping
bag, dying of starvation. Lieutenant Greely had
been reading the prayers of the dying when the
party arrived. The survivors of the party had
lived for some time on minute shrimps, sea-weed,
sassafras, rock lichens, and sealskin. They claim to
have got nearer the Pole than any previous expe-
dition.
A younger son of the Duke of Argyll
became engaged to Lady , and, as in duty
bound, asked his father’s approval. The Duke
answered: —“ Since my eldest son, the Marquis of
Lome, married the daughter of the Queen, our
Sovereign, he has become the head of our house.
You must obtain his consent.” The Marquis,
when applied to, said he would have to consult
the Queen. The Monarch, when asked, replied
that *• ever heaven deprived her ot her noble,
ever-lamented husband, she had made it an inflex-
ible rule to take no step in the affairs of her house
without first referring the matter to her brother-
in-law, the Duke of Coburg.” The Duke informed
the Queen that he would have to consult the
Emperor, who declined to take any step without
seeing Bismarck. Bismarck's answer was given
without hesitation: “Why should the matter re-
quire any decision of mine ? What have to do
with the Duke of Argyll or with his son ? If the
voung fellow wishes to marry, let him do so, and
be hanged to him.” This story appears in a Ger-
man paper, and is said to have been told to an
Austrian diplomatic official by the great Chan-
cellor himself. Who says the English aren t now
governed by the Germans ? The Queen and Royal
family were all born in England, and therefore
English; but not one of them has a drop of Eng-
lish blood in his or her veins.
Captain Pollard, of H.M.S. Defence, who
has been ordered to be dismissed the service for
negligent navigation, which brought about the
Defence and Valiant collision, was ouce.previously
dismissed a ship tor imperilling her safety. In the
Defence case he thus closed his statement to the
court martial: —“I repeat that I was ordered to
execute an evolution under circumstances new,
dangerous, unrecognised, and unpro-
vided for. No rules were laid down for my
guidance, for no rules that were ever framed have
contemplated the execution of such a manoeuvre
in close order. Misled by a tnisc uculation tor
which I was not responsiole, I acted in a manner
which no doubt brought my ship into a difficult
position. Finding her in that position, I say that I
turned the impending catastrophe ot an end-on
collision—which probably would have caused the
sinking ot one or both the ships—into a collison
which left one ship unhurt and caused but small
damage to the other. Such is my defence. I urge
no personal considerations. I have served the
Queen for thirty-eight years. I am now close on
my flag rank. You have the power to blot out the
whole of my professional past, and to destroy the
whole of my professional future. But 1 do not
appeal to sympathy, nor am la suitor for your in-
dulgence. I have stated my case, and in the hands
of my profession I leave it.” The evolution which
brought about the mishap was the same as that
which led to the sinkiog of the German ship
Grosser Kurfurst.
Thus a London writer“ It is not often
given to Londoners to see a real live King, with a
short pipe in his mouth, stop to have his boots
blacked at a street corner. I saw the sight last.
Saturday at the corner of Bloomsbury-street, and
the King was Tawhiao, Tawhiao has • cottoned ’
to our English ways wonderfully. He is devoted
to hansom cabs, and he has lately developed a taste
for skittles. The cockneys have grown quite used
to the sight of his tattooed Majesty, and if he and
Major Te Wheoro were to go to Hampstead Heath
next Monday with yellow paper round their hats,
and play at kiss-in-the-ring, there isn’t a small boy
that would think of giving vent to even the sotto
voce ‘Crikey!’” And then there is this story:—
“The Maori King has suddenly expressed a deep
desire to join the Salvation Army. He would have
been enrolled and made a captain at once but for
one little difficulty. He makes it a distinct con-
dition that he shall be allowed to piny the big
drum. The General has heard him play in private,
and has been reluctantly compelled to decline the
honour. He is afraid the services would be the
drum, the big drum, and nothing but the drum.
His Majesty, with that native independence which
is his distinguishing characteristic, bangs the in-
strument when and how he likes, and spurns the
idea of time. Another little difficulty was the pipe.
Tawhiao couldn’t be made to see that smoking was
inconsistent with beating a big drum during a
service of song.
Tlie constituents of J. W. Thomson,
member for Clutha, N Z., decided to give him a
free funeral on the occasion of the demise of his
political principles. When the train reached
Clinton from Balclutha, one evening lately, a
crowd of people 'dressed in black, a brass band,
and a hearse were in attendance at the station. A
black coffin, which must have cost at least ten
bob, was taken from the guard’s van and placed
in the hearse, and the procession started for the
cemetery, the band playing the “ Dead March.”
At the cemetery gate a fierce individual, with a
fire helmet on his head, a lighted torch in one
hand and an enormous meat-chopper in the other,
stood on guard, and in a voice of thunder de-
manded to know “ Whose carcase be that there,
inside the hearse?” “Thish,” replied the chief
mourner, solemnly, “thish is the mortial remain-
Ings of the late Mister Thomson, member for the
dishtrict.” “ In that case,” yelled the guardian of
the dead, “ he can’t be berried ’ere. This ceme-
tery is for honest Christian people as dies in
grease, and not for a false poulitician like Mister
Thomson, 'fake him down to the ( swamp, and
stick him in alongside my ould coo as died o’
pleurisy.” The procession accordingly started for
the swamp, where preparations had been made for
giving a fitting reception to the remains. On ar-
rival there, the coffin was broken open, the body
taken out and dipped in a cask of sheep-dip, and
then thrust head foremost, with the legs sticking
up, in a half-empty tar-barrel on the top of a pile
of firewood. Then there was a bonfire, and the
proceedings finished up with the usual big drunk.
Hitherto it has been the custom to open
English assize courts by reading an ancient pro-
clamation against vice and immorality; but, by a
recently-issued regulation, this very unnecessary
formality has been dispensed with. The other day,
however, Mr. Justice Watkin Williams and Mr.
Justice Lopes went to open the Nottingham as-
sizes and Insisted on delivering the venerable
jeremiad aforesaid—they did not, they observed,
like to see the administration of justice robbed of
any of those forms which had hitherto helped to
impress the masses with feelings of awe and re-
verence. Well, next day Mr. Justice Williams died
suddenly—of rupture of an aortic aneurism; and
as he did not happen to be at his own hotel at the
time of his death, a fussy mischievous coroner in-
sisted—despite the advice of bis “ brother Judge,”
who stuck to him in true antipodean form—on
calling witnesses as to not only how and when, but
also where, deceased had met his death. Prior to
the enquiry a lot of fulsome gush was trumpeted
forth about as pure a man and as perfect a Chris-
tian as ever lived, and a parallel was drawn be-
tween the death of Judge Williams and that of
Mr. Justice Talfourd—which was a cruel libel, for
the latter died while doing his duty on the Bench;
while, now that the scandal has become public
property, for it comes out that Mr. Justice Wil-
liams died at a tempi 3 of Venus presided over by
one Nellie Banks, “lately of Sydney, New South
Wales.” The London papers kept the matter
quiet, but a Nottingham journal has very incon-
veniently let the cat completely out of the bag by
printing a two and a-half column report. This
case recalls two similar incidents in Australia a
few years ago—in one of which a well-known
barrister died at Sandhurst; in the other, the
victim was a very fashionable young Melbourne
solicitor.
John Peter Dowling, late respected resi-
dent of Pentridgo prison (Melb.), was a man by
whom fortune—fickle fortune—dealt singularly
unkindly. Nature so evidently intended him for
an alderman, that it’s positively distressing to hear
of his premature decease while yet only a con-
vict. lou will share our grief and grasp our
logical deductions when we mention that John P-
Dowling succumbed, in solitary confinement, to a
surfeit of hominy and bread. The same glorious
appetite, which would have been John’s greatest
blessing if he had but lived to attain civic digni-
ties, was his bitterest curse under the unfortunate
circumstances of a prison life. Turtle soup may
be disposed of in wholesale quantities, but hominy
(the never varying Pentridge mtnu) requires to be
dealt with sparingly, and not in the liberal spirit ot
our late lamented friend. Medical evidence dis-
closes the fact that “ his gullet was filled up to the
throat,” and his death was due to “the disturbed
state of the stomach.” A Corporation committee
should be appointed to collect funds for the pur-
pose of erecting a suitable memorial to John. *ve
shall be happy to subscribe a little something.
We’ll subscribe an epitaph:—
Poor Dowling with the angels sings,
Far, far beyond the skies:
Meanwhile, his mournful story brings
The tear-drop to our eyes.
He died of eating prison faro
With hunger all too keen—
Ah I what a splendid sort of Mayor
Poor Johnny might have been I
The stomach n hich could find delights
In hominy and bread
Should surely, if it has its rights,
On nicer food be fed.
So now that John has passed away
To realms described as blest,
Let’s trust they give him, every day,
A dish he can digest. M

“Reminiscenses,’, and “reverental,” and “pellite

from the blemishes which as honest critics we
have put our tinker on, the volume is a readable
one. It gives a tolerably fair portrait of Clarke,
though, perhaps, in dwelling too much on the un-
businesslike phase of his character it helps to
create the the impression that the man was a bit
of a Horace (which he wasn’t) ; and in
tne selection from his writings it provides the
means of taking a pretty accurate gauge of the
limits within which Clarke’s genius worked. We
hope the sale of the work (being as it is for the
benefit of Marcus’s widow and orphans) may be so
good as to necessitate the issue of a second edition,
with the errors which are in the first corrected.
Queen Christina, the hot-tempered consort
of the doubtfully-bred Spanish monarch, appears
to hold touchingly original ideas about the duties
of a second wife- So far from being jealous of
Mercedes, her predecessor, the present Queen de-
lights to honour the memory of the first legalised
recipient of Alfonso’s warm attentions. On oyery
anniversary of the death of “ my sainted Mercedes ”
(as Alfonso called her during the brief period of
his sorrow), Queen Christina takes a drive to the
Egcurial Palace and drops a wreath upon the tomb
of the “ other,” and when Providence sent her a
princess, the dear little stranger received the name
of Mercedes from Its broad-minded mother. Tho
reverence which Chriss. so constantly exhibits to-
wards her husband’s first wife is even extended to
his first mother-in-law, for we learn that the
Duchess de Montpensler occupies the “ place of
honour in the Royal carnage and on all public
occasions.” Such wifely generos ty as this Is truly
beautiful, and, under the circumstances, a little bit
artful. Christina’s pilgrimages to the Escurlal. we
guess, are made with the idea of tickling up hubby’s
conscience on the subject of marriage vows and
their sscredness. It’s pretty well understood that
Isabella’s son, liice a true chip of the dissipated old
block, plays the very Dickens with those said
vows: and, in addition to having forgotten all
about number one “rib,” even goes so far as to
overlook the existence of “ number two ” on sun-
dry occasions. When he lets himself in with the
latch-key in the small hours, Christina murmurs
softly, “no wonder the other poor, dear thing
died 1” and displays her sympathy by buying one
more wreath.—
Hints to “ Seconds.”
The right thing to do in this commonplace life
(Or so men had hitherto reckoned)
Is all mention to drop of your first darling wife
Directly you tackle a second;
For the fair one herself,shrewd observers have said,
To number one’s name doesn’t “ cotton,”
But prefers to ignore the poor lady that’s dead,
And let her lie cold and forgotten.
But Christina, we think, a grand pattern has set.
Which in our esteem should exalt her,
By taking good care that her lord shan't forget
The wife he once led to the altar.
(By the bye, Chriss an eye to the future may turn,
And thinks that as Alf. has had one die.
She herself may give place to a third in her turn,
So does as she’d like to be done by.)
Dear girls who throw in with a widower’s lot,
Have thought for the wife that’s departed
(Who, like “ Gunpowder-Treason,” should not be
“forgot”),
And he not unkind and cold-hearted;
For the same fickle Fortune that called her away
Has made you the happy successor—
Just reflect upon this at her tombstone, and say
“ She gave me my hubby, God bless her I ”
Last week we gave a portrait of the Hon. John
Bryce. This, we give an outline of his public ser-
vices. The Hon. John Bryce, Native Minister of
the colony, taking one week with another all tho
year round, is undoubtedly the best-abused man
in New Zealand. The people of the Southern half
of the twin colony—the citizens and settlers of
Dunedin, Christchurch, Invercargill, and sur-
rounding scenery growl at him continuously and
viciously for his large expenditure of public
money in keeping up an armed force for tho sup-
pression of all possible disturbances in the Native
districts of the North Island. The people of Auck-
land consider him altogether too lenient with the
Maoris. A war of conquest, and, if necessary, ex-
termination, would please them much better than
the present style of slow suppression and masieriy
inactivity. The denizens of Napier, Gisborne, and
other settlements on the East Coast revile him
with great Intensity of feeling for his action in
pardoning and shaking hands publicly with the
notorious Te Kooti — the blood-stained mur-
derer of women and children in their districts.
The Natives themselves,notwithstanding his efforts
to protect them, regard him with mingled feelings
of aversion and fear. They submit to him, and
obey his commands, because he is John Bryce, and
they know he is not to be trilled with. The whole
locust host of Native Land agents, interpreters,
bush-lawyers, and Native Land Court hangers-on
and officials regard him with dread, as the instru-
ment destined to cut short their little games of
spoliation and robbery. Even large capitalists and
land-owners who support the G o vernment of which
he is a member, regard him distrustfully, as the
only one of the Ministry they are unable to bend
to their purposes when occasion, in the shape of a
big transaction in Native real estate, requires his
co-operation. In fact, to put the matter in plain
figures at the highest possible estimate, it just
comes to this: that John Bryce is a good deal too
honest and level-headed to meet the views of
some of the busy, clever, scheming, speculating,
money-grubbing, land-shan.ing colonists of New
Zealand. A man with more jaw and a back-bone
of a more pliant description would suit them much
better. Whatever may be the views of people
whose pockets are affected in a way displeasing: to
them, there can be only one opinion on the im-
portant fact that, since his acceptance of his pre-
sent office, Mr. Bryce has wrought a great and
much-needed reform in Native affairs. Formerly,
all was confusion, accompanied with much waste
of public money, and nothing to show for it but
ever-increasing distrust and disorganisation. Now,
all this is changed: Natives and settlers are alike
protected, tho expenditure has been reduced, and
order evolved from chaos. The Maories have been
taught the wholesome lesson that they must obey
the law, and settlers in the vicinity of Native
settlements can now move about unmolested by
those who formerly interfered with their liberty,
i hey can now sow their ttelds with the certainty
that they will be allowed to reap their harvests in
peace. When they go to bed they are now no
longer under tho dread of a midnight surprise and
massacre. Bona fide settlers in the North Island—
who have nothing to gain, but everything to lose
by native troubles and rebellion—regard John
j C@ u as tlie strong man of the present Ministry,
and they would be heartily sorry to see his plaee
occupied by any less resolute and fearless suc-
cessor.
Let us see!—Shall we give you this in
Prose or rhyme ? In rhyme ? Good I —
ou remember what we wrote about patrician
Parson Ross,
" ith his crosses and his flowers and his candles
in a row?
How he loved the High Church fashions; how he
. frowned upon the Low;
Ana ins callous congregation, how they said it was
no loss—
Bei gifted with the intellect of
be shook the dust from off his feet and forth
Wi( F°® th u em did go,
"ith his hunting-whips and horses, with his
Pistols and his dogs ?
D prose: too much rhyme is apt to clog.
onitJ u newest thing about this cambric cleric is
tr., e to„ charac t eri8tic - After he had gone, the
thot „ 8 ’ or churchwardens, or elders, or whatever
nar4„^ re made a visit of inspection to the
stahiio^ 6 ' ' J hey discovered that the walls of the
8wni ■ we . re covered with crosses of various de-
eh'aiv 'J 1 1 oxtapositlon with calculations in red
silt-o- „ * ae C08t °t a Pair of blood horses, a set of
on Q‘‘ mou nted harness with crest engraved there-
by' a „ „ open carriage, also a phicton, and a suit of
of amf v^ ry ? ear for a “ tiger.” These evidences
mirtvT and i° w iy spirit were the cause of much
to t’he beholders. But when ttiey came
hiah, .“ ( ! uee their mirth was suddenly stopped,
witha, r ! re tt, “ front door was a little grave,
Q a tombstone over it, on which was cut th i
simple but touching inscription “Tom.” The
churchwardens exchanged .'glances of furtive sus-
pieion, but on© of the party happening 1 to remem-
ber that Parson Hoss had a favourite retriever of
that name, the temporary uneasiness passed away.
It seems that this gay churchman cherished,
among his other crotchets, a sort of sub-belief
that horses and dogs have souls—a theory held by
no less a person than John IVesley—and naturally
wanted to mark the spot where his dog was buried,
so as to be able to find him at the Resurrection!
The trustees were very indignant about this. But
why ? The—but, perhaps, it will go off better in
verse. Now—
The inference to us is plain;
We sec no fog I
If Parson Ross will rise again.
Why not his dog ?
They dug the tombstone up, however, and threw
it o\ er the fence. They have no sentiment,
those rustics of Queanbeyan. And, while we are on
thm subject, we may as well give you another piece
ot information about the Protestants of that pious
village. When the Reverend Ross “dusted” out
of the place no successor was forthcoming. Con-
sequently, the services had to be carried on by the
pastor of an adjoining parish. The Bishop of
Goulburn was applied to to fill the vacancy, but
# 8< ? UQ til they had paid up the stipend
of Mr. Ross. It seems there was some trouble
about the stipend. There always is. The trustees
refused to comply, and the Protestant religion, for
which so many martyrs bled in the pages of Mr.
box, was very nearly being annihilated in Quean-
beyan at one fell swoop. One of the trustees—
backed, it is understood, by a large following in
the congregation-proposed thatthechurchshould
be turned into a hay and corn store. And this
proposal might have been actually carried out.
and th° nevil have taken possession of tho people
a little sooner, if the Reverend Kingsmill, of Gun-
ning, had not come to tho rescue in the nick of
time (whatever the nick of time may be). So the
devil is at bay for the present, but ready to cut in
at any moment.
There is in England a man named Colonel
Gowen, who would have been useful had he been
m Sydney at the time of the Austral disaster. His
speciality is the raising* of sunken ships. In 1856,
other engineers having failed, the Russian Govern-!
ment sent for him to America, to see If he could
raise the seventy-six ships of war that had been
SUQ k |u Sebastopol Harbour, in sixty feet of water
and 36 feet of mud and clay. His chains broke 500
times, but eventually he raised the whole 76 shins
(the heaviest of which was the Vladimir, of 6000
V?" 8 and cleared the harbour. His
difficulties had been tremendous. Nothin* had
remained of Sebastopol. He had had to build his
own machine-shops and foundry to hnrmw
£30,000, to cut 3,000,000 feet of timber*3000 miles up
S?^KiPVv and transport it to the Crimea, and to
double the amount of his machinery owing to an
error in bis calculations. When the work was
tb „ e Emperor came and knighted him. But
let the Colonel tell his own story“ He said the
Government would buy my machinery, and
ordered an impartial commission to value it, which
was don®, the valuation being 455,000 roubles,
equivalent at that time to £75.833. Accordingly
MirOofo*' t0 i, Petersburg, called upon the
Minister who had been Instructed to pay me
an(i , him my documents. The
Minister said he did not know how to pay my
claim, that he had made no provision for it in his
budget, and asked me how I would like to take
bonds covering ten years for the amount. I told
him I wanted money, as the Emperor had pro-
mised. Well, he said, ‘you have been in the
country a long time; you go and travel abroad
tor a month and return here, and I will pay you.’
I went away for a month, and on my return the
Minister declined to pay me. ‘ You made a com-
plaint to the Minister of Justice about an officer at
bepastopol, and it jeopardised my office. (He had
desired me to make this complaint.) Now 1 will
be j yo HF ene my. I will never pay you a penny,
and will see that you are not paid.’ I went to the
Grand Duke Corstantine, and had an audience.
He received me kindly, saying he was sorry I had
to come a second time for my pay. I told him I
had not yet been paid. ‘The Minister says you
have, he said. ‘I paid you,’added the Minister,
who was present. I again protested that I had not
been paid; but Duke Constantine said he could
allow no altercation before him, and that the
Minister was a Minister of the Crown. I replied
that there was no reason why a Minister of the
Crown should try to deprive me of my property or
its equivalent. ‘ Whom shall I believe,’ said the
Grand Duke, at length; ‘a Minister of the Crown,
whom 1 have known ever since I was a boy, or you
a stranger, whom I have known for only six years?’’
It is unnecessary to believe either of us If I
have been paid, there is a receipt in the Treasury
for it. Send to the Treasury and see.’ The Grand
Duke looked at me. ‘Do you think I would doubt
the word of a Minister of the Crown ?’ he said
sternly. ‘ This audience is at an end.’ And I have
never seen him since, nor got a penny. I have
spent five years and £5000 in attempting to get
paid, but without success. The Minister who de-
frauded me is dead. I shall never get paid now.”
The Colonel s friends floated a company in 1864, to
raise galleons sunk in the Gulf of Vigo by the
British fleet in 1793, and supposed to have a freight
worth ten millions. Two of the galleons were
seized by the British during the War of Succes-
sion, and there was a million in them. The Colonel
got a concession from the Spanish Government,
but Napoleon interfered, and tbe enterprise was
spoiled, the Prince of Orange and Napoleon then
secured the concession, and asked him to take the
management, but he refused. They sent down a
* reach engineer, who raised two ingots of silver
weighing Tiflb. The shares of their company then
went up 400 per cent. Orders were sent from
J ans for him to work on another vessel. Then
the J* ranco-German War broke out, and nothing
has been done since. Colonel Gowon says he could
get a commission from the Spanish Government
to-morrow by giving them 25 per cent, out of the
profits. The galleons lie in from four to ten
fathoms. They, are buried in the sand, but he
could reach them. It would cost about £20,000;
and he is confident there are £5,000,000 in the gal-
leons.

accounts for Sir Alfred feeling It necessary to

The laws of Victoria are something like
those of the ancient Medes and Persians, inasmuch
as they are unalterable. That is, they are rigidly
enforced so tar as the plebeians are concerned, but
when the aristocrats of that favoured colony are
interested then a loophole can be discovered with-
oot the aid of a microscope. The Victorian law
relating to the importation of dogs has hitherto
been stringently carried out, and all dogs, of what-
breed, size, age, religion, or nationality, have
been compelled to undergo a six months’ spell of
quarantine before being allowed to associate with
their colonial brethren. On the arrival of Sir H. B.
Loch, the new and popular Governor of the “ Cab-
bage Garden,” it was found that his suite
comprised a favourite Gordon setter, a valuable
and, we might add, a handsome :dog—a dog of no
common origin, but one of aristocratic breed—in
tact, a near relation to the Rev. Ross’s “purp,” a
Queanbeyan poodle upon whose high-toned an-
cestry some of our best poets have poured out
their souls in pmons of merited praise. Just as
Henry was about to step lightly ashore at
bandndge, after braving tho perils of the deep and
enduring the blighting influence of a Melbourne
Herald reporter, he was in the act of puckering
up h** lips to whistle for his daw#, when
i the ubiquitous Berry, who happened to be near,
grabbed the Governor’s coat tail, and, drawing* him
to one side, informed him of the terrible pains and
penalties that he would incur by allowing the
animal to place one of Its aristocratic paws on Vic-
torian soil. Here was a pretty fix I “Love me,
ipve my dog,” was an aphorism that Sir Henry be-
lieved in, and to go ashore without that poodle he
did not so much as dream of. The alternative of
Quarantining such a noble animal —in whose veins
coursed the blue blood of aristocratic canines—
with a lot of mangy curs that could, at best, only
trace their pedigrees a few years back, was oven
worse, What was to be done ? Grand prepara-
bad been made for Sir Henry’s reception—
officially, of course. The standing army of Vic-
toria had been drilled into a fairly efficient system
of presenting arras, without running any great risk
or poking their bayonets into each others’ eyes, and
Commandant Sargood had the Victorian marines
out in their new uniforms, and all other arrange-
ments were fixed up in regard to spectacular effect.
But the Governor would not desert his dog. Then
it was that the mighty intellect of the only Berry
grappled with the question, and in hot haste he
started off his equerry-ln-walting with an official
despatch to the Government printer conveying in-
structions for the immediate issue of a uazette
Extraordinary containing a Royal edict to the
effect that the back-yard of the Government
House had been proclaimed a special quarantine
ground for the sole use of the vice-rcgal poodle.
Thus the people s Berry again became the saviour
of his adopted country for the Governor landed, tho
procession moved on, and Lady Loch shook bands
with the statesmen of Victoria, including Hugh
M Coll. Nevertheless, Berry is not happy. H» is
now pestered with application from all parts of the
colony requesting that the back yards of the ap-
plicants should be proclaimed special quarantine
grounds. Wasn t it lucky that no stringent laws
were in force in re the importation of brahma-
pootras when our own Gussy entered our beauti-
ful harbour 1 For we have no Berry. (Thank

INDIA CHIPS IN.
“ Campbell Hospital, Sealdah, Calcutta, March 16,
1884:—Having heard of the healing and curative
powers of ST. JACOBS OIL in cases of sore
throats, pains, &c., and suffering while in this in-
stitution with a sore throat, I obtained the per-
mission of the medical officers, who attended me
for small-pox, to use it, and have much pleasure in
stating that a single application gave me much
relief, and in three days, using the oil twice dally,
I felt rid of the sore throat. I have no hesitation
in recommending the use of the same to others,
and feel sure they will find the oil give instan-
taneous relief. I would also here mention that
with the sore throat I had a severe pain in the
( jaws, which was removed after only two annllca-
tlonsof ST. JACOBS OIL.—(Signed) E. A. Pekeiba,
( Head Inspector of Post-offices.”

ORIENTAL GOLD
Is the latest discovery of Science and the grandest
achievement of the alchemist’s art. It looks like
Sold, it is as heavy as gold, and it la more enduring,
one but an expert can detect the difference, and
then only by the severest tests. Ornaments made
from this new composition are equal In design and
general appearance to those made of the finest
18-carat gold, and yet we sell them at but a tithe of
the Cost of the genuine goods.
Remember that we do not pretend that Oriental
Gold Is anything but a composition of pure metals *
but we do affirm that it is so perfect an Imitation
of the sterling gold as to almost defy detection.
Jewellery made of it may be worn anywhere, and
the closest inspection will only strengthen the con-
viction that it is real gold. So perfect is it, and so
large has our trad3 become, that Jewellers through-
put the colonies are complaining of the dullness
in trade, and are constantly writing to- us to secure
our goods for their own customers. But as we are
Sole Agents for these colonies, we prefer to deal
directly with the public. All of our Oriental Gold
Jewellery is made to our order, and is stamped
with our trade mark. You can order anything
from a Scarf Pin to a Watch and Chain, and it will
be sent Post Free, and at our risk, on receipt of
price.
SPECIALLY OBSERVE.
Should you be dissatisfied with your investment
after inspecting the articles, re-pack them at once
and send them back to us. If this is done within
two days—or where mails are few, by the first post
after receipt, and the articles are not injured—we
will return the money, deducting only the trifle
expended on postage. You can keep any one
article and return the rest, and we will refund the
money for the articles not retained. Pair dealing
is our motto, and we bind ourselves to give satis-
faction. Examine our catalogue, and send in your
order for what you may require.
N.B —We And that, through an error on the part
of the manufacturers, we are overstocked with
Brooches, and for the purpose of making a rapid
clearance of that line of Goods, we will send to
(post free, if at a distance) on receipt
pf Five Shillings (5s.), a really exquisite Oriental
Gold Brooch, equal in design, finish, and appear-
ance to a Five Guinea Brooch of the sterling metal.
This offer holds good for a few weeks only, and is
made as much for the purpose of advertising our
Oriental Jewellery by sample as for any other
reason ; for the Brooches will keep, and they are
of the latest design. “ To see is to want,” is a
saying so applicable to our goods, that it pays us,
m the long run, to forward to any person a sample
Brooch at cost price. Examine our catalogue, and
write to us or call on us for what you may desire.

Opera House— “ London Assurance” ib.
Gaiety Theatre—” Moths ” ib.
Academy oe M usxc—Federal Minstrels ib.
Belmobb Park— Woodyear’s Circus ib.
A trifle more than ordinary interest was
aroused in the small minds of the theatre habitues
by the production of “Moths” at the Gaiety,
partly because some sympathy is felt for Mr.
Reeve (he will act) who has been singularly unfor-
tunate, and partly because the adaptation of
Ouida’s iibidinous legend was announced to
have been executed by Mr. Leopold Jordan, a
recent literary importation, who is partially con-
cealed in gloves and partially covered with glory.
We went to see “Moths” because we knew you
would want us to tell you something about it. AYe
knew this, because you weren’t out yourself to
any great extent—pr obably having learned by sad
experience that it is better to wait for our verdict
than to trust yourself in the hands of a local play-
wright. But you needn’t have stayed away from
the Gaiety on this account, for “ Moths ” is better
than a lot of dramas that have been brought all
the way out from home and had a successful run
in the colonies. We confess that we had our sus-
picions as to Mr. Jordan’s literary abilities, and
fully expected to have to recommend him to a
more rigid training with a wood-saw or a pick and
shovel, for he wrote a farce for the Minstrels not
long ago that came very near killing the business
and sending Hiscocks off on a provincial tour. But
he has agreeably surprised us, and we want to see
you out in full force to-night (Thursday) and to-
morrow night.
• • *
There are a lot of people who have never
read “Moths” in the original, and to them we
must say that it is the most powerful of Ouida’s
works. The plot, in brief, is that Lady Dolly, a
society moth, has succeeded in rearing a very
pretty daughter, Vera, in the country. At the ago
of 16 the girl, who is high-principled and above all
Ideas of hypocrisy, is introduced to Parisian
society, where an old Russian Prince falls in love
with her and wants to marry. Of course the giddy
head of Lady Dolly is turned by this, although her
daughter loathes the Prince and loves the Marquis
de Correze, a famous and wealthy opera singer.
Then the mother, the Prince, and a lot of auxilia-
ries conspire to secure Vere for the Prince. No-
thing moves the girl until her mother on bended
knees implores her daughter to save her, as
she has been a wicked, sinful woman and her
reputation is entirely at the mercy of the Prince.
And right here we want to tell Mr. Jordan
that the weakest point in his play is the fact
that he doesn’t bring his intriguing out with
sufficient distinctness to catch the sympathies of
the audience for his heroine. Vera should be posed
as a martyr, the victim of all sorts of cruelty and
deceit. Instead of that, after she marries the Prince
she goes about with black lines under her eyes and
never smiles except on somebody else than her hus-
band. All this time the Prince is trying to ‘make up’
to her. trying to please her, and telling her of his
love. Finally, he gets tired of that kind of a wife,
and proceeds to rule the roost with an iron hand.
And the audience sympathise with him rather
than with her, for there isn't a man in Sydney
who wouldn’t hammer hades out of such a wife,
or else shoulder his swag and slope for good. But
this defect In the play may be easily reme-
died by the introduction of a few lines here
and there, and there is no telling to what
success the piece may attain. Mr. Jordan, with
pardonable weakness, has introduced a few little
jokes of his own; and we can conscientiously state
that there is nothing in these pleasantries of his
which would be calculated to bring up a blush to
the cheek of anyone—but the author. There was,
in the course of the play, the usual wrestling with
and throwing the unfortunate French language.
What principally puzzled the players, seemed to
be the word Monsieur: it was pleasantly varied as
“ Mushoo,” “ Moshoo,” “ Merceer,” “ Afoonseer,”
and not unfrequently “ Moosher.” In sentimental
passages, however, Miss Knight usually adopted
the form “ Mer-sboo”—a rendering whicn appeared
to perfectly satisfy an audience which was of an
essentially “friendly.” character.
♦ * *
The representation of the piece was of a
rather bizarre nature, but Instructive, withal—since
during the unfolding of the fable, we were treated
to the delineation of numerous phases of character,
both native and foreign, which were new to us,
despite a somewhat careful study on our part of
the denizens of Great Britain and the Continent.
We tried hard, for instance, to fancy Mr. Edwin
Palmer, who played Prince Zouroff, a Russian
noble. We don’t know, of course, what mana-
gerial instructions Mr. Palmer received relative to
his make-up; but, as it was, ho appeared the very
counterpart of Nick La Feuillade—a compliment
which, we trust, that distinguished musician will
not fail to duly appreciate. It is said that when
the Allies’ foreign prisoners were in England their
.British guards, by way of making themselves the
more easily understood, were wont to converse
with the unfortunate captives in broken English;
and, indeed, Mrs. Plornish, it will be remembered,
conversed with Cavalleto invariably in a dialect of
her own, chiefly composed of distorted Bleeding-
heart Yard phrases. Mr. Palmer is evidently a
disciple of Mrs. Plornish, and, though he adopt ; a
peculiar vernacular, it is but fair to state that he
appears to be frequently understood by the other
characters. As Mr. Palmer is labelled a Russian
i we che erfully accept him as such; and are
glad to be able to state that his acting is away
ahead of his dialect.

It is a matter ot regret to us, who love
everything that is aesthetic and that is beautiful,
who have outlived our love for opera bouffe
“pages,” our passion for “ Pretty Blue Eyes,” and
burnt cork “ witticisms ”—it is a matter of regret
to us, we say, that the condition of the Opera
House on Monday night goes some way to indicate
that, lovely as Miss de Grey is, classic as her reper-
toire is, nice, clean, and clover as her company are,
a grovelling and dastardly public appear to have
grown callous to the fact, that, at Mr. Wilson’s
theatre, for 5s. or 3s. or 2s. or Is. they can be edu-
cated, elevated, and amused. Miss de Grey
started with a big boom, and it was con-
sidered by many that the dramatic reaction on the
part of the public being so strongly developed, it
would soon be incumbent upon the fair Marie to
show either in the Exhibition Building or in Wyn-
yard-square, in order to accommodate the crowds
which would flock to mentally feed on the old
English comedies. Butanol All of a sudden, the
beef-eating grovellers hold back, and the loan of
Joe Browne’s ulster becomes a necessary ad-
junct to comfort in the dress-circle.

There are many reasons for accounting
for the sudden collapse of public patronage. It
might be because “ An Unequal Match ” is more of
an unequal comedy than an “old’’one; the non-
appearance of Beach in a private box might, per-
haps, account for the poverty of the attendance;
Mrs. Chippendale being out of the cast might
possibly have kept away a few admiring millions
of the “ legitimate ”; and we consider that, taking
into account the elevated class of the entertain-
ment, the managemement committed a grave error
in not having it announced as under the patronage
and in the presence of Mr. Dan. O’Connor. The
fact, however, remains that the push stayed away
witn a “ unanimity ” that was “ remarkable.”
However, we went—partly as a representative of
the aristocracy, and partly to answer the call of
duty. And we had an entertainment, the perfume
of which is still upon us. It was calm, pleasant.
unexciting, and demure; and, as we used to say to
the hostess when our nurse came to fetch us away
from a juvenile party, we thank Miss do G. for "a
very pleasant evening.”
• • 9
“ An Unequal Match ” is by Tom Taylor,
who was art critic of the Times, editor of London
Punch (in which he used to print his own blood-
curdling In Memoriam verses), and the author of
about 150 plays, the origin of each one of which
can, as some polite critic delicately put it, “be
traced to a foreign source.” The interest of this
play is centred in one Hester Qrazebrook (Miss
de Grey), who (appropriately enough in this in-
stance)
Gives up her milk-walk and marries a swell,
Leaves for a mansion her sweet rustic dell.
Gets jealous, and wants to go back to her delf,
And triumphs by being a fine flirt herself.
And in connection with the milk-maid business,
we may suggest that the extreme brightness of
Miss De Grey's milk-pall is, to the eye of the artist,
less suggestive of the cow than the pump. Alfred,
in his paper, said that Miss de Grey’s impersona-
tion of Hester Grazebrook was a “ pleasing ” one;
upon which, of course, the fair artist at once
ordered a brick to be scented with patchouli, and
covered with satin, keeping it on a majolica pedes-
tal until an opportunity arrives to drop it. Hav-
ing the elegant missile in view, we don’t say Miss
Marie’s was a “pleasing” study of Hester, we pre-
fer rather to say that it was a perfumed one. It
was a charming thing to see her pretending to be
a rustic, and then, ail of a sudden, flashing into a
fine lady; only the next instant to—presto I—meta-
morphose herself into the milk-maid again. It
was, if not strictly artistic, at least protean.

The thinness of the house, or something
they had had for dinner, evidently had a dispirit-
ing effect upon some of the subordinate members
of the company, though Miss Florence Cowell
made quite a hit as Mrs. Montressor, in the quarrel
scene in the second act. Mr. Morton Selten, a
particularly picturesque gentleman, was Harry
Arncllffe, and a very good Harry Arncllffe, too.
Mr. Selten is quite the antithesis of most jeunes
premiers, who, as Leon Gozlan says, sont toujours
pales, whereas Mr. Selten is a stage “spoon”
of the x’Obust order. The Blenkinsop of Mr.
Mark Kinghorne was infinitely entertaining ;
though it must be admitted that the comic fat
ladled out to him by the author was ivery con-
siderable. The Doctor Botcherby of Mr. J. P.
West (of London and Dubbo) was a performance
which simply amounted to a dramatic nightmare.
His get-up was such that he looked considerably
less like a medical man than a lightning calculator,
his hat, in the first act, being an agonizing castorial
reproach. Mr. J. A. Patterson (of the principal
West-end theatres and Jamberoo) was funny as
Tofts, the comic groom; and Mr. A. T. Hilton
exhibited, some genuine comedy power as the
; Farmer Grazebrook. We don’t want to say any-
1 thing about the rest. And, as we don’t want to,
we shan’t.

Little Blanche Murray, the “ Miss Melville”
j of Mr. Hiscocks’ Girards, died last Thursday morn-
ing. Miss Blanche was a very clever, pretty, and
promising little girl, and adds another to the roll
of those who have succumbed to Minstrelsy. Her
funeral was not attended by the “ profession,” we
regret to say; most of the male members of that
distinguished calling having previous engagements
at “ wall-polishing,” “ heading-’em,” and religious
observances of similar tendencies. A few lines
You’ve gone up where the sky Is blue—
We almost wish, dear, we were you !—
Up there, there are no frosts or snows,
No Minstrels, sweetest Blanche, or shows.
Up there, amidst the skies, there are
No concerts that are “popular.”
And, Blanche, above that sun-gilt roof,
There is—just think!—no op’ra bouffe.
Oh, little angel, yes, we do,
We really wish that we were you.

' The revival of “The Mascotte” for a week
at the Theatre Royal was not unexpected, inas-
much as it was known that there had been a row
between the chorus and the management, the up-
shot being that quite a troupe of the weak-knee’d
and hollow-eyed sailed away to join Majeroni In
Melbourne. However, things are fixed up all right
now, and another week of “ The Mascotte.” what-
ever effect It may have upon the public, will
enable Mr. Searrelle the better to build up his
opera. The present re-revival of “ La Mascotte ”
is chiefly remarkable for the gymnastic efforts of
Miss Nellie Stewart to compass the music allotted
to Bettina. This clever little woman has been
worked so hard that she is fairly fatigued, and it
would be a charitable action on the part of the
management to give Miss Nellie a rest, and let her
give the public one. Miss Fannie Liddiard (whom
we expect to see in grand opera soon) is also tired,
and we should be glad to hear of her taking a well-
earned rest, too—at Madagascar. Mr. Woodfleld
played his old part of the Prince the same as ever,
and Mr. Howard Vernon made a delightfully
lively Pippo. The Duke of Mr. John Wallace
would have been full of “gay conceits” if the
conceits had been gay—but they were not. As
a songster, Mr. Wallace Is rather below the
calibre of those distinguished vocalists. Day
I and Harwood, though the steam-file rasp of
his high C could hardly be compassed by either of
those gentlemen. The other of the lady performers
who appeared were the familiar Maggies, Aggies,
and Idas, and the gifted Grundy showed as Sassa-
fras in the old familiar style.

As a matter of fact, the only really artistic
representation in the opera was that of Rocco, by
Mr. Kelly, which is a pure eccentric comedy study,
brimming over with fun, and replete with artistic
by-play. But what is one Saul amongst so many
prophets ?

On Saturday, “Estrella,” which we shall
spread ourselves out upon. Before we go, how-
ever, we would tearfully ask tbe management to
have the dress-circle gas-globes washed. They’d
be an eye-soro even to a critic with a sore eye. The
job, anyhow, would be a throw-in for the trage-
dians who appear to earn a living wearing out the
woodwork of Eastway’s public-house.

Ever since the time when Satan tumbled
out of heaven and got locked up for impertinence,
the human family have continued to take a lively
interest in gymnastic performances. We believe
that the devil is part human—at least we are sure
that humanity is part devil, so you can have it as
you like. Later on in history we find Adam turn-
ing handsprings out of the Garden of Eden; and,
still later, we read how Noah tumbled out of bed
in the ark. Of course, the old tub was rocking
about a good deal, and Noah had been celebrating
the successful launching of his bark in sundry
glasses of wine; but the impartial reader of
ancient history must be led to the suspi-
cion at once that Mrs. Noah had her back
to ithe wall, and her feet just a little below the
plane where Noah’s waistcoat buckled behind. As
we come further down, we read of Daniel, the
great lion-tamer, who tumbled into a cave amongst
a lot of wild beasts. This was probably the most
successful tumbling in all history, and had theie
been a daily critic on the ground, he would have
written:—" The performance was more than even,
and needed only to be seen to be appreciated.”
Then there was Lot’s wife, who turned, and has

There is an advertisement running through
all the country papers, but, curiously enough,
through none of the town ones—which we exceed-
ingly admire. The advertisement In question an-
nounces the forthcoming appearance of a publica-
tion which is to be 13s. (“strictly in advance”), and
which is to be delivered, without the intermedia-
tion of agents, alike to “ the lonely shepherd,”
“the adventurous back-blocker (sic), and the en-
terprising (sic) squatter.” “It will be left alike,”
says the ad., “ on the threshold of a hut, and in
the entrance of a mansion.” For his 13s. (strictly
in advance), the “adventurous back-blocker” is
to be further endowed with “a Christmas Annual,”
which is to contain (mark this!) “amongst other
novelties (I) a thrilling (sic) story by the late
Charles Dickens, never before published in Austra-
lia!” So many of the late Charles Dickens s
tories (“thrilling” and otherwise) have been
published in Australia, that the lattter announce-
ment solved all doubts (if, Indeed, any had really
existed In our minds) as to the genuineness of the
concern. Owing to the high prevailing price ot
jam, we are unable to invest thirteen shillings
ourselves; butassoonas these tempting publica-
tions shall have arrived in the hands of any on©
richer (and more enterprising) than ourselves, we
shall be glad to peruse them in an interval of
greasing the machinery.

“ A sudden death took place at Mrs. Tur-
ner’s Hotel, Narribri, last Wednesday. A man
named M’Gulre was at dinner, and having at-
tempted to swallow a piece of moat which was

minutes afterwards.” This comes of promoting
one of Alfred’s bards to the editorship of the

Under the heading “Another Impostor,”
the Evening News says:—“From our Mudgee
correspondence we learn that a big impostor has
j been palming himseif off in Mudgee as a reporter
of the Eatening Neavs, and on the strength of this
people have gladly taken him in during the last
fortnight, and not only given him board, but
money. He has cleared out now that his impos-
ture has been discovered, and he is probably gull-
ing somebody else.” According to this, the
Mudgee people, if they can’t tell an Evening
News man when they sea him, have, at any rate,
a tolerably clear idea of what the genuine man
would be likely to expect. Board and money!

One “Montrose” forwards us a poem on
‘ The Champion Contest.” It is an exciting pro-
duction, but, it anything, a trifle too classical for
our taste. He says:— , , . „
“ Each bravely strives with steady stroke and full
(sic ),
And h'nv to bow the champion oarsmen pull.”
It occurs to us that “ Montrose ” has taken out
too much license here. Our experience is that
oarsmen don’t pull bow to bow at all. This is pro-
bably because if they did the length of time re-
quired for a sculling match would be excessive?
This is a fine burst, though;—
“ Uhdo’a Point appears, and, verging slow ahead,
Hanlan is seen to have by little led.”
We can also recommend the following with confi-
dence:—
“ A laboured breathing scarcely strikes the ear,;
All silence honor, as from inf elt fear.”
We should like to have another poem from Mon-
trose. We should, indeed. That is, if it does not
take him too long away from the dye-tub to make
’em. And when he brings the MS., he can take
back our last Summer's pants in the cart.

One of thegood, old-fashioned, rouseabout
weddings we often read about, but seldom see,
was successfully pulled off at Bealiba, Avoca dis-
trict, Victoria, on Wednesday week, the bride being
a giddy, gushing young thing of 65 summers, and
the bridegroom a son of La Belle France who had
successfully withstood the assaults of all female
charms for 54 years, only to yield up his sword at
last and retire from the conflict vanquished.
During the hitching ceremony, the frisky bride
was so tickled at something that she giggled
continually, and was only brought to a more
staid demeanour by the clergyman informing
her that if she didn’t hold her “ yap ” he
would pack up and go home, and leave her
neither a maid, wife, nor widow, but a half-married
nondescript, as it were, “ for the hand of scorn to
point his slow, unmoving Unger at.” At night,
the flour and poultry doings were calculated to
bring moisture to the lips of even a wooden god;
and, when the blissful hour of sweet repose came,
quite a classical tone was given to the shivoo by a
crowd of miscellaneous choristers armed with
kerosene-tins, bullock-bells, etc., ranging round
the bed-room window and enthusiastically yelling
the only song known about the Bealiba district,
viz., “ Old John Brown lies mouldering in his
grave.” It was a trifle rough on the ancient
groom inside, but it was the only epithalamium
his friends knew, and they gave him plenty of it.
Verily it taketh a Government department
to mess things up most thoroughly. An edict has
just gone forth from the Minister of Works to the
effect that children, who are not in arms, travelling
on the trams will be charged for at half-rate for
the future. Lest this should seem too rough on
prolific parents, however, it has been thought ad-
visable that a month’s notice should be given of
the date when the new rule will be brought into
operation. Here’s where the laugh comes in, how-
ever, Printed instructions to enforce this charge
were issued to the ticket-collectors three months
ago; but as most of the married guards had young-
sters themselves (and the unmarried hoped to have
at some future date), good nature proved too
strong for discipline, and a seatful of tow-heade ,
taffy-punishing urchins were passed along under
the sheltering mgis of mamma’s “ tuppenny

The antediluvian style our telegraphic

“ How is it there’s to be no performance
to-night?” enquired he of Jones, the eminent tra-
gedian, who stood disconsolately at the theatre
door. “ Because there’d be no one to see us,”
mournfully answered Jones. “Why, I thought
you were doing good business. You’ve had a full
nouse every night.” “ Yts, so we have,” answered
Jones; “but, unfortunately, to-night we haven’t
got money enough to buy paper to print the
orders on.”
one of our cerulean-blooded swells might have
toddled home with a cracked neck, and twelve
good men and true would have had to sit
on his head for half a day in order to fabri-
cate a verdict to the effect that the party
underneath came to his death from injuries acci-
dently received; no blame being attached to any-
one, of course. Apropos of this, some saw-dust-
brained Solomon on the Echo sapiently says: “ Is
it not a reasonable suggestion that while the wires
are kept ’suspended in mid-air all alterations and
repairs should be effected between the midnight
and the dawn.” Of course it is. And, therefore,
when a break again occurs on the Sydney-Mel-
bourne line at 9 on a Friday morn, the officials will
do well to take the Echo messer’s advice, and let
the business rip until Saturday morning’s dawn.

BOIBOROQGH Hill,
THE PROPERTF OF
E. J. WEHLOW,
In consequence of his approaching departure for Europe, Mr. E,
J. Wehlow has decided to place his magnificent estate at Baulkam
Hills, know as Roxborough Hall, in the market. It is now adver-
tised for sale by
W. A. BRODIE, AUCTIONEER, PARRAMATTA.
The property, which comprises an area of about 200 acres of the
richest soil, is one of the snuggest and most desirably situated in the
country, and is acknowledged to be admirably adapted to
ORANGE AND FRUIT GROWING.
It is located about four and a half miles from Parramatta, has
frontages to both the Castle Hill and Baulkham Hills roads, and is
substantially enclosed. Prom the commanding eminences of the
Estate
CHARMING VIEWS
are te be obtained of the far-famed
BLUE MOUNTAINS,
The City, Suburbs, Parramatta, and surrounding districts. About
seventy acres are cropped with oranges, lemons, summer fruit, oats,
barley, lucerne, turnips, peas, beans, etc., all of which flourish most
luxuriantly in the fertile soil of the locality. The residence is a
handsome and commodious building, is very healthily situated, and
contains fifteen lofty and well-ventilated rooms. The out-buildings
are very complete, and include stables, coachhouse, conservatory,
aviary, fernery, labourers’ cottages, dairy, stock-yard, piggery,
fowl-houses, and yard, etc. The laundry and other appliances are
ample for all requirements, an abundance of pure water is stored in
underground and other tanks, and, in addition to large tanks and
dams distributed throughout the estate,-a never-failing creek runs
right through the property. The grounds .surrounding the proprie-
tor's house are very prettily laid out witli plants, flowers, and evei-
greens of the choicest kinds, the drives being planted with hand-
some pine, oak, laurel, chestnut, Moreton Bay fig, and other trees.
The estate is one of the most desirable in the country, and the lucky
purchaser of it could live surrounded by ease and luxury, and, at
the same time, realise a handsome fortune from the produce of the
soil.
FOR FULL PARTICULARS, APPLY TO
W. A. BRODIE,
PARRAMATTA.

The committee appointed to inquire into
the iniquities of the London “City Livery Com-
panies ’* has disclosed the sickening fact that
£100,000 a year is spent in "entertainments” by
these bloated Guilds, as they are called. A small
clique of gourmands (for the Liverymen chiefly
confine their hospitalities among their own pre-
cious selves) literally »wallow up £350 every work-
ing day in banquets, withii i hearing of the “ Bitter
Cry of Outcast London:” and this, mind you, is
the surplus compouna interest of money originally
bequeathed for charitable purposes and the ad-
vancement of trade. —
Poor starving wretches sink and die,
And Outcast London’s Bitter Cry
Throughout the world resounds.
Yet, year on year, these gluttons meet
In City Halls, to drink and eat
One hundred thousand pounds.
At the very top of the huge building
known as the new General Post Office in 8t. Mar-
tin’s-le-Grand, is the.Central Telegraph Office of
London. It is worth a word or two. There are
636 sets of telegraph apparatus in that one room.
In one year 14% millions of telegrams passed
through it. The same year, 89 millions of words
were sent in “ press ” messages only. On the nights
of Important parliamentary debates, it is not un-
usual for half a million of words to be sent,
sufficient to fill 250 newspaper columns. Ruch an
event as the University boat-race, or the Derby, is
known all over the United Kingdom three minutes
after the judge’s decision. The total staff of clerks
in the office is 1700; the most at work at one time
is about 1000; the fewest, about70-thatis, between
3 a.m. and 7 a.ra. Of machines, there are 190
duplex, 54 Wheatstone automatic, 12 quadruplex,
148 single needle, 244 single Morse, &c. All manu-
script messages from the House of Commons, three
miles distant, are sent to the office through pneu-
matic tubes.
With a go-ahead spirit which stands out
gloriously by the side of our own dull, pottering,
flve-thousand-years-behind-the-time policy, the
Victorian telegraph authorities have reduced
their chargee to a penny a word, and foreigners
are allowed to correspond in their own language.
And as a sample of what a cheerful picnic the
lightning dodgers will have over there in future,
we may mention that the German word “ Staats-
achuldenzahlungscassebuchhalter ” consists of 37
letters, and means “Accountant of the bureau
where the State debts are paid,” and as German
etiquette demands that everyone should be ad-
dressed by his full title, we can easily imagine with
what 40 horse-power fervour the key-puncher will
bless the Teuton who hands in a six word “wire,”
containing 233 letters, and topped by an! address
(which goes free) consisting of 13 words of 48
letters each, and rounded off by a signature as
long as a bullock-driver’s whip, and a hundred
times more kinky. However, it is greatly to the
credit of the Victorian authorities, to find they
are willing to sacrifice their own comfort for the
convenience and benefit of the public.
A Melbourne gentleman and a Wesleyan
has been tearing his lank locks because the Wes-
leyan Church, Yarravllle, was engaged by some-
one for the purpose of delivering an election
address—from the pulpit, presumably. Says this
good man: “ I hold that it is always unwise to let
buildings that have been dedicated to the service
of God for any secular purposes.” Exactly, and
that’s just the reason we object to some of the
giddy goings-on in the vestries—not that it’s any
use objecting, because parsons will have their
little larks the same as other people, if not more
so. And, alas, for the Wesleyan gentlemen! If no
building dedicated to the service of God were ever
attended for secular purposes, what poor houses
the parsons would have to play to—especially on
Sunday evenings.—
At many a church and at many a chapel
Much secular work goes on, don’t you know ?
The schoolboy drops in to dispose of an apple,
The maiden goes there to make eyes at her beaux;
The merchant reflects on his “lines” for the mor-
row,
As he piously sits in the family pew :—
Yes, we oftentimes think, to our infinite sorrow,
That worshippers are most uncommonly few.
The latest thing in bicycles is called the
“Kangaroo Safety Bicycle.” The “Kangaroo,”
of which the following is an illustration, has
only a three-foot wheel, the head is open, and
a circular tube descends on each side of the wheel
from the handle bar to the bearings of the crank
and chain wheel. The short arms carrying the
bearings of the front wheel are strongly clamped
on to the tubular forks, which, from these points
downwafds, are double —one tube within another
—to give greater strength. Thus, while the axle
of the front wheel is some 2)fs inches in front of
the fork, the p< dais are kept fairly well under the
rider. On each side of the driving wheel is a
toothed flange—part of the hub, in fact—carrying
seven teeth. A chain passes over each ox these
flanges, and also over the wheel attached to each
pedal crank, this wheel being furnished with tw elve
teeth. These chains have, of course, no connec-
tion with each other, except through the driving
wheel, and the number of teeth on the lower chain
wheel compared with those on the hub give a
greatly accelerated movement to the driving
wheels relatively to the pedals; in the case of the
machine we have been trying the speeding up is
equal to a 63-lnch wheel. The handle bar is 28
inches wide, and hollow, and the method of con-
nection with the bearings through the tubular
fork gives wonderful rigidity to the steering. The
rear wheel is 23 inches in diameter, and is covered
with a serviceable mud guard; a low step also de-
scends from the hind fork. The saddle is carried
on an Arab cradle spring, and a powerful spoon
brake, with a grip handle, is furnished to the front
wheel. A pair of comfortable foot-rests are also
provided, extending out in front of the axle on
either side of the wheel. The tread of the pedals is
no broader than in the ordinary bicycle, as the small
size of the wheel enables it to be built much nar-
rower than would be safe in a wheel of larger diame-
ter. The “ Kangaroo ” is a product of Messrs. Hill-
man, Herbert, and Cooper’s manufacturing works
at Coventry. Says a writer in the Fiejvd : “I have
ridden the ' Kangaroo ’ about 300 miles, including
two rides of 104 and 100 miles, occupying 11% hours
and 11% hours respectively. I am confirmed in my
opinion that the machine is propelled as easily a
au ordinary bicycle, for, in spite of the high gear-
ing, favouring the attainment of great speed on
the level and down hill, I drove it up every hill
on the above-mentioned rides, which were, in one
case, from London to Birmingham by Dunstable
and Towcester, and, in the other, from Leicester
to London by Northampton, Bedford, and Hitchin,
and many of these hills are sufficiently severe to
claim serious attention from bicyclists. It is from
facts of this kind that I prefer to form an
opinion upon the merits or faults of bicycles
or tricycles, as 1 consider such facts to be the
only reliable means by which the qualities
and detects of these machines are discoverable.”
Th- objection to the small wheel hitherto has been
that the writer had to pedal painfully fast to ob-
tain an average speed, and that the rider’s legs
were too cram ued to exert their lull power. W ith
the “ Kangaroo,” however, these drawbacks are
reduced, as the treadles are lowered to give the
rider a straight Jeg in driving and are brought
back enough to allow of a fair vertical tread. The
“ safety ” consists in the small wheel, in order that
the rider be near the ground, and in the centre of
the s«ddle being ton or twelve inches behind a per-
pendicular line passed through the axle, so that in
the event of the machine striking an obstruction
there is very little danger of the rider shooting
forward.
WONDERS OF THE AGE.
Why is it so many people are never satisfied ?
Their homes are marvels of comfort and luxury,
friends are generous and affectionate ; they are
educated and refined, capable, not only of enjoy-
ing, but of imparting happiness to others; yet
they are dissatisfied, miserable, and, really without
intending to do so, make others miserable. Their
blood is impure, they have taken a heavy cold, or
they are bilious. A few doses of Emil Prese’s
Hamburg Tea would remove all obstructions, and
enable them to enjoy, with renewed zest, the plea-
sures they are now compelled to forego.
FOR THE GUIDANCE OF OTHERS.
Glenmore Road, Paddington,
14th January, 1884.
Gentlemen,—Some few weeks since I was so
severely affected with indigestion as to render my
rising each morning a matter of difficulty and
pain on account of severe pains in the back; and
it had just become necessary for me to take a holi-
day from my work, for the performance of which
I was by no means fit, when a friend mentioned to
me the benefit he derived from the use of Ham-
burg Tea. In the hope of getting some relief, I
used it myself, the result being that I was myself
in three or four days, and have not suffered since.
My friends have advised me to write this for the
guidance of others, and you are at liberty to make
w hat use you please of this.
Yours,
JOHN KELLY.
Messrs. Elliott Bros., Sydney.

SPORTING AND ATHLETIC MEMS.
The further development of the Hanlan-
Beach imbroglio will be found in another column.
In the first innings of the Canterbury match
Spofforth bowled eighteen overs, fifteen maidens,
three runs, and two wickets in an hour.
Tn a recent college match, at Cambridge,
Mr. C. W. Rock, the Tasmanian, scored 202 out of
436, and took six wickets, in eight and a half overs,
for 6 runs.
J. Phizackerley rode well on Saturday last,
but the task set him in the Mile Maiden Handicap
was too great. May the gods forgive Phizackerley
senior, for propagating more of the name —for we
cannot.
A quoit match took place at Ned Punch’s
Captain Cook Hotel, Moore Park, on Saturday last,
between Baker and Pile, 61 up, clay ends, for a
“tenner” aside. Baker won by 61 to his oppo-
nent’s 49.
Efforts to bring about another set of
matches between George and Myers, the cham-
pion amateur runners of England and America
respectively, have failed, as each man only wants
to run at his own distance.
That was a fiendish statement made by
the Melbourne Sportsman— that Beach measured
18 and 16 inches respectively round the biceps and
forearm. We notice tho New Zealand papers have
copied it in all seriousness.
Andy Dillon, our crack handball player,
slipped down stairs, the other day, and broke his
collar-bone. The accident happened most unop-
potunely, as Andy had in contemplation a trip to
Melbourne, to play in some big matches.
England is all behind in trotting. In a
match at Manchester, for a trophy which virtually
carries with It the English championship, Nellie
Patchen trotted a mile and a half in 3min. 58sec.,
or at tho rate of, say, 2mln. per mile.
James W. Raby, the English champion,
offers to walk any man m the world from three
miles to twelve miles, for any sum up to *100 a
side. Now, then, Mr. Watson, the honour and glory
of Australia is at stake, and only a paltry hun-
dred this time I
During the three days of the match Eng-
land v. Australia at Lord’s In July, 35,501 Passed
through the turnstiles. As each person paid bd.,
tho takings at the gate amounted to £887 10s. bd.—
a very pleasant sum to console Billy and his merry
men for their defeat.
In England, the Philadelphian cricketers
played 18 matches (eight wins, five defeats, and
rive draws). It was stated from the first that the
object of the trip was “purely educational.
When they want a finishing lesson they’ll probably
apply to Murdoch and Co.
Mr. Middleton is a bigger success on the
turf than on tho briny. H.a completely swept the
board in tho long-distance races on Saturday, and
by reasan of his easy wins the races were robbed
of all interest. It seems strange the handicappers
were so poorly posted with the capabilities of the
men.
It is pretty well certain that W. G. George’s
11 miles 932 yards is the greatest well-authenticated
hour’s running feat. When Deerfoot did his al-
leged 11 miles 970 yards, each quarter-mile of the
running-track was shortened by some conspirators
to the extent of half-a-dozen yards-at least, so it
Is stated.
What a pity the lolanthe was not large
enough to attempt the trip out with, and the
Mignonette small enough to pack away on a steam-
boat; or, to put it another way, that Mr. Want did
not purchase the lolanthe, and Mr. Smith the
Mignonette. We utter this wish In thoi interests ot
Tort Jackson yachting.
W. Raynor, of Salford, is stated to be the
coming English sprinter. At the BlaokJey Sports
he was credited with running 115hs yards In llMj
boo., or half a yard better than evens. But out
here, where alleged evens are as plentiful as
blackberries, tho performance will no doubt he
considered nothing out of the common.
The Australasian is responsible for the
statement that the billiardlst, a. Evans, recently
ran together a break of 1989. We suppose this
break was made something on the sarae line as
our wonderful time trials on the Parramatta. We
trust, for Weiss’ sake, he will not make moire than
a dozen of them duriikg the play for Alcock’s tour-
nament.
Small attendance and plenty of dust a t the
Liverpool races ou Saturday last. Dr. Cortls’
Chesterton won the Hurdle; A. Smee’s T irate
carried off the Plying Handicap; Kelso’s Bs-own
Eagle won the two-year-old Selling Stakes; .Paul
cantered in tho winner of the Selling Race; and J.
Cannon's Merlin defeated Ellington for the Liver-
pool Handicap.
“Him clever!” said Johnny Jacobs, .the
bookmaker, in tones of deep disgust. “ His clobl >er
may be all down the frog, and he may part 1 ua
Barnet in the I’ll ask you; butclever!” Andtlaen
old Abe, who was standing by, shrieked, wht n
corrected in his grammar by the sporting re-
porter: “What! me misuse Lindley Murray ?
Why, I tell you straight that I don’t even knot v
the fellow by sight.”
The English 20-miles professional cham-
pionship was won by Howell by a yard anff
a half from Wood, Lees half a yard behind the
second man. Keen led for 18 miles, when he re-
tired. Tim®, 63m. 13 3-5aec. The international 25-
mdes championship was won by H. Battensby, the
50-miles Champion, H. O. Duncan, ,of Bordeaux,
second. D® Civry, the French Champion, was
fourth. The winner’s time, Ihr. 17m. 2i)4-6sec., is
the fastest on record for the distance.
We never hear the name of Dormelly and
Sullivan in connection with tho “bringing out”
of the “champion of the universe,” a ithough, to
our personal knowledge, It was fro' n the well-
known Glebe Point shed, and in boa cs belonging
to Donnelly and Sullivan, that William Beach first
made his (Ubut on metropolitan waters. He re-
mained in their hands, and was boated by them for
many months; and it was only after the Punch
trophy race showed what he really could do, that
others took him up. And yet, through all the
speechifying, we have never heard their names
mentioned. Why is this thus ?
The Philadelphian cricketers have been
entertained at dinner on board Nelson’s ship Vic-
tory at Portsmouth, and also at a oall given by
Admiral Hornby. The King of Sweden was among
the guests. We don’t notice anything about the
Australians being on board the Victory, or twirl-
ing on the light fantastic at the Admiral’s. How-
ever, it’s no doubt much better in the long run to
have plenty of gate-money and a “ square ’’ dinner
at the Tavistock, unfettered by the restraints ot
ultra-conventional society, than to simper among
raspberry ices and still colder maidens in the
charmed circle of a frigid aristocracy.
“ On 1st August, at Providence, thegelding
Jay-Bye-See trotted one mile in 2mm. lOsec. Next
day, at Cleveland, Mr. Vanderbilt’s mare Maud ».
trotted the same distance in 3min. This is
the fastest time on record, and the interest in the
event has temporarily eclipsed all other topics.”
We must some day, wo suppose, reach the limit
beyond which the speed of a norse or mare cannot
possibly go; but, until then, this constant repeti-
tion by Maud S. of “ fastest on records ” by a
quarter of a second or so will necessitate more
accurate subdivision of time. She might one day,
you know, do in it 3 minutes 9 and 47-hundredtns
of a second.
The three-mile bicycle handicap at the
Sydney Amateur Athletic Club sports was one of
the best-contested races we had seen for a long
time. Lambton’s machine went wrong during the
running, and he would have been out of It had
Phiz, not resigned his bike. The ground lost dur-
ing the exchange was sufficient to break an or-
dinary man’s heart; but Lambton went at it like a
well-bred ’un, gradually overhauled and passed
his men, and eventually won a race to be proud of
from W. C. Chapman. 100 yards; J. Thurlow, 50
yards, third. G. H. J, Hardwick did some grand
walking for the two-miles’ challenge cup. He beat
record time for both the mile and two miles, doing
the distances in 7min. lOJ-fjsec. and 15min. 19sec. re-
spectively.
The Yankee troupe of athletic amateurs
are catching it from tne English Press. On 36th
July they declined to compete at a meeting espe-
cially arranged for them at Liverpool, by the
South London Harriers, on account of the wet;
but, on the following Monday, the troupe put in
an appearance at Stourbridge, and entered with
spirit into the races with utter disregard of the
rain, which fell almost without cessation curing
the afternoon. Says Bull's Life: “This seems
rather rough ou the Harriers, unless, indeed, the
visitors have come to some arrangement whereby
they are now * on their own hook.’ ” From which
it is apparent to the naked eye that Myers and Co.
arc not running their show on the same lines as
those seraphs the Philadelphian cricketers.
In the first annual quarter-mile swimming
competition for the salt-water championship of the
world at Portsmouth, sixteen started for the race,
which was carried on in two heats and a final.
Sergeant, of Portsmouth, won the first heat in
6 min. 54isec.; and Cairns, of Liverpool, the second
easily in 7 min. 64 sec. In the final, which was
watched by thousands of spectators, including
representatives of all the principal swimming clubs
of England, most of whom sent delegates to com-
pete, Cairns won by half a yard. Time, 6 min. 33 sec.
Through a deviation from the course Sergeant lost
quite a couple of yards. Where are all the crack
Australian swimmers —the M'Indoes, the Corbetts,
the Cavills, and other representatives of the Mel-
bourne and Sydney clubs ? We hope to see Aus-
tralia represented next year.
The veteran pug, Joe Goss, is still alive
though not kicking, as he is stated to be paralysed
in the lower limbs. He bosses a whisky mill in
Boston. Joseph aspired to the championship, but
never reached that exalted position, although
when he defeated Tom Allen in America, they
tried to make out the match was for the champion-
ship. In 1863 he fought Mace for a thou., but the
Gipsy was too much for him, and won in 1 hour 55
minutes. The pair met again, when they stood
looking at each other for over an hour without
striking a blow, and the affair was called a draw.
In 1866 they met a third time, in a 16-foot ring, and
after fighting something over hall’-an-hour, Goss
was compelled to cry pec cavi. Joe, when in his
1 prime, stood 5ft. 8Min., and turned the scale a
,shade over ten stone and a half.
W. Read, of Glebe Point, has just finished
t&mberiHK a tlshing’ boat, built to tho order of
“Podge” Newton, an old Identity in connection
with open boats Id. Port Jackson. The boat under
myeice is 33 feet long, seven feet beam, and five
iratft'across the tuck; has a carvel bottom, and is
intended for a working fishing boat, though, from
the look of her, we should say “ Podge ’’ will have
a good mortgage on races for working boats
during the coming season. So soon as she is out
of the shed, Read will start a 33-foot racer, to the
order of Mr. Longtleld. It cannot be expected our
Donnellys, and Sullivans, and Ellises will last for
ever, and we ate glad to see any young uns
coming out likely to keep up the prestige ot Port
Jackson for open sailing ooats —the style of craft
eminently suited to our waters.
When we advocated, some time since, that
the Association Cricket Ground subscription would
not hurt for a slight raising, we did it with the idea
of compelling on-lookors to pay a little more for
their amusement, and not with the intention or
putting the “ screw ” on the already overtaxed
cricketers who provide the sport. Though two
guineas per annum may be none too much for the
outsiders who go in for the money’s worth of
amusement, we certainly consider it too stiff tor,
at all events, the unfortunates who belong to clubs
which pay their £25 per ann. for a practice wicket.
However, we look forward to tho good time when
the athletic clubs raise a ground of their own, and
when King Phil, and Co. will be glad to minister a
little more to rhe wishes of cricketers to whom the
Association Ground was dedicated.
The twenty-fifth meeting of the Sydney
Amateur Athletic Club eventuated on the Asso-
ciation Ground on Saturday last, in the presence
of a fair attendance. P. James won the 100 yards ;
B. Lupton won the quarter-mile maiden: W.
Howard won the mile walk from scratch; D. D.
Middleton ran away with tho half-mile in Sox.
74sec., the three-quarter handicap from scratch
in 3m. 264sec., and the mile handicap from scratch
in 5m. Isee.; E. Lupton, P. James, and D. J. Lenane
ran a dead heat for the 150 yards handicap; J.

The Beaoh-Hanlan negotiations are as
nothing compared to the efforts made by the Trea-
sury and Lands Departments to arrange a match
between their respective sculling champions. The
Lands came out first with an offer to back their
man for a trophy to the extent of a quid aside, but
the bong-tongers of Macquarie-street treated such
an offer with the scorn it deserved, and replied
that a sixty-guinea trophy, thirty a side, would be
the least at which their man would consent to
strip. And there the matter is supposed to stand;
but we have it from those who oughtto know, you
know, that the Lands men have decided to allow
tho matter to stand over till the first of the month,
when the office is to be canvassed, and if a fiver
can be raised, an effort will be made to fix up a
match for that amount. Thirty pounds, forsooth!
quoth one Lands man, why the very sight of such
a fabulous sum would be sufficient to send me on
the randan for a month—provided I could nego-
tiate with “tho Jews” for the wherewithal.
The pacers are knocking spots off the
trotters in America, so far as the records go. For
the benefit of those ignorant of the technical de-
tails, we may state with respect to the difference
between the two styles that whereas the trotter
moves near fore an i off hind —off fore and near
hind-together, the pacer goes in giraffe style, the
legs on each side acMng in unison. Difference in
time rates between trotting and pacing has until
now been small. At one period the pacing record
would be in front of that for trotting; then there
would be an upheaval the other way; then pacing
would get in front again; and so on and so on, the
rivalry being always fairly exciting. Maud S.
lifted the trotting record above that of pacing, but
in return Johnston beat the trotting record—by a-
quarter of a second only—and there the relative
merits of trotting and pacing rested until the day
when Westmont was harnessed in company with a
running mate to a wagon, July 10.1884, and re-
duced the record for pacing from 2mm. lOsec. to
2mln. IMsec.
The Notts County committee refused to
let any of their first eleven off for the match be-
tween the Players of England and the Australians
at the Oval on July 31. Notts, it may be remem-
bered, on that day met Gloucestershire. The
Would says “there, are too many Australian
matches,” and this little par. is printed for the edi-
fication of oft “ Kangaroos ” by a London news-
paper:—“When the Philadelphians visit Ports-
mouth on the 1st and 2nd August to play the
United Service Club, they will bo entertained in
barracks by the garrison regiments, and on board
Nelson’s old flagship the Victory by the naval offi-
cers of the nort. These cricketers were asked
what share of the gate-money they would like, and
replied at once, and decisively, none. The Aus-
tralians, on the contrary, do not visit Portsmouth
this season, on account, so it is said, of the Club
not being able to arrange financial matters to their
satisfaction.” When this was shown to Murdoch,
ho said “decisively”: “The Yankees evidently
know exactly how much it’s worth to see them
play."
The rowing men of England as at Henley
assembled last month issued a mean, pitiful, and
narrow-minded manifesto, unrivalled even in the
history of that paragon of shoddyism, the ama-
teur rowing-men definition. Among other items
of information, we again have the one thrust
upon us that “ no person shall be considered an
amateur oarsman, sculler, or coxswain who is
or has been by trade or employment for wages a
mechanic, artisan, or labourer, or engaged in any
menial duty.” This is building up a barrier with a
vengeance, so as to avoid contamination. The
very man who becomes Lord Chancellor may find
barred to him the sacred portalsjof amateur row-
ing. The late Charles Dickens was considered
good enough company for most men of rank and
talent; yet he, according to the story of his life as
told on his own authority, would, when at his best
and greatest, have been ineligible for membership
of an amateur rowing club. Not because the late
Charles ;Dickens was a mechanic, artisan, or
labourer—he never did anything as wicked as that
—but because he had at one time been, owing to
necessitous circumstances, and, as a small boy,
engaged in “menial duty.”
At the Madison Square Garden (U.S.), horse
show, the leaping competition appears to have
been a,wonderful performance, as “ Langtry”-Geb-
hardt’s horse Leo jumped 6ft. 61n. Six horses en-
tered for the contest, and all got over 4ft. 81n.
save one that refused. At 5ft. 51n. another horse
was ruled out. The remaining four cleared 5ft. Uin.
and 6ft. tin. was attempted. This height was cleared
by Leo and two others, and then the tremendous
height of 6ft Sin. was announced. Bets were
freely offered that none of the three horses left
would clear it. The Goat shied three times before
it, and dropped out of the contest. Then came
Leo’s turn, and he shied the first time. But the
second time he started at a canter, and rapidly in-
creasing his pace to a wild dash, he rose away into
the air and passed over the barrier, barely grazing
the top with his haunches, while the spectators
rose as of one accord, and cheered and cheered
again. Hempstead made three brave though un-
successful efforts to equal Leo’s feat, and fairly
earned the second prize. Leo was bred at Paris,
Ky., by Mr. James Frazer, who sold him to Mr.
Oliver Iselin, who in turn sold him about a year
ago to Mr. Gebhardt. The horse is six years old,
and stands 16 hands 3 inches. He has been trained
for the hunting field, and has had practice in it.
The Balmain Rowing Club may be con-
gratulated on the success of their afternoon’s
racing on Saturday last. The competitors were
attired in an out-of-the-way neat style, which
might well be copied by some of the other clubs,
and the arrangements were well carried out by
the executive, the only mistake being in having a
turn when Nature has been so lavish to them in the
way of a straightaway course. The race in skiffs
1 for the championship of the club was spoiled at
the turn, and although we believe the best man
won, the race was no test of it, as it was just as
likely for the worst, as the best man to get away
when they were all bunched up at the turning
point. J. and A. Fraser, J. Beadman, and J. H.
Read started. The four rowed all together for the
first half-mile, when Read drew out and reached
the turn first. J. Fraser and Beadman then came
up and a foul occurred, Read getting away
with a lead that enabled him to paddle over
the remainder of the course, an easy winner.
i A. Fraser, who was last to turn, passed Beadman
and his namesake while they were locked together,
and secured second place. A. Klnnamont, who
rowed in good style, won the race for members
under 10st.; T. R. Ainsworth, who is the makings
of a good sculler, won the contest for scullers
under list.; and the concluding race, for double
scullers, fell to Kinnamont and Peers.
Just listen to the voice of the charmer in
the London Daily Telegraph To Ulyett be-
longs the lion’s share of the credit, and his grand
performance in dismissing seven batsmen for an
average of a fraction over five runs per wicket
confirms the pretty generally accepted notion that
as a fast bowler he has few, if any, superiors. His
easy, faultless delivery enables him to attain a re-
markable degree of accuracy, whilst, from his
powerful physique, he can, and does occasionally,
put down perhaps a faster ball than any other
bowler. In addition to these valuable qualities,
Ulyett, like Spoffortb, is enabled to break the ball
considerably from the off, with this difference in
the Yorkshlreman’s favour, that, with a speedier
delivery, he breaks to a greater extent. Ulyett’s
difficulty is in regulating the length of pitch, of
which a distinct example was given in the prese >t
match. In the first innings of the Australians, he
appeared unable to getaway from pitching a short
length, and, as a result, his efforts were altogether
futile, whereas, in the second innings, from the
good length attained, he was almost unplayable.
He was to some extent assisted by a detective
wicket, which bumned frequently and danger-
ously. Several of tho Australian batsmen received
injuries of more or less severity, and Blackham so
much so that his services with the bat became un-
available shortly after making his appearance at
the wicket He himself was greatly to blame for
not using a batting glove upon his left hand.
Cool, isn’t it? Blackham says wrought-iron
armour of the Kelly pattern will soon be de
rigueur.
The facts of the “ground-rushing” affair
at the match between the Australians and the
Players on 1st August, were sinrply these:—The
second innings of the Players had concluded, and
the Australians had only to make 28 in order to
win. When 17 had been scored and one Australian
wicket was down, the luncheon-bell rang and the
teams proceeded to leave the field. Whereupon
the crowd, who strongly objected to wait through
the luncheon hour for the purpose of seeing
whether 11 runs could be scored by the nine re-
maining wickets, immediately conceived tho idea
that the Australians didn’t want to finish the
match at once for afternoon gate-money consi-
derations, and started to root up the stumps. Just
as if an Australian ever thought of gate money 1
Just imagine Spoff. wanting gate money! Next
day it was announced that the multitude hau
made a grave mistake, inasmuch as on the evening
of the first day of the match orders had been given
that no money should be taken at the gate after
mid-day of the morrow, The boys having thus
clearly proved an “alibi,” wo find them not
guilty,” with a strong recommendation to mercy.
At the same time, it’s impossible to overlook the
facts that though the second innings of the Players
was over at twenty-three minutes past one, the
Australian Innings, which according to law should
have started at 1.33, did not commence till 1.4b—
and that it is openly alleged by a great many people
who “ profess to know,” that the arrangement as
to “ no gate money after luncheon ” was quite an
afterthought. The excuse given by Murdoch him-
self appears to be that as the wicket was drying
and rapidly getting fast, he thought more eclat
would attend finishing the match after lunch-
Besides, in the words of Dr. Johnson, Billy liked
to lunch.”
After a cessation of them for a year or
more, the sixteenth quarterly sociable washeldai
the Sydney Gymnasium on Thursday night, as h
was complimentary, the audience generously con-
sented to fill all the chairs, and stand up at the
back. The platform was also full, and an Italian
string band relieved the tedium of muscular
monotony. Sharp at 8, D'Harcourt came out, ana
gave a really fine display of club-twisting. Then
a dozen of his young men appeared, and practised
on the horizontal bar. Some were pretty good,
but, on the whole, there was an uncertainty m
their movements which indicated that they wanted
to show off more than they could do; and even
what they could do was not done with that ease
and finish which ought to characterise a dis-
play in public. It is very evident that,
though all the young men are thirsting tor
cvmnastic glory, few of them have given tnar

A Frenchwoman says : “ For a refined

embarrassment of a witty man.”
Mrs. Weldon, the notorious London liti-

Young ladies now carry in their hats small

At Catford, Eng., a young fellow named
Avery shot himself dead, after writing, in a letter
to his brother; “Take my advice, and never have
anything to do with girls, or else you will lay
yourself open to have your heart broken like

on the average young man.
“ That is a beautiful young woman across
the way,” said a Parisian gentleman to his wife.
“ She is, indeed,” the lady assented, “ a remarkably
pretty woman.” “I wonder If the gentleman
whom she just now met is her husband?” “I
think he must be,” replied Madame; “I noticed
he didn’t lift his hat to her.”
There are only four Australiennes in Singa-

“I am shocked, my dear,’’ said a husband
at a ball the other evening, “that you should

In England, a woman went to bed and

A popular actress who, cholera notwith-
standing, has been spending her holiday at one of
those pretty but improper French watering-places,
tells how she visited a modiste’s there for the pur-
pose of purchasing, if possible, a ready-made bath-
ing costume. After examining several, she ex-
claimed, “ But none of the seams appear to be
securely stitched.” “Ah, that is so,” quickly re-
plied the saleswoman, wiih a cunning Jeer, “it is
on purpose; just one leetle accident, and madame
always gets an offer of marriage.” Just like those
naughty French.
A lady, fat, fair, and forty, stepped on to
the luggage scales at a railway station, and asked
the porter to adjust the weights. " About two
hundred pounds, mum, I should say you be,” was
that worthy’s remark by way of small-talk, as he
was adjusting the balances. He was right to a
pound. “ Dear me,” she asked, “ how did you
manage to make such a capital guess?” “well,
mum, you see, mum,” was the half apologetic re-
joinder, “I'm used to the guessing of weights.

he found the lady standing, with her lover on ais
knees before her, in the act of making an offer.

In England, the female evening or full
dress is, and always has been, de riyucur, dicoUeU.
It is the established Court dress of the English
Court, and there never has been a Sovereign so
strict in the rules and regulations which enforce
its observance as is the Queen herself. Her
Majesty in her best days was never alarmingly
reluctant as to the extent of her own display of
those womanly charms with the possession of
which she is in no small degree endowed. Her
daughters, too, when in evening dress, are quite
lavish in an exhibition which leaves but little to
the Imagination. Especially may this be said to be
the case with the Princess Louise.
People addicted to false teeth always say
they are more comfortable and vastly prelerable
to genuine teeth. This is also the lino of argu-
ment adopted by the woman with the glass eye,
and the man with the wooden leg. But that false
teeth are not perfectly comfortable la shown by
the fact that when a man wearing false teeth is
secure from observation be invariably takes out
his teeth, especially in hot weather. All wearers of
false teeth will be interested to learn that an
American lady, who has had an entire set of upper
false teeth, and who neither conceals the fact, nor
pretends that they ax-o preferable to real teeth,
now carries them suspended by a cord round her
neck, as it recently occurred to her that it would
be the part of common sense to use her teeth
only when she desired to talk or eat.
The unfair sex have always had men at
their mercy, but now that to their own craft and
wiles is added the genius of great inventors, we
don’t see any escape left, without stepping over
the edge of the world. The vague uncertainty as
to how much real woman, and how much art, he is
courting has always been a hau iting trouble on
the mind of the youthful lover, who is judiciously
kept at a distance. But even this precaution will
now be needless. His heart’s idol may even per-
mit her suitor to gratify his curiosity by a little
discreet fondling, and still not give herself away
enough to destroy his innocent ardour. What we
mean is simply this: A firm of rubber manufac-
turers in Paris advertise what they describe as
their “patent balloon contours, by which the
bosom of beauty can be made lifelike, both to
sight and touch.” The advertisement is not quite
clear. If the girl is satisfied that her patent ar-
rangement is life-like to look at, we don’t see
what she wan's to touch it for.
In Heath’s “ Book of Beauty ” it is re-
corded that the famous Countess of Coventry (one
of the “ Beautiful Gunnings ”) had to be protected
in her walks by constables, so Infatuated were the
people with her beauty in 1750. When Mathews
first took his wife to America, in 1838, she was
mobbed every time she appeared in the streets.
She was the famous Madame Vestrls, famous as
having possessed the most perfect foot (and handle
to it) of any woman of her day. And now, in 1884,
Mrs. Langtry is crowded upon at every place, till
she can hardly venture out on foot. In
the most fashionable watering place of Cali-
fornia, Monterey, where all the aristocracy
herds to its exclusive self, a “well-connected’’
dude spied the Lily the first Sunday she ap-
peared. Bursting with the Importance of his
knowledge, he and his companions gave chase,
and In a few moments Mrs. Langtry was sur-
rounded by hundreds of leering youths in galley-
pot collars and toothpick shoes. When, to escape,
she even took a short cut across some flower-beds,
they followed her, and eventually she had to take
a seat, and hide her face with her parasol, while
her maid returned to the hotel and procured an
escort and a vehicle. Then the mob of aristocratic
cads slunk away, and said “she wasn't much.”
Mr. Sarony, the famous New York photo-
grapher, has been giving his experiences or actors
and actresses before the camera. The ordinary
actress, he says, is the worst nuisance. She is never
satisfied, and always has ideas of her o > n which
are as a rule detestably inartistic. “Of all my
sitters, Bernhardt was the best. She was terrible
in one way. Always late for her appointments.
She would rush in three hours after time, but
apologise in such a pretty way that i had to for-
give her. Then she not only knew how to pose,
but when I got excited she felt the reflex of my
emotion, and so would gradually assume the ex-
pression I desired, and a grand picture was the
result.” Mr. Irving was too busy to sit, much to
the gushing photographer’s sorrow. “ Suppose we
had such heads of Talma. Kean, Garrick in cha-
racter! What a study they would be! As it is, we
have indifferent engx-avings from Indifferent paint-
ings. Booth has not cared to sit much. He seems
bored always when the theatre is mentioned, and
does not care to be photographed at all.” Miss
Terry’s tantalizing ways tried the ecstatic Mr.
Barony’s patience sadly. “Sh« is simply the best
subject I have ever had, but the most tantalizing.
I was in despair when she was in my studio; every
movement was a revelation of grace, every gesture
a picture, and every expression a delight. I was
crazy with pleasure. ‘ There, there—do, for Hea-
ven’s sake, stay in that position for three seconds,’
I would cry, but the next instant she had moved,
and some other lovely pose was the result. Her
walk across the room was a succession of pictures,
but no sooner did 1 implore her to remain for one
moment in any of the positions sha assumed than
it was gone.”
The host of lady litigants who are posing
as lawyers in the conduct of their own cases
before the English courts, are “amoosin’ little
cusses.” For Instance, when in the Court of Ap-
peal the other day, that great lawyer the Master
of the Rolls said to Mrs. Weidon, “The point of
law as to your right to sue upon the contract is
against you,” Mrs. W., with the air of a very
learned counsel, indeed, gravely replied. “ I think
so, too, my lord.” Whereupon Sir Balliol Brett
continued, “ Well, we think so, and you think so.”
Then there is the Dowager Countess de la Torre,
who is engaged in the benevolent task of rescuing
from a life of hardship all the houseless cats that
she can discover, and who does not confine herself
to those forsaken cats who have actually solicited
her attention to their wants. Seventy-seven for-
lorn grimalkins has the Countess placed in the way
of earning an honest living in the course of nine
months, aud It would seem that in her own house
she has a sort of crSche for kittens where their
mothers can leave them on bamboo chairs while
the benevolent founder of the institution is using
her influences on behalf of her charges. This lady
has been very successful In introducing to the
world several highly cultivated cats, who
have taken prizes in competitive examinations;
and yet, despite her good works, she appeared in
Court with a big lump of brief paper in her la
Txsseur-llke digits, to appeal against a magisterial
order, whereby she was ordered to discontinue
keeping 33 cats and dogs and other animals. An
inspector stated that he had visited appellant’s
house, but before getting there he noticed a most
abominable stench. In the front kitchen were
three puppies, in the back kitchen six cats, on the
first floor 11 cats, some of them ophthalmic, one or
two on the stairs, and some fowls in a room at the
top of the house. The Countess said, in Court,
that “ her husband was a Minister at Rome.” She
was a great student of natural history, and could
pass an examination as a doctor, but her father
was opposed to it. She had taken an interest in
cats all her life from feelings of humanity, and
because she was writing a book on natural history.
Her cats were always a subject of Uevylng black-
mail by her landlords. Her object was to find
homes for cats. She had several very valuable
cats worth £100 each, and had taken several prizes.
She had two Manx cats which were considered
perfect. Her appeal, we are sorry to state, was
dismissed with costs. Queer extremes meet in
lovely woman. A lady, charged with assaulting
her husband, had, it seemed, knocked about half
his teeth down his throat with a broom-handle,
which broke with the force of the blow. Yet,
when ordered to find a peace surety, she “was
carried out of Court in a faint.” The husband
said it was “all through his mothor-in-law.”

SOCIAL
It was sultry at the sports on Saturday
afternoon, and the large crowd preferred loung-
ing In the stand till a laie hour, before the general
parade began. Then, a good show of fashion was
seen, and Spring toilets were plentiful. Indeed,
the amount of spring in some ot them was remark-
able. It would be impossible to describe all the
new materials which are daily making their ap-
pearance for Summer wear. Their variety is infi-
nite, and their charm indescribable. But still,
pure white heads the list of toilets; for, when
made with skill and worn with grace, there is
something essentially womanly in a pure white
dress. Two were conspicuous on Saturday.
That worn by a tall young lady who shines
in many a ball-room, was beautifully made,
with large pouf, and worn with small straw
bonnet and light yellow gauntlet gloves—a white
parasol to match was just the touch of taste that
made the whole toilet perfect. The wearer of the
other was an exceedingly handsome girl of Devon-
shlre-stroet, whose gloves were bright yellow, and
sunflowers were set on the brim of her Henri
Deux. One of the new fabrics, like broche nun s
veiling, of deep cream colour, made a dress that
was much admired. It was distinguished by the
bold freedom of outline now so fashionable, and
clasped at the waist with a black velvet Swiss belt.
The cuff facings, collar, and gloves wore also
black, and the whole arrangement tasteful and
effective. A tall young lady with an enviable com-
plexion wore a cream nun’s veiling, so crisp and
clean-looking, and generally pretty, that everyone
admired it. A tall young lady from Randwick
wore a pretty new costume; it was of fungus-
brown cashmere, with satin trimmings of cedar
colour, a handsome hat, elaborately trimmed, and
the gloves corresponded. A light heliotrope, fall-
ing in plain folds, with mauve zone and ribbons,
and a large sheltering hat, made a young lady look
cool and comfortable in such weather. And,
while on hats, one girl wore such an immense
article, lined with black velvet, that, if a strong
wind had started, she would certainly have had to
get a couple of other girls to help her home. No
single girl could ever have carried that hat in a
gale of wind. It was like “Hanlanshat” in the
George-street window. The daughter of a large
builder in Elizabeth-street wore a rich costume of
green check silk, with peacock-blue vest front
and skirt panel; a fair Paddington pianiste wore
a punch-blue cashmere, which suited her well;
two Surry Hills sisters were neat in white linen;
the wife of a Redmyre solicitor looked very charm-
ing in a black broche toilet; and the daughter of a
teetotal M.P., of Newtown, lively in a nice white
toilet copiously embroidered, with a yellow rose rt
the throat. There were num berless other costumes
interesting to look at: some good, some gaudy,
some models of unobtrusive neatness, but the
general air of taste that prevailed was very notice-
able, and most of the ladies could be best described
by the comprehensive (though not new) phrase
“ well-dressed.” Two sisters in black velvet looked
too warmly clothed for the close afternoon: but
their dresses were extremely pretty ones, and none
looked nicer. Two satins were prominent—one
a trained dress, was of the pallid hue peculiar to
the shrimp before he is boiled; and the other was
suggestive of the lurid colour supposed to prevail
in another and a warmer world. The playing of
the Naval Artillery Band in their bright new uni-
forms was pleasing, and several times they sang as
well as played. As for the racing, it was llrst-olass.
B. Lupton breasted the tape first no less than four
times in short races, and D. D. Middleton landed first
in the three long ones. When all was over, the
people poured out as usual into the midst of a
squadron of plunging cab-horses, and the arontle
drivers had their usual tun seeing how close they
could rush by timid people without actually run-
ning over them. The traffic arrangements at the
Association Ground are very creditable to the
transit authorities. Fortunately, there were no
trams. If there had been, the cabbies would have
been deprived of some of their fun.
• •
A good ball was held in the Masonic Hall,
Dubbo, on the 17th inst., in aid of the Convent
Building Fund. It was a success, being attended
by over sixty couples, and some pretty toilets
were worn. The most noticeable were two hand-
some trained white silks, worn by Mrs. Alexander,
from Warren, and Mrs. Philips, of Dubbo. Miss
Butler had a host of admirers, and looked superb
in a soft white robe, relieved with cardinal flowers.
Her sister, Mrs. Ryan, looked well in a trained
pink nun’s veiling. Mrs. Caro wore a handsome
dress of cardinal broche, draped with a very pretty
net. Miss Tibbets, in pink, was very much ad-
mired, as was also Mrs. G. H. Taylor, in black silk
trimmed with pink. Mrs. Leeds, from a station
below Dubbo, looked charming la white satin.
Mrs. GUI's dress of blue and pink suited her well;
and Miss Oljorman wore white and blue with good
effect. Dancing was kept up till half-past four,
and no doubt all the guests were thoroughly
satisfied.
■ • •
On Tuesday evening, 16th inst., Mr. and
Mrs. Alex. Dean, of Elizabeth-street, gave a dance
to their friends, at Nithadale. The rooms were
profusely decorated with flowers and flags, woven
into many beautiful mottoes and figures. There
were about 170 present, and the two sons of the
host acted very courteously and efficiently as
M.’s C. Amid a fine display of beauty and dress,
the daughters of the hostess looked charming; the
elder in white satin broche body, the younger in
ruby velvet body; both with skirts of nun’s veil-
ing. The honours of belle were pretty equally dis-
tributed between two points (Potts’ and Milson’s).
The dresses which looked the most handsome or
unique were—maize satin and spangles, from Wat-
son’s Bay; heliotrope satin and cashmere; black
surah, artistically trimmed; white satin body and
muslin skirt; black gauze, and white grenadine.
A favourite at Nithsdale looked jolly in white
surah and pearls; a light blue cashmere, trimmed
with white lace, suited the tall, graceful figure of
a belle from a Northern suburb. Two sisters from
St. Leonards looked sweetly pretty In white; and
two sisters from Potts’ Point, in light blue, danced
with consummate ease and grace. The party
broke up at about 3. All seemed to have tho-
roughly enjoyed themselves.
* ♦ ♦
A plain and fancy ball, in aid of the hos-
pital, was held in the Mechanics’ Institute, Ooona-
barabran, on the 15th inst., which will be a red-
letter day in the social calendar of that town.
The hospital is the doctor's big baby, and Dr.
Loughlan has been very energetic in working for
its welfare. The committee. Messrs. H. II. Smith,
R. A Hawley, and T. Guerin, also worked well,
with some of the fair sex, and the baby will pro-
bably benefit over forty pounds. The ball-room
was nicely decorated with pines, mottoes, &c., and
a refreshment-room was erected outside. As
it was not large enough to hold all at
once, the Coonabara “bran-mashers” natur-
ally fdt the deprivation of the ladies’ so-
ciety very keenly. The supper-room was
like a Garden of Eden with only Eves to
eat the fruit. A little flirting general ly takes place
at supper, and the local lovers pour sweet nothings
into the ears of the fair while they load sweet
somethings into her mouth; and it was disappoint-
ing to have the usual practice interfered with.
Besides, being kept at the same time from both
ladies and jam pastry was like being deprived of
all the sweet things at once. At 9 the music,
which was the woaaest part of the festivity, be-
gan; and soon after, the following fancy characters
couldjbeseen dodgingabout the floor:—Lord Dun-
dreary, a well got-up affair by S. F. Moore; Night,
a black dress with stars and wand, by Miss
Ewing, who was duplicated later on by Miss
M’Donald in a similar dress. But both had a
change, the former also appearing as Esmeralda,
and the latter as a Nurse of the Red Cross. The
sex is always changeable. Two Highland Lassies
were Misses M'Grcgor and Church ; Daughter
of the Regiment. Miss M. Loughlan; Bride, Mrs.
Hyeronimus, looking very attractive; North Star,
by Miss M'Hugh in blue satin; Morning, Miss
Martin; Mabel (from “Pirates”) Mrs.Nicholson,
looking charming; Swiss Peasant, by Mrs. Tom-
kinson, one of the best dancers in the room; Retka,
Miss C. E. Ewing; Cherry Ripe, Miss J. Ewing;
Huntress, Miss Maggie Dean; Housemaid, Miss
Grace Dean; Red Cross Nurse, Miss Montgomery.
A pretty semi-blonde, from Baradine, looked
cnarming in white satin, with mauve bodice and
trimmings. Two married ladies from Cassilis-
street were prominent, one in old gold satin, with
black satin beaded underskirt, the other in cream
and cardinal. Dr. Loughlan was Hamlet; and Mr.
J. Dean was Count Delamere, in a good outfit.
Tago was Mr. C. E. Nicholson, and some thought
his the dress of the night. Claude Duval (J. Night,
jun.), Claude Melnotte (H. H. Smith), Italian Bri-
gand (W. Field), and Pirate King (8. Sowden) were
among the others, but most of them sadly wanted
substance in the calves. Sir Joseph Porter was
Mr. J. Pinoham; a Neapolitan Fisherman, Mr. w.
Blackman; and Sir Peter Teazle, Mr. G. Tomkin-
son, a very handsome dress. A Cavalier was Mr.
G. Neate; Officer Mr. R. A. Hawley; Robin Hood,
Mr. A. Dean: Tim Flaherty, Mr. If. Keney. It
was well on towards daylight when the hospital
ball came to an end. There is some talk of a brass
band being started in Coonabarabran.
* * *
This Friday the anniversary ball of the
Railway Department takes place in the new
Masonic Hall. Castlereagh-street; and Messrs.
i*earce and Daly, the secretaries, are working it
up carefully so as to ensure a night’s enjoyment.
Either plain or fancy dress may be worn, and the
Young Australian band is engaged. Dancing at
half-past 8.

One of the finest balls Ballarat has seen
was given lately by the Freemasons to welcome
R.W.D.G.M., Sir W. J. Clarke, and his wife. Nearly
500 were present, and the decorations, floral de-
vices. regalia, and dresses, were all very fine. His
Excellency the Governor and Lady Loch were also
present, and a number of toasts were given at the
supper. An orchestra contained twenty-five picked
musicians. Mrs. Morrison, the Mayoress of Bal-
larat, wore one of the handsomest toilets —a lemon
satin dress, trimmed with lace and white-frosted
roses, diamond jewellery according with the dress.
Lady Loch’s costume was an unassuming black
broche and black lace flowers, silver jewellery.
Lady Clarke wore an elegant amber silk dress of
great beauty, clouded with tulle of the same hue,
and-set off with diamonds. |
* * •
Though the Londoners’ Club did not make
a pretentious start in Sydney, it has flourished; :
and it’s first annual ball—which occurred in West’s J
Rooms on Friday—may be taken as a presage of ;
many pleasant gatherings in future. Mr. T. A.
Smith was secretary and M.C., looking well after
his guests, and at 4 o’clock, when the ball ended,
he had the gratification of knowing it had been
quite a social success. About nine o’clock music
began, and the room was soon astir with lovely
ladies and Londoners floating round the floor.
They did not all float, some people’s well-meant,
e[forts are more like “working their passage’
that floating; and one gentleman’s ideas of the terp-
sicborean art were so extremely original that he
encircled his partner with his left arm. A few
young ladies and gentlemen wore fancy dresses,
more gaudy than extensive. There is one ad-
vantage in limited skirts; if the owner’s face is
not magnetically attractive, the spectator’s eye
may perhaps rest with interest elsewhere. There
were many nice evening dresses. A beautiful one
was of pink satin, and figured silk skirt, of a good
fit and stylish make. Equally nice was a white
satin dress with cherries on the corsage, and about; i
a dozen complete birds affixed on the lower skirt;
and perhaps the consciousness of this excellent
toilet accounted for the pleasant look its owner
wore with it. Mauve moire and tarletan composed
the dress of a bouncing, bunchy sort of girl;,
and two brunette cousins from Chippendale wore
very handsome toilettes; they were alike, sleeve-
less bodices and paniers of rich crimson figured,
silk, and underskirts of old gold satin, the smooth
surface relieved merely by a few plain tucks. TIhe
three daughters of the secretary looked charmin g,
the eldest wearing pink veiling prettily set off
with maidenhair fern and white flowers, and the
younger sisters pink and white, respectively.
Another trio of “pretties” came from North
Shore; one wore pink satin and white lace,
and another cream striped satin, with large
flowers on bust and skirt, and her hair very
elaborately arranged a la wild Zulu. Both these
young ladles were extremely fascinating. Num-
ber three, being much younger, cannot, of course,
expect to be as effective as her sisters just yet.
But she looked very promising in white. A mar-
ried lady from Woolloomooloo was remarked for
her fine statuesque figure, well set off by a sleeve-
less costume of black, with old gold satin skirt in
broad plaits. The chaste little programmes in
white and gold, contained twenty well-assorted
dances, and bore on them the arms of the city of
London, a plain shield bearing a broad cross, and
in one quartering the dagger that killed Wat
Tyler. Above, perched a sparrow, emblem of the
Club. Over 120 persons were present altogether,
for whom T. Cripps provided refreshments in an
upper room. It was a bother having to go up-
stairs every time, but the catering was well done.
Another disadvantage of the constant stair-climb-
ing was that the stairs are rather narrow and steep;
and as the present fashion in ladies' dress is so
very peculiar, bashful men had to look at their
boots all the time.
* * •
The quietness which usually reigns over
Murrumnurrah was enlivened on Friday, the 19th
instant, by a ball given by the ladies. The Assem-
bly Hal! was richly decorated for the occasion,
and, with the accessories of good supper and
excellent music from Goulburn, dancing was
thoroughly enjoyed by all present. The ladies
were indefatigable in their attentions to visitors,
and the success of the affair was due to their
exertions. Some pretty costumes were noticeable.
Cream and blue seemed the prevailing and
favoured shades, and a few black ones were worn.
The honour of behe was divided between a local
young lady in a cardinal satin sleeveless bodice
and cream veiling skirt relieved with knots of
cardinal, and a young lady from Binalong in pink
satin and cream lace. The programme of twenty-
five dances was not finished till the day began to
dawn.
♦ * *
On Friday, the 19th instant, Mrs. Barry
gave her second “At Home” at Blshopscourt.
Unlike Government Houe receptions, Mrs. Barry’s
were by special invitation only; am great was the
glee, and woeful the gloom, of those who were,
and those who were not, invited. From 3 o’clock
the road to Blshopscourt was quite gay with car-
riages ; amongst which were a few antedilu-
vian four-wheelers, looking more than usually
forlorn, and several smart hansoms, whose
drivers had a spry and self-satisfied air. In-
side the grounds all was animation. Tables
were spread under the verandah with snowy
cloths, upon which dark-blue old china tea-cups,
cakes, and flowers were set. The Bishop had been
early pressed .into the servicejand his manner of
waylaying the guests and landing them before
these well-spread tables, and then rushing off to
seize fresh arrivals, was another proof of the
earnest masterfulness of his character. There were
very tew of the male sex present, and those were
mostly clergymen and elderly men. There was
seen but one young one—a regular masher—and
one felt sorry for him, for he looked as though ho
were lost. He wandered about in the most lament-
able state, and once, when he thought himself
unobserved, he threw up his lavender-kidded
hands in a helpless way, and muttered, in a sort of
stave whisper, “ Where am I ?” Many would like
to know what has become of that young man. for
the settled gloom of his countenance was suicidal.
The ladies came out in great force, and some of
the costumes were beautiful. Mrs. Barry was in
black broche, with small black bonnet and
grey feathers. Miss Constable was entirely
in white—bonnet, veil, and gloves to match. Her
aunt, Mrs. Constable from Balmain, looked elegant
in dark brown plush with small cap-shaped bonnet
of real lace. The bride of a newly-appointed very
high official carried a parasol which attracted a
good deal of attention. It was composed of loops
of white satin ribbon over a foundation of net. in
the hand it looked uwkward and untidy, but when
open the effect w-as pretty. There were several
light Summer costumes, which a month hence
would be charmir.g, but were too unseasonable tor
last Friday afternoon. The Bishop, with Mrs.
Barry and Miss Constable, will visit Bathurst this
! week, and be abs ent for about ten days.

The Oxford, and Cambridge dinner oc-
curred at Baumann’s caf<5 on Monday night. Some
sixty gentlemen, whose educational career had
been under tb.e auspices of the dark or light blue
respectively, (jat down to a most elaborate repast.
The Primate, Bishop Barry, was present, and the
company wsa mostly of the learned professions.
Besides the formal toasts, the only one was that
of “The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge,

Wedmisday last week, an enjoyable even-
ing was 8’ pent at the Mechanics’ Institute, Narrabri.
it being txr.e annua 1 ball of the Oddfellows. Special
attention , was paid to a line supper, and the dancing
was very hearty. Belleship was disputed, so many
having claims; but most favoured a young lady
from M' tibourne, in cream nun’s veiling, lace, and
pearls. A maiden in black satin, trimmed with
pink In ads and pearl ornaments, had many ad-
mirers:, while an amber satin bodice, with satin
and ta jrietan skirt, was really pretty. Near day-
break the cotnpany separated.

* Iki- BQuesquirioulum to see what sort of
tumbling they are doing there.
* * ♦
As we draw near the doorof the“markee,”
Mr. Woodyear meets us with a smile that is evi-
dently the reflection of the gold he is compelled to
count after each performance, and conducts us to
his private box. Then Madame comes and sits
beside us, and tells us all about the actors, the
trick ponies, the monkey, and the trained dogs.
Presently she whispers something in Mr. Wood-
year s ear, ;and we are quite unaccountably in-
vited to step out into Itbe office. We go like a
Iamb to the slaughter, for the pretty, graceful, and
wa ilP r0 5 ( L r *' 10ned Ruby Scarsdale is right in the
middle of her clever trapeze act, and is throwing
kisses that only miss Madame Woodyear’s ear and
catch us just under the nose every quarter of a
minute. We Imagine, of course, that Woodyear
wants to show us his receipts for the evening, and
beguile us into making a par. about “the wonder-
ful and unparalleled success,” &c. &c. But, no; it
is not gold coin that the showman wants to show
Us. It is gold top,” if you please; and we look
at it so much through the bottom of a very thin
tour-ounce glass, that when we go back to our seat
the whole circus is turning around like a whirly-
gig with a boy on each end. We saw
one Myra Kemble sitting in the dress-circle before
we went out, but aftei wards there were two, and
each was trying how much prettier she could look
than the; other. We knew that this was merely
a trick of distorted vision, and we shut one
em and behold, there was only one face
where we had seen two. Just at this point,
Madame Woodyear laughs over one of our
last week s jokes that she has only begun to
see through, and Myra turns to see what all the
run s about. No sooner does her eyes rest on us
than a scowl comes over her pretty face that we
wouidn t have brought there for the world. We
weren t winking at her, of course, but she turned
on us so quickly that we couldn’t get that other
eye open in time to save our neck. From this date
forward we reckon our reputation for courtesy
and proper deportment in that quarter will
be at a discount of about 400 per cent. And, by
the way, if you haven’t seen her lately, you
■would hardly believe how fresh and bright Miss
Kemble is looking just
now. We are informed
that she is coming back
to the stage ene of these
days; and, if she plays as
well as she looks, we’re
going to say something
pretty about her, if we
have to lay awake three
nights in succession to
think it up.
* * *
But we haven’t told
you much about the
circus, have we? We
know you don’t care for
that, however, for you
have long believed that
“circuses are all alike,”
and differ only in degrees
of excellence. We have
seen better circuses than
Woody ear's, and a multi-
tude of worse ones. In
some things the Elec-
tric Circus excels. Cooma
Kitehi and his perform-
ance on the swinging-bar,
for instance, is probably
the only performance of
its kind in the world; and
it is a most Interesting
novelty. Then the jug-
gling on horseback of
Lerarti Lee has never
been surpassed, if, possi-
bly, equalled anywhere.
The two Japanese,Cooma
Kitchl and Itohie some-
body (Madame Woodyear
calls him “ Itchie Scrat-
chy,” to save trouble)
are wonderfully clever in
everything they under-
take. Cooma does some
ground-tumbling feats
that nobody else ever
tried and got well again.
Of course you know that
Donald Dinnie, the cele-
brated Scotch athlete, is
with the Circus this
week, and is exhibiting
himself in wrestling and
feats of strength. Pro-
fessor Sylvester's trained
dogs aren’t “ up to
much,” and the trained
ponies will be worth
something after they’ve
had a little more intelli-
gent training. But now
we must leave the Circus,
for there’s other shows
on this week, and you’ll
want to hear sometmg of
the rest.
“Fret you the ventages thus, and it will
discourse most excellent music," exclaimed Ham-
let, who lived at a period when the flute, or “ pipe”
as he called it, must have been in a very embryotic
state of development, judging from the instru-
ment exhibited last Monday night by Mr. Radcliff,
as the Identical one which the melancholy young
Danish party used to enforce; some rather caustic
remarks made to his would-be father-in-law, who,
it would appear, had mistaken him for a wind in-
strument-misled, no doubt, by his proneness to
make long-winded soliloquies. “ You can't play
upon this pipe, governor, simple as it is; and you
can’t play your games upon me—I am too fly for
you, you seel” Hadcliff, however, could and did
play upon this identical pipe; and there is not the
slightest doubt but he could, with equal ease,
have twisted Hamlet round his Unger, and have
doubled him up in one round—or. perhaps, as
one may more aptly say, at one blow. We
were not aware that “ We won't go home till
morning” was a popular air among the earlier
Danes—although (it never struck us before this
instant) the Ghost may have varied his usual as-
surance to Hamlet to the effect that he (the Ghost)
must tear himself away when the cocks began to
crow, by quoting the first and only line of that
somewhat hackneyed poem. At any rate, “ We
won’t go home till morning ” seemed to be the
only tune within tho compass of the Hamletian
pipe, and Radcliff played it with such pathos that
something or other rose up in our critic's throat;
it may have been emotion—it may have been only
tho remains of a cigar, which he came into the
hall absent-mindedly smoking, and suddenly re-
collecting the place and the occasion, had no other
alternative but to swallow and get rid of it.

Passing briefly on to the numerous assort-
ment of pawn-broker’s goods which lay upon a
table, from a stuffed pig to a section of gas-pipe,
ail of which in due rotation, were described and
played upon by the greatest living blower (not
even excepting Henniker Heaton), who demon-
strated, to the satisfaction of every one present,
that, with a little practice, one can laarn to blow
upon a musical instrument and talk very learnedly
and entertainingly in the same breath. We come
to that part of the entertainment which pleased
us most. It is that in which the great flautist
gave his wife a chance to say a word. And she
said her say, in spite of the fact that he kept blow-
ing on his soraething-or-other-keyed flute the
whole time with an expresei m of countenance
that reminded one of a small boy sucking a piece
ol sugar-ca”o-utterly regardless of the fact that
she was mistaking his performance for the singing
a lark, and was teilin# him so in the most
J?woo! 0l mu m ?' I1I l e . r imaginable. And what a lark
1 u Was • i e 18 » the lark and the voice grot so
mixe <* UP, that you couldn’t tell, for
the life of you, which was the lark and which was
the voice, and you didn’t care. Our critic was so
carried away that he fell to writing incoherent
epigrams upon the lining of his hat—a fact which
speaks volumes for the bewitching nature of the
performance. We append one or two of the least
maudlin. By the way, if you pronounce Rita as
you write it, you won’t be right: —

which is undoubtedly the fossil remains of a tear.
—Ed. B. I By a superhuman effort, our critic mas-
tered his emotions and attempted to speak of the
performance by the cold light of calm criticism. It
was of no use ; for, barring Mr. Radcliff’s in-
structive and satisfactory remarks upon the his-
tory of the various crude forms out of which the
perfect instrument of to-day has been evolved, the
performance dulls the nib point of the critical
goose-quill, and taking the emotions captive, in-
sists upon being recognised as the most perfect of
the kind ever enjoyed in Sydney.

Charles and the divine Annis, the company com-
prises a good working team-an experienced body

open at Bathurst, squeeze orange idry, and pro-
ceed. Caron conducts the orchestra.
Picton opines that it would be just as sen-
sible to talk of a chimney-sweep competing with a
jeweller, as of a parson with Charles Bright. Well,
there s something in the idea, only we should have
hardly gone so far as to make a jeweller the
analogue of Bright. Chimney-sweep, however,
admirably suits the parson, black being the recog-
nised blazon of either. By the bye, this raises the
old question, why are churchmen black? Fon-
blanque once reasoned from the colour of a black
teapot to that of a bishop, and found that just as
the one did not make good tea because, instead of
retaining its heat for what is put into it, it parts
with it outwards, so does the cleric—instead of re-
taining his warmth for the charity and holiness
with which he is supposed to be charged, he
throws out the heat on external objects, and so
loses the internal temperature necessary to extract
the virtue of good-will to men with the le-sons of
which they are stored. An Anglican clergyman
(such as he who insinuated that the Secularists’
weapons were abuse, ribaldry, lecherous talk,
filthy Innuendo, andjfalsohood shouted from plat-
forms with an eye to selflsh and unlawful gain),
with the leavea of Scripture in him inculcating
charity, heating all around him with orthodox
wrath against views that don’t coincide with his
own dogmas, while his human charity gets cold
in the same proportion, is like the black teapot
radiating out the heat which it should keep within
to draw the goodness from its contents, and thus
failing to perform its functions.
As resonant a logomachy as one might
choose to assist at has arisen out of those lectures
which Bishop Moorhouse has been giving in 8t.
Paul’s Pro-Cathedral in Melbourne. The subject
is a serious and solemn one, and we let it stand
aside while noting the lines to which the theologi-
cal belligerants commit themselves. First, the
Bishop spreads himself suorrwre, and gyrates about
the central dogma of Christianity so as to earn the
encomiums of a large class of people. 1 he great
majority of this class, It may be well to point out,
cannot, for the life of them, tell, five minutes after
the Bishop has finished, what precisely his verbal
polka signifies. Their little craze is to be esteemed
wide-minded, broad-hearted men, whose religion
is a respectable profession, and does not involve
any extreme views. They distrust extreme views,
and the Bishop’s style of reasoning makes it ap-
pear that the Founder of Christianity was a per-
sonage of whom the people of Melbourne may wall
feel proud. And there is something about the
episcopal tone that implies that that is no small
compliment to the Founder of Christianity. Well, a
lately-arrived Hebrew gets into the ring just about
here. He wants it to be understood that the Jews
of old knew what they were up to, and were well
able to assess the character of the new Reformer;
and that actually the sort of respectability the
Bishop claims for bis Master existed in the Jewish
Church since the early days. The trend of the
Hebrew’s argument is that, in as far as the Bishop
succeeded in making the Founder of the Christian
religion respectable, or like the good people of
modern Melbourne, he made Him a gentlemanly
Jew. Thereupon Father Slattery unsheathed his
free and flashing sword, and vaulted over the rope.
Father Slattery argues the question as a church-
man amo n g ciurchmeu. but does not deeply inter-
be la ys the Bishop across his knees and
8 a U vP* K C^8 llrr *, the battery of slaps which the
Ang-lican mother church should have Ion# aero ad-
ministered. He cites the oaths Dr. Mooimouse
subscribed at his consecration, and implies that
were Anglicanism wrapped around as solid a back-
bone of conviction as Presbyterianism, there
would be another little schism like the Charles
Strong one, and a Bishop would be getting a purse
ol sovereigns and making tracks homeward on
account of the splendid fashion in which he had
persistently ignored what he swore solemnly to
maintain. As it stands, however, it is a flue logo-
machy. °
Though London policemen are constantly
being shot by burglars, the authorities don’t like
™ a rm them with revolvers. It is proposed to
provide Policeman X with and train him in the
use of the lasso! And as it is also suggested that a
®P®' C1 ?J “ r f ier ,o f merit for valorous policemen
should be instituted, and that on special occasions
Her Majesty should pin the medal to Robert’s

It was not expected that any definite ar-
rangement would be entered into at the meeting
of scullers held at the Oxford Hotel on Monday
night, so that a general fixing up came rather as a
pleasurable surprise. Various were the sugges-
tions made by those concerned, and still more
numerous were suggestions from those who know
not one end of a boat from the other, but who
have bobbed up serenely
during the discussions
on this! momentous na-
tional affair, as the Jaynii
puts it. After a couple of
hours’ “ barney,” things
looked so unsettled that
Beach, who was booked
for Dapto that night,
picked up his “ masher”
and made a start for
home, but was called
back, and in a few
minutes the whole affair
was clinched, agreements
signed, and deposits put
down for the following
matches: Hanlan and
Beach on 28th March,
and Hanlan and Clifford
on 18th April; but the
latter event only on the
understanding that Clif-
ford beats Beach in their
match on the 28th Feb-
ruary. Hanlan wanted,
right or wrong, to pull
the winner of the Beach-
Cliff ord match ; but the
Clifford party would not
do that, and insisted on
a proviso that a match
should first be made
with Beach, win or lose.
Then tides cropped up,
each side being as well
posted as a nautical al-
manac ; and when some
Goth in the room pro-
posed the date should
be fixed by the spinning
of a coin, the worthy
chairman, Mr, M’Cartuy,
of that ilk, was scanda-
lised to think such a
national affair should be
settled by the tossing of
a grey, and that the
rulers of the respective
destinies of Canada and
Australia should descend
to the level of a “gaff-
ing” school. However,
all’s well that ends well,
and such was tho state
of affairs when Beach
slipped off to catch the
eleven o’clock steamer,
bound for Dapto, tho
historic spot where tho
Champion of the Uni-
verse dreamed away his
early years, toying list-
lessly with a 141b. sledge
hammer. The Beach-
Hanlan-Clifford matches
now stand:—Hanlan ar d
Clifford on February 7th;

and Hanlan on March 38th; and Clifford and

Next to real victory itself, the best thing
out is a good retreat. The truth of this was evi-
dently well understood by a recent candidate for
aldermanlc honours out West, who, on being
beaten by 37 votes, thanked the ratepayers heartily
for the '‘unbounded confidence which they had
almost placed in him.” For a six-feet, double-
edged. barbed, and poisoned Parthian dart, how-
ever, it would be hard to beat the retort courteous
of a defeated London candidate, who, being asked
how he felt after his drubbing, replied, “ Well, I
suppose I feel pretty much the same as Lazarus
did.” “As Lazarus did!” exclaimed the other;
“ how was that “ Why,” returned the rejected,
“ Lazarus was licked by dogs, and so was I. This
looks as if our M'Elhone was beginning to make
his influence felt at home already.
Ehen! Is life worth living ? We are rather
inclined to think it is not, for, having consulted
Dr. Drounbrowskl as to the best means of staving
off any attacks of the 300 per diem Naples cholera,
he drives us to the brink of despair by replying
nothing can save us unless we attend to the fol-
lowing painful regime. Voila!— “Live well—that
is to say, on cutlets, turtle soup, poultry, game, or
whatever you fancy, provided it is not unripe
fruit. Drink the best claret, champagne, dry
shen y, and old cognac that can be procured—in
fact, ‘keep yourself up.’ Avoid worry of every
description. Do not worry yourself or let others
worry you. Point out to you>- wife and children
the absolut; necessity of protecting the ‘ bread-
winner ’ from annoyance—unless the family is pre-
pared to lose its head. Indulge yourself in amuse-
ments so long as they do not fatigue you. Allow
yourself ‘horse exercise,’ but be careful not to
overdo it. Walk in moderation, and always take
a hansom when you feel anything approaching
weariness. Early hours are desirable so far as
going to bed is concerned; but early rising is not
to be recommended, inasmuch as it induces
fatigue. Avoid, as far as possible, political and
other discussions. Leave public questions alone,
and take no part in conversations of a controver-
sial character. Read only literature. Smoke, ac-
cording to inclination, so long as the epidemic
lasts; but only cigarettes or cigars of the best
quality. By regulating yourj habits according to
these simple directions, you will And a great im-
provement in your health, and be, at all events, in
a better condition to resist cholera if It attacks
you.” All we want is 77 years of the above, and
then bring on your champion cholera.
Political Points
From the third annual report of the Land
Nationalisation Society of London wo learn that
“ two members of the society desire to have some
land that they hold devoted to promote the reali-
sation of the Land Nationalisation principle. One
of these members has bequeathed a freehold in-
terest to the society; and the fact is happily re-
corded that these, the first offerings of the kind to
the society, are both from members of the medical
profession.”
A lot of fat sinecures are, thanks to the
Radical party, being wiped out in England. Not
so very long ago a Duchess of Manchester got
£2938 annually from the tax-payers as titular
“sweeper of the Mall;” another lady of title was
“chief usher in the Court of Exchequer.” The
Beresford family held the posts of “ wine-tasters,
storekeepers, packers, and craners ” in Ireland. In
every conceivable manner the English nobility
fastened themselves on the pockets of the people.
How else could a large and luxurious nobility be
maintained ? Charles II. created fifteen dukes, six
of them his own illegitimate offspring, and throe
of his mistresses countesses. These the profligate
monarch, whose exchequer was always at low
tide, provided for out ol the public purse. Their
descendants, the Dukes of Richmond, 8t. Albans,
and Grafton, are still burdens upon the people’s
pockets in this way.
In N.Z., the short-lived Stout-Vogel Cabi-
net known as the Comet Ministry was succeeded
by an Atkinson-Wakefleld combination, which,
however, was only sworn in, to be immediately
kicked out by the House. This Ministry got the
nickname of the “ Dog Tail Ministry,” in this
way. In his speech in the “ no confidence ” debate,
Mr. Wakefield argued that the new combination
was a different article altogether from the “ Con-
tinuous Atkinson Ministry,” and its policy in the
future would be quite different from that of the
late Ministry-and for a better as a matter of
course. Sir Julius Vogel replied that the argu-
ment suggested the old conundrum of whether
the dog wagged the tail or the tail the dog. In
this case there would be no dlfliculy in deciding
which was the dog and which the tall, and he
thought the tall would have to follow the dog and
get wagged in the old way. The debate resulted
in a second Stout-Vogel Government being formed,
which is now likely to continue in power for the
session and ensuing year.
The other day the London Times said, in
regard to the rejection of the Franchise Bill, that
“ the Conservatives would now be confronted
with the primordial forces of society.” In reply
to a convenient correspondent, who wants an ex-
Elanation of the phrase, the 8t. Jambs Gazette, a
igh-toned Tory organ, says:—“By ‘the primor-
dial forces of society ’ the instincts of barbarism
are meant. It is to restrain the primordial forces
of society that policemen, magistrates, and gaolers
are maintained. The persons who shot the two
constables at Hoxton were moved to do so by the
?rlmordial forces of society. In our days these
oroes are most conspicuously seen at work in
brigandage; but the primordial forces with which
the editor of the Times threatens us will probably
go no further than window-smashing at first, and
ouse-breaklng and house-burning later on.’
This is the kind of thing the Arods used to write
about Berry when he started to tax the Victorian
squatters, and root out the lazy holders of fat sine-
cures. But the Argus got whipped and so will
the Tories.
The possibility of a combination between
France and Germany has long been considered by
the Russians. “The magnificent harbour at Wil-
llamshaven (Yahde), constructed by Prussia in the
territory of Oldenburgh, has for many years been
pointed out in warning as directed against Great
Britain. It is remarkable that, though Ports-
mouth and Dover are fortified against the French,
no fortifications protect the Essex coast against
the Prussians; yet the English autumn manoeu-
vres are always directed against an Invasion from
the Channel, never against one from the Bast
Coast, marching to surprise London, which, in the
month of August, when the Government and the
people are all engaged in holiday-making, might
be both a speedy and an easy task.” England had
better keep her eye on the “ Yarmans.” It should
never be forgotten that when old Blucher
visited London, after Waterloo, he exclaimed,
"Mein OottI Vat a place to saokl” And
we find that Germany, where there is now
much bitterness against England owing to the
undoubted jealousy manifested by the British
Foreign Office in regard to the proposed German
colonies, is evidently very much in earnest in her
efforts to become a first-class naval Power. The
projected ship canal across Holstein, large enough
to allow monster Ironclads to steam through direct
from the Baltic to the German Ocean, is at last to
be commenced in earnest. The canal will blot out
unfortunate Denmark from the map of Europe.
Instead of commanding the Baltic entrance she
will dwindle down to an unimportant peninsula
with paltry maritime interests. In maritime war-
fare the sole possession of this short cut to the
Baltic will almost seem to give the German fleet
the property of Sir Boyle Roche’s bird, to be in two
places at once. It has now just come to this—that
the great Teutonic people have got “cooky,” and
mean to master the world If they can. They have
now started to expel all foreign words from their
language—and, at the same time, to enrich their
melodious lingo by some of the clumsiest circum-
locutions that misapplied ingenuity has ever pro-
duced. In State documents “Ursohrift has dis-
possessed “ original,” and “pension ’ still later has
had to make room for “ ruhegehalt.”
Daly, the dynamitard, who at Warwick
(Eng), was recently sentenced to life imprison-
ment, tried to cast his last “ speech and confession”
in the Bmmetiau mould. He said, amongst other
things, that " he would far rather walk into a dun-
geon than forsake the opinions he held of his
country and abandon hope of their realisation. It
was, perhaps, unfortunate for him that he had not
followed the example of the wretches who put the
Crown in possession of information which might
drag other men into the same position in which he
himself thou was. Whilst he lay in his cell, his
mind and his soul would still bo his own property.
His life would be his own, and in the darkness of
the cell his mind would fly back to that country
for which ho had pleaded, and striven to teach the
people not to be assassins or cut-throats, but to
obtain their freedom as magnanimous and righte-
ous people, and to use their liberty as such in the
face of heaven and the world. His mind would
take him back also across the Atlantic, where it
would recall many fond recollections. They might
send him to prison, but they could not control
those sentiments. The past history of his country
was one terrible story of blood. Ever since the
English people had set foot on its soil it had simply
been one continuous battle of self-defence, or of
blood poured out to satisfy the machinations of
despotic rulers.” All this doesn’t, however, alter
the fact that it was truly or untruly alleged on
oath that bombs had been found in his possession.
Daly delivered himself of a bitterly contemptuous
tirade against the informer, “the animal Moran”
(the approver whose evidence was instrumental
in securing his conviction), which reminded
one a little of Curran’s celebrated invective:
“The stormy wave of the multitude recedes at
the informer’s approach, and the heart of man
bows down before him in the undisguised homage
of deferential horror.” Moran, said Daly, “ carried
his own hell about with him. and would continue
so to carry it until that inevitable day of doom,
when, to the undying fires of the larger hell within
his cankered bosom and his red-hot brain, there
were added those smaller eternal flames which had
been lighted during ten billion ages to satiate the
vengeance of an unsparing God.” Great precau-
tions were taken during the trial; the Court-house
was surrounded all the time by police and military
stationed at specially-erected barriers. It has since
transpired that a most dramatic and desperate
plot for the Instantaneous destruction of the
Court and all within its precincts had been formed
by the Invincibles. Their intention, happily frus-
trated, was that Daly should, in the dock, suddenly
lift up his voice and formally pass sentence of
death upon the judge, jury, prosecutors,, and wit-
nesses: and that, at the same moment, an Invin-
cible, who, disguised in barristerial wig and gown,
had, a few moments previously, entered Court
with a couple of law-books in one hand and a
baize book-bag full of panclastile bombs in the
other, should hurl them in the air and let them
fall, “mixing up.” as one of the brotherhood put
it, “ the Judge’s brains with Daly’s toes,”
Professor Thorold Rogers has, in the cur-
rent number of the Fortnightly Review, a
scorching article on the House of Peers. He re-
affirms tne resolution adopted by the Commons in
1649, “ that the House or Peers in Parliament is
useless, dangerous, and ought to bo abolished.”
Professor Rogers remarks that “ ever since the
Whig Peers resisted the occasional Conformity
Bill promoted by Nottingham, they have done
nothing but countenance all oppression and resist
all justice. They never raised their voices against
the atrocious Penal Codes of the Eighteenth Cen-
tury, though most of these bloody laws were
passed at the instance of the Whigs and the traders,
i:he latter of whom they cordially detested. . .
They have never resisted one foolish Act of the
Commons. The most cherished privilege of the
Peerage, their incontestable right to a writ of
summons, the heritable character of a writ of
summons, the incapacity to surrender a peerage,
are self-assertions, unwarranted by any positive
law. and contradicted by numerous precedents.
As to antiquity, there are not half a dozen peer-
ages, other than Baronies revived by the discretion
of the House, which date before the Reformation;
and everyone knows the history of the Reforma-
tion and the Stuart peerages. What has Lord
Salisbury, who'is leading the Lords against Mr.
Gladstone and the people, to say to the following:
“The most distinguished is that of the younger
branch of the House of Cecil, a family which
became opulent in the first place by the plunder
of the Church—a plunder which, when Burleigh
was gorged, he was Induced to stop. The first
noble of the younger stock was the adviser of
arbitrary taxation in the reign of James, and gave
the earliest occasion for the quarrel which led t®
the overthrow of the monarchy and the execution
of the King. His son became a Parliamentarian,
and, as far as a Peer could be, a Regicide, for he
sat In the Lords until the Commons extinguished It
on Feb. 6,1649. The fourth Earl became a Papist,
and was associated with the bigotry of James and
the crimes of Sunderland. Thenceforward the
family became obscure, was duly raised to the
Marquisate, and is now represented by the reputed
Leader of the Opposition, who has been educated
in the House of Commons and by the Saturday
Review, from the latter of which teachers he has
probably derived his incessant and startling in-
accuracy, his habitual recklessness, and his lofty
contempt for anybody but himself." Of His Grace
the Duke of Argyll, Mr. Rogers writes " The
Duke is a very able man, very lucid in speech and
writing, very eloquent, didactic, convinced, and
forcible. But I never heard of any human being,
or any human opinion, with which the Duke was
ever in sympathy. A nation may be diiven by
oppression into passive rebellion, or open acts of
outrage; but the Duk» has no regard for anybody
but the oppressors, if they belong to his own
order, and to interests analogous to his. The
wrongs of the Irish peasant, the distress of the
Scotch crofter, the despairing discontent of the
British farmer, are met by him with an insistence
on the sacred rights of one kind of property.
Even when he undertook to expose the economic
fallacies of Mr. Henry George, he could not re-
frain from insulting him. I do not wonder at this.
It is the insita superba of a nobleman who instinc-
tively concludes that anyone who criticises him
or his order must be in the wrong.” And as to the
demand of the so-called “ Lords ” to a plebiscite or
general election“ The demand is supremely
ridiculous. It is to the effect that the majority of
500 persons, casual beyond description, and incom-
petent to judge beyond parallel, should arrest all
legislation, remit the representatives of the people
to the people, and exorcise the prerogative which
Charles I. exercised till the nation was provoked
into the Long Parliament.”
In the words of an eminent English writer,
the men who rule Ireland from Dublin Castle are
“ a flock of black sheep—a more foul and scabby
sot of sheep never exercised sway in any land.”
Mr. Bolton, the Crown solicitor, is but a brown
sheep compared with the dingy hue of French,
Cornwall, and others. Yet, in 1876, an English
Judge regretted that he could not strike the name
of this solicitor off the rolls, and the worthy
man, instead of being struck off the rolls,
was retained in office. Bolton, who is on the same
side of polities as Cornwall and French, who,
thanks to the boldness of Mr. O’Brien, M.P., editor
of United Ireland, and the skill and pertinacity
of Meiklejohn (the same well-known individual
who, some years ago, was sent to gaol with Detec-
tive-Inspector Druscovltch and Mr. Froggatt, the
solicitor), now stand committed for trial for the
most odious of crimes, brought a libel action
against United Ireland, which, he alleged, had
hinted that he was mixed up in the horrible “ Dub-
lin scandal.” When the case came to trial before a
“property-picked” Jury “of the right sort’ in
the Orange town of Belfast, Bolton at first refused
to go Into the witness-box—thereby emulating the
example of a certain other gentleman who on a
recent occasion prudently adopted a similar line of
procedure, despite the fact that he had sworn,
when resisting defendant’s application for a change
of venue to Dublin, that he (Bolton) was a neces-
sary witness in the case! It came out that Bolton
owed £90,000 and received £3000 salary, of which he
annually allowed his creditors £300. He had been
allowed by the venality of the Dublin authorities
to retain his position, out of which he should have
been long ago kicked for bankruptcy, if for no
other reason. It has also transpired that French,
who had to leave the police service on account of
the infamous acts attributed to him, had actually
been given a pension by the very men who profess
to rule Ireland with justice ! 1 When Bolton, after
being fairly hooted into the witness-box by the
remarks of members in the Commons, was ex-
amined and cross-examined, things went along
in this wise:—“Mr. Monroe: You heard the state-
ment made by Dr. Boyd yesterday that you had
broken open the box containing your wife’s se-
curities, and stolen them?—Yes. Is there the
slightest truth in that statement?—Not the
slightest. Dr. Boyd : The act speaks for itself.
Cross-examined by Dr. Boyd,—Did you swear this
same story when the proceedings were brought in
England?—I did. Did Mrs. Bolton deny every
word of it?—Yes: she took a different view. Do
you know what age Mrs. Bolton was when she
died ?-I do not; she was about twenty years older
than myself. Might I ask Mr. Bolton, if It is not a
too impertinent question, what age you are ?—I
was born in 1818. Then Mrs. Bolton must have
been born in 1798; tell me would you have married
her only for her £80,000? - Witness hesitated' for
some time.—Dr. Boyd ; Come sir, answer the ques-
tion ; was it her money you married ?-Witness
(slowly) : Well, it was a strong inducement
(laughter).—Mr. Munroe: Truly that is a legal an-
swer (laughter).—Dr. Boyd (to witness): You would
nothave married herunless you gotafirstlife inter-
est in her money?—I would.—With remainder to any
children of the marriage?—That was mere matter
of form. Tell me, were you humbugging this
woman who was born in 1798?—I was not. The
witness was then cross-examined as to the pro-
ceedings before the English Court of Chancery,
«nd denied the allegation that he had broken open
the tin box containing the securities. It was not a
fact that Mrs. Bolton refused to give up the key of
the box. Did you break open this box as a matter
of fact ?—I got it opened by an ironmonger in
Dublin. Did you ever get a key for the box?—
Never. I took possession of the policy for insur-
ance, but gave it up to the trustees in 1879. Had
you any illicit connection with Ann Every during
your wife’s lifetime?—Yes, she had a child, and!
Said affiliation money for a short time. Who is
[rs. Smith, Abbey-road, Kllburn, London ?—The
same woman. The age of Every at the time of
the seduction was twenty years. Witness paid her
money from time to time.” In addressing the jury
for the defence, Dr. Boyd remarked that it was
pleasant to find a man of Bolton’s repute come
Into Court and call God to witness that there was,
at all events, one crime of which he had not been
guilty. Of course, the Belfast Jury found a big
verdict for Bolton; damages, £3050.

correspondent there informs us, at the idea of

An Evangelical says that the reason the
High Church people burn so many candles is that
they are in the dark.
There was frenzied fright in his bursting
eyes, trembling fear on his quivering lips, stray
straws in his scorched-banana hair, and the aroma
of rum and onions in his kill-at-500-yards breath,
as the editor of a Northern journal clutched a
mimbir av th’ local foorce, and gasped out, “ 8ar-
jint, foiler me; there’sh thievesaroun’, an’murder
ttoatsh iner mi’night air. I’ve bin watchln’ one
fler iarst hour on my verandah. He’sh evid’ntly
drunk, or wantsher rob my office.” The “ foorce
was soon on the battle-field, and the affrighted
editor, pointing, cried, “ That’sh him; that’sh er
scoundr’l up against er wall; arresh him at once
an’ I’ll proshecute.” “ Prosecute be jammed,” ex-
claimed the sergeant, as he slid off in disgust;
“ why, that’s your own wlnd-and-weather black-
board. Sober up, or I'll have to arrest you.”
Selections from the Battle of Waterloo
were recently given with great eclat in an oyster
saloon in Swanston-street, Melbourne, where, it
appears, a frivolous party of Johnny Crapeaux
were having supper, and a cray-flsh, which was
served, not pleasing them, they generously tossed
it over the partition into the next box, where a
couple of perfidious Albion’s sons were surround-
ing oyster stews. The fish took one of the English-
men a nasty welt over the jowl, and he promptly
retaliated by flinging a heavy bottle over the nar-
tition, which broke the nose of the original offen-
der. The Frenchmen then threw over a whole
cruet-stand, which struck one of the English party,
who jumped up on the seat and sent it flying back
again. The Frenchmen then left their box to
pursue the fight; the Englishmen, outnumbered,
removed their supper to the seats and turned the
table up on the doorway, completely barricading
it. The Frenchmen hurled their plates, knives,
cruets, and fish over the table, and the Englishmen
retaliated by emptying their oyster stews over the
faces and dress clothes of their assailants. All this
time the language used was of the most high-flown
and ornamental character, and when the police
lent their mite to swell the storm, the saloon
looked, and felt, and smelt, like a drunken lunatic
asylum on fire; and now, as the papers naively
say, “everybody is to be prosecuted, of course,
but as they fire all ‘ highly respectable,’ a few
pounds will ‘ square ’ the whole matter.”
“ Oh! it’s yes, my Lord, and it’s no, my
Lord,” with Granny of late to such an extent that
the old harridan bids fair to soon become the
champion journalistic lickspittle outside of Lon-
don. Speaking of St. Vincent’s hop, a few days
ago, for Instance, our servile Jeames observes—
“ His Excellency Lord Loftus and suite, were re-
ceived by Sir Patrick Jennings and the members
of the ball committee, and escorted to the seats
reserved. Lord Augustus, however, preferred
mingling with the company, saluting and chatting
pleasantly with the ladies with whom he was
acquainted, and bringing a rosy flush to more than
one youthful cheek by his kindly greeting and
inquiries as to the state of the programme, and
the number of dances to be secured. After some
time His Excellency was conducted to! a private
supper room, where refreshments were served, and
he soon afterwards left.” Lovely, lovely, is it not?
In fancy’s eye we seem to see the giddy oid masher
chassezing round ’mid the low-nesxed throng;
stopping now to exchange a word with Mrs. Fin-
yookin about a new cross he has made by associat-
ing lhalf a dozen long-eared Brahmapootra hens
with a Madagascar monkey; anon graciously en-
quiring how Lady Lobbyjob succeeded with her
clutch of ring-tailed Cochin China’s, and then sud-
denly bringing a rosy flush, like the first symptoms
of a goldarned “rash,” to the youthful cheek of
the beauteous Miss Marguerite Malowney, as he
taps her playfully under the gills, and gallantly
remarks she is the prettiest little pullet in the
whole nest. Granny must have her little
joke, however, and so, in her own sly
way, she draws attention to the fact that
the refreshments being served, His Excel-

for seventeen years ; not able to walk except on
hands and knees for one year : not able to help
hbnself for eight years : tried hundreds of reme-
5 “ . doctors pronounced his case hopeless ; per-
manently cured by Cuticuba Resolvent inter-

CUTICURA REMEDIES are the greatest medi
cines on earth. Had the worst case Salt Rheum
in thla country. My mother had it twenty years,
and in fact died from it. I believe Cuticuba would
have saved her life. My arms, breast, and head
were covered for three years, which nothing re-
lieved or cured until 2 used the Cuticuba Resol-
vent internally, and Cuticuba and Cuticuba
Soap externally. J. W. Adams, Newark, O.jR

Gentlemen, — I have
never before given a tes-
timonial,but am willing
to eneourage tbe use of
an honest remedy. 1
am so pleasedwith your
hair brush that 1 deem
it my duty to write you
recommending it most
cordially. My hair,
about a year since,
commenced falling
out, and I was rapid-
ly becoming bald ;
but, since using the
brush, a thick growth
of hair lias made its
appearance, quite
equal to that which I
had previous to its
falling out. I have
tried other remedies
but without success.
After this remarkable
result I purchased one
for my wife, who has
been a great sufferer
from headache, and she
finds it a prompt and
infallible remedy.

be quite free from any deleterious ingredients.

VARIOUS VERSES.
[FOR THE BULLTIN.]
A Hymn to Humbug.
VERSES UNTO VICE.
ORANGE MEMBERS AND ORANGE MEN.
’Tis said that, in Australia’s early days,
Some Scotchman noticed with admiring gaze
The waving grass of Bathurst’s rolling plain
Green with the influence of sun and rain:
Fair was the prospect—well might he content
Rest with the gifts a generous soil had sent—
Well might he thank St. Andrew that his lot
Was cast on such a highly favoured spot.
But, no: his so-called patriotic mind
Yearned for the thistle he had left behind
When leaving Scotland, so he sent for seed
And through his paddocks sowed the cursed weed.
Strongly it grew-such stature ne’er before
Had it attained on Scotia’s rugged shore.
Great was his pride to note the autumn gale
Roar its winged seeds -but soon, so goes the tale.
Dismal forebodings triumphed o’er his soul
To see his nursling grown beyond control.
Now from each district where the weed has spread
Continuous Imprecations seek the head
Of him, impelled by vain and selfish thought,
Who to this land has such an evil brought.
Great was his folly; but, still, not so great
As their’s who, seeing Austral’s peaceful state
Torn by no difference on points ot creed
(Tho’ worship differed then, men’s faith agreed)—
Men aiding Churches, not for sake of strife,
But as a meant to nobler, purer life —
First introduced to m ir the prosperous scene
Fierce faction's badge of orange and of green.
When Englishmen, in sixteen eighty-eight,
Forced James ot York, their king, to abdicate,
Tho Orangemen were leagued to overthrow
The power of freedom’s most relentless foe;
And well they fought in the Usurper’s cause
To save their land, their liberties, and laws.
But in this new Britannia none need fear /
To lose the liberties which all hold dear;
Yet, still, the Orangemen live by pretence
of guarding rights which are their own defence.
And strive that base religion to promote
Which prompts each man to clutch his neigh-
bour’s throat.
As children quake when told that Bogie’s near,
So there are Orangemen who really tear
They may be forced to wear a Papal yoke—
So join the Lodge to foil a phantom stroke;
But there are many who, with viler aim.
Gain their own ends by trading on the name
Of loyalty, and this Ingenious dodge
Prompts most of those that join an Orange Lodge:
And yet they count some good men—as a rule
One man in fifty’s neither rogue nor fool.
And yet these men oft by their votes prevail
To turn a close election’s wavering scale;
The man who with their dictates most complies,
No matter what his creed, they patronize;
He who will sink each patriotic thought
To do their will, is sure of their support:
Their will may be condensed to one line’s scope,
“ Get billets for our sons, and blank the Pope! ”
Would that I could in capitals denote
Those who have purchased thus the Orange vote:
Would that my verse could show what games are
played
By some of those who thrive by Orange aid!
But 1 must hold tho censure In suspense
Till libel-laws count truth as good defence;
Must pass in silence all the past career
Of many “ things ” whom Orangemen revere;
And, as 1 may not write unless to laud,
Must pass unnoticed here the "PastGrand Fraud,”
And let the praise of Murray and M‘Coy
Send through their frames a thrill of holy joy I
Nor may I speak of him, “ Pride ot the South,”
Who in the Assembly sits with closed mouth,
And ne’er unveils to elevate mankind
The mighty workings of his mighty mind—
Heft ot Ambition’s spur, his one desire
Is to obtain the berths his friends require;
To help his country he has no design.
But favours friends with billets on the line.
As oft in troubled sleep we writhe with fear
To see some dream-born danger drawing near,
And with an effort cast off slumber’s chain
And find ourselves in safety once again,
So did this country, for long time oppressed
By tho-e whom Orangemen esteemed the best,
Wake from her sleep and break the Grange spell
When Henry Parkes and his supporters tell.
How are the mighty fallen! Where are they
Who once had power the listening crowds to sway?
Where is John Davies, who was once so well-
Beloved by every Sydney L.O.L. ?
With Humbug’s wings to height of fame once
soared,
But now he’s kicked from an Insurance Board—
(’Tis said his leisure hours he’s using well
By making “ hats ” and learning how to spell.)
Where's Dr. Kenwlck ? gone back to his pills ?
Let’s hope they ’re better than his Forest Bills.
Where’s Tombstone Roseby ? now no more shall
roll
That lofty speech that showed the lofty soul.
Where’s he who heard the “Murmurs of the
Stream ? ”
Where’s Watson,with his Wool Taxation Scheme?
Ah! though Sir Henry still contrives to gain
A complimentary Excursion train —
Though dismal Watson just contrived to beat
A better man for the last vacant seat—
Yet from them both the power they loved has fled.
And now they lie, politically, dead.
ISHMAEL.
Tom Short.
Tem Short was a cobbler, s j deft at his trade
That the shillings rolled on him in plenty;
And so brilliant a prospect in lito was displayed
That he married and settled at twenty-one.
His married life differed from most married lives.
For, before seven winters were over,
He’d successively married and planted five wives
Decorously under the clover-beds.
He married no more. Having buried his cares,
Ho was getting along like a cherub,
Till be fell, one fine day, from the top of the stairs*
And damaged his system—O, terribly 1
Of course he was tenderly carried to bed,
And they sent for an eminent doctor;
Who said to the nurse, with a sh ke ot his head,
“He’s a gon'-rl which fearfully shocked her
nerves.
When the cobbler heard this, he said, “ Since it laser,
I desire you the parson to bring, too;
For, when I go to glory, I’d ju&t like to know
Which, of all my late wives, I’m to cling to
there?”j
The parson was nuzzled, but not so the nurse;
For she said “I maintain hard and fast
That, quote as you will from your chapter and
verse,
A cobbler should stick to his last.” See ?

N EVER previously did any piano win such a hold
on the public as the Mignon has done since
its introduction. Our competitors have no doubt
donp their level best to rival us— blazoning 1 forth
their bald imitations with a tremendous flourish
of trumpets. What result hare they to show,
excepting to point to the gradual death of all their
offspring? The reason is soon found. Inferior
instruments, with showy exteriors, have been
brought forth and attempted to be foisted on the
public. But the right-thinking public will have
none of them. The consequence is that the
Sales of the Mignon Piano
have Trebled.
THE MIGNON PIANO
has found its way into every town almost of all
the colonies-ln Victoria and New South Wales,
from north to south ; to the far north of Queens-
land ; in Now Zealand, from one end to the other
of the islands. In South Australia and Tasmania
THE MIGNON
can be found, and its n?Ae is really a household
word.
THE MIGNON PIANO
is the people’s favourite.
THE MIGNON PIANO
for its size defies all would-be imitations.
THE MIGNON PIANO
is guaranteed to withstand any climate in Australia.
THE MIGNON PIANO
is the cheapest, because the best.
THE MIGNON PIANO

AYER’S
Hair Vigor
restores, with the gloss and freshness of
youth, faded or gray hair to a natural, rich
brown color, or deep black, as may be desired.
By its use light or red hair may be darkened,
thin hair thickened, and baldness often,
though not always, cured.
It checks falling of the hair, and stimu-
lates a weak and sickly growth to vigor. It
prevents and cures scurf and dandruff, and
heals nearly every disease peculiar to the
scalp. As a Ladies’ Hair Dressing, the
Vigor is unequalled ; it contains neither oil
nor dyo, renders the hair soft, glossy, and
silken in appearance, and imparts a delicate,
agreeable, and lasting perfume.
Mr. C. P, Brichek writes from Kirby, O..
July 3, 1882 : “ Last fall my hair commenced
falling out, and in a short time 1 became
nearly bald. I used part of a bottle of
Ayer’s Hair Vigor, which stopped the fall-
ing of the hair, and started a new growth. 1
have now a full head of hair growing vigor-
ously, and am convinced that but for the
use of your preparation 1 should have been
entirely'bald.”
J. W. Bowen, proprietor of the McArthur
(Ohio) Enquirer, says : “ AVer’s Hair Vigor
is a most excellent preparation for the hair.
I speak of it from my own experience. Hs
nse promotes the growth of new hair, and
makes it glossy and soft. The Vigor is also
a sure cure for dandruff. Not within my
knowledge has the preparation ever failed
to give entire satisfaction.”
Mr. Angus Faiubairn, leader of the
celebrated “ Fairbairn Family ” of Scottish
Vocalists, writes from Boston, Mass., Feb. 6,
1880 : “ Ever since my hair began to give sil-
very evidence of the change which fleeting
tune procureth, I have used AVer’s Hair
Vigor, and so have been able to maintain
an appearance of youthfulness — a matter of
considerable consequence to ministers, ora-
tors, actors, and in fact every one who lives
in the eyes of the public.”
Mrs. O. A. Prescott, writing frem 18 Elm
St., Charlestown, Mass., April 14, 1882, says :
“ Two years ago about two-thirds of mv hair
came off. It thinned very rapidly, and'l was
fast growing bald. On using Ayer’s Hair
Viqor the falling stopped and a new growth
commenced, and in about a month my bead
was completely covered with short hair. It
has continued to grow, and is now as good as
before it fell. I regular! y used but one bottle
of the Vigor, but now use it occasionally as
a dressing.”
We have hundreds of similar testimonials
to the efficacy of Ayer’s Hair Vigor. It
needs but a trial to convince the most skepti-
cal of its value.

With a laudable desire to give his new
sonfrire, the distinguished impresario, Signor
M'Manus, a tashte of his powers as a dramatic
“cricket,” Thady O’Kane has just dropped on
M‘Lean’s Opera Company and the “ Woman of the
People” In a style calculated to make the crowd
long for an opportunity to saw Thady’s head off
with a broken bottle and throw it down a well.
First of all, the party who played Bairetrong, the
ohamplon “ drunk, ,r excited feelings of the most
intense disgust in the minds of the Charters
Towers Slite by his milk and watery portrayal of
the character. Bairetrong, it appears, came on as
the genial, maudlin’, sholly-goo -f’ler boozer, and.
Instead of dancing round the stage with a gory
razor in one hand and a Yankee axe in the other,
while be spat fire, and gibbered at the barber’s-
pole-coloured snakes that were squirming about
on the floor, he simply sat down in the Woman of
the People s lap and offered to “shinga com o
strong ” if she went round the corner and got blm
a gill of rum in a ginger-beer bottle. Naturally
enough, this made the experienced Towers people
feel sick, and, after crumpling up the insipid dead-
beat in his own particularly peppery style, Thady
Indignantly declares he “ knows scores of citizens
who could give him points in a good old drunk
and then beat him hands down.” The giddy
“ Woman ” herself, came off better, as we learn
she acted “with a natural ease and grace that
would make one almost believe she knew all
about it, or, as Bamee would say, she was aufatt ”
(etc). The rest of the performers were decidedly
too thin, however; for Thady winds up by observ-
ing: ” On the whole, the * Curse of Drink’ is not a
success!” (Brother Ploton, of the Never-Touoh-
Its, might make a note of that lot for the benefit
of those who consider the “Curse” to bo a big
boom.) “Seme parts are passable, and a great
many others are objectionable. We would not
advise its repetition here, though it may possibly
hit the taste of a one-horse bush town.” Gramni-
vorous Nebuchadnezzar! is this the contemptuous
way the alligator-fed heathens talk of that drama
in which the ger-rate ter-radgedlan sent parsons
howling to their prayers, delicate females into fits,
and caused strong men to swoon away (to the
pubs, before eleven), and does the libelous wretch
still live who dares to designate Sydney, the Queen
of the South, as a “ one-horse bush town ?” After
that, lot us have a suck-in edishin of the Deluge.
“ Demned hard work, this, Schneiss. Bad
air, stuffy room. Aw, make haste, let me out, aw.”
“ Ylsh, mein son, dat I had times as easy. Dis way,
mein son. Jeminl, pull ’em up somefat higher.
Easy times, mein son.” “Easy times—aw! At it
In office up till four. Now on it for two hours.
Easy? Demned hard, I say. You’ll twist my neck
off. Schneiss I Demned but I’ll knock you down I”
“ Soft, mein son, soft. Dis is a now rig. It must
strike the eye. Ef you gave me to place leetle
card but, no, mein son ” “ Decidedly no.
Not for your shop, Schneiss. Hurry, confound
you; I’m getting suffocated in here. Shore on
whak you like, but hurry.” “ It is new style, mein
son, and it must strike the eye to match the model
in the vindow. Put out dis arm. Jeminl! It is
goot. Turn now. Ah, mein son, it is not yet as I
vouldvish. Let me put on dis coat. Jemlni! I
tinks dis is right. Now, turn round; valkover
dere. Jemini!” “ Get me the hat, Schneiss.”
“Take time, mein son; plenty time. Bo always
slow and sure. Dat is goot. Step over dere. Dat
does. Ef I mash moneys as easy, mein son, I’d be
a rich man dis day. Step over dere. It is goot.
Now, dis hat. Vait, vait, no hurry; don’t be in a
hurry, mein son. A leetle, just a leetle, over dat
side. Step over dere. Valk over here. Step over
dere. It is goot. How many friends you ex-
pects to meet dis day ? Mind, mein son, from
the Post Office to Swanston-street. Two hours,
up and down; slow, stately. Dis is the newest
style. Dat finger is filled veil in dat glove. Step
over dere. Step over here. Step———” “Oh,
hang it, Schneiss, I ” “Jemini! Mein son.
don"t lift your arm dat vay. De garment don t
allow it. I charge for damages. I stops damages
out of five bob. Jeminl, you fly in do face of for-
tune. You be poor man yet, mein son, ef you
don’t vatch. Step over dere. Step over here.
Valk over dere.” “ Will that do, Schneiss ? It
is goot. Two cigars! Jemini, it is waste, but It sets
off. Stretch arm dis vay. Cane in left hand. Step
over dero. Stop over here. Dat is goot. Now
mein son, fen peoples say ‘Nice togs,’ you say
‘Schneiss,’ nnd so on. Five bobs fen you come
back. Five bobs in two hours by de clock. Jeminl I
fat a lot of moneys. Ach, mein son, you vill be a
rich man von day. Five bobs! Jemini! Dis vay
out. mein son. Five bobs! Joost tin k, O Jemini.
Now, what is all this? It is only an Australian
Childe Harold who works in a Melbourne banking
house for £90 a year, and who, as he is at present
honest, trios to make a trifle extra on Saturdays
by doing the block for two hours, at balf-a-orown
an hour, in the capacity of a tailor’s model. When
you see him so spotlessly perfect in his attire, and
leading the newest fashions, do not blame the
young man. His nose is in the air, but Schneiss
won’t pay him if he doesn’t carry it there. His Up
is curled, but Schneiss insists that it shall be so.
Altogether, he is the picture of a coxcomb, but,
kindly reader, remember what we have told you,
and bo humane. Childe Harold is trying to be
honest.
We have often thought to ourselves what
a capital joke it would be to give the whole of the
understrappers of the Civil Service carte blanche
and a free pardon, to print and publish a record of
all the grievances, real, and imaginary, which
they consider exist in their different departments.
How the talented, but friendless old deadbeats in
the “ Lands,” who have grown bald in the service
through so many younger but well-connected
noodles stepping over their heads, would revel in
the tales they would unfold, aud what a yell of
triumph and revenge would burst from the
throats of the Siberian slaves who have groaned
solong under the despotic sway of ex-Czar Wil-
kins. From time to time we are requested to
pubUsh little growls from divers departments;
and it is gratifying to know that the most satis-
factory results have followed. Even as a mild
answer turneth away wrath, so also does a gentle
newspaper hint work more real reform than a 10-
volume report of a Select Committee. Apropos
of this, a party who signs himself “ A Grasser
writes to know why it is that the vouchers for
over-time, travelling expenses, &c., which are sent
in by the lower classes of Telegraph officials are
sometimes held over for three months, while those
of the upper ranks can, if necessary, be rushed
through in as many days. As a sample of the
inconvenience arising from this injustice, he cites
the case of an operator who, having travelled a
considerable distance to take charge of an out-of-
the-way station for a few months, wassubsequontly
compelled to to his chief as follows: “Sir,
I returned from Cooreenyrangacoomboobllah
Station, and sent in my vouchers for expenses
amounting to £37 Us. 6d. ten weeks ago, but have
not received a cent up to the present date. I
therefore beg for a fortnight’s leave of absence to
enable me to place my family in the poor-house,
prior to my being incarcerated in the debtors
prison. Yours obediently,” &c. This trouble evi-
dently lies between the officials of the Telegraph
Department and the Treasury, and is wholly inex-
cusable. Ai'd this reminds us that it has now been
decided by the Cabbage Garden authorities to re-
duce the charge for telegrams there to Id. a word.
The Service Government does not pretend to say
that the business done justifies reduction—as a
matter of fact, the Post Office and Telegraph De-
partments are worked at a loss of £100,000 a year—
but they very properly look upon telegraphic com-
munication as a matter of great importance, and
one which should be so worked as to come within
the moans of all. When the question was first
mooted, the Telegraphic officials loudly howled
that it would bo impossible to do the extra work,
that the loss to the revenue would be simply ruin-
ous, and the whole world turned upside-down by
the disastrous innovation. Nevertheless, Mr. Ser-
vice sees his way clear to grant this groat boon to
the general public, even though it may cause a
few of the said public’s servants to earn their
salaries; and, now, we fail to see any just cause or
impediment why Mr. Stuart should not follow in
the steps of Mr. Service.
One hundred millions of pounds of butter
are sold annually in New YorK city, and of this 50
per cent, is bogus. The “factitious” article la
either “ butterine ” (t.e. an admixture of lard aud
good butter, half-and-half), “ suine ” (which copies
under the head of butterine, but contains more
lard), or “ oleomargarine ” (which is made of grease
of any and ail kinds—tallow, lard, cotton-seed, pea-
nut; and other oils are sought for and obtained
from all sources and from all countries). “These
fats are deodorised and neutralised by treatment
with nitric acid, mixed with milk, cream, or poor
butter, and churned. The acid in this composition
is, of course, very deleterious, and in proportion
to its quantity is the resultant injury. Many of
these products can scarcely be told from genuine
butter, even by experts, and tests by microscope
and sulphuric acid are essential to determine their
true character.” But the most delightful revela-
tion contained in the official document, from which
we quote, is that “stakes are driven into the
sewers at London, from which stakes a fatty de-
posit, left by the current, Is scraped every day,
and, after proper treatment, this fatty deposit be-
comes dairy butter." Ugh! Ouf! Already has the
romance departed from our muffins: gone are the
voluptuous softness of our crumpets, and the ap-
petising odours which in days that are no more
announced the arrival of our genial midnight
friend, the Welsh rabbit. Never again shall the
oily yellow wavelets, which in days of yore gaily
shimmered on the sky-blue tide of our milkless
“ oyster ’’-soup, over the watery grave of the soli-
tary speechless mussel in the spoon—recall fond
memories of the happy times wherein we wan-
dered with a round and ruddy Patience over grassy
slopes where mild-eyed kine chewed the cud among
the primroses. Ah, those were pleasant times!
After “proper treatment!” we see that Henry
Ward Beecher “ thinks that the idea of the resur-
rection of the body would present a lasting objec-
tion to the Pagan custom of burning the dead,”
But, as we likewise notice that an eminent New
York official states that “oleomargarine is made
of grease of any and all kinds,” we may, without
irreverence, be permitted to presume that very
soon there will be a general resurrection, anterior
to the final one, and that all who die and are
burled, especially adipose people, will be rooted
up at midnight by the body-snatchers in the inter-
ests of practical science, as represented by Messrs.
Suine, Butterine, Oleomarglne, and Co., unlimited.
The outlook is cheerful. If we allow the poor clay
of our departed mother-in-law to be committed to
earth with the idea that we shall “ see once more
In the lily’s pallor the cold white face of the dear
dead, and trace once more in the violet s purple
the surging life-stream, which has ceased to run,”
we shall probably make a mistake, tor some of the
good lady will chemically ro-appear, not in the
daisies, or in the lilies, but in the butter-coo'er.
On the other hand. If we burn her, we ll get rid ef
her, once and tor all, unless it should hereafter
become worth the family baker's while to adulter-
ate our morning roll with phosphate of lime from
the graveyard. The Yankee’s allegation as to the
conversion of sewer-grease has dispelled our life-
dream, which was to have our bread buttered on
both sides.
Here’s an item we’d like to get rid of be-
fore the heat of Summer comes upon us. The
shrieking sisters of the Cabbage Garden Maternity
Aid Society are just going it proper over there,
and war to the knife has been declared against all
their enemies. A few days ago, a deputation con-
sisting of five of the most able-booled and glib-
tongued sisters on the Board (“shelf” seems the
better word) placed themselves under the protect-
ing wings of the Kev. Dr. Bromby and t he Kcv.
Davy Jones [!] Hamer, and waited on that chaste
Susanna in pants, old Salvation Army Graham
Berry, in order to induce him to “ push the legis-
lation already promised, which deals with the
question of seduction, and make it a criminal
offence to seduce a girl under 18 years of age.” A
gentle, timid maid. Miss Sutherland by name,
opened the ball and fairly knocked Graham over
the ropes by declaring that, out of 000 cases dealt
with by the Maternity Hospital, not more than 200
of the mothers were married women, and in only
twe oases out of the whole of the charges of this
gallant six hundred had the putative father made
any monetary provision for his victim. This re-
dounds greatly to the credit of the noble pair of
pa’s in question, and wo believe nothing but
the extreme modesty and retiring disposition of
tho thoughtful couple prevented the Maternity
matrons from presenting them with a silver cradle
each, accompanied by the usual illuminated ad-
dress and purse of sovereigns. Something had
evidently stirred old Berry’s coffee up tho
wrong way that morning, however, for ho at once
bluntly asked Miss Sutherland if the deputation
could say “ in how many cases deception had been
practised by the men, and how many cases were
due to lust on both sides V* This was such a par-
tlcularly peculiar query that it broke the Maternity
mongers up completely, and it was some time be-
fore they could find strength enough to reply,
“they couldn’t”; and, in fact, they had never
given such a horrid, hateful, monstrous, cruel, un-
feeling, libelous question a single thought. This
made the old man go on worse than ever, and he
then drew attention to the fact that, in the very
first case of seduction on record, the woman not
only sent a good man wrong but afterwards meanly
tried to shunt all the blame on to the head of a
darned old snake. Furthermore, he pointed out
it was a well-known truism that accidents hap-
pened even in the best-regulated families, and,
therefore, £reat allowance should be made in the
case of persons who had no legally-ordained
families Whatever, and, as “ women will wander
and men will stray,” no bill would be introduced
this session. That sent the prude Penelopes
off on their little pink ears immediately, and
now the Melbourne daily Press is chock full of let-
ters from indignant matrons and trembling maids,
proposing unheard-of punishments for people
who certainly would never dream of doing them
the least harm. One Mrs. Dugdale (Phoebus! what
a name I) began the row with a delicate suggestion
that “the surgeon's knife ” should be used to pre-
vent such occurrences; and, after a long series of
similar proposals, “A Mother” writes to intimate
her opinion that these wicked men should be
branded oa cheek and forehead. The latter plan
was fairly tried by the Saxons, but, so great was
the gallantry of those old Don Juans, that, after a
six months’ reign of branding had elapsed, it was
found they had no more vacant spots on either
forehead or jowl, and so they kicked up their heels
defiantly, and shouted, “ On with the dance —Jet
joy be unconflned,” as usual. Mrs. Dugdale’s sur-
gical little plan was strictly enforced by the
Ancient Egyptians, and yet, from Bameses the
king down to Rabahakeh the brlckmaker, the
whole caboodle of them were steeped to their
snuff-coloured snouts in the fashionable vices of
the day. Perhaps the most efflcacions remedy ever
thought of was that in use among the chosen
people of the rouseabout days of Moses. In those
days, the editor of Deuteronomy tells us, the
seducer was compelled to pay the injured lather
fifty sides of silver, and to marry the girl for life.
That invariably crumpled the gay deceiver all to
pieces In the first act, and the Melbourne Maternity
crowd would do well to rub the notion into old
Berry’s head at their next hallelujah meeting'.
Late developments of journalism in Ade-
laide are somewhat startling. The S.A. Register
has now become a semi-religious paper, and, before
anything, the accredited organ of the Young Men s
Christian Association. Me that is not holy must
depart from the staff. The only son of Belial
tolerated was the man who did the dramatic busi-
ness—an erratic heathen who had studied his sub-
ject. But, in future, no person will be allowed to
deal with the ungodly stage unless able to answer
dodging questions in the Catechism; to refute the
propositions of infidelity; and to repeat the Lord's
Prayer backward or forward, or each way endwise,
| from the middie at any hour of the day or night.
The office is now entirely surrendered to the de-
i vices of a young person who has attained the
degree of Canon in pietosity. On assembling in
the forenoon the reporters are gathered to the
library and the Canon offers up prayer. Then each
person is questioned by the Canon as to what he
has been doing through the night, and whether his
prescribed orisons have arisen to tne throne of
grace on awakening in the morning. The Canon
administers rebukes or delivers commendations as
occasions require, and deals unto every steno-
grapher even that which the stenographer deserv"
eth. Then the appointment book is placed on
the table, and every man receiveth his allotted
portion. The conversation is carried on hs much
as possible in Scriptural phrases and lines from the
Wesleyan and Congregational hymn-books. Tea,
prayer, and revival meetings are first marked by
reason of their greater importance. But even
these make way for all entertainments given by
the S"oung Men’s Christian Association. If the
Canon cannot himself attend, that reporter who
has best answered his spiritual adviser's questions,
and is generally reckoned to be leading a blame-
less life, receives this blessed privilege. Pious
interjaculations in the Canon’s script fill up the
pages in thabook, as thus: “Bead Qrindgod’s fare-
well, Bathurst— Selah. ‘ The Lord bless and com-
fort thee and bo a Guide unto thy right hand
pencil I’” “Y.MC.A. (Hallelujah!) committee
meeting, Boarhome —* The Lord is on my side, I
will not fear what man doeth unto me. . . I laid
me down and slept and rose up again, for the Lord
sustained me.’ Yea, even so, Lord. Even in this
graceless newspaper-office can thy servant hood-
wink the boas!” Then, near the end of the ap-
pointments: “Races. Old course. (‘ Why do the
heathen so furiously rage together ?')—Cook.
* Let him that thinketh the totalizator standeth
take heed lest it fall.’ ‘ Not unto us, O Lord; not
unto us, but unto Thy name be the glory.’ Cut it
down as much as possible.” “Theatre. The
smoke of the bottomless pit ascendeth for ever
and ever.’ —Bgremont.” A son of Belial —[Memo,
to sub-editor: Cut this man’s copy down into com-
monplace, and erase his ribald jokes.] “Astranger
in our borders, ‘ O Lord, how long ? ’ We do not
care to reproduce the extra fervid samples ot the
Canon’s art. These usual entries will serve to
show the spirit of South Australian journalism at
present. Every person engaged in the Register
establishment wears a 9-carat gold medal (bought
from a Christian at 18-carat price) bearing the
mystic legend “Y.M.C.A.” and, onpain of the in-
stant “bullet,” has the right hand tail of every
shirt and the left hand side of every collar also
marked with this heavenly sign. The Canon as
well furnishes all important correspondence under
various disguises, his latest nom de plume being
“A Layman.” Ada Campbell is shaking the
foundations of prim piousness and formal hypo-
crisy to their bases. Her lectures are attended by
crowded au fiences, composed of people who have
become weary of the Register’s gods. She lately
delivered a most admirable and Interesting lecture
on the social evil. Quoth the Canon thereanent: —
“ Some of the remarks made by the lecturess on
this subject are unfit for publication, and the S.A.
Preethought Society, who sanctioned this exhibi-
tion of female immodesty, cannot be congratu-
lated either on its sense ot decency or its regard
for the interests of public morality.’ But the
Hon. B. T. Pinniss, a cultured gentleman, whose
mental equal exists not on the Adelaide Press,
thus deprecates these pitiable slanders and their
enlargement by “A Layman”:—“The Chairman,
Mr. Henry Taylor, has written In reply to certain
strictures in your paper, and I have much pleasure
in endorsing all that he has said in that letter, and
in adding that I think all right-minded people who
heard Miss Campbell on that occasion, and they
are very numerous, will approve the verdict he
has given in her favour. For my own part I can
safely and truthfully certify that the . lecture
which has drawn forth the animadversions of
your paper and the venomous effusions of a writer
styling himself * A Layman,’ was an expression of
the soundest wisdom and morality, clothed ih
language eloquent and effective, I ever heard
in any church or public hall where ministers
of religion and professors of moral philosophy
are accustomed to deliver discourses for the in-
struction of their bearers; nor do I believe any
professor could have delivered a more instructive
lecture on the subjects she elucidated. She clothed
a difficult subject in words of the highest educa-
tional refinement, and not one single syllable left
her lips which could possibly offend the chastest
ear. It will be seen at once that I deny the truth
of the malicious statements put forth by ‘ A Lay-
man.’ For they are not only absolutely false but
they betray a fanatical, malicious sentiment
which, if shared by any sect in South Australia
and openly proclaimed, would bring such a sect
Into merited disgrace and contempt. If such a
sect really should exist, let South Australians
guard against the danger of admitting them to
get the upper hand in political power, or the fires
of Smithfleld and the tortures of the Inquisition
will be repeated in this province, even in these
civilized days of civil and religious liberty and
boasted enlightenment. There is a certain ring
about some of the expressions in the letter of ‘A
Layman’ which shows that he is a dangerous
fanatic, and one to bo shunned. Thus, he says—
‘ I will say that it would be better to dote on these
trifles, and Ignore our unfortunate sisters, than to
preach the doctrine that they should be left alone
in their sin, to live lives of misery, and at last to
go down to hell.’ I leave these words to tell their
own tale, and to justify the judgment I have past
on the writer in styling him a dangerous
fanatic. He, too, has used language in his letter
as applied to Miss Campbell which, I should
imagine, no Press editor would knowingly suffer
to appear in the columns of his paper—words of
an indecent character—never uttered by Miss
Campbell, or by any writer who has ventured to
address a South Australian public in print. They
are too outrageously Immodest to be repeated. I
could say much more in condemnation ot ‘A Lay-
man.’ But, I hate falsehood and oppression,
whether adopted under the garb of religion or
civil tyranny such as is exhibited in the effusions
of ‘ A Layman.’ I trust, although 1 condescend
to address such a writer as ‘ A Layman,’ 1 am not
placing myself on a level with such an one.” In
the issue which contained the lies concerning Ada
Campbell were three columns devoted to a de-
scription of the funeral of a Bible-Christian par-
son, who had never done anything good, bad or
indifferent, to deserve more than a half-crown
obituary advertisement. But this particular Bible-
Christian had, unfortunately, begot a political ac-
cident, which, in a “lucky” moment for other
people, was able to appoint itself Chief Justice
Ah, brethren, behoid I say unto you what a lovely
and noble institution is the “free and indepen-

This pretty garden oqstume, with half shawl and sun-bonnet, is most bacoming.
The bonnet is composed of blue sateen, and has a firm peak but soft crown. The lace
is arranged round the peak in rather large cascades, and is fulled round the curtain.
Bows and strings of satin ribbon to correspond.
