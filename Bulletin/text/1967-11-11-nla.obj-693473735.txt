ONE MORE
WEEK
SORRIER
AYE HAD our shoes shined and were
all ready to go to the Cornucopia Ball,
when we learnt, via old reliable Auntie
ABC, that it isn’t Princess So-ray-a
at all but Princess Sorrier. And as the
week went on it became sorrier and
sorrier.
LET-DOWN
CULTURALLY, we are now in a
splendid position if we happen to want
to put on another season of Aboriginal
ballet. Otherwise, last week’s appoint-
ment of Dr. H. C. Coombs as head of
both the new Aboriginal Council and
the Arts Council does not seem to get
us far.
The Arts Council move does en-
sure that the cultural bureaucrats can
feel their jobs are safe, and that there
will be even more opportunities for
them, once the Council gets a director
and staff, something which must happen
before anything at all gets filtered
through to the lowly performers.
The Government has certainly been
half-hearted about the whole business.
The fact that after all this time we
are merely getting a patchwork is a
disappointment to many in the Arts.
But the realisation that there was no-
body in Canberra, or, it seems, in the
whole country, who could put up, or
put across, the idea of an arts council
on comprehensive and forward-looking
lines, seems a reflection not on the
state of the Arts but the state of the
country. \
DIVING IN
LONG AFTER “WHIPLASH,” another
major television series is being made
by an international team for release
through networks overseas: “Riptide,”
to star Ty Hardin, and to be made by
a group cf backers comprising ATN,
Artransa, ABC/Pathe in Britain, and an
organisation called Trans-Pacific Enter-
prises, registered in Bermuda (and
therefore tax-free), and set up by Guy
Thayer, American producer of the
series.
Thayer, a veteran of Hollywood and
British television, will create the series
in collaboration with Peter Maxwell, a
director who worked on “Whiplash,”
and Jeremy Summers, whose slick
direction of several of Roger Moore’s
“The Saint” episodes bodes well for the
new series. “Riptide” deals with the
adventures of an American charter-boat
company owner, recently a widower,
who has returned to Australia to see
his father-in-law; a number of boats
under his captaincy are involved in the
series, and he is up against not only
criminals but natural disasters as well.
The aim is to show as much of Aus-
tralian locations as possible, particularly
Sydney Harbor and the Queensland
coast.
Thayer has had experience with
jungle series shot in Africa and in
eschewing stock footage, using actuality
material instead; “Riptide” will not
resort to process shots and library
material. Apart from Ty Hardin as
charter-boat boss Moss Andrews, the
cast will be entirely Australian, the
color camera work, cutting, and pro-
cessing will be done here, and the score
will 'be by Tommy Tycho. Shooting is
due to start this month and will con-
tinue for a year, 26 episodes being shot
and each taking just over a week to
make in the first instalment, then
another batch of 26, all being well.
Thayer plans to rehearse the actors on
Saturdays for his five- or six-day shoot-
ing schedule.
Because it is Australian, “Riptide”
will go in on British quota, which
means it will have no trouble securing
a good timeslot on British ABC/TV.
The script has been written by a battery
of Australian expatriates in London, all
of whom seem to have got in on the
act: Peter Yeldham, Rex Rienits,
Michael Noonan among them; and
some local writers will be used, includ-
ing Ralph Peterson. Thayer hopes that
the series will avoid too many Aus-
tralian expressions, which ruined the
effect of “They’re a Weird Mob” (that
film didn’t even get a proper release in
the United States) abroad, and that it
will lead to his company making
theatrical features with ABC/Pathe
here (they control one of the two
theatre chains in England). He blames
the lack of a film industry here on the
failure of distributors to plough back a
percentage of their “take” into local
production, thereby financing films on a
portion of their own ticket sales.
OPTIMISM
EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS may
not be the $60,000 she asked for, but
Doris Fitton is displaying enough
optimism to confound all those who talk
of the Independent Theatre’s new reper-
tory company as a gigantic gamble.
The N.S.W. Government’s recent
grant to the Independent will do no
more than pay four actors’ salaries for
three months. Nevertheless, with the
first program barely a week old, Miss
Fitton, the Independent’s director, is
already looking over six new plays from
which to choose the next. “The Investi-
gator,” by Peter Weiss, a play about
the Nuremberg Trials, is one of them.
We’re waiting to hear from New York
about the rights of that one. “Anniver-
sary,” by Bill Macllwraith, is another,
and Joe Orton’s play “Loot” is one.
Would the theatre be able to con-
tinue with the new repertory program
if the current run is not as successful
as is hoped?
“Yes, I think so. We’ve put in for a
second subsidy. We should know about
that when they bring down the Budget
at Christmastime. It doesn’t matter if
we don’t get the cheque immediately, as
long as we know the money’s coming.
We have a membership of 500, too.”
Nine hundred dollars of another
grant from the Elizabethan Trust has
already gone into making alterations to
the theatre. Salary for a staff of 15
and the company of nine actors is now
the main running cost. “We have three
stage managers, a company secretary,
and then, of course, there are the three
directors. None of the staff gets paid
very generously, including myself, and
ALL THEIR OWN WORK

doctors of philosophy in the Public
Service.

You could buy two
‘reasonably good’
suits tor the price
ot one Parini
So if you find that something ‘reasonably good’
satisfies your needs, forget Parini The hundred
dollars or so you pay for a Parini makes sense
only to the man who finds pleasure and stimulus in
a degree of tailoring craftsmanship that amounts
to art.
The Parini wearer is usually of top-level executive
status. This is partly because such a man can afford
Parini. Partly because such a man usually got where
he is through a habit of never settling for anything
but the very best.

FROM $B5 TO $l5O

the theatre rent is only nominal, but we
do need more money.
“The subscription system by which
we’re selling a lot of tickets doubles
the work on the staff. They have to
answer all the letters. But it is a good
way to get money in hand! Look what
it’s done for the symphony concerts.”
This bold attempt at full-time reper-
tory on a shoe-string also doubles the
work of Miss Fitton herself. It was the
day of the opening, and she had half
an hour between rehearsals, organising
a dinner party, and arranging the
flowers in the theatre, a job which is
specially hers. (“No one else seems to
be able to do them as well.”)
On the side of her life no one ever
seems to write about, she is Mrs. Tug
Mason, with seven grandchildren. She
and her husband and two elderly dogs
live in a gracefully furnished house
within walking distance of the Inde-
pendent. And on the day of the open-
ing a lot of people were walking it, all
of them looking flustered.
The most unflappable was, of course,
Doris Fitton herself. Her hair looked a
little disordered, but otherwise she
seemed vaguely detached from the
freneticism as she looked vaguely across
at the park, where her housekeeper was
walking the dogs.
“I’ve wanted to do repertory ever
since I came back from abroad 18
months ago and saw that the most
interesting theatres are playing reper-
tory. Then Robert Levis came back
fired with the idea, and I said, ‘Right.
Let’s go.’ I felt the theatre was at a
standstill and we had to do something
to make it move forward.”
The first repertoire series, “Three
Views of Love and Marriage,” is made
up of two long-established plays, Shaw’s
“Getting Married” and T. S. Eliot’s
“The Cocktail Party,” with one new
play, “Staircase,” by an English play-
wright, Charles Dyer. The last, a
comedy about homosexual love between
two aging London hairdressers, is the
one Miss Fitton has chosen to pro-
duce.
“Alexander Hay and Brian James are
in it. Brian James came back from
London to be in the company, you
know. He’s a wonderful actor. I wrote,
told him I was forming a repertory
company, and he came back.”
The names of the actors in the com-
pany read like a short roll-call of some
of Sydney’s most established players—
Aileen Britton, James Condon, Alexan-
der Hay, Jacqueline Kott, Patricia
Leehy, Donald Macdonald. “Carmen
Duncan and Ross Thompson are new-
comers. I chose them from all the work
I’d seen of theirs before. I never hold
auditions—they’re too bewildering.
“These are all true professionals and
they’re nice people. We always have
nice people in our plays—you can say
that. They think this is a marvellous
idea. It means, well, it means security
for them.”
One wonders if it will mean security
for Miss Fitton, or if, after 38 years of
brinkmanship, she’d know what to do
with it.

Trooping

Natives
NEW GUINEA can be sure of at least
one growth industry—tourism. To meet
demand, the Mount Hagen Show, at
which these pictures were taken, may
become one of those apcient ceremonials
like Trooping the Color that have to
be kept on for the tourist trade. It
makes a good picture in a travel
brochure and a handy event to include
in an all-inclusive tour. But it raises
the problem familiar to tourist countries
that, while the tourists go there to see
the picturesque past, the natives want
to use the tourists’ money to buy their
way out of the past.

Must be a link missing here.
Any area of your business relying on
"blotter calculation" ? Then, frankly, you
have a link missing. A vital link in a
system planned not only to cut out such
risky "blotter calculations”, put to bring
you a dramatic increase in overall effici-
ency and hence contribute to a greater
profitability.
For instance, our experts can after
a fact-finding survey plan a Link-
System for you in which you link a
Remington Calculator to a Remington
accounting machine linked to a Rem-
ington Rotaprint.
Even with the basic system you would
be in an advantageous position of being
able to calculate, handle all book-keeping
details, typing, and at the same time
print all necessary documents even
in colour.
Get the idea? And whatever Link-
System you may need, we also guarantee,
without cost to you. to train your staff
(including EDP people) to efficiently
operate that system. Your enquiry will
be given our experts' complete concen-
tration. And security. All obligation-free
of course.

The upper crust
rising unsteadily
to the occasion
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
YE GODS! Two society-page girls
actually turn down $5O worth of free
invitations to the Cornucopia Presenta-
tion Ball. Unbelievable. What else?
Well, Nola’s reported saying (jokingly)
she’ll not be here tonight, she wouldn't
know anyone. Someone thinks she’s
gone to the country. Peter Hanlon’s re-
ported saying (not jokingly) it’s won-
derful doing Soraya’s hair, but suppos-
ing she finds out he’s a journalist, too?
Heaven forbid. Interior decorator
Leslie Waiford suggests roping off the
area where she dances with pale pink
ropes to tone in with his Persian decor,
donated free of charge. Mrs. John
Excell, the ball’s honorary secretary,
is not going to be roped off for anyone.
Mr. Waiford also sends out personal
little notes with the $25 invitations
written in esoteric socialese: “I sug-
gested you ought to get one of these
—l’m sure our friends would enjoy it.
And you!” The Press arrangements
are haywire and Peter Morrison, who’s
doing them for nothing, says he must
be mad. One committee member is
resigning. Another’s absented herself
to Fiji. Mothers are in tears as to which
daughters present bouquets, and, all
week,, everywhere Soraya turns she is
given flowers to use up all the off-
spring. They do say the Cornucopia
committee will never be the same again
after all this.
Tonight, however, is the culmination
of Soraya’s visit to Sydney: the ball at
the Menzies in aid of the Children’s
Medical Research Foundation, attended
by 400 or so guests beside themselves
with excitement to be inhaling the same
air as Her Highness Princess Soraya
Esfandiary, and all the women in what
television personality Maggie Tabberer
calls fab jools and fab fashion, their
hair back-combed till it’s torture, and
the men in strangled, frilled dinner
shirts.
Leslie Walford’s standing by the
official U-shaped table looking as if he
owned it. Lady Dods collapses into a
chair and says her poor feet. Mervyn
Horton surfaces and says tonight he’s
a guest, he’d not pay $25 for anything.
Down in the basement they discover
parking is not free, as promised; it’s
60 cents, says the garage man, he

doesn’t care what ball is going on. It
kinda takes the icing off the cake,
moans a man in white tie and tails.
At 8.30 the Princess arrives. Sydney’s
upper crust rise to their feet, some a little
unsteadier than others (there have been
pre-ball parties going on all over the
city since six o’clock), and push forward
to get a better view. They see Soraya in
strapless tangerine, the enigmatic Gloria
in plunging primrose, a bashful James
Fairfax, and the now famous Ignacy
(Wiska) Listwan looking a great deal
thinner than at the beginning of the
week, and tonight circling around the
Princess like a protective convoy.
Well, no wonder, after what hap-
pened on the Angelina Lauro. The
Captain himself turned round and said,
“Will all those who love me follow me?”
and led Soraya off. The UP man had
never seen anything so fantastic. He
was going to send it up in cables. A
society-page girl said if only she dared
she’d start her piece with, Have You
Ever Wondered What It Feels Like In
a Goldfish Bowl? The way everyone
gawked. It was terrible.
So tonight Mrs. Listwan is protective
and a stone lighter. Sir Lorimer Dods,
chairman of the Children’s Medical
Research Foundation, looks a different
man, too, after the week’s events, but
tonight what’s pleased him is the way
crowds gathered when Soraya left the
Australia Hotel to clap and cheer.
Usually Australians say “Coo.”
Suddenly Mrs. Listwan feels the
heat. A sharp look to a nearby waiter
and he springs to her side, removing
her long evening coat, a garment which
is all the rage even if it kills you in
the heat. The 12 debutantes chosen
after much deliberation upon breeding
and education are presented to the
Princess by Lady Berryman, who does
it all without a smile, and are later
kissed by parents for doing a grand
job. Then Dr. Listwan swings Soraya
into the first dance of the evening. It
ends rather abruptly when another
guest takes over. Dr. Listwan’s mouth
hovers over the royal gloved hand.
Soraya removes it very quickly.
What everyone keeps asking is, who
is Gloria? Gloria Massoudi, Soraya’s
travelling companion. Well, it is
officially denied that they are school
buddies. Actually they met through
Gloria’s father, a newspaper tycoon in
Persia. For some reason her age is a
State secret, but everyone says she
looks 20, and here she is on the scene
again after the flu, and all the men
are very pleased. And who got the job
as Soraya’s escort? Was it, as suggested,
one of those four well-known Sydney
bachelors James Fairfax, Leslie Wal-
ford, Dickie Keep, Charles Lloyd-
Jones, or Mr. Harry Miller? No, it was
not. It was Mr. Askin, Premier of
N.S.W. They engage in desultory con-
versation. Soraya’s not much of a talker,
neither does she like being interviewed.
Interviews, she says, are for politicians.
Down the road, Sydney’s theatrical
upper-crust are attending the first night
of “The Taming of the Shrew.”

BATMAN’S
GOLD COAST
A cry in agony:
"Save the
parking meters!"
THERE’S AN OLD saying at Surfers
Paradise, “Go to Brisbane for the day,
come back the next morning and you
will need a guide to show you around.”
This sort of thing still goes on, the
amount of building that is taking place
is quite astonishing.
However, Surfers doesn’t really
change. You will be interested to hear
she is still her same dear, spoiled, garish
self. Surfers has a special gift for irony.
It was intriguing to note that the build-
ings which were in danger of dissolving
into the surf some months back had
names like “The Sands,” “The Dunes,”
“White Caps,” “Rolling Waters,”
“Calm Down,” and “Overboard.”
Before the names meant nothing, now
they seem marvellously strong and
meaningful.
Actually, this place is an example of
the cleverest public relations in Aus-
tralia and it still goes on. Your corres-
pondent while pining in the Mel-
burnian winter received a little glass
phial of sand. It was pure and white.
The Surfers PR man had made sure of
this by washing it, then cooking it in
his oven at home. The message on the
phial just said, “Some of the sand that
has returned to the Gold Coast.”
The truth is that the council has
done a fair job in restoring the beach. It
is still narrower and lower than it was
before. They are spending $4,800,000
in building it up and remaking the
esplanade. This came in a loan, repay-
able over 25 years. However, there has
been one saving. At the height of the
storm, when the esplanade was
crumbling, these immensely practical
people remembered to save the parking
meters. Furthermore, they were one of
the first items to go back.
We are closing in now on the cyclone
season and, provided someone up there
likes Paradise, Surfers will get by. Busi-
ness has been a little slack since the
storm. Remember Garfield Towers, the
nine-storey apartment block that was in
danger of toppling into the water? At
one stage an early-morning radio news
Batman, on holidays, writes from
the Gold Coast this week
service in Melbourne actually
announced it had gone.
Well, Garfield is still there, strength-
ened by submerged motor-car bodies,
concrete, and thousands of Besser
bricks. It has a sign outside, “A WON-
DERFUL OPPORTUNITY—IMME-
DIATE POSSESSION —FOR SALE
DIRECT FROM THE DEVEL-
OPERS.” There’s no doubt about it,
you do get a beaut view of the surf,
practically straight down.
Yet in a strange way, despite its
mix-up in architecture, despite the greed
in building out the views, the lack of
trees, and all the appalling La Vegas-
style signs, I’m rather fond of the
place. There’s always something to talk
about.
Here’s the best story going the
rounds. An all-male revue has been
appearing on the Coast. There’s a very
nice bar in the heart of Surfers, the
only bar for many a mile that caters
for mixed company. A gorgeous dish
from the all-male revue got in there in
working dress. Naturally, it wasn’t long
before someone was buying him a
drink.
After about the eighth drink the
Colony people thought the revue-man,
or birdman as the type is known on the
Coast, should desist. The birdman,
taking offence, threw his glass of beer
over the Colony man.
Thereupon he was tossed struggling
out into the street. But, 10, just then
a car load of men spotted this gorgeous
damsel in distress being manhandled.
Thereupon they beat up the Colony
man, rescue the “damsel,” take her
inside, and buy her a brandy. It all
ended up in court and the birdman
was warned against any future activities.
There are other stories that intrigue
your correspondent’s simple mind. On
the Coast you must have a gimmick.
Two tall, shapely girls, Sylvia Hamdorf
and Carol Kelsey, of Sydney, are run-
ning an apartment-cleaning business.
“Put it in the safe deposit till I come

They get around in a TR3 sports car
with brooms, vacuum-cleaner, and such
sticking up in the air. They have a
uniform for doing this, yes, silver lame
backless bikinis. This hasn’t been bad
for business. They have gone from five
to 50 apartment houses in seven
months.
Their costumes are the same canti-
lever backless variety as worn by the
Meter Maids. When the Progress Asso-
ciation first introduced the Meter
Maids they were received most un-
happily by the Gold Coast Council.
Their job was to feed parking meters
with sixpences, an utterly illegal act.
Then the Council retaliated with
Courtesy Maids.
The Courtesy Maids were pretty but
demure. They were unbikinied, uncanti-
levered. They wore demure gold lame
frocks almost to the knee. Their job
was to greet visitors and to visit any
suffering southerners who happened to
be in hospital. Meter Maids and
Courtesy Maids fought it out gold stitch
for gold stitch. Now that Bruce Small
is Mayor there is a truce and opposing
maids can talk to each other.
But let’s talk about Bruce Small.
Queensland is famous for its characters
from Clem Jones through to Big Bill
Edwards, but Alderman Bruce Small is
starting to out-character everybody.
They’re still a little bewildered on the
Coast. He has a hostile council and
the area seems to be split into the pro-
Smalls and anti-Smalls. You will re-
member Bruce Small was the Malvern
Star man, the man who made a fortune
out of everything from bicycles to real
estate.
At 72, after a savage campaign that
made even Capricornia seem dull, he
became Mayor of the Gold Coast. Now
for the past six months working an
18-hour day he hasn’t let up. He doesn’t
smoke, doesn’t drink, diets carefully,
and starts his day with a swim at 6 a.m.
What with Mr. Holt’s spearfishing, Mr.
McMahon’s squash, and Bruce Small’s
enormous health, the number of politi-
cal people now publicising fitness is be-
coming quite depressing.
But Bruce Small is also a public-
relations dream. When the London
Salvation Army Band was here, as an
old euphonium man, he conducted them
through their first hymn. He drove a
bulldozer on the beach during the
storm crisis. He took part in a 100-yard
sprint with the committee during the
recent athletic gift and won. As a
patron of the Gold Coast Judo Club,
he took a course in judo and received
an honorary Brown Belt. What’s more
he was photographed tossing the Black
Belt instructor out of the ring. At the
circus he got into the lions’ den with
the lion tamer and opened a rotary
convention in the cage with five lions.
As mentioned earlier, this place is not
dull; it’s up with everything. Just to
give you a further example of this,
in honor of the R and R American
servicemen from Vietnam, Foysters
Pharmacy now also has a sign out
“Foysters Drug Store.”

COMMENT
What are the Russians
celebrating this week?
BY
“OBSERVER”
IF KARL MARX had been alive 50
years ago this week, when the Bol-
sheviks took over in ‘Russia, he would
probably have described what happened
not as a working-class revolution but as
“Jacobinism” —a seizure of power by
professional revolutionaries. According
to Marx, what was supposed to have
happened was that the Western Euro-
pean capitalists, having created indus-
trialised societies by their enterprise,
would become creatively exhausted and
that the new and prevailing forms ot
enterprise would then come from the
workers. By these means society would
become classless, consisting of workers
developing their creative potential.
What happened in Russia was that the
Jacobins took over from the aristocrats
and capitalists and pursued the indus-
trialisation of Russia with tyrannical
brutality. Their emphasis was not on
human values but on bureaucratic sur-
vival, strategic power, and military
strength, although they spoke of this in
Marxist terms.
What the Russians now praise about
themselves is not that they are a class-
less workers’ State exploring the human
potential but that they have been
“modernised” —they are literate, they
have industrial strength, their living
standards are at last going up —and that
they are a mighty nation. Even in their
boasts of modernisation, which represent
not Marxism but the expectation of un-
developed peoples everywhere, they
have not done as well as the Japanese,
who are now in almost every way a
more “modern” society than Russia;
and, although the Japanese are not for
the moment concerned about being a
mighty nation, if they took up this aim
in the future they could give the Rus-
sians a run for their roubles.
This Russian achievement of becom-
ing modernised was not what the
October Revolution was supposed to
be about; one can even argue that
modernisation might have happened in
any case without an October Revolu-
tion. Lenin defended his un-Marxist
tactic of helping to manipulate revolu-
tion in an unindustrialised country by
projecting an image of Russia as the
catalyst of a world revolution. Accord-
ing to this theory he and his fellow
Jacobins would provide an explosive
force in Russia that would activate
both the proletarian revolution in
Western Europe and America and the
anti-imperialist peasant convulsions of
the unindustrialised world. How can the
Russians still believe this?
To their east they have the absur-
dities of Mao Tse Tung, trapping out
a terror-backed nationalist and populist
movement with tatters of Marxism. To
their west, the labor movement has
largely rejected doctrinaire Marxism
and even the Western communist
parties now seek out the more liberal
and democratic traditions of Marxism,
perhaps slowly moving toward rejection
of the Leninist Jacobin, and auto-
cratic heresies. Russia, with Eastern
Europe more or less behind it, now
lives in a world that gives it import-
ance not as a revolutionary catalyst
but as a conventional great power, de-
ploying prestige and strength in a con-
ventional way, but also using national
communist parties when it can. As a
doctrine, “world communism” has
fallen to bits.
There would seem little doubt that
to the Russians the principal danger is
Mao’s China, a National Socialist coun-
try that seems to have become so con-
cerned with the cause of national fervor
that its leaders recently enacted a revo-
lution against their own party, revolting
against themselves, as it were, for the
sake of primitive slogans, and thereby
probably handing themselves into the
power of their military: either that or
into disintegration. Their nationalist im-
petus seemed likely for a while to cap-
ture the role that Lenin had seen for
Russia in giving strength to the revolt
of the peasant countries, but its very
absurdities now mean that almost every
country in Asia is anti-Peking.
Meanwhile, in Europe the main
strength left to the communist parties
lies in their dissociation from Russian
communism. They begin to seek for
those parts of Marxism that represent
the European radical tradition rather
than the autocratic improvisations of
Russian Jacobinism and, in so far as
they are still revolutionary, it is within
the European revolutionary tradition
that they begin to dream, not a cata-
clysm of East and West impelled by the
great Eurasian land mass of Russia. If
they are to achieve influence and im-
portance in their own country it can
be only by giving away their Russifica-
tion. What “communism” would then
mean heaven only knows.
With the dream of “world commun-
ism” dissolving, the Russians are still
left with their conventional great power
status, which places on them even
greater strain than a similar status
places on the Americans. Their great
power game in the Middle East has
been unconvincing, adding to that doubt
which began with their climb down
from Cuba. Many Russian bureaucrats
must be getting sick and tired of play-
ing so many roles all over the place.
One can only hope that over the next
50 years the Russians will begin to use
their material gains to better human
purpose in their own country.
The artful dodgers
of the Labor Party
BY
ALAN
REID
THE HOLT GOVERNMENT wants
to fight the coming Senate election on
the issue of Australia’s commitment in
Vietnam and its significance to the Aus-
tralian-United States alliance. On
present performances it is going to find
it difficult to do this.
How can you fight with an opponent
who refuses to fight and runs away?
There was considerable justification
.for the description last week by Prime
Minister Harold Holt of Opposition
Leader Gough Whitlam as “the art-
ful dodger.” In the Vietnam debate
Whitlam dealt critically with the bomb-
ing of North Vietnam by the Ameri-
cans and with the desirability of secur-
ing peace. But as Holt pointed out, not
once did Whitlam mention the Aus-
tralian commitment in Vietnam and the
likely effects upon the Australian-
United States alliance if a future
Labor Government followed the direc-
tive of the Adelaide ALP Federal Con-
ference, laid down conditions for the
conduct of the war that the Ameri-
cans would almost certainly reject, and
then proceeded to withdraw Australian
troops.
Labor’s Deputy Leader, Lance Bar-
nard, was the only major Labor speaker
to face up honestly to the .position.
Barnard outlined the conditions laid
down by the Adelaide Conference for
continuance of the Australian com-
mitment in Vietnam cessation of
the bombing of the North, negotiations
with the National Liberation Front
(political wing of the Viet Cong,
against whom Australian troops are
fighting), abandonment of napalm as
too indiscriminate a weapon of war-
fare, and the withdrawal of allied troops
into holding positions. Unless these
conditions were fulfilled, said Barnard,
a future Labor Government would have
no alternative but to withdraw Aus-
tralian troops. Though Barnard did not
say so, the implication was that the
withdrawal would take place whatever
the consequences to the Australian-
United States alliance.
Dr. Jim Cairns, the Victorian who
has become identified in the minds of
both Government and Labor parlia-
mentarians as the chief spokesman for
the Labor hardliners on Vietnam, took
an unusual line.
Whether or not you agree with
Cairns, he has to be given the credit


for generally being fearless about lay-
ing his views and his reasons for reach-
ing those views on the line.
He has consistently used his influence
within the ALP to promote the thesis
that on an issue of such magnitude as
Vietnam, involving the future of the
nation, if not the world, Labor should
make its decisions forthrightly, honestly,
and without regard to possible electoral
consequences. He actually drafted much
of the resolution on Vietnam which
the Adelaide Conference laid down as
Labor policy.
On this occasion, Cairns uncharacter-
istically followed the “artful dodger”
line of his leader. He refused to discuss
Labor policy.
Cynics suggested later that it was
because for the first time for many
years Labor, right or wrong, justifiably
or unjustifiably, has the scent of office
strong in its nostrils. Cairns has endured
the frustrations of opposition for many
years now. Naturally, Cairns, like his
colleagues, would rather be a Minister
than an impotent oppositionist.
But in my view it is more likely that
Cairns went along with Whitlam,
because whatever happens in the Senate
elections there is not going to be any
■change in the present Vietnam policy.
Even if the Government faces a hostile
Senate after June 30, it is something
that it has lived with intermittently and
successfully for a long time now. The
Government will continue to control
the House of Representatives. The Viet-
nam issue was decided at the last House
of Representatives election and will not
be changed unless the Government has
a change of heart, or the Government
is changed at the next Representatives
elections nearly two years hence.
But in adhering to the Whitlam line,
Cairns developed an argument that I
believe to be untenable. His argument
was that Labor was under no obliga-
tion to deal with its policy. It was the
Government that had got Australia into
the Vietnam war. It was for the Gov-
ernment to say how it would get Aus-
tralia out of or successfully through the
war." Labor’s policy, therefore, was
irrelevant.
As I see it, this attitude cannot be
justified in a democratic society.
Politics are not always a choice be-
tween right and wrong. They’re some-
times a choice between evils, and it is
the wiser man who selects the lesser
evil.
Whatever dangers some people may
consider are inherent in the Govern-
ment’s Vietnam policy, it is not beyond
the bounds of possibility that the same
people could consider that there are
even greater dangers for Australia in
the ALP’s policy.
Because this is the reality of the
situation, the voter is entitled to know
in terms at least as precise as those
used by the Government (and the Gov-
ernment’s views on Vietnam and the
danger to the future of the Australian-
United States alliance of an Australian
withdrawal are quite clearcut) what is
the approach of the potential alternative
Government.
Farewell to Dr. Coombs’
leading from behind
BY
MICHAEL
BAUME
WILSON AND COOMBS, Wilson and
Coombs; it sounds like a musical-
comedy team or a line from a song.
But there is great significance in the
fact that these two (of the legendary
seven) “dwarfs” who came to the top
of the ’ Commonwealth public service
in the war years are a team no longer.
Sir Roland Wilson has retired after
16 years as Secretary of the Treasury
(having been replaced by another of
the “dwarfs,” Sir Richard Randall)
and now Dr. H. C. Coombs is to retire
(in practice quite soon, but in title
not until the middle of next year)
frotn the job of governor of the Re-
serve Bank that he has held for 18J
years.
Their going means far more than
that two new signatures will be appear-
ing on Australian banknotes. It repre-
sents the end of an era in which two
men dominated the creation and
administration of Australian economic
policy. What has been their record?
There can be no denying their bril-
liance, and it is true that Australia has
done pretty well since the war (Coombs
says by a mixture of good luck and
good management), and that these
two men have been major factors in
that success. But there is also no deny-
ing that the success could have been
greater; that their mistakes have held
back Australia’s development.
Dr. Coombs had a much easier ride
as the central banker than most of
his contemporaries in other countries;
he had a cudgel that he could (and
did) use whenever things looked like
getting out of hand; he had a relatively
backward and simple monetary struc-
ture to manage instead of the more
sophisticated systems of other developed
countries (which may explain the Re-
serve Bank’s dreary reluctance to let it
get more sophisticated).
There is no doubt that the Reserve
Bank will have to be a very different
sort of animal in the next 18| years
than it has been under Dr. Coombs.
The old restrictive policies that have
eased so dramatically in the past couple
of years (is it a coincidence that Mr.
McMahon has been Treasurer for this
period?) can no longer be justified;
the whole approach of the central bank
to the control of credit in Australia
has had to change because of the
changes in the very structure of the
monetary system (changes that the Re-
serve Bank under Dr. Coombs were
dreadfully slow to respond to).
There are many who would claim
that Dr. Coombs’ basic approach to
the trading banks during most of his
18J-year rule was a mistaken one.
Dr. Coombs came in when bank
nationalisation, the Chifley dream, had
been defeated. Yet under his control
the power and influence of the trading
banks was brutally cut back, leaving
a vacuum that was filled by “fringe
banking” groups, the creation and col-
lapse of so many of which heightened
the boom-slump-company crashes situa-
tion of 1960-61.
Last week he said he did not think
the trading banks could have been
given a freer rein earlier than they
were. “It would have been impracticable
at an earlier period. It would have been
impossible in the 19505; results then
(the boom and recession) would have
been much worse than they were.” But
there is a good case for arguing that
it would have been better to do this
than to allow the situation that did
develop. Not only did this continual
restriction on bank credit while the
other kinds ran free disrupt the bank-
ing system, but it added dreadfully to
the cost structure of Australian busi-
ness; bank funds are far cheaper than
those freely available from the un-
controlled fringe bankers.
It is only in very recent times that
the banks have been given a fair go
once again—and that seems only the
result of a belated realisation of the
need to spread trading bank activities
as far as possible through the mone-
tary system as a method of spreading
Reserve Bank influence. So it seems un-
real to picture Dr. Coombs in recent
times as leading a lot of reluctant
private trading bankers into this brave,
new world of modern banking tech-
niques, of money markets, of com-
mercial bills, of finance, for develop-
ment and natural resources, of flexible
interest rates, of personal loans and all
the rest of it.
The evidence suggests that in most
of these great leaps forward the gov-
ernor and his bank, like the Duke of
Plazatoro, were leading the regiment
from behind and actively holding
it back. Even if not all of the banks
shared their enthusiasm, there is no
doubt that the Wales and ANZ had
been champing at the bit for years.
One reason why Dr. Coombs’ earlier
years at the top were such poor ones
for banks was that his intellectual
superiority over the pretty inconse-
quential bank boards of the time meant
that there was no effective counter-
attack to his banking policies, many
of which were damaging to the very
fabric of banking. But this brought one
benefit: the need to be able to keep
up with Coombs meant that the trading
banks improved the quality of their
top people out of all recognition.
Bankers are no longer able to be treated
like buffoons.

The Howson affair —
only part of an inept week
T'HE AFFAIR OF Air Minister
Howson was a fitting climax to several
weeks of increasingly fierce and fervent
jostling for position in the Senate
elections. In this the use and misuse of
VIP aircraft was in itself only a minor
issue. It was the Government’s display
of its own political ineptitude that
allowed the Opposition to turn this into
something that mattered. Overall, it
was an inept week.
The VIP affair started in May, 1966,
when Senator Vince Gair of the DLP
asked for confirmation of a report
that the ALP Federal Executive had
travelled to Perth by a VIP Air Force
plane. “No information is available”
was the answer he got. Again and
again, in answer to questions, the re-
peated reply was that records were not
kept.
The affair started to become serious
when the Prime Minister backed down
and admitted that, yes, he could pro-
duce cost figures after all. But the
explosion came when the ALP, with
the support of the DLP and Govern-
ment rebels in the Senate, threatened
to call the Secretary of the Air Depart-
ment to the bar of the Senate to
answer questions. It was then that Sen-
ate Government leader John Gorton,
who all along had been privately say-
ing that evasion was dangerous, insisted
that the Government should come
clean. He got the Air Department
to give him the record books and
papers, mentioned this, in passing, to
the Prime Minister, and took them im-
mediately to the Senate, where he
tabled them. In the flurry no one
thought to stop one of Senator Gorton’s
ministerial colleagues from reaffirming
for the umpteenth time that there were
no records.
The ruckus was on. Labor motions
of no confidence and further moves to
bring the Air Secretary (in the absence
of the Minister) to the Senate were de-
feated by the DLP. But since the DLP
was agreeable to the proposal to recon-
vene Parliament to hear Mr. Howson
on his return from Africa, the Prime
Minister was forced to reconvene the
House of Representatives this week.
Complete confusion
In the middle of this melodrama the
Government got itself into another
tangle. Its flow of Bills into Parliament,
too late and large anyway to get com-
fortably through even a quiet session,
was completely disrupted by the VIP
aircraft affair. This, plus the large
number of visiting VIPs from over-
seas, also slowed down Cabinet work
and, with the election coming on, the
Government rushed to announce a
whole series of decisions. It whipped
through the resignation of Dr. Coombs
from the Reserve Bank, and appointed
him as the head of two new institu-
tions: the Council for Aboriginal Affairs
and the Arts Council of Australia.
At the same time it announced that,
after all, it-had decided to develop the
North by supporting the Ord River
Scheme, the second stage of which it
had decided against last year. It
excused this change of plan by an-
nouncing that there were new figures
to reverse its earlier negative conclu-
sions on the profitability of the scheme.
There was complete confusion among
Cabinet Ministers about what the Gov-
The return of Mr. Howson
ernment was up to with development.
The Minister for National Develop-
ment, Mr. Fairbairn, seemed to be
batting all right when he announced
the Government’s decision In the House
of Representatives at afternoon-tea time
last Wednesday. But Mr. Fairbairn
didn’t seem to have passed on the
scheme to his fellow Cabinet Minister
Senator Henty.
When the Senate got around to
questions, after afternoon-tea time,.
Labor’s Senator Tangney asked Senator
Henty what the Government was doing
about the Ord Scheme. Apparently not
knowing what Mr. Fairbairn had
already said in the House of Repre-
sentatives, Senator Henty said: “I do
not know what the present position is,
but if the Senator puts her question on
the notice paper I will see what the
Minister for National Development can
tell me about the stage that has been
reached in the Government’s considera-
tion of the second phase of the project.”
Further grist for the mill, admit-
tedly of poorer quality, came two ques-
tions later when Senator Gorton was
asked by Senator Ken Morris (Lib.,
Qld.) whether the Government had yet
made a decision about the Emerald
Irrigation Scheme. Gorton promptly
delivered a lecture in
parliamentary procedure
on questions of policy.
“The Honorable Senator
would not expect to
receive an answer on a
matter of policy at Ques-
tion Time,” he told
Morris. Yet if Morris had
bothered to wander up to
the House of Represen-
tatives an hour earlier he
would have heard the
Government’s announce-
ment that the scheme had
the “green light.”
The decision on the
Emerald Irrigation
Scheme seemed an even
more blatant election item
than the Ord Scheme
announcement, since the
Emerald Scheme had
been specified by the
Bureau of Agricultural
Economics as a particu-
larly . unworthy scheme
when investigated several
years ago. Again the
Government did not table
any estimates of expected
costs and benefits.
Vietnam overtones
Parliament assumed a
more statesipanlike look
when it got on to the


foreign affairs debate, but here, too, of
course, the Senate elections provided
an overtone. For party advantage the
debate was shifted from Tuesday to
Thursday to get it away from news-
paper reports of the VIP aircraft fuss,
and there was enacted on Thursday
some of the general manoeuvring on
Vietnam that will be a characteristic
of the Senate campaign, with the Gov-
ernment parties divided as to how to
handle it, and the Labor Party shooting
off in two different directions.
The Vietnam debate centred on
the Government’s additional troop
commitment and an unusually solid
speech by External Affairs Minister
Hasluck.
He spoke strongly against a bombing
pause: “Back here at home a pause
may soothe the feelings of those who
abhor suffering; up there in Vietnam
it means more munitions, more weap-
ons, and a restored military advantage
to the enemy to endanger our own
soldiers and to augment terror and
assassination in the countryside.” Saying
that the North Vietnamese were losing,
he went on: “North Vietnam is paying
a tremendous price for its aggression,
yet has nothing to show in return.” But,
encouraged by protest in the West, the
North appeared for the moment deter-
mined to force “a military solution.”
Mr. Hasluck concluded: “It is a sad
paradox today that the placards hoisted
in the name of peace are encouraging a
continuation of the war.”
At the time of the troop-increase
announcement, Mr. Whitlam had dis-
mayed his supporters by evading de-
bate, but he was well prepared in his
reply to Hasluck. For a very full 46
minutes he darted at the Government
with his sharp lawyer’s tongue. He
started the war of respectable quota-
tions. Everyone from archbishops to
U Thant, from Bobby Kennedy to Dick
Nixon, from the Army Secretary to the
President of the RSL was called in as
a Vietnam expert not to mention US
Defence Secretary McNamara, who
was mentioned no less than eight times.
He hammered the Government for its
attempt to say there were only two
choices in Vietnam: total war or total
withdrawal. But he failed (though his
deputy, Barnard, came good on this) to
spell out his own policy, a point the
Prime Minister came powerfully back
with. With that liking for the 19th-
century style that still marks parlia-
mentary debate, he called Whitlam an
“artful dodger.”
After that the debate faded badly,
but there was interest when Dr. Cairns,
unorthodox as usual, said that there
were “grave and dangerous conse-
quences in winning the war,” and we
should, therefore, not try.
Mr. McEwen battled the insurance
policy argument; Mr. Barnard effec-
tively demonstrated that Americans
were often too optimistic.
Mr. McMahon threw in some figures
showing the progress in pacification,
but he seemed less at home with these
than with his Treasury statistics. Man-
fred Cross, after “the late” Sam Ben-
son, the ALP’s man most sympathetic
to Western policy, made a moderate
if unremarkable speech, and Defence
Minister Fairhall said nothing except
that propaganda was the essence of the
struggle.
Bad luck in the draw
Meanwhile it looked as if the results
of the Senate election might already
be settled. With the luck of the draw
running against him, Mr. Holt must
have all but given up hope of winning
a ruling majority of seats when he
learned that his party had won number
one position on the Senate ballot papers
in only one State, Victoria, and this
in a State where no help was needed.
In New South Wales, Tasmania, and
Queensland . the Liberals have been
allocated number three position, whilst
in South Australia and Western Aus-
tralia they have drawn the extreme out-
side. From these positions the Prime
Minister will have to put up a Tobin
Bronze performance to win the required
majority.
In any case the post-Calwell swing
provided danger signs for the Govern-
ment in the loss of the Corio and
Capricornia by-elections and in the
drop in popularity recorded in the latest
Gallup poll. On the other hand there
is comfort in the continuing support
of the public for the Vietnam military
commitment and the various contradic-
tory foreign policies of branches of
the Labor Party. Mr. Holt’s best hope
is that Mr. Calwell and the Vietniks
will enter the campaign and allow him
to exact maximum benefit from Labor’s
most obvious weakness.
To gain control of the Senate the
Liberal Party needs to win three out
of five seats in at least five States. The
ALP, which has drawn number one
position in New South. Wales and
South Australia, is similarly placed. Its
best hopes of extra seats lie in New
South Wales, where Mr. Whitlam’s per-
sonal appeal is at its greatest, and
Queensland, where its candidates are
second on the list. The DLP has won
top position in three States and this
gives it a reasonable chance of send-
ing colleagues to join Senators Mc-
Manus and Gair from Queensland and
Western Australia. There is also some
hope for the number one DLP candi-
date, Mr. Jack Kane, in N.S.W.
In the likely event of a stalemate the
man with most to .gain could be Senator
Gorton. Lacking a majority, opposed
to astute ALP and DLP tacticians, and
with unruly backbenchers in his own
Party, Senator Gorton has the chance
to reveal his parliamentary and political
abilities. It is an open secret that
Liberal Party machine leaders are dis-
appointed with the performance of Mr.
Holt.
Souvanna Phouma
Victory matters
FOR THE FOURTH time in a few
\Veeks, Department of the Interior
garden trucks rumbled up to Parlia-
ment House in Canberra and labori-
ously unloaded three dozen long white
flagpoles. From them were draped,
next to Australian flags, the handsome
red-and-white flags of Laos. And out
of the basement once again came the
red carpet: “The silverfish are getting
hell these days,” said an attendant.
Up the carpet came the veteran
leader from the small landlocked
country next door to Vietnam: Prime
Minister Souvanna Phouma. He
talked privately with Mr. Holt and
the Foreign Affairs Committee of the
Cabinet, telling them that his armed
forces could handle the indigenous
Laotian Communists and that for the
time being at least the 40,000 North
Vietnamese troops on his soil are busy
with the war in Vietnam, not
troubling him overmuch.
He wants the fighting kept as much
out of his country as possible, and he
understandably is not keen on pro-
posals for extending the McNamara
Barrier from the DMZ in Vietnam
through into Laos to cut the Ho Chi
Minh trails. But he recognises the
paramount importance of victory in
Vietnam and will turn a blind eye to
harassment both by stepped-up
bombing and by guerilla units on the
ground—against the North Vietnamese
trails.
Souvanna Phouma in Sydney


To the Parliament at a luncheon
in his honor, he traced the history of
Lis country, of its “forgotten war” and
the vain attempts to make a coalition
.•government with the Communists work.
.Not only was his country occupied by
40,000 North Vietnamese troops but the
Lao Communists were “armed, paid,
trained, and encadred by North
Vietnam.” He ended, discarding his
notes, with the plea: “We count on
you and your assistance to help us to
survive ... we don’t want Communists
in our country.”
He must have been as surprised as
most of the parliamentarians and
journalists present at the lavish praise
heaped on him by Opposition Leader
Gough Whitlam: “An absolutely out-
standing Asian leader, a patriot from
the beginning, who had never ceased to
fight for the independence of his
people.” Moreover, he was a man who
“had stuck to Lis guns,” not something
the Labor Party often suggests these
days to peopie under Communist
attack.
The following Prime Minister’s Press
Conference at a local hotel was almost
disrupted by an argument between the
hotel manager and a TV director over
whether the pub should get free pub-
licity through a sign that had been
positioned behind the PM’s seat. “Why
should you get $BOOO worth of free
publicity?” he was being asked as the
Laotian PM and his party walked out.
“The Pathet Lao and North Viet-
namese say they are conducting a war
of liberation against us. What are they
liberating us from? We are independent
already. I have sufficiently displayed
my neutrality,” Souvanna Phouma had
said, and went on to explain that his
first requests for military assistance to
counter the Pathet Lao assault of 1965
had been to the Soviet Union.
Souvanna Phouma takes some com-
fort from the fact that the North Viet-
namese deny the presence of their
troops in his country and so in diplo-
matic terms at least continue to re-
spect his nation’s sovereignty and the
letter of the Geneva Accords. “We
have refrained, in the Laotian phrase,
from putting our hand into the hornets’
:nest.”
But asked what would happen if the
hornets came anyway he said: “I put
all my hopes on the Great Powers which
Lave guaranteed our independence. It
is for them to come to the support of
our neutrality.” Which seemed to sug-
gest that if the North Vietnamese de-
ode to bring matters to the crunch in
Laos there would be no hesitation in
calling for American assistance.
Of Vietnam he said that now the
South is sufficiently strong to deal with
Insurgency, but not with North Viet-
namese forces as well. “The American
troops cannot withdraw from South
Vietnam unless the North Vietnamese
troops do the same. If the Americans
and their allies were to withdraw to-
day, the only thing left for us to do
would be to pack up our bags and
go-”
The ACTU
A new hat in the ring?
SINCE The Bulletin’s last report on
the Left-Moderates’ struggle within the
ACTU, with the succession to Mr.
Albert Monk’s presidency possibly de-
pendent on it, there has been an inter-
state executive meeting, and a dead-
lock. The meeting was called to elect
a senior vice-president to replace the
late Jim Kenny, secretary of the N.S.W.
Trades and Labor Council, but after a
series of complicated manoeuvres in
Melbourne last week the Left and
Moderates were deadlocked, eight-all,
and a telegraphic vote will need to be
held after nominations close on Novem-
her 30.
The overall strategy of the Left Wing
and pro-Communists on the executive
was to appoint the present junior vice-
president of the ACTU, Mr. J. Petrie,
to the senior position and elect the
federal secretary of the Electrical
Trades Union, Mr. C. Dolan, to fill the
junior vice-presidency. Such a result
would have increased the prestige of
Hawke...second thoughts
Fitzgibbon...alternative
the Left and, more importantly, given
it a majority of one on the executive.
The Moderates and anti-Communists,
led by ACTU secretary Mr. Harold
Souter, would prefer the man who suc-
ceeded Mr. Kenny on the N.S.W.
Trades and Labor Council, Mr. R.
Marsh, for the senior vice-presidency.
Such a result would automatically bring
Mr. J. Ducker, assistant secretary in
N.S.W. to Marsh, on to the ACTU
executive. The Moderates would then
be in a majority of one, on paper at
least.
If Petrie wins the senior vice-presi-
dency from his likely rival candidate,
Marsh, it is then likely that Marsh and
Dolan will contest the junior position
at a further ballot.
The estimates of forces are, however,
complicated by the fact that Albert
Monk is at present being classified as,
and voting with, the Moderates. These
are not positions Mr. Monk usually
likes. In the past he has shown a strong
inclination to work for a position where
the numbers of the contending forces
are fairly even and he holds the bal-
ance of power.
I n the event of Ducker being brought
on to the council the voting would be
eight-all, with Monk holding the de-
ciding vote of the 17-man executive.
On the present 16-man executive, Monk
} s not a bl e to freely manoeuvre and
bestow his favors in the way he likes,
A Petrie-Dolan result would give the
Left control of the council, but a
Marsh-Ducker victory would not be so
much a victory for the anti-Commu-
nists as a chance for Monk to increase
his independence and powers of patron-
age.
Behind the Left-Right clashes and
Monk’s quest for the decisive vote lies
the problem of the future leadership of
the ACTU. In the event of the presi-
dent’s death or retirement (and he is
now officially 67) it is generally agreed
that the battle for succession would be
between secretary Souter and ACTU
research officer and industrial advocate
Bob Hawke, who has strong Left-wing
backing.
At the moment Hawke is the ruling
favorite for the job, but there are signs
that he could run into trouble. Monk,
for example, has lately shown signs of
some disaffection with his research
officer.
In addition, some of the Left-wing
unions are beginning to have a second
look at Hawke, who, despite his Left-
wing backing, is without ideological
commitments to the Left, and is more
interested in union efficiency and eco-
nomic results than political faction-

fights. The name of Mr. C. H. Fitz-
gibbon, general secretary of the Water-
side Workers’ Federation, is being can-
vassed in Communist circles as a pos-
sible alternative to Hawke. Fitzgibbon’s
aggressive attitude at last week’s ACTU
meeting may have been partly designed
to encourage such speculation.
Wool
Second go round
HERE WAS THE Australian wool in-
dustry beset with one great problem
the cost-price squeeze and a num-
ber of other important problems. Its
“parliament,” the Australian Wool In-
dustry Conference, met last week and
concerned itself not with the cost-price
squeeze, nor with the other important
problems, but with a special obsession
of its own: the smoothing out of fluc-
tuations in the sale of small lots of
wool, a modification of a proposal that
had already been defeated by the
growers.
In its second go round the Australian
Wool Board, in its report to the con-
ference, put up a recommendation, with
two members dissenting, that a statu-
tory authority should be set up to
acquire lots of less than four bales.
This authority would buy when it be-
lieved prices were too low and sell
when prices went up again, paying
growers an average price on its trans-
actions. The Wool Board report said:
“There appears to be no solution to the
problem of short-term price fluctua-
tions that 'arise under the auction sys-
tem unless some attempt is made to
regulate the supply of wool to the de-
mand for it.”
What this meant was that the reserve
price scheme was being put up all over
again in a modified form, although it
had already been rejected by the
growers in a referendum two years ago
and has since proved to be unsatisfac-
tory in New Zealand and has recently
been attacked by some of the main
international buyers. The puzzle as to
why the Wool Board is boiling its cab-
bages twice increases when it is con-
sidered how unlikely it is that the
Government will call another referen-
dum on much the same issue.
Why this conservatism? The answer
lies in wool politics and Country Party
politics more generally. When the Wool
Board succeeded in increasing expendi-
ture on wool promotion there were
cries of anguish from many of the small
woolgrowers, many of whom mix wool-
growing with other farming and look
on the industry quite differently from
the main woolgrowers. In their other
farming activities they are used to
marketing plans, and they wanted a
marketing plan for the wool industry,
too. From these pressures the proposal
of a reserve price scheme first gener-
ated. To some of the wool politicians,
although, with the stubborness of the
defeated, they still really believe in a
reserve price scheme, it also seems
necessary to keep the pot boiling so
that the small growers don’t turn on
the Wool Board’s promotion plans and
perhaps on the very existence of the
Board itself.
Aboriginal reserves
Missions to quit
“ABORIGINES SHOULD reap some
benefits from Australia’s development,”
the Rev. Mr. F. G. Engel, spokesman
for the Australian Council of Churches,
told The Bulletin when we asked him
why his council had decided to hand
over its missions to government con-
trol. He said that his council would
attempt to persuade the State and
Federal Governments to award the
Aborigines legal ownership of their re-
serves, including mineral rights and
local self-government. Representatives
of the Catholic Church and the United
Aborigines Mission, the two major
groups with Aboriginal missions not
Minister Barnes ... staffing problems
included in the Council of Churches,
said the statement was news to them.
Mr. Engel said that there was no im-
mediate crisis, but that they had
accumulated a growing number of prob-
lems for Aboriginal missions over recent
years. Two years ago the Council had
discussed with the Minister for Ter-
ritories (Mr. Barnes) the staffing prob-
lems of its 42 missions scattered over
the Northern Territory, South Aus-
tralia, Queensland, and Western Aus-
tralia, which provide all the material
as well as the spiritual sustenance for
about 12,000 Aborigines. The missions
have become towns, and it has fallen
to the missionaries’ lot to look after the
airstrip or kerb the roads, normally the
job of a town council. “We might em-
ploy 50 people for missionary work,
and more than that for this other work.

Although things are not at boiling point,
it involves us in a considerable amount
of administrative work.”
In line with this policy the Pres-
byterians have since handed over their
Weipa mission and the Anglicans their
Edward River, Lockhart River, and
Mitchell River stations to State Govern-
ments. Last week in a widely cir-
culated pamphlet the Council of
Churches set out a long-term policy
which will eventually involve a sub-
stantial cut in its present 406 mission-
aries. At least one missionary stays
on as a chaplain to the former mis-
sion, and where necessary they continue
as teachers or medical officers.
“The pamphlet,” Mr. Engel con-
tinued, “was also a plug for land
rights. The reserves are not Aboriginal
land and can be unreserved at any time
by proclamation. Over the past 20
years there has been a good deal of
eating into reserve land; for instance, at
Weipa, in Queensland, and Gove, in
Arnhem Land. The authorities are
under continual pressure from mining
concerns. We are not blocking progress,
but feel that the Aboriginal should
share it. Our parallel is the way the
United States Government has allowed
the Red Indians land and mineral rights
and given them legal and technical
advice.”
What success so far? In 1965 the
Council of Churches issued a brochure
on the land rights of the Aboriginal,
and shortly after that the matter was
taken up by the South Australian
Government. The brochure was cir-
culated widely during the debate in
Parliament. The result was the setting
up of the Aboriginal Land Trust. It
was a major breakthrough, but has not
yet been emulated by any other State.
The kind of direct success the Coun-
cil of Churches seeks is the mining lease
the Anglican Church Missionary Society
obtained a few years ago. As a result
of this and the enlightened policy of the
Broken Hill Proprietary Company, the
Aborigines at Groote Eylandt have
moved successfully from the mission
situation into industrial conditions. So
far the success is small, but the deter-
mination has now been declared for a
quite acceptable interference of Church
in State affairs.
Immigrants
Second chance
ONE SUGGESTION largely over-
looked in comment on the report of
the Immigration Advisory Council’s
Committee of Social Patterns (chair-
man, Mr. Justice W. R. Dovey) offered
Australia a way of increasing its per-
manent intake of British immigrants—
by giving those who had returned a
second chance.
The Dovey report advocated two ex-
ceptions to the general international
rule of “no second chance”: that child-
ren who left with returning parents
before the age of 18 could fairly be
offered second assisted passages; and
so might those of any age who had
repaid their first assistance and de-
parted with the intention of settling
permanently elsewhere. Toward an
estimate of the numbers who might
be recovered this way, it was noted
that, despite general knowledge of the
“no second chance” policy, 900 second-
assistance inquiries were recorded in
London during the first quarter of
1967.
On the evidence “there could be
some thousands of potential re-emi-
grants should second assistance, be
made available.”
The Dovey Committee looked hard at
all the reasons that might be against its
Dovey...shock of discovery
idea (exploitation by some migrants
and the fact that many second-timers
could fail were two of them), noted
the difficulty there would be in work-
ing out criteria for granting or refus-
ing second assistance, and all but ended
with “it’s worth it, let’s give it a go.”
The committee seems to have found
that reasons for whole families return-
ing to Britain defy concrete analysis
or docketing. “Psychological unpre-
paredness” among British migrants in
particular was stressed, along with the
fact that “an apparent similarity of
institutions, customs, and habits . . .
served only to conceal the real gulf . . .
and intensify the shock of discovery”
that the Australian 'way of life was
radically different from the British.
So another of its recommendations
was for better counselling in London
(including use of more women coun-
sellors to advise women) to prevent
that shock becoming traumatic and giv-
ing immigrants a desire to return
home quickly, usually within the first
six months. To this end it suggests fol-
low-ups through all-States Citizens
Advice Bureau to be publicised in the
foreign-language Press as well.
Finally, the committee wants more
stress in public and even in the schools
on the importance of migration. Aus-
tralians, it says, seem almost uncon-
scious of it, and migrants find this in-
difference hard to take or understand.




How we could raise 100,000 soldiers
By PETER SAMUEL
WHEN THE BRITISH announced the
timetable for their pull-out from
Malaysia and Singapore, the Australian
Government did a most unusual thing.
It set up a sub-committee of Cabinet to
try to work out an overall foreign and
defence policy for Australia. This heady
intellectual exercise did not last for
long. There were a series of interrup-
tions—by-elections, overseas trips, visit-
ing VIPs, the usual parliamentary busi-
ness, the Senate election campaign—
and, for the time being, the Government
has given up its review. The decision to
send extra troops to Vietnam is all that
has come out of it so far. However,
thinking will be resumed in December,
when there is to be a Vietnam Allies
summit meeting in Seoul and early in
the New Year there will probably be
Malaysia - Singapore - Britain-Australia-
New Zealand talks on the British with-
drawal. After that the Government will
put up a three-year defence program to
operate from July, 1968.
The general line of the Government’s
thinking already seems predictable. For
one thing there is no possibility that the
Government will adopt a “Fortress Aus-
tralia” policy, involving an abandon-
ment of “Forward Defence.” This line
has floated around sections of some of
the Government departments from
Treasury officials afraid of the mount-
ing costs of even our present minimal
involvement in Asia, from sceptics in
External Affairs who see the Americans
bowing to domestic pressures to quit
Asia and return to a fortress of their
own, and from service people who are
acutely aware of the limited strength
of our present military forces. As a
direct policy of withdrawal it is cf no
•significance, but as a kind of indirect
pressure it is of some importance since
it acts as a brake on schemes to make
our involvement in Asia more signifi-
cant.
Our defence policies look like being
based on two concepts —the American
alliance and co-operation with the coun-
tries of South-East Asia. The American
alliance demands as an absolute mini-
mum that we maintain at least our
present commitment of a brigade group
in Vietnam and that we should make
proportional contributions in response
to similar challenges elsewhere.
Regional co-operation requires a more
diffuse effort, bilaterally and multi-
laterally, with our neighbors. The
American alliance is the politicians’
favorite statement for the basis of our
defence policy, since it is an obviously
salable electoral proposition to be able
to talk of being protected by the
strongest nation on earth. To talk con-
vincingly of defence based on co-
operation with a variety of smaller,
underdeveloped nations of different cul-
tures and differing degrees of political
stability is more difficult.
Yet the programs to be followed, the
diplomatic initiatives required, the
forces to be raised and their deploy-
ment are essentially similar whichever
is the predominant basis for our defence.
The Americans in the future, as Johnson
has been saying subtly in various
speeches and as his Republican rival
Nixon has said bluntly in his article
in The Bulletin, will place no value on
an alliance of the old sort. They will
only value an alliance with Australia if
that alliance leads us to taking greater
initiatives in leadership for the defence
of our region. Americans of all political
persuasions want to reduce the direct
role of the U.S. in the defence of Asia,
and a corollary of this is that they
want the local Big Powers, especially
Japan and Australia, to start to take
initiatives and to assume a bigger bur-
den. Nothing, in fact, would strengthen
the Australian-American alliance more
effectively than some purposeful Aus-
tralian activity to weld a South-East
Asian region closer to being capable
of self-defence.
The old subservient interpretation of
the American alliance has been epito-
mised in Mr. Harold Holt’s “All the
way with LBJ” and Mr. William
McMahon’s more recent “Where you
go, we will go, too.” But in the context
of a developing political climate in
America, which will not support large-
scale unilateral commitments, that sort
of posture simply won’t buy an Ameri-
can alliance in the years ahead. A
policy of active leadership and taking
a greater share of the overall burden
of the defence of South-East Asia is the
only option available to us.
Invasion isn’t something we have to
be concerned about, at least looking
ten years hence, since there is no one
around with the capacity to try it.
Bombing of our cities is only a very re-
mote contingency, especially since the
Sukarnoists were overthrown in Indo-
nesia, and, anyway, our Mirage inter-
ceptors and the deterrent capability of
the Fills when they arrive will be
ample to cope with any bombing threats
which might arise within the foreseeable
future. As for China’s nuclear missile
capacity, due to loom up about 1972,
we will be relying principally on the
Americans for protection, though it
would seem a wise precaution to at
The Australian Army is under-
equipped. in transport planes, heli-
copters, artillery, and men
least be in a position to manufacture
our own bomb at short notice. Two
medium-sized nuclear power stations
would provide this potential. For a
State like South Australia, with very
expensive conventional power, they
would make sense as a simple economic
proposition as sources of electricity.
The main defence contingencies in the
kind of future we can immediately
plan for are those connected with che
need to deal with insurgency, supple-
mented by selective and escalating ex-
ternal support. Yet at present there are
two ways in which our armed forces
are not good enough for this job.
In the first place, they are severely
underequipped by modern standards.
Although our Army is now designed so
that it is airportable, we simply do not
have the aircraft to transport more than
about a company of it at a time. Apart
from the Qantas fleet we do not have
enough big transport planes to get them
into the war theatre quickly, and once
there we do not have the helicopters
to engage in heliborne assaults or to
move artillery. To give an idea of oui
requirement, an American brigade of
the size of our Task Force in Vietnam
is equipped with between 100 and 150
Iroquois assault helicopters and TO to
20 twin-rotor heavylift choppers. Our
Vietnam force has nine Iroquois ana
will be soon getting another eight. We
have no heavylift craft. And, although
in Vietnam almost a quarter of enemy
casualties are inflicted by helicoptei
“gunships,” designed specifically for an-
to-ground fire-support, we do not have
any of these. Nor do we have the lig t
artillery. Our operations in Vietnam
would be far more difficult if it vve * e
not for the cover provided with t e
American heavy artillery—l7smm. guns
with a range of 20 miles, three times
that of the 105 mm. guns which are the
sole armament of our artillery regiment.
The other deficiency is a simple lack
of numbers. We just don’t have enough
ground troops to be able to carry much
weight in South-East Asia. Our army
of 43,000 men has gone about as far
as it can go. The best it can do is to
provide a brigade-sized task force of
about 7000. Such a force has a capacity
for intensive pacification and defence of
an area about 25 miles by 20 miles,
containing by average South-East Asian
density a population of 40,000 to
100,000. This is the sort of control that
our force in Vietnam in Phuoc Tuy
province is able to achieve. Of course,
if its role was limited to the task most
American units in Vietnam perform,
achieving general military dominance
while leaving anti-guerilla work to indi-
genous forces, or if it was operating
in more sparsely populated areas, then
its area of influence would be three or
four times as large. It would be able
to exert influence over, perhaps, as
much as 2000 square miles.
This military capacity is not worth-
less, or utterly insignificant, as some
Australian critics are apt to say. It is
equivalent to perhaps one-thirtieth of
what the Americans are doing in South
Vietnam on current commitments of
troops. It is about one-sixth of what
the Koreans are doing there. The
Americans have ten divisions in Viet-
nam, the Koreans two. But it is argu-
able that if we are to be a significant
influence in the region then we should
be thinking in terms of almost trebling
our Army capacity within a period of
ten years or so.
Such a force would be both signifi-
cant and feasible. In the present quasi-
war situation in which National Service
ls selective and regular soldiers are not
expected to serve more than one year
in three in a war-zone, such an army
would be able to sustain in operation
three brigade-sized task forces. These
could be deployed as self-contained
units or combined into a division-sized
organisation of over 20,000 men. Such
a force would enable us to make a
troop commitment equal to that the
Americans are currently making in
Vietnam, in terms of our population in
relation to theirs. It would be a force
quite close in size to that the British
deployed successfully against Indonesia
during Confrontation. Further, for
purposes of assessing its strength, we
might estimate that, if deployed in a
country like Thailand, it would add
about 50 percent to the strength of
that country’s armed forces. It could
help the Philippines similarly, or more
than double the force at the disposal
of the Government in Kuala Lumpur.
Should conventional war break out and
the rules of one-year-in-three-in-combat
be abandoned, all three divisions would
be available for action, a very substan-
tial force by any standard (though not
huge by World War II standards, at
the peak of which Australia fielded
12 divisions).
Such a build-up could not be as
simply achieved as the recent expan-
sion of the Army, though numerically
it would be no faster. In terms of men
it would not be difficult: the required
average annual expansion of the army
of 6500 would take only one of the
20 extra people entering the workforce
each year, a proportion which would
not upset civilian life. And in terms
of money it would involve no great
upset: even if a trebled Army cost
five times as much now (s2ooom. as
compared with $400m.) it would have
no drastic effect on economic growth or
standards of living, as these figures
show:

As the table shows, even assuming a
doubling in the average cost of a
soldier and in the cost of Army equip-
ment and allowing the Air Force and
Navy to continue to grow in propor-
tion to the economy generally, only
s2ooom. of the extra $15,000m. of the
likely increase in the economy would be
absorbed by defence: that is, 7.5 percent
of the total likely increase in Aus-
tralian production. At the end of the
period defence would absorb about 8.5
percent of our national energies as com-
pared with 5.0 percent at present. In
other words, by 1977 we would be
spending proportionally the same
amount on defence as the Americans
are now. Defence would cost us $2OO
per person each year, as compared to
$B5 at present, but per capita incomes
would have risen from $1650 to $2300
a year.
Such an increase would be rather
similar in scale to a continuation of the
defence build-up of 1965 and 1966, as'


these figures concerned only with the
Regular Army show:

1975 88,000 6000
1976 94,000 6000
1977 100,000 6000
The main problems in assembling a
force of this sort would not be budgetary
or economic, and there would be no
great drain on the workforce, which is
due on most projections to rise by at
least 130,000 a year. The overriding
difficulty would be in providing the
training cadres of leadership—the offi-
cers and NCOs. An Army force of
100,000 would require something like
60,000 permanents, with only 40,000 of
the total strength being supplied by the
two-year National Service scheme. The
increase in National Service for such
an expansion would not have to be
particularly steep —in 1977 the average
chance of being called up would only
be about fifty percent greater than now.
But the next three years are likely
to be very sparse ones for the Army in
terms of additional officers and NCOs.
Both 1969 and 1970 will see very large
numbers retiring, because a large crop
of World War II officers and 1948
NCOs will have reached the end of
their careers. Given present numbers in
training, these retirements will only just
Payday in Vietnam last week...“in-
centives to voluntary enlistment must
be improved”
be offset by new graduates. The officer
corps as a whole is likely to remain
constant in size, the Army estimates.
Unless . . .
Unless Army officers can be recruited
from elsewhere, and this is where the
British defence cuts may have their
benefit for us. At its present strength
the Army is 600 short of its establish-
ment of 1750 captains and almost 200
short of its establishment of 1250
majors. (A surplus of 100 lieutenants
will, if a good proportion of National
Service officers re-enlist, ease the situa-
tion a little as they get promotions. But
there will sfill be a sizable gap to be
filled.) The Army is hoping to get 300
captains and majors as a result of British
demobilisation between 1968 and 1972,
but our own officer corps will not start
to increase significantly until 1971 on
present estimates. Then it will only
increase by about 100 a year, only suffi-
cient to sustain a two percent per
annum increase in the Army.
All this is based on the Army’s cur-
rent modest plans in which the period
of rapid expansion is something of the
past. A decision now to embark on
continued expansion along the hypo-
thetical lines suggested here would, in
the opinion of Army people, still be
possible, though there would be severe
strains, even if special efforts were
made. For one thing, there would have
to be a drive to get even more than the
targeted 300 British officers between
now and 1972. The target for re-enlist-
ment of National Service officers would
have to be raised. At present it is five
percent of the 250 produced each year.
Officers generally are expected to serve
in the Army for a minimum of 25 years,
but some scheme whereby National
Service officers could elect to serve
for an additional three or five years
might well go a good distance
to overcoming the Army’s critical
shortage of captains and majors. If 20
percent elected to stay on under such
a scheme as opposed to the five percent
expected to re-enlist as permanents, the
Army would have another 200 middle-
level officers by 1972. Alternatively, or
for that matter additionally, it might
be possible to require officers recruited
through National Service to serve three
years rather than two to allow them to
filter up into the sparse captain ranks.
But in any case there would be no
alternative to providing more induce-
ments to voluntary enlistment. Basic
rates of pay are already quite good (a
major at 30 earns $6500), but they
might have to be raised further and
more frequently adjusted to rises in
wages in the community generally.
Housing for married servicemen is a
major difficulty at present, with a wait-
ing list of about 3000. At present rates
of building it will take four years to
satisfy this need, and any additional
expansion of the armed forces would
obviously add to the waiting list.
Another great grudge in the services
is against the pension scheme, or the
Defence Forces Retirement Benefit
Fund. “It’s a hoax and a waste of public
money . . . the Government has the
idea that a bird in the hand is worth
two in the bush. I agree that DFRB
‘is for the birds,’ ” said Sergeant A. J.
Hogan in the Army newspaper earlier
this year. “Ask any serving soldier
what he thinks of the scheme he is
forced to be a part of,” he challenged
the authorities. By the standards of
most superannuation schemes it is, in
fact, extraordinarily good. As well as
providing benefits for widows and chil-
dren in the case of death, and an in-
validity pension in the case of injuries
through any cause,, the cash pension on
discharge from the Army is made up by
a $3.50 Commonwealth contribution
for every $1 produced by the service-
men’s contribution. The Public Service
scheme is less generous with a $2.50 to
$1 employer contribution and, of
course, most private schemes operate
$ for $. The Government would elimin-
ate a lot of discontent if it were to pay
the whole expense of the scheme, mak-
ing it completely non-contributory, a
move which would cost it sllm. at
present rates, though a figure which
would rise rapidly to s2om.
A less expensive alternative would be
for the Army to make a real effort to
explain to servicemen that the scheme
is worth while. At present there is not
even a single brochure available, though
at least one is in course of preparation.
But the old attitude toward the
serviceman—that he simply has to lump
it, and is too stupid to understand any-
way—dies hard.
Even with an army of 100,000, the-
National Service scheme would remain
highly 'Selective, with only a propor-
tion of men turning 20 being called
up. These men drafted in a time of
peace at home, their lives and careers
interrupted at a crucial stage, and
asked to take great personal risks,
deserve a really generous deal. As well
as being allowed to benefit from raised
pay scales (designed primarily to in-
crease voluntary enlistments), they
could be given larger benefits on dis-
charge. The war service housing loan
of $BOOO could, for instance, sensibly
be enlarged to $12,000.
What of the CMF? In its present
form it seems of very little use as a
fighting force. It is not being used
to take any burden off the Regular
indeed it is a strain on it,
through tying up about 1100 of its
officers and men. In its present state
of readiness it would be of little use
in an emergency since it would take
at least six months to mobilise. Not
that it is costing terribly much
s36m. But that is rather a high price
to pay for maintaining the tradition
of a citizen army and making possible
part-time military service. If the CMF
is to have a useful role, in an age
of quasi-war, then it will have to be
used some way. It might prove
feasible to insist on higher standards
in the CMF and to attach CMF bat-
talions to a Vietnam Task Force for
periods of four or six months. Other-
wise, it is likely to be increasingly
regarded as a haven for draft-dodgers,
a general burden on the system.


How do you fight
Shirley Temple?
By JULIUS DUSCHA
Shirley Temple Black and her husband... political ambition as hard to combat as her record on the Good Ship Lollypop
LOVABLE LITTLE Shirley Temple
running for Congress? Certainly not!
The Shirley Temple Black campaign-
ing in affluent San Mateo County down
the peninsula from San Francisco is
a coolly controlled, sometimes steely-
eyed, candidate. In a rather hard voice
she sticks to a conservative Republican
script calculated to exploit the wide-
spread apprehensions about Vietnam,
riots, taxes, and morality. Never is she
rattled. And never does she present
herself as a grown-up child actress at
sea in the real world.
This is not to say that the name and
pleasant memories of Shirley Temple,
one of the most popular movie moppets
of all time, are not the candidate’s
chief assets. Mrs. Black changed her
voter registration from Shirley J. Black
to Shirley Temple Black so that her
all-important maiden name would
appear on the ballot. The campaign
literature and the bumper stickers read
“Shirley Temple Black,” while the
buttons merely say “Shirley.” And at
the age of 39 Mrs. Black still has that
instantly recognised baby face of 35
movies and 40 television shows. “Jesus
Christ!” exclaimed one startled woman
on whose doorstep she appeared. “It’s
you!”
But behind the name and the face
is a tough-minded, determined woman
who listens to the advice of the pro-
fessionals running her campaign, but
makes her own decisions. Mrs. Black’s
driving ambition to be a Congress-
woman has proved to be almost as
difficult for her opponents to combat
as her service record on the Good Ship
Lollipop. She is the favorite in the
crowded field of ten candidates seek-
ing to succeed the conservative Repub-
lican Representative J. Arthur Younger,
who died last June. Under California
law, all candidates run on a single
ballot in a special election of this kind,
If no one receives a majority in the
November 14 voting, a runoff between
the Republican and Democrat with the
highest number of votes will be held
on December 12.
Most of San Mateo County is an
idyllic suburbia on the San Francisco
Peninsula. The cities strung along
the Bayshore Freeway and the South-
ern Pacific commuter line include
aristocratic Atherton and benign
Burlingame as well as hustling Red-
wood City and middle-class San
Mateo. A few Negro families live on
the southern fringe of the county,


in East Palo Alto and East Menlo
Park, and there is a working-class com-
munity in South San Francisco in the
northern section. It is a satisfied Re-
publican district that liked the lack-
lustre representation that was given it
by Younger for the past fifteen years.
In a less homogeneous and conser-
vative district, Mrs. Black’s opponents
(three Republicans and six Democrats)
could provide an interesting test of
voter attitudes toward Vietnam and
other issues of the 1968 election. The
candidates represent points of view on
the war ranging from the most dovish
to the most hawkish. But since nothing
has been succeeding in California poli-
tics like glamor, this campaign begins
and ends with Shirley.
A resident of San Mateo County for
thirteen years who now lives in the
horsy community of Woodside, Mrs.
Black brings to the campaign the do-
gooder credentials of a Junior League-
type mother of three teenagers. Her
husband, Charles, is the wealthy son
of a former president of the Pacific
Gas & Electric Co. who spends his
time looking after his investments.
As Senator George Murphy and
Governor Ronald Reagan demonstrated,
however, a Hollywood name must be
hitched to a believable political image.
In 1964 Murphy assumed the role of
the kindly Irish uncle. Last year
Reagan was the concerned citizen fight-
ing the evil politicians. And Mrs. Black
is the worried mother who wants to
make the world a better place for her
children. The movie star turned poli-
tician has the instant recognition and
name identification so important in
today’s fluid politics. But once a Holly-
wood personality declares as a candi-
date, he or she need never again men-
tion the show-business past and is free
to concentrate on the establishment of a
political image, while other candidates
plaster the countryside with billboards
and—as one of Shirley’s desperate
opponents has done—even resort to
such stunts as going up in a balloon to
try to make their names known.
In Mrs. Black’s campaign there is a
studied effort to play down her movie
and television career. Almost as an after-
thought, her campaign brochure refers
to her as “a leader in the entertain-
ment industry” on the same page with
a stern-visaged picture of her visiting
Red Square. Mrs. Black may be the
only 39-year-old woman in the United
States deliberately trying to look older
than her years. Her dresses are expen-
sive, but they are not chic. They reach
well below the knees for that sensible,
mature look.
Like all candidates, Mrs. Black has
a little speech. Before businessmen’s
luncheon clubs she begins with Vietnam
and goes from there to riots, high taxes,
and morality. In talking with house-
wives at three or four coffee hours a
day, she emphasises moral problems.
Shirley’s opposition to the showing of
the movie “Night Games” at the San
Francisco Film Festival last year on the
grounds that it was pornographic is
well remembered, but she claims she is
not “an advance lady for Carrie
Nation.” Mrs. Black attempts to be
humble, too. She notes that she was a
Depression baby, that her father had to
work at two jobs to support her family,
that her mother made all of her
clothes, and that the radio was their
only recreation. She never mentions that
she was working in the movies at the
age of three and made a fortune in
the grim 19305. She also takes the time
before audiences of women to explain
that her decision to run was made with
the full support of her husband and
children (“We have a Family Coun-
cil every night and one night the sub-
ject was whether Mother should go to
Congress”) and that the whole Black
family would move to Washington
should she be elected.
Discussions of morality and family
life seem to come naturally enough
to this small, neat, dark-haired woman
with the flat California voice much
more naturally, in fact, than her com-
ments on Vietnam. She says that Presi-
dent Johnson should pay more atten-
tion to the advice of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff and less to the man she des-
cribed in her maiden speech as Senator
McNamara. She notes darkly that
McNamara’s middle name is Strange.
Shirley claims that she is seeking as
much information as possible before
advocating a solution to the Viet-
namese War, but she does not quail
at the hawk line. She has suggested
mining Haiphong harbor, which she
says can be done by two airplanes in
four hours. She even seems to be a
fatalist about a Third World War,
noting that U.S. strategy in Vietnam
should not be based on fear of setting
off a conflagration. “We mustn’t be
afraid of this war that may come some
day,” she says. “I think it will happen,
anyway.”
Mrs. Black supports the United
Nations because “it does serve to keep
the lines of communication open,” but
says that “most of it is communist
propaganda.” She is against foreign
aid because it is a handout, and opposes
trading with communist countries be-
cause “When we send them a nail
I’m afraid it will come back as a
bullet, in the back of one of our
soldiers.”
In discussing riots, high taxes, and
“the breakdown of moral principles,”
Mrs. Black decries “the lack of inspira-
tional leadership at the top.” She also
says she is disturbed because “we don’t
have any words to live by” and firmly
declares that such slogans as “Beautify
America,” “Brush Your Teeth After
Every Meal,” and “Keep Physically
Fit” simply aren’t good enough. She
doesn’t suggest what new slogans might
uplift America, but the women in her
coffee-hour audiences solemnly nod in
agreement as Shirley calls for re-dedi-
cation. She talks about rights and
responsibilities (“No one has a right to
a color TV unless he can pay for it.
No one has a right to a job unless he’
is qualified for it”) and declares that
the only anti-poverty program she sup-
ports is Head Start.
Mrs. Black may be even more con-
servative than she seems on the public
platform. When deploring the high rate
of drug arrests in San Mateo County
and its high drinking, divorce, and
suicide rates one day before a Kiwanis
Club luncheon, she suddenly stopped
and asked: “Is the water fluoridated?”
Some of the cities in the county fluori-
date their water and others don’t, and
here, as elsewhere, the ultraconservatives
have almost equated fluoridation with
Communism.
Helping to keep Mrs. Black from
making mistakes are the canny political
public-relations firm of Whitaker and
The housewife-and-mother candidate
. .. her opponents are in despair
Baxter, Vic Gold, who served Gold-
water as a Press aide in 1964, and
Robert Walker, who became involved
in Shirley’s campaign last summer. He
previously had worked in Washington
with Dr. Gaylord Parkinson when he
headed the Nixon for President offices
in the Capital. Gold and the Whitaker
and Baxter men were pulled into the
campaign a month before the election
when polls showed Mrs. Black in the
lead with half the voters undecided.
She also has the support of much of
the country’s Republican leadership.
And how do you fight Shirley
Temple? Two of her opponents went
to Vietnam for a few days. Another
went to Washington for a day. And
everywhere candidates are shaking
hands, visiting shopping centres, drink-

ing coffee, suffering through luncheon-
club meetings, and putting up bill-
boards as they desperately bid for the
name identification that has put Mrs.
Black so far . out in front. Mrs. Black’s
principal Republican opponents are
conservatives whose positions on Viet-
nam do not differ greatly from her own.
One is William H. Draper 111, a
young businessman who is the son of
a former Under Secretary of the Army.
Draper, who has some backing from
the county’s Republican hierarchy, took
his campaign to Vietnam for a few
days. He is fighting to make his name
known in the county and he refers
to his extensive handshaking and door-
to-door campaigning as “hand-to-hand
combat.”
One Republican, Robert R. Barry,
gave up the fight altogether, with-
drawing from the race three weeks
before election day and urging his
backers to support Mrs. Black. Barry,
who once represented part of New
York’s Westchester County and ran
against Democratic Representative
John Tunney in Southern California
last year, had been labelled “Rent-a-
Congressman” Barry by some of his
former colleagues.
Among the six Democratic candi-
dates is former “Ramparts” magazine
publisher Edward M. Keating, who
unsuccessfully ran for the Democratic
Congressional nomination in the county
last year. He is calling for an imme-
diate end to U.S. involvement in the
war in Vietnam. And there is Patrick
F. X. McGucken, of Emmitsburg, Mary-
land, who, from a bivouac in a San
Mateo motel, proclaims himself a stand-
in for President Johnson and is the
only Democrat who has allied himself
with the President. The lone Indepen-
dent candidate, former jockey Willie
Slocum, a long shot, left the narrowing
field in mid-October.
Most of Shirley’s opponents are try-
ing to ignore her candidacy, an
admittedly difficult thing to do with
reporters from publications throughout
the world seeking interviews with her.
Some try to combat her appeal by say-
ing that a woman’s place is in the home,
particularly when she is the mother of
three teenagers. The always hopeful
Keating discerns a Shirley Temple
Blacklash among middle-aged house-
wives. Another Democratic candidate
concedes, “She’s very popular and . . .
has a darn good chance of winning.”
When Mrs. Black was still trying to
make up her mind to run late last
summer, there was some talk among
California Republicans that her can-
didacy would break the magic mirror
of Hollywood glamor politics. But now
Republican leaders in the State are
assuming that Mrs. Black will be elec-
ted to Congress and that someday she
will succeed to the Senate seat held
by George Murphy, with whom lovable
little Shirley Temple once danced in
a movie.

The
Robert Graves
translation of
the Rubaiyyat
By ROBERT GRAVES
The Fitzgerald translation
AWAKE! for Morning in the Bowl of Night
Has flung the Stone that puts the Stars to Flight:
And Lo! the Hunter of the East has caught
The Sultan's Turret in a Noose of Light.
Dreaming when Dawn's Left Hand was in the Sky
I heard a Voice within the Tavern cry,
"Awake, my little ones, and fill the Cup
Before Life's Liquor in its Cup be dry."
Here with a Loaf of Bread beneath the Bough,
A Flask of Wine, a Book of Verse and Thou
Beside me singing in the Wilderness
And Wilderness is Paradise enow.
"How sweet is mortal Sovranty!"—think some:
Others "How blest the Paradise to come!"
Ah, take the Cash in hand and waive the Rest;
Oh, the brave Music of a DISTANT Drum.
The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,
Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit
Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,
Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it.
SHEIKH GHIATHUDDIN Abdul
Fath Omar ibn Ibrahim al Khayaam al
Ghaq, better known as Omar Khayaam,
was born at Nishapur in A.D. 1015, of
Afghan parents from the Sufi com-
munity at Balkh, then part of Persia.
Most lifelong admirers of Edward
Fitzgerald’s translation—or, to borrow
his own jocular word, “transmogrifica-
tion”— of Omar Khayaam’s “Rubaiy-
yat” are unaware that the 15th-century
manuscript at Oxford from which he
worked is far from being “perhaps the
earliest in existence.” Or that an
authoritative 12th-century text has been
available to Sufi students in Afghanistan
since shortly after Khayaam’s death
more than 800 years ago. I have made
an English verse rendering of this
earliest and most authoritative
“Rubaiyyat” at the request and under
the surveillance of Omar Ali-Shah, the
Sufi poet and classical Persian scholar
to whose family the manuscript belongs.
To be entrusted with this task was the
greatest poetic compliment I have ever
been paid.
Edward Fitzgerald (1809-1883),
widely celebrated as the supposed
originator of the “Rubaiyyat,” was an
amateur Orientalist who constructed a
revolutionary mid-Victorian poem of his
own from an ill-understood classical
Persian text. Its publication in 1858
coincided with a strong anti-devotional
movement among young Englishmen,
encouraged in their free-thinking by
Charles Darwin’s newly broached doc-
trine of evolution. As a result, Fitz-
gerald’s “Rubaiyyat” became suddenly


famous. For four generations, indeed,
by a curious paradox, Omar Khayaam’s
noble and mystical poem has been mis-
conceived throughout the West as a
drunkard’s rambling profession of the
hedonistic creed: “Let us eat and drink
for tomorrow we die.” Khayaam is also
credited with a flat denial either that
life has any ultimate sense or purpose,
or that God can be, in justice, allowed
any of the mercy, wisdom, or perfection
illogically attributed to Him; which is
precisely the opposite view to that ex-
pressed in Khayaam’s original.
Not many years after the Norman
Conquest of England, this middle-aged
Persian university professor broke
away from his academic colleagues at
the College of Nishapur and returned
to the mystical Sufic way of thought
from which, perhaps because obvious
recourse to it might have prejudiced
his formal education, he appears to have
lapsed in early manhood. Khayaam
had become not only a famous ortho-
dox Moslem philosopher, but also an
inventive mathematician whose trea-
tise on algebra is still admired, and an
outstanding astronomer: indeed he
played an important part in reforming
the Moslem calendar, some five cen-
turies before the Christian calendar was
similarly taken in hand. This defection
from orthodoxy caused a scandal.
Khayaam’s university colleagues felt
only scorn for Sufis, whom they re-
garded at the best as heretical enthusi-
asts; yet now a revered colleague had
started writing ecstatic poetry and
placed himself in pupilage once more
to a sheikh, or teacher, who would
treat him like a schoolboy throughout
the customary 12 years of Sufic train-
ing!
In Khayaam’s stanza 70 we find a
reference to this Sheikh, who advised
him to think with his heart and not .
be influenced by literary or theological
tradition:
But prudently my Teacher warned me:
Pen
And Tablet, Heaven and Hell, lie in
yourself.”
Khayaam treats wine in Sufic fashion
as a metaphor of the ecstasy excited by
divine love: a simple concept not readily
grasped by Westerners, if only because
they are convinced that wine-drinking
was forbidden by Mohammed in the
Koran. This is a mistake: only the
drinking of date-liquor, which caused
much bloodshed and disorder in 7 th-
century Arabia, came under the
Prophet’s ban. Wine had long been
used for religious purposes by the
Hebrews (many of whose doctrines
Mohammed accepted). Because of the
divine-love metaphor attached to wine,
four cups had also been compulsory at
the Festival of Passover, which com-
memorated both God’s gift of bread to
man and His rescue of Israel from
Egyptian bondage. Hence the appear-
ance of wine in the Last Supper narra-
tive, from which the Christian com-
munion rite was formalised. Neverthe-
less, puritanical theologians of
Khayaam’s day had attempted to ban
all alcoholic drinks: much as Orthodox
Jewish rabbis still enforce the Fourth
Commandment by forbidding even the
poking of a fire on the Sabbath day.
Moreover, drunkenness had been fre-
quently used by the abstemious Hebrew
prophets as a metaphor .not of religious
ecstasy but of irreligious folly. Thus the
Nishapur puritans could justify their
un-Koranic ban on wine as being tradi-
tional and also as serving to preserve
law and order. Khayaam rejected this
view.
Edward Fitzgerald first met the
“Rubaiyyat” through Edward Cowell, a
fellow-undergraduate at Trinity College,
Cambridge. Cowell was rated as a fair
Persian scholar and, according to a bio-
graphical preface attached to most
modern editions of Fitzgerald’s work,
“may be said to have disentombed
Omar’s poems from oblivion since,
laboring as they did under the original
sin of heresy and atheism, they were
seldom looked at. Omar was no more
of a Mohammedan than many of our
best writers are Christians.”
Yet the senior male line in descent
from the Prophet himself had trans-
mitted, and still transmits, to its sons
the secret Sufic doctrine that he
bequeathed them; so that to call
Khayaam “no more of a Mohammedan
than many of the best English writers
are Christian” borders on the absurd.
Fitzgerald, justifying his earlier free
translations from Calderon’s Spanish
and from Aeschylus’ Greek, wrote:
“In the absence of a poet who can
recreate in his own language the body
and soul of a foreign poet, the best
translator is one who paraphrases the
The Graves translation
While Dawn, Day's herald straddling the whole sky,
Offers the drowsy world a toast "To Wine,"
The Sun spills early gold on city roofs
Day's regal Host, replenishing his jug.
Then shouts ring out among us at the tavern:
"Rise, too, you good-for-nothing tavern lad!
Refill our empty bowls with today's measure
Before the measure of our lives be filled!"
A gourd of red wine and a sheaf of poems
A bare subsistence, half a loaf, not more
Supplied us two alone in the free desert:
What Sultan could we envy on his throne?
They say that Eden is bejewelled with houris;
I answer that grape-nectar has no price
So laugh at long-term credit, stick to coin,
Though distant drums beguile your greedy ear.
What we shall be is written, and we are so.
Heedless of God or Evil, pen, write on!
By the first day all futures were decided;
Which gives our griefs and pains irrelevancy.

The Graves translation of the Rubaiyyat
original work, while conserving the
author’s spirit.”
“A sort of literary metempsychosis,”
agreed George Saintsbury, the most
influential critic of the early 20th-
century and a fervent admirer of Fitz-
gerald’s “Rubaiyyat.” He wrote in his
preface to one edition: “This is a chose
jugee: depreciation of it would be idle
paradox; praise is superfluous” •
believing, like almost everyone else,
that Fitzgerald had magisterially im-
posed decent literary order on a
jumbled ragbag of discarded Oriental
verse. He commented also: “Whether
we have ever had a greater translator
than Fitzgerald, whether we have ever
had one nearly so great, remains a
question. What is quite certain is
that we have never had anyone who,
in verse, confining himself almost, if
not quite, wholly to translation . . .
did it so magnificently. To us, legiti-
mately,' Fitzgerald is Omar Khayaam
and one may almost dare* to say Omar
Khayaam is Fitzgerald.”
Yet, take stanza 50 in Fitzgerald’s
Second Edition as an instance of his
frequent failure, even when disfiguring
the sense, to write a simple quatrain:
The Ball no Question makes of Ayes
and Noes,
But Right or Left as strikes the Player
goes;
And He that toss’d Thee down into
the Field,
He knows about it all He knows
HE knows!
Khayaam had written:
Poor ball, struck by Fate’s heavy polo-
mallet,
Running whichever way it drives you,
numbed
Of sense, though He who set you on
your course,
He Knows, He Knows, He Knows.
The extent of Fitzgerald’s mistransla-
tions can be judged by comparing his
stanza 42 with Khayaam’s 64. Fitz-
gerald writes:
And lately, by the Tavern Door agape,
Came shining through the Dusk an
Angel shape
Bearing a Vessel on his Shoulder; and
He bid me taste of it; and ’twas the
grape.
The 1 “angel shape” is an error: he
read the Persian phi (old man) for pari
(fairy). Khayaam had written ironically:
In drink this evening, as I passed the
tavern,
A fellow-toper met me with a flask.
Cried I: "Old man, have you no awe
of God?”
"Come,” he said, "God is bountiful!
Come, drink!”
Fitzgerald’s famous “Thou beside me
singing in the Wilderness” has been the
subject of countless Bume-Jonesian
illustrations since Fitzgerald first pu-
lished it; and "Thou” is always depicted
as a beautiful young houri. In
Khayaam’s original (12), however, the
"Thou” does not sing, and is not a houri
but merely his Sufi fellow-initiate, with
whom he meditates over a book of
poems —
A gourd of red wine and a sheaf of
poems
A bare subsistence, half a loaf, not
more —•
Supplied us two along in the free desert:
What Sultan could we envy on his
throne?
Omar Ali-Shah writes in a preface to
our translation: “Khayaam’s fame has
survived various unfounded charges of
crime and perversity. I hold to our
family tradition that his Jove was
centred on Halima Begum, daughter
of an official at Alp Arslan’s court,
whose hand was denied to him because
she had been betrothed to another man
in infancy. Omar brought no pressure
to bear on her parents, as a lesser man
might have done in his privileged cir-
cumstances, but honored the bond. He
is said never to have betrayed this
love by any unguarded word or deed;
yet his poems bear the unmistakable
stamp of one whose* Muse was for ever
sacred to him. He lived, wrote, and died
still true to the traditional virtues of his
noble house. Some may dispute the
authenticity of his last prayer: “O God,
Thou art aware that I have known
Thee to the full extent of my powers.
Forgive me, for my knowledge of Thee
is my means of coming to Thee!” but
none can dispute that of his self-epitaph:
Though pearls in praise of God I never
strung,
Though dust of sin lies clotted on my
brow,
Yet will I not despair of mercy. When
Did Omar argue that the One was
Two?
A main confusion in orthodox
Moslem thought was derived, Khay-
aam suggests, from an anthropo-
morphic view of God as the Universal
Father. He had been presented first as
stooping to mould man from clay in
His own image (82); then as knowing-
that sin is at once wrong and irresis-
tible, though ordering man to abstain
from it (83) under pain of Hell; finally
as spreading snares (85) to catch him
wherever he went, while still calling
him a rebel if he got caught. Such a
concept of God, Khayaam holds,
necessarily draws from a Sufi the scorn-
ful question (88); “Say, am I sinful?
Are you not my Master? Who sins
when You alone created me?”
Fitzgerald denounced this apparent
blasphemy, brushing aside Khayaam’s
demand for a purer view of God as
perceptible under an infinity of dis-
guises (57).
Hidden you live, inscrutable as ever:
A person sometimes, but sometimes a
place,
Showing this costly spectacle to no
one
You, the sole audience and the actor,
too.

Khayaam,” published by Cassell and Co.


OVERSEAS
Stalin, “the giant loved
even by babies”
By DENNIS BLOODWORTH
THE ANNIVERSARY of the October
revolution on November 7 has pro-
voked the usual seasonal discharge of
venom from Peking, where Premier
Chou En Lai has described the com-
memorative meeting of Communist
Parties in Moscow as part o,f a Soviet-
American program to build a “counter-
revolutionary alliance against Albania
and China.” “The fact that these
revisionist traitors are opposing us,”
added another Chinese leader with
back-handed Maoist logic, “just shows
that we are the real heirs of the
glorious October revolution.”
It is now axiomatic that while other
men turn east to pray, the Chinese
turn west to curse, and for the past
month more and more accusatory,
fingers in Peking have pointed magneti-
cally toward Moscow. The Chinese
Communist Press has accused the Soviet
Union of masterminding recent Indian
“aggression” against Tibet, and has
alleged that after the consequent border
clashes the Indian Defence Minister
flew to Moscow to “claim his reward.”
The Russians were said to have
dispatched $750 million worth of arms
aid to India, followed by a further
$450 million in economic credits, in
recognition of New Delhi’s “frantic
rhti-China activities.” For all their
gratitude, however, the Russians were
also “flooding India with poor-quality
goods at high prices,” so that “Soviet
revisionism now ranked only behind
American and British imperialism in
the magnitude of its plundering.”
The Russians had also reduced Outer
Mongolia to the status colony,
ruthlessly exploiting it as a source of
raw materials. Their string-of-beads
sales technique was so unscrupulous that
the gentle Mongolians were paying 40
sheep for a Soviet tyre, 26 sheep for a
real radio set, and one sheep even for
a toy one. '
In Africa, the Muscovites “behaved
atrociously,” disdained the blacks, and
devoted their energies to acquiring
villas and cars and fridges, the Chinese
added.
Even in their own country, the
Soviets were colluding with capitalists,
planning joint-exploitation of Siberia’s
natural resources with the predatory
and imperialistic trusts of Tokyo at
the expense of the Soviet people.
There is nothing unfamiliar about
Sino-Soviet mutual mud-slinging, but
this year new trimmings have been
added to the old hat. For the inter-
national Communist movement is not
celebrating any ordinary anniversary
of the Revolution, but the 50th. On
this historic occasion, therefore, China
is particularly anxious to expose to the
world the Russian relapse into their
heresy of capitalism, to establish
Maoism as the one true faith and
Peking as its mecca. The Soviet
leaders are depicted not only as white
imperialists abroad but also as the
grasping and pitiless masters of an
unholy Mother Russia, whose oppressed
masses look back yearningly to the days
of Stalin “a giant loved by all
Soviet citizens, even the babies.”
This week the Peking Press accuses
the Soviet Government of mowing
down workers with tanks and cramming
thousands of others into new concen-
tration camps in its efforts to smash
rising revolutionary opposition. The
“New China” news agency also attacks
the Russian authorities for flouting the
fundamental socialist principle of dis-
tributing machines to State enterprises
according to the needs of the State
plan as “out of date.” In a society in
which the number of millionaires among
the new privileged class is “steadily
increasing,” the leaders are thus taking
a further giant step backward to capi-
talism by letting the sacrosanct “means
of production” be sold on the free
market.
Radio Peking has, meanwhile, chas-
tised the Russians for allegedly per-
petuating the “Soviet bourgeoisie” by
discriminating against peasants and
workers and giving most places in high
schools and colleges to the sons and
daughters of wealthy commissars. In
Moscow, a business firm assures places
in colleges for the arrqgant offspring
of Russia’s new generation of young
gentlemen on payment of a few
thousand roubles, the Chinese sneer.
This “riding roughshod over the
people,” it is implied, is in marked
contrast to the new system in China
under which candidates for higher
institutes of learning are to be selected
primarily for their proletarian back-
ground and “revolutionary conscious-
ness,” not by bourgeois standards like
their IQ or their excellence in examina-
tions. Earlier this year the Peking
“People’s Daily” claimed that the Rus-
sian educational authorities had ordered
Peking thunders, “We are the real heirs
of the glorious October revolution”
a special volume of stories from the
Bible to be compiled, and were poison-
ing the minds of innocent children by
“openly peddling this religious drug.”
Against this background of black
treachery, it is all the easier to delineate
the purity of the Chinese cultural revo-
lution, with Mao Tse Tung’s moralistic
emphasis on self-denial, on communal
effort, and on the struggle for a classless
society.
In a typical Middle School in China,
for example, 15 hours a week will in
future be devoted to studying the works
of Mao, 20 to political criticism and
“struggle” sessions connected with the
cultural revolution, and only the re-
maining 20 to other subjects, including
language teaching, for which the texts
used will be exclusively the works of
Mao all over again.
This devotion to ideology and the
class war is to be seen in all fields.
Chinese nationalists earlier derided the
Communists for producing playing-
cards on which the bourgeois reactionary
initials, “K”, “Q”, and “J” for kings,
queens, and jacks had been replaced
by numbers, while roses, orchids, and
peonies replaced spades, diamonds, and
—rather disquietingly—hearts.
Recently the Shanghai revolutionary
committee attacked excessive card-play-
ing during working hours, and urged
men to concentrate rather on the study
of Mao’s thought.
China’s current disc hit, at seven
shillings, consists of a reading of the
“sixteen points.” These were elaborated
by the Central Committee of the Party
in August, 1966, as the guidelines for
the great cultural revolution, and are


available on a single long-playing
gramophone record (33 rpm) by mail
order.
Switch on the newest giant transistor-
ised electronic computer built under the
aegis of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, and it first sings “the east is
red,” next draws a picture of Chairman
Mao, and then in his own fierce calig-
raphy writes “serve the people” be-
fore getting down to normal work.
The computer has been described as
a “brilliant fruit” of Chinese Com-
munism which reveals the “bankruptcy”
of revisionist Russian methods of re-
search. The Chinese have been inspired
by a long line of well-advertised model
Maoists during the past few years
dedicated soldiers, faithful cadres, self-
sacrificing revolutionaries. But in its
impeccably mechanical loyalty to Mao’s
thought this latest contrivance must be
given pride of place as the truest child
of the cultural revolution, whose
example 700 million Chinese should
now strive to emulate. And it is hard
to see the Russians competing with
that.
South Vietnam
A "Rebellion" PM
THE SECOND REPUBLIC of South
Vietnam was born last week, almost
four years to the day after the death of
the first republic of President Ngo Dinh
Diem. “How many republics have the
French had? Five?” asked a young
Vietnamese politician at the celebra-
tions at the presidential palace that
night. “Well, we’ve still got a long way
to go.”
The Americans, needless to say, hope
hot. Having at last somehow herded the
unruly Vietnamese soldiers and poli-
ticians into the confines of a constitu-
tion, they now very much want to see
a decent period of rule that is stable,
legal, and eventually blessed with a
greater degree of genuine popularity
than the elections of the past year have
been able to show. If President Nguyen
Van Thieu has sometimes seemed
strained during the junketings of the
past few days, it is understandable
enough. He has a huge job ahead of
him. Even the appointment of his first
Prime Minister has been difficult, and
the final choice of the 45-year-old Mr.
Nguyen Van Loc is certainly going to
cause a new set of problems.
In the first place Mr. Loc is regarded
as a protege of the new Vice-President,
Marshal Ky, which suggests that the
latter’s strength will be considerably
greater than the humble role laid down
for him by the constitution. Secondly,
Mr. Loc is certainly not the man the
Americans wanted (which, of course,
is one fact, at least, in his favor in the
eyes of some Vietnamese). A French-
educated lawyer, he has had virtually
no administrative experience and his
most apparent characteristic, in the
words of one Vietnamese, is “smooth-
ness.”
Perhaps more important still will be
Mr. Loc’s ability, or lack of it, to act
as a bridge to the civilian politicians
in opposition. On the surface he has
some of the right qualities. He is a
southerner, and fought with the Viet-
minh against the French for two years.
He has the prestige of being a writer,
whose early works include novels with
titles like “Social Classes” and
“Rebellion.” He also happens to be the
brother of a leading southern politician
who last year resigned his post as
Education Minister in a group protest
against the activities of the police chief,
General Loan.
The trouble is that a lot of politicians
distrust Mr. Loc simply because of his
past association with Marshal Ky. So
it remains to be seen whether he can
really help President Thieu achieve the
political consensus that the Americans
so bady want to see in Vietnam.
There has, however, been one very
interesting political development in
Saigon that may make for a healthier
political life. The Lower House, elected
nine days before President Thieu’s in-
auguration, contains a handful of people
of militant Buddhist and Leftist tinge
who were barred even from running in
previous elections. The most eye-catch-
ing of these is Professor Ho Huu Tuong,
one of the brightest Vietnamese intel-
lectuals of the prewar generation. In
his day Professor Tuong has been a
Thieu and Ky, Second Republic leaders ... "still a long way to go”
Trotskyist and later a political adviser
of the Binh Xuyen, a notorious sect of
near-bandits who fought against Diem.
He now has considerable popularity
among students, and may well influence
the younger members of the Lower
House. Professor Tuong and others like
him would have great importance the
moment negotiations to end the war
became a reality and particularly if
anyone wanted to reach an understand-
ing with the Liberation Front.
Russia’s space bomb
The equaliser
RUSSIA’S APPARENT development
of a sub-orbital space bomb will not
substantially affect the balance of mili-
tary power but it could further under-
mine the prospects for agreement on
arms limitation and control.
This was the first reaction of Euro-
pean defence experts to the announce-
ment by United States Defence Secre-
tary Robert McNamara that Russia
appears to be developing this new
weapon. Mr. Alastair Buchan, Director
of the British Institute for Strategic
Studies, said: “I am afraid this is part
of the general destabilisation in great
power relations being caused by de-
velopments in weapon technology.”
The hope had been that when both
sides had achieved an effective “second
strike” capability the means to hit
back hard after a major nuclear attack
a stable balance would persist. But
this was proving illusory. The U.S.
may have aggravated these develop-
ments by constantly claiming superiority
in numbers of nuclear rockets, Mr.
Buchan suggested, and had underrated
the resentment caused in Russia.
Mr. Kosygin had implied that seri-
ous negotiations on arms limitations
would be. possible only if the U.S.
would accept “parity” with Russia. The
space bomb might be an attempt to
achieve such parity, said Mr. Buchan.
American sources in London at the
weekend discounted suggestions that
the new weapon would lead to a break-
down in the space and test-ban treaties.
There was no evidence that the Rus-
sian weapon had carried a warhead
into space, or that a nuclear device had
been exploded outside the atmosphere.
Nevertheless, there is known to be
increasing military pressure in the U.S.
for warhead trials in space to test the
anti-ballistic missile system now being
installed.
It is thought that Mr. McNamara
may have chosen this moment to an-
nounce the Russian developments,
partly to be able to anticipate a dom-
estic leak and to put the military signifi-
cance of the space bomb into perspec-
tive, and partly to forestall the Rus-
sians, in case they ,were planning to
announce a new “secret weapon” at
their celebrations of the revolution.

Pork-barrel poll
By HARVEY STOCKWIN
ALTHOUGH THE FILIPINOS have
already spilt millions of words on their
current elections, I have yet to hear
or read an authentic piece describing
what are the main concerns in the
barrios (villages) throughout the
archipelago.
There are approximately 35 million
Filipinos. There should therefore be
between 15 and 23 million voters.
There won’t be. Some are disenfran-
chised by illiteracy, many' more be-
cause a new register has been not-too-
efficiently compiled this year. Hence
the crack, born of the cynicism which
is one of the Filipinos’ most endearing
traits—“ The public are off to the grave-
yards (for All Souls’ Day). So are the
politicians there are a lot of voters
there!”
Towns throughout the Republic are
electing their mayors and provinces
their governors. This is a deadly serious
business, literally. The numerous killing
(21 dead so far), wounding, or shoot-
ing incidents the means whereby
the outside world usually hears that a
Filipino election is taking place—are
by-products of these contests. As in
America, so here, a large proportion
of Government jobs, local and national,
come out of the pork-barrel. You lose
control of patronage in the U.S., and
there are other avenues, other oppor-
tunities. Here there aren’t. Hence the
use of violence to defend that control,
by the contending cliques.
These rural rivalries may, or may
not, engender mass enthusiasm. But, in
Manila there can be no reservations.
Visibly, demonstrably, the cauldron of
Filipino politics, always simmering, is
very definitely on the boil.
The main focus of attention is the
main business of these “off-year” elec-
tions, the election of eight senators
(one-third of the Senate) on a nation-
wide basis. In other words, all Filipino
voters on November 14 will select eight
out of the 17 candidates (eight Nation-
alists, eight Liberals, one Independent),
the winners being “the magic eight”
who top the total vote.
The importance of this senatorial
election can most easily be seen against
the backdrop of the “big issue” cur-
rently distracting Manila and filling
the newspapers. Basically the issue
is simple. The Nacionalista Party,
which is, of course, led by President
Marcos, has moved for the disqualifica-
tion of the front-running Liberal
aspirant ex-G'overnor Benigno Aquino
on the grounds that he is under-age
for the Senate. In reality the ostensible
simplicity bristles with implications
and calculations.
For a start, President Marcos has
made these senatorial elections into a
personal vote of confidence. “Help
President Marcos carry cn the good
Marcos and wife...dreams of
re-election
work” scream the election posters, in-
dicating that he hopes the electorate,
realising he has performed relatively
better than previous Presidents, will re-
turn all eight Nacionalista candidates.
The eternal politicking in Congress has,
in the past two years, not always been
to the presidential liking, despite osten-
sible Nacionalista majorities in both
House of Representatives and Senate.
An 8-0 Nacionalista will not only clear
the way for the Marcos program but
will also facilitate Marcos’ dream of re-
election in 1969. No previous Filipino
President has realised this dream,
though all have pursued it.
Marcos’ hopes go against the grain
of electoral arithmetic, but many ad-
vantages are “going” for him. He is
the incumbent, an incomparable ad-
vantage in a country wherein the elec-
torate, far from complaining about
governmental funds and machinery be-
ing used to the ruling party’s advantage,
expects and accepts that it will be so
used. Marcos has, by Filipino stan-
dards, a performance to run cn, and a
party machine to back such running.
As far as can be seen his personal
popularity, and that of his charming
First Lady, is as yet not substantially
diminished.
At the start of the campaign, Marcos
was the national figure, whereas Aquino
was only a regional figure, known well
only in Manila and Central Luzon,
where he has been a very successful
Governor of Tarlac province (part of
the Huk heartland). Hedge-hopping
from barrio to barrio by his own heli-
copter, he has concentrated on the
southern Philippines, where he is least
known, unworried by money, since he
has millions of his own and is married


BOAC
has the
good
word on
air
cargo....
Rhochrematics.
It's a big word that means big things
to businessmen.
Rhochrematics (Roe-kre-mat-ics) is
the science of the even distribution of
commodities.
The word is not as important as its
meaning.
To BOAC it means offering mar-
keters more than a means of transport
from A to B. It's a complete service to
industry.
BOAC serves more than 70 cities

to more. Aquino has effectively pro-
jected an image of youth and energy
and talent. Now he is already being
talked about* as a likely winner in the
1973 presidential race. Guesses or polls
of this election bring the Marcos mar-
gin of victory down, first to 7-1, and
now to 6-2, or 5-3, as Aquino’s coat-
tails grow stronger.
Aquino’s appeal has only one flaw
—he will not be 35 until 15 days after
election day, 15 days before proclama-
tion of senatorial, winners. The law
states he should be 35 “at the time of
his election” as Senator. Hence the
Nacionalista-inspired, Marcos-directed
move for his disqualification, producing
the major uproar of the election. Does
“election” mean “election day” or the
electoral process? Should Aquino be
35 throughout, or only at the end, of
“his election”?
This close, the Marcos move appears
a colossal gamble. Aquino, if dis-
qualified, can recover, but if the courts
sustain Aquino, can Marcos? As the
newspapers testify, Marcos has invoked
the Filipino sympathy for the under-
dog.
Even if Marcos’ strategy succeeds,
he will have put Aquino out of the
running for only two years, and all be-
cause of his overwhelming desire for
8-0 now, which he still may not achieve.
Whether the Philippines will be any
stronger as a result of all these calcula-
tions is quite another matter. Pre-
occupation with political gun-fighting is
the sword by which previous Presidents
have perished. “We have both too
much and too little democracy,” as
one Filipino put it to me. Or, in the
words of ex-Senator Manglapus, the
“caricature of democracy” is a means
for _ “going through the motions but
getting nowhere.”
It would be understandable if Aus-
tralians imagined elections here as a
time when “raising living standards”
was avidly discussed. If that is your
idea, forget it. The politicians have
forgotten it, and most political
aficionados in Manila, too. But, pos-
sibly, down in the barrios, wherein
“economic development” is of neces-
sity considered in more down-to-earth
ways, they are remembering—and
wondering.
Bali
Paradise losses
FOR A LONG TIME now Bali has
been preparing for a great influx of
tourists to explore the charms of its
friendly and hospitable people, buy its
woodcarvings and silverwork, and
photograph its temples and its bare-
breasted women (who, alas, now are
getting fewer and fewer, with only the
older women keeping up the tradition).
The airport outside Denpasar, Bali’s
capital, is being modernised and en-
larged to be able to receive jets. One
year ago the Hotel Bali Beach a
modern, completely air - conditioned
hotel with all facilities, including superb
restaurants and the choice between a
rock-sheltered beach and a beautiful
swimming-pool was opened. It is
under the management of Inter-Con-
tinental Hotels of New York, which in
Asia is a certain sign of high standards.
The Indonesian tourist organisation
Nitour is fully prepared with guides and
cars to take the tourists to scenic spots,
village dances, and on shopping tours.
Provided one is not afraid of “going
native” a little, it is easy to get off the
beaten track and end up in a village
eating satay with the family and seeing
Bali as it really exists behind the thin
coating of tourist gimmicks.
But the trouble is that tourists have
so far not come to Bali in any great
numbers, though this is not the fault of
the Balinese. Hotel Bali Beach can take
550 guests and was built at great cost
by the Indonesian Government. Dur-
ing the 12 months since it opened, it
has been running at only 15 percent
of its capacity and its annual loss is
about $1 million.
The Indonesian tourist authorities
have not, however, been doing much to
promote Bali, but have left foreign
airlines flying to Indonesia to do their
work for them. Thai International
was promised landing rights in Bali
and has been promoting it ever since.
On October 1 Thai International was
supposed to have started flying into Bali
twice weekly from Bangkok and Singa-
expanding to three services
weekly in April, 1968.
This did not happen, and by the end
of September it was clear that the
planned opening could not take place.
It is not known exactly what the snag
was, but the Indonesians suddenly de-
cided to refuse the promised landing
rights, and broke off negotiations in
Bangkok. However, Thai International
officials confidently expect to begin the
service soon.
The reasons for the difficulties are
connected with the reluctance of Indo-
nesia’s own airline—Garuda—to let any
foreign company take the prestige and
profits from the anticipated Bali tourist
boom. But Garuda lacks the equipment
to run a satisfactory international
tourist line from the main traffic centres
like Bangkok and Hong Kong.
Another reason for Thai Interna-
tional’s difficulties with the Indonesians
seems to be jealousy on the part of
Java’s tourist industry, which can see
that Bali has better tourist potential.
Nevertheless, it seems likely that Bali
will serve as a new gateway to tourism
in Indonesia and will encourage tourists
to explore Indonesia’s many other
wonders once petty jealousies and
short-sighted interests cease to dominate
policy-making in Indonesia’s tourist
industry.

Eastern Economic Review," Hong Kong)


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Please be more serious, Treasury,
about those statistics
THE QUARTERLY Treasury Infor-
mation Bulletin looks like a real pre-
election job. It bursts with optimism
about the current economic situation:
“Private businesses .expect to lift their
capital expenditures in the current half-
year substantially above the level of the
preceding half-year.” “The figures for
non-dwelling building approvals fore-
shadow a firming trend in the period
ahead. Dwelling commencements were
at a record level in the September
quarter.” “Retail sales . . . moved up
sharply in September. New motor
registrations . . . continued to increase.
Industrial production has continued in
general to run well ahead of levels a
year ago. Rural output, however, is ex-
pected to decline in 1967-68 because of
poor seasonal conditions in south-east
Australia . . .”
To be fair to the Treasury Depart-
ment, there is little quarrel to be had
with this optimistic assessment as it
stands, and it is no doubt wrong to
attribute its tone to the forthcoming
election campaign. But many people
will think it is time that the Treasury
came up with more serious analyses of
forces in the economy in these quarterly
bulletins.
The Treasury, for internal policy-
making purposes, does a major eco-
nomic review in February, June, and
September, and it would not be strain-
ing its resources unduly to expect that
it could produce a version of each of
these reviews for publication. It would
be nice, for instance, to hear the Trea-
sury view at this time of two current
phenomena: the apparent contradiction
between general economic buoyancy
and the laggard state of the labor mar-
ket; and the factors the Government’s
advisers judge to be responsible for the
fast rate of price increase.
Business trends
Survey analysed
A MOST VALUABLE piece of
analysis has been done by Dr. Conrad
Blyth, an economist at the Australian
National University. Writing in the lat-
est issue of the Bank of N.S.W. Review
he describes the results of his tests on
the accuracy of the Wales-ACMA “Sur-
vey of Industrial Trends,” a quarterly
poll of industrialists and businessmen
on the state of the economy. Superfici-
ally such polls, which pose their ques-
tions in simple “better-same-worse”
terms, are unlikely to be of enough
accuracy to be valuable in
Many of the questions, moreover, are
a request for the businessman’s
hunches about the course of events in
the six months ahead.
Blyth took the results, published now
for six years, constructed indexes (dif-
fusion indexes for the initiated) and,
using simple statistical techniques,
compared the predictions they have
given with the actual facts as later
measured by the Commonwealth Statis-
tician and the ANZ Bank research
division. The general conclusion was
that the results are far more reliable
than might be expected, and Blyth
sums them up as a “useful advance
indicator of business trends and of
quantitative changes in official statis-
tics.”
To be more specific, the index on
factory output predicts two months in
advance the results of the ANZ Bank
statistics; the index from businessmen’s
estimates of the course of “new orders”
predicts it a full six months in advance
(see graph). Factory employment and
overtime appear to be reliably esti-
mated; stock movements are not so
well predicted, and manufacturing fixed
capital spending is least well forecast.
There are systematic biases in the case
of some of the businessmen’s expecta-
tions. They tend always to take on
fewer workers than they say they will,
but they work their existing employees
longer hours than they intended.
Too often official statistics are a
rather futile academic exercise in put-
ting economic history on the record.
Methods such as these are a practical
method qf getting results quickly with-
out significant losses in accuracy. Dr.
Blyth has shown the way. What is
needed now is the regular publication,
together with the survey of the diffu-
sion indexes which can be derived from
it. How about it, Wales-ACMA?
Trade fair
A working success
IT WORKED. The new-style Sydney
Trade Fair, aimed at businessmen
rather than consumers and to which the
public was admitted on only three of
its nine days, was a success by all
reports. When it closed at the end of
October, 51,163 people had visited it
and the $l2 million worth of exhibits
had already attracted orders totalling
about $5 million —an amount that is
expected to look small when compared
to the final volume that should emerge
from leads, contacts, and inquiries made
at the fair with future buyers. As a
British representative said: “Since the
majority of British exhibits were
engineering and capital goods, actual
sales during the exhibition were not
expected.” Despite this, the British did
about $500,000 worth of business.
The Romanian exhibit, coupled with
a visiting trade delegation, resulted in
$1 million in contracts, covering lace,
cheese, marble, and tractors; the East
Germans did about million worth
of business, mainly in glassware and
ceramics and textiles; Japanese heavy
equipment was the subject of heavy
inquiry, and spokesmen for the other
participants (West Germany, Belgium,
Luxembourg, India, the Republic of
China, Indonesia, Australia, and Malta)
said they expected substantial sales to
follow from the fair.
“Shorting”
How to lose money
THERE ARE BOOKS on how to make
$1 million on the stock market; there
is a court case in Sydney that shows
how to lose $750,000. “Shorting” (sell-
ing more of a stock than you own in
the hope of buying it back at a cheaper
price) is the quickest way. Evidence
given in the Equity Court last week
during an application by suspended
Sydney stockbroker Mr. W. L. D. Hew-


son for an injunction to restrain the
Sydney Stock Exchange from serving
a petition of bankruptcy on him showed
that his broking firm, W. L. D. Hewson
and Co., had gone “short” in a whole
range of mining and oil stocks three or
four months ago, when the mining mar-
ket was rising rapidly.
An accountant appointed by the
Stock Exchange to investigate Hewson’s
affairs reported that Hewson’s firm had
been engaged in extensive trading on
its own, account, and that on August
4 the firm was either short or long in
‘260 different stocks. “The most striking
thing was the large volume of transac-
tions recorded in proportion to the size
of the firm.” According to the account-
ant’s affidavit, Hewson’s biggest loss
was $313,911 on trading in Hampton
Properties, a company that . owns
200,000 acres of desert in W.A:, that
has not paid a dividend since its for-
mation in 1880, and whose shares had
been selling for around 2 cents before
nearby nickel discoveries lifted them
to around $9.
He also lost $238,884 on BHP,
$63,812 on Western Mining, $49,413 on
'CRA, $34,546 on Santos, $30,535 on
Mt. Isa Mines, $27,155 on North
Broken Hill, $12,328 on Hamersley
Holdings, $B6BB on Myer Emporium,
and $8624 on Northstate Bowling.
These losses, totalling about $788,000,
were offset a little by profits of $34,615
on Western Mining contributing shares
and $11,419 on New Broken Hill.
Anyone buying the _ shares that the
Hewson firm had been selling would
have made a handsome profit at
least on paper. Private clients of the
firm have had $250,000 reimbursed to
them (the firm’s total deficit is claimed
to be about $700,000) by the Sydney
Stock Exchange, following a levy on
members of $2OOO each. These pay-
ments will not cover the firm’s liabili-
ties to other brokers in Australia and
•overseas. And Melbourne stockbrokers
are also putting up a levy to repay the
debts of one of its former members,
Mr. F. A. Maides, who was posted as
a defaulter in September.
Shipping
Far Eastern fight
IS IT SIMPLY the effect of sensible
and overdue rationalising of facilities
in the shipping industry or are the
shareholders of Melbourne’s William
Crosby Holdings Ltd. suffering from
the “shipping war” that is now being
fought in the trade to Japan?
At the recent annual meeting the
chairman announced that his company
would suffer “quite a blow” from losing
its agency for British shipping com-
pany Ellerman and Bucknall (the “City
of . . .” ships) that it had held since
1900, and which had been the main
contributor to its shipping income.
Notice of termination of the agency by
early in the new year was stated
to be the result of the “new phase in
containerisation by overseas shipping in-
terests, the merging of ship owners, and
rationalisation of shipping agencies.”
For Ellerman and Bucknall have joined
with Blue Star and Port Line into a
container consortium.
But it is notable that the new group,
which had, in the past concentrated on
the British-Australia trade, is now,
under the name of the Atlas Line, push-
ing its way into Australia-Far East
routes despite being refused admission
to the nine-member conference that
“controls” this trade. This has resulted
in a heavy newspaper advertising cam-
paign by the conference to try to keep
the Atlas Line out, warning of the chaos
that would follow if Australian shippers
used the newcomers’ ships and so
destroyed the conference and all its
benefits. Among the members of the
conference fighting against the new-
comers is Hong Kong-based trading
giant Jardine Matheson, through its
Indo-China Steam Navigation Co. Ltd.
And interestingly enough, Jardines also
own a controlling, but not majority,
interest in William Crosby Holdings. So
Jardines had (through an associate
company) on the one hand been acting
as Ellerman and Bucknall’s agent while
on the other hand it had been trying to
keep Ellerman’s out of the Australia-
Japan trade.
It is striking that Crosby’s must give
U p tbe Ellerman and Bucknall agency
in only three months; the Clan Line and
Scottish Shire Line has given Wm.
Haughton, which has held its joint
agency for 65 years, almost two years’
notice of its intention to do likewise,
But this is only one interesting side
issue to the battle. Another is the names
of the companies involved. For the
Atlas battle, in effect, is a fight between
a combination of Ellerman’s, Vesteys
( wh i c h own the Blue Star Line) and
the ailing Cunard r (owners of the
-r, T . -7 c
Port Line) against a conference corn-
../ - , ,
P™ ( under r names of sub-
sidianes) such formidable members as
P & °, Swire Yuill, Jardine
Matheson-H. C. Sleigh, three major
Japanese lines, the Dutch Royal Inter-
ocean Lines, and the Swedish Australia-
West Pacific Line.
Space satellites
The power struggle in television
A CONSIDERABLE STORM is blow-
ing in the United States concerning the
future use and control of communica-
tions satellites for television. The storm
will hit the rest of the world very soon.
For the capacities of such satellites
are far outrunning national and inter-
national arrangements for exploiting
them. Within a very few years they
will allow global networking of many
TV channels, direct broadcasting from,
say, a Russian or Chinese transmitter
into British or other European homes,
and the provision of multiple world-
wide services for handling news,
facsimile transmission of documents,
weather data, computing facilities, and
all kinds of other information services
(quite apart from telephone calls). But
the exploitation of these possibilities
involves a tangle of economic, political,
and technical questions which we have
barely begun to contemplate.
Until now international communica-
tions have been regulated with remark-
able smoothness through organisations
such as the International Telecommuni-
cations Union, the Postal Union, and
so on.
But the emergence of the communi-
cations satellite is beginning to generate
enormous economic, administrative, and
political pressures, and the old
machinery is already creaking under the
strain.
The current row in the U.S., the
Franco-German Symphonie project
(initiated without consulting the rest
of Europe), the proposed Eurovision
distribution satellite are all foretastes
of what is to come. Russia is already
establishing a domestic TV distribution
satellite system, using her Molniya sat-
ellites, and this will cover parts of
Eastern Europe as well. France is
modifying the Brittany ground station
to receive the Molniya transmissions,
and Russian engineers are currently
building a large ground station in
Cuba. It will be some time before
China can get in on the act. But what-
ever the strict economics of satellite
broadcasting, as viewed by postal
authorities, they will be almost irrele-
vant as the new technologies become
involved in power politics.
There are thus a series of inter-
locking demands emerging at national,
continental, and global levels, which
involve problems of sharing the over-
crowded ether, of space policy, and
long-term investment decisions. The
immediate effect is the power struggle
now developing to prevent a virtual
American monopoly of these develop-
ments, which will come to a head in
1969 when the present provisional
Comsat agreement comes up for re-
negotiation. It is no secret that Comsat,
in which American interests are the
majority shareholders, hope by then to
have established an impregnable posi-
tion.
The immediate debate in the U.S.
hinges on a proposal to establish a
special satellite to distribute a nation-
wide BBC-type TV service. A specially
launched satellite could do the job for,
perhaps, £stg. 10,500,000 half what
conventional distribution by landline

and microwave links would cost. But
who should own, and operate such a
satellite? The “common carrier” com-
panies in America, which now provide
conventional cable and microwave links,
have put in a claim. But so has Com-
sat, the international corporation set
up to manage the global communica-
tions satellite network, in which other
nations, including Britain, are minority
shareholders. If Comsat got the job,
profits from distributing public TV in
the U.S. would have to be shared with
Comsat’s non-American shareholders.
Europe has scarcely begun to develop
a coherent policy for space communi-
cations. But policy-making is being
overtaken by events.
Already, for instance, a European TV
satellite is being mooted. Eurovision,
which organises European TV hookups,
has indicated that it will have a “re-
quirement” for such a satellite soon.
And a British consulting organisation
has just completed a detailed economic
study of this and other possibilities on
behalf of the Eurospace group of com-
panies (a powerful, vocal, and expert
space lobby). The study shows that a
Eurovision satellite would call for a
capital outlay of some £3,500,000 in
the first year, increasing by 10 percent
per annum, but would show an eco-
nomic return of 12 percent. The satel-
lite would be launched by the Europa
II rocket (which has the British Blue
Streak for its first stage) and would
link 18 European ground stations at the
touch -of a switch.
The British study indicates that by
1975 Europe will be needing an ad-
ditional 10,000 internal long-distance
telephone circuits, of which 4500 would
be most economically provided by a
satellite. Within a further five years,
this traffic should double.
Meanwhile, the position has been
complicated by the recent decision of
France and Germany to go it alone on
their Symphonie satellite, to be
launched in 1972 by a Europa rocket.
It will offer global relay of the Olympic
Games from Munich, and will also
allow extensive French broadcasting to
African countries.
Meanwhile, satellite technology is
developing at a hectic pace; the ulti-
mate outcome would be for satellites
powerful enough to broadcast direct to
domestic sets in private houses, allowing
people to tune in to all kinds of
global services, much as a good short-
wave sound radio can tune in to the
world. The technology capable of
achieving such things is likely to be
available much sooner than is often
realised. In a week or two, the U.S.
will launch an “advanced technology
satellite” with almost enough power for
direct broadcasting
Over all these questions hovers the
very severe problem of finding and
allocating adequate frequency bands.
The shortage of frequencies and doubts
about costs mean that European postal
authorities are taking an extremely con-
servative line about all this.
They argue that the only traffic
which could quickly show a good return
on investment is global telephony—
especially transatlantic calls—served by
the emerging Comsat system and its
successors. They are sceptical of the
demand for extensive continental or
global TV networking. Time differences
mean that much American news, for
example, happens when Europeans are
fast asleep.
On the frequency problem, the laws
of nature will probably prevent com-
plete anarchy. Playing fast and loose
with frequency allocations would simply
be self-defeating, ending in a total
communications snarl-up. The best hope
would be to move TV services up into
much higher frequency microwave
regions, where there are still extensive
bands available.
A powerful satellite 23,000 miles
above the Equator could reach into
almost every nook and cranny of a
receiving territory, eliminating the
need for elaborate masts and relay
stations. But this would also demand
completely new TV sets. To operate
at such frequencies, extremely concise
construction methods are needed, and
it is far from clear whether micro-
wave technology could lend itself to
mass production in the foreseeable
future. No one is likely to pay £BOO
for the privilege of receiving “I Love
Lucy” direct from the U.S. in the
middle of the night.
Also, it is extremely difficult to fore-
see precisely the impact of very large
electronic installations hovering in
space above the Equator. But they
offer the prospect of global communi-
cations traffic on a totally unprece-
dented scale.
They impinge on a vast variety of
interests broadcasters, telephone
authorities, rocket builders, propagan-
dists, advertisers, educationists, and,
most notably, national Governments, so
that planning and managing the new
posibilities are going to be immensely
difficult.
The Eurospace people propose a new
organisation, Eurosat, to represent the
European regional interests, with
governmental and industrial participa-
tion. It would co-ordinate interests and
prepare for the 1969 negotiations. In
the U.S. there have been suggestions
for merging the common - carrier
organisations to present a similar com-
mon front.
Whatever happens, 1969 is not far
ahead. And there is precious little time
for clarifying policies and programs.
Recent Ministerial conferences have
begun to set up a skeleton planning
framework for Europe, but space policy
is still in such confusion that it is far
from clear whether it will work. One
thing is certain —if we are to avoid
Professor Friendly’s electronic slum, a
much more urgent and sustained plan-
ning effort will be needed.


THE WEEK BRIEFLY
.For the economy: A brisk set of hopeful statistics
emerges from the latest Treasury Information Bulletin . . .
For the six months to December, forecast private capital
spending on buildings should be 27 percent more than the
prior six months, on new equipment 11 percent higher, and
total capital expenditure 17 percent higher.
The September quarter’s retail sales went up by 1.9 per-
cent on June quarter figures . . . Non-residential building
approvals are 20 percent better (in value) for the Septem-
ber quarter.
Net apparent capital inflow totalled s22om. during the
September quarter, against s93m. for the corresponding
1966 period . . . The current account deficit for the Septem-
ber quarter stood at $279m. (against the comparable
$154m.).
For the markets: A good week on Australian share
markets sent many industrials higher; nickels and the larger
miners weren’t neglected.
Equities in London behaved very cheerfully; sterling and
interest rates are influencing bond dealings . . . Mixed
trading on Wall Street put a broad range of industrials
down.
For companies: Gargantuan behaviour by Australian
Guarantee Corporation is bringing the largest cash issue
made by a locally listed financier; raisings of $9,455,158 are
to be accomplished by a one-for-five at 100 percent pre-
mium. A 15 percent dividend is to be preserved ... Far
from the fringe, the Bank of Adelaide still sent profits up
by 21 percent to $893,358 to give a 17.7 percent earning
rate ... New business written by the T and G Mutual Life
Society rose by 12 percent to assure $234m., while new pre-
mium income gained 9 percent ... A developer and civil
engineer, Project Development, saw earnings go from
$53,817 to $302,854, yet withheld dividend for the third year
running; prospects are being “enhanced.”

MEN AND MATTERS
MR. G. J. DUSSELDORP’S Lend
Lease Corporation continues to build
up its reputation as an excellent train-
ing ground for young executives; three
managing-directors of fairly lively
Sydney-based companies have been
through the executive mill at Lend
Lease now that Max Fisher is taking
on the job of m.d. of Jardine Mathe-
son and Co. (Aust.) Pty. Ltd., local
subsidiary of the extensive Hong
based group that does just about every-
thing.
In addition to their many merchant
and trading activities, Jardine’s have
a big stake in the shipping business,
and this will be like old times for
former RAN Lieut. A. Maxwell Fisher,
who spent six years in the Navy, join-
ing as a 17-year-old lad early in World
War 11. After it, he did a rehab, course
in Commerce at Melbourne University
and then got a job as a management
consultant with PA (another prolific
source of managing-directors for Aus-
tralian business). From PA he went to
Lend Lease, where he ended up a few
years ago as controller and secretary.
His move to Jardine’s (at present he
is chief executive of Lombard Aus-
tralia Ltd., another local subsidiary of
a foreign-owned group), which will take
place in January, will mean his resigna-
tion as deputy chairman of the Aus-
tralian Finance Conference, also sug-
gests some further expansion in Jar-
dine’s Australian activities that have
been built up considerably in its five
years here. For the local top job is
being upgraded from “resident execu-
tive director” (at present occupied by
Mr. G. R. B. Patterson, who is retiring
shortly, but remaining on the local
board) to managing-director.
J. G. (JOCK) PHILLIPS, the
governor-designate of the Reserve
Bank, is not as silent a man as his
recent record of making only one
speech on a banking topic would sug-
gest; at the off-the-record Press
briefings that Dr. H. C. Coombs, the
retiring governor, instituted this year,
Jock Phillips has always managed to
get in a few words despite the well-
rounded flow from his boss. And he
plans to keep up these briefings,
although there seems little likelihood
of his being any more voluble in
public than Nugget Coombs has been
(at least on central banking matters).
A Shore boy, who started off his
working life at 18 in the depression
as a $4 a week salesman in Farmer’s
haberdashery department to help pay
his way through an Economics degree
at Sydney University, Jock Phillips
moved over to the Retail Traders’
A. M. Fisher
J. G. Phillips
Association after graduating in 1932
and spent three years there before being
appointed, at 24, to a two-year spell
as economist assisting the Royal Com-
mission into money and banking. This
ended with his going to the Com-
monwealth Bank’s economics depart-
ment in 1937.
After 17 years with the bank, he
was appointed investment adviser and,
when the central banking functions of
the bank were hived off into the Reserve
Bank in 1960, he became deputy
governor, the move to the Reserve
Bank, which has economic policy re-
sponsibilities, being a natural one for
a man whose background had been
more that of an economist than a
banker.

NORTH BROKEN HILL’S FUTURE INSPIRES CONFIDENCE
Chairman reviews Mine prospects and
important investment portfolio
The annual meeting of shareholders of North Broken
. Hill Limited was held in Melbourne on Thursday,
October 26, 1967. Mr. M. L. Baillieu was Chairman.
Highlights of the Chairman’s speech were
FINANCIAL
Referring to the company’s profit of $6,409,000, Mr.
Baillieu said that Operations Surplus from mining
had contributed $3,670,000 and Income from Invest-
ments $2,739,000, or 42.7% of the year’s profit.
Royalty and taxation which amounted to $3,310,000,
bore heavily on surpluses earned from mine produc-
tion. Since 1963, mine expenditure, including explora-
tion, had risen from $6,120,000 to $10,250,000 for
the year just concluded. This could be accounted for
by a production increase of about 19% over the period,
and to greatly increased expenditure on diamond
drilling and development within the company’s leases.
As well there had been a substantial increase in the
company’s expenditure on exploration away from
Broken Hill, both on its own account, and in joint
ventures. Another important factor had been the
steady and inevitable increase in costs, despite
increased operating and organisational efficiency.
Output per contract stoping miner increased from
13.5 tons of Ore in 1963 to 18.3 tons in 1967.
LEAD
Sales of market lead for 1967 exceeded production
by 3,900 tons. Sales were 64,494 tons. The average
price was $207.81.
The present market position should continue for the
first half of 1968 but in the second half there would
be a fairly substantial increase in availabilty of lead,
leading to more difficulty in selling this product.
SILVER
Silver had been, and was still, in excellent demand.
Until May, 1967, the price range had been between
9/4Vi sterling and 9/3V2 an ounce. Action by the
United States Treasury prohibiting the export of
Treasury silver, melting down and export of U.S.
coins, and other restrictions sparked off speculative
buying. The present price was 13/5 sterling per ounce.
ZINC
The situation with zinc had not been happy from the
producers’ point of view. The company sells its zinc
to Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australasia Ltd.,
the price received being related not to the London
Metal Exchange price but to, the producer price of
zinc. This price was reduced from £lO2 to £9B
sterling on June 21.
During the year appreciable cut backs in either pro-
duction or offerings of zinc have taken place by
some major producers and the company may find it
necessary to accumulate some portion of its zinc con-
centrate production. Any surplus so accumulated will
prove to be a valuable asset in the future if rational-
isation became necessary.
NORTH BROKEN HILL ORE
RESOURCES
The grade of ore being produced had decreased since
1963 when the lead content of ore mined was 15.22%.
For the year just ended it was 12.95%. Due to the
marked increase in efficiency of contract stoping
miners, it has now become economic to mine by
open stope method ore of a lower grade than formerly
from the extremities of the Southern orebody.
This would be of great advantage to the future of
the mine.
Sinking of No. 3 shaft from 4,300 to a depth exceed-
ing 5,000 feet had begun and was now at 4,405 feet
depth. The programme will take 3 years to complete.
Approximately 5 million tons exist between No. 26
level (3,520 feet) and No. 30 level (4,120 feet) and
production from this area was scheduled for the
financial year commencing Ist July, 1971. The
mining plan does not call for ore from below the
shaft’s deepest present level (No. 31 at 4,270 feet)
for at least 15 years.
The estimated value on June 30 of forward develop-
ment was of the order $8 million.

EXPLORATION
NorthVexploration activities fall into three categories,
by far the most important of these is the search for
orebodies within its leases at Broken Hill because of
the availability of facilities for mining operations.
During the year 69,810 feet of diamond drilling has
been completed, 20,853 from underground locations
and 48,957 from the surface.
Exploration away from Broken Hill by the company’s
own staff increased during the year, as did its expen-
diture under its joint venture arrangement with
other parties.
NORTH BROKEN HILL
INVESTMENTS
The current market value of listed shares held by
the company on June 30, 1967, was $35,964 J 000
compared with their original cost of $10,343,000.
Shareholdings in companies not listed include The
Broken Hill Associated Smelters Pty. Ltd., whose
new electrolytic section of the plant will be com-
pleted on schedule and will be producing high grade
zinc before the end of 1967.
Metal Manufactures Limited group of companies
in which North had a substantial investment had
become one of Australia’s most important manu-
facturing industries and was planning major addi-
tions to plant.
Alcoa of Australia Pty. Ltd., in which North held
a 12% of, issued capital, and which was 49% held
in Australia, had announced that it expected to make
a profit for 1967. It is planned to increase the pro-
duction rate of Alcoa’s alumina refinery from 410,000
tons a year to 620,000 tons in September, 1968, and
830,000 tons of alumina per year by 1969.
All aluminium available at Pt. Henry was sold in
1966 and demand continued at a high level in 1967.
The electric generating station at Anglesea is expected
to commence supply to the Pt, Henry plants in 1969
at a substantially lower cost than the existing source
of supply.
The Electrolytic Refining and Smelting Company of
Australia in which North has a 40% interest, had
installed a shaft furnace to provide additional capacity
for casting of special copper shapes, and this will be
in operation shortly.
THE FUTURE
The company expects mining operations and the
revenue from them to be satisfactory for the 1968
financial year.
North’s potentialities for future dividend income
were greater than activities at the moment, and when
the large sum which represents the present value of
investments in Western Mining Corporation, Broken
Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd., Alcoa of Australia Pty.
Ltd., and the Electrolytic Refining and Smelting
Company of Australia, yields an appropriate return,
the company’s investment income will assume a
much greater figure than the present income from
investments.
Technically, the Mine at Broken Hill was gaining in
strength every year. Developmental work in the Mine
was well advanced, and the healthy position of the
ore reserves assured continuity of output at a good
level for many years ahead. Therefore, the Board
felt the general picture of the Company’s circum-
stances at the moment was such that it could inspire
considerable confidence. is/8466


THE
CROESUS
TOUCH
A banking man
dilates on
capital supply
BY J. C. HORSFALL
ALTHOUGH HE SAID much else of
importance on the question of the
supply and demand for capital in the
years ahead, possibly Mr. Bede
Callaghan’s most telling message to the
management conference in Canberra
last week was that management should
use the capital available to it wisely,
that is, try to maximise capital produc-'
tivity, as he put it. This is the sort of
message one might expect to come from
the managing director of the Common-
wealth Banking Corporation, who seems
to spend a good deal of his time worry-
ing about the supply side of the savings
question, something which entitles him
to point the bone at anybody, com-
panies and Government alike, who
fritters scarce capital resources away on
things that don’t make a worthwhile
contribution to national development.
This is, of course, one of the most
fascinating areas of economics in so-
called free-enterprise systems, which,
unlike socialist economies, rely pri-
marily on the price mechanism and
the profit motive for directing the
employment of capital, and, to a much
lesser extent, on direct decisions of
governments —granted that, in the case
of this country, it is sometimes difficult
to see where Government influence on
investment decisions begins and ends.
From the lofty heights of the Common-
wealth Banking Corporation it could
easily seem that the investment choices
of a lot of private concerns catering to
satisfy national predilections, say, for
cigarettes, ice-cream, beer, and so forth,
are not altogether in the best interests
of the sort of national development we
should be giving overriding preference
to.
However true this may be, it would
be only wishful thinking for Mr.
Callaghan to expect management
engaged in providing the softer things
of life to put any other interpretation
on his exhortations to them to increase
their capital productivity than their
own strictly business one, that is, to go
home and try to make their present
production operations more efficient.
This they would do, anyway,' and will
continue to do so long as people keep
buying their products. Moreover, by
doing this they make a helpful contri-
bution to the national object of maxi-
mising the availability of capital for
the hard stuff of national development.
If the mass of consumption wants
can be satisfied at the most economical
capital cost, this will leave the more
capital available for investment in
national development. So, on this inter-
pretation, the message has been de-
livered to one of the right places, even
if company management in the con-
sumer goods field will see the most
effective use of capital in their firms as
a strict business requirement for their
own rather than the national advantage.
Nothing less than the big stick of
Government direction exercised, say, by
capital issues control, arbitrary manipu-
lation of the price mechanism, or fiscal-
wise, is likely to deter them from maxi-
mising the use of capital in their firms
up to the limits of their own determina-
tions about the marginal efficiency of
capital in their particular employments
of it.
Thus, while it may be slightly irri-
tating to those with a clear-cut idea
about what is good for the economy
and what is wasteful in capital employ-
Bede Callaghan...supply of savings
ment, the whole position of capital
supply and demand has to be viewed
in the light of the country being a going
concern and wanting to carry on as
such with all its idiosyncrasies and pre-
dilections for high consumption of
whatever takes its fancy. Nor do I think
that Mr. Callaghan in his less pontifical
moments would have it otherwise. The
day that anybody manages to persuade
the Australian consumer that he has to
exercise some restraint in the interests
of generating capital for the benefit of
his successors hasn’t arrived as yet, and
Mr. Callaghan in his speech showed
himself as convinced as anyone that
high, effective demand is the key to full
employment and should be kept at a
level neither so high that we should
have inflation, nor below a level which
could invite recession.
Somebody in the CBC should write
a booklet in the same series as the PM’s
on national fitness to spell out some
guidelines for restricting consumption
so that national development projects
might be better served with supplies of
local capital. You see, as Mr. Callaghan
explained, what isn’t spent on consump-
tion is available for investment, a truism
which he borrowed from Keynes, who
built a couple of learned treatises on it.
This is something that all Australian
consumers could understand. It would
only remain to convince them of the
truth of the proposition that the pro-
vision of more local capital, as opposed
to foreign, for national development is
in their best interests, far better than
the full exercise of their consumption
hormones here and now.
Mr. Callaghan studded his address
with a wealth of information on domes-
tic saving and dilated at considerable
length not only on the usefulness of
overseas capital as a marginal adjunct
to our overall capital supplies but also
on the rights and wrongs of having it.
It was a pity he didn’t find time to give
us his thoughts on some broader influ-
ences affecting domestic saving, instead
of stopping at a paean of praise for our
institutional arrangements. One point
that arises from the Keynes’ truism is
that, in the effort to keep effective
demand topped up to a level where full
employment is attained in conditions of
price stability you are always running
into the danger of overdoing it, because
it is impossible to allow for all con-
tingencies. If you overdo it and prices
increase fairly fast, savings are liable
to become victim of a rise in the pro-
pensity to spend.
As leader of one of the big trading
banks who’ve been making their lend-
ings machinery work overtime this past
year or so to serve various general
economic and (particularly) govern-
mental purposes, perhaps this wasn’t a
subject Mr. Callaghan could feel com-
pletely comfortable about. To my way
of thinking, this welter of lending by
the banks has been largely responsible
for the present accelerating rise in con-
sumer prices, which reached a 5.6 per-
cent annual rate in the September quar-
ter and must now have deep implica-
tions for the propensitv to spend and,
pro tanto, for the rate of domestic sav-
ings. Up to now, however, savings don’t
seem to have suffered from rising con-
sumer prices. Personal savings (at least
those going into the savings banks) have
recently been particularly good. How-
ever, it is not unusual for them to run
in parallel to rising consumption before
the upper reaches of a trade cycle are
mounted, and it would not surprise me
in the least if, as the economic pace
accelerates, the propensity to spend
increases to the detriment of domestic
savings.
In those circumstances the authorities
would certainly have to consider in-
creasing interest rates to stiffen the
attraction of savings, as indeed they
would have to for general monetary
policy purposes. The longer they post-
pone action in a period of rising prices
the less effective is that action likely
to be when it is eventually taken.

SPECULATOR’S
DIARY
You must keep up
with London
mining quotes
OVER RECENT MONTHS investors
have begun to notice that from time to
time strange things are happening to
their share prices. While they’re at
home fondly dreaming of the new
Cadillac which is going to be financed
from the spoils of their latest fling in
the mining market, the prices of their
shares are mysteriously and sometimes
radically changing. They’re finding that
quite often when the market starts
fresh and new each morning, the prices
of the first sale are not in any manner,
shape, or form related to the closing
price of the previous afternoon. Being
concerned about this (and who
wouldn’t be?), most investors have
investigated and have found out what
is happening. They’ve discovered that,
although sometimes this phenomenon
has to do with after-hours news flashes
and overnight rumors, more than often
the blame can be laid at the feet of the
British.
What happens is that while we are
all asleep out here, our Pommie mates
(who live world that is 10 hours
behind ours) are trading hammer and
tongs in the 100-odd Aussie stocks that
are listed on the London Stock
Exchange. And becapse the trading is
so heavy, as it has been over recent
months, there can be considerable
changes in price levels. What, then,
happens is that as soon as the local
Exchanges open an immediate adjust-
ment is made to prices to tie in with
the last sale price overseas. Anyone
wanting to keep up with what’s happen-
ing on the London market can find the
prices up to midday (London time)
listed in a number of local dailies or
see Reuters for the full quotes.
A stock whose price looks somewhat
underquoted at the moment is Hunter
Douglas, the company which earns its
living by making and selling Venetian
blinds, shades, and .screens. Its well-
known brand names are Luxaflex,
Kirsch, Mellolite, and Shademaster.
Other products handled by the group
include aluminium sidings, roofing, and
ceilings. In addition to this, the com-
pany also makes the major proportion
of its own component parts, and, in
fact, it owns the largest aluminium and
steel strap coating line in Australia.
Profitwise the company has been on the
up and up without a break since 1963.
In the three years up to and including
the year just ended, the earnings have
doubled and have done so without the
benefit of additional capital. In the
latest year the profits were 25 percent
fatter than those of 1966 and showed a
return of 25.8 percent on paid capital.
The dividend was-also fattened up from
10 percent to 11 percent. .
So, all in all, Hunter Douglas is going
along very well indeed. The company’s
secret of success is partly due to the
fact that its products are aimed at the.
home improvement market as well as
the new building market. This means
that, although the company is well
placed to participate in any building
booms that may come along, it is not
reliant on this type of circumstance for
its main growth. Another reason for the
company’s impressive performance is its
very thorough method of marketing
and its policy of continually expanding
its line of products.
By the way, have you noticed that
London sugar prices seem to have
been firming up over the past few
weeks? The reasons for this would
appear to be the increase in next year’s
world’s consumption estimate and the
poor seasonal conditions in many of the
large producing countries in the South
American region. Although no one
expects that sugar prices will ever get
back to the crazy heights of £stg.loo
per ton, as was the case a few years
ago, there is still room for some reason-
able escalation in the current price of
around £stg.2o per ton. On this basis
it is well worth keeping one eye on the
sugar price and the other on such
stocks as Millaquin Sugar and Pioneer
Sugar Mills.
Sales for the week were Bradford
Cotton and Consolidated Rutile. Both
yielded small but juicy profits. Brad-
ford Cotton, which is going along very
well at the moment, earned $2B; while
Consolidated Rutile, which seems to
have had its run for the time being,
added a profit of $53 to kitty.

200 Hunter Douglas $2.35 $479

For a moment I thought for once in
my life I’d balanced kitty, but not so.
On checking back over my sums I
found an error. Nevertheless, I went
pretty close; kitty now has $4 in it.

A widening oil market
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON
THE OIL MARKET is taking on a
much wider interest as Bass Strait is
no longer the undisputed centre of
attraction and as other exploratory
efforts are raising investors’ hopes (and
share prices) all around Australia.
Interest in the oil market is moving
north. This week the AOG-Gulf
offshore well will be spudded in off
the Queensland coast and the Burmah
Oil - Woodside - Mid Eastern-BP-Shell-
Amalgamated Petroleum offshore drill
at Ashmore Reef, off the coast of
North-West Western Australia, is get-
ting down toward more interesting
levels.
Although there is no Australian stake
in it, the Borabi well being drilled by
the Phillips group (the first offshore
well in Papuan waters) is next to an
Oil Search area and any good news
would help Oil Search’s market.
Next year, offshore interest outside
Bass Strait will develop even further
when the Ampol-Japex well goes down
also off the Queensland coast. In addi-
tion, another offshore well in Bona-
parte Gulf is planned for November
next year, with the Alliance group tak-
ing a 48 percent interest and Arco
doing the drilling. But Bass Strait wifi
still be in the news (and a centre of
investment interest not only for BHP
but also for neighboring companies like
Woodside).
The table on the next page shows all
the wells now drilling or announced,
their state of development, and the
companies that have a stake in them.
This could be the most fascinating
time in the (non-BHP) oil market for
some years.
AOG is in an interesting phase at the
moment with the market pushing the
shares up about 60 cents in recent
weeks to $2.20. The company, which
had lost its speculative image once it
began to make money out of Moonie,
has been taking a role in the offshore
business, with a 10 percent stake in
the Golden Beach gas well and now a
stake in the Capricorn well being
spudded in this week 125 miles off
Gladstone.
Exoil already has discovered an oil-
field in its Meerenie natural-gas area
with preliminary estimates suggesting
reserves of about 300 million barrels
(worth about $lOOO million), but its
location in the centre of Australia, 140
miles from Alice Springs, raises serious
problems of economics. The group is
now getting enthusiastic about a South
Australian area, OEL-28, where it be-
lieves there are similar sands to
Meerenie. But the reason for Exoil’s
latest rise in the market has not been
oil but an “encouraging” find of uran-
ium at Mt. Painter in South Australia.
A cheaper way into this uranium
situation would be through Transoil,
which has a 45 percent interest with
the option to take up another 5 percent.
THE RETAIL TRADE has shown
some sharp rises for leading stocks this
year; Grace Bros, shares have moved
up 50 percent and Myers by 40 per-
cent. But there is another successful
retailer whose shares seem to merit a
greater improve-
ment than the 13
percent it has so far
received. That is
John Martin Co.
Ltd., the impressive
Adelaide version of
(and associate of)
suburban - oriented
Grace Bros, of Syd-
ney. But it has one
advantage over
Grace Bros, in that
it gets the best of
both worlds, having
its major store well
and truly in the
centre of the city’s
retail heart and
is at present spend-
ing some millions
building a multi-
storeyed car park
adjacent to it.
It is striking that
John Ma r t in’s
should have done
well enough in the
year to July 31 to
lift sales by about
13 percent and
profits by about 8
percent in what was
clearly a pretty
poor period for
South Australia
(directors regarded
trading conditions
as “difficult”). But
things are going
better this year and
sales are continuing
to rise despite the
disturbances caused
by the car - park
project (although the chairman did not
mention the trend of profits in his recent
address). Another impressive feature of
John Martin’s accounts is that, despite
the rising sales volume, trade debtors
dropped by $l.l million last year,
reflecting a reduction in the length of
credit offered. But the company still
insists on keeping the size of its bad
debts provision to itself; this is lumped
into the 11 percent provision for “bad
debts and deferred gross profit on exten-
ded credit sales.”
A further welcome sign is that stock
rose only three percent to service the
13 percent sales rise, so that the com-
pany achieved the comparatively good
result of profit being about 22 percent
to stock.
If the South Australian economy can
catch up with the rate of improvement
now evident in other Australian States,

The Chartist says:
SHAW RIVER ALLUVIALS N.L. is a stock worth con-
sidering purely on technical grounds by mining investors at
present, although it is certainly not a stock for the faint-
hearted, as indicated by the wide price swings from 8c to
51c on the chart reproduced back to 1966. It now appears
to be a safe buy after the last sale at 37c, which was accom-
panied by heavy volume. The consolidation formed by
market action since the break of the steep uptrend suggests
targets close to 60c and 90c; at this point the stock would
need to be reassessed for an even more optimistic long-term
target. Last sale price on 31/10/67 —37c.

then John Martin should do very well
this year. But investors should keep a
close eye on the economic statistics and
the drought, both of which will be
factors in John Martin’s earnings this
year. But with the company continuing
its move to the suburbs (it will open
a 93,000 square feet store at Marion in
March) and with the main store cat-
park due for completion next year,
this stock looks a sound and growing
retail proposition.
HOW MUCH FURTHER can Minster
Ltd. fall? The peak 1965 price of this
stock, after watering in the form of a
one-for-three bonus, was equivalent to
just on $B, and last week the shares
tumbled to $1.20. Can a stock which
earned 22.8 percent on capital for the
year to June 30, 1967, and continued to
pay the generous 20 percent dividend
despite the small margin (to yield 16.7
percent) be worth only this? The mar-
ket must be anticipating at least a
halving of the dividend to 10 percent,
for the yield on a 20 percent dividend
is about twice what the market accords
for rival up-and-coming Carpet Manu-
facturers, which has done so well with
its tufted carpets.
Apart from having to fight the trend
to tufted carpets and away from their
economy-style range, Minster has a
basic problem of producing carpet in
40in. widths, which involves seaming
and wastage in homes with rooms 12ft.
wide. The market is, naturally, worried
about the chairman’s address, which
talked of a difficult sales situa-
tion for its Westminster carpets and
revealed that turnover for the first two
months of the current year was down—
with no signs of any recovery or of a
useful alternative use to which its plant
could be put (the company was only
“looking at” the possibility of going
into tufted carpets and other soft floor
coverings).
But this may be one stock where it
could be unwise to forget the assets
backing, which at present stands at
about $2.10 a share or almost $1 above
the market; even if Minster cannot
find a profitable way to employ its
assets, someone else might. And the
assets looked pretty good; land and
buildings of s2| million were four-fifths
at cost and one-fifth directors’ valuation
in 1951, so they could well be worth
more now; plant of $2.3 million was
written down to less than 40 percent of
cost; stocks were well down at $3.3
million and debtors were also lower at
less than $1 million. Even if Minster
does a good deal worse this year its
shares should not fall much below $l.
THE CHARTIST furnishes the fol-
lowing additional comment on Broken
Hill South: An earlier target of $5.50
was given but there is now a possibility
of a move to at least $5.80 and possibly
higher for this stock.


Wm. HAUGHTON & CO. LIMITED
Registered Office: 545 LITTLE COLLINS STREET, MELBOURNE
Chairman’s Address to the Annual General Meeting
on 31st October, 1967
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I should like at the outset to correct a misconception
which is evidently fairly widespread in investment circles,
regarding the nature of the wool business carried on by
your Company.
Many people link or compare cur results with those of
Wool Selling Brokers such as Dalgety-New Zealand Loan,
Elder Smith-Goldsbrough Mort, Younghusbands and others.
The comparison is not valid. The only similarity in our
operations is that we are all in the wool industry, but your
Company operates at a different point in the industry from
these companies.
The Wool Selling Brokers (who also handle livestock and
property) operate primarily in an agency capacity for their
principals, the wool growers, from whom they earn a sell-
ing commission. Fluctuations in wool price levels have a
much more serious impact on us than on them, because
they are better able to control their percentage commis-
sions and their costs. This is not intended as a criticism
of these companies but it does need to be said, and
understood more widely.
One of our own functions is that of a Wool Buying
Broker, and for this we receive commission from the mer-
chant or manufacturer who places his order with us. How-
ever the greater fart of our operation, both in wool and
in sheepskins, involves merchanting.
Our merchanting function in the sheepskin trade,
for example, is to buv the skins and take them, as our
property, through the stages of drying, grading and packing
for export; and this includes the building of stocks, in
different States and over a wide range of types, into
marketable parcels.
Our merchanting operations in wool are the same in
principle, though not of course in detail.
Such of our business as does depend on commission
has been subject for many years to intensive and, indeed,
unrealistic competition. That this has over recent years
resulted in the failure or withdrawal of so many of cur
competitors, is small comfort to our Shareholders, even if
they are aware of it; which is perhaps unlikely since most
of our competitors are private companies, and many are
owned overseas.
Your Board has grappled with this problem for many
years. Whilst we have constantly improved our organisa-
tion and our systems of management, our policy has been
based on the Relief that unrealistically low profit and com-
mission margins could not be indefinitely sustained in the
industry, and that by maintaining a wide scope of oper-
ations in wool we stood to gain substantially from a
return to saner business. The deepened depression of wool
prices in 1966/67, however, convinced us that, though this
belief may stiff prove well founded in the long term, we
could no longer remain committed to the maintenance of
such a large establishment in an impoverished sector of
the industry. We have therefore withdrawn from those
trading activities in which we consider the margins to be
unrelated to the heavy market risk, and from such broking
activities as provide inadequate commission rates. We have
adopted 1 a more selective policy, operating strongly in those
types and markets where we have special connections and
skills. We firmly believe that the-removal of this major
cause of the wide fluctuations in our profitability must
enhance our prospects.
I feel justified in thus explaining our policies at length,
for your Directors are more than ever conscious that the
Company’s assets, though strong and secure, have not
been averaging anything like an acceptable return for a
number of years. We do, however, believe that the steps
described are those which will give Shareholders the best
return coupled with the maximum security of their original
investment, over the next few years.
To back what we believe to be our improved average
earning capacity in wool, we are further developing our
powerful sheepskins business, and these activities are sup-
ported by useful investments in shipping and travel, timber,
and general merchandise.
As a result of the rationalisation of shipping agencies
consequent on containerisation, we have received notice of
the termination from some time in 1969 of our Clan Line
and Scottish Shire Line joint agency, held since the early
1900 s. However, our Shipping Department has been in-
creasingly busy with our Japanese agencies which now in-
elude a service to South America and the Caribbean as
well as to Japan.
To illustrate the sharp adverse movements in wool
prices in the year under review, and since, let me quote the
following table of prices:—
AUSTRALIAN WOOL BOARD
Cents per lb. } clean.
64s Merino 56s Pine X’bred 50s Medium X’bred

I would ask you to note that the most significant drop
is not that of recent months, serious as 'this has indeed been
for growers and for the national economy for it was
to a great extent foreseen but the grave fall in cross-
breds between June and December of last year, which spelt
trouble for Australia’s growers, buying brokers and merchants,
and something like disaster for the New Zealand wool in-
dustry. These words were, of course, written before the
recent further reduction of the average bidding price of
the New Ze>aland Wool Commission earlier this month; the
resultant fall in crossbred prices has been more sharp and
sudden than any so far, but to the extent that it recognises
the reality that prices for wool are world prices, I see it
as a move which will facilitate an eventual return to stability,
though undoubtedly that will take a long time. Prom this
low level in crossbreds I can predict no early recovery, but
I am glad to say (without any complacency I assure you)
that your Company has been able to sustain the more
recent price fall without serious injury. As for merino
prices, I believe that we can be more hopeful, though
when a real recovery will come is another question.
Let me pass now to the Financial Statements. I
suggest that in studying them, you direct your attention
rather to the consolidated figures than to those of the
Parent Company. The consolidated figures, of course, in-
clude the results of the Subsidiaries, shares in which repre-
sent a large part of the Parent Company’s investment in
assets.
After extracting what is applicable to minority interests,
the Group sustained a net operating loss of $153,743 for
the year under review. The corresponding figure for
1565/6S was a net profit of $363,680. The details of the
year’s result are discussed on pages 4 and 5 of the Direc-
tors’ Report.
Against the operating loss of $153,743 a capital profit
of $26,923 was realised from the sales of certain non-
current assets of the Group, and, of this capital profit
$26,451 was tranferred to Realised Capital Profits Reserve.
The remaining $472, which arose from minor items, reduced
to $153,271 the total net debit to Profit and Loss Appropri-
ation Account for the year.
A credit trilance of $437,858 in undistributed profits was
brought forward at 30th June, 1966. This figure has since
been increased to $451,691 by the writing back of income
tax overprovided in previous years. Prom this, $36,030 has
been appropriated to cover the usual preference dividend.
The resultant credit of $415,681, after being reduced by
$153,271 brought in from the accounts of the year ended
30th June, 1967, leaves a credit balance of $262,420 to be
carried forward in Profit and Loss Appropriation Account
at that date.
The effect cn the Group of the drastic conditions through
which the wool trade has been passing, and which I have
earlier described, is such that the Directors regret that
they cannot recommend the payment of any ordinary
dividend.
I shall now outline the important movements in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet, comparing 30th June, 1967,
with the preceding year.

CAN MARRICKVILLE HOLDINGS
keep it up? The latest profit of $1.24
million, giving an earning rate of 21.4
percent to cover the steady 15 percent
dividend, is the biggest the group has
earned but it is also after its smallest
tax provision for many years, with tax
being only at the rate of 29 percent to
pre-tax profit instead of the normal
42£ percent. And on a pre-tax basis,
Marrickville’s latest profit was slightly
below the previous year’s and sub-
stantially below the 1963 and 1964
result, when tax provision was at about
normal rates. Had these applied in the
latest year, the company would have
earned only about $1 million, but still
enough to cover the $870,000 dividend
charge. And this is the important thing
for shareholders.
Last year the company explained its
low tax provision by pointing to the
loss from “certain subsidiaries” (the
alginates operation was still losing
money, according to the interim report
last March), from investment allow-
ances and export allowances, and these
factors would no doubt have been an
influence once again.
Of more concern to investors should
be the fact that the enforcement of
margarine quotas against the company
applied for seven months of 1966-67
and will apply for the full period of
this year (unless changes are made next
January). It seems unlikely that the
company would be able to gain the
same profit margins on its new quota-
beating spreadable “cooking” margarine,
but its success in marketing this pro-
duct may offset this in 1967-68, par-
ticularly as the company would have
faced heavy promotion expenses for it
in 1966-67.
Marrickville is tying: up its milling
operations more neatly, having bought
the outside shareholders in F. Crago
and making the natural (and wide-
spread) move into the broiler business
by acquiring a 50 percent interest in
Consolidated Poultry Industries, a big
consumer of milled products.
The 6.7 percent dividend yield from
Marrickville at current prices around
$1.12 is high enough to allow for most
# of the risks ahead for this company.
And there is a real chance that Mar-
rickville may be on the recovery road.
THE MARKET STILL seems to be
unduly hard on Duly and Hansford,
makers of Dufor motor parts and gen-
eral castings. At one stage this year,
the shares slipped below par to only
87 cents as investors became clearly
concerned that the company would not
be able to hold the barely covered 6
percent dividend (it had been 10 per-
cent for years before the 1965-66
profit slide), particularly after the
company reported a 20 percent profit
fall in its interim report. But now that
Duly and Hansford has reported a
60 percent profit recovery and increased
its dividend to percent,. the market
is still pricing the shares at only sl.lO
to yield 6.8 per cent.
But the extent of last year’s recovery
was .greater than these figures suggest,
• as the pre-tax profit jumped by more
than 80 percent. For the company’s
tax provision in the latest year is at
the rate of almost 50 percent to pre-
tax profit compared with the “normal”
rate that applied in 1965-66 of 42£
percent. And presumably some of the
capital expenditure of $226,376 (the
“adverse conditions” in the motor
vehicle and related industries meant
that this item dropped $131,624 last
year) would have been allowable as
a tax deduction, as would costs in-
volved in the 17 percent rise in export
sales.
So the tax commissioner apparently
considers Duly and Hansford’s profit
to be far greater than that which direc-
tors have reported; not all of this dif-
ference would be made up of a new
$73,000 provision for possible diminu-
tion of stock values.
It is also heartening that the 7.7 per-
cent sales rise that brought about this
big profit lift was accompanied by a
reduction of almost $300,000 in stocks
to $2.3 million and a $580,000 fall in
bank overdraft. At the same time it
is intriguing to see debtors rise 15 per-
cent to $887,923.
There is no doubt that the com-
pany’s heavy involvement in the Holden
has made it very dependent on GM-H’s
fortunes, and there appear no immedi-
ate prospects of the Holden showing
any sensational fight-back against Ford
for a year or so. But Duly directors
expect their sales to continue to rise
this year and see no “insurmountable
problems” likely to keep profits any
lower than the latest year’s, which pro-
duced an 11 percent earning rate.
Nevertheless, it may take a while yet
before the dividend gets back to 10
percent unless the company can do
appreciably better than this. The pros-
pects are that it will.

The deliberate programme of disinvestment from the
more vulnerable sections of the business has resulted in a
reduction of nearly $2,400,000 in stocks and debtors. This
Srocess continues and will show further reductions in
le current financial year. The money derived from this
disinvestment has been applied principally in reducing bank
overdraft by almost $1,200,000, and various other categories
of creditors by about $860,000.
I mentioned last year that in a very fluid export busi-
ness like ours, the Bank Overdraft position on any day
reflects the combination of the items, Stocks and Debtors
less Creditors, and is principally affected by export stocks
awaiting shipment and clearance of proceeds. The total
amount thus involved can be very large, and can vary
markedly from day to day.
Such remarks would still apply at any time, but the
very substantial reductions now recorded are the result
of planned disinvestment which at balance date was only
partly completed.
The expenditure (net after sales) on Properties, Plant
and Equipment for the year at $145,000 has again been
kept at a figure less than the sum of $184,000 which has
been provided for depreciation in the accounts of the year.
Since, in the Parent Company and in most Subsidiaries,
machinery is not a big factor, we believe this to be
sound policy.
Now a word about the future. As I have remarked
on earlier occasions, it is often a disservice to Shareholders
to make predictions, especially in a business so much
affected by world trends. At the same time Share-
holders are entitled to some guidance, and I therefore dare
to say that, having withstood the impact of still lower
wool prices in ithe new selling season, we are potentially
in a stronger position than we have been for some years.
Your Directors have kept constantly under review the
composition of the Board itself, and especially with regard
to the age of some members including myself. Yet with
the greatest degree of objectivity which we have each been
able to bring to bear, we are firmlv of opinion that know-
ledge and experience of this embattled industry are quali-
fications not to be lightly cast aside at this particular
time.
Whilst I believe that we older Directors still have an
important contribution to make for a limited period, our
retirement in due course will be made easier by the know-
ledge that we leave a strong, able and widely experienced
Board behind us. It is for this reason that we have (not
necessarily as a permanent increase in numbers) proposed
an addition to the Board. My colleagues and I were delighted
when Mr. Grahame Taylor indicated that, subject to the
consent of the Shareholders, he was ready to join our
number. I commend him to you.
The Company’s staff have been unremitting in their
effort, both in Australia and overseas. On your behalf I
thank them warmly for their loyal and energetic services.

Big scope for bonuses from
Optical Industries
THIS IS A VITAL year for Optical
Industries Ltd., the bonus-prone owner
of the 90-shop, Australia-wide OPSM
spectacle chain. For this year should
see the first benefits of the company’s
radical moves into safety equipment and
hearing aids, of the move of its head
office, manufacturing units, and bulk
store to new premises, and of the con-
siderable expenditure on exporting its
traditional operations.
For Optical- Industries, soon to
change its name to OPSM Industries
Ltd. to identify itself more closely with
its optical-dispensing, lens-grinding, and
spectacle-making operating subsidiaries,
has done remarkably well out of stick-
ing to eye glasses; earning rates gener-
ally over 30 percent and steadily rising
dividends despite three bonus issues (at
the rate of one-for-five) in the past five
years are testimony of its ability in this
field. And the scope for continued im-
provement in its eye-glasses business
still seems to be there; the increasing
upgrading of the workforce means
that demand for reading aids should
continue to increase at a far greater
rate than population rise. And, in addi-
tion, there is the growing demand for
eyewear as an item of fashion, so that
wearers often have several pairs of
glasses for different occasions.
In deciding to try its hand at the
associated activities of safety equipment
and hearing aids (safety glasses are a
big item) the company was assisted by
its having a large reserve of liquid funds
available following its decision last year
not to proceed with plans to develop
one of its Macquarie Street properties
and to sell it off. So it has bought
heavily into these industries; last year
it spent $220,000 on acquisitions—a
half-interest in an industrial glove
maker (146,000), all the issued shares
of the Audiphone group ($40,000, ex-
cept for the Victorian one which it
bought for $50,110 in September this
year),,as well as a small optical dis-
penser in N.S.W. There are further
moves yet to come in protective safety
equipment, as OPSM is finalising nego-
tiations which will give it access to a
wider range of safety goods and appli-
ances on a national basis.
The moves into these new industries
have also been a major factor in the
$lBO,OOO (or 19 percent) rise in stqcks
and the $45,000 (or 12 percent) rise in
debtors; the company itself points out
that these moves have “required us to
finance trade debtors to a greater de-
gree than previously.” But while these
are expected to pay off in the future
(and the results of rival Protector
Safety Industries Ltd. are sufficient
evidence that excellent profits can be
made from industrial safety equip-
ment), there is no doubt that they had
a dampening effect on the latest result.
In the year to June 30, profits rose
by only 7 percent compared with an
11.2 percent lift in the previous year. It
is true that the costs of moving the
company’s headquarters to the new
premises in Mary Street, Surry Hills,
were met out of profits, but the previ-
ous year’s profits had carried the much
heavier costs of transferring the com-
pany’s manufacturing units and bulk
store. So cost of developing its new
product lines seems largely responsible
for the slower rate of profit growth.
Nevertheless, the profit of $659,476
represented 33.2 percent on capital
(equal to 27.7 percent on enlarged
capital following this month’s one-for-
five bonus issue) after providing sub-
stantially more for depreciation. This
leaves plenty of cover for the 16 per-
cent dividend.
The 1964 bonus was financed from
a $334,000 revaluation of shares in a
subsidiary, Optical Prescription Spec-
tacle Makers Pty. Ltd. Share premium
reserve was the source of the 1962
and 1967 bonuses.
And if all goes even moderately well
with the diversifications, there is plenty
of scope for further bonus issues, even
though the latest one uses up all but
$85,000 of the company’s capital re-
serves. Its assets are no doubt worth
far more than their book values of $2
per $1 share. For example, its 89 per-
cent owned Beanbah Chambers in Mac-
quarie Street is apparently in the books
as worth only $42,700, which signifi-
cantly understates its marketable
value. And its total freeholds are valued

This large swag of freehold prop-
erties all over the country (some out-
lets are rented, but the company pre-
fers the security of freehold premises)
are almost entirely uncluttered by
mortgages. During 1964-65 the company
decided its warehouse, laboratory, and
lens factory in Palmer and Cathedral
Streets, Sydney, was inadequate for its
needs, so built anew in Mary Street,
Surry Hills, and the transfer was com-
pleted in 1965-66. The move naturally
involved heavy outlay in plant, mach-
inery, furniture, and equipment, the
gross cost of which has gone up from
sl.sm. in 1964 to $2.4m. in 1967.
In the year to June 30, 1967, head
office was also transferred to Surry
Hills and the equipment of the lab-
oratories, lens-manufacturing, and en-
gineering divisions deemed completed.
The Palmer Street premises were sold,
but purchase of other freeholds for
dispensing sites obscured their value
and there was a slight reduction in
freeholds and a nominal capital profit
of $4568 net of capital losses. The
commitments for capital expenditure on
freehold properties also indicate the
expansion undertaken by the company;
in 1964 it was $22,000, in 1965
$719,000, in 1966 $234,000, and in 1967
was back to a nominal figure of
$64,000. This year the company should
begin reaping the rewards of this ex-
pansion.
All this rearrangement and consoli-
dation of the company’s production and
administration facilities was effected
without recourse to shareholders, or
long-term lenders on any scale, although
in February, 1965, the company placed
100,000 $1 shares at $4 premium, to
raise $500,000.
Despite its diversifications, the eye-
glasses business will remain the hub
of the company’s business. A factor
accounting for the trebling of profits
in the last decade is probably the sup-
port of the medical profession; doctors
are believed to own a fair proportion
of the capital, and many would
naturally tend to send patients with
prescriptions to OPSM.
The $1 shares offer a very modest 3.7
percent income, and an earnings yield
of 6.4 percent from a purchase at $5.20
cum bonus. But this represents an ex-
bonus price of only $4.33, which is
historically cheap for a stock with pros-
pects of a continued rise in profits and
more bonus issues.

W. R. Carpenter can keep on
lifting the dividend
THE ANNOUNCEMENT of the
death of Mr. R. B. Carpenter, chairman
and managing director of W. R. Car-
penter Holdings Ltd. for 13 years,
preceded the announcement of the first
profit drop in 23 years by 15 days.
The new chairman and managing
director is the younger brother of R. B.
Carpenter, so for the time being the
family dynasty on the board is main-
tained. The original business was vir-
tually founded by the father, Sir Walter
R. Carpenter, and he controlled it for
about 55 years. Both sons were brought
up in the business and it would be diffi-
cult to believe that they were not the
most suited to carry on as senior
administrator.
To most investors, W. R. Carpenter
is the counterpart of Burns Philp, yet
the two companies appear in different
industry classifications in the Sydney
Stock Exchange Index. Burns Philp
considers that it is a trader and conse-
quently its shares are classified in the
trade and services group, but W. R.
Carpenter considers that it is an investor
and its shares appear in the finance
group.
The statistics of the past five years
(to 1966, because the figures of 1967
are not yet available) are as follows:

As at the time of writing this article
only the preliminary profit announce-
ment is available; there is sufficient
indication that earnings per share have
declined for the first time since 1962.
It could be that this is, in fact, the
first time for a much longer period,
but 1962 is the year when accounts
were first produced in accordance with
the new Companies Act. The dividend
rate has been raised, so the indices of
earnings and dividends per share are
as under. I have also included the index
of market growth, which is adjusted for
new issues and based on the average of
the high and low price for the year, with
the exception that the figure for 1967
is the last sale price at the time of
writing, namely, $2.10:
1962 1963 1964 1965 1966 1967
Earnings 100 114 130 151 156 144
Dividends 100 . 130 130 157 1 70 182
Market growth 100 152 174 135 135 117
These figures need a little interpre-
tation. Dividends have continued to
grow steadily. The only year in which
no growth occurred was 1963/4. Earn-
ings per share grew at the rate of 14
percent per annum compound from
1961/2 until 1964/5. In 1965/6, growth
slowed down dramatically to only three
percent and there was a decline in
1966/7. The strange thing is that the
market picked this fall in earnings some
time during 1965 for, during that year
and despite the continuance of the
growth record, the shares were marked
down to $2.05. This is quite unusual,
since in such cases the market price is
often sustained even after the decline
in earnings has become apparent and
the shares are often designated as a
“recovery situation.” Sometimes they
are, often they are not.
What could then have been the
reason for the loss of market prestige by
W. R. Carpenter Holdings Ltd. in 1965?
Profits in that year were well up and
despite the one-for-five bonus issue made
as from April 1, 1965, the earning rate
fell by only five percent. This was
achieved despite a fall in cocoa prices.
The only adverse feature mentioned by
the chairman in his address to share-
holders was the dividend withholding
tax in Fiji and the prospect of a much
reduced milling of copra in that group
of islands.
Those who looked rather more
closely at the annual report would have
noted that: (a) the market value of
investments had fallen by 20 percent,
and (b) the proportion of profit gained
from within Australia had also fallen
again. This last is of interest for two
reasons. If we can assume that, in
quoting this percentage, the company
is basing it on profits before taxation,
depreciation, and amortisation, the fol-
lowing figures can be quoted and an
examination of the accounts for Claude
Neon Industries would reveal the
figures that are also given in the
schedule:
Year to 1963 1964 1965
Ex Australia s'ooo 3609 4418 5324
Australia S'ooo 3716 4262 4200
Claude Neon s'ooo 2686 2934 3096
Claude Neon as % of
Australia 73 69 75
It becomes fairly clear that the
growth has been coming from activities
outside Australia and also that Claude
Neon is a major contributor to the
Australian profit. It could be, then, that
the informed investors had begun to
wonder whether the W. R. Carpenter
group was as widely diversified as they
might have thought originally and
whether it was not too dependent on
one activity for its Australian profits.
It must be stated, however, that, if
one uses the net profit after tax figure,
the percentage is very much reduced

and becomes less than 50 percent in
each of the three years.
Attention has already been drawn
in the statistics to the percentage which
investment income bears to “total in-
come” and in this case also, if invest-
ment income is related to net profit
after tax, the percentage changes quite
markedly. The increase is from 12.1
to 23.5 percent in 1966. This will illus-
trate the difficulty of trying to come
to any conclusion unless the facts are
clearly defined.
The trend in the figures relating to
the investment portfolio is also of
interest:

•Other investments BV 2301 2339 2752 2297 2022
It is clear from these figures that the
investments in listed companies are by
far the major section of the portfolio,
and, in fact, represent about percent
■of the total book value. Looking at the
apparent return on the various types of
investment, it would seem that the
“Other investments” have shown the
best return over the past four years.
Unfortunately, this judgment is based
on a pre-tax return. If it is assumed
that the income from all these “Other
investments” would have been subject
to tax at the average rate paid by the
group and that all the income from the
Investments in “Listed companies” was
tax-free, then there would have been
little to choose between the two forms
of investment.
How one judges success in the
management of investment portfolios
has never been clearly defined. Some
portfolios are designed to produce
income without much concern for capi-
tal gains and some are designed to
produce capital profits. The yield from
W. R. Carpenter’s portfolio of listed
companies’ investments has been fairlv
constant at about 5-| percent for the
past three years. So far as capital gain
is concerned, at June 30, 1963, the
market value was 38 percent greater
than the book value, while at June 30,
1966, it was only 12 percent greater.
At the present time, W. R. Car-
penter’s shares are selling at 14 times
latest earnings and show a dividend
yield of 3.8 percent. The dividend rate
was increased in 1966/7 despite the fall
in earnings, and, on average, over the
past five years dividends per share have
increased at 12 percent per annum
•compound. Even if there w'ere no fur-
ther increases in earnings per share the
company could easily maintain this rate
of increase for the next five years.
It will be interesting to see which
particular source of profits ex-
Australia, Australia, or the investment
portfolio—was responsible for the per
share earnings drop in 1966/7, and,
perhaps, a better judgment of likely
future trends can be made when the
1967 annual report is available.

Mining
EZ Industries: a miner
of some standing
IN THE MOOD OF the market at
present, when exploration programs are
fetching such high premiums, EZ In-
dustries seems to be only just catching
the attention of those investors who like
a goodly portion of money spent on
exploration by the larger mining com-
panies cum metal investment houses. It
took Western Mining’s nickel discovery
to awaken interest in the enormous
future that could be the result of the
systematic and extensive exploration
programs maintained by such heavy-
weights as North Broken Hill Limited
or Broken Hill South Limited. And,
of course,’the latter company has been
rewarded by the discovery of its enor-
mous phosphate deposits in North
Queensland. Only a year ago, or less,
both of these companies were looked
upon as base-metal producers whose
fluctuating mining profits were bolstered
by the income from large investment
portfolios. They were essentially regard-
ed as cyclical metal stocks following the
trend of base-metal prices.
On the tried and true formula of
buying such shares when metal prices
are down and selling when metal
prices rise, there must have been quite
a few investors who were waiting for
lead and zinc prices to reach even
lower levels following their continuous
decline after peak prices were reached
on world markets in the second half
of 1964. Lead and zinc prices have cer-
tainly continued to ease back since that
time, but this time the contra-cyclical
theory has not worked. In fact it is
remarkable that Australian base-metal
stocks are at record high prices at a
time when the outlook for base metal
prices is anything but optimistic. It is
interesting to speculate on what levels
share prices would reach should base-
metal price rises be added to the
current market prices, which are based
on the potential of exploration pro-
grams.
It is only since EZ Industries a few
days ago announced that it would be
taking a closer look at the old Montana
Silver Lead NL company’s (now wound
up) former leases that the market has
shown real signs of interest in the com-
pany on its exploration prospects. The
word “nickel” has mighty connota-
tions.
Perhaps EZ has never been as glamor-
ous as the other barrier companies;
after all, it does not stand to benefit
overmuch from high metal prices (or
to suffer large falls in profit when metal
prices decline). This at least seems to
have been the market’s attitude to the
company for many years, and it has
been only in the past couple of years
that EZ’s status as an industrial com-
pany, and its listing among the indus-
trial shares rather than the mining list
on the Stock Exchange, has been
thought to be rather curious. At its
mines on the west coast of Tasmania
the orebody is among the richest in
Australia. In addition to lead and zinc,
it contains good quantities of copper,
gold, and silver. The richness of this
ore may be seen by comparison with,
say; Broken Hill South’s mines at
Broken Hill and Cobar:
EZI BH South
Lead 5.4% 11.7%
Zinc 17.6% 10.7%
Silver 6.280z./ton 6.60z./ton
Copper .56% 2.2%
Gold 2.16dwt./ton
Compare the gold content of the EZ
ore with the 2.67dwt./ton being mined
at present at its Mt. Charlotte mine
by Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie (Aus-
tralia) Ltd. With an annual through-
put of 300,000 tons of this type of ore,
there can be no doubt as to the posi-
tion of EZ as a miner of some stand-
ing. And like its other Collins House
cousins, it spends quite a deal of money
on exploration outside of its mining
areas. During the year which ended
last June the company budgeted for
expenditure of $750,000 on exploration,
and in the previous year expenditure
on its own projects and in joint ventures
with other companies cost approxi-
mately $600,000.
Apart from the areas surrounding its
mines in Tasmania, the company is
prospecting for tin and phosphate in
off-shore areas from the coast of Tas-
mania as a member of a syndicate con-
sisting of Anglo-American Corporation
of South Africa Limited, the Consoli-
dated Mines Selection Company
Limited, the Bethlehem Steel Corpora-
tion, Ocean Science and Engineering
Inc., and Ocean Mining AG.
On the mainland the company holds
an exploration licence over 110 square
miles in the vicinity of Port Macquarie,
where diamond drilling is being under-

taken. Drilling operations have also
been carried out in a large area of
south-eastern New South Wales, which
includes the old Captain’s Elat base-
metal mine. In Western Australia, EZ is
drilling for phosphate north of Gerald-
ton, and is interested in several mineral
claims near Geraldton likely to contain
heavy minerals such as ilmenite.
In the past year uranium seems to
have had a special attraction for the
company, and an exploration program
was commenced in conjunction with the
local subsidiary of Newmont Mining of
the U.S.A. in an area of about 920
square miles north-east of Adelaide.
Last September, EZ and Newmont, to-
gether with Peko-Wallsend Invest-
ments, formed a joint venture for the
exploration of uranium and other
minerals in the Northern Territory.
This consortium is to earn an aggre-
gate interest of 40 percent in United
Uranium’s leases at South Alligator and
Pandanus Creek in the Northern Ter-
ritory after the completion of a pro-
gram ending in 1970, costing $1.2
million.
Earlier in the year, EZ and Peko
came to an agreement to undertake
joint exploration programs in all north
Australian leases held by each company,
excluding Peko’s areas in the immediate
vicinity of Tennant Creek.
In addition to these areas, the com-
pany has programs with North Broken
Hill and Broken Hill South Limited in
respect of areas at Broken Hill and in
other parts of South Australia, New
South Wales, and Queensland, and to
complete the picture it also has off-
shore oil and gas leases covering an
area of some 8000 squares miles in the
south-east of Tasmania, covering
Hobart and Risdon and extending out
to sea.
The agreement with Newmont and
Peko will cost the company $400,000
over the next three years, and with
current expenditure at around $750,000
per annum, the company’s exploration
budget this year should be in the
vicinity of $1 million. This compares
very favorably with other companies—
about the same as Broken Hill South
and above the $700,000 expenditure by
North Broken Hill (listed companies
spending more are CRA, Mount Isa
Mines, and BHP). While EZ has twice
as many shares issued as North Broken
Hill and 50 percent more than Broken
Hill South, its expenditure on explora-
tion on a per share basis falls behind
that of these companies; nevertheless,
with such a solid base for earnings
from zinc refining at its plant in Ris-
don, and its profitable mining opera-
tions on the west coast of Tasmania
(which incidentally do not suffer the
high rates of royalty carried by these
two Barrier companies), it is some-
what surprising that it has taken the
market so long to accord the company
a real place in the ranks of developers.

The good and the bad for nickel
EXAMINING THE possible demand
situation for nickel, the London
“Economist” concludes that companies
like Western Mining, with new pro-
duction coming in now, are “well
enough” placed. They are probably not
too bound to the producer price. Of
course, with the immediate supply
shortage, it is almost a truism
for WMC’s chairman, Mr. Lindesay
Clark, to observe that his company
expects no difficulty in disposing of
all production “at satisfactory prices.”
Over the next five years or so the
world supply position seems fairly well
predictable. So future price levels
clearly depend on the rate of increase
in demand. At the moment, stock
shortages and an absence of American
stockpile metal mean that the free mar-
ket, largely drawing on Russian exports
and scrap, has reached levels more than
twice the big producers’ price of
£stg.773£ a ton.
If the current rate of demand in-
crease prevails, it must take years for
prices to move down to any extent.
The past four years have seen the
Iron and steel industries taking con-
siderably more nickel to make stain-
less and constructional alloy steels.
Almost certainly the present growth
rate cannot be sustained at existing
price levels, so its 15 percent yearly
extension could lapse to between 6£
and percent. That lower rate sug-
gests surplus production by 1970; the
higher rate gives a risky balance.
Those are the most pessimistic
assumptions, further bedevilled by fears
of substitution by plastics and the use
of other alloys. If they are real, the
“Economist” remarks, “shares like that
of Inco (International Nickel), using
present profits to bring in massive new
production in the next few years, are
at unsustainable levels, and most of the
present Western Australian dream
shares, dependent on future production,
.may turn into nightmares.”
Yet it is equally feasible to maintain
that immediate trends in nickel usage
can continue. The United States now
uses 50 percent more nickel per ton
of steel than most of the rest of the
world and the rest generally follow the
United States. Stainless steel, too,
looks like keeping itself a growth item
for the next 10 years or so. Significantly,
too, nickel is such a small constituent of
stainless steel that £lOO a ton increase
in its price can be offset by a 30s. fall
in iron.
That kind of optimistic outlook
probably justifies the good cheer sur-
rounding nickel shares. And, although
they constitute a rival to Western Min-
ing’s ambitions, the massive programs
to develop Rhodesia’s nickel resources
illustrate that producers are reasonably
hitching themselves to optimism.
The Rhodesian mining and refining
complex is being developed by Anglo
American Corporation at a cost of
£stglom. It could in five years become
the world’s third-biggest producer
after Inco and France’s Le Nickel.
Possibly four mines could eventually
be brought into production: the first
two may achieve an output of 100,000
tons of ore a month. That would give
7500 tons of nickel a year, to compare
with WMC’s initially planned 5000
tons.
AUSTRALIAN COPPER producers
last week lifted the price of their metal
by $l5O to $ll5O a ton. This, the
second rise in two weeks, brings the
producer price just $lOO under the peak
$1250 set when producer control was
re-established 15 months ago. London
Metal Exchange spot prices put on a
net £stg.lo| last week to reach
(for wire bars), while three months
forward prices were quoted at nearly
£stg.462.
The American strike still completely
overhangs the market, which has been
further complicated by the Zambian
companies’ suspension of shipments
through Kalanga to Angola and con-
siderable confusion ,on whether the
Chilean miners will strike or not.
Over 90 percent of American produc-
tive capacity is stopped and about one-
third of fabricating output. Kennecott’s
president, Mr. Frank Milliken, declared
only a few days ago that “despite
numerous bargaining meetings and the
mediation efforts of various Govern-
ment agencies, both Federal and State,
there is no sign of an early settlement.”
Within America the producers’ fixed
price basis has been tacitly, if not
openly, abandoned. The LME has come
out openly to declare expectation of a
tight position over the next few weeks
and sounds fearful of a squeeze similar
to last May’s occurring.

It’s been rather a relief to observe a wider and keener in-
terest spreading among industrials, even if those with some kind
of a mining tag are naturally first in demand. But a mid-week
splurge held practically to the end. Thiess .caught many eyes,
managing to close 67 cents higher at $3.55; CSR also put on
41 cents to reach $5.04. Of the regulars, BHP added a further
25 cents and Western Mining climbed to a peak $28.50 by
means of a net 60-cent advance. EZ Industries gained 52 cents,
finishing at $3.45. The National Bank rose 35 cents, Ampol

THE LAND
The Wool Board re-opens an
old, old debate
IT IS HARDLY possible that peace,
or indeed a solution of any of their
major problems, can come to wool-
growers as a result of the Australian
Wool Board’s new report on marketing.
The Australian Wool Industry Confer-
ence will resume formal debate of the
report on February 14; dissension
among individual growers and their
organisations is already apparent. An
argument without satisfactory conclu-
sions looks likely to continue for quite
a while yet.
Notwithstanding its defeat on the re-
serve-price referendum in 1965, the
Board is undoubtedly still wedded to
the overall philosophy of reserve prices.
It has perhaps modified the scheme to
overcome one glaring example of fail-
ure: the dismal collapse of the attempt
to shore up prices in New Zealand. The
Board’s answer is to abandon the notion
of fixing a reserve price for a whole
season. But in conferring upon the
proposed marketing authority a flexi-
bility to vary its reserve price from day
to day, surely the Board at the same
time removes the power to act as a
price stabiliser, even in the short term.
Little is done to tackle the over-
riding pressure upon growers the
notorious costs-prices squeeze. Nervous
about the necessary market mechanism
of fluctuation, the Board declares:
‘‘There appears to be no solution to
the problems of short-term price fluctu-
ations that arise under the auction sys-
tem unless some attempt is made to
regulate the supply of wool to the de-
mand for it.”
Not without reason, Mr. S. C. Burs-
ton, in his minority report, draws atten-
tion to the “fallibility of human judg-
ment to predict changes in interna-
tional economic activity and in price
levels.” Mr. Burston asserts that “it is
a display of arrogance to propose not
only that a statutory authority should
be empowered to intrude into the
whole business of wool handling, but
also indulge in what is described as a
system of supply management.” He
maintains forcefully that the Australian
growing costs are a problem to be
solved by woolgrowers and their gov-
ernments and not the responsibility of
any overseas processors who purchase
the clip.
This scheme of supply management
would of course lead to the formation
of a stockpile, although the Board
carefully avoids emphasising this. The
marketing authority is given power
“should ruling prices, in the authority’s
opinion, be at unreasonably low levels
(to) instruct brokers to make appro-
priate withdrawals from sale. The lots
so withdrawn from the market would
be released when price levels im-
proved.” The authority thus becomes
another trader, with its day-to-day tech-
nique, trying to play the market, buy-
ing low and selling -high to even out
price fluctuations and to make a trad-
ing profit.
The old philosophy, in slightly new
disguise, evidently prevails two years
after its previous defeat. In spite, too,
of the calls for co-operation from other
important sections of the wool industry,
the Board appears to approach every-
thing by assuming solutions always in
terms of the autonomy of the growers.
That is a tired and outworn habit
which should be quickly a’dying, the
attitude of men who will not adopt
their thoughts to changing industrial
conditions. At the most charitable in-
terpretation, this autonomous outlook
may perhaps appeal to the small
grower, keen perhaps to have a big-
brother board looking after him. And,
of course this fond measure of consider-
tion may well reconcile the smaller
grower when the Board’s other hand
makes its rather sizable demands for
promotion moneys.
At the present moment it is becom-
ing more and more necessary for
grower organisations to learn to ex-
amine the attitudes of major consumers.
Just before the conference met, Japan
and the Common Market countries
(represented by the Interlaine organ-
isation) issued warnings against arbi-
trary artificial interference with the free
auction system. Interlaine pleads with
“leaders” in the producing countries to
help put an end to uncertainties of
supply and to intervention in the free
flow of wool “in a climate of re-
ciprocal understanding.” The message
is that growers can’t go it alone, or
even with the help of their govern-
ments.

Wheat harvests may be planned
SOMETHING FEARED for some
time has now been announced bluntly
and precisely by the Australian Wheat
Board: the forthcoming harvest will
yield only about 240 million bushels
for sale. Last year’s crop was a record
462 million bushels. The year before,
the harvest was only on a par with what
it is expected to amount to this year.
Last year several important world pro-
ducers had harvests smaller than
average. Consequently, we managed to
sell most of our bumper crop without
great difficulty. The year before, when
other countries had more or less average
crops, room enough remained on the
market for our relatively frugal offer-
ing. This year India says she will not
be a considerable importer. Russia has
had a good season, too. In North
America the crops were bountiful and
Mexico has once again produced much
more than her own requirements. The
Jeremiahs are beginning to say that
falling world wheat prices are a dis-
tinct possibility.
Appreciably greater acreages were
planted inWustralia this season. Seizing
on this and the fact that we still had
sizable carry-over stocks, some wise-
heads up till a couple of weeks ago
were predicting a disposal problem and
urging controls and retrenchment in our
wheat industry. Now their words are
wind, as drought has halved the harvest
and demonstrated once again that it is
still impossible to plan or manipulate
agriculture. In this connection, and to
complete the picture of current world
production, it is worth reporting that
an American assessment put Mainland
China’s crop much below average. This
estimate was based on a survey con-
ducted by satellites equipped with infra-
red cameras.
Accordingly, Chinese bidding might
yet bolster the market and our con-
signments to it during 1968 might be
even smaller than the recent figures
promise. If the drought persists
through next autumn —statistical evi-
dence suggests that this is the more
likely eventuality—the Board may have
to increase still further the provision
it has already made for domestic needs.
The question of silo space, which also
provoked alarm earlier, can now be
appraised more soberly.

crops it may become possible to plan
the size of the harvest to a certain
extent. Ways of getting more water into
the soil and keeping it there until
needed by the crop are now better
understood than formerly. The greater
the amount of water held in the soil,
the less dependent the crop is on sea-
sonal rain. It is also now realised that
plants need water for cooling rather
than growing and use it lavishly to make
themselves as comfortable as possible.
With human-like frailty, in this
regard, they spend wildly and make
themselves much more comfortable
than they really need to be. Waxy
sprays such as cetyl alcohol and
compounds like plastic can be applied
to give plants waterproof coats. Other
chemicals, such as phenyl mercuric
acetate, cause plants to close their
transpiration pores. Yield increases of
up to 10 percent have been obtained
with these sprays on wheat plots in
England, and experiments are being
conducted here. No results have been
announced yet, but it is apparent that
even modest success would mitigate the
effects of drought. A few years ago a
CSIRO team tried these anti-
transpirants on cotton and cut down
water consumption by the plants
considerably.
Mr. J. E. Schultz, soils research offi-
cer with the South Australian Depart-
ment of Agriculture, has recently men-
tioned another new approach to re-
ducing water loss from soil. He has
been applying a “chemical mulch” to
dry out the surface soil quickly. Water
evaporates rapidly from soil when it
can move up to the surface in liquid
form but very slowly in the vapor form
—the only way by which it can move
in dry soil. Moreover, chemically
mulched soil, like any mulch, absorbs
rain faster and so there is less run-off.
In a test with a stubble mulch fallow
at Parafield, 3.6 inches of water escaped
during the four-month period, October
to January, but 4.4 inches were lost
from a bare fallow.
Mr. Schultz has also found that a
wheat crop in the seedling stage uses
less than eight points of water a day,
but up to 18 points a day during the
heading and flowering stages of growth
in September-October. Other studies
are showing how much water different
types of soils hold and what fraction
of this the wheat plants can extract.
Since a wheat crop uses about 1000
tons of water to produce one ton of
grain, and since this water must come
from the amount stored in the soil or
from rain during the growing season,
it is possible to calculate at sowing
time what the yield will be for any
given rainfall. It is conceivable, there-
fore, that the day will come when a
farmer will be able to send in particu-
lars about his paddocks, treatment of
fallows, rainfall record, etc., and be told
by computer what his crop will prob-
ably yield.

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
An audio-tactile man
By SANDRA HALL
THE SOUNDS vibrating from the
stereo and disseminating across the
Kings Cross rooftops in the afternoon
heat were without musical reference.
Experience in pure sound.
Johnny Sangster doesn’t need refer-
ences. He is Marshall McLuhan’s dream
of the audio-tactile man, worshipping
the twin gods of spontaneity and total
involvement.
His has been a name on the Sydney
jazz scene for a long time now, first
as a trumpeter and drummer with
Graeme Bell’s band in the booming
days of trad jazz, most recently as an
inventive percussionist, whose music
pops up in everything from “the toilet
paper commercials” to a concert organ-
ised by the Art Gallery Society. But
among the small group of Sydney’s
hard-working studio musicians grasping
to play “their kind of music” whenever
they can, Sangster has earned the
reputation of being farther out than
most.
This reputation has been enlarged
lately with the completion of a com-
position commissioned by the Aus-
tralian Performing Rights Association,
his Saturday-night excursions into
psychedelia at the El Rocco, and his
new LP, “The Trip.”
The record is a kind' of one-man
show in sound. He plays 26 different
percussion instruments on it, possible
because the tracks were put down
separately over three months and finally
mixed by the record’s producer, Pat
Aulton.
“I’ve been trying for years to get
■someone to let me do this sort of record.
Then Festival agreed a few months ago.
The only stipulation they made was
that I do well-known songs which have
made the hit parades. At first, I
thought, ‘What a drag!’ But then I
started really listening to these songs.
And I’ve come to the conclusion that
the most exciting things in the past few
years have been done in the pop field.
“For instance, the Beatles have made
-an audience for jazz. At the El Rocco
we get the long-haired kids coming in
kids from the pop groups who come
to see what we’re doing.”
While other jazz musicians talk of
the lack of stimulation and experimen-
tation in Sydney and think of going
abroad, Sangster is happy where he is.
One can see why all the experimen-
tation he needs is going on in his own
mind. “Hear that sound. The ABC let
me get inside one of their Steinway
grands with a mallet to produce that.
It’s not new, of course. Other people
have done it. But I’ve often thought to
myself there’s that huge instrument
standing there. And the only part people
ever use are the little black and white
bits. A violin, too. You can get jazz out
of that by using the strings on the
other side of the bridge.”
Appropriately, Sangster lives in a
small flat on the roof of the building
which houses the El Rocco. There are
carvings on the wall, an incessantly
ringing telephone, a set of marimbas in
a corner, an Indian sitar resting on top
Sangster .... shortening the time lag
of it, and in another corner the stereo
and the tape-recorder with their unpre-
dictable sounds.
“You know,” Sangster said, eyes
amused above the beard, “a lot of
people don’t know how to take this
stuff. Some of them are frightened by it
and others think they have to look
terribly intense about it. They don’t—
because it’s fun. You use concrete
sounds, like fire-engine sirens, bird
sounds, anything. It’s direct, quicker
expression without too much planning
or thought.
“That’s what I liked so much about
Dixieland —the musicians really seemed
to enjoy what they were doing. The
‘cool’ musicians are sometimes too cool,
as if it’s a crime to show any feeling.
Trad jazz taught me a lot of things.”
Nevertheless, with his psychedelic
experiments with taped music and film
he’s come a long way from his Graeme
Bell days. “They’re doing fantastic
psychedelic concerts in America
because they have the equipment. One
group has 29 film projectors. When I
went to Expo recently I spent some
time in New York and went to a con-
cert at a place called ‘The Electric
Circus.’
“Admission was $2.50, or 10 cents
without shoes, so natur-
ally you took your
shoes off. Then you
were given a plastic
bowl and a spoon and
sent through a series of
rooms aimed to dis-
orient you. The first
was a kind of Luna
Park plaqe. You had to
fight your way through
a rubber jungle in a
dark room. You passed
from that into another
dark room, the door
was locked and you
just sat down to calm
down. Then into the
concert.
“There were lights
going, tapes with other
sounds, a deafening
bombardment. And the
smell of incense every-
where. And in the
middle of the room
was a huge bowl of
red jelly. That’s what
the bowl and spoon
were for. A complete
assault on sight, ear,
taste, and smell. And
it really worked. Fan-
tastic, gripping you
and turning your mind
round and round. It's
logical, too, when you
think about it. People
have sat sedately for too long in concert
halls.
“With this kind of music there are
so many things coming at you that you
are forced to reject some of them—edit
them out. So you’re participating. If
people can get into a frame of mind
they haven’t been in before or think
thoughts they haven’t thought before
with my music, then I’m satisfied.”
Right now, Sangster is searching for

two things a group of dancers able
to improvise to improvised music and
a poet with the ability to do the same.
He has already done some splendidly
funny music to an Edward Lear non-
sense poem in the ABC’s “Nocturne”
series.
It’s been a good year for Sangster,
a year in which things have started to
happen, and it will be climaxed on De-
cember 1 with the release of the Aus-
tralian Performing Rights Association’s
record of the jazz works it has com-
missioned. Sangster, Don Burrows, Judy
Bailey, and Bernie McGann have each
done a 12-minute piece.
In Sangster’s piece, “Conjurman,
Conjurman” (“it’s meant in the sense
■of witch-doctor, priest, psychiatrist”),
he has tried to improvise as much as
possible while still giving APRA what
it wanted a composition. “Each of
the eight musicians I used had a graph,
with signposts to show where the
character of the music would change
or another musician would enter. I told
them the mood of the piece and how
the melody should go and they im-
provised from there.”
Sangster was 12 when he began to be
interested in music, inspired by listening
to Graeme Bell on a crystal set
smuggled in under the bedclothes. At
38, he has $5OOO worth of percussion
instruments and the same enthusiasm he
must have had at 12. As the interview
ended he was saying with elation, “You
know, McLuhan writes of the time lag
between the avant garde and public
acceptance. Andy Warhol is a great
example.
“And that time lag is getting shorter
all the time. Imagine if there gets
to be no time lag in my lifetime. Then
it’d be marvellous.”
Films
An forworn's London
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
Blow Up. Director, Michelangelo
Antonioni.
The Honeypot. Director, Joseph L.
Mankiewicz.
I’VE ALWAYS been a rather unwilling
fan of Antonioni, beguiled by the visual
beauty of his films and the hypnotic
rhythm of their development, even when
exasperated by their slow tempo and
chilly lack of passion. But there have
been hints of a growing sterility of
inspiration, a boring tendency to
repetition. “Blow Up,” I’m happy to
say, comes triumphantly to life.
Perhaps all Antonioni needed was to
get out of his own backyard. Certainly
Italy is a picturesque backyard, but its
paths were getting trodden into ruts.
Now he brings a fresh and alert eye
to modern London, casting a sharp,
unsentimental, foreigner’s eye on it, and
is himself stimulated to fresh approaches
to his theme, which is still his obsessive
one of non-involvement, lack of com-
munication, the insidious manner in
which a civilised detachment can de-
velop inter total alienation from life.
But here it is stated not in the usual
negative, allusive way but clearly and
positively.
For the first time Antonioni tells his
story from a male viewpoint, that of
a young, successful fashion photog-
rapher protected from reality by a
cocoon of easy success, easy popularity,
easy girls. Even the pictures he takes
for a projected book on the real
London see misery, despair, and
poverty from the purely decorative
angle. He accepts unquestionably the
modish values, though they are
ultimately unsatisfying: the aeroplane
propeller bought as a chic conversation
piece turns into a dust-collecting
nuisance, the fragment of a pop-
musician’s guitar, fought for at a beat
club riot, is thrown carelessly away as
soon as possession has been established.
Strolling in a quiet park, he sees
a man and woman kissing, and takes
pictures which may be useful for his
book. The woman’s unaccountable
anxiety to get the film sets him won-
dering; he develops and enlarges the
pictures and begins to suspect that he
may have witnessed a murder. The
man who had previously (like An-
tonioni himself?) seen everything
through a camera lens is suddenly in
the middle of violent reality. Dis-
turbed and excited, he tries to involve
himself more directly, but is unable.
At the end he has admitted failure,
embraced illusion, gone back to life
at one remove.
The director’s use of the color
camera to underline and emphasise is
original, exciting, yet always discreet.
The performances, particularly that of
David Hemmings, are excellent, but
this is always a director’s picture; and,
as well as making some very positive
statements about life in general and
“swinging London” in particular, An-
tonioni gives delightful proof of a
vein of quirky humor only hinted at
in his previous films.
There’s some charming color photog-
raphy in “The Honeypot,” too the
combination of Venice and Gianni di
Venanzo is practically foolproof but
it’s a very odd and unsatisfactory film,
indeed, a sad comedown from the
maker of “All About Eve” and “Julius
Caesar.” Mankiewicz wrote the screen-
play himself, and there are some biting
and funny lines, to be sure; but he has
never, it seems, made up his mind just
what sort of a picture it was going to
be. So sometimes it is a comedy of man-
ners, sometimes a philosophical dis-
cussion of good and evil, or again a
straight, old-fashioned detective story
with much boring discussion of where
everyone was at the time of the
murder.
Sometimes the pace slows to such
an extent that one expects the film
to start running backwards, especially
when Mankiewicz explains for the
umpteenth time that the plot is a
modern version of “Volpone” he is
snobbishly convinced that not only has
his audience never heard of “Volpone”
or even Jonson, but won’t understand
them anyway.
Rex Harrison, Susan Hayward, and
Edie Adams do a good deal to enlivu
this muddle of a picture they’ve
got the best lines, too but Cliff
Robertson is hampered by a soundtrack
which, while being unhelpful to the
whole cast, transforms his usually clear
enunciation into a baritone gargle.
Music
Out of season
By PAUL FROLICH
Sydney Symphony Orchestra, conduc-
tor Franz-Paul Decker, soloist Kerstin
Meyer. Town Hall, Sydney.
VERY HOT day, sticky. Showered,
dressed, went to Sydney Town Hall.
Idiotic; very hot night, Town Hall tem-
perature 90deg. Last subscription con-
cert for the year, one-third of seats
empty. Good assortment of fans:
paper, lace, ivory, wood, plastic. Good
turn-out of coughers. Sydney Symphony
Orchestra, conductor Franz-Paul
Decker, Swedish mezzo-soprano Kerstin
Meyer; other soloists, fire-engines,
ambulances, hot-rods, fine range of car
horns. Other soloists, fans, coughers
always audible. Principal soloist not
always, audible. Blame acoustics.
“Little Music for Strings,” opus 16,
by Alexander Goehr, written 1963 for
Lucerne Festival Strings. Pleasant
music, not much excitement, mostly
Frank Bridge style, from elegiac to
energetic. Goehr can be more interest-
ing, stimulating. Lassitude not eased by
this music, but Decker well in control
and strings very good, especially celli.
Getting warmer still: lushly romantic
Poeme de I’Amour et de la Mer by
Chausson. Very beautiful music, rarely
heard. Orchestra quite excellent, includ-
ing fine soli by cellist Lois Simpson,
bassoonist Glen Spicer. Kerstin Meyer
great dramatic singer, fine actress;
heard her in opera at Salzburg Festival.
Chausson not her cup of tea. Baritone
voice better for this cycle. Reminded
of Berlioz’ Nuits d’ete, Berlioz better
suited for female voice. Orchestral
score very colorful and carnal, should
be heard on cold night. Last song, “Le
temps des Lilas,” most enjoyable, best
showing by Miss Meyer.
Interval. No air, no cold drink. Went


back inside; idiotic. Lovely early Haydn
symphony, No. 22, nicknamed “Philoso-
pher.” Strings, horns, cor anglais;
unique tonal coloring, very charming
music. Decker’s interpretation a little
refined, tempi rather slow. Too many
fiddles for real precision. Why not
smaller band? At last, Presto Finale at
a good clip. Pity players; hot work!
Sympathetic ladies fan madly. Last
work Stravinsky’s “Firebird” Suite.
Recurrent obbligato from fire-engines.
Brilliant music, wild swirls of brass
color. Orchestra excellent. Decker, Ger-
man, domiciled in Holland, very good
conductor. Percussion and others mak-
ing very fine noise. Opening section true
ping-pong stereo effect. All fine, good
clean fun, but delicious Lullaby best of
all. Lady in front succumbed. Rudely
awakened by bass drum crash; blushes.
Concert finished early. Bless ABC.
Emerged from Town Hall. Outside just
as hot. Season finished.
Art
Honor due
By ELWYN LYNN
Ralph Balson. Paintings, 1939-1964.
Gallery A, Sydney.
WISE-AFTER-THE-EVENT commen-
tators have been noting the neglect
accorded Ralph Balson, who died in
1964: Once, the neglect-syndrome,
characteristic of those who have a
patronage-consumer view of art’s effects,
bolstered by tales of Van Gogh, equated
art with lack of recognition, but, in these
days of instant reputation, early recog-
nition and avidity for the novel—all
legitimate enough with so much ex-
pendable talent around—some are sur-
prised that art can remain an under-
ground movement. A recent example
is that of Kurt Schwitters, whose 40-
year devotion to small collages of every-
day debris only became known and
appreciated with the revival of Dada,
a revival, ironically enough, coinciding
with Bernard Smith’s Antipodean
Manifesto of 1959 which pronounced
Dada as dead as the Dodo. Amen.
There is now haste to lay a belated
wreath, both laurel and funeral, on Bal-
son’s achievement, but he was not really
neglected, or simply acknowledged with
a nod, in his lifetime, for his “under-
ground” art often surfaced significantly.
His paintings toured the U.K. in the
British Arts Council selection of 1953
in the company of Dobell, Drysdale,
Nolan, Rees, Arthur Boyd, Hinder, and
Miller; he was included in the Orient
Line travelling show of 1956 at a time
when Bob Dickerson, at the peak of his
.early period, was deliberately excluded;
he found a kindred soul in Klippel,
with whom he shared a show in 1952,
and had a one-man show in Paris in
1961. Though not in the Mertz Collec-
tion, he is in most others of importance;
he is treated in books by John Pringle,
Bernard Smith, and John Reed, the last
including a valuable statement by Bal-
son—one of those that scholars, with
their own theories, find awkward.
Daniel Thomas’ essay in “Art and Aus-
tralia” (March, 1965) came after his
death, but shows how alive Balson was
in people’s minds. Yet it’s only with the
sympathetic selection and hanging ill
the refurbished Gallery A that one
begins to appreciate Balson’s stature.
Why?
There is skilful pruning of 54 works
from 1939 to 1964; only one Pollock-
like work of yellow pouring over blue
is shown and there are only three of
his wrinkled poured enamel works from
1960 to 1961—crusty white islands
lassoed with white skeins, some free
floating, red, biomorphic forms and, in
1961, powerful flooding areas that make
one wonder if he saw works by the
Japanese Imai and Motonaga in Paris.
There is only one work of poured black
and white enamel, employing his “prin-
ciple of indeterminacy”; a room full of
them did rather resemble a series of
dark marble tables for funeral feasts.
The selection, concentrating on the
more restless, splendidly fragmented
works, exaggerates the sense of Balson’s
ceaseless probing, an approach much
esteemed at present; and Balson did
excellent work at every phase of his ,
development. Again, his quest has
parallels with that of young painters
who are extending their concepts of
hard-edge by , looking back to the
’twenties and ’thirties, of which Balson
was a more immediate heir, because,
between 1939 and 1953, he practised
flat form analysis, overlapping trans-
parent planes, as in a Feininger, and
used a sourly bright color, just
canonised in the recent U.S. show. He
did not drown in formless tachist pools,
and despite his “principle of indeter-
minacy” stressed painting’s infra-
structure and its connection with “the
rhythm and relativity of the universe.”
His pointillism and fractured surfaces
were about flux and he sought to pre-
sent both its fluidity and density. He
did not like the idea of art as iconic
structure or as a repository of readily
recognisable associations, like Olsen’s;
he implied that painting was more than
a Sunday stroll or ecstatic romp
through nature.
Still, he shared with Olsen, whose
notion of going for a walk with a
line he did not care for, a feeling of
the flux of reality, or, at least, of its
surface. Whereas Godfrey Miller in-
clined to Buddhist notions of reality’s
cohesion beneath the chaotic surface,
Balson, like so many younger artists
today, preferred to look to science, and
certainly it is his conceptual, anti-
expressive, anti-mystical approach that
makes him so contemporaneous. He has
no concept of art as language; Fair-
weather’s painting suggests that break-
ing his calligraphic code might reveal
the message, but Balson’s “writing,”
horseshoe-shaped swirls in 1959, whip-
ping, criss-crossed strokes or showers of
chaff in 1957, is meshed with move-
ments below.
His last phase grows out of delicate
pointillist works of 1955-56 and a
tightly knit Cezannism, with references
to pinkish-white blossoms and lettuce-
green. These can be rather busy and
it is not until 1958 to 1964 that he
gets somethijjg of that Eastern con-
templative ease that he shares with
Williams and Fairweather, though what
Balson achieves is an intimate grandeur.
In 1958 he painted a meal-drift of
soft-edged oblongs of pale fawn, purple,,
rose, grey, and a host of indeterminate
colors that emphasise the lack of focus
and the gentle, overall pulsation with r
here and there, a shiver as if a bine
wren had touched the foliage. In com-
parison, Mark Tobey is a fanciful
embroiderer.
The drifting fragility of this work
(Non-Objective Painting, 24) is
replaced in 1964 by an ornate, pyro-
technical display of fractured verticals,
of purples, greens, reds, and yellows
where the infrastructure lies close to
the thick, matted surface. Here he
comes closest to relating the rhythms of
his “universe” to “the substance of
paint.”
From 1959 he was producing major
works, contributions whose significance
goes beyond Australia, and was show-
ing how basic structure and elaborated
surfaces signify the real life of art;
his was an art of the unemphatic, of
the sheer insistence of delicacy, and
of the painting as aesthetic object
rather than a demonstration of
aesthetic principles.
The exhibition should be seen, and
one looks forward to Mr. Hutchison’s
next selection from the estate, and
looks aside, uneasily, for the painters-
today not receiving their due honors.
Sound, and image
Flanders Field
in Adelaide
By ROBERT WARD
War Requiem. Sound and image pre-
sentation by Derek Jolly. Bonython
Hall, Adelaide.
DEREK JOLLY’S audio-visual pre-
sentation of Benjamin Britten’s “War
Requiem” took place in Adelaide Uni-
versity’s grandiose gothic incrustation,
Bonython Hall, circa 1936. The hall is
the delight of all tourists bent on a
nice slide collection, and so it was not
inappropriate that the authorities
allowed Mr. Jolly to use it for his (to
be sure, sophisticated) amalgamation
of hi-fi and slides.
In Adelaide, the audio-visual pre-
sentation has been with us for some
time. Stan Ostoja-Kotkowski and Mr.
Jolly developed the technique over the


past decade, and at several Festivals
the city has been treated to “sound and
image” spectaculars. In these, Mr.
Kotkowski threw a great variety of
colored shapes and patterns on a screen,
and with the aid of several fader
boxes blended and witched them to
electronic music, computerised poetry,
modern dance, and, in fact, the whole
psychedelic bag of gestalt tricks. The
result was visually dramatic, and the
images produced were often very beauti-
ful.
Mr. Jolly’s technique is much more
representational. He endeavors to com-
bine the best of hi-fi with straight-
forward emotive or expressionist
slides, fading them into each
other and occasionally matching
the theme and tempo of the
music.
For the “War Requiem,” the
British Museum provided a col-
lection of splendid black-and-
whites: the trenches, dead soldiers,
Flanders Field, Ypres, grand
vista of ruin, fallen towers,
crumbling guild halls, skylines
stark with shell-stripped chestnut
trees. Combined with these were
a series of paintings by Vystas
Serelis, slides from the Australian
War Memorial, and shots of war
graves somewhere, I suppose, in
Flanders. The “War Requiem”
itself was from a Decca master
tape of the London Symphony
Orchestra performing with an
unnamed choir. This was played
through Mr. Jolly’s very advanced
stereophonic equipment.
Unfortunately, the method had
radical drawbacks, the most important
of which was that it didn’t help the
music at all. The slides distracted the
listener, but were seldom held long
enough for the viewer. They were, in
fact, a very hotch-potch collection. At
one moment, the sombre British
Museum photos, at another, the trite
little Australian War Memorial
dioramas, and, at another, war graves
in an emotionally overcharged sunset.
One’s final impression was not at all
as sympathetic as it could have been
had, for instance, the presentation con-
tained carefully synchronous dissolves
of the British War Museum photos
alone.
Opera
Earthbound
By JOHN CARGHER
Die Fledermaus. Strauss. Elizabethan
Trust Opera Company, Princess,
Melbourne.
“DIE FLEDERMAUS” is still the
best musical ever written and I have
as yet to see a production which was
not enjoyable in some measure. This
revival of the Trust’s version of a few
years back is first-class entertainment.
By right it belongs to the old Tivoli
circuit. The voices are better, the acting
is better, and the music is better, but
the production, the jokes, and the decor
belong to music hall. This “Fleder-
maus” is good, wholesome family enter-
tainment which can be enjoyed by any-
one, except, perhaps, a native Viennese.
There is a bonus of three guest
artists who, no matter how much out
of place, are a great improvement on
the usual tatty ballet. Donald Smith’s
superb voice is exploited unmercifully
after a heavy season, and I sincerely
trust he will not sing three items eight
times a week for long. His voice is now
a national asset and should not be
Bronhill...sheer delight
wasted. Morag Beaton is hardly ex-
tended singing “My Ain Folk,” and
Alexander Major rounds out the carni-
val atmosphere with the inevitable
“Largo al Factotum.”
Any success the evening has, and it
has more than its share, is due to the
leading artists. Robert Gard and
Maureen Howard make an ideal pair
of infidels. Gard’s Eisenstein, though
yet missing the final polish, is fine. A
good-looking tenor who not only acts
well but has an infectious sense of
humor is a rarity. No Williamson show
has had a better juvenile lead. Maureen
Howard is very nearly his equal and
certainly does not play second fiddle
vocally to June Bronhill, who, surpris-
ingly, plays the lesser role of Adele, the
maid. Miss Bronhill sings as well as
ever and her diction is sheer delight.
It is not her fault that her maid
belongs to a Broken Hill pub rather
than a Viennese household, that the
whole production, in fact, is based on
beer rather than champagne. The
inevitable and interminable vaudeville
act of the prison scene, complete with
jailbirds (get it?) dropping through
the ceiling, may appeal to those who
like their humor broad. I would happily
exchange half or all of it for the ex-
tended passages of Strauss’ best music
which have been excised to make room
for this tomfoolery. A production of
“Die Fledermaus” using the original
libretto in a good translation (what’s
wrong with Dent’s?) would be an even
greater success than the present one.
Theatre
Too few Jews
By PHILLIP ADAMS
Fiddler on the Roof. Her Majesty’s,
Melbourne.
AMERICAN THEATRE without the
Jew would be as unthinkable as Jazz
without the Negro. Without the music
and humor of the Jew the lights would
go out all over Broadway. So it is a
misnomer to think of “Fiddler on
the Roof” as a Jewish musical,
because almost all musicals are
Jewish musicals. There are few
gentiles among the principal com-
posers or librettists—and if the
medium is an American phenom-
enon it is. arguably a Semitic
invention.
“Fiddler” manages to look
back in sentiment to village life
in the Russia of Czarist pogroms
and to pay tribute to a source of
Jewish song and irony. The suc-
cess of “Fiddler” lies in the fact
that it is one of the few musicals
where the emotional richness ex-
ceeds that of the sets and cos-
tumes. The weakness of this pro-
duction is that JCW’s have failed
to make it sufficiently kosher.
How could a production full
of such Yiddisher names as Brigid
Lenihan and Margaret Christen-
sen be expected to capture the elusive
combination of intonation and gesture
that come so naturally to a Zero Mos-
tel? Hayes Gordon, for example, does
as well as a goy could possibly do in
the lead. But every time Max Bruch
is on stage (in a subsidiary role) the
idiomatic inadequacies of Gordon and
the rest of the cast become obvious. The
cast is generally talented and they’ve
been well directed by Fred Hebert, but
beside Bruch they tend to look like so
many insipid shlemiels.
With this considerable observation,
“Fiddler” is a fine piece of work.
Sholom Aleichem’s whimsy hasn’t been
completely lost in the shmaltz, and the
lush dreams of Chagall have added rich-
ness to the settings. “If I Were a Rich
Man” must be one of the most irresis-
tible songs in theatre.
Normally I’m pleased to see indigenes
getting the leads in JCW musicals.
Nancye Hayes, Jill Perryman, and Mark
McManus have turned in good Austra-
lian-made facsimiles of the original
product. But this time I’d have liked
to have seen imported principals. Alter-
nately, Fred Hebert could have found
more Jewish performers locally. I can
think of a number who’d have added
great strength to the proceedings.
FOOTNOTE: It seems that contem-
porary performers aren’t as well-
equipped vocally as their theatrical pre-
decessors—as it has become customary
to boost their voices with microphones
placed among the footlights. This is
an unfortunate development, as (apart
from the disturbing evolutionary impli-
cations) the result is a stereophony of
strident singing and amplified shufflings.


BOOKS
Robert Gordon Menzies
v. the “Practical Men”
By PETER COLEMAN
Afternoon Light. Some Memories of
Men and Events. Sir Robert Menzies.
Cassell. $6.50.
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY the wrong
time to examine the achievements or
failures of Robert Gordon Menzies. The
complacent doctrine that, preoccupied
with England, the Middle-East, and
Africa, he left us unprepared for the
new age of Asia, Defence and the Euro-
pean Common Market is now almost
part of established journalistic ortho-
doxy, and it will be some years before
his greatness as Prime Minister and
founder of the Liberal Party is taken
for granted—and full justice done to
the paradoxes of his career: the Anglo-
phile who led Australia into a per-
manent American alliance, the “free
enterprise” politician who distrusted big
business and promoted the welfare
State, the anti-academic who promoted
universities, the anti-doctrinaire con-
servative who scorned the "practical
men” and insisted that ideology is an
essential basis of his Party . . .
Menzies himself knows that this is
not the time for a balanced assessment
of him. This is clear in this book, not
only in his touchiness about journalistic
and academic commentators or in the
advice he gave Churchill that soon after
his death critics would start “cutting
him down to size” but more un-
expectedly in his defence of Stanley
Baldwin, a defence which Menzies as a
Churchill-ite and Eden-ite can afford
to make: he believes that although Bald-
win’s defence policies were obviously
inadequate, he created the unity with
which Britain went to war in 1939. He
says this knowing that Baldwin’s reputa-
tion “has been tampered with by the
critics,” in other words, destroyed.
Menzies can never be classed with Bald-
win (although their defence policies had
something in common), but in him he
believes he sees the fragility and false-
ness of reputation.
In any case, this book does not set
out to promote his own reputation.
It is too chatty, as its title implies, and
while it ranges over everything from
Suez and the Crown to cricket and
the legal profession, it avoids local
polemics: his relations with Dr. Evatt
or Dr. Page, for example, are barely
mentioned (although he tells us that
Dame Pattie never spoke to Page again
after Page’s attack on him in 1939).
We will have to wait for the publi-
cation of the Virginia lectures on
“Central Power in the Australian
Commonwealth” for his more directly
political ideas and perhaps some years
for more politically critical memoirs.
There is, of course, plenty that is
typical of Menzies in these reminis-
cences from his old-fashioned or
over-literal use of words (he refers to
Roosevelt’s “conversation” of strict
neutrality into benevolent neutrality,
and he disapproves of calling the
Rhodesian situation a rebellion, since
the Latin re-bellum suggests force
should be used against it) to his well-
The 1940 UAP-Country Party Cabinet, with G-G Lord Gowrie (front
row centre)
The Liberal Cabinet in 1954 (right). .. welfare liberalism
known views on royalty and on litera-
ture.
This is his account of the birth of
Prince Charles:
“We had hardly returned to our flat
for some sustaining refreshment when
the announcement of the birth came
over the wireless. At once we set down
our glasses and our knives and forks
and literally galloped across the Green
Park to the Palace. There was the
physician’s bulletin, posted at the gates.
The excitement was intense. We were
all friends, and slapped the backs of
perfect strangers with complete abandon.
For sound reasons we could not call out
for the Princess, but we did, most
lustily and senselessly, call out for the
Duke. By the end of another hour we,
thousands of us, changed our quarry,
and roared for the King. No result.
The balconies of the Palace were un-
tenanted. We then put it on a family
basis. We, and nobody more vocifer-
ously than the ex- and future Prime
Minister of Australia, cried in unison,
‘we want grandfather!’ Wearied by un-
successful well-doing, we then went
home.”
This is his view of modern poetry at
a meeting of the Commonwealth
Literary Fund:
“I shall never forget one meeting at
which some new poet, of the school
which has substituted words for mean-
ing and elusive incoherency for rhythm,
was highly commended. One of his
poems was read out. I turned to Chifley
with an interrogative eyebrow. He
looked across the table to a distin-
guished Australian authoress and said,
‘Miss . . ~ I hope you will forgive me.
But I think it is all bloody nonsense.’
I was grateful to him, for I thought
him dead right.”
But politically the most interesting—
and most sharply written—chapter is
the one on “The Revival of Liberalism
in Australia,” on Menzies’ creation of
the Liberal Party. In 1943, Labor was
in power and the Opposition in frag-
ments, without a national organisation
or national policy and without acknow-
ledged leadership. Menzies was opposed
by the “You-Can’t-Win-With-Menzies”
experts, the “practical men,” as he
ironically calls them, who dismissed his
insistence on the importance of ideology
—on liberalism v. socialism —as


“academic”! (These were the sort of
men who fought the 1940 election on
the slogan “An All-in War Effort is
impossible on Rationed Petrol”!)
Menzies told the Opposition he would
accept leadership on condition “that I
should have a carte blanche” to form a
new party to replace the UAP. Pie got
it. He toured the country for months
(providing his own transport and
spending his own “limited private capi-
tal”) to drum up support for a national
conference in Canberra. He and his
secretary, Miss Eileen Lenihan, did
most of the work. (“It interests me
very much to read that one non-
ranking Junior Senator in the United
States has a personal staff of over sixty”
—but Americans do not believe so pas-
sionately as Australians in the exploita-
tion of politicians.) He also warmly
acknowledges the help he got from Mr.
W. H. Anderson, the man “with no per-
sonal ambitions for Parliamentary
office” who became the “driving force”
in the Liberal Party, and Mrs. “May”
(now Dame Elizabeth) Couchman, who
brought the nation-wide Australian
Women’s National League into the
Liberal Party (“Its members did far
more electoral work than most men”).
By October, 1944, he was ready to con-
vene a meeting in Canberra’s Masonic
Hall of 14 unrelated organisations to
form the new Party.
Menzies was determined to avoid the
UAP’s dependence, especially in New-
South Wales, on big business, to pro-
mote social welfare (the UAP’s role
had been “simply that of the man who
says ‘no’”), and to make the Parlia-
mentary Party, not the organisation,
responsible for election policy (within
the framework of the platform laid
down by the organisation). In all this
he succeeded. But, above all, he per-
suaded the new party that it would beat
Labor on ideological grounds, by ham-
mering at the socialist ideology im-
plicit in Labor’s “practical” policies, by
preaching welfare liberalism against
State socialism—and, sure enough,
Labor handed him a gift in its proposal
to nationalise the banks. The ideological
issue became real, and in December,
1949, the Menzies Government came to
power.
It was a tremendous achievement
over not only Labor but over the scorn
of the “practical” men, the malice of
his enemies, and the organisation mess
of the UAP. He wrote a letter about
this time to a newspaper proprietor who
had denounced him for promoting his
own “supposed interests.” It is a mov-
ing letter and worth quoting:
“Why my supposed interests? Do
you really believe that I have pre-
ferred my own interests?
“If the Prime Ministership is the
crown of political ambition, I have
worn it. After many years of thankless
public work, in which my character
and reputation have been assailed pub-
licly and privately, I might with reason
have returned to a profession in which,
had I remained at it, I should have
been relatively well-off and immune
from malice and abuse. But instead of
returning to a private life, I under-
took the leadership of a defeated
Opposition, the creation of a new
Liberal Party, and the formulation of
a policy which has received high praise
from your own newspaper. With all
respect, I dispute your right to make
slighting references to my ‘supposed
interests’ under the circumstances . . .
When you have had to suffer one tiny
fraction of the criticism and personal
attack to which I have been subjected
for years, you will perhaps be less
ready to resent a gesture of annoyance
and a little more appreciative of public
service which, however human and fre-
quently mistaken, has at any rate been
honest and sustained.”
It is one of the few occasions in the
book when he lets himself say what
he thinks of his critics. He quotes it,
he says, for the benefit of later politic-
ians who will have to put up with
similar malice and abuse, and for the
benefit, “in particular, of my family.”
Blank wall
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
The Russian Novel. F. D. Reeve.
Muller. $4.60.
WHO REALLY DOES know the Rus-
sian novel? The Paper Curtain of
literature seems to have existed long
before the Iron Curtain of politics.
Many of these great masterpieces
have become popularly known for
all the wrong reasons “Eugene
Onegin” more from Tchaikovsky’s
saccharine operatic travesty than for
its ironic thrusts against romanticism;
“War and Peace” and “Dr. Zhivago”
for their wide-screen Hollywoodian
technicolor extravaganzas rather than
for their deep psychological insight into
the problems of existence and per-
sonality.
Probably the general inaccessibility
of the Russian language and some old-
fashioned translations which often yield
nothing but a pale shadow of the
originals are also to blame for a lot
of misunderstanding. Even “The Times
Literary Supplement,” according to Dr.
Reeve, did not fully grasp what “Dr.
Zhivago” is really about.
Now this American Russian scholar,
who has himself wisely translated most
of the excerpts he quotes, has suc-
ceeded in producing a brilliant modern
study embracing more than a century
from Pushkin’s “novel in verse” to
Pasternak’s “novel in prose” what he
aptly calls the two book-end figures
that together flank the period of the
great Russian novel. I must admit that
I have seldom approached what is
ostensibly a fat reference volume with
such misgivings and seldom gone on
to devour every tension-infused sen-
tence with such mounting absorption
and intellectual excitement.
“The Russian Novel” is a must for
anyone seriously interested in literature.
The approach is contemporary-minded,
the going sometimes difficult but
thoroughly rewarding. Unlike ordinary
text-books, it does not deal with the
sort of facts that can be found in any
encyclopedia but goes deeply into the
Pasternak, 1920. .. bookend novel
whole complex question of the novel-
form and -style against the background
of the Russian character, philosophy,
and tradition.
With their extrovert-introversion, the
Russians, as Dr. Reeve shows, try to
take the entire weight of the universe
on their shoulders: their search is for
the meaning of life (or the lack of it).
The devil is often a very personal
sort of chap: as in both Ivan Karama-
zov’s and Raskolnikov’s dreams he may
be a middle-class gent, in the mask
of irreproachable mediocrity. God is
often either good and unreal, or unjust


and real. Death is the blank white wall
through which everyone must pass.
These novelists were more original
than they are usually given credit for.
It may come as a surprise to many to
learn that even before Stendhal, Push-
kin was writing novels of “realism”;
that in the early part of our own
century, the Russians were searching for
new ways with words that in some res-
pects anticipated both James Joyce and
the “nouveau roman”; that they carried
Virginia Woolf’s color experiments still
further; or that Gogol is the most
difficult of all to comprehend.
Dr. Reeve’s technique is to devote a
lengthy chapter to each great novelist
and to dissect in detail one major work
of each. For Dostoevsky he chooses
“Crime and Punishment,” for Tolstoy
“Anna Karenina,” for Chekhov “Three
Years.” Dostoevsky, he argues convinc-
ingly, has not (as he has so often been
accused) set the cynical “mandarin”
problem for Raskolnikov which Balzac
set for his apparent counterpart Ras-
tignac. The similarities between “Crime
and Punishment” and “Pere Goriot”
he proves once and for all to be purely
on the surface. He shows how the
events in Dostoevsky’s space-time
world occur in consciousness that
Raskolnikov is driven into a philosophi-
cal paradox in a wrong-headed search
for freedom and that his tragedy is
that the idea and the act just do not
fit aesthetically.
This book, which goes into the under-
lying impressionism and symbolism of
“Anna Karenina,” also succeeds in
fully exorcising the phantom of Greta
Garbo in black velvet staring at trains.
What really destroys Anna, of course,
is “her failure to apprehend the nature
of the force of life” and the irreconcil-
able contradictions between what the
world had promised her and what it
actually allowed her. As Dr. Reeve
says, “We have learned from the Rus-
sians, more than from anyone else,
that the supreme fictions are what is
true.” Their greatness lies in having-
nut the world into words, and made
them sing.
Fake world
By FRANK KNOPFELMACHER
Ho Chi Minh on Revolution. Selected
Writings, 1920-66. Edited and with an
Introduction by Bernard B. Fall. Pall
Mall Press, London. $7.80.
HO CHI MINH IS one of the very
few surviving top apparatchiks of the
old Comintern. He is a man totally
made, bred, and moulded by Stalin’s
international political engine, and he
was one of its highly standardised and
predictable operatives. Modern
psychology teaches us that people over
75 are unlikely to change habits of a
lifetime (yes, I am being sarcastic—
there are too many psychology pro-
fessors among American Vietniks), and
it is, therefore, most unlikely that the
Hanoi shrimp will start to whistle.
Ho Chi Minh’s political development
is, as it were, conventionally typical for
the sort of politician who has become
the principal curse of this century. An
early social casualty of the French
colonial system young Ho a dis-
gruntled, semi-intellectual-like young
Hitler and Stalin drifted into the
French metropolis to eke out a meagre
living of the kind described in Orwell’s
“Down and Out in Paris and in Lon-
don.” Time was evenly divided between
menial drudgery, such as dish-washing,
reading in public libraries, and indig-
nant revolutionary propaganda against
the admittedly outrageous system of
organised thievery and bullying called
variously France d’outre mer or la
mission civilisatrice by the French
patriotic Press. Inevitably, Flo Chi
Minh and the early burgeoning Comin-
tern apparat met, fell in love at first
sight, and the union has been blissfully
harmonious ever since.
The selected writings of Ho Chi
Minh are almost totally uninformative
as political history, and they contain no
interesting or new material about the
policies of the Indo-Chinese Communist
Party, of which Ho has been undisputed
Ho ... sadistic phantasies
boss since its inception. Yet the book
discloses something about Ho Chi Minh
himself, rather unintentionally, which,
whilst interesting, is not very new. The
book provides a glimpse of what hap-
pens to the language of a man in the
process of being transformed from a
human person into a major piece of
totalitarian hardware. The early articles
are alive. They are screams of furious
indignation uttered by an alienated and
fiercely rebellious revolutionary intellec-
tual from the colored slums of Paris,
where he is trapped. The intellectual
level is uniformly low—a glimpse at
the writings of young Trotsky or Lenin
for comparison will show that but
there is vivid imagery and passion. The
dominant emotion is an undiluted
hatred, perhaps too undiluted to be
entirely credible as merely political and
social hatred.
The excessive wallowing in vivid
and horrible atrocity cases carries a
whiff of sado-masochism, and one
cannot help noticing that many of
these French atrocities, described in
voluptuous detail, resemble very closely
VC terror techniques in South Viet-
namese villages. If they are fabricated,
as they very well may be, they might
have to be treated as instances of
sadistic phantasy, which subsequent
political opportunities have helped to
implement in real life. There is a close
psychological relation between the
invention of atrocity stories and the
actual commission of atrocities, since
the impulse is the same leading
to gratification on phantasy in the
former and to actual torture and
murder in the latter.
Since about 1925 onwards, Ho Chi
Minh’s style has become completely
indistinguishable from Standard Comin-
tern Newspeak, without the slightest
trace of individuality. The articles of
the Left Period (1929-34) and those
of the Popular Front period are pure
djugashvilese and might have been
written by Lance Sharkey, Klement
Gottwald, or Maurice Thorez without
anybody being able to tell the differ-
ence. All the zigs and zags of the
Comintern since 1922 are faithfully
and undeviatingly reflected. The most
meagre coverage is of the years 1936-
39. This is not surprising, in view of
the fact that this classical “Right”
period is politically and emotionally
out of tune with the current “Left”
orientation of the Hanoi regime within
the Communist enterprise.
To say that the book conveys a false
picture of Vietnamese Communist
techniques would be an understate-
ment. The purpose of totalitarian
writing is not only to distort reality
but to create a totally artificial picture
of a world which does not exist at
all. Thus, when Ho Chi Minh exhorts
his soldiers not to annoy the peasants
by playing loud music, he is doing
much more than merely to lie about
confiscations, disembowelling, skinning
alive, and other “administrative
methods” of the VC. He is transporting
his readers into an entirely different
world, into one in which some of
Uncle Ho’s gentle warriors actually
forget themselves from time to time
to the extent of disturbing the peasants
with their boisterous songs.
Bernard Fall’s obsequious introduc-
tion is little more than a PR job for
Ho Chi Minh. It sheds little light on
Ho and some more light on the
intractable fascination which modern
totalitarian dictators continue to exert
on liberal intellectuals, even on good
and brave ones, such as Fall.

Poor relations
By JOHN BAXTER
The Paper Dragon. Evan Hunter. Con-
stable. $4.45.
The Man Who Had Power Over
Women. Gordon M. Williams. Seeker
and Warburg. $3.85.
MODERN BEST-SELLER fiction, as
Anthony Burgess has pointed out,
divides itself neatly into two categories,
the didactic and the pornographic. In
one camp we have the sexual
sports fiction of Robbins and Wallace,
while the other concerns itself with
the intricacies of the Nobel Prize
presentations, Oscar awards, and, as is
now promised us, the Olympic Games.
Evan Hunter, a poor relation in this
society, here makes his try at immor-
tality by combining both traditions with
a garnish of such stand-bys as the
courtroom drama, streanr-of-conscious-
ness character analysis, and war fiction.
The resultant broth, while no doubt
mentally nutritious, is probably too
rich for most people’s taste.
Hunter’s initial idea, to examine the
mechanics of a suit for plagiarism, was
a good one, and the novel begins well,
with scriptwriter Arthur Constantine
producing in court what looks like
overwhelming evidence that one of his
early unsuccessful plays has been used
as the basis of a best-selling novel by
James Driscoll. We meet the opposing
lawyers, one successful, the other
hoping to become so as a result of
this case, the two authors, neither of
whom is especially happy with his
present situation. The playwright is
involved sexually and financially with
the star of his new production, the
novelist cannot come to terms with a
ruined marriage to the woman his love
for whom supported the creation of
his book. There are sundry concubines,
spear carriers, servants, and voices off,
the brisk appearance and disappearance
of whom make it hard to follow both
action and case.
It is unfortunate that Hunter has
not known when to stop developing his
material, because the basic suit is in-
teresting enough to carry the weight
by itself. The evolutions of both argu-
ments, the curious nature of the evi-
dence put forward in a case where a
clear decision must be reached on
such imponderables as emphasis and
style and the painstaking dissection of
Driscoll’s creative process are well
enough presented to make this as inter-
esting as any piece of courtroom sus-
pense fiction.
Our attention, however, is continually
diverted by a fresh excerpt from the
love life of one or another of the
people involved, or by labored excur-
sions into their mental processes. What
interest “The Paper Dragon” has rests
in the suggestion of what it might have
been.
Although no more fragrant than
Hunter’s novel, “The Man Who Had
Power Over Women” is less disappoint-
ing. A cheaply mounted expedition into
the tangled mental jungles of London
public relations man Peter Reaney, it
has its own contribution to make to the
body of literature exposing the tawdri-
ness of modern commercial life and
the impossibility of finding in it am -
thing either of fulfilment or love.
Reaney, half drunk, half mad, lurches
through the demi-monde of London
nightlife, periodically escaping into a
fantasy where, come the revolution, he
and his triumphant group rounds up
all the beautiful women in London
and methodically despoils them, or in
which he is the only potent man in the
world, star tenant of State Brothel
Number One, and lover of the (female)
Prime Minister.
The slightly unhinged ribaldry of
these visions contributes to the book’s
Hogarth-like realism, where the
ludicrous appearance of those roister-
ing does not mitigate their viciousness
or bestiality. Nor is Reaney’s attempt
at escape hard to understand when one
examines his worthless life. Despised
by his associates, bored and disgusted
by the sexual idiosyncrasies of the
women he meets, he finds happiness
only in the motherly virtues of the girl
married to his best friend. When the
friend dies in a car accident, Reaney
moves confidently in, grabbing with
little finesse his first and only chance
at happiness. Expediency stands in for
tenderness, but the action is logical,
Williams suggesting that there being
so little happiness available in this
world, one is a fool not to grab it
when it appears, and to hell with every-
body else.
This disenchanted thesis is presented
with humor, insight, and in a jumbled
sort of language that hints at style.
Scatology abounds and, though sexual
detail is extravagantly presented, its
ambience is unerotic. Reaney’s women
are either harridans or whores; the
beautiful are perverted, the normal un-
willing, the available have bad breath.
The breast-feeding, home-cooking Jody
occasionally seems too much the
madonna, but her character is an ap-
propriate foil to the nastiness of every-
body with whom Reaney is involved.
One would not call this book pleasant,
but its realism and malicious wit make
it more than worth reading.
Intolerable Eden
By MARGARET IRVIN
East of Living, J. M. Couper. Edwards
& Shaw. $2.50.
THIS BOOK OF poems could be sub-
titled “The Voice of Exile,” for it
expresses the nostalgia of a man sep-
arated from the country and hemisphere
of his birth and upbringing. However,
he does not descend to sentimental
lamentation, accepting an alien en-
vironment with irony, amusement, or
anger. Though it is plain to see where
his heart lies, such a poem as “A
Sydney Scot when the boat comes in”
is .a revelation of his rejection of the
worst of the old for the best of the
new, with certain reservations. It con-
cludes with a moving recall of the
poet’s homeland.
J. M. Couper’s poetry is canny,
witty, cryptic, and often knottily
stubborn. It also has depths wherein
opposites are ranged satire and
tenderness, cacophony and harmony,
puritanism and sensuality, and stoicism
and compassion.
The book is composed mainly of
long poems in which narration mingles
with rumination. “Cape Catastrophe,”
narrated by Robert Brown, one of
Matthew Flinder’s officers on the ship
Investigator, is the most moving and
compassionate poem. Brown tells the
story of the character, background,
love and death of the seaman Thistle,
who, with others, was drowned in a
rip-tide. The poem is remarkable for
its grasp of distance and space and for
its graphic details of sea, coastline,
and climate.
The poet conveys the “agony of
emptiness” of ocean and continent.
“The reptile summer hot behind the
beach” gives way to “only suffocating
paleolithic peace, this serene intoler-
able Eden.” Men, their loneliness and
deaths, are tragically anonymous against
the immensity of the south land and
sea.
In Sydney, a mid-twentieth-century
Scot writes “A series of letters to
Mark Alexander Boyd,” who lived in
Ayrshire from 1563 to 1601. The poem
stresses both the differences and simi-
larities which draw the two men to-
gether. The nightingales and larks
“Fled south, man, south
Not as south as this.
Here larks are abolished. There’s
hardly a crow
To deave itself dumb on Sydney’s
noise.”
The poem is astringent, satirical, and
sometimes discordant and crude, the


here’s

This refreshingly light and
delicate white wine is produced
from grapes of the Rhine Riesl-
ing, Hunter River Riesling and

statement of a man in rebellion against
a time and place with which he is out
of sympathy. The poem ends with a
seascape as if, for the poet, the sea is
his link with a past synonymous with
decent tradition and a proud domestic
history.
The prosody of “Catterline,” the
third long poem, is the most difficult
and compressed. The theme is requited
and unrequited love, with distant Cat-
terline, “who seemed to live in the
wake of his life,” looming large as the
poem concludes.
The final section is a miscellany of
shorter poems satirical portraits and
commentaries, verses after Juvenal and
Rilke, and others of Biblical and local
reference. The most impressive is the
title poem, “East Of Living,” sinewy,
pensive, and strongly orientated.
The omnipresence of the sea
throughout the book is one of its
strengths; another lies in its pithy
observations of men and their irrecon-
cilable characteristics, one of the most
succinct being:
Poets are best as a posthumous kind
of breed.

they’re not very real.

. When, living, they’re only serious
about themsell?
Books in brief
Japanaiserie
Death in Midsummer, and Other
Stories. Yukio Mishima. Seeker and
Warburg. $3.15.
THE WORK OF MISHIMA, most
celebrated of the younger Japanese
novelists, is characteristically national
in its cold cataloguing of the physical
details of birth, illness, sex, and death,
and in its withdrawal from all moral
judgments. In these stories, we are
made to feel it doesn’t matter what
happens between the pre-natal state
and the oblivion that follows death.
In translation, Mishima often
sounds grotesque, as in his description of
Hara-Kiri, that sine qua non of so
many Japanese love stories (the Jap-
anese like romance to be tragic):
“Seemingly ignorant of their master’s
suffering, the entrails gave an impres-
sion of robust health and almost dis-
agreeable vitality as they slipped
smoothly out.”
The passage is from “Patriotism,”
a story about an officer and his
wife who spend a last night of love
together before he suicides. The author
appeared in a film version of this tale,
under his own direction. Other stories,
dealing with paternity, monasticism,
and suspicion, are written in the same
earthy, brutally factual and icily
smooth style, never really likable but
often adroit and pleasantly unsenti-
mental.
Seedy cloisters
Lord Dismiss Us. Michael Campbell.
Heinemann. $3.85.
CAMPBELL’S MUCH - PRAISED
novel is set in an English public school:
claustrophobic, almost stifling in its
re-creation of an enclosed community,
it evokes in “Weatherhill” (Charter-
house? Winchester?) a typically dis-
agreeable example 'of this kind of
establishment. The blurb is off-putting:
“As if in some vast circular aquarium
the inhabitants of the school move
around within their boundaries, some
waiting carp-like at the bottom and
others darting and flashing through the
shoals, revealing light and beauty and
sometimes danger.” Luckily, in his
chronicle of sport, chapel, dorm, and
study, of bullying and homosexuality,
and moments of glory on the playing
field, Campbell is less fulsome; although
his style is barely serviceable and his
vocabulary limited, he does succeed in
throwing a bright light into the seedy
cloisters of his world.
Higher lunacy
Movie Man. David Thomson. Seeker
and Warburg. $5.30.
WE ARE LONG past the time when
“serious” critics ignored or sneered at
the cinema: major figures like Trilling,
Edmund Wilson, and Cyril Connolly
may continue to pretend that it doesn’t
exist, but Dwight MacDonald, Susan
Sontag, Pauline Kael, and other high-
powered careerist dilettantes have been
chopping it up for study for some years
past. As examples of the Higher Lunacy
we have recently had Eric Rhodes’ and
Raymond Durgnat’s inane books on
film, and now we can add David Thom-
son’s “Movie Man” to a rapidly growing
and increasingly tiresome list.
Humorless and plodding, Thomson
provides an exasperating thesis on the
cinema to show “how a personal
response combines appreciation of both
the reality and the concept,” whatever
that means. Sample burst (on “Une
Femme Mariee”): “The face of Macha
Meril is a sign of human existence and
human mortality; its elements are its
own means of observation eyes, ears,
nose, mouth. Almost as if we were look-
ing at the face of an insect, we reject
attributions of our own meaning and
ideas that we might apply to it.”
Reading similarly fatuous animad-
versions on the OK directors of the
moment, Hawks, Hitchcock, Godard,
Lang, Demy, we are reminded of
Hitch’s own comment on the French
philosophical interpretations of his
work: “Oh, well, it’s very nice . . .”


CONNOISSEUR
TABLE WINES
NOTES FROM LINDEMAN’S
CELLAR MANAGER:
One of the most crucial steps in the
making of fine quality matured-in-the-
bottle table wines, is their bottling. In
the case of Clarets and Burgundies we
bottle at approximately 18 months age,
and in a few minutes during bottling it
is possible to irreparably damage the
wine so carefully handled and matured
during that period. With low priced
table wines there is plenty of wine to
replace the loss, but when we are
handling wines such as our 1966 “Ben
Ean" Burgundy from the Hunter River
Valley, the very irreplacability of the
wine is more serious than any financial
loss.
During the past few weeks our Sydney
winemaker, Gerry Sissingh, has been al-
most broodiqg over our finest and
choicest 1966 dry reds three superb
Hunter River Valley Burgundies, a Clare
Valley Shiraz-Cabernet, a Coonawarra
Cabernet Sauvignon, a Langhorne’s
Creek Oeillade-Shiraz and a special
Lindeman blended red from our vine-
yards in the Hunter River Valley,
Coonawarra and Clare.
The bulk wines are received in casks
from the country wineries, where they
have been maturing in wood, and are
then carefully and painstakingly handled
to ensure they are just right to go into
bottle. Bottling itself is carried out in an
automatic bottling machine to eliminate
the chances of human error, and the
bottles are then immediately sealed with
selected high grade corks.
Air is the arch-enemy of the quality
conscious winemaker oxidising and
destroying the fine vinous flavours and
at no other time is the wine more liable
to aeration than at bottling.

Wine's scarce,
but not
books about it
HOW THE DEVIL do you review
books about wine? Do you show off
your own erudition by pointing out the
large and small mistakes? If so, be
prepared for a Cellarmasterly bout of
exhibitionism.
I have just read “The Wines of Aus-
tralia,” by Harry Cox (publisher Hod-
der and Stoughton, $4.65). The mis-
takes are too numerous to ignore. Pen-
fold’s make their Hunter wines at the
Dalwood Estate at Wybong and not at
the Dalwood, Branxton, winery, which
is now devoid of wood and equipment.
Lindeman’s Ben Ean Moselle does not
come from the Hunter and no one has
suggested it does for years. That com-
pany’s Coolalta White Burgundy and
Red Hermitage are blends of various
regional wines and this is stated on the
label. The Kirkton Chablis isn’t a Hun-
ter, either. The Hardy’s St. Thomas
Burgundy is no longer full-bodied, and
the Cabinet in Cabinet claret is derived
from the German use of the name,
meaning something special to be kept
in the wine-makers’ sideboard and has
nothing to do with Cabernet. I haven’t
seen any wooden vats used for making
wine in the new Mount Pleasant winery
and neither has the McWilliam I
checked with. I agree that the Hunter
Valley does produce less than an eighth
of Australia’s wines. In fact, it produces
less than a hundredth. And then I read,
“Minchinbury is cultivated and planted
now with more than 250 acres of vines.”
I bet Penfold’s wish it was! After four
seasons of rain in ’5O, ’52, ’53, and ’55
the vines packed up the struggle. Leaf-
roll disease was diagnosed and the vines
were pulled out in ’5B. Today, there is
little over 30 acres at Southridge and
Minchinbury. Mr. Cox must have been
reading the wrong handbooks. (I
checked the 1962 revised edition of
“Wine in Australia” by Walter James.
It states, “Minchinbury . . . made at
the 240-acre vineyard of that name
. . .”) I could go on and I won’t.
Do you review by comparison? If so,
the book does not come out of it very
well. The history is not as comprehen-
sive as in Simon’s book of last year
(though there is a claim in the
patronising, outdated Postgated fore-
word that Mr. Cox tells us the detailed
history for the first time). The wine
details are nowhere near as specific as
in Max Lake’s book. The general know-
ledge about wine and area is not nearly
as precise as in Murphy’s very useful
paperback. Even my “Cellarmaster’s
Guide to Australian Wines” is far
more with-it.
Then what about literary merit? I
am not qualified to judge on that score.
But I certainly found it the most read-
able of all the wine books lately pub-
lished. Harry Cox is a talented, trained
writer. He moves through the pages of
wine history with ease and anecdote,
and there is plenty of the appropriate
flow.
Wine anecdotes are notoriously diffi-
cult. What was hilarious at eleven at
night after discussing the three whites,
four reds, and the vintage port, does
not seem as funny the following day.
Yet I can imagine the laughter caused
around the table by Mr. Cox’s various
yarns. He has the ability to transmit all
the fun there is in wine in a few pithy
sentences.
And though I’ve stated that Andre
Simon’s overall facts are more precise,
I enjoyed reading the historical parts
of Cox’s book. There is much to learn
from them, some names I’ve never heard
of —and I’ve got all sorts of books—
and there are very few dry-as-tannin-
dust pages. For the wine-buff there are
important chapters and stories about
the men that Mr. Cox knew: Maurice
O’Shea, Tom Seabrook, Samuel Wynn,
the Seppelts, and others. Of them he
writes with affection and good taste with
no hint of the hero worship that affects
some of us.
If only he had got his facts right. I
imagine that this book has been in the
process of being written for some time.
There has been a lot happening lately
in the wine world. If “The Wines of
Australia” had appeared two years ago
it would have been snapped up. Now,
with a half-dozen others around, much
is repetition. And Harry Cox is not
really that dedicated. He is more a
gentle and quietly witty scholar than
the assertive and opinionated palate.
He likes his glass of wine and conveys
this liking in a pleasant book that will
help many people to a better under- v
standing of wine, and why people are
interested in wine. But the definitive
Wines of Australia has still to be writ-
ten.
I find it easier to review Max Lake’s
new book, “Vine and Scalpel,” pub-
lished by Jacaranda. There are two
prices, $8.40 for the standard line and
$12.60 for the numbered Private Bin.
First, it is more about men than
wine, and is, therefore, unlikely to pro-
voke endless wine argument. Secondly,
at either price it is far too expensive.

pleased. But not $8.40 worth and cer-
tainly not $12.60, even if I got Number
One. I like good-looking wine labels,
but it’s the stuff in the bottle that
counts.
After all, there are only 72 pages,
and of these six are devoted to the
woodcut portraits of various solemn
doctors, and four more to the index.
I can’t imagine what got into them.
However, I suppose they know what
they are doing. They do their job well,
and the paper is certainly very nice.
I’m more concerned about Max and
his wine-writing reputation. I do hope
his readers will not think he is cashing
in on the success of his other two books,
“Hunter Wine” and “Classic Wines of
Australia.” If offended, they may not
purchase the other books that I know
he has in him. It would be their loss.
Max is probably more devoted to the
study and glory of wine than any other
man in Australia. And it is still his
hobby. He has the energy and ability to
convey his enthusiasm to others. His
“Classic Wines,” though written un-
tidily, as if he couldn’t get his
thoughts and revelations on paper fast
enough, is a must for any serious
student of wine. It contains ten to 15
years’ work of mind and palate, and is
full of his application and original
thinking. People having read it will be
anxious to learn more from the learned
doctor. They will be disappointed by
“Vine and Scalpel.” I know that Max
feels the same way. He started out to
write a pamphlet, only the cutting
turned out to be a beanstalk.
Not that there isn’t merit there. Far
from it. It is easily his best written
book. It flows well and easily, is full
of interesting information about doctors
addicted to the produce of the vine
and the romance of it, and pays par-
ticular attention to those who had the
energy and foresight to do something
about it. There is one story from Julian
Russell abqut Gilbert Phillips that will
live for years; indeed, I found the
couple of thousand words about
Phillips the high point of the book.
There is a useful and general summary
about Max’s own feelings and attitudes,
and, of course, there is good talk about
wine and food. As Max says, “On quan-
tity alone, I do have some little right
to talk about food.”
But there are still only 72 pages. It’s
an interesting book, and I do hope that
it’s not the last that he will write. But
we shall all want more substance next
time.
I suppose it’s to do with affluence: we
are in the middle of a wine boom and
prices have risen accordingly. Now I
suppose we are in for the wine book
boom. I am just sorry that the first
evidence of it has come from a man I
know never intended to make money
from writing about wine but just
wanted others to share his pleasure.

LETTERS
Teachers' esteem
Eric Atkins in his letter (8., Oct. 14)
commenting on Brian Buckley’s article
on teachers (8., Sept. 30) asserts that
the teachers in primary and infants’
schools are no more than supervisors,
and from this he draws the conclusion
that they are grossly overpaid. It is not
the fact that one is a supervisor which
deserves comment, but rather the rele-
vant fact is what is being super-
vised?
He assumes that the high-school
pupil deserves extremely highly quali-
fied teachers (if we accept the Masters
Degrees held by New York teacffers
as high qualifications), yet implies that
up to this point the child has been able
to prepare himself for the high standard
of secondary education on his own
initiative —not even with teacher guid-
ance, but merely with teacher super-
vision. Somehow or another not
through the efforts of suitably qualified
elementary schoolteachers—the basic
concepts of language, mathematics,
science, and indeed of learning are
available in the First Form student as a
foundation for the knowledge to come.
Perhaps Mr. Atkins has forgotten, if
he was ever aware, that a child enters
the infants’ school with only four years
of narrow experience behind it. It is the
infant’s teacher and, after her, the prim-
ary teacher who build on this limited
basis and inculcate into the child not
only the ability to understand and carry
out the basic skills in a wide range of
subjects but also instil into the pupil
the attitudes and habits necessary for
successful social living.
Mr. Atkins’ arguments, if serious, fail
in three ways. Firstly, he fails to show
that whatever a pupil is to achieve in
the secondary school, it depends upon
successful preparation by primary-
school teachers, no matter how highly
trained the secondary teachers are.
Secondly, he fails to show that the
work “supervised” by primary teachers
is not important enough to deserve the
salaries paid to these teachers. Thirdly,
he fails to show that the teachers con-
cerned do not need the training given
to them (and regarded as a minimum
necessity) in order to achieve satisfac-
tory standards with their pupils.
Adrian Mclnnes
Niangala, N.S.W.
Teachers in primary and infants’
schools are not merely supervisors or
child-minders. Anyone with the slightest
knowledge of child development would
know that the early years at school are
far more important in many respects
than the secondary years and that here
teaching skill needs to be at its highest.
In those years the teacher is handling
the most delicate and complex, growing
and dynamic organism, not simply a
dead piece of machinery as Mr. Atkins
would like to think by comparing the
work with receptionists or Customs
officials.
In fact, if anything, it is the
secondary-school teacher who can afford
to look at himself as a supervisor. By
that stage, if the primary teacher has
done his work well, the child could get
along by himself with a minimum of
outside help. To demand a Master’s
degree at this stage in Australia would
be asking for trouble—not only because
our systems are flat-out attracting
enough holders of Bachelor’s degrees
but also because extra academic- know-
ledge does not make one a better
teacher, in most cases, and only
encourages the style of teaching seen
at university, which could be classed as
supervising.
No, the answer is not to lower stan-
dards in the primary teaching service
still further. Perhaps this is the very
problem we are facing: that we have
not raised the standards far enough.
When practically anyone can become a
teacher, the profession means nothing,
there is no challenge to attract talented
people, and it loses any value it has as
a job requiring skill, application, and
devotion. Many people see nothing hard
in teaching, because it has not been
raised to a high enough level of return
and prestige as a work of skill.
People holding this view are still in
the Victorian era, but we can be thank-
ful that at last there are signs that
maybe our education system as a whole
might be ready to move out of this era.
Howard - Thomas

It is Mr. Atkins’ viewpoint, shared by
many like him, that makes a teacher’s
job as heartbreaking as it often is: the
general apathy toward education and
antipathy toward teachers found in
many homes carried through to school
by the child; the lack of curiosity
about the miracles of nature; the con-
tinual echoing of “what good will
knowing this do me?”; the desperate
straining to be free of the prison of
education into the paradise of a cleri-
cal or laboring “profession.”
Perhaps he is right. Perhaps teachers
are not professional people. Perhaps
education is a complete waist of time,
because communication and knowledge-
are not so important in the world.
Teachers are to be classed with recep-
tionists and clerks, since the work they
do is so trivial. After all, it is only the-
teachers who first inspire a child and


arouse in him a desire to become a
doctor, lawyer, or otherwise “profes-
sional” person.
Irene Zukiwsky
Boorowa, N.S.W.
It may be true that it is a mistake to
assume that teachers are professionals
in the same sense that doctors and
lawyers are, because the teacher’s duty
differs. But I feel teachers should, at
the very least, be accorded equivalent
status with the professionals and paid
an appropriate salary.
Our schools lack a great number of
good teachers because it is these men
and women who are leaving the service
to take positions in industry and better
paid teaching posts overseas. These
people have been driven away by the
apathy of our Education Departments
toward their needs as teachers of our
young adults. The Government is the
representative of the people, and thus
it is the people’s responsibility to rectify
the situation they might blame the
Government for.

Unmarried mothers
I was most interested to read Rose-
mary Kiely’s article on Unmarried
Mothers (8., Oct. 14), where she airs
some of the complex issues and prob-
lems of this group and also the attitudes
of the community toward the un-
married mother. There is a perhaps
unavoidable tendency to oversimplify
many important questions. For example,
to take one controversial point—do we
as members of the public consider that
it is always in the best interests of the
putative father, the unmarried mother,
or the child, for the father to be forced
to continue to pay maintenance for the
child when he is not involved in making
decisions for the child’s future and
where he has no legal rights?
As a social worker I would contend
that such continuing responsibility could
be constructive for those directly in-
volved, but equally it could be damag-
ing to the future of these young people.
It so depends upon the circumstances
and the individual’s needs. And this is
a vital aspect of the social worker’s task
in working with people in difficulties,
that is, to understand and, in this
instance, to help the unmarried mother
to understand the factors, emotional,
social, and environmental, which have
brought her to this crisis. Only by this
approach is the girl able to reach a
carefully thought out decision about her
own and her child’s future.
No more than the social worker can
the Australian Association of Social
Workers be dogmatic about one effec-
tive solution to this problem. But the
Association does have a policy. Through
its Code of Ethics members are ex-
pected to maintain a high standard of
service to the client, incorporating the
foregoing principles indicated in con-
nection with the unmarried mother and
also to the community.
Social workers working in family
agencies, in hospitals, and in Govern-
ment departments have studied various
aspects of this problem and sought to
improve facilities. Submissions have
been made to relevant authorities and
papers on this subject have been pre-
sented at national conferences of the
Association.

Benefits in Vietnam
Your correspondent Mr. Douglas (8.,
Oct. 21) is needlessly angry about “prac-
tice” in Vietnam. In the benefits we are*
bringing to Vietnam it is fair to say
that we are giving help and guidance;
help in military protection, money, and
actual labor in civil aid, and guidance
from military advisers, agricultural
experts, and so on. However, this alone
could not justify the exercise. For this,
there must also be some clear benefits
to Australia.
Our Army is improving its ability to
assemble military equipment and fight-
ing men, transport and deploy them,
and perform military tasks. This is of
great value to the country. As a conse-
quence, Australia’s influence is notice-
ably greater than it was.
Next, the young men actually taking
part benefit. They are better citizens,
more capable, more confident.
It is still true, of course, that our
leaders should continue to resist Ameri-
can efforts to dictate our scale of
involvement and methods of fighting.

The Fill
Is it surprising that “the RAAF might
be misunderstood” (8., Oct. 21), when
Peter Isaacson says that the Fill . . .
fully meets all RAAF specifications:
supersonic speed at all altitudes; suffi-
cient range for world-wide deployment;
capable of . . . delivering a heavy
weapon pay load . . .
Perhaps the Fill meets the specifi-
cations singly, but is its range at super-
sonic speeds sufficient for world-wide
deployment? Can it carry a heavy
weapon and/or bomb load to the target
at supersonic speeds? Was it designed
essentially for nuclear bombs when used
in the bomber role?
Ofher points in the article are open
to criticism: what is the “very short
notice” to deploy mobile radar units?
Is it conceivable that in any theatre in
which the RAAF will have to fight that
air superiority will depend on the
RAAF? Why can’t the Army acquire
the skills needed for the close support
role? The U.S. Marines do. Where are
the 4000 troops that the RAAF moved
to Vietnam? Qantas and HMAS Sydney
seemed to take most of those at pre-
sent there. What conceivable connection
is there between the performance of the
short-ranged Mirage in the Israeli-
Arab conflict and Australia’s defence
problems?
J. Camvan
Brookvale, N.S.W.
The term “air superiority” was coined
by the RAF to match the naval objec-
tive of “controlling sea communica-
tions.” Both the Army and the Navy
fully accepted its tactical application
with the rider that for opposed land-
ings aircraft-carriers were necessary. Its
strategical application has been ques-
tioned before, during, and since World
War II by many competent authorities.
In the context of Mr. Isaacson’s
article, Mr. Baker’s nonsensical use of
the word “admiralty” and coining of
a new word “aerialty” merely confuse
the issue. Mr. Isaacson stated “the
Army can only be successful if air
superiority has first been achieved—
this is the Air Force’s responsibility.”
Can the RAAF guarantee air superiority
throughout the voyage and landing of
an amphibious force? Surely this can
be achieved only by a navy equipped
with attack aircraft-carriers.

Hornsby, N.S.W.
Art
Your correspondent Mr. Richard
Meyer (8., Oct. 28) writes in criticism
of Professor Bernard Smith’s appraisal
of the recent study of Sidney Nolan by
Elwyn Lynn.
In his criticism of the status and mis-
conceptions of the art historian, Mr.
Meyer will not concede that Professor
Smith makes an intelligent response to
Lynn’s book. Smith initiates a dialogue
of assessment and criticism which
raises the intellectual integrity and
interest of discussions on art.
It is beside the point whether one
agrees or disagrees with all statements
made as long as they are intelligent
and inquisitive. The evaluation of art
is surely always a demanding task for
those who undertake it. What is wrong
with analytical writing if one alternative
is impressionistic? It is only when the
alternatives come together that we
reach fruitful discussion.
Art is not only a vehicle for emotion;
no single approach can exhaust it. If
we do not support the discussion of art
throughout the community without
emotional and intellectual prejudice
against the art historian or the critic,
we are destroying any climate of
maturity for the reception of the ajts
in Australia.
