THE PALE WORKER.
(From the Yiddish of Morris Rosenfeld.)
Lo I yonder I see the pale worker,
Stitch, stitch, without pause, without stay,
Since first I remember him, stitching,
And paler and weaker each day.
The slow months roll on in their courses.
The years are as days that have been,
And still the pale worker, bent double,
Fights hard with the cruel machirif.
But from dawn till the sunset and darkness,
The tear-drops fall heavy and slow.
Till the seams of the cloth he is stitching
Are wet with the vintage of woe.
I pray you, how long must he drive it,
This wheel that is red for a sign l
Can you reckon the years of his bondage,
And the end—that grim secret—divine J
Too hard (i/re such questions to answer,
But this I am bold to declare .-y
When Death shall ha ve slain the pale worker,
Another will sit in his chair.
B. PAUL NEUMAN (in The Spectator).
ISRIEL ZANGWILL, ZIONIST
ISRAEL ZANGWILL has capitulated
to his race. No man can escape his
nationality for long ; his individuality
is pitted against the overwhelming
mass of his ancestry, and the tragedy
of genius is the struggle of one man
against the many in him. Zangwill suffers
from the fact that his race is of all races the
most aggressive, the most isolated. He was
born a Jew ; for a little while he was him-
self, an artist in words; but now his people
have claimed him, and he becomes a Jew
again. He has written great novels of the
universal, like The Master ; he has frolicked
among the absurdities of The Batchelors’ Club;
he has written eight plays of the type of
Merely Mary Ann ; he has exploited the
humor of the Hebrew in The King of
Schnorrers, and his pathos in Dreamers of
the Ghetto and Children of the Ghetto . Then,
suddenly, he felt the crushing weight of his
heritage; he doffed his art to put on his
ancestry : the author became the Zionist,
the artist the pamphleteer. He saw his
race exchange the ghetto for the world, and in
the conquest of that world lose its own soul.
The Jew, so strangely preserved without a
home for two thousand years, is beginning to
betray his tradition; he is winning the
world by merging with it. Once he had no
home ; now in finding a home he is in danger
of losing his homogeneity.
Israel Zangwill saw all this, and it sad-
dened, yet spurred him. He saw no way of
stemming the Anglisation or the Americisa-
tion of the Jew save in Zionism. Writing
books was mere futility when his race was
jlying. He became a Zionist. So now he
writes his Ghetto Comedies (Heinemann),
wherein, a little wearily, he traces the
weaknesses and the strengths of his race,
without much hope, it seems to us, of the
ultimate triumph of his dream of a separate
nationality. Probably it was not the will of
Providence, but the walls of the ghetto, that
have preserved and sharpened the race so
long. And the walls of the ghetto are
down. The Zionists propose rebuilding
them in Palestine. But whence are the
occupants to come ? Zangwill does not dis-
guise his disillusionment; yet he is still a
Jew. So these Comedies are touched with
pathos and a little pain ; the humor in them
is bitter ; he cannot jest without a sigh.
For surely here at last was the true tragedy of
the people of Christ—to have persisted sublimely,
and to be as sordidly perverted; to be king and
knave in one ; to survive for two thousand years
the loss of a fatherland and the pressure of" per-
secution, only to wear on its soul the yellow
badge which had defaced its garments. For to
suffer two thousand years for an idea is a privi-
lege that has been accorded only to Israel—‘the
soldier of God.’ That were no tragedy, but an
heroic epic, even as the prophet Isaiah had pre-
figured. The true tragedy, the saddest sorrow,
lay in the martyrdom of an Israel unworthy of his
sufferings.
Yefc interesting most of these studies are ;
in them are delightful bubbles of the old
wit, outbreaks of rollicking fun, and the
clever character-drawing of The Master.
Zangwill draws for us the bluff English
Sir Asher Aaronberg, the collector of pic-
tures, who nevertheless barred Italian art.
“In Italian art one is never safe from the
Madonna, not to mention her Son.” . . . He
cherished a contempt, softened by stupefication,
for the arithmetical incapacity of Trinitarians.
Christianity under any other aspect did not exist
for him. It was a blunder impossible to a race
with a genius for calculation. “ How can three
be one?” he would demand witheringly of his
cronies.
It is, however, in “The Hirelings” that
Zangwill’s saddened irony breaks most
pathetically out. He sees his race but the
servants of the heathen world it equally
despises and uses.
Jewish geniuses! Don’t talk to me of our
geniusesj it is they that have betrayed us. Every
other people has its great men ; but our great
men—they belong to every other people. The
world absorbs our sap, and damns us for our
putrid remains. Our best must pipe alien tunes
and dance to the measures of the heathen. They
build and paint; they write and legislate. But
never a song of Israel do they fashion, nor a
picture of Israel, nor a law of Israel, nor a temple
of Israel. Bah ! What are they but hirelings ?
Some day when Zangwill is convinced of
the futility of his dream, he may slough his
race and return to himself. He is a hireling
.worthy of his hire.
THE TREND THAT DIDN'T.
Chapter III. —From the Frying-Pan into
the Chimney.
“ Doomed ! ” exclaimed Alice.
“No, Darling, saved !’’whispered the pseudo
telegraph-line mender, rushing to her side.
“ Charles ! ” exclaimed the beautiful girl.
“I overheard the plot,’’ whispered her lover.
“ In this disguise I cut the wire before they could
telephone for the bloodhounds.”
He was interrupted by thunderous knocking at
the door,
“ Here’s my plan. From that telegraph post
the wires sag close to a cottage roof. I’ll grasp
the post and cling by my feet to the window sill.
You will walk over my body, get on the wires,
and slide to safety. It is the only way,”
His sternness stifled opposition.
She crossed his straining body.
“ Courage !” she heard him gasp.
Then her eyes opened in horror.
The three pursuers had dashed in, and had
foolishly rushed together upon the human bridge.
The doomed wretches, and the intrepid Charles,
crashed screamingly down into the abyss.
“John Blackadder, this is your work! Be-
ware!” exclaimed Alice, when she recovered.
Confidently she began her perilous slide.
Suddenly someone below shouted a warning.
Too late!
The wires snapped, and the brave girl fell feet
first into the dark maw of a huge smoke stack.
It proved her salvation.
(More, please !)
[Alice is now falling down a chimney. Her
situation, it seems to us, calls for pathos. Authors
will kindly turn on the tap of tears. Weeps
(marked “Serial”) must be received by this office
by Tuesday next.]

Among the most interesting of the contents of
Steele Rudd’s Magazine for August is Edward
Dyson’s review of the reviews of his Fact'ry
'Ands. He finds that Sydney papers are, by far,
the most generous of Australasian critics, and
Melbourne reviewers much the least willing to
give play to the kindlier impulses.
T. D. Mutch comes up smiling, and, incidentally,
has a dirty left:—“John P.” commences a long
boost-up of himself in the Red Page (8/8/’07) by
perpetrating a D pun; in fact, a T.D pun.
That pun on my name is just on twenty-two years
of age. It was made the day I was born, and I
believe my father was the culprit. If “John
P.’s ” stuff is as out of date as the pun, or if I may
deduce its quality from the fact that The Bulletin
man has “scratched the sign of the cross on
the back of nearly all the verse ‘ John P.’ has sent
him,” I am not at all surprised that he has to send
it to America to get rid of it. By deduction,
also, I deduce that those weird, woeful, and won-
derful tales of alleged Australian life we some-
times glance through ip English and American
periodicals are not written by ignorant English
and American writers, but by “unknown” pen-
men (or women) of the “ John P.” Stinking Fish
type, here in these States, or over the way in the
Dominion. “John P.” loses sight of the fact
that those remarks were intended for the literary
aspirant, not for the man who has “bumped
against every big editor worth his salt in
the States.” (Note the American skite.) But
the cap seems to have fitted him very well.
If a literary aspirant has anything in him, getting
an axe and doing something with it Won’t
stop him worth a wallaby’s whiskers. And
when “John P.” says that he has never lost a
manuscript, and never had an important M.S.
marked in any way, well he is stating a happy
experience that is not enjoyed by any Australian
writer I have spoken to on the subject. And how
many Australians are living—mind, living— on
literary (as apart from journalistic) work? Why,
the very best of them clear out as soon as they
possibly can (e.g., only the latest instance, Albert
Dorrington). It’s just about time that an Author’s
Union was formed in Australia, for the purpose
of : (1) Securing a prompt decision from editors
regarding MSS. (2) Payment on acceptance.
(3) Payment at reasonable rates. However, I am
glad to have afforded “John P.” an opportunity
of having a few lines printed in an Australian
paper.
London publishers issue a new sixpenny edition
every day of the year.
William De Morgan, whose Alice-for-Short and
Joseph Vance are, if extremely long, quite read-
able, has “arrived” as a writer of fiction at the
age of 67. Reviewers have hailed him as “a
coming novelist.” There is a moral lurking
somewhere about for the young Australian author.
Nowit is, by Oxford’s interference, Dr. Mark
Twain. Also Dr. Rudyard Kipling.
The sort of book to throw info your bag as you
start for a holiday in the country is Rambles of an
Australian Naturalist , written by Paul Fountain
from the notes and journals of Thomas Ward
(J. Murray). Ward is a Queensland stock-farmer,
and Fountain is a writer, and regards this book as
his foster-child. There are statements in the
book with which we cannot acquiesce; but
generally it is well written. Specially interesting
is his summary of the native blackfellow, and his
description of the submarine life of the Great
Barrier Reef.
WHAT THE AUSTRALIAN WORKER
READS
The three months which I spent, incognito,
among Australian workers, sharing their life and
their labors, their joys and their sorrows, belong
to the most precious of my life. In the Queens-
land shearing shed, on the goldfield, m the
factory in Victoria, in the New South Wales
colliery—everywhere I met splendid, sturdy men,
who were a realisation of Goethe s words :
Let Man be noble,
Helpful and kind.
Each time I set out for one of these laboring
centres my Australian friends warned me against
my mad idea, and talked of the “ rough crowd,”
and the bad time it would give me. Yet never
in all the time I spent as a worker did I meet
with a rough or insulting word : the good fellows
helped the “new chum” wherever they could,
had consideration for his lack of skill, and showed
themselves sympathetic brothers to the new mem-
ber of their guild. He who has learned to know
these men will have no doubts of Australia s proud
future.
Yet many have Sought to overcast this hope
with doubt, because these “masters of the tool”
stood apart from the culture of their country ; have
shed easy reproof on their lack of interest in the
tine arts, their waste of time and money on mate-
rialistic amusements—yet without asking what
was the cause, the reason for it. As a matter of
fact, and in no smaller measure than other
classes, the workers do strive after the ideal good
things of life, when those good things are brought
in their way, and when their powers, mental and
bodily, permit of it.
There in the Queensland shearing-shed was an
excellent library, maintained by voluntary sub-
scriptions of the workers and a Government sub-
sidy. After the day’s labor, the hands gathered
in their “School of" Arts”—their eating-room—
and, this time, sought food for their minds. The
book-case held English classics like Shakespeare,
Byron, Burns, etc., and if, it is true, I did not see
these often taken down, yet good English novels
(like those of Dickens, Ainsworth, etc.) and the
ethnographical works of Frazer had their friends
among the men. Especially glad was I to see
their affection for their own writers—otherwise so
sadly neglected : Lawson's splendid stories and
verses, Gordon 1 , Paterson, Ogilvie, Quinn, Brere-
ton —all spoke to the workers’ unsophisticated
feelings; and once I saw “ Middleton’s Rouse-
about ” going round the circle, carrying hope to
many a young man’s heart that some day, too,
honest toil would make him a master of Australian
soil.
On the tables lay Queensland and New South
Wales papers : it was a feast day whenever The
Bulletin arrived—that untiring champion of its
country and of the worker, ever ready to break a
lance with the defaulter of either ; and the Bris-
bane Worker, with its bitter words for present-
day social conditions, was gladly welcomed and
eagerly read.
Besides the readers, some tried their skill at
chess—and many a drawing-room player would
have found his master among them, If a whis-
pered conversation interrupted the reading or the
play, it was for a certainty about the bitter days
of Clermont, where the shearers fought and suf-
fered for the high ideal of workers’ brotherhood.
Quite different was the scene on the Victorian
goldfields. New deceptions every day, and yet
illusion refused to die ; the hour of rest was busied
with hopes for the hour that would realise the
faith in future that had been carried for years,
aye, for decades. Men sat there under the
gloomy eucalypts, around the fire that burned
before the tent, and spoke of the mysteries of
gold-digging, of friends that vanished or per-
ished, of times old and new : listened reverently
to the white-bearded miner with glittering eyes
who told of his early days in Ballarat,' where the
miners gave themselves the accolade as knights of
free democracy; then quickly turned their talk
back to the gold of their dreams. So, if I never
saw a book on the gold-fields, I can easily under-
stand-it; thejr own life is full of magic and
romance, and the poet’s fantasy would merely set
limits to their own. Scarcely even do they
allow the newspapers to disturb their golden
reverie. Narrow indeed is the world of print
when thought can rove unhindered from the very
origin of the earthly crust to the last fine uses of
the glittering gold.
J*
But if digging has its own charm and its own
accompaniment of dreams, if the spicy air of the''
bush gives the shearer new life and energy for
thought and reading, it is far different in the
factory. All that await the weary toiler are the
dusty air and mean streets of the workers’ quarter,
the bare crude home—nothing to wake him out of
his weariness, a weariness often as heavy as death,
or out of the dulness that is begotten .by the
montony of his task and the din of the factory.
If the handicrafts were once the centre of intellec-
tual life—Hans Sachs and the Meistersingers are
the well-known historical examples—the factory,
which has taken over their inheritance, is its
deadly foe. Scarcely fit to leave school, the boy
enters the horrid gloom of the machine-rooms, or
faces the glare of furnace and oven ; from the
very beginning he has no knowledge of the part
he plays in the general work; the more
perfect he grows in that part the narrower
becomes his field of activity, till finally
he wastes day after day, year after year,
in the repetition of a single mechanical trick.
What wonder if his brain dries up, if the dull and
blunted conditions of his bodily activity reproduce
themselves in his mental life, if he wastes time on
coarse, sensual pleasures, drink and gaming, or, if
he marries, takes a girl whose spirit has been
killed, like his own, in the factory, so that both
y see nothing in their married life but the chance of
easily-bought pleasure. “Spirit must brand the
flesh that, it may live,” says George Meredith—
but what is left alive in such a man as this ?
Naturally, then, he has little pleasure in serious
books; and the Australian press, whose diversity
could help it to be a great educational factor, has
lost all its influence over him. More than one work-
ing-man has told me that he was tired of wasting
a penny on papers that only seized the oppor-
tunity of every strike to scream at the arrogance
and insolence of the worker, to make heroes of
the blacklegs, who stab their fellow-workers in
the back, and to hurl the name of “criminals” at
the unionists who, through hunger and •self-
denial, lead on the van of social progress. The
factory-worker has no opportunity to hear his
own ideas defended in a daily paper, and weekly
publications like 'The Worker of Sydijey or Bris-
bane, however well conducted, bring him the
daily news too late, and rather too much abstract
socialistic matters in one heap. These seem to
be the reasons why these weeklies are so much
neglected.
J*
Colliery work, it is true, is less monotonous
and brain-destroying. But it is arduous physical
toil, and the conditions are unnatural—solitude
in a subterranean gloom. There is no need for
surprise, then, if the return to the upper light
and human companionship is a relief so intensely
to be enjoyed that quiet reading in a quiet room
is a thing unthought-of, and most prefer to chat
with their friends in a bar, or lounge idly along
the brilliant Streets. The only reading is the
scanty local paper—in the case of the immigrant,
very often that of his English rural home. If the
miner is a subscriber to a lending library, he will
be put off mostly with the lowest class of
English fiction, in which names like Corelli,
Boothby, Haggard shine out as lights, The lads,
of course, cannot afford such a subscription, and
destroy their taste with penny novels.
• A most necessary condition, then, which must
exist before the working classes can share in the
general culture of the nation, is the reduction of
the hours of labor in factory and mine, where
work-time should be estimated not only by the
amount of bodily exertion, but also by the soul-
murdering character of the task. Next, an
attempt must be made to meet the intellectual
demands of the people in every way ; for instance,
free popular libraries should be everywhere
established, as in America.
More important than this, perhaps, is the re-
form of, the evening amusements; and here
the State must help. It should introduce popular
concerts, subsidise a theatrical company and send
it on tour so that the people may, for a small
entrie, see pieces of educational value—for the
Australian stage ip flooded with dramatised
“blood and thunder” stories while the workers
of other countries nourish their minds with
Shaw, Wilde, Ibsen, Gorki, Maeterlinck, Anzen-
gruber, and Hauptmann, not to mention the
classics of each country.
A government that forbids gaming and drink-
ing must create amusements to take their place,
if it means to carry out a real social reform. The
State has full coffers : let it not then be miserly of
expenditure for the highest ideal good of the
people. At the present day the worker is often pre-
vented by the crushing or dulling nature of his
task from taking his seat at the table of culture ;
nothing is. done to arouse, to protect, or to nourish
his nobler instincts. Destroy the obstacles, and
the worker will take his part in your culture with
as much sympathy and delight as any.
DE ROBERT SOHACHNER.
(translated by 0. J. Brennan),
Mark Twain’s attack on “ Christian Science ”
is but a slight thing compared with the masterly-
history of the movement now being presented in
McClure!s by Georgina Mil mine. The history has
now reached the point where Mrs. Glover became
Mrs. Eddy. The founder of the new religion set
down her age in the marriage license as forty,
though this much-married lady was then 56. She
stated that a few years more or less were of no
consequence—-which merely shows that the new
prophet was a woman. Her new husband was a
sewing-machine agent, a quiet, dull little man,
who did all his own housework, even his washing,
and usually made his own trousers. “He could
do up a shirt as well as any woman.” Somehow,
that seems the sort of useful husband that a new
Mahometess would like to possess. Feminine
founders of religions are apt to forget to do up their
husband’s shirts. The history is singularly un-
biassed, and every stage in the eventful life of
this remarkable woman, and in the production
of her book, Science and Health, is attested by
contemporary evidence and documents, fehould
this new religion become a power in the land, as
Twain prophesies, the service done for future
ages by such a dispassionate and complete history
cannot be underestimated. It is curious to note
that the book, which has gone into such an
enormous number of editions, fell almost still-born
from the press, in some few instances being
handled severely by sarcastic reviewers.
In The Daughter of a Soldier and Other Stories
(J. A. Packer, Sydney), Agnes Littlejohn has re-
printed a number of short stories originally con-
tributed to The Presbyterian. They are the
sort of short stories that people who like to read
The Presbyterian would like to read.
“The way out of the present militaristic mad-
ness will be found by the first nation that takes
war seriously, or as the melodramatisers of war
will say, cynically. It has always been so. The
fiery Rupert, charging for God and the King, got
on excellently until Cromwell, having some experi-
ence as a brewer, made the trite experiment of
raising the wages of the Parliamentary soldier to
th'e market value of respectable men, and immedi-
ately went over Rupert like a steam-roller.
Napoleon served out enthusiasm, carefully mixed
with prospects of loot, as cold-bloodedly as a pirate
captain serves out rum, and never used it as an
efficient substitute for facts and cannon. Welling-
ton, with his characteristic Irish common sense,
held a steadfast opinion of the character of the
average British private, and the capacity of the
average British officer that would wreck the
Adelphi if uttered there; but he fed them care-
fully, and carried our point with them against the
enemy ” : — G. Bernard Pshaw.

So called because
the colors go right
through the material ,
so that the pattern
cannot wear off as
with ordinary Lino-

The great durability
of Inlaid Linoleum
renders it specially
suitable for Hotels,

covering is subjected
to hard street-like
wear.

Carpets and Linoleums should never be laid down without a layer of Felt underneath.
Its soft, thick substance makes Carpets and Linoleums feel much thicker and softer to
the tread, gives them a “spring” and elasticity under the foot which they cannot
otherwise have. It cushions and protects them from hard, uneven flooring, and makes
them last years longer, without signs of wear. Lies quite flat. Needs no fastening.

The
Evidence
from Bulli Point,
Bulli, N.S.W., Oct.
6th, 1905.
“My three little boys—Willie, aged
eight, John and Walter, aged four
—suffered from continual hacking
cough. Nothing seemed to do
them any lasting good, until I
gave Scott’* Emulsion a trial with
the best results. My little boys
have entirely lost the bad cough,
and Scott’s Emulsion has built
them up so thoroughly that they
are not like the same children,
being now restored to complete
good health. I shall always keep
a bottle of Scott’s in the house.”
Mrs. BROWN
The Reason Why
the Boys Throve
Magnificent materials, perfect
digestibility! This is all the
secret there is about Scott’s.
Neither advantage could be much
good without the other. Scott’s
secures both. Thanks to the
original Scott process of manu-
facture, the whole of the fine
Lofoten (Norwegian) cod liver oil
used in Scott’s passes
directly into the
tissues, first healing,
then invigoratingthem;
hence the extraordinary
record of lung, throat,
skin and blood cures.

The Girl.
And, after coming all this way.
You haven't got a word to say I
’Twas thus a maiden spoke to me
When walking by the summer sea.
And, ’ere I could collect a thought,
She told me of a hat she’d bought.
And how her aunt had come to stay,
And she herself might go away.
And why she didn’t like the dance,
And wasn’t “playing speaks” with Lance,
With Charlie or with Reginald
Because “ the silly fools ” had called,
And met each other on the mat
And scowled and left, and after that
She simply wouldn’t cross the street
To speak to them. If she should meet
“ Those awful boys ” out anywhere,
But—anyway she didn’t care !
Then—never pausing once for breath—
She told me she was sick to death
Of everything, and now and then
She simply “ loathed the sight of men.”
And wondered why she came with me
A-walking by the summer sea.
And, as she made this sort of fuss,
I felt a bit superfluous,
And prayed that Reginald and Lance,
And ev’ry other circumstance
That made her feel as if she’d die,
Would Then I heard her asking why
On earth I looked so very blue ?
And—“ Please, do say a word or two ! ”
And, looking down into her eyes,
I started to apologise.
When instantly, she said, “ Oh, wait
A second, dear ! ” and did relate
A story, intricate and long,
Of someone who had sung a song
To someone else, and then a lot
Of other sweet and precious rot,
That didn’t matter, anyhow.
Then —once again, the wrinkled brow,
And, “Really dear, it’s too absurd !
You never seem to say a word /”
And while I thought “That takes the
scone,”
She chattered and she clattered on,
Of all the people whom she knew
(I daresay it’s been done to you !),
And so it came to pass that I
Said but four words : “Good-day,” “Good-
bye.”

My True Love is in Town.
Grey the meadows are to me,
And blue skies dull and drear;
How can any color be
When she I love’s not here ?
How this changeless, cynic sun
Beats me beneath his frown !
Softer are those skies of dun—
My true love is in town.
Lone and long the country lanes;
Although the song-birds sing,
Still a solitude remains ;
The dark is menacing.
Dearer is the tumult where
She wanders up and down ;
Streets and pavements lead to her —
My true love is in town.
When the streets in grey mist whirled
To nothingness have come,
When the rain across the world
Smudges a slanting thumb ;
When the steely pavements wet
Black shadows deeply drown,
London is the sweetest yet—
My true love is in town.
N.S.W.
ARTHUR H. ADAMS.
The How and Why.
Far amid the Asian mountains,
In the aeons long gone by,
Sat an animal, half human,
Naked, hairy Man or Woman—
Pondering on How and Why.
Next, in Babylon and Memphis,
Gazed the sages on the sky,
And of Heaven-fire and thunder,
Of the stars and winds in wonder
Asked the ceaseless How and Why.
Greek and Roman, speculating,
Still conceived an answer nigh,
Still believed their human reason
Would, in fit and proper season,
Show them of the How and Why.
And to-day the priest and parson
Bids mankind no longer sigh.
They are wiser than the ages,
They are giants to the sages—
They have solved the How and Why.
But the heart spurns metaphysics.
Greeds are short-lived—soon they die,
And we theorise but vainly,
We but dogmatise inanely
On the How and Whence and Why.

How to Address Betters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the paper
(and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some care as to
methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, advertise-
ments, etc.) should in no case be addressed to the Editor,
but to the Manager. To send them to the Editor is to
invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The Editor, Bulletin,” is the proper
superscription for “ copy." Delay, and even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of
officials. The person may not be there ; the official
always is.
Special Notice.
Insufficiently stamped letters are liable to be refused.
The contents of this paper are copyright by the pub-
lishers. The right to reproduce or translate any part of
the contents of this number is hereby expressly reserved by
the publishers.
The Editor will carefully read and, ivhere practicable,

JEHOVAH AND THE GREAT
LANDLORD.
Some 3400 years ago, if the Scriptural authority is
to be relied upon, Jehovah handed down to His
people a land system, along with a moral code and
a mass of other regulations. It is the one recorded
instance in which the Deity whom Christendom
professes to worship did such a thing; as there
was no further manifestation of the kind, it is
presumed that the policy then enunciated was
good enough for all time—or at least for time as
far as it has got. It was handed down, certainly,
to only one people, but then everything that is
handed down at all must be handed to somebody.
And the revelation was made to the same people
who received the Ten Commandments, and was
made under similar conditions. If the land policy
that was drafted for Israel in the wilderness
was meant exclusively for Israel, then it is
a fair inference that the Ten Commandments
were also for Israel alone, and that the huge
majority which is not Israel is under no prohibi-
tion against murder, theft, and the annexation of
it’s neighbor’s wife. Certainly it is impossible to
hold to the whole letter of the law that was given
to Jacob’s posterity in the wilderness. The rules
dealing with Levites can hardly be followed by
races which, having no kin with Levi, couldn’t
raise a Levite to save their lives. The laws con-
cerning leprosy became extinct in many countries
because even the most strenuous fishing wouldn’t
bring as much as a single leper to the surface of
the sea of events. The immensity of rules and
regulations about the management of the famous
tabernacle can no longer be observed because the
tabernacle has been missing since beyond the
memory of man, and even the smallest remnant
of it can’t be identified. The New Testament
obliterated in one act all the miscellaneous laws
as to sacrifice. But the old Decalogue, and the
old land law, and the old financial regula-
tions were never annulled, nor did anything
ever happen to make them definitely obsolete.
While sin remains the Decalogue will fill the bill
as a moral code ; while the land remains the land
laws of Jehovah, given to the same people who
received the Decalogue, will remain a work-
able code. Time and Circumstances extinguished
the Ark, and the Temple, and the Urim and
Thummin ; and the Cities of Refuge ceased to be
distinguished because every city in every civilised
country became a City of Refuge in the old
Hebrew sense ; but something must survive unless
it is held that all that memorable and most wonder-
ful code of ancient law was mere waste time
and labor. And the things that naturally remain
are those which were never revoked, which were
never made impossible by change of circum-
stances, and which were equally applic tble to all
time and all countries.
* * * *
It is notable that in the land laws of Jehovah
there were no signs of the landlord or the big
estate, and for the rent problem it had no room at
all. It was essentially a system of small free-
holds each cultivated by the owner. That owner
was to sit under his own vine and fig-tree, not
under the landlord’s bit of hired shade. Jehovah
was the first advocate of closer settlement, the
first denouncer of land monopoly, the first and
bitterest opponent of great estates. So anxious
was He to prevent the aggregation of great hold-
ings that He even forbade the acquisition by one
man of another’s farm by purchase; as regards
country lands there was set aside a year of release
every half-century, and the most that could be
done in the way of the alienation of country lands
was to sell the use of them until the year of
release—that great cleaning up, when the
poor were to come into their own again, and
the congestion of wealth was to be checked, and
the nation was to make a fresh start. Town
properties might be sold—something of the sort
was inevitable for business purposes, though even
in such cases the seller had a year in which to
consider the situation, and any time within that
period he might buy back the property, appa-
rently at the purchase price; but the country
lands were portioned out in. small lots to the
Hebrew families at the beginning of things, and
were made inalienable by Divine command. And
so fixed was the Divine law against the aggrega-
tion of great estates that the lending of money at
interest by one Hebrew to another was forbidden.
If it had been permitted, the wonderful processes
of compound interest would tend to make the
rich man, even if he couldn’t legally acquire the
fee simple of the poor man’s land, the perpetual
mortgagee in possession, so even 2| per cent, was
made unlawful. There was an eloquent prohibition
against the removal of a neighbor’s landmark ; and
in later years, when Israel had fallen away from
the law, the most brilliant of its prophets called
down woe on the Clabkes and Manifolds
and the A.A. Co. and the Peel River Co. of that
day—those who “join house to house, that lay
field to field ” ; he classed the big landlord with
the drunkard, and declared that hell had been
enlarged to accommodate them both.
* * • *
It was a wonderful agrarian law—that which
the old Jewish God handed down along with the
Decalogue from Sinai; and it has justified itself
all through history. Every country which has
refused to accept it, or which has fallen away
from it, has been harassed by agrarian revolts or
dry-rotted with internal decay. The saying that
“ Great estates ruined Italy,” as describing
the fall of the Roman empire, has passed
into a byword ; there weren’t enough land-
lords to hold up the eagles, and the
mere Roman with the hoe had lost all interest in
the eagles. The same trouble wrecked Poland.
The Polish landowners couldn’t keep back the
enemy —moreover, being a race besotted with
riches and in the habit of devoting their lazy,
wasted, bloated hours to intrigue and internal
feuds, many of them had forgotten the very
meaning of patriotism \ and as for the serf the
Pole with the hoe—one master was the same to
him as another. Great estates and great fortunes
ruined Babylon; the landlord forgot how to sit
his war-horse because he was too fat, and the
Babylonian with the hoe reckoned that any
change of masters might be a change for the
better. Great estates have depopulated Ireland,
and they are helping England to its fall
by making its people less and less of
a sturdy out - door - living community, and
more and more a race of wharf rats
and slum-dwellers. Everywhere the Divine
agrarian law has wonderfully vindicated itself,
or is in the act of vindicating itself.
And every reformer, and alleged reformer, tacitly
admits the fact more or less. Even the bitter
Tory of the Argus stamp urges the people to get
on the land, though in his desire to preserve the
fortunes of the great stealers of the people’s
heritage he wants them to get there by paying
impossible prices for the land. The fact is every-
where recognised that the basis and foundation of
a strong community is a large, prosperous, and
contented agricultural population. Many other
things are needed, but that is required first of all.
And it is a dead certainty that such a population
is not to be found when the man on the land is a
mere rack-rented tenant. Also it is a certainty
that such a population is to be found in its best
form amid a community of intelligent small pro-
prietors. In that respect Jehovah is justified of
His agrarian policy, the policy which regenerated
Denmark, and enabled Switzerland to retain its
independence against all Europe, and which made
the Transvaal Republic so strong that its people
—who, all told, wouldn’t make the population of
a second-rate city—could hold the world’s biggest
empire at bay for three years, and even then had
to be paid to surrender.
$ * * *
There is no intention to make this a theological
article; the exact splitting of the theological hair
is best left to priests and parsons, and such-like
folk, who possess the necessary implements. It
may be that the old agrarian law of Jehovah
was only intended for local application, or that
it has somehow died out in the effluxion of
years. If the Church says so, this paper will let the
matter pass at that, merely pointing out that ip
saying so the Church accepts the biggest responsi-
bility ever shouldered by man, for if the Old
Testament decree against the accumulation of
great estates has died out, then it is just as
probable that the Ten Commandments have also
died out, and that Geokge Chirnside, and the
owner of the Bibbenluke Estate, and the Duke
of Sutherland, and all the race of great landed
proprietors can be murdered without any moral
responsibility attaching to the perpetrator of the
act. Nor, in quoting the burning words of
Isaiah, the prophet, that there is a curse upon
those who add house to house and field to field,
and that hell has been enlarged to contain them
and their kind, is there any absolute intention of
asserting that the men who dummied huge estates
all over Monaro, and the landlords who piled up
vast properties in the Western District of Vic-
toria are irretrievably lost. But if they are not,
then it can only be because that section of the
Scripture has been written off as a bad debt, and
if one section can be thus obliterated, then the
same may happen to any other section, and the
whole fabric of Christianity totters on its basis, and
all priesthood and parsondom threaten to become
dead things and of no account. Certain sections
of the Church are already dead and of no account.
They are the allies of the great landlord, and eat
his rich food and drink his rich wine, and
denounce any attempt to get back to the vicinity
of the old Hebrew agrarian law as confiscation
and Socialism. And in so doing they forget that
Jehovah, Whose whole system was designed to
promote the equality of man in the Hebrew
Federation, was apparei tly the founder of bocial-
ism, and its first practical Teacher.
» * * *
In Australia there is a party which recognises
that there is prospective ruin in the accumulation
of great estates, in the creation of a small body ot
loafing landlords, and a vast horde of rack-rented
tenants, in the holding of vast areas against settle-
ment to gratify the greed and vanity of the great
monopolist, in the building up of a few vast
fortunes which can only come to pass through the
impoverishment of the multitude. It has tor
its supporters a multitude of historical examples,
and behind them the old Law and the old Pro-
phets. And it has for its opponents the great
landlords, the Tory press, Bruce Smith, the
Women’s League, and certain sections ot the
Church. The matter seems to be, to a great
extent, Bruce Smith and the Women’s League
and Janet Mrs. Clarke versus the Old Testa-
ment. The Democratic party, which the aristo-
cratic section of the Church denounces as a party of
Socialism and Confiscation, aims in a mild way at
restoring the old agrarian and financial laws of
Jehovah —the laws which created a race of small
proprietors, which prohibited the exaction of in-
terest, which prohibited the accumulation of
great estates, which prevented the little farm
being seized by the creditor in perpetuity,
which declared that if a creditor seized
the debtor’s raiment it must be restored
before nightfall, which made the widow’s goods
sacred even against her creditor, which abolished
the bailiff by enacting that no man could enter
a house and take possession of the contents, and
which prohibited the taking for debt of any article
necessary for the debtor’s support. Yet the
crowd which upholds the religious side of the
argument in the great case of the Women s
League and Bruce Smith and J anet Mrs.
Clarke versus the Old Testament, is quite mode-
rate in its proposals as compared with Isaiah, the
prophet. His remedy for the great landlord was
damnation. It proposes, at the worst, a
graduated land-tax, with a maximum of 4d. m
the £, and a £5OOO exemption. There is a
quaint and philosophical toleration about the
party that aims at the breaking up of the
great estates in Australia, and its tolera-
tion is little appreciated by its opponents.
These same opponents, who have a curious ha.bit
of borrowing GrOD to bolster up their iniquities,
don’t seem to have any idea that the old sacred
law is meant for everyday use, and when it is
propounded to them, they take refuge in wild
assertions that the other party desires to “break
up the sanctity of the home.” Also when the
tenets of the Scripture are brought into common
use—when they are quoted against the land
monopolist, the usurer, the adulterator, and the
short-weight fiend of modern life—it has a con-
venient habit of saying that such practical appli-
cation of the Scripture is “ blasphemy.” Probably
even this dissertation on the old Hebrew agrarian
and financial law will be described in Tory circles
as “blasphemy.”
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Another Loan Curse Looming.
In explanation of the large increase under “ New Works
and Build.ngs,” I would remind the committee that since
the establishment of Federation Parliament has reso-
lutely set its face against loan expenditure, thus
necessitating the outlay of considerable sums out of the
revenue, which would otherwise be charged to loans.
Of course this is a state of things which will not continue
indefinitely, as in the event of the Commonwealth under-
taking large works, such as the transcontinental railway,
it will be found absolutely necessary to have recourse to
loan expenditure.—Australian Treasurer Lyne in his
Financial Statement.
In most political matters The Bulletin has the
pleasure of finding itself at one with William
Lyne —Big William, the sturdy battler from
N.S.W., who has kept up the honor and credit of
his State while small, weary Cook and Kelly
people would fain have dragged it in the mire.
But here, for a time, this paper and William
Lyne part company. It may be that the Com-
monwealth will be driven to borrow part of the
money (a small part, it is to be hoped, with a big
sinking fund attached) for the construction of the
two absolutely imperative transcontinental rail-
ways, and for the opening up of the Northern
Territory, but it will require a tremendous lot of
evidence to prove the fact. And, of course, the
Commonwealth can’t keep quite out of debt, for
it will take over a ready-made debt along with
the Territory, and it will also have to
assume that' bit of the South Australian
debt which represents the value of the
Port Augusta-Oodnadatta railway; but it will re-
quire a whole ship-load of evidence tb prove that
it need remain in that debt any longer than the
day when the debentures fall due, or even so long
as that if arrangements can be made with the de-
benture-holders. Why should Lyne— always
known as a big, hopeful, sanguine William—
propose to give up the honest and solvent ghost
without a struggle? There are necessarily vast
expenditures ahead (there are also vast revenues
by reason of these expenditures), for the recon-
struction of Australia has just commenced; but
the Commonwealth has already done wonders in
the way of meeting out of revenue great liabilities
for public works, which the old corrupt State
Governments used to charge to loans, and it
hasn’t yet got nearly to the end of its possibili-
ties. The fact that there are great things to be
done is merely a reason why the Government
should take stock of its great resources in good
time. At present there are, or should be, these
matters to be provided for
(1) Cost of the transcontinental (or alleged transcon-
tinental) railway to Kalgoorlie.
(2) Cost of the transcontinental railway from Oodna-
datta to Pine Creek on a sft. Sin. gauge, suitable for
swift traffic.
(3) Purchase of the railways from Port Augusta to
Oodnadatta and from Port Darwin to Pine Creek, and
their conversion into a broad gauge line suitable for the
swiftest kind of traffic. (It may also be necessary to take
over the narrow-gauge line from Pt. Augusta to Terowie,
where the S. Australian broad-gauge ends, and turn that
into a sft. 3in. line, too.)
(4) Interest and sinking fund on the Territory’s debt.
(5) A considerable annual vote for making roads and
surveys in the Territory, cutting up land for farms, and
bringing in a swarm of desirable settlers.
(6) A large annual vote for the construction of an Aus-
tralian navy, for small arms and ammunition works, and
cannon foundries, and for the establishment of a citizen
soldiery.
(7) As an item which must come along some day, the
taking over of the State debts, and the establishment of
a general sinking fund.
These are the burdens the Commonwealth has to
face, and even with all these troubles ahead there
is as yet no reason to recklessly sky the financial
towel in despair. Let the Commonwealth con-
sider its present and possible resources :
(1) The surplus now returned to the States over and
above the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise
revenue to which they are entitled. This amount
will be increased under the new tariff—for a while at
least.
(2) Any further gain which may accrue through a
re-arrangement of affairs with the States when the Brad-
don clause expires in 1910.
(3) The revenue (when it begins to come in) from the
two transcontinental railways. .
(4) The revenue (when it begins to arrive) froni Cus-
toms, Excise, lands, mining royalties, etc., in the Terri-
(s) Proceeds of a heavy Federal graduated land-tax for
the breaking up of big estates.
(6— possibly) Proceeds of a Federal income-tax.
(7) The monej' that might be raised by the adoption of
the Canadian banking system, whereby the banks are re-
quired to hold 40 per cent, of theircash reserves in Govern-
ment notes. This would yield something approaching
£10,000,000, and after establishing a gold reserve of, say,
£2,000,000, there would still be enough money available to
pay off the debt of the Northern Territory in one act, and
probably to build one railway as well.
There are other possibilities in the way of raising
revenue, but so far as these suggestions go, they
represent the debtor and creditor side of the case.
And it isn’t a hopeless ease by any means. If the
Australian Government looks ahead, and starts
to collect money together in good time, it should
have a million or two in hand when the first large
item of expense comes along, and should also
know where to lay its hand promptly on many
more millions, without any necessity for thinking
of a loan. The Bulletin urges W. Lyne not
to give way to despair in a financial sense. There
is still hope.
«
The Howl of the Importer.
When the new tariff was announced there was at
first a stunned silence on the part of the im-
porter. He found that at last Australia had got
something that looked like a really Protective
poliey, and it took him 24 hours to get his wind.
At the end of the 24 hours, he drew a deep breath
and delivered himself of a record squeal. But, to
his honor be it said, his squeal was not on his
own account. All his agony was due to the
thought of the sufferings of the poor dear people
under the terrible blow. The increased duties,
said the collective importer, would, of course, be
paid by the consumer. They always were. Some
of the tarradiddles told by the party in the pot
hat as to the impossibility of Australia making
anything for itself, and as to the absolute neces-
sity to keep on importing and paying the ruinous
duty, were humorous. Buzacott & Co. on the
impossibility of making such a simple thing as a
fishing net in Australia: “Made here? No!
There are no fishing nets made here. If there
were it would only mean the employment
of a few girls; but the business would not
pay for putting in the plant.” And yet,
during 1906, the value of the fishing nets im-
ported into Australia —the value at the port of
shipment—was £4751, which probably means
three times that sum to the public. Surely
£14,253 worth of fishing nets is worth employing
a few girls to make. Cusack, of the firm of
Bennett and Wood, lifted up the same derisive
snort re bicycle chains and tubing. Said the
Cusack: “A chain factory, if established in
Australia, would make sufficient chains in two
hours to supply the whole Commonwealth, and it
would cost £BO,OOO or £lOO,OOO to put up tube
mills in Australia, and when they had run one
hour they would have made more tubing than the
whole Commonwealth required.” Let’s see :In
1906 there were imported into Australia chains
worth, at the port of shipment, £49,329, and a
plant that makes bicycle chains could make others
as well. Just imagine a plant turning out chains
of the wholesale value of £49,329 in two hours.
If Cusack were not too slow to overtake a lame
caterpillar he would have started a plant long
ago—and set to work to make money with it at
the rate of £4ll per minute !! ! The figures for
tubing are not available, but the value, at the
port of shipment, of bicycle parts for making up
into bikes, tricycles, and similar vehicles amounted
to £183,749. This little lot would probably be
turned out in about six hours by the Cusack
patent brand of plant. Another importer, who
had the good sense not to give his name for pub-
lication, wailed re pianos : “It simply means this,
that all but the wealthy classes will have to put
up with inferior instruments... or go without.”
So notwithstanding that Beale, of Sydney, is
already making pianos of sufficient excellence
to be installed in the home of the Governor-
General, there is no hope of Australia making
its own music-box. Last year 12,263 pianos,
worth, at the port of shipment, £241,357,
were despatched to Australia. So the average
wholesale value of the piano that is imported into
Australia is £l9 13s. lid. Judging by these
figures, the importer gives but a very poor class
of piano after all, so it is doubtful, in the face of
the figures (which are from the Commonwealth
Trade and Customs Returns for 1906), if the people
will have to put up with much inferior pianos
because of the duty. Apparently, the present
piano is so darned bad that it couldn’t
well be worse. Another wild importer’s agent
declared that if a decent woollen mill was started
in Australia it would make all the woollens re-
quired in the Commonwealth in six months, but
under no conditions could it possibly make them
as good as they are made in England and on the
continent of Europe. The woollen importations
for 1906 were worth, at the port of shipment,
£2,083,754, which means in round figures, that the
consumers paid £6,000,000 for them. A factory
that could turn out that value in six months
could afford to shut up for the rest of the year.
The general result of the wail of the importer is to
leave the public wondering if the importer is as
big a fool as he seems to be, or if he takes the
community to be the out-size in imbeciles that he
appears to the public to be.
Some Fish Stories That Didn’t Hang Together.
Before it starts to tell its story, a fishing party
really ought to see that there isn’t aboard any
stupid person who has an outrageous habit of tell-
ing the truth, even if the truth is only a catfish.
The other day the over-sea steamship cos. put up
their saloon fares 10 per cent. Of course, the
Foreign-trade dailies stuck , the news under the
wails about the tariff. Also Anderson, of the
Orient Co., said the tariff “may have been a con-
tributing factor” ; and Wesche, of the P. and 0.,
“wasn’t prepared to say” that it wasn’t; and
Loth, of the Messageries Maritimes, said that
various things, “with the tariff added in Aus-
tralia also,” were responsible. Then Boner, of
the Nord Deutscher Lloyd, who hadn’t been told
what the fishing party was supposed to say, told
his yarn. Authorities in Great Britain as well as
in Germany wereinsistingon better accommodation
for crews, he said, and the Newcastle coal cos. had
formed a combine and put up coal 2s. per ton,,
and labor conditions (he was talking of Europe)
were much more stringent, and, from about the
time of the Russo-Jap war, prices had been moving
up; so the companies’ managers in Europe had
long been in communication about the matter,
“and finally 22 cos., including many of those
trading to Australia, agreed to raise the passenger
rates. The only port the increased charges, it
seems, do not apply to is Capetown.” So, besides
blowing out the miserable little insinuation that
the tariff was responsible for this too (though even
if it was it really wouldn’t be much to weep over),
the Nord Deutscher Lloyd man at the same time


knocked tlie bottom out of those comparisons of
prices with which the Foreign-traders have
been deluding the crowd; for this steamship
manager explains that, quite apart from the
tariff, prices have been going steadily upwards
even in Freetrade countries. The only place where
managers see they can’t hope to get any bigger
fares is Cape Town—the port of the country that
was going to be made fat and prosperous by a flood
of the same sort of cheap colored labor that some
Chamber of Commerce people want for the Nor-
thern Territory, and which, instead of being made
fat and prosperous, has been made so miserable
and depressed that the steamship cos. can’t apply
an otherwise-universal rule to it. Moreover, it
apparently never occurred to the stupid Foreign-
trade claquers that the rise in fares was a good
reason for staying at home, and keeping our
goods at home. “Goods, of course, do not need
food,” said the wise S.M. Herald, “but the extra
cost of coal, and the increased wages of crews,
must be debited to cargo as well as to passen-
gers.” Wherefore, if Australia has to pay more
for having its wool humped to Europe in bales,
and then humped back again in cloth, the sensible
thing to do is to put on a duty that will establish
factories, and make the humping unnecessary.
«.
The Poor Man’s Troubles.
A feature of the Victorian end of the Foreign-
trade opposition to the new tariff was the tre-
mendous anxiety expressed by almost every
opponent as to the effect the tariff would have
upon “the poor man.” The Argus had big, black
headings, “Wage-Earners Hard Hit,” “Cost of
Living Increased,” and it denounced, with much
indignation, the attempt to raise the price of the
poor man’s necessaries :
The working man will inevitably notice a perceptible
growth in his food bill and his clothing accounts. . .
There must be hard lighting in and out of Parliament to
prevent the burdens on the . . . great army of small
wage-earners being increased without any compensating
advantage accruing to the Federation.
The Argus, of course, does not consider the
establishment of scores or hundreds of new fac-
tories a “ compensating advantage.” T-he journal
then, unfortunately, went into details, and got
some of them from the managing director of
Paterson, Laing and Bruce (the big fluff ware-
housemen). The director was even more indig-
nant than the Argus :
Denims, which used to be five per cent., had been
raised to 35 per cent. These were almost entirely used
by mechanics, ENGINE-DRIVERS and other workers ;
but it seemed to be determined that they should not be
allowed to use this cheap material.
And yet the Argus that same morning had
printed, in its tariff list, the following
Cotton, linen, dungaree, denims (other than striped
and fancy), moleskins and corduroys—British, 5 per cent. :
other, 10 per cent.
So that there is actually no increase at all on
denims if imported (as most of them are now)
from Britain, unless the mechanic w r ears striped
and fancy denims; and he doesn’t do that
as a rule. On the morning following the
announcement of the tariff, there was a whole
row of weeping importers on the Argus doorstep,
and without exception they ascribed their tears
to the awful prospect of the poor man. Some
sample weeps:—
Beath, Schiess & Co.—“ The new tariff would mean a
heavy increase in the cost of living, particularly to the
workers.’’
D. &W. Murray (weep No. 2).—“ There could be no
question that the bulk of the increased cost of living
would fall on the poorer people.”
Paterson, Laing & Bruce (weep No. 3). —“ At the
present time all the better class of blankets were made
locally; only the lower-priced blankets, such as the local
factories did not make, were imported. The poorer
classes, who were the sole customers for these goods
would have to pay a higher price.”
Thus do Fluff & Co. weep because for the future
it will be difficult to import shoddy blankets—
blankets made mostly of cotton—and sell them to
the worker. Until the Federal Commerce Act
came into force it was quite a habit to swindle
the poor working man by selling him these
blankets as all wool, and no importer cared
a tinker s malediction for the poor worker
then. He was taken down remorselessly. Quite
a number of importers, dealers and traders
have had to be pulled up at various times
for defrauding the “poorer classes” by selling
them goods that weren’t up to description. Then
one of the burdens upon the “ poorer people ” in
the city is the extra taxes they have to pay
because the importer’s friend, the rich country-
landlord, declines to pay his water rates, and per-
suades the Government to charge the poor toiler
for quite a lot of the cost of the roads that he
should pay for himself. These rich people in Vic-
toria who are so broken up about the “ poorer
classes” could relieve them quite a lot by becom-
ing honest in their dealings with the Government,
and by lowering rents, and by ceasing to oppose a
reasonable systeni of old-age pensions. And
then, as a side issue, consider the Tory Argus
weeping to-day over the increase—quite an
imaginary increase—in the duty on some kinds of
clothes largely used by engine-drivers, and con-
sider also the amount of sympathy that same
paper gave to the engine-drivers in the stormy
strike days of 1903 ! The Argus weeping over an
engine-driver is a record hypocrisy.
«
Glass and Bottles.
The Bulletin hears from a manufacturer— R. J
Connelly, of the Federal Flint Glass and Bottle
Works Co., Sydney :
The Sydney daily press has been making a final flutter
to stir up some interest in a lost cause. Since the an-
nouncement of the tariff a number of interviews with im-
porters have been published. All of them say just what
everybody knew they would say. Id wasn’t likely that
the men who have made their tens of thousands of
pounds out of the huge profits on goods bought at the
other end of the earth would say anything else ! But let
any firm start to make the goods on which these lar°-e
profits were secured, and down would come their prices
at once—until the manufacturers were cleared out of the
way ; then the original prices would be brought to light
again. °
Having represented the flint-glass trade of this State
before th<? Tariff Commission, I counselled the trade to
make only fair and reasonable requests. This was done
with the result that the proposals have been adopted in
their entirety. We ask for the duty to be applied at per
cubic foot outside measurement of case, and hope that
this will not be departed from for the following reasons :
—A German manufacturer starts by giving his factory
cost. His works may be 200 miles inland from the coist
and the cost of transit to the ocean steamer is a charge
on which duty can be demanded. Nevertheless that
charge doesn’t appear on the invoice. But to reduce
even the factory cost a very large buying commission
appears on the invoice. After that come a series of dis-
counts—lo per cent., 5 per cent., per cent. A deduc-
tion is then made for cases altogether out of proportion
to their cost in Germany. A further rebate is made of
from 2£ per cent, to 5 per cent. Some of these charges
and deductions are bogus, and when they are not bog’us
they are enormously inflated. Hence, we ask that the
duty be based on measurement only, which will allow of
no manipulation.
We started manufacturing in this State about 10 vears
ago, but soon found out that, under the old conditions
a manufacturer was only another name for a fool. We
then started importing in conjunction, with the result
that, had the tariff been delayed much longer, I should
have developed into a Freetrader, so very little exertion
being 1 required to make a living that way. But if the
tariff in its application to flint glassware passes in its
present form we will stop importing right now, we will
increase our hands right away, and we will make the
goods on the spot, with no increase in prices, relying on
an increased output to recompense us for the duty we
will have to pay on any materials which cannot be produced
locally.
The Starved Australian Factories.
“ Deposits,” said aForeign-trade, paper the other
day, talking about the latest banldng statistics—
“ deposits are still £19,368,938 in excess of the
advances. A good portion of this excess lies at
the credit of various banks in London.” Also it
mentioned that there is £23,711,427 of gold and
bullion lying in the banks’ vaults. A few months
ago the advances —-that is, the money out and in
use—were much less even than they are now, and
there was a larger difference between deposits
and advances. But, finding no other investment,
the men who own the money have either bought
land with it, or lent it to somebody else to buy
land, at increased prices. And increased prices for
land don’t add one farthing to the wealth
or the wealth-producing power of the coun-
try ; a farm won’t produce a blade more
grass, or put as much as a pound on
to its pumpkin crop, because in a jobbing trans-
action in Pitt-street or Castlereagh-street some-
body has given 10s. an acre more for it than it
fetched last year. The bulk of the increased ad-
vances have gone that way ; very little, indeed,
has gone in providing machinery and works to
manufacture some of the £42,398,589 worth of
goods (exclusive of specie and bullion) which
Australia imported last year. The Bulletin
tries to keep on the track of all joint-stock com-
panies formed for all sorts of purposes in Austra-
lasia, and in the past 12 months it has overhauled
more than 1000 balance-sheets; but there hasn’t
been one manufacturing co. added to the list.
And from the records of those that are on the
list, nobody can wonder at it. Manufacturing
concerns fall under three headings; they are dei
voted to the production of food, clothes, or tools.
Take, then, a typical case from each divi-
sion to see what inducement there was
under the old tariff to put more capital
into that sort of investment. First as to
food. The best-known co. is Swallow and
Ariell, founded in Victoria under the Protection
of the old State tariff. For the past five years it
has paid altogether 3f per cent, on its capital, or
an average of three-quarters of 1 per cent, per
annum (15s. dividend on each £100). That is
very alluring! On its ordinary shares the
S. Hoffnung Co., which imports things
from Germany, Britain, and elsewhere, paid
14 per cent, for the past year—say 18i times
the manufacturing concern’s average. Turning
to the next division—clothing—there is the
Queensland Woollen Mills, Ltd. That co. paid
H Per cent, in 1901; it has not paid a farthing
since. The Parramatta Woollen Co. has had much
the same experience; it has paid nothing since 1903.
The Castlemaine Co. has been paying 3 per cent.,
and even then appears to be wearing out its
machinery and not providing for its replacement
out of capital. The Ballarat Co., the most success-
ful of all the Australian woollen cos., is paying 5
per cent, on the capital actually put into it; the
dividend is represented as 10 per cent, because in
the early struggle to establish the business half
the capital was written off. In the third division,
Mort’s Dock and Engineering Co., of Sydney’
stands in a singularly favorable position; yet 6
per cent, is this company’s maximum. Other
cos., less favorably situated, have either gone into
liquidation or merely hang on in the expectation
that Australia will see the folly of allowing its
own industries to be crushed out of existence.
Before the new tariff was announced, James
Martin & Co., Ltd., of Gawler (S.A.), whose
machinery works were, a few years ago, under the
S. Aus. State tariff, the biggest in the Com-
monwealth, had called a meeting to con-
sider voluntary liquidation. Walker’s, Ltd.,
of Queensland, has paid no dividend since
the old Queensland State tariff went in 1901.
Every branch of Australian manufacturing in-
dustry tells the same tale. Australia supports
many factories, but they are foreign factories; it
employs hundreds of thousands of workmen, but
they are foreign workmen; it has millions for
investment, but, on the admission of the Foreign-
trade paper, £23,711,427 lies in the vaults of the
banks in Australia, while vast sums are also “at
the credit of the various banks in London”—
financing industries there, in other words, instead
of here; employing labor there instead of here.
And then Australia wonders why it doesn’t get
population!

The Fresh Outbreak of Joseph.
All last week there rose at intervals the uncouth
dog-howl of Joseph Carruthers complaining
about “Victoria,” and weeping bitterly. If it
were possible to suppose that the undignified
N.S.W. Premier believes his own tales, then it
would really seem that “Victoria” has become
with him a mental disease, or hallucination, or
form of dementia—a possession by an evil spirit
after the manner of the Gadarene swine, the
“ fixed idea ” which leads ultimately to lunacy—
something akin to the devils which holy but un-
washed men of old saw in the deserts and waste
places. For instance, if the theory of wilful lying,
petty slander, and a savage desire to stir up strife
and make Australians hate one another is left out
of the question, and if the assumption that
Joseph is suffering from an almost impossible
amount of ignorance is held to be untenable, on
what sane or sober basis could this tale be
accounted for ?
In regard to the increased duty on wire netting, Mr.
Carruthers remarked yesterday that there was an impres-
sion that a factory for the manufacture of this article
existed in Victoria ; but this Was a mistake, and the mat-
ter was thus made much worse. “ The Government
determined two years ago,” said he, “to manufacture
wire netting in the prisons, and machines for the work
were ordered from manufacturers at Auburn, and are
now being made in New South Wales. So that the
netting is to be made by Victorian prisoners, and thus
the farmers will have the consolation of knowing that in
paying this 35 per cent, extra duty they are giving more
employment to prisoners in the Victorian gaols. They
are to submit to the rabbits and dingoes and other ver-
min, in order that the people in the gaols in Victoria may
have more work.”
Now even the most malevolent insect should
know that a gaol industry doesn’t require Protec-
tion, for the simple reason that it has gratis
labor, and that it isn’t charged rent for the gaol,
nor gas bills, nor taxes ; it has only to pay for raw
material, so it can compete easily in an open
market. That is one point on which the snarling,
fish-fag Premier set himself to mislead the public.
The other point is his deliberate suppression of
the fact that the wire-netting manufacture in
Australia is, except for any trifle of netting that
may be made in the future in Victorian gaols, ex-
clusively a N.S.W. industry. It was established
in the old sham “Freetrade ” days by the simple
process of putting a duty of £3 per ton
on the imported article, and it still sur-
vives, and employs something like 400 hands.
The great Lysaght firm, of Sydney, turns out a
splendid article that sells all over Australia, and
with the Australian market secured to it the
Lysaght firm might be ten or twenty times the
size jit is, and employ 4000 or 8000 hands, and be
able not only to supply Australia, but to compete
in foreign markets. But the miserable Car-
ruthers—traitor even to his own State and his
own city—didn’t so much as mention Lysaght’s
concern; apparently his Freetrade hatred of
Australian manufactures extends even to the
point of ignoring Sydney manufactures. The
Victorian and Queensland and S.A. Protectionists
are ready and willing to advocate Protection for
the exclusively N.S.W. industry of piano-making,
and the almost exclusively N.S.W. wire-netting
industry, and to pay bounties to the N.S.W. iron
industry, and to help along with tariff aid the
N.S.W. sugar industry ; they do this because they
are Australians, and these are, in their view,
simply Australian industries. And, in return for
their willingness to help the N.S.W. wire-netting
industry all they know, the Victorians receive the
coarse insults of Carruthers, who seems to have
left all political decency behind him, and become
in his public capacity a naked maniac running
amok. How N.S.W. comes to tolerate this squall-
ing, ill-mannered kid at the head of its State
affairs passes comprehension.

Oil, etc.
The Argus, lamenting over the working-man’s
wife:—
All her purveyors had followed the example of the
Colonial Sugar Company, which on Saturday morning-
advertised that treacle and golden syrup had been ad-
vanced in prices 30s. per ton , as a consequence of the
duty of 30s. per ton, and she knew that the rise would
mean at least a halfpenny a pound, to her.
It is only a few weeks since it was announced
that the C.S.R. Co. had to run thousands of tons
of Australian-made treacle to waste every year
owing to there being no market for it. In view
of this fact, the above announcement is nothing
short of scandalous. The co., without a word of
reproach from the Argus, brazenly increases its
prices no less than 50 per cent, ahead of the duty,
and that, too, a duty that it won’t pay at all,
because it doesn’t import treacle, but makes it
locally. If this gigantic imposition is really to be
committed, it isn’t a reason for the abolition of
Protection, but it is good reason for the estab-
lishment of huge Government refineries to ob-
literate the Colonial Sugar Co.’s monopoly. Then
again:—
The worst loss of all was on kerosene, which is in thou-
sands of homes used as an auxiliary fuel, as well as for
light... The small, portable stove is a feature of every
humble kitchen, which is often tlie’only means of cooking
the poorer workwoman allows herself. The kerosene
had been advanced in price from 3s. 6d. per 4-gal. tin
to 4s. 6d., and that shilling meant a blow to even a well-
to-do worker. To the poorer people who buy their kero-
sene by the quart the advance was a penny the quart.
From this it would be imagined that all kerosene
is now under a duty. But kerosene arriving in
bulk or in packages of more than 10 gallons is free.
The Shell Oil Co.—a British concern—imports
the whole of its oil in bulk, and refines it here.
It is good oil, and cheaper than the stuff from
John JD. Rockefeller’s refineries, and is very
largely used already by the Argus’s poor unfor-
tunate working woman. The Shell Co. hasn’t
raised its price, but the Argus wholly ignores
both it and its oil. Presumably the fact that it
employs Australian refinery men, v box-makers,
tin-makers, etc., has made the Argus so mad that
it has cut the Shell Co.’s acquaintance.
Imported Jewellery—Genuine and Otherwise.
Another shocked importer has been up at the
Melbourne Customs Court making remarks. He
was charged with invoicing as 9-carat certain
rings which were found to be wax-filled and
“ shelled ” with gold of 2 J-carat —if such stuff can
be called gold. The presumption was that these
“ brummy” rings were intended to be palmed off on
a confiding public as 9-carat gold articles ; but the
importer swore that he had inspected the things
in the Cold Country, had seen the 9-carat stamp
on them, and had paid for them as such ; in
fact, he had, as shown by his invoices, paid
more for them than for other genuine 9-carat
articles in the same shipment. According to
the Customs Collector, these “brummy” rings
cost the importer from 16s. 6d. to 41s. per dozen,
and he showed others, genuine 9-carat, a trifle
cheaper. The Customs Collector admitted they
had been invoiced too high, considering what
they were ; also there was no complaint that the
genuine ones had been invoiced too low. Now,
the interesting point to the public which buys
retail is this : Genuine 9-carat rings cost this
importer from Is 4|d. to 3s. sd. each. Allowing
for freight, and say, 50 per cent, profit, they were
worth from 2s. 3d. to 6s. each—but where will
you buy a 9-carat ring for 2s. 3d., or even 6s. ?
Unfortunately, the importer could not say who
made these frauds; he bought them from a mer-
chant, and didn’t know whether they were built in
Birmingham or Germany or Kalamazoo (which is
near Chicago), so that about all he can do is to let
the swindles go, and decline to have any further
dealings with the man he bought them from. The
Commerce Act is daily doing Australia a tremen-
dous lot of good, but it can’t do all that is re-
quired. This case shows that, besides the Com-
merce Act, an almost prohibitive duty is
required on jewellery—as well as on many other
articles. Australia produces all the gold and
most of the gems it can use, and if 9-carat
jewellery can be made as cheaply as these invoices
seem to show —they passed the Customs, anyhow
—there is no reason why the importer should reap
about 200 per cent, profit. He might as well -be
forced to turn manufacturer, and pass on at least
100 per cent, of his profits to his workmen. Then
if the goods are made here they .will be made
under our own eye, and the chances of 2J-carat
rubbish being passed off as 9-carat goods will be
lessened. We can reach the Australian who
works that swindle; but an Australian Commerce
Act isn’t long enough in the arm to reach the
foreign fraud who does it.

The Freetraders’ Financial Test.
While newspapers like the Melbourne Argus are
avowing their “acquiescence” in the Protective
policy of the Commonwealth (though each single
and separate duty is made the occasion for a loud
and mournful shriek) they cannot, all the same,
prevent themselves from opening dusty cupboards
and drawing therefrom old and mouldy skeletons,
which rattled their bones in the fiscal arguments
of half a century ago, and are still to be found
exposing their naked pallor in the ’Ome files.
One of these rattly specimens of mildewed oste-
ology came forth to shake its fungus-covered limbs
in the Argus last week. It was this :
A country’s imports are the things it buys.
Its exports are the price it pays for them.
Therefore, when its exports are more than its imports,
it is paying too much for what it gets.
Australian exports are 69 millions sterling, and imports
are 44 millions sterling; therefore (after allowing for
payment of interest and debt redemption) Australia is
being Drained of its M r ealth.
How mad and gibbering a skeleton this is may
be guessed by supposing that things were the
same, only a little more so. Imagine a country
so productive of all sorts of wealth, and so well
protected by tariffs, that its exports were worth
£1,000,000 and its imports were worth Is. 6d.
Then the Freetrade argument would be :
This country buys goods worth Is. 6d.
It pays a million quid for them.
Therefore, it gives away for nothing the sum of
£999,999 18s. 6d. per annum.
Or imagine, again, that things were the other
way round, and that the country EXPORTED
goods worth Is. 6d., and IMPORTED goods
worth £1,000,000. Then behold !
This country buys goods worth £1,000,000.
It pays Is. 6d. for them !!
So other countries are making it a present of
£999,999 18s. 6d. !
In fact, the whole of the Argus theory is so
childish that a boys’ school should see the futility
of it. There is no such rule about exports and
imports as the Foreign-trade paper alleges. A
surplus of exports may mean poverty or wealth.
A surplus of imports may mean poverty or wealth.
All depends on the reason of the surplus. The
excess of imports may signify that a country is
borrowing abroad and that the loans are
arriving in the shape of goods (which means
debt and poverty), or that it has many
millions invested abroad, and that the interest
arrives in the shape of goods (which means
that it is rich). An excess of exports may
mean that the country is frightfully in debt,
and that the excess goes to pay interest (which
is poverty), or that the excess goes to pay
interest and reduce the principal (which is miti-
gated poverty with a prospect of better things
ahead); or the excess of exports Imay mean that
the country is out of debt, that it is rich and self
dependent, and that it is sending surplus wealth
abroad for investment, and is gradually buying up
the earth. The United States exports twice as
much value as it imports because it is rich and out
of debt, and is investing money abroad; Spain does
the same because it is a beggar and in debt, and
in pawn abroad. The world is full of similar
examples, and if the Argus can’t see them, 100
pairs of spectacles would best meet its case. Its
spurious tale, regarded as a reason why we should
open our ports, and let in plenty of imports, and
kill our own industries in order to avoid being
“Drained of our Wealth,” is thinner even than
the story usually told by the person in the dock,
to explain how the pewter half-crown came to be
about his clothes.
The Boarded-Out Infant and His Friends.
The Infant Life Protection Bill, which Chief
Secretary Peacock is about to escort through
Vic. Assembly, may do something to prevent
the awful waste of child life, or it may urge the
parents and foster-parents of the undesirable
infant into new and subtler ways of disposing of
the incubus. A lot depends on the administra-
tion. The Bill provides that boarded-out children
are to be inspected until they are five years old,
instead of till they are two, as at present; that
the inspection is to be done by the Neglected
Children’s Department instead of by the harm-
less, uncouth constable; that, prior to being
boarded out, infants must be medically ex-
amined, and even then the consent of the
department must be obtained to the pro-
ceeding ; that all payments to nurses must be
made through the department, the minimum
being fixed at 10s. and the maximum 40s.
Why Jones Didn’t Leave “Home.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
John Jones, who was an Englishman, informed
his wife that he
Intended emigrating to a land across the sea,
Where the bailiff couldn’t haunt him, and the
workhouse wouldn’t be
The final habitation of his youthful progeny.
So he obtained an atlas, and perused it by the
light
Of a small imported candle as he lay abed at
night;
And his wife, in desperation, held him very, very
tight,
Lest the countries, that he mentioned should
entice him from her sight.
With eager hand he pointed to the Great Aus-
tralian Bight !
“ ’Tis there,” he cried, “that I will go—the land
of pure delight,
Where everyone is happy and the sun is always
bright ! ”
But here he felt that Mrs. Jones was trembling
with affright.
She shuddered at the mention of Victoria and its
farms;
Of New South Wales and Tassy she had vigorous
alarms.
But when he spoke of Queensland, and its verdure
and its charms,
She broke up absolutely, and she fainted in his
arms.
“ O ! Don’t go to Australia, John ! where immi-
grants are drowned
By order of the Government, wherever they are
found,
Where the Labor legislators by a solemn pledge
are bound
To mutilate the stranger who may chance to be
around.”
And then she told him all about the Petriana
Myth,
And showed her husband extracts from a speech
by Mr. Smith.
She told him of the ‘ 1 Hatters ’ ’ and the ‘ ‘ Potters ”
who were flayed,
And the terrible experience of Mrs. Tozer’s
maid.
Then he thought to pacify her by referring to the
fact
That the worker is protected by the Arbitration
Act,
But she simply paralysed him when she answered
with a sob,
“ What’s the use of Arbitration if you haven’t
got a job?”
So Mr. Jones decided, as he scratched his human
dome,
That he wouldn’t leave his missus and go speed-
ing o’er the foam ;
And she was quite contented when he promised
not to roam—
But Australia lost a citizen when Jones
REMAINED AT “HOME.”

Death to Prickly Pear, Lantana, Briars,
Poison Plant, Blackberries, etc.— For successful results
in spraying it is necessary to have a very powerful sprayer
working at about 1001b. pressure; the ordinary hand
pump is useless. An energetic man might be able to
work at 801b. pressure, for a minute or two, but he can-
not keep it up all day long. The Tyree Spray works at
any pressure up to 1501b., and it does the work without
labor. Therefore, in starting out to kill prickly pear or
any other noxious vegetation it is necessary to have an
up-to-date plant to do the work. The rest is easy. It is
not necessary to cut the 1 bushes, as the leaves absorb the
poison. All plants have the power of absorbing chemical
compounds when sprayed on their leaves. This power
varies with the plant and with the chemical. The novice
is very apt to put on too much by using a coarse spray ;
this is fatal to successful results. The Tyree Spray
throws a very fine spray, that enables the mixture to be
built up on the leaves in a similar way to dew at night
time. By having a very fine, fog-like spray the mixture is
blown all over the vegetation, with the result that very
little is lost. With a pump throwing a coarse, rain-like
spray, three-fourths of the mixture falls to the ground,
and not only fails to effect the result but ruins the soil
at the same time. With a Tyree Spray and Tyree
Mixture you can kill any vegetation. For full particulars,

per week ; and that if payments fall four weeks
in arrear the department will take the youngster
from the nurse and do the rearing itself—recover-
ing the cost from the parents much as it does at
present, presumably. Further, the Bill says that
the Governor-in-Council may establish maternity
homes, infant asylums and separate cottage
homes for the care of infants and their mothers ;
also regulations may be made regarding the food of
the infants, their treatment and accommodation.
Barring that “ may,” the Bill seems to go most of
the way that it should go ; anyhow, it should do
a good deal to abolish the shameful slaughter of
much-needed little Australians that has so long
masqueraded under the heading, “Death from
improper feeding.” But a lot of these deaths
have always been intentionally caused, and as to
how the infant impediment will fare now—
whether he will happen casually on the vacant
allotment or transpire unobserved on the banks of
the Yarra or elsewhere—Heaven only knows.
But if this Bill, when passed, doesn’t cause a
sudden lowering of the death rate of Victoria’s
irregular infant, then a State Foundling Hospital
—where all small derelicts will be received and no
questions asked—will have to be established as
the only possible remedy for what has too long
been a scandal to the country.

Wire Netting Troubles.
Joseph Carruthers plays a low game on the
N.S.W. “ primary producer ” these days over the
wire-netting duty. Carruthers prances about
the country like a bad egg, denouncing the 30 per
cent, duty, and rousing the cocky to gusts of hairy
indignation, by explaining how he imported wire-
netting to save the cocky from being devoured by
wild rabbits, and served this Socialistic netting
around on tick ( i.e ., mostly at the country’s
expense), but the Australian Government is now
going to ruin the cocky, etc. And to lend veri-
similitude to Carruthers’ narrative, the N.S.W.
Lands Department is notifying applicants for
Socialistic cheap State netting that owing to the
duty the price has been largely increased. Mean-
time the gulled cocky is cheering the benevolent
Carruthers, and howling at the wicked Com-
monwealth. And it hasn’t struck much of the
cocky yet that, as far as Carruthers is concerned,
there isn’t any 30 per cent. duty. As State
Treasurer, Carruthers is entitled to receive
back three-fourths of the Customs revenue (in
practice he receives back much more than three-
fourths), so that if Carruthers pays the 30 per
cent, duty on State-imported wire netting, at
least 22J per cent, will come back to him— i.e., he
won’t pay in the end more than 7£ per cent., and
will probably only pay 5 per cent. At the very
most the increase in the price of Carruthers’
imported netting should be only per cent.—
and it might easily be a lot less. What the cocky
should get into his head is that when Carruthers
charges him 30 per cent, duty, he is charging 22£
per cent, of that by a mere confidence trick,
devised for the present purpose of vilifying the
Federal Government, and the future purpose of
enabling Joseph to pose as a statesman who
achieved a “surplus” amid overwhelming diffi-
culties. Besides there is another aspect of the
case. Carruthers says solemnly, in various
Sydney papers, that any duty on wire netting
purchased by the State Government is illegal,
because State “property” is free of Federal
taxation, and he says that the action of the Aus-
tralian Parliament is “a horrible state of affairs.”
Now if he believes in his own alleged theory, he is,
of course, going to sprint like blazes to the High
Court, and stop the 30 per cent, duty so far as his
Government’s present and future wire-netting is
concerned. But apparently, despite his loud
talk about the absolute illegality of the Federal
action, he has a dreadful feeling, when it comes
to details, that he hasn’t a leg to stand upon. He
has, seemingly, such a gloomy conviction (in
practice) that his case (about which he is so confi-
dent in theory) hasn’t one durable leg that his
Government doesn’t think it worth while waiting
till the case is tried before it adds the duty to the
price of the netting. It might at least pause till
the matter ha§ been tried, just to keep up an
appearance of faith in its own belief, so to speak.
The Bearers of the Anti-Borrowing Flag.
Although neither of the weak political leaders of
N.S.W.—neither Joseph the Unsatisfactory nor
James the Loser of the ’Bus—has had sense
enough to raise the banner of honesty and
solvency, and to declare against the borrowing
curse, there are not wanting individual candidates
who have more courage. The soured Mother
Gummioge solicitor whose bright young soul was
blighted by Federation, and the stout, terribly-
ordinary boiler-maker who always jogs along in
the dust-cloud just at the tail of the missed
vehicle, may be willing to let things slide for
ever ; but such men as W. E. Vincent, who is
reaching out for the seat at Gough, and Hutton,
who proposes to shake things up for Gregory
Wade at Gordon, and Carmichael, Labor can-
didate at Leichhardt, are keeping the cause of
honesty alive. And there was never a time in all
N.S.W. history when there was more reason to
keep it alive. The great opportunity has come, and
is apparently about to go. Last year, N.S.W. had
a splendid alleged “surplus”—that is to say, it
was able to pay its way, to meet the cost of all its
repairs and patches and of its new public works
out of revenue, and also to reduce the public debt
by an infinitesimal speck. Of course, it only did
this by using about £1,000,000 of land-sale money
as revenue, though land-sale money isn’t really
revenue, but money raised by the sale of assets,
and the distinction is as great as that between
money received as rent for the house and money
obtained by the sale of the house. Still, the per-
formance was a remarkable one for N.S.W., and
the fact that it was the wise policy and the splen-
did economy of the Australian Government which
supplied the means, and that the Australian
Government got the curses while Joseph took the
credit, is only a side issue. Now N.S.W. is at
the parting of the ways. It can go either of two
roads. One alternative is to keep taxation
on the present level, to keep a firm hand
on expenditure, to abolish borrowing (except
for the renewal of old loans) by Act of
Parliament ; to keep the payments into the sink-
ing fund at the present rate, but to make it a
real sinking fund accumulating at compound in-
terest for the extinction of the old debt; and to
make the payment of, say, £1,500,000 a year into
a Public Works Fund a permanent charge on the
revenue. N.S.W. has got into a position, thanks
to Federation, in which it can do these things—
in which it can begin to be honest and to extract
itself out of the bog of debt. AND THAT
POLICY WOULD PAY. It would not only
pay the country as no other policy would, but it
would pay the individual politician. It would
buy votes wholesale. It would appeal to the
people as a great, honest, upstanding policy, and
something quite out of the usual rut. A party
which put honesty and solvency and absolute self-
dependence at the front of its programme, and
preached these doctrines in the voice of Stkntor
or Boanerges would scoop the pool. It would
also fill the bill and gather in the stakes. Then
there is the other alternative—the small, crawly,
retail alternative. This is to go on borrow-
ing, and to dissipate the surplus in a petty
sidelong buying of votes —one here with a
subsidy, one there with a remission of taxes, one
the other place with a reduced railway rate. It
is the sort of method which apparently appeals
greatly to the retail soul of Joseph, the State
Rights Gummidge, and (in a less degree perhaps)
to that of James, the Chronic Loser of the ’Bus;
therefore the first adopts it, and the second doesn’t
vigorously oppose it. Either way there are votes
to be bought; but there are far more votes to
be bought by the first device, and the man who
adopted that device would also get an advertise-
ment that would be heard all over Australia, and.
all over the Empire. His trumpet would be blown
in the ear of all the English-speaking world as the
man who saved his State, and as the first states-
man in the Empire who had the courage to make
public thriftlessness an offence by Act of Parlia-
ment. But it requires courage to strike such an
attitude, and if Joseph and James prefer the
small, humble side-track where there is no fame,
no advt., no trumpet, no saving of the country—
well, perhaps they are the best judges of their
own political dimensions. Anyhow, The Bul-
letin extends a cordial handshake to those war-
riors of the good cause, Hutton of Gordon, and
Vincent of Gough, and Carmichael of Leich-
hardt, and wishes them all success.
How to Abolish, the Betting Market.
“O.K.” writes : The humbug incidental to anti-
gambling legislation was strikingly illustrated in
Melbourne Age of August 6. In one column
appeared a report of the annual meeting of mem-
bers of the Victorian Racing Club, at which the
chairman said :
With regard to the fees charged to bookmakers, it must
be admitted that the sum is a reasonable one, particularly
when it is remembered that betting is now confined en-
tirely to racecourses.
And in thq next column, under the heading of
“ Sporting Notes,” the public was informed :
Attention was given yesterday (at the bookmakers’
clubs, during settling time) to the Caulfield G. N. Steeple-
chase. There was a run on Boomerang, who advanced to
the position of a strong favorite two points in front of
Cardinal, Blueskin, etc., while two points better odds
were offered against The Sun, others in the market at ex-
tended prices being Swimmer, etc., etc.
The statement made by the chairman of the
V.R.C. gets a flat contradiction on the same page
YES-NO.
I hope the supine Freetraders who allowed men like Messrs. Sydney Smith, Lonsdale, Conroy, Lee, and
Hindle to be beaten, will feel now the consequence of their stupid indifference. —G. H. Reid.
THE LAST FREETRADER: “ Strike me pink, George, you assured us fiscalism was dead, and the
only question was Sosh and Anti-Sosh! Is this what you call being dead? ”
of the paper, where it is reported ; nevertheless it
is a truthful statement “within the meaning of
the Act.” Cash betting, except on racecourses,
is forbidden by the Legislature, which also
vetoes publication of the odds on future racing
events. Nor is it clear that any of the wagering
reported was actual cash wagering. The bets are
understood to be booked, like spec, transactions
on the Stock Exchange. The prohibitory Act is
made to look ridiculous in so far as it is frankly un-
reasonable. By authorising the licensing of book-
makers for the convenience of horse-backers on
racecourses only, and by suppressing the publica-
tion of odds calculated to invite the outside public
to bet on future races, the Act fulfils the reason-
able desire of people who discourage the excessive
gambling habit as they discourage-the excessive
drinking habit, but who have no fanatical yearning
to ‘ ‘ put down” the moderate indulgence of either of
them. Where the Act trifles with common sense
is in pretending to ignore the fact that licensed
bookmakers must inevitably transact betting busi-
ness in town, as well as on the racecourses. One
betting club, and only one, in each city should be
lawfully open to bookmakers, registered owners,
and trainers of horses, and any other recognised
persons in the Turf business world, the club
being directed by the same committee which
is empowered to license the “ books ” on
racecourses. It is an absurdity to legalise
betting with the bogus intention of con-
fining it strictly to the racecourse. One lawful
betting club as an adjunct to the lawful open-air
gambling places might be so worked that it would
achieve an almost complete extermination of the
illicit haunts of small gamblers—the silver hells—
where the great bulk of the real gambling evil is
done. Bookmakers, under present conditions,
are supported by horse-owners and heavy backers
even in the States where the totalisator is licensed.
They meet the demand for early investments, by
the “stables,” on future events. They lay the
big bets at long odds which turn out to be good
or bad—mostly bad—according to how the gee-
gee progresses before the day of the race. And
because of these ‘ ‘ stable commission ” considera-
tions many owners are antagonistic to the totali-
sator, seeing that it diverts a lot of punting money
from the coffers of the Moses fraternity. Hence
the need for such an extension of the
totalisator license as would satisfy every-
body now interested in turf gambling—except the
bookmakers. The machine should have a race-
course monopoly of the betting, as far as starters
are concerned. And there should be a machine
for the legalised betting club—a big “all-in”
Tote where any of the hundred or two of entrants
for an important race could be backed as soon as
the weights came out. Arranged on a system of
£5 tickets, with a limit of 400 tickets for each
entrant, the Club tote receipts on a Melbourne
Cup might amount to, say, £30,000 at least, and
the stable that got in early and took a big risk
about its “good thing” might stand to win
£20,000, at fairly long odds, before the racecourse
totes for starters only were opened to speculation.
By legalising this exclusive receptacle for early
investments, the Government could strike a death
blow' at the bookmaking fraternity, and put an
end to the betting market. The odds that the
tote lays are an unknown quantity until the
accounts are closed. The machine is a silent
bookmaker that doesn’t regulate its prices, or
create false favorites, or bribe jockeys, or practise
chicanery in any form. Yet we have a mob of
noisy rogues licensed to bet in the two largest
States of the Commonwealth, whilst the totalisator,
controlled with due regard for the limitation of
the Gambling Evil, is sternly forbidden by hypo-
critical Governments, in the alleged interests of
public morality.

Faked invoices seem to be part of the importer’s
stock-in-trade. It is the S. M. Herald’s turn
now. Last week, under four flaring headings, it
threw a curse at the new tariff, and announced
that housekeepers hadn’t realised the horror of it,
“ but the following series of invoices should open
their eyes.” And then it proceeded to fake five
invoices without a blush —and faked them so
badly that it made “syds. of flannel at 1/6” work
out at 8/9, “ two pairs of socks at 1/- ” come to 2/4
and “ 281 b. mixed paints at 4d. per lb.” arrive at
12/-. The Herald isn’t honest enough to say that
it is printing purely fictitious invoices; in fact,
over one of its fakes it is dishonest enough to
print—“ Those about to furnish will do well to
look at the following invoice from another firm.”
It would be interesting to know what dead-and-
gone John Fairfax, who did leave some
traditions of honesty behind him, would think of
that sore of political campaigning. He, honest
old soul, hadn’t been trained up to the modern
Tory idea that a man can play the three-card and
confidence tricks in matters of politics and still be
a gentleman.
S.M. Herald is very sanguine about the result
of a very small experiment. It says :
The decision of the Commonwealth Government to
arrange for the military training of rifle-club members
will probably affect about 30,000 men.
Which is the idea of the local Rifle Ass., as put
through its secretary, whom the Herald had
interviewed. The old lady then proceeds to
expound on her own account: —
The idea is to build up mobile forces. It is not in-
tended to put riflemen through any ceremonial drill, but
to inculcate military efficiency. Thus, as population
increased, if rifle clubs multiplied in proportion, the
Commonwealth would have, in addition to its regular
troops and militia, a reserve army in the making.
Just what will make these troops “mobile” is
not stated, nor is the thing specified that is going
to deal them out “military efficiency.” So far
as numbers go, there are about 18,000 rifle-club
members in Victoria, 11,000 in N. S, Wales, and
12,000 in all the other States. That tots up to
41,000 in all. Granny is sanguine enough to
believe (in print) that 75 per cent, of that total
can be relied on to go to drill. The Common-
wealth only expects 1500, and will probably not
get that number. And anyhow the idea of the
“ mobile forces” is simply a joke. If anyone of
the clubs, with an average of 55 members in
N. S. Wales, or 60 in Victoria, were required
after 10 years’ inculcation of military efficiency
(whatever that may be) to make itself suddenly
“movable,” and take the field, it couldn’t do it.
It couldn’t feed itself, supply itself with cart-
ridges, or arrange for the care of those of its
members who got hurt, or fell ill on the march.
A scheme for inculcating military efficiency
which doesn’t even attempt ‘ ‘ ceremonial drill, ” and
which will rope in but a score or so of belated
individuals here and there, is so negligible as
hardly" to be worth mention.

In these delightful days of early spring
even G. L. Goodman, who sits alongside the
Sydney end of J. C. Williamson’s cash-box, and
looks as though he has weathered ten thousand
storms of applause—even he feels the sap stirring
at his heart, and breaks forth into poetry. It
isn’t much poetry, it is true, but it starts suddenly
and gets there quickly—
Andrew Mack
Is coming back,
and if you put plenty of white before and behind,
it fills up a two-inch advt. The Blarney is,
however, not back yet; it has still the
best part of a fortnight to go in Melbourne.
There was time, therefore, for another help-
ing of hash, so “The Belle of New York ” was
put on the plate at Her Majesty’s. “ The Belle ”
has been a hard-worked item in J.C.W.’s property
list; Rose Musgrove played in the name-part only
the other day, it seems. Yet the daring eccen-
tricities of the quaint foolishness are a perpetual
delight, and Fred Leslie’s nimble footwork as
Blinky Bill, the lightweight, is a joy for ever. It
gives Lauri a rest, too. He has, certainly, been
the reformer from Cohoes before to-day, but the
singing part is too heavy for him; and Alf
Stephens has been brought over to the co. to
intone the moral precepts of Ichabod Bronson.
Stephens gives a good, sound performance on the
old lines. Just as Blinky Bill might have been
built for Leslie, the Polite Lunatic might have
been designed for W. S. Percy ; to an amusing
picture he adds a touch of feeling when,
apropos of nothing, he calls for a ton of
coals and makes a final exit. It is a fine
little piece of business that. Miss Florence
Young, upon whom the honors of this season have
fallen every time, has here a part that doesn’t suit
her. Miss Young can be many sorts of girl;
but not the demure sort that the Salvation Army
lassie is supposed to be, and she drops all effort to
suggest demureness in the second act, and lives
right up to her change of clothes. Miss Alma
Barber is a dainty Fifi, who puts brains into the
part, but not much warmth into her love-making;
Reginald Roberts is but moderately effective as
Bronson’s boy ; and the rest are not remembered,
while the chorus isn’t as good as usual.

At the Palace, Miss Baines is still forming
herself into a limited liability co., and giving away
shares in property that doesn’t belong to Merely
Mary Ellen at all, but to the other girl mas-
querading in the kitchen. The public likes
“ Miss Lancashire, Limited,” and the accent of
the Lancashire farm hand is spreading, and her
laughing songs and ballads are finding a paying
echo.

“ Hoppy ” bounds and blusters nightly to
good houses at Sydney Criterion, and no change
of bill is yet suggested. Two members of the
Hopkinson Co. committed matrimony last week ;
yet the play doesn’t argue much in favor of matri-
mony. The people who are in the blessed state
don’t seem happy, and the people who are not in
it don’t seem to expect to be happy when they get
in. Yet the players go and get married. Thus
does a great immoral lesson fail in its purpose.

“ A Great Awakening,” in which mostly a
man awoke to find a beautiful fiend in a blazing
red dress hammering him with the fire-irons, went
finally to sleep on Tuesday night. On Wednesday
“A Warning to Women” was to have been
staged at Sydney Royal, but at that time The
Bulletin was struggling through the press, and
it knows not this week what is the character of
the warning. Most likely it is a lurid one and
wears a large hat with a dissipated feather in it.

The Tivoli bill is the best mixture that
house has had for months. The newcomers in-
clude the Geraldos, four people who do a sur-
prising juggling act with hoops and clubs, and
make a picture out of it. Fred. Graham and
Miss Dent continue their little comedy; the
Svengalis get near the end of their season, which
hasn’t come up to the glory of their posters; and
Lex McLean and Gus Rennert, the wrestler, are
arguing as to which can lift most dead-weight.
They have agreed to settle the matter on Friday
night. There doesn’t seem to be promising ele-
ments about a performance which consists of two
men lumping pieces of iron ; but the top part of
the Tivoli has got quite excited about it.

“ Human Hearts,” a drama that has lately
been ravaging Maoriland under the direction of
remorseless Geach, arrived at Melb. Princess’s
on Saturday. In its manner of endeavoring to
make an audience laugh, weep and shudder, this
quaint production is wholly American. The
most prevalent character is a Tattered Tramp,
who drops into the proceedings as though he had
escaped from a Rickards co. to relieve the gloom.
And there is a prison scene which seems to have
been adapted from “The Man from Mexico,” and
where the Tramp asserts his usefulness by bring-
ing a free pardon for the village blacksmith who
had been duly convicted of parricide. By way of
apology for its impossible happenings, the drama
offers the public sundry conventional inducements
to weep. It has a blind old mother, a faithful old
negro (cast in the mould of Uncle Tom), a,
crippled bov, a semi-idiot brother, a nice girl
who quotes Scripture, and the inevitable cheeild.
All of these characters contribute words and
deeds which are accepted as “ affecting ” by many
people, especially the amphitheatre matron who
has brought up a family of eleven, without count-
ing the three she lost. Two other characters,
exclusive of the heroic blacksmith, are his
wife and her awful paramour, but the two
guilty people are destitute of human heartage,
and they come to grief in the last act. When
the male villain has foully murdered the Huy m
the presence of witnesses he is led awjy by the
police, leaving the witnesses to perform a touching

The amazing Bent tells his Brighton con-
stituents of his travels (Age, 16/8/’07)
I went across the Indian Ocean—an awful trip—
(laughter)—and got to Ceylon. Some of you know
Ceylon ; some of you have seen the almost nude niggers—
(laughter)—when they go down for sixpences. A great
sight it is, especially for the ladies. (More laughter and
smiles from Mr. Bent.) Then I landed in Ceylon, “ where
every prospect pleases, and only man is vile.” (Laugh-
ter.) There are lots of fat niggers, fatter than I ani, and
you should see them tempting the ladies—(great laugh-
ter)—to buy all sorts of things. They began by asking
for 200 rupees, and ended by taking 10. They offered
me cats’ - eyes for 30 rupees, but at the
finish I got them for four. (Applause and laughter.)
There was a terrible dust storm, and it was hot. I had
a bad time ; we all did, and the unfortunate ladies
thought they were going to die. Then we got to Port
Said, that dirty place. (Laughter.) It is a dirty place.
(More laughter.) As one passes through there he is liable
to take up a disease, and I told Lord Cromer what sort of
a place I thought it was. Well, I was very anxious while
I was there to find out where Moses crossed over the Ked
Sea. (Laughter.) I was shown one place by some
people, and other places by others. I asked our
Governor (Sir Reginald Talbot), who was travelling
with us, if he could tell me. The reason I asked hjm was
that he had lived in Cairo for a number of years.
(Laughter.) But none of them could agree—even the
ministers of religion did not seem to know for certain—
and I can’t tell you yet within a few feet the spot where
Moses did cross. If England wants its Empire it should
look after Port Said, and see that health is one of the
things it has in its Empire. (Cheers.) Then we saw what
some people call Mount Vesuvius, but I have another name
for it. (Laughter.) It was in active eruption when I passed
by—very active eruption. (Laughter.) Some of the ladies
begged the captain to steer a different course, but he said
he thought we would get through all right—(laughter)—
and we did. I went ashore at Marseilles and was taken
to Notre Dame, a big place stuck up on a hill. It is the
place the sailors used to go to and pray for a safe voy-
age before they started out; very often the voyage
proved safe, too. There is a lot of lime and cement dug
at Marseilles. Etc., etc.

The least convincing member of a very
competent company is Miss Sidney, vvho imper-
sonates the blacksmith’s wife. Previous to her
lying dead, the actress is somewhat angular and
decidedly tame. Ernest Leicester, the “star”
performer, has a commanding figure, good voice,
and easy style of filling the bill. The tramp is
humorously played by 0. M. Berkeley, a versatile
comedian; and the minor character of the nice,
pious girl is charmingly presented by Miss Guild-
ford Quin, who wears the right facial expression
for the part, and speaks it to perfection. “ ’Unian

At Her Majesty’s (Melbourne) the weakest
■of Andrew Mack’s pieces, which is “ Jack
Shannon,” was put on last Saturday, and will be
put off on Friday. In “Mack Shannon,” the
decorative leading man is rather less decorative
than usual; also he is handicapped with a heavy
father, who suspects him of robbing a safe, and
the principal business of his heroism is to persuade
his uninteresting parent that he was wrongfully
suspected. As usual, the unalterable Mack
nurses a child, and bursts into.song, and frequently
rouses the house to enthusiasm with a remark
which ends in “ begorra.” This Saturday brings
a revival of “ Tom Moore,” the variegated drama
that sets forth Mack’s valuable stock-in-trade to
the best advantage. One night of “Arrab-na-
Pogue ” ends the season on the 29th.

“The Bondman,” in its third week at
Melbourne Royal, continues to be marred by a
false ending. Jason, who is rather anxious to be
shot and buried, and has made himself comfort-
ably drunk in anticipation of his doom, is saved
from execution by an obnoxious old grandfather,
whom he reluctantly recognises as such. This
appears to be Bland Holt’s own original notion
of a happy finish—the reconciliation of an
unwilling grandson with a hoary tyrant. Instead
of a martyr’s crown the interrupted Jason will
presently gain his relative’s earthly possessions,
and fall a bloated victim to his taste for liquor.
The future of Jason is a sad subject for conjec-
ture. He had stated, ere grandpa spoilt the
climax, that his execution was desirable because
it would prevent him from dying in a ditch. He
didn’t wish to goon fighting the hard black bottle
of life. In his reprieved state he seems pretty
certain to pass disgracefully away on a spring
mattress, with ten doctors in attendance, which is
the least artistic decease a confirmed inebriate
can arrive at.

The first, of Coward’s Picture Concerts
eventuated at Melbourne Town Hall on Saturday
evening. That temple of the winds was filled by
folk who showed their approval of the rational
tariff—it varies from a meagre saxpence to a
cheap little florin—by turning up early, and
applauding hard. The West Biograph spoils one’s
appreciation for the samples that are hired out to
occasional entertainments. Therefore the sight-
destroying sections of the Coward “Pop’’only
elicit an adjective of condemnation. The prin-
cipal feature was the first appearance of the Har-
monists—four males who mixed their voices
melodiously enough in some charming old compo-
sitions and a couple of humorously-intentioned
new ones. Mr. Coward, who is an alto,
sang some familiar ballads, into which he intro-
duced certain trumpet-like falsetto notes. He is
perfectly trained, but, somehow, when a stalwart
six-footer, with long grey hair, chortles in the
tones of a choir-boy, the effect is—oh, well, never
mind ! Mr. Avalon Collard made polite jokes,
and sang one or two ditties. Miss Warman,
a pig-taded damsel, billed as “The Brilliant
Soprano,” carolled a waltz-song or so in a capti-
t a ting healthy mezzo voice. Altogether the show,
barring the biograph nuisance, was well worth
whatever coin one paid-up to a florin.

The bill at the Opera House has not been
refreshed by a novelty since Edward Cranston
and co. became responsible for an Irish Racing
Sketch of surpassing foolishness. Last week’s
reference to this pretentious trifle omitted to
mention that Carden Wilson is the redeeming
feature of the co. Earlier in the evening Wilson
gives his clever impersonations of people he has
met, and if he were to introduce a second series
into the racing sketch, whilst Cranston made
himself scarce, the Rickards’ entertainment
would be strengthened in its weakest link.
Happily some new “turns” will occur on
Saturday.

Adelaide has roused up suddenly in the
way of amusements. The Holloway Co. has
moved out of the Royal with the corpse-in-the-
eellar dramas on which it squanders so much
good acting, and has made way for Leslie Harris
and “ Living Paris,” which jingling combination
of music and pictures makes a respectable pro-
gramme. The Tivoli has been starring the quaintly
talkative Carlton, and at the Town Hall the
rather time-worn Albani is succeeded by the
vigorous and up-to-date “Besses” Band. The Lan-
cashire men were much impressed at getting a
formal “reception” on arrival from Governor,
Mayor, and Premier (Tom Price says that he is a
Welshman by birth, but a good Liverpool man
by early training). The centre of general attrac-
tion, however, is the Exhibition, where the
Women’s Work show has just started on a reckless
10 days’ splash, with rifle-shooting, needlework,
hockey, photography, and other feminine occu-
pations as side-shows.

AT POVERTY POINT.
The Bulletin is asked to state that the musical “ All
Blacks ” are touring S. Australia. It really doesn’t know
the All Blacks from crows ; but, as they have advertised
in this paper, they are evidently aborigines of discern-
ment, and Brother Bills who know where to get good
value for six shillings. Therefore, on general principles,
The Bulletin hopes that at Yudnamutana the orchestra
will have to sit on the roof so as to give more accommoda-
tion to the crowding youth and beauty of the place, and
that the “ Blacks” will be able to wind up their season at
Tantanoola without having to play “ Uncle Tom’s Cabin ”
to an audience of one tiger.
“0.K.”: With all my heart I say “ ditto ” to “ Billy T.’
when he denounces the stage Irishman as the most
palpably fraudulent of love-makers. To me it seems that
the “purty ” speeches, in which the nauseating treacle is
laid on with a trowel, should be not less unacceptable to
a woman than Paddy Blarney’s self-confident manner of
uttering them. Of the art which conceals art there is
not a suggestion in the posing, sighing, speech-making
Patrick. The brazen insincerity of the blarney-monger
reflects contempt for the intelligence of any girl who
could delight to listen to him. This, from a non-irish-
man’s point of view. But I have been told by an ex-
ceptionally clever and wideawake girl (of Irish parentage)
that “Andrew Mack makes love beautifully,” or “like
an angel,” and so I am confirmed in my old opinion that
women—for all their claim to refinement of taste—are
essentially “ bad form ” in their emotional temperament
from a man’s point of view. Their critical faculty is but
little developed where flattery of themselves is concerned,
and although they laugh at the gullible man whose vanity
they feed, the bigger laugh is on his side every time. A
little compliment goes a long way with the average man.
A big dose of flattery, such as women crave for and
swallow greedily, would sicken him. So the woman’s
instinct warns her to be cautious in helping him to
treacle. Moreover, her love-making impresses him be-
cause it comes natural to her. She is the born
actress. But the average man is not an easy
artist in pretence. His acting is not nearly so
, subtle as hers. Looking back at one’s own little
successes in love-making one remembers that they
were marked by the thinnest and most hackneyed o'f
histrionic effects. The girl was satisfied with nothing
less than wild exaggeration. No expression of
the yearning spirit—in the rapt gaze, the tender utter-
ance, the eager embrace—could be too florid for her
liking. She wanted melodramatic ardor. A man who
has never tried to make love theatrically (because he isn’t
built that way) may think himself quite satisfactory,
seeing that an occasional girl accepts him, under silent
protest, as the only sweetheart that offers. But a
histrionic wooer, who affects an air of sincerity, can
always cut out the matter-of-fact fellow. And may be
the most successful Lothario of all is the one who plays
down to the mere blarney level of the stage Irishman.
The widow of Dan Leno (“ the only genius the British
music-hall stage has yet produced ”) remarried last
month. In the early ’eighties, the lady, then Miss Lydia
Reynolds, was well known as a ballad singer. Her choice
is a very youthful alleged comedian named Best, which
(vide the Jersey Lily, Ellen Terry, etc.) affords yet
another instance of the ex-stage lady’s passion for picking
up things young and callow in the male line.
Walter Baker, for many years the hero in Bland Holt’s
companies, has reached London. Walter is a Sydney
native and son of an old political agent, Edward Sadler,
well known in electioneering matters a generation ago—
what time James Martin and Henry Parkes wrangled
in Parliament. Ted Sadler was a cordwainer, who
had served his apprenticeship at Miller’s Point, when the
“Black Dog ” (afterwards “ The Ocean Wave,” and now
known by another “ Shellback ” name) was the head-
quarters of the “Rocks” electioneering push. There
was another political shoemaker in the neighborhood—
Hussey, of Cribbs Lane.
Highly condensed dramatic criticism by “ Sydolt ”
A dramatic club recital occurred at Glen’s last Tuesday.
One Arthur Clarke was responsible. The Comet still
shines. Friends, relations, and other fiends stamped the
affair a success—financially. Genius skulked—fled on the
first bar of the overture. Then once again was W. Shak-
speare maltreated for the pleasure of the mob. Avenging
spirits stalked down the aisle, but the aspirants voiced on
to the end. The bright star of the evening was kiddy
Donald Cameron—he of the ginger mop in Mack’s “ Tom
Moore ” Co. This youngster respected the Bard of Avon,
but he tackled Browning! “An Incident of the French
Camp” was a big task, but the little fellow possessed
dignity. Can the Comet spare a tail ? One
damsel “ did ” Lady Macbeth. They should have
stopped her, for Tragedy has its limits. “Denver’s
Dream” was attacked by a good-voiced youth whose
effeminacy of action and coiffure made you hysterical.
It’s wicked to watch an elocutionist of some ability
tenderly sweeping the uncut locks from his eyebrows
while he cries, “No shelter, no escape—ah, no hope. Oh
God ! Oh Gawd 1 ” A lisping Lady Teazle was also there.
A rather versatile Jewish youth played Shylock in the
Trial Scene. Result: a pawnbroker’s grumble. One sweet-
faced performer, in trying to get the best results, had
cultivated a South of France accent with a dash of
Tittell Brune in it. Have you noticed how the female
amateurs imitate Matilda? Anyway, the South of France
lady wasn’t too awful. She meant all she said, and knew
what she was talking about. It was only the way she did
it. She got through with a shove. Others were encour-
aged with the same shove,-but fell outside the gate, and
were pushed through. Shoving was allowed, but push-
ing meant Death. Others recited with mediocre results.
Managing such a Club spells Cash. Girleen recites, and
her friends flock to hear her out of sheer spite. That
means buying a ticket, but a sly, isolated giggle at
another’s expense is cheap at the price of a ticket.
“Blue Peter”: “Theßondman”costumesarebeautifully
vague. The programme fixes the date as 1850. In the Isle
of Man, Maggie Knight wears an Elizabethan dress, and
Frances Ross an indefinite peasant costume. Charlie
Brown has a modern brown suit; Maxwell, the latest thing
in flannel suits, with one of the new kind of collars ; and
George Rignold, a brigand get-up, trimmed with a blood-
stained handkerchief and a long knife. George is fond
of large slouchy hats and brigand outfits, as witness his
huge base bass conspirator in “ Called Back.” In Sicily,
Maxwell dresses like David Copperfield, and Frances
Ross’s hat and other fixings are the newest things for the
coming summer. Bland seems to have let them pick any
old century they liked. I wondered if some buxom
walking lady would wear blue fleshings and rabbit-skins,
Ancient Briton style, but no one did, worse luck.
London Sporting Times in a recent issue chuckled un-
kindly over the coming discomfiture of a personal friend
of its staff, who wrote to it from Maoriland that he had
heard the Besses o’ th’ Barn were due there. He
meant, he said, to be early on the wharf to meet them,
“ to get the pick of the muslin before the other bounders
chip in.” There is something almost pathetic about Percy
Adolphus with his supper-proposals in his hand, bringing
up with a shock against a crowd of stalwart Lancashire
male ruffians.
“ S.” : Miss Ada Ward says Australia is cold and dead
to religion. “ God is not wanted here,” she said in Mel-
bourne, “ and I am leaving on Tuesday.” There is an irre-
verentinferenceinthis, that the melo-evangelist is taking
the Almighty with her. It is the egotism of all evangelists ;
they cannot help identifying their little side shows with
the Creator, and consequently the person who refuses to
flop at their bidding is a scorner of Providence. The
notion is quite common amongst clergymen. For in-
stance, I know of one plump parson (something of a
notoriety in his way) who, on being made the subject of
several caricatures in a weekly paper, tore the journal up
in a burst of righteous indignation, exclaiming : “ These
people have no respect for God ! ”
Florence “Ballara” returns to Europe by the P.
and O. steamer Moldavia. She will visit Germany
before again seeking a foothold in London. Miss
“Ballara” no longer hopes to take the world by
storm ; she will be thankful if she can take a bit of it.
The Ballarat lady is nicer than her voice, which did not
impress Australia very favorably. Also, she is nicer than
her stage name; people always think of her as “Miss
Bally. ”
“S.”; Ernest Leicester, of Edwin Geach’s “Human
Hearts ” company, doesn’t look an ancient, but he cannot
be so much of a chicken as to induce the curious to search
for fragments of the shell still clinging to his exterior.
Describing his long, honorable record to an Argus inter-
viewer, the other day, he went into figures. His longest
engagement, if I remember aright, was for 15 years ; his
shortest, if my memory isn’t obscured by drink, seems
to have been for five ; and apparently there were 20 of
them, unless tobacco and late hours, and a long
course of sordid dissipation, combined with un-
punctuality and cruelty to animals, have im-
paired my powers of calculation. Putting this
and that together, it would appear that as a boy
Ernest played with Methuselah, but has outlived his dis-
tinguished contemporary. In the same interview Mr. Lei-
cester felt called upon to enthuse over the melodrama, its
sweetness and light, and its freedom from those pernicious
problems which we findin the noxiousplays of a Pinero. The
average melo-mummer cannot praise the dreadful Sutton
Vane without declaring Pinero to be mere mud, just as
the candle-maker cannot advertise his tallow dip with-
out casting aspersions on the sun. But is the
melodrama the clean, wholesome thing it is alleged to
be ? On the contrary, is it not straining in a crude, bald,
vulgar way to raise beans from precisely the same dirt
that Pinero is cultivating artistically, craftily, and with
brains? The stupid people who rush to see “The Most
Horrible Female in Greece ” and revel in it, do not hesi-
tate to rebuke Ibsen, Sudermann and Pinero for their lack
of respect for the domestic virtues. And in doing so they
mistake inferior intellect for superior morality.
The age of the famous Hungarian violinist, Joseph
Joachim, just deceased, is generally given as 76, but if
some green-eyed fellow-professionals of his earlier days,
are to be believed he was at least three years older. He
started as an infant wonder. As a seven-year old, whose
embittered rivals said he was 10, he fiddled with great
success at Pesth ; and at 13, when infuriated competitors
said he was at least 16, “ the celebrated Hungarian boy,
Master Joachim,” was one of the instrumental attractions
of London’s Drury Lane Theatre. But however young or
elderlyjhe might have been when dragged from the nur-
sery, Jdachim put up in his longlife a solid musical record
that fmfpng whatever to do with the size he took in
years.^f'pi
ThEit weird melodrama, “ The Face at the Window,”

When the Anderson co. toured Maoriland some time back
and opened to big Maori business with
the r ace. But when the countenance appeared at the
casement, and opened itself, and emptied out its fear-
some wail, the great mass of Maori superstition stood up
with hair on end, and fled for the exits. It was just a
wild, tumbling breakaway, as if the Old Chap himself was
in hot pursuit. Next morning a burly Maori personage
presented himself at the office, as one who walks timidly
upon eggs, and inquired if there was to be “any more
face to-night.” On being informed that another drama
would be staged, he replied “ Eight oh, boss.”
'* M.P.A.” ; Bert Bailey and Ned Duggan’s Horstralian
bellodrama, “ The Squatter’s Daughter,” is not to go un-
challenged as original work. For instance, Dan Barry
declares he played it years and years ago, and E. I. Cole,
of the Sydney and Melbourne ’lppodromes, says it’s a
re-hash of his “Coo-ee,” which the Owe’Sullivan wrote.
Cole, of course, could easily lay claim to anything, as
the nightly occurrence at the ’lppo has a flavoring of
the “Blue Moon,” the “ Bondman,” and Czerny, all
produced under violent peanut and lemonade conditions.
' Dux, from New Plymouth (M.L.): —Musgrove’s long
string of German sausages arrived here yesterday. Con-
trary to expectations, they played “Lohengrin” last
evening, as advertised. The audience was requested to
be there not later than 7.40 p.m., and the cow was con-
siderably hurried, so that its owner might be up to time.
After a wearisome wait, the rag went up at B.2o—only
40min. late. Three intervals of 20min. apiece damped the
enthusiasm of even the soulful ones, and when I left at a
quarter past midnight the show was still dragging along.
These Teutons have no consideration for the cow-man.
Several who saw the thing to the bitter end were sacked
for being late for “ bail-up ” this morning. In the early
hours of the morning, according to report, 15 of the co.
sat down to a supper of ham and eggs, bread and cheese,
corned beef, etc., and claret. A squabble arose over
something, and 13 of their number took the huff and
turned into bed supperless. The remaining two are said
to have scoffed everything in sight, barring- the plates
and the good hard table. It was a great feast.
Gertie’s first business experience was in wrestling with
onions at the pickle foundry. She was tender-hearted on
her father’s side, and wept over her work. She was one
of a vulgar crowd who went to and from their job with
their crowning glory tied up in rags. They said smart
things to respectable people who dared to look. Gertie’s
boots were of the heelless variety, and her costume was
not a la mode. In the evenings she frizzed her front hair,
put in the pads, and donned the war-paint. Gertie sang
coon melodies in a nasal tone at the Poseidon Select
Assembly (gents Is., ladies free). After that she
shook her limbs in an imitation of a dance.
The boys said she was a dead ring for Grade
Grahame. Pretty soon she took a prize in the East Col-
lingwood Competition. From that out her fate was
sealed. When the enterprising manager inserted a
shilling squib for “ Girls, smart, able dance,” Gertie ap-
plied at the stage door, and qualified with honors. She
ieft her responsible job without giving notice, and
thereby busted herself in commercial circles. The first
week she developed peroxide hair and a maiden’s blush
complexion. After a time she was promoted to the front
row, because she could kick higher than the manager’s
head and knock his hat into next week with her toe. She
afterwards became one of the special four, called “The
Wiry Girls,” in the big production. She displayed
more limb than all the rest of the show put to-
gether. The gilded youth reserved front stalls by the
row, Gertie high-kicked herself into favor, and went for
motor rides with the male division of the Upper. Ten.
She was considered just the thing, and carefully avoided
making grammatical errors. The time came when she
married a wealthy Anti-Socialist, and presided over a
regiment of menials. Sometimes she passes the pickle
emporium in her 16-h.p. motor, with the latest thing in
“ chuffers.” She always looks the other way when she
passes the pickle factory.
“Araemo” (from Melbourne): About the only shark
whom The Bulletin has so far failed to drop on with
both feet is the gentleman who runs the cheap suburban
variety-show. His company consists of a couple of “ has-
been ” comic singers, and seven or eight casuals. These
latter are generally attracted by an advertisement
announcing that a job as balladist, serio, or juvenile
song-and-dance artist, is going begging. In the case of
the juveniles, many A.N.A. “ champions” apply, and go
through a private performance in the presence of the
manager. He chooses a few of the best, and promises to
let them know when he requires them. When that
joyful time arrives, the budding “ star ” is usually pro-
vided with a new costume for the occasion by its proud
parents. These same roll up with all their other kids,
and also their friends, and pay for admittance to the
show. The engagement lasts for one night, and the
youngster gets 2s. 6d., or sometimes even as much as
ss. This is more than balanced by the admission-
money paid by parents and friends. The serio and
balladist are very often caught in the same way,
though not in such numbers. Some of them sing a
couple of songs in each part of the programme for. the
magnificent sum of ss. or 7s. 6d. An even worse shark is
the one who runs competitions—vocal and dancing—for
children. The prize in each division is generally a silver
medal, which costs about 4s. 6d.; the admission to the
show is 6d. The “management” is careful not to let
the competitors know for certain on what night they will
have to do their turns ; therefore they and their friends
have often to attend several times. There are several
preliminary contests, and then the finals. Thus, even
the winners only get an allegedly-silver medal for several
performances ; the others get nothing. The audience is
allowed to judge, so, of course, each kid persuades as
many friends as possible to attend. Why not pass a law
allowing the police to shoot all competition-promoters
on sight ? Or gazette them as thistles?
THE CURTAIN PALLS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Where is the tree
The lovers discovered
Where the bird sang
And the bee hovered ?
Fallen the leaves*
The tall trunk is sundered
Of old, through the limbs,
A lonely moon wondered.
More than the tree
Is dust and departed,
Gone on the wind
That sighs heavy-hearted.
Gone is the bird
Whose song was a measure
That made all the leaves
To tremble with pleasure.
Gone is the bee—
The rover brown-coated—
Who fed on the sweets
Of blossoms red-throated.
Hearken, OWind,.
Sighing scent-laden,
Gone is the youth,
And gone is the maiden.

“K” : lam deadly tired of the superior
English person who conies out here and makes
remarks about the local twang. What about the
Cockney twang ? And the Cum-
berland dialect, which is scarcely
understandable ? And the York-
shire, which is not understand-
able at all ? And the Devonshire,
which is fearsome? And the
“ Zomerzet” ? And the Midland,
in which “ I will ” is “Oy
000000 l ” ? And the aspirate
trouble, which makes the Eng-
lishman say “ Hit hain’t the
’untin’ as ’urts a ’orse but the
’ammer, ’ammer, ’ammer of
the ’orse’s ’oofs on the ’ard
’igh road ” ? And the strange
inversion of verbs which makes
the belated Baptist choir-
singer demand, “ Did nobody '
never see nothin’ o’ never a
’ymn book nowhere ” ? I teach
the young idea, and I know
whereof I speak. Last batch
of immigrants gave me three
new pupils—one from Cumber-
land, a Yorkshire boy, and a
Cockney. Two I couldn’t under-
stand at all, the third made me
writhe every time he spoke. I, a
Maorilander, presumably more
or less afflicted with a twang,
have to teach these English
youngsters to speak English. The
Cockney I despair of ; the others
are beginning to speak almost in-
telligibly, after six months’ strug-
gle. But some of their barbari-
ties beat me still. Young Cum-
berland always pronounces eight
“ite,”. and when he says his
“ite times tairble” it is a treat.
One of our English educational
importations happened along, the
other day, in time to hear him
affirm that “ite elevens are ity-
ite.” Visitor murmured some-
thing about “colonial twang.” Then I
jumped at my ohance and explained at
length, with scorn for the barbarous
English dialects. And that Englishman
didn’t say a word.
About the record brilliant excuse to date
was that lately proffered by a Melbourne police
courtier, who was asked to account for his posses-
sion of a lovely black eye. “If you please, sir-r”
—hehesitated—“I trod on it.” Even a police
court didn’t have the heart to fine that man the
customary 10s.
The pathos ttf life iii the asylum for the
destitute \Vas never really brought home to The
Bulletin uiltil it received a letter of complaint
from an iriniateof the Parramatta (N.S.W.) insti-
tution. A brief extract
The other two meals are a slice of bread, no butter, not
even for the sightless men. . . . Two fowls that were
cooked weekly for the dying- are discontinued.
In earlier days, presumably, the blind man got
butter on his bread, and the dying man was
reminded once a week by a portion of fowl that
the grave was yawning for him—just as the man
condemned to be hanged can have anything he
likes for breakfast the morning of the execution,
so long as he doesn’t ask for a bit of some animal
that roams the African forest, so that the procur-
ing of it would delay the hanging. It is hard to
say which was more grimly cruel—the invidious
indulgence or its abolition. Cannot the State do
a little better than this for its old citizens ? If
the bit of fowl, being practically a death-warrant,
did more harm than good, why not establish a
sort of an alibi , and obscure the issue, and avoid
any harrowing differentiation, by giving occa-
sional fowl all round? Then the dying man
would get his chookey hen without seeing his
burial certificate tied to its leg.

Melbourne City Councillors, having been
decorated with small metal plates in order that
their unimportance may be discernible at a
glance, a movement is afoot in Victoria to provide
medals for Justices of the Peace. The proposed
bauble is to have ” J.P.” in bold letters on one
face, and the name and date of the owner on the
other. The Bulletin sees no objection. When
this country reaches the stage where knights,
J’s.P., dogs and aboriginal kings all wear their
metal plate, and the adulterator has a bill with
the record of his conviction pasted up outside his
shop, and the pious gentleman who draws rent
from the house of ill-fame is compelled to have
his own domicile painted bright red for a whole
year after the discovery of his iniquity, things
will begin to look up.

South Australia is only a very occasional
co-respondent—for years past it hasn’t averaged
more than about five and a half divorces a year,
while N. S. Wales can easily manage 300 ; and
when it does get a divorce case S. Australia acts
as though it were ashamed of being found out,
and hides the proceedings away in the middle of
the law reports, so that nobody but hardened
lawyers will be likely to find them. Consequently,
by reason of this lack of practice, the Adelaide
co-re. hasn’t the least idea of what is required of
him. The other day there were three of him in one
case, and all put in an appearance, because they
were told to by a piece of paper that never ex-
pected they would. When the first started
to go into details, the Judge stopped him and
told him that he really needn’t if he thought he
was giving himself away. But all he did was to
dive a bit deeper into the lady’s past and his own.
Then the second co-re. stepped up when his name
was called, and while the Court handed him “ th’
Book,” the Judgedecided to take time by the front
hair, and he confided to the gentleman tliatif hehad
anything to say that was the worse for himself be
needn’t proceed. By this time, however, he had
sworn to tell the whole truth, and he told it
elaborately. And so on to the third of the revela-
tions. There was no doubt about that decree

A story of domestic infelicity is going the
rounds of the Maoriland press. The husband, to
annoy his wife, insisted on turning the pictured
face of his ma-in-law to the wall, declaring it
made him bilious. The wife retaliated by taking
a tin whistle to bed with her, and blowing it
hard during the noisy watches of the night.
Then the husband applied to the Court for relief,
pleading that the tin whistle threatened to drive
him into a state of chronic insomnia. He wanted
the lady “bound over” or something, but she
was merely ordered to pay her own costs, and a
flabbergasted Court dismissed the case.

Australians are known the world over for
their love of sport and their determination to
excel in all out-of-door games. Angier’s Emulsion
is known the world over for its power to cure
coughs, heal the lungs, and build up strength. It
is the most palatable of all emulsions, and a
great aid to digestion. In three sizes, of all
chemists.*
Thb learned dames of Melbourne Austral
Salon sat down lately to consider the same old
question of the scarcity and incompetence, of
domestic servants ; and after much confab it was
decided that a “training school for domestics”
was the only remedy. Which is all right; though
The Bulletin wants at least a wing of it boarded
off and turned into a training school for mistresses.

On the few
tons of data
which the N.S.
Wales Miners’
Accident Relief
Fund has col-
lected in its
seven years of
life, the New-
castle miner is
liable to be
brought home
on a shutter
oftener than any
other in N. S.
W ales. Th e
Broken Hill
miner, however,
either gets killed
oftenest or leaves
the most widows
and children
when he is killed.
That is shown by
the fact that,
though all sorts
of miners pay in
the same sum per
week, and the
same scale of
benefits applies
all round, it has
taken 31 per
cent, of the con-
tributions at
Broken Hill to
meet fatal acci-
dent claims, as
against 16 per
cent, at New-
castle and 29 per
cent, in the
Southern (Illa-
warra) collieries.
On the other
hand, disable-
ments took 30
per cent, of the
contributions at
Newcastle, 21 at
Broken Hill, and
17 in the Southern collieries. Up to now, the Wes-
tern (Lithgow) coal mines have had a first-rate
record ; both sorts of payments lumped together
only amount to a shadow over 1§ per cent, of the
contributions—less than one-seventeenth of the
Newcastle proportion. Mt. Kembla, on account
of the catastrophe of 1902, is the mine that makes’
by far the biggest drain on the funds ; last year,
the contributions there amounted to only 11404,
whereas the payments to widows and others ran
to £2346.

The repeated infliction of the fine of £lOO
whenever an undesirable Chow- escapes from his
ship into the Commonwealth is having its effect.
Last June, for instance, Wong Ah Fook removed
himself from the s.s. Harbart into Lilly Buck-
stleet, Melbourne, and dwelt there till the vessel
sailed without him. Before the Harbart left one
of the officers noticed Wong’s absence ; but,
instead of reporting the matter and getting his
skipper or his owners fined, he took his
Chow bo’sun aside and requested him to
discover Wong, or any old Chow who would
pass for Wong. The bo’sun acquired a yellow
alien somehow and somewhere, soothed him
while the boarding inspector tallied the undesir-
ables and certified them as correct, and carted
him away in the ship to foreign parts. A little
later Ton Neng vanished from the ship Wimble-
don, and his disappearance was duly reported.
Inspector Christie, skirmishing round Melbourne,
happened across a new-chum Chow, ran him in,
and tested him ; and, as he failed to pass the test,
Christie put him down as Ton Neng, and had him
remanded for deportation. But the Wimbledon’s
captain came along and said this new-chum Chow
wasn’t Ton Neng at all, whereupon the unknown
confessed that he was Wong Ah Fook, late of the
Harbart. Ton Neng is, therefore, still missing,
and an unknown Chinkie, who was alleged to be
Wong Ah Fook, but evidently wasn’t, is sailing the
briny and getting a steady reply of “No savee”
in answer to his question of “Whaffor ?” As
matters stand, the Wimbledon’s captain is £lOO
out; the Harbart is “in ” the amount of Wong’s
overdue wages, but, per contra , it probably has a
very angry Chow to keep in order ; and Ton Neng
—well, Heaven only knows what has happened to
Ton, or where he is, or, in fact, who he is. These
Chows are a most unsatisfactory herd.

held by the drivers of butchers’ carts. In a recent
police-court case the Stipendiary asked a witness
if he had taken anything to drink before break*
fast on a certain day. “ Oh, not more than seven
or eight,” he promptly replied. “Eh, what?
What are you?” “I drive a butcher’s cart.”
“ How many do you get through in a day—drinks
I mean ? ” “ Some days about 30 or 40 —average
say about 35.” “ Call the next witness.” He was
also a driver of a butcher’s cart, but his average
was 60 drinks per day.

“Dormant”: Ballarat, the erstwhile
golden city of Victoria, is in a bad way. The
shifting of the McKay Harvester Works gave it a
real Tommy Burns. Big landlords block settle-
ment round about, and the mines are dead, like
Blastus, the King’s chamberlain. Only one or
two factories are left —two, I think, as I heard a
man calling out on the corner of the street,
“Who’ll have the last two for a bob?” No
credit is given, unless a declaration is produced,
signed before a P.M. (they won’t stand J’s.P.),
stating there are to be paying guests in the house,
during the South-street competitions. These are
Ballarat’s only visible honest support now, and if
you haven’t them you’re a deadbeat, with your
hair sticking through the shattered crown of your
hat. The Besses o’ th’ Barn cancelled their
engagement at Ballarat on account of the poor
booking of seats. The English cricketers have
decided to avoid Ballarat like a bankrupt serpent.
Latelv an affable person came from Melbourne,
and rented one of the many empty houses for a few
weeks. He was not overburdened with furniture
and effects—just carried a portmanteau with a bit
of plaster-of-Paris in it, and a few other little
things necessary for the manufacture of the kind
of half-crown that doesn’t ring too well when
foolishly thrown on a counter. After six weeks’
work he started to get rid of his load of spuriqus
stuff in the city of statues; but after passing
three, and receiving 2s. 3d. change in each case, he
found that he had cornered allthesilver in Ballarat,
and he had to seek fresh fields. Being a firm
believer in local industry, he paid his rent with
locallv manufactured coin. The detectives
arrested the plaster-of-Paris after a violent
resistance.
THE MAN-MACHINE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
As to the difficulty of handling heavy wheat bags,
farmers assert that not reduction in the size of the bags,
which would add to the cost of production, but the in-
creasing use of machinery ... must be relied upon to
save the wheat-lumpers from unnecessarily heavy and
exhausting work.— Argus, 29/7/’O7.
There’s sweat upon the brow of him who lumps the
bulging jute
With stony heart and loaded limb, truck-feeding sling
and chute ;
In rolling dust, red morn till eve, till noon again, there
comes
Dead, wearing weight for him to heave while yet the
donkey drums;
And, though jute-shysters track to town with good
black on their backs,
Though, clad in cords of easy brown —plain, town-cut,
lounging-slacks—
The acre-owner breakfasts with the Argus near his nose,
Up to his lumpin’ William Smith in bluey-wreckage goes.
The hairy-faced Conservative who grows the golden
grain
Smells robbery when he must give fair pleasure for their
pain
Who work for him ; with plot and plan he saves his silly
ways,
While brokers squeeze him—wild old man for whom the
country prays!
Down in the den of thieves who mesmerise him —mad
old man—
The jute-shark even savages his brother, when he can.
The lumper-lad, from him alone the road to wealth is
barred;
The upper and the nether stone, they grind him good
and hard.
And yet, he owns a fat, proud soul, who spoils these man-
machines.
He starves them with a niggling dole out of his miser-
means.
He sees no sin in freightage-fraud—when railroad-gods
rebate
It is his pleasant way to laud the too complaisant State ;
He whines for elevators, and wants State funds shovelled
out
That Smith may find a helping hand to hump big wheat
about;
He is a bold, mean, scalping card, intent to buy and sell
Tough Bill, whose toil is shameful hard—whose feet take
hold on Hell!

At Canterbury (Sydney), a while ago, the
police interrupted a cock fight, and proceeded
against seven persons under an Act which says:—
Whoever encourages, aids, or assists in the fighting- or
baiting of any animal shall upon conviction before a jus-
tice be liable to a penalty not exceeding £5.
It looks plain enough, but the amazing magistrate
who heard the case dismissed the information on
the extraordinary ground that there was no evi-
dence that the place where the seven were arrested
had ever been used for cockfighting before. If this
decision was sound, it implied that, provided the
cockfighters moved the scene of their cruelties to a
fresh spot every time, no conviction could ever be
obtained, and that, on a quiet Sunday, rooster
struggles could be held with impunity on Circular
Quay. On appeal, a Judge upset the absurd
theory that almost any cruelty can be perpetrated
upon animals provided it is done on a fresh spot,
and sent the case back for trial. But where does
the haughty pigeon-assassin come in ? Surely
there is some clause to meet the case of that
shocking ruffian, and he is generally to be found
at the old blood-stained spot.

A recent letter from Mr. A. Jennings, of
Coffs Harbor (N.S.W.), to Sydney City Council
recalls an Australian pioneer of the “System”
days. The little ship Rover was built in N.S.W.,
about 70 years ago, and was used to convey con-
victs to the coast settlements. Sixty years ago
the Rover was wrecked in Broulee Bay, on the
N.S.W. North Coast, and passed out of history
till the other day, when an easterly gale gathered
up the battered ruin, and drove it close inshore,
People who boarded it found the timber? still
sound. A few crumbling muskets and a cannon
are all the ironmongery that survive. Mr. Jen-
nings is sending the cannon along to the City
Council as a birthstain, or something.

“Stony”: A yarn about an unregene-
rate Chow. One of the employees at Syd-
bourne’s long-distance gaol, Darlingridge, has
a lovely daughter
of some 39 summers.
This charming girl,
who is of a mis-
sionary turn of
mind, noticed that
a Chow prisoner,
employed to dig in
the garden of the
gaol, never smiled.
He was a stranger
in a strange land,
and a Chow at that,
all ready for the
seed to be sown ;
so she took him out
a cup of tea, to
start with. But
l the Chow never
I smiled. The mis-
' sionary kept up
her practice of
supplying the
hand-out for a
considerable time,
now and then ae-
companying it
with a few words
of advice. And
even then the
Chow never
smiled. But, one
day, after a num-
ber of monoton-
ously smileless
afternoons, as the
missionary am-
bled down to John
Bad Lot with his
tea, she tripped
and fell, and
bruised her face
and arms, and
covered herself
with mud, broken
crockery and tea.
Whereupon the
Chow stopped his
work and burst into
a loud roar of hearty
and unfeigned laughter, and just left
her lying where she fell. At that stage the
missionary ceased her missionising. She had
done her work, and brought light and gladness
to the heart of a sombre stranger in the land, and
yet she wasn’t satisfied.

“Happy is the nation whose people
marry young”—but, judging by the August
Divorce Sittings in Melbourne, when it does
marry young, the proportion of misfits is liable
to be pretty large. A couple, who started
married life at 21 and 18 respectively, found
six years sufficient to wreck their dream of
bliss, the lady in this case transferring her
affections to a Chow. Twenty-one and 17
were wedded five years ago, and last week
Justice A’Beckett gave them their liberty again.
Twenty-one and 20 also found life awry. Twenty-
two and 21 got their decree, 22 in this case having
left 21 at the church door “to go and make a
home for her,” and, after six years of vain effort,
concluded that “ the marriage was a mistake, and
she could do what she liked.” Twenty also asked
the Judge to release him from 21, whom he had
married only last September. He had left his
bride with her parents while he went up from
Queenscliff to Melbourne to furnish his house;
but 21 wearied of her grasswidowhood within a
week, and found a substitute for the hubby who
was buying the furniture. At the other
end of life’s calendar was 71, who sought freedom
from 69, his bride of 1862. It scarcely seems
worth the trouble at that age.

“ Flinderino ” : The Bulletin (8/9/’O7)
mentions that the coal-lighter, John W. Dare, 76
years of age, is the oldest hulk in Melbourne
waters. I know it’s rude to contradict, but
still- While fossicking the other day under
the Yarra wharves and jetties, and amongst the
barnacles in Rotten Row, I happened upon an
ancient craft that is old enough to be the Jack
Dare’s father. This interesting piece of marine
architecture is the Augustus, at one time a pilot
boat on the Hooghly. The Augustus is 93 years
old, having been built in Java in 1814. It is
lying partly submerged at the back of Coode
Island, in the now unused portion of the Yarra
known as Humbug Reach. Another old “has-
been ”in the Yarra is the Proteus. It was put
together 92 years ago at Java, and, in its present
dilapidated condition, would easily be mistaken
for a sister ship to Noah’s Ark.

The melancholy tale of the bankrupt
pocket-handkerchief municipality of Camperdown
(Sydney) is still told at intervals. Camperdown
went broke as the result of a career of aldermanic
muddle and riot, and the bailiff was put in by the
creditors after the jamboree was over. He is still
in, collecting the miserable little bit of revenue on
the creditors’ account. The highways of Camper-
down are hardly cleaned at all now ; the removal
of house refuse takes its chance to a great extent;
and garbage collects horribly in the quieter streets.
Camnerdown, almost in the heart of the metro-
politan area, is going back to savagery, and is
likely soon to be the breeding ground of a
pestilence. A while ago the city of Sydney
offered to take it over, pay out the bailiff,
put the finances in order, and drastically clean
up. The Camperdown aldermen said the pro-
posed cleaning up was too drastic, and the
negotiation fell through on a question of excessive
or superfluous wash. Then Camperdown offered
itself as a willing but insanitary bride to the
adjacent municipality of Newtown; but Newtown,
so far, has not taken the unwholesome object to
its arms. It is becoming urgently necessary for
Parliament to take some measures with this
malodorous thing, which has died on Sydney’s
premises. The shortest way would be an Act of
Parliament annexing Camperdown to Sydney,
without any question of the feelings of the local
aldermen. The public health is of more account
than the feelings of aldermen —especially such
aldermen.

The case of a divided family is running
its course in Adelaide. Father said things about
son. Son sued him. Court called it slander, and
gave damages against the aged predecessor.
Now, the son, having waited a year and not got
his money, has his progenitor arrested. The
ancestor, being penniless, goes insolvent in forma
pauperis— and the son figures in Court as “oppos-
ing creditor.” That is as far as the animosity has
got at present.

The present arguments oVer widening
George-street North and other Sydney streets
recall a superstition of the early days. “Make
streets narrow, run them north and south, or
where that is impossible, bend them here and
there,” were early surveying directions. The idea
was, that when houses were built on either side,
the streets would be protected from the sun.
Gipps, an early Governor, had the fad badly, and
was father of many narrow streets in Sydney and
Brisbane. He raised a historic quarrel at Ipswich
(Q.) over the matter, the issue being ultimately
carried against him. A wonderful faith in cold
and dirt and gloom had those early Governors—
bleak animals from England, who couldn’t realise
that in two erenerations the people of the new
land would become veritable Children of the Sun,
and be all the better for the change.
* * * *
Some time ago the directors of Sydney’s
Prince Alfred Hospital induced the Government
to build two new pavilions ; but when the build-
ings were finished the directors found out—if they
didn’t know it before—that they could neither
provide the 200 beds nor maintain the patients to
fill them. Consequently the Board now makes
the cheeky proposal that the Government shall
close the general wards of its own hospital at
Little Bay, and send the 200 patients treated there
to fill the empty new pavilions of the Alfred.
But the directors don’t propose to relieve the
State of the expense of those patients ; they want
£5O per bed per annum, which means an endow-
ment, or subsidy, or anything you like to
call it, of £lO,OOO a year to this hospital, nomi-
nally “supported by voluntary contributions,”
and managed by a Board elected by subscribers.
Meantime it is alleged that the Prince Alfred
hasn’t got proper accommodation for the nurses
and staff of the hospital even now, when the new
pavilions are not in use for patients ; in fact, it is
alleged that part of the new pavilions has been
seized upon as nurses’ temporary quarters, and
that, if 200 more patients come in, then the Board
will have to provide accommodation for nurses
outside the hospital. Presumably the end
would be that the State would be tapped for a
few thousands more to provide quarters for the
extra staff. “Prince Alfred ” rather prides itself
upon being an.Anti-Sosh institution. Its Board,
anyhow, is blotted all over with prominent Anti-
Soshers ; and they are keeping up the Anti-Sosh
reputation all right, by the vigorous manner in
which they hold out the hat of cadge to the State.

The Melbourne management of the Com-
mercial Bank has struck terror to the souls of its
old employees. Recently some five responsible
position-holders—-managers of branches, accoun-
tants, etc. —received their conge for no visible
reason save that they were receiving salaries of
some importance. The unfortunate five had
grafted for 30 years, more or less, subsisting
during the broken boom period on humble pay,
and drawing comfort from the assurance that
when palmy days returned they would get due
consideration for having stuck to their guns.
Now the fellows who stuck are receiving the in-
glorious sack, their positions being filled by
inferior-salaried men, while boy labor at very
little per annum is being pushed in with rapidity.
A veiled reference to this “ retrenchment” policy
was made at the general meeting held a week or
so back, when
A shareholder drew attention to the fact that no men-
tion had been made of the status of the clerks. The
shareholders, he said, would not like to see any sweating.
The Chairman: That is entirely a departmental
question. Every half-year the salaries of the staff are
under review, and we believe that the staff is thoroughly
satisfied with what the directors decide.
Right through the staff of the Commercial there
is dissent, and the rumble thereof has been the
talk of banking circles. Meanwhile the dis-
charged employees are worried with family
responsibilities, and find it difficult to obtain
work owing to their ignorance of all business save
the octopus system, which they have spent their
lives in learning.

Bulletin Office, Monday, 9.3op.m.—This
paper begs to report the receipt, this afternoon
and evening, of 16 letters to the effect that: (1)
The laughing jackass habitually lifts live snakes
in the air and drops them (once or oftener), and
eats them when they have been killed by much
dropping; (2) the laughing jackass can’t and
doesn’t and wouldn’t think of lifting snakes; (3)
the jackass only eats animals it has killed itself ;
(4) the jackass eats almost anything, alive or
dead, provided it isn’t too large. Before this final
rush of jackass correspondence came to
hand, isolated jackass letters had been
dropping in. The most interest-
ing of these were marked
“ Abo.” in the left hand
top-corner and sent across
to the printer. About
noon the boss printer—
who is a wise and judi-
cious man, and who
really edits the paper by
deciding what matter he
won’t set when he has
twice as much matter as
he can set in the time at
his disposal—represent-
ed that the amount of
kookaburra copy which
he had on hand was
really alarming. He was
quieted by an assurance
that an effort would be
made to keep down the
kookaburra copj' as m ueh
as possible. Then the
staff went out to lunch,
and came back to find
nine more letters re the
laughing jackass and the
snake, and the other
seven letters about the
laughing jackass and the
snake dribbled in during
the afternoon. They
are about equally divi-
ded ; half say the jackass
jifts the snake and half say
it doesn’t. Therefore, barring
the letters which have been
already sent to the printer, and which will
appear by instalments, unless the printer
thinks better of it, it seems advisable to
close the debate. The verdict is that the kooka-
burra mostly lives on carrion, and that the tomtit
is in the habit of lifting the python to the height
of half a mile, and dropping it on top of the
N.S.W. new syllabus (which is also a disputed
question), whereby the syllabus has been bashed
out of all shape and is now almost past recogni-
tion. The connection between these matters and
the number of gates that you have to open as you
drive from Broken Hill to the Queensland border
is a matter of uncertainty.

“Some little time ago,” says Mr. J. G.
Boyle, Kelmscott, W.A., “I was suffering from
8, severe cough, which threatened to take a serious
form. Hearing so much about Chamberlain’s
Cough Remedy I decided to give it a trial, and to
my great satisfaction was completely cured by the
time I had finished the first bottle.”*
“ Jimmie Pannikin ” : The Red Page man
makes rude remarks about the “ Abo” correspon-
dent. Let me say this —the genuine, old-estab-
lished Abo-contributor does not need a handy
reference library ; he has his book of notes made
on the spot, and the well-stored memory of a
trained observer. Writing of Le Souef’s observa-
tions, he says, triumphantly : “He knows, for
instance, exactly where the pelican builds its
nest.” Well, I’m not a trained naturalist, but I
also have that exact knowledge ; so have a small
crowd of Barrierites, who shoot east and west-
o’-Darling. In 1904 I visited a huge pelican
rookery near Windamingle, on the Anabranch.
The smell would just have fascinated the Stinking
Fish party. There is no great mystery to out-
backers about where the pelican builds its nest.
To my mind, a rarer nest is that of the bower
bird. During my three years of out-back exile
and experience I did not come across one bower.
I was once taken to see a left bower, not far
from Port Pooncarie (please do NOTomit “Port”),
but the nest had vanished. Will some Abo-T.T.
kindly send me a photo of a genuine bower bird’s
nest? I don’t want a studio-fake. P.S., also
N.B. : “ T.T.” stands for truth-teller.

“ Smiff ” draws a picture of Mackay (Q.): —
Mackay is busy manufacturing evidence in favor of a
cheap-labor immigration policy; and we, who are at
present doing the toil, supply the raw material. In some
of the sugar centres —Bundaberg - , Proserpine, Lower
Burdekin, Mulgrave, and Mossman —harvesting is in full
swing, and the growers seem to be of one mind that labor
is both plentiful and reliable. The Mulgrave mill, after a
couple of weeks’ work, had the unique experience of
requesting white cutters to cease toil for a few days to
enable the mill to overtake the cane supply. Yet in this
nigger-loving district of Mackay labor is scarce, and the
scarcity of it will, I admit, seriously affect harvesting.
There will be a squeal in consequence ; but before any-
body takes the squeal seriously, he ought to find out why
labor is scarce here, when it isn’t scarce elsewhere.
The fact is that the position taken, up by the farmers
during the past few months has not only driven good
white workers out of the district, but has practically
prevented the influx of good sound labor, usual at this
period. For weeks past the local Farmers’ Association
has advertised broadcast its intention to only pay
£1 per week and found in the “ off ’’ season, and £1 ss.
during crushing ; and this when other districts have
been engaging labor for the crushing at from £1 10s. to
£1 17s. 6d., and even £2 per week, and found. Time
after time, for months past, the local Sugar Workers’
Union has endeavored to arrange a conference with
the Farmers’ Association to fix a scale of wages, but
the cookies delayed matters until the eve of operations,
and then their delegates attended with a scale drawn up
by themselves, and intimated that the workers’ delegates
must agree to if, as they (the cockies’delegates) had no
authority to vary it. And the cockies called it a con-
ference ! Of course, the “conference” was abortive.
How could it be otherwise? Have seen the scale sub-
mitted by the workers, and am of opinion that it erred
on the side of moderation, especially regarding contract
rates, which were in some cases 20 per cent, less than in
other districts. For a 15 to 18 ton crop the Mackay
workers asked for 4s. per ton ; Richmond River pays 3s.
to ss. ; Mossman, ss. ; and Mulgrave, ss. 6d.
I have spent over 20 years in the Queensland sugar
districts (am at present cane-cutting), and, speaking
generally, for narrow-minded stupidity the local cockies
take the whole aerated bread emporium. The prevailing
Mackay idea about sug-ar-cane growing is simply—Make a
hole in the ground, put in a cane plant (any sort; if
Jones has none, get some from Brown), stamp on it,
and call round in 15 months or so to cut it.
Lantana and other abominations have an undisturbed
time, and the farmer who doesn’t farm is surprised at his
crop failure, endeavors to throw the onus of hisignorance
or indolence on to the poor devils of white slaves, and
declares he cannot afford to pay decent wages. Multiply
this item by a few hundred, and a sort of idea can be
formed of cane cultivation in this district.
The existing conditions as to accommodation and food
are abominable. Most of the white workers have to camp
in filthy hovels. I worked for one cocky, grubbing, at a
pound a week and found, and had to provide my own tent
and utensils. At the same time four or five others were
camped in the stable. When I say in the stable, I mean
the stable. Horses had one half, men the other half, and
there was no dividing partition.
THE EDITOR'S TOPHET.
A probably apochryphal yarn from the
North :
A gem buyer with the usual foreign name, who did
business at Anakie (Q.), despatched per post some of the
stones as a present to a European President. The parcel
reached its destination in due course, but when the
secretary caught sight of the word “Anakie” on the
label he fled, and gave orders for the destruction of the
packet with great caution and much despatch. After-
wards he read the accompanying letter, and learned that
there was no material connection between the words
“ Anakie ” and “ Anarchy.”

DOUBTFUL.
G INGER: “ Don't you be frightened, Mister, I won't let him touch yer!"
“Snell” : I knew the Heegans and the
Hogans were deadly enemies, although I was only
a casual visitor at Speargrass. The Heegans and
the Hogans were neighboring selectors, and the
feud had sprung up like Jonah’s brolly in a night,
for one morning Hogan descended upon Heegan
with much bull-roaring, and incapacitated him for
two days with a wild whirling of arms and legs.
After that a Hogan never met a Heegan without
a similar manifestation of antipathy, and the
Hogan was mostly triumphant for he had the
weight and the venom, and thrice is he armed
who has his quarrel just. This much was told to
me, but I had the good fortune to witness the
denouement. Hogan was sinking a well. It was
down about 30ft. I happened to be overlooking
operations on the second day of my visit, when
Hogan’s boy, Daniel, went up to the house for a
drink. Heegan had, apparently, been waiting
this opportunity, for he made out of the saplings,
and ran to the mouth of the well. “ Hogan, yeh
dirthy crawler! ”he cried. Hogan looked up,
“ Heegan !” he yelled “ What ’re ye doin’ on me
land, ye thafe iv th’ wor-rld? Be me soul, I’ll
kick* the head off yeh—l will.” Hogan started
to climb up the rope, and Heegan grasped a half-
hundredweight of bluestone. “Iv yeh stir another
fut, Tim Hogan,” he said, “I’ll bat yer back in.”
He held the rock ready for a drop, and Hogan
promptly flopped into the mud and water at the
bottom of the well. He arose raving, and hurled
threats and profanity at his enemy. “I’m th’
paceful, neighborly man, Tim Hogan,” said
Heegan, “ ’n’ now I have yeh under me thumb,
it’s an explanation I mane t’ have. What d’yah
mane be ut, Hogan ? Ewhat have I done by yeh
that yeh turn on me ’n’ bate me wid every
chance ?” “ Yeh insulted me fam’ly ! ” screamed
Hogan. “I did not.” “Yeh did, yeh liar!”
“Nothin’ iv th’ kind.”. “’Twas yer mane,

satisfied that the quarrel was beyond all recon-
ciliation, for he set down his stone with a sigh,
and went home.

“ J.R.” : Giving evidence before N.S.W.
Timber Commission, the N.S.W. State Govern-
ment Architect made a statement which, though
true, will be news to a good many people :
The sandy beaches south of Sydney are similar to
country near the Bay of Biscay, where large tracts are
planted with pine and other woods which have grown to
perfection.
Wonderful how we gather up scraps of miscel-
laneous information. Another witness, a day or
two before, said the only real softwood in N.S.W.
is “hoop pine,” which grows in abundance all
along the coast in the poorest sandy soils. It
used to be called “Maryborough pine,” and was
sold under that name in quantities in Sydney.
The “similar country near the Bay of Biscay ” is
the stretch of coast-line between the mouths of
the Garonne and the Adour, which, less than 300
years ago, was very like the Bondi and Botany
sandhills, well known to Sydney people. It
was reclaimed by an “Intendant of Gascony,”
under the orders of the wise Colbert. Colbert
directed the planting of hardy pines to supply
timber (especially spars) and pitch for the French
navy, which in those days of wars with England
was always in danger of being cut off from the
Baltic, the usual source of supply. If there were
a man as wise as Colbert in power in N.S.W. it
wouldn’t be long before all the desolate sandhills
along the coast were planted with hoop-pine.

“ Emubush ” writes :
I want to make a few remarks about an excrescence in
the new Cornstalk syllabus. My only child (a girl of
nine) is suffering from the effects of arresced sneeze
She attends a big suburban school, where the hideous
silence bell is an adoration —I mean an institution. A few
minutes before the last bell, which is the signal for falling
in line, the silence bell is rung. When it sounds, all
talking, all laughter, all movement, all signs of intelli-
gent and happy child life must cease immediately. Every-
body is expected to be dead standing up. The play-
ground looks as if the children had suddenly become
petrified. There are half-finished smiles, abruptly-ended
sentences, arrested sneezes, never-finished movements.
The unfortunate pupils stand still and mummified till the
last bell sounds. Three weeks ago my girl was just going
to sneeze when the silence bell rang. For ten seconds
she held out, turning purple and swelling to twice her
natural size. Then she sneezed internally, and she has
never been the same since. Moreover she has sustained
other injuries. The day after she sneezed inwardly she
was doing a high jump when the bell rang. She remained
up in the air, not daring to come down, and the strain
has told on her. I don't think much of this new syllabus,
whatever your correspondent, “Jimmie Pannikin” or
“ James Dish,” may say about it.
AN ALPHABETICAL AUSTRALIAN ANECDOTE—BY
THE BOUNDARY-RIDER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
A was an ant of the sojer sort
What sat on a sun-baked plain ;
B was the bite that he bit me with,
And O was a cry of pain.
D was the d—n that I d—d him with,
E was its echoing roll ;
F was the fear that I’d sat too ’ard
On the top of a red-’ot coal.
G was the grease-stained moleskin pants
Which I had to get up and rub,
And H my haste as I humped myself 1 «yk.
To the bar of the nearest pub.
I was the Inn where the snake-juice flows,
An’ yer drought-struck throat gets sluiced ;
J was a “ jag ” of the good old sort,
An’ the “jumps” that “ jag'” produced.
K was the kind of a time I ’ad ;
L was a large-sized ’ead ;
M was a mouth like a quick-lime pit,
Or a mug full of melted lead.
N was the nasty things I saw
As I lay on my back all day,
Which goggled their eyes as they grinned at me
In the reg’lar jim-jarn way.
O was an Owl of the 'ard-boiled kind,
Which I certainly' seemed to be ;
P was the pledge which I took before
- A remarkably fat J.P.
Q was the quilh which would not keep still
As I signed my name, dead slow ;
And R the respectable life I thought
I'd lead for a month or so.
S was the swag which I ’umped next day,
When the boss give me the sack ;
T was the terrible time I ’ad
With the station cooks out back.
U is the unkind way they ’as
With a cove when ’is luck is down ;
And V’s my vow to get square some day
When I meet them cooks in town.
W’s the well-cooked feeds you want
When the wallaby track you roam,
Which you never will get from a station cook
If y r ou tramp till the cows come home.
And now this alphabetical yarn
Must stop, for I may allege
That X Y Z are a bit too stiff
For a cove wot’s took the pledge.

“ Benicia” : In Maoriland, where almost
every imported wild animal flourishes till it
develops into a curse, the acclimatisator has
come to be regarded as the local Stinking Fish.
On the ground that everything imported must be
better than anything native, he has brought in
the skylark, blackbird, thrush* finch, starling,
minah, linnet, sparrow, pheasant, quail, partridge,
rabbit, ferret, stoat, weasel, hawk, red deer
fallow deer, axis, Ceylon elk, hare, opossum,
bumble bee, trout, aide-de-camp, etc. Some oi
these have panned out well; some have been 10
different kinds of horror and disaster. They were
thrown into the country promiscuously, and the
results were various. The latest trouble is the
Tasmanian opossum. It has flourished like the
green bay tree, and is so earnestly trying its claws
on the young native trees that it has become the
most promising ringbarker in all Maoriland. A
perfect frenzy of ringbarking appears to have
seized upon it, and it is behaving as it never did
in its native land, and people begin to believe
that one ’possum can destroy a whole young
plantation. The Government, and especially
Lands Minister McNab, refuses to permit the
shooting of the ’possum in Maoriland, on the
ground that it does no serious damage in Aus-
tralia, which is just as satisfactory for the people
interested as the assurance that the rabbit isn’t
bad in Timbuctoo, and hasn’t undermined the
throne of Siam. Apparently it is the want of his
accustomed gum-leaves that has made the ’possum
turn into a bark fiend, and now Maoriland sees
nothing for it save to import 500,000 gum-trees to
ameliorate its ’possum—unless, of course, it takes
the other alternative and ringbarks Minister
McNab. Meanwhile, alarm has been excited by
a rumor that the Acclimatisation Society means
to import giraffes, which will look down cottage
chimneys while ladies are going to bed at night.
COULDN’T STAND IT.
REFORMED GENT : “ Friends, it’s a month to-day
since I gave up the drink, and I’ve saved
enough to buy a coffin; and if I keep off
drink another month I'll ’ave to use it.”
“ J.G. finds some more of the serfs of
the cow
Who says the Factories Act should not be applied to the
country districts of Victoria? I know a woman who car-
ries on a dairying business, or, rather, it is carried on for
her by three school-girls—two boarded-out ehddren, at no
remuneration a week, and a borrowed niece, at nothing
every seven days. One of these kids has to get up before
daylight, trudge a few miles, and bring home the cows. The
others have to get breakfast for themselves, the missus,
and the cow-girl. The missus’s breakfast is eaten in bed.
C -tn le M lip ’ ' he (f”w s
milked bv the girls (nine cows per girl), the separating
done and the separator cleaned ; and after that the three
slaves are supposed to get ready and go to school. The
missus stops in bed until she gets hungry, and has to get
up for a feed. Then she wishes that there were a few
more school holidays, so that she wouldn’t have to get
her own tucker so often. The miserable girls come home
from school to find cow again awaiting them. They have
their tea about 9 p.m., shamble through their home-
lessons, go to bed, sleep a few hours, and awake to more
cow. This world is full of cow.
A MATTER OF TIGHTNESS.

Working on the Johnstone River, North
Queensland, right in the heart of the tropical
regions in which the black-labor party once
asserted white labor could not stand cane work, a
gang of 11 white men, in 21 working days, lately
loaded 278 trucks with 759 tons of cane. The
work included laying and shifting the portable
lines, and hauling the trucks out and in. The
actual cane handled was 3 tons 7 cwt. per man per
day, and the wage earned amounted to 11s. 5Jd. per
day, including the cook ; and there’s a 10 per
cent, bonus to come for those who conclude the
season. The silence of the large Queensland cane-
growers who said that white men couldn’t work in
cane, no matter what price was offered, is grow-
ing quite depressing in the face of such records

“ David H. Richards ” : Some time back
a heavy-weight squatter was taken ill, and on
I icing brought to Sydney for treatment was told
that his case was hopeless—
he couldn’t live more than
a month or two. To make
the best of matters he
arose, and went out on a
final burst ; and then,
being particular about his
wooden mackintosh, he
looked up a ghoul, and
was measured for a gor-
geous polished oak “cask-
I et,” with silk lining, etc.
The box was built and de-
livered to his hotel, and,
after much trouble with
the manager, it was
| smuggled upstairs, where
Mr. Jumbuck packed it
with his wife’s purchases.
He left for the homestead,
and his luggage caused
! I much excitement “N root.”
I I At home the dying sheep-
' man put his future resting-
place under the bed, and
used it to keep his clothes
in. But several months
elapsed, and he exhibited no
signs of an early demand for the
box, so he decided that better use could
be made of so expensive an article. He sug-
gested to his other half that it would hold her
dresses very nicely, but the lady disapproved of
the idea. So he stood it up on end, put in a
few shelves, fitted hinges on the lid, and made it
into a grog-cupboard.

There was to be an inquest in the morning
at the Dingo Plotel, on the Dry River, near
Perishville, and the body which had blown out
its vital spark lay in the “parlor,” so the talk in
the bar was restrained and lugubrious. The
archaic human with a frayed swag said that the
sight of a corpse always upset him since a certain
incident, and after considerable drink he yielded
to popular pressure. It seemed that he was pad
ding it on the Western plains, making for Carinda,
when he came across a man lying beside the fence.
Closer inspection convinced him that the man
had given up the ghost. “I jist took a casual
look over him,” said the ancient padder, “but he
didn’t seem to have nothin’ o’ value, so I left him
as he was, an* come on and told the police. Next
day the traps brought the body in, an’ I’m blowed
if they hadn’t found thirty odd quid in his hip
pocket. Since then the sight of a corpse has
always made me miserable.” “My oath ! I should
think so,” said everyone.
“ Tilga ” : Cave-guides’ statements are not
likely to be upset by “Pluto” (B. 11/7/’O7).
Their calculations, allowing a margin for imagina-
tion, are based upon careful measurements. The
amount of carbonate of lime held in solution by a
drop of water in a cave is much less than that con-
tamed by a similar drop under a
station arch. Water percolating
through limestone takes up much
less carbonate of lime than
water passing through mortar.
Let “Pluto ’dissolve equal
quantities of limestone and
mortar in water from the
same tap and he’ll see.
In reality, 'city water
is a more powerful
solvent than cave
water. The greater
the proportion of
carbonic acid
gas in water,
the greater the
amount of car-
bonate of lime
it can hold in
solution. Pure
mountain air
and city air
contain re-
spectively
about 2 "5 and
3'5 parts per
10,000 of 0.02.
Rain thus car-
ries down much
more of the said
gas in the city
than in the cave
country, and the
action of the
city drainage upon
lime is correspond-
ingly greater. Again,
the cave drop hangs
in motionless air of a
very low temperature,
whereas the arch drop is sub-
ject to the action of wind and to
greater heat, both of which tend to make evapora-
tion, and consequently the deposit of carbonate
of lime, more rapid. If the formation of stalac-
tites in our caves were as rapid as “Pluto’’argues,
there vvould be no caves—they’d have become solid
stalactites before Adam went looking for accom-
modation.
* * * *
“F.H.R.” : It seems pretty evident that
Mr. “ Cross Nibs ” (B. l/8/’O7) has never seen any
ringbarking done, or he’d never have listened to
his rabbity friend. They took a contract (no less)
for ten acres of ringbarking. Bear me, what an
enormous job ! Now, I’ve “rung” that much heavy
timber in two days, and, as the rate was eighteen
pence an acre, I wasn’t making a wharf-lumper’s
wages, at that. I might mention that eighteen
pence is a big price for ringing, and I have seen it
yone for as low as threepence per acre. I guess
“ Gross Nibs’ ” friend was well paid with the two
dollars, considering he hadn’t finished his colossal
contract of ten acres.
“ Flinderino ” : The fishermen on the
Victorian coast are petitioning to have an
open season proclaimed for seals. A few
years ago the number of seals on the
islands along the coast was estimated at about
200; now they are as plentiful as debts or stink-
wort. The fisherfolk declare that at some places
it is impossible to see the islands for seals. These
seals follow the fishing boats, and snap the barra-
coota off the lines as fast as the men hook them.
Where netting is being carried on, they tear the
nets and collar the fish. The toilers of the deep
say that unless something is done to reduce the
pest the fishing industry will cease to exist, as the
seals will scare all the fish from the coast; and
they assert that one of the gluttonous creatures is
capable of accounting for as many fish in one day
as would suffice an orphanage or lunatic asylum for
a month. The seals have been protected all the
year round in the past, but the Inspector of
Fisheries now suggests a close season of six months
only—from November to April.

“Sr” endorses the new fire-kindling
method :
Last Sunday, as the old man was getting ready to go
for his Sunday morning walk, I started experimenting’
with a handful of sugar on the fire, to test the correct-
ness of an “ Abo.” theory, that sugar is better than kero -
sene. The test was thoroughly successful. I set the
chimney of our humble cottage on fire.
The whole family went hysterical. The old man rushed
into the kitchen and yelled, ‘‘Shut the blessed doors 1
Shut the doors ! You’ll have the whole house afire ! ”
He then climbed on the roof and called for a bucket of
water. I couldn’t reach the bucket to him, so I tried to
lift the bucket up on the end of a broom and nearly
drowned myself.
“ Send in for Mr. Smith ” was the Superintendent’s
next order.
Smith is fat and fussy, like the old man. Smith rushed
in like a mad fire-cart.
Smith was then hauled on to the roof to give the old
man a leg up, as he couldn’t reach the chimney top. In
trying to balance the old man and the bucket, Smith col-
lapsed, and then there was a scramble on the roof that
filled the old tom-cat with envy. He had fought a hun-
dred fights on that roof, but had never made one-tenth
the row and bellowing of Smith.
Then they got an old wet bag. The old man descended
and instructed Smith to throw the bag down the chimney
when he sang out “ All right.” He cautiously entered
the kitchen, and began looking up the chimney for the
psychological moment. The bag came down. Smith
hadn’t waited for “the office.”
The old man rushed out, an astonishing picture in
black and white, his face, shirt, and Sunday suit be-
grimed with soot, and the bag on his head.
He addressed Smith from the yard in language that
you would not dare to publish. Smith got so excited
that he lost his hold on the chimney, slithered down the
roof, and fell. The cat escaped by a miracle. It had
been looking up and admiring the show.
The rest of the day was taken up with inquiries as to
how it happened. My dignity, as the eldest daughter of
the family, was grievously dispersed. I spent three hours
in the witness-box giving false evidence, and by the time
I was discharged.my best boy had got tired of waiting at
the corner, and had gone home.
Sugar is a better combustible than I thought.
HIS TROUBLES.
NEWSBOY : “ 'Ere y'are! ’ERALD a penny.
Another Yarrer ’orror!”
DRUNK : “My troubles what they say ’bout
me (hie).”
“ Hamer ” : Correspondents who seem to
admire the fighting qualities of the ant should
turn their attention to the domestic flea. I once
put two specimens in a bottle and the combat
*•* “ was as refreshing as.ay.hins that
that vessel had ever held—it was a whisky flask,
too. Directly they found that the glass yielded
no nourishment each seemed to decide that the-
other was its meat, and got to holts. It was such
a prolonged conflict that I reckoned I would have-
tea and come back for the last round, but when I
returned the fleas had vanished. Presumably
they had eaten one another.
A SUNDOWNER’S SONG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Come, mates, we’ll tramp the open track,
“Matilda” up, with swinging stride,
Though cookies curse and doom may crack,
Our knees are not yet old and slack.
Out where the skies are blue and wide
Bush birds cry “Spell, oh,” all the day,
Over the hills and far away.
Close streets we shun, and factory’s smoke
In towns where man but buys and sells ;
The foundry’s flare, the engine’s croak,
And sweated Labor’s heavy stroke
That beats to clang of clocks and bells.
But we work not by wage and shift ;
Like thistledown we drift and drifts
We love the air, we love the sun ;
We scent good tucker tracks, and tramp
The road that cuts through range and run,
To sneak at night, when work is done,
Hound shearing shed or mining camp.
From hand to mouth we live, nor wish
To toil with shears or digger’s dish.
We’re wastrels all; but whilst the trees
Shake glittering boughs, and gold’s the air,
When earth and sky breathe primal peace,
Honey we gather like wild bees, ■-
That buzz in sunshine here and there.
Unbroken Bush, unbroken Man
ltule, proud as when this world began.
Come, mates, ’tis time to tramp along
This lazy lane till doom my crack.
’Tis time to join the travellers’ throng,
Now through the Bush rings Freedom’s song,
Down ways that quit the beaten track,
Go twisting, shining, night and day,
Over the hills and far away.

Frederick Oliver Trench, third baron—the
Irish peer who wasn’t blown up the other day,
but might have been —is a Galway man, born in
1868, and succeeded his grandfather in 1894. His
“seat” is at Woodlawn, County Galway, and he
has “ a place ”in the County of Tipperary. He is
cousin to Robert Le Poer Trench, one time Attor-
ney-General in the Berry (Vic.) Ministry. One of
the family, who was a land agent, wrote “Reali-
ties of Irish Life,” from the rack-renting land-
lords’ agent point of view. One motto sported by
the family reads, “ If God be for Trench, who is
against him?” Come to think of it, the same
might be said of Smith or Briggs.
There seems, after all, to be a dash of the
gay old Profit breed in the (once) unkissed Glad-
stone Dowie. Till the age of 30, this awful young
man poseed, from behind a thicket of what
was really whiskering, but looked like imitation
Astrakhan fur, as one who had never been em-
braced by any female. Then he married Miss
Hofer, Swiss heiress, and about the same time
Zion filed its schedule, and went out of busi-
ness as a paying religious concern. Since when,
Gladstone, according to the Yankee papers, has
held the billet of manager of a “summer hotel ”
—and is no longer unkissed. He is, in fact,
altogether too popular for his wife’s liking, and
the has packed up her things and returned to
Switzerland. It is a big moral drop from the posi-
tion of totally unkissed saint to that of over-
hugged summer publican.
For almost the whole of the last fifteen
years Frederick Illingworth has been a member
of the Westralian Legislative Assembly. For
nearly the whole of his membership he has drawn
extra salary as a Minister, Chairman of Com-
mittees, deputy Speaker, or something rosy and
remunerative. He has now resigned his seat for
West Perth, and wants Parliament to give him a
retiring allowance. Of course Premier Moore is
quite agreeable—his deficit is only a quarter of a
million already—and only one member has had
the courage to express disapproval. In the present
state of Westralian finances it is shockingly dis-
honest to give a big retiring allowance to a third-
rate politician—not in the same street with Dibbs,
Berry, and other men who did some real service to
their respective States. Illingworth was a wrecked
land-boomer, who left Victoria when the crash
came—his share of the crash came early—and
found a peaceful haven in Perth. He had just
been elected to the Victorian House of Landlords
when he departed, and for weeks he obstinately
neglected to resign. Illingworth was returned three
times for various places in the Murchison—
mostly the same place with the name changed at
each election—and in his early days he and Vosper
(now dead), De Hamel (likewise dead), and G. T.
Simpson (also dead) made things very unpleasant
in the House for a very angry Bigjohn. Illing-
worth is a permanent and incurable teetotaller,
and is head of the “Church of Christ” in West-
ralia.
Francis Adams, for nearly 25 years general
manager of the Australian Joint Stock Bank, has
just resigned. “He leaves it a wealthy man,”
the Sydney dailies say, in a slobbering notice.
Considering the awful smash of the A.J.S., and
the wretched progress it has made since, it would
probably be more to his credit if he had left it as
poor as are the shareholders, whose affairs he was
supposed to look after. They sank, however;
he swam. He saved himself ; he couldn’t save
others—or, at least, didn’t. In the way of smash
what this bank accomplished was something
colossal. Two brothers obtained, on five stations
in N. S. Wales and six stations in the N. Terri-
tory and Queensland, advances of no less than
£707,421; and when two brothers owe a bank the
size of the A.J.S. £707,421, the bank doesn’t boss
them—they boss the bank. To nine people the
awful concern lent £1,214,319 ; and a few years
ago, when the thing was reckoned up inside the
bank, it was computed that £611,569 of this was
dead loss. The amazing part of it all was, that
the man who was general manager of the concern
with this awful record used to turn up pretty
regularly at bankers’ meetings, and let them know
how banks should be run.
“ Melb.” writes :
Our esteemed Rev. Evelyn Snodgrass, of St. Mark’s,
Fitzroy, returns here with a new name, that of Douglas.
The Bible says (Revelation 3, 12): “ I will write upon him
my new name.” Yet the old one had been honored in
Victoria. Peter Snodgrass was a brave man, engaged in a
fight with the earliest Victorian forerunners of Ned Kelly
and co. He became a well-known M.L.A. Miss Snodgrass,
afterwards Janet Mrs. Olarke, was a relative of his. She
had been governess in the family of W. J. Olarke, and is
mother of Clive Clarke. I rather fancy that Evelyn’s
relation to Janet Missus had a little to do with
his transference from quiet Balwyn to Fitzroy.
However, he is now the Rev. Evelyn Douglas. They say
it costs about £7O to change your name in legal form, as
he has done. The historic case is that of Joshua Bugg, a
fashionable hotelkeeper, of Brighton, or one of those
places. He changed to Norfolk Howard The conse-
quence is that when incoming tenants fear there may be
a need for insecticide they inquire, “ Hum—ah ! Any
Norfolk Howards about?” Henry Irving legally did
away with Brodribb, so that H.B.'and Lawrence Irving
are not Brodribbs.
Died lately in Melbourne Hospital, Richard
Charles Luscombe, aged 77 years. He was an
architect, but not a successful one; also, he was
one of the earliest of N.S.W. Protectionists, and
was vigorous if not eloquent. He was once in
N.S.W. Assembly as member for Northumber-
land, having got in on a small minority
vote, against a host of candidates, at a
by-election. While in the House, Parkes, with
the airy wit for which he was famous, called him
“a withered tarantula.” Next general election
deposited Luscombe at the bottom of the poll
with 176 votes. Dibbs made him Inspector of
Scaffolding as a reward for political services.
There was much need for some such official, but
Dibbs didn’t realise the need, and regarded the
appointment as a humorous way of providing for
a supporter. So no Act was passed to give the
new inspector any authority, and the old man—he
always looked older than his years—was laughed
at by obscene contractors.
Old Shareholder writes :
So Francis Adams of the A.J.S. Bank has gone out of
the business. Thank God ! He, and Gyles Turner of the
Commercial of Australia, and Drury‘(deceased) of the
Queensland National, managed the three banks which,for
size of smash and long continuance of misfortune, put up
the record of the last two decades. True, the Bank of
South Australia is gone utterly, likewise the City
of Melbourne, Federal, Colonial of Maoriland, Mercantile
of Sydney, Mercantile of Melbourne, Bank of V.D.L.,
and most of the land banks. But the biggest of these was
at best a comparatively small affair. And the B.N.Z.
made almost a record smash, but then it has also made a-
record recovery. The Awful Three haven’t fully re-
covered, and they still live, but the living of the
A.J.S. Bank is the least ornamental of all. Drury
died recently, and his Q. N. Bank is getting into
better order. Gyles Turner retired in course of time,
and his bank also shows signs of improvement; it seems
to improve much better under his successor’s manage-
ment than under his own. (Gyles Turner, by the way, after
hisbank had made about the record smash and reconstruc-
tion in Australian history, had the insolence to heave
the brick of scorn at honest, well-meaning little Jimmy
Mirams and others, whose wrecks were a mere shadow
beside that of the Commercial.) And now Adams goes. His
great bank made a profit of £1450 last half-year. It doesn’t
judged by the profit figures, seem to recover worth a
cent. Fourteen years have passed since the date of the
Great Smash, and among the institutions which came
out crippled, and yet survived the wreck, the A.J.S.
presents about the most dispiriting balance-sheet. In
its gaudy days its one ambition seemed to be to be bigger
than the Commercial of Sydney, and it established
branches at incredible places like Boat Harbor, Guyra,
Lake Cudgellico, Menindie, and Oberon, and had 31
offices in Sydney and suburbs, and paid 15 per cent, divi-
dends, and put up much bloated and hollow gorgeous-
ness. Perhaps the A.J.S. Bank will recover under Mr,
Adams’ successor, as the Commercial of Australia and
Queensland National are doing under their new manage-
ment. I see that Mr. Adams retires a rich man. Well, if
he had put his money into the shares of his own bank he
might easily have retired a beggar. Apparently he
didn’t put his money into shares of his own bank, but
other people read the balance-sheets and did.

Another link with the days of the Great
Pro-Consul has passed over in the person of
“ Clutha ’’ Thomson. Mr. J. W. Thomson lived
to the ripe age of 78 in the wild, wet, windy
climate of Clinton, in Otago (M.L.). He replaced
“Rebel” Macandrew in the House of Reps., and
became Hori Grey's Minister for Lands. It was
he who wrecked the Stout-Vogel Ministry in
1884, and Governor Jervois sent for him to
form a Cabinet, but he. was too demo-
cratic for his .time, and could not get a
working majority. So Atkinson got a show,
only to be broken inside three days by a fresh
Stout-Vogel combination. To the best of
writer’s recollection, Thomson was defeated
only once, and that was when Tom
Mackenzie, a tremendously affluent Balclutha
storekeeper, allowed the whole country-side
to get into his debt, and then ran for Parlia-
ment. He was put in by cringing debtors, who
hoped Mack might wipe off the liability if they
worked conspicuously for him. But Mack didn't.
Next election Thomson was elected for Bruce,
and later on iregained his old seat, which he held
till the infirmities of age compelled him to retire
from political life. Personally, he was a fine old
gentleman, with an amazingly well-stored mind,
and a great affection for children.
J. H. Hinchcliffe, who had been dodging in
and out of the Australian “Inky Way’’for 40 years,
dodged out of it finally in Queensland a week or so
back. While employed on the railway at Man-
Chester he studied shorthand, being one of
Isaac Pitman’s early pupils. In 1858 he
became a newspaper reporter, and stuck to
that job for four years. Next he took a
hand at land surveying, and then moved to
Queensland (1863). He went “on the and ”
in the Logan district, and when he wasn’t
on the land he was surveying, and be-
tween the two he kept himself out of the
ink till 1865, when he joined the Bris-
bane Courier. After that he became a
cotton-buyer for three years, then he turned
cane-grower, and finally bent himself double
over the ink-pot again, first for the Darling
Downs Gazette, then as editor of the
newly-established Logan Witness, pub-
lished at Beenleigh. Later on he became
owner of it. After running it for 14
years, he closed it up, and soon after re-
tired to private life, and the study of
astrology, in Brisbane.
A Melb. newspaper par, last week, gravely
announced the death of a local Syrian person
(father of a Bourke-street hotelkeeper), at the age
of 101. Also, the grandfather of the deceased was
said to have achieved “ the exceedingly rare age
of 125 years.” If The Bulletin could accept
these figures as facts, it would welcome them as a
warning to white Australian girls. Never marry
a Syrian with the hope of being widowed. But
the statements re Mr. Abbotomy Michael, the
colored ancient in question, include the allegation
that he entered the Syrian army in 18G5 (when he
was 59), and “ led a strenuous and active life as a
soldier for 20 years’’ (till he was 79, that is).
Also, that “one of his earliest recollections was
the invasion of Syria by the Emperor Napoleon.”
It was in 1799, long before he was crowned
Emperor, that Napoleon Buonaparte invaded
Syria, and the late Mr. Abbotomy Michael, if he
died in 1907 at the age of 101, was obviously not
born till 1806. It is a wonder he didn’t remem-
ber Saladin.
The timely use of Chamberlain’s Cough
Remedy will prevent pneumonia.*
Varney Parkes, who, failing Carruthers’
nomination, is now splitting the Deform vote at
Canterbury (N.S.W.), was never quite pleased
with the conduct of any of his Parliamentary
leaders. He signed a requisition once asking
Reid to stand against father Parkes on the
ground that the old man had been at the head of
affairs long enough. At the same time Varney
had no doubt, he explained, but that Reid was a
lamentable clown. This candid-friend business
doesn’t make for popularity in politics.
Died recently, at Wellington (M.L.), aged
67, C. O. Montrose, at one time private secre-
tary to George Grey, the great Pro-Consul.
He served with the 40th Regiment in the Maori
war, and wrote several books on the campaign.
At one time he was sub-editor of the Maoriland
Herald, and subsequently editor of the Observer
and the Star (Auckland). He had the Crimean,
African and Maoriland war medals, and was
specially mentioned in despatches by General
Duncan Cameron, the commander who so notably
muddled the Brown Man’s war in Maoriland.
FIGHTING LARRY RENTOUL, MEL-
BOURNE PRESBYTERIAN PARSON.
A limited company, to be known as
Archer Bros., Limited, was recently registered
at Rockhampton (Q.). The names of the direc-
tors, with their addresses, are Colin Archer,
Larvik (Norway); James George Lewis Archer,
Larvik (Norway) : Robert Stubbs Archer, Grace-
mere (Q.): David Archer, Croydon (Eiig.);
William Archer, King’s Langley (Eng.); George
Lindsay Archer, Sydney (N.S.W.); and Edward
Walker Archer, Targinnie (Q.). Evidently the
habit of living out of the country where one’s
money is made runs in families, like the habit of
never having any children.
UNBENDING BENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Premier Bent did not go near to the tomb of Napoleon
in Paris, because, he says, it is so constructed that every-
one approaching it must bow, and he “ refused to bow io
anything: in Paris.”
Most grateful news for Melbourne ears—
Their splendid Tommy Bent,
Whom every bad man hates and fears,
When on the Continent
Would never deign to bow his head
To any creature, live or dead,
But went through Paree’s wicked brood,
A monument of rectitude.
He found their comic opera blue,
And coldly looked away ;
Their music halls were risque too—
He simply wouldn’t stay.
To poor Napoleon ’neath the sod
He scornfully refused a nod.
Now Brighton people must bequeath
To Tom another Judkin wreath,
Inscribed : “To Bent, whom foreign splendor
Could not beguile into a bender ! ”

Besides the year’s profit shown above, £10,781 was spent
on renewal of tramways ; another waj' to treat that would
be to include it as profit and then write it off. Of that
£10,781 revenue was charged direct with £7314, and the
other £3467 came out of the renewal reserve. The co.’s
reserves now stand as follows
1905. 1906. 1907.

But, in addition to its own reserves, it provides a sinking-
fund for the Tramway Trust. That Trust, consisting of
the Melbourne and suburban municipalities, raised
£1,650,000 to build the lines, and when it had built them
it handed them over to this co. The co, pays the interest,
provides a sinking fund (now £45,000 a year), and is to
hand the undertaking back on June 30,1916. The profits
shown above are in addition to this interest (£74,250) and
sinking fund.
The company’s own capital was originally
£250,000 ; but subsequently £230,000 of undivided profits
were capitalised. The capital actually in the undertak-
ing is about £2,050,000, of which £1,650,000 is the Trust’s,
and £400,000 the co.'s. On this the return was :
Profit as shown above £137,661
Sinking fund for Trust 45,000
Trust debenture interest 74,250
Total £256,911
Dess Interest on co.'s investments .. 25,598
Net revenue of undertaking.. .. £231,313
That means that the public pays £lO ss. 7d. per cent, on
the capital invested. That is one of the privileges of
getting Private Enterprise to work what the public has
pledged its own credit to provide.
It was mentioned just; now that the co. has
about £400,000 in the business. Its whole possessions
can be grouped in this way :

Surplus.. .. £740,847 £984,482 £1,050,815
To the total of £1,050,815 as at June 30 add £12,300 for
leaseholds, which probably run out before the under-
taking passes over; total £1,063,115, which is the amount
of the co.’s capital and reserves as shown above. The
“ other property” is mainly'ears, grips, etc. An interesting
luestion for the investor is: Will that and the freeholds
oring the price set against them in the balance-sheet?
They probably won’t intrinsically be worth so much ;
iut the investors who have been buying “Melbourne
Trams ” heavily the last 12 or 18 months argue that, as the
Trust won’t be able to electrify the lines in advance, it
will have to buy the co.’s stock to go on with, or permit
itself to be squeezed by the co. into some concession or
other. Five years ago this month the shares (960,000)
were worth 17s. They are now worth about 345. The co.
has nine years more to run. In the past six years it has
added, as shown above, £309,968 to its surplus of assets ;
if that goes on, it will have added another £464,952 by
June 30, 1916. Add that to the present surplus, and
there is £1,515,767, or £1 lls. 7d. per share—or 2s. sd. per
share less than the present price. This assumes, how-
ever (1) that the next nine years will be as profitable as
the past five ; and (2) that all the assets (equipment, etc.)
will realise 20s. in the £of present book value. And as
to the first supposition two things are worth considering
—that in the five years 1898-1902 the profit was only
£373,101 as against £582,146 in the past five years; and
that the sinking fund, which was only £33,000 till 1905,
is now £45,000. There is, however, an offset to the latter
increase of outgo : the return from the co.’s investments
is also increasing, without of course affecting the actual
tramway earnings. No doubt if £1 lls. 7d. can be re-
turned in 1916, and if the recent dividends can be main-
tained, the 345. can be justified: for at that price a
dividend of 24 per cent, on the actually paid capital is
equal to an investment return of a shade over 7 per cent.

The reserve fund apparently includes part of the provi-
sion to cover unexpired risks, and is not, therefore, all
true reserve, the premiums not yet having been fully
earned. It is true that the formal reserve fund (£2000)
is not this y’ear described as a reinsurance reserve; but
it is to all appearances the same reserve as was described
that way last year. The co. began very badly indeed,
paying an excessive dividend ; now it has got down nearer
the right thing, though it is very doubtful whether the
lay-by is even yet sufficient, in view of the microscopic
reserves. Still, in proportion to premiums (and therefore
presumably risks), the capital is large; so that the
policy-holders are as well protected as in most offices.
The net premiums were £10,071; capital and reserves,
after paying dividend, are £23,044, or 229 per cent, of the
premiums, and that is well above the average. The his-
tory of the co. is further set out here :

The lossrate is very heavy; the co., it is understood,
devotes its attention mostly to marine insurance, and it
has been a very bad time for marine underwriters lately,
both Australian and English. The expense rate is
moderate (marine insurance is in that respect, anyway,
less costly than the pursuit of the 10s. fire premium), and
the securities are of a first-class character.

So that is what the reduction of the old Queensland
State duties has ended in, so far as this co. is concerned —
the loss of one half the capital; while the other half
isn’t able to earn anything, and, unless a better tariff is
adopted, that half is as good as lost too. Under the
State tariff the co. had done fairly well ; though certainly
during the drought and depression it did not feel justified
in paying any dividends. But it put up with
Queensland industries mostly had to. In the past few
years of great prosperity it ought, however, to have
shown substantial profits to make up in part for those
lean years ; instead, thanks to G. Reid and Cook and the
Freetrade misrepresentatives of Queensland, it made very
heavy losses. In the hope that Australia would have
more sense when it saw the effect of its tariff-
lowering, this co. has kept its mill open and dis-
tributed about £12,000 a year in wages, salaries, etc.,
and put up with an annual loss of about £2500. If it
could largely increase its output—in other words, if a
market were for a while secured for it—it could, the
directors say, work at a very great advantage compared
with what it can do now ; but to do that requires more
capital; and unless it gets a tariff vastly different from
what it has had, who is likely to be fool enough to put
more capital into a concern which in a few years has lost
half of what it had ? If it could get that tariff, and could
then get the extra capital it needs (and it would then
have a fair chance of getting it), though the cost might
go up for a while, the promised advantages to be derived
from working on a larger and freer scale are so
great that prices would very soon come down
again. One current opinion is that it is absurd to
put a high duty on tweeds, blankets, and other
woollens because the Australian works now are
going “ all they know,” and can’t cope with a bigger de-
mand. The fact, is that the works Want to expand, and
under the old tariff can’t, because they can’t get the
money ; so they potter along in a small, cramped way,
buying from hand to mouth, paying through the nose for
everything, yet, in spite of all, turning out goods that
they can well be proud of. It is quite true that for a few
months they may not be able to cope with all the de-
mand ; but secure them the market and they soon will.
If that isn’t done, then this co. and many more may as
well give the thing best. That will mean sacking all
hands and losing the rest of the capital; but without a
high tariff the time won’t be long when all hands will
have to be sacked, ar.d all the rest of the capital will be
definitely lost, anyway.

For many years this co. paid 10 per cent, dividend, but it
is pretty obvious that it did it at the expense of capital.
Now, though 10 per cent, is again paid, 4 per cent, of it
is described as bonus, which is probably the directors’
way of hinting that they are in no way committed to
more than 6 per cent, as a general thing. The progress
of the co. recently is further illustrated by this :

After providing for the half-year’s dividend, there re-
mained a surplus on Dec., 1906, of £29,130 ; so that during,
the past half-year the position, so far as liquid assets is
concerned, has improved by £3071; the other £4475, to
make up the total profit of £7546, has gone into additions
to works. Apart from current expenditure on renewals,
nothing appears, therefore, to have been provided for
depreciation except the sums added to reserves ; and
that being so, the reserves are not true reserves, and the
profits shown above are not true profits, unless
the patched and renewed plant was worth as
much at the end of the half-year as it was
at the beginning. The directors propose to add £2OOO to
depreciation fund out of the profits ; but whether that
represents their estimate of the half-year’s depreciation
they do not say. If it does, then, of course, the true
profits come down to £5546. Besides the depreciation
fund (now £15,141) there is a renewal fund (£8864) ; pre-
sumably that is also a provision for depreciation. Under
these circumstances, it has to be remembered that, pro-
fitable though the business is, the balance-sheet figures
are inflated, and that, later on, there will have to be
another re-valuation, and such another writing-off (of
reserves, that is—not necessarily again of capital) as there
was three years ago.

This is one of the few Australian industrial concerns that
show consistently good results. It got a good start
under the old Victorian State tariff. Moreover, the Vic-
torian wholesale softgoods man, though he had started
as an importer, soon recognised that Protection had come
to stay; wherefore, instead of importing hats from
France and Belgium and other foreign parts, he accepted
the inevitable, and started importing them from Colling-
wood. In fact, he turned partly into a manufacturer
himself; and that is how this co. comes to have had a
career almost unique among Australian manufacturing
enterprises. Also that is why the ledger debts are stated
gross, “no provision for bad or doubtful debts being
necessary ” —which has also contributed to the success.
The profit is shown above as “ net.” That means that
something is written off for wear and tear of machinery,
etc.—£sso, or about 12J p.c. last year. But the freeholds
and factory buildings remain in the books at the 1903
valuation.

This leaves the net profit for the year £1292, which is a
bare 4 per cent, on capital and reserves combined ; and
the slight improvement, which is apparently due to the
prosperous times and the larger buying power of the
people, has been seized upon to put up the dividend
again to a very moderate 4 per cent., in spite of the fact
that for the previous two years, when only 3 per cent,
was paid, nothing was apparently provided out of profits
to cover wear and tear of plant. Also, in order to in-
crease the profit, shareholders have had to take on some
further liabilities, with their attendant risks ; there are
debentures now for £4500 as against £2900 twelve
months ago ; though, certainly other debts have been re-
duced from £7464 to £7174. This little co. is paying
away now about £11,500 a year in wages, freights and
incidental expenses, and about an equal amount for
wool ; and a shade more Protection will give it the com-
mand of a market big enough to make even those ser-
viceable figures look very small.

The improvement is probably largely due to a smaller
provision for bad debts. In the Jan.-June half of 1906
“salaries, expenses, bad debts, etc.,” ran to £6164; the
gross profit (working account) on sales was £12,563. Now
the gross profit on sales is only £11,938 ; but the lumped
expenses are down to £s624—and, as remarked just now,
that severe shrinkage is probably due to smaller provision
for bad debts. Also “Repairs to houses” has been a
smaller item. Therefore, much importance cannot be
attached to the improvement in the profits as disclosed ;
the business, in fact, shows no actual improvement.
Whether anything is being written off freeholds is uncer-
tain ; there certainly has been a slight shrinkage in their
book value:—

Twelve months ago freeholds stood at £186,946 ; but there
have been sales of land since then—the co. has a fine
estate, which it announced some time ago it would
gradually dispose of. The debts are heavy ; therefore,
the payment of a dividend which absorbs almost the
entire profits is a very risky policy. If nothing is written
off properties beyond the small amount shown, the policy
is especially risky.

This society faced the situation boldly, and wrote down
properties so resolutely that mostly a surplus is shown
over and above the revised book value. Its present
reserves consist of a formal reserve fund, of £12,000, un-
divided profit £1521, and a contingency fund (£5163) set
aside to cover possible losses on properties in possession
or sold on terms. It is out of this fund that the amounts
shown above as written off have come. The extent of
the business, and to some extent the need for this re-
serve, are shown by these figures (the first column refers
to the period immediately following the cleaning-up) :

Though the deposits and other debts have grown a little
in the past 12 months they are still very moderate com-
pared with capital and reserves. Good progress has been
made in clearing out the foreclosed properties ; and what
are left are giving a net return of very nearly 6 per cent.,
so that evidently it is not the unprofitable sediment that
is left in the society’s hands. Altogether the Standard
looks to be nowadays a very prudently managed concern.

This is one of the Gas cos. which give shareholders and
the public just as little information as they can in their
published accounts. Only N. S. Wales Gas cos., as a
rule, adopt this practice ; you may not know whether
the Victorian and Queensland cos. are providing enough
out of revenue to cover wear and tear and pay for
renewals ; but, at a,ny rate, you know how much they are
providing. Practically all the N. S. Wales Gas cos. are,
however, tarred out of the same pot; they may be making
a great deal more than they say they are, and “ socking”
away in works the profit that they don’t show ; or they
may be showing practically all the surplus of revenue over
working expenses as profit, and providing nothing to re-
place the plant, etc., that is gradually wearing out. This
co.’s alleged profit and loss account consists of the one
solitary item —“Net profit on sales of gas, etc. (after
allowing for reserve and depreciation), £5997.” The
amount put to reserve is £3OOO : what other amount is
put aside to cover depreciation there is no way of finding
out. Whatever it is, some of it has no doubt been
spent on extensions of mains, etc. Six months ago
this item stood at £184,535 ; it now stands at
£184,195. That looks as though £340 has been written
off. But meantime if £5OO has been spent on extensions,
it would mean (supposing there have been no sales of
mains and plant) that £B4O has been written off out of
Erofits. Six months ago the co.’s debts (including that
alf-year’s dividend) totalled £35,387; they now total
£26,607, so that debts have been reduced by £B7BO in
six months. The assets apart from land, mains, and
machinery were six months ago £26,398; they are now
£28,068, a growth of £1670. Add the- £B7BO and £1670
together, and we get the improvement in what may be
called the cash position in the six months—£lo,4so. Of
that £l2 is capital got in. Thus £10,438 plus anything
spent on extensions, and paid for out of revenue, is the
total excess of revenue over working expenses. The
alleged net profit of £5997 may therefore be taken with
a grain of salt—or a spoonful, if a grain isn’t enough to
swallow the yarn with.

During the past half-year £4424 of new capital has been
got in at a small premium ; this new capital carries divi-
dend as from April 1. Though £9OO has been “ trans-
ferred to wear and tear account,” that account has been
reduced by £B97—apparently money spent on renewals
and repairs—so that it is only £3 ahead on the year. The
“plant and buildings of every description in action”
are set down at c05t—£32,419. On the other
side is a reserve for depreciation of plant,
£6458. That is practically, therefore, a reserve
for extraordinary renewals : it is a set-off against the
wear and tear which isn’t yet quite bad enough wear and
tear to call for the workman’s hammer or the scrap-heap.
It is, therefore, by no means the best sort of reserve ; it
isn’t something the co. owns above and beyond its capital
—it is rather that part of the capital that is represented
in the works by rust and worms. The new issue of
capital has improved the cash position. Before that it
was weak, because, for one thing, all the reserves are sunk
in plant, etc. At June 30 there were cash balances
amounting to £3044 ; the half-j-ear’s dividend had to
come out of that. And as the co. is extending its works,
the balance will probably soon be absorbed. In spite of
the extension, profits are not what they were in the pre-
vious year ; and, as reserves have to be drawn on to pay
the dividend, it looks as though a mistake were made in
putting it up to 7 per cent.

The capital is £42,000 ; so that, comparatively speaking,
the reserves are pretty substantial. It does not, how-
ever, appear as though anything has been systematically
written off plant; all that is done is to pay for repairs
out of revenue. Therefore anything extra in the way of
renewals would either have to come out of reserves, or
the dividend would have to be modified. The cash posi-
tion is, however, easy ; after paying dividend and debts,
there will be just over £4300 of liquid assets ; so that,
while business keeps up, the dividend isn’t in much
jeopardy. The accounts are presented in a very clear
and complete manner.

Something is written off to cover depreciation, but the
amount is not disclosed. At June, 1902, the plant invest-
ment was £12,986 ; it is now £12,427 ; so, presuming no
sales of p ant have been made, all additions made during
the past five years have been paid for out of profits, and
a further provision of £559 (in addition to the reserves
shown above) has been made for decay. It is a highly
profitable business. The capital is £10,000; and the
liquid assets, after paying current dividend, exceed the
liabilities by £6997. Five years ago the surplus was
£3BBB. Meantime a 15 per cent, dividend has been paid.
Very few gas cos. in N. 8. Wales or anywhere else are on a
better wicket than that.

This is the co. that went on paying big di vs. for years and
forgot to lay by any revenue to provide for plant re-
newals, until the electric light part of the undertaking
collapsed. Then the ordinary share div. had to be cut
down to 1J per cent. (2| per cent, paid every other half-
year), the surplus being used to write off plant. The
electric-light plant, mains and fittings are still in the books
for £9264 ; yet that part of the business resulted in a
loss last half-year of £lB. The surplus profits, written
off, are being' applied to wiping out a debenture debt,
which has been reduced from £25,000 at the end of 1903
to £17,000 now. The co. has still a good deal of worn-out
and wrongly-distributed capital to replace; but it is
making very fair progress.

The profit is shown, it is said, “ after providing for de-
preciation and a proportion of the cost of the renewal of
mains and services.” The mains, services, buildings,
etc., were down at £11,864 six months ago. They
are down for the same £11,864 now. Something
may, of course, have been written off ; for extensions;
(as distinguished from renewals) may have been
paid for out of revenue, and that would be equivalent to'
writing-down the balance. But the balance-sheet shows-
as an asset “new mains account, £318” ; and that and a
vague remark in the report suggest that not even re-
newals have been wholly paid for out of revenue. If
that is so, the position, put plainly, is like this : the co.
has worn out its mains (that is, it has used up its capi-
tal), and now it is charging renewals to capital also.-


MINE MANAGER.
APPLICATIONS will be received by the undersigned
at 375 Collins Street, Melbourne, up to 5 p.m. on
Friday, 23rd August, 1907, from persons competent to fill
the position of MINE MANAGER of THE DUCHESS MINE,
near Clonpurry, North Queensland. Applicants must
submit testimonials, and state age, experience and salary
required. A liberal salary to a competent man.
By Order of the Board,
EDWARD H. SHAOKELL, Secretary,
The Hampden Cloncurry Copper Mines, Limited.
If these new mains are renewals, the only honest thing to
do is to write off reserves to that extent. Also, if other
mains and services have depreciated, though they haven’t
yet depreciated enough to require renewal, it would be
an honest thing to write off a further amount equal to
the depreciation. If there are not enough reserves to
provide for that depreciation, then it will be obvious that
some of the capital has gone; which means that it has
been paid away in dividends. The chances are that a
good many Australian gas and electric-light companies
are in that position, and it is only a question of time
when the unpleasant fact will have to be faced. In Queens-
land the Rockhampton co. is in that street already.
Shareholders in these cos. have been content^ with the
most absurdly inadequate particulars concerning their
own property ; and if they fall in as a consequence, they
will only have themselves to blame.

“0.K.”: It is a fact that the Union Bank in
Sydney, some three months ago, received some scrip
from Munroe and Munroe, of New York, for distribution
among the local purchasers of shares in the Marconi
Wireless Telegraph Co. of Canada. The few people whose
names appeared on the scrip have duly collected it, no
doubt; and now the other persons, who placed their cash
and confidence with Horace G. Robinson, would like to
know what method of allotment was adopted by his
principals, Munroe and Munroe. Many thousands of
shares were subscribed for in Melbourne ere Robinson
moved along to Sydney; yet the Union Bank in Mel-
bourne can give ho satisfaction to local enquirers. How
comes it that the vouchers of a few Sydney investors
have been exchanged for scrip, whilst the earlier inves-
tors are left unsatisfied ?

In addition £703 net has been added to the fire and acci-
dent insurance fund, which now amounts to £6066 and is
not included in the reserves set out above ; also £1145
spent on the new shaft has been treated as ordinary ex-
penditure. (The co. charges it to capital account, and
then writes the amount off.) The dividends for the half-
year were at the rate of 99 per cent, per annum on paid
capital (£161,576). As a former honest old S. Australian
Leg. Councillor once said, when he came to his peroration
on a new bill—“ That lily don’t want no paint.”
The past, however, is only of much practical
value so far as it is a guide to the future ; and what about
that? Lead has averaged £l9 17s. Id. during the half-
year, the directors report. The lead in the concentrates
totalled 11,118 tons. Silver averaged 2s. 9 9-16 d. ; there
were 276,322 oz. of that metal in the concentrates. Of the
profit £9583 came from payments made by the Zinc
Corporation on account of old tailings. Deduct that first,
and £93,798 remains. Then we can get these variations,
assuming metals to average the prices mentioned here-
under :
Lead. Silver. Profit. Per Share.
£l9 17 1 .. 2-9 9-16 .. £93,798 .. £0 9 4
17 17 1 .. 2-9 9-16 .. 71,562 .. 0 7 2

15 0 0 .. 2-6 .. 35,765 .. 0 3 6
13 0 0 .. 2-6 .. 13,529 .. 0 1 4
That is the profit per half-year without deductions for
wear and tear, but on the other side without allowances
for zinc material, which mayor may not be valuable in
the future. Also, of course, it is on the basis of the past
half-year’s production at the past half-year’s costs,
which were a little higher than usual on account
of heavy development expenditure. What the metal
markets are going to be in the future nobody
knows. But in the past 10 years lead in only five years
averaged more than the £l3 quoted above as a minimum,
and in the 10 years before that it only averaged £l3 or
upwards in three years. And the average for silver for
many years past has been slightly under 2s. 6d.
The B. H. South’s ore reserves are now esti-
mated at 3,000,000 tons ; but the figures are probably
only a rough approximation. The past half-year’s ex-
traction was 101,385 tons; so, at that rate, there is
nearly 15 years’ work in the mine down to the 970 ft. level;
and at the 970 ft. level the ore is proved for a length of
1000 ft., and the test crosscuts give it an average width
of 117 ft., and an assay value of 13 per cent, lead, 7£oz.
silver and 11-8 per ceiit. zinc. The average value of the
ore mined during the past half-year was 15 - 2 per cent.
lead, 5 - 2 oz. silver, and 12T per cent, zinc ; practically all
this came from above 825 ft. The ore at the deep level is
therefore poorer in lead but richer in silver. A mine with
15 years’ore above 970 ft., and with a lode 1000 ft. long
and 117 ft. wide going underfoot at that level, has no need
to worry about ore supply so far as quantity goes. But
the metal markets make all the difference.

British Broken Hill expects its Thompson shaft
workings to hatch something worth sending to market,
and the chances so far are favorable. The mystery of the
ore cut in sinking the shaft below the 300 ft. level has not
yet been cleared up, for the water came in and the men
went out, and the guessing competition as to whether
the ore is an isolated bunch, a small seam, or the top of
a big shoot still goes on. Marsh’s 600 ft. north drive, which
was to have cut the lode coming down from the 500 ft., has
been hung up for over a week owing to the inadequacy
of the winding engine, which led to the waste accumu-
mulating in the drive. This drive is now in about 200 ft.,
and no ore, except a small seam (indignantly declared to
have no connection with the sought-for lode), has yet
been cut.
• *• * *
The North Broken Hill is trying to pick up a
continuation of its 800 ft. ore body, dipping north.
Present course of the lode would carry it to the east of the
Victoria shaft, where there are hopes that it will be
found some distance below the 800 ft. The North is look-
ing very well underground just now.

The De Bavay zinc-extraction plant on the
North Broken Hill dump has been closed down to allow
of some material alterations. This appears to be the fate
of all the zinc extraction plants erected to treat purchased
tailings. The Gillies plant is now an empty shell of gal-
vanised iron, surrounded by piles of dismantled pans and
other condemned machinery. An entirely new plant is
being installed.

Oobar North (N.S.W.) is the neighbor of the
big mine. Much work has been done in sinking and cross-
cutting from several shafts ; No. 3 is the most likely, and
it is proposed to deepen it to 1250 ft. to try to pick up the
Cobar lode now. being worked about 600 ft. away. It
doesn’t seem far ; yet the Great Cobar Co. has been
working for years and hasn’t got nearer than 300 ft. to
the northern boundary. There is some excitement round
Cobar because copper carbonates have been found east of
the big mine. Cobar, like Cloncurry, should have got
used to discoveries of showy carbonate ore by this time.

The “ good thing ” that it was reported a couple
of months ago might happen to the North Bulli Coal Co.
has happened, and shares have sprung from about 13s. 6d.
to 235. 6d. The good thing turns out to be an increase of
capital by the issue of 75,000 new £1 shares, of which the
big Adelaide Steamship Co. is alleged to have taken
50,000 at par, while the rest have gone towards clearing
off debentures. The available new shares didn’t quite
get rid of the debentures ; about £20,000 of the new
capital has also to go that way. The North Bulli hasn’t
been in the coal combine, and has been handicapped that
way ; but if the Adelaide S. S. Co., which is a big coal-
user and retailer, takes a kindly interest in it, it will be
on a very good wicket, nevertheless. One weak point
about it is that another co. owns the freehold ; it is only
a leaseholder itself. •

A smart Victorian crowd took it into their
heads not long since that Mount Lyells were not stand-
ing up well enough in the market. So they started to
buttress them, but didn't reckon on the metal market.
Copper is, however, down over £3O a ton already. No
low-grade show like the Lyell is able to stand up against
trouble of that sort, and go on smiling. The little share
move, too, was not helped by a journalist in London, who
shot out an estimate of the strength of the Lyell reserves.
So, between one thing and another, Lyells have fallen
from over 50s. to about 30s.—a shrinkage of a million in
market value. Then, as the price of metal has eased £3O
a ton, there is a shrinkage of income of £234,000, on the
basis of last half-year's output. As Lyell ore itself is
down to o’6o per cent., work would have to be stopped if
that average material alone had to be handled. Fortu-
nately, North Lyell carries 5'35 per cent, copper, and in
the proportion used, the two, plus the metal-bearing flux,
pan outat about 2 percent. Last half-year, the profit was
£282,938, and metal averaged £lO6 9s. 3d. The copper
produced was 3796 tons ; that works out at £74 10s. Sd.
per ton. The metal is now bobbing about between £76
and £79 ; so, on last half-year’s basis, there is precious
little profit left—working, that is, as the co. worked
last half-year. Of course, the North ore is richer.
That ore is used, roughly, at the rate of 125,000 tons a
year, and there is proved three j'ears’ supply on that
scale. Even taking divs. at the same rate as last half-
year—ls. 3d. and a bonus of 2s.—the present market gives
five years’ life to the mine. But the existing price of
copper won’t permit of such a bonus. So a man has to
be possessed of great faith in the mining unseen to buy
now. It required even more faith to buy a few months
ago, yet many did so. North Lyell, too, has had the
experience of nearly all other mines; the ore does not
improve in value with depth—a little factor that may
upset more pots than one when the next levelis opened.

Briseis and New Brothers Home No. 1 (Tas.)
are present-day tin-mining anxieties. To the mind of the
average man outside Brothers Home No. 1, the high reef
struck in the bend of the lead means a short life for the
claim. The rock is granite, and shelves slowly. Derby does
not doubt that the gutter has gone beyond the
boundary into the Briseis. Does it make back again?-
that is the delicate little problem that the proposed
boring will settle. Is it too much to ask whether Briseis
Clark has put down any bores to find how the land lies in
his claim? He is such a pleasant man that, even if he
had, he wouldn’t wound Joske’s feelings by saying so.
Still Bowes Kelly might be let into the secret, if there is
one. The worst is that Kelly is the sort of Irishman that
doesn’t pass things like that on ; so no one is quite sure
how the cat has jumped. Clark may want one of Bowes
Kelly’s winks to induce him to start. If that has not
been given, it is time it was, because it is as momentous
to Briseis as to Brothers Home that the gutter should not
narrow. Given a contraction and 50p.c. can be written
off the life of both claims. In the meantime, while some-
one is fiddling, a lot of rats are scuttling.

According to the annual report, the cost of pro-
ducing copper from ore at the Wallaroo and Moonta(S.A.)
last year was £72 11s. per ton ; the metal leached out of
the old dumps was got for less, but there is no great quan-
tity of that. If those are normal figures, then Wallaroos
look pretty sick at even the present price of copper. But
it has to be remembered that for some time past this co.
has been fighting over the question of what constitutes
profit—that is to say, on what basis income-tax ought to
be assessed. Taking earlier reports and balance-sheets,
the income-tax people claimed (and the S.A. Supreme
Court has since unwisely supported them) that certain
wear and tear deductions may not be made. It is at
least probable, therefore, that last year the co. “got
back ” by doing a quantity of renewal and replacement
work, arid charged it up to ordinary working account.
Anyhow, mining, concentrating, and smelting costs,
which were only £55 14s. in 1904, jumped as high as
£7l 6s. 7d. in 1906. Probably, even now, figures could be
reduced to £56. The output is between 7000 and 8000 tons
a year, and the metal (fine) is worth about £3 per ton
above standard quotations. There are 160,000 shares in
the co. ; so it requires £2O a ton profit on an output of
8000 tons to pay £1 per share. But he is a sanguine man
who looks for a steady £76 for copper. For 25 years
past the average has been well under £6O.

Eaglehawk Consolidated, Maldon (Vic.), has
come to a full stop as a dividend-payer, not through dear
work, but for want of gold. Costs are under 7dwt. This
is good for Maldon, where light stamps and roundabout
methods are the rule. The co. has a nest-egg in cash of
about £6500, but it has less than a half-year’s good ore in
sight above 950 ft. Shaft-sinking has to be faced, with
the same hunt after golden stone that is taking place at
the South German, though the outlook is not quite so
dreary as it is there. The best about the Eaglehawk
Board is that it works and doesn’t talk.

Ballarat Sebastopol Plateau mining has shrunk
back to where it would have stuck if Sewell and Bent
had not fraternised to the tune of £5OOO for the sinking
of the South Star shaft. Ballarat East therefore holds
the district’s belt to-day. This is where the royalty king
rules in happy affluence, and where the tributor struggles
for bread. An instructive list shows how these so-called
hard-up claims have profited by a system of mining that
ought to be wiped out even more drastically than the
royalty evil. North Woah Hawp, on a paid-up capital of
7s. per share, has declared divs. of 335. 6d. ; Last
Chance, paid up 255., divs. 365. ; Victoria United, paid
up Bs., divs. 16s. 6d. ; Llanberris No. 1, paid up 215.,
divs. 255. ; New Normanby, paid up 16s. 10d., divs. 20s.

Visick, one time of the Prentice and Southern,
has returned to Rutherglen to manage the Chiltern
Valley Consols, after having tried to make a do of that
Tasmanian tin waster, the Briseis Extended. He is
punching out nearly 13dwt. wash at the Consols, and
would make ends meet had the mine not lacked
development. The claim was for a long time run on penny
calls, and was scoffed at as the outsider of the district.
Doubts existed whether the Chiltern Valley lead ran into
the claim at all; and boring hasn’t proved it so far.
Visick knows Chiltern of old, and he speaks with the cer-
tainty of the veteran declaring that the co. has 5000 ft. of
the gutter to work. “ In my opinion, your company’s
lead is one of the best in the district.... From the present
line of blocking to your southern boundary is about
5000 ft., and I believe the lead will be found to traverse
the whole distance In conclusion, I feel confident that
with both ends opened up, your mine will be one of the
largest gold producers and dividend payers in the
district.” Yet there are dead shares in the co. This fact
makes us ask whether Visick has ever been confident
before.

There is a wealth of detail about the reports of
the Gordon Gold Mines, Gordon (Vic.), that you don’t
often get from the no-liability concern. Mine manager
John Walker’s report is that 200 ft. of driving north
should cut shoots of stone “ worked to water level, and
which I am informed on reliable authority yielded up to
12oz. and 16oz. to the ton.” How much 12oz. to 16oz. dirt
did the old-time miner ever leave behind, or, if you like,
ahead? The Board doesn’t look to 12oz. dirt, though ;
it expects, instead, to work, “ 26ft. of 4dwt. stone.”
Already the co. has got a surprise, hitting on a body
of quartz, 60 tons of which gaye 58oz. This is not
at all bad, and the work being done at the mine is cheap ;
and, of course, it needs to be if, apart from little
accidents like this strike of ounce quartz, it has to rely
upon 4dwt. “ tack.”

New Dempsey’s, Gaffney’s Creek (Vic.), is up
to full value at 20s. on the short shoot of stone that it
has at present. The winze from the top level was stopped
when only 19ft. deep, because the gold was going out at
one side of it; they are now in a new winze further
ahead, so as to cut the shoot again at a point where they
may be able to take it down 40ft. or 50ft. before it goes
out again. Though the shoot is estimated to be worth
from 2oz. to 30z., still it must be short when a winze
19ft. deep will go through it diagonally.

Victor’s Quartz, Wood’s Point (Vic.), is still in

The Three Jacks, Stawell (Vic.), wnich has
been suffering from nervous prostration for some time,
because certain people in England haven’t felt inclined to
put up more cash, has had a clean-up from its new
cyanide plant. Rumor—the only person who locally
knows anything about the Three Jacks—loudly asserts
that the clean-up totalled about 3oz. from 300 tons, which,
if true, should give a shock to the people at the far end
of the cable. Anyway, the plant has, without undue
ostentation, closed itself down.

The Bulletin had a suspicion that the Boulder
Perseverance’s whoop about its low working costs was
not justified, and the suspicion is deepening. In the old
days, when only “ounces” were sought after, a lot of
the stuff broken down was left behind in the stopes ;
while residues from the old incompetent treatment plant
were dumped underground to keep the sands company.
Latterly the ore sent to the mill has been leavened with
a lot of this filling; and as it can be dug out for very
little, costs have benefited considerably. By and by the
stopes will be emptied of their contents, and costs
will go up. Then shareholders will be treated to some
other yarn.

The recent fall in Kalgurlis (W.A.) is probably
due to poorer values in the bottom. All the newspaper
explanations try to cloak this speck on the mine’s pro-
spects, and rush on to tell of this or that face being
streaked with rich telluride. Shares, however, do not
drop from £l2 to £8 just for exercise. There is a reason
for such a fall, but probably “ the time is not yet ripe ” to
let the general body of shareholders into the know.

First clean-up from the Gwalia South mill
(W.A.) will take place at the end of August. The co.
started crushing with about £4OOO to the bad, but the
first two months’ profits are expected to wipe off this
debt. It is estimated that further development will
show that the mine has enough ore down to 600 ft. (where
the shoot passes into the Sons of Gwalia) to pay the
present market value of its shares in dividends, and also
allow' sufficient for redemption of capital. But the esti-
mates are based on guesswork.
» * # *
The Golden Pole (W.A.) lingers on. Values are
principally confined to a small, erratic shoot whose twist-
ings and turnings give the management no end of trouble.
If two or three thousand tons of picked stone were taken
out, it would leave the mine as bare of pay ore as Mother
Hubbard’s cupboard was of hones; but as the use of
rock drills necessitates breaking down more than treble
the width of the reef, the w'hole lot is sent to the mill. It
is on this basis that the tonnage of ore reserves is sup-
posed to be reckoned. Half-monthly progress reports
issued by the management still read w’ell; but as the
mine seems to go from bad to worse in depth, the end of
profitable mining cannot be very far off.

“Cover” dupes got a nasty wrench over the
fall in Lancefields to Ss. The difficulty at this mine still
rests with the treatment, but that is only temporary.
The mine is all right, and, some day, the shares will be,
too. It will take time, however, to clear off liabilities
and put the property on a profit-earning basis.

The report of the Boulder No. 1 for 1906 states
that the year’s work resulted in a profit and loss debit of
£1147, battery earnings having been small, on account of
ore-supply for crushing having practically ceased. The
management speaks -well of prospects in the north-east
corner of the Kalgoorlie lease, but points out that a suf-
ficient length of ore has not yet been exposed to justify
the co. resuming operations, and recommends that the
tributors be left in possession for the time being. The
fact that the extension of the Ivanhoe east lode, now
being driven on at 1500 ft. in the adjoining Boulder block,
has a decided tendency to pitch north, is also noted, and
hopes are entertained of the shoot continuing into Boul-
der No. 1 ground at depth. A short reference is made
to the co.’s newly-acquired St. George leases at Magnet,
where, according to the management, the ore to
the 90ft. level will give enough profit to pay the purchase
money and provide the necessary treatment plant.

Every steamer going Nor’-west from Fremantle
is crowded with miners for the tin and copper fields
between the coast and Marble Bar. Prospectors recently
dow r n in Perth from Roebourne, Port Hedland, and other
places, assert that copper has been found over a stretch
of country 250 miles long. A Bill authorising the long-
talked-of railway from Port Hedland to Marble Bar—
about 100 miles—has just been introduced : and, provided
the boodle can be raised, a couple of years should see its
completion. A lot of men are profitably employed tin-
mining at Wodgina, and it is proposed to deviate the
Marble Bar line to that district. The pick of the
Wodgina properties, embraced in the Mount Cassiterite
group, were offered to the William Knox crowd in Mel-
bourne, but no business eventuated. Port Hedland,
which has already four pubs, is a mere collection of gal-
vanised-iron shanties huddled together on loose white
sand bordered by mangrove swamps, and with a teeming
population of sandflies and mosquitoes.

Gregory Hills (W. A.), where Whitford’s Reward
original leases are situate, is a dead letter. The Whitford
co. sold its plant, tools, etc., to the State Government,
and the Government loaned them to prospector Mergher,
who, with his mate, Duplock, discovered the Green and
Gold, the rich-looking surface show of the Hills. At 15ft.
the gold cut out in the shaft; but sinking was continued
to 39ft., when the reef pinched to nothing. The place is
now abandoned. Whitford’s two 14 x 5 prospecting shafts
and Bob True’s gravestone are all that is left of another
W.A. boom.

Erliston and North Erliston districts, north of
Laverton (W.A.), are also on their last legs. There are
eight complete milling plants (53 head of stamps, all told),

chance of a revival either, for prospectors are giving a
wide berth to such a patchy field.

Mt. Molloy (Q.) has fallen into disfavor because
it hasn’t found much ore at the 370 ft. level; it was a long
time, too, before ore was found at the level above, and
the shoot there has not been developed for more than
180 ft. Some of the- faces are looking well, and the
shallow ground may be expected to produce a lot of good
ore yet. Bridges have been built along the proposed
tramline, so presumably the directors consider the show
has some claim to permanency. Still they don’t always
know. Mt. Garnet, for instance, got a railway.

The battery at the Mount Usher, near Rock-
hampton (Q.), is being removed to Emuford, in the
Walsh and Tinaroo district. Mt. Usher is another in-
stance of the awful hash J. Bull makes with a fair, but
not mammoth, mine, and an over-sized battery. “ Then,
gentlemen,” the chairman used to say to Mt. Usher
shareholders in far-away London, “there is the Golden
Cave, from which has been extracted the splendid total
of so many hundred ounces. Can it be said that a com-
pany with a property including such an item as the
Golden Cave ought to feel despondent?” And various
retired colonels would enthusiastically shout, “ Hear,
hear,” and the usual vote of thanks would follow. The
fact that the wonderful Golden Cave was a very blank
cavity was somehow or other overlooked. The amount
of cash J. Bull has spent in acquiring cavities that at one
time contained a certain amount of gold is something
appalling.

“ Rataroa ” : The Talisman, Karangahake
(M.L.), is in Bewick-Moreing’s stable, and is con-
spicuous among M.L. mines for publishing every month
detailed accounts of expenditure, including development
and office costs. Its directors, however, on the re-forma-
tion some years ago, fixed up an agreement eminently
satisfactory to themselves, by which they draw £lOOO a
year and 5 per cent, on all divs. up to £60,000. This per-
centage they have drawn for the last two years. As
220,000 out of the 300,000 shares are held in Maoriland, it
struck the Maoriland shareholders that they were fairly
entitled to a representative on the Board of five. They
nominated an attorney and a committee in England, and
forwarded their proxies accordingly, in the expectation
that the annual meeting would not be held till June 25,
the earliest date as yet. The English Board, however,
evidently smelt something coming, called the meeting
for May 30, refused to postpone, and threw out nomina-
tions and proxies as informal. When it is remembered
that the Talisman directors drew £4OOO last year on a
dividend payment of £60,000, while the Waihi directors
drew only £2400, and the Bank of New Zealand crowd
only £l6OO, comment is superfluous.

The Aerial Tramways which have been erected
for the British and Sulphide Corporation (Central) Mines
at Broken Hill are fine examples of present-day skill and
technical knowledge. The Mines will effect considerable
saving by means of these Aerialways as compared with
any other known mechanical contrivance for handling
ores on a large scale. The British Mine will economise
to over 2s. per ton. These two plants have already been
subjected to severe tests, and have amply demonstrated
their worth and ability. Both Aerialways were supplied

After conducting exhaustive tests in the con-
centration of the ores at the Broken Hill South mine, the
manager, Mr. Wainwright, has finally decided to instal
the Wilflev type of table, modified in the direction best
adapted to his particular local requirements. The great
advantage with this type of table is that it admits of so
many slight variations which adapt it to meet all classes
of pulverised ores. Provided the pulp for treatment is
graded it can be used to treat all varieties of ore from
slimes up to coarse grades. When treating slimes and
lightly mineralised ores, care must be taken to have the
slope of the table accurate, and a fine, smooth dressing
surface beyond the feather edged diagonal termination of
the riffles. When treating coarsely ground ores or ores
heavily charged with mineral, as at the Broken Hill South,
the riffles or grooves can be carried further along the table
and in some instances right up to the concentrates dis-
charge end. Mr. Wainwright ordered six tables as an
experiment, with fewer riffles or grooves than customary,
and with some of them —the lower ones—carried to the
extreme end of the table. So successful has this type of
Wilfley table proved that he has ordered 50 more from
the Austral Otis Engineering Company. This seme firm
has been placing several of the patent Callow Screens at
Broken Hill and elsewhere. This ingenious and simple
mechanism has solved the problem of grading prior to
concentration.*

POLITICAL
POINTS
The salaries of Federal members have
now been raised to £6OO a year. It isn’t enough
—£looo a year would be a fair price for the sort
of intellect that the country wants to buy—but it
is an improvement, and something to go on with.
Apparently the small beginnings of the
Australian Navy are to be built in this country
after all. It would be nothing short of a crime to
follow any other course, but for a little while
weird rumors suggested that the crime might be
committed. It is pleasing to find that there is
nothing in the rumors, and that Australia is going
to do its own work.
THE MODERN
MOLOCH.
Touching the complaint that
the children in many parts of
the country are practically
offered up as a sacrifice to Com.
A country that was ready for them might
pick out a fine asset from among the 10,000 men
who have lately been dismissed from the Wool-
wich arsenal, in England,, They are the men who
could not only build Australia's navy, but could
also make Australia’s machinery, and its pots and
its pans—if only Australia had put up the tariff
in time, and thus got ready to receive them. If
Kingston’s duties had- been adopted, Australia
might have got hold now of a : ready-made army of
skilled artisans ; and the Australian farmer would
have had the job of feeding men, who make the
bulk of that £10,000,000 worth of metals and
metal manufactures which the Commonwealth
now buys from the foreign manufacturer, and had
no 16,000 miles freight to pay bn the food either.

It is perfectly safe,*
The Devil was the first
secessionist. He seceshed
from Heaven, and now runs
Hell as a separate State.
A wail arises from all
Melbourne’s land agents
owing to the Vie. Govern-
ment s proposal to start, in
the Lands Department, a
“Freehold farms branch,”
which will register, with full
particulars, a list of all
freehold farms offered for
sale. The Minister hurries
to say that the State does not
intend to do the work of
selling, but merely wishes to
bring, the intending pur-
chaser (especially if he is an
immigrant) in touch with
“ the accredited agent.”
The squeal of the agent arises
from the fact that many ven-
dors put their properties in
the hands of many agents
at once, and as there are in
Parliament many enterpris-
ing land-agents, skilful in
the art of biting the Minis-
terial ear, besides many out
of Parliament with whom
certain Ministers are par-
ticularly chummy, the plan
may lead to a careful feed-
ing of these firms by Go-
vernment. When 17 agents
are trying to sell one farm
the Department can’t put
the prospective buyer “in
touch ” with all of them ;
and they all want to know
how the “accredited ” shark
will be selected. It would
be better if the Ministry
gave purchasers the option
of going, right through with
the State as sole agent.
Land-agents (mostly Tories)
should not be afraid of the
competition of so “costly
and blundering” a business
concern as they always de-
clare the State to be.
Sydney Chamber of Commerce sent a
deputation to the State Premier last week, and in
a stumbling speech E. H. Rogers announced that
the proposed Australian capital at Dalgety didn’t
“ fulfil the conditions of the Constitution.” He
didn t say how that alleged fact came to pass,
probably because he couldn’t. And as there was
an equally dead silence about three other mercan-
tile persons of great draught and tonnage, who
accompanied Rogers, things are no “forrarder.”
Here is a typical specimen of the N.S.W.
State. Parliamentary insect and the sort of green,
stuff it buzzes about:—
Mr. Broughton, M.L.A., is in receipt of a communica-
tion from the Department of Public Instruction to the
effect that arrangements have been made to allow a half
holiday to the boys of the sth, 6th, and 7th classes in the
public schools of the city and nearer suburban areas in
order to enable them to be present at the inter-State foot-
ball match to be played on Friday between the school-
boys of N.S.W. and Victoria.
Now, why should Mr. Broughton be in receipt of
information instead of the schoolmasters, except
for the fact that an election is at hand, and little
buzzing members have to get their names in
the papers somehow and anyhow and everyhow ?'
The slight difference between the anti-Aus-
tralian press interview and theadvt. (the first item
being the tail-end of a Sydney daily paper yarn

Last week there was formed in Sydney
“The Commercial and Industrial Federation of
Australia.” Its purpose is to fight like a herd
of devils against the new tariff, and presumably it
calls itself “industrial ” to create a false impres-
sion that the manufacturers are in the movement,
and that it represents real Australian industry!
The names of the organisers of said movement
follow
D. S. McPhail, Importer.
John Shorter, Importer.
Henry Howell, of Howard Smith and Co., Steamship-
owners. r
J. E. Edmondson, Importer.

From Sydney Town Hall there has been
issued a return dealing with the Wexford-street
resumption. The owners of the filthy locality
claimed £228,000, which seems a good deal to ask
for a street of such disrepute that no one could
acknowledge he lived there without implying
that he had slipped off the last rung on the social
ladder, and dropped with a wallop into the sludge
of the Abyss. The Council valued the collection
of hovels and tenements at £138,000, which, in a
clean and sane community, should also have’ been
viewed as ridiculous. When a place becomes so
filthy, unsavory, insanitary and tumbledown that
a public authority has to resume it for the public
safety, it should have no value—that is to say, the
property and something over should be taken from
the owners by way of a line. To possess a £5OO pro-
perty that is an eyesore and a danger to life and
health should be worth a £6OO fine any day. So
far, the Council has settled £160,000 worth of
claims for £105,000, equal to about 13s. in the £.
The inference is that the Council has been badly
taken down.

A WORSE DEVELOPMENT.
Within a year there have been two instances of Mel-
bourne men being sued for maintenance, who complained
that they had been married to strange women while
drunk and incapable.
CADY: "No, I’m off it, Gigs—off it for good
and all. When I came out of that last spree
of mine I found I’d had a touch of D.T.s."
GIGS: “ Good lor', that's nothin'. When I came
out of mine I found I'd got a wife!”
Iceberg Irvine grounded in rather shallow
water during the debate on the proposed increase
of Federal members’ salaries. He was making a
cold and pallid but lofty remark about the neces-
sity of consulting the people before doing things
like this, when he was suddenly asked if he con-
sulted the people before his famous disfranchise-
ment of the Victorian civil service. The question
was so peremptory that the Iceberg couldn’t
think of any brighter thing to say than “No.”
The Australian Postal Department has
come to a wise decision regarding the Tasmanian
cables. Four years ago the Eastern Extension
Co., which has a monopoly, and a subsidy and a
revenue guarantee for the service, offered Aus-
tralia its two cables for £70,000. The department
reckoned that £40,000 would be a verv corpulent
and portly price, and cried off. Since then
“ Eastern ” has been repairing its cables for
about 12 hours out of every 24. Interrup-
tions are almost continuous on at least one
line, and business gets frightfully congested.
The Government is setting out to lay its
own cables. ‘‘ Eastern’s ” contract and agree-
ments expire in March, 1909, so that it is
plain that after the date the Commonwealth
will get its plant for a song—if the Common-
wealth is independent of the company and
if the plant is worth buying as old junk.
However, Tory papers and Tory politi-
cians are already out urging the Government
to buy “Eastern’s” cables, and pointing out
what a benefactor “ Eastern ” has been to
Australia in the past. Isn’t it time that
somebody rose up and said that Eastern was
the beneficiary and not the benefactor ? It
charged Australia exorbitant rates for Euro-
pean cablegrams until the Pacific cable came
in and forced the price down to something
reasonable. The Eastern Extension Co.
has fattened on Australia for ever so many
years, and it could afford to hand over its
Tassy cables to the Commonwealth as a
present. But it is a powerful corporation,
and holds the championship belt for intrigue.
Look at that contract it got from N.S.W.
Postmaster-General Crick !
The Tory press, which so vigorously pro-
tested against the passage of the Federal Anti-
Trust Act, is at present making good copy out of
(a) the Tobacco Trust, (6) the Meat Supply ring,
(c) the raising of fares by the Shipping Combine’
and ( d) the Timber famine, engineered by the Tim-
ber Association. Some action under the Anti-
Trust law is contemplated against two of the
above combinations, and if it is found that the
law doesn’t reach them, it is already time to make
it more stringent.
The High Court has decided against
John Downer, K.C., and his client Vardoti in
their attempt to upset the election by the S.A.
Parliament of Laborite O’Loghlin to the Senate!
Downer demanded that the Court should order
the S.A. Governor to hold an election for a
Senator, but the Court replied that the Governor
was off its beat, or at least he wasn’t its drunk,
and it had no power to lay violent hands on him,’
or shout with a violent mouth in his ear. So
Downer was blown out without the real question
the validity of O’Loghlin’selection—beingreached.
The High Court also gave permission to every-
body to pay his own costs.
His eyes were red, his nose was blue,
He couldn’t speak, he’d just say “ Tchoo ! ”
And everybody round they knew
And pitied him, he had the “floo,”
At last he gasped “ what shall I do?”
And swiftly came the answer, too,
For each one cried “ Oh, fool ! procure
A bottle of Woods’ Great Peppermint Cure.”*
1 other day, in the House of Reps., that
staunch Freetrader, Bill Wilks, whose constituency
is a shipbuilding one, gave notice of his intention
to move that the bonus system should be extended
to the iron and shipbuilding industries. It was
ever thus. Theoretically, the Australian Foreign-
trader hates bonuses as an invoice fakir hates
honesty; in practice, when any Protection is
about he arrives invariably with a full-sized pan-
technicon van to collect as much of the Infamy as
he can lay his hands on ; and doesn’t turn Free-
trader again till some industry he isn’t interested
in is threatened with the accursed tariff heresy.
Simultaneously with its scream at the
tariff as “a Fiscal Outrage,” which makes the
public Pay! Pay ! Pay!!!” Sydney Tele-
gkaph momentarily forgets itself and tells the
truth :
The starting- of the furnace has had the effect of materi-
ally reducing the price of pig-iron in Australasia, so that
the assistance given to the firm through the tariff would
be more than made up by the advantages that users will
have m gettmg their iron as they require it, instead of
holding a stock of imported material, and obtaining the
local article at a lower price.
It is tolerably confused, but the facts are there.
From North Sydney
Sydney Telegraph made a bad break on Saturday last
by stating that Attorney-General Wade had “ delivered
an effective speech ” the previous night on behalf of
Carter, the selected Deform candidate for St. Leonards—
the truth being that Wade (though billed to do so)
never turned up. Things in St. Leonards haven’t been
over-bright, Carruthersly speaking, since Carter burst on
the scene. Half the anti-Laborites of the con-
stituency don’t want Carter ; and the rest don’t
know what they want. The main prejudice against
Caa-ter arises from the fact that he once openly
sold milk, or Still sells it in furtive fashion
or (even if he has stopped selling it for the
moment) is one who is liable to break out and sell milk
agrain on slight provocation. There is no suggestion that
the article Carter dealt in, or deals in, is, or ever was
other than good ; simply, Carter has milk-stains on him*
and in upper-class St. Leonards milk-stains are worse'
socially and politically speaking, than either birth, beer'
or blood stains. Most of the crowd that now objects to
Carter because of the milk taint in his record, objected
just as bitterly to Creswell—possibly because Creswell
had no connection with milk, or if that were not the
reason there was some other just as good. Meanwhile
the feeling grows that if things don’t simmer down a bit
amongst the Best People in this electorate, the Labor man
may slip in, m which case a number of stout villa-residents
will quite likely commit suicide, which would be most un-
sightly and lamentable.
Following remarks re the tariff by M.
Meagher, a director of John Meagher and Co
who run big general stores at Bathurst, Wyalong,
Barmedman, and other N.S.W. western towns,
in the Freetrade Bathurst Argus
Of course, there will be some alterations in the tariff
but, taking it rig’ht through, I think that in a few years
it will be found to be altogether in the interests of Aus-
tralia. We hear a lot about prices advancing, but we
heard that cry when the duty was put on cement. We
were told at that time that the price of cement would go
up, whereas, as a result of the duty on cement, we have,
within 50 miles of Bathurst, a great cement works em-
ploying 400 or 500 men, and producing an excellent
commodity at as low-, if not a lower price, than
that paid before the duty came into operation
Take another item on the list—blankets. Somebody
has said that the tariff imposition on blankets will send
up the price of these articles. This is an absurd state-
ment, because, for the past year or two, there have
scarcely been any other than colonial-made blankets
sold in this market. Blankets and other such lines are
made.in Victoria, where the people appear to be more go-
ahead than those in our own State. I hope that as a re-
sult of the tariff New South Wales capitalists, instead of
crying about Victoria getting the lead, will wake
up, and go in for industries and the building of factories
to compete with Victoria for the trade of our own State.
All of which, coming from one who is himself a
principal in a firm of importers, makes very
pleasant reading.
AURORA AUSTRALIS.
Dismal Dick Butler is getting tired of
the apparent permanency of his job as leader
of the S. Australian Opposition, and it isn’t un-
likely he will hand it over to Sudden Solomon,
who long ago was Premier for days, one even-
ing about breakfast-time. Every night, Butler
kicks himself as high up as he can reach without
being a contortionist because he didn’t leave the
wily Jenkins when that picturesque (Atlas) poli-
tician started to be Jenkins Iscariot. If he had
followed present Lands Minister O’Loughlin’s
example, Butler would probably have become
Premier of a Liberal Government, supported by
the Labor Party. The spectacle of Price, com-
fortably and firmly seated on the Ministerial
benches, is almost more than he can bear at the
salary—it’s only £2OO a year in S. Australia.

Ah, listen to the old man moan with burdens on his
back !
A thousand thoughts his trouble brings all swarming up
for speech :
“ Good gosh, Elizer ! Fashion tilings’ll rise clean outer
reach.
I see me fate in front o’ me ; it’s plain root-hog-er-die.
Alars! that I should ever see our good luck runnin’
dry.”
In vain the crushed one tries to choke his sorrow down—
alack !
He knows he is a pore ol’ bloke with burdens on his back.

COPENHAGEN.
Premier Kidston lately decreed that the
forking day in Bananaland’s Government service
mould be eight hours. It was something of a co-
mcidence that at the very moment when he was
coming to this decision the Labor party was fatu-
ously struggling to wreck him.
The Anti-Sosh Victorian cow-farmers have
struck a new idea in Sosh : they want the State
schools to instruct their youngsters in the
mysteries of milk and cream testing, and the
Department is invited to supply each school with
£5 worth of apparatus. “ History,” says Cow
Fat —“what’s the good of history and this yere
jograph.y ? Teach ’em about butter.” Poor little
beggars! There’ll only be their dreams left to
them soon; and even their dreams are liable to
be streaked with cow-yard slush and poddies.
The Westralian wheat statistics begin to
tell the old story. The average yield per acre
still keeps up pretty well (it was 13'6 bushels in
1903-4, and it was 11‘0 bushels last harvest,
according to the official reckoning), but the
country lately taken up is mostly averaging only
seven or eight bushels. Katanning and Wagin,
whence the bulk of the new settlers have gone,
both averaged under eight bushels last harvest.
Yet Katanning is as much as 225 miles from
Perth; and, as a rule, it takes from £3 10s. to
£4 10s. an acre to clear the land there. Consider-
ing that Westralia has still only about 250,000
acres under wheat, it is becoming pretty evident
either that Westralia isn’t a wheat-growing
country, or that the land that will grow wheat is
shut against settlement and use.
It was the Beauty of Judith that ravished the
eyes of Holofernes, and brought about the relief of an
army. It was the beauty of Desdemona that caused
Othello his first and only compunction. Beauty is, above
all things, powerful. Then, Ladies, be Beautiful I Go
and have treatment at the Valaze Massage Institute, a
pretty suite of rooms at 158 Pitt-street, Sydney, or 274
Oollins-street, Melbourne. Here all disfigurements can
be overcome, and loveliness substituted by the power and
efficacy of Electrical Massage. Hollows are removed by
by the new paraffin treatment, and a fresh complexion
adds a charm to the personality.*
One of the easiest things in the world is
to plant a tree—it is as easy as cutting it down ;
and easier still it is to sit on the fence and watch
the tree grow. New South Wales is trying to
find out this fact by means of a forestry commis-
sion ; Victoria has found it out, and is putting the
fact in an Act of Parliament. Vic.. Forestry Act
proposes to dedicate forestry.areas in perpetuity,
subject to reduction by nothing less than a reso-
lution of both Houses. Unhappily, under the
Bill, the Ministry has five years in which it may
excise “settlement areas” before the restriction
operates. If greedy landgrabbers don’t eat up
too much forest in those five years, Victoria
should have the chance of a grand timber asset.
There is money in trees. Even at present rates,
an acre of pines, after 15 or 20 years’ growth, is
worth £150, and wood grows dearer all the time.
Premier Moore (W.A.) held forth in his
policy speech on the subject of the great things
the Government had done for the mining indus-
try. Whereupon the hungry prospector mostly
grunts out his scorn. The Government has
helped all right, but Fat has got most of the
help, and when it hasn’t been Fat, it has been
somebody with a “pull.” For instance : The re-
presentative of a corpulent Bull co. bought a
mine at Higginsville. W T hen it had got down
80ft., and was thinking of a battery, Bull’s repre-
sentative got the State to spend £4000 in searching
for water and bringing it to the mine, on condition
that now and again for two years the co. would
crush for propectors. The two years will end next
May ; then Bull will have the £4000 water equip-
ment, but the prospectors and little mine-owners
won’t have a battery—they will have to pay just
whatever the Bull co. likes to charge.
Beauty. —There is no topic interests women more
and no possession they prize more highly than beauty. It
has been so through all the ages, and while human nature
remains unaltered will still be so. Hence the Valaze
Institute established by Mile. Helena Rubinstein here in
Sydney caters to a distinct want—and caters thoroughly.
All the advances in beauty culture made by the great
Complexion Salons of Paris and Vienna are practised at
the Institute, and there is scarce a blemish that mars the
human face divine but Mile. Rubinstein has a treatment
to successfully remedy it. Red noses, double chins,
superfluous hairs, flabbiness, u'rinkles, crowsfeet, are but
a few of the unlovelinesses that are permanently removed,
and even the eradication of birth marks and such like
serious blemishes are successfully treated. Ladies should
call into the Valazelnstitute when in town —even a sitting
of face massage had there will result in benefit to one’s
looks. The address is 158 Pitt Street, on the second floor.
Also at 274 Collins Street, Melbourne. Ask to see Mile.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, August 20, 1907.
My Dear Arint,—
Wandering Australians comment admiringly
in their home upon the dressing of the Queen.
At a recent splash—the opening of the Union
Jack Club by the King—the female monarch
wore a gown of deep purple velvet, with a helio-
trope chiffon stole, and a toque with clusters of
violets and a tiny jewelled Union Jack. Lately,
the royal lady wore a biggish picture hat (at a
race or a garden party—some out-of-door frisk),
and that section of the public which is more con-
cerned about the dress of royalty than the rags of
England’s submerged nearly died of complex
emotions, mostly made up of delight and surprise.
Hitherto, no one has seen her wear any but
toques and the like small deer on her head. But
she hasn’t repeated the wearing of the biggish
hat. She is back under the small one.
A two days’ sale of the valuable household
furniture of Lieutenant and Mrs. Rawson is
announced. The pair have been motoring—and
having influenza—in Queensland, but they are
better, and back at “ Wallaroy,” packing up their
wedding presents in readiness for England. Their
friends say that “he is so nice to her.” In this
commercialised, unsentimental age, the bride-
groom of six months who continues to help his
wife lingeringly into her theatre coat, and talks to
her during intervals at the theatre instead of
going out to see a hydrant, is voted a “ dear.”
The beauteous Mrs. J. B. N. Osborne (who
was Miss Maud Jeffries) leaves America to
rejoin her sheep-owning spouse on the 13th
of next month. The lady has been “down
South ” on a month-long visit to her parents, who
are said to own broad acres and many horses.
Horses are “down south” what sheep are in
Australia. A man’s value down there used to be
estimated by the size of his drove of niggers, but
that was before those famous disturbances at Big
Bethel,_ and Chickahominy, and Murfreesboro’,
and Chickamauga, and Chattanooga, and Spott-
sylvania, and all the other places where the name
on the station is so long that two trains can stand
in front of it at once.
“Mr. Hopkinson,” now running at Sydney
Cri., is, despite its absurdity, literally drawn
from life. London’s “smartest” flocked to it
when it first appeared, and shrieked approval of
the careful character portrayal to be found therein.
The Duchess, whose part was toned down later,
in deference to the wishes of some royalty or
other, was originally the Devonshire lady to the life
—the merry old soul of whom it has been said that
she “ knows more about cards and racehorses than
any man in England.” The fascinatingand chronic
co-re. was at once and enthusiastically accepted
by all who knew anything of the great world
about the English Court as an Earl whose appear-
ance in the Divorce Court was for long one
of the features of any really successful London
season. The gallant nobleman timed things in
thoughtful fashion ; he selected, As a rule, the
early summer as his time for being co-respondent,
that being the time when all his friends would be
in town to share the fun. “Hoppy” was vari-
ously identified as Lipton, “Solly” Joel—
S’African millionaire —and an ex-Lord Mayor of
London, who made up in good red gold what he
lacked in the way of mere aspirates. But it was
generally conceded that there were so many like
him amongst the Best People that it was impossible
to definitely fix Hoppy.
Miss Victoria Lyne, daughter of New Tariff
Lyne, is returning by the Mooltan. But she’ll
pause in her return at the green-and-red city of
Colombo, and stop there for a month.
In unobtrusive fashion Mr. Henning, the
millionaire racing owner, has arrived in N.S.W.
He is not here in search of horses, but to look
after some mining interests he has. In Cold
Country racing circles not to know Henning, at
any rate by sight, is to argue yourself a confirmed
and utter Jud. In those quarters, Henning is, to
a certain extent, It. Till recently, his ambitions
did not lie in social directions, but of late the
position has altered somewhat, and the man of
many shekels is said to propose entering the
sacred fane, if he has to use an axe over the job.
Henning is a bachelor, and would be a good sort
to marry ; so local maidens should be on the alert,
with pearl powder dry and ready, and the hypno-
tic smile at hand.
Art tor Art’s Sake, Art for Life’s Sake,
Art. for Sydney’s Sake—Mayor Hughes dealt
most deftly with them all when opening
the Society of Artists’ Show in the Q.V.M.
on Friday. The Society has cut itself off from
the old Royal Art Society, and this kind of ampu-
tation has to be diplomatically handled. Amongst
the women exhibiting are Misses Ethel Roberts,
Muskett, Quaife, Stephens, Vale, and M’Whan-
nell,. and they give a good account of themselves,
especially along color and decoration lines. A result
of Douglas Fry and Sid. Long’s collaboration is
“The Valley”—a star performance, although
the horsey-artistically inclined are “ saying
things” about the principal steed’s anatomy.
Howard Ashton’s “End of the Road” shows
him a long way on the bumpy and cobbled-stoned
track to Fame. All his work satisfies eye and
heart and judgment. Howard is now on the
S.M.H., and already his “ littery ” work is taking
the public eye. Sid. Long’s new clutch of cranes is
excellent, and Harry Weston’s Australian friezes
have always an audience of brides-elect (such a
lot of them about now), who would like “ our new
house decorated by him.”
Miss Grace. Palotta will have an At Home on
Friday afternoon at the Society’s rooms, and on
Monday Mrs. Hugh Ward will hold the after-
noon’s reception.
Mrs. Blanche Arral in afternoon street frocking
is an epitome of Paris style—big hat with the
new round, filet net veil, striped blue and white
blouse, with green velvet buttons, smart belt, and
short, dark-blue skirt, zouave of white aftd blue
serge, and a tawny white boa. Her benefit
concert will occur next , Tuesday night,
at Sydney Town Hall. Most probably the
Governor and the military will irradiate the
function. Miss Alice Bryant, Chester Fentress,
Laurence Godfrey Smith, Staell, and Sykes are
amongst those who will revolve on the platform
around the brilliant French singer.
Miss Rawson will open a Bazaar in the
Y.M.C.A. Hall on September 3—the proceeds to
go in aid of the work of the Sisters of the Church.
Woollahra, Potts, Darling and Piper Pointers—
‘‘pointers” in this connection has no dishonest
significance—will take stalls, and will be assisted
by Mosman, Neutral and Elizabeth Bayers and
Lane Coves. Contributions for any stall thank-
fully received.
An American paper containing a portrait of
Madge Corcoran is to hand. Victorians will
remember her better than N. S. Welshers. (I hear
quite a lot of people speaking of us lately as
“ Welshers,” and it gives me a bit of a shiver. Is
it an indelicate allusion to our Mr. Carruthers’
attitude towards the other States?) She was
one of a musical and dramatic family, and
a pupil of Mrs. G. B. Lewis, on whose
premises she had Eugenia Duggan for a fellow
student. Madge was as pretty a girl as any
in Melbourne, but though she climbed the pro-
fessional stage, and was acting off and on for
years in Australian capitals, she never seemed to
rise above average amateur level. Some six or
seven years ago she went to America, married and
acted herself into a good position. A few years
back she was a memher of Sothern’s co., and un-
derstudying the leading woman. Her portrait
shows her as Mercia, the chased lady in “The Sign
of the Cross.” A critic says splendid things of
her in the character which Maud Jeffries made
so tearful. Pretty Madge is now a widow.
Other mummer news from New York is that
Maggie Moore is to support Thomas Jefferson,
playing the part of Gretchen in “Rip van
Winkle.” Mabel Tagliaferro, now Mrs. Thomp-
son, is doing something wonderful in a circus
play.
At the recent Horse Parade and Show: Old
veteran to another, who wants to sell him a horse
for £400: “I’ve never yet seen the horse for which
I’d give £lOO a leg.”
News of the death of David Christie Murray
recalls that he married as his second wife a Mel-
bourne girl. Miss Alice Dudley. Her mother had
some billet of trust in the Victoria Coffee
Palace. Alice was a nice, round girl, much
younger than her “Dave.” They metduringone
of Harry St. Maur’s disastrous theatrical tours.
She wanted to be an actress (is there a girl who
doesn’t or didn’t ?). He wanted to be an actor —a
queer taste for a man to develop in middle age !
After the tour, which left him almost penniless,
he wrote the serial story, “Bob Martin’s Little
Girl,” in a few weeks. His barnstorming gave
him sufficient Australian backgrounds. I think it
ran in the Age or Leader, and Mr. David Syme
gave Murray enough for it to take him comfort-
ably off this continent.
A Sydneysider, writing from London, mentions
that she occasionally sees there the Queensland
squatter, Vicomte Oscar de Satge, and his wife
and a couple of infants motoring about. The
marriage of the unobtrusive aristocrat a few years
ago to a little Sydney typiste, who hadn’t put
her hair up or her skirts down, caused a ripple or
two for a week or two. Then the waters were
again calm, as if no big fish had been landed.
Some gossiper talks of the engagement of the
second Loch girl, Hon. Evelyn, to one of the
Gordon-Lennox family. When the Lochs ran
the vice-regal show in Victoria, the girl, whose
engagement is just announced, was a short-
frocked youngster (the Peerage coarsely states
that she is now 31), and gossip says that she,
her mother and elder sister had enough hair for
six. It was sleek and straight, and of that shade of
fairness that looks almost grey—an ashen blonde.
Good complexion, poor teeth and large features also
were theirs, but the second girl was a jolly little
soul, and if she were present on a dais when Pa,
the Governor, was opening something with a
speech, she would emphasise his points by wink-
ing at members of the staff. Loch had a more
beautiful beard than those of Dan O’Connor and
Editor Ward in combination.
Saw Mr. Warburton Gamble, of the Ward-
Willoughby Co., on Saturday afternoon, an hour
before he became the husband of little Miss Scaife,
of the same co. He and Willoughby came into a
tobacconist’s where I was buying clay pipes (for a
young friend to blow bubbles), and the bride-
groom-elect, whose teeth are as good as Captain
Share’s, was as cool as a fish. In fact, as
Willoughby mentioned, they’d “just been buck-
ing him up with a fish for lunch next door at the fish
shop.” Could anything be more respectable and
more free from the slightest suspicion of carousal
or frenzied dissipation ? Willoughby was mildly
reproachful about his “ alleged daughter.” The
stork handed him a boy, he says—“a big fat
boy.” At least I can plead in defence that I
guessed it the second try. The fat infant takes
after his pa, although Willoughby isn’t more than
half as opulent in the waistcoat as he was when
Sydney first made his acquaintance.
Senator and Mrs. Macfarlane, of Tasmania, are
in Sydney for a space. So is Mrs. Robert Walker,
of the same sober little island.
Miss Molly Smith, of Manly, and Mr. Willie
Dunlop, a member of the well-known Edwards-
Dunlop firm, are announced as candidates for the
“Wedding March ” to be played at them, and
expect to be elected by a large majority.
A man of my acquaintance tells me that he has
solved the mystery of the oyster patfi of the sub-
scription ball, which has no oyster. He had begun
to think that the caterers omitted the oyster, but
at the supper table of one of this winter’s charity
balls, he saw an old campaigneress lift the crust of
a whole dish of patties, withdraw the oyster from
circulation, eat it, and then replace the crust and
restore the empty sepulchre to its niche on the
dish. Well, as some ecclesiastical person remarks,
“ All wisdom cometh from the Lord.”
One of Sydney’s prettiest and cleverest and
froekiest girls is to take the star part in the
marriage drama about Easter. The man who
will play lead is a good-looking rising young
Australian. They are not telling anyone just yet,
which is the reason why I carefully avoid men-
tioning the matter. Only about 500 intimate
friends are in the secret.
To procure funds for the Mosman contribution
to the Australian Exhibition of Women’s Work,
the Mayoress of Mosman, Mrs. Leahy, presides
at an uncommon form of concert to-night
(Tuesday). It is to be conducted entirely by
women. The example might be followed by other
seekers after funds for the Ex.
One of the Telegraph’s lion cubs has been
nuzzling Mr. Bent into talking of “Paree.” The
gentle Victorian spent two days and three nights
in “ Paree,” and his observations narrow down to
diamonds, motor-cars —thousands of those —the
opera, hats worth £lOO, and the long flat feet
of the Frenchwomen. He merely mentions these.
The statements are rather bald as descriptions,
y,ut made humorous and intellectually significant
by Mr. Bent’s various adjustments of his top hat
—the moments of fervor when he took it off, and
the moments of scorn when he put it on straight,
and the moments of passionate abandon when he
dashed it sideways over one eye. But readers will
shy at Frenchwomen’s “ long flat feet.” Fashion
in French footwear is the long and narrow.
Often the Parisienne’s big toe has two or more
inches of unoccupied shoe territory ahead of it.
Length and narrowness are “ de rigger” and very
“degaggey”; but the "flatness” Mr.
didn’t stop long enough in “Paree” to see
French feet. The footwear he saw must have
been worn by strangers in the land.
An old lady who deserves recognition in the
Woman’s Column died last week at Neutral Bay.
Mrs. Beattie was known in Sydney as being at
the head of fashionable dressmaking—the Worth
of Sydney, in fact. For many years she was m
partnership with Mrs. Doak, in Wynyard-square.
She kept on the business right up to a few months
ago, when she was stricken with paralysis. She
made it a condition of her work for “swell wed-
dings’’that she should attend at the house and
see the bride dressed for the sacrifice.
The claim of G. H. Druce, of Maoriland, to the
Portland dukedom begins to look like business.
Druce, who has formed himself into a Limited
Co. to prosecute his suit, alleges that the late
Duke—who was a lunatic, by the way, and capable
of doing any old thing alive or dead—was not
buried where he is supposed to have been, but
lived to perpetrate him (G.H.D.), the Rightful
Heir. The present Duke (when he condescends
to discuss the matter at all) suggests coldly and
malevolently that Druce borrowed this yam
from Bilanderson of the Sydney Cri., and
begs that the preposterous topic be suffered to
drop. And it does drop, but the trouble is that
it won’t stay dropped. For years the highest
brand of London society has striven heroically to
take the same lightsome view of the matter, but
of late waverers have made their appearance
even about the very Court where the Duke is
Master of the Horse and the Duchess Mistress
of the Robes. Druce’s solicitor, one Coburn, a
coarse Australian person with no respect for his
betters (solicitors in the Motherland are, by the
way, on much the same social plane as tripe mer-
chants), now intimates that the case will come on
within the next two months; and when it does
come on, says Coburn, the revelations will be
awful and hair-raising.
Miss Constance Usher, a nice girl and a pretty
pianist, is engaged to the chief officer of a Jap
liner. He isn’t a Jap, though the liner is.
Mrs. Eileen Mitchell O’Moore (Bessie Doyle),
who is back in Sydney, teaching the violin,
married an unusually wealthy man—Mitchell—
someone of the steel-king tribe. But Fortune’s
wheel qamefull circle, and ill-luck was there. The
violiniste resumed her art, but her health went
steadily to the bad; hence her return to her
native land.
Arnold Gange, the basso of the late Amy
Sherwin co., with his white face, brown eyes, and
faint Scottish accent, will sing in Goulburn in
September. Talking of Miss Clara Butt, he
doesn’t think the Sydney Town Hall organ could
dominate her phenomenal voice. Her artistic
singing of Needham’s “ Husheen ” seems to dwell
in his memory. Miss Irene Aynesley, the Maori-
land contralto, whose career Melba backed so
warmly, is making large, round sums by singing
at Music Halls. This sounds to us like a descent
in the lyric ladder, but Gange swears by his best
mauve tie that it’s quite a high rung in old
England.
It has come at last. In sooth, in times of stress
the truth bursts into the open with all the inevi-
tability and force of the harried business man
who has returned from the office to find his
political wife discussing the tariff with 17 women
leaguers and one small, pale male enthusiast, in
the only room that has a fire in it. At a meeting
of baronets in London last month —called owing
to the perfectly sickening habit that assassins and
other social impossibles have of claiming member-
ship of the guild—the Main Rabbi, or whatever
he is called, of all the barts., one Richard
Harrington, uttered the plain, bald truth in
regard to knighthoods. A knighthood, said
Richard in effect, was no honor; in fact,
it was a badge of shame. He, Richard, would as
lief be a company-promoter as a knight. Had he
his way, certain offenders against law and order
should be made liable to knighthood as an alter-
native to the indeterminate sentence scheme.
Then, in broken tones, he told of a friend of his
“in a high position, who wished he was a
baronet, because it would save him from the dis-
grace of being knighted.” Whereat all the other
barts. said “hear, hear”; and “shame,” loudly
and decisively ; and wandered home explaining
to one another the absolute noisomeness of the
average knight; and how the whole institution
had dropped flowering, and gone to seed utterly
and for ever.
My Brisbane correspondent writes :
The week is ended, and the 10,000 visitors who thronged
the city during the Show, have “ blewed ” their last bean,
and tumbled themselves, with their wives and bundles,
into trains and steamers, and departed for Cow Land.
What a record it has been ! Record crowd, record show,
record weather 1 Every one was jolly. Mr. and Mrs.
Cocky had a lot more cash than usual to scatter this
year, and were quite well dressed, while the Panama
brigade from the stations indulged in motor cars and
champagne all day, and held chariot races up and down
George-street by night.
The popularity of your sailor Governor is not confined
to your own State. The Admiral Excellency has quite
captured the hearts of the Brisbaneites, and the sight of
“Miss Dimples” moved hardened squatters to tears as
they thought of their vanished youth and innocence, and
of what might have been but wasn’t. Father and daughter
have been a piece of bright relief in a rather icy and
formal vice-regal domicile. The truth of the matter is
that Her Firmness is a very sick woman, and without her
there has been little inclination on the part of His Frail-
ness to go about.
Beginning with the opening of the Show, at which Mrs.
Excellency didn’t appeer, he was kept busy apologis-
ing for her non-appearance all the week. Still there was
an imposing crowd from Government House. His Ex. and
Sir Harry, with Captains Newton and Wilson, filled the
landau ; Miss Rawson, Mrs. Villiers, the Du Cane, and
Verney the Sublime were squeezed into the barouche ;
and Col. Goad—he of the Indian Remount Department—
and the sleek Villiers occupied a hired conveyance
drawn by two grey shadows. Miss Rawson smiled
in a heliotrope cloth composition, with a white hat
swathed in velvet; while the stately Villiers dame
chose an opaline green and a hat with greenish
plumes and golden brown roses. The Du Cane lightened
her black and white robes with a big cluster of purple
on her breast. Villiers, M.P., in the course of a speech
in a cool bush shed, confessed himself “ flabbergasts d ”
at the resources of Australia. “Good Heavens!” he
passionately reminded them, "only foster your in-
dustries, and you can have the world at your feet.” And
we’re going to do it.
On Tuesday evening’, his weak, tired Excellency, with
Miss Rawson in a dream of a white satin robe, and. the
Du Cane, graced Mrs. Murray Prior’s dance, given, it is
understood, as a farewell before the hostess goes to Eng-
land, and makes the grievous mistake of arriving there
just as the autumn fogs begin to be a thick muddy
blanket over London town.
The last of the exclusive Assemblies flickered in a
partnerless State on Wednesday night, and the distracted
hostesses were hard pressed to find dancing men to go
much more than half round the bevy of bright country
girls that filled the room. The decorations were a
dream.
On Thursday evening the Government House Ball shone
with a splendor that had but one blot upon it, and that —
speak it not above a whisper—was the whisky. It dried
up. Lady Chelmsford made her first appearance of the
week in a shimmering grey satin and gauze, and the rest
of the household shone in brave attire. Mrs. Jim Robert-
son, in blue and silver, and Miss Leslie Harris took the
prize for clothes.
On Friday, Ted’s representative and Sir Harry left to
stalk the wily and dangerous snipe at Dellilah. The
women folk again drifted Showwards, and on Saturday
afternoon they took in the “Mother Goose ” matinee,
along with the Chelmsford hopefuls.
And, by way of a hurried wind-up, here are three
items. (1) Pretty Florence Waldron Taylor (with her
husband in close attendance) has returned from Europe,
and looks bigger, brighter, and bonnier than ever. (2)
The Villiers couple unfurled their deck chairs, and silently
stole away to Jappy land by the Yawata Maru on Friday.
(3) One of the best-dressed women at the Q.T.C. Races
was your Mrs. Ted Simpson. She wore a wonderful
gown of green silk and oriental appliqufi on Friday, and a
blue-braided velvet on Saturday.
Yours Affectionately,
Akenehi.

The Hand
With September, The Lone Hand begins color-
printing, and a reproduction in colors of Long-
stalfs famous “Breaking the News” will,fitly
mark the new departure. In future it is hoped
that, with its covers and frontispieces, The Lone
Hand will give to every Australian home a little
picture gallery.
The sweet breath of the pittosporum tells Aus-
tralians in September that Spring has come. The
Lone Hand will mark the month with special
Spring matter. Humor by “Hop,” verse by
Roderie Quinn, a charming idyll by Norman
Lindsay and Hugh McCrae, will sprinkle the
Spring number with smiles.
David Scott Mitchell was one of the unknown
great men of Australia. His recluse life shunned
publicity. The first revealing of his personality
is in The Lone Hand article, by Arthur W. Jose
(September). It is alone worth the
price, but is only one of several interesting
articles —“The Prime Minister at Home,” by
“F.R.,” “ Hunting in N. S. Wales,” by “First-
Check,” and “Politics and Poetry,” by “ J.B.D.,”
among them. There is matter to please every
reader—from the “sport ” to the literary student.
Alf Vincent has so far been absent from the
Lone Hand pages. He was away in Asia collect-
ing impressions. The first of his articles, full of
humor and bright pictures, is in The Lone Hand
for September.
Impossible to say all that is in—or nearly 1 all.

Melbourne Age opposes any increase of
the salaries of Federal members, but admits that,
after long and honorable service, “ the political
derelict is often brought face to face with the
bitter necessity of making a fresh start in life,
with the weight of age on his shoulders, with
used-up energies, and with his earning capacity
sadly diminished.” Had the paper been favor-
able, it might have pointed its moral with'the
story of Graham Berry and the men who fought
shoulder to shoulder with him to secure for the
Victorian democracy liberties which would be
cheap at millions. Every man of them, barring
James Munro, died poor, some of them neglected,
Berry himself in receipt of a niggardly pittance
wrung from a reluctant Parliament in a manner
that must have made the charity very bitter to
the grand old veteran. Munro still lives, but he,
too, is a poor man.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, August 19, 1907.
Mr Dear Yareik.—
The officers of the Sixth Australian Infantry
Regiment gave the whirliest sort of ball last
Friday. If a dance is to be endured at all, it is
just as well to pick a regimental one (that is if you
are Someone enough for an invitation). Military
men dance so well —and as for flirting who is
better than a sojer ! Then they do look so nice
and straight and gold-laced, and the dangling
little medals and jewels on their manly chests
are so fascinating—so much more interesting to
gaze at in the whirl of waltz than a plain
black coat. The newly-appointed Victorian Com-
mander—Colonel Stanley—shone as the particular
star. Colonel Evans has his pretty little Sydney
niece, Miss Mcßoberts, staying with him. She
“debbed” on Friday night, and didn’t the Subs
rush her! It was rather a manless dance—
though the fact was scarcely noticeable—the men
that were there took up so much room in the pic-
ture. The frocking was brilliant, and didn’t take
any second place with the gold lace. Two gowns
stood out conspicuously. One was beautiful. It
was soft twilight-purple crepe, and all the lacey
soft white frills showed glimmering through. The
other was hideous, vivid orange silk—it was a
parrot-scream of color over the warm shout of
regimental scarlet.
It’s quite an old and monotonous moan of young
girlhood that the widow and the smart married
woman gaily attach the available men and the
nice boys, while early spinsters have to be con-
tent with the downiest and pinkest and most
callow of youth. The contrast is made more
painful by the woeful precocity of the Australian
she-lambkin. But things are reaching a high
pinnacle of shriek when grandmothers take up
the running. The widow of a wealthy Going-
going-gone citizen is the immediate ancestress of
two smart chicks, prosperously married, who
have junior chicks fluttering at their heels. But
grandmamma doesn’t indulge in side curls and an
armchair. Her curls are the newest “extras,”
and she seeks the cosiest corner of Cafe Paris for
afternoon tea or supper, and “takes notice”
quite frivolously with one of Melbourne’s very
prompt lawyers.
Mrs. Reed, of Kenly, Elsternwick, gave an At
Home on Thursday (August 15), in honor of the
marriage of her sister, Miss Eugenia Stone. The
wedding was celebrated in London at 2 o’clock,
and the evening reception of Miss Stone’s inti-
mate friends in Melbourne exactly corresponded
with the hour of the event. It was a warm-
hearted gathering. Incidental to the drinking
of the distant bride’s health, pretty speeches were
made by the Hon. F. C. Mason and Dr. Harbin-
son, and warmly responded to by Mr. Stone. The
bride’s initial in wattle, and the bridegroom’s in
oak leaves, were twisted into a huge monogram
and hung over the board that the food was on—
the festive board, as the daily paper loves to
call it.
Now that the “Madcaps” have gone, Melbourne
misses a tievy of enthusiastic golfers. Many of
the chummy little lovey-dovey co. were players,
but Miles Clifton and Mrs. Daisie Wallace Clifton
and baritone Kenneth lived every spare moment
at Fisherman’s Bend with a devoted caddy, and
grubbed round happily for lost balls. “Majah ”
Clifton even developed “golfer’s wrist,” which
seems to be worse than housemaid’s knee. The
spirited “ Majah ” had a knot cut out from his
wrist —but went on with his dance and song never-
theless. He was about the only mummer of the
crowd who did not draw on his understudy during
the season.
The fluffiest and eldest of the clutch of the
gilt-edged Horsham Youngs (who ship horses to
India) departed last week on the Yorck for a con-
tinental trip. She nestles under the youthful
wing of cousin Lily—Mrs. Wallach, a smart St.
Kilda dame. Mr. Wallach goes also. He’s an
ideal husband, and is warranted to fix the chairs
at the right angle, and pile the rugs and cushions
at their cosiest.
The “Hurraw! Hurraw! Hurraw!” boys
finished up their career in these parts by scoop-
ing in all the goals at hockey-on-the-ice. But the
Australians were not jealous—the Canadians had
skated since their babyhood, while the local
hockeyites have had barely two winters in a
Glaciarium. The ice rink did the game proud
with soft-colored lantelns and a good band, and
a Governor or so to applaud.
The bewitching Mexican lady who com-
placently puts up with much lorgnette-pointing
at theatres and such, just now, has an interesting
Spanish husband. Hubby, however, has to take
a minor place in the theatre box. There is a third
member of this attractive family—a very small
maiden of four or five years.
The reconstructed Stirling-Fenner engagement
is booked for a wedding-bell climax this week.
Dr. Stirling’s lily-fair daughter has been getting
together many frills in honor of the event. Lilies
of every kind are to figure profusely as the em-
blematical wedding flower, and Macedon gardens
have been raided for a truck-load of the pure
white blossoms. Talking of which, one is rather
reluctant to remark, in parenthesis, that the New
Testament lilies, whose array of loveliness out-
classed the spectacle of Solomon-in-all-his-glory,
were very different from the emblems of purity
that get credit for a sweet scriptural advertise-
ment. The lilies that put Solomon’s regal clout to
shame were the gorgeous crimson-scarlet variety—
short-stalked and bell-shaped—which exactly fill
the average Hebrew idea of choice raiment. And
they bloom not in the spring worth tuppence.
There are still rumors of Amy Castles’ d4but in
grand opera. That poor debut will be worn out
before it arrives. The last hearing was a Berlin
appearance, postponed because the maiden
developed German measles in London before sail-
ing. Sister Dolly, who came into prominence
later, and studied with so little fuss, is getting on
famously in small, ’cute, comic opera parts in
London.
The Naval and Military Club is the centre of
most serious discussion. A huge ball is on the oil-
cloth —a combined shivoo of the gold-laced of
land and sea. Derby night is the suggested date,
and the tone of it is to be so swagger that
there is likely to be a pale rose aura round
whatever hall is chosen for the festive whirl.
Just now plans are chaotic—battles, and the roar
of the artillery (which isn’t getting its own way)
threaten to smash up the peace of theclubites, and
cast a veil of smoke over the event itself.
Janet Missus’ return to Cliveden was the signal
to commence operations concerning the Newsboys’
Society’s annual ball, which will happen on Sep-
tember 3, in Prahran Town Hall. The Dowager
is treasurer, and Misses Muriel Cumming and
Jessie Landale join forces, with a brace of
experienced male persons as hon. secretaries.
Mrs. Forrest will guide a flock of debutantes into
the hurly-burly.
Harry Sweeney, the young man beautiful who
replaced Carter Pickford with the Flemming Co.,
becomes leading man in the Holloway Co. anon.
His pretty wife also recommences mumming in
the same crowd, and will play grand dame parts
when necessary.
The Fisken family returns almost immediately,
owing to the ill-health of genial John. All the
time he has been “abrawd” he has been ailing,
and like a sensible man, he concludes that Aus-
tralian air is the best cure obtainable. Mrs.
Fisken dutifully accompanies him ; but the
McCaughey daughters linger awhile in Fogland
enjoying the novelty of a sunless summer, and a
nation which says “ Aw 1 ” before it can make up
its mind to say “ Reahly ! ”
Mrs. Tittell Brune really and truly leaves us on
26th September. Mr. Tittell will accompany her,
and the public will know neither of them for a
litt'e while. The lady expects to be back again in
March, 1908; meantime she will meander about
the Old World, seeing famous actresses playing
the parts that will make up her new repertoire.
On Thursday, the Athenaeum Club indulged in
a festive afternoon. The occasion was the hang-
ng of Justice Holroyd—or, rather, an admirable
portrait of him, painted by Leslie Wilkie. Mr.
McDougall “ chaired ” the proceedings, and
everyone said complimentary things to the artist
and the original about the picture. His Honor
was quite touched by his own obvious popularity,
and by the amazing resemblance of the picture to
himself, and said so very gracefully. Then he
was given a smaller replica of the club’s acquisi-
tion, which, it is suggested, should one day revert
to the National Gallery.
Miss Beatrice Irwin, the superior young person
whose well-advertised grandmother, Lady Hil-
liard, “ is not yet reconciled to her grand-
daughter’s stage career” (poor old lady !), has
some relatives of polite significance to the city of
Sydney. She is either a niece or cousin of your
judicial G. B. Simpson, and will probably be the
guest of his family what time she play-acts in his
neighborhood. Inquiries about the well-bred
young woman’s histrionic capabilities are replied
to with a full and particular account of her
ladylike deportment and her disgusted granny.
But, nevertheless, the blessed Beatrice’s mum-
ming promises to be the happy mean ’twixt a
walking lady and a star tragedienne—which
means that she’ll be natural, pretty, and hard-
working.
Barrister G. A. Maxwell, of the eloquent
Scawtch tongue, and his charming missus, are the
latest pair who need to decide upon a nice name
for the new baby. The names of John, Henry
and William are barred by circumstances over
which the baby has no control; but Juliet might do.
It would seem that we are reverting to our
grand-parents’ habit of marrying before we’ve
been in and out of love more than three times.
During this month no less than four couples, all
of whom are only skirting the mid-twenties, have
battened themselves down in matrimony.
Even society Bridge players have their virtues,
as one specially proficient performer has learned
by experience. The player in question is a pro-
verbially bad loser, and one day, awhile ago,
when the cards were going dead against her, she
created a diversion by walking off with the
character of a popular nurse. Said nurse had a
friend at the next table. The lady rose in her
wrath and demanded an apology, which the Cat
vixenishly refused to give her. “Very well,” re-
marked the avenging angel, “ I leave the house.”
Things were whirly enough to demand the ser-
vices of a referee, who gave unqualified judgment
in favor of the nurse. A quiet, but firm, hint of
future proceedings brought Cat to her senses, and
the necessary apology was forthcoming. Next
came apologies to her fellow guests, play being re-
sumed after a stormy interlude. The Cat still
arches her back and does great enlargement of the
tail if you mention nurses in her hearing, but she
got a lesson that, most of her acquaintances are
sure, will do her good.
“ Human Hearts,” with the much-boomed
Leicester as the tall and good-looking hero, was
wedged into the Princess’s crowded dates on
Saturday for a twelve nights’ run. The audience
was shown much of the blackness and ’ardness of
the ’uman ’eart, but the management neglected
to advertise the bellow-drama as a tragedy, and
the hard-hearted house took the scenes as purest
farce. Anyhow, it’s better to laugh than weep.
Bent —the rotund, the newly-returned—was in
the manager’s box. What a reception he got!
Handclapping everywhere, and cheers and '"ells
of laughter from the gods.
A malicious member of the Devil’s Own Infantry
tells of the occasion upon which a legal light of
impeccable habits went forth to buy his better-
half a birthday petticoat. It was a difficult
matter, so he enlisted the aid of an eminent K.O.
who has a roving eye and is credited with a store
of esoteric knowledge. Off went the pair to an
emporium where linrierie fin is obtainable at
astounding prices. The junior Gentleman One
left the question of selection to his experienced
leader, and merely paid. “Would you like a
card enclosed?” asked the sales-dame. “Of
course,” said the experienced counsel. Where-
fore, a heap of scandal, an angry matron, and a
fusillade of jeers.
Sing a dirge for the days when a pampered cat
may flaunt her handsome furs and daintily warm
raiment to the mental discomfort of the utili-
tarian cats whose fur is just plain cat. Spring is
in the next street to us, and it’s easy to scent her
near approach, whereat the Sex experiences true
joy. In the spring, “A young man’s fancy
lightly turns to thoughts of love,” chortled Gov.
Tennyson's papa. In the spring, we women set
about offering man sufficient inducement to think
seriously of matrimony in the autumn. All
winter, we’ve felt the pinched blue tips of our
noses chilling our ardent or amiable souls (one
woman can’t combine both qualities). Even cats
who are girded with nice, decorative wraps, feel
the saddening influence of winter. But the luck-
less ones who paddle round in "serviceable” (hate-
ful word !) winter garments are absolutely crushed
by them. Now that spring is so near that a well-
aimed brick might hit it at any moment, we all
feel better, and unanimously rush the season’s
rag-shows, to copy, bargain, or buy. (I believe
there are even people who take things when the
sales-person isn’t looking.) And the pleasure of
it—to know that becoming frocks can be bought
for any price, from twenty shillings upwards ! And
the possible results of calling attention to one’s
figure in its strictly financial bearings. I really
think that many men have been dragged from
bachelor-grace by the girl’s protestations that
everything that is between her and the outer
world cost less than £2. It gives him a chance
to dream of_ domestic happiness on the cheap.
But, as a general rule, there is no cheap domestic
happiness in practice. It costs all that there is.
The fluffy little rose-clad maiden who makes a
hit in theFrenchy “Lady Madcap” dance is a very
young munmieress and a local chick—Molly
Wilson, granddaughter of dear old Dr. Gray.
Her entry into the “profesh” was made in the
“Children’s Scene” of the “Ghastly Wedding,”
where the benevolent Dutch master of the revels
used to introduce her as “ Madcap.” Molly isn’t
mumming just for the fun of the thing, either;
although the Wilsons were wont to roll in
sheepy wealth, their many thousands of woolly
acres slipped away in desolating drought time.
The squattocracy is subject to change in its
individuality, and the changes are not always for
the better.
The dashing demoiselles who glowed and
glid (or is it “glode” or “glidded”?—any-
how they glade) round Sydney Glaciarium
during its earliest days, are finding the
local refrigerator rather a warm place just
now. Which paradox has evolved from their
inter-State success. The Cats who weren’t en-
listed to make a skating pace for Harbor-siders
unite in looking fiercely upon the luckier lasses,
and infer that it’s shocking form for people with
polite pretensions to do things better than their
peers. There’s nothing more annoying than the
other Cat’s success—even in such a personal
matter as the maintenance of her rectitude in a
slippery situation.
In the story of a recent Melbourne (Toorak dis-
trict) dinner-party there is a striking suggestion
for the third act of a melodrama. The host, not very
long married, sits at the head of the table, faced
by his young wife, radiant and beautiful, in her
most seductive gown. On his left his familiar
bachelor friend keeps the dinner-dressed com-
pany up to the fashionable mark. Everything in
the room is lovely. Host is perceived to be
making rather unnatural efforts to appear
gracious and debonair in his manner to
everybody, especially to his wife. Presently
he raises a glass of champagne on high as he
begs to propose the health of a married lady
and a gentleman of the party. With suitable
dramatic gesture he intimates to his uncomfort-
able guests that a certain husband has been be-
tra-a-a-ay-ed by the wife on whom he had doted,
and that the third party is the trusted
friend of the family. He drinks long life
and happiness to the Guilty Pair, and—this
is where the gallery should thunder ap-
plause—he gives them ten minutes in which
to clear out of the house—together. There
were no thunders of applause for the denouement
of this unrehearsed scene. The unincriminated
guests exchanged glances to the effect that they
were more shocked than surprised, you know.
The Guilty Pair, trembling before the accusing
forefinger of the outraged husband, rose from the
table and did actually clear out within the stipu-
lated ten minutes, or thereabouts. Curtain. What
one misses in this widespread story is the popular
deed of polite violence —the flinging of a glass of
wine at the villain’s shirt-front. Seemingly, he
was allowed to leave the house with his broad
expanse of linen unspotted before the world.
“Rosna” writes from Adelaide :
Lady Le Hunte opened the local Women’s Work Ex-
hibition, on August 17, in the presence of the local
nobility and the common and uncommon herd. It was a
great crowd and a frocky one, and the viee-re o al dame
beamed with pride on the goodly result of her labors.
She and the Lieutenant-Ex. Way have bestowed a load
of enterprise and energy on the movement. The decora-
tions, as far as one could judge in a dense thicket of
heads, were rather gorgeous, but more of that when I
have viewed them minus the thicket. There is a pleasant
drawing-room, wherein some of the committee members
will entertain the Rank and Fashion at receptions and
such all this week ; and there are entries by the furlong
and by the ton in most sections.
The stalwart Besses o’ th’ Barn have been dispersing
sweet noises over Adelaide for a week, and the Salt of
the State has come out from its lair and spread itself
over the front seats. The Besses gave two performances
daily, and committed Hallelujah choruses, “Lohengrin”
overtures, and other strenuous melodies, about a dozen
times each concert, without showing signs of disrepair.
What time they were not blowing upon the brassy horn
the Besses were feted by the populace. The city gave
them a formal welcome, and his Ex. went along to hold
out the hand of fellowship. Then the Lancashire men of
the State held a rally for them, and the atmosphere was
heavy with strange Manchester sounds and with weird
cries from Garstang, Whalley and Bacup, likewise Catteral
and Bay Horse.
We are to have a new mayor in a month or two. He is
a bachelor and wealthy, and Adelaide is glad, because it
sees visions of splendid entertainments such as it knew a
few years ago. A mayor with no encumbrances and many
shekels is apt to spend his official salary on the citizens,
whereas the married mayor buys new frocks for Susan
with the proceeds, and takes little Johnny to the panto-
mime. Probably a sister, or one of the pretty nieces, of
the new Worship will be mayoress.
The H. C. Swans leave for a two years’ jaunt in Europe
this week. The name has been a well-known squatting
one since the very dark and early ages of the State, this
branch of the family having originally squqftted at Angori-
china. Of late years, the Swans have cooked their break-
fast chop at the Semaphore.
The School of Mines boys gave their first ball on the
16th, and a great quantity of youth and beauty went
along to trip a measure in the Brookman Hall. It was a
very hilarious affair, and the horde of young assayers,
engineers, etc., in embryo manipulated it with the
beautiful lavishness of youth, to which the shekel is but
a means to an end and not an end in itself. They even
went out and bought a goodly supply of powder, hairpins
and like mysteries, and stocked the ladies’ cloak-room
therewith. The School’s infant effort seems likely to
grow into an unusually popular annual ball.
We put on our best hat on August 16, and went to the
University sports to see our stalwart brothers, cousins
and uncle's achieve high jumps, Gretna Green races, and
other strenuous things. A few first spring frocks dotted
the landscape. The sky was very blue, and the grass was
very green, and the pleasant Excellencies went to the
thing to hand the trophies and felicitations to the
winners. Altogether we were glad we wore our best hat.
The Victorian singing maiden, Lizzie Newbold, whohaf
been persuaded to stay in Adelaide and warble for some
of its suburbs, committed a concert at the Semaphore
last week. Nightingale Lizzie scored a large-sized sue
cess, and had to respond to many encores.
Yours affectionately,
JOHANKA.

THE SECESSIONISTS.
Despite the high level of work shown by the
Secessionists at their exhibition in Q. V. Market
Chambers, Sydney, it is essentially a two-man
show. In the average annual exhibition the
work of these two men —one unknown and the
other already “arrived” —would dwarf interest
in all the other canvases; but the Secessionists
have got together a surprising amount of good
work, and have been kindly drastic to the in-
competent. The “rotters” are singularly few
and as inconspicuous as they shall be here.
But of the two men. Norman Lindsay shows a
representative collection of his genius—rthe word
is deliberately used—that will bring home to
Australia the fact that it has produced an artist,
who, without leaving its shores, has equalled
the best black-and-white work in the World.
This opinion will be echoed by over-seas art-
critics—by-and-bye. Lindsay’s panel of exhibits
includes the best of his Casanova illustrations—
a continuing delight of execution and artis-
tic vision. He has everything that will lead
him to; even greater heights; his inexhaust-
ible energy is combined with painstaking
industry to, a remarkable degree. An apt
illustration of his thoroughness may be given.
Commissioned to do a drawing of a mob of horses
for The Lone Hand— an illustration for a story—
Lindsay got together a small mob of horses and
made his studies from their grouping. Lindsay’s
work is suffused with the joy of life ; his panel is
a riot of paganism, a saturnalia of a not
too spiritual joy. Nymphs and satyrs laugh
and love with a frank abandon, for these are the
lesser gods of Lindsay’s pagan faith. His work
shocks by if.s. sheer realism ; it delights by its
thoroughness ,apd strength. His talent is the
most pagan thing that has come out of Australia J
it will prpbably prove indigestible to the Jud-
kinses. ;His color work is, at present, but experi-
mental, a little stiff, a little crude. There is more
color in his black-and-white. He sees the glad
riot of this world in monotone.
The other man is J. J. Hilder, a young bank
clerk from somewhere out West, Where Lindsay
fprces admiration by his strength, Hilder cun-
ningly solicits it by his tenderness. His work is
but a beginning —little landscapes, absurdly low-
priced, that will be quickly bought by even the
undiscerning. He has an almost unconscious
vision of beauty, and a color sense rich and
strange. In his most delicate moods you know
him to have his masculine reserves. He may go
far. Meantime there is his monthly salary at the
bank. And of the other's, Lionel Lindsay’s
exhibit is quite astonishing in its variety and
interest. He feels color more keenly than
his brother; his etchings are the real thing,
and some of his pen drawings are exquisite.
We suspect that Lionel Lindsay was born in
Spain. His brother was surely born in Greece.
Julian Ashton has a big show of clever and
sturdy work ; and his influence upon his pupils—
Hilder is a brave example—is everywhere notice-
able. Howard Ashton’s main landscape, if a
little scrubby and a little lacking in interest
in the foreground—the critic will admit
justification for the artist’s treatment —shows
a complete emancipation from the pardon-
able imitativeness of earlier years. This time he
is—and greatly—himself. His landscapes are ail
solidly pleasing. Sid Long has pastorals and
decorations full of charm. “Morning Mists”
shows his fancy at its best, though,
strangely enough for a decoration, it fails
to “carry.” With D. Fry, he has produced
one of the best pictures in the show—a
well-drawn horseman at the head of a mob of
horses looking back into a delightful valley.
D. H. Souter is doggedly and finely decorative.
Harry J. Weston, in addition to much fine
poster work—notably a brilliant Arab effect
(hung in the passage) that would have scorched
every canvas near it, and two humorous pictures
of a series representing a ’possum hunt—has a fine
example of his Australian friezes, a patriotic
department of art that he has made his own. We
commend to the tariff makers a bigger duty upon
the imported Dutch canals that meander
so irritatingly about so many of our best rooms
when the real Australia can be so admirably
pourtrayed. Fred Leist, beside some “slick”
water-colors, shows a commendable portrait,
which, though somewhat lacking in the modelling
of the flesh, and with an awkward arrange-
ment of the dress that dwarfs the model,
makes a fine color harmony. Alice J. Mus-
kett’s pastels are the best of the portrait
work shown. The Secessionists are Curiously
shy of portraits, and (with the exception
of N. Lindsay) of the nude. Arthur Streeton
has some half-dozen characteristic sketches of
Cremorne and Mosman —one of Cremorne being
shown in that blaze of sunlight that only Streeton
and the French impressionists know how to
paint. Sid Smith has some clever pen drawings.
Aliington E. Jeffery has an interesting land-
scape that recalls the stiff, smooth, decorative
treatment of Swedish artists. Madeline Duret
has a good flower-study. All the other
flower-studies are horribly like flowers. Among
the other noticeable woman exhibitors, most
of whom display, combined with much charm of
decoration, the almost universal feminine inability
to draw, are Viola Quaife ; Ruby Winckler, who
manages to display an enviable amount of leg for
an absurdly small price; M. Ethel Roberts, whose
work is altogether delightful; and Muriel G.
Nicholls, whose studies of children are full of a
sypipathetic humor. In the vestibule is an
exhibit, from L. W. Appleby and Arthur H.
Adams, of gum-bichromate photographs, whose
inclusion in an art show is fully justified by the
individuality of the work. This water-color pro-
cess enables the artist to subordinate the mechani-
cal workjif the camera to the artistic intention of
the picture-maker.
The Secessionists, by giving the best show of
recent years, have vindicated their secession.
The Iron Industry.—No. III.
The “Great Natural Industries” and
Another One.
This Australia of ours is a bad shape. It needs
more deep gulfs and coastal indentations. If a
few million cubic yards were scalloped out of its
rim and piled up in ranges inland, it would make
a vastly different Australia of it. We should then
have something more than a circular coast with a
mere fringe of well-watered territory. Still, we
have got to make the best of it as it is; for the
construction of gulfs and Himalayas is beyond the
engineer so far. Recurring droughts must, there-
fore, continue to be a dark feature of our history.
Their influence hitherto has been greater even
than it might seem to be on the surface. They
produce—or, at any rate, are the chief factor in
producing—our booms and our depressions. When
the country booms it naturally plunges into ex-
travagance. Works are planned and methods
adopted beyond the country’s real needs. For pro-
perty, pricesare paid and engagements entered into
which average conditions do not justify. Then
come drought and depression. The pendulum
swings back as far as it flew forward. Forced
realisations and ruin follow in hundreds of cases.
Governments, hard pressed to keep the popula-
tion together, pledge their credit and pay high
prices for large sums of borrowed money to spend
on works which will not pay, and which never
would be undertaken if it were not for the sake of
providing work for those whom drought and
disaster have laid idle. So a permanent burden
of taxation is placed on the people—to pay interest
on works which can’t pay their own interest.
* * * *
To a great extent the bad shape of Australia is
responsible for all this. But we might have done
a great deal more than we have done to neutral-
ise the bad effects. Drought is our natural curse;
yet practically we have only pursued those indus-
tries that are the most liable to be knocked out
by drought. For some extraordinary reason, they
call these, nevertheless, the natural industries.
Heaven only knows why wool-growing and wheat-
raising are “natural”; no wild sheep pursued
Captain Cook to bite him, for the pretty good
reason that there was no sheep here when he
landed ; and, if he wanted wheat, he had to bring
it. There is no earthly reason, then, why these
industries should'be held in veneration, and why
they should be extolled as “natural” and all
others viewed with suspicion as exotics. On the
contrary, since they are both so liable to be badly
droughCstrieken, there is a very good reason why
Australia should not depend so much upon them,
unless it has a fancy for violent and disastrous
fluctuations. The chances are indeed that if it
doesn’t establish other industries —drought-proof
industries—the fluctuations will be more violent
than they have been as the people spread out
further from the fringe.
* * * *
But while the wool and wheat industries have
been grafted on to Australia, and could never
have been evolved out of the country and its own
resources, Captain Cook might have found here
everything necessary for a great iron and steel
industry. Not one single essential thing is lack-
ing. And mostly the essential things are con-
veniently placed in relation to one another. J. B.
Jaquet, then, of the N.S.W. Geological Survey,
in 1900-01 examined the available iron-ore deposits
of the State, and gave particular attention to
those of Carcoar and Cadia, which are only about
16 miles apart. At Carcoar he estimated the ore
in sight at 3,168,000 tons. At Cadia the deposits
are “practically inexhaustible”; J. B. Jaquet
put down 39,000,000 tons to go on with. From
Carcoar to Lithgow the distance is but 90 miles,
with rail all the way; and at Lithgow there are
“abundant supplies of coal, which are now being
delivered at the pit mouth at a cost not exceeding
4s. per ton ” ; there is unlimited water available ;
and “ good limestone can be obtained at Portland,
which is distant by railway from Lithgow only
16 miles.” As to the 90 miles which separate
the coal and the iron, Chief Justice Madden, of
Victoria, came back from America the other
week to urge Australia to develop an iron trade,
and he incidentally mentioned, as one reason
why Australia should enter into the busi-
ness heartily and with good hopes, that
ore is now being carried 1000 miles to the great
works at Pittsburg. According to Jaquet, “the
average distance that the ore has to travel between
the [American] mines and smelting works is about
800 miles.” Of the enormous quantity of iron ore
consumed in Great Britain, it is estimated that
over 30 per cent, is imported from foreign coun-
tries, chiefly Spain ; while of the Swedish ore-
still in great request —the greater portion is
carried from 1000 to 1500 miles before being
smelted. Nature set the three great essentials
together within our own doors : and if the use of
them doesn’t constitute a natural industry, it is
hard to conceive what a natural industry can
possibly be.
*■ * * *
Probably if Australia would get right out of
the foolish habit of regarding growing wool and
wheat as the only natural industries, it would be
more disposed to give a hand to some others.
These others might then at least claim the same
consideration and help that wool and wheat have
had. For wool had, for a start, vastly more help
than is generally supposed. It was provided with
land for nothing, and labor —convict labor—for
practically nothing. The wheat-growing indus-
try was established on those same foundations.
In the matter of stock-raising, the Government
bore the whole expense of shipment after ship-
ment. In 1798 “ the ship Marquis Cornwallis
left Sydney for the Cape of Good Hope, under
contract, to procure cattle for the Government.”
That was only one instance. Those who established
the great stock-raising business were given free
land, convict labor, and even then the Government -
helped them with stock. And after all that, in
1830, twelve years before N. S. Wales got its
Constitution, the pioneers of the great wool and
stock growing business, were so hard pressed that
“a duty was placed on all beef and pork imported
into the colony:” These “great natural indus-
tries” that the'Foreign-traders always! assume
never wanted any “ coddling,” did, as a matter
of fact, require and get more help than even the
most uncompromising Protectionist would now
venture to ask for the iron and steel industry.
And those “great natural industries” of wool
and wheat growing, fostered into activity 100
years ago, didn’t have the violent competition of
organised industrialism to tight their way against.
No message like this, published a week or so ago,
was ever sent about foreign wool and wheat pro-
duction
The Steel Corporation of the United States, believing
that Gary, Indiana, will become a great steel manu-
facturing centre, has voted £9,000,000 for the construction
of works there, making its total investment £24,000,000.
It is the business of that Corporation to keep the
markets it has got and win new ones, and to do
it the vast soulless concern has no compunqtion
about crushing any competition that presents
itself. If it costs half-a-million to rid a market
of a rival, it doesn’t think twice about spending
the half-million; the rival gone, and the lesson
of its own giant power taught, it can settle
down confidently to squeeze out the half-million,
and big interest to boot, from the people over
whom it has thrown the ever-extending net of its
. monopoly. That Corporation has its agents in
Australia, tendering for every big order for steel
and iron goods that Australia lias to offer.
Without high Protection what possible hope has
an infant industry in this country got against it?
What possible hope has the unprotected Aus-
tralian of getting this work of iron and steel
making to do? And so long as it doesn’t make
the iron and steel, the secondary industries of
manufacturing iron and steel goods must in-
evitably be trivial.
* * * *
Further, if Australia wants more outlets for its
workmen, and more outlets for the workmen it
hasn’t yet got, but needs, it also wants more out-
lets for its capital. The banks and other financial
concerns have so far looked chiefly to land mort-
gages for their securities. The growth of funds
in the hands of life-assurance societies is, how-
ever, one of the most striking features of Aus-
tralian life; and for the best mortgages there is
keen competition between these societies and the
banks. One insurance society alone has at its
command £23,000,000, an increase of nearly
£9,000,000 in 10 years. So instead of Australia’s
savings being available for the development of
Australia, the money is being driven away to
help develop some other country. For the Aus-
tralian banks, unable to find any reasonably safe
outlet for the large sums which the last three
good years have brought them, have sent millions
of money to London for temporary investment
there. Meantime, Australia has been importing
the bulk of its requirements in the shape of
manufactured goods. In those three prosperous
years its imports of foreign goods, practically all
manufactures, have amounted to £120,097,079.
Thus, while we have been spending considerable
sums of money in telling people in Europe that
Australia is a good place to emigrate to, we have
been sending millions of money to Europe to
finance the industries which supply us with the
things we need, and to pay in other countries
the wages of the people we say we want here.
So the establishment of manufacturing indus-
tries isn’t only a matter for the workman.
It is a matter also for the man and the
woman who have their much or little to de-
posit at their bank, and who under present condi-
tions can generally get no more than or 3 per
cent, for it, while in the United States, where the
banks have the whole manufacturing require-
ments of the country to finance, the same deposits
command, as a rule, 5 per cent., and frequently
more. Also the establishment of industries is a
matter of personal interest to the insurance
policy-holder, who sees the rate of interest
which his savings can command gradually
shrinking, simply because the industries
which Australian money ought to be financing
are being carried on abroad and financed abroad.
Twenty years ago, to go back no further,
the average rate of interest earned by the A.M.P.
Society was £6 2s. per cent. ; last year it was only
£4 9s. 7d. per cent. And every A.M.P. policy-
holder can be sure of this—that if the Society can’t
earn high interest, it can’t pay high bonuses for
long.
* * * *
The tens of thousands of Australians who are
interested in their banks, building societies, and
other financial concerns are on that account also
interested in another aspect of this same question.
When banks, building societies, and the rest of
them collapsed 14 or 15 years ago, they were
loaded up with many millions of pounds’ worth of
city and suburban properties. By calling up
large amounts of capital, and then writing it off
as lost, they were able to write down these assets
considerably; and at the written-down values
they have been able to pass on large numbers of
properties to others. In thousands of cases de-
positors have taken these properties in lieu of
cash. But thousands of other properties still
remain in the hands of the buildingsocieties, banks,
etc. Where they were country properties they have
mostly been got rid of during the present run of
high prices for grazing and farming land. But
there has been very little movement in city and
suburban properties. “Transactions in real
estate are more numerous, ” the chairman of one
of the Trustee Cos. reported to his shareholders
the other day. “ But the larger demand for real-
property investments is in country districts.
There is not much recovery in the value of town
properties, nor much disposition to invest in
them. This probably arises from the small in-
crease in opportunities of work in our cities,
owing partly to the non-expansion of manufac-
turing enterprise.” That stated the whole fact.
* * * *
These things appeal for effective Protection in a
general way, and as an established policy. But
if Australians aim at being a manufacturing
people, using up in advanced crafts the raw pro-
ducts with which bountiful Fortune has provided
this country, they must build on iron. No country
in the world has become a great industrial hive on
any other foundation. There is a curious argu-
ment that, because iron and steel are the tools
of practically every trade, therefore Australia
should put no duties on iron and steel, or iron and
steel manufactures, lest it should temporarily put
up prices, and put back the other trades. Here
is a frank admission of the fact that iron and steel
are necessary to practically every trade; therefore,
according to this extraordinary theory, which
leaks at every joint, put every Australian industry
at the mercy of the foreigner ! The first principle
in every successful enterprise is—“ Get control of
the necessaries.” A thousand times lately Aus-
tralia has been told to “look to Canada ” —Canada,
the country of High Protection; Canada, the
country which, after a trial to do without it,
resolved that it must have an iron and steel in-
dustry, in spite of the fact that for its smelting-
fuel it had to depend upon charcoal or imported
anthracite; Canada, the country whose Finance
Minister (Tupper) declared in 1887 that the Pro-
tection of the iron industry was “ more important
than all the others”—a statement which can be
found in Professor Fuchs’ “ Trade Policy of Great
Britain,” published in 1905 by MacMillan and
Co. In the same interesting survey, those
Foreign-traders who cheerfully assume that
Great Britain had no Protective duties to build
up its manufacturing greatness may profitably
read that “in 1824 the Protective duties on the
most important manufactures were still between
50 and 80 per cent.” ; while those who reckon
themselves good Protectionists, yet stand in some
awe of 20 per cent, duties, may also profitably
read that, under the “great tariff reform” of
Peel, Freetrader and Corn Law Reformer (1842),
there was “ a systematic reduction of the duties
on wholly manufactured articles to a maximum
of 20 per cent. The duties on silk goods alone
remained unchanged at from 25 to 40 per cent,,
ad valorem , as it was contended that this branch
of industry still needed Protection.”

THE LAST TALLY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
His hard face now is calm and pale,
His lips with a smile are riven ;
Tho’ his body lies in the smellful hold,
His soul is aloft in Heaven.
The Tally Book is laid aside,
The pencil now is blunted ;
The hides come tumbling in the hold,
And none of them are counted.
But let the hides smell on—
They’ll not disturb his rest.
He’s shipped a pair of snow-white wings,
And a gold crown’s on his crest.
But he’s very, very lonely,
Tho’ he is among the Blest;
For he is the only Mate there,
And it makes him sore apprest.
For he sometimes gazes downwards,
And among the brimstone blazes
He sees the Mates of other days
In their appointed places.
And he sees old Skippers roasting
In the hottest spots of Hell
And he would almost pity them
Did he not know them too well.

OR the next twelve
months this page
will be devoted to
telling the people
facts about their
coastal marine, and
the affairs of the Five Companies whose
flags are emblazoned hereon, and whose
fleets make up the greater bulk of that
coastal marine. Very few Australians real-
ise how large a part the steamers of those
Five Companies play in the affairs of their
country. Apart from their value as employers of
labor, spending an enormous sum in wages,
repairs, and for provisions, and so forth, it is the
fleets of the Five Companies that make Australia
one country, and reader the Commonwealth a possi-
bility by linking up the scattered settlements of the
continent into one national whole. It is only when
one remembers that the coastline of Australia
measures 7750 miles (which, if drawn straight, would
reach from Sydney to San Francisco and nearly a
thousand miles beyond it) that the mind begins to
realise what a scattered, wide-spread place Australia
is. Our territories are enormous, and without the
fleets of the Five Companies, or those of some other
companies, the continent would be. split up into a
whole series of small, and comparatively poor, settle-
ments. The fleets of the Five Companies bring them
all into close proximity, and make nationhood
possible. These companies deserve well of Aus-
tralians, and it is to be regretted that instead of rush-
ing off to Europe and the United States to see things,
leisured Australians do not spend more time, explor-
ing the wonders of their own splendid country. It is
well worth seeing.
*32?
Steamers in Australia date back to March 31,
1831, when Henry G. Smith, a London director of
the Commercial Bank of Sydney, placed on
Parramatta River the Surprise. This boat was
afterwards sent to Tasmania. On May 16th of
the same year there steamed into Port Jackson
the Sophia Jane, from England. This
pioneer of the ocean liners was only
256 tons and 50-h.p. There are motor
yachts building in
Australia to-day
which are of
larger dimen-
sions. Lieu-
tenant
Biddulph,
of the
Royal
Navy,
who was
part
owner,
brought it out, and the ship was afterwards placed on
the Newcastle-Sydney run, and thus became the
pioneer of the great fleet of coasting steamers
which cruise round Australia to-day. Curiously
enough, the new ideas met with much oppo-
sition at first, many people refusing to commit
themselves and lives to steamers driven by boilers
and furnaces. However, that soon passed, and on
October 22nd, of the same year, the first locally-
built steamer, William IV., was launched at Williams
River by a builder named J. H. Grose. By J anuary
26th, 1842, steam communication was opened between
Sydney and Brisbane, and the eastern coast of Aus-
tralia was properly linked up by regular steamer ser-
vices. Things have grown since then : at the end of
1901 there were registered in Australia 943 steamers
of 203,541 tonnage.
An interesting and reassuring fact to travellers is
that there are less Wrecks on the Australian coast than
any other part of the world. And what wrecks there
are are chiefly those of oversea steamers and sailing-
ships which get piled up about the entrance to New-
castle. To hear of an Australian coasting steamer
getting wrecked is a rare thing indeed. And ever
since the first steamers began to plough Australian
waters they have been singularly fortunate in this
respect. Also travellers who have been round the
world in both directions have affirmed over and
over again in books, newspapers and magazines,
that the comfort, cuisine, navigation, and general
management of (;he Australian coastal marine are
ahead of those of any other part of the world. This, of
course, is easily explained. No other country uti-
lises its coastal marine to the same extent that
Australia relies on the ships of the Five Companies.
In Australia, the movements are north and south,
east and west, and in every case the road lies over
the waves. It is always around the coast. In the
United States the movement is mostly east and
west—across the country, and the Yankee is
a railroad man, not a sailor. The same
applies in a modified degree to the British Isles.
The man who wants to travel from London to
'Edinburgh takes the Flying Scotchman, or some
Other celebrated train. With the exception of the
traffic to Ireland and across the English Channel the
Englishman travels in fast trains, which reduce
distance by getting the inside running of ships. But
in Australia the man. who would go west must go by
steamer, and the man who starts from Melbourne for
Brisbane or any other part of Queensland invariably
takes a boat. It is more comfortable, and is, in many
cases, the only way. And this natural condition has
caused the directors of the Five Companies to study
passenger traffic as it is studied nowhere else in the
world. Their ships are the main arteries of national
trade—in other countries the ships are the second
line. Therefore, the Australian gets better value for
his money than any other coastal traveller in the
world.
If Australians knew their own country better,
they would spend more time exploring its beauties.
The object of this page is to tell them something
fresh about it every fortnight, with the object of
inducing them to travel in the fleets of the Five
Companies and see what their heritage is like. It
will contain things they ought to know, and
occasionally give accounts of the scenes of
beauty that may be viewed from the decks of
the associated fleets. We have as interesting a
country as any race in the world. The pity is that
we don’t, as a people, know more about it. Geologi-
cally, parts of it are among the oldest fragments of
the earth’s surface above water, and can supply the
tourist with interesting observations, obtainable in
no other part the world. To the bulk of the
people living in it Australia is .still the Land of
Mystery that it was before the coming of the English.
Henry VIII. sat on the throne of England when
some little Dago craft came up against some part of
the north or nor’-western coast, and returning
spread the news that the mysterious southern land
of which Marco Polo, the Venetian traveller, 200
years before, told Rusticiano of Pisa he had heard of
while in China, and which was described as a great
round island, larger than even the Flowery Land
itself, which lay beyond Java. It must be remembered
that the Chinese traded regularly to Java. Also, the
old Phoenicians, who sailed and paddled down the Red
Sea, away along the. shores of Asia till the Malay
Peninsula blocked further progress, had heard of it,
and occasionally made maps, in which its northern
fringe was represented as balanced accurately on the
back of a tortoise, or some similar creature.
That northern and nor’-western coast-line is
still almost entirely unknown. The Malay prahu
still haunts its creeks and navigable rivers, and
it is whispered that Chinese junks,
those weird crafts of. bamboo fitted
with great latyen l sails, are running
passenger lines to a terminus
somewhere about the English
Company Isles. For a fas-
cinating trip, that along the
Queensland coast, “ where
the coral grows and the
pearls lie deep,” is
unsurpassable. It
can be taken at
verylittlecost, and
on one of the float-
ing hotels of the
Five Companies
can be enjoyed
with all the aids
of civilisation.
The sea-kings of
old were not in it
with the Aus-
tralian tourist of
to-day.

Every child suffers more or less from
intestinal worms. Indeed many adults are
troubled with this complaint, but fail to realise
the fact. The symptoms of this trouble are
various, but are usually very pronounced.
Constant irritation of the nostrils and the biting
of the finger nails are sure signs of the presence of
worms. Invariably the sleep is greatly disturbed
with grinding of the teeth, and an excessive flow
of saliva. Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worms

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Ideal weather, twenty odd thousand spectators,
ahd a gate worth, in round figures, £lOOO, greeted Pro-
fessional Football’s first appearance in Sydney. The
Maorilanders were a fine-looking set of men, much
superior in appearance, decency and honesty of play to
the amateur All Blacks. There was no elbow work in the
line-out, the scrums were managed with absolute fairness,
and the off-side tactics which disgraced the amateurs were
conspicuous by their absence. The game was a fair lest
Cf Rugby football, and not a struggle to score points by
any and every means whatever. The result was that the
professional team made a good impression on spectators
and opponents alike.
The match itself was a first-class exhibition,
full of interest from start to finish. Both teams were
suffering from lack of combination, due to not having
plkyed together, but as the game went on they improved
greatly in this respect. The Maorilanders gave some
splendid exhibitions of dribbling, and the passing charges
of the N.S.W. three-quarter line were fine. Messenger
eclipsed himself ; he took marks right off the very toes of
the All Blacks, turning their splendid dribbling rushes to
a source of danger, and kicked from the half-way line only
to miss the bar by inches. He seemed to anticipate
the movements of the Blacks in a manner that
suggested thought reading, and when what seemed the
unexpected came off, Messenger was in the right place to
nip it in the bud. Graves, Mable, and Fry, other Blues,
also made fine passing charges. The weak spot in the
home team was the half-back line ; its component parts
frequently forgot that they were there only to feed the
three-quarter line, and tried to break away themselves.
The packs were about equal, although that of the Blacks
had the advantage of strength. The Maoriland full-back,
Turtill, is a gem of the first water, and a man who doesn’t
make mistakes. His kicking is quick as lightning, and
as cool as the proposal that N.S.W. should select the
Australian capital. The N.S.W. full back, Hedley, is also
excellent, but he is not the imposing monster that
Turtill is.
The game commenced with a great struggle
midfield, the players swaying from one side of the ground
to the other, neither making any progress till Messenger
secured, charged, and kicked to the M.L. 25. The
Blacks carried it into N.S.W. territory, and failed at a
field goal. Messenger, rushing it back, took a drop at
goal, and compelled the Blacks to force. A few minutes
later they were again compelled to force. Another drib-
bling rush put the Blues on the defensive, and a shot at
a field goal compelled N.S.W. to force. A series of splen-
did passing charges by both sides filled the spectators
with excitement, which boiled over when Messenger, a
few feet from half-way, barely missed a penalty goal.
Instead of forcing, the Blacks charged and kicked, and
the Blue who took it ran instead of marking, and the ball
being fumbled, the Blacks got the first chance. They
took it, and the score was M.L. three ; t’others nil.
Shortly afterwards Messenger took another shot at
goal from right on the half-way line, and missed
by inches. It was an amazing kick ! The Blacks
stopped a Blue rush in their own territory, and wrench-
ing the ball away carried it right down the field over the
line, making the score six to nil. The Blues attacked
again, and a great struggle was in progress on the M.L.
25 when Messenger suddenly secured the ball, and burst-
ing,through scored a try, which he failed to convert on
account of the angle. When the whistle sounded the
Blues were in full sail for the line. The second half
opened with a struggle on the M.L. 25 line, and Messen-
ger dashed away, but finding himself unsupported kicked
for a field goal. M. L. saved by forcing. A passing ch arge
and a line kick by Messenger were followed up with line
kicking, till Messenger took a mark. The Blacks blocked
his kick, but Messenger stopped their rush by coolly
kicking out while his guernsey was being torn off his
back. As the Blacks came away from the line-out he
again marked, but the angle was too great and the shot
at goal failed. The Blacks dribbled right through the
Waters, but were stopped inside the 25. Here bad play
gave them a mark right in front of goal, and the
score became nine to three. Messenger ran to the
M.L. 25, and centred, and fell on Todd before he
could return, and out of the loose Gann scored :
Messenger converted, and lifted the N.S.W. score to eight
to nine. The excitement became intense. A vigorous
dribbling charge by the Maorilanders was only momen-
tarily blocked in N.S.W. 25, but the Blue three-quarter
failed to gather in his opportunity, and the Maorilanders
gob across and won by 12 to eight.
Not the least creditable part of the match was
the refereeing. Mr. Boss acted right up to his name.
When unsatisfied with the way the ball was pub into the
scrum, although writer could see nothing wrong, he put
it in himself. As a referee there are points about Mr.
Boss. If the professionals continue to play as they did
on Saturday, the Rugby Union is right up against some-
thing very formidable. As before mentioned, the takings
were, in round figures, £lOOO. The critical time will come
with the division of the money between the conflicting
interests. If that can be carried out without causing
ructions, the Union may have to choose between cutting
loose from the English body and going up the spout.
*.* * *
That the N.S.W. so-called professional football
movement was more or less justifiable is proved by the
Union’s proposal, made before the League has properly
started, to liberalise the conditions under which amateurs
play. But, all the same, it is still proposed to fall hea\4ly
on the men who, by their secession, have brought about
the admittedly necessary reform. It is just as though an
employer, when his men had gone on strike, said : “ Yes,
I’ll pay higher wages, and make the conditions better all
round, but I’ll employ blacklegs ; the men who have
brought this reform about shall never work for me again,
nor have any share in the benefits they have created.”
Either the movement is justifiable, or it is not. If it is,
the Union should set its house in order, and declare an
amnesty. If it isn’t, then the Union should stand firm,
and make no “concessions.” This paper’s opinion is
that the movement is justifiable, only it doesn’t like the
men who have started it—Victor Trumper, one of the
cricket crowd that tried to euchre the Board of Control,
and assist the Melbourne Cricket Club to boss the game ;
Kelly, of the same gang, and others.
* ■* m * ,
The old stock phrases of the “ Great Freetrade
and Liberal Party” might have been used in their entirety
to describe the upheaval of the Eastern Suburbs footballers
on Saturday. Theclub that seemed to be an absolute wreck,
owing to the defections to the pros., pulled itself together
in a marvellous manner, made a recovery, and proved
that the great natural resources of this institution were
beyond the wildest dreams of its admirers. Certainly
they were beyond the dreams of the unfortunate
Western Suburbs, on whom the recoverers proved
their mettle by 16 points to nil. Starting against
the wind the Easterns played a solidly defensive game
the whole of the first half, which was scoreless, and in
the second half, with the wind behind them, they stormed
the Western line repeatedly, scoring two goals and two
unconverted tries. Next week East will meet Glebe at
Sydney Cricket Ground in the semi-final, and it will pro-
bably be a wildly exciting struggle. University defeated
North Sydney by 21 points to 17. At the start
it looked as though the hillmen were going to get
the father and mother of a hiding, but they livened
up amazingly, though they had to play one man short
owing to Gardiner having broken a finger. He was full
of sand, and wanted to play on, but his captain ordered
him off the field. He left reluctantly. Glebe-Sydney
match was a struggle between the opposing forwards,
which resulted in a victory for the butchers by nine
points to three, while South Sydney and Newtown played
a draw with 11 points each.
The result is that the beaten clubs and Newtown
drop out of the competition. Newtown played its last
chance on Saturday, and failed to improve its position.
The semi-final takes place on Saturday, when Eastern
Suburbs will meet Glebe at the Cricket Ground, and
South Sydney and University will battle at University
Oval. The two winners will play off on Saturday week.
On points Glebe is leading with a competition score of 20
points, and University and Eastern Suburbs are together
in the second rank with 19 points each. South Sydney is
fourth with 16.

N.S.W. Soccer ’bailers are now struggling for
the Gardiner Cup, and, owing to brevity of time, the com-
petition is being run on sudden death lines. The team
that goes down is blown out for ever, as Omar Khayyam
would say. An unfortunate country club —Weston, of
the Maitland District—had the misfortune to meet the
invincible Pyrmont; yet it put up an amazing
struggle. So strenuously did it fight for possession
of the ball that the premier club only won by
two goals to nil. ,Navy met Broadmeadow, and went
under by three to nil. The remaining match of the
day was that between Balmain and Rozelle, at Epping
(Sydney). It was a great contest, and consisted of
a series of charges and counter charges, with every man
on the field going at top speed. But the goal-keepers on
both sides were too solid, and after a heavy struggle the
whistle sounded on a scoreless draw. These two clubs
will meet again next Saturday, as one or the other has to
be killed in the first round.
* * * *
Anyone with a capacity for explaining the
unaccountable and accounting for the inexplicable could
have got a day’s work in Melbourne after Saturday’s
League matches were decided. It was the commence-
ment of the second round, and each of four clubs hap-
pened to meet one two steps further down the premier-
ship ladder. Each score, at the finish, gave a decided
advantage to one team, yet in every case that team was
the one that ought on “form” to have been walloped.
Carlton met South, and up to three-quarter time held a
steady lead of six points. Immediately on resuming it
scored another goal and began to shake hands with it-
self, but the tireless Southerners settled down to a finish
that, completely rattled the Blue-and-Whites, and in 20
minutes piled on five goals two behinds while the others
could add but threebehinds. This left “Skinner’s hire-
ling’s ” 17 points to the good. The ’Wood-Saints discus-
sion was expected to be so one-sided that scarcely 12,000
people turned up to barrack. It was one-sided, but
the unexpected side was on top at the finish—the Mag-
pies having apparently forgotten all they knew about the
game during the week, while the Saints had recovered
the form which, in the early part of the season, made
them the most talked-about team of all the foot-
ball herd. The scores (Saints, 8-19 ; ’Wood, 3-8) are more
unaccountable than excusable. Melbourne, which met
Essendon, and Geelong, which encountered ’Roy, had
still chances of semi-final honors, could they manage to
win ; but they couldn’t. Now their opponents had no
chances of getting into the finals, in any case, and their
wins could do them no real good, and they were just
winning out of cussedness, and the two superior teams, as
they saw their hopes being blasted, got very, very angry,
and played accordingly. Essendon won by 71 points to
56, and ’Roy by 88 to 38. The latter discussion, being
supervised by a determined umpire, was kept within
bounds; but the Essendon-Melbourne disturbance
speedily became a mere rough-and-tumble, and the game
was stopped several times till individual players had
rebuked each other on the nose. Once the matches were
stopped a full five minutes while half the players en-
gaged in a willing, general scrap. Weak umpiring was
also responsible for a couple of chic little mills at the
’Wood-Saints disturbance. So incompetent has League
football umpiring become that there is now a demand
that Crapp shall be brought over from “ the West ”
specially to umpiie the final matches, but the League is
hardly likely to notice that request. Possibly, if that
body increased the central umpire’s fee and tested new
men more freely, it might presently strike a few who
understand the game and care not a cent for any player,
barracker or club in the State. But a competent umpire
is much harder to find than a star ’bailer.
In the Association Melbourne’s chief interest
centred in Brunswick, which met the once invincible
Essendon (A) team and sent it home cogitating deeply,
the skill of the half-dozen ex-League stars being of no
avail against the systematic play which the brickmakers
have learned from their ex-Collingwood coach. The awful
North managed to score three points more than Preston,
which victory removes its name from the bottom of the
list ; though, as there are only its Saturday’s victims be-
tween it and the abyss, the circumstance is nothing to brag
about. The star clubs, Williamstown and West, collided,
with moderately disastrous results to the latter—s-11 to
5-6 being the tally. West, premier team last year, is hereby
adjured to hump itself, or it will assuredly retire from
business when the semi-final draw is made three weeks
hence. Richmond, having won nine matches in succes-
sion, begins to fancy itself—and very nearly fell in at
Port Melbourne. “ Ports ” have had one of their best
players disqualified for life, and are a very angry lot just
now, and lay themselves out to put the equivalent of the
beginning of wisdom into all and sundry. As one
of the team, in the course of a “diversion”
during Saturday’s game, biffed a boundary umpire
on the countenance, he may possibly follow his
club mate into retirement. If anyone wants to
wallow in gore and language he should pervade the
Port ground next Saturday week, when Essendon (A)
comes along to argue the point. Essendon was respon-
sible for the above-mentioned player’s disqualification,
and the Port barrackers haven’t forgotten the circum-
stance. Footscray, which still has a fragile chance for
the semi-finals, and is piling up points to that end, made
a painful exhibition of Prahran, with a score of 101 points
to 26. The struggles of the moderately good teams to do
great deeds when said deeds are of little avail are a be-
lated and sorrowful thing.

“ Nulla ” : The spirit firm that offered a £5 prize
for every field goal kicked in the recent Australia-
Maoriland match didn’t stand to pay out much, for goal-
kicking, nowadays, is almost as the arts of ancient
Damascus. T’other Saturday, for instance, out of a total
of 32 tries registered in Sydney first-grade Rugby only
seven were converted, and of those no less than four
were booted by the fleet-hoofed Messenger. As for the
dropped goal—that brilliant flash which of old often
dragged a match out of the mire—well, it is about as
scarce as an honest surplus. For the whole of the first-
class matches in Sydney this season field goals can be
almost counted on one’s thumbs, and, in fact, so far as
Australia is concerned, Rugby football might almost be
defined as a game of ball in which the feet don’t take a
hand.

Maoriland is taking sculler Webb’s champion-
ship with desperate seriousness. His native Wanganui
has started a “ national subscription ” to buy him a free-
hold residence, and £l6O was put up at the initial meet-
ing. Which is a solid return for the reflected glory that
is Wanganui’s. When the Canadian runner Shaddock
or Maddock or Haddock won the big event at the Greek
Olympic Games, a couple of years ago, his native city,
Hamilton, presented him with £lOOO, a freehold house, and
a permanent Customs billet, and asked him, “ for the per-
manent glory of his town,” to race no more. He didn’t,
so the town owns an unbeaten champion, and will keep
his bones for all time.

N.S.W. Pioneer Motor Boat Club is not show-
ing the usual activity of the pioneer, and badly wants
shaking up. Practically only one function has been
decently organised and carried out, and that was the
opening of the club’s first season at Clifton Gardens, ’way
back at the beginning of last summer. That was a sight
worth going far to see, but it has never been repeated,
and there are no indications that it will. Yet there are
big possibilities ahead of a motor boat club. The present
organisation wants developing both as regards social club
outings and control of racing. Among the first things
that should be done is the adoption of the U.S.A.
formula for defining horse-power of racing engines. .The
horse-power developed under the rules of the British
Royal Automobile Club, which have been adopted by the
U.S.A. manufacturers and racing authorities, and that at
which engines are listed by their makers, are very dif-
ferent. Just at present the N.S.W. club contains some
of the fastest boats in the world —in proportion to
horse-power—if the power announced to the world is
correct.

So far, there is no word from Mort’s Dock re
the building of a fast Australian boat to hold the
championship of the Southern Ocean and Australasia.
This splendidly-equipped establishment certainly ought
to build a boat that would sweep Sydney Harbor. It is the
success of its fast cars and its fast boats that has made
the mighty Napier Co. Nobody hears a word of the
Napier Co. in advertisements, but not a sporting paper
can one pick up without seeing in the news columns the
name Napier. Now it is a Napier boat that, with a
damaged shaft, has captured the Pearl of the Mediter-
ranean, and then it is a Napier six-cylinder car that has
run 65 miles an hour for 24 hours without pause or
slackening. And there is no reason why it should not be
in all the Australasian papers that the Mort’s Dock boat,
fitted with Invincible engines, swept the board at the
N.S.W. Motor Boat Club’s meeting on such and such a
date, or that the Mort’s Dock boat, fitted with Invincible
engines, beat the best foreign-engined boats at some
European carnival. There is no earthly reason why
Mort’s Dock shouldn’t argue the point in the Mediter-
ranean as well as any other concern. Practically there
would be no Invincible engines but for the fact that
Relph’s splendid boat made an Australian industry pos-
sible. It is the best sort of advertisement, and turns
every man who takes an interest in the sport into an
active and whole-souled canvasser. It is the duty of the
great Dock to build that boat—a duty it owes to itself
and the nation.

A field of 95 faced the starter at Bathurst for
the long ride of 133£ miles to Sydney, promoted by the
Wallace-Continental Rubber Co. The event was under
the control of the N.S.W. League of Wheelmen. The
first man left Bathurst at 6.55 a.m., and by 8 o’clock the
scratch men had been sent off. The whole pack struck
trouble six miles outside Sunny Corner, some fiend or
idiot having amused himself by sowing tacks along the
road. The way the riders gathered in those tacks was
just marvellous. The road is a hilly one, and the
men made the pace a flyer from the start,
so much so that those tacks at Sunny Corner were an
absolute godsend to some exhausted riders, whose chances
were nil. But about 30 men were deprived of a real
chance of winning, through this outrage. At 8.52 a.m.
H. L. Orr tore through Sunny Corner like a whirlwind-
tacks and all —and behind streamed a small army of
gasping, sweating riders. At Mt. Victoria the first sign
of their coming was Tumbers, with his head down, and
his legs toiling furiously. And always close behind the
leader, whoever the leader might be, the brothers Aplin
split through the atmosphere. At Katoomba there was
no defined leader, but a bunch of three struggling
to get a break on the field, with the brothers
Aplin running close behind. At Parramatta Wal-
cott was 50yds. in front, with a pained expression on
his face that indicated he was worried by the close
proximity of the brothers Aplin. Six miles from the
finish the frequently-mentioned brothers Aplin drew up
and went like wind." Walcott responded, and a desperate
race ensued, and 4000 people roared with excitement as,
150yds. from home, Walcott and the two brothers Aplin
(who keep coming into this story even after the
repetition of their names has become a weariness) fought
out the finish. It looked like being a dead heat of
three. But a few yards from the tape one brother
Aplin (F.) lifted his machine, and came away. The
other brother Aplin (A.) followed, and Walcott who
was exhausted by having practically made the pace for
many weary miles, could not respond. They finished in
that' order, with inches between the brothers Aplin, and
Walcott only half a wheel behind the second. F. Aplin
won £5O first prize, £3 3s. for second fastest time, and £7
for using Continental tyres ; total £6O 3s. A. Aplin
raked in a bicycle and £7 ss. in-eash, while plucky Wal-
cott won only a measly bike for third place. Which was
hard luck for Walcott.
Of course the real champion in a contest of this
sort is the man who covers the distance in the shortest
actual riding time. This proud position was awarded to
G. Horder, whose time worked out almost as fast as that
of a train. He was on scratch, and arrived fourth, having
done the journey in 7hr. 30min. Ofsee. The train, when
it runs to time, takes 6hr. 27min. However, Mon-
day brought a protest against Horder in his capacity
as the swiftest flyer, the plaintiff being H. Lundie,
who finished fifth. He alleged that Horder was paced by
F. S. Hagney from Penrith to Burwood, and declared he
had several witnesses to prove his allegation. The affair
was to have been decided on Tuesday night, after this
paper had gone to press. The man who sowed the tacks
rather overdid it; he bought such a quantity as to make
it almost impossible to miss tracing him, and when the
League does run him to earth he is going to strike serious
trouble.

This is the day of the female. A married lady
named Riley, who drove a 20 h.p. Belsize (shod with
Dunlop tyre’s), has wbn the Scottish Reliability Trial, the
crack annual motor event of Great Britain. Besides
scoring the most points, the lady also carried off the
special gold medal for the best all-round performance.
The course was 747 miles, and the field 96 cars. This is
the first occasion on which a lady has taken the glory and
the whoop and the profits.

“ All About Dunlop Tyres for 1907-8 ” is now
to hand from the Dunlop Rubber Go., and contains 36
pages crammed full of interesting and useful information
re the use and management of the pneumatic tyre of the
country, for the Dunlop tyre is an Australian production,
and one of which the country has every reason to be
proud. The booklet is artistically illustrated and beauti-
fully printed.* -
The first meeting of the Southland Coursing
Club at Invercargill (M.L.) on the 7th and Bth of the
present month afforded some cheerful sport—cheerful
from the standpoint of the brute who calls himself a
coursing enthusiast. Twelve hundred people rolled up
and had their fill of butchery. The Post of Wellington
reported : “ The hares did not know the escapes, and it
was a veritable slaughter, only 20 hares being- left. It is
probable that the Open Stakes will be abandoned.” The
Times said : “ Kills were too frequent.. .. and the supply
of hares ran out, leaving both events unfinished. The
stakes were consequently divided amongst the owners of
dogs still left in.” Why not put it briefly: “The stakes
were divided among the hogs left in.”
There’s a growing impression that three months’
hard without the option would be a fair thing for some
of the ruffians who managed to get into the Canadian
lacrosse team. Possibly, so long as a man can play
lacrosse, nothing else matters in Canada. The Australian
authorities are understood to have made a careful note of
certain names with a view to requesting the governing
body in Canada to exclude them from any team that may
come here in the future. Our men went on the field to
play lacrosse, and not to indulge in free fights and be
kicked, tripped, prodded and bashed with the crosses. If
the visitors wanted fight, they should have said so before
going on the field, and then they could have been accom-
modated, but they ought in common fairness to let the
Australians know'exactly what they are looking for.
The prediction in last issue of a better day
coming: for Dyed Garments was fulfilled on Saturday,
when the son of Malvolio won the August Handicap at
Flemington in good style. If Dyed Garments were an
easily-trained animal his present “ form ” wi uld give him
an excellent show to take one or other of the Cups, but
his periods of fitness are not frequent or long-sustained,
and he is likely to be in a tired mood when the big events
come due. A less-expected victory last Saturday was
that of Booran. The champion second-class three-year-
old of last season was probably riper than his people
thought him. Starting at 10 to 1, he scored a brilliant
win from perhaps half-a-dozen triers. This is a time of
the year when the market price of some of the starters
should be 1000 to one, and the stewards of the V.R.C. are
mostly addicted to winking the other eye after every
race. They must have opened both eyes when Booran
flashed in.

And yet there are apparently enough fools over there to
keep the bookmakers going. Marvellous what a lot of
fools there are abroad in this world. On the same day, at

Tim Hegarty, long featherweight champion of
Australia, and still unbeaten at 9st., came into the game
again at Melbourne pavilion the other night to demon-
strate emphatically that youth will have its way. Frank
Thorn, his opponent, had youth and cleverness. Hegarty
had age and ability, but his energies were not equal to a
20-round engagement, and after 10 rounds, in which he
showed fine style, particularly in evasion, he broke up.
Although he stood out the time it was mainly through
hanging desperately to Thorn’s neck for two minutes out
of every three. Tim certainly went into the ring this
trip with the intention of rehabilitating himself, but he
was up against it. Thorn was an easy winner on points.

“Bill” Squires writes that “there is nothing
much to say about the fight. . . . Burns landed on me
first, and I never got over it till he hit me right out. It
was a disappointing go. I have gone a bit off, and no
doubt the other man is under-rated.” He was, especially
by William, who, according to Barney Wrenolds, “ en-
tered the ring confident of success, looked on Burns with
supreme contempt, charged him, missed him, charged
and missed again, charged again, received a right,
and fell dazed and helpless. He would not stay down,
but rose, rushed, and threw the money in the fire.”
At latest Squires was “ going north ” to belt something
that wouldn’t hit back—timber, to wit. Which, though
useful work, isn’t quite up to Squires’ size in belting jobs.
Burns notwithstanding.

The most frantic fight ever seen in Melbourne
under alleged Marquis Queensberry rules was that of
“ Props ” Reader, of Sydney, versus Tom Fennessey, of
Melbourne. These two slugging heavies know the game
well, and realise what is what and what what is, but
finding themselves under a referee who, to put it gently,
had lost his presence of mind, they turned the “glove
contest ” into a Kilkenny-cat fight. Referee and fighters
were mixed up inextricably together, rolling over and
over, both men pounding the referee under the impres-
sion it was the other fellow that was taking it all.
On one occasion Reader threw Fennessey, and after
bumping him gently on the floor, turned him over on his
back, and sat on his chest while he took a breather and
the ovations of the crowd. Both men were down as
often as they were up, if not oftener. The wear and tear
told most on Reader, who, finding his strength gone,
hung on in spite of all orders to break away. Whereupon
the referee, suddenly remembering who he was, declared
Fennessey the winner. The gintleman with the French
name will now be matched with Mr. Joe Cullen.

Said that under the rules of the English North-
ern Union line kicking is not allowed, and when the
ball goes out of bounds, the side that is responsible is
penalised. If this is correct, it will break the heart of
the Maorilanders, with whom good line kicking is a fine
art.

Anticipated that there will be 250 starters for
the Warrnambool to Melbourne race this year. The
Dunlop Rubber Co., which controls the race, has decided
to establish another feeding station, where the cyclists
will grab delicacies to keep them up. It will be located
on the hill just' after leaving Colac, 73 miles from Mel-
bourne. Entries positively close with the Dunlop Co.,

Ex-Maorilander Dick Arnst looms big in the
sculling world. Within the last couple of months he has
challenged about six of the alleged cracks, and one and
all have side-stepped him. So now Richard has
announced that he will reach for the scalp of the winner
of the Webb-Tressider match, and go straight for the
championship of the world without any preliminaries.

N.S.W. has finished its struggle with unregis-
tered bike racing, and fairly stamped the thing out; but
in Victoria the fight is only just beginning. Quite a
number of unregistered meetings are held in Bent’s
State, and, what is more, they pay the promoters well.
Just at present the Sale-Prospect £l5O Handicap is being
announced.as an unregistered event, and the League is
beginning to wonder how to go about stopping the thing.
As good a way as any would be to hire Mclntosh for six
months. .

The‘Weight* Question
In (he weight of a bicycle there exists a
point where safety is assured.
Every ounce beyond that point is super-
fluous and means wasted energy.
Every ounce of that superfluous weight
cut off, means increased ease of propulsion.
In a cycle built of
EADIE FITTINGS
the point of safety is assured—not by a
clumsy addition of weight, but by the use
of the finest material procurable the
knowledge of expert designers—and the
most scientific methods of production.
Thus are secured the three essentials—
STRENGTH—LIGHTNESS—RIGIDITY

Died at Maryborough (Q.), on August 3,
aged 85, John Walker, who, in conjunction with
James Wood, Thomas Braddock, and W. F.
Harrington, established the firm of John Walker
and Cos., now Walkers, Limited. In its day
it was a fine concern, and may be again;
but under the recent tariff it has had such a bad
time that it was nearly worth while rechristening
it Limpers, Ltd.
George Black has been nominated by the
P.L.L. to contest Carruthers’ electorate, of St.
George, at the N.S.W. State election. Probably
he won’t win, but he should keep Carruthers in
the neighborhood of his own cavern during the
next few weeks, for which he will have the
gratitude of every section of the State —always
barring St. George. And, this being a world
much given to the unexpected, he may win, for
George Black is a political fighter of no mean
tonnage.
“ Wingen ” Abbott, president of the
Pastoralists’ Union, has been stirred up to his
Old letter-writing habit by the Australian Arbitra-
tion Court’s award in the shearers’ case. “A 20
per cent, increase ! ” he moans—“ it is terrible.”
Not that the pastoralists can’t afford it—they
can. They could afford, he admits, anything up
to 25 per cent. But it ought to have been
gradual; it ought to have been “spread over a
series of years”; “Justice O’Connor was not
justified in putting up the wages rate 20 per cent,
in one jump without first trying what a less
revolutionary measure would effect.” In fact,
nobody should do the right thing all at once.
Now, “a bad year may necessitate a very large
reduction in the rate ” ; and “Will such a state of
things be conducive to peace?” asks Wingen,
with pains in his pen. No; alas, no! On the
same principle “Wingen” Abbott is no doubt
selling his wool at the old rate of sd. instead of
the new Is. Id. rate. He sees the danger of col-
lecting the extra Bd.; if he collected this
year he mightn’t be able to get it next year, and.
that might lead to “Wingen” and the buyer
having words. So he only collects the old sd. Or,
perhaps, s|d. —on the principle that the thing
ought io be done gradually.
“Lone Hand” holdeth forth :
“ Vigil,” in his letter (B. 8/8/’O7), is excitedly inaccurate
in some of his statements. It was only a section—and a
very small section at that—of the Melbourne Patent
Attorneys, who complained of the administration of the
Commisssioner of Patents. The majority—and a large
majority at that—of the Melbourne attorneys recognise
that the Commissioner has had an extremely difficult
task in the organisation of the Patents, Designs and Trade
Marks Department, and in the administration of the re-
spective Acts of Parliament. This majority, being
reasonable men, consider that the administration of such
Acts—although not perfect—has been performed by the
•Commissioner as well, satisfactorily and conscientiously
as mortal man could have done. Another point: Con-
sidering that on an average between forty and fifty
patent applications are lodged every week ori inventions
•of electrical, metallurgical, agricultural, and other
widely different natures, “Vigil’s ” suggestion of having
owe expert to frame the inventors’ specifications is about
as sensible as most otherof his remarks. Scores of experts,
draughtsmen and typists, together with agents and
staffs in other countries, would have to be appointed for
the purpose of protecting the “ inventions ” of all the
hare-brained individuals who come along. If “ Vigil ”
will visit one or two of the Patent Attorneys—or get an
opinion from the Commissioner—he will find that the
attorneys well earn the fees they receive. These fees
are, in simple cases, considerably lower than stated by
“ Vigil,” whereas the Government fees on every applica-
tion, whether, it be for a pin or a steam-engine, are £8 ;
so “Vigil ” has been barking at the moon. If, after
making enquiries, “Vigil” is not convinced that inven-
tors get their money’s worth for services, I would advise
him to change his medical adviser.
Edward Wyatt Wickham, who was ad-
mitted to the N.S.W. Bar last Thursday, has
been 18 years in the Public Service, being now
Chief Clerk under the Commonwealth and State
Arbitration Acts. The Wickhams are ah ancient
family in the Ma State. Eighty years ago they
were at Maitland, and a few years later one of
them held an official position at Hyde Park Bar-
racks, Sydney. Eventually most of the Wick-
hams were to be found in Parramatta, where the
mother of the family was post-mistress. Another
member was Town Clerk of Parramatta for about
a quarter of a century, in the days when the
feuds between the Taylors and the Byrnes and
their friends made wild and woolly circus in the
council of the now peaceful little town.
Victorian Statist Drake has just issued his
wheat-area statistics for 1907-8. He shows that
there is an actual shrinkage in the area under crop
in Victoria this year compared with last year—
-2,263,301 acres last year; 2,133,000 acres this
year. In the whole of the Western District there
is only one county—Ripon—with enough land
under crop to be worth including in the detailed
statistics; and even Ripon is down for a miser-
able 69,800 acres, which is actually about 3000
acres less than it was the previous year. Evi-
dently, in the absence of a progressive land-tax,
the absurd prices demanded—whether you rent
land or buy it—have driven men out of the State.
They have got sick of working for the landlord
and the mortgagee.
“ Spring” : A feature of the recent brief
and last session of N.S.W. Parliament was the
resplendency of Ashburnham’s Eden George.
George has such style and grace that it is little
wonder he became a photo man. There is about
him an air of shopman-like superiority that is
immense ; his very feet seem to murmur “ Kindly
step this way.” He is the cheap tailor’s noblest
work. There are three politicians always engaged
facing the camera in this country —Willie Kelly,
B. Smith and Eden George; and of these the
greatest is Eden George. The Ashburnham
electors would do well to enthuse a little more
over their splendid rep. What does an ill-used,
miserable old State want with good men, when it
can get sleek men? What need to search for
brainy men, when shiny men are offering them-
selves broadcast ?
“ Mate ” writes :
The new Navigation Bill, that is to enforce local condi-
tions on foreign ships trading on our coast, will need to
be very explicit, or the English shipowner will wriggle
out of it as far as the higher wages are concerned.
A few years ago there was a ship trading here on time
charter. The crew had an agreement for coasting wages,
drawn up by a lawyer and signed by the master. A
note of this was entered in the official log. Still un-
satisfied, they had the increased rate of pay entered on
the articles, signed by the master of the ship and the
shipping master in one of our ports.
When the charter expired the ship went to a Mediter-
ranean port. The original articles having expired, the
crew were sent to England, to be paid on arrival there.
The owner repudiated the agreement for Australian
coastal wages while on time oharter, claiming that the
master had exceeded his powers. The men took the case
to Court and lost. Of course, the master was the one
they should have gone for, but he was still abroad with
the ship in the Mediterranean. The extra wages
amounted to over £6O each man.
Another case I know of was that of a mate whose extra
wages, for coasting, amounted to about £l2O. The
owners demanded that he should surrender this as the
price of keeping his billet. He held out for a time, and
finally compromised by giving up £75.
Within a week, he was accused of drunkenness, and
dismissed.
Foreign ships trading on the Australian coast should be
compelled to pay wages monthly. Otherwise, all the
seamen will see of the coastal wages will be the tail of the
remuneration disappearing round the corner.
N. S. W. Government recently erected
several workmen’s residences on the Rocks
(Sydney) resumed area, and the houses are now
letting well. To people who were accustomed to
moulder in the dingy dog-kennels provided by
“Private Enterprise,” the modern, well-appointed
State dwellings are a Paradise. Premier Carru-
thers is so pleased with the way things have
turned out that he is going to proceed further,
and build shops on the resumed land in George-
street North. For a Premier who is so staunchly
Anti-Sosh, Carruthers is making considerable
headway in State Socialism. The peculiar thing
is that Carruthers finds that State Socialism pays,
which it shouldn’t do, according to the doctrine
of the people he associates with.
Spruce Myth will really have to go to
England to tell the British Parliament to stop its
beastly interference with Private Enterprise, and
to live up to the Australian Tory idea of it as a
perfect pattern of Anti-Sosh. Now it has just
gone and passed an Advertisements Regulation
Act, which gives the Government power to
remove any hoarding, placard, etc., which, by
reason of its size or interference with the beauties
of Nature, has become the same sort of a nuisance
that Sydney Harbor has impatiently suffered
under ever since it was discovered, or thereabouts.
N.S.W. State politics have reached their
correct level up Bathurst way, where Bill Young,
M.L.A., whose political views are a deep and
murky mystery, bases his claim to a renewal of
the people’s confidence mainly on the fact that
he has got £IOOO spent on the constituency. To
this his opponent, a Deform person named
Miller, makes reply by assuring the Bathurst
electors that if they but return him he will wrest
considerably more than £IOOO out of Carruthers
to prop up the dejected old town. Also, argues
Miller, the man Young has already had £2BOO
from the country by way of screw, while he
(Miller) has had nothing. Also, Young having
got £IOOO for Bathurst, has probably about ex-
hausted his begging capacity, while he (Miller) is
quite fresh.
Out of £90,000 due as rent from private
landlords for the use of closed roads and State-
owned water frontages, under Victoria’s fairly
recent Act, only some £26,000 has been collected.
Cameron’s Works Department is responsible for
the gathering in of road and frontage rents,' and
does the work on conventional lines. Struggling
selectors and village settlers are generally made
to pay up, while many big landowners are
allowed to blankly ignore the department’s little
bill. Two M.’sL.C. are in possession of miles of
State river frontage and unused State roads in
Gippsland, and for these they have declined on
principle to pay anything. Summonses were to
be issued against them, but instructions came
from the Department to withhold proceedings
“till further notice.” There was no further
notice up to time of writing. One of these cases
involves 23 miles, or 300 acres of water frontage.
There are weird tales, too, of how small men are
charged 18s. per acre per annum for the use of
the State’s river banks or closed roads, while large
men are only asked 3s. per acre for as good or
better land. If a Labor Government displayed
such glaring favoritism, how long would it be
before the Tory press raised the cry of “corrup-
tion ” ?
Bruce Smith again notifies that he will not
accept the additional £2OO a year as member
of the Representatives. Notwithstanding a
general plausibleness of manner, there is
in Smith more cynicism to the square
inch than in any other man in Australian
political life. He was something extra-large
and plausible in the way of patriots when
payment of members was proposed in N.S.W.,
and threw many bouquets at himself for his firm
had just hit himself in the eye with the last posy
when he found himself taking the money. Pro-
bably the smooth old cynic will find the same
thing happen to him again.
Master-mariner Charles L. Gittins came
...... , , , . . -r,
to total shipwreck last week, aged lO years,
About 60 of these numerous years he had spent
trading on the N.S.W. coast. Gittins had many
adventures on and in the great deep, and could
remember being in seven shipwrecks. Three
times he was master of the wrecked vessel. Two
small ketches which he skippered were run down
and sunk in a matter of seconds when entering
Sydney Harbor. On the occasion of his last
trouble his crew of one boy was drowned,
and Gittins himself bumped on the bottom of the
Pacific, and came to the surface, sea boots upper-
most. He valiantly maintained that, even at 70
years, a little thing like that couldn’t hurt him ;
but his aged wife died a few months later, and
then old Gittins started to break up.
Many details of the coarse amours of a
certain notorious Australian identity, together
with information as to deeds of official jobbery
incidental to his peccadilloes, have been collated
by his disreputable acquaintances for purposes of
intimidation. The only way of relieving a high-
placed personage of the dread of exposure is to
shift him from his place. His duty to the country
is to die, but such men have no proper sense of
duty.
A simple-minded correspondent recently
asked the Australasian for a summary of the
arguments against compulsory resumption of land
and this is the reply he got
One of the main arguments advanced against coin-
pajsory resumption is that the State is led to pay an un.
duly high price for the land, which prevents closer settle-
ment thriving. Arbitrations notoriously go against the
Government, and in favor of the owner to be expropriated,
If this is avoided, and the land taken at the Government
valuation, that would be distinct confiscation,
So the Australasian’s theory seems to be this:
Closer settlement is wanted badly. The big
landlord is too unpatriotic to sell and make room
for population. To take his land by arbitration is
ruinous because he is such a swindler. To take it
at a State valuation would be confiscation because
the unpatriotic swindler is sacred. Therefore,
there is nothing to be done. The trouble is that
Australia is fully resolved to do something, and
if the Australasian manages to convince it that
the only chance to get land for the people lies in
confiscation, then it will just confiscate.

The Melbourne edition of the Stevenson-Inman
billiard match (at Alcock’s Hall) ended in a victory for
the receiver of points. Stevenson having won the pre-
vious game in Sydney, a number of people professed to
know that it was Inman’s turn this time. The men were
expected to play a deciding match, tossing for choice of
town and table. All the same, it is pretty certain that
the two Englishmen will not meet again in Australia. As
for the genuineness, or otherwise, of their “game and
game,” close watchers of the play were fully satislied that
Inman, handicapped to receive 2250 in 9000, is no gift for
the “ champion.” The last time they met in England, on
the same terms, it was Inman who won—very easily.
But inasmuch as Stevenson is a greater master of billiards
than the other man, he gets credit for being able to
“ beat him whenever he likes,” as though a start of 2250
points amounted to nothing at all.
The Westralian Test Race to pick the State’s
representative in the Warrnambool-Melbourne struggle
will eventuate on August 24, over the 116 miles between
Beverley and Perth. In addition to the honor of repre-
senting the State in the great Victorian contest, the
fastest rider will receive £2O from the Dunlop Rubber Co.
The Warrnambool-Melbourne race itself is drawing close,
and entries close with the Dunlop people, at their Mel-
bourne office, 108 Flinders-street, on August 30. The
eo. expects that at least 250 riders will start in this
classic event, which is now the recognised premier road
race of the world.

An old lacrosse man writes: A prolonged
acquaintance with the Canadian team’s lacrosse methods
has made S.A. players very thoughtful. The first result
of that thought was that they borrowed from the
Adelaide Racing Club the steel skull caps worn by jockeys
for steeplechasing ; this was only ordinary prudence, in
view of Canada's too “willing” bashing of opponents.
The second result was extreme regret for having-
shortened the ground—as earnestly demanded by Canada
after being once beaten. Any Australian, seemingly can
give any Canadian 3yds. start in 50 ; but while our'dash-
ing wing-men are taking the ball up, all Canada—dis- I
regarding them entirely—hurries down the middle for
home. Asaresult, ourattack men, with full control of the
ball, find a solid mass of four goal-keepers, or six
occasionally eight! They can’t see through the goal let
alone shoot through it. It stands to reason that a space
only 6ft. by 6ft. can be made quite impregnable if you
put enough men on the job. The position is something-
like cricket, without a leg-before rule. It is also clear
that Australia can at least draw a match, if it cares
to adopt the same tactics, and if it insists on a lari>-e
arena it may even win. This will not be sport; but it wTll
save goals. And Canada does it, and Canada is the home
of the game. The real truth is that we now play the
game as it used to be played in Canada ; but they have
meanwhile developed it on lines of simple trickery. (The
deliberate time-wasting drove the crowd nearly frantic in
Adelaide.) And the more nearly the ground is reduced to
the size of a tennis-court, the better it will be for
jugglery and goal-packing.

N.S.W. Gaming Act is evidently enticing
Christian Moses from elsewhere, for, while the roll has
swelled in Carruthers’ State, a great fading of Moses is
reported elsewhere—notably in Westralia. Last year the
W.A.T.C. registered 44 to bet in the paddock, now the
list totals only 33 ; and while 53 had authority to operate
on the flat, 28 now have the business to themselves.
Evidentß W.A. isn’t the land of milk and honey for the
layer of the odds that it once was ; either the money has
vanished or the punter is better educated to the advan-
tages of the tote.

Adelaide has been looking on at some strange
pastimes lately. A team of handball plavers made the
journey from Ballarat, and were beaten by the school-
boys of the Christian Brothers’ College. Handball is
practically the old game of fives, but to plav it success-
fully you have to be named Geoghegan or O’Rafferty or
Breheny, or words to that effect. Then came the amazing
experience of two Rugby football matches within a
week. Adelaide had not seen two within the last
ten years, but lots of unexpected talent turned
up—Neville Colley, who was lately in England
at school, and there played for Kent when Kent was
premier county ; Professor Angus, and others with Maori-
land experience, and some old Sydney players So
the Challenger men were beaten pointless, by a goal from
a try, and a dropped goal; hut next week the sailors
strengthened their team, and won the return match
Adelaide spectators, accustomed to Australian rules (in
which a free kick -is given against you if you lay a finoer
unkindly upon an opponent) voted the tackling of Rugby
malicious and devilish.

The Hog in the Car fell in recently at Wairarapa
(M.L.). First he ran down and severeh injured the wife
of a laborer. Then he talked in an abusive manner to
the husband, who had presented a bill for £2O odd for the
repair of the lady. If she hadn’t been in the road she
wouldn’t .have got hurt, and he’d see ’em all dead before
he’d part a stiver, and so forth. If they weren’t satisfied
they could go to law. The husband did, asking for £49
155., and the magistrate gave judgment for the amount
and costs. The magnate smiled, and, leaning over to the
smart young lawyer who had conducted the case against
him, intimated that he was going to appeal to the
.Supreme Court. “ You can’t! I knew that would be
your game, and purposely made the claim ss. under £5O
which is the smallest amount you can appeal over. You’re
in the mud, sir ! ” And he was. That lawyer is a public
benefactor.

The latest number of Spalding’s valuable ath-
letic library to hand is “ The Golfer’s Annual.” Although
it contains only 138 pages of reading matter, the editor
has contrived to crowd into them a record of the year’s
golf in every white man’s country, and a list of the fix-
tures for all 1907 ; also a mass of knowledge re the rules
of the game and the decisions of the Golf'Committee so
that he who bunkers may read. The number of the book
is vol. 11., No. 22.

To hand from the publishers, Messrs. Gordon
and Gotch, “ Modern Rugby Football, Maoriland
Methods.” This is the most up-to-date book on Rugby
and is from the pen of A. H. Baskerville, who is promi-
nently associated with the Maoriland Professional Team
about to leave for England. Baskerville, who was until a
few weeks ago, employed in the Maoriland Post and
Telegraph Department, is an ex-Oriental Club (Wel-
lington) player, and knows the game from A to
Z, and his book is one that no Rugby player or
enthusiast should he without. The sub-title, “Maori-
land Methods,” is suggestive. We in Australia
have seen a lot of them lately, and when the book
was opened, this was the first thing that hit the
reader in the eye Note.—The onus is on a side to
see that their opponents do not play more than 15 men
and if such side fail to do so, they must be sufferers
thereby and points scored and time played must be
counted.” This is not Baskerville’s discredit—it is a note
inserted into the rule-book by the Maoriland Referees’
Association, and throws an interesting sidelight on the
methods of the gentle Maoriland Rugbyite. However to
return to the book : To thoroughly enjoy watching a
game of Rugby, Baskerville’s book should be read before-
hand. It is better than a sherry and bitters before
dinner. To players it is a first-class magazine, and there
are quite a number of Sydney’s first-grade players who
will be twice their present value if they read, learn and
inwardly digest it. It hammers in the importance of a lot
of things they do not seem to realise as yet, such as line
kicking and starting forward rushes from the line-out
in both of which branches our men are decidedly deficient.’
Altogether, it is a handy little book that should be in the
pocket of every follower and player of Rugby.
* * « »
Somebody whose initials are quite illegible
writes to say, in defence of the Maoriland footballers,
that the cinematograph pictures are unreliable • the
rapidity with which they are taken causes them to leave
out a lot of things that happened, and to put in
things that didn’t happen. It may be so, but if it is so,
it is unfortunate that the machine left out the discredit-
able acts of the Australians, and put in so many that
reflected on the honesty of the All Blacks team.

FATHER RECOMMENDS
CUTICURA TO EVERY ONE
“ When my little boy was about four
years old (he is now about six and a
half years) a spot appeared on the side
of his face just under the ear. After
a time it broke and spread further
down. I took him to a doctor as soon
as it appeared. He was under his
orders for about three or four months
when he was much worse. Seeing in a
paper a Cuticura advertisement 1 went
and got a complete set of the Cuticura
Remedies, the Cuticura Ointment, Cuti-
cura Soap, and Cuticura Resolvent. I
took him away from the doctors and
gave him these Cuticura Remedies.
I used two large bottles of Resolvent,
five tablets of Cuticura Soap, and two
or three tins of Cuticura Ointment.
From the first bottle he began to mend
and before he had finished the two he
was wholly mended. About twelve
months after he broke out again at the
back of the neck and it spread all over
the head. I had one large and two
Bmall bottles of Cuticura Resolvent,
three tins of Cuticura, Ointment, and
four tablets of Cuticura Soap before I
got it mended. I think it took me
about three months each time. It is
now about eighteen months since he
was ill, and it has not broken out again,
bo I think he is all right now, thanks
to Cuticura. I always recommend
Cuticura wherever I can, and I will

The fate of old-pattern motor cars will shortly
be an interesting question. There are quite a number in
Australia whose disposal is a conundrum to their owners.
Motor houses fight shy of accepting them “
anything larger than a mouse-trap, and ltwillnoi be long
before some of them will sell for the price of a bicycle or
less Probably the new owners will buy trouble, but that
s their look out. Writer knows a case where an old
pattern car went begging at £6O, and the price crawled
downwards tm it stood It £3O. The ultimate buyer
turned up in a wayback cocky, who partly strayed and
was partly dragged into the place, His ignorance of
motor cars appeared to be profound, and the process of
nailing him was a long one. When the money u' as
gathered in, the staff laughed long and heartily at its
fuck in getting £25 for a stranded rattletrap. But when
Hayseed got the car home he took out the engine and
hitched it on to a chaffcutter, and putting shafts on to
the body of the vehicle be had a rubber-tyred buggy to
boot. It was a rather unusual-looking buggy, but for
hard wear it is mighty cheap at the price.

“Cross Nibs”: Here is one way in which an
oil and color merchant packs the dollars on their edges.
He manufactures a line of ready-nnxed paints, winch the
man with the brush can purchase at lower cost than else-
where. Collided with a late employee of said color pro-
vider recently, and poured a torrent of questions against
his sidehead, chiefly concerning the ti'med tints He
depressed his off-side eyelid and whispered that whiting
made a good understudy for white lead, with the addi-
tion of a little glue for adhesive purposes. Dabslappe
discovered that there was a huge profit m the substitu-
tion, also that the majority are hypnotised by a low-price
ticket. ’Twas only the other day l perceived an irascible
individual smiting a bunch of wired bristles against the
front fence of his suburban home. He moved a weary
arm what time he fervently anathematised the can of
material at his feet and the maker thereof.. Glanced at
the label in passing, and noted in conspicuous type,
“Dabslappe’s Durable Paint.” From information re-
ceived, I surmised that the glue was making its presence
felt. The weather-resisting properties of this particular
paint are exhausted in a few months, and a bath of lime-
wash would undoubtedly be just as effective fortmiber
preservation. A chalky stain will be left upon the
fingers, if rubbed upon any surface it has been applied to.
Remember, ve who contemplate the color scheme, that
whiting doth cost but one-fourth the price of whitelead,
and go ye and consider the robbery thereof.
“ Edyson ” : I met a character in Melbourne the
other day. Was taking refreshment with some friends
in a bar when the character entered. He was tall well-
built, and badly-dressed. In one hand he carried a whip,
in the other a noble potato skewered on a carving fork.
He rested his elbow on the bar counter, holding the spud
up for the inspection of the barmaid, but his head was
burned aside, and his eyes were fixed on us. His manner
was gentlemanly, dignified, quiet, and composed. I
presume you are not in immediate need of some excellent
potatoes?” He was addressing the barmaid but his
attention seemed to be on my friends.. The lookwasnot
impertinent, it was not inquisitive it invited confidence
“ No, certainly not,” snapped the barmaid. These are
exouisite potatoes. Potatoes of a similar quality from
the same land at Carrum are provided for his Excellency
the Governor-General. It was a brother to the potato I
now hold took first prize for breeding and behaviour at
the agricultural show. We have potatoes from the same
seeding two of which make a dray load. Cooked
they Ire like balls of snow. Their flavor ,s de-
lirious.” “No.no. Get out. What would I want
with potatoes?” said the barmaid. He did not n ? la "° e
at herlhut moved the spud in a graceful circle, and con-
tinued : “ These potatoes, if left to mature, assume great
dimensions. The small ones culled for domestic use have
all the virtues of the large ones concentrated. I ly ou eat
them you care for nothing else.” “ Oh, go to the devil!
said the barmaid. He continued to look at us ; his voice
was very gentle. “Flowery, full of flavor, sustaining
and patronised by vice-royalty, the superfine, clear-skin
potato. If you do not want to eat them, my d ear, wear
them on your hat. They are being used as parlor orna-
ments bv the best families.” Here my younger friend
succumbed. “Have a drink?” he sa ? d .\
specialist did not alter his manner or his attitude. Thank

hours later I was in another hotel passage, and heard a

WHY DRUGS FAIL
AND ELECTRICITY CURES I
at nlkjhgfgfij
Zs-
DRUGS cure acute diseases because the latter are of poisonous origin,
and the poison in drugs counteracts or neutralizes the poison
in the body. They fail to cure chronic diseases
or make Strength, as you who have tried them know. Chronic
ailments are caused by depletion of the nerve tissues, lack of recreation,
of fresh air and of exercise, the non-assimilation of food, and often by
excesses in eating, drinking and numerous other excesses and violations
of the laws of Nature which result in weakness of the various organs.
It goes without saying that the taking of poison into the body will not, cannot
cure these conditions, for poisons do not give nourishment.
What must be the means of cure? It certainly must be something which
replaces aud reinstates the lost or wasted vitality. It must be a natural element of
the body, not an unnatural one. No one will claim that poisons are natural elements
of the human body, for it revolts every time they are taken. An experience of
more than twenty years with drugs and Electricity has convinced us that
Electricity alone, without any other material aid, will replace and renew lost energy
and vitality. Thousands of grateful letters from cured people tell us that drugs
failed to cure, and that Electricity, as given by the new improved
dr. McLaughlin s electric belt
is the only successful means of cure. These people will tell you they have been cured by OUP Belt of Wfak-
ne s, Backache, Rheumatism, Sciatica, Stomach Troubles, and Livep and Kidney
Ailments after spending large sums of money fruitlessly in drugs and other treatments. Electricity cured them by
exercising the relaxed nerves, muscles and organs and putting back into them the element which was lost, and which
is the foundation of strength. . . . Ours are the original and standard Electric Belts pf Australasia, and our
price is as low &.S £1 in many cases.

Headache, Indigestion and
Constipation.
AN IMPORTANT DISCOVERT.
It will interest sufferers to know
that a valuable medicine, called Froo-
toids, has been discovered, which is
now completely curing each of tile
above-named complaints. Frootoids
are elegant in appearance, and plea-
sant to take, and, what is of the ut-
most Importance, are thoroughly reli-
able in affording quick relief. You
do not require to go on taking them
for a prolonged period, as is necessary
with some medicines, which even then
are mostly disappointing; you simply
take a '(Jose of Frootoids when ill aud
repeat the dose if necessary, but gene-
rally one dose is quite effective,
j Frootoids are immensely more valu-
able than an ordinary aperient, in so
far that they not only act as an ape-
rient but do remove from the blood,
tissues, and internal organs all the
waste poisonous matter that is clog-
ging them and choking the channels
that lead to and from them. The bene-
ficial effects of Frootoids are evident
at once by the disappearance of head-
ache, the head becoming clear, and a
bright cheery sense of perfect health
taking the place of sluggish, depressed
feelings, by . the liver acting properly,
and by the food being properly di-
gested.
Frootoids are the proper aperient
medicine to take when any Congestion
or Blood Poison is present, or when
Congestion of the Brain or Apoplexy
is present or threatening. They have
been tested, and have been proved to
afford quick relief in such cases when
other aperients have not done any
good at all. It is of the utmost impor-
tance that this should be borne in
mind, for in such cases to take an or-
dinary aperient is to waste time and
permit of a serious illness becoming
fatal.
Frootoids act splendidly on the liver,
and quickly cure bilious attacks that
antibilious pills make worse. Many
people have been made sick and ill
by antibilious pills that could have
been cured at once by Frootoids.
People should not allow themselves to
be duped into contracting a medicine-
taking habit by being persuaded to
take daily doses with each meal of so-
called indigestion cures that do NOT
cure. Frpotoids have been subjected
to extensive tests, and have in every
case proved successful in completely
curing the complaints named.
A constipated habit of body , will be
completely cured if the patient will on
each occasion, when suffering, take a
dose of Frootoids, instead of ah or-
dinary aperient; by so doing, the pa-
tient will require doses only at longer
intervals, and will so become quite
independent of the necessity of taking
any aperient medicine.
Frootoids are only now being placed
on the Australian market, consequently
you may at present have a difficulty
in getting them from your local che-
mist or storekeeper; but ask for them,
and if you cannot get them at once,
send stamps or postal note for price,
1/6, to W, G. Hearne, Chemist, Gee-
long, and a bottle of them will be im-
mediately forwarded to you post free.

salers can now obtain wholesale sup-
plies from W. G. Hearne, Chemist,

EIGHT YEARS SUFFERING
A PERMANENT CURE.
THE CASE OF MRS. A. WEAVER.
(BY A SYDNEY REPORTER.
No one can tell the self-denying work which
good men have done in the early days of this
country, neither can we exaggerate the nobleness
of spirit which animates present-day people in a
desire to ameliorate distress as much as lies in their
power. Therefore, the public should be informed
of some of these efforts, one of which was made by
Mrs. Alice Weaver, of No. 7 Louis Street, Redfern,
who replied to the reporter by saying :—
“About this time last year I was living in
Telopea Street, and it was just before I left there
for this place that I was fortunate in casting aside
a complaint that had worried me for no less than
eight years. What a fearful life of suffering mine
had been all that time, to be sure, and to think that
nothing in the world could benefit me made my
spirits droop lower than they will ever be again,
I hope.”
“What made you think that nothing could
benefit you ? ” queried the writer.
“I arrived at that conclusion because nothing
had done me good so far, and I believe I tried
every medicine going. At the time my second
child was born I was under a doctor, who did
everything he could for me, but stilt my health re-
mained as bad as it could be. Indeed, at that
period I was nearly dead with indigestion, al-
though I dieted myself and did all that could be
done to keep my torments in check. It was of no
avail, though, for when I ate anything I could
hardly breathe owing to a feeling which came like
a lump in my chest, from which place a sharp pain
went right through to the centre of my shoulders.
I then remained in the utmost agony until the food
was vomited up again, after which I felt so ex-
hausted that I could not think of doing a thing in
the house until I had had a good rest. It would
surprise you if you onlyknew how poor my appetite
was. You would wonder how anyone could keep
alive with it, and as for my head, oh, my sufferings
with it were awful. The most piercing pains at
onetime, and themost depressingachesat another.
Really, I think it was a marvel how I kept my
senses with the agony I endured in the head ; and
it’s strange that I did not meet with many a nasty
accident through the giddiness which used to over
take me. I was a misery to myself and everybody
around me, and to tell you the honest truth I never
thought I would live through it all. My eyes used
to feel heavy enough to drop out of their sockets,
and I was affected in the mouth by such a bitter
taste that it made me feel sick of a morning, after
putting in the usual restless nights that had done
much towards making a wreck of me. Even in the
daytime Iwasalwaysimagining something terrible
was going to happen, and these were just the very
things that Clements Tonic, which I commenced to
take, showed itself to be the master of ; for it sent
such a vigor through my frame, when I had been
taking it a couple of weeks, that I could not help
feeling joyful in the belief that at last my health
had taken a beneficial turn. I got more Clements
Tonic, and as each bottle was finished, so did my
prospects improve, for I commenced to take my
meals with a degree of heartiness which astonished
my people as much as it pleased them ; and to my
own satisfaction and delight the former discomforts
attending my meals were quickly out of existence.
Oh, dear, what a changed woman I am now to then.
My limbs do not ache from weakness like they
formerly did, and I can go about my work as
cheerfully and as actively as any housewife in the
country. I do not spend any restless nights now;
never dream during my sleep, and the pains that
used to abound have long since been driven away
from every part of my body. Well, Clements
Tonic made me the healthy woman I am, and for
the sake of other sufferers I trust you’ll publish
this interview in any way you think fit.”
STATUTORY DECLARATION.
I, Alice Weaver, of Mo. 7 Louis Street, Redfefn, in the
State of New South Wales, Commonwealth of-Australia,
do solemnly and sincerely declare that I have carefully
read the annexed document, and that it contains, and is
a true and faithful account of my illness and cure by
Clements Tonic, and also contains my full permission to
publish in any way my statements, which I give voluntary,
without receiving any payment, and I make this solemn
declaration conscientiously believing the same to be true,
and by virtue of the provisions of the Oaths Act, 1900.

The' A.l.D'.E.. — Australian Institute of
DkVrrtestic Economy—sefetrts to be making a great
success in a siriall way Of its College of House-
situated iiii i/onsdalfe-sfcteet, Melbourne,
opposite the Haw Courts. There ttas a largely
liriattended co'okery Class at the local Wotkiftg
Meii’S College when the A.l.D.E. started opera-
tions, sirid the old, slow-going ihistitutioh pro-
tested ftgaiiist the idea.of Government patronage'
for the new Domestic Economists; but whilst the'
class was losing its half-dozen members,- the little
college in Lonsdale-street was enrolling all the
students it could do with, and there are now a
number of girls waiting their turn for admission.
The business of the Institute is to advertise the
College of Housewifery with Practical Talks
at the Athenaeum Hall and other places.
Also, it is offering scholarships which entitle
the winners to 12 months of college tuition in
cookery, laundry-work, etc., and a Government
certificate at the end of the course. Scholars are
invited to compete for the “ships” in September,
and a promise of “prizes to the value of £110”
looms large on the A.l.D.E. prospectus. , The
severely businesslike “Rita,” of Melbourne
Herald, has given a lot of honorary service in
furtherance of this scheme of domestic art-culture,
likewise the demonstrations by experts are
gratuitous. It is a scheme that should specially
commend itself to newly married wives and bride-
grooms whose means are limited. An education
in housewifery may be easily and enthusiastically
acquired what time the family consists of only
two persons, and how could Angelina better ex-
press her love for Edwin than by greeting him
with the glad tidings that she has won a scholar-
ship? It costs a shilling a year to belong to the
institute.

Perhaps the most useful of the many
books perpetrated by the late Joseph Hatton was
the least literary and original of the lot. In
“In Jest and Earnest —A Book of Gossip,” one
gets an interesting collection of the old chestnut
stories and anecdotes which everybody of middle
age has heard and nobody has quite correctly re-
membered. Possibly Hatton’s recollection of the
facts and fancies he gossiped of was faulty in
many cases. Certainly his numerous instances of
J. L. Toole’s “ready wit” could have been well
spared. But the volume in other respects is worth
reading and preserving as a scrap book.
George Swinburne, the tall, thin, white-
headed Victorian Minister of Agriculture, who
gave £2000 the other day to the technical schools
of Melbourne, is the strongest and most genuinely
respected man in the Bent Government. His
Water and Hairy Acts, though badly mutilated
by the Tories, are the most progressive and states-
manlike measures Victoria has seen for many a
year. Swinburne is a man of stern and uncom-
promising decision, and a remarkably keen-witted
and resolute administrator ; and at the same time
he is the surprise and delight of all who meet him
for the first time, by reason of his courteous
manner and delightful accessibility. He is uni-
formly kind to pressmen, who vote him a man, a
brother, and a gentleman.

Motoring at this par-
ticular season of the year
is very frequently accom-
panied by bad spells of
weather that have a ten-
dency to bring coughs,
colds, and other ills in
their train. The wise
motorist, however, never
fails to carry a bottle of
“ 0.T.” in his car, and
with this famous bever-
age at hand the worst of
weather can do no harm.

WHAT IS CATARRH?
CATARRH is inflammation of the lining
membrane of the nose and adjoining
passages. If this inflammation is not ar-
rested it invades the passages which lead
from the nose to the head, ears, throat and
lungs. It injures the sight and hearing,
destroys the sense of taste and smell, ren-
ders the breath offensive, breaks down
the affected tissues, and consumes the
nasal cartilages. The discharge, passing
through the lungs and stomach, causes
dyspepsia, also consumption. Do you
want relief and cure? If so, try our
great remedy.

without his knowledge. A. lady who, a few months ago,
cured her husband with EUCRASY, he who had been a
hard drinker for years, now writes us that she has also
cured a near and dear relative, and makes a most earnest
appeal to all other women to save the drunkard.

TARIFF ITEMS.
The preliminary shots in the tariff battle
have done one good thing. They have brought
the Freetrade contingenter into the open to say
plainly what he thinks of the person he is fight-
ing for—the importer. Johnson, the alligator
sitter, asked Lyne if he knew that wholesale firms
were bleeding the retailer and the consumer by
raising prices on goods that hadn’t paid increased
duties ; and wanted to know if that sort of piracy
couldn’t be stopped. Then Hutchison requested
Lyne to tell the people that the increased prices
were exorbitant, and were not the result of the tariff,
and G. H. Reid interjected, “It has happened
every day since the foundation of the world.” It’s
good to get it on the testimony of staunch Free-
traders like Johnson and Reid that the Freetrade
importer, who is the prop and stay of Freetrade,
is a shark without a conscience, and that he has
been a shark “ since the foundation of the world.”
The new tariff sent the stodgy old Argus
clean off its head, and for a day or two it printed
almost anything. On the Sunday its Hobart
correspondent wired :
There is indignation over the increased taxation ... in
fact, all sections of the community are hit hard. Poli-
ticians are alarmed, because they foresee a further re-
duction in Tasmania’s Customs revenue.
The importer is sure that he will have to pay so
much extra duty that he will be ruined ; also he
is sure that he will pay so little duty that the
country will be ruined. The importer really ought
to make up his mind which it is going to be;
anyway, he ought to see that he only tells one
yarn at a time.
Freetrade England does a good export
trade in one line these times of its humming
prosperity—viz., blacklegs. It has become a fixed
custom nowadays with the sweater of the
European continent, when he needs the really
cheap laboring article, to turn towards the pros-
perous old Mother Land, with its booming Board
of Trade returns, and forthwith, through showers
of bricks, hurled by displaced foreign workers,
press the desperate, hungry-eyed Britishers, eager
for a job anywhere and at any price so it will
keep ghost and meat together. A couple of
months back it w r as Hamburg; more recently it
was Antwerp that absorbed, according to Reuter,
its “700 English workmen.” Given a sufficiency
of Freetrade in the United Kingdom, and the
■world will yet be offered the spectacle of inden-
tured English coolies being shipped eastward to
labor on the railways of protected Japan.
Thus an English paper :
Mr. Walter Chamberlain made a striking speech at the
shareholders’ meeting of W. and T. Avery, of which he is
chairman, at Birmingham, on 2nd July. He said they
had been forced to erect, at a cost so far of £22,000, a
factory in America, for fear their rivals should start
dumping goods here. But for the belated Cobdenism
from which the country was suffering, all this money
might have been spent in England. Other firms would
have to do as they had done. The pedants of the Cobden
Club were fiddling while Rome burned. Foreign nations
were augmenting their work because they were always
sure of two markets -their own and ours—whereas we in
England could not touch them in their markets.
Of course, no bushman dreams of drinking
his post-and-rail without milk; so the S.M.
Herald has been moved to tears over the picture
of Billjim setting out on his boundary ride with-
out the customary case of condensed milk slung to
his saddle bow, all on account of the increased
duty. But it was a grievous waste of moisture,
for there are at least half-a-dozen brands of Aus-
tralian concentrated juice on the market. Also
there is even hope for the fastidious Billjim who
can drink nothing but imported stuff; for the very
issue that contained the wail contained likewise a
remark by H. J. Preston, Australian rep. of
Nestles Limited, to the effect that his firm had
almost completed negotiations for putting
£lOO,OOO into a Queensland factory.
The campaign of Foreign-trade lies com-
menced early after the tariff appeared, and the
S. M. Herald got a flying start. Said the
Herald, amongst other things :
The people will pay more for their tea and kerosene,
so that Mr. Lyne may give a nice present to his manu-
facturing friends.
And there is no duty on tea or kerosene which
arrives in bulk, so, if people pay more for either
pn account of the tariff, some of the Herald’s
importing friends must be swindling them. The
Herald shouldn’t associate with swindlers.
The gentle importer has been at his old
tricks in Maoriland, where he has been affirming
that “boots and shoes can’t be made in this
country !” To back it up, he analysed some
cheap, locally-made footgear, and proved it to be
largely shoddy. Then the loc'al man got to work,
and analysed a lot of high-priced imported boots
and shoes, and proved that they were all shoddy
—that they were not made of leather, but of
paper and other frauds; and, moreover, that
they were shipped free on board the cargo
steamer at3s. per pair. The cheaplocal boot at least
consisted of some kind of leather, while the higher-
priced one was of splendid material. Butin the
imported lines, from the highest to the lowest,
shoddy stuck out like the bowsprit of a pirate.
Now the importers are sorry they spoke, and
there is talk about heavier duties and a Commerce
Act, to ensure that the person who asks for
leather boots shall not be taken down with brown
paper.
“ Father-o’-Five ” : I am in the country,
rabbiting. My wife writes to say that the new
tariff will make her household bills fully two
shillings a week bigger. Do I, a mere hard-
grafter, growl and grumble, and swear that Aus-
tralia is being ruined by Protection, because it hits
my small pocket a bit for a while ? No —I just
grin and bear it, and catch extra rabbits, because
I know that the burden will be lightened by-
and-bye by the blessings that will follow our
encouragement of our own industries. The bulk
of the complaining will be done by the importers
and their satellites and those whose thinking
faculties are atrophied. The exporters won’t
complain—and it’s the exporters who are going to
make Australia.
As the Worker puts it: —
A boilermaker suicided in Sydney last week. For
some time past he had been out of work, and had become
despondent. Meanwhile, the Oarruthers Government
continues to pay workers’ passages from England.
Yes; and, meantime, while a boilermaker suicides
because the work he should be doing in Sydney is
done in foreign countries, the Workek’s party
continues to “sink the fiscal issue.”
It seems now that the tariff is ‘ ‘ ill-timed ; ”
it is absurd, according to various importers whose
views have been raked into print, to put up the
tariff while the country is prosperous and there
are no unemployed. It is hard to please some
people. If the tariff were put up during a de-
pression they would want to know why that par-
ticular time was seized on, instead of waiting till
the people were prosperous and could afford to
pay the duties. Also, they would in that case
point out that new industries required capital,
and they would want to know what sort of a fool
Government it was that tried to force industries
just when the necessary capital wasn’t available.
When the men it interviewed wouldn’t
lie up to specifications concerning the tariff, the
Argus supplied all the desired lying in the head-
ings. For instance (Argus 12/8/’O7): —
PUTTING UP PRICES.
WOMEN’S CLOTHING AFFECTED.
Mr. Crossley, of Foy and Gibson, said the tariff would
not affect that firm’s business at a 11.... In some articles
of women’s clothing there would, for a time at any rate, be
an increase in prices. One result of the tariff would be
that the firm would extend its already large fac-
tories. The firm was putting lines of tweeds before its
customers that seemed to suit them better than any-
thing that could be imported at the price.... Under the
new duties more making up would be done locally, and
there would be an increase of work in the factories.... A
manufacturer of Rheims said he would be prepared to
consider the establishment of a factory for cashmeres,
provided the Commonwealth gave Protection up to one-
third.
That must have been a bitter pill to swallow; but
the Argus put on the brazen head-lines, and
risked it.
A meeting of Sydney piano importers last
week unanimously resolved
The tariff is not Protection, but Prohibition, and the
musical education of the whole of Australia must suffer
if the people are forced to buy an inferior class of
instrument.
What strikes one at first blush about this resolu-
tion is the cheek of the people who thus off-
handedly assume that an Australian-made piano
must necessarily be “an inferior class of instru-
ment.” But a glance at the names of the people
who are so broken up about the injury that is
going to happen to Australia explains a lot. Here
are some of them: Berlin Piano Co., J. Hers,
Weidemann and Co., Hoffnung and Co., Aengen-
heyster and Co., and Feldheim, Gotthelf and Co.
And these people, it seems, are true Australians,
thinking nothing about their foreign pockets, and
only harassed by alarms lest the musical education
of this country may go to the dingoes.
Victorian Premier Bent’s trip abroad gave
him a chance to compare Freetrade Britain’s
wages rates with those of Australia :
He found everywhere that the wages did not compare
with those in Australia, or, at any rate, in Victoria ; and,
besides, the men worked 10 hours a day against eight
hours worked by Australians. At one iarge ironworks
at Rochester, where 2500 men were employed, he learned
that the wages paid were 25 per cent, less for 10 hours’
labor than Australian manufacturers paid for eight
hours. On the railways of England the rates were 20 per
cent, less than the rates in vogue in Victoria. Generally,
the wages of the working class in England were poor,
and he considered that, industrially, Victoria was a long
way ahead of the Mother land.
Thomas Bent, Victoria’s uproarious Pre-
mier, is no angel, but at least there is no stinking
fish in his basket. He had not reached his own
State before he roared in the ear of everybody
who would listen, “Australia is the best country
in the world.” And when he got to Wodonga he
woke that township with ‘‘This Sydney express
is the best-appointed train in the world.”
Goldsbrough, Mort and Co. report re wool: —
There has been an active inquiry during- the past week.
Transactions, however, have been confined to local fell-
mongered descriptions, some fairly large lots of which we
have disposed of at satisfactory prices. The quantity
available for the sales next week will be small owing to
many of the clips at present in store being incomplete.
Reports from manufacturing centres show that trade is
flourishing in spite of an exceptionally wet summer in
England. Tnis is the time of year when those interested
in the wool trade look for some of the larger topmakers
“bearing’’the market; under present conditions it will
require an exceptionally strong “bearing” movement to
influence prices to any great extent. Generally speaking,
market prospects are distinctly encouraging for the new
clip.*

IT is astonishing 1 how human the GraMophone of to-day has become, when compared with the talking machine of the past. One
can instantly recognise the voice of the greatest artist through the medium of a GraMophone Record. Music lovers have long
ceased to wonder at the accurate reproduction of the art of the singer when listening to the GraMophone. Every note, every point
of phrasing the singer's art, in fact the individuality of their rendering, that is what rouses admiration and enthusiasm among the listeners
of a record made by Patti, Melba, or Caruso. The greatest singers have chosen the GraMophone as the medium to enable thousands
to whom it may not be possible to hear them sing in person, to enjoy their glorions vocal gifts. The voice that emanates from the
trumpet before us is the true human effort. It is undistinguishable from the living voice of the singer. It is the LIVING VOICE.
Owing to the VAST IMPROVEMENTS MADE IN THIS INSTRUMENT and NEW METHODS OF
the voice and the record of it are one and the same thing. BUT BE SURE YOU HEAR A GRAMOPHONE^

, 'T'HIS wonderful new Forage Plant was introduced into North America two years ago
from Africa. The first year, according to official returns, 74,668 farmers planted
Penicillaria, and their experience was so entirely satisfactory that last year 225,000 farmers
adopted it, and this year over a million have undertaken its cultivation in preference to
I all other kinds of fodder plants. The Ameri<an agricultural newspapers are full of letters
from farmers in all parts of the States, from the cold prairies of Manitoba to the torrid
plains of Texas and Florida, from the Atlantic seaboard to the Pacific coast, all describing
the amazing success of Penicillaria; not a single failure has been reported. The
supply of Penicillaria Seed we have been able to obtain this season is only sufficient for
experimental and seeding purposes, but we hare arranged for a large stock of seed for
next season's requirements. We can. therefore, now only offer sample packets of the
seed to enable farmers to plant test plots, which will satisfy them as to the highly valuable
?ualities of this remarkable plant, and encourage them to cultivate it extensively in the
uttire. Sample Packets of Penicillaria Seed 2s. 6d. posted. Not more than two packets
Will be sold to any person, aa it is our object to have as many farmers as possible give this
plant a trial. Send for Descriptive Circular giving full particulars and directions for
cultivation ;we will post it free. Obtainable only from

In his office in Melbourne, surrounded by Charts and Dials of strange design, Prof. Henri De Astro studies daily- over the
lives of men and women who have written him for advice on affairs of Business, hove, Speculation, Travel, Marriage, Health,
aad the important events of Life. The following letters give an idea of .. .
MR. DE ASTRO’S ABILITY.
You sent me a life Horoscope last
fall which was very correct, and I
can recommend you as a true reader
of one’s life according-to the stars.
The thing's you mention have come
true exactly as foretold ; the long-
journey, the supposed friend who
would cause me trouble, and the loss
by theft. You recommended me to
deal in ladies’ dress goods. I am
doing so,, and have been very fortu-
nate. You also pictured my health
correctly.
CORA G. HAMPTON.
MY ADVICE BROUGHT
MONEY.
Brisbane.
I am proud to tell you that 1 have profited
greatly by following the advice contained in my
Horoscope. I had about given up taking a
journey, but when you advised it so strongly, I
reconsidered and took the journey, passed my ex-
aminations, and am now in a position to earn from
£2O to £25 per month. I would not take £lO for
the ad vice you gave me.
I believe every young person starting in life
should V))' all means secure a Horoscope from you.
Nothing I ever received has given me such power
to control conditions and circumstances as your
Horoscope.
Wishing you every success,
I am, yours trulv,
B. H. RANDALL.
Your entire statement of past and present is abso-
lutely true, lucky days, journeys, that treacherous
friend all correctly named. It is wonderful how you
can describe everything and answer my questions
without the slightest error. I am well pleased with
reading, and am only sorry I did not have it years
ago, for I know I would have been spared much
trouble.
MARY A. HOUGARD.
EVERYTHING PERFECTLY
TRUE.
Goulburn.
I can truthfully say I feel happier since I
have received my Horoscope, and think every-
one should have one. Everything you told me
is perfectly true. You have read me to the
letter. Should I need advice in the future, I
shall surely write you.
LILY CONBEE.
MY PREDICTIONS CAME
TO PASS.
Tranche.
I am very much pleased with my Horoscope.
Many of the things told ine have already come to
pass. The disappointment you predicted for
January was true, and in March I was successful
in winning a match. What vou told me regard-
ing my friends was true.—E. ANDREWS.
The accuracy of recent predictions made by this eminent Astrologer has caused
many of his friends to believe that he possesses a supernatural power, but
he modestly asserts that his predictions are due alone to a scientific under-
standing of natural laws. The many thankful letters Prof. De Astro has received
from people wiho have benefited by his advice furnish ample proof that he is sincere
in his work and has a kindly feeling towards humanity.
Readers of “ The Bulletin ” can obtain a Reading by addressing a
letter to PROF. DE ASTRO, 366 BOURKE STREET, MELBOURNE*

CHRONIC BRONCHITIS.
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE THE MOST EFFECTIVE REMEDY.
Mr. Hearne. Dear Sir, —I have used a number of bottles of your medicine for bronchitis, which was a chronic
complaint of mine, and I must say that of all the medicines I have taken (including those from Drs.) none have
proved so effectual as your Bronchitis Cure. I have recommended it to many others. Yours faithfully,
THOS. OLIVER, Proprietor of “ The Lilydale Express,” Lilydale, Victoria.

of influenza. While I acknowledge that all good comes from only one source, ordinary gratitude bids me to
offer my earnest thanks to you, through whom this particular blessing has come.—l remain, dear sir, yours

results, and now recommend it to my friends. Wishing you every success—l am, yours truly,
J. ERSKINE, Kilbirnie, New Zealand.
BRONCHITIS AND PLEURISY.
A SEVERE CASE CURED BY TWO BOTTLES OF HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE.
AFTER OTHER TREATMENT HAD FAILED
Mr. Hearne, Chemist, Geelong.
Dear Sir, —Some months ago in Sydney, I suffered from a severe attack of influenza, and was confined to my
room for about a week, at the end of which time, feeling somewhat better, I got up and tried to transact my busi-
ness as usual. But I got up too soon, for the very next day I had a relapse, and suffered tortures from what the
doctor told me was pleurisy and bronchitis. The pain from the former in my chest and shoulders was frightful, and
for four long weeks I was confined to my bed under the care of a well-known Sydney doctor, and all the time his
medicine gave me but temporary relief. The landlady of the hotel (the Cleveland), where I resided, told me of a
medicine—Uearne’s Bronchitis. Cure—from Victoria, which had cured her of a bad attack of bronchitis and pains in
the chest, and begged of me to try it. I did so, and, in thanks and gratitude to you, tell you that, after the second
bottle, my cough had ceased ; but what is more astonishing, the pains from pleurisy entirely left me, and in about
a week I Was able to attend to my duties as usual.—Yours faithfully,
J. BRAHAM, Melbourne Punch Office, Melbourne.
BRONCHITIS.
CHILD’S LIFE SAVED BY HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE.
AFTER THE CASE HAD BEEN “GIVEN UP.”
Mr. Hearne. Dear Sir, —We have to thank your bronchitis cure that we have one little boy spared to us, as we
nearly lost him. After doctors had given him up, we saw the advertisement for your Bronchitis Cure, and gave it a
trial, with the result above mentioned.—Yours faithfully,
(Mrs.) E. GRANT, Chiltern, Victoria.
QUEENSLAND TESTIMONY.
FROM BRISBANE WHOLESALE CHEMISTS.
We Often hear your Bronchitis Cure spoken well of. A gentleman told us to-day that he had given it to a child
of his with most remarkable results, the child being quite cured in three doses. We are, faithfully yours,
THOMASON, OHATER and CO., 69 Queen Street, Brisbane.
BRONCHITIS.
A VERY OBSTINATE CASE.
CURED THROUGH PERSEVERING IN THE TREATMENT BY HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir,—Having been a sufferer from bronchitis for a number of years and not being able
to get relief from doctors I started taking your Bronchitis Cure about two years ago, and have been taking it on and
off ever since. lam happy to tell you that I now feel thoroughly cured, and I can bear testimony to its worth.—l
am yours truly,
W. J. CLARKE, Redbank, via Avoca, Victoria.
A CHILD SEVEN MONTHS OLD—A SUFFERER FROM BIRTH.
CURED BY A BOTTLE OF HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir, —Kindly forward me a small bottle of your Bronchitis Cure as soon as possible, as
I cannot speak above a whisper, owing to a cold. I had a bottle from you before for my little girl when she was
seven months old. She had been suffering from bronchitis from her birth, and now she is three years old, and has
not had a return of it since. It is a splendid medicine for bronchitis or colds of any sort.—l remain, yours truly,
Mrs. H. RAM AGE, Violet Town, Victoria.
A SEVEN YEARS’ CASE.
EXPECTORATING BLOOD AND MATTER.—COMPLETELY CURED.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir, —Your medicine has cured me of bronchitis and asthma from which I had
ere “ tor , upwards of seven years, during which period I was scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the
difficulty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in succession i had to sit up. I write to you this acknow-
ledgment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent coug*h, expectorating - blood and matter, and apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of the
medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily improved as I continued the treatment, until I became as I am now,
quite well. —Yours sincerely,
. H. WALKER, Balmain, Sydney.
ASTHMA.
TWO OBSTINATE OASES CURED BY HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS AND ASTHMA CURE.
AFTER OTHER TREATMENT HAD FAILED.
, M r ‘ M - Hearne. Dear Sir, —It is with much thankfulness I write to let you know that I have taken three
bottles of your Bronchitis and Asthma Cure. I had previously suffered terribly from asthma for about three years,
and had tried everything, and had advice, but without avail. I had been for a fortnight at a time without moving
day or night out of my chair. If I went to bed I was not able to lie down. We came to New Zealand about three
years ago from Tasmania. One of my uncles there suffered with asthma for a number of years till he took your cure
about five years ago, and has never had the asthma since. I knew this, but it had passed out of my mind until read-
mg your advertisement in some Tasmanian papers brought it to my memory. I told my husband, and he got your
cure for me, which I have taken with completely satisfactory result.—Yours respectfully,
W. McCOMBE, Mosgiel, New Zealand.

SUPPLY TO LONDON.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir, —I am in receipt of your favor of the 27th inst., in which you acknowledge my
order for Bronchitis Cure to be sent to my parents in London. I am sure their annual bronchial attacks will be
greatly relieved if not cured or prevented, bj r your valuable preparation. My own experience, and that in connec-
tion with my two-year-old son, has been pre-eminently satisfactory, and I shall continue to highly recommend it for
both old and young, and I offer you the use of this letter should you deem it worth using.—Yours truly,
HERBERT E. WHITE,
“ Holmsdale,” Bowral Street, Kensington, Sydney, N.S.W.
ACUTE BRONCHITIS.
LIFE SAVED BY HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir,—l have much pleasure in stating that I have derived great benefit from taking
Hearne s Bronchitis Cure. Can confidently say it has saved my life. I was a martyr to Acute Bronchitis before
taking* it. I trust this letter will induce others to try it.—Yours truly,
E. F, BROTHERTON, 223 Chapel Street, Prahran, Victoria.
BEWARE OF IMITATIONS! The great success of HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE has induced a number of
unprincipled persons to make imitations, each calling his medicine “ Bronchitis Cure,” with the object of deceiving the simple-
minded, and so getting a sale for an imitation which has none of the beneficial effects that HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE
has. Consequently it has become necessary to draw r your attention to this fact, and to request you in your own interests to be
particular to ask for HEARNE’S and see that you get it.
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE—Small Size, 2s. 6d.; Large Size, 4s. 6d. Sold by Chemists and Medicine Vendors, and by the
Proprietor, W. G. HEARNE, Chemist, Geelong, Victoria. Eorwarded to any Address when not obtainable locally.
NOTICE,.— Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure No. 1A does NOT contain any poison within the meaning of the Act. It is equally
beneficial for the youngest child and the most aged person.

digestion by Infants and Invalids.

Biographical item from the West :
During the Fremantle (W.A.) lumpers’ strike six years
ago the local Wesleyan parson, G. E. Wheatley, played a
prominent part as mediator, but his efforts in that direc*
tion were viewed with sour suspicion by the men them-
selves. A little later on he resigned from the ministry,
and started in the land-booming and auctioneering line.
He got tangled up in several heavy ventures, and was
rather severely handled by the Official Receiver, who
suggested that it was not the usual thing for an agent to
receive commission from both sides, particularly when
the estate was in bankruptcy and under the jurisdiction
of the court. Wheatley then took over a big pile of shops
—mostly empty—in the leading Perth thoroughfare, and
transformed them into a big temperance pubbery under
the title of King Edw’ard’s Hostel. He invited the
Ministry and a crowd of public men to hold
forth at the opening on the beauties of total abstin-
ence. Within 12 months afterwards the gentle Wheatley
obtained a full hotel license for his regal coffee house,
and he promptly traded the concern off at a big profit to
an opulent city councillor. Before passing the contents
of the cellar over to the purchaser, Wheatley is said to have
discovered that the bulk whisky was too strong, and to
have pumped considerable quantities of water into the
casks—anyhow the water was there. An excise
officer happened to pay an unexpected visit and made
trouble, and an unsympathetic Bench fined Wheatley a
fiver with many costs for reducing whisky below statutory
strength. Also it remarked that the incoming landlord
had better overhaul the liquor carefully. Many things
are liable to happen to a n'.&cffeeaaUiinltheuubildiy.AMit.t.

By the Oldest Inhabitant .
The Tebbutts, of which Astronomer John represents the
third generation since the family began to leave afoot-
f ... . , , ■ winHonr CN S W 1 for
mark hereabouts, have resided in Windsor (Jn.o. YV.j tor
over a century. The grandfather, John Tibbutts (so
spelled), emigrated from England in 1301, with his wife,
two sons, and one daughter. Soon after arrival the
family settled in Windsor district, and engaged in bucolic
pursuits. John Tebbutt was one of the signers of an
address to Lieutenant-Colonel Paterson, asking him to
hurry up and restore tranquility to the colony. The
address, dated 18th April, ISOB, contains this para-
graph :
“ The whole Government appears to be put into the
hands of John McArthur, Esq., who seems a very im-
proper person, he having been a turbulent and trouble-
some character, constantly quarrelling with his Majesty’s
Governors, and other principal officers, from Governor
Phillip to Governor Bligh, and we believe him to be the
principal agitator and promoter of the present alarming
and calamitous state of the coiony.”
The signers were mostly Hawkesbury settlers and sup-
porters of Governor Bligh. The brothers Thomas and
John Tebbutt, failing to make agriculture pay, started
as storekeepers, or, as they were described in those days,
“dealers,” in George-street, Windsor. The business was
wound up in the early ’forties. John, the astronomer,
was born in Windsor, May 24, 1834. His father, after he
gave up “dealing,” a word strangely suggestive of rabbits
and bottles nowadays, w'ent back on the land at the place
known as “The Peninsula,” where John now’ has his
Observatory.

REMARKABLE
INVENTION
FOR THE
CULTURE
OF HAIR
CHE EVANS VACUUM CAP is a practical invention constructed on scientific and
hygienic principles, by the simple means of which a free and normal circulation
is restored throughout the scalp. - The minute blood vessels are gently stimulated
to activity, thus allowing the food supply, which can only be derived from the blood,
to be carried to the hair roots, the effects of which are quickly seen in a healthy, vigorous
growth of hair. There is no rubbing, and as no drugs or chemicals of whatsoever kind
are employed, there is nothing to cause irritation. It is only necessary to wear the Cap
three or four minutes daily.
60 DAYS’ FREE TRIAL!
The Company's Guarantee.
An EVANS VACUUM CAP will be sent you for sixty days’ free
trial. If you do not see a gradual development of a new growth of hair,
and are not convinced that the Cap will completely restore your hair, you
are at liberty to return the Cap with no expense whatever to yourself. It
is requested, as an evidence of good faith, that the price of the Cap be
deposited with the Chancery Lane Safe Deposit Company of London, the
largest financial and business institution of the kind in the world, who will
issue a receipt guaranteeing that the money will be returned in full, on
demand, without questions or comment, at any time during the trial period.
The eminent Dr. I. N. LOVE, in his address to the Medical Board on the subject of Alopsecia (loss of
hair) stated that if a means could be devised to bring nutrition to the hair follicles (hair roots), without
resorting to any irritating process, the problem of hair growth would be solved. Later on, when
the EVANS VACUUM CAP was submitted to him for inspestion, ha remarked that the Cap would
fulfil and confirm in practice the observations he had previously made before the Medical Board.
Dr. W. MOORE, referring to the invention, says that the principle upon which the Evans Vacuum
Cap is founded is absolutely correct and indisputable.

The Drunkenness of Michael
Strood.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MIKE STROOD was branding his
heifers, and there was an odor of scorched
hide and sounds of profanity in the air.
MikeStrood had been drinking, and was all over
the shop, mad even for him. He had been
drinking for a week, and he got worse every day,
and would be due for an attack of jim-jams in a
very short time if he went on. And the men
reckoned the sooner he had his jim-jams the
better, for he made the pace too uneasy for them,
with his hustling and shouting and swearing
—swearing at the hands, swearing at the
cows, swearing at the fences, and cursing pro-
fusely at himself. And he made Peter swear,
too, when he snatched the brand out of his
hands with “Not that
way you —— fool ! ” and in the bustle
of it scraped the corner of its hot end against
Peter’s forearm. For an instant it looked as if
Mike Strood and his cattle and his farm and
everything that was his were going to be laid
waste, there was such brimstone in Peter’s face.
But Peter controlled himself presently, and was
ordered about and shouted at like the rest.
That was one of the curious things about Peter
—why he did control himself and stand things,
ass as he was in many ways—and for the matter
of that why he fooled on at Mike Strood’s when
he could have bettered himself at half-a-dozen
different places round if he’d wanted to. People
said it was because Peter was an old flame of
Bessie Strood’s that he worked on at her hus-
band’s place. They said it openly, anywhere
except to Peter's face, or in front of Mike
Strood.
Some, men chiefly, said it “ served Strood
right,” whatever that meant. The women, of
course, went the other way, fixing bad names on
Bess, and saying it was no wonder her “ pore hus-
band ” took to drink with a wife like that.
Meanwhile, Mike Strood pranced about with
his branding iron. He was just about fit for the
asylum, and in his performances he kicked over
the old kerosene tin full of red-hot coals. Some
of the contents rolled through the fence and set
fire to the grass on the other side, and there was
about six feet of flame in an instant, and all
hands had to turn to and save the homestead. Then
for about an hour Mike Strood was half sober till
things righted again. Everybody was in a
smother of smoke and smut and sweat, so Strood
sent the lad Tom with a can for beer to the
shanty, about half a mile up the road, while he
got the fire going for his irons again.
Bessie came out when the grass caught fire, and
helped with the rest to put it out, and she might
now have gone inside about her business if she
had liked to. But she didn’t like. Instead, she
hung round talking to Peter and the men, as she
was too fond of doing. She was there when Tom
came back with the beer, and Strood and the rest
drank it in turns out of the same pannikin. She
stood with her bare plump arms akimbo, and
allowing a good deal of herself round the neck
(she was never particular to a button or a hook
or two), talking to Peter and ehyaeking her
husband about setting the place on fire.
Strood got wild, and dug the pannikin into the
beer. He gave it to Peter, who was already
drunk, and told Bessie to go off into the house.
She told him to go and hang himself, and said that
he had had enough drink for one day, without send-
ing for more and “making others as bad as him-
self!”
This he took to brazenly mean that he was
spoiling Peter, a better man, inferentially, and
that made him wilder than before. And by this
time everybody was drunk except Bess, who was
only foolish.
They were all going on like a lot of maniacs,
and no wonder there was a row. Peter stood
grinning in a beery way all the time, and saying
idiotic things to Bess. Presently Strood took
another gulp of beer, and, catching up his brand
out of the coals, he sang out, “ Here ! Run her in
quick and lively ” (he looked at Peter and pointed
at Bess). “ Damn it, we’ll brand her with the
rest of the cows ! ”
Bess curled her lip at him, but the men thought
the jest worth a grin each. Strood winked at
Peter, and that bulky fool took it to mean that
there was a joke on foot.
So Peter, being even drunker than he looked,
seized Bess by the arms from behind and began
marching her up to the rails, and winked foolishly
at the boys to enter into the spirit of the fun.
Bess screamed wildly, but big Peter whispered in
her ear that he' d look after her and not let the
drunken fool hurt her. Yet the drunken fool
was soberer than Peter was, and Bess saw some-
thing dreadful in his eyes, and screamed all the
louder as they hauled her towards the rails in
what they thought was mere horse-play.
She knew it wasn’t play, and she well nigh
went mad. “ He’ll murder me ! He’ll murder
me ! ” she cried. “ Pete, you fool, let me go ! ”
But there is such little difference between the cries
that are uttered in mere play and those of real
tragedy that they didn’t understand, especially
as they were drunk. Peter was too intent on
managing her to watch the aspect of mad Mike
Strood. They were all pretending that they
were pretending to hold her, while there was no
pretence at all about it. Her clothes were being
torn off her back in the struggle, and Peter’s face
was bleeding from a murderous scratch she had
scrawled all down it. And yet the silly beery
lover never saw through things, and still went
on keeping his end uppermost in what he thought
was a clumsy joke, while Strood shouted, “ We’ll
put an S on her! We’ll put an S on ! She
might get lost, and they wouldn't know who
owned her.”
So he pulled her dress down over her arm,
exposing the white skin of her bare shoulder, and
with glaring eyes and set teeth he planted on it
the smoking iron which sizzled on to her plump
flesh amid a little cloud of smoke.
“ Now you’ll bear a mark on you to tell who
you belong to, my lady,” he cackled.
For a second or two the men stood with their
mouths open, still holding her and still looking
at Strood.
Bess, with a last wild yell that still echoed
round, had fainted from terror, and even the
horrible injury had not recalled her to her senses.
She lay now a dead weight in Peter’s arms.
Peter let her go with both hands when he
realised the situation, and both his fists seemed
to crash into Strood’s face the moment after.
Mike Strood went down to earth like a log.
“ You murderous villain,
you ! ” and he stood over him with clenched fists,
a leg on each side, looking down on him and wait,
ing for him to move.
He did move, which was foolish of him, and
then and there Peter killed Mike Strood.
The hot iron, which nobody had thought about,
had fallen harmlessly out of the way.
Then the men laid Bess down on the ground,
and ran for some water.

The Three Quests.
[FOR THE BULLEITN. ]
FOR a thousand miles as the black crow flies,
and a full three-score beside.
If you go nor’-west by the Wallaby Track
and over the Great Divide,
You will come to a high and a lonely hill, with
never a shrub or tree ;
Though hardly a man of all our men has ever been
there to see.
But only the aboriginal men of the tribe of the
Native Bear
Have scaled the rocks to precipitous heights to
hold corroborees there ;
To leap and to twist like painted snakes in the
light of the languid moon,
To the mystic rites of the tribal dance and the
chant of their ancient rune.
And he that has charge of the Talking Stick that
is carven with signs of dread,
Isold Apura; by right of skill he walks at his
people’s head.
The words that he speaks are few and terse, and
the deeds that he does are grim,
And woe to the breaker of tribal law that falls to
the clutch of him.
There were three adventurous pioneers who
turned to the ways out back,
From out of the town and over the down to the
desolate Wallaby Track;
By bed of river and crest of hill and homesteads
rare they hied
Till they passed the belt of the Saltbush runs and
the ridge of the Great Divide.
Now one had a quest most dear to his breast, and
he followed it fast and far ;
He urged it south by the harbor mouth and north
by the northern star ;
It led him into the tropical zones, and into
Antarctic cold,
And he said, “ No rest till I find my quest, the
mountain of solid gold.”
And one had a quest most dear to his breast; he
followed it far and wide ;
By Tiber and Seine he sought in vain; by marvel-
lous Ganges’ side;
By Papuan hills and Asian rills, in the fountain
of Tears and Truth,
Saying, “ Never I rest till I find my quest, the
Spring of Eternal Youth.”
And one had a quest most dear to his breast; he
followed it everywhere,
By the Bodhisat, and the land of Joss, and the
place of the Moslem’s prayer;
By Christian spire ; he did not tire, but ever he
sought a sign,
Saying, “Never I rest till I find my quest, a
proof of the Myth Divine.”
They came to the place of the lonely hill at the
noon of a dreary day,
Anri they spoke the tribe of the Native Bear;
eaters of men were they !
And the three knew the place was an evil place;
they woke to a dreadful fear,
For they saw in the ebony faces there the old
man-hungering leer.
Now, sudden and swift each man was seized and
haled to a lonely height—
The tribe of the Bear had arms of steel and his
withes are fast and tight;
To three high stakes on a ledge of rock they were
bound and left alone.
For that is the rite of the white man’s meat, and
sweetens the blood and bone.
With faces turned to the lonely peak, they hung
in a ghastly row,
And they saw the sun sink into the West, and it
sank in a lurid glow ;
Throughout the day they had gasped and groaned
and writhed in his burning beams,
Till their eyes grew blurred, and their senses dim,
and they woke the stars with their screams.
The chill of the night went through their bones as
a languid moon arose;
The dews but moistened their burning lips and
lengthened their dreary throes ;
Till the long night passed, and the East grew
grey, and the wings of the morning stirred,
When a miracle came to their dying eyes, for a
wonderful thing occurred.
The clouds drew back, like a misty veil, and away
from the mountain rolled ;
The first rays struck on the lofty peak, and
turned it to living gold ;
And one cried out, “Behold my quest —the moun-
tain of gold at last! ”
His tortured face transfigured with joy, he sank
in his bonds and passed.
The beams came down to a waterfall and lit it
with rainbow hues,
Till it leapt like a myriad living things in a
shower of fairy dews.
And one cried out, “’Tis the Spring of Youth—
the Hope of the World is found ! ”
And his ghost went out exultingly, leaving his
carcase bound.
Then the sun looked over the mountain rim
and into the third man’s eyes—
Eyes that were blurred with the mists of death—
and he said, “It is Paradise !
The gates of Glory are opened wide; a sign ! a
sign ! ” he cried.
And with that splendor upon his face he drooped
his head and died.
For a thousand miles as the black crow flies, and
a full three-score beside,
I went nor’-west by the Wallaby Track, and
over the Great Divide.
And came to a high and lonely bill with never a
shrub or tree.
Where three grim posts on a ledge of rock bore
witness of this to me!

BILIOUSNESS.
A Great Sufferer Permanently Cured.
The following letter just to hand from a New Zealand resident further
supports the claims made for Bile Beans —that they cure promptly, positively,
and permanently. Some four years ago this gentleman forwarded us a
testimonial embodying his gratitude for the great good he had derived from
Bile Beans, and he sends the letter below to inform us that he still enjoys
good health, and has had no return of his old complaints. Such testimony
is of the utmost value to the general public,
because the need of a remedy devoid of harm-
ful drugs, gentle in action, certain in effect,
and which has stood the test of time, is as
great to-day as it ever was. Such a medicine
is Bile Beans, the world’s greatest specific for
all liver ailments.
Mr. H. Symon, of Twede Street, Oamaru, N.Z., says :
—“Close on four years ago, it was my pleasure to
testify to Bile Beans as a cure for Biliousness and
Indigestion. Up to that time I was a great sufferer
from these distressing complaints ; so much so, that I
was bent and aged beyond my years, and it was only
with difficulty and pain that I could perform my work.
I underwent a course of Bile Beans, and they made me
a. different man. I was able to walk upright and per-
form my work with ease and comfort. As it is four
years since I testified to the cure Bile Beans performed
bn me, I think it only right, after so many years, to in-
form you that I am still enjoying good health. < and
have had no return of my old complaints. On no consideration would I be without Bile
Beans in the house. As a family medicine they are a splendid corrective, and are easy and
pleasant to take.”

The Hat.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Twelve millions of the people of Britain are paupers.—
Campbell-Bannerman'.
The income of the English landlords amounts to
£150,000,000 per annum. — Statistics.
Take off the lid of England—let us gaze in the
seething vat;
And what is England’s secret —the secret of
England’s fat ?
Behold the stewing paupers—behold them in their
plight;
And these are the pride of Britain —of the proud
old race and white !
These are the living secret, these anguished things
that crawl
Through the rain-swept streets of London by the
Fat One’s palace wall.
These have produced her stoutness —aye, these
have produced her fat —
These have supplied their Master with his wealth
and his Shining Hat!
Turn back to the South Sea atoll, where the tiny
polypes toil;
These are the English people—these insect things
that moil,
These are their polype-symbols —like their medul-
lary pulp
Are the blood and the grief and labor that the
English landlords gulp !
So low that one may not tell them .from proto-
plasmic forms—
Aipt building their insect-Empire beneath the
y pacific’s storms;
So "'Britain’s paupers labor —poor Sandy, and
Hodge, and Pat—
For the sake of England’s fatness and the shine
on Balfour’s Hat!
The polypes toil and perish—they spend their
strength and die;
And the worn-out paupers sicken in the noisome
English sty.
Like zoophytes true they labor, these pale
cephalopods
Who bow their knees in worship to Britain’s
crazy gods!
As the builders of the atoll feed the cruising bird
of prey,
So the paupers bred in England feed the land-
lord race for aye—
Yea, they bow to the landlord fetich, and it
towereth like Ararat;
So hooray for England’s fatness, and the shine on
Cohen’s Hat !
There’s another Thames of sorrow —it flows to
that Sluggish Sea
That is fed from the eyes of paupers, grown old in
their misery.
There’s a Bridge that spans that River —the
River of Paupers’ Tears—
And an army marches o’er it with its face to the
hopeless years.
Lo ! a chariot thunders after, and Mammon sits
on high,
While the paupers groan hosannas as the Empire-
sham rolls by.
Aye, they cheer for the good King Cohen —they
huzza for the plutocrat
Who feasts on England’s fatness, and struts in a
Blatant Hat !
Ye prate of England’s glory, but what of Eng-
land’s shame,
Since ye bow to a tawdry greatness that is great-
ness but in name?
For what is her vaunted freedom but freedom to
oppress—
To wring the landlord’s tribute through blood and
bitterness 1
Far better that Saxon England, ere the million-
aires and sots
Had risen from slums like London’s, where the
heart of a people rots !
Far better the feudal baron who midst his vassals
sat,
Than the pauper-fattened landlord, who props up
a Garish Hat.
Art proud of the Newer Conquest —of Cohen s
diadem ?
Go ask of the English paupers—win England
back for them !
The “precedents may broaden,” but heavier grow
the gyves
That fetter England’s millions and crush their
stunted lives !
Dost wait for a bloodier Senlac—when the hungry
hosts shall rise,
With the grief and the pain of ages in their
anguished, sunken eves ?
Beware of the Day of Spurning, O lisping Aris-
tocrat,
When the English serfs shall trample on thy
Symbolistic Hat !
Huzza for the Time of Spurning, when they tear
each fetich down —
When the paupers smite their landlords with the
sceptre and the crown ?
When they heap up age-worn parchments in a
mighty pile and high.
And the deeds of a dukeling’s freehold go blazing
’thwart the sky !
Far better the days of Chaucer than Austin’s
pinchbeck times.
When the English landlords batten on the fruit
of a thousand crimes !
So huzza for that Day of Spurning, when the
landlord-joss lies flat,
And the pauper welts the landscape with his
owner’s Burnished Hat!
Replace the lid of England—we have gazed in the
seething rat;
We have spied out England's secret —the secret
of England's fat!
We have seen the starving paupers who shiver
athwart the night;
And these are the pride of England—of the proud
old race and white ?
Aye, these are the ghastly secret —these homeless
forms that crawl
Through the windswept streets of London on the lee
of the palace wall.
Lo ! these hare produced her stoutness—yea , these
have supplied her fat—
How long will they feed the landlord who struts in
a Heavenly Hat ?-

A Bit of London
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WE saw It from the river as we
steamed slowly up. The Kentish
coast was in our wake, and 600
Australians streamed on deck and looked fixedly
at the sky above.
It was not fog nor smoke we beheld, neither
was it river haze. It seemed to hang from the
sky in a solid, elephant-colored mass. A pair of
strong field-glasses revealed what lay beyond—-a
vast, illimitable expanse of roofs and bridges
overhung by a canopy of livid fumes.
“Surely this must be Etna or Pompeii,” said
someone. “That stuff isn t smoke. It s ashes!
“ It’s London all right! ” a big-voiced bushman
pushed forward through the crowd. “You
couldn’t ringbark the blamed atmosphere with an
axe.”
Here it was at last, sprawling east and west,
clinging like an unclean devil to the heels of
Father Thames. London ought to be painted in
masses. You must speak of its legions, not its
types; audit is dirty beyond the dreams of the
wildest Bohemian.
Think of it, comrades outback, a city scoured
by the ashes of a million hearths and smoke
stacks—a city where the black grime settles on
your window pane at dawn and stifles your
breath. If one lived for a year under the hip of
Stromboli or Etna one might acquire a taste for
London. For weeks after landing we felt no
movement in the air—only the pressure of the
elephant-hued atmosphere.
And the metal-eyed little cockney woman who
steals our coal leans over the back-yard fence,
and asks us whether we are enjoying the really
beautiful weather.
In Australia, while travelling from Menindie
to Broken Hill, I met children who had never
seen rain. In the narrow lanes within the heart
of the East end of London it is possible to meet
men who have never felt the sun on their pallid
faces.
And yet the smoke-kippered little cockney
possesses a low-grade vitality that pulls him,
coughing and sneezing, through his horrible
winter. Wherever you turn there are hospitals,
black-faced and smoke-charred. Wait for a
moment outside, and watch the procession of
casualties streaming in. Here’s a man from the
Bakerloo tube almost cut in halves by the wheels of
a car. Five passengers from a capsized motor-car
are rushed in. Then comes the city ambulance
with the latest horror—three men asphyxiated in
the giant sewers.
A moment later a troop of hussars amble
towards Piccadilly, their wine-red cloaks floating
about their saddles, their plumes aslant in the fog-
smeared sunlight. Reefing and plunging, they go
through Leieester-square towards Mew Bond-
street, where the beautiful, tight-booted women
limp from their victorias, kissing their silken-
haired spaniels.
Many Englishwomen are beautiful even when
they are old, but these do not belong to London.
They come from the provinces, where the white
winters have reddened their blood and prepared
them for the ogres who live in the grey-faced
mansions beyond Westminster.
The Londoner is the most tolerant man on
earth. He is more tolerant than the Kanaka or
the Hebrew, more indifferent to your affairs than
a Chinaman or a whale. In Australia I have
been insulted and twitted a dozen times in one
morning on account of my negligent tie or the tilt
of my perspiring hat. In the Strand and Hyde
Park, London, I have seen Frenchmen from
Algiers wearing balloon-hipped trousers drawn
tight about the ankles, and as they strode along
no one turned or cast a look in their direction.
An Egyptian official, in a frock-coat and scarlet
fez, walks through the city unnoticed. Big-
beamed Dutchmen, fresh from the Ostend rabbit
boats, collide with the kippered cockney ; a swift
apology happens, and they pass.
Mew shapes and sensations stalk through
London every day, new forms of journalism, new
styles of cross-heading and type-display. To-day
they are producing “The Typhoon” at the
Hippodrome, a whirlwind play that smashes
steamboats and roots up the river from its bed.
To-morrow the heart of London will ache for a
portable Niagara or an African sirocco served up
behind the footlights, with acres of real Sahara
sand blowing into the orchestra.
Move from the city and you meet the kindly,
red-cheeked English whose hearts are strangely
indifferent to the bawbees or the clank of the
bullion-heap.
The streets are crowded with unemployed
artisans discharged from the Woolwich Arsenal
under Haldane’s new scheme of retrenchment.
Hundreds of them are finding billets in Germany
at the big gun-factories and depdts. Every dis-
charged Woolwich workman carries to Germany
the brains of a new torpedo or some secret of a
Dreadnought’s gun-room or structural defect.
If the Germans bombarded London, their siege-
guns would kill a Hebrew every nine seconds, a
Dago every twenty minutes, an Englishman every
hour, and a Scotchman once a week. At the end
of a’six months’ siege there would be 859,753
Hebrews left to claim damages for the loss of
their loan-offices and whelk-shops.
Statisticians may demur as to the correctness of
the Scotch fatalities in the above statement, but
the majority will agree that my Hebrew figures
are bed rock.
The legs of the average London horse appeal to
the sympathetic Australian visitor. The ceaseless
hammering along macadamised streets causes the
knees to “ mushroom ” and curve outward. I
recently attended an auction sale of ’bus horses
displaced by the London poison-car companies.
The sale was held in a reeking shed at the back
of St. Martin’s Lane. The horses, 800 in number,
were drafted in lots of 100 each. First lot offered
had evidently been drawn by Frank Mahony in
an embittered mood, and their front legs bulged
like the sinews of Achilles. To give the auc-
tioneer heart, I bid £5 for the first lot—one hun-
dred in number. A terrible silence fell on the
crowd as the auctioneer threw down his hammer
and looked at me.
“ For God’s sake, don’t come here blighting our
sales!” he said. The first lot, mostly wind-
broken and leg-smashed, went for £2O per head,
while many of the better stamp of ’bus haulers
fetched £4O.
“ Look at that lot! ” The auctioneer indicated
a troop of sore backs and swollen knees triumph-
antly. “ Look at ’em, gentlemen ! They’re fit
for the Household Cavalry.”
And nobody laughed. _

“ I was in a very weak condition, had
no appetite, and could not sleep. After
trying several so-called cures, I began
with Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, and it did me
so much good that I took, in all, ten
bottles. It was the cheapest in the end,
as it cured me entirely. I now make it
a practise to take three or four bottles
during the year, and it keeps me in good
working order. I can honestly recom-
mend it to other like sufferers, as I feel
'sure it will cure them as it did me.”—
- HokAce Mabsden, Adelaide, S. A.
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla has been
tried and tested in every way;
and there is nothing like using an old, reliable, and effective
medicine. Intelligent people do not like to experiment.
It is too dangerous. Unknown and untried medicines
often work more serious results than the disease. When
you need a Sarsaparilla, get “ AYER’S,” for it is the old-
est, strongest, and best Sarsaparilla you can buy. Hold
fast to the kind that has been tested for 60 years. For
purifying the blood, strengthening the digestion, and brac-
ing up the whole nervous system, use

BEECHAM’S
PILLS
are unique in this : that they suit you, and everybody ; and cannot
hurt anybody. It is important to have that perfect sense of
security. They are Nature’s remedy, innocent of harmful drugs,
and compounded only of pure herbs. You are not always well; few
are. This is a remedy you might take, and feel safe. The weight of
evidence is proof of this. Proof is what we have to go by. If we
prove a thing to be incomparably good we know it is good. Several
generations of other people have proved that when the system is
jaded, the faculties clouded, and unpleasant symptoms persistent,
BEECHAM’S PILLS do just what it is hoped they will do, assist
Nature to recover herself. That will give you confidence in proving
the fact for yourself. Where you have a great body of opinion, each
person saying practically that BEECHAM’S PILLS are the
BEST FOR ME,
you must accept the universal verdict. The interested testimony
of one here and there in a multitude, and no more, is inconclusive ;
it is what the multitude does. Actions speak louder than words.
Note particularly whether the multitude keeps a remedy on a near
shelf, if ills come to be ready for them. That is the real evidence.
In many thousands of homes in Australasia and across the seas,
BEECHAM’S PILLS are esteemed as the only family medicine for
those common ills, almost periodic in these days, arising from
defective action of the liver, kidneys and stomach. That is a habit
which speaks very loud. You must judge on the facts, and test
others’ experience by your own. Therefore take BEECHAM’S
PILLS yourself, on this example of others, and you will prove
them to be the
BEST FOR YOU.

** If I were asked which single medicine I should
prefer to take abroad with me, as likely to be
most generally useful, to the exclusion of all
others, I should say Chlorodynk. I never travel
without it, and its general applicability to the
relief of a large number of simple ailments forms
