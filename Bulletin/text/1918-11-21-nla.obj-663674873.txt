BEFORE THE MIRROR
By “JEANNETTE.”
These are, undoubtedly, days of exceptional nervous strain for one and
all of us. Anxiety, with its beauty-destroying influence, is casting its shadow
over the lives of many of us women, and while perhaps a few the more
stoical among us—can avoid worrying over past or prospective events,
may all, with a little care and forethought, succeed in preventing the result
of worry from being noticeable in our appearance. To these fortunate
few this little chat will, however, be as interesting and instructive as to
those who stand in real need of help in toilet matters, and mav be the
means of bringing to their notice some hitherto unknown method ‘of retain-
ing or regaining that beauty of face and figure which is the birthright of
every woman. Some of the ingredients mentioned below are at present not
generally known to the public, but any good chemist will usually be found to
have a small quantity in stock.
Freckles and How to Cure Them.—lt is always
those with the finest and fairiest* skins who
freckle most easily, but this knowledge is poor
comfort when the face is disfigured with these
ugly little blemishes. To prevent the forma-
tion of freckles a wash should be applied to
the face which will form a shield from the
rays of the sun. A simple and inexpensive one
can be made up at home by dissolving an
ounce of cleminite in four tablespoonfuls of
hot water. Shake the bottle, and when cold
apply to the face and allow' to dry on the
skin. If this is done every day. renewing the
application whenever the face is washed, and
a little mereolised wax rubbed into the skin
every night, freckles will not make their
appearance, no matter how hot the sun. To
remove freckles which have already formed,
apply the wax every night, rub it well into
the skin of the face and neck and leave it on
till the morning. Then wash off, using Pilenta
soap and warm water. ~*
To Reduce a Double Chin.—To reduce a double
chin, give hard, flrip massage every night with
mereolised wax, stroking the flesh firmly back-
w'ards from the chin towards the lower por-
tion of the neck. Do this every night, and in
the morning bathe wdth cold water and rub
into the skin a little parsidlum jelly. This
treatment will strengthen the flabby tissues
and restore the contour of the face. Occasion-
ally a double chin is due to stooping over
books or work, blit generally it is the result
of putting on weight. When tbe latter is the
case a few' clynol berries, eaten regularly everv
day, will greatly assist in reducing the super-
fluous flesh. A glass of hot water should be-
sipped after each meal.
The Hair—To Increase the Growth. —To arrest
an undue falling of the hair and increase the
growth, scalp-massage and the application of
a good tonic is absolutely necessary. Part the
flair in the centre, and, starting at the fore-
head, massage for at least ten minutes. Then
apply a tonic. A simple and inexpensive one
can be made up at home by mixing one ounce
of boranium (which can be bought at the
chemist’s) with a quarter of a pint of bay
rum. Add the boranium to the bay rum, allow
<o stand for half an hour, then strain and add
sufficient water to make half a pint. I)a*>
amongst the roots of the hair with a soft
sponge.
Superfluous Hair.—Dark-complexioned women
arc far more frequently troubled with a
growth of superfluous hair than those with
fair skins, and at the first sign of these objec-
tionable hairs steps should be taken to remove
diem, or they will develop into a strong growth
which will take a very long time to destroy.
A little powdered pheminol applied to this
growth will remove the unsightly blemish,
destroying it permanently if the hairs be but
few. Two or more applications may be neces-
sary, if the growth ho unusually strong, but
about one ounce of pbeminol should be suffici-
ent for the most stubborn ease. Pheminol can
be obtained at the chemist’s, and a little
powdered alum should he obtained at the
same time for dusting the skin before applying
the pbeminol.
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
TO DARKEN THE EYEBROWS (L.M.).—
There is no dye which I could recommend as
“safe,” but if you rub a little mennaline into
the eyebrows and at the roots of the eyelashes
regularly every night it will darken them
naturally, and will also increase the growth
of the eyelashes.
TO REDUCE WEIGHT (SADIE). —Yes, your
weight and measurements are certainly more
than they should be for your height, and I
quite agree that being so stout makes you look
old. I am pleased, to be able to tell you of a
quick, easy and pleasant way to reduce both.
Get a small quantity of clynol berries from
the chemist’s and take one after each meal,
three times a day. Weigh yourself after one
month’s treatment, and you will be delighted
with the result.
TO KEEP THE HAIR FAIR (DORIS).—If
you shampoo your hair regularly with stallax
granules it will prevent it from turning dark
One teaspoon of stallax is sufficient for a
shampoo, and an original packet will make
from >25 to 30 shampoos. Stallax keeps
indefinitely. [4
TO IMPROVE A DULL, MUDDY COM-
PLEXION (D. 8.). —Your complexion is dull
and muddy-looking because it needs thorough
cleansing and renewing of the outer cuticle.
To do this get a tin of mercolised wax-, and
with the tips of the fingers rub a little gently
into the skin, going over the entire face and
neck. Leave the wax on all night and in the
morning wash it off with a good soap (you
will find Pilenta excellent). In a month’s time
you will notice a most surprising improve-
ment. (2) Liquid pergol will prevent the
excessive perspiration of which you complain.
(3) Nothing can be done.
TO ARREST GREY NESS (FLO).—You are
indeed far too young to go grey yet. Gel
about two ounces of concentrate of tamma-
lite and mix it with three ounces of bay rum.
Dab thus on the hair and amongst the roots.
It will soon make matters all right.
TO WHITEN A BROWN NECK (W.K.).—To
whiten your neck use jettaline. Get a tube of
this from the chemist’s and rub a little well
into the skm of the neck: leave it on till next
morning. Do this regularly every night for
three or four weeks and you will find that the
R];'n will become Kenntifully clear and white.

The Red Page
The Book of Last-Ditch Kings
This is a work to be written after the
cleaning up of the debris of the war, and if
it is written with an understanding mind and
a broad nib it will throw a side-light on the
spread of republicanism. Sundry kings will
vanish out of the list at the cleaning up, and
in some cases their kingdoms will vanish
likewise. And not one of them shows signs
of going according to the best old rules
the game. Kings existed in the first plac
because the device of Representative Goveri
ment was too complicated for primitive time
and they were hereditary in most cases In
cause it seemed cheaper to risk the old man
son being a bad lot than to have the crow
fought for by a dozen bad lots who wer
other old men’s sons. It was understood i
strenuous days that the monarch should b
a valiant general even if he was a very bac
one; also that he should be a bitter-ender anc
a last-ditcher, lie was supposed to go dow
with the ship, lie might do no earthly gooc
by going down with the ship, but it was
line showy thing to do. It proved that th
ruler viewed his job seriously ; that he wa
willing to take the rough and the- smooth
together and to share pot-luck with the hum
blest of his followers when the pot wa
empty; that he thought he had done hi
duty, and wasn’t afraid to meet Gott or th
other fellow. The chance to exit amid
blaze of fireworks came at rare intervals, bu ;
the habit of seizing it when it came proppec
up an institution which might otherwise
have fallen into disrepute much earlier. I
was more dignified than fleeing to Englanc
under the name of “Mr. Smith” after the
manner of Louis Phillippe, the citizen king
with the cotton umbrella.
Not one of the royalties who are gone or
going attempted to live up to the specific,-!
tions. The institution has lost its glitter and
its punch.
The latest last-ditcher who filled the bill
to perfection was Constantine Palaeologus, of
Constantinople, and he bitter-ended at
Constantinople in 1453. which was a
long time. ago. All the ear-marks were
there in his case ; the name was blown in the
bottle and the capsule was intact. He was tin
seventh of his line, so he was no upstart; anc
he represented a State which was 2200 years
old. so it also was no upstart. He was
fairly young, with a face and figure that the
flappers of Byzantium loved to look upon,
and lie was unmarried, so maidens languished
after him. The empire which he inherited
consisted, apart from some isolated frag-
ments, of one big city in a condition of
chronic semi-siege by an overwhelming
enemy, and its only -approach by sea was in
the hands of the same enemy. Thus he
couldn’t be blamed for the downfall; it was
the work of his predecessors. The people
of the big city had mostly taken to religion
and relied firmly on divine protection, so
when the emperor called for Soldiers the
local Judd and Brookfield and John Storey
only enlisted to the extent of a few thou-
sands. Even the knowledge that they would
hi sold as slaves if captured, and the fact
that the one big gun of the world was drop-
ping shot into the city, didn’t move them
They said an angel would interpose.
No one ever mistook Constantine Palteolo-
gus for a great statesman or soldier, but he
had a plain simple idea of the divine right
of kings. It was the right to meet his frienc
Gott with the dignity Gott had given him
intact. So he refused handsome terms for
himself, and did the last-ditch act in tin
front rank. He even put on his purple rai
ment so that his followers should see that he
was there, and that the enemy might know
that they hadn’t killed one of the commoi
herd. Yet he nearly missed the point aftei
all, for there was" nothing left of his pomi
except his purple shoes sticking out of-a
heap of dead to show- that he wasn’t a mere
dead Jones.
There were other notable last-ditchers.
Harold of England, despite the drawback of
being the first as well as the last of his line,
filled the bill admirably bv dying magnifi-
cently on top of the ruins of the Saxon State,
though he wasn’t putting up an utterly hope-
less fight like Constantine. He was also
tall and handsome, and though he was mar-
ried he was beloved of the" girls—one girl
especially. And there was the difficultv
about identifying his body without which no
such episode is complete.
Roderick of Spain would have been higher
in the category if he had been younger and
hadn’t drank so hard, and pursued so many
women. He likewise perished amid the debris
of his kingdom, and he beat Harold’s record
by spreading his and his kingdom’s bitter
end over seven days’ fighting. But he broke
the rules by not leaving his body for burial.
He didn t put on his golden decorations after
the manner of Constantine, so he was just a
mass of bruised humanity and broken armor
among the heaps, and wasn’t identified—with
difficulty or otherwise.
Cleopatra played the part of the last-ditch
monarch so far as a women could. So did
Lazarus of Serbia, who died with his king-
dom on the Fiela of Blackbirds after putting
up the sort of scrap that his dignity called
for. Possibly the fact that he only called
himself Lord instead of King partly disquali-
fies him, just as Belshazzar was not quite up
to the mark through being a mere Crown
Prince. Saul’s kingdom survived him, else
lie would be in the category and very
high up. The same remark applies to scores
of others.
A Book of Last-Ditch Kings would be a
valuable work. It would show one of the
nost important reasons why the royal insti-
tution isn’t what it was and is never likely
to be again.

Sanctuary.
White shells on the long sand
And a long light on the sea ;
The far hills with a warm hand
Beckoning to me.
Out there would I softly go,
Cape and island between;
With a faint wind to whisper low
Out of places green.
It would whisper and fill a white sail
Till the yellow light of the skies
Held a star early and pale
Before the moon's rise.
But I would go away, away,
And hear the waves tread
As the great sea walked round the bay
With no word said.
I know an island that lies beyond
A reef that is white with foam.
Where the little winds blow crisp
and fond
With the sigh of home.
I would glide there to the good land,
And up and up would I go
Over brown rock arid still sand
To the place I must know.
For there would be a window high
And in it a yellow light;
And, oh, my heart would have wings
to fly
Up the steps of the night!
Brown steps with the scent of the
trees
And the sweet of the moving tide;
And the fern rustling about my knees
In the dusk kind and wide.
But within would be books that a
man might, read
And pens and a horn of ink ;
And a little space for a man’s need
That his own soul might think.
And there would I stay many days
And watch the suns set,
With fine thoughts God to praise
For more thoughts yet.

The Heiress.
My mother wore a. green shawl
To Fair and Holy Mass,
And shining white the fall
Of her bare feet through the grass.
Her lips were like the cherry, her skin like
the good milk.
And her curls beneath the old shawl blew
soft and fine as silk.
My father had the good farm
Upon the steep glen side.
His house was whole and warm,
And his fields two acres wide.
The strength of ten was in him, his head
was carried high,
As beseems a man to do whose tongue has
known no lie.
My mother in her green shawl
Stepped through the twilight grey,
With low cry or shrill call
To make her cows obey.
She smiled upon my father with eyes set
wide apart.
To prove the sweetness of her, and the grace
within her heart.
’Twas not red gold or rich lands
They won, nor meed of fame.
But they left me two strong hands,
And a word that none might blame,
And a twilit glen of dreams from the hard
world set apart,
Where all the songs of Ireland go singing in
my heart.

“Good-bye.”
A thousand years ago you sailed away—
A thousand years—or was it yesterday
I stood alone and, o'er the sunlit sea,
I watched the transport bearing you from
me?
The women near me sobbed and waved and
smiled —
Brave smiles with lips that trembled with
the wild
Fierce hunger of their hearts. And you and I
Laughed in each other’s eyes—and they were
dry.
We spoke of little things that matter not;
Of foolish trifles and I know not what.
I listened to your low voice, strangely clear;
I only saw your face, so young, so dear.
I dared not tell you of the aching dread
That clutched my soul —the empty years
ahead,
The lonely heart within me that must break,
Fnless I held it closely for your sake.
And so we said good-bye. I saw you go;
You leant across the rail and smiled: and.
oh.
I watched you leaning, waving in the light,
Until you faded, faded from my sight.
The sea-birds skimmed and dived and circled
low.
As though they, too, were loth to let you go;
A belt of sunlight stretched across the bav.
It made my eyes ache, and I turned away.
A thousand years ago you sailed away
It seems to me. And now I know to-day
A thousand more may drift by wearily, ‘
And you will never sail back home to me.

The Perdriau Super Tread
is a New Note in Tyre Efficiency.
When we discovered the Super Tread Compound we tested
it by making a tyre shod partly with the usual tread
rubber and partly with Super Tread.
After running 3000 miles the three ribs of the former were
considerably worn, but those of the Super Tread were
still clear and sharp and the grooves as deep as ever.
That is how we first proved the great wear=resisting qualities of the Perdriau Super Tread,

THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 21, 1918.
JUDGMENT DAY.
So far as Australia was concerned, Judg-
ment Day struck on Monday, November 11.
It was also Judgment Day for the Hun, but
he is a long way off, and doesn’t call for any
sympathy from us. Besides, despite his stu-
pendous defeat, it is just possible that he
will recover sooner than we will, for his
patience and industry and ingenuity and his
capacity for organisation are great assets.
Though the times that were bad with him
during the war will be worse when he is
facing the bill for the war, it may be that the
slump and depreciation in his case won’t be
any greater than in ours. Of course, if the
population goes Bolsheviking in an utterly
reckless fashion, there is no limit to the
possibilities of disaster; but in Australia
there is also a considerable class which wants
to go Bolsheviking on the plea that it is
trodden down by the tyranny of one-adult-
one-vote, and that salvation can be only
found in the usurpation of power by an
I.W.W. or Perth Labor Conference minority.
Australia’s position is that it is driven out of
Lotus Land into the world of hard realities.
It will presently have some 200,000 or
800,000 workers back on its hands, and in
the almost complete absence of new indus-
tries it sees very little immediate employment
for them. Though local goods of all sorts
were badly wanted amid the scarcity of im-
ports, work seems to have diminished, so
that there is just enough for the community
without anybody coming back. These men
have been paid, so far as they received cash
payment while away from home, by the
British Government, which obligingly took
this country’s lOU. That payment will pre-
sently cease, though the attached interest
bill won’t; so that a pleasant little income
will be cut off. The £ 50,000,000 a year of
war-loan money—the paper “wealth” created
by the printing of war securities, and the
sale of them to the Australian people in
exchange for Australian paper money, and
the distribution of the proceeds almost
entirely in Australia, because the paper cir-
culates" nowhere else —will also cease, and
another great source of income (a sort of
income) will vanish. It was the biggest in-
dustry in the country (bigger than pasture
or agriculture), and was only rendered possi-
ble by the financial blessing of war and the
assurance that it would cease as soon as the
blessing left off. for the efforts made by banks
and other institutions to support the loans
were impossible of continuance. They repre-
sented the pace of the 400yds. sprinter which
is possible for 400yds. and quite impossible
for 10 miles. In fact, so, far from floating
new war loans the cleaning up of the flota-
tion of the old ones will be a serious under-
taking, for half the amount so gladly sub-
scribed the other day was lent by the banks
out of their deposits to the glad subscribers
for lengthy terms at low interest. In addi-
tion, the glad subscribers to the previous
loan and the more previous one haven’t yet
repaid to the banks all the cash lent them
for their patriotism. The banks are carrying
a lot of patriots these days.
The income made by the expansion of the
issue of paper money leaves off to a cer-
tainty, for there is already much more paper
in existence than so small a community has
any use for. In fact, a lot of it will have to
be redeemed in gold and put into the furnace,
like the Three Holy Children, so this source
of revenue takes the back track and becomes
a minus quantity. The record, published by
the Federal Government, is as follows:
Australian Notes in Existence.

1917 .. 47,901,269 1,240,807
October, 1918 . . 59,676,401 11,775,132
More than half the issue (over £33,000,000)
is locked up in the banks because the public
has no actual use for all the paper money.
And more than half (£31,005,000) is in
£lOOO notes, which are not the sort of change
that the public carries in its pocket to pay
for its lunch with. They are, in the main,
handy bits of paper issued to banks as secu-
rity for advances because the same amount
held in £1 notes would be too bulky. When
the war is finished the excuse for keeping
these packed away in bank cellars will dis-
appear. They must be repurchased by instal-
ments. So instead of about £10,000,000 a
year of new currency being printed, in addi-
tion to £80,000,000 of war securities, many
of which are so small as to be almost cur-
rency, there is actually a period of repay-
ment in view. In the desire to put off
Judgment Day so far as possible one or two
papers, of which more sane things were ex-
pected, notably the Sydney Telegraph, have
begun to suggest, as one of the lessons or
revelations of the war, that a gold basis for
the currency isn’t so necessary as it looks.
In fact, that a big paper issue secured on
“all the assets of the community” is feasible
after all. The best way to test the idea is
to issue a note which doesn’t bear on the
face of it the promise to pay in gold, but
to pay in wheat or meat or wool or galvan-
ised-iron, and see how it fares. The world
has a lot of currencies based on “all the
assets of the community,” except the old-
fashioned asset of a sufficient reserve in
gold—the only metal that passes current
everywhere. They are quoted as low as id.
in the dollar (4s. 2d.). Australia, in its
anxiety to avoid war taxation, has pushed
its paper currency till the total is almost
exactly £l2 per inhabitant, against less than
£9 in the United Kingdom, so there is more
than the average amount of inflation to be
made good in cash. At the same time its
stock of gold has diminished, while that of
the Ma country has increased wonderfully.
* * * *
Many people pin great hopes to the re-
moval of war-taxe?, but it is difficult to see
how war-taxes can be taken off, Seeing that
they were never put on. Taxes have cer-
tainly been levied to pay interest 6n war
loans, but these are permanent. Taxes have
been levied to pay pensions to war-widows
and others, but these are also permanent—
at least as permanent as the widows are.
The idea that Australia has been paying
a lot of actual war charges out of revenue
in the British or United States sense is a
delusion. Australia isn’t built that way. The
N. S. Wales State Government certainly put
on a war-tax, just as it would have put on a
tax to pay for facilitating the transit of Venus,
or developing a new comet, if the idea had
struck it; but the State Government wasn’t
running any war. It only wanted the money
to pay for several thousand new civil ser-
vants and for Minister Beeby’s trip to the
United States, or something like that. Then
there is a certain uplifting of soul because
many million bushels of stranded wheat may
now get away at last; but the wheat has
been already paid for, and the transaction is
merely the delivery of belated and rather
deteriorated goods. In fact, the only return
Australia seems likely to get out' of the
peace is the return of two or three hundred
thousand men. They are a magnificent asset
if there is work for them to do, but if this
empty land of “boundless natural resources”
has hardly any work, then they will be so
many encumbrances and might as well be
100,000 parsons or half a million kings.
There is wild talk of building houses for
returned soldiers at a cost of £75.000,000
loan money, though what they would do
when they are in the houses doesn’t appear,
nor is it explained what has become of the
houses that they lived in before they went
away. There is also vague discourse about
putting 4000 soldiers (which doesn’t seem
many) on N. S. Wales land (which is dry)
inside two years (which is a long time) at
a cost of about £4,000,000 of loan money
(which is a dreadful lot of loan money). But
putting a man on the land is no more an
assured means of livelihood than putting
him on a roof or an island. Everybody talks
of putting the returned, soldiers on the land,
just as the fool of the English squire’s family
used to be “put into the Church” and the
waster “sept out to the colonies.”
* * * *
It is Judgment Day, or rather judgment-
summons day, and the community which has
been wallowing in the luxury of war and
drawing big paper dividends from it. and
spending them on imported goods instead of
on factories and machinery, is about to come
up against the reality of things. It doesn't
look a pleasing reality. In fact it looks so
depressing that the country at once left off
doing any productive work for two davs to
think over it. Even some. laundries left off.
so that the community had to partly rejoice
in a dubious shirt.
THE NEW MAP OF EUROPE.
In 1914 there were six Great Powers in
Europe, liut only three of them will be alive
in 1919 or 1920, unless something unex-
pected and almost impossible happens to the
war settlement. The prospect is full of con-
solation, for on the whole Great Powers have
been a great nuisance. It is a fact which
requires some assimilation that only two of
the outstanding continental Powers, France
and Italy, are genuine. Their peoples speak
one language, and all do so willingly and
none under compulsion. They voluntarily
obey one Government, and no racial qualifi-
cation disqualifies any section from an equal
share in the making of the Government. If
there were widely divergent races among them
once—and the Norman and the Gascon were
once as far apart as the Sicilian and the Lom-
bard—the discrepancy has been forgotten.
Malcontents there are in plenty, but they are
not the kind that want to break away and form
separate States like the Poles and Czechs,
or to break away and attach themselves to
other States like the Prussian Danes and
the Alsace-Lorraine folk, or the Roumanians
and Serbs and Italians of Austria. And
both France and Italy have made life suffi-
ciently attractive to have outside peoples
knocking at the door and asking to be taken
in, which doesn’t happen to their three mas-
sive contemporaries. The troubles of the
three massive contemporaries are with
peoples inside who are trying to burst the
door so that they may get out.
* * * «•
_ The last date- when the whole map of
Europe was revised and everything fixed for
ever and ever was a little over 100 years ago
at the close of the Napoleonic troubles. The
settlement went on the general principle of
handing every small nation to the master
whom it least wanted, and always harnessmg
an ox and an ass together if the animals
were available. Norway was given to Swe-
den. Belgium was hitched on to Holland,
and an uncouth fool set over them. Greece
was re-established in its position as Turkish
property. The kingdom of Italy was broken
up and given partly to Austria and partly
to local tyrants, none of it being given to
anybody who had a real friend in the world.
Poland was re-divided among parties whom
it hated with a unanimous hatred. Prussia
received a lot of places in which it wasn’t
popular, but that is not remarkable, for it
never was popular anywhere. Russia
secured a horde of Finns amid the confusion.
A settlement-60 years later took a vast quan-
tity of Serbs from Turkey and gave them
to Austria. In fact, all the old arrange-
ments consisted in giving people to kings,
provided the kings were ‘big enough. Napo-
i.eon 111. had at least one bright idea in his
shoddy brummagem career; he was the first
monarch of any size who advanced the theory
that boundaries should be drawn according
to the distribution of races, and that peoples
counted for more than potentates. He was
a short-legged anomaly of doubtful parent-
age ; in fact almost the only evidence that
he was a Bonapakte lay in the fact that he
died of the same stomach disease as his illus-
trious alleged uncle. He fought one war to
prop up the Unspeakable Turk, and another
to force an Austrian emperor on the infuri-
ated populace of Mexico, and he took up the
case of Italy, chiefly because Italy’s oppres-
sor had been uncivil to him. Still, he advo-
cated by word of mouth the unpopular idea
that nationalities should count, which was
something to his credit.
If a settlement is made, as seems almost
certain, on the principle that nationalities
really do count, much old geography and his-
tory will die out. It will be for Europe the
day of respectable second-class States. France
and Italy, both enlarged by the restoration
of the provinces which demand union, or
rather re-union, with them, should rank first
and second among Continental Powers.
Poland, if it can learn the hitherto unknown
art of self-government, might be third, or
else the third place might be held by a new
German State of real Germans. This pro-
position is based on the theory that the
Prussian, who isn’t and never was a real
German, but only a hard and boorish
intruder, will be left by himself with
such. lands as are inhabited by the
genuine and wholly undesirable Prussian
people. Russia, barring the apparently-
assured loss of Finland as well as its Polish
provinces, is an unknown quantity, but it
looks as if it might become a place of minor
importance.. The features of the European
map to which the eye will almost certainly
have to grow accustomed are the appearance
of Serbia, Bohemia and Roumania, ranking
with Spain or perhaps higher than Spain,
among second-class Powers; an enlarged
Greece—-the fact that Salonika and much
adjacent land had become Greek had hardly
time to soak in before the new war diverted
attention —also a good second-class Power;
andgtKe re-appearance, after long eclipse, of
pm independent Magyar State, only very
small by reason of the loss of its oppressed
fringe. Both Serbia and Poland have a
prospect of being maritime States, though the
Pole has such an unspeakable record of
failure that it is difficult to imagine him
becoming anything new. In fact, the prospect
is. that nothing on . the map of Europe
will be quite what it was save those old
landmarks, Portugal, Spain, the British
Isles, Norway and Sweden. Even the out-
lines of Belgium, Holland and Switzerland
may shift a little, especially, those of the last
named, for the Austrian province of Vorarl-
berg is already ringing the bell hard and
asking to be taken in out of the cold, wet
places where there are indemnities to pay.
Switzerland is a cosmopolitan spot, and
almost any fairly precipitous place is eligible
for membership. An exciting feature of the
case is that every fragment of the two motley
Ilun empires which can put up a decent pre-
tence of alien birth will naturally be anxious
to break away from the place that has
damages to pay if any country which has
damages to collect will take it in. The out-
standing criminals for whom there is no for-
giveness are the Prussian, the Austrian, the
Magyar and the Turk. (Bulgaria is a
criminal, but it doesn’t outstand.) Every
subject race which can plead compulsion, and
advance a claim to be accepted as King's
evidence will presumably file its bill for
divorce immediately.
Possibly a number of small races with
some affinity of language and pedigree may
drift together in time, and form a new Great
Power with the bond of a common hatred of
their old proprietors to cement the brother-
hood. But the immediate future in Europe
looks like the time of the second-class family
States. There promises t 0 be an unusual
scarcity of sovereigns, which will remove a
serious disturbing element. Nearly half the
woes of a very troubled continent have arisen
through one king s son marrying another
king’s daughter, and thereby establishing a
claim to the succession which was disputed
by the queen’s uncle or some such relative.
There have been annoyances and civil wars
through sovereigns marrying too often, or
marrying near relatives, or marrying people
who were married already (the third hus-
band of Mary of Scotland was alleged to
have three other wives living, and, besides,
their child was born very suddenly, and the
third husband was alleged to have murdered
the second one). And in addition, there
have been all manner of upheavals through
sovereigns not marrying, or leaving no chil-
dren or mad children oi‘ only female chil-
dren. Fifty years ago there was only one
republic in Europe that counted. Last year
there were three, and one had been born'and
died in the interim. Last week, if the cable-
grams didn’t lie, there were 30 or perhaps
300, so the good work goes on. If the new
map of Europe consists in the main of re-
spectable medium-sized Commonwealths it
should be a good document with some chance
of permanence.
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
£55 11s. 2d. AND £34 10s. 8d.
This is a time when the world, in a manner
of speaking, starts afresh, so it may he a
good occasion to consider what our bit of the
world is living on and what it may expect
to live on. Rejoicings are pleasant though
dusty. The feeling that the cause of human-
ity has triumphed has points about it. And
there are no flies on the knowledge that the
human race, which is really an indispensable
institution (indispensable to us, that is, for
no substitute would quite fill the bill) lias
averted the greatest danger that has threat-
ened it since the anxious days of 451, when
Aetius, the Foch of his day, held high
debate with the same enemy' on the same
ground. But these matters being settled, the
simple local question of the local crust
obtrudes itself. The exact details of Aus-
tralia’s sustenance this year are not avail-
able, for the figures are intricate and can’t
be computed in a day. But in the following
estimate the value of work done is set down
a c co rdiiig to the latest-known figures, those
of 191 G. It was a good year, when the ship-
ping scarcity hadn’t got to the worst, and
prices wteye high, and there were rather more
adult malted workers in the country than there
are now. On that basis the 1918 record will
be as follows :—■
Wiiat Australia Lived Ox in 1918.
federal Loans expended locally (about) £80,000,000
State Loans expended locally (about).. 12,000,000
further issue of paper money (figures
to 31/10/’lB only) .. .. .. 11,775,132
Total Borrowings (apart from upkeep
of forces at the Front) .. ..£'103,775,132
Pastoral Production £89.940,000
Manufacturing 64,205,000
Agriculture 60,207,000
Lows, Hens, Bees, and other small deer 26,949,000
Mining , . 23,621,000
Trees, fish, etc 5,505,000
Total of Non-Borrowing Industries.. £270,427,000
* * *
This naturally leads to another table of
figures
Total amount available—including Loans £374,202,132
Less payable for imports
( ab °ut) £77,000,000
Less Interest, Rents and
Dividends payable abroad
( sa T) 23,000,000
£274,202,132
So the record will probably show that in
1918 Australia had £274,000,000 of value or
apparent value to spend locally, provided it
didn t lay anything aside for the repair and
replacement of the machinery of production.
This is £170,000,000 of the products of actual
work, after paying for imported goods and
meeting foreign debt liabilities; and nearly
£104,000,000 of the imaginary and temporary
asset created by the printing of bits of paper
which are as good as gold (or copper) so
long as the community believes them to be as
good as gold (or copper). The result pans
out at £55 11s. 2d. per inhabitant for the
year, of which £34 10s. Bd. is earned and
£ll os. 6d. is borrowed or raised in one way
and another on the public credit, which is in
the main a matter of leaving the bill to that
overburdened hack, Posterity. The amount
of money or value or assumed value avail-
able for spending puts Australia on the level
of a really rich country. The amount of
actually earned value available after paying
f. 01 i .luxurious imports and the annual
liability for bygone revelry shows it to be
quite a poor country—it might almost be
called a dashed poor country. That is to
I s poor in results, which is quite
different from being poor in possibilities.
At present ‘the question of wages, working
hours, imports, and especially the question
of the country’s capacity to maintain its sys-
tem of government on a scale which puts
Solomon and Nebuchadnezzar in the shade,
are calculated on the basis of £55 11s. 2d.,
when they should be reckoned on the basis of
£34 10s. Bd. There is a sizable precipice
between _ the two figures. But for the
old habit of “importing capital to develop
the resources of the country,” and the pathe-
tic reliance on foreigners to make our goods
for us on the plea of our natural incapacity
and imbecility, the country would have pro-
bably £SO per annum per inhabitant of its
very own, which would be above the world's
average. And there is no reason why it
shouldn’t have £IOO per annum if the capa-
city which is now stifled by the habit of
leaving all skilled work to foreigners was
developed. It is skill as expressed in
machinery that really counts, not brute


force, or “direct action," or the crude putting
of people on the land. This fact has alieady
been demonstrated in a small way in N.•
Wales; the value of the machinery supplied
bv the employer nearly trebled between I.KJI,
and 1917, with the result that the average
wage per employee went up about 00 per cent.
With the machinery of 1902 the wages or
1917 would have been impossible, for they
would have eaten up more than the entire
output. This holds out a real hope that the
community may get above the hungry basis
of £34 10s. Bd., but this can’t be done by the
“influx of capital from abroad to develop the
country,” which is the matter about which
the daily press is now most concerned. This
country could find £20,000,000 of new capi-
tal every year to create new industries by
simply cutting that amount off the extrava-
gant imports, but there is a prevailing idea
here that capital isn’t capital unless some
outsider owns it. That is one of the many
causes of the sum of money which looks like
£55 11s. 2d. and is only £34 10s. Sd.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Federal Woollen Mill.
A day or two before the Great News trans-
pired Defence Minister Pearce appeared
unable to give more than a perfunctory
answer to a question on which it is now up
to him to supply some copious information.
He had been asked whether, in view of the
obvious earlv termination of the war, the
output from Federal woollen factory
would be made available for public consump-
tion. Pearce’s reply was that the matter
would leceive consideration, but the soldiers
would require clothing for a long time yet.
Since then events have happened with such
great swiftness as to materially reduce the
length of time Pearce was thinking about,
and to make reasonable a request for Pearce
to produce the arithmetic. It is not very
likely that the Australian troops in the field
will need much further additions to their field
wardrobe than can be supplied from the ser-
vice stores. It is certain that the demand
in the days immediately to come will, so far
as the soldier goes, turn upon the material
out of which the civilian suit some of him
accepts on being paid oft is made. Wherefore
it seems to this paper that if Pearce entered
into an exDlanation of how much material
is on hand and how much more will be
required for the garb of peace, a lot of useful
light would be shed on a matter of much
public importance. This woollen factory
belongs to the public, not to Pearce, and the
public has an interest in it that is both
practical and academic. For some weird
reason detailed information about the out-
put of the factory has been kept in cold
storage. But enough is known in a general
way to make it clear that in this enterprise
the Commonwealth has an undertaking of
great value to Australia. It represents a
capital investment of £160.000, and without
attempting to make war profits shows a very
decent profit on working. During last year
raw material valued at £BS,RSI was con-
verted into the finished article, the output
for 12 months ended June, ’l7, being some-
where about a half-million yards of khaki
cloth and blue serge. One particular point
of interest about this is that a suit of pure
wool cloth can (according to Royal Commis-
sioners Mcßeatii and Yerco) be supplied to
the soldier-civilian for “no more than was
previously paid for a suit made from cotton
and shoddy imported cloth.” Inspection of
the cost at which the clothing factory is able
to produce other articles of clothing, on a
basis of good wages and a profit, shows
material for some rather staggering compari-
sons between cost of production and the pre-
vailing price for raiment exacted from the
Australian citizen by P. Enterprise. Is
there any reason for supposing that after
Billjim has ceased to be a soldier he will
not want suits? This paper knows of none,
nor does it know of any for thinking that he
would not prefer the local article. Is there
any reason why this mill should not be en-
larged to double or four times the size and
the output correspondingly increased? Or
to the management devoting itself to, among
other things, the job of producing materials
which in point of quality and price will chal-
lenge comparison with the output of any mill
in the world? If there are any such reasons
The Bulletin would like to know what
they are. In the meantime it would put to
Pearce very .seriously the proposal that he
should issue an invitation to the Ministry
to begin to think of this factory and its
future as a national asset of enormous value,
and to realise that in relation to the woollen
industry Australia has for far too long let
opportunity slip past.
The Occasional Vainness of £ s. d.
Wheeled in under protection of the Red
Flag : —-
Melbourne Age seems to be afflicted with dread
that the Australian worker may become obsessed
with an anxiety to turn Socialist. It seems a
queer sort of dread, this, in view of the fact that
the Australian worker has for over 20 years been
declaring that he is a Socialist —that Socialism is
and always has been the declared objective of
the Australian Labor Party—and that the Aus-
tralian Labor press has been preaching Socialism
(among other things) ever since Billy Lane sys-
tematised the sermon in Bananaland. Most likely
the dread is that alleged Socialists may begin to
think like Socialists instead of talking the pernici-
ous Capitalist blither most of them hereabouts
have for so long been guilty of. Anyway, with a
view to convincing the proletariat by the Yarra
that Socialism is merely another term for madness
the Age came out the other day with a solemn
warning. It took this form: —
The total production from all industries during
1915 was £251,589,000, equal to an average of
£5O 16s. 6d. per inhabitant. Now if we deduct
from this total, as is done in England, 20 per
cent, for renewals and repairs and extended invest-
ments, it brings down the divisible product to £4O
per inhabitant, or say 15s. 6d. per week to every-
body. A man with a wife and three children would
get a dividend of £3 17s. 6d.; with a wife and
two children, £3 2s. A man with a wife only
would get £1 11s. That is how the universal equal
dividend would work out in Australia, if we were
to abolish the capitalist and gave something to
everybody, share and share alike. Of course, the
supposition is a mad one, because there can never
be an equality in remuneration between the office-
boy and the highly-skilled manager of a complex
business. But it is informative in showing that
such a distribution would be quite as unpalatable
to the thousands of skilled workpeople who are
earning from £4 to £5 per week as it would be
welcome to the deadbeats who have not for years
earned a meal in a week.
Whether anybody in Victoria is going to be con-
verted from Socialism or prevented from assimilat-
ing the doctrine by arithmetic of that sort can
only be a matter of speculation. Apparently the
Age imagines that both events are likely to occur.
But it . happens that such calculations and such
arguments were long ago abandoned, even in Pots-
dam, mainly because the criticism is not a criticism
of Socialism but of the figment of the imagination.
And in any case the figures are hopelessly muddled.
Supposing for a moment it to be true that Socialism
means “equality of remuneration” between the office-
boy and his boss, and a sharing out of equal divi-
dends on the basis of the year’s production expressed
in the terms of the company's balance-sheet. Well,
it may, in a spirit of most earnest brotherhood, be
pointed out that in the year 1915, in addition to
the £251,589,000 available for distribution, there
happened to be also the whole Australian continent
to carve up. Wherefore the man with a wife and
three children who got £3 17s. 6d. a week plus
a large lump of the earth might not be looked
on with quite so much compassion by the potentate
who once earned £4 or £5 as the Age imagines.
Indeed, it is not inconceivable that the latter
might not want to go looking for the old job any
more. 'But all these nebulous schemes of “division,”
whether evolved by foolish Socialists on soap-boxes
or erudite editors on paper, are just plain
punk. Socialism offers no cut and dried
scheme. It points to the inevitable collapse
of the Capitalist system of production for profit
through wages. That is the beginning and end of
the thing. It suggests as an alternative to chaos
the production for use instead of profit, and distri-
bution for the common good. The individual who
starts up to unfold a scheme by which a citizen
may get 75 microscopes or a belfry or 17s. 6d. a
week is merely a noisy impostor who has not taken
the trouble to master his brief. Socialism is full
of all sorts of holes —but the one the Age has dis-
covered is emphatically not one of them. The
difficulties incidental to evolving a Socialistic dis-
tribution of commodities are stupendous. They
may possibly be unsolvable. Meanwhile it may be
worth the attention of the anti-Socialist to notice
that there is no record yet of a people rising in
revolution as a protest against the threatened with-
drawal of the Capitalist system to another locality.
Furthermore, it might be to his advantage to take
the arithmetic quoted by the Age and explain what
outstanding elements of social justice are to be
detected in the distribution of the national earn-
ings on the existing basis of scrambling for the
last shilling. Is everything right and fair—even
reasonably decent? And take another aspect of
society, where Socialism is only a theory and the
other arrangement an inescapable fact. Inter-State
Commissioner Piddington the other day took a cruise
round some of Sydney’s slums, and they were not
the worst either. He found them horrible; found
that here in Sydney we are accumulating chunks
of the East End of London. Well, there are acres
and acres of these dismal places, and it is there
that thousands of men and women live, and more
thousands of young Australians are reared. Capital
could build those hovels, but had no money to pro-
vide anything better. Yet there was and is plenty
of money to buy labor for the erection of sky-
scraping warehouses and offices, ornate private man-
sions, picture-palaces, decorative pubs and well-
appointed abattoirs. Someone ought to explain
that Socialism would not use Labor that way, and
then, in the light of the explanation, show how
much worse off Labor would be for a change ot
effort and system. To criticise Socialism with a
ready-reckoner is to miss the answer to the problem
by a mile.
—— «
What the Board Thought of the Board.
The Public Service of the Ma State, barring
the railways (the biggest branch of all) and
some other branches, is run by a highly-paid
Board to save Ministers the responsibility
they are paid for, and the obtrusive honesty
they are also paid for. A Board was re-
cently paid to inquire into that Board. The
Board reports that it is astonished at the
things it has discovered about the Board—
things that the Premier, after eight years of
office and salary, should have found out for
himself. Possibly he did find them out, but
was too bashful to mention them. Anyhow,
the Board of one says that the Board of
three elderly men at £IOOO a year each, and
its 34 assistants, have increased or helped to
increase the N. S. Wales Public Service from
10,222 members in 1807 to 20,361 in 1017,
and that the salaries went up from £1,554,567
to £3,660,680. This was apart from the big
service, the Railways, which must increase
with the opening of new lines. The result
was owing in part to the invention of new
branches, a flourishing branch of manufac-
ture, many of them to deal with industrial
enterprises which the Government had no
right to touch until it had taken a course at
the Technical College and passed at least a
preliminary examination in accountancy. The
Government’s mistaken idea that an elocu-
tionary style and a plausible way with the
electors qualifies it to be a butcher and a
builder and a brickmaker and a joiner, and
to do everything except operate for appendi-
citis costs the country a lot of money. Some
day, when it becomes more plausible and per-
suasive, it may even operate for appendicitis.
Anyhow, the Board that the other Board
reported on was appointed to make or unmake
appointments, so that the Ministry might not
incur well-deserved suspicion through making
them itself. It is found or hinted that the
Ministry had a habit of directly or indirectly
recommending its appointees to make ap-
pointments, and that the appointees (the
Board), being dependent on the Ministry for
a renewal of its short-lived job, may have
had a tendency to give way. Itr that case,
things were much as of old, save that there
were 37 paid buffers between the Cabinet and
any liability for its acts. A suggestion made
hereabouts is that there should be one well-
paid Commissioner instead of three, and that
he should have the same tenure of office as a
Supreme Court Judge, so that he could resist
the Ministry without fear of not getting his
engagement renewed. Then if there was any 1
corruption it would be his own, and the pro-
fits, if any, would be his also. That would 1
be good, in a way, but the necessity for
putting authority into the hands of a virtual
autocrat, because the people’s representatives
can’t be trusted to have either sense or in- 1
dustry or political honesty is rather absurd.
And unless the proposed Public Service czar
could flatly refuse to find officers for the :
Ministry’s new Department of Rabbits and 1
Astrology or its Board of Ghosts’ Spiritual ;
Consolation and Illicit Distilling on the ;
ground that they are silly and corrupt jobs, 1
his value would be limited. At the most, he :
could make a withering report, but the
annual report of the Auditor-General, with 1
its denunciations of the utter contempt for :
the rules with which public money is scat-
tered, is sufficiently withering to dry up the '
grass for a mile in each direction. And
neither the Ministers who spend the money
nor the members whose constituents get it
seem to hear anybody speaking. Perhaps
Ministers of a different sort are required. At
present, the first duty of a Minister is to
dodge round the corner and get the bill dis-
counted. He is in the position of Montague
Tigg when lie acted as jackal to Chevy
Slyme and tried to borrow a trifle from
Peck'sniff. His next duty is to distribute
the proceeds where they will arouse most
good-feeling. Men whose services are worth
having don’t compete for this kind of employ-
ment, and it tends to drift into the hands of
boy politicians and persons of arrested
development.
The Senate and the Electors’ Vote.
“Carfax” : If the prevailing Federal Minis-
try can be said to be pledged to anything at
all it is to reform of the electoral law relat-
ing to the Senate. The results of the exist-
ing system are a flagrant violation of every
conceivable principle of representation.
Periodically there is a rush to the polls for
the selection of Senators, and every time the
consequences are the same, one side or the
other capturing all the vacant seats and the
other side annexing the wallop. Examined
in detail the proceedings show that 51 per
cent, of the electors who vote in any State
are in the habit of getting all the representa-
tion available, and 49 per cent, get none.
But each successive Ministry shirks the job
of ending this scandal, mainly. because if it
had not happened one way it would have
occurred another, and then the Ministry
would have omitted to come into existence.
The present crowd has an Electoral Bill on
the menu, but its provisions are drafted for
application to the House of Reps. only. Of
course it will pass. Then Australia will
have a double-barrelled system of representa-
tion, the Representatives being elected on
the preferential method of voting and Sena-
tors on the weary old sudden-death prin-
ciples, which to the elector mean x r oting with
the machine or standing aside as a spectator.
The argument in favor of preferential voting
is that it keeps out the candidate who other-
wise sneaks in on a minority vote in a three-
or four-cornered fight. The idea is mainly a
delusion. The best that can be said for the
system is that it keeps the party game going
and ensures the return of Smith if a certain
number of electors dislike him less exces-
sively than Jones or Brown. The argument
in favor of not applying a remedy "to the
Senate method of election seems to be that
the. politicians do not know where to begin.
Using the preferential, system on that Cham-
ber W6dld obviously give the same results as
■ are achieved now—or something so close to
them that there would be hardly any differ-
ence, even of a superficial kind. As a stall
AY ATT explained last week that he was im-
pressed with the objections to having two
voting systems in full blast and announced
that he had “asked the Government to con-
sider as soon as possible the question of pro-
portional representation for the Senate.” If
in their deliberations Ministers are not im-
pressed some more by objections to two sys-
tems operating on the one Legislature, it
won’t be for lack of an opportunity anyway.
Watt’s main trouble if he started to propor-
tionalise the Senate would be that, as the
institution stands, it is impossible for Aus-
tralians to get proportional representation.
All Watt could offer them would be a feeble
imitation thereof. Each State returns six
Senators. The electors on the roll for the
elections of May, 1917, were divided thus: —
N. S. Wales .. 1,094,834 South Aus. .. 235,779
Victoria .. 819,707 West Aus. .. 168,030
Bananaland .. 378,296 Tasmania .. 108,681
This gives a Senator to every 182,472 elec-
tors in N. S. Wales, and one to every 18,11 8
in the Speck. Supposing proportionalism to
be applied to an election, the result might
easily be a Senate which, while proportion-
ately balanced so far as the individual State
voting went, would be a travesty on the sys-
tem of voting. The theory of proportional
representation is the simple one that every
phase of political opinion strong enough to
secure the support of a sufficiently large
quota of votes shall return a representative.
To graft this theory on to practice in which
the representation is not of electors, but of
mere geography, would turn the whole thing
into a farce. Assuming a dissolution and
election of a completely new Senate on a
proportional basis in each State. It is only
necessary to look at the figures to see that
more than half of the electors would be dis-
franchised —that 18 Senators from the three
more-sparsely-peopled States could run a
dead-heat with 18 representing twice as
many of the proletariat. The application of
a proportional system of election to a repre-
sentative Assemldy that is founded on dis-
proportion is something like giving a citizen
the privilege of voting for a Parliament
which exists only in imagination. As long
as 108,681 Australians, who happen to live
in Tassy, can elect six Senators, and
1,094,834, who inhabit N. S. Wales, can do
no better, proportionalising the local repre-
sentation can be nothing but a farcical inver-
sion of what proportional representation
allegedly stands for.

The Troubled Transcontinental.
“Sol M.” :
“Edo” alleges (B. 31/10/’18) that “the recent
trouble on the Federal Government’s East-to-West
railway wasn’t caused through engine-drivers’ unjust
demands.” Well, certain men who were allowed to
speak for them said they would strike unless a certain
person with a foreign-sounding name got a free pass
to which he had no lawful claim, and they did strike.
Afterwards these certain or uncertain or hazy men
began to explain that it wasn’t the free pass for the
person with the foreign-sounding name, but some-
thing else" that made the trouble. By that time it
was too late to change the subject; As “Edo” says,
the trains are (or should be) the fastest in the Com-
monwealth. The line is standard gauge, new, in good
order, almost dead level, and it is claimed that it
is so straight that no other railway on earth equals
it for obstinate straightness. There are few stops
and hardly any population to run over ; and the roll-
ing stock is the best that could be found because the
line is our pride, our joy, our great national enter-
prise, our one and only transcontinental. Therefore
it is one of the easiest lines to drive on ; in fact, it
is simpler to run an express there than a mixed
caterpillar on the Blue Mountains. Certainly Nullar-
bor isn’t a nice place to live in, but Providence
made it, not the Federal Government; and half Aus-
tralia is just like Nullarbor. In fact, the line was
taken that way because it was a better place than
the average. If the men there receive less wages
than those in “closely-settled regions” it is probably
because men in closely-settled regions claim more on
the ground of exorbitant city rents. Anyhow, the
statement is too general; in some closely-settled
regions (in Tasmania, for instance) wages are cer-
tainly less than on the transcontinental. On the
Federal railways the workers already receive the
whole produce of their labor and a good deal more ;
in other words, working expenses exceed earnings,
the balance and the interest bill being paid out of
taxes. Even with a considerable increase in charges
they would still be getting the whole produce of
their labor. Certainly a living wage must be paid.
But one Labor Government after another has stuck
to the low-tariff and big-importation policy. In
other words, the worker has insisted that even his
cheap watch and his knife and fork, and his boot,
nails and his wife’s frock and his house-roof must
be imported and not made of common Australian
materials, the prices of which he can fix. The war
has made this policy very expensive, but it is the
workers’ own policy, and the workers must stand a
little of the loss, for there aren’t enough loafers to
pay the whole bill. Still there are plenty of legiti-
mate wage grievances, and if the transcontinental
railway men possess one of them it is a pity they
didn’t make their kick over that instead of over
the refusal of the authorities to be bushranged for
a free pass for an official with a foreign name—not
the garlic or macaroni or port-win e or Brazil-nut
sound, but the sausage sound.
“Tropical Druid” : Re “Lagoon’s” lament
concerning low prices for Solomon’s copra.
Landed in Sydney copra has brought during
the past four years £29 down to the present
price of £lB 10s., which, excepting the chaotic
depression of markets for several weeks after
the Big Fight opened up, is the lowest mark
reached since that time, and only the short-
age of bottoms that now exists is responsible
for it falling that low. If, as “Lagoon”
suggests, the Federal Government fixed prices
for copra in the Solomons, the same Gov-
ernment would probably be left to cart the
price-fixed produce to its market, and if this
were dependent on ships building or to be
built in Australia “Lagoon” might as well
file his schedule, for a trading and shipping
firm done out of its trading profits would
naturally endeavor to make it up on higher
freights, failing which a more profitable run
would be found for the steamers. As to
running a steamer every two or three months
Sydney-Solomons-America, and thus saving
expensive double handling and storage
charges at Sydney, it would be a good idea.
But, for planters and traders, a ’Frisco-
Islands service would be better still. Bar-

The Ballad Singer.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The real danger of democracy lies in its habit
of mistaking noise for action.”
I heard a ballad-singer in an age of Old
Desire,
Ere the Pyramids were fashioned or the
merchants thronged in Tyre.
Tall and blind upon the crossing, with a
merry heart and free,
Did he lift his voice and warble for the new
Democracy:
“IIo! The statesmen mouth and mumble and
the papers gabble on ;
But the kings are two-a-penny in the streets
of Babylon.
Gold hats! Old hats! Who’ll buy a crown?
Here’s a choice of gauds to fit any royal
frown.
Gold hats! Cold hats! One is splashed until
red,
Because the king who wore it last can’t find
his head!”
I heard a ballad-singer amid the roar of
trams
That ran from Tigris Junction to the new
Euphrates dams.
Lifting stony eyes to Heaven, he sang that
all might hear
The Millennium of Labor that was shortly to
appear:
“Ho! The statesmen fume and wrangle and
the papers say their say;
But we.’re eating dukes for dinner from
Mount Atlas to Cathay.
Gold chairs! Old chairs! Who’ll buy a
throne?
Each a work of splendid art well and widely
known !
Gold chairs! Cold chairs! Here are one or
two
JSGcely ventilated where the knives came
through!”
I heard a ballad-singer—did I wake or did I
dream?—
’Mid the paper trumpets blowing and the
motor-horns a-scream.
Blind as justice or as Homer, by the kerb he
took his stand,
Singing gaily to the nations with a red flag
in his hand:
“Ho! The statesmen mouth and wrangle and
the papers gabble on ;
But the kings are two-a-penny as they were
in Babylon.
Gold hats, old hats —some the worse for
wear —•
The ancient right to be a, slave is getting
past repair!
Old hats! Cold hats! Get them blocked
anew !
The withered tree is rooted up ichere such
fruit grew!”
And as he sang with all his might to bid the
world rejoice,
The slavish nations rose and crowned their
own blind voice.

:
the Islands requirements are of U.S.A. or
Japanese, thanks to Australia’s industry-
killing low tariff. I know a man who wanted
to charter from the Government an auxiliary
sailing craft of some 300 tons burthen and
run her between the Islands and San Fran-
cisco. After much legal quibbling as £o the
validity of the vessel (which was a German
prize, by the way), the application for char-
ter was turned down. Surely a suitable
charter party could have been drawn up
inside an hour and other arrangements made
in a reasonable time. But no. There lies
the ship to this day with four years of bar-
nacles on her bottom, running-gear rotting
away, and what was at the time of her cap-
ture a fine oil-engine now a mass of rusted
ironwork. Thwarted in this scheme, the same
man then offered his services to the Govern-
ment to run a 5000-ton cargo ship, already
taken over by the Commonwealth and lying
in an Australian port, with copra from the
Islands direct to England, lie showed how
ha could buy the copra on the spot at ruling
market price, load up locally and proceed to
England, returning via America if sufficient
loading did not offer in the Cold Country.
He would have made handsome profits for
the Commonwealth on both copra-buying and
freight, while supplying the munition-fac-
tories with the much-needed glycerine from
the copra, lie was again turned down, be-
ing told that the ship was needed for more
urgent work. The more urgent work turned
out to be copra shipped by Private Enter-
prise at Sydney and carried by P.E.’s
steamers from the Islands it was proposed
to load the tramp at!
The March on the Rhine.
The Allies are marching to the Rhine now!
A few days ago the last scowling Hun sol-
dier was hustled out of France. Next week
there should not be many of them left in Bel-
gium. But it will take a long time for the
aroma of Hun to evaporate in either locality.
The conditions of the armistice relative to
the surrender of battleships, cruisers and
submarines appear to be controlled partly
by delegates from the revolutionary German
crews. When the humiliation is complete the
Allies will have control of more floating
hardware than they are likely to have em-
ployment for, unless some of the vast col-
lection of warships can be used for transport-
ing soldiers and souvenirs. Meanwhile the
Kaiser and his tin-soldier heir have bolted
into Holland, the various other sauer-kraut
kings and gilt sundries are concealing them-
selves, and republican States have sprung
up like cabbages after the wet. Ilow Austria
is situated has not been mentioned lately,
but as there probably is going to be no more
Austria the omission is not of any import-
ance. For the present the most perplexing
question turns upon the problem of with
whom and with what the rest of the world
is going to make peace. Peace with honor
is at any rate sometimes an understandable
proceeding. Peace with chaos presents some
difficulty of comprehension. At the moment
the chaos of Europe east of where the war
was is staggering, and it is not pos-
sible to conceive of the disorder raging
until the tortured inhabitants get a system
of square feeds. For this reason the appeals
of the German for bread may deserve to be
listened to more attentively than might other-
wise be the case. In the circumstances of
the hour there is a close connection between
law and order and nourishment. The
rapacity with which the German raided the
Belgian and French pantry, and then, on the
day after the war collapsed, shouted for the
Allies to pass the menu, implies that in the
construction of modern Germany a psycho-
logical mistake was made in making sausage
secondary to kultur.
The Wheat Prospect —if there is a
Prospect.
The drought has been officially recognised in
several of the States. Like that British iron-
clad the sinking of which in 1914 is now
announced, its whereabouts was obvious some
time ago, and it has at last been put on a
proper footing. Expensive public function-
aries have mentioned it. Calculations and
estimates are coming out —for instance, the
probable N. S. Wales wheat crop is set down
at 15,000,000 bushels, as compared with
44,000,000 bushels last year and 67,000,000
in 1915-16. Agriculture is a wobblesome
affair in Australia. Thus its product bounced
up joyously to a total value of £74,000.000 in
1915-16, whereas the year before it had
bounced miserably down to £36,000.000. The
position may be summarised thus: —
(1) Wheat is by far the biggest crop and covers
twice as much ground as ail other agriculture put
together.
(2) It is grown on rather less than 20,000 square
miles of Australia, selected out of 2,974,581 square
miles, presumably for its superior qualities or its
accessibility.
(3) On this selected area a farmer may, in a
very good year like 1915-16, make as much as an
English farmer does in an average year provided he
works rather more than twice as hard— i.e., covers
rather more than twice as much ground. In a bad
year like 1914-15 he may make as much as the
English farmer’s average provided he works 13 times
as hard.
(4) If the wheat area was multiplied by two or
three or four it would either be necessary to open
new ports so as to extend the business into lands,
like the N. S. Wales South Coast and the Victorian
Western District, which are now crippled by isola-
tion, or else to carry the business into regions
where the wheat-grower would have to work 12
times as hard on a steady average as hij bucolic
contemporary in England.
In the way of manufactures, Australia, so
far as natural conditions go, is on nearly as
good a wicket as England. The wicket isn’t
quite so good, for coal and iron deposits are
very moderate, considering the size of the
country; and water power, except in the
favored North, is pitiably scarce, but it is
good enough. As regards wheat, the biggest
crop, the wicket is rotten. Australia smooths
over the difficulty in part by special devices.
The maintenance of the police, of schools, of
the bulk of the charities and a few other
things are charged to the general revenue,
which is propped up by loans, for if they
were charged to local rates, as in England,
the wheat-grower in most places would
simply burst up with taxes and cease grow-
ing the usual substance. Unpayable rail-
ways are supplied—in N. S. Wales alone,
out of 4679 miles of line 2SOO miles are on
the pauper list. It takes anything between
two and thirteen miles of line in Australia
to serve a wheat area which one mile will
serve in England. And there are no manu-
facturing towns on the lines, as in England,
to make business and support the heat and
burden of the wheat, for practically all the
factories of two-thirds of the population of
a country which slightly exceeds the United
States in size are crammed into two towns
in a corner. Hence the condition of the rail-
ways. Taking all things into account, the
land looks a very poor place to cram the re-
turned soldier on, especially in a drought
year. If he is sent farther out along the
comparatively narrow belts which can be
settled without rousing an irresistible de-
mand for the smashing of the Two Big Cities
Monopoly of trade and manufactures —to
places, for instance, like Ilillston (N.S.W.),
which has been cordially recommended—he
may strike regions where it will be necessary
to work five or six times as hard as the Eng-
lish farmer for the same gross return. If he
is. left there without a centre of civilisation
within 100 or 200 miles he will die of loneli-
ness or drop out of civilisation. If wheat
railways are built to his loneliness there will
be more unpayable or pauper lines for the
country to carry, and that kind of thing has
its limits. The repatriation people might
consider these points. More manufacturing
and less craze for shoving unoffending people
on the dust seems to be called for.
A Partial Remedy for Machine Politics.
The periodical cry against machine politics
is again on deck, and the periodical demand
for genuine Responsible Government is at
the wicket and batting strongly. Also both
of them are under full sail, and are quoted in
a rising market. In the circumstances it
might be suggested that censure motions as
we now have them should be abolished and
prohibited. It might not be much of a re-
form, but it would help. The present system
is to declare that the Government has lost the
confidence of the House, which it probably
couldn’t lose because it never possessed the
article. It was simply created in the usual
way, not because a majority had confidence
in it, but because it had rather less want of
confidence in it than in , any other probable
combination. The majority had faith in some
of the Ministers —a majority must have a
trace of faith in at least one Minister to
make a Ministry possible—and it put up with
some others as necessary evils. If the
present-day censure proposal is a success, then
the whole Cabinet goes and is replaced by a
similar Cabinet. A better way would be for
the motion to read that the House has no
confidence in a certain office-holder, and
wants to get rid of him separately, and then
if the vote is carried he must go separately.
If the mover of the resolution wanted to get
rid of two portfolio-holders or the entire lot,
they would be named individually in the
indictment and voted on individually. Then,
instead of the Minister who is almost indis-
pensable having to be sacrificed in order to
get rid of two or three disastrous clowns, he
would be endorsed by an overwhelming
majority and encouraged to take a higher
place, while the disastrous specimens went
into outer darkness. Under the existing
method, whereby Ministers are made by the
Premier for reasons not explained, or by
the secret caucus possibly after recrimina-
tion and a free fight, or by backstairs influ-
ence, the community has to put up with
many strange creatures for fear of worse.
At the same time capable men with an hon-
est ambition for power have to put up with
a lot of strange company. The rules of the
game don’t permit them to state how they
got into it or why they endure it. They have
simply to put up with the society they are m
or throw honest ambition overboard. There
is a great deal to be said for the direct elec-
tion of Ministers by a secret ballot of the
House as a step towards the breaking up of
machine politics, for then three-fourths of
the caucus might vote against the caucus
candidate and no one could prove that they
did it; but at least the public veto on Minis-
ters individually would go a long way. It
might not always secure the best men, but it
would throw out the worst ones. Many a
Postmaster-General might think twice before
reading his verses in public if he hadn’t
the popularity of the Treasurer to support
him and couldn’t drag down the Minister
for the Territories in his fall. Of course it
might be, while the system was new, that
the whole Ministry would threaten to resign
after the ancient precedent if its Postmaster-
General was taken from it. But then an
ardent supporter would naturally arise and
move for the rejection of each Minister indi-
vidually, and when the vote showed that the
great majority regarded the Treasurer as
almost god-like in his character, and viewed
the Minister for the Territories as more than
a brother, these gentlemen could hardly
desert their parts. The deafening call of
duty would restrain them.

“N.A.” : The Merchant Seamen’s League is
one of the bright spots of British trades-
unionism. Perhaps it is because the sea-
faring folk have met the gentle Hun in the
midst of his policy of frightfulness and suf-
fered to the extent of 15,000 non-combatant
sailors’ lives. When the British Seamen’s
Union decided to use the boycott against
Germany for years after the war there
was a howl of derision from the Labor party.
Consequently J. Havelock Wilson and
other officials hit upon a novel idea to test
the views of trade-union and Laborites fight-
ing with the British expeditionary forces.
Ballot papers were issued through certain
newspapers by which a referendum on the
proposed boycott and the need for a trade-
union party could be taken. “The future
interests of Labor,” said Wilson, in an
earnest appeal, “depend on the soli-
darity, commonsense and patriotism of the
trade-union movement. We desire to purge
the trade-unions of the anti-national, middle-
class adventurers and cranks who have pro-
vided 10 per cent, of the funds and wield 90
per cent, of the power through wire-pulling.”
It is a fitting coincidence that the Australian
Seamen’s Federation similarly stood high in
its patriotism during the war, despite the
stampede from work in the Big Strike orga-
nised by the I.W.W. element in defiance of
the orders of the Seamen’s Executive. At the
Easter State Labor Conference delegates
from the union opposed tooth and claw the
pro-Hun resolutions that were sent along to
Perth.
Though quite a swag of Hun kings and
princes have left for parts known or un-
known, it isn’t recorded, strangely enough,
that one of them fled in an airship. There
is nothing up-to-date about royalties.
Councillor Turtle Soup has received an
unexpected knock from one of his own
brethren. Herbert Smith, who has sat in
the Melbourne City Council for several years,
recently resigned from the Hawthorn Tram-
way Trust, in which he represented the
M.C.C. In penning his farewell Smith pro-
tested against the practice of “entertaining
members at dinner, after the Trust’s meet-
ings, out of the Trust’s funds and sometimes
with the accompaniment of expensive wines.”
Members of the 11.T.T., somewhat flustered
by the publication of Smith’s remarks,
pointed out that they are not paid for their
work, and that therefore helping themselves to
a free meal now and then is an “infinitesimal
matter.” It is an excuse very similar to that
put forward by members of the same Trust
when it was proposed, on the opening of the
Hawthorn line, that members should have
free passes. That was, of course, another
paltry matter not worth mentioning; yet lots
of people did mention it. A public-spirited
man has a lot to put up with.
“Bert It.”: London was the Mecca of all
Australians in England. At Wareham, the
L.S.W. express passed the camp every day
on its way thither, and longing eyes followed
it, while the gazers sighed for the leave which
never was granted. That most popular officer
“General Leave” never visited the, camp,
although rumors of him arriving for Christ-
mas (1917) raised hopes very high. When
all hope was settled by a routine order for-
bidding train travelling during the Christmas
holidays most of the troops determined to
take leave. The distance to London was 110
miles. Some men hired taxis, others bor-
rowed bicycles, a few started out to walk it,
but the majority “jumped the rattler.” The
local paper came out in special editions:
“Great Advance On London !” “All Objec-
tives Taken !” There were 8000 present on
a muster parade a week before the holidays,
but by Christmas Day the camp was
empty save for the staff. After Box-
ing Day the absconders dribbled back
in ones and twos, all very happy and
quite satisfied to take what was com-
ing to them. The C.O. worked overtime
for weeks, but the pile of crime-sheets never
appeared to be any less, and the crowd in
mass formation waited outside his office day
after day. All the clinks were crowded to
suffocation. The boys were put three in a
“peter,” but nobody objected. It was winter
time, and they were sent to bed just after
4 p.m. It was never long before someone
burst into song. “When You Come Home.
Dear,” was a great favorite, and everybody
joined in. Every day batches of prisoners
were sent out on fatigue under escort. A
party was unloading trucks at the rail-
way station when the express came in.
“What about a few days in London, boys? '
suggested one of the mob, and away the whole
crowd went, escort and all. “Aye, ehoom.
they’re a bad lot. those Australians,” the
“Tommy” Army Service N.C.O. in charge
confided to the motor-driver as they took back
the empty lorry.
“Chris”: Premier Peake, of South Aus-
tralia, has once more arrested attention by
his ingenious device for getting round the
living-wage difficulty. Some time ago Presi-
dent Jethro Brown, of the Industrial Court,
decreed that 10s. 6d. a day was a fair mini-
mum wage for the State. The Premier, when
pressed about the matter of a minimum for
the Government employees, in his usual
despairing fashion said that there were only
two ways, taxation and retrenchment. How-
ever, after chewing the matter over for a
couple of weeks, Peake made a further
announcement of policy. Now he had made
up his mind that the State was under a
moral obligation to see that its employees re-
ceived what was in fact a living wage. Brown
had decided that lOs.Gd. was a living wage for
a family which included three kiddies. But
from this it appeared that 10s. Gd. would be
more than a living wage for a single man.
Therefore Peake reckons that while it may
be his religious duty to increase the mini-
mum-wage for married men, there is no need
to grant the bachelor extra coin. At the
same time, Peake is not forgetful that Gov-
ernment workers enjoy enviable privileges,
and he proposed to make 10s. a day the mini-
mum-wage for married men only. He pro-
posed to do this by granting a war-bonus to
those of the married legion in Government
service who don’t already receive 10s. There
are one or two points about the arrangement
which need consideration. In the first place,
if the principle were extended to private
employment, married men would be in
danger of being worked out of their jobs.
And the Government lays itself open to the
suspicion that it is becoming a sort of matri-
monial propaganda bureau by its taxing of
the single man —who sometimes carries a
household on his back.

It is now “Pierrot Pie No. 8,” at the Play-
house (Sydney), where Sydney James and
co. have scored more than 100 performa •
The new bill contains one or two old tavoi-
ites, notably James’s excellent night-watch
man sketch. Jo Brennan does anothei \
lage-idiot turn and a gasman song in tne
Tom Dawson manner; the kennedys, Josie
Jackson, Kathleen Shearer and Madeline
Rossiter supply the concert music, and little
Cecil Haines twinkles in one or two turns.
There are some good laughs in “The Lies o
Truth,” which is a well-mounted and crowded
travesty of the Emelie Polini show ; but a
little more sparkle in the dialogue wouldn t
do it any harm. James, in a half-and-iiair
costume, doubles the parts of Gina and Sava-
loy, the impresario; Desmond is a patheti-
cally-bashed version of Gina at her school-
mistress stage; Georgie de Lara is Gina in
her dope-taking days, and Cecil Haines is
the same character at her dainty best.
To-morrow night at the Criterion (Syd-
ney) Frank Harvey, disguised as Robert
Stafford, will, for the last time hurriedly
arrive with Mrs. Stafford’s furs at the
dingy-looking flat to which Muriel Starr had
departed, and take her home to the affluent
mansion in which they quarrelled over
the matrimonial delicacies of “Bought and
Paid For.” On Saturday the leading lady
will appear in “Madame X,” a play of the
“powerful” type and one of her best parts.
D. W. Griffith, whose photo-plays place
him at the head of American screen directors,
has produced another memorable movie
drama in “Hearts of the World,” now show-
ing at the Royal (Sydney). In “Intoler-
ance” Griffith showed his cleverness with
spectacular scenes, but was over the heads of
the multitude with his complicated story.
“Hearts of the World” is a simple love story
of the war, handled in Griffiths’s most artis-
tie manner, and its simplicity helps, it to be
his greatest effort so far. The British and
French Governments gave the producer every
facility to make this drama contain thrilling
and realistic fighting, and allowed many of
the scenes to be taken in the battle-zones.
Allied Government’s officials are shown en-
gaged in war work, and the House of Com-
mons and the Chamber of Deputies are pic-
tured. The titles of the scenes showing
Britain’s ready help to France against the
Hun were worded to dispel the haze of igno-
rance that existed in parts of U.S. regarding
England’s part in the Great War. It was
only gradually that America realised the
tremendous scrap that the British Empire
was putting up in France. “Hearts of the
World” shows British and French soldiers
fighting with equal vim, and the success of
the film in U.S. shows that the Yanks
“Eyes of Youth,” at
Sydney Palace.
John Delacey as a
detective who gets
softening of the heart
have realised that
the two nations
are ‘some scrap-
pers.” The love
story shows a girl
(Dorothy Gish)
and a lad (Robert
Harron) in an old
village of northern
France preparing
for their wedding.
The declaration of
war shatters their
dreams, the youth
going to the
trenches and the
girl becoming a
refugee. Some
masterly touches
of humor are con-
trasted against the
pathos by the wan-
derer (Lillian
Gisli) and three
mu sketeers (a
French edition of
Bairnsfather’s Old
Bill, Bert and
Alf). The hopelessness of the civilian
population under shell fire, the dogged
retreat of the British and French, the arrival
of the Yanks and the re-union of the lovers
were vivid features.
Pershing’s Crusaders are sweeping mightily
across the Town Hall ( Sydney) screen this
week. Their mothers, sisters, wives, sweet-
hearts and brothers who had to stay at
home and work that the fighters might be fed
and clothed, are also depicted in all their
energy. The picture deals with everything on
a stupendous scale, and it is an effort to
realise the overwhelming force that Uncle Sam
has put into his effort for the freedom of the
world. The film shows the army’s meat, its
bread, the making of every detail of its out-
fit, the building of the nation’s ships, while
the letterpress bristles with figures which
leave behind those whose ready-reckoner
is their finger-tips. Finally all the
strings by which the army is guided are
gathered into the hands of General Pershing,
and when, on arrival in France, he hands
them over to the keeping of Foch to do with
as he thinks best, the climax of an intensely-
interesting film is reached. At the Lyceum
Mae Marsh leads her young man back to the
simple home life in a screen-story called “The
Beloved Traitor.” “The Kid is Clever” is a
loop-the-loop film thrill under the direction
of George Walsh at the Strand. Hoyt’s and
the Haymarket give a sumptuously uphol-
stered presentation of Gilbert Parker’s
“Judgment House.” The picture stands out
in the matter of character study. Violet
Ileming, as Jasmine the beautiful young
wife, is convincing and appealing, most of
all in the final Scene, when, as a Red Cross
nurse, she a trends the wounded during the
South African Wjar, and is in time for the
final curtain with"*hubby, who is fighting in
the British lines.
There is no warning of a change of Bill at
Her Majesty’s (Sydney). “Katinka” will
apparently be at the old stand for some time
to come.
At the Palace (Sydney) Emelie Polini
still samples three careers at every perform-
ance of “The Eyes of Youth.”
Barry Lupino and Billy Rego, as the in-
competent stage-hands, are still tangling
themselves up in the collapsible trestle at
the Tivoli (Sydney). The turn is one of the
gayest things in “Iloni Soit,” which revue
keeps on earning its greasepaint without
trouble.

ined by Marie Corelli. Wondergraph has
had a weird “Whispering Chorus,” in which
the progress of the hero to the chair of elec-
trocution was punctuated by the dull thud
of impressionable citizens in the audience
falling from their chairs in a faint. A thrill,
this—of a kind ! All the shows have been
hard lnt by the tramways strike. On the
other hand, the well-equipped suburban pic-
ture-halls have been having the time of their
lives.
Suddenly sensitive to the high cost of
bluffing, the Firm is refusing any longer to
maintain the fiction that “The High Cost of
Loving” is an uproarious success. Therefore
that dubious disturbance will be withdrawn
from the Royal (Melb.) on Saturday in
favor of an old friend, “Potash and Perl-
mutter.”

Compelled to postpone the production of
“Molly Bawn” until next Saturday night,
Allen Doone is filling in the present week at
the King’s (Melb.) with a revival of the
“Parish Priest.” This is the little play
which affords the Rev. Doone opportunities
for holy ministrations among a young and
artless * flock. Whiteheaded and venerable,
he wanders about, wiping away tears,
mending damaged lives, and bringing dis-
cordant lovers together again. No dis-
pute is too bitter to defeat his diplomacy
stiffened by his pious authority. All

mensely brightened
by distributing an Orangeman and two dog-
fights over the three acts.
“Hello, Everybody!” is still the noisy
greeting at Her Majesty’s (Melb.). How-
ever, the show is not all racket and alterca-
tion. There are one or two quiet spots when
Maud Aniery is dancing and Jack Can-
not is thinking of a fresh impertinence to
hurl at some unoffending stranger in the
stalls. But there is also a more solemn event
in which neither Maud nor John is inter-
ested. It is the great moment when a half-
dozen of Williamson’s divinities appear in
the rble of Yenus de Milo, and attempt to
make the original look like a clumsy imita-
tion. The attempt fails. There is a discrep-
ancy in some cases between the classic and
the modern model that would need a study in
advanced diplomacy to describe politely.
The Tivoli (Melb.) remains the address
of “Everybody’s Doing It.” That weak en-
tertainment is now nearly three weeks old,
and apparently continues to survive merely
through being too feeble to approach the
effort of dying. The best performers in the
show continue to be those who take least
liberties with the English language. Among
them this paper hastens to mention Leslie
Gaze, who has not lost the soothing diction
which he first revealed in “The Chocolate
Soldier.” Also Jean Keith warbles her little
bit with decorum, and Peggy Peat’s voice at
least has the virtue of having been bom far
away from Noo Yark.
Leila Doubleday gave another recital at
the Auditorium (Melb.) on Saturday. The
audience was small and rapt enough to give
the affair the effect of a private seance, and
it must be said that all Leila’s contributions
were conducive to sustained and solemn
awe. More for the matter of the music than
the manner of execution Nardini’s “Lar-
ghetto,” the “Praeludium and Allegro” of
Pugnani-Kreisler, and the three movements
of Lalo’s “Symphonie Espagnole” soaked
into many souls. Throughout, the artist’s
rather ungraceful bowing was musically
effective, but there was no witchery in the
straight, true tones which she drew from her
fiddle. She was at her best in the Pugnani-
Ivreisler item, but it seemed as if in the
Corelli Variations (Tartini-Ivreisler) the
flickering jewellery in the score had escaped
her notice. Miss Ivy Philips, the contralto,
helped to maintain the dignity of the meet-
ing. Also the beefy basso, George Gray-
stone. whose every note appears full of bov-
ril, boomed all he knew of “The Yeomen of
England.” Harold Elvins at the piano was
the usual accomplished chaperon.
“The Judgment House” is catching the
eye of Hoyt’s (Melb.) audiences this week.
Freely adapted from Gilbert Parker’s novel,
the film endeavors to present the _ Infernal
Triangle as something rather novel in human
error; but the only novelty in the yarn is
the almost religious manner in which the
offence is condoned. George Beban in “One
More American,” also at Hoyt’s, discloses
the striking problem of an irresistible Dago
immigrant versus an immovable Yankee
grafter. In another part of the programme
“The Green-eyed Monster” is let loose and
almost devours the happiness of the two
leads, Robert Mantell and Genevieve Ham-
per. At the Melba the week is being divided
between William S. Hart in “The Devil’s
Double” and Madge Evans in “Neighbors.’
At the Britannia “More Trouble” brought
Frank Keenan into view for three days on
Monday. To-day Belle Bennett is the flame
in “Ashes of Hope,” and there is no doubt
that Belle is a considerable conflagration.
Adelaide celebrated peace, Irish-fashion, by
a fight—the nearest approach to a riot it has
had for years. Thursday was a close holiday,
with the attraction of a big march of chil-
dren, women and returned soldiers, to the
Oval. The men of the Municipal Tramways
system, which serves the city and suburbs,
announced at the last moment that, with the
idea of doing honor to their fallen comrades,
they would not work that day. .Relying on
its good tramway service, Adelaide has no
railways at all in the eastern suburbs, or in
most of those north and south. The check to
traffic was direful. When some cars were
got out, manned by veterans or amateurs,
crowds stoned them (under the impression,
it is said, that the men had asked for leave
and had been refused it), and the attempt to
meet the emergency and to permit a great
section of the citizens to acclaim peace and
the men who had fought to bring it about
had to be given up. Military uniforms were
prominent in the riot; but the Returned
Soldiers’ Association warmly repudiates having
had anything to do with them. The uniforms,
it said, were those, probably, of men returned
for disciplinary reasons, or else of the type
of “miserable skunk who had evidently just
gone into camp with the idea of getting a
joy-ride on the water.” The Arbitration
Court was called together by deputy-president
Webb at the sporting hour of 5 a.m. on Fri-
day. The men were willing to work, but
demanded a pledge that nobody should be
prosecuted for any act of violence of the’
previous day. Then other irrelevant matters
came into the argument, and finally the Trust
discharged all its 700 men and advertised for
fresh hands. At time of writing (19/11/T8)
the service was idle.
The foundation of our democratic consti-
tution is that Parliament controls the
finances when it gets the chance, or rather
when it has the energy to get out of its old
rut and take the chance. Thus Acting Prime
Minister Watt, the strong man who some-
how didn’t eventuate, hopes to get the finan-
cial business through before the Christ-
mas and New Year adjournment, but isn’t
sure. By that time half the money will be
spent, and it will be too late to grumble
about the other half, for the Government will
be “already committed.” If the session com-
menced automatically on June 15, a fortnight
before the old financial year closed, and the
Government had to present its financial pro-
posals automatically in July, and members
should automatically wait for their pay till
the business was put through, the pebple might
have a voice in money matters, but at present
they have almost forgotten that money
matters in the least. At one time there were
Supplementary Estimates dealing with matters
that had arisen after the Budget was passed,
but now they are hardly required, for all the
Estimates are supplementary. The members
also look, so far as finance goes, like a mere
supplement, or a postscript, or an after-
thought, or no thought at all.
THE DAY I WON THE AVAR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I am a man of modest mind,
To sing my praises disinclined ;
But though myself I usually efface,
My modesty I hid it,
And my duty proudly did it
The day I won the war in Martin-place.
Of course 1 might have gone to fight:
For those who like it that’s all right;
I do not care for fighting, I’ll admit.
They’re risky, these advances —
I don’t like taking chances ;
But once in Martin-place I did my bit!
Though I was not in khaki seen,
I often feel that I have been
More patriotic than I have appeared.
When it’s things that really matter
Myself 1 rather flatter;
You should have heard the gallant way I
cheered!
Though I don’t like this silly fuss
Made over men who fought for us,
This victory appeals to every man.
I feel no doughty digger
Could have applied more vigor
In beating with a bottle on a can.
That day and night in Martin-place,
I feel I justified my race,
The way I waved my toy flag to and fro.
For order I’m a stickler,
But the way I used a “tickler” —
Well, men for less have won the D.S.O.
And though a fellow’s time it takes,
I yell for all the diggers’ sakes;
A peace each week I’d gladly celebrate.
And remember when 1 maffick,
Amid the trams and traffic,
They also serve who cheer and jubilate!

That table covers the history ‘of the Com-
monwealth Bank from the time of its estab-
lishment in 1912. It is an amazing record,
made possible, of course, only by the war.
But nobody would have dreamed in 1914
that the Commonwealth Bank would show a
profit for the past half-year £38,000 in ex-
cess of the disclosed profits of the century-
old Bank of N. S. Wales, with its seven
millions of shareholders’ funds. Before pro-
ceeding further, however, look at the growth
of the balance-sheet figures :

The bank has been working overtime on Com-
monwealth Government war business —float-
ing loans, attending to the financing of the
wheat, wool and butter pools, and other big
side-lines. All these Government war opera-
tions have helped to make profits for the
bank. And it has been doing some of this
work at wonderfully small cost to the Gov-
ernment. For instance, the £150,000,000
raised in the six local War Loans cost the
Commonwealth only 4s. Gd. per cent. —in-
cluding commission, printing, advertising and
the bank’s charge of 2s. for flotation and
management exes., which is to cover all work
done until the loans mature, and the princi-
pal is repaid. Compare this with the £2 7s. Id.
per cent, which it cost the States to raise
loans in London between 1910 and 1915 —a
charge which did not include management
exes, during the currency of the loans. The
difference between these two charges repre-
sents a saving of over 3i millions on the
£150,000,000 raised through the bank.
Clearly the bulk of the profits shown are
from war-time earnings. When conditions
become normal again and the Government
abandons its various pooling schemes, the
balance-sheet figures will shrink and some
present sources of profit will dry up.
The effect of the four war years has been
that Governor Denison Miller has been able
to show visible reserves of £1,076,026. This
amount is equally divided between a general
reserve fund, used to protect the business,
and a redemption fund, which the Act
established for the purpose of repaying any
Treasury advances made to the bank or re-
deeming debentures or stock issued. But if
this redemption fund exceeds the amount of
debentures or stock in circulation the excess
“may be used for the purposes of the redemp-
tion of any Commonwealth debts or State
debts taken over by the Commonwealth.”
Though the Act provided a million to estab-
lish the concern, £lO,OOO was all that was
required to open branches of the bank in
every State capital, at Canberra, Townsville
and London in 1912. This advance was re-
paid in a few months. Now there are 3G
branches and 2756 savings bank agencies.
When the Fisher Labor Ministry intro-
duced its Bill, Private Enterprise regarded
the establishment of a State bank with
considerable misgivings. It was thought
not unlikely that somebody would, get hurt
when the State concern got into its stride.
The Act, however, placed the Commonwealth
Bank out of reach of political control, and
Governor Denison Miller has an absolutely
free hand. Except that a lot of business has
been captured by the State bank, the private
banks have not been affected to any extent.
Though it does not subscribe to agreements
made by the Associated Banks, so far it has
not undercut exchange rates or lifted interest
rates on deposits. There is still a feeling
in some quarters that it may later on
attempt to do something more than act
merely as a steadying influence on the big
private banks. On this point, Denison Miller
made an important pronouncement in London
a few weeks ago. “The other banks,” he said,
“recognise now that the Commonwealth Bank
has come to stay, and that it will and
always does assist them when necessity
arises ; and it can be looked to with confi-
dence, and not fear.”

In Victoria, as in Queensland, workmen’s
compensation insurance is compulsory, but
whereas the State Office in the North has an
absolute monopoly the Victorian State Office
is in competition with all the other accident
offices. But since it has no capital on which it
has to pay interest, the State Office exercises
a big influence on the rates charged by the
private cos. The whole of its profits are
available for (1) reserves to strengthen the
Office’s position; and (2) the whole of the
balance is earmarked for bonuses to policy-
holders. Its mission, therefore, is to reduce
the cost of insurance to absolute bedrock.
Last year the first distribution of profits was
made, and £7506 was handed out on the basis
of the claims experience of each class of
business. But this is not the only benefit
received by the Victorian employer. Com-
missioner W. 11. Holmes explains:—
In addition to the cash bonus, employers have also
gained the advantage of special discounts provided for
in certain regulations gazetted under the Workers’
Compensation Act. Where both factors (special dis-
counts and cash bonus) have operated, employers
recognise that much better returns can be obtained
from this office than from other insurers. Em-
ployers who have not entrusted their business to this
Office have yet shared to some extent in the benefits
of its bonus distribution, inasmuch as other in-
surers, to retain their business, offered a discount of
25 per cent, of last year’s premium off the next
renewal premium. Such insurers subsequently
realising that there was yet a balance in favor of
this Office, decided to reduce their rates below those
quoted by the Department.
This month the Commissioner is inquiring
into the possibility of further reducing rates
in industries where the claims experience has
shown that the rates can be safely cut. The
Commissioner states that “the fact that the
reserve fund is now reaching a substantial
amount will have a material influence on the
revision of rates.” The general reserves
together with the reserves for unexpired
risks exceed the losses of the past three
years. The Bulletin hopes the rates
will not be cut to such an extent that sur-
pluses cannot be shown in years less favor-
able than recently. It makes practically no
difference to the policy-holder whether he
pays a smaller premium now or receives a
bonus later on. It is better for the State Office
to work on the bonqs basis than to find that,
owing to unfavorable claims experience, it
has to raise its rates again. Another point
to be considered is that though the present
reserves are certainly strong, should the
Office materially increase its business the
protection against contingencies becomes
proportionately weaker; and if rates were
cut to almost the limit of safety there is less
opportunity of building up reserves, unless
very favorable years are experienced. The
Office has not big interest earnings that it can
depend upon to build up reserves —interest
on funds at the Treasury for the past year
amounted to £774. No doubt Commissioner
W. H. Holmes is not overlooking that point,
and is making allowance accordingly when
revising the rates. Still, the bonus method is
undoubtedly the safer. One anticipates, the
other is based on actual experience.
The one weakness of this State Office, from
a co-operative point of view, is that it has to
employ the service of agents in the same way
as the private cos. Commission and agents’
expenses absorbed 4.1 p.c. of the net pre-
miums, and all other exes. 15 p.c. In Queens-
land all exes, absorb only 11.45 p.c., and it
is anticipated that that ratio will be reduced
when the Commissioner secures power to
inflict fines’ on employers who give the Office
trouble to collect their returns and pre-
miums. However, in the matter of cheapen-
ing the cost of workmen’s compensation in-
surance the Yic. State Office has certainly
done much. It was obviously a fair thing
that, having made insurance compulsory, the
State should provide the means of making
the burden as light as possible.

Under the arrangement the Colonial prefs.
receive one fully-paid £lO share for each of
their present £9 15s. shares, and the holder of
every 20 £1 15s. ords. is handed seven new
National shares (£8 each paid to £5). To
adjust existing relative interests, the National
prefs. were recently handed a bonus of £1
per share. The amalgamated bank thus
starts with its paid-up capital as follows:
61,762 prefs. fully paid to £lO .. £617,620
265,536 ords. of £8 paid to £5 .. 1,327,680
£1,945,300
This total is to be increased to £2,000,000 by
the issue at par of a further 238 £lO prefs.
and 10,464 ords.
The accounts of both banks for the half-
year to September 30 were recently pub-
lished, but it is not of much use printing the
usual comparative tables. It might be men-
tioned, however, that the Colonial’s disclosed
profit (£30,491) was a record. The usual
7 p.c. was paid on both prefs. and ords., and
£2OOO was cut up among the three directors
who have lost their jobs on account of the
amalgamation. Reserves and P. and L.
balance amounted to £321,578. The National’s
disclosed profit (£85,095) has been exceeded
on only one previous occasion. Reserves and
P. and L. balance, after paying 7 p.c. divs.,
and also allowing for the £1 per share bonus
to the prefs., was £719,775. Thus the visible
reserves of the new National will be
£1,041,353. Very little has been said about
internal reserves, but there is every reason
to believe that they are substantial.
Combining the balance-sheet figures as at
September 30 gives this: —
National. Colonial. Combined.

The position of the amalgamated bank is
very strong. Total liabilities to the public
amount to £18,998,873; and no less than
54.7 p.c. of that amount is held liquid. To
meet the £8,597,047 of liabilities not covered
by liquid assets there are the £15,032,906 of
advances and the £565,785 of premises.
No depositor could wish for better security
than that. The position is equally comfort-
ing from another point of view: Present capi-
tal and reserves combined amount to
£2,986,653. ; So for every £1 of the share-
holders’ funds there is £6 6s. lOd. of the
public’s money. In Australia anything up to
£8 is regarded as a safe working basis. The
new National is thus well placed to meet the
future. Having come out of the war on the
winning side the position of the Common-
wealth is considerably clearer than it
was only a few months ago. But we
have not seriously begun to pay for
our share in the war yet—our ■ fight-
ing has been practically all done with an
lOU. There are stupendous financial pro-
blems ahead, and, as chairman John Grice
remarked at the annual meeting of National
shareholders a few days before the armistice
was signed, “the outlook is not at all clear,
and the Board feels that in the conduct of
the bank’s business the directors must pursue
a careful, moderate course.”

This co., which runs a first-class Sydney resi-
dential hotel, got into the business at an
unfavorable time. To begin with, its pre-
mises cost more to erect than was antici-
pated. The war practically killed the
overseas tourist traffic; then six o’clock
closing followed; and all the time the
cost of provisions, liquors, etc., have been
steadily increasing, while the wages-siieet has
been affected by several awards. But in
spite of ail these troubles the profit made
during the past 12 months has enabled the
directors to pay off the arrears of dividends
on the pref. shares and also hand out a very
satisfactory first dividend of 10 p.c. to the
ordinaries. This indicates that not only is
Usher's Metropolitan being well patronised,
but also that the hotel is capably managed.
A. ,T. Usher for many years ran the old
Metropolitan, an unpretentious hotel which
used to occupy the site on which the
Daily Telegraph building now stands.
When the old premises had to go, this co.
acquired the goodwill and nailed up the old,
familiar sign a few doors down the street
while it erected and equipped modern pre-
lt started with an authorised capital
of £85,000, but that proved insufficient to
finance the undertaking. Paid capital is now
made up of 77,740 £1 ords. and 7000 £1
8 p.c. prefs. At August 31 there was also a
debenture debt of £00,538. Other liabilities
amounted to £4052. The property now
stands at £113,102, £10,300 is in furniture,
etc.; while liquid assets amount to £10,028.
Since the accounts closed, £2500 has been
paid off the debenture debt. In view of the
fact that the new premises have been occu-
pied only three years, and also taking into
consideration the difficulties which the
management has had to overcome, the co. has
done very well. The gross profit from trad-
ing for 1910 was £10,151, and expenses
£10,040; last year the gross profit had in-
creased to £29,508, witii an additional ex-
penditure (including provision for taxation)
of only £2870. The hotel having acquired a
reputation for efficient service, the directors
are now looking with some confidence to the
future. It is a difficult business, however,
and everything depends upon good manage-
ment.

Malay Queen Rubber Plantation, Ltd.
—This Melbourne co.’s estate of 493 acres is
at Membang (P.M.S.). It is now in its
eighth year, and though tapping was com-
menced three years ago and at least 413
acres are now in bearing, results have been
disappointing. Just about the time the co.
was formed there was a boom in rubber, and
as much as 10s. per lb. was being paid by
the market. The boom didn’t last long, how-
ever. This gives part of the Malay Queen’s
history since production began:—
Year to
June, Output. Sold. Average price.
1910 .. 17,3101 b. 15,8391 b. 2s. 6.75 d. per lb.
1917 . . 46,7771 b. 40,2031 b. 2s. 3.5 d.
1918 . . 84,0541 b. 74,6901 b. Is. 7.94 d. „
But while the price realised has been de-
creasing exes, have climbed, and as the all-
in cost (including depreciation and half of
the Melbourne- exes.) for the past year
worked out at Is. 8.5 d. per lb. of rubber
output there was a loss of £1722 on the 12
months’ operations. But even taking into
account the increase in expenses due to war
difficulties, costs at Is. per lb. were very
high, and were 3jd. per lb. more than ip the
previous year. However, the directors are
trying what a change in management can
do. With rubber at present prices, the posi-
tion just now is not cheerful, expenses
exceeding revenue by something like £350 per
month. And since the cash-box has been
drained the directors have had to look round
for means to finance the show. Capital at
June 30 was £21,787, made up of 15,000 £1
ords. and 7750 very expensive 25 p.c. £1
cum. prefs., of which £962 had not been
called up. Liabilities amounted to £1787.
Liquid assets, totalled £763, £21,483 had been
spent on development, £lOlO on buildings
and plant, £248 represented preliminary ex-
penses, and £7O was in odds and ends. To
make matters more difficult the co. has to
find about £4OOO to carry out various capital
works. So the F.M.S. Government is being
approached for a loan of £7OOO, to be repaid
in instalments. The directors consider this
“will obviate the necessity of increasing the
subscribed capital.” However, they seek per-
mission to increase the nominal capital suffi-
ciently to meet all liabilities. With the pro-
posed additional outlay experts declare that
the co. will own a first-class estate. So, pro-
vided everything goes well there, the future
depends entirely on the rubber market. As
to that the directors “are in accord with the
universal opinion expressed by the rqbber
press, and at meetings of the large rubber
cos. in England, that after the war the de-
mand for rubber will be great, and that a
steady rise may be expected.” Anyhow, even
were the market to show an early recovery,
the ordinaries are not likely to get a bite for
a while. The 25 p.c. pref. capital three years
ago consisted of 4842 shares paid to 9s.
There were at June 30 7750 of these shares
apparently paid up to £6788. To meet the
div. for the current year alone on these
shares the co. would have to make a net pro-
fit equal to about sd. per lb. on the 85.0001 b.
estimated output to June 30 next. But if
prices do rise to any extent, and the rise is
maintained, with reasonable luck there should
be good profits ahead.

When Alurninoferric is used in connection with
reservoirs its application is extremely simple. The
cakes or slabs (which measure 22in. x 7-in. x 6in. and
weigh about 561 b. each) are placed on edge in a per-
forated wooden box, or other suitable cage, at the
inflow to the reservoir, and as the slabs dissolve
readily the rate of Alurninoferric applied is in-
creased or diminished in proportion to the rise or
fall of the water passing, and may be readily regu-
lated to a nicety. One pound will clarify up to
3000 gallons of most turbid waters. Particulars from

Kalgoorlie Electric Tramways, Ltd.,, whose
head office is in London, showed a total rev-
enue of £32,070 last year and a profit of
£3O2S. Depreciation, however, cut deeply into
this surplus. Traffic receipts improved slightly,
but this increase was more than absorbed by
higher wages and dearer supplies. The
sanction of the local authorities was recently
obtained for an increase in some of the fares,
and additional receipts from this source are
expected to more than balance any extra
expenditure in wages and material this year.
The co. has further reduced its debenture
indebtedness by £OBO, and the amount now
outstanding is £46,320. Shareholders re-
ceived their last dividend (4 p.c.) ten years

bably be a long time before they get another.

Details of the operations of Teddy Miles’s
Bagnon Valley show at Renong (Siam) for
the year to May 31 have just drifted in.
During the first four months of the term the
dredge was in shallow ground, full of heavy
boulders, and when it did ge£ into easier
stuff again low values were met. The re-
sults for the past two years haye worked out
this way:—
Treated Tin Oxide, Recovered lb.
cub. yds. tons. per cub. yd.
1917 .. 1,020,654 454 i 0.992
1918 . . 820,739 235 0.641
The net proceeds, after paying royalty and
smelting charges, amounted to £32,876, com-
pared with £47,308 for 1917. Though the
average profit per ton was almost £l4O com-
pared with £lO4 for the previous year, the
profit per cub. yard was only 9.61 d. against
the previous 11.059 d. Mining costs were
very heavy—3.BBd. per cub. yard compared
with 2.248 d. for 1917. Shareholders
received 4s. per share—ls. less than in the
previous term—which absorbed £20,000. With
the 2s. since handed out the total distribu-
tion to date amounts to £55,000 on the paid-
up capital of £88,250. For the first four
months of the current year the dredge did
much better—l 49 tons coming from 313,000
cub. yards, giving an average of over 11b.
per cubic yard. The area of profitable
ground, however, is rapidly decreasing, and
the co. has acquired an interest in 400 acres
at Taipeng (F.M.S.), adjoining the Asam
Ivumbang. Of this area 150 acres have been
proved by the bore to be slightly over lib.
ground. Capital is to be £87,500, £46,666 of
which is to be allotted in shares to the Bag-
non Valley Co. for its dredge, and £40,833
(in shares) going to the vendors. Both
parties are to put up £8750 each as working-
capital. The co.’s cash balance at the end
of September was £17,500, so the directors
anticipated there would be no difficulty in
paying the usual quarterly Is. divs. and pro-
viding the £8750 for the new co.
The platinum getters at Fifield (N.S.W.) are
still waiting for rain. There is a lot of dirt
ready for treatment. Since The Bulletin
pointed out the disability under which the
getters labored in marketing their product
the price has been raised to £l3 per ounce
for crude platinum. Maybe this is because
none can be produced at present on account
of the drought. Meanwhile, however, it has
been proved that crude platinum can be re-
fined in Australia, and this is being done
on a commercial scale now. The Federal
Government, to be consistent, should step
in and prevent the exportation of the
crude platinum, as it does with lead and
copper. It will also have to see that the
platinum which is refined here is sold openly
to approved users, who consume the metal,
and not diverted to the English monopolistic
refiners. Said English refiners have a mer-
cenary interest in saying the Australian
refining is no good. The trade here can tell
a different story.

Mammoth Molybdenite, near Bathurst
(N.S.W.), slumped badly in Sydney last
week because mill returns continue rather
poor. For the month ended November 5
780 tons were crushed for a return of 55551 b.
molybdenite, equal to a shade over 71b. per
ton of crushing stuff. Having driven the
No. 1 tunnel north to the boundary the co.
is continuing with No. 2 drive, in the same
direction. The latter has gone 160 ft., and
will strike the boundary at another 100 ft.
The intervening 90ft. between the two
tunnels has been cut through, and an inter-
mediate drive has been started. Thus the
area embraced by the two main workings, the
boundary on the north and the tram-line
running to the plant on the south, has been
sliced up into four apartments. West of
Xo. 2 tunnel proceedings are also brisk,
contracts having been let for tbe driving of
two tunnels making west at right angles to
the main opening. These will run parallel,
and will in turn be connected by another
right-angle drive. The system will be con-
tinued indefinitely on the pillar-and-stall
principle, columns of the ore being allowed
to stand in place of any timbering. Mean-
time the B.H.’s Prop., which has an option
over 127 acres of the Mammoth’s leases on
the eastern side of the big deposit, is extend-
ing business by tunnelling in addition to
drilling. The test is being made as thorough
as possible.

The C.S.A., of Cobar (N.S.W.), reckons
on getting down to actual business with its
electrolytic works at Kandos, on the Mudgee
line, early next year. The shed, 200 ft. long,
covering the six reverberatories that will
treat the 100 tons of. 40 p.c. matte brought
from the co.’s refinery at Cobar, is being
completed. The tank shed, where 180 vats
will be in position when the job is finished,
has already been handled, the building
material being the cement blocks turned out on
the spot by the N. S. Wales Cement, Lime
and Coal Co., Ltd., which at present sends
coal and limestone for flux to Cobar. The
same show will provide the electric-power for
the C.S.A. at Kandos. The main railway
line runs at the side of the works, and this
will help to reduce the carting costs of the
matte from Cobar via Mudgee.

Vegetable Creek (N.S.W.) continues its
gay run while the tin boom lasts. Its divi-
dends for the- current quarter will amount
to 3s. per share, which takes £20,250. The
market has been sustained by steady returns
and big dividends, despite a great deal of un-
certainty as to reserves. Last April reserves
of tin oxide figured at 270 tons, but this
deep lead has shown itself capable of pro-
ducing 204 tons of oxide in 12 months with-
out diminishing reserves; so the quantity of
tin blocked out and ready for extraction
does not give a definite idea of the life of the
property.

An expert representing Brunner, Mond
and Co. has been spying out the land so that
a start may be given to the making of alkalis
in the Commonwealth. He appears to be
under the wing of Felton Grimwade and Co.
(Melb.), as he is being personally conducted
by one of the Grimwades. What the expert
wants is cheap electricity, limestone and
salt. Of the latter commodity there are
heaps in the Mallee lakes; but the other
essentials are too distant. State Geologist
Herman seems to have convinced the expert
that all he wants is to be got at Welshpool,
Southern Gippsland, where within four miles
of deep water is an easily accessible coal
formation. This will give cheap fuel, the salt
will be got out of the ocean electrolytically, and
the limestone is at hand. If Herman wins
out he will have got big chemists to engage
in an industry which will take a cool mil-
lion to start in a quiet but lovely part of the
Cabbage Garden. Yet there are those who
howl for shutting up the Mines Department!

The Maori Queen dredges have been
playing about in the Ovens River at
Bright (Vic.) for the best part of 15 years.
John McWhae and Langford had a good
deal to do with the show in the early days,
when shares were boosted by a feverish pub-
lic to £5O, only to come a subsequent smash.
Dividends have _ not been paid for many a
day, but there is a chance of them coming
along again owing to a spare block of ground
having been picked up as a bargain. This is
panning out about 370 z. a week for one
dredge. When No. 2 gets on the job also it
will be seen whether the dawn will be as
golden-tinted as Tom Husband deserves. No.
1 plant last year made money out of
wash in bad ground, so everything looks
promising for the current year y/ith the two
sets of buckets digging up the paddocks.

With a production of something like three-
quarters of a million sterling to its credit,
the Fenian, Meekatharra (W.A.), now seems
to be showing signs of decline. The grade
has lately fallen off, and the bottom levels
look less promising. Unfortunately there
doesn’t appear to be anything handy" to take
its place, unless it be the privately owned
Gwalia. This show has been crushing well
lately, but its value at depth has yet to be
proved. Nevertheless it has opened up satis-
factorily down to 150 ft., and the last yield
obtained from ore principally drawn from
near the surface was IOOOoz. from 418
tons. Another property, the Ingliston Con-
sols, owned by a local syndicate, has produced
several hundreds of thousands of pounds to
date. The ground is easy to work, and there
is abundance of free milling ore. But the
husre stopes are still stabbed with hand-drills
and the values estimated by tin-dish pro-
spects. But so long as dividends come along
without interruption,, shareholders don’t seem
to mind how much it costs to produce the
gold. Scarcity of efficient labor and war
conditions have played havoc with mining
on this field. In some mines exploration
work lias ceased, and in others operations
are at a standstill. Some shows have shut
down altogether.
Edna May Battler (W.A.) is very hopeful
that its option at Southern Cross will turn
out well. So certain of success are the direc-
tors that portion of the plant on the co.’s dis-
appointment at Westonia is being removed
and re-erected on the new show. But nothing
of any importance has so far been produced
which Avould justify the public in taking
anything more than an onlooker’s interest in
the proceedings.

Last year 21 persons were killed and 840
injured in and about the Westralian mines.
Ten of the departed were either crushed or
smothered by falls of ground, two lost their
lives in shafts, a like number on the surface,
four died from various injuries received
underground, while the remaining three got
entangled in machinery. Nearly two-thirds
of those who escaped with their lives were
injured underground.

Westralia now values its mining machin-
ery at £3,195,852, of which £2,875,251 is gold
extracting. Kalgoorlie heads the list with
£1.376,294 worth, Murchison next with
£364,257, and Mt. Margaret close behind
with £301,445.
“Two-up” : Two big gaps are noticeable in
the annual report of the Mt. Lyell co. The
first is the absence of plans of the mine. As
the Board owns up to making the best part
of a quarter of a million out of copper and
manures, it certainly could afford to let
shareholders know how things are going.
The second is that Sticht’s report is
omitted altogether. That is if he has writ-
ten anything since he returned from the
U.S.A.; and it is not at all likely that ho
has been idle since his return. So far as
the mining position goes the scraps served
up in the directors’ report contain very
little meat. It is pretty to say that
“exploration by diamond drill has estab-
lished the downward continuation of the
South Lyell ore body,” but whereabouts is
the ore, and what is the grade? Vocal
bouquets are thrown at the shareholders over
what has been done in the 12 months in
the 'North Lyell mine, but the flowers are
poor things. Thus “a good body of ore”
sums up the north drive ore body at 700 ft..
stope 40 is “opening up well” at 850 ft., while
“satisfactory results” express work done with
the drill at 925 ft. This sort of thing served
the practical miner of the pre-historic days,
but it is not the sort of dish to set before
the investor of to-day. It is handsome to
say that ore has been got 510 ft. from the
south boundary of the Comstock, but with-
out a plan to set out the size of the bodies
the news may mean a lot or a little —it
depends on how much inside knowledge the
reader has. What a nasty kick is given
Lyell Blocks by the assertion that “the dis-
closures of the northerly drives and bore-
holes point to a southerly underlay of the ore
bodies in this locality.” Why underlay? If
the sentence means anything it is that the
bulge of hematite at this point is making
into the North Lyell and carrying the ore
away from Alec Campbell’s little show.

The Mac tin-wolfram show, Story’s
Creek (Tas.), is doing rather well under
manager Miller’s guidance. Operations,
however, are restricted owing to the scarcity
of efficient labor and the prohibitive cost of
machinery to further equip the mine. But
with hand-labor mining and running the
mill 10 hours a day the show is producing
wolfram alone equal to over three-
quarters of the total Queensland out-
put, basing the comparison on the
September quarter. Mining costs are
naturally high, but with milling 2s. 3d.,
separating ss. per cwt. concentrates, total
costs work out at 245. 2d. per ton. The
actual tonnage mined per man during the
past two years, and since a 44-hour week
and an increase of Is. 6d. per day were
awarded, has decreased 25 p.c.

The shortage of shipping has set a number
of Tasmanians searching the island for a
decent steaming and gas-making coal, but, so
far, there are no reliable indications that the
quest is likely to prove any more successful
than in the past. There is a fair local supply
of household coal, and a good deal of the
Mount Nicholas and Cornwall product is
used on the railways; but the coal for gas
and other industrial purposes is mostly im-
ported from N. S. Wales. The revival has
led to the reopening of the old Colebrook
show, on the railway 30 miles or so from
Hobart. This coal-hole was worked some 30
years ago by the Baynton family; but the
Bayntons were farmers, and coal was only
a side-line with them. For a quarter of a
century now the mine has slumbered by the
siding. Recently a little co., the Tasma Coal
Co., has started the old show moving once
more, and is trucking coal to Hobart. It has
been discovered that the seams carry signs
of petroleum, and the new co. has just sold
an option to an oil-seeking crowd intent on
boring for something more inflammable than
coal. .

“J.R.K.” : One of the most promising small
tin shows that have been opened up for some
time in North Queensland is Busbridge’s, in
the old Silver Valley district. It is from
four to five feet wide and 18ft. long, and
bulks 9 p.c. With their heads just above the
grass roots, the party has taken out eight
tons of concentrates in almost as many
weeks. Busbridge is a serious aud patient
prospector, and this is another result ol
diligent and systematic work.
In four war years Queensland has pro-
duced 1075 tons molybdenite, which realised
£247,800. The best year was 1915, with an
output of 344 tons, worth £71,063. The
latest quarterly return was worth £12,421.

M. M. Henderson, till lately Chief Mechan-

ihas resigned to join the Perry Engineering
Co. at Gawler (S.A.). The Perry works

The little Jew, Ballin, who committed
isuicide when he heard the armistice terms to
(Germany, was the son of a Hamburg emigra-
tion agent. He served a commercial appren-
ticeship in England, and when he returned
THE PROBLEM SOLVED.
SHE : “I suppose everyone will have to work
hard now to pay for the tear.”
HE: “Well, thank goodness, they’re giving
preference to returned soldiers.”
to Germany he was employed by the Carr
Steamship line to conduct the flow of emi-
grants from Galicia, Poland and Hungary to
U.S. Soon he was made manager of the -whole
emigrant service of the firm. When the Carr
line was bought by the Hamburg-American
Ballin transferred to the latter house. At that
time the Hamburg-American co.’s capital was
£750,000. Under Ballin’s guidance it advanced
to £7.500,000. Annual profits advanced from
£125,000 to £2.800,000. In 1886 the flag flew
over 26 ocean steamers; in 1914 the fleet
numbered 180, of a tonnage of 1,500,000.
Arthur llindmarsh, a victim to influenza
at Wellington (M.L.) the other day, was
a grandson of that Rear-Admiral John
Hind marsh who was first Governor of
S. Australia. He was a solicitor in a small
way, a member of the M.L. House of Reps.,
and a strenuous battler in the cause of Labor.
Arthur was an amiable, fussy man, always in
a tremendous hurry about something. ' He
walked in a hurry. He talked in a hurry.
When he addressed himself to his brother
citizens or Mr. Speaker it was in language
so hurriedly delivered that the last word col-
lided heavily with the stern of the one ahead.
He was a sort of verbal eruption. He just
bubbled with earnestness, and though he had
his humorous aspects he was a citizen with
the finest ideals and the best of human im-
pulses. After struggling to get there for
nearly 20 years he reached the Legislature
four years ago and became leader of the
Labor party of which a majority was absent
when a couple could not be found.
“T. 0.1.”: Francis Foy, who died suddenly
last week on the Melbourne-to-Sydney ex-
press train, aged 64 years, was son of Mark
Foy, the founder of the firm of that name in
Sydney. He was born at 75 George-street,
Kingstown, a suburb of Dublin, where the
father carried on a drapery business. The
latter arrived at Melbourne in 1858, and he
carried on business at Castlemaine and
Sandhurst. In 1869 he went to Spring
Creek, a goldfield that he was instrumental
in having named Graytown, after Wilson
Gray, a notable democratic politician of
those days, who subsequently became a Judge
in Maoriland. Wilson Gray and Mark Foy’s
father were chums in Ireland. In 1870 Mark
Foy decided to establish himself in Mel-
bourne, and the business rapidly prospered.
On the death of the father the sons took up
the profit-making concern. The name of the
firm first appeared in Sydney in 1885.
Brigade-Major 11. F. Watson, who got
himself “mentioned” again lately, is a son of
the late ex-N. S. Wales Treasurer James
Watson. He left Australia with the Light
Horse in 1914, and was at Gallipoli. At the
hour word came to down tomahawks he had
the D. 5.0., the M.C. and four “mentions.”
He hung up his barrister’s horsehair to go
on the land in Queensland before the war.
References to the
late John Forrest

overland travelling
from the West Coast
to South Aus. Grif-
fiths in 1892 tramped
across from Tarcoola
to the then newly-dis-
covered Bayley’s Find
(afterwards Coolgar-
die) and went via
E u c 1 a, Esperance
(where is now Ravens-
thorpe) and Albany.
On arrival at what
was then Esperance
he wanted to strike
north to the new find
but was prevented by
the local police. Tak-
ing train to York from
Albany Griffiths
swagged it to Cool-
gardie, and arrived
shortly after the dis-
covery. Though well
over 50 when war
broke out Griffiths
considered himself
quite good enough to
mix it with the Hun
and enlisted, but on
arriving in England
he was promptly
shipped back to Aus-
tralia. He is now in
the Naval Guard, Fre-
mantle, and asserts
that he is quite willing
to tackle another swag
tramp so long as there
is the chance of the
color of gold at the end
of it.
Another Maorilander killed by ’flu’ last
week was Andrew Rutherford, one of three
gigantic brothers who were among the best
known of the old-time Amuri Wool Kings.
Andrew’s flocks were accustomed to browse
on Mendip Hills, and they made a very rich
man of him. But his fame was mainly poli-
tical. When Richard Seddon got fairly into
his stride Andrew sensed that the time was
ripe for the big landowners to become
Liberals, and to the joy of a scoffing popu-
lace he, was returned as one of the Seddonian
band of ‘‘land reformers” by the electors of
Hurunui, and held the seat for about nine
years. Andrew Rutherford was the first of
the affluent monopolists in Maoriland to
recognise that the Liberal policy of the Sed-
don-Ward regime deserved their earnest en-
couragement. The old man was 76 at the
end. Born in N. S. Wales, he. was taken as
a boy to Maoriland by his father, who settled
at Leslie Hills, on the Waiau, and prospered
greatly.
EMPIRE BUILDERS.
FIRST MAKER OF PEACE TEWMS : “Any'ow,

After nearly 54 years or service, F. IT.
Bruford, Victoria’s Auditor-General, has
decided to retire. He was born in January,
1846. In a niggardly spirit the Irvine
Government forced him to contract himself
out of portion of his pension rights when it
raised him from the position of Deputy-Com-
missioner of Taxes in 1903 to the post of
Auditor-General. The effect is that instead
of being able to claim two-thirds of his pre-
sent salary (£IOOO. a year), he is entitled to
only £4OO, which is equal to two-thirds of
the amount he was drawing 15 years ago ;
and with a Treasurer like McPherson in
power his chance of getting the bond varied
isn’t too rosy. The worst time Bruford had
during his official career was when he was
chief clerk under E. J. Thomas in the Pre-
mier’s Department. There was more ability
in the first joint of Bruford’s little finger
than in Thomas’s whole body. Thomas was
a mosquito-like martinet, whose departure,
which had no obstacles put in the way by the
late J. B. Patterson when Premier 25 years
ago, caused general rejoicing. Thomas got
even by drawing a pension of £6OO a year.
Minogue, the present Under-Treasurer, who
already gets £IOOO a year, is not hankering
after the Auditor-Generalship, which is paid
at the same rate. If he decides to stand
aside, Brennan, of the Railways, or
Morris, of the Treasury, may have a close
run with Agg, Deputy Auditor-General, for
the post.
Simpson Newland, of S. Aus., born at
Ilanby, Staffordshire (Eng.) reached his 83rd
birthday this month. He arrived with a
party of immigrants brought out by his
father, the late Rev. R. W. Newland, when
the State was in its third year. The family
settled at Encounter Bay, and Newland has
been associated with that locality ever since.
His book, “Paving the Way,” is an inter-
esting record of the early days of the South-
ern districts. For the last 35 years New-
land has been opposite the public eye as a
member of the Assembly, as a Minister of
the Crown, and as a writer on matters con-
nected with the Northern Territory and
river Murray.
Concerning a family of good Australians:
Guy Dawson landed just as war broke out, and
immediately joined up with King Edward's Horse,
fought through the earlier battles of the war, was
wounded, and had a spell in Blighty. Then he
gained a commission in the Seaforth Highlanders,
and after two-and-a-half-years’ continuous service,
his nerves playing up, he was put in charge of
the farming operations in
Northern France, with
400 prisoners and huge
tractors to do the work.
His next step was a cap-
taincy and a French
decoration — the Merits
Agricole. At the last
big push of the enemy he
had to retire with his
prisoners and outfit, but
has moved forward
again, to “harvest the
crops,” if possi-
ble. lie has had four
Christmas days in the
war-zone. Oswald Daw-
son enlisted at Victoria
Barracks, Sydney, but
was discharged after ill-
ness following on vacci-
nation. He then went to
England and joined
K.E.H., rising to ser-
geant. After 10 months’
fighting in France he
gained a commission in
the R.E., passing fourth
out of 48 in the exams,
ut Newark. Later he
transferred to the
R.A.F., and was sent
east, and has now been
awarded the D.F.C. Roy
Dawson followed the
trail, and the three bro-
thers met in the front
line in France, after not
having been together for
11 years. Cas and a
wound sent him tc
Blighty. Wilfrid, the
fourth brother, was un-
fortunately “t u r r, e d
down” ; and Eustace, the
youngest, enlisted before
he was 19, and was pre-
paring to enter camp at
Liverpool when the shut-
off whistle blew. The
five are sons of R. W.
Dawson, the stock in-
spector at Goulburn
(N.S.W.). The family
claims 48 relations on
active service (11 killed
and 10 wounded).
“Diaphragm”: The late Capt. Tom Ham-
mond was born in Blighty, and stayed there
until he was 13; then he went to sea for a
crust, and his wanderings brought him to
Australia, where he tried the tropics of the
Nor’-West. I met him in Broome, the place
ol: pearls and storms. He was then a messen-
ger in the Broome telegraph office. In
between times he practised lightning-jerking.
Y\ hen war came in 1914, Hammond tried to
!> with the Aussies at once; but the
I ost Office held him for a while. He landed
® u early in 1915, as a private with
tfie -8th Battalion, and later scrapped on the
feoinme. At Flers he lost an arm ; but even
tr.at laid him aside only temporarily. Re-
covering sufficiently to again be of some use,
work on records was offered him; but he
preferred to be back in the noise instead, and
managed to get there; and went over the
top tor the last time at Morlancourt, where
hewas mortally wounded. They called him
lhe Man with the Stick” owing to his
men ° f USmg t lat weapon in directing his
WAIF AND STRAY.

‘‘Fugitive Ex-Kaiser.” “Flight, to Holland.”
Other Monarchs in Hiding.” —Headlines from cables.
The kings are taking to the wood,
Like hunted hares they double.
Their rights divine are little good
In this their time of trouble.
How many kings are hid to-day
By spider (loyal weaver) ?
Of monarchs who have run away,
Without a crown, some e’en may stray
Without a single stiver.
Most strange and curious to me
This thought of kings in hiding.
I picture monarchs up a tree,
And emperors abiding
In hollow logs. You turn about
A stone upon your rambles,
A startled sovereign scuttles out,
And darts for cover up a spout,
Or hides among the brambles.
You hear some furtive cteature stir
In dust above the ceiling,
And in the dusk and cobwebs there
You find an emperor kneeling.
So many little kings have fled—
Grown sadder and much wiser—•
That now the lady long unwed,
Who seeks a man beneath the bed,
Is apt to find a kaiser!

A point which is likely to tell heavily against
William Hohenzollern when he is tried at
the Old Bailey, London, or some such place,
is the medal which he struck and widely
circulated to commemorate the sinking of
the Lusitania. As regards some other things
he may declare that he was in hod at the
time, or absent in the country, or that he
was misreported, but that miserable medal
is solid evidence. And it has grown and
grown till it has become as heavy as a mile-
stone—one of the milestones used in the
mills of God, which grind exceeding small.

The long-drawn-out engineering strike still
flourishes in Melbourne, but the “slow strike”
at the abattoirs has been called off. Things
became so slow that the birth-rate in the
slaughter-house was overtaking the death-
rate, and the business became ridiculous.
The visit of the French Mission to Adel-
aide has renewed interest in the old
French expedition which was sent out
at the suggestion of the Institute of France
in 1800. It took 220 days to reach Australia
from the time of leaving Havre, and the
Frenchmen had a very unpleasant journey.
With putrid water, weevily biscuits and salt
horse the sailors had reached the limit
of endurance on arrival. S. Aus. was given
special attention by the party, and the chart-
ing of Spencer and St. Vincent Gulfs —dis-
covered by Flinders —and Kangaroo Island
was some of its best work. Flinders met
Captain Nicolas Baudin, who was in charge
of the French at Encounter Bay, and there
is a metal plate. on the Bluff, near Victor
Harbor, bearing the following affixed to a
granite rock:—
In commemoration of the meeting near this Bluff
between H.M.S. Investigator (Matthew Flinders’),
who explored the coast of S. Aus., and M. F. Le
Geographe (Nicolas Baudin), April 8, 1802. On
board the Investigator was Jno. Franklin, the Arctic
discoverer. These Fnglish and French explorers
held friendly conference. Hence Flinders named the
place of meeting Encounter Bay. Unveiled by his
Excellency Lord Tennyson, April 8, 1902.
The rock upon which the permanent record
of Baudin's visit to Kangaroo Island was
inscribed by a member of the party is now in
the Adelaide Museum. The expedition had a
hard time, and only three of the 23 scientific
men and artists who sailed from Havre
returned to France.
“Chin Strap”: Very few people in Aus-
tralia realise how seriously the submarine
campaign affected England. For a little
while the outlook was very dark, especially
in the opening months of 1917. With the
parks tilled and every vacant allotment under
cultivation, the population was assured of
ample food when the crops were ready in
the Spring, but the winter had to be gone
through on extremely short rations. This is
how we fared at Wareham, an Australian
camp in Dorset. Breakfast: One thin slice
of stale bread (dry) and a wafer of bacon, size
of two penny stamps, with weak tea, minus
milk and ' sugar. Dinner: Just sufficient
roast or boiled meat, barely enough turnips
and potatoes to soil a portion of the plate,
except when meat was off (meatless day
three times per week), or when the potatoes
failed to arrive (two potatoless days per
week). When the two less days hap-
pened together our midday ration was called
by the mess-orderlies “short soup.” It was
thin slush with slices of turnips for flavoring,
and short of everything that ought to go to
make soup. We soaked onr bread in it and
made a move for the canteen or Y.M.C.A.
hut, where Australia’s empty spaces were
filled with tea and cakes, until the authorities
prohibited the sale of cake and biscuits
before 5 p.m. For tea we had a slice of
bread (it was issued cut up from the Q.M.
store one slice per man before each meal),
and enough jam, margarine or treacle to
cover it. We never saw butter. This was in
a convalescent camp, and the winter was the
coldest on record for 30 years, yet fires were
not allowed in the huts betweeff reveille and
retreat owing to the shortage of coal. ' How-
ever, we were cheered up by reading iff the
newspapers that at the German prisoners’
camp in Dorchester, close by, the Ffitzes had
refused to work because their ration' of
butter teas being reduced!

“Bill, when I told her I killed a German with one hand she grabbed it and kissed it all
over.”
“Why didn’t y ’ tell her you BIT the blighter to death?”
On circumstances and kings:—
Rumor, a voluble old woman with protruding
teeth, has it that the abdicated Kaiser is house-
keeping in Holland and proposes to spend his declin-
ing years and his money in that country. Which
suggests, a 3 usual, that he doesn’t know how to get
down off the pedestal of his dignity fast enough.
He may be brought back to give evidence before a
commission. He may be wanted On an extradition
warrant for murder, piracy, the removal of State
jewels (he is sure to remove State jewels) and the
abduction of valuable documents (he is sure to take
valuable documents with him). His property—what
he leaves behind and what he takes with him—-may
bs confiscated towards an indemnity, and the Dutch
or other Government may be served with an attach-
ment. The world has grown very small for William.
The only really promising place is Mexico.
In all the world it remains as the one
big and fairly powerful civilised State which
has no injuries to avenge and which, by
reason of its ill-feeling towards the United States,
showed a friendly countenance towards William all
the time. Apart from this possible refuge there are
two notable precedents that the Kaiser might con-
sider. One is that of Robespierre, who realised that
he was a lost man sooner or later in Paris, and
probably lost everywhere else. He stayed in Paris
and was lost. The other case was that of Nana Sahib,
about whom an absurd fuss was made because, being
a man with a real grievance, he killed a person or
two at Cawnpore. In the Hun army he would have
been regarded as a weak philanthropist who took an
interest in the birth-rate. When the cause for which
he fought was lost the Nana simply stepped out by
night and melted into the mass of the population.
He didn t pose as a king in exile or a hunted patriot
or anything else; he just went somewhere and looked
ordinary. Some people say he is still alive. Only a
great man could efface himself like that. The
Kaiser would give himself away by blowing a trum-
pet in seclusion and pounding on a drum of brass.

Henry Daly, ivho was the contractor for
the bells in Sydney’s Post Office tower, lately
yarned affectionately about his vociferous
progeny. Hunting up Tennyson, Daly had
inscribed on the tenor, or hour bell (five
tons) : “Ring out the false, ring in the true” ;
on the first quarter bell (32cwt.), “Ring out
the feud of rich and poor” ; second quarter
(Lycwt.). “Ring in redress to all man-
kind ; third quarter (18cwt.), “Ring out
false pride in place and blood”; fourth
quarter, “Ring in the common love of good.”
The bells were cast by John Taylor and Son,
of Loughborough (Eng.). Henry Parkes was
IN. S. Wales Premier at the time, and his
initials were inscribed on the hour bell
called, consequently, the “Great Parkes.” or
Great Harry.”
“Corio”: I met him as he topped the rise
in the gully. He was perched on a pile of
kegs, pipe in full blast. “Humping water?’’
I inquired. He drew a match along the rim
of a keg, relit his pipe, and said: “No; I'm
cartin' explosives for the railway works.”
“Croson” : In view of Labor-member Bill-
son’s recent ugly charge, in Vic. Assembly,
that a firm supplying gas-mantles to the Rail-
way Department habitually removed the
label “Made in Japan’’ from the goods sup-
THE WISE ASS.
WIFE: “How horrid you are lately; you
weren't a hit like that before we were
married."
HUB : “Which shows how environment is
stronger than heredity.”
plied and put on one inferring manufacure
in Australia, it seems to me the time has
arrived to arise and do something drastic.
With the continual evidence being afforded
us of the superiority of Australian goods, it
is time we compelled our own manufacturers
to brand their goods “Australian,” with
thumpinig penalties for those infringing.

PEACE?
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now is all business stopped, and work and traffic,
To give a doubly needless holiday;
Now do cold-footers howl and yell and “maffick”
And “flappers” fling all modesty away.
This is the Antis’ day, the day for Shirkers’,
And racecourse scum, and touts —and worse than
they—
For monkey tricks that shame all honest workers,
And pranks no decent larrikin woidd play.
The senseless jangle wakes the senseless city,
And, till the night, no wit nor humor clean—
No gleam of real sentiment or pity,
Or nation’s pride illuminates the scene.
And, to complete it all, from alleys rotten,
Where nought save memories of vice remain,
The wretched “talent” and the long forgotten
Slum “push” creep out into the light again.
They bleat their ignorance to walls that smother,
While beach and breaker call for them aloud ;
And sad-eyed strangers—strangers to each other—
Our soldiers go unnoticed through the crowd.
Our soldiers pass, unnoticed and unheeding—
These are no mote to them than “dugout rats”—
They only dream of working and succeeding
And shake confetti from their honored hats.
(The dear old face, crape-framed, but wanly bright-
ened—•
God-shielded on the kerb she stands alone —
The Hear old faith —her load to-day is lightened ;
The dear old smile—her pride is all her own.
All this is for her sons, she thinks; and hither
.She drifted with tfe crowd, a tiny blur.
Mother of Men! Are shades of soldiers with her?
Does any of this rabble notice her?)
Now will each practised turncoat and seceder,
Of any class or party, clique or sect,
Say to his followers: “You can trust your leader!
Did I not tell you what you might expect?”
This is the time the perfect politician
Is always on the platform (and the job) ;
And glib, and smug in his assured position
He periods the obvious to the mob.
Now will the Parties rave, and every faction,
And fighting sect, devoid of gratitude,
Refreshed by four years’ rest go into action
With all its old vindictiveness renewed.
Now we shall hear the things that danger banisht \
The selfish crank, the shrieking suffragette;
And all such nightmares that we thought had vanished
Shall rush upon our sleep—-lest we forget!
I ask myself: “Are these the things they fought for?
The boys who trained and gripped and died like
men ?”
I ask myself: “Are these the things we wrought for ?”
And think of long grim battles with the pen.
I raise my window sash, and sit and wonder,
While gazing upwards at the starry dome,
Will men say in their hearts, that grand sky under—
“lf this be peace, God send us war at home?”

“Snap”: I guarantee this: When the Hun
had been driven from a Somme town, parties
began the unsavory job of clearing up the
mess he had bequeathed. Incidentally, they
had to bury a score of odoriferous Huns. One
body, which was found sprawled across a
footpath, went off with a bang when the
Diggers touched it. Some distorted devils
had actually mined their dead comrade who
a few days previously was fighting beside
them! The explosive did its work: four
Aussies had to be taken to hospital.
* * * *
The proposal to exclude liquor from the
peace celebrations recalls two old Van
Diemen’s Land proclamations. In the first
number of the Hobart Town Gazette, pub-
lished June 1, 1816, it was officially
announced that George lll.’s birthday was
at hand, and that half a pint of spirits
would be furnished to each “soldier and con-
stable, that his loyalty may be duly main-
tained.” A few months later, on February
19, 1817, the foundation-stone of the first
Hobart church was laid. Governor Davey
proclaimed a Thanksgiving Day, and
ordered that a half-pint of spirits be given
the soldiers and constables, that their thanks
might be fittingly rendered. Last week in
Sydnejq when the official news of the fall of
Germany was published, the inhabitants
were prevented frpm drinking the toast of
the King in even half a pint of shandygaff
to show their loyalty.
WARNED OFF.
“And if .that ’ Ohenzollern bloke ’as the ’ide to
come ’ere we won't give ’im a blanky
cave."
The simple faith in the immortality of
the soul still lives. A recent death-notice in
Sydney Telegraph was “inserted by his
everlasting friends,” X. and Z. Blank.
RELIEVED FROM ANXIETY.
MRS. LIEUTRNANT JIM SMITH : “You were
always complaining before the war about
Dick’s late hours, but now lie’s away all
the time you seem as merry as a
cricket."
MRS. CAPTAIN DICK BROWN : “Ah, yes. It’s
such a comfort knowing he was safe at
the Front when last I heard of him.”
“Vineleaf”: The debonair young man
stopped me with an apology. Could I oblige
him with a match? I could. With a com-
monplace remark he lit his pipe, returned my
box with thanks, and was about to go his
way when there drifted up to us the most
mournful-looking man in Melbourne. His
dark brown eyes held such an appeal (like a
dog that is trying to beg off a whipping) that
we hesitated while he spoke: “Sare, if you
please, one moment. I am hungry, ver’
hungry, and I hav’ no money. I hav’ try
for work, but find him not. Now I hav’ only
this watch left, and I wish sell
him. Will you buy him for a
pound? The good God will
bless you, sare. He cost ten
pounds. I buy him in Genoa.”
The debonair young man was
plainly affected by the evident
distress of the foreigner. He
examined the watch which the
latter had produced, and saying,
“Yes, it’s a good one,” handed
it back. “I’m sorry,” he added.
“I’ve only got a few shillings
on me, so I can’t buy the
watch; but here’s a couple of
bob for a feed and a bed.” The
mournful-looking man drew
back indignantly. “Sare, lam
no beggar!” he exclaimed with
dignity. “I sell the watch; I
do not cadge.” The young man
was evidently distressed. Turn-
ing to me he said: “Could you
help the poor beggar? The
watch is worth far more than
a quid.” Now I was also anxi-
ous to help him, but, unfortu-
nately, Mrs. V. was spending my
last note on boots for Vineleaf,
jun., so I was in the same posi-
tion as the d.y.m. So, express-
ing mutual regret we three
parted. I happened to be re-
turning that way a quarter of
an hour later, and judge of my surprise to see
my debonair young friend stop another man
and borrow a match. And, lo! there drifted
up to them a mournful-looking man with a
watch to sell! And then a great light burst
upon me.
On the big day of rejoicing the anti-liquor
party had its way. Never before was
the city of Sydney so noisy, the crowd
so completely irrational. Ragamuffins jeered
in the faces of decent women; grimy louts,
with feather-ticklers, pushed these unclean
offences into the faces of sweating
demonstrators as much in need of a bath as
themselves, and then rushed on to carry the
insanitary effects to well-washed children;
mad pilots of motor-cars, re-
joicing that peace had brought
them relief from the obloquy
of shirkers, tore about the
streets without regard for
traffic regulations; and, amid
all the uproar, crippled sol-
diers limped, painfully con-
scious only that they had aided
in a victory for freedom whose
first showing was a loud noise
and a denial of their indivi-
dual liberty. The uproar ex-
hausted itself
within the two
or three days’
orgy; but the
dirt remained
over, together
with the memo-
ries of insults
and injuries
wrought in the
name of joy. It
was the wow-
sers’ triumph.
Tli e y demon-
strated to all
who saw it the
extent to which
a city could be
drunk without
liquor. Only on
Thursday, when
the h o t el s
opened, did
sobriety return;
and then the
moderate person
who had borne
the brunt of four
years of irra-
tional stress was
compelled t o
pick his way delicately through the polluted
aftermath of a celebration after the pseudo-
reformer’s heart. “Victory and the tea-pot”
was the watchword but there wasn’t
enough tea-pot to go round. Bung looked
on and wondered. With beer at fullest flood
he had never achieved anything like it.

“L.L.W.”: Talking about “economy” on
the part of Australia’s Education Depart-
ments (“Schoolmarm,” B. 7/11/T8). In
Bananaland a married man teacher is allowed
rent allowance if no house is attached to the
school. A dominie who decided to risk get-
ting married applied for leave to do the deed
on July 2, which fell on a Monday. He was
granted leave from the preceding Friday
After his wedding his first cheque had Is. 9d.
rent allowance deducted.
* * * *
“Billy T.”: He was a slipshod, haggard
man, whose clothes were much worse than
they had any need to be, since private in-
quiry in the nearest ashbin might have re-
sulted in the recovery of a vastly superior
outfit. He led by the hand a wretched child
obviously ill, her dirt exaggerated, her cloth-
ing admirably calculated to break any
motherly heart. He had a thick, throaty
voice and a graveyard cough, and wept like
a dripstone. He was begging for the where-
withal to provide his “pore cheeild” with bed,
bread and medicine. He had an answer for
all arguments, among others the piteous
assertion that he could not part with little
Nell to send her to a public institution, she
being the last of a large family, and the
living image of her dear, dead mother. He
received money and goods. When next Drip-
stone Jimmie called he solicited cash to pay
the doctor, and to provide the champagne
and certain piedical discomforts ordered for
the saving of the invalid. A week later
Dripstone Jimmie visited us once more.
Little Nell was dead, and there was posi-
tively nothing in the house to bury her.
When little Nell was securely buried, money
was needed to erect a small, simple
memorial. A fortnight passed, and Dripstone
Jimmie reappeared as a worthy object for
charity in his own right. He was now a sad
sufferer from paralysis (two sorts, he said),
and as his copious weeping threatened to
spoil the sake of the house already suspected
of dampness, we gave him a shilling, and let
him go. Three days after that a small child
came begging on behalf of Dripstone Jimmie,
who was now bedridden and in need of rich
living and strengthening drinks. The small
child was little Nell. “But, my dear child,” I
said, “this is preposterous. You are dead
and buried. You have had a small, pale,
stone tablet erected over your remains. Why,
you have been dead a month !” Then that
dear child woke up. “Just like the dam’ old
fool,” she said. “He would have it I wasn’t
dead in this district!”
“Tarago” : It was commonly stated among
Australians in France that the Lewis
machine-gnn, so universally used by British
troops, was the property of the Belgian
Government. The patent was said to have
been offered to the British War Office, and
turned down ; Belgium snapped it up while
Fritz was considering it; and during the first
two and a half years of war the initial cost
of each gun was set down at £lO4. It was
worth it, for if any arm deserves the credit
of stopping Fritz it’s the Lewis. The gun
differs widely from other machine-guns. It is
built like the ordinary rifle—slightly larger
in the stock —with a cooling envelope encas-
ing the barrel and a projecting contrivance
frdin the end of the muzzle to hide the flash.
No belt is used, but a circular flat dish called
a panier laid horizontal takes its place.
Round this dish of death cartridges are
placed under a band or spring, which holds
them in the form of a clip. As the panier
revolves on a spindle each cartridge is dis-
charged. When the disc completes the circle
it is replaced instantly with a loaded one.
The method of discharge is a continuous
pressure on the trigger, and it looses off from
450 to 475 rounds per minute. One dis-
advantage is that it has to be carried into the
line in one piece—no small undertaking for
a man over live to seven miles of greasy,
broken, sloping duckboards in seas of mud and
sheilhples. Still, in case of a surprise attack
it is ready for instant use, an advantage not
possessed by any other machine-gun, which
is carried into the line in sections and has to
be assembled before it is brought into action.
When the war was young we were repeatedly
told of Germans found chained to their
machine-guns. I can't contradict this, but
I’ve seen at least half a dozen Fritzes with
a section of a machine-gun chained to their
wrists. That is one of those little details of
thoroughness that helped the Ilun to hold up
civilisation for over four years.
Anti-militarists and others who object to
the young men of Australia being trained to
defend their country should ponder the case
of the men of the Deferred Battalion lately
put through a six-weeks’ course of physical
training at Prahran (Vic.) drill-hall. They
were men who were a trifle below the A.I.F.
standard, chiefly in chest-measurement. After
going through the course, five of the 106
were rejected, seven were given another
month’s training, and 94 passed. Further,
the medical board which examined them was
much impressed by the mental as well as
physical improvement. Isn’t that worth
while ?
THE HANDICAP.
HE : “Y’know, I was born to purple and fine
linen.”
SHE: “I suppose that is why you couldn’t
give them up for khaki when the rush
came.”
Victoria just now possesses a Fish Com-
mission which travels inland a good deal
looking for land-crabs; a Drift of Population
Commission whose business it is to find out
everything except anything which may pre-
vent Melbourne owning the bulk of the
State's population; a Railways Standing
Committee, and a Traffic Congestion Commit-
tee, which was last heard of in Sydney,
though how Melbourne’s traffic became con-
gested in Sydney no one knows. Commis-
sions gravitate to Melbourne about Cup
time, but after that they drift Sydneyward
for the surf-bathing. In the winter they take
evidence around Cairns.
IN THE WAVES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
My love is in the salt sea
And I am on the land ;
The little heat -waves come to me
And fill my mouth with sand.
A surf of perspiration flows,
Around me as I move,
And rivers trickle down my nose,
My faithful heart to prove.
My love is in the salt wave.
Oh, glad she is and free;
For some are near her life to save
From out the cool, green sea.
But I must save her life as well
Here, toiling in the heat;
Yes, howsoe’er the tides may swell,
She must have things to eat.
In Ilell they made the undertow
That, like a furnace blast,
Comes dragging from the pub I know
When closing-hour is past;
But I shall catch a homing train
And little comment make,
But keep my fevered forehead calm
As juicy fillet steak.
Beside the portals of my pride
With gladness shall I see
The cool, sweet girl that is my bride
Awaiting me for tea.
I, from the surf that breaks in town —■
A hundred in the shade—
Shall clasp my sea-nymph bathed and brown
From waters where she played.
Ah, well! The show costs twelve-and-six,
The gas account is due;
And someone has the bills to fix
And pay for Irish stew.
'Tis sweet to think through days that tire
There stands the changeless rule,
That I, with all the air on fire,
Am warm as she is cool.

Judge “ Adamax” Roofing by the company it keeps. Its selection for
use on the foremost big jobs of Australia offers clear proof of its
superior quality.
As a result of such severe competitive tests 120 miles of
“ Adamax” Roofing have been used by the Imperial
Government on various Wool and Wheat Depots through-
out Australia—ordered because “Adamax” has proved
itself to be “The Best Roofing that Money can Buy,”
5000 sq. yds. of “Adamax” used on C.5.A. Mine
Buildings at Kandos, N. S. Wales.
“Adamax” is the ideal Mine Building
Roofing because it resists Acids,
Gases or Chemical Fumes, and
because the elements have no
ill-effect on it.

POLITICAL
POINTS
SAFE —IN THE MEANTIME.
BULL HOHENZOLLERN : “My vurd! Mighty
lucky for me dot I vos neffer quarrel
with Holland as I intended to do.”
No sort of luck attended the union ballot
ordered by the Perth Labor Conference, on
the proposition that the Hun empires should
be asked to condescend to grant peace, they
retaining all their colonies, and Alsace-
Lorraine and their Italian and Czeck and
Polish and Danish and Serbian provinces
and paying no fine. It was started with the
assurance that the decisive defeat of the
enemy of freedom and civilisation was im-
possible, and the conference seemed as
pleased over this idea as if the Hun paid it a
regular salary. Therefore it was urged that
we should be humble and polite to the Kaiser
and the Junker and do no last-ditch act in
the cause of liberty. The ballot dragged its
length alopg like a battered reptile amid
constant news that the military caste of
Germany was going down. It finished amid
scorn and contumely just about the day
when the caste went down. Then it was
announced that the pro-Hun vote was in a
great majority, but the figures were sup-
pressed. After that the dead body was
stealthily removed and buried in silence.
THE LESSON.
THE NEW SCHOOLMISTRESS : “You haven’t
done badly at your drill, but you have
sadly neglected your home-work. Now
you must try to do better.”
There are some abject institutions hanging
about, but for poverty of aspect N. S. Wales
Minister Hall can be recommended. The
other day a deputation spoke to him about
the unfinished and unused Bombala railway,
where £400,000 worth of work is perishing
under the weather and costing £20,000 a
year interest, and it suggested that the trifle
required to complete the work should be
found somewhere. And Hall replied -
Now that the war is over it might be possible to
get LOAN MONEY. This line would be the first
to be gone on with when LOAN MONEY was avail-
able.
With a peace income which is expected to
reach £24,000,000—£10,000,000 more than
in the present crowd’s- first year of office —it
seems that State of disease called N.S.W. is
still unable to build a yard of railway with-
out loan money! Yet the worm-Government
doesn’t seem to know that it is‘a worm.
Very few worms do. The Nimmitabel-Bom-
bala railway, which is losing £20,000 a-year
in its > unfinished condition, is. it may ,be
mentioned, an extension of the Joppa-I'jFim-
mitabel line which lost £02,545 last year. It
would have shown a profit of £3856 if it had
/been built out of revenue, but it wasn’t.
“Mustard Gold”: Compared with the old
hands of the Mcllwraith period, when such
men as Griffith, Macrossan, Hodgkinson,
Moreliead and Groom made the laws of Ban-
analand, the crew running the State now are
commonplace and trifling. For some time
past Queensland has been the most inhar-
monious portion of the Commonwealth, rent
with sectarian hatred, festering with indus-
trial nastiness and worse. Ryan has little
control over the crowd of which he is the
accredited leader. In fact, the personality
needed to handle the divergent and turbulent
factions, embracing a rotten foreign element
constantly endeavouring to foment discord,
is not on the political deck. Macartney,
Opposition leader, is cold, repellent, cynical,
possessing little to inspire a public or party
following. He is a dry, matter-of-fact law-
yer, swayed only by the logic of the law-
courts and knowing of, or caring little for,
the human attributes which determine the
value of leadership. Looking down from the
Gallery as I write, Bebbington, member for
Drayton, is attempting to speak amid a
chorus of howls from Ryan’s henchmen.
Another Oppositionist follows, and the air is
rent with more howls. Ryan sits back and
placidly smiles. The boys do as they like;
wherefore he is the ideal leader. I have seen
many a better-conducted tap-room than the
Queensland Assembly.
At last Federal elections the Nationalist
party put up Sergeant Charles Copeland
against Labor-leader Frank Tudor. Copeland
polled fairly well, considering the vastness of
Tudor’s previous majorities; but Nationalism
has since shown no sign of urging him on to
further efforts, preferring its older, balder,
more politically-experienced Liberal hacks
when it has been possible to urge their claims.
Nowadays, . pending further developments,
Copeland is keeping his hand in by platform
appearances with a touring concert co.
A matter that is hanging fire to the verge
of monotony is the attitude of the Federal
Labor party re the repudiation of the public
debt. That swindle was considered by the
Perth Labor Conference —a body that was
authorised to speak for the Labor movement.
in all Australia. The Confer-
ence didn’t repudiate the pro-
posed robbery as contrary to
its conscience and the con-
science of any decent person. It
treated it as any ordinary pro-
position to be adopted if it
seemed profitable—in other
words, if the thievery would
pay it was apparently willing
to be any sort of mean thief.
The question was referred to
the Federal Labor party, which
was left to reoort on the advi-
sability of the embezzlement.
Since then nothing has been
heard of the suggested piracy.
The Federal party hasn’t de-
clared indignantly that it isn’t
a liar or a burglar or a bush-
ranger. It has made no haste
to clear its character—perhaps
because it doesn’t think that
the suggestion casts any
smudge pn its character. So
the position is that the highest
representative body of the
Labor movement has asked it
to say whether a gigantic fraud
should be done or not, and it
reserves the right to decide in
favor of the gigantic fraud. A
body that is in such little haste
to dissociate itself from a pro-
posal of the kind must be of a
contemplative and ruminating
disposition. Before people put their money
in a new loan they have a right to ask if
the next Government intends to steal the
money. The prospective Government was
asked by its own party to say Yes or No,
and' it didn’t say No.
“Ida D.”: Apropos the recent pars, on
aboriginal place-names. Why wasn’t the
Federal capital called “Gininderra”? —which
is quite close to the site. It means “a big
frost.”
Senator Gardiner clattered for nearly 12
hours at a stretch last week. “The late
war,” he said, “was largely let loose because
Germany, in 1871, had insisted on taking
French territory.” But the late war didn’t
start because the Hun took foreign territory
in 1871; it came about because he wanted
more territory in 1914. And the Hun made
the mistake of trying to annex peoples who
were ready to die in the last ditch rather than
part from their freedom. None of the Hun
colonies have put up a wild-cat fight rather
than be torn from their Hun. They almost
seemed glad to lose him, and they didn't
applaud worth 2d. when the Australian
Labor leaders wanted to hand them back.
The destiny of the German possessions in
the Pacific generated a heated atmosphere in
the Reps, last week. The so-called “pacifism”
of Considine caused a violent counter explo-
sion, especially when he defined annexation
as a euphemism for “capitalistic expansion.”
Considine has an extensive repertoire of
lumbering and meaningless phrases, and
delivers each one like the credo of a devout
churchgoer. Brennan, who followed, strove
to impale the Government on Point 5 of Pre-
silent Wilson’s Fourteen Conditions —that in
“determining colonial claims” the “interests
of the populations concerned must have equal
freight with the equitable claims of the Gov-
ernment whose title is to be determined.”
Presumably he has a brief for the simple
children of nature in New Guinea and there-
abouts, and has overlooked the case for Aus-
tralia. A general Hate campaign seemed
imminent until the Speaker quelled the dis-
turbance with a few firm words. ()f those who
addressed the House on the main question
Jowett, the sheep king, was the funniest and
Fowler the most sensible. Jowett’s Imperial-
ism was delivered under a full head of
steam, and when he syrened that the posses-
sion of Germany’s colonies would make the-
future safe for Australia, for the Empire and
for civilisation, it w r as brutal of Matthews to
pull him up and remind him that the
islands would not grow sheep! Fowler
suggested that the most pressing requirement
of the moment was a more responsible repre
sentative than Hughes. In his view the hys
teria and ease with which the leg of the littb
man is tugged by political jobbers in Englam
make him diplomatically negligible in negoti
ations that obviously demand great tact am
calm.
“0.L.”; Some of those engaged on soldiers
land-settlement schemes in Victoria seem stil
to be suffering from that tired feeling. Fran!
Clarke, Minister for Dairy-farms, has had tc
apologise for the fact that some returnee
soldiers on the Manifold Estate, Camper
down, are living in cowsheds or under canvas
the Public Works Department not yet having
been able to put up the simple cottages re
quired. Clarke cites a shortage of materia
and lack of suitable labor as the chief reason;
for the delay. A tour of the timber stack;
around Melbourne, some of them grown t(
immense proportions in anticipation of big
building-activities after the war, would show
little in support of the shortage statement
For hardwood, which the commercial pres;
certainly alleges to be scarce, the fixed prict
is 20s. per 100 ft. super; but the Government
could get all it wanted by judicious buying
front private sawmills at a much lower rat*
than this. Local weatherboards and lining;
are also obtainable as wanted, in spite of tin
alleged scarcity. As for the lack of labor
Clarke evidently doesn’t speak from his own
knowledge, but goes by what certain peoph
tell him. Ten houses a day are at present
being completed by private contractors withir
the metropolitan area, without apparent
labor difficulty except for an occasional dis-
pute with the hod-carrier and the post-hole
navvy. Carpenters actually come cheaper than
most tradesmen, and therefore can’t be scarce.
Clarke might try a shilling situations-vaeant
advt.: or, better still, he conlel ’phone Cen-
tral 8550. That’s the Repatriation Depart-
ment, which daily advertises a large supply
of waiting labor, “in all trades.”
Corboy, the young Westralian Laborite
who won the late John Forrest’s seat
in the Reps., has for his main qualifica-
tion the gift of the gab, but it doesn’t
amount to oratory. He would, no doubt, not
have had the selection-ballot ticket wen
it not that his party looked upon the Swar
seat as a sure thing for Hedges, the Nation
alist candidate. Unfortunately for Hedges
two other Nationalists competed and splii
their side’s votes, so that he ran only a gooc
second. Had the voting been on the prefer-
ential system, Corbody would be still a pri
vato citizen.

mill, at one-twelfth of the cost. It says some-
thing for the progress of political education
that the Victorian farmer, or a large body
of him, should at last advocate the working
up of this country’s own products within its
own boundaries. What the Union should
now do is to try to show a little enthusi-
asm about tariff matters. It is easy to talk
about establishing national industries, but
the advice should be accompanied by an ex-
pressed intention to see that those industries
are permanently protected.
OUR LITTLE KINGS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The world rings with the praises of our fighting
men. They have proved their manhood, and
through their valor and the constancy of those
behind them at home Australia has won a place
in the world of free nations.” —Governor Davidson.
X. S. Wales.
Autocracy is broken! Spread that shout
That all the shames of earth may shake and fear \
When the great kings are driven forth in rout,
How shall the petty despots linger here?
Let in the light. Break down the close-barred door,
Freedom is free to reign for evermore.
The German scorns his bondage. Russia strives
Through vaster agonies to vanquish wrong.
By that red price we paid the faith survives
In the world-heart that truth alone is strong.
The meanest serf looks up to the wide sky,
A newer manhood in his kindling eye.
Shall we alone, in servile idleness,
Submit to chains our brothers will not wear?
Let petty tyrannies about us press,
As those who cannot feel or will not care?
Shall it be said Australia was the last
To free her from the bondage of the past ?
Our lords are little things that fume and fret,
Yet hold us down because we yield them grace—
Hull potentates of office who have set
Their hands to tear the charter of our race.
While the war reddened, these, in Prussian mood,
Usurped our rights and scorned us where we stood.
King George we own with liberal respect,
As freemen own the system of their choice.
Amid the shows of things he stands erect;
And when he speaks we hear a people’s voice.
He is no despot; but our own small things
Are tricky as a nest of German kings.
Send them out quietly. The ballot-box,
That weapon we have lost, we must regain.
No need for revolution or the shocks
Of angry mobs our purpose to explain.
Let us move quietly and, as one boot,
Kick them out altogether, branch and root!
Autocracy is broken! Let them know
That it is broken here as well as there.
If they have faith in freedom, bid them show
Their four years’ work to the full light and air.
No public secrets now ! We have grown wiser.
Who blinds our eyes is brother to the Kaiser !

A Word of Advice
to the users of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills.
TO the many thousands of people who are daily using Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills it might
not be amiss to suggest certain precautions in view of the danger of the Influenza
epidemic extending to Australia. The one thing of paramount importance is to keep the
system in proper working order, so that no geims get a chance to stait incubation. Theie is
nothing better sold for this purpose than Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills. They are a searching,
cleansing remedy, but their action, though mild and gentle, is thoroughly effective. Petroleum
Oils Salts, Tonics, Cough and Cold Cures and other so-called remedies are of little use to
cleanse the system and keep these germs in check; in fact they will have a tendency to aggravate
an already deranged gastric condition.
At such a time it stands each individual in hand to keep a close watch on themselves to
maintain their usual standard of health. A dose of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills two or three
times a week, or one or two pills each night is advised ; it would also be advisable to take from
5 to io grains of ASPIRIN two or three times daily, if feeling out of sorts, or io grains of
QUININE on retiring at night at the same time the pills are taken. A common cold can
usually be broken up if either QUININE or ASPIRIN is taken with Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills, as directed, on the first indication.
Should, however, an attack of Influenza develop, lose no time in sending for the family
doctor, and go to bed at once. This is the best advice that can be given. Don’t try and
doctor’ yourself. If you have the real Influenza your digestion will be a wreck, your head, legs
and back will ache, your heart action will be affected, and you will have a temperature. 1 hese
conditions need the attention of a skilled medical attendant. He may continue the treatment
indicated above or he may not, but it will be only safe for the person affected to at once go to
bed when the first definite influenza symptons appear and place yourselt wholly and unreservedly
in the doctor’s care. _

“The Bagman” : If anyone wants to view
the real autocrat of any bush township, let him
approach the bloke who officiates as M.O. at the
“darnce.” For the few days immediately preceding
the hop he must be kept in “good form” by all
hands. Should anyone concerned with the shivoo
give him offence he may promptly decline to act —
SOMETHING TO GO ON WITH.
LAWYER: “You say this man hit you. Have you any eye-witness of the assault?”
CLIENT : “Only mine, sir.”
an unimaginable calamity. Sometimes he requires a
little persuasion to officiate, and has to be “squared”
accordingly. The main qualifications for the job
are 5-h.p. lungs and a pugnacious chin, with a
memory for the various evolutions of which he bel-
lows the changes; and then he also has to know the
tarts and blokes sufficiently well to give them an
“intro.” There are various ways of keeping order.
Remember once, in cow country, the local parson
was given a most pressing invitation to a district
social. lie asked why they so particularly wanted
him to attend. “Well,” explained the R.S.V.P.
man, “some of the blokes wot brings their own
beer gets a little lively like, and starts biffing one
another, and we thought p’raps if you could show
up in jour rig it would keep things a bit more
sociable like.”
* * * *
“The Wanderer”: A tough bashman's light
went out at the Glebe (Sydney) the other night
when Jimmy Keppie slipped away at 75. Keppie
used to drive a bullock-team ’tween Mudgee anil
Dubbo before Mudgee had the railway. Later he
worked on the railway at Dubbo, and lost an arm
while shunting. Then he got the Glenfield station
to look after (Southern line). Later he resigned,
went back to Dubbo, and drove a horse-team ’twixt
Dubbo and Goonamble ere the latter place was linked
tip. His dad was amongst the first to swing a pick
on the old Meroo goldfields (Mudgee district). The
lad who has just died has left two boys shouldering
rifles in Palestine. One of them is just 40 years
young.
* * * *
“Mrs. Lance Lawson” : The sight ol' their
own blood will send aboriginals into hysterics, but
1 am convinced they feel little or no pain from even
the severest injury. On one occasion, when dragging
a young gin from a shark.that had her foot in its jaws,
she looked up and remarked casually, “Mine tink it
dat shark been tak it mine foot!” The sight of the
blood upset her for a while ; but a few hours later
she was playing euchre with the rest of the camp.
The wonder is that wounded blacks don't more often
bleed to death, for they take no special means to pre-
vent it. The most approved method used to he to cover
the wound thickly with fine mangrove ash, and
over that a big dollop of damp clay, which was not
removed ior several days. Never saw them Wash
a wound, their theory being that the blood heals
the wound. In later years they all learnt
to go to a doctor when injured, but 30 or 40 years
ago one saw dreadful deformities resulting from aeei-
dents and lights. On Fraser's Island in the ’seventies
there was a man whose leg had been broken in two
places, below the knee. Neither fracture had
knitted and ho was a most grotesque object to
meet. The doctors wanted to mend him, but he
kept out of their way. Another case was an old
gin whose arm had been broken between the wrist
and elbow. She used to prise the bones one against
the other, and she could give a terrible blow with
the loose hand.
“Itarawai” : Can any stockman, bushman,
Billjim or horse-poet come through with a cure for the
horse that blows himself out when being saddled
up? When Tinribs is. being girthed he is as full of
wind as Holman at a by-election, and I can’t deflate
him by the old dodge of walking him about when
girthing up. A horse that wants to be an observation
balloon is no good to me.
“H.V.E.” : Re the bunda-bunda or ringed
snake, which “Melos” says is found in all parts of
Australia. Writer during a long experience has
never seen or heard of it either in Monaro (N.S.W.)
or South Coast—though this, of course, is not saying
that it does not occur in these quarters. Waite, too,
refers to it as “one of our commonest snakes.”
Many snakes are almost as secretive in habit as the
mysterious brown eel, which appears as though by
magic in isolated ponds and waterholes remote from
THE PATHOB OF IT.
DAMAGEB RABBITO ( gloomily ) : “Rabbits is fourpcnce — an’ me Iyin' ’ere.”
any known source of supply. Can “Melos” name a
silvery-grey snake (said to be non-venomous) which
occurs occasionally on Monuro? It is about 3ft. Gin.
in length and rather thin in body. The deadly brown
snake, by the way, varies from brownish-grev to
copper.color, which camouflage makes this savage and
determined fighter very difficult to spot when on
barren country. It is very common about Monaro
weirs and creeks, but in a wide stretch of country
immediately bordering the coast below, where the
carmine-bellied black -devil is very common, I’ve only
seen one brown—an old seven-footer.
“Lautana”: If any cocky farmer knows a
better wood-preservative than this, let him coo-ee.
Stir boiled linsecd-oil into pulverised charcoal till
the mixture is as thick as paint. Put a coat of it
over the posts, and there is not a Chinaman who will
live long enough to see the posts decay.
* * * *
“C.E.8.”; Sturt’s desert-pea vvill trans-
plant. When in far west N. S. Wales last year I
was shown quite a number of plants in full bloom,
growing in front gardens, which had been trans-
planted. If care is taken in removing the young
plants, no roots being broken and it is carefully
planted, it will grow and thrive. When returning
to the coast I brought with me a number of seeds
gathered from a plant which had been transplanted.
Some of these seeds were-put in on the Macquarie
Range, and a fair percentage germinated, though I
cannot say if they are still living. The remainder I
sowed in my garden in the Rawkesbury district.
From six seeds, sown in gravelly soil during April,
I got three plants.
* * * *
“Bung”: We were cleaning up our dig-
ging-out contract on C'urrandooley (N.S.W.) when
we witnessed this example of maternal fidelity. To
finish up the rabbits that didn’t burrow, we had
collected a small regiment of any-breed tykes. A
beagle among them followed the scent of some
kangaroos that for months we had spared in the
run, and after some hours brought them slowly
loping by the camp. Away went the whole pack of
mongrels, and in the tussocks below we saw the rear-
most flier throw aside a well-grown joey. Then ma
fled after her companions, but before our curses
reached them the dogs had torn up the little chap.
Next afternoon a single ’roo wandered back. We
stoned back the mongs ; and in spite of their yelling,
within a stone’s-throw of the camp, the mother
pathetically searched the flat for her baby.
* * * *
“D.F.”: A. S. Meek, who lived for some
time in Bananaland and afterwards did a lot of
collecting in New Guinea and the South Seas for the
Rothschild Museum, asserts that in the dry parts of
Australia some of the native tribes used to seal up
the sutures of skulls and use the bone billy for
carrying water in. Never heard of it before, but
Meek is a hardened Christian.
“Melos”: The scarcity of food, due to the
severity of the winter, just past, lias driven a number
of shy hush-birds into the country towns. Tlit
gardens of the N. S. Wales Northern Rivers district
are now haunted by many*varieties that usetl to shun
houses and camps. The other day a brace of tree-
creepers visited mv plot for the first time, and several
little tit-warblers foraged in a vine close to where
1 sat, despite the fact that a butcher-bird, their
arch enemy, perilled on a nearby tree. As time goes
on probably the more valuable insect-destroyers, “such
as the shy mountain-thrush, brown tit-warbler and
scrub-wren, may join the congregation. As birds
usually seek fruit to get a' drink rather than food, it
would be a wise provision to place a dish of water
conveniently in the orchard.
“A.” : I’ll guarantee that this bait will get
the crow. Mix strychnine with fresh blood, and
place it about in open tins on the tops of sheds, fowl-
houses, etc. The strychnine should be dissolved in a
little vinegar before mixing with the warm blood, as
this will ensure a thorough mixing throughout.
* * * *
“D.F.” : The bullrush is a good food plant
according to the old-time explorer Thomas Mitchell.
He said that the principal food of the natives on
the lower Lachlan appeared to be the root of the bul-
rush, and that one of his own party, Charles Webb,
made some excellent cakes of it, which seemed lighter
and sweeter than those made from ordinary flour. It
has also been alleged that the young shoots are a
very fair substitute for asparagus.
* # * *
“Wai-hoi”: A few years back I paid a
second visit to Houtman’s Abrolhos Islands, 40
miles towards Africa from Geraldton (W.A.), where
the terns, principally the noddy (Anons stolidus)
and the sooty (Micranous tenuirostris ) have been
dodging sanitary rates since the islets appeared
above high tide. The value of the Abrolhos wa-
first recognised by F. C. Broadhurst, and he got a
lease of them from John Forrest’s Government to
work the immense guano deposits, 6ft. thick in
places, and in a few years had made a pile, inci-
dentally paying over £20,000 in royalties to W.A.
I have seen some marvellous things in bird life, but
nothing to beat the huge rookeries, covering many
acres, where from November until the following
March, ma and pa look after the family. On Rat
Island, where the sooties covered seven acres closely
packed, we tried an experiment. We roused the
millions of birds, but before doing so we tied a
bit of string on one lady’s ankle and put a check
label on her nest and chick. Twenty minutes after-
wards, when the birds had got tired of aeroplandng
over the reefs, ma came home to her youngster as if
nothing unusual had happened. There were a million
homes, all built on the same pattern.

OLD IRON-GREY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Though once he fed on Lachlan grass
And ranged the plains, a rover—
Old Iron-grey has had his day,
His prime of life is over.
From street to street, and lane to lane,
His lot it is to travel,
No pastures sweet beneath his feet,
But grit and grime and gravel.
With drooping head and hopeless eyes,
From dawn to dusk lie trudges
With weary gait; for tyrant Fate
Has placed him with the. drudges.
’Twixt ragged shafts that gall his sides
From rut to rut he ,stumbles,
While at his heels a curse of wheels
Forever grinds and grumbles.
Though once, on all the Lachlan-side,
No hoof than his was faster
Old Iron-grey has had his day,
And Age is now his master.
Old, broken, worn—no dream is his,
The while his rest-hour' passes,
Of mornings blue and early dew
Upon the Lachlan grasses.
Kicked, clouted, sworn at though you be,
The mock of man am’ woman—•
Bear up, old horse; things could be worse—
You might be poor and human.
For, though you fed on Lachlan grass
And ranged by creek and river,
Grey memory brings no visionings
Of gay days dead forever.

“Drofsed” : It is strange that no descrip-
tion of the boomerang’s curious flight is to be found
among accounts left by early Australian explorers.
Some men were under the impression that the
boomerang was a kind of sword. Peron called
the' boomerang a “sabre ft ricochet.’’ White,
in his “Journal of a Voyage to N.S.W.” (1788),
also mistook the, boomerang for a weapon used sword-
fashion, for he termed it “a humble form of scim-
itar.” The description of this weapon’s flight first
appeared in Sydney Gazette, 1803. It was called,
therein, a “bent waddv like a scimitar.” The name
boomerang was first given to it by Captain Philip
King in a paper entitled “On the Maritime Geo-
graphy of Australia,” read October 2, 1822. In
this paper King said that the natives adjacent to
Port Jackson called it the “boomerang.” For the
sake of a definition we may call it a gyroplane (i.e.,
a flat spinning weapon) capable of describing a more
or less horizontal and circular flight. The arms of
the boomerang are slightly twisted on each other,
giving it the “lift,” which is also greatly assisted
by bevelling. If we were to spin it straight forward,
the boomerang itself on its flat, with rounded side
up, would rise quickly in the air. If reversed and
thrown it would immediately drop to the ground.
Boomerangs are made in different angles. Obtuse
and acute-angled weapons are the most difficult to
throw, while the right-angled variety is the easiest.
Provided the centre of gravity or centre of spin
is well within the arms of the angle, any angled
boomerang will travel more or less successfully—
according to experience in imitating Binghi. The
boomerang, in a good flight, is thrown so as to spin
rapidly. It thus becomes part of a spinning disc.
Hence, theoretically, any shape preserving the para-
bolic twist—yet part of a disc—is capable of a
return flight. Among the stone-cut boomerangs
(kylies) of Western Australia, are found a variety
that are covered with small shallow grooves, which,
in the opinion of some, assist the flight by “biting”
the air, like an indented golf ball.

“Azac”: For scrub-itch get on to this for
relieving the infected part: Dab a damp rag on car-
bonate of soda and then on to the itching portion of
the body. The cure is almost instantaneous. Don’t
rub the infected part.
“Bootawa” : lias any Abo. ever heard the
anvil-bird? It is a very rare and exceedingly shy
creature. Its clear metallic note rings out “Kling,
kling, kling, kling,” several times in measured
tones, and then mixes it up thus: “Kling kling, a
ling, kling a ling.” It is the hardest of all bush
birds to locate, as it mostly does its blacksmithing
in the topmost branches of the dense brushwoods.
It is almost as hard to find as an excuse for Aus-
tralia standing for W. M. Hughes in England, or
wherever he is.
* * * *
“Wai-hoi”: Ever been bushed at sea? The
lugger that runs between Darwin (N.T.) and the
Bathurst Island mission station, 50 miles north, put
up a pretty good performance in her early days a few
years back. At Thursday Island th e craft was
handed over to a Manila crew for delivery at her
island destination. These men don’t worry about
chronometers and sextants, but trust to dead reckon-
ing per an antiquated compass. The boat (now
called the St. Francis) sailed west from T. 1., and
instead of lifting the shore of the Gulf of Carpen-
taria missed the headlands there and went poking
nor’-west out to the open sea. Six happy weeks went
by, the skipper meantime gaily looking for the Gulf
beaches until he was intercepted by the Pioneer, 100
miles west of Carnarvon, on the W.A. coast. He
uas over 2000 miles out of his course, and doughbovs
and fresh water had long since gone off the menu.
This in a run of 500 miles!
* * * #
“Eddyson”: T. Tellfin lived on the Wide-
way in the gibber country between Wesley and Kybrong
(Vic.). Why he lived there Heaven alone knew,
and Heaven keeps its secrets. But there was a little
payable alluvial about, which could be worked when
there was water, and as there are always men who
will hang on to a bit of alluvial in defiance of all
sense and law, it may not be necessary to appeal to
the supernatural. Teddy Tellfin \vas a true
hatter. He had built himself a neat slab
hut in a country where art and diplomacy were called
for in getting two decent slabs out of a single tree.
About this hut Tellfin had made an exquisite garden,
a garden meticulously kept, a miniature Eden into
which no slug might trespass, where scarcely a fly
might venture to tread. From town Teddy secured
the newest plants per post, and he set them and
cherished them with a fatuous kind of devotion
exceeding that of any mothering woman. When the
Black Drought struck Wideway and blasted the
whole countryside with a withering curse, every other
vegetable thing curled up and evaporated; but Teddy
Tellfin’s garden remained green, because Teddy went
for water to the last slimy holes of Little River,
pestilent with the bodies of animals, and scraped
up moisture for his precious plants, carrying it
three miles in a pigskin, as did the Israelites of old.
But the time came when Little River was not visibly
wet anywhere within nine miles, and Tellfin’s garden
wilted, faded, crumbled, and was blown to the south,
whither all creation seemed to be tending, and Tell-
fin’s grief was that of a good father who sees
his loved progeny fade and die under his helpless
hands. Came the day when George Orb, carting a
barrel of drinking-water from Wesley to Johnston’s
homestead at Shanghai, was waylaid by a pathetic
object, begging a bucket for pity’s sake and the love
of Heaven. The little, frizzled, parched wretch was
Teddy Telfin. He was willing to give 7s. 6d. for the
bucket of water, and after many prayers he got it.
Five days later Teddy Tellfin was found by Hobhouse
on the verge of collapse in his hut, and taken to
Kybrong, where the doctor explained that he was
close up to finish for the want of drink. When
Htbhouse told the story to George Orb, the latter
in some amazement explained the incident of the
bucket of water. “That,” he said, “should have kept
him from actually doing a perish in this time.”
“Yes,” Hobhouse admitted, “but we brought two
plants in with us. Teddy insisted on having them.
They were green and blooming. Teddy gave that
bucket of water to his azalias!”
* * * *
Azac ’: The Department of Agriculture
(N.S.W.) is busy on the grasshopper pest, and
ha:--, appointed Gurney, the Assistant Entomologist, to
try his hand at poisoning them in the Scone district.
The poison used is arsenate of soda (11b.) mixed with
1(> gallons of water and' 31b. treacle; the latter con-
stituent acting as a kind of camouflage. The mixture
is sprayed on to the swarms and adjacent grass, and
is the subject of very unbecoming language from G.
Hopper. Gurney finds himself in this predicament,
however. The howled-down starling is assisting him
so much in the work of ridding the country of the
hoppers that he is tempted to take it to himself as
a bosom friend. The law says that he shall not; it
being listed as one of Australia’s greatest pests. Yet,
there is no doubt that the starling does a great deal
of good in devouring such pests as grasshoppers.
Proof of this has been given at Scone, where the
stomach of a starling was opened and was found to
be full of grasshoppers.
“K.S.”: Are Australian snakes cannibals?
I think not; neither does Dudley le Soeuf (Curator
of the Melbourne Zoological Gardens). He says
that there is only one snake which habitually preys
on other snakes, and that is the hamadryad snake of
India, a large venomous reptile. Le Soeuf says that
two snakes occassionally get hold of the one rat,
frog or similar food, and as neither will let go it
follows that one generally swallows the other, but
it is an accident rather than a habit. All the same,
it has occasionally happened at the Melbourne Zoo.
* * * *
“Paul Cupid” : Of all the cures for rheu-
matism gohanna oil, as has been said before, is first.
1 was deputed by a mate, who had rheumatism so
bad in the knees that he had to say his prayers
standing on his head, to get him some go’ oil. In
doing so I ran much risk, for the station regarded
the big lizard as a godsend on account of its
partiality for young rabbits, which it consumed in
great quantities during the summer months. However, I
banged over a couple of gohannas, tried the oil
out and sent it to the cripple. Three months after-
wards he won a footrace. I wish King Offa had had
some go’ juice rubbed into him the night before the
Cup.
* * * *
“Dook”: Re “Pick’s” (B. 31/10/18) de-
scription of Binghi’s method of making a boomerang.
Here’s a much simpler method, as shown me by an
old black, Billy Hookwin by name, who lived here
(Jamberoo, N.S.W.). He simply shaped the boom-
erang arid then drilled two small holes, each about
one-sixteenth of an inch in diameter and about a
quarter of an inch apart in the elbow of the boom-
erang and the job was done. Time, 20 minutes or so.
This boomerang would circle quite readily even in
the hands of a novice.
The voice of the koala (native
hear) is no longer beard crying in the wilderness—
so far as most of the forests of N. S. Wales are con-
cerned. On Monaro highlands, for instance, where,
25 years ago writer has spotted as many as four
hears on one large white-gum, the somnolescent koala
has passed out, stricken by a kind of paralysis,
which left him unable to mount more than a few feet
up the butt of a tree. Have heard odd bears calling
in remote South-coastal (N.S.W.) forests, but in this
quarter, too, the gum-leaf chewer is little more than
a memory. In earlier Monaro day's it was not
unusual to find a bear, which had, scrambled over an
iron roof all night, comfortably seated on the chim-
ney of the house in the morning, awaiting events.
Wonderfully brainless and unsuspicious of danger,
Hill Gumleaf has sometimes been found perched on a
low stump or post, well within dog-reach, or marooned
on the open plains, far away from the nearest timber,
and crying pitifully like a mislaid curate. The strange
paralysis aforesaid is also said to have attacked
native bears in southern Bananaland, resulting, as in
N. S. Wales, in their partial extinction.
“Alofa”: “Melaleuca” (B. 17/10/18)
claims the introduction of bees to Australia for a
Dr. T. B. Wilson in 1834. I don’t agree with him.
Gregory Blaxland, who arrived at Sydney by the
William Pitt in 1806, brought among other livestock,
a swarm of bees in the cabin with a wire cage over
the hive,’’ and I would not venture to claim the first
introduction even for him. It is hardly likely the
first pioneers would let nearly half a century pass
without having a trial at bee-keeping.
A MINOR OPERATION.
“Well, doctor, do you think it is anything serious?”
“Oh, not at all. It is merely a boil on the back of your neck, but I would advise you
to keep an eye on it.”
HER EFFICIENCY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dan called to see Bond's Mary Jane,
A big girl, ginger-headed.
Some people thought her not so plain,
Yet Mary was not wedded.
Dan came on her with zeal immense
Erecting chains of dog-leg fence.
Dan came again one morning fair.
He leisure had in plenty,
But Mary had no time to spare,
For she was milking twenty.
Dan sat aside, and, being Scotch,
He slyly timed her with a watch.
The third time Dannie chanced that way,
Some kindly greetings dropping,
He did not push his suit. All day
The girl was busj' chopping.
Upon a butt of box she stood.
Her axemanship was really good.
Once more bold Dannie sought her out,
And she was tater-hoeing.
At last there lingered scarce a doubt.
His hand discreetly showing,
“By Jove,’’ he cried, “I think you’ll do.
If you can plough I’ll marry you.”

has to be seen and used to be appreciated It is
manufactured and laid in the sheet after the manner
of linoleum, but with this difference—it lasts a lifetime.
As a floor covering it is noiseless, non-slipping, water-
proof and thoroughly sanitary. Its construction
enables it to be laid upon existing floors, whether
of wood, stone, cement or iron, and to conform
with the plans of any hall, room, etc. There are no
cracks to hold dirt, consequently there is the minimum
trouble in cleaning. All joints are lapped and perma-
nently fixed with rubber cement; is made in runner
formation with solid back in any length, and from 10"
to 12" wide. Thickness H" or X" as required. The
design is not a surface one but is so inset as to ensure
permanency of pattern. The cost of installation is the
first and only one, and on account of its remarkable
durability it is the most economical floor covering ex-
istent. For Banking Chambers, Corridors of Public
Buildings, Hospitals, Billiard Rooms, Ship Saloons, Bath
Rooms, Vestibules, etc., this matting is ideal—the
weather has no effect on it. Made in various designs
.and color schemes. V/e shall be pleased to submit

THOSE STANDARD AUTHORS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We writer folk who’re busy still,
Contriving books for men to read,
With certain literary skill
Are all misfortunate indeed
In that our task must ever be
Made difficult to a degree
By many dead men’s rivalry.
The doctor scores a meed of gain
When dies a big competitor;
The lawyer sees his rival slain,
And has a dozen clients more ;
The architect, and actor too,
Ait helped by Death to chances new,
And see great benefits accrue.
Dead men our keenest rivals are;
Their 1 books repeated without sense
Fill all suburban shelves, and bar
Our dusty way to affluence.
As ’tis we never may secure
The .splendid sales that would he sure
if our books sold as furniture.

“Den”
Another volume has been added to the
“Bloke” series; and the best praise that can
be given to it is to say that it is equal in
interest and artistry to the work which has
placed C. J. Dennis so high in popular, favor.
Digger Smith is not so much a collection
of verses as a narrative poem with all the
interest of a first-class novel worked out in
varying moods and metres. Returned sol-
diers take the centre of the stage; and round
the wings is heard the chatter of good Aus-
tralian women and the picturesque speech
of wholesome Australian men. Mar Flood
is a very winsome old person; and Dad
Flood, with his sturdy independence and
superficial hardness, wins a solid respect.
Digger Smith, who describes himself as “ ’arf
a man” and does the work of two, is the typi-
cal returned-soldier mate. There is real
pathos in the yarn when Jim comes home —
Jim, the prodigal of the family in pre-war
days, who has made good on his passage
through the camion smoke.
An’ as we talk 1 sees along the road
A strange bloke lumpin’ some queer sort uv load.
I points ’im out to Smith an’ sez,: “ ’Oo’s that ?
Looks like a soldier, don’t ’e, be ’is ’at?”
“Stranger,” sez Digger, “be the cut uv ’im.”
But trust a mother’s eyes ....“It’s Jim! My Jim!”
There is a tremendous welcome for Jim; and
in the midst of it Dad Flood is seen standing
by the house :
I seen the mother pluckin’ at ’er dress;
I seen the girl’s white face an’ ’er distress.
An’ Digger Smith, ’e looks reel queer to me:
Grinnin’ inside ’imself ’e seemed to be.
At last Dad sez —-oh, ’e’s a tough ole gun !
“Well, are yeh sorry now for wot yeh done?”
.Tim gives a start; but answers with a grin!
“Well, Dad, I ’ave been learnin’ discipline.
An’- though I ain’t quite sure wot did occur
Way back” —’e’s grinnin’ worse—“l’m sorry, sir.”
(It beats me, that, about these soldier blokes:
They’re always grinnin’, like all things was jokes.)
P’r’aps Dad is gettin’ dull in ’is ole age.
But ’e don’t seem to see Jim’s cammyflage.
P’r’aps ’e don’t want to, for in his ole eye
1 seen a twinkle as ’e give reply.
“Nex’ week,” ’e sez, “we will begin to cart
The taters. Yeh can make another start.”
There is? lots of genuine Australian humor
in the book —humor without horseplay and
•without sign of being forced. Nowhere does
the verse sag nor the yarn lose its grip and
interest up to the final heart-calling verses
entitled “A Square Deal.” Dennis has an
enormous public to appeal to ; and if he con-
tinues to produce work of this standard he is
certain to maintain his place.
Digger Smith is issued in two forms- —a
small quarto of the type its publishers have
now made so familiar, and a pocket edition
for the soldier bloke and the man who wants
to put it in his swag. The illustrations,
which are plentiful and pleasing, are by Hal
Gye. (Published by Angus and Robertson,
Sydney.)
A Satchel of Books
In Foodships of Britain. Will Lawson explains the
work of the Maoriland Department of Imperial Gov-
ernment Supplies. Bill Massey supplies a foreword,
mentioning incidentally that “100,000 of the cream
of our population joined the colors.” But it is over
the vast supplies of cream converted into butter that
William seems to gloat most, happily. Lawson’s yarn
is mostly statistical, the crux of the arithmetic being
the very solid fact that since the war happened Bro-
ther Bidl had up to August last paid Maoriland
£70,413,868. These are impressive figures, and if
the reference to “the torrent of gold which pours
across the world to the Dominion” has an odd sound
it doesn’t matter much if anyone points out that
there is no torrent of gold, or over likely to be,
Anyone who wants to find out exactly how Maoriland
handled the export business and how Massey battled
for shipping space—to get the measure of the
profits brought by war to the wool man and the
cow proprietor and the mutton specialist, will find at
least the main part of the story in this well-arranged
booklet. The Supplies Department seems to be a par-
ticularly well-managed outfit —to be capable of doing
big things without either fuss or giving imitations
of the Australian Defence Department.
The City of Riddle-Me-Ree, by Zora Cross (Angus
and Robertson, Sydney). This dainty little booklet
of child verse, with its charming illustrations by
Olive Crane, maintains the author's reputation as a
singer. It is probably the longest-sustained fairy-
tale in verse yet written in Australia ; in fact, it is
hard to remember anything just of the kind written
anywhere else, 'the verses lilt brightly along; and
although the kiddies will find full delight in it, there
is poetry there for those who keep the child heart
after the schooldays are gone. Boy Blue and Bo
Peep are prominent characters in the tale; hut the
theme itself is entirely new:—
“So if you are troubled or tired to-day
With toys and dull lessons, oh. sail off with me :
And there with the fairies we’ll laugh and we’ll play
In my land of young hearts down at Riddle-Me-Ree.”
It is very well worth while making the trip in the
ship whose sails are “the silk of a butterfly’s wings.”
Jingles that Jangle, by James A. Philp (Brisbane,
Exchange Printing Co:). A collection of verses of
local interest to Queenslanders, with a few of general
interest to Australians. The author says in his fore-
word that the book is issued to give expression to a
sentiment of “tired contempt” for unpatriotic Aus-
tralian communities. It. does that with some vigor
and an occasional hint of humor.
Business, Robbery, etc.
The advantages of being an importing
country are becoming more evident daily—•
unprocurable lines are rapidly increasing,
and the S. Aus. Irrigation and Reclamation
Works Department are up against it hard to
get supplies. Large engines, fencing-wire,
wire-netting and galvanised-iron are as
scarce as Germans in Pleaven. Tenders
were called recently for some wire-cable,
previously bought at £3O a ton, and there
was only one reply. The price wanted
was £47<S per ton ! The Department has been
compelled to place concrete roofs on houses.
Practically all the Commonwealth Govern-
ment departments have the same plaint-
lack of materials.

“Broker” : The recently imposed additional
duty on manufactured spirits of ss. per
proof gallon, making a total increase of 11s.
(from 14s. to 255.) since 1915, has hit the
liquor-trader so hard that, apart from six
o’clock closing, the old days of fat profits
have departed for ever. An eternal lack of
unity in the retail trade has made any gen-
eral increase impossible in spite of numerous
attempts to reconcile differences. Local
changes—coopering, wharfage, cartage, bond
rent —have bounded up with freight, insur-
ance and other war risks, apart from two
new ones, “setting up” on wharf, and “stack-
ing” recently imposed here. The cost of
"wood” (casks) is prohibitive, a hogshead
now costing £5. A good bulk Scotch whisky
of a well-known firm landed here in 1914
and 1915 on indent at 3s. 3d., was recently
disposed of at 365. and 385., and other better
qualities touched 425. net in bond, and the
terms were immediate cash only in exchange
for bond warrants. Brandy of a good quality
has jumped from 6s. to 365., Lowndes’ rum
from ss. to 265. Champagne in greater or
less quantity has been evacuated from the
Boche-battered Rheims district uninterrup-
tedly for four years, in perfect “condition”
at a not greatly increased cost, but Dutch
“square face” gin in cases of four gallons has
increased from 12s. 6d. to 110 s. in bond, and
is unprocurable. All of which, of course,
has helped a comparatively new Australian
industry.
“Edo”: Kalgoorlie Returned Soldiers’
Association recently started a workshop, in
which men waiting for permanent employ-
ment put in time making* small articles of
use, which arc disposed of to the public.
Among other things, excellent axe-handles
are manufactured out of Westralian needle-
wood, and axe-handles are in great demand.
Yet the local traders, instead of encouraging
what might grow into a fairly large local
industry, look cross-eyed at the home-made
article. When they do buy they give only
Is. each; but they sell at from 3s. 6d.
to ss. each. It’s only a bloated profit that
would induce them to touch the poor native’s
home-made goods.
* * * *
“T.”: When the long struggle ceases there
is going to he a lot of argument as to the
actual date of the “end of the war,” and as
this will have an important bearing on many
contracts, etc., the House of Commons re-
ferred the question to a select committee,
who reported:—
The committee agrees that the date of the end of
the war in relation to the powers conferred by
emergency legislation should he held to be the date
when the treaty of peace is finally binding on the
respective belligerent parties—that is, the date
when ratifications of the treaty are exchanged or
deposited. This is on the assumption that the war
is ended by a general treaty of peace between the
United Kingdom and all the Powers with which
the United Kingdom is at war. If, on the other
hand, the United Kingdom were to make a separate
treaty of peace with an individual enemy Power,
the end of the war with that Power wouid be the
date when the ratifications of the treaty were ex-
changed or deposited, but that might have little or
no effect on existing emergency statutes.
The question of war-time liquor bills, etc.,
will interest Australia, and there will no
doubt be a determination as to the date of
the end of the war by the Commonwealth.
Doubtless war-time prices will continue for
some time.

“Table Talk”: It is about 50 years since
the Chinese first began to spoil cedar
in Sydney. Before that makers like Hinton,
Pearson, Artlett and others sunplied the
demand for furniture, plenty of which can
be seen to-day. as good as when it was made.
When the yellow men got into the trade
white makers got out, and in 10 years the class
of cabinet-work in Sydney was the lowest on
record. From that on it improved. Some
of the aliens became fair tradesmen, but the
“white” work was given to new-chum
Asiatics to learn on, and the result would
make a European cross-eyed. Then. mach .
came and gradually wiped the Chings o
the white-wood trade, they being searea
machinery, but their method of compet
compels the machine-operating hrms to a P
cheap methods of construction. '
class maple, the best wood tor
work that we have, and good colon _
pine are being made into .r ur ?* k Ol .
that is a disgrace to the trade. If the ti
was properly seasoned and well made up.
furniture would last three times as long as
it does, and would cost only about ou pci
cent, more than at present. If this w
done, and only second-class, stnlt made
cheap goods, our supplies of soft woods, nev
very plentiful, would last many years, Du 1
the present waste goes on the exhaustion
the softwoods is in sight.
“F.N.T.”: Stringy-baric (“Australian oak”)
is still relatively cheap in Victoria. xe
“non-combine” price for dry stuff is only ou.
per super foot, and I’ve just been naalung
myself a fly-proof door out of some ol it, a
an immense saving, on the cost of the usua
door purchased from a joiner’s. The alrnos
invariable material for liy-doors is
nian redwood, which now sells at < —s. oa.
per 100 ft., nearly three times as dear as
stringy, though the latter, when well-seasoned
and afterwards dried out beside (say) the
kitchen fireplace, will outlast three doors ot
redwood if properly mortised. It’s more dim-
cul to mortise stringy than the softer im-
ported timber,, of course, which fact no doubt
partly accounts for the fondness of the local
manufacturer for the more expensive stuff.
Instead of getting a strong article, made ot
cheaper Australian wood, the householder, as
a rule, lias to put up with a dear, flimsy one,
the average price for a decent
about the same as for an ordinary burglar-
proof house-door of much more solid construc-
tion. Of course, too, flimsiness in fly-doors is
good for the furniture-trade, because broken
goods mean new purchases.
* ■* * *
There are large quantities of dolo-
mite building-stone to be found in the
vicinity of Ardrossan and other parts of
Yorke Peninsula, K. Aus. Hovychin, lecturer
on geology at the Adelaide University, points
out that this is similar stone to that used
for centuries in Europe for important build-
ings. Many famous cathedrals, including
those of York and Durham, were constructed
of it. There are layers of dolomite 100 ft.
thick at Ardrossan, and the deposits could
be worked cheaply. The durability of dolo-
mite is unquestioned, except in large manu-
facturing centres where the atmosphere is
charged with sulphurous fumes, which in
course of time set up a certain chemical
action. on the stone.
* *• * *
“0.L.”: Mostly as a result of the Inter-
State Commission’s inquiry into housing mat-
ters, Labor in Victoria has been raising an
extra loud howl about rents and the scarcity
of small dwellings. Still, considering the
immense difference between the actual cost
of an ordinary five-roomed wooden house
and its price when “retailed” by a time-
payment speculator, it’s hard to understand
why the more substantially-funded unions
don’t combine to start a building-society of
their own. Of recent years many a working
carpenter, enjoying the advantages good
wages, has built himself a house with Aus-
tralian timber, using (1) his own labor;
(2) part of his earnings; (3) some of his
brains, and (4) little talk and plenty of
toil. Even nowadays, the framing for a
five-roomer only costs about £4O; and an
adequate truckload of building sizes can be
bought direct from the ranges for £lO
less. The co-onerative society idea applied
to house-construction would seem, on paper
at least, to offer the toiler a chance to get
a permanent roof over his head without any
considerable risk to the various parties.
* * * *
Owing to the scarcity of suiting materials
S. Aus. tailors are complaining that the
wholesalers refuse to sell them a piece of
Australian tweed unless a length of im-
ported cloth is bought at the same time.
Well, the shoddy must be got rid of some-
how.

“G.A.”: Australian woolgrowers are con-
gratulating themselves. The South African
wool congress which met at Pretoria rejected
the offer made by the Imperial Government
last year to purchase the clip on lines similar
to those adopted in Australia. The South
Africans favored the open market by a big
majority. Recent cables now indicate that
the growers there realise they made a big mis-
as the prices obtained in Australia were
higher than the South African rates. The
Commonwealth pastoralists did the more
patriotic thing, and the right thing for their
pockets too. Sometimes it happens that
way.
* * * *
“Fine Gold”: As “Mustard Gold” says
(B. 10/10/TS), the “commercial” is not
what he used to be on the Westralian gold-
fields. Pie is now more like what he ought
to be. In the old days the booze-drummer
who “shouted” most got the bulk of the pub
business irrespective of whether his liquors
were poisonous or not, while the bagman
who cut the greatest dash or was willing to
load up and give unlimited credit to retailers
had a big pull over the storekeepers’ trade.
One low-down caller on Outback traders got
himself appointed travelling representative
of a notorious week-end sheet, and did well
for a time by puffing those who gave him
orders and running down those who didn’t.
By taking a few cases of this, or a dozen
boxes of that, a customer could rely on being
described in the next issue of the rag as a
man of some intellect and standing, while the
hapless storekeeper who said he didn’t want
boxes of anything, run the risk of having
doubts cast upon his legitimacy or the honor
of his wife. Finally two or three irate vic-
tims in one centre got some tar and feathers
together and gave the rotter half an hour to
leave the town. He left, and never returned.
Nowadays the wholesale houses pick their
men very carefully, and do not allow them to
do business on the old lines.
THE PAYING GAME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Before the Housing Commission in Melbourne the
other day a witness who had been a news-vendor
admitted that he possessed 17 houses, and declared
that he stood no hankey-pankey from his tenants. If
they were not prompt with' their rents, out they
went.
The newsboy stoutly in the street,
With raucous voice, on tireless feet,
Hawked weeklies to the surging throng,
And sold his Ages all day long.
The newsboy laid his savings by,
And saw the balance piling high.
The writer sat within his den,
And bravely plied a fluent pen,
Wrote verse, or tales, or ,column screeds
On turnips, sheep, or poultry breeds.
His average earnings they were such
That savings did not irk him much.
The newsboy bought a little cot
One year, and next a corner lot,
And then he paid a hundred down
Oh one small terrace out of town.
The rents, as he astutely guessed,
With management would do the rest.
Oft at the writer’s lines he’d glance,
On thrift, investment and finance.
The vendor went with little rue
To one whose rent was overdue,
Ejected him. You guess, no doubt,
This left the writer clown and out.
MORAL.

Which of us are “best sellers” here.

Tlie Beale Piano Aeiion-
cl few oJT its superior features
I. The whole of the Beale Piano action is
manufactured from a special kind of timber
which does not split, warp or crack. It is
exceedingly tough and the various parts can be
brought down to the light weight necessary for
a light touch, without sacrificing any of that
strength which durability demands.
2. The hammers, dampers and all other felt
pieces used in the Beale Piano are made from
pure, Australian Merino Wool of the finest
grade. Such wool will remain “live” for the
greatest number of years, giving a quality of
tone that is appreciated by the true music lover.
3. Every piano - action mechanic knows the
superiority of the front escapement, double-
repetition type of action, such as is found in
our instrument. This is the most responsive,
sympathetic and utterly reliable action known
to piano builders. It guarantees a “touch"
that delights the technically proficient musician.
4. A Beale key, made of genuine spruce, from
a built-up piece of timber; the strongest
possible construction. Ivory is the pure, white,
fine grained East African and Egyptian variety.
The yellow West African and Indian ivory is
never used.
When you decide to have a good piano, investigate the Beale. Terms if desired.

Specimen Section of a
“COLO” Tyre
Eight Points of the"COLO”Tyre
(1) TREAD. Corrugated, presenting small sur-
face to the road, thereby saving friction.
(2) TREAD.—A great thickness of rubber, which
is practically cut- and chip-proof.
(3) BREAKER STRIP, which, being made of
loosely-woven, heavy fabric, binds the tread'
to the carcase of the tyre.
(4) PURE RUBBER.—Pure Rubber is placed
under Breaker Strip.
(o) CARCASE.—Composed of five plies of heavy,
long-fibre canvas, heavily impregnated with
rubber.
(6) FULL AIR SPACE.
(7) SIDE WALLS.—Realising the severe work
tyres ar£ called upon to do in the country,
we have placed a great thickness of rubber on
the side walls, preventing water from entering,
as often happens in other makes of tyres after
a few months’ service. Other makes have
very little thickness of rubber at this point.
(8) BEADS are heavily reinforced and skin-
coated with rubber, to prevent rust.

Oiat Bernard Shaw’s entire box of tricks had
been thoroughly exposed by now. Rut here
comes “J.W.” f.B. 7/11/’18) to dig up the
author s boast that he eliminates all love
interest or belittles it, and makes light of the
leading-man. G.B.S. is, or was, an adept at
throwing such-like carefully-prepared dust
into the eyes of his critics in the attempt to
cover up his deficiencies as a dramatist,
imagine Shaw writing a sentimental love
soene! The thing is impossible. It would be
equally futile to ask him to depict a real
hero. No man is a hero to Shaw, who might
be described as all brain and no heart. What
playwright ever attained greatness minus the
latter fitting?
Archbishop Mannix gives his patronage to
a remarkable development in Sunday-night
Bible tableaux at the Cathedral Ilall. The
idea is to revive interest in Bjfile-reading by
presenting living-pictures arranged with pro-
per reverence for the subjects. The Sunday
tableaux in Melbourne are hoped to be of
-special value in the instruction of children.
1 The popularity of “Gazettes” in the
movie business is sending persistent cam-
era fiends out on the track of the
jmmic personage, intent upon trapping
oim m the act, whatever it may be, with
the result that it is now incumbent upon
public men of all sorts to become picture
actors in a sense. Our Australian premiers
and things are conspicuous failures. We
nave Acting Prime Ministers and Acting
Ministers of all sorts all over the place,
and not one of them can act for nuts. Watt
is pitifully camera-shy; Pearce, who out-
breaks frequently upon the screen, has a
nervous trick of taking sneaking glances at
the machine, as if he expects it to explode
presently and blow him out of office.
American and European statesmen are now
all successful movie artists-—perhaps they
take courses in it. President Wilson is as
easy and insouciant on the screen as Carlyle
Blackwell, Francis X. Bushman, or any other
beauty boy of the picks. General Pan sur-
prised the camera men here by always being
id the picture just right, and making his
exits and entrances with neatness and elan
where the. Australians about him were all
utter mugs. Now, no mayor or other
eminent person can afford to be a pathetic
object in the public eye, looking as if he had
been kicked into view and was anxious only
to escape, on his stomach if need be. into
early and utter obscurity; hence the forth-
coming local school for picture posing for
the benefit of ambitious politicians and other
public persons.
“Paint”: As an illustration of the Lon-
don habit of mind, take the treatment re-
cently accorded to George Robey. George
was . ann °unced as a speaker at a patriotic
affair, and came prepared to give a serious
patriotic speech; but the crowd that had
assembled to hear him started laughing
directly he arose, and burst into loud mirth
when he spoke. He was George Robey, so
he had to be funny. That is the London
attitude—all the time, in all walks of life.
It takes a long time for a man, doing good
work, to make a name; but it takes a
longer time for him. doing mediocre work,
to lose it, once he has been marked O.K.
“Private Boxer”: I beg to propose a
hearty vote of thanks to Gregan McMahon's
Repertorians for two things. The charac-
ters, dead or alive, do not take “calls” after
the act-drop has fallen, and the ladies don’t
have the contents of half ii dozen florists'
shops handed to them at the finish of their
job. It seems almost incredible, but the
audience doesn’t appear at all resentful of
these innovations.
It’s “Jack’s Day” every night in London,
so to speak. Three of the most successful
pieces when the last mail left were “The Luck
of the Navy,” at the Queen’s, Shaftesbury-
avenue; “I’or Sweethearts and Wives,” at
the King’s, Hammersmith ; and “The Freedom
of the Seas,” at the Haymarket. This last
is by Walter Ilackett, whose “Invisible Foe”
was recently staged here.
“L.H.P.”: Scenes from two old operatic
friends, “Fra Diavolo” and “The Bohemian
Girl, ’ at the Sydney Repertory Theatre,
Grosvenor-street, recall some memories. The
last professional run Auber’s work had was
at Sydney Royal in 1903 with May Beatty
(Zerlina), Henry Ilallam (Fra Diavolo)
and Lempnere Pringle and Edward Lauri
as the two bandits. Previous to that it
had been done at the Criterion, in 1902, by
Ilallam, with Josephine Stanton as Zerlina.
This American co., however, made its chief
hits in “Said Pasha” and “Wang.”
“P: Balfe’s “Bohemian Girl,” which
came to Australia in 1845, is the “East
Lynne of opera, and many a struggling
manager has had to thank the lady for get-
ting him out of a town. It has been played
in all languages and countries, and Balfe’s
last important piece of work was the re-
writing of it, with additions, in five acts, for
I ans. The score of this latest version was
until recently in the Carl Rosa Library at
the Liverpool Court Theatre. The last pro-
fessional production in Svdney was during
Musgrove’s season at the Royal in 1900-1901.
A true history of the “bird,” its habits
and customs since its acclimatisation
here, would bo a volume of pretty humor, or
a series of “agony columns,” according to
whether you are one who administers the
bird or a receiver-general; for in the
matter of the “bird” it certainly is more
blessed to give than to receive. One instance

Alfred F. Brash :
The Italian music-hall artist is very indifferent,
as is, indeed, the music-hall itself. I have seen
vaudeville shows in most of the large cities and
towns of Italy, and they are monotonous and boring
in the extreme. The curtain rises and a
female comes forward and sings a song with
a wealth of explanatory gesture. Very little applause
is given. If the performer doesn’t get hissed (and
she frequently does) she is a success. A few hand-
claps mean a big success —and the management
straightway renews the performer’s contract. The

SYDNEY ROYAL.
The Boy (Robert Harron) defends the Girl
(Dorothy Gish) against the intruders.
lady then re-appears in another costume (very little
stocking is shown) and sings again. This is repeated
once more, and the curtain drbps. Then another
charmer does her trio of songs, and so the long night
wears on. Very seldom (except in the few leading
houses) is the programme interspersed with jugglers,
comedians or the turns we are accustomed to in
Australia. The Italienne can sing, but she’s a most
ungainly dancer. There are very few male turns.
The audience, among whom women are conspicuous
by their absence, pay their lires to see female
charms. As 1 have said, little Btodking is shown,
and what is displayed is not often too-well filled.
Perhaps that’s the explanation. More, liberality is
displayed above the waist-line. The remarks about
the stocking do not apply here. The songs are all
of a type; gay, lilting refrains with galloping
choruses and risque (to put it mildly) lyrics. The
Italian likes his music-hall ditty well salted. Our
songs don't please . him. Several of- us sang some
of our liveliest choruses to a party" of girls,
whereupon one knelt down and started to offer up
prayer. They considered our sprightly effort a dirge.
If the music-hall patron desires something classical
and heavy he goes to the opera. He goes there
eagerly and frequently. Every little one-house
townlet has its opera season from March to May.
The repertoire, since the war, consists chiefly of old
florid, favorites, such as “Norma,” “La Somuam-
bula. No doubt this is to escape payment of
royalties. Puccini and the modern school are, how-
ever, also featured. The voices are exceptional, but
in most cases the mounting and costumes are ludi-
A Scotch chorus in “The Bride of Lamma-
moor” was more mirth inspiring than the comic
make-up of any low-comedian I have seen. In one
small town where I witnessed “La Somnambula,”
the very buxom heroine sleep-walked across a bridge
plad in a very grimy nightie and a tallow dip.
Unfortunately she broke the bridge, and in her fall
brought down the whole scene (and nearly the house)
and disclosed the beauty chorus changing for* the
next act behind the back-cloth. They were at a
most intimate stage in their disrobement, too. The
evening was a great success. In another town, a
beefy tenor with a remarkably good voice had a
playful habit, at the impassioned moment when he
got into clinches with the heroine (as far as their
combined abdominal rotundity would allow) and,
when their lips were about to meet in one last
long, lingering embrace, of pausing, Vehemently
clearing his throat and spitting copiously but accu-
rate!y over the lady’s shoulder. I am convinced
that the audience regarded as the height of good
breeding the fact that he troubled to turn his head
to do it.

Because sweet Freedom calls!

Beside the regal names.

And speculate about the bill.

Or whose pants are in flames.

THE RELIGIOUS EDITOR.
It was lately mentioned at the Criminal
Sessions in Adelaide that a fresh trial has
been ordered by the High Court in the old
complicated case of some imagined “trading
with the enemy” by F. 11. Snow in the
earliest days of War Precautions; and that a
nolle prosequi has been entered, “owing to
the temporary absence of material witnossses
in France.” So the proceedings, which have
been gradually getting more and more like
comic-opera, have been put to sleep again.
Recently the Bungil Shire Council (Roma.
Q.) drew the Government’s attention to the
fact that many selections in the shire belong
ing to the men who are away arguing the
point with Fritz are being over-run with
prickly-pear. The reply was the same old
weather-beaten yarn—no funds available.
It’s a touching act of gratitude!
One of South Australia’s longest civil trials
came to an end last week. It was an appeal
against the assessment by the Deputy Com-
missioner of Taxes in respect to the Curna-
mona pastoral lands, and the case was before
the Court on 45 days. The Corset case in
1004 still holds the record in S.A. for a civil
trial. The corsets hung on for 52 days, ex-
clusive of judgment, which was delivered in
June, 1906, by Way.
From the Office Architect: —
Careless folk of sorts;—optimists, somnambulists,
bi-metallists and the like—may not have taken the
trouble to notice that a land boom is in progress
around Sydney. There are other land booms, but the
Sydney qne is the biggest. It isn’t a building boom,
for building is too expensive—just a soil or mud or
dust or grass boom. In the Telegraph, of 21/9/’lB,
I fixed my eye on six columns of houses and land
for sale in the ordinary way, and -ten columns of the
same substance to be disposed of by auction —16
columns in all and practically all city and suburban.
The Herald of that date had 35| columns of
similar substance. There were 136 separate auctions
in the Herald, and a lot of them were not only
double-barrelled—they were on the machine-gun or
centipede principle—“ 46 choice allotments,” “17
spacious building sites,” “31 fine building sites,” “15
building sites,” “34 building sites,” “13 building
sites,” also 142, and 11 and 36 and 56 and 25 and
10 and 21 and 112 and 32 and 19 and 16 and other
lots or bunches of unprecedented building sites. The
prices are quite cheerful; in a place 14 miles from
Sydney and far away from any existing or projected
railway, half a crown per inch is not out of the way.
For my own part I don’t see why the public shouldn’t
have a laud boom if it feels that way', provided finan-
cial institutions don't take the values too seriously
and make 75 per cent, advances on them. That was
the undoing of the Melbourne land boom some 30
years ago; financial institutions took the values seri-
ously, or if some of the old ones didn’t new ones
were established for the express purpose of being
serious. It was also what happened to the Maoriland
boom, of earlier days, in consequence of which the
Dominion’s three banks had a stormy time. The
new boom rests on a perfectly new basis. There are
about £24,000,000 more cash in the banks than there
was in 1910—the year before the Federal note issue
started : that is to say, there is rather less coin but
perhaps £35,000,000 more paper. Including notes
in the hands of’the public there are £53,000,000 of
paper in existence, and as this can’t leave the
country, being of no value outside, it is available
inside the country. If there is a lack of productive
enterprise to make use of it, it is just as well to
land-boom with it. Booming won’t take the money
away; it only leaves it in different hands. The Mel-
bourne boom had a sort of currency of its own. It
included the scrip and promissory-notes and uncalled
capital of land banks (some of the uncalled capita]
proved to be worth id. in the £ when called up) ;
also the hundreds of thousands of p.n.’s given by
people of all sorts who had paid £5O and given
£450 worth of paper for a bit of land that later
was worth £25, the said paper being gravely in-
cluded by, the paper-banks among their “assets.’’
But that “currency,” if it could be called one, had
no legal recognition; it had no gold reserve behind
it; and it was good only among the members of
a clique in a single city and not very good
there. The trouble is that boom allotments
are a sort of currency in themselves. People
buy them in the hope of passing them on at
a profit, whereas people are content tft buy a £1
note and sell it at the same old price. There must
be some kind of profit made on unused land to keep
things going, for there are rates and taxes and other
charges all the time, while nobody has to pay rates
or a note or to drain it or fence it or have a road
built to it. And every time a magician draws some
lines on a plan, and inserts a big advertisement, and
thereby turns a plain eow-paddock into a flock of
desirable building sites, he inflates the currency. The
people who use this medium of exchange are not so
very many; even in boom-time the buyers of allot-
ments are a fraction. The possibilities of inflation
are unlimited —until, of course, the allotment-buyers
have to try to sell to each other. Meanwhile, seeing
that in some cases the big and profitable purehasp-
money is payable by instalments spread over 20
years, it seems as if some people must be paying
War-time Profits Tax on a lot of paper profits. And.
if people are compelled by law to take up Govern-
ment securities in proportion to their wealth, includ-
ing allotments and lOU’s given in payment for allot-
ments, it looks as if a heap of allotments may be
dumped on the counter of Denison Miller’s bank.

It is made up in miniature troughs to prevent wastage and to make for easy
and agreeable handling in the'fields. It is manufactured in Australia from High-
grade Salt with the true health-giving ingredients.
It is cheaper than rock-salt be-
cause there is no wastage, and the cost
of railage is a detail as compared with
the crude cumbersome article. It is
immenselysuperior to rock-salt because
it is the product of nature combined
with the skill and teaching of science
and experience.
The Manufacturers of Bondo
Salt LicKs claim without fear and
with the justification of experience that
theirarticle has no superior in the world.
It is cheaper because there are no
freight and export charges. It is better
because it is made in Australia by the
latest methods and machinery and by
skilled chemists and artisans.
Every storekeeper, saddler and
blacksmith should at once get in touch
with our agents to handle this universal
line. It is better, cheaper, and gives
larger profits.
No fewer than 700,000 cases of
Salt Licks were sold in Australia last
year. Are you getting in among these
profits P

Niedergang.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Weltmaeht oder Niedergang”—World-power or
downfall.— Bernhardt.
’Twas just four little years ago our banners
floated wide,
And “Deutschland fiber Alles” was our glory
and our pride.
We trampled Belgium underfoot, we set our
heel on France,
And deep in Servia’s bosom red we drove
the Pandour lance.
Poor Britain’s “hundred-thousand” band we
scattered to the wind,
And cared not half a Frankfurt then what
more might be behind.
A world of blood and agony, it cost us not
a pang—
For Us ’twas all Victoria—for others Nieder-
gang !
Our kultur rose triumphant o’er tower and
town and shrine.
We sucked the Belgium marrow dry, we
bathed in foreign wine ;
The slaughtered priest within the fane, the
violated nun,
Attested what a Power it was whose reign
had just begun ;
And when the Lusitania sank we scorned to
use a cloak,
But flagged Berlin and raised on high the
warlike German “Hoch !”
While league on league from peak to peak
the*soaring anthem rang:
“Our good old German Gott will bring our
foemen’s Niedergang!”
Oh, Teufel, cunning Teufel, was it a voice
of thine
That aped in impish mockery the lips of One
Divine ?
Was it the wiles of Death and Hell that
drove us to the brink
And made the abyss open wide and bade our
Deutschland sink?
’Twas i*Mre than earthly cunning sure that
drove the German, till
In frenzied fire and bloody lust his only word
was “Kill!”
That deafened him to what was clear above
the battle’s clang—
“ The world-power is the foeman’s now and
thine the Niedergang!”
Our props ap falling round us—the Bulgar
was the first
Of all our cozened Allies —he, the bloodiest
and the worst;
The Turk is hard behind him on desertion’s
dirty track
(Thrice lucky if they plant not both their
daggers in our back !).
And Austria falls to pieces like a thing of
sticks and straw,
And far and wide the hated Slav has raised
a hairy paw.
While north and south and east and west
is bared the gleaming fang,
And up from Hell the whisper comes: “It is
thy Niedergang!”
QUEENSLAND.
P. AIREY.
“Rowley Clark” : Constantinople has been
besieged 29 times since its foundation by the
Megarians in 658 b.c., under the name of
Byzantium. Of the numerous commanders
who have attacked the city, only eight have
captured it — Pausanias, 477 b.c. ; Alcibi-
ades, 410 b.c. ; Severus, a.d. 197 ; Constan-
tine the Great, a.d. 315; Alexius Com-
nenus, 1081: Dandolo, Michael Palceo-
logus, 1261. Mahomet 11. (The Con-
queror) in 1453 wrested the splendid posi-
tion from Constantine XII., who,- with the
Genoese commander, Giusttniant, put up
one of the finest defensive stoushes in his-
tory. The Unspeakable has done the limpet
act ever since. In fact, he will have to be
prised off. In 1770 the Empress Catherine
sent a large fleet the long way round through
the Strait of Gibraltar. Alexieff Orloff was
styled High Admiral of the Russian Fleet
in the Mediterranean. However, the real
tradesmen were English officers, chiefly
Admiral Elpiiinstone, Captain Gregg anil
Lieut. Dugdale. After smashing the Turk-
ish Fleet off Lemnos —“where the Anzacs
used to be”— Elpiiinstone proposed the in-
stant forcing of the Dardanelles and the
bombardment of Constantinople. Orloff
wavered. While he hesitated the Grand
Vizier and a French engineer—Baron De
Tott— rushed down to the Dardanelles. The
proceedings on the Vizier’s part were hilari-
ous. He whitewashed the walls of the ruined
forts, so that the Russians would think the
works, looking so clean and bright, were
new. De Tott got busy and erected four
batteries —two on each side of the Strait—
so as to place any aggressive vessel under a
cross fire. This energy settled Orloff and
was the foundation of the system that
stopped the Allied Fleet when it made the
same late run that Catherine’s friend did.
If late cables are correct, Billjim is going
to take charge of the Dardanelles; and
if there is a wet canteen on only one
side of the Narrows, Billjim will do the
Leander-Byron stunt in very large num-
bers. I know. I’ve seen him at Dekka.
“Tiny”: “0.L.” (B. 24/10/18) throws a
brick at the autocratic tiler who forced a
contractor to take off the battens laid by a
carpenter before he would do his job. Tiles,
even from the one kiln, vary in length, and
so require a different gauging of the battens,
which means a difference of up to liin.
between the shortest and longest tiles. A
mistake of (jin. will prevent a good job being
made, but the carpenter doesn't know enough
about tiles and their measurement to fluke a
correct job of battening every time. The
fact that the carpenter is a woodworker no
more qualifies him to put our battens on than
does the fact that we put battens on qualifies
us to cut, place and nail his rafters. Besides,
even if “Chips” has fluked the battening cor-
rectly, he has performed tiler’s work at less
than iaward rates, and so we have a round-
about way of enforcing our award. The tiler
loses on an average 12 hours out of 44 per
week, and gets all the rough stuff on the
housetops. Wish “0.L.” would come on the
roof for a while.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney had its most impressive Day—the'
In Memoriam for the dead —on the Agricul-
tural Grounds on Sunday, Nothing could
have been more admirably planned. There
was no confusion, and the crowd quietly
took part in one of the most historic gather-
ings that has ever been held in this old
town. In the official stand were Governor
Davidson and his lady, the Consuls—M.
Marcus, Vice-Consul for France; M. Wat-
teeuw, for Belgium; and M. Shimizu, for
Japan—were in their official duds. Nip-
pon’s representative wore his hat with a
black elastic band under the chin, the
breeze being apt to remove feathered milli-
nery and bonnet-pins were impracticable.
General Finn and his lady, with daughter
Kathleen, in the official half-mourning; the
Agricultural Society’s president, Sam Hor-
dern, and his wife; arid sec. 11. M.
Somer were in the crush. Captain
Lloyd, who wears the Military Cross on
his khaki, assisted in gently, leading dis-
tinguished persons to. their seats; Minister
David Ilall and his lady, and a few 1 lidding
admirals were on hand. Ori the, platform in
the show-ring. Archbishop Wright in his best
purple velvet hat and lingerie. Rabbi
Cohen, the Methody chief (I)iv Carruthers),
big John Ferguson from the kirk in Phillip-
street, heads of the Salvation Army, and a
Congregational parteon or two joined in the
memorial service tp our gajllaiit dead. All
around on the velvet turf were camped re-
turned Aussies.' The pulse of the ifiultitude
throbbed wlren- Chopin’s- Funeral March,
magnificently played by a, military band,
brought a mist of tears to.eyes not prone to
weeping. Then came the end —a trumpeter
sounding “The Last Post”
Surgeon-General Neville Ilowse, V.C.,
K.C.8., will be able as an expert to say just
where North Head fails as a quarantine
station. He was included in the Sononia’s
just free little list that was fumigated for
the eradication of influenza germs. Brig.-
General T. Griffiths and Major C. .T. God-
dard, both D.S.Q., Were' in the slop’s com-
plement.
The late Dr. Metcalfe, whose two sons
have been killed at the war, was for years at
Norfolk Island, and. married a handsome girl
who_ belonged to one of the indigenous
families long resident there. Mrs. Metcalfe’s
second son, killed a few months ago in
France, was that surgeon-major who won the
M.C. for bravery, and had been recommended
for the D.S.O. for liis gallantry in attending
to the wounded under heavy fire. At this
noble post of duty,, James Beverley Metcalfe
was killed. The other brother was also a
former Sydney ’Varsity man.
The Yankee boy who said he’d be mad
enough to lick .10 Germans if the authori-
ties gave him beans every day as a ration,
can be seen taking his dose in “Pershing’s
Crusaders,” at the Town Hall. The big film
brought all the Consuls out of their pigeon-
holes—or wherever good Consuls hide in the
day time—on Saturday night. Amongst
those lured to the show, the most beaming
countenance,. oerhaps. was owned by H.S.
Consul-General Brittain. He wore the genu-
ine victory smile when the “Star-spangled
Banner” was blown from the orchestra.
Rose Cumming, one of a trio of beauti-
ful sisters, well known here, is now in
Wanamaker’s (New York) as a deco-
rator. So successful has the venture proved
that she has sent for mother to join her.
The money raised for Italy’s Day now
totals £65,000. Yet the movement didn’t
get quite so easy a start as some others.
Centennial Park, set in leafy garlands of
trees, enclosed a big Y.A.D. outing on Satur-
day afternoon. Masses of white pinnies
with the Red Cross at the breast marched
and counter-marched on a green flat like
a field of snow-white mushrooms on the
move. There was scarcely a face, for all
the smart starched hat that shaded it, which
didn t show the strain of the long war years
of work for Billjim. These women, many of
them slips of girls, have scrubbed floors,
washed clothes (heavy washing of men’s
wear) and cleaned enouvh plates and cut-

form a ladder up to the Pearly Gates.
Lady Davidson inspected the cap-and-apron
army—about 2000 strong—while Dr. Roth
colonel in The A.M.C. and generalissimo or
something equally exalted of the N. S. Wales
Y.A.D.. made the necessary explanations.
Mrs. Gordon Wesche, in the new bluish-grey
Red Cross uniform (there are large white
cliffs and collars to the drapery), as director
of the Aids, was in the official compound.
The Red Cross Executive buzzed in front
seats, where Mrs. Alfred Lee, Mrs. John
Toehey, Stanham, A.D.C., with a small
Davidson clinging to his cuffs, and Speaker
Cphen and his missus, proud of a son just
home from the war, were entrenched.
Ethel G. Ilely, of the Soldiers and Citi-
zens’ organisation, goes to the western side
of the State this week to preach the S. and C.
gospel, which lias its foundation upon Bill-
jiln’s love of country and carelessness of
self. Miss Ilely (recently of Toowoomba,
by the way) ought to have the spirit of the
gospel within her. She comes of N. S.
Wales pioneering stock, and has as near rela-
tives the Gother Mann clan. Grandpa was
Frederick Augustus Ilely, of Wyoming, an
early “controller” of convicts whose humane
instincts softened somewhat a deplorable
business.
After nearly four years absence, pianist
Laurence Godfrey Smith is home intact
from the- war. His wounds —on the head —
have healed, and the long trip hack to Aus-
trafia. with a loiter
by Canadian lakes,
has restored liis
health. “Gained two
stone on the jour-
ney,” he says. In
rank he is a lieuten-
ant in the British
Royals Field Artil-
lery in Australia
on furlough. Much
of the furlough was.
eaten up by the
journey. Peace has
come with such a
sudden and stupen-
dous victory that the
Sydney man admits
he can hardly real-
ise it. “In July the
Allies were threatened
with catastrophe. The tide began ,to turn on
July IS—my mother’s birthday, by the way.”
The accomplished musician was making £llOO
a year, possibly a record as a private
teacher, when he enlisted. After working
in the Censor’s office for a while in London
lie joined the British army at Is. 2d. a day.
Eventually he gained a lieutenant’s com-
mission in the R.F.A. at Bs. 6d. a day.
Technically, he should at his own cost, re-
turn to England to sign off, but he’s earn-
estly looking for an official loophole that
will permit his discharge at this end. The
pliqto ’..as taken since his return by May
Moore.
In spite of the great emancipation, prison-
ers of war to be released from lluu camps
will need all their womenkind can do for
them during the next few months. The N. S.
Wales fund for their benefit is likely to con-
tinue its operations till the sufferers —some
of . them from hideous brutality—are clothed,
comforted and restored to health. At the Cairo
(Potts Point) the other evening the prison-
ers-of-war entertainment was a great success.
There was a hop in the big drawing-room
and a cafe chant ant elsewhere. Bridge, illu-
minated grounds and a military band were

If you are of the she persuasion and want to go
home to Australia nowadays you must interview
pretty Mrs. Gillies about it, for she is the goddess
of Repatriation at Australia House, , Andy Fisher’s
mortgaged palace. Before she married her soldier-
hqsband— killed, alas, a year ago —she .was Leah
Halenburg, of Melbourne! you remember, one of the
Repertory Theatre’s early .players.. Now. she is in
charge of the interviewing • section of the Repatria-
tion Department for all Billjim’s feminine relations,
a job needing plenty of tact and diplomacy, to say
nothing of a sense of humor;
Now, take a long breath and then read this,
which was brought me by a decrepit postman this
morning:—
“A marriage has been arranged between Mr.
Claude Marion Percv de La Roche-Francis, of New
York City, United 'States of America (son of the
late Mr. Valentine Mott Francis, of New V ork City
and of Newport, Rhode Island, and of his wife,
Anna de Serre de La Roche, and nephew, adopted
son, and heir of the late Charles Percy Edward Rene
Felix, 9th Marquis de La Roche-sur-Y illaine, 11th
Count de Serre and 14th Baron de La Carelle in the
Peerage of France, Baron de Natial in the French
colony of the island of San Domingo, Count Palatine
of the Lateran Hall and Apostolic Palace of the
Vatican, Count of the Holy Roman Empire in
Austria, Grandee of Spain of the First Class, Pri-
vate" Chamberlain and Extra-Groom of the Privy
Chamber of the Sword and Cap to his Holiness
the late Pope Leo XIII. and to his Holiness the
late' Pope Pius X., and of his wife, Mary Agnes
Francis dc Sales Williams Stokes, Marquise de La
Roche-sur-Villaine, Countess de Serre and Baroness
de Nadal and de La Carelle, daughter of the late
Mr. William Axon Stokes, of Philadelphia, Pennsyl-
vania, and Mrs. Weir Jamieson (Mathilde Greely
Clifford), widow of Mr. Weir Jamieson, or Carlisle
Cumberland, and daughter of the late Mr. V illiani
Henrv Clifford, of Washington, in the District of
Columbia, and of his wife Ellen Greely. Brown, of
Bram Hall, Portland, Maine.”
And the only name I recognised on the roster was
Brown! And then I wasn’t sure if it was the
particular Brown 1 knew or just any old Brown.
A journalist abroad sends some interesting
chips, from the old European block: “Paris,
in September, is chiefly a city of sandbags
and American officers. The dear little Paris
lady continues to take' a most praiseworthy
interest in her appearance, for the benefit, I
suppose, of the sandbags. These —there must
be millions of them —are piled up against
precious buildings and surround priceless
memorials. Not only pictures, but in some
cases windows (what marvels they are!)
have been stored in vaults.... Refugee dug-
outs are almost in the very heart of the city;
....But it is the poor little French villages
for which one grieves—villages where the
peasant farmers lived with their butcheries
and their bakeries (even war-bread in France
is deliciously made), and their inevitable
cafe and equally inevitable little church. Not
one brick stands upon another in hundreds
of these villages, because the. mason-work has
been blasted to powder. The fields /have been
torn to pieces, and the whole countryside is
pitted with holes. They .call them holes
when you could merely bury a horse in them.
Anything big enough to swallow a herd of
elephants is.a ‘crater.’ Where Pozieres used
to be the Craters are something extra.”
Returned disabled soldiers are learning-
pottery in all its branches at the Technical
College. Their
teacher, Mrs. Sam
Dawson (photo by
Judith Fletcher), is
perhaps better quali-
fied to teach them
than any woman in
Sydney, As a child
of nine in Hanley,
S taffordshire
(Eng.), she spent
alternate days at
school and in iron-
stone works. “Good
masters,” she says,
“they were, and I
spent 11 years in
their employ.” Of her
six stalwart soldier
sons two have died for
their ideals. All were in the A.I.F. “Mum”
Dawson, as the returned men call their
teacher '(she mothers the lot) began work as
a kiddy in England—that island that has to
wake up—at Is', a week.’ There was a half-
penny pocket-money every Saturday, which
she tossed, for luck, in her pinnie. And in
that little pinnie—“we all wore them in
those , days”—Mum Dawson had heart-rend-
ing troubles. She is a potter by in-
stinct. ' “I believe,” she said, “Australia
has the finest clay in the world, but it’s very
hard to make Australians, think so. If I had
the' capital I would start pottery works
to-morrow; and get a fortune out of it.” At
the age of eleven she took 2s. 6d. a week
home to mother. At 16 she was the fourth
woman “jollier” in England. The “jolly”
was a new machine when young Stafford-
shire jumped to work at 6 a.m., and the jol-
lier (the name fits her like a glove) who
smiles. in this picture is, by the way, the
mother of the gallant Australian corporal
who swam the Jordan on March 22 on a
“stunt” and was awarded the M.M.
After unprecedented beating of tin-cans,
waving of flags and general delirium over
the glad tidings from Europe, Sydney put
on its best togs and collected itself last
week into, the Domain for a Thanksgiving
service. The crowd gained impetus from
the pressure that began somewhere near
Bourke’s statue at the Domain’s upper en-
trance, and a vast sea of human faces surged
forward. There was no disorder, only the
passionate desire of 250,000 or so to see
and hear the service, but there was also no
plan for giving the returned soldiers, par-
ticularly the barely convalescent, who were
too weak to stand against the rush, a separ-
ate enclosure. The police, stationed at
intervals round a big circle on the sward,
soon became, like the equator, an imaginary
line. Mounted troopers wei’e swallowed up
in the human tidal-wave. One light barri-
cade, from the official stand to the place
where the sub-regal party left its cars, held
against the pressure all the afternoon.
Similar light divisional fencing would have
given the army nurses, the Y.A.D. (only a
small lot, this, mostly from the Drummoyne
detachment) and the returned men reason-
able comfort and space. As it was. in the
chaotic conditions, some of the Y.A.D. girls
and sick soldiers with blue bands to ensure
special care, hung like flies on the flimsy
stand-railing. Premier Holman made a few-
peaceful remarks. Ilis Ex., in cocked hat
and Windsor uniform, followed suit. Chief
Secretary Fuller and his tall lady were in
the. forefront. Brig.-General Jobson, as a
returned man, had a comfortable seat by
the vice-regal ear. General Lee, the Con-
suls in all their glory, and a small herd of
chaplains were squashed on a platform
several sizes too small for the invited party.
Of the sky-pilots who tried to address the
vast multitude Chaplain Mackenzie, M.C.,
got the most tumultuous welcome. The
band, which was dismembered in the crowd,
could only support the singing in fitful
gusts. Still, though no one seemed to be in
charge of the general arrangements, casual-
ties didn’t amount to anything worse than
a few fainting ]§eace-makers.
At the Mary-Elizabeth tea-house (lent free)
Y.A.D. girls assisted the other evening when
a party was held in aid of Furlough House.
That’s the sea-breezy holiday home near Dee
Why, which will open its front door shortly
for the wives and kiddies of soldiers.
About a hundred or so returned men of the
Ist Field Artillery were the guests of the girl-
workers of the evening branch of the Ist F. A.
Comforts Depdt, under the guidance of Mrs.
Agnes King (her son is in command of a
F.A. Brigade). Oxford Ilall was the loca-
tion. Le M. Walker, of the War Chest, put
in a word for bis Day on the 29th, and inci-
dentally displayed to the audience an inter-
esting gift of a case of scarlet cherries, an
“A” for Anzac worked in the paler variety,
grown by ex-Gunner Barnard on his orchard
at the Invere'll soldier settlement.
Violinist Lionel \ Lawson, who passed
through the Richmond Aviation School a
while back, was at date of last mail acquir-
ing the finishing touches of an aviator In
Cairo. In between liis working hours he
fiddles a lot for patriotic shows. Also in
Cairo, singing to Billjim, is May Brookes,
sister of Reel Cross Commissioner Norman
Brookes, of tennis fame.
Sydney society is frequently drawn to
the stage for its leaders, and the teacups
are agitated just now by news from the un-
reliable busybody, Mrs. Rumor, that a well-
preserved widower is offering the plati-
num and diamond circlet to a little blonde
showing in vaudeville on the Mclntosh cir-
cuit. She’s gdt a handy name for rhyming,
should the best man want to write a poem
to her.
Suicide of Money Lake in a Woollahra
flat recalls that his wife was Ida Gill, of
brief stage fame. She is the daughter of a
Victorian pastoralist. and took to the foot-
lights for the fun of it.
A charming Cremorne girl, one of the
S'toekfords, has been honeymooning at the
Wentworth with hubby “Bobby” Deane, who
served in Egypt and France.
The Army Service Corps’ workers will
have .a two days’ of feminine undies and
children’s wear in Perdriau’s shop, George-
street. The dates are November 19 and 20.
Proceeds will be halved between Jack’s Day
and the War Chest effort on November 29.

The Armadale Cup drew a big crowd to
Caulfield on Saturday. The women were out
in muslins and chiffons to enjoy the after-
noon sunshine. The enjoyment didn’t last
long. A change of wind brought drenching
rain and the stand was crowded with shiver-
ing females. One butterfly in muslin wore
a bell topper made of stiff tulle. After the
first shower it was only fit for a burlesque
show. The Monasli dame was out in green
and blue flimsies. She is eagerly awaiting
a cable from her General inviting her to
England. Mrs. Knight appeared in black.
Mrs. Curran, from Hobart, was present
with daughter I’auline, who was among the
muslin brigade. Mrs. Cooper wore fawn
tailorings and a straw hat something like
a Fijian wool thatch.
An impressive crowd ranged itself on the
high grey steps of Federal Parliament House
last Wednesday to hear the G.-G. read the l
official message about the end of poor old
Frightfulness. Round some chairs (nicely
padded chairs) destined for the Ministers was
an imposing circle. The Ministers came down
the steps and arranged their vests and col-
lars for the benefit of the movie operators.
The G.-G. came up the steps from his car.
He was tricked out with gorgeous clothes
and befeathered hat, and his footsteps were'
solemnly dogged by a suite of great magni-
ficence. (Understand, this is no second-hand
country ! Everything is right up to the best
style of Andy Fisher’s palace in London,
where the King and Billy Hughes ruffle it.)
Lady Helen, in powder-blue and filmy black,
was extracted (like the conjurer’s lady)
from the dense crowd.
Lady Helen, who is head of the Friendly
Union of Soldiers’ Wives and Mothers and
is always anxious to entertain thein, last
Friday accepted an invitation from the
Wirths to a special matinee. She, Mrs.
Pearce and Mrs. Sellheim took hundreds of
women and kiddies along. Mrs. Wirth, a
neatly-tailored figure, received her Ex., who,
from the arena, thanked the staff for their
kindness. Philip Wirth replied that the
pleasure was theirs.
Sister Greer, one of our sterling Bush
Nurses, lately told a Melbourne audience
something about the dwellers on the high
Monaro tableland, beyond Dargo, where they
can build a 12-roomcd house from the timber
of one tree. Yet thousands of these giants
are destroyed every year merely to get them
out of the way of the men who want to use
the land. The tree may be worth up to
£5O, but it is 50 miles from a railway, so
the firestick goes in. And when the land is
cleared, what then? Sister Greer showed
photos of giant maize that looked like scrub,
and of four youngsters rowing on the Snowy
River in a boat made of half a pumpkin!
Now that the crisis is past it is a subject
for jocular comment, but for a time it caused
consternation in the Highest Quarters. It
appears that on the afternoon preceding the
evening on which some important personages
were to have a snack with a Governor the
butler took a warm bath, in preparation for
the solemn rites that were to follow, and,
with that lack of consideration peculiar to
servants even in the Very Best houses, per-
mitted himself to collapse. When it was
learned that the great food-usher would not
be able to ush. that night, blank dismay
descended upon the household. It was then
that one of the gentlemen aides showed what
he was made of by stepping into the breach
and taking charge of the leaderless servants.
His buttling was so like the real thing that
it was not until the harrowing story leaked
out afterwards that the guests realised how
near the dinner-party had been to the brink
of disaster. And yet the vulgar Labor party
says that genthelps to Governors are a waste
of money! :
The new Victorian Red Cross executive
consists of Mrs. Orme Masson and six men
—John Grice, Howard Berry, William
Williamson, Charles Gray, of the Trades
Hall, Solicitor-General Arthur Robinson
and Gaud-Mayor Cabena. The society will
probably be toiling long after the last of the
Hun guns have been spiked. A recent order
received by the Australian council was for
5000 pyjama suits per month until the last
of the wounded are returned. That means a
lot of work, but is only a detail of the labors
which the society still sees ahead of it.
Jimmy Smeal, who put in a short term as
medical superintendent of the Melbourne
Hospital when doctors began to be scarce
after the war started, went off with an
A-I.F. field ambulance on thg completion of
his local job. Now he is back in Melbourne,
having in the meantime gained his majority
and seen well over three years' service.
A hard-doing camelero went West when
Jack Farrell, of Melton (Vic.), died of
fever at Damascus last month. Farrell, a
son of John Farrell of Melton Park, served
with the Camel Corps during the most
strenuous portion of its career, and was
afterwards with the Light Horse.
"What purported to be a reunion of Port-
land pioneers was held the other evening in
Melbourne, with John Maddock in the chair.
It was a fairly new crop of pioneers, of
course, all the Portlanders who really
earned the title having been under the sod
these many years ; but the assemblage was a
highly affable and hearty-eating one, and
aired many quaint and lively reminiscences
of the life it had lived in the ancient village.
Benjamin Hoare proposed the toast of “The
Pioneers.” His own personal connection
with Portland is somewhat obscure, but the
mellow old piessman made up for his defici-
encies as a pioneer by weaving a handsome
garland of speech to the memory of the
men who adventured across Bass Strait in
the early thirties of last century.
Young Percy Chirnside had a round of race
season frivols in Melbourne before starting
back to join his English regiment. His two-
step gathering at Toorak Towers was a
noisy affair, which shook the hashhouse and
made the non-dancing boarders groan. As
a final sprint the rejoicing hussar enter-
tained a week-end party at his father’s Wer-
ribee house, with a gymkhana as the star
attraction.
Major George Grantham Anderson,
R.A.ni.C., was a great figure at Melbourne
University a decade ago. A good oar, foot-
baller, cricketer and runner, he was one of the
most popular sports to pass through Ormond
College. This week brings news of his death
at Etaples, France. His wife was Eileen
Shields.
Young Lieutenant Lindsay Doubleday, of
the Dental Corps, died at sea when a
few weeks out from Melbourne on his way
to France. He enlisted while a student, re-
mained to finish his course, and was called
up a few months ago.
Gunner Fred Stein, son of the late Super-
intendent Stein, head of Melbourne Fire
Brigade before Lee, went down to influenza
in France this week. His mother recently
arrived in England, intending to make a
home there.
Mrs. Stewart, widow of general-manager
Stewart, of the Bank of Victoria, has opened
a florist’s shop in South Yarra. The name
on the window is “Blanche.” The lady
opened the business by tastefully decorating
for the big dinner-party of 50 medicoes at the
Oriental in honor of Dunbar Hooper’s re-
turn from the war.
Miss ‘ Henty, one
of the Victorian
pioneering family,
has been one of the
busiest women in
Melbourne for
months. She has
been looking after
the desnatch of
plum-puddings, bil-
lies, gum-leaves ahd
Christmas cakes to
the boys in France.
Where the soldiers
will eat their Christ-
mas dinner is now
quite unknown;
Some of thi*m may
enjoy the' dainties
on homeward-bound'
transports or during
leave in England, or even in Germany. Any-
how Miss Henty devotedly plays Mother
Christmas to ' the Aussies, wherever they
may be.
Adelaide’s report:—
On Saturday the members of the French Mission
were bidden to morning tea at the South Australian
Hotel by the Alliance Francaise, where the Galway
lady welcomed them. In the afternoon the visitors
were motored through the hills, halting first at
the Langdon Bonython home at the top of the
mount to enthuse over the view and have afternoon
tea, and then going on to the E. 0. Stirlings’ to
admire one of this State’s most picturesque gardens.
On Tuesday evening white-clad women, wearing
the badges of their respective associations, filled
every seat in the Exhibition and overflowed into
the annexes on either side. The meeting had been
arranged so that the women of the State might
send, through General Pan, a message to the women
of France. The whole place was a-flutter with flags and
streamers of red, white and blue, and the old General
was obviously touched by the tremendous reception
he got; Hundreds of the women present were the
next-of-kin of men who have fallen, and nothing
could have appealed to them more than the General's
announcement of his wish, on his return to France,
to organise means whereby the graves of Aus-
tralians who have been killed in France can be
located and cared for.
The South Aus. Soldiers’ Fund has collected
£98,000 towards the £120,000 required to
launch its insurance scheme for the widows and
orphans of soldiers. During the last six months it
has distributed £21,000 to soldiers and their
dependants at an administrative cost of about
£l2OO.
The Galway lady spends this week-end at Linl-
say Park as the guest of the C. H. Angases. She
will open the Angaston Red Cross Fete on Saturday.
The 21st show of the S.A. Society of Arts is now
on, and has attracted 75 artists, of whom a fair
proportion are from N. S. Wales and Vic. Purchases
for Adelaide Gallery are the main incentive. The Trus-
tees’ buyings this year are few so far—a fan painted
on silk by Florence Mofflin, of Sydney, and “The
Apotheosis of Villon,’’ by Norman Lindsay. James
Jackson, of Sydney, is the most striking of the
newcomers with strong figure compositions.
Major Wilfrid R. Snow, of the Royal Flying Corps,
arrived in Sydney this week, carrying with him
several decorations. The Major, as a quiet young
man in the Sydney office of his father, Francis 11.
Snow, of Adelaide, pushed off to London when war
broke out, and joined the air force. He had over
three years at the game. Apart from feeling pretty
sorry for himself while in quarantine on the Sonoma,
he is kicking himself for having secured furlough
just before Fritz crashed.
A son of Martin Hocking, sporting editor of Adtd-
aide Advertises, was in a cadet school in England,
with a commission looming ahead when the mail
left. Awhile ago he was given a M.M. for plucky
conduct in France.
Amongst youngsters wounded at Peronne was Gunner
David Evans, a son of Dr. Evans, of Adelaide, and
one of the many old “Saints” who have been serving
hot cockles to Fritz. He was a stretcher-bearer —
one of a group of “Saints” gathered together by the
popular Dr. Goldsmith for his field ambulance —but
after being wounded, two years ago, he exchanged
into the artillery. At latest, he was in hospital at
Bristol, with orders to lie still for some time to
come.
Abe Shannon, Adelaide’s luxurious bachelor, who
recently arrived in England after being turned
down by the military authorities umpteen times, got
into khaki at last. He has been taken on—or over —
by the Australian Red Cross, and has gone to France
to see what he can do for Billjim.
Stuart Woods, M.C., of Walkerville (S.A.), who
is a lieutenant in the Australian Imperial Forces,
has given a ring to an English lassie, Miss Irene
Wright, whose parents live at Chiswick.
Lieut. Daly, son of the late merchant
Daly, is engaged to Edith Ilarrhy, an Eng-
lish girl who visited Australia with violiniste
Mary Law in 1015. The bridegroom-elect
was severely wounded in May of this year,
but returned to the Front in September.
E. Hilda Jtix Nicholas, who hangs a quan-
tity of her pictures at the Guildhall, is a
highly-competent artist; but the colossal
triptych which adorns a whole wall of her
exhibition is a mistake. “Pro Ilumanitate”
elaborates in three large canvases her own
grief and desolation at the loss of her soldier
husband in France. Probably she felt too
intensely to naint well. Elsewhere when she
paints for visual gratification the achieve-
ment of form and color is the whole of her
ambition. Color to her is especially a rap-
ture, and one finds her turning to the bril-
liancies of fancy-dress, the red flowers and
laces of Spanish dancers, even the incendiary
tresses of a damsel in buttercup, with an
enthusiasm trained to ecstasy by a French
education. Yet though her love of color is
almost Oriental, it is at the service of a
talent more sophisticated and charming than
any other of the same sex in Australia at
present. It is impossible to deny the qual-
ity of some things like “Grandm&re” and “A
Mother of France,” even though there is an
occasional weightiness of treatment that
gives British - solidity to the divinest sylph.
But?-.her drawings in colored crayons seem
preferable to 1 any of her performances t in
oils. Here her hand is wholly French and
her color a frolic. Bedouins and dancing-
girls, all the flaming and varied life of
Tetuan and Tangiers, bits of Spain, Holland
and old French markets have been thrown
vividly on to paper by a pencil that never
misses a salient fact in a picture. Also she
has employed her Conti crayon in portraits,
finding much profit in profiles, by the way,
and there are so'me of these, particularly
“The Flapper” (No. 54) and “Lorna” (No.

not forget in a hurry.
In the Women’s Art Club show at the
Athenaeum several well-meaning ladies put
up a desperate struggle for the booby prize.
It would be sheer cruelty to mention
them by name. Only a comparatively
competent minority has contributed anything
worth while to the show. The gem of the
collection is Mrs. Rix Nicholas’s “Pink
Scarf,” which, in its sound painting and
seductive coloring, serves to cast her neigh-
bors’ efforts further back into the pot-boiler
class. Marion Jones Is responsible for one
or two pastels that are fresh and pleasing.
“The Ebb Tide,” from the brush of M. \\ .
Sherwood, demonstrates a happy facility
with water-colors, whilst some feeling and
brightness can be detected in a set of
weather impressions by A. E. Perry. Also
the miniaturist, Mrs. Maclellan, is_ attrac-
tive, and the china painters, Mrs. Saunders,
Miss Grist and Miss Tompkins, display a
greater recognition of the decorative quali-
ties of flowers than their numerous and unin-
spired sisters, who systematically libel the
blooms on canvas.
Mrs. Rowan, painter of wild flowers, has
just returned to Melbourne with a superb
collection of paintings of Australian tropical
birds and flowers. Her particular novelties
are the birds of paradise, kingfishers, very
large pigeons, swifts, honey-suckers, bower-
birds and some resplendent fish.
Leila Doubleday and her violin returned
to town and the Auditorium platform on
Saturday night. Unfortunately a drenching
rain spoilt the prospects of the "box-office. She
is staying with the W. L. Baillieus, and the
clan came to the concert in force. Leila
took the platform in a quiet little oyster-grey
gown.
Eighty thousand

good few years
since Sister Thomas
was first placed in

Hospital. In fact,
she has been there
so long that half the
populace regard her
as their own special

To brighten the lot of children of the

Now that the U-boats are out of business

Beatrice and the babies.
The Baby Welfare Council has been urging
the State Government to pay more attention
to the metropolitan milk supply. Live pigs
and loaded cream-cans are alleged to have
been carried together by the Railway Depart-
ment, and full milk-cans shoved into vans
with mucky floors. The Baby Council has
mentioned these muck-and-milk disclosures
in its appeal, asking the Government to “take
immediate action,” and the Lawson Cabinet
is understood to be looking into the matter.
That means, of course, that a bunch of re-
ports will presently be available, in wdiich
various parties will explain away everything
but the germs by showing that the pigs were
in a hurry, and that the cream would have
gone bad if it had been left till next morn-
ing. There’s a chance for the Railway Com-
missioners to inaugurate a new system of
quick-fire orders. For instance: “Be sani-
tary or be sacked I” “Don’t mix pigs and
milk !” “Don’t report—clean up !”

Only a miracle side-tracked a sickening
tragedy at Warwick Farm (Sydney) on Saturday,
when half the horses in a field of 18 rolled over m
a heap. It happened during the running of the Farm
Stakes. The first racer to go down was Chlorelume,
ridden by Sieley, and most of those behind piled
over her. Donna Mona, a five-year-old mare by
Poseidon —Cremona, piloted by an apprentice named
Whatmough, got the worst of the sma: h. The lad
lived only an hour or so; the mare had to be put
out of misery. How the others escaped death is a
conundrum. They all came a. fearful cropper. Of
course, there will be an inquiry into tin' cause ot
the accident, but this page will lay long odds that
no one will think it worth while to inquire whether
the loss of a youngster’s life at a “race-mcit mg” on a
suburban course is counterbalanced by any “encour-
agement given to the breeding industry’ thereon.
The quality of the horses running at this meeting,
the tinpot prize-money handed out, and the charac-
ter of the proceedings generally give to the death of
young Whatmough an exceptionally tragic, aspect.
The Fortune Hunter is a really good
horse, but he came late in life, in a racing way of
speaking. His full-brother. Gold Hush, may also be
waiting to mature, but his effort in running third
among the maidens at Warwick Farm on Saturday
seemed to suggest that he won’t be quite as good
as his relative for a few years yet.
* * * *
There was a yarn the other day that Bar-
ney Allen had turned down an offer of 6000 guineas
for the Maribyrnong Plate winner, Gambler’s Gold.
It looks a lot of money to offer and refuse, but
whether the figures lie correct or not it is probably
true that there was, an offer of something mighty
substantial. And in view of some not very remote
purchases and rumors of proffered hatsful for certain
nags, Gambler’s Gold is just the sort of nag to
attract attention. The colt has given a great lift to
bis sire, Pahowtan, a Gallinule horse —for which
breeders had, for some unaccountable reason, shown
very little enthusiasm —and a big advt. to Allen’s
stud. Yet buying on a winning performance often
seems a more riskv business than acquiring a year-
ling. Just look over the list of early-comers which
quickly went to the pack, and recollect some of the
wads that have been exchanged for quadrupeds dur-
ing the last two or three years! About £15,000
was paid for five horses last year, of which only one
has since won a race, though at least four of them
were solidly backed more than once. Incidentally,
it may be remarked that at the sale ring last year
the best bid for Gambler’s Gold was 200 guineas.

.Tack Nicolson, an old-time Victorian
trainer, weighed out the other day at Bendigo. For
over half a century he had been attending to horses.
He was head man for John Dowie in Smvarrow’s
time, and later for Joe Morrison, at Flemington,
in the days of Commotion. Among the best-
remembered horses he turned out when training on
his own account was Dunlop, the Melbourne Cup
winner of ’79. He was a brother of Donald Nicol-
son, killed in the smash in Grace Darling’s Caulfield
C "P’ ,
Dead at 64, Francis Foy, who for many
years beguiled the monotony of being one of Sydney’s
leading rag merchants with owning horses. Some
were good and some were the other sort. He had
a passion for foreign horses, and up to a year or
two ago few had imported more than he. The two
best he ever had were Playaway (by Carbine), win-
ner of the Caulfield Futurity and Newmarket; and
Lord Ullin’s Daughter, who won the Australian Cup
and later became the dam of Ulva’s Isle. Inci-
dentally, it took a lot to induce Foy to send the
two nags down to Melbourne that year. Another
good one was Voyou, second to Merriwee in the
Melbourne Cup. Latterly the Foy colors had not
been too frequently noticed in the right place. The
Christian Brother carried them most frequently, and
that calamitous moke is certainly no champion.

“Roller” : It is not a bit of use “Spreader”
(B. 14/Tl/’18) grunting that feeding to selected
strains is “no way of arriving at individual excel-
lence.” By doing that he weakens his own argu-
ment, for whatever criticism may be advanced against
breeding to paper there is no possible justification
for such an allegation as this. Such breeding is
a way of arriving at individual excellence, and
arrives there very frequently, as the records of
every season show. The trouble seems to he that
breeders go to' a great extent on the blind. This
is in consequence, no doubt, of the system they
work being imperfectly understood, of a quasi-
seientific method being used in an empirical way.
This, in turn, is because the majority of men iden-
tified with horse have a rather limited mental
equipment, or else are in the habit of treating the
problems of breeding as a side-line, as matters to
which they need give only, the fag-end of their
minds. An owner who selects a sire for a mare on
a theory about pedigrees alone is an obvious and
unanimous william-goat. But provided the mare
is true to her pedigree type—that is, if the pre-
potent strains in the ancestry are there —and the
stallion is true to his type, then the chances inci-
dental to mating on approved lines are much greater
than if the blood was mixed some other way. Of
this there is no doubt. It is only another way of
saying that whether an owner breeds to fixed
strains or goes on ideas about “correcting'’ defects
or weaknesses intelligence is the first necessity. Of
course, the whole business of breeding for pace is
clouded in mystery; but until the treatment of
the young Australian horse is distinguished by a
greater sanity, and the handling of young stallions
in the training stables undergoes great change,
neither a system of breeding nor the exercise of com-
monsense liy individuals in selection will get half a
chance. When most of the stock is butchered there
is not much point in judging the preliminary pro-
ceedings on the annual remnants.

“Trot”: Talking about betting systems
mentioned by “Mujik” (B. 14/11/’18) the proposi-
tion of taking the odds against a double stake on
successive favorites could only have one ending—
the bankruptcy of the long-eared punter who gave
it a trial. The main defect in it as a system is
that it isn’t a system, only an imitation thereof.
In games of the Monte Carlo order, even entertain-
ment like hazards, it is possible to apply a system
based on some particular aspect of the law of aver-
ages. In these you are dealing with inanimate
things and the law of average can be fairly closely
determined, though, of course, it is capsized by
the rule, or whatever it is, of luck. In hazards
for instance there is no such thing as “play.” A
rabbit-oh can throw half a dozen successive mains
as often as an astronomer. But in racing you
are not dealing with averages or bits of wood or
ivory moving in fixed ways. Brains, observation,
instinct, judgment—call it what you like, come in
and count heavily. Probably judgment nowhere
counts for so much as on a racecourse. Wherefore
before a betting system that is a system can be
worked the first thing to do is to systematise the
work the system only upon the verdict
given by a. cool mind upon the preliminary facts.
Backing favorites or second favorites or sticking to
any hard and fast rule is merely going on the
blind; but a good judge who stuck only to his
choice and backed nags only on the day—well, he
wouldn’t be a good judge if he couldn’t get more
than even by making any win he had double his
previous losses. This wouldn’t mean doubling his
stake, but calculating his stake on the odds, which
is something very different. The difficulty about
working on these'lines is that the man who backs
horses couldn’t refrain from playing up his luck
when it was in or from taking gambling chances
or from allowing sentiment and tips and his invari-
able cocksureness to operate. There is only one
possible system for him to win with, and that is to
stay at home and grow cabbages.

“Spreader”: In 11 out of 12 “races” at
Kensington (Svdnev) pony course on Saturday the
straight-out tote paid better prices than Ike. The
latter’s terms to clients in the first division of the
3 4.1 were more liberal by a whole half point,.
Twenty shillings on each winner with the hooks
showed a profit of £57 15s. ; on the “chaff-cutter’
a profit of £B3 12s. Had the joint been at work
in the Leger these figures would undoubtedly have
improved the position for machine bettors. That
there were no false prices on the s.o. was shown by
the evenness of the investments. On the place-
tote the 24 backers of first and second favorites all
showed a profit of sbme sort, as did nine out ot
the dozen whose nags lobbed home in third place.
The s.o. tote will solve the problem if it is ever
given a fair run.
To which this page mildly inquires— what pro-
blem? The main problem at present is to find out
exactly wliat the Government is up to with the
tote. What its object'd* ? If the idea is to regard
the machine solely as an instrument for acquiring
State revenue the next thing for the Ministry to do
can easily be explained. It should at once resume
all the courses within the Metropolitan area and
let them out for afternoon and evening occupation
by racing clubs, of which it is likely 748 could be
formed in a week or two. Then with plentiful
opportunities for relaxation and a rigid suppression
of competition from other gambling directions the
revenue would rush upwards with a whiz. If the
Ministry is not looking at the machine as a mechani-
cal tax-payer or as a contraption through which
racing, which is a gross offence to the turf and to
the name of sport, may be levied upon by the
Treasury for a share of the plunder, its presence on
a course like Kensington is a mystery. Whatever
may be done with the s.o. tote or any other undei
the auspices of a.pony proprietary doesnt give it
a fair run, because the thing has no moral or otbei
right to be there. The only problem to be solved
in sueli a case is how strong a pull a pony course
proprietary has over the Government. These clubs
are a problem in themselves, and a Ministry that
had even a reasonable grasp of the case for the
totalisator would not tolerate its use liy agencies
of the kind. A Government that has not this
grasp and is concerned''only with the rake-off can be
absolutely depended on not to know the meaning ot
a satisfactory run for the tote or for the public.

Nearly all the centuries made in Sydney
so far this season have been by resurrected or rep.
players. On Saturday the ancients who top-scored in
club matches were H. Carter (71) for Waverley,
Les Pve (57) for Central Cumberland, George
Jordan'(s6) for Gordon, A. J. Hopkins (41) for
Middle Harbor, and J. C. Barnes (33) for Peter-
sham. It is getting on for 20 years since some of
these smiters first troubled the scorers in premiership
cricket. But, after all, cricket is not football, and
a man who has looked after himself ought to be
going strong to moderate bowling at 50.
* * * *
S. C. Freeman (Gordon), who wrecked
Central Cumberland by taking seven wickets for 74
in Sydney premiership cricket on Saturday, seems
to be" a dangerous person when at large with a ball.
Earlier in the season Freeman took 7 for 18 against
Glebe. His bag of 25 wickets (averaging- 17.64)
is the best effort among the trundlers this year.
The only other seven-wickets-in-an-innings capture
was achieved by Rex Norman (Glebe) against Middle
Harbor at a cost of 47 runs. P. W. Dive s 6 for 38,
for Western Suburbs v. North Sydney, was also a
star effort. These are but the oases in a veritable
wilderness of deserts. * #
L. Wing (Sydney Grammar), who gath-
ered 6 wickets for 9 against King’s School at Parra-
matta last week, had been noticed before. In
last year’s G.P.S. final he gathered 3 for 49 and 6
for 20, and was just under top score with 41 runs.
For Combined Schools against Sydney University he
got 2 for 66 Still a better effort by Wing was i
for 5 against Scots’ College two years since. He
is a youngster of much promise on the pitch. I).
Munro (Sydney Grammar), who busied himself
accumulating 63 against King’s, is looked upon as
next year’s G.P.S. champion athlete, in this year s
championships he was second in 120yds. hurdles
and third in 100yds., 220yds. and broad jump.

Adelaide has let the war influence its
sport more, perhaps, than any other Australian city.
When peace came it had just started a revival of
grade cricket, barred to any “eligible.’' Players are
quite out of practice for any first-class play, never-
theless the S. A. Association is arranging to accept an
invitation from Victoria to get intei-State matches
going again in Christmas week. By the way, Harry
Blinman, the old Adelaide batsman, who is now an
Under-Secretary in the S.A. Government, has been
re-elected, for a sixth term, chairman of the Cricket
Board of Control of Australia.
* * # *
Although the signing of the armistice came
too late for the revival of Sheffield Shield cricket in
Australia this season, interstate fixtures are being'
arranged between N. S. Wales and Victoria for
December and January. The Board of Control
last week placed its presidential cares on the
shoulders of Harry Blinman (S. Aus.), an inter-
Stater of the ’eighties. Syd Smith (N.S.W.) will
do the secretary’s work and carry the bag.
Meanwhile an interesting subject for speculation
arises out of the smack administered by Mars to the
game generallv. Is cricket going to get back to
where it was in Australia a dozen years ago? There
are reasons for doubt on the subject. For many
days hefbre the war public interest in the game was
rapidly evaporating. The last lot of inter-State
matches passed almost unnoticed except among those
devoted enthusiasts who look upon the game as
something akin to a religious rite. And even they
watched the proceedings with a dim suspicion that
if cricket had been played always ljke that, they
might not have grown so enthusiastic about it. The
game has been getting duller and duller as a spec-
tacle each succeeding year, and this writer is firmly
persuaded that unless a time-limit is put upon it, or
scoring within a given number of runs per
hour is made compulsory, cricket is not going to
stir vast crowds of Australia into wild excitement
any more. It is impossible to get heated over a
game played with the deliberation of chess.
* * * *
A suggestion from Marylebone that a team
of Australians “who had served” should tour Eng-
land next season comes before the Board of Control
in a week or two. There is. of course, the material
in khaki for a team which would not be altogether
unrepresentative on paper. But about the capacity
of these players now after years of war no one
can say anything. Everything would have to be
taken on trust or on the performances of five
seasons ago, which is practically the same thing.
The invitation seems to be rather short and to
overlook the fact that getting cricket on its legs
again locally is to Australian players a matter of
more importance than rushing into international
fixtures. It will take a couple of seasons at least
to get the game even properly re-commenced on a
reasonable standard.
* * * *
Two Australian sculling champions passed
another milestone last week—Peter Kemp, 65
on the 14th; and Jim Paddon, 32 on the 19th.
Kemp held the world’s title in the ’eighties. Pad-
don is the present holder. What a great cleaning
up of titles of all sorts there will be in a year or so!

“Arthur C.”: Did anyone say there had
been no cockfighting in this country since Shakspeare
died? 'Well, I won’t tell you just how far it was
out of Botany where I watched a rattling good go
last Sunday." I understand they didn’t spend a
great deal in advts., but we had a muster of close
to 400, and they were not all rabbit-ohs, either.
Everything was in a big way, businesslike, methodi-
cal. I know of wagers totting to £l30 —and that
is only the betting that went on around my side of
the pit. In appearance the chooks were the oddest
matched ever. One was a typical old English black-
red game—wicked head and eye, body and thighs
that were bunches of muscles, feathers that fitted
close as scales. The other was an over-big black
Orpington sort of rooster, who looked as if he might
bake well if steamed half an hour or so first. Yet
those who know reckon it was the best scrap they
had this year. Each owner strapped a pair of
2-Jin. steel spurs to the carefully-pared-down spur
that nature had grown on his fowl; then each
passed it across for the other’s inspection. Each
satisfied, and the pug-chickens were sooled on, and
for an hour and 10 minutes each fowl did his worst
to the other. There weren’t five quiet seconds in that
70 minutes. It was a marvellous exhibition of
sustained, vigorous aggression—on both sides.
Black-red’s comb was a colander, and he watched
for openings with one eye. Old Black-orp. was
about plucked, and bled from 30 gashes, before he
finally drove one of those long steel daggers down
wards through Black-red’s eye and out of his throat.
That ended the contest, as well as Black-red. They
told me afterwards that this was the ninth successive
win for old Black-orp. Last I saw- of him he looked
like one of the Cow-laners after the push had finished
with the boot.
* * * *
“M. P. Adams”: When “Chev" (B.
7/11 /’18) talks about army training being responsible
for Jack Donaldson’s performances over distances,
cross-country or on the flat, he runs very wide of the
mark. Donaldson is one of those phenomenal athletes
who can make good at any game, quite apart from
his ability as a crack sprinter. If the money in pro-
fessional running had been in the middle-distance or
long-distance events Donaldson would have got away
with a hatful of it. The same thing would have
happened if Jack had taken to hurdles. He comes
of sound, athletic stock, his father being a good-class
athlete. Jack had a run in those army distance
races just for the sport of the thing, and with the
knowledge that he was equal to the game without
any army training. As to the blow lie received over
his defeat by Applcgath, the ex-British amateur, it
certainly was a crack, because the public sniffed hard,
alleging that there was an aroma in the vicinity.
Anyhow Applegath was never in the same class with
the wonderful Victorian, just in the same way as
world’s champion amateur, Walker, of South Africa,
failed to reach the Donaldson standard. Donaldson
is a good gunshot, driver, footballer, jumper, can
use his hands and is well in front as a dancer.
“X.Y.”: Almost every nation lias its Wil-
liam Tell, and the writer docs not deny that there
are many men in Australia who, if they happened to
be sober, could hit the end of a matchbox at a
hundred yards if they had a perfect rifle and perfect
ammunition. But as most of these wonderful per-
formances are said to have been put up with a sport-
ing magazine-rifle, let us take a rifle superior to this
type in point of accuracy, the military Martini-
Henry. At 200 yards the most perfect Martini,
when' fired from a' Whitworth rest, could only keep
a succession of shots within a five-inch circle. This
is equal to keeping them within a two and one-half
circle at 100 yards. A matchbox end measures
about three-fourths of an inch. The Americans
have made 200 yards their standard range, and have
done some wonderful shooting with the best rifles
extant, used with perfect ammunition. The powder
charge is weighed out with an assay-balance, and
placed in the shell with a wad over it. The bullet
is not inserted in the mouth of the shell, but is
entered into the rifling by means of an instrument
called a “ball seater.” With all these factors in
favor of accuracy it is considered brilliant shooting
to place 10 consecutive shots within a circle of two
and one-third inches, and fine work if within a
circle of three and one-third inches. Of course,
snorting rifles, using factory-filled ammunition, could
not approach this accuracy. Yet U. M. C. Thomas
with 10 consecutive shots once hit a target of x
inches, using factory-filled ammunition in a 25-30
Martini rifle at 200^ yards. # #
“Gee” : Mention of the swivel-gun for the
annihilation of duck on swamps and rivers (B.
7/11/’18) reminds me that manufacture of the artil-
lery was in the long ago a flourishing local industry
at' Geelong. Bar-iron spirals reducing from I*in-
to jin. were forged and welded together, and to
these were welded a piece of plate bent round. When
the joint was secure, the artillerist had a deadly
weapon. When the Law fell on him he stuck a
piece of stick in the apparatus and called it a gun,
and went on with the assassination. Ihen the Law
regulated the weight of charge that might be used,
and this put the deadly thing out of action.
“Simon II.” : Have done considerable fish-
ing in the Severn Biver, but caught nothing except
a species of freshwater cod. mud turtle and what is
locally known as carp. The cod is a fine fleshy
fellow, short in length and big in girth. One
caught weighing 181 b. was only 26in. long. About
20 miles from the scene of his demise the Severn
junctions with the Mclntyre. There cod, black bream,
dew-fish and yellowbelly (golden perch?) abound. The
cod in that stream is a handsome well-proportioned
fish with a spotted coat. I call him the Murray cod,
while the Severn fish I put down as a species ot
rock-cod. Does anyone know why there should be a
difference in the species inhabiting two streams
functioning with one another, and why there should
be a big variety of fish in one river and so few in
tlie other ? Tw'o theories held locally are that the
Severn lias a rocky bar forming a. fall at its junction
with the Mclntyre, thus preventing fish ascending,
and that the waters of the Severn are so impreg-
nated with lime that only certain species of fish will
settle in it permanently.
EXPLAINED.
[FOR THE BILLETIN.]
They sauntered from the starting-post,
And dawdled round the turn
With most indecent lack of haste —
They seemed to have for stakes no taste,
And speed appeared to spurn.
One almost heard each jock., with true
Politeness, murmur, “After you.”
It seemed that ere they found themselves
The winning post beside,
The riders would be old and gray.
“What sort of blanky racing, say,
Is this?” a punter cried.
One answered him, with anger hoarse:
“A wait for age event of course!”

M
v>* ;
DEFEND YOURSELF?
There is no excuse for you remaining crude and inexperienced in the art of
Self-Defence—a “punching-ball” for the first bully who crosses your path.
Why don’t you commence Boxing Lessons now—to-day ? Or must you first
get a sound thrashing- before you realise that to learn boxing- is a duty
you owe yourself?
I Teach Boxing by Post
My methods are simple, practical and thorough. You
cannot fail to progress rapidly, and will quickly
acquire a sound knowledge of the best moves of the
most celebrated boxers.
The course is very complete. It deals with every
serviceable punch and the most effective stop for it.
You’ll find mv instruction a really splendid recrea-
tion that will while away many a pleasant hour.
\nd how can you put your leisure to better advan-
tage than by learning to defend yourself?
You ought to write for my terms and for further
information, as given in my interesting booklet,
“Scientific Boxing in Your Home.” Just write your
name and address on this advertisement and post to
me. I’ll know what you mean. Send three penny

"Unalloyed” Dyes
The dyes used in Hose
of Luxite are "unalloyed”—not
loaded with heavy metallic com-
pounds to give the hose a glossy,
heavy appearance.
The soft, full-bodied shimmer of
Hose of Luxite is gained by the
use of rich, fine-stitched materials,
pure-dved.
That is why its elegance and
beauty last through repeated wash-
ings.
The wide range of styles and
prices will suit every purse and ;
purpose.
Don’t accept substitutes, and
think you have “Luxite.”
Insist upon the genuine.

Digestion Worth Having.
Good digestion is not appreciated until
you lose it. Then you cannot afford to ex-
periment, for strong medicines are hard on
weak stomachs.
To be able to eat what you want and to
digest it is a priceless blessing. If you have
lost it do not be deceived by the claims of
pre-digested foods and stomach tonics,
so-called.
There is no tonic for the stomach that is
not a tonic for every part of the body. As
the blood goes everywhere, an improvement
in its condition quickly results in strength-
ening weak organs. Rich, red blood is abso-
lutely necessary to digestion. If your
stomach is weak and you are troubled with
flatulence, sour risings in the throat, a feel-
ing of pressure about the heart and palpita-
tion, try the tonic treatment with Dr. Wil-
liams’ Pink Pills.
Do not put off finding relief a single day.
Get a box of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills to-
day and begin the treatment at once. Price
2s. 9d. per box. six boxes 15s. 3d.
The Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co. has issued
a free book, “What to Eat and How to
Eat,” that should be in every home. It gives

‘‘Trot’’ sees the maffick in Sydney on
Friday:—•
On the other side of the street I observed an
elderly citizen abstracting a bunch of carrots from
a Chinaman’s cart and rushing away decorated
with vegetables. Not the slightest atten-
tion is paid by Parliament to the ominous chorus
of factory-girls mounted on a motor-lorry dashing
in pursuit of a melodious taxi. It was of the most
urgent importance to the financial stability of the
Commonwealth that the procession into the pub
continued and the tune of 365 cowbells announced the
establishment of new industries. Industrial trouble
is one thing, but when 43 motor-horns hooted up
and down the diatonic scale there were loud cheers
and an explosion of crackers ever since the time
of Cobden and George Reid and the Egyptian fella-
heen working 18 hours a day five bands playing
Gor’save. Bang is a subject which to the German
mind is merely a trivial incident and Advance Aus-
tralia Fair with raucous yells and a piano in a
sulky. Continuation of the infernal noise is the
soundest protection to the social welfare of the
people and to their greater dignity in matters con-
nected with uproarious declarations that Tipperary
is still in the distance. The division of raw
materials among the lady who fell off a cart and
empty kerosene-tins carried by the nation’s com-
petitors in manufacturing having the advantage of
juvenile labor to smite the tins with stones and
markets where yowls of joy at a defunct turkey
suspended above a hansom cab. The world was
once a peaceful place, but the rising generation
have become addicted to noise, and Hughes with his
clamorous demands for the German colonies and the
falling walls of Jerusalem were nothing compared
with a battalion of kids armed with bugles visualising
an Imperialism from which memories of the War-
wick egg and Holman’s borrowing exploits when
tramcars rattled like siege-guns along the Meuse
and musical accompaniments on a side-car. Little
bells and big bells, dinner-bells and tea-bells clash
with the conflicting interests which tinkled when
Carthage was mighty and Rome was mistress of
squeakers by the score, the hundred and the million.
Alone like Joe Cook in London or Hans Jensen on
a peak in Darien heard a crash and then another,
and our exports rose in value like cheers from the
proletariat as a myriad flags were waved and
throats grew tired and Noise born to a new day, for
the democracy ushered in an era when quietness was
a rumor. Every economist in a toyshop and whistles,
mouth-organs and cymbals sounded and the dulcimer
proclaimed victory. There is another aspect of riot-
ous music, since if the pub isn’t closed by a virtu-
ous Ministry in the interests of public sobriety and
I go and see what’s inside so the last shilling of
Andrew Fisher will not be mine. I may be gone
till midnight yawns and graves go back to bed and
trombones bray and peace broods o’er a happy world
like exploding volcanoes and bursting locomotives.

Goodyears are Best and Cheapest for Fords.
Ford, Chevrolet and Maxwell Cars are
often purchased for reasons of economy—
but this object is frequently only half
attained because of inferior tyre equipment.
THE 1918 Goodyear 30 x 3i All Weather
Tread Tyre marks a big advance in tyre
values for owners of all cars equipped with
30 x Beaded edge Rims, which are standard on
Ford, Maxwell and Chevrolet Cars.
The Big Diamond Blocks now on the Goodyear
30 x All Weather Tread give more than double
the wear of any smooth tyre, with the added factors
of safety, appearance and freedom from trouble.
When you take into consideration the known
superiority of Goodyear manufacture, their price
makes these new 30 x A.W.T. Goodyears
the best and most economical equipment for
your car.
Compare the price of 30 x 3-J- Goodyears with
other non-skid tyres on this market.
In the five best sellers among anti-skid tyres in
Australia to-day, A is sold at £B/6/8, B at £B/7/-,
C at £B/11/6, and D at £B/-/-.
The price of the Goodyear 30 x 3JA.W.T. is £8/3/-,
and knowing this and realising the extra value in
Goodyear Tyres, you can only cometo theconclusion
that the Goodyear 30 x 3*4 All Weather Tread is
the only tyre equipment worth consideration.
Ask the Goodyear Service Station Dealer to show you Goodyear Tyres, Heavy
Tourist Tubes and Tyre Saver Accessories. There is a dealer in your locality.

The “Super” Fx S R Watch
The original “Fx and R” watches arc known
throughout Australasia for their marvellous accuracy
and endurance.
But, as usual, we progress, and so now we are
showing the Super “Fx and It" Watch.
its present price is 03/-, in Steel Case, but what
a watch it is! Every latest improvement known
to horological science is in it.
It is jewelled in every part where wear occurs.
Tt will go with profound accuracy; indeed, it is so
accurate that a ship could be steered to England
by it.
For strength and standing up against hard wear,
we unhesitatingly say that no watch, the world
over, equals the Super “Fx and R” Watch.

Some fuss is being made because many
houses in Svdney, the oldest of Australian
cities, are without a bathroom, and without
any feasible place for inserting one. Natu-
rally they are. Every well-built, middle-
aged house was born before the time when
bathroqms were dreamed of as necessary
features of an ordinary domicile. The
builder wasn’t responsible any more than
is the builder of to-day who doesn’t pro-
vide flats with a compressed-air apparatus,
or a mental tank for holding ideas, or even
a room for the handy family aeroplane in
which will be one of the commonplaces of
life to-morrow, and a movable wall so that
it can get in and out. If a house is to be
solid and weatherproof, and neither a tot-
tering oven in summer nor a staggered ice-
chest in winter, it must be built to stand
for 100 years. Then if it is to be. kept up
to date and civilised it must be pulled down
or reconstructed in 20 years. That is why
a great many people prefer to put their
money in Government securities. It doesn’t
matter whether a debenture has a bathroom
attached or not.
“No. 4”: I have just been reading the
Commonwealth Gazette, No. 71. under
the heading of “Commonwealth Public Ser-
vice Examination, Section 703, for appoint-
ment of telegraph messenger in the Mel-
bourne and Suburban Post Offices” :
It is hereby notified that the results of the above
examination, as published on page 20C8 of the
Commonwealth Gazette. No. 165, of the 24th
October, 1918, are amended in the following particu-
lars —by the alteration of the total number of marks
obtained by Thomas Joseph Corrigan from 237 to
337, and the consequent raising of his position on
the list from 328th to 100th place.
This is signed by W. B. Edwards, Acting
Commissioner, and so that there will not be
any error, H. A. Earle, Acting Secretary, has
also signed it at the Offices of the Common-
wealth Public Service Commissioner, Mel-
bourne. I was glad to see that Tommy
was getting on, because he really is
a smart boy, but at the same time I venture
to make the following suggestion: That as
this is important enough to occupy 2in. x 4
column in the Commonwealth Gazette it
might be worth cabling it through to London,
so that anybody who knows Tommy over
there might rejoice with us.
Australian bee-men have manifold dis-
couragements. Petrol-tins, for instance, of
which the Federal Government owns a vast
supply, are the correct, untainted container
for honey, but the authorities offer only kero-
sene-tins. This means a probability of tainted
produce and would quite spoil the chances
of the export trade, even if Hughes’s dream-
ships could be miraculously turned into the
real article.- The result of these conditions
is that, in many cases where farmers have
worked up a few dozen bee-colonies as a side-
line, they don’t bother nowadays to rob the
hives, merely taking enough for their own
use and letting the rest of the outfit go to
ruin. Yet the Repatriation Department’s
records show that ‘‘suitable” men are being
assisted into bee-farming as a self-contained
rural industry. The Repatriation experi-
ments are an interesting collection to those
who find time hanging heavy on their hands.
“Wart”: How about this for a long-dis-
tance memoriam? In St. John’s Church,
Launceston (Tas.), there is a stained-glass
window :
To the glory of God and the memory of
RANDOLPH DE LITTELOR,
Wallescot, Cheshire, England. 1234,
This window is erected by his descendant,
Frank 1 Mevvyn de Littelor, Dedicated July 21, 1912.
“Chudah”: The site for the new Jewish
University on the Mount of Olives was
bought from the executors of John Gray
Hill, : an English millionaire, who built a
house there. Not long before the war Hill
told the members of a Jewish club in Liver-
pool,- S “From my house there is the most
glorious view in the world.” It was then the
ambition of the Zionist Society to found the
University there, but this seemed only a dis-
tant hope. J. G. Hill first put the idea into
its hekid, being desirous to sell. The Eng-
lish have just given Jerusalem the first pro-
per water-supply it has enjoyed throughout
all the ages, with pipes laid from a natural
reservoir called Arroub. The English and
Australians have also laid a double - track
broad-gauge railway from Cairo to Jerusa-
lem. How far and fast we have travelled!
“Helwena” : “Figurehead” (B. 31/10/T8)
is talking through his turban wlien he speaks
of the Cutty Sark making the passage
between London and Melbourne in 55 days in
3875-76. The Sark was a great Australian
trader, and in her ocean career made 11
voyages to Sydney, three to Newcastle and
one bach to Melbourne and Brisbane. In
1872-73 she made her first and only passage
to Melbourne in 78 days. The record passage
from England to Australia is the Ther-
mopylae’s 63 days to Melbourne in 1868-69.
Both ships were in Melbourne in February,
’73, and it is alleged that their mainsails
were spread out and measured on Williams-
town Pier to settle long-standing deep-water
arguments and bets. There must have been
quite a lot of shipping in Melbourne at the
time, for 90 per cent, of ancient mariners
still above water claim to have been present
on that occasion.
While the British ’planes were soaring and
diving over Fritz’s head, the military
fashioneers were bqsily planning a gorgeous
new uniform for the air forces. The details
came out just when the Hun started for
home and revolution. The airman’s new cap
is to be the same saucy shape of the old one,
but the crown is to be light blue. The
jacket, too, is to be light blue, but the belt-
buckle is to have twi> prongs instead of one.
(That fine point may have been debated for
days.) Trousers and breeches of light blue,
and shirts and collars blue or silver grey.
The air-dandies will have to get in some
brainwork in their boudoirs when they come
to consider boots and puttees: “Boots and
shoes worn with trousers must be black, but
with breeches the wearer has the choice of
black boots and light blue puttees, brown
/boots and brown gaiters, or brown field-boots.
Black field-boots may continue to be worn
as laid down in A.M.W.C. 331 of 1918.”
Also “instructions as to overcoats and water-
proofs will be issued later.” Powder-puffs,
of course,; are supplied free in the light blue
atmosphere by the enemy’s anti-aircraft bat-
teries.

THE fascination of
field shooting is due to
the uncertainty of getting the
game. The interest in shooting is the
ability to reduce those uncertainties to the mini-
mum. A well trained dog, a good gun and
cartridges are among the necessary elements.
Produced by experienced makers and re-
cognized everywhere by keen sportsmen
as of unsurpassed quality, Remington
UMC cartridges will help you to com-
bine the elements which make a good
shot and which bring home
the full bag.

“Rexona Soap is Excellent for Baby” says a Tasmanian Mother.
“I have been using your Rexona Soap for my baby Nancy ever since
she was born, and I think it a splendid Soap for Babies, writes Mrs. J. .
Robinson, Waratah, Tasmania. “It is excellent for the skm and hair, and
Baby likes it so well. She knows it as well as I do.
“I, too, have used your Rexona Soap and think it is excellent, and
1 can assure you that Baby and I will never be without it in the house. I
had Baby’s picture taken, which I am sending you and hope you will
like it.”

A really dependable razor at a popular

■without removing the blade. This con-
struction also overcomes the difficulty of
cleaning, which is the bugbear of so

Strongly made, heavily silvered, and with
blades that cannot be surpassed, it is

Wax Candles.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HOW many, gauze-winged workers
To sate th'eir liir st among the honey
their greed !
WUon"rifling hands had done their lawless
And left, perhaps, a queen forever still !
Moulded for glittering sconces dripping down
Above some watchful cardinal’s regal head,
Wavering in orange points about the red,
The splendid scarlets of his cape and gown
To pale, upon his signet ring, the glow
Of a girl’s face in blushing cameo.
Wax candles guttering near an open door
In some great hall of carnival and. sin
A wind that brings the breath of lilac in
And flings the pearly grease discs on the floor
And lifts the curls on young brows, damp
with lust, . . ,
To tell of dew on flowers, and rain on dust,
And hedgeways glimmering underneath a
And small birds twittering in a mist ot
boughs, . , „
To presently make vapid fiery vows,
And all too loud the clacking of their shoon,
Till one who challenged Fate with boastful
breath
Sees the mask slip upon the face ot Death.
And Day comes leaping, naked, from the
hills; i i
Haste rides, a black postilion, from the door;
The candles flicker on an empty floor.
(lone are the powdered wigs, the draggled
frills. .
My Lady’s chair is carried from the rout.
The hirelings yawn. ...and put the candles
out.
Wax candles! Soft about some Borgia’s
feast . , . „ ~
Mirrored a thousand times in plate ot gold,
Warm in 'the cup— that leaves a guest too
The C brew of some strange fruitage of the
That brings a muffler for a violent deed,
The very draught to fill a Borgia’s need .
Among the silken hangings of her bower
A dark queen waits. Above her listening
head .
The candles like a galaxy are spread.
She sighs and smiles. And in that very hour
To teach a fool his trysting to forget,
They fling her lover down the oubliette... •
Wax candles blaze about a fair-haired king—■
Just .sixteen years ! He pines for hawk and
wold, , ~
And almost hates the sire who now lies cold
That he should leave him to this irksome
thing. , . ,
Far rather would he have the vine-hung
bench , , , , .
Than this gilt chair; some lusty red-cheeked
wench
Instead of this pale, bloodless girl they bring
Loaded with jewels. In her eyes a strife.
She too had dreams. Perchance a waxen
wife
The State can mould.is fitter for a lung
Than some brave maid whose blood is over-
red.
He craved a mate —he gains a figurehead!
Wax candles guide the student, to his books,
Brown leathern chair and dark mahogany,
Tall candlesticks, which, polished, brassily.
Throw ample light on his cadaverous looks,
The brain from body overmuch doth steal.
He bought the candles —but forgot the meal!
Wax candles on a boudoir table. Rose
The poppy shades upon them. Rose they
rest
Their gules upon the glory of her breast
Till one prints kisses where those rays repose
And snuffs each wick with an impatient hand,
Feeling the dark can better understand....
Wax candles! Are ye passing with the
years?
Gone with brown sails and all that used to
be.
Quenched in the floods of electricity.
Gone with the low-toned laugh, the gentle
Gone with the old Romance, from cooler
blood.
Gone with the soothing of your twilight
mood.
Gone with the jesting o’er the bubbling

M. FORREST.
Spiky of the ’Loo.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SPIKY STOTT slipped out of Junction-
lane and shot away in the direction
of the wharf—he had immediate
business, not necessarily at the wharf, hut
very necessarily as far away from Junction-
lane as possible—immediately. The leather
soles of his feet beat a diminishing tattoo on
the pavement as his small urgent figure grew
smaller in the distance.
Spring’s mantle had come down a few
days since; that was the trouble. What
with mauve wistaria singing on the back
balcony and pink and yellow blossom pour-
ing down the wall, and the rain stopping, and
Dad’s new job and one thing and .another,
things had suddenly got too much for Spiky.
He went berserk —saw red and ran amok.
Never meticulously law-abiding, he found
the Spring days perfect hell —straps and
shoes and heavy hands only heartened and
braced him for new discoveries.
Turner-lane and Corfu-street, the lower
ends of Bourke-street and Palmer-street, ■
Bland-strect, the broad wharfside —all these]
knew Spiky, and feared and hated him; only I
Junction-lane in all the ’Loo could keep him
in his place. But none held him in fear.
To-day he had taken what seemed a fitting
opportunity of letting the lodger’s baby down
from the balcony to the yard, by a simple and
perfectly safe device of clothes-line and
blanket. The results, corporeally, were terri-
fic. He fled and ran down to Coaly’s yard m
Bourke-street. He was safe there until he
got hungry again.
Spiky’s mother washed. Time was when
she had washed and wept at intervals; and
washed again ; now, she just washed. His
father worked at intervals; sometimes by
force, sometimes by the day; never from
choice. The early by-force periods coincided
with Hum’s early weeping and with Spiky s
babyhood. These periods by force increased
in duration, and automatically the oppor-
tunities by the day decreased ; so Mum got
the habit of washing and lost that unhappy
one of weeping. , , . . .
“What’s up?” said Coaly Mimbles in his
yard. It was really his father’s yard, but
it was known as Coaly’s; its name was
“Coaland WOod tErms casll,” and it was
a place of abiding mystery and charm.
“Nuflin’.” Spiky was terse; he had had a
nervous morning, and was not. disposed to
spend any more of it in society piattle.
“Wliat’s new?”
“Nuflin',” Coaly said in his turn. Me
braver come in last night. ’E’s got anuver
<a Coaly’s brother had always intrigued
Spiky. From his earliest days lie remem-
bered him, incurably well-dressed and tired,
and incredibly rich. As some stranger from
a better world he lounged down Spiky s
childhood years with pockets full of trays
and sprats and bobs; with a silent tongue
and a close-shut smileless mouth. Whiles, he
went to Melbourne on business, and whiles
he tackled that labor by force. But the
Melbourne business was always good busi-
ness, and a man can’t have everything.
Spiky saw him in his dreams as a bored and
beloved thrower of largesse, silent and tired.
“ ’ls wife was wiv ’im.” She wasn t; she
was in Brisbane, but Coaly didn’t know
that. “And there was a row. She
didn’t ’arf give it to Cliff, do you know
that ?”
“What’d Cliff done?”
“Oh, I dunno —stayed over in Melbourne
or bin late or surfin’ —I dunno. Any’ow, Tilda
follered ’im when ’e come ’ere and made a
row, till Mum stopped ’er and turned
’em both out. Cliff gimme ’arf a crown,
though. And ’e’s got a new car.” ■
“Did ’e go ’ome —to ’is old ’ouse, I mean t
“I s’pose so. Why?”
“Nuflin’,” said Spiky for the second time,
as he padded swiftly out of the yard again.
In Cathedral-street two pepper-trees made
a fine green rain before a small, but in no way
poor, house. It wore a self-conscious air of
discretion and secretiveness; and it was not
shabby or in want of painting or curtains or
apparently in any temporal, want at all;
which was bad camouflage—it was too un-
usual in the ’Loo to be other than conspicu-
ous. This was a pity; Clifford Mimbles
wasn’t purse-proud, and didn’t care a damn
for his neighbor’s opinion—for anything but
silence and seclusion. It wasn’t his fault;
Tilda spent his money that way when he was
in Melbourne (or at work) ; she liked it
better than booze sometimes, and she. was
the boss —or made a noise like it, which is
the same thing. And the trim little house
and garden were something for Cliff to re-
member in Melbourne or at work, whether he
wanted to or not.
Spiky took up a good if blatant position
on the angle of the back and side walls of
Cliff's back yard. He disliked Tilda —ho
wasn’t afraid of her like Cliff, but he dis-
liked her; the strategic advantage of his
elevation, in hostile event, either for advance
or retreat, is obvious. His wait was longer
than he expected; the Spring evening fell
softly and touched the chimney-pots and
broken roofs with a magic finger; threw a
kindly mist of shadows over the jam-tins and
bottles in the lane, and over the climbing
green and pink which needed no kindliness
or magic. The shadows darkened; a few
lights jumped out of the mist and six o’clock
rang from the post-office. The ’Loo dies
daily at 6 p.m.; its final kick as a rale is a
good one, but at six, or a few minutes after,
it is dead and buried. Old Nosey lurched
down the lane, still crooning softly his morn-
ing cry for old iron. “Any old bedsteads?
Any oid bedsteads?” Presumably one wakes
and sells the bed, if the morning looks pro-
pitious—all the bedsteads are old.
“Allow me to inform you that you are a
bastard.” It was Tilda’s voice, articu-
lating with a slow, affected precision, a
labored courtesy, which could mean only one
thing : Tilda was drunk.
Cliff came out to the washhouse in shirt
sleeves; Spiky’s heart jumped as he saw the
only friend he could remember since Mum
stopped weeping and took on washing only.
Cliff looked tired, as usual; Tilda had appa-
rently been “changing a pound” on her own—
if not two. to judge from the sagging figure
that stumbled and fumbled after Cliff.
“And me married a lieutenant and got to
mix with the riff-raff about ’ere. ’Ard? —
’ard. ’Ow dare you strike me with a jug?”
“Don’t talk silly.” Cliff spoke for the first
time. “And go to bed. ’Ere, I’ll help you.”
“Yer gaolbird. Knockin’ a’ old man about
in Strathfield- —done time for it, too. Always
doin’ time.... Oo ! yer coward.... ”
Tilda’s heavy politeness and precision of
speech gradually disappeared; she subsided
on the washhouse floor, in maudlin tears of
bad whisky and beer. Presently she snored.
Cliff sighed and came out into the yard.
Spiky dropped off the wall like a cat.

MAKE THAT WEAK BACK STRONC!
In these trying days we need every ounce of strength and the
ability to do a full day’s work every day. The man or woman with
weak kidneys is half crippled. A lame, stiff back, with its constant
dull ache and sharp, shooting twinges, makes the simplest task a
burden and a full day’s work impossible. Headaches, dizzy spells,
urinary disorders and an “all worn out” feeling are daily sources of
distress. You can’t afford to neglect kidney weakness and make it
easy for gravel, dropsy or incurable kidney disease to take you. Get
a bottle of DOAN’S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS to-day.
They have helped many Sydney people. They should help you.
SYDNEY TESTIMONY.
A REBFERN RESIDENT.
Mr. .T. O’Brien, 2 Zamia Street, Redfern, Sydney,
says:—“For a good many years I suffered from dis-
ordered kidneys, backache being the worst symptom.
Occasionally it was so bad that I could not rise from my
chair or turn in bed. Even when able to move about
I had a continual ache in the back, as if my kidneys had
been pinched. When my back was troublesome the
secretions caused me much anxiety, as they were fre-
quent. and small in quantity. This describes my
complaint up to the time I got Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills. From that time I began to improve rapidly, and
now I am quite well. I consider that Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills are invaluable to the kidney sufferer, and
they have my hearty recommendation.”
Sixteen years later Mr. O’Brien says:—“Sixteen
years ago Doan’s Backache Ividney Pills cured me of
kidney trouble, and I have been well ever since.
1 am a great believer in this grand remedy, and with
reason.”
AN UNDERGLIFFE RESIDENT.
Mrs. G. Gavin, Wanstead-street, Undercliffe,
Sydney, says“ For about four years I suffered a good
deal from backache and kidney trouble, and only those
who have been afflicted in this way will have any idea
of what I went through. The pain in my back was so
severe that I could hardly move, especially in the
morning, when it was often almost impossible for me
to get out of bed without assistance. Other symptoms of
kidney trouble were bad headaches and dizzy attacks, both
of which were very trying. I was treated by a.doctor
for some time, and also tried different kidney remedies
I saw advertised, but nothing did me any good. Doan's
Backache Kidney Pills were at last brought under my
notice, and they proved to be the very thing I wanted.
After taking one bottle I felt ever so much better, and
nine bottles of the pills cured me completely, and I have
been free from pain ever since. It is eight years since I
took Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, so my cure has been
well tested.”

. Ullo, boy,” said Cliff. “ ’Ow are they
asm you?”
“Not too bad.” Spiky grinned as Cliff gave
him half a croAvn in silence. “Ta,” he said.
:V„ heavy knocking sounded in the house;
Cliff’s tired face Avent Avhite.
"What's that?” said Spiky.
Cliff said nothing—just stood there uncer-
tainly, looking desperately AA'hite and tired ; a
defiant snore came from Tilda in the wash-
house.
“ ’Ere. Avant to cut it, Cliff? I’ll get yer
car to yer Avherever yer say”
A single knock sounded on the yard gate;
Cliff sighed again and unbolted it.
“Well, Red,” as a large man walked into
the yard, “what is it this time?”
Ullo, Cliff, ’ said Red, “false pretences
again.”
“But I only come out day before yester-
day, Red.”
‘T lenow. Cliff—sorry; old case in Mel-
bourne. The report only came in this
mornin . Morris and Parker case at Men-
zies Hotel. Remember?”
“All right,” said Cliff, “who’s that at the
front?”
“Tyrrell. What’s this kid doin' ’ere?”
Spiky Avas standing Avith bulging eyes,
listening to the incomprehensible chatter.
Ihe gist of things was clear to him, but
the details were too impressionist for easy
assimilation. He could see that Cliff
looked suddenly old, and he knew that he
wanted badly to got away.
“Oh. ’e’s a friend o’ mine. ’Ere, boy,”
said Cliff. Out of his pocket he took a
roll of notes; ho glanced at Red, who turned
his back, as Cliff separated a pound-note
and gave it to Spiky. “I got to go away ;
buy some lollies and tell the folks Tilda’s
been changing a pound. Good-bye, kid.”
Spiky stood in silence as the tAVo tall
figures walked down the yard to the house;
they Avent in to the accompaniment of the
intermittent knocking at the front.
The Spring and the lodger’s baby and the
cat; ( lill came hack—and now this: Spiky
gave in. Two burning tears ran a difficult
course down his cheeks as he slipped up the
wall and dropped into the lane. At the
corner Coaly stood, apparently, taking the
“\\ hat’s up ?” he said, as Spiky passed
him.
Nuffin’, ’ yelled Spiky, wild with anger,
as he fled sobbing into the night.
FRANCIS BRIEN.
The Last Man.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
FOR three nights and days the bom-
bardment had not lessened in inten-
sity. For three nights and days an
ever-thinning line of filthy grey-faced automa-
tons had waited for a. merciful transition into
the Land of Utter Silence. And yet, every
man. as he was hit, called upon God to keep
him alive until the German masses advanced
into the open. At noon on the third day a
shell splinter smashed the lieutenant’s spine,
and he died blaspheming Avith rage at his
OAvn impotence. So waited these grim mono-
maniacs for the consummation of existence
—to die killing. The plastic earth Avas
blotched Avith the green deposit of dissipating
gases and the crumbling defences seemed to
bubble with their own instability. But above
all was Sound — that quickening staccato of
A’iolence that had at last merged into an
everlasting shuddering roar. Se\ T enty hag-
gard humans, Avhose eyes twitched in the
agony of their throbbing nerves, coAvered
down in the mud ; for they Avere to defend an
untenable position until death.
Half an hour before sunset the bombard-
ment abruptly ceased and then recommenced
at their rear. Two red-eyed apparitions
claAved their Avay up the shattered parapet
and stared out across the open ground. In
answer to their frenzied yell of Avarning the
weary men climbed up and prepared for the
end. A hundred and fifty yards away, and
advancing rapidly, came a huge grey mass of
men. They moved in perfect silence and the
dying sun gleamed dully on their bayonets.
The French parapet became alive Avith spit-
ting flashes, hut the mass never hesitated. It
came forward irresistibly like a great squat
beast of metal.
.lean Rodaf, the third man from the ex-
treme left, discovered with a shiver that his
rifle had jambed. All the fear of the last
three days, which had been dissipated by the
excitement of the attack, returned to him
with added horror, for he now felt weapon-
less. For a moment he thought of surren-
der; then Avith a feeling of nausea he remem-
bered the crucified sergeant whom his platoon
had discovered a fortnight previously in an
abandoned cottage. He swiftly looked rear-
ward, but between him and the second line
were great roaring fountains of flame and
filth Avhose SAVollen crests swayed in the
turbid air. As he looked he caught a glimpse
of a dark blotch on the rear wall of the
trench. With a thrill of joy he recognised
the entrance to the dead lieutenant's dug-
out, and it was still unharmed. He quickly
thrust back his legs and slid down on to the
floor of the trench. Then he flung himself
into the black opening. Ilis right-hand com-
rade noticed the backward fall arid turned
his head with an ejaculation of pity. The
next instant he swung his rifle round from
the ledge and fired at the retreating man
just as he disappeared.
Four hundred men surged up over the
rotting parapet and plunged down into the
trench until it Avas filled with a mass of
heaving and cursing humanity. Here and
there in the surging stream of men violent
little eddies suddenly broke out to swirl
savagely for a few seconds and then as
rapidly subsided. Occasionally out of the
tumult a voice, high-pitched with ferocity,
screamed forth blasphemously until the cries
abruptly terminated in a choking snarl.
From the beginning the contest was
hopeless. In less than three minutes the
last swirling eddy was calmed, and the last
cursing voice silenced. Sixty-nine weary
men had found oblivion.
Below, in the darkness, Rodaf lay quietly
where he had fallen and tried to calm his
palpitating heart. The dugout was almost
a paradise of silence, and only the faintest
travesty of the roaring barrage filtered down
into his ears. The re-action gradually set
in. By degrees the pulsing of his heart
returned to normal and with the calmness
came a God-sent weariness. He began
to suffer from an almost overwhelming
desire to turn over on to his side
and sleep. The angular curtain of fad-
ing light that hung down from the entrance
to the floor held his gaze with a drowsy
fascination. The horizontal shadows of the
steps which striped the curtain reminded him
of some ethereal ladder stolen from a dream.
He knew that he was being defeated in this
fight against sleep, yet he was vaguely con-
tented in defeat, llis head leaned further
and further back towards the damp ground
until it rested peacefully. Just as he was
becoming unconscious something damp and
heavy fell on to his face and slid off on
to the ground. He awakened with a start
and flung one arm out sideways. Ilis clutch-
ing hand fell upon an arm clothed in a
sleeve, and it seemed to move at his touch.
For a moment his heart almost choked him ;
then by using his knees as a lever he thrust
himself upon the invisible man. His uvo
hands slipped mechanically over the shoul-
ders to the neck. Five seconds after wards
he was back again, in his corner, for the neck
was wet and icy cold. lie sat up against
the angle of the two walls with one of the
table legs in his hand.
All at once it occured to him that in all
.probability he was the sole survivor. He
had heard indistinctly of the raid,
but now the outer world appeared to he
drenched in silence. At the further end of
the dugout he could just make out a faint
lightening of the darkness, like a greyish
blur. He determined to go to the foot of the
steps and listen for any sound of .hostile
movement. He moved slowly and cautiously
toward the steps, feeling forward Avith the
table leg to locate any obstacles. At length
he saw a patch of star-flecked sky
framed in the opening. He could
hear no noise beyond the shuddering
boom of distant gun-fire, so he commenced
to climb. When he reached the entrance he
observed that the wall of the trench ten
yards away was illuminated by the glow of
a fire. He twisted his head and saw seven
German infantrymen seated around a
brazier.
So absorbed in this scene was the cold and
hungry Rodaf that he failed to hear the noise
of feet coming round the tra verse beside him.
Suddenly he realised that the menacing fig-
ure of a German officer Avas standing in
front of him in the gloom, peering into his
face. Surprise rendered both men silent, and
neither moved. The first to startle was
Rodaf. His arms Avent swiftly outwards. He
gripped the German by the shoulders and
heaved backward with all his weight. For
an instant they swayed in the entrance;
then both fell into the blackness. As they
fell Rodaf cursed himself for a fool. When
they reached the bottom of the steps he got
up on to his feet and waited. He heard a
panting outburst of guttural invective, and
then an electric torch flashed in his face.
He lifted both arms in token of surrender
and looked calmly at the eyes behind the
light. The Hun hesitated, and his lips
curled back-in a sneer. Then he deliberately
spat into Rodaf's face and reached back to
his pistol pocket.
The maddened Rodaf sprang at him like a
cat. The light vanished and the torch
crackled beneath the trampling feet. Two
grunting tearing beasts staggered gaspingly
across the dugout, smashed into the over-
turned table, and thudded against the wall.
All at once the two hurtling bodies struck and
scattered a heap of empty tins. The noise
became appalling and floated upwards into
the trench.
The two wrestlers in the darkness sud-
denly heard a harsh commanding voice.
“Franzose ?”
The Hun stiffened and tried to answer,
but his “Nein! Nein!” hardly whispered
from his burning mouth.
Then Rodaf with a terrible effort broke the
grip on his throat, and screamed out the only
two German words he knew: “Kaiser!
Schwein!”
The echo was the roaring crash of a
bursting bomb.

Fear.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I AM afraid of the dead men, the cold
men, the old men,
Waking out of the vanished years,
Calling me, calling me full of tears;
“Woman, take up your quick pen, your new
pen, your true pen.
Write the songs that a man might sing;
Mount your dreams on the eagle-wing,
For Time is fleet
On drifting feet.
And soon the bells of the dust will ring.”
I am afraid of the dead maids, the white
maids, the light maids,
Hurrying up from the olden lands,
Whispering' low through their hollowed
hands:
“Woman, dance in the green-glades, the day-
glades. the play-glades;
Love and live to the body’s fill;
Youth and beauty and laughter spill,
For you must go
Where no joys flow,
And under boughs in the dark lie still.”
1 am afraid of my own mind, my wild mind,
my child-mind.
All that I fashion with dreams aglow;
Shudders to sleep as the night-airs blow:
“Woman, gather the far wind, the high wind,
the sky wind.
Pluck the stars from the fields of Fear.
Heart and soul are less than a tear.”
I am afraid
Of all things made.
O God, my God, do not come too near!
