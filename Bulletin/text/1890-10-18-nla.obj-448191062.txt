should be able to ascertain which
DillY-aiJAliriED PIS ACT1TIONEKS
make these Diseases a speciality, particularly as, under
the present law, any person can call himself Doctor or

persons exist, chiefly, because Duly Qualified Prac-

Dr. PERRY invites the fullest investigation into his
credentials, and gives his Personal Consideration to
each Case, and in all oases tells the Patient the exact
nature of his complaint, the cost of a cure, and the time
it will take. ,
Dr. PERRY'S experience in the treatment of these
Diseases has been so varied and extensive, that he is able
to tell absolutely whether the case is curable or not, and
therefore is willing to

\\ estern Australia is a much richer colony than is
generally supposed as regards minerals, agriculture and
pastoralism.— Sir Samuel Griffith.
Professor Brown, of Victoria, who made a thorough
examination of the south-western portion of AVestern
Australia, states that not the other colonies only, but
even the people of AA T estern Australia evidently do not
know how much there is waiting for development. He
saw thousands of acres in contiguous blocks of fine choco-
late lands, light clay loams, and peaty soils. He thinks
the important features of the district are Its grand climate
and regular rainfall.

SPECIAL MEDICAL NOTICE.
Dr. G. H. RAYMOND,
The Eminent
Botanic Physician, Specialist I Medical Writer,
Has commenced Practice in Sydney, after a residence of
four years in Queensland, twelve mouths in Western Aus-
tralia, nearly three years in South Australia, and eighteen
months in the City of Melbourne.
The latter place Mr. Raymond was compelled to abandon
in consequence of the,climate proving detrimental to his
health.
During, DR- RAYMOND’S jrractical experience of nine
years in Australia he has built up "a reputation un-
approached by any other physician in chronic diseases in
the colonies. Dr. Raymond has also relieved and cured
patients who had tried to no avail the so-called leading
medical talent in the world. Proof of this will be seen in
his valuable and scientific publications; and Dr. Raymond
would call the attention of deaf people to his latest scien-
tific paper on the “ Merits and Demerits of Artificial Ear-
Drums and Electro-Magnetic Treatment.”
DR. RAYMOND would also inform deaf persons that he
is the only AURIST in the British Empire that ever
exposed the fallacy of sticking ear-drums in the ear for
cure of deafness; and, moreover, it is rank quackery for
any “Aurisf’or “Oculist” to induce people to believe
that a mere external remedy will cure a disease, the root
of which lies in the genera] constitution.
DR. RAYMOND is a Thorough Physician, as well as a
Specialist ; hence his unrivalled success.
A series of Aural and Ophthalmic Papers, supplementary
to a volume published in 1887, will be sent on receipt of a
penny stamp, Address

Dr. Raymond intends shortly to Lecture on the eminent
American Med cal Philosopher Dr. Samuel Thomson
founder of the Botanic System of Practice, and the first
man to expose the Errors and Fallrcies of the Faculty.
Dr. Raymond will, when he mounts the public platfor'in
be the youngest medical lecturer and advocate in the
English-speaking world, he not having vet attained his
thirtieth year.

™ „ ... T 10th December, 1888.
To H. I-. KtJGEUIAKN, Esq.
Dear Sir,-This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into bronchitis and became chronic. I consulted
wore, hnn one doctor, and during that time took a great
quant tig ~/ medicine without it doing me the slightest
goo, , but I became worse every day, wasting away until
I become a perfect skeleton. About February last i began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in rv;v left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I
was expectorating every day, I became very much alarmed.
Hearing ot your professional skill 1 consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. I agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. At the
end of three months I was taken bad one morning and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. Prom that time I commenced to improve, anil
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, 1 am as well as ever. ' 1

known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life-
time to the study of.
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to hit
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.

gressions or excesses of more nature age, bladder

been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tendant,
ONE POUND IS SUFFICIENT TO

she found so invaluable when she visited New Orleans
during the last yellow fever epidemic, in order, by her
concerts, to raise funds for the benefit of the stricken

whioh the crowded hospitals were unable to supply to
thousands of applicants. Madame Roze was advised by

Acting on the Liver, Bowels and Kidneys imperceptibly

Its utility as a remedy in fevers, and as a cooling drink

Labour and Politics.
The carping anxiety which has been evinced
by the present Government of New South
Wales —by members of Parliament in general,
with honourable exceptions lest the
Labour-question intrude into the domain of
what these persons are pleased to call “The
domain of politics,” is very striking. It
appears to be the conception of such make-
believe statesmen that their personal in-
terests, as politicians, are bound up in the
perpetuance of the existing system of confin-
ing the consideration of Parliaments to bogus
principles and sham issues. The old school
of New South W ales parliamentary repre-
sentatives have muddled along very comfort-
ably during a quarter of a century wasted in
trumpery debates about nothing in particular.
They have called upon the province at odd
times to decide whether Doodle should head
the Administration and save the community,
or whether Boodle should supplant Doodle
and “scatter plenty on a smiling land. ” Great
leaders and semi-great lieutenants have put
political soap in their mouths, and presented
themselves periodically before a credulous
country in an affected epilepsy of patriotic
agony lest something or other should happen
or should not happen. And gaping con-
stituencies, seeing them foam, and marking
their contortions, have actually allowed
themselves to be deluded into the idea that
these fits were genuine.
# # #
But, taking a retrospect coolly and de-
liberately, what has all the fuss of bygone
political convulsions been about ? It is past
the ingenuity of any man in New South
Wales to state concisely what have been the
essential differences between the alleged
“policies" of Cowpkr and Martin, of
Parker and Robertson. As regards the
two last-mentioned celebrities, after a dozen
years of the fiercest antagonism or rivalry,
it came to pass that they could not them-
selves distinguish wherein they had “dif-
fered ”so long. When it suited their own
convenience, they simply dropped all their
ridiculous pretence of distinctive policies,
and formed a coalition Cabinet the moment
they discovered that it had dawned upon
other politicians that they could play the
farce as well as either of the rivals, and
were under no serious obligation to stand
Uy while one of the two took his turn at the
distinctions and spoils of office. Who is
there, in all Australia, who can specifically
define the character of Parkes’ political
opinions ? Who can pronounce whether he
is Tory, Conservative, Liberal, or Radical ?
Similarly, with respect to Sir John Robert-
son, what ia he I Under what cognate
classification can Im be placed ? This train
of inquiry leads inevitably to the conclusion
that neither of these party leaders has ever
hampered himself with any specific policy.
Each alike has been a mere opportunist.
The smaller fry of alleged politicians—the
satellites which twinkled with derived and
secondary light in the system of each
of these luminaries—have exhibited a
similar nebulousness of political form. Thus
the history of Parliamentary affairs in New
South Wales has been a mere jumble of
personal aims and ambitions, as confusing as
the long rivalry in mediaeval Italy between
the Guelphs and the Ghibellines. The
whole business has been circumscribed to a
competition of adroit adaptability. He who
could best divine how the public could be
best cajollod and humbugged, came out top
for the nonce, losing his advantage and
supremacy only when his rival struck out
some device which he had overlooked.
# * *
This alternative of dexterous trifling
opened the sphere of public affairs to a gang
of men endowed with corresponding apti-
tudes. Plausible fellows with elastic con-
sciences and the art of making a mighty
bother about insignificant matters, experts
in the ignoble art of back-stair haunting,
and of petty intrigue with roads and bridges
and town pumps and post-office clocks for
their direct objects, secured the suffrages of
the electors. The great art of statesmanship
was to elude all serious or vital issues, to
strike imposing attitudes on accomplishing
the enactment of an oyster-Bill, and to make
orations replete with the loftiest sentiments
in relation to the reservation of roads for
travelling bullocks, or the best method of
facilitating, while feigning to curb, illegal
monopoly of land. Ceaselessly attitudinizing
on the stump and mouthing in the House,
with respect to such trumpery, that school of
pretended statesmen have generally concen-
trated such facilities as they actually
possessed upon turning to their own account
the opportunities afforded them by their
public station. They entered into active
business. Some became what they were
pleased to style “land-agents,” putting into
the market their influence with Ministers.
Others operated as forestallers. Availing
themselves of their early information with
respect to the opening or choice tracts of
land for sale or selection, in regard to the
probability of the early authorization of this
or that railway or other public work, they
made their arrangements with accomplices
and partners to be first in the field, and
often succeeded in picking the plums before
the ordinary public had time to make a
choice. Not every one succeeded in thus
enriching himself. But several did : and
few failed for lack of trying.
# # *
To men of this school of politicians there
is something positively terrible in the in-
auguration of an era when real living
principles shall come into play. It may
be urged that the fiscal question has already
compelled public men to take orders and to
declare allegiance to principles. This is
true to a certain extent. But already it has
become apparent that fiscal parties are not
very sharply defined, and that professions of
Protectionist or Freetrade proclivities sit
very lightly upon members for a number of
electorates. The fact is that in many parts of
the country the fiscal policy of the colony is
not regarded as a matter of vital concern, and
the Parliamentary representatives of such
electorates regard themselves as licensed to
put themselves up to auction by the rival
parties. On the Freetrade benches in the
Legislative Assembly sit several of the
earliest advocates of Protection. Mr. Jacob
Uakraiui, for example, was a striving
Protectionist light so long ago as 1881, when
he was one of the few youthful ones who
ventured to mount the platform to support
(1 hah am Beery when that Victorian Premier
gave, in Sydney Town Hall, a lecture or
address in favour of Protection. Mr. John
Sutherland, although an old professor of
Protection principles, did not find any
difficulty with his constituents when
he accepted office in a Freetrade ad-
ministration. Neither did Mr. Abigail
under identical circumstances. And, on the
other hand, Sir Henry Parkes’ chief oppon-
ents were rather driven or kicked by him
over to Protection than moved thither
voluntarily. Yet neither did they find any
difficulty with their constituents. The ex-
planation of this anomaly lies undoubtedly
in the fact that outside a compact body of
fiscal enthusiasts on both sides, the majority
of the public who constitute the two parties
take but a languid interest in a question of
which the results, beneficial or otherwise,
are not readily demonstrated, and in any
case operate in an indirect and roundabout
fashion.
# # *
Very different is the case with regard to
the Labour question. This comes home
directly to the consciousness of every man,
and, now that its importance is made
evident to the workers of Australasia,
it becomes instantly a vital subject to
which every other must bo subordi-
nated. When Labour is fairly launched into
the sphere of party politics, the entire tribe
of humbugs and shuffling impostors will be
thrown into confusion. A real, living issue,
permitting of no hesitation and no com-
promises, cannot fail to “confound their
politics” and “frustrate their knavish
tricks. ” Hence it is that we have the spec-
tacle of an Assembly which accepts with
gratitude and eager welcome the invitation
of MAlillan and Bruce Smith to observe a
strict neutrality, while the heart of the
people is beating with a throbbing impe-
tuosity of pulsation to which it has been
hitherto a stranger, and whilst these Minis-
feers themselves are secretly throwing the
full influence of the Government on the side
of that capitalist class to which they belong
and with which they sympathise. Hence it
was that members of the Assembly listened,
with blank dismay, to one member’s staunch
repudiation of this pretence of neutrality,
who, while declaring his own adhesion to the
cause of Labour, cast upon those who heard
him with unwilling ears the obligation of
making some corresponding or antagonistic
declaration. Hence it is that, on the night
when they were thus embarrassed, and on
the ensuing night when another member
thrust this subject upon their attention,
they skulked away in dismay, and twice
escaped discussion by “ counting out ” the
“ popular branch ” of the Legislature. Alas
for the old school of political trimmers and
tricksters ! Their ignominious scuttling will
not avail them. The Labour question is a
real issue, and has come to stay. Vainly
does the S.M. Herald exhort capitalists to
put pressure upon steamship-owners to come
to a compromise, l<‘*i the Labour question
should be carried into the domain of politics.
That question has already invaded that
domain, and not fifty Heralds can now
repulse it.
# # #
Political parties are already disjointed and
fractured by this irruption. One needs no
extra keenness of perception to appreciate
the fact that the New South Wales
Cabinet is shaken internally by the
necessity for a readjustment to meet the
new contingency. Sir Henry Parkes, true
to the opportunist practice of his whole
career, found it convenient to finesse and to
take up an attitude of observation, till he
can form a judgment as to which is likely to
be the stronger party in the State. Bruce
Smith and M‘Millan resent any paltering
with the accursed thing, Labour. In the
Freetrade ranks there is confusion and
dismay. The representatives of populous
centres, embarrassed by the divisions among
their chiefs, and still more by the changed
objects of their constituents, know not which
way to turn. They are smitten with dumb
confusion. Nor is the disorganisation among
the Protectionists in opposition much inferior.
The democratic section is active and resolute,
recognising the immense gain to their cause
which must accrue from the activity of
Trades-Unionism and from the more intense
examination of fiscal as well as social pro-
blems which must accrue from the existing
crisis. But the capitalist section, which
favoured Protection for pocket reasons, find
themselves suddenly thrust ‘ between the
Devil and the deep sea.” They know not
which way to turn. W. E. Abbott raves in
the newspapers. John See and Garvan
permit the Star to fulminate under their
directorate, against the Labour cause. The
squatting contingent, always more agrarian
than protectionist, preserves an uneasy
silence. Humbugs and pretenders on both
sides alike hear the rising voice of Labour
with much the same feeling as they would
the last trumpet. It proclaims to them the
day of judgment. The time for pretended
enthusiasms, for sham convictions, for con-
venient compliances has come to an end.
Public men have to open their secret
thoughts. The sheep must range themselves
aloof from the goats. The indulgent times
of “ what does it matter 1 ” have come to an
end.
« « •
The epoch of sham-fights is finished.
Henceforth real battles have to be fought.
The graceful hero of the blunted spear has
to show what sort of a nerve he has when
a steel point is levelled at his breast. It
is no longer the most dexterous sophist but
the sternest tighter, who will carry oft’ the
honours of each encounter. No longer can
the squadron’s form and reform, in
every varying constituents to wage mimic
war and emerge breathless, perhaps,
but unwounded. The combatants must
rally under one or two banners and stay
there, be the issue what it may, to endure
real blows from real weapons. Defeat may
involve destruction instead of being but a
prelude to a pageant. To abandon tropes,
the politician who elects now to oppose him-
self to the Unionist cause must confront the
certainty of having the mass of the prole-
tariat vote against him. He who, on the
other hand, feels bound to support the
claims of Labour must reckon upon the
vindictive animosity of the moneyed classes.
He must abandon all the pleasing prospects
of purses of sovereigns ; if embarassed, he
must reckon upon the utmost rigour of
Banks and creditors. If poor, none of his
political friends will be able to relieve his
transient needs with a timely loan. He
must reckon to be systematically depreciated
and maligned by the capitalist press, his
mistakes magnified, his principles misrepre-
sented, his utterances suppressed if effective,
and held up to derision if incidentally falla-
cious. Calumny and detraction will pursue
him like twin furies. Ruin will menace him
on one side and ridicule taunt him on the
other.
« # #
Under suen conditions, it is difficult to
determine what the unlucky, humbugging
politician of the old school is to do. He has
hitherto hoisted himself in by bamboozling
electors on the hustings with pretty pro-
mises, and then when elected not bothering
further, except when by any chance hard
pressed, to concoct some plausible fudge in
excuse ; that a situation which will impose
upon him the obligation of decisively break-
ing with one of two powerful sections of the
public, cannot fail to be productive of the
most excruciating bewilderment in his mind.
It is to be apprehended that this class will
have to abandon public life altogether.
This would, of course, be an exceeding
sacrifice—for the humbugs. But, all things
considered, it is just possible that the
province will be able to survive the afflicting
loss. Politics will cease to bo mere mumbling
of dead political creeds, and picking over
of dry bones. The community will be
moving in some direction. There will be
precipitate advances and scared reactions.
But who can doubt what the general tread
and direction will bo ? The condition of the
producers of wealth will be ameliorated.
But the way is long and rugged. Heretofore
it has been untravelled by foot of man. The
task imposed upon those to whom the duty
of leading shall be entrusted will be more
thankless and arduous than any hitherto
undertaken by men in like situation. They
will have need of greater powers and re-
source than any predecessors. They will
stand in need of more indulgence and will
receive less. There will be no fortunes, no
treasures, to be picked up by them by the
wayside, as there have been in the easier
routes travelled till now. Their yoke will
not be easy nor their burden light.
The Road to Affluence.
Ever since the world began to degrade itself by
the worship of industry it has been haunted by
the spectre of the ignoble fat man who has
sprung from the gutter, and who is in his own
person the emblem and embodiment of worldly
prosperity. There is a mould which Nature
reserves exclusively for this individual’s manu-
facture. He is large and coarse and pachyder-
matous. His origin was humble, and he
invariably started life with sixpence, but by
dint of unremitting toil he rose to stupendous
affluence ; and then he died and went to blazes
and left behind him a biography which cumbers
the shelves of innumerable libraries as a stand-
ing insult to posterity at large. The moral
which he bequeathes to the world is that
industry and economy are the sure and only
road to affluence, and in general the world
accepts the theory and passes it on to future
generations. The experience of centuries has
demonstrated that when a big, ponderous,
remorseless individual with a grasping soul is
prepared to tread down everybody who comes
in Ins way, he seldom fails to accumulate a
fortune, and therefore ungrammatical books
are written about the subject, and pallid, washy
tracts are perpetrated concerning it, and at
last mankind has accepted the fact that honest,
unremitting toil never fails to have its reward.
The earth is full of poverty, but tire Sunday-
school driveller recognises that industry, pro-
perly applied, is the one possible remedy for
the evil, and he is backed up by the parson who
snuffles in copy-book head-lines, and the city-
missionary, and all the rest of the great army
of piety and commonplace. There is misery
everywhere, but misery arises from improvid-
ence and want of energy, and lack of intelli-
gence. The biographies which are thrown per-
sistently at the heads of the coining race all
combine to teach the lesson that man, by dint
of toil and resolute purpose, can always conquer
fortune and become a mighty importer, or a
gigantic power in the salt-pork industry, and
die universally respected, and be shoved into
the grave without a single human being to
regret his loss, or to care where Ids soul has
gone to. And consequently the human race
bows down to industry, and when anyone is
hungry and discontented it wonders why he
doesn’t work and economise and grow rich in a
world where energy never fails to earn its
reward.
# # #
As the natural result the dull, commonplace
section of humanity—the section which groans
over the clammy bun at the Y.M.C.A. feed,
and which owns Property, and goes to Church
regularly, and reverences the old landmarks of
the Constitution —has resolved that Socialism is
the expression of an incurable desire on the
part of the class which never works to appro-
priate the accumulated industry of the respect-
able multitude. The typical Socialist is des-
cribed as an individual with long, superfluous
hair, and with a deposit of vegetable soil in his
finger-nails, whose life is divided between beer
and confiscation, and the preaching of riot; and
every man who is discontented with the present
condition of society is depicted as a public-house
loafer, who wears broken boots, and holds forth
upon anarchy in a bar. Capital has travelled
on this battered old gibe for ages, and it is still
in useful condition, and fit for many years of
service. For instance, the Brisbane Week,
probably the most abject specimen of journalism
extant, dishes up the ancient lie afresh in o
recent issue :
The theory of share and share alike is very fascinating'
to men who never would have anything three days after
pay day by any means or process than by appropriating
the fruits of other men’s active brains or busy habits. Bui
the process would be repeated eternally, and the distribu-
tion of one week would be followed by the redistribution
of the next week.
This evidently means if it means anything at
all -that the road to affluence is always open,
and that for active brains and industrious hands
thereiseverasurereward. And that,therefore,in
place of clamouring against capital and monopoly
it is the duty of humanity to labour cheerfully
and hopefully, that poverty may cease upon
the earth, and all the sons of Adam may become
capitalists, and earn the great prize that invari-
ably waits upon honourable toil.
# # #
Under these circumstances it is worth while
for man to inquire what he is striving for, and
it is depressing to learn that the total reward
of a life of toil is £72, In other words, the
total cash-value of the earth and all the pro-
perty, fixed and moveable, upon its surface
amounts to £72 to each inhabitant —that and
nothing more. There is no possibility of inde-
finite expansion, for the aggregate of humanity,
though it tdils unceasingly through the weary
cycle of its three score years and ten, can still
own the earth and nothing more. It owned the


earth at the beginning, and it will own the
same solitary asset to the end, and if industry
and intelligence become universal virtues, and
fraud and greed and injustice are abolished
together, the best result will he that each
worker will get his just share of the earth and
of such wealth as it has to give. The riches of
the world increase only in a certain limited
ratio, and beyond that limit industry is merely
an aimless process by which man digs a useless
hole and then fills it up again. The production
of gold may increase, hut as it increases its
purchasing power diminishes, and if there were
but one solitary sovereign in all the five con-
tinents the human race would be practically as
rich as it is to-day. The land which is devoted
to agriculture is of infinitely greater value than
the same land in its unimproved state ; hut the
world cannot grow suddenly and violently rich
by turning all the desert of the earth into a
garden. The value of the garden is ganged by
the value of its produce, and any produce
in excess of what the world can buy and
use has no value at all, while the land
on which it is grown is equally at a dis-
count. Every city that is established makes
the world richer, but still the world cannot rise to
universal affluence by the immediate and whole-
sale construction of cities. A city is merely
an aggregation of buildings and inhabitants,
together with the soil which they both occupy.
The soil gains its inflated estimation only when
the inhabitants multiply, and if the accumulated
ground-rents of London arc divided among the
four and a-half million residents by whose
presence they are created, then the individual
value of the city is no more than that of the
prairie. And as for the buildings, in an era of
absolute equality all that each citizen can do
is to own his own residence, and his share in
the public structures which are possessed jointly
by the community. Riches cannot he multi-
plied by the erection of tenements which no
one needs and no one occupies, nor by the con-
struction of ships beyond the requirements of
commerce, nor by the formation of railways
except where population renders them necessary
and profitable, and, consequently, the scope of
industry is limited to the supply of the world’s
necessities. Beyond that the boasted road to
affluence is barred, and for the present the
prospects of humanity are limited to the afore-
said sum of £72, and until the more equal dis-
tribution of wealth enables the mass of humanity
to own better houses and to purchase better
furniture and better clothing, the prospects of
industry are not likely to grow much brighter.
The capitalist employs the workman to manu-
facture only what the world can afford to buy
and own, and until the world can afford to own
more wealth, production will undergo no great
or indefinite expansion. It increases as popula-
tion increases, and that is about all.
# # •
Consequently the old moral wheeze breaks
down. The world’s population may practise
the melancholy virtue of industry until the
millennium, but they cannot own more than the
earth and its contents, and there is not enough
eartli and contents to go round. Toil does not
necessarily result in affluence, for the world can
only afford to pay for such toil as is actually
useful, and anything beyond that is super-
fluous and adds no more to the aggregate
wealth than the labour of dragging a stone up-
hill, and then rolling it down again. In the
biography of the fat and self-satisfied in-
dividual who accumulated an immense fortune
and left a lofty example behind him, it is
generally narrated that in his youth he rose
early and toiled like a galley-slave from dawn
to dark, but that merely demonstrates that he
stole some one else’s chance of employment in
addition to his own, for all the employment in
the Avorld would probably give no more than
four hours’ work per diem to each inhabitant.
Also he laid the foundations of his fortune by
living cheaply on bread and vegetables in a
hovel, and when the rest of the world follows
the example thus set, every trade and occupa-
tion will collapse through the universal
stoppage of consumption, and industry will
perish because there will be nothing to be in-
dustrious about, and the law of supply and
demand will die out because the supply will be
unlimited and the demand nil, and universal
economy, instead of leading to affluence, will
end in universal beggary. The hollow gag
that energy and enterprise are the sure road to
prosperity virtually means that life is a race in
which every competitor ought to come in first,
and nobody is to be in the rear.
# # #
Every monopolist, whether his wealth is
acquired by means which mankind describes as
honest, or is gained by open fraud, has risen by
treading down his fellows, and by consigning
other men to hopeless poverty, or more often to
absolute starvation. He is a financial cannibal,
and his gold is stained with murder, and the
stones of his mansion cemented with human
blood and human agony. His position, at the
best, is that of a lucky member of a castaway
crew, who has gambled with his companions in
misery for the scanty stock of food and Avater
which stands between them and death, and has
won the game ; and at the worst his situation is
that of the marooned seaman who kills and eats
his fellow sufferers. He is the brainy specu-
lator in a beleaguered city who, in the pursuit
of a just and honourable calling, buys up the
entire available supplies and makes a profitable
trade out of the horrors of famine, and grows
rich upon anguish and woe, and accumulated
wretchedness. The monopolist, like the man-
eating tiger, feeds on humanity at large, and
though both he and the tiger may he estimable
animals in private life, their existence is equally
a menace to society, and the evils which they
invoke can only he remedied by their ex-
tinction,
• # #
The prosperity ot a nation, under the un-
natural conditions of modern civilisation, is
merely the prosperity of an infinitesimal
fraction of its inhabitants. England and
America, are to-day the two richest states upon
the earth; Egypt and Siberia arc among the
poorest ; yet the fellah who labours in the
cornfields beside the Nile, and the moujik who
" ve ts a precarious existence from the dreary
stenpes ot the Lena, enjoy as much affluence
and have as bright a prospect for the future as
the citizen whose lot is cast in St. or
among the dreary slums beside the East
River. Britain is wealthy in millionaires
and palaces, but the bulk of her toiling
multitudes might change places with the Indian
who fishes in the Jnruay or the Tocantins, and
lose nothing by the transaction.. And for the
great mass of humanity there is no hope of
alleviation anywhere between the cradle and
the grave. For them the boasted virtue of,
industry is merely a process by which man
swims desperately on the surface of a shoreless
sea in search of a harbour ; it is as purposeless
as the attempt to grow corn upon the ocean, or
to raise green foliage in a burning furnace. The
resources of the world are sufficient to maintain
all its inhabitants in comfort under equitable
conditions, but when land-owners, capitalists,
monarchs, and all the rest of the human car-
nivora who neither toil nor spin have plundered
its fields there is not enough to go round, and
for every financial magnate who leaves his foot-
print on the sands of time some score of
unknown outcasts must die of hunger in the
gutter to restore the balance. The hoary lie
that honest industry is a certain path to afflu-
ence has had its day. The most that the
average toiler can hope for is to get his fair
share of the earth and all its wealth, and the
sum total of that share is £72; And when the
capitalist in his \ r arious forms has taken two-
thirds of this amount—how much remains ?
# # *
Therefore there is a curse on the accumulated
millions of the rich, and the gates of heaven—
if a hnaAmn there be—are justly closed upon the
capitalist. The man who acquires a huge pile
of gold by honest means is no more guiltless
than the man who honestly acquires possession
of his fellow-creatures, and holds them in per-
sonal slavery. The great manufacturer who
swallows up liis smaller competitors by
honourable devices is in the same category with
the Arab dealer who raids a peaceful village
beside Nyanza, and trades off his human spoils
in the markets of Zanzibar or Khartoum.
Providence has gifted the one vampire with in-
telligence, and the other with animal courage,
and each uses his powers for the undoing
of his fellow-creatures. The respected
Christian speculator who ruins other men
by a successful operation on the Stock
Exchange stands on the same level as the
Dacoit who is hanged in vindication of an
outraged law ; and the Pindaree and the Thug
are brothers of the same family. They are all
assassins, achieving the same end by different
means, and the blood of the dead adheres
equally to the plunder which the brigand brings
home after a successful raid, and to the dollars
and cents which go to pay the salary of the
wealthy bishop and the fashionable preacher.
The cannibal of the pulpit and the cannibal of
the forest are very much alike at the best—they
both live directly or indirectly on their fellow-
men, and the sinner who eats his victim cooked
accepts no heavier responsibility than the saint
who eats his raw.
A Sample of Judicial Logic.
Last week in the N.S.W. Central Criminal
Court, before Mr. Justice Windeyer, Charles
Hunter, convicted on two separate charges
of criminally assaulting his daughters, aged
respectively twelve and ten years, was not
formally sentenced to death, but had merely
sentence of death recorded against him. In
explanation of this, the Judge stated that,
terrible as the offence was, it appeared to him
utterly improbable, considering the after-
results, that the death-penalty would be carried
out. It would perhaps be a lasting misery to
the unhappy child to know that her father was
brought to the scaffold through her evidence.
Abominable as was Hunter’s crime, it was
therefore not his Honor’s intention to pro-
nounce sentence of death. It was at
all times a shock to a judge to pass
; a death - sentence, and he would never
do so unless he saw there reasonable
ground to believe that it would be carried out.
Moreover, in the opinion of his Honor, no one
would cause the prisoner to he hanged upon the
evidence of his own daughter, not out of con-
sideration for the prisoner but out of considera-
tion for his unhappy child, who might in after
years be reproached with the fact that she had
brought her father to the scaffold. Wrong
enough, said the judge, had been done her
without that. In the first case the death-sen-
tence would be recorded ; in the second case the
sentence would be penal servitude for fourteen
years on the first and second counts and ten
years on the third count, the sentences to be
concurrent.
# * *
Into this case Judge Windeyer (from a legal
point of Anew, illogically) inserts the thin end
of the wedge of sentiment. How far is he pre-
pared to go ? The crimes of which Hunter
stands convicted are, it need not be demon-
strated, far more wicked than rape, from both
a moral and physical standpoint ; yet out of a
sentimental consideration for his children’s feel-
ings be is to escape from the punishment fixed
by the code. Is this not an absolutely dangerous
element to introduce ink the demesne of
justice ? Would a judge he justified in lightening
the sentence of a violator who was guilty of
rape on his own sister? Had each of the Mount
Rennie offenders, instead of assaulting a social
outcast, violated his own sister, they ivould all,
according to the judge’s present dictum, be now
imprisoned under a fourteen years’ sentence
* * #
Yet, if sentiment of this kind is introduced
into the administration of justice, Avhere is the
line to he drawn ? If the punishment is to he
ameliorated on account of its extending or over-
lapping upon the lives of the innocent relatives,
how is it possible to hang anyone who is not
absolutely alone in the world ? When you
hang a man you socially hang his family. When
you hang a man you hang the mother avlio bore
him, his father, his brothers, his sisters, his
wife, his children—even the friends whose in-
terest in him stops not short at the gaol-door.
If the family of any offender are to be thus con-
sidered as participators in a man’s punishment,
they must also be, from the other side, account-
able for his actions. Yet the whole trend of
nineteenth-century ideas seems to be in an
opposite direction, for science declares the
criminal to he, not a development, but a thi’ow-
hack. But once allow sentiment to enter into
this question, the definitions of science become
absurd !
# # *
We might, however, go deeper than this, and,
quitting altogether the hackneyed ground of
cheap sentiment, plunge into the question
purely from the scientific side of it. The man
who commits incest with his little daughters
must, from a scientific point of view, be rather
a subject for medical than hempen treatment.
The idea of incest is in itself absolutely brutal
and repellant and altogether outside of the
possibility of committal by a man possessing a
normal and sane mind. It is in itself proof posi-
tive and imperative proof of some neurotic com-
plaint which, -being organic and not moral in its
origin, is hardly a case for treatment by Jack
Ketch. If the responsibility of fatherhood
itself is no preservative, if the idea of incest is
not in itself awfully and disgustingly repellant,
we ask, in the name of all human progress and
progressive science, how the gallows can be a
preventive ? And to prevent is now recognised
by all the advanced minds of the age to he the
desideratum. We are slowly leaving behind us
the age of punishment and its ridiculous blun-
ders. The researches of Lombroso, and the
practical application of scientific theory by Dr.
Wey, of Elmira, discount at once and for ever
all the mediaeval bunkum of the dogmatic puni-
tory systems of the past. We have entered a
new era, but centuries will probably elapse
before pur legislative and administrative autho-
rities catch up to it.
-* * *
The only way to’ approach this question of
crime and punishment is undoubtedly from its
scientific side. The question of sentimental
consideration must not for a moment be allowed
to enter into it. A cool consideration of another
case, tried only a few days ago by the same
Mr. Justice Windeyer, will convince any im-
partial man that it is becoming an almost
invariable rule to consider a case from the point
of view of purely personal sentiment. We
allude to the case of Frewin and Jamieson.
The latter shot at his wife’s seducer, who was
living with her while obtaining money from the
injured husband for the purpose of bringing
about a reconciliation. The jury brought in a
verdict of “Not Guilty,” on the ground of
temporary insanity. Purely a matter of senti-
ment, for each juryman looked at Jamieson’s
case from the possibility of his own future
experience. Had Mrs. Jamieson, instead of
being her husband’s wife, been her, husband’s
mistress, what an outcry would have been
raised against the “brutal scoundrel” who at-
tempted to kill a man who had as much “right”
to the person of a woman as he had himself!
This, in turn, would have been purely a matter
of sentiment. Jamieson would have suffered
to the utmost penalty of the law, simply
because he lacked the authorised hill-of-sale
by which a woman becomes the property of a
man.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Dogberry of the Bush.
Fob some reason, which is never openly ex-
plained, no workman or man without capital is
ever made a J.P. in any of the Australias. The
average official docs not illustrate the fact that
brains are essential for the administration of
justice, for the average J.P. has no bi’ains, and
he does not always administer justice. More,
over, most men with brains live and die poor,
and are therefore not eligible for the billet. A
man who is big and coarse and remorseless
and hopelessly pachydermatous, and who is
gifted in addition with that grasping acquisitive-
ness which distinguishes the monkey out in
search of cocoa-nuts, seldom fails to make a pile
and rise to the dignity of the Bench, but the
species of intelligence by which he is dis-
tinguished is niore worthy of an ourang-outang
than a human being. The faculty of making
money is the lowest of animal propensities, and
as a consequence the administration of Aus-
tralian law is entrusted to a dull, sodden,
heavy-jowled, fat-livered race, who know less
and know it worse than almost any other
section of the community. This class runs the
entire show on its own account, and when any
legal question arises in which the rich and the
poor take opposite sides capital occupies the
bench all by itself, and appears before itself,
and pleads before itself, and decides in its own
favour with costs. To hire a jury of twelve
howling Orangemen to try Parnell, or
empannel a dozen dynamiters to bring
in a verdict against an Irish landlord,
would be no greater outrage than this astound-
ing system.; and if Mary Jane Hicks were
appointed to hear an appeal on behalf of the
Mount Rennie convicts, the proceedings would
be just a shade less unreasonable. The decision,
unanimously arrived at by a dozen separate
gangs of justices in various parts of New South
Wales, that a shearer who leaves his job is a
criminal and is to be treated as such, regardless
of the fact that the shearer’s agreement with
his employer grants him the power to retire
•whenever it suits him to do so, is a fair sample
of law as administered by the amateur Scroggs
of the back-blocks. The one thing that is
wanted to complete the picture is to find a
bench of magistrates which will fine or im-
prison the squatter who sacks a shearer without
notice, but when this phenomenon will turn up
no one knows. According to the rules accepted
by both sides, either party may terminate the
contract at pleasure, but the capitalist, when
he appears before himself to argue Ins own
cause and decide unanimously that the other
party is always wrong, rises superior to such
insignificant considerations. The Dogberry of
the "bush is an unmitigated failure. He has
neither sense nor moral decency, and if the
J.P, of the far interior can’t be entirely
abolished, it is necessary that he should be
toned down by admixture with some other
element which is partly human, instead of
mere incarnate money-bag. The system by
which every rich man in the community is
allowed to rush to the Bench, and pass a long
sentence on every poor man whom he dislikes
or objects to, is played out.
A Prophet with an Eyeglass.
I’n at imported Labour advocate, Mr. H. H.
( 'kami'ion, has been tried and found a failure.
As an advocate of the cause of Capital he would,
no doubt, )>e a conspicuous success, but that is
only qualified praise —if an animal professes to
be a racehorse it is but a dubious honour to
state that it might make a reasonably good
cow. The objection which Labour has to urge
against this officious and self-appointed prophet
is simply that from first to last he has urged
unconditional surrender, and the acceptance of
terms which would make Labour the hopeless
slave of Capital; and the Employers’ League, in
its most rampant mood, could do no more. With
a Christian courtesy which is beyoud all praise,
he proposes to sacrifice all his friends in the
sacred cause of peace, and as his eye-glase, and
his dress-suit, and his bank-account, and the
exotic plant in his button-hole, will all survive
the" general carnage, lie is able to bear up
against the prospective wreck of his party, and
to help it on, with considerable fortitude. The
one condition which involves the irredeemable
destruction of Unionism is that by which the
employers stipulate that in future unionists and
non-unionists are to he employed indis-
criminately and to work together on equal
terms, and this condition Mr. Champion is
prepared to accept with the unobtrusive cheer-
fulness of a man who is giving away someone
else in a great cause. The unionist has paid
the cost of the great campaign, which has been
carried on for years to bring about the elevation
of the masses, and the one element of cohesion
in the ranks of Labour is the consciousness that
each man must do his share in the work if he
wishes to enjoy the resulting advantages.
All the privileges which the Australian
worker enjoys in comparison with the miserable
toilers of less fortunate lands have been gained
by Unionism, and the strength of the movement
lias been the fact that every individual must
take a share in the struggle as well as in the
victory. But if the unionist is required to prop
up the cause of the blackleg as well as his own,
then the league must collapse like an inverted
pyramid with its base in the air. If a mere
section of the working class is to maintain the
rights of the whole body at its own cost, then
every worker will endeavour to belong to the
party which takes none of the risk and an equal
share of the gains. What the so-called “free
labourer ” demands is that he shall be allowed
to abuse the unionist to an unlimited extent;
that he shall also he allowed to usurp his place
whenever an industrial crisis gives him an
opportunity to do so ; and, finally, that in the
event of the crisis terminating in a victory for
Labour, that he shall have an equal or greater
share of the advantages which ensue. He is
paid to fight against Labour, and yet Labour is
to divide the return with its enemy. The
State requires that every citizen should contri-
bute towards the defence of the nation, whether
he desires that the nation should be defended or
not, and in like manner the Labour party—a
state within a state—demands that all who live
by its protection should bear a due proportion of
the cost of the general defence. The employers
device, however, is to construct an anomalous
commonwealth in which three-fourths of the
members shall demand to be protected at
the exclusive cost of the other fourth,
and shall also take pay from the enemy
and fight against their own defenders ; and
Mr. Champion, as the friend of the unions,
demands that they shall acquiesce in these con-
ditions. A house divided against itself is
inevitably doomed, and if Labour is ever to he
hopelessly enslaved in Australia, the capitalists,
and the prophet with the eye-glass and the dress-
suit, have managed between them to discover
the most hopeful means for the achievement of
that object. Asa rampant Conservative and a
man who howls in defence of Property Mr.
Champion has many good points, but as a social
reformer he has some conspicuous disadvantages.
The eye-glass and the dress-suit have eaten into
his soul, and cannot be eradicated.
A Bishop on Property.
That reverend father of the Church, Bishop
Goe, of Melbourne, has struck an altogether
new patch in defence of Property, and for the
suppression of Socialism; and the Christian
who has made a pile is much gratified thereby.
The Gon of Israel, it seems, has got His eye on
the nefarious gang who want the land to belong
to the people, and when the eighth command-
ment was advertised on Sinai, it was intended
as a manifesto in favour of landlordism, and
wealth in general. The utterance, “ Thou
shalt not steal,” according to Goe, pre-supposes
the lawfulness of private property, for not only
does it forbid anybody to take the land from
the landlord, but it asserts that it is right for
him to possess it, else it could not be stolen
from him. It is impossible to steal from any
man what he hasn’t got, and no decalogue
would be such an ass as to prohibit stealing
where there was nothing to embezzle; con-
sequently the commandment practically declares
that the landlord should have the land in the
first place, and should be allowed to stick to it
in the second. In short, Goe, having presum-
ably got the tip from’ Providence, is in
a position to state that the Scripture does
not prohibit the landlord stealing the land from
the people; it only prohibits the people stealing
it back again. It has no reference to the great
original fraud by which mankind in general was
swindled of its common property, it is merely
intended to forbid mankind recovering the
rights which have been stolen from it. The
divine mandate by which it i« declared unlaw-
ful to covet the ass of the man next door, takes
no notice of the fact that the man next door
may have stolen tine ass in the first place, and
that the other man—the one who covets it—
may be the individual from whom it was taken ;
it merely recognises the bald fact that one
person has got an ass—it doesn’t matter how,
and should be allowed to keep it according to
the sacred laws of Property. It is refreshing
to have these matters explained, but it occurs


James Carlyle, brother of the cynical
philosopher and historian of Chelsea, died the
other day in London. His obituary notice states
that he was “the greatest living authority on
small wood and house vermin,” which means, we
presume, that he was acquainted with rats and
blackbeetles, and was well up in cockroaches.

to us, somehow, that Goe has explained alto-
gether too much. The commandment, “ Thou
shaft not kill,” for instance, might be worked
the same way with disastrous results, for some-
body might chance to brain Goe with an axe,
and as the divine word forbids that he should
be killed in his turn, whether he has brained
Goe or not, it might seem like a direct incite-
ment to the murder of a well-meaning but
somewhat incoherent bishop whose mangled
remains would probably excite unpleasant com-
ment. Therefore we would urge Goe and all
his tribe to give up making a melancholy
spectacle of themselves by fooling with a com-
mandment which has pulled through pretty
well for several thousand years without their
assistance, and which seems to be still in good
health and capable of getting along by its own
efforts. Also we would invite attention to
another divine utterance which states that
“ The earth is the Lord’s,” and ask if it
doesn’t occur, even to Goe, that the men whose
pretensions he advocates so vigorously have
been jumping the Lord’s claim, in a manner of
speaking, and breaking up a great ordinance
which has been a good deal neglected ?
Died of Hunger.
In London, during the year 1889, twenty-seven
deaths were recorded from starvation. That is
to say there were twenty-seven deaths directly
and unmistakeably attributable to starvation,
but the fatalities from diseases arising out of
hunger and misery, and the suicides whose sole
motive was destitution, might be reckoned by
thousands and thousands. Nobody seemed to
be much excited, however, by these incidents.
The black-coated man of God was away at some
ponderous feed given by the boss sweater and
the publican ; and the philanthropist was out
collecting subscriptions to hire a fat hypocrite
that would preach to and shoot at some lost
tribe in the Great Desert. The private Christian
was propping up the sanctity of the Sabbath,
or else was busy looking after his own mean
little soul; and the Good Samaritan with the
bald head and the red nose was harassing the
poor for coppers, to make up a testimonial to
the Good Samaritan with the watery eye and
red ear; and the fashionable curate was acting
as dry-nurse to somebody’s poodle ; and the
little, round, fat, oily man of God was engaged
in drawing up a report about the spread of the
Gospel. And as the twenty-seven victims died
quietly, and made no offensive fuss, their exit
attracted little observation. If each one of
them had spent his last energies in bouncing a
jagged brick off the shiny cranium of a fatted
landlord the circumstances would at least have
drawn some attention to their fate, and excited
a certain amount of unhealthy comment, and
however illogical the action might have been
the actor would have left the seeds of a great
reform behind him. It does not answer to be
at all times too severely logical. A few months ago
a French inventor fired a gun at the President
“ in order to call attention to anew mode of
stuffing mattresses,” and the experiment was
eminently successful, for both the operator and
his patent received attention forthwith. And
when every other method of demonstrating the
miserable condition of the poor has failed, it
might be worth while to try if a soft but heavy
missile aimed at the monopolist would lead to a
national awakening.
Here is one of the most brazen-faced actions,
on the employers’ side, we have yet met with
during the course of the strike. It occurred at
a meeting of the S.A. Brewing Company the
other day;—
The Hon. W, K. Simms said that the branch establish-
ment at Broken Hill was rapidly extending its operations.
The product was growing very popular with the people
there, and the profits accruing from that branch were of a
very much better character than they were in Adelaide.
When the strike took place there were rumours that some
of the directors of the company, more particularly the
chairman and himself, were sympathising strongly with
the employers against the Union. Had that feeling got
abroad to any extent it would have been injurious to their
trade. He had explained to him what was meant by the
word boycott, and he was afraid that the meaning of that
word might have been applied to them. The directors
were anxious that it should be understood that they did
not want to have any feeling in the matter, but wanted
to remain neutral, and were anxious that nothing should
take place to mar the friendship between them and the
miners. They thought that the best way to get rid of
this feeling and to show that their feeling-in the matter
was neutral (?) was to give £25 towards the funds of the
Union. (!!!!!!)
The Hon. N. Fitzgerald said he would do everything in
the interests of the company which he thought would
secure or consolidate their business in Broken Hill He
would be either on one side or the other, neutral or sitting
on a rail, or anything he thought might lead to the
popularity of their beer and the interests of the company,
and if £25 was a good investment he would have given it
and felt that instead of having the displeasure of the
shareholders he would have received a hearty vote of
thanks.
All of which serves to remind us that Brewer
Toohey, of Sydney, has given £2OO to the
strikers, and that Tooth and Cos. (capital, one
million sterling) are so determined not to let
Toohey have things all his own way that they
have publicly announced their intention only to
employ Union labour.
The Australian daily press, instead of leaving
such works to the police, has already begun to
prosecute and grossly prejudice the case of Peter
Hansen, the Daneaccused of murderingCiiAßLES
Duncker near Peak Hill. The Crown, as repre-
sented by successive New South Wales Govern-
ments, has for long behaved most shamefully to
penniless prisoners. One might imagine that,
pist as the State would, if necessary, spend
thousands to effectively prosecute an alleged
murderer, it would also spend thousands, in
due season, to provide efficient counsel for a
possibly blameless prisoner on trial for his life.
But, no—the whole duty of the Government,
police, and press is apparently to hound down
and libel an accused man—and to keep that
man under lock-and-key and unprovided with
defence until the very last moment. Should
this continue any longer, The Bulletin will
head a subscription-list for the purpose of pro-
viding counsel in proper time for every moneyless
citizen accused of capital crime. The Bulletin
directs the attention of \ttorney-General
Simpson and Mr. Bruce Smith, the two
barristers of the present New South Wales
Government, to the fact that a man was last
week tried at Sydney upon two capital charges,
in cespect ,to one of which he was altogether
ufidereifaed.
[?]
846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney, October 16,1890.
My Dear Moorabinda,—
The October number of Weigel’s Fashion Journal quite
supports your Sappho’s complaint that there are no
spring novelties whatever. According to this authority
of those ladies who construct strange garments from soft
tissue “ shapes ” sealed up in paper bags—sailor-hats >
shirts and jackets will be even more pronounced and
numerous than before, and basques (“ Jersey ” basques—
what has become of the Carington collar?) of white mull
and batiste will have it all their own way. The basque is
a tricky addition, only to be safely worn by the woman
whose waist isn’t long enough for her height, for it
lengthens the top end of the figure dreadfully, and she of
shorter supports and a basque bound about her is
reminiscent of the Irish hero who wore his two legs down
to the knees. Sleeves may be a shrieking contrast with
the gown (mauve and green, for instance) and white
sleeves for sombre cottons will be regarded favourably by
the laundress, who views dark summer dresses with a
jaundiced opinion.
A fashion which has come with the spring is three small
frills at the wide end of your garment, and in the face of
this mixed evil I feel called upon to implore the lady who
is constructed on a 6 x 4 principle not to put them on the
rear-end of her draperies unless she gasps to look like St.
John’s head on a charger. Three small frills look harm-
less enough on the hour-glass beauties of the fashion*
diagrams, but on the lady who has grown horizontal
they are more desperate than rainbow-stripes.
Have you heard of the latest local trick for getting up
impromptu dances? Several—if not all—of the male guests
write politely to the hostess, asking if it will be convenient
for them to pay their duty-call en masse on such and such
an evening ? and the hostess generally weakly says that
it will. Nothing then remains but to invite a posse of
girls to keep the invaders amused, and when that is done,
dancing suggests itself as the simplest way to run the
entertainment. Refreshments follow, as a matter of
course, and thus is the unsuspicious chatelaine beguiled
into presiding over another affair before she is really
aware of it. This last social development is a lot worse
than the anathematised “ surprise’’-party, to which the
guests did at least bring their own victuals.
Under vice-regal patronage the first Patey concert in
Sydney Centennial Hall was a well-attended function per-
vaded by a small yellow dog, which was always in a con-
spicuous position, chasing its tail when the melodies were
pianissimo and pathetic, and whose irritated yap helped
to swell the applause accorded the baritone-voiced
artiste. Lady Carington (who arrived at half-time) wore
pale-pink striped silk cut V-shaped with a fichu of white
lace, diamond ornaments and white roses in the hair,
cloak of accordeon-pleated chiffon in pink and moss-green
with high yoke collar of moss-green velvet, and Lord
Carington sat in a studied attitude with a white vest on-
Madame Patey—in a gown of pale-blue brocade with a
full train, the front draped in net designed in gold
threads, folds of blue chiffon on bodice, and sleevelets o*
chiffon, diamond ornaments, and pale-blue shoes-was in
superb voice as usual. Miss Rossow—who holds her
music as if it wanted to bite her—wore a dress of
pale-blue silk and white brocade, with panel of white
lace, and received a clamorous recall fora waltz-song, and
Miss Naylor, in shell-pink silk and Maltese lace, accom-
panied most soulfully. The usual floral compliments
were paid to Madame Patey, and one or two enthusiast 3
threw their buttonholers on to the platform at the con*
elusion of the “Soots Wha Hae.”
The very latest sensation in connection with a some-
what notable "engagement” is, that the fair bride-
expectant is “ not all there in her upper storey,” as the
bad little boys say. She was previously engaged to a
swain who was killed in her presence, and this shock very
naturally turned her brain. She recovered eventually,
and was thought completely cured when the approaching
wedding-day, with all its memories, proved too much for
her mentally. The question now is—when will the
marriage take place ?
“The Long Strike ” drama at Her Majesty’s is full of
thrill and sob and courting. The amount of novelty
infused by Watts-Phillips (Jane Learoyd) into each flood
of tears, and the original light in which she showed up
the same old grief act after act made the overwhelmed
creature a welcome feature of the trouble. There is no
dressing at all during the long strike, but the combination
of brown, green, and terra-cotta worn by the heroine is
very artistic in effect, while the glittering starch on
Greenaway’s collar shows what good terms he must be on
with his washer-lady.
They train them gently in the “opening" business, it
seems, before they are sent out, for it is telegraphed that
“ the Earl of Jersey opened a barn at Carndon, Bucks.’
Probably they begin at home with tinned fish and a few
appropriate remarks written large on a blackboard in
front of them while the family sit round to inspire con-
fidence. It’s so easy to learn how to be a Governor !
Women are not all the confiding, romantic darlings
erroneously supposed by some people—it is only the
exceptional woman who flies with the undesirable party
against the promptings of social interest. For instance,
a member of an Australian ladies’ club (not to put too
fine a point upon it) rose bashfully in her place recently
and was understood to incoherently request information
as to whether a spinster member, in marrying an indivi-
dual not strictly in her world, would be thrown out of the
club on account of the absence of polish and gilt about
the happy husband. The committee was flabbergasted,
and after a flurried silence was understood to remark that
"in view of the painful circumstances—er—application
for membership must be made again under the new
namS ” And th'« enquirer dropped heavily bVck into her
chair under the blighting stare of the entire club, who
thirsted to discover whether she meditated eloping with
a scavenger, or if she hadn’t already done it?
It is original to speak of a bridegroom’s trousseau, and
I don’t suppose ever anybody reflects that a man has to
hang about his tailor’s and war with his haberdasher just
as much as his bride has to submit to having pins run into
her at the frockists’; lam certain that absolutely nobody
ever enters into the feelings of a bridegroom as to his ap*
pearance at the altar when he is expending money over
the latest cuts in coats, and been hours selecting the
pattern of his pants, lie is contemptuously regarded a 3
a being who has clothed himself anyhow, as a rule, and
even his staunchest mate only tells him that he looks
beastly nervous, and never mentions reassuringly that
the coat sets off his spinal curve immensely, or that his
continuations are most artistic. No matter how much he
has paid to look smart he is always ignored from a tailor’s
point of view, while his bride, costing much less per
yard than he does very often, is followed up the aisle with
admiration. What an adorable being that girl would
seem who would whisper to the crushed individual
timidly awaiting her magnificence before the altar:
“ You’ve no idea, my darling, what a good fit your vest
is 1”
At Rosehill race-meeting on 11th, the parterres were
covered with superb roses of very rare varieties, forget-
me-nots, camellias and so on. There was a crowded
attendance, and a number of ladies came out in cool
delaines, relieved with silk and floral hats, which attire
looked very pretty on the green and shady course.
A good way to crush the greedy and pernicious custom
which crams more song into every evening than the
average person’s ear can carry at a sitting, is for the
victim to come back and twitter the concluding strains
of the melody first contributed. The encore-hungry
always bang their hollow palms for a novelty, and the
classic recitative is howled after in the hope that a senti-
mental ballad or serio-comic song will be the reward of
their persistency. Encores originally meant the same
thing over again, but that isn’t the game at present.
The last Centenary-hall Patey concert on 9th inst. (the
final efforts are to eventuate in the Centennial Hall) was
graced by a good crowd, mostly decolletS, in the front
seats. The wise girl always wears full dress to a concert,
for the lights are never lowered at those vocal orgies, and
your rags and your riches are shown up all the time as
they never are in dim-lit theatres. Madame Patey, who
was much bediamonded, wore a toilette in eau-de-nil silk
brocaded in gold, the draperies lined with pale-pink silk)
the underskirt finished with three little green-and-pink
frills, folds of green chiffon on the bodice, ending in a
bow and streamers of green ribbon on the left hip ; the
hair done A la tea-pot, and bound about with what looked
like a yard of tape, a gold dagger contributing greatly to
the back view. She received many flowers, and the
audience encored every item and doubled the three
billed ballads, and came down with hoofs and hands and
umbrellas on top of a quivering, soft last note in a manner
that must have delighted the gifted artiste from “ ’Ome.’’
The excitement of a very flat week was the installation
and enthronement of William S. Smith, Bishop of Sydney,
which took place at St. Andrew’s Cathedral on 9th inst.,
in the*presenoe of Lady Carington (in pink and fawn and
saffron roses) and a jam-crowded edifice. Just behind the
vice-regal pew the Primate’s sister was seated, having
with her the Misses Mabel and Snowden Smith and Mr.
Hubert Smith-all wearing deep mourning. The Bishop’s
daughters have childish features and fair hair done up
Into neat little polished knobs, and were simply dressed
in black skirts and jackets, with flat straw hats and bows
of ribbon in front. The ceremonies were of an impressive
character generally, but it was a pity the procession, of
clergy up the aisle was so happy-go-lucky in appearance,
for the elongated teller of glad tidings had been recklessly
paired with the wide abbreviated shepherd, while the
stray pilot of famished outline was allowed to stalk in the
company of the waddling, overfed divine to the detriment
of the mise en seine. The long, wearisome programme
was chanted and intoned and prayed and exhorted
through without a hitch, and one had lots of time
to grasp that Bishop Smith is a tall, fine personage
with a killing profile (something like John L. Toole seen
sideways in a supremely conservative moment). The
“kinfreedrel” was specially beautified with flowers for the
occasion—the lantern being bound round and round with
a garland of many-coloured roses, moss and westeria, but
I regret to say that the little efforts of the perspiring
choir fell a long way short of heavenly music—warring
with the fortissimo organ, they produced the effect of a
band of distressed infants crying in a boiler-factory.
Speaking of the sacred ceremony, as Lady Carington
sat sedately in her pew, a rusty lady, closely
followed by another effusive worshipper, flounced boldly
into the vice-regal enclosure, banged herself down close
at the vice-regal elbow, and planted two dusty feet upon
the same sacred hassock whereon Lady C. was resting her
heels on. A glance from the gubernatorial eye brought
the feet off the hassock in a twinkling, but a little uncere-

A pupil of Madame Charbonnet-Kellermann (Miss Sum-
merbelle) has composed a valse de concert, which she is
scoring: for full orchestra at Signor Hazon’s request. It
will be performed during the orchestral concert season.
Keeping her promise that she would bring her infantile
“Myee ” to thank the school-children in her own childish
way “for the address which they presented to her,” Lady
Carington and her four little daughters paid a visit to the
Fort-street Public School on 9th inst. under the chaperon-
age of Minister for Education Carruthers.
The Sydney civic farewell presentation to Lord Caring-
ton will take the form of a particularly shrieking address
and a casket in gold and polished woods and lined with
white satin.
The tickets for the complimentary ball to Lady Caring-
ton are going off like hot cakes.
Lady Carington holds her positively last reception at
Government House on Saturday, 25th inst., at 3.30 p.m.,
when a bigger crowd than that on Jubilee reception-day
may be confidently expected.
A powder ball is described as—“ that one-sided whim
which lends youth to an old face, but takes all the fresh-
ness out of a young one.”
Melbourne Naval and Military ball will take place in the
Town Hall the evening before Derby day.
The latest Sydney way of spelling Smith is “Sm6th”
with an a accent over the “ e.” There is said to be no
cure for it.
Sydney University Musical Society give a miscellaneous
concert in great hall on 22nd inst. The next production
of the dramatic society will be Green’s “Magic” drama
of “ Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay,” when the part of
“ Margaret” will be undertaken by an especially gifted
lady grad.

“A Pair of Spectacles” is the tale now
told at Sydney Criterion of a benevolent dotard
named Benjamin Goldfinch (R. Brough), who is
an easy prey to the designing. His eyes are at
length very widely opened by the arrival of his
brother Gregory (G. Anson), a Sheffield grinder,
who has no faith in anything but “f brass ” and
a change of spectacles, and he then begins to
live on strictly business principles. The process
is gradually developed : he commences by suspect-
ing the butler (J. Welsh) of brandy-drinking ; his
son (Owen Harris) of wilful extravagance; his
nephew (Cecil Ward) of trading on his benevo-
lence ; his friend, Lorimer (E. C. Corlesse)
of inventing a ship in order to borrow money
from him, and his young wife (Mrs. Brough)
of keeping assignations with a good-looking curate
in the vestry and then declares his total disbelief
in the entire human family, including his brother,
who, when excited by wine, attempted to kiss
“the missus.” Then a bank failure is supposed
to have swallowed his savings, and the son offers
to forego his allowance —though the disinterested-
ness of this is not apparent if it be remembered
that he had taken a communication to the
family-lawyer concerning the shaky financial insti-
tution —and the butler offers his savings, likewise
gratuitous services ; the nephew, his only
asset, a diamond-pin; the friend, whose ship
has come home, offers to lend him £15,000; the
close-fisted brother planks down an unconditional
deed of partnership, and the wife’s innocence is
established. By a return to his old “specs.”
the old softy’s faith in human nature is completely
restored; his son is betrothed to Lorimer’s
daughter (Lilian Seccombe), and the curtain falls
on a scene of trustfulness and universal bliss. The
brothers Goldfinch are the only characters of im-
portance; the others merely flit like shadows
across the stage. Robert Brough neither looks
nor speaks like a charitable crank, but
as the sharp, steak-weighing, grog-measuring
pessimist he is as to the manner born. The
Gradgrinding Gregory of George Anson may be a
trifle over vulgar in makeup, but otherwise it is
without spot or blemish, though full of “wrinkles.”
The other characters, mere feeders, are all ably
impersonated. The curtain-raiser “On an
Island,” by J. W. Jones, is chiefly remarkable for
a beautiful lake scene from the brush of Hedley
Churchward. It is wholly in the hands of
Mrs. Brough and Cecil Ward, who pelt one
another with smart chatter and get through stuff
creditably that in the hands of less caoable people
would fall very flat.
** * *
“Chilperic” has no claim to the title
“comic opera,” for the comic element is ex-
traneous and the operatic is of each variform
character and quality that “musical extrava-
ganza” would surely be a more faithfully descrip-
tive term. Its failure to attract large houses may
be due to the depression which is bound eventually
to affect theatricals like other affairs, but under
any circumstances, splendid scenery, beautiful
dresses, saccharine music and shapely limbs,
unless backed up by something which interests
humanity in the lump cannot continue to draw
audiences. The front-cloth scene of the third
act is an excrescence that should be excised
in the public interest and the business of the
corridor scene which follows might with a little
ingenuity be transferred to the fine tower scene,
which is afterwards disclosed only to be prema-
turely hidden. By the way, stage love-making,
as a rule, is so perfunctory, that one always feels
grateful to the artistes who throw a little realism
into the nyum-nyum business ; on the other hand,
it is possible to be so realistic as to make it evident
that this is no making-believe to love but deadly
earnest. The premiere danseuse, Frances Cobbe,
we believe is the lady’s name, is entitled to
mention for her graceful and spirited pirouetting.
“Chilperic” will run till the 24th, when the
company skips to Melbourne, where, it is said,
Fanny Liddiard is getting ready to impersonate
Paul Jones.
m* * *
“ The Long Strike ” makes it evident that
Bouoicault was not only a student of human
nature in the abstract, but also a close observer
of that section which have reason to be discon-
tented. As Noah Learoyd the thoroughly
characteristic utterances of William Rignold are
delivered with the suppressed intensity which
characterised the speech of the enthusiast of that
period, to whom the righting of labour’s-wrongs
was the sole object of life, and who would deny
himself anything, would do or dare anything
deemed necessary to the interests of his
fellow drudges. Recognising the prominence
of the labour question, Wilson Barrett will
open London New Olympic with a new
drama, “The People’s Idol,” which deals
with Socialism, strikes, and a popular agitator;
George Moore and Arthur Kennedy’s “Strike at
Arlingford,” which will probably be staged soon
in London, of course deals with the same subject.
On the withdrawal of “Long Strike,” “Called
Back ” will probably be revived, when Kate Bishop
will return to the stage as Pauline, George Rignold
will play Macari, and William Rignold, Dr.
Chenery. ,

Maggie Moore, who has been getting

At blazon's Orchestral t onmrts last Satur-

received tremendous encores, though only the
latter was repeated. There were otherwise no

At Sydney Centenary Hall a large audience
received Edison’s Phonograph with great en-
thusiasm on Monday last, and it is evident that
the “funny graft,” as it is called in Surry Hills
circles, will be a sure draw for some weeks.
Everyone is bound to go at least once, though, as
it has no personal attractions to endear it and no
legs worth mentioning, it is not likely that any
bald-head will go oftener. The educational ex-
planations and anecdotes of Professor Archibald
(a gentleman who is continuously bald if not in-
variably arch), are accompanied by screen pictures
and occasional grins: the Professor “ jokes wi
deeficulty.” The other evening the reproduction
of a tin-whistle’s tones was the truest imitation,
therefore it seems evident that sounds which are
shrill, high pitched and independent are most
adapted to that correct registration which precedes
perfect reproduction.
** * *
At Sydney School of Arts a complete
change of programme commencing with the
“Loan of a Lover,” and ending with Fred Davys’
arrangement of “ The Telephone,” continues to
till the house nightly, and it looks as if Harry
Rickards could run an all-the-year-round show
here if he felt disposed. The entrepreneur’s songs
“ Golden Wedding ” and “Perverted Proverbs ”
are encored nightly, and Johnny Gilmore’s stock
of parodies never seems to run dry.

Prior to the flitting of Madame Patey to
Sydney Town Hall (Mayor Burdekin is hereby
informed that the term Centennial is now made
obsolete), Sydney folks had discovered her good
qualities, nevertheless the move is for the better.
It is too much, however, to expect music-lovers to
wade through a bushel of chaff to arrive at the
grains of wheat represented by the great con-
tralto’s items, who can’t help making it evident that
the flautist, John Lemmone (the flute is not a
popular instrument), is the only artiste in the
company who has any claim to a place on the
same platform. Mr. Patey, having recovered
from an attack of “medical certificate,” makes it
evident that he knows how to sing, but can’t;
Bertha Rossow could sing a little if she knew how;
and Austin Craven, utterly lacking in animation
and expression, sings like one who is repeating a
. task. It is said that Madame Patey will assist
the Philharmonic in their Christmas production
of “ The Messiah.”

Bright Maggie Moore, whose matchless art
A storm of admiration raises
In comic or pathetic part—
To thee we sing our praises.
Let liars snarl “Her day is o’er,”
The public answer, “ No, by thunder! ”
And still proclaim, with loud encore,
That Maggie Moore’s a perfect wonder !”
. # * *
The abovementioned merrymaker has in-
fused new life into what threatened to be a languid
' season at Melbourne Princess’. She and Howard
Vernon seized “Mikado” at the tail-end, and
dragged it into popular favour once again. The
“Mascotte” success of Saturday night proved
' conclusively that Maggie Moore’s genius can,
when necessary, brush physical obstacles aside
and do more than atone for any occasional lack of
the vocal powers expected of comic opera stars.
Not that the unprofessional ear detects much cause
for fault-finding in Bettina s tuneful warble. She
might sing the part, or look it, far less efficiently
than at "present, and still get there all the
same. There is but one Maggie Moore,
and her power to please in a wide range of
characters grows no less. Elton gives a clean-
' cut performance of the ducal potentate, and
Knight Ast n reappears as the glue-glue shep-
• herd with tolerably sticky results. Leumane,
who has acquired a depressing habit of dozing off
with his eyes open and leaving the entertainment
to take care of itself, would be the better for an
electric bath, and the rest of this elegantly
mounted show is all very fine and leggy.
*# * *
“ H Trovatore,” at Melbourne Royal, is
a slight improvement upon the horrors of “ Mari-
tana,” inasmuch as the company can chortle their
dialogue instead of vainly attempting to give it
tongue in an intelligible fashion. Regarded from
■ an average standpoint, however, the rendering of
this grand old opera is altogether too puny for the
occasion, like the audience on Saturday night,
which probably numbered about three times as
many sufferers as were engaged in singing or
fiddling them to sleep. It was difficult to get
much sleep during the last act when the contralto
created a discord similar to 17 cats on the tiles.
** * *
“Ours” seems to suit sassiety at the
Bijou, probably because it is embellished with
martial music,' and all the male characters are
engaged in the “ lay-’em-out ” industry. The
• comedy weakens on acquaintance. That thunder-
storm in the first act is but a dry and hollow
, mockery, notwithstanding that flunkeys rush on
with umbrellas to protect everybody from being
drenched by six little bits of paper, or grains of
: sago, which pour down from the pocket of a stage
carpenter, who impersonates the heavens above.
Boucicault, too, is an eminently unsatisfactory
Russian Prince, because one can’t feel quite
certain whether he is more than seven, or less
than eighty-five next birthday. He strikes one
as being old Methusaleh partially born again, and
you never know where to take him seriously.
. “Ours ” will run for another week anyway, after
which B. and B. purpose a first Australian per-
formance of “Harvest.”

The humour of “London, Day by Day,”
assisted by scenery that strikes home to the cock-
ney heart, keeps matters lively at the Alexandra,
but the Opera House show (“ Uncle Tom’s Cabin”)
has been slowly withering, despite a persistent
deluge of notices from the Age, trn organ which is
popularly supposed to be edited by Messrs.
, MacMahon. To-night (Thursday) brings the
moribund nigger to his bier, and then “Jim the
Penman ” appears for one consecutive night, pre-
vious to the setting up of a new mysterious bur-
lesque. On Monday and Wednesday afternoons
David Christie Murray will appear in comedies —
“Gratitude” and “Chums"—written by himsflf,
and of which favourable notices have already been
wafted hither from Maoriland. The Gaiety and
Victoria Halls, Kreitmayer’s Waxworks, and
Cyclorama are filling as is usual at this holiday
time in Melbourne, and on Saturday a great
crowd may be expected to gaze their last upon the
accomplished Santley in the Town Hall.

The Olympic Hippodrome is a solemn
open air entertainment situated between the
annexes of Melbourne Exhibition. Under gloomy
Atmospheric conditions the Hippodrome appears
a nice place to go and die in, but when the full
moon comes round again, and nights are warm, it
may—and doubtless will —become the haunt of
love’s young dream. Here under the star-spangled
azure will Edwin squeeze Angelina’s attention to
the fact that ten horses are laboriously lobbing
round the track with a lovely female at-
tached, or that a number of small boys
are turning somersaults in the dim and silent dis-
tance. Except as a vast resort for ecstatic buggers,
or a colossal indoor and outdoor retreat for such
as want to think about the strike, or escape from
their creditors, it is hard to see much sense in
this Hippodrome, most of which appears to
be a quarter of a mile away when you
look for it. More electric light _is pro-
mised, however, and the pale moon is bound
to fill a long felt want, so unless rain intervenes to
any serious extent the ultimate success of this
idiotic shillingsworth is assured. At some future
time The Bulletin may stop to curse the “ Wild
Frontier Life ” part of Olympia, and give several
distinct reasons why that long-haired object,
Texas Jack, ought to be boiled down into soup for
his poor invalid buck-jumper, which evidently
requires plenty of nourishment to get its courage
up.

“ She Stoops to Conquer,” by the Potter-
Bellew company, made amends for the failure of
“ Mdlle. de Dressier,” at the Adelaide Royal,
Goldsmith’s grand play being witnessed by large
audiences. “ Camille” also was a “go,” and the
full extent of Mrs. B.P.’s wardrobe was exhibited
before an admiring and astonished public, who,
especially ladies, have bestowed a lot of attention
on Curly Blue. The concluding item of the season
is “Romeo and Juliet,” and Mrs. B.P. has re-
ceived a dirty-looking epistle written on a single

Brough and Boucicault have made an
arrangement with the “firm” by which Maud
Williamson will be able to create the leading part
in the forthcoming production of “Harvest.”
This will be about the first opportunity which
this fine actress will have out here of really show-
ing her capabilities. The part, which is a very
strong one, was originally played by Amy Roselle,
who scored heavily in it.
The baritone bruiser has been putting in
his deadly round-armers again. He always
“picks his marks;” nevertheless, he’ll drop across
a snag some day, and then we’ll hear how Bill
Adams lost the battle of Waterloo.

Madame Melba-Armstrong has informed
an American reviewer that she saved £2OOO in
the month of June, and that she won £SOO on hex-
last visit to Monte Carlo. But she’s no gambler.
“What I once put away,” she said, “I never
touch ; besides, I always win when I gamble. It
was just luck. I put five louis on each of the last
six numbers, and one of them turned up every
time.”

In arranging with Madame Burton to
manage her "New Zealand tour, R. S. Smythe
stipulated that no soprano should be engaged who
was over 30, and no tenor or baritone who was
past 40. Good looks, of course, were indispens-
able. It is amusing to think what an asylum for
decaying or decayed artistes Australia is becoming.
About a fortnight ago, in Melbourne, at a Town-
hall concert the vocal quartette party consisted or
a grandmother, an old maid, an old bachelor and
a grandfather, their united ages exceeding 200
years. And people wonder that concerts don’t pay.
Marion Burton s company sailed in the Monowai
for Auckland last week, under the care of their
organiser, the Much-Travelled. All the vocalists
—Marian Burton, Colbourne-Baber, and Henry
Stockwell —are young; the only veteran being
Horace Poussard, “the French Sarasate”--as
R.S.S. calls him—whose talent, like his repertoire,
increases with his .years. Frank Bradley, late
organist of the Alexandra Palace, goes with the
company as conductor.

One of these incidents which make us des-
pair of humanity and discredit the existence of a
Hereafter is reported from Dunedin (N.Z.). At
the theatre there, on a recent evening, when a
thrilling drama was in progress, a solid phalanx of
eighteen young men took up their places in the
circle— and they had all been eating onions. On a
rough estimate there were ten onions inside each
young man, and not middle-sized ones either, but
the largest that could be got for money; and
having got their breath loaded up to the muzzle
they all fired low with devastating effect It was
a ghastly proceed ing.

Wybert Reeve, now acting as resident-
manager, in Adelaide, for W. and (1., has taken a
lease of the Theatre Royal in that city for two
years, dating from April next, when the present
lessees’ term expires. Several improvements are
promised, including a sliding-roof and electric
lightning. He has had to pay an additional
yearly £SOO for a transfer of the lease. It is
rumoured that the profits of Williamson and
Garner during the last two years have been
large, through his management. The movement
—originating with one or two Melbourne
capitalists—for a second Adelaide theatre seems
to have fizzled.

The American cow-boy named Texas Jack,
Jnnr., who was such a howling frost in Sydney
some months ago, has also fallen on evil days at
Melbourne Exhibition Building, where his
attempts to make a very horsey community accept
a four-legged mound of dog’s-meat as an inveterate
buck-jumper, have been received with yells of
derision.
(For “ Poverty Point,” see Page -20.)
Sydney E. Nooze reports that in a local
shooting case “Mary Ann Connors, mother of
the prisoner, deposed that he was very excited
when he drank, and that he had twice committed
suicide.”
When Flinders surveyed the coast of Aus-
tralia (a work which Australia has repaid by
oblivion) he was accompanied by William Westall,
A.R. A., as landscape-painter. Westall’s original
drawings were returned to him after being
engraved by the Admiralty. The Royal Colonial
Institute has now purchased the entire series.
These drawings underwent some curious vicissi-
tudes. When the Porpoise came to grief on
Wreck Reef they were saved with difficulty, and
during the time the party were detained they
were spread out to dry on the sand. Some of the
midshipmen, amongst them one destined after-
wards to be famous as Sir John Franklin, amused
themselves by driving the few sheep that had been
saved across the drawings, and many of them still
bear, in the form of deep indentations, a memento
of this senseless joke.

Jingo J. B. Patterson, when not engaged
in controlling the Victorian Customs department,
appears to be proposing the health of the Militia,
extolling the Mounted Rifles, or indirectly cussing
the “lowerorders.” Patterson was born several
centuries after his time, and that’s a fact. : Nature
intended him for a knight in chain armour, or a
masked headsman, or a heap of burning faggots’,
or any other institution for annulling heretics,
traitors, and radical tendencies. Some years ago
he expressed a parliamentary contempt for litera-
ture, declaring that the world required thinkers,
but he didn’t explain what the world ought to do
with men who think back into the middle ages
and neglect to keep their played-out ideas in the
dark recesses of their puffy, minds. No modern
explanation of Patterson’s war cries is possible,
unless he happens to be in the military accoutre-
ment business, or holds shares in a gunpowder
factory. If financial interests didn’t take him
down to Oastlemaine the other day, in order to
propose the toast of the Victorian Army at a little
football club dinner —well, he must be, suffering
from blood-clots on the brain, or a rush of gore to
the soul, or something similar. Very likely he
eats more meat than is good for him.

“The Conventional Lies
of our Civilisation.”
THE ECONOMIC LIE (CONTINUED). —CHAPTER, III.
BY MAX NORDAU.
Longer, harder toil for the producer, frenzied,
criminal extravagance in the consumer— these are
the direct results of the development of manu-
facturing industries, which tends constantly
towards increased production and lower prices.
Let us assume that all finished products were four
times as dear as they are now, while provisions
remained the same—this is easily conceivable if
the development of the agricultural industries
should overtake or pass beyond that of the manu-
facturing industries. Where would be the harm ?
I see hone, but on the contrary, enormous benefits
to mankind. Each individual would renew his
clothing once instead of four times a year, and
his household goods once in twenty ye ars instead
of once in five. The factory employe would
receive four times the wages at present paid him;
that is, if he is now obliged to toil twelve hours to
earn sufficient to support life, he would obtain the
same result with three hours’ labour. The ex-
penses of the individual consumer would amount
to the same sum total as before, at the close of the
year. But one enormous result would be gained ;
the labouring-man would cease to be a galley-slave
and become a, man. That highest of all luxuries,
of which he is now completely deprived, leisure,
would come within his reach. This means that
be could have his share of the higher pleasures of
civilised life, that he could visit museums and
theatres, read, converse, meditate—that he would
cease to be a machine and could assume the rank
of a man among other men. We must call to the
labouring classes ; You are caught in a horrible
whirlpool. Escape or you are lost I The more
you toil the cheaper be-
come your productions
the consumption of them
grows more lavish, you
must work still longer
and harder to-morrow to
get the means to support
your sheer existence.
Stop work for a while!
Loaf part of your time !
Decrease your work by
a half, by a quarter!
Your earnings will re-
main the same if every
one only consumes what
he actually requires, and
only labours as much as
he is obliged to.
* * *
The professors of poli-
tical economy are not of
this opinion. They have
a horror of leisure for
mankind and believe that
all good and happiness
lie in the most extreme
exertions of man’s labour-
ing faculties. Their
doctrine can be condensed
into two commandments:
Thou shalt consume as
much as possible, no mat-
ter whether the consump-
tion is justified by actual
necessity or not; thou
shalt produce as much
as possible no matter
whether the productions
are needed or not. These
wise men make no dis-
tinction between the fire-
works destined to flare
up for a minute or two,
to astonish some idle
blockheads, and the
machine that turns out
useful bedsteads and
wardrobes yearafter year.
The fireworks cost £2,000;
they represent, in addi-
tion to the materials, the
labour of fifty men
for one year, who were during that time
in perpetual danger. The machine costs £4OO.
But the professor of political economy continues
his dissertation with gentle impartiality : The
fireworks are worth five times as much as
the machine; the workmen are equally usefully
employed in producing them ; the production of
the fire works added to the wealth of the country
as much as if five bed-making machines had been
produced ; and, if it were possible to keep a
million workmen employed in the manufacture of
such fireworks, producing thus a billion dollars’
worth of them annually, and disposing of them,
then the country could be congratulated upon the
blossoming of such an interesting industry and
the workmen upon their diligence and ability.
* # #
According to established theories this train of
thought is without a flaw. According to actual
practice it is a scholastic sophistry of the worst
kind. Certainly it is true that if a man can get
as much money for a rocket as for a fowl, then the
rocket is worth as much as the fowl, and he who
makes a rocket adds as much to the wealth of the
nation as he who raises a fowl. And yet it is a
lie. No, it is not the same to humanity whether
sockets or fowls are produced. No, the Alpine
guide is not as valuable to the human race as the
fireman of the steam threshing-machine, although
it may pay him higher wages than the latter. I
know that my distinctions are leading me to
attack all articles of luxury. Ido not hesitate
then to declare that no humaa being has the right
to demand the gratification of his whims, as long
as the actual necessities of others are unsatisfied',
to Employ workmen in the manufacture of fire-
works, for example, as long as others are famish-
ing, because this workman is withdrawn from the
cultivation of the soil, or to condemn the factory
operatives to fourteen hours a day of slavish toil,
so that the price of velvet may be low enough for
him to clothe himself in the material the most
pleasing to his aesthetic ta&te.
* # #
The great end and aim of humanity in the field
of political economy is not the production of com-
modities for which a price can be obtained, but to
satisfy with its labour the actual organic wants of
the body. There are but two kinds of organic
wants; food and propagation. The former has
for its purpose the preservation of the individual,
the latter the preservation of the race. We might
apparently trace these two wants to one single
source and omit the necessity for the preservation
of the race as not being actually necessary. But
only apparently. The impulse for race-preserva-
tion is as much stronger as the impulse for indi-
vidual self-preservation, as the vital energies and
strength of the race are more powerful than those
of the individual. It has never yet happened that
a considerable body of human beings, an entire
tribe, were prevented for any considerable length
of time from obeying their natural impulse to
perpetuate the race. If such a case should ever
happen, if there should ever arrive a general
national sex-famine, the most horrible scenes of
days of famine that the world has ever seen would
fade into insignificance compared with the pas-
sions and acts of violence that would then be seen.
The two great organic wants of mankind must
satisfied; _ everything beyond these is of
secondary importance. It is possible for an
individual whose appetite is fully satisfied, who
is protected from the cold, with a shelter against
the wind and rain over his head and a companion
of the opposite sex by his side, to be not only con-
tented but absolutely happy and without further
desires. A hungry individual cannot be happy,
nor even contented, even if he were dressed in
gold-brocade land listening to a magnificent
orchestral concert in the Vatican Museum. This
is so self-evident that it is absurd to state it. It
is the prosaic moral of the fable of the cook who
found a pearl and complained because it was not
a grain of corn. And yet this truism is beyond

A SHORN SHEEP.
“An enterprising squatter is offering a bonus for an invention which will allow the sheep to
walk in at one end and come out shorn at the other with the wool already packed and dumped.”
Well, then , here you are.
the mental grasp of the official political economy-
It has never occurred to any of the professors of
this sublime science to test their doctrines by the
homely wisdom of La Fontaine’s book of fables.
Applied to the development of our civilisation in
regard to the matters of political or national
economy, the fable of the cook and the pearl
means simply this: “Less Manchester cotton
goods and Sheffield knives, and more bread and
meat!”
* * *
What theory has neglected up to the present
time, practice will soon set about in earnest: viz.
to demonstrate the preposterousness of the defini-
tions and principles of the present science of
political economy invented and maintained by
and for Capital, and accepted without enquiry by
the world. Already, the world over, man is
labouring beyond all reason and producing beyond
all demand. Almost every civilised country is
trying to export manufactured articles and import
provisions. The markets for the former are be-
ginning to fail. We can say without fear of
exaggeration, that the great manufacturing in-
dustries of the principal countries in Europe have
found all the markets they ever will find. These
conditions can only grow worse, never better. The
countries which are not yet developed as regards
manufactures are grad ually becoming so. Processes
of labour will be still more improved, machines
still further increased 'and perfected, and then ?
Then each country will be able to supply its own
demand for manufactured articles and have an
abundance left over that it will try to dispose of
to its neighbour, but in vain, for the latter will
have no use for them. The very latest naked
negro on the upper Congo will have his 50 yards
of cotton cloth and his gun, the very last Papuan
his boots and his paper collars. The European
will have then reached the point of buying anew
suit of clothes every week, and having a machine
to turn over the leaves of his magazine. This
will be the Golden Age of the political economists
who are so captivated by unrestricted production,
unbounded consumption and an unlimited
development of manufactures. And in this
Golden Age, when the entire country will
be set as thick with factory chimneys as
it is now with trees, the people will live on
chemical substitutes for food instead of bread and
meat, they will toil eighteen hours out of the
twenty-four and die without knowing that they
have ever lived. Perhaps it will not be necessary
to wait until this Golden Age arrives for the fact
to dawn upon certain enlightened minds or circles,
that this excessive, one-sided industrialism is a
wholesale suicide of the human race, and that
everything which the science of political economy
alleges in its favour is a lie and a fraud. We
have already become convinced of the fact that a
country which exports breadstuffs, if it exhausts
the soil and does not return to it in some way or
other, the matter of which it is deprived by the
growing grain, is gradually growing poorer, al-
though untold millions may be pouring into it
from other countries. We will become convinced
of another fact sooner or later, that the exporta-
tion of labour, of muscle and nerve, in the shape
of manufactured articles, will make a people grow
poorer and poorer, no matter how much gold it
receives in exchange for them. The European
factory-operative is even now the slave of the
negro on the Congo. He stills his hunger with
potatoes and vile whisky, he spends his life in
the machine-room and dies of turberculosis so
that some barbarian may lead a more comfortable
existence than has hitherto been the case. This
feverish labour, which is not applied to the pro-
duction of food but to industrial over-production,
will finally produce a nation of hungry money-
bags. The world may then behold the spectacle
of a country where a piano of the very latest
make stands in every cottage, the people rustling
in brand-new clothing, but with rachitis in their
bones, no blood in their veins and consumption in
their lungs.

It is cabled that the British National Art
Scholarship has been gained by a brilliant armless
student who holds the brush in his mouth.
A nicely-bound little volume is the “ Lyrics
and Rhymes” of “ Ab. Original ” (Jas, Sadler,
a South Australian versifier), forwarded to us bv
the publishers, Sands and M‘Dougall. In the
author’s preface he asserts that most of the verse
has already been circulated in the columns of
various newspapers and magazines, and no doubt
many of the pieces are suitable for publication in
the ordinary journal, but some of them, parti-
cularly the attemptedly humorous, do not deserve
publication in any carefully-edited periodical,
much less in book form. Perhaps the best item
m the book is that entitled “ Australia,” but even
that does not scan correctly throughout. No
doubt the author’s reason for bringing such a
weak selection into prominence is the desire—a
natural one—to house, for his own reference and
delectation, his poetic progeny within the shelter
of two boards and a gold-lettered back.
London Hawk has an Australian story,
not badly told, of the young squatter who tried to
wean his new-chum wife of an intense dread of
snakes by placing a newly-killed female tiger
snake in her bedroom after dark. Here, he soon
after found his wife’s corpse. She had been killed
by the male tiger-snake, which had followed the
trail of his mate’s body. But the writer is evi-
dently not an Australian, for he talks of the
station “block-house,” he asserts that “the
laughing jackass is as strong on the wing as a
wild-goose or falcon, it will travel at an amazing
height, it will detect its prey at an incredible
distance below, and coming down like a meteorite,
its sudden strident demoniac cry paralyses the
object of its attack before its heavy hammer-like
bill bangs into its victim’s brain also, that
“the backs of tiger-snakes are jet black and
their bellies bright scarlet.” Australians need
not be told that the Johnny-bird is an offensive
little creature whose main points are his laugh
and his bill, that he is not strong on the wing,
never “soars in the golden-empyrean,” and usually
perches on some limb that is near the ground
whence he drops silently on his prev with the
noiselessness of a cat and the solidity of a stone.
As for the tiger-snake, no Australian snake, even
m breeding-time, everwas arrayed in such gorgeous
hues as those the writer speaks of.

A Parisian not known to be a lunatic
asked two friends to supper. Then he tendered
them the bill. They demurred, saying: “You
asked us to sup with you.” Replied the lunatic:
“ I asked you to sup and you supped. Now I ask
you to pay—so pay.”
The millionaire, Sir Thomas Elder, who
is a Gr.C.M.G., like Premier Parkes, but who
possibly would like to be a Baronet, has offered to

Australasia provided the route and general nature
of the scheme are first submitted to him for
approval.
Excessive heart-palpitation can always be
arrested by bending double, with the head down-
ward and the hands pendent, so as to produce a
temporary congestion of the upper part of the
body. In almost all cases of nervous or anaemic
palpitation the heart immediately resumes its
natural function. If the respiratory movements
be suspended during this action, the effect is only
the more rapid.

An Unscrupulous Foe
Creeps upon us unawares like an assassin in the
dark and whose dangerous proximity we never
suspect until it makes the last fatal clutch on
some vital organ. We are always warned in
ample time of the impending danger, but with
criminal carelessness neglect these warnings:
That tired feeling, those aching limbs, and that
grand feeling one day and seedy condition the
next, and sour taste on waking in a morning, and
the frequent sick and splitting headaches, all
make their debut before serious illness sets in.
All or any of these symptoms indicate the
approach of disease, they are faithful signs that
the liver and kidneys are not doing their duties
that the morbid and effete matter instead of being
eliminated from the system, is being retained
and is positively poisoning and destroying the
whole physical structure. Neglect in such cases
is criminal, recourse to rational treatment should
be had at once. Clements Tonic should be taken
to strengthen the digestion, purify and fortify the
blood, to stimulate the liver and brace up the
kidneys, to resolve and eliminate the poisonous
urea. Liver and kidney complaints are the most
prevalent diseases of this country, and so long a*
we consume such large quantities of animal food
and condiments, and drink so freely of tea and
stimulants, so long will this unhealthy condition
last. It is this mode of life that causes such
numbers of deaths from heart disease, Bright’s
disease, dropsy, cancer, inflammation and enlarge-
ment of the liver, and similar causes, all of which
herald their approach by feelings of lassitude,
headache, languor &c., and if prompt treatment
at once is adopted by a regular use of Clements
lonic, the. progress of disease is arrested, the
stomach, liver and kidneys resume their normal
action and the poisonous accumulations are ex-
polled the system and normal health is restored.
I hat Clements Tonic is reliable is pi'ovcd beyond
aU question and we have grateful beneficiaries in
every town and village who are continually

St. Leonards, Sydney,—Dear sir.—l can with
pleasure bear witness to the great relief I have
received from the use of Clements Tonic and Dr.
I letcher’s Pills. I have been a great sufferer for
II years from liver disease, with at times con-
siderable enlargement, which caused a swelling in
the side under the ribs and was very painful, the
abdomen, bowels, &c., always felt very tender on
pressure, with most obstinate constipation for
which I took Fletcher’s Pills, the first dose caused
a copious evacuation and gave great relief, and I
thought I was all right, but after a week I was as
bad again as before. I again had recourse to
I 1 letcher s 1 ills, but I took Clements Tonic as
well this time and continued it for a couple of
months, after the first dose 1 felt better and got
rid of all the symptoms I used to have, as flush-
ings of heat and cold, splitting headaches, pains
in the side and small of the back, extreme lassitude,
and the general feeling of ‘ all-right to-day, seedy
to-morrow,’ all these symptoms with many others
I used to have, but now thanks to Clements Tonic
lam quite cured. I can get up in a morning
refreshed by the night’s rest and can eat a good
breakfast, whereas before taking the medicine I
scarcely ever could eat anything, and when I did
it nearly always made me vomit, but now I am
quite well and have been so for five months, I
have no cause to fear a relapse. I don’t mind
your publishing my case if you add nothing to it,
as it may bring relief to similar sufferers.—Yours
very truly, H. Garkell.”

In Victoria eighteen public schools are

not publicly and outside Parliament accuse any
man known to be possessed of £5OOO of having

“This country is Christian!” screamed

Loudon Times having accused St. Jambs’

in the forgery and stuck to it longer than any
other Unionist journal.
When the Australian Democratic party

in the agreement that said members shall not

If the Unionists win, lie is the individual who
jumped on M'Millan with all his ponderous
weight in their interests. If the employers win,
he is the individual who thought better of it, and
apologised to the friend of capital. In either case

can either accentuate matters by jumping on
M‘Millan again, or by apologising to him again,
according to circumstances.
The Congress is waking up. During a
recent debate one member told another that lie
“abounded in wind,” and the other yelled :
“You’re only fit to argue with a stable-boy!
Then the House was filled with remarks of
‘ ‘ You’re a blamed liar!” “ You’re a liar yourself,

Dr. Mackellar, of the N.S.W. Upper
House, reports that “a spice of the autocratic
spirit of Germany might not be a disadvantage,
for the suppression of strikers and the squashing of
everybody who doesn’t think as he thinks. Appar-
ently the Doctor takes it for granted that he must
necessarily be the individual who runs the “spirit"
in question. But then supposing the majority
instead of the minority began to boss the machine,
and confiscated Doctor Mackellar’s property, and
fired him out of the country—how would the

An English paper reports that a labourer
in Leicestershire was recently deprived of his vote
because his mother had been buried at the expense
of the parish, in consequence of which he was
ranked as a pauper. In the same week the mother
of the old “Shook of Gambridge” was buried at
the expense of the country, and the bill—£lBo—
charged to the nation at large, so that even
the humble labourer in Leicestershire had to pay
his share of the old Duchess’s funeral. But the
venerable “Shook” doesn’t rank as a pauper for
all that, and he goes on voting just the same.
The American Protective system is to be
studied in its bearing on the most important
national questions, as in Australia. Great Ameri-
can statesmen, in the youth of the nation, wanted
Protection not for economic, but for political,
reasons. The Democrats (Freetraders) claimed
State independence, while the Republicans went
in for Protection, to create a body of manufac-
turers dependent on the Central Government, and
thus a backbone of Federalism. These political
bearings must always be remembered in regard to
Protection, as we see over the M‘Kinley Tariff.
Mr. Lawrence Finn, of Broken Hill (who
insinuates in his advt. that he has locally made a
fortune as a whisky-seller), has declared his in-
tention of contesting that constituency “ against
all comers.” Mr. Finn evidently believes in the
good old bluff style of doing business. The
Bulletin doesn’t know Mr. Finn, but it hopes
the Broken Hill miners will put up and vote solidly
for someone with better qualifications and more
political sincerity than are possessed by the
typical vendor of alcohol. The workman can’t
afford to put up publicans and estrange the local-
option vote, any more than he can afford to plump
for teetotal cranks, and thus invite the hostility
of the man who drinks beer at dinner.
Gov. Carington said at Melbourne last
week that if loyalty meant certain specified things,
“ then, surely as to-morrow the sun will rise on
the earth, so will the great British Confederation,
which is already three times as large as Europe,
and which three times over exceeds the United
States of Northern America in bulk, revenue, and
population, remain one—united, loyal, and invin-
cible—for all time.” Now, Baron, how big
would the British Empire be were_ India, with its
1 649 000 square miles to secede? That India,
whose 272,000,000 of dusky sons are not satisfied
subjects, equal in condition and equality before
the laws with the inhabitants of Britain, is the
motherland of conquered slaves, inhabitants of a
dependency only prevented from achieving inde-
pendence through the artful sowing of dissension
by the victors among her ignorant and antagonis-
tic castes.

A now well-known Australian barristei
left Europe because his best girl married a rival
suitor. A few months ago, learning that she had
become a widow, he journeyed back, made her his
wife and brought her out to Australia. And yet
she has neither money nor beauty.

The following dreadful outrage on an ex-
hausted participle was the work of a live Governor
at the Southern Carington farewell banquet:—
Gentlemen,—You have drunk with well-merited admir-
ation to the health of a neighbouring Governor, who,
alas ! is shortly to leave these shores, and you have now
drunk to the health of another neighbour who remains. ■
I believe that you share my feeling, that having drunk
the loyal toast of the Queen, and having drunk one to
him who represents her, and who represents her well—
foheers)—there is no necessity for any other speeches
besides that of the guest of the evening.
What a drunk ! Why doesn’t the Gov. take a
lesson in oratory from that eloquent lawyer who
stated that “among all the cases which he had
ever met, if there ever was a case which required
to be considered in connection with another case
that case was this case?” And the Judge asked
him sadly : “ Which case ?”
# # #
A small unpleasantness prevails in legal
circles in Brisbane. Some offensive individual
states that the Chief Justice’s son was retained in
72 per cent of the cases tried before that gentle-
man last year. Consequently he wants to know
if the son practises so extensively before his
father because he gets on better there than before
a Judge who is not his father, and if so, how does
the litigant on the other side feel about it, and
what sort of success does he meet with on an
average? Apparently a Judge should be doomed
to celibacy, or else a barrister ought to be ah
orphan, and then these problems would not arise.

between a richly-gilt Sydney girl and Lord Rose-
hill, A.D.C. to Victoria’s Hopetoun.

Lady Hopetoun travelled overland to
Adelaide, en route for dear old Hingland, so as to
escape the humiliation of the “ Oh, my !” between
ports. She couldn’t have left Melbourne with less
pomp and circumstance had she been a clerk
bolting with the petty cash.

Governor Kintore has a mania for driving
engines. Whenever he goes on a trip he acts as
engineer and runs the show. He has frequently
steered the trains when on a trip in S. Australia,
and his latest feat was to act as engineer of the
Adelaide-Melbourne express on returning from
the Carington banquet. Kintore claims practical
knowledge, having been apprenticed to it in his
youth. But suppose, some of these days, there is a
train badly upset, and a howling crowd of widows
and orphans assemble outside Adelaide Govern-
ment House and yell for blood. What thumping
verdicts a jury of twelve will give !
•* * *
The chief Lothario in a certain guberna-
torial suite bolts to another capital—they say—
after whizzing around like chain-shot.
* # *
As showing the small reverence the pluto-
cracy of Adelaide has for Lady Kintore, it need
only be mentioned that very little is being done
to give her a fitting farewell, although it is not at
all unlikely she will not return. As for Kintore
himself, he still maintains an exclusiveness almost
exceeding that of his wife.

which has long been current about a N.S.W.

Dear Bulletin, — Apropos to a recent
Bulletin paragraph on the subject, I may tell
you that the few men still standing out of the
Victorian Reporters’ Association are determined
not to give in, and consequently a small struggle
is expected. The non-associated reporters’ chief
reason for not joining the majority is that the
Union is useless for any Union purposes. The
members of the Association refuse to affiliate
with the compositors on the ground that they (the
former) are a superior race of bipeds, but without
the compositors no newspaper-proprietor can ever
be brought to terms.—Reporter,

It is estimated that the Prince of Wales is
prayed for in 50,000 Anglican churches every
Sunday. Not long ago, at Balmain, Sydney, one
Sunday night, when the parson had just come to
the part of the service where the prayers of the
congregation were invoked for “Wales,” a shrill
voice in the back pews yelled out, “ Hi! Don’t
pray for that blanky blank, he’s no —— good.”
Without much ceremony the desecrator—who was
no other than “Lady” Munro —was promptly
bundled out, but not before the congregation
broke into a snigger, which a subsequent sermon
on hell-fire couldn’t frighten off their faces.

A Melbourne man writes to the press
ascribing the death of three of his children to

dangerous. But, then, so is eating your breakfast.

The London correspondent of Melbourne
Age, writing of Sir Salmon Wilson and society in
London, says that “ Sir Daniel Cooper has
scarcely managed to hold his own. He has never
emerged from the ruck of city knights and suc-
cessful soap-boilers, even although he owns half
Sydney, and people know that This is
mere spite. Had Sir Daniel been a Victorian we
should have had a “ slobber.” The Age does not
tell us the truth about Sir Samuel Wilson —which
is, that it is Lady Wilson—a handsome and clever
woman —who has got her fat, red-whiskered money-
bags into society. Sir Daniel Cooper is a compara-
tively modest man, who has more personal friends
among the people who would be worth knowing if
they had no money, and among those who would
continue to know a man after he had lost his
money, than the Knight of Ercildoune.

A heart-broken widow publishes the tale
of her desolation in a Victorian country paper

IN loving remembrance of my dear husband, John
, who departed this life on Ist October, 1888,
aged 52 years. Also the eight beloved children of the
above, and my loving mother. Inserted by his fond
wife, sons, and daughters. An honest and upright
man, but a fool to himself, wife, and family.
Evidently the poor, smitten widow did her best
to impress upon the deceased that he was a great
ass while he was alive, and now that he is gone
she heaves the cheerful information after him lest
he should forget his mental incapacity in the Vale
of Paradise.

Rev. Bevan, of Melbourne, in the course
of a farewell address to “Colonel ” Barker, stated
that the Salvation Army in Victoria was getting
“too respectable and orderly, and that they
should be more enthusiastic and consequently
more demonstrative.” We contemplate having
Rev. Bevan summoned for language calculated to
cause a breach of the peace. This sort of thing
must end in bloodshed.

Sydney is the paradise of quacks. The

An old Sydney man, who prosecuted his

writes it down on paper.” P.S.—(“ Great

Fergus Hume’s new novel is entitled “ The

should bo kept separate from the other prisoners.
The orphan didn’t get anything—not a cent. The
Lord loveth a cheerful giver. Which means that
the judge should have cheerfully given him five
years.

Sufficient for all to be fed, .

The stuff that but Jciyns to be wheaten —
Aye, e'en in the matter of hour ;
From the meals, heavy meals that are meaten,
And send the hot blood to one’s head,
We shrink, like a rooster when beaten.

Give us bread, be it heavy or lighter,
O, baker, who calls at our door,
That the lives may be longer and brighter,
Alike of the rich and the poor;
For your loaves (small brown loaves, or the whiter)
Lay a man in his last little bed,
After rotting the teeth of the biter.

A number of nice, superior Melbourne
people have unfolded the prospectus of a
a new Reform Club, the objects of which
are “the delineation and representation of the
various practices of art in its highest form,
mutual improvement, individual freedom, . and
existence according to the laws of life.” A Miss
Lepper appears to be high priestess, pro tern., of
this promising concern, and at a preliminary
meeting she laid down the following fundamental
principles:—“No member shall take tobacco,
alcohol or tea, or wear full evening dress. Arti-
ficial beautifying or other external eccentricity or
vulgarity, now so fashionable, is to be strictly
prohibited.” Each member must take a daily
bath, and no carnal cravings for refreshments at
the club meetings shall be satisfied. The Reform
Club, in fact, is intended as a refuge for all who
don’t wish to eat, drink and be merry, but are
contented to sit around and improve and acquire
calm delights. As Miss Lepper is now receiving
applications, we respectfully beg to put in our
credentials herewith. ’ i
A member of your Club,
Miss L., we wish to be;
We loathe the name of pub.,
And scorn the thought of tea ;
We feed on plainest fare —
As plain as maidens old :
We never dye our hair.
Our drink is water cold.
We do so dote on art;
Our manner’s very staid :
We would not eat a tart,
No, not if we were paid ;
And, as for evening dress —
A pretty woman’s bust
Is wicked—nothing less—
And fills us with disgust.
The smell of a cigar
Arouses all our wrath ;
We play on the guitar
And take a daily bath ;
1 Our custom it has been,
Since we began to talk,
Our pearly teeth to clean
With camphorated chalk.
Improvement is our aim
; And freedom our delight,
We think it is a shame
To stop up late at night;
| At meetings of the Club
We don’t expect to find
1 . Strong drinkables or grub.
But ’freshment for the mind.
A girl we’ve never kissed
. Or had a mind to squeeze—
O ! put us on your list,
, Miss Lepper, if you please ;
The staunch support of men
Like us you will require—
■ Accept a blessing, then,
From Faddie Prig, Esquire.

One of the most edifying and suggestive
incidents of the N.S.W. military dinner to Gov.
Carington was the manner in which General
Richardson slavered to Premier Parkes after the
unceremonious snubbing received by him from the
latter a day or two previously. “ A painful
accident had deprived them of the genial
Cmce of the veteran statesmen who was the
of the Government and of the Military
Department,” said the General. (Applause.)
“Genial!” Ha, ha!

The Melbourne Mayoralty had to go a-
begging this year, and Lang is persuaded to have
another turn, like Benjamin and Meares. It is
unlikely that any future Melbourne Mayor will
ever come up to the old sextennial standard of
Jaoky Tommy Smith.

The “freckle party” is the latest social
device in America, and it is said to be spreading
rapidly through the land where the wooden nut-
meg grows, and the timber ham blossoms in the
spring. Each fellow at the party puts up a sub-
scription on behalf of his own girl, and the one
with the most freckles takes the lot. A committee
of gentlemen inspects the freckles and reports
thereon.

One of Fire-Low-and-Lay-’em-Out-Price’s
petty tyrannies is unearthed. Two mounted
riflemen came on parade with crape on their arms,
and Brice made them tear it off, while he had
crape on his own arm, but apparently his sorrows
were not to be vulgarised. He explains that the
regulations warrant this distinction, but even he,
not being a General (yet), wouldn’t dare to wear
crape at a levee. What hideous bosh !

Strenuous opponents of Pitman are the
Victorian Parliamentary shorthand reporters
[not the Hansard men, mind you,) swearing by
Gurney, whose system they have reduced to the
perfection of Euclid, so that every man can read
and transcribe every other, even on the most
abstruse subjects. The late Webb, brother of
Judge Webb, laid the foundations, the Judge
being also in it, and the work has been carried for-
ward chiefly by G. Bell, now chief insolvency
clerk, and Wade, the present chief reporter.

The Smile of Smiles That Never But One
Face Wore.
Play me a march low-tuned and slow —a march
for a silent tread,
Fit for the wandering feet of one who dreams of
the silent dead,
Lonely, between the bones below and the souls
that are overhead.
Why do we mourn the days that go?—for the
same sun shines each day,
Ever a spring her primrose hath, and ever a May
her may—
Sweet as the rose that died last year is the rose
that is born to-day.
Do we not too return, we men, as over the round
earth whirls ?
Never a head is dimmed with grey but another is
sunned with curls,
She was a girl and he was a boy, but yet there are
boys and girls.
Ah, but alas for the smile of smiles that never but
one face wore,
Ah for the voice that has flown away like a bird
to an unseen shore.
Ah for the face—the flower of flowers—that
blossoms on earth no more !

When the fifties were very young, John
Bayly Darvall, Q.C., pf theN.S.W. Bar, accepted
a judgeship in Victoria. On arrival in Melbourne
he went the round of all the hotels and boarding-
houses in search of a bed and failed to get one.
He humped his carpet-bag to the old Melbourne
Club house in Collins-street, where they accom-
modated him with a shake-down for the night.
He declined the judgeship, and returned to Syd-
ney by first steamer.
A Maryborough (Vic.) youth of 11 years

A cablegram about the discovery of
antique, mysterious, and inexplicable ruins, in
Mashoualand, East Africa, rouses the savants.
The discoveries add to the painful gaps of ignor-
ance in the learning of the wisest, and are as
puzzling as the ruins of high civilisation found in
Cambodia, Cochin China, in North America, and
even in places like Easter Island. They say the
continent of Atlantis is all plunged in the
Atlantic Ocean, but there are bewildering frag-
ments in various parts of the globe.

Young Lord Dudley seems to be growing
more of a lunatic every day. One of his latest
flashes of frenzy occurred at a yearling sale, where
he followed somebody’s bid of 1800 guineas with
one for 3000—and for a filly, too. There wasn’t
the slightest sense in jumping 1200 guineas at one
spring, so even the courtly Tattersall ventured to
suggest that “ his lordship must have meant two
thousand.” To which Dudley, with masterly
“ coolness,” replied that he meant the extra thou.,
wherefore the filly was knocked down to him, and
the newspapers said his lordship displayed great
courage and genius in bidding such a lot all at
once.
Divers exchanges now tell the tale of that
fine old friend of the Prince of Wales, Johnny
Toole, who, while sitting at a table next to a
gentleman who had helped himself to a very large
piece of bread, took i.t up and began to cut a slice
from it. “ Sir,” said the gentleman, “ that is my
bread.” “I beg a thousand pardons, sir,” replied
Toole, “I declare I mistook it for the loaf.”
Right there the story breaks off short. The
Bulletin now gives the sequel. In a few moments
the gentleman took up his knife and began sweep-
ing it across the comedian’s mouth. “ Sir,” said
Mr. Toole, “what do you mean?” “I beg a
thousand pardons, sir,” replied the gentleman,
“I declare I mistook your oleaginous smile for
the butter.”
Fronde on Newman in his Oxford days :
His appearance was striking. He was above the middle
height, slight, and spare. His head was large, his face
remarkably like that of Julius Osesar. The forehead, the
shape of the ears and nose, were almost the same. The
lines of the mouth were very peculiar, and I should say
exactly the same. I have often thought of the resem-
blance, and believe that it extended to the temperament.
In both there was an original force of character which
refused to be moulded by circumstances, which was to
make its own way and become a power in the world ; a
clearness of intellectual perception, a disdain for conven-
tionalities, a temper imperious and wilful, but along with
it a most attaching gentleness, sweetness, singleness of
heart and purpose. Both were formed by nature to com-
mand others, both had the faculty of attaching to them-
selves the passionate devotion of their friends and fol-
lowers, and in both cases, too, perhaps, the devotion was
rather due to the personal ascendency of the leader rather
than to the cause which he represented.
In the most recent edition of “Burke’s
Peerage, Baronetage, and Knightage,” Sir Graham
Berry, K.0.M.G., &c., omits all reference to his
first wife, the good little woman who helped him
to push the huckster’s shop on the Punt-road
South Yarra, in Governor Barkly’s early days.
We remember her, though, and a sturdy little
body she was. While Graham was out o’ nights
spouting, before ever he got seat or title, she
wrapped up pounds of salt-butter, bars of soap,
and quarters of tea with all the aptitude of a
grocer’s apprentice. Graham—who always be-
lieved he would reach the goal-used to console
her with “ It will be all right, my dear, when we
go to Government House !” The little woman
didn’t live to see Graham’s greatness, tho’ she saw
him go to Government House several times, but
then ’twas with the week’s groceries for the ser-
vants on board-wages.
The bald, hungry and naked republic of
Venezuela has just finished a disastrous campaign
against the British colony of Guiana. An army
of fourteen unshod warriors was sent forth to settle
the disputed frontier question by force of arms ;
but unhappily the canoe with the commissariat
capsized, and the colonel in command was bitten
by an ass, and the captain got inflamed through
sitting down too much, and the hostile expedition
lost itself in a desolate region and lived on bark.
Finally they struck a British settlement, and
surrendered to the local J.P., who seized their
weapons on the ground that they were found
carrying guns without a license, and then told
them to go down into the kitchen and get some
cold beef. The army was allowed to rest for a
couple of days in the cowshed, and is now return-
ing home on foot and unarmed, and living chiefly
on cold monkey. Further complications are
expected.
John Dennistoun Wood rushes to the
fray, furiously attacking Chief-Justice Higin-
botham, with over a column in the Melbourne
Tory poper. Who’s Wood? Well, it’s not the
sculptor, but a fine, olarety old barrister, a virtuoso
reminding one of those weather-beaten statutes in
the Public Gardens, perhaps without an ear, nose,
arm, and their fingers and toes nibbled off by
attrition. He rakes up his old fires of political
hatred to Higinbotham. Wood scuttled to Lon-
don when M'Culloch, Michie, Verdon and Co.
began to “ ruin the country.”
The following advertisement is from a
Victorian paper. It requires a lot of considera-
tion ;
A TTRACTIVE young Lady can offer a Home to five
or six Gentlemen of refined habits. 27/6 per
week. Apply, &o.
Five or six breach of promise cases, we presume,
and five or six gentlemen left without a cent, and
all anathematising the day when they paid 27/6
for the blessings of a home. It is better to reside
with a widow who has freckles, and a jaw that was
evidently borrowed from a gorilla, and hair like
the tail of a horse, for though she may not make
life particularly happy, it is consoling to remember
that she will never recover damages unless the
case is tried by a blind jury down a coal-pit.
Deceptive Spring.
“ The season when to come and when to go,
To sing or cease to sing we never know.”
Pope.
Gentle spring is once more with us. It recurs
every year, and the unvarying phenomena is
explained by what we know of the sun’s or earth’s
motion. This is the season which arouses the
enthusiasm of mankind by the charms of the
surrounding beauty and variety of effect. We
behold budding and flowering trees, flowers, plants,
saplings, and other branches grow with force and
luxuriance diffusing beauty, which delights the
senses and charms the mind. Thompson patheti-
aally exclaims:—
“Come, gentle spring, ethereal mildness come
And from the bosom of your dropping cloud
Upon our plains descend.”
Milton equally enraptured, calls it ;
“ The seasons prime for sweetest scents and airs.”
Nature involuntarily rouses the heart to a pitch
of enthusiasm, and it is therefore not surprising
that poets and artists emulated in singing the
boundless praises of beautiful spring. The German
poets of all ages gave vent to their feelings by a
panegyric
An den wundershoenen Frilhling —
Leise zieht durch mein Gemiith
Liebliches Gel ante
Klinge, kleines Fruhlingslied,
Kling hinaus in’s Weite !
The French with similar emphasis exclaims :
Tout renait d la vie
Aux rayons du f/rinleriips,
Et dans ndtre dme ravie
Exhale un parfum d’amour.
Thus the fair spring has ever been extolled,
while, alas, it has lured countless thousands of
victims to their unprepared graves. Spring in its
gaudy disguise is the most treacherous and decep-
tive of the seasons. Under every blade of bound-
ing grass is the germ of death. Beneath the
budding tree, alas, lurks the demon of sickness.
Malarial poisons are drawn in with every breath,
and the germs of disease that are absorbed in in-
numerable ways, all prove the dangerous nature
of the season that separates winter and summer.
It requires the most powerful constitution to
successfully repel the poisonous atmosphere.
Thus thousands are every year nipped in the
bloom of beauty, wit and youth, and carried
to that bourne whence no mortal returns. This
is the season when a restorative is absolutely
necessary to fortify the system and throw off the
enemies of health. No doubt you divine the
restorative which is needed. That remedy is
Warner’s safe cure, which, by its action oii the
vital organs, banishes dull care and pain, removes
■he languid sensations, creates an appetite, puri-
fies and enriches the blood, and restores health
and happiness when the body is bowed with pain,
and when life seems a burden too great to bear.
It is used by rich and poor alike with infallible
success. Says Mr. W. Howard Leonard, M.L. A.,
of Collins Street, Melbourne, the popular member
for Carlton, under very recent date:—“l have
repeatedly taken Warner’s safe cure when afflicted,
with such remarkable success, that the result fully
justifies me in attesting to its high curative
properties.” Voluntary, attestations from in-
fluential sources like the above could be quoted
ad infinitum, and should be the means in pointing
out with empha-is the guide to health. It is time
that the deceptive praises of artist and poet are
exposed in all their sophistic fallacy, for prompt
action alone will avert impending disaster, and
avoid the subtle perils of “ deceptive spring.”

WHEN THE BLOOD is thin or imptir*
every organ and fibre of the body becomes en-
feebled and less capable of resisting prevailing
diseases. Among the indications, of depraved
blood are boils, carbuncles, pimples, eruptions,
sore eyes, ulcers, tumors, and glandular swell-
ings. To strike at the root of these evils,
cleanse the blood with Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.
This medicine has maintained its world-wide
reputation, for nearly half a century, as the
Standard Blood-Purifier.
It is a highly-concentrated extract.of the most
powerful vegetable alteratives and tonics. The
most effective remedy for scrofula, it ijs equally
beneficial in gout, rheumatism, catarrh, and
dyspepsia, also In liver and kidney com-
plaints. A medicine for men, women,
and children. Be sure and ask for

Editor Bulletin.— Sir,—In your issue of 2ml
last, there is published a very caustic article reflecting m
no measured terms on me and the Society to which X
have the honour of being secretary. May I ask for space
for the following, in reply to that article? .
1. This Society, as its name implies, is a society for
organising charity , and not for distributing relief. (It
is curious, but true, that this society strives to perforin
the work for which it was called into existence, and not j
that—however noble and desirable —for which its founders
did not intend it.) . ■ ... .
Therefore, we strive to strengthen existing chanties by
inducing co-operation, in the light of full knowledge
of each other’s work and by organisation, so as to
prevent wasted effort and to check imposition.
Therefore, we strive to draw a strong distinction between
the functions of public and private charities, assign-
ing to each its own sphere, stimulating each to
generous,action, and giving each worthy objects tor
the exercise of its energies.
Therefore, we only give out of our own funds when a case
arises which cannot at once be referred to the proper
quarters for relief, and only pending such reference.
The less We find it necessary to give, the more is the
credit due to the people of this city who have so
amply provided for ordinary exigencies.
2. This Society does not receive subscriptions for
charitable relief. There is no mistake about that fact.
Our subscribers are fully aware that the guinea per
annum which they send us is not intended for distribu-
tion among the poor any more than is the weekly six-
pence I pay for Tub Bulletin. We do not, I am proud to
say, consist of people who consider that they discharge
their duty to the poor by a small yearly subscription.
Our members are ready and willing to give money, tune,
and energy to benefit the poor. The Society exists to
guide, advise, and protect them. Surely not an ignoble
3. The religious opinions of applicants are not of
the smallest interest to me. I never ask, and don t
want to know, anything about thtir theological views.
My investigations are directed to two points, and two
only. There are the answers to these questions. Is the
applicant really in need? if so, which is the most
effectual mode of helping the particular case ? And 1 re-
port, or act, according to the result.
4. I did not tell the Royal Commission that destitute
casuals should 1 e sent to gaol. I stated that in my
opinion (and it was understood to be my own personal
view)some of the existing “shelters” were so unsatis-
factory—so little adapted to-the wise and humane dis-
charge of the duties tor which they exist-that Society
would act more kindly to the casual applicant by sending
him to gaol, than to these institutions. I hold, of course,
that it would be disgraceful to send a poor man to
gaol merely because he was poor (one of my earliest
reports was strongly against the “gaol-relief” which
seems prevalent in all the colonies), yet I expressed this
opinion—and I maintain it. , ... , ,
Let me call your attention to the enclosed cutting, from
the local Arqcs of the 27th ult., of an article entitled
“Cequ'on voit, et ce qu’on nevoit pas.” It is a good
statement of our case, and is written by a man who could,
I daresay, surprise you by proving from his cheque-book
how often he has been called upon by the bowelless
committee of one ” to assist in cases where help was
I told the Commission that 500 cases had been helped
in various ways. If the writer of the article which deals
so savagely with me would call at our office, even he might
be satisfied that we do great work in helping the really
poor I think I could give him particulars with respect
to those 5GO* that would alter his opinion of us. Our
great touchstone is the question—is there real necessity
in this case? If the answer is “yes,” then we see that
the case is relieved effectually \ and we also stuve to
learn why the case was necessitous, and with whom lay
the fault. Airain, I say, not a task to be ashamed of.
With respect to the £12 4s. 9d.—it is a mere matter of
book-keeping. Perhaps the enclosed copy of my letter to
the local Age, of 30th ult., explains the case so fully that
I do not need to repeal the statement.—Yours, &c., Jacob
Goldstein, Secretary C. A S.

The Referee.
Another Guineas Day, at Caulfield, has added
its cold, damp, bitter memories to the annual sum of
punters’ misery, although the proportion of losers who
slouched off the premises with half-a-hundred weight of
mud hanging to each boot was rather less overwhelming
than usual. With tbe exception of Annesley every
winner had a fair sprinkling of friends outside stable, or
strictly local circles, and only the N.S.W. division seemed
to be “ getting it in the neck” to any serious extent. The
crushing defeats of Megaphone, Prelude and Whimbrel—
not to mention Titan’s utter disgrace—make the Rand-
wick “ form ” look poor in several places. On paper
the Ballarat colt, Annesley, is quite as fast as
Gibraltar, whilst The Admiral, who has developed
into a real dandy, seems good enough to have
won the A.J.C. Derby in the regulation “ walk.”
Taking a line through Gresford (whose second in the Caul-
field Stakes may have been scored on sufferance) the
Admiral is the best three-year-old brought out this
season as yet, and if his stable companion, The Spot, is
within seven pounds of Saturday’s hero, then Mr. Sam
Cook would appear to hold a double mortgage on the
V.R.C. Derby. It is early to talk about the Maribyrnong
Plate, but there can be no harm in advising punters to
find something very solid to go upon ere they look
away from Lord Hopetoun for a winner of the rich
juvenile flutter at Flemington. Lord Hopetoun, the colt,
is indeed a vastly different stamp of creature from his
vice-regal namesake, being bloodlike, most commandingly
built, and undoubtedly fast. When a youngster of
such size and style possesses a fine and always
ready turn of speed he usually keeps on running away
from rivals that have yet to grow up to him in bone or
muscle. Medina is a pony beside Lord Hopetoun, and
although the small and early sort are good ones to follow
it is a natural fact that the big and eai ly ones are better,
and better able to carry a penalty.
** T •
Owing to the woolly-headed drafting of the
Caulfield Cup conditions there was a good, seven-pounds
reason why intending candidates for next Saturday’s
handicap forgot to distress themselves unduly in
the Stakes. Nevertheless the running of Churchill,
Benzon, Tantallon, and others behind The Admiral,
was nothing in favour of their Melbourne Cup
chances, seeing that the Stakes would have served
as a genuine public trial for any horse whose owner
had the £lO,OOO race immediately in view. Which
point is worth noting, by the way. Perhaps the Caulfield
Cup'winner was out for an airing last Saturday, but more
likely perhaps it wasn’t. None of Cook’s handicap horses
showed, and there must be something dangerous in the
Admiral’s stable, surely. Chaldean was thought to be
winning the race last year when he broke a blood-vessel.
Tarcoola has been already backed heavily on the strength
of form which the publ’c have not yet seen. Chintz will
be backed before the day, if riot before this appears in
print, and Dunkeld is the horse that once ran a dead-heat
with Bravo, weight for age, at the heels of Carbine and
Dreadnought.
Until it has been decided to scratch Dunkeld
and save him for the longer race (which he is not exactly
built for), we shall expect that queer-tempered animal to
win the Caulfield Cup, With him numbered amongst the
dead or missing we would choose Chintz as a rational
medium fora modest “ quid” investment, giving her the
preference, if fit and well at the post, over Tarcoola or
Cook’s best. But horseracing, especially the racing in
which second-rate cattle have a show to win, is a risky
business anyhow, and one might do worse than put the
aforesaid sovereign on Plunger Brodribb’s chance of going,
so far as horse-racing is concerned, dead-broke by the end
of the blessed Melbourne carnival.
* # #
Not five hundred women in all, and none of
them dressed for the occasion, patronised Caulfield last
Saturday.
* • *
The artful cash metallician —the hoarse vampire
with a bag and a book, who raises his stentorian note on
the placewhere the turf is all worn away by human feet
—has invented a new swindle. When the unhappy flat
backs a horse this individual collars his money and gives
him a ticket, and then, under the old regime, he generally
got over a fence and ran till the wind was left behind,
and the miserable backer saw him no more. Now, how-
ever, he tries a different plan. When the winner presents
his ticket he takes it with a glad smile and feels in his
bag for the money. Then he notices something and
stops. “The flag" ain’t up yet,” he observes affably,
handing back the document; “ come hack in a minute.”
Only the ticket he hands back is a different one from the
ticket he just received, and when the holder presents it
again a few seconds later he rises with indignation
written large on his huge, flat countenance and demands
what in thunder this here game is meant for. The pro-
ceedings end there. There is no possible redress, and the
infuriated ticket-holder goes away and relieves his feelings
by a remark that sounds like “—— !!! d ? !
It is all the relief which the case admits of.
* # *
The attendance at the Melbourne Cup this year
will probably be smaller than at any time during the past
five years, for the strike has changed many people’s credit
balances into overdrafts. It is questionable if any of the
big sweeps, which owe their support in a great measure
to the working man, will fill this year.
# * *
The Australian Athletic Club offers £4OOO for
a Jackson-Slavin battle in their Darlinghurst Hall. It’s
nice and handy to the lock-up.
• * «
A number of Charters Towers men defrayed, by
a shilling subscription, the cost of a congratulatory cable;
gram to Slavin. The Bulletin will bet that Slavin replies
by mail—if he ever replies at all.
# # #
When Larry Foley is asked who is going to
win, Jackson or Slavin, he leans up against the wall and
eays, “I don’t believe, you see, they will ever fight.”
Then he goes on to explain, you see, that Jackson is a
fine boxer, and that Slavin has no doubt improved, you
see, and that Slavin might be afraid of Jackson as they
say he used to be, but then, don’t you see, Slavin can’t be
a very frightened fellow now. Larry gives so judicial a
statement of the case, and is so indefinite in his con-
clusions, that it all sounds like a S.M. Herald leader.
* * *
M‘Auliffe, the fallen ruin of the Pacific slope,
stated in print some time ago that after he had “ larded
the lean earth ” with Slay in’s remains he was “ going for
Jackson’s scalp.” He is now going to let Jackson keep
his scalp sine die.
* * *
The pugilists in Tom Sayers’ day battered one
another with bare fists, and resorted to hugging,
wrestling and heavy falls, one on top of another. Yet big
fights were very’ rarely decided in less than an hour or
two. Nowadays, championship matches with gloves on
are decided in a round or two, and are attended by sensa-
tional knockouts, unconsciousness, &c. Of course, these
are not always genuine. Formerly men depended on
hackers and had to fight in oaf best. Now they make a
good thing out of gate-money, and, arranging how this
shall be divided, they get through the remander of the
business with the least possible inconvenience to them-
selves.
* * #
Until a full account of the Slavin-M'Auliffe
affair comes to hand, it is hard to pass an opinion, but
from all accounts up to date it appears to have been a
blow-for-blow affair, and Slavin had the luck to get there
first.

Apparently there isn’t so much money in foot-
ball as one might suppose. For some weeks past reports
have been going round that the South Melbourne Club
received a fabulous sum from the bookmakers to lose a
recent match, and now it is explained that the only thing
ever given to the club in all its long career was a certain
brown hat which somebody donated to the captain. And
that gentleman reports regretfully that “ it was a devilish
poor brown hat, too.”

An English amateur high-jumper, named G.

In a twelve-mile foot-race, at Old Trafford,
Morton, of the Salford Harriers, beat Thomas, the Rane-
lagh Harrier, by 50 yards, in 1 hour and 3 minutes. This

have beaten it easily had he gone on when he rahll miles
932 yards in the hour.

George Ellis, the Sydney yacht-builder and
boat-sailer, took a boat and crew up to the Clarence
River Regatta just to show the natives a thing or two.
George, however, was beaten “ bad,” and he now says
arymnastics should be barred in boat-sailing. The lo :al
crew had each a rope fast to the masthead and when a
puff struck their boat they stood on the gunwale and
hung out almost horizontally with the aid of tneir mast-
head ropes.
* # *
It was at Carrington Grounds that a “gaffer ”
arranged with his man that he would give him the
“ office ” as to whether he was “to jig” or not by hold-
ing up a red handkerchief if the betting was good enough
for him to go, and a white if it was “ oronk." “ Gaffer ”
stood to win a big thing and wanted the heat won, but in
his excitement he pulled out the two handkerchiefs.
Here was a fix for the runner, but he w'as equal to the
occasion, and ran a dead-heat. Before it was run off he
knew how the wind blew, and won comfortably.

Australian Eleven Bailey, who is now in
Albany, W.A., piles up some wonderful scores against the
rustics. He is captain of the local eleven, goes in first
and carries out his bat. He is one of the most popular
men in the modest community of Albany. Duffy, atone
time ground bowler for the East Melbourne Club, and who
accepted engagement from the crack club of Perth,
W.A., has now severed his connection with the
metropolis, and will play with Albany during the coming
season.

The late James White’s horses sold well in Eng-
land. Captain Machell (one of the most astute turfmen
in England)bought Kirkham for 610 guineas; Mr. Swan
bought Narellan, 250 guineas (!); Mr. Douglas Baird, a
yearling by Martini-Henry— Prinoesse, 550 guineas; Mr.
Daniel Cooper, Wentworth, 1700 guineas; Mr. Daniel
Cooper,-Nepean, 350 guineas; Mr. Daniel Cooper, Mens
Meg, 2600 guineas. Lord Randolph Churchill offered, it
is said, 1600 guineas for Wentworth, presumably for
Baron Hirsoh, in whose racing affairs he has some
interest.
* * *
The eight to represent N.S.W. in the inter-
colonial eight-oar race has been picked, its chief oharac-
teristics being weight and new blood. The idea of
knocking a comparatively raw crew into intercolonial
shape by the 29th November is too ridiculous for com-
ment, and, as The Bulletin says year after year, it would
be better to allow the event'to fall through than to waste
time and money with the almost certainty of defeat. Mr.
James Oatley has shown himself to be the only coach able
to turn out a winning crew for N.S.W., and next year the
Rowing Association would do well to give him a free hand
in picking and handling the eight.
* * *
Ringmaster and Lady Betty have, been lately
scoring small wins in England—£loo plates and so on, of
the sort corresponding to Australian shearers’ meetings.

The “unknown” matched against Griffo turns
out to be an old hand, one Moran, who some time ago gave a
taste of his quality to the clever Jack Hall. The objections
of his family have since prevented him from showing pro-
minently before the public. He is the only stamp of man
to do the trick, for the Griflo-Jackson-Jem-Hall school
are almost invincible at out-fighting, and he gets close in.

If as good as repute makes him Choynski should
have little to fear from Fogarty. History shows that a
quick straight left has nothing to fear from a smashing
right. However, accidents will happen, and as Mace
experienced with Tom King, so Fogarty, vhen dead to
the world, may have a blow left in him like the kick of a
horse. „
# * #
In a set-to the other evening with the Champion
Amateur, Choynski showed himself to be a clever boxer.
He shapes much in the same style as his countryman,
Martin Costello, and appears to be far too clever to give
Fogarty much show of landing that auctioneer of his.
THE GREAT REMEDY FOR PAIN.
ST. JACOBS OIL.
WHAT IT IS.
SIX STANDARD VIRTUES.
Ist. It is in one word a cure ; it is not merely
a relief, and in no sense a cure-all ; it is the
product of scientific research.
2nd. It strengthens while it soothes and sub-
dues, heals, and cures ; it literally conquers pain.
3rd. Its effects are curative and permanent to
the whole group of muscular miseries and nervous
agonies.
4th. It does not merely irritate the outer
surface, nor does it merely soften or relax a con-
stricted muscle. To its specific action a superior
curative virtue is superadded.
sth. It penetrates deeply but gently; search-
ingly and surely seeking the pain spot in an effort
to conquer.
6th. Each constituent of the formula has a
recognised intrinsic virtue to serve most surely
the cure of pain.
For rheumatism, neuralgia,, sprains, bruises,
stiff joints, swellings, and similar ailments St.
Jacobs oil has positively no equal if used accord-
ing to the directions which accompany each bottle.
Aches and pains succumb in a truly marvellous
manner to the potent influence of this world-
famed remedy. Thousands of testimonials have
from time to time been published in the Austra-
lian press—testimonials from all ranks and_ con-
ditions of men —from statesmen, judges, eminent
divines, barristers, the medical profession, •mer-
chants, athletes, &c., and although a large stand-
ing reward has been offered to anyone who could
proof that any one of these was not strictly
genuine, none have dared to question their
authenticity. Under these circumstances is it to
be wondered at that the sale of St. Jacobs oil
greatly exceeds the combined sales of all other
advertised lotions, liniments, embrocations, &c.,
in the world. No home can afford to be without
a bottle of it always handy, and purchasers would
do well to observe that they get the genuine article
and not one of the many spurious preparations
made up to trade upon the enormous reputation
which St. Jacobs oil has built up for itself upon
the solid foundation of merit.
A PRACTICAL OPINION.
THE AGENT OF THE WATERBURY
WATCH CO.
Sir,—As I have carried a Waterbury Watch for
several years, and it has proven a most reliable
timepiece, I trust it will not be out of place for
me to express my opinion concerning these well-
known watches. I am a teacher, and could not
satis’actorily use a watch which could not be
depended upon for correct time and durability.
I have used at different limes several other watches
of different manufacture ; but have frequently re-
turned them for the best of reasons—they would
not run. Finally, my father (A. 0. Prescott,
jeweller, of Chateaugay, N.Y.) Obtained for me a
Waterbury, “ series J ” (short wind) saying he
knew from experience that would give satisfaction
in every way, and it has. The watch has not had
the best of care, I confess ; yet it is, without ex-
ception, the best timepiece I have seen. I have
no desire to exchange it for any other. * * *
Very sincerely,
Metta E. Prescott,
Chernbusco, Clinton Co., N.Y.
AT A TRIFLING COST
you can obtain a Waterbury watch, which rarely
gets out of order, and never constitutes itself a
permanent tax on the owner. In the event of
injury befalling it, by taking or sending it to the
Company’s Repair Depot, 56 Margaret-street, it
can be efficiently repaired at a nominal cost,
ranging, according to the extent of the damage,
from 6d. to 2s. 6d., but never exceeding the latter
amount unless by mutual consent. The genuine
Waterbury may be obtained from any respectable
storekeeper or dealer. Price, series “E ” (the old
favourite), 13s. 6d.; series “J" or “L” (the new
marvels), with enamelled dials, 225. 6d. each.
CAUTION. Intending purchasers of the
genuine article should note that all watches manu-
factured by the Waterbury Watch Co. have the
word “ WATERBURY ” printed in fine type on
the dial-face, and also the interlaced letters
“ W.W.C0.,” without which none are genuine.

Premier Macdonald, of Canada, who holds
that the passing of the M‘Kinley Tariff Bill is an
indirect Yankee effort to obtain possession of
Canada, expresses an opinion that_ the latter
country “ has nothing to gain by joining the
States with its mass of foreign ignorance and
vice.” The United States, no doubt quite pre-
pared to await the time when Canada will volun-
tarily join the Union, could, if it were worth
while, easily arrange to annex Canada by force of
arms _ w hich they will instantly proceed to do
when once it shall appear that British influence in
North America offers any menace to the Republic.

THE BULLETIN (Published at Sydney, N.S.W)
The Unique Weekly, Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
The Bulletin, the Premier Australian Literary
Journal, is the only paper which has a con-
sistent and distinctive Australian National
Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
Payment of Members
One Man, one Vote.
State Revenue derived directly from the Land.
Complete Secularisation of State Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
The Bulletin denounces—
Religious Interference in Politics.
Foreign Titles.
The Chinese.
Imperial Federation.
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the other half that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is- an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started seven years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become a vast property, because it pos-
sessed a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have, during the
last year, spent some thousands of pounds in
fitting their buildings with the latest appliances
fpr high-class printing and the production of illus-
trations, and they have now issued The Bulletin
in an entirely new form—printed with new type
of improved legibility on the finest paper, and
adorned with sketches from the hands of the
ablest and best-paid newspaper artists Australia
has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The voice of The Bulletin is the beacon-fire
of national progress : it is the forceful summons to
the crusade against the monopolies in land,
wealth, power, and privilege —the direct cause of
half the misery which now afflicts British
humanity. Against the claims of avaricious
clergy who claim to monopolise salvation, against
the dark despotism of grasping plutocrats, and
against the exercise of any human authority
which has not been granted by the people over
whom it is exercised, The Bulletin will fearlessly
and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pcarl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the New Zealand
Ranges. A paper which is at once the
most popular city publication and the organ of the
atelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
The circulation of The Bulletin in Sydney is
unrivalled by that of any other weekly journal,
and more than a hundred copies of it are sold in
Melbourne to one of any other paper printed out-
side that city. Perhaps the strongest proof of The
Bulletin’s popularity is found in the unchallenge-
able fact—easily ascertainable from any postal
official—that, of all journals issued in Australasia,
The Bulletin is the one most frequently re-
mailed from one reader to another.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

married him to spite Hartington, who was a
laggard in marriage though not a laggard in love,

only provided for the Duchess while she remains

myre, which should be a guarantee that clients will
be fairly dealt with. In these days of extortion, the
above institution should about fill a long-felt
want.*
The unsavoury Colonel Hughes-Hallet has
come to the front once more. In the summer
number of Piccadily he has above his name a
story entitled “ A Cut to Leg,” a crib as regards
plot and incidents, and to some extent words from
a yarn named “ The Leg,” a translation from the
German of Zsohodke, that appeared years ago in
Bentley’s Miscellany. The plot is sensational.
A young fellow had madly fallen in love with a
girl, and she with him, but she would not marry
him because she had only one leg. In order to
overcome the young lady’s scruples, the man
forced an eminent surgeon to amputate his own
right leg, The two were married; and the sur-
geon’s prophecy that his patient would repent
himself of his rash act was in the course of a few
years literally fulfilled.

Tales of “The System.”
No. XIV.—Janet Guilfoyle’s Delusion.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
On the afternoon of that March day in
|g3— # when Absalom Day obtained promotion to
the Principal Executionership of Van Diemen’s
Land by hanging 11 of the 12 prisoners who had
been capitally sentenced by the just-held Court of
Oyer and Terminer and Gaol Delivery (Judge—
the Honorable John Lewes Pedder ; Prosecutor
for the King’s Majesty—Attorney-General Alfred
Stephen) —Day himself, as some of our readers
may remember, was the twelfth man; on that
Monday, we repeat, the best and most select
circles of Hobart Town society were excited by
the news that Signal No. 12 was floating from the
flagstaff at Mulgrave Battery.
At this time marine signals interpreting a code
of a varied and comprehensive character, and
capable of providing for over 1500 distinct con-
tingencies (from the arrival of a Governor-General
to the escape of convicts in a stolen boat) were
sent to Mulgrave Battery by semaphore from
Mount Nelson, the eminence controlling the
channels by which the Derwent Estuary were
approached. When a signal was embraced within
the first 29 numbers of the code it was repeated to
the city from the Battery by flags. These “ bunt-
ing intonations,” as Colonel Arthur called them,
were confined to such announcements as might be
generally interesting to the people, and whose
promulgation would not trench upon the dignity
of the System or affect official privileges. The
semaphore signals actually in use numbered 346,
and, as we have indicated, could be made to express
over four times as many, so it will be observed
that whether the former number or the latter
be considered, the authorities did not show any
excessive generosity in communicating “signal
news” to the populace. But almost any item
of the intelligence was at the command of the
favoured beings who were included in Officialdom,
Thus, the majority of the people in Hobart
Town learnt simply from “No. 12 flag-signal”
that “a ship with female-convicts on board” was
approaching the anchorage. This bald statement
was, however, supplemented (for the benefit of
the inner and upper circles of Society) by a sema-
phore message.
The semaphore at Mount Nelson consisted of an
upright mast to which were attached three
revolving arms, one above the other. Each arm
could be fixed in six different positions, numbered
Ito 6. The upper arm denoted units ; the second
or middle one, tens; the third or lower, hundreds.
A ball hoisted on the mast would express 1000. A
similar instrument was erected at Mulgrave
Battery for communication with Mount Nelson;
but when the code signals were used first at the
Battery they became interrogatories.
The signal above described read “3-4-s”
“ three hundred and forty-fiveand “345 ” con-
veyed! to> the best and select aforesaid the eagerly-
lootes(3-foi; news that included in the cargo of the
incoming vessel were:
“ Many well-trained domestic servants.”
This was in reply to a question from the Battery
which had been instigated by the distressing
plight of certain refined official families.
* * *
There had been a shocking remissness, as
Hobart Town officialdom regarded it, on the part
of the Transporting authorities at “Home.” They
had not sent out more than one shipload of women
for nearly twelve months, and this circumstance
would have occasioned a dreadful deficiency in
the supply'of “ female labour under bond ” had it
stood alone. But it did not stand alone. These
shameless creatures, the bondwomen at service,
had magnified the trouble and subjected their
mistresses to unqualified distress by going out (as
we should now say) “on strike.” Almost to a
woman they had demanded an improvement in
the material conditions under which they did their
assignees or employers the honour of working.
The innocent doves insisted upon white sugar
being furnished with their hominy and their tea,
instead of the sweeter and more cloying “ brown
ration,” and the mistresses, however disposed they
may have been to acquiesce in the demand and to
welcome it as indicating a craving for more refined
habits of life, were compelled to refuse the con-
cession from sheer inability to procure the desired
article. They did their best to persuade the recal-
citrant dames and damsels to remain in their
several spheres of domesticity; but, lamentably
failing, they had been obliged to send batch after
batch of “refractories” to the Factory, and to
undertake the performance of their own house-
hold duties.
# # #
Even to the august kitchens of Govern-
ment House had the saccharine spirit of revolt
spread, and though the vice-regal menage was
fortunately situated, in that it was not abso-
lutely dependent on “bond” labour, yet it had
been so inconvenienced as to cause a postpone-
ment of the Governor’s annual dinner to the
Executive Council. Consequently, when the
Comptroller-General of Convicts, having paid his
humble duty to His Excellency, Colonel Arthur,
by informing him that a collection of more or less
murderous, bigamous and larcenous Abigails would
be awaiting His Excellency’s pleasure on the next
day, immediately after the delivery of his note,
received a command from the Governor to des-
patch at once a clerk to the vessel, the Arab (on her
third trip), to investigate the domestic qualifica-
tions of the cargo, he was not in the least surprised.
“It was just what he expected,” he told Mr.
Alfred Moyne, his principal free writer, as he
delegated him to visit the vessel; he thought
“ the old man would want his pick first,” and as
this meant that the whole lot of new arrivals
would have to be kept in durance, pending the
trial by the Governor’s housekeeper of the first
and, perhaps, successive detachments of hand-
maids, he was greatly put about by the impos-
sibility of obliging the wives of the military and
official dignitaries till after the vice-regal require-
ments had been satisfied. “Thirty requests in
already,” he grumbled, “for one hundred and
eighty women, and the townspeople and settlers
don’t know yet about there being any labour
available, and this is without counting what the
Governor wants, and Judge Pedder and myself.
Why, I want five! And I’ll wage a dollar there
Won’t be a hundred assignable women on the ship.
Whenever you want female labour, the Home
Government will either send you none at all or
else a lot of wretches who need shaving* regularly.
It’s a confoundedly thoughtless proceeding on the
part of those fellows at home. They don’t con-
sider us here in the least.”
If you think of it, it was particularly outrageous
of His Majesty’s Judges and High Sheriffs to pay
so little attention to the necessities of the colonial
“ female labour ” market. They would have
shown a juster respect for the conditions of the
colony (and the convenience and comfort of its
Officialdom) had they indicted and transported
fewer men and more women. The Colonial
Administration did its best to correct the dis-
crepancy between the sexes as expressed in the
Returns of Convict Strength by occasional mas-
sacres, such as had marked that March morning,
but still a huge difference remained which no
possible number of executions could get over. No,
the Imperial authorities did not “ send out ” half
women enough.
# * #
All the same, had the Comptroller wagered
his dollar, he would have lost it. Not that he
would have minded much ; he always paid his lost
bets in Spanish dollars, for he bought a lot of
them cheap when Governor Arthur’s “Sterling
Money Act ” had thrown them out of currency ;
though when he won he insisted on payment in
sterling. He would have lost, inasmuch as thecargo
of the Arab (3rd) included by far the largest
proportion of “ assigned women ” ever brought out
by one ship. Out of 132 women shipped, as per
manifesto, but a paltry ten could be truly said to
be incapable of assignment. And of these seven
were dead and two were in the sick-bay. Quite a
very phenomenal proportion ! It did not make
matters any the easier for the Comptroller that
the circumstances were so exceptionally pleasant.
He reflected that it would increase his perplexity
and the sum total of the annoyance which he
would create, for as soon as it became known that
the Arab’s cargo was a superlatively modest,
chaste and domestic one, applications for the
coveted hand maidens would multiply exceedingly
and the resulting discontent at his allotment
would increase in a direct ratio to the number of
his refusals.
Particular trips of particular ships gave the
vessels reputations, and transferred their odour to
their individual lumps of humanity which they
bought out. No employer, not belonging to the
brute class, would have anything to do with a
male convict ex the Marquis of Huntley (1), or
Lady Kennaway (2.) Every master wanted a
Medway man. So with the women. To engage
a female transport per Hector was to hire a she-
devil ; to obtain a Morley girl who had come out
under good Dr. Reid (whose essay on “Seduc-
tion” is one of the most humorous chapters in
the English language) and had not gone, into the
Parramatta factory, was to win a treasure. And
now the Arab (3) was about to discharge—if the
report of the Comptroller’s clerk Mayne was to be
believed —a hundred and over “Angels of the
house,” the stains on whose reputations had rather
the effect of old-fashioned beauty spots on
dimpled cheeks than otherwise. Moral pecca-
dilloes brought into view undeniable points
of excellence in those women’s characters
when regarded as domestic accessories. Had
the compiler of the semaphore code foreseen the
arrival of the beauties of Arab (3) he would have
coded a special signal, say No. 1666, have put a
ball over the three arms in the sixth position, and
have made them read ; “ A majority of the women
aboard are model domestics. ”
Now, the Arab had barely dropped her pilot in
the Channel when her skipper and her surgeon-
superintendent agreed that no vessel ever built
had ever carried a bigger cargo of feminine villainy.
She had not loosed her grapnels from the penal
hulk at Portsmouth before the convicts began
their oantraps and tantrums; before the Biscay
was crossed one-half of the sailors had been
seduced from their allegiance to the captain and
had to be placed in irons by the other half-, who
performed the work of incarceration with the
greater pleasure as it left themselves a freer field
with the women- One day, off the Azores, the
skipper loaded aSx- pounder and forced its muzzle
into the main hold where the prisoners mostly
■congregated, and gave them two minutes to stop
their devils’ riot or be fired upon. And yet, long
before they rounded the Cape of Good Hope, the
Arab’s cargo had become mild, tractable, patient,
tearful—in a word, woman-like. The miserable
creatures re-donned their sex. And weeks before
the Iron Pot was sighted they became “ models.”
Would you learn how the transformation was
effected ? By the agency of a simple and pure
English lady.
* # *
Janet Guilfoyle, by special permission of
Lord Glenelg, Secretary of State for the
Colonies, had been granted a passage on board
the Arab. Nourished on the graceful pro-
prieties, and moulded by the wholesome conven-
tions of a refined, though far from wealthy home,
the first seventeen years of her life had flowed in
a calm, passionless current. But in her nine-
teenth year Love had disturbed her peace. She
had given her deepest affections to gay, dashing,
reckless Philip Grafton, who claimed distant
■cousinship with her mother. And then the bitter
shame and humiliation that follow upon the
wrong-doing of a loved object was added to her
emotional experience. Grafton gambled—lost—
■obeyed one of those momentary impulses to crime
which have ruined more souls and lives than
courses of deliberately-planned vice—and fell into
the meshes of the law. He forged a bill of
■exchange. Eauntleroy had been hanged, but the
Act 2 and 3 Will. IV., c. 44, which abolished the
■capital punishment for the crime, had not yet been
passed. “ Influential connections,” however,
saved Grafton’s neck for the time being, and his
sentence was commuted to transportation for life.
The Pyramus, convict transport-ship, had carried
him to Van Dieman’s Land, and thither the
slender-formed, sweet-faced* brave-hearted girl,
whose love he had won, followed him as soon as
the last tie which held her to England had been
parted by her mother’s death.
s- * *
One of the characteristics of Janet’s love
for Grafton was, in its later developments,
singular enough. She was impelled to include
within the circle of her devotion almost every
species of criminal. From the hypocritical
schemer who was created in hundreds by the
Home Penal System she alone held aloof. A
glib recitation of Bible-texts might be a passport
to chaplains’ approval and prison privileges, but
found no applauding echo in the heart of the
refined girl who, after Grafton's exile, so
frequently walked on missions of mercy the
noisome corridors of Newgate ; who relieved the
crowded solitudes of Millbank with her smile ;
and who exhaled the fragrance of her pity in the
fearful yards of Giltspur-street, Compton. She
gave most of her gracious presence to the last-
named gaol. Perhaps it was that the gaol at that
time was the vilest in London—it was before the
rule of Mr. Teague, the humane governor, on
whose death, in ’4l, every prisoner wore a token
of mourning ; but most likely it was because it
was in this gaol that her lover had been confined
when waiting trial. Grafton was ever present to
her thoughts ; she ministered to him when she
ministered to others ; and when she applied the
tender admonishment and the pained rebuke, and
sought by wise counsel to strengthen the feeble
and to weaken the obdurate, she mingled with her
womanly offices the prayer that, in the distant
Penal Settlement some such spirit as her own
might be in like manner aiding the erring soul of
her lover. She chided herself sometimes, that in
such ministrations there was an element of selfish-
ness ; for was she not tending the object of her
love with whom her own hopes were bound up, in
serving these offenders against the law ? Selfish
or not she was welcomed to the gloomy cells and
awful court-yards of the London prisons as
though she were a visitant from another sphere,
and as a daughter of a race to whom the tragi-
comedy of human life was unknown. And when,
on her mother’s death, she resolved to seek the
new world —“that glad new world in which,” as
Lord Stanley put it, “every transported offender
might, if he so choose, fall on his feet”—men who
were indurated by crime-shed tears.
One such wretch, as he lay doubly-ironed on a
Newgate pallet under commital for “returning
from transportation ” —he had been concerned in
the seizure of the Cyprus in 1829, and had been
identified in Thames Police Office, by old Capon,
the Hobart Town gaoler, who chanced to be in
London at the time—had begged her to go out in
a convict-ship. “ Most on them vessels, Miss, are
jest floatin’ hells. I’d sooner be ’anged ’ere in
Lunnun then go back in ’un, if I were to get
freedom th’ moment as I landed.” And the
“ hardened wretch,” as the newspapers called him
in describing his appearance on his trial, shuddered
at his recollection of a transport’s infamies. “Go
out, Miss, as a pass’nger,” he besought her, with a
piteous earnestness. “ An’ th’ doctor —th’
doctor’s chief man aboard, yer know, when
pris’ners’ concerned—an’ th’ skipper’ll let yer
do as yer like ’mong th’ men, if you’ll
be pleasant and sweet in th’ cabin. An’ 1 knows
as yer’ll be thet any w’ere’s, Miss. Don’ yer be
’fraid, Miss, o’ th’ men. I knows ’em. Miss—
th’biggest devil o’ th’ lot ’ll shet up, Miss, w’en
yer by. Yer can lead th’ biggest bla’g’rd w’en yer
can’t drive th’ smallest. Thet’s th’ mistake th’
Systum makes, Miss—it drives, an’ drives, an’
prods, an’prods, an’ never leads. Th’ Systum
won’t hev it as we’ve got feelin’s, an’ it makes a
terrible mistake. W’y, I knows a man as was wi’
me at Macquarie Harbour—never ’erd o’ th’ Hell
o’ Macquarie Harbour, hev yer, Miss ? —who they
flogged till he ’ad over a thousan’ cuts o’ th’ cat;
nine thousan’ cuts, Miss —’polojisen fur speakin’
o’ sech thin’s ter a youn’ leddy, Miss —an’ they
c’u’dn’t get him ter do nothink, an’ ’un day
’Sistant-Com’sary Lemfrere —a real w’ite man he
is, Miss —gives him a kin’ word, an’ wot do he do,
d’yer think, Miss ?” The hardened villain paused
for a reply, and as the girl—shuddering and
trembling at this glimpse of the horrors of the
“glad new world” —answered that she did not
know, he followed up his speech by the pregnant
sentence:
“ Thet night he prayed fur th’ Com’dant! ”
Janet Guilfoyle could not know how great was
the renunciation of revenge expressed by the
simple sentence. The “hardened villain, ’ how-
ever, understood that before a Macquarie Harbour
felon could so abnegate his convict-self, he had to
undergo his “ probation.”
# * *
So it came about that Janet Guilfoyle
obtained a passage on board the Arab. She could
have voyaged, had she so chosen, on a “male
convict-ship,” but one experienced in the character
of the creatures with whom the System had to
deal, urged her to go with a women’s vessel.
“Go,” he said, and he looked at her meaningly,
“go, and stand between your wretched sisters and
the officers and crew of the ship.”
She went.
* * *
A sickness prostrated her for many days,
and it was not until the day after the officers had
run out the carronade which commanded the
prison-hold, that she was sufficiently recovered to
venture among the screeching-women.
They welcomed her in language that was
decidedly characteristic of the System which had
just taken them under its sheltering wing;
characteristic as it was unreportable; and there-
fore, like so many other features of the System,
to be expressed only by the ingenious vacuity of
a and a tantalising mystery of a series of
* * * She listened to them, and nothing but
her heightened colour indicated that she was not
deaf. And a second and a third visit she made
them, and they gave to her the same coarse
•salutations.
On the fourth. day they had prepared a little
tableau for her edification. Two strapping damsels
were “ put up ” (with the matron’s connivance) to
“ have it out ” in the presence of the young
passenger. They had previously quarrelled and
had displayed a strong mutual desire “ to go for ”
each other’s hair and eyes with tooth and nail.
“ Stow yer temper, gals,” advised Matron
Matthews, “till the cabin Miss comes down, and
then hev it out like men.” With an amiable
deference to authority, which should have been
charming under the circumstances, the warring
fair ones agreed to postpone their encounter till
Janet appeared.
As she stepped to the gangway the next fore-
noon, they threw off their print prison dresses.
A strict regard for mirth forbids us recording that
they were still (in Godiva fashion) “clothed with
chastity neither were they like Venus who, free
and unshackled by costume, retained her cestus ;
as a simple fact, one wore nothing but- a smile
(directed at Miss Guilfoyle) and the other a
frown (charged with hatred of her opponent).
The pure-eyed, clean-soufed girl stopped short
in the gangway. In the waist were congregated
almost the whole prison cargo, with the Matron —
“ a conscientious monitress ” is her official charac-
ter—and her dozen convict-warders setting an
example to the prisoners by joyous laughter and
merry exclamations.
The soldier-sentry was facing inwards and he
grinned in company till he caught sight of Miss
Guilfoyle, and then his cheeks flushed vividly.
Save that warmth of tint, there was no other sign
of modesty visible on the deck if we except Janet
herself.
Everyone—pugilists, matron, sentry, prisoners
—thought the girl would retire in horror. After
one swift moment of self-communion she came to
the decision that to accept the insult would be to
resign all chance of influencing the creatures who
could thus libel their sex. So she resolved to
disappoint them, though to her dying day she
never recalled the incident without being pene-
trated with shame. For the first and last time in
her life she played the hypocrite.
She moved forward and said, in tones suggestive
of a deep solicitude: “My dears, will you not
catch cold ?” As she spoke she gathered up the
dresses and threw them loosely over the Amazons.
“In this climate one gets so soon chilled,” she
went on ; “ You should really take more care of
yourselves ! ”
The would-be fighters shrank back into the
ranks of their sisters in sin, amidst screams of
laughter which were certainly not directed at
Janet. 'Arid so the latter got her footing among
these shameless parodies of their sex.
By a happy inspiration, Janet had been in-
duced to purchase several of the familiar English
song-birds to take with her on the voyage. Gold-
finches, linnets, blackbirds, whitethroats, queen-
finches and skylarks, a wren and a thrush, had
been shipped, and their cages, with the captain’s
consent, had been placed in the cabin. It was in
November that the boat sailed, and only the wren,
the blackbird and the thrush were in voice.
Nevertheless, the Surgeon-Superintendent and the
first-mate even complained of the twittering of
the birds, and the captain suggested that Miss
Guilfoyle should hang up the cages in her own
cabin. She could accommodate but two of the
tiny boxes in her own, narrow berth, and as the
Surgeon-Superintendent was practically master of
the ship, and he objected to let the other cages be
hung anywhere “within his domains,” she had
no alternative but to free all the poor, feathered
things, except the blackbirds and the. thrush, in
the wastes of the mid-sea. An act of wanton
cruelty, you will say. For its explanation you
have but to look at the character of the Surgeon-
Superintendent and the offi«ers. With no other
word or action (save that hereinafter mentioned)
to reveal that she suspected aught, the girl-pas-
senger had put a very decided stop to their
“ little games.”
The practices thus sportively denominated were
monotonously immoral. For every man like
Doctors Browning and Reid, whom the System
employed to supervise the physical and moral con-
dition ( vide “ Instructions to Surgeon-Superin-
tendent”) “of female transports,” she employed a
score like the Surgeon of the Arab—a man who
was not a pimp and a pander, simply because he
was a principal.
Over the “female transports” on board the
Arab, Janet gradually threw the segis of her own
innocence, an innocence which was something
very different from ignorance. Had she been
ignorant of the dreadful knowledge which the
System began to teach its children the moment
they were “celled ” on the Portsmouth hulks, she
could have never done the good she did in after-
years. The brave, whole-hearted men and women
of the pattern of Chaplain Taylor and Janet
Guilfoyle, who fought the System inch by inch
and hour by hour, preserved their purity uncon-
taminated amid more than Corinthian horrors.
Notwithstanding, they had to keep their purity
informed. The ignorant was a fool, and a fool was
powerless for anything save evil. When the-true
history of Australasia is written, the historian
will discover that the fools were clothed with gold
lace and in bishop’s lawn. The people who saved
Australasia from a Dead Sea-doom were not seated
in high places.
“A Dead Sea doom? What nonsense!”—ls
it? You don’t know! Marcus Clarke said once
that the men and women who had preserved “this
Newer Britain of the Golden South ” from
becoming a moral desolation, could be counted on
the fingers, “ and all of them had been in constant
conflict with the Penal System.” The System’
tried to crush them. One of these women was
Janet Guilfoyle. _ ‘
We are not telling here the story of her conflict
with Surgeon SHngsby and Matron Matthews;
we may do so hereafter; but now we will say no
more than that they would have won the battle,
but for the thrush.
The doctor gleefully told Mrs. Matthews how
he had compelled that “d young madam ”
to sacrifice her birds, and the female instrument
of the System had chuckled her congratulations.
She was really rejoiced at “ thetimpident miss’s ”
discomfiture; and with good reason, for she was
gi’eatly suffering in pocket by Janet’s interference
with the women. Till that had happened 1 Mat-
thews was doing almost as good a business as her
famous sister-matron, who, the day after her
vessel’s arrival at Hobart Town, presented in the
proper quarter orders from all the ship’s crew,
and from several of the military guard for then-
wages and pay. And, what was 'more, she pet
them paid. The System had some curious ways in
those days. ,
“ Did she cry, doctor?” enquired the procuress.
“ her, no !’,’ replied Slingsby. “ 1 thought
she would, but she kept the waterworks locked.
All she said was—" Doctor, have you forgotten
that letter ?’ ”
“Curse her for a spy !” venomously exclaimed
sweet Matron Matthews.
* # *
Lord Glenelg’s secretary had written a note
to Miss Guilfoyle, which accompanied the official
permission to voyage by the convict-ship, in which
he requested her—“as. a personal favour to
acquaint his Lordship direct with her opinion bf
the routine maintained on transport-vessels.
The doctor had read this note by the lanterh-
light at 2 a.m.
He was passing into “the women’s deck”
shortly before that hour one night (as surgeon he
had access at all times) in company with the first
mate, whose deck-watch it was. They were pass-
ing, with unshod feet, between two rows of ham-
mocks when they came face to face with Janet,
“You here, Miss Guilfoyle!” Slingsby cried,
To which she made no answer.
“ I’m just going to see Spriggs ” (a convict who
had been ill) “ she wants to see me,” he went on,
“I’ve been sitting by Sprigg’s'hammock since-
nine o’clock,” Janet said, “ and you have not been
sent for. In any case, the chief officer has no*
business here. Now, gentlemen; come with me !■”'
They followed her sleepishly past the-grinning
sentry—his grog was stopped nex-tdhy inpayment
of that smile—to the cabin. She craved them to*
excuse her a moment, andi on her return handed
the doctor the Secretary ofi State’s letter,
“Shall I endorse this?” she enquired, with the-
remark that “it is. a custom with surgeon-super
intendents, ships’ officers and crew to visit the
women’s quarters at all hours of the night.”'
Moral Supervisor Slingsby had taken the hint.
* * *
The conversation between the Surgeon
and the Matron took place in the “waist ” of the
vessel one hot December day as the Arab was
nearing the tropics. It was overheard by a group
of the prison inmates. One of the women asked
Miss Guilfoyle why she had not sent the birds to
the quarter's. She replied that she would have
done so but she was sure the Surgeon or the
Matron would have wrung their necks. Singing-
birds formed no part of the Routine ; nothing
humanising ever did, not even by accident; and
Janet could not well have reported the destruction
of the choristers in such a case. Better, she had
thought to free them; they had then an infinitesi-
mal chance of life; the doctor would have given
them none.
“ Yer ain’t got no more, ’avyer, Miss Guilfoyle?
Yer might give us one, if yer’av—we’ll take care
nobody wrings its neck—won’t we, pals?” cried a
case of infanticide—a very bad case.
There was a chorus of assent, with the grim
addition :
“We’d [wring Slingsby’s neck first, afore he
he should tech it; so go an’ tell yer cully that,
Mother Mathews.” (The Matron had come up to
the talking group, “jest to see wot mischief thet
blower was ‘bout,” as she told Slingsby, later.>

And there wu precious little doubt that they
Janet took her thrush to the quarters that after-
noon. The bird, at the beginning of the voyage,
was in the last stage of its autumnal song, but
apparently it had resolved not to lapse into its
winter-muteness. Its sea-trip had confused its
calendar, and, instead of fading into silence, its
notes thrilled with a more rapturous fulness as the
vessel glided into warmer latitudes. It linked the
Spring of the Old World to the Summer of the
New one with a chain of joyous melody, and its
quivers sent countless gleams of Spring weather
into hearts frost-bitten with crime.
The creatures crowded round Janet as she
carried the cage into their midst. It twitted and
tweeted merrily for a few minutes, and then burst
out with rapid notes. .
“ Listen to it,” cried a London girl-a smart
pickpocket. “ Listen to its ‘ Pretty Dick, Pretty
Dick ! ’ ”
“Pretty Dick, ye gowk ye,” shouted a Scotch-
woman, the glint of a teardrop shining in her eye ;
“ it doesna’ say Pretty Dick ! Hark to it ! And
she echoed its song : “Broo thick, broo thick, stir
about, stir about, free it, free it.” Often in the
hamlet home of her youth, and before she had
wended to the city with its devious ways and
deadly pitfalls, she had listened to the thrushs
reminder that the broth was thick and needed
stirring and tasting. The bird’s trill bore on its
accents the breath of the moorland breeze, the
bloom of the gorse, and the chat by the ingle
and Scotch Bet, drunkard and bigamist, was
moved to throw herself on the deck and to cover
her touzled head with her skirt while she wept
her heart out. Scotch Bet was one of the worst
cases on the ship. She had been placed on half
rations nineteen times during the voyage already
—not that she suffered by the deprivation-the
punishment only put her to the trouble of stealing
some weaker sister’s portion. But there was just
one corner of her nature that had not turned to
stone, and the thrush’s song penetrated to the
s P ot
From that hour the discipline of the
prison-ship was almost perfect. There was only
»ne other outburst, which happened the very next
day. Slingsby, on his rounds, ordered the removal
of the bird. The transports made one rush at
him, and a few minutes later a oapless, jacketless,
shirtless fellow was rescued by the sentry from a
heap of scratching and shrieking viragos. He
put every woman Jill of the convicts on bread-
and-water for a fortnight, and ordered the warders
to apprehend the ringleaders. The penalty the
prisoners did not mind in the least, as they had
gained their end, and had bestowed a much-
needed drubbing on the doctor; _ and as to the
warders, the handcuffs they carried were looked
on themselves.
The Moral Supervisor appeased Ins dignity by
threatening Miss Guilfoyle. “I’ll report you,
madam, for interfering .with routine, and stirring
up a revolt—l’ve got a good mind to put you m
irons ” he roared. Unto which bluster, she had
replied unaffectedly that he must have forgotten
Lord Glenelg’s letter. Would he like to peruse
it again ? It was quite at his service.
It is to be inferred, however, that he enjoyed a
revenge. A few days subsequently, on going into
her cabin, Janet found the door of her blackbirds
cage open and the birds gone. The port-hole was
open also, though she had closed it not an hour
before to keep out the spray.
# # *
She did not give the women the thrush
but she lent it, in periods of three days, to the
messes in turn. Bad conduct on the part of any
member of the mess would deprive that particular
lot of the privilege in the next round. However,
she promised the bird at the end of the voyage to
the prisoner to whom a ballot should award it, but
any offence in the interim was to render the
offender ineligible for the possession of the tiny
chorister. The plan worked to a charm. Bven
essentially criminal natures who had seldom
known any other home than the Penitentiary
softened under the effect of voluntary restraint.
If they did not covet the bird for themselves—
there were a few who did not do so they were
anxious to retain the privilege for their mess.
Two or three women with “ thoroughly hardened
and reprobate” against their names in the
“ Hulks Conduct Sheet ” fought against this in-
fluence as reckless and despairing characters
always do tight against good, not so much from
depravity as from pride—creatures who thought
that to be right-doing was to be weak —but one by
one they gave up opposition in action if not in
speech. And the bird’s song fluttered about them
all at their work, at their exercise, at their
mockery of recreation. It served them as their
reveille, for it gave voice before the morning
musket shot rang out, and it twittered
and tweeted good-night as they tumbled
into their hammocks at sunset. Miss Guilfoyle
sang to them daily, now a hymn like Bishop Ker s
dear old invocation :
“Awake, my soul, and with the sun,"
now some sweet Fnglish favourite, such as Oldy s
“Busy, Curious, Thirsty Fly,” and now some
wondrous effect of Handel or Mozart, and the
thrush trilled a treble to her contralto. It blessed
bhem with the peace of far-off woodland glades,
and taught them in the notes it sent through its
prison-bars the one lesson they needed to learn
that God does not forsake the captives.
A girl of eighteen lay dying of consumption in
her hammock one day as the Arab was rounding
the Cape-Rebecca Smith, transported for seven
years. She asked Miss Guilfoyle to let her hold
the thrush’s cage a moment. “I’m so fond o
birds, mem,” she pleaded. “ I was sent for them
—I was a slavey, mem —an’ I prigged an aif-
crown to buy a goldfinch. Oh, an it did sing so,
mem —it was ’evin to me, it was, for lend never
get to church—an’ then missus missed Hi’ mopus.
an’l was lagged. My ’finch, mem, it, ud' beat
this holler in singiu’, mem —it ud indeed, but
this is sweet too, isn’t it.” And she kissed the
cage —and, not long afterwards, died.
• * *
On the ship’s approach to the Derwent,
and at the very hour that the Mount M ilson
signalman was ’ agitating Hobart lown society
with the interesting intelligence of her arrival,
the ballot for the bird took place. Janet wrote
ten score names on as many slips of paper, and
let Scotch Bet draw one. Bet could read, and
quickly unfolded the slip and glanced at the name.
When she saw it was not her own, she fell to
swearing (she had not sworn for many days), and,
running to the bulwarks, and tearing the paper as
she went, she threw the fragments
“No one shall ken,” sheened. I will na speak.
And as no inducement could obtain the informa-
tion from her, the lot had to be re-drawn. Janet
said that she would find out the missing name by
going over the slips remaining, but Bet foiled her
again. She clutched a handful of the papers and
scattered them overboard.
On the second ballot the bird was won by one of
the shameless pugilists. “ 111 Kjoye a hve-pun
note, lassie, for it," offered Bet. Th ovvd doctor
has my siller. Wull ye?” The girl clutched the
cage and shook her head. “ Then dang ye for a
soor sinner,” cried Bet. „
The same night, their last aboard ship, Jtset
troubled in conscience—Bet never knew she had
such a thin? till the thrush revived it—confessed
to Jess the Romany that it was she, Jess, whose
name was on the first drawn slip. Jess was the
woman who had threatened Slingsby’s neck with
a wringing, was a genuine gipsy, having been a
rninkler’s bewr* —she was under sentence of exile
for “gladdher ”+ —she could use her fists effectively,
and in the seclusion of the quarters, she bestowed
upon Bet a pair of black eyes and then cried her-
self to sleep.

The day succeeding the Arab’s arrival oft
Hobart Town, Chaplain Ford went on board to
perform his duty—and to bespeak a cook. As
Senior-Chaplain he had to report on the spiritual
condition of the new arrivals.. The Surgeon-
Superintendent being ashore, the captain referred
him to Miss Guilfoyle. “Though I know its
very irregular, sir, she being nothing but a pas-
senger, yet I must say she has done the gir.s some
good. Look at ’em now, sir.”
Round Janet were gathered most of the
prisoners. She was preparing to go ashore, and
was bidding them kindly and tearful adieux.
“Not farewell, girls, for be sure I’ll see you
again.” Most of the women were sobbing bitterly.
The chaplain had an hour’s talk with her. She
told him of her experience with the women, with-
out reflecting upon Slingsby. .
“ Oh, it’s all nonsense,” he exclaimed brusquely,
with reference to her account of the thrush s
influence—“ all nonsense. Nature, God’s handi-
work, you know, never had any genuine influence
over prisoners—they’re too hardened. Why, a
case in point occurred only yesterday. We hanged
eleven men, you know, yesterday morning
“ What!” cried Miss Guilfoyle, shocked.
“Eleven men—oh, that’s nothing. Well, one
of the eleven was a fellow who always pretended
to love Nature—used to get flogged because he cl
stop in his work and look at the sky or pluck
flowers—that w. etch murdered a man, and went
so far as to insult me on the scaffold. No, your
notion is quite erroneous ! ”
“Surely,” she said, softly, “there must have
been some good in that poor man, else he would
never have risked being punished for the sake of a
flower.” . , , , .
“ Oh, I can assure you you’re under a delusion.
Grafton was quite a scoun ”
“Whom did you say?” the girl cried, and
clutched his arm.
“Grafton, Philip Grafton.”

he belongs to no party, and that if certain tendencies r •

“ The English Rose ” is a crib from a MS. translation of a
French pfay he lent to Buchanan, and which the latter
failed to return, Buchanan coolly threatens to print Cole-

latter, a poor man, of all chance of production. By the

During Barry Sullivan’s very first engagement at me
Melbourne Royal, Henry Neil Warner-an actor a few
people considered equal to Brooke- was playing seconds.
At a rehearsal of “The Lady of Lyons,” in which ho
played Damas, Warner was half-an-hour late—a not
unusual thing with him. Sullivan, who at this time
thought everybody looked down upon him (Ambrose
Kyte had not taken him in hand as yet), was very hasty,
and grumbled at the delay caused. “Oh ! said Warner,
who hated Sullivan like poison, “ don’t bother; I know
thfe piece backwards.” “Ah!” said B. S., in his deepest
tones, “ that may be, but, then, we don t play it back-
wards at this theatre under this management. Warner,
at night, took a petty revenge by not “playing up” to
Sullivan.
The S.M. Herald’s London correspondent says that

don’t alter for the better now he is home, he will go back
to Australia again. At this dreadful prospect we writhe

Hubert O’Grady must needs make a foolishly-impudent
speech at the end of the “ Famine ” and frost at Melbourne

“Sorcerer” ran for three nights, played with distin-

The popular liquor —Wolfe’s Schnapps.

Wolfe’s Schnapps should be in every house.
There are 27 Water Supply trusts and 45
Waterworks trusts in Victoria. The number of
whisky trusts is nil. Trust is dead with the pubs.
If asked to drink, call for Wolfe’s Schnapps.
Walter Besaut, in “All Sorts and Con-
ditions of Men,” page 147, says : —
After all it doesn’t matter—nobody cares what happens
to a junior clerk. There are plenty more, and the work-
house is said to be well managed. Perhaps they will let
me keep their accounts There are in every
civilised country, thousands and thousands of these help-
less and hopeless creatures: they suffer in silence, . . .
They have not even the energy to make a union : they
have not the sense of self-protection.
An exhilarating cordial is Wolfe’s Schnapps.
A recent writer says: —“Love, not law,
creates the husband and the wife. If the law says
nay to this, so much the worse for the law.
Bigamy may be a protest against statutes ; adul-
tery often is. We sometimes think, too, that
religion is rather the outcome of a social condition
than a force in the world-life. And we dream of
a day when the world will value a single human
heart higher than anybody’s opinions or any
people’s laws.”
You really ought to drink Wolfe’s Schnapps.
Bonython, of the S.A. Advertiser, the

an English paper, that the Bonythons were about
at the time of the flood, but happened to be away
in the hills. He purchased the historic mug at
a cost of several hundred pounds as an heirloom,
and now keeps the earthenware atrocity amongst
his Lares and Penates. Bonython got religion in
the Wesleyan church under the wing of holy John
Cotton, and used to be a political prop to that
patriarchal politician when he rose in the Adver-
tiser office.
Wolfe’s Schnapps will make you a new man.

The Land of the Crocodile.
Leichardb’s last letter was dated April 4,
1848, from M‘Pherson’s Station on the Cogoon.
From there he “vanished trackless into blue
Immensity,” like La Perouse and other lost
explorers. I heard a weird story of one of the
brave old pioneers of the Far West. He was
living at the time on the Cogoon, in the midst of
hostile blacks. His sole companion was k< Jack”
the hut-keeper. Stuart Russell, the author of the
“ Genesis of Queensland,” called at the station.
During mealtime he saw Brown sitting with a
pistol on each side of the table in front. Jack
came in carrying a dishin one hand and a toma-
hawk in the other. The pistols and the tomahawk
were never abandoned for a moment. Next day
Brown was out on the run and Jack came in to
the hut with his tomahawk. Russell asked him
the reason. “ Oh,” said Jack, “ Brown’s out to-
day ! He’s as mad as blazes and wants to shoot
me, but I’ll brain him first with the tomahawk !”
Next day Russell asked Brown why he always
kept his pistols on hand, and he replied : “That
infernal hut-keeper is mad, and watches for a
chance to kill me with that tomahawk ; but I’ll
shoot him dead first!” Here were two men,
living a lonely life far out beyond the confines of
civilisation, surrounded by blacks ever on the
alert for murder, each man believing the other to
be mad, and each on guard determined to be the
first to kill! It was truly a strange scene,
darkened by a shadow of Dantean gloom, but
comical enough now with the tragic element
softened by the white mists of intervening years.

Jack Hamilton, M.L.A., is COiiimanciei-
in chief of the special constables in Brisbane. He
is, doubtless, much disgusted _ that, so far, there
has been no bloodshed. Jack is a born gladiator,
If he could only wade in somebody’s gore, it
would matter little to him whether it belonged to
the employer or the employed. An old digger told
me a funny story about Jack in the Palmer days.
Jack had a special aversion to a Chinese store-
keeper who was a very objectionable class of person
altogether, and likewise extremely superstitious,
Jack solemnly informed this nervous celestial that
he had a dream in which Confucius or Mencius
or some other Chinese philosopher came and told
him that the devil would call on the Chinaman on
the following evening. The following night Jack
arrayed himself in a weird and fearsome costume,
painted his face in fanciful patterns and sur-
mounted his head with the tail of a gray horse.
He looked like nothing more than one or those
blood-curdling apparitions we see in the worst
class of nightmare. This ghastly phantom walked
softly into _ the Chinaman’s shop and gazed at
Wooing Hing across the counter. At the same
time it emitted a laugh like that of an old hyena,
Wooing Hing rose slowly and deliberately, his
mouth opened about two feet, his eyes dilated to
the size of saucers, and his colour that of a green
pumpkin. He just smiled one brief horror-stricken
smile, uttered a feeble cry to Joss, and fainted
away in a limp, demoralised heap into a bin full
of nee. The story goes on to say that he was
found the next morning dead . jut that is pro-
bably a lie.

When the first Congregational Church was
opened at Ipswich, in 1854, a sermon was preached
by the Rev. Dr. Nelson, father of the Minister for
Railways in the Morehead Ministry and present
member for Northern Downs. Among the clergy-
men present was one tall man aoopmpamed by a
little boy nine years of age, who took juvenile
notes of Dr. Nelson’s sermon. That little boy is

une the well and favourably known
squatters of Western Queensland Was Robertson,
of Mount Abundance, a station on Bungeworgorai
Creek, where a new-chum died of lockjaw repeat-
mg the name of the locality. Many years ago the
station was visited by old P. O’Sullivan, in his
capacity as a “travelling merchant.” Paddy was
one of the members of the first Queensland Parlia-
merit in 1861, and the old warrior still occupies an
honoured seat in the Legislature. On nearing
Mount Abundance he decided to camp on the flat
along the creek, and forthwith proceeded to un-
harness his team. Two men came down to say
that Robertson wouldn’t allow anyone to camp
there, as the last sojourners in that locality “ had
stolen some sheep!” Paddy was, of course,
charmed with the graceful compliment conveyed
m the imputation that he was round there on a
sheep-stealing expedition. He replied as follows :
“Take this trace-chain and chain up Robertson
to the sheep-yard, where he can bark all night and
scare away sheep-steafers !” He also added a few
supplementary remarks that gave the message
additional tone and vigour. The result of this
preliminary strained relationship was a summons
to p. O’S. to appear at the Court in Roma. On
the day of the case, Robertson appeared in town,
anc j was on the look-out for the Hibernian brigand
w ho had defied the Caledonian lion in his own
lair. He was also on the look-out for the lawyer
he had engaged to conduct the prosecution. As
it happened, there were only two lawyers in town,
and Paddy had interviewed them both that morn-
ing a t their hotel. The result was that Robertson
me t him coming up the main street with one of
these legal stars leaning on each arm, sufficiently
“screwed” not to know a court-house from a
church, or “Addison on Contracts” from the
“ Arabian Nights.” The smile on Paddy’s classic
f ace was one the spectators remember to this day.
Robertson realised the situation at a glance. The
case was withdrawn—costs allowed defendant,
The Rampant Lion banner struck to the Green
Harp; each found the other to be a foeman worthy
G f fils best regard, and by the poetic stream of
Bungeworgorai, Caledonia and Hibernia cele-
brated peace in some of the best whisky in Aus-
tralia.

Tom Buckland is a well-known man on
Charters Towers. Some years ago Tom was on
his way up t | lere from Townsville. There was no
ra q wa y j n those days, and accommodation was of
the usual primitive type. Tom stopped to dine at
a ru m-selling caravansary on Ross River, about
four m q es ou t 0 f Townsville, on the site of the
present suburb of Mundingburra. On the table
was a round of half-raw beef, carved by a dirty
ruffian who wiped his sore eyes with the same
towel with which he polished_ the table tumblers,
and who looked as if he had lived since boyhood in
a country destitute of water and soap. He cut
the beef in hideous chunks, and called out “Hey,
there !” as he heaved each fragment across the
table to an astonished guest. Just before the con-
clusion of this sumptuous repast, a meek-looking
man came into the room and said : “ I hope you
coves won’t go away until that poor young chap is
buried!” “ What young chap?” “ That young
fellow lying out there in the kitchen?” “In the
kitchen?” “Yes; he died yesterday, and has
been laid out in the kitchen ever since !” Holy
Mahomet! The banqueters rose as one man, and
went out to the kitchen to see if this was not some
ghastly joke. There was no joke about it.
Stretched on a form, close to the fireplace where
all the dinner had been cooked, w as the corpse
of a man in the first stage of decomposition,
partly covered by kitchen towels that had probably
been temporarily removed to wipe the dinner-
plates ! Then came thoughts of the half-raw beef,
the disreputable carver, the tablecloth that looked
as if it had been used to swab out a hen-roost,
and the dog-eating Chinaman acting as cook and
caretaker of the corpse ! And Tom Buckland and
several others went out in the fresh air.
MAROOGALINE.
To Constitutional Leaders.
(BY AN UNATTACHED UNIONIST.)
O men of talents exceedingly small,
What is your use in the van at all ?
Your deeds are dark and your speech is dumb
Of the dawning day that is all-but come.
You march in the front with the old-time stare
And the old-time language of menace and prayer ;
But the mass in the rear no more relies
For light on the sight of your staring eyes ;
The mass in the rear no more is cowed
By threats of the fate of a turbulent crowd;
The mass in the rear no more forbears
When you load the air with pleading prayers.
The corner-stones of your laws are dust,
For their right was wrong and their just unjust;
And the mass in the rear have but to blow
When your House of Law to the winds must go.
In the brutish times the strongest beasts
Led the idlest lives, ate the richest feasts ;
They made the weak of mind and limb
To respond through life to their every whim.
And if one or two at times demurred
They were gyved and lashed at the strong brute’s
word;
And it two or three at times showed fight
They were gyved and hanged in the strong brute’s
sight.
Your House of Law was based on these
Violent vices and infamies ;
And the thrones in its gilded halls were filled
By the lineal heirs of the brutes that killed ;
And ci’owded lobbies of jackals cried
That these lineal heirs were the sanctified —
Were the Powers That Be, the rulers given
To establish right as it is in heaven.
The ruffians that plundered and murdered to
thrones,
The jackals named most holy ones;
And the mass was ordered to bow its head
To whatever the diademed ruffians said.
• • • • • • •
And tears and blood dripped on and on,
And the father’s cause fell to the son ;
And ever and always courage remained
To challenge the claims of those who reigned.
Through your House of Law the tears and blood
Soaked down to the ground on which it stood
Tnl the corner-stones have rolled away
And left your House a toy to-day.
• • • • • •
O men of talents exceedingly small,
Why march you there in the van at all ?
Your office of use is dead and gone,
For the mass but waits the breaking dawn.
Better retire from your idle posts
Before the hour when the victor hosts,
Beholding the sun in the east, will cry
That the brutes and their lineage all must die,
And the fruits of their ancient rapine be
Weighed in new scales of Equity.

So Much for Conspiracy.
Thus the Melbourne Argus
Any combination to hinder and harass a squatter in tin)
pursuit of his lawful occupation comes well within the
definitions of the common law relating to conspiracy.
Suppose that it does. It does so, only because
“ any combination to hinder and harass anyone in
the pursuit of his lawful occupation ” comes well
within such definitions. ~Eryo— and we merely
repeat what we have stated over and over again—
any employers who combine against employes,
any conspirators who boom alleged “good things ”
on ’Change, any “ cornerers ” of any market—aye,
any non-unionists who combine to lower the
current wages paid to recognised tradesmen, any
set of ladies who unite to import domestic servants
from England, to the detriment of honest girls
hbre seeking to follow their lawful occupations,
tlhd almost anybody who does anything that
trenches on anybody else’s doings in this curious
bivillsatiop, composed of a lot of struggling and
fighting atoms —all these can surely he brought,
Somehow or other, itilder this Wonderful, this rotten,
iltld absiitd law Of conspiracy. Find the bedrock of
it, and our Whole System Of CoVerllmeiifc is otic
Vast conspiracy. Caucuses are undoubted con-
spiracies. Flections ate brazen arid vile con-
spiracies. Biased newspapers Which gammon
to represent public opinion are the hugest of
bouspiracies. Monopolies ate the wickedest of
bonspirrioies against the rights and liberties of the
inasses; Theoretically, the lari' of conspiracy is
& sivord that crits eVety Way., It
is oiily pecause the law is itself , a cunning
conspiracy wllicH enables .money to , triumph
rigairist poverty -that this sword cuts too often
u lint orie direction, When tjie people v slialJ

Ownership of hqid, is .a, brutal tyranny against

When we once venture into abstract theory, of
which the Conservative press seems so fond just
now, the arguments are all on our side. When
we travel outside abstractions, wo can oppose
moral forces to overwhelm the moral forces used
ou behalf of the classes against the masses, and,
in the final appeal, physical forces when they dare
to call to their assistance the anjurnentum ad
bacuiinum— the bayonet and the baton. We
prefer to move while we can within the moral
compass only, but Mr. Champion spoke only a
truth, the alternative half of which seems not to
have received the attention it merited, when he
said that each member of a democracy was bound
to observe the laws which he had assisted to
frame, 01 —and there’s a deal in this or—
or proclaim himself straight out a rebel. At
this point enters the consideration of expediency,
of power, of ability to succeed. A successful
revolution vindicates itself. The strong to win
and to hold make the law. It is no use denying it.
Our Whole system is an illustration of it. The
descendants of the robbers of the past, by the
mere accident of birth, are the legal kings and
saints of to-day They have been Powerful and
wicked enough to hold what their ancestors were
powerful and wicked enough to steal. The few
privileges owned by the masses are only such as
the classes have been weak enough to permit,
Sorely against their will, to be wrested from them.
The “ mostly'fools ” make but slow and troubled
advances towards, their ultimate goal, but each
spasm;—whether it.be orie. of concerted Wisdom,,
one of mixed follies, or one of blind fury—is an
advance towards liberty. “ The
round whom the Argus rallies, form but a puny
item among a dozen or two fierce classes of oppres-
sors. We need not stop to enquire as to the
nature of their so-called “lawful occupation.’'
Increasing population that must live, and not
merely exist, will settle that point in due course,
together with the other conspiracies of rent,
“rings,” class laws and plural voting—the last,
the crowning offence of triumphant oppression
and the mammon godhead.
Writes George Moore : —“ The French,
who. notwithstanding what is thought to the con-
trary by the narrow-minded inhabitants of these
islands, cherish and respect their homes, have de-
cided that their divorce-cases shall be tried in
camera. It will hot be suggested they have done
sd because their divorce-cases are filthier than
ours—it will be admitted that that is rtot possible
—they haVe done so because they know that dirty
linen is better Washed at hotne. Surely this is
the better Way, ahd in the name of the ordinary
and the necessary decencies of life, I ask that it
shall be considered; I ask help from all. Let
questions, concerning the propriety of pictorial
advertisement* and ulusic-ball songs be forgiven
fbr a hlomfent; let its put asidri ditr many differ-
ences of opinion arid together stride to combat all
eVU Which is an etili Our newspaper-reports arfe
a, disgfacq td civilisation, tile scttildal has reached
its Height, arid calls for refotm. The O’Sheri
divorce is coming on in a few months’ time;
oiie of,, the witnesses ; will bp trip petitioner’s
son, who, it , is. said,' . will , give, evidence
agaipst . his . mother. Now, I risk if jt is
Christian* if it is,decent, if it is tolerable that tips

lent gossip of the town?,, Surely, it is not right
that, sucli a thing should be! , Bettel; that divorces
should be .abolished. B.ettep that we, should, go
pack; .to tjie pßoman.law, vGuch,granted,’ upon
application, divprce to either party, stipulating
only that the person div, reed, if divorced without
just cause, should be properly indemnified. How
the end is reached I cai - e not so long as it is
reached. I want to prevent the publication of
these infamous reports, but whether this is done
by the simple abolition of divorce, or by the
establishment of divorce according to Roman law,
or by the mere decision that henceforth divorce-
cases shall be heard in camera, I care hardly a jot;
so important, so essential do I deem the suppres-
sion of these reports that all other considerations
are outweighed by this one desire. I pray that
this may be done soon, for Divorce .Court filth is
fast becoming the habitual colour of the Londoner’s!
mind.”
“Mona Caird,” remarks a recent writer,
“believes in marriage by private contract. She
thinks that people should be allowed. Under
gradually lessening restrictions, to make their own
marriage bargain, and she believes that they,
would stick to bargains that tiiey chaffered over
for themselves-a good deal more successfully than
to such as they pick up ready-made. It seems
that Mona Oaird’s marriages would be partner-
ships terminable according to the conditions of
tlie contract, at proper intervals, or by mutual
consent at any time, as other partnerships are.
The objections to such a plan are manifold-rat her
more manifold, we think, than the objections to
marriage as it is—which is saying a good deal, of
course. For one thing, making the best of A
marriage is & forni of -disoiplirie that is dtibh of thjh
Highest th’ thfe Character; but fett p'eofuC
would .be at id IniproVe thbfnsefveS iff
just that way if marriage should th. bfe df eti
theoretically permanent. Hut, perhaps, the most
striking objection to Mona Qaird’s plan is that it
would so complicate courtship. At present the
custom is to get married first, and settle the condi-
tions after the fact. No man and woman dis-
cusses like sane beings how much they will
marry. Such a discussion would only be pos-
sible to two sophisticated humans endowed, both
of them, with such an active sense of humour as
would certainly keep them from becoming more
than friends. When there is marrying to be done
somebody has got to be in the deadest earnest
about it. Marriage may result when both parties
are in dead earnest, or where one is in earnest and
one acquiescent, or where the friends or relatives
are in earnest and both the parties are acquiescent.
But it may be doubted if people in suffioent com-
mand of their wits and their sense of humour to
discuss comfortably whether they had better marry
at all, and if so for how long and to what extent,
are in a state desperate enough to warrant their
entering the marriage state at all. Courtship, as
at present conducted, is as though the man who
had gained by persuasive arts a measure of the
Woman’s confidence, led her out to the end of
a pier. The water is deep-blue, and you can’t
see the bottom. He invites her to jump in with
him, and it depends ripon the degree of satisfac-
tion she finds iri his company, and her opinion
of his ability to fetch her ashore whether she com-
plies. Mona Caird would have her say: I will
not jdnip off here where it is over my head, but if
you will come nearer the shore, where the water
is not above my knees, perhaps I may jump off
with you there r then if we don’t like it we can
Wade ashote, ,Biit then tHe man would say ; No !
wading is pot swimming; THetfe ate plerity, of
girls who are willing to lie sisters, td me, hilt what
lam after is a wife, Everybody, kndfrs—every-
body, that is, except Mona Caird—that Woman
is not a good hand at ah ante nuptial bargain.
When oboe she makes rip her. mind to jump off the
dock -,with her man-, she, doesn’t care to take
soundings. It ip sink or swim, then, and the
deeper the better. Marriage is the, bargain the
law makes for her. It may be a faulty one, but it
is incalculably better than she would make it if
left to herself. Perhaps she may grow warier as
the icons accumulate. Who can tell ? ”
We have before us the full list of the
cardinals, from amid whom the next Pope must
be picked, but it is like trying to tip the Melbourne
Gup winner ovlt of the entries. There are 63
cardinals at present, ranking as six cardinal
bishops, 44 cardinal priests and 13 cardinal dea-
cons. The cardinal deacons are La Valetta,
Btefano, Parocchi, Bianclii, Serafini and Howard,
and the three first have a chance, being respec-
tively Lean of the Sacred College, Oamerlengo (or
Chamberlain) and Vicar-General. Among the
cardinal priests, conspicuous men are Hohenlohc
(■German), Lucien Bonaparte (Italian), Manning
(English), L c dochowski (Polish), Navarrete
(Spanish), Lavigerie (French), Moran (Italian we
presume), Acquarella (Italian), Taschereau (Cana-
dian), Gipbons (American). Newman was only a
cardinal deacon.

Gas is produced at a certain Melbourne

however, are continually disappearing, likewise
the pillows, not forgetting the mattrasses, and so

It is an open secret that General Downes
(S.A.) could not rely on the Adelaide Volunteers
in case of trouble with the strikers; Consequently
the country troops—consisting of farmers and

There is no such thing as capital punish-
ment at all in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Hol-

are hanged, but mere vulgar murderers are not;
Belgium executes in theory, but never ih practice,
and the same is the case in Italy (the guillotine
being the theoretical instrument), except in Tus-
cany, where the old law of the Grand Dukes
abolishing capital punishment still prevails.

A flavour or bouquet of fine, old, crusted
Christianity pervades Orange Lodge No. 68, which
infests the city of Ballarat (Vic.). Among the
recent fads of the Victorian Government is a
series of grants to debating societies throughout
the colony, and among others an organisation at
Ballarat was voted the sum of £5O. At the last
moment,, however, the grant was withheld on
account of the strictly sectarian and Orange
character of the society. No offensive Papist was
eligible fot admission, and the society held itself
strictly aloof from the Unclean Thing which
believes ih saints and transubstantiation, and
declines to holler for the lamented William in his
sepulchre. But even William was not worth the
loss of £5O, and as no Orangeman offered to make
up the diffetehce for the sake of his faith, the
members threw the immortal Dutchman over-
board and took the money. Then Orange Lodge
No. 68 awoke from its slumbers and indicted
those of its followers who had voted for the spiri-
tual leprosy and hooked the coin of the Amale-
kites on a charge of assisting the “encroachments
of the Papacy.” The fact that any intelligent
Catholic is allowed to argue about the strike, and
the reasons why Wellington wasn’t licked at
Waterloo, and the literary hiddenness of Brown-
ing, is, in the opinion of Lodge 68, another blow
at the true faith, as well as a short cut to idolatry
and the Inquisition. And accordingly the back-
sliders were visited by the Greater Excommuni-
cation and the Smaller Excommunication, and all
manner of intermediate anathemas, and when
they hinted in rep y that Lodge No. 68 was an
idiotic bigot and ought to bray and live on thistles,
the burning fervour of William blazed up in
frenzy and they were cast out into the street.

Roundabout.
A Bathurst (N.S.W.) paper publishes a
thrilling article on the question: “Why do men
die ?” The answer seems easy, and yet, on careful
consideration, it proves to be a good deal less easy
than might be supposed. A good many of them,
probably, are talked to death, and some go reck-
lessly to law, and are scared to death by the bill.
A few get frozen sleeping in the hen-house to keep
out of the way of their mothers-in-law, and here
and there some reckless individual calls a big man
a liar and goes to his great reward inconsequence.
Now and then a harmless but stupid citizen gets
his health proposed at a banquet, and dies of sur-
prise at hearing of his own good qualities ; or he
snuffs his life away by Yarra’s smellful banks, or
else a stentorian Salvation trombonist comes and
performs before his door, and he departs to lie
low on the weather bow in a visionary vale, where
the amaranth grows and the rose of Sharon hangs
out for evermore. < r possibly he gets married
and perishes through the fading of a great illusion,
when he sees his idol rush round on a cold morning
in a petticoat and one boot and a shoe, and
with a large hole in her stocking, and her
hair in curl-papers, and a dish-cloth hur-
riedlv tied round her neck, and an inflamma-
tory light on the extreme end of her nose ; or he
may be killed off by her top-note when she sits
down and flogs the vociferous piano in the gloam-
ing; or again he may back a bill for his father-in-
law, and then breathe his last when it falls due
and neither of them can raise the money to meet ;
it. These are all rapid and joyless methods of
extinction, but a gradual and mirthful end can be
arrived at by having some money left to you, and
then going on an hospitable drunk for six weeks,
and finishing up on gruel in the Benevolent
Asylum, and being walked on by an attendant in
heavy boots, after which the doctor states that
death has arisen from something extensive in a
foreign language. The above are a few of the
reasons why men die, and the person who is proof
against them all can solve the great problem by
starting a curiosity paper in a locality where he is
expected to drink out the advertisements ; or else
he may shuffle off his mortal coil by attempting to
deliver a time-payment volume in the back-blocks
where an enraged population has resolved not to
pay and is defending its position with a gun
# * *
A vague, uncertain rumour of another
happy home burst-up pervades the air of an
eastern suburb. The information at present avail-
able is scanty, but judging from some things
which were heard indistinctly through the dark-
ness on a wet night, it is generally understood that
matters have gone wrong. The lady was barely
twenty-five, and her lawful owner was a tough
old crank of sixty-two, who looked like a bird of
prey in a huge shirt-collar. He was in the soft-
goods business and seldom tore himself away from
the office till a late hour. But one night recently
he was seen eloping steeply homeward through a
torrent of rain about 7 p.m., and it has been since
declared as a fact likely to be supported by good
corroborative testimony that as his dry bones
rattled and clanked up to the front door strange
skurrying noises were heard in an upper room,
and a figure was seen trying to escape over a
balcony. Then there was a wild shuffling of feet,
a woman’s voice heard amid the gloom in tones of
grief and expostulation, and a sketchy outline was
observed standing in a puddle, and shaking a fist'
that looked like half a spectral ham at the indi-
vidual above, and a female flew distractedly up
and down the verandah, and tore her hair, and
asked what was to become of her. And finally as
the unbidden guest tried to clamber on to the
roof it appeared that something gave way, and he
came clawing and scrambling and struggling to
the ground : and there were thuds and concussions
on the lawn, and the air was filled with bangs and
clatter and sounds like tons of clay falling about,
and presently a procession of two streamed away
in the darkness, and flitted restlessly over the back
fence into the obscurity beyond. Also it is reported
that a Christian gentleman of irreproachable
character looks as if he had been pursued down-
stairs by an iron-safe and it had overtaken him
successfully at the end of the excursion ; and a
lady who used to shine in society arrived unex-
pectedly at her mother’s house about the hour of
ten, hatless and in hysterics, and with one boot
lost in the mud, and an eminent business man is
lame in one eye and suffers an attack of rheu-
matism through staying out in the rain to commit
a violent assault on some person or persons un-
known.

The average western town is of an in-
flammable order. It is built chiefly of old boards,
kerosene tins, grass, bark, and all manner of com-
bustible wreckage, and is liable to blaze
spontaneously at the shortest notice. Therefore,
whenever a light appears on the horizon, the fire-
brigade—when there is one—gets its old, dis-
mantled turret ready for action, and harnesses up
the goat with a clothes-line, and makes sure that
the water-jug is filled and the squirt in working
order, and starts at full tear for the scene of.
action. One night not long ago the people of a
town out on the plains were roused by the incen-
diary clang of the alarm-bell, and looking forth
they saw a red glare far away on the sky-line. It
looked as if the whole globe had commenced to
flare up, and the firemen felt that a great under-
taking was in front of them. Their own horse
was (lead, but they impounded the animal that
propelled the local dirt-cart, and hitched it to the
engine before it was awake. The tailor seized on
a helmet which concealed everything but his legs,
and grasped the reins, and the butcher hung on
behind with another helmet that barely covered
one ear. Some of the brigade was in its night-
robe, and some of it was attired in a dishcloth
and a belltopper, and the captain had hardly
anything at all except a false tooth and a boot,
but the claims of duty were above all other con-
siderations, so they woke up the horse and started.
The glare on the horizon was growing larger
every moment, and wider, and redder, and the
brigade realised the urgency of the danger, and
took a bee-line over everything. The old horse
out of the dirt-cart seemed to be endowed with
human intelligence, and he flew through the
gloom like a spectral horse flying upon the wings
of the morning over a land of dreams. He tore
down the first slope at a reckless gallop, with a dog
after him, and then he ploughed with his immense
feet through a hedge, and scraped off two of the
company, and he negotiated the rise beyond
and fell at the top, and kicked half the
machine to splinters in getting up again,
and when he got up crashed along for the next
mile on three legs, for he was trying to scrape a
clod off his ear with the other one. He hitched
the off hind wheel in a fence and carried it along
in his mad career, but presently the butcher
knocked off the encumbrance with an axe : and
then he found a long stretch of level ground be-
fore him and pounded along with the vigour of a
horse that meant to gallop through all eternity.
Eight miles had been covered and the fire was still
ahead, and about the middle of the ninth mile the
whole machine got wrecked against a tree, and the
horse went on alone. The chief of the brigade
was fired up among the branches With his hair
full of twigs and dead leaves and bark, and the
test of the party were mostly impaled on different
parts of the fence. They disentangled themselves
slowly and with a lot of copious profanity, and
held a meeting, partly on the fence and partly in
the ditch, and resolved that even though the
engine was a pile of dislocated iron by the road-
side, and its motive power was galloping for the
distant Pacific, their honour required that they
should reach the conflagration or perish. But
just at this moment the butcher burst into choice
execration, and cursed the fire and the fire brigade,
and every separate and individual member thereof,
together with his father and his mother and his
grand-uncle and his wife’s sec nd cousin twice
removed, and his aunt in the country, and all his
collateral relations, and their relations as well, and
he cursed the town and the surrounding district,
find said that their officer was a Chinaman and the
father of a hog. And thenhechoked and stuttered
with rage, but as he pointed to the east the rest of
the party looked across the plain, and realised
that they had been galloping like a crowd of furies
to extinguish the rising moon.

The afflicted town of Rockhampton (Q.)
has been stood up violently oil its end by a visit
from that great man. Admiral Lord Charles Scott.
This is his short or abbreviated name, but when
he is expressed in his largest and widest signifi-
cance there is a lot more of him. The Admiral
expressed himself as greatly pleased with the
town, and then he broke up and escaped in dis-
order. He took a hurried glance at the gaol, and
the grey, clammy river, and the hospital, and the
meat works, and he was taken round to a place
where there was a copious deposit of old effluvium,
and to another place which smelt as if a horse had
been plunging about on a lot of ancient eggs and
old, decayed fat, and an accumulation of aged
bones was exhibited to him, and then, as already
mentioned, he burst away and got back to his
ship. Consequently he did not see the full
beauties of Rockhampton. To do that it is best
to go forth on a summer evening, and embark in a
canoe just about that spot where the shark ends
and the alligator begins, and steal away in the
dusk up the damp and murky river. And as the
miles of solemn water flit away behind the lost
canoeist he comes to long reaches of silent wood-
land, and at some romantic spot he can land
in seven feet of mud, and rouse up the father
of all odours as he wades through the festering
alluvial deposit to the shore. Then the best
thing to do is to kindle a fire and hold a
midnight picnic and fish. As a rule, you build
the fire by accident on top of some loathly worm
two feet long, and yott hear the animal holler and
boil and burst amid the flames. A Iso, it is
customary to sit down on the sleeping snake or
the great tarantula, and as you muse on the loveli-
ness a cockroach df immense diameter domes out
atld stamps oh you, and grits his teeth viciously.
There are 1000 thousand mosquitoes in every cttbic
inch of atmosphere, and nobody ever catches
anything except one catfish ; and Wheli a passing
alligator drops in it is t me to plunge through the
mud and re-embark; If the lost fisherman gets
back to town by midnight he Will be gratified to
find that some refreshment is still obtainable at a
late restaurant kept by a Chinaman. He is a
slippery Mongol with uncertain legs, ahd he
generally does a somersault oh the greasy floor
and arrives in a sitting posture oli top of the
victuals, and their he rises up with a smile and
states that it is “alien li.” The full, elaborate
loveliness of Rockhampton Can only be appreciated
after prolonged study and Contemplation, but
unhappily the Admiral tore himself away prema-
turely before the scenery had time td soak into his
souh
All affectionate boarder was brought tip
before a Melbourne magistrate last week and fined
60s. for a wild, romantic passion in a hash-house.
He was a coarse, ordinary boarder, with no lofty
sentiment or nobility of soul, but the landlady
Was young and fair and too beautiful for earth,
and lie longed to win her love and start a home of
his own where she could wash the floors for him,
and shine his boots, and make herself otherwise
Useful. And at last early one morning, while the
lady was in the bath-room and standing pensively
under the shower, she heard him pouring out his
tale of devotion through the keyhole. She clutched
the tap hysterically for support and bade him
depart, but he only wailed sorrowfully at the
orifice. Then she hesitated whether to dive into
the uttermost depths of the bath and conceal her-
self by making a lather in the water, or whether
to leap out and hang on desperately to the door,
but while she was thinking he became so urgent
in his entreaties that she decided on the latter
course. She braced her head and her two hands
against the panel and planted both feet against
the opposite wall and told him that she could
never reciprocate his passion- Then he shed
tears through the keyhole and begged for some
token of remembrance, if it were only one kiss —
one little kith—and the lady tried to get into her
dressing-gown with one hand and put on her boots
with the other, and hold the door with her head
and one foot all at the same moment, while she
urged him to woo another bride fOt she could
