"THE BULLETIN,”
(Published at SYDNEY, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia’s Nonparell
Illustrated Newspaper.
“The Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
h the only paper which has a consistent and dis-
tinctive Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
One Person, one Vote.
Complete Secularisation and Freedom of State
Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
Australia for the Australians.—The cheap
Clijnaman, the cheap nigger, and the
cheap European pauper to be absolutely
excluded.
A State Bank, the issue of bank-notes to be a
State monopoly.
The direct election of Ministers by Parlia-
ment, instead of Party Government or
rather Government by Contradiction.
A new Parliamentary System one House to
be elected by constituencies as at present;
the other to be chosen by the whole
country voting as one Constituency.
A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance.
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-
ship of Land.
The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “nobility. ’
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter that is nob
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started 13 years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become the representative Australian
journal, because it possesses a vitality lacked
by the countless newspaper-ventures in which
Australian capitalists have unavailingly spent
large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after th
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form —printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress: it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the cla : ms of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has nob been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and xnost
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

OF THE CON VTCT SYSTEM-
Dear Bulletin :—Your correspondent
“Squint ” states, in your issue of June 30, that
“ woman is a curvilinear, man areotilinear animal.”
“Squint” will probably write next to mention that
man has naturally got three legs. If he can find
even one straight line in the outline of the average
man. I will marry his grandmother. Evidently
“Squint” doesn’t wash often enough to know
how he looks with his clothes off. —Yours, &0.,
T.S.
Oolemane & Sons’ Vie. Ointment is marvellous.
Smith was a new-chum and green, but all
the same he got a billet as boundary-rider. As dogs
had been worrying the sheep on the back run, the
boss handed Smith a butcher’s-knife and a bottle
of strychnine, saying “go and poison half-a-dozen
sheep out there and see what that will do.” When
the boundary-rider returned, says the boss.; “Well,
Smith, did you poison those sheep;” '“Yes,”
replied the new-chum, rather excitedly, “and a
nice job I had getting some of the brutes to take
it.” The boss now does his own poisoning.
Oolemane & Sons’ Eucalypte Pills stir one up.
Steinberger, once a notable figure in
Samoan politics, died in Boston, U.S.A., on
May 3. He was an old comrade and trusted
friend of Grant, and when he arrived in Apia in
’73 in his yacht Peerless, ostensibly merely to
“ report on the condition of affairs ” there, he
brought with him a large sum of money to
further the design of annexation held by the
“Samoan party” in Congress, of which Grant
himself was the working but silent leader. Sub-
sequently, however, a majority-vote of Congress
disapproved of American interference and repudi-
ated Steinberger, but Grant stuck loyally to his
friend and sent further supplies of money; and
then Steinberger played a lone hand, and by mere
force of his personal individuality succeeded in
forming a Government of which he was the
mainspring and working head. A born soldier
and adventurer, as well as a fair administrator, he
soon won the sympathy and support of a
large section of the fickle native popula-
tion who were attracted to him by his
personal courage, eloquent tongue, and open-
handed liberality. But the white people of the
group were his bitter enemies. The planters,
merchants, and traders—German, English, and
American —did not want a man like Steinberger
at the head of affairs. He was a mercenary ad-
venturer, they said, and when he tried to establish
customs-duties they foresaw the end of their reign
of extortionate plunder and robbery of the natives.
They did not want a first-robber. As a brother-
robber he would have been tolerated. Common
cause was made. The English trader, hating the
Yankee trader, swore friendship with the German
trader who detested them both, and a strong and
bitter coalition of commercial greed and rapine
was formed against him. Two of the three Consuls
were the puppets and mouthpieces of the
party, and every power of intrigue, slander,
and misrepresentation was used to weaken and
corrupt his influence with the natives. At fono,
when the little, dark-faced man rose to speak, the
natives listened eagerly to his quick, burning words.
And he believed in the future he painted for
them. He did not want to be the Shirley Baker
of Samoa. Nor did he come there to steal their
money and their land and their liberties. But he
would make a nation of them and train them to
fight against and cast out the papalagi robbers
who were eating up their land day by day. He
displayed the sword that, when with Grant, he had
carried on many a bloody field in the Rebellion
and told them that that was his token of friend-
ship to their cause—Samoa for the Samoans. His
scathing, contemptuous invective of the Germans
—“They who steal your land by forged and lying
words written on the skins of mamce (sheep)of
the British Consul—“ That timorous lo matua
(old woman) who seeks to terrify you with silly
talk about the great power of another old woman
in England”—all helped to further his scheme and
increase the animosity of his white antagonists.
Once, at a big fono on Savaii, a chief —a creature
of the Consuls —rose and said that Samoa was
ever “a land sought out by moneyless wanderers.”
Eor answer Steinberger took a handful of gold and
flung it contemptuously out among the cocoanuts.
But the hidden forces arrayed against him proved
too strong; and Steinberger succumbed, defiant to
the last. The last act was played at a great fpno
held on Mulin’u Point in 1876. The captain of
an English man-of-war, the Barracouta, with an
alleged guard of honour, landed to attend the
meeting. A shot was fired, some say accidentally,
and then a scene of slaughter ensued between
bluejackets and marines and natives, Steinberger
was seized and deported to Fiji, and the one
chance of a free Samoa vanished with the smoke
of the rifles on Mulin’u Point.

SATURDAY, JULY 14, 1894.
The New South Wales General Election.
It is popularly assumed that every paper and
every person in any community under Par-
liamentary Government must be a supporter
of one or other of the recognised political
parties. The whole policy of Government
by Contradiction is built upon this assump-
tion, and Maoriland, in particular, so firmly
recognises the theory, that the elector who
doesn’t vote for one of the existing parties
is disfranchised, for the law takes no account
of the fact that a rational citizen may
find all parties about equally objection-
able. In New South Wales the State
doesn’t carry the popular idea to
the same logical conclusion, but it clings
to the theory none the less. It formally
recognises only two Parliamentary elements
—the Government and the Opposition ; and
it thereby assumes that the man who isn’t
satisfied with Dibbs must approve with his
whole soul of Reid, and the man who isn t
satisfied with Reid must find his highest
ideal in Dibbs. The possibility that any
elector who is clothed and in his right mind
may find a void in his political soul which
Dibbs and Reid are unable to satisfy, and
which can’t even be adequately filled by
Cook, or by Holman, the fluent young
man who leads the rival section of the
Labour-party and seeks to “down” Cook
and his party, lies altogether beyond the
philosophy of Party Government.
* • *
So far as concerns the three parties, which
practically make up the sum total of New
South Wales politics, The Bulletin’s posi-
tion is practically that it has no definite posi-
tion at all. The paper that supports men
always comes to grief, sooner or later, when
the men go astray after strange gods, as,
sooner or later, they always do ; and the
paper that supports parties—which are only
aggregations of men—invariably meets with
a similar experience. The one thing which
is certain about political parties is that they
are all about equally uncertain. In New
South Wales the Ministerial party consists
practically of Dibbs, and the reasons why
The Bulletin doesn’t support that poli-
tician are many. The Protectionist Govern-
ment, under his leadership, has made its
leading principle a mockery by establishing
a mongrel revenue-tariff which is not Pro-
tection in any reasonable sense, and which,
by assuming the name, brings the principle
into contempt. His alleged republicanism
has gone by the board with his accept-
ance of a cheap and tawdry decoration.
His alleged democratic principles went to
wreck when he declared against payment
of members, and when his Government
strained the forms of law and justice to sup-
press the Broken Hill strikers in their pro-
test against a shameless breach of faith, and
to help the mine-owners of the Barrier to
break their solemn covenant with their em-
ployes. Dibbs’ banking legislation was par-
tially excusable so far as it went, inasmuch
as it was necessary to make a choice in haste
between two evils, but when he took extra-
ordinary measures to save the shady bank
directors of the province, without providing
any safeguards for depositors and share-
holders in the shape of State supervision, he
constituted himself bully and chucker-out for
the Fat Men of New South Wales. And
as the Draconian Dibbs’ party made no
effectual protest against any of these things,
it and its leader are equally responsible.
* # #
The Dibbs Government has apparently no
intention of imposing a land-tax, nor does it
seem to be especially sincere concerning.
Federation, Local Government, or any other
great question. It lent a hand to the Colo
Valley job, and many other similar “ private
enterprises.” Its Minister for Works, Lyne,
is the apostle of shindykits and private
enterprise in general. And every one of its
members are on the list of candidates which
the National Ass urges its party to sup-
port through thick and thin, which fact alone
should be sufficient to utterly damn its
chances with the great bulk of the people.
The politician can be known by the kind of
men who approve of him, and the fact that
the National Ass cordially approves of the
Dibbs Ministry is equal to whole volumes of
execration.
• • «
The Reid party presents all the worst
features of the Dibbs party, and some of its
own in addition. It has approved cordially
of every hopelessly bad action of the Ministry
all through its career. It endorsed to the
uttermost the disgraceful conduct of the
Government during the Broken Hill diffi-
culty ; it helped along its banking legislation
and its various “private enterprises,” and
its leader is an even more cordial opponent
of payment of members than Premier Dibbs
himself. The followers of lawyer Reid have
been associated with almost every gross
extravagance perpetrated during the last
thirty years of the province’s history. The
party in general has lived on exciting sec-
tarian animosities, and it has been angling
of late for the votes of the Single-tax party
by roundabout promises to levy an almost
confiscatory impost on landholders. Now
that the election is at hand, however, it is
backing down from this rashly-assumed
position, and its promised land-tax is evi-
dently on a par with the other land-tax
whichPARKES and Treasurer Burns promised
so enthusiastically some six or seven years
ago. The party preaches Freetrade, yet
promises to raise £2,000,000 annually in
Customs duties, so that it is even an
apostate to its own miserable faith. It has
done nothing at all for Federation, or Local
Government, or Republicanism, or Land
Nationalisation, or any other Democratic
principle ; it is par excellence the party of
the Fat Man and the big landholder,
of the plutocrat, the shoddy importer,
and all these classes which neither toil nor
spin nor do anything whatever for the
good of the community. Also, it is worse
than the Government party, inasmuch as it
is opposed even to the scanty measure of
Protection which the present Ministry has
granted ; its one great and unpatriotic
yearning is to establish a Government of
importers which will wipe out native indus-
try in the interests of the import trade ; it
has not one-tenth the collective brain even
of the Dibbs Cabinet ; it is permeated with
the Parkes leprosy in its worst form ; and
its leaders, like Dibbs and all his colleagues,
are on the National Ass secret-circular list
of approved candidates, which is, in itself, a
sufficient evidence of their worthlessness.
# # #
These are a few of The Bulletin’s reasons
why it can support neither the Government
nor the direct Opposition. The reasons why
it docs not swallow the Labour-party whole
are equally explicit. That party appears to
have sold itself almost entirely to the Foreign-
trade interest, and the curse of Foreign-
trade weighs upon New South Wales almost
as heavily as the curse of landlordism
and National Ass politics. It is travel-
ling more and more upon the assumption
thatno one can beaDemocrat unless his hands
are largo and horny with manual toil, and
is approaching more and more to the ideal of
a Ministry of trades-union officials. It bitterly
opposes even good and reliable Democrats
unless they will take its cast-iron pledge and
subject themselves wholly to the domination
of the Labour Electoral League’s Central
Committee, a disinterested body whose
chiefest aim obviously is to get itself and its
brother Bill into Parliament. It is doing its
utmost to crush the best and most intellectual
men of its own party in Parliament because
they lack the needful subserviency, and to
replace them—mostly by men, so far as
the world knows, of far inferior mental
calibre. Moreover, it seems content to
remain a Labour-party, instead of becoming,
as it should be, a Democratic party with a
comprehensive national programme. On
questions which affect, not merely its own
constituency, but the community as a whole,
it seems as indifferent as either the Govern-
ment or the Opposition. It is growing
narrower instead of growing broader, and
its reputation for patriotism is vanishing
among the scrambles for Parliamentary
billets of its cheap debating-society orators.
# * •
The Bulletin believes thoroughly in the
alleged land-tax policy of Reid and his
followers ; it believes in the alleged Protec-
tionist and Federation policy of Dibbs and
his followers ; and it believes in almost all
the features of the alleged Labour pro-
gramme. But it disbelieves in the Reid
party because that party doesn’t believe in
its own land-tax scheme, and because it is
merely a grovelling agent for the Fat Man
and the importer; it disbelieves in the Dibbs
party because that body cares very little at
heart for Australian unity, because its Pro-
tection policy is miserably lukewarm, and
because it is also sold to the Fat Man and
the National Ass ; and it disbelieves in the
Labour - party because, though its prin-
ciples are wide and noble, its practice is
narrow and bigoted, and its decisive triumph
under present circumstances would only
result in the formation of a Ministry from
which the most enlightened democrats would
be excluded, for no other reason than that
they are not sons of manual labour, and have
on their brains instead of on their hands the
warts of toil. In short, this paper has long
since lost its faith in parties. But it will
give its utmost support to any man or party
or organisation which will put in the fore-
front of its programme the establishment of
the Referendum and the abolition of Party
Government, so that thereafter the country
may be rid of parties—as the term is now
understood—altogether, and for ever.
The Priesthood of Pump.
Herbert Spencer notes the curious fact that
the more things improve the louder become the
exclamations about their badness. “A century
ago, when scarcely a man could be found who
was not occasionally intoxicated, and when
inability to take one or two bottles of wine
brought contempt, no agitation arose against
the vice of drunkenness ; but now that, in the
course of fifty years, the voluntary efforts of
temperance societies, joined with more general
causes, have produced comparative sobriety,
there are vociferous demands for laws to pre-
vent the ruinous effects of the liquor traiiic.”
These demands take no account of the
wishes or character of the people. The
faith of the liquor prohibitionist in
the power of law to destroy natural
appetites is alone sufficient to discredit his
intelligence. For all history, all philosophy,
endorses Buckle’s dictum that “ to seek to
change opinions by laws is worse than futile.
It not only fails, but it causes a reaction which
leaves the opinion stronger than ever. First'
alter the opinions, and then you may alter the
law.” Thus the success of the prohibition
movement in Maoriland is bound to cause a
reaction proportioned to its success. Possibly,
with the aid of women’s votes, the ideal of the
pump fanatic will be reached, and the manu-
facture, sale, and use of intoxicating liquors
Avill be absolutely forbidden by law. What
will follow ? This : the law will be in-
operative in proportion to the number of men
who refuse to submit to the attack upon their
liberty. If these are in the minority, the traffic
prohibited by law will be carried on in spile of
the law, and with worse results to the com-
munity than at present. If they are in jthe
majority, the law will not be enforced. The
efficacy of women’s votes is largely overrated.
They are effective only as they are backed by
the votes of the men, or in questions upon
which men are indifferent. Should an issue
arise which divides the sexes into hostile camps,
and the women have a nominal constitutional
majority, the men will simply appeal to force.
That is the final test of supremacy.

The weakness of the Prohibition case has
recently been illustrated in Sydney by the Rev.
L. M. Is ITT, a Maoriland lecturer with a glib
tongue, a tine talent for buffoonery, and the
versatile impudence of a quack corn-doctor.
Now, it is easy to pile up blazing rhetoric about
the evils of drink. It is easy to tickle the ears
of the groundlings with coarse witticisms and
coarser sarcasm. But it is hard to compose a
consecutive argument which deals with every
fact and answers every objection. It is hard to
see truth steadily and see it whole, when one is
earning a good living as a paid advocate of a
single side of truth. Men of the I sett stamp,
even when they know better, will always
choose ease, and shun difficulty. They will
always prefer to fool fanatics to the top
of their bent, rather than try and con-
vince reasoning men. That is precisely
what the Reverend Isitt did. His lec-
tures were excellently calculated to charm
emotional ignorance and disgust critical intelli-
gence. He never supplied a fact where he
could substitute a sounding phrase ; he never
arrayed an argument when he could introduce
clap-trap invective. Even when he spoke the
truth ho suppressed the side which did not suit
him. He told his audience that at the medical
conference in Holland last year, the Dutch
doctors advocated total abstinence. He did
not tell them that the British section, through
its president, Dyce Duckworth, spoke in favour
of moderate drinking. He said that the fact
that the prohibition States in America had not
altered the law show’ed that they were satisfied
with its effects. He did not say that of 17
States which have tried prohibition, ten have
abandoned it, and in the others the law is a
dead letter.
* * *
Prohibition has failed signally in the United
States. This is the conclusion of an authorita-
tive and impartial observer, Mr. Michael
Herbert, to the British Embassy at
Washington, whose observations are published
in a report on “ Liquor Legislation in the
United States,” recently issued by the British
Foreign Office. Prohibition has failed signally
in Canada. The Scott Act, which gives to
every province the power to stop the sale of
drink within its own borders, is—the present
writer, who lately travelled in Canada, speaks
by the card—inoperative ; and the cry is now
for Dominion prohibition, which only a war
could force upon Lower Canada. Prohibition
would fail signally in Australia. It has been
tried at Mildura, with the result of demoralising
the community, and the residents have now by
a three to one majority decided to do
away with it. Not Here, where the senti-
ment of liberty is so strongly rooted, can
such an intolerable tyranny be established.
Everyone who thinks sees this. What
man of note, what man of intellect, ad-
vocates prohibition in Australia ? What news-
paper approves it? Its supporters are the
diseased brains of the community, the un-
healthy minds in unhealthy bodies, the men of
stunted physique, narrow foreheads, pimply
faces, flabby muscles, shrunken legs. Take
New South Wales Parliament as representing
the people. Compare G. D. Clark and Hindle,
leading abstainers, with Dibbs and Parke?,
leading drinkers. On which side are the brains,
the manliness, the vitality ? Will anybody
back Clark for two rounds with Dibbs ? Will
anybody wager that Hindle will be a father at
70 ? The contrast everywhere holds good.

The craving for intoxicants is natural and
universal. The ability to manufacture intoxi-
cants marks the great division between man
and brute. Once evolution progressed so far
that the prehistoric ape-man learnt how to
make a ferment, the rest was easy. Civilisa-
tion followed as a matter of course. And all
through history the nation that loved its liquor
was never beaten except by the nation that
loved its liquor better. Rome, founded
on wine, conquered the world, and fell
partly because, after the introduction of
Christianity, the quality of the wine deterior-
ated ; while the heathen Gothic beer was
unadulterated and strong. The golden age
of England was the beer age, the age
of Elizabeth, the age of Drake and
Shakspere, when tea, coffee, and cocoa were
unknown, and men, women, and children
drank humming ale continuously. Scandina-
vians are to-day the biggest and strongest men
in Europe—also the most drunken. Germany
is the strongest military nation, with the most
enormous beer-consumption. In fact, the world
has never been sober since the dawn of history.
If there were any truth in the eloquent
pictures of diseased livers at which teetotallers
groan, the race would have been extinct long
ago. And English medical men are now begin-
ning to find out that districts where tea and
sop predominate show a yearly loss of vitality,
while the brutal beer and meat consumer dies a
centenarian with 37 children.

It is no use arguing that if Australia gave up
drinking she would save ever so many millions
a year. If she gave up food and clothing
and went to roost in a tree every night she
would save ever so much more. But she is not
going to do anything of the sort. A purely
vegetable existence may satisfy the apostle of
Pump, but it is far too languid and uninterest-
ing for a young and lusty nation, which means
to eat its bread with joy and drink its wine
with a merry heart, and live joyfully with
the wife whom it loveth all the days of
the life of its vanity. Drink is a natural
instinct, and the desire of morbid zealots to
suppress it is of a piece with the unwholesome
sanctity which refrains from marrying and
washing itself and paring its nails in order to
keep the carnal man under. The world is
gradually learning that the carnal man cannot
be kept under ; that natural instincts are right,
and need only regulation in the light of experi-
ence. We have too long crucified the flesh at
the bidding of bigot creeds; and monasticism
and asceticism, in blighting life, have strangled
progress. Luckily, human nature is elastic,
and human appetites are crushed only to rise
again.
“ Well,” murmured one, “ let whoso make or buy,
My Clay with long Oblivion is gone dry;
But fill me with the old familiar Juice,
Methinks I might recover by and by.”
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Triumph of Tea.
Maoriland goes the pace. A S.M. Herald
correspondent gives a graphic picture of the
results of local option under the Act of 1892.
Never was such an overturning, of precedents,
preconceptions, and habits. The trite truth,
whi(h every generation of legislators slowly
learns, that it is one thing to make a law and
another thing to foresee its results, has received
quaint and delightful illustration, and the
country is aghast at its own handiwork. The
Act is for ever bobbing up serenely in unex-
pected places. To make it effective in any
district half the voters must vote. The electoral
law punishes those who do not vote by striking
their names off the roll. The framers of this
law certainly never intended it to apply to a
licensing-poll. But it does, or it is held to ;
and those who stayed away through careless-
ness, or of wicked intention, find themselves
disfranchised. Yet their negligence in many
districts leaves things as they were. In
others, where the hydropliilista hr on edit half


the voters to the poll, strange things
have happened. The new licensing-com-
mittees have closed hotels by the score, and
with a fine contempt of the fitness of things.
In Invercargill, a leading commercial hotel,
accommodating 40 boarders, was closed ; while
many others with much smaller accommoda-
tion remain open. This was done by secret
ballot, and the Supreme Court is to test
the legality of the proceeding. In Wellington
three°very old hotels were closed. At Dun-
edin, no less than 26 were extinguished,
and the first result in loss of license-fees, gas
and water rates, and other ways, is a reduction
of municipal revenue by .£6OOO per annum, in-
volving an additional 6d. rate. Water must
pay for its whistle. In the Clutha farming
district, the committee decided to refuse
licenses before hearing applications, and were
very properly told by the presiding magistrate
that such conduct stamped them as incapable
of exercising judicial functions. Then he pro-
ceeded to grant wholesale licenses by the dozen,
so that the Clutha farmer simply carries home
his beer in a barrel instead of in a jug or in his
stomach. And all over the province, while
hotels are closed, “working men’s clubs,”
which can sell liquor all day, all night, and
all Sunday, are in full blast, and doing splen-
did business. It is the task of legislative
teetotallers to stop this leak during the
present session of Parliament. Already they
have shown their mettle by the . abolition
of the Parliamentary refreshment-bar by 27
votes to 24, Premier Seddon voting with the
minority. Since there are 74 members in the
House of Representatives this may not be con-
clusive, yet it is thought that on the liquor
question Stout has a majority. That majority
expresses its determination never to stop short
of full prohibition. At Auckland, the prohibi-
tionists are so confident of success that they
thought it of no use organising for the local
option poll, and hotels there remain as formeily.
So Maoriland is to see a glorious set-to between
fanaticism and human nature. The Bulletin
backs human nature at 70,000 to 1.
A Matter of Evidence.
Melbourne Punch, in a recent issue, thus
muses over the recently-discharged assassin,
Bertrand : ,
It was really pathetic to see him walking about the deck
of the Austral. The years and years spent in prison, with
chains round his legs, gave him a peculiar shuffling walk
—a painful dragging of one leg after the other which,
will serve to mark him as a criminal as long as he lives.
As a fair example of how evidence is manufac-
tured, this statement is interesting. Bertrand,
as it happened, didn’t wear any chains at all
during the “ years and years.” spent in prison.
Like many other gentlemanly felons of note and
long standing, he gradually drifted into the
position of a privileged inmate, and spent a
great part of his time in painting pictures and
adorning his cell with nic-nacs. He also played
the organ in church on Sundays, and assisted in
the hospital, and was the patriarch and show
inmate of the establishment generally. There-
fore, he didn’t acquire the aforesaid “painful
dragging of one leg after the other ” —in fact,
he walks very much like any other man.
The Punch man evidently got his ideas of
that remarkable gait through seeing Dam-
pier playing the part of Jean Valjean,
the French galley-slave, and having decided
that the peculiarity should be there, he recog-
nised it at a glance despite its absence. If
Bertrand had been wanted by the police, and
his identification depended on that alleged
dragging of the feet, which wasn’t there, the
same credible witness would probably have
recognised and sworn to it in the same con-
scientiously stupid fashion. Most witnesses,
in fact, don’t see what they really do see ; they
simply see what they had previously made up
their minds that they were going to see. This
is one of the great secrets of police-court identi-
fication. Any person who studies the devious
ways of justice must notice that the man who
is rightly convicted, and the man who after-
wards proves to have been wrongly convicted,
are identified with just the same certainty.
The average, witness goes to court with a pre-
conceived idea that the person in the dock is the
person who should he there ; he sees a brutal-
looking face behind; the spikes—all faces lobk
brutal behind the spikes; even Paul before Fbstus
would have seemed the ideal of a garrotter if
the modern dock had been in use in those days
—and he promptly sees upon it the features of
the real criminal whether they are there or not.
If a squint, or a pair of abnormally large ears,
or some other peculiarity, is required to suit
the evidence he recognises it at the first glance,
just as the Melbourne pressman recognised in
Bertrand the obvious and unmistakable
results of a cause which didn’t exist. The
human 4 capacity for seeing what isn’t there
is practically illimitable. Even the early
Christians, who used habitually to meet with
devils arid angels, and to see the dead walking
out of iheir graves, were no more ridiculous
than their modern descendants ; the difference
lies solely in the fact that the early Christian was
constantly expecting to, meet devils and the
late Christian isn’t. The same rule applies to
the mediaeval person who frequently met with
wehr-wolves and witches riding on broomsticks
and similar trifles ; the kind of witness who is
always at hand to help along a Mount Rennie
hanging would meet any day in
Collins-street, Melbourne, if that animal was in
fashion and there was any demand for it.
"Someday, when a “History of Evidence ” is
produced, in 48 large volumes, this peculiarity
of the human mind will, perhaps, receive the
attention, which it deserves, and the obtrusive
cocksureness of the average stipendiary magis-
trate ami J.P. will receive a severe shock in
consequence.
\’Che Bitter Cry of Outcast Rue /
Australians.
The Bulletin has received from Villa Rica,
Paraguay, the following letter ;—-
Editor Bullbtin, —We are ex-members of the New
Australian Cooperative Settlement Association, having
arriv cl with the second hatch. We found on arrival that
we had been systematically deceived with respect to the
nature of tic country, the conditions under which we
were to work, and the events that h id taken place at the
settlement since its first, formation, about six months ago;
and that, this system of deception was still, as far as pos-
sible, be ing kept up, that everything that was done was
done in secret, and that every means by which we might
be able to receive information from outside was carefully
guarded by the man whom, in a moment of enthusiasm,
we had elected to be “ supreme executive authority
and his satellites. All their care in this way, however,
could not prevent some information from reaching us,
and thus we awoke to the fact that we had been fooled and
“had ” Briefly, we understood that the land we were about
to colonise was uninhabited. Judgeour surprise, on arrival
to find that it was more thickly populated than most
parts of what are called “ the settled districts of Aus-
tralia,” and that with regard to these old residents a
cruel process of “ eviction ” was going on—a thing which
we would never consent to be parties to. Our protest,
however, ivas of no avail ; because, notwithstanding the
fact that this association was supposed to be run on
democratic principles, the government was actually the
most despotic it is possible to conceive, the “Supreme
Executive Authority ” having taken it on himself to dis-
regard entirely the basis upon which the association was
formed, and absolutely refusing to account in any way,
or to give any information whatever with regard to the
affairs of the association, to us, who, up to that tune, had
supposed ourselves to lie co partners in the venture, each
with an equal stiare in the profits and an equal voice in
the management. All our attempts to obtain information
with regard to our position or the proprietorship of the
land, or to ascertain the financial condition of the asso-
ciation were systematically bluffed ; and, therefore,
thoroughly disgusted, w e packed up the few personal
effects we had and launched ourselves on the world to
work our way as best we could in a country
where we hardly know a word of the language.
We wish to warn anv persons who may possibly
be led away by the glowing reports of the pro-
gress of the Association, which are being continually
published, that the affair appears to us to be a deliberate
job ; and that, so far from being conducted on social
democratic principles, we do not think it is possible to
conceive any system more opposed to those principles. It
is in reality an oligarchy, in which a few men hold alt the
power, and the position of the rest is one of positive
slavery. Before leaving Australia a telegram was read to
us from Paraguay saying that eight (8) persons had left
the settlement. On arrival we found that before that
telegram was sent eighty-five (85) had left. We merely
mention this as a sample of the way that we have been
deceived. Whenever a truth was told us by those in
authority we used to treasure it up as a curiosity. The
lowest sum that any of ns paid into the Association was
£6O sterling. On leaving, we were offered 25 Paraguay
dollars —in English money, 15s. llpl. Some of us accepted
this, because we did not wish to start in aforeigncountry,
under the circumstances, without a cent in our pockets;
others refused it altogether. Hoping that this letter may
have the effect of making those who have any intention
of ioining the movement look before they leap, we are,
yours—

This speaks for itself. The Bulletin is sorry
for the writers, and it doesn’t believe in jumping
on a man when he’s down. All the same, New
Australia has got to teach Old Australia a
lesson, which is this : that Australians may go
farther and fare worse. With all its drawbacks,
our country is the best country in the world for
the working man, and it rests with working
pien themselves to make it better. They can do
it if they like. W-hat could not the enthusiasm,
the energy, and the capital squandered in New
Australia have done in any province of the group?
It is no use saying that the laws hinder. What
is wrong in the laws can be altered by men who
are true to themselves and to each other. The
laws have not hindered others from succeeding,
and what one man has done others may do,
especially when helped by fellowship and strung
by a high ideal. Nearly all the wealth of Aus-
tralia is but a generation old. The “capi-
talists ” of to-day were the toilers of twenty or
thirty years ago. Take the richest of them all:
what but labour, high intelligence, and self-
denial, applied to the business of money making,
has lifted him from poverty ? His is a sordid
example, a pitiful aim ; but lie stands in a
country where money is the general god, to
show making all due allowances for the
special opportunities of the hyegone times —
that the avenues to success in Australia are
open to the humblest. And if the writers
of this letter were deceived, they were deceived
with their eyes open, after repeated warn-
ings. The Bulletin is weary of the old
Adam who gets up so persistently to say it
wasn’t his fault, and shove the blame on to
somebody else. That won’t do. It was the
foolish little pig that w'ent to Paraguay : the
wise little pig stayed at home. And, while
grass grows and rivers run, men must sutler
for their folly. It is right ami just that it
should he so. If you put your finger into fire
it burns you; if you put your head under water
it drowns you; and if you go and make a
prodigal of yourself in Paraguay, you will
probably chew a fine assortment of husks before
you get back again. Such punishment is the
index of broken law. It is old Mother Nature’s
method of teaching her silly children the way in
which the world is governed. It is lucky she is
patient; for w T e learn very slowly. Everybody
goes to Paraguay once in a lifetime; hut
Joseph Conlan and the rest went twice, and
put an actual froth on top of the metaphorical
drink from the bitter cup of experience. What
is the settlement assejeiation going to do for
them? It has taken their money by misrepre-
sentation ; it has bamboozled them with oratory
and printer’s ink ;it has landed them desolate
on a foreign shore ;is it going to leave them in
the lurch ? It looks very like it. The intend-
ing pilgrims have been sent home again, and
the association’s ship has been hired out to a
stranger. If this is equality, fraternity, the new
order" and the brotherhood of man, in the name
of the incorruptible Robespierre, give us
rather “ the cut-throat competition of our
social savagery ! ”
The Gentle Art of Gulling People.
Parkes, the inimitable poser, gets cheers from
crowded election meetings by denouncing the
“ abominable Electoral Act”—which must be
repealed forthwith. Not so fast ! The
“abominable Electoral Act” is the single
measure by which the Dibbs Ministry deserves
to he remembered ;it is the most valuable Act
which has been placed upon the New South
Wales Statute-book for many a year. Its worth
is none the less that Premier Dibbs, Repub-
lican turned Royalist, is heartily sorry that he
ever put a finger to it; and is doing his level
best to lessen the terrible weight of its influence
for Democracy. Parkes, with all his years of
office and all his opportunities, with all his
brag and bluster, never wished, never dared,
to pass such an Act. Parkes’s Brutus like
enthusiasm for the destinies of Australia,
his yearning to offer up the*'*’*scanty remnant of
my life” on the altar of patriotism, are visible
only at election-times. Parkes brims over
with pathos when he is out of luck. v hen in
office, he spends his “declining years in hold-
ing on to power with tooth and eyelid, and
sacrificing “ the destinies of Australia to the
exigencies of the road-and-bridge members.
Parkes is at hair a hater of Democracy.
He yearns to bind nascent Australia to
the foot of the British monarchy with his
“ blanky crimson clothesline.” Small wonder
that such a man, not daring to oppose
it openly, seeks to destroy the Act upon side-
issues. Small wonder that the Conservative
press of Sydney is never tired of pointing out
its deficiencies ; and pity that so many demo-
crats should have been misled to follow ! Why,
the Act is the new charter of New South Wales
liberty. It is a measure of radical electoral
reform. It gives pure manhood suffrage,
abolishing the iniquitous plural vote ; it gives
one-day elections ; it does its best to make the
representation of the people full, and the
machinery of representation perfect. Of course,
it fails in details—what measure so new and so
important does not ? When ever did the wit of
man foresee all the consequences of a law? Of
course, it, seems hard to work at first; what
complicated measure does not? Every change
involves accommodation by gradual use. The
Act must be amended —yes ; but repealed
emphatically never ! It has been won too
hardly to be parted with lightly.
Patterson’s Credit Poncier.
The Victorian Land Bank scheme, as it is
gradually unfolded in Parliament, proves to be
just the sort of scheme which might be ex-
pected from the Government of a land-
boom country. The ostensible purpose of
the measure is to raise money on State security
at 4 per cent., and lend it on mortgage to the
farmer at 5 per cent., so as to relieve him from
the usury to which he is now subjected—a per-
fectly legitimate and feasible scheme, as the ex-
perience of Continental Europe has proved for
many years past. But the Patterson Go-
vernment refuse to see that their Credit
Foncier Bill is full of suspicious pro-
visions, apparently put in for the express
purpose of enabling the proposed institution to
go queer at the earliest possible date. The
proviso that the Commissioners, instead of hold-
ing office during good conduct, should retire
annually in rotation, and their successors be
appointed by the Cabinet, makes the control of
the Land Bank a convenient piece of political
patronage. Also, it enables the Government
to keep the Commissioners in a state of due
subserviency in the hope of retaining their
billets. The proposal to restrict loans to a
maximum of £IOOO was promptly extinguished;
the £IOOO limit is quite sufficient if the measure
is intended for the relief of the agricul-
turist only, but —well, it would not suit
a whole lot of people in the city of
the Busted Land Boom. It is decreed, how-
ever, that no loan of over £IOOO is to be made
without “ the sanction of the Minister,” so
every large loan which is granted is an item of
political patronage, and can he made an equiva-
lent for political support. The Bill practically
authorises the Ministry to over-ride the Com-
missioners’ decision, and to order the granting
of loans on almost any security they may
think fit. Also, the Ministry may forbid the
foreclosure of mortgages that are in arrear.
Under these circumstances, every borrower who
wants public money on bad security will
harry his local member to get it for him,
and the member will harry the Minister,
and the Credit Foncier funds will, in
the long run, be practically given away
to purchase political support. No Com-
missioner may lend the public money to a
company of which he is a director, but, accord-
ing to the original bill, he might lend it to a
company of not loss than 20 persons in which
he was oidy an “ordinary shareholder.” Under
these circumstances every commissioner would
invariably be about the most ordinary share-
holder imaginable. The Credit Foncier is to
take over the Savings Bank business, and
Savings Bank funds, it leaked out in
debate, have already been lent to com-
panies in which officials are personally inter-
ested. Particulars of these loans are not avail-
able. Altogether, the State Land Bank
promises to be an enormously enlarged and
bloated edition of the Mercantile or the Federal,
and when it has existed for a few years on the
Patterson plan, and grown to its full size, the
“revelations ” should be something such as the
world hasn’t seen or heard of since the days of
Panama. Even MTlwraith’s land-grant rail-
way project doesn’t contain greater possibilities
of corruption than the Patterson Credit
Foncier.
The Reign of Brummagem.
Dear Bulletin, —I must differ With “Theo-
dore Woinarski ” in your last issue,
especially in his general statement that the
political influx of foreigners into Australia is
merely a question of figures and averages. If
he reads his Sydney Daily Telegraph regu-
larly he’ll see that the candidates won’t obey
the law of averages —they’ll see the law of
averages damned first —and will go to the poll
in the teeth of the law of averages, and in
defiance of simple proportion. I won’t dispute
“ T.W.’s ” figures, as I haven’t got Coghlan
handy, but I think Coghlan says, in the
“Seven Colonies of Australasia,” that the pro-
portion of natives all round to the wdiole popu-
lation is as 61 to 100. I agree with “ T.W.”
that there is such a thing as love of country
—which includes patriotism. The native-born
Australian has only one country to love,
while the “foreign” candidate has two. A
man who has two countries, especially if he
evinces a blackguard haste to govern No. 2,
must be a mercenary —he must keep a political
harem. There is also the danger—not an un-
substantial one—of the double-barrelled patriot
legislating with one eye on each, and with a
consequent squint. We know that there are
certain ’igh persons who look for praise and
reward, not within New South Wales, but
towards a certain little island in the direction
of the soles of our feet. Patterson doesn’t
care what Victorians think of him, except in
Castlemaine—he has his weather eye on Aln-
wick, in Northumberland, where he is looked
upon as a little deity and held up —ye gods !
as an example for youthful emulation. But,
enough. I am happy to say that if the law of
simple proportion dooms us to short commons
in the matter of quantity, we have quality
right enough, for most of the bright debaters in
last New South Wales Parliament were native-
born.—Yours, Cornstalk.
♦
The Piddington Complication.
The curious situation of Mr. “ Turkey ” Pin
dington, jun., Foreign-trade candidate fo
Tamworth (N.S.W.) has served of late to bring
that very small politician into unwonted pro-
minence. Mr. Piddington was a lecturer in
Sydney University, and being to a great extent
paid by public endowments, he was regarded in
some quarters as practically a civil servant, and
as such a person who ought to be disqualified
for Parliament. At the same time he was not a
recognised civil servant, so the disqualification
was not a legal but only a sentimental one, and
not very sentimental at that. Mr. Piddington
some time ago announced his intention to con-
test the Tamworth seat in the Foreign-trade
interest, and to this no objection was made, so
far as the public are aware. But later on,
when he applied for leave of absence in order
to stump the constituency, the application was
met with a flat refusal, consequently Mr. Pid-
dington was unable to address his intended
constituents, and if his election depended upon
his personal influence he was practically out of
the running. A remarkable side issue turns up
for consideration just about here. Some time
ago Education Minister Suttor positively re-
fused to entertain an application by the Univer-
sity Senate for an additional endowment to its
pompous and not particularly useful institution,
and promised instead a substantial reduction in
the existing allowance. About the time of the
Piddington upheaval, however, Premier Dibbs
suddenly and unaccountably assured that august
body that the increase petitioned for would be
granted if he returned to ofiice. Therefore, the
Senate has a powerful cash inducement to do
all it can, in its own humble and not especially
brilliant fashion, to secure the return of
that long and spectacled politician, and under
these circumstances the Foreign-trade press
puts forward, as definitely as it can without risk
of the libel law, these alternative assumptions ;
(1) that the Senate refused Piddington leave
of absence lest he should go to Tamworth and
there utterly blast Dibbs and thus wreck the
promised endowment; and (2) that the endow-
ment was promised tacitly on condition that
the Senate sat on Piddington, wherefore
Piddington was sat upon accordingly. The
evidence on one side is that there is no visible
honest reason for Dibbs’ sudden and altogether
needless change of policy with regard to the
University endowment. The evidence on the
other side is that Dibbs’ policy is always chang-
ing without any reason, and he is only' con-
sistent and unchangeable when there is some
one to be hanged. Also, if he had succeeded
in preventing the weak and harmless Pidding-
ton from doing his own canvass at Tam-
worth, the Freetrade party would almost
inevitably have sent up some one to act
on his behalf, and as that person could
hardly be less influential than Piddington
the change was almost sure to be for the worse.
Further the Senate, which is habitually lofty
and cantankerous, may easily have acted as it
did from purely cross-grained motives; the
fact that Mr. Piddington announced his candi-
dature first and applied for leave of absence
afterwards was eminently calculated to raise
the bile of such an organisation and aggravate
its small dignity. Also, it may have acted as
it did from mere formalism, without its dignity
being aggravated ; or it might have been incited
by the Foreign-trade party with a view to
raising a prejudice against Mr. Dibbs. Alto-
gether the Piddington embroglio is a many-
sided complication. The one thing that is
certain about it is that Premier Dibbs
committed an act of ghastly foolishness
in promising a subsidy on his own
responsibility, at a time when all sub-
sidies are suggestive of bribery and corruption;
and that he was grossly discourteous in can-
celling Minister Suttor’s decision upon a matter
that lay in Mr. Sdttor’s own department.
Meanwhile, Mr. Piddington, having resigned
his University billet, goes on his interrupted
canvass, so to all practical purposes the incident
is closed and only the effluvium remains.
The Camel Odious!
The camel insupportable ! The camel an
offence and a stumbling-block in a civilised
country ! How Major Leonard would rub his
eyes could he be transported suddenly from
England to Bourke on the magic Arabian
carpet ! Why, this case-hardened soldier,
with sixteen years’ camel-commissariat ex-
perience, in his just - published (Longmans)
book on “ The Camel,” becomes all but a
poet in his enthusiasm for the invaluable
drudge of humanity. He looks back into the
dim dawn of history in the East ; and, far
as the eye can penetrate, sees still the camel
jolting patiently on his interminable journey,
living hard, working hard, embruted and
coarsened by continual ill-treatment, his fine
intelligence dulled by the cruelty of savage
nomads, his noble capacities degraded to the
uses of a boast - of - all - work, yet dreeing
his monotonous weird with discontented re-
signation, a fatalist without fear, without
joy, without hope ! Indeed, little is wanting
for Major Leonard to apply Shakespere’s
apostrophe, and say : “ What a piece of work
is a camel 1 How noble in reason ! How infinite
in faculties 1 in form and moving how unusually
express and admirable ! in action, how like an
angel; in apprehension, how like a god ! the
beauty of the world ! the paragon of animals !”
But the Major is truthful ; he admits that his
pet is neither beautiful nor intelligent : hard
work has destroyed the camel’s msthetic
qualities and constituted him on a severe
basis of utility. There, in dry country, the
camel shines like a star. He is tougher,
faster, longer lived, and cheaper (initial
cost over) than either horse or bullock ; and his
ability to do without food or water at a pinch

is a pre-eminent advantage. Horses, says Major
Leonard, soon get used to camels; their fear is
not instinctive, or due to the camel’s smell, but
is merely the effect which any strange object—
such as a train, tram or bicycle—produces on
their nervous organisation. And when the
Major ends by assuring us that he has no doubt
that Australians, “ with the usual energy and
determination which they infuse into every-
thing they take in hand, will pay the serious
attention to the camel question of which it is
deserving,” what remains but to abolish our
Afghan (“ the dirtiest brute on record,” says
the Major), and set to work in earnest to make
our camel profitable ?
What is the difference, as a party politician,
between Pabkes and the solidarity Labour
candidates? Parses said in North Sydney
School of Arts that both Freetraders and Pro-
tectionists should give up squabbling over the
fiscal question. He explained that this did not
mean an abandonment of the matter in dispute,
but only a postponement of it till Federation be
achieved. On the other hand, the phrase of
the solidarity Labour-party is—“ Sink the fiscal
issue 1” Till when ? Only till certain legisla-
tive results affecting Labour are achieved.
Those, or many at least of those, who “ sink ”
the fiscal issue mean exactly what Parkes
means when he “ postpones ” it ; and when he
expresses the hope that Federation will be
secured in two years and the decks be cleared
for a fiscal fight, he again merely uses “ Federa-
tion ” where the fiscal-sinkers use “ Labour
legislation.” Yet Parkes denounces these
sinkers as “ no men,” and these sinkers return
the compliment.

The poor banks hare a lob bo contend'with. One
bank holds shares (on which there is a liability o 1 over
£16,000) in the name of one of its employes, getting £9O
a year. All efforts made by the 00. to call up the £15,000
having failed, it hit on the ingenious plan of offering
the a permanent billet of £250 a year, if he could
get the bank to give him an indemnity against his lia-
bility. The bank threatened “ sack " if he persisted in
his demand, but at last had to give the indemnity. Four
days later the ex-bank-clerk had the satisfaction of serving
the bank with a writ for the £15,000 odd liability for
which he had been indemnified by them.

One of the conditions in a big co.’s reconstruc-

pay the first call within a specified time, immediately
become liable to pay up the other whole balance callable,
which is otherwise spread over a long period. Considering
what a vast amount of the liability is held by one Southern
bank (which intitted some years ago in making an over-
drawn customer transfer to it all his shares in the co.) it’s
little wonder that the first call has been responded
to magnificently.

The next half-yearly meeting of Melb. Metro-
politan Gas Co. is likely to be a very painful event for
those short-sighted capitalists who bought their shares
upon a calculation of perennial 20 per cent. divs. Also,
the aggressive person who desires to abolish kero-
sene with a prohibitive duty may as well prepare a
flaming harangue to suit the occasion. The gas-monopoly
is tottering, and only a vigorous change of policy can
save it from coming quite to grief. The company, by
fatuously trying to squeeze the old amount of profit from
a diminished constituency, has given a tremendous im-
petus to the lamp-trade, and at the present rate of
secession there will soon be no gas consumers left to
grumble over the inflation of their accounts.
Formerly ib was the oo.’s policy to bolster up
the profits with a view to selling the property to Govern-
ment at a price based upon the div. per centage, but now
that golden dream has evaporated, and the management
must either provide a good show of gas on reasonable
terms, or lower its limp flag to the cheap but reliable oil-
lamp. There is some pathos in the situation. The co.
has ceased to be very arrogant, and the collector has
apparently been instructed to plead gently for payment
of two months’ arrears lest the customer, already coquet-
ting with the idea of a new and improved lamp, should
bid his oppressors cut off the gas and be d d.

In Maoriland, when some dead and probably
unidentifiable remains are found in the bush, the local
authorities proceed to realise the “estate” of the
deceased, and the balance is forwarded, together with an
elaborate statement of accounts, to the Public Trustee, to
await claimants. One balance-sheet reads as follows :
“ Found on the deceased, 2Jd. Paid into Colonial
Treasury, 2Jd.” That was a good many years ago, but
the 2Jd. still lies waiting in the Public Trust Office, and
if the descendants of the corpse turn up anytime between
now and the day when Maoriland is finally annexed by
the Chinese, they will find the coppers all ready to be
handed over. This is where the State gets ahead of the
private trustee ; it is next door to immortal, and even
an unclaimed balance of 2Jd. will wait patiently through
the long procession of the centuries till the rightful
owner arrives. Wanted, everywhere, a Public Trust Office.

tion shown them, by their being compelled to renew
licences and to plank down £3O in the depth of winter,
instead of at the beginning of the year, when their trade

That fearsome speculation, the Midland Rail-

would have cost to build the line as a State institution,
and there is nothing to show for it all save an embarrassed
company and a financial scandal which will make Westralia

Dear Bulletin, —Really there has been no bigger
malefactor in Melbourne than Mat. Larkin, the caged
convict, as you call him. Unpunished men have practi-
cally embezzled much larger sums of money than Larkin
was able to get hold of, but he took everything he could
conveniently collar with cold-blooded regularity. A
struggling man would pay money over the counter to
jolly Matthias, and jolly Matthias would put it in his
pocket, without even going through a form of crediting
it to the poor devil’s account. He was not so much a
reckless gambler with other people’s cash, as an impudent
thief who undoubtedly had a lot of stuff “ planted ’* some-
where before he went away to “do his little bit.” Let
him do a bit more, if only to call further attention to the
swindlers who escape prosecution.—Yours, South MEL-

Premier Patterson’s auctioneer brother was
selling some Melb. suburban properties last week (on the
bank deposit receipt system) when he confidently
stated that the depression had concluded and
confidence was now restored—which makes the 49th
time of restoration within the last sixteen months. The
gall was in the silent insinuation that brother James had
given the auctioneer a straight tip upon the subject—had,
in fact, abolished depression and guaranteed an improve-
ment in prices for “freehold estate." With reckless
inconsistency, though, the auctioneer announced that
deposit receipts of the National, the Victoria, and the
London Bank of Australia would be accepted at their face
value, whilst other bank paper would have to go at the
ruling market price. Which was not very encouraging to
the confidence of people who have coin locked up in the
aforesaid other banks.

the other day demanded that his compositors should
agree to a reduction of their scale rates to 6d. per 1000

If they would accept the sixpenny rate he promised not
to introduce the machines for a year. Meeting with a
refusal, he urged a ninepenny rate, and he would not
introduce Linotypes for four months. Being again re-
fused, he gave notice that he would dismiss all but 25
comps., and that the Linotypes should come in as soon as
possible. The Typographical Association’s executive has
advised a “ strike." The Bulletin is afraid that the

_ Editor Bulletin.—Sir, —You have accurately
diagnosed the Mt. Hoaxley case from the first, but perhaps
you will permit me to add a few details. The report of
Mr. Samuel’s flowery address occupied three columns
in Hobart Mercury of 18th May. My short letter,
traversing and ridiculing Mr. Samuel’s statements,
was published alongside thereof. On 19th May Mr.
Montgomery was sent to inspect Mt. Huxley. The Mines
office was put on its guard by people here, but leading
officials scouted the idea that the Government geologist
could be imposed upon. On 28th May Mr. Montgomery
telegraphed There is a large auriferous formation in
places fairly rich. ... I think well of the property."
It was not till 7th June that Mr. Urquhart, M.H.A., at
my request, asked those questions in the House which
dragged forth the admission that the mine had been
“salted.” Mr. Montgomery has since amply vindicated
his excellent reputation, but the fact remains that from
28th May till 7th June the “velvet brigade” had every
facility given them to “unload” not only here but also
on the mainland.—Yours, etc., Theodore Bbvan, Hobart.

Stated that Begelhole, late manager of Bayley’s
Reward, has bought the Londonderry for £50,000 and a

nothing so unsatisfactory as the proverb about a bird in
the band. The bird in the hand invariably turns out a
wretched little victim of pip, while those in the bush are
fat as wild-duck in winter.

The prospective litigation with the Midland
Railway Co., also the Hampton Plains Syndicate, who are
alleged to claim that the Londonderry is on their con-
cessions, conveys yet another warning to the Democratic
party against land-grant lines and wholesale land-aliena-
tion. Here are prospectors facing, in the wilderness,

Queensland has just completed a successful half-
year in gold-production, with a total output of all but
300,0000 z. This is just up to the average, the return for
the past three years having gone a little over 600,0000 z. a
year. This regularity is rather surprising when the
diversity of factors included is considered.
Charters Towers is, of course, at the head of
the list with 111,418 tons, for 118,5440 z., last month’s
return being 19,141 tons, for 24,2330 z. Towers stone is
not crushing so well this year ns last, the yield in the
first half of 1893—135,8300 z. from 95,688 tons—being con-
siderably better. Qympie, on the other hand, has won-
derfully improved, the yield for the first half of ’93
being 27,3450 z. from 27,084 tons, while for '94
it is 54,2650 z. from 40,230 tons. Gympie mines are also
worked more economically, so that although they only
crushed 40,000 tons of stone to the Towers 111,000, they
yet paid £112,000 divs. as compared with £127,000 for the •
northern field.
The Gympie June yield was 10,0020 z. from
7599 tons stone, paying £22,558 in divs. The principal
contributor* were Phoenix Pile with £7200, Phoenix with
£6458, and N. Smithfleld with £6OOO. According to B.
Pope’s report, this was rather less than anticipated ; but
three important developments are noted during the
month—the cutting of black slate by the veteran 1 North
Phoenix in a winze down 212 feet from the 666 feet level,
sending shares from 9s. to 215.; the cutting of slate by 1
N. Smithfleld in the winze on the Columbia reef ; and the
cutting of the Wilmot reef in the eastern crosscut of the
1 South Phoenix. The market-value of shares generally
has risen during the month.
Mount Morgan gives the best part of 52,8480 z.
to the half-year's total; but Croydon is low down with
30,0790 z. The hopes of Croydon investors are gradually
falling. In most of the claims the gold gets leaded at a
depth, and the difficulty of working goes beyond profit-
pitch. The most promising claims on the field now are
the True Blue block, which recently crushed 2200 tons for
33860 z., and the True Blue Extended block. In the
average Croydon claim the normal state of things is one
of doubt and struggle.
That state is intensified on the Etheridge, where
the list of “hung-ups” is portentous and awful. The
Etheridge produced last half 11,0120 z., and Ravenswood
70590 z. —the latter showing a good rise, since the yield
for the whole of last year was only 92850 z. The Queen
Constance at Mareeba has had a very good crushing,
considering the bulk of stone, getting 883 oz. from 997
tons, paying a 6d. div,, and carrying £3OO forward.
* • • •
True Blue Block, Croydon (Q.), has declared 3d.
div. (£1250). This is rather a bullion than a gold-mine,
last four crushings showing gold (or bullion) worth from
325. to 35». 6d. per oz. A big diorite bar intersects this
property, but the lode is solid in deep ground behind. A
little more economy in working would benefit share-
holders.
• • • •
Ophir Block, Croydon (Q.), famous for its
33000 z. crushing, averaging nearly a lb. of gold to the
ton, is again coming to the front. Tributors are working
the big lode, raising 100 tons weekly, and plenty in sight.
Practically, the owner of the property, though he has
drawn much from it in profits, doesn't work it on his own
account, but prefers tributing. A few hundreds spent in
the bottom would soon prove the extent of the bar which
has nearly silenced work on Iguana Hill.
• • • •
Funny bub true. Bank charges at Croydon
field, Q. 2/2 per oz. of metal. Same institution only allows

loses 6d. for every oz. of silver he sells. Good business
for the banks.
• • * *
Mountain Maid United (Croydon, Q.) last
crushing, 120 tons for 128ozs. 6dwts., not up to expecta-

amount of precious metal in tailing-heap. This co. must
soon erect other appliances than stamper and berdan-pans
to save the gold from their extra-heavily-mineralised
stone.
• • * •
Wyalong reports two small crushings—2o tons
for 40-odd oz., and 30 tons for a yield so small that
the reporter is ashamed to mention it. There is a well-
founded impression current at Wyalong that if a little
“ cracking-up ” could attract some floating cash it would
help “ the field ” immensely. So when the Mallee Bull (a
really good claim) put up some 4x2 uprights and a bit of
bark over them the other, day, Sydney evening papers
duly announced that “ splendid poppet-heads had been
erected.”

cock jigs at Block 14. The South jigs, which operated
on a more favourable class of sulphide, are still shut. down.
Sulphide concentration on the Barrier is under a cloud.
Block 10 prospects do not improve with the
sinking of Campbell’s shaft. The shaft, now about, 40ft.
below the 1115 ft. level, is to be sunk another 100 ft., and
a crosscut put in east from the 1115 ft. level. What the
manager and directors expect to discover, either in the
shaft or crosscut, is difficult to say. Prospects at depth
are as forbidding as could be—in fact, Campbell’s shaft
and the famous deep crosscut from the Extended shaft,
into Central property, have proved that Broken Hill deep
sulphides—at the Block 10 end at least—are hopeless.
Recent rise in Centrals has been caused by the
development, beneath the curious white carbonate of lead
body about the 500 ft. level, of a silicinus granulated lead
body of less lead grad*, but averaging 40oz. silver. The
width of the latter has been proved 50ft., and assays
indicate at least 40oz. silver and 30 per cent, lead, with
only 12 per cent, zinc—a smelting grade. Other -nines
have intractable sulphide at this depth.

At Wyalong. Mr. Arthur Tremayne, well-
known in connection with the Mildura strike and the
founding of the Vic. Co-operative Irrigation Settlements,
is on the field for the purpose of starting a battery on the
lines of co-operation. The main features of the scheme
are:—l. That mine owners do not pay to become share-
holders until the calls are obtained from the stone. 2.
That shares cannot be used for speculation, because new
shares can be bought at par from the office of the com-
pany, and the maximum dividend is to be 10 per cent.

A good deal of dissatisfaction exists on the
Murchison owing to the paucity of news from the field in
the Eastern papers, as compared with that from Cool-
gardie. “It is the opinion of many that the Murchison
will be a large mining centre when Coolgardie is com-
paratively deserted,” says a correspondent. The old
story—
“ Quid Ireland was Quid Ireland
When England was a pup,
An’ Quid Ireland ’ll be Quid Ireland
When England’s swallowed up."

Thb Bulletin regrets having circulated an
erroneous statement in last issue about the new
alluvial rush at Garangula, Thb Bullktin is informed
that the leaseholder’s charges were wrongly quoted, the
correct charges beings 10S. per man per month for
each claim after gpld has been struck; no payment
being required prior to gold being struck. No
charge is made for sluicing, but the lease-
holder has to erect and maintain a sluice-box
at his own expense, each owner having the right
to wash his dirt' there. No miner is compelled to
have his carting done by the leaseholder, but if he so
desires it he can compel the leaseholder to do his carting
for Is. per load tor one mile and under; Is. 6d. per load
for any distance exceeding one mile and not exceeding
two miles; for any distance exceeding two miles at a
price to be mutually agreed upon. The only royalty
charged by Mr. Maoaush is 2s. per oz., that being the
royalty which he himself is compelled to pay to the

846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney,
July 10, 1894.
My Dear Mookabinda—
least no sweeping reflections on the sartorial
effects observable in the Land of Wooden Hams
(which, we all know, sticks a feather in its hat
and calls itself Yankee Doodle with most artistic
results) when I solemnly state that I never did
see so queerly-dressed a crowd as that which
advertised its nationality about Sydney streets on
the festive Fourth. I don’t think I will ever for-
get a lady in a costume barred like a zebra’s skin,
and a little s.s. banner flying as if she was a try-
your-weight machine. And another Oolumbienne
in a baggy, virtuous-heroine-looking cloak, with
her hair dyed, and her little flag flying from her
bowsprit, certainly upheld the Goddess of Liberty
—of costume, at least.
And most of the he-Americans whom I met had
on scrunch hats, and wore their hair long, and
wore flag boutonnieres, and one over-proof patriot,
who had evidently been mixing the beverages of
his native land, had a flag for every weskit button.
He looked like the signboard of a “ notion ’ -
shop. Of course, the “real elegant’’ Doodles
kept their eagles in their pockets, and if their
good example induced the other sort to leave their
flag at home it would only be fair to the great
and glorious country they represent. We know
that every American angel whom we entertain isn’t
a song-and-dance lady, but, upon my word, the
number of towy-headed impossibilities who flew
the stars-and-stripes on the Block, last Wednes-
day, looked as if America was one vast variety-
show.
To my idea —perhaps because there really is no
real Australian flag, so far, although the patriotic
“up and arise” bards write as if there is—a
person who hurls his banner at you, in a manner
of speaking, is a most unblushing egotist. “lam
a product of the glorious land of Dash. Gaze
your fill. This is indeed a Dasher,” is what a man
(or eke a woman) who ornaments himself with his
national rag on the least provocation seems to
breathe in every curve. And the more glorious
the country the greater the egotism ! Also, I’m
beginning to think that in this age of carefully-
balanced emotions, when every impulse is analysed
into an absurdity, flags and things like that are
getting played out as vehicles for genuine senti-
ment. So many stage-heroes have died fighting
frantically for the property banner amid a running
fire of caps that the whole business smells of the
footlights.
If women get the franchise in Australia I
predict with my eyes shut that the semi-nude
coryphee will have a serious rival in the he-
woraan. For example, only the other day at a
meeting held to encourage some itinerant shepherd
or other whose golosh had descended upon Sydney,
the president of N.S.W. Woman Suffrage League
said she thought that, in the coming century,
when women took hold of the work of the world,
they would also take off their gloves.
Now it always strikes me (though you musn’t
suppose for a moment that I’m trying to boom
the prospects of Woman Suffrage) that my strong-
minded sisters would peel down to Godiva-esque
proportions if they get the whip-hand. The
first thing a strong-minded woman does—no
matter how fat and wobblesome she may be—is to
cast off her corsets as a rattlesnake slips its skin;
her next step has always been to agitate for a
split in her garments that will show her qualifica-
tions for the ballet more piquantly than petticoats
do, and now, behold ! she threatens that she will
take off her gloves. Shedding her garments as
she goes along the road to Freedom (so’s she may
find her way back by them perhaps, on the
“Babes in the Wood ” principle !) it almost looks
as if my shrieking sisters would arrive at the top
of the poll in their birthday-suits.
Chatting about Woman Suffrage, I think they
must have a prettier and juicier set of political
pusses in boots up North than are those we suffer
from in the South. The other day a Bananaland
M.P. refused to address a W.F. meeting “ because
he never could speak before a lot of giggling
girls.” But I cannot picture a giggling she-
suffragist, can you? In fact, a little more giggling
would do the feminine-political atmosphere further
South heaps of good. In Sydney a W.F. meeting
is a solemn conclave of disappointed-looking ladies
in Vi liculous head-gear and dog’s-eared corners to
their mouths, who generally allude to men as
vipers, but who flutter like canaries with the cat
coming if they can only yard up one of the tyrants
to make pretty speeches from the platform.
“ Giggling girls !” He must have meant giggling
Gorgons.
By the way, one of the most shocking pieces of
disloyalty, not to say treason, I have met with for
years is the latest portrait of Her Gracious
Majesty Queen Victoria in a recent fashionable
London illustrated. H.M. is represented as a lady
the corners of whose mouth are more turned down
than those of any other woman on record. The
very first lesson in physiognomy that should be
learnt by mankind is—never marry a girl—even
a princess—whose mouth-corners turn down.
St. John’s Ambulance Association—founded in
Australia by Lady; Brassey—still keeps its head
in front of the myriad fads of the period, and when
ambulancing is taken up by intelligent people,
who don’t bind up the unbroken leg and leave the
injured member flapping, there is much to be said
in favour of it. But the St. John’s A.A.
enthusiasts go deeper than mere broken bones. At
a recent meeting held at the stuccoed suburb of
Ashfield the medico, who took the floor,
dissected a heart (I) and “ explained the
inner workings of that organ in an interesting
manner!” But if he could have explained the
metaphysical ins and outs of the dead heart on the
table, instead of merely its gristly and gory inter-
E rotation, what a three-volume sensational novel
is scientific pow-wow would have turned to !
The ever-juvenile Bland Holt’s latest piece of
entertaining realism, “A Prodigal Daughter,”
wiled a large and fashionable dress-circle crowd
into Sydney Lyceum on Saturday. A society
theatre-party long-drawn-out (theatre-parties run
in all shapes—some are arranged in hollow squares,
while others are all shop-front, so to speak) was
strung round the front row like a string of beads,
and included a well-known belle in green velvet,
who had draped her pink cloak effectively, only
that the pinkiness and greenishness reminded me
of art-furniture.
Is it an English trick, the habit our superlatives
have of mobbing theatre-entrances on fashionable
first nights as if they were so many lady chamber-
lains watching to see if everybody’s bodice was
sufficiently ventilated to go in ? It is only women
who do this thing, mind you, and I want to beg
them for their own sakes to adopt some other
vantage-ground. To see a flock of women hanging
about the first landing of a theatre while every-
body else is going in looks like the foolish virgins
who turned up to find the S.R.O. board put out,
and it also casts a severe reflection, I think, on the
chivalry and punctuality of the society Johnny.
And there are even worse possibilities attached to
the habit. I hear that two rather flighty-looking
society ladies were doing the usual mysterious first
landing loiter at a Sydney theatre the other night
when they attracted the attention of a Melbourne
stockbroker who had dined unwisely enough to
make him press his escort upon them regardless of
chilling hauteur. But there was some excuse for
the poor man. He perhaps drunkenly mistook
them for a kind of angel who hangs about
Flemington waiting for somebody to smuggle her
in.
Almost the most prodigal thing in a “ Prodigal
Daughter ” was the generous display of heliotrope
hosen afforded by the fetching Henrietta Watson
in her flip-flop in the baccarat scene. If Miss W.
cannot swoon without letting her feet fly heaven-
wards like a bather when his life-buoy slips, she
should fill her little Booklets with duck-shot —a
precaution that leading ladies with more broom-
sticky understandings than the shapely Miss W.
probably never overlook. And I must also rise
and point out that not even Nellie Stewart’s
tricky pink calico slip, which the front stalls mis-
took for her cuticle, was so artful as Miss W.’s
pale-blue tea-gown contrasted with a fleshy colour
interpolated on the bodice in a manner that
made people grab their opera-glasses to see if
the dressmaker had blundered. But calm specu-
lation on this point was impossible in a realistio
whirl of pink-coats, cock-horses, brush-hurdles,
and general superlativeness —the only crude touch
in a wilderness of detail seeming to be the table-
decorations in the first scene, which were reminis-
cent of the showy hash-house where paper-poppies
with arsenic-green calico leaves blossom perenni-
ally on the coffee-stained table-cloth.
I think Mrs. Bland Holt, as Dorcas Gentle, is
about the strongest argument against the equality
of the sexes ever seen on the modern stage. The
whole house smiled when Dorcas came forth in a
check skirt, a fawn covert-coat, pot-hat, collar and
tie, and coolly put three “ monkeys ” on her fancy,
and every smile was a nail in the equality fad.
Then, when Dorcas, in a very ripping set-out of
pink and gold, joins airily in a bachelor baccarat-
party, it is borne in upon the unprejudiced
observer that woman can’t run a dead-heat with
her lord and master and look unimpeachably
respectable at the same time. Indeed, after the
following of the dainty Dorcas to her dreadful
end (in brown brocade and golden beads, with a
jaunty brown hat and feather and boutonniere of
primroses) as a talky Primrose dame, I came to
the conclusion that it isn’t safe for any woman to
model herself on the old man—unless he happens
to be a parson, or she happens to want to be mis-
taken for Mrs. Tanqueray.
The very latest effort of the Sydney Block
jewellers to scare up an ornament boom takes the
shape of the ‘‘Duchess of York brooch,” and I
really must say that of all the unkind reflections
on the—er—sentimental adaptability of her Grace
the Duchess, this little trinket of the moment is
the most suggestive. Read the description with-
out cynically smiling, if you can : It is a double
heart, the outer heart done in gold framework,
while inside depends a glass heart of all colours !
I am sure no ingrained loyalist would ever dream
of wearing it.
St. Vincent’s charity ball (the oldest public
dance left to Sydney now that the School o*
Industry ball has gone under) js to take place in
the Centennial Hall on Aug. 27, and a large
attendance is as much a certainty as that
the tail will follow the dog. And, talking of
charity balls, I hear from a Northern town that
feathers are flying over a hop in aid of the local
Nurses’ Horae. I gather, from information re-
ceived, that the superfine repp committee gave out
with each packet of tickets a list of those impos-
sibly vulgar persons to whom the vendors were on
no account to sell, and as the cards were cheap and
the &ite unplentiful, the unfortunate Nurses’
Home—the catspaw of cheap snobbery—is now
studying how to make itself bailiff-proof, as the
“ gate ” hardly came up to the exes.
By-the-way, it occurs to me in this connection
that the indigent charity in need of a leg up will
some day go back on the high-stepping, but
cheese-paring, female snob who gets a free family
ticket on the strength of talking through her nose
at committee-meetings and voting a guinea more
on to the Governoress’s bouquet. A day will
soon come, Horatio (or whoever you are), when
the Pure Merino, who travels on her visiting-list
as vigorously as Mr. Parkes travels on his old
age, will be voted out of the che-yair and some-
body less superfine and more philosophical hoisted
in her place. It is soothing to have Lady Dash
at the head of the list, but if her presence knocks
figures off the receipts on the eventful evening
conscientious charity committees won’t be able
to afford her.
I am in receipt of three alleged valses, the
“ Ooolgardie,” the “Quarabi” (it ought to be
called the Quisby !), and the “ Silver Moonlight.”
But, what has Australia done that this deluge of
inaccurate, tuneless waltz “ music ” should be
shot here? We are told, in various newspapers.
that N.S.W. is ahead of a lot of places m the
Trin. Coll, musical exams, held at Orne, and that
is probably the reason why we are deafened by
budding Beethovens, who Jglut the market with
shrill and feeble “waltzes” just because they
know enough of theory to keep three beats in a
bar ! Evidently f-time is the alphabet of musical
composition, for everybody begins with a waltz.
Heaven help us when they get more assurance
and begin to fill the country with fugues and Dead
Marches.
New music we have always with us nowadays
but one doesn’t often receive so promising a com-
position as the “Orescent” waltz, by Emile Lud-
low and dedicated to Essie Jenyns. The chief
motive is eccentric and original—-indeed the
whole waltz is more weird that pretty. Never-
theless it will take. In the same parcel with the
“ Crescent ” comes a comic song—though I don t
suppose the composer meant it to be considered
so. It is called “Pleasant Memories,” probably
because it would be so much more agreeable to
remember than actively listen to.
Yours affectionately, Sappho Smith.

If Luke, the evangelist, had only in-
serted a horse-race in his narrative of the son who
went and “blewed” his substance in a far
country, then his story and Bland Holt’s “ Pro-
digal Daughter ” would have been substantially
the same. Also, they would have had the same
moral, saving the fact that the old man of the
Scripture hadn’t been reconstructed during his
offspring’s absence, and so didn’t present a melan-
choly warning to boomers and speculators. The
Lyceum prodigal, who is represented by Miss
Henrietta Watson, is a maiden with an unaccount-
able love for a weak-looking person with a pale
face and flabby figure; and, like most of her kind,
she presently comes down to the husks, which
are Mr, Cosgrove, and the swine, which are Mr.
W. E. Baker. The swine, in this case, is a fine,
manly villain, who plays his part admirably;
while the husks are a dull and lamentable failure.
Miss Watson, who is an exceedingly nice girl and
deserves a better fate, flies with the flabby-looking
person because her father refuses to consent to
their marriage, and they live in splendid infamy
in a hotel until he goes broke and deserts her.
Then she waits patiently for his return, but as he
doesn’t return she goes back to her parent and is
forgiven, and the flabby one is forgiven, and Sass,
who hasn’t done anything, is forgiven, and every-
body is forgiven except Mr. Baker, who is cap-
tured by a policeman as he flies through the
garden gate.
# * *
This story fills three acts, and the other
two are occupied by sundry horse-scenes and the
most realistic steeplechase ever staged in Sydney.
The audience gets at least three times the usual
amount of horse for its money, for the steeple-
chasers tear furiously past the footlights on three
occasions. Also, two welshers are ducked by the
infuriated mob, and one jockey is killed. These
cheerful episodes make up for a multitude of sins,
and, as a matter of fact, there are less than the
usual number of melodramatic sins in the “ Pro-
digal Daughter.” The most glaring absurdity in
the whole proceeding is the spectacle of a lady of
Miss Watson’s physique and attractions wallowing
piteously at the feet of the weedy-looking person
aforementioned, and asking him not to leave
her. The exceeding perpendicularness of Sass,
who has never bent himself anywhere since Thk
Bulletin first knew him, is also somewhat
oppressive ; Sass, in the present case, makes love
in an absolutely straight line, and even in his
most impassioned moments he doesn’t deviate an
inch from his vertical attitude. Also, there is a
gruesome warning to persons about to marry in
the experiences of a flushed lord, personified by
Mr. Leopold, who marries a quiet little Quakeress,
which Quakeress is afterwards found dressed in a
loud-green check, and betting three monkeys on a
horse-race. This lady, represented by the pretty
Mrs. Bland Holt, is also extracted, with difficulty,
from a gambling-house, and takes to whooping in
a frightful manner at elections. Perhaps the most
unobtrusive feature of the play is the gentlemanly
manner in which the old man receives his lost
daughter without asking any questions ; and the
next most unobtrusive feature is Bland Holt him-
self, who is a stable-boy, and is principally occu-
pied in making good resolutions in the third act.
Miss Harrie Ireland has little to do, and does it
nicely, as is her wont, and a number of other per-
sons conduct themselves respectably.

The weepful story of “Uncle Tom’s Cabin
will be staged on Saturday at Her Majesty’s. I fc
is a considerable time since Sydney had a good
substantial weep, and as it is about due for
another, the persecuted African and the mournful
Eva, who is borne by paper angels to a mansion
in the skies, come in just where they are wanted.
Every effort is being made, in the way of scenery
and mechanical effects, to put on the poor, down-
trodden nigger in the most complete and artistic
fashion, and the horrors of cheap coloured labour
will stand out in the limelight with startling vivid-
ness.
The Shakespearian comedy at Sydney
Criterion gives up the struggle with adverse cir-
cumstances this week, and on Saturday an effort
will be made to improve the fortunes of the house
with Taylor’s “Unequal Match.” If the out-
raged ghost of the Divine Bill is not brooding
over the premises the attempt may be successful,
and as the bard has probably done Uie company
almost as much injury as he has received from it,
there is no visible reason why his apparition
should be present on the occasion.

Brough and Boucicault opened in Brisbane
with “The Sportsman,” by Lestocq, being the
very first performance thereof in Australia. It is
probably the only time in its history that the
dreary city on the mud flats has been favoured
with a “first performance” of the kind, and the
compliment resulted in great business. _ The
“sportsman,” represented by Cecil VVard, is the
samegood old beaming ass, who tells his wife that
he is going out for a day’s shooting, and then goes
on the tear, and finally returns with a decayed
Cochin China fowl as proof of his honafidcs. '1 lie
idea and the fowl are both old, but the treatment
is tolerably new. Every one has a reasonably
good partin the “Sportsman,” except Boucicault,
who is picked up and indignantly thrown away by
Mrs, Brough, and Miss Dudley, whose large,
frightened-looking eyes stare every one out of
countenance as a housemaid.
** * *
“Mr. Brough and Mr. Boucicault ” have
been playing to S.R.O. in all parts of Brisbane
Opera House, except the d.c. Twice during the
week Mr. B. and Mr. B. have been V.-R., and
have consequently had to play to chilly houses.
The average Brisbane pit is rowdy, but not this
time. On Thursday a row broke out during the
sanctuary scene in “The Village Priest,” and
Titheradge stopped short until dead silence pre-
vailed, following a burst of applause.

W. and M, have cancelled dates at Bris-
bane Royal in exchange for a season at the Opera
House in Sept. Bland Holt follows in October.
Maggie Moore has been turning money away at
Rockhampton and Townsville,
“ A King of Crime,” recently from Syd-
ney, is writing his name in blood upon the classic
boards of Melbourne Royal. The king now ap-
pears to be Charles Holloway, and the penalty of
interfering with plain Bill’s relative is a violent
decease. He is a doting husband, and a staunoli
friend to any right-minded burglar, but he’s rough
on rats who communicate with the police, and a
terror to misers who can’t bear parting with the
cash-box. All vermin of that sort the king chokes,
or otherwise extinguishes, in a highly popular
manner. Indeed, the King, regarded as a work of
dramatic literature, is sixteen times more immoral
than anything seized by the Government thus far,
not excepting Ovid’s “Art of Love.” Another
wicked idol of the masses is an unkempt hag, who
waves an abbreviated clothes-prop over the king’s
proceedings, as though she were a pantomime
fairy. This old remnant of iniquity is ably imper-
sonated by Miss Julia Merton, and the gallery
hails her as “ good old mother.” J. W. Sweeney
plays the comic mesmerist, who strikes venerable
Jimmy Cathcart stiff. Miss Maud Williamson
is a graceful blind wife to the sanguinary hero ;
and the other people are liberally placed upon the
stage. “ A King of Crime” will run till further
notice unless the Social Purity Society obtains an
injunction.
** * *
The last nights of “ Ma Mie Rosette,” at
the Princess’s, promise to linger for another week
or so. One visit to this unusual opera, the joint
offspring of many authors and librettists, excites
a warm desire to go again and enjoy it some more.
The voluptuous odour of Henri’s unhallowed
passion, intermingled with the sweet perfume of
Nellie Stewart’s pure rural love, is very intoxi-
cating. Figuratively speaking, no man has lived
until he has inhaled the fragrance of Nellie’s
naughty vision and gazed upon that timid flutter-
ing figure in the robe de nuit. For the ladies
of the audience there are Brownlow’s legs
arranged in a constant succession of amorous
(“ Sundry Shows' ’ continued on page 16.)
A gory joke is the King of Crime,
0, a gallery hero gay :
For he scrags a bloke from time to time
In a frank and honest way.
He rears his head in the limelight red ;
And the barrackers hold their breath
When he points a claw from his thieving paw
To bid the traitor, who broke his law,
Prepare for a midnight death,
For a horrible midnight death.
His Nibs, at the least, would scorn a lie —
Yea, a truthful fiend is he;
The trembling beast that he dooms to die
Has certainly got to dee.
Hark ! the midnight bell tolls forth his knell!
There’s blood on each rusty note ;
Two hands appear from an arbour near
And (merrily now the small boys cheer)
Lay hold of the traitor’s throat,
Of the gurgling traitor’s throat.
This murderous thief is slain, alas !
Yet he like a soldier falls ;
And he comes to grief as bold as brass.
Though riddled by rifle balls.
Then he flits from life to his dear, blind wife,
That deeply-lamented “ tart ”;
And angels sing as he plumes his wing—
“ Forgive the sins of the crimey King,
Because of his tender heart,
His deliciously tender ’art.”

Israel Mazey, one of the two survivors of
those who arrived in the ship Duke of York, the
first vessel to anchor in S.A. waters, died hut
month, aged 83. He was a member of the first
boat s crew that landed on Kangaroo Inland on
July 27, 183.6, five months before the earliest
Governor proclaimed the new province. One
Bates, who was living on the island before the
vessel arrived, is, however, still in the flesh.
Lord Kintore, who,
as a general thing, is

It was thought the estate of S.A. Agent-
General Bray would amount to a-quarter of a
million, and give back to the State in probate the
£15,000 received by deceased in official salary.
But Mr. Bray left little over £30,000.

N.S.W. Premier Dibbs’ fatal facility for

When Mannington Oaffyn was in Mel-

quite believe it.

Solicitor Meagher, of Sydney, has lately
defended, or instructed in the defence, of five
capitally-arraigned criminals. Archer was hanged,
Montgomery and Williams ditto, and now
Cummins and his mate, Lee, are to swing. But
nearly all were practically hopeless cases from the
first.
Bray has been more publicly wept for in
S.A. than any previously-deceased politician, but
many of the tears have been those of the parlia-
mentary crocodile, because it suited the purpose
of the enemies of the Government to make capital
out of the incidents surrounding his illness and
death.
Parkes : “ I remember, on one occasion,
when I had to address a large meeting at New

Queen.”
Wm. Kemp, the embezzling secretary of
Vic. Tender Board, goes to gaol for five years

straight for 25 years, and then sold himself for a
mess of pottage.
When the late Morgan Augustus M‘Don-

examine a witness watch his mouth as the old
Romans did. Good-bye ! ”
The deceased Victorian millionaire, Silas
Harding, did at least one memorable action in his
dreary, miserable, and utterly sordid existence.
Many years ago he got a judgment against a
railway company, and in satisfaction thereof
he seized the Geelong train as it was leaving
Spencer-street station full of passengers. His
later years were mostly spent in efforts to dodge
the land-tax, and with this end in view he made a
nominal transfer of a lot of valuable property to
sundry relatives. One of the relatives stuck to his
share of the property, and the Government made
Silas pay the tax all the same, so the miserable
old man was hit on both ears at once.

Last time a man named Robert Louis
Stevenson (who wears long hair and a velvet coat
and writes novels) visited Sydney, a hasty dinner
in his honour was got up in the Cosmopolitan
Club (now defunct, and no wonder). The Presi-
dent of the Club on that occasion delivered the
following speech : —“Gentlemen, it is arrived that
I have the honneur to propose the health—
naturally—of our guest, Mr. Robair Louis Steven-
son. When I was asked to take the chair I said
to my friend, ‘ But, good gracious, Ido not know
Mr. Stevenson.’ He said, ‘He write novels.’ I
went and ask&d for the novels, and I stopped up
last night to read one, absolutely. It was ver’
good. Truly I did not make to undairstand it all,
because it was in Scotch. But I think it is truly
very good very excellent. And therefore,
gentlemen, I ask you to drink with me, naturally,
the health of Mistair Stevenson now that I know
who he is.”
Because she has been silly enough to write
a book—a diary of half-formed opinions concern-
ing her travel-glimpses in N. America, Australia
and Maoriland—the Sydney dailies style the
Duchess of Buckingham and Chandos a “ dis-
tinguished visitor.” But the lady is not distin-
guished. She is only a swell tramp.
In Sydney, whenever a press-boss is at a
dinner or other “function,” the reporter finds it
necessary to include him in the list of “ eminent ”
or “ distinguished ” men present. Now, if a Melb.
reporter committed the gross indecency of men-
tioning the editor or owner of his paper as being
present at a gathering he would be looked on as
hopelessly incompetent.
Maoriland Premier Seddon at one time
kept a pub., and it is an open secret that even
now he has an interest in the same grog-mill. An
enemy of his relates that one evening, recently,
while the Premier dozed in the lobby, the affairs of
the house_(the public-house) seemed to come upper-
most in his mind, and he was heard to murmur, in
his dreams, “Charley, is the lamp all right? Don’t
give the new euchre-pack to that rough crowd in
the front room.”
The late John Bray, despite his good
nature, used to sit hard down on anybody who
interrupted his oratory. Once he was wading
through a long list of new Customs proposals
when a chronically-inebriated member demanded
to know, in a husky voice : “ What about tea ?”
“Tea,” said the beaming Johnny; “1 don’t
think the hon. member knows much about tea.
Wait till I get down among the W’s, and then
he’ll find something to interest him,”
A dead-beat waited upon the benevolent
and Herculean barrister Field, at the latter’s
chambers in Sydney, the other morning, with a
pitiful tale. The result was half-a-crown. Some-
thing in the man’s manner having aroused the
barrister’s^ suspicions, he followed him, and found
him dodging into the corner pub. With a hop,
step and jump the lawyer entered the bar, seized
the half-crown, which lay upon the counter, and
triumphantly returned to his chambers.
Boss Orangeman Simon Fraser (the “Aus-
tralian gentleman ” whose portrait was painted by
Millais), one of the trio representing Victoria at
Ottawa Conference, happened to travel to Rome
some years back in company with Martin Lough-
lin, who held influential letters of introduction to
the Vatican authorities, and showed his Orange
friend the religious grandeurs of the Eternal City.
Simon acted as a most devout pilgrim, and
reverentially kissed the hands of many cardinals.
The death of squatter George Melrose gave
the S.A. Treasurer .£15,000 in succession duty.
Had the estate not been divided among eight
children the duty would have been much larger,
as the progressive tax is collected upon individual
bequests, while wife, descendants, and ancestors
pay special rates. When the octogenarian mil-
lionaire Elder, G.C.M.G., dies, the State will reap
a harvest—say £BO,OOO. Mr. Elder is a bachelor,
and has no immediate relatives to come in cheap.
The late Judge “ Tommy ” Cope, of Mel-
bourne, had got into such a habit of writing short
pithy sentences in his note-book, that when he
wrote sketches or reminiscences (as he sometimes
did) the style was like “leaves from a Judge’s
note-book.” For instance (a verbatim transcript):
“ When I landed, in ’52, I took cheap lodgings at
Prahran. My boots were not cleaned for me, and
I couldn’t clean them myself. When I went out I
stepped into a puddle. They then looked as if I
had had a long walk.”
When the last Parkes Ministry resigned,
the old man sat in the N.S.W. Secretary’s office
awaiting the arrival of Dibbs—who, by the way,
didn’t turn up to ceremoniously see his predecessor
off the premises. While the ancient waited, a
gossip told him that Kidd was to succeed O’Con-
nor as Postmaster-General. “Ah,” said Parkes,
“Hi ham not surprised. It is very proper that a
Kidd should follow a Goat!” From which it is
plain that Parkes has a high opinion of politician
O'Connor, and is grateful for the gigantic slaver
performed by Daniel in naming the big Sydney
Post-office clock bell “ Great Parkes !”
Charles Wyndham, the “pretty,” though
clever London society actor, once, after much
solicitation, sent his autograph to a lady, now of
Sydney, who still possesses the “ Better late than
never.—Yours, Charles Wyndham,” forwarded
in answer to her gushing request. One night the
lady boasted of her prize to some young lady
friends, also Wyndham-gushers, and found that
he had sent the same charming, apparently-im-
promptu—but evidently stock—sentence “Better
late than never, etc.,” to them all. Amidst a
chorus of “ Did he send you the same, too,
dears?” it was admitted that the shock had
cured the whole pack of gushers. Not once in a
thousand times has a mummer any more origin-
ality than you find in the average chimpanzee.
The rapid though deserved promotion of
Charles Russell, Q.C., first as a Judge of Appeal,
and now to the position of Lord Chief Justice of
England, seems breathful of good luck. Though
perhaps a score of years ago, it appears like yester-
day to those who knew Russell when he was a
young, shy barrister, not overburdened with briefs,
and addicted to the wild recklessness of gambling
for such stakes as were within his means. A partial
parallel is perhaps found in the career of Mr.
Way, 0.J., and Lieut.-Governor of S.A. When
Sammy took to politics he was certainly a Q.C.,
but by no means a leader of the Bar in the popular
estimate. That was in Feb. ’75, and, in June
following, Premier Boucaut (now a Judge) made
him Attorney-General. About that time Judge
Wearing was drowned in the Gothenburg, but
Mr. Way didn’t snap at that vacancy. Not he !
He earned all-round commendations for his un-
selfishness in appointing to it Randolph Stow,
Q.C., the loader of the Adelaide Bar. On March
4th, ’76, Chief-Justice Hanson died, and Way
calmly appropriated his mantle. Probably
Boucaut could have done it, but he didn’t take it.
Then, Way being securely elevated for life, the
Boucaut Government came down smash three
months later. Boucaut became Premier again in
’77, and was glad to seek the haven of a pusine
Judgeship in ’7B—under his old subordinate and
junior at the Bar. Some men have great luck.
Shiels’ to-hell-with-the-Pope bimetallic
joke was magnanimously tolerated by the rev.
fathers, though some of the tender R.C. flock
writhed in the Melb. press. Shiels can never make
a speech without “ putting his foot in it.” Pro
testant though he is, he attended a recent lecture
given by Archbishop Walsh to a number of pious
Catholics, and in the course of a speech said :
“ Although I have not attained to the dignity of a
spiritual father I have, by good fortune and other
efforts, become the father of three children with
Irish names.”
HERE’S
THE “DIBBSOMANIAC.”
N.S.W. Premier Dibbs told the Bathurst
people that he had to give up business when he
entered Parliament. The words are neither more
nor less than those used by most men who have
made a permanent mark on the Parliamentary
history of their time. But what a clinching
argument they furnish in the present state of
controversy on the question of Payment of Mem-
bers ! If masters —and Dibbs and those who thus
spoke before him were employers of labour —were
compelled to surrender their businesses or abridge
their Legislative usefulness, how much greater is
this compulsion on the man who is merely in
another’s employment?
G. H. Reid is understood to have in view
for N.S.W. Treasurer, in his still-to-be-boru
administration, a politician who has not handled
figures in Parliament before. But, like Treas.
See, the person has kept shop and done a deal of
sharebroking. Anyway, Bruce Smith is out of it,
M'Millan won’t, it is said, be allowed to spend
more than a given amount of time away from his
warehouse, and confident little Burns is likely to
get plucked ; so that a fresh face in the Treasury
will be almost a necessity. Parkes was acting-
Treasurer twice in his long life, but only for a few
days on each occasion, and he says he won’t take
it.
John M‘Elhone’s relation to the N.S.W.
politics of the day may be thus briefly expressed :
“ When I went into Parliament before, I was as
strong as a bull and as mad as one. Let me in
again.” One good thing John did, however,
while in the House. A windy orator was one
night yelling on the floor a speech written Ly
somebody, which he had imperfectly committed
to memory, and had frequent recourse to the MS.
in his hind coat-pocket. When everybody was
sick and tired, but disallowed by the rules of the
House to throw an inkbottle or a ruler at the
orator, John slipped up behind (not like a bull
that time) and adroitly extracted the MS.
Half a minute after the orator broke down and an
afflicted audience thanked God.
Probably the most horrible example of
misplaced candour on record appeared in the S.M.
Herald last week. Speaking of the King divi-
sion of Sydney that paper said: “On the other
hand, there are in the same district . . . quite
a phenomenal number of pawnbrokers who, being
interested in unrestricted commerce, will probably
vote for the Freetrade candidate.” Of course the
three-ball artist will vote for Freetrade. Free-
trade produces poverty, and the Israelite whose
burnished nose looks out from beneath the gilded
arms of Lombardy, lives and moves and has his
monish by means of that same poverty. The
cause which receives the enthusiastic support of
the pawnbroking industry is always a thing to be
viewed with suspicion.
There appears to be a conspiracy between
the N.S.W. Opposition leaders and the Opposi-
tion daily press to regard “ Tom ” Slattery as a
great and masterful genius for intrigue, as the
mysterious power behind the throne in N.S.W.,
and the secret of Dibbs’ greatness. This is a very
good fiction for stage and election purposes, but
would hardly gain credence in any community in
which there was not a section which welcomed a
sectarian scare as part of its political life-breath.
Being merely a commonplace man, without those
large esoteric powers, Slattery is known to be
immensely flattered by the rumours of his remark-
able doings, which are whispered in awful whispers
in the trembling editorial ear. It became known
afterwards to David Gopperfield that the “in-
exorable Mr. Jorkins ” was a mild, little man,
whose terrible reputation was a fiction of his
partner, Mr. Spenlow ; Tom, of Burrowa, is
the Jorkins of N.S.W. politics.

One of the
few remarkable
things about that
uninteresting de-
funct politician,
D. M. Davies, of
Victoria, was the
eulogy which
Shiels pronounced
over his dust in
the Assembly.
The long, thin
man was in a
desolate mood and
wailed consider-
ably concerning
things in general.
“Counting up its
moments of plea-
sure against its
daysof darkness,”
he said ; “ reckon -
in g its joys
against its sor-
rows, no man of
sense would vol-
untarily launch
his own harque
upon the sea of
this life.” Which
is a long and de-
pressed way of
saying that Shiels
is sorry he was
ever born. His
creed is practi-
cally this: it is
good to be; it is
better to cease
from being; it is
best of all never
to have been. But
Shiels doesn’t sui-
cide, all the same,
and whoever kills
him will have to
climb over his
dead body to do it.
The man who tries

fessional pessimist

Although there are six Labour-inember 8

South Australia has, for over 30 years,

The anti-bribery clauses of N.S. Wales

The chief feature of next week’s N.S.W.
elections will be the prevalence of voting accord-
ing to dictation. Labour started the idea, and it
has been imitated by both the protectionists and
foreign-raiders. The wrath of some of the un-
selected candidates is fearful to behold, and most
of them will take their revenge out by going to
the poll and splitting the vote of their own party.
0. F. Langier, Enfield, Vic., has hatched

have polled over one-third of the votes registered

limited time, and to cast a vote of the relative
value of the electoral power represented by them.

tentacles —whence the stock-tax ; and goes on to
hint that more than one member of the “ six
families” is directly benefited by the Govt, rail-
way from Southern Cross to Northam, completed,
working, paying and—left in the contractor’s
hands till September next.
At the capitalistic meeting in Sydney Cen-
tenary Hall, last week, one speaker claimed that
the province was his debtor because he had
had 22 children born in it, and all still
alive. At that meeting, by the way, ad-
mission was on ticket. Yet Teetotal - lecturer
Isitt had said in the same hall a few days before,
“It must be a bad cause that can't trust itself to
the people.” Appropriately enough, the fat
policeman who does duty at N.S.W. Legislative
Assembly kept the outer door.
Though the Australian Natives Association
in Adelaide languishes and looks like death,
natives themselves are in the ascendancy in
local politics. The President and Chairman
of Committees in the Legislative Council
are both South Australians, while the Speaker,
the Premier, the Treasurer, the Commissioner of
Crown Lands, the Government Whip, and the
Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly also
claim this continent as their birth-place.
The latest N.S. W. Electoral Act provide B
that every candidate for Parliament must possess
an elector’s right, and must personally sign the
nomination paper. On account of his being dis-
qualified as to both these requirements, by reason
of absence in England, Tiger Inglis, by his local
agent, has withdrawn his candidature for Armi-
dale. If Inglis is thus disqualified, what about
Minister Suttor, who is at present in Canada?
Did he sign his nomination-paper in advance?
The Vic. Civil Service Association has the
folly to issue a pronunciamento to the effect that
the members will not submit to further reductions,
but, of course, everyone knows they will. Let
them strike, and see how many thousands of men,
of equal ability, are ready to replace them at half
the figure. The former fulmination of the Service
on the eve of the general election, in a circular to
the candidates, threatening them with the power
of 30,000 votes, had the same effect as R.O. Arch-
bishop Gould’s Pastoral before the Education Act.
Shiels, as Premier, was furious when he found it
out, and there were dire things to be done, but the
specific offenders could never be traced.
Specimen of heckling as done in Banana-
land on the unfortunate capitalistic M.L. A. ques-
tion ; “Are you in favour of one-man-one-vote ?”
M.L.A. : “No! not just at present.” (Howl of
indignation from the audience). “Do you believe
in Socialism in our time?” M.L. A. (timorously):
“Well —No not quite.” (Terrific uproar).
“ Will you, if allowed, make a present of your
150-acre paddock, just outside the town, to" the
municipality, provided it be christened Eat Man’s
Park?” M.L. A., eagerly, “O, certainly; with
pleasure.” And the free and independent dis-
perse, richer by a public park, to get their names
on the roll, and be prepared to vote to a man for
he Labour candidate at the next election.
The commonest gibe against ex-Labour-
members is : “What about that .£3OO a year?”
Coining as it does from men who can only bo
represented while payment of members lasts, this
is a strange proof that the feeling against the man
who draws the salary is always intensified when
he is poor, and mitigated when he is rich. To
him who has much, more is not begrudged.
The S.M. Herald sees in Parkes’s elec-
tioneering addresses “an element of pathos as
well as an air of dignity.” E.g. : Rattled by an
obnoxious question, Parkes exclaimed from the
platform—“Hi ham, hinformed that ha hinmate
hescaped from Gladesville Asylum this morning.”
Parkes relied on the ladies he had stuffed into the
gallery to restrain his audience from violent
phases of rudeness.
Queensland Op-
position leader
Powers lias issued
an address to bush-
workers almost dupli-
cating arecentßuLLE-
TlN article, and insist-
ing stronerly on the
folly of strikes.
Maoriland still
heads th e Austra-
lasian democratic pro-
cession. With the
aid of the Labour
majority, Premier
Seddon proposes ■'to
bring in a bill I to
doulile the poll-tax
on Chinese, and to
place similar capita-
tion restrictions on
Syrians, Afghans,
and other coloured
peoples. Known
criminal immigrants
will be prohibited
from landing at any
price. Shipowners
whose vessels carry
paupers or imbeciles,
&c., t o Maoriland
will be liable to penal-
ties, thus copying the
American law in some
of its practical de-
tails. Meanwhile the
Victorian authorities
are welcoming Chows
with a paternal gush,
born, apparently, of
a big chasm in the
Treasury. And New
South Wales lets the
Chinese smuggle him-
self into its territory
with a vacant and
unseeing eye. Port
Darwin (N.T.) is the
back-door which sup-
plies Queensland, and
eventually the whole
continent, with cara-
vans of the yellow
man. AndtheGovern-
ment of West Aus-
tralia takes off its
hat to every fresh,
“cheap, and reliable”
coloured brudder.
One result of female suffrage in Mam iland
has been the abolition—by 27 votes to 24 of the
sale of grog in the refreshment-room of the Hons ?
of Representatives. The motion was at first
scoffed at as a joke, and as only 51 votes weie
recorded, it may yet be rescinded. Meanwhile,
the “ pocket-pistol ” will become a prized institu-
tion in the legislative halls of Maoriland.
“ Mishter Shpeaker ” —produces pocket-pistol—
“er, I rise to, er ” —gurgle, gurgle, gurgle, gluck !
Leaders of old political parties in Queens-
land call him a good party man who, on all
occasions when ordered by his chief, votes to turn
the other side out of office; but all these old
politicians contend that it is the duty of fail our
members to vote only as their consciences dictate,
and that when they subordinate the merits of any
question to instructions from another, they piove
their unfitness for responsible jtositions. The
Bulletin for years has advocated the abolition of
Party Government.
Now that a new set of N.S.W. Labour-
members has almost pushed out the former crowd,
it must be about time to organise the set which
will, in the course of nature, push them out. How
many times will Labour change its seasoned
political leather for the raw greenhide before it
tumbles to the lunacy of the thing? During the
Commune in Paris, the old executive was regu-
larly taken out and shot before breakfast every
morning, while the new executive swaggered
about for the ensuing 24 hours. And yet the
Commune was a failure !
The Bulletin in advance declines with
malice aforethought to recognise the next N.S.W.
Parliament—which will probably be elected by
one-third or less of the voters —as representing
anybody or anything definite or special. There
are an incalculable number of issues, a multiplicity
of parties, a superfluity of programmes, and a per-
fect maelstrom generally. The 6nly hopeful
possibility seems to be that immediately after the
election both Parkes and Dibbs will be “ elevated”
to the Legislative Council dustbin.
Sydney D.T., and the Reid and M‘Millan
school of politicians, base their electioneering
attitudes on the assumption that the people of
N.S. Wales form “ a province of freetraders, who
have had protection forced upon them by a com-
bination of accident and treachery.” Any para-
dqx is provable if the pretended logician starts
with an artificial and false assumption, and this
freetrade lie is as magnitudinous in its way as is
the Anglo-Saxon orthodoxy that John Bull is
the salt of the earth, the light of the; heathen,
the boss of all nations, the rightful possessor of
the planet, the mortgagee of Heaven, and the
favourite son of God.

At the request of some of the clergy, Dean
Cowper has prepared the accompanying form
of prayer, to he used in divine service In An-
glican Churches from to-morrow until the
close of the'elections:—“Almighty God, who
by Thy divine Providence ordereth all things
both in heaven and earth, and hast taught
us in Thy holy word that by righteousness
nations prosper, we humbly beseech Thee so
to influence the minds of the people of this,
colony at the present time, that they may
choose as legislators meu who fear Thee, who
love truth and do righteously. Grant this,
we beseech Thee, for the sake of Jesps .Christ,:
our Lord. . Atoen.”
Can Sir Henry Parkes or anybody ©lse
reconcile these utterances, extracted trom
,Sir Henry’s speech at St. Leonards
“It was impossible to sink the fiscal issiie
without sinking their principles and sinking
their manhood.”
“ This wretched squabble about freetrade
and protection.”
< *VHje was quite willing to let that question
(the fiscal question) rest, pending the coming
together of these colonies in pnion, providing
others were willing to let it rest.”
“The present tariff, which they otfed o
the Dibbs Ministry, was so charged with
mischief and injustice that he was inclined
j to think that a portion of the duties ought to
I be repealed on the ground of their very ab-
surdity.'’
“ He was, however, quite willing to let
this question., so far as it was one of prin-
ciple, rest ”

A damp family grave tells no tales after a
time. Substantial coffins with adult corpse en-
closed have been known to disappear amidst the
moisture of 20 years, leaving no trace of the in-
terment save a little ball of human Lair powdered
with wood-dust. Had the late Mr. Needle and
his two children found rest in a low-lying spot at
Booroondara (Melb.) cemetery it would have
seemed almost useless to exhume their bodies,
since arsenic, though indestructible, is soluble in
water. Presuming that there was any poison in
them once, it would, in all probability, have been
washed away ere now from their rapidly vanish-
ing remains. ■ It appears, however, that they were
deposited in a very high and dry place, therefore
analyst Blackett expects to find arsenic, if any
existed in them at time of burial. An evident
moral is pointed by these particulars. When an
elderly gentleman purchases a young and amorous
wife he should invest in a well-drained grave-plot
at the same time, nor forget to impress upon his
spouse the advantages of a dry bed in suspicious
cases. Better still to build a vault and direct his
coffin to be placed on the top shelf, for any
ordinary grave, after all, is at the mercy of a
watering-pot. When you see a buxom widow
pouring quarts of water over a sandy allotment
she may be ministering to the shrubs and flowers,
but she also may be doing her level best to disWve
the arsenic below. A vault is safest.

On the occasion of the visit of the
Bacchante to Melb., in 1881, one gleeful and
grammarless groveller sent a couple of gilt-edged
superfine invitations to the “young princes” to
attend a dinner-party at his private house. An
acceptance came in due course, and the slobber-
some one travelled round to all his friends in a
semi-hysterical condition spreading the glad
tidings, and finally brought up at a furniture-shop
where he ordered, regardless of expense, two
ormulu and gold-framed chairs with red plush
backs and the Royal arms emblazoned in seven
colours. But, 10, when the time arrived, no
princes turned up, and the solitary second-class
aide-de-camp, who rolled in at half-past nine, ex-
plained, haughtily, in reply to enquiries, that it
was etiquette for Royalty always to accept. Then
he raised his single eye-glass, and glancing round,
muttered that the whole show was a “ ter-
rible boah,” and left. The host’s loyalty has
somewhat decreased since that date, and two
shrieking theatrical unsaleable chairs, stowed
away in a lumber-room, are about all that remain
of that intangible virtue at the present day.
“A.B.C.,”the

ist of the Sydney

ald, enquires
why people don’t
club together and
“ keep a cow ”
for their own use,
instead of paying
through the nose
to middlemen for
milk? Which,
being interpreted,
may be taken as
an enquiry why
it is that the Her-
ald proprietary
buy all their stories
for use in the
Sydney Mail
from middlemen
syndicates instead
of from the ant hors
direct —or, to put
the matter closely,
why they don’t
keep a cow of their
own ?

It is related
that a certain big
N.S.W. squatter
lately sent out a
lot of sheep to be
boiled down. Thv
morning after de-
livery he rode
over three miles
with about 21b. of
fat (worth about
and placed it
carefully in the
digester. His wife
had put it away
for household pur-
poses ; but he ex-
plained that “ it’ll
only be wasted up
at the house;
these women are
so awful extrava-
gant !”
Rev. Evans, of Middle Park, Melb., has
been preaching in praise of billiards. “ Why not
have billiard-tables in the home,” lie asks, where
the fathers and sons can play without the evil
associations that usually accompany the game '
Why not have a ballet in the drawing-room, also
linker parties-for buttons—and combats between
Bandy Mick and the Brighton Bantam? We
don’t know, only that men, fathers and sons don t
care a Fink for these things without the alleged
“evil associations.” “Evil associations,’ alas,
are the salt of life.

This is the Book of Genesis in leprosy as

Act II. —The aboriginal, touched with com-

camp, and taketh him in (fricasseed). Act 111. —
A horde of leprous aboriginals rot piecemeal by the

Bishop Dawes, of Rockhampton, tells the

a lady parishioner of the Anglican church in the

the necessary particulars in writing, she_ came
to the heading, “condition” (widow or single).

There is one consolation in re the appar-
ently causeless suicide last week of a bright and
seemingly happy N.S.W. girl. By being success-
ful, she escaped the indignity of being haled
before a magistrate, and probably of being sent to
gaol for a mouth for failing to complete the act.
Which prc >ves, as have millions of events, that
there is no bad situation that might not be worse.
There is a difficulty about hanging Lee and
Cummins together, the gallows at Tamworth
(N.S. W.) gaol being only constructed to accommo-
date one patient at a time. So the authorities
propose to strangulate Lee at 8 a. m. and Cummins
an hour later. In this emergency, the writer
offers a patent suggestion to the public execu-
tioner : “Put them back to back; strap them closely
together ; then a swingle-tree arrangement over-
head with two nooses, and—thawp ! ” “ Horribly
brutal,” say you ? Well, not a whit more brutal
than the ceremonious ordinary ..angiug. When

you are doing a hideous job, you might as well
surround it with trimmings. Besides, if you
asked ’em, you’d perhaps find that Lee and Cum-
mins, being mates in iniquity, would sooner “ go
out ” together.

The true story of the hanging of Mrs.
Knorr, and of the period between the passing of
sentence and the execution thereof, has yet to be
told. It will be an eloquent commentary on the
capital punishment system.

Now that the Apostles of Pruriency have
scented out the classics ic will be interesting to
see where they will stop. There is hardly an
ancient author-and the adjective may embrace
all writers prior to the year 1800 —in whose works
some cobalt passages do not appear. When the
second-hand book-shops are weeded and generally
“ prurified,” the Melb. Public Library —it has
already withdrawn from circulation Hawthorne's
“ Scarlet Letter ” ! ! !—will probably receive att'en-
tion. Indeed, it is hard to see how a Government
which forbids Ovid’s “ Art of Love ” to be
privately sold, can continue to permit the work
—and others which, viewed from the same stand-
point, are even worse—to be handled by the public.
There are several editions of Dryden’s famous
translation in the Lending Branch of the Vic.
Public Library, and, since attention has been
directed to it, all of them have been asked for
and issued, so that for the first time on record
there has been a run on the book, and many
applicants have been disappointed. One of the
editions, by the way, bears on its calf cover the
inscription : “ Presented to the Public Library
by His Excellency Sir H. Barkly, K.C.B., 3rd
August, 1863.” What a wicked Governor ! Mean-
time, there is a classic boom in Smellbourne, and
Longus, Theocritus, Lucretius, Ovid, and other
gay old dogs, have for the time, being eclipsed
Sarah Grand, Mrs. Mannington Caffyn. and the
rest of the modern straight out school. It is
another singular inconsistency that while Zola has
been ostracised by the Vic. Customs Department,
“Rabelais,” “ Boccacio,’'etc., are openly offered
for sale, while indisputably obscene prints are
circulated unchecked,

Editor Bulletin, — You are wrong about
four charitable institutions in Sydney carrying on
operations without reference to each other. Bene-
volent Asylum and Labour Bureau work into
each other’s hand. Former only gives relief in
cases latter will not entertain. When a husband
is able to work he is sent to the Labour Bureau.
If he is sent into the country fossicking, the wife
has to go to the Benevolent Asylum. In no case is
the relief given sufficient to keep the family with-
out work or further help. It only consists of food
and a few shillings towards the rent—no fuel,
candle, or soap—and the rent-receipt must be
given up.—R.

The shabby-genteel petition to Chief Jus-
tice Way (S.A.) praying that publication of
the “immoral details” of a fashionable divorce-
case might be prohibited, again illustrates
the “ society ” creed that the penalties and odium

An Australian police-officer lately had a
little domestic difficulty vvitli his better-half. She
was under the imprecision that hubby was too
friendly with another woman, and conceived the
brilliant notion of reporting him to head-
quarters. To her consternation the officer lost a
stripe and with it a certain amount of pay.
Jealousy sometimes crushes a poor dividend.

When the W.C.T.U. in-
terviewed the Vic. Minister of
Customs to demand the sup-
pression of “indecent litera-
ture,” these skinny saints
handed in a list of the bad
books to which they especially
desired to draw attention. The
Bulletin couldn’t have done
that if it tried ; it doesn’t know
enough indecent books to make
any sort of list worth speaking
about. It is only the W.C.T.U.
and Y.M.C.A. and Y.W.O.A.
saints who know all the inde-
cent books, and know exactly
how indecent they are. And,
considering that one person of
average memory can only keep
a mental grip of a certain num-
ber of books, the saint who
knows so many indecent books
can hardly have time to know
any decent ones.

That beneficent institu-
tion, the Melb. Charity Organ-
isation Society, . was heard
from, the other day, in the
local police-court. Some little
time ago the society took com-
passion on an unemployed
carter, and bought him a horse,
so that he might earn a living
for self and family. The cash
value of this shattered equine
was about 55., and it was so old
and feeble and forlorn that
when the recipient was found
driving it the police ran him in
and had him fined £2 for
cruelty. The wretched animal
was killed and given to the
lions at the Zoo. As for the
carter, he is 40s. worse off than
he was before the society came
to his assistance, and his posi-
tion is another awful commen-
tary on the ingratitude of the
lower orders.
Thus a correspondent:—
UuijjKTiK,— Apropos the divided skirt: The liark
view of a woman in baggy pants is as handsome as the
baok view of an elephant.
If the Lord designed woman for trousers, how is it she
looks so huge a joke in them ?
Providence gave woman a head to hide her body, but
the woman who wears trousers shows no head—only body.
Woman in dress often looks a triumph of Art over
Nature: the woman in trousers looks a triumph of Nature
over Art. “Now, most women,’’ remarks the anatomist
Velpeau, “look much better when dressed than when
undressed.” Trousers are a step in the direction of being
undressed.
There are three things which pass our understanding—
The love of a woman, her cruelty: and why she should
ever want to wear trousers.
For trousers on a woman are as out of place as the blue-
ribbon on a cabman.
And a woman in trousers loses even the virtue of a bad
egg, for that has a good exterior.
Man can admire the nobleness of woman’s soul and the
lace on her petticoat; What man could admire the noble-
ness of woman’s soul and the bagginess of her trousers?
Now, abide these four tilings which a good woman may
not give: Her Religion, her Honour, her Lover, her
Petticoat. And the greatest of these is the Petticoat.

The alleged humour of the police-court
bench is a coarse and ghoul-like affair. A fine
specimen of it turned up last week at South Mel-
bourne. A sad-looking, thin, shabby-genteel man,
with an infant in his arms and a child toddling by
his side, appeared to ask for advice. His wife, he
said, had left him. He had five children, the two
infants there in evidence and three other small
youngsters ; and having no female relatives to
look after them, he was compelled to stay at home
and mind the family himself, and was thus pre-
cluded from earning a livelihood as a wharf-
labourer. He had no means of paying for legal
advice, so he asked the bench to advise him as to
the steps necessary for compelling his wife to
return. Then the bench opened its mouth till the
stopping in its back tooth was plainly visible, and
guffawed at the poor, broken-down applicant, and
advised him to “get a good-looking young woman
in to mind the children,’’ and when she heard of
it the lost wife would probably return. Upon
which truly Solomonic deliverance the audience
all yelled with laughter, and the seedy husband,
seeing that something of the kind was evidently
expected of him, smiled feebly and went away.

DOMESTIC ECONOMY!
WHA.T IS XT ?
DOMESTIC ECONOMY is primarily the art of feeding and clothing the family at as low a rate as possible,
without impairing the family digestion, or taking away the character of its members for being well and com-
fortably dressed. Domestic economy is not comprised in buying a bad article for sixpence when better can be
got for sevenpence ; but if the ruling price for the best is eightpence, and somebody comes along and offers it for
sevenpence, then it’s domestic economy to close with the merchant so offering. By all means study this great
and glorious science of social life, because its due and proper observance cannot fail to make poor people rich, and
rich ones richer. What say you? Will you do your business at
?

How to Get a Piano or Organ.
VOU, of course, want the highest quality of tone, action,
touch and beauty of exterior you can afford; but
you must have DURABILITY. Durability is an indispensable
condition, and however cheap an instrument may appear,
without durability it is worthless. Avoid the cheap
pianos, for which there are agents in every town, who tell
—and often through ignorance believe—that they are
equal to the Steinway or the Erard or some other tirst-
class maker. Therefore, no matter how big a bargain you
think somebody else offers, investigate

Dear Bulletin, —Enough of the mean
man; let me start a “ tight place ” series. Has
any reader been in a worse hole than this of mine ?
Seven years ago I called on the manager of
to inspect a mob of rams. The glass was well past
the 100 in the shade, and my host suggested a
bath before dinner, “ I always go in for a plunge
at this time,” said he, “as I find it gives one a
first-rate appetite.” The water was cool and re-
freshing, and I lay long enjoying it. Suddenly
the dinner-bell sounded and I jumped out, applied
a rough towel, and started to dress. My shirt
caught round my head, and before I could disen-
tangle myself—Presto! the door burst open, and a
lady rushed in and folded me in her arms, shout-
ing, “Dick, you stupid, when will you be ready
for dinner ?” She did not appear that evening.—

Some dull people persist in regarding Max
Adeler’s “Out of the Hurly-Burly ” as a work of
the imagination. Here is a solemn extract from
the correspondence column of Sydney Mail
(weekly edition of the right-thinking Sydney
Morning Herald), sandwiched in between an
item about bushrangers and an answer to a person
in search of a soap-recipe:—
E.G. (Camden): 1. Yes, it is believed by those who
study the Scriptures that the Millennium (which it is sup-
posed you mean when you refer to the “ end of the
world ’’) is not very far off. We are living in the last
days, but how far off the second coming of our Saviour is,
cannot be stated. The signs of the times will be the best
guide, and when you find that the Gospel has been
preached to all nations (not that the world has been con-
verted), and when the Jews are restored to Palestine,
then the second advent of our Saviour will take place,
and those who have died in Him will rise from their graves
to meet Him in the air, and then they will reign over the
earth for 1000 years. The rest of the dead will remain in
their graves until the second resurrection. Many of the
prophesies in the Bible have been fulfilled, but some of
them have still to be accomplished. 2. You want to
know, how an intelligent person may know whether he
has “ heart disease ?” The best way to find out is to get
sounded by an intelligent physician, who will perhaps
point out to you that people sometimes mistake indiges-
tion for heart disease, and that people sometimes have
heart disease without being aware of it, and consequently
are likely to drop dead at any moment. The remainder
of your question will be answered elsewhere. See the
“ Agricultural Column.”
Which—and especially the fact that the rest of
the answers will be found in the “ Agricultural
Column ” —is about the strangest mixture of the
practical and fanciful that can well be imagined.
Why the Millennium wasn’t also put in the “ Agri-
cultural Column ” is a mystery.

Dr. Chas. M‘oarbhy, of Sydney, testifies,
in a Melb. paper, to the wonderful powers of a
certain lady-medium. She can materialise little
Josephines and Cissies and other fashionable
spirits without going into a cabinet to do it. “ I
have frequently,” says the confiding medical man,
“seen with my ordinary sight this medium and a
materialised form out (of the cabinet) together,
have spoken to both of them, and have found the
form to be as real, warm, animated flesh and blood
as the medium herself.” The unconscious humour
of a sperrit-worshipper is very touching. Dr. M.
believes in the mystic genuineness of a plump form
that he can pinch, and he believes also that he has
photographed a half-formed entity in process of
materialisation—“ which appears as a vaporous,
though shapely, mass.” The vulgar question as
to why he didn’t keep his camera fixed upon
the process, and obtain photos, of the entity
in every stage of development seemingly doesn’t
trouble Dr. M’Oarthy. He has “ taken ” a
mass of luminous vapour, and pinched a warm
flesh and blood form, and the intervening evolu-
tion he takes for granted. There is a showman in
Melbourne who can produce more spirits and
accomplish more eerie things in a strange room
than Dr. M’Carthy’s medium would dare attempt.
Consequently the whole gang of local spiritualists
have tried, at one time or other, to convince the
aforesaid trickster (who is, or was, a compositor in
private life) that he possessed supernatural powers
without being aware of the fact. He lacks,
however, the peculiar power to humbug himself,
and so the soulless creature continues to call him-
self an entertainer. For a respectable fee he
would, no doubt, be happy to give Dr. M’Carthy
plenty of luminous entity and a fine materialised
barmaid form, and even teach the scientist how to
work the process himself.

How is it that Chinamen hawk fish in

At a recent meeting of a Yic. Australian
Natives’ Society, the exercise of the evening was
impromptu speaking, and the theme allotted to
the unfortunate president was “ Chinese Meta-
physics.” But he grasped it manfully. Prefacing
his remarks by regretting that ho knew little of
the subject—he relieved himself of the following :
“I have no faith in them at all, gentlemen. I
believe there are a few in Melbourne, but I have
never heard of them being successful. I know
this, that if I was sick, I would die before I would
submit myself to a Chinese doctor .” Australia for

The other Sunday a suburban (Sydney)
omnibus was coming into town at a good pace.
Presently it clattered past a church, and a man on
the box-seat remonstrated with the driver.
“Isn’t there a regulation about going slow when
you pass a church while service is on so as not to
disturb the congregation ? ” “I b’lieve there is,”
said the driver meditatively, “ but that place don’t
matter. That's only a Wesleyan Church.” And
he addressed some strong language to the front

A Maorilander has invented a new way of
getting round the miserable publican. This person
stayed a good many weeks at a hotel in a Southern
town and paid nothing; even his drinks were put
in the bill. When the score got up to .£l2 or so
he attempted to get away with his luggage, but
the landlord seized the “ props.” as security, and
retained them, despite sundry desperate efforts on
the part of the ejected lodger to recover posses-
sion. Then the lodger had an inspiration. He
got a friend to take out a summons against the
publican for damage to an alleged fence, and
subpoenaed all the family as witnesses. When
the case came on they all went to court in pro-
cession, leaving the bar in charge of a stranger.
and when they returned an hour later —there
having been no appearance of the prosecutor—the
luggage was gone. A man had called round,
stating that the landlord sent him for the boxes,
and the amateur barman gave them up without
the slightest suspicion. The scene closes with an
infuriated publican prancing in the bar, and using
language of the kind that is generally written out
and handed up to the magistrate.

The most thriving trade, just at present,
is that of the signwriter. As with the pawn-
broker and the bailiff's, the measure of the sign-
writer’s briskness is that of the community’s
depression. Everyone who has, or can borrow, a
few pounds opens some kind of shop these hard
times, in the desperate struggle to stave off star-
vation. A sign-writer is engaged to paint the
name over the door, and, with all its stock-
in-trade in the window, the little shop makes a
good show—for a month or so. Then it closes
up in a hurry. These is never anything to
prepare one for this contingency. _ No notice of
sale “owing to the proprietor retiring from busi-
ness,” or that he is “moving to larger and more
commodious premises.” The shop is simply
opened to-day and to-morrow it isn’t. That is
all. Anon thereduced rent ” tempts some other
unfortunate ; the same old sign-writer comes along
with his ladders and demolishes his late work,
and in its place paints the name of the new
tenant. Again the shop is opened, and, in a little
while, closed. No one ever buys anything in
these little shops ; yet, if the stock is edible, it
grows beautifully less as time goes by. The pro-
prietor, poor devil, must live on it; and when
at length he has eaten himself out and been
moved on, someone is always ready to take bis
place and “keep shop.” And the only one to
reap any benefit out of all this opening and closing
is the sign-writer—if he gets paid.

The worldliness of professional church
singing receives bold advt. in Melbourne of late
from the performances of a certain “St. Paul’s
Cathedral quartette party.” These salaried mem-
bers of the holy choir accept society engagements
to go around o’ nights and sing glees, which, by
the way, they do uncommonly well. There is just
a faint odour of sanctity about warblers who have
been joining in the anthem swell only a short
time previous, so the more serious-minded portion
of the community derives comfort as well as joy
from their secular music. Even the host, who
cashes up the fees, feels like cue who is lending to
; the Lord, and coughs dubiously before suggesting
drinks to the quartette.
A similar spiritual something is credited to the
personality of Ernest Wood, the gifted young
organist at St. Paul’s, A while ago, when
Sterling wanted the best available talent to mani-
pulate the Town Hall organ for her “Lost
Chord,” the old lady’s manager, waiting upon the
Cathedral artist, was staggered to find him a
highly-groomed and tailored genius, vvitli a waxy
moustache, and proud, commercial spirit. The
showman had expected to ‘strike a mild, long-
haired person of the Tom Pinch type, who would
come and play for nothing to oblige a hoarse
female in distress. His account of the disillusion-
ment was quite pathetic.

Editor Bulletin, —Where is the use of
whining about the political prominence of new-
chums in N.S. Wales ? Don’t you know that, in
Sydney, new-chums are regarded as the salt of the
earth, and they can get their pick of the best
billets going, at the highest rate of pay, and
almost without credentials, while men of proved
ability and established character are walking about
unable to get employment ? The man fresh from
Hingland is preferred even for positions that
demand special local experience, and he is indul-
gently allowed to go on for months bungling and
muddling in a way that would qualify an old-chum
for the noble order of the sack in a week.— Old-

Fitz Gibbon, the one and only, suggests a
delicate improvement in the arrangements at Port
Phillip quarantine station. When women are
detained, there should, says gallant Fitz., be a
female attendant to disinfect their garments,
instead of a male creature who gathers up the
mysteries of beauty’s toilet, and probably criti-
cises the lace trimmings and things in secret.
Fitz Gibbon is right. Women there are who would
die rather than “hand over their garments, to a
male attendant.” The harp, if you please :

And with the servants stand 1
Black soot upon my forehead
And coat-dust on my hand ;
Or polish knives and carvers

And wake the noise of saucepans
From morning until night.
And when hot winds are blowing
Across the sandy street,
How sweet to take my dinner
In burning kitchen heat!
How sweet to get up early
And grind away all day,
To wait upon the children
And wait nix months tor pay 1
Oh, yes, I’ll be a servant
And with the servants stand }
No curls to grace my forehead.
Fierce redness on my hand ;
One evening out in seven,
And Sundays, one in four,
No followers or sweethearts,
If otherwise—the door 1

Her what’s-its-name and so-and-so
Were wanted at the “station.”
When told to “ change ” in hottest haste
Her gown and vestments, white and chaste.

Did never dream her sex must bear
The shame of handing underwear
To, ugh! a male attendant.

Smiting hard her bony chest
She drove the bonnet-pin in,
The weapon struck a vital place,

Ah ! death was better than the shame
Of handing up her what’s-its-name
To anyone in breeches.


Parliamentary Elections.
MAIXTIFUBTO
—OF—
The Central Election Committee of
the Protectionist Party.
To THE
Electors of New South Wales.
We earnestly ask you to consider the follow-
ing facts in connection with this Election
Under the influence and rule of the Foreign
Trade Party we have piled up a debt to
foreign countries of £55,000,000, for which
we have to pay two and a-quarter millions
interest out of our produce.
The expenditure of these loan funds created
a boom, and directed labour into the con-
struction of public works, to the neglect and
destruction of reproductive industries.
The collapse of the borrowing boom,
coupled with our fiscal policy, has left us
without the necessary industries to yield
employment to our present army of workers,
while we have 25,000 young Australians
from our schools seeking admittance annually
into the industrial ranks.
To meet this position foreign trade ad-
vocates and journalists are advising us to put
all our energies into the production of law
material for export to Europe. In fact, we
are advised not to encourage the home pro-
duction of ordinary necessaries, so that their
import may provide EMPLOYMENT FOR
FOREIGN VESSELS to carry our raw pro-
duce to European markets at low freights.
Has such a policy ever established a civi-
lised and prosperous community in any of
the new lands into which the surplus popula-
tion of Europe is flowing ? Has it done so
in any of the old settled countries of the
world ? On the contrary, its failure stands
out as a warning to avoid such a policy.
Even last year we imported, over and
above what we exported, produce SUIT-
ABLE TO OUR SOIL and Climate exceed-
ing the value of £3,000,000, not counting
iron nor manufactured articles. To supply
this home demand is our best market, and
will assist in the general development, of
other and varied industries, without which
we cannot find occupations and employment
for the rising generation.
The Single-taxers have deluded the
LABOUR PARTY into the belief that a tax
on land would benefit them. They have
likewise befooled the Freetrade party that a
land tax would be a taking cry at the very
time we are making FREE GRANTS of
land and money to induce Village Settle-
ment.
All obstacles to Agricultural Settlement
must be removed, and this can best be
effected by a law empowering cultivators to
take up, on perpetual lease, any uncultivated
land, at a rental equal to 5 per cent, on the
capital value, subject to a maximum value
of two pounds per acre.
A Land Tax for Local Government will be
as much as selectors can bear at present,
while the duties arising from a Protection
tariff will provide the necessary revenue
When increased Colonial production de-
creases the revenue from imported goods,
Lands, Incomes, Absentees and Legacies will
form fit sources of taxation.
The injustice of singling out land from
other forms of property for taxation, more
especially as a TAX ON AGRICULTURAL
LAND IS EQUIVALENT TO AN EX-
CISE DUTY ON ITS PRODUCE, must be
evident to every intelligent person not
blinded by party bias.
We have all the elements required for the
production of iron, and ABUNDANT
LABOUR for its manufacture, while we are
IMPORTING iron to the value of HALF A
MILLION ANNUALLY. Our neglect of
this matter is a disgrace to New South
Wales, and shows to what an extent we have
allowed the foreign trade element to domi-
ate our councils in the face of the fact that
NO COUNTRY in the world has been able
to establish ironworks without the aid of
PROTECTIVE DUTIES.
All the Colonies are on the same plane of
civilisation, with equal standards of living,
salaries, and wages, and therefore we have
nothing to protect against each other. It is
therefore our duty to make a great effort to
have the Colonies FEDERATED into a
GREAT AUSTRALIAN NATION, having
Freetrade throughout Australia and Protec-
tion against the world.
The time has now arrived when we must
pass a LOCAL GOVERNMENT BILL,
giving greater power to the local bodies than
was given in any of the proposed Bills made
public during the last twenty years, and
such Bill should provide that certain of these
extended powers should be submitted to a
REFERENDUM of the Municipal Elec-
tions.
The question of LOCAL OPTION lias
been a disturbing element in all elections
for the past fifteen years. Its importance
demands settlement on just and well-con-
sidered lines in the interest of the public
and publicans. This can best be accom-
plished by handing over the entire control
of the Liquor Traffic to the Municipal Cor-
porations constituted by the new Local
Government Act.
We earnestly ask all, and particularly
young, Australians to throw educational
opinions and PREJUDICES aside in the
consideration of our position, and put an
end to this INSIDIOUS INFLUENCE,
which is being exerted by foreign IMPOR-
TERS calling themselves AUSTRALIANS.

paration. Above all, “ the principal ladies
from the various theatres will have refreshment
tents, flower tents, cigar and cigarette tents, etc.
Here there is plenty of scope for reckless liberality.
The value of a cup of coffee from Nellie Stewart
has no well-defined limit, nor can rosebuds and
cigars from a Varley, a Florence Young, or a Lucy
Cobb be judged by ordinary rules of commerce.
A male customer may tender any coin of the realm
up to a pound sterling, after which the goddess
will smile upon him until his brain reels and he
forgets to ask for the change.

Dear Bulletin,— l attended a recent Melb.
Sunday night “ concert,” in the interests of the
Y.M.C.A., and found the Saturday night’s pro-
gramme in full blast, barring the burnt cork and
the dancing. Most of the performers made
one concession to the conventionalities—they sang
their comic songs with a profound solemnity that
was wildly comical. One song-and-dance damsel,
however, after an earnest effort, found that she
positively could not go through her little ditty
without the usual gyrations. She was as uncom-
fortable as a cat in skirts, and at last broke into
the familiar prance, and finished up with a running
high kick that evoked wild applause. But the
people on the stage looked as if their religious
convictions had been severely tried.—Yours,
S. Snell.

Miss Myra Kemble writes from London to a Sydney
friend:—“The only thing worth looking at now here that
Lve yet seen is ‘The Living Pictures,’ at the Palace
Theatre, late the new English Opera House. They are
mostly studies from the nude, and exact copies of Royal
Academy pictures by different artists. The girls who re-
present the figures are all artists’ models, and the result
is everything that is artistic and charming.’’
The wail of an “advance” in Victoria:—Times are
awful: we are always retreating from Moscow. People
have no money for vanities, and what little they have is
generally somebody eise’s. With a company of 14 we
have opened to 125., and this in a mining town. Every
spare 6d. was going for “ calls.” If the co. don’t happen
to strike a pay day they can confidently expect to come %
cropper, and consequently anticipation softens the knock.
Victoria needs more protection—from rogues in high
places.—H.F.C.
Denouncers of the sinful theatre must revel in the
story that Trebelli Bettini quarrelled with her daughter
because the damsel desired to marry her mother’s former
lover. Lady Dolly, in “ Moths,” had no absurd scruples
of that kind.
“Charley’s Aunt” was doing so well in London, at
latest dates, that manager Penley recommenced the
Wednesday matinees.
Flo. Graupner’s brother apparently caught typhoid
fever from her, or got it at the same place, and had a bad
time. The charming little actress is now completely
recovered and ready again for operatic action.
Ryley avers that he will return to Australia next ApriL
Marshall Hall is going to England on a flying trip at
the end of next University term to get some members for
his orchestra—the “ colonial ” article won’t altogether
do. Despite his persistent abuse of Melbourne and its
musio it is clear he means to stay.
Terriss and Miss Milward are leaving Irving and going
to the Adelphi. On dit that the fair Ellen is rather
jealous of Milward, who has been playing Marguerite at
the matinee performances of “Faust ” at the Lyceum.
People remark how fond a Sydney actor-manager is of
dragging the phrase “My Qodl” into every piece in
which he plays lead.
A company of “amateur” sassiety barnstormers
running shows round an Australian metropolis at present
are doing the “ good work ” for commission on profits.
An advt. appears in Melb. Age offering salary and com-
mission to “young ladies willing to undertake the sale of
charity concert tickets.”
Adelina Patti sang a Wagner air, for the first time in
her public life, at a recent Albert Hall concert. It was
the simplest of songs, with harp accompaniment, but a
critic says of Adelina’s rendering that it was a “ revela-
tion to those accustomed to the harsh German method of
singing.” Our Amy Sherwin was the second lady vocalist
at this particular concert, so she ought to be gleaning
some good artistic wrinkles in her middle age.
How true is that tableau of amateur theatricals, in
“Frou Frou,” where she shrinks from Valreas’ embrace,
at the rehearsal, the first step in her demoralisation 1
Mdlle. Vanhove was courted by Talma long in vain.
Both were engaged at the Theatre Fiancais. One night
the lady was clumsily dragged off by a stage villain. Ho
fell on her, at the wing, and a large pin was driven into
her chest. The doctor said the wound did not bleed
enough, and must be sucked. Talma did it. After that,
she married him.
Melbournian: “ Amateuring, like alcohol, must be kept
down. The Sacred Cause of Charity now demands stage
osculations all the week round.”
H.: “The N.S.W. newspaper-owning politician, angry
because he can get no extra notice from his own rag,

You must say my show is the best on earth.”
Hibernian: “The portrait of a young Australian
actress, daughter of one of our veterans, sets me thinking
of his career. He was in an excellent mercantile position,
35 years ago, but had the misfortune to shine as an
amateur tragedian. His friends persuaded him he was a
Brooke, and the public did not concur.”
Signor Giovanni Sisco, the promising young baritone
who was so popular in Australia during the season of the
last Italian Opera Co., died in Brazil the other day at the
early age of 29. During his illness he was watched with
tender devotion by his colleagues in the 00., which in-
cluded some of Italy’s best singers. (
Signorina Leonore Orelli, of Melb., whose success in {
amateur opera was lately mentioned in The Bulletin, has ,

■election.
Philip Newbury and his wife, Emily Spada, have, we
hear, seceded from the Belle dole 00., and the concert-
party has gone to Maoriland without them because Phil’s
terms for a benefit in the land of his youth were too warm
for the directors.
Pretty Pattie Browne has been engaged lor the
autumnal melodrama at Drury Lane.
Yvette Guilbert, the renowned singer of French risky
songs, who is just now storming London, makes £l6OO a
month. She is the champion mean woman of Paris; is
anaemic and ugly, flat-chested and hipless, with a low,
coarse voice and hair dyed champagne-yellow. They run
in all shapes.
“ A Society Butterfly ” has brought Robert Buchanan
and Clement Scott once more to loggerheads. In my
opinion (says Thk Bulletin’s London correspondent)
Scott’s furious onslaught upon the play and the acting of
Mrs. Langtry was unjustifiable. We all know that the
Lily is not a Bernhardt or a Duse, but really the did not
act so badly as one might think from reading the Daily
Telegraph. It she failed at all it was in her gowns, which,
as a man remarked, failed for their absence of indecency.
All her frocks were very simply made, and in one of the
big scenes she wore a high-necked dress, an unpardonable
sin in the eyes of those who “ went out for to see.” The
newspapers are not by any means to be taken as safe
guides to the merits of a play. Who ever reads a harsh
word in the Referee about any of Q. R. Sims’ work? And
to read “ Carados,” one would think that “ Jaunty Jane
Shore,” the new burlesque with that title, was one of the
most brilliant pieces of the day, whereas it is the most
stupid, dreary farrago of stuff that ever was put upon a
stage. And why the good notices? Bless you, are not
Riehard-Henry the greater part of Carados ? The same
thing obtains all through the chapter.
Ellen Terry will be retiring from the boards in anothe r
two or three years, for she has no desire to play middle*
aged women, and she can’t be an artless girl for ever*
Irving’s case is quite different. The great Henry is stil*
on the right side, so to speak, of his strongest impersona-
tions—Burgomaster Matthias, Louis XL, Vicar of Wake-
field, &c. The older he gets the more naturally he takes
to them.
It made one feel Methusalish to see Lillie Brjer the
other night, in a Melb. performance, acting the old
woman quite Watt-Tannery.
The clever little daughter of Dr. M‘Carthy, of Sydney,
is fiddling herself into people’s hearts, writes The Bulle-
tin’s London correspondent. If not spoiled by injudicious
adulation, and not allowed to read fulsome paragraphs,
she may one day be a fine performer. But that will be in
the distant future. One is always doubtful of the lasting
of the infant phenomenon. Here is a par. which has been
going the rounds. The child, it is said, was one day
romping with some young companions in Hyde Park,
when she heard a poor Italian boy rasping a violin in a
most excruciating way, after the manner of his country-
men. She at once rushed at the lad, seized the fiddle and
commenced to show him how it should be played, and so
charmed a crowd which had gathered to hear her, that
when she had done they gave a round of cheers, where-
upon the young lady took off the boy’s hat and, going
round the impromptu audience, gathered a tile-full of
coppers, which she handed him. It is not by such yarns
as this that the child's reputation will be made.
Competent judges prophesy that little Cissie Lottus,
the young damsel who gives imitations of popular
favourites at the ’alls, will grow into a great original
aolress. Cissie’s mother, Marie Loftus, is a clever serio-
comic singer with a reputation for extreme spiciness. A
few years back Marie used to give them some rather
naughty songs in a very naughty style.
Leumane, a man of brains, positively had strips of
Westralian press “opinions” on Leumane printed for
transmission to journalists in Sydney, Melbourne and
elsewhere. What is there in stage life to create this
fatuous regard for “ notices’’ among people who are sane
enough on all other points ? Actors and actresses fritter
away a considerable per-centage of their lives in collecting
stupid paragraphs from stupid papers and sticking them
into a book. Though they have reason to feel certain, in
many cases, that the manager wrote the notice himself
and took it round to the office, still they are prepared to
paste the gammon in a book. They are, most of them,
even capable of writing their own puffs in order to gloat
over them in secret. The appetite increases, instead of
weakening, with age, and it is universal in the profession.
Sarah Bernhardt is said to have a gigantic collection of
printed comment upon herself gathered from many lands,
and she reads the volume sometimes—reads it, mong Doo I
Few actresses, remarks The Bulletin’s London corres-
pondent, have made such big strides in her profession
as Mrs. Patrick Campbell, whose performance in “The
Masqueraders” is so disappointing-, after her success in
“The Second Mrs. Tanqueray.” The critics to a man have
been “down ” on her, and she appears to act more in-
differently each evening. As there is no effect without a
cause, a gentleman, who sat next her at supper a few
nights since, ventured to broach the subject, and soon
discovered that very strained relations exist between her
and Alexander. This is her story. She entered into an
engagement with Alexander at a small salary for three
years, which period is nearly at an end. When she was
allotted an important and difficult part in H. A. Jones’
play she spoke to Alexander and asked him to increase
her salary so as to make it somewhat commensurate with
the importance of the part. He curtly refused, and hard
words followed. "The fact is,” she said, “I am an
underpaid and badly treated woman. I loathe Mr. Alex-
ander, and he hates me just as cordially. He knows that
when my agreement with him is completed I will at once
get a salary four or five times as great as he pays me, and
that several managers are desirous of securing me. This
is gall to him, as I will not renew my engagement. I am,
of course, compelled to go upon the stage and repeat
certain lines, but no one can compel me to act, and I will
not wear myself out with playing my part in a passionate
way for such a man. Had Mr. Alexander behaved as a
gentleman tome 1 should have done my best, as it is I
decline to do so.” This is the true story of the Mrs.
Patrick Campbell failure. It is her own fault and is of
malice prepense, and, under the circumstances, one can
hardly extend much sympathy to her, for no matter how
badly Alexander may have behaved, and there is only her
word for it, she is not justified in refusing to do her best
simply because her manager, for no matter what reasen,
declines to go beyond his agreement. . . . But Mrs.
Campbell very soon realised the mistake she was
making in playing indifferently, and she now shows
something like her true form in “ The Masquer-
aders,” which is going stronger than ever. The ridiculous
and impossible “card-scene” is being most amusingly
burlesqued in “Go Bang,” and surely never did author
give so good an opportunity. H. A. Jones has, it is said,
received from Alexander the very largest weekly cheque
for “ rights” overpaid loan author. Alexander, how-
ever, is on the crest of a wave of luck, and his name alone
would draw a waggon-load of wool.
Only three of the Queensland Parlia-
mentary Labour-party were in favour of the
shearers striking forthwith. The A.L.F. influ-
ence in the party is seemingly on the wane.
Adrian Knox, who opposes Jawbone
Neild for Woollahra, pronounces against Payment
of Members, and he has also had conferred upon
him the support of the National Ass, as per
secret circular.
A curious fact about the Bombala-Eden
electorate is that the candidates go in alphabetical
pairs, thus: —Cohen, Goman—two C.’s; Wood,
Wood—two W.’s; Murphy, Myers—two M.’s ;
Harrison, Hyde—two H.’s; and Roche and
Stiles, in which case the letters come as near to
pairing as possible.
“ The meaning of the word Labour,” says
James Watson, who splits the Democratic vote
with Traill for Cook Division of Sydney, “is
wage-earner, and the Labour-platform embraces
all wage-earners.” Ergo, according to Mr. Wat-
son, the Labour-platform oannot possibly include
all workers. Traill has been an employer, there-
fore he oannot be a good Democrat. However,
Mr. Watson, who represents only one section of
workers, will not be returned for Cook, and neither
will Traill, who claims to represent all; but Mr. S.
T. Whiddon, boot-importer, who is nominated on
the National Ass secret list, and is, therefore, per-
force, opposed to payment of members and land-
taxation, will be returned.
"strictly Confidential."
THE ASS SPEAKS—IN A WHISPER.
The Bulletin has a copy of the as yet unpub-
lished list of Parliamentary candidates favoured
by the N.S. W. bogus-National Association, whose
policy, boiled down, is abolition of payment of
members and opposition to all property-taxation.

In trying to please everybody he pleased
nobody and lost his National Ass into the bargain.
His name was Parkes.
A tremendous sensation is brewing in
Sydney Masonic circles —with a pretty woman at
the bottom of it, of course.
N.S.W. Education Minister Suttor in his
heart loves not Sydney University, which long
ago rejected his father when he sought election to
its Senate.
G. H. Reid is on the National Ass’s secret
list of favoured candidates —which fact goes to
show how much the Ass believes in his land-tax
professions.
It is reckoned by somebody that the
“ good men,” in meeting assembled at Sydney
Centenary Hall the other day, were worth about
nine millions among ’em.
Mr. B. R. Wise’s political programme,
which deals almost exclusively with land-tax
reform, appears on page 17 of this issue. Wise,
by the way, is not supported by the National Ass,
which (as per secret circular) is running Olliffe
against him.
Hawthorne is the National Ass nominee
for Leichhardt, N.S.W., where Darnley, Clarke
and Holman are cutting each other’s throats in
the name of democracy. Hawthorne must win,
as things stand now. Will the three so-called
democrats at the last moment spin a coin for the
seat?
Arrangements are on the tapis for
bringing up to Sydney, from a Southern coal dis-
trict, a large number of men for the purpose of
personating sailors who will be at sea on the day
of the N.S.W. election, and who leave their elec-
toral rights behind them for the purpose. The
Bulletin hopes to see all concerned in the scheme
get three years’ hard.
It is denied that M‘llwraith is afflicted
with dropsy ; it is also denied that he is mentally
queer. The actual trouble is phlebitis with
which, by the way, Agent-General Garrick was
laid up for seven months when MTlwraith was in
London. The ex-Premier’s doctors have forbidden
him to discuss politics or public matters. Premier
Nelson lias seen him once, and his private secre-
tary, clever young Dutton, twice only since his
return to Brisbane. The news of the Ayrshire
Downs woolshed fire has, of course, been withheld
from him.
It is now clear that the Queensland
Government will need additional strength. MTl-
wraith cannot hope to be of any assistance during
the first three months of the ensuing session, and
the not very brilliant Walter Horatio Wilson
may soon have to resign one or both of his port-
folios owing to the serious illness of his law part-
ner. Though the dailies carefully suppress the
fact, Mr. Wilson has decided to look after his big
business and drop politics awhile. Should he do
so, Philp will probably succeed him at the Educa-
tion Office. The loquacious Dairymple may be
the new man in the Ministry.
Sydney Telegraph remarks :
It is stated that fully half the adult male population
have been disfranchised by the operation of the new
Electoral Act.
This is such an obvious lie that the Telegraph
daren’t assert it on its own account, so it vaguely
says, “It is stated.” And it hasn’t even the
courage to say who stated it, perhaps for the suffi-
cient reason that it wasn’t stated at all, or perhaps
because it was only stated by the National Ass.
The Electoral Act, even if it and the people
who run it did their very worst, couldn’t
disfranchise “ fully half ” —it is questionable
if it could disfranchise even a tenth—of
the male population. But the Telegraph
loathes manhood suffrage in its inmost soul,
and is already aiming at its repeal by trying to
prove that “it is stated ” to be less liberal than
the old property vote. Before the country accepts
this glaring Ananias it wants to know who
“ stated ” it. The thing that is only reported to
.'■have been stated by some party unknown doesn’t
carry much weight.

Parliamentary Elections.
Preetrade and Land Reform
Electoral Committee.
Extracts from the Manifesto of the
President, Mr, B. JB. Wise, to his
constituents, the Electors of Flinders
Division
A Parliament, which no lover of his country will
remember without shame, has at last been allowed
to die; and you have thus regained, so far as the
defective Electoral Law permits, the constitutional
right of controlling your own representatives,
which was taken from you in October last by a
dishonest exercise of the Executive power.
At no period in our history has there been a
more urgent necessity for candour, sincerity, and
courage in the treatment of public affairs. An
honest effort to remove or mitigate the pressing
difficulties of our social and industrial life can no
longer be evaded or delayed. The conscience of
the people is being stirred to its depths; and every
man will have to bear his part in dealing with the
social questions of the day.
One of the most appalling phenomena of modern
times is that in a country such as ours, of limitless
resources and enormous wealth, our lands should
remain unpeopled while our people starve.
Evidences are accumulating from every side,
with a force which no one can overlook, that the
root cause of the social unrest and industrial dis-
tress, which are paralysing the energies of the
human race, is to be sought in faulty conditions of
land tenure.
Under existing systems of taxation every effort
of brain or muscle, by whomsoever or wheresoever
made, tends to increase the value of land and
render its use more costly. Much land is accord-
ingly held back from use in expectation of a rise
in price, and encouragement is given to a most un-
wholesome form of speculation.
Yet every rise in the price of land, which is not
due to the direct application of labour to the soil,
but to the expenditure of public money or the
growth of population, is at the expense of
wages and profits in every industry. Land being
necessary to the carrying on of all pursuits
'and industries —being, in fact, the raw material
of human existence—the citizens of a community
cannot be continuously raising its price against
themselves without crippling their own energies*
Under present conditions men no sooner come
together to enjoy society than, by the mere aggre-
gation of numbers, as if they were haunted by
some fatal destiny, they began to deprive them-
selves of that which is necessary to them as the
air they breathe —the use of land. Must this
Nemesis ever dog the footsteps of the human
race? This is the riddle of the Sphinx which we,
as a nation, must solve, or die I
One most urgent measure of relief is an adjust-
ment of the burdens of taxation to the proper
shoulders. There should bo neither taxes upon
industry nor taxes on improvements; but every
encouragement should be given to those who gain
a livelihood directly from the soil, whether as
farmers, pastoralists or miners, to put whatever
land they occupy to its most productive use.
A small tax upon the unimproved value of land,
which would probably not exceed one penny in the
£ on the true value of land, as ascertained by
periodic valuations after deducting the value of j
all improvements, would not only stimulate in-
dustry by bringing into use much land that is
now closed to settlement, but would make possible
the remission of all duties of Customs and Excise,
except those on stimulants and narcotics, and
thus destroy a wrong-headed system of taxation,
which restricts the purchasing power of all classes
in the community. Further, such a tax would
restore to the State some portion of that increment
to the value of private lands which the State has
itself created. Viewed in this light, a tax on un-
improved land values becomes nothing more than
a just, simple, and general application of the prin-
ciple of Betterment.
The State-earned increment to the value of
private lands in New South Wales amounts to the
enormous sum of .£143,000,000; that is to say,
while the State has parted with these lands for
=647,000,000, of which .£13,000,000 still remain
unpaid, their present unimproved value is
-6190,000,000, while the improvements on them are
separately estimated at .£126,000,000.
No misrepresentation or appeals to class preju-
dice should be allowed to obscure these plain facts.
The Democratic policy in finance is not to increase
but to reduce taxation ; and at the same time to
re adjust its incidence. Nor are those who advo-
cate a tax on land values necessarily supporters of
the single tax. For my part, I would vote for the
continuance of Stamp Duties. Probate Duties
Customs Duties on stimulants and narcotics*
Excise Duties on the same articles, License Fees’
and other miscellaneous methods of obtaining
revenue; so that I can only be called a Single
Taxer by someone who has never learnt arithmetic
and does not know how to count.
As an Australian, I shall devote my beet
energies to aid in bringing about the union of the
colonies without further delay.

Mr. G. .Baumann, the big Sydney caterer
and restaurateur, of 107 Pitt-street, announces by
circular that he has reduced his prices all-round
to suit this desolate and hungry epoch. Bau-
mann’s price-list is a wonderful essay on the art
of feeding, and embodies more rich and abstruse
provender than The Bulletin ever heard of
before, but as the staff generally takes a banana
at one o’clock, the document is more interesting
than useful. So far as its knowledge goes,(how-
ever, the tariff is about the lowest, quality con-
sidered, upon record.

REDFERN ELECTORATE.
Mr. H.C. HOYLE,
Who is a straight-going Protectionist, is running
for the Red fern seat.
1. —The Parliament will not be complete
without him.
2. —The Country requires his Services.
3. —Red fern must no.t lose him.
4. —He is a Consistent Democrat, a Fearless
Defender of the Working Classes, and a
Staunch Advocate of the National Cause.
As the Country is in need of men with plenty of
backbone, VOTE for HIM to a Man.
RAND WICK ELECTORATE
Gentlemen,—
I respectfully beg to remind you of
the absolute necessity for all sterling Free-
traders, and lovers of freedom and liberty,
to record their votes in my favour on next
Tuesday.
Don’t forget that Freetrade is true Federa-
tion, and that Protection and Federation
are diametrically opposed to each other;
and, further, that it is impossible to sink
the fiscal question.
Ifc will come up in the next Parliament,
and every member will be compelled,

Parkes has been bombarded with con-
gratulations on the attainment of his 79th birth-
day last Sunday. A Sydney D.T. interviewer
went with a blithesome, springy step to dive into
the old man’s recollections of infancy, and ex-
tracted much information regarding his capacity
for goo-goo utterance and mud-pie manufac-
ture. Singularly enough, however, the veteran
omitted the one thing material, and did not say
that he owes his strength and health, under Pro-
vidence, to a judicious use of Marshall’s Tonic
Nervine, sold at corner of Pitt and Park streets,
Sydney. .
Sir W. Muddle had been speaking for
three solid hours all about Freetrado and its
drawbacks ; extolling Protection and the benefits
to be derived from this system, for the country
in general and his constituents in particular—
provided, of course, he was not left in the cold.
When he and his friends adjourned to refresh
themselves —“ I tell you what, Sir William,” one
of them remarked, looking wise, “I fear you have
not much show. Next time you address electors
see that they are provided with Frossard’s Swiss
Cigars, which are light, aromatic and do not try
the nerves; they will then listen to you like
lambs; they will be as happy as possible, and
will vote for you to a man. The expense would
be but a trifling one, considering that the price is
2s. fid. per bundle of 25.
In this enlightened age of scientific inven-
tions and mechanical contrivances fresh novelties
are constantly coming under public notice.
Messrs. Hannam and Go., Queen’s Place, Sydney,
have patented a very ingenious apparatus for the
supply in less than three minutes of hot water
sufficient for a warm bath. With a mere handful
of shavings and a few chips, sufficient to light an
ordinary fire, Mr. Hannam, having applied a
lighted match, closes the door and within the
time specified, having turned on the cold-water
tap, a supply of hot water is produced not less
than ten gallons at 150 degrees Fahrenheit. The
warmer, in which the heat is used in its passage
through the internal tubes, produces this won-
derful result. A visit to Queen’s Place will con-
vince the most sceptical of the domestic comforts
to be derived from this clever invention.
That enterprising firm, Messrs. Joshua
Bros., Ltd., Melbourne, have succeeded in estab-
lishing for themselves a world-wide reputa-
tion for their Australian brandy, the product
of Australian grapes. They have invested
no less a sum than .£300,000 in this gigantic con-
cern, and during the year 1893 fully 90,000 gallons
were disposed of in the English market. It is
now a favourite brand with the British public,
and has successfully coped with the vigorous com-
petition of French exporters. The Sydney agency
which was established some six months ago, reports
favourably of the support which has been accorded
since its inception. The partial failure which has
attended the grape-crop during recent years
in France has materially affected both the
quantity and quality distilled in that country.
The consequence is that a greater demand has
been created in the consumption of whisky, and
the excessive run on the latter has led to the
exhaustion of old distillments, the natural result
being that Scotch distilleries have been compelled
to send to Australia whiskies of less maturity.
Joshua Bros.’ brandy has a beautiful mellow
flavour, and is devoid of that unpleasant after-
taste on the palate which brandy-drinkers often
experience.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
George Adams has taken prompt action in the
matter of the leakage in one of “ Tattersall’s ’’ sweeps,
complained of by a correspondent in a recent Bulletin.
The blame has been traced to a clerk, at once dismissed;
and all possible precaution has been taken to prevent
information regarding drawers from slipping out in the
future. Further, Adams engages to pay no money except
to the holder of the ticket; and if any drawer wants to
hedge, he can apply to G.A. to do the business for him.
This sets things on a satisfactory basis, and nothing less
was expected from the conductor of “ Taltersall’s,” whose
word is gold with the sporting community of Australia.
• « • •
The Bulletin’s attempt to improve upon
Apsley as a “ tip ” for the G.N. Hurdle Race was a dis-
tinct failure, for poor Bill finished fourth only. There
were but four horses in the race a quarter of a mile from
home, and any chances that might have been possessed
by Neli, Ixion, or Bill aforesaid, were probably washed
away by rain. The light-weight won easily through the
heavy going. Just now the Messrs. Manifold are having
the good time that comes to good sportsmen occasionally,
wherefore Corangamite seems the least unwise investment
for Saturday’s Steeplechase. If|Busaco should start a hot
favourite he may be reckoned to have a great show, and
Mikado 11. is bound to carry top-weight into the front
rank, anyway. Trojan’s queer leg is, perhaps, not queer
enough to ruin his chance of taking the race a second
time, but on the principle that nothing succeeds like
success, Corangamite is better worth backing than any of
them.

Bob Ellis, physically the soundest and best of
the N.S.W. older jockeys, is having a run of luck just
now. With rarely more than one mount he has managed
to score a win almost every Saturday for some time past.
* ♦ * * r
The action of the V.R.O. stewards in preventing
0.8. from competing at the Grand National meeting,
owing to a trifling slip in the nomination, is not creditable
to that body. Under A. J.C. rules any such paltry slip
can be amended at any time prior to tbs starting of tbs
race upon payment of £6.

Moton Moss, prince of life-insurance canvassers,
who is said to have dropped at least a little of his hard-
earned £lB,OOO on the Melbourne turf, insured the late
President Carnot’s life for £lO,OOO in three American
offices, three years ago. He also insured “ Tummy,” the
Duke of Clarence, Prince George, the Lord Mayor of Lon-
don, and other big wigs, for £lO,OOO apiece. A
“ colonial,” too, was Moton. His late Fire King, by the
way, has a fair show in some of the big hurdle-events
this winter.

Mr. Handioapper Scarr has been 'appointed by
A. J.C. to watch for suspicious runners on,the proprietory
courses about Sydney. The A. J.C. would have done well
to commence operations at Randwick, where there is just
as much Johnny Armstrong business as on the suburban
courses. However, under all the circumstances of his
position, Mr. Scarr would be a plucky man to tackle some
of the most notorious of the “ cronk ” division at Rand-
wiok.

The Northern Union footballers were completely

A respectably-dressed but by no means wealthy
Eunter, who has a most striking resemblance to Martin
oughlin, took £5 to ss. on Saturday that he would get a
wager to £4OO booked about Apsley. It came off first
time (£4OO to £lOO on the nod). “ I was not so much
surprised at getting the bet, but ’Eood, the bookie didn’t
ask my name even,’’ explains the backer. “ It’s not my
fault if he took me for my rich counterpart.”
Sydney bicyclists had a good time in Brisbane
on Saturday. L A. Simpson, the elect of the N.S.W.
Bicycle Union, won the Three Miles Handicap : but in the
Five Miles Interprovinoial Bicycle Race he could only run
second to W. U Kerr, who went over from Sydney to
compete on hie ownjaooount. Next Saturday Kerr and
Simpson meet in the Fire Miles Bioycle Interprovtncial
Championship.

Lord Rosebery, it appears, was wildly excited by
the victories of Ladas in the Guineas and Derby, and Lon-

ance if he owns many more crack racers and waxes so

bery had very little cause to lose his head in this manner.
He merely cultivated a calm demeanour when his
favourites got beaten.

S.A. v. Vic. interprovinoial football match is an
annual farce for which the former province is responsible.
Last season, when the match was played in Adelaide, the
Port Adelaide club was in Melbourne, thus weakening the
S.A. team. This year the Norwood club refused to go to
Melbourne second-class and no Norwood player was in-
cluded. What sort of an amateur is the player who has
all his expenses paid and then refuses to travel other than
first-class ?

Victorian Legislative Assembly has thrown out
Murray’s Totalisator Bill by 28 to 16 votes, although
Murray urged that the tote would cure that hitherto
supposedly incurable disease known as “metallic fever.’’
Frank Madden opposed the Bill on the sapient ground
that “the totalisator would not improve the breed of
horses, because owners would have no means of recouping
their expenses.” Ergo: Owners now have means? But
this opens up too many dark labyrinths.

Dear Bulletin, —Men who have read their own

and that when he goes to Sydney he will try his favourite

Ante-post betting on the G.N. Hurdle Race
was scarcely worth mentioning this year, although not
relatively tamer than the Derby and Cup, which used to

Whilst the Vio. Assembly was throwing out its
Totalisator Bill on the alleged ground that it would
increase betting, the Maoriland House of Representatives
was objecting to any interference with the machine in
that country. There the members can speak as experi-
enced critics.
• • * •
Frank Madden gob off some hyper-puerile bal-
derdash on the tote question in Vic. Assembly. He even
discovered a quotation from some unknown authority—
a hook-nosed tobacconist, perhaps—“ Anything is good
enough to run under the ‘ tote.’ ” For the life of him
Madden could not have found a grain of sense in his sug-
gestion, Under the tote system of betting a horse
couldn’t be good enough to run unless it were good
enough to win occasionally, whereas, with a bookmaker to
work for him, an owner may get some “ milking " money
out of a three-legged animal. The immediate effect of
the tote is to produce a lively competition between good
horses, and reduce the number of stiff ’uns. And com
petition in machine-betting must result in good odds all
round.

Although the Melb. dailies, without exception,
continue to grovel before the football god, the glory of
that unseemly idol is fading apace. It may be that the
marked superiority of one score of players over all the
other scores of players accounts somewhat for diminished
attendances at matches and the dearth of football fights
at street corners, but anyhow the game must have passed
the meridian of its popularity. Intelligent people are
sick of trying to feel an interest in the legions of Billies,
and Petes, and Jacks, and Geordies who are all of them
so wonderful that the evening rags must publish hideous
portraits of them. There are too many distinguish* d
footballers for a man to remember their names, if he
wants to remember anything else in this life. Also, they
are too monotonously brainless in appearance to be dis-
tinguishable one from the other, except to the trained
larrikin eye. It generally happens that a respectable
enthusiast cheers Geordie in mistake for Billy, and when
he makes up his mind to get excited over the real Billy
he wastes his lung-power over Pete, or Sandy, or Mac.
He discovers his errors occasionally, arid bis enthusiasm
becomes damp.
• * -
What is the reason of the kicking of Australian-
game footballers being so much superior to the Rugby
players? Forty yards is reckoned quite a fair distance
among the latter, while the Melb. or Adelaide man who
couldn’t do ten or fifteen additional yards would be soon
put out of a senior team, unless other points of his play
compensated.
• • • •
Proudfoot and Collins, Melbourne’s two giant
footballers, are both members of the police force, and
play respectively for the Collingwood and St. Kilda clubs;
the bell-bottomed, tobacoo-juioe-stained barrackers of
those suburbs being in the uncertain position of either
having to abandon their patriotism or to howl eulogies at
a hated oopman, who next week may be "lumbering”
them for insulting behaviour.
• • * •
No less than six fights between Sydney and
Melb. representative stoushers have taken place within
the last month down South. So far, the result would
infer that the smellful air of the Yarra is more conducive
to good boxing than Harbour ozone. There is a belief
that most of these fights were arranged privately by
Parkes and Patterson to stave off Federation.
* ♦ • •
Dan Keely, a rising Vio. pug., is matched to
fight Pyrmont Quigley at an early date. Keely is a man
of capitalistic build-in fact, stripped, his body and limbs
are smooth as bladders of lard, not a line or muscle show-
ing, but nevertheless he is about the smartest heavy-
weight the writer has yet seen. If he can stand punish-
ment and last out he should shortly be an aspirant for
the championship with a fair probability of obtaining it*
Perhaps the Romans weren’t such fools, after all, in train-
ing their pugilists “ fat.”

St. James Gazette digs out an old story with
a moral in it for the backers of horses. A rich and enter-
prising sport used to keep an elaborate record of the
form of all the great horses of the day. He worked the
results out with arithmetical precision—and then he lost
the book, and with it all the plans for a whole season’s
racing campaign. His anguished advertisements all
failed to bring back the missing volume, but it turned up
at last in the pocket of a suicide in the Thames. Said
suicide had backed the tips until they made him home-
less, and then he ballasted himself with the book and
went overboard.

HERR RASSMUSSEN, PH.D.
A Few Sketches of His Interesting Life and
Work.
Here. Rassmussen,' who is known throughout
the world as “The Celebrated Danish Her-
balist,” was born in the little kingdom of Den-
mark, shortly after its last disastrous war with
Germany. His parents being wealthy, and
belonging to the most influential class, he
received a first-class education, and displayed
exceptional talent in the science of botany and
botanical chemistry, and very soon surpassed
everyone of his fellow scholars in those sub-
jects, and eventually made the science of botany
his life-study.
Finding his native country too small, and its
flora too limited to extend his botanical re-
searches, he left for Australia, and landed here
in the beginning of 1879. His first object was
to learn the English language and become
familiar with the customs and habits of his
adopted country, as well as with its botanical
history and medicinal flora. Herr Rassmussen
had quite his share of the troubles and difficul-
ties which usually befall a newcomer in Aus-
tralia ; but he soon overcame every difficulty,
and after five years’ travelling through all the
colonies, investigating every known Australian
medicinal plant, and discovering many new
ones, he eventually settled down permanently
in Sydney in 1883, and then commenced a
most noble mission—that of turning his most
wonderful botanical discoveries to the benefit
and relief of suffering humanity. Herr Rass-
mussen succeeded in this gigantic undertaking
far beyond all expectations, and his name very
soon became a household word, not only in
every Australian camp, village and city, but
also throughout Europe, Africa and America.
Space will not permit to mention the
numerous cures effected by his now world-
famed Alkaline Remedies, suffice it to say:
that thousands of original testimonials may be
inspected by anyone at his Head Depot, 547
George Street, Sydney, many of which may
also be seen in his celebrated work, “The
Natural Doctor.”
There is no doubt whatever that Herr Rass-
mussen deserves all the success and praise which
he has met with, because he is a most scientific,
conscientious and genuine herbalist—his last
ten years record being so wonderful that his
remedies must have cured more human suffering
in that period than is usually effected by a
hundred average doctors in a similar number of
years. He does not hold any consultation
similar to a doctor; his whole business is
purely a Proprietary Herbal Remedy Business.
He simply prepares a genuine herbal remedy
specially for the nerves, and another for the blood,
and so on, which can always be relied upon.
He prints on the box containing the remedy its
price and all advice as to doses and diet and
other particulars, and advertises same, which
is the fairest way possible to conduct a business
of this kind. Any information or particulars
desired are given or sent absolutely free of
charge. Pamphlets are sent post free to any
person desiring one, containing all particulars
and many useful and valuable hints on health.
Herr Rassmussen has very large branches
of his extensive business in Melbourne,
Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Wellington (N.Z.),
and throughout the world. He is an
honorary member of several scientific socie-
ties, a gold medalist, diplomee and Hon.
Corr. Mem. of the Academic Parisienne des
Inventeurs, France ; last year he received the
Honorary University degree of Doctor of
Philosophy ; in 1887, he was presented with a
magnificent gold medal by several of his cured
patrons in Sydney, and also awarded a silver
medal in Denmark, 1888, a bronze medal,
Melbourne, 1893; and in 1891 he issued his
“ Natural Doctor,” a herbal medical work of a
high standard for which he received great
praise from the press, and which is now trans-
lated into many languages.

Peter Maher, the “Irish champion,” is being
boomed in America since his defeat of the old darkey,
George Godfrey. John L. Sullivan and others now swear
by him, no doubt in the hope of getting someone to take
down Corbett. As Australians Goddard and Fitzsimmons
made easy meat ot the Irishman, it is a forlorn hope
indeed.
• • * *
Of course, we all how! at Corbett’s delaying of
a meeting with Peter Jackson, but what a fool the Yank
would be to chance losing such a money-making concern
as the championship ! Times have changed, in the old
days of the ring, a champion was in luck if he made
enough out of a couple ot hours’ smashing match to last
him until his features had resumed something like their
normal condition, and some other aspirant could raise a
score or two of backing. To-day the pugilistic champion-
ship is a marketable commodity. The holder wears a
frock-coat and glossy tall-hat. He is sought after by all
sorts and conditions of men—and women—and his title is
worth so many pounds a week in hard cash. Small
wonder he puts off, until fairly cornered, the chance of
parting with such a bonanza.

Editor Bulletin,— Re the blind sportsmen of
King-street, Sydney. A few years ago there lived in
Waverley a middle-aged man who was totally blind. He
was a tobacconist and his shop was the resort of most of
the sporting residents, for “Oid Crad ” was a sporting
encyclopedia. He attended all Randwick and suburban
meetings, and at times even went as far as the Hawkes-
bury. For a long while he laid the odds on the Flat or in
the St. Leger reserves at these places with the assistance
of a mate, Crad carrying the bag and shouting the odds
while the mate did the booking. He was able to pick a
sovereign or any other coin out of a handful, and I never
knew him to give incorrect change. After hearing the
weights for any big event read over a couple of times he
could invariably tell you any horse’s handicap without a
mistake. I have heard him describe a race, how it was
run, what led at such a point, where the favourite was at
the turn, how he was going, and whether the jock, was
sitting still or riding—in fact, he could give a most
minute description of the race from start to finish, and ot
how it was won and lost. “ When I seen Tommy Hales
sitting still on Abercorn at the turn, and Mat. Harris
riding Melos, I knew it was ail over "—and so on. When
the interprovineial yacht-races were being sailed here I
walked into his shop one night and happened to mention
that I had witnessed the race from Bellevue Hill. “Ah !”
said he, “ I wish someone had called in for me. There’s
nothing I like to see so much as a good yacht-race.’^—

At the various Melb. boxing matches it is
curious to see how the order of “ Pipes out,” usually
given at the beginning of each evening, is regarded. In
the two-shilling quarter, smoking stops almost instantly
while, in the five and ten-shilling seats, the gilded youths
and dead beats continue to pollute the air that the boxers
have to breathe, until the force of cries from the other
parts of the house frightens them into obedience.

Little Johnnie Sheridan, when at Melb. Opera
House, grovelled to his bookmaker patrons by singing
topical verses condemning the tote. The confusion of
Johnnie’s arguments was utterly reckless. He would
start with the statement that nothing under Heaven
could give greater satisfaction than Ikey Mo. Then the
misguided comedian would admit the tote’s claims to
regard by promising that his Hebrew friends would, if
necessary, “lay even lonyer odds” than the accursed
machine. Whereat the little mob of jewelled “metal-
licians ” always cheered vigorously, but never a gallery-
boy had wit enough to remark that a man who betted
only a little more liberally than the tote might as well
give guineas for pounds.

It is melancholy to find ex-“ demon ” Spofforth
still maundering on about the Australia v. England match
of 1882. Even more melancholy to find newspapers
solemnly quoting Spoff.’s opinions from his latest book.
Who cares whether the extinct volcano “ firmly believes ”
that somebody lost the match by not stepping out to hit,
or Grace has never swerved from his conviction that
another fellow might have changed the result by pursuing
different tactics ? Bah !

George Buhear (writes The Bulletin’s London
correspondent) has suddenly improved out of ail recogni-
tion, and is now sculling in such form that, almost
beyond all doubt, he would very easily turn the tables
upon some of his recent conquerors, including the re-
doubtable Sullivan himself. It is even said that Sullivan
is not by any means anxious to meet him. Buhear is now
“gaffered” by Pony Moore, so money is not lacking.

Thechances in the coming Jackson-Corbettaffair
may be summed up thus. The men met two or three
years ago, w’len honours were even. Jackson was then
in had condition and suffering from a sprained ankle, they
say. Yarns of this kind, however, are suspicious, for, as
“ Pendragon ” once wrote, no defeated pugilist acknow-
ledges himself fit. And, in this case, a draw was tanta-
mount to a defeat with Jackson, who, probably, held his
opponent too cheap, and, anyway, could not have re-
cover d from Masonic junketings during his flying visit
to Australia. But Corbett was (hen almost a novice,
facing a man of world-wide prestige. To-day, on the
contrary, the white man has the credit of having put
dowm Mitchell, Sullivan and Kilrain, and can face Jackson
far u more confidence. Then he is a careful-flying
leuow who throws no chances away. Time, too, has beta
on ms own side. In the ordinary course of nature, ho
must have gained strength and stamina, while Peter must
have lost, "there is an old sporting aphorism—•• Youth
will be served.”
Vaccination has just been a draw at a
church bazaar. Small-pox being prevalent,

FOR
LASSITUDE,
TORPIDITY,
SOUR STOMACH,
INDIGESTION,
HEADACHE,
BACKACHE, &c.,
Take a couple of Fletcher’s Pills every second
night ; they are a prompt and sure cure and give
certain relief.
FLETCHER’S PILLS are a quick, sure, and
reliable remedy for all complaints arising from
torpid liver, indigestion, weak stomach, and
impurities of the blood. They are prepared on
rational and sensible lines, and do not contain a
particle of calomel, gamboge, or any drastic pur-
gative, but operate by perfectly natural means by
stimulating the liver and increasing the flow of
bile, and thus producing easy evacuations and
natural catharses without the annoyance and pain
ot griping and purging.
Beware of the many harmful substitutes on sale
in many shops. None are genuine unless they
bear the signature of F. Moore Clements on the
outside wrapper! CLEMENTS TONIC and
FLETCHER’S PILLS have become such house-
hold words that imitations are frequently offered.
We contend that this imitation is the sinoereaib
proof of their virtues, so see that you always get
the genuine, bearing the name and .address of F.

The apotheosis of thrift : Speaking
through your nose to save the wear and tear of
your false teeth.
Dear Bulletin,—What is Tyson to Skin-
flee, the N.S.W. squatter, who sold his station
for ■£40,000 cash and declined to give a receipt for
the money unless he was paid for 251bs. of meat in
the beef-cask and a load of wood—-two items which
had, so he said, been overlooked in making out
the inventory ?—J.M,
M'Burney, Wallis & Co.’s Report.
This week has been marked by the receipt of a cable-
gram from our London agents quoting a 5 per cent, rise
in wool, except for coarse bred. Owing to the.receipt of
this good news we were enabled to make some very satis-
factory private sales. We would caution the wool-grower
against the expectation that the rise in wool will develope
into a large increase. We still think the real test must be
looked for when our sales open here, and we have good
reason to believe we will then be in a position to report
better prices to those who entrust their wool to our care.
The recent good news from London seems to have given
a stimulus to operations at the sheep sales during the
week, and the large number of sheep offered were worked
off so readily that a looker-on would be inclined to think
money is not as tight in our colony as we are led to
believe.
The abolition of the American Import Duty on Wool
seems to progress favourably, and if not protracted too
long must have a favourable impression on the Sydney
wool sales of the coming season.

Morals Police, translated
from “La Lanterne,” and issued by the National (London)
Association for Repeal of the Contagious Disease Acts.
The lesson to be learnt is obvious to all who have a
knowledge of the frightful personal power given to a
special class of spy-police in England over all women in
the districts where the Acts are in operation, and should
the Acts be extended to the whole of the United King-
dom, and also to the Colonies, who will dare to say that
the liberty of all English women will not be seriously
imperilled? Post free, in sealed envelope, Is. 6d. Only

want us to pay you for it. If we paid you for it we could
put you in gaol for false pretences. We have no time to
put you in gaol. You haven’t brains enough for a literary
thief; take to burglary H.M.: Can’t follow your
reasoning; an insurance co. advances no capital to in-
sured, as creditor to debtor. The Bulletin doesn’t oppose
federation of English-speaking races, or of any other races
if the contracting parties are on equal terms. What it
does oppose is the idea that the life-blood of Australia is
to be sucked to support the grandeur of England

Re bullet-proof clothing. Many late ex-
periments- are denounced as mere tricks. The
force of impacts is known to experts. A regula-
tion bullet fired from a regulation rifle strikes with
the power of three thousand pounds, or a ton and
a-half, and this would kill a bullock, even if_ the
bullet did not penetrate the prepared medium.
The recoil of such a rifle is equal to a blow of one
hundred pounds, and yet the music-hall chit of
sixteen is supposed to oppose these forces with
perfect impunity and the set smile of a circus-
rider.
A new and rather promising paper —the
Searchlight, published at Auckland (M.L.) —has
come to hand. It contains eleven pages of read-
ing, about three of which are interesting matter
borrowed from The Bulletin. Most of these
borrowings are not acknowledged in any way,
and are cheerfully passed off as the Searchlight’s
own original ideas. Those columns which are not
borrowed are tolerably dreary, and the illustra-
tions look as if they had been engraved with a
dinner-fork.
Australia last year contributed £4OO more
to the China-Ireland Mission than in the year
preceding. That means several things, but
chiefly that religious fanaticism is not extinct in
Australia. In a year of unexampled suffering
and distress, the godly, under the influence of
their spiritual guides, were willing to take ,£4OO
from their starving neighbours for a fad which
has not even success to recommend it; seeing
that of all the proselytising agencies at work
among “ the poor heathen*” the G.I. M. has the
smallest return in converts in proportion to the
magnitude of its machinery.
A recent criticism of the work of Charles
Keene,- the beslavered London Punch artist,
expresses a pretty general opinion : “ Keene drew
one, and only one, scratchy type of comic man —
who was in turn butler, gardener, publican, duke,
college don, cabman and farmer —for 30 years in
Punch. He could not draw a pretty woman, a
gentleman, a lady, a child or a horse to save his
life. After death he has been accorded as much
insincere praise as Wordsworth himself.” Even
Du Maurier has more variety than Keene, for the
one-eyed Frenchman certainly depicts the changes
in drawing-room furniture and dresses as the
years roll on. But perhaps D.M. has ceased to
illustrate the cockney standard “ funny ” paper.
From a private letter received in Sydney
from Fort Salisbury, Mashonaland :
During the recent war we were nearly starved ; nothing
to eat but sodden Kaffir corn. We received no pay, but a
farm, God knows where, in Matabeleland. The Chartered
Co. have occupied Matabeleland now, and are selling
township blocks in Buluwayo at £4O each. It is a fine
country compared with this dreadful fever-stricken hole.
Our hospital is full of fever-patienls just now'. Everyone
gets it sooner or later. lam surprised at your account of
wages in Australia. In the Transvaal and Orange Free
State stonemasons and bricklayers, when they work, get
30s. per day, and carpenters 255. Work here at Fort
Salisbury is completely at a standstill owing to the rains
stopping all traffic. We have a Bishop of Mashonaland
now. I see that, in an interview, he denies that the
Matabele prisoners of the late war w'ere shot, or ill-
treated in any way. Also he praised “the devotion of the
Chartered Co.’s doctors 1” I wonder where he expects to
go to when he dies?
Rev. Thomas Broughton Tress, who ha s
cared for the spiritual needs of Woolloomooloo for
12 years, with a salary of £4OO and residence,
received an offer of £6OO and residence from
Richmond, Vic. After “careful meditation and
prayer” he perceived a distinct “divinity” in
the “call,” and, of course, like a faithful soldier,
obeyed. At the send-off, the other night, the rev.
gentleman “seemed much affected.”:—
THE MUG’S IDEA.
Whilst sitting here it just struck me
I’m where hundreds would like to be.
But what a great surprise, old boy,
For them that come their hick to try ;
The boomers with their skilful art,
Aided by the press, have done it smart
By advertising with fiendish glee
The extensive wealth of Coolgardie.
But there’s a great surprise in store
For them that tramp the sa <1 plains o’er,
As the golden country on the map
Is found to be nought but a trap,
And it’s a fact it kind of narks
To know we’re had by m ney sharks.
Yes, you may bet the business lot
Reckon to have us in their pot.
For prices here are just hell-hot,
Too bad for any sinner’s lot.
With onions a bob per pound
Surely there is grumbling ground,
But we stick to our dishes and go dry-blowing,
The longer we work the more we’re owing,
And all but a tory would excuse our mag
O’er the cost of filling a water-bag.
Yet bits of bait are still being set
To get fresh mugs into the net.
Some editor reports a find . ..
Foy which he’s been well paid and wine d

Whose working fakes upon this job ;
But, God, the prayers that's raised so thick
Forbid to fall upon this clique.
They work it nicely to appear
That water’s all that’s wanted here.

For sixty yards down it is always met.
With these remarks I’ll end my wail,

By all means get him o’er this way.
A MEREWETRER MUG.
There came a call from Richmond, Vic.,
It was a call divine,
For T. B. Tress to fight Old Nick
Across the border-line ;
And one of Thomas Broughton’s eyes
Did gently close its lid,
The other gazed into the skies
And read—“ Six hundred quid 1”
Clear came that call—“ O come, O come 1
You need not long delay ’’ —
And T.B. softly murmured “ Hum,
I think I’d better pray.
And, if it be bright Heaven’s choice,
To Richmond I will ‘ skid
He prayed, and lo! a “still, small voice"
Said, “Take six hundred quid !”
And goodly people gathered round
To cheer him and to bless.
And speak of all the virtues found
In Thomas Broughton Tress—
The “spirit moveth in his heart"
And Tress said, “ Yes, it did,
It makes me draw the Gospel cart 1” ,
(And draw “ Six hundred quid I’*);

Potatoes were at famine price, in Melb.
this time last year. It led to great planting in
Gippsland, the failure being of the Western crops.
Now potatoes are 501bs. for a shilling retail in
Melb.
A mice-plague rages in some of the S.A.
farming districts. During one week in June,
20,520 of the little wheat consumers were killed
at Koolnnga, the record for one night being 4686.
In other localities they measure corpses by the
bushel and the gallon.
Sydney Sunday Times gives free medical
advice, but so far it apparently has little vogue in
its quack-doctor capacity. The most momentous
prescription yet seen in its columns was long ago
and consisted of three words only ; “ Take four
pills.”
“A family of 12 children, and an invalid
wife, cause no reproach to those who fill the most
holy offices of the church, but a healthy, happy
mother and child, outside the bounds of legal
wedlock, are pictures of sin.—Mrs. Cady Stanton,
in Westminster Review.
During ’93, England imported 2,514,541
carcases of frozen sheep and lambs, and 171,640
quarters and pieces of beef, from Maoriland and
Australia, without counting 1,373,723 carcases
from the River Plate. Not a carcase per head for
the population of London alone.
Shortly after the wreck of the American
steamship the Monumental City on Talleuberger
Island, in 1854, rabbits were placed on the island
by the Vic. Government for the use of castaways.
Through eating certain herbs which grow there,
their flesh has become almost poisonous.
Maoriland law now compels shopkeepers
and others to supply seats for the use of their
female employes, who formerly had to stand on
their weary feet for ten or twelve hours per diem.
The seats are supplied accordingly, but the tired
shop-girl who sits down on one of them is “sacked”
on the instant, so things are very much as they
were.
Dear Bulletin, —A champion mean man
was he who shipped with his motherless children
on board an interprovincial steamer for a five
days’ sea voyage. The good man took a saloon
ticket, but the young ones had to go forward to
the steerage, with strict injunctions not to know
their pa when they saw him abaft the funnel.—
Shellback.
Dear Bulletin, —You have not yet dis-
covered the meanest man. He lives in the Goul-
burn valley, and owns a magnificent orchard.
Last grape-cutting a child of his, playing with a
dog, fell into the river, and was drowning when
an old man went placidly to the rescue, and
brought the little girl safely to land. What did
the wealthy father give the hero? Guess again.

The meek and harmless Chinaman soon
becomes aggressive when he gets the upper hand.
When the big Chinese rush to the Palmer set in,
about 1880, and there were 7000 Chinese to about
300 Europeans, the proud white was told every
day: “What for you Engliseeman come here?
This Chinaman rush. Engliseeman no likee
Chinaman to go Englisamanee rush.” And at one
Carpentaria town, a few years ago, all the stores
were in the hands of Chinese, and a drover, want-
ing a bit of meat, overheard John tell a woman,
who brought back a cancerous lump of bone:
“Lookaheah, missee ! Suppo you wantem meat
gotem no bone >ou buyem bit of
libbah, thasaw ! ” After that he went out and
killed a beast of his own. Things are better now,
thanks to the bush-unions.

The British Medical Journal publishes
an interesting story by Dr. J. R. Wolfe, of his
successful eye-operation in the case of M'Outcheon,
of the Commercial Bank. Dr. Wolfe, who
didn’t arrive in Melbourne until the end of Nov.
last, found Mr. M’Cutcheon suffering from one eye
blind and the other an all but “goner,” There
was a detachment of the retina of both eyes.
The specialist, to the surprise of the local faculty,
elected to perform upon the optic that was said to
be hopelessly gone. Three weeks later it was
equal to reading the time from a watch, whilst
the other eye, upon which no operation had been
attempted thus far, was wonderfully improved.
The case is destined to become a classic in the
literature of ophthalmia.
The successful removal of Piles of the
most stubborn description is being effected by
Sharp’s new “Cannalin” treatment, large quan-
tities of which are being forwarded to sufferers
throughout the colonies. It is obtainable, with
advice, from 257 George-street, Sydney.
When the Australian mail reaches Van-
couver, the artless local pressman extracts all the
murders, suicides, fires, brutal assaults, and corpses
found in the various harbours out of all the papers,
and summarises them for the benefit of his readers.
Naturally he gets the same outrage several times
over. Consequently the Australian record for
last March consisted of 337 captured burglars, 23
of them being shot dead in the act. In the same
month, 1000 unemployed waited on Premier Dibbs,
who told them, according to the Canadian press-
man, to “go and starve,” whereupon there was a
riot, and 100 arrests were made. Also a man in
Adelaide cut the throats of eight women, and
there was a dismal horror concerning a whole
family of small children eaten by pigs.
Nervous sufferers will find it worth their
while to peruse Herr Rassmussen’s advt. on page
19 of this issue.

O Heart!
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“ O heart I by dreams and fancies led#
By vain delusions fanned and fed,
There is no love,” I said.
“So rest thee; e’en though rest be rust.
The truth of things is writ in duet,
And all men’s love is lust I ”
As one smit down before his time—
Smit down to earth from heights sublime,
I fell, before my prime;
And hope went down, and on the day
Impenetrable darkness lay,
And so—l lost my way.
I lost the lines of height and hill,
I lost the power to work my will,
And my cold heart lay still.
Till, in the desert as I stood
In bitterness and solitude,
I deemed that death were good.
But, when there seemed no deeper deep,
I felt my soul rise up in sleep
And swell to flood, from neap.
I saw a light that flashed like flame,
I heard a voice that called my name.
And then, O God ! she came :
With eyes whose lights no sunsets knew,
Nor all the star-depths through and through,
Nor skies, intense with blue.
No subtle scents the seawinds bear,
Nor all the summer’s blossoms were
As fragrant as her hair.
And softly as the murmuring sea,
Or winds that whisper o’er a lea,
She said, “Come thou with me !”
And, hand in hand, we passed away
Through meadowlands with wild flowers gay,
To meet the newborn day.
Behind the hill we saw the sun
Through silver streams of radiance run,
With souls that blent in one.
And ere the day had flamed to flower.
In one too brief and blissful hour,
I knew my whole soul’s power.
Beneath her spell it seemed to grow
And gather strength, and swell and flow
From line to sky-line low,
And, like an uncaged snow-white dove,
To soar through fields of light above,
On new-found wings of love.
But on we went o’er down and lea.
Through glades made glad with melody,
Until we reached the sea.
And on its softly breathing shore
She said, “ My time on earth is o’er,
And we shall meet no more !
“The bond of love that here we tie
Shall lift thy soul from earth to sky,
And my kiss sanctify.
“Though all thy days my face shall be
A bygone dream, thou wilt give me
Thy life, ungrudgingly.
“ Wear then for me this flower of song,
And when the days to come grow long,
For my sake be thou strong.
“ I am henceforth of thee a part,
Thy inmost, undivided heart,”
She said —“ My name is Art 1”

The Southern Cross Hotel, Bourke-street,
West Melb., where the alleged murder and

able period the headquarters of Bishop Perry,

The prediction of the first Queensland
Premier (now Sir Robert Herbert) that the time
was not far off when Brisbane would possess
magnificent shops, with splendid stocks, and
crowds of customers which would vie with the
shops of London, is fulfilled to the letter to-day at
Finney, Isles & Co.’s establishment. Judging by
the continuous stream of balls containing cash
travelling along the cash-railways to the main
desk from all parts of the building, Mr. Finney '
has certainly solid grounds for saying times are
improving rapidly.
A picture of an American prohibition
city ;
In Lewiston the gin-palaces are under the streets, and
a labyrinth of passages known only to “ members in good
standing ” leads to the interior, with ever and anon a
door marked “ pull ” when it means “ push,” and
‘‘push ” when it means to the initiated “pull." This
confuses the officer, so that by the time he gets in fairly
liie decanters have been emptied dow n the sink, followed
by an acid that removes all traces, even of the odour. A
guard is above both day and night, whose duty is to press
the button when the sheriff enters, and when he gets at
lart through this devious way he finds the bar-tender
engaged in lathering and shaving a customer or shampoo-
ing him with a bottle of Angostura bitters.
SNAKE POISON AND HUMAN POISON.
Thu bite of a rattlesnake is almost always fatal to
man. Yet this snake is never affected by the
injection of its own poison into its own blood,
neither when enraged it bites itself nor when its
venom is injected by artificial means to test the
question. Speaking on the latter point Dr. S.
Weir Mitchell, an expert on snake poison, says,
“ I have over and over tried this experiment, but
in no case have I seen death result. Why should
this be ? ”
Dr. Mitchell further says : “The many noxious
compounds man carries in his liver and gastric
glands (the stomach) are fatal if they enter the
blood in any large amount. There is scarcely an
organ in man’s body which is not a possible source
of poison to him. Small doses are constantly
passing into and out of his blood. The question
is whether he can get rid of it as fast as it ac-
cumulates.”
Alluding to death by rheumatism, gout, and
kidney disease, an eminent London physician says:
“Thus man is poisoned by the products of his own
body.”
Now let us cite a passage from a man’s experience
as related by himself. The time extends over a
period from March, 1888, to May, 1889, more than
a year. He says :“ My head used to whirl around,
and I had frequent bouts of faintness and giddi-
ness ; and at such times I used to fall down, no
matter where I was. This would occur two or three
times a day. For three weeks I was confined to
my bed. I grew gradually weaker and weaker
and lost a deal of sleep. I felt more tired in the
morning than when I went to bed. After a while
I became nervous, and my legs trembled and shook
under me to such a degree that I feared to walk
out. I had great pain in my kidneys, and the
secretion which I voided from them was thick and
yellow as the yolk of an egg. Month after month
passed and I failed more and more, and could
hardly crawl about.
“I had a doctor attending me, but his medicines
did not benefit me. He said my liver and kidneys
were in a bad way, and that he never saw secretions
passed in such a state. After treating me six
months, he told me that medicine could do no
more for me and advised me to go to a hospital.
I went to Peterborough hospital, but got worse
while there. The hospital doctors refused to tell
me what ailed me. Having spent two months
there, I got anxious and returned to my home,
utterly disheartened. I continued to send to the
hospital for medicines, which I took for three
months longer. I was now so emaciated that my
friends who came to see me said I would never
get well.
“In this condition I continued until May, 1889,
when one day an umbrella vendor called at my
house, and, seeing how ill I was, said his wife had
been cured of a serious illness by Mother Seigel’s
Curative Syrup. He spoke so earnestly of it that
I determined to try it. After taking the Syrup
for ten days I felt in better spirits; my food
agreed with me, and from that time I gained
strength daily. Persevering with it, I was soon
able to return to my work as healthy and strong
as ever. Since then I have been in the best of
health. You are at liberty to publish the above
facts, and I will gladly reply to any enquiries.
Yours truly (Signed), Read Welfare, Ramsey,
St. Mary’s, Hunts, February 18th, 1892.”
No brief comment can do justice to this remark-
able case. What the public needs to know and*to
remember is this: Mr. Welfare’s whole system
was poisoned by the products of a torpid and
inactive digestion. These had entered his blood,
as Dr. Mitchell describes. The nervous system
was disordered and half paralysed; hence the
faintness and falling fits. Rattlesnake poison
kills by paralysing the nerves which actuate the
lungs; it kills by suffocation. Human poison,
arising from indigestion and dyspepsia, always
operates in the same direction, causing asthma
in its worst forms. It then attacks the
heart and kidneys, causing the state of things
Mr. Welfare mentions. Nothing more noxious,
or, in the end, surely fatal exists in any poisonous
reptile. And yet people trifle with the disease !
and doctors seem not to understand it.
Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup cures by stimu-
lating the kidneys, skin, and bowels, and toning
the gastric glands.
Who, then, is man’s most deadly enemy ? Care-
less and ignorant man himself. Use the remedy
then when the earliest symptoms appear.
OUT ON THE DEEP.
A westerly wind is blowing,
Tis furious, fast, and free ;
And the trim-built barque is going
To her haven beyond the sea ;
And the passengers murmur, knowing
How ill they will shortly be.
The steward, no doubt, is handing
The basins to those distress’d ;
Our hero, you see, is standing
With his hand on his manly breast;
He wishes he might be landing,
And so give the ocean “ best.”
But ST. JACOBS OIL, the tempest to foil,
Is pour’d on the foaming main ;
And anon comes peace, as the waves decrease,
For ST. JACOB can conquer pain.

Man and Woman.
Editor Bulletin, —Civilised life has its com-
pensations. The world is too much with us;
our youth is age, and our age bankruptcy ; we
grow anaemic, neurotic, paralytic ; but we can
enjoy Havelock Ellis’s new book, “Man and
Woman,” in the Contemporary Science series.
The unhappy happy-savage knows naught of
contemporary science. His iood dangles from
every bough, his drink is the spring (when he
can get nothing better); but his brain is not
complex enough to realise the force of the
charming reservation in the statement that “ at
Belluno, in Italy, it is customary for a priest and
a naked young girl to go (separately as a rule)
early in the morning into the fields to drive
away the caterpillars.” He pays no taxes, the
landlord never worries him; but he cannot
have the pure joy of reading that “ very likely
one of the reasons for the persistent habit of
tightening up the girth among Christian
damsels is that such constriction renders the
breathing thoracic, and so advertises the
alluring bosom by keeping it in constant and
manifest movement. The heaving of a sub-
clavicular sigh is likely to cause more sensation
than the heaving of an epigastric or umbilical
sigh.” He is frankly unconventional and im-
moral, no policeman “ runs him in,” no “ fatal
fourth ” whitens his wool; but he lives and
dies unaware that “ Dr. Savage has been
struck by the frequency of the occurrence of
general paralysis in the husbands of some
women of voluptuous physique.” Savage life
has its drawbacks.
• • •
All these things Mr. Ellis tells us. He also
supplies the information that in East Central
Africa sewing is men’s work, and a wife may
obtain a divorce if she can show a neglected
rent in her petticoat; that among many
savage tribes, at the birth of a child, the
father is put to bed, while the mother goes
about as if nothing had happened ; that
Tertullian, a cheerful early Christian writer,
remarked that woman was janua diaboli — the
devil’s front door; that Chateaubriand says
if you give a young girl her choice, Adonis or
Hercules, she will blush—and take Hercules ;
that a sculptor has said the breasts should al-
ways live at enmity—the right should look to the
right, and the left to the left; that, relatively to
height, in women the head is longer than in
men, the neck shorter, the trunk longer, and
the legs and arms shorter; that crooked legs
are a conspicuous aesthetic defect in woman
(which is probably the reason why Miss Squeers
was so enraptured with Nicholas Nickleby’s
beautiful, straight ones) ; that women are lead-
ing the movement to rob the little toe of a
joint—not being game to hit a toe of their own
size ; that the backbone is getting shorter, and
the Dibbs of ten thousand years hence will only
have 23 vertebrae, instead of 24, as at present;
that woman’s body-weightisto man’s as 83 to 100,
her height as 93 to 100, and her brain-weight
as 90 to 100; that men are more sensitive than
women, though less affectable—they see better,
smell better, and feel more—their taste is less,
and hearing is doubtful; that men are less
awkward than women ; that in the solitude of
the Australian bush one finds repeatedly that
while the settler is embarrassed and silent, or
scarcely able to utter more than monosyllables,
his wife is comparatively fluent and in pos-
session of a fairly rich and precise vocabulary ;
that women are more industrious but less in-
telligent than men, have better memories and
worse judgment, see parts better than the
whole, facts than the law ; that women need
less air than men ; that while a basso need not
fear any kind of excess so far as his voice is
concerned, a tenor must be extremely temper-
ate ; that little girls get hungry oftener than
little boys; that “ souvent femme varie ” is a
physiological fact and not a caprice ; that
married women dream less than un-
married, and men sleep sounder than
women ; that a man who administers anaesthe-
tics to a woman should always have two unim-
peachable witnesses; that noise and depravity
are much more common on the female than on
the male side of an asylum ; that the mixture
of heaven and hell in woman are different sides
of tlie same thing, and if you cut off the devil’s
tail you shear the angel’s wings ; that men are
better sculptors, painters, musicians, and writers
—women better actors ; that Scotch women are
the most criminal in Europe ; that in the saying
with which Goethe closed his “ Faust ” lies a
biological verity not usually suspected by those
who quote it.
* * #
The final statement is the keynote of Mr.
Ellis’s book. It was written with the a priori
view of showing that “das ewig-weibliche
ziebt uns hinan ;” and that when Paul said
“ the head of the woman is the man” he was
wrong, when Tennyson said “ woman is the
lesser man ” he was wrong, when Spencer said
“ woman is undeveloped man ” he was wrong.
The author has marshalled an immense number
of facts, but, unfortunately, most of them oppose
his theory ; and though he easily comes to his
foregone conclusion, the verdict is against the
evidence and the weight of evidence. So far
from woman leading, she is characteristically
the following sex. All progress is due to males
—they are the energetic variants; women
merely conserve and perpetuate the steps in
evolutionwhich men have won. Ellis remarks
that “ not only by his large brain, but by his
large pelvis, the modern man is following a
patli first marked out by woman,” though how
the possessor of a larger brain can follow the
possessor of a smaller brain when the relative
d.fh reuce is increasing, it is not easy to show.
The evidence goes to prove, on the other hand,
that mile and female brains were originally on
a relative equality, and that the male brain
grows continually larger and more complex,
while the female brain grows relatively smaller
and possibly less complex. As to the pelvis, that
is large in woman because some variable pre-
historic man took it into his head to become
a being erect on two legs (like that which
seduced Mrs. Bardell), and woman had liter-
ally to live up to him. But so essentially con-
servative is she, so slow to improve, that her
pelvis has not increased quickly enough, and at
the present moment it is hindering the progress
of the race. The boys with the biggest brains
die in infancy; the girls and small-brained
boys are easily born—which is the reason why
priests and monarchs are so well supported,
“ true mateship” is so scarce, and “socialism in
our time” is such an empty dream. Wait till
the backward female pelves are as highly
evolved as the progressive male brains, and the
millennium may begin. Only das ewig-weibliche
retards it.
« • •
Mr. Ellis’s statement that the infant is
higher in the line of evolution than the female,
and the female than the male, is mere fanciful
assumption. The adult male produces the
infant, not the infant adult males; and the
evolution of the infant depends chiefly upon the
variation of adult males. How, then, can it be
said that the infant, the effect, is higher in the
line of evolution than the cause—i.e., typically,
not chronologically? “Man, in carrying on
the line of evolution, started, not from some
adult male simian, but from the infant ape, and
in a less degree from the female ape.” What,
but the variability of the adult male simian,
gave to the infant ape the power to start man ?
Woman is the primitive sex physiologi-
cally ; and man has grafted his special
qualities on hers, losing something but gaining
more. The race, as the individual, is born from
her—the man is by the woman ; but, in evolu-
tion, the woman is of the man. She is his
echo, the shadow of his predominant charac-
teristics. He goes and grapples with the uni-
verse and selects such variations as aid the
progress of the race ; then returns and pours
into her lap, sitting at home, the wealth which
she doles out as needed. When a boy is playing
at marbles, the mate who “picks up” is nearly
always inferior in skill. Woman is the picker-
up of race-variations for the male player, and
she can rarely play as well herself. The play
of sex is analogous to the play of force
and matter. Probably force and matter are
one—so was originally sex. The object of
division is to give variation, which means
progress. Force is active, matter passive ; and
again the sexes are typified. The power of
motion is the essential factor in progress ; hence
the more active sex is always a bough higher on
the tree of evolution. But from a truer point
of view there is only sex-difference, not sex-
inequality ; since one is the complement of the
other, and neither can develop alone. Both are
among the innumerable manifestations of
those laws unknown and unknowable, which,
for want of a better title, men call God.—

While sticking to the saintly cent }
But, no, it must not be.
To bear the present dose is tough ;
What ? Clerical-cwm-lay ?
The Sunday hee-haw’s quite enough
Without a week-day bray.
Let neuter genders keep their set,
Incant their neuter spell;
Let males rule earthly things, and let
The third sex stick to (missing word).
Says a Samoan war correspondent : “On
Saturday night the Aana rebels fired upon a small
Government party engaged in prayers. The sup-
posed loss on the Government side is two killed
and four wounded.” This is the sort of thing
that knocks the stuffing out of missionary teach-
ing, and sends the disgusted savage howling back
to unregeneracy and idol-worship. Cromwell’s
alleged maxim : “Trust in God and keep your
powder dry,” was built half for show and half for
use. If the Samoan rebels stick to the use half
and the Govt, troops to the show half, the rebels
will soon be Govt, troops. There never yet was a
prayer fervent enough to stop a bullet.
Norman Cameron, landholder, beaten in
the Deloraine (Tas.) election by Jonathan Best,
butcher and local preacher, was not satisfied with
his defeat, and threatened to dispute Best’s right
to a seat, on the ground of intimidation during-
the election on the part of the successful candidate
or his agents. Cameron has a spice of the bull-
dog about him, as those who witnessed his battle
with Gloster Picket, of Chudleigh, some years ago
can affirm. After three-quarters of an hour’s
slogging the Bentley man acknowledged he had met
his superior, but Picket was in hard fettle whilst
Cameron was just off the grass. Apropos, Father
Murphy, of Deloraine (Tas.), rather astonished
his audience on a recent Sunday, after morning
service, by throwing aside the ecclesiastical robes
and treating them to an animated discourse on
the evils of land monopoly. Best got in on the
R.O. vote.
Victorian Commandant Tulloch lately en
tertained the Tory lights of Melbourne with a-
second-hand lecture upon Russia’s advance towards
India, the prophetic portion of the Major-General’s
deliverance being based on the blind old military
assumption that Russia’s political state is immu-
table, and the Czar’s miserable subjects will groan
under a military system for ever. The mind of a
Tulloch rejects all thought of a social advance in
Russia itself. The present despotism is eternal
according to the gospel of professional sojerdom,
and so Russia will continue to “creep” and
“creep ” onwards unless Great Britain takes Tul-
loch’s advice “that any deliberate infringement
of the boundary-line as now established shall be
considered a casus belli.” Strange to say he
doesn’t anticipate a casus belli in the near future,
which is a matter for alarm, because these epau-
letted gentlemen seldom fail to sniff danger except
when danger is under their noses. The only
humorous features of Tuiloch’s Imperial enter-
tainment were on the face of M. Pontiata, the
Russian Consul, who sat around disguised in the
ghost of a Tartar smile, whilst the lecturer was
imploring the British Lion to keep its tail cooked.
Federation —"Under the Crown.”
(A BATTLE HYMN.)
They say that we Australians are of cold and
sluggish blood ;
That we only love the racecourse and the rolling
football’s thud ;
But the time is quickly coming when we’ll have to
make a stand
For our “leaders,” lads, are in it, and they want
to sell our land.
There’s to be a Federation, and they can’t deny
this, lads,
“ A great Australian army ” and a fleet of iron-
clads ;
Some British Prince will let us lift our hats and
loudly cheer
When he comes from “ Home ” to rule us for ten
thousand pounds a year.
There’s to be a new-born “ nation ” with its mimic
Court and king .
That will daze our knighted leaders with the titled
host they bring.
Is it still the sad old truth, lads, to be always so
on earth.
That a man is king and noble by the accident of
birth ?
Or is it all a fable that will pass and surely die ;
In the Old World still a “ symbol,” but for us an
outworn lie ?
You are called to give the answer, lads, at every
risk and loss,
“The noble man must prove his claim beneath
the Southern Cross.”
There’s to be a Federation “for the purpose of
Defence;” .
Some question we know nothing of may bring the
war-dogs hence. . t
We won’t have any vote, lads, but they tell us it s
all-right,
“ You find the ships and arm your men; we 11 tell
you whom to fight.”
They talk to us of “ Empire ” and the glory that
it brings,
But, looking round, in times of Peace, we’ve seen
the strangest things—
A woeful lack of glory on the pinched and pallid
face,
The pride of Empire ending with a starving,
desperate race.
We have listened to their broken prayer, and
seen their outstretched hands,
And, oh! their eyes were turned towards the latest
of the lands,
And, whilst we waited for a sign, the millions’
stifled moan
Was broken by a warning voice that .whispered,
“Stand alone!”
It has come to us, this message, in its own wild
stirring strains,
In the language of the fierce hot wind that sweeps
our boundless plains;
In the sullen, silent ranges, when with crash of
falling trees
The clearer light illumes the land, it bursts upon
the breeze.
Will you sing the old, worn anthems? —ye who
know of one so grand,
That the soul of him who hears it is for ever with
this land ?
Will you cling to deadened symbols, graven images
of stone,
Or with wider reverence learn to love and under-
stand your own ?
Shall we tell them, lads, it’s hopeless, that we fain
would find the track,
But the dense, thick scrub and dark’ning range
have turned us sadly back ?
Are you going to stop disheartened—ye who’ve
pressed on in the van,
And cut your way through country never trod by
foot of man ?
They are listening, lads, across the seas, and well
they understand;
They will know to what we’re “ loyal ” when they
see us axe in hand ;
They will cheer us on our journey, ring us out
with joyous chimes,
They will know it is no parting, that we’ll meet
in happier times.
And in the days of doubt and gloom, when all
seems drear and black.
We will see the God of Nations, lads, a-standing on
the track 1
He will pass with light’ning speed ahead, and
blaze each passing tree,
He will lead us to the distant scene we do not
ask to see.
He will make a sign : in silence we will push on
through the dark;
He will raise his hand, and, listening, the whole
wide world will hark ;
He will tell the joyous tidings of a new land in its
birth,
A Christ amongst the Nations / bringing hope to
all the Earth.

In Melbourne, about a month ago, com-
positors’ pay was reduced |from Is. Id. to Is. per
1000, and on both Age and Abgus the salaried
hands were likewise retrenched. The other day the
Age proprietor informed his employes that the old
rate of pay would be reverted to, and also that
they would receive the amounts retrenched during
the month. The Argus men are—well, expectant.
The proprietors of that organ are awaiting Lino-
type developments, and the general manager has
been Sydney-wards inspecting the machines at the
Daily Telegraph office.
At the last Melb. tote-raid two establish-
ments were rushed by the police, and a splendid
haul resulted, 96 customers being arrested. The
catch was taken to the look-up in a long string of
cabs, the prisoners handcuffed in pairs. The tote-
keeper, whose establishment provided the prin-
cipal harvest, turned up shortly afterwards with
,£25 worth of stamps, with which to stamp the
bail-out documents, so that next year’s deficit is
already provided for. Most of the prisoners were
badly scratched with barbed wire, having got
themselves impaled on the Hebrew’s back fence in
their efforts to escape. The tote-man who puts
barbed-wire on his back fence plainly doesn’t
know bis business.
The wife of a certain ex-Maoriland knight
is reported to be indisposed, whereby hangs a
tale. The lady in question has been a social
failure of the first magnitude, and, despite her title,
she is so rarely mentioned that very few people
are even aware of her existence. So, at last—that
is how the allegation goes—she was fain to knock
her head hard against the wall, and then lie up
in bed and send round a notice setting forth that
she was indisposed, just for the sake of seeing her
own title in print. The poor little woman had
hardly so much as seen it in print before, and
didn’t know how it looked.
Ed. Bulletin, —Don’t bust, Mr. Bulletin,
over the curse of landlordism. True it is, that
C. G. Duffy is an Irishman, and that he was “ the
first to sow the dragon seed of Australian land-
lordism in Victoria.” True it is, also, that if you
transplant the Irishman to these provinces he
becomes a landgrabber, ready to add acre to acre
whenever he has the opportunity and the cash.
True, also, that when he becomes a landlord, he
is equal to his prototype of Ireland, and as great
a rack-renter. That being so, is it worth your
while to waste good ink in an attempt to make
the landocracy feel ashamed ? The most you can
do is to write, write, write, urging that not another
acre of your lands shall be sold as freehold. That
is what we are aiming for in Maoriland, and have
to a great extent attained. —W.U.
Victorian Labour Convention has adopted
a platform comprehensive enough to send one’s
forecast into the century after next Female
suffrage and one-adult-one-vote; referendum;
progressive tax on land values, exclusive of im-
provements ; cumulative tax on incomes over .£2OO
a year; tax on absentees ; continuance of protec-
tion ; State bank of issue; a law making eight
hours the maximum labour-day, “ wherever prac-
ticable;” a statutorily-declared minimum wage
for all labour employed on Government works;
establishment of a Department of Industry;
legally-constituted courts of conciliation and com-
pulsory arbitration; prohibition of Chinese and
other Asiatic labour and of “ workers under con-
tract” (?); a scheme of federation involving a
popularly-elected convention and a subsequent
referendum.
Editor Bulletin, —You have had a heap
of camel yarns; but nobody has told you that
there are as many breeds of camels as there are of
horses, from the little pony camels of Southern
Arabia to the big white Syrian beasts, measuring
10 feet or 11 feet to the top of the single hump, or
the heavy, long-bodied, two-humped camels of
Badakshan and Balkh. These last bear about the
same relation to the others that a Clydesdale bears
to a Cleveland horse. As for the “ original
African” camel ‘‘Randolph the Reckless” talks
about, I have always understood that all the
camels imported came from Karachi, which is not
in Africa. Seeing that most of the men concerned
in the camel business are Biluchis, it is not easy
to see why they should import the small, weak
African desert camels when they can get plenty of
better in their own country. Another little
blunder about the “aroma of coloured persons.”
The characteristic fetor of the negro is not
found among Asiatics. —J.R.
The opening at Pentridge of a new female
prison, to which most of the women previously
confined in the Melb. Gaol have been removed,
helps along the ancient agitation for the demolition
of the latter edifice. The site upon which it
stands is one of the best in the city, and has long
been coveted by the ever-watchful syndicate. It
is strange that during the land-boom, when
success would have been almost certain, the
agitators were silent. As an alternative to the
Gillies scheme of raising the wind by the sale of
the Kew Lunatic Asylum grounds, of which
Parliament approved in a special Act, a proposal
to sell the gaol site would have boomed. Looked
at now it was a marvellous dispensation by which
the prison was saved—at a time, too, when the
boomers were clamouring for the sacrifice of the
half-finished Anglican Cathedral so that its site
might be put on the market. Smellbourne’ s
gaols are used now much more than its churches.
General Debility.
The term General Debility means a depletion of
vital strength, a general break-up of the corporeal
health, due to over-consumption and wasting
away of the life-giving constituents of the blood
and nerve tissue, really a wearing out of the
animal structure. If your life is worth saving it
is worth your while to treat your case thoroughly.
If it is worth your while to treat your disease at
all, it is worth your while to continue the treat-
mentuntilyour health is thoroughly re-established;
you may feel all right after the first few bottles
of Clements Tonic, so prompt are its remedial and
curative effects; but a medicine, no matter how
good, cannot banish disease in a week, the seeds of
the complaint will still remain in your system and
break out afresh if you do not thoroughly eradicate
them. Don’t forget that a relapse is twice as
difficult to cure as the original attack, so if you
want to get cured give the remedy a fair chance
and recovery is certain. Clements Tonic is a
genuine article, it is prepared for a specific purpose
and contains the material to make it an effectual
remedy, and if used faithfully it cannot fail. We
do not claim it as a cure-all, we do not say it
will cure lock-jaw or bad spelling, but for all cases
of impaired vital strength it is a scientific and
infallible specific. Moreover, the cost of using
it is so small you can have a year’s course of
it for less than you can procure a week’s
medical attendance, and a tenfold better remedy
than any physician can prescribe for you.
Thousands of cases have been cured by
Clements Tonic, and it will cure you if you
give it a fair chance. Read the case of
Mr. John Sheridan, gardener, Katoomba, who
writes, Xmas, 1892 :—I have been a severe sufferer
from chronic indigestion for several years, accom-
panied by headaches, biliousness, extreme weak-
ness, and a general languishing depression, and
having been treated for same without success, I
was induced to try your Clements Tonic, and must
add my testimony to its great curative properties,
as after a few bottles I feel myself in every way a
new man. You can make what use you may
wish of this.—John Sheridan, botanical gardener,

In Absence.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The moon and a star hung in blackness above me—
The moon and one star,
And I thought of the friends far away, those who
love me,
Where sweet wattles are ;
Where swamp-oaks, with musical, mystical motion,
Sing low to the sedges
Who whisper the song to the river, the ocean,
Along the creek-edges;
Where grey gums stand stretching gaunt arms to
high Heaven
In piteous despair,
As ghosts who pray grimly from sin to be shriven
By priests of the air ;
While on the horizon the heat-ripples shimmer,
Deceiving the eye.
And blue hills in distance grow dim, ever dimmer,
And melt in bbrs-sky.
Deserted the homestead, ablaze with bright
creepers,
Its rough walls transfigured.
As Death glorifies the hard faces of sleepers
Who found Life a niggard ;
Deserted the stockyard, no echo remaining
Of muster-whips’ rattle,
The shouts of the horsemen, the dogs’ angry
feigning,
The groaning of cattle.
And phantoms long fled came in order completest,
Rough beards and burnt faces —
Ah, surely the pang of the Past is the sweetest
Pain’s pleasure embraces —
Clear eyes, that met mine with a gaze frank and
steady,
Revealing hearts true ;
Strong hands, gripping friends’ hands to show
they were ready
To dare all for you.
They passed, and her form filled the shadowy
vista—
She the moon, I the star ;
And my pulse leapt again as it leapt when I kissed
her,
Where sweet wattles are.
Then days of delight, when desires were all sated—
Attained the ideal,
When the universe seemed but a figment, created
To make rapture real;
And then days of doubt, days of anguish and
longing,
In Love’s bitter title ;
Then days of despair, when black demons came
thronging
And urged black requital.
The moon shone above me, enthroned in white
splendour—
The moon and no star ;
O, madman, could I in that bright sphere attend
her!
Better thus, better far.
A billow of clouds surged aloft, tnen another,
Extinguishing light,
And Earth nestled close to the breast of her
mother,
The infinite Night.

Pramama’s Prophecy: A
Malaccan Marvel.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Jt has in all ages been fortunate for the
prophet that mankind, in its craving for bara-
boozle, forgets to average results—remembers,
here and there, a hit; ignores the multitude of
misses
Mahometan and Malay by courtesy, the people
of tbe western Moluccas yet savour strongly, in
blood, tongue, and superstition, of the abori-
gbial races of the group. The gloomy witchcraft
of Gilolo—surviving imaum’s curse and Dutch-
lesi.l.tion-pMsesse. everywhere through-
out the other islands its female workers of for-
bidden wonders.
Pramama’s powers were great, said all men in
Klik. Within her proper sphere she was a woman
to be dreaded ; but, as for her predictions—the

survive the memory of her failures.
his bride. Two wives already had Jikar—hitherto
enough ; but, richer now by a lucky stroke in
pearls, he thought things would run to a third.
Which third was Fulsi—beautiful, from a Malay
point of view—substantially dowered, from any
point of view—and daughter of the chief of Klik
—Romongo.
Romongo it was who now held up his nng-
loaded hand. The gongs stopped all at once, and
jj kar>s vo , ce) by contrast with the clangour,
sounded like a child’s. But his words were a
man’s—pure, direct, and simple.
.< thank theej Father Romongoy-thee and thy
people! A good woman is the gift of Alla, and
Alla’s gifts are precious in the sight of Jikar.
Peace be with thee !—we go !”
“ Peace !” repeated a loud voice from without
the crowd. A man’s voice, Jikar thought, till
with the scared scattering of holiday sarongs and
bright bedangs he saw the speaker, a woman—
pramama i—for he heard the name passed round.
This, then, was the sorceress ! Jikar gently put
the veiled Falsi behind him and stood forth, the
upper extreme of the Malaysian race, as the fierce
virago that faced him was the lower. The Sibawi
chief, in snowy jacket and sarong, stood five-feet-
six—a very tall Malay. The sorceress, with but a
d j r t y re d chawat to hide her monstrous corpulence,
W as tall a 8 he—gigantic for a Malay woman. In
Jikar’s high, calm forehead appeared the Arab
B fc ra i nj as j n hf B shapely features, his easy dignity
of carriage. In Pramama’s beaky nose and close-
-Bftt eye a and faintly-crisping hair, the Papuan
affinity broke out, as in the blustering loudness of
her speech.
“Peace? What hast thou to do with peace,
thou mangy dog from Sibawi ? To my son was
this ff irl promised ! Take her, thou , and see
what comes of it 1”
Grey-headed Romongo blasphemed. “Pro-
mised ! Thy son !—she-beast!—accursed cow of
Sheetan ! The daughter of Romongo ”
From her dingy loin-cloth the sorceress took
suddenly an object that froze him into silence.
Only the skull of a snake—it was, to these Moluc-
cans—as to the Obi-dreaders of Africa —a thing of
ghastly possibilities. The people widened from
the witch like ripples from a stone, as, squatting
nimbly upon her colossal hams, she fitted the
skull upon a finger-tip and pointed with it straight
at Romongo.
The chief put up his arm as if to guard a blow.
“ What can I do, woman ?—they are married ! ”
“ Take her back ! ”
“H oy can I ? Married are they, I tell thee! ”
and Romongo’s voice rose nearly to a shriek as the
witch, with hideous leer and pointing finger, got
up and came slowly towards him. Then came a
collective gasp from the crowd, as Jikar, stepping
swiftly over, struck the fetish from the woman’s
finger and kicked it scornfully into the sea. In an
instant Pramama stood on the black basaltic edge.
The small white object, zig-zagging as it sank, was
still in sight, and with a tremendous souse the
witch went head - foremost after it. When,
with grampus-snortings, she came up again,
Romongo was vanishing amongst the sago-trees.
But him Pramama had forgotten. With fat
flanks heaving from her dive, she clambered out
and faced the bridegroom.
“ Take her, then,” she said between her gasps,
“to thy home—thine island of Sibawi. But one
night’s sail is it with such a wind as this. With
sunrise will ye be there— but no Sibaivi shall ye
find! Toman shall ye see, and Tarkat—but
Sibawi never more ! ”
• • «
It was a weird and unimaginable night.
Not stormy; steadily went the prahu before the
mild sou’-wester, powerless to raise a break upon
the sullen swell that set miraculously against it.
Like inky oil was the water —robbed of its phos-
phorescent sparkle as no man there had ever
before seen it. But, overhead, into a starless sky
came here and there a fitful gleaming as of molten
metal, while, all around, the circling sea-line
faintly marked itself upon a sickly greenish edging
to the upper gloom. Strange, far-off rumblings
came across the sea to Jikar’s trembling crew, and
“ Pramama !” went from mouth to mouth.
Jikar stood aft—steering—and thanking Alla
that Falsi slept. “ Else would she catch the
terrors of these quakers at an old hag’s babble !
What, now?”
The men—clustered forward in a muttering
group—had started into louder voice, and one—
thejuragan—called : “North-eastward, master!—
look ! look !” Beneath the foot of the inizzen
Jikar stooped, and looked.
Low upon the north-eastern heavens played a
lightning that changed its hue with every flash-
blood-red, steel-blue, and ghastly, vivid green.
Below this, after half-a-mmute, started out an eye
of crimson glare, that waxed and waned—went
out —then sprang again to fiercer life, as to the
watcher came, like thumps upon the heart, half-a-
dozen vast reports that shook the prahu from stem
to stern as if she had taken ground. Then Jikar
understood. “Again?” he muttered. “After
centuries !” Louder, then —“ It is *Makian, ye
fools!—broken out again at last!”
The men came aft, relieved. An erupting
volcano was, at all events, the known; a witch’s
curse was the iynotum pro terribile. But Makian
had not done with them. Cigars were glowing,
rice cooking, tongues wagging, when slowly
through the chatter rose a sound that stopped it.
“ A squall I”—and the men rushed to the halliards,
fore-and-aft. But the juragan—a, man of many
years and earthquakes bellowed, “ Touch
nothing, fools ! No squall is this !—it is the
earthquake-wave !”
He ran to Jikar at the helm. “Keep we her
head as it is, master. Stem on, there is little
danger ! ” Almost with the words the first wave
was upon them—unseen in that portentous black -
ness—but heaving the craft up, and up, till rolling
swiftly aft came a Bugis boy who had lost his grip
forward. Faster down the after-slope—a plunge
that nearly shook the spars out of her—then up
again and down—with smaller wave and smaller,
till, safe within the mighty arc, they slid once
more along the oily swell,

Pramama had “ fluked ” herself into fame—the
island had vanished.

Treasurer Carter is maundering once more
over his great scheme for converting the entire
Victorian debt, in one act, into an interminable
3 per cent, security. He thinks that, by making
the public creditor a present of £6,000,000, he will
be induced to effect the charge, and even with
this addition to the principal of the debt the
saving in interest would be .£286,000 per annum.
If the province will pass a law that this £286,000
per annum shall go into a sinking-fund for the
redemption of the debt, and that any Treasurer
who borrows the sinking fund, or suspends it, or
diverts it in any way from its purpose shall be
hanged, and that any politician who proposes to
revoke the law shall have all his property con-
fiscated and be exiled, then the addition to the
principal of the debt doesn’t matter much. But
otherwise it is only one more way of shoving off
the trouble until to-morrow.

“The East of Six”:
Tales of the Austral Tropics.
By ERNEST FAVENO.
With Prefatory Note by Rolf Boldreivood.
_ . . . - "" "
Opinions of tlie Press :
“ The volume takes its name from one of the Sketches, ‘ The Last of Six,’ though in point of merit they all stand pretty won 0.. .. t «u. xuc
author who is familiar with life in Northern Queensland, writes with vigour about the doings of the whites and the natives in these faraway
parts ’ A strong vein of mysticism runs through his narratives, and there are ghost s in almost every chapter, and for those who are fond of
realistic work the volume will prove attractive reading.”—S.M. Herald, July 8, 1893.

tip of cannibalism treachery, and revenge upon the dead, which in other hands might be gross and hideous, but which Mr. Faveac makes of
fhrilli ‘interest. '* The Haunt of the Jinkarras’ suggests Rider Haggard and his imitators to some extent, but is itself relieved from the
