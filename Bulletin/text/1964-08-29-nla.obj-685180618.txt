Come and see the timeless art of Holland’s
greatest painters - in Holland
(KLM will get you there-comfortably-in a day)
If you are planning a journey to London or anywhere else in Europe
why not take just a little time off to discover Holland? Flying by KLM, it
costs you no extra air fare. And the experience will enrich your life immeas-
urably. Amsterdam is one of Europe’s most modern historic cities. It is a
city of canals and bridges, handsome buildings, charming streets, world-
famous art galleries, good theatres and restaurants and well-stocked shops.
The cost of living here is lower than in any other major European city.
And the whole of Holland, with its amazing variety of attractions, is within
easy reach. Read some more good reasons for visiting Amsterdam, and
how KLM makes getting there such a pleasure.
Amsterdam one of the world’s great
art capitals. Amsterdam’s renowned
Rijksmuseum houses many tine works by
Vermeer, Hals, Jan Steen and other Dutch
masters of past ages. It is the home of
Rembrandt’s ‘Night Watch'. In the same
square stands the Stedelijk Museum of
Modern Art, with its collection of no less
than 170 paintings by Van Gogh. Easy
journeys take you to such fascinating
galleries as the Frans Hals Museum, Haar-
lem, the Mauritshuis at The Hague, the
modern Boymans-van Beuningen Museum,
Rotterdam, and numerous others with dis-
tinguished art collections. Admirers of Van
Gogh can enjoy the world's largest collect-
ion of his works at the Kroller-Muller
Museum, Arnhem, which is little more than
an hour by train from Amsterdam.
The whole of Holland sparkles with
beauty and interest. Holland is truly
called ‘the garden of Europe' and its
floral brilliance extends throughout the
year. The concerts of the Concertgebouw
Orchestra of Amsterdam, and other famous
orchestras, provide never-failing satisfac-
tion for the music lover. Other pleasures
include hunting down souvenirs, such as dia-
monds (surprisingly inexpensive), antiques
and curios, browsing through the old print
shops, taking a sight-seeing tour by canal
barge, sampling the open-air pleasures
offered by miles of excellent beaches, parks,
nature sanctuaries, lakes and countryside.
You enjoy traditional Dutch hospita-
lity right from the time you step aboard
your KLM jet. You can be sure of courtesy,
if*
comfort and fine cuisine, for KLM are the
modern Dutch masters of air travel A
KLM DC-8 jet leaves Sydney every Thurs-
day at 10.45 a.m. Melbourne passengers
can make a same-day connection. KLM
will have you in Amsterdam for lunch
on Friday, reliably.
Two of every three KLM passengers are
recommended to fly KLM by experienced

EDITOR
SCHOLASTIC EFFICIENCY
In his latest attack on the University
if New South Wales (15/8/64), Profes-
or A. E. Alexander, one-time occupant
jpl that university’s Chair of Chemistry
jnd now Professor of Physical Chemistry
it Sydney University, raises the question
jtl efficiency in running a university. He
suggests that there is no yardstick to
neasure this, and then proceeds to assess
that he calls the relative efficiency of
Cambridge, Sydney and New South
Vales. In his view, apparently, they run
!i that order, with NSW impliedly a very
oor last.
Putting aside the self-contradictory
ature of this mode of argument, it is
Still interesting to speculate whether the
(hesis he presents is true. Is it impos-
sible to measure the efficiency (relative
br otherwise) of a university? In total it
>robably is—but then this is true of
ilmost any complex organisation. There
s rarely an all-embracing, single measure,
'erhaps a few indications that might be
considered, however, are what it costs to
iroduce comparable graduates (in terms
>f student wastage as well as money);
contributions the university makes
jowards technical, economic and social
growth in the community; what needs in
the community, previously uncatered for,
it meets; how many highly trained pro-
fessional men and women it produces; to
pat extent it is willing to innovate,
i These are all pretty much practical
measures and are capable of being mea-
sured. Of course, they need to be con-
sidered, as Professor Alexander says,
relative to other universities, and they
tvon’t measure any more than a small
part of what a university should be doing.
But we would surely get a lot further
fising these sorts of yardsticks than by
Comparing an ancient, richly-endowed
English university and the oldest, pro-
bably best-endowed Australian univer-
sity, with a quick-growing, eager (but
poor!) 15-year-old stripling like New
South Wales.

ALP AND DLP
Sir,
Mr Jim Jupp’s letter (15/8/64) con-
tains a number of points worthy of com-
ment. He assumes, by inference, that
being a member of the DLP necessarily
precludes adherence to “Labor” princi-
ples. One wonders exactly what his cri-
teria are for banishing from the Labor
camp the many thousands of men and
women who still claim to be Labor
people and yet cannot bring themselves
to accept the ALP in its present state.
One wonders what the Labor “bounds”
are which exclude men like Frank Mc-
Manus, George Cole, Jack Kane and
Vince Gair, all prominent and loyal mem-
bers of the ALP before the “split” (the
last, for instance, being the Labor Pre-
mier of Queensland), and yet include
men of the calibre of Leslie Haylen,
Tom Uren, Dr Cairns, Mr Goldbloom,
F. E. Chamberlain, Bert Nolan, Frank
Waters, etc., etc. ... ad nauseam.
Mr Jupp also points out that Dr Knop-
felmacher “has now openly praised Mr
Santamaria and Sir Wilfred Kent-
Hughes” as though this were somehow to
relinquish one’s rationality. In noting
this sort of argument (i.e., that because
Mr X agrees with Mr Y then, per se, his
views are wrong) it can only be hoped
that Mr Jupp will, as a university lec-
turer, realise his intellectual responsibili-
ties when he participates in further dis-
cussion.

“TEA AT THE SWIFTS”
Sir,
Apropos Peter Hastings’ interview
with His Eminence Cardinal Gilroy
(15/8/64), one cannot help wondering
how the ratepayers of Woollahra like the
idea of subsidising the Cardinal’s resi-
dence in their midst to the tune of £5OOO
a year—especially the non-Catholics
among them.
E. P. MIDDLETON

THE MASS IN ENGLISH
Sir,
I heartily agree with the comments
made by the Rev. Dr Adderley
(15/8/64) who wrote of the confusion in
introducing English into the Mass. Not
only was there apparent confusion be-
tween the Liturgy Commission in Rome
and the Australian hierarchy, but also
among the clergy and laity.
In the first place there was a different
approach to the matter in a number of
dioceses —for example, the English ver-
sion of the Mass was introduced in Mel-
bourne at the beginning of July. In
some parishes supplies of the official
text were not available and the result,
with congregations reading from a vari-
ety of translations or possessing no prayer
book containing the exact prayers of the
Mass, chaos.
I agree that the official translation is,
in part, clumsy and, because of inac-

THE DFRB FUND
Sir,
Some considerable period of time has
elapsed since the last attack was
launched on the atrocious Defence
Forces Retirement Benefits Fund. It
now seems opportune to renew the
attack from a new and different angle.
I wish to draw attention to the DFRB
Fund as it affects officers of the Royal
Australian Navy holding short service
commissions. This group of officers
comprises the bulk of the aircrew of the
Fleet Air Arm. The commissions are
for seven years initially, and in some
instances four-year extensions are
granted as service requirements exist.
Officers holding these commissions have
undergone a training period ranging
from 18 months to two years, followed
by their seven-year commission, making
a total of up to nine years’ service in
the RAN.
Throughout their nine years’ service
they are required to contribute to the
DFRB Fund. At the end of his com-
mission each officer receives back exactly
the same amount as he has contributed.
He does not so much as receive bank
interest.
Subsequent to the Services’ pay in-
crease, contributions to the DFRB Fund
have also increased. Any person incur-
ring hardship in paying the extra amount
may apply to the DFRB Board to defer
payment of part or all of the increase.
The Board may or may not consent to
the deferment. If it does consent, the
contributor is required to pay compound
interest charges at the rate of 5 per cent
p.a. on the deferred amount.
The short service officer not only does
not receive any interest on the money
he has “loaned” the DFRB Fund, but
should he be forced to defer payment of
any increase of contributions he will be
charged compound interest on HIS
money. It is surely high time this
deplorable fund received official investi-
gation.

“A HARD DAY’S NIGHT”
Sir,
Allow me to tear down the walls of
your film critic’s Ivory Tower. Miss
Tivey’s review of “A Hard Day’s Night”
(15/8/64) smacks of intellectual snob-
bery. A critic has a responsibility to her
readers. She has seen the film. We
haven’t. She should review impartially.
Constructively. Informatively. Without
bias. We buy The Bulletin for
thought-stimulating, informative writing
Not for patronising, prejudiced
When Miss Tivey begins with her smut
little titter, “I'll admit that I’m 50 year)
too old to really appreciate tl|
Beatles . . .”, I begin to wonder if p er .;
haps she's 50 years too old to hold a pe t l
and think straight. *
She devotes two skimpy paragraphs ti(
a film that will have a long run at ever;
cinema. Yet she spends six long, dreari
paragraphs on a dull little New Wavt
tantrum that will have a two-week run i 5
an obscure art house, and attract ft/

perverts, who enjoy sitting in the dark tv
watch European cameramen extract;

FREEDOM?
Sir,
They say that these days London is
getting pretty much like Port Said (“Yol
like to meet mah sister, Sah? Verjl
cleen, very hygeen”); and when we hear,
the views of a certain type of English
intellectual, such as those of Professoi!
May (15/8/64), it seems likely to bt
true. As we all know, Australia is verj
unenlightened and very uncultured. Still,
it is young and relatively free from cor-
ruption (apart from what it imports)!
When an old and enlightened society
corrupts we learn what corruption
means; Austria before 1914, German;
before Hitler, England before —what? i
It is becoming increasingly evident
that the freedom that a good man}
academic liberals are most concerned to.
uphold today is the freedom to havj
schoolboys discussing the exquisiteness o'
“the homosexual agony”, the freedom tij
teach schoolgirls the techniques of left
bianism, the freedom to copulate in the
gutter. If they were less obsessed with
that freedom and as concerned as the;
pretend with the freedom to read the;
would want to do something about the,
situation where students “haven’t got •!
of a chance” of getting a book from the'
university library. A great deal of puK
lie money will be needed to rectify that)
situation. Is the Association of Teacher'
of Moral Nihilism and Total Depravity
going to launch a public appeal?

Why did Hanimex add
that ‘F to Praktica IV?
For Fresnal, firstly.
That’s the name of the optica! genius responsible
for the latest modifications to Praktica.
Mister *F’ has invented a new kind of grooved
screen view-finder. When you use it, you’ll see
how it concentrates all of the available light to
give a much brighter, sharper picture.
We could have called it a IVFF, actually, because
we’ve also added a new fingertip controlled split-
image range-finder.
Two new features:
1. Fresnal screen view-finder.
2. Fingertip controlled split-image range-finder.
Add these to the excellence of the Praktica IV—
and to its fully automatic lenses, its most flexible
range of accessories, its fantastic Hanimex world-
wide warranty and the finest of service—and this
justly famous 35 mm. camera is worth more than an
initial letter ‘F.’
The Praktica is a single lens reflex camera with
fully interchangeable lenses. Praktica offers these
features at only a little more cost than simple
range-finder cameras.
So it’s certainly worth a fast trip to your friendly
photographic dealer.
Here are the three models:
The Praktica IVF with f 2.8, 50 mm. Domiplan lens
. . . £39/19/6.
This quality 4-element automatic lens is hard coated
and colour corrected. The automatic diaphragm opens
and closes as the shutter is released and the film
transported to the next frame.
The Praktica IVF with f 2.8, 50 mm. Tessar lens
. . . £49/19/6.
This famous lens is fitted with a depth of field
preview button and fully automatic diaphragm.
The Praktica IVF with f 2, 58 mm. Zeiss Pancolor
lens . . . £59/19/6.
This 6-element lens is the finest of its type in the
world—has every modern optical innovation incor-
porated, to produce a lens limited only by the film
used.
Leather Carrying Case . . . £5/10/0.
Praktica Cameras are available from Hanimex dealers
everywhere—or write to Hanimex, P.O. Box 57,
Brookvale, N.S.W., for free leaflets.
For only 39/6 you can obtain from all dealers the
highly informative handbook “The Praktica System of
Photography.” A “must” for all Praktica owners.
Remember, Praktica offers you the largest range of
interchangeable lenses and accessories in the world.

HELPING COMMUNISTS?
Sir, (
Your issue of August 15 features His
Eminence Cardinal Gilroy. He declined
to discuss politics, but in the same issue
an article by Alan Reid in “This Austra-
lia” raised a moral issue on which he,
and the other bishops, should at las!
speak up. Before posing the question, ilf
is assumed that the Australian hierarchy,!
so loyal to Rome, does not reject Rome's/'
ruling (given by Pius XII in a more
definite ruling than his ruling againsi
anovulants) that it is morally wrong, i.e„
sinful, to vote for a political party which
helps Communists to achieve power.
It becomes, then, a question of facti
i.e., whether a particular political parti;
does help Communists to achieve power.
Previously, the Cardinal has declared the
Catholics were free in conscience to vot
for any party here except the Communis
Party. In effect, his declaration was
judgment that the ALP was not helpin
Communists to achieve power, s
judgment that is endorsed by the “neutral
lity” of Dr Simonds, since he could no!
be neutral on a moral issue. This
judgment of facts by the Cardinal hi
outweighed the judgment of those bishopj
who judge to the contrary. Moreover!
it has provided a loophole for the coni
sciences of those Catholics who, often
from personal experience, formed tk
judgment that the ALP was in fact doinij
what the Cardinal declared it was no!
doing, helping Communists to achieve
power. They shifted their moral respond
sibility to the shoulders of His Eminence
and continued to vote and work for thd
ALP.

Falling coal is sharp and abrasive.
That’s why tough metals are needed
to carry it. Coal is also corrosive.
That’s why a metal like Australuco
aluminium is needed.
These coal chutes at Queensland's
Bulimba ‘B’ Power Station are prime
examples of aluminium's versatility.
They have to be tough, and they
have to last with a minimum of
maintenance and upkeep.
Aluminium, of course, will last. It
won't rot or rust, and it needs no
painting for protection. It is ex-
tremely resilient, and stands up to
the toughest treatment. And, being
light, it is easier to install than
heavier metals.
These are all good reasons why the
Southern Electric Authority specified
aluminium from Australuco, whose
technical design work assisted in the
development of the boiler chutes.
They’re reasons, too, why a long
service life is confidently predicted.
Australuco’s engineers and tech-
nicians, backed by the world-wide
experience and knowledge of the
parent company, Alcan, are able to
supply the latest information about
the many applications of aluminium
in all phases of Australian industry.
Perhaps Australuco can help you?

National Notebook
, Miss Kitt and the
Color Problem
' When we saw Miss Eartha Kitt one
morning last week she was dancing
energetically in the deserted Spade Room
of Sydney’s Chevron. She eventually
sauntered to our table and over a cup of
coffee gave her views on race relations.
“I’m sick and tired of the way the United
States is criticised over race relations,”
she said. “We don't try to hide the prob-
lems and we are trying to do something
about them. You Australians have even
worse race relations with your Aboriginal
people and you won’t admit it. You
just killed them and then shunted
them off on to reservations. Why don't
you educate them, give them jobs, feed
them properly? They look half-starved.
Why don't you encourage your Aboriginal
artists? Australia has practically no ar-
tists, writers or musicians. Whoever heard
of a famous Australian author? You
can't name one. My God, where would
you be without Dobell? And that Abo-
riginal artist Nimmityji . . .?” Namat-
jira? “Yes. Well look what he did for
Australian culture. Put it on the map.
And then look at what you did to him.
Australia needs some racial mixing. Aus-
tralians all look alike, talk alike and dress
alike. They have no precise character, if
you know what I mean.
“By the way, New Zealand is as bad as
Australia on race relations. When I was
over there God it’s dead they said
that they took the brightest Maoris and
gave them education. ‘Well,’ I said, ‘do
you take the brightest of your New Zea-
landers and give them an education? Of
course not. They get it anyway’.” Did
Miss Kitt have any particular solution
for racial problems such as these? She
did. “Intermarriage. The children of
mixed marriages are so talented and
vital. Look at the children of white-Negro
marriages. Bright, intelligent, vital. Why
in America I don’t believe there’s such a
thing as a pure-blooded Negro anyway.
They’ve all got a touch of white anyway.
Look at Rio de Janeiro, what a wonder-
ful mixed race place that is, a mixture
of Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Indian
and Negro, wonderfully talented and vital
people.” She paused to fix us with her
glittering, defensive eyes. “There's a
wonderful time coming in America when
there’ll be true racial tolerance. Everyone
js becoming much more aware of the
problems. It's just beginning . . .”
The Long-Distance Runner
;JJomeward Sydney travellers who get
: off the Sydney North Shore train
at St Leonards every evening at 6.20
a re used to seeing a runner, generally
alone, flash through their midst on the
pavement outside the station entrance.
Punctual as a satellite he comes over
the horizon down the hill from Crow’s
Nest, sweeps past the station and the
Royal North Shore Hospital, and in no
time has disappeared into the darkness
up the highway towards Artarmon.
Running with a swift, light-footed
action, he looks as if he would never
tire.
The athlete is Bob Vagg, 24, who
will run for Australia in the marathon
at the Tokyo Games in October. Last
week we went to see him at the office
of a Sydney financial journal of which
he is an editor, and talked to him about
his preparation for the Games. Vagg
looks so young for his age, and is so
lightly built (he weighs 9st. 101 b.), that
for a moment we thought we must have
the wrong man.
He told us that he starts his nightly
training from Willoughby Park, not far
from his home at Castle Cove, runs via
the Eastern Valley Way and Miller
Street to Victoria Cross at North Sydney,
then up the Pacific Highway to either
Lindfield or Killara, depending on how
he feels. In about an hour and a half he
covers 12 miles, often, he said, with a
mind still full of stocks and shares.
Besides this he goes for a run of about
four miles three or four mornings each
week. “It’s a question of whether I
wake up early enough,” he said. “I
don’t like running in front of the neigh-
bors.” Altogether he is training 100
to 115 miles a week.
Vagg told us that he started running
mile races when he was 14, three-milers
at 17, and six-milers at 18. He has been
NSW 15-mile champion for the past five
years. He ran in his first marathon at
the 1960 Olympic trials in Melbourne,
and pulled out after 18 miles of the
standard 26 miles 385 yards of the
course, feeling that he would never try
it again. However, in 1961 he entered
for the NSW title, and on this occasion
pulled out after 20 miles. When he
won the 1964 NSW title last June over
the Botany course in 2 hours 28 minu-
tes 43 seconds, it was the first time he
had ever run the full distance. “The main
point of going in was to see if I could
finish,” he said. In July he gained
Olympic selection and won the Aus-
tralian title in 2 hours 24 mins 6 secs.
World times are about 11 minutes inside
this; but, as he pointed out, “Times don’t
mean much in the marathon. Conditions
and tracks vary so much.”
We remarked to Vagg that the mara-
thon had always struck us as a terrifying
race, with human performance pushed
to such limits of pain. This layman’s
observation rather amused him. “I think
the whole business is overrated,” he said.
“If you’ve done the work the distance
shouldn’t worry you. The real killer is
hot weather.” He was reticent about
prospects for Tokyo. “I haven’t had
much experience of marathon running
yet,” he said with a smile. “But I’m
there to do my best. If I finish in the
first 10 I’ll be pleased.”
The Minstrels Shuffle Off
a long session, the Black and
White Minstrel Show has shuffled
off the stage of the Tivoli, Sydney, and
headed for Adelaide.
The success of the Black and White
lay, according to Keith Leggett, the
show’s minstrel and ballet director, in
three things: “Lots of color, lots of girls
and all the old songs.”
“There is another thing,” he added.
“The show doesn't have a message.”
After Adelaide, the Black and White
minstrels will go to Perth and Brisbane.
“And that’s about as far as our plans
go,” Mr Leggett told us. “But you never
can tell. There is some talk of going to
Japan and even South Africa. I don't
think I’m over fond of the idea of going
to South Africa, though. They would
probably make us all sit in the back
of the bus.”
The number of people who have seen
the show in Sydney and Melbourne
(where it played for only eight months)
cannot be accurately estimated because
many have returned for a second helping.
“Some of them come back more than
once,” Mr Leggett said. “There’s one old
dear here in Sydney who seems to be
in the same seat every matinee. She
must have seen the show 50 times.”
A new Black and White Minstrel Show
has opened in London and will, according
to Mr Leggett, come on tour to Australia.
Off the Air
fpHE serious decision to raise airline fares
A by six per cent was finally made
toward 9 p.m. on a recent Monday night
in Melbourne. The first thing to do was
to advise all the newspapers, radio and
TV stations. The TAA directors wondered
for a moment about Reg Ansett’s new
station ATV-0. Then they decided as


a matter of courtesy they had better
advise the Channel 0 news service.
It was just as well they did. Glory
be, Channel 0 didn’t know a thing about
it. So there you are, it is comforting to
know that operations are being kept
separate and the right television hand
doesn't know what the left aviation hand
doeth.
Lots of Value
Tn recent years, Melbourne has seen
some marvellous auctions. The
Nicholas auction, for example, was a
beauty and we remember the Emmanuel
auction with real affection. Last week we
saw the auction of Lady Myer's furnish-
ings at 7 Towers Road, Toorak, right in
the heart of good auction territory. It
wasn't the greatest auction ever but for a
nice overall level of prices it was as good
as anything we have seen.
Lady Myer, widow of the late Sir
Norman Myer, has gone to live at Mt
Eliza. Naturally, a large portion of
Toorak didn't miss this opportunity to
have a look. At one stage there were
nigh on 400 people in the house. It was
so interesting a meeting, with such a
good cross-section of Toorak on show
at that hour of the morning, and the
conversation level was so high, poor
Mr Graham Joel was in a state of des-
peration trying to hear the bids.
Indeed, he even had to put a sign out
in the garden warning that any person
caught stealing the flowers and shrubs
would be prosecuted. You could see
his point. The quality camellias at
11 Towers Road looked particularly
fetching.
The “magnificent boudoir grand piano
by Bechstein” went for £B7O. A “luxuri-
ous down-filled settee” went for £290 and
a sterling silver chocolate pot with spirit
lamp earned another £l9O, to say nothing
of a set of entree dishes at £l2O and the
Louis XVI style cabinet at £350. All in
all, 220 lots were worth about £9OOO
and, as someone reported, it was “a
very nice Myers’ sale”.
Perhaps the most interesting item of all
was “a mahogany folding roulette table
and wheel with counters” which went for
£4O.
Taking the Plunge
Bulletin has been waiting with
A some interest to know how the bra
trade, one of Australia’s most vigorous
industries, would cope with the alarming
trend in fashions. Surely this sort of thing
could be the ruin of the figure-forming
folk. But now the problem has been re-
solved. We have seen the advertising
copy for the latest creation: “It’s the
bra-in-two-minds that’s decollete or top.
less according to your mood or the
swoop of the neckline you wear. The
most glamorous and most practical
answer to the neckline trend. Foldsi
prettily in an instant from decollete toi
topless.” No doubt about it fashion
lines are plunging.
“But (Hickory’s) clever little going,
going-gone bra gives you the privilege
of deciding how far to go and when,
You please yourself where the see-linet
ends just by folding the pretty little,
sheer fichu top. And, of course, ‘going-
going-gone’ still has (Hickory’s) own
‘bubble-cup’ for high, proud, rounded
loveliness.”

PLAIN ENGLISH
The Protestants, the Syllabus,
and the Schools
"Oefore some of NSW’s Protestant
** churchmen get any further car-
ried away in their competition to
say the worst possible things about
the new NSW syllabus for general
religious teaching in primary
schools, they would be well advised
to consider what harm they are
doing themselves. If anything were
calculated to drive the vast majority
of parents to support the Minister
for Education, Mr Ernest Wetherell,
it is the absurdities proclaimed about
his insulting Christianity and want-
ing to force clergymen out of schools.
One begins seriously to ask just
what sort of syllabus would satisfy
these critics and whether they have
ever seriously considered the fact
that the State schools are open not
only to Protestants but to Jews,
Catholics, Adventists, non-believers
and every citizen’s child, of what-
ever religion, who is of school-age.
The Public Instruction Act of
1880 was designed to meet this
situation, and how else can one
satisfy the Act’s requirements of a
“strictly non-sectarian” education
which includes “general religious
teaching as distinct from dogmatical
or polemical theology” (Section 7)
and which at the same time does
not offend the consciences of parents
of various religious faiths except
by general teaching of the ethical
principles shared by all major re-
ligions?
There may well be a case for
leaving this sort of vague, rootless
ethics- teaching out of the syllabus
altogether. It certainly adds little,
if anything, to a child’s education
and may suggest to some that in all
respects one religion is as good as
another. But the only thing to do
about that and it may be a course
worth considering would be to
change the Act and drop “general
religious teaching” altogether from
the secular syllabus, leaving religious
instruction solely to the clergy in
their religious lessons. But while
the Act stands, Mr Wetherell has
clearly adopted a syllabus which is
faithful to the letter and spirit of it.
The Protestant spokesmen who
defend the 1959 syllabus, which
made Christian dogmas not only a
part of the secular syllabus but an
examinable part, uncharitably over-
look how offensive it is to Jews and
how objectionable to many others
including post-Protestant sectarians
and agnostics. It was indignation
over this that led to the introduction
of the new syllabus. But we are yet
to hear one of Mr Wetherell’s critics
explain how he would solve, this
problem while respecting the Act.
Mr Wetherell deserves public
congratulation and support, and his
critics should realise that the State
schools are public, not Protestant,
institutions a fact which many
other Protestants and most Catholics
realised over 84 years ago when they
established their own church
schools.
Nauruans and Curtis Island
T'he breakdown of negotiations be-
A tween the Australian Govern-
ment and Chief Hammer de Roburt
over the resettlement of 2700 Nau-
ruans on Curtis Island close in-
shore between Rockhampton and
Gladstone was inevitable. The
Nauruans wanted more than any
sovereign power could possibly give
them, even a sovereign power as
conscious of its trusteeship oblig-
ations towards them as Australia.
Resettlement which in Australian
official thinking was obviously
aimed at assimilating the Nauruans
over a long period of time is a
difficult enough task in itself. In
addition the Nauruans wanted to
retain their own national identity
and sovereignty. They did not want
to be subject to Australian laws on
taxation, immigration or customs.
They were prepared to grant Aus-
tralia jurisdiction in the fields of
quarantine and defence and to
some extent in the conduct of ex-
ternal affairs. In all other aspects
this small Nauruan community
wanted in effect to create a sover-
eign nation on an island joined by
a causeway to the Australian coast.
One can sympathise with the
Nauruans. Behind all their demands
was the fear of communal frag-
mentation. Behind Australian
thinking was the sure knowledge
that resettlement of 2700 people,
no matter how humanely or con-
siderately carried out, must inevi-
tably result in assimilation. The
younger generation of Nauruans
would scarcely have wanted to stay
on Curtis Island content with fish-
ing, grazing and agriculture while
the continent of Australia with all
its opportunities and attractions
beckoned scarcely three miles away.
Communal exclusiveness and con-
tinuity were scarcely possible under
these circumstances. Chief Hammer
de Roburt’s attempts to secure com-
munal continuity were not only un-
acceptable to any sovereign state
but were barely realistic. The Nau-
ruan proposals would not have
guaranteed what they wanted most
cultural isolation and Aus-
tralia could not possibly accept a
foreign enclave in its midst.
The Nauruans are now opting
to remain on Nauru, take over and
mine their famed phosphate deposits
themselves, live off the royalties and
become an independent state by
1967. At first glance this seems an
admirably independent course which
might be encouraged. However, on
closer inspection, it seems impracti-
cable. The phosphate deposits are
steadily being mined out. Once they
are gone the relatively high Nauru-
an standard of living will dramati-
cally collapse and Nauruan
sovereignty with it unless shored
up by heavy injections of Australian,
British and New Zealand capital.
Perhaps an alternative island can
be found. Resettlement seems
inevitable, for a mid-ocean sove-
reignty for 2700 people without
an economy is an absurdity even in
these days.


THIS AUSTRALIA
THE PACIFIC
Nauru Says No
" Australia can jump in a lake ”
FROM ALAN REID IN CANBERRA
C. E. BARNES
“No dice”
T ast week 2700 Nauruans well and
truly “took the micky” out of Aus-
tralia. They informed Australia that,
while Curtis Island off the Queens-
land coast where Australia proposed
to resettle them when their small
Pacific island, in a comparatively
short time, is reduced to an expanse of
worked-out, and unworkable, phosphate
land —was “generally suitable as a place
for resettlement”, they did not want (a)
to become Australian citizens, (b) to be
subject to Australian laws on taxation,
immigration, customs, etc., or (c) to
risk losing their identity as a separate
and independent people. They were also
concerned about the opposition of some
of the people living at Curtis Island. They
therefore took the view that the Nauruan
people should stay on Nauru and not
resettle at all.
Australia is undoubtedly going to take
a drubbing over this at the UN. Aus-
tralia shares responsibility under a UN
Trusteeship Agreement with the UK and
NZ for Nauruan Administration. But
Australia was given the responsibility for
handling the Nauruan resettlement.
Australia tried to do the thing hand-
somely. It persuaded the Queensland
Government into agreeing that the suit-
able Curtis Island should be made avail-
able for Nauruan resettlement. The
Nauruans were to be given the freehold
of the island. A Council was to be
established which would consist of
Nauruans and which would have exten-
sive powers of local government. Addi-
tionally, at a cost estimated to be about
£10,000,000, Australia, New Zealand and
the UK agreed to meet the entire costs
of resettlement, including housing and
community services such as electricity,
water and sewerage. Pastoral, agricul-
tural, fishing and commercial activities
were to be started on the island. Aus-
tralia had some reason for feeling com-
placently pleased with its efforts.
But then a group of quiet, dark-
skinned men started appearing in Can-
berra. They conferred with Territories
Minister Barnes, their last series of con-
ferences starting on July 27. The upshot
of the conference is that the Nauruans
have* in effect said with considerable dig-
nity: “No dice”.
Where Australia will suffer is that
Nauru is the end product of another era
the colonial era. It belongs to a
vanished age when it was considered
right and proper that an alien people
should enter upon the land of a more
primitive people and use its products to
feed the industries, both secondary and
primary, of some distant country more
sophisticated in production methods. If
the use of these resources stripped the
country and left it unproductive, then
that was just too bad. That this age has
vanished is shown by the efforts the UK,
NZ and Australia have been prepared
to make to secure a satisfactory resettle-
ment of the Nauruan people.
Australia even was prepared to breach
its traditional immigration policy that
our migrant intake should be of people
from a similar culture so that the race
clashes that have occurred elsewhere in
the world should not be repeated here.
But the Nauruan people have exer-
cised their right and said, “No”. Unless
they can be persuaded from this position,
it is stalemate, and Australia is in for
trouble internationally. For although the
colonial era has vanished, at least as far
as Australia, NZ and the UK is con-
cerned, it is in the interests of those who
oppose the Australian, NZ, and
way of life to allege that the desire to
hang on to the remnants of colonial
practices still persists among us.
As I see it, the Nauruans, exercising
their undoubted rights to make decisions
on behalf of themselves, have put Aus- (
tralia in a spot from which it can ex-
tricate itself only by handling the Nau-
ruans’ fears and aspirations with thfj
utmost sympathy and delicacy.
Australia can take one wry consolation’
from the present situation. Here art)
2700 people telling Britain, Australia
and NZ, politely but unmistakably t(
“go jump in a lake”. If these people
were located elsewhere in the world
they might get very short shrift if theij
persisted with opposition to the wishes,
of powerful forces.
VICTORIA
Calling Off the Big Strike
But Bolte has sleepless nights ahead
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
"C'ighting fit after his sun holiday north
A of Brisbane, Victorian Premier
Henry Bolte last week entered the ring
against the Melbourne Trades Hall Dis-
putes Committee and scored a knock-
down —but not a knockout.
The unions warned that current
negotiations on wages and conditions
between them and the Bolte Government
would be off, if they proceeded with the
two-day strike scheduled for the opening
of the school holidays—withdrew their
threat unanimously.
The unions involved are those with
members employed by the Victorian
Government, which had offered to
negotiate on anomalies in wage rates,
alleged to exist between sections of its
services, but not on annual leave or mar-
gins. These, it said, were matters fol
wage tribunals wages boards and the*
Arbitration Court,
The two-day strike threat was a bit
to scare the Bolte Cabinet from the
stand.

Shop committees usually consist oj

bers employed in a particular worksho
or factory and their charter is to de:

Communist Party, some two years agi


through its trade union full-time orga-
niser, Jack McPhillips, decided that shop
committees should be influenced for
more extensive and political demands.
The success of the McPhillips Plan is
shown by the Victorian situation, where
the shop committees’ demands on annual
leave, margins, and “removal of the Bolte
Government” are now the demands of
the Trades Hall Disputes Committee.
This committee of two representatives
of all “Government” unions is dominated
by the United Front of ALP men and
Communists, now controlling Victorian
Labor. Its key personalities, L. Car-
michael, ‘secretary of the Amalgamated
Engineering Union, and J. J. Brown,
Railways Union, are both top Com-
munists. On vital decisions they control
the numbers. Hence withdrawal of the
two-day strike threat is a tactic only, and
Premier Bolte has sleepless nights still to
come.
What is there in the present Victorian
trouble for the Communist Party?
• The Communists believe they can-
not lose either way. Any concessions by
the Government go to their credit for
militancy. No concessions will antago-
nise the worker and make him rife for
more industrial sabotage.
• The shop committees enable them
to by-pass moderate union officers and
executives and present the Communist
Party's industrial and political demands
not only through Trades Hall Councils
but even through the ACTU.
• The continual pressure on newly-
elected Trades Hall secretary Mick Jor-
dan embarrasses him and his Right-wing
support, while the Left seeks the numbers
to remove him from office.
The position in the unions can only
be remedied by a powerful drive by
Labor to defeat Communist officials, but
Left-wing control of the Federal ALP
makes this unlikely. Therefore Premier
Bolte has no alternative but to dig in
and stand for arbitration. The late John
Cain, as a Victorian Premier, yielded in
the 1947 rail strike to similar demands
to those now presented. He learnt his
lesson and ever after refused to go out-
side wage tribunals.
RELIGION - I
No Room for God?
But “Love Thy Neighbor "
FROM GORDON CHESTERMAN IN SYDNEY
E. WETHERELL
Dancing?
\TSW Premier Renshaw, after holiday-
ing in Queensland like Victoria’s Bolte,
returned to Sydney last weekend and
found himself smack in the middle of a
controversy sparked off by Mr Wether-
ell’s new social studies syllabus for pri-
mary schools which separates the teaching
of ethics from the teaching of Christianity,
leaving religious instruction to the special
religious classes, and makes social studies
a non-examinable subject.
Mr Renshaw will probably meet a
deputation this week headed by Dr
H. R. Gough, the Anglican Archbishop
of Sydney and Primate of Australia, on
behalf of Anglican and other Churches.
The deputation will ask the Premier
whether the Minister for Education had
Cabinet backing or whether it was purely
an independent action by Mr Wetherell.
If the move is Cabinet-backed, the depu-
tation will ask that the wish of the com-
munity must be ascertained. If the
action is an independent one, the depu-
tation will ask Mr Renshaw what, if
anything, he intends to do about it.
Meanwhile the feelings of Protestant
clergymen, teachers, Jews, Catholics and
Humanists have grown considerably. Not
once in the NSW primary schools’
syllabus for religious teachings does the
word God appear, says Sydney Metho-
dist minister Rev. Alan Walker. “Pos-
sibly the next step by the Minister will
be the exclusion of clergymen from
schools,” he says.
Says the Rev. B. G. Judd, secretary
of the Council of Churches: “Mr Wether-
ell has always danced to the tune of the
Secular Defence Society—a small body
of militant unbelievers dedicated to the
elimination of scripture teaching.”
For his part, the president of the
Secular Education Society, Mr K. War-
gent, describes the new syllabus as a “new
breath of tolerance, high ideals and
commonsense.”
The NSW Teachers’ Federation also
fully endorsed the removal of scripture
from the primary school social studies
syllabus, according to its president, Mr
Sam Lewis, and certainly endorses the
treatment of religious teachings as a
non-examinable subject.
To Dr J. H. Hirshman, chairman of
the NSW Humanist Society, the new
scripture syllabus means a step toward
religious freedom and true democracy.
And what has the man responsible for
this controversy, Mr Wetherell, to say:
“I am confident the new syllabus will
become a potent influence in combating
child delinquency. The teacher will have
full opportunity to divert the child
mind from delinquent thoughts to
thoughts on good living.”
He strongly denied the syllabus ex-
cluded Biblical, moral and ethical pre-
cepts. “The syllabus merely excluded the
dogmatic aspects of religion. What
greater precept could there be than the
Christian injunction ‘Love thy neighbor as
thyself’?”
• Meeting Mr Wetherell, page 37.
RELIGION-II
“Terrorism”
“The Bible says we
will be persecuted ”
FROM A NEWCASTLE CORRESPONDENT
"C\)llowing reports on the northern
A coalfields that a Jehovah’s Witness
sect is “terrorising women and children”,
more than 70 residents of Weston, a tiny
mining centre, have signed a petition ask-
ing for police and Council protection.
Cessnock City Council referred the
matter to police who advised any re-
sident, upset by a sect member, to use
force to throw him out of their homes.
“If this fails they should contact the
police and we will take court action if
necessary”, said the officer in charge
of Cessnock police', Inspector J. Sewell.
Petition leader, Mr B. Hutchinson, of
Weston, said women in his township lived
in a constant state of fear. They lock
themselves behind doors and encourage
dogs to attack members of the sect. “Why
should any town be asked to put up with
this?” he asked.
But last week the verbal war took a
new turn when a Jehovah’s Witness
leader on the coalfields struck back. He
is Mr D. Dick, a Kurri businessman.
“Some of our ministers may be a little
over-eager to present the case of our
religion,” he said. “But if people are un-
interested we do not usually trouble
them. If reports of harassment are true
the position will be quickly rectified.”
Meantime some Weston residents have
set up precautionary measures to warn
the town of the sect’s approach. Young
children are posted along footpaths and
tell their parents of approaching
strangers.
To which one Newcastle Jehovah’s
Witness leader replied: “The Bible says
we will be persecuted for preaching the
word of God.”

Labor’s Caution Over “Peace” Front
Peking moves in
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
T ost sight of in the flare-up of hostility
between the NSW Labor Executive
and the Federal ALP Executive over
unity tickets and State aid to private
schools at last week’s meeting of the
NSW Executive, was a brief discussion on
the forthcoming pro-Communist Peace
Congress in Sydney late in October. It
had become generally assumed that the
ALP Federal and State branches, the
ACTU and the State Labor Councils were
active participants in the Congress. The
convenors of the Congress and some Left-
wing ALP members did little to contra-
dict this line of thought.
According to a cagey statement by
Dr J. F. Cairns (“ALP Journal”, August
1964), for example “there is no doubt
that there is nothing in the attitude or
policy of either body (ALP or ACTU)
that does anything less than encourage
their members actively to participate in
(the Congress’s) work”.
Labor as a whole, however, seems far
more suspicious of the latest Communist
front than this implies.
The discussion at the NSW Executive
meeting was aimed at clearing up the
NSW attitude. Assistant Secretary T.
Mulvihill stated that the NSW Branch of
the ALP was not condemning the Con-
gress, but it was not endorsing it either.
He “expected ALP members who did
attend the Congress to stand up and fight
for ALP principles as opposed to those
of the Communist Party.”
Further the ACTU is not sending a
delegate to the Congress, although Pre-
sident A. E. Monk will attend to explain
ACTU policy with regard to peace. Nor
is the Sydney Trades and Labor Council
sending an official delegate, although Mr
J. Kenny will attend and read a prepared
statement outlining that body’s attitude
relating to peace.
Recently both the Federated Clerks’
Union and the Amalgamated Society of
Carpenters and Joiners have clarified
their attitude on the matter. At a Clerks’
Union meeting on August 19, at which
the Communist Party made every effort
to have a majority of their members and
supporters, it was decided by 132 votes
to 92 that the Congress was Communist-
inspired and that no good purpose would
be served by the attendance of the FCU.
The ASCJ decided not to take any part
in the Congress. Other unions are ex-
pected to take similar action in the near
future.
There are persistent reports that the
Congress organisers are perturbed that
adherents of Pekinese Ted Hill’s CPA
(Marxist/Leninist) will attend the Con-
gress in force, with the express intention
of exposing the Muscovite CPA's and
Soviet manipulation of Congress. Proof
that there is some substance in these
rumors is gained from “Peking Review”
(17/8/64). After roundly condemning
the Soviet Union for splitting and sabo-
taging the Tenth World Conference
Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs
held in Japan last month, “Peking
Review” bluntly declares that “the Peace
Movement sponsored by the World
Council of Peace is under control of a
certain power.” (i.e., the Soviet Union.)
The World Council of Peace is the
motivating force behind the proposed
Congress and the same organisation to
which so many of prominent peace
partisans belong.
THE RETURN OF SIR HENRY PARKES
ffiJzSulCetCn
80 Years Ago: August 28, 1884
T HE return of Sir Henry Parkes is,
to some creatures, like the return
of summer. At the touch of his rays,
ey are warmed and quickened into
We and motion, and begin to squirm
and wriggle from their holes and
hiding-places, and to creep again un-
cannily before the eyes of a shudder-
ing public. On this Saturday, a public
banquet is to be given to the patron
saint of creatures of this kind. Names
which have been almost forgotten, and
which the people of New South Wales
would fain forget altogether, except
it were to point a moral and adorn a
tale, come into print again. Is it the
use that Sir Henry has turned his
gifts to, that the banqueters would fain
have our young men emulate? Are
they, as fathers, or as elders of the
people, desirous of saying, let your
Hf . his . be such man • r / ffard
f De as ms > De sucft a man in regard

B ard for your obligation; earn such a

the public records of your country;
be known, like him, for the self-
sacrificing devotion of your career;
come to be favored, like him, by the

among public men . . .
SPORT
The “Sleepers”
An opening for big money
FROM “DISCUS” IN SYDNEY
Amateur Basketball Association
is planning a stadium in Sydney, and
it s high time it did so. Recently a
Lithuanian-American team had to play
its Sydney matches in a boys’ high school
gymnasium, and hardly drew a crowd. A
basketball stadium in Sydney, with those
available in Melbourne, Adelaide and
Perth, would probably make more tours
by overseas teams financial successes, and
give basketball the impetus it needs.
The game has plenty of grassroots
support. Teams already established use
every available gymnasium, mostly high
school ones, and only a lack of venues
stops more teams being formed and in-
terest in the game continued beyond
school years.
This problem of venues is the main
one holding back several sports which
might otherwise have rapid growth as
spectator attractions. Baseball is a more
interesting game than cricket, but where
can it find summer grounds? Cycling is
an exciting sport to watch, but needs an
expensive stadium. Squash has a large
following, but no arena where it could
be watched by any large number.
The factor which could make a winner
out of any of the “sleeping” sports is the
big commercial money which is available
to back them if there is any chance of
extensive public interest. Some of this
money has already been spent on athletics
and soccer, on golf and on cricket. One
firm has established a foundation, with
£lOO,OOO a year available to further
sports. It has, for instance, sponsored a
winter school for cricketers in Perth.
Commerce’s money is there for sports
which can show at least some determined
activity. It may occasionally be offered
almost in charity, as it was to athletics
this year. The readiness to spend money
on “risk” sports is evident in commerce’s
willingness to help a very shaky starter
in soccer, allowing for the fact that the
willingness to accept is a factor too.
It’s a commercial age. Sports which are
afraid to compromise, and too witless to
promote, will be the forgotten sports of
tomorrow.

The Orr Case
Re-explodes
A hitter fight to the finish?
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
“/Ane hopes,” wrote Mr William Gin-
nane, secretary of the Australian
Association of Philosophers, in The
Bulletin last December, “that the Uni-
versity of Tasmania will receive a flood
of first-class applications when it now
advertises the Chair of Philosophy.”
The Eight Years War seemed to be
over. The University of Tasmania had
offered, and Orr appeared to have agreed
to accept, £16,000 in final settlement of
the dispute that arose between these two
parties when the University summarily
dismissed the then Professor Orr from its
Chair of Philosophy in 1956. Orr was
also believed to have agreed to withdraw
his libel action against Vice-Chancellor
K. S. Isles and not to apply for a position
in the University. At the same time the
Federation of Australian University Staff
Associations (FAUSA) agreed to lift its
censure on the University Administration
and its plans to advertise against the
University; and the Australian Associa-
tion of Philosophers (AAP), of which
Mr Ginnane was an officer, agreed to
lift its highly successful, internationally
publicised boycott of the Tasmanian
Chair of Philosophy.
Now, last week in Brisbane, Ginnane’s
AAP decided by 30 votes to one with
one abstention to continue its boycott,
and Mr Orr took action to issue new
writs totalling £200,000 against Vice-
Chancellor K. S. Isles, seeking damages
in Brisbane, Perth, Auckland and London
(in addition to the £50,000 claim already
issued in Sydney) for defamation in a
pamphlet published by Isles.
The December, 1963, settlement is as
dead as the dodo.
It began to become clear in April what
was afoot when Orr’s solicitors submitted
a draft agreement to the University with
a clause which was reported to allow for
Orr's reinstatement. The University re-
jected this in June and reaffirmed the
December agreement. Then in July Orr’s
solicitors dropped the reinstatement de-
mand and was reported to be seeking
what amounted to additional payment.
In August the University rejected this,
too, again reaffirming the December
agreement. Finally Orr renounced the
“agreement” and the AAP reaffirmed the
boycott and issued an 85-page yellow
book explaining why. They argue, among
other things, that the proposed agreement
committed them to conceding that the
case was closed in principle, and not
merely that a compromise has been
reached. They maintain firmly that Orr
was wrongly dismissed and that a real
agreement must accept this point, or at
least not commit the philosophers to
denying it.
The war will now continue with re-
newed bitterness on both the propaganda
and legal fronts. Orr’s writs for
£250,000 in five cities are a measure of
his determination; the philosophers’
yellow book of theirs; and for its part
the University of Tasmania, having once
made a gesture of conciliation, is now
prepared to fight to the finish, confident
no new agreement can ever be reached
and confident, too, of public support
against the philosophers whom they
charge with damaging the interests of
thousands of Tasmanian students, present
and future.

“The Cemetery”?
Next to the Asylum
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
HThe day after State Cabinet announced
that Victoria’s third university, La
Trobe, would be established at Bun-
doora, eight and a half miles from Mel-
bourne’s GPO, Mr H. Bolte’s sigh of
relief was more than audible.
He announced that the construction
of the new university, together with his
pre-election proposal to give technical
colleges degree status, would take the
pressure off any need for a fourth uni-
versity. In fact, he said the upgrading
of eight city and country technical col-
leges would be Victoria’s fourth uni-
versity.
Not everyone approved of this. The
head of the Education Department at
Melbourne University, Dr E. L. French,
pointed out: “Universities cannot be
created by the stroke of a pen. It is
one thing to give technical colleges
degree status and quite another to get
that status recognised internationally.”
Dr French said a university had to be
independent of Government control, it
had to be able to seek staff throughout
the world to keep up standards, and it
had to provide conditions for staff to
work and live as scholars.
As for La Trobe, it will take students
in 1967. It will have room to expand
on 500 acres of farmland near Mont
Park Mental Hospital on one side and
a cemetery on the other.
Already this has started speculation
that since Melbourne University was
-own as “The Shop” and Monash as
“The Farm”, it seemed likely that La
Trobe would become “The Cemetery”
or perhaps “The Asylum”?

VD Upsurge
in the West
Too many drive-ins?
FROM A PERTH CORRESPONDENT
An upsurge of venereal diseases among
West Australian young people has
shaken parents and prompted an official
analysis. Of the 390 cases reported last
year, 25 per cent were among the 15 to
19 age group, as against 6 per cent five
years ago. The trend has continued into
the first half of this year, with 201 cases
reported.
The official report, being prepared by
Dr D. J. Snow, a Scot and deputy com-
missioner of the Public Health Depart-
ment, sees “three quite simple reasons”
for VD regaining its wartime prevalence:
Increased excitation, increased oppor-
tunity for promiscuity, and reduction of
fear as a deterrent.
Dr Snow has an answer to the first
only.
He considers censorship (of magazines,
music and films) would eliminate many
dangerous stimuli. The sex drive, he
observes, is whipped up by “hot music,
jiggy dances, bikini calendars and films
with sexy themes . . . even Beatle music
has an elemental jungle rhythm”. He
cites, further, the car as villain of the
piece when it comes to opportunity; and
this opportunity is compounded by stim-
ulus at the drive-in. But so far Dr Snow
has no answer to these opportunities yet.
As for deterrents: “In bygone times
there was a terrible fear of VD,” he says,
“communicated to the young by their
parents who knew it could kill, maim,
drive you mad, or make you liable for
long and conspicuous treatment. The
fear of illegitimate pregnancy was only
slightly less intense. Girls were shunned
and whispered about if they became [
pregnant, and they found it hard to get
refuge.” Medicine has removed the first
deterrent, tolerance the second. What
can be done about this is also uncertain.
To these three simple causes, Dr Snow
adds the supplementary cause of cults
—“bodgies, widgies, mods, rockers . . »f
all, to some extent, irresponsible and with
sexual implications.” Like others deal- 1
ing with problems of the young, Dr Snowi
has been mystified by these cults.
He cites the case of one group which (
came to light when a GP in a middle-,
class Perth suburb reported a VD out- *
break. Dr Snow says: “In the sect con-1,
cerned, the female’s status is derived
from sexual performance. The girls were
called Mobbers, and queen of the Mob-
bers was the one who could take on the
most boys, as it were.” She was sweet
16 and her score was 20.


MEDICINE—II
The Board that
was Sacked
" Crucified for obedience ”?
FROM W. McCLUNG IN NEWCASTLE
The warring factions in the dispute at
the nationally famous Royal New-
castle Hospital are unanimous on only
one point —that the 38-year-old Admini-
strator, Kenneth Robert Boylan, will
need the wisdom of Solomon if he is to
restore harmony. The New South Wales
Minister for Health (Mr W. Sheahan)
has given him until February 28 to
demonstrate such wisdom and to heal the
breach that has split the Board and the
medical staff. Meanwhile moves on the
outside threaten to carry the fight into
political circles and possibly into Court.
Some of the 12-member Board were
not surprised at the drastic decision of
the Health Minister which dismissed
them from office. But they intend to go
down fighting.
Mr Sheahan has no argument with
them for the manner in which they did
their job. He has acted on the recom-
mendations of the three-man Hospitals
Commission whose chairman (Dr Selle)
has said that the dispute cannot be
allowed to jeopardise the future of the
State’s second-largest hospital—and, he
might have added, one of the country’s
greatest.
The Commission made its report after
a three-day investigation at Newcastle
during which it interviewed hospital
officers, the matron, Board members,
members of the medical staff and union
officials.
The dispute, which is rocking the city,
developed unnoticed by the patients who
are the main concern of the Commission.
Over a period it accelerated, with a grow-
ing intensity of the rift between members
of the Board supporting the medical
superintendent, Dr C. J. McCaffrey, with
whose name the hospital is generally
associated, and others who alleged that
the policy of the Board was not being
strictly observed.
The early simmering of trouble came
in a report on an inspection of the hos-
pital carried out in May by an inspector
of the Hospitals Commission. It was a
routine inspection, but the report caused
alarm at the increase in the fees col-
lected by hospital specialists for their
treatment of private patients within the
hospital.
But the major bombshell burst at the
hospital Board meeting on the night of
My 15 after a doctor under suspension
from the Ear, Nose and Throat Depart-
ment had claimed damages. He had been
suspended, without the knowledge of the
Board, for alleged unethical conduct.
Dr Doreen Birch, head of the Ear, Nose
and Throat department and the wife of
Dr McCaffrey, was questioned at the
meeting. Board members decided by
seven votes to four to reinstate the doctor
without loss of salary.
There was talk of resignations at this
decision and members of the Hospital
Employees’ union by-passed the Board
by wiring an appeal to the Hospitals
Commission. Unaware of the develop-
ment members of the Board were stun-
ned to receive a summons to meet mem-
bers of the Commission at the hospital
next day. The three members of the
commission, unable to complete their in-
quiry in one day, returned to Newcastle
for two days the following week. It was
their report that led to the dismissal of
the Board.
Meanwhile, on August 7, the doctor
who had been under suspension resigned
from Royal Newcastle Hospital and ac-
cepted a position offered on the staff of
a Sydney hospital,
Some of the dismissed Board members
have vowed that the fight is not over.
They claim that, despite the differences
that developed, the hospital is one of the
most advanced and highly rated in Aus-
tralia.
They point out that, when the delega-
tion visited Sydney on July 14 the Com-
mission advised Board members to re-
solve their own differences. Now they
are being crucified, they say, for their
only sin of carrying out the Commission’s
direction.
MEDICINE -III
The Doctor’s Story
Why I was fined £15000
BY DR BRIAN SPROULE
T run a large suburban general prac-
A tice in one of the less fashionable
suburbs of Sydney. Because of this
lack of fashion and also due to the
Geriatric flats built by the Housing
Commission in my area, a relatively
large proportion of my patients are
pensioners. Prior to- the Pensioner
Medical Services Committee of En-
quiry into my treatment of these pen-
sioners, they received treatment at
exactly the same level as my private
patients. Their night and week-end
calls claimed the same priority as was
shared by my private patients (even
though for an after-hours call the pri-
vate fee is two guineas, and the Pen-
sion Department pays 145.) But things
will be vastly different in my practice.
The enquiry began innocently
enough with a request from the Pen-
sioner Medical Department for details
of the clinical condition of the pen-
sioner patients under survey in my
case some 80-odd patients, their treat-
ment extending over a period of two
years.
The clerical work involved was con-
siderable, but I went along with the
bureaucrats and laboriously handwrote
details as far as I could. When my
Pension Department cheque failed to
materialise at the end of the month I
rang the Department and was told all
future payments would be withheld
until the Committee reported.
Several months later I was requested
by letter to go before a Board of En-
quiry. I was sworn in (“You can refuse
if you want to”) and then each patient
was minutely dissected and my medical
treatment commented on. I was in-
formed that I did not discourage
patients sufficiently. I was told that
it was a bad practice to have people
coming in for routine check-ups on
their blood pressure or duodenal
ulcers. When I replied that this was
standard procedure with my private
patients, the head of the Committee
maintained that how I looked after
my private patients was of no concern
to them, and that the same standards
did not apply to pensioners.
At the conclusion of several hours,
they quietly left, saying that I would
be informed of the verdict.
Again several months passed with-
out notification, and without pension
cheque. Then it came. A letter inform-
ed me that I had been fined £l5OO and
this would be deducted from my pen-
sion cheque. I requested, and was
given, an interview with the Director
of Health. He was quite succinct.
“You have committed no crime, Doc-
tor; your actions weren’t censured;
you were just too kind, Doctor.”
I was glad I took a tape recorder
at this interview.
Well, I don’t do routine calls on
pensioners any more. I send week-end
and night callers off to the local hos-
pital. I actively discourage pensioner
patients. Since my fine, three of the
pensioners on the enquiry list have
died. They used to be regularly
visited by me. Possibly they’d be

The Wall Street Backlash...
As helpful to Johnson as the white backlash to Golduater
From GEORGE McGANN in New York
While we have all been obsessively
concerned with the growing
“white backlash” the reaction
to Negro street rioting and other civil
rights demonstrations—what might be
called the Wall Street backlash has been
quietly building up in the skyscraper
canyons of this country’s most powerful
financial district. The Wall Street back-
lash is unprecedented, highly significant,
and might prove every bit as helpful to
President Johnson as the white backlash
is to Senator Goldwater in the swiftly
developing presidential campaign.
The Democratic nominating conven-
tion at Atlantic City, starting August 23
and ending August 27, marks the official
start of the campaign, but actually it has
been under way since the Republicans
nominated Barry Goldwater at San Fran-
cisco in mid-July. Selection of Lyndon
Baines Johnson as the Democratic Party
standard-bearer is automatic, since he is
eligible for election to the White House
for at least four more years. So the
Atlantic City gathering is being called
the “Vice-Presidential Convention”, with
all interest centred on the selection of the
President’s running mate.
The man most likely to be chosen is
Senator Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota,
an old-fashioned Middle West Liberal
and the hero of the long, bitter battle in
Congress which resulted in the passage
of the controversial Civil Rights Bill
against which Barry Goldwater cast his
dramatic “No” vote.
A few weeks ago a “Republicans for
Johnson” campaign headquarters was
opened in mid-town Manhattan, where
the businessmen and bankers who sup-
port the President might feel more com-
fortable than in the alien precincts of
Democratic Party headquarters. And
last Sunday the opulent seaside mansion
of Henry Ford 11, “Fordune”, at South-
ampton was the scene of a precedent-
shattering “LBJ barbecue” at which more
than 2000 Johnson supporters paid
25,000 dollars to consume Texas-style
spare-ribs, baked beans, sourdough
biscuits and gallons of beer, with all
proceeds going to his Presidential cam-
paign fund.
Goldwater win feared
‘ ' .
006 exc^us * ve eas f end of
Long Island could remember when a
Democratic Party gathering was held on
an estate comparable in size and luxury
f° Fordune. During the 1960 election
Mrs Ford, the recently-divorced wife of
fhe rnotor magnate, was a member of
Volunteers for Nixon” and worked
actively for the Republicans. But on
Sunday she and her daughter Charlotte
rubbed elbows with their Democratic
guests as if they had never cast a Republi-
can vote in their lives.
Henry Ford II was the first major big-
business figure to come out publicly for
President Johnson, long before the
Republicans nominated Senator Gold-
water. It is now obvious that he is by
no means a lonely figure in the ranks of
the traditionally Republican industrialists,
businessmen and bankers who form the
financial backbone of the American
establishment.
The Wall Street backlash has grown
out of fears that a Goldwater victory
would heighten chances of military ad-
ventures abroad, interfere with the steady
development of the domestic economy,
seriously affect the stock market and
alienate foreign opinion, with consequent
harm to foreign trade,
This widespread apprehension, prevail-
ing in the top echelons of the American
industrial and financial community, has
been sufficiently disturbing to cause a
major shift in the political views of men
who ordinarily vote Republican as auto-
matically as they send their sons to Yale
and Harvard.
According to a recent survey of mem-
bers of the Business Council, composed
of many of the nation s top executives
from business and financial houses, more
than 60 per cent favor the election of
Johnson over Goldwater. These same
men bitterly opposed President Roosevelt
in his last three terms in office, and were
no less hostile to Presidents Harry Tru-
man and John F. Kennedy, particularly
the latter, who horrified Wall Street by
forcing the all-powerful United States
Steel Company to back down on a pro-
posed price increase,
Lyndon Baines Johnson, a multi-
millionaire with extensive business inter-
ests in Texas, strikes a responsive chord
in the breasts of American tycoons,

despite his open devotion to the memory
of Franklin Roosevelt and his long record
of accomplishment in New Deal and
Fair Deal legislation as a congressional
leader under both Roosevelt and Truman.
The New York “Times” has quoted an
anonymous New York business executive
as exclaiming, “He is the answer to our
prayers”, after a Washington conference
with President Johnson. However, this
prayerful individual insisted on anony-
mity; many heads of big corporations
fear it is “bad business” to make known
their admiration for the President, in
view of the vindictive attitude of many
of Senator Goldwater’s supporters on
the far Right wing.
Among the policies which have en-
deared Johnson to Wall Street are his
obviously - sincere economy campaigns
(he has ordered all unnecessary lights out
in Government offices); his cautious
monetary and fiscal policies, including
tax reductions; and his administration’s
“friendlier” approach toward the prob-
lems of big business in the sensitive area
of labor relations.
Although the number of votes for
Johnson among industrial and financial
leaders will be of comparatively little con-
sequence, their means of influencing the
votes of others could prove highly effec-
tive with large blocs of voters including
employees and business associates.
By no means all Republican business-
men are reluctant to admit publicly their
switch to Johnson. A large group of
San Francisco industrialists, including
Stanley Powell Junior, president of the
Matson Navigation Company, have
banded together in support of the Presi-
dent. Sidney J. Weinberg, of the leading
Wall Street brokerage house, Goldman,
Sachs and Company, has appealed for
the President’s election. Weinberg pre-
dicted that Johnson would cause the
biggest split in the business community
since 1932, when Roosevelt attracted
much of its support in his first election.
“Most hate-making” campaign
TVJhat Mayor Robert Wagner, a scarred
" veteran of many a bruising New
York political battle, has called “the most
unpleasant, the most confusing, the most
divisive and hate-making campaign in
history”, had reached a fairly heated
stage even before the Democratic conven-
tion. Senator Goldwater stirred up a
storm of newspaper headlines by asser-
ting that the President had ordered the
use of nuclear weapons, if necessary, in
the recent US aerial attacks on North
Vietnam.
Goldwater has been criticised widely
for his advocacy of a policy of entrusting
area commanders with the authority to
employ nuclear weapons. In effect, he
charged, President Johnson had adopted
a similar policy in his order to the
fleet in the Gulf of Tonkin to attack
“with whatever force is necessary”.
Defence Secretary Robert McNamara
retorted that presidential orders to the
Navy specified the use of conventional
weapons only. As for the Goldwater
suggestion that the head of NATO or
other military chiefs be given the power
to use so-called “smaller nuclear bombs”, ,
McNamara pointed out in a Press con-
ference that “the average tactical 1
(nuclear) weapon in Europe has a yield
five times the bomb that was dropped on
Hiroshima”. Added the unsmiling civi-
lian head of America’s armed forces: “I
simply leave it to you to decide whether
you think power of that kind should be r
placed at the disposal of anyone other
than the President.”
In less than one hour of full-scale
nuclear war, McNamara reminded Sena-
tor Goldwater, almost 100 million Ameri-
cans would be killed. Furthermore, he
considered it his personal duty to assure

communications for presidential com-
mand over nuclear weapons—“my most
solemn obligation as Secretary of De-
fence”. He called upon the Democrats
at Atlantic City to make their first order
of business a formal re-affirmation of the
President's sole authority over nuclear
weapons. The Goldwater-dominated con-
vention at San Francisco rejected such a
proposed plank for their party platform.
Goldwater has acidly criticised the
Johnson defence policies for weakening
the country and changing the national
symbol “from an eagle to an ostrich”.
The military-minded candidate (he is an
active jet pilot with a reserve commis-
sion as an Air Force general) added that
“about the only bomb the administration
has produced has been McNamara”.
To this McNamara replied: “Our stra-
tegic forces are, and will remain in the
nineteen sixties and seventies, sufficient to
insure the destruction of both the Soviet
Union and Communist China under the
worst imaginable circumstances accom-
panying the outbreak of war.”
This remarkable exchange between the
Republican candidate and the Adminis-
tration's most informed military expert
pointed up both Goldwater's intention to
harass the Democrats on the state of
national defence and the sensitivity of
the President to this kind of attack, which
undoubtedly will cost him votes among
super-patriotic groups and those who
want aggressive action against Cuba and
North Vietnam.
Some believe President Johnson was
guilty of a strategic political blunder in
consulting Senator Goldwater in advance
of his retaliatory bombing order follow-
ing the North Vietnamese attacks on
American destroyers. His aim was lauda-
tory —to ensure bi-partisan support for
what might have developed into a major!
military crisis in the Far East. But it
gave the Senator added stature in the
eyes of the American people. It also
gave him the opportunity to criticise, with
more authority than before, the Presi-
dent’s role as Commander-in-Chief.

vention opened, the Democrats were
openly worrying about the possibility of
a freakish Goldwater victory, despite
public opinion polls showing the Presi-
dent well ahead. There was no doubt that
even this early in the campaign, which
will end on November 5, the Democrats
were “running scared”, in the classic
American phrase.
As a consequence it was imperative
that Johnson and top party strategists
should choose the strongest possible can-
didate for the Vice-Presidency to bolster
the Democratic ticket. The President’s
personal coolness towards Bobby Ken-
nedy had previously inspired him to read
his Attorney-General out of considera-
tion with the surprising declaration that
no member of the Presidential Cabinet
was eligible for the Vice-Presidential
nomination. As Bobby remarked wryly:
“I took a lot of good men over the side
with me.”
Two prospects
zero hour neared for picking the
second man on the Democratic presi-
dential team, two names received most
mention. They were Senator Eugene |
McCarthy, the handsome, liberal-minded
junior senator from Minnesota, and the;
senior senator from the same State,'
Hubert Humphrey. If it was thoughtj
necessary to “balance” the ticket with a
Roman Catholic, as the Republicans had
done at San Francisco by selecting Wil-
liam Miller to run with Barry Goldwater,
then McCarthy was thought likely to get
the nod.
However, it was believed that the
necessity for a Roman Catholic running
mate was not considered pressing by the
President, who would make the final,
decision. President Johnson had con-
fided pronounced leanings toward Sena-
tor Humphrey, his strong right hand
in the Senate throughout the course of
the Civil Rights legislation, unless he
could be convinced some other man
possessed the Minnesotan’s qualifications
for the post of Vice-President —and per-
haps President. Johnson, who has had
two heart attacks, is aware that his health
is a consideration to many voters.
Senator Humphrey is one of the
country’s most eloquent champions of the
under-dog. However, in 15 years of 1
congressional activity his color in they
political spectrum has shifted from 4
pinkish radicalism to a sombre, modera-
ted hue. It is perhaps significant that!
Humphrey spent most of his time in the
weeks preceding the Democratic conven-f
tion addressing business groups through!,
out the country, who were impressed by
his “moderate views”. This might well
have been a deliberate tactic designed to
bring the benefits of the Wall Street
backlash to the President’s running mat £
as well as to himself.

Toheroa
and
the Treaty
Maoris’ moment of truth?
From MAURICE SHADBOLT in
Auckland
lonce met an American gourmet who
was eating his way from New York
to Moscow. “A New Zealander?”
he said, obviously puzzled. “Wait a
moment. I know something about your
country. Hold it. I’ve got it. Yes—•
toheroa soup.”
A mild form of insanity overtakes the
country—and particularly the north of
North Island —around this time of the
year because of the species of shellfish
known as the toheroa. The public dig-
ging season opens on July 1, ends on
August 31. There is seldom a year with-
out some national crisis over the toheroa;
and such a crisis can be guaranteed to
blot out news from such peripheral
affairs as the war in Malaysia or the
Republican Party convention.
Before July 1, newspapers give breath-
less accounts of the condition of the
toheroa beds. The Minister of Marine
pleads with the public to observe the law
and take only individual quotas (20 fully
grown toheroas per person). Fisheries
inspectors multiply along the beaches,
keeping an eye open for premature plun-
derers. Then July 1 and the race begins.
Thousands of cars plunge on to the long
ocean beaches where the toheroa dwells
beneath sand around the half-tide mark.
Motorists cautious all the year round
become positively reckless in the search
for the toheroa; they ignore the hazard
of quicksand and the risk of salt-rusted
engines. More than twenty-three thous-
and people in five thousand cars poured
on to Muriwai Beach, near Auckland,
for the start of the season. On the
fourth day the first car was lost in surf;
the following weekend, during heavy
rain, fifty vehicles were bogged or over-
turned by soft sand.
Meantime, newspapers review the size
and condition of the newly-taken toheroa
with all the attention they might give to
the first night of an opera. Editorials
speak solemnly of the joys of taking the
toheroa; New Zealand poets celebrate it
too. The Minister of Marine gravely
patrols the beaches, reprimanding greedy
diggers, and reverently reburying under-
sized shellfish left behind after the plun-
der. For every full-sized toheroa taken,
probably a half-dozen small ones are
destroyed beneath wheels or by digging
implements.
This year there were panicky reports
from Ninety Mile Beach, in the far
north, that the toheroa were vanishing
again they actually did almost totally
vanish from North Island beaches for ten
years or more. No one has yet wholly ex-
plained why, or why they returned in
the late 19505. Maoris maintain that
commercial digging with metal imple-
ments drives the temperamental bivalve
away; they say the latest poor harvest is
due entirely to the fact that commercial
digging was resumed despite their pro-
tests two years ago. They claim that the
appetites of world gourmets are being
satisfied at the expense of their tradi-
tional—and, by tradition, god-given—
food.
And there is the rub. Behind the an-
nual comedy over the toheroa is a dis-
pute which is saddening and perhaps
embittering many Maoris.
Under the Treaty of Waitangi, signed
in 1840, Maori tribes ceded the country
to Queen Victoria in return for a guaran-
tee of certain traditional rights—among
them, of course, rights to the produce of
the seas.
But the Treaty was between the tribes
and Britain. It has never been ratified
by a New Zealand Parliament and thus
has no standing in law. (In fact the
actual document was lost and finally
discovered, rat-eaten, in a cellar in
1908.)
Shellfish may seem a small subject for
dispute, but it is a crucial one for many
northern Maoris, particularly those in
areas with a generally low standard of
living; they are accustomed to gathering
the toheroa all year round and continue
to do so regardless of the legal season.
For years the law often looked the other
way—if the law was around at all. But
in the last year there has been a sharp
increase in the number of Maoris prose-
cuted and fined for fisheries offences—
fines which, in many cases, they can ill
afford to pay.
For Maoris, the Treaty is a sacred
document; they speak of it as “our
Magna Charta”. It has never occurred
to them not to take it seriously. The
anniversary of the signing, February 6, is
celebrated with fervor; and Maori pres-
sure has made the date New Zealand’s
national day, though not yet a national
holiday. But if European New Zea-
landers can treat the document so casu-
ally, they say, where, then, will it stop?
After all the Treaty does more than de-
fine certain traditional rights; it also
guarantees equal social and political
rights. For example, many prominent
Maoris asserted in 1960 that exclusion
of members of their race from All Black
rugby teams for South Africa was
directly contrary to the spirit, if not the
precise letter, of the Treaty.
A plea for ratification
rFHE latest Maori to plead for Parlia-
mentary ratification is Sir Turi Carroll,
chairman of the New Zealand Maori
Council. But he took the unusual step
of linking this plea with a demand for
abolition of the four separate Maori
seats in Parliament.
These seats, in existence since 1867,
have all been securely Labor-held for the
last twenty years—thanks to an agree-
ment in the 1930 s between the Labor
Party and leaders of the then-powerful
Ratana Church, a purely Maori variant
of Christianity with a prophet of its
own. This has proved a happy, if short-
term, arrangement for Labor. 'The dis-
advantage is that until last year all
Maori MPs have been followers of the
Ratana faith. Catholics, Protestants and
Mormons have been excluded —and yet
Ratana represents less than 20 per cent
of the Maori population. Last year
Labor summoned up its courage at last
and stood a Mormon candidate; he was
elected despite Ratana opposition.
But for Sir Turi and others this still
isn’t good enough. Religion still plays
too big a part in Maori politics. Until
the four separate seats are abolished,
they argue, the Maori people will not be
wholly and effectively represented in
Parliament.
They have a point. The Maori MPs
elected over the last twenty years have
not been of notable quality. The Maori
viewpoint on many subjects—from the
Treaty of Waitangi onwards —could have
been argued more forcefully and skil-
fully in Parliament. And one suspects

that the religious stranglehold has driven
many potentially brilliant Maori leaders
into the political wilderness —some have
stood forlornly as Social Credit or
National candidates.
It seems, anyway, that the. Maori race
may now be approaching a certain
moment of truth. For one thing, Maoris
are already under-represented in Parlia-
ment; if separate representation is to
continue, they should have five or per-
haps six seats —and, within a few more
years, eight at least. (The Maori birth-
rate is far higher than the European.)
But on the other hand at the last general
election both National and Labor Parties
took the unprecedented step of standing
a Maori candidate for a European seat.
Neither was elected —neither had much
chance —but the move seems to indicate
that both parties agree eventual aboli-
tion of separate Maori seats is inevitable.
Speakers from both parties still insist,
however, that it is up to Maoris them-
selves to decide whether separate repre-
sentation will continue. Sir Eruera
Tirikatene, MP for Southern Maori, a
member of the Ratana Church since its
inception, says that he wants to see a
Maori elected in a European constitu-
ency before he commits himself.
Certainly, in its present time of crisis,
Maoris need leaders of quality. The
urban drift continues and we are begin-
ning to see the emergence of that un-
skilled “brown proletariat” which a few
far-sighted people predicted ten or
twenty years ago. Though a decreasing
majority still lives in the country, no
more than 20 per cent of Maoris are
now landowners. Yet—to take one
example among many—only seven
Maoris were enrolled as undergraduates
at Wellingtons Victoria University this
year; in proportion to population there
should have been a hundred or two.
The Governor-General, Sir Bernard Fer-
guson, speaking to former members of
the Maori Battalion recently, said he was
shocked to learn of this: he urged his
listeners to “box the ears” of their young
people.
Racial prejudice
the belated and still rather
pathetic efforts of the hastily-organis-
ed Maori Education Foundation, the per-
centage of Maori passes in the school
certificate examination has fallen; since
1959 the number of Maoris in upper
sixth forms has steadily declined. And
even in the trades Maoris represent less
than three per cent of the total appren-
ticeship force; in proportion to popula-
tion there should be three times as many.
Yet one often wonders if there isn't
something justified in the cynicism of
younger Maoris about the value of
higher education. Only the other day,
for example, I heard of a superbly well-
qualified young Maori v (with degrees
from two of the world’s leading univer-
sities) who has found difficulty in ob-
taining a suitable post. Yet he is a man
who at some time in the future would be
a logical and possibly admirable choice
as head of a university department. At
the moment he is literally pottering
about on odd jobs, with no prospects.
It seems that when a Maori does get an
education we don't know what to make
of him —we even seem a little afraid of
him.
And I remember something a Maori
journalist once said to me: “The real
test of race relations in this country
comes not when the Maori is your equal
—it’s when he is your boss. Or likely to
become your boss.”
' New Zealand's racial problems, then,
are far from ended. In some ways they
might be said to have just begun.


MOTORING
A Quiet, 100 m.p.h.
Lounge Room
The Lincoln Continental: “Over poweringly beautiful"
By BOADICEA
64 best car in the world.” This
statement has for years been
the proud claim of Rolls-Royce
and/or Bentley, if you prefer it; for the
two cars are identical apart from their
grilles and mascots and £2OO extra for
the added prestige of a Rolls. I suppose
few people would query the statement
but nowadays I wonder how true it is.
Certainly the Italians build more ex-
citing, more beautiful cars and with even
greater prestige, but they are grand
tourers rather than town carriages and
quite unsuited to ceremonial occasions.
The Germans now build the Grosser
Mercedes, a revival of the huge Mercedes
the Hitler gang used before the war, and
a very real carriage described as a “125
m.p.h. drawing-room”. America builds
luxury cars, Lincolns, Cadillacs and
Imperials used by Presidents and prize
fighters alike, and England builds the
Jaguar Mark X at less than half the
price of a Rolls and considered by some
to be twice the car. Very difficult for
the successful man to know which to
choose in the game of carmanship.
The Rolls and Bentley are easily re-
cognisable symbols of wealth and success,
but some successful men are shy and
sensitive. Driving one of these stately
vehicles recently, I learned what Rolls
men have to endure; caught in a traffic
jam the car had to be circumnavigated
by home-bound office workers and their
remarks were pointed. A pert typiste
looked me in the eye and said quite
loudly, “Can’t you afford a chauffeur as
well as the payments?”
Clean-cut, modern
A fine car, yes, but to me terribly
outdated with its tall, heavy silhouette,
small boot and small passenger space. A
safe handler and fast enough, but rather
like getting back into an MG TC these
days and wondering what one saw in the
classical little car.
How different, for instance, was the
Lincoln Continental I drove from Sydney
to Melbourne recently.
Here, in my opinion, was an almost
overpoweringly beautiful car in the
clean-cut modern manner. In severe
black, with a minimum of chrome, the
car was lower than my present Holden,
yet 18 feet long. Every conceivable gad-
get was built into the Lincoln; electrically
controlled seats, windows, door locks and
radio antenna. The car was air-condi-
tioned as only the Americans can air-
condition cars, 100 per cent effectively
and not merely a 10 per cent drop in
temperature as in some cars. Road and
wind noises were almost entirely insula-
ted from the huge interior and only at
full throttle did the massive seven-litre
V-8 320 b.h.p. engine intrude upon the
silence.
For years I had considered American
cars garish in design and decidedly poor
handlers but somewhere along the line
the American stylists and engineers have
had second thoughts, pruned the bric-a-
brac and firmed up the suspension.
Their engines are really magnificent
and are one very good reason why the
turbine engines have such a long way
to go before they have any advantage
over the smooth, silent, powerful and
reliable V-Bs. Now it is possible to drive
these lounge rooms at over 100 m.p.h.
with 15 rn.p.g. economy without the
sickly, floating feeling that characterised
the American cars of the fifties. Brakes
have long been the target of many a
motoring article and although Americans
have resisted following English and
Continental designers and their swing to
disc brakes, their big limousines do stop
safely and truly. The Lincoln has impres-
sively large drums and with power assis-
tance the results are good. Passenger
comfort is outstanding in the Lincoln.
Frequently, big men are surprised at
finding big cars have poor head and leg
room, so much space being occupied by
bonnet and boot that the living quarters
are relatively small. The 1964 Lincoln
has sprawling room for four big men
with sufficient room for three big men in
the rear seat over long journeys. It would
be possible to carry three in front, for
the seat is wide enough, the only restric-
tion being the automatic transmission
bulge in the floor. Centre rests make
high-speed travel more pleasant by help-
ing to compartment the occupants. Not
that there is any sensation of speed in a
Lincoln, for at 110 m.p.h. the car was so
steady and so quiet that I had the feel-
ing I could step out. Black leather and
stainless steel go well together in the in-
terior decor and I know of no more
comfortable seats. The front seats
were electrically adjustable for length of
travel, height and angle, and I would
defy anyone, whatever his size, not to
be comfortable behind the Lincoln’s
wheel.
Best of the bunch
0f course the driver has most fun out
of the Lincoln—or any good car for
that matter — in the response to throttle,
the light accurate steering and the satin-
smooth automatic transmission which
makes even traffic driving enjoyable.
The Lincoln is primarily a highway
and town car, but it has withstood some
of Australia’s worst country roads in a
most dignified manner, and did not bang
and crash over ruts and potholes as many
large conveyances do. Despite its rarity,
the Lincoln didn’t arouse much comment
around Sydney or Melbourne from
passers-by. However, my motoring
friends, perhaps more critical than I,
were genuine admirers of the car’s
beauty, comfort and excellent quality.
Genuine car enthusiasts who can
afford a Lincoln and are secure in their
status would do well to look at this
elegant car.
As a matter of interest, Australian
new car registrations in 1963 listed 38
Rolls/Bentley, 19 Cadillacs, two Ferraris
but no Lincolns. The current car is
better than the ’63 version and I know
of one of Australia’s leading industrial-
ists, a car lover, who has bought at
least one model of every large car built
on either side of the Atlantic. He rates
his “Continental” the best of the bunch.


OUT AND ABOUT
Solo on a Black Key
"I'm not a frustrated concert pianist ”
By JAN SMITH
HE trouble with this place,” said
Lou Levisohn in the noonday
gloom of Chequers nightclub
Sydney, “is that some people think you
can fix things by waving a magic wand.”
Apart from the amplifiers (too close
to the fluorescent lights?) and the micro-
phones and the noise of the plumbers
dismantling the Mandarin Room next
door, what things?
Lirst of all there was Miss Atwell’s
grand piano, urgently in need of a tuner.
The piano was being used at the moment
to accompany an Italian girl singer with
an Irish brogue, and was consequently
muffled. Was it bad?
“It’s bloody awful,” said Mr Levisohn
in his best international Cockney.
As Miss Atwell’s husband-manager,
Mr Levisohn was understandably in-
volved and despite an offer to help out
with answers until Miss Atwell arrived,
the burning question was still the grand
piano.
Sincere comments on Miss Atwell’s
apparent youth and slimness —no more
the jolly Aunt Jemimah face so familiar
from the old clippings did little to
soothe. “It’s all right for her to diet,”
said Mr Levisohn, indicating a plate of
cream cakes and some cold tea (the
plumbers had burst a pipe in the Man-
darin Room), “but at eight o’clock this
morning I was out at Botany chasing
a grand piano. Couldn't unlock the truck
because the keys were lost so we had to
find a locksmith. Then we couldn't find
the legs.”
After some hunting Mr Levisohn had
found the legs in a tea-chest, nailed to
the floor. Miss Atwell said later it was
customary to take the legs off grand
pianos when in storage, but at this stage
it sounded like honest Australian van-
dalism.
“So,” said Mr Levisohn,. “people put
cream cakes in front of me and I eat
them and get like this.” A large, plump
man with horn-rimmed glasses, Mr
Levisohn admitted he first met Miss
Atwell about 17 years ago at a show
business party.
How about the old piano? “Oh,” said
Mr Levisohn, “the other piano. Well,
that’s all right because we had it flown
out from England, and it’s never been
tuned since the day Winnie bought it in
a junk shop for 50 shillings.”
“Organised chaos,” said Mr Levisohn,
calling instructions to an electrician, and
recalling their hurried departure from
England. “Winnie did a concert at
Llandudno, stayed in Liverpool, went
back to London in the morning and
straight out here. And when we finish in
Australia (he didn’t know exactly when
because Miss Atwell would be touring
the provinces, like last time) we’re going
to Israel for concerts with the Israeli
Symphony Orchestra for the Jewish
National Lund. She’s going to play the
Grieg and the Rachmaninoff Concertos
and plant the first tree in the Winifred
Atwell Grove.
“After Israel, Winnie goes to Ghana,
on a personal invitation from Nkrumah,
to play at the opening of some new
hall,” said Mr Levisohn, leaping up to
interrogate an elderly Chinese rouse-
about about piano tuners.
With no further news, Mr Levisohn
recalled Miss Atwell’s warm reception in
outback towns on her previous tour,
when 109 private planes arrived at Long-
reach airport to swell the audience for
a concert in the new Civic Centre.
Three hours later, in her dressing-
room, Miss Atwell had a final word on
the pianos: “I guess it’s rather like the
old story of Napoleon’s piano, but then
show business is pretty much like the
Goons anyway.”
After the morning debacle, Miss
Atwell didn’t anticipate any further
trouble, although carting two pianos
around the provinces in a truck seemed
fraught with danger. “At least it’s not
a train,” said Miss Atwell, recalling, an
unfortunate experience with the British
Railways. “I've seen what they can do
to a piano in 40 miles. Never again.
Ivories ripped off and the front dented.
My husband had to paste the keys up
with sticking plaster or I’d have cut my
fingers to ribbons.”
Miss Atwell talked as she hung up her
dresses, 12 new creations from Aus-
tralian-born designer Lreddie Wright of
Great Portland Street, constructed from
cloth of silver, chiffon and sequins.
Although the dresses were tight, Miss
Atwell never had seating problems.
“I never sit down long enough,” she
said, explaining that she always changed
dresses for the other piano. “Something
flashy to suit the music, you see, although
I suppose my husband will have a few
words to say about this one.”
The cloth of gold had worn thin, so
Miss Atwell had had the dress made over
with a new skirt and king-sized gold
sequins.
“All men like to think they know best
about clothes,” she said, mentioning that
Mr Levisohn thought she looked less
than perfect during the day. “I know
I look a bit scruffy sometimes,” said
Miss Atwell, padding about with wild
hair and bare feet, “but I get all dressed
up at night so what’s it matter? Some-
times I go all day without looking in a

mirror. Life’s too short to worry about

Miss Atwell's spectacular dieting
five stone gone had begun at her hus-
band’s instigation. “I suppose it started
when I saw a photograph of myself in
a bathing costume, up at our house at
Bilgola,” she said, regretting that they’d
had to sell the house after some very
happy summer weekends. A former
neighbor, Digby Wolfe, had been in
London last year but she’d turned down
a chance to meet him backstage because
she was always shy about that sort of
thing.
She suffered mildly from first-night
nerves “we all do or we wouldn’t be
entertainers” —but it was nothing serious.
Entertainers brought up the subject of
Eartha Kitt, in town at the Chevron, but
Miss Atwell had never met her. “Mind
you,” she said, “I have the greatest
respect for Eartha as a performer.”
Miss Atwell has made three earlier
tours of Australia, twice for the Tivoli
circuit and the last time appearing at
Chequers and points west. A comment
about racial discrimination in 1962
brought a spate of angry letters from
country towns like Moree. “But actually
it had nothing to do with Moree,” said
Miss Atwell. “It was just the news-
papers’ favorite hotspot at the time. But
segregation in my audiences, or any-
where, is something I still object to.”
Miss Atwell goes to the United States
only for recording sessions, and South
Africa, where the Levisohns themselves
would be segregated, is not likely to see
her.
At this point Miss Atwell retrieved a
dry cleaner’s docket and objected
even more strongly. “Eight pounds for
three dresses! It’s the last time they get
any business from me. Who are these
people, anyway?” In vain one murmured
about the high cost of living and the
high price of fame as Miss Atwell
padded up and down in bare feet,
fuming. What did she do when she got
mad? She didn’t play the piano and she
certainly never threw things.
“I guess I just sulk for a while,” said
Miss Atwell darkly.
Miss Atwell soothed herself with
memories of their new mews house in
the West End, closer to town than their
old place in North London. “I'd like
to settle in Australia, because I’ve made
so many friends here, but on the other
hand we’ve got all our friends in Lon-
don. We do quite a lot of entertaining
and I love cooking for dinner parties.”
Miss Atwell began playing popular
music strictly from hunger, after coming
to England from Jamaica to study
classical music. “I had to get special
permission from the BBC to play in
variety,” she recalled, “because I’d passed
one of their classical piano auditions. I
even sang a bit in those days, but once
I’d discovered the old piano I didn’t
need to.”
For most of us it is hard to remember
a time when there wasn’t a Winifred
Atwell, and although her career began
as late as 1948, she seems almost a
cultural institution, as much a part of
this generation’s musical ethos as Nelson
Eddy was to our parents.
It was during her early days in variety
that Miss Atwell met her husband. A
talent promoter? “Goodness, no, he was
a comedian.” What sort, one asked, try-
ing to see Mr Levisohn as Archie Rice.
“Just patter stuff,” said Miss Atwell,
cagily. Comedians as husbands were no
more serious than anyone else, she
affirmed, but unfortunately, or was it
fortunately, he’d forgotten all his old
jokes so there was no need for polite
wifely laughs.
In most of her concerts Miss Atwell
plays a group of classical selections,
hardly light, since they include Bach,
but those most of her audiences might
be expected to know, like Beethoven,
Chopin and Spanish pieces.
“Everyone’s so concerned with images
these days,” said Miss Atwell, admitting
it must be hard for some people to
reconcile the two fields. “But I’m not a
frustrated concert pianist, and 1 have the
greatest admiration for the Beatles as
composers. I play a Beatle medley, but
it’s strictly my own arrangement.”
Earlier in the day Mr Levisohn had
mentioned the Beatle arrangements, and
squashed the idea, current in some
circles last winter, that their chord pro-
gressions bore a strong resemblance to
Schonberg.
“That’s one thing they can’t do with
Winnie,” said Mr Levisohn proudly.
“You can’t intellectualise good solid
entertainment.”

Meeting Mr
Wether ell
A short way with a dissenter
By PETER COLEMAN
A former miner and an old country
newspaper editor, whose main ex-
perience as a Minister of the Crown has
been in the care of trees, roads and
railways, seems an unlikely man at first
glance to be involved in an often strident
theological controversy about whether
small boys and girls can be taught ethics
at school without at the same time teach-
ing them Christian dogma. So when the
Honorable Ernest Wetherell, Minister of
Education and father of the new NSW
social studies syllabus which he had a
hand in writing, was told publicly that
his brain-child was “an insult to Christ”
(by the Rev. Gordon Powell, Presby-
terian) and “an ignorant and completely
unacceptable document” (by the Rev.
Alan Walker, Methodist), The Bulletin
was anxious to see how he was taking it.
“You’ll have to be quick,” the secre-
tary said, outside Mr Wetherell’s massive
panelled office on the first floor of the
Department of Education building on the
neo-classic side of Bridge Street. “The
Minister is pressed for time this morn-
ing.” A deputation from irate church-
men, or contented humanists? “No, he
has to open an international toy exhibi-
tion at Anthony Hordern’s.”
Mr Wetherell, it must be reported, is
completely undismayed by all the furore.
Now 71, bald, red-faced, knobbly-nosed,
with bushy white eyebrows, an etched-in
frown, and a voice so soft that he some-
times seems to whisper, the Macquarie
Street apostle of ethics without religion
and a grand old man of what is some-
times called the bowyang breed of Labor
politicians, stated firmly that as far as
he was concerned the new syllabus would
stand. In fact he couldn’t see what the
fuss was all about.
The Protestant spokesmen, we men-
tioned, ask how can you teach religious
ethics in one lesson when in the next
lesson pupils are told you can have
ethics without Christianity? “But
surely,” the Minister answered softly,
“all the churches have said we should
be tolerant of all religions. The Pope
has said we must understand other
religions. Is it only the Education De-
partment that is not supposed to say it?”
Presumably it was. Yet these Protes-
tants also say that there cannot be ethics
that are not based on Christian dogma?
“Surely,” the Minister almost whispered,
“they are wrong.” And now, raising his
voice with a slight note of anger, “Are
we to say that a Jew or a Buddhist or
a non-believer has no ethics because he
is not a Christian? Surely it’s right for
children to learn that people besides
themselves have ethical principles? You
can have ethics that aren’t tied to a
particular religion. You only have to
open the newspapers.” He was almost
whispering again now. “All that killing.
Those broken homes. We all know that
is wrong. We know kindness and friend-
liness and self-sacrifice are right. Surely
Jews and Buddhists know that as well as
Protestants? Don’t they? All those
people in the East. Surely it’s right that
children learn about their ethical prin-
ciples. We have to trade with them, too.
Or look at the Huxleys. They were non-
believers. The universities are full of
people who are non-believers. Have they
no ethics?”
We had no answer and asked instead
how he thought Christianity would be
taught in the new syllabus. “Well, you
can say that Jesus Christ was born on
such and such a day, describe His Life
and what He taught. Then you can
describe what Judaism believes, and so
on. Then the various religions can teach
their particular doctrines in the religious
classes. Remember that in the 1959
syllabus Christianity was written into the
Social Studies syllabus and made an
examinable subject. Was that fair to
Jews or non-believers?”
We agreed that it obviously was not.
“I believe in tolerance,” the Minister
whispered. “History and Experience has
taught me that.” What experience?
“Well, I grew up in Ballarat, Victoria,
and I remember the bigotry every St Pat-
rick’s Day and every Orangemen’s Day.
There was bitterness between neighbors
and even within families. It was terrible.
My family taught me tolerance. My
parents were divided on religion. My
mother was an Anglican and my father
was a Catholic. But there was never any
religious bitterness in our family. I’ve
always believed in tolerance like that,

and history has strengthened the belief.”
What history? “Oh, I read so much.
There was Buckle’s ‘History of Civilisa-
tion’. That was the great history. And
Winwood Reade’s ‘Martyrdom of Man’.
That was beautifully written. Or Dra-
per’s ‘lntellectual History of Europe’.
And Eugene Sue’s ‘Wandering Jew’—
though that took me a long while to get
through. They influenced me most,
apart from the novels of Jack London
and Upton Sinclair. Oh, and don’t forget
the Encyclopaedia Britannica.” He waved
at the shelves. “That’s a great history
book.”
In politics, then, who had influenced
him most in his ideas of tolerance? After
all, although he will not contest the next
election, he has been in the Labor Party
since he was 16, was editor of the “Bar-
rier Daily Truth” for 30 years after
having been a miner for ten years in
Victoria and NSW, has represented
Cobar since 1949, and during the Labor
split supported the late “Joe” Cahill after
an early sympathy with Dr H. V. Evatt.
His career has covered a lot of Labor
history. Who stands out in his mind?
“James Scullin,” he said immediately.
“But he died of a broken heart, unable
to do the things he wanted to do.”
The Minister’s eye fixed on the clock.
One last question. One of the Protestant
spokesmen accused him of foisting
agnosticism on to NSW schools. Would
he describe himself as a Christian? “Oh,
I can say I adhere to Christian ideas of
ethics. I believe in tolerance. But, look
here, I’ve got work to do.”
It was enough philosophy for one
morning. The Minister went off to open
the international toy exhibition, and
The Bulletin left convinced that the
father of the new social studies syllabus
will easily win what may be the last
fight in his public career.

He is hardlv shocked. From experi-
he js a man whose sense o( humor
anc j sense 0 f sa( ]ness have grown very
close together and are really one.
There are satisfactions. There is the
quality of the play which, as a farce, he
se es as a genuine descendant from
Moliere, whom he loves. He finds it
artfully constructed.
He takes a quiet pride in improve-
ments devised for it. The snap ending,
f or example, with Bertha the maid
arriving to shack down with a handsome
airline pilot is only one of his own
touches,
Sitting at his mirror, putting on his
grease-paint, he talks drolly of curious
costly adventures with film makers who
all seem to try to out-Goldwyn Sam.
You learn what it means to commit
a full year to perhaps three plays that
get good notices and take no cash.
He worries about getting together
enough estate to provide for his family,
come what may.
He has done well in TV. His role as
Mr Fenner in “The Rag Trade” made
him famous here in advance of his
arrival.
He did a lot of radio work —acting
and writing—when radio mattered in
England. One series with his friend of
20 years standing, Peter Ustinov, called
“In All Directions”, is in the archives,
I should say, as a BBC classic.
At a pinch he can turn to cabaret,
without songs, because he is tone
deaf. Even when this means the Dorches-
ter, the Mayfair and Quaglino’s in the
West End he doesn’t care for it.
He’s a theatre man.
Peter Jones is from Shropshire. He
was born at a place called Wem in 1920,
the only son of a cabinet maker.
There was no family tradition to carry
him to the theatre. He likes to quote
something about the stage being a refuge
for the unhappy and untalented.
He made his first stage attempt at
Wolverhampton in 1936, as the “Times”
reporter in a play called “The Composite
Man”. He was fired.
Six years later he was in the West
End. He has played something like 30
roles there now, in everything from revue
to Shaw, T. S. Eliot, Moliere, Restora-
tion comedies, and an adaptation of
H. E. Bates’ “The Darling Buds of May”.
Melbourne’s Little \Theatre, oddly
enough, was the first to produce his
thriller “Marion”, later made into a
film called “Marilyn”. The producers
hoped to cash in on the fame of Marilyn
Monroe. According to the author, the
result was “awful”.
He wrote another play he called “The
Song of the Centipede”, but by the time
it made the West Epd it had become
“Sweet Madness”, which still makes him
wince.
He writes mostly now for TV. His
latest comedy is about three crooks whose
girl friends realise with alarm that crime
is earning a lower income than the
national average for honest people.
But he’ll probably write for the stage
again soon. He would like to experi-
ment, for one thing, with plays which
leap right into the deep heart of the story,
and scrap slow build-ups ruthlessly.
Australia and Australian theatre he
doesn’t feel competent yet to speak
about —except to appeal for more sup-
port for the local actor.
He describes as one of his best theatri-
cal experiences in Australia a produc-
tion of “Othello” he caught at the Union
Theatre in Sydney.
“Only about eight people there, but
it was fine,” he said.

On The Margin
THE TRADITION OF DEBATE
“ A ustralians have got to stop pre-
tending that life consists of a
nice little woman, a nice little man
and nice little kids in a nice little
house.”
Professor Frederick May, an
Englishman at Sydney University,
issued this warning (The Bulletin,
August 15). Thoughtful Australians,
as well as visitors, have said much the
same thing. It is a truism among
mature, intelligent people that the
cultural development of this country
is being held up by our addiction to
nice little women and nice little kids.
But it is one thing to point out this
social evil, another to correct it. One
sees the same saddening thing happen
so often. A decent, educated young
Australian starts out knowing well
how limiting and second-rate it is to
live with a nice little woman, etc. Yet
he finishes up doing so. Why?
The trouble is that a man finds it
hard to do anything else. Consider
his alternatives to living with a nice
little woman. Briefly, they are these:
(1) He can live alone. The incon-
veniences of this are well known
boredom, poor service, having to eat
out, never knowing where the next
girl is coming from.
(2) He can live with a nasty little
woman. I have known men who did
this. It is an interesting experience to
look back on, like being at the war.
But such men do not remain happy
in the service; they want out.
(3) He can live with a nice little
concubine. This arrangement is pleas-
ant enough, but lacks permanence.
Sooner or later she turns into a nice
little woman, especially if she starts
to have nice little kids.
(4) He can live with a nice little
man. This admittedly carries a social
cachet, but it requires special apti-
tudes. The average chap cannot hope
to make a success of it.
(5) He can adopt the French com-
promise live with a nice little
woman and keep another one some-
where else. Unfortunately this costs
too much. Even in France not many
can afford it.
These, then, are the pressures that
make the Australian live with a nice
little woman, whether he wants to or
not. In the same way relentless forces
drive him to live in a nice little house.
It is preferable to live in a nice big
house, but this is possible only for
the few.
Alternatively, he can live in a nasty
little house. This provides material
for creative writing, like living with
a nasty little woman. But it has the
same drawback: it is no fun.
He can live in a nice little flat. This
is OK until the nice little kids come.
After that, it is hell, The nice little
house is the only answer.
The Australian weakness for having
nice little kids seems incorrigible.
Anyone of sophisticated tastes knows
that nasty little kids are more interest-
ing (as depicted in, say, The Belles of
St. Trinian’s, Lord of the Flies). But
when it comes to the point the Austra-
lian prefers nice little kids. Even if his
kids are nasty he is apt to think they
are nice.
So here we have him, trapped in
his suburban nest, an object of pity
and concern to cultivated persons like
Professor May. Yet there is one gleam
of hope. The Australian can find
escape through good literature. Nice
though his little house is, he can read
books there preferably bannable
ones —* about nasty men living with
nasty little women in nasty little
houses.
Moreover, the nice little house is
still a stronghold of something which
Piofessor May values highly “the
English tradition of debate.”. Those
nice little women can debate with the
best of them.

airliner
ever built
The BAC One-Eleven offers passengers and operators more advantages
than any other short-haul airliner in the world—and that includes those
starting life 140,000 airline hours or more behind the One-Eleven.
ONLY THE ONE-ELEVEN:
□ Is engineered by a team with four generations of continuous
short-haul airliner experience—including the Viscount.
□ Is backed by the most comprehensive structural test programme
ever mounted in this field.
□ls self-contained for turn-round as standard—no extras.
□ Uses milled-from-the-solid fail-safe construction based on actual
experience with three other types of aircraft.
□ Is flying and is in full production today.
□ Will, before its nearest competitor first flies, be logging 1 j million
passenger route miles a week involving 600 landings and 400 flying
hours every day. *
□ Yet the BAC One-Eleven costs very much less to buy than any
comparable aircraft. :

OVERSEAS
Djakarta —1
Weeding Out
Foreign
Influence
Imperialists offend us...
From DENNIS BLOODWORTH
in Singapore
President Soekarno of Indonesia
has strongly repudiated Tunku
Abdul Rahman’s accusation that
he is “the Hitler of Asia”. Addressing
10,000 students in Djakarta, the “Bung”
pointed scornfully to what he took to
be the essential difference between him-
self and the late Fuhrer: Hitler hated
Communists, he said, “but I even like
them”. Four years ago the Indonesian
President, who has “commanded” that
all the resources of his 100 million-strong
island Republic be thrown into the
struggle to “Crush Malaysia”, said that
the difference between them lay in the
fact that Adolf Hitler was not a true
revolutionary.
He noted with approval, however,
that Hitler, Christ and Mohammed had
shared with him his own secret of success
—they had all promised something to
the masses. “Paint a brilliant picture
of your aims,” he urged his subordinates
in 1960 —whether these were to be the
Third Reich, the Kingdom of Heaven,
a paradise full of houris or Indonesian
“Guided Democracy”.
Soekarno retains this facility for
identifying all sacred doctrine with his
own ploys. In a message to the 2,000,000
Buddhists of Indonesia on the birthday
of the Buddha, he said: “The anti-
colonialist spirit and love of freedom are
in keeping with the teaching of the
Buddha.” He then exhorted the devout
to honor their peaceable faith by helping
the Indonesian Government to smash
Malaysia. To the fifth conference of the
Indonesian Council of Churches he
declared that Christ was a revolutionary
who freed his people from Roman
oppression and was indicted on political
grounds. “The basic aims of the Indo-
nesian revolution run parallel to the aims
of the Christian faith,” he added.
Echoing him, Mr K. A. Saifuddin
Zuhri, Indonesia’s Minister for Religions,
then sternly warned the churches of
Indonesia that it was their Christian
duty to adopt a firm attitude towards
Malaysia and fight imperialism, colonial-
ism and neo-colonialism.
“We’re against foreigners”
QJoekarno has appointed an 11 -man
committee under Mr Ruslan Abdul-
gani, Minister for information, to estab-
lish “uniformity in the nation’s culture”.
The new body will “weed out foreign
influences”. “We’re against foreigners,”
announced Soekarno, “and we are
especially against imperialists because
they have always offended us.”
Rotary and the Boy Scouts have long
since been suppressed in Indonesia, and
foreign diplomats have not been allowed
to join “Friendship Clubs” lest they con-
taminate the locals. In April, several
hundred foreign books were publicly
burned. In July, Professor Prijono,
Minister for Education, outlawed Beatle
haircuts and Dutch nicknames. Children
are warned not to call their parents
“mummy” and “pappy” since this con-
stitutes “a mockery of Indonesian
national identity”. Jeans, tight sweaters
and Chinese cheong-sams are also out.
So, until recently, were Western films.
But this last ban boomeranged. At
the Communist-manipulated Afro-Asian
film festival in Djakarta in May, US
films were roundly condemned “Tar-
zan” was propaganda to prove that one
illiterate white was a match for 10,000
Africans, for example and a special
committee called for a nation-wide boy-
cott of US and then British movies.
In Medan, students broke up a private
showing of Queen Elizabeth’s visit to
India, given by the British Consul on
the occasion of the Royal Birthday. The
boycott was effective, and officials
promised a flow of films from People’s
China and other “newly emerging
forces”. However, this time Indonesian
leadership had overreached itself.
Seventy per cent of imported pictures
had come from the United States. The
local film industry was in its infancy.
The full-length socialist sagas from the
“newly emerging forces” were greeted
with disgust. Numerous cinemas shut
down and sacked their workers after
playing to almost empty houses, and an
acute shortage of films developed.
The aggrieved boycott committee was
accused of “rash and illegal” action by
the Indonesian Artists’ Association.
Officials reported a sharp decline in
entertainment revenue, and the Deputy-
Minister for Information finally de-
nounced the boycott, reminding its
organisers that Indonesia had diplomatic
relations with the United States and
Britain and that anyway a censor
existed (ofns.)
Djakarta —2
When the
Dutch
Came Back
...not on " Baas-Kuli ” basis
By FRANK PALMOS
Last week Djakarta's Press began
to leak details of the extent of the
agreements made by the Dutch
Foreign Minister, Dr Josef Luns, during
his visit earlier this month.
And already economists are pleading
that the 100 million guilders credit must
not lead to another spree of importing
luxury goods.
“We need a million vehicles for public
transport don’t import sedans,” said
Djakarta’s moderate evening paper
“Sinar Harapan” (Ray of Hope).
Discussing the consequences of the
visit, “Sinar Harapan’s” economist un-
favorably compared Indonesia’s trans-
port situation with Australia’s, and de-
nounced those who “wanted to import
sedans and luxury items each time credit
was granted”.
Most papers, including the PKl’s
“People’s Daily”, were pleased with Dr
Lun’s visit, and felt that the re-establish-
ment of economic relations would be
valuable for Indonesia.
The appointment of the Sultan of
Jogjakarta regarded as “extremely
honest”—to handle a special department
of the Finance Ministry was popular.
With the Sultan, and economist J. D.
Massie (for banking) a “new approach”
to economic affairs was noted.
Commenting on the visit, “Sinar Hara-
pan’s” economist wrote: “The last weeks
have seen a complete renewal of friend-
ship with The Netherlands—and not on
a Baas-Kuli (Boss to Coolie) basis.
“The Dutch were here 300 years, and
they have a fuller knowledge of our


country than others —so communication
should be easy.
“There are many Dutch plants still
in operation here, but not running at
peak efficiency because of shortages of
spare parts. The Dutch could help us
with these spare parts. If necessary we
should bring experts here on a fact-
finding mission.
“We also need more ships, locomotives
and planes, like the Fokker Friendship
which seems ideal for our conditions.
“We lose 11,000,000,000 manhours
annually because of seasonal fluctuations
in employment. Proper use of loans and
services of technicians could avoid this.”
The economist said Indonesia was
short of public transport and that Aus-
tralia, with only 11,000,000 people, had
1,000,000 vehicles, while Indonesia, with
103 million people, had only 100,000.
“But we are happy to report that 8500
trucks will be imported this year.”
“Sinar Harapan” then spoke of the Sul-
tan’s honesty: “Let’s hope he will clamp
down on unnecessary spending and stop
the flow of bribes going into the pockets
of Government servants.” It was hoped
that the Sultan would make certain that
Dutch economic assistance was well
handled.
Details of the agreement so far re-
leased are:
For Indonesia
• 100,000,000 guilders credit
guarantee for 1965.
• Dockyard and dredging assist-
ance.
• Aircraft and airfield construction
help.
• Equipment for electricity plants.
Djakarta still has blackouts in
some suburbs every day of the
week.
• Permission to open a consulate
in Surinam, The Netherlands
West Indies, where thousands of
Indonesians were taken as
laborers.
For The Netherlands
• Tin, rubber and tobacco pro-
cessing contracts (many of them
formerly lost to the British).
• Permission for repatriation of
the 30,000 Indonesians living in
The Netherlands.
• Transfer to The Netherlands of
cargo shipping contracts now
held by British, Norwegian and
Swedish companies.
• A possible tin smelting plant in
Indonesia.
On Djakarta television, Dr Luns said
that the Dutch Finance Minister, Pro-
fessor Jacobus Andriessen, would visit
Indonesia to finalise the agreements “and
I might return with him, for I have been
most touched by my reception. I have
the deepest respect for President Soe-
karno, Indonesian leaders and people”.
The Lesson of Lenshina
“Wash Us , Father, Wash Us”
By BRYAN WILSON
surrender of Alice Lenshina, pro-
-*• phetess of the Lumpa Church in
Northern Rhodesia, may be the begin-
ning of the end of Mr Kenneth Kaunda’s
troubles with this sect. But it is not often
that religious movements wither with the
arrest of their leaders. Much now de-
pends on how Alice Lenshina is treated:
whether peace will come to Rhodesia’s
northern and north-eastern provinces, or
whether a troublesome underground
movement —more fanatical than the open
activities of the Lumpa Church, and more
explicitly hostile —will now develop.
It would be idle to think that the proof
of failure in arms, the lack of expected
invincibility (whether taught by Lenshina
herself, her subordinates, or others)
would convince fan-
atical religionists of
the falsity of their
faith. The evidence
from similar religi-
ously inspired upris-
ings elsewhere in
Africa, among the
Hau Hau in the New
Zealand Maori wars,
among the Sioux
Indians who rose
against the United
States troops after
the failure of the
Ghost Dance to re-
store their ancestors and the old way of
life, all suggests that faith persists in
spite of failure.
The Lenshina movement, Christian in
its church organisation, simple faith and
pious hymns (“Wash Us, Father, Wash
Us”; “Teach Us, Saviour, You Have
Shown a Way of Life”) and African in
its anti-witchcraft activities, obviously
responds to intensely felt needs which
are not met by the orthodox churches
and missions. Outlawing the Lumpa
Church would not eliminate the need of
Rhodesians for a simple, direct faith
which, unlike the missions, takes witch-
craft seriously and gives men protection
from it. It provides hope, an interpre-
tation of life, and an ethic to meet it in
African terms, under African leadership
and at a level which is comprehensible to
the illiterate and semi-literate of a society
in a state of confused transition.
Even the report of Lumpa members
covering themselves with excrement for
protection is no ultimate indication of the
movement’s perversity. Similar practices
have occurred before and constituted a
widespread ritual in the Munkukusa anti-
witchcraft movement of the neighboring
Congo in the 19505.
Mr Kaunda, even though he spoke
earlier of vengeance and proscribed the
Lumpa Church, has wisely said that there
are to be no reprisals. Real pacification
will, however, depend on what is done
with Alice Lenshina herself. To sen-
tence her to a long term of imprison-
ment, and to ban the church, would
simply set the stage for her martyrdom
and, perhaps, her deification, in a pattern
which has become familiar in Africa.
The Belgian Congo Government
arrested Simon Kimbangou in 1921 after
only a few months of activity as a free
evangelist. Like Lenshina, he had fallen
foul of missionaries, but, like her, he had
not originally intended to take people
out of the missions and he, too, had
preached against fet-
ishes. His meetings
were characterised
by ecstasy more in-
tense than that re-
ported from the
Lumpa Church, and
he made more dra-
matic attempts to
cure diseases, but the
social effect of pil-
grims travelling long
distances to see him,
as they have done
for Lenshina, was
the same. The Kim-
bangouists were not anti-Government
(nor even anti-white) until Kimbangou
was arrested.
Thereafter, through the long years of
his imprisonment—he died in prison in
Elisabethville in 1950 —his followers,
through many vicissitudes, not only kept
his name alive but made it a symbol
against oppression.
It appears, then, that even if Mr
Kaunda is right in suggesting that the
Lumpa Church has been exploited for
political ends, he should remember that
fanatical religious faith is likely to per-
sist after those political elements have
been purged. The faith would only be
intensified if Lenshina were martyred by
imprisonment.
Alice Lenshina imprisoned could easily
become a legend among her people: Len-
shina simply set free might appear
mightier than the Government itself. Mr
Kaunda is an imaginative and humane
statesman. He could, in due time, call
together thousands of Lenshina’s follow-
ers and, with a show of superior power,
return to them their prophetess and
ensure them of their liberty to abstain
from party politics, (ofns)

Military Aid to S.-E. Asia
Listing the facts...
In last week’s Bulletin, Dr T. B. Millar, a Fellow at the ANU and a
Duntroon graduate, argued the case for the teintroduction of National Service.
In the House of Representatives three Government backbenchers urged the
Government to introduce selective national service training, while two of them,
Messrs Bate and Turner (Lib., NSW), said the Government should have
provided more money for national defence in the 1964-65 Budget. Apart from
the question of the desirability of National Service, what are the facts of
Australian military aid to South-East Asia?

Military aid to Vietnam
Qince 1962 a training team of 30 in-
structors has been engaged in train-
ing Vietnamese in jungle warfare and vil-
lage defence. A number of Vietnamese
officers are also being trained at Army
schools in Australia. Economic aid to the
value of £3,500,000 has also been pro-
vided for defence support and for social
and economic development of villages.
On June 8 Defence Minister Paltridge
announced the Army team of 30 would
be doubled. In addition the Army is to
provide about an additional 20 specialist
instructors and advisers. The present
number of Army personnel in Vietnam
is 63. In addition to the increased
strength, Australian personnel can now
be deployed in the field at battalion and
lower levels as adviser teams. One per-
son has already been killed.
A detachment of three RAAF Caribou
aircraft have arrived in Vietnam with
servicing and support facilities. Three
more will follow. 34 RAAF personnel
are there and will be increased to 67.
An expert team under the former
Services Attache in Laos, Colonel W. J.
Crosby, has recently returned to Austra-
lia and his recommendations for further
non-military aid are at present under
consideration. Australia also maintains
part of a squadron of Sabre jets at Übon
in Thailand.

THEATRE
Morality in the
Drawing-room
The sententiousness of George Bernard Shaw
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
Heartbreak House. Bernard Shaw. Old
Tote Theatre, Sydney.
Qhaw’s plays are still stimulating and
entertaining, even if they don't seem
as outrageous as they once did. And
since he has a strong sense of theatre
and provides his players with splendid
lines, his plays give the deceptive impres-
sion of being foolproof for performance.
That nothing could be further from
the truth —that in fact Shaw demands
a high degree of talent and profession-
alism —is depressingly illustrated by the
Old Tote Theatre production of “Heart-
break House”.
Though Shaw is often credited with
bringing reality back to the English
theatre, his plays are not realistic in
style. He uses art to expound an argu-
ment, not to mirror life. His contribution
to the theatre was to substitute thinking
for a set of attitudes, and to show that a
lively conflict of ideas could be more
dramatically effective than any number
of Fates Worse Than Death, or Mortal
Combats.
Nor are his characters realistic. Their
main purpose on the stage is to express
opposing arguments or to represent one
of Shaw’s abstract conventions. This is
the essential difference between Shaw
and Ibsen: Though Ibsen, too, used the
drama to voice his convictions, his
prime concern is with the personality of
his characters, and their reactions under
stress. So Ibsen’s plays have more
passion and humanity, less clarity and
wit, than Shaw’s.
One is not necessarily greater than
the other they merely approach a
similar dramatic problem in different
ways. But Ibsen’s plays, because of the
characters’ more recognisable humanity,
can stand up successfully to production
and acting that is well below first class.
Not so Shaw: since his characters are
deliberately two-dimensional, he depends
on his actors to give them the necessary
solidity.
The difficulties are greatest in “Heart-
break House”, a kind of morality play
in the form of drawing-room comedy
written at the beginning of the Great
War. The setting is the conventional
country house-party, but hosts and
guests are far from conventional, and in
microcosm they show us a society which
refuses to face the fact of its own self-
induced dissolution. Despite the thun-
derous though cock-eyed warnings of
Captain Shotover, they continue (even
when their pretences are stripped away)
to play their meaningless social game.
Even the final air raid is greeted without
fear or concern, as a novel experience
which with any luck will be repeated
next night.
theme of man's self-destruction is
unfortunately always topical, but
many of Shaw's comments, for instance
his jabs at British colonialism, seem sadly
dated now; and the cracker-night sound
effects for the raid seem comically
harmless in the nuclear age. For this
reason it would surely have been wiser
to dress the production in the period—
modern dress makes Shaw’s purely con-
temporary allusions jarringly anachro-
nistic.
This is admittedly a difficult play for
actors, with its flickering changes of
mood. The present company are almost
entirely baffled by these variations of
tone, as well as by the contradictions
inherent in the characters themselves.
Edward Hepple (Captain Shotover)
manages best. In his early scenes he
lends robust humor to a stock per-
formance as a crusty eccentric; and he
often makes the Captain’s more sombre
moments genuinely moving. But the
character never has the large universality
intended Hepple sounds like an old
man grieving over his own inadequacy
rather than a prophet mourning the
follies of the world.
Unquiet
Wedding
All in Good Time. Bill Naughton. St
Martin’s. Melbourne.
“f|uß Violet is just the same as she
was,” moans Mrs Piper, a Lanca-
shire mother, six weeks after her
daughter’s wedding to young Arthur
Fitton, a sensitive, music-loving cinema-
projectionist from Bolton. In other
words, Arthur is too sensitive and poor
Violet is not yet a wife.
Bill Naughton’s comedy, for all that
it is broad, has a new theme: What can
happen to the sexual happiness of young
people living with their parents in a
cramped household. It’s a working-class
story worked out with great gusto and
considerable finesse, rather better of its
kind than many that have recently been
successful. Occasionally approaching the
borderline of farce, it yet has an under-
lying seriousness. The bride’s meddling
mother and the groom’s bumptious
father are both not guiltless of their
children’s predicament, and as the action
gently unfolds their own skeletons are
dragged from the cupboards. This is a
play in the sound tradition of “Hobson’s
Choice” but with a modern tang.
In the competent hands of producer
Peter Randall it makes very enjoyable
entertainment. The structure of the first
act is rather scrappy but the second act
is a beauty, and the atmosphere through-
out is realistic and convincing. Even the
dialect is managed with aplomb.
The entire cast acquits itself well,
though Naughton has given his older
characters more to say and do than his
perplexed lovers. Moira Carleton as
Mother Fitton brings a robust humanity
to her part and Terry Norris, as her
husband, is at least as plausible a Fitton
as he was recently a Luther. Dennis
Miller and Trisha Watson as the young
couple have just the right blend of
earthiness and lyricism. The smoothly
professional production makes the most
of its material.

FILMS
Escape
The Day And The Hour. Director,
Rene Clement. Recently at Liberty
Theatre, Sydney.
m H E inevitable flops of any established
director generally show some in-
teresting traces of his individual touch.
A film like Rene Clement's “The Day
And The Hour” is a depressing puzzle:
how could a practised, professional


director make a film so dreary, lethargic
and amateurishly constructed?
Clement has never been an innovator,
and his work has in consequence been
rather despised by the newer French
film-makers. But he has been a fine
craftsman whose films, though conven-
tional in treament, were never fuddy-
duddy.
As well as the confident skill in film-
ing to be seen in his best work, one can
trace a recurring theme his recognition
of man’s powerlessness in the face of
circumstances and of other men’s in-
humanity. This is most obvious in his
finest film, “Jeux Interdits”, but it comes
through even in a piece of pure enter-
tainment, “Plein Soleil ”, especially in the
restrained bitterness of the scenes be-
tween the young sponger and his scorn-
ful patron.
But this seems only a tendency of mind
rather than a formulated conviction, and
Clement seems to need a script that
states the issue clearly before he can be
inspired. The two films mentioned and
“Gervaise”, which represent his best
work, were all based on novels.
There’s certainly nothing to inspire
anyone in “The Day and the Hour”,
which goes through the old wartime-
escape routine. This is the old chestnut
about the Frenchwoman who unwillingly
helps a crashed pilot to escape from
occupied territory and, of course, falls in
love.
This ancient plot could still have been
made into a rousing adventure story, or
used as the theme for a personal state-
ment. Clement does neither he seems
as bewildered as any of his audience as
to what it's all about, and the lack of
suspense is truly remarkable.
The creakiness of the whole enterprise
is increased by a dark and scratchy print
and a soundtrack that is often incom-
prehensible.
Even Simone Signoret, who is incap-
able of a really bad performance, seems
weighed down and subdued. Stuart
Whitman shambles through the film as
the singularly charmless hero.

asinine and pompous aspects of
British justice have always had an
irresistible appeal to comic writers in
film and fiction, and “Mr Justice Dun-
cannon” belongs to a time-honored tra-
dition. Perhaps this BBC series is in-
tended to help restore the authority of
the Bench so sadly undermined by the
eloquent patrician hauteur of Boyd, QC.
Mr Boyd laid down the law to the judges.
Now we have Mr Justice Duncannon
bullying, browbeating and bewildering
counsel unfortunate enough to plead
cases in his court.
I suspect that Andrew Cruickshank, in
the role, is supposed to impress us as a
rather likeable old boy. He is, in fact,
an egotistical old curmudgeon and we
are delighted when he is occasionally
taken down a peg or two. Cruickshank, a
veteran and accomplished character
actor, plays the part with gusto. The
leonine head drops portentously under
its wig, the eyebrows contract, the lower
lip protrudes menacingly as he rumbles
objurgations at some brash young lawyer
who has presumed to question his ruling.
It is perhaps a less rewarding role than
that of Dr Cameron, the fine old whisky-
guzzling tyrant who kept Dr Finlay in
his place at Tannoch Brae, but Cruick-
shank certainly makes the most of it.
The script, by Muir and Norden, has
its ups and downs but generally it is
competently and tightly written. To the
irreverent layman the ordinary processes
and language of the law are entertaining
enough without the addition of the Fourth
Form facetiousness that marks some
other Muir and Norden TV writing.
The camera rarely strays out of the
courtroom and each episode is built
round a verbal battle between Bench and
Bar. The prisoner, a glum and silent
spectator in the dock, appears only
momentarily just enough to show us
that someone’s future is actually being
decided and the business is not entirely a
ritualistic exercise.
As usual in British TV films the minor
characters lawyers, witnesses and the
rest are uniformly excellent. They
demonstrate what an extraordinary reser-
voir of talent British producers have to
draw on. I am constantly and probably
naively amazed at the numbers of actors
and actresses who flit briefly across the
screen, bring a character to life so bril-
liantly and then vanish never to be seen
again. There was one unforgettable
young thug in “Z-Cars” who looked as
though he could act many far more
famous figures off any stage in the world.
Apart from the ABC play, a chancy
prospect, Wednesday night offers pretty
dull television fare in Sydney. “Mr Justice
Duncannon” can be recommended to fill
in the after-dinner half-hour.
“Lorna Doone”, the new BBC serial on
Sydney’s Channel 2 (Sundays, 7.30 p.m.),
got off to a satisfying start. The opening
scenes captured the atmosphere of the
bleak, misty moorlands amid which
Blackmore’s tale is set, though, from the
ruggedness of the scenery, I have the
feeling that they were probably shot in
Cumberland or Scotland rather than on
the somewhat tamer hills of Exmoor.
The Doones, the outlawed aristocrats,
legends of whom still haunt the villages
round Dunkery Beacon, were an attrac-
tively sinister parcel of villains. In the
first episode we saw Lorna and John Ridd
only as children, but the script managed
to suggest the shadow of coming events
in the lives of these star-crossed lovers.
Some viewers may find the West Country
accents a bit baffling. The throaty gurgle
of “Zummerset” makes demands on the
ear just as hard as the mangled vowels
of Liverpool. But we got used to Con-
stables Steele and Fancy Smith, didn’t
we?

collections shown in Australia
could match this second Thai ex-
hibition for sheer beauty. Gathered
over a two-year period these sculptures
provide undiluted pleasure and they
would grace any gallery in the world.
Beginning with the Dvaravati style of
the 6th-11th centuries assortment of
deity and Buddha heads, we see in an
art whose terracotta medium enabled
time to work a superb surface, some-
thing near to the Indian Gupta styles
with striking similarities to pre-
Columbian sculpture. Here is playful-
ness, abundant youth and touches of
humor combined in unmeasured brilli-
ance with the deepest contemplative
genius. Nothing is stereotyped, dry or
arid. Like Greek art, fragments dis-
close an organic fullness.
With Kmer styles, 1100-1250, a
peak of monumental carving was achiev-
ed. The examples here, some twenty in
all, are superlative. Long slim torsos,
implicit with movement, of Shiva or
Urna are planed to the absolute mini-
mum of expressive line in which bone,
muscle and flesh have dissolved into an
overriding plastic gesture. They attain an
artistic Nirvana having no dependence
whatever on the forms of sense but
realising without distraction a religio-
aesthetic concept. Total abstraction, one
might say.
Lopburi, 11th-14th century bronzes,
sensuous enrichment reminiscent of
Angkor Wat. Nothing repetitive mars
their manifold detail, nor does any
minute variant of the prototype appear
to have daunted the capacities of monk-
craftsmen in the skills of bronze casting.
Pre-eminent among these is the 20-inch
standing Buddha in royal robes, whose
enormous sense of scale would fit a
colossus.
That this feeling could permeate even


the smallest heads or fragments of hands
is amply demonstrated through the suc-
ceeding Cheng Sen 11th, Sukhodaya
13th-lsth centuries to the twilight of the
U Tong, 14th-15th, Ayudhya 15th-18th
centuries and the national styles, where
skill informs lingering imaginations of a
classic past and the ingratiating charm
enshrc ’ding what remained.

Landscape and
Abstraction
David Newbury. Recently at Argus
Gallery. Melbourne.
Bob Haberfield. South Yarra Gallery.
Melbourne.
ITtHE marriage of landscape painting with
formal abstraction has been a happy
one. David Newbury is one of several
Melbourne painters who have concen-
trated on landscape formalised to vary-
ing degrees throughout a couple of
changes in fashion.
Previously his colors were rather
sombre. No doubt this allowed him to
concentrate on shapes, but it cut short
his feeling for the subject. Not that
he has now relaxed formal control —on
the contrary it is still sometimes too
obvious but he has manifestly enough
confidence in his composition to open
his painting to personal feeling. We have
moved, in short, from having the painter
in control to having something of the
artist present.
Bob Haberfield will be a new name to
most people. His exhibition at the South
Yarra is, to my knowledge, his first solo
show. Like most of the new painters, he
favors strong and fanciful imagery—
“the language of the marvellous”, as he
calls it. Since this amounts to a kind of
surrealism, Haberfield finds himself, more
perhaps by good fortune than by design,
in the latest fashion.
His “language of the marvellous” is
well enunciated, even if it is sometimes
not especially a source of wonder. The
imagery is predominantly visceral, and
certainly has that surrealistic power of
seeming detached but important. Why
landscapes of the liver and charts of the
capillaries should appear to be of more
than formal interest is not easy to explain.
Haberfield, in any case, is not concerned
with the precise order of microstructures
but with creating images which combine
beauty with unfamiliarity. One is at-
tracted to the pictures, but uneasily, just
as one loves the color of blood but is
often sick at the sight of it. There is
no telling how permanent Haberfield’s
interest in this imagery will be, or what
more he can make of it, but he is a good
painter and he will continue, I am sure,
to compel attention.

I>ach’s concertos for solo harpsichord
and orchestra were as freakish in
their day as Brahms’ work for a pair of
soloists was in its later day. For Bach’s
audiende the role of the harpsichord in
the orchestra was essentially functional
to fill out the harmony and mark the
rhythm; to make it the solo instrument
was like making the stage manager the
star. Even the idea of a solo concerto —
of the concerto as a “star vehicle” as
distinct from the older conception of the
concerto as a study in contrasting in-
strumental colors was relatively new.
It is welcome to have the whole set
recorded, in performances that leave very
little cause for complaint. They reveal
in the A Major Concerto (BW1055)
a warmly expressive work fully worthy
to stand beside the two better-known
concertos, while the concertos in D
major and G minor, which are arrange-
ments of the familiar violin concertos in
E major and A minor, give a fascinating
insight into Bach’s methods of work.
The playing is lively, technically ex-
pert and reasonably authentic in style,
but Veyron-Lacroix’s harpsichord often
seems a little too light for the strings.
The fault, I feel, lies not in the harpsi-
chord, which has a delightfully delicate,
yet warmly colored tone, but in the size
of the string orchestra it is asked to
compete with.
With Mozart we find the pianoforte
(more assertive than the harpsichord)
supplanting the violin as the main con-
certo instrument, for by Mozart’s time
the concerto was most commonly a
“vehicle” for the composer-performer in
public concerts, and most composers
were pianists Mozart, as far as we
can judge, was probably the finest of his
day. The two concertos so beautifully
played by Serkin in this recording were
written for a series of concerts Mozart
gave in Vienna in the winter of 1784-85.
Serkin and Szell make an ideal com-
bination for Mozart. The interpretation
is of the sort that is hardest to describe,
simply because of its excellence; it pre-
sents the music with devoted care and
sympathy and with no special personal
characteristics that derive from the artist
rather than the composer. This is not to
say that it is cold or detached; on the
contrary it is always warmly alive, and
in the dark D Minor Concerto (No. 20)
deeply felt.
The recording of the “Sinfonia Con-
certante” combines two brilliant soloists
in undoubtedly brilliant performances,
but it does not yield the same all-round
satisfaction. For one thing the orchestra,
which has much more than a mere
accompanying role in this work, is fairly
unaristocratic, though not actually sinful.
Heifetz’s playing is clean and secure as
usual, but this work, which always
astonishes with its breadth and emotional
maturity (Mozart was 23 when he wrote
it), calls for rather more personal in-
volvement than Heifetz seems to bring
to it. Where violin and viola play the
same phrases antiphonally one is con-
scious of the greater warmth and flexi-
bility of Primrose’s playing.
On the reverse side Heifetz soars con-
fidently through the sentiment and pyro-
technics of the Glazounov concerto
but it is surely a lapse both in taste and
commercial sense to couple two such
incompatible works.
Concertos for more than one instru-
ment were already unconventional in
Mozart’s day; he wrote only about half
a dozen such in more than 50 concertos.
In Brahms’ day the idea was not only un-
conventional but downright subversive;
it went against all the 19th-century
principles of the virtuoso as hero by
putting two heroes in one drama. Yet
in the rich and resourceful score of
the A Minor Concerto one never has
the feeling that Brahms is struggling with
an unfamiliar or anomalous form.
Admittedly the gruff-and-grump open-
ing orchestral phrase always makes me
wince: it seems to forebode Brahms in
his determinedly austere, this-hurts-me-
more-than-you vein. But what is for me
the true -and better Brahms, songful,
tender and full-hearted, soon takes over
and pervades most of the concerto. The
playing of Ferras and Tortelier captures
this lyricism splendidly. Kletzki directs
with authority.

Rise and Fall of a Dictator
The opportunism of Mussolini
By M. H. ELLIS
Mussolini, Study of a Demagogue. Sit
Ivone Kirkpatrick. Odhams Press.
70s.
Zooming from the pen of Sir Ivone
Kirkpatrick this is a biography of
importance. The author deprecates his
capacity to speak with authority on
Italian affairs on the basis Of a period as
First Secretary at the British Embassy
in Rome and another period as Charge
d’Affaires at the Vatican, both in the
nineteen-thirties. But he was in the inner
circle of the cast in the drama of Berlin
immediately before the outbreak of war.
He is fully seized of the debt that Nazism
owed to Fascism, He was the Director
of the Foreign Division of the British
Information Service and later Controller
of the European Services of the BBC in
the period during which Italy entered
World War 11, and the man selected
to interview Hess when he paid his un-
expected visit to Scotland. So any study
by him of a subject intimately connected
with Fascism is entitled to close atten-
tion.
His book is not exciting for its literary
art. Much of it has the arid clarity of a
carefully framed Foreign Office despatch
on a ticklish subject. But he has learned
the golden rule which few biographers
ingest: That detail properly arranged and
giving both sides of the question is more
illuminating, and more likely to win the
confidence of the reader, than any flower-
ily expressed judgments; also that the
object of a biography, even when called
a “study”, is to present a picture of a
life in all its planes, not a critique; and
that it is best to leave the reader to make
his own final assessment, which he will
do anyhow, no matter how an author
may plead for a particular point of view.
Mussolini was the kind of subject for
which biographers pray, but which fate
seldom awards them. His cupboards
were all open, his skeletons were on the
table brazenly displayed and labelled.
Italians have been noted as shameless in
literary self-revelation, but II Duce was
always open for inspection down to the
last crease in his being, naked and un-
abashed. The openness with which he
betrayed, turned traitor to men and
causes, and his cynical acceptance of the
basest conceptions of human morality
seem to have had a mesmeric effect on
both victims and onlookers. He was as
cool and open in betraying a cause or
a friend as he was in shooting a son-in-
law, the husband of his favorite daughter.
In the beginning of his career he
was a dirty, ragged, unshaven vagabond,
too individualistic to be a Marxist, al-
most too extreme for nihilists to go along
with. He read his Machiavelli and
adopted the worst and most cynical
aphorisms in “the Prince” as his own,
without imbibing its lessons for tyrants
and dictators. Thus, he could write, even
after his rags had been replaced by frock
coat, silk hat and spats, and his nihilism
by the creed which centred on power
applied through corporative dictatorship
and ruthless discipline which he repudia-
ted always when applied to himself, that
“if he were allowed to judge his fellows
and his compatriots he would not atten-
uate in the least Machiavelli’s verdict on
mankind.” And this verdict was that it
might be said generally of men that
“they are ungrateful, voluble, deceitful,
shirkers of danger, greedy of gain.”
Thus scorn for the masses, for the fellow
members of his party and for the rights
of the individual were to “inspire our
hero at every stage of his career”, while
his treatment of the nobles and land
owners “the enemies of civilisation”
was activated by an ingrained social
grudge.
Oir Ivone’s subject was not so much a
whole physically that the eye could take
him in one piece for moments together.
As I remember him, you saw him sit-
ting and were astonished that he was so
large and powerful a man. He rose, and
with a sense of profound shock, you
realised that he was only the rather mon-
strous head and torso of a six-foot man
fitted onto a little man’s legs. You
looked at his face carefully and saw a
Latin mobility of feature out of which
stared two hard, black Armenian eyes.
You heard the round Tuscan phrases
issuing harsh-toned from the rather
flabby mouth in accents inherited from
some Asiatic barbarian left behind in
the melting pot of the turbulent
Romagna, from which he hailed. He
was the apotheosis of a family in which
both grandfather and father had been
in trouble for their violence and rebel-
liousness in politics. And he seems to
have believed in nothing save the efficacy
of opportunism.
Violence, he claimed was “moral,
more moral than compromise”. Work,
he early declared, was “brutalising”. The
Vatican harbored a “gang of robbers”.
He eschewed marriage—the woman who
lived devoted to him, forgiving his infi-
delities, he never married in the conven-
tional sense. To everything that made
for order and civilisation he was apos-
tate. He claimed to have “torn to pieces
all revealed truths, spat upon all dog-
mas, rejected all the paradises, scoffed
at all the charlatans selling miraculous
drugs to produce the happiness of man-
kind”, whether emanating from the
Christian belief or from the Kremlin.
If he had held himself as a prototype
of the Machiavellian “generality of man-
kind”, he would have been the perfect
exhibit for the purpose. For he seems
to have harnessed all the forces of good
or evil to his own opportunism and
personal ambition.
He used socialism to rise from the
dregs and betrayed it. He was the pro-
fessed foe of patriotism, yet he used
historic patriotism in his attempts to
build a new Imperialist Rome as a set-
ting for himself. He was the vociferous
opponent of national war, yet he became
a national hero through being given false
credit for having brought Italy into
World War I on the side of the Allies.
He despised armed force, yet he posed
as a hero of the war; he gloried in the
assassination of monarchs, but used the
fact that the King visited him when he
lay wounded in hospital to build his own
status. He described money as “detest-
able”, yet when he came to need it to
arm himself with the supreme and irre-
sistible weapon of the European revolu-
tionary, a daily paper, he was prepared
to go to any lengths to get it.
On the surface during his regime,
what he was doing seemed to be much
for the good of Italy. The superficial
and swiftly passing observer saw nothing
of the excesses of his Fascists both be-
fore and after the march on Rome —the
woundings, the killings, the destructions
of labor headquarters. The foreigner


saw the cleaned-up malarial swamps, the
tidied towns, the improved transport, the
triumphal monuments. But he did not
see that it was all a misuse of good
principles to feed opportunist ambition.
Mussolini’s outstanding gifts were im-
agination and a cynical ability to apply
them by seizing every fleeting chance
to turn events to his own advantage. In
this field he was truly great, for he was
the master of the techniques which the
Nazis copied from him. Hitler him-
self confessed that “the brown shirt
would probably not have existed if it
had not been for the black shirt” and
that his regard (in the earlier days) for
the Fascist leader “bordered on venera-
tion”. He was undoubtedly magnetic,
dominating and persuasive. Emil Lud-
wig called him a “great statesman”. Von
Papen paid tribute to his “great strength
of character and immense charm”.
Even Churchill, at the moment when
Italy's adhesion to the German cause at
a crisis of the war seemed likely to
bring destruction to Britain, said in a
broadcast, “That he is great I do not
deny”. But he was in the ultimate
interested in nothing but personal power.
And he ended hung up by the ankles
like a hare being prepared for jugging,
because the inevitable law beat him; the
immutable law that he failed to heed if
he read it in Machiavelli’s “Prince”:
“Chi, accecato dalV ambizione, si con-
duce in iuogo (altissimo) . . . e poi con
massimo danno di cadere necessitato” —
“he who, blinded by ambition, achieves
the topmost heights, must needs achieve
the greatest fall”.

in time, for she died in 1958, but in
temper; and to read her letters to her
sister is to enter into a busy and argu-
mentative, yet at the same time leisurely
and gentle way of life. In her introduc-
tion the editor, Constance Babington
Smith, speaks of Rose Macaulay’s pro-
ductiveness. In the ’twenties, for ex-
ample, she produced a novel almost
every year “portraying with detached
amusement the vagaries of contempo-
rary society”. In the 50 years between
1906 and 1956 she published 23 novels,
as well as books of essays, criticism,
history and travel. I can recall reading
some of her novels, and being captivated
by a world which seemed so distant as
to be hardly believable. The polish
and refinement of her wit lent to her
subject the unreality that belongs to any
world whose inhabitants never seem to
come up against the severer tests of exis-
tence.
But it is a mistake, as these letters
show, to think of Rose Macaulay merely
as a refined literary lady. She was in-
tensely religious; and her attachment to
religion expressed itself not simply in
attendance at church and interest in
church affairs, but in the anxious soul-
searching of a woman who lost her faith,
and struggled with mind as well as with
heart to regain it. At least some of the
struggle is recorded in these letters; more
particularly her exploration of doctrinal
matters, and her progress in the stages
of belief. These passages show the
depth and honesty of her self-examina-
tion.
Ohe was also, of course, a popular and
lively public figure. She entered into
all sorts of current controversies by
writing letters to the daily papers, and by
giving radio talks. She liked to enter into
correspondence privately, too, on any
matters of opinion which stimulated or
provoked her, and she clearly expended
a good deal of mental and physical
energy in these activities. The letters
are full of comments, angry, scornful,
amused, or ardently approving, upon
current affairs, news items, and topics of
the day. Her sister is the recipient of
her immediate reactions to what she has
heard, read and seen. She argues about
politics, the General Strike of 1926, the
events leading up to the Second Wosld
War, the rights and wrongs of what she
calls “the war party” and “the peace
party”; and she comments upon one of
her favorite topics—the programmes on
radio and television, in particular those
broadcast parlor games such as “The
Brains Trust”, “The Critics” and “Any
Questions?”
There is surprisingly little literary
comment, and no real literary debate.
Anyone who expects more than the
briefest comments on her own books
will be disappointed. Her references to
her literary acquaintances are just as
slight. I had hoped, for example, that
she might have something to say about
E. M. Forster, whose work she was
quick to appreciate, and upon whom she
wrote the first full-length study. But
there are only a few passing references to
him, none of which is more than trivial.
In the end, then, the value of this
correspondence seems to me limited.
There are too many snacks, and too
little meat; and a surfeit of snacks
destroys the appetite without satisfying
it. Certainly, her letters recall the circles
in which she moved, and the days
through which she lived. But for all her
liveliness and wit, her views lack both
the originality and the depth which might
have made them memorable.

Advertisements
for Himself
Confessions of an Advertising Man.
David Ogilvy. Longmans. 265. 6d.
HThe ideology of creative activity still
clings to the idea of the lonely in-
dividual working it all out for himself.
But, in fact, most people who develop
the ambition to do this end up on maga-
zines, newspapers, in advertising agen-
cies, TV stations, movie studios, PR
outfits or some other large organisation
that employs teams of “creative people”
along with a lot of others who are simply
doing more normal jobs in a different
atmosphere.
This is one of the reasons why some of
the more sensitive members of our kind
of society end up being enemies of it
things haven’t worked out as they were
meant to.
However, there isn’t any easy answer
for them. In the totalitarian alternatives,
“creative people” get bundled into tightly
controlled organisations that manufac-
ture propaganda, or they may get
bundled out of society altogether. It is
as if history has decided: Now they can
all read and write we have to make
more jobs for them all, we have to have
people manufacturing by mass assembly
new simplifications of living. There have
never been such societies before in which
so many people earned a living casting
new reflections of life. What are you
supposed to do when you have a group
of these people together and you want
to get the best out of them to suit the
purposes of your organisation?
David Ogilvy describes his policy for
running an advertising agency in terms
of running a great kitchen. Be sparing of
praise. Exploit crises as morale-builders.
Keep deadline promises and deliver the
goods, whatever the agony or overtime.
Keep everything tidy. Inspect everything
to make sure it’s right. Work longer
hours than your staff. Try to keep com-
munication channels open and build
yourself up as a personality so that your
staff care about their “standing with
father”.
This is all routine shrewd advice, of
general application. In reading it out of
context you wouldn’t know whether
he was talking about the staff of
advertising agencies, film studios, or
school magazines. But where Ogilvy
cheats a bit is when he says: “I have
come to the conclusion that the top man
has one principal responsibility: To pro-
vide an atmosphere in which creative
mavericks can do useful work.” Unfor-
tunately he is weak on the details of how
he performs this difficult function. What


he says is the kind of thing “father”
might whisper confidentially to a junior
copy-writer at the staff Christmas party.
But how do you make it happen? What
normally seems to happen now in the
big American agencies is that you pro-
duce a system that makes it easier to run
an agency. Into this you fit your staff and
your clients. Then you work out a sales
pitch for it. What comes out of it is
advertising that meets the formulas of
the agency.
In producing newspapers or magazines
there are virtues in formula work. Habit
is one of the important factors for the
commercial success of periodical publi-
cations. There must be about them a
certain repetitive character, issue by
issue. (Although you may also spring a
few surprises.) This means you have to
force a staff into accepting certain gen-
eral limitations and guide-lines.
The same kind of thing happens in
other parts of the entertainment business,
although there is more room for the
breakthrough of new formulas in movies
or TV than in periodical publishing. (A
new formula in publishing usually in-
volves a new periodical, and therefore
a bigger risk.)
In advertising except perhaps for
certain general limitations of fashion
there is no habitual demand amongst
potential consumers for a formula in
advertising and it is often in the interests
of clients that their ads should not be
like all the other ads turned out by an
agency.
But it can be easier for agencies if
they work by systems and formula. And
this is what the American agencies have
been doing.
To avoid doing this can involve greater
demands of flexibility, of really thinking
through what a client’s marketing objec-
tives demand. One of the fascinating
things about advertising is to work out
how this flexibility can be maintained. In
his general pitch, Ogilvy has little that is
specific to say about this. From other
sections of his book one gathers that he
may have ceased to be preoccupied with
this question in his own agency.

China Abroad
The Chinese View of Their Place in
the World. C. P. Fitzgerald. Oxford
University Press, London. 10s.
npHE mounting violence of the Sino-
Soviet ideological dispute has asto-
nished as much as it has pleased the
West. Communism, we are told, has
now become “polycentric” and a host of
Sinologists are turning to explaining the
importance of the word “Chinese” in
the term “Chinese Communism”.
Much of this literature examines the
thought of Mao Tse-tung, not as a crea-
tive development of Marxism-Leninism,
but as containing clues to the real role of
Chineseness in Chinese Communism to-
day. Nationalism, the sense of Chinese
tradition and pride in China’s glorious
past, several writers assure us, are among
the crucial motivating forces of Mao’s
life. What is true of Mao, it is said,
is true of China: The new wine of Com-
munism has been poured into a very
old bottle indeed.
Professor C. P. Fitzgerald’s 30,000-
word essay, “The Chinese View of Their
Place in the World”, first in the new
series of Chatham House essays on prob-
lems of international affairs, seeks to
lend support for this view by consider-
ing the question of China’s cultural con-
tinuity and not merely Mao’s personality.
Ranging over 3000 years of China’s
cultural history—a history on which
Professor Fitzgerald has written a far
more substantial but still very readable
volume—the booklet attempts to explain
Communist Chinese international atti-
tudes in terms of the traditional Chinese
sense of cultural self-sufficiency and
superiority to the rest of the world.
From the first millennium BC, when
the sense of cultural and racial identity
emerged in China’s still un-unified states,
to the end of the Manchu dynasty in
the first decade of this century, China
successfully resisted significant contact
with the outside world, and success-
fully assimilated those of her various
conquerors whom she had failed to keep
beyond the Great Wall. These assimila-
tions themselves only confirmed and
strengthened the view that “barbarians”
had nothing to offer China in the way of
culture or religion and that nothing from
outside (including Buddhism) was of any
value at all, unless it were first thorough-
ly and completely Sinicised.
The successful 19th-century encroach-
ment of European barbarians, who re-
fused to become Sinicised, was thus some-
thing of a shock: but the dominant
Chinese reaction alternated between utter
rejection of the West and a carefully
limited acceptance of some of its cul-
ture and technology with the sole aim
of “saving China” and restoring the
glory of the T’ang.
Throughout her history, Professor
Fitzgerald argues, China concluded no
alliances with the barbarians around her
or the conquerors on part of her soil.
Only in the first and second world wars
did China find herself forced into
alliances with the anti-German powers,
and in each case these alliances proved,
from her point of view, unbeneficial.
Soviet Russia was to become China’s
first freely chosen ally—and, in the end,
as unbeneficial as the rest.
China remained excluded from the
UN and from significant foreign rela-
tions with the majority of the great
powers; she was forced back —as Pro-
fessor Fitzgerald sees it—to her tradi-
tional view of a world in which China
was the sole upholder of true civilisa-
tion, the lawgiver to the barbarians, the
only centre a Chinese could recognise.
Translated into Communist terminology,
this becomes the claim that China is the
true upholder of pure Marxism and
Mao its only true contemporary prophet.
As light cultural history for the lay-
man, Professor Fitzgerald’s little booklet
is elegant, interesting and eminently read-
able. Professor Fitzgerald has a flair for
conveying Chinese cultural attitudes to
the Western reader: Even an anglicised
Chinese reading this booklet wrily recog-
nises his own prejudices. But as serious
discussion of the contemporary political
problem of China, it is very, very thin.
The relation beween Marxism and Chin-
ese tradition is not seriously discussed;
the causes of the Sino-Soviet dispute are
much simplified and its future prospects
(it will. not end in a final rupture) are
presented far too glibly.

Malayan
Economy
The Political Economy of Independent
Malaya. Ed. by T. H. Silcock and
E. K. Fisk, Australian National
University. 425.
HThe pattern of economic change in
South-East Asian countries is easier
to see than to interpret. Nevertheless, a
team of experts from the Australian
National University applied themselves
in 1962 to an examination and interpreta-
tion of the economic problems of Malaya
and this volume, essentially a search to
find meanings in fact and trends, is
the result.
Except at one or two points, the study
cuts off at the end of 1962 and the
authors throughout use the term Malaya
rather than Malaysia.
Malaya has four basic problems
racial imbalance, increasing population
pressures, instability, and balance-of-pay-
ments difficulties. These apply also to
numbers of other under-developed tropi-
cal countries, often in a more acute form.
In his foreword, Sir John Crawford sees
this book as a study in hope by im-
plication, studies of other South-East
Asian countries might well be studies
in despair.

contrast with, say, Indonesia), and it has
a relationship between population growth
and resources that, to Sir John, seem
“less intractable both in magnitude and
in sheer difficulty than those of some of
its larger neighbors”.
Yet, its basic problems are serious.
Its economy relies almost wholly on only
two exports rubber and tin.
Malayan rubber production and world
price tend to vary in some sympathy. The
world price is very variable, ranging from
as high as 169.55 cents a lb. in 1951
(coinciding with the Emergency and the
Korean War boom) to as low as 67.30
cents in 1954. In 1962 the world price
was 78.20 cents a lb. It has since fallen
and may continue to fall to as low as
50 cents.
Malaya is now only marginally the
world's main supplier of rubber
737,000 tons in 1962 compared with the
next main supplier, Indonesia, with
671,000. It is estimated, however, that
by 1970, while Indonesia’s output will
have increased to 700,000 tons, Malaya,
by improved production techniques and
the coming to maturity of higher-yielding
trees, will be producing some 1,132,000
tons.
One of the main sources of instability
in the rubber industry is the variability
of demand, particularly from the Soviet.
And overshadowing this as a perpetual
threat is the USA’s stockpile of over
1,000,000 tons of natural rubber and its
increasing know-how in synthetics.
Similarly, tin is unstable. The Soviet
demand is erratic, aluminium is proving
to be a serious competitor and is reducing
the demand for tin, and, again, there is a
USA stockpile.
What are some possible alternatives?
Diversification is being studied but no
quick solutions are coming forward. The
coconut industry has long been de-
pressed. There is some hope in palm oil
but as yet rubber prices are still too
high to make large-scale development
of palm oil attractive. Fishing offers little
prospect coastal waters have long been
over-fished.
Malaya’s balance-of-payments prob-
lem is serious. About 30 per cent of
the country’s net imports consists of food
8 per cent of rice. And the amount
of suitable land available imposes a natu-
ral limit on the extent to which it can
increase its independence in rice. At pre-
sent it pays Malaya to export rubber and
import rice. Moreover, the population in
recent years has increased a good deal
faster than the labor force.
Industrialisation is at a relatively high
level but is not yet being taken very
seriously. Certainly the stage of self-
sustaining industrial growth has not yet
been reached. Malaya has sufficient for-
eign funds to sustain an intensive indus-
trial development but is singularly lack-
ing in managerial resources to meet the
challenge of the years ahead.
Underlying all these are the human
problems not the least of which is
that the native Malays constitute only
about 50 per cent of the total population
and generally are rural and backward.
Yet the position is not without hope
and this is why “The Political Economy
of Independent Malaya” is a significant
study. It demonstrates an order in ap-
parent confusion; it illustrates and
explains some complex economic move-
ments that are taking place; and it offers
some solutions human, economic, and
fiscal.
The first three introductory chapters,
described as essential for an understand-
ing of what follows, are hard going; the
remainder of the book should cause the
intelligent layman no trouble.
As a piece of book production, this
work just passes muster. The jacket de-
sign could hardly be less attractive.
ROALD ROSE
Search for
Identity
The Thirtieth Year. Ingeborg Bach-
mann. Andre Deutsch. 235.
Tngeborg Bachmann is probably the
most highly regarded poet now writ-
ing in German. “The Thirtieth Year”,
her first prose fiction work, here superbly
translated by Micheal Bullock, is a col-
lection of short stories which, though
not in any obvious sense lyrical, are still
clearly the product of a poetic sensibility.
Everything is formulated in terms of
mood, sensation, idea, without a firmly
established objective situation. Inner
states are associated with particular times
and places, but these function as symbols
and formulas rather than as localisations
and motivations. These stories have, as
it were, no surface, they are all depth
and reflection. The dangers of expressing
a fundamentally poetic attitude in a prose
form, even if it is as flexible as the short
story, are not always avoided; there is
sometimes a lack of tautness and con-
tour, and also of detachment, a failure to
release the characters into an indepen-
dent fictional reality.
Unlike many poets experimenting in
prose, Miss Bachmann is not a pure
observer recording and responding with-
out judgment or commitment. She has
a clearly defined viewpoint, which reveals
affinities with Camus, and her stories
have a solid intellectual core. They are
all related by one major theme, and this
gives the book a weight and coherence
which collections of short stories often
lack. This central preoccupation is the
search for an authentic identity, a per-
sonal truth, in a maze of hypocrisy, delu-
sion, discontinuity.
All the stories deal with the desire
to make a fresh start; not by escaping
into a new situation, but by finding
some fresh area of the self, untouched
by prejudice, conditioning, habits and
pressures. The title story takes the thirti-
eth year as the arrival at the point where
the hero can no longer live on potential,
and where all the relationships he has
gradually built up begin to impose on
him an image with which he gradually
identifies himself, but which does not
grow out of, or correspond to, any ex-
perienced inner reality. “Everything”
describes a father’s attempt to let his son
have a fresh view of the world, without
forcing on him any preconceived atti-
tude. Another story shows the failure to
break through to new values after the
disasters of the war, and another tells
of a judge brought by a trial to realise
that his meticulous adherence to truth

has been only a more insidious form of
self deception.
In each case, there is rebellion against
life and society followed, after a threat-
ened or actual disaster, by some form of
acceptance, whether affirmation or resig-
nation. The acceptance tends to be less
convincingly conveyed than the rebellion
and comes sometimes as a slight anti-
climax. The difficulty lies, perhaps, in the
fact that an existential problem is intro-
duced on a scale which would require a
development and resolution beyond the

of the saddest things about the
writing of the Aboriginal story is
that the writing of it has been left so
late that scarcely any of the tribes of
Australian indigenes, even in remnant
state, whose culture has not been eroded
or falsified by close contact with Euro-
peans, are left to study. However, at
least some groups of tribes have been
reasonably documented, necessarily the
most remote such as the Arunta or
Aranda as it is becoming fashion-
able to call them and these have
yielded more authentic data through the
work of such men as Basedow and
Strehlow, Mountford and Thompson
than the Eastern and Southern tribes and
the Tasmanians who more or less dis-
appeared before the days of trained an-
thropologists and recording instruments,
particularly tape recorders.
Time has become very precious in as-
sembling anything like a comparative
study of tribal cultures and particularly
Aboriginal music. As Dr Ellis points out,
there are only five active enthnomusi-
cologists at work on native music, all in
isolation from each other, and it will be
many years before a full analysis of
their studies of recordings and notes will
be available. Dr Ellis’s own study is a
correlation mainly based on the field
work of others among the various
Aranda septs and other Central Austra-
lian peoples. It is important in that it
goes far to systematize a basis for com-
parison and analysis. It contains many
transcribed and scored songs musically
interpreted by use of a characteristic
sign manual adapted to a complexity of
pattern and highly developed system of
rhythms and cadences of Aboriginal
singing. She deduces a high form of
organisation in native music which cer-
tainly had a much more widespread
application to the daily life and regimen
of the Aboriginal and in his law-giving
than it has with more culturally highly
developed peoples.
The whole plan of the music was not a
mere emanation of emotion but, so to
speak, a mnemonic aid to the teaching of
lore, custom, religion, legend and ethical
behavior. It becomes more and more
evident that an understanding of its prin-
ciples and range are essential to the
understanding of the overall culture of
our so-called “primitive” peoples who
were anything but primitive in some
matters of the mind and understanding.
The Sheard diary, xerographed from
a typescript, is the day-to-day journal of
a youth of 18 who, in 1940, with little
experience of the world outside the South
Australian town of Nuriootpa, accom-
panied Charles Mountford on a series
of journeys among the primitive tribes of
the western central deserts of the Com-
monwealth.
The journey covered mainly the
country of the Mann, Tomkinson and
Musgrave Ranges, with a traverse north-
wards to Ayer’s Rock and Mt Olga
old stuff even to tourists these days but
even at that recent time very much out
of bounds to all but a few locals and
expeditionaries. The narrative is some-
what naif as might be expected, but
marked by acute observation and in its
way a human document of note. It is
illustrated with dim photographs and a
map and has an introduction and tribute
to the young author (who died in the
war) by Mountford.

Collages. Anais Nin. Peter Owen. 235.
A nais Nin reminds me of those instru-
mentalists who have great technical
grace and skill but yet convey no real
image of the music they play. Every note
is correct, individual phrases are enchant-
ing, but the performance remains a tech-
nical exercise rather than an artistic
revelation.
Anais Nin’s writing is fluent and evo-
cative. She often amazes with a spendidly
accurate phrase or a flash of sharp
intelligence, but the novel is finally a
collection of felicitous passages, not a
three-dimensional portrait of a woman.
We see the painter Renate in frag-
mentary glimpses from her Viennese
childhood to her later life in Mexico,
California, New York. Anais Nin has
tried to reveal Renate through her rela-
tionships with others, but is so fascinated
by the minor characters of the novel
(many of whom, admittedly, are dis-
sected with remarkable wit) that Renate
herself fades into the background. We're
left with a gallery of oddities instead of
a set of people acting as mirrors to give
back differing reflections of the central
character.
There is no criticism of the novel’s
disjointed structure in itself the title
after all is disarmingly explanatory
but a collage involves more than just the
assembling of a lot of bright and pretty
patches. They have to add up to a
pattern, with a central focus of interest
which gives meaning to the rest.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Extra Taxes for Defence?
A sobering anti-climax after the Federal Budget was the
Treasurer’s warning that extra taxes may be needed for
defence before the next Budget is due.
The £36.3m. increase in defence expenditure this year
seems small in comparison with commitments already under-
taken. There is growing agitation among Cabinet members
to sharpen Australia's defences. As a result, the Minister
for Defence, Senator S. D. Paltridge, is reported to be con-
sidering the introduction of a selective scheme of national
service training, plus the purchase of additional Army and
Navy equipment.
All this costs money and there is a growing fear that the
Treasurer may introduce a supplementary Budget.
Everyone remembers the Little Budget of a few years ago.
Investors, therefore, are entitled to be a little nervous at
the prospect of a supplementary Budget early next year, with
extra tax commitments as the main theme.
Such fears have some justification if taken in context with
the rising trend of Government commitments, which suggests
that the current and projected demand inflation will be aggra-
vated by more Government spending. At the same time, the
private sector is being squeezed with higher interest rates and
higher taxes.
The shortage of labor also will be aggravated if national
service denudes the ranks. Other possible problems include
a downturn in commodity prices, increased imports, and diffi-
cult export markets (notably, doubts about maintaining wheat
sales to Red China and Russia).
In such a climate, the warnings issued previously by The
Bulletin on strict attention to company earning rates have
greater significance.
Reserve Bank Report Warns
On Spending Trends
Jt should hardly be necessary at this stage to cry aloud the
merits of the Reserve Bank’s annual reports. Dr Coombs
is now probably furnishing the best single yearly surveys of
the Australian economy since the notable Tariff Board
annual reports of some eight or nine years ago.
His latest effort, covering the Bank’s 1963-64 year, provides
no exception and must be commended for study by all
businessmen.
Meanwhile it can be observed how largely the report agrees
with the overall economic assumptions in the recent Federal
Budget.
Yet Dr Coombs does not rest content with the successful
deployment of purely monetary weapons, which have so
distinguished the Reserve’s intervention throughout the economy
—especially in the reinstatement of more flexible interest rates.
He is disposed to feel “Events in 1963-64 suggested that
selective changes in policy, implemented promptly and appro-
priately in the light of changes in the demand for and supply
of liquid assets, can make an important contribution to
financial stability,” though remaining fully aware that 1963-64
was far from “a really explosive situation”.
“If and when more serious challenges arise, monetary
measures by themselves might well prove inadequate,” Dr
Coombs warns. Then comes a significant emphasis: “The
currently rising trend of expenditure, both on public and
private account, could present us with such a challenge.”
Parts of the present report breathe that concern over asset
values which also marked last year’s. “Recent large increases
in the supply of liquid assets had taken place while the
demand to hold wealth in liquid forms was strong. A decline
in this demand could lead to rises in the prices of less liquid
assets (thus encouraging speculative tendencies) and provide
stimulus to expenditures.”
In particular, Dr Coombs casts a cool eye on housing
finance, where Government encouragement has been very
obvious. Then, too, the great increase in savings bank deposits
lifted the rate of housing lending to high levels, “with a rising
proportion being channelled into finance for existing dwellings”.
The Reserve stresses “the desirability of gearing lending for
housing to the long-run expectations of growth in depositors’
balances and to the capacity of the (building) industry”.
Less Liquidity for
Trading Banks
tThre current period of dearer money is showing up in the
increasing tightness of bank credit. Outstanding over-
draft limits dropped by £5.5 million in July, while the ratio
of liquid assets and Government securities to deposits held by
the banks is at the lowest level for two years.
Naturally enough, the trading banks are being more critical
towards applications for bank overdraft credit. It seems
obvious this attitude will continue while liquidity falls.
Deposits with the banks still rose by £6m. in July. This,
however, fell far short of the average rise of £10.5m. which
has existed for the last ten years.
The Federal Government’s policy of higher interest rates is
influencing the trading bank clients with current accounts to
switch at least some of their money into fixed term bank
deposits, savings accounts, company debenture issues and Com-
monwealth bonds.
In general, the tighter monetary policy could have a restric-
tive influence on the flow of funds through current accounts,
forcing the banks to exercise further restraint in their lending
policies. It also suggests that the finance companies could
receive a re-channelling of customers.

tThiE argument about Australia’s exports of beef to the US
A reached a crescendo last week when Australia's Prime
Minister sent a personal letter to President Johnson and
included a hint that Australia may have to take retaliatory
action by banning US imports of tobacco, cigarettes, cotton
goods, harvesters and aircraft.
Sir Robert Menzies’ letter made reference to the proposed


Kennedy Round of tariff negotiations, designed to reduce
restrictions on trade, and pointed out that the proposed restric-
tion (to, perhaps, 204,000 tons) on imports of Australian beef
was in direct contradiction to the spirit of the Kennedy Round.
It also cuts across the existing quota agreement of 240,000 tons
for 1964. Recent estimates claim that Australia is unlikely
to ship more than 160,000 tons in 1964 anyway.
Although a compromise formula was arranged by the
Americans, it still imposes mandatory quotas on beef imports
if total imports rise beyond 362,000 short tons annually.
President Johnson, as a cattle man, is embarrassed by
domestic moves to protect beef prices in the US, since he
does not want to lose votes in an election year. Nevertheless,
he has indicated that he is against the imposition of strict
quotas on meat imports, particularly as an agreement had
already been signed with Australia last February to limit meat
shipments to the US.
The latest compromise quotas can be invoked by the
Secretary for Agriculture if he finds that imports are exceed-
ing 110 p.c. of the 1959-63 average, plus a growth factor of
16 p.c. There are additional escape clauses as well.
If export figures to the USA are kept within the quotas of
the February agreement, there
should be no cause for alarm
in the US, although it is obvious
that American cattlemen would
get much higher prices if there
were no imports from Australia,
New Zealand, Mexico and Ire-
land.
Certainly, if total export-
import figures are taken into
account, there is no broad
national argument to support the
case, because overall trade
figures show that Australia has
a deficit with the US. Quotas
already exist in the US on com-
modities like metals, sugar, etc.,
so it is hardly a good example
for promoting the Kennedy
Round when restrictions are in-
creased rather than reduced.
The US public is better off,
because it can buyer cheaper
beef. The domestic situation
centres on whether US cattle-
men should be guaranteed a
high price structure. On such purely parochial grounds, Aus-
tralia can’t cast stones, because of its own high-cost dairy
industry. It has a good argument, however, when presenting
its case in terms of total trade. From what is known of the
latest compromise, there are several “outs” permitted the
Americans for suspending or increasing quotas, based on
economic or national security. So it still appears that beef
exports are likely to cause more trouble if they show any
tendency to increase.
Monetary Fund Comforting
On World Liquidity
npHE International Monetary Fund’s Tokyo meeting, beginning
A on September 7, is unlikely to alter any of the existing
mechanisms of world liquidity. At the most, member nations’
quotas with the Fund will be increased for the first time
since 1959 and in the order of about 20 p.c.
Even this rather long-anticipated move may not become
effective until late in 1965, though it seems certain to contain
a helpful provision for a proportionately greater contribution
from scarce currencies, notably the German mark.
Australia’s Meat Exports to USA
Australia’s position as a result of American quotas on meat
imports is discussed in an article beginning on the previous page,
and prospects in the British market are examined in “Man on
the Land”, page 80. The above graph sets out beef and veal
exports to America.
The present mood of relative monetary conservatism has
sounded through many of the recent utterances by world
Finance Ministers. It receives general confirmation in the
lately released reports from the IMF and from the “Paris
Club” (a group of eleven major industrial countries).
As a matter of fact, the Club says straight out that “supplies
of gold and reserve currencies are fully adequate for the
present and are likely to be for the immediate future”. Fixed
exchange rates and the prevailing gold price duly get their
meed of praise.
Those views are, in the main, supported by the Fund’s sur-
vey, which, however, has also started to express some signifi-
cant doubts on future liquidity volume.
The Fund admits the situation of world trade increasing at
an annual average rate of 5.8 p.c. over the last ten years, while
reserves are growing by only 3.3 p.c.
Liquidity, in the Fund’s famous words, represents “all the
resources that are available to the monetary authorities of
countries for the purpose of meeting balance-of-payments
deficits”. Over the next few years these resources are not
expected to get much fillip from increasing monetary holdings
of gold and indeed will suffer from decreasing dollar supplies
if America solves its payments
problem.
So the Fund is at least forced
to one admission: “It therefore
seems safe to forecast that in
the future greater reliance than
over the past decade will have
to be placed on the provision
of international liquidity, as
needed, by other means.”
Perhaps the Club will also
come around to facing the
shadows of the future fairly
soon. For its report, sur-
prisingly, feels that international
liquidity “may possibly call for
some new form of reserve
asset”. Gold certificates and
even a composite currency unit
are to be examined.
While both reports appear
comfortably convinced about
the ruling levels of world
liquidity, they are at one in
believing that the gold con-
stituent in this liquidity could
quickly call for stimulus. Tokyo may yet see some mild
radicalism on the supply, if not the price, of gold!
Open Forum on Investment
Coming to Melbourne
VText February’s symposium on “Investment in Australia”,
organised and financed by the Stock Exchange of Mel-
bourne, should stimulate world-wide interest in Australia and
give a golden opportunity for a general airing of views.
The very fact that the papers to be presented cover the
most crucial points of investment today should create wide
controversy, supply reams of material for the Press and fur-
nish the opportunity for a certain amount of soul-searching
on the local scene. For the average Australian shareholder,
the discussions could be most interesting. On the schedule at
present there are five papers which should prove fascinating
to him a critical look at stockbroking and underwriting,
the problem of foreign domination of industry and mining in
particular, trends in company financing, legal protection for the
investor, and the challenge to the stock exchange.


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
The Tax Push on Prices
Some by-products of the taxation increases
Most economists would support the
general proposition that, in a state
of full employment of resources, a
Budget which increases taxation to the
point where practically all the additional
revenue is to be spent by the Govern-
ment will add to any inflationary pres-
sures already present in the system.
It will be appreciated that in elabora-
ting on this proposition a distinction
must be drawn between the pressures
behind price increases, that is, inflation-
ary pressures, and actual price increases
themselves. One is the fever, the other
is the rash. For instance, actual price
increases brought about simply by the
Government increasing sales tax or
excise duty on some product are not the
result of inflationary pressure. They are
a direct result of Government action.
However, such price increases can in
themselves add to inflationary pressures,
particularly those originating on the
supply side of the labor market from
the erosion of real wages by increases
in the cost of living.
The basic point is that although pound
for pound expenditure by the public may
or may not have the same effect on
prices as expenditure by the Govern-
ment (a subject which is too involved for
simple treatment here), the increase in
taxation required to give the Govern-
ment its extra pounds weakens the pub-
lic's power to maintain its spending
power and to finance its investment
courses under the existing price struc-
ture. The increase in taxation may still
leave some slack, which the public may
elect to take up. in current prices. Its
ability to get along, though, to maintain
its current position, is weakened all the
same with a consequent rise in pressure
on prices.
has been said before in this column,
the fact of the Government's
spending all (or nearly all) of the extra
revenue it filches from the private sector
will help to relieve this pressure on prices,
so far as it is exerted on the costs side.
This is because the additional Govern-
ment expenditure will mean increased
turnovers for businesses in the private
sector. Thus, the increase of 6d. in the
pound on company taxation could well
be offset to some extent as a result of an
improvement in profit margins, which,
other things being equal, might be ex-
pected from increasing industrial out-
puts and business turnovers.
The trouble here is that other things
may not be equal. For instance, the
higher charges for telephones will put
additional strain on profit margins (one
presumes that the Treasurer’s decision
not to increase petrol tax, which would
have had an erosive effect on profit
margins, was a concession to this point).
Or, taking a wider example, the net
effect of the taxation increases on wage
incomes could well increase pressure for
higher wages and increase industrial
costs in other ways, such as through
disruption of work. Industrial stop-
pages, particularly in the metal trades,
have already become a menace to pro-
fit margins and the Budget could well
aggravate the position.
/"|ne would have thought a primary ob-
jective of the Budget would have been
to avoid adding fuel to these flames. It
was always on the cards that the Trea-
surer would see one of his tasks to mop
up some of the additional spending
power generated as a result of the recent
increase in the basic wage. Indeed, most
people expected this and thought that
he had a pretty good chance of getting
away with it because of the urgency of
increasing defence expenditure. Well,
the Treasurer put on the sort of taxes
appropriate to a mopping-up operation.
With his other hand, however, he grabs
the additional revenue to spend it, not
so much on defence but on the whole
gamut of Government services and
works, without so much as a thought for
the economy’s need of a dampener.
This brings us to the question of ex-
cessive demand the other side of the
coin to cost-push inflation, on which the
theory that, in a full employment situa-
tion, increases in taxation will add to
inflationary pressures basically rests. Pre-
sumably in robbing Peter to pay Paul on
such a big new scale, the Treasurer is
not thinking too hard on the possibility
that excessive effective demand is going
to have a serious impact on prices this
year. By what route he has come to
such a conclusion is a mystery. Yet
in milking the additional incomes arising
from the basic-wage rise for more spend-
ing money, and So not taking anything
much to speak of out of circulation, he
would seem to be inviting not only cost-
push direct, but also additional pres-
sures from the demand side, which, at
one or more removes, would also lift
unit costs.
Except after they come out in rising
prices, pressures from the demand side
are not easy to measure. It is pretty
obvious —say from the record number of
motor vehicle registrations in July—
that demand is running exceptionally
strongly, with a big boost now to come
from the Government's £224 million
spending lift. Furthermore, behind such
evidence of record car sales, the build-up
of income generation shows no signs of
slackening. Indeed, it looks like the
contrary, as witness the continued buoy-
ancy of exports and industrial produc-
tion at the recently advanced wage levels.
Moreover, the income streams have yet
to get the full inflow from the current
investment upsurge in the private sector,
which is now to be supplemented by
another stiff increase in Federal capital
works.
A ll that doesn't necessarily add up to the
existence of surplus demand or even
of an impending one, because demand
is only one side of the equation. On the
other side, the supply of goods available
for demand to bite on has risen impres-
sively. In June, only two of the 35
items in the Statistician’s production list
showed a decline over June, 1963. Of
the others, eight were more than 30 p.c.
higher (big electric motors 75 p.c., motor
bodies 40 p.c., motor chassis 36 p.c.,
sulphuric and nitric acids 32 p.c. each,
pig-iron and cotton yarn both 31 p.c.,
and cotton cloth 30 p.c.). Seven others
were up more than 20 p.c. (rayon cloth,
floor coverings, commercial motor
vehicle chassis, internal combustion
engines, electric motors under 1 h.p.,
beer, and television sets). Of the other
big items, steel was up 19 p.c., bricks
and hardboard both 18, woollen yarn 17,
cement 14, and tobacco, cigars and
cigarettes 35 p.c.
supplies have been bolstered
by rising imports. With exports and
capital inflow continuing to run at high
levels, the almost record level of over-
seas reserves will ensure adequate funds
are available to keep a high stream of
imports flowing in. While there is a
limit to which imports can be financed
and also the scope for increasing local
industrial output is narrowed by the
labor shortage (some relief will come to
labor supplies from the high migrant
intake just announced), the Treasurer
has some grounds for looking ahead to
an even balance of supply and demand
in the economy at least for some months.
But the consumer price index will have
to be watched closely with a view to
taking dampening fiscal steps in case the
1 p.c. rise in the June quarter proves
to be the start of a rising price spiral.


“CROESUS”
Recasting Ideas on Decentralisation
Some surprises and contrasts in the Mallee
'l7'ictoria’s Mallee country is a place
" of surprises and contrasts. But any-
one looking for decentralisation potential
there, is likely to go away as disappointed
as one did last week, after a Shell spon-
sored pre-Melbourne Royal Show tour of
towns and farms in the area. Just as one
found recently with the country north of
Geraldton, in Western Australia, and on
three other Shell tours covering most of
Victoria’s country areas, the prospect of
thickening the Mallee with population
looks remote.
This is not to say that the Mallee,
once the home of rural heartbreaks and
lost causes, is, as we shall see, without
significant economic potential. Yet even
the residents in such places on the fringe
of the area, like Mildura and Swan Hill,
not to speak of those deeper in the heart
like Kerang, will tell you they have given
away any ideas of attracting important
secondary industry on which big popu-
lation growth could alone be founded. In
this, one felt the same sort of resignation
as in north-west WA, where the climate
for European settlement is far less con-
genial and the distance from metro-
politan markets infinitely greater.
As one has often felt before, even at
more likely places for secondary industry
development in country areas (say, in
the Latrobe Valley and Portland, even
Wangaratta and Bendigo), prophets see-
ing big cities arising outside Melbourne,
Dandenong and Geelong could be star-
gazing and their fellows in other States
likewise. It could be time for us to recast
our ideas on regional development
throughout the whole of Australia.
T>ossibly we should stop pretending to
pursue high population growth out-
side a handful of coastal cities, even in
Victoria, where intensive regional popu-
lation growth is more feasible than in
any other State, and throw the weight of
our enterprise and capital into the de-
velopment of rural and mineral resources
in these areas. If we do this, we cannot
expect droves of people to follow such
development. The corollary, which also
would have to be accepted, is an even
greater concentration of population in
the State capitals and some other already
rapidly expanding cities like Wollongong,
for instance, developing on the basis of
secondary industry, outside them.
It would seem to be time, in fact, for
a better definition of regional develop-
ment aims based on the dichotomy of
primary and secondary resources poten-
tial, with perhaps a further extension to
the inevitable increasing reliance on ter-
tiary industries for the build-up of popu-
lation. Once this is done, the paths of
future national development in terms of
resources and population will become a
lot clearer.
Surprises are many in the Mallee.
The mastery of the erosion problem, the
ingenuity shown in conquering the pro-
fusion of salt which has emerged in sur-
face soil after inefficient irrigating
methods, the rolling-back of huge areas
of Mallee scrub with heavy chains and
crawler tractors, the euthanasia of the
small and even marginal farmer, the in-
creasing advent of big “industrial” farm-
ing depending on maximum mechanisa-
tion and a bare handful of men, giant
earthworks slicing off hills down to the
clay sub-soil to harvest water to relieve
dependence on irrigation channels. In
short, even if the big man arrived in the
Mallee many years ago, the big men are
getting bigger, more scientific, more in-
dependent of the vagaries of nature and
thus more efficient, prolific.
Vou are also surprised, possibly not
having done the necessary homework,
to find that some of this former scrub
country is now the best fat-lamb area in
Victoria. You will see the old-time grain
elevators as small yellow blotches on the
horizon and, not far away, new million-
bushel aluminium models which are pat-
terned in a series through the eastern
Mallee. Where you least expect it are
helicopters spraying weedkiller over
crops, freshwater lakes and dams
a’plenty to succor the thirsting country-
side, dairy herds and stud cattle which
have taken the highest RAS ribbons in
the land, and giant Clydesdales which,
one imagined, had gone out years ago.
Then there are the contrasts. Water
dictates everything in these areas where
rainfall is scarce one farmer said he
had had only four inches so far this year.
So, for contrast, out Ouyen way, you get
the old, untamed Mallee, out of reach
of the water channels running back to
back with vast areas under cultivation.
You see that, given success with current
experiments in water harnessing from the
clay sub-soil, there is no visible limit to
the scope for rolling back the dirty
country and making even more broad
green acres (green, that is, at this time
of the year).
T)ossibly the biggest contrasts are seen
* in the variety of produce found on in-
dividual farms. This gives as good a clue
as any to the huge agricultural potential
of the Mallee, where, possibly for want
of anything better to fill their time,
settlers have more sidelines than one
could have imagined. One farm near
Swan Hill owned by Mr I. McLean,
whose main product looked at first glance
to be Angus beef cattle, makes more
money harvesting lettuce seeds, and for
good measure produces wine, grapes,
dried fruits, peaches, wool, fat lambs,
wheat —to speak of only a few of its
harvests. As one settler told me, you
start off by taking an interest, say, in
goats as a hobby. In no time it becomes
a profitable sideline. No matter what
property you visit, you will find its main
product only one of many.
At Mildura, on a 200-acre property
owned by Cr A. Mansell, MLA, the
biggest vineyard in this part of the world
and one where the operations are all
highly mechanised, even to pruning the
vines, you also find a fine herd of Angus
cattle. Some 90 miles to the south-east,
near Ouyen, on an 18,000-acre place
which is about half cleared, a Mr J. A.
Vallence, with the help of a couple of
hands, cultivates 4,000 acres of wheat,
herds about 200 steers and runs some
2,000 sheep, besides carrying out what
is probably the biggest scrub-land clear-
ing operation in Victoria.
In fact, given the necessary water,
there is apparently no temperate-zone
agricultural product Mallee land cannot
grow. But while water sets limits, so
does capital. In Valence’s view and
he studied the question intensively for
fifteen years before he took the plunge
into highly capitalised mechanised farm-
ing near Ouyen there is no future
very far from the Murray for any other
sort of farming. For anybody interested,
there are plenty of untamed acres left.
But newcomers require a mind for
machines and an appetite for hard work
and solitude, as well as a stack of money.

Battery Makers Set New Records
Rising raw material costs trim profits , raise prices
Australian storage battery manufac-
turers are not worried about any
adverse effect the extra 2i p.c. sales tax
on motor cars, announced in the Budget,
will have on production of motor
vehicles. Their market, they say, is
assured as long as there are vehicles on
the road.
They are not happy, though, about
steadily increasing costs of raw materials.
These cost rises are paring their profits
to the extent that a price rise is “immi-
nent”, according to at least two manu-
facturers.
A strongly competitive business, the
battery industry has gone from strength
to strength, with the infamous “little
Budget” of November, 1960, barely
checking its progress. Production for the
last four years has been as follows:
Automotive batteries ’ooo’s
Year 6 volt 12 volt Total
1960- 604 839 1443
1961- 555 888 1443
1962- 592 1100 1692
1963- 526 1083 1609
(11 mths)
Most motor-car manufacturers today
prefer 12 volt to 6 volt electrical systems,
because of the greater efficiency
the higher voltage allows and
because of the smaller equip-
ment needed to operate on 12
volts. It means less wiring costs,
too.
Based on present production
levels, output for the full 1963-
64 year should well exceed
1962-63, thereby setting a new
record. Production of other
types of storage batteries for
industry and rural use (for
lighting, power, etc.) should also
reach a new high, although
actual figures are not compiled.
The battery manufacturers’
biggest market is in replace-
ment, not new equipment. For
the first five months of this
calendar year, 159,485 new
motor vehicles were registered
and approximately 10,000 new tractors
sold. Even taking into account the fact
that some of these vehicles use two or
more batteries, production of batteries
for the same period far outstripped new
motor vehicle registrations and new
tractor sales. From January to May
this year, 758,700 6 and 12 volt batteries
were produced.
The average life of batteries, say manu-
facturers, is about three years. From
figures supplied by the Commonwealth
Statistician, it appears that nearly 75 p.c.
of vehicles on Australian roads are more
than three years old. At the end of
1963, there were 3,392,044 registered
motor vehicles in Australia, almost
2,544,000 three years or older.
The replacement side of the business
is obviously the meat in the battery
manufacturers’ sandwich. Any effect the
higher sales tax on cars has on their new
equipment sales will be offset by the in-
creasing business ageing cars and bat-
teries will provide. A decrease in motor
vehicle production, however, is unlikely,
say both the battery makers and car
makers, since the sales tax adds only
fractionally to the overall cost of the
vehicle.
Mr A. A. Luciano, managing director
of Century Storage Battery Co. Ltd, put
it this way: “If the increased sales tax
does discourage some people from buy-
ing a new car, they will hold on to their
old one and will probably have to buy a
new battery at some stage. The extra
2i p.c. will have a negligible effect.”
Century, a large maker of storage
batteries, supplies the whole of Chrys-
ler’s requirements for their Chrysler,
Dodge, Valiant and Simca cars, as well
as batteries under different names for
Storage battery output
other distributors. Mr Luciano says the
company’s production of batteries, both
for automotive and other uses, at present
is about 300,000 a year.
Rising costs of raw materials worry
him. “The industry has been hit with
high lead prices—they’ve gone from £75
to £135 a ton. The price of antimony
has also risen. (In London the price has
risen from £23ostg a ton to £391 lOs.stg
a ton, the present price, in the last 12
months. It has risen by £9ostg a ton
since April this year.) These increased
raw material prices, as well as the higher
cost of labor, have already caused in-
creased prices to consumers and further
rises are imminent. We have been
able to absorb a lot of the increased
costs, but now we have reached satura-
tion point.”
Century will shortly put on the market
the first color batteries in Australia. Says
Mr Luciano: “We have made rapid al-
vances in battery techniques in Austra-
lia. There is nothing more we can do at
the moment to improve quality and effi-
ciency. We therefore believe the best
thing to do is to dress the battery up.
Car-concious people are going to like
color batteries instead of the old black
box. The idea has already caught on in
the US and most manufacturers there
are now producing color batteries.
“Batteries today have been designed
to give much more output, and they have
been balanced to give a more constant
service. The greater efficiency of the stor-
age battery today has been caused by
better formulation of the materials used.
The use of additives to antimonial lead
for the manufacture of grids has reduced
the liability of the grid to corrosion dur-
ing service.
“We have found the use of
another additive, cobalt, in our
batteries lengthens the life by
from a third to a half as much
again. The use of cobalt in
batteries will become more
necessary with the advent of
the alternator rather than the
generator on cars. With alter-
nators the tendency is to over-
charging rather than under-
charging. Cobalt gives the
plates a longer life.”
Century exports approxi-
mately 5 p.c. of its production,
major markets being Malaysia,
Singapore, Hong Kong, Trini-
dad, Lebanon, Colombo, Fiji,
the Solomon Islands and New
Guinea. It won the 1963
Hoover award for export. It
has established a battery factory
in Malaya under that country’s Pioneer
Industries Relief Act of 1959 which
entitles a pioneer industry to three to
five years tax-free trading, depending on
capital invested. It exports battery parts
to the factory for assembly, whereas
previously it exported the finished pro-
duct.
Total exports of batteries and accumu-
lators from Australia is rising strongly-
For the year ended June we exported

Electrification of country areas by
State electricity authorities has caused a
slight decrease in the demand for bat-
teries for home lighting and power. A
spokesman for one battery company said
extension of the electricity grids in Vic-
toria and NSW had reduced demand for
domestic batteries in those States. In
States like Western Australia, South Aus-
tralia and Queensland, where population
is smaller and more spread out, sales are
showing an increase.
Technical developments have meant
increasing sales of industrial batteries.
The growth in the coalmining industry,
where batteries are used underground to
lessen the risk of explosion due to a
spark and where internal combustion
engines are useless because of the toxic
fumes they produce, has helped these
sales. A large buyer of industrial bat-
teries is the Post Office, which uses them
in switchboards and as standby units.
An executive of Associated Battery
Makers of Australia Pty Ltd, which
makes batteries under several trade
names, said the industrial battery was a
very important part of his company’s
business. “There has been an upsurge
in the demand for battery - operated
equipment, especially with the increasing
use of forklift trucks in closed-in areas.
Battery equipment is cheaper to operate
than petrol or diesel engines, although
the initial cost is high.”
The executive said recent increases in
battery prices were the first the industry
had imposed for ten years. “The high
price of lead and other raw materials
caused these increases. We cannot ,cut
the use of lead in batteries any further
because we now have an optimum
balance between lead content and per-
formance. To reduce the lead content
any further would impair performance.
High profits have not been available in
the industry for many years. It is
only greater efficiency that has enabled
manufacturers to contain costs up to
now.”
Marshall Batteries Pty Ltd depends
entirely on the replacement market for
its sales. None of its production goes
into new equipment. “The replacement
field is completely different from new
business as we deal completely with the
end user of our product, whereas the
new equipment supplier sells direct to
the car manufacturer,” said an executive.
Marshall’s marketing technique could
be compared with that of John Bloom,
the British washing-machine king, who
before his empire collapsed, sold direct
to the consumer, thus eliminating the
middle man’s profits. “For this reason,”
said the executive, “we have great trouble
convincing people we are selling quality
for such a low price.”
The executive forecast that a trend
now being set in America could reach
Australia shortly. “There the battery
manufacturers are encouraging people to
change their batteries every 26 months,
whether or not it is still operating. The
industry says it pays the consumer in
the long run because it almost completely
cuts out breakdowns. It argues that it
costs less to replace four months earlier
than necessary.”
He also forecast a smaller and con-
sequently lighter car battery with the use
of the alternator. “The alternator is
eventually going to make possible a small-
er battery. It keeps the battery charging
even when the engine is idling the
DC generator cannot do this. Batteries
today are lasting considerably longer
than they used to because of improved
technology and better electrical systems
in the cars,” the executive added.

MARKET POINTERS
Commodity Prices Ease
Since the Vietnam crisis went off the
boil metal prices have eased. As a
result, some profit-taking occurred in
lead-zinc shares.
Other flash-points have been given a
new spark, such as Cyprus and Malaysia,
but the public has been conditioned to
these situations.
Commodity speculators, also, may
become less jumpy with the spreading of
war threats over various areas which, so
far, have been contained as “little wars”.
★ ★ ★
rriHE price of EZ Industries shares last
week hardened in anticipation of
what must be a good result for 1963-64,
but the fall in lead-zinc prices on over-
seas commodity markets induced a more
cautious tone.
★ ★ ★
llTapet's Barrow Island oil tests were
” encouraging. Although the oil flows
were not spectacular, there is a good
chance that the extensive levels of oil
sands will justify commercial production.
The market evidently had anticipated
more than a 667 barrels a day flow rate,
because Ampol Exploration failed to
respond to the announcement. It all
takes time.
★ ★ ★
FThe Alton well in Queensland, drilled
by the Union-Kern-AOG group, re-
covered 480 barrels a day in a two-
hour test and interest now centres on
nearby drilling on a step-out basis.
With so many encouraging oil pros-
pects these days, however, oil specula-
tors are becoming blase.

expecting improved results from
-*■ the banks this year were not disap-
pointed by the result from the CBC of
Sydney, which lifted its earning rate from
12.8 to 16.6 p.c. and raised its dividend
from 9i to 10 p.c. The savings bank
and CAGA, the hire-purchase subsidiary,
made vital contributions to earnings.
However, increased interest rates and
higher buying charges must have their
effect throughout the banking system.
The only problem at the moment is whe-
ther the Treasury will be even more
restrictive with its monetary policy and
impose further credit controls on the
banks.
★ ★ ★
Everhot, the Melbourne-
based manufacturers of hot-water
services, cooking ranges and space
heaters, looks set for big things this year.
The Bulletin of July 18 (p. 61) first
pointed out these possibilities when dis-
cussing whether the bonus dividend
would be maintained in the current year
(it was 2i p.c. and lifted the payout to
a record 12\ p.c.).
Going by comments from the chair-
man (Mr R. A. Draffin) in the recent
annual report, directors also feel that
this year will be really good. He says
a new toilet flushing system will add
considerably to turnover. Overall costs
should be reduced and finish improved
by certain plant additions which have
been going on.
All this will help things in the right
direction, especially as the company is
worried over increased charges because
of the basic wage rise and changes in
long-service leave. On present indica-
tions, the bonus dividend should prove
more than just a birthday gift.


SHARE OPTION TRADING
BECOMING POPULAR
Option dealing on stocks and shares, long
used in England and America to achieve
profit and safeguard investment decisions is
rapidly growing in Australia.
To give a simple example . . . You arrange
an option to buy the certain shares within a
specified period. If the shares rise at some
time during this period you exercise your
option, thereby obtaining the shares at the
lower price prevailing when the option was
arranged.
If the shares do not rise you let your option
expire. The only cost is the small premium
paid for the option.
The various methods of profiting from Put
and Gall Options are fully explained in a

INVESTMENT SECTION
Quest for Higher Earnings
Australian Fertilizers relies on expansion
and bad news rolled in for Aust-
ralian Fertilizers’ shareholders last
week The good news was a share issue
for expansionary purposes (discussed in
The Bulletin of August 15, p. 67),
which is to be made on much more
generous terms than even the best-in-
formed market observers were expecting.
It will be a three-for-five and the 20s.
units will carry only a 7s. 6d premium.
Although something like three-for-five
was expected (The Bulletin suggested
a one-for-two, which, after all, isn’t so
far off), the premium is way below any
of the estimates. Most were closer to
20s. Seeing £3.2 million has to be raised
from various sources, and shareholders
would have to be the main source, ob-
servers figured a large premium would be
necessary to avoid any too substantial
boost in paid capital. This is obviously
not the directors’ thinking. As a result,
there will be substantial capital gains
for shareholders, whose scrip was fetch-
ing 85s. before any news of the issue
was known.
Mixed in with this good news was the
bad and it may have a detrimental
effect on ex-issue prices, thus reducing
capital gains. Profit in 1963-64 went up
from £201,000 to £255,000. However, no
tax was necessary thanks to the Govern-
ment’s investment allowance. Last year,
tax took nearly £lOO,OOO. So, in effect,
pre-tax profits fell from about £300,000
to £255,000 this year. The situation may
not be quite as bad as it looks, due to
the fact that depreciation took £260,000
£90,000 more than last year.
Moreover, the factors which reduced
trading profits, despite sales increases,
may not exist this year. Costs rose sub-
stantially as production facilities were
straining to meet what directors call an
unforeseeable demand increase. Industrial
unrest hampered output and also lifted
costs. In addition, the new phosphoric
and ammonium plants were commis-
sioned late and operated at losses for the
year. The current year should see a less-
ening of these problems and possibly
better pre-tax earnings.
What of the future? What happens
when tax concessions can no longer be
claimed? The effect on earning rates
could be devastating if no extra money is
earned on capital increased by a three-
for-five issue, and possibly further by
share placements to help raise expansion-
ary finance. The 16 p.c. to 18 p.c. earn-
ings of recent years could take a substan-
tial knock. Even the regular 8 p.c. divi-
dend may be endangered.
It is to be hoped that directors have
planned for the expansionary moves to
become profitable to an extent which will
easily overshadow lost tax concessions
once the new sulphuric acid plant at
Port Kembla is completed (within two
years). Unless more building goes on
after this, tax will rise heavily. Profit
boostings must then rely on profits from
Port Kembla and the other main ex-
pansionary plan to double superphos-
phate production by 1966.
In the long term, the moves can't help
but be successful and highly profitable.
It is just the next three years which will
see earning rates swinging rather pre-
cariously in the balance.
All That Glisters . . .
]V|ount Morgan Ltd’s announcement
of increased, almost trebled, profit
did not excite the market. Following the
news of an increase in profit of from
£182,613 to £466,292 and a 150 p.c.
increase in dividend (5 p.c. to 12! p.c.
including bonus), the shares fell from
19s. 9d. to 19s. 4!d. They have since re-
covered to 19s. 6d.
A commendable result, indeed. In the
possible event of a ceiling being set on
base-metal prices, the market exercised a
degree of caution. It was undoubtedly
world prices, together with better win-
nings, that enabled Mt Morgan to turn
in its best result for years.
During the year to June 28, the com-
pany treated about 8 p.c. more ore,
causing a rise in gold production from
56,045 ounces to 70,210 ounces and in
copper from 7146 tons to 8092 tons.
Regarding the dividend, directors say:
“The bonus marks the return to im-
proved results.” Actual construction is as
follows interim 6d., final 6d. plus 3d.
bonus. This compares with last year’s in-
terim 6d. and no final “to conserve
funds”.
The latest result is after depreciation
of £163,375 (last year £100,922) and
£41,759 expenditure on advance over-
burden removal charged to production
costs (nothing last year). Again no pro-
vision for taxation was necessary. Assets
sold during the year realised £1958,
which is included in the profit.
Intending investors should remember
that the spiral of world metal prices
could be arrested.
Big Gains from Straehan
Tt would have been hard to find a better
A buy than Straehan and Co. last
November. The company is a Geelong
(Vic.) woolbroker. Last December, a
two-for-five bonus issue was made. Near
the end of July, it was announced that
dividend for 1963-64 would be raised
from 12! p.c. to 13! p.c.—bonus shares
participating in the final payout.
This heralded the colossal profit result
announced last week. Few people ex-

pected such a boomer. Up 44 p.c. from
£58,000 to £84,000, profit represents an
improvement in the earning rate from
27.3 p.c. to 28.7 p.c. on much higher
capital. Capital benefits have been huge
for shareholders, especially as the scrip is
now only a few shillings below its pre-
bonus price of 625.
Transport and Delight
Directors of F. H. Stephens (Consoli-
dated) leave no doubts that they
expect the run of road transporters’
successes to keep on. Following a record
1963-64 profit, the company plans a one-
for-four issue specifically to provide
funds for development.
Shareholders may feel particularly
gratified that the issue, the first since
1962 listing, is made at par. The ss.
shares are selling around a top 255.,
having advanced clearly on last year's
top 17s. 3d.
Stephens, which embraces thriving
Customs and shipping activities too, joins
the group of transport profit increases
earlier reported by TNT, Brambles and
Yellow Express Carriers.
The latest earnings went up from
£159,887 to £218,021, to give a 30.2 p.c.
earning rate on end-of-year capital. The
steady 10 p.c. dividend, taking only
£72,109, is to be held on post-issue
capital.
The issue will actually raise £180,274,
bringing paid capital to £901,370. Divi-
dend commitments don't look like im-
posing much of a strain at the current
rate of earning.
Not Flash in the Pan
one-for-four premium issue to be
made by A. V. Wehl Industries to
finance continued expansion augurs well
for the future. It possibly indicates that
the company’s bumper result in its first
public year to June 30 will be no flash
in the pan.
Despite the big 32.3 p’.c. earning rate
(20 p.c. in 1962-63) and the 121 p.c.
dividend (prospectus predicted only 10
p.c.), many have been sceptical about
the company’s ability to maintain such
a performance, seeing it was basically
tied to high activity in the building in-
dustry. Wehl distributes laminated plas-
tics and flakeboard (under franchise
from APPM) and manufactures about
6000 bathroom “vanity” units annually.
Admittedly the 1964 result has created
a difficult precedent for those years when
the building industry is slack, but the
issue, for further expansion, indicates the
directors’ faith in the 1964-65 year at
least. Their statement that the 121 p.c.
will be continued after the issue indi-
cated confidence over a much longer
term. It must not be forgotten that Wehl
is not tied wholly and solely to the build-
ing industry as, say, a timber company
may be.
The expansion plans and the issue may
not mean much to a critical viewer. In
fact, it may make him even more critic-
al if he believes that Wehl is merely
using the current high market prices on
its shares to make hay while the sun
shines. This view is backed up by the
fact that a big ss. premium has been
tacked on to the ss. par. If nothing else,
though, the moves definitely take the
1964 result out of the “flash in the pan”
class.
Bright Hotel Spot
An oasis in the desert of depressing
reports from city hotels is the Hotel
Metropole’s preliminary statement. It
brings news of a record profit, despite
increased expenditure and a higher tax
provision based on the increased rates
announced in the Budget.
At the northern end of Sydney and not
far from one of its competitors, the
Australia, which announced a big slump
in earnings recently, the Metropole en-
joys a large year-round country clien-
tele. This factor no doubt influenced
the lift in profit from £90,041 in 1962-63
(15.9 p.c. on capital) to the latest record
result of £93,630 (16.6), enabling direc-

Important moves lie ahead for some of these*
TRENDEX is noting them.
MARKET MOVES:
The main business of this Firm is the
management of portfolio investment for
substantial clients. In choosing stocks
for investment and recommending
stocks for sale due regard is paid to
Company performance, balance sheet
features, the growth or decline in earn-
ings per share, and the like. However,
we also recognise that the market move-
ment of a stock may be quite at variance
with the apparent company merit. Ac-
cordingly, we recommend sound company
stocks for purchase only if market evid-
ence indicates independently that the
{>rice is likely to move upwards. Similar-
y, notwithstanding apparent company
merit, we are inclined to recommend the
sale of stocks which appear likely to en-
counter substantial market deteriora-
tion.
The methods which we use in forecast-
ing market behaviour were developed
for use in Australia exclusively by this
Firm. To bring them to the notice of
investors at large, we began to publish
Trendex several years ago. Subscribers
receive a book describing and illustrat-
ing the techniques, so that they can
apply them for themselves, and many in-
vestors are doing this with success. Sub-
scribers also receive, each week, the
latest issue of Trendex, describing cur-
rent examples, and following through on
the hundred or more stocks kept under
constant supervision therein.
In the current issue of Trendex, we are
closely examining those stocks mention-
ed above, some of which have arrived at
the market cross-roads. Trendex is noted
for pointing out major changes in the
price trend of individual stocks, well
ahead of these changes becoming accept-
ed by the general run of brokers and
investors.
A.P.M.:
Although the Company report for the
1959 year, and the interim report to
31/12/60 were both showing record pro-
fits and sales, and notable expansion
plans, market weakness had already set
in. The price of the stock was halved
from 40/- to 20/- during the next eigh-
teen months. A clear reversal to an up-
ward trend took place soon afterwards,
and our clients who had sold around
40/-, acted on the signals which were
published in Trendex and accumul-
ated the stock again between 20/- and
24/-. A.P.M. has now'risen to 38/-, and
is trading between 38/- and 36/-. This
is equivalent to around 46/- before the
bonus. Again, we have reports of record
results, improved dividend, and major
expansion plans. Is history repeating it-
self? Has the market reached a top for
A.P.M. once more? The Trendex picture
is illuminating.
Trendex subscribers sold this stock
around 70/- in 1962, because of the
bearish signals being given on our
charts, and the price target of 49/- was
achieved towards the end of the year.
Prices then departed from the down-
ward pattern, and moved up to 60/- in
February and March last. Since then,
prices have eased back again, and the
position is critical once more. Should
you be buying now, for another advance,
or should you be selling?
E. Z. INDUSTRIES:
Having sold at high prices a year or two
earlier, our clients purchased this stock
again between 14/- and 12/- in 1962,
for reasons which were described in
Trendex. As prices later churned around
19/6, we published a target figure of
25/6, to be achieved in August this year.
It is now August, and sales have taken
place at 25/6. What now? Is it time to
sell, or should one hold?
HOWARD SMITH:
This stock has had a splendid run from
42/- to as high as 68/- (ex-bonus) since
early last year. This run has taken the
form of a series of sharp advances, with
moderate declines in between. Is the
present decline to around 60/- the pre-
paration for a further smart advance,
or is it a selling signal? The signs are
clear, and fully described in the latest
issue of Trendex.
HERALD & WEEKLY TIMES:
This stock is high—nearly twelve times
par. They said it was too high at eight
times par! Will Herald keep going on,
or is a sizeable shakeout just around the
corner? After all, even the best stocks
take their tumbles. Market action is
telling the story for Herald, and we spell
it out in Trendex.
C.S.R.:
This is a stock that takes no half mea-
sures. After a beautiful ride up to £92
(now 92/-) where selling signals were
given, prices took a severe tumble to
below 50/- in 1962, more than fulfilling
the targets set in Trendex. When Trend-
ex gave the signal to buy again around
60/- last year, targets of 79/- and then
88/- were set, and the reasons given.
Prices moved forward and spent about
three months between 78/- and 80/-,
and then advanced to a high point of
89/9. Sales have eased back. Do we go
on upwards from here, or is it time to
sell, once more? Market action is telling
the story.
DRUG HOUSES:
After Trendex subscribers sold D.H.A,
at around 68/- just twelve months ago,
sales dropped smartly to 54/-, and have
continued to drift to present levels of
around 46/-. What is the outlook now?
Is this the time to buy, or is there worse
to come?
TRENDEX DOESN’T HEDGE:
Trendex states the conclusions from
market action bluntly, and without
hedging. All the stocks mentioned above
are discussed in the current issues of
Trendex and scores of others too.

tors to continue the 14 p.c. dividend
established the previous year.
The company incurred additional
expense of £15,000 on repairs to the
restaurant and room-service kitchens.
Tax provision increased from £60,400 to
£68.770 and depreciation rose from
£15,716 to £17,805.
It will be interesting to see whether the
Metropole can continue its good record
with a closer competitor, Qantas, open-
ing its international hotel at the end of
next year, even though the Metropole has
only a small international patronage.
The 20s. shares, now at 40s. and
yielding 7 p.c., are below the high earlier
this year of 475. 6d.
Cat Still in the Bag
Prowler’s Vacola directors fell short
of what was expected of them at the
recent annual meeting in Melbourne.
They failed to tell shareholders what
degree of profitability the company had
enjoyed since balance date, April 30.
The Bulletin of August 15 (p. 77)
stressed the need for a statement along
these lines, seeing the first loss for 44
years was incurred in 1963-64. In the
second half of the year trading was
profitable, but not enough to recoup the
first half's loss.
Trading is still believed to be produc-
ing a profit this year. However, an in-
dication of the rate of earning is impera-
tive if shareholders are to be permitted
to accurately evaluate their holdings on
the market. Without some knowledge of
this, they can’t even guess if the 1963-64
dividend, paid from reserves, will be
continued, discontinued, reduced or in-
creased.
They are still in the dark completely.
All they know is that sales have risen,
profits have been budgeted for, and that
a “great deal of progress” has been made
towards this budget. A “great deal of
progress” does not mean that the goal
has been attained. Maybe the future
interim report will throw some light.
Surely, though, directors could at least
let them know what the budgeted figure
was at the annual meeting.
Undoubtedly things are going all right,
yet there will be a state of suspense for
some time now until the exact degree of
recovery is known.
Lively Olding
A nother recipient of the present trans-
porting liveliness is Olding Equip-
ment, which enters this area through the
manufacture of truck bodies and haulage
fittings. The company nearly trebled
profit in the latest year, lifting earnings
from £20,585 to £55,955 —far in excess
of any prior period.
Shareholders benefit directly, for the
dividend moves from 8 to 10 p.c., thus
being restored to the level applying in
1960 and 1961.
Earning rate becomes a healthy 33.7
p.c. Both manufacturing and merchan-
dising operations expanded throughout
1963-64, directors report.
The 20s. shares have risen to 325.,
after their previous 1964 peak of 31s.
They now yield 6.3 p.c.
Frozen Food’s Tasty Year
fPHE encouraging result from Frozen
-*• Food Industries for the year to
June 30 came as no surprise. Share-
holders have known all along exactly
how the company is faring, thanks to
detailed half-yearly and quarterly reports
from the directors.
The year was Frozen Food’s first as
a public company and produced earnings
of 18.1 p.c., from which a 10 p.c. divi-
dend will be distributed. That reflects
well against the prospectus, which pre-
dicted earnings of “at least 15 p.c.” and
forecast a dividend of only 9 p.c.
Trading has moved off on the right foot
for the current year. July turnover was
in excess of budget estimates, to use the
directors’ terminology.
Sales expanded 43 p.c. to £742,000
during the year. A continuance of this
trend may necessitate a call on share-
holders in the near future for expan-
sionary capital. Frozen snack foods are
distributed in all States as well as Papua.
The company operates six self-service
ice stations in Melbourne and distributes
Coffees’ frozen foods in Victoria.
“Chiko” rolls are probably one of its
better known, non-frozen snack foods.
A meat-boning plant quick freezes meat
for export and general cold storage
facilities also form part of the group’s
activities.
Spinning into a Pickle
Melbourne-based cotton spinning
and textile group, Davies Coop, is
really fighting an uphill battle which is
far from finished. Despite the fantastic
profit lift from £13,000 to £281,000 in
the year to June 30, ordinary share-
holders are still in a pickle.
Consider the record—l96o, £120,000
loss; 1961, £44,000 profit; 1962,
£126,000 loss; 1963, £13,000 profit; and
now, 1964, £281,000 profit. No ordin-
ary dividend went out in any of these
years. The last was 121 p.c. in 1958-
59, from a profit which represented 14
p.c. on capital. The latest result equals
only 6 p.c. on ordinary capital, after
deducting preference dividends of
£lB,OOO. Ordinary shares will again
collect nothing.
The key to the problem is the volu-
minous conversion of notes into share
capital. Last December, paid ordinary
capital was boosted from £3.2 million

to £4.3 million by such a conversion.
Without this, the latest result would have
been about 8 p.c. on capital and a small
dividend would have been covered. Even
without a dividend, undistributed profits
would have received a much bigger boost
in relation to capital.
For 1964-65, the outlook is just as
gloomy. This December, another con-
version is due which will boost paid
ordinary capital to £5.6 million. To
earn something reasonable on this, say
10 p.c., profit would have to be doubled.
What a task! It seems that ordinary
shareholders will get nothing until at
least 1965-66. Even then, substantial
profit lifts will have to be chalked up
if a payout is to be warranted, or be of
any worthwhile size.
Bellamhi Records
Another pleasing profit story comes
from Bellambi Coal Co. Ltd, which
turned in a record result for the year to
June 30 a 69.2 p.c. increase to
£120,442. Not as good an increase as
the previous year, when profit rose 82.3
p.c. With a record, though, who wants
to argue?
Australia’s improved position in the
world coal market must undoubtedly
have helped results. The new coal loader
at Port Kembla, which started operations
in January, assists exports of high quality
hard-coking coal from the Bulli field
and renewed contracts, for increased
tonnages for export to Japan’s steel in-
dustry, put a gloss on future prospects.
Bellambi’s latest results are arrived at
after providing £13,240 for tax (nil last
year) and £207,349 (£174,329) for
depreciation. Two new provisions were
included this year £60,972 for major
overhauls and replacements and £52,908
for deferred tax.
The steady dividend of 10 p.c. returns
2.9 p.c. on the current price of 17s.
Prelude to Takeover?
Johns and Waygood’s purchase
of a 27i p.c. interest in Sargeants
Engineering be a prelude to bigger things
-—like takeover? The possibility may
be small, but it is most definitely in
existence. J. and W. is a Melbourne-
based structural, mechanical and lift
engineer. It operates through subsidiaries
in all capital cities, plus Newcastle.
Sargeants is a Brisbane-based com-
pany. On the stock market it is re-
garded as a company with a promising, in
fact glowing, future. An association
between the two companies would un-
doubtedly provide considerable mutual
benefits.
The interest was not acquired directly
from the company, although Sargeants’
directors knew what was going on.
Shares and rights to the recent new issue
were bought. A takeover may provide a
shot in the arm for J. and W., whose
results have been rather stagnant over
recent years.
In the latest year to June 30, earnings
equalled 16.2 p.c. on capital. Previous
highest was 16.7 in 1960. In 1961 and
1962 they were 15.9 and 14.7 p.c., and
last year 15.9 p.c. again. Not very
exciting. Dividends have been 10 p.c.
all that time. In fact, the only real high-
light was a one-for-five par issue in 1961
—as far as shareholders are concerned
anyway.
Better Turn for Ferris
T ast year’s quite positive improvement
by Ferris Industries, TV appliance
and car radio manufacturer, has been
bettered for 1963-64. The latest earn-
ings, at £55,900, jump £21,611 ahead of
1962-63’s and also show a decided ad-
vance on the 1959-60 profit of £44,252
made immediately before the company’s
slump began.
Earning rate goes up from 12.9 p.c.

to a much happier 21 p.c. Directors,
therefore, can’t have had any hesitation
in lifting dividend by 2 p.c. to 8 p.c.,
after the previous year’s 1 p.c. increase.
Ferris has certainly shed all its old
bad-debts incubus and organisationally
now seems right on the ball. Sales were
raised by 26.5 p.c. during 1963-64,
while the first few weeks of the current
year moved up on the corresponding
period of 1962-63.
Not too much additional vulnerability
appears to have been thrust upon the TV
and motor-car markets as a result of the
recent Budget imposts. So Ferris should
be able to hold its position, at least.

this year’s best and stands above last

Vigorous Independent
F'ement sales by Adelaide Cement
Holdings Ltd in South Australia
during the year to June 30, 1964, were
reported as 430,478 tons. Compare this
with the company’s cement-making capa-
city, which was increased from 40,000
tons to 60,000 tons in 1948, and the
observer can appreciate the admirable
growth of this SA cement-producer,
one of two in the State.
In September last year the chairman
calmed shareholders’ doubts as to the
effect of the commissioning of several
large new plants in Victoria and NSW.
Although the record sales of 1962-63
(since exceeded in 1963-64) included
a fair proportion of interstate sales, he
said the steady growth in the usage of
cement in SA would absorb the com-
pany’s full output.
The May, 1964, announcement that
the company was planning a £2£ million
expansion programme shows that it is
not intimidated by large-scale entrants
to the industry in neighboring States.
More from Hecla?
Tlecla’s result for the year to April 30
was certainly a beauty. Profit rose
from £77,000 to £122,000 —best result
since listing in 1961. The increase was
equal to a lift of 56 p.c.
In addition, it was achieved after big
increases in the provisions for tax and
depreciation. Directors attributed the
improvement to increased sales and en-
couraged shareholders by pointing out
that the trend was continuing into the
current year.
Considering this, and seeing the earn-
ing rate received a considerable boost
from 14 p.c. to 22.2 p.c., one can’t help
but feel that the dividend lift from 8 p.c.
to 9 p.c. was rather paltry. It takes just
under £50,000 of the £122,000 profit.
Still, maybe this augurs well for another
increase in the current year.

Boral Leaps Ahead
a pattern of rising profits since 1959, Boral Ltd
has done it again with a near 50 p.c. leap to £2,457,300
—£803,696 higher than the previous year’s record of
£1,653,604.
The profit is more than sufficient to maintain the earning
rate in the wake of the large diversification and expansion
programme the company undertook during the year under
review. These operations substantially increased paid capital,
which now stands at £6,834,609 including £500,000 in prefer-
ence shares.
During the year, Boral acquired the road surfacing interests
of BHP By-Products Ltd, took over Mt Lyell Investments Ltd
and The Gas Supply Co. Ltd, obtained a majority shareholding
in Mt. Lyell Mining and Railway, and substantial shareholdings
in Ansett Transport Industries Ltd and Portfolio and Develop-
ment Ltd.
Since June 30 it has sold some of its holding in Mt Lyell
for £1.3 million cash to Consolidated Gold Fields (Aust.) Pty,
wholly-owned subsidiary of the London-based Consolidated
Gold Fields Ltd. It still retains 5,039,000 shares or 30.96 p.c.
of the issued capital.
This investment returned Boral £333,397 during the year to
June 30, but will not be included in its accounts again.
Profit remained after lifting depreciation from £1,139,314
to £1,652,795 and tax from £727,067 to £781,266. This tax
provision, directors point out, is less than would be normally
provided because:
• Mt Lyell’s taxation provision is reduced due to conces-
sions allowed mining companies.
• Some subsidiaries are not subject to tax, having incurred
losses.
• Income of dividends Boral receives is subject to income-
tax rebates.
9 There were “other deductions of a non-recurring nature”.
Reserves now total about £16.7 million (£9.6 million at the
corresponding time last year) and do not include the consoli-
dation of any reserves from Mt Lyell Mining. Dividend is
held steady at 20 p.c.
Doubtful Dairy Expansion
the value of Model Dairy’s big takeover moves in
1963-64 cannot be properly gauged until the 1964-65
results are at hand, accounts released last week must make
shareholders wonder if all that expansion was worthwhile.
Last September, the Melbourne-based company took over the
Sunbeam and Kinross dairy groups in a deal worth £1 million
on the market and involving £375,000 in ss. shares plus some
£23,000 cash.
Later, the Hatherleigh Dairy of Bentleigh and the F. C. Gir-
lings Dairy of Ormond were acquired for cash —but to raise
this may have involved share issuing too. Just a fortnight
ago, the Alexandra Dairy Co. was also acquired—a manu-
facturer of butter and milk powder in a country district of
growing importance.
All these acquisitions (except the last) had their results in-
cluded in the consolidated figure, which showed a big leap from
£104,000 to £151,000 over the year. Sunbeam and Kinross
were in for the full year, but not the other two. Despite this,
and despite directors’ statements last year that the moves would
improve earning capacity, the 1963-64 earning rate moved
only marginally from 13.4 to 13.6 p.c. on the higher capital.
Of course, saying such things at this stage may be a little
harsh. No doubt, the 1964-65 year will show a better per-
formance, after more time has allowed directors to get the
feel of the new set-up, extend integration and possibly effect
certain economies. In the longer run, the mere fact that the
group has vastly increased its number of outlets should make
for greater stability, security and protection against competi-
tors, if nothing else. If this outlook was the main motive
behind the expansionary moves, though, predictions of im-
proved earnings seem rather out of place. More accurate
would have been a statement on the need to preserve earnings.
National Bag Keeps Mum
four weeks of takeover talks with an unidentified pro-
spective bidder, National Bag directors still have nothing
to report—except that the discussions are continuing. This
was revealed in a one-sentence statement made to the Stock
Exchange soon after the company’s result for 1963-64 was
made public.
Profit jumped 27 p.c. from £157,000 to £200,000 and the
dividend will be held at 10 p.c. Earning rate was up from 20.9
p.c. to 25.8 p.c., thus leaving £122,000 for reserves after the
£78,000 dividend charge. With higher depreciation and tax
the result must be considered as excellent. Even without take-
over, future capital benefits may accrue to shareholders now
that reserves have been boosted even further in excess of paid
capital to around £1.3 million.
A pity the directors’ performance in reporting takeover pro-
ceedings fall so far short of the performance they get from
their company. Most shareholders are sceptical anyway.
Takeover chances for National Bag are nothing new —the
shares have jumped up and down consistently over the past
few years every time bids were rumored. They were, quite
frequently in fact.
Of course, many will be criticising the board’s attitude.
They want to know who the prospective bidder is, any likely
price, are negotiations satisfactory so far, etc., etc.? But the
board’s attitude is probably very wise. Obviously the takeover
chances are slim or such long-winded talks would not be
necessary. It is best to be tight-lipped under such circu/n-
-stances, especially regarding the bid-rumored past.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Still a Desirable Share
Felt and Textiles without South Africa
Tt would be fair to say that the
announcement of the sale of Felt
and Textiles of Australia Ltd’s 50.49 p.c.
interest in Felt and Textiles of South
Africa took the market by surprise. The
annual report, which most shareholders
would have received only a few days be-
fore the announcement, gave no hint of
the impending sale.
Press comment at the time drew at-
tention to the 20 p.c. discount that had
been accepted on the market price of the
South African company’s shares and
also to the fact that 17 p.c. would need
to be earned in the net proceeds to
replace the earnings given up. This
rather overstated the position because, as
Felt and Textiles of Australia’s directors
pointed out in their annual report, in
that particular year, the South African
group benefited to the extent of
£A187,000 because of a change in the
method of paying tax.
After making allowances for this, the
rate for the 1962-63 and the 1961-62
years was around 14 p.c. It must be
mentioned that in the preceding five
years this rate had been as low as 3.8
p.c. and was at its highest in 1956-57
(the year the company became a subsi-
diary of Felt and Textiles of Australia)
at 8.1 p.c. The dividend rate which had
been 121 p.c, until 1960-61 inclusive
was raised to 171 p.c. in 1961-62 and
to 181 p.c. (as the result of a l-for-2
bonus issue) in 1962-63. The gross
dividend yield given up was then 4.9 p.c.
or just under 4.6 p.c. after dividend
withholding tax. If the whole of the
£2.4 million is applied in reduction in
bank overdraft which, for the group,
stood at under £l.B million at June 30,
1963, the after-tax saving in terms of
yield would hardly be more than 3.9
p.c. even if the average overdraft rate
is as high as 61 p.c.
the funds will need to be
invested to better advantage in the
future. The acquisition of Ark Rubber
Industries for about £492,000 in cash
and 320,203 Felt and Textiles of Aus-
tralia’s shares will presumably add about
£50,000 to group earnings and £25,000
to the parent company’s dividends from
subsidiaries. This suggests that, unless
some dramatic increase occurs in earn-
ings and dividends, the investment will
not be equivalent to the South African
one. The issue of parent company
shares complicates the comparison, but
if the subsidiary had been acquired as
to 100 p.c. on the same basis as the
principal shareholders’ holdings were
acquired (12s. cash per share), the return
would have been 8.2 p.c. on earnings
and 4.2 p.c. on dividends.
Presumably Felt and Textiles of Aus-
tralia will now be able to repay the
£707,000 of 8 p.c. unsecured notes due
next March in cash. This will have the
effect of reducing the interest bill by
£56,560, which would be equivalent to
investing to produce 4.8 p.c. net.
Perhaps it is now opportune to exa-
mine the profit trends of the Australian
and New Zealand groups 'over the last
five years in terms of net profit before
tax.
(£A'000)
Year 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963
Australia 948 1289 527 656 887
New Zealand 540 594 706 838 775
Total 1488 1883 1233 1494 1662
These figures indicate that the im-
provement in profitability of the New
Zealand operation has been quite drama-
tic and continuous apart from the 1962-
63 year. In these circumstances, it
would seem natural to retain an invest-
ment which has been growing at the
rate of nearly 27 p.c. per annum com-
pound and dispose of the one with an
erratic record, such as the South African
group.
From the point of view of the share-
holders, they can only look at the
future on the basis of current known
facts plus a certain amount of guess-
work. The Australian group has exhi-
bited a cyclical pattern over the last five
years and it does not seem unreasonable
to regard 1962-63 as an “average” year.
The New Zealand group has shown a
good growth pattern which may have
reached a peak, but again the 1962-63
year is probably a conservative figure
to use. The Ark Rubber Industries
group seems to have had a bad year in
1960-61, otherwise earnings for the other
three years of the four-year period have
been about £50,000. While we will be
able to make a much better appraisal
next November, when the 1963-64
accounts are available, we could make a
very rough assessment of earnings for
1965-66 as follows:
£'ooo
Australian group 490
New Zealand group 160
Ark Rubber 50
Saving of note interest 34
Investment of balance of
South African funds at 6 p.c. (say) 60
*794
However, this appraisal overlooks the
idct that over £1.5 million was invested
in Australia and New Zealand in the
1962- year and presumably no benefit
would have been received from this
investment in that year. Generally, then,
it would not be difficult to see earnings
reach £900,000 by 1965-66 and this
would represent a return on the present
issued capital of about 13.3 p.c. While
this is not a dramatic earning rate, it
does mean that at 8s. 6d. the shares are
selling at just over 12i times earnings.
The 10 p.c. dividend rate seems well
covered even on capital increased last
year by a l-for-5 par issue and the cur-
rent price shows an immediate dividend
return of close to 6 p.c.
II/hile dividend growth has not been
" dramatic since 1952 (the year when
the company failed to pay a .dividend), it
has averaged 3 p.c. per annum over the
last five years and by any standards these
have not been easy years. Unfortunately
over this same period the per share
earnings attributable to the Australian
and New Zealand groups have actually
decreased, as have the earnings from
the whole group including the South
African group.
At this stage, all indications are that
Felt and Textiles’ shares are a desirable
holding in any diversified portfolio be-
cause of the relatively high dividend and
earnings yields. The earlier calculation
made no allowance for improved pro-
fitability over the 1962-63 level and it
is a fact that in the first half of the
1963- year profits were running 7\
p.c. above the corresponding period of
the 1962-63 year. It could be that,
despite the sale of the South African
interests, the market is underestimating
the group’s potential to grow in much
the same way as it tends to misunder-
stand the nature of its many businesses.

NZ Forest Products plans ahead
NZ Forest Products Ltd is at pre-

bout of expansion which will cost £NZ6
million. Over the next few years, sub-
stantial capital expenditure will be pro-
gressively required to establish the mills
and ancillary activities needed for utili-
sing extra supplies of log timber. These
supplies will increase every year until
about 1980. Then, “full forest utilisa-
tion” will be achieved and the present
crop will be doubled, if directors’ plans
work out.
As the daily Press has reported, part
of the £NZ6 million will be raised by
a one-for-eight issue to shareholders.
What most papers have overlooked is
the fact that the issue will be made after
the 20s.(NZ) shares have been split to
10s.(NZ) par. So, in actual fact, on
their present holdings, shareholders will
be receiving the benefits of a one-for-four
issue, not a one-for-eight. This fact has
not been stressed in the majority of
Press reports.
The benefits will not be small. A
7s. 6d.(NZ) premium will be tacked
on to the par value of the new scrip—
Australian shareholders will pay about
21s. 10id. in all for each new share.
At present the units are selling between
60s. and 625. on Australian stock ex-
changes. After the split and issue they
should be going for 30s. to 315., so
capital gains will be in the vicinity of
9s. a share.
Of course the figure may not be quite
as high as this, as the price will no
longer be “cum issue”. However, there
will be no worries of reduced dividends
or any similar problem, which often face
shareholders after an issue. In their
annual report for the year to March 31,
the directors are confident that the “cur-
rent ordinary dividend rate of 8 p.c. will
continue and that it should be regarded
as the minimum rate in the immediate
future”.
This “minimum rate” statement will
help support the scrip after the split and
issue. Moreover, the fact that it was
selling at around 60s. a week before any
news of an issue was known supports
the argument for believing that the
new price will .be somewhere around 30s.
And this 60s. was not inflated by any
leakage of the directors’ plans. In fact,
Ihe shares slipped to 595. 6d. during the
stock exchange week (May 11-15) be-
fore the combined split, issue and record
profit announcement was made.
The 1963-64 results, and any indica-
tlon they give of future performance,
cannot be discussed with any accuracy
until exactly what the company does is
made clear. As it is not a local concern,
and as the company’s name gives only a
general idea of its activities, many Aus-
tralian investors are somewhat in the
dark as to its role in New Zealand.
Its most important asset, and the main
source of raw material for its present
and future manufacturing activities, is
250,000 acres of North Island forest.
This increases in volume and value every
year (as long as fire takes no toll). The
original plantings were made between
1924 and 1936. Forests established be-
tween then and now will eventually prove
to be more valuable than the originals,
thanks to today’s improved tending oper-
ations which result in a superior product.
Tn brief, timber from these forests is
used by the company to produce in-
sulating and hard wallboards, sawn tim-
ber, veneer, vegetable turpentine, cases
and boxes, multi-wall bags, pulp, paper
and fibre containers. These items are
manufactured at Kinleith, Penrose, and
Whakatane (where the main subsidiary,
a board mill company, was acquired in
1961-62). Since December, 1962, an
association has existed with APM
through a joint company, Fibre Products
New Zealand, which makes soft
moulded pulp products.
The share issue proposed by the com-
pany (it is still subject to shareholders’
approval at the annual meeting in Auck-
land on September 25) is the largest in
NZ financial history. The nature of the
industry means that the expansion result-
ing from this issue will not, in the short
run, result in a complete sellout of the
increased production each year. How-
ever, directors intend to help overcome
this problem by chasing an export mar-
ket.
In 1963-64, £l4l million was earned
from exports. As a total turnover figure
is not available, the importance of this
sum is not able to be evaluated. But
whatever the situation, any importance
existing now will certainly grow. A
representative looked after the com-
pany’s interests on a Government-
sponsored trade mission to North Ame-
rica in 1963-64. A director visited
Japan, Hong Kong, Korea and other
Eastern countries. At present, Australia
and the Pacific Islands are still the main
export customers, but new fields are
rapidly being opened.
An effort is constantly being made
to keep manufacturing techniques up to
date and to introduce new products
where warranted. To these ends, close
touch is kept with overseas developments
in the pulp, paper and allied industries,
mainly by sending senior personnel to
visit the various mills.
The 1964-65 year should see benefits
from a new chlorine dioxide plant and
extensions to the chlorine plant at Kin-
leith which are now producing. Ade-
quate supplies of fully bleached pulp
(used in the manufacture of printing
and writing paper), as well as limited
quantities of bleached pulp for export,
are now available.
There are several major new develop-
ments which will help absorb the £NZ6
million. One of the cardboard machines
at Whakatane should be finished by the
end of this year adding to output capa-
city. A new paper machine at Kinleith
will be ready by June, 1965. Another
will have expanded production by Sep-
tember that year.
From the foregoing, it is pretty easy
to see the main reason for the company’s
success—forward planning. Strict sche-
dules and plans are drawn up, then
adhered to. Without this, most com-
panies get into trouble or earn less than
they could. There are very few who
plan as far ahead as 1980, but NZ Forest
Products is one of them. Future suc-
cess will also be ensured by the high
degree of vertical integration—reliance
on no one but the customer. The com-
pany produces its own main raw material
and manufactures most of the products
which are distributed through its own
selling departments.
The 1963-64 year was another of
growth and improved profitability.
Working capital is still healthy, fixed
assets are still growing and reserves have
come back slightly following the 1963
one-for-eight bonus issue. In addition
to this benefit, shareholders have seen
their scrip climb to new heights over the
year and they are now in line for yet
another issue.
What of the future? The short term
looks fair enough but, in the long run,

shareholders could score considerable
gains. Between now and when “full
forest utilisation” is achieved (early
1980 s), further finance will be necessary
for progressive expansion. Shareholders
should therefore see further capital
gains. Directors have had long-term
forecasts prepared and are satisfied that
expansion will continue on a profitable
basis.
Of course, the biggest danger is going
to be the fire threat, but insurance and
an intricate protection set-up are doing
all that is humanly possible to prevent
trouble. The latest NZ summer was
long and dry, yet the forests are still in
peak condition. Not one outbreak
occurred in the Kinleith area and two at
Matahina were controlled with no
material damage or loss.
The future is generally excellent. The
1963-64 record profit was another step
towards full utilisation of the forests,
which will produce abundant rewards for
those who are prepared to wait. In the
shorter term, the scrip can currently be
bought to yield just more than 3 p.c.
Not very big, though it will rise if the
share issue is taken up. This, the
moderate capital gains which a briefer
holding could yield, and the wider mar-
ket created for the scrip by the split, all
add up to a solid investment with fair
returns in the shorter term.
BENNETT AND FISHER LTD
An Excellent Holding
T ivestock salesman, wool and produce
broker Bennett and Fisher Ltd en-
joyed a bumper year to June 30, 1964.
Profit rose to the unprecedented height
of £246,060, after providing £157,311
for tax (this will have to be adjusted
upwards, thanks to the Budget measure)
and £40,839 for depreciation.
Previous best was £205,514 in 1955-
56. The 1963 result was a mere
£176,656.
Shareholders are constantly reminded
that earnings are affected by seasonal
conditions and wool prices also, as much
as by general increases in tax and opera-
ting expenses.
The “provision for doubtful debts and
seasonal and stock fluctuations”, which
stood amongst reserves in the group
balance sheet at £226,546, has been
renamed simply “provisions for seasonal
fluctuations”.
From provisions made out of profits
of previous years, directors in 1963
transferred £lOO,OOO to general reserve
(bringing it to £1,000,000), £63,000 to
provision for long service leave and staff
superannuation, £13,420 was paid to the
trustees of the staff superannuation fund,
and £188,570 was provided for doubtful
debts and seasonal and stock fluctua-
tions.
The chairman (Sir Arthur Rymill) in
1963 told shareholders that the balances
in the profit and loss appropriation
account which then totalled £159,588
(1964, £206,121) would be considered
available for dividend equalisation pur-
poses if necessary, and if in the interests
of shareholders.
Investors can take it from that that the
15 p.c. dividend, now held for eight
years, will be maintained even if it means
drawing on reserves, if the company
should have one or two lean years.
Mention was also made in the 1963
chairman’s address that sales of super-
phosphate had increased to the greatest
tonnage ever handled by the company.
Bennett and Fisher Ltd was estab-
lished in Adelaide in 1919 after the
merger of the stock and station agency
and auctioneering business of that name
and the wool brokerage and agency
business carried on by Cheadle Crase
and Co.
Profits have been continuous since
at least 1926, although lean years in the
depression prevented ordinary dividend
payments for seven years in the ’3os.
As capital benefits have been extended
to shareholders since the issue of 74 p.c.
notes in the ratio of one-for-two shares
held in May, 1960, these converted to
ordinary shares on June 30, 1963, taking
paid ordinary capital to £900,000.
Prior to that there was a one-for-one
share issue at par in July, 1956.
The 39 p.c. lift in 1964 profit enabled
Bennett and Fisher to handle the capital
increase (by virtue of the notes conver-
sion) very well. Earning rate eased only
slightly from 25.7 p.c. to 24.8 p.c.
The 20s. shares now sell for around
645. to yield 4.7 p.c., which is a solid
return from an excellent company. So
long as seasons are favorable, and wool
prices reasonably firm, this stock should
remain excellent holding.
FUNCTIONAL HOLDINGS LTD
Too Much Diversification
'C'unctional Holdings Ltd achieved
A listing on Sydney Stock Exchange in
August, 1962, after the bubble had burst
for land developers.
The ss. shares opened then at Is. pre-
mium. With publicity attendant on a
one-for-four par issue in July, 1963, the
shares did reach as high as 9s. 6d.
Prospectus estimates were for a divi-
dend of not less than 10 p.c. Profits
for the year to March 31, 1963, of
£19,340 (18.6 p.c. on capital) allowed
a dividend payment of 124 p.c.
The latest term (to March, 1964) pro-
vided some setbacks for the company.
Profit fell to £9606, or 7.4 p.c. on capi-
tal. The final dividend was therefore
omitted, so total payment for the year

was 64 p.c., which discouraged investors
to the extent of putting the shares down
to their present level of 2s. sd.
The 1964 result was after £6525 tax,
£5239 depreciation, and after writing off
£2817 capitalisation of profits in instal-
ments receivable and £326 share
brokerage.
The 1963 result was after £18,899
tax, £2,996 depreciation, and after
writing off £9390 capitalisation of profits
in instalments receivable.
Activities of the group were, at the
time of listing, manufacture of a limited
number of furniture lines by Functional
Products Pty, holding of land at Terrigal
for future development by LMP Deve-
lopment Pty, and holding of substantial
mortgages on real estate in Queensland
by Gold Coast Estates Pty.
LMP had decided in 1961 to diversify
into establishment of drive-in restaurants
in the Sydney, Newcastle and Wollon-
gong areas, with plans for extension
interstate. In 1962-63 Gold Coast
Estates Pty became Drive-In Restaurants
(Qld) Pty and LMP became Drive-In
Restaurants (NSW) Pty.
The first drive-in restaurant was
opened in Granville during 1962-63.
Directors reported in July, 1964, that
its full potential had not yet been
reached.
Repayments under mortgage on the
Broadbeach land were reduced from
£16,666 with a profit content of £15,233
in 1963 to £5OOO with a profit content
of £4570 in 1964. The original pur-
chaser failed to meet his obligations and
the land was resold to another company.
The repayment period was extended.
Drive-In Restaurants (Qld) Pty took an
equity interest in the purchase company,
which is developing the land, so as to
share in profits arising from the develop-
ment.
An unsuccessful sortie was made into
the operation of vending trucks in
Queensland during the year under re-
view, from which Functional has with-
drawn after making a loss.
Transfer of the furniture factory to
new premises affected profits of this
section of the business, but benefits are
expected later.
Directors admitted that the company
was passing through a period of tight
liquidity (note the deficit working capital
at both balance dates) and hopes to sell
surplus freeholds during 1964-65 to pay
out the high interest contracts on the
mobile vending fleet.
When this has been completed, direc-
tors expect profits to recover and that
satisfactory returns will be available to
shareholders. They themselves have
voluntarily taken a 50 p.c. reduction in
fees.
To make a cash issue to shareholders
and then chop the dividend is the best
way to discourage investors.
Pursuit of business in the furniture
field, and concentration on disposing of
existing property, rather than further
extension of resources and diversifica-
tion of interests, would possibly not pro-
duce exciting profit results, but it would
diminish the risk element, and present
an image of some solidity.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Getting in on a Big Fight
PThe RMC battle has had the same
■*- excitement as a big fight some
sparring in the early rounds and then a
few fierce uppercuts by the defender. A
foul was scored by each fighter in the
middle rounds, followed by much con-
sultation with the seconds. Now, as we
get near the final round, the weight of
CSR-BMI is giving it the edge.
CSR-BMI now says acceptances ex-
ceeding 50 p.c. have been received. This
implies that the majority of institutions
holding RMC have accepted the offer.
On the other hand, the average individual
has been so confused by the delaying
tactics of RMC that he’s momentarily
thrown in the towel. At last, with some-
thing more definite to go upon, an accep-
tance from such a shareholder seems
much more likely.
Let’s look at the defenders and their
background in more detail. Both CSR
and BMI have had a very much better
record in recent years than has RMC.
Yet the present board of RMC continues
to stand aloof from the humble share-
holder and his requirements. There was
the debacle in 1962, when shareholders
suddenly found that, instead of being in
a “growth” company, they were in a
company in which profits barely covered
the dividend.
Although the UK subsidiary has just
announced a one-for-one bonus issue, its
sale early this year was probably a
prudent move by the parent Australian
company. It presumably gave directors
an opportunity to reduce the capital to
a more sensible level. They had other
ideas, though, for they planned to
promote an underwriting company. How-
ever, shareholder opinion was so strong
that directors were reluctantly forced to
abandon the idea.
Now directors see themselves losing
their empire altogether. Desperate as
their moves have been so far in this take-
over contest, they’ll probably become
more desperate as time goes on.
Once again my advice is to accept the
offer. In fact I’m buying 100 just for
that reason. Not that I’ll get any CSR
or BMI shares. Instead, I will receive all
cash at about the rate of 17s. a share,
just a net 2s. above the purchase price
of 14s. Bd.
Of course, the success of this trans-
action depends upon whether the offer
goes through. On the other hand, the
success of my next purchase, James
Wallace, depends upon that company’s
result for the year just finished.
It has just not been the building con-
tractors’ year. Even Lend Lease has
lost its support at 10s. and is now
lurching heavily around 9s. It seemed to
be carrying things too far when the share
price of James Wallace suddenly col-
lapsed from ss. to 3s. Perhaps I would
think differently if the company had not
earned at least 20 p.c. every year since
1958.
The interim dividend was cut from 6
p.c. to 3 p.c., but directors stated that
the normal final dividend of 6 p.c. was
expected to be paid. Directors even gave
the earning rate of 13.6 p.c. for that
half-year and stated that these profits
did not have the benefit of any major
construction projects.
Nothing appears to have changed the
situation. So, therefore, why this radical
fall in price to almost half par? By the
time I’d sorted out this reasoning, the
shares were back up to 4s. Id.
Another week where the purchases
have been on a very moderate scale.
One of the sales gets the record for being
in the portfolio for the shortest number
of days. I’d not figured that Kolotex
would be out making another cash bid.
This sort of thing frightens me —so
much so that I decided to sell and
promptly showed a £l6 loss. James
Hardie was the other sale this week.
They just could not get past the £7
mark. Slightly offsetting the earlier loss
was a profit of £2.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD
600 Kolotex, 14/- £412
200 James Hardie, 140/- £1382
BOUGHT
100 RMC, 14/8 £75
500 James Wallace, 4/1 £lOB
The credit in the account now swings
up to £1626.
There’s been a few setbacks in the
portfolio among the mining stocks, but
the industrial stocks held up well.
William Adams stood out after the split
into 10s. units. Two other recent pur-
chases, A. G. Sims and ODE, have not
been disgraced, either.
The portfolio now is:

THE MAN
ON THE LAND
Bradford Invents “Wool Monolith”
The reserve price scheme as prudent selling
A monolith, according to the diction-
ary, is a large block of stone or
a statue carved from it.
From this one might gather that the
term “The Wool Monolith” refers, per-
haps, to a statue of Sir William Gunn.
Not so.
The “Monolith” is how the Bradford
(UK) “Wool Record”, an influential
trade journal, describes the world plan
for wool of which the Australian Wool
Board's reserve price marketing pro-
posal is a part.
Wool Board and International Wool
Secretariat public relations types will be
green with envy. After all, they are
paid big money to come up with gim-
micks like this.
Their best effort to date is “Wool-
mark”, the name for the trademark
which is designed to give wool a “quality
image” throughout the world. This is a
pretty tame effort compared with “Wool
Monolith”.
Nevertheless it remains a gimmick,
because it means pretty much the same
as “Wool Monopoly”. At any rate, the
difference is purely academic.
Yet since monopoly is a dirty word
these day, we can expect to hear a good
deal about the monolith from now on.
As “Wool Record’’ describes it: “Such
a monolith would have none of the shape
of an international cartel. All it would
do would be to make sure that wool was
not thrown away during a temporary
decline in prices in excess of the declines
caused by normal fluctuations in the
market.”
The paper goes on: “A favorable atti-
tude towards the proposed Australian
floor price scheme is being shown by
the great majority of Bradford wool men.
This may surprise some woolgrowers—
who have long nourished a totally erro-
neous impression of the average wool
user as a strange, rapacious beast who
wants no woolgrower to be able to draw
more than just enough breath to keep
him alive.
“What may have been overlooked —•
or insufficiently appreciated—is that
Bradford wool men are the most prag-
matic of men, ready at once to adapt
themselves to a situation which seems
fair and reasonable and likely to pro-
mote rather than stultify trade. An
Australian floor price scheme certainly
comes well within this description and
its establishment would mean that some-
thing near to a woolgrowing monolith
would be created.
“It would in no sense be a rigging of
the wool market, but a means of en-
suring that all wool was as prudently
sold as it would be if it were all owned
by a man not immediately pressed for
money.”
This is getting close to the heart of
the matter.
Those woolgrowers who are not
pressed for money—the 15,000 to 20,000
who produce half the Australian clip—•
would be as well off personally with or
without a floor price scheme. But the
great majority of small growers—some
80,000 to 90,000 are rarely in this
happy position. It is these men who have
found private selling an increasingly
attractive proposition in recent years.
Private selling is no good for the
industry as a whole.
The United States is a good example
of what private selling can do to wool-
growing. One does not hear much about
the American woolgrower these days,
because he is almost extinct. If he exists
at all it is as a Navajo herdsman, or as
a part-time nomad in the mountain
leasehold areas.
Had the United States had a flourish-
ing auction system, then the American
woolgrowing business might today be an
important primary industry.
In recent years in Australia, private
selling has been very much on the in-
crease. Its sole advantage is that it gives
the woolgrower cash on the property.
He knows he is taking less than he
would if he waited and sent it through
the auction room—but he needs the
money.
In 1963-64, private selling made a
spectacular leap in Western Australia.
About 30 p.c. of the WA clip was esti-
mated to have been sold to private
buyers. The overall Australian figure was
estimated at somewhere between 6 and
8 p.c. of the total.
It is no news to anyone that a private
woolbuyer is in business for himself.
His aim is to get wool at prices below
those ruling on the auction floors.
Naturally he incurs some expenses and
he takes these into account when he
decides on the price he will offer the
woolgrower.
Should the reserve price plan happen
to be rejected, then we might expect to
see a rapid increase in private selling, for
the reason that a lot of woolgrowers
want money quickly and have a well-
founded fear of the “potholes” in prices
which the big man can ride over.
The danger to the whole industry
(including the big men) should be fairly
obvious. If a manufacturer abroad can
get a relatively low quote from a private
buyer, he is likely to limit his bidding on
the auction floor.
Only some manufacturers at present
get supplies from the private buyers,
while private selling remains at current
levels. It is an unreliable method of
obtaining supplies. Most manufacturers,
along with most woolgrowers, would
prefer a price stability comparable with
the stability of synthetic fibres.
The Wool Board's marketing proposal
would provide this stability, or, at any
rate, that is what its advocates claim for
it. v
Should the “Wool Monolith” emerge,
and it probably will, one important mat-
ter which may get immediate attention
is the United States market. As well as
attempting to get more favorable access


CAULFIELD GRAMMAR SCHOOL
A Summer School for boys and girls at present completing Inter-
mediate and Leaving will be held at the School for the fortnight
beginning 16th January next. Its aim is to order subject detail and
widen the background and reading of boys and girls who propose to take
honors courses at the university.

to this market, both for raw wool and
woollen textiles, a revival of the home
woolgrowing industry might well be con-
sidered.
Wool seems to be in the happy posi-
tion that what is good for the product is
good for all associated with it —growers,
manufacturers and marketers. It still
has only 9 p.c. of the total apparel fibre
market of the world and the scope there-
fore is virtually unlimited.
Recent thoughts that the Vietnam
crisis may provide another Korea —in
terms of wool sales to the US —appear
to be based on wishful thinking rather
than hard fact. Throughout World
War II and the Korean War the US
Armed Forces used more wool than any
fighting force in the history of warfare.
The US Quartermaster’s slogan was said
to be: “All wool and a yard wide.”
Since Korea it may be said to be:
“All Dupont with a yard of zipper.”
Australians who remember the sham-
bling, gum-chewing Yanks of World
War 11, in their drab olive uniforms,
usually get a shock when they see the
present-day equivalents in such places
as Germany, Hawaii or the States them-
selves. These days it is all shiny boots,
creased pants, endless saluting, and spit
and polish.
The uniforms are a dazzling and con-
fusing result of military imagination.
They run through conventional khaki to
bottle-green and various shades of blue.
Different regiments wear brilliant neck
scarves of red, blue and yellow, and
other flamboyant appurtenances. There’s
more brass than the British Army ever
had, even at the peak of Victorian mili-
tary splendor.
What has happened, of course, is that
the American Army—and the Air Force
and Navy and the forces within the
forces such as the Army Air Corps—
have merely borrowed ideas from their
former enemies and allies. It’s been
going on since the Roman Army bor-
rowed ideas from Hannibal.
The point here is that today the uni-
forms are 90 p.c. synthetics and are
likely to remain so.
The Korean War really laid the foun-
dations of the vast US synthetics fibre
monopolies and cartels. (No monolith
about them.)
If anyone increases production greatly
as a result of the present war scare, it is
more likely to be synthetics than wool.
That does not mean that there may
not be some increased wool buying by
US textile interests. But hopes of
another lift in wool prices to the 1950-
51 heights are largely based on the idea
that history repeats itself. It does,
though only sometimes and never
entirely.
Respectability for Beef?
A new image on the British market
Having got, so to speak, its hoof in
Europe’s door, the Australian beef
industry is embarking on what may be
the most critical test in its history.
In the first half of this year, Australia
sold 30,700 tons of beef to Britain —
four times as much as in the same period
the year before. The opening was created
by two factors: a European shortage
caused by the failure of local and South
American supplies, and aggravated by
lapses in the pig industry, and an agree-
ment to limit Australian beef exports to
the United States following protests by
American producers at the volume of
their country’s beef imports which in
1962 accounted for 25 per cent of all
meat moving in world trade,
The timing of the European shortage
in relation to the American squeeze spelt
salvation for Australia’s beef. To keep
the flow of exports going was simply a
matter of diverting shipments from one
side of the Atlantic to the other and being
more circumspect about quality than
Australia has always bothered to be with
Mother Britain in the past,
No subject has been fraught with more
doubt and confusion than the European
meat shortage. The question of when
stability is likely to be restored in full is
one that defies even so sane and realistic
a source as the Australian Meat Board.
Asked it before his recent departure for
Australia, the board’s London representa-
tive, Mr D. B. Muirhead, said: “That is
the 64,000-dollar question. It could be
years”. Everyone knows massive in-
creases in numbers cannot be achieved
in beef cattle as fast as in white mice.
A t least the beginnings of a trend, how-
have been signalled in the last
fortnight. Half-way through August,
Smithfield market experienced the largest
fall in beef prices for the year, Argen-
tine hindquarters dropping 6d. to 9d. a
lb. The president of the British Import-
ed Meat Trade Association, Mr J. Cur-
ley, said beef imports from the Argen-
tine and Commonwealth countries were
expected to increase steadily over the
next six months.
How will Australian beef, ushered on
to the market by an emergency, fare
when things return to normal?
Once, had the question been asked in
Britain, the answers would not have been
flattering. In the history of its relations
with the British market, the Australian
beef industry has much to answer for
from the canned watery gristle with
which elements of the Australian industry
rallied to the aid of the Old Country
during World War II to the overfat car-
casses and broken contracts that have
more recently prompted forecasts of ex-
tinction for Australian beef on this mar-
ket.
No one expects Britain to be as nice
about Australia’s beef industry as the
London “Daily Telegraph” reporter who,
born, apparently, since the days of the
watery gristle, wrote recently about the
20,000 tons of meat that would reach
the British market in the next six weeks
as a result of “a tremendous effort by
Australia to offset Britain’s beef short-
age”.
It is sufficient that British importers,
who, two years ago, were reviling Austra-
lian beef, are now acknowledging that the
industry is making a tremendous effort
to solve its own problems. Mr Norman
Poultney, managing director of Henry S.
Fitter and Sons, one of Britain’s biggest
independent buyers of Australian meat,
says the quality of Australian beef has
improved markedly since new grading
standards, such as he had been advoca-
ting for years, were introduced in May
last year by the Australian Meat Board
in conjunction with the Department of
Primary Industry. Under these standards,
supplies to the UK market must meet
definite specifications for cut, trim and
fat cover. Mr Poultney thinks the whole
trade has come to think more kindly of
Australian beef and that the quality
standards came just in time to save Aust-


ralian beef from fumbling the chance
the European shortage gave it.
An executive of another large British
meat complex with operations in Aust-
ralia agrees that quality has much im-
proved, but that range cattle such as
Australia produces cannot be changed
overnight. Most of the improvement, he
maintains, concerns presentation, packing
and adherence to the new standards of
cut and trim factors that involve the
exporter rather than the producer.
The question becomes one of whether
these immediate reforms are enough to
assure Australian beef of its present hold
on the British market after the conditions
that now favor it have receded and before
the results of long-term research in
breeding and feeding put firmer ground
under the industry’s feet.
Contributing towards a favorable an-
swer for Australia are the traditional de-
ceptions of the British meat trade. An
importer who did not want his name
quoted said last week that he had no
doubt at all that any Australian beef
entering retail shops in this country was
ever presented to the housewife as any-
thing but Scottish or English beef. What
invites thought here is not so much the
morals of the butchers, as the capacity
of Australian beef, once dismissed by
the average shopper as a spongy mass
of tissue and blood, to carry off the mas-
querade.
It may not be necessary for a large
proportion of Australian beef to excel
in the shops, for the British public, in
numbers that startle the statisticians, are
dining out as never before. If there are
any traces of meat’s origin that survive
the butcher’s knife, it is certain they will
not get past the cook’s pot.
Many in the trade feel that the future
for Australian beef in the UK lies in
riding on the expansion of its traditional
outlets: catering and contracting.
Acceptance of Australian beef will not
alone assure its future. Price must go
with it. Unfortunate as it may be for the
consumer, it is not likely that values will
ever again return to the levels of the
recent past. It has been estimated that the
European shortage may take four or
five years to overcome. This would be
time enough for the exceptional price to
become the rule.
Moreover, there is more interaction
than before between the meat trades of
Britain and the Common Market coun-
tries. It is inevitable that something of
the high-priced food policies of the Con-
tinent will rub off on Britain’s heavily
subsidised free market.
Establishment of a profitable market
for Australian beef in Britain could en-
able Australia to do something that has
been technically, but not economically,
feasible for a long time replace some
of its frozen beef exports with the much
more desirable chilled product. Two ship-
ments of chilled beef were sent here this
year by way of trial and were received
with enthusiasm, but the cost was too
great to be borne by the traditional re-
wards of the market.
Things may be changing, however. If
Australia could add the further refine-
ment of chilling to the improvements
she has already accomplished, her beef
would be well on the way to respecta-
bility.
Flail Mowers More Popular
Better cutting of hay and silage
Tf you can come up with a really good
idea for farm machinery the
chances are it will take off like a rocket.
Farmers may be staid in some respects.
When it comes to machinery they know
what they want and what they like.
The idea must, above all else, be
practical. That means it must pay. The
non-practical man on the land may be
a good fellow, but he is not really a
farmer.
The flail mower, or slasher, has now
left the launching pad and within a year,
or two at the outside, will be in full
orbit.
There have been various forms of
flails and slashers on the market for
some time. What we refer to here is the
flail suitable for cutting hay and silage.
Most of the manufacturers of farming
machinery have versions coming out
which will cut hay and silage.
The flail works like a rotary lawn-
mower. The conventional mower is
like a pair of hand-operated hair-clippers
mounted on wheels or attached to a
tractor.
The advantages of the flail type are
many. A flail needs little or no main-
tenance, merely a greasing before use
around the couplings. The conventional
mower, on the other hand, has always
been a problem.
Even the best mowers require a care-
ful going-over before use; the knives
need to be constantly kept sharp (usually
a second set of knives is standard pro-
cedure); the whole thing can be easily
thrown out of plumb; and there is a
whole range of pulleys, joins and locks
which need attention.
This writer has painful memories of
going contracting with a reconditioned
mower. What looked to be an inviting
paddock of tall, waving grass ready for
cutting turned out to be a paddock
which had been heavily stocked with
cattle during the winter. The pugging
beneath the grass was so bad that after
a couple of runs with the mower the
severe jolting loosened every nut and
bolt and eventually the contraption
simply quit functioning.
Certainly conventional mowers have
been improved. But the flail types have
overcome the one real obstacle that has
been holding them back—namely, their
inability to leave the cut grass in neat
swathes for picking up and baling.
This has now been overcome, and very
simply too. The grass rebounds from a
plate attached to the implement and
is laid out neatly in rows. Moreover,
the same implement can, by removal of
this plate, be used for scrub slashing or
pasture topping.
Only one drawback, as this writer
sees it, remains. You need a decent-
sized tractor, 30 horse-power upwards,
to get the best from a flail slasher. Most
tractors these days are in this category
and probably lighter materials will be
used in the making of flails.
Strictly speaking, the forage harvester,
used for silage, is a flail-type implement.
In this particular case the flails work on
a vertical plane, something like the reels
of the lawnmowers used on bowling
greens.
The forage harvester seems unlikely to
be threatened by the advances in rotary
flail slashers.
Each has the advantage over the con-
ventional mower of one-man operation.
(With a conventional mower it is nearly
always necessary to have a partner
sharpening the spare set of blades and
changing them over frequently.)
The forage harvester, like the flail
slasher, can do a turn at cleaning up
tussocks and so on, and is therefore an
implement which can be used all the year
round on the farm.
It would be interesting to get some
exact figures on this changeover from
conventional mowers to flails. In Bri-
tain now, about 90 p.c. of all silage
is cut by flails and 50 p.c. of all hay.
New implements which speed the pro-
cess, and improve the quality, are
coming out, to be used in conjunction
with flails. They include simple crim-
pers, turners, tedders and balers.
Some farmers hold that both slashers
and forage harvesters do not cut close
enough to the ground, and, therefore, are
not as economical as a conventional
mower. This is true, though it is less
so now than it was last year or the year
before.
The flails are getting better all the
time. One has only to think back to
the early rotary lawnmowers, and to
compare them with the jobs you can
buy now, to see which way the grass is
going to tumble.
