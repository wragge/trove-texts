The Mouth is the Gateway for the
Entrance of Disease.
Scientists have proved conclusively that no fewer
than 38 different infections may be traced with more
or less directness to the human mouth as a focal or
starting point, the mouth being the gateway for
the entrance of disease; therefore it is here that the
fight must begin to keep the enemy out.

The Red Page
The Australian Sweet-Pea Annual, 1918 (Angus
and Robertson, Sydney, 2s. 6d.), the first cultural
guide for the grower representative of all the States,
is ably edited by Alfred J. Quarrell, of S.A. This
is the first issue of an annual to appear at the end
of each year. It is fully illustrated and contains
articles from the lea dins' errowers in each State.
Condensed History
The school liistory-book. which is an un-
satisfactory tome at all times, will be a
bulgy, sketchy affair when the war debris
is cleared up. Space will have to be found
for so much new history that old history
must be cut out. Or else the infant will
have to be overcrowded, and even now there
is little spare space in even the bollowest
infant. Or else labor-saving devices must
be resorted to.
A sensible alphabet would do more to pro-
long the working life of man than a reduced
death-rate or an increased birth-rate. The
Old concern which, in its early form, the
Philistines invented, or the Phoenicians,
and which Cadmus sent to Greece—-or else
Greece look it to Cadmus —and which has
been patched ever since, and titled on by
violence to languages that were too large for
it, after the manner of a dwarf's. belltopper
on the head of a giant, is the great waster
of tilin' and energy. It costs more than the
royal family, the Trust, the grabbing land-
owner. the capitalist and the burglar all
combined. Hardly one word in the English
language spoils according to the sound of the
letters. Almost every word spells contrary
to the sound of the letters. Every word has
to be learned separately. Pronunciation was
given us to conceal the spelling, or the other
way about. Even such a simple word ns
“cow" hasn't a single letter which lias any
relation to the noise that expresses the ani-
mal. Any royal commission of dairy experts
that Hughes could appoint would agree
with this proposition. The hearing of this
on the school history book will appear.
' Yet the English language has an alphabet
which contains a letter for every sound, and
where it is used a child who has mastered
the alphabet can pronounce every word on
§ight. It was devised in order to make, the
newspaper possible. If the daily-paper man
had to rely on the old hogged hullock-dray of
an alphabet there would be no newspapers.
Supposing the phonetic alphabet to be used
for everyday purposes, a good two years
would be cut off the time necessary for even
a very ordinary education. With half the
saved time devoted to training for defence
purposes, and a quarter to science, and a
quarter to history, there would be a better
army and navy, a vastly improved system of
industry, and the average child would have
some real knowledge of the world’s political
and social record to guide him in after life,
instead of a swollen kid. bursting with un-
digested Saxon kings.
The present-day school* history is con-
densed to let the scholar have leisure to
learn when “pit” sounds “f,” and when “c”
is really “s” and when it is “k.” Therefore
it is an inaccurate dreary thing, with the
picturesque truth sacrificed- to considerations
of space. It is the only history that most
people read, and, even apart from the, lies
and omissions that are made in the interests
of so-called “patriotism,” it is p'ure melo-
drama. It draws a sharp line everywhere,
as the melodramatist does between the hero
and the villain. There are no lights and
shades and no perspective. A thousand
years hence that kind of history would make
Captain Cook and W. M. Hughes land in
Australia together, with the Federal Con-
stitution in their carpet-bag, during the brief
interval between the Trojan war and the
present linn disturbance, their expedition
being financed by Phoenicians who had come
to England in an aeroplane in search of tin.
The Romans leave Britain in one act, as
a Dago bagman with his luggage in his hand
might run for a train. The long twilight of
the Imperial power; the ambitious attempts
of the Roman-P.ritons to found a new empire
of their own : their failure through biting off
more than they could chew; the glimpse of
belated Romans still leading the defence
against the German invaders many years
later —all these don’t appear. There is no
room to mention that the “Saxons ' dida t
arrive with a bang like a cannon going oil;
that even before the Romans (who might be
called No. 2) had quite established them-
selves in the island and. put down the re-
sistance of the previous inhabitants (No. 1).
they appointed a heavily-armed officer, the
Count of the Saxon Shore, to stave off the
invaders (No. 3) who were already trying
to butt in.
The English conquest of Ireland passes
like a dog running for its life. / There
wouldn’t be time for the spelling lesson if it
was explained that the first noisy raid wasn t
a conquest; that it Was run by the Angevin
Empire (not clearly specified for lack of
ro'om), with the English humping the bag-
gage in the rear; and that the English, as
an independent people, only took up the
work afterwards and made a very long and
poor job of it. The two English semi-con-
quests of Frauce show the invaders entering
with great glory—the battle of Crecy, Poic-
tiers and A gin court are clearly specified—
and fading out unaccountably with no battles
or details save the burning of Joan of Arc,
as if they had merely gone away for a drink.
The Reformation and Freetrade arrive as
definitely as if they had opened the door with
a latch-key and come in, after the approved
fashion of Genesis where the universe and
man and woman and all the animals and
vegetables and minerals and sm
enter almost simultaneously, so that Crea-
tion only beats original sin by a head in a
half-mile sprint.
The Genesis man was the ideal school
history-writer. He said briefly that the
evening and tjie morning were the fourth
day.” He didn’t harass the printer with the
gloaming and the sunset, and the moons
rising and setting, and the false dawn, and
the dark hour afterwards, and the sunrise
and the garish noon and the other frills. He
just pulled the trigger, and the gun went off
in nine words, and the most wonderful period
in the world’s record was bagged right there.

Anthony Horderns Vor Underwear
1 u
MNfl
,, *
N common with all wearing
apparel, woven underwear
has been subjected to sub-
stantial increases in price
since the advent of the war. These
rises are the concomitants of higher
cost and scarcity of the raw material.
The cost of some of the world-
renowned makes of underwear
offered at Anthony Horderns’ for
man, woman and child has been
tardily increased by the manufac-
turers, but as prices must further
advance, the advisability of purchas-
ing now should be recognised.
If one does not buy when goods are
offered, a second opportunity to pur-
chase may not be presented. We
offer the opportunity to-day to pur-
chase at prices that cannot be re-
peated when the present shipment is
exhausted.
The big stocks of Womens and
Children’s Underwear, in Wool,
Wool and Cotton, and Silk, ordered
for last Winter but delivered quite
recently, were purchased at prices
considerably below to-day’s values
in London, America and at the
Continental sources of supply; in-
deed, some of the makes are to-day
almost unobtainable.
Purchasing now the goods that were
bought under such favourable con-
ditions is advice that discriminating
o
people will not overlook.
We reiterate the statement —these goods could
not be duplicated to-day. Be wise, Pop your
orders in the post.
Anthony Horderns’ Winter Fashion Portfolio,
also the price list of Izod’s Corsets and Ladies’
Lingerie, should be in every home —write for s

To suffer with fortitude is
heroic, but to suffer needlessly
is idiotic. While most sufferers
regard pain as due to the
dispensation of Providence,
doctors see in it a certain
neglect—the neglect of simple
rules of health.
OF all rheumatic afflictions acute lumbago is the
most painful. It arises from a gradual accumu-
lation of excess uric acid in the system ; the muscles of
the lower back become impregnated until the muscu-
lar fibres stiffen and every movement causes agony.
The simple habit of taking Kruschen Salts every
morning cleanses the system of excess uric acid, braces
the nerves and gives to the user the daily enjoyment
of natural vigorous health. Get the Kruschen habit.

The Birth.
The Crisis fell upon the world—
The vast, epochal night—
Wherein titanic figures moved
Shed round with crimson light.
The Empires, red with smoking blood,
In hugest conflict swayed.
The shocked, stunned Earth with eyes agaj
Beheld the strife dismayed.
Then, as war’s lightnings smote the won
With jagged stab and rent,
A wonder quickening through our blood
Foretold the Great Event.
Though we had scaled ridge after ridge.
The top heights towered unwon;
We might not breast the world, and stai
Full-statured in the sun.
For this is truth and ancient truth —
As old as mother earth —
In war and strenuous war hlone
Strong nations have their birth.
Thus, while our manhood fought and fell
On war-fields far away,
All night the spirit of our land
In groaning travail lay.
We waited, hushed through that dread night,
Expectant of the morn,
Till suddenly a trumpet called:
“Be joyful; she is born!”
We dressed her in a robe of light,
We christened her with blood;
We shouted as we named her name—
That name is Nationhood!
Hark then, O sons, inheritors,
Of whatsoever day;
Thus came the life unto the flesh,
The spirit to the clay.

Carry On.
I love not these long fields of France
Through which I tramp to make romance
For some slim youth who, years ahead,
Will whistle love where I lie dead.
I hate the cold grey rain and snow.
The broken mists that come and go;
The ceaseless death and ruin flung
’Mid chatter of a half-guessed tongue.
O God, to see the sun again
Rise red above the Bathurst plain!
To scent the wattle in the night
Where Cootamundra lambs run white!
N’importe! A man is born to die.
Blithely I fall beneath this sky ;
Australian dust to Europe’s sod,
To make a path for man to God.
Peace waits her hour with joys to bring,
The inarching bugles yet shall sing;
And, blood-redeemed, a world shall rise
Made clean in our red sacrifice.

JOAN.
The Father,
In the midst of the bright lights, with her
fiddle from Italy,
ITerself but the slip of a girl on the stage
there for all to see,
With the eyes of her like twin moths caught
in the flame of Her white face;
’Tis the wind in the trees they be seeing, and
a high star maybe.
Tis proud I am of her playing, though never
a tune at all
Can I catch in the silver notes, like rain-
drops in the early morn,
With no beginning or ending; now like the
song of the waterfall
Hid in the "W exford Hills nearby where her
mother was born.
But ’tis the old tunes I do be wanting—the
- jigs and “Rory O’Alore,”
And the girls and the boys and the tales
they were telling of old times,
With the handful of turf glowing red, and
its gleam on the four walls,
And M : chael the dark man making high
music and rhymes.
’Tis “Dublin Bay” I am wanting, and the
girl’s mother singing it,
She with the skin like the wild rose, and
the hair that held wind and sun ;
And her mother again making lace by the
light of one penny candle,
Blinding the grey eyes one time dancing with
fun.
Fears and sorrows we knew’, and a white
hope that laughed above all,
Braving our hearts for the new lands shin-
ing beyond the grey seas,
And an old man will be thinking his
thoughts, but the young girl surely
Cannot lift the veil of his dreams and his
memories.
Her fiddle grows, still, and all the grand
people about me
Are clapping their hands, ’tis like a great
wave on the shore ;
But the pr-soned moths of her eyes are read-
ing the soul of me—
you’ve caught my heart in your bow,
it’s the old tunes you are nlaying,
asthore!

PEACE BY NEGOTIATION.
Fob several weeks prior to August, 1914,
negotiations Jo maintain peace went on 24
hours a day. One side was honest; the other
dishonest. The honesty had its foundation
in a great anxiety to avoid war; the dis-
honesty in a fixed determination to force a
war that had been long prepared for
and to take the loot that had long
been coveted. Wherefore those peace
negotiations were a failure, likewise a
farce. Since then they have been nego-
tiating with bombs, and the side with
the biggest bomb at the finish is the side that
will take the chair when serious talk begins
about what shall happen next. At rock-
bottom all the statements as to the war aims
of the Allies have not much more than
academic interest now. Nor is it of much
moment whether the German since the war
has discovered that he wants more or less
than he contemplated getting at the begin-
ning. The fundamental fact is that, the
negotiations to prevent slaughter having col-
lapsed because one of the parties insisted on
bloodshed being a preliminary to settlement,
each side has been busy ever since trying to
batter its enemy into a condition th#t will
compel him to accept peace on a revised
basis. Meanwhile, appalled by the red
tragedy of this hideous struggle, and seeing
nothing ahead but moral and other disaster,
many well-meaning citizens in every country
are beginning to ask for a negotiated peace
•—for an effort to discover whether the butch-
ery that has proceeded so far has not been
ample enough to bring all hands into a more
conciliatory state of mind. In some places
the man who asks for this is called an enemy
to his country—in Germany, for instance ; and
in Britain, too, if he happens to be anything
less than an earl. In Russia requests for
negotiations with the German were recently
reconcilable among the proletariat with the
highest wisdom. What the proletariat thinks
of it to-day there is no means of knowing,
but the obvious result of the negotiating has
been that the Kaiser carves the duck. Here
in Australia, remote from the shambles and
ill-informed about the progress of events, the
individual who clamors for negotiating with
the enemy is usually eounted-out. This is a
foolish proceeding. The honest advocate of
negotiation may be as good a citizen as the
noisiest Win-the-War barracker, and is quite
entitled to be argued with as a reasonable
being. The trouble with him in nine cases
out of ten is an inability to see that so far
the Allies are not in a position to get any
other kind of peace than one framed by Ger-
many—that the choice is not between peace
and war, but between resistance to German
mastery and surrender.
* * * *
Peace could be obtained to-morrow by the
Allies if they agreed to the German terms.
These to all of them would be calamitous, to
some of them ruinous. The German has im-
posed terrible conditions upon the Russians.
He would be no less harsh on others. He has
given no sign of being ready to make peace
except by the sword, and for that reason it
is as futile to talk about negotiating with
him except on the basis of accomplished
military fact as to blow bubbles into the air
and call them next year’s wheat harvest. In
the circumstances of the hour use of the
word “negotiation” is really a clumsy exercise
in verbal camouflage, for the bitter truth is
that there is no opening for parley with the
Kaiser which does not involve an admission
of German victories. That the German
would readily come to terms if these were
admitted cannot be doubted, for there would
then be scarcely anything left for him to con-
tinue fighting for—certainly nothing that
would be worth the hideous waste of life and
material involved in prolonging the disturb-
ance. More than once Berlin has expressed
a willingness to make peace—a German
peace. And it is just this that the Western
Allies cannot make until they are persuaded
that there is no hope of making any other;
for such a peace would place the world’s few
democracies in a position of shivering sub-
serviency to an armed autocracy. It is no
use trying to minimise the tremendous power
of the German or to discount the magnitude
of the job before the Allies; and that present
job is to escape having to negotiate. It is
not only that the material loss to them
would be gigantic if the German had his will,
but the freedom of half the world would
have to be bartered away.
* * * *
If at the end of the fighting German rapa-
city has not been restrained, then the earth
will be the Prussian’s oyster. In the mean-
time the main question: is whether the
struggle to keep him back from the plunder
should be continued or whether he should be
handed the spoil forthwith. That and only
that is what “peace by negotiation” means.
What can we answer? Russian, Roumanian,
Servian' and Belgian experiences cry aloud a
warning against throwing in the towel. And
the resources of the countries still able to
argue the point against the German are so
strong that there is no compulsion whatever
upon them to sign their own death-warrant.
American intervention in the war is bringing
against the German a force infinitely more
powerful than Russia. No matter what vic-
tories—short of those that are overwhelming
—the enemy may gain against the heavily-
pressed armies now in France, he still has
to deal with a determined and resourceful
opponent on land and sea before these vic-
tories can bring him anything. Even were
the enemy to engulf France before the
American armies are strong enough to turn
the tide, the sea would be closed to him and
the war would still go on. And while the war
lasts the German is bleeding, and suffering
grim privation behind the lines. The longer it
goes on, the more determinedly the Allies
fight, the better is their chance of dodging
the disaster that would be in the nature of a
cataclysm if peace transpired on the basis of
existing circumstances. It is merely stupid
to pretend that the outlook is cheerful. It is
infernally dark. But it would be darker still
if the Allies intimated that they were ready
to cave in. The rout of the German in the
ordinary military sense of the term is pro-
bably as remote a as the annihila-
tion of space. But defeat of German ambi-
tions that would mean enslavement to most
of the world is certain if the Allies hold fa?t.
That they may do so is something that Aus-
tralians should be, praying for. There are
one or two countries in which a negotiated
peace might not be cause for great tribula-
tion. Australia is not one of them. No
peace could be negotiated with Germany now
which would not make Australia another
country, and that quickly.
ABOUT DOING MORE WORK.
When the war began to reveal its true in-
wardness, which happened early, it was
plainly up to Australia, to Do More Work—
not necessarily more work for less pay, or
even for the same old pay, but More Work.
A large number of men had gone to the
Front, and it was the business of those who
remained to spread themselves out so as to
cover the gaps in the ranks of industry—in
other words to do the absentees’ share of
toil. Also there were new war charges to
pay. Further, it was quite obvious that
the flotation of so-called Public Works loans
in England was finished for the time being.
This meant that the interest on old loans
which used to be paid indirectly out of new
loans must be paid when existing accumula-
tions of gold ran short by the' proceeds of
Extra Work. It also meant that the abun-
dance of goods which came from England
to represent part of the proceeds of these
loans (for none of the proceeds ever came'
in the form of money), and to avert the
establishment of local industries, and to
prevent our people learning the more difficult
and more elaborate industries, must be either
dispensed with or replaced by local products.
To replace them meant More Work—an
awful lot More Work, for in very many cases
it was a matter of learning how to do the
work and acquiring the ABC! of the business.
No other country of importance in all the
world was so helpless as Australia, which
is to say that no other great country was so
deeply indebted to foreign lenders, and that
in turn is to say that no other country
depended so much on foreign goods. Aus-
tralia has been run for many years by three
parties. First there were the Protectionists,
never so strenuous and whole-hearted as they
should have been, but still honest patriots
who believed that Australians were not de-
signed by Providence to be mere raisers of
sheep and cattle like the patriarchs in Gen-
esis, or hewers of trees and draggers of wool,
but were fitted for high-class industry as
well. Then there were the Freetraders, an
intensely supercilious gang of fools and
traitors, who professed that the creed of Aus-
tralian industry—except in the Gibeonite or
beast-of-burden line —was harmless lunacy.
They had all the self-importance and in-
tolerance of the Prussian junker, and the
proportion of Germanic names outside their
importing warehouses was remarkable.
Finally, there was the Labor party which
“sank "the fiscal issue” and professed to move
among such lofty aspirations that a small
question like the establishment of a self-
reliant, self-dependent nation was beneath
its official notice.
* * * *
Hence the community wasn’t in good form
to meet the sudden need to do More Work.
The city and town population in particular
was accustomed to short hours and long
wages and the highest standard of living;
in fact, it is living even now on a scale that
sundry European kings can’t attain to. It
had almost the maximum number of holi-
days. It could afford to raise an industrial
dispute over almost anything. No doubt
these good conditions may be very much fur-
ther improved when much better machinery
is devised in the future; but the future
hasn’t arrived yet. The only thing here is
the present. Australia isn’t like Italy, a
country with no gold-mines and hardly any
coal or iron. It was never driven to learn
how to make things for itself by reason of
blockade or ship famine. The products of
the more difficult arts dropped on it from
Heaven per medium of the omnipresent
foreign loan, so its so-called manufactures
are still largely dependent on foreign dyes,
foreign machinery, foreign materials of all
sorts. Even the appalling interest bill
caused little trouble so long as a big, fresh
lOU could be put on the market. The mass
of the people have scarcely realised even yet
that their abundant paper money is only
waste paper when it is a question of paying
the foreign bill or buying the usual and
allegedly indispensable foreign goods, and
that it is no substitute for Work. There has
been a wide-spread opinion that because
this is a “free country,” though it is the
most abject slave to the foreign capitalist
and manufacturer and shipowner, all must be
well. If things went wrong the one essen-
tial was more “freedom.” No community
ever faced the necessity for a Lot More Work
with a much worse equipment.
It can’t be said that the community as a
whole has risen to the occasion. There has
been no strenuous weeding out of the hid-
eously overgrown State Public Services.
There had been no stoppage in the creation
of new offices and new jobs and new sal-
aries. And there is either a gigantic con-
spiracy, mostly in the cities, to ruin the
country and foment insurrection in the
interests of the Huns, or else there has been
developed an amount of ignorance and men-
tal incapacity which almost passes belief.
The demand for shorter hours of labor goes
on as usual. Piecework, even if it is accom-
panied by better pay, is denounced as bit-
terly as ever, apparently because it may
inspire an ambition to Do More Work.
Stoppages of work—i.o., strikes—have in-
creased wonderfully. It has been laid down
even more strenuously than usual that any
persons who interfere with or try to nullify
a vast and wholly illegal strike or hold-up
of the community by doing some Work are
a species of criminal, and should be treated
with loathing. An unaccountable paralysis
has settled on the biggest attempt to start
Accomplishing a .Job—the shipbuilding job
—and without any visible quarrel or ani-
mosity it simply doesn’t move. But all man-
ner of strange quacks and Judds have arisen
to show how they alone can save tht country
for an adequate inducement, and to paste
their infallible brain-cure advertisement on
the dead wall of the occasion. In their
simple gospel the , increase in the cost of
living isn’t, in any way owing to the fact
that we depend to a greater degree than any
other people on other people’s goods brought
here in other people’s ships, so that they can
fix the price at their own sweet will unless
local Work deprives them of their monopoly.
It is all owing to the schemes of the local
distributor. No one dare say much about
the foreign distributor, for he is out of
reach. The crippling of public works
doesn’t happen because Bull in London will
no longer lend Holman in Sydney £9,000,000
of gold or gold values in a year to obviate
Work, but will lend him nothing at all. It is
because Holman has “conspired”—probably
disguised and holding converse with his fel-
low minions in a cellar at midnight—to
“starve” the people and bring them into sub-
jection to Thingumbob, and hand them over
bound and helpless to Whatsisname. Flat
revolution has been suggested; matters are
to be taken out of the hands of the Parlia-
ment chosen by pure adult suffrage, and
legislation by the majority is to give place
to “direct action” by somebody—possibly
Judd. There has been a Labor pronounce-
ment about raising abundant loans some-
how, from somebody, without interest. The
red flag has been hoisted to some extent. A
union proposal for repudiating the public
debt has been hoisted. Almost everything
has been hoisted except the statement that
it has become necessary to Do More Work.
* * * *
The Federal Government has done all
that was humanly possible without touching
on plain industry and plain economy. It
hasn’t weeded out its Public Service, or
diminished its Ministerial motor-car and
travelling expenses. It hasn’t ceased from
inventing asinine Boards and Commissions.
It hasn’t put a prohibitive duty on foreign
luxuries. It hasn’t passed a 75 or 100. per
cent, general tariff to come in force auto-
matically when peace is established with
Germany or Austria or both, so that manu-
facturers could start new industries with
the assurance that they wouldn’t be wiped
out by competition whenever the Hun was in
a position to resume business at the old
address. To do so would seem too much
like talking about Work. It hasn’t even
made serious use of the War Precautions
Act against those who openly denounced or
secretly conspired against Plain, Steady
Toil. But at raising the wind by ordinary
and extraordinary borrowing, by common
or garden loans and loans with frills, by
postponing liabilities, by sidelong “accommo-
dation” methods, by getting Bull to back
the bill and hold over the p.n. and make
an advance on the goods before delivery,
and such-like doings, it has been marvellous.
By the time this war is over Treasurer
Watt should know enough to sell pork that
doesn’t exist to an imaginary Hebrew and
get away with the money.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Two Huns Look Forward.
The German Government, regarding con-
cealment as superfluous, has published the
terms of the new treaty between the Two
Huns. It is to last 25 years, and by it Ger-
many and Austria “pledge themselves to
employ the entire strength of their people
for military purposes.” They “shall devote
all their care to have their armies fully pre-
pared to enter an eventual future conflict at
their maximum strength .” Before this war
is ended, whether it ends by Hun victory or
by a Hun failure and the wheedling of easy
terms out of the easy-going Allies, the next
war has been decided on. It is impossible
to grab all the earth this time, but the
balance is to be grabbed later on. The pre-
parations are already in hand. There must
be a next war when a country devotes its
•“entire strength” to military purposes,
because it can’t keep on in that condition
indefinitely without being ruined. When a
boxer devotes all his time to training for a
fight with a big prize attached, he wants to
have that fight when he is at his best; if he
just keeps on training till he is old and the
training expenses have made him bankrupt,
he gets no prize. But the next war isn’t to
be like this one. There is to be no repeti-
tion of the mistake of 1914. It is to be an
affair of a few weeks or months only. Every
man and gun and ship and all the aeroplanes
and tanks and all the gas are to be ready on
the first day. And then the enemy who
requires even two weeks to mobilise his
forces will be a week too late. It is a fine
outspoken programme. By all means let us
negotiate with the Two Huns!
Labor and the War.
Though its principal contention is knocked
out by what has happened at the Sydney
Trades Hall during the past week, the sub-
joined article is still well worth the earnest
attention of Australia, inasmuch as it comes
from one who, while having a long experi-
ence as a State Labor Minister, still retains
his place in the Labor Party. That party
to-day is divided into two sections. With
one it is no use arguing; the views of the
other, represented at its best by the writer
of the following explanation, or defence, or
whatever you like to call it, ought to have
earnest consideration in order that what he
and'his section regard as hindrances to re-
cruiting may, if possible, be removed: —
In The Bulletin's leading article of May 9 Labor
is charged with a Yes-No attitude towards the war.
It is charged with being sullen, contradictory and
hedging in its war policy or want of policy, and with
refusing to define its true position. Will you let me
say something in defence ?
The war policy of the Labor party is compulsory
training and service for home defence, and voluntary
enlistment for service abroad. In the present
upheaval it is just as anxious to see Germany beaten
as Joe Cook or Billy Hughes can be. It has proved
this in many ways. Labor men are' away fighting
and have sent their sons; unions have contributed
their thousands. This is the best possible test of
loyalty. There may be a section, a very small one,
that would have peace at whatever price it could be
bought. It is, however, a negligible quantity and
really does not count; but its loud voice is often
mistaken for the true voice of Labor. Labor realises,
although anxious to see the end of the war, that the
present is no time to think of negotiations, with
Germany on top, and that we must continue to fight
on until our military outlook is better, before we
can hope for a • settlement that will amply protect
future generations from similar disturbances. The
same Labor opposed Conscription, not because it did
not want to help to win the war, but largely because
it meant placing a dangerous power in the hands of
an untrustworthy and discredited Government that
muddled and continues to muddle everything it
touches. It was- driven to more strenuous opposition
by the bitter and vilifying statements and charges
made by members of the Government and its sup-
porters. We do not expect the Hun to love us when
we call him a barbarian, nor can we expect an Aus-
tralian to work in harmony with the man who hurls
similar epithets at him. Labor considered that volun-
taryism had done well, and would continue to do as
well as we needed if the right steps were taken.
Admittedly, then, Labor is sullen and has not
joined in candid co-operation with the Government.
But surely it will be conceded that there is some
reason for this, even though there may be those who
doubt whether the attitude is right.
I do put it most earnestly that Labor is justified
in feeling that something is very wrong. Equality
of sacrifice is the first and fundamental principle of
democracy. The men who have gone over the sea,
whether the sons of rich or poor, have made theirs.
But wealth has made none ; instead, its owners have
“dug in” to protect their money. Not only has
invested capital made no sacrifice, but rather it has
reaped enormous increased profits as a result of the
war. Millions are awaiting investment in Australia.
Every legal and banking firm and thousands of pri-
vate individuals have large sums waiting investment
in safe securities; and yet the Government has had
to appeal to the school-children for money to carry-
on the war. Dividends have increased, filched in the
first place from the public, and largely from the
dependants of those who are away fighting. The
result is that a Government which had the power
to prevent this position, but deliberately shirked
the responsibility, has now to buy money at a high
rate of interest, free of income tax.
Even with these inducements the rich have found
it more profitable to invest their money in other
securities made gilt-edged by war. If investment
in established securities had been prevented—except
for the purpose of extension of business —plenty of
money would have been available for war purposes
at reasonable rates of interest, and capital could
have made an equality of sacrifice. Instead of this
the Government practically prevented the raising of
capital for the establishment of new businesses, and
allowed investment where the. only benefit was per-


sonal, not national. These Government-protected
dollar-hunters are amongst those who are shouting
for further sacrifices. Labor is not blind, and,
after all, it is but human. The profiteering pirate
is able to continue to batten on the helpless and
unprotected, when it was so easy for those in power
to prevent it, instead of fooling the public with a
hollow pretence of price-fixing. Meanwhile the
profiteer has been conspicuous on the platform and
elsewhere, urging co-operation of the exploiter and
the exploited. It is almost more than human nature
can stand.
It is considered by some, especially by those con-
trolling industry and prices, a crime for the worker
to strike in order to get a higher price for the com-
modity that he has to sell, viz., labor, but almost
a virtue in the man who legally gets the same
result for himself by simply raising prices. The
unionist has been displaced, in some cases by men
of enemy birth, and his children left to starve,
because he has dared to do what is done by the
profiteering patriot every day. All strikes, for
higher wages even, may not be justified, but every
commercial strike for the purpose of getting higher
profits in war time is criminal. The commercial
thief asks the displaced worker to co-operate. How
would you feel if you were the out-of-work unionist?
Again, some political leaders in high places have
raised the sectarian issue and implied that Irishmen
are disloyal. Leading newspapers in all the States
have fanned this slumbering feud, branding them
all with disloyalty. Is this attitude conducive to
the co-operation of the Irish?
Can it be wondered at that the insulted becomes
sullen, when he has probably sent his son to fight
for the privileged insulter? It is rather a wonder
that he doe's not become rebellious.
These are just a few reasons why Labor has lost
a good deal of enthusiasm for co-operation. There
are others. They jnay not perhaps serve as a com-
plete justification, but they are reasons, human
reasons, and good ones too. Labor is not deaf nor
blind. It has the faculty of thought and has human
feelings. It can be made responsive if the Govern-
ment will throw off its unholy alliance with privi-
lege and wealth, and come right down among the
people.

After “Peace by Negotiation.”
Russia, having “ceased hostilities” and made
“peace by negotiation” with the Hun, as the
organs and mouthpieces of the Labor party
urge that the British Empire should do, is
still reaping the advantages. The Ilun
armies tramp along just the same after
peace as before, save that, the deluded Rus-
sians having overthrown their anti-Hun
Government and demobilised their armies,
there has ceased to be any serious opposi-
tion. The first frontier line was fixed
greatly to Russia’s loss. The ink on the
blessed “peace” was scai'cely dry when a
new frontier was demanded, to the miserable
country’s much greater loss. Then the Hun
tramped gaily over that. Petrograd has
been practically abandoned to him. Now the
Hun is moving fast on the older capital,
Moscow. The still older capital, Kieff, has
fallen, and the local Assembly, established
as a sign of the new era of freedom, has
been chased off the premises. Russia lately
asked officially where its visitor _ means
to stop—in other words, where he will erect
a third frontier of broken promises and
violated oaths, similar to the previous two.
He gives no definite answer, for he doesn’t
mean to stop anywhere, in particular, and
he hardly regards the broken country as
worth lying to nowadays. His officials are
being appointed everywhere to permanently
run the show. Russians are working as
slaves for him with only bare sustenance as
their remuneration. They are also already
being conscripted into his army. All the
food that can be stolen over and above that
required by the army of occupation is going
to Germany. The two Hun agents or dupes
who mainly engineered the awful revolution
and controlled the Bolshevik Government or
Anarchy are little heard of now. Their gloz-
ing perjuries about negotiation and peace and
brotherhood and the pulling down of local
“tyrants” is no longer useful currency. But
their phrases and catchwords have a wide
circulation in Australia. This country
seems to be getting consignments of left-
off Bolshevik vocabulary made in Germany.
And it isn’t even re-written_ to make a pre-
tence of fitting the conditions of a com-
munity which has man-and-womanhood suf-
frage, free elections, free education, no
hereditary aristocracy (barring Bigjohn
Fobrest, and he has no heir), no established
church, and no oppressive military caste.
Officialdom Welcomes Billjim with 6d.
One of these days when it is a year or so
older The Bulletin expects to meet some-
thing like this in the latest edition of its
evening paper : *
It is rumored that the Australian army has re-
turned from Europe, the last transport having landed
her complement of men seven weeks ago. When
asked whether there was any truth in the rumor the
officer in command at headquarters said he had no
information on the subject. In any case none of
the men had reported to him. Pending a definite
statement by the Minister, he assumed that the
army was still in England or somewhere.
Then several days later Pearce will discover
that his Intelligence Department had been
asleep and will suddenly explain how the
arrival of the army came to be overlooked.
What actually happened last week seemed
a first instalment of all this. Someone casu-
ally discovered that 50 men belonging to the
First Division had been sent back for a couple
of months’ furlough in Australia. These
men had been prowling about in the ordi-
nary way for some time, and the only notice
taken of them, so far, at any rate, as Syd-
ney is concerned, had been to give them 6d.
a day—except that one man’s wife who had
been receiving an allowance from the Syd-
ney Mayor’s fund discovered that the return
of her husband had been the signal for cut-
ting off supplies. The whole business was
disgraceful, and the excuse made by Pearce
that he was ignorant of the men’s arrival
merely another instance of that calamitous
person’s habitual lack of information about
anything that matters. These men had been
in the field for nearly four years, and be-
cause Australia has a Defence Department
of unfathomable ineptitude they got about
as w r arm a welcome to their homeland as if
they had happened into Tierra-del-Fuego.
A< Pearce appears to live about a fortnight
behind the time-table, this paper puts it to
the Government once more that the time is
ripe to get further assistance. Then the
public might have a reasonable chance of
doing the decent thing.
The Hughes-oh Doctrine.
W. M. Hughes has been talking amid
alleged American applause about a Monroe
doctrine for the Pacific. It is a high-sound-
ing thing; but what does it mean? When,
in 1823, the Monroe doctrine was first
enunciated, the American continent was in
a state of revolt from European control.
Chile became independent in 1810, Paraguay
in 1811, the Colombian States in 1819 and
Peru in 1821. In Brazil an empire had just
been set up, and all over the South and Centre
republics had either been formed or were in
course of formation. The Monroe doctrine
was a plain statement to the kings of
Europe that the United States, then feeling
for the first time their power and importance
in the world, would tolerate no interference
from without with the affairs of the infant
democracies which were trying to find their
feet. There is no sort of parallel in the
condition of the Pacific to-day. If Samoa,
New Caledonia, Fiji and the other groups of
the Pacific were infant democracies strug-
gling to maintain a footing Australia might
be prepared to take all risks for their defence
and support. Does Hughes propose to
assist them to first achieve and then main-
tain their independence? If he doesn’t, talk
of “a Monroe doctrine for the Pacific” is
mere nonsense. If he does, then Australia
has a right to be consulted, though how we
are going to shift France out of New Cale-
donia and the United States out of Honolulu
we don’t know. Perhaps W. M. Hughes
doesn’t either.

The Great Chops and Steak Issue.
When it was announced a few weeks ago
that the Federal Government intended to act
upon the findings of the Inter-State Com-
mission and fix the wholesale price of meat
on the basis of export prices, the yell from
the opulent stock-owner nearly scared
Hughes out of his wits. So, on the ground
that the owner of fat and other beasts should
be given a further hearing, the first report
was pushed back to the Commission with
instructions to report again. Report No. 2
having been handed in, it is the Ministry’s
turn to play. Two courses are open to it.
It can either sit tight and allow the public to
be fleeced or carrv out the original inten-
tion. That the public has been fleeced is
not doubted by any impartial inquirer. The
governing facts are simple. There are more
sheep in Australia than there wer,e before the
war and as many cattle. Export prices are
over 50 per cent, higher. Yet the prices for
home consumption are up near the sky. The
pre-war export returns were profitable to
growers. Current export prices are still
more profitable. This disposes of the plea
that it would ruin the grazier if meat were
sold in Melbourne or Sydney for local con-
sumption at a price equal to that paid for
meat for export. The plea is, in truth, a
clumsy and obvious fabrication. It is an
injustice that the local consumer should pay
more, and everybody knows it. As a general
thing, the demand for price-fixing on rule-of-
thumb lines makes no appeal to this paper.
But here the supply of the goods is well
under control, and the Government can make
no mistake. If the Acting Prime Minister has
half as much grit as he is credited with, and
if his colleagues have any regard for the
public interests, they will give the meat com-
bine a signal to work on a new price-list.
But the explanation given the other day in
the House of Reps., that Ministers are con-
sidering an alternative course to that recom-
mended by the Inter-State Commission, raises
a strong suspicion of cold feet.
The Oil-drum in the Far North.
The little strike at Mount Elliott mine
(Q.), which had its beginning in the refusal
of the management to re-instate an engine-
driver who had been sacked for allowing an
oil-drum (the company’s property) to fall
on a man’s head (the man’s property), is
significant in a way. The merits of the
case don’t signify, but the clumsiness of the
procedure does. Queensland enjoys one-
adult-one-vote both in Federal and State
affairs. There is no property qualification for
members. State members receive £3OO a year,
free railway pass, travelling expenses at
election time to the place of nomination and
back again, and £2 a month for postage-
stamps and telegrams; so the poorest man
has a chance. It has the most strenuous
Labor Government in Australia and a splen-
did Labor majority behind the Govei’nment
—at the election of 1915, which put Premier
Ryan in office, 45 Laborites were returned
in an Assembly of 72. The nominee Upper
House, which has an unlimited membership,
can be swamped by the Labor Government
if necessary. Yet the number of strikes
was greater in 1916, the first complete year
of complete Labor rule, than before, and
measured by the number of days’ work lost
that year was nearly seven times worse
than 1914, the last complete year of non-
Labor control. Also the third quarter of
1917, under complete Labor rule, was nearly
10 times worse than 1914, under non-Labor
rule. If strikes are an honest protest
against premeditated injustice, then Labor
rule seems to be many times more unjust
to labor —in Queensland, anyhow—than
Liberal rule. If they are a necessary pro-
test against incapacity, then Labor rule in
Queensland app.ears to be a much greater
failure than the other variety. If they
represent a tendency to cripple Australia so
that it will be less able to do its bit against
the Hun, then they fall into a different
category. But it is a melancholy joke for
trades-union influences to raise such a loud
voice for Peace by Negotiation if they can’t
settle their own disputes by negotiation with
their own statutes. The principle of the big
strike —the one that covers a lot of ground
and affects a large number of people—is
Frightfulness. When, for instance, it stops
railway and tramway services and food sup-
plies. it doesn’t grievously inconvenience
the Ministry, w’hicli has its own motor-cars
paid for out of the Treasury, and which has
enough ramifications and influences and
chances of underground engineering to get
its own loaf and chop even in hard times.
But it is expected to inflict so much misery
on non-combatants, just as the Huns did in
Belgium and Servia on a larger scale, that
they will drive the Government to surrender.
It includes a lot of helpless people, just as
the Huns do when they drop bombs on hos-
pitals, so it is a humble branch of the same
family tree. But the supreme aggravation
in a State like Queensland is that the people
have given to the party which is controlled
by the unions absolute power to make such
laws as it thinks fit, so that there will be no
need for industrial wars; wherefore the
business seems very like the case of a king
who drops bombs on his own loyal subjects
to conceal his ignorance of the best way to
govern them. It is a mixed situation, partly
humorous and partly tragic.
The Wheat Elevators.
The new Board of Trade, which has just
been appointed in N. S. Wales, ought to get
promptly to work and find out whether the
State isn’t going to pay an absurdly ex-
travagant price for its grain elevators; if it
is, obviously the producing interests of the
country will be still further and unneces-
sarily handicapped. According to a Parlia-
mentary paper just issued: —
The price for the elevators, complete with
machinery, and based on cement at not more than
13s. per cask and steel at not more than £2B
per ton, is for terminals (Sydney 3,000,000 bushels,
since raised to 5,000,000 bushels, and Newcastle
700,000 bushels), 3s. 6d. per bushel. For the country
elevators (total storage, 13,750,000 bushels) the
price was 2s. 3d. per bushel.
Subsequent amendments were made, the
effect being to slightly increase these prices.
Yet early this year Frank Coffee, a well-
known Sydney business man, who of recent
years has interested himself keenly in agri-
cultural developments in Australia and
Canada, wrote the results of his personal
inquiries in America, whence he came origin-
ally. He said : —■
In 1917, on airival in Vancouver, 1 obtained from
Mr. Mcßeatii, manager of the Vancouver Elevators,
a report on cost and capacity. Vancouver elevators
will hold 3,000,000 bushels and cost £140,000.
At the 3s. 6d. per bushel which the N. S.
Wales Government proposes to pay for the
Sydney elevators, a 3,000,000-bushel job
would cost £525,000. The difference between
that and the Vancouver cost gives the
Canadian farmer £23,100 less interest to
pay every year, taking the rate at 6 p.c.
The difference between Canadian costs for
country elevators and the proposed Austra-
lian costs is even greater. Frank Coffee’s
figures may be hopelessly wrong. But they
have every appearahce of having been care-
fully collected ; and it is certainly somebody’s
duty to get at the truth. If it is not the
Board of Trade’s job to ascertain what
others are doing and endeavor to See that
N. S. Wales producers are put on at least
an equally good footing, then there is no rea-
son why it should exist at all. The outcome
may be awkward for the Government. But
it is no easier for the farmer to be handi-
capped by the Government’s blunders than
by anybody else’s.
Australia’s Danger from Malaria.
“Plas. Fai.c.” : The likelihood of malaria-
carriers being a regular feature in Australia,
as prophesied by “A.A.M.C.” (B. 23/5/’18),
is borne out by the experience of the troops
who returned from Rabaul in 1915. These
men had been under constant quinine pro-
tective treatment, and showed very few cases
until they left the tropics. Directly the
transports got into cool latitudes the men
went down in scores. The Americans had
the same experience with troops returning
from Porto Rico. The quinine seemed to be
able to hold the parasites in check until the
system was depressed, by cold. The method
which “A.A.M.C.” ascribes to Ochner really
dates back to 1906 or earlier, and it has
been found in practice that the possibility
of a double infection makes it less reliable
than the method of keeping a constant
strength of quinine in the blood, sufficient
to prevent the breaking-up of the circulating
organism, with the consequent release of the
poisonous substances which produce the
fever and other constitutional disturbances.
This means large doses —up to 40 or 60
grains or more daily—for quite a period. The
object of using arsenic salts (soamin, not
606) is to get at the parasites in the bone
marrow and spleen, where they cannot be
reached by quinine. Intravenous injection
is required when a rapid effect is necessary
to save life. Those who have to protect them-
selves from malaria will do best by trying
to prevent infection by the careful use of a
good net. and, next, by making sure that
the quinine which they take to keep off in-
fection is in a soluble form. The ordinary
hard pill or tablet does not dissolve in the
stomach or intestine, and hence does not
reach the blood where the parasites are. The
best of the ordinary salts of quinine is the
acid sulphate (bisulphate), the plain sul-
phate being rather insoluble. It is best
taken from the original bottle, either in a
capsule (gelatine capsules for the purpose
can be obtained from any good chemist, with
the quinine), or in a cigarette paper. Water
and a dash of lime-juice —or whisky is an-
other method. For protective purposes it is
better to depend on one or two substantial
doses weekly, according to the amount of
malaria estimated to be in the neighborhood,
say of 15 grains each, than on the usual
five grains a day. The big dose disables the
parasite before it has time to develop. The
results in the way of imaginary bells and
bands playing are not always pleasant, but
then neither is a dose of malaria. No form of
quinine protection is quite certain, but it
gives, if properly carried out, a fair chance.
Breaking Down.
The manufactures and some other industries
of this country continue to break down or
hang up throueh lack of imported materials
or imported machinery. The Sydney match
factory closed because the high price of
imported materials couldn’t be squared with
the selling price as fixed by law. Factories
which import only some of their materials
can keep going, but the Sydney one, accord-
ing to the published statement, imported the
whole lot. The Sydney glass industry has
discharged employees wholesale and cut
down its operations for the same reasons,
and other glass factories are expected to
follow. A big Hobart jam factory has
sacked 400 workers and left contracts for
7,000,0001 b. of jam on the shelf because it
can’t get the imported tinplates. Orders
for imported tinplates sent out two years
ago are still unfilled, and nobody knows when
they will be filled. This country supplies the
tin abundantly, but British tinplates come
in free, and other kinds, including Hun, pay
only 10 per cent. Even the 10 per cent,
doesn’t nearly cover the difference created
by higher wages, shorter hours .and more
holidays. And though the interruption of
imports by war equals a big tariff while the
war lasts, yet the war won’t last for ever,
and unless the tariff is pushed up now as a
guarantee of good faith, no big industry will
start and face the risk of being thrown over-
board and losing all its capital when the Hun
caves in. No bank would lend a customer
money to finance a precarious gamble of that
sort, and the wonderful, importer-ridden Gov-
ernment does nothing and doesn’t even
promise anything. Now it transpires that
the Papuan oil industry is held up. We
have the raw material, and we want the oil
very badly, but the boring machinery is im-
ported—or rather it can’t be imported just
now. As for the shipbuilding industry the
best we can do is to let contracts to build
a few small arks in 24 months; and the out-
look for the tinned meat industry isn’t good,
for the reasons which trouble the jam busi-
ness. The Freetrade disease and the low-
tariff disease and the importing and borrow-
ing disease have got this country down, as
all good Protectionists have foretold any
time during the last 30 years. The Free-
trade S. M. Herald on May 25 published a
column of guff about “New Industries,”
and stated that “the general public knows
little of the strides that have been made in
manufacturing, and in no State more than in
N. S. Wales, since the war broke out.”
Then it went into details and enumerated
toys and roofing tiles, and spoke in a generul
way about expansion in the manufacture of
bricks, lollies, machinery and a number of
other articles. But it was all very indefinite,
especially the bricks. Compared with the
case of Canada, which is exporting and sell-
ing to the Allies a big surplus of cartridges,
explosives, miscellaneous munitions of war,
manufactured iron and steel goods, gasoline
launches, printing paper and even some
wooden ships, and thereby getting the gold
to meet its foreign liabilities, and is able to
run a compulsory service policy and have a
decent revenue surplus—compared with
Canada the position is pathetic. But the
Canadian manufacturer has a big tariff and
has it now.
The Shark in Sheep’s Clothing.
The Italian celebration is a reminder of
the Prussian’s utter inability to go straight.
When the war began, Italy, even apart from
its unreadiness, was a worried peninsula.
It had an old friendship with France be-
cause France had harried the Austrians out
of Lombardy and Central Italy in 1859, and
had made the Italian kingdom possible. But
France had demanded Savoy by way of pay-
ment, and it had left its work unfinished,
for the Austrians retained Yenetia. Nap.o-
leon 111., the boss hesitator of the century,
could hardly help leaving Venice to the Aus-
trians, for Prussia had served him with notice
to go no farther ; but the taking of Savoy was
not appreciated, and when he also stipu-
lated that Rome must not be included in the
new kingdom Italy felt very cold towards
its shuffling benefactor. Then France
snatched Tunis just when Italy was about
to take it, and the boot-shaped country
boiled over. On the other hand Prussia,
which threatened war on France in 1859 if
it took Venetia from Austria and gave it to
Italy, did exactly that same deed itself in
1866. Thereby it proved, at no cost what-
ever, that Codlist was the friend, not Short.
Italy was intensely grateful to Prussia and
fed out of its hand. In 1870 Prussia, which
was just becoming the German Empire,
made it possible, by its war with France, for
Italy to annex Rome, and Italy would have
gladly lent the big friend its boots on de-
mand. German capital poured in to benefit
Italv. It poured in so fast that by 1914 a
multitude of banks bearing Italian names
were really German; ditto ninety per cent,
of the water power used for manufacturing;
ditto a multitude of factories (including
munition factories), ships (half the alleged
Italian steam shipping was Hun in reality),
newspapers, insurance companies, trading
companies, shipbuilding companies, -land
companies and sundries. During the long
rule of Premier Giolitti the Hun even
bought up or “influenced” a majority of the
Italian Parliament. The long, thin country
still admired its big Hun friend, but began
to wish that he wouldn’t live quite so per-
manently on the premises. For the Aus-
trian, though nominally an ally, there was
hate unspeakable. He had trodden on, in-
sulted, plundered and brutalised Italy for
centuries; he still held bits of the old
Venetian republic; and he had under his
domination nearly 1,000,000 Italians whom
he Germanised with all the mean, hard de-
vices of his nature. When the Russians
were tramping into Austria, Francis
Joseph tried to buy off Italian hostility.
Like Pharaoh, he would let the people go.
Then the battered Russian began to tramp
back, and F. Joseph hardened his heart.
Like Pharaoh, he wouldn’t let the people
go. So Italy declared war —bloody and re-
lentless war —upon the old monster; on the
Turk, who is also an enemy of ancient date,
and on his satellite Bulgaria. But it dis-
liked to biff its old friend Prussia, so it
was in the anomalous position of fighting
three members of the Hun alliance, and
taking friendly drinks and ham sandwiches
with the fourth. And things might have
continued like this, to the serious crippling
of the Franco-British alliance, only the
Prussian couldn’t keep honest even when paid
to do so. The Prussian friend began to
supply munitions to the Austrian enemy to
use against the Italian friend; in fact,
hundreds of the up-to-date guns which the
Italians captured during their early suc-
cesses were of Prussian manufacture. Then
it was found that food, sent from Italy via
Switzerland to Germany, was diverted to
Austria, and the Italians discovered their

Therefore they broke with Germany; ’ but
did it so reluctantly that they agreed not to
confiscate German property in Italy in re-
turn for one small concession. Italian resi-
dents in Kaiser William Land were to be
treated kindly, and those of them who re-
ceived old age or invalid or military or other
pensions were to have their little incomes
regularly. The amount involved was only about
£200,000 a year. Still the Prussian couldn’t
keep straight. He stopped the pensions and
kicked the ex-recipients hard. Whereupon
the Italian Government laid hands on
£150.000,000 worth of German property and
is still hunting for more property of the
same sort which is lying low in disguise. As
a wolf in sheep’s clothing the Prussian fails
for exactly the same reason which makes a
shark a poor diplomatist. There is too much
wolf and not enough sheep’s clothing.
The Rolling Tide of Invasion.
Speculation as to the Germans’ objective in
the current unpleasantness is rather futile.
From their point of view what better objec-
tive could they have than a sector lightly
held by the Allies? And what more could
they want to do than fall upon this sector
in large numbers and advance farther into
the country they are attacking? Their ob-
jective all the time must be to hurt their
enemies, and in this case if they have not
injured them to the extent of actual defeat
they have delivered a very unpleasant blow.
There can be little if any doubt that Luden-
dorff caught Foch where a drive was not
expected, and did it, too, under circum-
stances which left the Generalissimo guess-
ing whether the assault was genuine or an
attempt to draw him away from somewhere
else. For a week the German advance
towards the Marne was rapid. By the end
of that time he had established a new line,
on which he was facing westward from the
river at Chateau Thierry to Noyon, had
captured Soissons, and on the eastern face of
the salient was busy encircling Rheirns.
Then either the defence grew stiffer or trans-
port difficulties impeded the German, for by
Monday the French troops were said to be
holding the tide back. But there was great
uncertainty about it all, ns the battle was
still going on with great violence. Any
substantial advance by the enemy on this
Noyon to the Marne front would have the
tragic result of bringing Paris within range
of continual bombardment, and nobody can
now doubt the Hun’s readiness to put more
Fat Berthas into action if he gets anything
like an opening. The position at the beginning
of the week was, then, far from cheerful, yet
it was much less dismal than it had been
:i few' days earlier. Meanwhile the news
that submarines are active off the coast of
the United States throws a further dark
shadow on the confident allegations made
by Lloyd George a couple of weeks ago.
Whenever the little man becomes optimistic
about the submarine or anything else the
events of the next day or so are more or
less calamitous. His facts have an extra-
ordinary facility for merging 'into fiction,
especially in relation to submarines and
shipbuilding. Plainly the' submarine is not
beaten yet, and serious trouble from the
torpedo in the Atlantic is something which
will just now worry the Allies more than
almost anything else.
The president of the Australian Labor party
has assured the Australian Labor Confer-
ence and Australia in general that the last
great strike was a “scheme” devised by the
N. S. Wales Government, and a “trap” laid
by it for the unions. This is the regular
assurance nowadays, and if there is any
truth in it the union leaders’ eyesight must
be very poor, or their intelligence very simple.
In N. S. Wales alone they walked into 294
separate traps, or into the same old trap 294
times, during 3917, which made a steady
average of one trap and a fraction for every
working day. People so simple-minded or
so short-sighted don’t seem fit to be en-
trusted w'ith large public affairs, or small
ones either.
When Studley Hall, in Kew, was bought by
the Vie. Government for «>.se as a V.D. hospi-
tal. the neighboring plutocrats, from the
midst of their airy acres, objected so loudly
that the original purpose was abandoned and
£5600 of State money was stuck firmly in the
mud. The Bulletin suggested at the time
that the spot would make a suitable con-
valescery for soldiers. It was a proposition
that evidently touched somebody in the right
place, for lately Chief Sec. Bowser was
offered the purchase-price of the building by
an anonymous patriot. The one condition
of purchase was that the Federal Govern-
ment should accept the establishment as a
free gift for a soldiers’ rest-home. Bowser
passed the offer along, and was presently
staggered by a refusal. Why? Are local
residents’ objections responsible for this, too?
Isn’t the returned broken soldier good enough
to occupy the same suburb with them? Not
only is that the present implication, but the
refusal of the offer suggests that the Federal
Government agrees with them.
The humors of Webster, P.M.G.: —
Somewhere out on The Edge, 500 miles and more
at the back of Townsville, the local population had
an argument about Parses, whose Freetrade policy in
N. S. Wales helped to make things easy for Ger-
many. Of course there was a bet at the end ; and
to The Bulletin came a steaming-hot urgent wire:
“Was Parkes personally a Freetrader? Reply paid.”
Now The Bulletin doesn’t know what Parkes was
personally. It only knows what he professed to be.
So it replied: “Either a Freetrader or a liar.” But
Webster, who allows messages to go over the
people’s Jines reporting Hughes when he says that
perfectly honest Australian people, whom he wants
in the Ministry with him, are Huns and Bolsheviks
and German spies and traitors—this Webster refused
to send the message which said, as a matter of his-
torical fact, that the ancient politician was a Free-
trader if he told the truth. What Webster would
do if somebody wanted to telegraph the Bible
or make a reference to the late Nero —or Ananias,
for that matter —Heaven only knows; hut, after
thinking over the matter for 24 hours, his Depart-
ment was still unable to bring itself to the point of
allowing a customer to say that an unspecified per-
son was “either a Freetrader or a liar.” In the
circumstances, not wishing to seem discourteous to
its correspondent, The Bulletin substituted another
message: “He said he was a Freetrader. But, remem-
ber, he was also a politician.” And the fool of a
Department swallowed the gibe; and by this time
The Bulletin hopes that The Edge has had its
drinks and calmed down. But there is a more
serious side to this matter. Five years ago no
Postmaster-General or Postmaster-General’s underling
would have dared to do such a thing as this. The
underling—Deputy P.M.G. or otherwise—who imag-
ined that his job was to prevent the public using the
wires to make, for instance, a plain statement of
historical fact, would certainly liave been regarded
as too mentally unbalanced to be retained in the
service. But the military censorship has been respon-
sible for a whole lot of small imitations; and
Webster’s Department has apparently decided to be
one of them. Next we shall have it opening letters
and returning them to the senders on the ground
that they don’t suit its taste in religion or
politics. As was remarked above, Webster has
transmitted without question Hughes's description
of decent Australians —whom he afterwards invited
into the Ministry— ils Huns, Bolsheviks and traitors:
so it seeins to come to this: if you are a political
friend of Mr. Webster’s, the telegraphs are very
wide open to you. If you are not, then Mr. Webster

“G.F.”: This ad. clipped from S. M.
Herald makes me sit up and stare; —
FIREWOOD IMPORTED FROM AMERICA.
Owing to the great shortage in Sydney of Soft
Wood Timber, suitable for Kindling Wood, Messrs.
& i f Fuel Merchants, have for some time
found it almost impossible to procure sufficient for
their Sydney trade requirements. They have, how-
ever, now purchased a Cargo of Pine from America,
and wish to notify their customers that there will be
now no difficulty in obtaining it, as the stocks are
sufficient to carry on well into next year,’ and of
superior quality to anything yet procurable.
In my district (I’m on the Coonabarabran
line) hundreds of thousands of pine
are being burnt by settlers as utterly useless.
Yet Australia allows firewood importers to
monopolise precious shipping space bringing
pine kindling from oversea. And they say
that our shipping services are “organised” !

“Ruraiijh O’Conor” : “Plain Austra-
lian’s” statement (B. 30/5/’18) that Irish
history differs from other history may be
true if the “other history” is that written
by Englishmen about Ireland; but, even on
English authority, the amazing statement
that there w T as "no Norman conquest of
Ireland is something of a staggerer to anyone
who has any knowledge at all of the subject.
If there was no Norman conquest, how is it
that so many princes of Norman name w’ere
ruling almost as independent sovereigns to
the most remote parts of the island by the
time of Henry VIII.? The Du Bourgs
( Bourkes ) ruled in Galway; the Fitz-
geralds were masters of Kerry; the I)e
Courcys’ castles in Ulster were already fall-
ing into ruin. Surely they are rather sub-
stantial proof of a Norman invasion, these
foreign names in all corners of the kingdom.
But English historians do not deny the fact,
as “Straight Australian” would have us
crookedly believe. Here is Froude’s state-
ment: “When the wave of Norman invasion
rolled across St. George’s Channel, the suc-
cess was as easy and appeared as complete as
William’s conquest of the Saxon.” Or take
the word of Thierry, the French historian:
“The conquest of Ireland by the Anglo-
Normans is, perhaps, the only one that has
not been followed by a gradual amelioration
of the condition of the conquered people.” So
“other history,” as represented by both a
brilliant Englishman and a still more bril-
liant Frenchman, is against “Devious Aus-
tralian” in the only matter he cites.
Readers of his easy condemnation of Irish
aspirations can gauge the value of his
opinions by his recklessness in regard to
matters of fact.
This is the official report of the Australian
Government’s shipping: —
Ships bought in England, 13. (There were la, but
the Huns got two.)
Ships interned here, 20.
Ships building in the United States, 14.
Ships to be built in Australia, 30.
Ships under consideration in Australia, 10.
Ships built in Australia, none.
And the Sydney Telegraph headed it “Fleet
of 87 Vessels.”
A first-class engineer was wasted when
John Pattinson was lately killed in France.
He was an Adelaide School of Mines boy,
who, after putting in some years with a
mineral-exploration co. in Papua, was with
the Broken Hill Prop, when the war broke
out. He was one of the first into khaki in
his native State.
Zinc shavings for cyaniding are another
instance of the wicked waste of trying to
make things in Australia. Before the war
German zinc-makers used to simply the
goods to Australia at a nominal charge of
£93 a ton. Now, though warned that of
course the scheme must fail, a Perth co. has
the industry well established and is turning
out the shavings at £75 a ton. The mill not
only supplies W.A. but exports to M.L. and
South Africa. The stories about the tre-
mendous technical difficulties in the way
were all moonshine.
While he fixes and unfixes prices, Federal
Commissioner Whitton’s real job seems to
be to keep a team of “inquiries” running
abreast, so that people won’t worry the Fed-
eral Ministry. To help him with these re-
searches he has brought over to Melbourne
George Martin, who has for a good while
been the Commissioner for holding down as
many of the Speck’s prices as he could
roach up to. George Martin grew apples at
New Norfolk and worked so' well for Labor
that it put him into the State Parliament.
There he did good work as chairman of the
Public Works Committee; but Labor voters
dropped him for W. E. Shoobridge, who
could talk twice as long and 11 times as fast.
Osborne, the second-youngest son of
strenuous old Adye Douglas, a patriarch
among the patriarchs who were sent over
from Tasmania to help frame the Australian
Constitution, has made his last appearance
at the Bar. A barrister and solicitor at
Nhill (Vic.), Osborne Douglas accepted at
35 a brief in the case (part heard) of
Kaiser v. Civilisation, and was killed in
France on April 24. Educated at Hobart
Uni., he was admitted to the Vic. Bar in
1907. Under him the Nhill Football Club
won the West Wimmera premiership in
1912, and he had played with Tasmania in
inter-State and international cricket. He
was wearing a corporal’s stripes when the
end Came.
A case for inquiry:—
The public, having read (and by now forgotten)
the reports on llandwick Military Hospital, doubt-
less imagines that everything is well there.
But another Commission is needed to find out if the
deficiencies and faults pointed out previously have
been remedied, and if not, why not? The building,
condemned as unsuitable, remains unsuitable. There
is no provision for artificial heating in the wards.
The supply of table appointments is deficient. There
are not enough orderlies, and of those who are there
many are not A.M.C. men at all, but members of
the Sea Transport Battalion—men who joined up
for service on transports, being unfit for active
service. Whoever sent them to care for sick and
wounded only made fools of men who were trying
to do their bit at their own game and inflicted
unnecessary hardship on the patients. And some-
one really ought to inquire into the matter of dis-
cipline.
“Pallida” : In Melbourne District Court on
May 28 William Westbury, chemist, of 365
Swanston-street. was charged with having,
not being a medical practitioner nor acting
under a medical practitioner’s instructions,
supplied medicine to a person suffering from
venereal disease. The person was a returned
soldier who had heard Westbury addressing
the crowd on Yarra Bank. Next night, it
was sworn, he visited Westbury’s shop with
a plain-clothes constable, who remained out-
. side. Westbury supplied the ex-soldier with
a bottle of “mixture,” for which 10s. was
paid, and said that a cure would cost £6.
Medical evidence showed that the stuff might
cure bronchitis, but it was, said the magis-
trate (Cohen, P.M.), “absolutely useless for
the purpose for which it was obtained.”
Though the Bench had power to order cold
hard gaol, it contented itself with a fine of
£l5, with £G 3s. Od. costs. Said the P.M.:
Medical men are under an obligation to report
every venereal case they treat. The Act specifically
prevents chemists from treating cases, because there
can be no control over their actions. The defendant
in this case got his custom by advertising himself on
the Yarra Bank, and he not only treated this man
contrary to the Act, but gave him medicine which
was absolutely useless for the purpose for which it
was obtained. It is almost a ease of imposition.
How narrow a margin separates “almost”
from “quite” the Bench didn’t say. But
the decision should throw a healthy bomb
into the Yarra Bank school of medicine.

“General Post,” produced at Melbourne
Royal last Saturday, takes its title from a
familiar parlor game, and amounts to a
serib-farcical comedy, played mainly by five
people in one room. It might just as well
be called "The Lass Who Loves a Tailor.”
Her father, a hearty, intolerant English
baronet; her tender-hearted Tory mother ;
and her unpleasant cub of a brother—all
three are appalled at her infatuation for a
brainy tailor who has taken to Territorial
soldiering because he scents the Hun menace.
This tailor is cast in the same mould as the
amateur soldier-hero in “An Englishman's
Home.” His wisdom controls his inclinations
when the outspoken .damsel proposes to
marry him. He has no reverence for social
caste, but he admits its power in the land ;
so the Baronet’s daughter considers herself
snubbed when he tells her that no clever
tailor can hope to achieve domestic happi-
ness by annexing the daughter of his very
best customer. And the snub rankles in her
ardent bosom. The baronet, of course,
esteems the other for closing his mouth
against the beauteous plum which would
fain fall into it, but laughs at his distrust of
the good, kind Germans and his enthusiasm
for Territorial soldier duty. This is three
years before the war breaks out.
* * * *
Act 2 finds the baronet a Home-defence
warrior, struggling with the rudiments of
drill and discipline, while his son is con-
verted into a bright subaltern, devoted to his
Colonel —who is Smith, the tailor aforesaid.
When the young soldier comes home on his
final leave he brings the Colonel with' him.
The Bart, pays clumsy respect to the man
who used to cut his pauts, the heroine twits
her father and brother on their new-born
appreciation of her former idol, and poor
Lady Broughton is shocked at the very
thought of her boy being subordinate to the
family snip. The humor of the situation is
strengthened by the introduction of the
Colonel’s apologetic brother, who is carry-
ing on the business. In Act 3. when the war
is supposed to have ended, Smith has ex-
panded into a brigadier-general with an
official future. The Baronet and his son now
hope' he will marry into their ancient family,
whereas the fond, unflinching mother merely
consents against her will to the inevitable
outrage on caste. She would like to think a
distinguished brigadier-tailor fit to marry a
daughter of hers, but she can’t. She weeps
over the fact that pride in blue blood was
born in her bones. The girl, having soothed
her wounded feelings by saying “No” to the
warrior, lures him into the garden to hear
her trembling “Yes,” whereupon an observ-
ant butler touches the dinner-gong gently.
The comedy, full of commonplace dia-
logue and void of dramatic sensation, gives
good acting opportunities to all five princi-
pals. If the story seems dull and weak at
times, it is generally because the performance
needs to be better. Stvan, as the jolly old ass
who declared a war to be impossible, and then
claims to have always predicted it, gets the
easiest part. He presents the right type of
person, but is .over-emphatic and disposed to
exaggerate the Baronet’s conventional ab-
surdities. Miss Morrison, on the other hand,
is a trifle too cold and mechanical as the
speech-making mother; and Roger Barry, as
the son, makes a more convincing cub in
the first act than a warm-hearted soldier
afterwards. There is something namby-
pambyish in his effusive regard for his
Colonel. Also the Colonel (Graham Browne)
is only sometimes convincing in a very diffi-
cult part. A subtle artist in his picture of
the discreet tailor, his style is not too
effeminate when he appears again as a
colonel. But the horrors of war have left
no traces on his subsequent personality, and
a falsetto note in bis love-making doesn’t
suggest a stroug man thrilling with emotion.
Of Miss Lizette Parkes, as the self-willed
charmer turned cynical by force of circum-
stances, one may say that this performance
is her best up to date. When she tones down
her affectations in diction it will be even
better.

dizzily till it's time to pull up in the last act.
* * •* *
Greene gets the best acting chance he has
had yet, and the songs he has don’t seem to
hurt him. (He used to strain his voice pain-
fully in “Buck Up” in “You’re in Love.”)
Also, in a balcony burlesque with Maude
Fane he dances without any suggestion of
creakiness. Maude, brilliantly costumed and
in good voice, has a full hand of catchy
songs which are done artfully, with the
skilled help of the J.C.W. choristers, whose
work in this production is ***. Field Fisher
harks and snarls as the dyspeptic bulldog;
hut the dramatist has him on a short allow-
ance of bones. Frith as the pottering asylum
doctor is luckier and has one of the most
humorous songs that have strayed into a
featherweight show for a long time. “I’m
a Specialist” and the opening chorus that
precedes it are well up in the comic-opera
class. The co. gets every ounce out of both
numbers. Connie Ediss as the asylum
patient’s weeping wife flings herself about
in hopeless grief when the wrong man (it
always has to be the wrong man) refuses
to own her or the two children. It’s a
monotonous job and Cecil Bradley, who plays
opposite her, has another hard row to hoe as
a constant giggler. Madge Elliott and Jack
Hooker do a tango that rouses the house,
and Hooker. Tom Preston and little Rita
Nugent dance a trio that brings it down.
Leslie Board provides two bright scenic set-
tings, the dancing is to Minnie Everett’s
credit and producer Harry Burcher can eat
a first-night laurel wreath, leaf by leaf, if
tucker gets short.

“Carmelita,” the Melbourne Palace’s
“comic opera of Sunny Spain,” has un-
accountably travelled to Mexico since the
advt. appeared, but has suffered no damage
on the voyage. Rather it has gained in
recklessness of conduct and h {is wf>n tolera-
tion for a lot of extravagances that would
have aroused wonder in a more settled civil-
isation. As it is, the piece goes to the
limits of credibility by producing a bandit
who lightens the pockets of the wealthy with
the help of a female booty-chorus, and even
pauses under the eye of outraged Authority
to dally with a publican’s daughter. Also
there is a scarecrow aidykong of a Yankee
pill-magnate who endeavors to pose as the
cut-throat Romeo; but public gullibility,
already shocked by the female- bandits, is
comparatively undisturbed by this phenom-
enon. The giggly story runs for two and a
half hours with an inexhaustible flow of
music and patter from the pens of Fred
Whaite and Victor Prince. Whaite effec-
tively conducts his own score, whilst Prince,
in the ruddy guise of the aforesaid quack,
bubbles with a fat and stertorous glee. His
foreman. Jazzbo, reveals Con Moreni in a
phase of eccentric humor for which he has
all the necessary credentials. The character
is an emaciated member of the gazeka family
that looks like an ornamental hatpin in pro-
file, but Moreni manages to restore its
humanity by investing it with a large and
perilous thirst. George Whitehead sings
l*artily as the bandit chief and Maudie
Miles’s soprano fills Carmelita’s musical
moments with glamorous sound. Clifford
O’Keefe, as the President, warbles as will-
ingly as his stage sister (Dorothy blast-
ings), whose vocal and physical virtues.
afford gratification to ear and eye. Also
the lady banditti fill their tights with sump-
tuous charms.

Muriel Starr has come back to Sydney
Criterion to show “The Easiest Way.” There
is a moral about this slick American dramma,
no doubt; the trouble is to find it. Still the
theory is simple enough—that a woman who
has become accustomed to selling her body
for gorgeous clothes and expensive food will
ever afterwards find it easier to go on doing
it than take a job washing dishes pending
matrimony. Though of course not a theory
capable of universal application, it goes close
to the bull’s-eye—given the particular type
of female. But even to her the easiest road
is the hardest that feet may follow to Hell,
or anywhere else.
* * * *
Out of Laura Murdock, the lady in the
case; Willard Brockton, who provides the
funds; John Madison, who attracts the
lady’s affections and generates a 100-h.p.
determination to marry her, and a cynical,
vulgar member of the most ancient profes-
sion, Eugene Waller has made a play that
slips easily along to an appropriate anti-
climax. The men are wowsers. Brockton’s
wild spasms of indignation on discovering
that Laura had not imparted to Madison the
facts about her second sinful interlude are
obvious exercises in' cant, and Madison’s
sudden descent from the plane of decent man-
hood to unfathomable priggishness makes for
gaiety rather than tragedy. Neither of these
men continue to be quite human after half-
way, nor does the obliging Laura get even
half a chance of explaining why, since she
disliked being “lost” and did not want to be
mislaid any more, she dodged going to work
and wandered cheerfully off among the prim-
roses’. The only real person is Laura’s
fellow-practitioner at living in the easiest
way. She does it
brazenly, is wise
in a foolish fashion,
and says “M y
Gawd” with gen-
uine feelings of as-
tonishment. Norma
Mitchell makes
this pleasantly un-
desirable person
something for which
the covetousness of
the ancient mil-
lionaire who pays
the rent can be ex-
cused. Muriel Starr
has done better
things than Laura
—and worse. It
is a hard part to
play, too mercurial
for her sometimes,
and at others too
drab. But she does
well.

The music and the company are occasionally
noticeable, but the revue is a loose Collection
of jokes and dances which only varies its
monotony when Paul or his accomplice sits
down hard on the stage. There are, for all
that, bright spots—notably the fine singing
of the Grafters’ Quartette. In the first part
are a couple of new balancers, the Harlems,
while McLean and Lee have broken out in
a fresh sketch, “Ootsey,” which is equal in
hilarity to the previous piece, though ifc
doesn’t derive all its momentum from Beer.

Bert Bailey ended a successful season at
Adelaide Royal with his Scotch study of
“Duncan McClure.” As usual, Fred McDon-
ald was his strongest support, but it is a
good co. all round. Duggan for once had to
be villain, and Grace Doran showed for a
moment a sense of humor; but that is a thing
Steele Rudd does not allow to his heroines,
and it faded out after the first act into the
usual troubled expression. Grant is now
steering Bailey and co. round the country
towns of S. Aus. on the way to Broken Hill.
The Tivoli has dropped into the most lurid
type of London-made melodrama, mostly
about an express train. But trains can now
be so faithfully represented in film drama
that even the best work of the stage-car-
penter does not look convincing. The Majes-
tic bill has been mostly song and patter, both
first-class of their kind. The man of the
Gilbert pair, and the more active of the
Shattuck-O’Neill combination, are both fine
natural comedians. The writer had the bad
luck to strike Fred Bluett in a bunch of poor
songs, but they show him artist enough to
get a lot out of the moderate material. The
most striking thing in pictures is the dis-
appearance of “The Garden of Allah” from
West’s programme. This story of a monk
who broke his vows was well received, and
was then taken off, as the management adver-
tises mysteriously, “in the best interests of
our patrons.” Wondergraph’s pictures of
Australian soldiers in Europe are unusually
clear, and score accordingly.

A Vic. Artists’ Show: —
There is nothing original, forceful or daring in
the annual drawing-room of the Vic. Artists in Mel-
bourne. Only Norman Macgeorge could be quite
safely fined tuppence for conduct unbecoming the
local tradition. His gleaming sketches, “Fruits of
the Earth” and “Late Afternoon,” would be almost
stentorian if the noise were not limited by the small
size of the canvas. Miss H. Irvine, though le^s
colorful, is also reasonably independent. Her three
portrait sketches evidently derive their odd enthu-
siasm from a French education.

scale running from sage green in the bass
to canary yellow in alt, and works it into
a triviality that affects one like the tinkle
of a toy piano. W. B. Mcinnes’s’ big “Blue and
Gold” is an accurate transcription of facts that gives
a poetic pleasure, though his fondness for bird’s-eye
views is narrowing the scope of his art. Delafield
Cook’s largest canvas, “Lingering Mists,” is the repe-
tition of a manner which insists on a palette of grey
and green as the basis for every achievement. W. N.
Anderson’s “Evening, Mentone,” shows a ti-tree fore-
ground writhing against the sunset, while F. G. Rey-
nolds’s “Golden Afternoon, Glen Iris,” skimps the
gold and spares the afternoon, but makes an agree-
able decoration. Reynolds also contributes a por-
trait of etcher Shirlow which is notable for the elec-
tric itensity of the high lights beating upon the
artist’s face. W. D. Knox is a new. landscapist who
has something fresh to say. R. McCann’s bit of
seaside is merely a dull arrangement of earth, air
and water. Miss Asquith Baker’s “Summer Morn-
ing” is a minor shout in Prussian blue. Arnold
Shore’s still life, “Chrysanthemum,” is marked by
distinctive treatment.

Among the larger portraitists, I-larry B. Harrison
has a soundly-painted Nurse and a view of a lady
dressed in some brown, shimmery substance which a
mere man can only call itiucilage de sole. In
“Self Portrait” Leslie Wilkie treats himself like an
Old Master. He also bails up the eye with a
depressed damsel wrapped in a vociferous lavender
cape. May, Allen displays an excellent profile por-
trait of pianist Goll, and Violet Teague heads a
throng Of old-age pensioners. T. V. Carter’s “Mock
Offering,” with a lady bent before a statue which
might be Chidley, is weak in pictorial balance and
conception. Miss Hurry’s painful “Life Class Model”
calls for forgiveness; Miss Bale’s “Reader” is effec-
tive in facial expression; and Miss Perry’s “News
from the Front” is an amateurish example of un-
inspired genre painting. Miss Roxburgh's “Mail
Day” is similar in subject, but the figures and even
the furniture are obviously posed. In his two or
three portraits C. Bowman Fletcher uses his art as an
adze to rough-hew whom he will. Dora Wilson
pastels a nice girl's nude back; Shirlow etches with
all his romantic truthfulness as usual; and minia-
turist Miss Edwell is well represented.

“Florida” : Prompted by the fact that certain
foolish knitters had been hurting the feelings of
hard-fighting Billjim in Palestine by sending
packages through the Red Cross with such
messages as “I hope no cold-footer in Egypt
gets this,” the heads have been searching the
packages before they are despatched. Dear
old ladies have been on this job. They have
had some surprises. One dear old thing in
our comforts club dived her aristocratic hand
into a suit of pyjamas and pulled out the
following, written on blush notepaper:—
O soldier, dear soldier, in France or in Blighty,
I would these pyjamas were at home like my nighty.
But it is hard to get a rhyme with
“Blighty”; and when you’ve finished the first
line with it—well, what could the poor girl
do?
NATURE LEARNED IT FIRST.
THE MISS: “Oh, the poor little caterpillar!
How can you kill the pretty thing?
See how beautifully it is marked!”
THE GARDENER: “Bah! All camouflage!”
“Bacon Stealer” : There is a place called
Burramine in the north-east of Victoria
which hasn’t been notorious for hopping into
khaki. A returned Billjim on a visit to the
district met a few of the local inhabitants in
the village pub. Of course they asked him to
relate some of his experiences at the Front.
The soldier thought for a few moments and
then handed out the following: “Well, once
we were holding the front line at Armen-
tieres, and the German trenches were within
speaking distance. When things got quiet
we used to have a yarn with Fritz. One day
he was skiting about what his aeroplanes
were doing in reconnaissance work. He said
he knew more about us than we knew about
ourselves. ‘Why,’ he says, ‘we can tell you
what you got and what you ain’t got.’ ‘What
ain’t we got?’ says one of our smarties,
hoping for valuable information. ‘You ain’t
got a man from Burramine,’ says Fritzie.”
Billjim stopped suddenly. The inhabitants
arose and departed in silence.
“Windgauge”: The Billjim hat originated
in Queensland. Colonel Ricardo found that
a turn-up on the left side gave good shade
to the riflemen’s right eye, with consequent
improvement in sighting, and the necessary
regulation was issued. Soon N. S. Wales
recognised the improved smartness and
devil-may-care effect, but did not grasp the
reason. Therefore, to be free from any
risk of being mistaken for the wild men of
the North, the warrior of the Mother State
was ordered to fasten up his wargoing lid
on the right side.

The wail of a stricken soul: —•
“Bullamacow” is nigger for tinned beef, and the
troops in this fever-smitten group (New Britain)
have passed upon it the curse eternal. We swallow
bullamacow, we dream it. The ruddy labels haunt
us. We see it, hear it, smell it, feel it, look it.
It springs upon us disguised as hashed ox, curried
ox, roast beef, sirloin of ox; ox boiled, baked, fried,
poached, scrambled, soused, scorched and turtled.
It ambushes us as fricassee and compote of ox, as
bubbleandsqueak and rissoles ; it descends upon us as
sea-pie and land-pie, and it is extremely prevalent in
soup. We resume its acquaintance as sausage, and
it becomes intimate as minced veal, and h;fc even been
discovered masquerading as fish-balls. But disguise
is useless—under any of its 785 aliases it is irre-
trievably and incontestably “bullem.” Lord, answer
this our prayer: Give us this day some steak and
onions and a pint of stout!

“Fitzwilliam”: The gentle art of camou-
flage is not confined to the combatant
branches of the Defence Department. A
client of mine, a newspaper proprietor, had
an account of some £3O against the Depart-
ment for advts. in connection with the con-
scription round-up in October and Novem-
ber, 1916. On the completion of the work
he submitted the usual departmental voucher,
duly certified by the responsible officer, and
accompanied by cuttings of the newspapers
containing the advts. On February 26,
1918, being tired of waiting, he put the
claim into my hands. The District Pay-
master, on being threatened, retired modestly
behind the statement that it was difficult
to verify a claim submitted so long after the
work was done. I countered with a copy of
the voucher and the necessary clippings, and
pointed out that 17 months ought to be
quite sufficient time to verify one voucher.
I wrote again on the 4th, 12th and 17th
April, urging expedition, and on the 20th
May sent a final notice that unless the claim
was paid within seven days I would com-
mence legal proceedings. In reply I re-
ceived the following:—
Sir, —iRe W. E. M. M . With reference to your
letter of the 20th inst., relative to the abovenamed,
I have to inform you that there is no record of your
letter of the 17th ultimo having been received at this
office, and would therefore request you to be good
enough to repeat same. I would also ask you to
furnish me with full particulars of the soldier as to
name, number and the unit to which he is attached,
as I am unable to identify him in the records of this
office without this information.—Yours faithfully,
W. 0. Jasper, for District Paymaster, 2nd Military
District.
By the same mail I received a letter from
the same office, signed by somebody else,
‘‘Lieut. Colonel, District Paymaster,” stat-
ing that the account had been passed, and
was available for payment at the local post-
office. What I want to know is, was the
letter signed by Mr. Jasper a joke, or an
attempt to cloud the issue, or plain unboiled
foolishness? On the other hand, it may be
simply an instance of the new business
methods recently introduced into the Pay
Office. In any case, it is too subtle for me.
P.S.—The money arrived this morning.

“C.” : Joe was one of the quiet bush type
and one of the best drivers the battery
possessed. He travelled through life on two
phrases. If he disapproved he would say,
“Oh, go to Moses!” If he approved he
would interject, “Yes, that’s right!” One
day when he was plodding along on his
job a shrapnel-shell burst directly overhead
and the blast threw him down. He wasn’t
wounded, as shrapnel always sprays the bul-
lets round, so he soon scrambled to his feet.
Then he looked in the direction where the
shower had fallen, nodded, and remarked:
“Yes, that’s right!”

“Gleniris”: With pain in his voice Dr.
Robertson, of the Vic. Board of Health, has
again remarked on the extraordinary in-
crease of diphtheria throughout the State.
Injection of anti-toxin has immensely re-
duced the proportion of deaths, but that isn’t
everything. Strange to say, the ultimate
tendency of the treatment is to spread the
disease. The serum deals with the germ’s
effects, not with the germ itself. Hence, when
Little Annie makes a good recovery, too fre-
quently she is sent back to school before a
thorough clearance of the germs has been
effected ; and she therefore acts as a carrier.
Isolation of the whole family, including the
cat, is the suggested remedy, and, hanging to
that, the sound proposition that the State
should provide for the isolated parties, where
necessary, while the germs are being dealt
with. Still, though these suggestions and
outcries and newspaper agitations are all
very excellent, why can’t somebody in autho-
rity get up and do something and do it now?'
It will come cheaper in the end.
IN HER MAIDEN CAMPAIGN.
“Did you say this ring's a war relic, Malel?”
“Yes. I won it in my first engagement."
“McNorth”: At Somerset, Cape York,
there is only one house, and the nearest
neighbors reside at a 12-mile-away telegraph
station. The rest is jungle, hills, beaches,
solitudes. But the empty North is getting
a look in at last. A recent Gazette notifies
the appointment of “W. D. Howe to be
keeper of the gaol at Somerset, Cape York.”
The fact that there is no gaol there doesn’t
matter, because there is nobody to lock up,
unless, of course, Mr. Howe brings a few
lawbreakers with him to give the new indus-
try a start.

Perhaps it is the war; something, cer-
tainly is making even the oldest Judges
more human, and you would expect them to
alter their ways with most difficulty. For
example, when a Melbourne, chemist named
Daintree (54) explained that he had married
A POSSIBILITY.
THE MAN: “I can do the turkey trot, the
bunny hug, and”
THE GIRL: “Yes, and I shouldn’t be sur-
prised if you don’t have to learn the
goose step some day.”
his wife eight years ago because she threat-
- ened to shoot him if he didn’t, Justice Hodges
listened courteously; and when he further
told how she refused to hold conversation
with him, insulted him before customers
and broke plates and pot-sticks over him,
his Honor opined that constructive desertion
had been proved, and granted surcease from
Mrs. Daintree, the petitioner to pay her £2
a week for life or until she marries again.
The lady has had poor matrimonial luck, her
first husband having “died young” and her
secpnd four days after the wedding; and
now, at 48, she is again unattached. Still,
Daintree is no prize-winner; £lOO a year is
a fair sum to pay for his comfort.

“Squadrilla”: They are cheery birds, these
Boomerang Boys who ricochet from front to
front. One young lahce-jack, Norman Rams-
den, of the Signallers, writes to explain that
in Blighty he was asked to give displays of
boomerang-throwing and black-tracking, but
begged off because he had left his music at
home. He and his cobber met lan Hamilton
in Hyde Park. He greeted them like a man
and a brother, and they were guests at his
garden party. On their way home they met
a motor whose cargo looked like duchesses.
“We gave them the glad eye in a respectful
sort of way,” says the tactful corporal, “and
asked them to take tea with us.” The
duchesses did, and after a meal whose
swankiness would have subdued anything but
a Billjim, insisted on paying for it. Then
France —and he talks to the natives. But
“the war must have upset the French people
a great deal when they can’t recognise their
own tongue.” he comments: and concludes
with an S.O.S. call for 10 quids’ worth of
Aussie sunshine—as if his own heart wasn’t
full of it!

In those bright years, now what a world away,
When sleep untroubled closed each tranquil day,
Peace dwelt at home, Plenty in barn and vat;
Daily my glad heart sang Magnificat.
Now, in the darkness of these later days
For lives beloved laid down, with tears and praise
My heart still sings (since hearts must sing or die—
E'en yet, in France, the lark’s note thrills the sky),
And daily pays its tribute unto them ;
Magnificat no more, but Requiem!

“Randolph” : Not the strangest thing about
the war is the new crop of prophets, inter-
preters, fortune-tellers, crystal-gazers, witch-
doctors and ju-ju men. The prophets and
interpreters mostly content themselves with
the obvious remark that the war is the worst
Armageddon as ever was, and can tell you
about the battle of the Marne any time
after it happened, just as the outhouse tip-
ster can write the winners of the Melbourne
Oup two days after the Oaks. _ There are two
parsons now lecturing in Brisbane, and they
are exaggerations of the common type that
proves Habbakuk by the Revelation and
explains Leviticus with the Lamentations of
Jeremiah, deceased. They are out to prove
that the English are the lost Ten Tribes.
Futility couldn’t go farther. Who wants
to find millions of new Jews? And the
millions don’t want to be found if discovery
means repatriation, because Jerusalem was
never so comfortable as the Stock Exchange
or Tattersall’s after a skinner. One of the
parsons is, however, straining a credulous
public’s credulity in the attempt to prove
that London is Tarshish, and that some Old
Testament remark about “flying like doves
to their windows” means British aeroplanes
returning to their hangars. Simple souls
without humor. Yet I suppose the living is
fairly good and it is certainly easy.

on the following :

“Bolwarrah”: “Teller's” remarks (B.
23/5/’18) anent the Australian note currency
will appeal to all cashiers who have to
handle the paper. I, one of the poor devils
who have to pass it back and forward all
day, can quote cases of tellers suffering
from skin diseases reasonably believed to
have been contracted from the handling of
dirty notes. “Teller,” however, seems to
assume that the Commonwealth Treasury,
IMPLICITY.
“What did he make his money out of?"
“The simplest little thing in the world."
“The brute! Who was she?"
which controls the issue of the notes, has
done little or nothing towards keeping the
issue clean. As a matter of fact, until the
big fight interfered with the supply of the
special paper used, the Commonwealth
Bank, as agent for the Treasury, was set-
ting a high standard by cancelling all dirty
and worn notes received and issuing only
new, or “as good as new,” in exchange. Even
now, when the paper trouble is acute, the
number of “pieces” cancelled weekly in Syd-
ney alone often runs well into six figures. It
seems inevitable that the Commonwealth
Bank will eventually take over the whole of
the Commonwealth note issue, and, if so, a
considerable improvement will be made by
the substitution of a better class of paper.
After many years’ experience I am satisfied
that the Australian notes in use have not the
average life of most of those previously
issued by the private banks.
AS FAR AS HER CONSCIENCE WOULD
GO.
“ Look , I’d like to spend my money on you
always.”
“Oh, I couldn't dream of letting you do
that! But you can spend it on me as
long as it lasts."
“Umfaan”: Add my experience to that of
“Ereem” (B. 23/5/’18). On our trip home
to Australia, not only were boots found in
the crew’s quarters, but also bedding and
blankets, which the troops would
have had to pay for. And the Old
Man of the packet was not enthusi-
astic over holding a sudden inspec-
tion, either. Prosecutions are dis-
liked by ships’ captains, as they
mean a delay of the ship, the
attendance of ships’ officers and
possibly the losing of hands. But
that’s no reason why Billjim should
have to pay the piper.
* * *
“Stiggins”: Giving evidence be-
fore the Royal Commission on
Beer, Padre White, of Westralia,
not long back from France said he
was in favor of the troops having
beer. Did he not think that it was
ruinous to the efficiency of the
army? No, certainly not; the only
ruined army he knew of was the
Russian, which had prohibited drink.
And no one had ever accused the
German army of being demoralised,
ruined or beerless. Troops in the
course of a long war were apt to
get “fed up” and to brood. “Beer,”
said this astonishing priest, “which
sometimes inebriates, always
cheers.” Further, beer lent itself to
friendly feeling and the knowledge
that one had mates, thus building
un a unit’s esprit de corps. But no
one could accuse cocoa of such an
act. A somewhat Scotch person
asked him if he could say the same
for whisky. The reply was rather
disconcerting. “The country which
is believed to use whisky as a
national beverage is noted for its
lack of hilarity.” Did he think the Cana-
dians were demoralised since prohibition had
been carried?” He had not noticed any signs
of it whtn the rum issue was on.

.“J.G.”: The Vic. Railway panjandrums
are having their newest and biggest locomo-
tive well tried —so much tried that the test
has become a joke among the people along
the North-East line betwen Melbourne and
Seymour (61 miles). For the last two or
three weeks the snorting giant has been
hauling a long train of trucks loaded with
coal to and from Seymour. The coal is
never unloaded, and the daily circus keeps
two train crews going. Scoffing cockies
along the line want to know why the train
pulls the same lot of coal up and down the
country when there are hundreds of thou-
sands of tons of wheat still waiting to be
shifted to the seaboard.
Franklin-square, adjoining the public
buildings in Hobart, has a fine bronze statue
of Sir John Franklin keeping watch over a
fishpond. Time had given it that dull green
so much admired by Art connoisseurs—a
charm that nothing but age can bring. A
late Minister of Lands, who knows more
about bacon and
butter than Art,
thought that Sir
John needed bright-
ening up; so he
called in an out-of-
work amateur deco-
rator. This artist
covered the vener-
able figure with a
bright green var-
nish, undoing in a
few minutes what
it had taken Time
50 years to accom-
plish. As the Mini-
ster stood during
the lunch-hour ad-
miring the result of
his effort, the lady-
pressident of the
local Art Society
happened alo n g,
and after gazing in
amazement for a
few seconds called
for the blood of the
miscreant. She
made straight for
the Minister’s office
with hatred in her
eye and vengeance
in her heart. The
Minister was not
in his office that
day. Nor the next.
The amateur deco-
rator got another
job to remove the
varnish. But the Minister has never since
ventured near the statue.

There is one alien the less in S. Aus.
He was arrested in a Murray town under the
War Precautions Act, and cut his throat in
a cell. His last act was to heap coals of fire
on the head of the S. Aus. Government by
willing to it all his property, contrary to
the advice of his pastor, who naturally
thought the relatives should have it. Doubt-
less they will get it, as the dying man asked
“Can I go now?” after making the sacrifice
—apparently he knew so little of the coun-
try he was living in that he thought he was
purchasing his freedom. But pneumonia,
following on the cut throat, gave it to him
instead.

“J.Q.”: I support “Country Ped.” in his
statements about the satisfactory
progress made by children who
start school two or three years
above the age at which the Edu-
cation Departments ordinarily
compel them to begin. Dozens of
such cases have come under my
notice during a service extending
over 20 years. There is no sane
reason why children should be com-
pelled to begin their education at
six when they can cover the ground
quite easily by beginning at eight
or even nine. Although the age
has been raised to seven in N. S.
Wales people can still send babies
of five or six, and, except the five-
year-olds, the teacher must accept
them. This being so, many people
make a convenience of the school,
relieving themselves of a great bur-
den and conferring it on the teacher.
When I see these little toddlers
trudging miserably from home
these frosty mornings, and when I
realise the extra work thrown on
the teacher who has his school thus
turned into a nursery, I feel like
making the mark of my No. 10 on
the thoughtless parent who sends ’em and
the Minister who allows such a thing.
Brand Whitlock, United States Minister
to Belgium, wrote of his experiences in Brus-
sels two days after the Hun destruction of
Louvain: —■
There was another priest, an old white-haired
ecclesiastic, a scholar and an educator, whom one
addressed as Monseigneur. He was one of those
priests whose liberation I had secured on Thursday
night, and in the morning he came with two others
to thank me. He had left Louvain when the exodus
was ordered on Thursday. He had witnessed the
murder of Father Dupierreux; he had been put into
a filthy cart, as a hostage, and sent into Brussels.
He sat there at my table, a striking figure, the
delicate face dignified and sad, the silver hair, the
long black soutane and the scarlet sash; in his white
hand a well-worn breviary. There were two other
priests—two Jesuit fathers who had come with him,
sitting by in silent sympathy. Monseigneur described
the event. He told it calmly, logically, connectedly,
his trained mind unfolding the events in orderly
sequence; the sound of firing from Herent, the
sudden uprising of German soldiers, the murder, the
lust, the loot, the fires, the pillage, the evacuation
and destruction of the city, and all that. The home
of his father had been burned, and the home of his
brother; his friends and his colleagues had been
murdered before his eyes and their bodies thrown
into a cistern; long lines of his townspeople, con-
fined in the railway station, had been taken out and
shot down; the church of St. Peter’s was destroyed;
the Hotel de Ville, the finest example of late Gothic
extant, was doomed, and the Halles of the Univer-
sity had been consumed; and he told it all
calmly. But there in the Halles of the Uni-
versity was the library; its hundreds of thousands of
volumes, its rare and ancient manuscripts, its unique
collection of books printed before 1500, had all been
burned deliberately, to the last scrap. Monseigneur
had reached this point in his recital; he had begun
to pronounce the word “bibliotheque.” He had said
la biblio” and he stopped suddenly and bit his
quivering l lip. “La bib” —he went on, and then,
spreading his arms on the table before him, he
bowed his head upon them and wept aloud.
And his emotion brought tears to the eyes
of the American man of affairs who lacked
German kultured capacity to see the joke in
a jolly bonfire of 275,000 books and irre-
placeable manuscripts.

As we speed on towards the suburbs where the even-

Life’s a rush to Oblivion—you must grab what
you can get,
And to-night one glimpse of Clubland makes a

No one yells inside those portals "where repose in
pillowed ease
Many rich and lucky beggars who aren’t starting
family trees.
Oh, the home love and the gas bills are the wine of

But to-night I want the silence of that club-house.

IT The medicine that goes hand in hand with good health—a kind of twin brother —that
brings physical confidence, strength, mental energy and clearness, is Clements Tonic,
because it possesses those specific properties that rebuild the human constitution. It
strengthens the working parts, cleanses the stomach, purifies the blood, thus creating new
conditions with good health results to the user. If any greater proof is required of the
powers of this splendid medicine, the testimonies given afford it, written by those
who can well afford by experience to judge of its merits. For the general good of
the public they are published throughout Australia, and are well worth reading.
Over 300 voluntary letters in praise of this nerve remedy have been received in the last few months, which may be seen and verified at the
offices of the Company, Clements Tonic Ltd., Rozelle. Get it from your chemist or store to-day, and get well. Do not wait until to-morrow.

Australia has lost, thi-ough the death of
William I itt, its best-known theati’e archi-
tect. Of portly presence, as befitted an
ex-M.L.C. and a member of the Bent and
Irvine Cabinets, his weight made itself felt
in the chair of the Harbor Trust before that
body was reconstituted. Born in Lonsdale-
street,. Melbourne, in 1555, he was the son
of artist William Pitt of Sunderland. First
prizes were gained by his designs for Mel-
bourne. Coffee Palace, Queen’s Bridge and
St. Kilda Town Hall, but it was as a
theatre architect that he shone. He built
the Princess’s, Royal, King’s, Tivoli, and
Hoyt’s Palais de Luxe in Melbourne; Her
Majesty’s, in Sydney; the Royal, in Adel-
aide; the Wellington Grand Opera House
and others in Maoriland. As a sport he
was for a long while the leading coursing
judge of Vic. and the Ma State, and he was
no mean hand with a gun. And he was
about the best mayor Collingwood ever had.
The nearest Melbourne ever got to grow-
ing its own smokes was through a venture
financed by the late Kong Meng. A tobacco
plantation was
started at the rear
of what is now
State Government
House, and, ran
down to Gardiner’s
Creek. It was a
big acreage, worked
by Chinese under a
Chinese supervisor,
with Kong Meng
footing the bill.
But even in those
days the whole-
salers were too hot
for the producer,
and the industry
was abandoned.
ROBIN S ON.
Attorney-General
of W.A.
Young Alec Little, in the top notch among
Australian-born airmen, the son of a Collins-
street (Melb.) business man, was killed in
France last week. Having a queer craving
for dizzy altitudes, the boy saw no opening
except as an Alpine guide till the call - for
aeronauts sounded. He went to London at
19. qualified at Dad’s expense, and then
joined up with the naval airmen. He first
attracted attention by a courageous rescue
of an aeronaut who, flying a lame machine,
had winged into a precipitous cliff near
Dover. The intrepid lad —he was only 23
at the end—had won practically the possible
in the way of honors, and is said to have
accounted for more Hun machines than any
other Britisher aloft.
Last week the wintry wind began to moan
over the grave of old Jo Parker, of Castle-
maine (Vic.), son of that Edward Stone
Parker who whs a friend of Binghi in the
State’s earlier days. Joseph was a boy of
eight when the family came to Victoria in
1839, and his memory held good to the end.
He talked of Latrobe and Franklin as
friends of the family, and his life-long
regret was that he didn’t buy an acre of
land at the top-end of Collins-street when it
was offered him for a fiver. That was some
years before the gold rush, and “the heart
of Melbourne” hadn’t yet begun to beat. It
was just an early cabbage.
Died on May 29, at Brisbane, John Gra-
ham MacDonald, F.8.G.5., native of Camp-
belltown, where he was born in September,
1834. After knocking about Victoria with
his brother, A. C. MacDonald (also
F.R.G.S.), he went to Queensland and ex-
plored the head waters of the Nogoh and
Belyando rivers, later the Einasleigh and
Lynd. and some of the country towards the
Gulf. In 1863, entering into partnership
with John Robertson, Alexander Stuart and
Captain Towns, he took up a million acres,
including the Plains of Promise. But he
did no good, and after encountering many
reverses gave up trying to be a millionaire.
In 1872 he was appointed P.M. and Gold
Commissioner, and finally was brought down
to the comparative ease of the South Bris-
bane Court, from which he retix-ed in 1905.
Gone west, at 76, Patrick Sheehy, who
was teacher of an R.C. school at Newtown'
(Sydney) in 1870, under the old Council of
Education, wffiich subsidised State and de-
nominational schools alike. In those days,
teachers in N. S. Wales were paid small
salaries, but kept all the fees for them-
selves. The chief difference nowadays is
that there are no fees. Ten years later,
when Parkes carried his Public Instruction
Act, and Church schools lost their subsidy,
Sheehy came into the State service; and as
he was more highly qualified than the average
teacher then available, he was an inspector
by 1890, stationed in the Yass district. He
retired on pension in 1907. A son is also
an inspector, lately transferred from Jimmie
Pannikin’s old West o’ Sunset district to
Young, where he will overhaul schools which
dad inspected a quarter of a century ago.
It looks as though a dramatic career may
have come to a fitting finish. Paul Joseph
has been reported missing in France for the
past month. He is (or was) a son-in-law
of the venerable Dr. Bevan in Adelaide, and
was a great preacher himself. But his too-
ambitious building schemes got himself, his
church and his bankers into a tangle which
the Courts are still trying to straighten out;
and his monument remains, on North Terrace
in the 10-foot walls of an unfinished
“Temple” which he planned and had to
abandon.
Word comes by mail of the death of Prior
Butler, who for many years lived in Aus-
tralia. He belonged to the Order of Car-
melites. Thirty-seven years ago he crossed
from Ireland to South Aus., but remained
there only two years. The R.C.’s at Mel-
bourne wanted a preacher, and Father But-
ler was brought to Melbourne. He was a
poet and theologian combined, and he had a
voice and a personality; and no more popu-
lar preacher has ever been heard week in
and week out in Victoria. After being in
Melbourne half-a-score years, he left Aus-
tralia in 1893. Since then he has been liv-
ing at his old home in Dublin.
Posted missing last October, J. M. Lyons
is now reported killed. Lyons was born
30 years ago at Emmaville (N.S.W.), of
Irish parents, and was a prominent Hiber-
nian at Kensington when the Lutheran
Kaiser began shooting Catholic priests in
Belgium. He started at once to teach him
better, and left as a private for- New Guinea.
When that trouble was over he got to Gal-
lipoli in time for the last few acts and the
curtain, leaving there as sergeant. In France
he was wounded at Pozieres and Ba’paume,
gathering the Military Medal and the Meri-
torious Service distinction ; and after win-
ning a lieutenant’s stars he added the Mili-
tary Cross to the collection. A sister is a
nun at Leichhardt.
Old John Christie, who has sighted tile
home-paddock gate after 84 years, won some
renown among sheepmen in his day. After
bottoming dozens of duffers on various false-
alarm Victorian rushes in the late ’fifties, he
squatted at Hamilton and took to sheep.
Mackersley brought in a few Lin-
colns in ’73 Christie and his brother Peter
got hold of them and founded what soon
came to be the best long-woolled stud in
the world. The old chap kept on at the
business till the end.
“Eight Bells”: Died, at 77, Mrs. M. A.
Clark, of the Mornington Hotel, Sorrento
(Vic.) ; and with her goes the little lime-
stone hut adjoining the pub on the Espla-
nade. Born in a tent on Batman’s Hill,
Melbourne, she moved at the age of seven
to Sorrento, where her father (E. Skelton)
had a lime-quarry. There siie met and
married the late “Lugger Jack” Clark, owner
and skipper of a schooner which' he had
sailed out from Aberdeen, and which
carried the lime up to Melbourne. When
Jack sold his boat he built a real stone hut
for his wife. The old lady wouldn’t have
swapped it for all the local mansions put
together; and she resisted the gentle efforts
of her 10 children to have it pulled down so
that the family pub might be extended.
Slipped out from Parramatta to Paradise,
R. H. Mathew’s, that good Australian scien-
tist who probably knew as much about
Brother Binghi as any white man ever did.
Among other trinkets he held the silver
medal of the Anthropological Society of
France and the bronze medal of N. S. Wales
Royal Society for papers on abo. rock paint-
ings and carvings. Back in the long ago he
was a surveyor in-the north and nor’-west of
N. S. Wales and in Queensland. Incidentally
he published a handbook, “Magisterial In-
quiries,”' for the benefit of J’s.P. A son,
Gregory, is the author of “The Birds of Aus-
tralia.”
Died a£. Cape Town on April 2, • Sir John
Frost, who represented S’Africa. at the open-
ing of the Commonwealth Parliament. In
all the warring factions of his country he
never made a personal enemy. Politician,
soldier, farmer, he fought in all the Kaffirs
from 1549, and was Commandant-General
of the Cape Burghers in the last of them.
But perhaps his best title to fame is that
his tact and good temper broke down much
of the Dutchman’s inveterate and religious
prejudice against sheep-scab eradication. He
was 90 before the book closed.
Squatter Edmond Duffett, of Bundoran
(Vic.), is dead at 53. He was a son of the
late Joseph Duffett, who pursued the law-
fees of a bygone generation and raked a for-
tune from other people’s litigation. When
HOW IT MIGHT BE.
“The Chief Railway Commissioner says that the
Sydney people have less cause for complaint regard-
ing the service than they imagine.”— TELEGRAPH.
THE BOSS: “Overcrowded? Nonsense! Now
in the United States-?"
his bank account was ripe enough the old
man bought Oakbank from the late Tom
Hughes, but afterwards sold it to one of
the Officers, and the family moved to Bun-
doran, with the Silas Hardings and Army-
tages as neighbors. Joseph the younger
came into prominence in his youth as the
owner of a racing string, but the business
brought him small luck and he died long
since. Bachelor Edmond fought off old-
age with a clean shave and a careful thatch-
arrangemept, and he was of a mildly-sportive
disposition, with a lot of pals to deplore his
unexpected passing. The widow Duffett
still lives.
Probably the smallest man in the British
Army is an Australian —Private F. C. Witt-
man, 3ft. Bin., and a Geelong man at that;
Two years ago he was dispenser at Osborne
House in that. Victorian seaside village. Re-
jected for active service on account of his
size, he was passed in Blighty and sent to
India. Here, at Deolali Gamp, on the arrival
of the Australian Pharmaceutical Unit, he
took a light from the cigarette of his friend
Warrant-officer Tubman, who had known
him when Tubman was dispenser at Geelong
Military Camp ; and the warrant-officer has
sent home a photo of the meeting as corrobo-
rative evidence.
John Henry Stonhouse Lydiard, who died
lately in Melbourne, aged 87, was a cousin
of explorer Sturt, whom he followed to Aus-
tralia. John was the first police cadet to
be appointed to gold-escort duty in Vic-
toria, and, later, he ran the escort from
Ballarat to Geelong. Afterwards he was in
the squatting business, and the firm of Mac-
kinnon and Lydiard owned several places in
the Riverina.
Victor Druce, a Melbourne lad who was
one of the gallant forlorn-hopers cut off dur-
ing the late Hun advance, is a prisoner in
Germany. Victor belongs to a branch of
the Druce family, which expected to benefit
by the wrangle over the Duke of Portland’s
pronerty and title. Grandfather Druce,
who market-gardened over at the back of
Toorak, was a cousin of the chief Druce
claimant, and grew some of the nice plums
which the lawyers shared.
James Ashton, the veteran Adelaide
teacher of painting, tells a hard-luck story
about one of his pupils. Last .year she
sent a picture to London for exhibition; it
was sunk by submarine, raised, exhibited,
and got a first-class certificate; on the way
back it was again sent to the bottom, and
stayed there. This year her picture, sent
with a lot of others by Ashton’s pupils, had
exactly the same experience.
Henry Lawson was interrupted in the
course of a yarn the other day. “There’s a
woman waiting for you on the stairs,” said
the boy. “Ah,” said Henry; “there was a
woman waiting for me before I was born.”

The long sea-lane draws to a close twelve thousand
miles from home;
The indigo has vanished from the furrows of the
foam;
it s greening’ as she shallows in; her head is east-
nor’-east;
So rouse below and let her go, and churn the green
to yeastl
We’re staring from the transport deck with half-
believing gaze,
As purple peaks of Cornish land peep shyly through
the haze;
Our spray-stained escort dips and swerves her zigzag
course ahead—
Ho! rouse below and let her go, and board the
deep-sea lead !
For sixty days and sixty nights we’ve trailed the
mighty deep,
Ay, half-way round two hemispheres we’ve trailed it
spring and neap;
F’rom forty south to fifty north, the route the
clippers plied—
Ho! rouse below and let her go, to catch the flooding
tide !
Through Leeuwin gales and rollers high that wash
the Good Hope coast,
Through tropic nights o’er velvet lawns beneath the
wheeling host
AVhich studs the canopy above with jewels diamond
bright-^
Ho ! rouse below and let her go, and make the land
ere night!
Wild Biscay caught her in its throes, the Channel
chopped her rough;
She staggered like a drunken man when greenbacks
smacked the bluff;
Her engines groaned in agony racing at every turn—
But stow your woe and let her go, the Lizard’s well
astern !
The meadow lands of Devonshire all fragrant, fresh
and green
In April garments lie ahead, with Plymouth Sound
between;
And knights of old have her in tow —Dick Grenville,
Hawkins, Drake —
But rouse below and let her go, the port is yet to
make !
Where buxom maids with rosy cheeks are waiting
on the Hoe,
Bidding us welcome to the land we’ve never seen, but
know
By thrilling tales our grandsires told, by art and
rhyme and rote—
Ho! down below, ease up to slow, here comes the
pilot boat!
So-long, old deepsea caravan, we're bosom friends by
now—
We know your holds from stem to stern, your decks
from poop to prow!
Good luck, old girl! Our sea-stale limbs move stiffly
in advance.
Your way is south and home again; our road lies
there—to France!

WHILE men may nowadays buy fewer clothes, it is
certain they buy with more discrimination than ever
before. To-day quality .and value have a different
meaning to that generally accepted in the past, for men are
learning to appreciate true worth in a keen comparison of
quality —which means value in good tailored clothes.
AUSTRAL SAC SUITS to measure satisfy the discriminating taste
of the most particular of well-dressed men. They offer, nioreover,
an unequalled standard of workmanship and finish in every suit made.

The half-year’s profit is greater than that
for any six months prior to the war; and
there is something wrong about this, seeing
that so many thousands of men are produc-
ing nothing, but are consuming wealth at a
far greater speed than ever they did hither-
to. Like a great many more, the B.N.S.W.
is having a good time on the country’s p.n.;
and because the B.N.S.W. is part of the
country, its future will be a lot less hilari-
ous than its present.
First of all,. look at this comparison

The deposits are thus larger by £6,426,946
than they were just before the great trouble
started. _ Now, it is plain enough that the
eountry ,ish’t tens of millions richer than it
was before it sent away tens of millions of
pounds to maintain hundreds of thousands of
soldiers on foreign service—-or owed the
money for it, which means the same thing.
Smith had a deposit of £5OOO with the Wales.
He employed it in buying War Loan. He
lodged the War Loan as security and bor-
rowed £4OOO for some other purpose. Mean-
time somebody else has got the £5OOO and
also the £4000; so that, through the issue of
that War Loan, the deposits are increased
from £5OOO to £9OOO without anything being
added to the wealth of the country. Simi-
larly when a million new notes are circu-
lated, they go to swell various people’s
deposits, although the country is not a
penny richer. The growth of deposits, then,
must be disregarded when we are trying to
find out how the country really stands. The
interest paid to depositors has also increased ;
but it is paid by the country out of its
ordinary earnings. Production has not in-
creased. It has probably decreased, in view
of the number of men who are out of pro-
duction. So the country is not only having
a boom on its own p.n., but it has to pay
its own increased interest earnings. It can
do that comfortably at present on account
of the boom; but by and bye it will find that
it is not nearly as well off as it thought it
was. Already there is a struggle to dodge
paying taxation ; and we have unfortunately
no Woodrow Wilson to call the House to a
serious sense of its duty. But payment
can’t be avoided for ever. It can only be
postponed. And if some dodge it others
must pay more than their share.
How is a bank such as this likely to be
affected? The greater part of our war debt
has been contracted in Australia. But not
all; and we shall be driven to produce hard
to pay the interest on this foreign debt.
Then there will be hundreds of people draw-
ing interest on the local debt who will not
be earning their own interest (many of
them will practically escape direct taxa-
tion) ; and this will mean that production
will have to be speeded up to pay them. If
it isn’t speeded up, then the producers will
have a shocking time. In addition there
will be a very big pension bill to pay year
by year. It seems inevitable that produc-
tion' will be increased!; Parliament will be
driven, for one thing, to put on stiff Protec-
tive duties. Out of this increased produc-
tion the banks will no doubt do very well.
But for a time they will risk consider-
able bad debts, because there is bound to be
a bad disarrangement of things if and when
prices suddenly slump after the war, and
before we have submitted to the inevitable
so far as increased production is concerned.
During that period banks are going to have
an anxious time ; and some, at least, know
it. This bank, for instance, though it has
got in nearly seven millions of deposits since
1914, is keeping practically the whole of
them 'liquid ; and, though advances look to
be about £2,700,000 greater, over £1,700,000
of that is money advanced under the Govern-
ment wheat scheme. Ordinary advances are
evidently being held well in hand ; and no
other policy will enable a bank to give the
help that will almost certainly be necessary
to enable various customers to pull through
the difficulties that are ahead. Exactly
what those difficulties will be we don’t know ;
but we certainly can’t emerge from a period
of lavish national spending into one of hard
paying without difficulties of some sort.

This co. devoted its best attention to the live-
stock market until not so long ago; elsewhere,
perhaps, it felt rather overshadowed by its
big competitor. Then, feeling fresh, it began to
ask why it. should be satisfied; and an
amalgamatioti with a little co. which had
been established by some young and ener-
getic experts in the wool business brought
the old Bagot, Shakes and Lewis co. a new
connection and provided it with two enthusi-
astic wool managers, George Dowling and
George Jeffrey. No doubt it is the increased
wool business that has stood by the co. since
the war started and is mainly responsible for
the big increase in profits, followed now by
an increase in the dividend. It is all very
different from what the management ex-
pected : in the earlier months it seemed
rather rattled —it didn’t know then what
fat war profits foreigners were going to
squeeze out of the Allies, giving British
wool-growers and other patriots an excuse to
do the same sort of thing. In the year to
March, 1914, this co.’s commission and other
earnings were £75,379; in the past year,
though the live-stock part of the business
was no doubt much smaller, the earnings,
after making every provision, including an
unknov i amount for depreciation of premises
and plant, totalled £95,302. The British
Government when it took over the Aus-
tralian wool clip did it at 60 p.c. advance on
the average market price in the month pre-
ceding the war. It was- an astonishing con-
cession of war profits; and of course it had
the effect of bloating thb earnings of this and
similar cos. Further, if the business had
been decently handled, instead of being,
muddled at great expense, as everything that
comes into the hands of W. M. Hughey is,
the cos. would ; have been able to Collect the
larger commissions at smaller expense./How-
ever, the waste which they have had to put
up with has not robbed them of all their
extra profits.
The co. has apparently had particularly
good luck in getting settlements with the
Commonwealth Government; hence its own
liabilities are not much greater than they
used to be :—•

The accounts have the lumping habit badly:'
for instance, “advances, bills receivable and
cash on hand” make one item in the balance-
sheet. But this, at any rate, can be said:
the co. has in the past 10 years shown profits
£58.000 in excess of the dividends; and if it
hasn’t during that period put a bit up its
sleeve, by writing down assets wherever
there was any doubt about them, it hasn’t
been for want of opportunity.

*Thirteen mopths.
This co. went into business in 1899, and
after three years paid an 8 p.c. dividend and
did as much or almost as much continuously
until the year before last, when war troubles
hit it. A co. like this, which specialises in
the clothing of men, is on a different footing
from the fluff merchants. The latter —in
some parts, at any rate —are having a mag-
nificent time on the boom created by War
Loan and big wool money. Fashions are as
changeable and as riotous as ever they were,
and if they ask at the right moment retailers
can get any old price for their flimsies. But
the little extra that men are putting into
glad-rags is counterbalanced by the loss of
trade through so many being in khaki. Fur-
ther, this co. trades in a State where the
bumping up of prices is unpopular. The
directors put it this way: “We have much
stock bought at pre-war prices, and worth
more than the cost price at which it is listed.
It is, however, the policy of the co. to sell all
goods on a basis of cost, so that the custom-
ers of the co. reap the full advantage of
early and judicious buying.”
The table above opens with a fire, but
apart from the inconvenience and the inter-
ruption to trading, the £338 shown as
written off was the only loss. However, this
incident affected the co.’s history, the man*
agement deciding to purchase a freehold in
place of renting premises. Here are the
balance-sheet movements over a period of
nine years:—

The co.’s premises originally cost about
£20,000, and to finance the purchase £13,241
was raised on mortgage which cost 4f p.c.
p.a. The new premises also provided addi-
tional showroom accommodation, and to sup-
plement stocks £15,000 of new capital was
got in. Besides this increase in capital,
liabilities have grown by £5BBB during the
nine years. There is now the freehold, of a
book value of £21,212; and since December,
1908, £9184 has been added to stocks, £6856
to cash, and £7OO to plant, which has been
written down by half. Meanwhile book debts
have been reduced by £5766. Those figures
show an improvement of £11,298 for the nine
years. The feature of recent balance-sheets
has been the reduction in the amount of cus-
tomers’ accounts; four years ago consider-
ably more than half the capital was repre-
sented by this item. The year before last the
co. had to write off “a very large sum by
reason of customers having left for the
Front, and at the time of leaving being evi-
dently unable to discharge all their liabili-
ties.” So the directors had a spring cleaning,
and are apparently resolved to have no un-
tidiness in the future.

.We have to guess at some of the figures in
the last line. For the first three quarters
of the year customers got a rebate or trade
bonus of £10,097, and it has been assumed
on past experience that they drew £4OOO for
the last quarter: the bonus, for this period,
at any rate, was Is. in the £. Profits, it
will be noted, have been sadly and steadily
cut into during the last few years; and
though the dividend still looks a fine pot-full,
it really isn’t when ,you blow the froth off.
For the reserves are made up as follows: —
Premiums on shares, £72,185; reserve ac-
count, £30,000; reserve for equalisation of
dividend, £5000; unappropriated profit (esti-
mated, for the reason mentioned above),
£5Bl. Thus shareholders, taking them in
the lump, get £14,015 on £124,742, or 11|
p.c. for the year. Still even that is better
than a pint of yesterday’s beer. It is,
however, very different from what it was
in the days before the Water Waggoner
used the war so adroitly and closed
pubs at six and told the men that
they ought to be ashamed to spend money
on beer when the poor boys were in the
trenches —and the poor girls were wanting
20-guinea furs so badly. On top of that
came very heavy increases in costs and
general charges—a very elastic term where
oreweries that are fighting hard are con-
cerned. In the year ended Jan., 1915, the
gross profit on manufacturing account was
£133,783; and cartage and freight, special
discounts and management and travelling
exes, and salaries, lighting, income tax, rates
and repairs and rent cost £54,187. For the
past year, with a gross profit on manufactur-
ing account of £146,347, the outgoings were
no less than £104,364. This suggests that
the co. has more than maintained its trade,
but that it is abnormal costs and unusual
exes., apart altogether from brewery costs,
which have taken the sparkle out of the net
earnings.
The position from the balance-sheet point
of view has changed as follows: —

The liabilities are mostly overdraft (£68,856)
and money owing on open account; and they
are more than covered by stock and book
debts, leaving the premises and plant and a
bit besides to represent the capital and re-
serves. The latter, apart from the premium
capital, are rather slim; but the position is
probably better than it looks, because in the
earlier years, rather than show a big amount
undistributed, the directors wrote down
premises and plant generously. The former,
which cost £104,635, stand in the books now
at £84,257; and the plant has been written
down out of earnings from £136,123 to
£74,833.

This co. is handicapped hy “the continued
difficulty in obtaining copper wire and its
high cost,” so that, with few exceptions, the
only new connections are those which can be
made from existing, mains. Nevertheless 413
consumers were added during the half-year,
making the present total 5299. Additions of
this sort have their advantages, though: they
increase the revenue without piling up over-
head or capital charges. Hence the substan-
tial improvement in profits notwithstanding
the solid increase in some of the running
costs. The co. was formed primarily to
carry out an agreement with the Balmain
municipality under which rights to supply
power were conceded in return for the
destruction of garbage. The Act which was
passed gave also the right to extend the
mains; and contracts for long periods have
been made with various neighboring coun-
cils. Mostly these provide for treatment at
least as favorable as that given by the City
of Sydney’s Electric Supply Department to
its outside customers; and this and the gas
competition make it unlikely that the co. will
ever pay glittering dividends. Still anything
as solid as this stock, yielding 8 p.c., with the
probability of something better, isn’t to be
picked up every morning before breakfast.
Last year, after writing off £10,200, besides
paying for all current repairs and renewals,
the co. showed almost exactly 9 p.c. on the
share capital of £234,315, notwithstanding
that during part of the year some of the
capital was earning but little. A lot depends,
of course, upon whether the amount written
off is sufficient to cover general depreciation.
The management has given very careful con-
sideration to this, and works upon expecta-
tion-of-life tables more stringent than the
text-bookB prescribe. The aggregate amount
written off, by the way, is shown in the
published accounts as a depreciation reserve.
The reserve is not formally invested apart
from the . business; but on April 30 there
were liquid and more or less liquid assets
£44,715 in excess of all liabilities other than
debentures. There is now £50,000 outstand-
ing on 54 p.c.. debentures; all but £7OOO of
the 7 p.c.. lot issued at a time before the co.
got well into the collar, have now been con-
verted into shares. The small balance may
be converted up to December 1 next. Those
that are not thus dealt with are redeem-
able on May 31 next. Later on there will

be need to extend the generating plant. For
this purpose 60,000 shares were issued : they
are now paid to 155., ss. having been got in
during the half-year, in terms of the prospec-
tus, though, in view of the impossibility of
laying down the plant at a reasonable price
at present, the directors would have been
better pleased if the shareholders had put the
money into War Loan for the time being.
However, like most other people, they pre-
ferred that the directors should put it_ there
and pay them 8 p.c. instead of putting it
there themselves and getting only 4\ p.c.

The Perpetual Trustee Co. (Sydney) is
doing what The Bulletin suggested some
time ago that almost every trustee co. in
Australia might well do. The capital of
nearly all of them is small —very small in
comparison with the trusts they have in hand
—and they might advantageously strengthen
their position and at the same time get in
money for investment in War Loan by in-
creasing their capital. The Perpetual’s
directors have decided to raise £25,000 by
making a call of ss. per share payable on
July 1. The amount will go into the next
War Loan.

Now that the prospect of the main shoot
breaking away from the porphyry and becom-
ing payable again at depth is doubtful, the
prolongation of the life of Ivanhoe (W.A.)
depends mainly on what can be unearthed by
lateral development in the higher levels.
Some promising finds have already been re-
ported, and, although the co.’s holding is only
24 acres, a good deal of that area contains
makes of ore which have never been exploited
to any extent.
* * * *
Payne’s Find (W.A.) is nearing the end.
One tributor has given it up, another can’t
do anything on account of the workings
being flooded by surface-water, and mean-
time the directors, probably recognising the
hopelessness of things, have decided to
look for a buyer for the machinery. Payne’s
Find is, in some respects, like a lot more of
the smaller Westralian gold-mines that have
been floated in the East. Managers seem
always able to discover bits of stone that
contain visible gold, some of which are
assayed with more or less phenomenal
results, and the rest are sent to Adel-
aide or Melbourne to be exhibited. Then
some ore reserves are exposed and a
battery is ordered. When milling starts the
first few months are generally sufficient to
treat all the picked ore set on one side, and
after that the returns do not even cover
expenses. Ultimately the co. uses up all the
cash obtained by one or two reconstructions,
and the mine is closed down and operations
abandoned. A report at the outset from a
mining engineer of standing would in nearly
every case save the public a lot of money.
* * *
From Grut’s report on the Golden Butter-
fly’s option at Tuckabianna (W.A.) :
The mine consists of one short shoot which appears
to be rapidly petering 0ut.... The final payment of
£3OOO to close the option is not justified by develop-
ment up to the present time.... In view of the work
already done and money expended further exploratory
work is desirable.
All that needs to be added is that sharehold-
ers should have had Grut’s or some other
independent expert’s opinion months ago,
instead of newspaper puffs and glowing
“official” reports. The vendors have been
asked to extend the option, but perhaps it
would be the best thing that ever happened
to the co. if they refused.
Manager Aldridge estimates that he has
40,000 tons of 50s. ore in sight above No. 2
at the Edna May Consolidated. On the basis
of costs at 225. 6d. this should mean over
£50,000 of profits in sight, with 65,000
shares to eat them up. Then why the market
price of about 10s.? The last six months’
run gave off the plates 40860 z. from 9376
tons, with 16s. 6d. per ton going into the
residues. Profit was £5359, and after payT
ing two sixpennies the co. had £1713 in the
bank. As Edna May is out for pumping
compensation there may be * blister on that
balance. Costs are high for the shallow
depth worked, but with the stope at No. 1
level 30ft. wide for 100 ft. long and the ground
above heavy, close filling has to be done. In
the main reef the south stope is 18ft. wide.
Obviously quartz is in plenty. The only
nigger in the woodheap seems to be the doubt
whether the grade will support Aldridge’s
sampling figures when such big bodies of
ore have to be tackled. That values are
irregular is clear from the in-and-out yields
of the last two or three crushings.
“One of the Vendors” : These are the facts
about the Sirdar case (W.A.). To date
Mr. Shallcross has had about two years’
exemption. The vendors are still owed
£BOO. After the last application for exemp-
tion was refused the mine was left open for
forfeiture, and the vendors, to protect their
own interests, had to step in and apply for
forfeiture. The Wild Cat’s suggestion that
back-stairs influence may be depended upon
is very apt, as the various Ministers have
on three occasions gone direct against the
decision of the Warden, who knew the facts
and the local circumstances, and have
granted exemption in respect to the leases.
Why a Department which does this sort of
thing goes to the expense of Wardens, unless
it be to bluff the prospector, isn’t clear.

The Junction, the poor relation of the
Broken Hill family, didn’t have much in the
way of luck last half-year. Of the 26 weeks
it worked only 17, six being lost through a
general strike, two because somebody wanted
a spell at Christmas and New Year and the
ninth through a strike at the Central, which
mills this co.’s ore. The profit was thus
only £4172, though nothing is written off
for depreciation and expected surpluses have
been reckoned as profit. As 16,046 tons
sulphide and 644 tons carbonate ore were
delivered, the figures, taking the boom prices
into account, don’t hold out much hope of a
brilliant future. Still, the directors think
they have made a much better contract than
they have had with the Sulphide people.
Amalgamated Zinc (De Bavay’s) are put-
ting up a small lead mill to treat 1500 tons
of Junction ore per week for the next four
years; total, 300,000 tons. Perhaps this is
the most cheerful thing the directors have to
say :■ —
Before concluding the contract Amalgamated Zinc
took steps to ascertain definitely that we had the
quantity of ore in sight and blocked out, the result
being satisfactory to both sides.
The co. is to get “more favorable terms for
lead and silver contents” and also, “share
payment for all zinc concentrates produced
and sold. Hitherto we received nothing
whatever for zinc contents.” The old con-
tract with the Sulphide Corp. has been re-
newed till August 5; then deliveries will be
taken by the De Bavay’s. The Junction’s
sulphide is not a rich ore: last half-year’s
averages were B.Soz. silver, 12.1 p.c. lead
and 7.7 zinc ; but if with a normal market
the co. can’t make 7s. a ton out of it it will
only be because of very severe mining costs..
The co. is heavily loaded —72,567 shares
paid to 10s. and 200,000 contribs. paid to-
6s. sd. Net liquid assets (including stores)
were about £15,000 at the end of the half-
year.
* * * *
“Onlooker”; There are two points in the
Broken Hill Prop.’s reconstruction which
call for criticism. The capitalisation of the
reserves, amounting to £1,500,000, was a.
sufficient inducement for present sharehold-
ers to supply the new capital willingly and
without effort. Then what need was there
to get the shares underwritten at a cost of
£31,899, or 2s. a share? It is making a
present to a select group of brokers of that
sum for lending their names to the prospec-
tus. At 40s. the shares are too cheap. The
co. ought to have called for tenders for the
318,994 unissued shares, first among the
shareholders and afterwards amongst the
investing public in London and Australia.
* * * *
The one justification for the grab made by
Dyason when he fused his five miles of Cen-
tral leases at Bendigo was success. That it
hasn’t come so far isn’t his fault any more
than it was that of his predecessors. The
poor zone had to be got through, just as the
desert has to be crossed to reach the oases
beyond. Bendigo wouldn’t mind that if it
was not faced with the prospect of a big
scrapping of plant and the permanent dis-
mantling of mines that might have wealth
awaiting the pick. As scrap-iron has high
war-values, the temptation is to sell, especi-
ally if cash isn’t flowing from yields. Ben-
digo wants that temptation removed. That
is the basic truth in the appeal to Mines
Minister Sam Barnes for the State to buy up
some of the Eaglehawk plants. Barnes
isn’t enthusiastic, because he has seen the
wilting process at Walhalla. Another prob-
lem confronts him. This is the demand of
the crowd that wants excised from Dyason’s
area some of the ground unworked. If labor
conditions are to prevail, Barnes can’t say
“No.” Even if someone else hits on to gold
the effect on the whole field will be instan-
taneous ; but he will have to see that the
newcomers aren’t parasites, and that Dyason
isn’t plundered.
* * * *
“Your winding and crushing plants are
all in good working order,” is the cheeriest
item in Gullock’s report on Nuggetty Ajax,
Daylesford (Vic.). The bank and the
Mines Department have the first call on
those assets, but with scrap-iron worth what
it is, that security isn’t to. be sneezed at.
Gullock is poking about in No. 3 level, where
the bunch of soecimens cheered the hive of
speculators for less than one shift. At No.
6 the lode has size but no substance. The
best thing showing at No. 10 is nice slate
country, so all Gullock’s luck is necessary to
help things along.
Some New Langi Logan, Ararat (Yic.),
figures: Working account, £112,411; plant
£29,408; cash to vendors, £5OOO. Last hal f-
year it cost £4OO a week to run Nos. 1 - an< j
2 shafts, but for a month the mine was idle.
A shot was made-at extracting wa^h; nn( j
although 505 fathoms gave 628f0z.., it d jdn’t
pay, not because the average wasn’t good,
but because the staff available was too small
to turn the wash to profit in bulk. Work
ofi No. 2 shaft is going on down the Cath-
cart gutter, and, as the lead is dipping fast,
plainly_ the junction with the main Langi
gutter is ahead. Beyond this point is where
values should make if ever the gutter is to
pay. When the last 1000 ft. of driving to
connect up with the south level from No. 1
shaft is dome, that problem will be solved.
But what a mint of money has been ex-
pended to reach that point!
* * * *
Fifteen months ago mention was made
here of the satisfactory exploration of the
Bowen coal-field (Q.). At that time there
were several small cos.; but in order to
mine, equip and trade to better advantage
five of them agreed to amalgamate as the
Bowen Consolidated Coal-mines, Ltd. The
vendors take 25,000 £1 shares and approxi-
mately £1250 for leases covering 15 sq.
miles; 10,000 have been subscribed for by
them; and 40,000 are offered for public
subscription. On February 19 the Govern-
ment Geologist reported:—
On the result of the boring done by the Govern-
ment to November, 1916, I estimated the quantity of
coal proved at 46,400,000 tons, of which 22,000,000
tons would probably be available for market. Since
that date, however, a number of additional bores
have been put down, which has enormously increased
the estimate previously formed.
The State has reserved areas and will no
doubt open a mine; and a railway is now
under construction to the field. The
present North Queensland consumption which
this co. and the State would probably divide
is reckoned at 140,000 tons coal and 30,000
tons coke p.a.; and plant to raise 150,000
tons coal and make 50,000 tons coke p.a.
would, it is estimated, cost, £25,000. The
quality is all right: Bowen coal has been
recommended for loco, use, and coking tests
are quite satisfactory—as Mt. Elliott no
doubt assured itself before it decided to have
its copper refinery here.
*• * * *
The latest monthly return from Mount
Morgan suggests that Many Peaks will have
to look out for a new market. Morgan's
adaptation of the concentrator to handle
20,000 tons of crude ore in four weeks for a
return of about 8000 tons concentrates has
got rid of .12,000 tons of silica which under
the old system of smelting would have
required a n enormous quantity of flux. Mor-
gan needs to be economical, for its mill is
recovering a shade under 2 p.c. copper.
**. - * *
Chiefly on account of labor troubles Mt.
Cuthbert, Cloncurry (Q.), is very sad. As
at February 28 the old debenture debt stood
at £55,500." there was £46,106 owing to de-
ferred creditors and £11,304 to sundry credi-
tors ; aiad bank overdrafts totalled £14,486.
The scrip taken off the co.’s hands by Sydney
brokers and th e smelting done since February
have, however 1 , eased the position slightly.
After allowing £464-8 for depreciation, the
six months’ work shewed a loss of £4750.
The copper output was 668 tons from 9549
tons ore and 3819 tonsifluxes, compared with
1169 tons blister in the previous term.
Development work has been at a standstill
for 12 months. Ore reserves last year were
estimated at 141,514 tons containing 11,631
tons copper.
* * * *
The Australian manganese mine (S.A.)
has 80 men employed and expects to send
away from 200 tons to 500 tons per month.
The ore is carted to ttie railway, railed to
Adelaide and shipped. One lot of 117 tons
sent to Liverpool assayed 85 p.c. manganese
dioxide, with less than 1 3 p.c. iron. The
directors don’t state the* price received, but
they are evidently satisfied, for they have
secured freight space foir 2200 tons.
* * * *
Four months ago II übert Barrett paid
£4OOO for the Mt. Nola.n tin-mine, just out-
side Herberton (N.Q.). It has since re-
turned him £3OOO net., the last crushing
being 8| tons concentrate s from 70 tons of
ore —roughly 12 p.c.
* * * *
Bathurst Brick, Tile arid Pottery Co. has
baked its last pound of clay after giving-
early prospects of becomir g one of the most
profitable near-western (i N.S.W.) monopo-
lies in the line. The co. < »pened up business
with 14,305 issued £1 ? shares and £4600
worth of machinery and improvements on
the clay flats. The first y ear showed a dead
loss of £BB2. The. skaurt holders were told
that it was “unforeseem difficulties.” The
co. confined itself almost entirely to tiles,
though tl.e manufacture* of bricks and pipes
and po f s w as recomimended by old hands;
and \ n the drying the bulk of the tiles
crac ked and had to be thrown away. Altera-
tions in the process didn’t affect much, and
bne co. has now decided to have a funeral.
Two prospectors, J. M. Stanton and E.
Loughlan, have found osmiridium between
the Mt. Stewart silver-mine and the foot .of
the Meredith Ranges (Tas.), The locality
had been entirely neglected by prospectors
during recent years. In one creek they got
over an ounce in one day, and over £lOO
worth in three weeks. There are between
30 and 40 hands on the field, and most of
them are working payable ground. The
metal has most likely been shed from the
serpentine in the Meredith Ranges. It is
not unlikely that it occurs all through the
serpentine belt, between the new fields and
the Wilson River deposits. The metal is
worth £22 per oz. at present.
. Cloncmry (Q.) produced copper worth
*|>232,657 in 1917, compared with
11,199,099 in 1916. The district has enor-
mous deposits of low-grade ore that W. H.
Corbould, of Mount Elliott, is certain can
be handled profitably if worked on a large
scale, with copper at £6O per ton. Elliott
has been off the dividend list since 1913, and
its present object is to demonstrate that a
furnace recovery of 4 p.c. copper can be
made profitable with stores, fuel, labor, etc.,
obtainable at reasonable rates. But he isn’t
making large profits at present because ex-
penses are very high and strikes very numer-
ous.
* * * *
The cry heard above all others on the
Westralian mining-fields at present is for
labor. Kalgoorlie and Boulder could do
with hundreds more men. Mines scattered
over the country beyond are either closed
down for want of labor or are worked short-
handed. On the Murchison the same condi-
tions prevail, and at Greenbushes, where
claim-holders are frantically eager to obtain
tin in order to get rich quick, men cannot be
found to take on mostly open-cut work at
Is. 6d. a shift above the award rate.

A WOMAN’S
LETTER
Sydney, June 3, 1918
My Deab Aeini, —
On King’s Birthday Adrian Knox became
a 0.M.G., like 0. J. Roberts, who kept the
pub at the Corner of Market and George
streets and was a good friend of Henry
Parkes. These distributions of “honors”
are getting more and more grotesque. Of
course you can name a dozen unhonored
men who have done greater public service
than the chairman of the A. J.G.; and a
dozen more who have done far less and been
given something better.
Major-General Feetham, killed in France
on. Good Friday, was the eldest brother of
J. O. Feetham, who now bishes at Towns-
ville, and formerly humped his swag round
western N. S. Wales as a “bush brother.”
Another brother is a barrister in the Trans-
vaal.
A garden of sympathy is blooming for The
Bulletin’s old friend E. S. Emerson, of
Brisbane, whose wife reached the end in a
private hospital recently. Mrs. Emerson, a
daughter of the Merediths of Swansea, a well-
known Tasmanian family, was a wholesome
Australian. She had all her versifying hus-
band’s reverence for the glories of the Bush,
from the colorful young leaves of the tea-tree
to the song of a bird, and added to this a
remarkable talent for translating the joyful
chuckles of bush-warblers into human speech.
In the 12 years during which she was with
him, Emerson probably had his soundest
and most helpful critic in his own home, a
fact to which he paid praceful tribute in
verses that were going through the press—
in trust of her recovery—even as the end
came. Returned soldiers, for whom Emer-
son is a solid worker, paid their respects at
the graveside.
When the results of “Cupid Camouflaged”
are breathed in its ear, there will be joy in
the Red Cross counting-house. The weight of
the local peerage has been behind the chariot
for weeks, and the night brought a serpen-
tine procession of cars from our best suburbs
to theTheatreßoyal. Captain Saltmarshe, one
of his Ex.’s nice boys, was the hero, with
Rosamund Lumsdaine as the best girl in the
show. Australasian Films and Union
Theatres Limited charged nothing for their
big part in the affair. Mrs. T. H. Kelly;
the slender sprite, Mrs. Yenour Nathan;
Jim Osborne, dark-eyed Betty Levy, and the
Knox clan were amongst those who also
posed. Lady Davidson, with Mrs. Elliot,
wife of the Commissioner for the Pacific,
was in the audience. There’s only one
bee in the honey. The Sydney amateurs
claim that theirs was the brain-wave which
originated the society film-novelette in Aus-
tralia ; yet Melbourne got in first with
Captain Conant’s “His Only Chance.”
A lot of those who were left out of the pic-
ture must have been glad to bursting-point
when some of the “close-ups” hit the sheet.
Either our Very Best People’s leaders are
older than we thought or they don’t know the
tricks of movie make-up. The camera at
point-blank range was not kind even to the
experienced Mrs. T. H. Kelly, who played
the match-making mother and looked twice
her years. It was a relief to everyone when
she came on afterwards in her proper person
to help Jimmy Osborne auction the souvenir
booklets and get another 210 guineas for the
Cross.
The plot of “Cupid” is a shambling thing
which wanders round from function to func-
tion so that the Very Naicest may perambu-
late before the camera. The names of the
supers and garden-party guests were squeaked
and shouted in the picture gloom as they
came and went.
Though Wilfred Docker has not been
quite the same man since the sudden death
of his old sweetheart a while ago, he still
carries a big load of voluntary war-work.
And he has been hon. treas. of an Anglican
Home Mission Society for a long 24 years.
Last week Governor Davidson handed him
an illuminated address —the usually embar-
rassing tribute was in book form —on behalf
of the mission, which not only searches for
the heathen with spiritual intentions, but
also asks him if he’s short of a square meal.
The useful Sydney citizen keeps young at
72.
Lieut. Arthur Thompson, a returned man
with two years’ service, met Mabel Paige
at Christ Church last week and captured the
position. The bride is a daughter of the late
T. H. Paige, of North Sydney, and the
’groom’s parental roof is at Darling Point.
The new Mrs. Thompson was wed in her
travelling dress—ash-of-roses gabardine, with
a black hat on a graceful head.
Sydney friends of young Grimwade, a
Melbourne man who had 12 months of the
horrors of being a German prisoner, met the
Flying Corps man on his arrival here. But
they can’t talk calmly of his sufferings on
the Butcher’s Table, where a wounded
prisoner has an arm or a leg amputated with-
out a whiff of chloroform.
Alma Baker’s appeal for more battleplanes
has drawn £2703 from Hugh and Murdo
Mackenzie, of Tooloombah station, North
Queensland. Officially it will be “Australia
No. 28 ; Queensland No. 3 —The Mackenzie.”
The A.I.F. has its “Pinching Parson,”
Chaplain Dexter, who will get somehow what
he wants for his Australians in France. It’s
said that he went to sea as a boy, and after-
wards had his own craft, which traded off the
Indian coast. He gave this up in 1000 to
join Lumsdaine’s Indian Horse, and got the
D.C.M. for his work as despatch-rider to
“Bobs.” Turned parson via Durham (Eng.)
Uni. at the age of 40. In Gallipoli for his
gallantry when, in spite of severe wounds, he
kept on helping the other wounded men to
shelter, he won the D.S.O.
Another Red Cross “auxiliary” haven
was recently blessed by the Cullen lady—
Rathmore, in the Neutral Bay garden zone.
Billjim’s thanks for this roomy convalescent
home are due to Miss Davey.
At St. _ Stephen’s on Saturday solicitor
John Jamieson, of Temora, claimed the pro-
mise of Mrs. Georgie Paterson, widow of
the late Edgar Paterson, of Edinburgh. The
lady wore a smart white tailor-made, with
diamonds, the ’groom’s wedding gift. An
ermine stole kept off the draughts. First to
the Mountains; then home to Temora, where
John has built a new nest for his wife.
The Soldiers’ Club had its birthday party
—the bouncing boy is three years old—in
the dawn of this week. Governor Davidson
was the guest of honor.
Sydney journalists farewelled Dr. Gel-
latly and Farmer Whyte in the Mary Eliza-
beth tea-rooms the other evening; and other
so-longs were said at the Press Club.. Gel-
latly will presently hang up his new hat in
the office of the Commonwealth Bureau of
Science and Industry. The Shakspearean
Whyte goes to Brisbane to edit the Daily
Mail.
Here is pretty
little Tien Hogue,
who has been the
English feather in
“The Bird of Para-
dise’s” mixed plu-
mage. One of the
quiverful of a for-
mer News editor and
Education Minister,
the vivacious Syd-
ney girl has a special
gift for making her-
self heard in a singu-
larly clear voice that
hits the last plank
in a theatre. Tien
started her show
career on horseback
in a Woy Woy
swamp, and fell off
for the films with immense success. From
the pictures she moved up to “Within the
Law,” and played in the second company
through N. S. Wales and Queensland. Her
opening night was on fateful August 4,
1914. Later on Tien may go to U.S.A. with
Muriel Starr’s co. But for the present she
stays in Australia, and has gone to Mel-
bourne to join the “Thirteenth Chair” pro-
duction. The unusual experience of hav-
ing never been out of grease-paint since
she booked her first engagement is the brainy
girl’s happy lot. In brighter days she
was the little sister who hung on brother
Oliver’s arm. Since then the arm has been
used to hit Turk or Hun, for “Trooper
Bluegum” is in his fourth year of service
with the Light Horse.
At 21 R. W. Howard, M.C., was a flight-
commander in the A.F.C. A Newcastle boy,
he was at Sydney Uni. engineering scliooj
when war broke loose. He enlisted as a
sapper, saw service on the Desert, was
wounded in France, and has just been pro-
moted captain, with his 22nd birthday still
ahead.
Brazilian Consul-General Dunn has two
sons at the Front. The elder is getting a
wounded limb bandaged after the March offen-
sive. The younger, after recovering dam-
ages from a bayonet, is again in France.
St. James’s Hall was “sold out” on Fri-
day evening for the 2nd D.A.C. show. Presi-
dent F. T. S. O’Donnell lingered on the
chilly steps to meet the genial Davidson,
for whom there was a guard of honor. Hon.
sec. Mrs. Ballantine and her coadjutor Mrs.
Meredith sat with the sub-regal party on
the Axminster. Mr. Elliot, Commissioner
for the Pacific, came with the Governor, and
heard the Liverpool Headquarters Military
Band play the Allies’ national airs. Philip
Wilson, stricken with a heavy cold, sang,
with the help of a beaten-up egg, hurriedly
administered in an ante-chamber; and
pianist Winifred Burston, contralto Lilian
Gibson, harpist Winifred Carter and Harry
de Robeck —the last in a humorous mono-
logue—preceded T. J. McMahon’s well-told
story of Germany’s grip on the Pacific.
Italy’s Day is taking form in the hands
of a big committee which puts in overtime
at the job of organ-
ising pastimes and
highway robbery.
Amongst Italians
prominent in this
amiable work is
Captain Lubrano.
Of old a shipmaster,
but 18 years resi-
dent in Sydney and
with an Australian
wife to pour out his
coffee, he still con-
fesses to one other
love. That Australia
should exhibit such
warmth of feeling
for the Red Cross
of his dear native
country sets him a-
glow with joy. In
November last he collected £l5OO for the
hard-pressed society which has to work
under almost incredible difficulties where the
heroic Alpini keep Austria at bay. “The
central committee sits in Rome, where Sena-
tor the Count della Somaglia, president of
the Italian Red Cross since the war, has his
headquarters. Head of the Voluntary Nurses
is the Duchess of Aosta, first cousin of
Victor Emmanuel. I was in Europe .when
the war began and for some time before.
From the beginning there was only one
course open to Italy. She had to side with
the Allies: and she W’ill not flinch to the end
—for the liberty of Europe; for the world’s
release from the Tyrant who threatened —•
yes, and still threatens—to enslave all free
peoples.”
Consul-General Chayet is going to Guat-
emala, and Sydney will have to say good-
bye to the scholarly Frenchman. A minor
w r ail goes up from the girls of the French
Circle conversations, to whom he has dealt
out idioms in slow and careful speech, dress-
ing it, too, in most attractive fashion. The
flapper and her elder sister congratulate
Guatemala.
Comforts ladies are raking their brains
for ideas calculated to fill Billjim’s Christ-
mas stocking. One Army Service Corps
circle has decided to risk a Beauty Compe-
tition. Mrs. A. A. King (Maitland) is the
heroine in charge. Local residents can.
vote (if they pay), the faces of the com-
batants being thrown on the sheet at dis-
trict picture shows.
Swathed in comforters, but leaving their
goloshes at home (the winter is a dry one),
the Cult sallied forth during the week to
hoar Verbrugghen chat on the domestic
habits of Brahms. There was music to fit
the subject; and Haydn was represented in
one of his most impressive moments.
Sixty years ago the Greens of Parra-
matta could have given inches, probably, to
any other family of girls in Australia : there
was a handsome houseful of them, who car-
ried their heads mostly six feet high. The
eldest, who married Jesse Hack in 1849,
died only last week. The old home, Rock
Farm, on the Dundas hills, where they all
were born, has remained in the family
throughout.
Billjim’s Christmas is coming, and the
Trench Mortar Susies got in early with a
glittering gift afternoon in the King’s Hall.
Song and piano drowned the moans of the
plundered.
Mrs. Ellis Gulliver is hon. sec. of the
Elizabeth-street Voluntary Workers’ Caf6,
which is representative of the original lot
who put on aprons in the Moore-street tem-
porary premises. To help the larder the
Cheer-o girls gave an 'excellent little show
in the Repertory. Mrs. Bennett White w’as
in charge.
The late J. A. Delany’s cantata “Captain
Cook” will be the Apollo Club’s chief effort
on June 11.
The tube is making insidious attacks on
the skirt. The latest winter vagaries in
dress only hint at the revival of the bolster
fashion —the wretched thing you can also
call a tube. The fashion plates are almost
back to the hobble, with the slit in front of
.the skirt, and the long jacket.
The wife of Angelo Tornaghi died last
week at Coogee. She used to be Eva Pitt, a
daughter of the late G. M. Pitt, whose leafy

Clive Edginton has earned all of the little
“Empire” decoration that he has got for his
work as Assistant Red Cross Commissioner
in Egypt. He’s a big-hearted young Aus-
tralian with an austere manner—so used to
wrapping up other people’s troubles and
difficulties and carting them off in his old
kit-bag that the handing round of comforts
to Billjim must have been a congenial job.
Among the many suggestions which are
being thrust upon the repatriation authori-
ties have they, I wonder, heard anything about
the straw jackets for bottles? Of late these
humble but necessary garments have been
provided by brother Jap at a price calcu-
lated to give any good unionist cold shivers;
but brother Jap is, like everyone else, short
of shipping space. The result is that straw’
capsules are now said to cost a compara-
tively fabulous amount. Couldn’t we give
shattered Billjim a chance?
The Kindergarten Union feels that its
luck is out. Its general sec., Ellen Desailly,
is away on leave, and its acting sec., Miss
Giblin, is on the sick list. So there’s no

August, in which it takes part with the
Returned Soldiers’ League.

Stripes and cheeks fight cheerfully in the

But over all broods the tartan skirt. Heavy

Australian sunshine.

WHEN "OUT OF SORTS” TAKE
CALIFORNIA SYRUP OF FIGS.
If fretful, feverish, constipated, bilious
or tongue coated, take this delicious
fruit laxative at once.
The vague, general discomfort of being
“out of sorts,” when the stomach turns
against food, the eye is dull and the tongue
coated and heavy, can be banished in a few
hours by a dose of California Syrup of Figs
—“Califig.” There is no need to put up
with these things until to-morrow, waiting
for bedtime to take medicine. California
Syrup of Figs—“Califig”—will begin to do
you good the moment you take it—at any
hour —and cause no discomfort. This plea-,
sant-tasting, refreshing fruit laxative
cleanses the stomach, gently sweeps away all
accumulations of undigested food, and stimu-
lates the liver to assist in relieving the
bowels. By evening the tongue will be clear
again and vhe overflow of bile swept away;
you will be yourself again, with a good appe-
tite and digestion. This is the medicine
which does such wonders for children of all
ages ; but it is every bit as .good for grown-
up people, and there are full directions for
every age with the bottle. Take care to buy
the genuine, as there are imitations on the
market. Ask for “Califig”—California
Syrup of Figs, and look for the name and
trade mark of the California Fig Syrup Co.
AIJ. chemists sell “Califig”—California Syrup
of Figs—in bottles of two sizes, 1/1£ and
1/9. [2

Melbourne, June 3, 1918.
My Dear Yarrie,—
Brighton, his native city, turned out in
tuil warpaint to welcome back Captain Bob
Grieve, the first Australian cricketer to
secure the V.C. A solid young athlete of
less than 30, the grit which enabled him to
win a football match for Wesley stood to
him when he sprinted over 50 yards of shell-
swept ground at Septieme Barn, near Ypres,
bombed out of action two German machine-
guns and organised the 37th for a fresh
advance before he fell wounded. He is one
of the Flinders-lane firm df Connibere, Grieve
and Connibere, and every employee, the girls
wearing, his battalion colors, turned up to
cheer, him on his return. If he recovers
sufficiently from his wound, he can re-enlist
and go back as a private. That is the new
rule for the discouragement of officers who
feel like winning V.C.’s in future.
Mrs. Brudenell White, whose husband now
wears one of the brassiest of Australia’s
brass. hats, is. a daughter of Walter David-
son, in his lifetime the sportish owner of
Coliban Park. Two Davidson boys, Hal and
Norman, joined up early in the war; but
they had no luck. Hal was hurt in a road-
accident while training at Broadmeadows,
and was discharged; Norman died of menin-
gitis at sea. General White himself, who
was close handy when General Bridges fell
at Gallipoli, has had some close calls. The
other week he had occasion to hop out of
his car in a shell-swept sector, leaving the
chauffeur in charge. When he came back a
tew moments later there was no car and no
chauffeur—only a wreckage, human and
mechanical, and an ugly hole in the ground
where the car had been.
Home in Hobart for a spell after strenu-
ous war-work, Dr. Eveline Cohen, once Miss
Benjamin. She has served in the R.M.C. at
various places, and the British Red Cross
gave her a life ticket in recognition of her
devoted labor.
In announcing Edward Solomon’s gift of
the Sorrento Hotel as a home for Australian
nurses, the Argus mentioned:—•
The fact that it is immediately opposite the
police-station is considered important by Mr. Solo-
mon, in view of the purpose to which it is to be
devoted.
Melbourne has been trying ever since to
make out just what the dear old Argus
meant.
“The Prince [of Wales], whom I have
got to know well, spent the whole evening
with me—a delightful three hours together,”
says Staff-Captain Herbert J. Ratcliffe in
a letter to relatives at Ballarat. “He is a
real top-holer, and will make a fine king.”
The best of keeping good company is that
you can give it a reference. H.R.H. is all
right now.
Little Athol Levey, of South Yarra, niece
of John Grice, is still plugging away in Lon-
don at war work. She belongs to the group
of the Women’s Legion and was one of the
first women motor-drivers attached to the
army. Her sister, Mrs. Guy Miller, was
widowed early in the war.
Major Harrison, our flying chief, is going
to England about August to present his
knowledge of Australian conditions in avia-
tion. The Major’s pretty young wife (she
was a daughter of ex-Labor-leader Prender-
gast) does a bit of flying and quite a lot of
soprano singing for Red Cross shows at the
Chirnsides’ neighboring place. And once a
week she entertains all the boys at the Point
Cook school. Usually there are about 30 in
the school; as soon as they are through
that and become cadets, they are passed into
the reinforcements camp alongside. One of
the fine lads who are now pacldng their kits
at the camp is young Noel Eedy, only son of
the general secretary of the Mutual Life
and Citizens’.
Two S. Australian women—Mrs. M. E.
Vaughan and her daughter Nancy—are tell-
ing feminine Melbourne how they did their
bit on the land in Wales. It was at
Pwllyrhywyhard ; and the farm was as diffi-
cult to work as it is to spell, for the soil had
been neglected for two generations. Nancy
has a fetching photo of herself in farm cos-
tume—felt hat, shirt, riding-breeches and
leggings. A putty-colored smock and a mac.
completed the outfit. Mother and daughter,
with 19 students, tackled their job in the
depth of winter. The girls worked with
picks and axes to clear the land of briars,
bracken and stragglihg hedges, and fertilised
it with 18 tons of manure which they wheeled
in barrows from the barges in which the
Welsh colliery stables sent it to them. At
last they had 16 acres under oats, wheat,
spuds, swedes and mangels, and the kitchen-
garden sprouted peas, beans, lettuce, onions,
carrots and parsnips. The girls drove 14
miles to get their seed spuds, which had to
be cut and limed before they were interred.
Seventy guineas was paid for two cows, and
the first milking lessons were given on
dummy animals fitted with rubber teats.
Mrs. Vaughan’s forewoman is now in charge,
and she herself is on furlough in South Oss,
where she owns an orangery.
Lady Helen went to visit the girls at the
Commonwealth Clothing Factory, where Bill-
jim’s uniform is made. The girls there have
formed themselves into a regiment, and wear
a real khaki uniform consisting of tunic,
very short skirt and leggings or puttees.
They tuck their hair into khaki caps with
a special cap-band, and when they march
down the street with their band pacifists
crawl into drains and die. At the parade
General Sellheim remarked on their good
marching; but when they did some bayonet
practice the plump officer squeezed' himself
hard against the wall- There was some
chaffing; on which the General explained
that bayonets, unless skilfully fixed, have a
habit of shooting off and striking like a
javelin. However, no harm was done. We
didn’t even lose a General. And Heaven
knows we have enough—of one sort and
another.
Melbourne has a new knight whom nine
out of 10 of us never heard of. Shortly after
the war started a little man named Higgins
got into touch with Prime Minister Hughes
and showed him what a splash he could
make as the saviour of the metal business
from the German octopus. Hughes didn’t
know anything at all about either metals or
the octopus; but Higgins and Robinson and
Baillieu kept him supplied with fireworks.
In return, Higgins, who was a metallurgist
and has made some money at mining, has
been made a Sir of some sort. The others—
well, you mustn’t ask me how f/iey’ve been
paid. Perhaps they are just patriots who
would scorn any payment, direct or indirect.
What with having to interview people all
day at the office and spending half the night
entering up his diary, Solicitor-General
Arthur Robinson finds it impossible to con-
tinue the simple life at Sandringham. The
family has therefore pulled up stakes and
moved into a flat at Cliveden.
A new style of hair-fixing is now being
adopted by some of Melbourne’s most
earnest searchers after ultimate quaintness.
It is in the Buster Brown manner. One
shakes out one’s flowing tresses, lops them
off. in a straight line across the back of the
neck, cuts a fringe in front, and with a
little trimming around the ears the thing
is done. No hairpins or switches are needed
—only a good, hard brushing every morning,
to get the hair standing out properly, and a
touch of tonic now and then. The seeker
after quaintness must have thick, wavy hair
to get the right, effect, or there is a serious
danger of acquiring an appearance like a
saddened water-spaniel ; but some girls come
out of the ordeal looking five years younger.
At the sale of objets d’art belonging to the
late George Stoving the taste of a connois-
seur was apparent. “Piccadilly George,” as
his club pals dubbed him, was of Austro-
German extraction, and married banker
Blundell’s daughter Sophie. Their flat at
the Rialto, Collins-street, was a joy to all
art lovers. Stoving died before the war, and
his widow has been living at Macedon for
some time. Her brother, Martin Blundell,
was killed lately in France, and sister Patty
is a war nurse. Another sister, Mrs. Will
Camming, died last week after an operation.
Linda Byron Moore is the only reported
casualty from Captain Conant’s cinema
offensive. In the garden-party scene she
slipped, the result being a sprained ankle and
enforced rest for several weeks. But she
is again on active service with the Mayoress’s
Patriotic League, at the Town Hall. “His
Only Chance” has roped in £lOOO so far for
the Red Cross,, and Footscray and Colling-
wood have not yet seen the Naicest in their
Mary Pickford and Theda Bara stunts. It
should be rushed at “a tanner a time.”
Dr. Horace S. Waters, who has just taken
up duty as a resident at the Melbourne Hos-
pital, finished his medical course brilliantly.
He is the survivor of a family of three boys.
One of them, Lieut. Leslie, was a Duntroon
cadet, who was hurried off to Gallipoli,
where he fell. The other, Lieut. Gordon,
fell in France at the end of last year.
Mrs. Leslie Stuart is lending her house for
a big party on July 10 to help the 2nd
Field Artillery Brigade Comforts Fund.
The widow of late American Consul John
Bray has come back to Melbourne by devious
ways from Johannesburg. She was a Mel-
bourne girl, Winifred Crabbe, a kinswoman
of the English poet Crabbe, and very popu-
lar and pretty. Now she’s furnishing an
admirable example of how charmingly weeds
can be worn.
The Fire Station made a demonstration
last week to entertain the Gaud Mayor, his
lady and all the councillors and their women-
folk. The brigadiers went through all sorts
of fire-drill and exercises. A bit of their boxing
rather startled the Naicest when it brought
vulgar red slaughter-house blood into the
scene.
Mrs. Jackson, the young, impulsive bride
of a naval man, has returned from an excit-
ing journey to Japan and Yladivostock,
whither she ventured on a surprise visit
to her husband. She was detained in one
port as a spy while the authorities investi-
gated her story. They interrogated the Cap-
tain, who, quite unaware that his bride was
not safe in Melbourne with mother, said
he had no wife in Russia or Japan. So the
lady was interned until her bewildered hus-
band discovered the facts and had her set
free. She was then packed on to a boat and
landed eventually in South Africa, consigned
to a brother. The wanderer has reached
home again with two big cases of curios and
big-game skins and a library of adventure
stories. They were all told at a welcome-
home dinner at St. Kilda last week.
Fan Dango Mackay had all her matinee
girls to lunch at Menzies’ last Wednesday,
just before she dashed off to Westralia to
join hubby.
The council-room at the Town Hall was
packed with Importance last Thursday when
all the suburban mayors and mayoresses con-
sulted with the Gaud Mayoral couple on
Red Crossing. The excitement was intense
and every niche of the big room was occu-
pied. All the worry raged round a sugges-
tion that the suburbs should rage on set
days of their own and leave the big button
day free for the city. The fight still con-
tinues. Most of the suburbs won’t willingly
hear of it.
“Home Fires” is the name of the latest
patriotic bazaar. It was opened on Tuesday
of last week and is to do business every
Thursday afternoon for an indefinite period.
Melbourne Mansions is the spot, and Mrs.
Dunbar Hooper, Mrs. Joseph Levi and Mr.
Edward Fitzgerald are the heads.
Mrs. Baird made a great success of a
patriotic concert and party at the Mia Mia
last week. Blind violinist Foley Westwood
was the chief stay of the programme.
A noteworthy item in the new report of
the Purple Cross Service is that the work is
nowadays only being continued in Victoria,
although in 1914 Maude Harvie was allowed
by the Defence Department to go and start
the movement in Sydney, Brisbane, Adel-
aide and Newcastle, and made good begin-
nings in each place. This hardly seems fair
to Australia’s war-horses. Thusfar, apart
from bandages, dressings and various other
items, a total of £2OOO in cash has been sent
along to France for drugs, instruments and
divers horse-comforts—described by Head-
quarters as “a magnificent effort.” Within a
month of the outbreak of war collections of
cash and materials were begun by Miss
Harvie, without any knowledge of a similar
movement started in London. It was the
Troop Horse Fund in those days. The lady
is still secretary to the service, but she has
handed over part of her old job to Cvril
Armstrong, of the Victoria Horse Bazaar,
who is looking after the treasury.
A wofd or two from Adelaide:—
The Charles Hornabrooks have news of the death
of their eldest son, who was only 18 when he
enlisted in the A.I.P. in 1914. For a time he was
with the R.F.C., thence to the Leicester Regiment,
with whom he did “special” work. He was over-
powered by gas at the end. A younger brother is
on his way to the Front.
George Cowan of ours has been induced to take up
the work of Assistant-Commissioner of the Comforts
Fund in London. He has been on various jobs for
the soldiers since the beginning of the year. Last
time I heard of him he was in France.
Salute St. Peter’s College! About 1000 of its
scholars have rapped at the door where the khaki
is handed put—“the finest record in Australia,” says
Canon Girdlestone. The school has one V.C., nine
D.S.O.’s, and 36 Military Crosses (five of them with
a bar) to its credit.
One of our returned men, Private Thomas, was
taken prisoner by the Germans, and at Aix-la-
Chapelle met Wilhelm’s hopeful. The Crown Prince
that day didn’t maintain the family habit of Fright-
fulness. He passed around cigarettes, with his
monogram on them, and “spoke kindly” to the
wounded. “Aye,” whispered a kiltie to Thomas;
“but dinna smoke the fag. Ah wouldna be sure it
is na poisoned.”
The Navy League has been deservedly admiring
itself this week. During the past 12 months it has
collected £6650 for the boys in blue in the Aus-
tralian Navy.
W. J. Sowden, president of the Art Gallery
Board—he has just got the long-talked-of title —
struck the happy idea of showing the public what
the Original collection looked like away back in the
early ’eighties, when it filled one small room. The
show was made at the opening of the winter lectures
which help to attract the public to the occasional
evening opening of the present Gallery-—a success-
ful experiment in this City of Culture, spelled with
a C.
Frank Murphy, grandson of late Speaker
Francis Murphy, has persuaded the Murray
Puckle widow’s only daughter, Dorothy, to
change her name. Fianc6 Frank, who is
a nephew of the John Grice dame, got a
gunner’s commission in the Fog, and is here
on leave. (Some people have all the luck.)
The next bride-elect is Adye Russell, ex-
banker Charles Russell’s daughter, who sends
word from London saying that she has
booked for a wedding with a Lieut. Waller.
Betty O’Hara is accepting congratulations
on her engagement to a Toorak Stodart, who
is now en route for the war.
Jean Coffey, a decorative singing girl who
has appeared in J.C.W. shows, is admitting
her engagement to a Mr. Osborne who came
down from the Malay Straits to enlist. He
is in Liverpool camp, and Jean is getting
ready for a Sydney holiday as soon as she
can leave mother and the Collins-street flat.
A unique wedding will happen shortly.
Both he and she have seen three years’
active service, are officers and wear decora-
tions for special services. The romance
budded on an Australian hospital ship, when
he was being invalided home early in the
year. He is Major Macpherson; she, Matron
Strickland, Royal Red Cross, who formerly
ran a private hospital in Sandringham, and
has been on the Kanowna from her first trip
■ —a capable, sympathetic and most tactful
administrator.
Captain Stubbins, the returned blind
soldier who married the youngest De Lissa
maiden, has put u‘p a beautiful home in St.
Kilda-road. The bridegroom’s father is also
fixing up his hero son with a country place
to grow pigs and chickens on.
D’you remember Ruth Bannister, the
clever young wood-carver who did such
beautiful work here? (Lady Denman and
Melba were delighted to have her stuff
in their homes.) Ruth went to old England
just before the war to perfect her art; but
as London has put aside its taste for all
those things she decided to do her bit in a
munition-factory.
Meynell Withers, the 16-year-old son of
the late Walter Withers, has succeeded to
dad’s palette, and promises to use it with
considerable distinction. The youngster
hangs 21 of his efforts at Bernard’s Gallery,
Collins-sti v eet, and already shows a gift for
picture-making that triumphs over juvenile
disabilities. His largest canvas, “Early
Morning in the Bush,” is an agreeable com-
bination of dark gums, green earth and
cobalt skies that wouldn’t disgrace a more
matured student. His smaller sketches,_ bits
of farmyard and treescape, with occasional
peeps of sky, might be considered sombre in
tone, but they reveal a fine bias for greys
which is an admirable basis for an artistic
education.
Marie Tempest had a Royal box on Satur-
day night to watch Graham Browne in
“General Post.” Marie showed an acreage of
grey fox-fur mounted on a big comfy royal
blue velvet coat. Mrs. Geoffrey Syme was
penned opposite with Mrs. Johnston. Graham
Browne looks fine in khaki, but just beauti-
ful in lovely brown mufti with a purple
anemone in his button-hole and a purple hem
to his brown silk handkerchief. Lizette
Parkes wears her perpetual smile and girly
frocks; she is at the dictatorial flapper age.
Her dressmaker goes in for Georgette, even
for morning appearance—pale shades and
big wide dark sashes- Miss Morrison, as
Lady Broughton, spreads expensive furs and
severe gowns.
Yours sincerely, JOHANNA.

HOW TO MAKE A GOOD
NON-POISONOUS COUGH MIXTURE.
To avoid the.dangers attendant upon the giving to children of cough mixtures
containing such habit-formin '- cn'mn drugs as paregoric, laudanum and morphia,
parents will be well advised if they make their own family cough mixture from
HEENZO (registered name for Mean's Essence), which is a compound of non-

A SAFE PROTECTOR
ABORIGINAHTIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES-LINSEED OIL
Y.Z.”: When the dredging co. started at
’Tween Bridges, the one-time populous Chinese camp
was already in decay, but about 15 Chows remained,
hatters all, pigging in as many small huts. After
eight months’ operations the dredgers came in con-
tact with the camp, and began to cut out the soil
about it. Eventually the cluster of tumbled resi-
dences stood precariously on a sort of peninsula,
almost entirely surrounded by slurry, and every few
days another hut, its supports eaten away by the
hydrant, tumbled into the pool. In each instance a
distressed Chinaman, clutching at a few rags, fled
to another homestead, still safe for a few days from
the encroachments of the dredge. Bailes, who man-
aged things for the co., often interviewed the China-
men, and advised the removal of their villas to more
stable estate; but John’s facial expression was'
always the same, one of clay-like incomprehensibility.
“Wha’ for?” he said. Came a day when the entire
inhabitants of the camp were driven into one lurch-
ing bark-and-slab hut, and here they herded for 48
hours, while the water devil still pursued them.
Again Bailes called, and aidvised retreat. “Wha’
for?” they said. The land was panning out hand-
somely, and Bailes had to consider his company. He
got the constable up from White Plat to talk com-
monsense into the heathen, but “Wha’ for ?” was
all Coleman could get out of John Chow. “If you’re
goin’ on wid this,” said Coleman, “ye’ll take me
advice, ’n’ have some sthrpng men handy. Thim
Cboinese will get at ye when the worst comes to the
worst.” Bailes had been feeling uneasy on this
score. He took Coleman’s advice, and quietly filled
the dredge-house with husky men armed with pick-
handles. Then the hydrant got to work again, gnaw-
ing the gravel from under the overcrowded hut, the
sole remaining relic of the Pekin of ’Tween Bridges.
Presently the peninsula swayed a little, then softly
settled down. The hut fell to pieces, and 15 passive
resisters came sprawling into the sludge, washed
about a moment in the eddies, before finding their
feet. Then, inches thick with slurry, they waded to
the rock where Bailes stood prepared for the worst.
“Wha’ for?” they said and went away.

“Copabella”: Re bush therapeutics. In
the battling days I was operating a slaughter-yard
for “stags” and other game at an out-station on a
Riverina squattage, miles from a dispensary or a
lodge-doctor dispute. One day a strange bullocky
arrived for a load of skins. He was nearly all-out
with a fierce influenza cold. I prescribed hot honey-
mead (the nearest we could get to the real thing) and
a good sweating-out under our combined nap overlaid
with a green pelt or two. Bill accepted, but prayed
for a dewy night as better than all such amateurish
stunts. That item in materia medica was new to me,
so I ventured no opinion. By luck the Lprd sent
an early-winter heavy dew that lay over the pad-
docks like a hoar-frost pall. It was the dampness of
it in my whiskers as it drifted in through the tent-
V that woke me. Outside, tramping through the
longest and wettest grass, was Bill, clad in nothing
but his shirt; and he had risen direct from under
the sweat-pack. I asked him if it was suicide he
was doing, but he assured me a bare-foot tramp
through a heavy dew was the" surest cure for a cold—•
it “drew the congestion and inflammation down from
the head and chest and out through the soles”!
No. Bill didn't die. I got a busli-vvire from him
only the other day, from somewhere out on the
Lachlan.

-“W.H.E.”: J. 11. M. Abbott’s recent
Bulletin yarn, “Point Piper,” reminds me that that
delightful harbor-front was my home-soil more than
half a century ago. In those days the abos. pitched
their numerous .camps from Rushcutter’s Bay to
Vaucluso, and they made a do of it on bandi-
coot, ’possum and rabbits, which were in abundance.
To look at Bellevue Hill to-day it seems incredible
that Norman Lindsay’s native-bear lived in serene
security there so recently. Cranbrook, Until a few
months ago the State Governor’s residence, was then
occupied by Capt. Bobbie Towns, who employed a
fleet of schooners recruiting kanakas for Queensland
sugar plantations. These niggers were billeted in
Cranbrook grounds, while the original owners of the
soil were camped in the adjacent bush, and the
frequent dinkum skirmishes between the rival colored
clans afforded us white kids lively excitement. Pro-
bably Hookey Walker’s ghost still roams o’ nights
round Bellevue Hill and South Head-road, hut there
remain no niggers above the soil to tell the story of
his exploits. In 50 years all traces, ril the abo.
camps have vanished from the landscape.

“J.F.K.”: During the recent Rockhamp-
ton flood a photo in a frame with glass front had
curious company. Whilst the waters were rising in
the house, a 2ft. black shake’ squeezed in between
the photo and the glass, • A fortnight-later, when
found, the. framed devil was still alive and ready to
bite anybody.
PRIDE OF PLACE.
SNORTY : “They’re yelling ter us from their

SPARROW: “Let ’em. They’re narked ’cos
we’re giving ’em our dust.”

"No, on, my boy, you mustn’t threaten to do things like that even if he did hit you. You

“Gam! You don’t know anything about it. He hit me on the nose.”
“MeXorth”: Another man has settled on
the land up here. .Seventy .miles south of Gape
York, a high point with ml-earth sides that make
good long-distance landmarks juts into the waters
of the. Gulf of Carpentaria. Just round the point
a. tiny creek trickles a passage through the sand and
mangroves; and relieves the monotony of miles of
unbroken beach. It’s about the loneliest spot imag-
inable. The nearest white man is 50 miles away,
and the only evidences of human beings are glimpses
of occasional pearJing-luggrfs and the distant smoke
Of wandering. Binghis* fires. Yet' half a mile up
the creek there is a white Settler, a returned soldier
and a man of good manner and address. He started
his struggle with the stringybarks and the solitudes
a few months ago, and already has a respectable area
cleared and a portion planted with peanuts. His
idea is to plant a considerable acreage of the nuts
and run the resulting fruit to Thursday Island in a
small boat for shipment south. It’s going to be a
mighty single-handed task—-Binghi in that part is
shy and not inclined to hear a hand —and Billjim
knows it. But courage and enduring hope are promi-
nent factors, in liis make-up. Take off your hats to
this man who, having fought and suffered at Gal-
lipoli, did nqt wait for tardy efforts at repatriation,
but got going on his own. The Far North wants

“F.Y.Z.”: In reply to “Wee Bobbin,”
who asked some tropical horseman what , causes the
“swamp cancer” which attack’s horses’ pasterns in
the Solomons, I venture to blame leeches. These
gentry are uncommonly addicted to battening on
horses, and the bites soon develop into a sore like
the tropical ulcer which, often from the same cause,
afflicts people in the same localities. The .trouble
is fairly common in N.Q. The best cure is to put
the nag on leechless ground for a bit—say, dry
steny ridges. Incidentally, a short course of leech
treatment is a capital thing for a horse whose legs
are badly filled and sore.

“Poddy”: Enter W. 11. McGown, of
Madalya, South Gippsland (Vie.), for the Veteran
Splitter. Stakes. As a boy of 13 he began his first
contract splitting laths for the mines about Ballarat,
and since then he has done some big jobs, notably
two separate contracts each of 100,000 4ft. pickets
for Rossiter and Salmon, or Eumeralla estate, Hedley,
and one of 10,000 6ft. posts for the same firm. These
he did single-handed. Now, at the age of 66, though
retired and comfortably off, he cannot desert the
Bush, and still splits palings for pastime and cheques
to invest in War Loans.
“Two Seas”: Never knew until yesterday
that some horses are addicted to the Early Victorian
habit of swooning. Just ahead of my team was a
lady driving in a sulky. A steam-tractor fizzed
round a bend of the road, and the sulky mare dropped
to the ground as though struck by lightning. The
driver arrived there simultaneously. I hurried up
and administered first-aid by loosening her corsets
(the mare’s) and pouring the contents of my water-
bag into her ear. But it was a good half-hour before
she came to. Her owner informed me that the mare
always fainted .when alarmed. I advised her to
carry smelling-salts in the feed-bag.

beer): “Pray don’t mention it, my deni'

“Paul Cupid”: Tell “R.S.” (B. IG/5/TS)
that this is the real speedy method of tanning kan-
garoo or other skins. Get two gallons of water at
98deg\, or blood-heat. Put therein two quarts of
bran. Immerse the skin in this and stir with a
stick for a quarter of an hour. 1 Then pour into the
water 4oz. sulphuric acid and again put the skin
in. (It is important to stir it round and lift it
out of the fluid frequently, so that all parts may be
equally acted on.) lAfter another quarter of an
hour, take the pelt out and hang it up to drain and
dry in the shade. When nearly dry, manipulate it
after the manner of an angry woman washing out a
pair of dad's moleskins without a washing-board.
When thoroughly dry brush the bran out of the hair
and you have a tanned skin as soft and pliable as
the lobe of your best girl’s ear.

THE OVERLAND MUG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We were breakin’ at Glen Helen, Billy Blake, and
Burke and me,
And, though I’m the one that says it, we were pretty
good, we three.
I could ride the horse they gave me, Billy Blake
could sit his own,
And Burke held the flamin’ record —none had ever
seen him thrown.
Jimmy Burns was amblin’ southward with a little
bunch of colts.
At the Hergott with a newehum-lookin’ chap he’d
got in holts—
Found him down, and done, at Druncan’s, where the
juice is dear and strong;
S j he picked him up, and fed him, and packed him
right along.
He was simple, to the limit, had a sheepish sort o’
grin; ,
Blit the way lie pulled our corduroys was nothin’
but a sin.
You’ve seen a feller foolin’ round a partly-handled
horse,
And expected every minute he’d be kicked to death,
of course.
He was one like that, but more so, and said Burke
to Burns at last:
“If he was mine I’d tie him up in camp and keep
him fast.
He ain’t got half the sense of any foot-high kid at
school,
He seems to me a dilly-billy, boss-eyed blanky fool.”
The chap heard this and sniggered, and said: “Burke,
I’m green enough ;
But ,there isn’t any calk for you to be so ruddy rough.
I’m city-bred and foolish in the bush I don’t deny,
And, p’raps I can’t sit buckers, but, b’ gosh, I’m
game to try.
IHi all you say, in one way. I’m a silly sort o’
bloke;
I was on- the booze a fortnight at the Springs and
now I’m broke.
It d suit you fellers better when y’ know a feller’s
down
I\ot to tell him he’s a softy just because he comes
from town,
But to say: ‘Cheer up, old party, here’s a bit of hair
and hide—
Jimmy Burns ’ll come a saddle; chuck y’r legs
across and ride.’ ”
“fake y’r pick,” said Burke, “there’s twenty decent
horses in the yard;
Any one y’ fancy, catch it, colt or filly, nothin’
barred;
Only this I’m stipulatin’, an’ it’s not too much, you’ll
own,
You must sit the one you’ve chosen, round the yard,
and not be thrown.”
Jimmy Burns explained it later. They were then
a mile away,
Simple Simon sittin’ solid on an outlaw yellow-bay:
“I tried to give the office, but you wouldn’t listen,
Burke, (
That chap s a top-notch rider, as you’ll notice bv his
work.
You’d ’a’ been a horse in pocket if you’d let me
speak my piece—
He's just through a contract breakin’ for the South
Australian P’liee.

LOGICAL DYSPEPSIA TREATMENT.
IMPORTANCE OF ELIMINATING
ACIDITY AND FOOD FERMENTA-
TION.
During the last two or three years reports
have frequently appeared in the press con-
cerning the remarkable value of bisurated
magnesia as an antacid and its ability to
relieve most forms of digestive and stomach
trouble arising from acidity and fermenta-
tion has often been demonstrated. Until
recently chemists could supply bisura te<l
magnesia in powder form only, half a tea-
spoonful of which, taken in a little water
after meals, almost instantly stops all fer-
mentation and neutralises acid, but sufferers
will be glad to learn that they can now
obtain this excellent remedy in the form of
5-grain compressed tablets, two of which are
equivalent to half, a teaspoonful of the origi-
nal powder. These new tablets of bisurated
magnesia can now be obtained of chemists
everywhere, in handy pocket flasks contain-
ing 60 and 150 tablets respectively, and it is
certain that they will prove as popular and
as efficacious as the original powder form of
bisurated magesia, which of course is still
obtainable.— Advt!

‘C. Coral” : The list of duties of the Gov-
ernment teacher in the Torres Strait islands as given
hy ‘Smokehouse” (B. lf/2/’18) is a fair one, but he
is in error in saying' that the job is run by “married
men only.” Two of the teachers are bachelors
(one, Jack Bruce, of Murray, has stuck to his iso-
lated post for a quarter of a century) and two
others are widows. _ But what about the island
policeman? He is supposed to report to the teacher
twice a day, look out for visiting boats and make
reports thereon, chase up stray mongrels for which
the Is. dog-tax hasn’t been paid, see that all children
and girls are in their respective villages at the stipu-
lated hour at night, hunt up truant youngsters and
collect the fines, inform the teacher of all sick cases,
run messages, and do a few other things. For all
this ho gets cl per annum, paid half-yearly, with
a couple of sticks of tobacco a week, and a gorgeous
uniform of heavy blue cloth with red facings (for
a tropical climate!). The job isn’t rushed, usually,
tthen a vacancy occurs in the “force” the new man,
as a rule, has to be threatened into the uniform.
* * * „
“A. Fisher”: Pass to “Morwang” (B.
9/5/’ 18), who wants a cure for the sting of fresh-
water catfish, these remedies: Ammonia (not cloudy)
and Rocky” Vane’s or Morrissey's snake-bite antidotes.
The first-mentioned will give relief, but the other
two will banish the pain instantly if applied at the
rate of a drop at a time in a few skin-deep incisions
in the vicinity of the spiked spot. By the way, can
any Abo. solve the mystery of why catfish out of the
N. S. Wales Western rivers are sweet-eating, while
those in coastal streams taste like stale mud ?
* * * *
“Chloc”: “Mick Anick” says (B. 9/5/’18)
that he had a paw-paw tree which .bore only male
flowers, but that he induced it to bear female flowers
also by driving iron nails into the stem. This
surprises me. I have never found a paw-paw to be
bi-sexual. Usually they are found growing in pairs,
male and female vegetables. I should be glad to’
hear if any botanist has come across a bi-sexual
specimen, and, if so, where. By the way, paw-paw
is pronounced in the East Indies “pa-pi-a,” hot “por
por” as in Australia.
*.* * *
Poddy”: I can’t allow that the bronze-
wing pigeons are a better lead to water than galahs.
They fly low and fast and are soon out of sight.
The galah, on the other hand, flies slowly and above
the timber, and is easily seen and followed. Oiie
peculiarity of the pigeons is that they always settle
50 yards or so from water and'walk in. They also
walk out before rising.
THE GE NTLE SEX.
THE WORM : "Miss Smirk, you take a mean advantage of your sex in calling me a coward
for not enlisting. If you were a man I should strike you
MISS SMIRK : “Yes, and if you were I should strike you hack.”
“Britt”: “Yairs,” drawled Billjim; “the
Aussie surgeons can give ’em all points, but there
was one with 6ur mob that did some wonderful
stunts. One of our blokes had most of his innards
blown out, and the doc., who had been repairing our
wounded by fitting ’em with parts of animals, shoved
some sheep-innards into Digger’s pouch and sewed
him up. Everything righto. The bloke lambed in
six weeks! ”
** v * *
“Shepherd”: It’s wasting time trying to
poison crows. The black devils, being scavengers, are
provided with two gizzards or stomachs, one being a
storeroom and the other a digestive organ. When
anything poisoned is swallowed it is passed up before
it can enter the second gizzard. When doped flesh is
swallowed, the poison is separated from the meat, and
the latter passes on to be digested. Thus the crows
can neither be poisoned nor starved by poisoning the
food in their vicinity.
* * * *
Radio”: Recently in Edinburgh I came
across a picture of a group of New Britain native
police, wearing sailors’ caps and ribbons. Memory,
stretching back over four lurid years of war, reminds
me of an incident which deserves to become Aus-
tralian history. In 1914 I was in Rabaul when we
were making some preliminary experiments on the
gentle Huh in those parts. The first day’s fighting
resulted in the arrival on board 11.M.A.5. Australia
of a large number of captured native police. They
were armed with German rifles dated 1912 (fine
weapons, too) and clad in about 1-1 yards each of
blue calico held up by a belt bearing the charac-
teristic German legend, “Gott mit uns.” Their
headgear was a wide felt hat adorned with a circular
badge .of red, white and black. Although they had
fought bravely and fearlessly against our troops on
shore they were simply terrified at the lowering 12in.
guns of the battle-cruisers. However, a square meal
soon built up their confidence in the benevolence of
the British navy, and the next day Commander
Jackson convinced them that King George was a
more better feller king than Kaiser Wilhelm.
Thereafter their loyalty was unswerving. Any sug-
gestion that they were Germans was met with indig-
nant denial. Six of them were dressed in white
navy clobber and caps, and the senior man was made
a chief petty-oflicer and decorated w.ith a medal
struck for the occasion from the lid of a tobacco-
tin. His pride knew no bounds. The half-dozen
formed a whaleboat-crew fit to propel any admiral in
the navy. The remainder of the prisoners were
clothed in a very modish garb obtained by draping a
pouple of yards of red target-canvas around their
middle, ■ topped off with white caps. The corps did
excellent service in policing the captured territory
in the name of his Britannic Majesty, and evidently
are still doing good work. They were nicknamed by
the sailors “Jackson’s Light Horse.”
A MATTER OF PAGE.
OLD LADY: “I suppose your present deplorable condition is the result of fast living?"
DEPLORABLE PABTY : “No, madam, I am simply a victim of the cursed ‘Go slow ’ policy ”
Machete”: Ike Billjim had been a pawn-
broker’s assistant, and when it came to settling down
again his grateful countrymen started' him poultry
farming in a small way. Among his stock was a
pedigree hen, and one day Ike called on the friend
who had presented her and said the fowl was going
to sling in her marble. Expert investigation showed
that the poultry wag only broody. Ike was presented
with a dozen eggs and the usual advice. Interro-
gated later, Bill gave the strength of it. “She done
all right. There was a dozen young ’uns, but I
drowned ten of ’em, two being as much as I reckoned
the poor old etcetera could look after.”

Pharmo ’: “H.V.E.” mentions (B.
9/5/’18) that chewing nutmegs is a bush cure for
boils. I warn him to chew with caution, as nutmegs
contain a poisonous active principle. Although the
amount used for flavoring in cooking is perfectly
harmless, deaths have been caused by chewing the
nut. A single nutmeg is sufficient to cause the death
of a man. The amount of myristicin (the poison)
in nutmegs seems to vary considerably, as while some
nuts have a high content value, others are free from
the principle.
* * *
“Rangan”: Can’t back up “Dugout’s”
statement that strychnine won’t kill swine, but I
know that the versatile goat is. immune to the
poison. One rainy season at Yeppoom (Q.) all the
goats of the district used to camp under my shop
verandah, and persuasion- being ignored, I slit some
bananas, put a fair dose of strychnine into each and
benevolently fed the flock. Then with a few stones
I set them off along the cemetery road. Next morn-
ing on opening the door there was sweet William
with his overstocked harem waiting for the next
issue.
* * *
“Silas Snell”: The Hurdsfield rush dumped
a mine in almost every back yard in Ballarat West.
As a small boy I drove a whim that left room for the
shaft and legs, jambed into a corner, and for the
cottager just to scrape out of her kitchen door. The
horse I was driving was a skittish mare, altogether
unfitted for the demnition grind, but experienced and
sedate neddies were rare. One day my brute, starting
. f aul to ° abruptly, caught the big, wooden bucket
in the top of the set in the mouth of the drive below,
and rushed such a strain on the rope that the recoil
sent her toppling off the elevated whim-ring, crash
through the kitchen-door on to the breakfast. Having
trodden the table flat and scared the family into a
kind of madness, the mare tried to jump out through
the window. She got her forelegs and head through
all right, and there she stuck. The braceman, myself
and seven men who came over the fence endeavored
to t v the rest of the mare out through the window,
and a fit of equine hysteria followed that ended in
tK- -hole end ing torn out of the wooden house.
My charge, escaping from the wreckage, fled like the
heathen in his blindness through half a dozen fences,
and brought up in a butcher’s yard. Resenting tins
intrusion, the butcher’s dog fastened on her, and the
mare opened out again and fought her way on to the
Star of the West, which wag situated in Anderson s
late cabbage-beds. The mare rushed on to the built-
up whim brace, dived into the hauling shaft and
remained wedged across about 9ft. down. It took a
good while to attach ropes and haul the ill-advised
animal up again. When she was brought into day-
light and hung clear of the shaft, still fastened to her
muzzle, wagging his body in a fury of zeal, was the
butcher’s brindle bulldog.
* * * •
Bouragi”: The scrub-itch mentioned by
Pick’ (B. 9/5/’18) is caused by a tiny red tick that
seems to be met with in all thick scrub, especially
in the tropics. It is one of the everyday afflictions
of Papua, and strong carbolic soap is" there the
favorite remedy. A dip or two in sea-water will
also abolish the irritation. Much worse than the
scrub-itch is kurri-kurri, another horror of the Papuan
scrub, caused by a burrowing insect. This beast
goes deep and lays its eggs in the flesh, horrible sup-
purating sores being the result. These if not taken
at once are hard to cure. A series of sulphur baths
is the only reliable thing I know of.
* * * *
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Some years ago while
an old shingle-roofed house was being dismantled at
Lower Lawrence (N.S.W.) a white snake was dis-
covered in the roof. It measured about four feet in
length, and was a rich cream color underneath. The
Sydney Museum experts could only suggest that
absence from the sun and light for a considerable
period brought about the bleaching.

“Iron Pot”: This is wliat I know about
Iluon pine. “Tombstones” made of it are
still extant at the old convict cemetery in
Macquarie Harbor (Tas.), weathered by the
storms of 80 years, but untouched by decay.
The ketch Royal William, built of the wood,
ran for over 60 years out of Hobart, and
for years • carried the mails to Maoriland.
Huon Pine coffins, dug up in an old Hobart
cemetery in the course of drainage opera-
tions, were found to be sound and undecayed
after more than 70 years in wet ground. In
1868 Walker’s mill-wheel at Hobart was
overhauled, and was found to be as sound as
the day it had been erected 4S years before.
It remained in action for many .years after.
Also Huon pine contains an ’essential oil
which is said to be a powerful germ-killer.
Have any of our numerous Governments
time to see about an afforestation scheme
with this remarkable herb in a prominent
place ih the foreground ?

“J.F.H.” : The story of Spiers and Pond
is one of the commercial romances of Mel-
bourne. They started a small restaurant
some 60 years., ago .-at the top of Bourke-
street, afterwards migrating to the front
premises of the Theatre Royal, which they
christened the Cafe de Paris, and converted
into Melbourne’s most luxurious dining-
palace ; also they went in for railway refresh-
ment-room contracting, and as an advertis-
ing side-line brought out the first All-
English Eleven and made a lot of moiffiy out
of it. Melbourne* then became too small
for them, and they transferred to Ldndon,
where they speedily revolutionised the eat-
ing business, acquired numerous hotels, rest-
aurants and refreshment-rooms, built Lon-
don’s first underground theatre —the Cri-
terion —and started a universal emporium
that now covers the greater part of. Ludgate
Hill under the shadow of St. Paul’s. They
left half a million. Then the huge business
passed into other hands, and for some years
it has been in difficulties through unwise
developments and risky “Empire Hotel”
speculations at seaside holiday resorts. Thus
one way and another the co. came into the
hands of a liquidator, who has just circu-
lated among shareholders a complicated and
not very hopeful scheme of reconstruction.

“Globe”:. “Murkah” (B. 1/11T7), Mdio
says that Marconi was the first to telegraph
without wires, is only more or less right.
Dr. O’Shaughnessy, in 1849, succeeded in
passing intelligible signals across the
Hooghly, 4200 feet wide; but the power
necessary to do it was so great that he
dropped the idea. In 1594, Rathenau, of
Berlin, signalled electrically through three
miles of water. As “Murkah” says, Marconi
pieced things together. He was the lucky
man. His chief discovery was the greater
the frequency of a current the greater the
magnetic field. He got along so nicely that
a couple of years later The Times printed
an. optimistic article prophesying that, when
his system was perfected, it would be quite
possible to signal as much as 30 miles!

“Ornis” unleashes the fighting caterpillars:
Is “Fax” (B. 2/5/’18) sure of his facts when he
says that " the' idea' of establishing the sericulture
industry in Australia is utterly futile? His remarks
will come as a great disappointment to the many
hundreds of enthusiasts in various States who are
desirous of helping to promote an industry which
should in time make Australia independent of foreign
silks. To castigate the unselfish work of the officials
and members of the various sericultural societies
because one misguided person incorrectly reeled off
the silk from a comparatively small number of
cocoons, is, in my opinion, decidedly unfair. I hold
no brief for either the N. S. Wales or the Victorian
. silk-culture societies, but am a member of both and
‘am well aware of their hopes and aspirations. The
main idea is to make silkworm growing a cottage
industry-— * side-line that any man, woman or ’child
can undertake by devoting a very short time - every
.day for six to eight weeks only each year. Should
people go into the business on a large scale, it is
their lookout and risk, and any failure cannot be
laid at the doors of the societies, ffjhere are at the
present time thousands of boys and girls in
Australia who each rear from a few hundred
to several thousand silkworms every year. They are
wasting their time, because the worms are.mongrels
and the food wrong. 'For the same amount 1 of work
they could be rearing pure-bred caterpillars on proper
food. Thus in addition to earning a yearly-increasing
amount of pocket-money by selling the cocoons, for
vdiieh there is an unlimited market, they would be
assisting to build up an undertaking of national
importance. Both purebred eggs and plants of
white mulberry are easily obtainable from any of
the sericultural societies and at a very small ex-
pense. The contention that Morus alba is a slow-
growing vegetable is fallacious. Even here in Tas-
mania, with the most temperate climate in the Com-
monwealth, its growth is surprising, provided proper
treatment is given. The silk industry has failed on
more than one occasion before owing to the experi-
ments being conducted on too ambitious a scale.
Those responsible for the present attempts are strenu-
ously endeavoring to avoid and profit by previous
failures.
“Suwarrow” : At a recent “patriotic” gar-
den f§te an allotment of land, which was
represented to be at the corner of two roads,
one of which was made, was auctioned and
sold for about three times its value. On
the purchaser applying to the donor, an
estate agent, for particulars to enable her
solicitor to prepare a transfer, she found
that thd allotment was not at the corner of
these roads, but fronted an unmade road
about' a quarter of a mile away. Being a
lady, the purchaser refused to argue, made
the Red Cross a present of the purchase
money, and there the matter dropped. This
sort of thing, however, Ls not going to en-
courage patriots to bid at future patriotic
auctions.

“Sr” : A leading architect in Melbourne
is in mourning for a fiver. One Saturday
a stranger, well-groomed, and with a pair of
race-glasses strapped round his shoulders,
called in and said he had been referred to
that office by a fellow racehorse-owner. He
held some land at Caulfield, and wanted , a
12-stall stable erected, not to cost more than
£lBOO, and, adjoining the stables, a small,
up-to-date villa. The stranger fixed on one
plan, and asked if the architect could meet
him on the site on the following Monday.
He explained that he would have preferred
to go that afternoon, but he had a horse run-
ning and expected to win most of the cost of
the buildings with his dead cert. He casu-
ally asked the architect if he was averse to
winning £5O. A fiver at 10’s would be a
quiet bet. The architect bit. Now he’s
kicking. Moral: Always dress the part well.

“Cobba Cobba”: A case of boots was re-
cently landed in Townsville (Q.) from Syd-
ney, with wires and seals intact. The con-
signees! 'had been bitten before by taking blind
delivery of apparently sbund cases ; so they
called for a check of the contents. This re-
vealed the case to contain four empty boot-
boxes, and a fifth in which the gay pilferer
had left his own discarded bluchers. Still this
experience wasn’t as bad as that of a Mel-
bourne. importer of magnetos. He found his
ease nicely packed with bricks ; but as the
Customs reckoned the exchange might have
been made at an Australian port, they de-
manded (and got) payment of duty on the
original consignment.
* * * m
“Oldfield”: “Bion” (B. 9/5/’18), in reply
to “Bombardier,” says “on the ordinary pas-
senger trade the passengers do not pay a bob
a head for shortages.” He is quite correct.
Still someone must come to the poor ship-
owner’s rescue to make good the deficiencies,
so he calls on the humble stewards. Until
18 months ago all stewards and cooks were
levied a bob a month, and, in the case of
one co., five bob. even if the stocktaking
proved all correct. Those were local condi-
tions; but. fig usual, the oversea cos. were
on a still better wicket. Among the
souvenir-hunters on the Western Ocean (Liv-
erpool to New York) the stewards have had
to pay as much as 7s. 6d. per head to square
the collectors’ thefts.
* J * * *
“Reggie Rubberstamp” : A few months ago
the staff of a certain Government department
in Sydney was enlarged and pounds’ worth
of printed matter was prepared to enable it
to take over the victualling of certain ships
running in the interests of the Commonwealth
Government. The books and papers prepared
were beautifully elaborate—about the most
elaborate set of the kind in the world, I
should say. All the boats have now been
transferred to another management (still
under the same Government control, how-
ever), and the elaborate Swede Turnip Books,
and Condensed Milk Cost Sheets; and Dead
Sheep Tallies, and beautifully bound Purser’s
Instructions are being dumped. Business
management? Win-the-War economy? My
oath! We’ve put beggars on horseback,
and you know where they ride.

“W.H.E,” scowls: —
He was a decently dressed and apparently honest
tradesman. Birdie, three months married, answered
the bell. The busy visitor explained that he came
from Bloggs, a plumber in the city, and had
been sent to alter the gas-fittings. “Oh, yes; come
in.” said her Innocence. He lost no time. “In
which room would Mr. Brown like this newly-
invented 60-candle power burner?” he inquired.
‘■The study? Ah, he must have intended this special
burner for that purpose.” The workman promptly
dismantled the solid brass brackets and cut-glass
gas-shades and substituted flimsy lacquered and
gaudy-colored rubbish ’ and common “fish-tail”
burners for the modern inverted incandescent.
“These,” lie explained, “were temporary.” He would
be back in half an hour; he had left the scintilla-
ting chandelier at the railway station. Then he
packed up £5 worth of fittings. When hubby came
heme and the visit was explained to him he said—-
well, let it go at that.

But on some quiet evening I might dance upon his
grave.

When people praise him 1 concur, for that’s the easi-
est way.
When business is business —well, ve • traders can’t

But in my strongroom I would .cheer the passing
hence of Boggs.
He sows blind Hate who is too keen, and, though 1
smije and smirk,
I'u love to leap upon friend Boggs and choke him
at his work.
Ho trimmed me on that deal in cheese— but I’ll nip
him in tea,
And then my dear old business friend will burn to

Pleasant, ’tis to idle
By this , summer sea.
Through the gold day noting,
On the waters floating,
While they Call and call again,
Birds that rise and fall again,
A-living of their sweet lives, and as happy as can be.
Pleasant ’twere to idle,
Easeful limbs outspread,
If one’s single duty
Were to worship Beauty,
Bidding life rejoice again,
Came there not a voice again
A-calling of the heart and hand to up and work for
bread.
11l it is to idle
By this summer sea
Till the daylight darken.
Since one needs must hearken
Tides that ebb and flow again.
Winds that come and go again
A-doing of their day’s work, and as busy as can be.

RODERIC QUINN.
The Inky Way.
“Copy Boy”: The Phewsion has decided
that a publicity-agent in the Prime Minis-
ter’s Department is essential, if the war is
to be won, and has induced B. S. B. Cook,
for many years Melbourne Her Aim's Federal
roundsman, to take the job. Whatever
opinion may be held of a Government that
requires to be boosted as if it were a
circus or a cure for chilblains, pressmen all
over Australia will wish Bert Cook the best
of luck in his new billet, for nobody has
worked harder or more unselfishly in their
interests. As sec. of the A.J.A. in the days
when it could not afford a paid official, and
when some ink.slingers had qualms about being
identified with so revolutionary a movement,
Cook was invaluable. When it grew to be
a power, he still labored strenuously, and
with Letche and Brickhill prepared the jour-
nalists’ case for the Arbitration Court.
Nowadays he is president of the A.J.A., and
still embodies a great deal of its shoving
power.
Author-journalist Alf Buchanan is back
in Melbourne, having parted company with
Brisbane Daily Mail, which gained in dig-
nity and influence under his editorship.
Buchanan, who is also a barrister, is think-
ing of turning his attention to Costs. In
his spare time he will probably continue to
write novels —it’s a habit hard to break.
Farmer Whyte, of the S. M. Herald, follows
him in Brisbane.
* * * *
“Dikast” : B. S. B. Cook’s departure from
journalism to fill a public-service job comes
most inopportunely; for the very existence
of the A.J.A. is threatened by mass
attack, and its units are being sniped in
more than One office. The man concerned
in the latest Melbourne dismissal had seen
nearly 16 years in his paper’s service, and
had received repeated promotions. But he
was one of the two men in the office who
had given evidence before Isaacs on behalf
of the journalists; and the brethren are
simply overborne by the suspicion that the
two circumstances are in some way con-
nected. : ■

Launceston Daily Telegraph has just
weathered a storm. Whitaker, Gunning and
Co. had announced their intention of shut-
ting up shop * but friends came along and
John Gunning’s leaders will continue to fall
upon Launceston like yesterday’s pancakes.

“O.B.”: L. Dmnas, late of the Argus,
whom Hughes included in his retinue to
England, ns the young man who accom-
panied William bn his expedition to War-
wick (Q.) and wrote up the subsequent
crime of the Egg with harrowing details.
Dumas, who is a fervent admirer of Hughe's,
owns a unique picture-gallery of all Low’s
cartoons in which the Great Man is the
central object. Hughes has autographed
every cartoon—bar one. This is the well-
known “Acquitted Without a Stain,” deal-
ing with the Watson bribery charge. Even
Dumas has never had the nerve to ask
Hughes to sign that one !
Harry C. Maddison, chief sub. of the
Argus since 1911, has left the paper, and
is succeeded by R. W. Jones. Maddison has
been one of the best men in the Conservative
daily’s office since 1599 f with a break on
S.M.H,), when he quitted Maoriland jour-
nalism to gO on the rounds in i Melbourne.
Jones, his successor, hails from Bendigo. For
some years he was mining reporter, and has
served a long and sound apprenticeship in
the sub.’s room.
The Bulletin’s old friend “Bill Bow-
yang” now finds himself, with Charlie Bar-
rett. of Melbourne Herald and the Camel
Corps Ambulance, on the staff of the Ivia-Ora
Coo-ee, whose No. 1 was lately published
at Cairo. “Bill” himself chats of souvenir-
hunting. During the battle at ■ Solium one
of the boys found a Crusader’s sword. Not
being a souvenir-hunter, he broke the almost
priceless relic in halves, and used the two
portions as fireirons. Military badges are
keenly sought by collectors. The rarest is
the crossed axes worn by the members of the
Constantinople Fire Brigade, who went into
action against the Anzacs at Silvia and
proved themselves false alarms. “Bowyang”
lias known one of these badges to change
hands for £lO.
* * -* *
“Gareeda”: Frank Boland, one-time Mel-
bourne pressman, with a career extending
round the world, is wielding the sword of
fancy and the pen of fact in France with
the Flying Corps. After being wounded on
Gallipoli, he was on Headquarters at Cairo
and Lotidon. Invalided home he was patched
up ih Sydney and sailed for the North again
last August. Having spent some years in
France when he was younger, he is rather
in demand now.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Inky Way’s a pleasant way
To those who are content
To see it as a glowing ray
Across the firmament.
A way of cheer it seems, but.those
Who brave it know a title that goes
In dark and devious shoals, or flows
In cavern dim where drift the men
Who never hope for light again.
A sea of pitch, the Inky Way,
Where few stars gleam a while,
And o’er its oily surface play
Strange glimmers to beguile.
Great steamers burn across the deep,
And yachts may twinkle, galleons peep ;
But many tramps in shadow creep,
And thousands toil, poor, blind machines,
In noil-ascending submarines.
If you in happiness would play,
And know your pleasant rest,
Go not along the Inky Way,
Which currents wild infest;
Whose tides the lawless winds distort,
Where rarely comes a ship to port,
And he is blessed in some sad sort
WTio all unmired from its black roll
Keeps one white corner in his soul.

[COPY OF CIRCULAR TO SHAREHOLDERS.]
The Broken Hill Proprietary Company
LiniTED.
Your Directors have for some time past been giving serious consideration to the matter of capital-
isation of the Company, in view of the altered conditions brought about by the Company having embarked
upon the Iron and Steel Industry.
Only a few years ago the Company was chiefly a mining proposition, while now it has become one
of the largest manufacturing undertakings in the Southern Hemisphere, with infinitely more money
locked up in capital than was the case under the old conditions. In view of the immense enlarge-
ment of the operations the whole position is changed, and re-capitalisation has become imperative.
The Directors consider that the large sum at credit of the Reserve Fund accounts ought not to
remain where it is, but should be transferred to capital, where no one controls it but Shareholders
themselves. This and other considerations have caused the Board, after' consultation with counsel and
the Company’s financial advisers, to formulate a scheme embracing the issue of the remaining
unissued authorised share capital of the Company, and for capitalisation of undistributed profits for
submission to the Shareholders at an Extraordinary Meeting to be held on the 10th day of June, 1918,
and a Confirmatory Meeting on the 25th day of June, 1918, when it is hoped in the interests of all that
the scheme will be approved.
The details of the scheme are fully set out in the Resolution embodied in the accompanying
notice convening the Extraordinary and Confirmatory Meetings.
The shares are to be offered at £2 each.
The division of the 318,994 shares pro- rata amongst the holders of the already existing
1,181,006 shares involves in nearly every case a fractional interest. No issue will be made in respect
of any fractional interest, but shares representing aggregated fractional interests will be realised by
the Directors on behalf of the persons entitled thereto, and the nett proceeds will be distributed
amongst such persons according to their respective fractional interests as allotted and paid for.
A Shareholder holding less than four shares in the present capital will only be entitled to apply
for a fractional interest, which if applied and paid for will be dealt with as above-stated on such
Shareholder’s behalf.
The granting of rights in respect of fractions of a share was determined upon in order that all
Shareholders, however small their holdings, might participate directly in any benefits that may accrue
from the issue.
It will be observed that any shares or fractions of shares in respect whereof full
payment shall have been made in advance and on ob before the Ist August, 1918, will there-
upon participate in any dividend which may thenceforth become payable, inclusive of any dividend
which may be payable in the month of August, 1918.
The whole of the issue has been underwritten.
What the position of Shareholders would be, if the scheme is approved and carried out, may be put
shortly by comparing the new and old position after the balance of the capital (318,994 shares of Bs.
each) is issued by the example:—lf a Shareholder held 10 shares of Bs* each when the paid-up capital
is £600,000, in 1,500,000 shares of Bs. each he will, under the new arrangement, hold 14 shares of 20s.
each in the Company with a paid-up capital of £2,100,000. There would remain an authorised and
unissued capital of £900,000 in 900,000 shares of £1 each, which might be of material use to the
Company at some future time in view of the growing nature of its business.
With the completion of the above operation, the balances as at the 30th November, 1917, date of
the last Balance Sheet, standing to the credit of Profit and Loss Account, will amount to £234,965
11s. 9d., and the Reserve Fund accounts to £410,000.
Demands upon the Company’s Iron and Steel Works to comply with the requirements of the
Commonwealth and State Governments, and also of the Imperial Government, for steel rails and other
steel products have been so great that the early completion of the extension of the Works is a matter
of growing importance to the community, particularly in view of the continued restriction upon shipping
and the increasing difficulties of importation.
In the interests of Shareholders the Directors have thought it desirable not to make the issue of
the 318,994 shares of the originally authorised capital of the Company a public issue but to confine
it to the Shareholders, as they feel satisfied that the scheme proposed will be acceptable to all the
Shareholders. .
The consent of the Commonwealth Treasurer and the sanction of the Imperial Treasury has been
obtained to the scheme.
Subject to the Resolution being passed as a Special Resolution, the Directors propose to close
the Share Register at 12 noon on the 25th day of June, 1918, for the purpose of ascertaining the
respective proportions in which Shareholders will be entitled to participate in the new issue of shares,
and forms of application will be posted to Shareholders as soon as possible.
Moneys payable for the shares will be received by the Company at its offices in Melbourne, Sydney,
Adelaide and London, and on

Note.— The following notice is inserted pursuant to the War Precautions Regulations:—
The fact that the Treasurer of the Commonwealth has consented to the scheme above referred to is
not to be taken in any way as a guarantee of the actual or probable financial stability or success of the

objection to this issue. It must be distinctly understood that in considering whether tjiey have or have

ness of any scheme or for the correctness of any of the statements made or opinions expressed with
regard to them.”

1 INDIVIDUAL FITNESS.
This is the time when our people need to
be strong of muscle and steady of nerve.
Hysterical people are of no use in war-
time. When they try to help they hinder.
Fitness should start with the individual.
If you are run down and nervous, pale and
lacking in strength to do your part, you need
more blood.
If your hand, your thumb or foot trem-
bles when you try to hold it still, if the lines
are shaky when you write, if you have
tremors of your lips or chin, your nerves
need strengthening.
Proper food and a good tonic will keep
most people in good health. Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills for Pale People are the most
popular tonic medicine in the world, harm-
less, non-alcoholic and certain in their action,
which is to build up the blood and to restore
vitality to the run-down system. For those
who are failing in strength Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills are an ideal tonic.
“Building up the Blood” is a booklet full
of useful information. So is the pamphlet
on “Nervous Diseases.” They are sent free
on request by the Dr. Williams’ Medicine
Co., Box 594 G.P.0., Sydney. Your own
chemist or storekeeper sells Dr. Willianjs’
Pink Pills at 2s. 9d. per box, six boxes

A SPLENDID LOTION FOR THE
COMPLEXION.
SUPERSEDES ROUGE, CREAMS AND
POWDERS.
Many smart women are now dispensing
entirely with rouge, face creams and powders,
as they find that a simple lotion prepared
from 2oz. rose water, 2oz. flowers of oxzoin
and 1 drachm of tincture of benzoin gives
better and more lasting results at but a frac-
tion of the cost. Floxoin Lotion is the name
by which this remarkable preparation is
popularly known, and one of its great advan-
tages over other methods of beauty culture
is that it is so easy to use —you simply pour
a little on a sponge and then apply it to the
face, neck, hands and arms; when dry you
brush over lightly with a soft cloth or piece
of chamois leather, and your skin then has
a beautifully smooth, clear appearance and
your complexion a delicate tint which can be
attained by no other means. Moreover, each
fresh application tends to enhance your
beauty, for Floxoin Lotion has a tonic effect
on the skin and is therefore excellent for
enlarged pores and other blemishes — Advt.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Frank Tudor, Minister for Customs in
the last three or four Labor Governments
and now leader of the Federal Labor party,
says that “the Censorship is the worst-
administered section of the Defence Depart-
ment, and that is saying a good deal.” But
Tudor might add this: for one serious com-
plaint against the Censorship to-day, a dozen
complaints could reasonably have been made
almost any time that Tudor w T as a Minister
and Labor was in office. Tudor knew how
atrocious the Censorship was; so did other
Ministers. But only one of them, so far as
THE SPLENDID STY.
“In order that a sanctuary be created a sanctuary
must be broken down.”— Nietzsche, the German sage.
The Bulletin knows, ever protested against
it, and that was Hugh Mahon. The party
machine silenced all the rest Actually it
was while the Labor Government was in
office, and Higgs was Treasurer and Tudor
was Minister for Customs, that The Bul-
letin was cautioned and threatened with
prosecution because it denounced profiteer-
ing. So long as their crowd was in office,
what else mattered? Australia has to
thank Party Government for having had to
put up with the Censorship along with a
thousand other ills.
The N. S. Wales Labor Council has
decided in secret session, by 101 votes to 75,
that it won’t take part in any recruiting
movement. The bombing of hospitals by the
Huns and the fearful slaughter of nurses
and wounded and helpless Australian soldiers
seems to have made a favorable impression
on the N. S. Wales Labor Council.
THE CORONATION.
“German newspapers are enthusiastic over the suc-
cess of the Crown Prince’s attack on the Chemin des
Dames. They state that it was not only a demon-
stration of Germany’s unbroken offensive powers,
mt a dynastic victory for the Hohenzollerns.”
, There has been an error in cable-transmis-
sion. Russia has got pieced by negotiation.
Two days before Australia began to get
drenched with news of the latest German
advance, one of the Secretary for State’s
preposterous cables to the Governor-General
was published. It ran this way:—
If, however,’ the enemy should open his attack in
the immediate future, it will be at the disadvantage
of over-hastily made preparations.
That is a fair sample of the poisonous rub-
bish on which the Secretary for the Colonies
feeds Australia. This paper has repeatedly
protested against the publication of these
harmful messages, especially at a time when
it is supremely necessary to let the people
know the naked truth about our desperate
position. If the Secretary for the Colonies
doesn't realise that we still have to rely on
voluntary enlistment, and that this pap is
prejudicial to it, then it is time the Censor
attended to his job.
A M.L. parson who remarked the other
lay that “children should not sing God Save
the King,” and that he “hoped the war debt
would be repudiated,” ran into trouble full
tilt. The Court came to the conclusion that
he might be mad and was a dangerous per-
son, anyway. Then it said “Eleven months.”
They call it the Military Precautions Act over
there. What the Germans call it in Poland
has not been explained. Yet H. G. Wells lately
had an article in one of the most solemn
monthlies arguing that repudiation of war
debt would all over the world be one of the
great issues of the future : and Wells doesn’t
seem to have had his board bill paid for even
24 hours.
South Aus.., wanting an expert to advise
on the condition of its railways, has looked
for one in a queer place—the Malay States.
Anthony, lately manager and chief-engineer
of the railways in that part of Asia, has been
appointed to do the job, and has just arrived
in Adelaide to start work. He is an
English engineer who has been in Asia since
1910, except for a year when he was in the
Munitions Department in London. One
thing, at any rate, he can tell S. Aus. that
will surprise it: the whole 800 or 900 miles
of railway in the F.M.S. have been built out
of revenue. If he draws attention to the
difference between owning your railway and
paying tribute to somebody who wants his
pound of flesh no matter what else happens,
Anthony’s appointment may turn out quite
happily.
The Federal Government’s compromise on
the minors’ enlistment question is as hope-
lessly illogical as the whole voluntary sys-
tem. The parents’
consent is nominally
required because a
youth under 21 is an
infant at law, and
the parent is respon-
sible for him. At 19
or 20 the youth is
just as much an in-
fant as at 18, yet the
compromise makes a
difference between
infants at different
ages. Bruce, the new
member for Flinders,
made the sane re-
mark that it was
physical deficiency
that made lads of IS
unacceptable. That
touched the spot:
physical condition
and not number of
years is the real tes't.
“It is a grave mis-
take to send youths
under 21 and men
over 45 to the
Front,” says Bruce,
M.H.K., who as a
returned soldier
ought to know. It is
also a grave mistake
to have any Front;
but necessity causes
a lot of things. Mon-
tenegro until this
war made it a rule
not to call out men
under 18 or over 60
even in times of
stress; but in its
last-ditch campaign
against the Hun it
had to strain a point.
The Government
printing shop being
in the hands of the
enemy the latest de-
crees were only pub-
lished by word of
mouth, but 65 or 70
is said to have been
the , age limit. Older
men butted in at
their own risk.
The Brisbane Labor Council puts the mat-
ter plainly. It wants peace by negotiation,
with “no annexations and no indemnities.”
So the Hun will get back his lost terri-
tories in good condition, for the Allies have
committed no ravages upon them. On the
other hand Belgium, Serbia, Northern
France, Western Russia and a bit of Italy
will be returned to their owners with hardly
a house or a tree standing, burnt with fire,
stripped of everything of value that could
be taken away, littered with the dead bodies
of women and children and old men, and
with the industries that took centuries to
build torn up by the roots. And the beloved
brother who did these things, who made the
war, who charged Roumania £400,000,000
indemnity and Russia £500,000,000. and who
announced that the figure for Britain would
be £2,000,000,000, plus the loss of her depend-
encies—the beloved Hun brother isn’t to
pay, for his brother hereabouts is tender of
his feelings. Apparently the “brotherhood
of man” doesn’t include much sympathy for
the man who has been trodden on. It is all
reserved for the treader.
r As a matter of ordinary honesty the
N.S.W. Labor Council should now communi-
cate with the Premier of N. S. Wales and
tell him not to bother about the re-registra-
tion of the unions and the bill to deal with
the matter. The re-registration of these
unions was agreed to by the N. S. Wales
Ministers at the Recruiting Conference in
Melbourne, because Tudor and others said
that the unions’ de-registration had been a
hindrance to the Labor unions taking any
part in recruiting. Now the N.S.W. Trade’s
Hall has decided: by 101 to 75 not to take
any part in recruiting, anyway, which puts
Tudor in a very unpleasant position indeed.
And unless the N.S.W. Trades Hall writes,
to the N.S.W., Government, saying that it
doesn’t want re-registration granted under
such circumstances, it will make the posi-
tion of Labor leaders or alleged leaders at
future conferences extremely difficult.
GOT HIM.
“During April Britain and America built 40,000
tons more shipping than was sunk by submarines.
The number of submarines destroyed is increasing-
monthly. The total for May promises to exceed that
of April, which was a record.” — Cable.
UNCLE SAM: “Well, anyway, John, tee have
him well gripped .”
, The tale of what will happen to Australian
industries if they don’t get a Protective
tariff was told to the Inter-State Commis-
sion by the manager of Melbourne’s biggest
shop, Foy; and Gibson’s. The “existing situ-
ation’ has forced the firm to make, among
others, burr-crushing, warping, dyeing, brush-
ing, scouring and carding machines, and pat-
terns are being prepared for looms for fancy
and plain tweeds. They are also making
their own machine tools. All this is being
done here because they cannot get them
any other way. But—“after the war the
English people will beat us in prices, and
then w T e Will go back to the imported
machine.” And the people who have got em-
ployment at the job of building machines in
Australia will be able to struggle for an
infrequent job on the wharf, helping the
importer land his foreign goods. All his
wages boards and arbitration awards won't
help him then. To get wages' boards and
arbitration awards without a high tariff is
like making a present of a pint-pot to a
perishing man in a wilderness.
“Erraw”-: This is how returned men and
others are being encouraged to go on the
land. The price of chaff-bags in country
towns is 16s. per dozen, cash with order;
That is to say, for every ton of chaff cut for
market the bag bill alone runs from 325. to
405.! Result, thousands of tons of good hay
are rotting in the country, and the clearing-
out sale is nearly as common as mice. I
wrote to the price-fixing authority in Mel-
bourne, asking the landed cost of bran-bags.
Bead silence. Is there no responsible per-
son in the Commonwealth who can explain
this jute muddle, or who can find out what
profit the jute thieves of Sydney and Mel-
bourne are making and why they are per-
mitted to do it? Our primary industries are
being strangled—nothing less.
THE BUTCHERS’ UNION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The central empires shall devote all care to have
the armies fully prepared to enter any eventual future
conflict at their maximum strength.”
—New Austro-German treaty'.
Let us be strong for war! The future holds
A splendid promise for our cut-throat hosts I
Beneath our warlike banner’s ample folds
New blood shall flow as freely as our boasts.
The little war that we are waging now
Shall fade from memory in the years to come;
Linked in a splendid pride, we make the vow
Never to silence gun or throbbing drum
Till by the methods we have learned so well
This earth is a complete and utter hell.
There are some women up and down the world
That we have failed to turn to widows yet,
Some children sleeping with soft lashes curled
O'er eyes that sorrow has not vainly wet;
And boys are growing up with four stout limbs,
Unmaimed and unafraid. Shall 1 these things be ?
Prepare, prepare; and send Hate’s glorious hymns
To scare the babe upon its mother’s knee!
Slaughter shall pour as in a splendid flood
Through the great future. On! The word is Blood!
Nothing shall stay us! Peace is still accursed!
Let art and science and all trade decay!
Through us this sobbing earth shall know the worst
Is yet to come howe’er the years delay.
Whip up despair 1 Urge the keen torture on!
Ravish and bum and mangle hour by hour.
Our last thin veil of night is now withdrawn;
We stand alone for Butchery and Power.
Prate not of democratic claims and votes —
Our purpose in the world is to CUT THROATS !
There shall be wars and wars! Old Death shall reap
In wider fields' before the end is seen.
What odds that every German eye shall weep?
The world must know exactly what we mean.
What’s that ? The enemy at last may win !
Well, if he does we shall not be to blame. ,
We stand for war until they sack Berlin
And burn our proud Vienna up in flame.
While we remain it still is battle weather;
War and our shaking thrones shall fall together.

COMSTOCK’S “DEAD-SHOT” WORM
PELLETS.
A SAFE, SURE AND RELIABLE SPECIFIC FOR
THE ERADICATION OF WORMS IN CHILDREN
AND ADULTS.
The general symptoms of worms are a
tendency to pick the nose and a sensation of
itching in the anus. Other symptoms are
nervous affections, such as fretfulness, irri-
tation of temper, wakefulness or disposition
to excessive sleep, disturbed sleep, and grind-
ing the teeth, sudden starting out of sleep as
if from fright, dizziness, spasmodic move-
ments of the eyelids, dilated pupils, per-
verted vision, temporary blindness and deaf-
ness. General convulsions are not infre-
quent in children, and symptoms resembling
water in the head have been ascribed to
worms, and have ceased on their expulsion.
The long round or stomach worm is the
commonest kind of worm from which man-
kind suffers, and of a light, transparent
color, resembling the ordinary ground worm,
except that the extremities are more sharply
pointed than the ground worm.
Young people are more subject to these
worms than middle-aged or elderly people.
They live in the bowels, and sometimes make
their way into the stomach and throat, caus-
ing sickness, vomiting and choking. Gener-
ally one or two would be the most a person
would be afflicted with, but sometimes a
much larger number is met with. The length
varies from four to eight inches, but young
ones an inch to two inches long are also
found. The first thing to do is to rid the
system of the worms, and Comstock’s “Dead
Shot” Worm Pellets, taken according to
directions, are an effective remedy for the
thorough eradication of the long round or
stomach worm—the common enemy of the
child, the youth, the middle-aged and aged.
A light, nourishing diet, out-of-door exercise,
and, if possible, a change of air will greatly
improve the general health.
Threadworms or pinworms are of very
common occurrence in children. They are
very small, from one-sixth of an inch to half-
an-inch in length, and resemble cotton
thread —they are sometimes called seat
worms, and reside in the lower bowel. The
chief symptom of this worm is severe local
itching, restlessness and irritability, and a
frequent desire to urinate, picking at tlie
nose; loss of appetite and anaemia are also
observed. To get rid of the worms and their
eggs their nests also must be removed, and
that requires a specific remedy. Comstock’s
“Dead Shot” Worm Fellets, taken according
to directions, on an empty stomach, followed
by a dose of opening medicine, will succeed
where others fail.
Comstock’s “Dead. Shot” Worm Pellets
are packed with full directions, and
are - for sale by chemists and stores
generally at 3s. 6d. per packet, or six
packets for 205., and if unable to obtain
locally will be mailed post free on receipt of
price. Prepared only by The W. H. Comstock
Co., Ltd., 23 Lang Street, Sydney, N.S.W.;

QUALITY.
The public are not pressed to buy Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills because they are an All-British product, neither
are they urged to buy them because for the past fifteen
years they have been manufactured entirely in Australasia. These are no doubt very good
reasons why they should be urged on the attention of the public, but there is a far better one which
is the quality of the article. It is on the merits of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills alone that
they are presented to the public for their approval, and not because they are made in Australasia or
are British-owned, or for any other reason, however good it may be. They stand purely on their
merits as an effective remedy for all complaints arising from a disordered digestion, and they are
to-day more extensively used by all classes of the community than any other remedy sold in
Australasia. All classes of the community use them, male and female, rich and poor, young and
old. The merchant, the miner, the lady of society and the girl in the factory—they all find in this
remedy just what is required to keep the system in proper working order. Indigestion and
Constipation caused by improper or too much food or drink are quickly banished by a dose or
two of Dr. Morse’S Indian Root Pills. They are a safe, sure and reliable remedy
sold at a moderate price within the reach of all classes.

NOTIONS

SIMMONS

SPORTING
NEEDS
The track at Randwick on Saturday was
as fast as a skating-rink, wherefore the A.J.C. has to
make an alteration or two in the record book. Arch
Marella (Bst. lib.) hurried up in the Ellesmere
Handicap so rapidly that the clock stopped at “2.5,”
thus clipping tsee. off the main set by Biplane
(7st. 111 b.) and Woorak (7st. 111 b.). The best time
for six furlongs on the course was “l.llf,” by
Balarang (7st. 51b.) and Rosedell (Bst.). Poitrina
did as well on Saturday with 9st. 61b. Montcalm
(9st.) and Portrush (7st. 41b.) had each run a mile
in “37J.” -Laddie Blue, a Newcastle gelding, also
did it in winning the Novice with 7st. 91b., which
seems altogether uncalled for. During the afternoon
Lingle’s sister Pamphlet won over six furlongs in the
Nursery- with Bst. 71b. in “13i,” and old Jack Rice
perpetrated two miles over hurdles with 13jt. 71b.
in “42-J.” Altogether it was a day on which the
animal that hesitated on the mark or anywhere else
was lost.
* * * *
One of the smartest middle-distance handi-
cappers on Sydney courses came from Maoriland.
This is Arch Marella, a five-year-old gelding by
Marble Arch, owned and trained by J. Tuekerman.
To win three handicaps in successive starts at Rand-
wick in a fortnight is something that lias not been
done very often. To this performance of the awk-
wardly-named Arch Marella has to be added the
incidental achievement of setting up a new time
record, for a mile and a quarter. The horse first
came into notice at an outer circle meeting (Wyong)
in April, when, starting at evens, he won over seven
furlongs. On May 18, at 12’s,' and carrying Bst. 41b.,
he won Tattersall’s Stakes at Randwick from 20
others, running the mile in “401.” On the follow-
ing Saturday he was given a run in the Club Handi-
cap at Warwick Farm and ridden rather leisurely
finished second to Kenilera. Last Saturday he had
Bst. 21b. in the A.J.C. Ellesmere Handicap, among
the others being March On, Selandra, Promised Land
and Black Nut. Starting at 10’s he stayed behind
until the last furlong and then coming on at a tre-
mendous bat ran down the leaders and hit the line a
length to the good. On Monday punters had for-
gotten about him or reckoned he would feel tired or
something. Anyway, they inaugurated a boots-off
rush to get their money on Quarale (Bst. 31b.), Early
Morn (Bst. 81b.), Silent Way (Bst. 61b.) and Vaun-
tress (Bst.) in the Winter Stakes, a mile and three
furlongs. Arch Marella had been allotted 7st. 91b.
in this a couple of weeks before, and the crowd that
had backed him before got on again at 100 to 12. Again
the nag landed the bacon. Early Morn finished last.
He, too, lately won three races on end, but the
performance of the Maorilander was a good deal the
better. Someone had a very solid win.
* * * *
Recent form is usually the best thing to
watch with two-year-olds, but it was a good thing
to take no notice of in the Nursery Handicap at
Randwick on Saturday. A fortnight before, on the
same course, and from a bad start, the Newcastle-
owned outsider Queen’s Guard ran clean over the top
of 17 others, including Jennie 8., Pamphlet, Cragrose
and Myamley. This time the same nag was backed
like a certainty to do it again. Getting away with
a flying jump he ran in front to the turn and then
dropped right out. The rest of the proceedings were
conducted by Myamley and Pamphlet, neither of
whom in the previous race had at any time looked
like winning. Newcastle people won a hatful over
the first effort of Queen’s Guard and got rid of most
of it again over the second. They reckoned it a
certainty both times.
•** * *
The heaviest smack given to juvenile form
for quite a while was administered in Sydney on
Monday by Dick Meagher. This colt, which lobked
like a near-about champion in the early part of
the year, until Palm Leaf settled him, had been
having a holiday. On being revived he ran last in
the A.J.C. Champagne Stakes behind Outlook. On
May 18 he punctured at four furlongs in Tattersall’s
two-year-old Handicap under Bst. 101 b., after start-
ing a hot favorite, apparently on account of back-
wardness in condition. On Saturday, in the A.J.C.
June Stakes, with 7st. 71b. therei was no
backing for him at 25 to 1 and he ran well astern,
apparently still backward in condition. On Monday,
in the first mile race for two-year-olds of the season,
he had Bst. 61b. and unobtrusive? support at 12 to 1
in the ring. Either the previous racing or a quiet
Sunday had worked wonders with him: he was well up
all the trip and was running away from everything
else over the last two furlongs. He ran the mile
in 401. What he did to “students of form” Heaven
only knows.
* # * *
Assuming that the paddock machine had
been run on a basis of £1 tickets and a straight-
out dividend on the winner, the dividends paid at
the A.J.C. meeting on Saturday would have com-
pared this way with the prices on offer by the
books:—•
Tote. Ike.
Hurdles .. .. £6 18 0 6 to 1
Novice .. . . 5 8 0 3 to 1
Steeple .. .. 6 6 0 5 to 1
Nursery .. .. 10 10 0 10 to 1
June Stakes .. .. 10 6 0 8. to 1
Ellesmere Handicap.. 9 3 0 10 to 1
The weakness of such a comparison is, of course,
that the fielder’s odds are taken at the death. In
the Hurdles the winner was laid at 7’s and B’s far
more than at 6’s. In the Nursery 12’s were laid
before 10’s. In the June Stakes Poitrina went to
B’s from 12’s and 10’s. In the Ellesmere Handicap
the bulk of the money laid was at 100’s to 7 and 8.
For the Novice and Steeple the respective winners
were at 4’s and s’b most of the time, and this
is about where they would have been on the
straight-out machine. There is nothing in these
figures to convince the backers of winners that they
would get away with as much cash from the
machine as from the books. The arithmetic merely
gives substantial backing to the theory of this
page that where there is direct competition the
man who bets in big money will do business with
the odds-merchant every time. All the eloquence
on earth would not convince the man who took
100 to 8 Poitrina for the June Stakes and drew
£lOB from Paddy McCohen that it would have
been just as well to get £B2 from the tote.
* * * *
“Mujik” : Before the start of two races at
Randwick on Monday 1 was talking about the nags
with three very capable trainers, men who have been
in the business all their live? and are up against
horse morning, noon and night every day of the
week. About one race each had a different opinion
regarding the probable winner. About the other
they agreed that a specified animal seemed a cer-
tainty. Before those two races I heard a couple of
punters who know no more about racing than about
astronomy fiercely announcing that something was
already ’omeandried and would carry their bit. In
each case the trainer men were hopelessly wrong—
they didn’t even get a place. The cocksure and
ignorant pair of punters collected twice. Judgment
and brains may have more chance on a racecourse
than anywhere else; all the same, it seems certain
that if Luck has gone to rpost, the best of judges
will lose his socks as quick as the other kind. Per-
haps the only good judge of horse or anything else
is the one who knows when the Luck Bird is on the
moult.

A feature of the racing at Flemington last
Saturday was the return to usefulness of old Golden
Wire, one time at the head of the second class in
sprinting. The handicapper had let the gelding into
a six-furlong event at nearly 4st. less than the
weight bestowed on Whitefield. Six-seven was a
new experience for Golden Wire, and he celebrated
the occasion by beating the over-rated Omaha with
a final dash. The stable got 8 and 10 to 1 about
the light of other days. In the Hurdle Race old
Coronatus gave promise of a revival by running
second to Mountain God when never a penny was
on him, and in, the Steeple the rising reputation of
Dr. James received a severe set-back. The Dr. was
alleged to be a ’chaiser of great promise, and if it
hadn’t been his first time over the Flemington jumps
he would have started at a shorter price than 5 to 2
in a field of eight. But he couldn’t go as fast as
Artillery Bill, and he is no streak of lightning.
“Dale”: R. J. (“Johnnie”) Ogden was
employed at the Newport Railway Workshops in
those daj r s. One night he went to the Tivoli, and
going home with the boys he bought a saveloy from
a Swanston-street vendor. Fortunately it was a bit
the worse for wear and John felt too ill next morn-
ing to go to work. In the afternoon he recovered
and went to the races. He won £2OO, and since
then he has never looked back. To-day he runs a
fine business and a motor-garage at Williamstown,
and owns Lord Cavendish, which won at Moonee
Valley the other day. When Lord Cavendish romped
home at Warrnambool it meant four figures for
Ogden. Lately he was a buyer at the Sydney year-
ling sales. Moral: I dunno.

Robinson and Clark kept their small but
select string of horses, in Adelaide over the Birthday
Cup meeting. Magpie was not started in the only
w.f.a. event, but Elsdon won it for them, comfort-
ably, from Wee Gun. William the Silent was merely
among those present. Another non-starter was
Wedge, who had earlier in the afternoon gone out
first favorite for the big sprint, the City Handicap,
although his weight, lOst. 31b., had never been
carried successfully. Nor was it this time. Timms
the contractor, who is taking a big hand in racing,
won with Kingbier (Comedy King—Lady Lydia),
from Melbolt and Aislabie. The winner had net
been much fancied outside of the stable and paid £25
3s. The time. lmin. 26fsec., is record for the race,
and also for the distance (seven furlongs) in S. Aus.
* * * *
The stipendiary stewards in S. Aus.
(Hogan, Clem Hill and Tom Wigley) have been
so struck by an electric battery they got on the
track of, but which was smuggled back to Melbourne
when their suspicions became known, that they have
made a private trial at Morphettville with a three-
volt machine specially constructed. Contrary to the
experience of the stipes in Vic., it acted like a
charm. Either horse that carried it could easily beat
the other that didn’t.

At the last Bathurst Trots the Shea
brothers made the two principal events a family
affair, by piloting the three placed horses on each
occasion.
The skin of the head and neck of Carbine
has been stuffed and mounted for the Auckland
Museum. The Duke of Portland, who bought the
great racer, remindful of the fact that the horse
was bred in Maoriland, sent the skin to the Auck-
land Racing Club, but it was found impossible to
mount it in its entirety. So the taxidermist of the
Museum, Griffin, made a fine job of the “bust.”
Other portions of the skin will decorate a chair
in the club’s rooms. Melbourne Museum scored the
skeleton.

J. H. Leadley, who won the 100yds. (10
3-5 sec.), 220yds. (23 3-ssec.) and 440yds.
(52sec.) championships of Sydney ’Varsity last week,
is just now the speediest of Ma State sprinters.
Last year he graduated in the 100yds. (10 4-ssec.)
and 220yds. (23 4-ssee.) at the ’Varsity; and in a
handicap this year he was timed to do 100yds. in
“two yards worse” —the smartest time hereabouts for
a long while. Another bright performance at the
’Varsity meeting was R. S. Holcombe’s mile (4min.
43 3-ssec.). Holcombe won the half-mile (2min.
4sec.) and mile (4min. 43 2-ssec.) at this year’s
G.P.S. championships and was runner-up in the All
Schools’ heavy-weight boxing championship.

“Pick”: A once-famous athlete and any-
distance runner pulled off the track when half-caste
•Jack Brindle died recently at Bombala (N.-S.W.).
In the ’eighties, when foot-running boomed, he raced
on many grounds in Australia, and though always
from scratch was generally handy for the prizes. He
contested many matches for big a-side wagers against
Monaro cracks, and on a famous occasion, with G.
O. Baldwin, a Delegate flier, to whom he was conced-
ing five yards, he ran three dead heats for the final
of the Bombala Athletic Club’s £lOO handicap.
“Hawser” : At the Salisbury Plain camp
I was No. 1 of the Aussie tug-of-war team. Nine-
teen teams were entered, and we expected to give
the Coldstream Guards —the favorites —the tug of
their lives. Sure enough we met them in the final.
Always on the end of our rope (No. 12) was Private
Pat McGarry, a huge 15st. Gooriannana native.
All the big Brass Hats were looking on, and the
Tommy officer (Viscount Something) who bossed
the Guards’ team was just about It, with Charlie
Chaplin mo., gold-rimmed monocle and cute little
cane. The Aussies won the first pull and the
Guards the second. The final was a corker, but
the Ooldstreams shifted us, and a mighty British
roar went up as Australia was pulled across. Time,
13 minutes exactly. “Haw! Bai Jove 1 Knew
we’d lick ’em —British stayin’ powah, by Jove!”
piped his Nibs, when who should whirl in but
McGlarry. Putting his leg-o’-mutton fist on the
Viseount!s shoulder (we all thought Pat would get
shot) he shouted: “ ’Ere, mate ! Up with yer
dough. I’ll have a a lash at any of yer cham-
pions!” The Brass Hats simply shrieked.

Colin Bell left the steering-wheel of his
taxi on Saturday and argued the point with George
Cook at Sydney Hippodrome. Both are massive per-
sons and smote at one another with the force of
enraged mastodons. But Colin knew more about
evading trouble than George, and it was the Dubbo
lad who got most of the wallop. Some day Cook
may do better. For the present his only real assets
are great strength and courage. But he punishes
the air too much. Dave Smith’s judgment for Bell
was strictly according to the law and the prophets.

The first golf in Victoria, if not in Aus-
tralia, was played in 1849. When William West-
garth was going on a trip to Britain several citizens
of Melbourne put up two guineas each and asked him
to buy golf clubs and balls for them. The material
came to hand in May, 1849, and some games were
played; but the thing did not take on, and it lay
in the tomb many years before the resurrection.

Newcastle (N.S.W.) senior-grade cricket
final, which extended over six weeks, seemed on the
way to a record aggregate until everything collapsed
before the strong arm of Jim Wells, who took
seven wickets for 92 runs. Still, 1338 runs were
scored for 40 wickets, and the sheet was decorated
with four centuries. The world’s best aggregates
are 1911 for 34 wickets by N.S.W. against Victoria
and 1739 for 40 wickets by N.S.W. against Stod-
dart’s XI. Both were banged up in 1908.
* * * #
“Half”: The Bulletin’s cheers for
Christian Brothers’ College effort in winning three
matches in one afternoon must be renewed.' A
couple of weeks ago St. Joseph’s College let loose
six teams against King’s School, and won five
matches and the other was drawn. That is the
record in schools football so far as this observer
has noted—this season, anyhow.

Ten Maoriland Rugby Union reps, have

Dewar, A. J. Downing, D. Gallagher, E. T. Harper,

Henry Dutton, pastoralist and yachtsman,
of Anlaby (S.A.), has offered himself for khaki
without success. He was a great' oarsman at Oxford,
and he was, with Murray Aunger, the first to cross
Australia from north to south in a motor-car. But
the military doctors found au old leg-trouble a
fatal bar to active service.
* * * *
“Emma Ack Emma”: Recent mention of
old Ned .Trickett reminds me of months spent in
France with his son Jim. One of the hardest workers
that ever left Australia, he was also one of the
strictest disciplinarians. Probably that explains why
one of his gunners, returning from an estaminet
pretty well oiled, solemnly saluted a life-size crucifix,
respectfully adding, “Good—hie—ni’, Mr. Trickett.”

“Prince” Treeby (so called because his real
moniker is Albert Edward), in his time one of the
most popular boys at Scotch College, is back in
Melbourne with a lieutenant’s stars and the Military
Medal, which he won in France. He was a keen
athlete at school, and when George was here as Duke
of York, he handed his dad’s young namesake his
sports prizes at a public gathering at the Exhibition.
Treeby was champion of the college, and he got a
reception which nearly lifted the dome. That was
on May 14, 1901. Since then Albert Edward has
done some shining things for Brighton at cricket.

“Jimsey”: Let me gallop for the long-
dav’s-ride championship. Mum was seriously ill, and
dad, who was with cattle near where Murrumbateman
(N.S.W.) now stands, got word to come at once. He
lit out from camp at five o’clock in the
morning aboard a brumby, and reached home, about
seven miles the other side of Nimitybelle, between
seven o’clock and half-past the same night. He
weighed over 11 stone, and the horse was eight years
old. They covered the distance, roughly 115 miles,
in 14 hours, a good part of the wav hpi™ i.
the bush. And in the Monaro busl/is bush^ 0^
“Know Nothing”: Talking about distances

was never any good afterwards. But if anv
one wants a really breathless gallon let me
recommend a livery-stable horse without whin or
spurs and a trip from hyogle to Grey Villa The
distance is 20 miles. I am not too bad a horse
man, and I cut it out in 5$ hours. The return
journey was done in shrs. 55min. Two witnesses
will vouch for the time and also that I rode the
one horse throughout.

R. A. Martin, of Young (N.S.W.), handles
a shotgun fairly well. During recent Red Cross
sports at Old Lambing Flat he had a go at soarrnws
and starlings off the mark and killed 174 birds 151
with the first barrel and 24 with the second. There
were only 19 escapees.
* * * *
“Centurion”: It ought to be remembered
by “Le Nay” (B 16/5/’18) that when shooting up
or down hill with a rifle, less elevation is required
than when the object fired at is on the same level
as the shooter. Barometric pressure also affects fine
shooting more than most shooters realise. For every
inch the barometer rises or falls add or deduct 11
yards per 100 of range. Then there is temperature'
For every degree the temperature rises or falls in
the vicinity of 60deg. Fahr., subtract or add one-
tenth of 1 a yard per 100 yards range. Anyone who
takes a clinometer (to get his levels), a barometer
and a thermometer next time he goes ’roo shooting can
work out the details in case an animal comes a inner
and meet it in a scientific spirit. S ’

“Battler”: I think we topped the market
for fresh-water fish at the Wilcannia (N.S.W ) Show
social. A Darling cod, scaling 241 b., caught that
day, was given to the Red Cross. George Dempster
Australia’s baldest returned Billjim, got hold of it and
started to auction it. Tom Daskein, of Morden station,
(husband of “Tarella” Quin, not unknown to the
Inky Way), kicked off with a century. Joseph
Timms (of railway contract fame) was a good sec-
ond with £.25, and quarter-hundreds followed™ quick
succession from other wool-men present. The lesser
lights - also sparkled well until four hundred quid
was reached in half an hour—something over 20s.

“Nwyn”: The handiest remedy for a sting
from a flathead is some of the slime of the fish
smeared on the affected part. It cuts off the pain
immediately.

“Con Drew”: Dwell the box a second
while I try to wean “Jim Carew” (B. 23/5/’18)
from Murrumbidgee pool. Although he has “only
once seen it played off the level,” anyone who has
Studied at the green table will tell him that no
game lends itself more to the sharp. Highs and lows,
fins and deuces, despatches, longs and shorts, strip-
pers, mockers, Derwents, slitheries and top-siders
may all be rung in at other games on occasion; but
they are merely school-boy props, in comparison
with the deadly contrivances that are used at Mur-
rum. The chap that “Oarew” caught palming the
marble must have been spoon-fed. The dinkum
“wide worker” never palms; the work is done
inside the basket. IJas “Jim” never heard of the
squeezer, the roller, the smoked alley, the tube, the
double call-back, or the hold-back Peter ? The last has
a clip inside its throat, which pinches the 16 alley
as it goes in and holds it there until the manipula-
tor is ready to release it. Anyone who knows how
to make a Murrum basket behave can work it. As
to Murrumbidgee ever out-doing our national game
of two-up “Jim Carew” can have evens.

“L.S.” JUDHPORES, 25/-
TAILOR-MADE TO ORDER
TpHE Judhpore is a combination of the ideas responsible
for the production of Riding Breeches and Riding
Trousers of the usual design. With Judhpores you get
the fullness at the thighs and almost the same close fitting
at the knees as are features of Riding Breeches of regu-
lation pattern. No leggings are needed. The design
obviates the necessity of using laces or buttons at the
knee. The garments can be pulled on as quickly and
easily as ordinary Riding Trousers. You therefore get
also the commendable features of the latter.
There is no doubt as to the handiness of Judhpores, and
they have more than justified their great popularity in
Australia.
We quote our “L.S.” Special Judhpores in Military
Drills at 25/- tailor-made to order. Other materials are
obtainable up to £4*
SAMPLES ARE POST FREE

evident that a large part of the trade is done

Though the profits are a couple of hundreds
or so less than they reached just before the
war, the risks, so far as you can judge them
on paper, have been reduced: —
Liabilities. Advances.
1914 ..£106,349 £172,150
1918 . . 90,184 167,210
Capital is £75,842; add reserves, and share-
holders’ total funds are £95,512, or something
in excess of the liabilities. Liquid assets are
£13,842 ; deduct £2555, the half-year’s divi-
dend and bonus, and there is £11,287 net.
After setting that amount against liabilities
there remains £78,897 of debt, represented by
£J 67,210 of advances, and £7OOO of freehold.
All the advances are alive: there are no pro-
perties on hand. The position from the
depositors’ point of view is thus entirely
satisfactory. Shareholders have nothing very
gaudy ahead of them, perhaps. The time
seems past when concerns engaged in financ-
ing home-buyers could make very big profits.
But there is a respectable 6 p.c. for them, a
decent reserve fund to help them earn it and
to protect their capital, and a foundation for
increased deposits and potential profits. Their
risk is in having properties thrown on their
hands in the drab days that are coming. But
that is a comparatively small risk if adequate
margins are required ; and, anyway, Brisbane
will probably suffer less of a reaction than
some other cities in which war-loan moneys
have been spent more wildly.
* * * *
Just now, when tlys country is drunk with
paper money, it is apt to lose its head and
say that everything in the. garden is lovely.
It never had much foresight, and it seems to
be getting less. Still, iifthe hope that it will
do a bit of thinking, these facts are worth
repetition:—-
Notes are of no value except for transactions inside
Australia. Fifty millions of them wouldn’t buy a
loaf in London or pay the wages of a single Aus-
tralian soldier in France.
All our imports, except insofar as they are covered
by exports, must be paid for in gold. And we have
so few manufactures, thanks to low-tariffism, borrow-
ing, loafing and optimism, that we are dependent
on imports for even our railway rolling-stock.
The interest on our British and other outside
debts must be paid in gold and the amount is
enormous and steadily increasing.
The gold supply from our mines is growing
smaller as the demand increases. So is the gold
reserve in the banks. Here are a few figures:—
Coin in Banks.
June, 1913 .. £31,252,066
„ 1914 .. 36,410,024
„ 1915 .. 34,903,123
„ 1916 .. 27,800,790
„ 1917 .. 22,854,827
March, 1918 .. 22,503,612
Also about the means of replenishing the stock: —
Gold Yield.
1903 ..£16,294,684 1914 ..£8,729,949
1906 .. 14,631,745 1915 .. 8,270,339
1909 .. 12,604,509 1916 .. 7,074,673
1912 .. 9,879,928 1917 .. 6,155,837
1913 .. 9,376,573 *l9lB .. 5,245,382
*Estimate based on four months’ returns.
The return for 1918 will probably be unde;
£5,000,000, for the slump is increasing in velocity.
And no amount of taxation—not even an income tax
of 255. in the £ —would alleviate this trouble one
whit. It would only bring in more paper money,
and the foreign import and foreign interest liabilities
call for gold. Canada is differently situated. Thanks
to a high Protectionist tariff, less borrowing, fewer
strikes, harder work and much national pride, it has
become a large manufacturing country. It can
supply itself with almost everything. And in 1917
f it was actually able to export great quantities of
war munitions, iron and steel goods, printing paper,
motor-launches and other goods of its own making,
and sell them for gold. It has therefore no gold
problem.
* * * • *
The Westralian gold yield for April was
the lowest since that State became a regular
producer. Returns from every centre showed
a decline, and the total was barely half of
what it was a decade qr so ago.

Mary i? married
Jacks at the front
A ND the many happy evenings you used to
spend en Jamille are gone—never to return.
Even when Jack’s booming baritone once more
fills the house—he will miss Mary’s accompani-
ments. You know he never could get past ragtime.
In the meantime you and mother
are dreading the silent evenings of
the coming months. They stretch
ahead in a seeming eternity of
ennui. You have both so long de-
pended on the “youngsters” for
amusement that any talent you once
possessedyourselveshas rusted away
into uselessness. But there is a
way—the Beale Player way—to
realise all the enjoyment that you
think you are going to miss. The
“Beale” Player-Piano has every
attribute of the straight Beale-Piano
—including the steel tuning system
—together with a Player mechanism
of faultless technique. It also
excels in tone control. Thus it
enables anyone musically inclined
to give full rein' their musical
thoughts. On the “Beale,” one
plays almost instinctively—the
mechanism is so sensitive and
instantly responsive to the delicate
controlling devices. Informal
'concerts held daily.
Call and ask to hear a favourite composition
played the Bea/e-Player way. It will open
up a wonderful field of enjoyment for you

Churchgoer: Thanks; but half the parsons
in the country have now quoted Dennis. And why
not S’s Emma: Much obliged. But as a result
of pars printed and information supplied to the
Department, the rule relating to the deduction on
troopships . has been radically altered... Macque: Yes,
but what risks did the office carry during the period ?

don’t, and the survivor has to make good the loss on
these.... Vineleaf: None at all. You can get the
same result from bran... .M.L.L.: Identify contribu-
tions, and send with name and address to Account-
ant, Bulletin .... Jeanette: Your heart does you
credit, but try to understand that Bananaland isn’j;
all Australia. That’s all the correspondent endeav-
ored to point out. ., .F. G. de V. G.: You’ll never
help recruiting that way. ...M.C-.: Now give us the
name of this man “who was with The Bulletin.”

worked out as a subject when she does nothing but
rise?... .A.G,M.: The verse is not strong enough to

Is our motto of the man on the land-;
To show our great Overman
That we are the greatest of bands.
Now may our Overman be ; our judge,
To see that we .never begrudge;
And never tire but keep on the trudge,
And stick to our colors and never budge.

From “the Senior Sec. Y.M.C.A., Bagdad
area”: —•
One of your wireless boys vvrote, in The Bulletin
of January 24, that even the Y.M.C.A. had intro-
duced class distinctions now we had set up separate
(Quarters in Bagdad marked “Officers Only” and had
“shifted the piano out of the common room into the
new select quarters.” May I say that the accommoda-
tion for officers in our premises was made separate
from the men at the express stipulation in writing
of the military authorities? With regard to the
piano, this being the only one at our disposal and
needed for concerts, it was necessary to put it in a
Psafe” place, not because the piano—or the Y.M.C.A.
—had any snobbish preference for officers, but
because the efforts of some British soldiers at play-
ing “The Rosary” with one finger and a left hand
running accompaniment tend to be very damaging.
The more this paper hears about military
administration in Mesopotamia, the more
tolerant it becomes of military administra .
tion in Australia.

Grafton Bridge, Auckland, N.Z., said to be one of the longest masonry spans in tne world.
In
Cement and gravel are the principal
ingredients of most masonry bridges,
but it is necessary to have the expert
skill of the engineer directing the
practised hand of the workman before
results such as this can be attained.
If rubber and fabric were all that is required to
make a first grade motor tyre, there might be
less reason for preferring Goodyear Tyres.
But rubber and fabric are not all; they are
only a beginning. There is a third ingredient,
most important of all —and manufacturing
proficiency is as good a name for it as any.
Manufacturing proficiency, as applied to Good-
year, means the high degree of perfection
attained in manufacture, the exactitude with
which the combined labor of eighteen thousand
earnest workmen is applied upon the product,
the effective marshalling of all powers and
energies of organisation.
Even if other makers were disposed to employ equal
care with us in the selection of rubber and fabric, this
proficiency still would afford Goodyear Tyres a safe
margin of excellence.
A safe margin of excellence —there, in a phrase, is
the whole reason for the great and growing popularity
of Goodyear Tyres, sufficient to make them the
largest selling brand of tyres in the world.
If you have not already used them, you are denying
yourself benefits in comfort, mileage and satisfaction
that only such tyres can bring.
Benefits that you no doubt are paying for now, with-
out getting.
Goodyear Tyres, Heavy Tourist Tubes and “Tyre Saver” Accessories are easy to get from Goodyear Service Station Dealers everywhere.

Crude were the drugs and clinic ways
In what were called “the good old days,”
For science then was at its birth,
And what it taught was little worth.
They knew no anaesthetics then,
Nor means of storing oxygen ;
And what was just as sad, be sure.
They had no Woods’ Great Peppermint Cure.

Eight Good Points about the
COLO TYRE.
(1) TREAD. —Corrugated, presenting small surface to the road, thereby saving friction.
(2) TREAD.—A great thickness of rubber, which is practically cut- and chip-proof.
(3) BREAKER STRIP, which, being made of loosely-woven, heavy fabric, binds the
tread to the carcase of the tyre.
(4) PURE RUBBER. —Pure Rubber is placed under Breaker Strip.
(5) CARCASE.—Composed of five plies of heavy, long-fibre canvas, heavily impreg-
nated with rubber.
(<;) FULL Al R SPA Civ .
(7) SIDE WALLS. —Realising the severe work tyres are called upon to to do in the
country, we have placed a great thickness of rubber on the side walls, preventing
water from entering, as often happens in other makes of tyres after a few months
service. Other makes have very little thickness of rubber at this point.
(8) BEADS are heavily reinforced and skin-coated with rubber, to prevent rust.

George Buller, one of the best-known and
best-liked of showmen, is in a Melbourne pri-
vate hospital, and insists upon remaining
cheerful although he has just had his left
eye removed.
Elwyn Harvey (wife of showman Marks
and sister-in-law of George Marlow) intends
taking her talents to the TJ.S. with a view to
film work.
“Catheter”: As a sawbones I rise
to a point of order. Guy Bates Post’s per-
formance in “The Masqueraders” is good;
but John Loder’s death scene is a gruesome
absurdity. Having wadded himself pretty
solidly with morphia for months, he expires
under the cold scrutiny of the blue light. Now,
morphia is a narcotic, and death by it isn’t
a gruesome series
of gasps and grunts,
but peaceful^—a

ing inhibition of
all the bodily func-
tions ; drowsiness

thought of injecting atropine. Perhaps the
’Varsities in U.S.A. are shortening their
course and have cut out toxicology.
“Peter”: The interviewer who tackles G.
B. Post will nearly always find Mrs. P.
answering. It is Mrs. Post who tells you
that his favorite fruit is Havanas, or that
he, prefers Mozart to Mrs. Hemans as a
dramatist; and meantime the owner of these
delightful preferences lias only to sit back
and try to look worthy of the talents, tastes
and discriminations which Mrs. Post is re-
vealing with a fluency that never fails. Post
is alleged to have told a confidant once that
his wife was an encyclopaedia married to a
gramophone. Certainly what she says goes.
She is the Last Post, and if you are slow
with your opening query she is also the
Reveille■.
Ernest Wliitington, formerly dramatic
critic of the S.A. Register, and now its chief
of staff, has been recalling players and
others who made their first appearance in
Adelaide. Harrie Ireland, he says, first
came into notice by taking Myra Kemble’s
part in “Dr. Bill” on an emergency.
Florence Young made her first appearance
there, in “The Gondoliers,” and Dorothy
Brunton in a small part in “The White
Heather.”
“Glen II.”: John Bull’s play-censors
(there are two now) have been busy lately.
They insisted on alterations to “Realities,”
the Ibsen sequel to
“Ghosts” ; they fell
upon some of the
Rasputin legends;
they cut out lai'ge
slabs of business
and a number of
lines from a new
play, “The Knife” ;
and their very
latest is a refusal
to allow Grossmith
and Laurillard to
stage “Twin Beds”
under that title.
When the manage-
ment agreed to
alter the name of
the thing—which
is remembered here
as an innocuous
and dreary Yankee
farce —to “Be Care-
ful, Baby,” the
censors 'were satis-
fied that London

the box-office that would never have been

“The Oldest Inhabitant” sniffs the earliest
sawdust: —•
'The first circus, in Sydney was opened in 1841 by
an Italian acrobat, Delle Cassc, who exhibited two
Brazilian girls as tight-rope dancers and contortion-
ists, and a male performer on the slack-rope. They
appeared at the Victoria Theatre for a short season ;
afterwards Belle Casse erected a tent on a vacant
piece of land on the south side of Hunter-street, a
few feet east of George-street, about where Henry
Parkes later had his toy-shop. A couple of horses
were trained and the two girls were coached by an
ecruestrian named King. , But the circus did not pay,
s;i a. stage was added, and the Olympic Theatre was
born. The scenery was painted by J. Skinner Prout.
Malcolm’s Circus (he sometimes ■ spelt it Malcom)
afterwards became the Queen’s Theatre; it was in
York-street, a couple of hundred yards from Market-
street. The first circus in Melbourne was established
in 1840 pnder peculiar circumstances. On the south
side of Little Bourke-street, between Russell and
Stephen streets, was a vacant piece of land. Near
by was a notorious pub, the Horse and Jockey. One
Hayes selected the vacant land as a site for a can-
vas* pavilion, and by April everything was ready--
horses, lady and gentleman riders, ground and lofty
tumblers and such like. It was to be a Southern
Astley’s. An application was made to Superintendent
La Trobe for a license. This was referred to the
Magistrates, who refused it, mainly through the oppo-
sition of John Thomas Smith, owner of the Queen’s
Theatre. Hayes, not to be beaten, opened his circus
“free,” but each person entering had to buy a cigar
at 2s. fid. Thus run the place flourished for a time;
but it became disreputable, as the neighborhood was,
and the whole show was brought to the hammer.
It is pleasant to notice the persistence of
Tom Walls among London’s bill-toppers.
The new Gaiety piece. “The Beauty Spot,
provides Thomas with a droll and angular
part which allows him to exercise full free-
dom of speech. Another man with a pronn-
nent place in the production is Arthur
Whitby, who visited Australia with H. B.
Irving.
As his Australian friends expected, the
trick by which Chung Ling Soo. lost his life
in London was known as “Defying the Bul-
let ” The object was to appear to catch on
a dinner-plate bullets bred from two guns.
It is an elaboration of the old trick whereby
the illusionist caught in his teeth a bullet
fired from a pistol. Something went wrong
with the mechanism, which the real things
were not supposed to leave, and the slugs
tore into Chung’s chest.
“Fax”: The action for criminal libel
brought by Maud Allan and J. T. Grein
against Pemberton Billing was probably in-
stigated by political enemies not in the least
concerned about the “good name” of the
dancer or her manager. Ever since the early
davs of the war, when he charged the War
Office with disgraceful ineptitude in aviation
matters, Billing has been the bete noire of the
old Tory gang that he attacked. Of late his
newspaper, the Vigilante, was a little thorn
in their flesh. Its aspersions on a private
performance of Oscar Wilde’s “Salome,”
which was denied the Chamberlain’s license,
offered a chance to blot Billing out: convic-
tion would mean a considerable term of im-
prisonment for him. The lady had to admit
an ugly skeleton in the family cupboard,
“despite the protests of prosecuting counsel
that the question was cruel.” A man. is
brought to court on a criminal charge which
threatens his liberty and is intended to
ruin him, and when he proceeds to extract
some evidence which is of the first import-
ance to his defence, a hired bluffer calls him
a cruel man to cause the prosecutrix pain '.
The audacity of these horse-haired persons!
“Rangan” : A moving picture of a recent
Bananaland cyclone had a “leader,” “One of
the Heroes of the Cyclone.” Then followed
a picture of a young man leaning up against
a bicycle smoking his pipe. Being a hero,
his picture came in for some applause, and I
wondered what he had done. The screen
soon enlightened me —his wife and three
children had been drowned!
Fred Knowles, well-known in Sydney
theatrical byways, was in a couple of big
turns with Fritz last year and got home to
Aussie a few months ago with a haversack
full of trench humor. With pen and brush
he has now got together “With the Din-
kums,” a collection of 35 drawings of Bill-
jim frivolity, published by N.S.W. Bookstall
Go. (Is. 6d.). Knowles isn’t an Academician
but the humor is there. Nowadays Knowles
is front-of-the-house man for Recruiting-
Minister Orchard.
“Peter”: As a supplement to “O. Blin’s”
par. on the Ruhleben Theatre (B. 16/5/T8),
let me list some of the shows staged by the
prisoners with the permission and frequently
with the assistance of the German Govern-
ment. The first produced was “Androeles
and the Lion,” followed by “John Bull’s
Other Island” and “Captain Brassbound's
Conversion.” Then there were Galsworthy’s
“Strife” and “Silver Box,” Shakspeare’s
“Othello.” “Twelfth Night” and “As You
Like It.” Wilde’s “Importance of Being-
Earnest” and Ibsen’s “Master Builder.”
Among more popular plays were “The Pass-
ing of the Third Floor Back,” “The Private
Secretary,” “What Happened to Jones,”
“Mrs, Preedy and the Countess” and “Mary
Goes First.” They also did “Trial by Jury,”
a revue and a pantomime. The theatre is
in the Grandstand Hall of the Ruhleben
Racecourse, and has a generously equipped
stage, with footlights, dressing-rooms, scene
docks and everything else required. The
Teuton commandant and stall are regular
first-nighters, and allow one of the theatri-
cal committee a half-day off under military
escort when special costumes or props are
required from Berlin. We know these things
because one of the expert assistants at the
birth of the theatre was Professor Bryeeson
Trehearne, the Repertory enthusiast, of
Adelaide.
From the TJ.S.A.: N’Yark has a new
theatre, the Miller, opened with a brilliantly
artificial comedy, “The Fountain of Youth,”
in which Hilda Spong has at leading part.
Lincoln Plumer is in a co. which is doing
a new mirth-maker, “Keep Her Smiling.”
in Boston. N’Yark has been revelling in
Shakspeare; Laurette Taylor (“creator” of
Peg o’ the Public’s Heart, and wife of
dramatist Hartley Manners) has appeared
as Kate the Shrew. Juliet and Portia, the
last-named to the Shylock of O. P. Heggic.
Generally Speaking N’Yark was more im-
pressed by the Australian’s Shylock than
by the lady’s Portia.
“Fax”: Ellen Terry was smothered in con-
gratulations on Feb. 27, when she was said
to attain the age of 70. Seventy? I know
the “Dramatic List” says she was “born in
1848.” But, if so, she played the part of
Arthur in “King
John” when she
was eight. Also
sister Kate must
have played Ariel
in “The Tempest”
when she was 15.
and Cordelia in
“King Lear” be-
fore she was 16.
As for Ellen, the
Times of March
25, 1863, said:
“She is matured
into one of the hap-
piest specimens of
what the French
call the ing&nue
that have been seen
on any stage.” This
could hardly have
been written of an
actress who was
only a month past
15. Apparently the
ages of the famous
Terry sisters were
post-dated. Pre-
suming Ellen was
not less than 12

form personality was charmingly impressive,
and she played the grand old lady to per-

“Chudali”: The Melbourne Yid players
have just given an acceptable performance
of the “Jewish King Lear,” in the Temper-
ance Hall. Weisberg and the Finkelsteins

THE WARRIOR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“President Wilson has ruled that all citizens must
occupy themselves with useful duties, or be drafted
off' to the \< r ar. Among those who are held to be
engaged in useless occupations are picture actors.”
The picture actor raised his head,
llis eye flashed cold disdain.
“And does this Wilson know,” he said,
“Whom ’tis he would entrain
And draft off to his trashy war?
We are the men of action !
Last year alone my part I bore
In fierce pitched battles quite a score,
And gave great satisfaction.
“The Civil War I’ve fought through thrice;
I’ve died at Waterloo;
The Crimea I invaded twice—
I've won Trafalgar, too.
In Cromwell's wars with other mimes
I’ve held a proud ascendance;
I've whipped the Spaniard for his crimes,
And bravely won a dozen times
Our War of Independence!
“What wars were fought in blood and pain
From David’s to the Marne,
We actors have fought o’er again,
And do not give a darn
For death or hurt! Ton leave- us to
Our various evasions,
And this wild war you’re blundering through
We’ll guarantee to win for you
On several occasions!”
VICTOR)
STARGAZER.
THE EXPLANATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Because I’m happy I must sing upon the hstfiiimr
boat;
Despite their frowns, I sing and sing as if to eraek
my throat;
Fools iook askance and women frown, but I still do
my best,
For when I’m full of melody I chuck it off my chest.
The merry engines beat the time and lighted ships
stream past;
I wave my hands and send a hail that’s like a
whistle-blast.
What do I care for solemn fools who will not sing
with me?
“Cheer up!” I yell, and dance to show how gay a
man can be.
With papers and with spectacles and small brown
bags they sit.
And when I call for choruses each nearly has a fit;
The jolly engines beat the time, the engine bell*
they ring;
In silence I would soon 'explode, so I have got to
sing.
Why can’t they sing and dance with me instead of
sitting there?
It would be worth while going home if each one did
his share.
I call for song—for song and dance! They only
Crane their necks
When they should dance like mad and shake the
brave old frigate’s decks.
Well, if they won’t, I’ll sing for them —a roaring
rattling song ;. „
To touch their hearts, and wring their ears, ‘.and
shove the ship along!
I’ll cheer these sneering wowsers up before they- go
to bunk.
Begod, I know what’s wrong witli them! The khoh
damn lot are drunk!

150,000 Last Year!
—the enormous annual output of Overland motor cars!
Many thousands of them went to all parts of the world. The Overland
is indeed the international motor car, because it is made on a scale which
permits a value unapproached!
Appearance, performance, comfort, service, price all these essen-
tials of the ideal motor car are distinct Overland advantages.
For instance, note the “85-Four ~p shown here. A car of great power,
but so simple to operate that a child can drive it Sturdy, depend-
able, so satisfactory that it has won the enthusiasm of everyone who
ever owned one.

Simple and Effective Methods.
By Olga Amsdell, Special Correspondent,
London, Eng.
The Killing of Superfluous Hair.
It is easy to remove superfluous hair tem-
porarily, but to remove it permanently is
quite another matter. Not many women
know that for this purpose such a simple
substance as powdered pheminol may be
used, applied directly to the hair. The recom-
mended treatment is designed not merely to
instantly* remove the hair, but also to event-
ually kill the roots entirely. Almost any
chemist could supply an ounce of pheminol,
which quantity should be sufficient.
Renewing Complexions by Absorption.
If your complexion is marred with sallow-
ness, moth patches, pimples or freckles, it is
useless to potter with powders and paints,
lotions, creams and things in an effort to get
rid of the trouble. Unless you have some
ability as an artist, you will mar your ap-
pearance still more. The new and rational
way is to take off the complexion itself, with
all its offensive marks. Just get some pure
mercolized wax at the chemist’s and use at
night the same as cold cream. Remote next
morning with water and soap, following with
dash of cold water. The mercolized wax
absorbs the half-dead scarf skin in flaky
particles, so gradually that no one guesses
you are treating your face—unless it be by
the result, which is truly wonderful. There
is nothing like it for bestowing a natural,
healthy and beautiful complexion.
A “Blackhead” Secret.
Blackheads, oily skins and enlarged pores
usually go together, but can be instantly
corrected by a unique new process. A tablet
of stymol, obtained from the chemist, is
dropped in a tumbler of hot water, which will
then of course “fizz” briskly. When the
effervescence has subsided the face is bathed
with the Stymol-charged Water and then dried
with a towel. The offending blackheads, of
their own accord, come right off on the
towel, the large oily pores immediately con-
tract and efface themselves naturally. There
is no squeezing, forcing, or any drastic
action. The skin is left uninjured, smooth,
soft and cool. A few such treatments should
be taken at intervals of three or four days
thereafter in order to insure the permanence
of the pleasing result so quickly obtained.
Don’t Have Grey Hair.
Grey hair is often a serious handicap to
both men and women while still in the prime
of life. Hair dyes are not advisable because
they are always obvious, inconvenient and
often down-right injurious. Few people know
that a very simple formula, which is easily
made up at home, will turn the hair back to
a natural color in a perfectly harmless man-
ner. You have only to get two ounces of
tammalite concentrate from your chemist and
mix it with three ounces of bay rum to prove
this. Apply this simple and harmless lotion
for a few nights to the hair with a small
sponge, and the greyness will gradually dis-
appear. The lotion is neither sticky nor
greasy and has been proved over and over
again for generations past by those in pos-
session of the formula.
About Shampoos.
To quote an eminent London beauty
specialist: “The slimy egg cannot dissolve
the scalp impurities, but only adds to the
trouble by completely choking the pores with
animal matter.” The substance sticks, de-
composes, thereby causing the hair to assume
a dead, “dull color.” Avoid eggs (and soap
too) on your hair. Try the delightful pre-
paration made by stirring a teaspoonful of
stallax in a cup of hot water. It will bring
out new beauty possibilities in your hair,
will clear and prevent dandruff, and leave
that fine fluffy effect so much sought after.
It also removes excess oil or greasiness. [1

CLAUDE R. KERR, Proprietor.
Back in Melbourne from Gallipoli, via
France and England, Lieut. Rothwell Gor-
don, M.C., who helped to defend Lone Pine
and assisted in the Evacuation. One of
the Southland boys, he had another escape
when he was exhumed at Polygon M ood,
two fellow officers, whom the same shell
buried, being killed. He is an old Essendon
athlete.
“Ru-be”: What is this about P.M.G
Webster delivering letters weeks after they
were posted? Last week I got a letter
guaranteed by the official stamp thereon to
have been posted at a N.S.W. country town
on June 20, 1918. Seems to me the P.M.G.
is speeding things up a bit and ought to get
a fair deal.
Percy Russell, the Vic. miner who fought
two Federal elections —Irvine for Flinders
and Jowett for the Grampians —and has
lately been trying conclusions with the
Reaper at N a sanatorium, has managed to
keep out of the track of the scythe, and
anticipates a return to the warpath in the
Spring.
Another Adelaide lawyer killed in the war
is Angus Ferguson, of the firm of Bakewell,
Stow and Piper. He was a Westralian who
crossed to Adelaide on a scholarship in 1907,
before there was a University in his own
State. In Adelaide he took a first-class B.A.
and LL.B., and was prominent in rowing
and lacrosse.
Vic. Police-supe George Westcott, about to
retire to the chimney-corner, holds the
Royal Humane Society’s silver medal and
the valor badge given by the Police Depart-
ment. In the Ned Kelly days he was one of
those who mounted guard over the local
banks; but nothing sensational happened.
His badge and medal were won by later
exploits, performed in less limelight.
His Westralian flock has just welcomed
back Father John Fahey, chaplain-major
and D. 5.0., who was always in the forefront
with the Third Brigade in Gallipoli and
France. A quiet, easy-going Irishman of
35, he once saved a breach in the Anzac line
by leading, rifle in hand, a choice collection
of Billjims against Abdul. In France* it
was his way to go over the top with the
boys, equipped only with a walking-stick.
Among those Billjims who have managed
to get on the land in Vic., a list lately drawn
up showed that as an average it took five
months to do it. But for every man who
goes through with the hunt, probably half a
dozen drop out. However, that is not a bad
average. Only 6 p.c. of the students of
Dookie Agricultural College stick to the
land. Which 'ought to make Parliaments
begin to suspect that “the land” is loaded.
“ Jacko”: The bush printer has received
a nasty jolt from, the entry of the movies
into the bob ad. business. Lost jewellery,
cooking-stoves and cheap poultry have become
increasingly productive side-lines on the
screen in many places, with a disastrous fall-
ing off in the “casual” columns of struggling
local sheets. Most bush papers’ biggest
source of revenue is now the clearing-out
auction-sale. Which simply spells tragedy.
“Two Seas”: With so much fiery potato
spirit on the market the public should be
encouraged to drink our own good light
wines which are so highly appreciated out-
side of Australia. Nevertheless, a down-
south show committee lately carried a reso-
lution to exclude Australian wines from
the pavilion. The mover, a local store-
keeper, urged that it wasn’t fair to allow
a wine firm to compete with the seller of
imported fire-water, by giving visitors in-
vitations to sample the wines of their own
country. Only one man spoke indignantly
against the motion, and he was not an Aus-
tralian by birth. I draw the Government’s
attention to the show committee’s decision.
I suppose it gets Government assistance in
some form. Of course this will be with-
drawn. Let the committee look to the
foreigner for its subsidy.
“Jean S.”: Maximilian Harden, who is
still sniping Junkers in the Zukunft, is the
most eminent son of a large and hungry
family which tried to thrive in Berlin under
the Polish name of Wittkowsky. Harden is
only Max’s stage name, adopted when he
was a travelling actor. In his early days he
tramped all over Germany and Austria as a
member of a company producing the Euro-
pean classics; and he has never lost his love
for the stage despite the absorption of his
polemical career. His property, the
Zukunft, runs to about 44 pages of coarse
paper an issue, and is published with a
guarantee that it will never be less. When
suitable contributions are hard to get, he
writes the whole mag. himself. He has
never joined in the howl against England,
and he has always declared emphatically that
Germany willed the war. But he is most in-
teresting to Britons as the implacable
opponent of the Mittel-Europa idea—the vast
sprawling nightmare with which his coun-
trymen threaten the freedom of the globe.
Harden, who is a Jew, owns a brother who
has Germanised the family name to Wittling
and has risen to a post of splendor in a
Berlin bank.
“Dominie Sampson” : Allow me to second
“Country Ped.’s” motion (B. 9/5/TS) that
average children need not come to school at
the early age of six in order to get through
the State school programme by 14. My ex-
perience as a “professional distributor of
knowledge” covering nearly 40 years bears
him out entirely. _ The six-year-old starting
age (to say nothing of the four-and-a-half
which is strongly advocated here in Victoria)
is utterly ridiculous anywhere, and posi-
tively cruel to teacher and pupils alike in
any one-teacher school. But I go further
even than “Country Ped.,” for I also object to
the leaving age being 14. It would be to the
great advantage of every child to be kept
from school until at least eight, and at
school till 16 (Elementary school, mind you
no t Higher or Continuation or Technical).
As to the fripperies which take up so much
time, I would scrap a lot of them in order
to drill more arithmetic into the youngsteia
The time spent in teaching arithmetic is
more than 25 per cent, of the whole school-
going period, and even then it is easily the
worst-learned subject, judged by the exami-
nation results.

IMPORTANT.— LOOK TO YOUR TEETH.
There are no teeth like those furnished by Nature. For service, comfort and good
health, artificial teeth cannot be compared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to preserve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap and water are useful, but somewnar
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttlefish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.
EUDENTA TOOTH PASTE is scientifically prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect the mouth (thus preventing decayj.
EUDENTA is therefore regarded as “the perfection of dental luxuries.” 1/- tube qverj-

Suffered 12 Months

Cuticura Soap and

Above are extracts from a

How much better to prevent

“Few men can endure perfection.” —New saw.
Five years John Waffle had been wed,
And he was taking stock of life.
Extremely clean were board and bed,
He had a careful little wife.
“There’s no occasion for complaint ;
My Clare is frugal and she’s fair ;
My food’s well cooked, there’s not a taint
On wall or - carpet; never saint
More faithful was than gentle Clare.
“My little ones are always neat,
Their manners are a treat to see;
My shirts with buttons are complete,
And all my neighbors envy me.”
He took his hat and coat and cane,
And;from his home J. Waffle fled,
“I’m going to the bad again—
A man can have, I see with pain,
Too much of a good thing,” he said.

’‘Chasuble”: In a film shown recently in
Melbourne and Sydney, Archbishop Mannix
appeared, with Cardinal Logue, taking King
George and Queen Mary round Maynooth
College. That was in 1911.
You do got the truth in the law courts
sometimes. When a slightly deaf juror was
being sworn in Melbourne Criminal, Justice
Cussen repeated to him the words, “I swear
by Almighty God so to do.” Whereon the
good ihan and true declaimed, “I swear by
Almighty God I’m sorry for you!”
“D.F.”: The Speck’s Government decided
that it must have a State Board to censor
the picture films that had phs'sed the Federal
Board, and, with a true sense of the fitness
of things, appointed it on April 1. Since
then the State censors have registered 300
films, -whose owners have had to dub up
£37 10s. in fees. So far they-have not dis-
covered a film or part of a film which was
good enough for the dissolute mainland but
too -wicked for the Hobart Domain.
The outbreak of war found Harold
Mathieson Beiers a junior lieutenant of
Engineers of a few months’ standing, and he
was promptly mobilised. Ills term finished, lie
enlisted in Sydney as a private in the foot-
sloggers, but qualified for a commission be-
fore sailing. In Gallipoli came his cap-
taincy and a severe wound. He rejoined his
unit on the Peninsula and at the Evacuation
he was a major. Despite a severe bout of
illness, he qualified for lieut.-colonel, got a
Military Cross and his battalion, and in his
spare time married a French girl. He is
still only 2S.
“Copabella”: Mug-hunting must be a pop-
ular, lucrative and dead-easy'means of live-
lihood. I was on an imposition case the
other day. The imposer wasn’t imposing.
He was shabby, shifty-looking, and had a
■‘record” available at any police office. The
commodity he did his imposing with was a
crude liquid put up in beer-bottles, with
cheap type-set labels. His modus operdndi
Was a shilling ad. in the dailies. The whole
outfit w T as about as cheap and crude a fake
as could be imagined. Yet he had got from
a “partner” £150; from a “traveller” a
fidelity deposit (cash) of £5O; and from
several “selling agents” deposits against
stocks of £5 each—all without a pennyworth
of security! The victims in each case were
civil-service pensioners, decayed gentlemen,
etc., who must have found it the devil’s own
pinch to scrape up the deposits. One of
them, who was being handed back his own
£5O in weekly instalments of £1 in the
guise of a salary as “factory manager.” did
not smell a rat for several weeks. He then
informed the police, who soon had the
operator in his right place for a couple of
years. This; imposition came to light—but
how many more don’t?
“My Typist’s” tale of a holiday
Men being scarce in town, and the few available
holding themselves in such high esteem, seven of
us resolved to form a syndicate and make holiday
at The Trap, apart from the male animal and wholly
indifferent to him. There were two Anns, a Kate,
Dorothy, Jane, Letitia and Sylvia. At The Trap
there is a sunset; also a view of Dandenohg, three
hills, a creek, trees, cows, and other native flora and
fauna, all excellent, but not calculated to serve as a
nine days’ wonder. As early as the second day we
were bored. Then William appeared. William was
tall and handsome, a fair man bi’owned to a crisp,
with blue-grey eyes, and he had lost an arm at
Gallipoli. Six of us went mad. I was the seventh.
I ran raving. But William was the shyest of wood
things. Shell-shock, we thought. We had glimpses
of him, and he had glimpses of us, and looked on,
so all thought, with great-eyed interest; but we
cculd not stalk him. He was reputed so well-to-do
that an arm here or there was no great matter.
Seven of us had reason to hope. Then Ann Fletcher
found this tacked to a white gum near the barn: —
Where seven are and none are plain,
How radiant is golden Jane.—W.L.
His initials- wefe “W.L.” There were six slumps
at -lunch that day. Jane said it was like the fellow’s
impudence. That evening I found another version
stuck to the wattle-tree where our hammock hung:—
How beautiful you are, how fair!
The grace of noon is in your hair.
Forgive me, in this coward way
I tell the thing I dare not say.—W.L.
Now Jane Dyer was the only one of us whose hair
even remotely suggested the grace of noon. It was
ordinary golden slightly touched up, but you’d expect
a dippy lover to look on it as dinkum. Jane was
very indignant. She said she would speak to the
fellow' first chance she got. We envied her with all
our hearts, and backed a little out of the hunt.
Within tw'o days three more couplets and a second
quatrain were gathered off the surrounding trees.
Later Joe, the cowboy, brought in quite an elaborate
poem he had found on Mammoth Rock. All were
addressed to Jane with more or less heat and all
were signed “W.L.” We were distinctly out of it
by this, and now Jane announced that she had
cotnered the wretched fellow, and reprimanded him.
He wrns taking her over to introduce her to his
mother, she said. Six of us v»ept noiselessly in our
beds that night. Before our holiday was over Jane
announced her engagement. She did not return with
us: she was staving on with Will’s people, she said.
In the train Sylvia showed us this: —
Oh, fairer than the daffodil
That dips above the tide,
I love you, Jane, and ever will.
Sweet, be my winsome bride.—W.L.
“I saw a person fasten it to the corner post at The
Trap,” she said. “A person?” cried six voices.
“Whom?” “Why, Jane, of course.”

Dear Sirs.,—■
I have for some time
used your Rexona Soai>
and Rexona Ointment for
my baby boy, Raymond,
aged 2, and my older boy
Ernest, aged 5, and I am
dropping you a line to let
you know how good I
have found them. Their
skin is Quite soft and
clear, and shows the good
results of using .Rexona.
I always keep a tin of
Rexona Ointment in the
house, handy, in the
event of any aecident,
and I always make it a
rule to bath both my
children with Rexona
Soap, for I think it is un-
equalled for children. I
am sending you a photo,
of both children, one re-
presenting Jack Cannot
and the other Eeslie Hol-
land. They have won
prizes in fancy costumes
at E slick’s Palladium,
Manly Carnival, Bondi
Carnival, Leichhardt Car-
nival and many others.
They have been much
admired everywhere, and
I know are true Rexona
children, and I can hon-
estly say always will be.
Wishing Rexona every
success,
I am, yours truly,
(Sgd.)

SOAP BUBBLE PARTIES.
The latest fad in juvenile society is a “SOAP BUBBLE PARTY.” A bubble contest is
great riiits are given for tue biggest bubble, the brightest bubble, and the longest-lasting
bubble. Why not give a Soap Bubble Party to your little boy or girl and see what fun it is?
Save your Wrappers from Rexona Soap and post them to the Rexona Proprietary Company,
15 O'Connell Street, Sydney, and they will send you for every three Wrappers that you post
them a Rexona Bubble Pipe, which blows Bubbles in the new way. The Rexona Soap is in the
Pipe itself and only water is needed. The mouthpiece is sterilised, and so makes Soap Bubble
blowing a clean and delicate sport.
Rexona Bubble Pipes are something new, and afford great fun for young and old alike. There
is no trouble, for they are all ready to use, and one of these Rexona Soap Bubble Pipes will
blow bubbles for many days.
For every three Rexona Soap Wrappers posted us we will send one of these Rexona Bubble
Pipes, and if you are desiring enough Bubble Pipes for a party, and have not sufficient Wrappers,
send 3d. for each extra Pipe desired. Tell the children to follow the directions printed on the
package, then watch the fun. The tablet in the end of each tube is pure Rexona Soap.

Immortality.
[For The Bulletin.]
rINHERE shall be nights of weeping
' I And shining morns after.
JL Into our hearts will come creeping
Happy world laughter.
Heart of me, God’s red mouth
Has a full wind for blowing
Music out of the south
Over green things growing.
The eyes in our head
May be sore with the salt tears falling;
But surely, surely the rose is red
And the birds are calling!
With word-sheaves to bind us,
The fields of their harvest grow white;
But God never meant darkness to blind us
When He gave us the night.
Thought sits late and pale
With a hard crabbed book for the reading ;
And daylight and lampshine may fail,
But.would we be heeding?
Would we be heeding who know?
Let them mock us and leave us;
For love, scraping tunes with his bow,
.Will never deceive us.
And ’tis up and away to the places
Beyond and afar
Where the laughter on all the kind faces
Is rayed like a star.
Heart of me, was it God made laughter?
Would He let a tear come
Splashing His bright work hereafter
And drowning it dumb?
Grave mould is death to their thinking
Who never yet knew
Ilow the worms under green grass are wink-
ing
At all that they do.
But we know, heart of me, I have read it
Deep down in your eyes,
Where God Himself seven times said it
To make my heart wise.
Life is the end of life,
Not dying and sorrow ;
And a star has a star for wife
Yesterday and to-morrow.
And I have you to love me
Each day and the fine day after.
As sure as God above me
Made laughter!

DAVID McKEE WEIGHT.
The Poets’ Strike.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE trouble was precipitated by tbe
dastardly action of the editor of tbe
Banner in refusing four of Cuthbert
Scansion's poems in one hit. Cuthbert
snatched the rejected MSS. from the hands
of the boy whose mortuary duty it was to
wrap up the literary dead and stormed out
of the Banner office. The busy editor of
the Banner went on placidly writing in
his room as if he had not just offended the
president of the Amalgamated Poets’ Union.
That tremendous official stormed into the
pub next door and, meeting Rhymer, the
outdoor verse specialist (union secretary),
and Counterpane, the love specialist
(treasurer), he told them that a strike must
be called at once. The others cordially
agreed. Like good unionists they scorned
to take a ballot of the members first as set
down in the union rules. They, calculated
on a surprise attack and a quick victory, and
they guessed the lesser men would be only
too glad to support the heads of the profes-
sion. “At any rate,” they reasoned, “we
few professionals with big names are really
three-quarters of the union; the Smaller men
and amateur writers of occasional verse must
take their lead from us without prior consul-
tation.”
“The first thing to be done,” said
Scansion, "is to secure the support of
Formay and one or two prominent non-
unionists who occasionally do first-class
topical verse- for them. The tyrants of the
capitalistic press will rely on men like that
to pull them through. I will see Formay
myself. I have never met him, but he is
secretary to the Minister for Fireworks and
Free. Trips. You, Rhymer, attend to the
publicity. Give all particulars to the Even-
ing Bloodstain and the Star at once and
see the morning-paper men this afternoon
early. Counterpane, I rely on you to warn
all good unionists to down tools and see that
they keep solid. Go to the Trades Hall or
see the secretary of the Musicians’ Union
and get some strike music. Then you might
rope in one of the artists to do us a strike
banner. We must march in procession as
soon as possible—with a good band or two,
of course. Processions are worthless without
music, and the public will be sure to judge us
by our pageants, which must not be mere
shuffling route marches of unemployed trades-
men in their Sunday clothes. I know
Gilbert Fakir, property master at the
Frivolity, and I’ll get some costumes and
stage properties that will make a great
difference. I think perhaps we’d better fix
the first procession for 10 o’clock to-morrow.
We will march through the city to the
Domain and have speeches. Please write
your speeches to-night.” The Strike Com-
mittee then dispersed.
The evening papers fairly crackled with
headlines. The Star gaily made the most
out of it:—
GREAT POETS’ STRIKE.
UNION LAUREATES DOWN TOOLS.
THREATENED SHORTAGE OF SONNETS.
EMPLOYERS DEFY THE STRIKERS.
The Morning Glory next day deplored the
poets’ attitude in a solemn sub-leader
entitled “The Degradation of Letters.”
What made the Glory’s noble lament more
heartrending was the fact that it never under
any circumstances wasted guineas on poets.
At 10 o’clock that morning, the busy city
heard the throb and crash of a good band
and saw a brightly-robed procession
approaching. Behind the music fluttered a
banner showing a flowery mead with a
beautiful youth with laurels in his hair
strewed in a graceful attitude on the sward.
Three enraptured young ladies in Roman
costume were listening to him reading from
his scroll. An enthusiastic scene-painter and
a professional friend had toiled half the
previous day and all night getting the banner
finished, and as a rush job it did them great
credit.
Immediately behind the banner came a
trolly with Scansion robed as a Roman with
a gilded laurel wreath round his brows. He
was declaiming from a scroll. A small boy
dressed as a young Roman aimed manu-
script poems bound with ribbon at the crowds
along the route.
On another lorry, arranged as a garret
interior by Fakir, Rhymer sat in rags with
a flaring candle beside him. A sheet of paper
with a few scrawled lines lay before him
on a rough deal table, and he was holding
his head over them in a most affecting way.
A third lorry was fixed up more or less
as a flowery mead. Counterpane lay on his
elbow as the outdoor poet and gazed as rap-
turously as possible at some sort of brown
bird dangling in a painfully dead manner.
This tableau was plainly labelled “Shelley
and the Skylark.”
Arrived in the Domain, the hired band
ceased playing and went home in a thoroughly
sordid manner, while real fiery orations were
delivered from the three lorries. The dull
and ribald public gathered round and seemed
to think it very good fun.
Next day the dear old Morning Glory
had another spasm—a leader this time: —
A PAGEANT OF FOLLY.
At the present time when men are urgently needed
at the Front it is sad to see a number of able-
bodied men, who would be better employed helping
to drive back the Hun, engaged in a sort of public
pantomime with the object of impressing their
fellow-citizens with their worth as intellectual
leaders. Yesterday this war-worn city was insulted
by a number of the Amalgamated Pcets walking or
driving in procession behind a ridiculous banner.
Subsequently the Morning Glory published
a curt note from the president of the Amalga-
mated Poets proudly informing the Glory
and the world generally that neither he nor
his two friends were fit for active service.
He had a floating kidney, Counterpane suf-
fered from varicose veins and Rhymer was
almost blind of one eye.
The first edition of the Star lifted • the
hair of all citizens with a bright, newsy item
its Trades Hall specialist had dropped on to:
SERIOUS DEVELOPMENT OF POETS’ STRIKE.
SLAUGHTERMEN COMING OUT.
RAILWAY MEN REPORTED TO BE RESTLESS.
WATERSIDE WORKERS TO CONSIDER THEIR
POSITION.
Even the Star forbore to jest about the
Poets’ Strike now, and honest citizens raged
together in the homing trams and asked
what the blazes had slaughtermen to do with
poetry, anyhow. “Did anyone ever see a
slaughterman reading poetry?” stormed an
apoplectic member of the Employers’ Federa-
tion. “Am I to go short of meat because
the man who kills the bullock is in sympathy
with the waster who writes piffling rhymes?
It’s my opinion that the world has got enough
poetry on hand to last it a million years.
For myself I could get along all right with-
out a line of it.”
Next day’s Morning Glory was all
a-tremble. The slaughtermen were out, the
railway service threatened to stop at mid-
night, the waterside workers had declared
their intention to take a holiday, the trolly
and draymen, infuriated by the threatened
famine in sonnets, had called a stop-work
meeting, and the marine stewards and pan-
trymen were keeping close watch on all
developments. In its leading article, the old
Glory called upon the Government to step
in before the whole machinery of the State
was brought to a standstill. All references
to the Amalgamated Poets were now of a
guarded, almost complimentary, nature, and
there was no hint of scornful patronage.
The old paper was plainlv shaking at the
knees. In the news columns the anxious
citizens read “It was stated at a late hour
last night that Judge Twaddell woifid pro-
bably sit at once as a Board to cons’der the
claims of the Amalgamated Poets, providing
the men agreed to resume work.” Judge
Twaddell. for his part, assured the State he
was readv to drop whatever he was doing at
a moment’s notice and turn himself into the
Special Board. The dear o’d Glory said
that everybody had the greatest confidence
in his Honor, who. as was well known, had
written much brilliant verse when a young
man at the Bar. and was. therefore, well
fitted to adjudicate in a matter of tlrs kind.
It practically told the Poets that Twaddell
had deservedly won the reputation amongst
despairing employers of always giving mili-
tant unionists all they cared to demand.
Look how liberally he had treated the Bun
Varnishers! Let the Amalgamated Poets
confidently approach Judge Twaddell and
allow the country to get on with its work.
And that’s what the Amalgamated Poets
did after keeping the Government and the
country on the jump for ten days. The Hon.
the Premier gave Scansion and the other
strike leaders his word that Judge Twaddell
would beein to sR at 10 o’clock next morn-
ing and deal with the case with all possible
speed, if the unions would only call the
strike off. Scansion agreed in his grandest
manner, and the Trades Hall gave the
“resume work” signal just as the last of the
trains were stopping and the harbor was
beginning to fill with idle, anchored ships.
Some of the unionists who had been baulked
of their promised holiday turned a little
sour on it, the sailors and firemen who were
just leaving their ships when the settlement
was effected being particularly mutinous.
However, thev all went back, and the Morn-
ing Glory wined its rheumy old eyes with
a leader in which it said the settlement and
the conciliatory snirit shown reflected great
credit on all concerned. And it wound up
with a warning' to Judge Twaddell not to
further imperil the peace and prosperity of
the State by stringing the case out. The
Judge was only too eager to oblige, and
ins'de three davs the new award of one and
tupnenee a line had been made and the
triumphant Amalgamated Poets had every-
thing else they had asked for.
So far as is known, the slaughtermen,
troll v and dravmen. marine stewards and
pantrymen and the others don’t read any

BACKACHE DAYS and NIGHTS
Do you realise that Pains in the Back, Limbs or Joints, Weak Heart, Irritability,
Languor, Sleeplessness, Dizziness and Urinary Troubles, are symptoms of SERIOUS
KIDNEY WEAKNESS?
Kidney Disease comes on quietly and may take you unawares, for often its
symptoms are put down to other causes —a serious mistake in many cases. Early
symptoms are pain and tenderness in the back and groin, bladder irritation, stiff or
aching limbs, scarcity or excess of urine, :e 1 intent, night sweats —chilly, moist or
swollen extremities—drowsiness, blurred sight, dizziness and morbid depression.
For when diseased the kidneys fail to purify the blood, so that uric acid and other
poisonous matter is collecting in the system, causing rheumatism, stone, dropsy, gravel,
sciatica, lumbago and other complications.
Doan s Backache Kidney Pills are a tonic for the kidneys, which they heal and
strengthen, enabling these all-important organs to rid the system of poisonous deposits
that are setting up disease throughout the body. They promote a healthy flow in the
urinary channels, which relieves irritation, soothes the bladder and dissolves stone and
gravel.
Keep the kidneys well and they will keep you well, but you must get the right medicine.
A WOMAN’S CASE.
Mrs. E. L. M ood, 18 Abercrombie Street,
Redfern, Sydney, says:—“As the result of
my kidneys being out of order I suffered a
lot from backache, and at times was in such
pain that I could hardly move. If I stooped
the agony was almost unbearable, and it was
as much as I could do to stand up straight
again without assistance. Backache is a most
trying ailment, the pain never seems to leave
you day or night; at any rate, that was my
experience. After using all kinds of medi-
cines without deriving any benefit I saw
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills advertised,
and the thought occurred to me to try them.
I got a bottle at once, and by the time I
had finished it I felt ever so much better.
Thus encouraged, I continued taking the
pills, with the result that four bottles cured
me completely. I am a great believer in
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and recom-
mend them to other sufferers with every
confidence.”
for
Sydney
People.
A MAN’S CASE.
Mr. Henry Adams, 44 Edith Street, St.
Peters, Sydney, says:—“For a long time I
suffered from pains in my back. I got little
rest at night and would toss and turn for
hours. I began using Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills and they gave me relief almost
ac once, and a course of the remedy com-
pletely banished the pain. They have proved
a marvellous medicine, for it is eighteen
months since they cured me, and I have
never suffered with my back since. I am
glad to tell others what Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills have done for me.”
Nine years later Mrs. Adams confirms the
above and says:—“My husband’s cure has
proved permanent. He has had no return of
backache since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
cured him, nearly eleven years ago. He
always keeps a bottle in the house, and takes
a dose now and then; for he thinks the kid-
neys need a tonic sometimes.”

KODAK.
Where the Kellys Were
Caught.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
JIM was steering the jinker over a
desperately bad patch on the Glen-
rowan-road when we caught sight of
the swagman looming large in the hot haze
a couple of hundrted yards up the track. He
was coming towards us with a steady long
swing, for all the world as though it was a
pleasant day in early Spring instead of a
boomer in the 105-degrees class. Suddenly
he flung swag and billy clean out of sight,
and began to heave himself all over the land-
scape in a series of the most extraordinary
contortions. . .Jiin pulled up, and we stared
at the exhibition in amazement. The swaggie
threw catherine-wheels and somersaults in
such rapid profusion that we could scarcely
follow him with our eyes. After about a
minute, however, he upended himself, stamped
savagely on the ground, picked up his swag
and billy, and came on. We drove into the
shade, and in a few minutes the swaggie
reached us and shuffled over to the jinker.
It appeared that he had inadvertently
stood on the tail of a lizard of the frilled-
neck species, and the horrific reptile had
curled itself ovesr his boot and run up the
inside of his trouser-leg. The flaming thing
had given him a nasty turn, and if we could
spare a nip of pain-killer he would be
obliged. We had a bottle of that universal
cure, and the swagman helped himself gener-
ously to the contents, and said he felt better.
He chucked down the swag and sat on it. and
proceeded to post us as to the direction and
condition of the road. This part was, he
said, one of the worst bits of road in Vic-
toria, but we would shortly come to some
far worse —all granite cobbles and holes.
With the load we had on he wouldn’t be sur-
prised if we came to grief. We were sure
to break a spring or axle, or let the horse
down. No, there wasn’t any way to dodge
the bad road —we’d have it bad for miles
both sides of Glenrowan. Had we ever been
to Glenrowan before? No? Well, we were
going to a place of the greatest historical
interest. “That’s where they snavelled poor
old Ned,” he faltered. “So-long.” And he
swung out into the glimmering haze again.
We drove on, Jim in deep musing over the
Kellys and their doings. For some miles we
rattled and bounced over the infamous track
that calls itself a main road, and then we
pulled up at a small house by the wayside
to ask the distance. A boy informed us tliat
it was somewhere between twenty and thirty-
five miles, and added, proudly, that it “was
the place where the Kellys was cot.”
Jim was pleased with the youth, despite
the somewhat unsatisfactory description of
the mileage. He said it was a splendid thing
to find that even the youngsters showed in-
terest in the great doings of the long ago, and
he thought it would be a good thing to stop
at Glenrowan for a day ahd have a look
around. We might never get the chance
again.
A mile or so further on we met a young
fellow on a bike, and asked the distance.
He didn’t know how far it was—hadn’t any
idea. Thought it was about forty miles,
more or less. Did we know the Kellys was
‘cot there?
We told him we knew, and continued on
our way. Jim had given up bothering about
the Kellys now, and was worrying over how
much further we had to go. It was steaming
hot, and the horse was getting no fresher.
Twice during the next quarter of an hour we
met people and asked them the same old
question, and in both cases all the informa-
tion we received was to the effect that the
Kellys were caiwht there. I could see that
Jim was getting nasty about it. We
ploughed along the road till noon, and then
unyoked for dinner; and while we were hav-
ing it a white-whiskered old cocky drove up
from Benalla way. Jim hailed him.
“Say, boss,” he shouted, “how far’s it to
Glenrowan ?”
The cockie pulled up.
“Hey?” he queried, with his hand to his
ear.
Jim repeated the question, and the old
man’s eyes glistened.
“Why, that’s where they cot old Ned
Kelly !” he said, confidentially.
With an extremely bad word the worm
turned. “What’d they want to catch him
for?” asked Jim. “What’s he been doing?”
“Doing?” almost shouted the old fellow.
“Why, don’t y’ know about Ned Kelly f”
“Never saw him.” replied Jim. “What’d
thev catch him for?”
The cockie fanned the air with his hands,
and looked helplessly at Jim. “Why, Ned
was a bushranger, of course!”
“Oh, I see. Was he in th’ Government?”
“Oh, yes,” replied the farmer, with deep
sarcasm. “They give him a steady job.
He’s bin with ’em some time.”
“'When’s he coming out?”
“He ain’t cornin’ out.”
Jim was staggered. “Surely they -vyon’t
keep a man on th’ job for ever!” he remon-
strated. “You can’t gaol a man for ever
for stealing corsets, y’ know.”
White Whiskers swore a worse swear than
Jim’s, and the twisted old fingers gathered
up the reins and grabbed for the whin.
“Y’ a ignorant fool,” he barked, and,
slashing the horse, was gone.
“Hold on,” yelled Jim, springing into the
road after him. “You didn’t say how far it
is.”
“Go to Blazes an’ find out,” flew back at
us out of the dust. Jim swore again, and
came into the shade and sat down.
We saw two elderly ladies of large ton-
nage just after that, and they didn’t know
how far it was, either. They drove off, and
turned when they had got about a hundred
yards down the road, and came back and
fired into us the biggest Kelly shell we had
yet stopped. They both heaved Kelly
anecdotes at us for 10 minutes, and then
one contradicted the other, and they began
to argue and drove off quarrelling, leaving
us limp and exhausted.
We started off again shortly after that,
and met a hawker; and Jim asked him how
far it was to the place where they caught
the Kellys. It was a nasty one, and it cut
into the hawker deeply. He scowled, and
said he wished it was 60 miles, and left us.
It got hotter and hotter. There wasn’t
a suspicion of a breeze, and the flies were
working overtime. The swaggie’s descrip-
tion of the road confirmed itself, and the
neddy wasn’t looking quite himself. "We
poked along mile after mile, and the way
seemed endless. We came to a house about
500 yards back from the road, and decided
to call there for the required information.
The gate was locked, so we tossed up to see
who would go up to the house on foot, as we
couldn’t ge* the jinker in, and Jim lost. He
was already in a bad temper, and started
off with a roll of expletives, flicking savagely
at the flies with a bit of gum-bough as he
went. It seemed a fearfully long way to
the house, and then he found the house shut
up and no one at home.
We went on in silence, and about four
o’clock we met a Chinaman. He looked
about a hundred years old, and was driving
a fine horse harnessed to just about the
ricketiest cart I’ve ever seen, and his harness
was half rope. I asked him how far we
still had to go to get to Glenrowan.
“Glenlowan,” replied the Chow. “Glen-
lowan t’lee fi’ sickiteen mile.”
“Blazes!” ejaculated Jim helplessly.
“What’s he tryin’ to say?”
“Fo’ mile,” went on the Chinky, excitedly,
“Two-mile cleek. “Fo’ mile closs-loads, sicki-
teen mile Glenlowan.”
“Now. what’s he mean? Add him up, and
you’ll find it a hundred miles. But he hasn’t
mentioned the confounded Kelly gang, that’s
one comfort.”
A smile of understanding burst like a
sunrise over the wrinkled old countenance of
the Chinaman. “Yes, Misser Kelly,” he
squeaked. “Catchem Misser Kelly longside
Glenlowan, sappy?”
Jim turned a face towards me that I
barely recognised. “For two pins I’d screw
his old neck,” he hissed.
But the Chinaman caught a glimpse of
my mate’s transformed countenance, and left
to an Accompaniment of rattling spokes and
bumping old springs, and we stirred our
weary horse into the semblance of a trot.
For another uncomfortable hour we held
on our way, and then reined up and got out
to stretch our legs a bit. I nulled the har-
ness off, and was rubbing the horse down
with a wisp of dry grass when a big swaggie
came marching along the road from Glen-
rowan.
“I’ll get satisfaction out of this chap,”
said Jim, “or kill him. We’ll know the
distance now, if it’s ever going to be pos-
sible to learn it. G’day, mate.”
“G’day,” answered the swagman, surlily.
“Can you tell us how far it is to Glen-
rowan?”
“Yes,” replied the traveller. “You’re
pretty well there. Just over that rise, and
turn to the right. Glenrowan is”
“Th’ place where the Kellys were caught,”
broke in Jim, triumphantly. ‘‘We know”-
Although I was looking rivht at them I
didn’t see it happen, the swaggie was so
quick. Like a flash he slung his swag to
the road, and passed Jim a couple of the
best, right and left, and sent him flying? into
the bushes. Jim was up like a shot, but he
got two more that made me glad I wasn’t
the one. and down he went again. That time
he stayed down, and gaped at the swagman
foolishly, his eyes thickening and blood
trickling from his damaged nose. The sav-
age stared at him for a second, and then
picked up his swag.
“That’ll learn y’ to tell me where the
Kellys was cot,” he said viciously. “For
2<i mile the other side of Glenrowan I ’ad
it served up to me every 10 minutes, and
for a couple- of days I ain’t ’eard nothing
bui Kelly, Kelly, Kelly. That’ll learn y’.
I ’ad to stand it while I was goin’ to the
rotten town, but now that I’ve passed it
I'll give every man a crack what says Kelly
t-> me. I’m sick to death of Kelly and
where he was cot. Unnerstand, now, no
more of it.”
He turned and tramped off. And when
he had got a good way off Jim climbed to his
tcet and stared after him.
“Poor cow!” he said. “I don’t bear no
malice.”
POLSTAN.
Creation.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
LIKE Polynesian girls of long^a-go,
Bevies of maiden-thoughts excitedly
Crowd to the beaches of my mind, to
see
The sudden vision on the bay below;
A ship, and strangers loitering to and fro;
Wonderful stranger-thoughts who well
might be
Bright seraphs, tired of immortality,
And keen for life and death and mirth and
woe.
And gazing from my vast abode above,
I mark them meet and mingle, laugh and
love,
Down in that warm green island of my
mind,
Where, languored by the slow breeze of my
nod,
They live and dream and breed their
beauteous kind
my will. For I’m their god.
