The Red Page
Christmas Tales and Legends
After giving Christmas a long and dis-
passionate trial, the decision must be that
it isn’t an unqualified success.
It has been made the occasion of a great
deal of literature of a rather inferior sort,
such as annuals, pantomimes, illustrated
cards with assorted verse on them, and
special Christmas newspaper issues which
try to be no worse than the ordinary issues,
but which become a surfeit through all
coming at once. It has also given rise to
some music, such as carols, often sung at
midnight by persons who call themselves
waits, and whose noise disguises the fact
that an accomplice is getting away with
the motor-car. None of these things is
wholly desirable.
The day is a pagan festival adopted from
peoples of the North, who had resolved, by
measuring the shadow of a pole stuck in
the snow, that the shortest day fell about
December 24, so they proceeded to celebrate
the better time coming, chiefly with drink.
It is certain for many reasons that it is no
authentic date, one reason being the state-
ment in Luke to the effect that shepherds
were out that night in the vicinity of Beth-
lehem watching their sheep; and these up-
lands are too bleak in midwinter for all-
night vigils, especially in the case of people
without pants.
One date being as good as another amid
the general uncertainty, the Christian
festival was superimposed on the pagan
drunk in the hope that the pagan would
assimilate the new and improved idea, and
the change at least tended towards uni-
formity. Whether the 25th of December
was or wasn’t the cause, the pagan began
to mend, but slowly. As late as about 849
he made such a wreck of London that it
was an uninhabited ruin for, it is said,
thirty (30) Christmases, and all manner of
wild beasts had to be removed prior to re-
building. Foreign rulers and adventurers
who put on their visiting-cards such names
as Eric Bloody-Axe and Harold Blue-Tooth
might be advancing in the direction of
Christianity, but they hadn’t fully arrived.
Looking back 1100 years or so the re-
searcher is apt to be surprised at the limited
number of big historical events, especially
military events, which befell in Christian
lands on Christmas. One volume in my
possession gives a column to a mention of-
the events of that day between 795 and
1920, while January 1, when killing was in
full swing again, fills thrice the space. A
possible explanation is that the soldier
w'ouldn’t- fight in the forenoon lest he should
be late for dinner, and that he hated active
bloodshed in the afternoon because he was
torpid and stodged. In the Great War the
only events charged against the sacred holi-
day are the British raid on Cuxhaven and
the defeat of some Arabs who deserved all
they got. The Maorilanders, who mauled
Mohammed on that occasion, might have
iGt him stand till the 26th if he would have
stood, but Mohammed never had any
manners.
The outstanding authentic Christmas
event- in a long procession of years was the
crowning at Rome of Charlemagne (Charles
Augustus) as Emperor of the known world
and anything else he could lay hands on.
This was the beginning of a series of dis-
orderly events which spread over a mil-
lennium.' Some little time previously the
Pope had publicly declared his royal visitor
the first of a new line of emperors in the
West, and argument and high debate have
been held as to whether the great potentate
had foreknowledge of his destiny but lacked
(lie wisdom to bolt.even if in so doing he
.left his carpet-bag behind, or whether he was
taken by surprise and too stunned for
utterance. At all events, he received, as a
Christmas box, the right to defend the
Church and its possessions against all
enemies at his own expense, and enemies,
raging Mohammedans and others, were
numerous.
And in time a hole or pit developed in the
grand scheme which spoiled many Christ-
mases. When the Empire split the dignity
went with the German section of it, and the
protector, who didn’t protect much, became
at odds with the protected, who disliked his
way of protecting. The attitude of the Hun
potentate was that he was Holy Roman
Emperor and that Rome was all the metro-
polis he had, so he ought to live and reign
there, though the Church was welcome to
stay on as an honored boarder. The Church
naturally replied that it made Emperors,
and that it would no more accept the
domination of- its own finished product than
a carpet manufacturer would stand being
ordered about by his own Kidderminster
carpet. The dispute fizzled out about 1806.
The legend that Julius Csesar kept Christ-
mas in the Tower of London 54 b.c., is re-
garded by the best authorities as unreliable.
JAMES EDMOND.
Three Victorian Worthies
Marcus Andrew Hislop Clarke, skipping
across the steps towards his office in the
Melbourne Public Library, would often pop
his unfinished cigar into the mouth of the
green metal lion on the left. This cigar
became a signal to his friends that Marcus
was within. He coveted his freedom, and
would rather smoke outside than be
earning his salary as sub-librarian locked
up among books. He preferred to “trinquer
at the house of the light wine of the
country” before his humdrum “devoirs at
the Bibliotheque.”
A little man (suggesting an adult fairy—
and just as elusive), he could magically lose
himself whenever he wished, and then re-
appear like a sparkle of light passing be-
tween shadow and shine on a holiday morn-
ing. His friends loved him, and he deserved
their love. He was generous, he was gay;
he had seen the world, and the world was
his oyster, and the world knew it.
Such a natural human being could not
escape the luxury of enemies; and hypo-
crites in peg-top trousers would go white
under their Dundreary whiskers passing him
on his wav to Blossom’s-lane and the Cave
of Abdullam, there to drink with Richard
Birnie (Mentor to his Telemachus), G. G.
McCrae, Adam Lindsay Gordon, Garner
Walch, Henry Kendall, George Walstab and
John Joseph Shillinglaw.
I am old enough to remember John
Joseph, shippingmaster to the Port of Mel-
bourne, half-sailor, half-literary man,
wrapped in ill-fitting clothes and wearing a
remarkable straw hat covered with black
oilskin. He seemed to be everlastingly
carrying books; and once I was privileged
to have a visit from him at a time when I
rented a little place in town next door to a
tailor’s workroom.
We enjoyed a bottle of wine, in spite of
the smell of burning cloth, and he over-
praised some indifferent drawings I had
done; but my father, as always, was the
main topic of his conversation. He suffered
from gout in the hand, and shov r ed me (over
his knuckles) excrescences like marbles; the
flesh inflamed and drawn tightly across
chalky formations inside. But he made a
joke of them, calling each one after some
special vineyard; as, for instance, “This
is my ‘Great- Western’”; and so on. He
was a fine man; tall, but a little bent;
with a grand beak to his face which made
me think of eagles, and rocks, and moun-
tains towering towards the sun. He knew
every English sailor-song; and they say at
Blossom’s-lane that when John Joseph led
the chorus in the Cave of Abdullam the
actual words could be recognised so far away
as Prince’s-bridge.
He had lots of boy acquaintances; and to
every boy he approved of he gave a copy
of “Robinson Crusoe.” Five times I went
to his house at St. Kilda—“round the
corner from the Village Belle”—and sat with
my father in his room full of books, where
three model ships pointed their masts at- the
ceiling. J.J. was then scarcely able to get
out of his chair; but he had a good-hearted
housekeeper who did her chores with honors,
although not with too much grace. Shilling-
law (a Dickens enthusiast) called her “Mrs,
Mac,Stinger”; and she approached him with
a margin between herself and the seat he
occupied, because, sometimes, in an iras-
cible mood, he would stab her carpet-slippers
with the ferrule of his blackthorn until she
exclaimed her agony.
I picked up Herrick. He said to George,
“What’s the boy got?”
George: “It’s Herrick, isn’t it?”
J.J.S.: “He’s looking for ‘Julia’s Nipples’ ”
—as, indeed, I really was.
Shillinglaw could not bear being alone;
but he ivas unable to have friends always
with him. His next-door neighbor happened
to be a tram conductor who played the
cornet for a kind of grace after collecting
fares all day ; this man John Joseph sud-
denly sent for; then, when he came
(stuffed with apologies), scolded him for not
having brought his cornet; and, in the end,
prevailed upon him to bring it into the
house for his private entertainment. Shil-
linglaw dreamed he was back in the Cave
of Abdullam; and, with the shades of Birnie
and Marcus Clarke about him, he sang
“ ’Twas in Trafalgar Bay,” while the en-
raptured train-man blew his accompaniment
so loudly that the glasses rattled on the
buffet where Mrs. Mac Stinger had placed
them.
One day, just on the dusk of evening,
somebody we did not know came into my
father’s garden at Hawthorn, and delivered
a postcard addressed in John’s handwriting
to G. G. McCrae. Shillinglaw cultivated a
“fist” which was first cousin to Makepeace
Thackeray’s, clear and easy to read; so
that George could con the few lines, even
without spectacles, studying the card by a
light that fell through the dining-room
window:—
“Come at once. Going out with the ebb
tide.” — J.J.S.
George made sure of his tobacco, took
his hat and stick, and walked away to see
his friend. I went to bed; but, about
midnight, got up again when I heard him
come into the house and start washing his
hands.
“We 11....?” I said.
“That infernal old scoundrel pulled me
out for nothing,” he exclaimed. “He’s not
even thinking of dying. When I arrived
he was sitting up in bed smoking a pipe!”
Over the towel I watched my father’s
face, and I saw there the relief which his
words had made anything but apparent.
George McCrae lived well into the nine-
ties.-. ..sad and glad; sad at having seen
so many of his friends go before him, glad
because he loved life tremendously. One
evening he put his arm up, to raise the
height of his pillow, and found comfort in it
—and in death.
A month earlier I had seen him for the
last time—he knew, more than I did, that
it was to be so; he drew me close to him,
in that part of the house furthest from
everybody. I felt like a child; and, while
I slowly brought myself away, I saw him
turn towards the window and cover his
face with his hand.
HUGH McGRAE.
A Room in George-street
One day Rod Quinn climbed three flights
of The Bulletin stairs to tell me a great
joke. He had written a verse for the
Mirror, put it into his pocket, then changed
his clothes and come into town.
“I went in to Bert Toy on the Mirror,”
Rod said. “ ‘Here, Bert,’ says I, ‘will you
have a look at this little verse?’ I took
it out of my pocket—like this.” Here, Rod
took a folded bare sheet of paper from his
pocket and spread it out before me. “And
I put it down in front of Bert. . ‘Oh, a
lovely verse!’ said Bert; ‘I wish they’d all
write that sort.’ ”
When I saw Rod again, hours afterwards,
he was still chuckling; for Rod Quinn is
like that, simple-hearted and gentle; he is
that rare thing in literature, a man who
lives as he writes, writes as he lives. “Poor
old Rod,” I can hear many who know him
say. Poor! tie is one of the richest men
in Australia, measured by the grand defini-
tion of riches, that they consist in simple
happiness.
I was thinking something like that about
lim when another man climbed the stairs
:o see me. (These stairs, by the way, are
death to lady callers —thank the bon
Dieu! Such ladies as have dared them have
arrived puffing, quite incapable of letting
off very much steam.) This man looked
round my room several times, and then—
sniffed at it! “So this is where you are!”
lie said. He glanced in one corner at a
pair of discarded tan shoes topping a small
pile of books (on finance —nobody takes
them) ; at a dirty old coat hanging in an-
other corner; at two tattered sage-green
window-blinds; at the one whitewashed
wall of brick, with a sweeping arch in it
half a brick deep, like a tall fireplace; at
the more recent brown panelled partition,
and at a picture or two that I have lifted
from rooms downstairs—and his face was
a treat to look at. When he had done
slating the place with his eyes he asked me
to go out and have a drink. I told him I
was engaged for the moment trying to get
into communication with a few ghosts, and
as he went I heard him mutter, “C’est Ic
guerre!” which I interpreted as “Poor
beggar—he’s another of them that’s gone
in the head.”
I do not know whether he was right or
wrong. But what I had told him was the
truth—l was trying to get into touch with
some ghosts. His roving eyes started it
when they lingered in dismay on that old
coat. So old, so worn at the elbows, so
dirty it is that it must have hung here for
a decade, perhaps longer. It is of soft,
heavy, dark-grey tweed or worsted, and in
case any of the ghosts need it, I leave the
door open of nights. Perhaps it does not
belong to the dead at all, but to the living;
to one of those who have occupied this
room in the last, 20 years or so and are
still walking the earth, an assorted and
wide-scattered lot—an assorted lot alto-
gether, the living and the dead.
Of those that I have known personally,
none seems more really still a part of this
room than David McKee Wright. It was
here I met him, just a handful of years
ago. when I was so much a fledgling on the
Inky Way that I mounted The Bulletin
stairs with trembling nerves, and when I
was so soaked in Bulletin lore and tradi-
tions that 1 was physically shocked by the
sight of a small pool of milk halfway up
the stairs; I did not think anyone at 214
George-street ever drank milk, even as an
infant.. As David and I went down the
stairs a little later, he pointed out to me
The Bulletin’s chief proofreader as one
who knew the Bible—not the Bushman’s
Bible, but the Bible—off by heart. ID-
had lunch together, and dinner, and I did
not catch my eight o’clock boat to Manly,
and David did. not catch his eight o’clock
train to the mountains. Instead, we met
“Hamer,” who told us one of his innumer-
able good yarns. “I was in the tram on
Christmas Eve with a couple of bottles of
beer in my lap—you know, you can’t dis-
guise a couple of bottles of beer,” “Hamel"
said. “I looked up and saw Jimmy Edmond
opposite me. ‘Ha,’ said Edmond, ‘I see
you’ve been shopping, too!”’
David, I fancy, never owned the old coat
I have spoken of; it is rather too broad
in the shoulders. I do not think it likely,
either, (hat it was owned by Henry Lawson,
though he is another of the dead who,
living, haunted this room. One day, I am
told, Lawson climbed all the stairs to the
room, and, puffing loudly from the effort
of getting up that great height, asked if
Gabriel was in. That was when Bertram
Stevens conducted the Red Page here.
Arthur Adams, who handled the same
page from this same room, is an-
other -who is not wide enough in the
shoulders for this coat, and the same applies
to Norman Lindsay, who worked here years
ago. Perhaps Norman Lindsay drew the
cow that is strolling out from the wall just
above me to the left, though the animal
looks rather as if it had been done with
the calligraphic implement and material that
was used by Clancy. On this same wall
there is a name, rather blurred now, which
looks like “Niva Bec-ke”; that would be
Louis Becke’s daughter, who once worked
for a while on this floor. It is not likely,
however, that, she owned the coat, for this
is a very masculine affair, with stains on
the front of it, probably beer stains.
Ernest O’Ferrall (“Kodak”) is also of
those who have worked up here; J. H. M.
Abbott did some of his earlier writing here,
and “T. the R.” had a term in the room,
too. A. G. Stephens worked here; and
apart from these, and many others who
could be added, this old room in the last
20 years and more has held some of the
work of every good writer that Australia ha;
known in the time. At the very moment
that I write there is here on a barely five-
feet by four-feet table, some of the yet un-
published work of Rod Quinn. David
Wright, Hugh McCrae, Mary Gilmore.
Vance and Nettie Palmer. Bernard Cronin.
James Edmond. Frederick Macartnev.
“Black Bonnet.” M. Forrest, R. Crawford.
Myra Morris, and others of like calibre.
Again, it was in this room that the wonder-
fully successful weekly for which Rod wrote
that verse of his was bom.
So there is a wide ranging of literary
tradition tradition, which is the
soul of things. Odd that so much of it.
such a fresh richness of it should hover
near and about a frowsy old coat hanging
mustily in the corner of a room—at
which my good friend sniffed!

Dry feed is badly “balanced,” being short of protein, fat and
minerals and also high in fibre.
Balance the Ration and
Increase Profits
Between the green and the dry stages, all
grasses undergo the following changes in
character: —
PROTEIN A loss of approx. 50 per cent.
FAT A loss of approx. 25 per cent.
MINERALS A loss of approx. 25 per cent.
FIBRE An increase of approx. 17 p.c.
To bring the feeding value and “balance” of dry
grass up to that of good, green grass, it is necessary
to supplement with a food rich in Protein, Fat
and Minerals, and one which also
counteracts excessive fibre.
MEGGITT’S NUTS have:—
(a) Three times the Protein content of maize or oats.
(b) Three times the Fat content.
(c) A laxative action which counteracts the effects of
fibre.
(d) An appreciable content of the essential Minerals,
Phosphorus and Potash.

Dry feed, properly supplemented with Meggitt’s Nuts, has the same
“balance” and feeding value as good, green feed.
It is fact that the use of Meggitt’s Nuts will make good all the food deficiencies of
dry, harsh feed, will increase the production of lambs and the growth of wool, will
improve frame and constitution and will return 100 per cent., nett, on feeding costs.

Cream of Yeast is a genuine way to better
Health ; —the remedy chosen by famous
people who dare not let headaches, “bad
nerves” and dull complexions take their toll.
Cream of Yeast is a produd of chemical skill and
great resources; it is improbable that, for average
needs, a more beneficial medicinal tablet could be
made ; it is certain that this remedy giv es satisfaction
to the public; it is a positive fad that it is safe.
Take Cream of Yeast when tired and depressed. Take
it for aches and pains, “ nervy spells,” sour stomach,
listlessness and dull complexion. Do not suppose
plain brewers’ yeast can give the same benefits. Re-
member: this remedy is a medicinal yeast-compound,
costing more to make than plain yeast tablets, yet
costing you no more. Your money back if the very first
bottle of Cream of Yea§t doesn’t do you a <world of good!
hat Famous Medical Men Say:
In an interview in one of the greatest newspapers in the
world, Dr. Victor Pauchet, a leading French Physician,
Commander of the Legion of Honour, recipient of the
Croix de Guerre, recommends Yeast as a remedy for
intestinal stagnation. He says : —“ Yeast ... is a food
rich in Vitamin B and increases vitality. It is thus a boon
to the health of humanity
In a London interview reported in another great news-
paper, Dr. Leonard Williams, Fellow of the Royal Society
of Medicine, educated in England, Scotland, France and
Germany, and well-known author of several books on
Health, said : —“ I frequently see people who, though they
claim to be well, are nevertheless much below concert pitch.

Thieves’ Gold.
[FOR THE BULLTIN.]
ẁ
arrived at a similar conclusion. Thus each
became possessed of a fixed purpose—to be
liberated before his partner and so secure
the whole of the hidden plunder. It was
not long before each man sensed this pur-
pose in the other and, being both good-
conduct men, they ran neck and neck in
the contest for remission marks until one
day Bottomley, whilst weeding the gaol gov-
ernor’s garden, fancied that he saw the road
to freedom and fortune beckoning through
an unlatched gate. He was mistaken, how-
ever, and the little escapade cost him a
week in solitary and all his good-conduct
marks.
After that Congdon, secure on the narrow
path of prison righteousness, spent most of
his leisure contemplating his glorious golden
future. Six years and six months he served;
then, one cheerful morning, the big wooden
gates of Fremantle Gaol opened and he
stepped into freedom.
Two days later saw him back on the gold-
fields and, after making sure that the police
were not watching him, he strolled out to
the old mine. He had no expectations of
finding it working—years before a whisper
had informed him of how the bottom had
dropped out of the Goldfinch and all work
had ceased. Still it gave him a shock to
find the lease utterly derelict —the battery-
house, engines, all surface works gone and
nothing remaining but the towering mullock
dumps, the low scarp of the slimes-dam and
the big main shaft which, stripped of every
vestige of overhead gear, gaped open to the
sky.
No one was in sight; the place was as
lonely as only fan abandoned mine can be,
and lie was able to poke about as lie pleased,
planning the best means of reaching the
treasure below.
This proved to be a much more difficult
undertaking than he had expected. At first
sight he thought that the open main shaft
would offer a way down; but on examining
the ladder compartment he was savagely dis-
gusted to find that the ladders had' been
taken away; lying flat and peering down into
the blackness of the depths he could see
JONES
“What sort of a man is Jones?”
“Well, when you see two men together and one has a very bored look on his face,
the other’s sure to be Jones.”
that for probably a hundred feet they were
missing. Cursing his luck he then, fell to
studying the general lay-out of the shaft
timbers.
Most Westralian mines are timbered on
the. old Ballarat system of joggled planks
which fit into each other and present a
straight, even surface from the top of the
shaft to the bottom; but a few, the Gold-
finch for one, adopted the Yankee style of
open sets which framed the shaft in
six-feet sections. This method left all
divisions of the shaft open to each other,
the skids upon which the cages ran being
carried on square Tin. x Tin. beams which
crossed the shaft horizontally at every sec-
tion of six feet.
Peering downwards Congdon refreshed his
mind as to the intricacies of this network
of timbering, and it struck him that, with
the assistance of the skids, a very active
mail, with chilled-steel nerves, could accom-
plish the descent. However, after his long
confinement, he was far from being that
man; in fact, the dizziness of the depths
produced in him a feeling of nausea, and
shudderingly he turned away.
For a couple of days he mooned around
the lease locating every long-disused mul-
lock pass and ladderway which seemed
to offer a chance of descent to the No.
1 level, but he could find none from which
the timbering had not been stripped or the
ladders taken away. Heartily he cursed the
prospectors and dryblowers who had been
guilty of this pilfering. But cursing was of
no avail, and after a fruitless search he was
compelled to return to his contemplation of
the main shaft. He was unable to abandon
hope and turn away, for the knowledge of
the fortune waiting below held him like a
magnet.
The idea of using a rope ladder came to
him when, on lowering a hurricane-lamp
on a long length of twine, he glimpsed
the rungs of a ladder somewhere about the
hundred feet level. Evidently there was a
limit to the depredations of the mine strip-
pers, and they had not ventured below one
hundred feet. Still, a rope ladder long
enough to reach to that depth was not
easily acquired—as a purchase it was beyond
his means, and even to steal one was far
from easy. It took two days of diligent
searching before he found one, and then
it hung in. a shaft owned by a couple of
truculent-looking diggers. However, nothing
could really daunt him, and that night, long
after all lights were out, he crept up to
the diggers’ shaft, and after a quarter-hour’s
hair-bristling, sweating work the ladder
was untied, drawn to the surface, and was
his.
Shouldering it he found it a considerable
weight, and he grew very weary of his bur-
den before the trudge of a mile brought him
to the Goldfinch main shaft. Several times
he was forced to sit down and rest. Thus
the night slipped away and dawn had broken
clearly before he managed to get his ladder
hung, and with a lighted candle in his hat
was able to slip over the sill of the old
shaft and begin to feel his way cautiously
downwards. It was nerve-straining work,
hanging like a fly over the black abyss ; but,
gritting his teeth, he stayed the violent
thumping of his heart and concentrated on
his hand grips. He had taken every pre-.
caution; the ladder was securely fastened,
while far below the lighted lamp hanging
on its long cord shone like a beacon and
gave a slight sense - of security.
Down, down he went, the daylight fading
out overhead, until at length, panting a
little, he reached the bottom rung and saw
the plat o# No. 1 level open before him.
Luckily his stolen ladder had proved long
enough.
From the No. 1 level the fixed wooden
ladders ran to the bottom of the shaft some
fourteen hundred feet below. His objective
was the No. 3 level, and within a quar-
ter of an hour cautious travel brought him
there. This was the level where he and
Bottomley had worked, and, as he flashed
his light around, all the knobs and hollows
of the rock took on familiar shape.
Two hundred feet in along the cross-cut,
then south live hundred feet along the drive,
brought him to the ladder pass where the
gold lay hidden. It was weird travelling.
The darkness of the abandoned mine seemed
to press on him like an inky blanket, and,
as he moved, the poor light of his lonely
candle seemed merely to push the dark wall
forward, while behind him the blackness
swept in again like a shutter. Never before
in his life had he felt so lonely. His hair
bristled on his scalp; time after time he
turned and looked back, his heart thumping
tremendously as some atavistic sense thrilled
him with the illusion of being followed by
eerie spectres.
He cursed himself for harboring these
fanciful fears when real enough dangers
lay everywhere around. Deep holes hidden
m the darkness along the floor, great caverns
where the level below had been worked right
out, old mullock passes which dropped sheer
for hundreds of feet, tons of loose stone
hanging as it were by a hair overhead ; in
short, all the traps and pitfalls which make
the. exploration of an abandoned mine so
perilous. Death beckoned at every step;
the planks which spanned each abyss and
alone gave him footway were greasy with
damp and mud; some, too, were rotten with
age; a slip, a snap and he had crashed
downwards to unknown deeps.
But luck was with him and he reached
his objective without mishap. The ladder
pass was built square of rough gimlet logs,
and the thirtieth tier from the bottom was
the hiding-place. On the night of the
robbery he and Bottomley had wedged the
logs apart sufficiently to admit the balls of
amalgam into the recess which they scooped
out behind; but during the years that had
passed, the settling of the mullock and the
general collapse of the worked-out stope
had increased the pressure enormously, with
the result that the logs had become immov-
able. He was prepared for this, however:
he had brought a sharp tomahawk, and soon
whs chopping into the logs with all his
strength. The gimlet wood was bone dry
and iron-hard, and he dripped with sweat
from the exertion in such a close atmosphere.
The amalgam was still there —five balls,
each the size of his fist! lie was thrilled
with the weight of them as he lifted them
from their resting-place, one by one.
He had provided himself with a haver-
sack, and, slinging his load over his shoulder,
he slipped down the ladder and started back
to the shaft. The gold pressed heavily on his
shoulders. But its weight only filled him
with a sense of elation ; he was rich now—
rich for life! Cautiously he retraced his
steps, testing each plank before he stepped
upon it—he had to be careful now he was
rich!
Suddenly, as he drew close to the turn-
ing into the cross-cut which led out to the
shaft, he became aware of a familar smell,
a sweet odor that floated faintly on the
stale air of the mine—the scent of a
cigarette! A quick fear flashed through his
brain.... but it could not be ! Quickening his
steps he turned into the cross-cut. He had
left the hurricane-lamp burning at the
shaft and he could see the welcome circle
of light shining ahead.
His heart missed a beat; for there, sitting
calmly smoking, and obviously waiting for
him, was Bottomley!
“You’ve been in there a long time,” was
Bottomley’s greeting.
“Good God —you !” exclaimed Congdon.
“Yes, me! They let me out the day before
yesterday,” he continued, “and I came
straight up the line. I reckoned you’d be
here nosing after the gold, so as soon
as I could shake off the Johns I came out —
that was early this morning. I found your
ladder hanging, and I came down. Did you
get the stuff?”
Congdon nodded; he was too savagely
disappointed to speak. Then to gain time
and think he put down his load and pull-
ing out the makings began rolling a cigarette.
“Prison Board let me out,” Bottomley
explained. “Giving me a chance, they said.
You were out, so they let me out, too.
Lucky, wasn’t it!”
Congdon nodded
again. He was measur-
ing the chances. Bot-
tomley was a smaller
man, but strong. Still
not so strong as him-
self ; he had often
proved that when they
had worked together.
And there, right be-
fore them, gaping like
an open grave, was the
black oblong of the;
shaft which went down
for another thousand
feet. No one would
ever know. Bottomley
had come out to the
mine unseen by any-
body—he would never
be missed. And there
wasn’t enough gold
for two. It was bad
luck that the weight
of the gold had force !
him to leave the toma-
hawk back in the lad-
der pass. Still his
hands would do. Bot-
tomley and himself for
it —lie wouldn’t share
the gold.
He was just prepar-
ing to leap when he
found himself looking
' _ at a pointed revolver,
"xoure too quiet, Congdon,” said Bottomle\
‘ls it fifty-fifty or what?”
;;i suppose so,” growled Congdon.
Don’t suppose. Say yes. And don’t for
§’ e t that nobody knows you came down here.’
“Fifty-fifty then,” agreed Congdon. “Put
that gun away. We’re mates, ain’t we?”
Bottomley lowered the weapon. He was
half inclined to shoot Congdon, but he
could not quite bring himself to do it in cold
blood.
"Right, But we’ll divide the gold now.
It s too heavy for you to carry up the ladder
by yourself.”
Congdon emptied the balls of amalgam on
to the ground and Bottomley, revolver still
in hand, stooped and began testing the
weight of each piece.
The move .was fatal, for no sooner had
he relaxed his guard than Congdon leaped
upon him and grabbed at the revolver. Bot-
tomley pulled the trigger twice, but the
bullets went wide; then, in the mist oi
smoke which filled the plat, the pair igrap
pled in deadly embrace.
Congdon was easily the stronger man. and
with a wrist-breaking grip he twisted tin
weapon from the other; then began forcing
him backwards to the yawning pit a feu-
feet away.
Bottomley fought hard. He braced himself
against the strain, but his boots were nailed
and gave poor foothold on the iron plates,
which floored the plat. He felt himself
going and kicked savagely at Congdon’s knee
But Congdon, was on his guard, the kick
fell short and before he could brace himself
again Congdon had him almost on the brink.
Grimly, their breath coming in short gasps,
the pair struggled for final mastery. Hang-
ing half over the pit, Bottomley held to his
antagonist with a drowning man’s clutch.
Desperately Congdon strove to break the grip
which threatened to drag him to death in
company with his victim. But Bottomley
held and held. Suddenly Congdon ceased
wrestling, and. letting go for an instant,
struck Bottomley a short jab on the jaw.
Bottomley crumpled and the next moment
was falling backwards into the shaft.
Congdon heard the splash in the water.
Then replacing the gold in the haversack
he started for the surface
The gold weighed over thirty pounds and
it pulled heavily upon him as he climbed
The ladders were carried on stages built


across tlie shaft at every twenty feet and
up.n these he was often obliged to rest.
\o 2 level was- reached and after a spell
he "started for No. 1. Half-way up he began
to worry about the rope ladder, wondering
how he would manage for a rest ou that,
hundred feet, which hung straight down the
ÜbJ u'length he reached the No. 1 plat and
looked for the rope ladder. It was gone!
For a full minute he stood gaping at tlie
blank wall of the shaft, wondering how the
ladder could have disappeared. He had
never reckoned tliut tlie hard-bitten diggcis
who owned it would be able to track him as
easily as though lie were an elephant. That
done, without caring whether anyone was in
the abandoned mine they had retrieved their
property and carried it away. .
After contemplating his position Congdon
slowly started to climb tlie open sets. It
was a perilous undertaking, requiring tlie
ngility of an acrobat and tlie nerve of a
iglit-rope walker. Congdon knew lie had
neither in any marked degree, but the pros-
pect of starving to death in that ghastly
pit drove him on. Still it was easier to
climb up the open sets than clamber down.
Coming down he had felt all the time that
the black abyss was waiting, clutching,
ready at the slightest slip to whirl lnm to
the thick darkness far below. Going up lie
reached all the time towards the light. It
was a matter of mentality, for the peril
either way was about tlie same a slip meant
death. * „,
The first twenty feet Congdon managed
fairly well. The cross-beams of the sets
were just six feet apart, handy gripping
for an Overhead pull, while the two skids,
one on either side of the beams, gave a
solid hold for boot or knee which enabled
him to climb. But the bag of gold was a
handicap • it weighed on him, holding him
down when he tried to spring, and every
now and then slipping from one side of Ins
back to the other, so that he was liard-put
o keep his balance. Then again, just when
ne would be struggling to get his chest on to
the beam, the strap of the haversack would
tighten around his throat, almost shutting
off his wind and causing him to burst into a
heavy sweat as he frantically hoisted him-
self to a position of comparative safety.
Sweat was running into his boots. He
realised the fact as he stood resting on the
third set up. His clothes were clammy upon
his limbs; he felt himself weakening, and lie
still had thirteen sets to climb. Could he
do it? . .
Bracing himself, he started again. A
reach up overhead and a strong grip upon
the beam ; then the struggle to obtain knee-
and foothold which would enablevhim to get
liis chest upon the crosspiece. Once he got
his chest up he was right; the rest, of Ins
body came fairly easily. Then lie could
sit panting, gathering his strength to begin
weakening, be told himself again.
The weight of the gold—perhaps better it
be had left tlie stuff behind on the No. 1
plat! He could have got a ladder some-
where and come down again. But it was too
late to think of that now; not to save his
life could he have climbed down that twenty-
five feet. He must go up, up, towards the
daylight which he could see as a small square
patch high overhead. ... ,
Another sot —six feet, more! This time he
THE SPOTLIGHT.
was trembling when lie gained the safety of
the beam. Curse the gold—how it held a
man back; how it flung from side to side !
Tliis time’ he had nearly gone. He had
slipped, and only recovered himself by a
hand-breadth; his nails were bleeding where
he had dug them into the slippery wood,
His hair was on end; he was surprised to
find it so when he rubbed his hand across
his scalp to Wipe away some of the blinding
sweat. "
His heart was thumping like a steam-
hammer ; lie must rest a while until it eased
down again. It was a bad turn —he had
nearly fallen. He dared not look down ; the
abyss' fascinated him now, held him just
as’ a snake holds a bird; yet the blackness
of its void made his stomach sick.
But he could not rest
long, for down the shaft
a wind was blowing
which, as it touched his
sodden clothes, turned icy
cold, chilling him so that
his trembling turned to
violent shivering.
Nerving himself again,
lie reached upwards once
more. With hands locked
around the beam he
struggled to lift himself.
Boot wedged between the
parallel skids, he strove
for foothold. It could be
done. Up he climbed,
little by little, gaining a
higher foothold as he re-
leased the first, at the
same time contracting his
arms and getting his chin
ui> on the beam. Another
effort and his chest was
up ; a little more and he
was struggling to raise
the rest of his body. It
could....just. ...be done.
Suddenly the bag of
gold took charge. He
could feel it slipping
around his right shoulder.
With quick hunchings of
his muscles he tried to
fling it back. But his
position was too awkward
and his muscles too
fatigued. Around it
slipped, despite his efforts,
until with a quick run it
was past his shoulder-
knot; then it swung pen-
dant by the strap around
his neck. He was trapped !
The weight in the bag
pulled him forward so
that he stared into the
sickening abyss below.
Steadily it dragged him downwards, lie
could not right himself. Not in any way
could he release a hand so that he might
swing the bag back into proper position.
Nor could he, by all the exercise of Ins will,
straighten his neck against the dead weigh,.
For a minute he held on, making futile
efforts to secure a position. But it was
no use; he was weakening instead of grow-
ing stronger. , . . , , , , .
Now the bag was beginning to choke nun.
His heart throbbed; his lungs seemed like
to burst under the strain. He was done;
he must leave go or the gold would kill him.
A moment more—the strap slipped over ms
head; it passed his ears; then with a quids
jerk he released it entirely. ,
Down, down it fell; swallowed by the
blackness, it let its passage be known by
thunderous reverberations as it crashed from
side to side of the shaft. At last came the
sound of a faint- splash. The gold was gone ;
sunk beneath hundreds of feet of water, it
lay hidden, probably for ever, from the sight
of men.
Perched precariously upon his beam, Cong-
don listened for that final splash. That
was the end. the end of liis dreams of for-
tune. He had lost, after all. After all his
perilous labor. After murdering his mate !
Straightening up, he commenced once
more to climb. It was easier now. So
easy that now and then he was able to give
a thought to his dead mate Bottomley, lying
at the bottom of the shaft with the gold
alongside him. The irony of it!
Something like an hour later Congdon
drew himself over the top logs of the shaft
and crawling a few feet, lay stretched out
like a tired dog. He was done, completely
done: and darkness fell while still he lay.
At length he roused himself a little. He
was parched with thirst, and hungry, hut
GENTLEME-BLONDES.
“There’s Claritta Knutt—with a crowd of men round her, as usual.”
“Yes, Claritta’s one of the blondes that gentlemen be-fur.”
neither food nor water was near. He could
smoke, though. With trembling fingers lie
rolled a cigarette and lit up. That was food
and drink. Soon he would be recovered
again. . , , . .
The tobacco soothed him and he drowsed
a little, turning the whole matter over.
He had been down that shaft a whole day,
toiling and risking his life- —all for nothing.
And poor old Bottomley—he felt sorry for
him now that there was no longer any gold
to divide. They had gone through a lot
together.
Presently he became aware of the sounds
of scraping, of gasping and panting. Some-
one or something was laboriously climbing up
the shaft!
A head and shoulders appeared above the
rim. Congdon reached a hand and helped
the apparition out.
It was Bottomley again!
“I heard it falling,” Bottomley said. No
other word was spoken.
“A bit rough—me trying to kill you,” said
Congdon at last.
Bottomley stirred and shivered a little
because of liis wet clothes.
“Doesn’t matter. The water saved me.
And you left a light burning on the plat.
So I 'found the ladders and got up. Climb-
ing the open sets was the worst. Lend us
the makings—mine’s all wet.”
Congdon handed him the tobacco and
papers.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN Paddy-Paddy (the name they
gave Patrick Paddington in 1888
as they threw him into the Parra-
matta River by way of a christening cere-
mony) went to the King’s School he was
a greedy little boy of thirteen who had been
his mother’s darling. Mothers’ darlings have
always found the first months during which
they wore the grey uniform of the discip-
linary institution founded by Bishop Brough-
ton months of disillusionment, abasement
and moral uplift. They have learned, as
every other boy has learned there, that the
whole (meaning the school) is greater than
the part (meaning the mother’s darling),
and in most cases have come to love their
second mother and to respect her almost
as much as they have loved and respected
their first. That is what tlieir’ Alma Mater
Sccunda has ever striven to teach them, and
she has had few failures. Those, perhaps, have
only been in the cases of boys who have been
congenitally debarred from loving anybody
or anything but themselves.
I do not know precisely what pre-natal
influences accounted for Patrick’s excessive
devotion to the golden fruit. That an ex-
planation for the almost morbid appetite
he has had for them all his life is only to
bo sought in something of the kind seems
reasonably certain. As a little boy he was
an orange-glutton of the most unpleasant
description. In youth and manhood lie has
always been an orange addict, and it has
been said of him jestingly by an intimate
friend that, if he were crushed to death in
a press, the result would be, not a bloody
mess but a palatable drink.
In his first days at the King’s School,
Paddy-Paddy found that a shilling a week
pocket-money went nowhere near providing
him with the quantity of oranges necessary
to his well being, and, being a new boy and
an obvious mummy’s boy at that, he did not
readily acquire the knowledge that oranges
were to be had in the neighborhood of Par-
ramatta otherwise than from the Italian
gentleman who vended them at the little
wooden tuck-shop beneath the. large and
ancient mulberry-trees at the .exorbitant rate
of three a penny. This caused him much
distress. So he wrote to Iris mother, shedding
tears on the notepaper as he laboriously
indited his woe at the privations he was
called upon to suffer. He begged for oranges.
“Send a big box, mummy darling, he
said —“one that will last two weeks, and 1
will be verry much obligged.”
Without delay, upon the receipt of this
distressful appeal, Mrs. Paddington betook
herself to Governor Macquarie’s old markets
in George-street—she lived in Sydney and
instructed the affable and obliging Mr.
Reuben Herrod to forward immediately to
the King’s School, addressed to Master P.
Paddington, the largest possible box of
oranges that could go to Parramatta by
train and be carted up from the railway-
station without delay. Once a fortnight, she
told the heavily-bearded fruit merchant, a
similar consignment was to be made to the
same address.
It is regretfully to be recorded that his
piratical contemporaries at the school per-
mitted Master P. Paddington the enjoyment
of only half a dozen of the choice, fruit
which were deposited in their case in the
old wooden box-room; but out of this evil
much good resulted. The indignant Paddy-
Paddy fought to save his oranges from being
treated in a communistic fashion by Lower
School, and, although he received two black
eyes and saved nothing from the despoilers,
lie acquired some standing as one who was
not without gameness, and ceased to be a
mummy’s boy. He made friends who showed
him that the orchards of Toongabbie were
open to those who did not lack enterprise,
and initiated him into the delights of robbing
them. Ilis mother was agreeably surprised
at his intimation of the fact that he did not
want any more boxes sent up from Mr.
Herrod’s, was perfectly happy, and not at
all homesick.
The Rev. A. St. John Gray took lus
departure from the school and from Aus-
tralia, and the Rev, Edward Harris, D.D.,
reigned in his stead, and during these
dynastic changes. Paddy-Paddy developed
from babyhood into boyhood. His round
little abdomen became flat and muscular, he
played scabby (a bastard form of cricket)
assiduously, and very nearly got into the
Third XV —this at a time when there were
only three XV’s. When Clobs one day
informed him that he suspected him of being
a hard case, and thought lie might as well
give him an hour’s pack-dri" on general
principles, he realised what self-respect really
meant, and from that time onwards admired
the sergeant with an admiration that never
waned.
So we find him on a sunny Satr.-f.17 after-
noon in August, in company whn “Satan’’
Simmons, “Socks” Underwood, “Patsy’
Ireland, “Cocoa” Wiseman and “Monk”
Abbott, engaged in the adventure of raiding
the orchard of Mr. Hans Hofbaum, which
lay on the western side of Toongabbie Creek,
not very far from Nigger's Cave. This was
a feat which, successfully carried out,
entitled all who accomplished it to regard
themselves, and to be regarded by their
fellows, as people of importance and great
worth.
Hans Hofbaum was a mofose German who
deeply resented the looting of his oranges
by boys of the King’s School, and kept
two savage mongrel dogs the better to pre-
vent it. Should he happen to meet any
uniformed lads in the vicinity of his orchard,
he invariably informed them of the dire and
dreadful things that would happen to them
should they trespass within the paling fence
that surrounded his property.
“Ilimmel!” he would say, shaking his fist
at them. “You gom in mit mine orange
drees, and I vill deach you. I vill gif you
Hell!”
This day the intelligence department of
the above detailed contingent had ascertained
that the Hofbaum mansion was shut up and
the dogs on the chain. So they went over
the side of the enclosure nearest the creek,
and were industriously filling the linings
of their jackets—slit round the waist seam
for this purpose—when suddenly the dogs
appeared, and then Hans Hofbaum himself,
armed with a shotgun. One of the swiftest
retreats in history immediately took place.

Looking West.
flock following snowy flock,
Gulls to their rest are winging,
Sunset out of the lustrous west
Purple and rose is flinging.
Ships a-many, like fabled ships,
Ships of the Realm of Story,
Lie at anchor, with mast and hull
Steeped in the purple glory.
Smoke, slow rising from ship and shore,
Touched by the magic splendor
Makes a veil that the moon peers through,
Crescent and pale and tender.
Over it lit and lovely clouds,
Rent by a wind asunder,
Domed and distant the city lies
Wrapped in a robe of wonder.
While, flock following snowy flock,
Gulls to their rest are flying,
Fades the purple and rose to grey—
All in a moment dying.

Satan, Socks, Patsy, Cocoa and Monk, hastily
casting away their plunder and shedding
oranges as they ran, reached the palings,
and got over them, and down into the creek;
but Paddy-Paddy became a casualty. He
sustained the firsi of the several misfortunes
which his passion for oranges was to inflict
upon him.
He would not abandon his precious booty,
and its bulging awkwardness, sticking out
nearly a foot on either side of him, ham-
pered his movements. When he came to the
palings he negotiated them too clumsily,
failed a couple of times to scramble up to
the top of the fence, and, when he did arrive
there, somehow got stuck on it for several
long seconds. Prom a distance of about
fifty yards the target presented by him was
100 tempting for Hans Hofbaum. He swung
ne shotgun up to his shoulder, and fired.
Paddy-Paddy fell into the bracken on the
other side, wounded —though not mortally.
That evening a remarkable feat of septic
surgery was performed by the light of a
candle in the box-room, when about a dozen
and a half pellets of very small shot were
extracted from beneath the skin at the lower
end of his back by means of several school-
boy pen-knives. Painful it was for Paddy-
Paddy—very painful—but he did not sub-
sequently die of blood-poisoning, as he well
might have done, considering the surgical
implements employed in the operation. He
made a good recovery, though its process was
full of sorrow and tribulation. The only
way he could sit down was by getting the
afflicted portion of his body well across the
form, and resting on his thighs, and when
he went to bed he had to sleep face down-
ward. But, such marvellous creatures are
boys, authority remained entirely ignorant of
the fact that Paddy-Paddy, a public hero in
the school, had sustained such honorable
wounds. Authority did not learn the details
uutil years afterwards.
* * * *
Lieut. Patrick Paddington, of the Ist
Australian Horse, led his depleted and
hungry troop out of the Magali'esberg Valley,
and, very cautiously and circumspectly,
through the narrow cleft in the range that
walls it to the eastward known as Mosile-
kaatse Nek. They were part of the screen
of scouts preceding the advance guard of
Lieut.-General French’s Cavalry Division,
which was engaged in making a wide flanking
movement round behind Pretoria, at the
beginning of June, 1900, whilst Lord Roberts,
with the main British army, advanced upon
the Boer capital from the south.
Below the pass the far-flung veldt stretched
away into blue distances, rolling grass lands
sparsely dotted with clumps of thorn bush,
and here and there the white walls of a
farm-house reflecting the brilliant sunlight
of an African winter morning. Round the
farms grew tall clumps of Australian blue-
gum, shading out-buildings and cattle-kraals,
and looking strangely out of place in this
enemy country and very far from home. A
mile or so out from the ranges a road ran
roughly parallel with them to the south, and
along it, towards a point lying to the east-
ward of Pretoria, was the direction of the
march.
“Poke along the road,” was what Patrick
had been told, “and if you come across any
Boers, send back word. Try to get any
information you can. Keep well ahead of
the column. There’ll be another troop out
on each of your flanks. All you’ve got to
do’s to go ahead.”
So all the forenoon, with his sixteen tired
men and lame and weary horses, Patrick
advanced slowly through the sparse clumps
of wacht-en-beetje bushes. Roughly his
scouts covered a mile of front extended frt>m
one another so widely as just to permit each
individual to keep more or less in touch with
his right- and left-hand neighbors. He and
a corporal rode together along the dusty
road, which was nothing better than an ox-
waggon track, dipping down into and rising
out of occasional sluits, and winding round
clumps of bushes. Behind them, lifting
thinly into the clear blueness of the sky,
a sunlit cloud of reddish dust told of the
slow passage towards its objective of the
multitude of horses and men and mules of
the main body—which was really making
one of those rapid movements against the
enemy’s flank and rear which had earned for
John French the reputation of a dashing-
cavalry leader.
As the sun climbed to the middle of the
heavens, the day became very hot—a clear,
bright, burning heat that was all the more
to be felt because of the fact that they had
crawled, shivering, before dawn out of a
single blanket that was stiff with frost. The
corporal voiced a protest against this in-
consistency of the climate.
“Dammit,” he said, “this flamin’ Trarns-
varl’s th’ limit.”
Patrick looked round, a little startled by
his companion’s voice. They had ridden
wearily forward for so long in mutual silence
that the corporal’s discontented grouse
seemed like an echo from another life.
“What’s that, Jimmy? What about the
Transvaal ?”
“I said this Gawd-forsaken country was
th’ limit, an’ by cripes it is. It’s
hot enough now to make a bloke think
of a water-bag, an’ to-night it’ll be too cold
to go to sleep. A feller don’t know how
to take it. I’m well fed up with it.”
Patrick laughed. For a long time he had
been fed up also. But he understood it to
be up to him to be cheerful and bright,
however far from being so he might feel.
So he attempted a little banter with his dis-
gusted companion. He tried to play the
stale old game of “What would you like
to have now?”
“How would a long-sleever go, Jimmy?
It wouldn’t hurt much, would it?”
Jimmy spat in the dust of the road, and
shook his head. “No. I’ll tell you what I
could do with, though, Mr. Paddin’ton.”
“What’s that?”
“I could do with an orange—a big, fat
navel orange. I could do with half a dozen
of ’em. It’s this bully-beef an’ biscuit —a
feller wants some fruit. Something a bit
acid. Not too acid. Something like a good
orange. That’d do me. Do me well. I’d
sooner have it than beer.”
In startling realisation of what was troub-
ling his inner consciousness with a craving
he had not been able to define, Patrick
understood his own great want, too.. And
at the moment they topped a gentle rise.
“Good Gawd, look there!” said the cor-
poral, pointing ahead.
Patrick lifted tired eyes to look. At
the right-hand side of the road was a long
and low Dutch farm-house of ancient pat-
tern, with its stoep running the length of
the building, and on the stoep, before the
front door, stood a large, athletic-looking
Boer with a big black beard, holding a
clothes-prop in his hand from which hung
limply in the breezeless atmosphere a calico
bed sheet. A Kaffir boy was busily engaged
in fastening another pole to the corner of
the house nearest the road, and from it also
depended a similar emblem of an earnest
desire for peace. But it was to the opposite
side of the highway that the corporal had
called his troop-leader’s attention—and the
response was an intensity of attention which
entirely neglected for the moment the big
Boer and his white flag, and, indeed, every-
thing else in the world.
Across the way, facing the white house,
was a splendid grove of well-grown orange-
trees, and its dark and glossy foliage was
speckled with golden globules of ripe
fruit. It was as though the Almighty had
heard the prayer of Corporal Jimmy Collins,
taken into consideration the fact that he was
PEDIGREES.
THE MAN: “We’ve always been strong for the Church. Mother can trace her ancestors
back to the Reformation.”
THE MAID: “Oh, that’s not so far, is it? Mum says dad’s beyond that himself.”
a good and deserving soldier who had been
fed too long on tinned corned beef and ada-
mantine army biscuits in insufficient quanti-
ties, and decided to plant down there, in
that unexpected place, exactly what he most
desired. A miracle it seemed to both the
corporal and the subaltern officer; and to
the latter especially did it appear to be an
act of God of which it would be blasphemous
and impious to neglect to take advantage.
Lieutenant Patrick Paddington reverted to
the primitive Paddy-Paddy gazing wolfishly
across an orchard fence near Toongabbie
Creek> conscious of no fear of consequences,
and determined to satisfy a craving for
oranges that was entirely constitutional and
imperative.
“Come on,” he said to the corporal, head-
ing his jaded mount across the track to-
wards the fence of slack barbed-wire sur-
rounding the trees —“come on. Come along,
Jimmy, old boy.”
The astonished burgher on the stoep, pre-
paring to welcome the inevitable rooineks,
whom he knew to be imminent visitors to his
farm, with protestations of his weariness of
warfare and his desire to live at peace with
the British Empire, gaped open-mouthed at
the two dirty-looking “khakies” as they flung
themselves from their saddles, dropped their
bridle reins on the ground, and scrambled
through the barbed-wire, to disappear into
the shady depths of the citrus forest opposite.
For a full minute, bewildered and amazed,
he stared at the thin horses, standing with
drooping heads where they had been aban-
doned at the fence, while he fingered his
beard and racked his dull brain dubiously
for some explanation o? this singular per-
formance on the part of men who, by all the
rules of the game, should have demanded
that he “hands upped,” and then put him
through a merciless cross-examination as to
what arms he was possessed of, the number
of Boers in the neighborhood, and whether
he had any eggs. It was too much for him.
He turned his head, and called through the
open door of the house into its dark interior.
Anxiety and wonder were in his voice.
“ Katrina! Katrina, myn vrouw — kom!”
A fat woman of striking shapelessness
waddled out on to the stoep, to be informed
as to the strange and portentous thing
that was taking place, in rapid and guttural
emanations of the Taal. She, too, became
amazed. She held up her hands, and ex-
claimed her astonishment.
“Andries Allcmachtig! Der rooibaatje
schclms”
Whatever the stout Vrouw Breda was
about to remark to her Audries concerning
the iniquities of red-backed rascals was cut
short by the arrival, over the slight rise
from which the two robbers of her orange-
trees had recently contemplated their miracu-
lous gift from Heaven, of Lieut.-General
John French, his staff and escort. With a
startled gasp of further amazement, the good
vrouw retreated indoors, leaving Mynheer
Breda to deal with all possible ami impos-
sible eventualities. It was a position of
isolation which Andries Breda found very
little to his liking.
John French was a soldier who took not
much for granted, and that was why he had
trotted his staff far ahead of his three
brigades and their accompanying batteries
of R.H.A. He wanted to see for himself
the sort of country through which the
screen of scouts in the extreme advance was
cautiously feeling - its way—to know where
he was going. In the South African War
the maps supplied by Intelligence were vague
productions. More than one tragedy of
ambush had happened in areas that were
marked “open country.” French had had
no “regrettable incidents” in his command
—save in the cases of one or two detached
bodies of troops whose commanders were not
of his own bold yet cautious quality. Hence
his presence at Andries Breda’s farm on
this inauspicious occasion for Lieut. Pat-
rick Paddington.
The stoutly-built General reined in his
horse as he perceived the two dejected
mounts —the corporal’s had lain down —near
the fence surrounding the orange grove.
From the horses his quick eyes shifted to
the big Boer on the stoep and the goggling
Kaffir at the corner of the house. There
was something queer here —something that
wasn’t altogether as it should be. He turned
to an exceedingly well-groomed and good-
looking member of his staff —an officer who,
no matter how dirty and dishevelled cir-
cumstances had combined to reni&er the
appearance of the rest of the division,
always looked as if he had been newly
valeted that morning.
“Good God!” he said. “What’s this
mean? Haig!”
“Sir!” The good-looking officer spurred
his horse up alongside the General, and
saluted. French pointed with his riding-
whip to Mynheer Breda.
“Just go and ask that man, will you,
please, who’s horses these are, and what’s
become of their riders. There’s something
wrong here. Thank you.”
Andries became voluble under the ques-
tioning of Major Haig. All the staff
could hear his explanation of the presence
of the horses before his house.
“Ja, Mynheer —two soldiers. One, I think,
an officer. They have come just now.
Nothing to me have they said —not a word.
They have left their horses, quickly, and
gone to the oranges, without waiting to
speak. Two young kerels. I know nothing
more, mynheer , than this I tell you. I have
come home from commando yesterday. I have
had enough of the war, Ja—too much. What
I tell you, Mynheer, is true indeed.
Vrachter!"
Major Haig returned and reported.
“An officer!’’ said the General, that look
of quiet anger coming into his clear eyes
that even brigadiers had learned to drciid.
“He must be in charge of this part of the
screen. And he’s off stealing oranges!
French swore a little —he was quite well
able to swear a lot, if necessary. , Hook
here, Haig, we’ll have to see into this. S.end
a sergeant and a couple of men in there, and
have these fellows brought out. I’ll deal with
them on the spot. Don’t lose time we 11
have to be pushing on.”
Five minutes later Lieut. Patrick Padding-
ton and Corporal Collins stood before the
General, and listened to statements concern-
ing themselves that were not flattering or
pleasant to hear. It was astonishing to both
of them that one who looked so genial a
good fellow as General French could possess
such a gift of withering invective. His con-
cluding words to Patrick have never bee"
forgotten.
“Let me tell you this. You’re a disgrace
to the army, and you’re a disgrace to your
country. You Australians have done well in
this campaign—particularly well. But con-
duct like yours lets ’em down. You leave
your men to themselves in a position ot the
utmost responsibility whilst you go guzzling
oranges, as if there wasn’t a Boer within a
thousand miles. You’ll go to the rear, and
you may consider yourself under arrest. And
you may count yourself lucky that you are
an Australian, d—n you! If you’d been a
British officer I’m not sure that I wouldn t
have you charged with cowardice in the lace
pf the enemy—and you know what that d
mean. But you’ll go back to Australia.
We’ve no use for your sort here. Get out ot
my sight. I’m not going to punish the cor-
poral He was under your control. Ser-
geant,” to the n.c.o. of the escort who had
torn Patrick from his oranges, take your
two men and get into touch with the line ot
scouts. You’ll hear more this evening, sir.
Patrick did.
* * * *
Not long ago, as I was crossing the Circu-
lar Quay to catch a ferry, I saw a portly
gentleman on crutches who hovered before
one of the fruit-stalls which ornament that
part of the Sydney waterfront. His back
was to me as I came up to him, but there
seemed something familiar about Ins shoul-
ders and figure generally, and the way he
carried his head. As I drew level with him
I recognised my old friend and schoolfellow,
Patrick Paddington.
“Hullo,” I said, pulling up and shaking
hands. “Why, Paddy-Paddy, what the
devil’s the matter? When did you take to
crutches? What’ve you been doing to your-
self? Good Lord, you seem to have been m
trouble!”
“Oh, hullo, Monk,” he said. “Yes—-I have
been getting a bit knocked about. Only just
out of hospital. Seven weeks of it. Broken
leg.”
“Motor-car get you?”
“Well,” he said, “it wasn’t exactly a motor-
car though, in a way, it was. I jumped back
on the pavement to save myself from being
knocked over by a car, at the corner ot
Pitt and Hunter streets, and I slipped on a
d —d piece of orange-peel.”

THINGS THAT MIGHT HAVE
BEEN PUT DIFFERENTLY.
“They say he’s awfully well off.”
“Yes. His wife died last year.”
“But did he export it?”
“No; after he’d bought it and delivered
it to the gold runners it was their pigeon
to get it out of the country. You know,
we search all Chinese leaving, and when we
catch any of ’em with gold we confiscate it,
and they go crazy. We don’t often prose-
cute —the loss of the gold is enough.”
. “If Quong Sue Duk said he was beaten
and robbed, he was beaten and robbed.”
“But he says himself he wasn’t. I put
it to him, hadn’t he robbed himself, and
given himself an artistic punch on the nose,
and removed some of the bark from his
head to make it look right? And after a bit
he admitted it.”
* * * *
Quong Sue Duk received Billy Pagan
almost effusively for one so generally calm.
But he mentioned nothing of the robbery
or the confession. In the presence of a
third party, Tong Wah, Quong Sue Duk’s
son-in-law, a round-faced Chinese who had
been long Europeanised as to externals but
had retained all the young Chinaman’s
reverence for age and for the father of his
wife, Billy could not bring himself to say
that he knew of the police version of the
crime, or of the confession. It was only as
he rose to leave that the son-in-law ven-
tured to advise.
“Respected one,” said Tong Wah, “you
have told me that you trusted this white
gentleman. Would it not be part of your
wisdom to ask of such a wise one the road
from trouble?” ,
“I have confessed that I robbed myself,
said Quong Sue Duk.
-I could not believe you guilty of a, trick
for money even though you confess it,” said
Billy Pagan.
"Respected one,” said the son-in-law of
Quong Sue Duk. "you were robbed, yet
permitted yourself to appear as the thief;
but your wisdom can explain all things.”
“Good son-in-law that hast married the
stupid daughter of a poor and cold family,
I am not without observation. I know that,
as the donkey cannot bray except lie
lift his tail, so the wise man keeps his
repose unbroken by tying a heavy stone to
the donkey’s tail. Now I, being wise and
cautious, when the stupid policeman says
to me that I have robbed myself, land
scratched my own face so that I shall coun-
terfeit the assassin, I do not deny him.
Rather do I say to that policeman, ‘Your
marvellous intelligence has seized upon the
fact. Your words are wisdom full of clear-
ness. I robbed myself !’ ”
“It was wise,” said the son-in-law.
“Thou art the husband of a woman so
good that she deserves to be born a man
next time,” replied Quong Sue Duk in re-
cognition of Tong Wall's praise. "Now a
wise man is modest before a policeman ; but
if the judge make a mistake shall he not
have eighty strokes of the bamboo upon
his feet? Therefore, though I am wise in
agreeing that I robbed myself, the police-
man should be beaten for believing a lie.”
“These robbers were admitted to your re-
spected presence by your chief wife,
respected one?” said Tong Wall.
“True. The happiest mother of daughters
is she who has only sons. Women are
moulded out of faults. They do but cast
down their eyes to be looked at. Yet arc
they evils man must have. Women are
all foolishness, yet must man have them ; so
that he may be wretched. The bamboo has
all the tree’s virtues. But the bamboo beats
men only on the feet; women beat men
upon the heart. The prison is shut night
and day, yet it is full; the church is always
open and always empty. So with man: he
leavetli virtue and seeketh woman, and for
that he is beaten w T ith bamboos. Through
a woman I am beaten and I have been made
to pay. I am but a cormorant catching
fish for others—a virtuous man easy to be
cheated. As for that stupid policeman, he
is but a paper tiger. He esteems me lightly;
tor he does not know that the greatest
virtue of a sage is to know how to pass
for a fool.
.Comforting himself with these reflections,
Quong Sue Duk peeled melon seeds with his
long well-kept finger-nails, and ate the ker-
nels by the dozen.
“Tell me how it happened,” said Billy
1 agan.
“For the syndicate I buy gold coin. A
moon past three white men came to see me.
They say that for two thousand five hundred

their noses like hares in danger and te
me at last I have robbed myself.”*
“But Whv do tw n, .
t>ut why do they think that?”
“Because a primitive mind must have an
obvious reason for all things. If the police-
man cannot find the criminal, therefore the
criminal has no existence.”
“I see. No clue as big as a waggon; there-
fore no crime.”
“As thou sayest. If the robber is not as
plain of discovery as the Pagoda of Wam-
poa, there was then no robber. So the
so-stupid policeman tells me I have robbed
myself; repeating it until I am weary. But
even a stupid policeman is a nigh-relation
of a judge; and to argue with a judge, even
if he be a fool, is to feel the bamboo on the
footsoles. So I say ‘Quong Sue Duk, thou
hast been robbed and beaten; lose all the
money, but save thy face.’ I pay some,
and my good son-in-law, Tong Wah—the
spring rain in the desert of a poor and cold
family—lends me other money; and for that
which remaineth I give notes. So was I
robbed and beaten ; but my face is saved.’’
“Describe these thieves to me, Quong Sue
Duk.”
“I tried to tell the stupid policeman,
but he would not listen —although my wife,
speaking like a child out of turn, promised
him one-fourth of the money stolen if he
could recover it—at which I bade her be
silent. Thereafter nothing could convince
him that I had not robbed myself. Now,
one thief was a devil with red hair and blue
eyes. He had, moreover, a red wart below
his right ear. Another was a black-haired
man, with a black beard upon his chin, and
a cleft in his upper lip; and the third a
brown man of light eyes like a tiger’s, and
his devil was vanity, because while he talked
he observed himself with great pride in two
mirrors, and even looked at himself in the
bright copper of the ash-tray, smiling
always, as if the contemplation of his face
pleased him —as if it were rare pottery or
the work of an artist in lacquer.”
“They must' be found,” said Billy Pagan
emphatically.
“You are my good friend,” said Quong
Sue Duk. “It is for such as thee that the
gods make water-melons from ice. For such
a friend the gods find peaches in winter.”
* * * *
“Well,” said Detective O’Ferrall, “that’s
a pointer. Red-haired, blue eyed and a red
wart below his right ear; a black-bearded
man with a cleft in his upper lip; and a
brown-haired, light-eyed man who looked in
mirrors-—why, that’s Looking-glass Fred.”
“Who is Looking-glass Fred?”
“Thief—but never associated with violence
before. Peter-touching his line. That, and '
confidence tricks; telling the tale of his
rich uncle in Fiji. We’ve had him half a
dozen times through his trick of looking at
himself in anything that reflects his ugly
mug. But I haven’t heard of him for weeks.”
He talked through his desk ’phone:
“O’Ferrall speaking. Is there a uniformed
man there who knows Looking-glass Fred?
■ .Constable Oakes?. .. . Send him up
Now we’ll find what Looking-glass Fred is
doing.”
Somebody knocked and O’Ferrall roared
“Come in,” and the uniformed man entered.
“Constable Oakes! Seen Looking-glass
Fred to-day?”
“No. Not for weeks. The last few times
I saw him he had two mates —a
red-haired chap one was.”
“Ah, ah! The soup thickens.
Was the other a black-bearded fel-
low with something missing in the
top lip?”
“No,” replied Oakes slowly.
“No. The other was a big fat fel-
low with ginger whiskers —about a
week’s-old growth on his face. Of
course—it was Billy the Bull.”
“Billy the Bull, the fizgig—the
deCoy goat who leads the sheep into
the slaughter-house. We’ll get a
line on Willy.”
Later that day Billy Pagan saw Billy the
Bull, the largest stool-pigeon in or out of
eaptivity—a colossal man with a small head
that made his great bulk the more ridicu-
lous. His little eyes were porcelain blue
and of infinite cunning.
“Stool-pigeon?” thought Billy Pagan. “He’s
a stool-hippopotamus, and there’s no stool
strong enough to bear him when he roosts!”
“This is Billy the Bull, Mr. Pagan,” said
O’Ferrall, with utter disregard for any feel-
ings the stool-pigeon may have had. “He
says he was with Looking-glass Fred only
once. They distrusted one another it seems
—and that shows wisdom in both of them.
But he met the other man often—a red-
haired, blue-eyed man, like ' himself, but
thinner.”
“The man with the red wart under the
right car?”
“You heard that, Billy—did he have a
wart under his right ear?”
“Yus,” replied the stool-pigeon. “That’s
the bloke —Magarcy.”
“And did he meet the other, the black-
bearded man?”
“Yus! He’s the feller that talks funny.
Somethin’ wrong with his top lip.”
“You’ve got them, Mr. O’Ferrall. When
did he see them last?”
“I seen Fred more’n two weeks back, an’
I seen Magarey an’ the black-whiskered cove
that talks funny lars’ night. Ted, they call
him.”
“Ted, black beard, cleft lip,” broke in
O’Ferrall. “Ted Strumsky. He left gaol
three months ago. Where do they live,
Billy?”
“Fust go off,” said the stool-pigeon, “1
want to know what’s what. I s’pect they
done a' job, did they?”
“We think so.”
“Neither o’ them blokes ’as got a penny.
What do I get if I put yeh next ’em?”
“You’ll get our good wishes, anyhow.”
“That’ll fatten a man !”
“You must have got a lot of good wishes
in your time, then, Billy. If the money’s
recovered we can say fifty pounds.”
“Money? Was it much?”
“Not nearly as touch as you want to
know, Billy; and that’s too much. Now
get out after them. Find all there is to
know r without scaring them, and then come
back.”
“In a hower—or two-three howers,” said
Billy the Bull, and went his way.


Late that night O’Ferrall told Billy Pagan
that developments had been swift.
“Your Chinese friend was ‘framed’ all
right,” said O’Ferrall. “Looking-glass Fred
was the principal; he and Ted Strumsky and
Magarey beat and robbed the doctor. Look-
ing-glass Fred took all the notes to Sydney,
because he said it would be hard to pats
them in Melbourne. And now he’s double-
crossed his two pals. But they wouldn’t talk
until we promised them immunity and fifty
pounds each. Sydney will have Looking-
glass Fred to-night.”
“If he’s there.”
“He’ll be there. He has a suburban mind,
has Looking-glass Fred, and hates travel-
ling. That’s why we always know where to
find him.”
It was as he said. The Sydney police
got Looking-glass Fred; he had spent only
£3OO of the money, and carried with him his
bank passbook to make recovery easy. With-
in a week he had been returned from Syd-
ney, had faced the police-court hearing and
gnashed his teeth at the partners he had
double-crossed. Within a month he had been
tried and sentenced, and £2200 was restored
to Quong Sue Duk.
“That ends a bad business,” said Billy
I’agan to the doctor.
“Friend,” said Quong Sue Duk, “rather
does it begin it. The friends who trusted
me with this money now admit they were
wrong to doubt my honor and to blacken
my face in their minds. But they ask me
to pay their notes, and they speak not of
bearing their share of the wrong. M'y good
son-in-law wishes his five hundred pounds.
Your new friend the stupid policeman re-
quests more than the twenty-five per cent.,
and he should have less, for it is by his
error that the thief had time to spend three
hundred pounds. Also, these, the scoundrels
who escape when they should be beaten, they
ask for money in the hand, whereas their
reward should be a bamboo on the soles of
their evil feet, so that they may not walk
into iniquity easily before their wounds are
healed.”
“How is it to be settled?”
“Weary of the demands of egotists—the
men who gave me the money to buy the
gold, the police who made me say I robbed
myself and the criminals who desire reward
for throwing dirt upon the world—l have
asked them all to confer at my house to-
morrow ; and for my trust in you, and be-
cause you can speak with authority to the
thieves and the foolish policeman, I have
named you president of the conference.”
Billy hastened to tell O’Ferrall of the
development, and O’Ferrall regarded the con-
ference proposition as wholly unsatisfac-
tory.
“I know how it will be,” said O’Ferrall
disgustedly. “They’ll jabber and jabber until
they’ve worn out everybody but themselves,
and then your honorable friend will give
us a peanut each.”
“You’re wrong, Mr. O’Ferrall. He is not
calling a conference to side-track you or wear
you out. We don’t understand Chinese cere-
monial. This is an important matter, and
it must be done ceremonially. But justice
is what will be the end of it. The doctor
says it is a conference of everybody con-
cerned.”
“What! Police, the robbed, the robbers,
all together? How many lives will be lost?”
NOT A BIT UP-TO-DATE.
PATIENT (to doctor) : “It’s a wonder a bloke with all your money don’t go in for one
of these ’ere loud-speakers instead of them ear-phones.”
“The only weapons there will be tongues
and brains.”
$ * $ *
The conference met at Quong Sue Duk’s
house. The three crooks, very ill at ease,
looked at the cumquats, the lichees, the
preserved ginger and dried water-melon
seeds on the long conference table; at the
china in the cabinets; at the gorgeous screens
between the doctor’s sitting-room and his sur-
gery ; and at the squat and smiling Buddha
throned on the mantel over the cold fireplace.
They saw no hint of bottles; and their tem-
perature fell several degrees.
Quong Sue Duk entered, gorgeous in his
Chinese holiday clothes, and, after him, his
countrymen, also arrayed a la Chinese;
European clothes were discarded for the
solemn ceremonial of a day with money for
the subject.
Quong Sue Duk seated himself at a point
half-way down the table; his son-in-law next
him. The principal of the syndicate, a fat
and unctuously solemn Chinaman, sat imme-
diately opposite Quong Sue Duk, each of the
champions thus selecting his opponent. The
other two Chinamen of the syndicate sat
next their principal, and next
them Detective O’Ferrall. On
Billy’s left, and next above the
doctor, sat Tong Wah, the noble
son-in-law of Quong Sue Duk.
Naturally cowardly, Quong
Sue Duk’s two assaulters saw in
this overpowering strength of
China—strong muscular men of
great tonnage and dignity—a
new menace of revenge. They
drew their chairs closer to-
gether at the end of the table,
until a haughty stare from the
principal of the syndicate
warned them to keep their dis-
tance. Trembling the two crooks
looked at the man they had
beaten. He did not seem aware
of their unwholesome presence,
and looked through them as if
they were but superstitions.
“This conference is to decide
the apportionment of the money
recovered,” said Billy Pagan.
“It must be fair. Now,
Quong Sue Duk was one of the
syndicate, so he must bear his
portion of the loss. Yet is
Quong Sue Duk the most
aggrieved person.”
“We must not lose,” said the fat princi-
pal of the syndicate, Sam War Loong.
“The owners must lose, Quong Sue Duk
must lose, and his son-in-law must lose,”
replied Billy.
“But why?” demanded Tong Wah. “Shall
I be at pain for my virtue?”
“Error has but a short time to live,” said
Quong Sue Duk; “and after a hundred
miles of subtleties, sophisms and lies, the
smallest truth remains precisely what it was
before. I have been beaten and robbed.
Shall I pay money for my bruises?”
“But your wife made you promise to pay
the police a fourth part,” said Sam War
Loong, the fat principal of the syndicate.
“A man must listen to his wife —and not
believe her,” said Tong Wah.
“The minds of women are quicksilver and
their hearts are wax,” said Quong Sue Duk.
“The tongues of women increase by the
length they take from their feet; but is that
a reason why I should pay for being beaten? t
Or that my son-in-law should lose for his ’
virtue? He is a son to me—as good a son
as ever gave a father a beautiful coffin to be
ready when I salute the world, like a dying
lamp that has burned its oil. Should m>
virtuous son-in-law suffer for being kind?”
“Ah!” said Sam War Loong. “What a
pleasure it is to give! There would be
no rich men if all were capable of feeline-
this beautiful truth.” 8
“All is lost when people fear death more
than poverty,” supplemented the principal
partner, Sun Loy Ming.
“A man who gives away his house mav
eat sand ?> said Sam War Loong.
“What’s all the maggin’ about?” inter-
rupted Billy the Bull impatiently. “Wliat’s
the good of the Pongs jabberin’ there? What
they gonna do?—tha’s what I wanna
know.”
“Quiet! They argue in their own way,”
said the detective menacingly. “I tell you
now, Billy, if one of you utters a word
again, I’ll pinch the lot for vagrancy.”
The threat was enough for the thieves
and they were dumb.
“Respected one,” said Tong Wah. “I

can any wan join in?”
am but young and unworthy, yet may I
speak. Worthy are ye all; yet remember
that that which is not cannot be shared.
Much money has been lost; only the beating
remains unwasted. Should the beatings be
shared?” He smiled, conscious of the excel-
lence of the point.
“Beatings there are to share, and bruis-
ings,” pursued Tong Wah. “But of money
there must be an end. One does not
find palm-trees in Canton.
“What is money?” demanded the
doctor. “Health is all the joys of
life —so fragile and so fugitive, and
at the approach of infirmity they
vanish.”
“What is health if one starve?”
demanded Sam War Loong. “What
is wine to him whose mouth is
sewed up?”
Billy Pagan fancied it was time
to bring them to a point. “Look,
Sam War Loong,” he said —“how
much will you give up?”
“Nothing.”
“Sun Loy Ming?”
“Not a melon seed.”
“Tong Wah?”
“As little as I must.”
“Quong Sue Duk?”
“Part of my beating and all of
my bruises.”
“Mr. O’Ferrall?”
“What you say goes, Mr. Pagan.
Don’t trouble about those crooks
either —they’ll take what I say, or
what the Judge says, whichever
they like.”
“Now, respected ones,” continued
Billy, “it is with you. What shall
the conference give you?”
“He that lets things be given him
is not good at taking,” said Sam
War Loong.
“Here there is no taking. The
law awards the money to Quong
Sue Duk. He could scorn all of
you, but his justice is good. He
blames himself for his carelessness
—and a just man forgives every-
thing to him who forgives himself
nothing. And he has been beaten.
Yet you can be hard-hearted ; prov-
ing that it is the rich Who want
most things. Quong Sue Duk but
went out as a trusted man to buy
a horse, and instead he met the
tigers, and these tore his flesh and
made powder of his bones. He
went forth to buy, and luck
brought him to the market
of a thief. A wise man takes with him to
market _ good and bad coin : for the reason-
able price he pays in good money ; for the
price of the robber he pays in bad coin; and
none are swindled, because he who receives
the bad money charges four times the just
price of the goods.”
Billy was on safe ground now with these
born buyers and sellers ; they heard familar
things; and in that mind he launched the
oldest Chinese joke there is.
“A man with bad money went by night
to buy a pig of a stranger; buyer and
seller bought while running in the dark and
not knowing each other. Not till they
reached home did one know the money was
bad and the other that the pig had been
long dead.”
At the telling of which Quong, Sue Duk
slapped Tong Wall in great joy' and Sam
War Loong slapped Sun Loy Ming and then
shook like a jelly within his splendid rai-
ment and laughed long and thoroughly,
Sam War Loong cheeked his laughter and
said with dignity: “Quong Sue Duk is si
virtuous man. Let the white man award to
each man his justice.”
“Then this is my judgment. Tong Wall
gave his father five hundred pounds. He
shall receive four hundred and fifty pounds
—and the reward of virtue. Quong Sue Duk
has paid the syndicate fifteen hundred
pounds and given notes for one thousand.
He shall receive that note back and give
two hundred pounds. Thus the syndicate
receives seventeen hundred of its two thou-
sand five hundred. And as Quong Sue Duk
holds one-fifth of the syndicate, he also
loses one-fifth of the eight hundred pounds
which is the syndicate’s loss. Quong Sue
Duk has received two thousand two hundred
pounds from the police. With four hundred
and thirty pounds paid to Tong Wall and
two hundred to the syndicate, he thus has
fifteen hundred and fifty pounds left. But.
he has already paid fifteen hundred, of
which one thousand pounds was his own,
and besides is the loser of one-fifth of the
syndicate’s loss. He pays the police two
hundred and seventy-five pounds, of which
the police retain one hundred and fifty
pounds, giving the stool-pigeon fifty pounds
and the other criminals twenty-five pounds
each.”
“Wot! Wot!” Billy the Bull exclaimed.
“He should have bamboos on, his feet,”
said Quong Sue Duk, and with that forgot
the thieves for ever.
“So Quong Sue Duk; gains one hundred
and fifteen pounds for his beatings, the syn-
dicate members lose each his share of eight
hundred, and Tong Wah loses fifty pounds.
All agreed?”
“All.”
“I’m jake,” said Detective O’Ferrall.,
“They’re good fellows, and human nature
wins all the races.”
“I shall pay,” said Quong Sue Duk.
“He handed a little roll of notes to
O’Ferrall, and O’Ferrall bade them all good-
day and made his exit pursued by the
three unspeakables.
“Four hundred and fifty pounds to the
virtuous son-in-law of a poor and cold
family,” said Quong Sue Duk. “Two hun-
dred to the most noble syndicate. And now
for the rice wine. Also, I have drink for
strong men—brandy with new strength from
the soaked bones of tigers.”
So at the end they wished one another
good day in Chinese ceremonial. Which is
to say they wished each other a smooth
road, cool repose, a fair wind and a pro-
pitious current in the river, although there
was not any river concerned. They wished
each other a hundred strong sons and a
splendid funeral with all the sons weeping;
also that each son might, marry a virgin,
and that each virgin might have the thirty
virtues and perfections. And Quong Sue Duk
attributed to each of his friends the four
immovable principles of Buddha—which, are
Mercy, Hatred of Cruelty, Boundless Com-
passion and Obedience to the Law.
The only irreconcilable was Looking-glass
Fred, the thief who double-crossed his mates,
and who, committed to long travail in a
cold and durable prison, hated the last prin-
ciple of Buddha, as he practised the other
three, with exclusively personal applica-
tion—Mercy (for himself), hatred of
cruelty (to himself) and boundless compas-
sion (for his own ills).
But Quong Sue Duk, his face well saved,
thanked his fat-bellied smiling Buddha, and
burned many punk sticks to Gratitude.

GREETINGS.
The Churches having again complained that they cannot get the people’s ear on Sundays, the artist, in a Christmas spirit, offers a suggestion.


Drem Road.
WHERE the wavering swords of
sunlight slant with misty golden
Meam
On the brown and idling waters of
the little forest stream,
Where the mossy ground is patterned
with fantastic shadows black,
The narrow road of dreams begins, a
dim, elusive track.
Underneath the willows, trailing soft
and green,
Through the crackling bracken, bright
with autumn sheen,
Come the kings of legend, ride the
knights of fame,
While an unseen herald calls them
each by name.
Down the hill of' trembling aspens,
through the rustle of the corn,.
Slowly winds the dazzling pageant in
the glamor of the morn,
Steeds caparisoned in silver, floating
banners strangely wrought,
Lighted with the flash of lances in the
dancing- sunbeams caught:
Guinevere and Eleanor, Rosamond the
Fair,
Joan of Arc in armor, midnight-black
her hair,
Lancelot and Galahad riding in the
sun,
Where by slopes of may-in-bloom
lightfoot breezes run.
They have crossed the foaming shallows
of the river running swift;
They have reached the glassy reaches
where the rosy lilies drift;
Barns have changed to moated castles,
wayside trees are ivied towers,
And I am a prisoned princess lan-
guishing through weary hours ;
Here a knight in cloth of gold lifts
a dinted shield,
Hasting to the tournament through the
thymey field.
n.s.w.
By the winding willowed road where
the water gleams,
I n the golden afternoon on the road
of dreams!
Southward runs the narrow dream-
road, twisting to the ocean rim,
Trailing like a cord of silver through
the haze of twilights dim.;
Out upon the gusty ocean swing the
brown-sailed pirate ships,
Buccaneers in gold and purple, fearful
oaths upon their, lips;
And I a captured maiden, tethered by
my hair, .
Shining like a gold rope in the strange
sea-glare;
Bluebeard and Redbeard on the rolling
seas,
Draining wines of Panama to the
scented lees!
Night upon the dream road fallen,
slender moon and starry skies,
Little winds among the grasses soft
and delicate as sighs,
And I a changeling, faery-nurtured
pent in gown and slippers blue,
Gazing down the sloping meadows,
deepiy drenched in gleaming dew;
From the wood a whisper, through the
brake they come,
Marching to the tapping of the demon
drum,
Goblins and frisking gnomes—O to be
out there,
Marching with the pixies through the
crispy air!
Queens and knights and heralds.
courtiers and kings,
Pirates and princesses, elves with
scarlet wings —
So the pageant passes, lit with magic’s
beams,
In an endless journeying on the road
of dreams.
LILLA GORMHUILLE McKAY.
The Marriage-moon.
THE soft swish-swish of a paddle broke
the breathless stillness of high noon on
the quiet reaches of the river as a
small dug-out nosed its way against the slug-
gish current.
Its occupant was peering cautiously into
the tangled thickets crowning the low banks;
his gleaming, crafty eyes marking the trod-
den, churned-up mud of the bush-pigs' wallow
and the smeared clawings of an alligator’s
slither on the oozy bank; his keen ears alert
for the crack of a twig or the sound of a
human voice. But all the jungle was still;
not even the coo of a pigeon or the harsh
THE HIGHER MATHEMATICS.
“Mummy, a man’s wife is his better half, isn’t she?”
“Yes, darling.”
“Well, if a man marries twice, that’s the end of him, isn’t it?”
wauk-wauk of a lokohu broke the brooding
silence of that throbbing, heat-stricken noon-
tide.
Below a long sandspit, where the river
turned on itself like a snake in its coils, the
paddler grounded the canoe and leapt out.
With stealthy movements he pushed his
little craft under a matted web of nipa until
its rudely-hewn sides blended with exposed
roots, interlaced and scabby with moss and
veiled in a drape of river drift.
With skilful tread, his bare feet scarcely
disturbing the rank verdure, he reached a
sheltering nook between the great buttressed
flanges of a giant ruli- tree and, heaving a
smothered sigh of relief, flung himself down
011 a drift of fallen russet leaves, scooping
«? e dr °P s of sweat from hls face Wlth
ni.s un^ers.
Kaipu of Kupiri had need of caution; lie
waa trespassing on Marua fishing-grounds,
an d that deep pool behind the sandspit was
a favored haunt of grey mullet and silver
bream.
But, though the village lay just beyond the
river’s curve, he knew the women would be
busy preparing sago and the men away liunt-
ing for the coming feast of the marriage-
moon. Feeling secure from interference, he
baited his hook and set his line, tying it
to his great-toe; then, leaning back against
the scaly trunk, dozed, awaiting the warning
tug.
On a branch beyond him a kingfisher
cocked inquisitive head and with beady black
eyes watched this rival fisherman, but, seeing
no further movement, suddenly dived —a
gleaming streak of iridescent blue and orange
—into the shimmering shallows, returning
with a tiny fish to gulp at his leisure. A
butterfly flew from the dark shadows of the
forest depths into the blistering radiance of
the blazing sun and, pursued by its mate,
flirted jewelled wings of jade and gold. Over-
head, on the vine festooning the spreading
branches, a globular pod softly exploded and
winged seeds cascaded, glissading like creamy-
white moths, skimming in short flights to
the rippling bosom of the river as the vagrant
breeze lightly stirred them. But Kaipu slum-
bered peacefully on, lulled by the soft lisp
of the water as it caressed the bank. Dragon-
flies flitted gauzily round his head, and tiny
emerald lizards chased flies on the sleeper’s
sweating skin. The tug of the line never
came, for a crab with stealthy nibbles had
made a meal of the bait, so the drowsy hours
of torrid heat passed by unheeded.
Suddenly sounds of laughter and the gay
SO MANY DIFFERENT CLUTCHES.
“Marriage is like driving a car. You’re liable to have a bad smash at first through
sheer inexperience.”
“Yes, they really ought to issue learners’ licenses.”
lilt of voices floated through the jungle, and,
as the startled kingfisher sped like an arrow
across the river, laughing girls chased one
another down the bank. Racing across the
shallow bar in a rainbow of glistening drops,
they dived into the clear water, splashing and
spattering one another as with shouts of glee
they bobbed and dipped and tumbled about.
It was as if the quiet river had been invaded
by a bevy of forest naiads, for grass petti-
coats had been flung aside and smooth brown
bodies shone like dull bronze as the water
dripped from curving virgin breasts and
shapely moulded hips.
Kaipu, awakened by that first laughing
chorus, shrank back close behind the shelter
of the tree flange and quietly drew in his line.
It would go ill with him were he discovered,
for these were the brides of the coming feast,
relieved of work for one glorious spell of idle-
ness before surrendering themselves to a life-
time of toil.
Crouching on his bed of leaves he peered
out, smouldering fires of lust burning hotly
in his eyes as he watched the bathing nymphs
leave the water to sun themselves on the sand-
spit, scattering diamond drops as they tossed
black frizzy tresses to dry. He licked his full,
thick lips as he greedily eyed those delicate
contours of ripening maturity outlined against
the silver sands.
With a cautious craning of his neck he
■could discern the two old women guardians,
squatting like brown mud-turtles on the bank
above. Heaped beside them lay bridal petti-
coats, splashes of vivid color, cardinal-red and
royal purple and waspish stripes of yellow
and black; whilst netted ldapas filled with
shell ornaments hung on the bushes ready to
deck those youthful bodies.
The old women’s jaws moved slowly, grind-
ing and chewing, a slaver of blood-red betel
juice dripping from the corners of overfull
mouths; but their sharp eyes never relaxed
watchful vigilance as the maidens, their first
exuberant burst of joy subsiding, came and
sat beside them to complete the bridal toil-
ettes ; combing, frizzing, teasing out their
tousled, damp locks, and anointing their sleek
brown skins with oil and ruby-red saliva
until they shone with a red-gold gleam.
Kaipu, at his first quick glance, recognised
in one of those grim custodians his aunt
Henau who had married a Marua man, and
he 'could hear her shrill voice directing and
admonishing the brides-to-be.
Her companion, busy with paint-stick and
pigment, began tracing totemic emblems on
the girls’ brows and cheeks, whilst Henau
took from her bark bag an unfinished chap-
let of cockatoo’s crest feathers and began
to weave.
“For whom art thou weaving the lcarai’s
crown, Henau?” cried a girlish treble.
“There is no bride of Marua to wear it!”
The old woman gave a wheezy chuckle and
wove in another curling sulphur-hued feather,
the curious girls crowding round, plying her
with questions.
Playfully flicking their bare shapely calves
with a thread of fibre, she pointed a gnarled
finger at a slender girl who, already .in
bridal array, sat silently on the bank, staring
gloomily across the stream, aloof from the
merry troupe, and croaked, “Does not Evea
wed a man who wears the token?”
There was a sudden hush; then a scorn-
ful laugh broke the silence and a sneering
voice exclaimed, “Evea and old Gimori! In-
deed. Henau, we forgot he was once a warrior
and has killed his man.” A smothered laugh
followed as another added, “And eaten him,
too! Pah! Kan:pi!” [cannibal] and the
speaker spat with disgust.
The old woman scrambled to her feet,
anger in her blazing eyes, her lips drawn
back in a snarl. “Kaicpi indeed ! Since when
do the girls of Marua insult the brave light-
ing men of their tribe? Kaicpi!” she
shrieked. “Yea! Gimori killed and ate his
man as my own man did before he dared to
sue for my favor. But not one among ye,
save Evea, weds a man. Evea shall wear the
crown and put ye all to shame, ye who mate
with unblooded boys whilst she weds a war-
rior.”
Evea, startled from her reverie by the
shrill voices, stepped beside the angry old
woman, and, snatching the yellow crown from
her hand, faced her companions.
“Jealous!” she cried. “Jealous that i
marry the richest man in Marua! Though
your tongues leap like snakes to spit scorn, I
care not. Has lie not weighed .me down
with mairis and toias?” Holding up a
lengthy spiky necklet of dogs’ teeth, “Who
owns so long a chain as this? So line an
armshell? So broad a mairif” Flaunting
her heavy ornaments before them, she tossed
her head, its glossy, frizzy mop glinting
ebon-black in the rays of the sun, and her
dark, flashing eyes gave back scorn for scorn.
Then, snatching up her kiapa, she turned
and fled into the jungle, Henau, hurling a
bitter reproof at the girls, hobbling after
her.
Profiting by the confusion, Kaipu slid
round the sheltering trunk and, slipping into
the thickets behind, noiselessly followed his
aunt.
In a mossy green glade he caught sight
of her, bending over Evea, who lay prone on
a litter of palm fronds, sobbing with pas-
sionate anguish, whilst the old woman
soothed her with crooning words.
Standing silently by, his dark form melt-
ing in the shadow of the sngo palms, he lis-
tened to Evea’s sobbing voice. “I cannot
bear it. Gimori is so old and ugly. He
wants no wife, only another woman to beat
sago that he may sell it for tobacco. The
girls gibe at me, and now thou with thy
Tcarai’s crest!”
She sat up, shaking off the woman’s sooth-
ing hand and flung the feathered crown vio-
lently from her. “What pride to wear that
token when I must chew the sago for his
toothless gums! A warrior? A snivelling
dotard, whom I shall share with three
others. Never to bear a babe under my
heart! Never a bud to suckle at my breast
to flower to manhood! But I will not!
Better fling myself into the river and end
it all. Ai-ee, ai-ee,” and the despairing,
keening notes of the death-wail broke from
her lips.
“Hush, my pretty pigeon, hush ! ’Tis un-
lucky to rouse the spirits of the dead on
thy wedding day. Gimori will treat thee
well if thou wilt humor him. He is old, it is
true, but a younger man would surely beat
thee. Look at the toias, the mairis, thy
necklets; no other bride of Marua can match
that wealth.”
But Evea refused to be comforted and
Kaipu, tired of hearing her plaint, stepped
boldly out from the shadows. Evea sprang
to her feet when she heard Henan’s startled
scream and stared at him with tear-dimmed,
frightened eyes.
The old woman quickly recovered from her
fright. “Kaipu! Shameless one, what dost
thou here? Turn away thine eyes from
another man’s bride,” she said angrily, and
taking Evea’s hand would have hurried the
girl away. But Kaipu interposed.
“Evea,” he said, “come to Kupiri with
me. I will give tliec a son to bear at thy
breast.' Let Gimori wed a widow to chew
his sago,” and as Henau set up a shrill
cry of expostulation, he silenced her with a
rough hand. “Come, Evea! My canoe lies
on the river. By night we can be safe
in Kupiri and I will marry thee there.”
“Safe, fool?” interjected Henau. “With
the men of Marua at thy heels? Dost thou
think that Gimori will lot his bride and his
gear slip so easily? The sergeant himself
comes to the feast to-night. Gimori would


tell him and have thee gaoled. A fine wed-
ding night for Evea, with a husband sleeping
in fetters.”
Evea looked irresolutely from one to the
other.
The sun was setting and the perpetual twi-
light of the swamp was deepening into
darker gloom. A damp, chill breath from
the sodden earth pervaded the little clearing
as the evening mists gathered and a million
churring, vibrant insect-voices filled the dank
air in humming, buzzing chorus.
Henau tightened the grip of her sinewy,
skinny hand. “Come,' she urged, “the kibi
calls,” as high above the strident hum came
the blare of a conch-sliell and the rumbling
roll of drums.
The marriage-moon was rising; the fes-
tivities had begun.
Evea wrenched her arm free. “Stay!”
she said. “If I come with thee, Kaipu, what
hast thou to offer me?”
“A warm embrace and a child for thy
bosom, instead of an old toad’s foulness,” he
answered.
“I can get that from any man of Mama,”
she replied with a scornful shake of her
head; then, impatient at the old woman’s
tugging and muttering, “Wait, Henau!” she
said. “Thy sister’s son is a landless man.,
son of a third wife, with neither house nor
gear. What has lie to offer for a wife?”
“Naught!” snorted Henau. “Madman !
His head and his hands are as full as a
broken kupa —full of wind, naught else.
Let us hasten; they will come and search
for us.”
But Evea still lingered, prodding at the
damp moss and turning over the
rotting leaves with her toes, search-
ing the man’s eager face in the
dim light, a hopeful look in her
dark, luminous eyes. She was
snatching at a straw to save her-
self from that hateful marriage
with Gimori, but she must marry a
man. Was Kaipu a man?
She stopped and picked up the
bruised and broken chaplet of
feathers, laughing softly. “Listen.
Kaipu ! There is not one maiden
who can wear this at the feast
to-night, save Evea, the bride of
Gimori. There has been no killing
for many a year, so no village youth
wears the hornbill’s beak, nor can
his bride wear the lcarai's crow r n.
Only the policeman these days can
wear the mark of the killer, the
Government mark —the red stripe."'
“I’ll be no policeman,” Kaipu
interrupted sulkily, and his aunt
laughed maliciously. But Evea con-
tinued to stroke and smoothe the
crumpled feathers lying on her soft
palm.
“I’ll be thy bride,” she continued
slowly, “if thou canst earn the right
to crown me with this,” and she
dangled the yellow feathers before
his eyes.
Ilonau gasped in horrified amaze-
ment, and Kaipu stared, open-
mouthed. taken aback by this dar-
ing challenge.
“What?” jerred Evea. “Art thou
afraid? Then I’ll be no bride of
thine. Better chew sago for old
Gimori than be a coward’s wife.”
“If I kill the Government will
hang me,” Kaipu pleaded hoarsely.
“Men do not kill and live these
days. A hanging man enjoys no
bride.”
Evea smiled, a cold little smile
of disdain, the pupils of her eyes
dwindling to flickering pin-points.
“Unblooded boy!” she taunted.
“It is not the Government thou art
afraid of. Bah! Only the old men
have courage now. Get back to
Kupiri, lest old Gimori come and
beat thee with a stick for daring
to look upon his bride”; and, turn-
ing with a mocking laugh, she
swished provocatively away along
the narrow track to the village.
Ilenau cackled at Kaipu’s savage,
sullen looks, then, “Listen, son of
my sister,” she whispered. “Gi-
mori is old and feeble and my arm
is still strong. Lend me thy knife
and I will bring his head to thee
to-night. The price, one armshell.”
And with a ghoulish grin she
plucked the knife from his bark
girdle and hurried after Evea.
The sky above the village was
smokily aglow with the light of great fires and
a hurly-burly of noise met the two women as
they emerged from the bush. Drums were
pounding; men, women and children were
laughing, dancing and shouting. The men on
the dubu platform raised a chorus of low-
voiced chanting as the brides assembled on
the dancing green, marshalled by two aged
crones, boating snakeskin-headed kapas.
With heads tossing, shell ornaments jing-
ling and rhythmic swishing of skirts, the
little procession moved off and the gaily be-
decked. village belles began their last parade
of maidenhood, pacing slowly down a lane
of admiring friends and relations.
As she slipped into her place, Evea was
greeted with loud murmurs of approval.
Her many-layered petticoats undulated with
sensuous sway, whilst her slender fingers
flirted with the nacre pendant hanging like
a silver moon between her ruddy-golden
breasts. Anon, she raised her slim rounded
arms with careless grace, showing her
heavy shell armlets; fingered the lobes of
her ears where dogs’ teeth bristled white,
amongst the scarlet rings of sapi-sapi; dis-
played to full advantage the gorgeous array
of wealth that had bought her slim body
and its youthful chai*ms.
Curious eyes watched for the yellow gleam
of feathers in her wealth of dark hair, but
the crown was tucked in the waist-band of
her petticoats, hidden beneath her totem-
chain of sharks’ teeth.
Gimori sat on the platform of his hut,
and, as the procession passed, his keen old
eyes, still quick with life, glinted satis-
faction as he saw his ornaments on Evea.
Never had they decked a lovelier bride, and
he gloated, toothless mouth grinning wide,
drooling with anticipation; clawlike hands
itching to feel that satin-smooth skin and
press it close to lxis wrinkled, withered
body, to cling vampire-like, absorbing the
essence of life from that close contact.
His chief wife, squatting on her haunches
at his side, eyed Evea with a venomous
stare of hatred, envying her youth; her
enslavement of Gimori; her little hour of
triumph.
As Evea caught the baleful gleam in
those jealous eyes, she knew she would have
short shrift once her bridal days were over
and she came under the woman’s spiteful
domination. She shivered and eagerly
scanned the crowd for Kaipu. Would he
master his fears and pay her price? Her
feet moved mechanically in that dreary
parade as her eyes roved the crowd, search-
ing hopefully.
The drums were rolling, pulsing, throb-
bing in savage frenzy; castanets clicked
and snapped and the pounding feet of the
dancing men in the dubu thudded in unison
with her heart-beats. The long-drawn scream
of the tiparu whined and wailed , unceas-
ingly, and the babel of tongues round the
cooking-fires was deafening; but still that
weary parade went on—a dreary, monoto-
nous round.
With straining ears Evea listened to every
passing brawl in the crowd, but the death-
cry never came and as the evening went by
hope died ; she wished she had gathered the
purple swamp-berries that give eternal sleep
—better the grave than share Gimori’s
sleeping mat!
The feet of the brides were dragging now;
soon the old women would come with tap-
ping lcapas to lead them to their waiting
mates in the dubu.
Henau had disappeared early in the even-
A DAY WIITH THE BIRDS.
ing, and as the parade shuffled past Gimori’s
hut again Evea savy that he, too, had gone;
perhaps he was waiting now in the dubu to
claim her. Fear struck chill in her heart.
A sly hand tugged at her arm. It was
Henau at her side, pacing with her, whis-
pering in her ear, “Kaipu waits at the
sandspit to crown thee. It is done.”
“Who?” breathed Evea.
“Gimori!” came in a sibilant hiss, and
as they passed into the shadow of the last
house in the village, Henau threw a tapa-
cloth cloak over the girl and drew her
deeper into the gloom ; so they glided swiftly
away from the turmoil into the silent track
to the river.
A full moon—the marriage-moon—hung
over the crowns of the tossing palms, dap-
pling the path with patches of black and
silver. After the heat and glare and clamor
of the village, the river seemed eerily silent
and cold as the two women, like dark
spirits of the night, joined the waiting
Kaipu.
Henau’s aged, sluggish blood was pulsing
afresh with the excitement and joy of in-
trigue—life was so dull these times. Her
eyes gleamed bright with avarice—an arm-
shell for a few lies ! She pushed Evea towards
the waiting man. “Quick!” she urged.
“Paddle as though Kovave, the Ford of
Spirits, himself pursued thee. Once in thy
father’s dubu thou art safe, Kaipu, so give
me my price and go,” and she pointed to on?
of Evea’s broad bracelets.
The girl hung back. “The proof?” she
demanded. “How do I know thou hast not
lied to me?”
Kaipu picked up a. bundle—something
round, wrapped in grass, from which slow
drips oozed and fell. He tossed it far out
into the river, where it dropped with a dull
splash. “There’s thy proof. Come, my bride,
we must hasten.”
Evea stripped a toia from her arm and,
placing it in Henau’s greedy clutch, stepped
into the canoe.
Kaipu paddled vigorously down stream, the
bright moonlight clearly showing the broad
waters ahead, and Evea sank down ex-
hausted by the exciting, wearying evening.
She studied the man as he stood erect,
wielding the heavy paddle. Rumor had il
he was an idle wastrel, a good-for-nothing
loafer living on his father’s bounty, but he
was better than the old reptile whose head
was now food for fishes; even though the
tightly-laced bark belt girdling his waist was
overhung with unsightly rolls of flesh and no
swelling muscles rippled under his tawny
skin. All men were idlers now, save when a
feast called for meat. They all lived on their
women’s labors, selling the sago for tobacco.
As Henan said, there were no warriors now,
except the Government policemen—the only
men to wear the token. She wished she
could have seen the sergeant with those
three red stripes on his arm; the three
tokens of his prowess. Three killings ! What
a man ! Still, she could now wear the yellow
crest and silence the taunts of spiteful,
gibing tongues.
The noise of drums and the roaring boom
of lcibis was faint now. Night birds were
calling in the bush. Myriads of fireflies flick-
ered mistily in the thorny thickets, illumin-
ing the river banks with a wavering, illusive
light. Three great white pelicans asleep
on a floating log awoke and flew silently
away, spectral and ghostly.
Evea thought she heard a faint sound as
of shouting far away and turned to look
back. Straining her eyes, she saw the shin-
ing, moon-drenched surface of the river
broken by a moving speck, and as their little
canoe swept into Kupiri Creek she knew they
were pursued.
Kaipu, too, had heard that faint shout,
and, grounding the canoe, dragged her hur-
riedly up the quiet street, saying breathlessly,
“The old woman has betrayed us. It is
Gimori!”
Evea pulled back, but he dragged her
ruthlessly on.
“Gimori?” she shrieked. “How can that
bo? His head is in the river."
“A _ cocoanut wrapped in grass! The
old witch thought to cheat me, but I saw
it. Yet you were worth the armshell.”
The sleeping village awoke; heads peered
from hut doorways and sleepy voices were
raised in frightened, angry queries.
_ Once in the dubu, after a brief word with
his drowsy father, Kaipu blew the Jcibi, and
soon they were the centre of an excited
crowd. Word passed round that Kaipu had
stolen Gimori’s bride from the marriage
feast and the men of Marua were on their
way to wrest her back. In that hour those
men of Kupiri forgot that Kaipu was a
wastrel, an idler; he was one of them, a
brother; shoulder to shoulder, with club and
spear, they mustered to stand by him.
Evea eyed them sullenly as they greedily
appraised her bridal wealth. She was be-
tween two evils —she must wed this lying
cheat or return to Gimori’s odious embrace.
A war canoe vomited forth a crowd of yell-
ing men. Feather head-dresses waving, pubic
shells gleaming white, painted faces working
savagely in the moonlight, they raced up the
village street and leapt on to the dubu
platform, armed to the teeth.
The men of Kupiri had retreated within,
breaking down the matting screen, so that
the great arching front yawned black and
ominous; but a tiny fire flickering on a
clay hearth within dimly lighted Evea as she
stood, a slim figure of despair.
The Marua men parted, and Gimori,
crooked and malevolent, limped into the fire-
light, demanding her return. Shaking his
fist in Kaipu’s face he threatened him. “Wait
till the sergeant comes, I’ll make court and
have thee gaoled,” he piped in tremulous
anger, and seized Evea’s arm.
One of Kaipu’s friends raised his club
and sprang forward with a shout. The
girl became the centre of a struggling, scuf-
fling mass of men.
A tongue of flame, a deafening crash fol-
lowed as a shot rang out and the tang of
acrid smoke filtered through the dubu.
In an instant every hand fell. Struggling
men scrambled apart and with frightened
faces gazed at the moonlit entrance.
Silhouetted against that silver background
was the dark , figure of a man, bending for-
ward, peering into the dim interior.
There was a tense silence, then a crisp
command, “Make more light, and quickly.”
Friend and foe hastened to obey, tumbling
over each other in their haste to throw dry
twigs and leaves on the dying fire. i
Into the flaring blaze of light stalked
Sergeant Siwaga, rifle at the ready; on its
tip a bright steel bayonet shining. His
face was wrathful and his eyes flickered sav-
agely, glaring hither and yon.
“Have the old days returned that
I find you fighting?” he demanded
sternly. “Have the laws been for-
gotten?”
Evea escaped from Gimori’s
clutch and threw herself at the
sergeant’s feet, clasping his bare
ankles and burying her face in his
serge sulu, gasping, “Save me, Ser-
geant ! Save me!”
He raised her to her feet and,
motioning back the crowd of ex-
plaining men, listened with judicial
calm, first to Gimori’s clamorous
claims and her father’s excited
harangue; then to Kaipu’s sulky
assertion that the girl had beguiled
him into bringing her.
“Now thy tale, little dove,” said
Siwaga gently. “Fear not, little
one. I seek only the truth.” So
she told him of her loathing of
Gimori and of Kaipu’s deception.
“Then thou desirest neither man?
Neither old nor young?” lie ques-
tioned, looking down into her im-
ploring eyes. Who knows what
message those eyes flashed to his
as she clung to his arm, her slim
brown fingers gently stroking the
three red braid chevrons on his
sleeve?
“N either!” she answered.
“Rather death than either of them.”
He turned to Gimori. “Youth
and age are ill mates, old man.
Thou are too old for so fair a
flower. Go, rest content with thy
three old wives.”
Evea, hastily stripipng off her
ornaments, laid them in a heap at
Gimori’s feet, swiftly returning to
her protector’s side.
He turned now to Kaipu, who
was shuffling uneasily. “As for
thee, thou art a thief and a liar,”
he said. “The gaol floor shall be
thy marriage bed.” He motioned
to Warupi, the village policeman,
who was hovering in the back-
ground ; and as Kaipu tried to
slink away, there was a click of
handcuffs.
Evea’s father now laid a heavy
hand on his daughter’s shoulder;
but the sergeant drew him aside
and, taking a little sheaf of notes
from his pouch, pressed them into
the man’s willing hand. “I have
neither toias nor mairis,” he said,
"but these will buy thee many.”
Then raising his voice, “Come,
folks,” he cried, “we are all friends
now. The drums still beat, men of
Marua; the dance goes on, men of
Kupiri. Eet us all escort the bride
back to her marriage feast; and as
a bride must have a ’groom, why—
I’ll marry her myself!” With a
sweep of his brawny arms he gath-
ered the girl up and, setting her
on his shoulder, stepped out into the light
of the marriage-moon.
Evea, with little joy-birds trilling in her
heart, drew 7 the karai’s crown from its hiding
place, shook out its crumpled plumage and
triumphantly bound it on her forehead.

The March.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHO set the trees to climb tins hill
A hundred thousand years ago
Only the air, remembering still,
On days of utter calm may know.
Slope beyond slope the ranges sped
In folds that caught the yellow sun;
Across the cliffs of brown and red
The quiet evening lights were spun.
Far off the plain lay wide and dim.
Each serpent-river’s gleaming coil,
Each brook that autumn storms could brim
Made rich the leagues of waiting soil.
Then came the word. In eager green
The trees upsprang. At that high call
Close rank on rank their plumes were seen
On stony ridge and sandstone wall.
They shouted in the windy light,
They whispered in the lisping rain ;
The bark that fell at deep of night
Murmured. “The plain, the plain, the
plain!”
Root forward, drinking in the dew,
Branch forward, grasping for the sun,
Onward and plainward still they grew,
Their hope unquenched, their goal unwon.
Not yet they touch the level land,
Not yet they bathe in western streams;
Yet in their hearts is one command
That thrills them in their leafy dreams.
Oh tall tree-people, marching far,
The sap is strong in bough and stem.
The plains sleep under sun and star —
Your new and brown Jerusalem.
Oh people of a taller thought,
On whose warm hearts fall grander rains,
The years of toil were not for naught
Behold the rivers and the plains!

HOMING CLUBMAN (to policeman ): “Would one of you two gen’lemen mind sheeing
me home?”
observer has yet visited this part of Aus-
tralia. I am more glad than I can say that
I persuaded my host to let me make this
expedition.”
“ ’Struth, this is nothing to what you get
further north,” cut in Bill. “There’s little
dogs living amongst the blue bush that
carry their pups in pouches like kangaroos;
and there’s kangaroos that climb trees and
fishes that walk on the dry ground. But
theyTe nothing”....
“Nothing!” interrupted the zoologist,
“Why”....
Bill silenced him with a wave of his hand.
Bill’s attitude towards the famous scien-
tist I noticed with amusement, was that or
a tolerant adult to some precocious child:
kind but firm. u
“They’re nothing,” Bill went on, com-
pared with an animal I found up beyond the
Gascoyne towards the South Australian
border. Remarkable. Would you like to
hear about it?” , „ ~ ~
“I should be deeply interested, said the
zoologist.
Bill lighted hi 3. pipe by dropping a rea-
hot ember into the bowl with his fingers,
then obtained a comfortable purchase on the
snakewood-tree with his back.
“Well,” he commenced, “at the time what
I’m going to tell you about happened, I
was in charge of an outcamp on a cattle-
run. The bit of territory I looked after ran
into seventy- or eighty-thousand acres, maybe
more. There was no fences, of course; the
cattle suited theirselves where they went;
and it was my job to keep ’em in bounds,
so to speak.
“Now, on the eastern boundary ot my
territory the run ended against a range of
mountains that no one, so far as I know,
has ever explored. Talk about wild and
rugged ! —you’ve no idea what them mount-
ains was like. The Ronely Mountains we
called ’em; but I don’t think that was their
real moniker. They seemed to be flat on the
top, and the sides was so thick with scrub
you couldn’t get up ’em.
“Well, my outcamp was about thirty miles
in from the base of these mountains. I lived
there on my lonesome, and went into the
homestead about every two months for stores:
I’d been there about six months before I
seen any trace of this here animal ; then one
day I noticed some tracks near a soak at
the base of the mountains, where the ground
was soft. Something like kangaroo tracks
they was, only twenty or thirty, maybe
fifty, times the size. And there was furrers
in the ground, like a team had dragged a tree-
trunk along the ground. I couldn’t make
head nor tail of ’em. I tried to foller ’em
up, but they went this way and that way.
and there was no puzzling them out at all.
After that I kep’ me eyes open- and seen
the same tracks in other places. Then I
began to see them near the hut; but never
did I catch a sight of the animal.
“This went on until one night I woke
up of a sudden and heard an almighty bang
outside the hut, follered by a sound like a
railway engine giving off steam. I sprung
up quick and grabbed me gun ; but by the
time I got outside there was nothing there,
only a sound like a steam-engine galloping
through the scrub in the distance. Next
morning I seen them same tracks in front of
the hut and follered ’em right back to the
foot of the mountains. After that I began
to get a bit windy, and always carried me
gun with me.
“After a bit the idea of this bloke hanging
about out there sorter got on. me nerves,
and I decided to go and report it at the
homestead, so one morning I went after me
horse as usual. And, believe me, that very
morning I seen it —in a gully. It was a
long, narrer gully, with steep sides, and I
was walking down it to a flat at the other
end, where I could hear the horse-bells.
Then suddenly I happened to look up, and
there was this Thing sitting up on its hind
legs looking at me. It seemed to fill the
whole gully. I just stood as though someone
had taken a twitch in me backbone, and me
hair nearly lifted the hat off me head. We
just stood and stared at one another. I’ll
never forget it, never. I couldn’t move;
yet I was never so anxious to run in me
life.”
“My God! What was it like ?” The zoolo-
gist leaned forward. His face was white
with excitement, and I noticed his fingers
were dug deep into the soft earth.
“Huge,” said Bill, “like his tracks. He
sat up there like a lull, it seemed to me then,
like a greenery-yallery lull, and stared at me
with dull sort of eyes the size of soup plates,
He’d a great long neck and a tiny head in
comparison with the rest of him, and a great
pot-bellied body and a long spiky tail, with
hind legs like a kangaroo, only much stronger
and thicker looking. Bli’me, he was a queer-
looking cow.”
“By the Lord Harry,” cried the zoologist,
“it can’t be!” Behind thick lenses his
eyes glinted strangely. “Yet it sounds like
one of the Iguanodons —Mantelli or Bernis-
sartcnsis. Or possibly one of the Dinosaurs.
Could they have existed in those mountains?
What a possibility!” He turned to Bill.
“Did it have a sort of beak-like mouth?”
“Yes,” replied Bill.
“And did it have five fingers at the end of
its forefeet, with a long claw-like appendage
corresponding to the thumb?”
“Sure,” answered Bill. "I noticed that
particular.”
ALL IMPERFECT.
“My husband is a monomaniac.”
“Oh, my dear, they all have something wrong with them; mine’s a Mason.”
“ Mantelli,” said the zoologist in an awed
voice. “It must be—unless it’s a new
species. My God, what will the Royal
Society say to this ? In Australia, too.
Where’s my confounded notebook?”
The zoologist wiped a few beads of per-
spiration from his forehead and then pulled
a bulky notebook from his breast pocket,
found a blank page and wrote swiftly.
Afterwards, as Bill told his story, he made
copious notes. Sometimes, when the lire
burned down, he poked his huge bald head
almost into it to get enough light. Occasion-
ally he made a surprised ejaculation or asked
a question.
“Go on, man, go on,” he cried excitedly.
“Presently,” said Bill, who hadn’t moved
an inch “he made a sort of dab at me with
his head. With that I let out a yell and fired
the rifle. Then I hardly know what hap-
pened. It seemed to rise up in the air above
me, and I dropped the gun and ran for it.
It landed just behind me; but I didn t stop
to look behind. I run like the pistons of
Hell. And thump ! thump ! thump ! behind
me come that Thing. I _ could feel the
ground tremble with the weight of it. Gou
A’mighty, there’s never been a
skareder man since men was made.
“Finally, dead beat, I tripped
over a root and lay still. Nothing
happened for a bit, and I lay there
wondering if it’d kill me straight
off or nibble little bits off of me.
Then I felt a hot air-blast led on
to me that nearly blew me off of
the ground, and something dabbed
me in the buttocks. ‘This is the
end,’ I thinks. But nothing hap-
pened, though I could hear the
thing grunting and snuffling above
me. I must have lain there for
fifteen minutes, going through all
the horrors of Hell. But still no-
thing happened, so I screwed me
head round and there it was sitting
over the top of me, looking at me in
a puzzled hopeless sort of a way.
There was nothing savage or wild
about it; it looked sort of gentle
and kind, for all its size. It re-
minded me of an outsize rabbit with
a secret sorrer.”
“That’s so,” said the scientist,
writing busily; “they are herb-
ivorous.” *
“All right, continued Bill, have
it your own way. Anyroad, then
and there I took a sort of fancy to the thing.
It looked kind of lonely, as though it really
wanted a mother to look after it. I christened
it Little Mary on the spot; and afterwards I
found I was right.”
“Right about what?” asked the Professor.
“Its sex,” said Bill, “it was a skirt.
“Wore a skirt, did you say?” ejaculated
the scientist, in a startled voice.
“No, I mean it was a female, replied
BiH. ’ .
“Well, I reached up and patted her knee;
but she took no offence. Presently I started
to slope off. And blow me if she didn t stai t
follering me, droring herself along on all
four feet, like you see a kangaroo some-
times. She follered me along as quiet and
gentle as you please all the way back to
camp. By the time we got there we was
quite matey, and I wondered how Id
ever been frightened of her. She hung about
so loving that after the novelty wore off I
got a bit tired of her ; but she wouldn’t go
away. Suddenly something seemed to startle
her and she slewed round sudden and brought
her whacking great tail up against the hut
with a bang. I tell you, the bump knocked
that hut out by the roots, and it never
stopped rolling till it got to the other side
of the flat. I was damned annoyed about it.
But what could I do?
“I didn’t feel like doing any work that
day, so I mucked about and baked a damper
and put up the but again; and all day she
hung round me, sometimes just staring at
me and sometimes cropping the tops off the
trees round about.
“Next morning she was still there. As
soon as I got outside she come frisking
up to me like a playful elephant, only she
was bigger than any elephant; and I was
mortal afraid all the time she might frisk
on top of me or catch me with her tail like
she did the hut. It made me feel sort of
small to have her hanging round. I tried to
drive her away, but I might as well have
tried to scare off a granite outcrop. Then
I decided to get my horse and ride into the
homestead.
“Well, I went out after me horses; but
that confounded animal follercd me like a
dog. And when the horses seen Little Mary
they just snorted and galloped off for the
lick of their lives. I never seen ’em again.
“As it happened, I was pretty well out of
stores; and then I didn't know what the
cattle might be doing. In fact, things was
getting serious. After a few days that
great silly beast hanging about all the time
began to get on me nerves. She never left
me for a minute. Then one day as she was
feeding I dumb up her tail and stood on toy
of her back; and she didn’t seem to mind.
“That give me an idea; so I went and got
a good length of quarter-inch rope and a
trace-chain. The trace-chain I twitched on
to the base of her neck pretty tight with a
piece of wire, and then tied an end of
the rope to either side —for reins, d’ye see?
In the middle of her back was several deep
wrinkles, and sitting in between a couple
of these I had as comfortable a seat as you
could wish for.
“Then I started to break her in as a
saddle-hack, which wasn’t quite so hard as
you might believe. The difficulty at first was
to make her go. Spurs she never seemed to
feel at all, and you could belt a stick to
pieces on her hide and it only sort of tickled
her. Then I wrapped barbed-wire round the
end of a long stick and hit her a clout on
the soft spot under her forearm.
“Bli’me, I’ll never forget the first time
I done it. She jumped about thirty feet in
the air and. then set off through the bush
about fifty mile an hour. The countryside
fair whizzed past, and the force of the wind
nearly blew me off her back; but I stuck on
like flypaper. After that I broke her into the
rein, and at the end of a week I could do
anything with her and guide her as easy
as an old stock-horse. She seemed to enjoy
it, too. By that time I was broke into
the motion of her, and could sit on her
back as comfortable as you sit on the
cushions of a motor-car. And she simply ate
up distances. With a horse it took me
several days to get round me boundaries:
with her, I was round ’em in a few hours.
“Then I decided to take her into the home-
stead. It was a distance of seventy-odd miles
from the outcamp; but with an early start
we was there just as the musterers was
saddling up. I was so used to Little Mary
by this that I’d forgot that she might seem
a bit strange to other people. So when Mary
come hopping down the road and lep over the
horse-paddock gate with six feet to spare she
caused what you might call a stir.”


Bill slowly puffed at his pipe for several
seconds with a meditative gleam in liis eyes.
“ ‘Struth, you got no idea what a stir we
did cause. The mustcrers’ horses broke in
all directions like a mob of emus, and inside
two minutes were well down on the horizon,
still going like the hammers of Hell. Some
of the stockmen got slung to blazes. A
yammagi was just bringing the dairy herd
into the stockyard, and they turned and run
quicker’n I’ve ever seen milkers run before.
Several quiet old hacks in the stockyard
jumped clean over the rails. And then there
was a camel-team with a load of chaff tliat’d
been camping the night at the homestead.
The way that team bolted, nearly wrecking
the store when the waggon caught a corner
of it, and scattering bags of chaff behind ’em
right and left, was a thing to make a dingo
laugh. Even the dogs went bush. As for
the abos.! —from the old man of the tribe
to the smallest piccaninny they let out one
almighty ‘Yocci' and beat it for the bush.
Inside five minutes the place might have been
a howling wilderness for all the signs of life
there was.
“I dumb off Little Mary and sat down
on her tail for a smoke. In about quar-
ter of an hour blokes began to crawl out
of holes and burrers all over the joint. Then
they seen me and come over; but it was a
long time before I could persuade ’em to
come anywhere near Little Mary. The boss
was a bit snakeheaded about it, especially as
they couldn’t get any of the stock horses
near the place. But with Mary I done all
the work there was to be done and give the
stockmen a holiday.
“But she never become popular,” con-
tinued Bill, shaking his head sadly. “They
was always suspicious about her. One of
the stockmen disappeared, and they all said
Mary’d ate him. I told ’em she was a vege-
tarian ; but they wouldn’t believe me. They
found out afterwards the stockman ’d only
gone away for a bender; but it sort of
spoiled Mary’s reputation. Then there was
the Chinese cook. Mary was just skipping
about playful one night, when she happened
to sit on this here cook and squashed him so
flat they had to prize him off the ground
with a crowbar. I told them it was only
her playful way, and there was no vicious-
ness about her. But they never trusted her.
“Then the owner come up in his car, and
he took a dislike to her. She was very play-
ful, as I’ve told you, and one day she fol-
lered the owner’s car, never having seen one
before. Being a suspicious sort of bloke,
he mistook her motives, which was altogether
blameless. Anyroad, he stepped on the accele-
rator, and she just hopped along behind
gentle and easy, smiling up her sleeve at
the idea of that little thing in front trying
to race her. The owner said he was doing
seventy-five just before the motor went over
the cliff into the river, and Mary was still
loping along easy behind him. Marvellous
turn of speed she had. But you got no idea
how annoyed the owner was about it. Vin-
dictive, you might say. If he hadn’t broke
his leg and put his shoulder out I reckon he’d
have shot her.”
Bill paused and shook his head sadly, then
knocked the dottle out of his pipe and slowly
commenced to refill it.
“Don’t keep us in suspense,
man; what became of the
animal?” asked the zoologist
impatiently.
“She died,” replied Bill with
a sigh. “One morning we
found her lying dead, with her
head in a tank, in front of the
new homestead the boss’d built
for his bride. It was a big
cement and iron, tank, full of
water, d’ye see, and there was
only a small manhole at the top.
I reckon Mary must have put
her head in to get a drink, and
then found she couldn’t get
it out again. The boss’d
gone into Roebourne to get
his wife, so no one heard her
struggles.
A MATTER FOR INQUIRY.
“Is that you, William?”
“I shink sho, dearesht, but I don’t feel like
my (hie) shelf at all.”
“You got no idea how big she looked when
she was dead. A reg’lar mountain of flesh.
She was much too big to shift or burn, and
after a couple of hot, thundery days you
couldn’t get within quarter of a mile of the
windward of her. Rich —any other stink
I’ve run into was roses and lavender to her
when she got properly under way. The boss
couldn’t get nearer than a couple of hundred
yards of the homestead when he brung back
his bride, and his remarks singed the grass
and withered the leaves on the trees. He
talked to me for quarter of an hour, and
only stopped then because he bust a blood-
vessel.”
“But what happened to the animal?” inter-
rupted the zoologist eagerly. “Was the skele-
ton saved?”
“I don’t think so,” replied Bill. “ I wasn’t
there meself, being called south the day after
the boss got back. But from what I’ve heard
no one was able to get near her for months,
during which time the boss and his missus
lived in a tent at the top of the horse-
paddock. Even the musterers had to get out
of their quarters every time the wind shifted.
In the end Little Mary was sawed up and
dragged away and burned.”
“God in Heaven,” cried the zoologist,
“what a crime! Surely they saved some-
thing—a bone, a tooth”
“Not so much as a toenail,” concluded
Bill. “They reckon the boss said he didn’t
want anything at all to remind him of her.”
* * * *
I have since examined many papers in an
attempt to find some report written by the
zoologist about Little Mary; but I have
never seen a single reference, scientific or
otherwise, to the remarkable story which,
to the best of my ability, I have set out above
as Bill Hoskins told it.
F. RHODES FARMER.
The Perfect Crime.
é
swindler, how pleased Mal-
lock and Canning were, and
how they chaffed me, who
had at first considered this
the perfect crime at last.
“Well, you’ve got your man
again, Sergeant, and I was
wrong,” I adrpitted. “He
was supposed to be the
cleverest rogue that ever
skipped to the colonies, but
he bungled this job badly.
It promised to be the perfect
crime, but the fool forgot
that the girl was trained and
intelligent, and obviously
would think of tapping the
wire.”
“There’s no such thing as
the perfect crime,” said Mal-
lock seriously. “The most
calculating rogues of them
all invariably omit some de-
tail or overdo some detail.
There’s always some little
clue for us to start on.”
“You speak from the police
standpoint,” said I. “Why
should not the criminal
brain be as thorough some-
times as the police brain?
Theoretically, of course, the
perfect crime is possible.”
“Theoretically, perhaps,”
put in Canning, “but some-
how it doesn’t happen. It
never works out. I’ve had
a few hard nuts in my time,
and there’s always something forgotten or
overlooked, some new development not
foreseen and not prepared for. Half a
postage-stamp got the forger Harraway 15
years, thanks to Mallock here. A square inch
of blotting-paper hanged Dilkes, you remem-
ber.”
“Well, but neither of these was the per-
fect crime. There was no excuse for that
stamp; the discarded blotting-paper was a
bungle.”
“Murder will out, Wingard,” said the
sergeant stubbornly.
“I can’t see why it must necessarily be so,
any more than in arson or burglary,” I
persisted. “Why should it?”
“Well, ’tis hard to explain, but maybe ’tis
a dispensation of Providence agen the mur-
derer,” said an Irish D, one of Mallock’s
best men.
But I w r as not satisfied, and many an even-
ing we came back to the same old argument.
Then, as if to confound them and their
theory, came the dreadful Powell case, the
perfect crime.
Albert Powell in the ’nineties was a -well
known wealthy figure in the city, famous
rather than popular. He had a finger (not
unsoiled) in many financial pies, he had
interests in several doubtful schemes and
companies, and he was a bit of a cad in
THE FRAGILE SEX.
GLADYS: “Auntie doesn’t like me going out at nights without a chaperon.”
BERYL: “Well, I suppose she’s right. Boys have to be so careful of their reputation
these times.”
private life, but lie had never come up
against the law.
It was in ’97, I remember, the year of
the old Queen’s Diamond Jubilee, that Powell
got sick and delirious and sent a note to
the police saying that his life was in danger,
and that he was being poisoned. A suc-
cession of nurses and doctors —for he was
always changing them —declared that the
man knew he was dying and was morbidly
afraid of death ; that there was no suspicion
whatever of foul play, and that his mono-
mania was the result of a bad disease and
a bad conscience. All the same, both Mal-
lock and Canning paid many visits to the
small private hospital in the suburbs where
Powell was a patient, and I was there several
times, to take samples of medicines for
analysis. Canning and I were there the day
Powell was murdered.
I had seen him about fifteen minutes before
the end. I had left him with his young
daughter and a clergyman he had asked to
see, and shortly afterwards they came out of
the sickroom with the nurse and joined me
in the tiny kitchen-diningroom next door,
where morning tea had been set out for us.
Canning was prowling about downstairs
among the servants at the time, as was his
custom. We were only a few minutes seated
at the table when there was the startling
whir of the alarm clock on the patient’s
bedside table. It made us all jump.
“Good God! What is it?” I said, starting
up.
I rushed back into the sickroom and the
others came after me. The next minute we
were standing together hy Powell’s bed, and
we knew at once that he had been murdered.
There was no mystery about how he had
met his end. The skull had been smashed
by a terrible blow on the head, and a short-
handled hammer lay on the counterpane.
We stood spellbound, looking down at the
ghastly sight till the screaming alarm at last
stopped suddenly. The nurse made a move
to lift the hammer, but I prevented her.
“No,” I said. “Inspector Canning is
below and nothing must be moved or even
touched till he comes. The man is dead,
Nurse; it’s no good attending to him now.”
We sent the terrified little girl down for
Canning, and no one moved till he came
in. The door leading in from the dining-
room had been ajar, and both the other
doors of the sickroom were locked with the
keys inside, by Powell’s orders. One glance
at the high windows convinced us that a
visitor could hardly have made so quick
an entrance or exit that way, though it
was not impossible. There was a square
trapdoor in the ceiling at one corner, but
it looked undisturbed, and we had been on
the spot within a few seconds of the first
alarm.
Within a very few hours Canning had a
team of his best men on the case, and it
became the theme of our speculations when-
ever he and Mallock and myself fore-
gathered in the evenings in the little C.I.D.
den. which for a time was not often. It
was a revelation to me the way these two
got to work, the facts they unearthed, the
clues they followed up. There were severe
cross-examinations. Men owed Powell
money, men were in his power, shady part-
ners had a motive for getting rid of him,
his wife, atrociously treated by him, had a
motive. He had been a bad husband and
father, a bad friend, a treacherous partner.
There seemed a multiplicity of motives, a
round dozen of suspects.
At first there was no talk among us of
the perfect crime here, baffling as it was,
There were so many threads worth taking
up and following. But, as the days passed,
each liksly clue led Canning and his men up
against blank walls, and after a little the
Powell murder case no longer figured in the
city papers.
I was much toe upset at first to use this
ghastly business in justifying my idle argu-
ment, but after several weeks of fruitless
police activity I found myself able to
chuckle in that little C.I.D. den at the dis-
comfiture of Canning and his mate. This
certainly looked like the Perfect Crime at
last —an audacious and simple piece of work
leaving no loose ends.
Even after twelve months, when the affair
was almost forgotten, we would come back
to the same subject, and I knew that both
Mallock and Canning were still keen as
hounds to follow up the faintest scent. We
talked of it as the Perfect Crime, and either
of the friendly sleuths would have given a
limb, I believe, to have out-manceuvred and
trapped the murderer of Powell.
Well, Canning is dead now, and Mallock,
grown old like myself, has long retired on a
well deserved pension to his little suburban
rose-garden. They were the keenest brains
in the Criminal Investigation Department,
but the Powell case baffled them both.
They will never know, but I know. It
was I ivho hilled Albert Powell.
There is a strange satisfaction now in
putting down my secret thoughts at last,
hidden away for all these years. I have but
one regret—Canning at least will never
know. And when this is found among my
papers at last, perhaps Mallock, too, will
be beyond all telling.
Ah, how we used to sit and argue, we
three, about the practicability of the perfect
crime! And how I have had the laugh on
them at last!
It was all very simple. I think the idea
had worked within me for a long time; for
a long time I was ready, I think, to take
advantage of any exceptional opportunity.
And then the unique opportunity came. Yet
if Powell had not been already a dying man,
if he had not been a worthless creature
who knows?
They had really begun the argument,
those two. They had fascinated me with
the idea. I can remember yet the extraor-
dinary pleasure the planning gave me, the
planning of every detail. And now for
thirty years I have listened to the discus-
sions, the theories....
It was I who, as a medical man, had
seen to the changing of the bed’s position
from opposite the door to one side and
against the wall, a little out of sight. I
brought the hammer in my medical bag, and
in the one little space of time that I con-
trived to be alone with the dozing, semi-
conscious patient, I thrust that hammer
under the bed and wound and set the alarm.
It was a few minutes to ten in the morn-
ing then, and I set the thing for a quarter-
past. I had to judge the time, I had to
be content to waive the occasion if necessary,
and leave the alarm and the hammer to ex-
plain themselves afterwards as best they
could. No harm would have been done.
When the nurse brought in the clergy-
man and the child I was careful to leave
the room before they did —they were the last
ones present with him. And, as I expected,
they came out again before the quarter-hour
was up, to join me at morning tea.
I sat with my back to the sickroom door,
and I invited the little girl to sit beside me.
The other two chairs were on the opposite
side of the table. When the alarm went oft
I was more ready than they; the nurse and
the clergyman had to come round the table
to follow me into Powell’s room. The child.
I knew, would hesitate; it was the nurse
I was anxious about.
At the inquest later on it was stated that
when the alarm sounded, probably the
sick man’s way of telling the household that
an enemy was in the room or climbing m,
we all rose from the table and rushed m.
That was so, but in reality I had just a
few short seconds before the others came:
and the bed was away at one side, behind
the door when it opened.
The alarm, which gave the excuse for
rushing in, also drowned the sound ot any
blow. So the world heard how. when the
alarm was given, we all rushed in too late.
They say the old grow garrulous. Some
day, perhaps, I shall not resist the tempta-
tion to tell Mallock the solution of the
problem. Whenever I pass his gate we
talk of the Powell case of more than thirty
years ago, but I notice that now at last he
is no longer interested. He looks at me as
if wondering why I come back to that old
subject again so abruptly. He is now more
interested in his roses.

[FOR THE BULLTIN.]
OLD Mimbles sighed and tapped his pipe
out. From his chair on the narrow
stone-paved verandah he could see the
coal-and-wood yard where lie had worked for
50 years. He had been a hoy in knickerbockers
when he had asked old Pat Mullaney for a
job here. He could remember the day as if
it was yesterday —a fine bright day 50 years
ago. The ’Loo had been different then; some
high-class people had lived there then. The
gardens in Cathedral-street and round about
the top end in those old times would compare
with anything in the flash suburbs now.
And in the lower end, too ; many a time he d
pinched a bellyful of apples over the fences
on his way to work.
The old times—God lie with old times
He had been somebody then. He remembered
the kick that came into life the day the
business became his own; far away in those
times lie saw himself sitting on the shaft ot
the new cart —the only cart a rose m his
mouth and the world under his dangling teet.
\t the yard gate Mum had laughed at lnm,
but he’d seen the look in her eyes. lie
knew she was thinking the same thing as he
was, whether she laughed or cried.
For a long moment old Mimbles’s eyes
watching the past were veiled. You couldn t
have told what he was thinking about.
Mum’s voice brought him back to these
times. Mum’s voice was resonant and full;
there" was nothing drowsy or old about it.
“Daphne! Dapli-nee !”
Impregnable silence followed the call.
“My word, my lady, I’ll warm your ide
for you.” Mum spoke trenchantly into the
silence. “You can hear me all right. Dapli-
"e“Yairs?” came sleepily from the far end
of the yard.
“Come up ’ere !” .
“Orright, Gran. In a minut.
“In a minut!” Mum’s mutter was full of
indignant scorn. “Come up note!” she
cried.
The* sound of pattering obedient feet filled
in the pause, and presently a little girl stood
at the verandah-step. “Yes, Gran? she said
dutifully.
Mum’s strong eyes searched her face.
“Did you take your oil last night t she
demanded. * ~ .
Daphne’s face fell. No, Gran, she con-
fessed. “I forgot.” . ,„„
“You fergot! Did yer take it Sat dy !
“Oh yes —I took it Sat’d y, Daphne
hastened to assure her.
“Well for you you did, Miss. Come and
have last night’s now. I’ll give it you me-
self an’ make sure you get it.” „
Daphne’s face wrinkled. Oh, Gran, she
pleaded, “not in the daytime. It —it spoils
it. so. Can’t I ’ave it to-night?”
Oil twice in three days did seem over
the odds; old Mimbles felt his own gorge
rising at the idea. “Look, Mum,” lie said,
“don’t yer think to-night’ll be time enough?
Ye know it’s bad enough at any time, but in
the middle of the afternoon it does seem -
The cold amazement and scorn in Mum’s
face made him fumble and cease.
“Lord save us,” she said at last. bmee
when have you known anything about dosing
children, Dad? You mind your own business
and see you don’t interfere with mine. Come
on, Daphne.”
That was the way of it now, he told him-
self. He was brushed aside as if lie was
nothing. And he was nothing. Life, like
the old times that could never come back,
had passed him by. He couldn’t even give
a bit of advice about a poor little kid and
her drop of oil. He was crowded out; that s
what it was. He’d had a sort of sleepy,
dizzy feeling come over him lately at times;
but did anybody make a fuss about dosing
him?
Of course, it suited Mum, all this raft of
children to boss and look after, and a bunch
of daughters and daughters-in-law to listen
to what she told them. The more the merrier
was Mum’s idea; so long as they did wliat
she told them. And people mostly did that.
She was a great one for putting people right,
was Mum. The veil shadowed his eyes again
for a moment as he stared a little drearily
at the jumbled yard. Passed him by the
old times and the middle times and the new
times all passed him by. He was like an
old ship that had suddenly run into a cove
and been forgotten. If he dared to push
his nose out for a second and say a word,
it was snapped off his face. He felt that
dizzy feeling shaking him again that was
another thing. They’d feel a draught if he
went sick on them, with all this crew s tucker
to get and all. You could sit on a man
when he had his health, and no harm done
.... but
The dizziness swept over him and passed.
When it had gone he remembered that they’d
teel no draught if he went sick. If he up
and died on them they wouldn’t notice it.
That was what he’d come to —“Mr. Mimbles,
of the coal-and-wood yard, known in the
’Loo for 50 years.” , , , ,
Mind his own business —he hadn t got any
business. There was a time when she’d been


glad enough for him to mind his business.
Aye, and proud enough, too.
A bleak, pinched look settled round his
mouth. Soon he was a drowsy old man
again, half-asleep in the warm shade of the
verandah and thinking of nothing.
A motor chugged hoarsely at the yard gate,
and his eyes opened. That was Pat with
the lorry. He covered a lot of ground with
the lorry and served customers in Darling-
hurst and Paddington, and as far out as
Waverley. Nobody said he didn’t; but you
couldn’t get away from the bills for repairs
and tyres and petrol, could you? And how
many bad debts did the yard write off every
year, with all this scattered business you
couldn’t keep an eye on? Pat was a worker,
and up to now he hadn’t done too badly; but
up to now wasn’t the end of the section,
as Pat would find out before another couple
of winters had gone by. But he wanted to
see Pat.
“Oh. Pat!”
Pat turned at the door and looked, his
eyes only half serious, at his father.
“Yes, Dad? I’m in a bit of a rush. Any-
thing serious?”
“What I’ve got to say about this business
is always serious, me boy. Come over here
a minute.”
The half-smile still lurking in Pat’s eyes,
he came over there and stood, friendly and
tall, beside Dad’s chair. “Well, Dad, what’s
on your mind—books won’t balance, or
what?”
“This new coal you ordered,” Mr. Mimbles
came to the point at once. “Where do you
think you’re going to sell it?”
“Oh. round about. I’ll sell it all right.”
“It’ll come dear for the general run of
customers. They’re not used to the price
we’ll have to put on it—not in the ’Loo
they’re not.”
Pat licked the paper of the cigarette he
was rolling and smiled at Mr. Mimbles. “The
’Loo isn’t the same as it used to be in your
day, Dad. They won’t put up with treacle-
and-soot like they did, you know. Bosker
day, isn’t it?”
“That’s all right, but will they pay the
difference? A shilling'll buy a lot of soft
coal, and they’ve been used to getting a
lot. This new coal’ll run out at pretty
near double the price, as far as I can
see”
“Do _ you know if Molly rang up to say
what time she’d be back?” Pat asked, a sud-
den thought evidently striking him.
Mr. Mimbles sat up, a certain definition
coming into his attitude. “Look, Pat,” he
said, “you can try to put me off as much as
you like, but I’ve been in this business
ionger than you have, and I trained you
in it. And I’m telling you that we’re going
to drop good money on this flash coal you’ve
ordered.”
Pat’s lazy, pleasant eyes continued to smile
at Dad. “Don’t worry, Dad. I ordered it
and I’ll sell it. You didn’t hear if Molly
rang up, did you?”
“No, I didn’t. And you mark my words
—we’ll find ourselves with half that coal on
our ’ands next summer.”
“Righto, Dad, Have it your own wav.”
Pat turned indifferently and walked down the
verandah. At the door lie looked back. “It
is a bosker day, isn’t it?”
There it was. Nothing in the house and
nothing in the business, the business he’d
made and built up so that it could feed and
look after this raft of children and women
and leave a bit over. Pat didn’t even trouble
SCORE ONE TO JAN.
“An’ what part do ’ee com’ from, Maister?”
“Gahd’s own country, boy.”
“Well, tha’s funny. I should never ’ave tak’d ’ee for a Coornishman."
to argue with him—young Pat! Many a
time he’d upended and spanked the kid.
What was the good of it? he asked him-
self wearily. Here he was, an old encum-
brance that nobody even bothered to listen
to, let alone look after and cosset a bit
when he wasn’t feeling too good. _
The world was a hard place. You couldn’t
get away from that, try as you might.
He’d given it a fair go—worked hard all his
life, and reared a large family, a damned
large family it was by now, and this was
what he got for it at the end. Crowded out
by a lot of women and kids, and given cheek
by a kid he’d spanked and trained.
It wasn’t good enough, he told himself,
his lips trembling a little. You’d only got to
look at the yard and the place to see what
he’d done for them all. llow would young
Pat have got on if there’d been no business
for him to run and give himself such airs
about? Where would all the free tucker
and lodging for this crew come from then?
Books won’t balance! Why, an hour a
week’d keep the books of this lot. That
was some more of Pat’s skite—keeping books.
What was the matter with taking the six-
pence or the shilling at the door—no six-
pence, no wood or coal? That was his way
of doing business; your books balanced them-
selves that way. Oh, but you can’t do it
that way now—not in these days, says
Mister Pat; you got to treat your customers
more respectful and not worry ’em. Send
in your account at the end of the month
like any other tradesman. Send in your
account!
Measureless scorn filled him for a moment:
but presently his lips quivered again. And
that was his job now—fiddling with the
books of the business he’d made. Something
for the old man to do, something to keep
him quiet and make him feel he was still
alive and not the old nuisance everybody
knew he was. And Mum—there’d be times
when she knew how he felt without his
opening his mouth: aye, and had him dosed
and looked after him before you could turn
round —just like he was somebody.
But that was long ago, he reminded him-
self drearily, when he was somebody
There was that row starting again. Every
afternoon, it didn’t matter who was trying
to have a quiet spell, that rumpus’d start in
the kitchen. Kids being got ready for then-
baths, Mum banging away at the beginnings
of tea, women yap-yapping at each other as
if they hadn’t got all day to mag in.
Mr. Mimbles glanced haggardly at the
yard and up at the sky. He’d get out of it
and go for a walk; that Bedlam of voices
and crockery and pots and pans was over the
odds.
Looking diffidently in at the kitchen door
to announce his intention, he only just
escaped being run down by Ada and a toilet-
jug of hot water.
“Look out, Dad,” she said sharply. “You
nearly got the lot. ’Pon my word, I seem
to be running into you fifty times a day
lately.”
Mum turned round from the stove, her
cold steady eyes on him. “Why can’t yer
keep out of the way?” she demanded. “You
might have had a kettleful of boiling water
over the girl. You’re nothing but an old
nuisance about the place.”
That finished it. She’d said it herself.
Somehow he found his way out into the
street and the long shadows of the after-
noon, though he couldn’t see the shadows
very clearly at first. It was hard—hard.
Mum ought to remember better than that.
It made him feel all helpless and gone, as
if he had already died on them and was
no longer there, walking a bit shakily along
these old streets.
By-and-bye the old streets laid their
familiar hands on his spirit in the comfort-
able way of the lazy ’Loo. Most of it was
changed, of course, and he would never
see it again with the eyes- of the old times
that were with God. But here and there
a corner, a doorway, the end of a bit of
wall flashed down his memoir to those un-
critical times, and for a warm moment he
was back in untroubled youth and manhood
again. The brown sandstone dust lay on
everything, the obscuring dust under which
the ’Loo hid its heart deeper year after year,
He knew that. But he knew, too, that over
there, where the new flats were going up
The man who changed a fiver at
the toll bridge —
And the woman.
so flash and quick, was the corner where
Deener’s pub had been, and where many a
pint had vanished dow T n his throat. Where
that bit of a shop was the old steps had been
before the streets were graded. Many a
time he’d met Mum at those steps and gone
walking down the lanes past the apple-trees
and the deep gardens with her, while she
listened to what he was going to do, the
somebody he was going to be. A wintry
smile flickered in his tired eyes as he remem-
bered—it had all been a fat lot of good,
hadn’t it?
Here was where the old schoolhouse had
been. Timmy Sims had bought the place
when the school had moved —built himself
a fine house and lived in it 20 3 ears before
it was burnt out. It had gone to rack and
ruin since—the land wouldn’t sell. It looked
like a broken garden now, forgotten flowers
and weeds and rubbish all jumbled together
inside the broken fence he was leaning on.
Memories crowded in on him. Over there,
in that corner, he’d stood up to young Billy
Regan until the blood from a cut eyebrow
had blinded him
A little girl crept through a hole in the
far fence. Suspending his memories old
Mimbles watched her. She glanced back
over her shoulder and made her cautious
way to a shrub, a shrub with dark, coppery
leaves. She looked all round to make sure
that no one saw her, plucked one of the
leaves, and put it in her mouth. Her eyes
closed, and she chewed the leaf, slowly and
with a certain deliberation, as if the chew-
ing were important. That done, her caution
abruptly vanished, and she kicked up her
heels and ran across the lot to a break in
the fence beside old Mimbles.
“What did you do that for?” he asked.
Her running figure stood still. “Do what?”
she said, caution and secrecy clothing her
again.
“Eat that leaf. I saw you,”
She looked at him and blushed, but re-
mained silent.
“I’m only asking you. There’s no catch
in it. Come on, my dear. What did you
do it for?”
Her eyes searched his face for confirma-
tion or denial of his trustworthiness. Pre-
sently they fell and she scratched the dust
with a broken shoe. “You won’t tell?”
“ ’Course I won’t. I’m only askin’ for
curiosity. Why did you chew a leaf o’ that
bush?”
Watching the scratching shoe, “It’s bitter-
sweet.” she murmured.
“Bittersweet? What’s that?”
“It—it’s a plant.”
He waited.
“And if you eat a leaf of it when the
sun is setting”——
“Well?”
“It makes your sweetheart love you,” she
told him with a rush.
Suddenly her eyes were staring into his
face. “But don’t you tell,” she admonished
him.
He laughed. “No, I won’t tell. You’re safe
with me, my dear.”
She blushed and kicked up her heels
again, and was gone.
Billy Regan went to Canada, so he'd
heard. He was a nice boy—a bit quick-
tempered but good-hearted. They did say
he was sweet on Polly Deener and cleared
out when she married that carroty fellow
from Perth; but you could never believe
what they said. More likely he just got
sick of it and restless, and cleared off on
his own. Anyhow, Polly wasn’t any oil-
painting to set two solid men by the ears
and drive one of them out of the country.
He found himself drifting through the
break in the fence and walking about that
vanished playground. There’d been a wall
there, where they played handball and yard-
cricket; over there old Elshnm used to
stand and glare at them on his way to the
classroom. And here
A brown, coppery leaf crossed his line of
vision. Glancing over his shoulder he saw
that the sun was near its setting. There
seemed to be no one about.
Suddenly he stooped, plucked the leaf, and
put it in his mouth. Bittersweet—a good
deal more bitter than sweet! He wiped his
lips, glanced furtively round once more, and
strolled out of the vanished playground.
This sort of half-light between sunset and
dusk suited him best; he was generally
pretty tired by now and looking forward to
tea and bed. It was a comfortable time of
day; the last hour or two before you could
hide yourself in the night and forget what
an old nuisance you were. You couldn’t
be irritating or bothering people when you
were safe in bed, and if they did laugh at
you it couldn’t worry you then.
It suited the ’Loo best, too. Standing
at the corner of Brazier-street he saw for
the thousandth time how the shabbiness
seemed gradually to get dimmer and dimmer.
In half an hour you wouldn’t know that
this was the old lazy hard-up ’Loo. The
place as it really was, full of all these
people and what tliev meant to do with
their lives, came to life again with every
dusk. You could feel it doing it—feel your-
self realising that the hard-up and the no-
good and the rest of it didn’t matter so
much in the long run. It made it more of a
comfortable time of day than ever, this did,
he reminded himself, stepping off the pave-
ment. You might have your own narks
and troubles, but if you could feel that there
might be a reason in
Brazier-street swept suddenly up into the
darkening sky as that dizziness seized and
shook him in the middle of the roadway.
Everything seemed to be slipping away from
him and yet crowding on to him; and there
was a great roaring in his ears. The roar-
ing seemed abruptly to concentrate in a
wild shout as a big black something.... And
he was old and a nuisance—why, even Mum
had.... And he was falling, falling....
It was cool and comfortable, like dusk in
the 'Loo —when had he been thinking about
that? But this coolness and quiet—ah, it
was the sheets, that’s what it was.
“Oh, no, he’ll be all right now, Mrs.
Mimbles.” That was Doctor Perry’s voice.
“He seems to have got a bit run down. A
little rest and cosseting is all he wants.
You’ve got so many young babies to look
after —you mustn’t neglect your old baby,
you know.”
Mum came over to the bed and straight-
ened the counterpane in a patting, tender
sort of way. Old Mr. Mimbles didn’t open
his eyes yet, but lie could feel that there
was something new and surprising in the
air.
“Gran! Gran!” sounded from the door.
The feeling in the room changed abruptly
and became terrible. He opened his eyes to
see Mum glaring like a tigress across the
bed. ‘‘You get o'ut of this room. Daphne,” she
said in a low, terrifying voice, “and don’t
come near it without I tell you. Don’t you
know your grandpa’s resting and mustn’t
be disturbed? Whose house do you think
this is?”
She turned to him and her eyes softened.
“Oh. Teddo, you did give me a turn.” For
a moment she stood looking down at him
with the softened anxious eyes. “Now you
lie there, an’ I’ll bring up your tea, and”—
She stooped swiftly and kissed him. In
the warm mist of his amazement he heard
the soft shutting of the door. He closed
his eyes and cuddled down into the sheets,
tasting again the bittersweet of the little,
leaf. “It worked,” he chuckled happily tc
the pillow. “It worked.”

[FOR THE BULLTIN.]
SWINGING through the headlands,
Lighthouse on our lee,
Home again, beloved,
Home again to thee,
To my old town calling,
Calling joyously.
Shipped with Captain Blackett,
Tramped her out and back;
Give the winch a trial,
And take in your slack!
Loose the for’ard gangway,
Slow your engines down.
Coming up the Harbor
To the dear old town.
Blue of Middle Harbor,
Sands of Watson’s Bay,
All the world a picture
Glowing in the day;
All the world a poem,
All the world a play!
See the ferries leaving
Wakes of greasy foam;
Tiles of shoreward suburbs,
All the signs of home.
Choking in the gullet,
Shameful tears will start —
Little birds are singing,
Singing in my heart.
Took our wool to London,
Turned her nose about;
Coming back with shoddy,
Gin and Irish stout —
Have your shorelines ready,
Get your fenders out!
Breath of many gardens
Coming faint and sweet;
Sound of noisy tramways,
Echoes of the street;
Spires and roofs remembered,
Crowded wharf and quay—
Oh, the old town calling,
Calling happily!
’Vast the winches heaving!
Let the gangways run!
Back again to greet you,
Daughter of the Sun,
With the last mile travelled
And the last task done.
VICTORIA.

[FOR THE BULLTIN.]
THIS is all about a destroyer, a naval
officer, a beautiful woman who was
a spy and other things that go to make
the war story. But as it happened in Hong
Kong and there was no war in Hong Kong
it can’t be a war story, so you are quite
safe in reading on.
The destroyer was old —very old. The
naval officer was young—very young. And
the maiden was beautiful —very beautiful.
Maiden is only a figure of speech ; she had
lived for some years in the East, where she
had plied an ancient trade to enable her
to keep the wolf from the door and the dogs
out of the garden.
The old 30-knotter Infamous, with a young
RN.R. two-striper in command, was ordered
by the C. in C. China Station to proceed
to the nor’ard, intercept a merchant ship
outside the three-mile limit, and tranship
a dangerous female spy therefrom, to be
landed forthwith at Hong Kong by the said
destroyer.
The R.N.R. officer was greatly bucked at
this chance to distinguish himself in the
Great War, and to get some relief from the
insufferable burden of patrolling off Hong
Kong harbor. His numerous affairs as an
officer in a passenger steamer eminently
fitted him for the job, he thought.
After three days’ plugging to the nor’ard
against the prevailing monsoon and the
aftermath of a young typhoon which had
just blown itself out, he reached his ren-
dezvous and anchored in the lee of an
island to await the arrival of the mer-
chantman and its fair freight.
All the best heroes have names,
and the name of ours was Horace.
He sat in his tiny cabin, in his
india-rubber bath, preparing his
plan of action and removing the
stains of three days of the intense
discomfort experienced in a de-
stroyer in really bad weather. In
spite of all his faults Horace was
a sailorman, and he had handled
his little craft skilfully. Most of
his crew had been seasick, and he
had himself supervised the “tom-
ing” up of the frames in the crew’s
quarters when they were buckling
like the ribs of a concertina and
letting in the Pacific Ocean in foun-
tains here and there. He had
assisted in rescuing the men’s ditty
boxes and bags, which were float-
ing around their mess-deck, and
had, in fact, behaved as the best
heroes should in trying circumstances.
* * * *
In a seaport in North China a sampan
struggled against the tide. The frenzied
efforts of the rowers —father, mother, son
and daughter—were redoubled by the flow
of filthy epithetic Chinese- issuing from the
rosebud mouth of a dainty little, woman
sitting on a pile of suitcases and clad in
garments that might easily have come from
Paris. The toothless old grandmother in
the sternsheets mumbled words of encour-
agement as she squatted beside the family
pig. Such undue haste meant increased
kumshaw. The four-year-old daughter of
the sampan, with the latest proof of her
parents’ prolificacy strapped firmly to her
back, gazed with browm, open-eyed amaze-
ment at the lovely, foreign devil, while she
stretched out her little arms to protect the
frightened fowls and ducks cluttered about
her feet.
The overladen sampan reached the gang-
way of the Chinese-owned steamer Chang
Le» just as the last sling of cargo was being
rattled inboard by the wheezy old winches.
Even the hard-bitten China-coast ship-
officers languidly leaning over the rail were
stirred into something resembling activity
as the vision in white mounted the accom-
modation ladder. The third mate saw her
first, and his face lit up as he rushed to the
side to assist her over the rail. Such slen-
der grace, such appealing eyes, such an air
of innocence had never gladdened his eyes
since he had left his home in Australia.
The full breasts and well-turned ankles in-
creased his interest.
She was visibly perturbed. Tears were
not far from her eyes, and a slight sob in
her voice as she asked if the ship was going
to Singapore filled the youngster with pity
for her evident distress. Calling a “boy”
to carry her luggage, he conducted her aft
to the old-fashioned saloon, and begged her
to partake of a cocktail while the domestics
were arranging her cabin.
Such good use did the youth make of his
time that before the damsel had left him
he had arranged to visit her cabin to see
she was well tucked in when he came off
watch that night.
At dinner the captain sadly neglected the
bespectacled slie-missionary sitting on his
right, and paid much attention to her vis-d-
-vis—the shy little lady who had managed
to catch the ship at the last moment.
So attentive were the ship’s officers to
the attractive lady that the purser quite
forgot to ask for her passport, and after
dinner Madame Clare heaved a sigh of relief
as she thought how the susceptibility of sea-
farers had helped her departure from a port
where her activities were becoming too well
known for her to stay much longer.
Three days of fine weather gave oppor-
tunities for long talks in deck chairs under
awnings. Every afternoon the infatuated
“third” sat gazing into those eyes of blue
that had seen more sin and degradation than
an up-to-date society novelist can tell us
about in twelve chapters and a prologue.
And at midnight he tiptoed to her cabin,
dodging domestics and trembling in antici-
pation of the joys to come.
What happened in that cabin I do not
know. All I know is that by the fourth day
the boy was so infatuated that he was pre-
pared to risk anything to help her.
On this fourth day a' radiogram reached
the ship telling the master that he must
meet H.M.S. Infamous in lat. 23deg. 16min.
N. and long. 117 deg. 20min. E., where he
would hand over to her commanding officer a
female spy known as Clare Kernouski, at
present a passenger in the Chang Lee.
The wireless man, an impressionable,
curly-headed youth, had fallen under the
spell of Clare, too, and must needs warn
her of the fate in store for her.
On the night of the fourth day, at the
hour of midnight—the hour of the fly’s noc-
turnal visits to the parlor of the spider—.
Horace hailed the merchant vessel Chang
Lee and the preliminary details of the dis-
embarkation were arranged forthwith.
Horace, deeming it would be more dignified
to receive his guest on the quarter deck, sent
his gunner in the boat.
The gunner, a worthy warrant officer, had
been sampling, just to see that it was up
to standard, the rum supplied by his Majesty
for naval ratings. Being a married man,
and rum being his hobby, he did not take
much notice of his freight either as she
came down the accommodation ladder of
the Chang Lee or as she mounted the short
step to the quarter-deck of the Infamous.
Horace, being a gallant hero, had arranged
to place his cabin at the disposal of the pri-
soner. As he conducted her aft to the man-
hole door that led below, the indifferent light
prevented him from observing how beautiful
she was. However, he assured her that
everything possible had been done for
her comfort and safety, assisted her to step
on to the ladder leading to liis cabin, and
when her head dis-
appeared closed
the scuttle
hatch
and
HE WAS QUITE RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

stationed a sentry to keep watch over it.
go far all was well. He had done his
duty, and he walked for’ard to the bridge
very well satisfied with himself. Then it
was “Full speed ahead,” and the old 30-
knotter sped through the night bound for
Hong Kong.
Horace spent that night on the bridge,
1> U (; next morning before breakfast he decided
to visit his passenger. The sentry opened
the hatch for him, and, as he descended,
the sound of stertorous breathing came from
the bunk. This was not the greeting he
had anticipated, and the glamor surrounding
the adventure seemed to be fading somewhat
as he walked towards the bunk with more of
the air of a military captor than he had
thought necessary to assume the night before.
He pulled back the curtain and beheld,
not the fair vision that he expected, but the
face of his own brother, the third officer
of the Chang Lee.
Horace gazed in amazement at the Hushed
face with its slightly open mouth revealing
a row of uneven, tobacco-stained teeth. The
feminine garments in which the recumbent

form was clad made the masculine face look
more out of place than ever.
Horace was annoyed. His romantic
adventure was becoming a tragedy, and tra-
gedies do not aj>peal to the youth of the
Mercantile Marine. He shook the hairy
arm that peeped out from the flimsy drap-
eries, and in an exasperated voice exclaimed:
“Good God, man! What the devil are you
doing here?”
The bleary eyes opened, and a husky voice
ejaculated, “Did she get away?”
“She be damned!” said Horace. “How
did you get here?” For this younger brother,
who he thought was in a cargo steamer on
the Australian coast, to crop up here was
most disconcerting.
The youngster, thoroughly awake now, sat
up in the bunk. Passing his hand through
his tousled hair, he began, in a hysterical
roice, to explain
things in dis-
connected
senten-
ces.
“Horace, old man, thank God it is you—
I had to do it —she was hounded to death,
and I had to help her. My God, you don’t
know how I love that woman—she is the
most wonderful thing that has ever come
into my life.”
“Oh, is she?” interrupted Horace. “Well,
shell damn soon get out of it. I’ll send the
Chang Lee a wireless and have her arrested.”
“Too late, old chap. I lowered her into a
sampan from the other side of the deck
while you were talking to the Old Man,
and by this time she is swallowed up in
the wilds of China,” answered his brother.
Horace cursed, but in spite of his exas-
peration came memories of a blue-eyed little
boy in a sailor suit clinging to the arm of
his adored elder brother and gazing in ad-
miration at his brass-buttoned uniform—
the uniform that had probably made the
tiny atom resolve that he too would one
day be an officer in a liner.
Poor little motherless kid, living in a
boarding-house with a careless, sex-obsessed
father, he had grown up neglected and ill
fed, his mental growth stunted. Then four
years in forecastles had produced the type
so easily seduced from the path of duty
by the first fascinating harpy who had found
it worth her while to tempt him!
But thoughts of his own ruined career
crowded out Horace’s memories of the blue-
eyed urchin. His brain Avorked quickly.
_ At. about four bells in the middle watch
his little craft would be passing close to a
point of land well to the nor’ard of Mers
Bay and just beyond British territory. If
only he could get this unfortunate brother of
his ashore there he could report 'the suicide
of the woman and escape with a reprimand
for his carelessness.
Unstrapping his wrist-watch lie handed it
to his brother and, in his best quarter-deck
manner, gave his orders.
“To-morrow morning at two fifteen we will
be close to land. I’ll send the sentry away
at that time exactly. You get up on deck,
make a d'ash for the rail, jump over the
side and swim for your life. God only knows
whether you will reach the beach, but it is
your only chance, so don’t hesitate; get
right over and swim like hell. If you get
ashore make your way back somehow to
the part of the coast where I was anchored
waiting for the Chang Bee, and you are
then the third mate who fell overboard
last night. If you meet that devil who
made you do this fool’s trick, cut her
throat. Good-bye.”
Horace spent a miserable day on
the bridge of his little craft trying
to banish thoughts of the brother
whom lie scarcely knew, years of
separation having made him almost
a stranger. He gave orders that
no one was to have access to the
after-cabin. All meals were to be
lowered to the prisoner below and
no one was to speak to her.
Shortly after four bells was
struck in the middle watch he
walked aft and sent the sentry off.
It was blowing half a gale and
a big lumpy sea was running. The
dead-reckoning 'was a little bit out,
and the Infamous was not quite
as close to the point of land on
her lee bow as her commander had
expected her to be. But everything
had been arranged and he could not
alter liis plans now.
At two fifteen precisely, Horace, stand-
ing well for’ard to prevent any unlikely in-
truders from wandering aft, saw the sckittle
hatch of his cabin open and a woebegone
face appear. The form of a slender youth in
feminine cami-knickers emerged and then dis-
appeared with a flying leap into a white-
topped wave that almost engulfed the little
craft.
With a sick feeling Horace groped his
Avay back to the bridge, knowing well that
the strongest swimmer would have little
chance of reaching the shore on such a night
and in such a sea.
* * * *
The war i s long over, and Horace is
captain of a fine passenger liner. As he
sits at the head of his table entertaining
the wives, of people of importance travelling
in his ship, his attention often wanders as
he gazes out through the portholes. He is
sometimes chaffed about “the far-away look
of the sailorman.” But, if they only' knew,
all that he can see is a blue-eyed urchin
clad in a pair of ladies’ knickers droAvning
in a raging sea.

The Bottle for the Track.
WHEN the cheque is nearly finished and
the jag is almost done,
When the time is fast approaching to start
paying for your fun,
When the publican has altered from the chap
he used to be,
When there’s no more “Drink ye up, boys!”
or “Ye’re havin’ this with me,”
Then you’re wondering how he’ll take it —
will he knock a fellow back? —
When you go and put it on him for a bottle
for the track.
When your company’s not wanted, and your
jokes have lost their punch,
When the barmaid’s smile has vanished, and
there’s no more counter-lunch ;
When you feel an interloper, you who were
an honored guest,
Then to-morrow, or the next day, when you
put him to the test
Will he part up free and easy? Will he
moan that trade is slack
When a fellow puts it on him for a bottle
for the track?
In the happy days behind you, when the jag
was in its prime,
You could solve the hardest problem to be
found in any clime;
In your more expansive moments, with your
fancy running free.
On all lands, and on all ages, you were an
authority.
But a fellow’s thoughts are narrowed when
he’s nearing his last zack,
And he’s worried by the problem of the
bottle for the track.
There’s a long road through the mulga that
will soon be yours to take;
There’s another job to look for and another
cheque to make.
And you know- —too well you know it —you
wlio’ve tramped it in the past,
That the road is hard and thirsty ’tween
the next cheque and the last;
And you’re wondering how lie’ll take it —
will he knock a fellow back? —
When a fellow puts it on him for a bottle
for the track.
WESTRALIA.

We're in the pickshers.
ē
ning and two wicked-looking Mausers
gleamed in his hands. George gasped, and
I nearly fell over backwards. The stranger
gave a little bow and took off his helmet.
His hair was jet-black and glossy as the
skin of a fat, wet seal. ‘He caressed it ten-
derly with a long, white, slim-fingered hand.
A subtle fragrance drifted towards us.
“My God!” choked George, unspeakably
shocked. “He uses hair oil!”
Within me a dim recollection stirred. It
was vaguely familiar, that superb, broad-
shouldered, slim-hipped figure, that still,
mask-like face with its faintly ironic smile,
those smouldering. .. .
A sudden memory flooded my brain. I
was “down south,” in a stuffy cinema theatre,
with the girl of the moment. The air was
thick with the odor of peanuts, oranges,
chocolates, heat-exhausted humanity. I was
dog-tired, thirsty, irritable. Definitely, des-
perately I wanted to go home. Figures flick-
ered on the screen —a man and a girl. The
man was a Mexican bandit, a cattle rustler,
an Arab sheik or, perhaps, a knight of
romance. He was holding the girl in close
embrace. His eyes devoured her. The girl
drooped like a flower; his arms tightened
convulsively about her. She lifted her beau-
tiful glycerine-tear-brimmed eyes to his.
They kissed. The audience sat tense, open-
mouthed, enchanted. A hot, sticky little
hand gripped mine. A breathless little voice
cooed in my ear: “Oh, darling! Isn’t he
simply, perfectly gorgeous!”
I recognised him now, the splendid youth
with the knives and the artillery; the haunt-
ing smile and greasy hair.
“Well, I’ll be damned !” I declared. “That

bird, George, is Desmond Dare, the film’s
Most Splendid Lover!”
“Is he?” responded George nastily. In
his voice was the concentrated distaste of
a continent’s masculinity. “Let’s knock the
gentleman.” The word George used was
not “gentleman.”
Then George breathed sibilantly. He stif-
fened. A leg of slim shapeliness, sheathed
in gleaming silk, reached out for the run-
ning board. A girl stepped out on to the
road- —a straight, slender girl, supple, free-
moving ; short-skirted, modishly shingled;
the kind of girl one associates with magazine
covers and brands of expensive chocolates.
George was suddenly alert.
A third man, a dried-up, skimpy little
fellow, whose jaws worked unceasingly, ap-
peared from behind the car. He carried
an outsize in cameras which he proceeded
to set up in the middle of the track. He
cocked an interrogative eyebrow at the fat
man, and squirted tobacco juice into the
dust. The fat man nodded.
“Hold her, Sim,” lie said briskly. “Shoot!”
We heard a faint clicking, George but-
toned up his shirt, and Lanabada village,
the rolling hills, the shimmering translucent
harbor, the now nervously excited villagers
and the Papuan Civil Service —at work—
were preserved for all time in celluloid.
The fat man produced a cigar with a
flamboyant band, and thrust it into his
mouth. As he waddled towards us his hands
played with the butts of liis weapons, and
his watchful eyes never left the village bucks
who hemmed us in. The cigar was twisting
and jerking between his lips, north, south,
east and west, in a manner wonderful to
behold. Then something went wrong. The
cigar slipped. It fell into the dust.
George snickered.
The fat man eyed George with cold dis-
taste. “Say, big boy,” he opened. “Can
the ‘ha-ha,’ and can it quick.” He scowled
fiercely at George. “I guess you think it’s
doggone funny when a guy loses a three-
dahler seegar. Huh! D’yuh know who I
am, fella ?”
“Betcha,” George said from the corner of
his mouth. Well read George is; a linguist,
moreover. “You’re a red-blooded, two-
fisted, hairy-chested, straight-shootin’ he-
man.”
The fat man blinked suspiciously. George’s
face was devoid of guile, and his eyes were
full of earnestness.
“Yuh cert’n’ly said somepin’ then, fella,”
the fat man began doubtfully. “Say”
“Also,” continued George, the unabashed,
“you’re a hootin’, sliootin’, scootin’, rootin’
son-of-a-gun from Tex”
“Shake, buddy,” the other cut in. He
stuck out a flabby hand. George shook,
and from that moment our relations were
established on a friendly footing.
“We gotta get together,” he told us. “We
gotta know one another. I’m gonna help
you boys, and you’re gonna help me.” He
distributed ciglars. “You’re gonna make
money—reel money, buddies. Fifty smack-
ers apiece, mebbe more. Think of it! Fifty
iron men—U.S. dahlers. Iluh-huh !”
We learned that he was Gustavus F.
Pfeiffer, of Sooperlative Fillums, Inc.; that
we were permitted to call him Gus; and
that he was personally con-ducting Desmond
Dare, the Soopreme Artist of the Century,
to 10-cations for a poignant, pashnate, soul-
stirring, eight-reel drammer of Love and
Hate and Revenge entitled “Cyclone Jack,
the Scourge of the Southern Seas.”
We were tremendously impressed.
The natives began to crowd us in on all
sides. The raw reek of their perspiring,
oil-anointed bodies was pungent in our nos-
trils. Mr. Pfeiffer was the centre of interest.
They fingered his guns and accoutrements
and volubly expressed their astonishment.
We heard the word “pikiser” [picture]
many times. Gradually they became restive,
excited. They jostled Mr. Pfeiffer rudely,
slapping their naked thighs and uttering
fearful yells.
Mr. Pfeiffer was plainly uneasy. The
World’s Lover unostentatiously climbed back
into the car. The girl’s smile was faintly
malicious, and Sim transferred his camera
to the driver’s seat. Mr. Pfeiffer coughed.
He looked appealingly at me and then at
George.
“Cannibals?” he whispered hoarsely.
‘These fellers cannibals, huh?”
“111 tell the world,” George assured
him with huge cheerfulness. It was not
for us to tell him that if he shook an um-
brella at the Lanabada lads they would pro-
bably have him bound over to keep the
peace.
The din became deafening; the reek of
unwashed native became insupportable. Mr.
Pfeiffer’s rifle clattered to the ground.
“Say,” he began, “I gotta get outa”
“Vaedaeni [finish] !” George bellowed.
“Hunt ’em away, Frypan.”
The clicking camera, the boisterous
natives, the awe-inspiring strangers and a
misguided sense of self-importance were too
much for Constable Frypan’s simple soul.
He lost his head completely. His bayonet
flashed and clicked into its socket, and with
an expression truly vindictive, head down,
carbine up, he charged into the crowd at
the double. A pandemonium of shrieks,
groans and stamping feet broke out. The
villagers scattered right and left, whooping,
howling and falling over one another m
their frantic efforts to §scape.
George acted quickly and with decision.
He hurled a cocoanut husk at Frypan. It
took him neatly under the ear, and his price-
less performance came to an end.
Mr. Pfeiffer’s strained face underwent a
magic metamorphosis. The instincts of the
showman triumphed.
“Oh, boy,” lie burbled ecstatically, his
paunch quivering, “ain’t that the luck!
The gcnoowine, raw-red stuff, or yuh c n
knock me for a sucker.” His voice became
sonorous. “The Black Heart of Unknown
Noo Guinea... .grim and murderous sav-
ages. .. .man-eaters, head-hunters. .. .red-
rimmed eyes, bloodshot, glinting. . . .stone
ovens dripping with the smoking blood of
the sacrifice”....
Feverishly he whipped out a monogram-
med notebook, shook out a gold-mounted
fountain pen, and recorded his big thoughts
with fingers that shook. The notebook
closed with a snap.
“Didyuh get that, Sim?” he yelled.
Sim took his foot off the self-starter and
shakily declared that lie had.
George writhed. Already he saw the flar-
ing headlines; already lie was fumbling in
his mind for phrases that would meet the
blistering “Please explain” with which some
unhumorous mandarin at headquarters would
smite us later on.
Then the Flappers’ Idol extricated him-
self from the car. The fragrance of his
presence seemed to dissipate an atmosphere
heavy with the odor of rancid cocoanut oil.
He thumped George on the back a few times,
saying' “Howdy, oldtimer?” in a deep,
vibrant voice. I heard George assuring him
that he was pleased to meet him. Then
1, too, held the right hand of the fragrant
youth while with his loft he pawed me with
great heartiness. There was an expression
that was akin to reverence on Mr. Pfeiffer’s
fat face.
“That boy sure has the goods,” he de-
clared.
George arose with almost indecent alac-
rity when the girl strolled over.
“Meet Laurene Lovelace, fellerte,” Mr.
Pfeiffer said, but without enthusiasm, I
thought. No star of the filmy firmament
this, I judged. Merely a “fill-up,” a foil
to the lad with the smellful hair. Never-
theless, she was a very dainty, trim little
lady. Pier eyes were limpid pools of loveli-
ness, her mouth a red, curving challenge,
her smile a dazzling provocation.
George stared enraptured. “Oh, you kid!”
he grinned feebly.
Instantly the smile froze on her face.
George’s jaw sagged. He had the appear-
ance of a small boy who has been treacher-
ously kicked in the rear. His distress was
pitiable.
“I beg your pardon?” she said icily.
George flushed as deeply as his hard, sun-
burned face would permit. He gaped a
little, swallowed hard, and wet his lips.
George .of the ready tongue was suddenly
dumb.
The girl’s mouth drooped at one corner,
and she broke into a gurgling laugh. “Have
a heart, laddie!” she murmured. “I’m from
Manly.”
Mr. Pfeiffer and Sim were in earnest col-
loquy round the re-erected camera. George
and the girl drew a little apart. They seemed
to have much to say to each other. The
Adonis of the Films was going through an
amazing sleight-of-hand performance with
various weapons of offence. Suddenly I
became aware that he was making faces at
me. His eyes scorned me, mocked me,
abhorred, withered and blasted me. Then
they were sad, wistful, full of yearning,
infinite pathos, fervent rapture. Then he
twisted his facial muscles into horrible
grimaces, bland smiles, fatuous grins and
stupid smirks. There were hearty laughs,
jeering guffaws, fiendish chuckles and girl-
ish giggles. I felt reasonably and justifiably
annoyed. Protests formed in my mind when
it dawned upon me that he was practising
the “registration” of those remarkable emo-
tions peculiar to the silver screen.
I turned to George for relief. If ever
a face registered “Buzz off” George’s did
then. Apollo had ceased demonstrating his
mastery of the monkey’s art of mimicry.
He came closer, leaned over me, and for a
panicky second I thought he was about to
kiss me.
“Your side-kick’s fell for the jane,” he
told me. “And one swell, snappy, li’l’ dame
she cert’n’ly is, I’ll tell the world. But
I meanta say she ain’t got no symp’thy ’n’
pers’nality ’n’ magn’tism ’n’ all.” He eyed
George morosely. “She’s cert’n’ly spillin’
a nifty line of blah-blah on that ham, all
right, all right.” His voice grew confiden-
tial. “Mindya, I ain’t knockin’ mv li’l’
gur] friend. No, sir! But I meanta say
I been watchin’ her, and she cert’n’ly struts
a snappy line of stuff all right; but I meanta
say it’s cheap stuff; any good-lookin’ skirt
c’n do that kinda stuff. Now, I gotta nifty
line”
“C’mon, girlie.” Mr. Pfeiffer’s confer-
ence with the camera man had ended. “Can
the soft stuff, and snap to it. Here’s where
yuh start pullin’ down yuh fifty berries
per.”
From then on Mr. Pfeiffer took charge
and events moved rapidly. George’s blas-
phemous protests were muffled in a ragged
black beard. He was, it appeared, Ilellfire
Charlie and all that the name implied. I
was merely a gin-soaked British official,
an infamous fellow, addicted to cocaine, mis-
cegenation and pearl-poaching. Apparently
I required neither disguise nor make-up.
Between us we were pullin’ sumpun rough
over Cyclone Jack’s baby doll with tire
object of sewing that doughty gentleman up
in a bag. Constable Frypan, the tempestu-
ous hero’s faithful black henchman, was
to spill the beans. There was to be a

rough-house—George’s eyes gleamed nastily
at that —heaving bodies, writhing limbs,
straining muscles, gun-play; red-blooded, he-
man stuff of the wide open spaces. Virtue
wmuld triumph; Vice would hide its dimin-
ished head, and the tail of the British Lion
would be incontinently twisted. There was
to be a close-up that would be the cat’s whis-
kers. With tears of ecstasy filming his
eyes, Mr. Pfeiffer assured us that it would
be a wow.
I protested with bitter-tongued vehem-
ence. George was but a feeble seconder.
Obviously he cherished a hope of giving Mr.
Pfeiffer’s scenario an unexpected twist. Pry-
pan was strutting hither and yon, throw-
ing out his chest, flourishing his bayonet,
but keeping a watchful eye upon George.
The stage was set. I was loathing Mr.
Pfeiffer personally and intensely. He blared
something through a megaphone, and that
damnable camera began to click.
Then the lid blew off.
A mob of armed and painted natives
dashed from the palm grove uttering blood-
curdling yells. They brandished fearsome
black palm spears, murderous pineapple-
shaped stone clubs adorned with feathers,
cassowary daggers and yard-long scrub-knives.
They beat upon lizard-skin drums, blew upon
conch shells, and howled with fury.
Mr. Pfeiffer seemed to buckle at the knees.
Swiftly and silently Mr. Dare effaced him-
self behind the swelling butt of a cocoa-
palm. The girl uttered a frightened little
cry and flew to George’s protecting arms.
On rushed the painted savages like fiends
loosed from the Pit. The drums throbbed
with a menacing note, spears clashed, conch
shells blared, all Hell had broken loose.
Sim was already in the car. Already the
engine was roaring. The stampede was on.
The Supreme Artist of the Century yielded
to an atavistic instinct to climb a cocoa-
palm ; evolution beat him, and he streaked
for the car.
George swears that Mr. Pfeiffer was first
aboard, but I was better able to judge.
Dashing Desmond won by a short head.
“ ’S’all right!” George bellowed, passing
a proprietax-y arm round the trembling girl.
“Keep your wool on. These lads only want
to act in your blasted picture!”
He might have saved his breath. The
flivver was a cloud of yellow dust on the
skyline.
We pacified the disappointed warriors of
Lanabada with soothing words and sticks
of trade tobacco. I recognised Sisivara
through his disguise of paint and grease and
feathers, and re-opened my register.
“Sisivara,” I said sternly, “if you really
are the father of all those piccaninnies your
missus has eight bob coming to her.”
I stole a sidelong glance at George. I
blushed. George was doing close-up stuff,
and doing it very well indeed. George also
comes from Manly.
G. M. TURNBULL.
The Elephant.
[FOR THE BULLTIN.]
NOT in the memory of the oldest inhabi-
tant had there been rain such as that
which had fallen for a week on
Mohana. It had poured down without ceas-
ing. Mostly it was without wind, but every
now and then gusts whirled in amongst it,
strong gusts that drove even the weight of
that thickness of water before them, making
it smash against the sides of Mohana’s
weatherboard houses, hurling it on to the
corrugated-iron roofs till all in those few
hundred homes had to speak at the top of
their voices to be heard.
On this last day there had been occasional
brief lulls, and then another sound of water
broke over the town. It was the river surg-
ing, rolling past, its swirling expanse clut-
INSIDE INFORMATION.
BOSS: “But do you know anything about our business?”
APPLICANT: “Too right I do—I’m engaged to your typiste!”
tered with fallen timber, maize, pumpkins
and small islands of green hyacinth brought
in to swell the flood by a hundred creeks
upstream. Its sound was heavy, a bass
booming on one overpowering note, monoto-
nous, loud, without any modulations. Never
had there been a flood like it. Always they
had prided themselves that no matter what
the farmers up and down the river or the
other towns along its length might suffer,
here in Mohana was security. It was as
safe here as it was on the high island right
in midstream opposite the town—the five
acres of island, with its bulwark of scrub
trees and bungalows around the upstream
end, and the narrow neck and green plot at
the other, with the clean white broken pillar
of marble almost at the extreme point. The
flood could surge past mainland and island
as it would ; both were high, safe and secure.
The rain had ceased now. A strange,
almost a wild calm had settled over the town,
With the dusk the clouds had vanished and
left the sky as clean as if it had actually
been washed as the earth had been. A clean
full moon filled the arch with its light, and
the silver glistened on the wet roofs and
the shuddering volume of water, whose sound
now rolled out heavier, more overpowering.
People came from the houses and picked their
way over sodden pavements and streets to
stand on the river bank and watch the
flood. They were proud of their firm banks,
still half a dozen feet above the water, and
when, going back to their homes an hour or
two later, they sympathised one to another
with those up and down the river who must
be suffering sadly, they did so with feelings
of self-satisfaction and contentment. There
had been misgivings, for there had never been
such a deluge nor such a flood before; but
that was all over now; in a few days the
river would be down, and such business as
was done in Mohana would go on as usual.
When the post-office clock of which
Mohana was modestly proud chimed out a
wheezy eleven strokes, only one citizen re-
mained on the bank. He stood out clearly in
the moonlight, straight and big-shouldered,
though even in that softening light he looked
old, and the silver that glittered on his bare
head was not all of the
moon. He stood there
staring directly across
the flood to the green end
of the island, where the
shaft of marble stood up
like a ghost. It was not
far, a little more than
four hundred yards, and
the swelling of the water
and the moving debris
seemed to halve- the dis-
tance. Quite alone he
stood there, deserted by
everybody, until the clock
struck twelve; then he
turned and went in
through his gate a couple
of .rods back from the
bank.
Inside he switched on
the electric light that
Mohana was only just
beginning to get used to.
On a small table exactly
in the centre of the room
a yellow bowl drooped
under a few withering
chrysanthemums. T li e
blinds on the two windows were drawn. A
black bookcase stood stiffly against one wall,
many of its books askew, and the tattered
backs of one or two of them accentuating
the general suggestion of dust and neglect.
Clearly no woman had been in the room for
a very long time. It was old, seedy, going to
decay, as he was himself. He still stood
straight and his shoulders were wide and
strong-looking; but under the white light
his face was aged and beginning to break
up, and as he sat in the one easy-chair in the
room he creaked a little and took care to
let himself down gently. Seated there his
eyes set directly at the top of the mantel-
piece above the fireless grate. At each end
was a small oval-shaped photograph, the one
of a woman, the other of a youth in uniform.
Both were dead. Midway between them stood
a small black, elephant, with inch-long tusks
and a genial expression. It was on this
oddity that his gaze fixed.
He had had it from his boy Jim when
that poor wreck of the war returned to
Mohana, a healed bluish spot on his right
breast and his forehead as strangely white
as the marble pillar that now stood over him
on the island. Jim had merely said: “Funny
little cove, isn’t he? I got him at Colombo
on the way across an’ was going to send him
back to you, but I hung on to him as a sort
of mascot.”
He had known well enough that Jim had
been wounded pretty badly, but it was just
then, when Jim was handing him the
elephant, that he first noticed the hard glit-
tering in the boy’s eyes that frightened him.
For a week after that he had watched the
boy closely till he was sure of that glitter-
ing; then, with a queer fear clutching at his
heart, he set at his son to have the truth
from him.
“This won’t do at all, old chap,” he had
said. “I suppose you don’t want to talk
about it any more than you can help,
But”——
“Yes, I know what you mean. Dad. It’s
pretty hard on you,” Jim had said, “but
Well, you see, Dad, they reckon I’ve got
my issue.”
“Who?” he had asked without meaning,
“The quacks. London and here.”
I't had been in this room, and they had stood
silent side by side for a tremendous few
seconds. The coldness that had clutched at
his heart had seemed to clench into a hard
lump then, so that he could do nothing but
grip his son’s upper arm and squeeze it.
The doctors had been right, of course, as
they almost always are when the talk is
vital. Jim died within the year; and
Mohana, rather proud of the first returned
soldier to die among them, had given him
that plot on the island, and, when they
decided to pay tribute to their other soldiers
later on, had put the broken pillar over the
grave.
The elephant, the genial expression on its
face defying the dust that settled in the room,
had stood in the centre of the mantelpiece
ever since; three rather hollow years. Jim
had not referred to it again; but Fellows,
■who, with Dubois, had gone off to the war
with Jim, had. told him a good deal about the
elephant one night when he came in, too
obviously from a reunion.
“Jim,” he had confided thickly, “used to use
THE ACID TEST.
“What do you think of my new costume?”
“Ripping! It makes me feel twenty years younger.”
the little cow as a mascot. Cripes,” he had
said, “I’ve seen him haul that little cove
out when I was holdin’ three sluts or a flam-
in’ Nelson on the roof, an’ stand it in front
of him on the blanket an’ bet me up to the
skies, an’ come to light with four of the
brightest.”
Fellows had told him of other occasions,
too, aw T ay from the poker schools, when the
elephant had proved its mettle as a mascot.
“You ask Duby,” he had said. “Come
down to liis boat an’ ask him now. He’ll
tell you. lie knows Jim had that same little
coot in his pocket when lie went out on
the ridge and pulled Duby out of the half a
pillbox that was smashed oil top of him.”
Quite a lot more Fellows had told him
that night and at other times about the
elephant, and Dubois, who now ran the
cream-launch ten miles up the river and
back every day, had volunteered a word or
two himself. Not lately, though. Nobody
had spoken to him about Jim, not even Fel-
lows, for a long time. Mohana, and the
once-again civilianised Fellows and Dubois
with it, had decided that “old Webster had
cracked up altogether over his son who came
back and died.” The implication of “cracked
up” touched chiefly upon the head ; old Web-
ster, they agreed, wandered a bit, didn’t seem
to listen to you when you were talking to
him. So they left him alone, as they had left
him a little while ago on the river bank, and
here, too, in the empty house, where he sat
perfectly still, his big hands on the cretonne
arms of the chair, his eyes fixed on the
genial-looking elephant.
The clang of one o’clock startled him. He
had dozed in the chair, and now he stood up
sharply and walked towards the mantelpiece.
He took up the elephant, which he had not
moved for three years, and was holding it
loosely in his hands when a strange new
sound broke in from the night above the
dull rumble of the flood. It was a crashing
sound, as if something had broken suddenly
out across the water.
lie hurried out, through the gate and over
the few rods to the bank. The crashing, less
loudly now 7 , was coming over from the island.
It baffled him, left him helpless, without
thought. Then, his eyes grown accustomed
to the change of light, he saw.
For seconds he stood there bewildered,
straining forward, watching. Then he turned
and ran along the bank upstream. His lum-
bering feet slushed in the sodden earth.
With difficulty he scrambled over a paling
fence that cut down to the water’s edge. His
heart thumped hard in his chest, harder
when he saw what his eyes were now strain-
- ing for—a light low down on the water. He
stumbled and half-slid down the embank-
ment on to the bow of the launch. There
was a sound of someone moving inside the
boat, and Dubois’s voice said, “Hey, who’s
that? What’s up? What the flaming hell do
you mean?”
“It’s me, Bill,” he said. His voice was
high-pitched, broken with his hard breathing.
“It’s me—Webster. The flood’s cut the
corner off the island. Didn’t you hear it?
Come on. Quick. I to go.”
“You what?” The voice was incredulous.
“I tell you I want to go to the island.
The flood’s cutting the boy off.”
“Look here, Mr. Webster. Look here. You
can’t go across there. You’d The boat’d
get tangled up in hyacinth. A log’d hit you.
Look at it!”
Webster looked, a swift, sharp, angry look.
He turned to the long, half-asleep half-
dressed young man in front of him, and his
voice rose loudly above the sound of the
flood.
“That boy saved your life. You’re like
the rest of the swine. You wouldn’t help
him. No, you wouldn’t help him. But I’m
going to take your boat. Get out of it! Get
out of it!”
The old voice, savage with rage, rose higher
and broke in a trembling cry.
But the younger man shook his head as
a horse shakes its mane and stepped back
farther on to hi s boat.
“For God’s sake, Mr. Webster, stop,” he
said. “I know all right what Jim did for
me. If you’re game, I’m not frightened.
Get hold of the wheel, Mr. Webster, an’
don’t say things like that.”
The old man did not answer. He moved
along to the bow of the boat, gripped the
wheel and stood straining out ahead to
where the end of the island loomed down-
stream. He stood there for five minutes
that could not be measured before the engine
fired, spluttered twice, and began to chug.
“Are you right? I’m letting go.”
He took no notice.
The launch started out, bumping over the
flood.
“Upstream. Steer hard up”
There was a heavy bump. The launch
staggered, bumped over something and
gathered speed. He stood gaunt at the wheel,
straining ahead, straining as he had strained
at the yacht tiller that lie had long for-
gotten.
The minutes passed without either of them
noticing. There was the moonlight on the
huddled debris and shuddering water, the
mumbling of the flood, the chugging of the
engine.
They were being carried down the river,
but they were getting closer, closer to the
island. It loomed nearer and nearer them,
black where the moon was not touching it.
After the long silence Dubois’s voice
sounded wild, something that did not belong
there.
“It’s broken through all right,” he cried.
“Through the neck.”
"Yes Bill.”
His voice was calm again, but he did not
turn his head.
And then, suddenly, the launch shot ahead
as if it were going from under them. It
swirled in the current that raced in at the
new-cut track. The wheel wrenched out of
his hands.
Half side-on, the boat crashed into the
channel. There was a noise of straining,
cracking timber, a clatter of falling glass.
The boat stopped, jambed there.
The two of them picked themselves up and
clambered to the side.
“Out, quick,” Dubois yelled. “We’ll be
under.”
But they did not go under. Nor did the
boat. It lay there, still, stuck fast in the
channel that was being eaten through the
neck of island.
They stood together on firm ground, an
odd-looking pair. In front of them the
white pillar stood firm on its small green plot,
silvered over now by the moon. They did
not speak; but the one who was silent from
sheer astonishment had a good idea of all the
other meant when his old hand gripped him
near the shoulder.
At last the younger spoke.
“The company,” he said, “will have to buy
a new boat if they want their cream run.
But, by God, Mr. Webster, it looks as if
she’s going to stop the flood biting any
further into the island.”
The old man did not speak. He was not
thinking of the launch blocking the channel;
his thought was that it was saving his boy.
Further, his right hand was at the moment
moving about in his coat pocket over the
smooth hunched back of an elephant.
In the morning, when the sun rose over
the flood, Mohana came down to its fine high
bank and looked and wondered. A little later,
after one of the fishing launches had brought
two fools and a report of the position back
from the island, Mohana agreed with Dubois
that the boat had certainly saved the Mohana
War Memorial. Nothing was said to old
Webster, who was allowed to go back to
his house, to the room where the mantel-
piece looked strangely bare without its
elephant. Curiously enough, for reasons
which it will profit nobody to try to analyse,
Webster had left the elephant buried beside
the marble pillar on the island.
Much, however, was said to 'Mr. William
Dubois, particularly by the Dairy Company.
“What,” its manager asked him —“what
do you think you could have done when you
got there, anyway?”
“Well,” said Dubois, “now you ask me.
I’m damned if I know.”

The Cruise of the
Greyhound.
[FOR THE BULLTIN.]
é
HE’D DO THE BEST HE COULD.
“Now, Henry, where have you been?—l want the truth.”
“Yesh, m’dear. Shtop me if you’ve heard thish one before.”
white dust. His defiant stare set me re-
calling faces. With a startling oath he
booted his swag across the track; then flop-
ping heavily on the log he entreated hoarsely:
“For Gawd’s sake, mate, don’t say you’re
out of tobacco!”
“What do you think I’rn smoking an
empty-pipe for?” I asked miserably.
“Hell an’ fury!” he moaned. “Stony
broke, tucker-bags busted, no smokes, ebrns
on me trilbies, an’ a thirst that’d swaller
a brewery. What a life !”
“I’m in the same boat. You’re not the
only fool carrying an empty head and a
fat swag.”
He thrust out a freckled paw and laughed
enthusiastically. “Shake, brother, shake!
We pair right here. My birth certificate
says ‘Scandalous Graham’.”
I “shook” cordially. Every shearing-shed
in N.S.W. knows “Scandalous.” “I’ve seen
you on Lightning Ridge.” I said. “But you’d
dodge the Devil himself in that layer of
Queensland dust.”
He thumped me delightedly and yelled,
“What! You from sunny Noo South, too?
That dear land where the old men never die
and the girls never grow old! We’re blood
brothers, lad. Innocents in a strange land.
We’ll boil the billy and make merry, for
to-morrow we pad th’ hoof.”
“Right-oh,” I agreed hopefully—“if you’ve
got the tea.”
His face fell. “I always forget th’ little
things,” he chirruped. “I’ll tel] you what.
You’re heading for Richmond, aren’t you?”
“Yes.”
“So’m I. We’ll park our curses here and
hop into Hughenden. If I meet any shearer
bloke, I’ll sting him hard. If not, I’ll
pirate a cook in one of the man-fleecing pubs,
or I’m not th’ sheik I was. That is,” he
compromised hastily, “if she’s not a ,Chow.”
“Great idea,” I said encouragingly. “But
the ladies don’t appreciate my personal ugli-
ness at all.”
“The conquest is mine,” he winked hid-
eously. “Th’ filly’s not been foaled that Scan-
dalous can’t rope in.”
I thought he was the ugliest man in
Queensland ; but I said nothing discouraging.
“Then,” he continued gaily, “we’ll blow
back here, feed up, an’ before dawn be sail-
ing down th’ Flinders first saloon for Rich-
mond.” He grinned hugely.
“I don’t get you.”
“Well, look here. Half a mile back there’s
a Chow’s humpy decoratin’ th’ river. He’s
got one of those sawn-off, red-iron tanks.
We’ll borrer th’ vessel, launch it, hop in
an’ th’ streamlet will waft us down to Rich-
mond. Like angels serenely floating down th’
stream of life!”
“H’m. But suppose it capsizes?”
“You can swim, can’t you?”
“Yes.”
“Good. I can’t. Now, look here. Would
you rather trudge the seventy blazing miles
to Richmond with empty tucker-bags, sore
feet, an’ th’ rags of your back flogging your
Sail-bone to a jelly in th’ breeze, or would
you sail down like a bloomin’ tourist?”
“The gentleman act for me,” I replied;
“yours are the brains.”
Scandalous grinned amiably. “Righto!
Here’s where we light out for the susten-
ance allowance. March on.”
j attempted to hide the swag. “Leave
th’ damn thing alone,” he roared. “If any
craw i e r pinches it, he’ll be tli’ fool.”
Glimpsing the sense in this, I hurried after
bim. “You see,” he said, “never pamper a
swag, or the habit grows on you. Likewise,
th’ swag. Th’ swag is th’ most parasitical
thing in this parasitical world. No skirt alive
can c ij n g to a man with th’ tenacity of a
swag’s embrace. You can generally shake a
skirt off by getting blind paralytic on pic-
ture nights; but th’ drunker you behave to a
swag, th’ more it clings. Mine has clung
so that it’s bored holes in my pink shoulder-
blades.
* * * *
I scouted hopefully on the town outskirts
while Scandalous whistled ahead on his for-
aging- Barely an hour later he returned,
his face wreathed in smiles, a bulging sugar-
bag over his shoulder. It held a cold
shoulder of mutton, two loaves of bread and
some tea and sugar.
“I told her she looked only twenty-five,”
ho grinned, “and had eyes like a gazelle I
knew in Egypt. She’d have given me half
th’ pub if th’ boss hadn’t been so dam’ sus-
picious. Her face reminded me of a barrel
of bone ash.”
“Blow her face,” I said eagerly; “let’s
hurry back and boil th’ billy. I’m famishing.”
“Here, hold hard ! We’ll light up, first.”
He halved a plug.
“You’re an angel, Scandalous,” I gasped
and meant it. “Where did you get that?”
“Pinched it from a drunk,” lie answered
simply. “His matches, too. Dear old mum
taught me never to do a thing by halves.”
That evening meal was a taste of Pleaven.
Lying stretched on the brown grass after-
ward, gazing dreamily up at the stars, the
soothing tobacco lulling me to sleep—it is a
memory of stolen content.
Scandalous booted me before daylight. A
billy steamed invitingly by the fire. Break-
fast was spread on the log.
“Hadn’t we better save the tucker until
to-night?” I suggested doubtfully; “there’s
just one decent meal left.”
“God feeds the sparrows,” replied Scan-
dalous cheerfully. “You sit there an’ watch
me eat.” He reached for the bread. I
reached for the mutton, lively. I'n ten
minutes even the crumbs were gone.
Half an hour later we stumbled over in-
terminable cabbage rows and located the
tank, full of water. Scandalous swore softly.
We vainly struggled to upend it; then we
turned the tap full and presently tilted it
over.
“Get a couple of saplings, quickly,” panted
Scandalous. “We’ll need ’em to pole her
off the mudbanks.”
I grabbed two handy sticks, then boarded
the craft or tried to. Scandalous’s clumsy
scrambling embedded the tub in the mud, and
I could not budge her.
Swearing fiercely, Scandalous tumbled out,
scraping a shin and the remnants of his
temper against the rough edges. We shoved
the obstinate thing into shallow water. I
clung to the wobbly brute while my bad-
tempered companion hastened aboard—with
a splash.
“Hell an’ slaughter-houses,’’ he yelled, “th’
blarsted thing’s sinking! She’s sprung a
leak. The swags are swimmin’.”
I laughed. “Why, we’ve left the tap turned
on.”
Scandalous flung muddy arms in the
air and kicked the water in the boat. “Then
turn it off!’ he roared. “AYe’ll have every
dam’ Chow in Hughenden tearin’ down here
in a minute!”
We worried the tub back to the bank, up-
ended her and pushed off again. She spun
giddily as I scrambled in.
“She’s a bit frisky,” observed Scandalous
amiably—“like all th’ uncertain’ sex.”
The roosters were crowing up at the
Chinaman’s. A fair current in mid-stream
speeded us up, at which Scandalous bawled
a triumphant cock-crow to the rising sun.
In boisterous answer the craft spun like a
lopsided top; then clumsily reversed. We
were travelling by degrees, but our direction
was the plaything of the current.
“You balance th’ starboard an’ I’ll balance
th’ port,” ordered Scandalous, “an’ see if
we can steady the Greyhound with th’ poles.”
We steadied her a bit, though mostly
starboard was the bows and port the
stern. She joggled along for an hour, and
we had just lit our pipes when an unforeseen
problem in navigation claimed our attention.
An overgrown gum had inconsiderately fallen
out towards the centre of the stream.
Now, there .was sufficient room for a
dreadnought to have passed, but the Grey-
hound made straight for the submerged tree
with a vim and sauciness that told of set
purpose. She hit it with a bang that boomed
a mile away. She sheered drunkenly off,
collected her wind, then “Bang!” again.
“Shove her off!” howled Scandalous;
“She’ll stave in an’ we’ll go to th’ bottom!”
“Ain’t I shoving her!” I yelled desperately.
“How d’ya expect me to shove her back
against this blarsted current?”
“Grab th’ branches an' pull her round Hell-
fire Corner.” (Bang, bang!)
I grabbed a branch and pulled. The tub
pulled too —backwards. Scandalous grabbed
my trousers just in time.
The Greyhound, spinning like a demented
catherine-wheel, hit the log a terrific smash.
As she shuddered on the recoil our heads
banged the iron sides. Picking himself up,
Scandalous screamed, “Quick, quick! Lean
our weight astern. If she only hits straight
th’ current will tilt her over !”
Luckily she did hit straight. The front
part, relieved of weight, nosed skywards like
a sick turtle. She slid on to the log and
for one terrible second paused astride it.
We sprang forward. So did the tank; and
if we had not violently back-somersaulted
it would have capsized right then. She spun
around until tired, then floated into a back-
wash and dreamily grounded.
While we were procuring fresh poles, the
ugly face of Scandalous beamed.
“I've fathered a brain-wave,” he said in his
bass voice—“a dinkum, corrugated brain-
tremor. See that leafy tree over there?”
“I saw it an hour ago.”
“Yes, and that’s about all you did see.
Now, swing your lustrous orbs on it an’
glimpse the rudder that’s going to steer the
Greyhound as straight as a parson’s con-
science ! We’ll trail a leafy bough, and you
see—she’ll waddle bows first then.”
We tried it. With the butt of the branch
as tiller-handle, jambed between a forked stick
lashed down one side of the tank, she steered
like a duck—lost a little in speed, but
became as steady as a derelict.
Thereafter the day slipped uneventfully by
into evening, then darkness. We went while
the going was good, for the sooner we sighted
Richmond the sooner we would dine. We
wanted to —now.
“Glimpse the sky ’way up river?” drawled
Scandalous.
“Urn. Those clouds are saying rain,” I
guessed.
“Never mind. We’ll tie the rudder loosely
and the current ought to keep the yacht in
its course automatically, so to speak. If it
doesn’t, we’ll only ground against a mudbank.
But we should ha’ painted the Greyhound
with a skull and crossbones.” And he hoarsely
bawled a pirates’ song. It was unprintable
and rendered with a roar that silenced every
mopoke for miles around.
“Fourteen men on the Dead Man’s chest,
Yo, ho ho and a bottle of rum!”
But presently even he lapsed into silence.
The stillness of everything was remarkable.
AND SO HE MISSED THE SUGAR.
“Brown was born with a silver spoon in his mouth.”
“Yes. But he never made much of a stir with it.”
Not a whisper from the passing trees, not
one chirruping cricket. Seldom have I known
a night so quiet.
i many Scandalous secured the rudder.
“It looks mighty threatening up-river, Jack,”
he said soberly; “still, I’m going to bye-bye.”
We huddled in opposite corners of the
tank. I was acutely hungry, but in a matter
of minutes Scandalous, his head sagging on
hairy arms looped _ across his knees, was
churning the tank into a hollow rumble of
snores. Presently I made a duet of it.
* * * *
That dream was awful. The liner was in
serious trouble. We might never reach New
York. The cabin was suffocatingly dark,
though the stars above twinkled like golden
pinheads. The frightening thing about the
storm was the absence of wflnd. No whist-
ling from tortured cordage, no wild gusts
shrieking along the silent decks.
But the water gurgled against the ship’s
iron sides, lashing the straining plates with
foam as it moaned past into the night. The
frightened crew were struggling with the
rudder as the ship was whirled around. It
could only be a matter of minutes, possibly
of seconds!
Frantically I pushed towards a porthole.
Then certainty of death overwhelmed me.
We were going to be rammed. _ A vessel
was bearing down upon us, an irresistible
thunder-bolt from the black night.
“Crash!” Flying legs and clawing arms;
ears thundering with the tank’s reverbera-
tions ; cold water pouring down my neck! I
sprang up and instinctively grasped the
slippery tree-branch that was grinding the
tank under.
“Push her off from til’ branches,” I cried.
“Quick! Shove —or we’ll be dragged under!”
It was an uprooted tree in the swirl of
a roaring tropical flood. Torrential rain
at the river-head had rushed an avalanche of
water down upon us.
Straining, panting, pushing, prodded by
sloppy boughs, faces and arms skinned from
the plunges of invisible branches, we suc-
ceeded at last in freeing the lopsided tank
from the heaviest limb.
“Hadn’t we better hang on?” yelled Scan-
dalous. “We’ll have something to cling to
if the tank goes under!”
“No, no! Push her right off! This cur-
rent will roll the tree over and over. For
the love of Mike, push her off.”
At our last gasp, with a scraping of un-
willing boughs, the big tree slipped by and
a second later was lost in the gloom.
“Find the billy and bale for all you're
worth—quick ! I’ll keep a lookout.”
But no eyes of man could have seen the
river banks that night, nor anything save
the stars above and the ghostly white of
hurrying foam. The air was one soft moan
of unseen waters. It took Scandalous only
five vigorous minutes to bale the tank.
“Thank God, she hasn’t sprung a leak.”
lie said soberly—“what price our chances?”
“Evens!”
“Anything you like —only don’t say your
smokes are wet, like mine!”
Feeling inside the flannel I drew a little
oilskin-enwrapped package.
Scandalous found his laugh again. Some-
how' everything seemed more cheerful with
the old pipes going; even the Greyhound
appeared to quieten down just a little,
though its spinning was still sickening.
The anxiously awaited dawn showed us
the river in rolling brown flood. We could
only hold tight and trust to luck.
Three hours later we sighted a tumble-
down shack, a Chinaman’s garden on the
outskirts of Richmond. Two yellow men
were standing by gazing at the river. Scan-
dalous waved a sodden blanket and shouted
lustily.
The men ran to a dinghy and with the
rushing current behind them, quickly inter-
cepted us and slung us a rope.
Then came the struggle. Those China-
men lost sweat. Scandalous was immensely
exhilarated by the unusual sight; but I was
scared that they might cut the rope and let
us go. However, they hung to the job and a
mile further down managed to tow us into a
by-wash.
Scandalous immediately stepped ashore,
his dirty face all smiles. I thought he was
going to smother the exhausted Chinese
with thanks. Instead, “Hi, John, I sellem
you nicee tankee. New feller. No leakee!”
he said.
“How muchee?” asked a Chinaman
laconically.
“A quid.”
The Chinamen bent to their oars.
“How much you give?” roared Scandalous.
“Ten sliillun.”
“All right, she’s yours. But you must
chuck in breakfast. We welly liungly.”
The Celestials debated a moment. “All li
—sposem you helpee rowmm hackee all li ”
“Right-oh, it’s a deal.”
So we toiled in place of the winded China-
men and battled back to the humpy We
landed the tank and these careful Chinamen
camouflaged her with a holey tarpaulin,
A little later, our insides warmly lined
w-ith curried rice, silver jingling in our pock-
ets and a cheerful whistle on the lips of
Scandalous, we trudged down the broad
browm road into Richmond,

The Plan.
e
JOE: “They tell me, Bill, that Eva’s father is anxious for you to marry his daughter.”
BILLL: “Yes, he reckons upon Eva’s mother coming to live with us.”
truth, his father died. He actually died of
a broken heart, though he was an unemo-
tional old Scot whom nobody would have
suspected of such an indiscretion; at least,
nobody but his equally old partner, James
Farquhar, who knew that the unexpected
failure, through unforeseen misfortunes that
struck the house of McNab and Farquhar,
as successive storm-waves strike a struggling
ship, had indeed sent Peter’s father to his
grave. His chiefest concern at the last had
been his young son, and James Farquhar, to
whom a few small private speculations had
ensured relief from penury, promised to
look after Peter. There were a few other
old friends who helped to provide a meagre
fund to equip Peter for the battle of exist-
ence, and Mr. and Mrs. McKinnon, who had
been befriended by Peter McNab, senior,
when they first arrived in Dunedin, took
young Peter home with them after the
funeral, and thenceforth centred all their
interests in him. The fund paid his board,
part of his father’s small insurance provided
for his education, James Farquhar took him
to his tailor’s twice a year and bought him
an outfit —he no longer wore kilts and tartan
stockings—and Miss Elspeth McDonald and
her sister Miss Alison, who had known
Peter’s mother as a girl, gave him each birth-
day a cheque for a guinea, which Peter
banked for a Purpose. Every Sunday after
church he went home to dinner with James
Farquhar, now very old and weary, who
lived with his elderly housekeeper in a grey
house set high on the hills that guard Dun-
edin. There Peter said grace in Gaelic, told
the old couple the news of the week, and
afterwards, when it was fine, walked up and
down the pine-walk with Mr. Farquhar, who
rested a frail hand on Peter’s shoulder and
told him that anyone could run crooked, but
it took a strong man to run straight.
Like the McKinnons, James Farquhar
found his chief interest in the small, solemn
boy with the round head and the searching
brown eyes who said so little and thought
so much, and who found evident satisfaction
in the company of a man of seventy who lived
in a lonely grey, house on a windy hill. He
regarded Peter's successive scholarships,
which began when he was twelve, as proof
of considerable brain-power, and rejoiced that
the last of the McNabs was growing into a
solid, stern-purposed young man ; and when
Peter was seventeen, and his last scholar-
ship nearly through, Farquhar made one of
his rare visits to the city, and sat for an hour
in the office of Duncan McNally. Peter
went into that office a week later, and
immediately began to lick stamps and add
up columns and address envelopes with the
whole-souled determination that character-
ised all his actions, and at tin; end of six
months was promoted to the position of
junior sliipping-clerk.
Thereafter Peter shipped benzine, kero-
sene, gasoline, naphthaline and turpentim
with equal assiduity, until the chief clerk
recommended him as a likely find for the
accountancy department. Peter tackled
double entry with undiminished enthusiasm,
and began a triumphant conquest of the
examinations of the accountancy association.
His salary was now £3 per week, and life
had for him a Definite Plan. Firstly, he
began to make Some return to all those who
had befriended him in his orphaned youth.
Thus Mrs. Hector Burns, at the Manse, was
compelled to keep her cottons in a workbox
lined with padded emerald satin, Peter’s
first gift to her. And Miss Elspeth and Miss
Alison, who would not have hurt Peter’s
feelings for worlds, always brought out, when
they invited him to tea, the violently-colored
picture of Ruth and Naomi which was
Peter’s first concrete appreciation of them.
In a like spirit James Farquhar wore a
greenstone pendant, and Mrs. McNeill, his
housekeeper, rested a slab of similar stone,
with “Mizpah” emblazoned on it, on her black
satin bosom. In addition Peter now paid
his board and bought his own clothes, was
the secretary of the Boys’ Sports Club and
the president of the Junior Anti-Swearing
League, and had paid a deposit on an allot-
ment ten miles from the city. He saw the
Plan spread serene and untroubled before
him.
When Peter was twenty-eight James Far-
quhar died and left him three thousand
pounds. It was quite unexpected—to Peter
—and the first thing he did was to make over
to Mrs. McKinnon, who had brought him up,
a third of the money, which Peter’s acquaint-
ances said was quixotic and unnecessary.
But Peter took no notice of criticisms. Gen-
erosity is sometimes not considered a trait
of the Scottish race, but Peter would have
told you firmly that in the True Scot there
is a sense of gratitude for kindnesses re-
ceived that begets it.
This was how matters stood on a bright,
frosty Dunedin morning when Duncan
McNally called Peter into his private office
and told him the firm proposed to transfer
him to its Sydney branch. Peter did not
hesitate. This was according to the Plan
He had arranged that at some not-distant
time he would go forth and see the world,
It was in the Sydney office of McNally’s
Ltd., that Peter met Reg. Reg was a reve
lation to Peter. He w T as three years Peter’s
junior, but his manner was that of a man
of the great metropolis, and from the first
he took Peter under his comprehensive wing,
Peter now lived at a boarding-house, The
Poplars, Hastings-street, where for the
moderate sum of £2 10s. per week one
obtained all the comforts of a refined home,
Judged on this standard, Peter’s previous
home had been of an untirely unrefined
variety; but Peter quickly realised that there
were differences between Dunedin and Syd-
ney, many apparent on first survey, while
others, which might be termed interior, made
themselves apparent on further acquaintance,
You 11 get used to us soon, laddie,” said
Reg, kindly when Peter remarked on sur-
face dissimilarities. "I must take you about
a bit. Do you bridge?”
“Yes.mdeed,’ said Peter; “I enjoy a good
rubber.
HOW MATTERS STAND.
“Had much to do with him?”
“Er—nothing to speak of.”
“And I know just the place where you can
get it,” said Reg. “You must dome with
me to Doris’s next Saturday night. She’s
crazy on bridge; and I don’t mind telling
you she’s some little player.”
“Thanks,” said Peter, “it’s awfully good
of you.”
“Not a bit,” said Reg. “She’ll be thrilled
to meet you. Better bring your cheque-
book. Some player, Doris.”
It was the morning after this conversation
that Peter first noticed the Green Girl. She
was standing at the gate of one of the few
private houses in Hastings-street, that
thoroughfare of flats and r.esidentials, when
Peter passed to catch his 8.40 tram. Two
fat, pinafored children were solemnly kissing
her, and with much backward waving she
tripped before Peter down the street. She
was small and slight and golden-haired, with
a pale skin and amber-colored eyes. Her
frock was green—-Peter afterwards described
it vaguely as a “sort of silk”—and her small
hat was what the social reporteress, when
suffering from a famine of descriptive phrase,
dismisses with a cautious “to tone.”
Peter was fascinated with her appear-
ance, her slimness, the flutter of her frock,
the sheen of her hair. He stepped into
the tram behind her, and presently had the
felicity of passing her tuppence and the
ticket, and receiving her thanks. There was
another bond between them when they
alighted at the same city stop, and their
return home by the same car emphasised the
similarity of their customs. Peter smiled
sympathetically as the fat children rushed
down the hill .and overwhelmed her, and the
Green Girl smiled back.
This was how Romance, that chancey jade
■who lurks in paths of unexpectedness, caught
Peter in Hastings-street, and every morning
induced him to wait behind the gate of The
Poplars until the Green Girl had farewelled
the fat children, and was ready to walk down
the street ahead of him.
“Bridge Saturday night.” Reg interrupted
his meditations. "No need to dress. We’ll
have a bite in town and go straight up to
Doris’s.”
Doris’s was at King’s Cross, up three
flights of stairs and round four turnings;
and after a noisy greeting by Doris, one
Pomeranian and a Sydney silky. Peter found
himself blinking unbelievingly at an enor-
mous white dog that looked like a young
calf strayed from its clover paddock. This,
Doris explained, was the Grand Duke
Michael, a Borzoi hound of ancient lineage
and incomputable monetary worth. He loved
bridge parties, continued Doris, short and
fat, with too-golden hair and small gleam-
ing blue eyes, and refused to stay in liis home
on the roof when one was in progress.
There were quite a number of people
present, not all intent on bridge, as Peter
realised when Norm and Myrt began sol-
emnly to dance to the strains of a raucous
gramophone, and Ive and Perce became
engrossed in making pancakes in the kitchen-
ette. The first rubber, in which Peter and
a melancholy young man named Wuzzy
played against Doris and Reg, was long and
tedious for Peter, who, playing in the unac-
customed atmosphere of much cigarette haze
blended with a stream of thin smoke from
the kitchenette, where Ive and Perce were
apparently having culinary difficulties, found
concentration impossible, and knew he was
not playing liis usual steady game. The
Grand Duke Michael insisted on lying under
the table and growled menacingly when
kicked, and just as the rubber was ending
Doris spoke affectionately to Pixy the Pom,
who, followed by Sambo the Silky, jumped
on to the table, scattering cards and ash-
trays in all directions.
Doris produced the only scorer from the
debris. “It’s all right,” she said—“the next
four tricks were mine. Now I’ll add up.
Be quiet, all of you.”
As in a dream Peter heard himself in-
formed that he had gone down seventeen hun
dred. Two of the last four tricks had cer-
tainly been his, but he had not the courage
to voice his distrust of his hostess’s calcu-
lations, and dazedly cut again. Myrt and
Norm still jazzed solemnly; Ive and Perce
had presumably eaten the pancakes and
fallen to a silence possihly induced by indi-
gestion ; a red-haired girl hailed as Thel
arrived without warning and asked if she
might use the machine, whereupon the whir
of her furious pedalling was added to the
general commotion.
The second rubber was ended by the sud-
den uprising of the Grand Duke Michael,
who balanced the card-table neatly on his
back and made, amid the screams of the
players, a dignified exit with it. Doris again
produced the scorer. “Five honors in my
own hand,” she announced. That settled
the matter for Peter. The ace had been his,
but as lie had last seen it on the Grand
Duke Michael’s tail he remained silent. Even
when Doris remarked that they always
“played a shilling” he remained unperturbed,
and did not mention that the usual Dunedin
game was a modest threepence.
The evening cost Peter nearly two pounds,
but he felt it was preventive experience
moderately bought.
“Party up at Myrt’s to-night,” Reg advised
a few days later. “Put on your dizzy best
and meet me at King’s Cross eight-thirty.”
Peter was now determined to see life, even
flat life in Darlinghurst. He was there punc-
tually, and waited uncomplainingly until Reg
appeared at nine o’clock. Myrt’s flat was
larger than Doris’s, up only two flights and
round only one turning, and the animal life
consisted of a Persian kitten and two can-
aries. Peter danced dutifully with a suc-
cession of girls, all very red-lipped and
bright-eyed and meagrely clad, who had shrill
voices and very agile feet and a predilection
for whiskies and cocktails. They were
entirely unlike the girls Peter had met in
Dunedin, and when one lady guest chal-
lenged the hostess to a duel, and they both
dashed into the next room and appeared in
bathing-suits, Peter felt that things had in-
deed changed for him. The Plan was going
wrong.
Next morning the Green Girl ran down
the street like a clean spring wind. Run-
ning behind her—they were both late this
morning—Peter discovered what he wanted.
Not jazz or cocktails or hilarious times in
crowded flats, but a little home somewhere
on a breezy hill with a rose garden in front.
Someone to wave him off in the morning and
open the door at night. He wanted to pat
the head of the next McNab (James Far-
quhar McNab, who would be followed at a
reasonable distance by Peter McKinnon
McNab) and take him to church on Sun-
days and teach him to say grace in Gaelic.
It was all written down in the Plan, which
for the moment had gone somehow astray.
True, his friendship with the Green Girl
progressed silently. Peter now raised his
hat when they met, and patted the fat child-
ren on the head with his paper in fatherly
fashion when he passed the gate of Cooee,
but he had not yet “met” the future Mrs.
McNab, nor even discovered her name.
Now that he had definitely discarded Reg’s
friends he felt rather lonely. “Have it your
own way, laddie. But you’ll miss a lot of
fun. Christmas coming along, and parties

at Cronulla and up the Mountains. Still,
if you won’t you won’t.” Quite kind was
Reg, but obviously disappointed that his
efforts to launch Peter into the society of
Bright Young People were not appreciated.
A few days before Christmas the Green
Girl (Peter had heard a woman in the
tram address her as Miss Wilton) acquired
a green parasol, a delightful parasol, from
which she was never afterwards, except in
actual rain, separated on the street. Peter
admired the trailing pattern as he hurried
for the tram on Christmas Eve, and noticed
its owner was a harmony in green except
for her black bag.
A great idea crept into Peter’s mind, and
that afternoon he took half an hour off and
sought a bag-shop. It was a beautiful and
shockingly expensive green bag he carried
out in its cardboard box, and an hour later
a special messenger was looking considerably
puzzled over an address, though the house and
street were also plainly indicated:—
To carry with
The Green Parasol.
Peter visioned a hundred times her delight
when she opened the box, and her wonder-
ment as to the donor. On Boxing Day he
saw her walking proudly out, parasol and
bag complete, and his state of mind became
ecstatic and his determination to live on a
breezy hill and pat the head of James Far-
quhar McNab more ingrained than ever.
“Sure you won’t come with us for New
Year?” asked Reg, the ever-hospitable. “Yon
should. No use mooning round in a board-
ing-house. Right-o, laddie. Don’t if you’d
rather not.”
Yes, he’d rather not, Peter told himself
as lie started out on a solitary walk on
-New Year’s morning, wondering how the
hills of Dunedin looked in the sunlight. He
would follow the Plan. A home, hard work,
an aim, a green and comfortable old age,
kindness to old friends. (Over in Dunedin
they were still talking of Peter’s bountiful
New Year gifts, which didn’t this time re-
quire to be kept in seclusion for msthetic
reasons.)
He walked briskly into the little park at
the end of Hastings-street, and turned down
the avenue of oleanders, white and pink and
apricot in their summer blossoming, his mind
full of the Green Girl. Then suddenly he
looked up and saw her.
She sat on a wooden bench under a spread-
ing fig-tree, a small suitcase on the grass
at her feet, the green bag on her arm, weep-
ing bitterly, and mopping her face with an
inadequate green handkerchief. Peter stood
and stared. She had not seen him, did not
see him until his hand was on her shoulder.
“Don’t cry,” said Peter. It sounded futile,
but as there seemed nothing else to say he
repeated it.
“Please go away,” said the Green Girl.
“Don’t bother about me. I shall be all right
presently.”
“I most certainly will not go,” said Peter,
gaining courage and a measure of knightly
protectiveness. “I can see you are unhappy.
I’m not a stranger to you. You know me by
sight.”
“Yes,” said the girl. “You talk to my little
cousins. It’s because of them I’ve left home.”
“Left altogether?”
“Oh yes. I’ll never go back. Uncle is my
guardian, but both he and Auntie are very
hard to live with. I smacked the children
for breaking my parasol, and we had an
awful row.”
“And what will you do?” asked Peter,
hopefully. She had wiped her eyes, and
was looking pathetically into the distance.
“Oh, I don’t know. Stay with a friend
for a few days. I don’t know what I’ll
do after that.”
“I do,” said Peter boldly. “You’ll marry
me!”
Now Peter expected the Green Girl to be
surprised at this, but he did not expect her
to be quite as astonished as she was. She
gave him one startled look, seized the suit-
THE AFTERMATH.
THE BETTER-HALF: “Fancy, John, it’s just twelve years ago to-day since my poor dear
Archibald, was killed in the fighting on the Somme.”
THE LESSER FRACTION (her second ): “What a curse war is!”
case and fled. Peter ran, too, chasing her
as she ran between the thickly-growing
bushes. She ran like a dryad, green dress
fluttering, little brown heels flickering like
two wind-harried autumn leaves.
And then Peter flopped into the arms of a
policeman.
“Steady, now,” said the policeman.
“Let me go!” shouted Peter. “Don’t stop
me!”
“Who’s that girl?” demanded the police-
man.
“I don’t know her name,” began Peter,
“But I want to marry her. I must catch
ber!”
“No, you don’t,” said the policeman firmly.
“Not in this town you don’t go chasing young
women about parks just because you’ve
taken a fancy to them. What’s your name?”
“There she is!” shouted Peter, and dashed
away. The fluttering green dress had van-
ished round a big hydrangea bush.
The next moment Peter stumbled over
the suitcase. It lay on the ground, its con-
tents scattered in all directions, and the
Green Girl was hurriedly pushing the things
back into it. Peter knelt down and began
to help with the packing.
“Keep quiet,” he said, “keep quiet!
There’s a policeman looking for us. I
meant what I said —
really I did. I’ve been in
love with you for
months.”
“Don’t be silly,” said
the girl in a muffled voice.
“I don’t even know your
name.” She was collect-
ing wisps of mauve and
blue and stuffing them in
the case.
“Peter McNab, of Dun-
pdin. Will you”
“There’s Uncle,” said
the girl suddenly. “He’s
come to look for me. I’m
not going back.” She
dived into the shelter of
a bush. Peter followed,
but Uncle had seen them.
A short, chubby little
man, he arrived panting
with effort and indigna-
tion.
“What’s this nonsense,
Jean?” he demanded.
“Come home at once. Who
is this young many?”
“I,” said Peter with the
air of one who would
stand no nonsense either,
“am your niece’s future
h u sband, My name
“I don’t care a damn
what your name is,” in-
terrupted Uncle. “Don’t
talk rubbish to me. She’s
not twenty-one till March,
and until then she’s going
to do as I tell her.”
“You have no right,”
began Peter; but Uncle,
a man of resolution evidently, seized
Jean by the arm and walked her briskly
up the path. He did not even carry the
suitcase, which confirmed Peter’s suspicion
of Uncle’s faith in his own superiority. And
neither of them looked back.
Peter felt that his holiday was completely
ruined. The Plan had gone hopelessly agley.
He had no heart to listen to Reg next
morning—Reg with his flippancy, for whom
everything seemed to go right, while Peter,
with his stern and noble Purpose, met with
nothing but reverses. Also, Jean had not
caught the tram as usual, so Peter imagined
her captive in the house of her unpleasant
uncle, whence it was clearly his duty to
rescue her.
It was from the fat children lie learned
there was no need for heroic measures, as
Cousin Jean had gone to the country for a
week.
The day she again ran for the tram Peter,
lurking as usuai, descended on her with a
whoop of joy.
“It’s no use,” she said, as they pattered
down the hill together. “And you mustn’t
worry me. Uncle will be furious if lie sees
me talking to you.”
“If only you would”
“Well, I won’t,” said the lady, and
boarded the tram.
Women were like that, Peter supposed.
Led you on and on and then turned round
on you. Still, he had not given up hope
yet.
Wandering in the lane that lay behind
The Poplars that evening Peter saw Jean
returning towards the back gate She
whisked inside as Peter approached, but
through a chink in the fence he saw her
waiting. He mounted a garbage-tin and
looked at her reproachfully.
“Jean,” he said, “how long is this to go
on? I ask you to marry me, and you won’t
even answer.”
Jean stood in the yard, the green bag
clasped to her, and looked at him, still with*
out replying. A fearful thought smote
Peter.
“Is there—is there anyone else?” he asked.
She nodded silently, standing there with
his green bag in her arms.
At that moment the lid of the garbage-
tin tilted, Peter slid to the ground, scatter-
ing tea-leaves and peelings over his boots,
a nail caught his trousers and ripped a
iTAT/.S S’ A. tm Si
man of resolution hit out silently and
landed what is known in certain circles as
a “dirty left” on Peter’s jaw.
Peter blinked dizzily; he heard Jean’s liur-
riedly retreating footsteps, and then Uncle
clicked the gate, and it was all over.
Blindly, with the tear on his knee flapping
dejectedly and his jaw swelling furiously,
NOW HE KNEW EVERYTHING.
CUSTOMER: “If that is a genuine Corot, I don’t know how you can sell it at the price!”
ISAAGSTEIN ( confidentially ): “My frent, I tell you—I vos new in dis pisness and I
bought too many of them.”
Peter strode in the direction of the park.
He felt in that hour that all women were
perfidious. Confound the Plan! It would
not keep straight. He had meant his wooing,
when the time came, to be leisurely, de-
lightful, dignified. This interviewing reluc-
tant young women from the sordid vantage
point of dustbin lids had never been anti-
cipated by him.
And, worst of all, lie had a rival.
Just then his progress was impeded by
the policeman.
“Hallo,” said the policeman. “You’re
the young feller that was chasing the girl.
Catch her?”
“No,” said Peter, “and I never will. She
has just told me she loves another.”
“That’s hot,” said the policeman, “after
you run after her so hard."
“Hot!” said Peter, “It’s !”
Peter! Which just shows how far lie
had travelled from Dunedin and the Junior
Anti-Swearing League. It is wonderful how
unrequited love enriches the profane voca-
bulary.
Peter looked half-
hopcfully at the police-
man. wondering if he
would arrest him, the
ex-president of the
League, for using lan-
guage in public. But
the man of the law
became reminiscent.
“Yes, they’re like
that,” he said. “Speci-
ially before you get
’em. When I was
keepin’ company with
my missus”
But Peter had
passed on. He had a
rival. That thought
beat into his brain.
The house on the
windy hill, James Far-
quhar McNab, the
roses and the garden
were not for him.
Well, he would find
out who the other man
was and have a word
with him, and if he
didn’t treat Jean well
and make her happy
he’d have him, Peter
McNab, to reckon with. And he, Peter
McNab, would henceforth devote himself to
Work. He would probably take up politics
and become a force in the country. They
wanted good, earnest men. He had done
with women.
But not quite. When the 21st March,
which he knew was Jean’s birthday, arrived,
he ordered the special messenger again. His
gift was a beautiful green scarf and a
bunch of amazing pink roses. No word of
greeting with them —just the address.
He seldom saw Jean now, as he walked
to work by a tramless route. He could not
bear to look upon his rival’s betrothed. But
he still cherished a desire to look upon the
rival.
Pursuant to his plan of inspecting the
rival, Peter kept a close watch on the house
next door but one. It might even be said
vulgarly that he snooped. Thus after six
nights’ vigilance he was rewarded by seeing
a tall young man walk briskly up the back
lane and fumble with the latch of Cooee.
Peter walked unhesitatingly and purpose-
fully up to' him.
“One moment,” he said, “I want to have
a word with you. It’s just this. If you don’t
treat that girl as you should I shall have
something to say about it.”
“Treat who?” said the young man.
“Jean Mis s Wilton When you marry
ffer.”

So that was that. He managed, this time
to avoid Uncle, who was searching for a
tost kitten up the lane, and went home
feeling rather at a loose end. Next day he
borrowed a dozen Hansards and began to
study the political situation seriously. He
was through with women.
Again, not quite. Two evenings later he
met _ Jean once more in the lane. She
carried a violin —presumably, thought Peter
bitterly, taking lessons to brighten up the
evenings with his rival in their future home.
He raised his hat and passed her silently,
even though the green scarf —his gift—did
look wonderful against her pale skin.
“Peter,” she called.
Peter paused. He was not one to force
himself where he was not wanted. Jean
came up to him.
“Peter,” she said, “I want to tell you
something. Come over by the fence. Although
I’m twenty-one Uncle is still very bossy.
You know, I told you, Peter, there was
somebody else, and I have been worried
about it. You see, Peter, I don’t know him.”
“Don’t know him?” Peter repeated,
stupidly.
Jean shook her head. “I don’t suppose I
ever shall. I only know lie is the best and
kindest man in the world. He sent me
this” —she held up the bag—“and this”—
she fingered the scarf —“and lovely flowers.
I feel somehow, Peter, that he —that I”
“That you love him,” said Peter, hoarsely.
He could have shouted for joy, but at that
moment the head of Uncle appeared round
the gatepost, waggling like that of a snake
on a reconnaisance. Peter drew Jean into
the shadow of the big fig-tree further up
the lane. Uncle looked up and down
cautiously and then retired to the yard,
where the . wireless man who was not a
rival was tinkering with the aerial.
“Take a look up the lane,” said Uncle,
“and see if that young feller is there with
Jean. Your eyes are better than mine.”
The wireless man strained his gaze into
the darkness. Some distance off he noticed
a black band on a white background.
“They seem to be all right,” he said. “Are
they engaged?”
“I hope so,” said Uncle, putting a couple
of screws into his mouth for safe keeping.
“I’ve made a few inquiries about him and
they say he’s got a bit of money. But I’m
not pretending I want him to marry her,
and more’n likely they’ll go off and get mar-
ried without letting us know. That’s my
Plan !”
“Too right,” said the wireless man, who
had caught a remark that floated dowm the
lane, and sounded to him like “Damn
Uncle!” (This was Peter, dizzy with the
success of his Plan.)
“And that,” continued Uncle with unc-
tion, “will cut out the expense of presents
and guests and rubbish. Gimme that
hammer.”
But there was one guest at the wedding.
Peter and Jean, wending their secret Tvay to
the church on Saturday afternoon, met the
policeman, who, strolling home to tea,
likewise encountered the bridal party. Peter
put the situation before him and invited
him to come into the church.
“Seeing as you’ve caught her at last,”
said the policeman, “I don’t mind if I do.”
Thus it was that when Reg condescend-
ingly turned to Peter, prepared at last to
listen indulgently to his week-end experi-
ences, and expecting the usual lack of ex-
citement in Peter’s narrative, the bomb was
hurled.
“I got married !” said Peter.

NO ALTERNATIVE.
“Smith’s pretty good as a golfer, isn’t he?”
“He has to be. He’s such a poor liar.”
people—a grey, indiscriminate mass,
Humanity rarely seemed more characterless
than upon that night. They seemed to glide
along with faces bent before the rain, notic-
ing nothing in the streets, much less the
menace from the city. Their footsteps tapped
or beat upon the hollow pavements which
ages since had covered the last blade of
grass. Each hurrying form was immersed in
its awn thoughts, each bent on picking its
way, in this rush hour, homewards through
the impeding traffic.
Over the city and its unconcern one man
was brooding, and his heart was full o" hate.
From his window he looked down upon the
huddling buildings surrendered to darkness,
and he plotted vengeance against the forces
that had made this hell, enticing with its
yellow lights. With chin in hand he medi-
tated on the plan which he had
already resolved to carry out.
Behind him his room lay in a
confusion of books and papers—
paper-backed, dilapidated books
and mangled manuscript upon
which lie had tried to compose
his thoughts. The titles leered up
at him mockingly—Karl Marx,
Louis Blanc, Bernard Shaw;
works on Socialism, Anarchism,
Communism; protests against
Capitalism; the books of de-
stroyers, of builders, of those
who would set the world aright.
They were worn with constant
fingering and reading, and now
the student of this literature
looked down upon the city and
the mankind they depicted.
Desmond considered himself a
thinker for other men, for those
unconsidering ones who could
never think for themselves, who
were now blindly stumbling
towards their homes. Did they
realise the menace of this mon-
ster city around them, which
held them poised upon its pro-
truding lips, ready to suck them
down into its maw? Did they
know how this city had been
conceived and brought into
being? Desmond knew that they
did not know. To them the
city had merely grown. Fools!
Fools! It was the capitalist
who had done it all; the capital-
ist who had built this sinister
mockery, who had strung the
beads of colored light that hid
the pit with their dazzle. Fools!
The streets were paved with
the bodies of men whose bones
were the foundation of this
towering structure.
Those were the thoughts he
was thinking for them —them,
the grey, indiscriminate, mass
that he would save. The
thoughts were not the product
of moments, or of hours, even
of months; they wore the accu-
mulated dust of years of poverty, and toil
and reading. At first lie had written them
for radical newspapers which paid lib rally
for fiery words; now he had come to believe
them himself. And belief was not pleasant,
although at moments it might bring a wild
exultation with its hopes of revenge.
Now that his plan was on the eve of
fruition he- drew back from it, not in definite
horror, but with- a vague recoil —a Hamlet-
like desire to think and think upon it, and
not to act. But he had sworn away all unre-
solve. To-night the city would have offered
at its altar it s own builder as a victim—a
blood-offering to the souls of all those other
men who were trampled beneath the pave-
ments which now resounded to the idle click
of high-heeled slippers.
The lights that blazoned many a name
before the stars showed one especially—
Montague. He was the master mind, the
master builder here, “A self-made man”
they said in wondering admiration. His
factories belched out smoke to the murky
skies, his factory fires employed millions of
sweating men. He was to be struck down,
Kings were to be pitied; they had been set
on their thrones, unwilling perhaps, by
the hand of heredity and fate; set above
friendship and the world, through no fault
of their own. But that a man should de-
liberately set himself out, without pity or
mercy, to gain these distant heights and
to gain them by condemning thousands to
sw T eat for him in the iron foundries was
criminal, dastardly.
Constant brooding had made Desmond as
cruel, as heartless and as firm as this lord
of the iron foundries. That man was to die.
Was to die that night, in the midst of the
TIIE POT AND THE KETTLE.
TRACKER: “Hello, Midnight!” ,
COMBO: “Y’ plurry smart bin call it me Midnight. Y’ plurry quarter to twelve yerself!”
unheeding traffic of the grey, unheeding
multitude he had helped to gather. In ven-
geance ! If one could avenge a million.
It was maniacal. Yet in this dim room
above the city, surrounded by the tombed
thoughts of dead men, it seemed to Desmond
rational and natural —the only way. Night
after night lie had watched the great limou-
sine with the drawn blinds glide through the
streets, to come to rest, as the cars of even
the mighty must, at the relentless crossings.
There, alone —always alone —the lord of
this region, this Montague, had to wait until
the congestion cleared. Desmond had
watched the little newspaper boy open the
door and thrust himself into the. green
gloom to hand to Montague the evening re-
cord of suicide and crime. But to-night—
Desmond handled a little thin-edged knife
from Persia curiously curved back at the
tip ! To-night would be an end.
A man should have a single purpose in
his life and no tangled threads; should be
prepared to die for his principles—to die
exulting that his work was done. Desmond
had to face this issue. Was he prepared
to do this? Until recently he was certain;
but now he tried to avoid the thought. It
was not necessary. In such a crowd a man
could slip away easily, never to be seen
again. The evening congestion at that
corner was great; no one would notice. The
great motor would glide on to the iron
gates of Montague’s home. His chauffeur
would open the door, slowly and deferenti-
ally, to behold his master gazing into no-
thing, with the little Persian knife stuck in
his heart. Desmond’s great theory was that
the multitude glided by unnoticing to their
homes. To-night they would pass unwittingly
the sacrifice offered in their midst.
But if, in spite of all, he was discovered—
what then? Although he was coolly con-
demning another man to eternity, he shrank
from it himself. Cowardice? Perhaps. Des-
mond admitted that much to himself. Life
w-as sweet, and far beyond were open spaces,
where the sun did not fall through dust and
cobwebs, where apple blossom showered its
spray and man might labor on the bosom of
the earth herself. He might go there —he
could go there with Lorna. But first this
deed to which he had sworn himself must
be done. He rose to go.
He pulled on a dark coat and muffler and
seized the fresh, crisp newspaper from the
corner. Under cover of this the knife was
to be proffered. He turned down the gas
of his dingy room and stepped out into the
corridor. A brisk broom was trying in vain
to rejuvenate the faded roses of a worn red
carpet. Two strong young arms, plump and
red, propelled the broom. A maze of curls
tumbled out from under the red handker-
chief tied upon her head. Two eyes looked
up at him through long lashes. “Oh Mr.
Desmond —John,” she said, “you must be
cold. Do let me fix your muffler.” Her
arms were around his neck. “Where are
you going?”
He looked away. Somehow he felt he
could not kiss her now. “Down to the city,”
he replied, his eyes upon her broom.
“Oh John, I wish you wouldn’t. You
know you hate it. It makes you sad. I
hate it. too.”
He looked down at her. “Lorna, would
you come away into the country, far from
this” —his hand swept the dingy walls—
“with me?”
Her pale face flushed; she pressed her
face against his muffler. “With you—yes, I
would, John. I’d work* so hard. There’d
be chickens nud eggs and flowers. Wouldn’t
there, John?”
She looked so like a flower herself stand-
ing there in the dingy passage that, despite
compunction, he stooped and kissed her. She
was made to make men sane. What if he
went now and left his horrid purpose
undone?”
She nestled closer. “I’m so tired,” she
murmured. “The factory—and the noise or
the machinery—they kill. My head is aching.
Desmond shook himself. Millions were
bowed beneath this load of tiredness. To-
night he would do his deed. She unwittingly
had resolved him. To-morrow —he could
think of a to-morrow. “To-morrow, Lorna
dear, we will go. The gorse will be in
flower.”
“To-morrow?” she murmured, suddenly
fearful. “There may never be a to-morrow.
There never is. Let’s go now. Let’s run
away. We must, John; I’ve got a horrid
feeling running up my spine. I’m fey.”
She tried to hold him, but he broke away.
“No, no! I’ve something I must do to-
night.” The clock struck six. “I must go,
or I’ll be late.” Suddenly he kissed her and,
bursting away, ran down the narrow stairs
into the winter’s night.
His head was bursting. Lorna —the coun-
try—sunlight! He must live.
❖ ❖ * *
Mr. Thomas Montague leaned back lazily
in the leather couch of the club lounge sip-
ping a creme de menthe. He jocularly
called it his nightcap, and he always drank
one before entering his car to be driven home.
Lovely color, ergme de menthe —what did it
make you think of? Dear me, the lights of
a chemist’s shop gleaming on a dark night!
He’d noticed them. He flattered himself he
was an observant man. Methodical, too.
He’d drunk the same drink and he’d passed
the same crossing at the same hour going
home for twenty years. And always had to
wait there, too —that was where he’d noticed
the green lights. A man had to look at
something when he was alone. And he was
always alone. Strange—he didn’t make
friends now.
He watched the club men pass. There
was Smithers, with that smile of his. Queer
fellow, Smithers; bit of a waster. Never
got on, very popular with everyone, even the
stewards. What would it be like to be
popular? he wondered. “Oh well”—he
braced himself —“I am a successful man.
Success breeds enemies; success has its
price.”
To-night they had been talking next to
him of the social discontent, the growth of
radicalism. Blackwood and Hall were there,
talking learnedly about it and the recent
strike. He had leaned over. “They’re
fools, those workmen; they can’t see their
own noses. A good Conservative Govern-
ment is their best friend.” They had looked
at him and been polite; but somehow the
conversation had lagged. Why was it?
The clock struck six. Time to go home.
The steward helped him into his ulster, and
he went down the broad stone steps of the
club. By the kerbstone, between the two
statues of Liberty holding the street lamp,
was the car; in the same place every night
for twenty years. He smiled rather sadly.
Jenkyns held open the door and he stepped
into the green gloom inside. In the silver
vase were’ Easter lilies. Horrid flowers!
They made you think of death and hearses.
He must tell Jenkyns not to put them there
again.
It was very lonely at the back of his car.
He seemed to feel it more intensely to-night
than ever before. A green blind separated
him from Jenkyns. Suppose he sat in the
front for once with his chauffeur. How the
man would stare! He had never done it
before; but what did it matter? He almost
rose to stop the car, but sat down again.
No, the master must maintain his dignity,
must keep himself aloof.
He raised the side blind a little. How
drab the city looked to-night! He remem-
bered when he had felt its cruelty and its
cold. Once he had sold newspapers on the
corner. Ha, ha ! No one would think it

PROSPERITY” is a common toast, and Aus-
tralian industry to an Australian is a synonym
for prosperity.
If a man is sincere, if he is really a loyal Australian,
he will honor such a toast in an Australian liquor.
Which means that the Australian whose chosen spirit
is whisky will call for “Old Court.
And why not? “Old Court” —the Australian whisky
—is the world’s purest. It is an aged-in-the-wood,
mellow spirit without superior in the world.
There is no sacrifice involved in drinking “Old Court”
Why not stick to it?

now. He had risen. A man has to be hard
to do that. He had made a comfortable
place for himself in the sun. The sun! He
had almost forgotten the sun.
The car came to a halt. That infernal
crossing again! The traffic always was
blocked there. Well, he was used to it now
after twenty years.
Upon some impulse he pulled up the blind
at the little window behind him. He looked
out. The people were scurrying by, looking
neither to left nor to right.
Something strange held his attention
THE PIONEERS.
ĕ
An excited crowd gathered.
“Give him air, you fools, give him air!”
“Air?” said an old man, raising his head.
“He don’t need air now.”
A little man on the outskirts of the crowd
shivered. It seemed scarcely decent, some-
how, death in the street.
The lorry-driver was wringing liis hands.
“I couldn’t stop. He got right in front of
me. He must have meant to die.”
A hand was laid on the shoulder of the
little man. He turned and saw a negro
staring at him with saucer-like eyes. It
gave him a horrid feeling, as if the man were
reading his soul. What with the accident
and this, it was a creepy night.
The negro was speaking: “Sail, what is
de matter? I want to cross de road. Will
you help me? I’m blind.”

w
far back into the heavens. Only the moon
rode near to earth and bright it was, lighting
all the dear familiar landmarks from hill
to hill.
I leaned to the window that I might see
farther along the hill-etched horizon, but
the pain caught me, my breath failed me
and I struggled back to my pillow.
Some moments passed. My brain cleared,
and I lay thinking. Then was my spirit
rebel in the fight that took place within me.
When, it cried, when will death come? Not
death to my flesh alone, but kindly, obliterat-
ing death, that will blot out all life within
me, blot out that keen
existence of hungers
and desires?
With jealousy of
the hidden meaning I
heard a sleepy tomtit
outside my windows
pecking and twitter-
ing with his mate.
But the sounds gradu-
ally subsided. A few
flutterings and an-
swering twit - twits
and silence fell again.
Over the ploughed
fields and hills and
the far-away sky the
quiet brooded.
I wondered if the
black-caps were back
this year. Last year
when 1 was about
they hung their cradle
nest high above my
window and Yo Ho
barked at them when-
ever he had nothing
else to do. But now
—perhaps they have
not come back. Why
should they when
there are so many
other places in all the
land?
Perhaps they are
there and Yo 110 has
forgotten—he has for-
gotten so many things.
But I have not for-
gotten ! A year ago l
to-night, with just
such a moon sailing
low', Captain Lee
Broughton, of the
Southern Maid, stood with me by the big
fallen log at the foot of the garden and
christened my shaggy-headed dog Yo Ho.
Much laughter did the ceremony cause, and
Yo Ho yapped joyously as we raced him to
the yard. But he did not yap so joyously
when we turned the tank water on to him
in the course of his christening. Even now
in his rambles he circles that tank. Only a
friendly hand can draw him near it. Little
dog, it was a silly prank, wasn’t it? But we
w T ere so happy that night, Yo Ho. You must
forgive us.
Some day Lee will come for you. Be good
to him, Yo Ho, for my sake. Remember he
was my friend and my lover. Remember
that it was I who sent him away. I told
him that when one lay so sick one could
not love.
My dear, oh my dear, I did not mean it;
but what was I to do? A strong man tied
FIRST THOUGHTS.
“What a lovely night!”
“Yes, isn’t it — let’s go to the pictures!”
to an ailing woman is a pitiful tragedy. And
so my seemingly mild acceptance of my fate
killed all hope in Lee. To myself I pictured
the years dragging out and Lee wasting them
by my bedside. Hope? There has never
been any hope. Strange that desire should
be so alive and hope so dead!
Had I known then that my life would be
but one short year more, I think I would
have clung to Lee. But I knew nothing
definite. His port of call is 200 miles from
here. His ship stays but three days each
trip. Who am I to demand his precious
hours on shore’ He came to me twice. I
can still see hi s face, eager, anxious. JLhe
hurt look in his eyes when I feigned dis-
interest—for his dear sake. I can still hear
Yo Ho. He barked one single yap up into
Lee’s face. Lee bent and spoke to him. I
did not hear what he said.
"Lee!”
“Yes.” He turned to me almost sharply.
It hurt.
“You will take Yo Ho —some day.”
“If he will come,” he replied dully, and
went out.
The hearts in all this world will under-
stand why I thought it best to pretend that
life and love were nothing to me, and, so
pretending, to send Lee away. So many
tangled reasons. Greatest of them all, be-
cause I love him so.
In the white moonlight we gathered an
armful of golden and scented wattle. The
soft little balls were white as snow in the
darkness. I hugged them to my breast and
their perfume was like wine to my heart,
intoxicating, lifting me beyond myself until
a wild song went racing through my veins.
Lee stood very close, not touching me.
His face was in the shadows, but I knew
his eyes would be tender for me, and blue
and deep. Could he hear the song in my
heart? Know the warm tingling because he
was near? Suddenly his voice came, low
and quick:
“Sweetheart! Beloved !”
My arms lost their power to hold; the
soft fragrant bundle broke and fell to the
ground. One little yellow spray was left
clinging to my shoulder. One small piece
of bloom, that we might remember always
our loving.
After a sweet silence Lee took that spray
of wattle and slipped it into his pocket.
I knew then what I know now, but how
could I tell him that our dream was born
but to die? To tell him would be to deny
us both one golden hour before he must be
gone to his ship.
What is life but a string of golden hours
—those we have known and those to come?
Some day when I am gone, my dear, remem-
ber the hour I gave to you—and took for
myself. Even in that hour, though silently
bidding you farewell, I was happy, glor-
iously happy. For it is not the parting that
hurts. There is a sacrificial glory and a song
that is born of the last hand-clasp, the last
tender, clinging embrace; and all that but
makes the moment sweet!
The pain lay for me in the cold to-morrow
pregnant with hopelessness and bitter despair.
All round me shone the bright world.
Duties and friends beckoned me to be on
with life —what was left of it.
For a week or two Yo Ho trotted often to
the road to watch for your coming over the
hill. I held his head tightly in my hands
once, letting the hot tears fall. He looked
up into my face very quietly and attentively
while I told him you had gone forever. But
he did not believe me, for shortly after I
saw him lifting his nose, like a dog does,
pointing up the road, where you had gone.
So the year has died!
This evening when they lit my lamp they
placed a bowl of golden-hued wattle by my
side. In the subdued light of the room the
yellow balls were white, and Lee’s card hung
from them where I could plainly see it.
The fragrance of his gift of remembrance
has sent a new thrill of strength through
me. I do not want to die! Yet these are
my last hours!
The same white moonlight on the hills as
shone a year ago to-night, the same sweet
scent upon the air; and to know he is the
same lover —there is hardness in that to
bear! To-night he holds me dear!....Oh
God, must I go?

JESSIE MACKAY.
It's 'Ard to Be Honest.
[FOR THE BULLTIN.]
WELL, what do you know about that?
Dick Wells and me is in the muck
again. It just shows yer. I been
in din’ sixteen years, an’ I been a straight-
goer an’ never put it acrost nobody, see?
An’ now me an’ Dick Wells an’ Mr. Land
sale has run into a nest of crooks what we
thought was honest men.
Well, listen. When Up-to-Snuff fell in
the City Cup Dick an’ me did our bit, and
Mr. Landsale, the owner, lost a poultice.
But Mr. Landsale’s a sport. He didn’t roust
or nothink. He said I wasn’t to worry.
He seen it all through ’is glasses, he said —•
saw me get up to ride ’im at the top of the
straight, an’ the ’orse, thinkin’ I was goin'
to pull ’is ’ead orf, stopped sudden an’ got
bowled over by the field. An’ he said the
’orse did that because I ’ad used my arms
at the top of the straight in the two races
before the Cup meeting, when we were run-
nin’ byes to make a market for Up-to-Snuff
in the Cup. He said it was just a nerror
of judgment on all our parts, an’ Dick
Wells, the trainer, said the same, see? That
shows yer what it is to ’ave always been a
straight-goer. You’re trusted by owners an’
trainers. Any of ’em will tell yer, if yer
ask ’em about me; they’ll tell yer that
little Tim Toon is a ’orseman what knows
what ’is ’ands is for—an’ ’is arms. An’
that Tim’ll place yer ’orse where yer want
’im at any part of the race—an’ at the finish.
An’ they’ll tell yer Tim Toon’s name’s a
byword on the turf an’ he keeps ’is month
shut.
I don’t wanter blow my bags out, because
it’s my old mother I gotter thank for lteepin’
me straight through all the crook stuff of
a rider’s career. “Ye’re enterin’ a perfes-
sion, Tim,” she said the day I ’ad me first
mount, “an’ I’m proud of yer,” she said.
“But perfessions is dangerous,” she said;
“so much money ; not like trades, where yer
can’t get yerself into no trouble. No,” she
said, “perfessions is different.” An’ then
she folded her arms an’ said, “Tim,” she
said, “yer won’t never do nothin’ that ain’t
absolootely straight; yer won’t never bring
your old mother’s grey ’airs in sorra to the
grave?” That’s what my old mother said
“ENGAGED.”
sixteen years ago, an’ it’ll just show yer
what a straight-goer I’ve been when I tell
yer my old mother is ’ale an’ ’arty to-day.
Listen. Mr. Landsale told Dick an’ me
to forget it. He said he would dig up some-
think that would bring back all we were
sliy. an’ a bit over. He said he was goin’
in for the race game big, like lie did as a
company promoter. He said the small stuff
was no good to ’im, an’ lie wanted to ’ave
about ’im only trus’worthy men with vision,
like me an’ Dick. Mr. Landsale claimed
he ’ad promoted more companies in Orstralia
in the last twenty years than any other
dozen men, an’ he said the way to make
this country grow was to promote plenty of
companies.
Well, look. Mr. Landsale came back from
New Zealand, where he’d gone for a trip,
tickled to death. He’d gone away down-
’earted because ’is big black ’orse Break-
neck was doin’ no good in ’is preparation for
the Grand National, an’ it didn’t look like
as if it was worth while startin’ ’im. It
was a bit of a smack in the eye. We was
all sorter dependin’ on Breakneck, for all
’is coffin ’ead, to come good an’ put us in
clover again.
Well, Mr. Landsale came straight from
the boat to Dick Wells’s stables, lookin'
fatter than ever, an’ all red an’ sweatin’,
an’ wearin’ the kind of face yer see once a
year on the owner bf the Melbourne Cup
winner. He takes Dick an’ me by the arms
an’ leads us to Breakneck’s
loose-box an’ closes the doors.
He runs ’is ’and over the ’orse’s
back an’ says, “Gentlemen’
(when he called us “gentlemen'’
we knew it was a good sign)
“Gentlemen,” he says, “it’s just
six weeks to the National, an’
unless I’m very much mistaken
ole coffin-’ead ’ere is goin’ to
win it.” An’ then lie drops ’is
voice very low, an’ puttin’ [is
arms round me an Dick lie whis-
pers, “Not ’isself, gentlemen—
no, not ’isself; but by proxy.
Yer don’t get me?” he says.
“Right. Listen.”
An’ then he tells us there’s a
’orse in New Zealand that’s the
best steeplechaser he ever seen
in ’is life. ’ls name is Man-o-
Money, an’ he belongs to two
Maori brothers named Toto,
wlio’ve been racin’ ’im in the
country. He says he saw ’im
win two steeples ’an he per-
formed like a cliampcen. Gal
loped like Gloamin’ and jumped
like a goat. An’ he said the
’orse ’ad never been properly
trained or schooled, an’ that
the half-caste what ’ad tin;
mount was a mug rider.
An’ tnen Mr. Landsale drops
’is voice further, an’ puts us a
full jerry as to what ’is big
idea is. He said he didn’t want
to make no mistakes by trustin’
only to ’is own judgment, so he
wanted me an’ Dick to take the
first boat for Auckland to ’ave
a screw at the ’orse, an’, if they’d let
us, to try ’im out with me ridin’ ’im, an’
then if we was of the same opinion as him-
self, to make a bid to get ’im. We was to
go as high as eight ’undred quid, which he’d
send acrost to an Auckland bank to Dick’s
credit. But he said he thought we’d get ’im
for a lot less, because them Maoris was
terrible simple an’ acted like kids. They’d
only been breedin’ an’ racin’ ’orses since they
come into money a few years ago, an’ they
didn’t use their ’eads for nothin’ else than
to grow ’air on an’ keep their ears apart.
An’ lie finished up by tellin’ us that we
’ad to be satisfied with the ’orse. We ’ad
to buy ’im right. An’ we 'ad to land ’im
in Dick’s stable in good health. An’ he
advised us to play our cards close* to our
waistcoats, an’ to show those Maoris the
cash. He’d found there was lots of tilings
that them Maoris couldn’t resist, an’ one
of ’em was cash.
“An’ now,” he says, pullin’ the loose-box
doors tighter an’ wipin’ the sweat off 'is
face, “if you fellas do your stuff, as I think
you will, we’ll all be on the pig's back
when Man-o-Money takes the name of Break-
neck in the Grand National, wearin’ a nice
black coat of the very best dye.” Then
Mr. Landsale went off in ‘is car, an’ Dick
an’ me went home to pack because the boat
for New Zealand was leaving next day.
Well, I don’t want to skite or nothin’,
hut I couldn’t help thinkin’ what a nice
thing it was that my sixteen years’ straight
gion’ as a norseman was reckernised by
such a fine gentleman an game sport as
Mr. Landsale. An’ that night my mother
said, “Tim, that’s what comes of always
dealin’ honest with your employers—they
respecks and trus’ yer more an more, an
yer respecks yerself.
Next day me an’ Dick sailed for Auck-
land, an’ Mr. Landsale saw us orf, an is
last words were> Breakneck 1S a hundred
to one. You cable me as soon as Man-o-
Money is on the ship an’ I’ll get busy with
the hooks.”
.Well, we arrived in Auckland a few days
after Man-o-Money ’ad won another country
steeplechase, so we lost no time in gettin’
out to see the Maori owners. They lived
about thirty miles from the city. The ’ouse
looked a bit rough, an’ so did the stables,
but the trainin’ track was a bonzer eight
furlongs, an’ they ’ad a flash motor-garrige
painted green an’ yellow, an’ inside we
saw a flasher car. Timi Toto an’ Henare
Toto was both big fat blokes an’ always
laughin’, an’ rollin’ their eyes. They was
terrible good-’earted, makin’ iis eat an’
drink all the time. Yer could see right
THE POT SUFFERED, TOO.
“It looked to me as if yer husband had something wrong with ’is eye this mornin’,
Mrs. ’Aggis.”
“Yes, blast ’im. I had ter send me saucepan away ter git it mended.”
away they was awful simple, like Mr. Land-
sale said.. Dick told ’em we was over on
a short ’oliday, an’ wouldn’t mind pickin’
up a nag or two if we struck somethin’
worth while an’ the price was right. They
told us they ’ad plenty money, an’ raced
at the country meetin’s for the sport of the
thing, an’ they didn’t perfess to know much
about ’orses an’ ’ow to train ’em. An’ they
said they’d sell us anythink we took a fancy
to exceptin’ Man-o-Money, the steeplechaser,
because they didn’t reckon we’d want to
pay as much as they wanted for ’im. An’
Dick said casual, “Wot are yer arskin’ for
’im?” An’ Timi Toto said, "You wait till
we show ’im to you,” an’ we all walked
over to ’is loose-box.
Well, strike me, I get the shock of
me life when we pipes orf Man-o-Money.
He was a big, ugly, rangy chestnut with
not a white mark on ’im anywhere. He
looked as if he’d been pullin’ a tramcar an’
a good sweat ’ad dried on ’im. I drums Dick,
“That ’orse ’as got to be some performer
to get over them looks.” But Dick just
gives a low whistle to ’isself. Then one
of the Maoris says, “What about ’avin’ a
ride on ’im?” an’ that’s just what we wanted.
Well, they gets ’im out later on, and 1
changes me tune as soon as he starts to
move. He was the springiest thing I ever
put a leg acrost, a natchrel galloper _ an’
a born jumper; an’, what’s more, he liked
it. Yer couldn’t give ’im enough of it. He
was a beaut. When I dismounts I gets
a word with Dick. “Go the limit,” I says;
and Dick says, “Good enough!” So we rugs
up the ’orse an’ goes over to the ’ouse.
The Maoris are laughin’ an’ talkin’ m
their funny way, like kids, and passin’
round the eats an’ drinks, an’ sudden-like
one asks Dick what he thought Man-o-
Money was worth. An’ Dick comes back
pat by throwin’ four hundred-pound notes
on the table, an’ says nothink, an’ for a
bit nobody says n»othink. Then Timi spreads
the notes out an’ counts ’em. Then Hen are
does the same. An’ that’s the only time
they don’t laugh, but talk to one another
in Maori, very excited like. An’ then Timi
laughs again an’ says, jokin’, “Man-o-Money
not always win; sometimes he lose. Man-0;
Money like tw.o ’orses —a winnin’ ’orse an’
a losin' ’orse. Mr. Wells,” he says, “you
must be tliinkin’ of that ’orse when he loses
to offer only four ’undred pounds for ’im.”
And then he turns to ’is brother, an’ for a
long time they talk in Maori very excited.
An’ when at the finish Timi Toto says to
us, “ ’Tain’t enough,” Dick gets up an’ picks
the money off the table, an’ is goin’ to put it
in ’is pocket, an’ the two Maoris stares at
’im, rollin’ their eyes somethin’ awful, an’
Timi says. “Hold on, ain’t yer goin’ to bid
any ’iglier?” an’ Dick laughs an’ I laughs
at the Maoris sliowin’ their ’ands that way,
and Dick says, “That’s the limit, I can’t go
another penny,” an’ is just goin’ to shove
the wad in ’is pocket when Timi gives a
laugh, grabs Dick’s wrist, an’ blurts, “All
right. If that your limit we take the money
an’ you take the ’orse.” So we all goes
to Auckland in the Rolls-Royce an’ fixes
everythink up before a lawyer, an’ we arrange
to take delivery of the ’orse on the day
before the boat sails, which is in a week’s
time.
Well, when the boat sailed me an’ Dick
an’ Man-o-Money was aboard all right, an’
we ’ad a slashin’ trip. The sea was calm
all the way, an’ the ’orse just ate an’ slept.
An’ when we landed the champeen chest-
nut at Dick’s stables, Mr. Landsale was all
cock-a-hoop, an’ kep’ on sayin’, “We’re on
the pig’s back, lads, an’ we’re goin’ to
stay there.” An’ he told us he ’ad backed
Breakneck to win ’im fifty thousand pounds
in the National, an’ he was now at tens, an’
the public couldn’t understand it. an’ the
bookmakers thought he was mad. He offered
me an’ Dick as much as we could afford to
take of ’is bets, so I took two ’undred quids
worth an’ Dick a lot more, an’ me motner
raisp d a mortgage on the ’ouse to bnd tlie
money. National
B was just three weeks f tW( j
an as Breakneck was accepted tor two
steeples before the big eve . , at '
three days after Man-o-Money arrived Mr
Landsale decided to punt th? chestnut tor
them races as well as the National an clean
up a bit more. So on the night betore tne
first race, Mr. Landsale an me an <
puts in some good work, an when we re
finished Man-o-Money looks so muen liKe
Breakneck we gotter keep em apart so s
we won’t make no mistakes. Before we lock
up for the night Mr. Landsale tells me an’
Dick that when the race is over the ’orse
must be brought to the stable right away,
and the dye washed off with the stuff he’d
got to do it with, because it didn’t do the
’orse no good to stay that way top long.
Well, I was never so puzzled in me life
as I was in that steeplechase. The ’orse
seemed to have no life at all. He just felt
between me knees like a ’orse what loses
races at a picnic meetin’. He couldn’t ’ave
beat the ’orse the clerk o’ the course was
ridin’. We is tailed orf all the way, an'
he rattles the timber at every jump. He puts
the wind up me. I expects to break me neck
every time he takes orf. At the finish I’m
all in, an’ I rides into the saddlin’ paddock
with my tail down. But Dick an’ Mr. Land-
sale wasn’t worryin’ at all. “He ’asn't got
over the sea trip,” Dick whispers. An’
Mr. Landsale says, “It’s just as well; ’is
price will lengthen again for the National.”
So we get back to the stables an’ set. to
work to turn ’im into a chestnut again;
an’ a long, ’ard job it was. But when he
was just about ’isself again, an’ Dick was
doin’ ’is face an’ Mr. Landsale ’is forelegs,
all of a sudden there’s a terrible roar from
Mr. Landsale, an’ then he lets go a string
of words I never ’card ’im use before. An'
when me an’ Dick goes to see what the
matter is, Mr. Landsale’s sittin’ in the
straw, under the ’orse’s ’ead, an’ he’s starin'
’ard at the ’orse’s forelegs. Then he tries
to talk an’ can’t, so he points at the ’orse’s
fetlocks, an’ looks up at me an’ Dick, an’ I
don’t wanter see no one look at me like that
again this side o’ the grave. An’ when I
looked at Man-o-Money’s forelegs they was
white, ab-so-blank-lootely white from the
’oofs to the knees. I goes sorter funny all
over, an’ I puts my ’and on Mr. Landsale’s
’ead to steady meself. An’ then Mr. Landsale
puts ’is ’ands to ’is face an’ rocks ’isself
to an’ fro, an’ moans like anythink. Then
he jumps up sudden, an’ looks as if he’s
goin’ to take to the pair of us. But he
just bursts out cryin’, an’ the tears what
lie knocks out with his fists splashes on to
my face. An’ then he bellows out, “You
poor suckers, look wot yer let the bleedin’
crooks do ter me!” An’ he goes on some-
think awful an’ shows us the chestnut dye
all messed up with the black dye that he
■washed orf the ’orse’s legs.
There was no doubt about it. Them Maori
crooks ’ad sold us a stiff, what they dyed
to look like Man-o-Money. That’ll show yer
what honest men are up against in my
game.
Well, listen. When we cleaned ’im up
proper I reckon I looked more like Man-o-
Money than he did.
Well, me an’ Dick is right in the muck,
an’ Mr. Landsale’s lost a terrible poultice,
an’ he scratches Breakneck for all engage-
ments, an’ goes to Auckland in a terrible
rage to ’ave a bit of them Maoris. But
he comes back all in. The Maoris put it
all over ’im, an’ we’re terrible sorry, me an’
Dick. The Maoris laughed at ’im an’ said.
“We tell your men, Mr. Wells an’ Mr.
Toon, that Man-o-Money two ’orses, the win;
nin’ one an’ the losin’ one. The winnin’
one’s price two thousand pounds, an’ the
losin’ one’s price four ’undred pounds, an
he worth it because he always make a good
market for ’is brother the winnin’ one.
You can’t get a winnin’ ’orse,” they says
“at a losin’ ’orse’s price; so what yon
growlin’ about?”
So Mr. Landsale come back an’ he says
“Them Maoris is absolutely impossible for
a honest man to deal with.” An’ he say-
lie’s gotter get out of the game for a bit.
He says he’s goin’ ter promote another
company, an’ he’s goin’ ter promote it in
New Zealand.

Lost-an Empire!

stress of his thoughts, till it gleamed dead-
white. That evening as they had cast anchor
the rays of the setting sun, slanting along the
face of the mountains, had gleamed red on
something tapering, solid, flat-topped—like
one of those vast pyramidal temples which
the Mexicans called teocallis. True, Father
Gomara had thought this only the red scar of
a landslip in the mountains, but Father
Gomara was a sour-spleened shred of a man,
without any of the appetite for converts
proper to a friar. And now, in this moment,
it seemed to him that the very voice of this
land of mystery was calling to him, calling
him to great adventures, crowned with golden
riches, royal favor. Was not this a rich and
fertile land with its nodding palms and grey
immensity of forest stretching away to
mountains whose tops were tufted with trees
that were of a greatness beyond belief had
they not seen them with their own eyes?
A goodly setting for a great empire this, a
very different land from the barren wastes
and fever-haunted mangrove swamps they
had seen earlier in the voyage, in spite of
the Franciscan’s plaint that “there had been
inhabitants in those parts and here there
were none.” It was true they had seen no
savages—unless those strangely bounding
specks to the south had been Indians —but
they had stood so far off-shore during tin;
day that it was probable that their approach
had passed unobserved, and when they had
drawn in-shore the sun had set and darkness
fallen almost before the anchor had touched
bottom.
A falling star flashed across the sky and
seemed to plunge into the midst of the dream
mountains. Della Torre crossed himself. At
that exact spot, to the left of the high dome.
YOU NEVER CAN TELL.
“I never worry about my husband paying
attention to other women — he’s crazy about me.”
“But, my dear, he may have lucid intervals.”
where he had observed the teocalli....
Heaven added its portents to those of earth ;
to the fateful anniversary that fell toi-
morrow; to Marina’s dream. The Cross and
the Sword, or the Scourge of Abasement —
which had it been? —blazing out of the night
sky over that city of Eldorado, where the
Indians ballasted their canoes with gold and
the palace walls were studded with jewels.
It was said these Mexican women had power
by dreams and portents to foretell the future
—truly Mother Church forbade such belief,
but might not ages of heathenish intercourse
with Satan and the bloody devils that were
their gods—might not these have given them
diabolical powers from whose knowledge (St.
James be praised!) Christians were pre-
served ?
Nay, he wronged his pious Marina. Rather
was hers a holy vision from the Virgin,
or St. James his blessed patron—such a
vision Father Gomara said was vouchsafed
only to the pure in heart. Had she not
embraced the pure Faith with all the warmth
of her fiery soul? Who but she rebuked him
for devotions neglected in the turmoil of com-
mand? Marina! Marina! Strange, beauti-
ful woman ! From the day that he had taken
her at the siege of Itzapan his fortunes had
soared. Like a solitary star over an unknown
sea, she had warned, guided. But was she
wholly, utterly his? A coldness latterly—
something withheld. A long time, two years
—two years his. Itzapan had fallen on the
seventeenth of March. To-morrow the tenth
0" March —aye, to-morrow was the tenth of
March. Twenty-three years ago on that day
Cortez had landed on the shores of Mexico;
within two years he was master of the cities
and treasure of the Aztec empire. To-morrow
he, Della Torre, landed on the shores of a
great continent. He! And who could
tell
“Your Excellency!” The voice floated up
bodiless from the black waist of the ship.
Who knew that great cities did not
lie hidden in that sea of forest, peopled by
heathen dogs waiting to be overthrown by
the favor of St. James and a stout Castilian
arm? Rich in gold and silver. .. . Some said
it w T as in this region, lay the land of the
anthropophagi, of the men whose heads grew
beneath their shoulders, where the sands of
the rivers were gold-dust. According to that
excellent cartographer Sarmiento de Saave-
dra. this land was 500 leagues-
“Your Excellency!” The voice rasped in-
sistent from behind the deckhouse.
“What do you want, Alonzo?” snapped the
Adelantado. But before the other could
come up he had swung round on his heel in
his impetuous way, and disappeared in the
blackness behind the deckhouse.
Voices murmured, footsteps echoed, died
away, and the soft slapping of the water
against the side was the only sound. A dia-
phanous cloudlet floated across the edge ot
the moon, and now a clear vision could have
descried, in front of the ribbon of blackness,
a ribbon of white, which might have been
sandy beach or the lather of surf.
“He is gone!”
The form of a young woman, wasp-waisted
in a cuirass-like stomacher, slid round that
side of the deckhouse which was exposed
to the moonlight. She paused, and, for an
instant, as she beckoned to someone behind
her, her long Indian profile, with its delicate,
curving lips and the wide-arched hollows full
of the velvety blackness of her eyes, seemed
poised against the sky. Then she turned
round and rustled softly up into the very
prow of the ship, followed by a man, lithe,
powerful and walking swiftly and silently,
with a kind of relentless intensity that
stamped him Aztec. Up here the deck was
piled with coils of hempen cables, with the
long, smooth barrels and wooden carriages
of two bow-chasers on either side, so that
no more of a man was visible than appears
above the waist. But before the Dona Marina
could sink down into this security, the
Mexican clasped both her shoulders from
behind and drew her backwards till their
lips met.
After a while they sat down on a coil of
rope, locked in each other’s arms. No
speech passed between them, only “Guate-
mozin. ... Malinche.. .. Malinche”.. . .
breathed softly. They, who all day played
their parts in a masque of dissimulation and
repression, for a few brief minutes knew
the sweetness of freedom. The drowsy
warmth of the night enveloped them, and,
for a space they were alone under the
immense pale bowl of the sky.
But their very preciousness made these
moments so fleeting that it seemed the last
had slipped through their fingers before they
had w r eil understood the wonder of the first.
“The council must be well-nigh over,” said
Marina, gently freeing herself from his arms.
“Come, Guatemozin, come ! We must go.”
Slowly, reluctantly, they drifted away and
the shadows by the deckhouse engulfed them.
The moon climbed in calm splendor towards
the zenith, the last timorous breeze died
away, and the surf boomed louder and
louder: “Come! Come! Come!”
* * * *
Guatemozin, in accordance with the Adel-
antado’s orders, was seated on a hamper of
victuals in the prow of the skiff, with a long
boat-hook in his hands, and instructed to
watch out for shoals or coral. The rising
sun had barely lifted above the wall of the
forest, and the morning was full of dewy cool-
ness and the tang of ozone. The mountains
gleamed transparent blue at the summit,
deepening into glooming indigo at the base.
Guatemozin took in their long, swelling
masses at a glance and shot his keen gaze
back into the dancing waves ahead. When
he again looked up he fixed his eyes on an
off-shoot from the main range which ran
down close to the coast. It was low, jagged,
serrated. It struck him that this was an
almost exact replica of the sierra above
his birth-town of Tezcaca.
A lance-butt prodded sharply into the
small of his back and he heard Father
Gomara’s voice rasping from the stern:
“Dost wish to run us aground and deliver
us as so many Jonahs to the fishes, dog:
Give him another prod, Juan, I pray you."
The Mexican bent his blazing eyes to the
water in silence.
The solid wall of trees, with its strip of
white sand, was swelling continually nearer,
and in less than ten minutes the keel grated
timidly on gravel. Guatcmozin jumped out
with four Spanish foot-soldiers, hauled the
boat up and stood aside whilst the Adelan-
tado and his officers, glittering figures in
armor, splashed through the shallow water
to dry land.
“Form them up,” said Della Torre to
Alonzo de Olid as soon as the other two
boats had drawn alongside and discharged
their freight. "Mendoza will advance the
standard.”
Breast-plates flashed, pikes caught frag-
ments of sun and tossed them back into the
air, then the whole clangorous company froze
into stiff-necked silence. For a space the
clicking of a firelock could have been heard
from one end of the line to the other. Then
Juan de Mendoza, with the mien and up-
turned gaze of a young Galahad, raised the
royal banner of Castille, and they advanced
up the beach behind its heavy-flapping
blazonry to take possession of
all this land in the name of the
most Catholic Sovereigns. The
Adelantado halted them before a
tree, stout and gnarled. He
strode up to it, gave three
strokes with his sword and pro-
claimed in a loud voice that he
took possession of this country
in the name and behalf of their
Most Catholic Majesties, and
would maintain and defend the
same with sword and buckler
against all who should gainsay
it. This the notary recorded and
attested.
The formal ceremony of pos-
session completed, the Adel-
antado took his stand in the
scant shade and ordered the re-
connaissance. Parties of three
foot-soldiers each were told off
with orders to separate and
scour as much of the country as
possible. Fleet Indian runners,
among whom was Guatemozin,
were to force their way inland
and prospect for gold-bearing
country. Friendly intercourse
with the natives, with the object
of ascertaining their civilisation
and any natural products, such
as gold and spices, which might
be of value to the Catholic
Sovereigns, was particularly de-
sired. Finally every man was
to order liis movements so that
he would be back on the beach
not later than one hour before
sundown.
Without wasting any time in
idle chatter Guatcmozin inti-
mated to his compatriots that
he was making towards the
sierra range, and went off at a
tireless jog-trot towards a high,
bare ridge about half a mile to
the south. The sand was
smooth and firm, but after a
w T hile he plunge'd into the bush,
directing as straight a course as the ground
permitted. Here, among the strange trees
with their glittering bunches of down-hanging
leaves, were bright-plumaged birds and bril-
liant flowers pendant from prickly creepers,
and once or twice reddish, bounding creatures
that drew a grunt of surprise and pleasure
out of liis fierce Aztec indifference. But
for the most part his thoughts centred in
the resemblance between the spur towards
which he was heading and the sierra above
Tezcaca which produced more gold than any
other two districts in Mexico together. The
serrations and the plane of the ridges were
similar, and the rock-strata, as far as he
could judge at that distance from the out-
crops, almost identical. Presently the forest
stopped as though at a magic line, and he
came out on the bare, grassy ridge, making
directly towards the .object of liis thoughts.
Long before midday he came to a little
valley, lying in the shadow of the nearest
peak, where a stream laughed and chattered
beneath the undergrowth. When he at last
forced his way down he plunged his face into
the clear water, rinsed out his mouth and
rolled a few drops on his tongue. Then
he loosed a shallow wooden dish from his
belt and scooped up a quantity of sand.
But there and at the other places he made
trial on that creek his work was fruitless.
He clambered up the mountainside till lie
came to a granite outcrop, and, shading his
eyes from the blazing sun, ran his gaze
over the ridges and undulating hills feature
by feature. Finally he turned off along the
crest of a spur and dropped down into the
valley at its extremity.
Here was a broad, placid creek, crossed,
as he had anticipated, by a bar of rock
almost exactly at the place where he emergeu.
He splashed out into midstream with the
self-possession of a man with implicit faith
in his own judgment who lias seen it already
well borne out. He dipped the dish once,
twice.... Round the rim, glittering specks
on grey sand, was a half-moon of gold. For
a moment all his Indian stoicism fell away
from him. He grunted with glee, lifted the
dish close to his eyes, rolled the tiny flakes
between his fingers.
The sun was westering when Guatemozin
poured a little heap of gold-dust into a pouch
of soft leather and secured it to the bronze
chain round his neck. He clambered up out
of the valley, over the spur, lost himself and
finally came out on the grassy ridge which
he had traversed earlier in the day. His
legs swung into a jogging stride, and the
miles glided away. To the left, at the foot
of the main range, a thin column of smoke
twisted up in the heavy air. This, the first
indication of human life he had seen all

Cutting the sandwiches before setting out was

Sandwich Delicacies in your pantry, and spreading
the tasty pastes on bread was a simple matter.
No necessity, either, to pile on an extravagant
thick layer to find a flavour.
Take REX Ham Pate, for example. It is pure
ham —delicious mild REX Ham in spreadable form.
Hence its true ham flavour and its great popularity
as a tasty sandwich spread.
It is also delicious for savouries and on buttered
fingers of toast.

day, excited his curiosity for an instant. He
stopped short, watched it, then ran his eyes
half-anxiously down the wall of the forest,
But the trees tossed their heads in their
careless sun-dance, the birds hunted and
played unalarmed, and in the silence it seemed
to him that his must have been the first
human foot ever to tread this ground. He
SUSPICIOUS, ANYWAY.
“Bobby, I don't want to have any more to do with you—you were blotto last night!”
“Oh, girl, I didn't do anything I shouldn’t have done, did I?"
“Well, you tried to light my fag with your luminous watch.”
shuffled into a trot and soon liis passing
interest was submerged in the stress of more
intimate thoughts, which puckered his brows
as he ran. Fortune had shown him favor,
but how could it be made to advantage
him? The question hammered in his brain
in time to the padding of his bare feet.
How, how? Presently he topped the last rise
and dipped down towards the beach with the
caravel beneath him like a toy ship on a
blue pond.
To the first man who accosted him on the
beach, a Mexican, he replied with a shake
of the head and, drawing him aside, in-
quired the results of the day’s exploration.
The Indian spread his hands and passed the
right quickly over his mouth. Natives had
been encountered, but they were bestial crea-
tures, without arts or agriculture, and with-
out knowledge of any higher race than their
own. There were no natural spices and, as
Father Gomara had forecast from the con-
formation of the land, no gold. The country
was worthless.
Guatemozin found the Adelantado sitting
apart from his officers, staring gloomily out
to sea and fretfully plucking at the golden
chain of his crucifix. Guatemozin stepped
forward and began his report in a sullen
voice, but had advanced the tale of failure
no more than a few words when Della Torre
sprang up, waving his hands in exasperation,
and strode down the beach to give orders
for embarkation.
-jc. * * *
Silver on the sea and in the sky and on
the steel facing of the bulwark, silver glint-
ing from the smooth-bellied breech of the
bow-chaser —and in their hearts, too, after
long darkness, the clear, silver gleam of
hope. Sharp, low cries floated up from the
soldiers gambling in the waist, sometimes
the noise of an altercation, the thrumming
of a taut rope or the plashing of the waters
—apart from this, only the sibilance of their
own voices, which barely penetrated as far
as the coils of rope behind them. Guate-
mozin twisted the little pouch of gold-dust
between his fingers as he spoke.
“At the foot of that spur which lies some-
what to the left of the high dome. But now,
Malinche, I know not how we shall best
make this of service to us.”
Malinche stirred in his arms, surprise
shadowing her eyes. “To me the way lies
straight, Guatemozin,” she said softly.
“The gods have given,” continued the
Aztec, as though he had not heard her,
speaking with the solemnity of his race —
“the gods have given, but this Torre is a
vulture of avarice rather than a man. I
lie in the pit of his hand ; and if _ he give
me the paltry reward these Spanish dogs
think good enough for an Aztec, I cannot
gainsay him. Thus would it be, a few pieces
of gold and a chunk of fatted meat. The
lying dog!”
“Nay!”
“Listen, Malinche. This is the counsel that
came to my brain as I ran down from the
hills. I will hold this secret tight as a
devil-fish holds its prey until we reach
Mexico. Then I will seek out Don Juan
Redo de Leon, he who befriended your
father and has ever been a friend to our
race, and from him I will get money to buy
my freedom and as much above that as this
mad dog”
“Nay, Guatemozin,” said Malinche gently,
pressing his arm as though to show her
words meant no denial of womanly submis-
sion, “he loves gold, like all his race, but he
is generous. He is cruel and a hothead, but
he is generous. Take this gold to him
and”
“I have trusted Spaniards,” said the Aztec
bitterly. „
“But think, Guatemozin, of the waiting.
Her voice pleaded. “Months of waiting
Don Juan will give you no reward until
you bring him to the place of the gold.
Months of waiting.” Then, as she saw how
her words moved him, she drew closer and
whispered vehemently, “I cannot, Guate-
mozin. Take this to him in the morning. I
will speak to him. He is generous. He
will listen to me.”
“He will listen to you!” A convulsion of
rage and impotent jealousy distorted Guate-
mozin’s face. “Truly!” 11 is hand jerked to
his side and he drew a small knife from his
belt, the hilt carved in the hideous likeness
of Quetzalcoatl, the blade of razor-sharp
volcanic flint. He bent over her with blazing
eyes. “Do you know the thing that is in
my mind, Malinche? To throw the gold into
the sea and plunge this knife into your
heart, then slay the Spanish dog and send
my soul swiftly after yours.”
As he hissed out the words he pushed the
knife forward until the cold blade touched
her breast. But then two brown arms slid
round his neck, and he heard her voice,
warm, soft, strangely fearless, whispering at
his ear.
“Our spirits will wander far apart, Guate-
mozin, for I have not yet been purified from
the Christian worship and thou has made
fresh obeisance. Think not of gods and
spirits—look at me! Am I not young? Am
I not beautiful? Do as I counsel you,
and within three months we shall be together
in Tlascala. Come, strike! Strike, Guate-
mozin !” And she laughed softly up into his
face.
Then before Guatemozin's gaze everything
swam about her eyes. He slipped the knife
back into his belt and folded her in his arms.
“Take it to him now—to-night,” she whis-
pered.
Guatemozin nodded slowly. “My freedom
and fifty pesos d’oro—that will place small
tax on his generosity. Pray that the ancient
ones have sent you good counsel, Malinclie.
I will speak to the Spaniard this night.”
He ceased abruptly, turning over in his
mind for the hundredth time the plan they
had contrived together of escape at a Mexi-
can port and a journeying by back roads to
Tlascala. Before, this had been no more
than a dream of despair, for lie knew well
that a runaway slave, penniless and travel-
ling half across Mexico, was doomed to cap-
ture and branding before he had started.
But now with money and clear credentials
of his freedom- True, the Spaniard would
make search for Malinche.... But there
was no reason to connect them with each
other; they would travel separately.
In the silence their thoughts went back
to the snowy sierra and the sun-shot mists
in Tlascala.
“There are no Spaniards in Tlascala,”
said Guatemozin, speaking softly and
slowly, as though he were chanting a treas-
ured song. “In Tlascala the maize grows
tall and the cattle are fat. I will buy many
cattle. The children wear flowers in their
hair. Dost thou remember, Malinche?”
Malinche dropped her head on to his
breast.
“I too wore flowers in my hair once,” she
said in the same far-away tone, twisting
her fingers in the chain about his neck. “They
wear aloe-flowers in Itzapan—those have the
sweetest scent. But I love the blue chiotli
of the sierras better. The mist and the sun
change and dance all day Jong in Chicameca.
The boys grow fierce and the girls strong
and comely”....
Her voice trailed away in the stillness and
they were silent. The pictures and remem-
brances of that homeland which long despair
had bleached to the pale unreality of a
dream had become real, vivid, imminent in
the flash of an instant. The shooting maize
swished about their feet, the scent of the
aloe-flowers was in their nostrils, their eyes
were set upon the winding path that led
to the secret temple where the Indians made
furtive obeisance to the ancient gods.
Thoughts too intense for speech these. They
sat clasped in each other’s arms, and their
thoughts, like the vibrations of two strings
of the same pitch, flew far away over the
sea.
The clanking of arms below announced
the changing of the watch. In ten minutes
Della Torre would come from his closeting
with Father Gomara to give his orders for
the night.
Malinche stirred in her lover’s arms. “The
watch! To-night, Guatemozin ! I will
speak to him,” she added in a timid half-tone.
Guatemozin inclined his head gravely.
After a pause he said calmly: “I will go to
the Spaniard now. I will show him the
gold. I will tell him everything.” He stared
out over the moon-flecked sea. “Malinche
.... Tlascala....these
words are like music,”
he said softly.
They rose and clung
to each other in the
long kiss of parting.
With slow steps they
threaded their way
down from the bow to-
wards the deck-house.
Then again they drew
towards each other and
their lips met. Far
below Father Gomara’s
voice sounded. They
heard nothing, for in
that moment their
world was bounded by
their arms.
It was not until they
were within an arm’s
length of the deck-
house that they saw
the black shadows dis-
gorge the blacker figure
of the Spaniard. He
came towards them
with head and shoul-
ders crouched like a
jungle-beast about to
spring; his body quiv-
ered visibly; his face
was livid, greenish in
the moonlight.
Marina shrank back
with a strangled cry.
But next instant she
threw herself between
them.
Della Torre flung her
aside and hurled him-
self at the Mexican,
clutching his throat
with one hand, strik-
ing across the eyes
with the other, hiss-
ing : _ .
“Dog! Son of a
heathen she-dog!”
There followed a blur of action. Guate-
moziti whipped the little idol-headed knife
from his belt; Della Torre wrenched his
wrist, secured the knife and an instant later
Guatemozin reeled back against the deck-
house with blood streaming from his neck.
But, before Della Torre could leap forward
to deal the finishing blow, Malinche got be-
tween them and clutched his right wrist
with both hands. She was screaming at
him in agony, trying to make him under-
stand something:
“Bertrand! Don’t! Don't! He has..--
He knows.. . . Oh —li!”
Della Torre swung round on her and saw
the frenzied pleading in her eyes. He caught
hex- by the shoulder and pushed her back-
wards, laughing insanely as he raised the
knife, laughing in her eyes as he drove home
under the left breast. She slumped across
the. bulwark with a sobbing, choking sound,
THAT’S WHERE THEY WOKE.

beer. But it doesn’t stop there. He gives you more and more beer until”
CHORUS: “What’s the name of the pub?”
and lie stabbed again and again until lier
body slid over the side. He leaned over,
looking down into the phosphorescent water,
Then he felt Guatemozin’s arms about his
throat.
When Alonzo de Olid came up with the
watch he found Guatemozin forcing Della
Torre over the bulwark inch by inch. Some-
body tripped the Mexican from behind and
two burly soldiers pinned him to the deck.
Della Torre struggled to his feet, staring
round him like a drunken man. _ For a
moment he did not seem to recognise those
about him. Then, as his face began to lose
something of its deathly pallor, he turned
round to an ensign, who was supporting him
by the arm.
“Lower the boat,” lie said, in a whisper.
“The Dona Marina has been cast overboard.
Stop!” he cried an instant later. "Too
late ! Come back, Ensign !”
He shook his head, as though trying to
set something into place, and began to
answer Alonzo de Olid’s questions.
“The Indian dog,” he said, speaking slowly
and harshly—“the Indian dog ran amok,
slew the I)ona Marina and cast her body
into the sea before I could reach him. Then
he tried to slay me, but I wrenched his
knife from him and wounded him in the
neck. Look, a filthy idol!”
“Thou liest, Spaniard,” cried Guatemozin,
struggling with his captors. “Thou slewest
the woman thyself.”
The Adelantado turned to his lieutenant
with the sad smile of a man who stands in
the shadow of an irreparable misfortune.
“He is possessed by one of the frenzied
devils he worships, if he raves any more,
have his tongue torn out. Ensign, make
search and see if the body of the Dona
Marina has been left to us. Hang him in
the morning, Alonzo!”
* * * *
His hands were bound in front of him
and the executioners stood behind him. The
noose was already about his neck and the
fading of the dawn-colors heralded the
approach of sunrise and the moment of
death. And then, in that moment of despair,
his chance came —the just-possible chance
that lie had turned over in his mind all
night, that had momentarily come within
his grasp when they had loosed the bonds
about his waist as they led him forth, and
which had been as quickly removed by the
Adolantado’s malignant order that, as a
discovered heathen and apostate, he be not
allowed to kneel before execution. But
now, with Della Torre and Alonzo de Olid
called away together by the noise of a
brawl, his chance came and he seized it
quickly, speaking to Father Gomara:
“Father, will you slay my soul with my
body? I am true Christian. Let me kneel
for so long as I may say a paternoster.”
And as he had expected the proud priest
motioned the hangmen back, saying in his
deep voice: “The mercy of God may not be
hindered by man. Kneel, my son, and God
have mercy on our souls!”
lie knelt. And now he was able to raise
his bound arms to his chest, as though in
prayer, to force his fingers deep into his
shirt until he had prised the little leather
pouch from its concealment and hidden it in
the palm of liis hand. The chanty of the
sailors weighing anchor came to his ears,
but his eyes saw the disc of the sun balan-
cing on the horizon of the Land of Parrots.
He rose and, as Della Torre and Alonzo de
Olid came back, he jerked his hands up
quickly so that the pouch of gold-dust sailed
far over the bulwark into the chopping sea.
Della Torre followed it with his eyes.
“What does the devil-worshipper cast
away?” he asked of the executioners.
The Mexican burst into a liarsh peal of
laughter. With the noose round his neck he
sent his triumphant mockery skimming over
the waters,
“An empire, Spaniard!”
Della Torre turned heavily to Father
Gomara and touched his head. He gave
the signal to the hangmen with a careless
wave of the hand.

speech at the bullocky’s send-off on Murrum-
bogie. “You don’t know what awful trouble’s
facing me,” he went on. “I feel like hopping
over to tli’ homestead an’ pinching a tin
of rabbit poison to do meself in.”
“Is it your aunt?” I asks.
“Yairs, it is. Sliprail, ol’ mate,” he says,
an’ he’s nearly blubbering over it.
After a bit of coaxing I gets the strong
of it all; an’, by cripes, it opens me eyes,
It seems that Dodger’s people in England is
the pure merinos, he bein’ a sort of black
sheep. Years ago, getting sick of ’em always
eliipping him, he tells ’em to get to blazes,
an’ hits the track for Australia. Before
he goes, though, he says to ’em he’ll be no
remittance man, but they’ll sit up when they
find out he’s a wealthy squatter an’ richer’n
’em all. Of course he never gets no station
of his own, not even a selection, an’ lie's
done-in all his notions about getting a lot
of goncc by the time I meets him first.
lie never writ home for thirty years, so
after his mother and father dies some of his
family remembers him an’ puts a notice in
the back-country papers among the tenders
for wool-carting and the stallion advertise-
ments. None of us blokes tumbles that
this notice refers to Dodger, because it
says a bloke be the name of Cecil Strange-
ways Planchette, an' it asks him to communi-
cate with a Missus Somebody in London.
Billy, when he sees it, don’t let on to nobody,
not even me, but lie sends word back.
If the darned old goat’d only stuck to the
truth it’d been ribuck. But always being
a bit of a leg-puller he puts up a few
beauties. He writes the first letter to ’em
about the time we started emu-bobbing on
Goorambil, then, not bein’ satisfied with a
fair thing, he gets in with the bookkeeper an’
borrows some of the writing paper the
manager has with the name of the station
printed on top. An’ hang me if he don.’t make
out he owns the run, an’ is about the
wealthiest squatter on the Lachlan!
There’s answers come for him, an’ the
bookkeeper, being an English bloke himself
an’ let inter the joke, gets ’em to Dodger
in due course. This goes on fer two shear-
ings, but it don’t matter much till this time
when we’re back at Goorambil waiting for
the roll-call. The morning we lobs there
Dodger cops the knockout. There’s a letter
the bookkeeper tosses him that says that
the aunt —a piece Billy can hardly remem-
ber —is coming out to visit him, and is goin’
to be there almost as soon as he gets the
letter.
“An’ what the blazes can I do?” says
Dodger, his face twitching an’ screwing as
if lie’s been slashing 1 prickly-pear for a
month.
“I’m not off-sidin’ for no aunts,” I says,
very severe. “The last time, you remember,
when I said I’d shepherd Ready-made Jack’s
aunt at th’ Condo Show, didn’t she get me
shikkered an’ the two of us gets run in?
You can look after your own aunt.”
“Ye’ll have to help me,” Dodger,
pleading like th’ Army blokes in front of
the pub in town on Saturday night.
Of course he talks me round in the finish,
an’ the best I can suggest is to have a word
with the bookkeeper, seeing as how he
knows so much about it. I’m feeling a bit
sore at not bein’ trusted at the start. We
chats the dude, an’ talks over all sorts of
plans till nearly daylight. It turns out as
how this bookkeeper’s met Dodger’s aunt in
England, an’ he says if we leave it all to him
he can fix things up so as she’ll never tumble
there’s anything crook about the tales Dodger
pitched. All wants to know is when th’
ol’ girl’s due. Billy says she’s to wire when
she’s leaving Sydney, so’s he can meet her
at th’ train in Condo an’ fetch her out.
The roll’s called next day, an’ me an’
Dodger’s pinking ’em pretty when Greville,
the bookkeeper, mooches along the board.
“A wire’s come fer you, an’ I opened it,”
he says. “She’ll land here next We’n’sd’y
morning.”
Poor ol’ Dodger gets a terrible shock. He
slices about a foot of wrinkle off a big
wether, an’ then lets the darned thing go
scooting down the board. His mug looks
like a bloke’s what’s booted out of a shanty
after lie’s blewed his cheque an’ has to face
the stock-route without a bottle to help him
along.
“Bear up!” says the bookkeeper. “For
the sake of Eating, I’ll see you through.”
When I asks Dodger afterwards about this
Eating, lie says it happened when he was at
school. Some big feed he had, most likely.
Just then we knocks off for smoko an’
mooches out to loaf about the wool-loading
stage. First thing I knows is Greville mount-
ing the platform like he was a politician, an’
singing out “Ladies an’ gents.”
“Look it here,” he says, an’ by cripes he
spouts as good as ol’ Toomey, the Mayor of
Condo, when he opened th’ new pound-yard
last year. “An’ esteemed an’ respected feller-
unionist, Mr. Planchette, Esq., otherwise
Billy the Dodger, who is known to yous all,
and is also known well and favorable in every
shanty an’ shearing-shed in the Backblocks,
is in serious trouble. No, there ain’t no need
for a tarpaulin muster. It’s something
more’n that. It’s something that can only
be give by big-hearted, noble-minded blokes
like what I knows you chaps is. It’s sacri-
fice of a lot for a day or so, to spare a
woman’s tender feelings. But you’re men
that’s been proved be fire an’ steel, an’ I
know you’re dinkum mates. Will you do it
for Dodger?”
There’s a lot of cheering, an’ then Liffey
Moylan asks what’s the lurk,
“It’s this way,” says Greville. “Dodger’s
aunt’s coming up here to see him next
We’n’sd’y. She’s an ol’ piece that’s come
all the way out from England to visit her
nephew what’s been lost for years. She’s
got the funny idea that Dodger owns this
run, an’ a lot of other stations on the river,
an’ it’ll break her poor ol’ heart if she finds
he’s just a rough but honest worker like our-
selves. Th’ English people think everyone in
the colonies is a squatter. To spare the
poor ol’ dame disappointment and anguish, I
want you to act while she’s here as if Dodger
really is the owner. She’ll only stay one
night—l’ll see to that—an th’ overseer’ll let
her camp in his cottage down by the dam.

play your parts to save a grey-headed lady
going in sorrer to the grave”
The blokes was willing all right. They
takes a vote an’ it’s unanimous. Th’ over-
seer an’ the boss o’ the board’s real keen,
and everybody’s talking about how to fix
the thing up. Even Dodger works up a bit
of a grin.
The next four days is as full of excitement
as Euabalong at race time. Ready-made Jack
makes a necklace of quandongs for th’ ol'
tart. I gets a couple of boomerangs from th’
abos. camp to give her. Other blokes has
rabbit- and fur-skins for presents. Some has
carved pipes an’ curly-yarran whip handles.
Ship-Ahoy makes two bosker waterbags ; Up-
she-Rises gets a brooch from an Indian
hawker with “Sweetheart” on it. Joe Carney
has a pair of polished bullocks’ horns, an’
Liffey Moylan cleans up them ol’ spurs he
found on the camping reserve. Even the two
Goulburn cockies that don’t mess with the
rest of us shearers gets busy in their camp
making a damper for her to take back to tli’
Old Dart.
On the Tuesday night Greville takes
Dodger across to the homestead, which is
about four mile from the shed. The last
thing he says before leaving is that we’re
to chuck swearing for a while, no matter
how hard it’ll be for some of us, an’ to call
Dodger by his dude name of Planchette.
They reckon they’ll arrive with th’ ol’ piece
about three o’clock next afternoon.
There’s not much shearing
done next day, we’re all as
excited as if we’re going to
tli’ Oddfellows’ Sports. We
spends most of the time
watching the stock route.
When we spots the dust rise
down by the ’orse paddock
we gets ready, an’ walks out
to give ’em a rousing wel-
come.
Up comes a fine turnout
with two high-stepping bays
—Charlie White’s, tli’ livery-

was, an’ hired a-purpose.
There’s Greville, sitting a
one side; in the middle a
little thin ol’ woman with
eyes that seemed to be laugh-
ing like anything, an’ cheeks
as red as some of them girls
in the shops in Orange. An’
handling the ribbons is th’
finest sort of an English dude
I ever see. He’s got a furry
sort of hat cocked a one
side; one of them monnikle
things in his left eye; a
short, spiky mo an’ a wide
grin. His clobber’s a knock-out. The
coat’q, got squares like a draught-board; he
has a high stiff collar, the same as town
blokes wear to dances, an’ white riding
breeches an’ polished leggings what them
Indian horse-buyers has when they’re knock-
ing round the stations.
We’re all silent until the dude gets out an’
lifts th’ old tart down as careful as if she’s
a stud ewe. Then he comes over to me an’
says:
“Sliprail, you blarsted fool, why didn’t
you give three cheers?”
Hang me if it ain’t Dodger, with a shave
and trim, an’ rigged out in some of the
togs Greville brought out from England
when he come but ain’t been game to wear!
When I gets my wind, I turns to the blokes
an’ yells out:
“This is Mr. Planchette Esquire’s aunt.
Give th’ lady a real bush welcome.”
After I wunk a lot, an’ swung me lid a
few times, they jerries, an’, by cripes, didn’t
they cheer!
Th’ ol’ piece smiles an’ bobs, an’ when we
stops she says she thanks us for our kind-
ness an’ hopes we respect an’ love her
nephew, though we’re only poor working-
blokes
“My oath!” yells Liffey Moylan. “My
colonial oath!” The jab I gives him in the
gizzard shuts him up from going fur.
I never got the full strength of liow
Dodger an’ Greville managed that evening
an’ next morning, and what tales they
pitched her. They tramps the poor ol girl
all over the shed, showing her crossbred
wethers an’ saying they’re stud rains, an
giving her bits of fleece to feel. They waltzes
her in an’ out of the drafting yards, tbrongii
the ’uts, an’ back to the wool Everj
time they come near us we says: les, sir,
Mr. Planchette, Esq., an does this suit.
or don't it?—an’ keeping straight faces all
the while, until wc can see Dodger’s getting
ropeable. At last they gets her to th’ over-
seer’s hut, which his wife had fixed up
proper for the visitor, an’ there they give
her some scran.
Ol’ Mclntyre, th’ cook, spreads himself
for th’ ol’ girl. They tell me she couldn’t
ha’ got a better feed in the two-bob touch at
the Royal, in Condo. _ They had
pigeons, a couple of wild ducks, and a plain
turkey, all of which Greville shot, besides
half a lamb roasted. There’s four sorts of
pudding, an’ a big cake with icing on it, an’
words that Mac. writ in pink letters, “Blest
is th’ pace-makers,”—-a sporting remark.
Th’ ol’ girl don’t eat much, though, they
tell me, for after she finishes a pigeon, half
a duck, an’ a bit of turkey an’ has a go at
two of the puddings she cuts out. As she’s
pretty tired they gets her to bunk early,
Dodger being terrible uncomfortable until
she disappears.
Next morning when Dodger’s showing her
round the shed again, Greville comes in with
a telegram.
“Mr. Planchette, Esq,,” he says, very
politely, “there’s bad news from the west, an’
it pains me to be the bearer of such hor-
rible tidings, for it’ll mean that your aunt’ll
have to go back to Sydney to-day.”
“Speak up, me man,” says Dodger; “let’s
know the worst.”
“Well,” says Greville, “there’s a strike
on your station at Hillston, there’s a bush-
fire on your run at Menindie, there’s footrot
among the sheep at Cobar, an’ the bush-
rangers has stuck up the ’omestead at
Bourke. I’m afraid ye’ll have to leave at
once.”
“Dear me,” chirrups th’ old girl, “what
terrible things to happen! They told me
Australia was a frightful place, an’ I didn’t
believe it. I’m afraid it’s no place for a
poor lorn old creature like me.” She looks
so sad at Dodger an’ the rest of us that
we feel real ashamed putting this up on
her. But Billy pulls himself together.
“I must leave you aunt, an’ I’m afraid
you can’t stay here, much as I’d like it.
There ain’t any women of your class in these
parts. Duty calls, an’ it may be years before
I get back here. You’ve seen how great
wealth brings big responserbiiities, an’ I
know you’d scorn me if I squibbed it. Tell
’em at home that Cecil came through better
than lie dreamed.”
There’s more talk, and finally she gets
ready to pull out. The poor ol’ girl’s cry-
ing as she dukes the mob of us and thanks
us for the presents we hand her. As she
goes out to th’ buggy, which Greville has
ready, we gives her a cheer; and though she
still has tears in her eyes, she grins brave
but sorrerful, an’ waves a little handker-
chief at us.
Dodger, on th’ overseer’s horse, rides with
’em to the first gate, an’ that’s the last we
see of him for a week. When he does come
back, scrubby-faced and dirty, an’ we starts
chiacking him, he does his block, and has
a cut at four or five of us one after another.
Because he fights like a bloke in the d.t.’s,
we’re sorry he ever had a blooming aunt.
Just before the cut out, though, he calls
the boys together one night an’ makes the
queerest speech you ever hear, using all the
lar-di-dah stuff like when I first knew him.
First he thanks us for giving his aunt such a
good spin. Then getting a funny look on
his dial, he says some mixed-up stuff about
eating husks with swine an’ a fat calf. After-
wards he gets on to talking sorrerful about
things that wasn’t as might have been, an’
wasted lives, an’ the blight, until we all
has the pip, an’ feel as miserable as bandi-
coots, even if we can’t get the drift of
what he says.
But what bamboozles me most is when
we’re throwing up our swags next day he
says to me, lookin’ round on the blokes
what’d seen ’im through:
“Sliprail, ol’ mate,” he says, “there’s still
some very gallant gentlemen in the world.”

Finis.
OLD earth sighs wearily. Until to-morrow
Night kisses her tired eyelids into
sleep.
All the day’s guerdon 'of denial and sorrow
Is buried where the blue is softly deep.
Tired, tired is all the world. Can you re-
member
Desires lialf-dreamed of when the sun
was high?
Illusions burn to one slow-glowing ember,
The flames of old antagonisms die.
The late moon climbs along a track of glory,
And a hushed wind is full of unshed tears.
There is heartbreak at the end of every
story,
And quiet night to crown the flying years.
MAORILAND. BETTIE RIDDELL.
Freedom.
I AM poor, I am shabby—unashamed—
But I dwell with the sun and the moon;
I am one with the wild and untamed,
And the day is my own at the noon.
I have asked not of any man an alms,
But the snare and the net are my friends;
Supple are the fingers and the palms
Of the hands that no labor offends.
Yet when I work a man’s work I do,
But I work and I rest as I will;
As of old the road is for the few—
The many bear the yoke on them still.
Comforts I may lack, but comfort I have,
I soften not to bed nor to board;
Sleep comes sweet, no pillow is its grave,
Appetite at morning my reward.
Loneliness I know not; not even though
All through the year I make camp alone ;
Not while I hear, where men come and go
A hoof at a canter strike a stone.
Down comes the quartpot if a passer stop:s,
Down from the nail driven in the tree;
The horse shakes its forelock as it crops,
And the bridle on the mane falls free.
Out comes the damper from the dilly-bag;
We sit and yarn awhile and smoke,
Silent where a silence does not drag,
Warm as though a word unspoken spoke.
Then the news that is going comes to me—
Man’s tremendous trifles of a day!
If Higgins got his new axle-tree,
Or did Smith get the tyres for the dray.
And I hear about the little stranger who,
Like a myall summer, came too soon;
If Mick with the teams is getting through,
Is the creek still dry at Akaroon....
In a swing of the pendulum of time
Will the kings of the earth pass away;
They will go like an hour at the chime.
And no dust of them ask: Who are they?
Where no dust asks of any who are they
I shall go at the last as the kings ;
So I count —lest the end be dismay—
No worth but the moment as it swings.

Death Ship.
THERE was lio noise of chains. The dark
ship moored,
Emblem of storms survived and fears en-
dured ;
Then numerous little boats —what speed
they made! —
Emerged from under the dark ship’s tower-
ing shade.
Up to the beach the furtive dinghies crept;
Out of his boat each oarsman stealthily
stepped.
Then slow, with stooping backs and clutch-
ing hands,
Each to his task came stealing up the sands.
None heard the tread of heavy, soundless
feet
Coming to the appointed lane and street.
Oh heavy, soundless feet! None heard your
tread
As each ghoul kept appointment with his
dead!
Soon they returned beneath their burdens
bowed;
Through the black rags the straining
muscles showed.
Soon they returned and gasping, oily-wet,
Upon the sands their hapless burdens set.
And then I saw—what matter what I saw?
Why did the moon her cloudy curtain draw?
I had a friend among their pallid prey—
Nothing remained to do and little to say!
(He, cold, awaiting that long-journeying
craft,
Was feather, pile and nock of the flying
shaft;
And as the moon trailed through her cloudy
gown
The stars that were his aim looked quietlv
down.)
Each burden borne to its appointed boat,
The oarsmen took the oars and went afloat—
I saw the spreading beetle-wakes they made
Till lost within the dark ship’s mothering
shade.
No sound of chains, the anchor came up
slow-;
She turned into the dark —I watched her
SO ;
Then backward, like a cry and clear as flame,
A drifting fragment of his music came.

But I Remember.
T HAVE forgotten how the weeds ran wild,
■* And how the unkempt branches overhung
The garden where I dreamed, while yet a
child,
Beside the wall where lilac censers swung:
But I remember, ever so long ago,
The scent of those lost years, on days like
these—
Madonna lilies in a silver row,
And scarlet poppies maddening the bees.
I have forgotten how the dark scrub seemed
To prison in the little, shingled home;
The deep defiles where little sunlight gleamed.
The wild, black hills we somehow feared
to roam:
But I remember, l in a day that’s dead,
How the great island gums their arms
up-thrust
To touch the leaning heavens overhead
In templed silence, beautiful, august.
I have forgotten how I used to build,
Not long ago, castles in airy Spain,
And how my sparkling wine of life was
spilled
In desert sand, ne’er to be drawn again:
But I recall how lightly went my feet
And tireless down the rutted road of days,
And how my little world grew more complete
With some loved task and lovelier meed
of praise.
v I f
I have forgotten many a word and token
That wrought its share of ill along the
years;
I have forgotten how my heart was broken,
And healed, with the hot, bitter drop of
tears:
But I recall, in the late August weather,
How once we trysted in the star-bright
hours
(Blown wind, blown hair, and khaki hat
and feather)
Beneath the branching snow of almond
flowers, i
I have forgotten oh so many things
Better remembered, I call not to mind
The evil and the good achieved. The wings
Of careless memory far outstrip the wind'
But I remember, in a darker year,
When faith .and courage fail and fear
grows stronger,
This oft-renewed and daily answered prayer
To keep you loving me a little longer!

A shadow moon

SONG’S inspiration of our sorrow’s euro,
Vine ! may thy clusters, mellowed in the

Come to the vintage, may thy roots endure,
And yearly load the boughs for many a
one
Till hereabouts no thirsty soul may crave
A boon of Bacchus, nor a dreamer know
The inspiration that the wine-cup gave
The wooers of the muses long ago ;
As in the warm grass then where he is laid
The crickets chirp, or a cicada will
Make in the boughs the music that was made
When thou wert young, and I was sing-

Then haply when all vines have had their
day,
And sorrow, like the grape, has passed away.

Hands.
I HEARD my hostess speaking of a guest.
“Hunting big game is what he likes the
best,”
She said; “he went alone, without a guide,
Into the jungle, where he nearly died.
There was a night in which he passed
through Hell —
But he is silent; little can I tell
Except that round about his hut would rage
The jungle monsters in their pilgrimage: •
The leopard with its tierce and cunning
mind
Driven by hunger, frantic, mad and blind,
And subtle stealthy things with jungle souls
Urged by the devastation it controls.
There was a night in which his cartridge
spilled
A lion's blood, and all the air was filled
With the wild fury of a tortured breath
That warned the others of a monarch's
death,
While savage mates, avengeful of their dead,
Bayed at the moon with fear-uplifted head.
There was one night when, wakened by the
gold
Of something moving through the hut s grey
fold,
He found his rifle missing from his side,
And two green eyes that challenged, round
and wide.”
My heart beat swiftly. “What did this man
do?”
I asked my hostess, though I felt I knew.
“He choked the monster with his two bare
hands —
His hands are sure and supple as steel
bands.”
Then, as things often do, quite carelessly,
The subject changed. A maid brought in
the tea.
But, somehow, all my eyes could see or keep
Were memories of a tawny tiger’s sleep,
Captured so surely that it made no cry;
I shuddered strangely, though I knew not
wdiy.
And then he came. “Meet my young friend,”
said she,
Our hostess, leaving him with me.
His cruel, ruthless hand about my own
’ Closed with the subtlety I had foreknown
Would lie beneath his fingers’ tempered steel,
Which, though I hated, still I longed to feel.
He looked at me through strange and half-
veiled eyes.
With latent thoughts that I could but sur-
mise :
“I dreamed of you, as dream all lonely men,
One night within the jungle darkness when
The native chieftains with their customs
proud
Chose a young girl from the assembled crowd
And took her from her tribesmen as they
do
To be a captive bride —I thought of you.”
I listened as he spoke: his breath I heard.
Between my heartbeats and each spoken
word.
Then: “Kiss me, my Madonna,” swift he
said,
His strange eyes lighted with a glint of red,
And. with his hand, he lightly twisted back
My throat against his shoulder. Almost black
Against the pallor of my skin, the glow
Of his bronzed fingers lay as if on snow—
Fingers of steel whose warmth upon me
curled
As with a passionate strength against the
world.
His lips met mine, his hand’s strange tight-
ening
Thrilled through my blood with woman-
frightening,
And. like the tawny tigress Death had
wronged,
I knew that to that hand I. too, belonged!

Baltic Bells.
(After a Northern Legend.)
OH, there are strange lost legions never
listed
Save in an idle tale,
And tangles all too taut to be untwisted
Till the light fail.
And this the tale they tell who go down
daily
In ships beside the sea
To seek their bread all gloomily or gaily,
As these things be,
And cast the net and draw the net aglisten
With sea harvest fair,
And hush the heart and hold the breath and
listen
With a muttered prayer
To muffled bells, low heard above the moaning
Of waters, mute anon,
Or swelling high above their grave intoning
Like a glad carillon.
Or was it dream or ghostly tritons blowing
Upon their hollow shells,
That eerie diapason, ebbing, flowing,
Of sunken bells?
Bells of the Baltic in their steeples rocking,
So comes the story down,
Of sea-born things like green arms inter-
locking
Round a lost town
Where through the street no human footstep
passes,
And the great fishes go
Like lazy argoes through the pale sea grasses
Slug-like and slow.
Pillar and arch and battlement unlifted
As ere the word went forth,
And o’er their place the moaning waters
drifted
In the Oaves of the North.
Some wan Lostwithal, nameless even in story,
Dim hostage of the Sea,
Huddled with ooze and moss and sea-wrack
hoary
Unto Eternity ;
Some mighty page of history unwritten,
Some lyre unstrung,
Some Rome by more than mortal armies
smitten
When Time was young;
And the great ships go to and fro above her
Who sleepeth very sound
With her lost galleons and the Sea to cover
Her, dreamless, drowned,
While through the war of winds, the sullen
rolling
Of the Deep’s threnody
Men hear the bells of her drowned elm relies
tolling
Under the sea.
Oh. there are strange lost legions never listed
Save in an idle tale,
And tangles all too taut to be untwisted
Till the light fail;
And some are fables based on old confusion
Of half-remembered spells;
But the Sea holds, in truth or dire illusion,
Her Baltic Bells.

The Book.
WHEN I am old 1 shall make, maybe,
A book of laughter and love and grief,
And out of the isles and the purple sea
I shall take for it colors past belief,
All the rich sweet scent of the evi-tree,
The surge of waves on a circling reef.
Oh sails that over the blue seas lean —
White sails that are lone in the burning
blue,
Or dim ’neatli a sky with stars serene—
You will pass the book of my dreamings
through
By the palm-grown shores, by the yellow
sheen
Of a beach with the bright tide washed
anew.
And there shall sigh through it endlessly
Wind in the palms like a falling rain,
And the frangipanni’s shed ivory
Will flake its pages, and I shall stain .
The heart of it red from the memory
Of dawns tha,t never will break again.
When the long, long years lie grey between,
Brave with laughter, with love aglow.
And scarred where a burning grief had been,
I shall make my book, and no soul will
know
I buried my heart on an island green
And laughed on its grave long, long ago.

“WORDS MAY COME AND WORDS MAY GO,
BUT SHE”
“The trouble with my wife is she will have the last
word.”
‘Lucky dog! My wife never gets there!”
“Solomon’s” is Izador, and that “I. Solo •
mon” is Izaac; Izador being known as Izzy
and Izaac as Ike. Happily the two Jews are
nothing alike in build. Izzy has the short,
rotund figure of a little man grown to an
alderman, while Ike is long and thin, with
a nose that started out to be an eagle’s but
drooped.
There was not a madder man in Sydney
than Izzy, the first established in the build-
ing, when he saw Ike’s name written next
door. “As if this is the only tarn building
in Sydney!’’ he complained. “There will be
trouble, I say, trouble galore.”
And there was.
Perhaps Izzy was too suspicious. At any
rate, when Ike started business Izzy got in
the habit of leaving his door open so that
he could see who and what passed to Ike’s
office. And it was in this way that he came
to see a certain landlord who had a genius
for buying tenements in Iledhill —the dis-
trict in which, as fate had it, both Solo-
mons did most of their business. So Izzy
played Mary’s lamb to the landlord and fol-
lowed him about all day and found out just
what that good fellow was after. With the
result that Izzy, not Ike, sold the landlord
a certain terrace of dilapidated cottages in
Iledhill.
Was Ike mad? He called Izzy a “tirty
tain Jew” —and sundry other things. But
Izzy only gloated and sneered. “As if,” he
said—“as if I’m afraid of that tirty tarn
Hebrew!” Then he chuckled, and “Scared
of him paying me out? Me? Izador Solo-
mon ! No, my poy, he ain’t got brains
enough. Me it is has the brains and pizi-
ness ability. Understand, hey?”
Now Izzy wasn’t a bad little man, and
could be excused for slipping from the
righteous path sometimes. For instance, you
couldn’t hang him for opening letters
addressed to “I. Solomon,” which sometimes
the postman carelessly delivered to him be-
cause the postman called him “Izzy.” That
wasn’t dirty work—it was opportunity. Yet
Ike was mean enough to cause trouble when
he learned that Izzy, through one such mis-
take of the postman, had sold two shops
which by all rights he, Ike, should have sold.
Ike became quite mad, and wrote to
the Postmaster-General about it. So the
postman was more careful —for a while.
Just for a while. And then one day he
delivered another letter to Izzy that was
Ike’s. Izzy might have handed that one on
to Ike had not the envelope borne the
official stamp of the iledhill Council. Any-
thing to do with Iledhill always intrigued
Izzy.
With his tongue in his cheek Izzy began
to read —but he hadn’t read far before he
broke out into a cold sweat. “Dear Sir,”
the letter ran, “We have to inform you that
Izador Solomon, Dagg’s Chambers, Castle-
reagh-street, Sydney, is the owner of Lot 45,
Clarke-street, Redhill. But, out of fairness
to your client, we would like to state that
the building erected on the said lot will be
condemned at to-morrow night’s meeting of
the council.”
Izzy choked. Condemned!
His property condemned!
What a damn fool he -'was
not to have slapped some
paint on it, pumped the
water out of the cellars and
had the drains cleaned? A
damn fool! And he’d paid
£2OOO for that block —be-
cause it was such a good
shop site. Not only that;
last week he had refused' an
offer of £2500 for it. Re-
fused because he had an idea
the bidder would go higher!
His tubby form was quiv-
ering with indignation as he
patrolled his office. There
was a mistake somewhere,
surely? He couldn’t throw
good money away by pulling
that place down. He’d have
to do something, quick.
Now and then he’d tap his
black bowler hat farther
down over his ears as he
paraded. Now and then his
arms would semaphore. •
He swore frequently. Then,
in desperation, he reached for
the ’phone to call the coun-
cil just to make sure of what
he had read. But' as he
touched the machine inspira-
tion struck him. Struck him
so suddenly that he was
breathless. That client of
Ike’s —perhaps he was the
man who had offered £2500?
perhaps....
Izzy teetered in his chair.
He looked up at the ceiling
and smiled. Then, on tiptoe,
he went and shut the office
door and came back to his desk. In the bot-
tom left-hand drawer of that desk were the
fruits of Izzy’s one hobby—-collecting other
people’s stationery. From Government letter-
heads to mauve sheets of private notepaper,
there was a fine assortment in that drawer.
Because, Izzy said, you never knew. Now he
glowed with joy as he drew forth a sheet
of the Redhill Council's stationery and one
of its headed envelopes.
Being thrifty, he was his own typiste—
and slowly, one finger only in use, he spelled
out a letter which he addressed to “I. Solo-
mon.”
" Dear Sir, —We have to inform you that Izador
Solomon, Dagg’s Chambers, Castlereagh-street, Sydney,
is the owner of Lot 45, Clarke-street, Redhill. The
council’s valuation of this property—unimproved—
is £lBOO.
The copying of the undecipherable sig-
nature of the other letter was an easy
matter. And then Izzy gave himself up to
day-dreams. Ike w’ould fall
—fall hard. The council
valued the property at £ISOO,
hey! Well, any fool would
know from that it w r as worth
£2500. Even Ike would.
Izzy made it his business to
go out to Redhill to post the
letter after lie had closed his
office that afternoon. In the
morning, he promised him-
self, tilings would happen.
Poor Ike ! Izzy could hardly
sleep that night he was so
busy thinking of what he
would say to Ike.
He was at the office at
nine o’clock sharp, but it was
nearly ten before Ike, on his
way to the office, stopped at
the open door.
“ 'Day, Solomon,” said
Ike.
“ 'Day, Solomon,” echoed
Izzy.
“Who’d you rob yester-
day?” Ike asked.
“A tirty tain Hebrew,”
Izzy returned cheerfully.
And when Ike had gone
Izzy chortled. The Hebrew,
he told himself, w r as trying
to be friendly—because he
expected the letter from the
council. He would get it.. . .
Izzy, for a moment, was
sorry he wasn’t
going to deal with
the client. Perhaps
there would be more
money in that. Yet,
no. By selling
through Ike he
would prove Ike
was unreliable.
Perhaps, even, Ike,
for selling a con-
demned property,
would have to get
out of business !
Izzy began to
grow impatient. He
answered the tele-
phone, made calls,
interviewed visiting
clients, and still
Ike failed to come
in. Perhaps some-
thing had gone
wrong? Izzy kept
one eye on the door.
And then Ike
dumped himself
iu a chair. Bland,
grinning Ike, with
his eagle’s nose
a-droop. Izzy pre-
pared for the
battle.
Ike opened it
“Land’s selling
badly, Solomon,’
he said.
“For bum sales-
men, it is,” Izzy
sneered.
Round and round, round and rounu, they
argued for nearly half an hour before Ike
mentioned the Redhill property. Then they
got down to business. Izzy, reluctantly, said
he would sell if he got his price. He wanted
£3OOO. Ike called him a thief, and offered
£2OOO. It wasn’t a barter —it was a brawl.
A brawl of words, gesticulations, jumpings
up and down.
In the end they agreed on £2500. And
Izzy, though glowing inwardly, grumbled
about being robbed as he typed out the con-
tract.
Izzy’s glow was not so much from the fact
that he had got rid of the property at a
decent profit as from the knowledge that Ike
himself was purchaser. Ike himself! What
would Ike say if he knew the property was
going to be condemned?
Five hundred pounds was the deposit Izzy
had insisted on, and he fingered the cheque
lovingly when Ike handed it to him.
“Yell, Solomon,” said Ike, “I’m going up
right away to haf this contract registered.
I don’t trust you.”
“And me,” shrilled Izzy. “I’m going to
present this cheque at the bank. I don’t
trust you.”
Izzy more than glowed. He was triumph-
ant. The bank told him that the cheque
was good. What a laugh he would have in
the morning! What a laugh !
Izzy was surprised to see Ike come in in
the morning. His bowler was at a slant, and
from his lips projected an enormous cigar.
Ike looked not a bit like a man who had been
taken down, but just as if he had made a
killing.
Izzy, however, recovered himself. “Haf
you sold that land?” he asked, and rubbed
his hands together.
‘‘No, not yet,” returned Ike. “But I’m
going to fix it up to-day.”
Izzy pretended surprise. “Vat? You going
to fix it up to-day? Didn’t you know 7 the
council contemned it last night?”
Strange, the bombshell didn’t disturb Ike.
AESTHETIC-
-AND ANAESTHETIC.
“Vat you talking about? Tin; council didn’t
contemn it,” he said.
Something seemed to be going wrong inside
Izzy. “But they vas to contemn it last
night,” he blurted.
“You’re mad,” said Ike. “Vy, they re-
sumed it.”
“Vat!” howled Izzy. “Resumed it?”
“Yes,” gloated Ike. “For three thousand
four hundred quid.” |
Izzy seemed to be drowning. He felt like
it. Words choked in his throat, but all he
could do was flop his hands about like the
wings of a beheaded fowl.
Ike’s eyes glowed. “Bah, Solomon!” he
chuckled. “You ain’t the only one that gets
wrong letters. Last week I got one from
the council addressed to you. It told me
they was going to resume the land. Vat did
I do? Veil, you’re not the only one that
collects stationery.' See, I wrote you a
nice letter and forged a signature that ain’t
no one’s signature. Vy? Because you sold
a terrace and some shops I should have
sold. See? I do not forget dirty tricks,
Solomon. ‘We haf to inform you that the
property is contemned’! Contemned —-oh, my
Gawd!” His laughter was a yell.
Izzy was recovering. Ike bolted, and an
inkwell chased him.
“The tirty tain tief! The tirty tarn tief!”
That’s all the purple-faced Izzy could ex-
claim.

work as well as worry and expense, which
wall make up for a lot. Besides, you’ll
be able to give more time to her during
the wedding-eve, and everything will go off
pleasantly for both of you on the day.
Then you 11 go off yourselves—go off full-of
joy and sunshine and plans for the future,
after the wedding breakfast and the kissing
and hand-shaking.
You’ll spend your honeymoon at home at
your little brown homestead. It will be
quieter there, and you’ll be more to your-
selves than you would be at a strange place.
But you won’t decide to spend it there
merely because it has those advantages, but
more because, having put your heads together
a score of times and thought everything out
carefully, you both concluded that unless
Papa (Josie always calls Old Silas “Papa”)
comes good with a hundred or two in cash
as a wedding present for all Josie’s done
for him in the home and in the dairy,
helping to make him independent, you won’t
be able to afford a trip anywhere, as you’ll
want all the money you’ve scraped together
and saved to pay for the furniture and addi-
tions to the home. And though Old Silas has
got over all the objections he had to you
personally, and holds the wedding in his
house for you, and tells the guests with
tears in his voice when replying to the toast
of the bride’s parent that he’s sure she’s
selected the right man for her husband—-“a
good, industrious, God-fearing young Aussie”
—and that he's proud to have' you for a
THEIR UPS AND DOWNS.
“But a girl like you knows nothing of the ups and downs of life!”
“Oh, don’t we? Most of us know a lot about keeping appearances up and expenses
down!”
so*.- -in-law, you won’t see his cheque among
the presents. In the excitement of becoming
a father-in-law he’ll forget all about it. But
you’ll know he doesn’t mean anything by it—-
that it’s only a part of his nature. Lots of
well-to-do men and fathers of families are
absent-minded about presents.
When at last you’re stealing away from
the festival, with your bride in her travelling
dress on your arm and all the old women
gathering round her to say the last good-bye
and whispering hints in her ear, Old Silas
will be engaging some of the favored guests
in the parlor, and he’ll be shaking his head
as lie tells them that you should have been
able to afford to take her for a trip to the
Blue Mountains or somewhere, if you were
“any sort of a man at all,” especially after all
the help he’s been giving you. But as you’ll
be rolling along the lanes in the sulky while
he’s saying it, with your arm around Josie,
and smiling under her liat at her whenever
you risk taking your eyes off the horse, you
won’t hear him, and so won’t be perturbed
by the impression he’s giving them of you.
So you’ll spend your honeymoon in your
own way, and enjoy it as much as any
millionaire could. And the little home you’ll
take Josie to will be as comfortable as most
of the homes where young couples begin
married life in the bush. Besides, the time
you would otherwise have wasted travelling
long distances by rail or by boat, and stroll-
ing about sea-shores and streets and parks,
you can devote to building a wash-house or
something for Josie, or making her a vege-
table garden ; and you’ll be able to undo a
lot of little things you did on your own
account months before, and do them all
over again under her direction and to her
liking, and so have the place looking just as
she wants it to look when her young friends
come along to pay their first visits. A bride’s
young friends are full of eyes for the place
she’s living in when first they visit it.
The first to call, though, will be Old Silas
himself. One afternoon lie’ll arrive in the
sulky, gazing about at everything on your
little homestead as he approaches. Of course
you won’t be expecting him, and when Josie
excitedly announces that “Papa is coming,
Dick! Here’s Papa!” and runs out to meet
him, you’ll get in a funk, and start scraping
dough from your hands so that he won’t
see you’ve been filling in the honeymoon
showing Josie how you used to make dampers
for yourself.
“Well, I’m glad to see- you, my girl! And
how are you getting along in your new
home?” Papa will greet her. “The Lord is
watching over the two of you. I hope.”
Then, as he enters the door:' “Dick. I sup-
pose, is out and hard at work again ?”
Josie, blushing and smiling proudly on
your behalf, will answer that you’ll be there
in a minute—that you haven’t done much
yet except to milk the cows in the morning;
“it wouldn’t do not to milk them.”
“No, no, of course,” Silas will agree,
taking stock of the bit of furniture you've
started the home with, as he settles himself
on the new sofa—“they’d soon be all
ruined.”
Meanwhile you’ve freed the infernal dough
from your fingers and straightened your
shirtsleeves, and. combing your hair with
your hands, you’ll come from the kitchen and
welcome your father-in-law in a stammering,
uncertain voice, and with a face beaming
with fabricated grins. Though it’s your
honeymoon, you can’t help feeling ashamed
of being discovered inside the house idling
the happy hours away, and at a time, too,
when you know all the other men m the
district are out in the paddocks working toi
their lives.
And you can’t converse freely and get as
near to your father-in-law as you would like
to when all the time you are doubtful how
to address him—whether you should call him
“Papa,” the same as Josie does, or stick to
“Mister King.” Several times it will be on
the tip of your tongue to call him Papa, but
r.ot being brought up to it. the attempt will
stick in your throat. Still, after a wdnle
you’ll begin to feel more like a relation;
and when at last he asks in an interested
way, “Are you going to plant any barley
this year, Dick, or put all your ground under
wheat?’’ you'll come out with; “Oh, I think
I'll put it all under wheat, Papa.” As soon
as you hear what you’ve said you’ll turn
crimson and look like a criminal. And when
you see Josie trying to keep from laughing,
and Old Silas himself biting at bis under-lip
as if it was your tongue he had between his
teeth, you’ll feel sorry you spoke, and
inwardly determine to see him dead before
you’ll make such an ass of yourself again.
But you’ll forget all about it in a minute
or two ; and you’ll get on so well together
that you’ll be showing him the improvements
you’ve made to the farm, and be telling him
of all you intend making; and Old Silas will
nod approval and appreciation. And when
Josie in her turn shows him all you’ve done
to make the little home comfortable for her,
winding up with the wide verandah that you
added, and explains in raptures that all she
wants now to complete her joy is a small
room on the end of it so she can accommo-
date an extra visitor any time, there may
be a rush —or “where you could sleep your-
self, Papa,” she’ll enthuse, “whenever you
come and stay with us” —you’ll start wonder-
ing with a fast-beating heart if Old Silas
will open his purse and build the room for
you. Just for tile moment a beneficent
iook on his face will give you the. impression
that he might. But. it will only be for a
moment. Instead of opening his purse he’ll
open your eyes.
“There’s a room on the verandah of that
little old deserted place on the Reserve,
Dick,” he’ll suggest, turning to you. “It
would just suit this verandah if the white
ants haven’t got into it.”
“Where all the goats camp?” you’ll grin
in disparagement, and cast a glance of
disappointment at Josie.
“But you won’t want the (/oats !” he’ll
bark at you. “You ought to be able to‘get
it at a bargain from the Council. And it
wouldn’t take you more than a day to pull
it down and cart it away while the weather
is fine.”
For a while you can’t decide what answer
to make. But reading your face like a baro-
meter Josie will change the subject.
“There is one other thing, though, that
Dick- has to get for me, Papa,” she’ll say, -
with a cheerfulness that only a woman can
produce at will.
“Well, if there’s only one, you’re not like
your poor mother-was —God rest her in her
narrow bed—when she got married.” And
for a moment or two he’ll piously close his
eyes.
“And that’s a good sulky horse,” Josie will
conclude. “One I can have to drive when-
ever I want to go out without worrying Dick
for any that he is working.”
“Yes,” Old Silas will concur, regarding
her thoughtfully with his hollow eyes. And
once again you’ll get a notion that he means
to do something big and generous. You’ll
know that his grass-paddocks are over-run
with horses of all descriptions, and your
mind will turn to familiar forms of several
young colts, any one of which would make
an ideal sulky horse for a woman.
“A good sulky horse, my girl?” he’ll echo
in reflection. And you reckon your father-in-
law is going to come good this time for sure—•
perhaps make a present of two of those
horses, one to each of you 1 . In fact, before
lie can speak the word you’ll be wondering
whether it would be wiser to put your
registered brand on them both or wait till
Josie applies for a brand of her own to put
on hers. But when at last Old Silas opens
his mouth to speak he’ll turn to you again
and remark: “Well, horses are very cheap
just now, Dick, and you oughtn’t to have
any trouble getting wliat you want at the
saleyards almost any Saturday.”
Oh mighty! A sinking feeling will come
over you again ; but you’ll feebly agree with
him. Then, recovering, you’ll reckon the first
thing you arc going to do when you get
back into harness is “run into the saleyards
with a few quid in your pocket, and see
how horses are going.” You’ll be inclined
to let the matter end there, but your father-
in-law was always fond of talking about
horses, and will wonder that, you haven’t
got a few spare ones running on your farm —
“you never know when you want them,” he’ll

add as lightly as though acquiring horse-
flesh is as easy to you as gathering firewood.
But when you start coughing instead of
answering him, he’ll gaze through the
window at your yards and cowsheds and
ask: “How many cows are you milking?”
Here Josie, like the splendid help-mate
she promises to be, will come to your rescue
again. “Dick’s been milking ten up to
now, Papa; but with me to help him, from
this on he’ll be milking twenty.”
“Huh!” Old Silas will grunt. “That’s
not much of a change to get married for,
girl. You could get plenty of milking at
home when you were single.”
“But we’ll be milking for ourselves now,
Papa,” Josie’ll laugh, while you’ll add a
few confirmatory nods and grins.
“Yes, yes; quite so —quite so,” from Old
Silas. Then, remembering his time is short,
that he only snatched an hour to drive over
to see how you were both getting along, and
further expressing his gladness at finding
you both so well and happy and in want of
nothing, he’ll take his departure. But before
stepping into the sulky he’ll consign Josie
again to your care, telling you that “she's
in your hands, and take care of her —take
care of her.”
Then, standing together Avatcliing him
rolling away down the road, you’ll turn to
Josie and drawing her to you, your cheek
to hers, you’ll croon in her ear : “And I am
talcin’ care of you, Josie, ain’t I?”
SQUARING THE CIRCLE.
PEG (newly engaged) : “Ah, what a wonderful thing is love—it makes the whole world
go round!”
MEG ( married, and knows all about it): “Yes, and it takes quite a lot of alimony
to square things afterwards.”
The honeymoon will be fading out, and
you’ll be back in harness again. But you’re
beginning to find you’re a different man
now. Life has become more serious to
you ; you’re an independent person, in your
own eyes and in the eyes of .Tosie’s friends
who come to see her. You’ll realise how
quickly a young wife can raise her husband
in the esteem of others, and how he can
convince himself that it's all due to his
own merits.
So the months go by. You’ve reaped a
good harvest and waved your first sheaf.
You’re finding it’s almost as cheap for two
to live as it is for one. Yet, as much as
you love each other and pull evenly together,
the same constant, self-contained, unvarying
society somehow palls. There is something
lacking. You don’t quite understand what
it is. Not being an artist or painter of
realism, your mind won’t dwell on creative
effort or the imitating of nature as a solu-
tion.
Still you’ll be making the most you can
of everything, and doing your best to make
life pleasant and prosperous and easy for
Josie. She'll be doing her best, too, to help—
cooking, making, mending, saving and com-
forting. And she’ll become engaged in sowing
and cutting out a new sort of clothes and
things from patterns lent her by Mrs. Eadv
and Mrs. Boody on the next homesteads. This
will seem jo fie special work she has under-
taken which you won't be informed about
until one day she'll startle you by com-
plaining of not being well, and telling you
to go at once for her friend Mrs. Gamp.
Gripes! You’ll turn pale. Then you'll
think of the horse and sulky, and lialf-
bewildered you’ll run for the winkers. All
the poetry will go out of married life for you
as you leave Josie alone and rush up the
paddock to catch Snip. As bad luck will
have it, there’s not an animal within call
of the yard—they are all up on the ridge!
And just when you locate Snip, after
running, blundering and puffing till you’re
fit to drop, it will suddenly dawn on you
that he won’t let anyone but Josie catch
him in the paddock. What are you going
to do? Being one of the cunning ones he
won’t submit to being yarded on foot! So
you’ll approach him down-heartedly, coaxing,
wheedling, grovelling to him. But all your
efforts will be useless, for he’ll calmly look
at you, and, cocking his tail in disrespect,
will trot off out of reach.
Then an idea will come to you in your
desperation. You’ll run back to the house
to put on a dress and hat of Josie’s and
return to Snip. You’ve put them on and
have come out of the house again, when —
salvation! the voice of your father-in-law
greets you! You’ll stop, surprised. So will
he. “What in God’s name, man, are you
dressed up like that for?’’ he will ask. “Are
you demented?”
When you gasp out everything to him.
he’ll become more alarmed and concerned
than you. “Here, man,” he will choke,
jumping to the ground, “get into my sulky,
and go for your life—go for your life! You
should have had your own horse harnessed
and ready every night and every day!”
Next minute you’ll be flogging your way
along the wide lane at breakneck pace to
Mrs). Gamp’s, while Old Silas will hobble
back home on foot, grunting and mumbling
at every turn: “Twas no place for a man
to find himself at such a time—at such a
time! Young fools ! They will get married
—will get married !”
STEELE RUDD.
Dead Treasure.
[FOR THE BULLTIN.]
ẅ
“Well, you ’ardly ever ’ave,” mischievously
grunted someone from the soggy folds of a
sweater half over his head.
“Py Gott, ain't you goin’ to fight ’com
for tat?”
The astonished ejaculation rose above the
laughter.
“ ’Old yer mouth, Square’cad !”
“I fight you, t’en, by Yimminy !”
“Aw, caulk ’is mouf wiv a fender,
someone !”
“Shut the row, the lot o’ you. You’ll
wake ole Tarby ’ere.”
There was an apologetic murmur. A sea-
man, half out of his wet jersey, wriggled
back into it and reached
down the lamp while the
rest of the watch crowded
curiously behind as he
held it over the still form
of a sailor wrapped
warmly in his bunk.
In the unsteady yellow
light his gnarled old face,
bristled greyly with a
long unbarbered beard,
had about it the startling
unreality of some ju-ju
man’s mahogany mask.
By some trick of the
shadows the sunken
cheeks appeared mere
formless cavities and the
eyes were momentarily
invisible in the black
craters of their sockets.
“Looks bad, don’t ’e?”
“We’ll be feeding ’im
to the fish soon, I’m
thinking.”
“To the fish?” It was
a weighty bass voice of
extraordinary power and
resonance that, from the
gloom of the sick man’s
bunk. countered these
observations.
The suddenness and
the unexpected strength
of it made them all
jump.
“To the fish?” repeated the enormous
voice. It laughed cavernously. “I’ll go to
no fish’s belly. Straight to Davy Jones him-
self I go, feet-first and ship-shape!”
There was a pause as the watch, guiltily
conscious of having bespoken a sick man’s
death in his hearing, waited.
“Yes ! To Davy in his deep-sea kingdom
of vanished ships and the mariners who
manned ’em. Davy’s just been here !”
In the awed silence that followed, the
Squarehead’s hushed “Py Gott!” seemed to
echo back from every stuffy corner of the
dank fo’c’s’le.
To them all the ancient, massive Tarby
had been something of a mystery and a
curiosity. In the beginning he had come
aboard as a man of “laming” and of books,
and had always remained beyond their com-
prehension. Secretly they suspected that
long ago he had sailed abaft the mizzen.
One or two of the more imaginative had
ventured the belief that he had indeed held
a master’s berth in his own ship, and privily
they advanced certain reasons, intelligible
only to sailormen, in support of the
theory.
Now that he had claimed a death-bed
acquaintance with Davy Jones they listened
to his heavy breathing with an enlivened
and deeply superstitious respect. And
though the timbre of that heavy voice yet
echoed in their ears, they jumped in unison
as it spoke again.
“Where arc you, Davy? Where’s he
gone? I saw him standing here again just
now —liis green beard all wet and soft, with
wrack right down to his big bare knees;
and his long hair-like kelp, wet and waving
too, as if -washed by all the endless tides
and currents of the seas. On his ears
dangled big sea-sliells that swayed when he
tallied to me, and when he talked he smiled
while water trickled fast out of his round
green eyes and down his green beard to his
bony, mighty feet!”
“Somethin's carried away alawft wiv ’im.
He’s gorn loco!” a listener whispered hus-
kily, and caught his breath as the abnormal
voice an instant later vibrated thunderously
in a roar of mocking laughter.
“Who says an unkindness of old Davy?”
demanded Tarby. “Why, as I looked upon
his salty figure there, I could see... .1 could
see—yes, we were all there, fathoms down
on the sea-floor. All of us!
“And the weights they buried with us
still shackled our feet as we stood upright
among weird flowering weeds, pulpy sponges
and stranger vines and grasses than ever
living eyes beheld ! All of us there in the
filmy green and all swaying slowly to the
strains of a soundless orchestra!
“And piled there, masthead high, were
all the towering hulks of broken ships as in
and out of their sundered sides swam strange
sentinel fishes with shining, steady eyes!”
The deep voice softened away to a drowsy
murmur, broken again by a great barking
cough which, ending in a throaty gurgle,
presaged the close approach of the Chief
Actor in this little drama of a ship’s
fo’c’s’le.
“ ’E’s goin’ any jiffy now,” whispered
one of the older hands. “Better call the Ole
Man in.”
Someone dived out into the gusty night
and in a few minutes returned. In his wake
came the skipper.
“Does he want me?” the skipper asked.
“ ’E ’asn’t so far said so, sir.” the spokes-
man of the watch replied. “But we was
thinkin’ of that there mysteryus box o’ his.
Wouldn’t let no one lay a ’and on it, ’e
wouldn’t, sir, an’ ’e ! s got it stowed tight
in ’is bunk there with him —’olding onner
it like as if it ’ad ’is soul an’ fortune locked
’ard an’ fast inside it.”
His watch-mates nodded their heads in
mute testimony.
The skipper turned to the sick man, whose
bright eyes regarded him steadily from the
depths of their cavernous sockets.
“How d’ye feel, Tarby, man?” he in-
quired kindly.
“Homeward bound. I am, sir,” rumbled
the dying mariner’s failing voice. “And no
regrets, sir... .none.”
“Buck up, man! Take a haul on your
slack. You’ll be all right again soon !”
The captain was conscious of his too ob-
vious assumption of hope and cheer even
as he uttered it, and Tarby laughed.
“A sick man’s end is plain and fair for
him to see when it heaves-to abeam his
bunk, sir. And, as I’ve told ’em, Davy’s been
MORE TO HIS SIZE.
“You got the leeches I sent for your husband, Mrs. Trevithick?”
“Iss, I did. But what were the good o’ sending they little things jor a girt big man
like ’e? Why, I just took an’ clapped a ferret on ’e.”
here and is ready and willing to take me
aboard o’ him.”
“The men ask about your box, Tarby.
What do you want done with it?”
The sick man groped weakly for some-
thing under his blankets, and in the momen-
tary and expectant silence the fo’c’s’le
drummed as its converging walls rolled,
lifted, reared and plunged in ecstatic liar-
mony with the weighty, rising seas of the
night.
Yellowly the lamplight danced across the
faces of the assembly in grotesque rhythm
with the eerie creaks and groans of straining
timbers. Aloft, outside, the wind harped
grandly on halyard, brace and stay. As the
crew, at a respectful distance, peered over
their skipper's shoulder, old Tarby drew to
view an ancient lacquered casket, curiously
worked in inlaid silver and about the siz-e
of a cigar-box.
As the captain’s eyes contemplated it they
dilated strangely.
“God!” he cried, and to the wondering
and astonished men it seemed he made to
snatch the casket from Tarby’s skinny
hands 1 .
As he checked himself in the very genesis
of the impulse, he staggered and slipped on
the lurching floor, and would have fallen
had not ready hands reached out to him.
He shook them from him and sprang out
on to the deck.
“I must be sure! I must be sure!” He
muttered the words huskily to himself as
he strode rapidly up the waist of the ship.
“It can't be the man after all these years!
But if it is!”
He halted abruptly, took rein on his
emotions, and, with a glance aloft, hastened
back to the fo’c’s'le, llis voice was steady,
but his eyes were bright and feverish as he
faced his amazed men.
“I thought I heard one of the t’gallants
go,” he lied.
lie turned eagerly to Tarby.
“Your box, man!”
But Tarby’s eyes were fixed, apparently
objectlessly, on the foot of his bunk.
“Joe,” his voice mumbled dreamily.
“I’m ’ere, old son,” .Toe answered.
“Davy’s standing by to con the way below.
When they slip me over, hail him, that he
may know I’m following close on his course.”
“I prornise yer, matey,” said Joe.
There was a brief silence. The sick man
coughed again, and....
A little later the skipper, holding Tarby’s
casket in trembling hands, went aft to his
cabin. On the way he passed the sailmaker,
with needles, twine and a bolt of canvas,
making forward to do his grisly job in the
fo’c’s’le.
Early next morning they dropped a canvas-
wrapped bundle to a deep, green grave, but
it was the mate who read the service.
“Ton’t fergit, Yoe," said the Squarehead.
“Aw, it won’t make no diff’rence!” Joe
protested, self-conscious and abashed. “E'd
gorn barmy!”
“Yell, I vill t’en!” cried the Squarehead
indignantly. He stepped to the rail. “Tafy
Yones, ahoy!” he yelled. “Ve yust tropped
’eem over!” He turned to Joe again. “Now,
you break-vord, you ! Ter fecsts now—put
’em oop!”
The ensuing sounds of strife were unheard
by the captain. Locked in his cabin aft, his
head propped in weather-marked hands, he
stared with troubled eyes at a mass of black
and glossy hair.
Half-hidden in the long tresses coiled in
a tangled heap upon the table was a minia-
ture, framed in yellowed ivory, of a woman
of erotic and compelling beauty.
Open near by was the ancient casket.
After a long time the captain bestirred
himself.
He packed the hair back in the casket and
placed the miniature on top of it. Then he
closed and locked the box, took it to a port-
hole and filing it forth unto the leaping grey
wastes of the sea.
“I suppose,” he reflected bitterly—“l sup-
pose if she loved him enough to leave me
she wasn’t really mine. She was his.”
The skipper poured himself a drink, but he
did not recorlc the bottle, and was not seen
on deck for three days.
“Cap’n’s got a touch o’ the fever,” the
mate considerately explained to the ship.
The crew nodded, but refrained from com-
ment. They already had their own explana-
tioa' e , volv ! d tlle privacy of the , ir garters,

Nsw Chrysler “65” 4'Door Saloon
Now Comes an Utterly New
Motor Car Style
The woman who
owns one of the new
Chryslers—“6s” or
“75”—has the satisfac-
tion of knowing that
in addition to posses-
sing the utmost in
brilliant, smooth and
safe performance, she
also possesses, beyond
any doubt, the very
last word in style.
For these new Chry-
slers are so definitely
different in their advanced
conception of motor car
fashion that there is noth-
ing on the road today
which compares with
them or which resembles
them.
Elements of motor car
design and appearance
which apparently were
rimer
considered fix ed
forms not susceptible
to any change, have
been transformed by
Chrysler into utterly
new and charming
details.
A telephone call to
your nearest Chrysler
dealer will place one of
these cars at your door
for inspection and de-
monstration, without
any obligation to you.

BEYOND HOPE.
“Does the Editor of the Gadget accept, much of your stuff?”
“Accept much! Why, that man wouldn’t accept the Inevitable!”
offended. And you’ve been doing that sort
h J“?? ever Smce? 1 mean writing poetry
aoout it. \ ...
Poet: Not altogether One cannot live by
poesy alone, unless he is subsidised by a
patent-medicine proprietor; but some of
the less-elusive shadows are to be found
in a small volume of my own verses that
I ve published as a modest bid for recog-
mtiou.
Banker : I know. You sent me a presents-
tion copy. Very kind of you. It’s on
my library shelves; but I must say it looks
very slender and ummposmg alongside the
twenty-four Annual Reports of the
Bankers Institute.
Composer (to Poet) : There’s your oppor-
tunit-y now. Why not put the Reports of
the Bankers Institute into verse, and so
gain recognition and a reading public at
once?
Poet : Peace, noise merchant! Back to your
organ and monkey!
Banker: And was the publication a success?
Poet (modestly) : That is for my readers to
say.
Banker : I mean financially, of course.
Poet : The presentation copies to my friends
and the critics, absorbed most of the
edition. Recognition of Art comes slowly
—painfully so —while Fame seems a mist
on the mountains.
Banker: I—l suppose that little volume
doesn’t represent your total production as
a poet?
Poet : Oh no. That was only a selection.
The. rest is embalmed in numerous peri-
odicals ; but I’ve also published a small
anthology.
Banker: Eh? Wlmt’s that?
Poet : A collection of verse by selected
authors—often relating, as mine did, to one
subject. I called . mine “The Anthology
of Passion.”
Banker: With the same result—financially?
Poet: Much the same.
Banker: Well. well. We won’t be severe
about your limited production. I suppose
the market for that sort of thing is a hole-
and-corner affair.
Poet : Well, I’m generally in one or the
other, but I haven’t noticed the market.
Banker : And you, Clifton. How has the
world treated your pursuit of your—er—
art?
Composer : Not any more kindly, but I stick
to my musical guns—and other noises—
until my merits (if there are any) as a
composer are admitted.
Banker: But who is supposed to admit
these claims of yourself and Warland?
Composer: The discriminating few.
Poet: The intellectual minority.
Banker: Oh, that’s ridiculous! Supposing
I had opened my counting-house for busi-
ness with “the discriminating few,” where
should I have been by now? Keeping
banking accounts for the, amateur art
societies and the repertory theatres! Cash-
ing post-dated cheques for the intellectual
minority ! I can see myself doing it!
Poet : I wish I could !
Banker: But you also (addressing the Com-
poser) have made some sort of effort at
“recognition,” as you call it, haven’t you?
I remember that symphony of yours being
produced here a year ago—what was it
called?
Composer : “The Vision of Saint Anthony.”
Banker : Yes ; you wrote to me about it;
and I took seats and sent the family along.
Produced by a philharmonic society, I re-
member. I fancy it—er—didn’t run long?
Composer : One consecutive performance;
but “the discriminating few” (which in-
cluded your family, of course) received it
very well.
Banker ( yawning ) : Ah, 1 daresay. I sup-
pose that has not been the sum of your
musical achievements?
Composer : Composers also must live. I
have perpetrated other things, even songs
and dances for the variety stage, but I
don’t say much about those. Neither do
the critics whose opinions count. Some-
times, for my sins, I have been punished
with pupils. (Shudders.)
Poet : And so contributed your little bit
towards the sum of social misery.
Banker : Ha, ha! I know that’s not very
remunerative, but tell me now—about
those compositions for the variety theatres.
How do they pay you for that sort of
thing?
Composer: Just at present one particular
manager considers me grasping because
I’m sticking out for ten pounds for a song.
Banker: Dear me! Is that all you get out
of it?
Composer : I retain the copyright, for what
it is worth, but I assure you that after the
vaudevillains have once heard the song and
taken a fancy to it the copyright isn’t a
very valuable asset. But I get credit for
the composition.
Banker: In what way’
Composer: My name is mentioned on the
programme alongside the tradesmen who
supply the furniture costumes
Banker; Tla. ha! Well, well' Yon both
astonish me. To think that you should
call that sort of thing the Pursuit of Art'
What has it done for either of vou’ T
don’t want to boast, hut I began when
you did. I was practical. I went into a
bank and learnt all the essentials of the
business. When my father’s fortune came
my way I invested it all in the bank which
I now practically own. I gave mvself m
wholly to the business—the only wav to
succeed—and success came and - kent ro-
peating itself. Nothing succeeds like
success, you know. That’s one of the
open secrets of finance. I married, and my
wife’s money went into it, too. The snow-
ball grew 7. Our last balance-sheet w 7 as
phenomenal. Our funds have passed the
million mark.
Poet : A million ! Think of that, Clifton.
Composer: I can’t. Ten pounds is the limit
of my imagination.
Banker : Anyone may know it. We don’t
omit to publish it. The more you can
show the public huge figures in your
accounts, the more they want to do busi-
ness with you.
Poet : As Wilde says, “Nothing succeeds like
excess.”
Composer : And success has followed you in
other ways—socially—domestically ?
CRYING NEED FOR REFORM.
REBECCA: “Yes, I think, Rachel, we ought to be making better use of our young
men.”
RACHEL: “Indeed, yes, Rebecca. From where I sit I can see they’re all running to
waist.”
Banker : Certainly. I married, as I told
you. I have a son and daughter, just
grown up. My son will follow me in the
bank —that is, he will take the chairman-
ship in due course. I am looking forward
to his marriage with the daughter of a
fellow-financier, and if this comes off we
may have two of the biggest banking
houses in the city amalgamated, with a
capital that will leave my present re-
sources in the shadow, and possibilities we
don’t ’yet estimate.
Poet : Amazing! And your son’s suitable
marriage would do all that?
Banker : I hope so.
Poet : And your daughter—may one expect
an equally romantic marriage for her?
Banker : There you touch on what is the
secret ambition—not an unreasonable
ambition, I am sure—of my wife and
myself. My daughter has made the
acquaintance of Sir Stephen Stonyfell, an
English baronet, who, I am proud to say,
is prepared to offer her his hand and
hereditary title.
Composer : And will he also bring large
financial resources to the help of your
banking-house?
Banker : Not a penny! In fact, his debts
are rather a scandal; but that doesn’t
concern us greatly. There is no doubt
whatever of his social standing, and the
baronetcy is one of the oldest in the British
Empire. I shall be able to give my daugh-
ter a settlement sufficient to enable them
to pay off the mortgages and re-establish
themselves.
Poet- That will be very munificent of you.
You will share in the reflected glory, I
hope?
Banker ( confidentially) : Well, I don’t mind
confessing that when it seems—er —an
opportune time, I think of buying an estate
in England. Lots of them to be had for
a song, you know. Sir Stephen and Ladv
Stonyfell will be able to secure us the
entree into the best English society. By
the way, he is here to-day. I ( want you
both to meet him.
Poet : Thanks. Do his tastes incline at all
to literature?
Composer : Or music ?
Banker : Neither, I should say. The turf
is his hobby. Horses—racehorses. He
even suggests my buying one or two and
taking up racing by way of recreation.
(The Banker’s Son and Daughter enter
together. They also are dressed for tennis. )
Ah. well-arrived, children! You haven’t
met .my old friends Mr. Warland and Mr.
Clifton. ( Mutual greetings. The Daughter
looks at the Poet in a sort of rapture.
The Son does likewise at the Composer.)
Daughter (in an awed voice) : Are you Mr.
Jasper Warland, the famous poet?
Poet (to Daughter) : It’s kind of you to
express it that way, but you flatter me
unduly.
They retire a little, conversing.
Son (to Composer) : Are you really the
Clement Clifton who composes that won-
derful music?
Composer: I’m not sure, but I hope I’m
the one you mean.
Banker (to Daughter) : Now. my dear,
what have you done with Sir Stephen?
daughter: Oh, mother's looking after him.
Banker : But I don’t fancy he came for
the benefit of your mother’s society!
Daughter: She’s welcome to it, anyway.
I’ll stay here with Mr. Warland, if it's
all the same.
Banker : Well, come and join us soon. Don’t
forget. Come along, Bob. Come, Clifton.
I’m afraid Sir Stephen will be finding it
a little dull.
The Banker , the Composer and the Son go
out.
Poet (to Daughter) : What made you call
me “the famous poet”? I’m not, you
know; though I hope to be —some day.
Daughter: But I think you are—T mean
you ought to be. I think your verses are
beautiful!
Poet : Thank you. That is very gratifying.
Which of my verses do you like best?
Daughter : Those you call “The Ode of the
Undeclared Dover.”
Poet : Oh yes, the one beginning:
“Under yon beech-tree, single on the green-sward,
Couched with her arms behind her golden head,
Knees and tresses twisted”
No, no!
“Knees and hair entwined”
No, that’s wrong.
Daughter :
“Knees and tresses folded to slip and ripple idly,
Lies my young love, sleeping in the shade.”
Poet : Yes, yes. Go on!
Daughter :
“Had I the heart to slip an arm beneath, her,
Press her parting lips as her waist I gather slow;
Waking in amazement, she could not but embrace me.
Then would she hold me and never let me go.”
Poet: Why, you seem to know it by heart!
Daughter: Every word of it!
Poet : I had no idea my verse could make
such an appeal. I am really flattered.
What has impressed it on your memory
like that?
Daughter (embarrassed) : Oh, it expresses
things so beautifully. I mean, it touches
one’s own feelings—it
Poet: It has made a personal appeal to you,
for some reason. May Ibe taken into
your confidence? Was it just reafding the
poem over?
Daughter : Oh no! I’ve never read it.
(The Daughter is covered with confusion.)
If I tell you something will you swear
by all that’s holy never to repeat it? .
Poet ( holding up a. hand and in a solemn
voice) : ’Tis deeply sworn!
Daughter : Then, I know your poetry so
well because a man —a gentleman—a
friend I know—has often read it to me,
and to hear him read or recite it —oh, it’s
wonderful!
Poet : You don’t by any chance mean Sir
Stephen?
Daughter ( aghast ) : That—that clown ! He
couldn’t recite “God Save the King.”
They want me to marry him, I know, but
I won’t. I won’t! That’s flat, ariff I don’t
care who knows it!
Poet: Still, no one must be told anything!
Then who is the young gentleman who
specialises in my verses?
Daughter : He’s only a clerk in Father’s
bank —just a junior clerk -with a shame-
fully small salary, but —yes, he loves me
and I love him; and as for anyone else
it wouldn’t matter if he were a duke
or
Poet : And how did he come to make such
a charming conquest?
Daughter: It was your poetry that did it.
Poet : Nonsense!
Daughter: Yes; until he read to me the
“Ode of the Undeclared Lover” I never
knew 7 what poetry and love w r ere. I never
realised that they could be united in the
same man. And Harold writes poetry
himself.
Poet : Poor wretch!
Daughter: He’ll be famous too. some day.

Poet : Well, lie’s making a good beginning.
And do you really mean to sacrifice every-
thing for him?
Daughter : Everything! If Father won’t
consent, we mean to
Poet : Ilush! No more confidences, please.
But don’t you think you may be acting a
little indiscreetly? What you contem-
plate you must see is quite contrary to
your parents’ wishes.
Daughter: Do you mean to say that you—
you—advocate my making a sordid mar-
riage for a title?
Poet: Oh, 1 don’t go as far as that, but
you ought not to he precipitate. Your
parents should be consulted and all that,
and your own emotions carefully reviewed.
Daughter : Well I am surprised! To hear
that from you — you who could write* those
lovely lines:
“All thoughts, all passions, all delights,
Whatever stirs this mortal frame,
All are hut ministers of Love,
And feed his sacred flame.”
Poet : But those lines are not mine. They’re
Coleridge’s.
Daughter : Well, Harold read them to me
out of that book of yours.
Poet : Yes, my, anthology. They’re in that.
Daughter: I’m sure you could have writ-
ten them if you’d liked.
Poet (to the gods) : This is indeed my Day
of Recognition! Unfortunately Coleridge
got there first. But I am to be intro-
duced to Sir Stephen. Shall we go?
Daughter: All right, but don’t ask me to
do it. And remember, not a word to
Father!
' The Poet puts a finger to his Tips and they
go out. The Composer and the Son enter
from the other side. The Son is greatly
amused about something.
Son : .. . .and when I sent in a fast one on
the backhand he fell down and complained
that it wasn’t fair.
Composer : You were rather merciless.
Son : Well, I’ve left Dad to finish the game.
He’ll spoonfeed the little bounder.
Composer : But lie’s your prospective
brother-in-law.
Son : And he’s a bore. It’s tedious always
talking horse to him, but the fellow’s so
ignorant about art, music and all that.
Why lie says lie’s never seen Dulcie Dol-
cetto !
Composer: Dulcie Dolcetto? Oh yes; the
dancer in the revue at the Terpsichore
Theatre. Still, that’s pardonable.
Son : Why, she dances to your music!
Composer : Yes, that’s how I come to know
of her.
Son : And lie declares he’s never heard of
your music.
Composer : Oh, that’s inexcusable! But you
seem to admire my music.
Son : It’s glorious.
Composer: Thanks. You have musical
taste, I see.
Son : I can’t say I’m foiid of all music.
I’ve no time for that highbrow stuff.
Last winter Dad took a lot of tickets
and insisted on my going to hear a tiling
they called a Symphony.
Composer (slowly rising in his chair) :
Do you happen to remember the name of
it?
UNEMPLOYED—FOR THE MOMENT.
Son : Somebody’s Vision, I think. It was
well named. It just about sent me to
by-bye.
Composer (sadly) : “The Vision of Saint
Anthony,” Symphonic Poem in four
episodes, fully orchestral.
Son : Yes; you seem to know it.
Composer: Quite familiarly But if that
palled on you, what was it of mine that
took your fancy so greatly?
Son : The music of that dance of Dulcie
Dolcetto’s in “Chase Me, Girls!” “The
Dance- of the Breezes,” you called it. I
never heard anything like it. It’s an
inspiration ! And until I saw Dulcie dance
to it I never knew how beautiful she was.
Composer: You had seen her before, I sup-
pose?
Son : Lots of times, but that music seemed
to make all the difference.
Composer : She danced it very nicely.
Son : Nicely! It was floating poetry! Your
“Dance of the Breezes” ought to make
your name with people who know anything
about music.
Composer : Well, it didn’t send you to sleep,
anyway. Pardon my asking it, have you
made the personal acquaintance of Miss
Doleetto ?
Son : I didn’t know her before that dance,
but after that I simply had to
Composer : That induced you to——
Son : I say, you seem a sport. If I tell
you something, you won't give me away?
Composer : Trust me !
Son : Well, I met Dulcie all right, and we
fell in love with one another almost at
sight.
Composer: That’s very sudden, but not
unprecedented. And how far has the
romance gone?
Son: It will go on for ever!
Composer : Though men may come and men
may go. Then you really think of marry-
ing her?
Son ( looking round cautiously) : I have
married her.
Composer : What!
Son : A week ago, at a registry
office. Father and Mother don’t
know anything about it yet. Ot
course, there’ll be a devil of a
row when they do, but I don’t
care. Dulcie and I mean to
stand up to it.
Composer: But won’t this upset
all your father’s projects— all
his schemes for your welfare?
Son :' My welfare !
Composer: Well, the family for-
tunes and aspirations.
Son : Confound the aspirations!
We mean to be happy in our
own way.
Composer; Your father looks for-
ward, you know, to big financial
organisation with your help—
the expansion of the bank—
Son : Damn the bank ! Dulcie and
I want to enjoy our lives.
Composer : I hope you may. If
I’d known in time I should have
been happy to compose a wedding march.
But I hear your father coming.
The Banker and the Poet enter from, the
lawn. The Banker is flushed with exercise.
Banker : I’m afraid Sir Stephen doesn’t
play much of a game. I had a hard job
to let him win that from me. By the way,
Bob, you’d better go out and help to
entertain him. ( The Son goes out.) That
game has warmed me up and made me
thirsty. ( lie goes to the punch-howl.)
.Join me again, you two. ( They assent
arid he fills the glasses.) I didn’t ask
cither of you to play tennis. I notice
you didn’t seem to come prepared. ( To
Poet) You haven’t brought shoes with
you, I suppose?
Poet : I—er—couldn’t find mine.
Banker: Nor you, Clifton?
Composer : I haven’t got any.
Banker : Ha, ha! I suppose that’s part of
the improvidence of an artistic career.
Confirms my view of the futility of it.
It prepares you for nothing. Now, without
wishing to assert any superiority, I can
say that my financial career has prepared
me for everything. I’ve the means to
gratify any taste or hobby and create a
good impression with my friends, not
to speak of looking forward to higher
ambitions, as I hinted to you before.
Frankly it’s the power of money—let us
call it Finance —“money” sounds rather
vulgar.

Poet and Composer: My dear
Banker: No, no ! No thanks. You’re very
welcome.
He goes out.
Poet ( sadly reflective) : What has our art

poor clerk!
Composer : And my music has induced his

what it has done for him! Come, another
toast. - To “Triumphant Art !”
They raise glasses and drink.

There was old harness on a dozen pegs,
an( i’ after lighting his pipe, he sat down
on a stool and started to rub away at a
set lying at his feet
“Have to keep things tidied up,” he spoke.
and th , en was silea t. I saw that now he had
a boy’s saddle on his knees; and when he
looked up his eyes were brimming with tears
and his lips trembled
What secret of the old man’s life lay in
these scraps of leather. I wondered.'
“That’s a nice little saddle,” I ventured,
The old man ceased work to light his pipe
again. Then he leaned back against the
w r al]. “My son’s,”.he whispered.
We sat on again without a word, till he
looked up swiftly, a frightened expression
lighting his eyes as he gazed past me
through the Avindow behind us. Scrambling
to his feet he pulled the shutter down; but
I caught a glimpse of his old wife slowly
winding her way to feed the fowls in the
yard beyond the house.
The old man regained his seat Avith a low
murmur of sorrow. For a moment he re-
mained gazing motionless at the 1 harness
as if he was contemplating the extent of
necessary repairs.
“He was almost a man when it happened,”
he went on. “One day he rode up in those
hills looking for cattle that had strayed.
All that day he was gone. Dusk came and
still he had not returned. Just at dark
his pony came home. A stirrup was missing.
Early next morning I found him up there,
lying stiff and cold, with the missing stirrup
on his foot. ■ I had to leave him there, for
I knew that if I brought him home it would
kill his mother. Poor old mother, how she
loved that boy! And she still flunks he
will come home some day. He always had
a longing to see the world over the hills,
and she tells me almost every day that he
is living over there. And I tell her that he
is....just to keep her spirits up. But she
will never see even his grave, for the night
I Avas to have returned to bury him a bush-
fire swept the mountains where he lay.”
A km coo-ee came from the house.
“That’s mother calling you to have a cup
of tea,” he said.
He lit his pipe again, and settled back
to his work. I walked away to the house.
*** , *
“And I suppose father told you about our
boy?” said the old woman as we sat at
our. tea. “Poor old father! He’s still always
saying that , the boy will come home again.
And I tell him yes... .just to keep his spirits
up. But he won’t come home, and I’m
the only one that knows it. I found him
up there in the hills and brought him down
in the night, so that father wouldn’t see him,
and I buried him just round the point, in
the bank of the. creek. Poor old father —it
would kill him if he knew the truth. And
I’ve kept it from him for nigh on forty
years l .”

The National Bank of Australasia, as it stands to-day,
is not a mere counting-house. It is a brain with nerve
centres in every vital part of every country. In spite of
its vastness it is so human that it gladly advises even
the least of its clients on any matter of financial concern.
Knowing how vital it is for women who have never
handled business affairs to receive competent advice on
money questions, it has established a women’s depart-
ment with a special staff of officers.
All this may be in a sense ahead of the times. Australia
could, if it had to, rub along without it. But Australia
can develop more surely, safely and rapidly by virtue
of financial vigilance. Its industries can benefit by the
knowledge of world conditions which flows into “The
National” by cable, radio and mail from every centre of
population. Its residents can gain by the multitudinous
facilities which "The National” proffers
them in connection with their financial
affairs.
Every Australian should know what
help “The National” and other banks can
give him. Every Australian should learn
to use to the full all the specialised
service available for hi 3
assistance.

SECRET
—a secret sixty years old! And
during all that time it has
been bringing vital health to
thousands of people in every
civilized country in the world.
What is this secret? Just this t—
that the inner cleanliness on
which good health depends is
best maintained through the
simple rule —a glass of water
sparkling with a “dash” of Eno
first thing every morning. Gent-
ly and naturally Eno helps the
system to free itself of its daily
waste and keeps your blood-
stream clean and vigorous.
Eno does its work so pleasantly. The
idea that only unpleasant purgative
mineral salts can be good for you has
long been exploded. In this climate
nothing can really take the place of the
morning draught of Eno’s “Fruit -Salt”
with its beneficial * effect upon the
whole system.
