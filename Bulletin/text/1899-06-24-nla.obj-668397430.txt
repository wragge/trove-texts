THE local Muse takes pre-
cedence, so it may as
well be given her. W.
T. Goodge, editor of
Orange (N.S.W.) Leader , who
collects his rhymes under the title
of Hits, Skits, and Jingles,
follows the lady at some consider-
able distance, and esteems him-
self lucky if he now and then
touch a fleeting garment-hem.
But such serious moments are
rare with Mr. Goodge. By tem-
perament and preference he sees
the humourous side of things,
and the fluent verse in which he
describes his visions is often
ingenious and amusing, not in-
frequently crude and common-
place. Mr. Goodge’s later
rhymes show a great improvement on his earlier ;
but there is very little in his book which a popular
audience will not relish, and there is much it
will relish amazingly. Eor example,
That there dorg had got that inseck in the bottle ! ”
Nobody could have presented the incident and
idea more deftly, or with a happier sense of the
Austr.uian vernacular. Hits, Skits, and

newspaper rhymes to date, upwards of 150 pieces

Quite a considerable body of choice verse and
prose testifies to the talent and industry of W. B.
Yeats, who passed hi 3 34th birthday on the
thirteenth of this month. Mr. Yeats's new book
of poems. The Wind Among the Reeds, is full
of zephyrs among the hair. Nearly half of the
o 7 pieces contain references, charming references,
to /long, dim hair,” or “a flutter of flower -like
hair, or
Passion-dimmed eyes and long heavy hair
That was shaken out over my breast,
and other kinds of hair. One goes through the
verses in happy companionship with a pale face
flowed over by billows of blue-black hair—though
there is no warrant for the pale face “where teeth
are white and eyebrows are black . . . cheeks
red like foxgloves in flower.” Mr. Yeats more
than maintains his reputation in this new book.

Occasionally he permits the vagaries of the Celtic

not earn theirplace. Many of them are beautiful,
beautiful in feeling and phrase.

faithless to a constantly faithful woman.” Un-
luckdy, during one of Tullio’s faithless absences,
Uiuliana has one minute of weakness ” —with
H Hippo present—and, as Tullio discovers after-
wards, ' there was no doubt but that she had been
surprised by him in one of those fits of languor,
and had suffered the violation in a Sort of un-
consciousness, awakening out of which, she
had ..realised the irreparable act With horror
and loathing.” Result: when Tullio finds
that his happiness is in Giuliana’s arms, and not
elsewhere, he is called upon (to Giuliana’s horror
also) to welcome F.ilippo’s child as his heir and
son. Guided by some obscure hereditary impulse,
and realising that Giuliana’s happiness and his
own are impossible while the infant lives, he takes
it unperceived from its cradle and exposes it to an

similitude which he gives, “ The Victim ” is less a
wonderful work than a piece of wonderful work-
manship. The high-pitched note begets mono-
tony; the light is always glaring: there are no
cool shadows. This was inevitable; for the fever
of the book represents the fever of the narrator’s
brain. But one is not sorry to get away from the
fever: its ravings are too continuously tragio to
leave the impression of tragedy. (Heincmann;

J* *
R. le Gallienne’s Young Lives is a slight, agree-
able, ephemera? story founded on his own reminis-
cences of youth. The author’s style helps him so
much that one is surprised to meet now and then
sentences like—
Mike and Henry loved eaoh other, it would appear, less
for any correspondences in dispositions or tastes, as just
because they were Mike and Henry, (p. 106.)
A comparison between Le Gallienne and Kipling
is tinctured with the author’s familiar feminine
arrogance. Of some youthful verses reprinted,
here is one that is charming—
This is Angelica,
Fallen from heaven,
Fallen from heaven
Into my arms.
Will you go back again.
Little Angelica,
Back up to heaven
Out of my aims?
“ No,” said Angelica;
“ Here is my heaven,
Sere is my heaven,
Here in your arms.
“ Not out of heaven,
But into my heaven
Here have I fallen,
Here in your arms.”
(Grant Richards; 2s. 6d.)
If the authors of “By Creek and Gully, by
12 Australian writers,” wrote good verse and
stories, one might stifle complaint: as they
have written nothing that is distinguished and a
groat deal that is worse than worthless, I protest
against the lying “ Australian ” label. The editor
of the volume, Lala Fisher, is a lady from Rock-
hampton, Q., who writes sentimental verse which
is occasionally endurable and occasionally Awful •
and she seems to have ransacked Britain for
literary hacks, or “ people that can write a bit, you
know,” who have at some time or other visited
this country—being otherwise no more Australian
than Dreyfus is. Of the sixteen authors repre-
sented only six are recognisably Australian; seven
are English, Irish, Scotch, or other; and three
are unheard-of persons who cannot be identified.
It is one of these latter, a Mr. Frank Richardson
who contributes “ An Incident Out West
“ What, in God’? name, made you attempt..to cross ?”
There are five mcfre'tunity-tuiiity stanzas like this
and the works of the other “ Australian writers ”
are more or less like unto thcjin. It is' fair to say
that there is nothing else quite so bad*; and the
contributions by Mrs. Campbell-Praed, Louis
Beeke, E. W. Hornung, and Mrs. Caffyn, though
by no means on the level of their best work, are
up to the .lower magazine-standard of literature
Ihe remainder ranges from tolerable to abject • -
and editor and publisher (apart from the libel on
Australia) have good reason to be ashamed of
themselves. (Fisher Unwin; 2s. 6d.)

DALEY’S DORG WATTLE.
“ You can talk about yer sheep dorgs,” said the man
from Allan’s Creek,
But I know a dorg that simply knocked ’em bandy !
Do whatever you would show him, and you’d hardly need
to speak.
Owned by Daley, drover cove in Jackandandy.
“We was talkin’ in the parlor, me and Daley, quiet like,
When a blow-fly starts a-buzzin’ round the ceilin’,
Up gets Daley, and he says to me, You wait a minute,
Mike,
And I ’ll show you what a dorg he is at heelin’.
“ And an empty pickle-bottle was a-standin’ on the
shelf,
Daley takes it down and puts it on the table,
And he bets me drinks that blinded dorg would do it by
himself—
And I didn’t think as how as he was able.
“ Well, he shows the dorg the bottle, and he points up to
the fly,
And he shuts the door, and says to him—‘ Now, Wattle 1
And in less than fifteen seconds, spare me days, it ain’t a
lie,
The wind is sighing drearily through the trees
A the boundary rider makes' his daily round,
And by the waning light he dimly sees
A human form stretched out upon the ground.
The face gleamed pale arid haggard as with pain,
The tongue was lolling swollen, dry and red,
He must have crossed full forty miles of plain,
His eyes were almost starting from his head.
The rider gave him water from his bag,
He rubbed his joints to take the stiffness out;
And lifting him h? put him on'the nag,
And walking by bis side they both set out.
’Twas nightfall when they reached the lonely camp,
, And after he had hobbled out his horse,
The rider said, while lighting his slush lamp,
A VOLUNTARY.
Words are but fragments of unuttered thought,
Songs are but words kissing each other’s lips,
Music love’s footsteps as along she trips ;
Love is life’s balm, from Heaven to each one brought,
Life, but a breath, so soon by Death upcaught.
And back across the Night to God it slips.
Artists in Australia .
111.-SID LONG.
TI IS friends say Sid Long is an “ impression -
1 9. ist artist because his ideals dwell in that
imaginative borderland which can no more be
exactly depicted than an angel or an abstract
quality. Angels and abstract qualities are all
your fancy paints them—and more; but when
you give them crude corporeal shape, with a
digestive apparatus and buttons on their boots,
they are less than nothing. No pigment can
create a figment. The painter’s art, when em-
ployed in the realm of imagination, is not to
oreate, but to hint, to suggest. Your own sense
of Beauty must save you : he is merely Beauty’s
John the Baptist, preparing her way and making
her path straight. It is in order to complete the
analogy that the painter wears his hair long, and
occasionally lives on locusts and wild honey—or
bananas.
His enemies say Sid Long is an “ impressionist”
artist because he cannot draw well enough to be
otherwise. It is much easier to affirm that a
yellow snake and a blue splash are the embodi-
ment of Beauty than to fully image Beauty in her
essential shape, with no jot or tittle omitted from
her miracles of colour and contour. If the test of
good Art be the number of things'it leaves to the
imagination, then a blank canvas is the finest
painting; for it leaves everything to the imagina-
tion : there is not one blot or scratch to prevent
you from embracing the flying-Ideal.
I say that, if Sid Long is an “impressionist”
artist, the angel he drew for the last number of
the Australian Magazine is an uncommonly solid
angel, leaving as little to the artistic imagination
as any mundane petticoat-bearer.
Sid Long says he isn’t an “impressionist”
artist.
& &
Then what is Sid Long? An Australian, to
begin with—born at Goulburn, N.S.W., on 15th
November, 1872. And he has never been out ol
S-W.-nwer farther into N.S.W. : his “Spirit
ot the Plains is a factitious picture, a tour de
fantaisie / At 26 he is still young ; but he was
younger wh.en he came to Sydney, where he spent
Six years, as a shipping-clerk, adding up figures
and chasing Beauty all over the blotting-paper
Then, about 1893, he added up his last sum (the
addition was wrong, by the way), pocketed the
ashes-of his burnt slops, and was justified of his
patronymic. ‘ 1 Art is Long. ”
Now Mr. Long studies, paints, takes pupils—
toujours pupils ! The supply seems inexhaustible
—bid Long estimates that there are seven thou-
sand young people in Sydney painfully pottering
with palettes. The yearning for Art in the small
suburban home cannot be quenched. It begins
says Mr. Long, with the birth of Lister Julian
Jones, m the small suburban home. The ecstatic
father turns his eyes to a chromo of Windsor
Lastle above the bedroom mantelpiece, and
suggests affectionately “How nice it would be
if It could paint like that! ” With the mingling
smiles of suburban domesticity Lister Julian’s
destiny is sealed. He is taken to wail at the Art
Gallery before he can walk ; and at ten he com-
mences “ drawing from copies ” with Mrs. Blank
or Miss Dash. It is a proud day; and during the
succeeding hours of darkness the Joneses dream
happily in the glow of the proud night-light from
Windsor Castle.” In three years time or
f/aybe five, the copy is finished ; and a ’new
Windsor Castle” startles visitors to the subur-
ban drawing-room. It glares with an unnatural
brilliance, and the castle is in the river ; but it is
a Painting ; and alone Lister Julian did it.
Luckily for the Drapery, his artistic career stops
short at “ Windsor Castle.” Luckily for Art, at
that precise moment the intoxicated father of
Rosa Bonheur Brown is bending over his wife
A BOOKPLATE.

with an outstretched finger pointing at a coloured
libel on “ The Charge of the Old Guard at Water-
loo.” “How nice if It could learn to paint like
that! ” And Rosa Boniieur’s potato is cooked.
Of the seven thousand pupils of Sydney, says
Mr. Long, perhaps six thousand begin and end
with copying a chromo. They go in hundreds to
certain popular teachers at a low price. They
coine in tens—or ■ twos—to artists who charge a
price which will add cream to the bananas. And,
as one never knows, in any given year, whether
he can sell enough pictures to pay for the framing,
they are very welcome.
Sid Long's pictures of note and moment number
only half-a-dozen or so; for, though President of
N.S.W. Society of Artists, it is still a short time
since he made painting his profession. One,
“The Valley,” hangs in Adelaide Art Gallery;
in the Sydney Galfery there are three—“ Midday, ”
“Tranquil Waters,” and Pan; and the picture
of “The Spirit of the Plains,” reproduced else-
where in this issue, still decorates the artist’s
studio, though to my mind the most charming of
his works. It is such a scene as, except in drought-
time, you may see almost any evening on the
N.S.W. plains beyond Gunnedah—a moon risen
through the remnant of a sun-glow, and by the
trees, in the haze, the “native companions” minc-
ing and trooping. The nymphwho leads them is of
Mr. Long’s invention ; and I could have dispensed
with her. Ethereal though she be, she is not so
ethereal as the landscape. The birds belong to the
landscape ; the lady belofigs rather to Mr. Long’s
imagination. In “Pan” even the landscape
belongs to Mr. Long’s imagination. : It is worse
than factitious: it is fictitious ; and the fiction
does not impress or convince (me). In the one
case Mr. Long seems to have steeped himself in
his picture ; in the other, he seems to have steeped
his picture in Mr. Long.
To the pictures named add many minor studies
and sketches; often happily touched and full of
charm. Mr. Long is a poet of the brush; and
rhymes sweet cadences in color. I find in his
painted harmonies no masculine power, but a soft
feminine solace. And even when I think he fails
to-paint to the,height of his dreams, I recognise
that in the pursuit of possibly faithless dreams,
rather than in the faithful representation of facts,
there is the fullest scope for whatever one may
have of the vision and the faoulty divine.

W. H. Malyon, Esq., Man. Chemist, Ballarat.
Dear Sir, —For years past (about ten), I have been
troubled with “ Acne” in its worst form, and have sought
advice from the best Australian and London doctors, with
only fair results. A Victorian friend of mine, some four
or five weeks ago, sent me a tin of your “ Ligmolliene,”
and speaking very highly of its wonderful curative powers.
I naturally took same “ Cum Grano Sails,” and was in-
clined not to use it ; eventually I tried your ointment
with truly marvellous results, and am now entirely cured ;
and think people who suffer from skin diseases are greatly
indebted to you for your wonderful remedy. I shall
advise all my friends with skin troubles to use same.
Wishing “ Ligomolliene ” all the success it richly deserves,
Yours faithfully, GEORGE J. O'REGAN.
WHAT THE DOCTORS SAY
Doyeton-street, Ballarat,
My dear Mr. Malyon, — August 21st, 1898.
With great pleasure I now sit down to record progress
with regard to my old enemy, “ Eczema Capitis,” from
which I suffered, notwithstanding constant treatment for
some years under the prescription of Professor M‘Call
Anderson and other eminent dermatologists, with only
partial and temporary relief. When I met you I com-
menced somewhat sceptically your ointment Ligmolliene,
and after about two months’ treatment I may honestly say
my enemy is defeated, and I am perfectly well. I will only
add that since I commenced the treatment of myself I have
prescribed it to others, and am still doing so with brilliant
results. Please accept my hearty thanks, and remain yours
sincerely, THOS. LE GAY tIOLTHOUSE, M.R.C.S., L.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A Jordan Greek (Q.) prospector reports
the discovery of a lake 2700 ft. above sea level.
He was taken to it by blacks. The lake is three-
quarters of a mile in dia., and is located at the
top of the dividing range between the Herbert,
the Beatrice, the Tully, and the south branch of
the Johnstone. In one place there is but 30ft. of
embankment. If this gives way, there is enough
water in the lake, depth practically unfathomable,
to flood all the low-lying land on the south branch
of the Johnstone.
Rounsevell (“ Big Ben ”), just sent back
to S.A. Assembly, has been for six years out of
politics. In 1893 he was a temporary kind of
Treasurer under Downer, but at the ’93 election
he was beaten at Yorke’s Peninsula, being a bad
fourth among nine candidates. Before that, how-
ever, he had been for 18 consecutive years in the
House, and it was he who defeated Dr. Cockburn
at Burra in ’B7. He first became a Minister in the
Morgan Cabinet in ’Bl, the year Kingston en-
tered the House, and altogether, before his rejec-
tion, he had served at various times 1300 days as
a Minister. Once he sat for Port Adelaide as a
chastened Radical, but now he is a hardshell Tory
again, although too good-tempered to be really
dangerous.
Malediction.
May my laughter, O Heaven
Pursue like a knell
When I hurl him unshriven
And shrieking to hell.
.’Twas bis crafty doing.
That threw us apart,
That drove me to ruin,
And broke her young heart.
Such a tongue had the liar
No girl could but trust—
Have the brands of hell-fire
My hatred, his lust ?
She died with hands waving
And bosom stripped bare ;
She thought in her raving
The villain was there.
Have you felt your blood freezing,
Your hair stand up straight,
When delirium is seizing
Your fever-parched mate ?
Have you felt the sky spinning,
The earth turning round,
When your horse is just winning
You’re thrown to the ground ?
Have you felt your brain splitting,
Then stop with a shock,
When your ship lurches, slitting
Her side on a rock ?
My stretched brain was tenseless
Sprung by her last moan,
And gasping and senseless
I fell like a stone. . . .
In the night’s starry splendor
I yearn and she’s near,
Her soul is too tender
To abandon me here.
In spite of this yearning
I grip for his throat :
Were his soul in hell burning,
Oh, how I would gloat !
Too often I’m dreaming
She whispers —forgive !
But I wake to my scheming,
For that is to live.
I know we are nearing
Each other each day,
I feel he is fearing
The hand that shall slay.
My frame is all thrilling,
My soul seems to swim
Like a shark to the killing
Of a villain like him !
ARTHUR A. D. BAYLDON.
No Sadness in the Song They Sing.
They tell us—in the dear angelic choir
No sound can blend and blur of earthly pain ;
That purely sweet the glorious notes aspire
Unconscious all of nether bliss and bane;
Supernal voices rise in glad refrain,
Supernal harps in raptures surge and ring,
While echoes fall afar in golden rain—
There is no sadness in the songs they sing.
And yet —the tend’rest chords of human lyre
The gentle minstrel hand would strike in vain,
If songs of ours were filled with angel fire
And purged and purified of mortal stain ;
To ev’ry link of Earth’s melodious chain
The pendant pearls of earthly tears must cling,
And tears are none wherecherubslift the strain—
There is no sadness in the song they sing !
And though, at times we fain were lifted higher
Above the mortal throng that plead and plain ;
Though human hearts may sob and droop and tire
And yearn for yonder fair harmonious train ;
T’were little joy by that Celestial main
To hear the seraph chorus sweep and swing ;
The lays we love no angel bands attain —
There is no sadness in the songs they sing.
ENVOI.
O soaring souls— how soon ye droop again
That kindly Earth may kiss your weary wing;
O Harps of Gold ! How soon your anthems wane,
There is no sadness in the song ye sing!
Brisbane.

Dad’s Re[?]rn.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dad s coming out, so mother says, from Darling-
hurst to-day,
And we ve got to be most careful what we do and
what we say,
Because we’re nut supposed to know, although ib
, ma y seem odd,
He s not been mining in the West—but doing time
in quod !
We have not had a happy time, no matter how we
tried,
And all our troubles started when our father went
inside ;
For bills and lawyers’ letters came and summonses
were sent
Until the bailiff took away the furniture for rent.
Then Joe he lost his billet, and he went upon the
spree,
Which was mighty rough on mother and ’Lizabeth
and me ;
And the ebap as walked with Lizzie he don’t come
now any more
From what he heard the postman say one morn-
ing at the door.
I m sure it was that letter made him chuck her
up and slope,
For something ’bout the gaol it said upon the
envelope.
It s nothing but a wicked shame, and worse than
any crime
To advertise that folks has gob a father " doing
time.”
Then someone must have seen it too, and put us
all away—
The very thing that mother feared would come
about some day.
So now they know about us all, and what it wa*
he did.
Sometimes I hear them calling me the forger’s
little kid.
But mother’s at the mangle sbill, and Lizzie’s at
the tub;
And I am at the factory, and Joe is at the pub.;
And things is only middling, and by no meaus very
Ray,
And Dad is coming out again from Darlinghurst
to-day.

Adelaide has no doubt the most eloquent
“ colored gentleman ” in Australia —V. A.
Wordie, once a shining light in literary-circles,
and now a frequent press-contributor. Kidston’s
proposal to give every adult white male in Queens-
land a referendum vote moved him, as usual, to
denounce 'the drawing of the color-line; and he
got home in this Fitzgibbonian sentence: —
This persistent determination on the part of one sec-
tion of her Majesty’s subjects in this hemisphere to
deprive others, who are their fellow subjects, of rights
and privileges naturally and equally theirs on the ground
of race and complexion stands out in strange contrast
with the expressions of sympathy which have recently
been sent out to the white British’ subjects in the Trans-
vaal, who are setting up claims to equality of right in the
exercise of the franchise -in a country in which they are
as much foreigners as if they were residing in a foreign
European country.


THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems.*
“N.Z.R.” to The Bulletin :
“Puhaki”(B. 6/5/’99), on want of cattle-stops on M.L.
railways, suggests that the casual cow and train will meet
on a bridge some day, with dire results to all parties.
They did \fneet at Tiriki-road (Taranaki) some time ago,
the cow coming out a bad second. The couplings broke
and saved the carriages—and, incidentally, a few lives
too—but the engine and three trucks tumbled gracefully
into the creek with bits of cow clinging to wheels. Enough
damage was done to rolling-stock and bridge to fence the
line for miles. Owner of cow charged with allowing the
late lamented to trespass, and fined £1 and costs.

Nathalia, the Vic. township where one
Rev. Gladstone has been revealing the after
supper peccadilloes of the local married women,
appears to own a fine type of Australian morals.
The Nathalia murders of some years back—grue-
somely horrible tales of incest and infanticide —
made the place infamous. It may be noted that
the parson’s sermon doesn’t refer to the evils of
dancing “on its own.” Vide newspaper reports; “A
woman who allowed herself to have hands placed
on her after social functions was a wanton. The
women of the Goulburn Valley were cursed with
this spirit.” The syntax of the first sentence is a
trifle mixed ; but, nevertheless
At the local ball Masonic
Was the Eev’rend George a victim ?
Was it conscience then that pricked him
To this woeful wordy tonic 1
With a dusty heel he’s kicked ’em,
With a scourging tongue he’s flicked ’em J
But our morals aren’t laconic,
And our souls are embryonic,
Our virtue is a failure,
And our naughty fits are chronio;
We will don our best regalia
And we’ll leave our old Idalia
For the sake of love platonic
And the matrons of Nathalia.
For the Goulburn Valley ladies—
Patricians as plebeians—
Are sanctified Fijians,
Devout Terpsichoreans,
And they mark the road to Hades
For the local Galileans.
So let us join in paeans
To their giddy Saturnalia ;
Let us leave Hongkong and Cadiz
Where the thorny way displayed is ;
Let us hasten from Ismalia ;
Pack our trunks for our Australia
Where the broadest, steepest grade is,
And the devil himself dismayed is
By the matrons of Nathalia.

The Legend.
IT was in the summer of 1778, Wash-
ington, with his army ever active,
determined to oppose the British
general, Sir Henry Clinton, who, having
evacuated Philadelphia, was retreating
through Hew’Jersey on Hew York. The
forces met on 28th June at Monmouth.
La Payette conducted the attack. The
heat was so intense that some refused to
fight, and many fell dead from exposure
to the sun’s rays. Both sides fought
desperately. As the day waned, and the
flagging spirits of La Fayette’s soldiers
were at a low ebb, a strange sight aroused
them. Marching with drum and fife
was an old man, Jeremiah Wynton, and
his son, and grandson. The old father,
with silvery flowing locks, sturdily strode
through the field. The son with ban-
daged head fifing lustily, the youth,
catching the spirit of his grandsire, rolled
out with him the soul-inspiring rattle of
the drum. Father, son, and grandson
had accompanied the troops as volunteers,
and were ever in the forefront of the
fight. The fierce light of battle was in
their eyes, they knew no fear, and many
a wild cheer arose, as on that fateful
day Yankee Hoodie was heard as never
was heard before or since.

SATURDAY, JUNE 24, 1899.
A Reconstructed Sydney.
During the recent Federal unpleasantness one
speaker of the parochial party demanded that
N.S.W. should reject any Federal scheme which
did not place the capital of the Commonwealth in
Sydney, his reason being that Sydney was “one
of the most beautiful cities in the world.” He
claimed, in fact, that Sydney was entitled to be
the Federal centre, not only because it was the
oldest city in Australia, and because whatever
venerable and unpleasant associations there are in
the country hang around it; but also on account
of its own beauties and architectural merits. And
that deliverance has set The Bulletin thinking
hard ever since. The world hasn’t founded very
many absolutely new cities within the last 120
years—in an arbitrary sort of way the writer
will consider any place of over 200,000 popu-
lation dignified enough to be called a city,
and leave the exact meaning of the word
out of consideration. Sydney, Melbourne,
Chicago, San Francisco, Brooklyn, Cincin-
nati, St. Louis, Cleveland, Buffalo, Washington,
and about half-a-dozen more may be said to ex-
haust the list. These are the places which started
fair, when man had become civilised enough to
know how to lay out a city, if he wasn’t too tired.
They weren’t burdened, like London, Paris, Koine,
Florence, Munich, old Dutch New York, Rio
Janeiro, Vienna, Mexico, Edinburgh, Venice, and
most other large centres, with an old mediteval
town, laid out on spider’s-web lines in the days
when man believed that crooked streets helped to
keep off devils. And among all these new cities
Sydney—considering the place itself apart from
its harbor and other extraneous circumstances—is
the worst and most utterly awful specimen. So far
from being a place whose beauty makes it the
natural capital of an Australian Commonwealth,
it is a place whose construction and whose waste
of opportunity unfits it to be a decent capital of
anything. Among all the great new centres of
the civilised world, Sydney started with the best
opportunity and made the worst possible use of it.
And now there are three alternatives. The
people of Sydney can start a reform so far as their
future city is concerned. It will probably grow,
in course of years, to ten times its present size, and
the inhabitants can resolve that, however bad the
present city is, all the new additions to it shall be
built with long, wide, straight streets, and that
New Sydney shall be an ideal city, whatever Old
Sydney may be. This was what was done with
JNew York ; the old angular Dutch town still re-
mains to a certain extent, but a gorgeous new
merman city has been added on to the contorted
fragment left behind by Petek the Testy and his
contemporaries. Or they may face the necessity
ol re-building their awful city as Napoleon 111.

Cl ty go on expanding on the same Grooked lines,
and content themselves with lying about its
imaginary beauties, and with calling whoever
advocates better things a foreign hireling and an
emissary of the enemy.
* * * *
Sydmprhas practically only two outlets to the
south Elizabeth and George-streets. York-street,
Clarence-street, Kent-street and Sussex-street all
perish on the way, so to speak. So do Pitt-street
and Castlereagh -street. Both Castlereagh-street
and Elizabeth-street are cut in two by the curious,
angular mass of bye-ways that lie about Bligh and
Bent Streets. Macquarie, Phillip, and College
streets die off in the middle of the city. It has
only two outlets to the east—William-street, which
breaks up into two lanes where it becomes South
Head Road, and then becomes a street again : and
Gxford-street. The rest of the streets running
east and west die very young. It has no definite
outlet westward except by crooked Parramatta-
road. George, Elizabeth, and Pitt streets are full
ot strange, unnatural crooks and angles ; so are
Market, King, and Hunter streets. In a large
number of cases, the people who built the streets
on the west side of George-street apparently
weren t speaking to those who built the streets on
the east, and, consequently, the two sets of streets
don t meet in a straight line. There was no
attempt made at keeping the streets parallel ; to
the west of George-street there are hardly any two
thoroughfares which don’t stagger ridiculously on
the map either towards each other or away from
each other, and from Liverpool-street south to
Oleveland-street the map of Sydney is a crazy-
quilt pattern far gone in drink. Between Bridge
and Hunter streets the map is a delirium tremens.
Among the city streets there are just about half-a-
dozen College-street and Macquarie-street being
the most notable examples—-which are wide and
straight enough to pass muster. The rest urgently
demand total destruction and reconstruction on

. How many millions would it take to rebuild the
city? And how are these millions to be raised ?
And, more than all, how is the weary, apathetic
Sydneyite to be roused to a knowledge that his
city wants reconstruction. The N.S.W. capital,
with its lovely surroundings, has a chance to be
the most beautiful among the world’s new cities,
instead of almost the ugliest. And the wholesale
rebuilding of Paris, and the partial reconstruction
of London by the Council, are proofs that the re-
building can be done, if only the energy and the
financial and architectural ability are forthcoming.
* * * *
At present the evil is going from bad to worse.
There are about 40 pocket-handkerchief munici-
palities in and about the N.S.W. metropolis.
When one of these opens a new street it never
feels called upon to keep it in line with any street
belonging to anyone of the three or four adjacent
municipalities, so the new Sydney which is grow-
ing up around old Sydney looks like a new series
of cobwebs, and cart-wheels, and crazy-quilts.
And the 40 sets of mayors, aldermen, town-clerks,
and so on, won’t either adopt new principles or
give up their authority—or, if they do give it up
after years of struggle and negotiation, they will
by that time have done damage which will be
almost past repair. The first step to reform is for
Parliament to grab all these toy municipalities
with authority, and abolish the lot, and replace
them by a central authority, on the principle of
the London County Council, but with even larger
powers, which will control the whole district lying
between Middle Harbor on the north and Cook’s
River on the south, and as far west as Field of
Mars and Homebush. Then there would be a
chance of some system in the laying-out of
new Sydney. The total liabilities of the
metropolitan district are now about <£2,100,000,
and the interest thereon averages £4 12s!
per cent, per annum, but the credit of
the new County Council would certainly be
good enough to renew the lot as they fell in at 3£.
This would mean a saving of £23,000 a year.
Probably another £lO,OOO a year could be saved
by the economy of keeping one administration in-
stead of 40 as at present. These two items would
afford £36,000 a year with which to begin the re-
construction of Sydney.
* * * *
The rest of the money would have to be sup-
plied by the simple dreary process of extra taxa-
tion. The highest municipal rate anywhere about
Sydney (Manly only excepted) is Is. Gd. in the £.
In some municipalities the rate is as low as Is. or
even 9d. N.S.W. is so accustomed to dodge
taxation by borrowing that these figures are con-
sidered high. The small municipalities around
Melbourne are, generally speaking, more sol-
vent than those around Sydney not that
even they are anything to boast of; and the
simple explanation is that their maximum
rate is 2s. 6d. in the £. In England 6s. in the £
is not at all uncommon, and Bs. isn’t quite un-
heard-of. Manchester pays 6s. Bd. in the £. The
rate used to be about ss. 7d., but the citizens
decided that a canal to connect their inland city
with the sea would be a valuable improvement
and they cheerfully pay Is. Id. in the £ extra tax
to help cover the cost. If the people of Sydney
had about half this courage and would face an all-
round municipal rate of 3s. 6d. in the £ ; the extra
tax and the money to be saved by consolidating
the debts should supply an extra revenue of nearly
£350,000 a year with which to begin the recon-
struction of the lamentable city.
* * * *
If the work isn’t commenced now it will have
to be attempted later on when there is per-
haps five times as large a contract to be faced.
I here is no reason why Sydney should not
one day be a city of 4,000,0000 people, in-
stead of a little over 400,000 as at present.
North and south there are, to all intents and pur-
poses, two narrow, crooked streets—George-
street and Elizabeth-street—to carry the traffic
of that future city, for the other streets pour
their traffic by quaint crooks and angles into
these two. They are overloaded with the traffic
that already exists—considering that Melbourne
city has nine wide, straight thoroughfares extend-
ing north and south, this is not to be wondered at.
And there are only two or three crooked streets
which cut right through the city from east to
west, while Melbourne has five wide and four
narrow ones. Sydney’s two outlets to the eastern
suburbs, when Sydney grows to eight or ten times
its present size, will probably look more like an
insurrection in Sheol than anything else It
isn't impossible even now to make Sussex
Kent, Clarence, York, George, Pitt, Castle-
reagh, and Elizabeth street eight wide,
straight parallel thoroughfares running in a
bee-line through Sydney, Redfern and Water-
loo, or to straighten and widen the whole tangle
of cross streets, or to reorganise the wilderness of
the suburbs. The great re-organisation can be
started now, partly from necessity and partly
from choice, or it can be done wholly through
necessity, some 20 or 30 or 40 years hence, when
there may be a city of 1,500,000 people to recon-
struct instead of one of 420,000 ; and the work
will be larger, and the cost vastly greater.
* * * *
It takes a great deal of hard lying now to
describe Sydney as a city to be proud of. By-
and-bye, if it continues to grow on its present
lines, it will take so much more lying that no
one will be equal to the effort. To save both
money and lying The Bulletin believes that the
work of reconstruction should be commenced at
once. A municipal tax of 3s. 6d. in the £ isn’t
much to face for a comparatively few years—
other communities which haven’t nearly so high
an opinion of themselves have faced far heavier
burdens for ttie sake of their native cities. If
Paris, with 1,600,000 people, could tackle the
enormous work of reconstruction, Sydney can do
it. If the work is done out of revenue, and not by
borrowing, it will make a boom while it lasts that
will go a long way to compensate for the expense.
The employment supplied in the process of
reconstruction, and the extra population attracted
by the work of reconstruction, would make a boom
in themselves—a boom in stone-cutting, brick-
making, timber-getting, in groceries, clothes,
drink and tobacco; also a boom in corner allot-
ments when the new streets were opened for selec-
tion. The new Sydney, with streets twice their
present width, would stretch out far beyond its
present limits and greatly increase the value of
suburban property. Also the spreading - out
would increase railway and tramway receipts.
The bloated landlord would have a boom. If a
whole block in the business part of G-eorge-street
was being demolished in one act the landlords
would be able to let their empty premises in adja-
cent streets to the ejected tenants in the meantime,
and get rentals from them that would compensate
for their share of the extra taxation. The business
part of the city, when it was spread out by the
wholesale widening of the streets, would probably
extend down to Hay-street, or the cheerful
Devonshire-street cemetery, and that would mean
a great profit by the increase of land-values in the
city itself. In a good many slum streets there
would be very little expense in the way of com-
pensation for buildings demolished ; the buildings
could be got rid of by righteously condemning
thein as unfit for human habitation. About such
regions as Wexford-street and other historic
haunts of the push, the extra land-values which
could be created by making wide, bright thorough-
fares in place of dismal alleys would probably pay
for the entire work of reconstruction. When the
London County Council bought up a huge mass
of old property and made Northumberland
Avenue, it resold what land it had left on each
side of the new street, and had <£119,000 profit on
the whole job.
* * * •
The Bulletin offers these ideas seriously, though
the Sydney public will probably take them as
an elaborate joke. The Australian understands
borrowing; he understands deficits; he under-
stands the art of shuffling off the responsibility a
day or two longer by relief works—sand-shifting
and rail-painting and forest-thinning out of loan
moneys. And because the Cornstalk capital is a
great, awful, straggling failure its people have
Become the more aggressive in talking in its
defence. They have either to make it what it
ought to be, or to say it is all it ought to be
already, and the latter is the easier process. The
Bulletin suggests for a change that they acknow-
ledge Sydney to be what it is—about the worst-
devised city of its age, and considering its
opportunities and natural advantages, upon this
earth. And that they thereupon proceed to make
it what it might and should be —the most beauti-
ful city on the face of the globe, and one that the
Cornstalk of all the future generations may be
honestly proud of.
The Hands of Esau.
The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands
of Esau.— Old Scripture Legend.
Maoriland has a general election some time
this year, and the eminently Respectable Party
is girding up its scant and bony loins for the
fray. Three times—in 1890, ’93 and ’96—the
Conservative crowd has gone to the polls with-
out a policy except the statement that the other
side was going to ruin the country, and that
Seddon was an autocrat and had” once been
known to the west coast Chows as Bun Tuck,
and that .Jock McKenzie had aimed a pickle-
bottle at Fish, and that Ward was a more or
less aggravated insolvent, and similar person-
alities. It went down each time quite
naturally. Any community possessed of sense
wants to know what a proposed new Govern-
ment intends to do not merely what disagree-
able character the present Government is alleged
to have aimed a bottle at. In the absence of
any definite information on this head, the
country was merely invited to put the Tory
party in office on the ground that Russell and
Dismal Bill Rolleston and the rest were spot-
less characters who could always be trusted
to do the right thing. And the country
decided each time that the security wasn’t
good enough. It admitted that Russell was
one of the most affable gentlemen going, and
any wet cat that had chanced to get shut out
late at night would unhesitatingly go home
with him after one glance at his grand old
patrician countenance. But half the disastrous
things in this world are done by noble old
gentlemen who don’t know any better, and the
country asked for particulars. Failing them
it stuck to Seddon and “Jock” M'Kenzie.’
The Tory party alleged that they were large
and coarse and hobnailed, but so long as their
Socialistic policy went straight and succeeded,
Maori land wi-ely preferred them to the fine old
aristocrat who had been all his days only an
agreeable political failure and a good subject
for a Vandyke portrait.
* * * *
This time, however, the Russell party goes
to the country with a programme, and its main
fe i.Lu res are these :
Optional conversion of leasehold tenure into conditional
Ireehold, the purchas'e-nioney to be devoted to roads and
Ihtuo'( j s and lands for sett lenient purposes, without havjn”'
recourse to the British money-lender; vigorous settle-
ment on native lauds; alleviation of taxation on mort-
gages; an independent Civil-service hoard, an elective
Upp r House, extension of local government, with a con-
sequent decentralising public works system ; continuance
of the present experimental legislation, in order that the
country may give it full and fair play ; and a reduction
of the customs dues upon the necessaries of life coupled
with judicious retrenchment all round.
That is the programme of the large landlord-
party in Maoriland up to date, and The Bel-
JjETIn moves that the said party be found
guilty thereon of being a fraud and a public
enemy.
* * * *
The place where the cloven-hoof sticks out
most conspicuously is in the perpetual cry about
“experimental legislation.” All the things
that Maoriland has gained during the past
eight years—-the State Land Bank system, the
policy of acquiring large estates in order to
supply the people with small farms, the gradu-
ated land-tax, which is steadily breaking up
the big estates, the absentee-tax, old-age “pen-
sions, factories legislation, with the con-
sequent shortening of hours and improve-
ment of sanitary conditions, workmen compen-
sation policy, conciliation laws, and all the rest
—are carefully and invariably described by the
retrograde old gentlemen as “experimental
legislation.” No matter how successful any one
of these ideas may be, it is always alluded
to as a thing that is on its trial and liable to
be revoked at any moment, unless it shows
such extraordinary good results that even the
old-gentleman party dare not attempt revoca-
tion. The party’s general attitude may be
summed up thus : Foreign borrowing, freehold
ownership of land with abundant facilities for
the accumulation of large estates ; the freedom
of big landholders from taxation ; an Upper
House based on property representation;
plenty of cheap imports, and all other Tory
legislation (when the Tory party gets a chance
to pass it) is not experimental. It is the ordi-
nary fixed, permanent, solid variety of legisla-
tion. It hasn’t to put up any special record to
secure its own continuance ; all Fat Man legis-
lation is to continue as a matter of course,
unless its utter badness is so definitely proved
that its continuance is impossible. "And all
Lean Man legislation is experimental, and
is to discontinue as a matter of course, unless
it produces such overwhelming evidence
in its own favor that its discontinuance is im-
possible. The law that was made by and for
the Fat Man is in the position of the free citi-
zen who isn’t to be put in gaol unless someone
proves his guilt. The law that was made for
the Lean Man is, according to the political
vocabulary of Fat, in the state of a person
who is naturally, and as a matter of course, in
gaol under suspicion, and not to be released
until he proves his innocence. Which is a
great difference.
* * * *
And the attitude of the Maoriland Tory party
includes something more than this. Not only
does it carefully distinguish between laws
that are good for the Fat Man, which are
assumed to be naturally permanent, and laws
that are good for the masses, which it assumes
to be only experimental—transitory— not meant
to last unless some unusual circumstance occurs
to alter the situation—always under suspicion,
and on trial, and liable to execution at any
moment. But it also, after thus exhibiting its
undying prejudice against all the new and
democratic institutions created by the present
Government, asks the people to put the manage-
ment of these institutions in its hands, so that
it can bring them into discredit by managing
them as badly as possible and making them
failures. And it also asks the people to put it
in a position where it will be the sole judge as
to whether these institutions are failures or
not. If the Land Bank and the Closer Settle-
ment system are entrusted to the control of the
men who always prophesied their certain
failure, and these men are allowed to manage
them so as to make them fail, and are made the
sole judges as to whether they have failed or
not—well, the only possible result is that they
will fail.
* * * *
Even the promise to give the alleged experi-
mental legislation a fair show—so far as a
thorough-going enemy can be fair—is worthless
on the face of it. For it is proposed at the
very outset to wreck one of the most important
parts of that legislation by allowing the new
State leaseholders to purchase their lands, and
thus substituting private for State ownership,
and getting back to the old bad days and the
old bad ways of big estates and great landed
magnates. The Maoriland lease-in-perpetuity
system has only been in force for six years, and
the proposed peremptory undoing of it is the
lory party’s idea of giving the “ experimental
legislation an unbiassed trial. Further, the
party proposes to reduce the tax on mortgages
at present all land, mortgaged or otherwise,
pays the same tax, only the Fat Man who has a
lien on the property has to pay the mortgage-
tax, and the Tory party, if it gets into power,
intends to set about relieving the Fat Man
foi thwith. Also, part of the customs-taxation
is to be taken off—the loss of revenue through
this and the reduction in the Fat Man’s mort-
gage-tax being made good by the sale of the
leased lands. The assurance that the Russell
party will use the land-sale money for public
works purposes, without “having recourse to
the British lender,” means nothing; the roads
and bridges are almost wholly built out of
revenue now, and the Tories only promise
that they will blew the public estate to pay
the things that are now paid out of taxation.
• * « *
Last, and most sinister of all, the Maoriland
Tory party is in favor of an elective Upper
House—how elected is not stated. Elective
Upper Houses are of two kinds—those freely
chosen by the people, which exist mainly in
theory as yet and in the pages of the Draft
Federal Constitution ; and those chosen by the
propertied section of the people only. Victoria
is blessed with the latter kind. Its unpaid
members are elected by persons with property,
and no person except a very large owner of
property is eligible for membership. There-
fore the most democratic section of the com-
munity has no voice in choosing the Yic. Coun-
cil, and those who have a voice are forced to
elect the narrowest and most supercilious of
J ories because they can’t find Democrats with
the needful property qualification. The Coun-
cil can t be swamped by new members. It can’t
be reformed because its members won’t pass the
necessary Bill for their own reformation—it is
a perpetual and almost impregnable snag and
stumbling-block. If that is the kind of
elective Upper House which the Maoriland
lory party desires to create, and the
country gives it a chance to carry out its pur-
pose. Maoriland isn’t likely to he troubled


thereafter with any more progressive legislation
for the next half-century. And it is a dead
sure thing that the Tory party doesn’t propose
to strengthen the hands of its enemies by
creating the other kind of elective Upper House.
• • * *
Therefore, the finding of this Court is that
the Maoriland Tory party is retrograde, and a
fossil, and an underhand fraud, and that it
shall be hanged in a high, windy place by its
political neck until it is utterly defunct.
Australia Always First.
The Bulletin has, and always had, deep
sympathy with the Australian Labor parties
in politics. They are doing a very necessary
work; fighting, against heavy odds, a^ fight of
the greatest moment to democracy. The ideal
State has no parties ; but under the far from ideal
governments of Australia a Labor combination is
the essential counterpoise to the perpetual
Capitalist combination—if the worker is to
get his chance and his due from the organ-
ised community. It is a misfortune that
the leaders and wire-pullers of Australian Labor-
parties are so often men of mean capacity, of
narrow outlook, eager to impute the worst to an
opponent, ready to rend, for an honest difference
of opinion, even the friends and colleagues who
have served the Labor movement best.
* * * *
These remarks are caused by the attitude
assumed by the Q. Worker and a section of the
Q. Labor-party in regard to W. G. Higgs’ vote on
the Q. Federal Enabling Bill. Higgs has been for
many years associated with the Labor movement
in N.S.W. and Queensland ; he has been for five
years editor of Q. WORKER, and his conduct of
that paper while the Q.N. Bank corruption was
being exposed did immense service to the com-
munity. His solid qualities of character lately
won him a seat in Brisbane Council and in Q.
Assembly ; and the Worker trustees publicly
thanked him for his efforts and regretted his de-
parture from their service. Incidentally, they
took the opportunity to (very judiciously) omit
the motto of “Socialism in Our Time,” which
Higgs had kept before the Worker readers.
* * * •
The other day Q. Assembly came to vote on
Premier Dickson’s Federal Enabling Bill. So
far as can be judged, Premier Dickson is really
desirous of helping the Federal movement; but he
has not the least intention of sacrificing his office
or his party to Federation. The Government
party includes some supporters of Federation, and
some bitter opponents ; the majority appear luke-
warm. The Q. Labor party is almost equally
divided in theory; in practice, its influence has
been given against the present Federal move-
ment. The Q. Worker is allied with the reac-
tionary party —with Hugh Nelson and the
stagnants of the Legislative Council, with the
black-labor employers—against any Federation
whatever. It cartoons “ F’ederation ”as a mangy
dog ; and its new editor, in an outburst of ridicul-
ous rhetoric, images the Australian Common-
wealth as one more engine of accursed Capital—
under the most democratic constitution the world
has ever seen !
* * » *
Yet, of all the provinces, none has more to gain
from Federation than Queensland. The Q. Labor-
party has been unable to wrest One-man-one-vote
from the Govt, even for the Assembly ; it will get
One-man-one-vote for both the Federal Houses,
and provincial electoral reform cannot fail to be
hastened when Q. is allied with the One-man-one-
vote province of N.S. Wales, with the One-adult-
one-vote province of South Australia. The Q.
Labor-party has been unable to save its province
from being flooded with colored labor, but 4 its hands
will be immensely strengthened when it is allied
with the white provinces of Southern Australia.
In these two vital points of electoral reform and
abolition of colored labor, and in many others,
Queensland has everything to gain by union with
the other provinces, everything to lose by standing
aloof. Yet a section of the Q. Labor-party and
the party’s official organ —the Worker —oppose
Federation; and only one Labor representative was
democratic enough, was Australian enough, to
vote for Australia—W. G. Higgs.
* * * *
If Federation had been made a party question,
the condemnation of Higgs might be understood,
if it could not be justified ; but the question was
formally left open. If even there was the least
chance of getting a better Bill, or better terms
in the vote for the Biff, the attitude of the
Worker might have admitted some defence. But
there was no chance whatever. Premier Dickson
had to force the nominee Council to swallow
a one-man-one-vote Federal Constitution, and for
the referendum he abolished the plural vote. If,
in addition, he had enfranchised the voters not
upon the rolls, would his party have'followed him?
would the Council have supported him ? Any
man who, knowing Q. political history for the
past dozen years, does not realise that Dickson
went absolutely as far as he could, if the Bill was
to pass at all, in The Bulletin’s opinion proves
his political judgment worthless.
* * * •
Kidston, the member who moved the debated
amendment, is a Separationist and ananti-Federa-
tionist. The Worker, which supported the
debated amendment, has come out as an anti-
Federationist. Half the members of the Q. Labor
party are anti-Federationists. If Higgs had voted
with the Labor caucus, he would have voted
against Australia. And Australia comes always
first before Separation, before the Labor
party, before all movements and parties. Higgs
had to consider, too, the effect of the close Q.
division upon the crucial N.S. W. vote. If Drake
and he had voted the other way, the Bill would
have been lost, and the example of the Q. Assem-
bly used to ruin the Federal movement in N.S.W.
* * * *
The fate of the Govt, was never in question.
To say that Higgs saved the Govt, is pure bosh.
If anyone imagines that the Dickson Ministry
would have resigned on a defeat in regard to
Federation —which Premier Dickson distinctly
said was a non-party matter —he does not know
the elements of Boodlewraith. Federation would
have been damned so far as Queensland is con-
cerned; but the Ministry, regaining its anti-
Federal adherents, would go on uninfluenced.
* * * *
It comes to this : that the Q. Labor-party had
a splendid chance to prove its intelligence, to
prove its democracy, to prove its regard for Aus-
tralia, and only one man took it—W. G. Higgs.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Another 40 Plank Platform.
The first Trades Union Congress ever held in
Westralia met recently at Coolgardie, and
demanded a few tilings which must have
sounded like aggravated blasphemy to the men
who represent innumerable sheep in the Perth
Legislature. Among others it asked, for
adult suffrage, one-man-one-vote, every man to
be qualified for the franchise after six months
residence, all elections to be held on one day, a
redistribution of seats on a population basis,
and payment of members. Presumably these
ideas refer to both Houses, for in W.A. both
Houses are elected by people with property.
The Congress demanded several dozen other
reforms, but the above were the principal ones ;
if they can be secured the people will have the
whole Parliamentary machine in their hands,
and then they can attend to the rest them-
selves. And probably it would have been as
well if the Congress had stopped when it got to
the end of the above list. For it went on to
show its whole hand, and told the autocrats
who represent miles of saltbush and thousands
of woolly animals what it intended to do when
it had got the power it aimed at; and the
revelation is calculated to make these find-
headed men of sheep hold on to their present
power until red revolution fires them out. In
such places as Queensland and W.A., the 40-
plank platform business is a mistake. I he
Boodle party in power hates socialistic reform ;
and the candid acknowledgment of Labor that
it wants power so as to bring into force a mul-
titude of socialistic reforms which wilPbe good
for the people, but woefully bad for the
Boodlers in office, only rouses the Boodlers to
hang on with 20-foid energy. In both pro-
vinces there is an inert middle class which
has slept and dreamt so long under the
Boodle regime that it is scared at the
idea of wholesale improvement, and fears to be
politically washed lest it should catch cold, and
needs to have the 40 planks broken to it
very gently. That middle class is as scared as
an old maid in her night-dress look ng under
the bed, and it can : t stand shocks. If it knew'
no more than that Labor demanded one-man-
one-vote and its fair share of Parliamentary re-
presentation, a great part of it would probably
vote the Labor ticket. Then Labor w mid pro-
bably “get there,” and, having got there, it
could break the news of its 40 planks to the
people one plank at a time, and prove by
actual demonstration that there is nothing
dreadful about them. The man who demands
the whole lot at once gets left, and is an Ish-
maelitish Tommy Dodd holding forth from a gin-
case in the Domain on a wet day. And the
mau who means to get the whole lot, but
doesn’t say so all in a heap, arrives there and
becomes a Ballance or a Seddon. They got
into power by assuring the people that they
were going to wash the body politic in modera-
tion, ami then they kept on washing until the
body politic found, to its surprise, that whole-
sale washing was beneficial.
Where the Beautiful Theories Grow.
Captain Russell, leader of the M.L. Tory
Opposition, pounds away drearily and horribly
at tw'o ideas re the Old Age Pension systenn
One is that the pensions “pauperise the people.”
The other is that, to avoid pauperising the
people, the thing should be fixed on anew basis,
whereby a man shall start at 20 to pay 6d. a
week to the State, and if he keeps it up.till the
age of 65 he will then get an old age pension of
,£2O a year. If he dies before he is 65 his family
is to get back the money he has paid without
interest. The old man’s awful lack of practical
intelligence shines forth conspicuously just
here. Consider these four aspects of Russell’s
theory :
(1) He proposes to bang up a settlement of the poverty
difficulty for about 45 years. The people who are 20 now
would start making provision for their old age by paying
6<l. a week to the State, and if they all did it, and they
all kept on paying for 45 years, ami the arrangement
wasn’t upset by any inrush of middle-aged immigrants
who couldn’t start - paying their 6d. a week at age 20
because they are already 40 or so, the question of old age
and poverty would settle itself about 1945, when the new
crop of eilizens reached the pension age.
(2) He holds to the old exploded idea that if a man pro-
vides for his own pension by paying 6d. a week in com-
pulsory taxation he is a pauper when he gets the pension.
And if he pays the same 6d. voluntarily he isn’t a pauper.
(:i) The Gd. a week raised compulsorily by taxation
costs about a quarter of Jd. to collect. The voluntary 6d.
collected at the taxpayer’s back door would cost about
Ud. to collect. Therefore the voluntary device won d
give much less pension for the money. Also there would
he a fearful and costly system of book-keeping involved
in keeping account of every subscribers separate six-
pences, so that his family could get the exact number of
sixpences hack if he died prematurely.
(4) And not one taxpayer in 1000 would keep up his
weekly 6d. with mathematical regularity for 45 years. So
the other 999 would leave the problem of old age and
poverty and mendicancy just where it was, and the
country would he no further forward than it is now.
Russell’s solution isn’t even the beginning of
a solution, after all. It does a lot to show up
the uselessness of the old, polished, gentle-
manly theorist, and it reveals clearly how a
perfect community would go about the busi-
ness. The Seddon variety of politician tackles
things as they are, while the Russell variety
maunders about how simple and beautiful
things would be, if tilings were as they should
be, and weren’t as they always have been.
The Case of Mary Jane.
“ Constance Clyde ” straggles, in an unchris-
tian sort of way, over a large and difficult sub-
ject :
The result of the official enquiry into the working of
N S VV. State-subsidised charities is just what might, be
expected in a State which neither takes the whole
“charity” business into its own hands nor leaves it en-
tirely alone. Let us take, as a sample, the way in which
State-subsidised charity affects Mary Jane.
No girl is so well looked after-in a sense—as Mary Jane.
When she comes to Sydney there is the Jubilee Home
“ to provide means of escape from the allurements of
citv life for friendless, virtuous young women arriving in
Sydney from the country districts or elsewhere. When
in course of time she “ falls,” to a certain extent,
Ardill’s Home of Hope and “ the Benevolent nave a
place for her ; and when she “falls the rest of the way
the Salvation Armv will sound the loud timbrel over her ;
indeed, it very much prefers her that way. But-
whether she falls completely ‘ flop, or falls only a little
and gets up again-the result is the same. When she
takes a place anew she takes it at a reduced wage, just as if
her conventional morality, or lack thereof, had anything
to do with her ability to cook and wash and scrub.
Says A uni i,t, : “ If a woman lias been a fairly competent
servant before her confinement, she may have to submit
to a reduction of 4s. to ss. per week !” Why?
the institutions, while presumably quite willing that
Mary Jane should have as good a wage after her fall as
before it, have no regulation on the matter ; and, as there
are always a lot more fallen or .falling Mary Janes
waitin'' for admission, the semi-raised M.J. must take
what she can get from, say, the scraggy lodging-house-
keeper, who, through combined virtue and economy,
offers onlv a few miserable shillings a week. .
And there is another reason why the scraggy lodging
house-lydy and her like score. These State-subsidised
institutions are mainly religious institutions, and in the
religious mind still lingers the tradition that Mary Jane
ought to be punished—“ ought to help in bearing her
own burden,” as the matron of such an institution will put
it, more in sorrow than in anger, because the rampantly-
virtuous woman is quite out of date nowadays. Said
matron, indeed, will gently put her hand on the fallen
girl's shoulder, and may even kiss her cheek, as the good
heroine does the bad stage-girl’s, to the immediate
tearful reclamation of said bad girl. (In real life the bad
girl doesn’t care a button, and rather objects to be pawed
by her well-meaning sister.) But all the “niceness of
the matron doesn’t alter the hard fact that fallen Mary
Jane is practically compelled to take her baby into service
with her, and by reason of that unsatisfactory infant
her wages are low, and her hours long, and she is
expected to be ’umble and ready to weep at the shortest
notice. The bantling should only be taken along in the
case of AMEMA-girls who would die or go cranky if little
Georgik wasn't towing at their apron-strings all the time.
And instead of blaming Mary Jane for unnatural ness
when she objects to sacrificing half her wages for the
privilege of having her kiddie with her, it ought to be
recognised as a wise provision of Providence that she so
often prefers to leave the youngster in some asjlunt
where there are women specially trained to look after it.
And, in any case, what she prefers, or doesn’t prefer,
whether her motives are selfish or not selfish, isn’t to the
point, any more than whether she is or isn’t thereby
punished as much as she ought to be. The main question
is—what is best for the kiddie, and for the Mary Jane
profession on the whole ?
The Body of a Solicitor.
The mystery of Alex. Grant M‘lntyre, soli-
citor, puzzles a good many Melbourne people.
Nine months ago this fortunate son of his
father was proceeded against by a brother-in-
law on a charge of—call it “ unsatisfactory
trusteeism.” The result was a Supreme Court
Judge’s order directing said A. G. M‘lntyre,
solicitor, to hand over the title deeds of his
brother-in-law’s estate, together with moneys
due to applicant. A. G. Mac. did not produce
the casli and deeds as directed, so towards the
end of last year the brother-in-law prosecuted
him for larceny as a trustee, or something to
that effect, and got him committed for trial at
Melb. Grim. Court. Time went on, two or
three Crim. Court sittings were held, but
no A. G. M‘lntyre came up for trial. The
omission of his case from the list was beginning
to be talked about outside the courts, when one
Saturday night Mac. was quietly arrested,
under a writ of attachment, for non-compliance
with the Supreme Court order of long ago.
The intervening committal for trial on a plain,
ordinary criminal charge had, seemingly, been
wiped off solicitor MTntyre’s little slate. He
hadn’t been more than four days in Melb. gaol
when there came a hasty application for his re-
lease on the ground that he would surely die if
he were not taken home to be nursed. The
prisoner had already been transferred ftoni liis
cell to the less uncongenial gaol hospital, it ap-
peared. The hasty application for a release
was made ex parte —the other side was not
present to oppose—and Judge Williams
granted it conditionally. A few days later the
aggrieved brother-in-law put in a claim for the
release to be set aside, and the Judge set it
aside (with costs), but only on the understand-
ing that lawyer M'lntyre is not to be popped
back into gaol without leave of the Court. At
present he is understood to be until ted for
imprisonment, but he will have to return
whence he came as soon as he gets stiong
unless he or his relatives refund some of the
missing estate, The Bulletin supposes. The
case is an interesting study of what may hap-
peu in the law-courts where the body of a
solicitor is concerned.
Tlie Wildly Democratic Landlords.
The Victorian minimum wage law shortly
expires. It was passed as a temporary measure,
it being one of the devices of the House of 48
Rich Landlords, w'hen it reluctantly allows a
democratic Act to go through, *to limit its
operation to three years or so, in order that it
may wear out the People’s Chamber by making
it fight the battle over and over again
at every renewal. If it is renewed there will
almost certainly be a great and bitter struggle.
The Melbourne Chamber of Manufactures met
the other day, and solemnly cursed the mini-
mum wage, per medium of Herham, as tending
to destroy “ the splendid feeling that existed
between the just employer and the honest
workman.” The necessity of any law to stand
between the unjust sweater and the honest
workman wasn’t even hinted at. Then that
dreadful trader, Robert Reid, M.L.C., rose
and made some ominous remarks. He said
that the honesty of himself and the other 47
Rich Landlords “went without saying in
fact, Reid, M.L.C., reluctantly admitted his
own perfect character, and felt driven to plead
guilty to being one of the noblest individuals
living. All Reid was afraid of was that the 48
Bloated Landlords were becoming too madly
democratic, and he solemnly warned the
audience that when the Old-Age Pensions Bill
came along the Council would probably rush it
through without amendment, and let the
miserable country take the consequences. In
fact, Victoria was informed that the Propertied
Chamber had broken loose, and was a raging
democratic lion going up and down in the land,
and it was liable to pass legislation of so
intensely radical a character that it w'ould
make the country’s hair stand on end. After
that Victoria had better brace up for a big
fight. The Robert Reid class’s idea of being
madly progressive, not to say revolutionary,
would be to abolish all the taxes on itself, and
enact that nobody without property should
have a vote.
42 Days’ Solitary.
Judge Gaunt’s recent ferocious treatment of
prisoners at Melb. Sessions was outdone the
other day by an ordinary P.M. and a still more
commonplace J.P. They visited Pentridge
prison, and after lialf-an-hour’s necessanly-one-
sided “investigation” awarded certain con-
finees sentences of 9 months in irons for com-
mon assault on a fellow-prisoner; 7 days’
solitary for refusing to promptly obey an order ;
14 days’ solitary for taking part in a quarrel
which ended in a fight, and 42 days solitary (!)
in two instalments, for fighting as aforesaid.
This sentencing, after a mockery of a trial, of
prisoners by a couple of visiting magistrates is
a disgraceful travesty of justice. There is, of
course, no jury ; nor are there lawyers to cross-
examine; prisoner witnesses dare not say un-
pleasant things about officials who have them
at their mercy ; and the sentences are savage
in their ruthlessness, and such as the most
truculent Judge, even in Australia, would never
dare inflict in open court. Fancy any Judge—>
even Gaunt or Windeyer— awarding 9 months
in irons or 42 days’ solitary for common assault
—yet the casual P.M. possesses this power.
Moreover, this matter-of-fact magistrate pos-
sesses not only most comprehensive powers as
Judge, but he is jury as well, and there is nothing
to prevent him from acting as Crown Prosecutor
also, should he feel that way. Once again let
it he declared most emphatically that all
prisoners should be set fr ee at the expiration
of their original sentences, and then tried on
any additional charges in open court.
“Jack-Siiay ” on the steam-boiler question :
Dear Bulletin.— Be recent boiler explosions. Used to
work on a railway contractor’s ballast-train, and when
the engine had a stiff pinch to climb with a load the
practice was to screw down the valve and stoke up the
tire. Luckily the bnile-- stood it. Again, going down
Sydney Harbor recehi.i n a ferry-boat, we had a race
with another, and when she got ahead of us her people
ironically offered us a tow, to which replied our deck-
hand : “' Yah! we don’t have to sit on the safety-valve,
anyhow ! ” An important item of boiler inspection is
this safety-valve matter. An inspector, on ascertaining
a boiler’s safe working-pressure, should look-down and
seal the safety-valve to that limit, and it should be penal
for any other person to in any way meddle with the
valve except in inspector’s presence. What use to
examine a boiler to be worked at, say, i'fib. pressure if
an irresponsible person is at liberty to stoke her up to
80 or 100 ? A boiler may, at. 401 b., work a firewood-saw or
a chaff-cutter all right, but if transferred to a factory or
mill and fired up to 801 b. the chances may be all in favor
of a “bust..’’ What is wanted is regular inspection,
classification, and, where needed, condemnation of
boilers ; then, with the safety-valve regulated as sug-
gested, steam-boiler working wouldn’t be the horribly
risky business it so often is at present.
The acquittal of Driver Carter, of the Rakaia
railway butchery (M.L.), raises the question as
to the wisdom and justice of prosecuting rail-
way-drivers who come to smash. In any. rail-
way accident the chances are great that driver
and fireman will perish —most likely boiled or
roasted to death by escaping steam or burning
debris. So great is the chance that drivers and
firemen can be relied upon never to per-
petrate an accident for the fun of the thing, or
to see what it is really like. Their risk of this
hideous end is about 10 times that of passengers
or brakesmen, and the fact that, at Rakaia,
neither driver nor fireman was injured merely
proves that Rakaia was one of the exceptions
that prove the rule. Except those due
to drink, railway smashes are usually brought
about by a combination of adverse circum-
stances or an extraordinary combination of un-
likely circumstances, against which the ordinary
rules, checks, and regulations are powerless.
Then the Law steps in and tries for manslaughter
or criminal carelessness the official in charge,
because his single brain failed to cope in a
moment with a combination of events that the
whole well-thought-out and much-tested system
of checks and precautions had failed to prevent
after months or years of trial. Which strikes
the casual person as an asinine and unjust pro-
ceeding. When the captain of a steamer runs
his ship full-tilt into South Head lighthouse
instead of past it, no one dreams of prosecuting
him for manslaughter. A board of alleged
experts inquires into the case merely to decide
as to whether his certificate shall be cancelled
or not. But the railway-driver is not only
deprived of his certificate but, perhaps, his
liberty too. Why there should be so much dif-
ference between the captain of a ship and the
captain of a train is not clear : the Law is un-
equal as well as unjust.
Thus a Bulletin interrogator :
The boss importers of Japanese labor at Thursday
Island supported the Labor candidate for the Cook last
election against Hamilton, the Govt. Whip ; and further,
all the Kanaka shopkeepers in Mackay—the very men
who live on the “cheap and reliable”—supported the
Labor and Opposition candidates against the two Minis-
ters —Dalrymplk and Ohataway. The above are incon-
trovertible facts, and I would like to hear what The Bul-
letin has to say about them.
In reply : No existing records show whether
the Labor and Opposition candidates referred
to were really white, yellow, or black, and in
the absence of such evidence, and in the face of
alleged “ incontrovertible facts,” we can only
inquire : Who supported the successful Govt,
candidates? Who, if not those interested in
the slave-traffic, desire to perpetuate the colored
alien-labor curse? Election results, in some
parts of Queensland— notably Cairns—show,
not that those “ who live on the cheap and re-
liable ” want their bread removed, but that
there is a growing number who can live without,
and desire to live without, the imported colored
alien.
♦
The Freetrade Argus has discovered a new
sinfulness in Protection for the Vic. woollen
trade :
Members of the Naval Brigade have to pay for their
uniforms, and it appears that a pure wool fabric would
cost more than they are now paid for their services. The
department could import a woollen fabric of the Quality
used in the Imperial Navy free of duty, and sell it to the
corps at not more than the cost of the clothing now
worn, but, as a matter of policy is involved, the Minister
of Defence will have to give it careful consideration. . . .
There is a way of escape. It is to order the all-wool
clothino- here, and to call upon the taxpayers to make
up the* difference in cost. As to farmers and toilers
generally—as to ordinary citizens and their womankind
and their children—they will not get all wool as they
might do, but they must, be content with shoddy.
Also, they must be content with the knowledge
that the Victorian woollen mills are going
ahead of late, and the local article gets cheaper
and more woolly, and furnishes more employ-
ment, every year, and the alleged extra ex-
pense incurred by putting the Naval Brigade
into togs that will not “ readily burn, with
disastrous results to the corps as the
result of any accident in action, will
not drive the taxpayer to insolvency.
Moreover, if the taxpayer didn’t tax himself on
his imported woollens and thereby get some
revenue while furnishing himself with some
employment at the same time he would have to
tax himself on something else to make up the
shortage and perhaps not get the employment.
And the country has only the Argus’s word
for it that the imported woollen, apart from
the duty, is dearer than the locally-manufac-
tured woollen. What is the Argus’s word
worth —does anybody know ? And, by the
way, the woollen “ used in the Imperial Navy
isn’t pure woollen after all. It is very much
like the stuff that all the row is about, and the
Argus savs it’s the same price.

g A lr ®l awn y °t the Wells” opened fire at
Sydney Royal on Saturday, with Mrs. Brough out
r for /’ rst tln *e this season. The
g of ‘ he Pfo-toP trousers, pork-pie hats, crino-
knes and walnut furniture reached this country
long ago without any marked allusions to the play
itself, and this scribe went to the Royal on Satur-
day in the belief that there was going to be no
play to speak of under wide expanses of crinoline.
A good deal of “Trelawny’s” success is cer-
tainly due to its costume and atmosphere, but
on its own merits the fine play grasps the affec-
tions and keeps a tight hold on them there-
after. Ihe plot tells how pretty Rose Trelawnv
a favorite actress at the Wells Theatre, leaves the
stage and the company that worships the hem of
her gown unanimously, to marry Arthur Gower
grandson of a terrible old Vice-Chancellor. Before
the knot is finally tied, Rose puts up a visit at
this old party s house, and meets Arthur’s rela-
tives and is never allowed to talk to Arthur alone
and dwells m the odour of respectability until, one
an k , s *T aln * , " Colues t°o great for endurance,
.he breaks the traces, and sits on a hassock and
sings a song, and otherwise upsets the sanctity of
a rep and walnut drawing - room where every-
one is expected to get to sleep behind a
newspaper immediately after dinner. And then
she breaks off her engagement with Arthur’s
grandfather and grand-aunt and Arthur himself
fi .? oes back to the stage, and finds herself too
ladylike to be a favorite any longer. And, just
when things are very black and bad, who should
walk in but Arthur’s grandfather, in blue trousers
and a shawl over his coat, come to inquire after
the missing Arthur. Very cleverly and humanly,
Uinero here churns-up recollections of Keane in
the old man s breast, and there follows an affec-
tfonately-acted passage, wherein the godly old
Vice-Chancellor finds himself showing Rose how
Keane used to do it. After that the happy ending
begins to show itself, and the Vice-Chancellor
turns fairy godmother to everybody in need of the
commodity, and Trelawny is thrown into Arthur’s
arms again, and Lovell never tells his love for
I relawny, and the shadow of his untold affection
casts a soft melancholy over the otherwise common-
place end of the story.
The part of Rose Trelawny falls to Grace
JNoble, who is pretty and sentimental enough to
account for all the adoration lavished on her. The
only fault to be found with Miss Noble’s earnest
charming acting is her sneeze, which resembles’
a sunrise assisted by several local barnyards
Brough scores another big success as the terrible
old party in a top-hat and a grey shawl Ever
since Ins return Brough has been playing with
exceptional ardour and smartness (leaving out
Napoleon Lroughaparte), but his Sir William ex-
cels all his other good work. Pretty Miss Hanley
is afraid to be ancient enough to be Brough’s old
sister Percy Brough fills Arthur Gower out
with the correctly sawny stuffing for the hero, but
the realhero is Loved, w ho looks like Nicholas
Nickleby, and p ays with a fine, restrained touch.
Mr. Giutton silhouettes a lisping captain with
side-levers ; he is married to Winifred Austin
who looks pretty, and does her very little nicely.’
Mario Majerom shines luminously in the “ fat ”
part of a stagey actor. Reginald Dartrey makes
a conscientious study of an old ’GO actor, and Miss
Bessie Thompson puts a lot of experienced acting
into Mrs. Telfer. Miss Emma Temple revels freely
m Avoma Bunn. Miss Vara Renny shies timidly at
her part of Imogen Parrot, an 1 rants rather badly
whenever a rant offers. Miss Evelyn Martheze’s
oarah and Mr. Victor’s Charles are two very well-
played slaveys. In the rest of the long caste
several colorless people have got in by mistake!
but on the whole, “1 relawny” is carefully played
ail through, and is highly recommended to anyone
who has no objection to being reminded of his
past—particularly her past.

„ tllere is any artistic justice in this world
Sardou’s “Flesh and the Devil ” should fill
Sydney Criterion for several weeks. The' Flesh
which ns Miss Ldian Wheeler,, is very charming )
and the Devil, which is Harry Diver is-an in
terestmg fiend with the glare of the Pit shin-
ing beneath his shaggy eyebrows. They move
among the picturesque surroundings, and long l
swords, and baggy trunk hose, and big grey
cathedrals of Flanders m the time of Alva and
11 t le Silent—Flanders as it was when kind
old Margaret of Parma had taken her gouty toe
back m disgust to Spain, and the Beggars of the
Sea were organising, and the reign of plain
butchery had commenced. It is a tragic story.
The Flesh is the wife of Count de Rysoor, patriot
and conspirator, but she loves him not, possibly
on account of his massive legs, and gives herself
instead to his friend Van der Hoot, who is also a
patriot and conspirator, though the lady isn’t
aware of it. And when she fathoms the con-
spiracy a great idea comes to her—that she will
give away the insurrectionists, and the patriot
with the stout supports and all his companions
will perish, and she, being widowed, will marry
her Van der Hoot and live happily ever after
Therefore, the Flesh goes by night to the Devil’
and unknowingly gives away her lover, and there
are tortures and burnings, and wholesale and
retail slaughter, and innumerable horrors. But at
the la it the I lesh, by strong and intense grovel at
the feet of the Devil, obtains her lover’s pardon
and he promptly uses his liberty to execute the
wonmn who sold him to Alva, and kills himself
with her. The last of his friends are just then
being burnt m the square outside, and the odor of
tried friend had probably turned his brain.
* • * *
Therefore there is no more Flesh, and
only the Devil remains, and as his daughter, the
one thing dear to his horny soul, is dying, even he
is Jett miserable. The story is a great, picturesque
tragedy, and on the whole the company does it
tair Miss Lilian Wheeler is very charm-
ing as the Flesh—charming in a swift, eager, dia-
bolical sort of way—and the audience feels sorry
tor her end. Harry Diver is the Devil, which is
the JJuke of Alva, and his conception of that
bowelless soldier with the forked beard seems just
what he might have been if he looked like his
character. T lie boss patriots are only moderately
satisfactory Johnson Weir knows his part per-
tectly but struggles with it in rather an ungrace-
ful fashion, and George Rignold scorns make-up
and appears always as the same G.R. till the
public is perhaps a trifle weary. But most of the
parts are well filled. Charles Field and sundry
other [Spanish officers, who hustle the Nether-
landers off to execution and attend to hangings,
a ]?d dislocations, are very satisfactory ;
and Miss Maude Whyte, as the Duke’s daughter,
seems a young lady of promise.
* * * *
And there are situations in the play which
even the most ungraceful Fleming couldn’t spoil.
Ferhaps tne best is where the conspirators are
trapped in the courtyard of Brussels town hall,
having been betrayed by the Flesh; and the Devil
in his gorgeous suit, and his hungry forked beard,
and his burning eyes, looks down on them from
the balcony and passes sentence of death with
trimmings, that scene should keep the “Flesh
and the Devil ” going for some weeks.

Harry Conor, remembered as the healthy
dying invalid who was worn to a thick shadow in
Xrip to Chinatown,” and his new American co.,
and ins new American musical sketchedy, appeared
at Her Majesty’s (Sydney) on Saturday night.
Arthur Facie, one of the two broad, placid
beaming middle-aged men who used to be so
much alike in “Chinatown,” is also with the show •
otherwise the people are new, or mostly so. The
play, “A Stranger in New York,” is new. It
is suggestive of “ Chinatown '’ and skim-water.
Both plays commence with a man singing a sonf
to another man. They both include the tottering
old man who ambles after the girls ; and that
great American joke, the divorced woman, in
short skirts, who is a good fellow and drinks with
tne boys ; and they both consist of some men and
a crowd of girls in brief frocks going to a ball.
JHe Stranger lags grievously on the stage. It
is a long, long time between jokes, and the jokes
rage very moderately when they arrive. In the
beginning there is a lone pilgrim in a New York
hotel—ajidgnm whose anguished cry for cocktail
fills the passages and halls and shakes the naked
stone figger on its pedestal. Also there is a
mistake about a letter of- ; introduction, whereby
the stranger is invited to the ball instead of the
sad wooden man with the side-whiskers and the
prim plug-hat. And when the ball has spread
through two acts, the sad man’s wife trios to
capture him, but owing to the error which mixed
up his identity he escapes. This wouldn’t matter
in itself, for the plot of the American allegedly
musical tinngrimbob is only a framework whereon
to hang the irrelevant variety show, and if the
variety show is bright and vigorous nothing else
signifies much.
* * * *
But the “ Stranger ” is bald of song and
scarce of dance, and the cheerful irrelevant incident
is not tnere, and the hair of mirth has fallen off its
desolate cranium. A great deal too much of the
time there are four people sitting on one side of
the stage, and four more on the other, and one
person singing in the centre. Some of the new
people sing badly, and some of them dance
worse, and when the members of the co. vio-
mntly applaud each other it is too much.
Harry Conor is the best humorist of the show ;
Ins fun consists largely in rushing violently about
on two condensed legs; but in addition to being
an old man in a hurry he contrives to always look
happy, and he often rushes other people into
teelmg the same way. At other times he doesn’t
give them time to realise that they don’t feel the
same way. It is a very poor song which doesn’t
sound pleasant when the bright little man with
the beaming legs sings it. The rest of the people
have one great joke among them : that is, when a
man informs the health department that another
man has the plague, and the other man is fumi-
gated by the whole strength of the law. Arthur
Facie helps things out with a very creditable
Shying voice; and Misses Allene Crater and
Madelene Lack deserve mention for two bright
faces and four graceful legs, though the legs might
dance to better purpose. But the “Stranger,”
taken all round, is one of the poorest musical
comedies which ever struck this country, and the
?y? rages about third-rate. Why anyone
should nave troubled to bring such very ordinary
material so far passes comprehension.
** * *
In the holy calm of Saturday night there
a e c ? l } l £ one chan ff e of programme in Sydney
A Soldier and a Man ” at the Lyceum beinff
succeeded by “The Merciless World.” For the
last two weeks Frank Hawthorne has succeeded
to William Gourlay s old part in the “ Soldier and
Man —the part of the thin but faithful retainer
who sells his waistcoat to buy one square meal of
steak for his young mistress, his young master
being so far gone m drink that he hasn’t brought
home any steak for five years. Mr. Hawthorne
? ai ? a & 01 ™ bly 5 his otll y disadvantage
is that he lacks the intense thinnesss of his prede-
cessor. A man who has to sell his weskit for food
ought to be thin, and a greyhound is a bloated
rtoman emperor by comparison with Mr. Gourlay.
** * *
. The Bulletin can only offer a confused
impression of M’Adoo’s “Georgia Minstrels and
Alabama Cake-Walkers.” These bounding black
brethren and sistern appeared at Sydney Palace
on Saturday night in a kind of inky frenzy and
crape hurricane, and it will take some time to sort
them out. The little theatre hadn’t a vacant seat,
and the crowd swarmed into the back premises
three deep. The Bulletin man arrived late, and
was crushed by enthusiasts who arrived still later.
Over the heads of a loud and flattened multitude
he saw some things that he approved of greatly,
but in the crush he couldn’t tell one cake-walker
from another, and his feet were stood on by many
people besides hin iself, and two hats got into his
eye. So he decided to go more deeply into par-
ticulars next week.
** * *
Curtis, the American gentleman who came
here with Dante, is importing an American octo-
roon company and brass band of coloured brethren
and team of “ cake-walkers ’’—The Bulletin has
often heard of cake-walkers, but it is still hungering
for information about them —which opens in
Sydney on Ist July.

“The Gu v’nor,” now in possession of
Sydney Opera House, is a musical farce with nice
scenery and dressing, in which Mr. Butterscotch
is led by the cracked voice of Mr. Jellicoe in the
next garden and by sundry traces of secret love-
ineetings between his daughter Kate and Theodore
Macclesfield to suspect his wife Aurelia of having
a tame poodle. Aurelia is young and pretty and
Mr. Butterscotch is old and unromantic and very
jealous. He sets to work to track the poodle to
his lair. Act 2 shows the lair, the home of Mr.
Macclesfield, senr., an ancient and deaf boat-
builder without a scrap of romance or intrigue in
him. Freddy Butterscotch, who stutters horribly,
wants to marry Carrie Macclesfield, but the deaf
old man persists in selling him a yacht and
declares she II be all right when she gets her paint
on. Mother and Carrie shout and scream into
Dad Mac’s ear that it is the girl and not the boat
that is required, and just as the stony one grasps
the fact Butterscotch, senr., bursts in with a mis-
understanding in each hand, and accuses the
ancient, barrel-like salt of alienating his wife’s
affections. And the barrel-like one, having been
told by his family at the top of their voices that
he is to say “ Yes,” says all the “ Yes ” that is in
him. But after a while a great light breaks in on
Butterscotch and melts him, and the curtain
comes down on eight people kissing each other
enthusiastically. And the boat-building parent,
oblivious to the last, ascribes all their joy to an
intense desire on everybody’s part to buy a boat.

On Saturday night the large, chronic Tivoli
audience leant forward and inclined its large red
ear to hear music and songs rendered six weeks
ago in New York, which Jimmy McMahon poured
out of the “ Perfected Phonograph.” Brass-band
strains from the Phono, sound screechy, but banjo
and vocal music comes out splendidly. One
unbelieving Thomas was heard to declare that the
banjo item was Mr. Hosea Easton “back beyant.”
After that Mr. and Mrs. Valdares gyrated on the
stage on bicycles. They rode backwards and
forwards ; sometimes the lady rode on her com-
panion’s shoulders, sometimes lying full length
across the handles in front of him, with an easy
grace that proved how wonderfully easy it is to
be eloped with on a bike. Then Mr. V. lay down on
the bike with his feet over the handles and drove
the machine with his hands. When the audience
started to stamp the place down both V. ’s came back
with the machine in two pieces, and each flew
round and round on one wheel only. The Valdares
are a mildly staggering item, but that is all.

“ Aletes ” sends The Bulletin “an out-
sider’s comments on some recent pianists ” :
Friedenthal is the masculine counterpart of Elsie
Hall -Adela Verne, the feminine ditto of Hambourg (with
reservations). The cultured young Australian gave us
musical expression refined to an almost ethereal degree.
The nervous delicacy of Chopin, the glowing, graceful
fancy of Schunian, found herein a charming exponent.
Power, however, seemed lacking wherever power was re-
quired. One’s soul was lifted into a dreamy cioudland,
but the gossamer webs that, sustained it were 100 frail to
last. In Friedenthal one found similar qualities with a
desirable accession of strength. Here was a broader in-
sight, a more human interest add an admirably diversified
capacity. Yet, fine an artist as he was, something lacked.
The rugged genius of Beethoven seems to have baffled
him—just a little. In the immortal sonatas (to the
ambitious pianist the ultima thule of interpretative
power, his Romeo, Othello, and Hamlet) one missed—at
least, the writer did—that simple richness allied to subtle
intensity which permeates nearly all the work of the
great German. A partial failure only, but disappointing.
In Hambourg we had the apotheosis of technique, the
climax of the dynamic. One followed the movements of
Mark with the breathless expectation that greets the
breaker of records. Hence, perhaps, his popularity in
Australia. Unqualified, however, this criticism is unjust
For I he first Hambourg promised the better things after-
wards realised by the second, and the promise itself has
been bettered. For there were hints of the slumbering
artist within, gleams of blue through the storm-clouds
But Adela Verne was the truest artist of them all. With
finer strength than Miss Hall, more subtlety than
Friedenthal, deeper reverence than Hambourg, there was
in her, what lacked more or less in the rest of the quar-
tette, a quiet delicate vein of humor that colored and
warmed all her work. Her concerts have left the most
memorable impressions. The magnetic little lady should
have a bright future.

Unless Melbourne is incapable of taking
respectful interest in the pomps and circumstances
and crimson plush “rationals” of a way-back
Erench period, “The King’s Musketeer ” should
play a long innings at the Princess’s. Henry
Hamilton’s adaptation of Dumas’ romance is an
exciting entertainment in one or two places; for
the rest it contains much action, gorgeous gar-
niture, picturesque grouping, and fatal duel.
Dramatist Hamilton aimed at making his work
intelligible to the large majority who have never
read Dumas’ yarn, and the bulk of that majority
will be able to understand where the motives of
the stage characters come in.
* * * «
The drama shows a well-marked hero,
newly-arrived in Paris, forming a natural alliance
with the three musketeers, and a mashful
acquaintance with Gabrielle, the Queen’s maid-of-
honor. The stream of D’Artagnan’s adventures
flows easily most of the time. He and his girl
love, move, and have their being in a fairly real-
istic way. They are associated in only one very
unnatural scene, and that is when D’Artagnan
comes in a violent hurry to the Hotel de Ville,
bearing the diamond studs that are wanted
immediately, and proceeds to waste precious
moments by spinning a long, descriptive narrative
to Gabrielle, who listens instead of telling her hero
to cut it short and hand over the goods. Barring
this foolishness, the happy pair give no cause for
complaint. Miladi, on the other hand, appears as
a purposeless plotter in the early scenes. Her
wicked past is not perceptibly linked to her pre-
sent mystery, and the fact that Athos hanged her
from a tree m days of yore- because he discovered
the felon’s brand on her shoulder almost commends
Miladi to the sympathy of a birth-stained coun-
try, whose earliest squatter got sent out for shoot-
ing a hare. The audience i,s not stirred by the
uncertain dame of intrigue ■ ntil she figures in her
nightdress, in the fourth act, and even then her
exciting struggle with D’Artagnan arises from the
oldest and holiowest of stage tricks, for she is sup-
posed not to know the difference between the
voice and hug of the man she loves and the fellow
she hates. But her death in the next act is a fine
dramatic opportunity, and the actress uses it for
all it is worth.
* * * *
Miss Henrietta Watson here takes rank
among the few convincing tragediennes who have
attempted great things in this country. Sarah
Bernhardt would make a more magnetic effect
in the same scene, but she couldn’t be more
thoroughly artistic. Miss Watson’s vivid repre-
sentation of terror at her approaching doom, the
appeals to her husband, the sudden taking of the
poison and rapid convulsive manner of passing
hence in great agony—all these things are weil
and truly done. Evidently the Miss Henrietta
Watson who left us three or four years ago ha-;
gained a lot of dramatic force whilst adding a few
pounds to her acting weight; also absence has
made her voice grow rounder and sweeter. Cecil
Ward is a cheerful, satisfactory D’Artagnan in a
small way. He doesn’t realise the Gascon that
Dumas created, but there is positively no reason
for considering Dumas in the matter. Miss Emity
Hughes plays the pretty part of Gabrielle with 'a
nice light touch for the most part, and Mi s
Raymond, as the Queen, is a stilted imitation of
Miss Eerrar when she isn’t imitating Mrs.
Potter or somebody else. Plimmer, Augustus
Glover and George Majeroni are not out of place
in the clothes of the three musketeers. Plimmer
(as Athos) comes out strong in the scene of
Miladi s downfall; and Miss Watson’s triumph
owes a little to his quiet impressiveness at this
crisis. Two other important characters the
King and Cardinal Richelieu—are mistaken by
Harry Hill and W. P. Hawtrey. Hill’s perform-
ance is weaker than Hawtrey’s, in a pictorial
sense, the Cardinal’s gown being less undignified
than His Majesty’s legs. However, “ The King’s
Musketeer ” can be forgiven a lot of poor acting
in detail for the sake of its general splendor and
“go.”

At Melb. Royal, the water-picnic will sit
down upon the unsuspecting bloater for the last
time on Friday, and on Saturday another melo-
drama will fill the vasty stage. Bland Holt’s next
item carries the title of “Straight from the
Heart,” and Miss Elizabeth Watson is understood
to own the heart in question. Sister Henrietta is
so glaringly wicked just at present that Miss
Elizabeth probably desires to act as a sort of
family antidote by appearing as the dear, good
girl who prefers death to dishonor.

Peggy Pryde’s final outbreak at the Bijou
will conclude with a farewell matinee on Saturday
next, but the blow of her departure for ’Oine is to
be softened by the production of Tom and Lily
English to-night (Thursday). The male English
is described as a musical comedian, and the lady
has a character for blowing the cornet and whistling
hke an angel. Cinquevalli will be leaving for
Sydney on the same day, with the solemn words
of a Melb. surgeon ringing unheeded in his ear.
The surgeon has informed the local press that
Cinque’s caimon ball will “one day rupture a
small blood-vessel in the spinal canal ” and close,
as a paralytic, his remarkable career. Scherek's
orchestral concert at the Town Hall next Satur-
day is to include Miss Elsie Hall in a Chopin con-
certo.

At Brisbane Opera House, the Hellers
extended their season into this week, owing
partly to several thousand people wanting to find
out how Heller produced a gorgeous supper with
oigars and fizz ’ to follow, out of some empty
drain-pipes, and partly to Madame’s defiance of the
proprieties in riding her bike around the sta<m
head-downward. Still more disciples of thrift
rolled up to see the just retribution upon the
lady m rags who. was burnt because she refused
to make her pile in one act, when requested to do
so by a gentlemanly demon who had money to
burn- They retired to make room for the “ Belle
of N York and the man who was “ bitten be-
the drawing-room and the conservatory.”
The “Belle ” had a record house on Monday night
and Uncle Pete shaved the back of his neck to
make room for his smile, which now overflows his
features and goes right down his back.

People complain more than ever of the un-
necessary boredom inflicted upon them at
Rickards’s. They don’t find much fault with the
Tirst Part, m which none of the items are long
and some of the singing is satisfactory, but they
would like to know why the Second Part of the
programme should be dragged out to 11 o’clock or
thereabouts by the* system of allowing three
“ turns ” to performers who are only good for one,
or two at the most. Horace Wheatley was a case
in point; Shields, the one-legged man, is another
grievance. The public are expected to overlook a
couple of preliminary songs from Shields for the
sake of the third ditty, that has a droll dance
attached to it. Then there is James C. Bain —
three helpings of that laborious “comique”are
more than enough. What Rickards needs is a
huge, muscular stage-manager, who would use his
own discretion in pruning the programme, and
cut out the poor stuff, when it is very poor, ’with
out regard for the feelings of anybody, save tli
audience in front. Also, there is a growing de
mand for the partial suppression of Pope° anc
Sayles—especially Sayles.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Some fool of a cable contrived to supply all the
Australian newspapers with wrong- information about the
s'ate of the Tasmanian rev enue for May, and accused that
province of showing a decline, whereas it really had a
substantial improvement. The month’s figures should
have read

and so far as the accounts are available, the various pro-
vinces show as follows :

Some intelligence by mail also seems to imply
that the cable made a ghastly mess of an item about the
Maoriland surplus for last financial year (to 31st March,
1899), and that the receipts for the 12 months exceeded
the expenditure by £327,917. But at the moment this
paper is too full of language about cable intelligence in
general to go into this.
* * * *
Westralia still continues to cut down its expen-
diture. For May the revenue was £204,509, and the ex-
penditure £191,985. For the 11 months of the finan-
cial year up to 31st May, revenue was £2,202,254,
and expenditure £2,296,977 ; deficit, £94,723. The total
deficit now grows smaller every month, hut Forrest didn’t
start cutting down expenditure until too late, and there
is hardly time to screw out a surplus nmv. At the end of
May things stood thus with the three provinces whose
expenditure accounts were available :
Queensland (11 months) Surplus .. £793,264
Westralia ( ~ ) Deficit .. 94,723
N.S.W. ( „ ) „ .. 147,746

S.A. State Bank has just purchased new and
capacious offices in Adelaide, and the purchase-money
came out of accumulated profits. This is the institution
which S. A. Tories prophesied would close its doors as a
gigantic failure within five years.
* * * *
Westralia has novv achieved the proud position
of being (on paper) the province whose credit stands
highest in the London loan-market; it pays a-n average of
13 10s. lOd. per cent, per annum on it.s public debt, while
N.S.W. pays £3 12s. 10d., Queensland £3 15s. 10d., Tas-
mania £3 16s. od., Victoria £3 17s. 7d., Maoriland
£3 17s. lOd. and S.A. 13 18s. sd. Which only goes to
show that things are not what they seem, and never were.
As a matter of fact it is often the province which has
borrowed most furiously, anti got nearest to the work-
house, whose credit looks best when judged in this
fashion. It was in ’95 that 3 per cent, loans were first
floated by these provinces. If, before that date, two
provinces of equally good credit had owed £20,000,000
each, all at 4 per cent., their average interest would
obviously be 4 per cent. And then if one borrowed an
additional £40,000,000, at 3 per cent, while the other
borrowed nothing, the one province would owe £60,000,000
at an average of £3 6s. Bd. per cent, interest, while the
other would owe £20,000,000 at an average of 4 per cent.
And on paper the credit of the province which was mak-
ing the fastest sprint towards insolvency would look very
much the better of the two. That’s what’s the matter
with W.A.
* * * •
When Bigjohn Forrest tried his famous experi-
ment at restricting the outflow of money from W. A., he
put up the price of a £6 p.o. order on Adelaide from 2s.
to 4s. And he didn’t notice, until the trade was
practically lost, that the banks were doing the same busi-
ness for thirteenpence. Now Bigjohn has gone back to
the old 25., hut the public, having found out the cheap-
ness of the bank rate (most people didn’t know it before)
won’t do business even at that price.

It was in 1894 that Maoriland passed the famous
Conciliation and Arbitration Act, which was to wreck its
industries, and make the manufacturer take up his engine
and boiler under one arm, and his tall factory chimney
under the other, and quit in disgust. And the number of
hands employed in Maoriland factories has been : 1894,
25,851 ; 1895, 29,879 ; 1896, 32,387 ; 1897, 36,918 ; 1898,
39,672. No other province comes within telescope range
of this remarkable increase, effected under the combined
influences of heavy Protection and Socialistic Govern-
ment.

The London Bank of Australia, in its report
for ’9B, shows a considerable improvement. The situation,
as compared with that of some previous years, is as
follows:
31st December, 1891 (year) Profit .. £104,437
„ 1892 („ ) „ .. 71,643
~ 1893 (5 months) ~ .. 5,987
The other seven months’ profits were written off at the
1893 reconstruction.
30th June, 1894 (6 months) Profit .. £7,026
31st December, 1894 ( ~ ) » •• 8,216
30th June, 1895 ( „ ) » •• 7,082
31st December, 1895 ( ~ ) ~ .. 5,6/3
30th June, 1896 ( „ ) Loss .. 231
31st December, 1896 ( ~ ) ~ .. 4,396
„ 1897 (year) ~ .. 8,124
„ 1898 (~ ) Profit .. 10,885 _
The London Bank still pays the full 4£ per cent, on its
reconstructed deposits as agreed on in 1893; the best
terms the British Parliament would allow when its Re-
reconstruction Bill came before that aggressively honest in-
stitution in ’97, being that not more than l£ per cent, of
the interest could stand over. In the second half of 1897
the bank allowed £8152 of arrears to accumulate, but
they have all b.een wiped off out of the 1898 profit, and it
starts fair with a balance of £4572 at credit of profit and
loss. And 1899 is likely to be better in the way of profit
than 1893. In 1893, when the first reconstruction took
place, the London Bank had £5,800,000 of deposits on which
it agreed to pay per cent. The amount was reduced at
the end of 1898 to £3,189,098, but certain further repay-
ments which are to be made this year will bring the total
down to £2,282,477. The saving of interest involved in
these repayments should make things look up a good deal
with the London.
In spite of these improved prospects, however,
the management discovers that heroic measures are re-
quired to put the institution on its feet again. There-
ore it has been decided to write off £lO a share of
paid up capital (£491,030), and £13,455 at credit of 897
forfeited shares. This makes a writing-off of £504,485,
and it makes the total writing-off since 1893 no less than
£1 122 000. It will leave a paid-up capital of £908,475
,(£736,545 ordinary and £171,930 preference). The profits
for 1898 are only equal to £1 3s. lid. even on this reduced
amount, so the prospects of the ordinary shareholders in
.the immediate future are very poor. They don't even
begin to get a show until as* “^^^tfgive^he

At the half-yearly meeting of the West Aus-
tralian Bank a shareholder at last phicked up courage to
suggest that the accounts should be audited, }v. A.
Bank is 58 years old and has never possessed an auditor.)
He added that, of course, it wasn’t necessary ; with such a
capable and irreproachable class of men in charge Uie
unaudited balance-sheet was beyond suspicion but as a
concession to outsiders who didn t know the abs flute
purity of W.A. businessmen a formal overhaul seemed
advisable. But what the W.A. Bank wants isn t a
friendly formal overhaul by any local person ; no local
person dare overhaul the stupendous magnates of the
WA Bank properly. The 58 years arrears of washing
make it advisable that the work should be done by some-
one to whom the wrath of every influential business man
in Westralia matters not a pm. No wise accountant in
little Perth would dare to tell the awful truth (if there is
any awful truth to tell) about the bank management of
the people who practically own the country, and the mere
idea is suggestive of a cockroach auditing the Almighty.
If the West Australian Bank proposes to make a new
departure it should import two big accountants from
Melbourne or Sydney to make the first overhaul and give
the institution a clean bill of health.

S A Insolvency Court, making its inquiry 2i
years long into the affairs of the once-big firm of Harrold
Bros., found that a profit had been made in only one year
between 1884 and 1896. The losses in that tune amounted
to £112,475. ,
N.S.W. Examiner of Patents has ruled against
the proposed amendment of the cyanide patent; so did
the Vic. Examiner, but the cyanide people won in the
end. Notice of appeal in N.S.W. has been given. W riter
predicts that the dispute will end in Govt, giving for the
use of the process a sum less than that already wasted in
law. Maoriland set the example two years ago.

Thu Bulletin office often has a lot of ore in
sight, and though the practice of sending it in has never
been encouraged, this paper receives too many requests
for gratuitous assays and opinions as to value and treat-
ment of samples'submitted. Arrangements have now
been made for testing, by assay and otherwise, samples of
ore provided the sum of £1 is sent with each to cover
cost. Assays alone do not serve the miner’s purpose,
hence certificates supplied to Bulletin correspondents,
will not only give a statement of metallic contents
owners will be advised by an experienced, practical metal-
lurgist as to the best methods of treating the ore in bulk,
whether by wet or dry crushing and amalgamation, smelt-
ing, cyaniding, chlorinating, etc. Parcels should not be
less than lib. nor more than 101 b.
Lake George mines, N.S.W. Another fall in
ore-values, followed bv a market slump. Value per ton
of last month’s output, 28s. Id. ; total cost, 235. id. per
ton. In addition, £522 came from precipitates. Output,
5339 tons ; approximate profit, £l2OO. Shares dropped
tolls. They were nearly double three weeks ago. Have
again risen 'to 20s. London buyers coming forward.
Either a mystery somewhere, or many fools in Bull-land.

Negotiations have begun for the transfer of
B.H. Water Supply’s works from the co. to the local
Council. The co.’s directors invite an offer—which, of
course, the Council can’t make until it knows whether the
Govt, will advance the money. *
From the smellful and Sunday-boomed North
Nymagee (N.S.W.) : “ The ore is worth 40 per cent, (cop-
per) now patchv in face. Going strong underfoot; face
looking well. Average value of ore body 5 per cent.”
Now how much sense is there in all this? Within the
last ten days many thousands of these shares have
changed hands. Within three days of the announcement
of “ a discovery ” 17,000 forfeited shares were sold for Id.
each —and they increased in market price 36 times in 36
hours. An official explanation is promised. • Another
wire from mine : “Grey ore patchy and irregular ; car-
bonates showing back and face; anticipate improve-
ment.” One never hears of anything poorer being antici-
pated. A market improvement, anyhow, was probably
anticipated by someone when 17,000 shares, now worth
nearly £BOOO, were got under the hammer for £7O
16s. Bd. !! ! North Nymagees (the flotation of the mine
was a characteristically-N.S.VV. reach-out) were once
boomed up to about 13s. *
“Galling Gallymont.” Some “nice” things
told under this heading by London Critic. “ The leases
were made out to be dirt-cheap at £225,000, the price put
on them by the Anglo-Australian Exploration Co., Ltd.”
Writer wonders what the A.A.E. paid for them? The
flotation was largely assisted by the Gibraltar Consoli-
dated, whose shares were then at a premium ; how at a
big discount. Again the Critic : “To he quite candid,
the whole thing is a dismal fiasco, and as the shares are
only worth Is. a-piece, holders may as well make up their
minds to write the whole thing off as a totally bad debt.”
News like this must make some people in Sydney squirm.

The Westralian goldfields are. getting quite
aged. Here is a co., the Fraser’s, issuing its “ majority ”
report—it was formed 10£ years ago. Unfortunately
prospects are so poor that, though a hare profit has been

likely buyer. Still it is by no means bad work th *re to
even make ends meet, while doing a lot of prospecting, on

The curse of British capital, and the curse of a
timid Government which is afraid of offending British
capital, and whose whole existence is one long apology to
British capital, crawl like long, sad worms over all the
prospects of Westralia. The coil industry is a case in
point. W.A. has a number of promising coalfields, one of
them being at Collie. It is on a railway line, not much
over 100 miles from Perth, and comparatively close to the
sea at Bunburv. Coal is a heavy substance, and costs a
lot in freight; Westralia’s next neighbor, S.A., has prac-
tically none of it; Victoria doesn’t supply enough for its
own consumption, and N.S.W. is a long way off —so far off
that freight alone gives the local article a long start.
Westralia might supply itself, and S.A. as well, and it
wants a new industry badly. But of the five big
coal-leases at Collie three, covering over 13,000
acres, are not working at all. They have no output of
coal and they have one man working among them,
whereas, by the terms of the Act, they should be em-
ploying 670. A fourth eo., with 4732 acres, employs 20
men instead of the 237 required by law, and turns out 60
tons of coal weekly. Only one mine out of the five is
working in real earnest, and its output is 1500 tons
weekly. The Government wants to find work for the
people, and these other four lessees are pledged to em-
ploy nearly 900 men more than they are doing ; also, it
wants to stop the outflow of money, and £70,000 a year
is going out needlessly for coal. But the scared and
wormy Government of Bigjohn dare not make any co. or
syndicate fulfi' -he terms of its bargain. It is afraid of
offending “B. .dsh capital.” So the companies refuse to
work the Collie ooal-leases themselves, and they prevent
anyone else working them, and the Forrest Ministry does
nothing.

Tindal’s, Ooolgardie, placed under offer. De-
posit (£250) to be returned if an additional ten head is
erected. Option, nine months. Price, £3OOO and a sixth
interest. Better than making calls without prospect of

Golden Horseshoe, W.A., is controlled in Lon-
don and largely owned in Paris. Latest quote, £5O, which
represents a value of five millions. Production over
8000 oz. monihly—average nearly 4oz. per ton. Ore very
rich at bottom of shaft ; said to be worth 20oz. at 460 ft.
Shares believed to be pooled if not cornered, and specu-
lators are advised in London not to be tempted to “ bear”
them, as they would be at the mercy of certain operators.
Would also be well to remember that the G.H. is in its first
year’s production, and that in the Boulders, Lake Views,
and other great mines thereabouts the average per ton
was greater the first year than the second, and the second
greater than the third. Averages fall with time and ton-
nage all the world over. This mine was practically given
away by the Golden Link Consolidated, and the areas they
kept have so far proved of little value.
A W.A. mine that looks like coining again is
Bayley’s. Big money spent in good development work
anil improved plant. Shares doubled in value, and average
assays for last week 30dwt. Strange if there aren’t some
good shoots left in the enormous ore-body traversing the
ground.

The Konemann inilling-plant is being converted
into a plant for cyaniding under a new system, and is “ to
be used as a stop-gap until the filter presses arrive.” Was
any gold got by the Konemann process ? If so—how
much ? The silence of Boulder directors in this shady
business is simply appalling.
* « * *
Be the big W.A. producers— calculating obser-
vers must have noticed the insignificance of the divs.
paid by some of these mines compared with their enor-
mous gold-yields and phenomenal market values. The
Associated is the most incomprehensible of all. It pro-
duced last year over £350,000 in gold, and paid—one div.
of ss. Many thousands have been expended in new plant,
but for this purpose 75,000 shares were sold at 50s. nearly
two years ago, and shareholders are now asked to deter-
mine the issue of 50,000 shares still in reserve.
* * * *
Re the W.A. market: “ Business on ’change to-
day was very restricted in consequence of interruption of
the cable.” Reads as if the mines were at the other end
of the world; but that is the position always—nervous
until it is known what is doing in London, the place where
the money comes from. It is where the boom started,
and where the slump will come from, and when it comes,
stand from under if you can, and don’t squeak if you
can’t.

Net result of the great vice-regal trip round the
Murchison and Ooolgardie gold-fields : “His Ex. expressed
the opinion that in ten years W.A. would be one of the
largest gold-producing countries in (he world.” Rumored
that he is now going to write a book to electrify the world
and bring millions of Bull's surplus money to secure more
Lake Views, Great Boulders, &c.

They are agitating for cheaper railway freights
for Ooliie coal and Ooolgardie quartz over in W.A. H. M.
Deakin, who runs Collie coal, is reported to he making
heaps of money out of it already, and has at present a
virtual monopoly. His great idea is to knock out
castle coal, and to supply the big mines at Kalgoorlie
with the local article, as wood is getting dearer and
scarcer every dav. He wants the department to help him
by reducing rates. Vanzetti, who put up an 80-head bat-
tery at Northam two or three years ago (it has
remained idle nearly ever since, because there was no
stone available that would pay for treatment a couple of
hundred miles away), also wants the department to carry
ore at a nominal rate from mines to battery. “ Send up
coal to the fields, and then let. me have the empty trucks
to take quartz to my mill,” was Vanzetti's request, and at
a big deputation to John Forrest a strong effort was made
to get freights lowered accordingly. Dickie Speight was
trotted forth in support of the deputation’s views.

Whispered that a mysterious person is going
around certain camps buying up alluvial gold at better
prices than are obtainable from local storekeepers.
Any man is at liberty to do this—and do what he likes
with his own, even to using the gold to sweeten the clean-
up of a dredging scheme.

Croydon notes : May returns—quartz, 3009

Go., another Bull concern, but well managed, starting "
operations again in True Blue. Croydon Consols pro-
spects exceptionally jjood. No. 7 North Golden Gate
putting through big crushing for another div. result.
No. 1 North Golden Gate, after having been pig-rooted
for years, is now being worked experimentally by an Eng-
lish'syndicate with a view to ultimate purchase. Terms,
12 months trial, £lOOO down, balance of about, £10,090 to
come out of mine. Mountain Maid United, after being
practically abandoned by a co., has been taken up by two
practical miners, Young and Eccleston, who are now,
with battery and cyanide vats on the ground, clearing
something between £5OO and • 1000 per month. Other
good shows on Croydon only awaiting pluck and experi-
ence to come along and haul divs. out. Assistant Geolo-
gist Cameron endorsed Rands’ report re cutting-out of
Iguana reef in Ophir Block by a mass of intrusive granite,
so Govt, won’t grant subsidy for sinking deeper. Jim
Cashman and Fred Cuthbert, besides other well-known
Croydon “ stickers,” are rapidly accumulating fortunes
out of the south end of Golden Gate line. George Hours-

Chillagoes, 45s.—more than doubled in six
weeks No known development to warrant it. Recog-
nised that it will be two years before the railway is
running Same old reason : London has come into the
market. A good thing for the debenture underwriters,
who have already exercised one option to take shares at
much less than present market price, and can yet please
themselves about others. When all is over people will be
amazed at the total cost to the co. of the debenture-issue.

Burra mine (S.A.), which long rivalled Moonta
and Wallaroo, is a standing warning to the Minister
against accepting N.S.W. Chamber of Mines’ advice to do
away with labor conditions after a certain amount of
money has been spent on a lease. The Burra- eo. has no
labor'conditions to observe (it secured the freehold m the
early days), and so it has allowed its property to remain
idle' for 20 years. Two syndicates, and probably
more have made the co. offers to work the mine, but it
has refused them; and, though it paid huge divs., it
pleads that it has itself no money to spend in opening up
the property. And yet, two or three years ago, when
the metal was still very low in price, the S.A. Govt.
Geologist reported that the re-starting of the old mine
was quite warranted. What the co. is waiting for is a
mystery, but the fact remains thatthe mine still lies idle.
There is a steady English inquiry for man-
ganese-but there is little profit in prospect unless the
supply is handy to shipping. In the prospecting revival
in 8. A. the mineral has had some attention, and one ap-
parently promising: show has been developed on the West
Coast. Anyhow, it looks promising—the owners propose
to ship ore instead ot selling the claim.

Oapt. “ Bill ” Matthews, ex of Vic. goldfields,
Round Hill, (Barrier), and a show outside Bayley’s, has
been appointed S.A. inspector ot mines. Matthews and
Zeb. Lane were, in the old Barrier boom-days, fast pros-
pectus pals—they reported at one time or other on most
of the Barrier, and saw few blocks that didn’t offer some
encouragement. But the Round Hill, after one his-
toric flutter, duffered, while Zeli.’s mine—Block 14—
boomed. And the younger man’s luck stuck to him in
the West, while the other’s—well, he has taken a £4OO-a-
-year billet.
“Flyspeok” to Bulletin: Re Briseis.— ln
B. 27/5/’99 appear some very incorrect statements by
somone writing from Launceston. Firstly : “ Strange to
say no Govt, report has ever been made on the Briseis or
Derby tin fields.” Let me say that a Govt, plan and
report compiled by Mr. Thureau, when Tas. geologist,
may be got from the Mines Department for a small fee.
Govt, reports have since then been made, but whether
they have yet been published I can’t say. Secondly, the
writer says : “ The deposit certainly is enormous, so also
is the hole made in it.” Fact is deposit consists of 200 a.,
and the enormous hole made in it is less than half an acre
—in which no place is bottomed ! These are unassailable
facts. Last month’s clean-up was for 20 tons. The drifts
are exceedingly rich, and improving with depth, and next
month’s clean-up will exceed 30 tons ; as room is made
additional men will be employed. There is three or four
years’ sluicing now stripped. Re the silting-up of the
river: the co.’s have constructed a substantial wall that
confines the river to its course, which communicates with
the South Pacific, and so long as the ocean doesn’t siltup,
the river trouble is a myth.
The Tasmania’s latest crushing: From 1820
tons quartz, 2776 oz.—average of loz. Bdwt. 22gr. ; value,
£10,623. Total Tasmania figures to date : 455,0270 z.
lOdwt. I7gr. from 386,590 tons ; value, £1,655,092 ; divs.,
£691,071 15s. Bv the way, every Tas. newspaper unques-
tioninglv accepted the usual “ reporters’ niei.no.” supplied
by the office, and gravely printed the total divs. as
£71,071 15s. Only a trifling discrepancy of £620,000 !
From the latest crushing, a div. (the 167th) of Is. has
been paid. This sort of thing grows monotonous.
* * * *
The hands employed at the Mt. Lyell smelters
have not the healthiest of jobs. The sulphur fumes are
so overpowering as .to cause the utmost discomfort to
them ; men often bleed at the nose and sometimes at the
ears while at work. The fumes have killed all vegetation
around the smelters, and they even destroy the galvanised-
iron roofs of houses in the vicinity. But, despite all this,
the smelter is the least likely place on the Lyell works
to get a “ start” —presumably because the work is easy.
Bendigo mine-managers have from time imme-
morial been most considerate to newspaper reporters,
showing them round any day and any hour ; but when
lately one sauntered up and ordered the driver to lower
him away, they began to kick. Now there is a ukase that
the old privilege is to be restricted all. round. And still
the newspaper men there won’t have much cause to
growl. In Westralia tew mines admit reporters, except
in rare instances ; while at Broken Hill the most the
managers do is to admit them on regular visiting days,
and several mines don’t admit them at all.

Good mines have their bad times. Long Tunnel
(Vic ) shares have dropped from £'l2o to £74 in two

The South Tharsis Copper Co., Mt. Lyell,
have lately entered into a contract with the Austral Otis
Engineering Co., South Melbourne, to supply a complete
ciushing and concentrating plant for treatment of their
ores which are mostly low grade. The plant is to be a
very complete one and comprises compound steam-engine
and boiler of 100 horse-pmver, 3 rock-breakers, 2 sets Roger
rolls 8 4-compartment eccentric jiggs, 4 improved buddies
and Otis circular vanner, with the necessary trommels,
&c for sizing and classifying the ore. The plant
has’ a capacity of 100 tons per day, with provision
for 200 tons. The Otis Co. are also supplying a self-acting
tramway from the mine to the mill: also, a pumping plant
to supply the mill with water froin the dam. *
In Omeo (Vic.) distrct, £15,000 is being spent
on bringing in water for the electrical running of a
dredging-plant; in support of which it is stated that the
cost of fuel to work an ordinary dredge is from £7O to £BO
a week and some £4OOO a year will be saved by using
water as motive-power. The manager, R. R. Hedley,
ought to know what he is talking about, as the family,
father and sons, have been managers of the Yackandandah
for years. Dredge promoters, as a rule, don’t know what
they talk about. * m
Auckland : “ Tor past week, returns from 24
gold dredges in Otago district total 7700 z., an average of
slightly over 320 z. per dredge.” Why, if it were all profit
it wouldn’t pay a unique div., and it takes money to work
that number ‘of machines. The public will wait long
before seeing this extract published in any N.S.W. dredge

If Marconi’s wireless telegraphy can advance to
the business stage it will be another cloudlet on the
copper sky. At present Marconi’s system, being unable
to provide secrecy, is useless for commercial or private
purposes, but once that gulf is bridged Ruin is the word
for hundreds of manufactories and scores of thousands of
employes. Electricians the world over now concede the
palm to copper wire as a current-carrier; compared with
iron wire, the net results are copper 91, iron 65 per cent,
and copper “ lives ” nearly twice as long as iron. In Q.
alone this year some £25,000 worth of copper wire is to be
erected so consider the total consumption! This air
idea was mooted by Prof. Oliver Lodge years back, and in

To compete with the yellow tin-producing boss
of the'.Straits is a tough contract. First, there is the low

seemed inevitable. Madden and the scribes, how
ever, were the only people ready. The former
came on to the bench with a more than usually
profound bow and the appearance of a man who
ad s P ent hal f the night making fine phrases.
MMr. Slattery: "As the whole prorince was to be treated as one electorate (so far as the Senate
is concerned) the effecl might be that they might have the most able and brilliant man in the
province rejected simply because his fame did not extend over the province."
In which cast it is bound to be composed somewhat as below-provided, of course, that all gocs
well in the test-matches-with Bill Martin, Joe Meuson, Bob Walne, Larry Foley, and other
representative and well-known men well up on the poll.
He attitudinised worse than Wilson Barrett, and
his tongue itched ; but the Bar was oblivious of
the fact that they stood before a man whose pomp
had got another puff since the Court rose on the
previous afternoon. As the lawyers settled down
to the business of the Court, “ a cloud came o’er
his brow. I hank fully the scribes gathered up
their pencils and left. One junior alone stayed
behind, and rushing over to one of the banisters,
whispered. What about your congratulations ? ”
A look of horrified astonishment veiled the
lawyer s face as he communicated the fact of the
omission to the other barristers. In a few minutes
a phone message was flying to the various news-
paper offices : ‘ The Bar will congratulate the
.Lieut.-(.tov. immediately after luncheon adjourn-
ment. Blease send a reporter.”

“ Rottnest ” : Gov. Beauchamp put his
foot in it about that Birthstain while in W. A. so
local (W.A.) papers heard nothing of it. Bulle-
tin brought the first news of it here. One
chappie, who regards reading the B. as wild dissi-
pation, asked me if I had read the Bulletin’s
latest—“ Frightful skit on Lord Beauchamp, don’t
you know ” Said it was “ awfully funny, but too
rough on a fellah ; men out heah could see the
joke, but they might think it true at Home, don-
cherknow.” Same individual refuses to believe
that the extracts from Sydney Telegraph’s anti*
b ederation articles are not the wild humor of
some malevolent Bulletin man.

Printed that Cardinal Moran has already
tipped Beauchamp as Australia’s first Governor-
General. Let’s see. The Cardinal tipped Car-
mgton when Governor, Jersey when Governor,
and on a visit to Melbourne he tipped Hopetoun
when Governor there, for this same billet. Blar-
ney, when artistically used, is a soothing emol-
lient. But it has been remarked that his
Eminence never tipped the straight-faced Hamp-
den for the job.

And now if the S.A. press would mention the
color of the cat that the dog which lives in the

cess the dog in the white dog-kennel usually has in
overtaking the cat, provided the cat hasn’t too
long a start, the public demand for information
about Gov. Tennyson should be about satisfied.

That casual kind of husband who grows in
Australia turned up again—or, rather, he didn’t
turn up—in Sydney Divorce Court. It was the
old, old story of how love’s bright young dream
was wrecked for want of a little furniture. They
had loved each other for four years, but he never
saved up enough money to buy furniture; so,
when they were married, he took
her to his mother’s house. His
mother refused to have her in
the house, and, in the absence
of any furniture of their
own, she went back to stay
with her own parents. He
called to see her twice,
and then, not seeing his
way to get the furni-
ture, he never came
any more. She spent
another three years
qualifying for divorce
on the ground of de-
sertion, so her love-
tale consisted of six
years’ suspense with
an oasis of two days’
precarious matrimony
in the centre of it.
The want of furniture
has a lot to answer
for. Evon the tender-
est variety of affec-
tion has been fur-
nished by Providence
with something of its
own to sit upon, and
can be blighted by the
want of a place to de-
posit it on. The other
things thatgoto wrecl"
a happy married life
all put together
drink, gambling,
mother-in-law, am-
bition, fickleness,
immorality, coldness
of disposition, cruelty, incompatibil-
ity of temper, the other girl, the
lodger, religious mania, and all the rest
are not a patch on the blighting,
sordid influence of the want of a three-
and-sixpenny chair for the grl to sit upon.
The worst of. the other evils seldom wrecks
anybody’s bright dream inside less than a
month ; the harrowing absence of furniture can
do it almost to a dead certainty in a night. And
the law hasn’t sense enough to see it. It insists
that the parties shall be of age, or have the con-
sent of their guardians if they are under age ; and
that they shall have no other wife or husband
living ; but it never thinks of inquiring if they
have three chairs and a table and an iron bedstead.

When Judge Stephen recently remarked,
in Sydney Divorce Court, that “half the divorce-
cases were due to the marriage of people who
knew very little of each other,” he might have
gone further and said that the other half of the
cases were due to the marriage of people who
knew too much of each other.

A proposal for introducing the ’rickshaw
as a means of conveyance is heard of in Adelaide.
Ihe rickshaw is a somewhat different cab with a
ni^&er instead of a horse, and in India and Ceylon
it swarms like the locust.' The limp Anglo-
Indian, when he comes out of his house
or his club, simply leans up against the
door-post, and says, in a faint voice, “ ’rick-
shaw.” No matter how late or how lonely
it is there is always a response ; the earth
opens and erupts the nigger and his vehicle
on the instant. In all southern and eastern
Asia it is hardly possible to say “’rick-
shaw’’twice before the somewhat different
cab and the man-horse are forthcoming.
Then the limp white man crawls in, and the
rugger runs like Hades (gradual Indian
Hades, that is) for five miles or so, for
twopence. The true Anglo-Indian never
hands him the money. He gets out at his
destination, and fishes out the coin with a
limp, brown hand, and drops it on the
ground without looking at it, and the man-
horse gathers it out of the dust and puts it
in his loin-rag. No genuine Anglo-Indian
flogs the rickshaw-man with his umbrella to
make him go faster, for the genuine Anglo-
Indian is tired and boneless, and takes
things lying down; and, besides, time stands
still in steamy Hindostan, and no one cares
much whether he arrives yesterday or next
week. But the stranger generally pounds on
the back of the respectable colored house-

Sensation has been caused in Maoriland
by the suspension of lawyer Jellieoe, of Welling-
ton, for three months. Jellieoe was imported from
England years ago to prosecute the once-famous
Waring Taylor. Finding Wellington a good field
he stayed on, and soon proved himself the boss

ever, he could not get rid of his Old Bailey ways,
and soon became an object of terror and hatred to
bar, bench and witnesses alike. The late Judge
Richmond, mildest and most impartial of men,
had frequent stormy scenes with him, while he
was soon not on speaking terms with a good
number of the lawyers. At last he gave an open-
ing. Edwards, the lately-appointed Judge, is on
bad terms with Jellicoe. The latter was lately to
appear before him for a servant-girl in a Case of
wrongful dismissal. Jellicoe filed an affidavit
stating that Edwards’s wife had recently been
EXPERIENCED IN THE HUSBAND
BUSINESS.
HE : “I am nearly twice your age. I have buried
one wife, been sued twice for divorce, and once
for breach-of-promise.”
SHE: “ But are these reasons why I should marry
you?”
HE : "Rather; there’s nothing I don’t know!”

case mighty be heard before some other Judge.
Ihe Law Society seized its chance; the Court
of Appeal ordered the affidavit to be withdrawn
from the file, and suspended Jellicoe for three
months. Like most little men, Jellicoe is full of
hght, and has given notice of appeal to the Privy
Council. Meanwhile, the hopes of his legal

confreres that at last they were going to have a
cut-in at the criminal business of Wellington,
have been damped by an advt. that Jellicoe, dur-
ing his suspension, will give legal advice free. _ As
his managing clerk is a qualified barrister, it is
plain that the criminal classes, after all, will not
be absolutely in need of the other lawyers.
Some of the developments in the Edwards-
Jellicoe imbroglio have been sensational. The
Guardian, a local paper, espoused Jellicoe’s cause
and announced that its next issue would contain a
full exposure of Mrs. (Judge) Edwards’ treatment
of her servant girls, the point on which the whole
incident has turned. George Hutcheson, of “Bun
Tuck ” celebrity, replied with a masterstroke.
He had a bill of sale over the Guardian’s plant
and of this but a few pounds remained unpaid,
but he took the whole into execution. He even
proposed to use the plant to expedite the issue of
the proposed opposition paper, the Critic.
Jellicoe came to the rescue of his ally, and inter-
viewed Hutcheson, who as the result took the
amount outstanding, and the Guardian was able,
a little late in the day, to mount guard once more.

Two well-known Melb. doctors who came
over to Sydney, the other day, in the interests of
Federation, had each a single nip of whisky at a
Miller’s Point pub. with the result that both spent
the whole night sleepless and vomiting and had to
seek medical assistance. The two morals whereof
are that Miller’s Point Whisky is a splendid thing
to run away from, and that beastly foreigners had
best beware how they invade Geebungopolis to
tamper with the sacred cause of Cabbage-tree
Parochialism.

The Dawn of Heavenly Light : In S.A., a
few weeks ago, a teacher who had been falsely
charged with the usual offence by the usual
prurient young woman, sued the dirty little
female for’libel damages, and actually got a ver-
dict for £5O and costs. The law flatly refuses to
prosecute the girl perjurer, who is absolutely free
from all criminal risks, but it seems that she can
be sometimes got at civilly.

A lady recently wailed loudly in Welling-
ton (M.L.) Press that the “ ladies’ room ” at the
local public library was a wilderness of bare
tables, where not a fragment of printed
matter was to be seen. Also (sob) the lava-
tory was in a most neglected condition.
And, later on, librarian Rowe, usually a
very inoffensive little man, reared up in
print and said that everything that was
left in or about the “ladies’ room”
was promptly stolen, even to the
lavatory-towels and the files that held
the papers. Women had been caught,
he said, with magazines pinned to
their petticoats, and books tied round
their legs, and—just here the pub-
lic blushed, wondered who had con-
ducted the investigations, and
rushed off to ask its own wife if she
had been to the public library lately.

Mildura, the Vic. irrigation
settlement on the Murray, has just
completed its 11th year. The settlers
have had a hard battle, and are battling
still; but they are putting a lot of brains into
their work. Their “winter-evening discus-
sions ” are a sample of the local spirit: instead
of the ordinary country “dawnce,” they
meet at convenient premises, and mix papers
on apricot-packing with songs, and discus-
sions on raisin-growing with the universal
“instrumental duet.” At latest, there were
7750 acres of irrigated land under cultivation
for fruit, and 942 acres for other purposes.
The Dora Bromley and Dungey case could,
a Sydney lawyer asserts, have been settled in one
act in the way Vic. Govt, desired had it been
allowed to go into Court in the ordinary way and
then been met by a plea of Crown pardon. The
Crown should not, it is held, intervene in the pro-
cedure leading up to trial, but when the time of
trial comes may offer the plea of pardon, which
bars all future actions.

The last resource of the alien-coddlers.
Certain Govt, barraokers, staggered at the recent
additions to the leper-list in Bananaland, are ask-
ing plaintively, “Is it not possible that leprosy is
indigenous to Queensland ? If some casual
Hindoo introduces the bubonic P next week,
some wretched sycophantic apologs , fc
his bind-legs and ask, meekly,

According to the official report for ’9B, the

None of the numerous newspaper quota-
tions from Younghusband’s up-to-date book,
“ The Philippines and Round About, include the
most important passage in the volume. Touching
the local Spanish priest, Younghusband says :
It would be impossible to speak with too great severity
of the disrepute into which the action of fche ? e .^*® I s °
men has brought the R.C. religion in these islands. A
man of God on whom rest the most solemn vows of holi
ness, chastity, and poverty, living amongst a simple and
impressionable race, a monster of iniquity, an extensive
landowner, nursing his ill-gotten wealth, a monument o
lechery and debauch. Let us hasten to add that the
Filipino himself is far from being morally immaculate.
The priest mav take his daughter or his sister and wel-
come! for the offspring will be a person ofpadded
importance as European blood never fails to
Eastern countries. But the islander draws a line firmly
at his wife, and equally firmly at his intended bride ; and
it is from wanton straying into these forbidden pastures
that the good shepherd has been mainly instrumental in
bringing his country into trouble.

Rakaia (M.L.) railway-smash didn’t pan
out in aid of the great Cold Tea cause. On the
contrary, the accursed derrmk was the direct means
of saving the lives of about 60 excursionists who,
as the night was cold and wet and the train was
waiting, left the rear carriages and trooped into
the Railway Hotel a few yards off. While they
were drinking the smash took place,
who keep count of the lives sacrificed to alcohol
should place these 60 to the credit side of the

A DARK MYSTERY.
BOY : “ What's that? ”
MOTHER: “A type-writer, dear.”

BOY: “ Then, what did father mean when he told
Mr. Reynolds that he'd just poured a pint of
champagne down his type-writer?"
Dear Bul-
letin.—l have
this from a man
who saw it.
Very few saw
it; and they
were influenced
to hush it up :
It was on board
an ocean - liner,
England - bound
from Sydney,
nearing Ply-
mouth. We were
at dinner. The
Man was seated
next to me, facing
the Woman, who
was flirting openly
and defiantly (as
during most of the
voyage) with the
ship’s doctor, a
young-old r o u 6
with a pleasing
exterior and a
sympathetic
voice. I had ob-
served the Man
and the Woman
closely, and had
come to the con-
clusion that they
were newly-mar-
ried. He looked
like an American,
was cult u re d,
proud, highly-
sensitive, and
jealous. She
claimed to be Aus-
tralian, and had
the form of a
Venus, the face of
a Bacchante.
There came a lull
in the conversa-
tion. The Man
turned from me
and looked at his
wife. She and
the doctor had
their glasses
raisedto drink to
each other. As
they clicked them
together, the Man
rose and in a quiet
voice forbade her
to drink. “You
forbid me ? Then
you shall have it
yourself ! an d
with a ringing
laugh she flung
the contents of
her glass in his
face. The Ma n

the red wine from

Melbourne’s legal world has been consider-
ably disturbed of late by the matter of ap acting
County Court judgeship. ihe vacancy
through the departure of Judge Casey to Europe or
somewhere, on “ leave,’ and, inasmuch as said
Casey is somewhat old and altogether nnsuitabie
,it seems probable that the "was the firs!
foecotiAe a permanency. Walsh, Q. k vv n i s h
man appointed to fill Caseys shoes, but Walsh,
who is about half-way on the road between 7Q and
80, was knocked out m a week pr two, and thre
up the sponge. Then there was som talk of
,O’Hara Wood fpr the position, on the strength o
his having prpved a first-oiass secretary to the
Law Instftute. The Crown might have taken
kindly to young man Wood but for hw w- „
routing of the police in the Mansfield , ln |'rder
.case, where he held the brief for Anastasia Butler,
and persuaded the coroner’s jury to find an open
verdict. Finally, barrister VV. E. Johnston go

It is hard to say whether N.S.W. country
press or country borough councils are the more
financially reckless. Cootamundra borough conn-
oil invited tenders lately for advertising council
business and the three local papers entered
the breach—think of it; three papers in such a
place! Two cut the sums asked as low as pos-
sible, they allege, but the third offered to do the
work for nothing, and the council accepted that
offer, “The Press, gentlemen, the Archimedean
lever.” _ ,

At Marble Bar, W. A., there was a sliivoo
on Queen’s-birthnight. AH the local elite, in-

wasn’t there, and missed hearing some unkind re-
marks made about him by Brockman, J.l. rLo\y-
ever, next day Ostlund sent for Brcckinan and
promptly “ stoushed him in the eye,” following up
by slamming the door in his face. Brockman tried
to get at his assailant, but the warden, a big
Dane, wasn’t looking for any. Brockman in-
tended going for the warden in the local Oourt,
but who was to adjudicate was an open question.

Greraldton (N.Q.) folks recently had a

face and body. Old story—Leprosy. John was
very polite; invited the constable — Yon like
’em olangee ; take ’em plenty!” Said, further,
he must have contracted the trouble from certain
gay Japanese ladies, but the recently-formulated
“ indigenous leprosy ” theory would, of course,
upset that little romance.

Judge Gaunt, of Vic., still continues his
lunatic-producing course of inflicting huge doses
of solitary confinement. At the just-closed Melb.
sessions, his Honor distributed among five unfor-
tunates no less than 18 weeks of this awful seclu-
sion—a week at a time. One wretch, already con-
demned to five years, with a liberal allowance of
solitary, was ordered a further couple of years,
with six weeks of the silent-cell horror. No
wonder insanity is increasing in Victoria. Judge
Gaunt alone would account for as many lunatics
as six distilleries, with a brewery thrown in.

The most illuminating frock in the play falls to
Miss Viola Gillette, a tall, auburn-haired girl with
a sulky side-face and splendid figure. A black
jetted net over white silk forms the frock proper.
Over this again is a brilliant scarlet velvet polon-
naise that starts from the yoke and runs in a
point to the front edge of the skirt and slits open
up the back over a flow of jetted net. With this
is worn a cream straw-hat with tall yellow roses
and red swathed ribbon. Miss Gillette lets a
prettymezzo voice roam effectively round “Because

Friedenthal’s matinees drew crowds of school-
girls to the Town Hall, and they listened in wonder
te the Harmonious Blacksmith and Invitation to
the Waltz. Very good programmes were pre-
sented at these matinees, with just the pieces
every schoolgirl murders. If Friedenthal can
save a little music from this slaughter by his
intelligent expositions he will have done a good
deed. All the little innocent classics transported
themselves on his great Bechstein, from the
bp ring-song to the Path etique which we alwavs
have with us, though why we always have it with
us is a wonder and a mystery.
There was a child—perhaps more than one—who
very early heard of the Sonata Pathetique. They
always p ay it m books, you know, and she was
continually reading how Lois poured her soul out
on the passionate sonata, how Edward put the
sorrow of a lifetime into its exquisite melancholy.
As soon as Czerny was left behind, the child asked
for Ihe Sonata Pathetique.” Now was she
going to play the loveliest, most divinely sad
music in the worid. She expected that the first
bars would thrill her little head with exquisite
sorrow. But it was all a disappointment. Never
never did she come to the Pathetique. “When
A° e J 111 t° sad ? ” she asked continually.
And the teacher would shrug his shoulders and
play out a little passage. “ There’s the pathos ”
he would say (only he called it pyethos, it
sounded like pie-crust.) He hammered the bars
out again and again. “Listen—sad! that’s it”
But it was never Pathetique to her—never, never.
Not even when great masters interpreted it, for,
between ourselves, the pathos is all shoddy, as the
popularity of the sonata indicates.
Apropos of pathetics, a rather new singing bird is
telling people, “My friends tell me I have a
pathetic soprano. ” Whereas her friends say they
said something different from that —to her.
Next, please! The footballers called on the

Man s vanity again ! A Sydney lieutenant and
gentleman lias just been sued by his tailor over a
scarlet tunic trimmed with silver lace and tracing,
lhe case divulged a secret, incidentally. That
that scarlet and silver was to outshine the frocking
of another man —who happened, by the way, to be
Colonel Neild. Just think of the glory and glitter
of the human being who could excel Mr. Neild
at a ball, or anywhere else ! And just think—all
women who are called vain because you want to
dress ahead of your dearest enemy—of the example
set you by the superior animal. Another sign
that men sometimes think of their looks. Since
the clean-shaven Beauchamp came, every second
man looks like the undiscovered quantity between
a meat-axe and a hungry sheep. Lip garniture is
deadly old-fashioned already, and men are uncon-
sciously giving the cut direct to their creditors in
consequence. One well-known man about town
has just emerged from the beard of years. He
states seriously that he has noticed a change in all
the women that know him. They are so much
more friendly and seem to have suddenly acquired
a new interest in him.
There are two warlike heroes in Sydney at

The new P. and O. regulations seem to satisfy
neither passengers nor officers. I hear in a private
letter that in Bngland fifty officers have resigned
m a body, and it is believed that that is only the
beginning of an emphatic protest about to be
made. Ihe company will probably have to strike
some golden mean, as is done on other lines of
mail-steamers. In the other companies the officers

freedom as took place between officers and passen-
gers on board the China, and which, it would
appear, was the cause of its stranding.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
Chief Justice Miadden has been giving his
hunting experiences in a press article; but why
not throw his judicial glamour on a chapter about
his old boxing bouts ? They won him more distinc-
tion, it is said. By the way, the perpendicular
centre-crease that always distinguishes the Chief
Justice’s—er—trousers inspired a conundrum
lately put by a Melb. girl to a group of friends in
Colhns-street. ‘When is the Acting-Governor
like a journalist? Give it up? When he sends
his “articles ”to press.’ Next, please.
Cecil Ward, as the King’s Musketeer, looks
a very distant relation of the 1 lean, brown swords-
man from Gascony,’ recently hankered after in
these columns. The local version of Dumas’ dare-
devil serves up a sturdy lump of a chubby-cheeked
swashbuckler, with rather a Handy-Andyish, not
to say Simple-Simonlike air. In Muskeeter uni-
form of ruby velvet, pale-blue silk, white slash-
ings and fierce boots, the smartened-up Gascon is
still too cherubic for a professional fire-eater.
Even after the whirling perils of his desperate
quest, there’s scare a ha’porth of pathetic, haggard
tenseness on show. Certainly the poor knight-
errant looks flushed, flustered and untidy, and as
he rests his dizzy head on his lady-love’s knee
fond mothers in the audience pitifully recall the
time when greedy-boy called mamma up at mid-
night to confess he did eat those missing apples
and now feels so ill.
“Miladi Henrietta Watson throughout affects
waist-tabbed bodices, deep lace collars turned
back from the shoulders, raven side-curls and the
rest of her hair tucked under her hat, leaving a
neat neck-nape on view. With a bluey-green
brocade, touched with pink beb<s velvet, goes a
delightful black-velvet hat piled with white
plumes. Then there’s a black velvet suit, slashed
with white, and a white satin ball-gown sprinkled
with black moons. Those bold, bad midnight
goings-on are seen through in a white chiffon neg-
ligee, over which, when surprised by Richelieu
(Hawtrey), the resourceful wearer slips a filmy
green redmgote, succeeded by a grey cloak for the
wheedling of her Puritan dupe (D. Glassford).
“He Miladi’s death-agony: it’s sickening to see
four alleged heroes stand callously round, while a
tortured she-devil makes faces, curls-up and dies.

her raven locks on top and scintillates in a

“News was lately received from England of the

GOOD HEALTH WITHOUT DRUGS.

Mothers who would keep their children in good
health should give them, morning and evening,
Dr. Tibbies’ Vi-Cocoa made with hot milk. Deli-
cate men and women who have weak lungs, to be
hale, robust, and healthy should use Dr. Tibbies
Vi-Cocoa morning and evening, and all men who
have to be exposed to the bleak uncertainty of our
trying climate should fortify themselves before
they face their daily toil with Dr. Tibbies Vi-
Cocoa, and they can then brave the fury of the
elements with equanimity. The writer speaks
from personal experience and from observation of
beneficial effects on others. Tea opens the pores
and temporarily excites, coffee stimulates the
action of the heart, whilst Dr. Tibbies Vi-Cocoa
gives strength, stamina, and builds _up And
strengthens the lung tissues. It is indeed a
wonderful food beverage. Nothing has ever been
discovered that can approach it in giving lightness
of heart, joy of life, fleetness of foot, and that
general feeling of comfort which only comes from
a full capacity to enjoy every pleasure, moral,
intellectual, and physical. , t . , , ..
Dr. Tibbies’ Vi-Cocoa can be obtained from all
chemists, grocers and stores, or from Dr. Tibbies
Vi-Cocoa, Limited, 269 George-street, Sydney.

The sixth anniversary of Premier King-

tended, and stuck to him despite the refusal of

Justice A’Beckebt (Vic.) is very absent-
minded. The yarn goes that he one morning went
into brother-Justice Holroyd’s chambers with—
“ I’ve just heard a real good story in the train.”
Then, seeing “Irving’s Digest” on the table, lie
remarked, “That’s a first-rate work, Holroyd.”
“Yes,” replied the other. For a few minutes
A’Beckett idly turned over the pages, and then,
having forgotten the story he came to tell, said,
“ Well, bye-bye,” and walked out.
A link with the past has just gone over at
Nowra. James Thompson was a Tas. native,
born 75 years ago, in Gov. Arthur’s time. For 52
years he resided in the Shoalhaven district, and

He was a member of the first N.S.W. Parliament
under Responsible Government. His father was
an officer of marines, and his mother a daughter
of the historic Mrs. Reibey, whose other daughter
married Capt. “ Peg-leg ” Innes, father of the
late Judge Innes.
An irreverent ’Groper writes from Gerald-
ton (W.A.) about Premier Forrest’s pants :
Yesterday (14th inst.) our military band was playing on
the local hospital grounds, in honor of the visit of our
Premier, John Forrest. Said gentleman was present in a
Beaufort coat, the tails of which flourished more or less
in the wind. During Bigjohn’s parade round the ground
amusement was great amongst the crowd present, for, at
every snort of the wind, the said coat tails flew out,
revealing about 3in. of white shirt sticking out of copious
hole in pants.
One of the funniest incidents of N.S.W.

slip at a public meeting. “ Those who were
opposing the Bill,” he said, “ would find them-
selves no more able to keep back Federation than
to keep back the Atlantic at South Head. (A
voice : ‘ It’s the Pacific.’) Mr. Smith wished that
small-minded people like the interjector, who
liked to hear themselves talk, would hire a hall on
their own account instead of attending to disturb
thoughtful people.”

Melb. demise : Dr. Barker, brother of that
rather famous surgeon who was so rough and
gruff, but, like a orab-apple, sweet within if cor-

hard to understand how he had been such an
excellent bushman in the early goldfields days.

W. E. Johnston, M.A., LL.B., just
appointed an acting judge of Vie. County Court,
is a member of the Argus advisory board. He
did a brilliant University course at Melbourne,
and ought to have taken to engineering, as his
brain is too lazy for law. His father, J. S.
Johnston, was at one time general manager of the
Argus, and his appointment is no doubt due to
his connection with that paper. The appointment
will probably become permanent, as Judge Casey
is quite unlikely to return to the bench. Johnston
sen. was one of the founders of St. Kilda. In
1848 he (J.S.J.) kept an hotel in William-street,
where Bishop Perry stayed when he arrived.
Brunton Stephens’ “ Lost Chance ’’ is said
to have been founded on an incident which
happened in the homestead of Dr. Barker, the
recently - deceased Melb. medico. Prior to the
discovery of gold, the whole of Castlemaine field
was Barker’s station, and it passed out of his
hands without the subterranean wealth ever
becoming known. One day, prior to the gold-
times, a shepherd found a big nugget, and, elated
at the thought of having made a pile, he proudly
exhibited it to his companions. One and all
scoffed at him for his credulity,. and, bluffed out
of a fortune, he flung the slug into a gully, and
returned to his sheep.
Died recently, at Castlemaine (Vic.),
Councillor A. C. Yandell, a sturdy old Devonian,

prop. Asked by a local magnate what he thought
of the acoustics of a new town hall. , “ Mr.
Mayer,” he replied emphatically, “ I can’t smell
nothing ! ” He was the dear old boy who said in
Council, in connection with a short-lived contract
for electrio-light in the town (mentioned, by the
way, by Mark Twain in “ More Tramps Abroad
as a proof of Australian progress) that the con-
tractor “ had everything ready except a certain
substance called dinnamo, which I believe is now
upon the ’igh seas.” Also, he triumphantly re-
ported a successful deputation as “a splendid
fiasco,” and recommended the planning of a street
“ similar to the St. Kilda Asplenade.”
“ Blister For long years the Melb. and
Sydney press has persistently ridiculed old
Metrop. Board Fitzgibbon, until the multitude
have come to regard him as part imbecile, part
mountebank. Yet the fact remains that Fitz and
Fitz alone has bossed the city of Melb. for 20
years, and nothing and no one has ever been able
to shift him from any position he wanted to hold
on to. First, as town clerk, without any proper
authority, he was actual boss-cocky of the City
Council, running the mayors and other sapheads
just as he liked. And, later, as the autocrat of
the Smells Board nobody dared dispute his fiat,
and there he is fixed immovable for as long as he
cares to remain. And this in spite of his having
proved himself one of the worst financiers and the
very worst “pote ” ever known.
Melb. Argus and Age carry their rivalry
to fearful and wonderful lengths. While the Age
terms all medical men “Dr.,” in accordance with
popular practice its opp<?nent carefully labels
them with their exact qualifications, some of the
best-known men in Melb. thus appearing as “ Mr.
Blank, L.R.C.P., L.R.C.S.” But the animosity
doesn’t stop there, for poor innocent words which
have got in the way in the fight have suffered,
too. “ Lillydale,” as the Age terms it, is “ Lily-
dale ” in the Argus; it is Manila or Manilla,
according to how far up Collins-street a scribe is
when he is writing it; and even the private, name
of boss detective McManamny (Age version) is
termed “ Macmanamny ” in the Freetrade jour-
nal. The wonder of it is that when the Argus
publishes cat c-a-t, David Syme doesn’t issue an
instruction to spell it w-a-k.
George Gordon must have been the abso-
lutely most modest-mannered painter in the
theatrical world. He would yarn with a press-
man acquaintance about anything and everything
connected with the profession—except his own
beautiful work. He never seemed to want to talk
“ scenery ” if one met him in the front of the
house, and he had a live horror of seeming at all
theatrical in his dress or style. The writer re-
calls to mind a case in point, when young Gordoti,
standing beside his father, told him that he hadn t
fixed his hat on straight. Whereupon the per-
turbed George removed the venerable soft felt,
and gave it a reproving glance, and put it carefully
back upon his head,' remarking that he didn’t
want to be taken for an artist. It needed a good
deal of whisky to make George Gordon assert his
position, and then he had one particularly humor-
ous way of showing his dignity. On rare oc-
casions he might be seen sitting, pensive and
alone, in the manager’s box at Meib. Princess’s, a
Eretty sure indication that the artist had found
is way thither under the influeuce of divine
afflatus from a bottle. And now, alas ! G.G., in
the private box, is one of the good old jokes that
have passed away.

“ An Ex-elect ” to The Bulletin
The comparison of the “ Cardinal’s elect ” with the Irish
soggarths, at St. Mary’s, a few Sundays back, was unfair.
The latter were men in the prime of life ; 75 per cent, of
the former vyere under 21. Students, as a rule, presume
not to boast of rosy complexions these will come later,
with the contented lives priests lead. I question, too,
if those rosy, thick-necked, big-bodied soggarths could
hold their own in the practical work of Australian
parishes with the somewhat smaller, but hardier, Aus-
tralian. Put a few of each on horseback or cycles, and
compare them. The writer knows that many of “the
elect” have served their time in the rough-and-tumble of
bush life, and that’s what makes men. As to t heir being
“ depressed-looking,” let the writer have a look in at them
some day when they are playing football.
The whirligig of time ! Here is Frank
Madden (old Judge Moles worth always called him
“ Mr. Francis Madden ”) calling David Syme to
account about that land at Macedon which David
took up under the 42nd clause in ’69. Well, D.S.
wasn’t then the millionaire he is now, nnd the
Age wasn’t the property it now is. And one of
the Age’s best friends in those remote days was
James Goodall Francis, member for Richmond,
who became Frank Madden’s father-in-law. And,
here now, is Mr. Francis Madden knocking D.
Syme on the head with a parliamentary jemmy,
and doing deeds that are enough to make poor old
J.G.F. turn in his grave. In all likelihood,
Madden's father-in-law helped to get Syme the
land by the Mount —and maybe that’s how Francis
11. knows so much about the business.
“ Scotsman ” to The Bulletin :
You have printed one obituary of Dr. Robert Wallace,
M.P. ; let me give you another, in a different key. Dr.
Wallace, who, it is cabled, was seized with apoplexy in the
House of Commons while denouncing British brutality
—administrative and political—in the Soudan, was
one of the most remarkable men in the Imperial Parlia-
ment. When young, he attracted immense audiences as
a preacher, and rose to the Moderatorship of the General
Assembly of Scotland. He then passed into the pro-
fessional chair of Theology at Edinburgh University,
which he relinquished for the editorship of the Scotsman
—the leading daily paper in the Land o’ Cakes. An un-
fortunate incident in the Commons’ press-gallery led to
Wallace’s enforced resignation, after a stormy scene
between the editor and the proprietor. For some years
Wallace was lost in London, where he kept his identity
secret, and read for the Bar. Read for the Bar ! A man
who had risen by sheer ability and erudition to the mast-
head of success in three different capacities—as Theo-
logical scholar, preacher and pressman—coolly slung to
the winds his past achievements and reputation,
and started life afresh among strange associates
and surroundings, and in the most distressing
penury. But he did not allow himself to rust
m London. There came a time when the man could
no longer hold himself back. His native town was
being stormed by Liberal renegades—who had ratted on
Gladstone-and his old paper, the Scotsman, was fighting
like an inspired fiend against its former god. Chancellor-
of-Exchequer Goschen had captured an Edinburgh seat,
and was standing for re-election, when Wallace took the
mail for the Scotch capital and plunged into one of the
most bitter and brilliant election-fights on record. Both
candidates were giants, and both stirred by the fierce fires
of conviction and very intense temperaments. Goschen,
rasping and acrimonious, and brutal in his denunciation
of Home Rule and Irish politicians, was backed by the
great daily paper and all the money influence of the
town ; Wallace, massive, eloquent, and the darling of the
people, was supported by his old friends, his picturesque
personality, and his magnificent intellectual gifts. When
the figures went up the town was in flames—Cabinet-
Minister Goschen was beaten by oyer 2000 votes, an im-
portant seat was recaptured for Liberalism, and Parlia-
ment secured a recruit who had no peer within its walls.
And, like the grand man he was, he dies alongside John
Morley, with a vehement protest on his lips against op-
pression and legal butchery. If that man had only mas-
tered his one defect!

Dear Bulletin.—Anybody ever comment
on difference of status between “ inside ” and
out-back policemen. Inside, commoners; out-
back, toffs—who mix only with squatters and
such, and in “doing their duty ” always take care
to keep on good terms with that class, for the
station is bobby’s lodging-house when doing his
rounds, and if he is not a friend of the squatter he
gets very uncomfortable quarters. One great
reason for the one-sidedness of law in far-out

Mutton-birding is a very uncertain game.
To get at them one has to shove his hand into
their nests (always in a hole in the ground) and
pull them out. Occasionally one catches hold of
a snake, with which the Straits Islands absolutely
swarm, but mutton-birders think little of this—
they say snakes are always asleep when in their
holes and that it takes them over a minute to
wake. Mutton - birds (about
the size of a magpie and of a
sooty-black color) are, after
being caught, killed; the oil
is then squeezed out of them ;
they are plucked and salted
down. They are not at all bad
eating, though rather oily, and
are often recommended to consumptives as a
special diet.

An Assyrian hawker who travels N.S.W.

on the subject by a Murrumbidgee squatter who
offered to tether a turkey at 30yds. and, if the
brown man hit the bird in six shots, let him have
it for supper. The mark was fixed and the boss
handed the shooter his breechloader and half-a-
dozen blank cartridges. But the hawker happened
to have in his pocket a loaded cartridge which he
rang-in at the third shot and blew the gobbler’s

Dear Bulletin.— Another imported curse
which is increasing with startling rapidity is the
English rook. In Yass (N.S.W.) district they
settle down in a cloud on newly-soWn fields,
scratching it over like a flock of fowls. Whether
the crows have learnt the habit from them writer
can t say, but certain it is that they have also
taken to raking seed out of the ground, and doing
pretty well as much damage in the standing corn
as a flock of cockatoos. Can Bulletin readers
say if the newly-acquired habit is confined to Yass
district? W. [The rook in Britain doesn’t
scratch the earth—he uses his bill; and that only
after worms, etc. The seed-grain he incidentally
eats is of trifling quantity.]

“ Beloh ” asks a question :
Dear Bulletin.— Am curious to learn if the Q. or S.A.
aborigines have any records of what took place 4 or 5
generations back. The W. A. natives have carvings in
wood that have been handed down from generation to
generation, and are preserved by a coating of grease and
powdered charcoal. Some of them are as much as 9 feet

long and beautifully carved. Before the advent of the
white man these “ Enmahs ” must have taken months to
make with the primitive native tools.
On above subject writes H. Stockdale
There is in parts of N.W. Australia a remarkable cere-
monial implement—board-like in appearance, from 8 to
10ft. long by 12 or 15in. wide, and marked, in the only
two specimens I have seen, as shown in illustration ; but
as the natives were then wild, and didn’t understand
white fellow, I was unable to get much information about
them. I have since, however, learnt that they were
“ rain-makers,” and held very sacred, as with all their
Churinga (sacred stones, bull-roarers, &c.) handed down
from generation to generation with the traditions and
rules for the mysterious rites therewith connected. The
two “rain-boards” mentioned were hidden in a rocky
crevice, and were covered with paper-bark secured at
each end with twine made of human hair. The carving

was very distinct; the hollows much darker than the
surface. These “rain-makers” are so extremely rare
that I should certainly have secured one but that we
were in very difficult country, over 700 miles from
the overland telegraph-line—the nearest point of civilisa-
tion. These rain-makers, like the bull-roarers, are kept
out of the sight of the women, and no female can be pre-
sent during certain parts of the rain-making ceremony.
The N.Q. natives have a rain-making ceremony in which
a rock crystal is the great talisman. This is powdered
and then thrown up so as to fall over the assembled
women in imitation of rain, the women making pretence
to keep it off. In some of these rain-making ceremonies
the performers are adorned with feathers fixed on with
human blood, and a kind of chignon made of emu-feathers
is worn on the head. The sticks and stones used in these
functions are afterwards carefully wrapped in bark and
hidden away until again required for rain-making. In
one part of N.Q. there is used a “ rain-stick” about 2ft.
long, of light wood, with a gum knob decorated with
human hair, feathers, &c., the hair being from the beard
only. During one part of the rain-making all the per-
formers are in a waterhole, casting water over each other.
These sacred emblems, carved sticks and stones, are, as
far as I know, the only means the aboriginals have of
handing down their traditions otherwise than orally.

“ Steff ” : The Nelson (M.L.) people have
curious ways. They won’t argue. If you tell
them what a sleepy town it is, they will say
“ Yes ; isn’t it ! ” A funeral takes
nearly a whole day. Every male in
the town follows, and a rare
collection of belltoppers they
present! The ancient beaver
with the wool on and off,
the high chimney-pot with
a little brim, and the
Quaker with a big brim.
Weddings are rare; all
the young men clear out,
and the few eligibles left
are either cripples or whisky-
soakers. If you use the
telephone you must not give
the number ; you must name
the party you want, and the
exchange-girl will cheerfully
tell you whether he is in or out;
if latter, where he is, and when
he will be back. Asked a shop-
keeper if he had seen a certain
leading citizen about, and was
told to stand at a corner and I
would see the party going for his
morning beer. The town knew
he had never missed same for 20
years. You must take a tram (one-
horse antiquity) at starting-point,
and you cannot get out until terminus
is reached. Theatrical co’s have no show
(literally), because the residents won’t read their
posters or newspaper advts. If a commercial
traveller calls on a trader, latter always asks
when he is going back, so that he may possibly do
business at last moment. There are no rich
people and no poor; and Nelson is the cheapest
living place in the province.

“ Alpar ” : Out after cattle up Bnngendore
way, came, one wet evening, upon humpy occu-
pied by bleary-eyed shepherd, who invited me to
“ stay the night.” Had tea and damper without
exchanging a word —couldn’t get him to talk any-
how. Afterwards, when he had started cabbage-
tree hat plaiting, a pretty little kitten got playing
with the cabbage-tree stuff which trailed on the.
floor, and when the plaiter discovered that the
stuff was tangled, he seized the poor little creature
and pitched it into the fire, jamming it down with
his boot between two blazing logs. Tried to rescue
the miserable animal, but the infuriated fiend
faced me with a poker, and we got into “holts.”
He went down with his head against the edge of
an old camp-oven, and lay there dead to the world.
I went out, groped around for my horse, and
spent the night anyhow. Next morning, having
misgivings about kitten-killer’s condition, stole
back to within view of hut, and from behind tree
saw him, with head bandaged up, searching for
tracks. At head-station was told shepherd at
“Four-mile” was “ mad as a hatter.” Believed it!

man who owns and manages said property. Found him
most affable, and after going through a few of my refer-
ences (an armful of which are necessary these times) he
engaged me. He explained there were no stock at that
end of the run just now, and the fences all being new
would need little or no attention, so I would merely have

quantity of amber-colored sap
exudes. The busbies are very
fond of it. It is sweetish, and is
not an astringent. As far as I can

You are assuming that the three-days match limit is a

Toole’s check trousers, of late years, and it doesn’t wor-

but, as regards Lonnen and Barrett, anyway, Australia
certainly seemed lacking in superior intelligence ... V. :

AN OFFER TO THE GOVERNMENT.
Thn introduction of bis scheme would he hailed

where No vulgar music-hall tunes would be per-

the life of the people. .
If the Government would afford the opportunity,
the scheme could be brought into existence at

the simplest means. All that was required was a
violin, a flute, or even a penny whistle, either
alone or in conjunction with a piano, which would,
however, be a luxury. . . . .
If the Government would give him a single state

** ATTACKING THE DEVIL." ;
In view of tile interest excited by tile Rev. £
Sir. Gladstone’s recent utterances on the sub- £
ect of dancing, a representative of “ The „
Age’’called on Bishop Goe yesterday. The'
object of the interview was to ascertain, if i
possible, in what light the Nathalia clergy- ;
man is regarded by the head of his diocese. '
r * Do you then .approve of -M r. Gladstone’s •;
remarks ? ’* ;
, To this question Bishop-Goe thought it ; -
wonld be better not to give a direct reply.
He might say, however, that there were judi- J
(cions ways’o*f doing everything, and perhaps-
Mr. Gladstone had not chosen the best possible q
w ay. I
“ You would say then that his remarks^
were injudicious ? ”
“Yes. I might go as far as to say that.
‘Still you must acknowledge that he isS
attacking the devil.” k
The conversation came back to Mr. Glad-;
stone, and it was suggested that his remarks.';
did not apply only to Nathalia, and that they :
reflected upon all women who went to dances. I
Bishop Goe agreed that possibly they did, I
but repeated his conviction that Mr. Glad- j
stone was “ attacking the devil.” f

Curses Come Home to Roost.
S.O.B. gets a Great Truth off his chest:—
of rT e h01 i le * 0 roost '” during the inception
f Labor-party, in the years of the big-strikes,
K^i? o 0feSS1 ? na il classes of Sydney t( > a man cursed the
ukers, and ultimately strangled the whole movement.
froJ'uf P *J 1 doctor, pull lawyer; supply-and-demand,
freedom of-contract, natural order of tliings-and so on.
t 1 ' 1 ® natural order of things is still the motive power—
and lo . the grist is to those who were ground. They
ave been through the mill and are now applying the
process in turn to the miller. The working-man’s benefit
societies are employing doctors under freedom of con-
tract. Lowest tender gets the job, and the doctor-man
is crying aloud about medical sweating, demanding legis-
lative interference, and threatening to go on strike. It’s
sad—but the null won’t stop till the last bone is impal-
patiie dust and doctors are two-a-penny. Supply and
demand, eh ! Over 200 students at Sydney University
preparing to flood the pill-and-potion market and help
good old natural order of things to maintain freedom of
contract. Lawyers, too, are beginning to squeal. Can
be tee d at the police-courts for from 2s. 6d. and a beer
upwards. Lawyers will now undertake money-lenders’
work for nothing, and compete for it in the hopes of get-
tmg a pick out of borrowers. If you want to be divorced,
or file your schedule, or get damages for a broken heart
or legs or character, first catch a tout. He will negotiate
with the speculative, off-chance lawyers who are barely
eking outran existence, and you’ll get your business done
.' . , cu k -rates. Journalists, too, as befits the class
which was, in a large measure, trusted and followed, and
who betrayed the “ignorant mob,’’ are going through
this null. The open-letters lately published to the Syd-
ney press mostly sum-up merely to “sweating, sweating.”
Journalists’ brains are cheap, and cheap they must be—
Demos wants his paper for Id. And the press, with but
one or two honorable exceptions, cursed Demos and
played Judas kissing the multitude and taking the thirty
pieces of silver from Fatman. Natural-order-of-things
with his supply-and-demand sieve is dry-blowing a
profit out of the dust of the professions. Religion,
Law, and the rest of ’em are now in excess of
the demand, and their respective unions can no more
coerce the masses into paying standard rates than the
masses could force the “ clasess ” to pay ditto. And,
after all, there’s no such thing as the natural order of
things. It is only a verbal bogey—a ghost arranged to be
conjured up at will. “Supply and demand” and “freedom
of contract” also are mere spectres, and, like all the inven-
tions of men, become after a while common property.
Demos has learnt the charm, and now calls up the ghosts
to suit himself. Manual labor was in extremis seven
years back ; now it is mental, and the result is inevitable
mutual loss, the gain being mostly to the foreign and
local joint-stock incubii that have neither a belly to
starve nor a neck to twist. The time is about ripe for an
approachment between the two classes of laborers—for
the institution of a Labor-party that shall not be merely
a pick-and-shovel party. A party that will bury for ever
the old “natural order of things,” and start the new order
of things, and hang by the neck supply and demand,
and write-up large, on gaol, and gallows, and grave : “ The
laborer is worthy of his hire.” The present Labor-party
will always be a failure and a fraud while it sneers at the
civil-servant and truckles to the hobnailed-boot. It has
disgusted its best well-wishers by its paltry partisanship,
in the first place ; in the second, by its failure even to be
consistently partisan. Now the balance is hanging even.
All laborers all who work in any wav in contradistinction
to those who beg and thieve—have come to a pass
where the old party divisions and leaders are of no avail.
There is a big battle to fight, but “ Competition ’ won’t
be the watchword. The brain-worker must learn that
the old Un-Natural Order of Things which kept brain and
muscle in antagonism will have to go. As the manual-
labor unions were crushed, so the professional unions are
now being crushed. Absolute Freetrade, freedom of con-
tract, tree and unrestricted competition -all good cries—
and freedom in all of them. Freedom to be ground-down
small, freedom to starve, freedom to die—a sacrifice on
the altar of Cheapness. The curse heaved at the work-
ing-man by the professional man is being heaved back,
and by-and-by the order will be reversed, and ultimately
the curse will be always on the move till the only privilege
attached to being born will be that of dying, and so
escaping. But the curse is only a fiction at the best.
If Brain and Muscle will only join forces in a new and all-
embracing Labor-party;'they will have the—what’s better
than RLht—Might to heave the curse out into the abyss
in which lie already the other curses of established
religion, aristocratic privileges, divine right, and so on.

“ Old Soldier ” to The Bulletin : —
One of the recommendations of N.S.W. Charities Com-
mission is that the grants made by the Colonial Secre-
tary’s Office should be reduced. Quite right. They are
only one of the numerous ways of buying political sup-
port. The process is something like this. A distressed
elector goes to his member and explains that he is in
want. The member gives him a recommendation, in
warmth carefully proportioned to the man’s political
value as a supporter, addressed to “ Critchett Walker,
Esq., C.M.G., Principal Under-Secretary,” who instructs
the accountant to give the man from 10s. to LI,
proportioned to the vigor of the recommendation.
No inquiry is made into the circumstances of the
case. It is simply a bit of political patronage.
Then there are the subsidised electorate benevolent
societies. A few pounds are raised, then the member
asks for a subsidy and gets it. Relief-tickets are printed
and distributed, entitling the applicants to so much
groceries, bread, and meat from shops in the electorate.
The circumstances of individual cases are seldom en-
quired into. As often as not the relief-tickets are merely
rewards for political support and are given to people who
are not in distress at all. The local shopkeepers, who
take it in turn to supply the goods, profit. Their accounts
are paid monthly by the society, and they bless their
member who, by getting the subsidy, has so far increased
their trade, for if the relief were given in money instead
of in kind, the recipients might give their custom to
shops outside the electorate. In order to keep up this
rotten system, the Charities’ Department, which gives
nothing without due enquiry, is starved.

before Judge Williams at Melb. Practice Court, read very
unfairly to the wife who lived with him for 13 years. The
par. omitted many of the facts and mangled others. It
said, “ Barrister Gregory has for years been shut up in
the asylum,” which is not a fair way of stating that
whereas the confinement started only three years ago,
the patient has been more than once released on proba-
tion at his wife’s request, and found to be a dangerous
monomaniac on each occasion. Then there is the absurd
statement—” One day, it is alleged, he was seized with
hallucinations, and several doctors certified to his in-
sanity. Among other things, it was said, he believed
people wanted to rob him of his documents ; that he
bolted and barred his house till his wife became afraid to
stay in the same house with him, and that he believed he
was being drugged. At any rate, he was put into
the asylum, and his appearance before the court
arose out of a big effort on his part to get
out.” Does your disingenuous informant want
to persuade the public that Mr. Gregory suffered
from a rush of hallucinations on one day and was next
day popped into the asylum ? The unfortunate man’s
delusions had long been a matter of common knowledge
among friends and acquaintances of the family. His
cranky barricading of his dwelling-house had gone on for
years, and he had made at least one serious attempt on
the life of Mrs. Gregory, whom he insanely suspected of
trying to poison him. Your paragraph said : “ For two
hours this alleged lunatic argued his case with a force and
soundness rarely exhibited in the Vic. courts ... he pro-
perly pointed out that his wife had her remedy at law
other than by having him committed to an asylum. She
could have obtained a judicial separation. Judge Wil-
liams was against Gregory right through, and, after
five hours’ argument, simply said he could not go
in the face of the medical evidence.” Just so.
Judge Williams, who doubtless knew more about
Gregory’3 ca«e than appeared in the “argument,”
dealt as gently as possible with the poor lunatic. Judge
Ilolroyd heard the same “argument” when Gregory
came before him on a previous writ of habeas, and he dis-
posed of the application in the same quiet way. It is
true that Gregory talked rationally for two hours at the
outset. Afterwards his brain trouble was painfully
apparent; he charged his long-suffering wife with having
made up her mind to poison him, basing his “ argument”
on the allegation that she came from a certain district
where husband-poisoning is epidemic. The Judge didn’t
need any medical evidence to convince him of Gregory’s
lunacy. The poor fellow gave it away in his “ argument,.”
Also, he gave awav the fact that he would be likely to
njJn lf^ e o ° uld > whenever his monomania took a 1
to if v,y h . afc * 00d would a judicial separation be
her the vfntim n, v, a K d „ We - e asain afc liberfc y to make
fl 1 f i*- 18 hallu cinations ? And if she had
as P vlum and S h?d' at , IOn ’ !, nstead of committing him to an
miVhf d # h d u C ’ eared out °f the country that she
Tn'« h ~ fee S i afe ’ ' vh ? t would have happened to Gregory?
a F en ®!' al of way he thinks everybody wants to
murder him. He isn’t fit to be at large.-X.

Extract from a schoolboy’s essay on “ the
Turks ”:—
Among the Turks each man may have a great number
of wives shut up in harems, but among white men each
nus iana can onty have one wife. Learned men call the
first system polygamy, and the second they call mono-
tony.

Printed that there is a hereditary curse on
the Beauchamp family—that if the holder of the
title is an eldest son, his eldest son never grows up
to inherit. The present earl is an eldest son,
though his predecessor wasn’t; so, if he marries
and raises a family, the curse, which has been off
duty lately, will presently leave its card at the
front door once more. Ever since the family
started, it is alleged, the good old curse has
dropped in sociably every third generation or so,
and attended to its business, and gone away again.
No one knows where it lives when it is off duty
for it isn’t even mentioned in the directory, but*
judging by its punctuality, it is a sort of large in-
visible worm always dwelling on the threshold.
That’s how the story goes, anyhow.
A Maorilander writes to the Mail (Wel-
lington, M.L.) on N.S.W.’s way of running a
Parliament: —
The debate did not interest me—it could not well in-
terest anybody—but it served to shovfc me how weak,
how pathetically weak, is the rule of ‘Sr. Speaker ” in
N.S.W. Legislative Assembly. Five ctt six members
would speak at once; one would rise from his seat and
rush up to the foot of the table and excitedly address
the Speaker on an alleged point of order. He did not
even define his point of order, or try to, but wandered
off into side channels, mostly containing a turgid flow of
condemnation of the Government. Other members
would then “chip in,” until it seemed as if Babel
itself were let loose. Then the long, gaunt form
of Joseph Abbott would rise from the Speaker’s
chair, and the so - called guardian of the digni-
ties of the House would blandly and mildly “bleat”
out—“ bleat” is the only suitable expression—something
like this : “Really, gentlemen, if honorable gentlemen
continue to make these continual interjections and inter-
ruptions, it is impossible for me to maintain due order,”
and so forth. Then would come a lull for a few minutes,
and then Babel again. O, for a few minutes of Maurice
O’Rorke ! What a time, what a remarkably disagreeable
time, of it the plugless word-spouts of the Sydney House
would have could Maurice only occupy the Chair for a
day or two. Why, the rowdiest of our scenes on this side
are milk-and-water as compared with what is almost of
daily occurrence in Sydney.
A Sudden Change May Be Counted
Upon.
We are grateful for a change from a hot north
wind to a cool south breeze in summer, but more
grateful for an assurance of a change for the better
guaranteed when suffering from a headache, a
pain in the back, or inability to properly digest
food. This change always promptly follows the
use of Warner’s Safe Cure, and but a short treat-
ment is necessary to drive away all symptoms of
biliousness and invigorate the liver to its normal
wonted activity.
A CHURCH OFFICER
of the West Melbourne Presbyterian Church
recommends Warner’s Safe Cure “ I was
prostrated with liver disease, which caused a
coating of the tongue, a bitter taste in the mouth,
bilious headaches, dizziness, loss of appetite, fre-
quent nausea, sickness, and continual drowsiness.
I seemed completely prostrated and absolutely
broken down. I followed the advice of two good
physicians, but they failed to relieve me. Then I
procured and took Warner’s Safe Cure, and im-
provement was soon manifest. I continued until
I had used three bottles, when I was quite restored
to health.
“ The acquaintances and friends I may have
made during my forty-six years’ residence in Vic-
toria, know that my natural conservatism would
deter me from praising a remedy unless thor-
oughly convinced of its merits.

The Commercial World (London) writes re-
garding' the Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society i —
‘ We always confidently anticipate a good year from this

therefore, that the figures for 1897 show no falling away
from the steady and substantial progress which is inse-
parably connected with the Society’s past career occasions
us no surprise. As a .matter of fact, the Society earns its
success I>\ deserving it, and, that much being conceded,
the best possible has been said for the continuance of the
large measure of public support which it has hitherto
fallen to fortunate lot to receive.” Pleasant reading.*

Captain Miles, the new Tas. Minister for
Railways, immediately on taking office was greeted
with a Parliamentary assertion that —
The Tas. railways are conducted under a system of
Sp J e \ lnformers * and favori tes, under which honest men
who have done faithful service are degraded, and men
who have done no sufficient service are promoted.
As Hartnoll, an ex-Minister, makes the charge, an
official enquiry is to be held. But there is always
more than a suspicion in such cases that employes
who give evidence will be duly rewarded for telling
the truth, so the result will probably be a com-
plete vindication of present local railway-methods.
Vic. Full Court has dealt a serious blow
to the landowners who steal roads in the Cabbage
Garden. Under the Vermin Destruction Act
any infected district may be “ proclaimed,” and
thereafter any landlord may, with the local
council’s permission, enclose his land with one
continuous fence and put swing gates across the
roads. The gates are, ostensibly, to prevent the
spread of vermin. In reality, they are to save the
landlord the expense of fencing his land off along
the road, and to give him the road between gates
as extra grazing-area. But in his haste to grab
the profit it often happened that he took possession
of roads in districts that were not “proclaimed,”
and an order with costs against E. Loddon shire
council, to open up several dozen unlawfully closed
roads, has made that body sit up with a shock.
When the Federal majority passed the
second reading of the Enabling Bill in Q. Leg.
Council, ex-Premier Nelson “protested against
the coercive tactics of the Govt.”; also Brisbane
Telegraph said the Bill was pushed through by
“brute force.” Time that idiotic phrase was
abolished. Every Act is passed by the brute
force of the majority; it must be so unless the
country is prepared to leb laws be made or unmade
by the brute force of the minority. Also every
Govt, with a majority uses “ coercive tactics ” ;
the country must either be run by the coercive
tactics of the Govt, majority or of the Opposition
minority.. The “ noble democratic principle that
the majority must govern ” and the “brute force
of a degraded Govt, relying on mere numbers to
stifle opposition ” are just the same thing—only
one is the back view and the other is the front.
A whole week was spent in Tas. Assembly
trying to find out whether E. T. Miles was a
Ministerialist or an Oppositionist before he got
the post of Lands Minister. Now, the man who
can sit so long and steadily on a rail that some
men sitting beside and around him are ready to
swear he .was a virulent Oppositionist,, while others,
also sitting close up against him for years, call
£-eaven to witness that he would have cleaned
Braddon s boots, is a man of mighty mind and
JV 1 ' thomable possibilities. It came out in debate
that Miles advised Fysh to go Home as Agent-
General, and people suppose the wily old shell-
back took a lunar as he made the proposal, and
meant to take Fysh’s billet as Treasurer. But
.Premier Braddon wanted the Fysh-bones for him-
self. Stall, luck was very good to Miles. Just as
*l®,y as f° tack for the Opposition again,
Jrillinger died, and Braddon beckoned to the
syndicate-man to come aboard and take Pillinger’s
The Bulletin has before it a copy of a
“ newspaper’’—the Catfish Budget,
edited by Catfish.” It is issued by a man in
tbe fishing-tackle business, and prints leading
articles about “ sollicking black bream.” It’s one
big advt. relates to the goods of the fishing-tackle
man. And the “ news ” (all designed to induce
people to buy the proprietor’s fishing-tackle and
hang a worm on the end thereof, and proceed to
get cold in a boat) consists of items like these :
At Woy Woy, on Saturday night last, Messrs. W.
Beaumont and L. Holdsworth, piloted by Walter
Stewart, landed 49 fish, weighing 501bs. On Sunday a
strong southerly came up, accompanied by thick rain,
consequently no fishing’ was done.
At the Hawkesbury, on Queen’s birthday, A. E. Martin,
, R r rs > and R ‘ E ‘ Eastway caught 12 good flathead,
2 black bream, 1 shark, 1 eel, and 20 catfish.
9\t T- Friend landed a splendid jewfish off the
wharf at Newcastle the other day.
l^ r - D. .Jones, of Wallsend, caught, at Newcastle, during
the month of May, 100 black bream.
Fred. Couohe and mate have been getting some real
blue-nose black bream at the Rip in the day-time. Some
of the breamers should try Woy Woy for the big darkies.
And this tradesman’s circular is carried through
the post at the expense of the N.S.W. taxpayer as
a newspaper!”
“ Germans are knocking out the British
all over China,” writes a Bulletin correspondent
from that country. “Last week a German co.
bought all Holt s blue-funnel steamers, eleven in
number, which trade between Singapore and the
islands. Tn Hongkong, Germans almost run the
show, and now have three directors out of seven
in Hongkong and Shanghai Bank—the wealthiest

foreign bank in China. In Shanghai their num-
bers .increased last year from 1304 to 1910, the
Umglish going from 3618 to 3670 only. German
goods increased in one year 76 per cent., while
British declined 4 per cent; and even the English
insurance co’s are represented in Shanghai by
German firms. Teutons have long supplanted
Britishers in the Govt, arsenals, military camps
THE LOST SOUL.
“ And as night gathered, I dangled through the
castellated abkorrum, and there teas very little of
me. And as I passed the nethermost summit, upon
which rested the dead world, the she-dog materialized
and yapped at me with noiseless hark. But I heeded
not, and dapped o[?]ards, wonderiny where I could
find myself.”—From the “ Microhalos ” of Schez

and navy. In the cotton-mills che Japs, have
ousted the Manchester men, but Britishers still
run the Customs-house.”
Maoriland’s Auditor-General is a punc-
tilious person, and he and Premier Seddon are
often at loggerheads. One row they had over a
penny stamp lasted 13 months. A Govt, sur-
veyor began the trouble by sending in a demand
for 555., coach-fare. He forwarded at the same
time the coach-proprietor’s receipt for the fare,
but it was unstamped. It was sent back to be
stamped. It was sent* back again because the
stamp wasn’t cancelled on the day u hen the re-
ceipt was given. The surveyor got a new receipt
properly stamped, but it was rejected because it
didn’t bear the same date as the first receipt. The
surveyor got a third receipt, but it was rejected
because there was another discrepancy about the
date on the stamp. The matter was referred to
Minister Cadman, and he referred it indignantly
to the Cabinet. The Cabinet ordered that the
money should be paid. The Paymaster refused to
part in view of the hostile attitude of the Auditor.
The surveyor wrote to the coach-proprietor for
another receipt, and the latter replied that if a
receipt that would satisfy the Auditor was sent
along he would sign it—that he was mad-enough to
sign anything by this time. About a dozen letters
were exchanged hereabouts, in some of which the
Audit Department reflected severely on the
flippant attitude of the coach-proprietor, and his
unbecoming language, and evident inability to
appreciate the gravity of the situation. The
matter was again referred to the Cabinet. The
Cabinet requested the Solicitor-General to draw
up such a legal and absolutely cast iron receipt
that the Auditor-General couldn’t possibly reject
it. And at last another receipt was drawn up and
signed by the tired, infuriated coach-proprietor, and
the auditor passed it with a long letter of high
official curse about the irregular nature of the whole
business. And then some restless member added
the spire and dome to the whole lofty aggravation
by getting Parliament to order that the corres-
pondence be printed. It was printed accordingly.
Maonland has been using language quite unfit to
be printed ever since.

Another advantage with these strips

the life of the tyre considerably length-

These strips can be obtained from all respectable

The Oldest-Established Pharmacy in
Australia.
Mr. C. E. Newman, the present proprietor
of the above establishment, is one of the leaders
in the recent new movement made by the most
progressive of Sydney’s chemists for ensuring
public health and welfare. The newly-formed
Pharmacists’ Society aims at bringing the chemists
into unison for the public benefit. It is well
known that many a doctor’s patient progresses
very slowly, or even dies, not through the doctor’s
fault, nor through the patient’s fault, but simply
because the drugs used in preparing the doctor’s
prescriptions are too old to retain their efficacy ;
while another reason is that the drugs are dis-
pensed by incompetent people. Mr. Newman is
one of those chemists who is determined to abolish
these evils. He intends raising the status and pro-
ficiency of chemists’ assistants and employes, so
that the dispensing of drugs and the general work
of a chemist’s establishment shall be conducted on
safer and more thorough lines. The handling of
poisons only by persons legally qualified as under-
standing poisons is another rule that Mr. New-
man wants to see enforced. At the first big
meeting of the new society Mr. Newman, in a short
and able speech, gave the toast of the Press, and
hoped that thatenlightened institution would afford
itssympatheticaid to the good cause undertaken by
his brother chemists and himself. Mr. Newman’s
pharmacy in King-street, Sydney, is a remarkably
handsome and spacious establishment, located in
the centre itself of the city, and fitted with a style

and repleteness that would do justice to the first
pharmacy of London or New York. Such com-
forts as a ladies’ waiting-room and a ladies’ pareel-
and-cloak room prove a thorough boon to the fair
sex. Then, too, a private apartment with latest
books of reference is here for medical gentlemen
desiring to hold consultations in town, and a cap-
able analyst is also at their service. The dispens-
ing dept., which is replete with all the latest pre-
parations, and is equipped with a highly efficient
staff, is under Mr. Newman’s personal supervision.
All infusions, tinctures, &c., are made inhis own
laboratory. Medicines are delivered punctually
to all parts of the city and suburbs, and medical
gentlemen, customers and hospitals requiring any-
thing urgently can telephone their requirements
and receive same without delay. Mr. New-
man’s stock of surgical and hospital requisites is
most modern and complete, while the prices are
reform prices that extend to every department of
his unique establishment. A feature which is cer-
tain to attract many ladies is the retreat that the
shop affords from the dust and noise of the street,
especially as a perfumery-fountain is spraying the
richest perfumes within. The business that now
bears Mr. Newman s name is the oldest-established
pharmacy jn Australia ; and has long had a repu-
tation for its grand assortment of English, Ameri-
can, and French perfumes, face-powders, hair-
preparations, fact ions, creams, &c. Mr.
Newman is sole agent for Messrs. Hackshall and
Co. s almond meal and biscuits and cocoa-nut
meal and biscuits for sufferers from diabetes. The
pharmacy is open from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. (Sundays
aiu l holidays included).

A Cure for Miners’ Lead Poisoning.
A MOST IMPORTANT MATTER TO ALL
MINERS.
Hay Street, Perth,
19th May, 1899.
Mr. S. A. PALMER, “ Yitadatio Institute,” Perth.
Sir,—Just a few lines to express to you my thanks for
the recovery of my health, which is due to the use of your
“ Vitadatio!” While working in the Broken Hill mines I
contracted Lead Poisoning, which brought on a discharge
of blood through the bowels, and left me in such a state
that it became impossible for me to follow my occupation
of an engine-driver, or, in fact, to do any work at all.
Luckily for me, you brought this wonderful medicine
to West Australia, and I was persuaded to try it. I have
taken about ten bottles ; the discharge of blood has en-
tirely stopped, and I am feeling altogether a new man,
and can once more enjoy a life free from pain, to which I
have been a stranger so long. Once more thanking you,
Mr. Palmer,
I am, faithfully yours,
JAMES TAYLOR.

A Cure for Cancer—Positive Cure.
Mr. S. A. PALMER, 45-47 Bourke St., Melbourne.
I give you permission to make known to the public that
my wife has been cured of a Fleshy Cancerous Growth
under the tongue by the use of Yitadatio. The growth
was there for two years.
Yours sincerely,
F. B. GOODWIN.
No. 3 Wicklow St., South Yarra.
Note. —Mr. Goodwin and Mrs. Goodwin called person-
ally at the “ Vitadatio Institute,” and with gratefulness
tendered the above testimonial. Mrs. Goodwin has con-
sulted many doctors and tried many medicines, but was
getting no relief. Operation was talked of, and those who
have undergone such can readily understand and sympa-
thise with that. No operation was necessary with “ Vita-
datio.” Mrs. Goodwin assures Mr. Palmer that she will
gladly see anyone similarly affected, or will send particu-
lars by letter to anyone desirous of knowing about her
case—enclosing stamps for reply. The family are thank-
ful for the cure, and desire, out of gratitude and from a
sense of duty, to make it known.

A CUKE FOE CANCER, GALL-STONES, AND JAUNDICE.
A WOED OP COMFORT TO LADIES.
Rosslyn Street, Middle Brighton, Victoria, 29th May, 1899.
Mr S A PALMER, Vitadatio, Bourke Street, Melbourne. . , . , , ...
Dear Si. -I wish lo make known to you and those who may be suffering that Vitadatio has cured my wife of a
most serious trouble, viz., “severe pains in stomach and spasms over the heart’s region.’
The best doctors were ..or,suite.], and stated the trouble was “Cancer, Gallstones and Jaundice,” and that
nothing could be done save “ an operation," winch, in her emaciated condition, we declined.
The doctor could only assist her in her great agony by administering Morphia and Chloroform, which only gave
temporary] rebef.^r v y ITADATI o for her. She took 13 bottles. And is now better than she has been for many years.
You may use this statement as you choose; other sufferers may thereby receive blessing as we have.
Yours truly,
S. B. WALCOT.
I need make no comment on the above. The saved ones speak with no uncertain sound.
Their praise is sweet music, and their desire to benefit others is an acknowledgment of the “ Golden Rule.’
“ Do unto others as we would they should do unto us.”
Ever yours gratefully,
S. A. PALMER,
VITADATIO, Melbourne.
A Cure for what Defeated the Doctors
Spring-hurst, Victoria, 30th May, 1899.
I Mr. PALMER, Melbourne.
Dear Sir, —I have been a fearful sufferer for. the past
four or five years. One doctor would not treat me. He
said I was too far gone. Another doctor gave me up, and
another said he could do nothing for me ; and I was con-
sidered to be in a state of collapse. The doctors called it
a general breakdown of the system, my age being 68 next
birthday.
During my illness I took some 30 bottles of one adver-
tised medicine, five bottles of another, seven bottles of
another, and two jars of another ; and, as regards doctors’
medicines, I really took same until I was sick and tired.
Upon reference to any of my neighbors they can tell you
how bad I was.
I have now taken eight bottles of your VITADATIO,
and feel better than I have for years. I can get about and
do my work, and have a good appetite, and I must can-
didly acknowledge, with gratefulness, that your VITA-
DATIO put me on my feet, and it’s the only medicine that
has ever done me any good.
You are at liberty to use my name if you wish.
Yours gratefully,
Springhurst. EZEKIEL M'CANN.
[Memo, from S. A. Palmer: —The above magnificent
voluntary testimony has just come to hand, and has been
certified by Mr. D. H. M'Guinness, Wangaratta, either of
whom will gladly answer any inquiries or help other suf-
ferers with particulars if a stamp is sent for reply.]
“ The Quality of Goodness is Not
Strained.”
“ It is the elements of character —trustworthiness, faith-
ful industry, self-control, and kindred virtues —which
must enter into labor to purify and exalt and make it of
real worth to mankind.”
No Sham about Vitadatio.
Hinton, 127 Canterbury Road,
Toorak, Bth June, 1899.
Mr. PALMER.
Dear Sir,—Please accept my grateful thanks for the
good my little girl has received from your most wonderful
medicine, Vitadatio. She is now taking the second bottle,
and I am sure by the time that is finished she will be
quite cured.—Yours truly,
Hinton, Toorak. Mrs. J. JOHNSON.

* * gaining a very high reputationln England for Removing Scurf, Arresting the Premature Decay of the Hair, and giving it a Luxuriant Appearance Mr M‘Laren.the famous cricketer, has proved
it to D 1 superior to all the Hair Restorers manufactured in England. What the English preparations failed to do m his case has been accomplished by HOLLAND S FAMOUS RESTORER. One of
Australians fairest daughters writes from England, saying that her hair was falling out most alarmingly, and she could not procure anything there to do it any good In her extremity she turns her eyes to
the land of her birth and there she beholds a preparation which has proved so effective in the past, not only in her case, but thousands of others she was intimately acquainted with, and she hastens to
send for a supply of this splendid preparation. This preparation was used in Fifteen Countries before one shilling was spent on advertising it. What testimonial could be superior to that, and what better
guarantee could people desire that it will prove effective in their case? Please remember that it is the result of twenty-two years of assiduous study of the Hair and its Treatment, and it is now being used
fn nearly every house in the aristocratic suburb of Toorak. If your hair is weak or falling off, scurf is forming on the scalp, or the hair is putting on the frosty hues of age, or you are afflicted with any
“ disease of the scalp causing the hair to fall off m patches, loss of eye-brows, beard and moustache,
don’t use deleterious compounds manufactured by bald-headed quacks, but use preparations put
together by a person whose skill in this line of study has been endorsed by the leading medical men
of the day.
This is a Splendid Preparation for Re-
moving Scurf, Promoting the Growth, and
giving Lustre to the Hair. Every person
desirous of preventing their hair from falling
off, and securing a luxurious head of hair,
should use RESTORER.
Ladies should use it on their children, as
it is perfectly harmless, and will positively
secure to them a good head of hair.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The British footballers showed themselves a
p°od team on Saturday last, when playing 1 in the slush
on Sydney Cricket Ground, considering that their only
previous.game together had been at Goulburn. Whilst
their condition lasted the Britishers made a splendid
showrng against the locals, but towards the end condition
failed and they were dead to the world; it was only
their dogged pluck that enabled them to show such ex-
cellent defence. The visitors just scored a win by 4
points to 3.

tlemen amateurs, and there is to be no roughin-,” and

It will be a thousand pities if the English foot-
ballers cannot include Maoriland, where, if anywhere
the game is the national one. It is understood that the
M.L. union will guarantee £303 for two matches in Auck-
land and Wellington. Otago and Canterbury will not
join any general guarantee, b it will each guarantee £2OO
for ain itch in Dunedin. Surely it would be worth the
Englishmen’s while. Meanwhile, Maorilanders note with
grim satisfaction that a team worth beating could be gob
together from old Maorilanders now in Sydney.
* * • *
Mayor M'Eacharn, Melb., evidently considers
himself no end of a devil of a fellow, and broke out, before
the parson-conducted British team of footballers, with a
splenetic condemnation of the game as she is played in
Melbourne, mainly because young men coming from the
grounds are heard to swear in tram-cars, &c. This makes
footballers snigger. As a matter of fact, it is the ex-
cessive mildness of the Vie. game that has knocked all the
gut off it of late years. The profane and picturesque
barrackers cannot be stirred by the spectacle afforded by
40 amiable young men exchanging amenities on a bi«-
field, and they stay away. The Rugby game the Mayor
gushed over, as pla3 r ed in England, is simply hell-for-
leather, and catches-on because its back-aching, shin-
biffing qualities have not been legislated out of it. The
trouble with Vic. football is Respectability and Decorum,
and the rediculous longevity of umpires. ' Blood will tell
—especially in the “ gate.”
• * * .
A wild howl went up from the Melb. barraekers
on the M.O.G. on Saturday, when the S. Melb. footballers
unexpectedly ran over the local team in the first, part of
the game. The supporters of Melb. loudly wailed that
their men had been squared, that they were “dead,” and
that they ought to be wiped out for life. Then Melb. got
its second wind, scored gradually, and eventually were
two goals ahead of South. The'game ended with Melb.
victors and the same old howling mob of one-eyed
barraekers shaking hands with them as noble fellows.
Melb. and Fitzroy are now nearly level for the premier-
ship.
* • * *
They take their football seriously in England.
After the Sheffield team had won the English cup last
month, the surgeon specialist who patches up all the
crippled athletes of the county declared that one of the
full backs had played in the last three matches with two
broken ribs and a ruptured side. “ I patched him up for
the semi-final with over 50 yards of starched bandages,
and several thick pads. For to-dav’s match I strapped
him up at the hotel; he was well rubbed down, and
enveloped in bandages from waist to chest, and
dressed in his football clothes before going to
the ground, for had any of the Derby forwards
known what was the matter with him,', he would
not have played a minute, and Derby would have won
the Cup. A touch on the spot would have laid .him out.
Half-time came and he was still unharmed. I had a
special room for him, cut some of the bandages off, and
gave him a bottle of Champagne. As they were going-
out a Derby man said to me," ‘ It’s all rot about"your
cripple. He’s all right. He kicks all right, hut he won’t
meet me face to face like a man, but always turns his
back to me.’ At last the end came. Sheffield had wen,
and my man was untouched. He got into his room and
collapsed entirely, arid when we ent the wrappings away
he was entirely black and blue, with a lump as big as my
fist protruding from his side.”
* • * *
The Australian XI. are piling up records at
’Ome. In three consecutive matches they have made
over 400 runs, and in 17 completed innings 10 individual
centuries have been made—Hill three, Gregory two
Noble two, Trumper, Darling, and Worrall one each.
* * » *
Wilfred Rhodes, the English bowler, who has
played in th? first two tests against Australia, is only 22
in Oct. next. He is a slow bowler with high, easy action ;
accuracy his chief point. When the wickets are treacher-
ous Rhodes does as much damage as either Turner or
Ferris in their best days. A noticeable weakness in
English howling this season, however, is the absence of a
fast trundler such as Richardson was.
« * • »
Lilley, the Warwickshire wicketkeeper, who
displaced Storer in the second test, is always reckoned
by Australians to he the one “ keeper ” who can be com-
pared with Blackham in the latter’s best. days. Geo.
Giffen describes the catch made by Lilley whereby he
dismissed Clem Hill off Richardson at short-stop, in one
of the tests played by the 1893 team, as the best\thing he
has seen in his cricket career. Lilley is 32 years old.
* * * *
Since the cricket-match between Mar-ylebone
C.C. and Australia, the bakblox has been much exercised
as to whether Albert Trott really played for England or
Australia. Many swear it looked as if he played for
Australia.
* * * «
Evidently the conservatism of Marylebone club
got a violent shaking from English critics after the first
test-match, which would account for the inclusion of
Meade in the All-England Eleven last Week. The Bulle-
tin (June 10) commented on the fact that Meade “ had
made good averages against three or four successive
Australian teams.” Now that, the Essex man is in his
30th year, and his bowling has lost much of its dangerous
novelty for some of the Australian XI., the M.C.C. picks
him as a representative player—on the “ better late than
never ” principle. Another new feature in M.C.C.
tactics was the stipulation that Jackson and Rhodes
shouldn’t play for Yorkshire county against the Austra-
lians immediately previous to the second test. The fact
that the county committee acquiesced in this arrange-
ment shows how the wind of cricket opinion is blowing
in the old country. Public faith in the “old reliable”
bowlers has been knocked over the pavilion by Darling &
Co. Cotnmonsense asks for young men, and wants them
to be new and kept strange to the Australian batsmen.
Also, conservatism has consented to sacrifice its W. G.
Grace, the 18st. captain who is fully 10 years too old for
his position at point in the field, and who has suffered
from absurd prejudices all his life. Times out of number
uraee showed himself to be an indiscreet captain,
judging- batsmen and bowlers not by their form of the
moment but by their average form. If the tenth man
«ere to make 100 runs, Grace would send him in tenth
again next innings, and if his best bowler (on averages)
were getting' badly punished, Grace was always the last
person on the ground to perceive the folly of expecting
the pasted one to take wickets presently.
* * * *
Oxford and Cambridge boys have given
scientific cricket a knock that it will never quite
recover from. Their rapid and effective batting, coming
immediately before and after the first test-match, evi-
nm-y J ns,j ' re<: * tlle Yorkshiremen to buck up, for
although the Australians on the first day were not all out
until after luncheon, the county scored 229 runs before
stumps were drawn. And next day our boys plaved the
game of making runs whilst the sun shines ; but how
pathetic were the comments of the precious old “ex-
perts” who employ their cricket lore in padding the
cable reports for Australian dailies ! Take a quotation
from Melb. Argus : “ Gregory, as in the first innings,
came to the rescue of the side in first-rate style, and he
and Worrall put on runs fast. The Victorian, being under
the impression that the wicket was unsuitable for the
correct game, started to hit brilliantly.” Ye gods ! Wor-
rall’s incorrect game produced 104 runs !
* * * *
Delightful slab of impartial criticism on the
Yorkshire match, from S.M. Herald “in the bowling,
.Noble, with six for 83 and six for 86, appears to have kept
a good length right through the match. Hirst’s figures
were better (13 for 149), but, as before pointed out, the
wicket when he secured eight for 48 must have given him
assistance ;if not, then he bowled remarkably well. It
very rarely happens that a bowler secures two wickets
with his first two deliveries such as Noble did in the
second innings.”
* * • *
“J". T. Brown sen.,” as they call him now, is
about 25, so J. T. Brown jun., if any relation at all, is
presumably his cousin or nephew. Brown’s two innings
(for Yorkshire) of 84 and 166 were not more than might
have been expected of the little man who won the fifth
test-match for Stoddart’s team in Australia four years
ago. He was one of the mainstays of that team from first
to last—a splendid field at point, and always a lively
batsman on a fast wicket—the faster the better for Brown.
As a rule, he waits for the ball and “knocks it off the
wicket,” but he can play the other game equally well
when he feels like hitting. Although a reputedly un-
certain batsman, Brown didn’t have many bad days in
Australia when the turf was hard. He started by scoring
a three-figures innings against South Australia in the first,
game of the tour, which was perhaps a better perform-
ance than his sensational score in the fifth test-match
aforesaid. The Australian bowling happened to be
“ tripe ” on that momentous occasion (said Brown), and
the only credit he claimed was for discovering the
“ tripeyness ” of Giffen, M’Kibbin, and the two Trotts,
and treating them with active and intelligent contempt.
Tfie extraordinary thing is that little Brown
should not have been chosen for the All-England team,
even at the last moment. During this season he has
made an innings (cabled) of 300 not out for his county,
and against the Australians he scored 250 in two attempts.
• • * •
Seems that Hirst, the left-handed Yorkshire
bowler, acquired his stodginess in Australia, and has
since been engaged in ridding himself of superfluous fat.
It was a comparatively lean Hirst who bowled so well
against the Australians last week.
* » • •
In Sydney, young Trumper’s 135 not out was
received with enthusiasm second only to Australia’s win
of the second test-match by 10 wickets. Trumper has
been disappointingly low on the average-list, and had a
bit of iuck in getting a show at all in the match, for had
Iredale not been down with measles, on performances
Trumper must have stood out.
* * * •
When Ranji was here he prophesied that
Trumper would develope into a better bat than Hill at
his best. It was a coincidence that Hill and Trumper
both made 135 in the second test-match, but with his
“ not out ” Trumper came on top. Trumper’s 135 not
out has lifted him in the averages from 9th to sth, and,
despite his bad beginning, it would be unsafe to lay long
odds against his being very close to top at the tour’s endt
* * * *
Curious that match after match Bill Howell!
gets a wieket or two—always good ones—at the begin-
ning of the innings, but does no good with the ball later
on. His damaged leg ?
* * * *
The cable mentioned that the fielding of York-
shire was “a trifle lax” in each innings of the Austra-
lians last week. Then it must have been bad.
* * * *
A queer game of cricket was recently played
between two N.S.W. country teams. The schoolmaster
and the local crack began batting and ran up 101, when
the latter was dismissed for 44. Innings closed for 110,
“ Schooley” getting 57, not-out, every other player om
the side registering “ a blob,” and sundries accounting
for 9. Opposing side all dismissed for 35, by the two run-
getters, no other man on that side even getting a catch.
• * * *
The Melb. newspapers never stuck up cricket
announcements on Sunday till last Day of Best, when
they hung out the news of the Cambridge victory.
* * * *
Cabled that Roche and Nicholls, for Middlesex
v. Kent, put up a record for the 10th wicket, raising the
score from 55 to 230. Roche, who made 74 (not out), is.
the ex-Victorian who made his mark in bowling in recent
interprovincial matches. His command over the ball is
attributed to a mutilated hand caused by a blasting-
accident, which, however, prevents him being a first-
class bat. But he can score sometimes. Roche and
Halloran, two M.C.C. professional ground bowlers, and!
picked as such, electrified a Melb. crowd, in a match v.
South Australia a few seasons back, when the pair for the
ninth wicket, aided by Johns for the 10th, added 200 to
what was a very meagre total.
* * * *
The Y.R.C. Grand Nationals look like, falling
into wealthy hands this year. The Miller stable has a
reasonable show for the double event with, Lramoo and
Hayseed; the Manifolds have their Soult kindly handi-
capped for the Hurdle race, and squatter, Russell's good
old Domino will have a great go in the Steeple if fully
wound up. Among the light weights in the G.N. Hurdle
there are a couple—Clamorous and Valdis—trained by
Mark Whitty, who brought off two surprises with Buzzi
for this event in successive years. A dangerous novice
is City Band (list. 51bs.), the Tas. nag that won a six
furlong flat-race on Steeplechase day last year. City
Band is said to jump as brilliantly as he sprints, and he
is well-bred.

Basso’s fall at Moonee Valley, last Saturday,
was a cruel blow to backers. He was heavily supported’,
and came down the straight 50 lengths in'front. The-
money looked as good as collected, whi n the big horse
clouted at the last fence and fell. Old Judge, who hai
filled second place in almost every race on record, came,
along and won, to the rapture of the ring.

The Glendon Hurdle, at Moonee Valley (Vic.),,
on Saturday, is a fine example of tote and book prices,
respectively. Five to four was the best that could be got
on the course within half an hour of starting, yet the
Collingwood tote paid backers of Soult evens on the place
totes and three to one bn the straight-out.
Rupert Clarke, when in Adelaide, tried hard!
to secure Gungadin, Crozier’s chesnut colt, far and away
the best youngster seen in S.A. for years, and greatly
fancied for V.R.C. Derby'. Crozier refused an offer of
£6OO.

Mr. Buokland evidently means that Valiant
shall take Van Cleve’s place at the stud when the old
horse’s day is done, and in the Juvenile Stakes at Canter-
bury (M.L.) Trotting Club’s meeting he sent the youngster
along to the tune of 2.35, which trotting men reckon
would mean 2.30 on a larger course. Mr. Buckland has<
bought an estate at Mudgee, to which district his exten-
sive trotting establishment will probably be removed.

No greater commentary on the extraordinary
qualities of Kensington (Sydney) racecourse as a wet-
weather course could be made than that the Rosebery
Park R. Club brought off its meeting at Kensington last
Saturday. As a matter of fact, Kensington is the only
course about Sydney which can be galloped on afte r
heavy rain. When the A. J.O. started its crusade against
pony-racing, it gave out that Kensington should not be
used as a training-track by “ horse’’-trainers. One of
the biggest trainers said he would train his horses where
he pleased, more particularly as Kensington was the only
track he could get a gallop on in the wet. That trainer
handles the horses of one of the most influential men on
the A. J.C. committee—and the matter ended right there.

“S. W.”: Bulletin (3/6/’99) wonders why jockeys

Wren, the Collingwood Tote-runner, is a hard-
faced young fellow who has seemingly “ tumbled ” to the
commercial value of honesty in his much-barricaded
business. “ Wren’s prices ” have been the best of advts.
for his money-making machine, and the onetime boot-
closer in a Collingwood factory is now in a position to
plank down £lOO for the local Unemployed fund.
A particularly “clever” owner found himself
properly taken down lately. A. and B. put their heads
a _ ,“°, 1 ' ses together, and found that B.’s nag had much
tne better chance in a coming event. It was doubtful,
however, if he could beat X.’s horse. So A. and B. put
their heads together once more. As a result of their de-
liberations, A. approached X., told him his own horse
could win with X.’s out of the way, and offered the prize-
money to nothing as an inducement. Seeing a good thing
on hand, he accepted, stiffened his own and backed A.’s—
only to see B.’s win in a canter.

. The latest M. L. turf scandal concerns the run-
ning of Marina in G.N. Hurdles. A veritable moral on
paper; an odds-on favorite, and extensively backed all
ways with the books, she never raised a gallop, but simply
went to sleep on the journey. Examination by vets,
disclosed that morphia had been injected on day of race.

A Bill is being promoted in M.L. for next
session making “ ringing-in ” a criminal act of false pre-
tences, punishable by gaol only. The tainted sport of
trotting will thus be cleansed of many iniquities.

The conservatism of the average Britisher in
underestimating everything not British must have been
rampant in the handic.apper for Manchester Cup when
he allotted The Grafter 8.1 —151 b. less than Newhaven.

Black Ike Stewart added another fight to his
winning-list at Golden Gate A.C. (Sydney), Wednesday
night last, when, after a gruelling bout of 20 rounds,
witnessed by 600 sports, he got a decision over big
Geuchars. The colored man led all the way, much to the
surprise of his opponent's supporters, who came in droves
to see their man annihilate the Yankee negro. Stewart
is only a middleweight, and comparatively new at the
game, but he has done everything asked of him so far.

Boxing Crank ” ; Can see bad times ahead for
the game unless its exponents take a pull at their crooked
practices. Three successive “ schlenters,” last year, for
one championship, gave the sport a severe black ej'e.
Recently down South two champions fought a long-drawn-
out, palpably cronk go. In Sydney, during present
month, a couple of much-boomed men “ understood ” each
other but made it too glaring and profited nothing after
a ‘b Eater, in Sydney again, a “double-cross” was

“Ken ” : Aren’t some phases of the drawn-fight
business nearly played-out ? Not long ago la publican
hung up a purse and promised gate-money ; one to win.
A draw declared. Result : two good lads get £1 each,

“ Old-Timer ” : Think you’ll find Jeffries led
Fitzsimmons all the way in the recent championship
fight. Former owned too many physical advantages,
and was, at least, as clever as the lathy Austra-
lian. It must not be forgotten that Jeffries beat Peter
Jackson in three rounds —leading from the word “go,”
and Fitz. was never in it in his life with the big black, as
far as science went. The difference in years between the
pair (Jeffries is 23 and Fitz. 37) was not sufficient to
justify the application of the saw “ youth will be served.”
Fitz. had that much more experience in his favor. His
powers of endurance were as good as ever, otherwise he
could not have sustained hostilities so long in so hotly-con-
tested a fray, especially after being sent to the boards in
the second round.

With Fitzsimmons settled, Yankeedom may
reckon upon owning the world’s pug championship for
many a day to come. There’s nobody in this section
capable of successfully tackling even a'second or third-
rate Yankee heavyweight, and England has been out of
the particular article needed since Kilrain, Jackson and
Slavin, as named, accounted for that ungainly mass of
humanity, Jem Smith, and Corbett went through
“ Chorley ” Mitchell.

When the perennial Jem Mace was recently
sued, at Birmingham, for his keep at a country inn while
training for a glove-fight, the extraordinary defence was
set up that boxers of repute never paid anything in such
•cases ; but that, on the contrary, it was both an honor
and an advt. to put-up “ a gentleman of Mr. Mace’s cele-
brity.” The Judge, however, couldn’t see it; and the
guileless James had to “ part ” just like a common duke-
person.

A certain Australian Governor recently went in
for “ a bob’s worth ” of small yacht on Albert Park lagoon
(Melb.), accompanied, as crew, by a small youth of large
experience. They dropped to leeward of one of the
islands, and His Ex. proceeded to make fast the main-
sheet, preparatory to taking things easy. “Hey, boss,”
•cried the “crew,” “if you make that fast you’ll go over
when you put’er ‘ about.’” “My boy,” majestically re-
plied he of the Sunbeam, “ I sailed yachts long before you
were born.” “ Don’t matter if you sailed in th’ Hark
along o’ Noar ; if you don’t loosen that sheet you’ll cap-
size ’er —you take it from me.” Presently the boat
•cleared the lee of the island, and in two seconds a crest-
fallen Viceroy' and a soaked and indignant small boy were
wading ashore through the mud. If His Ex. hadn’t once
more fallen off he’d fallen in, in more senses than one.
Kilmamliam, winner of N.S.W. Waterloo Cup
last Saturday, is the fastest greyhound iji Australia to-
day, and, for such a big fellow, a magnifies nt worker,
the manner in which he came round at-his hare was a
levelation to local coursing-men. Nothing had a chance
with him at any time. Kilmainham is by Parnell
Kilniorna, and the present is his second season. He made
a great deb&t at Bendigo (Vic.) in all-aged stakes last
year, and, later, won the puppy stakes, giving 31 oppo-
nents no hope. May 25 last, at Moonee Valley, Kilinain-
ham and a full brother, Dandenong Ranger, divided

“ Sport ” : Coursing flourishes in Yic. and M.L.
Why not in N.S.W. ? Waterloo Cup, concluded Saturday
last, originally arranged for 63 dogs, filled up 18 short,
and, during three days of meeting, not more than 600
people, ail told, visited Rooty Hill Pluinpton. “Toe-
rag ” Ikey Mo’s were chiefly in evidence, taking the odds
to half-crowns and shillings—and sixpences at times.
Hardman, nominator of winner (Kilmainham), could get
no more than £2OO about his dog, right out ;■ he says five
times that sum would be obtainable on one course in Vic.
Writer feels satisfied the game is in wrong hands ; few of
them have standing or weight in the community. When
the proper people tackle it, and not until then, N.S.W.

The committal-for-trial of cyclist Corbett for

as a surprise to those who heard the police-court proceed-

was one for a jury—turning over to 12 inexperienced
grocers and navvies the reasoning which he admitted was

The statistics of Vic. Wheelmen’s League give
the total prize-money distributed among racing-men dur-
ing the past 12 months as £6427—0r £3B less than pre-
vious year. This goes to only 314 men, the majority of
whom got less than £5 each,'while 700 or 800 otiiers got
nothing for their trouble. Walne won most—£33l, or
£165 less than the season before—and Walker was next.

The balance-sheet of the A.N. A fete shows that
that great annual gamble only hands over; about- 20
per cent, of its receipts to the charities, in whose inte-
rests it is supposedly run. Gross takings £8784, out of
which carne £1394 for art-union prizes, £1067 for sports
and other prizes, advertising 1523, secretary and six
clerks £ c ls (of which the sec. took over £230), sundry
goods £893, catering £l9O, commission on sale of tickets
£6B. Receipts included a dishonored cheque for 11 and
bad coin to the value of 4s. Looking at it by and large,
it seems that if the art-union were abolished the Assn,
would lose little, the,charities less, and the simple public
would gain a great deal.

John Roberts failed in his libel action against
London Sportsman for having stated that the English
Billiards Championship was “in abeyance.” Roberts
argued that there had never been a real “ championship ”
match since 1870, when he won it on a new-fangled
difficult table, of which the public warmly dis-
approved. In recent years, as he admitted, he had
not been willing to play the “ all-in ” game for the
championship, because the public were tired of the
spot-stroke as a test of merit, and the “all in” game,
when tackled by the leading professors, is little else than
spot-stroking. He had stuck to the “ spot-barred ”
game, regarding Roberts as a Law unto Himself in cham-
pionship matters, which, of course, he has been these
many years, from the public point of view. However,
seeing that the Billiard Association had arranged a recent
championship which Roberts w'ouldn’t recognise the jury
found for the defendant newspaper. Heavy damages
were out of the question, anyhow. No jury would be-
lieve that Roberts’ reputation and business have suffered
through the alleged libel. Everybody knows that Daw-
son, who won the Billiard Association “championship,”
was afterwards badly beaten by Roberts in a “spot-
barred ” match.

Pity people cannot be persuaded to leave shop-
betting alone. The system in vogue at most places is
nothing more nor less than barefaced robbery. Much as
is made in other ways, the fat, smirking, heavv-paunched
proprietors of some of these “ take-downs” rake in most
of their ill-gotten gains per medium of scratchings which
they profess to record but rarely do, and then only to
whatever extent suits them. Small wonder they are
given away to the police every now and again by some
badly-used backer.

The second board appointed under Yic.
Factories Act to determine the minimum wage for
white-workers has at long last fixed the minimum
wage for such workers at 4d. per hour—not a

some parts of Australia. Also said board allows
two apprentices or improvers to every worker,
and stipulates that such must be paid 2s. 6d. a
week for the first six months, rising in five years’
time to the full rate of 16s. per week.
Jerome Cadman, Maoriland Minister of

thing he did was done well. Almost every Minis-
try has a silent cart-horse man, who stays behind
and does the work of seven, when the rest of the
Cabinet is stumping the country at a crisis.
Brunker is the N.S.W. cart-horse, but Nathaniel,

papers. Jerome Cadman can initial as many
papers as Brunker, and he knows things in addi-

Poor old Grattan Riggs was very near to
his end on April 20th when he appeared at Melb.
Alexandra as Tracey, the Detective. Of his pain-
ful display on that occasion The Bulletin said,
“ his efforts suggested footsteps on the sands ot
time when the evening sun is low.” The veteran
walked, mumbled, and forgot his lines m the first
act like one under the influence of whisky, but the
true cause of his pitiable condition was explained
by Wm. Marshall, the theatrical printer. Marshall
and his old friend had been walking on St. Kilcla
Esplanade that Saturday afternoon. Suddenly
Riggs put his hands upon Marshall’s
and reeling towards him said, “ Will, I am going.
Bearing that he would die there and then, Mar-
shall assisted the old man across the road and into
the nearest hotel, brought him round with a dose
of brandy, took him back to town on a tram-car,
and didn’t leave him until he was apparently all
right again, or as much “all right ” as he had ever
been since he began to break up. Riggs must
have suffered a partial relapse under the
strain of pulling himself together for the
evening’s performance, nevertheless he con-
trived to struggle through the first act, and as the
play went on he warmed to his work. He con-
tinued at the Alexandra for another week or two,
seeming to get stronger the while. From there
he went to Tasmania —and died. After acting for
a few nights “like a man in a dream” Riggs
closed his public career in “The Shaughraun,
ending his last performance with a pathetic appeal
to the public to “Not forget poor Conn.” Next
day he was taken to the local hospital—the com-
pany being then at Strahan —whence the worthy
old soul booked a passage to the Better Land.
Grattan Riggs narrowly escaped a fate more
dramatic than even that of Federici, who died at
Melb. Princess’s in the garb of
immediately after his descent into the mimic
Sheol. Poor Grattan might have breathed
his last in the “ wake ” scene, whilst impersonat-
ing Conn the Shaughraun’s corpse.
At Poverty Point.
Cinquevalli made his first appearance in London at the
instance of one of the Rothschilds, who had seen him on
the Continent. The late Bill Holland, then running a
big circus variety show at Covent Garden Theatre,
fetched the juggler over from St. Petersburg, and he had
only been a few days in London when “ Wales” gave him
a big advertisement by inviting him to come and talk
jugglery in the royal box, and subsequently engaging
him for a private performance at Marlborough House.
Cinquevalli speaks of Albert Edward as his most friendly
and easy-mannered patron among the purple crowd,
second only to King Humbert, who has several times been
round to his dressing-room for a yarn about the cannon-
ball and things in general.
The other night, after the performance of “ The Sign of
the Cross,” a beautiful wreath of laurel, tied with rib-
bons, was handed up to Julius Knight. The curtain de-
scended, to rise unexpectedly and discover to the eyes of
the multitude the actor gazing tenderly at the tiny note
attached. The sender is wishing she hadn’t.
“Melb.” : What strange anomalies one sees nowadays.
At a recent Wesley Church Pleasant Afternoon a fair
Jewess mounted the pulpit, and sang “ Glorified Re-
deemer,” with such pathos as to melt the soul of every
Wesleyan. She was recalled from the vestry where she
had retired, scaled the pulpit again, and bowed her
thanks. The piano-accompanist was a handsome
man with a fine flowing nose—referring only to its con-
tour. He is to act Mephistopheles in the forthcoming
amateur “ Faust,” at the Princess’s.
“ Melb.” : Wybert Reeve allured me to the Unitarian
Church, the other Sunday night, for his lecture on Shake-
speare. I thought he could shake off the Crummies, but
he couldn’t. The old school was over it all, and, though
it was only preaching from the pulpit, even the stage
strut and stagger seemed to be miraculously included.
Let me hasten to add that the matter was good, and
justified the irrepressible applause of the crowded con-
gregation, the agonised churchwardens calling “Sh !
Sh 1 ” But Wybert’s “Tobe or not to be ” was atrocious.
Instead of Hamlet musing and communing with his soul,
he was scoring under every alternate word, for the benefit
of the pit. Whatever was forced and unnatural in the pro-
nunciation of the Grand Old School was brought into the
limelight by Wybert. Why doesn’t he remember how
well he enacted the Crushed Tragedian ?
Lalla Miranda is now singing at Brussels Opera, the
place where artists are recruited for Paris and London.
If the graceful Lalla can make a sensation, now is her
time to get the chance.
Melbourne had never seen the true Serpentine dance
effects until Mdlle. Edmunda fluttered her draperies in
Dante’s show. Dante of yore was touring ’Murka with
Loie Fuller, the authoress of the Serpentine, and his pre-
sent stage-manager, who was also in the co., has the
proper recipe for working the limelight on the drapery.
There seems to be a secret in the lighting, which, so far,
none of the Australian managers have managed to get
hold of. Dante’s lady sometimes melts, as it were, into
a reflection of the picture in the lantern-slide.
“H.”: Coppin has stirred up various reminiscents on
the glories of the Melb. stage. Let me stick in dates :
1840, first theatre, Royal Pavilion, Bourke-street, near
Bull and Mouth ; 1842, Queen’s Theatre opened, J. T.
Smith, owner; 1844, Coppin’s co., from Launceston, in-
cluding Rogers, Young, and Mrs. Young; 1845, Mrs.
Coppin the leading actress; 1850, leading Australian
tragedians, Nesbitt, King, ShearcrOft; 1855, most event-
ful year in Melt), dramatic history—Brooke’s d6but at
Queen’s, opening of Theatre Royal, opening of Coppin’s
Olympic, also of Astley’s (afterwards Princess’s); 1856,
Coppin in management of the Royal ; 1858, Ellen Mortyn,
the Gongenheims, Mary Provost ; 1860, Brooke’s farewell;
1862, Barry Sullivan’s d6but ; 1863, Jefferson’s debut,
Barry Sullivan’s management, Coppin opens Haymarket;
1864, the Keans, Dillon ; 1867, Montgomery, Anderson,
Celeste; 1870, Mathews. A long gap after this before
any other performer of first-rate distinction came.
Like Cissv Loftus, Carrie Hoore went direct from
cloister to stage. She was educated at Geelong Convent
—the institution which produced Myra Kemble.
A galvanic ’Murkan struck Hobart t’other day with a
mesmeric show. For six consecutive nights the local
Royal resounded to the plaudits and laughter of a tumul-
tuous audience of about 50, including deadheads, while
the Prof, toyed airily with cataleptics and hypnotism, and
sent a subject to ‘sleep for four days, and invited local
doctors to come along and stick pins into the soft parts
of the patient whenever they felt so disposed. At the
end of the week the season suddenly went the way of all
fl PS h—which is grass. The large-heart* d local amateurs
organised a benefit to the Prof. The Hobart public re-
gards mesmerism pretty much as last century Britishers
regarded a witch. Besides, a showman who professes to
send people to sleep is bound to be taken as more or less
of an insult to the national honor of Tasmania.
“ Gumsucker ” : The only modern counterpart of the
sack of Rome bv the Goths is the attack made by Harry
P. Coghill in Perth on “In Town,” a burlesque sacred to
the memory of Bradfield, Grace Palotta, Maud Hobson,
and Rossel. Harry P. Coghill, the fat singer of raucous
songs, essays in vain the delicate work that burlesque
demands. The awful absurdity of Harry P. as Coddington
was almost equalled by the effrontery of the new Duke of
Muffshire, and the new comic parson, and the new ballet,
and the new stage-mounting. The boy who played
Shrimp alone provided a redeeming feature.
“Rottnest”: Perth cannot support a good theatrical
co.,but exploitation by a one-man show ought to pay.
The mistake must not lie made of coming here without an
Eastern reputation. VVe all look East. Melb. and Sydney
are our Mecca and Jerusalem. London may form your
notions, oh Easterners-but you form ours. Friedenthal
was here, but we had never heard of him—so he passed
on disappointed. Dante ought to come to us and
Cinquevalli. We know all about them now*
Rev. Father Robinson, the adviser of Amy Castles, is
the boss showman of the Vic. R.C. Church. For the last
year or two he has been lecturing with limelight-views
around the country.
One great help to the Amy Castles boom was that every
concert was announced from the altar in the chief Melb.
R.C. churches and the congregation urged to go.
Poor Harry Hod son, actor, stage-manager, &c., who
once played an ideal Sir Andrew Aguecheek with the
Jennings crowd, to say nothing of his Casoa and his Poly-
dore in “ Ingomar the Barbarian,” has a victim to
the fatal banana-peel at last, and lies in Ipswich Hospital
(Q.) with a compound fracture of the leer.
“ Haresfoot” : Riggs was a good actor—what the pro*
fession willingly recognises in its word artist. I "* v ®
written before on the best Irish comedians not being
Irish, without suspecting that Riggs never sniffed Erin.
His acting was transparently natural. As Hazlitt said cl
Bannister— “He put on the character as a surtout over
himself, warm and comfortable.”
Recently-deceased scenic-artist Gordon was a man of
such keen sensibilities that he forewent the study of
anatomy on account of his horror of the dissecting-room.
Not a few, like Gordon, have fainted on first introduction
to such a place, but they have mostly returned to the
charge—which Gordon could never be induced to do.
Mr. Robert Kennedy, the well-known vocalist, has re-
solved to give up wandering and settle down in Mel-
bourne as a teacher of singing and voice-production. He
can be heard of at 18 Rowena Parade, Richmond, Vic-
toria.
“P.A.” :Re “ E.’s ” blame of stage-manager for Miss
Hepner’s lugubrious unlikeness to an Army lass. Miss
H. is a “ star,” and the stage-manager has no more to do
with choosing a star’s expression than he has with. order-
ing her breakfast. As to the alleged non-necessity for
representing a character to the life, that is the “ snide
actor’s view. With the true actor the only departures
from nature excusable are what are necessary by exag-
geration to show those workings of the mind which an
audience would otherwise miss. “Gully-jumpers’ do
things another way, but this isn’t their funeral.
Percy Abbott, Heller’s agent, writes to say he isn’t
dead: “Meeting a Hay resident in Sydney, recently, I
was pained to hear that a report of my death had gamed
credence amongst my former townsmen. The report did
not explain whether I had been killed in battle at Doorn-
kop or had died of old age and croup at Kiama. I may
say at once that my reported death in Kiama is false. No
orie dies in Kiama ; they just fossilise and dry up ; and
my demise in Africa is much exaggerated. True, I was
at Kimberley when a Sergt.-major Abbott, m Dr. Jim s
idiotic foray,' had the top of his head blown off while reck-
lessly charging the Boers. This alone should have proved
it was the wrong Abbott, for my friends all know that,
when in business at Hay, my charges were very moderate
—nothing to get one’s hair off about, let alone the top of
his head. While the other Abbott was getting himself
killed in a way that would never occur to me, I was in a
hotel arguing the point with some friendly Boers. We
nearly came to blows, but hostilities were averted just as
I got my coat off, by the Boers ordering in more wine.
I want you to make public this matter of my being still
alive, as I do not want, the feelings of people who owe me
money to be trifled with.”
“ Cockaigne” : Irving’s disasters have been capped by
the burning of almost every scrap of valuable scenery he
possesses. The god Thespis, if there be such, seems to
say to him “ Get 1” The mountings of 30 of his plays, all
the finest efforts of Hawes Craven, have gone. Somebody
suggests, however, that the catastrophe may prove as
beneficial as the loss of a parson’s sermon-tub in the
Atlantic, with all the discourses of thirty years which he
was going to preach again in a new continent. But, as a
London paper cruelly said of G. V. Brooke, “life has no
second spring.” Unless his long-despised Pinero or Jones
can fit him, Irving is gone.
Little Stella Ranger, the 13-year-old warbler at
Rickards’s, ought to develope into another Maggie Moore
by-and-bye, if her health is not sacrificed to salary con-
siderations whilst she is growing up. Stella has plenty of
intelligence and lots of “ go.” And her voice is clear,
penetrating and easily pathetic—just such another voice
as Maggie Moore’s must have been at the same age.
Cinquevalli’s assistant (who introduces low-comedy into
the “ turn ” wherever the boss gives him the necessary
points to work on) is not the man whom new-chums have
seen in London, although he looks like the same over-
grown page, thev say. This assistant was brought out to
Australia by Cinquevalli, but his first appearance in pub-
lic was at Melb. Bijou.
Bert Gilbert has gone on the variety stage in England.
His biggest success, according to the Era, is as the
drunken uncle in the brown overcoat who has an alterca-
tion with an invisible cabman, and suppresses him by his
indignant howl of—“ How dare you, you blackguard !
Which item —even down to the brown overcoat —is lifted
bodily out of Williamson’s panto., “Babesin the Woods.’
Wybert Reeve, in his lecture on Shakespeare, could not
help telling the public that he and Wilkie Collins wrote
the dramatic versions of the “ Woman in White” and
“ No Name.”
“ Shifter” : Few performers can gulp down a morsel on
the stage. Walter Montgomery, in the breakfast-scene
of “ Still Waters Run Deep,” ate two eggs and a round of
toast, and drank two cups of coffee.
“CC ” : Been having a sort of farewell look at ever-
successful “ East Lynne ” on Sydney Royal Standard
stage, with its big-print moral to the married woman to
be more judicious in her manner of going astray. Nowa-
days every manager makes his own version of “East
Lynne”; there is no recognised or authorised version ;
and there are more versions than there are hairs on the
bald sea-shore. The Standard one kept Afy Hallijohn in
the greenroom all night; you heard of Af.v’s friskiness and
crinoline and saw neither. This was a circumstance not to
be atoned for by the fact that two of the other ladies
wore blouses that came into fashion this year, Miss Corry
alone gambolling in the floppy garments of the middle-
century. Various mysteries re time and place required
clearing up, as when, during Carlyle's honeymoon,
Richard Hare asked Sister Barbara for ft 00, and in the
process of groing* across the road to ask for it Mr. Carlyle
had two children born, and Lady Isabel drifted on
to the eve of her elopement. Re the dying child
with the hard, healthy voice, at “East Lynne’
it is customary for the child to die in the middle
of the floor opposite a passage with no door to it, so that
everyone can look in and see the performance. Lady
Isabel also goes to heaven by the same draughty death.
In both cases it is evident that the cold wind from that
passage has been blowing on the invalid all through a
lingering illness.
“Pippo ” : Life in the old dog yet. Veteran violinist
Foveaux (aged 80) advertised a few months ago in the
Argus for an accompanist. “He wanted to work up
some solos for concert work.”
The Republic and the Atacama.
When the unsea worthy ship Atacama was sent to
sea from a N.S.W. port, and foundered with
the loss of thirteen lives—being neither the first
nor the twentieth vessel from that port so to dis-
appear under similar circumstances—the N.S.W.
Marine Board defended itself, among other
grounds, on the ground that it had no jurisdic-
tion to prevent unseaworthy ships leaving these
shores unless they carried passengers. That
excuse, devised to shield the Board’s notorious
incompetence, has now been definitely exploded-
after the Atacama trial, after Premier Reid’s
expression of his intention to abolish the
Marine Board, after two plebeian members had
been added to insult the Board’s aristocratic privi-
leges, and after Premier Reid had taken special
steps in the case of the ship Republic. The Re-
public is an elderly American vessel of 1287 tons,
which was sold cheap in Sydney to proceed to the
Gilbert Islands for use as a hulk. Twice she
was permitted to set out on her voyage, and
twice she returned on the representations of the
crew that she was in a more or less leaky condi-
tion. On the third occasion there was something
very like a mutiny when the sailors were ordered to
heave anchor, and one of them was recalled to duty
with a revolver-bullet. On the third occasion—and
in response to the repeated stimuli recounted —the
Marine Board woke right up; and refused to
permit the Republic to go to sea until she had
been docked for examination. And, in spite of
the Marine Board’s previous contention that it
had no power to detain vessels under such circum-
stances, the owners of the Republic found she
could not leave port without a clearance ; and ap-
pealed to the Governor-in-Council to upset the
Marine Board’s decision. This the Council
has refused to do; and the legal authority
which the Marine Board declared to be
non-existent has been triumphantly vindicated.
The Marine Board, in fact, has now done in the
case of the Republic precisely what it should have
done in the case of the Atacama. The Bulletin
presumes that the only absolute proof of a vessel’s
unseaworthiness is given when she founders ; but
in the cases of the Atacama and the Republic there
existed and exists a grave doubt as to the
vessel’s seaworthiness, which should have been,
and should be as far as possible, settled. The
Atacama should have been stripped and her
bottom overhauled —precisely as the Marine
Board now considers necessary in the case of
the Republic. But when the Atacama sailed the
Board was fast asleep and snoring. It is now as
much awake as such a somnolent institution can
possibly be ; and the owners of the Republic are
suffering. The decision which keeps their ship in
port was in effect given, not by the eight members
of the Marine Board, but by the thirteen drowned
Atacama sailors.
At one of George Reid’s meetings, a
dealer in cement made himself very obstructive,
but was flattened-out when somebody hit George
on the waistcoat with a flour-bag. “ That doesn’t
matter,” blandly observed Reid ; “it’s like Mr.
Blowhard’s cement—-it won’t stick !”
At 2 o’clock on Referendum Day, four
hours before the polls closed and 4\ hours before
any possible returns could come in, Sydney Tele-
graph put up on its notice-board the report of
two imaginary votes on the “No” side, just to
set the ball rolling. Which was beautifully ap-
propriate in its way. Evidently Ananias and
Sapphira had voted the anti-Eederal ticket early.
The argument that Yic. Opposition will
use, when Parliament assembles, against the
Madden-Syme Commission is that Judge Wil-
liams is notoriously a personal friend of Syme’s,
and, equally notoriously, no friend of the Madden
clan. This point the Argus, in befriending Mad-
den, has studiously refrained from alluding to, but
it is the very one about which politicians talk
most. Turner asked the Judges to select a Com-
missioner, and they chose their senior member,
Williams. But Williams, it is alleged, strongly
leant to Syme during the last Speight and Syme
action ; and his appointment in the feud with
Madden is strongly criticised.
There’s never been a big drink in Melb.
to beat the housewarming at Sargood, Butler and
Co. new warehouse. When the Naicest lot had
done their speeches and cleared out, after wolfing
everything they could put away in an hour, the
invited guests took a turn, and then a few of the
uninvited crept in, and were made so welcome
with free drinks and tobacco that all over the
town spread the joyous news that S., B. and Co.
were keeping open house in Flinders-street with a
bar on every floor. Then the rush set in, and, at
closing-up time, the chuckers-out had a hard job
to extract the giddy revellers from every hole and
corner of those premises, and pile them in heaps
in the yard, until they could be upended and
sorted-out for despatch to their homes ; and
morning had broken before the last job-lot was in-
voiced-out. The “ whole-hog’’-ness of the affair
may be estimated from the facts that 100 cases of
champagne were consumed, and that it took
the firm’s staff nearly all next day to count the
bottles.
E. J. Brady’s book of ballads and verses,
mostly from The Bulletin, is now ready; and

How Melb. groans for anything even
dimly resembling a rational and healthy means of
spending its Sunday and forgetting the ton-load of
Scotchbyterianism on its soul! The other Sunday
the Wesleyans held their semi-religious “ pleasant
afternoons ” both at Port Melb. and in the city.
Both crowded. Rabbi Abrahams also lectured
in the large Prahran Town Hall, with vocal
and instrumental music. To start at 3. by 2.30
standing room was unobtainable, and hundreds
were disappointed. And the dour and gloomy
kirk, where the parson croaks about the old dry
doctrine, stands empty.
After the Perthshire (now happily safe in
port per the good offices of the Union Co.’s
Talune) had been tossing about for 50 days it
struck someone to send a man-o’-war after her.
The Admiral was away, so was Premier Reid, so
were the war-ships. However, the Admiral was
reached by wire, and it was decided to send the
Mildurafrom Pt. Chalmers, M.L. All the resources
of red-tape were called in as usual when time is
everything. The Admiral applied to the Gover-
nor for the vessel’s latest position. His Ex.
appealed to the Premier. Premier, away elec-
tioneering, applied to the Chief Secretary, who
went to the Works Minister. Potato Young got
a Herald and told Lord Beauchamp, who could
easily have read the papers himself, and no doubt
had done so. Meanwhile another week was lost
and by then the Perthshire had been picked up.
Last week the startled Sydneyite gaped in
mingled wonder and terror at an “ open letter ”
heaved at John Norton by one Gilbert Probyn
Smith, and sold in pamphlet form for 6d. per
copy. This screed charged the vitriolic Jacko
with pretty nearly every crime and monkey-trick
in the calendar, and wound up with an enthusi-
astic promise of a “second edition.” When the
Sydneyite had recovered from his faint he went
off to effect a general insurance on his life and
property, for it was expected that the sirocco of
withering curses that Jacko would fire off in
Sunday’s Truth would blast the city off the
shores of the beautiful harbor and utterly wreck
the resources of this great country. But Truth’s
only reference was a solitary small whisper from a
correspondent, signed with a solitary “F.,” to the
effect that John Norton was a bit of a devil out-
side but a very white man inside. John is respon-
sible for a lot of disappointment in Sydney last
Sunday. He is away electioneering, and promises
to prosecute Smith criminally on his return to
Sydney.

Set ’em up with prayers devout;
Let your faith he simple-hearted,
Never entertain a doubt.

Sing them in sepulchral tones ;
If they lived as in the story,
Bet your life they’ve gone to Glory.

Good old bones, so dry and dusty,
Rattle in your cases neat;
Though the Faith be old, ’tis lusty,
Strong upon its ancient feet.

For a certain means of saving
Souls that find relief in groans;
Hallowed by the pious Tory
Now, as in the ages hoary—

A Great Cure at the Ivanhoe

Mr. 0. J. A. NIELSEtf,
A Living Witness oi the virtues of the
Aifaline Herbal Remedies.
Kalgoorlie, September 12, 1898.
To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir.—l feel it my duty to write and tell you how
your remedies have cured me.
I suffered great agony with WEAK NERVES and
RHEUMATICS, and I sent for some of your ALFALINE
REMEDIES, which completely cured me, and I have felt
as well as I could wish, although it is two years ago.
I also tried your ALFALINE UNIVERSAL PILLS,
which completely cleared my skin and purified my blood,
and I am now using your ALFALINE HAIR RESTORER,
which has thoroughly cleaned the scalp and made the
hair grow again, and it has gradually turned the hair
from being grey to that of its original color. I have also
recommended your Remedies for a number of different
complaints and I have never known them to fail, but to
do all that was claimed for them. I have great pleasure
to recommend these remedies to all sufferers, as I know
they can be depended on.
You are at liberty to publish this as well as my photo.
Yours truly, C. J. A. NIELSEN.
Sciatica Cured.
Parliament House, Sydney.
To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir.—l can truthfully assert that since using your
Eucalyptus Oil and Alfaline Rheumatic Pills I have ex-
perienced an immunity from mv attack of sciatic. I have
recommended the Alfaline Remedies to a number of my
constituents, and I will do the same to all whom I hear
complaining of rheumatic attacks. With kind regards,
I have the honor to be, yours truly,
E. W. O’SULLIVAN, M.L.A.
Nerves, Liver, and Kidneys Cured.
175 Young-street, Annandale, Sydney.
To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir,— Having suffered for some time from a com
plaint of the liver and kidneys, for which I took medical
advice, with no effect, I one day was fortunate enough to
pick up one of your books in the bush. I was thus in-
duced to try your Alfaline Remedies, and their effect was
magical. I have often since recommended them to my
neighbors, all of whom have felt the benefit as well as
myself. I cannot express how glad lamat my recovery,
as several doctors had given me up, as my husband can
testify.—Yours truly, (Signed) Mrs. H. SMITH.

Blood Disease Cured.
Sth. Murwillutnbah, Jan. 4, ’99.
Herr Rassmussen, Sydney.—Dear Sir,—Having just
finished the course of Alfaline Blood Pills and Alfaline
Liver and Kidney Pills, I have pleasure in stating that
they have effected a complete and permanent cure, al-

“Sheoak,” re N.S.W. illicit whisky-stills:—
I am confident that in many cases local police are in the
swnn. In Picton, Bowral, Berrima, Mittagonjr, and
Worn burn districts ; in Jamberoo, Wollongong, Grafton
and Tweed river districts, private stills are numerous!
and daily turn out gallons of illicit spirit—some good
some indifferent, some vile and murder-provoking-; and
this, too, underthe very noses of thepolice, and presumedly
with the full knowledge and consent of some of them. In
the early seventies, when certain mines were “ booming ”
and even black sand was being, greedily bought up by
“expert” agents of big Sydney firms at £98 per tori,
certain officers, did a roaring trade with the 700 Chinese
then on the-mines. They issifed fan-tan “gambling-
licenses,” “ girl-licenses,” &c., and thus made far more
money than they received as salary. When some simple
Chow got but one day in arrears with his “ gambling ” or
“ girl license,” the cops, raided the fan-tan shops by
night indiscriminately, and marched, perhaps, a dozen
“ monkeys” to the local lock-up. Early next day one of
the couple, wearing big, blue Spectacles and a red silk
smoking-cap, took his seat in a chair placed upon a table
with a drawn sword in each hand and all the available
hand-cuffs in stock dangling round his neck, and called
out in a loud voice to -the affrighted, opium - sick
Chinese to plead. They would plead and be fined,
and £10, £20, and £30 were often scooped in by these
“traps” before breakfast. After this, a fortnight’s drunken
orgy, and then more drawn swords and more money.
To-day the N..S.W. police play different cards, but scoop
in, probably, just as much coin. About theTweed river I
know of four private stills ; c- rtain local policemen know
them, too, and probably three- times as many. Every-
man down there keeps cows, as they pay best ; and the
Tweed river cow, though up to her belly in clover, seems
always to want plenty of molasSes, and she always seems
to get plen ty. Hogshead after hogshead of this stuff is
weekly arriving at the dairyman’s house ; but the cow,
for which it is ordered, gets none of it. It is converted in-
to whisky, brandy, or rum, and sold to local innkeepers.
Any smart detective able to milk cows could, at Tweed
river, in one month unearth—some of the milkmen’s
stills are down in cellars under the kitchen chimneys—
at least a dozen illicit distilling'plants, and also prove, up
to the hilt, that most of the publicans in the district are
in the conspiracy; that police are also in it; and that
six cows, feeding daily on the best and richest of in-
digenous and imported grasses, can’t and don’t eat two
hogsheads of vile molasses every week; and that they
wouldn’t get it from their owners even if they could. It
wouldn’t pay, even at the cheap price ruling.
Capt. Russell, beseeching Maoriland to make
him Premier at the coming election in place of
Digger Dick, promises to keep in force all the
Socialistic legislation which he has always de-
nounced, and “loyally administer” it, and not
repeal it till it has had a “ fair trial,” and has
proved a failure. Good old Russell says, in
effect :—“ I always opposed these laws and de-
clared they meant ruin and failure. Bub if you
put me in power I will loyally administer them
(/ will be sole judge of what is loyal adminis-
tration), and give them a fair trial (I will de-
cide what is a fair trial), and won’t repeal
them till I have proved them a failure (I will
define what is failure). I will do my best to
prove that I was a short-sighted ass when I
denounced these laws, and I won’t manage it;
and then I will reluctantly and sorrowfully
admit that in opposing these laws I was the
one brainy statesman in this country, and we
will go back to the good old Tory rut of our
forefathers.
On the foundling-hospital question :—
Dear Bulletin. — At a recent Melbourne meeting to
consider the proposal to establish a foundling hospital,
one zealous lady vaguely suggested that the fathers of
children accommodated in such should be made to pay
for their keep. The present Infant Life Protection Act,
however, gets a tolerably secure grip in this respect on
the fathers of illegitimates, and, once in possession of the
maintenance-order thereunder made, the contraband
mamma generally hands the infant over to the baby-
farming-ghoul, with result that, the unfortunate bantling
is more or less speedily eliminated. The State, it may be
mentioned, is supposed to supervise these establishments
through the medium of police-sergeants and senior-consta-
bles, and the sight of a 6ft. “copper” solemnly turning over
an 18in. infant to see if it has the regulation underwear,
and is “ properly nourished,” is a truly edifying spectacle
which may be witnessed any day in’ the more smellful
Melbourne suburbs. These advertising nurses are often
most ignorant persons, who take in mangling and beer,
and who even go so far as appropriately to announce that
families are “ done for” within. Again, where a number
of infants are herded on one “farm,” there is imminent
danger, from the fact that many of the poor little
creatures are born with the ghastliest of contagious
diseases. Taken altogether, the present barbarous
state of things absolutely howls for something in the way
of the proposed hospital. In such an institution the
diseased and the healthy infants could at least be sepa-
rated, and many of the ill-starred waifs would be set
upon sturdy legs before being sent forth to the fray of
life. —R.G.M.
Domestic servants who contract illness are re-
gularly despatched by wealthy employers of
Sydney to one or other of the local public
hospitals, to be there treated at general ex-
pense. The defence of this is that these em-
ployers subscribe a couple of guineas or so each
per year, and are thereby entitled to nominate
to a bed or two. But such subscribers figure
on the printed lists as public benefactors, not
as policy-holders for the cheap doctoring of the
menials of their households. In the rude early
days, masters were allowed to send sick assigned
servants to the Govt, hospitals but were bound
to victual them in the institution for fourteen
days. Now, the master who contributes from
one to five guineas obtains the kudos of a bene-
factor, and, as has happened lately, may keep
two beds occupied for several months by his
own domestics.

Brisbane Courier, on the paucity of Austra-
lian candidates willing to enter the kingdom of
parsondom
We do not want a pampered ministry ; that were worse
than useless. But the Churches will be helpless till they
offer a support which is not conspicuously and hopelessly
below what may be reached along other professions which
demand no longer or more costly preparation.
Is it a fact, then (as the Courier implies), that
men entering the ministry actually judge of
the fitness of the vocation by its financial stand-
ing as compared with other professions ? Most
folks were under the impression that the taking
of the clergyman’s office was the result of a man’s
feeling “a sacred call ” within him to preach
the Gospel, and old-time parsons always spoke
of it as such. And now , it seems (as the godly
Courier confesses), it’s all a matter of screw
and filthy lucre. . . . Fancy St. Paul taking
to the Apostle business because it paid better j
than tent - making, public - house keeping, or
lawyerising !
There is an outcry in Vie. Civil Service
against the hard-and-fast rule of promotion by
seniority. In Vie. Service age qualifies and dis-
qualifies. Up to 60, officers are promoted for
>being old ; after 60, they are fired out for the same
reason. Meanwhile preferment only comes to him
who waits. In fact, the race for promotion is a
wait-for-age event.

Baron Berzelius’ Report.
These Bitters X recommend in DYSPEPSIA, CHRONIC RHEUMATISM and CUTA-
NEOUS AFFECTIONS. The action of Buchu on the human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of the Kidney and Bladder than any other herbal plant; and it also assists persons suffer-
ing from Skin Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and inducing perspiration.
Read What Medical Men Say About Them,
BJERKIN, M.D. The Bitter is pure, and not like others in overdoses. It has a remark-
able influence on the Liver, promoting the secretions of Bile, and correcting it when deranged,
and restores healthy evacuations in cases of habitual costiveness.
D. ECKSTROM, M.D. -BBBB—I find these Bitters a most valuable and wholesome
Tonic,'being pure and’strengthening; a stimulant to the Liver, assisting Digestion. I therefore
thus recommend them. '
G. B. WOOD, M.D. It is the purest of Bitters, and exerts a peculiar influence over the
Liver.

The Stick and the Crust.
A STICK and a crust of bread. Like the hands of
a clock these two articles told the time o’ day for
nearly a year in a certain man’s life. Yet, unlike
the hands of a clock, they were not visible at once.
When he needed the stick he had no use for the,
crust ; and when the crust was welcome he had no
further occasion for the stick.
Albeit he was a young fellow of twenty-six, you
would be wrong in supposing this stick to have
been in the nature of a weapon for attack or de-
fence. In that case the crust and the stick would
have harmonised. As it was, they did not. For
the stick was a support, not a club.
Now, when a man feels the pressure of eighty or
ninety years, he is apt to want a travelling com-
panion of that sort ; but one in the very heyday of
youth, not suffering from any injury and not con-
stitutionally feeble, or malformed, should com-
monly be able to walk without a stick. And so
this young man had always done up to the time
when he fell out with the crust and with all that
the crust stood for or represented.
His own account of the circumstances runs
thus: —“Up to Ootober, 1893, I had been a
strong, healthy, and active man. Then I com-
menced to feel weak and out of sorts. I was
heavy, tired, and had no ambition or energy.
What had come over me I could not imagine. I
had a foul, nasty taste in the mouth, and was
constantly spitting up a thick, dirty phlegm. My
appetite left me, and what little I ate lay on my
stomach like lead, causing me great pain about
the chest. A short, distressing cough settled
upon me and troubled me day and night.
“ At night my sleep was disturbed and broken
with night sweats and frightful dreams. I had
great pain at the left side around the heart, and
my breathing was hurried and short. Next I
began to spit blood, and was greatly alarmed at
it. I wasted away rapidly, losing over a stone
weight in a month, and became so weak that I
was unable to rise on my feet without assistance.
“Although only a young man of twenty-six, I
was obliged to hobble about with a stick, and could
walk but a short distance even at that. Worried
and anxious, I attended the York County Hospital,
where the doctors sounded me, and said I was in
a consumption.”
Here we have another of the serious and often
fatal mistakes that are made in cases like this.
Misled by symptoms which in some respects re-
semble those of consumption, medical men hastily
decide that the lungs are affected, treat the patient
perfunctorily for the hopeless disease he is not
afflicted with, and leave the result to chance.
Hence he often dies of dyspepsia and its complica-
tions-his true disease—which, unlike consump-
tion, is easily curable by the remedy our friend
finally employed.
“ They gave me cod-liver oil,” he continued,
“ and medicines, but I got no better. Indeed, I
was so low-spirited and miserable I didn’t care
what became' of me. As time passed, I grew
weaker and weaker.
“ After I had endured ten months of this, Mr.
R. W. Dickinson, the chemist in Walmgate, ad-
vised me to try Mother Seigel’s Syrup. After
taking it a few days I felt much better, my appe-
tite reviving and my food giving me no pain. I
continued to take this medicine only, and soon
the cough and breathing trouble left me and I
began to gain strength and flesh. When I had
taken three bottles I was as strong as ever, and
could eat and enjoy'even a dry crust. I have
since had good health. You are liberty to publish
this letter and refer all inquirers to me. (Signed)
Isaiah Lewis, 124 Walmgate, York, April Bth,
1894.”
If the reader wonders how a man could suffer
so much, become so emaciated and weak, and be
pushed so near the grave’s edge through what is
sometimes flippantly called “ mere indigestion,”
he has yet to learn that the digestion is the arbiter
of life and death. The “ crust ” (food), enjoyed
and digested, means life and strength. Rejected
it means the “stick,” to supplement swift-coming
weakness ; and then the prone position, when help
is vain. Mother Seigel’s Syrup enabled Mr. Lewis
to substitute the crust for the stick. It cured his
dyspepsia.*

“ BOTH WENT WRONG.”
w l was in Utter Despair.”
A CHANGE OVER THE SCENE.
“It must be Clements Tonic.”
(8™ “Miotoion Independent " June 18,1898.)
(by our special reporter.)
Mp. I. Perlman is a clothier, and resides
and carries on business at No. 34 Sussex-
etreet, Sydney. He is now in excellent
health, but he informed the reporter that a
tew months ago he was in a terrible plight.
“My Kidneys and Liver
both went wrong,” explained Mr. Perlman
to the reporter, “ and none of the doctors
could do anything for me. If I had but
known, said Mr. Perlman, somewhat
regretfully, “of the virtues of Clements
ionic when I first fell sick, I could have
saved
All the Doctor’s Bills.”
Will you kindly state the beginning of
the trouble and its progress?” asked the
reporter.
“I will with pleasure. I noticed my
appetite became very touchy. I should
suddenly get quite hungry, and then, after
eating a few mouthfuls, I took quite a
Disgust to my food.
Wind frequently troubled me after meals,
bringing on belching, and I could taste my
food for hours after eating a meal. In the
mornings I woke with a dull headache and
a most unpleasant, bitter taste in my
mouth, which was
Dry and parched.
Then pain began to trouble me at the pit of
the stomach, as well as between the
shoulders and across the loins. As time
went on these pains became more intense.
I had no inclination to eat anything, and
Would turn away with a
Feeling of Sickness
from the most tempting dishes. For nours
I lay awake at nights, rolling from side to
side, trying to snatch a few minutes’rest;
but the dull pain in the back never left me,
and sound sleep was out of the question. I
wa» eace a great smoker, but now I could
not enjoy a cigar as I used to, and when I
tried one, I had to throw it away almost as
soon as lighted. I managed to get out of
bed once a day, just as a matter of form, for
** hen I was up I was not able to do any-
Wiug, and was
‘Compelled to Lie Down
mist of the time. I always felt dull,
weary and depressed, and my head felt as
heavy as a weight. I could not hold it up,
but had to rest it on the back of a chair.
My eyes ached continually, and to save
them a little I used to turn my face away
irom the light. There I would lie with
half-shut eyes, almost
Unable to Move,
and getting thinner and thinner and weaker
and more yellow every day. My kidney
symptoms, about which I won’t go into
minute particulars,
Wei-e Very Distressing.
There was a dragging feeling across the
loins as though a heavy weight was there,
ana sometimes a sensation as though some-
thing alive was gnawing at me. Then a
sharp, twinging pain would strike me further
up the back, which was so piercing that it
would cause me suddenly to sit bolt upright
and r e
Scream out with Agony.
I could do no work. My wife had to attend
to the shop, and go out and do all my
business transactions. The doctors told me
(and I went to several) that both my kidneys
and liver were affected, but that they would
probably get right id time if I followed
their directions and took their medicines I
was a good patient. I did exactly as I was
told, but I was greatly disappointed, for I
can assure you that not one of their pro*
scnp uons did me the least good or gave me
One Hour’s Relief
from the terrible pain which I suffered,
lime rolled on and I continued to get worse,
and I took to my bed as I thought for good.
L had other doctors but they could do
nothing. I had frequently heard favourably
of Clements Tonic, and as a sort of last
resort I tried it. At this time
I was in Utter Despair
for I thought my time had come, and that
nothing could cure me, though, perhaps, I
might obtain a little temporary relief. Well,
I took a few doses. Next day my wife said,
You look 8* bit better, do you feel any
change ? I answered ‘ Yes, Ido certainly feel
as though there was a change; it must be
Clements Tonic,
I must Continue It.
I did, and was delighted to find that' I
seemed to improve with every dose. For
the first time for months I could fancy
something to eat. I asked my wife to cook
me something. My wife said that what I
wanted was against the doctor’s orders, but
I insisted and ate a fair meal. It didn’t do
me any harm either, for I had a
Long, Refreshing Sleep
after it. No more doctor’sphysic, I said to
myself, Clements Tonic and good nourishing
food is what I want. From that time 1 felt
my recovery was assured. Clements Tonic
Restored My Wasted Energies
at a rapid rate; it kept up a splendid
appetite, and my system became so
ened that even my hair, which had got very
thin during my illness, grew thickly again.
My appetite remained excellent, and I put
on flesh very quickly. I slept well, and the
pains in my back gradually and
Entirely Went Away.
In time I was able to attend to my business
again, and I was soon cured, and have been
since, and am now as well as ever in
my life. ”■

or kidneys since that time ? ”

“ Do you object to this testimonial being
published?”
“No, certainly not. For the benefit of
other sufferers publish it whenever, where-
ever, and in whatever maimer you may
deem fit.”

The Dead Ships.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Sound, sleeping sound, with thejr sere sails rotting
. j round, . .. . • 6 !l ' v
On their bleached beds down below,
■By a viscid seaweed slimed ; by a hoar ooze, whitely
rimed, A} . { -.bib ,
Lie low, the drown’d dead ships lie lo^v,.
All dreaming: of the, dockyards,
All longing for the quays ;, , . .
Where the living ships yet come and
Still waiting for the south wind, f" 1
Still watching for the tides, jt
And the cheery sailor lads’ ye-ho. ;
Beep, crowded deep, where the clammy sea-slugs
creep, . . -
And the polyp builds and bores,
Turn the traders in : their grief, groans the gunship
on the reef. . t x
Roll the frigates on the floors.
Oh, the gunship.hears the stroke
Of the round-shot thro’ the oak, ■ ,
A nd the shouting and the cheering of the boarders
dashing down,
But the tradeship’s gentle soul
Loves the tender lap and roll
Of the white-caps making music on the road to
London-town.
Low, sleeping low, as the live.ships come and go
in their tarnished, torn attire,
They who swung from London-town, they who
took the purple down
Into Carthage out of Tyre.
Oh, the gilded barge of Caesar! oh, the cohorts
golden mailed !
But, oh! the green lolcos on the morn that Jason
sailed !
Breams, dreaming dreams, lie the Suffete s proud
triremes
In their silted Punic bays,
And a tramp hulk rests beside with the glory and
the pride
Of the Borias and the Beys.
How fares it with the Builders who wrought so
lovingly ?
What aileth, then, the Builders that they thus
quiet be ?
Nay, ask the brown mounds yonder, I pray ye ask
not me.
Far, rooking far, grinds the galleon on the bar
When the night winds moan and cry ;
’Tween her curved ribs —shotted yet —
Culverin and falconet,
With the linstocks rusting by.
Ho, Master Thomas Fleming,
Why swings your mains’l round ?.
The great Armada's coming
Up Channel, inward bound,
And I’ve brave news to carry
This morn to Plymouth Sound.
Sore, smitten sore by a jaggkl saw-toothed shore,
By the broadswords of the waves,
■i j With,their spewed freights rotting slov
While the live ships. come and go,

Out of,darkness, out of light, slain at noontime,
killed'at night, , o
By-wrack, by fire, by wounds untold—
In his eyes her blind eyes^stare
On her fleshless fingers there--
See ! love-locked yet the hoop of gold.
Gray, waiting gray for the Trump of Judgment
Day . ,
Where the gorged seas groaning spreaa,
Lie the Lost Fleets biding deep,
' Lie tfie Squadrons all asleep—
Lie the Squadrons of' the Dead!
E. J. BRADY.
An Egotist.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
His first impression on .reading the letter was one
of-unreality. It had been lying opposite his seat
at -table, and,- with a premonitory chill, lie had
torn open the envelope and tilted back his chair
to read. He went over it again, as in a dream,
but a third reading accentuated the phrases and
brought acutely to his mind all that the loss of
her meant. He looked up to find the others en-
grossed with their meal, abd wondered angrily that
there should be such indifference to his pain.
Then, catching glances in his direction, he crammed
the letter in a pocket and made a pretence at eat-
lest anyone should guess at his discomfiture.
Dinner over, he hastened to his room and read
her letter., again and again, noting, through a
maze of wonderment, here a trick of words, there
the lapses into an accustomed endearment. Sit-
ting idly on the bed, he absorbed slowly the multi-
plicity of her conflicting reasons, as also her confi-
dent assumption of his agreement in them ; then
wondered vaguely if he were hurt—if this dull
numbness meant bitter anguish, or - merely emo-
tional disappointment. , . „
She was returning his letters and ring:. He
affected a contemptuous laugh—tribute to an imagi-
nary audience. His ring ! To be treasured as the
tombstone of his love? This, obtruding on his
reflections as rather neat, was made a note of to
use in his reply. , , '
He was taking it very well, he thought. De-
cidedly, there were few men who, loving her as
he did—had done— would have accepted her defec-
tion so philosophically. And, after all, there
were compensations. Freedom offered a wider
scope for enjoyment than a life of domesticity.
Some theatre-tickets and a tailor s bill stuck in
his mirror suggested the fact that he had never
denied himself a pleasure. He met this with the re-
flection that future indulgences would, at anyrate,
be without conscience-qualms. He was tired, too,
of writing—of the weekly repetition of word-
caressings. She had complained of the coldness
of his letters. But it was impossible to be always
at fever-heat. There had, too, been demauds on
his time and purse, which he had found it difficult
to explain or even specify. Women never under-
stood these things. She wrote of the delay, the
frequent postponements, and the long years of
weary waiting. - Well, riches were not to be won
in a day, and he was no selfish egoist to ask a
woman to share poverty merely because she; loved
him. That her younger sister and two girl friends
had married in the interval had no bearing on
their case. It was so like a womans logic
to quote these: facts as it were in reproach
to him. She had known at the time of their en-
gagement what bis prospects were. He had been
perfectly honest in defining his position, .And it
she had not been prepared, to wait, why had
g| ie - f The longer he considered, the clearer it
became that she had treated him very badly.
Still, she was a woman. He. would be generous
W The question of what his reply should .be came
to him. This needed consideration, for it was
imperative that she should recognise her position
and her loss. It would be futile to pretend he
had never loved her, just as it would be absurd to
refute her arguments. Women, he reflected,
never reasoned. , , ...
Remembering she had always dreaded his sar-
casm, he decided that an admixture of bitterness
and cynicism would prove more effective. I.he
desire to look well, to present the best possible
appearance, was fast possessing him. . .
He was soon absorbed in the. composition or ms
reply, almost to the exclusion of his earlier feel-
ings. After many alterations, he completed a
fair copy, and read it oyer with satisfaction. A
particular phrase fitted in so. well with his admir-
ation of himself as to raise him almost to exalta-
tion. . .. . . ,
“Now, I call that good,” he said, surveying
himself in his mirror as though for confirmative
applause. “Damned good !” A momentary;re-
gret that he would not be present, to witness its
effect on her somewhat chilled his enthusiasm.
Pride in his handiwork increased till a craving for
sympathetic appreciation dominated all his pre-
vious emotions. , , ,
“ I wonder if old Strong is m ? he said, hand-
ling his letter with an almost caressing, care.
“ I’ll go and read this to him. He’ll enjoy ic.J’
E. &. O. E.
During May Westralia gained 717 people
by excess of arrivals over departures. In July,
’9B, it gained 1494, and in Aug. ’9B, 402. Then
there were seven months of decrease till in April,
’99, the Red Dust Land showed a gain of 72.
Last month’s figures look almost like a definite
turning of the tide westward once more.
The next selector in N.S.W. to ask for
help from the State will probably be the home-
stead lessee—the patient long person who is con-
fined to the west country, where he has the great
privilege of trying to make a living from 10,240
acres of rolling sandhills and mulga ridges. With
good prices, 10,240 acres served his modest pur-
poses until the best land was taken ; but now he
is left with bad prices and worse country
(practically all the river frontages are gone),
laud that has been over-stocked, and, in many
cases, eaten out by the squatter (who naturally
takes all he can out of that part of his run which
he may lose any day). When he has any enterprise
to speak of, he sets a dummy to work for him ; when
he is too tired, he exists on pumpkins and rabbits,
and does a bit of fencing or tank-sinking at prices
which mean starvation for the ordinary bush-
worker. The appeal will therefore most likely be
for a bigger area ; as for rent, he pays hardly any
as it is.
Woman’s Way.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Two people. He, coming down the street, well-
dressed, .well set-up, jaunty, . She going up-,street,
tall, slim, calmly indifferent. ' They come within
a few yards of reach other,. still serenely un-
conscious. Now, but a few paces separate them ;
the serenity is disturbed. There is a sjight.bow, a
half-stop, progress of a few yards, then a mutual
halt. Both are flushed, both confused. .
Small matter for wonder, this. The last time
they met —arid parted—it was as lovers. .Though
three years have passed since then, neither has for-
gotten that last time. It was her fault. She was
light, inconstant; but she was the first to recover
composure.
“Fancy meeting you !’’ she said, “ Have you
been long in town ? ”
He, his eyes fixed on the delicate face with its
set smile, and his mind full of the sweet, tearful
one he had kissed three years before, replied mecha-
nically, “ I arrived yesterday. I came down to
be married, you know.” -
“Did you indeed? I am glad to hear it,” was
the quick response with smiling lips. But the
eyes did not smile ; they were bright and hard as
steel. “ I hope you will be happy.”
Still with his eyes on her face, as in a dream, he
said slowly, “ Thank you !—yes —I —l am sure to
be.”
“Then you will be more fortunate than the
majority of your fellows,” she said. “ But when
is it to be ? ”
As she said this she raised her eyes to his—those
deep, dark, grey eyes—and gave him a long, long
look.
And then the fierce desire, the stamping-down
of which had cost him so many days of anguish,
sprang into being again, and away went prudence,
honor—everything, before that look.
“Never, Ella!” he cried hoarsely, drawing
nearer as he spoke—“ Never I unless you will
marry me. Come with me now. lam afraid to
let you out of my sight. Come, my darling; I
know you love me. You couldn’t look at me like
that and not care. Oh, if you only knew how I
have wanted you ! ”
His eyes were burning; he trembled all over, as
he waited for her answer,
“You do me too much honor,” she said in
coldly-sweet tones. “I am sorry I cannot accept
your offer, but you see my husband expects me
home for dinner. Good- day. Don’t forget to
send me some cake.”
And she continued on her way up-street, a little
smile of triumph disturbing the calm of her face
as she said to herself, “ I thought he couldn’t have
forgotten.”
HELEN INGHAM.
Bishop Julius, of Christchurch, now
spoken of as a probable successor to Bishop
Thornton, of Ballarat, advocated strongly, on
his recent trip to England, the desirableness of
importing curates from Britain, as these latter are
accustomed to low salaries, and would thus teach
young Australian clerics how to live on spare
stipends. But why should Australians who. want
religion take cheap labor in that field more than in
others ?


A rough census of natives “ assigned ” to
settlers in Westralia has lately been made by the
new Dept, entrusted with their care. The total
is 3000, of whom 550 are in the Gascoyne district.
An interesting will-case was spread over
several days at Adelaide Supreme Court lately.
The document in dispute bore the signature of the
black sheep of an ex-Judge’s flock, and conveyed
all his estate except <£‘2oo to the widow who kept
the pub. in which he died. And after there had
been no end of fighting—three Sets of counsel
were engaged—-and a verdict had been given,, costs
came to be argued; whereupon it was disclosed
that practically the whole of the estate consisted
of unsaleable land ! So there is to be further
argument (but this time in Chambers) to decide
how much of the little cash available each counsel
shall get.

SOUNP JUDGMENT.
Sound judgment teaches us that a debilitated system cannot be built up by continued purging which reduces
the strength of a body already weakened by disease. Most so-called blood builders are purgatives.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills eor Pale People do not act on the bowels. They build up the blood and
strengthen the nerves. r
The same sound judgment that leads you to give Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People a trial will prompt
you to refuse any substitute an unscrupulous dealer offers. Anyone who says he has “ something just as good ”
or J same except in name,” is dishonest, and does not deserve your trade. Here is the result of two cases in
which the real Dr. Williams Pink Pills were used.
Consumption and Lung Troubles Conquered.
Mr. Thomas is the manager of a leading general store in Queanbeyan, and a re-
porter, calling upon him recently, found that he had been completely curedof consumption
and serious lung affections of long standing by Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. Mr. Thomas
was attended by a leading physician, who treated him with all the. skill and attention
that was possible, but notwithstanding his treatment the patient did not appear to im-
prove. His medico described the ailment as consumption, and Mr. Thomas was natur-
ally in despair. He was troubled with a persistent dry cough, shortness of breath pains
in the chest and sometimes in the shoulders. He had also a tendency to feverish attacks
and was naturally greatly debilitated by his ailment. In fact, his loss of flesh
and strength was noticeable to all his acquaintances. Other symptoms later on
asserted themselves, and Mr. Thomas would wake up at night literally gasping for
breath. Mr. Thomas’ physician also told him that he feared the presence of asthma
and this naturally made his patient more concerned than ever. The responsibilities of busi-
ness unfortunately aided the disease in its progress, for Mr. Thomas was always a busy man.
At last he heard of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills through reading the newspapers and was
also recommended to try them by a gentleman who had himself been cured by them
In September, ’97, he commenced taking them, and after the first few boxes he felt con-
siderably relieved. Buoyed up with hope he persevered, and improved week by week
until he had used the contents of eight boxes. At this stage he found himself completely
cured of consumption, asthma, and, indeed, of all weakness in his lungs. He became
healthier-lookiner and more robust, and new strength and activity came to his body.
Instead of being depressed and despondent, his spirits became buoyant and hopeful—a
wonderful change to his former condition. Mr. Thomas, in parting with the re-
porter, said : lam most thankful to Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for having cured me
and I shall always heartily recommend them to my friends.”
♦ :
Woman at Forty-Five.
The most critical period in the life of a woman is that known as the “change
of life.” The symptoms are fainting spells or attacks of faintness or dizziness
headache, general debility, exhaustion, a feeling of melancholy, hysteria, pain in the
loins or limbs, hypochondria, etc. The change is one for the better if the patient is sen-
sible enough to fortify the system against the ravages of the attendant symptoms. For
this purpose, no remedy equals Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills..
Rheumatism and Sciatica Vanquished.
(Blayney Advocate and Carcoab Herald.)
A marvellous cure of rheumatism and sciatica having been reported in the town a
reporter from the Blayney Advocate and Carcoar Herald was despatched to obtain
some details of the illness and cure of - Mrs. Layland, wife of Mr. John Layland a well-
known and highly-respected resident of Blayney, N.S.W., who is the engineer of th©

I WAS NEVER FREE PROM PAIN.”
railway pump-house. Mrs. Layland readily
consented to give the required information, -
and spoke with great enthusiasm in praise of
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. “ For fourteen
years,” said she, “I suffered excruciating
pains from rheumatism in the arm—so that
I could not raise my hand to my head. It
affected my arms from the shoulders to the
finger-ends ; my hands were swelled up, and
I couldn’t move my fingers. I also had
sciatica in the left leg and couldn’t walk
about. The illness affected me more in the
wintertime. A doctor was attending me
all the while, and although he was very
attentive to me, his medicines only gave me
temporary relief. I also tried Eucalyptus
and patent medicines, but got no bene-
fit from any. I was never entirely free
from pain, and I got that way that I did
not care what happened to me. About
eighteen months ago, a lady_ friend, who
used to come and help me to do my housework, recommended me to try Dr. Williams’
innk Bills. At. first, I refused to give them a trial, as I had sDent such a lot of monev
in taking medicines without deriving any benefit. But my friend persuaded me to take
anc * tnankful I am of it, for after I had used a few boxes, I was thoroughly cured
and nave not had a pain since. I can now get about and do my housework, and after

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
‘‘No, I oan’t share you with another woman—
and I won’t. You must marry, I see that; so we
must part, old boy.” ,
She was sitting on a stool at his feet. He was
lying back in a deep chair, watching her curiously
as she leaned her head against his knee and gazed
regretfully into the fire.
After a silence she went on :
“ I’m not going to complain ; I have had a real
good time with you. I knew the end must come,
and it has. I only made one mistake,” she
added, thoughtfully : “ I cared too much for you ;
but you must not suffer for that. I can honestly
hope that you will be happy in return for the four
years you have given me.”
She ceased speaking as she felt her voice getting
suspiciously shaky. He bent forward impul-
sively : ‘
“ What a good little girl you are, Nita ! Some
women would have fussed and raged, and made a
scene fit for a melodrama, but you are a dear, good
little girl.”
“ Why should I rage? I have had a good time.
Do you remember how you found me, an anaemic
apprentice ? Why, since I have known you, I
have had this jolly little room, smart frocks—a
thing unknown to me before—and you. I have
tasted heaven, even if it can’t last for ever.”
She threw her arms behind her head, and her
eyes glowed with recollections.
“ I believe you make me feel ashamed of my-
self,” he said, tugging at his moustache, “ and
that s a thing I’m not used to. I wish I could
leave you all this, but I wouldn’t be marrying if
it wasn’t for my cursed hard-upness.”
Must the room go, Gordon? Yes, of course,”
she answered herself. “ Besides, I should hate it
without you.” She looked with hard eyes round
the pretty room, its dainty cushions, luxurious
chairs, elegant pictures and lamps ; but as her gaze
returned to him her eyes softened. “ What shall
Ido without you?” she moaned. I shall have
nothing nothing in the world.” She swayed on
the stool, and he, fearing she would fall, drew her
gently into his arms. She sat with her head rest-
ing on his shoulder, while the tears rolled silently
down her cheeks. He appeared not to notice, but
stroked her hair gently as he spoke :
“You’re a brick, Nita ! I can’t tell you how I
thank you for not giving way to hysterics. It’s
awful to have to part from you, little woman. If
only we could go on as we are ; but I needn’t bore
you again with the details ; you know why I have
to —leave you.”
“ Yes ; and you are not to worry about me. I
will be quite fit in a little while. Of course, I feel
it a bit just now—but I’ll soon be all right.”
With heroic attempt at cheerfulness, she went
on : “ But it does seem funny to think of you, a
married man, with little Gordons and Gordotiesses.
Now, doesn’t it ? I suppose you will sit round the
fire and be very domestic, won’t you ? ”

I have the right to, if I want it; if lam ready
to work for it. I have nothing else. No one
cares for me. You are going to leave me—to have
your children. She looked at him with challenge
in her eyes.
“ Nita, you’re mad ! mad ! ”

child. 1 don t care who knows. lam willing to

Cordon, she went on pleadingly ; “it will be the
saving of me. You know I am not a bad girl,
but if I am left all alone it will be hard to keep
straight. Think—if I had a child of yours to
take care of—can’t you see, and feel, and know
that it would be the saving of me? You must see
it—you must! ”
He paced up and down the room feverishly •
then came to her, and took her hands.
“ Little woman, you don’t know what you’re
saying ! It’s sheer madness to think of such a
thing.”
She pulled her hands away impatiently.
Will you let me think,” he said, “and try to
your point of view? It’s such a staggering
thing to think of in a moment.”
“Gordon, you must see it in my light. Go
away and think about it—but I must have some-
thing to make up.”
She sank down on the couch, sobbing. He bent
down and kissed her neck ; then as she waved him
away, he silently left the room.

It was a drizzling night in June, but the theatre
was full; a new London company had just started
its season. During the interval Gordon Paterson
left his seat, and formed one of the procession to
the bars outside. Entering one with a friend, he
gave an absent-minded order for drinks.
“ Water or soda, sir ? ” said the showily-dressed
barmaid and something familiar in the voioe
made him look up at her.
! his lips formed rather than spoke the
you r ’ >a *' erson l It’s a long time since I saw
Her voice was not as he remembered it. It
sounded hard and throaty. Without wait-
ing tor an answer she flounced off to finish
an interrupted flirtation with a young man who
lounged familiarly across the counter. Gordon
.Paterson stayed and watched her. He heard her
cough as she received the benefit of her admirer’s
smoke in her face and, as they laughed, he saw
the cough take hold of her slight frame till she
shook with it. Making some excuse to his friend,
he waited till the interval was over and the bar
emptied of its loungers ; then went up to her and
Sa i« ttti \ n ? usfc speak to you, but not here.”
What for? What’s the use? ” She looked at
him with hard, bright eyes, but he could see she
was k-embling and pale under her paint.
Hon t speak to me like that! Where can I
see you? he repeated firmly.
‘‘Oh, anywhere you like ; I don’t care.”
«he gave him an address, and he went away
with the sound of her flippant laugh ringing in
ms ©tirs.
* • * .
es > S |F j n ’ore,” said the little slattern who
answered the bell, as she preceded him down a
dark passage and knocked at a door
“Miss Merrick, are yer in? ’Ere’s another
gentleman to see yer.”
“ All right, ’Melia, let him in.”
When she saw Gordon she made a pathetic
attempt to regain her dignity. He could see she
was ill and had been resting, but, man like, he
was merciless.
“ Well ? ” he asked.
« ’ s *' e echoed, regaining her spirit.
You ve T found me out, Gordon-Mr. Paterson, I
suppose I ought to say. ”
Nita,” he answered, shivering at the latent
coarseness of her tone, “I did not expect to see
you like this. Don’t you remember the last time
we were together, and all you said? Have you
forgotten what you were going to do ? ”
_ “ Yes, I have forgotten—and a good thing, too.
lhere are some things one is sorry to have said
and I take it all back—-how do you like that ? ” ’
Hetyfried away in disgust, almost thinking he
would leave her, but he felt he must find out what
had happened to bring her to her present con-
dition.
Don t talk to me like that. Can’t you try to
be your old self ? ”
My old self ! Good God, no !’’ She threw
her arms up with a forlorn dramatic gesture.
Heaven preserve me from my old self ! ”
“ Where is the child ?” he said sternly, taking
her hands in a hard grip. Not amongst all this ! ”
The child is all right,” she answered, throwing
off his hands, then deliberately watching him.
“The child is dead ! ”
“ Dead ! ” he echoed.
Yes, dead. Well ! Isn’t that better than being
alive, with a mother like me? Isn’t if, I say?”
with a fierce stamp. “I suppose you’ve got a
right to know all about it, so T’ll tell you.”
“ When he was born he was a fine baby, and I
worked and kept straight for him. It was hard to
get work ; when folks found out about him T was
turned off, but I managed to get on pretty well.
He never wanted, anyhow. I had to run a bit
short myself, but I didn’t care as long as he was
well. And he was fond of me. Good God, how
that baby loved me ! All night I would feel his
little warm body next to mine, and sometimes I’d
wake m the night just to look at him. When he
got bigger he d come running to meet me when
my work was done. It was something to come
home quickly for—to see him standing at the gate
wavmg to me. I tell you I was straight enough
while 1 had him to keep mo straight. But
when ' le went—l didn’t much care what became
ot me. What did it matter ? ”
dicl,l,t you let me know? How did he
die !
“ One day ” she went on in a sullen, quiet
voice, as I was coming home, he ran out to
meet ine, and a horse came bolting round the cor-
ner and knocked him down—that’s all. We took
him to the hospital ; but it was no good.”
‘ Nita, my poor girl ! ”
His kindly tone broke down the last remnant
ot her firmness.
“ My God, my God ! ” she cried wildly. “ Don’t
speak to me like that. He was all I had, and was
taken. If he d been left me, I’d be a good woman
to-day—instead of this /”
He waited until she had worn herself out and
the fit of coughing had finished; then he spoke
hastily : You must get out of this, Nita, _ You
must go away. 11l see to it.. You shall go into
the country and get strong.”
“It’s too late,” she said, hollowly. “The
doctor is always telling me to take care of myself,
or I .won’t see the winter through. But I don’t
take care. I think that way is best. I wanted to
kill myself when he died, but I was frightened. I
was ill just after, and I hoped I would die, but
they nursed me back to this hell of a life. Any-
way, I can’t last long. ” -
He extracted a promise that she would go'away
if he made all the arrangements, but she acquiesced
with a quiet smile, as if she knew better.
A week later he received at his office a mote,
scribbled in pencil on a scrap of paper :
“ The doctor says I can’t last the night. .Will
you promise to see that I am buried next our
child?”
He took his hat and hurried out.

**l wish to say to every one that I have used a great deal of Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla in my family. I believe it is the best family medicine there is
in the world. , M
“ Once, while I was on a vessel trading to the East Indies and also while I
was living in Calcutta, I used Ayer’s Sarsaparilla for impurities in my blood,
and with the best results. I always took a stock of it with me when I went on
my voyages.. I could not feel safe without it. For eruptions of the skin, boils,
and such affections it is a quick and sure cure. I recommend it to everybody
suffering from impurities in the blood, showing itself in any way whatsoever.”
This is what Mr. W. A. Lindsay (whose portrait, with that of his wife and
child, is here given), of Stanthorpe, Queensland, Australia, thinks of Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla. Because of the multitude of such cases, the people call Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla
“The World’s Greatest Family Medicine.”
Because some other preparation may be called a sarsaparilla is not the
slightest reason that it is anything like “Ayer’s” Sarsaparilla. If you wish
these quick results, these safe results, these sure results, you must insist upon
getting “Ayer’s.” Make a particular point of this.
